ABSTRACT
Background: Recurrent genetic abnormalities that correlate with clinical features
could be used to determine patients’ prognosis, select treatments and predict
responses to therapy. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) contains genomic
alterations of undefined clinical significance. We aimed to identify mutually exclusive
mutations that are frequently detected in ESCCs and characterized their associations
with clinical variables.
Methods: We analyzed next-generation-sequencing data from 104 ESCCs from
Taihang Mountain region of China; 96 pairs were selected for deep target-capturebased validation and analysis of clinical and pathology data. We used model proposed
by Szczurek to identify exclusive mutations and to associate these with pathology
findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazards model

response to chemotherapy. Findings were validated in an analysis of samples from
89 patients with ESCC from Taihang Mountain.
Results: We identified statistically significant mutual exclusivity between
mutations in NOTCH1 and PIK3CA in ESCC samples. Mutations in NOTCH1 were
associated with well-differentiated, early-stage malignancy and less metastasis to
regional lymph nodes. Nonetheless, patients with NOTCH1 mutations had shorter
survival times than patients without NOTCH1 mutations, and failed to respond to
chemotherapy. In contrast, patients with mutations in PIK3CA had better responses
to chemotherapy and longer survival times than patients without PIK3CA mutations.
Conclusions: In a genetic analysis of ESCCs from patients in China, we identified
mutually exclusive mutations in NOTCH1 and PIK3CA. These findings might increase
our understanding of ESCC development and be used as prognostic factors.

INTRODUCTION

District, Southern China [7] or the Cancer Institute
and Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
(CICAMS), where patients come from all over the country
[8, 9]. Moreover, we previously performed an NGS study
on 104 ESCC patients who were recruited from Shanxi
and Henan provinces, combined with mutation set of 17
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and 71 whole-exome
sequencing (WES) from Chaoshan District and reported
their mutational signatures and identified driver genes
or pathways that contributed to ESCC [10]. In large
collections of tumor samples, it has been observed that
alterations that affect the same cancer pathways tend
to not co-occur in the same patient. Mutual exclusivity
may arise, because alteration of only one pathway
component is sufficient to deregulate the entire process.
Such mutually exclusive alterations have frequently been
observed and have been associated with pathological and
clinical features; thus, they can serve as molecular markers
for potential categorization of tumors and prediction of
the prognosis and treatment response of patients [11, 12].
Detecting such patterns is important for understanding
cancer progression and prognosis and could suggest genes
for targeted treatment or markers for the improvement
of treatment in patients [13]. Some mutually exclusive
alterations in the genomes of ESCC patients have been
identified but not studied very much, and no reliable
molecular markers for diagnosing or predicting patient
outcomes have been identified for this disease [8, 9].
In this study, we describe the identification and
validation of mutually exclusive mutational patterns of
NOTCH1 and PIK3CA, two significantly mutated genes
(SMGs) identified in ESCC via genomic analyses [7-10],
and their associations with clinical variables.

Esophageal cancer causes 400,200 deaths each
year and represents the sixth leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide [1]. It is categorized into esophageal
adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC) [1]. China has the highest incidence and mortality
rate of ESCC in the world; approximately 70% of
worldwide ESCC cases occur in China, where it is ranked
the fourth most lethal cancer [2]. The risk of developing
ESCC in China has been linked to factors such as gender,
dietary habits, and family history. Alcohol abuse and
tobacco consumption represent minor factors in highrisk populations in China [2]. Currently, the treatment of
ESCC relies on surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
combinations of these [3]. Although many reports have
indicated that patients who receive chemoradiation therapy
had a significantly better 5-year survival rate than patients
who did not, it is unclear why certain patients respond
better than others to chemotherapy [3]. It is common
for patients to be either under- or over-treated in China,
which results in increased chemoresistance or treatment
toxicity [4]. Therefore, unambiguous molecular markers
are needed to identify which patients are likely to respond
best to particular treatments, and thereby avoid undertreatment or over-treatment .
ESCC has a striking geographic distribution
worldwide, with a higher prevalence in certain restricted
areas of China [5]. Specifically, Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei
provinces (the Taihang Mountains in North-Central China)
are the so-called “esophageal cancer belt” with extremely
high incidences of ESCC compared with the elsewhere in
China and the rest of the world (Supplementary Figure 1);
over 20% of all deaths in this area have been attributed to
this cancer [5].
Epidemiological and etiological studies have shown
that environmental and genetic factors play crucial roles
in esophageal carcinogenesis [6]. Recently, genome-wide
investigations have characterized genomic alterations in
ESCC [7-9]. For these next-generation sequencing (NGS)
studies, patients were enrolled from either Chaoshan

selection during tumorigenesis. Mutations of SMGs are
likely to be ‘drivers’ in pathogenesis and these genes may
affect the biology of a given tumor [7-10]. We and others
previously identified SMGs in ESCC patients, including
TP53, NOTCH1, PIK3CA, FAT1, CDKN2A, FBXW7,
ZNF750, AJUBA, and others [7-10]. We firstly assessed
mutational exclusivity among these SMGs as described
previously [14]. Most strikingly, an exclusion pattern was
observed between the NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutations in
cohort #1 (Figure 1A). Although one patient was found,
and further validated via PCR-Sanger sequencing, with
concomitant mutations of NOTCH1 and PIK3CA, the
frequency of double mutations was 0.0096, which is not
significantly different from 0.0 by chi-squared analysis. To
further test this observation, we extended the exclusivity
analysis to cohort #2 and three other previously published
NGS datasets of ESCC patients (cohorts #3 [7], #4 [8],

#5 [9]). Even in this expanded series, mutual exclusivity
between the NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutations was found
(Figure 1B-E). When the tumors from cohorts #1 and #2
(n=193), that recruited patients from Taihang Mountains
and exhibited similar pattern of NOTCH1 and PIK3CA
mutations, were combined, this mutually exclusive pattern
between NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutations was highly
significant (Figure 1F). Together, these data suggest that
there is a strong inverse relationship between the NOTCH1
and PIK3CA mutations in ESCC that was previously
undiscovered.
Additionally, the mutated frequency and mutated
sites of these two genes were different among ESCC
cohorts. The overall frequency of tumor samples with
NOTCH1 or PIK3CA mutations in cohort #1 or #2
was statistically higher than that of cohort #3 or #4
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Moreover, the frequencies

34 patients were treated by surgery alone. Additionally,
89 ESCC patients with a median age of 59.1 years and a
median OS of 42.66 months were enrolled in cohort #2.
All 89 patients received standard chemotherapy (NCCN
guidelines). We then looked for correlations between the
NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutations and clinical parameters.
In cohort #1, NOTCH1 mutations were significantly
associated with well-differentiation (P = 0.001) and an
absence of regional lymph node metastases (N0, P =
0.002), and were dramatically enriched in stage I tumors
(P = 0.011, Table 1). We then validated this analysis in
cohort #2. The association of NOTCH1 mutations with
tumor stage and lymph node metastasis also held true
in this cohort (P < 0.0001, Supplementary Table 2).
Furthermore, the relevance of NOTCH1 mutations to
lymph node metastasis was confirmed in our previously

Based on the mutually exclusivity of NOTCH1
and PIK3CA, ESCC patients could be divided into three
groups: patients with NOTCH1 mutations, patients with
PIK3CA mutations, and patients without mutations of
either gene (Supplementary Table 4). We extended our
survival analysis in these groups and found that patients
with PIK3CA mutations had a significantly longer OS
(median OS of 80.9 months) than patients without
mutations in either gene (median OS 40 months) (log-rank
P = 0.026, Figure 4A; Cox regression analysis, P = 0.037,
Figure 4B). Notably, although NOTCH1 mutations were
significantly associated with tumor well-differentiation,
early pathologic stage, and low lymph node metastasis,
patients with NOTCH1 mutations tended to have an even
shorter OS than patients with PIK3CA mutations; the OS
of patients with NOTCH1 mutations was not different from
that of patients without mutations in these two genes (Cox
regression analysis, P = 0.144, Figure 4B). A similar trend
was observed in cohort #2 (Figure 4C-D) and combined
cohorts #1 and #2 (Supplementary Figure 3). PIK3CA
mutations correlate with OS (Cox regression analysis,
P < 0.001, HR=0.002, 95% CI: 0.0-0.038, Figure 4D),
whereas NOTCH1 mutations show no correlation with OS
(Cox regression analysis, P = 0.561, Figure 4D). Apart
from NOTCH1 and PIK3CA, no SMGs were statistically
associated with clinical variables. Although FAM135B and
EP300 were associated with OS in previous studies [7,
9], we did not observe any such statistically significant
association in our cohort.

published cohort #3 (P = 0.011, Supplementary Table
3) [7]. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that
the NOTCH1 mutations were associated with ESCC
metastasis; ESCC patients who harbor NOTCH1
mutations show less risk of metastasis. However, PIK3CA
mutations were not correlated with clinicopathological
characteristics, including tumor differentiation, pathologic
stage, and lymph node metastasis.
Next, we used Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess
the impact of NOTCH1 or PIK3CA mutations on OS
in cohort #1 and validated it in cohort #2. The patients
showed a median OS of 60 months and 80 months for the
NOTCH1-mutated and NOTCH1-wild type (WT) groups,
respectively, in cohort #1 (Table 1). Surprisingly, although
ESCC patients with NOTCH1 mutations showed less risk
of metastasis, the association of NOTCH1 mutations with
OS was not statistically significant (Log-rank (MantelCox), P = 0.310, Figure 2A; Cox regression analysis, P =
0.318, Figure 2B). This observation was further validated
in cohort #2 (Cox regression analysis, P = 0.565, Figure
2D). We did, however, find a significant effect on OS for
the PIK3CA mutations. The PIK3CA mutations showed a
positive correlation with OS (log-rank P = 0.048) in cohort
#1 (Figure 3A). This trend reached statistical significance
in cohort #2 (Cox regression analysis, P < 0.001, adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) = 0.031, 95% confidence intervals (CI):
0.006-0.158, Figure 3D) and combined cohort #1 and #2
(P = 0.003, adjusted HR = 0.241, 95% CI: 0.094-0.622,
Supplementary Figure 2E). These data indicate that the
PIK3CA mutation may be a marker of favorable prognosis
for ESCC patients from the population in Taihang

standard chemotherapy, 70.6% (12 out of 17) exhibited
failure of chemotherapy. Surprisingly, we found no benefit
of standard chemotherapy for patients with NOTCH1
mutations compared to those with mutations in neither
gene (P = 0.389, Fisher’s exact test). Conversely, having
a PIK3CA mutation was associated with a better response
than having mutations in neither gene (P = 0.026, Fisher’s
exact test). Of 13 patients with PIK3CA mutations who
received standard chemotherapy, only 23% (3 out of 13)
showed failure of chemotherapy. Moreover, patients with
PIK3CA mutations showed significantly better responses
than those with NOTCH1 mutations (P = 0.01, Fisher’s
exact test, Figure 5A, right panel).
We validated this trend in cohort #2, who all
received standard chemotherapy treatment. This cohort
included 18 patients with NOTCH1 mutations, 14 patients
with PIK3CA mutations, and 57 patients mutations in
neither gene. Patients in cohort #2 had a median OS of
44.6 months, with a median OS of 32.78 months for
patients with NOTCH1 mutations and 60 months for

In cohort #1, 70 patients received standard
chemotherapy, including 16 patients with NOTCH1
mutations, 12 patients with PIK3CA mutations, 1 patient
with both the NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutations, and 41
patients with neither NOTCH1 nor PIK3CA mutations
(Supplementary Table 5). Of the 70 patients who received
standard chemotherapy, 31 patients responded effectively
to chemotherapy; 39 had either tumor progression or
tumor recurrence, which were considered to be treatment
failures. The median OS of the 70 patients who received
standard chemotherapy was 53.48 months. Patients
with NOTCH1 mutations showed a median OS of
27.09 months, whereas those with PIK3CA mutations
showed a median OS of 80 months. We then evaluated
the association between the NOTCH1 and PIK3CA
genotype and the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Of
17 patients who had NOTCH1 mutations and received

those with PIK3CA mutations. A total of 13 out of 18
patients with NOTCH1 mutations failed to respond to
chemotherapy, whereas 12 out of 14 patients with PIK3CA
mutations responded to chemotherapy (P = 0.001, Fisher’s
exact test, Supplementary Figure 4A and Supplementary
Table 5), consistent with the trend seen in cohort #1.
Next, we examined the effects of NOTCH1 and
PIK3CA mutations on the progression-free survival (PFS)
of patients in cohorts #1 and #2 who received standard

chemotherapy. As expected, patients in cohort #1 with
PIK3CA mutations showed significantly longer PFS than
those with NOTCH1 mutations by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
(P = 0.018, Figure 5B) and univariate analyses (P = 0.03,
HR = 4.124, 95% CI: 1.145-14.86, Figure 5C). A similar
trend was observed in cohort #2 (Supplementary Figure
4B-C). Our data suggest that patients with NOTCH1
mutations, who are likely to exhibit a better outcome
without chemotherapy, might suffer unnecessarily

from side effects of chemotherapy. However, patients
with PIK3CA mutations could benefit from standard
chemotherapy, and could thus survive longer. Therefore,
PIK3CA mutational status may have a potential role as
a biomarker for standard chemotherapy and prognosis in
ESCC patients from Taihang Mountains, Northern China.

Moreover, our results suggest that patients who harbor
NOTCH1 mutations have a statistically significant
association with well differentiation, an early stage of
malignancy, and less regional lymph node metastasis;
however, they exhibited a poor outcome and failure to
respond to standard chemotherapy treatment. In contrast,
patients who harbor PIK3CA mutations showed a
better response to standard chemotherapy and exhibited
favorable survival. Recently, the systematic analysis of
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer mutation
data set across 12 major cancer types revealed 14 mutually
exclusive pairs among 127 SMGs, including pairs of
TP53 and PIK3CA with significant exclusivity in breast
adenocarcinoma[12]. However, mutual exclusivity
between NOTCH1 and PIK3CA, which was identified as
SMGs via genomic analyses of ESCC patients, has not
previously been implicated in any type of cancer [7-10,
12].
In this study, we observed different patterns of
SMGs, especially different distributions of mutation
frequencies and mutated sites of NOTCH1 and PIK3CA
between ESCC patients from Northern China and those
from Southern China. The frequencies of PIK3CA and
NOTCH1 mutations in cohorts #1 and #2 (from Taihang
Mountain, Northern China) were higher than those of
cohorts #3 (from Chaoshan District, Southern China [7])
and cohorts #4 and #5 (recruited from CICAMS, where
patients came from all over the country and did not have a
limited geographic distribution pattern [8,9]). The possible
reasons for this pattern could be genetic and environmental
etiologic factors [6,12]. In the high-risk areas of China,
there is a strong tendency toward familial aggregation
of ESCC, which suggests that genetic susceptibility in
combination with exposure to environmental risk factors
contributes to the high rates of ESCC in these areas [20].
In addition to ethnicity, other possible etiologic factors
such as lifestyle patterns, nutritional deficiencies, and
mycotoxin-contaminated foods could play important roles
in these high-risk areas [21-24]. Therefore, the different
environmental carcinogens between northern and southern
China might cause different genetic diversity (e.g.,
mutational pattern of SMGs) in ESCC individuals from
the Taihang Mountains and Chaoshan area.
Patients diagnosed at early stage of cancer
progression may exhibit better survival over time [25].
NOTCH1 was mutated in around 20% out of ESCC
patients, and correlated with well differentiation, early
TNM stage, and absence of regional lymph node
metastases. The close link between NOTCH1 mutation
types and clinicopathological features leads us to speculate
that ESCC patients with NOTCH1 mutations may have
a better prognosis. However, we did not observe such
correlation in our patients. Meanwhile, a worse response
to standard chemotherapy was observed on patients with
NOTCH1 mutations compared to those with PIK3CA

ESCC
In general, abnormalities of poor prognostic factors
are found in more malignant and advanced cancer cells
[1]. However, in our study, we found frequent NOTCH1
mutations in early-stage malignancy and less metastasis to
regional lymph nodes, but with poor prognosis in ESCC
patients. In China, patients with ESCC medically unfit
for surgery if the tumor was relapsed. Therefore, we had
very rare relapsed tumors to analyze NOTCH1 mutation
status. Alternatively, we performed mutation analysis of
NOTCH1 in regional metastatic lymph nodes from 37 of
stage III ESCC patients in cohort #1 and 19 of stage III
ESCC patients in cohort #2. We found none of NOTCH1
mutations in these regional metastatic lymph nodes,
further supporting that NOTCH1 mutations associated with
early stage and non-lymph node metastasis. Furthermore,
we performed functional analysis of NOTCH1-W745X,
which located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) like
ligand-binding domain. In light of previous literatures,
functional studies have shown that NOTCH1 gene
suppress proliferation and promote differentiation of
keratinocytes [15]. Similarly, conditional NOTCH1knockout (mice) develop cutaneous epithelial tumors,
and transgenic mice expressing a pan-NOTCH1 inhibitor
develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas [16-17]. The
tumor-suppressive role for NOTCH1 in squamous cells is
also supported by recent sequencing studies of related
tumor types, such as squamous cell carcinomas of the head
and neck, skin, and lung [15,18-19]. Consistently, a tumorsuppressive role for NOTCH1 in ESCC was supported by
MTT assay in KYSE150 and KYSE140 cells (Figure 6AB). However, we observed no correlation of NOTCH1
gene with cell migration and invasion as monitored by the
iCELLigence RTCA DP system (Figure 6C-D), indicating
that NOTCH1 may involve cell proliferation but not
migration and invasion in ESCC cells. Together with our
genetic observations, these functional data indicate that
NOTCH1 may act as a tumor suppressor via regulating
tumor growth but not metastasis in ESCC.

DISCUSSION
A striking finding of this study is the previously
unreported, significant mutually exclusive mutational
pattern between NOTCH1 and PIK3CA in ESCC.

stage of the cancer at diagnosis and the status whether or
not patient has received chemotherapy [26]. However,
while chemotherapy remains the backbone of current
cancer treatment, it is limited by a narrow therapeutic
index, significant toxicity leading to severe side effects
and frequent acquired resistance [27]. Considering that
NOTCH1 mutations associated with early stage and
non-lymph node metastasis that was supporting by both
genetics alterations and functional study, however, no
statistically significant differences in patient outcome and
standard chemotherapy benefit were observed in patients
contained NOTCH1 mutations, we speculate that there is a
possibility that patients harbor NNOTCH1 mutations who
should exhibit a better outcome may suffer side-effect of
chemotherapy or receive extra treatment. These obstacles
call for novel therapeutic approaches for these patients.
Recently, the role of NOTCH signaling in cancers
has been reported, with NOTCH signaling having both
oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles, depending on
the cellular context [20]. In our and others’ cohorts of
ESCC patients, many of the missense mutations in the
NOTCH1 gene occurred at or near identified important

domains, such as the ligand-binding domain (EGF repeats)
and the majority of the mutations were predicted to alter
the protein N-terminal to the transmembrane region.
Moreover, the nonsense mutations (e.g. c.2234G>A:p.
Trp745*) observed in NOTCH1 gene generate a premature
stop codon, which results in a truncated NOTCH1 protein
that lacks the C-terminal domain, which contains a
proline-glutamate-serine-threonine (PEST) sequence
and is important for transcription activation. Thus,
although the activating mutations in NOTCH1 were
identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic
lymphoblastic leukemia, and breast cancer [21-23], the
pattern of the mutations in genes that involve the NOTCH
pathway suggests its potential tumor suppressing roles in
ESCC, as has been reported for head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and
lung squamous cell carcinoma [20, 24]. This interpretation
is consistent with the functional studies of the role of
NOTCH1 in ESCC cells, as NOTCH1 depletion promotes
tumor cell proliferation in tissue culture. Inhibition of
NOTCH1 pathway has been shown to sensitize cancer cells
to chemotherapy in prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, colon

cancer, and glioma [28-31]. Recent studies have aimed
to develop antibodies against specific NOTCH receptors
and ligands with the hope of limiting side effects while
providing the same therapeutic benefit as gamma secretase
inhibitors (drugs that inhibit NOTCH signaling); these
studies were carried out in human cancers with commonly
overactivated mutations in NOTCH1 that confer a survival
advantage on the tumors, leading to poorer outcomes for
the patients [15, 27]. However, owing to the potential
tumor suppressing roles rather than the oncogenic function
of NOTCH1 in ESCC, targeting NOTCH signaling might
not be helpful for treating ESCC.
In accordance with the previous literature [32,
34], the PIK3CA mutation could serve as a favorable
predictive biomarker in ESCC patients from Taihang
Mountains, Northern China. However, PIK3CA mutations
were not associated with patient outcomes in ESCC
patients from the Chaoshan population, Southern China
(cohort #3) and from CICAMS, which does not have any
geographic distribution limitations (cohort #5) [7, 9].
Possible reasons for the conflicting results include the
mutation frequency, mutation sites of PIK3CA, or perhaps
the sample size of the cohorts. In addition to the different
mutation frequencies of PIK3CA among the cohorts, the
most common tumor-associated PIK3CA mutations (those
involving the helical domain (exon 9: c.1624G>A:p.
Glu542Lys and c.1633G>A:p.Glu545Lys) or the kinase
domain (exon 20: c.3140A>G:p.His1047Arg)) had
significantly different frequencies among these cohorts.
In previous studies, the c.1633G>A:p.Glu545Lys and
c.3140A>G:p.His1047Arg mutations have been implicated
in favorable overall survival in the ESCC patients [33, 34].
PIK3CA has been named as the key oncogenic effector
and could be a potential driver mutation in tumorigenesis
of ESCC [35] and these mutants have previously shown
oncogenic effects in vivo and may act as a p otential
target site of treatment as in other cancer types[36].
We speculate that the lower frequency of mutations
in PIK3CA hotspots in cohort #5 results in a negative
association between PIK3CA mutations and survival.
Moreover, our previous mutational signature analysis
showed that hotspot mutations (c.1624G>A:p.Glu542Lys,
c.1633G>A:p.Glu545Lys) of PIK3CA were significantly
enriched in ESCC tumors that had an apolipoprotein B
mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic (APOBEC) signature in
both cohort #1 and cohort #3, which implicates APOBEC
activity as a common key driver of PIK3CA mutagenesis
in ESCC patients from Northern or Southern populations
in China [10]. Therefore, the effect of PIK3CA mutations
on survival prognosis might be observed when cohort #3
is extended to increase the sample size.
Together with previously reported NGS data, our
results document for the first time that NOTCH1 and
PIK3CA mutations are mutually exclusive alterations in
ESCC. Although NOTCH1 mutations had a statistically
significant association with well-differentiation, early
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stage of malignancy and less regional lymph node
metastasis in ESCC, patients who harbor NOTCH1
mutations would not benefit from standard chemotherapy,
and alternative therapeutic strategy must be developed for
these patients. Conversely, patients who harbor PIK3CA
mutations could benefit from standard chemotherapy, and
thus PIK3CA mutational status may have a potential role
as a biomarker for standard chemotherapy and prognosis.
These results raise the possibility for the categorization
of ESCC using the mutations of NOTCH1 and PIK3CA.
However, the NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutated samples
represented a small proportion of ESCC, and the majority
of samples had wild-type NOTCH1 and PIK3CA. Further
studies of larger patient cohorts including all stages ESCC
from multiple restricted areas with high incidences of
ESCC will be necessary to validate the mutual exclusivity
of NOTCH1 and PIK3CA and the relationship of these
two genes with clinical features, as well as to further
refine the potential subclassification of ESCC based on
these genetic alterations. Whether they indeed reflect the
biology of ESCC and the patients’ clinical course remains
to be seen. The results could extend our knowledge to
potential molecular diagnosis markers, predicting overall
patient survival and chemotherapy response in a portion of
ESCC patients, which could guide the therapeutic strategy
to combat ESCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the ethical committee
of the Shanxi and Henan, China (IRB of Shanxi Medical
University, Approval No. 2009029, and the Ethics
Committee of Henan Cancer Hospital, Approval No.
2009xjs12). All samples were obtained before treatment
according to the guidelines of the local ethical committees,
and written informed consent was received from all
participants prior to inclusion in the study.

Patient characteristics
A total of 104 ESCC patients from the Taihang
Mountains were recruited as described previously [10].
Pairs of tumors and matched normal tissues from 14
patients underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS,
median coverage of 65×), and 90 pairs of samples
underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES, median
coverage of 132×) [10]. Additionally, to provide highconfidence mutations, 96 pairs of tumors and matched
normal tissue were selected for deep target capture-based
validation (TCS, at least 365×). A detailed description of
next-generation sequencing analysis pipeline is provided
in the Online Methods. All subsequent analyses relied

on these validated data and not on the primary genome
discovery sequence. A summary of clinical characteristics
of the analyzed patients (cohort #1) is presented in Table
1 and Supplementary Table 1. In this cohort, seventy
patients received standard chemotherapy (NCCN
guidelines). Most of the patients had undergone platinum
based chemotherary conbined with 5-fluorouracil (FU) or
paclitaxel. Patients were treated with paclitaxel on the first
day combined with platinum on day 1 or devided into 4-5
days. 5-FU was used from day 1 to day 5 or continuous
infusion combined with platinum as above. A small part of
patients used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous
infusion of 5-FU alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day
during the whole course of treatment . Treatment cycles
were repeated every 3-4 weeks (Supplementary Table 5).
Overall survival (OS) data were available for 95 patients.
We examined the prevalence of overall failure of standard
chemotherapy in cohort #1, with treatment failure as
either occurrence of cancer-related death or emergence
of recurrent tumors in patients who received standard
chemotherapy.
We further validated our results in an extended
ESCC cohort (cohort #2). A total of 89 ESCC patients
from Shanxi and Henan provinces, Taihang Mountains
received standard chemotherapy (NCCN guidelines) and
were randomly assigned to cohort #2 (Supplementary
Table 1-2). The genotype of NOTCH1 and PIK3CA
was analyzed in 89 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tumors by PCR-Sanger sequencing using the paired
primers

(ACCCGATGCGGTTAGAGCC),
1R
(ACACAATAGTGTCTGTGACTCC),
2F
(ACTCCATGCTTAGAGTTGGAG),
and

for

Moreover, we validated our result in another three
independent ESCC mutation datasets: Cohort #3 from our
previous report of 17 WGS and 71 WES samples, which
was recruited from the Chaoshan District of Guangdong
Province, another area that has high ESCC prevalence in
China [7]. Cohort #4 was from Lin et al. of 20 WES and
119 TCS samples, which were recruited from CICAMS
and Linxian Cancer Hospital [8]. Cohort #5 from Gao
et al. contained 113 WES samples, which were recruited
from CICAMS [9].

observed in the patient, with 0 standing for absence and
1 for presence of alteration. We define the set of model
parameters
with coverage γ, impurity
δ, false positive rate α and false negative rate ß; and
a set of random variables including variable C that
indicates patient coverage, variable H that specifies the
single exclusively mutated gene in a covered patient,
variable T that represent the true alterations of genes,
and variable Y that correspond to the alteration status
of genes recorded in the data. The model is defined by:
. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Statistical analyses
Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze categorical
features such as the association of NOTCH1 or PIK3CA
mutations with clinical and pathological features, the
distribution of gene mutations in different clusters or
different cohorts, and the response rate to chemotherapy
among the subgroups. A P value of <0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant. Comparisons of binary and
categorical patient characteristics between subgroups
were performed using the chi-square test with Bonferroni
correction. A P value of <0.025 was considered to be
statistically significant.
The OS and progression-free survival (PFS)
distributions were described by the Kaplan-Meier curves,
and statistical significance was calculated using the logrank test. OS was evaluated from the time of diagnosis to
death or the final follow-up. Censored cases were defined
as patients who lost contact during the follow-up and who
were still alive at the end of the study. PFS was evaluated
from the time of diagnosis to the occurrence of cancerrelated death or emergence of recurrent tumors or the last
follow-up. Censored cases were defined as patients who
were still alive and had no recurrent tumors at the end
of the study. The primary outcome was clinical benefit,
which was defined as failure or response to chemotherapy.
The occurrence of cancer-related death or the emergence
of recurrent tumors in patients who had received standard
chemotherapy was considered to represent failure of
chemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses with
the Cox proportional hazards model were used to examine
the association between mutations and overall survival
and response to chemotherapy. For multivariate analysis,
in addition to the confounders with univariate P values
of < 0.05, traditional prognostic factors, including age,
smoking, drinking, clinical stage, tumor differentiation,
and chemotherapy treatment, were adjusted for the
analysis of the prognosis.

Mutually exclusive pattern
The mutual exclusivity pattern was detected
as described previously [14]. Briefly, n columns
correspond to NOTCH1 and PIK3CA mutations and
m rows correspond to patients whose tumor samples
were collected (with m n). For each patient and gene,
the dataset records a binary alteration status of the gene

NOTCH1 knockdown and its mutant overexpression

MTT assay
4×103 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and
incubated in normal condition for 24 hours. Cells were
treated with 100μl of 5mg/ml of MTT (Invitrogen)
solution for 4 hours at 37°C until crystals were formed.
MTT solution was removed from each well and 100μl of
DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the crystals.
Color intensity was measured by Microplate Reader
(Bio-Rad) at 490 nm. Each experiment consisted of four
replications and at least three independent experiments
were carried out.

Lentivirus vector pLKO.1-puro and its
packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 were
obtained from Addgene. NOTCH1 knockdown
experiments were performed in two ESCC lines
with high endogenous NOTCH1 expression:
KYSE150 and KYSE140. Two independent shRNAs,
(5’-UCGCAUUGACCAUUCAAACUGGUGG-3’,
Scrambled
siRNA
5’-AAAUGUGUGUACGUCUCCUCC-3’; NOTCH1
or nontargeting ON-TARGET plus SMART siRNAs,
Dharmacon RNATechnologies), were cloned into pLKO.1puro vector as described previously [10]. Infection of
retrovirus containing both siRNAs resulted in similar
phenotype changes in the pre-experiments (data not
shown). Thus, in order to obtain high infection efficiency,
we pooled these two independent siRNAs retrovirus to
infect KYSE cells. A non-specific targeting shRNA was
also cloned into pLKO.1-puro vector using as scrambled
control. Relative expression of NOTCH1 was normalized
to GAPDH expression level. For overexpression
experiments, NOTCH1 wild-type and NOTCH1-W745X
mutant were cloned into pLV-EGFP(2A)-puro-GFPvector and validated by sequencing. For overexpression
experiments, we used pLV-EGFP(2A)-puro-GFP-vector
as a control. NOTCH1-depleted KYSE cells were infected
with viruses as previously described [10]. 24 hours post
infection, cells were subjected for subsequent experiments.

Migration/invasion assay
Migration and invasion assays were performed in
16-well CIM plates in an xCELLigence RTCA DP system
(ACEA Biosciences) using matrigel basement membrane
matrix (BD) for real-time cell migration analysis as
described previously [10]. Briefly, 30,000 cells per well
were seeded as 5 duplicates in serum-free medium at
the upper compartment of the CIM plates coated with
or without matrigel. Serum-complemented medium was
added to the lower compartment of the chamber, and then
started measurement in xCELLigence RTCA DP system
and analyzed the CI (Cell Index) curves to determine cell
invasion activity. For negative controls, we added serumfree medium at both upper and bottom chambers. The
concentration of matrigel was 1:6 for KYSE150 cells and
1:10 for KYSE140 cells. The cell index representing the
amount of migrated cells was calculated with the RTCA
Software from ACEA Biosciences (San Diego, CA). At
least three independent experiments were carried out; for
each independent experiment, 5 duplicates were performed
for each group.

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed for 30 min in Triton buffer (1%
Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl,
1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM
PMSF, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium
betaglycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/mL leupeptin and 10 μg/
mL aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
15,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min, and protein concentrations
were determined using the Bradford method. Fifty
μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P
membranes. Proteins were detected by using anti-Nterminal NOTCH1 antibody (GENWAY Biotech Inc).
Antibody binding was detected using horseradish
peroxidase-labelled anti-mouse (Sigma) or anti-rabbit
(Cell Signaling) antibodies and chemiluminescence was
detected using a LAS4000 device (Fuji). Equal protein
loading was confirmed with antibodies against GAPDH
(Transgen).
