BACKGROUND. The authors reported previously the beneficial effects of interferon
(IFN)-a/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination therapy for patients with advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have tumor thrombi in the major portal
branches. In this report, the authors describe the results from IFN/5-FU chemotherapy for patients who underwent palliative hepatic resection for advanced
HCC with tumor thrombus in the main trunk of the portal vein and multiple
nodules in the whole liver. In addition, they evaluated the correlation between
the response to such therapy and expression of IFN-a type 2 receptor (IFNAR2).
METHODS. From October 1999 to December 2004, 30 patients with advanced
HCC, tumor thrombi in the main trunk of the portal vein, and multiple nodules
in the whole liver (Vp4 and grade 3 intrahepatic metastases) were recruited for

this study. They underwent palliative hepatic resection followed by at least
2 courses of IFN/5-FU. IFNAR2 expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS. No major treatment-related complications were noted. An objective
response was noted in 10 patients (33.3%) and included a complete response in
6 patients (20%), a partial response in 4 patients (13.3%), no response in 1 patient
(3.3%), and progressive disease in 19 patients (63.4%). IFNAR2 expression was
detected in 20 of 30 patients (66.7%). There was a significant difference in overall
survival between patients with positive and negative IFNAR2 expression cases
(P < .0025), and a significant correlation was observed between IFNAR2 expression and response to IFN/5-FU combination therapy (P 5 .0199).

CONCLUSIONS. Adjunct IFN/5-FU therapy is a promising modality for patients

poor despite aggressive surgery.4,5 In such a situation,
conventional therapies generally have no clinical effect
on HCC associated with portal vein tumor thrombi
(PVTT) because of poor efficacy and possible complications.6,7 Arterial infusion chemotherapy also has
been attempted, but its effectiveness still is unsatisfactory.9,10 Therefore, a new strategy is required for
patients who have intractable HCC and tumor thrombi
in the major branch of the portal vein.
Several recent studies have indicated the beneficial effects of interferon (IFN)-a-based combination
chemotherapies for HCC10–15 despite the lack of
satisfactory results from IFN-a monotherapy.16 We
also reported on the clinical efficiency of IFN-a
and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination therapy for
advanced HCC with PVTT and intrahepatic metastasis.17–20 IFN-a suppresses the proliferation of all type
I IFN receptor type 2 (IFNAR2)-positive cancer cell
lines in vitro, an effect that is mediated through its
high affinity to IFNAR2. Studies from our laboratories
demonstrated that IFNAR2 expression in HCC tissues
may be a useful predictor of response to IFN/5-FU
combination therapy.19
The current study was an extension to our previous work,18–20 in which we examined the clinical
effects of the combination therapy of subcutaneous
IFN-a and arterial infusion of 5-FU after palliative
hepatic resection in 30 patients who had HCC associated with Vp4 and multiple intrahepatic metastases
(IM3). We also investigated the correlation between
response to this therapy and expression of IFNAR2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Selection Criteria
The current investigation was a single-arm, openlabel study that was based on our previous
reports.18–20 Between October 1999 and December
2004, 30 patients with advanced HCC were enrolled.
All patients had radiologically confirmed tumor
thrombi in the main trunk of the portal vein (Vp4)
and IM3. The diagnosis was based on liver function
tests, serum a-fetoprotein (AFP), serum protein
induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II
(PIVKA-II), and imaging techniques, which included
computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hepatic angiography, and arterial portography. Consequently, these 30 patients
underwent palliative reduction surgery with tumor
thrombectomy in the main trunk of the portal vein
to reduce tumor volume and to reopen the portal
blood flow. IFN-a and 5-FU combination therapy for
remnant multiple hepatomas was carried out after
surgery. We used the following eligibility criteria

for the selection of patients. 1) absence of extrahepatic metastases, 2) granulocyte count > 2500/lL
or < 12,000/lL, 3) erythrocyte count > 8.0 g/dL, 4)
platelet count > 83104/lL, 5) glutamic oxaloacetic
and pyruvic transaminase levels < 100 IU/L, 6) total
bilirubin < 1.4 g/dL, 7) blood urea nitrogen < 30 mg/
dL, 8) serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL, 9) successful
implantation of intra-arterial catheter and drug delivery system, and 10) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status from 0 to 2.21
These eligibility criteria were based on our previous
studies.18,19 All patients signed informed consent
documents that were approved by the Institutional
Review Board attesting that they were aware of the
investigational nature of the study and were willing
to try the combination therapy.

Treatment Protocol of IFN/5-FU Combination Therapy
In each of 30 patients, an intra-arterial catheter was
inserted through the gastroduodenal artery during surgery or through the subclavian or femoral artery with
a subcutaneously implanted drug-delivery system.22
Each patient received subcutaneous IFN-a (OIF;
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company, Tokushima, Japan)
and an intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU (Kyowa Hakko
Company, Tokyo, Japan). One cycle of treatment consisted of 4 weeks. IFN-a (5 3 106 U [5 MU]) was
administered subcutaneously on Days 1, 3, and 5
of each week, resulting in a total dose of 60 MU per
cycle. Continuous infusion chemotherapy (5-FU,
300 mg/m2 per day) through the proper hepatic artery
was administered in the first and second weeks
through a catheter connected to a subcutaneously
implanted drug-delivery system. A 2- or 3-week rest period (cessation of drug therapy) separated the treatment
cycles. All anticancer therapies were discontinued when
adverse effects reached level 2 of the ECOG classification21 (with the exception of platelet and leukocyte
counts < 40,000/mm3 and < 2000/mm3, respectively, because these parameters often were low
before treatment because of associated cirrhosis).18
Evaluation of Response to IFN/5-FU Combination Therapy
A pretreatment evaluation was conducted at the commencement of the IFN-a/5-FU protocol, and a
posttreatment evaluation was conducted after the
completion of 2 cycles of treatment, almost 3 months
later. The evaluation included CT or MRI studies and
an assessment of changes in serum tumor markers,
such as AFP and PIVKA-II. All patients had their results
compared at these 2 time points for the evaluation of
antitumor effects. The objective response was classified according to ECOG criteria.21 A complete response
(CR) was defined as normalization of tumor marker

levels and disappearance of all tumors and portal vein
thrombosis on CT and/or MRI studies. A partial
response (PR) was defined as a decrease in tumor
marker levels and a decrease between 50% and 99% in
2-dimensional tumor measurement. No change (NC)
represented a decrease < 50% or an increase < 25%
in tumor measurements, and progressive disease
(PD) represented an increase > 25%. In addition, we
evaluated progression-free and overall survival rates.
Follow-up was from 15 to 75 months.

Reagents and Immunohistochemistry
Rabbit polyclonal antihuman IFNAR2 antibody
(OCT4813; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company) and its
blocking peptide were prepared according to the report
by Novick et al.23 The expression of IFNAR2 was examined in all 30 resected tumor samples by immunohistochemistry, which was carried out according to the
method described previously by investigators in our laboratories.19,24–26 All slides were interpreted by 1 of 2
investigators (H.W. or H.O.) in a blinded manner without
knowledge of the clinical or pathologic parameters.
Statistical Analysis
The Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxon univariate test was used
to examine the possible correlations between the effect
of therapy (CR/PR vs NC/PD), Child-Pugh score, serum
AFP, serum PIVKA-II, Okuda score, Cancer of the Liver
Italian Program (CLIP) score,3 and the expression of
IFNAR2. Survival curves were constructed using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in distribution
between groups were compared using the chi-square
test, and differences in mean values were calculated
with the Student t test. All data were expressed as the
mean  standard error of the mean (SEM). A P
value < .05 denoted a statistically significant difference.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The preoperative clinical characteristics of the participating patients are summarized in Table 1. The
median age of patients was 56 years (range, 29–71
years). AFP and/or PIVKA-II expression levels were
abnormal in all 30 patients. Preoperative liver function tests (mean  SEM values) were as follows; serum albumin, 3.6  0.4 g/dL; serum total bilirubin,
1.0  0.1 mg/dL; prothrombin time, 71.7%  12.3%;
hepaplastin test, 75.4%  16.2%; and indocyanine
green retention rate at 15 minutes, 18.5%  11.0%.
Clinical Response to Combination Therapy
Table 2 summarizes the operative procedure, postoperative pathologic diagnosis, and clinical response

2495

to IFN/5-FU combination therapy. All patients completed at least 2 cycles of IFN/5-FU combination
therapy after palliative surgery. For patients who had a
clinical response, we continued this combination therapy; whereas, for patients who had no response, we
stopped treatment after the completion of the second
cycle because of extensive progression of HCC.
At the start of IFN/5-FU treatment, all 30
patients had multiple intrahepatic lesions in the residual liver after palliative resection. The average and
median tumor size of the largest nodule were 16 mm
and 15 mm, respectively (n 5 30 patients; range, 10–
32 mm), as detected on CT or MRI studies. With
regard to the clinical effect, 10 patients (33.3%) had
an objective response, 6 patients (20%) had a CR,
4 patients (13.3%) had a PR, 1 patient (3.3%) had NC,
and 19 patients (63.3%) had PD. With respect to the
time to disease progression, the median progressionfree survival was 2 months, and the 1-, 2-, and
3-year progression-free survival rates were 20%, 16%,
and 0%, respectively. Furthermore, the median overall survival was 9.5 months, and the 1-, 2-, and
3-year survival rates were 40%, 28.5% and 21.4%,
respectively. The median progression-free survival for
patients who had a response (CR/PR; n 5 10
patients) was 17.5 months, and the median progression-free survival of patients who had NC/PD
(n 5 20 patients) was 2 months. The 1-, 2-, and
3-year progression-free survival rates of patients who
had CR/PR were 60%, 48%, and 0%, respectively; and
all 3 rates were 0% for the patients who had NC/PD.
The tumor burden generally was very small because
of the excision of the main tumor by reduction surgery. However, there was no correlation between
antitumor effect and tumor size in the remnant liver.
The median survival was 29 months for patients
who achieved a CR/PR (n 5 10 patients) and
6 months for patients who had NC/PD (n 5 20
patients). The median follow-up of the patients who
survived was 32 months. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates for patients who achieved a CR/PR were
100%, 77.8%, and 58.3%, respectively; and the rates
for patients who had NC/PD were 10%, 0%, and 0%,
respectively. The time to progression and overall survival curves are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. There were significant differences in the time
to progression and overall survival between responders (CR/PR) and nonresponders (NC/PD; P < .0001).

Adverse Effects
None of our patients developed side effects related
to catheter insertion or subcutaneous implantation
of the drug-delivery system. Grade 1 leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia, or myelosuppression was ob-

served in 8 patients, but none of those episodes
forced the termination of therapy or required treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.
Other adverse effects, including stomatitis or diarrhea, were mostly grade 1 and clinically manageable
in general. Fever was observed commonly but was
controlled easily by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs before IFN injection. No depression because of
IFN administration was observed in any of the 30
patients.

Correlation Between IFNAR2 Immunostaining
Pattern and Prognosis
For each tissue section, the intensity of IFNAR2 immunostaining was scored on a scale from 0 to 2, in
which 0 represented no or faint immunostaining, 1
represented moderate staining, and 2 indicated

strong staining, based on our previous reports.19,24,25
Table 2 shows the IFNAR2 expression level in each of
the 30 patients. IFNAR2 expression was noted in 10
of 30 patients (33.3%). The median progression-free
survival rate was 8 months for IFNAR2-positive
patients and 2 months for IFNAR2-negative patients.
The time to progression survival rates at 1, 2, and
3 years for IFNAR2-positive patients (n 5 20
patients) were 30%, 24%, and 0%, respectively, and
were significantly higher than the respective rates for
IFNAR2-negative patients (n 5 10 patients; 0% for all
3 rates; P 5 .0038) (Fig. 3A). The median overall survival rate was 16 months for IFNAR2-positive
patients and 5.5 months for IFNAR2-negative
patients. The overall survival rates at 1 year, 2 years,
and 3 years among IFNAR2-positive patients (n 5 20
patients; 60%, 42.8%, and 32.1%, respectively) were

DISCUSSION
Clinical and Pathologic Correlations
Finally, we compared the responders (CR/PR; n 5 10
patients) with the nonresponders (NC/PD; n 5 20
patients) in terms of serum AFP (within normal
range; < 5 ng/mL), serum PIVKA-II (normal range;
< 45 mAU/mL), Child-Pugh scores, Okuda scores,
CLIP scores, and IFNAR2 expression in univariate
analysis (Table 3). Serum AFP, PIVKA-II, Child-Pugh
scores, Okuda scores, and CLIP scores did not correlate with the response to combination therapy. Conversely, IFNAR2 expression correlated significantly
with the response to IFN/5-FU combination therapy
(P 5 .0199). Thus, the expression level of IFNAR2 was

With regard to the patient selection criteria followed
in the current study27 and in our previous investigations,18–20 we considered the presence of 3 types of
advanced HCC with PVTT in the main trunk for the
analysis of tumor progression (Fig. 3). The 3 types
were defined as follows: type I, PVTT with multiple
nodules in the bilateral lobes; type II, PVTT with a
huge mass in 1 lobe and no intrahepatic metastatic
nodules in the other lobe; and type III, PVTT with a
huge mass in 1 lobe and multiple intrahepatic metastatic nodules in the other lobe. Patients with type I
PVTT received IFN/5-FU combination treatment: An
antitumor effect was noted in 43.7% of patients, and

a significant survival benefit was noted in 55 patients
from our previous study.19 Patients with type II PVTT
underwent hepatic surgery to remove the huge mass
followed by IFN/5-FU combination treatment as a
postoperative adjunct. In this series, 100% survival
rate at 1 year was achieved in 15 patients.20 The
patients in the current study had type III PVTT,
which is considered the most advanced stage of
HCC. In such patients, the main trunk of the portal
vein already is packed with PVTT, and they have
rapid worsening to liver failure because of the
decrease in portal blood flow. These patients are
prone to rupture of esophageal varices because of
increased portal venous pressure. In general, most
patients with advanced HCC can be treated only
with best supportive care. However, for selected
patients with type III PVTT who have liver function
good enough to endure hepatic lobectomy, a multimodal treatment that includes surgery may be possible. Consequently, the 30 patients in the current

study underwent palliative reduction surgery, which
consisted of bisegmentectomy or trisegmentectomy
with extirpation of PVTT to reduce tumor volume
and to reopen the portal blood flow. IFN/5-FU combination therapy for remnant multiple hepatomas in
the residual liver was carried out after surgery. With
regard to these 30 patients, none developed any
major complications, and they started the IFN/5-FU
combination therapy from 3 to 5 weeks after surgery.
We also demonstrated the beneficial effects of IFN/5FU combination therapy in our patients. The efficacy
of such treatment was 33.3% in our patients with
highly advanced HCC. Thus, the combination treatment with IFN-a and 5-FU after hepatic palliative
surgery had a marked antitumor effect with an
encouraging response rate. Furthermore, the clinical
response translated into survival benefits, as shown
in Figures 1 and 2.
It should be noted, however, that the remaining 20
of 30 patients (66.7%) in our study did not respond to
the combination therapy. Among the 20 nonresponders,
there was only 1 patient with NC despite the mostly chemoresistant disease. We believe that this finding may be
attributed as follows: The HCC in this series was far
advanced, and HCC progression was extremely rapid
and aggressive despite palliative reduction surgery.
Under such conditions, almost all nonresponders died
within 12 months; 12 of 20 patients (60.0%) died within
6 months. For nonresponders to this treatment, however, the survival was too short to allow the receipt of
another treatment modality. Therefore, accurate prediction of chemosensitivity is desirable not only to prevent
the loss of a limited chance for another possible treatment but also to avoid potentially serious side effects.
However, currently, there are no suitable markers with
which to distinguish between patients who are likely
and patients who are unlikely to respond to this combination chemotherapy.
Several mechanisms for the anticancer effects of
IFN-a, with or without 5-FU, have been proposed.28–37

We demonstrated previously that IFN-a and 5-FU
synergistically inhibited tumor cell proliferation with
cell cycle arrest38 and induced apoptosis by regulating
apoptosis-related molecules.39 We also reported that
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing
ligand, its receptor pathway,40 and Fas and the Fasligand pathway41 partially contributed to the antitumor effects of IFN-a and 5-FU combination therapy.
Moreover, IFN-a suppressed proliferation in all type I
IFNAR2-positive HCC cell lines in vitro through
mechanisms related to apoptosis or cell cycle inhibition.42 The importance of IFNAR2 expression for the
anticancer effect of IFN/5-FU was highlighted in a
similar situation in our previous report.38,39,43 These
findings suggest that the antineoplastic effects of IFNa are likely to be mediated through its high-affinity

membrane type I receptor, IFNAR2.44 In this regard,
we postulated that IFNAR2 expression in HCC tissues
may be a useful predictor with which to distinguish
between potential responders and nonresponders to
IFN/5-FU combination therapy. On the basis of these
results, we investigated the correlation between
IFNAR2 expression and the effect of IFN/5-FU combination therapy using immunohistochemical analysis,
and the results showed a good correlation.
Several markers for the prediction of tumor recurrence and prognosis have been identified for
patients with HCC. Levy and Sherman45 reported
that the CLIP classification for HCC is easier to
implement and more accurate than the Okuda classification. In addition, Koike et al.46 suggested that the
serum PIVKA-II level is the most useful clinical parameter for predicting the development of portal
vein invasion. To investigate the applicability of these
clinical parameters, AFP, PIVKA-II, Okuda scores, and
CLIP scores were used in the current study to assess
the clinical effects of IFN/5-FU combination therapy.
The results indicated that expression of IFNAR2 was
the only significant predictor of clinical outcome of
IFN/5-FU combination therapy; and our survival
analysis indicated a significant role of IFNAR2
expression on prognosis. These results suggest that
the expression of IFNAR2 may be a potentially useful
predictor of response to IFN/5-FU combination therapy. In our recent report using microarray analysis,
several genes involved in IFN signaling transduction
were identified as useful for molecular prediction of
response to IFN/5-FU combination therapy.47
In conclusion, the current study has demonstrated the efficacy of IFN/5-FU combination therapy
after surgery for patients with advanced HCC who
have tumor thrombi in major branches of the portal
vein. The results also indicated that the clinical
response to such therapy is correlated significantly
with the expression of IFNAR2 in patients with HCC.
