Decreases Tumor Growth

Abstract
Primary cilia are multisensory organelles recently found to be absent in some tumor cells, but the
mechanisms of deciliation and the role of cilia in tumor biology remain unclear. Cholangiocytes, the epithelial
cells lining the biliary tree, normally express primary cilia and their interaction with bile components
regulates multiple processes, including proliferation and transport. Using cholangiocarcinoma as a model, we
found that primary cilia are reduced in cholangiocarcinoma by a mechanism involving histone deacetylase 6
(HDAC6). The experimental deciliation of normal cholangiocyte cells increased the proliferation rate and
induced anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, deciliation induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Hedgehog signaling, two important pathways involved in cholangiocarcinoma
development. We found that HDAC6 is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma and overexpression of HDAC6
in normal cholangiocytes induced deciliation and increased both proliferation and anchorage-independent
growth. To evaluate the effect of cilia restoration on tumor cells, we targeted HDAC6 by short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) or by the pharmacologic inhibitor, tubastatin-A. Both approaches restored the expression of primary
cilia in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and decreased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth.
The effects of tubastatin-A were abolished when cholangiocarcinoma cells were rendered unable to
regenerate cilia by stable transfection of IFT88-shRNA. Finally, inhibition of HDAC6 by tubastatin-A also
induced a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor growth in a cholangiocarcinoma animal model. Our data support a
key role for primary cilia in malignant transformation, provide a plausible mechanism for their involvement,
and suggest that restoration of primary cilia in tumor cells by HDAC6 targeting may be a potential
therapeutic approach for cholangiocarcinoma. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2259–70. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that function
as multisensors of the extracellular environment (1). Interest in
primary cilia has increased markedly over the last 15 years, as it
was observed that mutations in genes required for the assembly and/or the sensory properties of cilia result in diverse
human disorders such as visceral epithelial hyperplasia, polycystic kidneys, pancreas, and liver among other abnormalities
(2). Recent observations also suggest a relationship between
ciliary structure/function and tumorigenesis. For example,
Aurora A kinase mediates ciliary disassembly and is over-

expressed in many epithelial cancers (3). Nek8, a kinase
expressed in primary cilia that regulates ciliogenesis, is increased in breast cancer (2, 4); and the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) tumor suppressor gene inhibits ciliogenesis and is
associated with renal cancers (5, 6). Also, mutations in mice
of Tg737, the mammalian homolog of Chlamydomonas IFT88,
a key component for ciliary formation (7), accelerate the
rate at which chemical carcinogens induce liver neoplasms
(8). Finally, very recent ﬁndings showed reduced expression
of cilia in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (2), renal cancer
(6), astrocytoma/glioblastoma (9), and breast cancer (10).
While these data suggest that ciliary dysfunction may be associated with cancer development, the mechanisms leading
to ciliary reduction in tumor cells as well as the consequences of such a loss remain poorly understood and are the subject
of the present manuscript.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignancy thought to be
derived from cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells lining the
biliary tree. Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly aggressive tumor
whose incidence has been increasing worldwide over the past 2
decades, now accounting for 10% to 15% of all hepatobiliary
malignancies. Advanced cholangiocarcinoma has a devastating prognosis, with a median survival of less than 24 months
(11, 12).

Cholangiocytes normally express primary cilia extending
from their apical plasma membrane into the ductal lumen.
In cholangiocytes, the primary cilium functions as a multisensor of the extracellular milieu detecting a wide variety
of chemical and physical stimuli. Indeed, we reported that
cholangiocyte primary cilia are mechano-, chemo-, and osmosensory organelles (13–16).
In the present manuscript, we describe that ciliary expression is decreased in cholangiocarcinoma by a mechanism
involving overexpression of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).
We found that targeting HDAC6 in cholangiocarcinoma cells
decreases the tumorigenic phenotype of the cells in a ciliary reexpression–dependent manner in vitro and in an animal model
of cholangiocarcinoma. The data not only shed light on the
mechanisms by which ciliary disassembly facilitate malignant
transformation but also identify a potential molecular target
for cholangiocarcinoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
The normal human cholangiocytes (H69 and NHC) and the
normal rat (NRC) cell lines were maintained as previously
described (13, 17, 18). The human cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines [HuCCT-1 (ref. 19) and KMCH (ref. 20)] and the rat
cholangiocarcinoma cell line (BDEneu; refs. 21, 22) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagles' Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin, and 100 mg/L insulin.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
and synthesized into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR
for HDAC6 was carried out using 1 mL of cDNA and the Light
Cycler Fast Start DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green I kit (Roche
Diagnostics) as previously described (23). The primers used
were HDAC6 sense (50 -AGTCTTATGGATGGCTATTGCATG30 ), HDAC6 antisense (50 -TGGACCAGTTAGAGGCCTTCAGG30 ), PTCH1 sense (50 -CGCTGTCTTCCTTCTGAACC-30 ), and
PTCH1 antisense (50 - ATCAGCACTCCCAGCAGAGT-30 ). IFT88
expression was analyzed using the TaqMan Gene Expression
Assay (Assay ID Hs00197926_m1) from Applied Biosystems
following the manufacturer's directions. The samples were
normalized to 18S rRNA.
Immunﬂuorescences
Liver sections were incubated with antibodies against acetylated a-tubulin (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich), IFT88 (1:100, Proteintech), CK19 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Abcam),
g-tubulin (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich), proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA; 1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and/or
HDAC6 (1:100, Abcam) overnight at 4 C followed by incubation
for 1 hour with ﬂuorescent secondary antibodies (1:100). Nuclei
were stained with 40 ,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Prolong
Gold w/DAPI, Invitrogen). For HDAC6-ﬂag expression analysis, cells were transfected with the Addgene plasmid 13823
(Dr. Eric Verdin; ref. 24) using Fugene reagent (Roche). After 3

days of incubation in media without serum, cells were ﬁxed
and stained for ciliary markers acetylated a-tubulin and/or
IFT88 and ciliated cells were analyzed under the confocal
microscopy.
Scanning electron microscopy
Cells were processed as previously described (25).
Chemical and molecular deciliation
Chemical deciliation was carried out by treatment with 4
mmol/L chloral hydrate as previously described (15). Molecular deciliation was obtained by stably transfection with ift88,
Kif3a, or Cep164 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids (Supplementary Table S1).
Proliferation assays
Proliferation assays were conducted using the CellTiter 96
AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS; Promega) and/or counting cells using the Cellometer Auto4
(Nexcelom Bioscience) cell counter.
Anchorage-independent growth
Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by growing
cells in soft agar. About 25,000 cells suspended in 0.4% agar in
culture media were layered over a 1% agar layer in a 6-well
plate. Media were added twice a week and pictures were taken
after 14 to 21 days of incubation. The number and size of
colonies were analyzed using the Gel-Pro software.
Invasion assays
Invasion assays were conducted using the CytoSelect 24Well Cell Invasion Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) following the
manufacturer's directions.
Western blots
Protein fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, blots
were incubated overnight at 4 C with one of the following
antibodies: HDAC6 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Erk
(1:2,000, Abcam), p-Erk (1:1,000, BD Biosciences), Gli1 (1:500,
Abcam), IFT88 (1:1,000, Proteintech), Kif3a (1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Cep164 (1:500, Genetex), IL-6 (1:500,
Santa Cruz), bcl-2 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz), actin (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich or Abcam), and acetylated-a-tubulin (1:5,000,
Sigma-Aldrich); washed and incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
(1:5,000, Invitrogen) or IRdye 680 or 800 (1:15,000, Odyssey)
corresponding secondary antibody. For protein detection,
ECL system or Odyssey Liquor Scanner was used, and the
Gel-Pro Analyzer 6.0 software was used for densitometric
analysis.
In vivo experiments
All animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. In vivo cell transplantation was carried
out in adult ﬁsher 344 male rats (Harlan) with initial mean
body weights ranging between 200 and 250 g, as previously

The Role of Cilia in Cholangiocarcinoma

cholangiocarcinoma and 6 normal controls with the ciliary
markers, acetylated a-tubulin and/or IFT88, and the cholangiocyte marker, CK19. We found that while 100% of bile
ducts from normal controls show primary cilia, only 20% are
ciliated in cholangiocarcinoma samples (Fig. 1A–E). We
found a similar situation when we stained a commercially
available cholangiocarcinoma tissue array [AccuMax Array
A205(II); Supplementary Fig. S1]. To further explore the
differential expression of primary cilia, we assessed their
expression on 2 normal human cholangiocyte cell lines (H69,
NHC) and the cholangiocarcinoma cell lines Hucct-1 and
KMCH. Ciliary expression was induced by serum starvation
(15) and assessed by staining with acetylated a-tubulin,
IFT88, and the centrosome marker, g-tubulin; our results
showed that only 3% (Hucct-1) and 1.8% (KMCH) of the
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines express cilia, whereas in the
normal cell lines, cilia were found in 67% (H69) and 61%
(NHC) of the cells, respectively (Fig. 1F–H). Finally, to
conﬁrm ciliary loss in cholangiocarcinoma cells, we

described (21, 26, 27). Five days after tumor implantation,
animals were treated daily with tubastatin-A (10 mg/kg body
weight intraperitoneally) or vehicle for 7 days. After treatment, animals were euthanized and the livers were removed
for analysis.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  SE. Statistical analyses were
conducted by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test to
compare more than 2 groups and by the Student t test to
compare 2 groups. Results were considered statistically different at P < 0.05.

Results

Deciliation of normal cholangiocytes induces
proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and
invasion
To explore the potential relationship between ciliary loss
and cholangiocyte phenotype, we assessed the effect of
deciliation on normal human (i.e., H69) and rat (NRC)
cholangiocyte cell lines. First, we induced chemical deciliation by ClHy treatment (15); deciliation by this manipulation
increased normal cholangiocyte proliferation by 2-fold
(Fig. 2A). We complemented this approach of chemical
deciliation by molecular deciliation using speciﬁc shRNAs
against IFT88, Kif3a, or Cep164 (Supplementary Fig. S2); this
approach caused an increase in cell proliferation by 1.89-,
1.77-, and 1.63-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B). The increased

proliferation was conﬁrmed by nucleotide incorporation
assays (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, cell-cycle analysis showed an increase in G2–M and a decrease in G1–G0
phases in IFT88-shRNA deciliated cells compared with normal NT-shRNA controls (Supplementary Fig. S4), further
supporting increased proliferation. To further characterize
the effect of ciliary loss, we assessed anchorage-independent
growth and invasion and found that deciliation by IFT88
shRNAs induced both parameters by 6- and 3-fold, respectively, and by 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively, when deciliation
was induced by Kif3a shRNAs (Fig. 2C and D). Finally,
we analyzed the status of the hedgehog signaling pathway
by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) of patched mRNA and Western
blots for Gli1, interleukin (IL)-6, and Bcl2; and the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway by
Western blotting and found that deciliation induced activation of both hedgehog and MAPK signaling pathways

(Fig. 2E and F, Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these
data suggest that experimentally induced deciliation stimulates a phenotypic transformation of normal cholangiocytes
in culture to a malignant phenotype.
HDAC6 is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma and
decreases ciliary expression
To explore the potential mechanisms involved in the cholangiocarcinoma decreased ciliary expression, we analyzed
HDAC6, a tubulin deacetylase reported to induce ciliary
resorption in the immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cell
line hTERT-RPE1 (3); moreover, evidence in the literature
suggests an important role for HDAC6 overexpression in
tumorigenesis (28–31). We assessed the expression of HDAC6
by Western blot analysis on 2 different cholangiocarcinoma
cell lines (Hucct-1 and KMCH) and found increased expression in both (on average, 100%) of HDAC6 compared with
normal cultured cholangiocytes (H69). Overexpression of
HDAC6 correlated with the decreased amount of its target,
acetylated a-tubulin (Fig. 3A), supporting the validity of
our analyses. The mRNA level was analyzed by qRT-PCR and
no signiﬁcant differences were found (Fig. 3B), suggesting a
posttranscriptional regulatory pathway. Using confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy, we also observed that HDAC6
was overexpressed in liver specimens from 10 patients with
cholangiocarcinoma compared with 11 normals (Fig. 3C).
We found a similar situation when we stained the commercially available cholangiocarcinoma tissue array [AccuMax
Array A205(II); Supplementary Fig. S5].
To assess the role of HDAC6 overexpression in cholangiocyte ciliary loss, we transfected NHC cells with a HDAC6-ﬂag
expression vector. Confocal immunoﬂuorescences using anti-

www.aacrjournals.org

ﬂag and HDAC6 antibodies showed the expression of the
HDAC6-ﬂag construct (Fig. 4A). As predicted, when the cells
were co-stained with the ciliary markers, acetylated-a-tubulin
and IFT88, the cells that were positive for the ﬂag epitope
showed reduced cilia expression compared with the surrounding nontransfected cells (Fig. 4B). After stable transfected cells
were obtained by antibiotic selection, Western blot analysis
showed the overexpression of HDAC6 in the stably transfected cells using anti-ﬂag antibodies (Fig. 4C). In addition to the
decreased ciliary expression (Fig. 4D), these cells showed
an increased proliferation rate (1.7-fold; Fig. 4E), increased
anchorage-independent growth (1.5-fold; Fig. 4F), and decreased protein levels of acetylated-a-tubulin compared
with empty vector–transfected cells (Fig. 4G). Taken together,
these results suggest that the overexpression of HDAC6
in normal cholangiocytes correlates with the reduction of
primary cilia expression and the acquisition of a malignantlike phenotype.
Targeting HDAC6 induces ciliary restoration and
reverses the malignant phenotype of
cholangiocarcinoma cells
As HDAC6 overexpression seems to contribute importantly
to cholangiocarcinoma ciliary loss, we inhibited HDAC6 expression by speciﬁc shRNAs (Fig. 5A) or with the HDAC6
inhibitor, tubastatin-A (32). These approaches both induced
an increase in acetylated-a-tubulin levels and the restoration
of primary cilia expression in the cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines (3.3- and 18-fold, respectively; Fig. 5A, D, and E); and
the restoration of primary cilia correlated with downregulated Hedgehog (Hh) and MAPK signaling pathways (Fig.
5C), as well as decreased cell proliferation rates (decreased in

cilia, the proliferation rates and anchorage-independent
growth rates were not signiﬁcantly different from the vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 6A and B), showing that the ability of cells
to undergo ciliogenesis is essential for the effects of tubastatinA. These data are consistent with a critical role of HDAC6 in
reduced ciliogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma cells and provide
further support for a relationship between the absence of cilia
and a malignant phenotype.
HADC6 inhibition by tubastatin-A treatment reduces
tumor growth and induces ciliogenesis in vivo
On the basis of the in vitro activity of tubastatin-A on
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, we tested the effect of this
drug using a recently developed syngeneic rat orthotopic
model of cholangiocarcinoma (21, 26, 27). Tumors were
removed after treatment with tubastatin-A or vehicle for
7 days. The mean tumor weights in animals treated with
tubastatin-A was 6-fold lower than vehicle-treated controls
(0.33  0.09 vs. 1.81  0.51 g, P < 0.05), and the ratios of
tumor weight to liver weight and body weight were also
signiﬁcantly reduced (5- and 5.6-fold, respectively) by tubastatin-A treatment (Fig. 7A–D). Furthermore, confocal immu-

Discussion
The key ﬁndings reported here relate to the potential role
of primary cilia in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma.
Our data show that (i) the expression of primary cilia is
decreased in cholangiocarcinoma in vivo and in vitro; (ii)
chemical or molecular deciliation of normal cholangiocytes
induces a malignant phenotype characterized by increased
proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, invasion and
activation of Hh and MAPK signaling pathways; (iii) HDAC6
is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma in vivo and in vitro;
(iv) molecular overexpression of HDAC6 causes decreased
ciliogenesis and induces proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in normal cholangiocytes (i.e., a malignant phenotype); (v) molecular downregulation of HDAC6 or its pharmacological inhibition by tubastatin-A induces restoration
of primary cilia in cholangiocarcinoma cells and reduces
cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and invasion
in a ciliary-dependent manner, and (vi) the HDAC6 inhibitor,
tubastatin-A, reduces tumor growth in a cholangiocarcinoma animal model. The data are consistent with an important role for HDAC6 and primary cilia in the pathogenesis of
cholangiocarcinoma.
Recently, 4 different tumors were described to be devoid
of primary cilia. In pancreatic cancer cells, the absence of
cilia is independent of ongoing proliferation and ciliogenesis
can be reversed by inhibiting Kras pathways (2). These ﬁndings
are consistent with our results, as HDAC6 is activated by Kras
and the incidence of Kras mutations in cholangiocarcinoma
is estimated to be 54% to 67% (3, 33). The absence of primary
cilia has also been reported in sporadic clear cell renal carcinoma; in this case, ciliary loss is mediated by dysfunction of
the protein of the vHL tumor suppressor gene, pVHL (6).
pVHL binds and stabilizes microtubules by protecting them
from depolymerization, which is a prerequisite for ciliogenesis (6). Interestingly, pVHL inactivation induces HEF1 and
AuroraA (34), and these events lead to HDAC6 activation and
ciliary resorption (3). Aberrant ciliogenesis is also found in
cells derived from astrocytomas/glioblastomas; it has been
proposed that this deﬁciency likely contributes to the phenotype of these malignant cells (9). Finally, primary cilia are
decreased in breast cancer as well, by unknown mechanisms
(10). Taken together, our results and these previous studies
suggest that the loss of primary cilia is a common feature in
many epithelial tumors. However, our studies are the ﬁrst to
show the reduction of cilia and the overexpression of HDAC6
in cholangiocarcinoma. Moreover, our data are ﬁrst to show

Figure 7. Effect of tubastatin-A on cholangiocarcinoma growth in vivo. The effect of tubastatin-A was tested on an orthotopic, syngeneic CCA model in rats.
A, livers were removed after 7 days of treatment and tumors were dissected. Tumor weights, tumor/liver weight, and tumor/body weight ratios were
calculated and compared (B–D). Tumor sections were stained with the ciliary marker acetylated-a-tubulin in red and the cholangiocyte marker CK-7 in green
(E) or with the proliferation marker PCNA in green (F); nuclei were stained in blue with DAPI. The amount of ciliated and PCNA-positive cells per ﬁeld were
quantiﬁed (G, H).  , P < 0.05, n ¼ 5 for controls and n ¼ 6 for tubastatin-A.

that restoration of primary cilia by targeting HDAC6 is a
potential therapeutic approach for cholangiocarcinoma and
perhaps other tumors characterized by defective ciliogenesis.
On the other hand, the situation is different in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma; these tumors are mainly
ciliated and cilia are required for the growth of tumors bearing
an activation mutation at the level of smoothened (ciliarydependent activator of the Hh signaling pathway). In contrast,

www.aacrjournals.org

if the tumors have an activation mutation of the downstream
effector of the pathway, the transcription factor Gli2, primary
cilia play a similar role as described in the present work, that
is, inhibition of tumor development (35, 36). In cholangiocarcinoma, consistent with our results, the aberrant activation
of Gli transcription factors has been described (37, 38).
HDAC6 is a unique member of the histone deacetylase
family because, unlike other histone deacetylases, it does not

interact with histones (i.e., inhibition of HDAC6 inhibits deacetylation of a-tubulin without affecting histone acetylation;
ref. 39). HDAC6 not only deacetylates a-tubulin but also
cortactin, Hsp90, and the redox regulatory proteins, PrxI and
II (40). Moreover, HDAC6 has been identiﬁed as a key regulator
of many processes that are linked to cancer (e.g., cell survival,
motility, and metastasis), making it an attractive therapeutic
target (39). On the basis of our results, it appears that the
antitumorigenic effect of HDAC6 inhibition in cholangiocarcinoma mainly depends on ciliary restoration, as KMCH cells
stably transfected with ift88 shRNA did not respond to tubastatin-A treatment. We acknowledge that the involvement of
the other targets of HDAC6 cannot be conﬁdently excluded.
Previous work with embryonic kidney cells, mammary epithelial cells, mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts, and ovarian and
cancer cell lines showed that HDAC6 is not only important for
Ras- or ErbB2-dependent oncogenic transformation of primary
cells but also is required for maintaining the anchorage-independent growth of established cancer cell lines (28). The exact
molecular mechanisms mediating such a tumor-promoting
effect remains unknown. Our results in cholangiocarcinoma
cells suggest that HDAC6 mediates the oncogenic-induced
loss of primary cilia and the subsequent derepression of
tumorigenic signaling pathways such as Hh and MAPK. The
mechanisms by which HDAC6 is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma remain to be elucidated. As we found alterations
in protein but not in mRNA levels for HDAC6, posttranslational
regulations (e.g., HCAC6 turnover rates, the downregulation
of microRNAs potentially targeting HDAC6 mRNA, etc.), are
possibilities.
Hedgehog and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)1/
2 pathways are both activated in cholangiocarcinoma (37,
38, 41), and the dual targeting of these pathways coordinately
decrease proliferation and survival of cholangiocarcinoma
cells (41). IL6 and bcl-2, both targets of hedgehog signaling
(42–44), are also activated in cholangiocarcinoma (45, 46).
Our results show that the experimental deciliation of normal
cholangiocytes induced the activation of both hedgehog
and MAPK pathways, consistent with the concept that cilia
normally act as a negative regulator of these pathways in
cholangiocytes. Importantly, our results also show that the
restoration of primary cilia, by targeting HDAC6 in cholangiocarcinoma cells, decreases Hh and MAPK signaling pathways.
Michaud and Yoder speculated that genes and proteins
involved in the structure or function of primary cilia may
represent new targets for small-molecule inhibitors, siRNAs,

or antibody therapeutics (47). On the basis of our data, we
would extend this concept by suggesting that restoration
of primary cilia and their complex multisensory signals by
HDAC6 targeting could act as a tumor suppressor mechanism. Indeed, the rapidly evolving ﬁeld of HDAC inhibitors
promises to generate very potent and speciﬁc HDAC6 inhibitors, like tubastatin-A (32) and the more recently developed
ACY-1215 (48). The fact that mice lacking HDAC6 are viable
and develop normally (49) suggests that HDAC6-speciﬁc
targeting may have minimal adverse effects. Furthermore,
our in vivo experiments on a rat cholangiocarcinoma model
using tubastatin-A showed a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor
growth associated with an increased ciliary expression, suggesting that the restoration of primary cilia in tumor cells by
means of HDAC6 inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic
approach for cholangiocarcinoma.
