ABSTRACT
Current therapy for BCL-2-associated tumors such as Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
(NHL) is inadequate. The DNAi PNT2258, a 24 base single-stranded phosphodiester
DNA oligodeoxynucleotide (PNT100) encapsulated in a protective liposome, was
precisely designed to treat cancers that over-express BCL-2. PNT2258 strongly
inhibited BCL-2 promoter activity, confirming its predicted mechanism of action. BCL-2
mRNA and protein expression were significantly downregulated in a follicular small
cleaved cell lymphoma (WSU-FSCCL) cell line. 2.5μM PNT2258 induced an initial Sphase arrest followed by a gradual increase in the sub-G0 (apoptosis) compartment
and a reciprocal progressive decrease of the S phase. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase (TdT)-positive populations and cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were also
increased. The data are consistent with the idea that BCL-2 inhibition by PNT2258
activates apoptotic pathways in WSU-FSCCL cells. This is the first report to address
the distinct mechanism of action underlying the anti-BCL-2 functions of PNT2258.
Growth inhibition in two other cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and WSU-WM, supports broad
applicability of BCL-2 DNAi to treatment of B-cell NHL.

[8–10]. The translocation, a cytogenetic hallmark of FL, is
seen in 80%-90% of cases [11, 12] and in 30% of cases of
DLBCL [13, 14]. 10% of FL tumors lack the translocation
and do not express BCL-2 protein: this is common in
grade 3b, which is dominated by centroblasts [15, 16].
To date, most methods aimed at interfering with the
anti-apoptotic effects of BCL-2 have relied on inhibition
via small molecules such as ABT-199 or on decreasing
expression at the RNA level via RNAi [17–26]. In
this article, we describe a novel approach, the use of a
specific oligonucleotide to block transcription by DNA
interference (DNAi) [27].
We recently reported on the development,
physiochemical characterization and activity of the DNAi,
PNT2258 [28]. PNT2258, a 24 base-single stranded,
unmodified phosphodiester DNA oligonucleotide (PNT100)
encapsulated in specialized liposomes (SMARTICLES®),
was designed to target an untranslated region of BCL-2 to
block transcription. The drug exhibited broad antitumor

INTRODUCTION
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the 7th most
common cancer in the US [1], with 530,919 reported
cases [2]. 71,850 new cases (39,850 males and 32,000
females) were predicted for 2015 [3]. NHL is a group
of heterogeneous diseases resulting from malignant
transformation of lymphoid cells with different molecular
pathogeneses [4]. 90% of NHLs involve B cells; of
these, 30% are characterized as aggressive and 20% as
indolent [5]. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
representative of aggressive NHLs, is often curable but
follicular lymphoma (FL), the prototype indolent NHL,
remains difficult to treat [6, 7].
BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), a key regulator of
apoptosis first cloned from a human B-cell lymphoma,
is expressed in a number of hematologic malignancies
and solid tumors. BCL-2 is overexpressed in both FL and
DLBCL, mostly as a result of a t(14;18) translocation

activity in vitro and in xenograft models [28]. PNT2258
was shown to be safe and well-tolerated at doses of up
to150 mg/m2 in a phase I study [29] and to have activity in
patients with relapsed or refractory NHL in a pilot phase II
study [30]. We hypothesized that PNT2258 inhibits BCL-2
via direct inhibition of transcription, although it may affect
promoter or transcription factor binding. BCL-2 contributes
to the genesis of lymphomas, is critical for cancer cell
survival, and promotes chemo-resistance [31]. Current
chemotherapeutic treatment options are non-specific and
cause significant off-target toxicity. Specific targeting
of the BCL-2 family of proteins offers the opportunity
to minimize off-target effects and control apoptotic and
survival pathways directly.
In the current study, we used three lymphoma cell
lines with distinct genetic characteristics, WSU-FSCCL
(follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma; t(14;18) BCL-2
and t(8;11) c-myc rearrangements), WSU-DLCL2 (diffuse
large cell lymphoma; t(14;18) BCL-2 rearrangement) and
WSU-WM (Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia; t(8;14)
c-MYC rearrangement), to investigate the mechanism of
action of PNT2258 and its role as a DNAi. Our results
show that the down regulation of BCL-2 mRNA and
protein expression following PNT2258 exposure triggers
cell death pathways in FSCCL cells. We conclude that
DNAi is a novel gene-silencing strategy that could be
applied to therapeutic targeting of a variety of genes
important to different types of cancer.

no anti-proliferative effects [28]. RT-PCR (Figure 1B)
and Western blot (Figure 1C, 1D) analysis revealed that
BCL-2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly
decreased from 48 h through 72 h after exposure to 2.5μM
PNT2258. Since BCL-2 is known to prevent apoptosis,
we investigated whether PNT2258 treatment induced
apoptosis in these cells and in two other lymphoma cell
lines with different BCL-2 expression characteristics.

RESULTS

PNT2258 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis

PNT2258 represses the BCL-2 promoter

To determine whether PNT2258 induced cell death
through on-target intrinsic apoptosis, WSU-FSCCL
cells exposed to 2.5μM PNT2258 for up to 96 h were
analyzed by flow cytometry. The S-phase population was
increased (from 46% to 54%; Figure 3A and 3G) and the
proportion of cells in G2-M was reduced (from 16% to
7%; Figure 3A and 3H) at 24 h. There was a reciprocal
increase in the sub-G0 compartment (apoptosis) and G0/
G1 (resting cells) starting at 48 h (Figure 3B and 3E)
with a progressive increase in sub-G0 (from 3% to 35%;
Figure 3C and 3E) and G0/G1 (from 34% to 55%; Figure
3C, 3D and 3F) at 72 and 96 h. There was a significant
decrease in S-phase cells (from 56% to 28%; Figure
3D and 3G) at 96 h compared with control. The results
are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. PNT2258
induces: 1) apoptosis, and 2) cell cycle arrest at G0/
G1 (growth inhibition), indicating an effect on the G0/
G1 checkpoint. Since current anti-BCL-2 drugs usually
cause apoptosis without affecting the cell cycle, our
results suggest that PNT2258 may control the cell cycle
via non-BCL-2 mechanisms.
Further examination of the PNT2258 effect on
apoptotic cell death in WSU-FSCCL demonstrated that,
at the lowest concentration used (2.5uM), PNT2258
elicited the formation of the distinct morphologic features

PNT2258 decreases lymphoma cell viability
We treated three lymphoma cell lines, two with
t (14;18) and BCL-2 rearrangements (WSU-FSCCL
and WSU-DLCL2) and one (WSU-WM) lacking these
rearrangements, with different concentrations (2.5μM,
5.0μM, and 10μM) of PNT2258. Each of the cell lines
expressed BCL-2 at baseline (Supplementary Figure
S1). Cell viability was decreased in a dose dependent
manner: growth inhibition between 2.5μM and 10 μM was
statistically significant in all three cell lines at 48h-96h,
but differences between 2.5 μM and 5 μM and 5 μM and
10 μM were variable. Cell viability was significantly lower
in WSU-FSCCL cells at 24h. As predicted, NHL cell
lines with the (14;18) translocation were more sensitive
to PNT2258 than the cell line without these alterations
(Figure 2A-2C). We chose to continue our investigations
in the cell line with the greatest response, WSU-FSCCL
(Figure 2A; p ≤ 0.0001).

The DNAi sequences used here, complementary to
the template strand of the DNA, were originally screened
against the ENCODE database to ensure that the targeted
areas did not encode mRNA or microRNA. The 25 mer
PNT100 sequence of PNT2258 is complementary to a
segment of the consensus sequence recognized by the Sp1
transcription factor in the BCL-2 P1 promoter. We first
sought to determine whether a putative 2638-bp (-3934
to-1287) region in the BCL-2 promoter (P1) confers
PNT2258 responsiveness by transiently transfecting
K562 cells with a plasmid containing the BCL-2 promoter
construct before treatment with or without PNT2258 for
48 h. As shown in Figure 1A, PNT2258 strongly downregulated BCL-2 promoter activity.

PNT2258 down-regulates BCL-2 protein and
mRNA expression in WSU-FSCCL cells
We next examined whether PNT2258 inhibits BCL2 expression in WSU-FSCCL cells. In this study, we
compared PNT2258-treated and non-treated cells as we
previously reported that three PNT2258 control sequences
(scrambled, mismatched and reverse complement) had

of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, nuclear chromatin
condensation, and formation of membrane blebs and
pyknotic bodies after 72h of treatment (data not shown).
TUNEL assays show an increase in the FITC-TdT-positive
population in PNT2258 treated cells compared with control
(horizontal axis) (Figure 4A). Total FITC positive cells
also increased with increasing time of incubation, from
20% at 48h to 40% at 72h (Figure 4B). Moreover, there
was a progressive shift-to-the-right of the FITC positive
cell population with increasing incubation time indicating
increasing frequency of DNA breaks (apoptosis). Most of
the FITC positive cells were in the sub-G0 phase; however,
there were also positive cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M.
Induction of apoptosis was confirmed independently using
AnnexinV staining as shown in Figure 4C and 4D.

our PNT2258-treated WSU-FSCCL cells. Protein levels
of Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S were decreased (Supplementary
Figure S2A, S2B, S2C) but expression of Bcl-xL, Bax,
Bak, Bid, and p53, remained unchanged (Supplementary
Figure S2A and S2C). However, there was activation of
the apoptosis executioner (caspase-3) and induction of
both caspase-3 and PARP cleavage (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C)
as well as a reduction of Cytochrome C (Figure 5A and
5D), supporting flow cytometry data (Figures 3 and 4) that
2.5μM PNT2258 induces significant apoptosis.

BCL-2 overexpression represses PNT2258induced cell death
To document that PNT2258 induces cell death via
downregulation of BCL-2, K562 cells were transfected
with a pcDNA3 expression vector containing BCL-2
cDNA or the control empty vector before treatment with
PNT228. Cell viability, assessed by Trypan blue, was
significantly lower in PNT2258-treated cells transfected
with the empty vector at 96 hr but not in those expressing
BCL-2 (Supplementary Figure S3).

PNT2258 increases cleaved caspase-3, and
cleaved PARP and decreases Mcl-1 and
cytochrome C protein levels
We then assessed expression of several BCL-2
family members and selected markers of apoptosis in

DISCUSSION

It is noteworthy that PNT2258 induced its
therapeutic effects on lymphoma cells at concentrations
achievable in patients. A 2.5 μM concentration of PNT2258
translates to 17.6 μg/mL (mol. weight of PNT2258 is
7221g/mol). According to the pharmacokinetic analysis
conducted as part of the phase I clinical trial, a maximum
plasma concentration of 29.222 μg/mL (cycle 1 day 1) and
42.125 μg/mL (cycle 1 day5) were achieved at a dose of
113 mg/ m2 [30]. The selected safe dose utilized in phase
II trial was 120mg/m2.
BCL-2 is a logical target for the treatment of NHL
and has been the focus of significant drug development
efforts. Our group has developed and evaluated different
anti-BCL-2 strategies including small molecule inhibitors
(SMIs) [20, 42–45] and anti-sense oligonucleotides [23,
27]. RNAi often requires large doses and continuous
exposure for effective suppression of gene function. SMI
toxicity varies by type: pan BCL-2 homology domain 3
(BH3) mimetics (AT-101) tend to be more toxic, causing
dose-dependent thrombocytopenia [17, 46, 47], selective

DNA interference (DNAi) sequences are designed to
target regions upstream of the ATG start site of genes that
cause disease. These regions lie within CG-rich areas and,
by design, coincide with (or are near) consensus motifs
recognized by transcription factors or other cis-regulatory
acting elements. Gene transcription is inhibited when
sufficient DNAi molecules are available. The PNT100
sequence used for this study specifically targets a region
recognized to be regulatory for BCL-2 that is translocated
with (14;18) chromosomal rearrangement [28]. The results
presented above indicate that PNT2258, a prototype
DNAi, is most effective at decreasing cell viability in
BCL-2 expressing lymphoma cell lines with the t(14;18)
translocation. PNT2258 induced cell cycle arrest and
increased apoptosis. BCL-2 expression was significantly
inhibited at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting
that this decrease in BCL-2 expression is responsible for
PNT2258-induced apoptosis.

BCL-2 BH3 mimetics, although platelet sparing, induce
resistance and increase the risk of tumor lysis syndrome
[17, 48, 49]. Side effects and host toxicity may limit the
ability to deliver effective dosages of all these treatment
regimens. These limitations can be overcome if one can
target a gene of interest at the DNA level.
PNT2258 has shown great promise in preclinical and
pilot phase II clinical evaluations (28, 30). The DNAi was
designed to target the non-coding, non-transcribed regions
5’ upstream of the ATG start site in the BCL-2 promoter.
Disruption of Sp1 results in transcriptional inhibition
of BCL-2 [50]. Sp1 binds to double-stranded DNA and
recognizes the consensus sequence 5’- G/T (GGGCGG)
G/AA -3’, and, coincidentally, a complementary sequence
within PNT100 (28). The DNAi sequence used here
is unique and 100% homologous to the CpG region of
BCL-2. Off-target binding to other Sp1 sites, and/or

genomic DNA or RNA is unlikely. Our results confirm
that the region between 1506 bp and 1737 bp of the BCL2 promoter confers PNT2258 responsiveness. BCL-2
overexpression protected K562 cells from PNT2258induced cell death. The fact that BCL-2 mRNA and
protein expression were also inhibited support a DNAi
mechanism of action.
The mechanisms of action of this new DNAi
are just beginning to be understood [51]. Induction
of apoptosis by PNT2258 in WSU-FSCCL cells is
predominantly the result of its actions on BCL-2
expression. Its additional effects on cell cycle arrest
suggest PNT2258 may have secondary targets as BCL2 is not involved in cell cycle arrest. It is conceivable
that DNAi oligonucleotides may bind to other BCL-2
family proteins. In our hands, only Mcl-1 protein levels
were lower in PNT2258-treated cells. However, we

believe that this decrease is secondary to the cell cycle
changes induced by PNT2258 as Mcl-1 down-regulation
was recently shown to be associated with apoptosis and
G1/S transition [52]. The possibility that PNT2258 may
target both intended (BCL-2) and unintended genes, thus
enhancing its effectiveness, remains to be investigated
further.
Although some lymphomas can be competently
treated with a combination of chemotherapy and

immunotherapy, many patients eventually become
refractory to these treatments and ultimately succumb to
their disease. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study showing the selective induction of apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest in lymphoma cells treated with PNT2258,
suggesting potential translational application of PNT2258
as a safe treatment for NHL, including recurrent disease.
DNAi oligonucleotides may prove to be an essential tool
for future therapeutic intervention, particularly in cancer.

Equal amounts of protein lysates were subjected to SDSPAGE followed by blotting with the indicated antibodies
and detection by Western Super Signal West Pico
Chemiluminescent substrate reagents (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA). Select images were quantified using
ImageJ densitometry software (Version 1.45, US National
Institutes of Health) and normalized to the actin signal.
Data are presented as relative band signal intensity
compared to control.

Cell culture
The cell lines used in this study (WSU-FSCCL,
WSU-DLCL2, and WSU-WM), established at Wayne
State University (WSU) [32–34] and EBV (Epstein-Barr
virus) negative were cultured as previously described
[35]. Molecular characterization, translocations and
breakpoints, of each cell line have been published [32].
Human K562 cells were maintained according to a
standard protocol (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis

Transient transfections and luciferase assays

RNA was extracted from PNT2258 treated and
untreated control lymphoma cells using the miRNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Total RNA was
quantified by NanoDrop and 1μg of each sample was
reverse-transcribed using the SuperScriptW VILOTM
cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). The BCL-2
and RPLPO genes were used for detection of gene
amplification and normalization of each sample. Reverse
transcription and PCR were performed using the qRT-PCR
Primer Set (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). PCR product
amplification was detected by the level of fluorescence
emitted by SYBR Green I master (Roche, Pleasanton, CA,
USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Reactions
were carried out in a 384 well microtiter plate using the
LightCyclerW 480 System (Roche). Three independent
experiments were performed in triplicate and each
reaction was repeated at least once to ensure accuracy.
The PCR cycle number at threshold (Ct) was used for
the comparison. Gene expression at baseline and post
treatment was quantified by qRT-PCR relative to RPLPO
using the ΔΔCt method and expressed as fold change
of gene expression relative to that in untreated control
[37]. Values represent mean ± SE of three independent
experiments performed in triplicate.

Constructs containing the P1 promoter (LB124:
−3934 to −1287) in Bluescript were purchased from
Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The P1 promoter construct
was obtained by digesting LB124 with SpeI and HindIII
and inserting the P1 promoter region into NheI (which has
SpeI-compatible overhangs)/HindIII restricted pGL3-Basic
(Promega, Madison, WI) that contains the reporter firefly
luciferase gene. All transfections were carried out in 24
well-plates, Thermo Scientific, (Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly,
plasmids (1 μg BCL-2 promoter construct, 0.1 μg Renilla
luciferase-expressing reporter vector pRL-Null (Promega;
Madison, WI), were introduced into < 50% confluent
cells with Lipofectamine® LTX transfection reagent (Life
Technologies; Grand Island, NY). Cells were lysed 48 h
later, and promoter activity analyzed in a MicroLumat Plus
LB96V (Berthold Technologies) using the Dual Luciferase®
Reporter Assay System (Promega). The firefly luciferase
values were normalized to those of Renilla luciferase; all
transfections were repeated at least three times.

Antibodies and reagents
The following antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA): BCL-2
(2876, 1:1000), Caspase-3 (9662, 1:1000) and PARP
(9532, 1:1000). The following antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA):
Cytochrome C (7H8: sc-13560, 1:1000), Bcl-xL (H-5: sc8392, 1:500), Mcl-1 (S-19: sc-819, 1:1000), Bax (N-20:
sc-493, 1:500), Bak (G-23: sc-832, 1:500), Bid (FL-195:
sc-11423, 1:1000), p53 (DO-1: sc-126, 1:500), and the
actin antibody (ACTN05, 1:2000) from Thermo Scientific,
(Rockford, IL, USA). Protein concentrations were
determined using the Micro bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
protein assay (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL,
USA). PNT2258 and associated reagents were provided
by ProNAi Therapeutics (Ann Arbor, MI).

Growth inhibition by trypan blue
Treated and control cells were seeded at a density of
0.2x106 viable cells/ml per well in a 24-well plate (Costar,
Cambridge, MA, USA) and treated with PNT2258 (at 2.5,
5, and 10 μM) for variable periods of time. The number
of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion
(Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) at 24 hour
intervals [38].

Cell cycle analysis
PNT2258-treated and control cells were collected
and centrifuged twice in cold PBS. Cells were then fixed
in 5 ml of 70% ethanol and stored at 4oC overnight [38,
39]. For analysis, cells were centrifuged and resuspended
in 1 ml of staining buffer containing 50ug/ml propidium

The DNA content was then analyzed on a Coulter EPICS
753 flow cytometer and the different stages of the cell
cycle were determined using a ModFit 5.2 computer
program. The flow cytometry work was done at the
Microscopy, Imaging and Cytometry Resources Core at
Wayne State University.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptotic cell death was determined using Annexin
V-FITC staining and TUNEL assay (Bio-Vision Mountain
View, CA). The Annexin V-FITC studies were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions but the
protocol for ApoDIRECT (TUNEL assay) was slightly
modified as previously published by our lab [38]. In
brief, the fluorescein-labeled DNA was detected by flow
cytometry. PI staining was simultaneously used to separate
cells into G0/G1, S, G2/ M, and sub-G0 compartments
based on DNA content. Since dUTP-positive cells are
considered apoptotic, dual staining with dUTP and PI
allowed us to assign dUTP-positive cells to a specific
phase of the cell cycle [40]. The percentage of apoptotic
cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis of the
sub-G0/G1 DNA population in cell-cycle histograms as
described in detail elsewhere [38].

Transfections and rescue experiment
The BCL-2 expression vector used in the study has
been previously described [41]. The BCL-2 and control
empty vectors (pcDNA3) were transfected into K562 cells
at a density of 0.2×106 viable cells/ml per well in a 24-well
plate. 24hrs after transfection, cells were treated with 10
μM PNT2258 for variable periods of time. The number of
viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion (Sigma
Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) at 24 hour intervals [38].

Data analysis and statistical significance

Statistical analyses were performed by one-way
ANOVA using PRISM. ImageJ densitometry software
(Version 1.45, US National Institutes of Health) was
used for quantification of Western blot bands. Selected
bands were quantified based on their relative integrated
intensities, calculated as the product of the selected pixel
area and the mean gray value for those pixels normalized
to the internal control. Fold increase or decrease was
calculated by standardizing each treatment as a ratio to
the control. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 for
all data comparisons.
