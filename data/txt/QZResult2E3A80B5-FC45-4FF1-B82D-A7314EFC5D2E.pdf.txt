Abstract
The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for
intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. This
system controls a wide range of cellular regulatory proteins,
including transcription factors and cell cycle regulatory
proteins. Recent evidence also established the importance of
the proteasome in tumor development, showing antitumor
and antiangiogenic actions by using selective inhibitors
in vivo. As signaling via the vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway is critical for angiogenic
responses to occur, we explored whether antiangiogenic
effects due to proteasome inhibition were partly mediated
through decreased endothelial VEGFR2 expression. This study
shows that different proteasome inhibitors blocked VEGFR2
expression in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent
manner. This blockade was paralleled by the respective
inhibition of the formation of capillary-like structures and
endothelial cell migration. In contrast, neither tie-2 nor
VEGFR1 expression was significantly affected by proteasome
inhibitor treatment. The suppressive effects on VEGFR2
expression were not conveyed by increased shedding or a
decrease in protein half-life, suggesting that transcriptional
mechanisms accounted for the observed effects. In line with
this conclusion, proteasome inhibition significantly suppressed VEGFR2 mRNA accumulation. In addition, inhibitor
treatment considerably decreased the transcriptional activity
of 5¶ deletional VEGFR2 promoter gene constructs. Proteasome inhibition–mediated repression was controlled by a
GC-rich region that harbored one consensus Sp1-binding site.
Subsequent EMSA analyses showed decreased constitutive
Sp1-dependent DNA binding in response to proteasome
inhibition. In addition, we could show that proteasome
inhibitors reduced VEGFR2 mRNA stability. Therefore,
VEGFR2 expression may constitute a critical molecular target
of proteasome inhibitors that may mediate their antiangiogenic effects in vivo. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1976–84]

as well as during angiogenic sprouting in inflammatory diseases,
cancer, and wound repair (1, 2). The VEGF family members are
secreted glycoproteins that mediate vascular permeability, endothelial cell proliferation, and migration and act as critical survival
factors for endothelial cells.
The biological effects of VEGF are primarily mediated through its
interaction with three structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases:
VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 (3, 4). VEGFR1
is a positive regulator of macrophage migration and was described
as a regulator of VEGFR2 signaling by mechanisms such as acting
as a decoy receptor (5). VEGFR2 is thought to mediate the major
growth effects and permeability associated with VEGF, whereas
VEGFR3 is essential for lymphatic vessel formation (5–7). Whereas
VEGFR2 is only detectable at relatively low levels in the adult
vasculature (8), it may be markedly up-regulated in blood vessels
during chronic inflammation, tumor growth, and wound repair
(4, 9). VEGF is secreted by various cell types; however, VEGFR2
expression is largely restricted to vascular endothelial cells.
Endothelial expression of VEGFR2 closely parallels VEGF expression in angiogenic responses (10). As a result, suppression of the
VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway is being intensely explored as a
therapeutic target to interfere with new blood vessel formation (11).
The proteasome is the main multisubunit protease in the
cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. It recognizes and rapidly degrades
ubiquitinated proteins involved in the regulation of transcription,
antigen presentation by HLA molecules, cell cycle progression,
apoptosis, signal transduction, and angiogenesis (12–15). Proteins
that undergo regulation by the proteasome include c-fos, p53,
HIF1-a, STATs, Bcl-2, PPAR-g, and the estrogen receptor (12, 15,
16). This plethora of proteasome regulatory targets shows the great
variety of cellular regulatory mechanisms that are controlled by the
ubiquitin/proteasome system. Tumor cells often depend on the
proteasome-mediated degradation of abnormal proteins, because
they frequently express aberrant cell cycle proteins or have
mutations at apoptotic checkpoints. Therefore, malignant cells
are much more sensitive to proteasome inhibition than normal
cells. Therefore, the proteasome is a novel and promising target for
cancer therapy (17–19).
Recent work has revealed that the proteasome is also involved in
angiogenesis. Oikawa and colleagues showed that the proteasome
inhibitor lactacystin effectively suppresses angiogenesis in vivo
(20). Mezquita and colleagues showed that the proteasome
inhibitor MG262 suppresses the expression of VEGFR1 in human
microvascular dermal neonatal endothelial cells, possibly contributing to the antiangiogenic effects of proteasome inhibitors (21).
Interestingly, Drexler and colleagues recently showed increased
apoptosis in human and bovine endothelial cells after the
administration of a proteasome inhibitor that could be abolished
using a caspase-3 inhibitor (22).

instructions. HUVECs were left untreated

MG132 (at 1 mmol/L) and ALLN (at
10 Amol/L). Columns, mean values from

As endothelial VEGFR2 expression is increasingly recognized
as a very important regulator of apoptosis in endothelial cells,
as well as a key component of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling
system during tumor angiogenesis, we hypothesized that
proteasome inhibitors may also control angiogenesis, at least in
part, by targeting VEGFR2 expression. To test this hypothesis,
human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated
with different proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin, MG132, and
ALLN).
Altogether, our results confirm that proteasome inhibitors
mediate their antiangiogenic effects partly by reducing VEGFR2
expression in human endothelial cells by interfering with the
transcriptional activity and the mRNA stability of this tyrosine
kinase receptor. These results highlight the important roles of
proteasome inhibitors in the regulation of angiogenesis, as well as
in the treatment of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HUVECs were purchased from PromoCell and cultured
until the fifth passage at 37jC and 5% CO2 in an endothelial cell growth
medium (Cambrex).
Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were prepared, as described
previously (23). The membranes were incubated with the indicated primary
antibodies [VEGFR1 (MAB321, clone49560), VEGFR2 (MAB3573,
clone89109), and tie-2 (MAB313, clone83711) from R&D Systems; Sp1
(clone PEP2) and flt-1 (clone H-225) from Santa Cruz; tubulin antibody from
LabVision], followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham; anti-goat,
Dako). The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham).
RNA extraction and reverse transcription–PCR. Reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were performed on total RNA (150 ng)

analyses for VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were performed with the one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen).
The PCR products were size-fractionated on 1% to 2% agarose gels and
visualized on a UV transilluminator. The densitometry of bands was
quantified using the public domain Java image processing program, ImageJ
(v1.29s); the absorbencies (A) of the KDR bands were corrected for loading
differences based on the corresponding GAPDH bands. The primer set for
VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and GAPDH used for PCR were recently described
elsewhere (24).
Transient transfection and analysis of reporter gene expression.
HUVECs (1.0  105 per well, 12-well plates) were transfected with 0.5 Ag of
the appropriate firefly luciferase construct and 0.1 Ag phRG-TK vector
(Promega) using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Human
VEGFR2 reporter gene constructs were generously provided by Dr. C.
Patterson (University of North Carolina). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the control transfectants were left untreated and the test transfectants
were exposed to proteasome inhibitors for 24 h. The luciferase activities were
measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega.
Preparation of nuclear extracts and gel mobility shift analysis.
HUVECs were left untreated or incubated with proteasome inhibitors for
30 min. The nuclear proteins were extracted, as described previously (23).
DNA binding reactions were performed with or without excess unlabeled
competitor [Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Promega)] and Sp1 and Sp3
antibodies (Santa Cruz).
Tube formation assay. Two-dimensional, short-term in vitro Matrigel
assays were carried out on HUVECs that were either left untreated (solvent
only, DMSO 0.1%) or incubated with either MG132 (at 1 Amol/L for 8 h) or
ALLN (at 10 Amol/L for 8 h), whereas cells were either stimulated with
VEGF (10 ng/mL) alone, VEGF and proteasome inhibitors simultaneously,

or proteasome inhibitors alone. The Matrigel itself did not contain any
growth factors or other supplements.
Migration assay. Migration of endothelial cells was assayed using a
modified Boyden chamber (BD Falcon 24-well assay plates, BD Biosciences)
with membranes with an 8-Am pore size (BD Falcon Individual HTS
FluoroBlok Cell Culture Inserts, BD Biosciences). HUVECs that were
suspended in the endothelial cell growth medium (Cambrex) containing
0.4% fetal bovine serum and either solvent or the respective proteasome
inhibitor were added to the upper chamber at a density of 1  105 per well.
Endothelial cell growth medium (Cambrex) containing VEGF (20 ng/mL)
was placed in the lower chamber, and the cells were allowed to migrate for
6 h. After incubation, the migrated cells attached to the lower face of the
membrane were visualized with Calcein-AM and counted both in highpower fields and with fluorimetric measurement (Cytofluor).
Small interfering RNA. All small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents,
including transfection reagents, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc. The VEGFR2 siRNA was used to knockdown VEGFR2 expression in
HUVECs. The transfection was done by using the Santa Cruz siRNA transfection reagent. Nontargeting siRNA was used as siRNA control. The experiments were carried out following the manufacturer’s standard procedures.
Statistical analysis. The data are expressed as means F SD/SE from
three or more independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed
using the Student’s t test.

Proteasome inhibitors suppress VEGFR2 protein expression
in human endothelial cells. To evaluate whether the antiangiogenic properties of proteasome inhibitors are mediated in part by

tubulin proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. VEGFR2 protein remaining at these time points was determined by densitometric scanning, the
results of which were normalized to amounts of tubulin. Comparable results were obtained from three independent experiments.

the reduction of VEGFR2 expression in HUVECs, respectively, the
expression of other important endothelial receptors as VEGFR1 or
tie-2, we studied the effects of the proteasome inhibitors
lactacystin, MG132, and ALLN on the protein expression of
VEGFR2 by Western blot analysis. These experiments revealed an
inhibition of basal VEGFR2 expression upon treatment with each
of the proteasome inhibitors in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, MG132 tended to induce the
expression of tie-2 in HUVECs, but only at higher concentrations.
In contrast, the expression of VEGFR1 was not influenced by any of
the proteasome inhibitors, thus providing evidence for a selective
mechanism of action (Fig. 1A and B). The use of additional
proteasome inhibitors as MG262 supported the suppression of
VEGFR2 (Supplementary Fig. S1).

For other surface receptors, such as the interleukin 6 (IL-6)
receptor or the tumor necrosis factor-a receptor, receptor shedding
has been shown to be an important mechanism of receptor
regulation. To determine whether such a mechanism mediated
VEGFR2 down-regulation in response to proteasome inhibitors,
we measured the levels of soluble VEGFR2 in the supernatants of
HUVECs after treatment with proteasome inhibitors for 24 hours.
The proportion of soluble VEGFR2 did not significantly differ from
nontreated endothelial cells (Fig. 1C).
Harada and colleagues convincingly showed that the expression
of the androgen receptor is partly regulated by the protein half-life
of the receptor (25). To rule out such a phenomenon for VEGFR2
during proteasome inhibitor treatment, we performed cycloheximide analysis (Fig. 2). These analyses revealed that there was only a

slight increase in the VEGFR2 protein half-life during treatment
with proteasome inhibitors.
Proteasome inhibitors suppress VEGFR2-mediated endothelial
cell function. To analyze whether proteasome-mediated VEGFR2
inhibition may regulate VEGFR2-dependent endothelial cell function, we studied the influence of ALLN and MG132 on the ability
of HUVECs to form capillary-like structures and their ability to
migrate.
VEGF-induced capillary-like structures formed by endothelial
cells were coincubated with ALLN, MG132, and lacatcystin and
analyzed 12 hours after seeding on Matrigel. Treatment with all of
the proteasome inhibitors significantly inhibited VEGF-induced, as
well as basal tube–like formation of, HUVECs on Matrigel (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the proteasome inhibitors
effectively compromise the migration capacity of endothelial cells
(Fig. 3B). These data suggest that proteasome inhibition has direct
effects upon endothelial cell capabilities, which are likely to involve
inhibition of VEGFR2 expression.
Proteasome inhibitors reduce VEGFR2 mRNA levels in
human endothelial cells. To determine whether inhibition of
VEGFR2 protein expression corresponds to a suppression of
steady-state mRNA levels, we analyzed the effects of proteasome
inhibitors on VEGFR2 transcript levels in HUVECs.
Consistent with our protein data, the various proteasome
inhibitors suppressed VEGFR2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4). To
determine whether posttranscriptional mechanisms account for
the inhibitory properties of proteasome inhibitors on VEGFR2
expression, we analyzed their effects on VEGFR2 mRNA
turnover.
mRNA half-life experiments using Actinomycin D revealed that
there was a significant reduction in the half-life of VEGFR2 mRNA
after treatment with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 5). Whereas a
reduced mRNA half-life can at least partly mediate the inhibitory
properties of proteasome inhibitors on mRNA steady-state

expression levels, there may be additional control of inhibition at
the transcriptional level.
Inhibition of VEGFR2 promoter activity in response to
proteasome inhibitors is mediated by a single Sp1-binding
site. To determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
observed reduction in VEGFR2 transcript levels after treatment
with proteasome inhibitors, a set of 5¶ deletional VEGFR2
promoter–based luciferase gene constructs was transiently transfected into HUVECs (Fig. 6A). Analysis of the expression of
luciferase in control and proteasome inhibitor–treated cells
revealed f60% suppression of basal activity of the 1.1 kb/+268
bp, 77/+268 bp, and 60/+268 bp VEGFR2 luciferase constructs
when compared with control cells. The luciferase expression of the
60/+268 bp M1 VEGFR2 luciferase construct that harbored a
mutation at the first Sp1 site at 58 bp displayed no significant
suppression when compared with the longer reporter plasmids.
Therefore, analysis of the mutant construct revealed a loss of
proteasome inhibitor–mediated reporter gene expression. Hence,
these data indicate that the repressive effects of proteasome
inhibitors on VEGFR2 expression occur not only at the posttranscriptional level but also at the transcriptional level via a
proximally located single Sp1 site.
Constitutive Sp1-dependent binding activity to the 85/ 31
bp VEGFR2 promoter sequence is reduced by proteasome
inhibitors. We then analyzed whether specific protein complexes
that interacted with the VEGFR2 promoter region that had been
shown to be important in our transcriptional activation studies
could be identified. We used a double-stranded DNA probe
corresponding to the 85/ 31 bp VEGFR2 promoter sequence in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and explored whether Spdependent binding to the promoter sequence might be influenced
by treatment with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 6B). During
incubation with nuclear extracts of untreated HUVECs, constitutive
DNA binding activity of distinct complexes was observed (lane 1).

Figure 4. VEGFR2 mRNA expression is inhibited by

extracted from subconfluent cell cultures were

or treated with lactacystin (1 Amol/L), MG132
(1 Amol/L), and ALLN (10 Amol/L) for the indicated
times. The RT-PCR bands were quantified by
densitometry; absorbencies of VEGFR2 bands were
corrected for loading differences based on the
corresponding GAPDH bands. Results were
confirmed in three independent sets of experiments.

Proteasome Inhibitors Suppress Angiogenesis via VEGFR2

Figure 5. VEGFR2 mRNA half-life is reduced
by proteasome inhibitors. HUVECs were
incubated in the presence or absence of
MG132 (1 Amol/L) or ALLN (10 Amol/L) for
1 h and incubated for 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, and
7.5 h with fresh medium containing
Actinomycin D (10 Ag/mL). Then RT-PCR
analyses for VEGFR2/GAPDH of total RNA
extracted from subconfluent cell cultures
were performed. The PCR products were
size-fractionated in 2% agarose gels,
respectively, and visualized on a UV
transilluminator. VEGFR2 mRNA remaining at
these time points was determined by
densitometric scanning, the results of which
were normalized to amounts of GAPDH mRNA.
Comparable results were obtained from three
independent experiments.

In lysates of cells treated with proteasome inhibitors, a significant
decrease in DNA binding activity was detected (lanes 2 and 3). The
addition of Sp1 and Sp3 antibody, as well as the combination of
both antibodies, led to the formation of more slowly migrating
complexes (lanes 6–8), thereby determining the specificity of the
bound complex. The binding specificity of the complexes was
determined by competition by adding excess unlabeled 85/ 31
bp wild-type DNA (lane 4). Excess unlabeled double-stranded Sp1
consensus oligonucleotides were also used to compete with the
complexes (lane 5), further supporting the assumption that nuclear
proteins bind to the 85/ 31 bp VEGFR2 promoter sequence in an
Sp1 site–exclusive manner.
To exclude the possibility that proteasome inhibitors influence
the expression of Sp1 and, therefore, block VEGFR2 expression, we
analyzed the levels of Sp1 protein expression after treatment with
distinct proteasome inhibitors. Only a slight increase in the basal
protein expression levels of the transcription factor Sp1 were
detected after treatment with the inhibitors (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Proteasome inhibitors have been viewed as rising stars in tumor
treatment over the past 10 years. These agents have already
become the standard of care for refractory multiple myeloma and
mantle cell lymphoma (26, 27). There are many tumor entities, such
as metastatic breast cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, and
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that have produced encouraging

www.aacrjournals.org

results in phases I and II studies using proteasome inhibitor
treatments (28, 29). Proteasome inhibitors have a number of
important mechanisms of action. One of the first mechanisms ever
described was the suppression of the nuclear factor-nB signaling
pathway via the stabilization of InB (30, 31). This phenomenon has
been credited with a plethora of antitumor effects, such as
apoptosis, antiangiogenesis, inhibition of cell invasion, chemosensitization, and inhibition of oncogenesis (17, 29). Further
research showed that, by interfering with the degradation of cell
cycle proteins, proteasome inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest,
whereas their ability to stabilize proapoptotic proteins like Bax or
p53 leads to the apoptosis of tumor cells (32–34).
Recently, it was shown that proteasome inhibitors do not only
have a pronounced effect against the tumor cell itself but also
mediate their therapeutic effects via antiangiogenic mechanisms.
Drexler and colleagues showed an increase of apoptosis in human
and bovine endothelial cells after the administration of a
proteasome inhibitor, which could be abolished by a caspase-3
inhibitor (22). In addition, Oikawa and colleagues showed that the
proteasome inhibitor lactacystin effectively suppressed angiogenesis in vivo (20). Roccaro and colleagues analyzed the influence of
brotezomib on VEGF and IL-6 secretion by multiple myeloma–
derived endothelial cells. Interestingly, this group showed an
effective suppression of the proangiogenic cytokines VEGF and
IL-6, thus offering the first explanation for the antiangiogenic
mechanisms underlying the treatment of multiple myeloma with
proteasome inhibitors (35).

Because endothelial VEGFR2 is an important regulator of
apoptosis in endothelial cells and VEGFR2 expression is increasingly recognized as a key component of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling
system during tumor angiogenesis, we hypothesized that proteasome inhibitors may also control angiogenesis, at least partly by
targeting VEGFR2 expression.
Here, we provide solid evidence that different proteasome
inhibitors down-regulate VEGFR2 expression by two distinct
mechanisms, thereby influencing VEGFR2 mRNA accumulation
in HUVECs. First, our data indicate that proteasome inhibitors
suppress VEGFR2 transcription via a single Sp1-binding site in the
proximal promoter located between 60 and 30 bp, thus
repressing Sp1-dependent DNA binding and transactivation. There
is growing evidence that the proteasome degradation system plays
a crucial role in the transcription of a variety of proteins by several
distinct mechanisms. These mechanisms include influencing
transcription factors, influencing transcription factor activators
or inhibitors, or even direct interactions between proteasome
components and the promoter, as shown by Morris and colleagues
for the CDC20 promoter (36, 37). Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed

transcription factor that is particularly important for the regulation
of TATA-less genes that encode housekeeping proteins. Most
growth factors and receptors are also encoded by such genes (38).
Thus far, there are only a few reports concerning the influence of
proteasome inhibitors on the transcription factor Sp1. Some
describe an increase in Sp1 half-life due to reduced degradation by
the blocked proteasome (39, 40). Others, including Santiago-Josefat
and Fernandez-Salguero, showed that treatment of mouse embryo
primary fibroblasts with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 leads to
a decrease in Sp1 protein expression, combined with an increase in
its phosphorylation and Sp1 binding to the dioxin receptor nuclear
translocator promoter (41). These results indicate the cell-specific
regulation of the transcription factor Sp1 by proteasome inhibitors.
This differential cellular responsiveness to proteasome inhibition
has been previously noted. Whereas proteasome inhibition induces
apoptosis in fast growing tumor cells, the opposite effect has been
noticed in differentiated cells (42, 43). In addition, there seems to
be a great variety in the sensitivity of different tumor cell lines to
proteasome inhibition (44). Hence, these characteristics of
proteasome inhibitors may explain the discrepancy between the

Proteasome Inhibitors Suppress Angiogenesis via VEGFR2

results of Mezquita and colleagues and our study. Mezquita and
colleagues showed that the proteasome inhibitor MG262 suppresses the expression of VEGFR1 in human microvascular dermal
neonatal endothelial cells. In addition, they could show that the
expression of VEGFR2 does not change upon exposure of the chick
vascular pectin oculi to MG262. In our study, we did not find that
any of the proteasome inhibitors (MG132, lactacystin, and ALLN)
tested influenced VEGFR1 expression. However, we showed an
effective down-regulation of VEGFR2 by these inhibitors, which
was supported by compatible promoter studies, as well as the
observation of a distinct decrease in the half-life of the VEGFR2
mRNA. In addition, the treatment of HUVECs by MG262 led to a
pronounced time-dependent and concentration-dependent downregulation of VEGFR2. Therefore, the results of Mezquita and
colleagues may be explained by the use of microvascular
endothelial cells and the pectin oculi of the chicken, which differ
from HUVECs or, for example, the use of another cell growth
medium (21).
In addition to the transcriptional control of VEGFR2 expression
by Sp1-dependent DNA binding and transactivation, we showed
that the half-life of VEGFR2 mRNA is significantly reduced after
drug treatment, whereas posttranslational mechanisms did not
seem to be involved. Thus, the decrease in mRNA stability may be
an additional means of regulation of VEGFR2 mRNA expression by
proteasome inhibitors. Recently, Meissner and colleagues could
show such a mechanism to be an important way of regulating
VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells treated with microtubuletargeted agents (24). It is becoming increasingly obvious that the
expression of various cellular proteins is not only regulated at the
transcriptional and posttranslational levels but also at the
posttranscriptional level. Recently, Kandasamy and Kraft convincingly showed that the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 induces

stabilization of the TRAIL receptor DR5 mRNA through its 3¶
untranslated region (UTR), possibly by inhibiting the proteasomal
degradation of the mRNA stabilization protein HuR (45). Paschoud
and colleagues produced similar results regarding the stability of
IL-6 mRNA, demonstrating an increase in IL-6 mRNA stability after
treatment with proteasome inhibitors that was possibly due to an
increase in the 3¶ UTR binding of AUF1 (46). These findings show
that proteasome inhibitors not only regulate mRNA expression at
the transcriptional level but also through regulation of mRNA
stability. Therefore, the available evidence supports our assumption
that proteasome inhibitors may indeed affect VEGFR2 mRNA
stability, thus closely linking the proteasome to VEGFR2 expression. Due to the important role of VEGFR2 in endothelial cell
function and tumor angiogenesis, VEGFR2 mRNA stability may
constitute an additional target of future antiangiogenic strategies.
In conclusion, our data identify VEGFR2 expression as an
additional target of proteasome inhibitors in endothelial cells. This
finding may provide an additional and important explanation for
the antiangiogenic action mediated by proteasome inhibitors and
is likely to improve the therapeutic potential and clinical
indications of proteasome inhibitors in vascular-dependent
diseases.
