ABSTRACT
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that is formed by the
phosphorylation of sphingosine and catalysed by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) or
sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2). Sphingosine kinases play a fundamental role in many
signaling pathways associated with cancer, suggesting that proteins belonging to this
signaling network represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the last years, many
improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for
relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential
of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor,
respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death
in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels
in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded
protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms
in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of
SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported
that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress
response of cells. These findings indicate that SK1 or SK2 represent potential targets
for treating T-ALL.

is implicated in many physiological and pathological
processes such as survival, cell growth and migration

and sphingosine, are considered pro-apoptotic and antimitotic agents. As S1P, sphingosine and ceramide are
interconvertible, it has been proposed that the balance of
this “sphingolipid rheostat” is critical in determining cell
death or survival [2]. S1P is formed by the phosphorylation
of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) or
sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2). SK1 has an important role
in cancer [1], as demonstrated by the finding that its
expression is upregulated at mRNA transcript and protein
levels in numerous types of solid cancers, including lung
cancers [3, 4] glioblastoma [5], thyroid cancer [6], and
breast carcinoma [7, 8]
Many studies reported that high tumor SK1
expression is associated with increased disease
progression, chemo-resistance and reduced patient
survival [5, 7, 9, 10]. Furthermore, a role of SK1 has been
recently proposed by Watson and colleagues in regulating
the Warburg effect in prostate cancer cells [11].
On the other hand, the role of SK2 in regulating
apoptosis is still a matter of debate, even though emerging
evidence has highlighted the importance of a role for SK2
in cancer. Some studies supported a pro-apoptotic role of
SK2 [12], while others demonstrated that selective SK2
inhibitors or siRNA silencing of SK2 induced cell death
in vitro and in vivo [13, 14]. In addition, silencing of
SK2 enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in breast
or colon cancer cells [15]. Therefore, it appears evident
that SKs represent a promising target for cancer therapy
and increasing efforts are being made to develop isoformselective inhibitors of SKs.
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
represents a malignant disorder arising from the neoplastic
transformation of T-cell progenitors. T-ALL accounts for
10-15% of pediatric and 25% of adult cases [16]. The
prognosis of pediatric T-ALL has recently improved due
to intensified therapies, attaining more than 75% cure rates
for children. However, pediatric T-ALL is prone to early
relapse, and the prognosis of relapsed and primary chemoresistant patients is poor [16]. Hence, more efficient and
new therapeutic strategies displaying less toxicity are now
required. Recently, the relevance of S1P in hematological
malignancies has been highlighted by several groups
[17, 18]. Importantly, a link between the S1P pathway
and major signaling pathways aberrantly activated in
T-ALL, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK cascades has been described [19]. For these
reasons, we decided to analyze the possible therapeutic
effects of two SK inhibitors in T-ALL cell lines and
primary cells: 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)
thiazole (SKi), an SK1/2 inhibitor, and (R)-FTY720
methyl ether (ROMe), a SK2-selective inhibitor [20].
We reported herein that SKi and ROMe affected
T-ALL cell viability; however, they exerted their effects
through different mechanisms. Indeed, we showed
here that the SK2 selective inhibitor ROMe induced an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

autophagic cell death, while SKi induced apoptosis.
Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that SKi
activated an ER stress/UPR pathway in a sub-population
of T-ALL cells, a signaling network induced by the
accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER. In
certain T-ALL cell lines, the UPR induced by SKi was
linked with a protective autophagic response that appeared
to be an attempt by the cells to counteract apoptosis
induced by SKi. Finally, we demonstrated that SKi is
synergistic with the conventional chemotherapeutic
agent vincristine, suggesting that combined treatment of
established chemotherapeutic agents with SK inhibitors
could be a feasible approach to achieve efficacy in the
treatment of T-ALL in the clinic. These results suggest that
SK1 or SK2 inhibition is linked with a complex network
of cell survival and death responses. Our findings provide
information that may open new avenues for therapeutics
designed to induce T-ALL cell death and thereby enable
better management of this cancer.

RESULTS
SKi displays cytotoxic effects on T-ALL cell lines
and patient T-ALL cells
Previous studies have shown that SKi displayed
anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects in acute and chronic
myeloid leukemia cell lines [21]. To determine whether
SKi also inhibited T-ALL cell proliferation and survival,
we performed MTT assays using Molt-4, Jurkat, CEM-S
and the drug-resistant CEM-R cell lines. Treatment of
these cells with increasing concentrations of SKi for 40
h induced a reduction in cell viability with IC50 values of
6.9, 18, and 9.4 µM in Molt-4, Jurkat and CEM-R cells
(Figure 1A). The IC50 for CEM-S cells was not attained
within the SKi concentration range used in this study. SKi
also affected cell viability of primary lymphoblasts from 4
different T-ALL pediatric patients with IC50 ranging from
0.79 to 5.5 µM (Figure 1B). In common with the T-ALL
cell lines, a sub-population of three of the patient T-ALL
cells appeared more resistant to SKi. Overall, these data
demonstrated that SKi reduced the viability of T-ALL
cell lines and primary human patient cells. This is likely
due to the induction of cell death as we did not detect an
impairment of the cell cycle at any time of cell treatment
with SKi (data not shown).

SKi promotes apoptosis in Molt-4 cell lines
In order to determine whether the decreased viability
was related to apoptosis, Molt-4 cells were treated with a
SKi concentration equivalent to the IC50 (6.9 µM) for 6,
16, 24 and 40 h, after which the cells were stained with
Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by
7887

Oncotarget

flow cytometry. Cells underwent apoptosis after 6 h of
SKi treatment as demonstrated by the increasing presence
of Annexin-V+/PI- and Annexin-V+/PI+ cells which reflect
early and late apoptosis, respectively (Figure 2A). The
presence of low levels of PI-positive only cells after 40 h
of treatment demonstrated that cell death was mainly due
to apoptosis.
We next measured the activation status of various
caspases. In this regard, activation of caspase -9, -3, and
-8, as well as cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) was evident in SKi-treated cells in a timedependent manner (Figure 2B). Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis highlighted the presence of
condensed apoptotic chromatin confirming apoptosis
induction (Figure 2C). Furthermore, western blot analysis
of LC3 protein, a widely recognized marker of autophagy,
demonstrated that the autophagic process was not activated
in Molt-4 cells (Figure 2D). This is consistent with the
unchanged expression levels of Ser 2448 p-mTOR, a
negative regulator of autophagy and whose decreased

expression might be related to autophagy induction [22].
It has been reported that chronic exposure to SKi
induced the proteasomal degradation of SK1 at protein
level in solid tumor cancer cell lines [23]. Thus, we
investigated whether a treatment of T-ALL cells with SKi
might regulate the expression of SK1. Molt-4, Jurkat and
CEM-R cells were treated with SKi for 40 h and SK1
expression was measured at both transcript and protein
levels. SK1 transcript did not significantly change in all
three cell lines (data not shown). SKi had no effect on
SK1 protein levels in Jurkat and CEM-R cells; however,
SKi induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4
cells (Figure 2E). As high SK1 expression and S1P levels
confer enhanced growth and survival to cells [5, 24, 25],
the increase in SK1 protein levels could represent an
attempt of Molt-4 cells to escape SKi-induced apoptosis.
Indeed, a sub-population of Molt-4 cells do appear more
resistant to high concentrations (> 5 µM) of SKi (Figure
1A), where there is no further decline in cell viability.

SKi induced an ER-stress-dependent autophagy
to protect cells against apoptosis in Jurkat and
CEM-R cell lines

UPR. The time course of ER stress was post-apoptotic
and correlated with autophagy (Figure 4A). Interestingly,
CEM-S cells, which were less sensitive to SKi, displayed
a stronger induction of IRE1α, and CHOP than CEM-R
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, Molt-4 cells,
did not display any significant induction of ER stress/UPR
hallmarks (Supplementary Figure 2).
Several lines of evidence have recently suggested a
pro-survival effect of ER stress/UPR signaling pathway
and autophagy in cancer [30, 31] while other studies
support a tumor-suppressive role of UPR [32, 33]. In
order to establish whether autophagy was a protective
mechanism involved in maintaining ER homeostasis
that subsequently promotes cancer cells survival, we
treated Jurkat and CEM-R cell lines with chloroquine, an
inhibitor of autophagy [34]. Treatment with increasing
concentrations of chloroquine had little effect on cell
viability after 40 h of incubation, whereas the combination
of chloroquine (at the fixed concentration of 20 µM) and
increasing concentrations of SKi induced a significant
decrease in cell viability (Figure 4B). These findings
indicated that the UPR/autophagic response is likely to be
a protective response that might account for the escape of
a sub-population of cells from SKi-induced death.

We next assessed the effects of SKi on the death
of Jurkat and CEM-R cell lines. SKi treatment of these
cells not only augmented the percentage of early and
late apoptotic cells, but also induced an increase in the
population of cells that were stained by Annexin-V–/
PI+ (Figure 3A and Figure 3B). Consequently, we
analyzed whether SKi activated apoptotic and autophagic
pathways in these cells. SKi activated apoptosis in Jurkat
and CEM-R cells as demonstrated by the cleavage of
caspase-3, -9, -8, -2, and PARP. Interestingly, in Jurkat and
CEM-R cells, caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage peaked at
6 h and was less evident or absent after longer exposure
to SKi. Therefore, consistent with the effect of SKi on cell
viability, these results supported the possibility that a subpopulation of Jurkat and CEM-R cells were resistant to
apoptotic death as evident in Figure 1A at concentrations
> 5 µM SKi, where there is no further decline in cell
viability.
Interestingly, there was a delayed conversion from
LC3 I to the lipidated form LC3 II at 24 and 40 h after
addition of SKi to the cells. These findings suggested the
activation of autophagy at later time points. Of note, there
was a concomitant down-regulation of p-mTOR (Ser2448)
that might release the inhibition of the autophagic process
that can be exerted by the mTORC1 complex (Figure 3C)
[26]. Therefore, the autophagic response occurred after
the peak of apoptotic response. This is consistent with an
adaptive protective mechanism that could account for the
resistance to SKi in a sub-population of the T-ALL cells.
We also investigated the effects of SKi (40 h
treatment) on the cellular structure and organization
in Jurkat and CEM-R cells, using TEM analysis. SKi
caused an enlargement of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
compared to controls, that is characteristic of ER stress,
and the appearance of autophagosomes containing cell
components (Figure 3D).
It is known that caspase-2 is implicated in the
modulation of cell death induced by DNA damage, ER
stress, and mitotic catastrophe [27]. It has also been
documented that a relationship exists between ER stress
and caspase-2 activation in human multiple myeloma
cells [28]. In addition, it has been recently reported that
ER stress and UPR activation drives apoptosis in T-ALL
cell lines [29]. The cleavage of caspase-2 and an enlarged
ER observed by TEM, prompted us to investigate if an
UPR in Jurkat and CEM-R cells is initiated in response
to SKi. We therefore analyzed the expression levels of
several ER stress/UPR hallmarks, such as IRE1α, GRP78
(BIP), p-eIF2α and CHOP. SKi induced a substantial
increase in the expression of these UPR proteins between
24 and 40 h, which confirmed the induction of ER stress/

SKi modulates signaling pathways involved in
survival, proliferation and stress response
Many studies have shown that drugs targeting the
S1P pathway can modulate crucial pro-survival signaling
cascades such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK [23, 35, 36]. In addition, S1P is linked to cancer cell
responses to stress such as stress-activated protein kinase/
Jun-amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) and MAPK
p38 networks [37]. Thus, we investigated whether SKi
treatment affected these signaling pathways in T-ALL cell
lines. Treatment of cells with SKi resulted in a decrease in
the phosphorylation of Akt at both threonine 308 (Thr308)
and serine 473 (Ser473) residues in Molt-4 cells. Indeed,
ceramide, which might accumulate as a consequence of
SK inhibition, has been shown to cause dephosphorylation
of Akt, possibly via activation of PP2A [38]. However,
SKi did not affect the phosphorylation of mTORC1
downstream targets S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP) and
eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)-4E-binding
protein 1 (4EBP1) (Figure 5A). SKi treatment reduced the
phosphorylation of Akt only at the Thr308 in Jurkat cells,
while CEM-R cells were resistant to modulation of Akt
phosphorylation by SKi. Interestingly, the phosphorylation
of JNK was markedly increased by SKi in Jurkat and
CEM-R cells and indicated that these cells are under
stress. p38 MAPK signaling was not affected in all the
three cell lines. However, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade
in Jurkat cell was profoundly reduced by treatment with
SKi (Figure 5A), in agreement with others [23, 35].

SKi synergizes with chemotherapeutic drugs

Therefore, these findings demonstrated that SKi
perturbed different signaling pathways which play crucial
role in leukemogenesis [39], and this might provide a
mechanistic explanation for the ability of SKi to induce
apoptosis.
To establish whether our findings are relevant
to human T-ALL, we performed experiments on
lymphoblasts from T-ALL patients. Cells were treated
with 10 µM SKi for 24 h and the status of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway was assessed. In agreement with
the findings in T-ALL cell lines, SKi induced a decrease in
the phosphorylation of Akt on both Thr308 and Ser473, as
well as a decrease of p-S6RP levels (Figure 5B). SKi also
induced apoptosis in T-ALL lymphoblasts as evidenced
by Annexin-V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis of
cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 5C).

The ability of a sub-population of T-ALL cells
to escape apoptosis in response to SKi prompted us
to evaluate whether treatment of cells with SKi could
potentiate the effect of established anti-cancer agents
or vice versa to circumvent this problem. We used
doxorubicin and vincristine (VCR), two drugs currently
in use for treating T-ALL patients [40]. Molt-4, Jurkat
and CEM-R cells were incubated for 40 h with increasing
concentrations of SKi alone (0.1-10 µM) or with SKi (0.110 µM) in combination with increasing concentrations of
VCR (1.0-100 nM). There was no observed synergistic
effect between SKi and VCR in CEM-R cells as well as
between SKi and doxorubicin at the concentrations we
used in the three cell lines (data not shown). However,

ROMe causes autophagic cell death in T-ALL cell
lines

a strong synergism between SKi and vincristine was
detected in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. This occurred at
concentrations of vincristine ranging from 5 to 10 nM
in both cell lines (Figure 6A). Of note, the combination
index (CI) analysis revealed that synergism occurred at
concentrations of SKi that were significantly lower than its
respective IC50 (synergism at 0.5 and 1 µM of SKi in Molt4 and Jurkat cells), suggesting that vincristine sensitized
T-ALL cells to SKi.

Despite the controversial role of SK2 in apoptosis
and cell fate, there is mounting evidence that SK2
is implicated in cancer. Indeed, several groups have
described the anti-cancer activity of different SK2selective inhibitors and SK2 siRNA in many types of
tumors [13, 14, 20, 41]. Hence, we examined the effect
of the SK2 inhibitor ROMe on the viability of T-ALL cell

lines. We incubated cells with increasing concentrations
of ROMe for 40 h. ROMe induced a reduction in cell
viability that was concentration-dependent and with
IC50 values of 8.8 µM for Molt-4 and CEM-R, 9.2 µM
for CEM-S, and 10.1 µM for Jurkat cells (Figure 7A).
Moreover, ROMe induced a complete reduction in cell
viability suggesting that the cells are unable to mount a
resistance response to this SK2 inhibitor.
To understand the mechanism of action of the
drug, we treated Molt-4, Jurkat and CEM-R cells with a
ROMe concentration equivalent to the IC50 for 4, 6, 24
and 40 h and then analyzed the effect on apoptotic and
autophagic pathways. Interestingly, the autophagic process
was activated in a sustained manner, as evidenced by the
accumulation of lipidated LC3-II (Figure 7B). Treatment

of cells with ROMe also induced cleavage of caspase-3,
-8 and -9, which peaked at 4 and 6 h, suggesting that
apoptosis is activated only at very early time-points and
the major cellular death is triggered by other mechanisms.
Consequently, TEM analysis was performed on the three
cell lines which revealed the typical autophagic features in
Molt-4, Jurkat and CEM-R cells (Figure 7C). In addition,
we demonstrated that, in all the three cell lines , exposure
to the autophagic inhibitors chloroquine, 3-methyladenine
(3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 markedly reduced the effect
of ROMe on cell viability (Figure 8A), whereas treatment
with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK does not
affect it (Figure 8A), suggesting that autophagy is the
major mechanism of cell death.
We next analyzed ER stress/UPR hallmarks. We

observed that these markers associated with autophagic
survival, did not exhibit any significant modulation,
suggesting that the UPR response is specific to SKi, and
possibly SK1 inhibition (Figure 8B) and that autophagy in
response to ROMe represents a cellular death mechanism.
Finally, we investigated whether ROMe modulates
signaling networks that regulate cell survival. In contrast
with SKi, ROMe did not affect any of the signaling
pathways analyzed with the exception of a reduction in
the levels of phosphorylated ERK in Jurkat and CEM-R

cells (Figure 8C).

DISCUSSION
A growing body of evidence indicates that
sphingolipids play a critical role in regulating several
physiological and pathophysiological processes,
including cancer. Indeed, S1P is found in higher levels
in many tumors compared with normal tissue and SK1
overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in solid

and hematological malignancies [1, 42]. Many efforts
are being devoted to the development of new molecules
targeting sphingolipid-based pathways. In recent years,
many compounds have been synthesized and tested in in
vitro and in vivo models of different type of cancers.
Among the chemical inhibitors that are selective
for SK2 over SK1, the best are ABC294640 [13], ROMe
[20], K145 [41], SLR080811 [43] and F02 [44], which
have moderate potency, with Ki values in the range

of ~1-10 μM. Moreover, treatment of MCF-7 breast
cancer cells with ROMe prevented actin enrichment
into lamellipodia in response to S1P, suggesting that
migratory and metastatic responses of cancers cells might
be dependent on SK2 [20]. In addition, ABC294640
suppressed the proliferation of several tumor cell lines,
and inhibited tumor cell migration associated with the loss
of actin microfilaments [13]. ABC294640 also displayed
significant in vivo activity and inhibited tumor progression

in mice with mammary adenocarcinoma xenografts [13].
More recent studies have demonstrated that ABC294640
induced autophagic death in A-498 kidney, PC-3 prostate
and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [36].
Despite excellent progress in the treatment of
T-ALL, with most promising results obtained in pediatric
patients, an efficient cure is still challenging. Mortality
from T-ALL is still 25% for children and 40-50% for adults
[16]. For this reason, innovative approaches that are more
effective and display less toxicity, especially for patients
who develop resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic
drugs, are needed.
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic
potential of two SK inhibitors in pre-clinical settings of
T-ALL. In particular, we tested SKi and ROMe, that target
SK1/SK2 and SK2, respectively, in T-ALL cell lines and
primary cells. We demonstrated that both inhibitors induce
a reduction in the cell viability with IC50 values that were
comparable, but they exerted their effects through different
mechanisms.
SKi initiated an apoptotic cell death in Molt-4,
Jurkat, and CEM-R cell lines, as well as in lymphoblasts
from T-ALL patients, in agreement with other studies
[3]. Although an apoptotic process was initiated upon
SKi treatment, a sub-population of T-ALL cell lines
seems to escape death using different strategies. A ‘nononcogene addiction’ has been proposed for SK1, as it has
been found over-expressed in many types of solid tumors
[42]. In the present study, we reported that SKi induced
increased expression of SK1 in Molt-4 cells. Since we
know from cytometric analysis that, after 40 h, a large
amount of cells die, it is possible that the remaining viable
cells represented a sub-population that are more resistant
to apoptosis owing to the adaptive increase in SK1
expression in these cells. This hypothesis is supported by
the negligible induction of ER stress/UPR pathway in this
cell line.
Jurkat and CEM-R cells behaved differently. We
did not observe any increased SK1 expression in these
cell lines. However, after 24 h of SKi treatment an ER
stress/UPR pathway was initiated. UPR is a highly
conserved stress pathway which is considered to be an
adaptive response for safeguarding cell survival and that
is aimed at restoring ER homeostasis [45]. It is known
that the ER stress/UPR pathway is a potent stimulus of
autophagy which represents an attempt by the cells to
counteract the ER stress [30, 31].We report here that
SKi induced the activation of an ER stress/UPR-induced
autophagy in Jurkat and CEM-R cell lines. TEM analysis
demonstrated the occurrence of alterations in ER structural
organization and double membrane autophagosomes in the
cytoplasm. These findings are consistent with an ongoing
autophagic process. Consistently, LC3 conversion, another
bona fide autophagic marker, was evident after 24 h of
the drug treatment. Of interest, in Jurkat and CEM-R,
but not in Molt-4 cell lines, we found a reduction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the phosphorylation status of mTOR (at Ser 2448)
which is a negative regulator of autophagy and whose
decreased expression might be associated with autophagy.
Accordingly, treatment of Jurkat and CEM-R cells with
chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy, potentiated rather
than prevented cell death, suggesting a cyto-protective role
of autophagy.
We also demonstrated that a combination of SKi
with vincristine, a drug commonly used in T-ALL therapy,
was synergistic in promoting T-ALL cell death. Therefore,
SKi could potentiate the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs
by surmounting the protective mechanisms, such as
autophagy that confer resistance to SKi.
Interestingly, we reported that SKi treatment
perturbed signaling cascades implicated in survival,
proliferation and stress response of cells in our in vitro
models. In particular, SKi treatment caused a reduction in
p-Akt in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. SKi could also modulate
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which is constitutively
activated in Jurkat cells. This caused a marked decrease
in p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) levels. In addition, there is a
strong increase in p-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) levels in Jurkat
and CEM-R cells, suggesting that these cells are under a
severe stress response. In fact, it is known that an increase
in SAPK/JNK signaling pathway is a common response
to many forms of stress, including ER stress (IRE1αinduced) [30].
We also assessed the effect of ROMe, a selective
SK2 inhibitor, on T-ALL cell line survival. Recently, it
was shown that the inhibition of SK2 activated autophagy
in solid tumors [11, 13]. Despite an initial cleavage of
caspases upon treatment of cells with ROMe, we found
that ROMe induced a cytotoxic response through the
activation of an autophagic process, as demonstrated
by TEM analysis and increased LC3 processing. This
hypothesis was then confirmed by treatment with the
autophagic inhibitors chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 and
3-MA that were able to block the effect of ROMe, whereas
the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was not. The
concomitant cleavage of caspases, detected only after 4
and 6 h of ROMe exposure, is not surprising, given the
strict interconnection between apoptosis and autophagy,
as reviewed by many authors [46-48].
Notably, ROMe did not activate the ER stress/UPR
pathway and did not perturb several signaling pathways
including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPK.
These data demonstrated that ROMe drives cell death
through different mechanisms compared with SKi. More
importantly, our findings demonstrated different cellular
outcomes of autophagy that might be determined by the
presence or absence of UPR and mTOR regulation.
In addition, the ability of ROMe to completely
reduce T-ALL cell viability suggested that, in our in vitro
models, no adaptive protective mechanisms are activated
by ROMe. This might suggest a more compelling
therapeutic utility for SK2 selective inhibition over and

above combined SK1 and SK2 inhibition in T-ALL cells.
In conclusion, the data presented here, strongly
suggest that SK1 or SK2 inhibition is linked with a
complex network of cell survival and death responses
in T-ALL cells. These findings also provide useful
information that could be used for designing novel SK2
inhibitors aimed at eradicating T-ALL cells and thereby
enabling a better management of this type of cancer.

Analysis of cell viability and apoptosis was carried
out after drug treatment by dual staining with Annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) as reported elsewhere
[54]. Cells were analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).

Western Blot analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis was carried out by standard
methods, as previously reported [55, 56]. Analysis with
an antibody to β-actin or β-tubulin demonstrated equal
protein loading. For SK1 analysis, whole cell extracts
were prepared as described [11].

Chemicals
Shingosine kinase (SKi) (2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole) was purchased by Calbiochem
(EMD Chemicals, San Diego, CA, USA). Vincristine and
doxorubicin were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and
Z-VAD-FMK were from Enzo Life Science (Plymouth
Meeting, PA, USA). ROMe ((R)-FTY720 methyl ether)
was synthesized according to Lim and colleagues [20].
Antibody to SK1 was as reported elsewhere [7]. For
western blot analysis, primary antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). For flow
cytometric analysis, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anticleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) was from Cell Signaling
Technology. p-Akt and p-S6RP levels were performed as
reported elsewhere [49, 50].

TEM analysis
TEM analysis was performed according to standard
techniques, as previously described [57], using a Philips
CM10 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) TEM.
Images were recorded on a Megaview III digital camera
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Combined drug effect analysis
The combination effect and a potential synergy
were evaluated from quantitative analysis of dose-effect
relationships as described previously [58, 59]. For each
combination experiment, a combination index (CI) number
was calculated using the Biosoft CalcuSyn software. This
method of analysis generally defines CI values of 0.9
to 1.1 as additive, 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic, and <0.3 as
strongly synergistic, whereas values >1.1 are considered
antagonistic.

Cell culture and primary samples
The T-ALL cell lines Molt-4, Jurkat, CEM-R (CEM
VBL100, drug-resistant cells overexpressing 170-kDa
P-glycoprotein [51], and CEM-S were grown in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Samples from T-ALL pediatric patients were
obtained with informed consent according to Institutional
guidelines and isolated using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham
Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and were grown in
complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20%
FBS, and ITS (insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite).

particular, T-ALL patient lymphoblasts (1 x 106 cells/
ml) were cultured in triplicate in flat-bottomed 96-well
plates at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cultures were carried out
for 48 and 96 h. Results were statistically analyzed by
GraphPadPrism Software (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA).
