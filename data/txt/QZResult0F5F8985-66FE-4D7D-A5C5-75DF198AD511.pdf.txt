Abstract
Nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) is tightly modulated by IKB
kinases and IKBA in the cytoplasm. On stimulation, NF-KB
translocates into the nucleus to initiate transcription;
however, regulation of its transcriptional activity remains
obscure. Here, we show that protein kinase C (PKC) D
controls the main subunit of NF-KB, RelA/p65. On exposure
to tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-A), the expression of RelA/
p65 target genes such as IKBA, RelB, and p100/p52 is upregulated in a PKCD-dependent manner. The results also
show that PKCD is targeted to the nucleus and forms a
complex with RelA/p65 following TNF-A exposure. Importantly, kinase activity of PKCD is required for RelA/p65
transactivation. In concert with these results, PKCD activates
RelA/p65 for its occupancy to target-gene promoters,
including IKBA and p100/p52. Moreover, functional analyses
show that inhibition of PKCD is associated with substantial
attenuation of NF-KB activity in response to TNF-A. These
findings provide evidence that PKCD orchestrates RelA/p65
transactivation, a requisite for NF-KB signaling pathway in
the nucleus. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5927–35]

Introduction
The protein kinase C (PKC) family represents serine and
threonine kinases that are responsible for a variety of cellular
responses such as growth, proliferation, transformation, and cell
death (1, 2). The PKC family is subdivided into three categories:
conventional, novel, and atypical PKCs (1, 2). Accumulating lines of
evidence have revealed that PKCy, a novel PKC, plays a crucial role
in the cellular response to genotoxic stress (3–5). On exposure to
DNA damage, PKCy is activated and cleaved by caspase-3 to form a
40 kDa catalytically active fragment. Overexpression of the PKCy
catalytic fragment induces chromatin condensation and DNA
fragmentation, which supports a role for PKCy cleavage in the
induction of apoptosis (6). Other studies have shown that PKCy
interacts with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase (7). c-Abl is a proapoptotic
tyrosine kinase that targets to the nucleus following genotoxic
stress (8–10). Importantly, c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation activates PKCy and induces its translocation to the nucleus (7).
Consistent with these findings, tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCy is
necessary for its nuclear translocation and subsequent caspasedependent cleavage (2, 11, 12). Previous studies have also shown

that the nuclear complex of c-Abl and Lyn tyrosine kinases includes
the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP1 (13, 14) and that PKCy
phosphorylates and inactivates SHPTP1 in response to genotoxic
stress (15). Another study showed that cells derived from PKCy-null
transgenic mice were defective in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis induced by DNA damage (16). We have recently shown that
PKCy phosphorylates the p53 tumor suppressor to induce
apoptotic cell death (17). Furthermore, recent studies have shown
that PKCy interacts with and phosphorylates Rad9, a key factor
involved in checkpoint regulation of the DNA damage responses
(18, 19). Inhibition of PKCy attenuates Rad9-mediated apoptosis.
These findings collectively support an essential role for PKCy in the
induction of apoptosis in the genotoxic stress response (2). By
contrast, several lines of studies showed a pivotal role for PKCy in
antiapoptotic function in response to cytokines, including tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a; refs. 20–22). Expression with a PKCy
kinase-dead mutant or with a small interfering RNA (siRNA)
targeting PKCy increased the apoptotic effect of TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand, whereas overexpression of PKCy
decreased it (22). Intriguingly, phosphorylation of PKCy on Tyr155
was required for its cleavage in response to TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand. In addition, cleavage of PKCy by caspases was
essential for its protective effect because overexpression of a
caspase-resistant mutant did not protect glioma cells from TNFrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis (22). Another
study showed that inhibition of PKCy attenuated TNF-a–induced
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activation in human neutrophils (21). A
further study suggested that PKCy depletion by PKCy siRNA
resulted in inhibition of TNF-mediated extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 activation, which is involved in an essential
component of TNF-a–mediated signaling (20). These findings
collectively imply a protective role for PKCy in TNF-a–induced
apoptosis. Precise mechanisms in which PKCy controls signaling
pathways to protect cells from apoptosis, however, remain obscure.
NF-nB is an inducible transcription factor that controls the
expression of several proteins involved in the regulation of cell
survival and immune response (23). NF-nB is a dimer formed
from a multisubset family consisting of RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel,
p105/p50 (NF-nB1), and p100/p52 (NF-nB2). NF-nB is activated
by a bewildering array of stimuli, including biological agents
such as TNF-a, interleukin (IL)-1, bacterial endotoxin, and
phorbol esters and cytotoxic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic
agents, ultraviolet light, oxidative stress, and ionizing radiation
(24, 25). Activation of NF-nB is regulated by multiple distinct
signaling cascades including inhibitors of the NF-nB (InB) kinase
(IKK) signalosome (26, 27). IKK phosphorylates InBa at Ser32
and Ser36 in response to a variety of stimuli, resulting in its
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (26, 27).
The released NF-nB targets to the nucleus and thereby induces
the expression of specific target genes. In addition to nuclear
translocation of the NF-nB complex, previous studies have
shown that a subunit of NF-nB, RelA/p65, is post-translationally

transactivation following TNF-a exposure.
A and B, 293T cells were pretreated
with or without rottlerin for 30 min followed
by treatment with TNF-a for indicated
times. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and
whole-cell lysates were subjected to

reverse transcription-PCR analysis
using primer sets for RelB (top ), p100/p52

modified such as phosphorylation or acetylation, and those
changes influence its transcriptional activity. However, recent
data showing a role for Ser536 phosphorylation by IKKs on RelA/
p65 activation in response to TNF-a remain controversial (28–
33). In this context, mechanisms for RelA/p65 transactivation
following nuclear translocation are largely unclear.
In this study, we show that inhibition of PKCy is associated with
attenuation of RelA/p65 transactivation in response to TNF-a. The
results show that PKCy translocates from the cytoplasm into the
nucleus after TNF-a exposure. Importantly, kinase activity of PKCy
is required for its nuclear targeting and RelA/p65 transactivation.
However, phosphorylation of RelA/p65 is not involved in PKCymediated activation of RelA/p65. These findings collectively
support a novel mechanism in which regulation of RelA/p65 by
PKCy contributes to TNF-a–induced activation of NF-nB signaling
pathway.

Figure 3. PKCy interacts with RelA/p65. A and B, 293T cells were treated with
TNF-a for indicated times. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-RelA/
p65 (A) or anti-PKCy (B) followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCy or
anti-RelA/p65. Immunoprecipitates with normal IgG were used as negative
control. C, U2OS cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-a in the
presence or absence of rottlerin. Twenty femtomoles of biotin-conjugated
nB-oligonucleotide probes were incubated with (lanes 1-4, 6, and 7) or without
(lane 5) nuclear lysates. Additional incubation with 200-fold molar excess
amount of unlabeled probes (lane 7 ) was included to assess specific
DNA-protein interaction.

Results
PKCD is involved in the activation of RelA/p65 transcription
function in response to TNF-A. Previous studies showed that
treatment of cells with TNF-a induces InBa degradation, resulting
in nuclear translocation and activation of NF-nB (37). To determine
if PKCy is involved in TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation, 293T cells
were treated with TNF-a in the presence or absence of the specific
PKCy inhibitor rottlerin. Subcellular fractionation assays revealed
that nuclear targeting of NF-nB including RelA/p65 and p105/p50
is independent of PKCy activity (Figs. 1A and 4A, nuclear lysates).
However, resynthesis of InBa after TNF-a exposure, which is
transcriptionally induced by RelA/p65 (38), was diminished in
rottlerin-treated cells, suggesting that PKCy activity is associated
with the activation of NF-nB transcription function (Fig 1A,
cytoplasmic lysates). Moreover, on exposure to TNF-a, increased

expression of RelB and p100/p52, both are also the transcriptional
targets of RelA/p65 (39, 40), significantly reduced in cells pretreated
with rottlerin (Fig. 1, whole-cell lysates). Similar results were
obtained in U2OS cells (Fig. 1C). To further define the involvement
of PKCy in transcriptional activity of RelA/p65, reverse transcription and subsequent PCR assays were done to monitor transcription of RelA/p65 target genes. The results showed that increased
expression of RelB and p100/p52 attenuated in cells pretreated
with rottlerin (Fig. 1B). Similar findings were obtained in U2OS
cells (data not shown). To confirm the requirement of PKCy in
RelA/p65 activation, U2OS cells were transfected with scramble
siRNA or PKCy-specific siRNA followed by treatment with TNF-a.
As shown for pretreatment with rottlerin (Fig. 1A-C), the status of
PKCy expression was not associated with nuclear translocation of
RelA/p65 and p105/p50 (Fig. 1D, nuclear lysates). In contrast, TNFa–induced expression of RelB and p100/p52 was markedly
attenuated in cells silenced for PKCy (Fig. 1D, whole-cell lysates).
Taken together, these results show that PKCy induces the
activation of RelA/p65 transcription function in response to TNF-a.
Nuclear targeting of PKCD triggers TNF-A–induced RelA/
p65 activation. To explore precise mechanisms in which PKCy
control RelA/p65, we first examined PKCy phosphorylation of
RelA/p65 because our previous study showed that PKCy activates
IKKa in response to oxidative stress (41). Other studies showed
that IKK phosphorylates RelA/p65 at Ser536 to induce its transactivation (31–33). Hence, to assess the possibility that PKCy
activates IKKs that subsequently phosphorylate Ser536, 293T cells
were treated with TNF-a in the presence or absence of rottlerin.
Immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-Ser536 showed no remarkable effect on Ser536 phosphorylation, indicating that IKK phosphorylation of RelA/p65 is irrelevant to PKCy on exposure to TNF-a
(Fig. 2A). Other studies have shown that phosphorylation of RelA/
p65 at Ser276 is essential for its activity after TNF-a stimulation
(29, 42). To examine the involvement of PKCy on Ser276 phosphorylation, 293T cells were treated with TNF-a in the presence or
absence of rottlerin. The results showed that PKCy activity is
scarcely involved in Ser276 phosphorylation following TNF-a
exposure (Fig. 2A). Another study has shown that phosphorylation
of RelA/p65 at Ser529 is essential for its activity after TNF-a
stimulation (43). To determine if PKCy is associated with Ser529
phosphorylation, 293T cells were left untreated or treated with TNFa in the presence or absence of rottlerin. Ser529 was constitutively
phosphorylated, and as shown for phosphorylation of Ser276 or
Ser536, there was no significant difference on Ser529 phosphorylation
with impairment of PKCy activity after TNF-a exposure (Fig. 2A).
These findings collectively indicate that PKCy affects RelA/p65 in
a phosphorylation-independent manner. Our previous studies also
showed that PKCy rapidly moves to the nucleus after genotoxic
stress and this nuclear targeting depends on its kinase activity (19).
These findings led us to examine whether TNF-a induces nuclear
translocation of PKCy. Subcellular fractionation assays clearly
showed that cytolasmic PKCy immediately moved into the nucleus
(Fig. 2B). Importantly, inhibition of PKCy activity impeded its
nuclear translocation following TNF-a treatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting the possibility that nuclear targeting of PKCy affects regulation
of TNF-a–induced RelA/p65 activation. To determine if nuclear
targeting of PKCy is dependent on RelA/p65, cells were pretreated
with NF-nB inhibitor followed by treatment with TNF-a. The results
showed that there is little, if any, effect of NF-nB activity on TNF-a–
induced nuclear translocation of PKCy (Supplementary Fig. S1). To
convince nuclear targeting of PKCy in response to TNF-a, we

performed immunofluorescent staining. Nuclear PKCy was increased after TNF-a stimulation (Fig. 2C and D). Moreover, in
concert with the immunoblot analysis, inhibition of PKCy activity by
rottlerin diminished its nuclear translocation in response to TNF-a,
confirming that kinase activity is required for nuclear targeting of
PKCy (Fig. 2C and D). We also confirmed that TNF-a–induced
nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 is independent of PKCy activity
(Fig. 2C).
PKCD interacts with RelA/p65 after TNF-A exposure. The
findings that both PKCy and RelA/p65 move into the nucleus
following TNF-a treatment provided a conceivable model in which
PKCy associates with RelA/p65. To address this possibility, 293T
cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-a; then, cell lysates
were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RelA/p65 and

subsequent immunoblotting with anti-PKCy. PKCy was coimmunoprecipitated with RelA/p65 in TNF-a–treated cells but not
untreated cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, reciprocal experiments
confirmed this interaction (Fig. 3B). These findings show the
inducible interaction of PKCy with RelA/p65 after TNF-a exposure.
To examine whether PKCy affects NF-nB activity, U2OS cells were
left untreated or treated with TNF-a in the presence or absence of
rottlerin. Nuclear lysates were then subjected to electrophoretic
mobility shift assay analysis. A shifted band was detected when the
nB probes were incubated with nuclear lysates from TNF-a–treated
cells but not control cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the band disappeared
in the presence of rottlerin, suggesting that PKCy activity is
required for the efficient binding of NF-nB to nB elements in
response to TNF-a.

Figure 5. PKCy is involved in NF-nB transactivation in response to TNF-a.
A, 293 cells expressing pNF-nB-luc were left untreated or treated with rottlerin
followed by the treatment with TNF-a for indicated times. Luciferase assays were
done. Mean F SD from three independent experiments, each done in
triplicate. B, 293/NF-nB-luc cells were transfected with scramble siRNA, PKCy
siRNA, or RelA/p65 siRNA followed by the treatment with (closed columns ) or
without (open columns ) TNF-a for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h
post-transfection. Mean F SD from three independent experiments, each done
in triplicate.

PKCD controls RelA/p65 occupancy to the target-gene
promoters. To further define the functional interaction between
PKCy and RelA/p65, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to clarify the role for PKCy on promoter binding of
RelA/p65. 293T cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-a in
the presence or absence of rottlerin. Isolated chromatin was
immunoprecipitated with anti-RelA/p65 or control IgG followed by
PCR analysis with primers targeted to the nB elements of InBa or
p100/p52 promoter. RelA/p65 occupancy to the InBa promoter
was detectable after TNF-a exposure (Fig. 4A). Importantly,
inhibition of PKCy activity abrogated this occupancy (Fig. 4A).
Similar results were obtained with the p100/p52 promoter (Fig. 4A).
To establish the requirement of PKCy on binding of RelA/p65 to the
target-gene promoters, 293T cells were transfected with scramble
siRNA or PKCy-specific siRNA followed by treatment with TNF-a.
As shown for rottlerin, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses
revealed that RelA/p65 occupies the nB elements of InBa promoter
in control cells and not PKCy silencing cells (Fig. 4B). Similar
findings were obtained with the p100/p52 promoter (Fig. 4B).
Taken together, these results show that PKCy is required for the
binding of RelA/p65 to the nB elements in response to TNF-a. The
demonstration that PKCy inducibly interacts with RelA/p65
following TNF-a exposure led us to determine if PKCy forms a
complex with RelA/p65 on the promoters. As expected, chromatin
immunoprecipitation analyses with anti-PKCy immunoprecipitates

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

clearly showed that, on exposure to TNF-a, PKCy occupies the nB
elements of InBa promoter (Fig. 4C). More importantly, inhibition
of PKCy activity was associated with complete abrogation of its
occupancy (Fig. 4C). Comparable results were obtained with the
p100/p52 promoter (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that PKCy
and RelA/p65 form a complex to occupy nB elements on RelA/p65
target promoters in response to TNF-a. Furthermore, activation of
PKCy is necessary to induce the transcription function of RelA/p65.
To determine if recruitment of PKCy to the promoters depends on
its interaction with RelA/p65. U2OS cells were transfected with
scramble siRNA or RelA/p65 siRNA followed by treatment with
TNF-a. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed
that TNF-a–induced PKCy occupancy to the InBa promoter was
completely abolished in cells silenced for RelA/p65 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Similar results were obtained with the p100/p52
promoter (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These findings suggest that
PKCy binding to the promoters of the NF-nB target genes is
dependent on its interaction with RelA/p65. To address the
mechanism of PKCy-dependent recruitment of RelA/p65 to the
promoters of NF-nB genes, we have performed re-chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated
with anti-PKCy as the first antibody, and the eluted samples were
then immunoprecipitated with anti-RelA/p65 or anti-IgG antibody.
Chromatin templates containing nB elements of InBa promoter,
which were associated with PKCy, were also immunoprecipitated
by anti-RelA/p65 but not by anti-IgG after TNF-a exposure (Fig. 4D).
More importantly, this co-occupancy was markedly diminished in
the presence of rottlerin (Fig. 4D). To confirm these results, we
performed reciprocal re-chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in
which anti-RelA/p65 was used for the first immunoprecipitation
and then anti-PKCy for the second immunoprecipitation. As
expected, the results yielded similar conclusions (Fig. 4D). These
findings indicate that, on exposure to TNF-a stimulation, PKCy
may form a complex with RelA/p65 to occupy nB elements and that
this activation of PKCy may be required for the co-occupancy to
nB elements.
PKCD induces transcriptional activity of RelA/p65 following
TNF-A exposure. To examine whether PKCy enhances TNF-a–
induced RelA/p65 activation, 293 cells stably transfected with the
luciferase-reporter vector-containing nB elements were treated
with TNF-a in the presence or absence of rottlerin. Pretreatment
with rottlerin significantly attenuated the NF-nB activity in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5A). By sharp contrast, there was little, if
any, effect on pretreatment of classic PKC inhibitor Gö6976 (data
not shown). To confirm this finding, cells were transfected with
scramble siRNA, PKCy-specific siRNA, or RelA/p65-specific siRNA.
As expected, silencing of RelA/p65 was associated with pronounced
inhibition of NF-nB activity in response to TNF-a (Fig. 5B).
Importantly, knocking down PKCy significantly diminished TNF-a–
induced NF-nB activation (Fig. 5B).
PKCD affects cellular function of NF-KB by controlling RelA/
p65 in response to TNF-A. To examine the biological significance
of PKCy-dependent regulation of RelA/p65 transcriptional activity,
we have investigated TNF-a–induced IL-6 production and
apoptotic cell death. 293T cells were left untreated or treated with
TNF-a in the presence or absence of rottlerin. As expected, TNF-a
stimulation substantially imposed IL-6 production (Fig. 6A, left). In
contrast, inhibition of PKCy activity by pretreatment with rottlerin
impaired production of IL-6 in response to TNF-a (Fig. 6A, left).
Similar results were obtained with U2OS cells silenced for PKCy
(Fig. 6A, right). These data show that PKCy induces transcriptional

activity of RelA/p65 to produce IL-6 in response to TNF-a. With
regard to the apoptotic insults, U2OS cells were left untreated or
treated with TNF-a in the presence or absence of rottlerin. Analysis
of TUNEL assays revealed that apoptotic cells were slightly
increased following TNF-a exposure (Fig. 6B). Importantly, TNFa–induced apoptotic induction was significantly enhanced in the
presence of rottlerin (Fig. 6B). Comparable findings were obtained
with cells silenced for PKCy (Fig. 6B). To further assess TNF-a–
induced apoptosis, cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-a
in the presence or absence of NF-nB inhibitor. Analysis of TUNEL
assays showed that impeding NF-nB activity facilitates apoptotic
cell death induced by TNF-a (Fig. 6B). Similar results were
obtained in cells transfected with RelA/p65 siRNA (Fig. 6B). To
substantiate whether the finding that inhibition of PKCy potentiates TNF-a–induced apoptosis is dependent on NF-nB, NF-nB
inhibitor was cotreated together with rottlerin in cells. After TNF-a
stimulation, induction of apoptosis by combination of NF-nB
inhibitor and rottlerin was comparable with that by NF-nB
inhibitor or RelA/p65 siRNA alone (Fig. 6B). Consistent results
were obtained with combination of NF-nB inhibitor and PKCy
siRNA (Fig. 6B). These results show that abrogation of the PKCyNF-nB signaling, at least in part, diminishes the protective effect
from TNF-a–induced apoptotic cell death. As a result, cells
undergoing apoptosis were significantly increased.
Taken together, these findings thus support a model in which, on
exposure to TNF-a, PKCy is targeted into the nucleus and forms a
complex with RelA/p65 to activate transcription function on the
promoters (Fig. 6C). More importantly, PKCy plays a crucial role in
NF-nB activation by controlling RelA/p65 to regulate cellular
function and fate in response to TNF-a.

Discussion
NF-nB is a key transcription factor in cell survival, immunity,
development, and many other important biological processes.
Understanding regulation of NF-nB thus contributes to elucidation
for cellular response to the homeostasis system. Accumulating
lines of evidence have revealed that NF-nB is activated by various
stimuli such as cytokines, radiation, viral infection, and reactive
oxygen species (27). In this study, we have focused on TNF-a–
induced NF-nB activation. In resting cells, NF-nB is localized in the
cytoplasm tethered by InBa. Once IKK signalosome is activated by
various stimuli, InBa is phosphorylated and degraded to allow
nuclear translocation of dimeric NF-nB. Numerous studies have
paid much attention on regulation of nuclear targeting of NF-nB in
response to diverse stimuli. However, little is known about an
activation mechanism of NF-nB in the nucleus. In this regard, the
present study shows that PKCy is involved in RelA/p65 activation
in the nucleus. We have shown previously that PKCy translocates
into the nucleus after treatment of cells with 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (19). Moreover, pretreatment with rottlerin attenuated nuclear targeting of PKCy (19). We also proved that PKCy
activates nuclear substrates by phosphorylation, including Rad9,
topoisomerase IIa, and p53, to induce apoptosis in response to
DNA damage (2). These findings support a model in which, on
exposure to genotoxic stress, PKCy is targeted to the nucleus and
phosphorylates several nuclear targets for induction of apoptosis.
In the present study, the results indicate TNF-a–induced nuclear
translocation of PKCy and its interaction with RelA/p65. To our
best knowledge, this is the first report showing nuclear translocation of PKCy after TNF-a stimulation. Mechanisms for nuclear

Figure 6. PKCy affects NF-nB to induce IL-6 and to protect apoptosis following
TNF-a exposure. A, 293T cells were pretreated with or without rottlerin for
30 min followed by treatment with TNF-a for 24 h. The amount of secreted IL-6
production was measured by ELISA. Mean F SD from three independent
experiments, each done in triplicate (left ). **, P < 0.01. U2OS cells were
transfected with the PKCy siRNA and then treated with TNF-a. IL-6 was
measured as mentioned above (right ). *, P < 0.05. B, U2OS cells were
pretreated with rottlerin or NF-nB inhibitor and then left untreated (open columns )
or treated with TNF-a (closed columns ) for 24 h. Cells were transfected with
the PKCy siRNA or RelA/p65 siRNA followed by treatment with TNF-a. NF-nB
inhibitor was also coincubated together with rottlerin or PKCy siRNA in cells.
TUNEL assays were done to assess apoptotic cell death. Mean F SD from five
fields of 100 to 300 cells, each done for at least three independent experiments.
C, a proposed model of the PKCy!RelA/p65 pathway and NF-nB signaling in
response to TNF-a. On exposure to TNF-a, PKCy and RelA/p65 translocate from
the cytoplasm into the nucleus. PKCy then forms a complex with RelA/p65
on the nB elements of the promoter to facilitate transactivation of NF-nB.

targeting of PKCy remain unclear. Nevertheless, the findings that
kinase activity is required for nuclear translocation, as shown
similarly in the genotoxic stress response (19), suggest a common
machinery for its nuclear migration. We also found inducible
interaction between PKCy and RelA/p65 predominantly in the
nucleus after TNF-a stimulation (Figs. 2C and 3A and B). In this
context, at least in a physiologic condition, activation of PKCy
would be prerequisite for its nuclear targeting and subsequent
binding to RelA/p65. These data thus suggest that both activity of
and interaction with PKCy could be indispensable for TNF-a–
induced RelA/p65 activity. The demonstration that inhibition of
PKCy by rottlerin abrogates its interaction with RelA/p65 (data not
shown) further supports the involvement for nuclear targeting of
PKCy on exposure to TNF-a. More importantly, rottlerin or siRNA
blocked TNF-a–induced InBa or p100/p52 expression (Fig. 1),
suggesting that inducible nuclear interaction between PKCy and
RelA/p65 is, at least in part, essential for activation of NF-nB
signaling pathways in response to TNF-a. In concert with these
observations, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further
indicated that both PKCy and RelA/p65 are detectable on nB
elements of InBa or p100/p52 promoters, and these occupancies
are substantially diminished by inhibition of PKCy activity. These
findings thus indicate that PKCy is associated with the regulation
of RelA/p65 transcriptional activity elicited by TNF-a. Moreover, it
is conceivable that PKCy controls RelA/p65 by inducible interaction because PKCy is not involved in nuclear targeting of RelA/p65
(Figs. 1A and D, 2C, and 4A). Another issue to be solved is the
precise mechanism by which PKCy regulates RelA/p65 in the
nucleus. Given previous findings that PKCy activates IKKa by
oxidative stress and IKKa can phosphorylate and activate RelA/p65
at Ser536, we examined whether PKCy activates RelA/p65 by IKKamediated phosphorylation at Ser536. The present results clearly
showed that PKCy is not involved in Ser536 phosphorylation
following TNF-a exposure. We also showed the dispensable role for
PKCy on Ser276 and Ser529 phosphorylation of RelA/p65. It also
remains elusive whether PKCy directly regulates the other NF-nB
members, such as RelB or p100/p52, in response to TNF-a. Further
studies are needed to clarify this issue and this feasibility is
currently under investigation.
In tumor cell lines, the role of PKCy is a paradox. It can
induce both cell survival and apoptosis depending on cell types

and its subcellular localization (2). For instance, treatment with
anticancer agents resulted in a translocation of PKCy from
cytoplasm into nucleus concomitant with induction of apoptosis
(12, 19, 44). Our recent studies showed PKCy is involved in
phosphorylation of p53 and potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis
in response to DNA damage (17). PKCy also induces transcription of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the apoptotic response
to DNA damage (35). These results thus indicate that PKCy
functions as a proapoptotic kinase in response to genotoxic
stress (2). However, in this study, inhibition of PKCy depressed
both DNA binding of RelA/p65 and expression of the
antiapoptotic proteins, RelB and p100/p52 (Fig. 1). In agreement
with these results, PKCy has been identified as a prosurvival
factor in human breast tumor cell lines (45). Moreover, activation
of PKCy increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins, FLIP
(46) and cIAP-2 (47). In multiple myeloma cells, down-regulation
of PKCy resulted in apoptosis (48). These findings show a role
for PKCy on antiapoptotic regulation in some tumor cells. In
this regard, previous studies also suggested an antiapoptotic role
for PKCy in response to TNF-a; however, precise mechanisms
remain unknown (20–22). Importantly, numerous studies have
shown the association between constitutive NF-nB activity in
various types of cancer (49). The present study thus shows that
PKCy is a pivotal activator of NF-nB and is essential for its
nuclear function in tumors. A thorough understanding of how
PKCy/NF-nB pathway regulates cell fate should help benefit for
the cancer therapy.
