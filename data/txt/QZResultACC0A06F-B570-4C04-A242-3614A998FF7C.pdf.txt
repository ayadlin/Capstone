ABSTRACT
CD133 is a cellular surface glycoprotein that has been reported as a marker for
the enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the regulatory mechanism of
CD133 remains unknown. CSCs have been proposed to contribute to radioresistance
and multi-drug resistance. The elucidation of key regulators of CD133 and CSCs is
critical for the development of CSC-targeted therapy. In this study, we showed that
Ikaros inhibited the expression of CD133 via direct binding to the CD133 P1 promoter
and repressed the tumorigenic and self-renewal capacity of CD133+ cancer stem-like
cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that Ikaros interacted with CtBP
as a transcription repressor complex, which inhibited CD133 expression in HCC. We
also demonstrated that Ikaros expression was up-regulated by ETS1 which activity
was regulated by MAPKs pathway. Furthermore, decreased expression of Ikaros
was significantly associated with poor survival in HCC patients. Overall, our study
identifies that Ikaros plays a role as a transcription repressor in HCC and is a new
reactivated therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. Meanwhile, our findings
provide evidence that Ikaros could be an attractive inhibitor of the target gene CD133,
which reactivates anticancer mechanisms in targeted CSC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

stable cisplatin-resistant phenotype in vitro [2]. Thus, the
efficient identification and isolation of CSCs from cancer
cell lines or tumor tissues is necessary and helpful for the
development of anti-cancer strategies targeting CSCs.
Multiple of cell surface markers such as CD13, CD44,
DLK1, ALDH1, CD133 have been used to isolate and
identify CSCs in solid tumors [3-10], in which CD133
has been identified as a marker for enrichment of CSCs in
HCC. Compared with CD133- cells, CD133+ cells exhibit
significantly higher proliferation potential as well as a
greater capacity for colony formation and tumor initiation

HCC is one of the most common malignancies
worldwide [1]. Currently, there is no effective systemic
chemotherapy for patients with advanced HCC because
HCC is relatively chemotherapy-resistant and exhibits
high rates of recurrence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are
generally considered to be key contributors to tumor
initiation, maintenance, chemoresistance, radioresistance,
recurrence, and metastasis. CD133+ CSCs from lung
cancer are in enrichment after cisplatin treatment and have

in vivo [5-10]. CD133+ cells are typically reactivated in
HCC, and the expression of CD133 increases in higherstage tumors. This enhancement of CD133 expression
typically indicates poor patient prognosis [11]. However,
little is known regarding the characteristics and molecular
regulation of CD133 and CD133+ cancer stem-like cells
in HCC.
Ikaros is a member of the Kruppel family of zinc
finger DNA-binding protein [12], which is the crucial
regulator of normal hematopoiesis, and has been identified
as a tumor suppressor associated with the development
of leukemia [13, 14, 15]. Loss of Ikaros function is
thought to be essential to the development of lymphoid
leukemia, including adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (B-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia and infant
T-cell ALL [13, 16, 17]. Ikaros mutation or polymorphism
is a typical genetic feature in human B-ALL [18]. In
general, Ikaros binds to promoter regions and regulates
target gene expression by recruiting promoter regions
into pericentromeric heterochromatin. As a result, its
target genes are suppressed via chromatin remodeling.
The expression of Hes1 and Deltex are repressed by the
direct binding of Ikaros to their promoters [19, 20]. Ikaros
also plays important role in the development of nervous
system, and the cerebral cortex and hypothalamic–
pituitary somatotroph development [21, 22]. The essential

function of Ikaros in leukemia is obvious; however, the
role of Ikaros in solid tumors remains unclear, particularly
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
In this study, we showed that Ikaros interacted
with the transcription repressor CtBP as a complex and
inhibited CD133 expression via direct binding to the
CD133 P1 promoter in HCC. Moreover, biological
activation of CD133+ cancer stem-like cells was regulated
by Ikaros in HCC. We confirmed that ETS1 up-regulated
the expression of Ikaros. In addition, patients with higher
Ikaros expression had longer survival. Thus, our results
suggest that reactivation of Ikaros could be a novel
strategy for treatment of HCC.

RESULTS
P1 promoter is the main 5`-UTR pattern of CD133
in HCC
In our previous study, we showed that CD133 was
used to isolate and identify CSCs in HCC and CD133+
HCC cells exhibited the biological characteristics of
cancer stem cell in HCC [6, 7]. To understand the
regulatory mechanism of CD133 expression, we examined

the CD133 promoter. Five alternative promoters (P1, P2,
P3, P4, and P5) were identified in the 5’-UTR of CD133
(Supplementary Figure S1A) [23]. Reporter assays
revealed that the P1 promoter exhibited the highest
activity of the five pattern promoters of CD133 in Hep3B,
Huh7 and PLC/PRF5 (Figure 1A), which have higher
expressions of CD133 mRNA and protein (Supplementary
Figure S1B and C), and RT-PCR further confirmed that the
P1 promoter was the principal promoter of CD133 (Figure
1B).
We successively deleted the sequences of P1
promoter and investigated the activity of these promoters.
The promoter activity was increased when -260/-150-bp
sequences were deleted (Figure 1C). We concluded that
this region might contain transcription repressor binding
sites. We further analyzed the transcription factor binding
sites in the P1 promoter and multiples of transcription

factors sites were found in this region (Figure 1D). Some
of these transcription factors were able to down-regulate
the expression of CD133, such as c-ETS1, Ikaros and
Nkx3.1 (Supplementary Figure S1D). Taken together,
these results showed that the P1 promoter was the key
promoter of CD133 in HCC.

Ikaros inhibits CD133 expression by directly
binding to the CD133 promoter
One Ikaros binding site was observed at -212/-221bp region in the CD133 P1 promoter. Ikaros is a crucial
regular in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells
and has been identified as a tumor suppressor associated
with the development of leukemia [13, 14, 24, 25]. To
identify whether Ikaros also played an important role in

CD133 expression, we examined the P1 promoter activity
when Ikaros was overexpressed. Report assays showed
that the P1 promoter activity was inhibited when Ikaros
was enforced to express in HCC cells (Figure 2A). ChIP
assays and DNA pull-down assays confirmed that Ikaros
directly bound to the CD133 P1 promoter in HCC cells
(Figure 2B and C). However, CD133 promoter activity
was unchanged in response to Ikaros overexpression
when the Ikaros binding site in the CD133 promoter
was mutated (Supplementary Figure S2A). The 157
phenylalanine (F), 162 arginine (R), and 184 arginine
(R) have been confirmed to be necessary for Ikaros
DNA binding activity and subcellular localization [26].
Therefore, we constructed three mutants in which these
three critical amino acids were mutated to alanine (A).
Report assays showed that P1 promoter activity had no
change when these mutant Ikaros were overexpressed
(Supplementary Figure S2B).
To further determine whether Ikaros could downregulate CD133 expression, CD133 expression was
detected after ectopic overexpression or knockdown of
Ikaros. Overexpressed Ikaros decreased the expression of
CD133, while silenced Ikaros increased CD133 expression
(Figure 2D). The mRNA and protein levels of Ikaros and

CD133 were negatively correlated in nine HCC cell lines
using qPCR and western blot (Supplementary Figure
S1B and C). To better understand the correlation between
Ikaros and CD133, immunohistochemical staining (IHC)
analysis was performed in 102 human primary HCC
samples. IHC analysis showed that Ikaros protein levels
inversely correlated with CD133 expression in HCC
tissues (Figure 2E and F). Together, these results suggested
that Ikaros inhibited the expression of CD133 via direct
binding to the CD133 P1 promoter in HCC.

CtBP could interact with Ikaros and regulate
CD133 expression in HCC cells
Usually, Ikaros interacts with co-repressors
as complexes to regulate target genes. The coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed
to identify the co-repressors of Ikaros in HCC cells.
Approximately, 40-50 kD proteins were precipitated from
the three HCC cell lines (Figure 3A). We suspected that
CtBP, with a molecular weight of approximately 48 kD,
interacted with Ikaros as a co-repressor [27]. To determine
whether Ikaros interacts with CtBP in HCC, we analyzed
precipitated samples using western blot. CtBP was

identified in anti-Ikaros precipitated samples and Ikaros
was also detected in anti-CtBP precipitated fractions
(Figure 3B). Next, we investigated the subcellular location
of Ikaros and CtBP using immunofluorescence staining.
Results demonstrated that these proteins were co-localized
in HCC cells (Figure 3C). ChIP assays showed CtBP
was able to bind to CD133 P1 promoter, which further

confirmed the interaction between CtBP and Ikaros
(Figure 3D). Uniformly, the CD133 promoter activity was
inhibited by overexpression of CtBP (Figure 3E). Taken
together, these findings confirmed that CtBP interacted
with Ikaros and regulated CD133 expression in HCC.

severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice.
Ikaros significantly inhibited the tumorigenicity of
CD133+ cells (Figure 5B). Western blot showed that the
expression of CD133 from xenograft mouse models was
inhibited by Ikaros in vivo (Supplementary Figure S4D).
Ikaros not only repressed CD133 expression, but
also decreased the proportion of CD133+ HCC cells
upon forced Ikaros expression (Huh7 cells for around
28.1%; PLC/PRF/5 cells for around 83.2%) (Figure
5C). In addition, the proportion of CD133+ HCC cells
were increased when Ikaros was silenced (HCC-LY5
cells for approximately 34 times; SMMC-7721 cells for
approximately 72 times) (Figure 5D). We further examined
differentiated molecular marker Cytokeratin 18 (CK18)
and Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) in Ikaros-transfected HCC
cells. CK18 and CK 19 were increased and decreased,
respectively, when Ikaros was overexpressed. Moreover,
CK18 and CK19 had opposite changes after Ikaros was
knocked down (Figure 5E). These data confirmed that
Ikaros could efficiently inhibit tumorigenicity and the selfrenewal capacity of CD133+ CSCs in HCC.

To detect which pathway participates in the
regulation of Ikaros and CD133 expression, we analyzed
the Ikaros promoter. One binding site for the transcription
factor ETS1 was found in the Ikaros promoter at the -69/59-bp region (Figure 4A). Reporter assays showed that
Ikaros promoter activity was significantly enhanced in
response to ETS1 overexpression (Figure 4A). Ohnishi
et al showed that the ETS family transcription factors
regulate CD133 via direct binding of CD133 to the P5
promoter in colon cancer cells [28]. One ETS1 binding site
was also predicted in the CD133 P1 promoter. However,
ChIP assays revealed that ETS1 did not bind to this site
(Supplementary Figure S3A).
ChIP assay and DNA pull-down assay further
confirmed that ETS1 directly bound to the Ikaros promoter
(Figure 4B and C). When ETS1 was silenced, we did not
detect the binding between ETS1 and Ikaros promoter
(Supplementary Figure S3B). Ikaros expression was
upregulated by overexpressing ETS1 and down-regulated
by ETS1 knockdown, while CD133 expression exhibited
the opposite changes compared with Ikaros (Figure 4D
and E). ETS1 activity was inhibited via phosphorylated by
Erk1/2 [29, 30]. In addition, specific inhibitors PD98059
and U0126 were utilized to block Erk1/2 activity. The
expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2 and ETS1, Ikaros,
and CD133 also correspondingly changed after treatment
with these inhibitors (Figure 4F). Taken together, these
results indicated that the MAPKs/ETS1 pathway regulates
Ikaros and CD133 expression in HCC.

High Ikaros levels indicate longer survival in
HCC patients
We analyzed Ikaros expression in 102 pairs of
human primary HCC and matched noncancerous liver
specimens using IHC. The IHC analysis demonstrated
that Ikaros expression was at low levels in HCC samples
(Figure 6A), and 17.8% (18/102) of human primary HCC
specimens with Ikaros protein staining was higher than
paired nontumorous liver specimens. Western blot showed
that the protein levels of Ikaros were down-regulated in
primary HCC tissues (Figure 6B).
According to the IHC results, the expression
intensity of Ikaros protein was scored as 0, 1 for weak
and strong immunostaining, respectively. The results
showed that Ikaros expression was negatively associated
with histological grade of HCC and tumor size (Table
1). However, there was no correlation between Ikaros
expression and other clinicopathological indexes,
including age, gender, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
intrahepatic metastasis, hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) levels, and with or without cirrhosis (Table 1).
Further, overall survival analysis revealed that the high
expression of Ikaros was closely associated with good
outcomes in HCC patients (Figure 6C).
We then tested relative molecular in 7 pairs of HCC
and their matched adjacent liver tissue samples (Figure
6D). Western blot showed that phosphorylation of Erk1/2
and ETS1 was increased, and Ikaros expression decreased
and CD133 expression increased in HCC tissue. Overall,
we proposed that Ikaros interacting with CtBP played roles
as transcription repressors in inhibiting CD133 expression
via binding to P1 promoter, and MAPKs pathways

Ikaros inhibits the tumorigenic and self-renewal
capacity of CD133+ HCC cells
Next, we determined the function of Ikaros in
HCC. Cell-proliferation assay revealed that forced Ikaros
expression remarkably inhibited the cell growth of HCC
cells in vitro (Supplementary Figure S4A). We found
that Ikaros had more effect to HCC cells with high-level
expression of CD133. Colony-formation assay using
sorted CD133+/- cells from HCC-LY5, SMMC-7721
and MHCC-LM3 cells also showed that the suppression
of growth by Ikaros overexpression was more effective
in CD133+ cells than CD133- cells (Supplementary
Figure S4B). The self-renewal capacity of Huh7 and
CD133+ PLC/PRF/5 cells was significantly inhibited by
transfection with Ikaros (Figure 5A). When HCC cells
transfected with Ikaros were treated with Cisplatin, the
IC50 value was decreased. These cells were also more
susceptible to Doxorubicin and Sorafenib (Supplementary
Figure S4C). Next, CD133+ or CD133- cells transfected
with Ikaros or control from SMMC-7721 or HCC-LY5
were subcutaneously injected into non-obese diabetic/

indirectly regulated the expression of Ikaros and CD133
via ETS1 (Figure 6E).

In our study and other previous studies, CD133
was identified as a marker of CSCs in HCC [5, 6, 7].
Overexpression of CD133 in cancers is closely related
to the poor prognosis associated [32]. Although several
patterns of CD133 regulation have been reported, its
mechanism still remains unclear. CD133 expression was
regulated by Sp1/myc [33]. CD133 and CD133+ CSCs
was found to be regulated by miR-142-3p in HCC [34],
and Lupeol inhibited liver tumor-initiating cells and
decreased CD133 expression through phosphatase and
tensin homolog modulation [35]. CD133 expression
is enhanced under hypoxic conditions via HIF-1α/
mTOR signaling in glioblastoma [31, 36]. Furthermore,
epigenetic modification was another important factor
for the regulation of CD133 expression in many tumors.

DISCUSSION
Although Ikaros plays an indispensable role in the
development of leukemia, its role in solid tumors remains
unknown. Yang et al examined the relationship between
Ikaros expression and prognosis in 13 types of cancers
and found that the relationship varied between cancers,
even between the same cancers obtained from different
databases [31]. In the current study, we confirmed for
the first time that Ikaros plays an important role in HCC.
We determined that Ikaros functions as a transcription
repressor and inhibits CD133 expression in HCC.

TGFβ has been shown to elevate CD133 expression via
demethylation of the CD133 P1 promoter by inhibiting the
expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3β [37] and Promoter
methylation decreased CD133 expression in ovarian
cancer and glioblastoma [33, 38].
In this study, we determined that Ikaros suppresses
CD133 expression by directly binding to the CD133 P1
promoter. We found that Ikaros induced the differentiation
of CD133+ cancer stem-like cells. Thus, we concluded
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that inhibition of the stemness property of CSCs was
one functional role of Ikaros in HCC. Ikaros protein was
partially localized to the cytoplasm of HCC samples
and HCC cells (Figure 6A and Supplementary S5A
and B). Wild-type Ikaros localized in the nucleus after
forced Ikaros expression in HCC cells (Supplementary
Figure S6A). This result indicated that the subcellular
localization of Ikaros in HCC was important for its
function. In addition, 157 phenylalanine, 162 arginine,
10629

Oncotarget

and 184 arginine are necessary for Ikaros DNA binding
activity and subcellular localization [26]. Mutant Ikaros
could not localize to the nucleus and could not regulate
CD133 expression when these three amino acids were
mutated to alanine (Supplementary Figure S6B and C).
However, part of the Ikaros was found to be subcellular
localized in the cytoplasm of HCC as assessed by IHC.
Altered localization of Ikaros may be difficult to act
as a transcription factor in HCC cells, which requires
confirmation in future studies.
In present study, we found that pETS1 was higher
in HCC samples than their matched noncancerous liver
specimens, and there is no difference in ETS1 expression.
Although Ito et al reported that ETS1 was over-expressed
in HCC [41]. Cowley et al reported that the p-ETS1 is
the inhibitory form of ETS1 activity [30], therefore, we
consider that phosphorylation modification is critical
for ETS1 function and its activity in HCC samples. We
also found that HCC samples Ito et al detected are HCC
patients with hepatitis virus C (HCV), however, the HCC
samples we used are HCC patients with hepatitis virus
B (HBV). This different pathogens may result in the
discrepancy of ETS1 expression between our data and
that of Ito et al.
In this study, we confirmed that CtBP could interact
with Ikaros as a complex, and repressed CD133 protein
expression in HCC. CtBP, as a transcription repressor,
plays important roles in multiples of cancers. CtBP1
interacted with Ikaros in pituitary tumor cells, and
modulated their survival in response to hypoxia [42].
CtBP also by binding with p19Arf can inhibit the invasion
of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [43] and decrease the
sensitivity of breast cancer cells to mechanistically diverse
cancer chemotherapeutic agents via p53-dependent and
-independent roles [44]. In colon carcinomas, high levels
of Zeb1 and CtBP were correlated with low levels of
E-cadherin [45]. CtBP also drived the EMT, stem cell
pathways and genome instability in breast cancer [46].
Usually, CtBP interacts with other transcription factors
regulated the expression of down-stream genes. CtBP and
PRDM16 co-control the brown and white fat-selective
gene programs [47]. And in leukemic transformation of
hematopoietic cells, Evi-1 interacted with CtBP [48] and
repressed the transforming growth factor beta signaling
[49]. Importantly, CtBP contributed to the activities of
oncogenes Hdm2, Znf217, and multiple drug resistance
genes MDR1 [50, 51, 52]. CtBP interacted with other
transcription factors as complex, inhibited down-stream
genes expression. In addition, CtBP might participate in
multiples of biological process and interacted with other
corepressors in HCC. In present study, Ikaros was one
partner we determined in HCC. CtBP-Ikaros complex
functioned as a transcription repression complex and
inhibited CD133 expression. Other function of CtBP is
needed to be explored in future.
In summary, we provide evidence that Ikaros acts as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a transcription repressor in HCC, and our results indicate
that Ikaros may be a potential target for anticancer therapy
of HCC by enhancing its activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, and 293T cells were all
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). Huh7 cells were obtained from
the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). SMMC-7721
cells were provided by the Cell Bank of the Institute
of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, China Academy of
Sciences (Shanghai, China). MHCC-LM3 cells were
provided by the Liver Cancer Institute of Zhongshan
Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). HCC-LY5
cells were established from a human primary HCC tissue
in our lab.

Cell culture
All cell lines used in this study were cultured in
DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% bovine
serum (Hyclone), penicillin (500 U/ml), and streptomycin
(500 μg/ml) and were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. For
the differentiation-inducing assay of CSCs in vitro, HCC
cells were plated in six-well plates (NUNC, USA) in a
monolayer culture with serum-free chemically defined
medium (CDM). The CDM consisted of DMEDM/F12
supplemented with 0.5 × B27 supplements, 10 ng /ml
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Millipore), 10
ng epithelial growth factor (EGF) (Millipore), 500 U/ml
penicillin, and 500 μg /ml streptomycin.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
performed in HCC-LY5, SMMC-7721, and MHCCLM3 cells. The cells were cross-linked with 10%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C, and crosslinking
was reversed with 1 M glycine for 5 min at 37°C. After
washing with 1× PBS buffer, the cells were harvested
in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo
Scientific) for 5 min on ice and centrifuged at 2,000 g for
5 min. The precipitants were suspended in nuclei lysis
buffer, and the DNA was shredded into fragments of 1,000
base pairs by sonication. Antibodies against Ikaros, CtBP
and ETS1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using protein G
agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added and incubated
overnight at 4°C. After reversing the crosslinks, the DNA
was isolated and used for polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis. Primers for quantitative PCR (qPCR) are

Plasmid constructs, lentivirus production, and cell
transfection
Full-length human Ikaros (Origene) was subcloned
into pWPXL (Addgene) at the BamH I and EcoR II sites.
The CD133 full-length and deletion reporter constructs
were generated and cloned into a pGL3-enhancer vector
(Promega) at the Kpn I and Hind III sites. Three Ikaros
single DNA binding sites mutants (K137A, R162A, and
R184A) were generated using the megaprimer PCR
method as previously described [39]. Virus packaging and
cell transfection were performed as previously described
[40]. Primers for cloning are provided in Supplementary
Table 3.

Co-immunoprecipitation
Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed
using HCC-LY5, SMMC-7721, and MHCC-LM3
cells. After washing with 1× PBS buffer, the cells were
harvested in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent
(Thermo Scientific) for 5 min on ice and were centrifuged
at 2,000 g for 5 min. The precipitants were suspended in
RIPA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) lysis buffer for 50 min
on ice and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 15 min. Antibodies
against Ikaros and CtBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with
protein G agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added and
incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, the complexes
were subjected to western blot analysis.

at 4°C in a humidified chamber. The glass slides were
then washed three times in PBS and incubated in Alexa
594-conjugated secondary antibody and 4’6-diamino2-phenylindole (DAPI) in blocking solution for 40 min
at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Images were obtained
with a confocal laser microscope (IX-70, Olympus 40M,
Olympus, London, UK).

Six to eight-week-old BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were
randomly divided into groups and inoculated with the
suspended HCC cells (5×106 Huh7 cells, 5×103 CD133+
or CD133- HCC cells were inoculated into the mice).
At the end of the experimental period, the animals were
sacrificed. Immediately after killing, xenograft tumors
were weighed and fixed in neutral buffered formalin.
Fixed tumor tissues were analyzed using western blotting
analyses.

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded tissue array sections (5μm
in thickness) were prepared and immunodetections
were detected by immunofluorescence according to
the procedures described previously [6]. The results
were visualized and photographed under an Axioskop 2
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a
DP70 CCD system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Patients
One hundred and two human HCC tissue
samples were obtained from patients who underwent
surgical treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of
Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China), the Qidong
Liver Cancer Institute (Qidong, China) or the Guangxi
Cancer Institute (Nanning, China). The 102 HCC
patients included 84 males and 18 females (mean age:
52.21 years, ranging from 30 to 76 years). None of the
patients received chemotherapy or other treatment before
surgery. All procedures were performed under consensus
agreements and in accordance with the China Ethical
Review Committee. All tissue samples were fixed in 4%
phosphate-buffered neutral formalin for at least 72 hr and
routinely embedded in paraffin.

Plate colony formation assay
Two thousand cells were seeded into six-well culture
plates and fixed seven days later using 10% formaldehyde
for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were stained using GIEMSA
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37°C. After washing, the
cells cell colonies were quantified.

MTT
Three thousand cells were seeded into 96-well
culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Next, 100 μL MTT
(5 mg /ml) was added to each well. Cells were incubated
for 4 h at 37°C. The media was removed, and 100 μL
DMSO was added in the dark for 2 h at 37°C. The OD
was recorded at an absorbance of 570 nm.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
13.0 software. The results were presented as the mean ±
SD and compared using Student’s t test. Survival analysis
was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical
computations were performed using GraphPad Prism
version 5.0. p<0.05 was considered significant. *p < 0.05;
**p<0.01.

Fluorescence activated cell sorting
Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, HCC-LY5, and SMMC7721 cells were incubated with a PE-conjugated
CD133/1(AC133) antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany)
and sorted into CD133+ and CD133- cell subpopulations
on an Epics Altra flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA)
