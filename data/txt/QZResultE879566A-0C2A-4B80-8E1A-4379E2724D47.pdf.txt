Abstract
EphA2, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, is
commonly expressed by a broad range of cancer types, where
its level of (over)expression correlates with poor clinical
outcome. Because tumor cell expressed EphA2 is a nonmutated ‘‘self ’’ protein, specific CD8+ T cells are subject to
self-tolerance mechanisms and typically exhibit only moderateto-low functional avidity, rendering them marginally competent to recognize EphA2+ tumor cells in vitro or in vivo. We have
recently reported that the ability of specific CD8+ T cells to
recognize EphA2+ tumor cells can be augmented after the
cancer cells are pretreated with EphA2 agonists that promote
proteasomal degradation and up-regulated expression of
EphA2/class I complexes on the tumor cell membrane. In the
current study, we show that treatment of EphA2+ tumor cells
with the irreversible heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, 17dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17DMAG), similarly enhances their recognition by EphA2-specific
CD8+ T-cell lines and clones in vitro via a mechanism that is
dependent on proteasome and transporter-associated protein
function as well as the retrotranslocation of EphA2 into the
tumor cytoplasm. When 17-DMAG and agonist anti-EphA2
monoclonal antibodies are coapplied, T-cell recognition of
tumor cells is further increased over that observed for either
agent alone. These studies suggest that EphA2 represents a
novel heat shock protein 90 client protein and that the
treatment of cancer patients with 17-DMAG–based ‘‘pulse’’
therapy may improve the antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T effector
cells reactive against EphA2-derived epitopes. [Cancer Res
2009;69(17):6995–7003]

Introduction
EphA2, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family of
molecules, is a 130-kDa (type I) glycoprotein that mediates
intercellular interactions via binding to its ligands ephrin A1, A3,
A4, and A5 expressed on an opposing cell surface (1). This receptor
tyrosine kinase is expressed at low levels on a broad range of
epithelial tissues in normal adults, including lung, spleen, kidney,
and liver (2), where it is primarily localized to sites of cell-to-cell
contact and plays a role in contact inhibition of cell growth/

migration that is critical for the organization and formation of
epithelial layers in EphA2+ tissues (3). In addition to epithelial cells,
activated endothelial cells also express EphA2 in association with
tissue neovascularization in adults (4).
In contrast to nontransformed cells, EphA2 is commonly
overexpressed in a range of cancer types, including melanoma
and many carcinomas (5–12), where it serves as an oncoprotein
and a facilitator of metastasis (3, 13). Clinical observations suggest
that the level of EphA2 overexpression by tumor cells is an
indicator of poor prognosis, because it has been linked to reduced
time to disease recurrence and enhanced disease progression and
metastatic spread (7, 9, 14, 15).
As a consequence, EphA2 represents an attractive target for
therapeutic intervention in the majority of patients with solid
tumors, with several treatment strategies considered for translation
into the clinic. One strategy involves the implementation of agents
[agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb) or recombinant ligands] that
promote the proteasome-mediated degradation of tumor EphA2
protein, thereby limiting its oncogenic function (16, 17). We have
recently determined that such reagents also promote a corollary
enhancement in tumor cell presentation of EphA2 peptides in
tumor cell MHC class I complexes, thereby facilitating tumor cell
recognition and eradication by low-to-modest avidity CD8+ T cells
(18). Because EphA2-specific CD8+ T cells have been detected in the
peripheral blood of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC; ref. 8),
prostate carcinoma (19), or glioma (20), and the frequencies of
these protective T cells would be anticipated to be augmented as a
consequence of active vaccination (2, 21), combinational therapies
that sensitize EphA2+ tumors for specific CD8+ T-cell eradication
may yield enhanced clinical benefits in the cancer setting (22).
Interestingly, many receptor tyrosine kinase serve as client
proteins for the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90
(HSP90),5 a protein designed to stabilize and refold denatured
proteins into their native conformations to preserve their function
and utility in normal and stressed cells (23). HSP90 is commonly
overexpressed in tumor cells, where it is believed to protect client
oncogenic/survival proteins that support tumor progression and
metastasis, in part, by preventing their proteasome-dependent
destruction (24). Our current report suggests that EphA2 represents
a previously unknown HSP90 client protein. Furthermore, treatment of tumor cells with 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a well-tolerated clinical inhibitor
of HSP90 (24, 25), results in the proteasome-dependent degradation
of tumor EphA2 and in augmented tumor cell recognition by antiEphA2 CD8+ T cells in vitro.

Cell lines and media. SLR20 (EphA2 , HLA-A2 ; ref. 8), SLR22 (EphA2 ,
HLA-A2+; ref. 8), and SKOV3 (EphA2+, HLA-A2 ; kindly provided by Dr. Nora
Disis, University of Washington) as well as the SLR20.A2 (EphA2+, HLA-A2+)
and SKOV3.A2 (EphA2+, HLA-A2+) cell lines (established via transduction of
the corresponding parental cell lines with a recombinant retrovirus
encoding HLA-A2.1 provided by Dr. Peter Cresswell, Yale University; ref.
18) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and
10 mmol/L L-glutamine (all reagents from Invitrogen unless otherwise
indicated). All cell lines were free of Mycoplasma contamination.
HSP90 inhibitor and peptides. HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG (NSC 707545)
was obtained by National Cancer Institute. Lyophilized 17-DMAG was
dissolved in sterile water as stock solution and diluted with RPMI 1640
before use. HLA-A2 presented EphA2 peptides EphA258-66 (IMNDMPIYM;
ref. 19) and EphA2883-891 (TLADFDPRV; ref. 8) were synthesized using 9fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry by University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute Peptide Synthesis Facility as described previously (18). The purity
of peptides was >96% based on high-performance liquid chromatography,
with peptide identity validated by tandem mass spectrometric analyses
done by the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Protein Sequencing
Facility (a shared resource). The ICP471-35 and ICP4735-1 synthetic peptides
(26) were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Cresswell.
Western blot. RCC cell lines at 80% to 90% confluency were incubated
with 17-DMAG (10-1,000 nmol/L) in 2% human serum-supplemented
RPMI 1640 for 24 to 48 h. To assess the effect of proteasome function,

endosomal acidification, and retrotranslocation in EphA2 protein
degradation promoted by the HSP90 inhibitor, MG-132 (5-10 Amol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich), chloroquine (30-100 Amol/L; Sigma-Aldrich), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ExoA; 10-50 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich),
respectively, were added at the initiation of 24 h tumor cell cultures as
indicated in individual experiments. Harvested cells were then incubated
with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% NP-40 in
PBS; all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich) containing a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Complete mini; Roche Diagnostic) for 30 min at 4jC. Lysates were
cleared by centrifugation at 13,500  g for 10 min, and proteins in the lysate
were resolved by SDS-PAGE before electroblotting onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore). Polyclonal anti-EphA2 antibody and
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (both from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to detect EphA2. mAbs against
transporter-activated protein (TAP)–1 and TAP-2 (NOB-1 and NOB-2,
respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. Soldano Ferrone, University of
Pittsburgh), with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used to probe blots. Probed proteins were
visualized by Western Lighting chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer) and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak) for 1 to 5 min.
Flow cytometry. Control or treated RCC cells were harvested with
trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), washed, and then incubated with anti-EphA2
mAb (B2D6; Upstate Biologicals) or anti-pan class I mAb (W6/32; Serotec)
for 30 min at 4jC. After washing with PBS/0.2% bovine serum albumin/
0.02% NaN3, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (MP

17-DMAG Enhances EphA2+ Tumor Cell Recognition

Figure 2. Recognition of EphA2+ SLR20.A2 tumor cells by bulk anti-EphA2 CD8+ T cells is enhanced after treatment with 17-DMAG. A, HLA-A2–restricted CD8+
T cells were generated in vitro by repeated stimulation with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with the EphA258-66 or EphA2883-891 peptide epitopes. These bulk CD8+
T cells were then cocultured with the EphA2+, HLA-A2+ SLR22 RCC line alone (black columns ) or in the presence of blocking anti-class I mAb W6/32 (gray columns )
for 24 h at 37jC in IFN-g ELISPOT assays. B, SLR20 (EphA2+, HLA-A2 ; light gray columns ) or SLR20.A2 (EphA2+, HLA-A2+; black columns ) cells were
cultured in the absence or presence of 500 nmol/L 17-DMAG for 24 or 48 h before analysis of these target cells in IFN-g ELISPOT assays. Bulk anti-EphA258-66
or anti-EphA2883-891 CD8+ T-cell lines were used as responder cells. *, P < 0.05 for all indicated comparisons. Mean F SD of triplicate determinations from a single

Biomedicals) for 30 min at 4jC. Cells were washed twice and then analyzed
using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Isotype control mAb was
mIgG1 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Proteasome function analysis. SLR20 cells were transfected with the
proteasome sensor vector (PSV; BD Biosciences) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) and selected in cultures containing G418 (Invitrogen), thus
generating SLR20.PSV cells. PSV expresses a fluorescent substrate for
the proteasome (26), which accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells if
proteasome function is inhibited. SLR20.PSV cells were grown to 80%
to 90% confluency before being cultured in the absence or presence of
17-DMAG or the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich) or PS-341
(bortezomib; kindly provided by Dr. Ram Ganapathi, Cleveland Clinic
Foundation) at the indicated concentrations for 24 h at 37jC and 5% CO2
tension. Fluorescence was detected in the FITC bandwidth (488 nm) by
flow cytometry.
T-cell lines and clones. Bulk CD8+ T-cell lines and clones specific for
EphA258-66 or EphA2883-891 were generated as described previously (18).
Briefly, mature dendritic cells were developed from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (obtained with written consent under an institutional
review board–approved protocol) isolated from normal HLA-A2+ donors in
7-day cultures containing recombinant human granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (Sargramostim; Amgen) and recombinant human
interleukin-4 (Peprotech) and then pulsed with either the EphA258-66
or EphA2883-891 peptides (10 Amol/L) for 4 h at 37jC at 5% CO2
tension. Autologous CD8+ T cells were stimulated on a weekly basis with
peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells for three to four cycles (at a
T cells-to-dendritic cells ratio of 10:1) to generate a bulk population of
peptide-specific CD8+ T cells. These T cells were used in tumor recognition
assays and for cloning via limiting dilution assays (18). T cells were
maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with
10% human AB serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin,
10 mmol/L L-glutamine, and MEM nonessential amino acids (all reagents
from Invitrogen, except human AB serum, which was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich). After their initial isolation, T-cell clones were expanded
in vitro in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with
1 Ag/mL phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 units/mL recombinant human interleukin-2 (Peprotech).
Tumor recognition assays. Tumor recognition by anti-EphA2 T cells
was evaluated by IFN-g ELISPOT assays as described before (8, 18) or using

www.aacrjournals.org

a commercial human IFN-g ELISA (BD Biosciences). For both ELISPOT and
ELISA protocols, tumor cells were treated with 100 to 500 nmol/L 17-DMAG
and/or 1 Ag/mL anti-EphA2 mAb208 (18) for 24 to 48 h before their harvest
using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). After washing with PBS (Invitrogen),
tumor cells were cocultured with anti-EphA2 T-cell lines/clones at an
E:T cell ratio of 1:1 for 24 h at 37jC and 5% CO2 tension. In some assays,
where indicated, the class I–restricted nature of CD8+ T-cell recognition of
tumor cells was assessed by inclusion of 10 Ag/well W6/32 (pan HLA-class I)
mAb. To assess the effect of proteasome function, TAP function, endosomal
acidification, and retrotranslocation on 17-DMAG–treated tumor cells by
anti-EphA2 CD8+ T cells, MG-132 (10 Amol/L), ICP471-35 peptide (10 Ag/mL),
chloroquine (100 Amol/L), or P. aeruginosa ExoA (10-50 Ag/mL),
respectively, were added to tumor cells during the 24 h treatment period.
As a negative control for the ICP471-35 peptide in these studies, the
‘‘reverse’’, scrambled ICP4735-1 peptide (27) was used at a concentration of
10 mg/mL. After harvest, tumor cells were washed twice with PBS before
using these cells as targets for T-cell recognition.
Statistical analyses. Two-tailed Student’s t tests were used to
evaluate the difference between groups, with P values < 0.05 considered
significant.

Results
HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG induces EphA2 degradation that
may be blocked by inhibitors of proteasome function but not
endosomal acidification. The EphA2 (over)expressing RCC cell
line SLR20 was incubated in the absence or presence of 17-DMAG
(0-1,000 nmol/L) for 24 to 48 h. The resultant cells were then
analyzed for EphA2 protein levels by Western blotting (total
protein; Fig. 1A) and flow cytometry (cell surface protein; Fig. 1B).
In both cases, tumor EphA2 levels were reduced at both 24 and
48 h post-treatment with 17-DMAG treatment (IC50 f250 nmol/L),
although the pool of EphA2 protein most sensitive to 17-DMAG
effects may be intracellular given the somewhat greater degree of
reduction noted in the Western blotting–based versus flow
cytometry–based assays. Inclusion of the proteasome inhibitor
MG-132 blocked the ability of 17-DMAG to promote EphA2 protein

Figure 3. 17-DMAG promotes enhanced recognition of the EphA2+, HLA-A2+ ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3.A2 in vitro. A, SKOV3.A2 tumor cells were analyzed for
expression of cell surface HLA-A2 and EphA2 proteins by flow cytometry using specific mAbs (open histograms ) versus isotype control mAbs (filled histograms ).
To assess the effect of HSP90 inhibition, SKOV3.A2 tumor cells were untreated or treated with 17-DMAG (10-1,000 nmol/L) for 24 h and analyzed for EphA2 expression
by flow cytometry (B) and Western blotting (C ) as well as for their ability to be recognized by bulk anti-EphA258-66 T cells (D ). In the flow cytometry analyses, P = 0.001

period [T cells (105)-tumor cells (104) F 500 nmol/L 17-DMAG pretreatment] and analyzed for IFN-g content by specific ELISA. EphA258-66 peptide-pulsed control

loss (Fig. 1C), suggesting that HSP90 effects on EphA2 are at least
partially proteasome-dependent. In contrast, inclusion of chloroquine, which disrupts endosomal acidification (28), failed to affect
17-DMAG–induced degradation of EphA2 protein (Fig. 1C). Single
and combinational (17-DMAG + inhibitors) drug treatments did
not lead to tumor cell death based on retention of control h-actin
signal in the Western blot experiments and appropriate forward/
side scatter gating profiles in the flow cytometry assays (Fig. 1; data
not shown).
Treatment of tumor cells with HSP90 inhibitor does not
significantly alter major components of the tumor MHC class I
antigen processing machinery. Because our ultimate goal was to
discern potential augmentation in immune recognition of EphA2+
tumor cells after treatment with 17-DMAG, we next assessed the
effect of drug treatment on the expression and/or function of
components of tumor cell MHC class I antigen processing
machinery (APM). Proteasome activity was analyzed using a model
employing SLR20 cells transfected with a PSV (SLR20.PSV cells), in
which intracellular fluorescent protein accumulates when protea-

some function is inhibited. As depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1A,
the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and PS-341 both increased the
fluorescence of SLR20.PSV cells, whereas 17-DMAG had minimum
effect even after 48 h at concentrations in excess of that required to
promote EphA2 degradation (as shown in Fig. 1). TAP levels (both
TAP-1 and TAP2) were next analyzed by Western blot and were also
shown to be unaffected by 17-DMAG treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Finally, tumor cell surface MHC class I levels were shown
to be unaltered by 17-DMAG as assessed by flow cytometry using a
pan-class I–reactive mAb (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These results
suggest that 17-DMAG does not have a deleterious effect on tumor
cell MHC class I/peptide complex generation and corollary
expression of such complexes on the tumor cell surface.
17-DMAG treatment of tumor cells transiently enhances
tumor recognition by bulk CD8+ T cells specific for EphA2. Bulk
CD8+ T-cell lines and clones reactive against EphA2 were generated
from normal HLA-A2+ donors using an in vitro stimulation
protocol employing autologous dendritic cells pulsed either
EphA258-66 or EphA2883-891 (HLA-A2–presented) peptide epitopes

17-DMAG Enhances EphA2+ Tumor Cell Recognition

as stimulator cells. After two or three rounds of identical
restimulation, responder CD8+ T cells were assessed for recognition
of RCC cell lines (control or 17-DMAG pretreated) in IFN-g
ELISPOT assays. As shown in Fig. 2, bulk peptide-primed CD8+
T cells recognized EphA2+, HLA-A2+ RCC lines [SLR22 (Fig. 2A) and
SLR20.A2 (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2)] in a manner that was
class I–restricted (inhibited by W6/32 mAb; Fig. 2A). These same
T-cell lines reacted poorly against the EphA2+ but HLA-A2 SLR20
cell line (Fig. 2B). When SLR20.A2 was pretreated with 17-DMAG
for 24 h before coculture with bulk (and cloned) T cells reactive
against either of the EphA2 peptides, tumor cell recognition by
T cells was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05; Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Fig. S2B). However, this enhanced immune recognition was
transient in nature, because tumor cells pretreated for 48 h with
17-DMAG were recognized to a degree that was comparable with
untreated tumor cells (Fig. 2B).
To determine whether 17-DMAG could sensitize tumor cells of
an alternate lineage to anti-EphA2 CD8+ T-cell recognition, we
treated SKOV3.A2 ovarian carcinoma cells (EphA2+, HLA-A2+;
Fig. 3A) with 17-DMAG for 24 h in vitro. Analogous to the results
obtained for SLA20.A2 tumor cells, 17-DMAG (500 nmol/L)–treated
SKOV3.A2 cells displayed reduced EphA2 protein expression
(versus control untreated tumor cells) as monitored by flow
cytometry (Fig. 3B) and Western blotting (Fig. 3C). Furthermore,
anti-EphA258-66 bulk CD8+ T cells exhibited enhanced recognition
of 17-DMAG–treated SKOV3.A2, but not parental SKOV3 (EphA2+,
HLA-A2 ), tumor cells (Fig. 3D). Such recognition was MHC class
I–restricted in nature based on the inhibitory effects associated

with inclusion of mAb W6/32 during the coculture period (Fig. 3D).
Because the ability of 17-DMAG to promote EphA2 degradation in
tumor cells was inhibited by MG-132 but not by chloroquine, we
next evaluated the effect of these agents on anti-EphA2 CD8+ T-cell
recognition of HSP90 inhibitor–treated tumor cells. As shown in
Fig. 3E , enhanced T-cell recognition of 17-DMAG–treated
SKOV3.A2 cells was effectively ablated by the proteasome inhibitor
but not by the lysosomotropic drug (chloroquine). Notably, MG-132
also reduced basal recognition of SKOV3.A2 cells by anti-EphA2
T cells (Fig. 3E), supporting that the normal loading of tumor cell
class I complexes with EphA2 peptides occurs via a proteasomedependent pathway.
17-DMAG treatment of tumor cells enhances tumor recognition by a low-avidity CD8+ T-cell clone specific for EphA2 via
a retrotranslocation- and TAP-dependent mechanism. Because
17-DMAG promotes enhanced recognition by CD8+ T cells capable
of recognizing peptides derived from both extracellular (EphA258-66)
and intracellular (EphA2883-891) domains of this receptor tyrosine
kinase, this suggests that both domains of this transmembrane
protein must become accessible for proteasomal processing into
peptides that are then conveyed via TAP into the endoplasmic
reticulum for loading in nascent HLA-A2 complexes in tumor cells.
Current paradigms (29–31) suggest that cytosolic access for the
extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins may be accomplished through a retrotranslocation process involving sec61dependent ‘‘ratcheting’’ of the target protein into the cytoplasm
where it may become a substrate for the proteasome. To test this
hypothesis, we added the sec61 inhibitor ExoA (27) to tumor cells

then analyzed for expression of EphA2 versus control h-actin protein by Western blotting. B, untreated SLR20 cells (light gray columns ) or SL20.A2 cells

Figure 5. Superior in vitro recognition of the SLR20.A2 tumor cells by anti-EphA2 CD8+ T cells after combined treatment with 17-DMAG and agonistic anti-EphA2
mAb208. A, SLR20.A2 cells were untreated or treated for 24 h with 17-DMAG (100 nmol/L) F 1 Ag/mL mAb208 or control IgG (cIgG), after which cells were
washed and analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of cell surface EphA2 molecules. Data in parentheses represent the MFI value for each cell population analyzed.
Representative of one of four independent assays. P < 0.05 for differences in the MFI between all cohorts in pairwise comparisons. B, SLR20.A2 cells were
untreated or treated with 17-DMAG (100-1,000 nmol/L) F control IgG (1 Ag/mL) or agonist anti-EphA2 mAb208 (1 Ag/mL) for 24 h. After harvest, cells were lysed
in Triton X-100–containing buffer. After centrifugation, the soluble lysate and pellet were recovered and analyzed via Western blotting for comparative levels of EphA2.
h-Actin or MHC class I heavy chain proteins served as control proteins. C and D, SLR20 control cells (light gray columns ) or SLR20.A2 (black columns) tumor cells

during culture with 17-DMAG before their analysis in Western
blotting and T-cell assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, ExoA inhibits 17DMAG–induced degradation of tumor cell EphA2 protein. Notably,
ExoA also prevents enhanced recognition of SLR20.A2 tumor cells
by anti-EphA2 (clone 15/9) CD8+ T cells after 24 h treatment with
17-DMAG (Fig. 4B and C) but does not negatively affect the
recognition of EphA2 peptide-pulsed tumor cells (Fig. 4B). Similar
results were obtained using a bulk anti-EphA258-66 CD8+ T-cell line
and the SKOV3.A2 tumor cell line (Fig. 3E).
The dependence of the anti-EphA2 T-cell sensitizing effects of
17-DMAG on tumor cell TAP function was next addressed. We
observed that cotreatment of tumor cells with 17-DMAG and a
NH2-terminal fragment of the ICP47 protein (ICP471-35), a (Herpes
simplex) viral inhibitor of TAP (27), ablated enhanced T-cell
recognition when compared with tumor cells treated with 17DMAG alone (P < 0.05). This effect was specific, as inclusion of a
scrambled peptide ICP35-1 (bearing the reverse AA sequence of
ICP471-35) exhibited no such inhibitory effect (Fig. 4C).

Combined treatment of EphA2+, HLA-A2+ tumor cells with
both 17-DMAG and agonist (anti-EphA2) mAb208 results in
superior recognition by a low-avidity CD8+ T cells specific for
EphA2. As we have reported previously that EphA2 agonist
mAb208 promotes the proteasomal destruction of tumor EphA2
protein and enhances specific CD8+ T-cell recognition of treated
tumor cells (18), we next investigated whether the combined use of
both 17-DMAG and mAb208 would result in an even greater degree
of tumor cell recognition by specific T cells when compared with
either treatment modality alone. SLR20.A2 cells were cultured for
24 h in the absence or presence of 17-DMAG F mAb208 or control
IgG, with IFN-g ELISPOT assays subsequently done using the 15/9
CD8+ T-cell clone and a bulk anti-EphA2883-891 CD8+ T-cell line. As
depicted in Fig. 5A and B, whereas both 17-DMAG and mAb208
treatment resulted in reduced EphA2 expression on SLR20.A2 cells,
combined treatment with both reagents yielded an even greater
degree of EphA2 protein loss. T-cell assays similarly support the
greatest degree of tumor cell recognition by CD8+ T cells (targeting

Discussion
Immunotherapies (including cancer vaccines) designed to
stimulate specific T-cell–mediated immunity have thus far yielded
rather modest objective clinical response rates despite their ability
to enhance circulating frequencies of tumor-specific T cells in
many treated patients (32). Because most tumor-associated
antigens are nonmutated (‘‘self ’’) proteins, treatment-enhanced
T cells are believed to be derived from a low-to-moderate avidity
repertoire that has survived negative selection (33, 34). These
T cells may become effectively activated by (peptide-based)
vaccines, but they frequently fail to recognize tumor cells that
naturally present low stochastic frequencies of relevant MHC/tumor
peptide complexes (35). Poor immune reactivity of tumor cells may
be further exacerbated by defects in the tumor APM (36, 37).
If tolerance selection restricts the antitumor CD8+ T-cell
repertoire to a degree that limits their clinical utility, we
hypothesized that tumor cells might instead be manipulated to
exceed the cognate antigen threshold requirements for effective
immune surveillance. In particular, we believe that by conditionally
enhancing the proteasomal processing of tumor antigens, such as
EphA2, the level of class I/EphA2 peptide complexes might be (at
least transiently) increased on the tumor cell surface, allowing for
improved recognition by modest avidity anti-EphA2 CD8+ T cells
(22). Indeed, in the current study, we have determined that (a)
EphA2, which is commonly overexpressed in a broad range of
cancer types, is a novel client protein of HSP90 and that HSP90
inhibitors, such as 17-DMAG, promote tumor cell EphA2
degradation; (b) 17-DMAG treatment of EphA2+ tumor (RCC and
ovarian carcinoma) cells improves recognition by low-avidity antiEphA2 CD8+ T cells; (c) enhanced T-cell recognition of 17-DMAG–
treated tumor cells is MHC-dependent and appears unrelated to
tumor cell expression of costimulatory/coinhibitory molecules,
which remains unchanged on HSP90 antagonism (Supplementary
Fig. S3); and (d) EphA2+ tumor cell recognition by specific CD8+
T cells may be further enhanced by combined treatment with
17-DMAG and EphA2 agonists (versus treatment with either single
modality).
Notably, tumor recognition by T cells reactive against peptides
found in the extracellular (EphA258-66) as well as intracellular
(EphA2883-891) domains of the target protein was improved by
treatment with 17-DMAG. This suggests the superior processing/
presentation of peptides derived from the full-length, transmembrane protein may be anticipated as a consequence of drug
application. Mechanistically, we observed that enhanced T-cell
recognition of 17-DMAG–conditioned tumor cells was ablated
on inclusion of proteasome (MG-132), TAP (ICP471-35), or sec61
(P. aeruginosa ExoA) inhibitors. In contrast, there was minimal
effect associated with the inclusion of the lysosomotropic agent
chloroquine, which interferes with endosomal acidification and
lysosomal processing of protein antigens. These data suggest that
the major pool of EphA2 protein undergoing (constitutive as
well as) enhanced proteasomal processing as a consequence of
17-DMAG inhibition likely enters the tumor cytosol via a retrotranslocation event (27, 29–31). At present, we cannot distinguish
whether this pool of EphA2 protein derives from an early
endosomal compartment (internalized after interaction with the

www.aacrjournals.org

EphA2 ligands coexpressed by adjacent tumor cells that is
unaffected by chloroquine) and/or from newly synthesized,
misfolded EphA2 proteins within the exocytic pathway. However,
given the observed quantitative variance in 17-DMAG–induced
EphA2 degradation as imaged using flow cytometry versus Western
blotting analyses, and the apparent synergy of agonist mAb208 and
17-DMAG in promoting EphA2 protein loss and enhanced T-cell
recognition, it could be suggested that mAb208 primarily affects
the membrane pool of EphA2 protein, whereas 17-DMAG primarily
affects the intracellular pool of this protein. In either case,
derivative EphA2 peptides would then appear to be integrated
into ‘‘empty’’ class I complexes after TAP-dependent transfer into
the MHC class I loading compartment.
Although several HSP90 inhibitors (including geldanamycin, 17allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin, and 17-DMAG) have now
entered advanced clinical trials, to our knowledge, very few articles
have addressed the potential effects of HSP90 inhibitors on tumor
cell recognition by T cells. In this regard, Castilleja and colleagues
reported that the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin induced degradation of nonmutated HER-2/neu in a treated ovarian carcinoma cell
line, resulting in enhanced recognition by a HLA-A2–restricted CTL
line reactive against the HER-2/neu 369-377 epitope (38). They also
noted that the level of HLA-A2 class I molecules expressed by their
tumor cell line was increased after treatment (38). Although this
latter result is somewhat in contrast to our current results, the
mechanistic paradigm(s) for HSP90 inhibitor effects on immune
augmentation appear consistent in the two studies. In marked
contrast, Callahan and colleagues reported that H-2Ld expression
was reduced on cells treated with HSP90 inhibitors radicicol,
geldanamycin, or 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin due to
the inhibited loading of peptides into MHC class I complexes and
that radicicol treatment of SV40 large T antigen–expressing SVB6
cells impaired their recognition by an anti-T antigen T-cell clone
(K11; ref. 39). However, the doses of HSP90 inhibitors used by these
investigators were high compared with those used (50 and 16
times) in our study and by Castilleja and colleagues (38),
respectively. Such drug excess could result in adverse effects at
the level of the tumor cell APM or in the expression of alternate
integrins/adhesion molecules required for cognate T-cell recognition. Moreover, although T antigen may interact with HSP90, its
degradation is only modestly induced by HSP90 inhibitors (40),
which could limit the pool of derivative T antigen peptides for the
consequent loading of MHC class I complexes required for specific
T-cell reactivity to occur.
Our data suggest that 17-DMAG enhances tumor cell recognition
by EphA2-specific CD8+ T cells in a transient manner, with
improved recognition observed 24 h, but not 48 h, after drug
treatment. This contrasts slightly with the inhibitory effects of 17DMAG on tumor EphA2 expression levels, which were comparable
or somewhat greater at 48 h versus 24 h. One possible explanation
for this dichotomy may involve differential rates at which the
diverse array of HSP90 client proteins undergo proteasomal
destruction on application of 17-DMAG.6 As a result, the
competitor substrates for proteasomal processing of EphA2 protein
may vary over time after drug treatment. If this hypothesis is
correct, EphA2 may be more efficiently processed and/or be less
effectively competed for loading MHC class I complexes during the

first 24 h of HSP90 inhibitor administration. In extended studies,
we noted that the ability of 17-DMAG–treated tumor cells to be
loaded by exogenous peptide was somewhat diminished when
compared with untreated tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S4) but
that this was not differential at the 24 h versus 48 h time points
post-DMAG application (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and that this did
not appear to reflect any change in the prevalence of ‘‘empty’’ HLAA2 complexes on the tumor cell surface as a consequence of drug
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4B). We interpret these results to
suggest that the average affinity of presented peptides (including
EphA2 epitopes) in tumor cell HLA-A2 (and corollary stability of
MHC complexes that limit loading of exogenous peptides) may be
increased as a consequence of 17-DMAG treatment ( for 24 or 48 h).
These findings appear to mitigate concerns that the class I APM
is substantially altered in tumor cells after extended treatment
(48 h versus 24 h) with HSP inhibitors, which could have logistically
prevented the sustained MHC presentation of EphA2 peptides.
It is also possible that ‘‘chronic’’ treatment of tumor cells with 17DMAG suppresses the production of EphA2 based on direct (or
indirect) effects on EphA2 transcription, etc. In this context,
activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway has been shown to enhance EphA2 transcription (41);
however, Raf is a client protein of HSP90.7 Hence, HSP90 inhibitors
may antagonize this signaling cascade (42) and consequently limit
EphA2 transcription by promoting Raf degradation. We are
currently in the process of analyzing such possibilities to establish
an optimal treatment regimen capable of improving tumor cell
presentation of EphA2 epitopes to the immune system.
Based on our current and recently published studies (18), both
EphA2 agonists (mAb, recombinant EphA1-Fc) and 17-DMAG
(alone or in combination) are capable of enhancing anti-EphA2
T-cell recognition of (EphA2+, HLA-A2+) tumor cell lines. In the
clinic, EphA2 agonists would be expected to be superior with
regard to specificity in targeting the EphA2 antigen versus multiple
client proteins in the case of HSP90 inhibitors. However, the
promiscuous and coordinate effects of HSP90 inhibitors on
multiple oncoprotein clients would argue for the use of these
drugs in combinational immunotherapies targeting multiple

antigens (such as EphA2, epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2/neu, etc.). HSP90 inhibitors may be preferred to agonists based
on their selective accumulation in tumor versus normal EphA2+
tissue sites. For example, 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin
binds to tumor cell-derived HSP90 up to 2 logs more tightly than it
does to normal cell-derived HSP90 (43). Furthermore, in mouse
models, 17-DMAG persists within tumor lesions far longer than in
normal tissues, with detectable levels selectively observed in
tumors 48 h after a single i.v. administration of drug (44). This
suggests that drug dosing far below the maximum tolerated dose
may be capable of modulating T-cell recognition of cancer cells
within the tumor microenvironment in vivo. However, it is also
possible that the application of 17-DMAG and/or EphA2 agonists
may promote increased immune recognition of normal EphA2+
tissues that express a fully functional class I APM. This raises the
specter of autoimmune pathology that would need to be closely
monitored in prospective clinical trials applying these agents,
particularly should they be combined. In this regard, no untoward
immune-mediated effects on patient EphA2+ organs (lungs and
kidney) have been reported in clinical trials employing HSP90
inhibitors to date (45), and EphA2 agonist therapies have yet to be
investigated in phase I trials.
In conclusion, our results suggest that an effective combinational
immunotherapy for clinical translation (22) may be defined by
‘‘pulse’’ 17-DMAG administration to improve EphA2+ tumor cell
recognition by CD8+ T cells that have been elicited previously in
response to EphA2-based vaccination or that are provided via
adoptive transfer. Such combinational approaches might be further
improved by inclusion of type I or II IFN coadministration to
further improve tumor cell APM function and the MHC class I (and
II) presentation of targeted epitopes by tumor cells in vivo (46, 47).
