BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative to local treatment for pulmonary metastases in
patients who are nonsurgical candidates. Based on previously documented efficacy of this treatment, the authors retrospectively studied the prognostic factors for long-term survival. METHODS: One hundred patients with unresectable colorectal pulmonary metastases underwent percutaneous RFA. Clinical and treatment variables were collected
and evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses with overall survival as the primary endpoint. RESULTS: At a
median follow-up period of 23 (range, 1 to 96) months from the time of RFA treatment, 49 patients have died. The
median overall survival after RFA treatment was 36 months and 5-year overall survival rates of 30%. Univariate analyses demonstrated that histopathological grade (p < .001), time to RFA treatment (p ¼ .017), response to treatment
(p < .001), repeat RFA treatments (p ¼ .001), presence of extrapulmonary metastases (p < .001), presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (p ¼ .007), and adjunct systemic chemotherapy (p < .001) were associated with overall survival. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that response to RFA treatment (p < .001), repeat RFA treatment (p ¼
.002), presence of extrapulmonary metastases (p ¼ .008), and use of adjunct systemic chemotherapy (p ¼ .05) were
independent predictors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation for colorectal pulmonary metastases
represents a step forward towards a nonsurgical option of combining systemic and local treatment for metastatic

The development of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer is often indicative of widespread disease. Patients
who are selected to undergo pulmonary metastasectomy represent only a small proportion of patients whose disease progression, response to systemic treatments, and lesion characteristics are favorable. Together with the liver, these 2 organs
represent the most common sites of visceral metastases from colorectal cancer. If left untreated, these patients with metastatic colorectal cancer uniformly die of disease progression and develop terminal disease rapidly with a median survival of
8 months and a 1-year survival of about 30%. With palliative 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based chemotherapy, the median
survival is 12 months, and the 1-year survival is 50%.1 Over the years, significant advancement in systemic treatment of
colorectal cancer through the combination of oxaliplatin (Eloxatin or Oxaliplatin Medac) and irinotecan (Camptosar,
CPT-11, Camptosar, or Campto) to fluorouracil (5-FU; Adrucil, Efudex, or Fluoroplex) and leucovorin-based therapies
has led to a significantly longer progression-free survival, with overall median survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer of all sites or lung reaching up to 17 months.2-5 Further survival benefits have been demonstrated through
the addition of targeted therapies that include bevacizumab (Avastin), cetuximab (Erbitux), and panitumumab (ABXEGF or Vectibix) to the combination regime with median survival reaching in excess of 20 months6-11 with distinct incremental benefits of these diverse regimens on progression-free survival.12
Nevertheless, responses to these modern-agent systemic therapies are not complete, and residual tumor cells remain
present within resolving lesions after chemotherapy.13,14 Surgery remains the only definitive treatment for cure. The

practice of pulmonary metastasectomy is evolving with a
large number of published series reporting the results of
surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal
cancer with a median 5-year survival of 48%.15 Despite
these encouraging survival results, there remains no consensus within the thoracic surgical community regarding
pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer, with
concerns for treatment-related morbidity, post-treatment
effect of loss of lung volume on quality of life, and the
optimal approach to resecting pulmonary metastases.16
These issues are likely to be resolved only through planned
randomized trials in the future.17
In nonsurgical candidates, radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) is an alternative to surgery for local treatment to
eradicate the tumor. Local treatment in the presence of
metastatic disease will only be justified when occult microscopic disease is addressed through effective systemic
therapy such that aggressive efforts aimed at eradicating
the macroscopic tumor are reasonable with demonstrable gains. On the basis of previously published data suggesting the efficacy of RFA for colorectal pulmonary
metastases,18 we retrospectively studied the prognostic
factors for long-term survival after treatment with a
focus on the use of systemic chemotherapy together
with RFA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
From November 2000, patients with unresectable pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer were evaluated at a
weekly multidisciplinary meeting that comprised a surgical oncologist, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist,
and interventional radiologist. Criteria that defined the
selection of patients for this study consisted of the following: patients aged between 18 and 85 years, patients with
colorectal pulmonary metastases who were not surgical
candidates (previously treated lung or liver metastases,
presence of more than 3 lesions identified in either lung,
bilateral pulmonary disease, or multiple lobar metastases,
and those patients who refused surgery), patients with
complete resection of primary colorectal tumor and any
other sites of metastases, and those patients who signed an
informed consent form. This study was approved by the
local institutional review board.
Exclusion criteria included more than 6 lesions per
hemothorax, diameter of metastases >5cm, lesions immediately adjacent to major pulmonary vessels, lesions immediately adjacent to major bronchi, significant

coagulopathies (INR >1.5; platelets <100  109), and
poor lung function. In patients with a history of lung diseases, lung function tests were performed to evaluate their
pulmonary reserve and appropriateness for RFA.
Preprocedural Evaluation
All patients in the study were evaluated clinically on the
basis of the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria for their suitability to undergo RFA. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
was performed on all patients. In some patients, a positron
emission tomography (PET) scan was performed to further characterize the malignancy risk of the lesion. Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were
measured. The results of the aforementioned investigations were used to assess response to treatment after RFA.
Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation
Protocol
All RFA procedures were performed under fluoro-CT
guidance by an interventional radiologist (D.G.). The CT
machine (Xpress SX; Toshiba, Japan) coupled with a Rita
1500 generator (Rita Medical, Mountain View, Calif)
enabled real-time imaging display, along with temperature, power, and impedance. The patients’ vital signs were
monitored continuously during the procedure. Patients
were positioned on the CT table according to the location
of their metastases. For metastases in the anterior chest
cavity, the position adopted was supine to facilitate an anterior approach. For metastases located in the posterior
chest, patients were positioned in the prone position for a
posterior approach.
Midazolam was administered intravenously to
achieve light sedation. Under local anesthetic (Xylocaine
1%), a Rita Starburst XL (Rita Medical Systems, Fremont, Calif) probe was inserted percutaneously into the
lung and advanced toward the lesion under CT guidance.
The length of the 14-gauge probe was of either 10 cm or
15 cm. Once the probe was correctly positioned in the
lesion, the tines were deployed. Lesions >3 cm in diameter required overlapping ablation fields. The initial power
setting was 35 W. The ablation algorithm was gradually
increased to 150 W with incremental probe deployment
to achieve the desired target temperature of 90 C. The
temperature was maintained at a fixed time depending on
lesion size according to a fixed protocol. Lesions of 3 cm,
4 cm, and 5 cm were maintained for 15, 20, and 37
minutes, respectively. Ablation of the insertion tract was

2107

performed upon withdrawal of the probe to prevent seeding of tumor cells.
Postprocedural Management
Patients were admitted in hospital for at least 1 day for observation. A chest x-ray was performed 1 hour after the
procedure and again just before discharge to exclude pneumothorax. Patients who had large or clinically significant
pneumothorax required chest drains. Small and asymptomatic pneumothorax were managed conservatively.
Systemic Chemotherapy
All patients in this study were treated with either 5-fluorouracil–based chemotherapy or capecitabine. This was
combined with modern-agent chemotherapy such as oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or without biologically targeted
therapies such as bevacizumab and cetuximab. Specific
data on the type and the mode of use of systemic chemotherapy before RFA (neoadjuvant) or after RFA (adjuvant) were obtained retrospectively through examination
of the patients’ medical charts. For the purpose of this
study, adjunct systemic chemotherapy was considered to
be neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy received with
RFA treatment. In this instance, the reason for referral
was often to use RFA as a complimentary local treatment
in addition to systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of
colorectal pulmonary metastases. Patients who did not
receive any periprocedural (neoadjuvant or adjuvant)
chemotherapy were regarded as not having had adjunct
systemic chemotherapy.
Follow-Up
All patients were followed every 3 months. Helical contrast-enhanced CT was performed every 6 months. The
primary study endpoint was from the time of treatment to
the time of cancer-related death (overall survival). Followup data were obtained from the referring physicians and
telephone calls and/or e-mails from the patients. Response
to RFA was evaluated at the sixth-month, post-treatment,
chest CT according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) where complete response
(CR) is reported when the target lesion demonstrates cavitations, necrosis and cyst formation with a 25% reduction
in size, partial response (PR) is reported when the target
lesion demonstrates necrosis with liquid density in the
central component or when there is >30% reduction in
the longest diameter, stable disease (SD) is reported when
the target lesion demonstrates <30% reduction in the
longest diameter or maintains a solid appearance without

2108

central necrosis or cavitations, and progressive disease
(PD) is reported when the target lesion increases by
>20% in size and maintains a solid mass with invasion of
adjacent structures.19
Statistical Analysis
The data collected were analyzed by using SPSS for Windows version 15.0 (SPSS, Munich, Germany). The
patient characteristics were reported by using frequency
and descriptive analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to analyze survival. Univariate analysis (log-rank)
was performed to determine the clinicopathological factors affecting survival. Multivariate analysis was performed on all factors P < .10 by using the Cox
proportional hazards regression model. The median time
to death was defined as the time when 50% of patients
have died. Follow-up was calculated from the date of RFA
treatment to the date of last follow-up. P  .05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
A total of 100 patients underwent RFA treatment for
colorectal pulmonary metastases. There were 39 (39%)
females and 61 (61%) males. The mean age was 65 years
(standard deviation [SD] ¼ 11 years). Sixty-eight patients
had colon cancer, and 32 patients had rectal cancer. At the
time of diagnosis of colorectal cancer, 7 patients had stage
I disease, 39 patients had stage II disease, 24 patients had

Complications of Radiofrequency Ablation of
Colorectal Pulmonary Metastases
There was no treatment-related mortality. Seventy-six
patients were treated with minor or no complications.
Minor complications included small pneumothoraxes
and pleural effusions that did not require drainage and
pneumonitis or consolidation that were treated medically.
Twenty-three patients required chest-tube placement for
pneumothoraxes or pleural effusions. One patient who
initially had no complication at discharge represented
with an empyema that required pleurectomy and decortication. Correlation analysis showed that patients with 3
lesions was associated with developing a complication that
required chest-tube placement (P < .001).
Pulmonary Recurrences
At the time of analysis, 27 patients had no evidence of any
sites of metastatic disease, 24 patients were alive with disease, and 49 patients had died of disease. Among the 24
patients alive with disease, 10 patients were alive with pulmonary metastases. Among the 49 patients who died of

Survival Outcomes
The median follow-up period was 23 months (range, 1 to
96) from the time of RFA treatment. Forty-nine (49%)
patients in the study cohort had died. The median overall
survival after RFA treatment was 36 months (95% CI,
30% to 43%). The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival
rates were 87%, 66%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. The
median overall survival from time of first diagnosis of
colorectal cancer was 79 months (95% CI, 65% to 94%)
with 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 65% and
17%, respectively (Fig. 1).

Variables where P<.10 in the univariate analysis
were subjected to a Cox proportional hazards regression
model for a multivariate analysis. Independent predictors
for survival included response to RFA treatment (hazard
ratio [HR] 3.8; 95% CI, 2.20 to 6.50; P < .001; Fig. 2),
repeat RFA treatment (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.60;
P ¼ .002; Fig. 3), presence of extrapulmonary metastases
at RFA (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.34 to 6.64; P ¼ .008;
Fig. 4), and adjunct systemic chemotherapy (HR, 0.3;
95% CI, 0.10 to 1.03; P ¼ .05; Fig. 5 and Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Previously, metastatic disease was viewed as a terminal entity from a progressive malignant disease. Today, increasing efforts are directed toward treatment of metastatic
diseases, such as in colorectal cancer, through the use of
multimodality therapy from systemic chemotherapy, biologically targeted therapies, surgical metastasectomy, and
ablative therapy. The reported institutional experience
presented is an example of a combination of systemic and
locally ablative therapy that uses radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) for the treatment of colorectal pulmonary metastases. At present, this is the largest presented series in the
literature.

Figure 3. Log-rank analysis demonstrates survival plots of
patients with colorectal pulmonary metastases who received
single RFA treatment and repeat RFA treatment.

All treated patients had unresectable pulmonary
metastases and were treated with curative intent. All
patients had previously undergone colorectal surgery for
their primary tumors and, where indicated, systemic
chemotherapy was administered. Fifty percent of
patients had previously undergone surgical resection of
liver metastases, and 8% had undergone pulmonary
metastasectomy. The treatment of pulmonary metastases
by using RFA became an option at a median of 28
months after initial diagnosis; hence, the currently
reported cohort comprised a group of patients who had
been heavily pretreated for primary and metastatic disease with both surgical and systemic treatments. Furthermore, 24% of patients underwent repeat RFA for
persistent or new lesions within the lungs. Treatment of
pulmonary metastases yielded an overall median survival
of 36 months with a 5-year overall survival rate of 30%.
The 5- and 10-year overall survival was 65% and 17%,
respectively, from the time of diagnosis for the group of
patients with colorectal cancer who subsequently developed metastatic disease.
Prognostic factors for survival identified through
this study included factors established within the metastasectomy literature of colorectal pulmonary metastases.
These include histopathological grade of the primary tumor,20,21 time to RFA treatment (pulmonary disease-free
interval),22-24 repeat RFA treatments,25 and the presence
of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.20,26,27 Specific to the

at the time of RFA treatment, complete or partial response
after RFA treatment, and the use of systemic chemotherapy as an adjunct to RFA treatment were predictive factors
for an improved survival rate. Multivariate analyses of factors validated within the Cox regression model showed
that patient response after RFA treatment, repeating RFA
treatment, the presence of extrapulmonary metastases at
RFA, and the use of adjunctive systemic chemotherapy
were independent predictors for survival.
Although evaluating pulmonary recurrence-free survival time would elucidate the true value of this local ablative therapy, specifically on colorectal pulmonary
metastases, patients with metastatic disease often have

2112

recurrences at multiple sites. Among the 73 patients that
have developed recurrent disease or have died, 49 (67%)
patients had pulmonary metastases apart from other
common sites of metastases such as the liver, abdomen,
brain, and bone. The efficacy of RFA on colorectal pulmonary metastases would be determined together with
systemic therapies that would target other occult microscopic metastases present in patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer. In a prospective multicenter study of
the impact of circulating tumor cells on clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,
Cohen et al28 reported that the quantity of circulating
tumor cells was associated with progression-free survival

and overall survival. Hence, survival in patients with
metastatic disease is likely determined by the effective
treatment of bulky tumor masses with local therapy such
as resection or ablation. To complement local treatment,
occult metastasis, which are more often than not a common contributor toward treatment failure, will need to
be addressed through systemic therapies. The survival
benefits accrued to patients who received adjunctive systemic chemotherapy in addition to RFA in this study
support this treatment rationale.
In a multicenter study in Japan of 71 patients with
identified extrapulmonary metastases, Yamakado et al29
reported that tumor size and carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) levels were important prognostic factors for survival. The 3-year survival rate of 46% in this Japanese
multicenter study appears to be similar to the 3-year survival rate of 50% reported in the current study despite us
treating a high proportion of patients who had advanced
colorectal cancer (54% with initial stage III and IV).
This treatment is considered safe with a low risk of severe
complications. Clearly, the combined observations from
both the Yamakado study and ours provide a strong basis
for the feasibility and clinical efficacy of this treatment in
patients who are not surgical candidates. The 5-year survival outcome of 30% in the current study iterates the
safety and efficacy of this treatment that compares favorably with the 5-year survival of 48% that was reported in
a systematic review of published results on surgical resection for colorectal pulmonary metastases that comprised
of 1684 patients from 17 different studies where the
mortality rate ranged from 0 to 2.5%.15
In conclusion, the use of RFA to treat colorectal pulmonary metastases is a step toward a nonsurgical option
that combines systemic and local treatment for metastatic
disease. Our institution’s experience in the use of this ablative technique for pulmonary metastases has led to a
decline in the incidence of postprocedural complications
and an improved patient selection process through identification of appropriate lesion characteristics for this treatment.30 Although pulmonary metastasectomy has proven
survival benefits, the ongoing debate over the practice of
pulmonary metastasectomy leads us to conclude that a
prospective randomized trial to compare metastasectomy
and RFA may be a valid trial. The optimal manner in
which systemic therapy is given remains an unanswered
question. Nonetheless, the combination of chemotherapy
and RFA treatment offers the potential for disease control
and improved survival in patients with colorectal pulmonary metastases.
