ABSTRACT
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for cervical cancer, and its role in
head and neck carcinoma has been reported. No drug is approved for the treatment of
HPV-related diseases but cidofovir (CDV) exhibits selective antiproliferative activity.
In this study, we analyzed the effects of CDV-resistance (CDVR) in two HPV(+)
(SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV) and one HPV(−) (HaCaTCDV) tumor cell lines. Quantification of CDV
metabolites and analysis of the sensitivity profile to chemotherapeutics was performed.
Transporters expression related to multidrug-resistance (MRP2, P-gp, BCRP)
was also investigated.
Alterations of CDV metabolism in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV, but not in HaCaTCDV,
emerged via impairment of UMP/CMPK1 activity. Mutations (P64T and R134M) as
well as down-regulation of UMP/CMPK1 expression were observed in SiHaCDV and
HeLaCDV, respectively. Altered transporters expression in SiHaCDV and/or HeLaCDV, but
not in HaCaTCDV, was also noted.
Taken together, these results indicate that CDVR in HPV(+) tumor cells is a
multifactorial process.

INTRODUCTION

polymerases and incorporation into genomic DNA
causing DNA breaks and/or apoptosis induction [11].
The higher sensitivity of cervical carcinoma cells
carrying the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome,
i.e. SiHa [HPV16 (+)] and HeLa [HPV18 (+)] to CDV
compared to primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) has
been explained by the differential response of tumor
cells and normal cells to DNA damage [12, 13].
The cytosolic UMP/CMP kinase 1, a key enzyme
in the activation of antiviral and anticancer drugs,
catalyzes the phosphorylation of (d)CMP analogues to
their diphosphate forms [14–16]. 2′-deoxycytidine (dC)
(i.e. lamivudine and emtricitabine) or 2′-deoxycytidine
monophosphate (dCMP) (i.e. CDV) analogues require
phosphorylation by UMP/CMPK1 [17]. The first and

Cidofovir (CDV) is an acyclic nucleoside
phosphonate (ANP) with broad spectrum anti-DNA
virus activity [1]. Its intravenous form is approved
for therapy of cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS
patients [2]. CDV is also used off-label for treatment
of several diseases associated with herpesviruses
other than cytomegalovirus, comprising adeno-, pox-,
polyoma-, and papillomaviruses [3–6]. Besides its
well-characterized antiviral activity, CDV is active as
an antitumor agent in several animal models, including
human cervical carcinoma xenografts in athymic nude
mice [7–10]. CDV inhibitory effect on tumor growth
has been attributed to its recognition by cellular DNA

RESULTS

last phosphorylation steps of cytidine 2′-deoxynucleoside
analogues are catalyzed, respectively, by deoxycytidine
kinase (dCK) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK)
[17]. Similarly, the anticancer agents cytarabine (araC)
and gemcitabine (dFdC) are activated by UMP/CMPK1
following prior conversion to their 5′-monophosphate
forms by dCK [18]. The mitochondrial form of UMP/
CMPK (i.e. UMP/CMPK2) possesses distinct substrate
specificity since it recognizes dUMP and dCMP as best
phosphate acceptors while the cytosolic form preferentially
phosphorylates CMP and UMP [19]. Both enzymes are
also able to phosphorylate nucleotide analogues such as the
monophosphate forms of the anti-cancer agents araC-MP
and dFdC-MP [15, 18–20].
Failure to anticancer therapy is often due to
drug-resistance because of emergence of mutations in
the cellular target or in one of the activating enzymes,
multidrug-resistance (MDR) events leading to efflux of the
active metabolite, or activation of DNA repair pathways
[21–23]. Several drug-resistance mechanisms for araC
or dFdC were described, including i) deamination by
cytidine deaminase which converts araC into the inactive
metabolite araU [24, 25], ii) down-regulation of the
equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1), the major
carrier for araC and dFdC uptake [26], iii) circumvention
of dCK-dependent araC and dFdC phosphorylation by
down-regulation of dCK expression or point mutations
leading to weaker activation of araC and dFdC [27, 28].
Unlike araC and dFdC, CDV intracellular uptake
occurs via fluid-phase endocytosis and is independent
of hENT [29]. In primary kidney tubular cells, CDV
uptake is mediated through the organic anion transporters
OAT1, and to a lesser extent OAT3. CDV activation is
independent from dCK since CDV bears a phosphonate
moiety at its methoxyhydroxypropyl part, bypassing then
the initial phosphorylation by a nucleoside kinase. Thus,
CDV-resistance (CDVR) mechanisms are expected to be
different from those described for cytosine nucleoside
analogues.
In this study, we investigated the impact of CDVR
on UMP/CMPK1 and on nucleoside metabolism, in
particular on CTP and UTP biosynthesis. Three cell lines
[two HPV(+) (SiHa and HeLa) and one HPV(–)
(HaCaT)] were selected in vitro for resistance to CDV
and were denoted SiHaCDV, HeLaCDV and HaCaTCDV.
The susceptibility of these cell lines to several
chemotherapeutics was assessed, as well as, the emergence
of multi-drug-resistance mechanisms through upregulation
of specific transporters. The metabolism of CDV, and in
particular its incorporation into genomic DNA, was also
investigated in these CDVR cell lines.

Growth rate of CDVR cells and sensitivity to
ANPs
SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV had a significantly slower
growth rate than parental cells [doubling time (DT)
of 36 h versus 22 h and 24 h versus 21 h, respectively]
(Figure S1). In contrast, cellular growth rates were not
significantly different between HaCaTparental and HaCaTCDV
cells (i.e. DT of 26 h and 23 h, respectively).
To determine the sensitivity of parental and CDVR
cells to CDV, CC50’s following 7 days of incubation in
the presence of the drug were evaluated (Figure 1). The
highest fold-resistance (FR) was found for SiHaCDV (> 133)
while for HeLaCDV and HaCaTCDV, FR values were of > 18
and > 49, respectively.
The sensitivity of CDVR cells to several
chemotherapeutics was also investigated (Figure 1).
Five different levels of resistance/hypersensitivity were
recognized when considering a statistical significant
difference (p < 0.05) between compounds’ CC50 values
for parental and CDVR cells together with FR values: high
resistance (FR ≥ 10), moderate resistance (5 ≤ FR < 10),
mild resistance (2.0 ≤ FR < 5), no resistance (0.4 < FR < 2.0)
and hypersensitivity (0.4 ≥ FR).
Regarding ANPs, SiHaCDV cells were found to be
highly resistant to HPMP derivatives with a FR in the range
of 10 to 133 and moderate resistant to PME derivatives
(Figure 1). For HeLaCDV cells, high resistance was observed
for cHPMPC, moderate resistance to HPMPO-DAPY,
HPMP-5azaC, cHPMP-azaC and HPMPA, while
mild resistance was found for 3-deaza-HPMPA,
PMEA, PMEG and cPr-PMEDAP. HaCaTCDV was highly
resistant to cHPMPC, HPMPA, cHPMPA, HPMP-5azaC,
moderately resistant to cHPMP-5azaC and exhibited
mild resistance to HPMPDAP and HPMPO-DAPY.
Hypersensitivity to PMEDAP and PMEA was observed
for HaCaTCDV .

Sensitivity of CDVR cells to distinct
chemotherapeutic agents
The results for other chemotherapeutics, structurally
unrelated to ANPs but possessing antiproliferative activity
against several type of cancers, are shown in Figure 1.
Moderate resistance was observed against fludarabine and
mild resistance against cytarabine, camptothecin, SN-38
and topotecan, while hypersensitivity was demonstrated to
docetaxel when tested on the SiHaCDV. HeLaCDV was found
to have high resistance to fludarabine and mild resistance
to cytarabine, while hypersensitivity was found for
daunorubicin. HaCaTCDV was shown to be hypersensitive
to docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil and cytarabine.

Microarray data highlighted some genes likely
involved in hypersensitivity or resistance to different
chemotherapeutics in CDVR cells. For some of the
differentially expressed genes, in particular those coding
for proteins involved in uptake/efflux of different
chemotherapeutics, enzymes required for their activation
or catabolism and their target proteins, protein level
variations were indicated (Table 1).

In SiHaCDV, cross-resistance to camptothecin, SN-38
and topotecan can be explained via up-regulation of
efflux pump genes ABCG2 (BCRP) and/or ABCC2
(MRP2) (Table 1), as demonstrated in previous studies
with different malignant cells [30–32]. Down-regulation
of influx transporters SLC22A6 (OAT1) and SLC29A1
(ENT1), and decreased expression of phosphorylating
enzymes (AK2 and CMPK1), may be responsible for

cross-resistance to fludarabine and cytarabine,
respectively.
In HeLaCDV, up-regulation of the DNA polymerase ɛ
sub-unit 4 (POLE4) (a subunit responsible for activation
of replication and repair) might explain cross-resistance
to fludarabine (Table 1) because of increased excision of
fludarabine incorporated into DNA [33]. Hypersensitivity
to docetaxel, 5-FU and cytarabine in HaCaTCDV could
be mediated through up-regulation of influx transporters
(SLC29A2; ENT2) or proteins involved in drug catabolism
such as CYP1B1 and CYP3A7.

P-gp/MDR1 (ABCB1), BCRP (ABCG2) and OAT1
(SLC22A6)] was measured by Western blot. OAT1 was
downregulated in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV (2-fold) but not in
HaCaTCDV (Figure 2A–2D). BCRP levels were increased in
SiHaCDV but not in HeLaCDV and HaCaTCDV (Figure 2A–2D).
MRP2 was only upregulated in SiHaCDV (Figure 2B–2D)
while P-gp was not affected in any of the three CDVR cell
lines (Figure 2C–2D).
The sensitivity of parental and CDVR cells to
different MDR or P-gp inhibitors was then assessed
(Figure S2). Zosuquidar and Tariquidar (P-gp inhibitors)
as well as Reversan and MK-571 (MRP inhibitors) act as
competitive inhibitors while verapamil and indomethacin
are non-competitive inhibitors of MRP1. SiHaCDV showed
hypersensitivity to reversan but not to MK-571. HeLaCDV
displayed hypersensitivity to reversan and verapamil
while HaCaTCDV showed hypersensitivity to tariquidar and
indomethacin.

We next evaluated CDV and HPMPA
antiproliferative activities in presence of MDR or P-gp
inhibitors to rule out differences in transport of purine
and pyrimidine analogues (Figure S3). SiHaparental was less
sensitive to CDV and HPMPA in presence of the MRP
inhibitor MK-571. In HeLaCDV, the HPMPA CC50 value
was lower in presence of 4 µg/ml of zosuquidar than
without inhibitor. The other inhibitors did not revert the
resistant phenotype. These data point to some alterations
of MDR and/or P-gp transporters in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV
cells but not in HaCaTCDV.

In contrast, in HaCaTCDV cells, no significant differences
with parental cells were measured for CDV metabolites
while, for CDV incorporation into DNA, a decrease of 30%
was observed (Figure 3C and 3D). Hence, each CDVR
cell type exhibited a different pattern of CDV activation
compared to parental counterpart.

Levels of UMP/CMPK1 affect CTP and UTP
synthesis
After analyzing protein expression of several
influx/efflux pumps in CDVR lines, we next measured
the expression of UMP/CMPK1, the enzyme responsible
for the first phosphorylation of CDV, in order to detect
any possible impairment in the activation pathway of the
drug. Parental SiHa and HeLa cells expressed 6-fold more
UMP/CMPK1 protein levels than the corresponding CDVR
cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 4A). In contrast, the difference
in UMP/CMPK1 expression between HaCaTparental and
HaCaTCDV was only of 1.4-fold (p = 0.3679) (Figure 4B).
For mitochondrial UMP/CMPK2, the fold-change between
parental and CDVR cells was not statistically significant
for any of the three cell lines.
The effects of changes on UMP/CMPK1 expression
on CTP and UTP synthesis were investigated. CDP levels
were significantly higher in parental cells than in CDVR
SiHa and HeLa cells (3.4 to 3.7 fold-change) while in
HaCaT cells, this difference was only of 1.7 (Figure 4C).

Intracellular CDV metabolism
The impact of drug-resistance acquisition on
CDV metabolism was analyzed to detect alterations in
CDV activation by cellular kinases. In SiHaCDV cells,
reduced amounts of CDV, CDV monophosphate (CDVp),
CDV diphosphate (CDVpp) (the active drug form) and
CDVp-choline were measured compared to SiHaparental
cells, but only the decrease in CDVp was statistically
significant (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the incorporation
of CDV into cellular DNA, measured after a drugexposure of 24 h, was reduced by 50% in SiHaCDV cells
(p = 0.0002) (Figure 3D). A more pronounced decrease in
CDV activation was observed in HeLaCDV cells (p < 0.05 for
all four metabolites) (Figure 3B) and CDV incorporation
into DNA was also reduced by 50% (p = 0.0006).

the levels of OAT1 and BCRP (A), MRP2 (B), and P-gp (C). Quantification of each band was done and standardized using actin as
housekeeping gene (D).

These results are in line with the lower levels of UMP/
CMPK1 in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV cells but not in HaCaTCDV
cells (Figure 4A–4B). In parallel, the levels of ATP and
GTP were also measured in parental and CDVR cell lines
(Figure S4). ATP levels were not significantly affected,
in the tested conditions, in the different cell lines (Figure
S4A) while, regarding GTP levels, a significant increased
level was only measured in HaCaTCDV cells compared to
the parental counterparts (Figure S4B).
Since UMP/CMPK1 activity is impaired in SiHa and
Hela CDVR cells, uridine (Urd) and cytidine (Cyd) were
added to the growth medium to restore CTP and UTP levels
(Figure 4C). By supplementing the cells with 100 µM
of Urd and Cyd, the difference in CDP levels between
parental and CDVR cells was abolished. Interestingly,
the 4-fold lower CTP levels in HeLaCDV cells than in
parental cells was reverted by the addition of Urd/Cyd. In
HeLaCDV cells, accumulation of CMP in the presence of

Urd/Cyd was found while there was barely any difference
in CMP level for HeLaparental cells with or without
Urd/Cyd-supplements. Higher CTP levels in Urd/Cyd
supplemented HaCaTCDV cells were observed than in the
parental cells.
When radiolabeled Cyd and Urd were added to the
cells and the levels of newly synthesized CTP and UTP
were measured, CTP production was found to be higher in
SiHaparental than in SiHaCDV (5-fold and 6-fold difference at
6 h and 24 h post-treatment, respectively). For HaCaT and
HeLa cells, the fold-changes in CTP production at 24 h
were 1.9 and 0.9, respectively (Figure 4D). These data
confirm a more pronounced difference in CTP production
between SiHaCDV and SiHaparental cells than in the two other
cell types. The UTP level variation seemed similar in the
three cell types when measured at 24 h post-treatment
(Figure 4D).

radiolabeled CDV. The mean values were calculated from at least three independent experiments. (D) The figure shows the incorporation of
CDV into DNA for the three different cell types. The mean values have been calculated from two independent experiments.

Molecular basis for resistance to CDV:
identification of mutations in UMP/CMPK1

We also genotyped the two HPV oncogenes, i.e. E6 and E7,
in SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV cells, but no differences were
observed between parental and CDVR.

Two amino acid changes in the UMP/CMPK1
of SiHaCDV cells were identified (Figure S5): P64T
[in the mobile nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) binding
domain] and R134M [in the LID domain] (Figure S6).
A mixed population of wild-type or double-mutated UMP/
CMPK1, or two single mutated UMP/CMPK1 were found.
Unlike SiHaCDV cells, no mutations in UMP/CMPK1 were
detected in HeLaCDV and HaCaTCDV cells. No mutations in
the UMP/CMPK2 gene were observed in the CDVR cells.

Enzymatic activity of recombinant UMP/CMPK1
To investigate the impact of the mutations
identified in the UMP/CMPK1 of SiHaCDV cells,
site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a plasmid
containing the coding sequence for UMP/CMPK1 to
produce mutant enzymes carrying the P64T, R134M or
a combination of both amino acid changes. The enzyme

bearing the P64T substitution had impaired enzymatic
activity compared to the wild-type protein. Using CMP
and UMP as phosphate acceptor, the turn-over number
kcat was, respectively, 0.31 s−1 and 0.35 s-1 for the P64T
mutant compared to, respectively, 125 s−1 and 188 s−1 for
the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). The affinity (KM) for these
substrates was also affected (KM values of 123 µM and
250 µM for, respectively, CMP and UMP with the P64T
UMP/CMPK1 mutant, instead of 20 µM and 100 µM
with the wild-type enzyme). As a result, the catalytic
efficiency (kcat/KM) for phosphorylation decreased in the
range of 1,340- to 2,480-fold for the mutant P64T UMP/
CMPK1. The phosphorylation of dCMP and dUMP was
also dramatically affected by the P64T substitution. dCMP
was poorly phosphorylated by the P64T mutant, and
dUMP was not metabolized at all under the experimental
conditions used. The mutant P64T UMP/CMPK1 did not
metabolize CDV and its 5-aza derivative (5azaCDV).
The phosphorylation of these drugs by the wild-type
enzyme was significantly slower than the rate seen for
dCMP (kcat of 0.09 s-1 and 0.47 s−1, for CDV and 5azaCDV,
respectively versus 13.4 s−1). On the contrary, cytarabine
monophosphate (araCMP) was phosphorylated by the
mutant enzyme but with a dramatic decrease of the
catalytic rate (kcat = 0.019 s−1 and KM = 327 µM, instead of
kcat = 130 s−1 and KM = 315 for wild-type enzyme).
The enzymes bearing the R134M amino acid
change alone or in combination with the P64T, did not
exhibit enzymatic activity with the natural substrates
nor with CDV. The catalytic efficiencies obtained for the
UMP/CMPK1, could be ranked from the best acceptor
substrate to the weakest, as follows: CMP > UMP >
araCMP > dCMP > dUMP > 5azaCDV > CDV for the
wild-type enzyme, and CMP > UMP > araCMP ≥ dCMP
for the mutant P64T enzyme. For the wild-type enzyme,
the kinetic parameters obtained for the natural substrates
were similar to those obtained in a previous study [15].

UMP/CMPK1 protein induced by the P64T amino acid
change (θ, being the degree of ellipticity).
The stability of the wild-type and the three mutant
UMP/CMPK1 proteins was also investigated by thermal
denaturation at two different temperatures (i.e. 5°C and
70°C). Figure S7B shows the De at these temperatures for
the wild-type and the three UMP/CMPK1 mutants. The
P64T mutant started at a less native state compared to the
wild-type protein, but at 70°C, the enzyme was not totally
unfolded. The R134M mutant was very sensitive to thermal
denaturation and at high temperature, the denaturation
state was comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. The
double mutant P64T + R134M was at an intermediate state
between P64T and R134M (Figure S7B).
The R134M and P64T + R134M UMP/CMPK1
mutants are more sensitive to heat denaturation,
suggesting that the P64T substitution triggers important
conformational changes, higher stability of the enzyme
and markedly impaired activity regarding the natural
substrates CMP, UMP, dCMP and dUMP. The mutation
R134M totally inactivated the enzyme and, in addition,
destabilized the secondary structure, leading to a
temperature-sensitive protein.

Modeling studies of the P64T and R134M amino
acid changes
Models of the human UMP/CMPK1 were built
using as template the three-dimensional structure of the
Dictyostelium discoideum UMP/CMPK in the closed
conformation complexed with ADP and CMP (pdb code:
2UKD). The cytosine base interacts via water-mediated
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with
residues Ile-62, Val-63 and Asn-97 (Figure 5A). Pro-64
is located next to Ile-62 and Val-63 and allows the
positioning of these residues close to the cytosine moiety
for the establishment of efficient interactions. The P64T
substitution may modify the distance between Ile-62,
Val-63 and CMP, and therefore reduce the intensity
or abolish the interactions observed in the wild-type
UMP/CMPK1 at this position (Figure 5B). The Arg-134 is
located in the LID domain, a mobile domain that contains
positively charged residues able to stabilize the phosphate
of the ATP with the magnesium ion in the active site
(Figure 5C). The amino acid change Arg-to-Met at position
134 might dramatically decrease the number of polar
interactions between the ATP and CMP molecules and
the magnesium ion (Figure 5D). The typical interactions
established between an arginine to bridge the phosphate of
ATP and CMP for the enzymatic reaction are abolished in
the presence of Met-134. As observed with the enzymatic
studies, this mutation results in inactivation of the enzyme.

human UMP/CMPK1 and the closed conformation of the
Dictyostelium discoideum UMP/CMPK bound to CMP

Impact of point mutations on UMP/CMPK1
conformation and stability
The effect of the two mutations on the stability of the
UMP/CMPK1 protein was assessed by circular dichroism
(CD). Far-UV CD spectra of wild-type UMP/CMPK1
without ligand showed the characteristic shape of a
α-helix-rich protein with minima at 208 nm and 222 nm
and a maximum at 192 nm. The CD spectrum of mutant
P64T UMP/CMPK1 showed significant changes in the
minima 208 nm and 222 nm but the overall shape is
indicating a strong a-helix content (Figure S7A). The
effect of the amino acid change P64T is directly reflected
on this α-helix environment since the minima at 208 nm

clearly shows that the helix a4 undergoes an important
movement while closing the active site (Figure 5E).
The residue at position 64 is located at the hinge, triggering
this important conformational change and, consequently,
an amino acid change at this specific position might have
an important effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
This hypothesis is consistent with the kinetic parameters
obtained with the mutant P64T UMP/CMPK1 that
exhibited slower rates of phosphorylation for the natural
substrates CMP, UMP and dCMP.

decrease in CDVp but not in CDVpp or CDVp-choline.
The enzymatic UMP/CMPK1 assay demonstrated that
both amino acid changes (i.e. P64T and R134M) abolished
the capacity of the enzyme to efficiently phosphorylate
CDV. However, we did detect intracellular CDVp and
the subsequent metabolites CDVpp and CDVp-choline
in SiHaCDV, suggesting that both wild-type and double
mutant UMP/CMPK1s are expressed in these cells. The
electropherograms of UMP/CMPK1 cDNA sequencing
performed for SiHaCDV cells at passages 55 and 230
showed a mixed population of wild-type and mutant
cells (1:1 ratio) at both positions (Figure S5). Thus,
it can be inferred that both mutations are present in
one allele and the other allele encodes for a wild-type
enzyme. Co-existence of a mixed population of cells,
one expressing exclusively wild-type enzyme and the
other one expressing only mutant UMP/CMPK1, appears
to be highly improbable since SiHaparental cells have a
faster growth rate and, hence, would overgrow SiHaCDV
cells after several passages. Furthermore, the enzymatic
study performed with mutant proteins showed that both
P64T and R134M single mutations lead to impaired or
non-functional enzymes while SiHaCDV cells were able to
generate CTP from exogenous Cyd, UTP from added Urd,
as well as CDVp and subsequent metabolites from CDV.
Quantification of UMP/CMPK1 in SiHaCDV cells showed
a dramatic decrease in the protein pool in comparison
with parental cells. Protein stability assays showed that
the P64T + R134M UMP/CMPK1 mutant is highly
sensitive to temperature denaturation, and hence is an
instable protein. Since the mutant enzyme is less stable,
its intracellular half-life might be altered leading to faster
degradation via the proteasome pathway. In conclusion,
these data indicate that SiHaCDV cells most likely express
both wild-type and mutant UMP/CMPK1.
The impact of altered UMP/CMPK1 expression on
the activation of (d)C analogues might differ from cell to
cell since it has been reported that modulation of UMP/
CMPK1 expression did not influence the activation of
C and U analogues (dFdC, L-OddC and 5-FU) in RKO

DISCUSSION
Emergence of drug-resistance after long-term
exposure to antiproliferative agents is frequently observed
in anticancer therapy. In general, drug-resistance can
be related to several mechanisms including decreased
uptake of the drug, slower drug-activation and faster
drug-excretion via efflux pump(s). Studies of cytarabine
and gemcitabine resistance mechanism have played
an important role in the characterization of pyrimidine
metabolism in tumor cells, but up to now, no description
of resistance has been done regarding UMP/CMPK1. This
is the first report of mutations in the UMP/CMPK1 linked
to drug-resistance.
In SiHaCDV cells, two mutations were identified in
the CMPK1 gene leading to low levels of UMP/CMPK1
protein. On the other hand, the reduced UMP/CMPK1
protein level in HeLaCDV was linked to down-regulation
of CMPK1 gene expression. In HaCaTCDV, no changes in
UMP/CMPK1 protein content were detected. These results
are in line with impairment of CDV metabolism in SiHaCDV
and HeLaCDV but not in HaCaTCDV. These data highlight a
different pattern of CDV metabolism in each CDVR cell
lines and that reduction of UMP/CMPK1 protein level
is not enough to explain CDVR, since HaCaTCDV cells
exhibited CDVR despite no impairment of UMP/CMPK1.
Reduced levels of UMP/CMPK1 in SiHaCDV
resulted in poor CDV activation as shown by a significant

cells but well that of 2FdC, araC and 5-FU in HeLa S3
and HCT8 cells [34,35]. In our study, we observed that
genes related to metabolism of nucleoside analogues, such
as CMPK1 and SLC29A1, were differentially expressed
in SiHaCDV compared to SiHaparental cells. However, these
alterations were not linked to a drug-resistance phenotype
such as gemcitabine-resistance. We cannot exclude that
impairment of gemcitabine uptake and activation could be
compensated by other transporters and enzymes (e.g. SLC
29A2 and CMPK2). Furthermore, no data for the cell lines
here studied have been published yet describing the uptake
and activation of cytarabine, gemcitabine and CDV.
In HeLaCDV cells, the total CDV metabolism seemed
to be affected since not only the amount of CDVp was
reduced but also CDV, CDVpp and CDVp-choline
pools. The impairment in the whole metabolism of CDV
might imply a role for the uptake or efflux considering
the reduced amounts of intracellular CDV and CDVpp,
resulting in a decreased CDV incorporation into the
genomic DNA.
In HaCaTCDV, no significant differences were
observed regarding CDV metabolism and a small
decrease in CDV incorporation into DNA was noted
although a 58-fold resistance to CDV was found. Thus,
other events may be responsible for CDVR in these cells,
such as alterations in CDV-targeted cellular pathways.
The microarray analysis performed on parental and CDVR
HaCaT cells showed that DNA repair mechanism(s) might
also be responsible for CDVR. The activation of these
pathways might explain the resistance to CDV even if no
significant impairment of the metabolism of this drug was
registered. Furthermore, other cellular pathways (such
as ‘Wnt/β-catenin signaling’, ‘ERK/MAPK signaling’,
‘EGF signaling’, ‘NFkB signaling’ or ‘acute phase
response signaling’) might have an effect on CDVR since
several genes are differentially expressed in the HaCaTCDV
compared to HaCaTparental.
The kinetic parameters obtained with the recombinant
P64T UMP/CMPK1 enzyme with natural substrates
indicated that the apparent affinity KM was not dramatically
affected. The main reason for the impaired phosphorylation
of natural substrates for this mutant enzyme was the rate
of catalysis since the kcat values were 403-, 537- and
372-fold slower for CMP, UMP and dCMP, respectively,
than for the wild-type enzyme. The mobility of the NMP
domain, induced by substrate binding to the active site,
appears to play an important role in the catalysis reaction
[36]. Substrate binding leads to displacement of 18 Å
of E59 carbon α, a residue belonging to the NMP binding
domain [37]. The P64 residue, located in the hinge, allows
the NMP binding site main helices (α3–α4) to change
conformation in order to stabilize the closed conformation
of the enzyme. The amino acid change P64T may alter this
mobility, affecting the rate of phosphorylation by UMP/
CMPK1 of any phosphate acceptor.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Circular dichroism assays performed in thermal
denaturing conditions demonstrated that the mutant P64T
protein has a higher stability than the wild-type enzyme.
By decreasing the mobility of the NMP domain, the P64T
substitution may lead to a more compact protein. Even
though the mutant enzyme acquires a higher stability,
its enzymatic activity is dramatically impaired and CDV
phosphorylation totally abolished.
The second affected position, R134, is located
in the LID domain and is crucial for the activity of the
UMP/CMPK1 enzyme since it interacts with ATP.
The arginine to methionine change at the homologous
position R132 in the human AMP kinase (that is
structurally related to UMP/CMPK1) reduces the
phosphorylation rate of AMP from 650 s-1 to 0.08 s-1 [38].
This conserved residue has an important role in the
enzymatic activity of nucleoside monophosphate kinases,
since it stabilizes the transition state for phosphate transfer
between the two substrates. Circular dichroism analysis
of the mutants bearing the R134M amino acid change
revealed that the mutant protein has higher instability than
the wild-type one, consistent with reduced protein levels.
Several multidrug-resistance proteins have been
shown to be upregulated in CDVR cells. Regarding ANPs,
MRP4, -5, -7 and -8 were shown to confer resistance to
adefovir (PMEA); MRP4 is associated with resistance to
PMEG, cPr-PMEDAP and PMEDAP; and overexpression
of MRP5 confers resistance to PMEDAP [39–43]. Today,
none of these transporters has been studied in the context
of CDVR, and we cannot exclude that upregulation of
one of the MRPs might, in part, be responsible for CDVR
in SiHaCDV, HeLaCDV and HaCaTCDV cells. For instance,
MRP2 is upregulated in SiHaCDV, and CDV was shown
to be both a substrate and an inhibitor of this transporter
in primary tubular renal cells [44]. BCRP (ABCG2)
was found upregulated in SiHaCDV while P-gp might be
associated with HPMPAR in HeLaCDV, since zosuquidar,
a known inhibitor of P-gp, decreased CC50 value for
HPMPA (Figure S8), even if no upregulation of P-gp was
seen in HeLaCDV. These results suggest that altered levels
of BCRP, MRP2 and P-gp transporters might contribute to
CDVR in SiHaCDV and/or HeLaCDV.
On the other hand, CDV uptake has been described
to be mediated by SLC22A6-encoded OAT1 and higher
protein levels of OAT1 were found in SiHaparental and
HeLaparental which may reduce CDV uptake. However,
since fluid-phase endocytosis has been described as the
major mechanism of CDV uptake, and the expression of
SLC22A6 genes is predominantly observed in renal cells,
the impact of altered OAT1 expression on intracellular
CDV pools might be very limited [45].
The impaired activity of the UMP/CMPK1 enzyme
in the SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV cells could explain, at least in
part, their reduced growth rate. Since the R134M change
destabilizes the structure of UMP/CMPK1 leading to a

10396

reduced amount of protein, the decrease in intracellular
UTP and CTP pools in resistant cells may be responsible,
at least in part, for their slower growth rate. Similarly,
doubling times of HeLaparental and HeLaCDV cells were
significant different suggesting an important role for UMP/
CMPK1 in cellular growth. In HaCaTCDV, no significant
decrease in UMP/CMPK1 protein level and no significant
difference in growth rate were noted, even if CDVR HaCaT
cells appear to grow slightly faster than the parental
counterpart. This might be the result of an increased GTP
level in HaCaTCDV compared to HaCaTparental cells.

the nephrotoxicity being the most encountered
side-effect. Recent publications revealed some promising
compounds such as the HIV-protease inhibitors lopinavir
and nelfinavir, but further characterizations of their antiHPV activity are needed [46]. Also, inhibition of cellular
pathways frequently altered in HPV-induced neoplasia,
such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling represent
a suitable target for therapeutic intervention [47].
In conclusion, acquisition of resistance to CDV
in tumor cell appears to be a multifactorial process and
different mechanisms are involved in distinct cell lines.
Importantly, we showed that alterations in UMP/CMPK1
may contribute to CDV-resistance in some cell lines.

CDVR seems to be acquired through alterations
of CDV metabolism (i.e. impairment of UMP/CMPK1
activity) as well as MDR events (i.e. changes in expression
of BCRP, MRP2 and OAT1) in SiHa and HeLa cells,
indicating a multifactorial biochemical basis (Figure S8).
On the other hand, in HaCaT cells, these factors were not
found to be dramatically changed, suggesting that CDVR
is mediated through an alternate mechanism that might
involve genes linked to DNA damage response. In these
cells, the levels of intracellular CDV metabolites were
unaltered, further excluding the enzymes involved in CDV
activation as responsible for the resistance phenotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
The list of the ANPs and chemotherapeutics used in
this study is provided in Tables S1 and Figure S9. The source
of other chemical reagents was as follows: Uridine (Urd)
and adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) Calbiochem; cytidine
(Cyd), Valeant Pharmaceuticals; cytidine-5′-monophosphate
(CMP), uridine-5′-monophosphate (UMP), 2′-deoxycytidine5′-monophosphate (dCMP) and 2′-deoxyuridine-5′monophosphate (dUMP), Sigma-Aldrich; arabinocytidine5′-monophosphate (araCMP), [5-3H]-radiolabeled CDV
and [5-3H]-uridine, Moravek Biochemicals; and [5-3H]radiolabeled cytidine, MP Biochemicals.

One may wonder whether the presence of a partial
HPV genome and the constitutive expression of E6 and E7
oncoproteins might influence drug-resistance acquisition,
since both SiHaCDV and HeLaCDV, in contrast to HaCaTCDV
cells, underwent impairment of CDV activation and
incorporation as well as alterations in the expression of
drug transporters. Mutations in UMP/CMPK1 responsible
for CDV-resistance have been selected and characterized
in HPV(+) tumor cells and, to our knowledge, it is the
first time that this enzyme has been involved in resistance
against an antiviral or an anticancer drug, in vitro or
in vivo. Up to now, no CDVR has been observed in
patients receiving CDV for HPV-associated diseases.
Since UMP/CMPK1 is a key enzyme in the nucleoside
salvage pathway, its activity cannot be substituted by
another enzyme and therefore, the mutation-rate under
drug-pressure might be very low. Hence, the high genetic
barrier to CDVR may be considered as an asset for the
use of this drug in cancer therapy. On the other hand, a
low number of patients suffering from HPV-associated
diseases (genital warts or laryngeal papillomatosis) shows
an uncomplete response to CDV therapy. Genotyping
of CMPK1 gene should be considered when CDV
fails to clear HPV(+) cells in order to identify natural
polymorphisms able to confer resistance to CDV.

Selection of CDVR cells and growth rate
SiHa [HPV16(+)] and HeLa [HPV18(+)] cells were
obtained from ATCC (#HTB-35 and #CCL-2, respectively)
(Manassas, USA). HaCaT [HPV(–)] cells were kindly
provided by F. De Marco (Regina Elena Institute for Cancer
Research, Rome, Italy). Cell cultures were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum. Selection of HeLaCDV and HaCaTCDV
cells was performed as previously described for SiHaCDV
cells [48]. The growth rate of CDVR cells compared to
parental cells was evaluated as previously reported [48].
Doubling time (DT) was calculated with the formula:
DT = (t2–t1)/(log2N2-log2N1), where t1 and t2 are the times
at which the cells were counted, and N1 and N2 are the cells
numbers at times t1 and t2.

Microarray experiments

The search for new drugs with anti-papillomavirus
activity is urgently needed since, up to now, no
chemotherapeutic agent has been brought to the market
for the specific management of HPV-induced lesions.
Although CDV has proven efficacious in the therapy
of HPV-associated diseases, it has some limitations,

cytidine (Cyd) for 72 h. Cells were trypsinized, collected
by centrifugation, and subjected to cell lysis. To determine
the nucleotide pools, the extracts were submitted to HPLC
analysis on an anion exchange column [PartiSphere SAX
column (4.3 mm × 125 mm), Whatman] followed by UV
spectroscopy. In parallel, 5 µCi per flask of radioactive
[5-3H] labeled Urd or Cyd, supplemented in the growth
medium of the parental and CDVR cells were used to
investigate UTP and CTP biosynthesis at 6 h and 24 h after
addition of the nucleosides.

Antiproliferative activity

Site-directed mutagenesis of UMP/CMPK1

Inhibition of cell growth was determined following
7 days of incubation with the assessed drug as previously
described [49]. The antiproliferative effects were
expressed as CC50 (50% cystostatic concentration), which
is the concentration required to reduce cell growth by 50%
relative to the number of cells in untreated control cell
culture). Fold-resistance (FR) was calculated as the ratio
of CC50 for CDVR cells to CC50 for parental cells.

The P64T, R134M and P64T/R134M changes
were introduced in the pHL60-5 plasmid containing the
UMP/CMPK1 gene with a three step protocol using the
Quickchange Lightning Multi site-directed Mutagenesis kit
(Agilent technologies®). Primer(s) (Table S2) containing
the base change(s) were used to perform a PCR reaction
in order to produce mutant strands prior to enzymatic
digestion of the template with Dpn I. To amplify the
mutated plasmids, XL10 gold ultracompetent cells were
transformed. Sequencing of the full UMP/CMPK1 gene
from the recombinant plasmid was performed on both
strands to exclude any additional mutation.

Genotyping of UMP/CMPK1, UMP/CMPK2,
HPV E6 and E7
Total mRNA from parental and CDVR cells was
isolated with the Quickprep mRNA purification kit
(Amersham Biosciences) and converted to cDNA with
the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). The
entire cDNA from each selected gene was amplified by
PCR using specific primers. The PCR products were
purified using PCR product purification kit (Roche)
and directly sequenced using a cycle-sequencing kit
(Dyenamic dye terminator kit; Amersham Biosciences),
specific primers targeting both strands of the specific gene,
and a capillary DNA sequencing system (MegaBACE 500;
Amersham Biosciences). The data were assembled and
compared to the DNA sequences obtained from reference
sequences using Vector NTI software (Invitrogen). The
primers used for the genotyping of UMP/CMPK1 and 2,
and HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 are listed in Table S2.

Expression, purification and enzymatic activity
measurement of recombinant UMP/CMPKs
The wild-type and mutant UMP/CMPK1s were
produced in Escherichia coli [strain BL21 Rosetta®
(DE3) pLysS (Novagen)] as previously reported [14].
For protein purification, cells were broken by sonication
and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 g and 4°C. The
supernatant was added onto a column containing
2 ml Ni-Nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA) (Qiagen,
Benelux). Protein elution was performed using increasing
concentrations of imidazol and fractions were collected
and pooled for dialysis. Protein purity was analyzed
by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
in denaturing conditions. The catalytic activity of the
recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of human
UMP/CMPK1 was determined using a previously
described method [16] based on ADP formation [50].

CDV metabolism
[5-3H]-radiolabeled CDV (Moravek) was used
to assess the metabolism and drug incorporation into
cellular nucleic acid material in parental and CDVR cells.
The assay was performed with 10 µM of CDV for 24 h,
a protocol adapted to the one described previously [12].
All experiments were performed in duplicate.

Circular dichroism
All circular dichroism (CD) spectra measurements
were acquired using a JOBIN-YVON CD6
spectropolarimeter as previously described [51]. CD
measurements are reported as Dε (M–1.cm–1). The relative
helix content was deduced according to Zhong and
Johnson as the percent of helix = [Dε222nm × –10], where
Dε222nm is the dichroic increment at 222 nm per residue
[52]. Thermal denaturation curves of UMP/CMPK1s
were obtained by monitoring Δe at 222 nm as a function

Structural model for the amino acid changes in
human UMP-CMPK1
The role of the amino acid changes identified in the
human UMP-CMPK1 in SiHaCDV cells was investigated
by building a model of the enzyme complexed to ADP and
CMP based on the published three-dimensional structure
of the Dictyostelium discoideum UMP-CMPK (pdb code:
2UKD). Pymol Delano software was used to introduce the
identified mutations and to visualize the generated models.
A comparison of the open conformation of the human
enzyme free of substrate (pdb code: 1TEV) and the closed
conformation obtained by modeling was performed to
predict the impact of the P64T mutation. All figures were
generated using PyMol software.
