Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cancer cells exhibit several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cell growth and
proliferation. Specifically, they over-express the M2 isoform of the tightly regulated enzyme
pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which controls glycolytic flux, and they are highly dependent on de
novo biosynthesis of serine and glycine. Here we describe a novel rheostat-like mechanistic
relationship between PKM2 activity and serine biosynthesis. We show that serine can bind to and
activate human PKM2 and that following serine deprivation, PKM2 activity in cells is reduced.
This reduction in PKM2 activity shifts cells to a fuel-efficient mode where more pyruvate is
diverted to the mitochondria and more glucose derived carbon is channelled into serine
biosynthesis to support cell proliferation.
Metabolic fluxes in cancer cells are different from those in non-transformed cells1. In
particular, a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis has been
demonstrated, which is promoted by the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PK)2. PKM2
catalyses the final step of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, PKM2, which is the predominant isoform in cancer

cells3,4, has low basal enzymatic activity compared to the constitutively active splice-variant
PKM15. Another metabolic pathway recently demonstrated to be crucial for cancer cell
survival is the serine biosynthesis pathway6-8. We investigated a potential mechanistic link
between the two pathways in cancer cells, whereby a reduction of overall PK activity via the
preferential expression of PKM2 would cause the build-up of glycolytic intermediates for
channelling into the serine biosynthetic pathway. To test this hypothesis, we employed
human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells, which predominantly express the PKM2 isoform
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Two discrete shRNA pools were used to generate two
independent HCT116-derived cell lines (shPKMa and shPKMb) in which the expression of
both the PKM1 and PKM2 isoforms was simultaneously and stably silenced (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 2c). Despite achieving greater than 90 % reduction in PKM1/2 mRNA
and protein levels compared to cells expressing non-targeting shRNA (shCntrl), no
compensatory transcriptional induction of the PKL/R isoforms was observed in the shPKM
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). In line with this, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) analysis of the steady-state levels of metabolites revealed a 100-fold increase in
PEP concentration in shPKM cells accompanied by ~50 % decrease in pyruvate levels,
demonstrating a reduction in intracellular PK activity (Fig. 1b). The stable silencing of
PKM1/2 in HCT116 cells did not alter cell proliferation rates or steady-state levels of ATP
(Fig. 1c-d). In contrast, the proliferation rates of HT29 and SW620 colon cancer cells were
more sensitive to PKM1/2 silencing (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Regardless of the effect on
cellular proliferation rates, PKM1/2 silencing universally increased the oxygen consumption
rates (OCR) by ~30 %, with a corresponding decrease in the extracellular acidification rates
(ECAR), indicators of increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased glycolysis,
respectively (Supplemental Fig. 3b-c). Since PK catalyses an important ATP-producing step
in glycolysis, the stability of intracellular ATP levels could be explained by this
compensatory increase in oxidative phosphorylation in response to PKM1/2 silencing. Thus,
despite the predominant expression of PKM2 in HCT116 cells, these cells still exhibit
sufficient PK activity to convert PEP to pyruvate and to facilitate aerobic glycolysis.

Whilst PKM silencing caused a large increase in PEP concentration, pyruvate levels were
decreased to a lesser extent (Fig. 1b). There are several possible explanations for this.
Firstly, residual PKM could still generate pyruvate, albeit at a lower rate. Secondly, pyruvate
can be synthesised from carbon sources other than glucose. Finally, pyruvate can also be
generated from PEP via a PK-independent mechanism9, although this alternative pathway
was not elevated in the knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 4).
In order to study the fate of glucose in PKM-inhibited cells shCntrl and shPKM cells were
incubated in media containing uniformly 13C-labelled glucose (U-13C-glucose) and cells
were extracted at different time points. Several glucose-derived metabolites were tracked by
LC-MS (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5), including pyruvate and PEP. The ratio between
these two metabolites at an early time point after glucose labelling was validated as a
reliable measure of PKM2 activity using an activator of PKM2 (Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6
and Supplementary discussion).
In the cytosol, pyruvate is metabolised to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the
resulting lactate contains three glucose-derived carbons. In addition, pyruvate is translocated
to the mitochondria where it is oxidised and decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA which enters the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to form citrate, contributing two carbon atoms from glucose.
When cells were incubated with U-13C-glucose, both glucose-derived lactate and citrate
were detected by LC-MS (13C3-Lactate and 13C2-Citrate). Blocking PKM1/2 activity shifted
the metabolism of glucose away from lactate production in the cytosol to citrate production
in the mitochondria (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Heavier isotopomers of citrate
(particularly 13C4-Citrate) were detected in cells incubated for a longer time (4 hours) with

U-13C-glucose, an indication of further oxidation and generation of citrate in the TCA cycle
(Supplementary Fig. 7). These results are in line with the observed increase in oxygen
consumption of shPKM cells (Supplementary Fig. 3).

An increased metabolic flux into the serine and glycine biosynthetic pathway was also
observed in cells with reduced PK activity, as determined by the accumulation of glucosederived 13C in these amino acids (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5). This is the first direct
evidence that low PK activity can drive serine and glycine biosynthesis, and demonstrates an
important link between key metabolic processes observed in cancer, namely preferential
PKM2 expression, aerobic glycolysis and serine biosynthesis. The relative contribution of
glucose-derived carbons to serine and glycine is low (Supplementary Fig. 7), which is
attributable to the presence of unlabelled serine and glycine in the growth media of the cells.
Indeed, when cells were incubated for 12 hours in serine- and glycine-free media, more than
80 % of the intracellular serine and glycine was glucose-derived (Supplementary Fig. 8a).
Nevertheless, de novo synthesis of serine and glycine in cells starved of these two amino
acids was insufficient to recover their steady-state levels (Fig. 3a), indicating a rapid
utilisation of newly-synthesised amino acids. Importantly, the absence of extracellular serine
and glycine had a pronounced inhibitory effect on PK activity, as demonstrated by a 100 %
increase in PEP and a 30 % decrease in pyruvate (Fig. 3a). Akin to PKM1/2 silencing, serine
deprivation reduced cytosolic lactate production and increased mitochondrial citrate
production by ~ 60 % (Fig. 3a). Moreover, cellular deprivation of serine and glycine for 12
hours followed by 30 minutes incubation with U-13C-glucose resulted in a 50 % decrease in
the labelled pyruvate/PEP ratio (Fig. 3b). These data indicate that serine and glycine
deprivation decreases PKM2 activity in cells, such that more glucose-derived carbon is
channelled into serine and glycine biosynthesis.

PKM2 is a tightly regulated enzyme which responds not only to the availability of PEP and
ADP substrates, but also to the upstream glycolytic metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
(FBP) and to phosphorylation events10-14. Previous studies proposed that PK activity may
be regulated by amino acids15-17. Therefore, the ability of serine or glycine to stimulate
PKM2 in cells was tested. Serine hydroxymethyl transferase converts serine to glycine and
vice versa, therefore cells were starved of both amino acids overnight prior to 30 minutes
incubation with either serine or glycine. The cells incubated with serine or glycine showed
an increase in the intracellular levels of the added amino acid only and the levels of the other
amino acid were unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 8b). When serine- and glycine-starved cells
were incubated for 30 minutes with serine together with U-13C-glucose, intracellular PK
activity was increased relative to the starved cells. However, glycine did not stimulate
intracellular PK activity (Supplementary Fig. 8c).
In order to substantiate the results observed in cells, recombinant human PKM2 activity was
further analysed in vitro. Serine was demonstrated to activate recombinant PKM2 with a
half maximal activation concentration (AC50) of 1.3 mM (Fig. 4a), a level which is within
the physiological range of intracellular serine concentrations (Fig. 1b). Isothermal titration
calorimetry was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) of the PKM2-serine
interaction as 0.20 mM (Fig. 4b) and the titration curve was consistent with a (1:1) PKM2monomer: serine ratio. These results not only demonstrate direct interactions between serine
and PKM2, they also suggest that the serine concentration required for such interactions is
well within the physiological range of intracellular serine levels. In agreement with the
results observed in cells, glycine could not directly activate PKM2 in vitro (Fig. 4a).
Similarly to FBP, serine lowered the Km of PKM2 for PEP 2.3-fold, effectively increasing
the affinity of PKM2 for this substrate (Fig. 4c). Serine was found to be the only standard
amino acid that could activate PKM2 (Supplementary Fig. 9a). A fragment-based
crystallographic screen18 versus human PKM2 revealed the amino acids L-alanine, L-

cysteine, L-threonine and L-serine bound to a previously uncharacterised binding pocket on
PKM2. Crystallographic soaking experiments revealed L-serine bound to PKM2, with a
single L-serine molecule bound to each of the monomers comprising the PKM2 tetramer
(Fig. 4d and Supplementary Tables 1-2). L-serine made multiple hydrogen bonding
interactions with PKM2 (see Supplementary Fig. 9 and supplementary discussion).
Additional interactions afforded by the serine side chain hydroxyl group rationalise the low
affinity of glycine for PKM2 and may contribute to the unique ability of serine to activate
PKM216. The amino acid binding pocket was vacant in crystals not soaked with serine
(Supplementary Fig. 9b).
Based on the above observations, a recombinant H464A PKM2 mutant was produced and
demonstrated neither direct binding to, nor activation by, serine (Fig. 4b and e). These data
confirm that the amino acid binding site identified in the soaking experiments is the only
amino acid binding site on the PKM2 protein. Despite its inability to bind serine, the H464A
PKM2 mutant was activated by FBP in a similar way to wild-type PKM2. Conversely, a
S437Y mutant of PKM2, which cannot bind FBP19, was activated by serine (Fig. 4e-f).
These results demonstrate that PKM2 is independently activated by either FBP or serine,
and that, both molecules could contribute to PKM2 regulation in response to glucose and/or
amino acid deprivation in vivo. PKM2 regulation by serine in tumours is important as the
serine concentration in the blood is ~20-fold below that of glucose, hence under interrupted
blood supply, a significant deficit in serine supply would occur. Serine is crucial for multiple
metabolic pathways required for cell growth and proliferation, including phospholipid,
purine and glutathione biosynthesis, as well as being a methyl source for single carbon
metabolism. Additionally, serine levels are depleted at the periphery of solid tumours, hence
de novo serine biosynthesis is critical for tumour growth20,21.

The allosteric regulation of PK is associated with complex structural changes10,13,22.
Phosphorylation of Tyr105, adjacent to Arg106 in the serine binding pocket, has been shown
to modulate PKM2 activity and FBP binding11, and oxidation of Cys358, which is proximal
to the serine binding pocket, inhibits PKM223 (Supplementary Fig. 9e). This suggests that
the PKM2 serine binding pocket, and proximal residues, constitute a key structural
regulatory node for PKM2.
The predominant isoform of PK in cancer cells is PKM2, however, the serine binding site
identified here is conserved in PKM1 and PKL/R. Therefore, the possibility that serine may
be a universal PK regulator was tested in vitro. PKM1 demonstrated a high degree of basal
activity in the absence of exogenous activators, and was refractory to both FBP and serine
activation (Fig. 4g). In contrast, PKL/R was completely inactive in its basal state and was
robustly activated by FBP. Surprisingly, PKL/R was not activated by serine (Fig. 4h). These
results suggest that only PKM2-expressing cells can respond to changes in serine
availability and support shuttling of glucose-derived carbon into serine biosynthesis upon
serine deprivation.
This work provides a new understanding of the relationship between glucose and amino acid
metabolism. Serine biosynthesis is an anabolic pathway required for growth and
proliferation24. However, it recruits carbon away from the energy production pathway of
glucose utilisation. Here, for the first time, we present an elucidation of the mechanism that
tightly controls the metabolic bifurcation of glucose-derived carbon. The control of PKM2
activity through serine availability provides a rheostat-like mechanism. When serine is
abundant, PKM2 is fully active enabling the maximal use of glucose via glycolysis.
However, when the steady-state levels of serine drop below a critical point, an immediate
attenuation of PKM2 activity occurs. This enables the fast shuttling of glucose-derived
carbon to serine biosynthesis, compensating for the serine shortfall and enabling growth and

proliferation in the absence of these amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 1). Finally, by
activating PKM2, serine supports aerobic glycolysis and lactate production, events that are
critical for cancer cell growth and survival.

1×106 cells were plated onto 6 cm plates in triplicates and cultured in standard medium
(DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine). Two additional plates were grown as counter plates.
The medium was replaced after 24 hours by 10 ml of fresh standard medium, and cells were
incubated for another 24 hours before extraction (as described in the following section).
Standard compounds were weighed separately and dissolved together in water to make
solution A (where each metabolite has a concentration between 1 mM and 10 mM). 1 ml of
solution A was added to 49 ml of dilution solvent (50:50 acetonitrile: water) to make stock
solution B (where each metabolite had a concentration between 20 μM and 200 μM). For
quantification, cells or media extracts (200 μl) were mixed with 800 μl of dilution solvent,
containing 0, 4, 20, 100, 300 or 500 μl of stock solution B. Dilutions were analysed by LCMS. The concentration of each metabolite in the extract was calculated according to the

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

4×105 cells were plated onto 6 well plates and cultured in standard medium for 24 hours.
The medium was then replaced by 2 ml of fresh medium containing 5 mM unlabelled
glucose and 3 hours later 5 mM of U-13C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc)
was added; alternatively, medium was replaced by 2 ml of fresh medium with U-13Cglucose only. Cells were incubated for the indicated time prior to extraction. For extraction,
cells were washed twice in PBS and metabolites were extracted on a dry ice/methanol bath
in a 50:30:20 ratio of methanol:acetonitrile:water and quickly scraped. The insoluble
material was spun down in a cooled centrifuge at 16000g for 15 minutes at 0°C and the
supernatant was collected for subsequent LC-MS analysis. The volume of extraction
solution was calculated according to cell number and, extrapolated using a “counter dish”
cultured under the same experimental conditions as the sample dishes. A volume of 1 ml of
extraction solutions per 2×106 cells was used. Metabolites were separated using a liquid
chromatography system. A ZIC-pHILIC column (4.6 mm×150 mm, guard column 4.6
mm×10 mm, Merck, Germany) was used for LC separation using gradient elution with a
solution of 20 mM ammonium carbonate, with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide, and acetonitrile.
Detection of metabolites was performed using a Thermo Scientific Exactive high resolution
mass spectrometer with electrospray (ESI) ionization, examining metabolites in both
positive and negative ion modes, over the mass range of 75-1000 m/z.
2D gel electrophoresis
shPKM and control HCT116 cells were lysed precipitated and resuspended as described in
Vander Heiden et al, 20109. IEF was performed using ZOOM strips pH 3-10NL according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). After IEF strips were equilibrated in buffer
containing 10 mg/ml DTT and subsequently in buffer containing 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide
prior to SDS-PAGE. As negative control, shPKM HCT116 cells were lysed and precipitated
in acetone and the pH adjusted to pH5 by the addition of 1% acetic acid. This removed any
acid labile phosphates such as phospho-Histidine. PGAM1 and its phosphorylated forms
were detected by Western blot using goat anti-PGAM1 (Novus) 1:1000 and Donkey antiGoat (Licor) 1:1000 antibodies.

performed in the presence of FBP. The Kd value for L-serine binding was significantly
higher than the PKM2 concentration used, making it difficult to accurately determine the
stoichiometry value. Therefore, the stoichiometry parameter was fixed at 1 for the purpose
of data analysis using the single site binding model in Origin 7.0.
PKM2 X-ray Crystallography
A publically available human PKM2 expression construct was obtained from the Structural
Genomics Consortium (SGC). His6-hPKM2 was purified using NiNTA affinity capture and
Hiload Superdex 16/60 S75 size exclusion chromatography. hPKM2 was crystallised using
hanging drop vapour diffusion. Protein solution 10 mg/ml, 25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 M
KCL, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol was mixed in a (1:1) ratio with reservoir solution
containing 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 M ammonium tartrate, 24% (w/v) PEG3350. Crystals were
soaked overnight in a solution containing 30 mM L-Serine, cryo protected and flash frozen
in liquid N2. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at 100K at
Beamline-I03 at the Diamond Light Source. Diffraction data were processed using XDS
AutoPROC from Global Phasing and SCALA (CCP4)27. Molecular replacement was
performed using model 3H6O (SGC) in CSEARCH28 and maximum likelihood refinement
carried out using a mixture of automated (see29 & refs therein) and manual refinement
protocols employing Refmac (CCP4) and AutoBuster from Global Phasing. Ligand fitting
was performed using Autosolve28 and manual rebuilding. Simulated annealing was not
employed. The four PKM2 monomers comprising the tetramer in the asymmetric unit were
refined as independent entities, but NCS restraints were imposed in AutoBuster using the
‘ncsauto’ command. Refinement of the structure in the absence of NCS restraints gave
(Rf=23.7, R=17.7) and with ‘ncsauto’ gave (Rf=22.7, R=17.9), showing a small, but
significant, reduction in Rf using ‘ncsauto’ restraints. At the ‘effective resolution’ of 2.36Å

there are ~86000 unique reflections. The refinement included ~16600 non-hydrogen atoms.
B-factors were refined isotropically giving a total of ~66500 parameters for all nonhydrogen atoms in the PKM2 tetramer. The four serine molecules were refined as
independent ligands. Details of ligand occupancies, B-factors etc are tabulated in the
crystallographic data tables (Supplementary Tables 1-2)30-33.

PKM2 Mutagenesis
hPKM2 point mutant constructs were generated using a Stratagene QuikChange II site
directed mutagenesis kit (#200524). PCR protocols were as defined in the product manual.
The following forward DNA primers, and their reverse complemented primer counterparts,
were used for the mutagenesis reactions (sequence of mutated bases shown in uppercase
bold): H464A: 5′gctcgtcaggccGCcctgtaccgtggc3′, S437Y:
5′accaagtctggcaggtAtgctcaccaggtgg3′. Primers were purchased from Sigma (UK). The
previously described SGC hPKM2 construct was used as the DNA template within the PCR
reactions. The presence of the point mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the
DNA constructs (Beckman Coulter Genomics Inc., Takeley, UK) and in-house LC-MS of
the purified recombinant proteins. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified
identically to the wild type protein.
Statistical analyses
The data (mean ± s.e.m.) are representative of 3-5 independent experiments, performed in
technical triplicates if not differently indicated. Data were analysed and presented with
Graphpad Prism 5.01 software (GraphPad Software Inc, CA, USA).
Data Processing

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The data processing workflow started by first converting the vendor specific raw data files
from the mass spectrometer into the mzXML open data format34, using the msconvert utility
from the ProteoWizard Library and Tools collection35 (http://
proteowizard.sourceforge.net/). The set of all chromatographic peaks in each of the
converted raw files were then extracted using the CentWave36 feature detection algorithm
from XCMS37. The resulting data were stored in the PeakML file format38, and the rest of
the processing was handled by the scriptable mass spectrometry data processing tool
mzmatch.R39 (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/).
The next step in the workflow involved aligning and combining the chromatographic
features between biological replicates of a single sample. The PeakML files thus created
were subjected to an additional filtering procedure to discard all peaks that were not
reproducibly detected in all biological replicates involved. Chromatographic peaks of
individual samples were then aligned together based on their retention time and m/z values,
and combined into a single PeakML file. Peak sets that do not include peaks from every
sample were filled in by extracting ion chromatograms within the retention time and mass
window of the corresponding peak set directly from the raw data files. From these peak sets,
only those that had more peaks than the number of replicates minus one were selected for
further analysis. Putative identification of the peak sets were made by matching the detected
masses to that of the compounds relevant to this study. Isotope peaks were extracted by
identifying the peaks that fell in the retention time window of the identified unlabelled peak
and correspond to the estimated mass window (2 ppm) of the isotope. All isotope
identification and quantification of the ratios were performed by the
PeakML.Isotope.TargettedIsotopes() function of the mzmatch.R library. Detailed
documentation and tutorials for which are available at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/
isotopes targetted.html.
