ABSTRACT
Velcade is one of the inescapable drug to treat patient suffering from multiple
myeloma (MM) and resistance to this drug represents a major drawback for patients.
However, the mechanisms underlying velcade resistance remain incompletely
understood. We derived several U266 MM cell clones that resist to velcade. U266resistant cells were resistant to velcade-induced cell death but exhibited a similar
sensitivity to various proapoptotic stimuli. Careful analysis of proteosomal subunits
and proteasome enzymatic activities showed that neither the composition nor the
activity of the proteasome was affected in velcade-resistant cells. Elimination of
velcade-induced poly-ubiquitinated proteins and protein aggregates was drastically
stimulated in the resistant cells and correlated with increased cell survival. Inhibition
of the lysosomal activity in velcade-resistant cells resulted in an increase of cell
aggregates and decrease survival, indicating that aggregates are eliminated through
lysosomal degradation. In addition, pangenomic profiling of velcade-sensitive and
resistant cells showed that the small heat shock protein HSPB8 was overexpressed in
resistant cells. Finally, gain and loss of function experiment demonstrated that HSPB8
is a key factor for velcade resistance. In conclusion, HSPB8 plays an important role
for the elimination of aggregates in velcade-resistant cells that contributes to their
enhanced survival.

INTRODUCTION

this process is essential for maintaining normal cellular
function. In cancer cells, proteasome is also required for
the tumor cell growth, angiogenesis and apoptosis [4].
Proteasome inhibition has emerged as a new therapeutic
option against cancer [5]. Bortezomib (PS341, velcade)
is the first proteasome inhibitor that has been approved
for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), resulting

in outstanding response rate in both relapsed/refractory
and newly diagnosed MM patients [6, 7]. Velcade is a
reversible inhibitor that target primarily the β5-subunit
(PSMB5) subunit/chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity of
the 26S proteasome and to a lesser extend the β1 (PSMB6)
subunit/caspase-like activity. At higher concentrations,
velcade also inhibits the trypsin-like activity harbored by
the β2 (PSMB7) proteasome subunit [8]. Velcade disrupts
the equilibrium between protein biosynthesis and protein
degradation, which results in cell death by apoptosis.
Proteasome inhibition leads to the accumulation of
damaged proteins in the intracellular environment which
causes endoplasmic reticulum overload integrated as an
ER stress [9]. Then the cell induces protective responses,
so called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that
promotes refolding or elimination of damaged proteins.
If the accumulation of damaged proteins is excessive, cell
can at last triggers apoptosis through CHOP, caspase-4 and
caspase-12 activation. It was also reported that proteasome
inhibition triggers apoptosis by affecting the levels of
many regulatory proteins, resulting in inhibition of nuclear
factor κB (NF-κB), increased activity P53 and Bax leading
to the activation of c-Jun NH2 –terminal kinase (JNK),
which in turn activates caspase-8 and caspase-3 [10].
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell
malignancy [11] that remains incurable despite
conventional treatment [12] or high-dose therapy [13]. It
has a prevalence of 50 000 patients in the United States,
occurring in approximately 16 000 new individuals each
year. Autologous stem cell transplantation remains a good
option for treating this disease; however, all patients will
unavoidably relapse. Therefore, considerable efforts have
been devoted to the development of new therapeutic
strategies for the treatment of patients suffering from
MM. Drugs such as lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and
bortezomib (Velcade®) have significantly improved the
overall survival rates of patients [14]. Despite promising
clinical activity, some patients with MM failed to respond
to velcade therapy or respond briefly and relapse [15].
The mechanism of velcade resistance remains puzzling.
In lymphoma cells, high constitutive expression of
heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) was reported to confer
resistance to velcade [16]. In the context of acquired
resistance to velcade, two previous studies reported
an enhanced cellular efflux via the overexpression of
multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter P-glycoprotein
(Pgp; ABCB1; MDR1) [17] or multidrug resistancerelated protein 1 (MRP1;ABCC1) [18] in ovarian cells.
To date, different individual cell lines (including MM cell
lines) have been adapted to increased concentrations of
velcade [19-24]. In most of these studies, mutations in the
active center of the β5 polypeptide have been repeatedly
reported (G322A, C323T, C326T), that either lead or
not to increased chymotryptic activity with or without
overexpression of individual proteasome subunits.
In the present study, we derived several U266
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MM cell clones that resist to velcade. U266-resistant
cell clones were fully resistant to velcade-induced cell
death compared to their sensitive parental counterpart
but exhibited a similar sensitivity to a large spectrum
of proapoptotic stimuli. Neither the composition nor
the activity of the proteasome was affected in velcaderesistant cells. Importantly, elimination of velcade-induced
poly-ubiquinated proteins and protein aggregates was
drastically stimulated in resistant cells and correlated with
an increase in cell survival in the presence of the drug.
Inhibition of the lysosomal activity in velcade-resistant
cells resulted in a diminution of cell aggregates and
increased survival, indicating that protein aggregates are
eliminated through lysosomal degradation. In addition,
pangenomic profiling of velcade-sensitive and resistant
cell lines showed that the small heat shock protein HSPB8
was overexpressed in resistant cells. Finally, gain and loss
of function experiment demonstrated that HSPB8 is a key
factor for velcade resistance. In conclusion, these findings
establish for the first time that HSPB8 plays an important
role for the elimination of cell aggregates in velcaderesistant cells that contributes to their enhanced survival.

RESULTS
Generation and characterization of multiple
myeloma cell lines resistant to velcade
To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of
resistance to conventional therapies in MM, we generated
U266 cell clones resistant to velcade, one of the leading
drug to treat patients suffering from MM. For that
purpose, the U266 cell line was incubated with iterative
and increasing concentrations of velcade for a long
period of time. After 10 months of selection we generated
a bulk of U266 cells that resist up 20 nM velcade. In a
first set of experiments, we determined the sensitivity
of these cells to velcade using the XTT cell metabolism
assay. Supplementary Figure 1A showed the loss of cell
metabolism induced by increasing concentrations of
velcade on the bulk of U266 cells rendered resistant to
10, 12.5, 15 or 20 nM of this proteasome inhibitor. In the
control cells, the IC50 value for velcade was around 2
nM, whereas 10-20 nM of the drug was required to inhibit
50% of cell metabolism in the bulk of U266 cells. After
serial dilutions, we obtained several U266 cell clones
from the bulk of cells resistant to 20 nM velcade. In the
U266 sensitive cell clones, the IC50 value for the velcadeinduced loss of cell metabolism was 4-5 nM compared to
25-30 nM in the bulk of U266 resistant cells and clone
U266R9 (Supplementary Figure 1B). Two clones namely,
U266R6 and U266R11 were found to be highly resistant to
velcade, with IC50 values of 80 and 100 nM, respectively.
For all the forthcoming experiments we thus

U266 and R6 cells are sensitive to various
proapoptotic stimuli but resistant to different
proteasome inhibitors

decided to use the U266R6 clone (R6) that exhibited
an intermediary resistance (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Resistance of the R6 cells to increasing doses of velcade
after 24 or 48 h of treatment was further confirmed by the
loss of cell metabolism induced by velcade (Figure 1A).
Whatever the incubation time, there was a twenty fold
increase in the concentration of velcade needed to induce
a 50% loss of cell metabolism in R6 cells compared to
their U266 counterparts (Figure 1A). There was also an
excellent correlation between the loss of cell metabolism
in U266 and R6 cells and velcade-mediated cell death
assessed by the propidium iodide staining at 48 h (Figure
1B) or the increase in caspase-3 specific enzymatic activity
at 24 h (Figure 1C). Accordingly, caspase-3 activation and
Poly-ADR Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage were also
visualized after 24 h or 48 h of velcade treatment in U266
parental cells, but only poorly detected in their velcaderesistant counterpart (Figure 1D).

We next investigated the effect of various
proapoptotic stimuli on U266 and R6 cells. To this purpose
both cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations
of either staurosporine or melphalan, an alkylating agent
routinely used for the treatment of MM for 24 h. The same
cell lines were also incubated with various concentrations
of thapsigargin and tunicamycin, two reticulum stress
inducing agents or etoposide for 48h, because we
established in preliminary experiments that a longer time
of treatment with these three later drugs was necessary to
induce a significant loss of cell metabolism in velcadetreated cells. As expected, R6 cells exhibited a strong
resistance to high concentrations of velcade (Figure 2A).
Of note, U266 and R6 cells showed the same sensitivity
to all the proapoptotic stimuli used, including melphalan
(Figure 2B to F). Therefore, we concluded that R6 cells
exhibited a selective resistance to velcade but not to other
proapoptotic stimuli.
To investigate whether R6 cells could exhibit a
general resistance to proteasome inhibitors, we next
look for the effect of clasto-lactacystin, adamanthane
(proteosomal β subunit inhibitor), MG132 and
epoxomycin in comparison with the effect of velcade.
As shown on supplementary Figure 2, besides velcade,
R6 cells were also highly resistant to clasto-lacatcystin
and MG132 and to a lesser extent to adamanthane and
epoxomycin, suggesting a global resistance to a large
panel of proteasome inhibitors.

with increasing concentrations of velcade (1 to 100 nM) for 24 h
(left panel) or 48 h (right panel). Then, the cells were collected
and cell viability was assessed with the XTT cell metabolism
assay. B, U266 and R6 cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of velcade (1 to 100 nM) for 48 h (left panel) or
72 h (right panel). Then, the cells were harvested and incubated
with Propidium iodide (PI), and the percentage of dead cells
was assessed by flow cytometry. C, U266 and R6 cells were
incubated with increasing concentrations of velcade (1 to 100
nM) for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected and lysed in caspase
buffer, and caspase activity was assessed using DEVD-AFC as
substrate. D, U266 and and R6 cell lines were incubated with
velcade (10 nM) for 1 h to 48 h. Then, the cells were collected,
washed and lysed, and total protein extracts were subjected to
SDS-PAGE immunoblot using anti-Parp, anti-Caspase-3 and
anti-P42/44 antibodies.

indicated times. Then, the cells were collected, and cell viability

U266 and R6 cells exhibit the same proteasomal
enzymatic activity

the different proteolytic activities constitutive of the
proteasome could contribute to the resistance of R6 cells
to this drug. The dose-response curves for the inhibition
by velcade of the caspase-like and chymotrypsin-like
activities were superposable in U266 and R6 cells (Figure
3C left and middle panels). In addition, as previously
reported, velcade failed to inhibit tryspsin-like activity of
the proteasome, (Figure 3C, right panel). In conclusion,
our findings clearly demonstrate that the intrinsic activity
of the proteasome is identical in U266 and R6 cells.
Accordingly, expression of the different protease subunits
of the proteasome (PSMB5, PSMB6 and PSMB7) was
found to be similar in both cell lines (supplementary
Figure 3A). As point mutations in the PSMB5 protein
has been previously identified in some velcade-resistant
cells [19, 21, 22, 24], we looked for potential mutations in
this proteasome subunit. We were unable to detect neither
this particular mutation nor any other ones in the PSMB5
subunit present in R6 cells (supplementary Figure 3B).
Therefore, we conclude that the nature or the activity of
the proteasome is unaffected in our velcade-resistant U266
cell line.

The proteasome consists on three main enzymatic
activities including pseudo-caspase-like / glutamyl
transferase,
chymotrypsin-like
and
trypsin-like
proteolytic activities that can be assessed using the
synthetic fluorescent substrates, Z-Leu-leu-Glu-AMC,
Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC and Ac-Arg-Leu-ArgAMC, respectively (Figure 3A). As illustrated on Figure
3B, the global activity (i.e in the absence of velcade)
of the proteasome was identical in U266 and R6 cells.
The caspase-like and chymotrypsin-like activities were
found to be similarly sensitive to velcade and to their
specific proteasome inhibitors (MG132 and epoxomycin
for the caspase-like and chymotrypsin-like activities,
respectively) (Figure 3B left and middle panel). The
tryspin-like activity in both cell lines was insensitive to
velcade but sensitive to Tlck, an inhibitor of trypsin-like
activities (Figure 3B right panel). Finally, we investigated
whether small difference in sensitivity to velcade of

substrates used to measure the caspase-like and the chymotrypsin-like, and the trypsin-like activities of the proteasome. B, U266 and R6
cells were incubated with either velcade (10 nM), MG132 (1 µM), Epoxomycin (100 nM) or Tlck (100 µM) for 24 h. Then, the cells were
collected, washed and lysed, and proteasome activities were measured using the specific AMC conjugated substrates. C, U266 and R6 cells
were collected, washed and lysed, and normalized protein extracts were incubated with increasing concentrations of velcade (1 to 300 nM)
with either MG132 (1 µM), Epoxomycin (100 nM) or Tlck (100 µM) for 1 h. Then, the cell lysates were collected and the proteasome
activities were measured using the specific AMC conjugated substrates.

R6 cells have lower levels of poly-ubiquitinated
proteins and aggregates

stimulated with H202 that is reported to induce cell death
and protein aggregates (Supplementary Figure 4). In U266
cells, increasing concentration of H202 induced a loss of
cell metabolism (left panel) that was associated with an
accumulation of protein aggregates (right panel). In R6
cells, the loss of cell metabolism was dampened and the
clearance of protein aggregates was increased. All together
our data strongly suggest that an increased clearance of
intracellular aggregates allows R6 cells to resist to the
effect of velcade.

It has been reported previously that Bortezomib
(velcade) induced protein aggregate accumulation into
the cytoplasm of the RPMI-8226 MM cell line [25]. Thus,
the total level of poly-ubiquitaned proteins was evaluated
in U266 and R6 cells after 24 or 48 h treatment with
increasing concentrations of velcade. For concentrations
of velcade ranging from 3 to 10 nM, there was a strong
inhibition of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in R6 cells. This
was particularly evident in R6 cells treated for 48 h with
velcade (Figure 4A). Reduction of poly-ubiquitinated
proteins in R6 cells is correlated with a significant gain
of cell metabolism after 24 or 48 h in the presence of
velcade concentrations ranging from 3 to 30 nM (Figure
4B). Finally, the clearance of intracellular aggregates
was increased in R6 cells compared to their sensitive
counterpart for the same range of velcade concentrations
(Figure 4B). To support the hypothesis that the resistance
of R6 cells was due to a higher capacity to eliminate
intracellular aggregates, both U266 and R6 cells were

Velcade increases the autophagic flux in resistant
cells and inhibition of lysosomal activity
overcomes resistance to velcade
Because inhibition of proteasome by velcade
triggers the aggresome/autophagy pathway leading to
the elimination of protein aggregates by lysosomes,
we first analysed the induction of autophagy following
velcade stimulation in both U266 clones. The LC3
protein is commonly used as a marker of autophagy.

Figure 4: Velcade-treated R6 clone exhibits decreased accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated protein and cellular
aggregates. A, U266 and R6 cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of velcade (3 to 100 nM) for 24 h (left panel) or 48 h
(right panel). Then the cells were collected and lysed, and normalized protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
using anti-polyubiquitin and anti-Tubulin antibodies. B, U266 and R6 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of velcade (3
to 100 nM) for 24 h (upper panels) or 48 h (lower panels). Then, the cells were collected and cell viability was assessed by the XTT cell
metabolism assay (left panels). In parallel, the percentage of cells with aggregates was determined by flow cytometry (right panels).

After proteolytic processing by Atg4, LC3 conjugaison
with phosphatidylethanolamine allows its insertion into
the autophagic vesicule membranes, thus promoting
autophagy. The abundance of processed LC3 (LC3-II)
serves as a surrogate indicator of autophagic activity.
As expected, we observed a slight increase of LC3
processing in both U266 and R6 cells treated with
increasing doses of velcade that was nevertheless more
robust in the R6 resistant clone (Figure 5A, upper panel).
We next investigated whether the R6 cells exhibits an
enhanced autophagic flux by using the combination
of E64 and Pepstatin that inhibits lysosomal protease
activities and consequently induces LC3-II accumulation.
We observed an accumulation of LC3-II in both clones
treated with E64 and Pepstatin indicating that the basal
autophagic flux is similar in U266 and R6 cells. When
proteasome and lysosome activities were inhibited by the
combination of velcade and E64/Pepstatin respectively,
LC3-II accumulation was maintained in the R6 resistant
clone, whereas it was inhibited in the U266 parental
clone. Quantification of LC3II processing confirmed
that when proteasomal and lysosomal activities were
inhibited, LC3-II accumulation was dampened in the
parental cell line, while it was maintained or ever slightly
increased in the resistant clone (Figure 5A). We next
analysed whether inhibition of lysosomal activity with
the combination of E64 and pepstatin would affect cell

viability and clearance of aggregates in U266 and R6
cells treated with increasing doses of velcade. E64 +
Pepstatin significantly increased the velcade-induced loss
of cell metabolism and accumulation of cell aggregates
in R6 cells after 24 h (Figure 5B and 5C). A similar
loss of velcade-mediated cell metabolism and increase
aggregate accumulation was observed in R6 cells treated
with Chloroquine (10 µM), another inhibitor of lysosomal
activity (Supplemental 5). R6 cells were also stimulated
with increasing concentrations of MG132 in the presence
or in absence of either Pep/E64 (Supplemental 6A) or
Bafilomycin A1, another inhibitor of lysosomal activity
(Supplemental 6B). Percentages of dead cells (upper
panels) or cell metabolism assay (lower panels) showed
that R6 cells were resistant to MG132 and that inhibition
of the lysosomal activity resensitized R6 cells to MG132.
Taken together, these data show that a better clearance of
cellular aggregates by the aggresome/autophagy pathway
upon velcade treatment is responsible for the increase
in cell metabolism and the resistance of R6 cells to cell
death.

Pangenomic profiling of U266 and R6 cells
To gain insights into the mechanisms of resistance
to velcade we next compared the transcriptome of U266
parental population with both the R6 clone and the

HSPB8 is upregulated in velcade-resistant clones
and is a key actor of resistance to this drug

initial bulk of resistant cells using whole genome human
microarrays. Table S1 illustrated the 160 most down and
up-regulated genes in the 2 resistant cell populations in
basal conditions. Importantly, as shown on Figure 6A
and 6B, we noticed a strong correlation between the
distribution of log2 fold change between the 2 resistant
cells, strongly suggesting that the gene profile found in
the R6 clone is highly representative of velcade resistance.
Among the genes modulated in R6 cells we focused on
HSPB8, whose expression was increased 5-6 times in R6
cells compared to their parental counterpart in microarray
data (Figure 6C). Interestingly, this gene has been shown
previously to be important for the clearance of aggregates.
This protein functions as a chaperone in association with
BAG3, a stimulator of macroautophagy, and favored
degradation of unfolded poly-ubiquitinated protein
through the lysosomal degradation pathway [26, 27].

Overexpression of the HSPB8 protein was
confirmed in R6 cells by western blotting (Figure 7A).
Importantly, HSP27 another heat shock protein was
present at the same level in U266 and R6 cells (Figure
7A). To disprove that increased expression of HSPB8
could be a clonal particularity of the R6 cell line, we
looked for its expression in the bulk of U266 resistant cells
and in the different U266 cell clones. As shown on figure
7B, we found a very good correlation between HSPB8
expression in the different clones and their sensitivity to
velcade (Figure 7B and supplementary Figure 1B).
Next, we wanted to determine whether velcade
can modulate HSPB8 expression level in U266 and R6
clones. In accordance with the pangenomic profiling,
RT-PCR experiment showed an increase in HSPB8
mRNA in R6 cells but not U266 cells in basal conditions
(Supplementary Figure 7). In R6 cells, increasing

concentrations of velcade led to a strong induction of
HSPB8 mRNA, while the proteasome inhibitor induced
a slight increase in HSPB8 mRNA expression at low dose
of velcade in U266 cells (Supplementary Figure 7A). In
R6 cells, induction of HSPB8 upon velcade treatment was
also confirmed at the protein level (Supplementary Figure
7B).
This prompted us to investigate further the role
of HSPB8 in the resistance to velcade. To this aim, we
performed gain and loss of function experiments in U266
and R6 cells, respectively (Figure 7C and D). We first
expressed myc-Tagged HSPB8 in U266 cells to a similar

level than endogenous HSPB8 in R6 cells (Figure 7C
upper panel). Increased expression of HSPB8 in R6 cells
further reduced the very weak loss of cell metabolism
induced by velcade. Importantly increased expression of
HSPB8 in U266 cells significantly protects them from
the velcade-induced loss of cell metabolism, whatever
the concentrations of the drug used (Figure 7C middle
panel). Indeed, transfected U266 cells that expressed the
same level of HSPB8 than their R6 counterpart exhibited
the same response to velcade. As expected, the resistance
of U266 cells to velcade conferred by HSPB8 expression
was correlated with a drastic diminution of cell aggregates

Figure 7: HSPB8 overexpression in R6 cells is responsible for the resistance to velcade. A, U266 and R6 cells were collected,

washed and lysed, and protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HSPB8, anti-HSP27 and anti-HSP60
antibodies. B, U266 and the various resistant clones obtained previously were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antiHSPB8, anti-HSP27 and anti-HSP60 antibodies. C, U266 and R6 cells were transfected with either control PcDNA3-Myc or PcDNA3Myc-HSPB8 vectors. 48 h later, one fraction of the cells were harvested and lysed. Exogenous Myc-HSPB8 protein (upper band) and
endogenous HSPB8 protein (lower band) level was quantified by western blotting using anti-HSPB8 antibody. Correct normalization of
protein extracts was confirmed using anti-HSP60 antibody (upper panel). The second fraction of the cells was stimulated with increasing
concentrations of velcade (5 to 20 nM) for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected and cell viability was assessed by the XTT cell metabolism
assay (middle panel). In parallel, the percentage of cells with aggregates was determined by flow cytometry (lower panel). D, U266 and R6
were transfected with either control siRNA or with HSPB8 siRNA. 48h later, one fraction of the cells was collected and lysed, and HSPB8
protein silencing was confirmed by western blotting using anti-HSPB8 antibody. Normalization of protein extracts was confirmed using
anti-HSP60 antibody (upper panel). The second portion of the cells was stimulated with increasing concentrations of velcade (5 to 20 nM)
for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the XTT cell metabolism assay (middle panel). In parallel, the percentage of cells with aggregates
was determined by flow cytometry (lower panel).

(Figure 7C lower panel).
To further confirm the implication of HSPB8 in the
resistance to velcade, we knocked down its expression
in U266 and R6 cells using a siRNA approach. Specific
silencing of HSPB8 in R6 cells was first confirmed
by Western Blotting (Figure 7D upper panel). HSPB8
silencing failed to affect the velcade-mediated loss of cell
metabolism in U266 cells conversely to cells treated with
the control siLuc, indicating the lack of global toxicity
of the HSPB8 siRNA. Importantly, HSPB8 knock down
in R6 cells restored sensitivity to velcade whatever the
concentrations used. At the higher concentrations of
velcade, the loss of cell metabolism reached two third of
the velcade effect in U266 cells (Figure 7D middle panel).
Notably, resensitization of R6 cells to velcade was closely
linked to a huge increase in cell aggregates (Figure 7D
lower panel). Gain and loss of function experiments were
also confirmed in the R11 resistant clone (Supplementary
Figure 8).
To confirm that HSPB8 overexpression inhibits
specifically the proteasome inhibitor-induced loss
of cell metabolism, we first expressed myc-Tagged
HSPB8 in U266 and R6 cells and stimulated clones
with either increasing concentrations of different
proteasome inhibitors or with various proapoptotic
stimuli (Supplemental Figure 9). As expected, in basal
conditions, while R6 cells exhibited a strong resistance to
the different proteasome inhibitors (panels A, B and C),
U266 and R6 cells showed the same sensitivity to all the
proapoptotic stimuli used (panels D, E and F). HSPB8
overexpression in U266 cells dampened the proteasome
inhibitor-induced loss of metabolism (panels A, B and C)
while it had no effect on proapoptotic stimuli-induced loss
of cell metabolism (panels D, E and F). Importantly, in R6
cells, HSPB8 overexpression reduced slightly the loss of
cell metabolism induced by proteasome inhibitors but had
no effect on proapoptotic stimuli-induced cell metabolism.
Overexpression of the myc-Tagged HSPB8 protein was
confirmed in U266 and R6 cells by western blotting
(panel G). Therefore, we concluded that overexpression
of HSPB8 conferred a selective resistance to proteasome
inhibitors but not to other proapoptotic stimuli.
Taken together our results highlight the key role of
HSPB8 in the resistance to velcade that is in agreement
with its capability to clear intracellular aggregates.

multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter P-glycoprotein
(Pgp) [17] or multidrug resistance-related protein 1
(MRP1) [18]. We excluded this possibility because i)
pangenomic profiling of velcade-sensitive and resistant
cell lines didn’t highlight an overexpression of PgP
transporter or MRP1 protein ii) parental U266 cells and the
different resistant clones described herein were similarly
sensitive to cell death inducers that act independently
of the proteasome inhibition. Resistance to etoposide or
thapsigargin was also reported to be linked to Pgp and
MRP1 overexpression respectively [28, 29]. This is not
the case in our velcade resistant cell lines in which are
sensitive to both effectors.
To investigate the mechanisms of velcade resistance
that occur frequently in hematopoietic malignancies,
several studies were conducted in velcade adapted
MM, myelomonocytic, promyelocytic, T lymphoblastic
lymphoma/leukemia or Burkitt lymphoma cells cell lines
[19-24, 30]. Authors reported mutations in the active
center of the β5 polypeptide (PSMB5), which either lead
or not to increased chymotryptic activity with or without
overexpression of individual proteasome subunits.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence of
mutations or overexpression of the PSMB5 proteasome
subunit has been reported in any case of myeloma patient
[31-34]. These results show that in myeloma patients
resistant to velcade, the direct implication of a proteasome
defect remains to be established.
In our models velcade resistant U266 MM clones
we failed to observe mutations or overexpression of
the PSMB5 core leading to an increased chymotryptic
activity. Moreover, no mutations or overexpression
of the PSMB6 or PSMB7 proteasome subunits that
could explain a reinforced caspase-like and trypsin-like
activities, were detected (Supplemental 3 and data not
shown). Using synthetic fluorescent substrates, we also
measured the caspase-like, chymotrypsin-like and trypsinlike proteolytic activities in either U266 or R6 cells or
in the corresponding cell lysates incubated or not with
velcade. We demonstrated that both U266 and R6 clones
exhibited similar basal chymotrypsin-like and caspaselike proteasome activities that were both sensitive to
inhibition by velcade. In conclusion, our findings rule out
the possibility that a modification in the intrinsic activity
of the proteasome can explain the resistance of the R6
clones to velcade.
One mechanism that could explain the difference
between our results and the one obtained from other
groups could be the concentrations of velcade used to
generate these U266 resistant clones. In the previous
studies, the authors used concentrations of velcade up to
1 µM to select their clones [19, 21, 22, 24]. In our case,
we did not exceed 20 nM because this concentration
corresponds to the dose commonly administered to
patients (1.3 mg/m2) [35]. It is thus reasonable to assume
that different resistance mechanisms are at play in the cells

DISCUSSION
The newly established velcade-resistant U266 MM
cell lines described in the present report exhibited a strong
cross-sensitivity to a wide panel of proteasome inhibitors
but remained sensitive to various proapoptotic stimuli.
These results indicate that R6 clones exhibit a selective
resistance to proteasome inhibitors. In the context of
acquired resistance to velcade, previous studies reported
an enhanced cellular efflux via the overexpression of

treated with low and high doses of velcade.
The aggresome/autophagy pathway is an important
process that is critical for the degradation of a plethora
of proteins via the lysosomes. This process is further
involved when the proteasome/ubiquitin pathway is
inhibited [36]. In our model, we observed accumulation
of both poly-ubiquitinated and protein aggregates in
both U266 and R6 cell lines stimulated with increased
concentrations of velcade (Figure 4). These results
confirmed that both cell lines engaged a similar upstream
molecular response following velcade challenging.
Then, we showed that elimination of velcade-induced
poly-ubiquitinated proteins and protein aggregates was
drastically stimulated in resistant cells and correlated
with an increased cell survival after 48 h in the presence
of the drug. Inhibition of the lysosomal activity with the
combination of E64 and Pepstatin (Figure 5B and C) or
Chloroquine (Supplemental 5) in velcade-resistant cells
resulted in an increase of cell aggregates and a decreased
survival, indicating that protein aggregates are eliminated
through the lysosomal pathway. Moreover, we showed
that resistant cells engaged a more robust induction of
autophagic flux upon velcade treatment compared to their
parental counterpart (Figure 5A and B). These results are
in agreement with findings from the literature reporting
that i/ Proteasome inhibition by velcade resulted in the
accumulation of ubiquitinated protein leading to protein
aggregation and proteotoxicity [25] ii/ Inhibition of the
proteasome by velcade triggers the aggresome/autophagy
pathway leading to the elimination of protein aggregates
by lysosomes [36, 37] and iii/ Inhibition of proteasome
and aggresome functions induces a synergistic antitumor
activity in MM [10, 38, 39]. To our knowledge and
importantly, this is the first description of a MM model of
velcade adapted-cells that reveals an enhance capacity to
degrade toxic protein aggregates through the aggresome/
autophagy pathway.
To investigate further the mechanism of resistance
to velcade, we next analyzed the alteration of gene
expression in U266 and R6 cells using an Affymetrix
pangenomic profiling. Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) have
been extensively described to be implicated in protein
quality control and the removal of misfolded proteins
[40]. The main machinery involves molecular chaperones
such as HSP70, HSP90 and small heat shock proteins (also
called HSPB) which can recognize and bind unfolded
proteins thereby preventing their aggregation. The fate of
their bound substrates (renaturation or degradation by the
aggresome/autophagy pathway) depends on the interaction
of HSP70 with specific cochaperones such as the E3 ligase
CHIP and the BAG domain containing proteins [41, 42].
We thus more specially focused on HSP protein family
expression in velcade-sensitive and resistant clones. From
the pangenomic study, we determined that among the
HSP protein members, only the transcript encoding the
Small Heath Shock Protein B8 (HSPB8, HSP22, H11,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

E2IG1) was overexpressed in R6 cells compared to their
parental counterpart. Of note, gain and loss of function
experiments demonstrated that HSPB8 is a key factor for
velcade resistance in our cell line model. In association
with BAG3 and HSP70, the chaperone activity of HSPB8
was reported to be involved in the delivery of misfolded
proteins to the macroautophagy machinery [26, 27].
Thus, the function of HSPB8 in velcade-resistant cells
is in agreement with the increased autophagy flux and
the exacerbated capacity to remove aggregates observed
in R6 cells. Induction of BAG3, HSP70 and HSPB8 at
both the RNA and protein levels was reported under
stress conditions including proteasome inhibition [43,
44] . In our model, we observed an induction of BAG3
and HSP70 protein levels in both U266 parental and R6
cells upon velcade treatment. HSPB8 protein induction
was only observed in R6 clone treated with velcade (data
not shown) reinforcing the importance of HSPB8 in the
process of resistance to velcade.
HSPB8 gene alteration and mutations have
been reported in neurological disease. In this context,
inactivating HSPB8 mutations (K141E, K141N) were
described to cause distal motor neuropathy [45]. In
contrast, overexpresion of HSPB8 was reported to
prevent the aggregation of Htt43Q, a pathogenic form
of Huntingtin responsible for Hungtington’s disease
[46]. HSPB8 was also shown to promote autophagic
removal of misfolded proteins involved in amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) [47]. Accumulation of aggresomes
represents a novel mechanism by which to induce
apoptosis, especially among cells where protein
production and catabolism are critically important for
malignant cell survival, as it is the case for malignant
and normal immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells [37,
48]. Thus, it is likely that in MM, HSPB8 up-regulation
occurs as a plausible strategy for malignant plasmocytes
to counteract the cytotoxic effect of velcade. The HSPB8
protein level in patients suffering MM responding or
relapsing to velcade treatment remains to be measured to
verify this hypothesis.
In conclusion, the results presented herein suggest
that overexpression of HSPB8 in myeloma cells could play
an important role for the elimination of cell aggregates in
velcade-resistant cells that therefore contributes to their
enhanced survival.

the cells were collected and incubated with PI (10 µg/
ml) for 5 min. The percentage of PI positive cells was
next analysed by flow cytometry using MACSQUANT
Analyser (Myltenyi Biotech, 130-092).

Protein aggregates
Measurement of protein aggregates was performed
using the ProteoStat Aggresome Dectection Kit (ENZ51035-K100) from ENZO Life Sciences according to the
manufacturer procedure. Briefly, after stimulation, cells
were collected, washed with PBS and centrifugated (400

min at RT. Then, the cells were centrifugated (800 ×g for
10 min), washed in PBS, and permeabilized (0.5 % Triton
X-100, 3 mM EDTA, pH 8) for 30 min on ice. The cells
were centrifugated again (800xg for 10 min), washed in
PBS and incubated with the ProteoStat Aggresome Red
Detection Reagent for 30 min at RT. Protein aggregates
were measured by flow cytometry in the FL3 channel.
