Abstract
Myoferlin is a member of the ferlin family of proteins that participate in plasma membrane fusion, repair,
and endocytosis. While some reports have implicated myoferlin in cancer, the extent of its expression in and
contributions to cancer are not well established. In this study, we show that myoferlin is overexpressed in
human breast cancers and that it has a critical role in controlling degradation of the epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor (EGFR) after its activation and internalization in breast cancer cells. Myoferlin depletion
blocked EGF-induced cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Both effects were induced as a
result of impaired degradation of phosphorylated EGFR via dysfunctional plasma membrane caveolae and
alteration of caveolin homo-oligomerization. In parallel, myoferlin depletion reduced tumor development in a
chicken chorioallantoic membrane xenograft model of human breast cancer. Considering the therapeutic
signiﬁcance of EGFR targeting, our ﬁndings identify myoferlin as a novel candidate function to target for
future drug development. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5438–48. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) whose activation and signaling contributes to major cancer key hallmarks including proliferation,
invasion, and metastasis (1). As such, EGFR and its downstream
signaling is currently one of the most explored pathways in
terms of targeting and anticancer treatments. Unfortunately,
current therapies aiming to interfere with EGFR signaling
components are rather disappointing in clinics, reﬂecting our
limited mechanistic understanding. Today, a wealth of evidence suggests that an essential aspect of EGFR activity
regulation consists of receptor internalization (endocytosis)
and intracellular targeting (2). This process goes beyond simple
recycling of the EGFR and attenuation of the signaling. In fact, it
provides an important spatial and temporal component to the
activity of the receptor. Endosomes containing EGFR (or other

activated RTK), depending of their composition, can either
continue to signal in a speciﬁc cell compartment or be rapidly
degraded in other. At least 2 mechanisms of RTK internalization, respectively, identiﬁed as clathrin (CME) or nonclathrin
(NCE)–mediated endocytosis, have been described to play
essential roles in deﬁning EGFR fate upon ligand-based activation (2, 3). The activation of one particular endocytic pathway
depends at least in part on EGF concentration (3), and each of
the two leads to a different outcome for the receptor (e.g.,
degradation or recycling). The NCE process is particularly
blurry with yet many unknown players that participate/regulate it. Present literature frequently points at caveolin as a
protein that is involved in the NCE; however, the presence of
this protein is not always a compulsory factor (2, 3). This leaves
an important question open concerning the identity of proteins
participating in NCE. Along these lines, another protein, myoferlin, has been found to colocalize with caveolin and dynamin2, together being involved in the process of receptor-dependent
endocytosis in endothelial cells (4). Although, in normal cells,
myoferlin has been described important for cell membrane
fusion, repair, and recycling (5–9), this protein has received no
attention in the context of RTK internalization in cancer.
Myoferlin is a member of the ferlin family of proteins (including dysferlin and otoferlin as well as 3 additional yet not
characterized members FER1L4, FER1L5, and FER1L6) implicated in muscular development (5). Biochemically, myoferlin
consists of multiple C2 domains, which are known to have
specialized segments interacting with phospholipids and proteins. In addition, myoferlin has a transmembrane (single
pass) and short extracellular domain. In endothelial cells,
myoferlin was found to regulate vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) biologic activity through preventing

Myoferlin Controls EGFR Function

its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (10). In the
same cells, myoferlin silencing decreased the expression of
angiopoietin-1 receptor (TIE2), another RTK expressed mainly
in the vascular endothelium (11). In normal myoblasts, Demonbreun and colleagues showed that myoferlin deﬁciency leads to
a defect in insulin growth factor-like receptor (IGFR1) trafﬁcking as well as to decreased IGFR1 signaling (12). Although
increasing number of studies continue to further our understanding of myoferlin function in normal cells, to date, only little
(13–15) is known concerning its role in tumor cells. Three
previous studies have reported the overexpression of myoferlin
at the mRNA level in lung (16) and breast cancer (17) as well as at
the protein level in pancreas cancer (18). Our attention has been
drawn to this protein owing to the present proteomic study of
accessible extracellular and cell membrane proteins in breast
cancer tissues, where myoferlin was found as overexpressed in
breast cancer cells and absent in normal epithelial cells. This
original observation has encouraged us to investigate
the possibility that myoferlin overexpression in breast cancer
modulates the activity of EGFR. Indeed, we found that myoferlin
colocalized with caveolin to control the cellular destiny of
activated EGFR. In absence of myoferlin, activated EGFR cannot
be degraded in breast cancer cells and hence continues to
activate the downstream components of the EGFR pathway,
leading to prolonged/aberrant signaling, notably resulting primarily in the inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and migration in breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Patients
All experiments undertaken with patient material complied
with the regulations and ethical guidelines of the University of
Liege (Liege, Belgium). All tissue samples were obtained from
the Pathology Department of the University Hospital of Liege.
The proteomics analysis was conducted using 3 tumoral
(ductal adenocarcinoma) and adjacent normal tissue samples,
collected from 3 patients. The patients were female, 61 to 78
years of age, and with tumor grade 2 to 3 (Bloome grading). The
immunohistochemical (IHC) validation was conducted on a
collection of breast cancer tissues comprising 90 tumoral
(patients with breast ductal adenocarcinoma, grade 2 and 3
with no known metastases at the time point of surgery) and 10
normal adjacent tissues. The Western blot-based validation
was conducted on samples originating from 4 patients with
breast ductal and 4 with lobular carcinoma (not included in the
mass spectrometry or IHC analysis) as well as their matched
normal tissues.
Proteomic analysis
The analytic approach has been developed and described
previously (19). Brieﬂy, fresh human breast cancer biopsies
were immediately sliced and soaked in freshly prepared EZ-link
Sulfo NHS-SS biotin (1 mg/mL, Pierce) solution. Following 20minute incubation at 37 C, the samples were snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and converted to powder. Protein extraction
was conducted as previously described (19). The protein
extracts were mixed with 100 mL/mg streptavidin resin (Pierce)

www.aacrjournals.org

and incubated for 2 hours under rotational conditions at room
temperature. The supernatant was retained for the subsequent
glycoproteomic analysis (fraction 1) and the streptavidin beads
were washed thoroughly. The biotinylated proteins were eluted
(fraction 2) using 100 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT; 30 minutes
at 60 C). Fraction 1 was also reduced in 100 mmol/L DTT.
Following this, both fractions were alkylated with 150 mmol/L
iodoacetamide (30 minutes at room temperature) and the
proteins were then precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid
at 4 C overnight. Subsequently, the proteins were dissolved (as
complete as possible) in 50 mmol/L NH4HCO3 and digested
using trypsin (Promega; 1:50 protease/protein ratio at 37 C)
overnight. The biotinylated peptides (fraction 2) were further
processed using mass spectrometry. Fraction 1 was used for
the isolation of glycopeptides. For mass spectrometry and data
processing analysis, refer to Supplementary Section.
MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 cell culture, and siRNAmediated knockdown
The MDA-MB231 (HTB-26) and MDA-MB468 (HTB-132)
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
The cells were authenticated through DNA proﬁling of 8
different and highly polymorphic short-tandem repeat loci
(DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Both cell lines were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(MP Biomedicals) and L-Glutamine (MP Biomedicals) at 37 C,
5% CO2, and 95% humidity. The cells were used between
passages 5 and 20 reaching near-conﬂuence and were harvested with trypsin. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, catalog no. 11668-019, Life
Technologies) with small-interfering RNA (Thermo Scientiﬁc)
directed against myoferlin (siRNA#1: CCCUGUCUGGAAUGAGA and siRNA#2: CGGCGGAUGCUGUCAAAUA) or caveolin
(CGAGAAGCAAGUGUACGAC) at a concentration of 10 nmol/
L/siRNA. ON-TARGETplus Non-Targeting Pool (Dharmacon)
was used as a negative control [further referred to as Irrelevant
(Irr.) siRNA]. The principal effects (migration, invasion, and
EGF stimulation experiments) were evaluated using both myoferlin siRNA oligomers. As both displayed similar levels of
silencing, the remaining experiments were conducted using
siRNA #1. Sixteen hours after transfection, culture medium was
changed and 48 hours later, the cells were lysed and used for all
Western blot analyses. For ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), cells were detached with 5 mmol/L EDTA.
EGF stimulation
Cells, 32 hours –after transfection, were starved overnight
(16 hours) in serum-free DMEM and stimulated with a pulse of
10 ng/mL of EGF (PeProTech) for different periods of time (up
to 120 minutes). Cells were then washed once with PBS and
subsequently subjected to protein extraction as described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods (under the section
Western blot).
Immunoﬂuorescence
After 16 hours of siRNA-mediated silencing, 5.0  104 cells
were plated in on a 12 mm coverslip (Menzer Glaser;

CB00120RA1) and allowed to grow for additional 36 hours.
The cells were then starved overnight in medium without
serum and then treated with 10 ng/mL EGF and allowed to
incubate for a maximum of 120 minutes. Treated cells were
ﬁxed for 10 minutes at 20 C in a methanol/acetone solution (80/20), washed twice with PBS, and blocked in 2%
bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, A3059) for 30
minutes. Coverslips were incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature with primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA:
anti-caveolin (same as for Western blot, see Supplemental
Supplementary Data), anti-myoferlin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-51367), anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
sc-03), and anti-pEGFR (Millipore; 05-1004). Subsequently,
the slides were washed in 3 PBS–BSA washes and incubated
with dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies; A-11056, A-11029, and A-21070) for 45 minutes at room
temperature. Following 3 additional washes, nuclei were
labeled with 2 ng/mL Hoechst (Merck) for 5 minutes and
the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Sigma) on glass
slides. Images were accrued with laser scanning confocal
microscope (A1R, Nikon Instruments).
EGF-mediated EMT assay
MDA-MB468 cells served as an EGF-inducible EMT model
and were described in detail elsewhere (20). Brieﬂy, 48 h posttransfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated at a conﬂuence of 200,000/well in a 6-well plate. The culture medium
was supplemented with EGF for a ﬁnal concentration of 20 ng/
mL. Cells were allowed to grow for further 24 to 48 hours
following protein and RNA extraction.
Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (in vivo) tumor
assay
On embryonic day 11, 100 mL of a suspension of 2  106
of MDA-MB231 cells in culture medium mixed (1:1) with
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were deposited in the center of
a plastic ring on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
Tumors were harvested on embryonic day 18 and were
either ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (30 minutes)
for histology analysis or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for
Western blot analysis. Tumor volume was assessed using the
formula V ¼ 43  p  ðH  L  W Þ3 where H, L, and W denote
height, length, and width of the tumor.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were carried out in biologic triplicates. The
CAM model was conducted in 3 biologic and 5 technical
replicates, where appropriate statistical analysis was conducted using 2-sided Student t test and assuming equal variances. The calculations were conducted with Excel software
(Microsoft).

The proteomic approach used here on 3 human breast
cancer samples enriches for extracellular and membrane-

bound proteins (19, 21). These proteins, which are considered
as potentially accessible, are particularly relevant for therapeutic targeting and imaging applications (22). Comparative
mass spectrometry analysis (cancer vs. normal adjacent tissue)
identiﬁed more than 1,400 proteins, of which approximately
800 were already known to be cell membrane-bound or extracellular. The semiquantitative evaluation identiﬁed a number
of modulated proteins outlined in Supplementary Table S1.
The number of identiﬁed peptides, Mascot score, and sequence
coverage for each of the modulated proteins is outlined in
Supplementary Table S2. A number of proteins were identiﬁed
owing to the glycopeptide enrichment step of the proteomic
method used in this study. These are listed in the Supplementary Table S3 along with the glycosylated peptides and the sites
of glycosylation that led to their identiﬁcation.
Myoferlin was identiﬁed as a novel breast cancer-related
protein in all 3 patient samples used for the proteomic analysis.
Next, we sought to conﬁrm myoferlin expression in a larger
breast cancer patients' series. We conducted IHC analysis of
myoferlin expression in 90 breast adenocarcinoma samples
and in 10 adjacent normal breast tissues. The IHC analysis
(Fig. 1A) fully conﬁrmed the mass spectrometry data and
showed that myoferlin overexpression is a consistent feature
of breast cancer. The staining was speciﬁcally detected in
tumor cells, mostly conferred not only to the plasma membrane but also the cytoplasm. Normal adjacent breast ducts
were predominantly negative, with low/moderate positivity detectable mainly in endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). Further
Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) on paired samples (tumor and
adjacent normal tissue from same individual) of breast ductal
adenocarcinoma and lobular carcinoma conﬁrmed IHC
data. We then conducted a Western blot evaluation of myoferlin expression in a selection of normal human tissues.
Interestingly, myoferlin expression was not detectable in all
the normal tissues tested (Fig. 1C), except testis and skin.
Myoferlin silencing in breast cancer cells impaired EGFinduced migration and EMT
EGFR pathway signaling has pronounced cellular consequences in cancer leading to differentiation and alterations
of associated processes such as migration, invasion, and
EMT (23–25). Previous studies have shown that MDA-MB231
cells are responsive to EGF stimulus, characterized by
enhanced migration (25). We have examined whether
MDA-MB231 cells lacking myoferlin would still show responsiveness toward EGF (Fig. 2A), and found that myoferlindepleted cells are unable to migrate (Boyden chamber assay)
when pulsed with EGF. This impaired migration toward
EGF was also observable in myoferlin-depleted MDA-MB468
breast cancer cells (Supplementary Data and Supplementary
Fig. S2).
To further examine the consequence of myoferlin depletion on EGFR signaling and related biologic processes, we
used an EGF-inducible EMT breast cancer cell model. In
our recent work (20), we have shown that MDA-MB468
cells are able to undergo EMT in vitro following EGF stimulation. Unlike MDA-MB231 cells, which in basal conditions
are displaying a prominent mesenchymal appearance, the

MDA-MB468 cells are epithelial-like. In presence of the EGF
stimulus, MDA-MB468 cells undergo EMT, adopting a mesenchymal phenotype that is primarily characterized by a
strong induction of vimentin (VIM) expression coupled to
the downregulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) as well as by
modulation of other more speciﬁc EMT markers (further
detailed in ref. 20). In the present work, we used VIM and
CDH1 as surrogate markers of EGF-induced EMT in the
MDA-MB468 cells. Myoferlin depletion in MDA-MB468
cells signiﬁcantly impaired their capacity to undergo EGFinduced EMT with both reduced VIM induction and downregulation of CDH1 expression (Fig. 2B and C). These effects
were already noticeable 24 hours post-EGF treatment (VIM)
and became more pronounced at 48 hours (VIM and CDH1).
Myoferlin regulates EGFR fate upon EGF-mediated
receptor activation
Following ligand binding, EGFR undergoes phosphorylation,
internalization, and intracellular targeting to modulate downstream signaling. We have investigated whether myoferlin is

www.aacrjournals.org

involved in the EGFR signaling machinery. As shown in Fig. 3A,
upon EGF stimulation, depletion of myoferlin in MDA-MB231
cells led to sustained pEGFR activation, evidenced through
prominent phosphorylation of Y1173 residue (the same effect
was observed in MDA-MB468, Supplementary Fig. S2). Following this, we examined whether the downstream targets of the
EGFR signaling were also activated. One major key component
of the pathway is AKT (RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein
kinase), which is readily phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation. The results in Fig. 3B show that EGF stimulation of MDAMB231 cells induced the phosphorylation of AKT on S473 and
that this signaling pathway is enhanced and prolonged in
myoferlin-depleted cells.
As shown in the Fig. 3A, total EGFR expression levels were
increased in comparison with the mock-transfected cells.
Further gene expression analysis showed moderately elevated
levels of EGFR mRNA (1.5-fold in comparison with the siRNA
Irr. at 48 hours) evident in basal condition and further observed during EGF stimulation (data not shown). Although the
gene expression and protein synthesis levels are not directly

comparable, it is unlikely that this moderate increase in EGFR
mRNA can justify the prominent increase of protein levels. To
further explore this effect, we next veriﬁed whether the internalization process was affected. Quantitative measurement of
EGFR levels on the surface of living MDA-MB231 cells during
EGF stimulation revealed comparable internalization kinetics
between myoferlin-depleted and control conditions (Fig. 3C).
Further immunoﬂuorescence-based analysis showed that the
EGFR was internalized in myoferlin-depleted cells in the same
manner as in the control condition. However, after 60 and 120
minutes, the EGFR foci failed to resolve in the absence of
myoferlin (Fig. 3D). These observations suggest that the
elevated EGFR levels in myoferlin-depleted cells are probably
linked to their inability to properly degrade the receptor and
hence switch off the pEGFR signal. To test whether the
blocking of the EGFR degradation will show similar effect on
pEGFR levels as myoferlin silencing, we inhibited proteolytic
activity of the proteasome using MG132 while subjecting the
cells to the same EGF stimulation as shown in Fig. 3A. The
comparison of the resulting EGFR/pEGFR expression patterns (Supplementary Fig. S3) showed that impairment of
proteasome degradation caused a sustained EGFR expression
and activation, similar to what is observed when myoferlin
is silenced. Finally, we examined whether myoferlin is colocalizing with EGFR in basal conditions and in the presence of
EGF (Fig. 3E). The data show that EGFR does colocalize with

myoferlin in MDA-MB231 cells, both in basal and EGF conditions. As displayed in the Fig. 3E, myoferlin and EGFR are
also detectable and colocalized in the endosomic vesicles,
structures typically observed following EGF-induced EGFR
endocytosis. Considering the existence of 2 EGFR internalization mechanisms (CME and NCE), we next veriﬁed whether
clathrin or/and caveolin are affected following myoferlin
silencing in MDA-MB231 cells.
Myoferlin does not affect clathrin cellular distribution/
quantity in MDA-MB231 cells
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis showed that myoferlin colocalizes with clathrin in breast cancer cells both in serum and
EGF-rich conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6A). As expected,
clathrin showed evidence of colocalization with pEGFR during
EGF-stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S6B). However, myoferlin depletion neither induced any marked modiﬁcation of
clathrin distribution in the cell (Supplementary Fig. S6B)
nor a change in clathrin total protein levels (Supplementary
Fig. S6C).
Myoferlin is critical for proper assembly of caveolin in
caveolae
Previous studies reported the existence of an intimate
relationship between caveolin (and particularly the caveolae) and myoferlin in the context of endocytosis (9). In

accordance with literature, we found that myoferlin was
colocalized with caveolin both in control (basal condition)
as well as in EGF-treated cells along the treatment time
course (Fig. 4A). Further immunoﬂuorescence analysis of
pEGFR and caveolin in EGF-stimulated MDA-MB231 cells
(Fig. 4B) showed evidence of colocalization of both proteins
in mock-transfected cells, both in basal and EGF-stimulated
conditions. In myoferlin-depleted cells, the colocalization
was weaker and at latter time points (60 and 120 minutes)
pEGFR and caveolin did not colocalize. We also observed
that caveolin foci in myoferlin-depleted cells were larger and
more variable in size, which is particularly visible at later
time points following EGF stimulation (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
myoferlin silencing in nonstimulated MDA-MB231 cells
resulted in a higher concentration of caveolin homo-oligomers (Fig. 5B, left), the presence of major aberrant molecular
weight forms (in comparison with the control condition),
and an enhanced enrichment of caveolin in lipid-raft microdomains (Fig. 5B, right). The latter pool of caveolin was not
found in the same fractions where myoferlin was present.
The appearance of caveolin homo-oligomers with aberrant
molecular weight was particularly emphasized after EGF
stimulation in myoferlin-depleted cells (Fig. 5C). The present
data suggest that the interaction between myoferlin and
caveolin is essential for proper organization of caveole and
endocytosis of pEGFR. This is further supported by the data
shown in Fig. 5D, where siRNA-mediated depletion of caveo-

lin in MDA-MB231 cells, similar to myoferlin silencing,
induced an accumulation of pEGFR. In contrast, caveolin
depletion was unable to inhibit the degradation of the EGFR
upon EGF stimulation. Phospho-EGFR levels, although initially elevated, returned to basal levels at later stage.
Myoferlin affects migration, invasion, and survival of
tumor cells and is essential for tumor growth in vivo
In vitro studies in basal conditions (medium with serum)
show that myoferlin depletion induces reduction in cell migration (50%) and invasion (60%) but does not affect cell
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). In addition,
myoferlin depletion leads to a modest reduction of cell growth
in vitro (10%–20%; Supplementary Fig. S1D). Keeping in mind
that tumors are rich in growth factors (e.g., EGF), we next
sought to understand whether EGF stimulation of myoferlindepleted MDA-MB231 cells might further potentiate the cell
death. Assaying for apoptosis showed that myoferlin-depleted
MDA-MB231 cells show up to a 3-fold increase of cell death
following EGF stimulation (Fig. 6B). Starting from the present
in vitro data, we next sought to determine whether the loss of
myoferlin in breast cancer cells had an impact on tumor
growth in vivo. We implanted MDA-MB231 cells onto the
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryos and
evaluated the tumor development when myoferlin was depleted (Fig. 6C). As shown in the Fig. 6A, siRNA-mediated myoferlin
depletion is highly effective, lasting for the entire time period of

tumor growth in the present model. On day 7 postimplantation, tumor volumes were measured and showed that myoferlin depletion halved the tumor volume (reduction by 40%)
within this short time period (Fig. 6C). Histologic analysis of
myoferlin-depleted tumors showed general decrease of cellularity characterized by loosely associated cells, lacking orientation typically observed in tissue structures (Fig. 6D). IHC
staining of EGFR expression in mock-transfected and myoferlin-depleted tumors showed a stronger EGFR immunostaining
in myoferlin-depleted tumor cells. The EGFR staining pattern
was predominantly homogeneous in mock-transfected tumor
cells, whereas myoferlin-depleted cells often displayed higher
accumulation of EGFR, similar to the one observed in vitro
post-EGF stimulation (Fig. 3D).

Discussion
EGFR is one of the receptors most commonly associated
with human tumors. Ligand binding and dimerization causes
autophosphorylation of the intracytoplasmic domains and
activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase. Activated EGFR
(pEGFR) stimulates a number of different signal transduction
pathways, which play important roles in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation and migration. Our study
shows for the ﬁrst time that myoferlin is overexpressed at the
protein level in all human breast adenocarcinomas analyzed
and that myoferlin knockdown in breast cancer cells interferes
with EGF-induced cell migration and EMT. Moreover, our

5444

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

data designate an unexpected link between myoferlin and
EGFR in breast cancer cells, where myoferlin intervenes in
the control of EGFR activity and signaling. Consistent with
the previous report of Bernatchez and colleagues (9) in endothelial cells, we show that myoferlin colocalizes with caveolin
in breast cancer cells, both in basal condition and upon EGF
stimulation. As the major component of membrane caveolae,
caveolin interacts with a variety of partners such as integrins
and RTK receptors and functions as a regulatory platform for
their respective postligand signaling (26). Because of the
frequent deletion of caveolin gene in cancers, including breast
cancer, caveolin has been considered as a potential tumor
suppressor (27). Caveolin scaffolding has been previously
shown to induce EGFR sequestration in tumor cells. In particular, Lajoie and colleagues (28) propose that the sensitivity
of cancer cells to EGF stimulus can be controlled by 2 membrane domains: on one hand, caveolin that concentrates
EGFR and blocks it from signaling and on the other hand, the
galectin lattice that holds EGFR at the membrane and favors its
mitogenic signaling. Despite the prevailing evidence that
caveolin acts as a tumor suppressor, it is noteworthy that its
overexpression has been also associated with the metastatic
potential of lung and prostate cancer cells (29–31). This study
provides an answer to these apparently contradictory ﬁndings
by pointing for the ﬁrst time to myoferlin as an important
regulator of caveolin scaffold in breast cancer cells. We show
that myoferlin suppression results in enhanced clustering of

caveolin oligomers in lipid-raft microdomains as well as the
emergence of smaller oligomers of aberrant size. Our data
notably show that myoferlin (but not caveolin) depletion is
sufﬁcient to block EGFR degradation and to stop the attenuation of EGFR phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. We
found that in breast cancer cells myoferlin depletion does not
affect EGFR endocytosis rate, suggesting that this protein is
dispensable at this early step. As the internalization proceeds,
the cargo (in this case EGFR) needs to be targeted in the cell for
activating downstream effectors and subsequently to be neutralized via proteasomal and lysosomal degradation (2). Previous studies suggest that proteasomal degradation precedes
and is necessary for the lysosomal targeting of the receptor
(32–34). A recent multiparametric image analysis study reveals
a predominant role of caveolin in endosomal progression
rather than internalization of EGFR (35). Altogether, these
observations suggest that myoferlin depletion favors caveolin
oligomers scaffold formation, which sequesters EGFR and
interferes with the normal ligand-induced degradation of
EGFR. We note that this mechanistic scenario applies to EGFR
in breast cancer cells and that in other cell types myoferlin
may differently regulate the fate of other RTKs, as previously
shown with VEGFR2 in endothelial cells (10).
Our results indicate that permanent phosphorylation of
EGFR in cells lacking myoferlin has detrimental effects on
the EGFR-controlled biologic processes. We believe that the

www.aacrjournals.org

length of signaling has an impact on which cellular processes
are activated downstream. Same is the case with Raf kinase
(36), where high-intensity Raf signal causes cell-cycle arrest;
this is in contrast to the normally assumed proproliferation
function. Recently, Rush and colleagues (37) have shown that
high endosomal accumulation of activated EGFR induces
apoptosis in MDA-MB468 cells. The authors have used
monensin to block endosomal trafﬁcking of EGFR. As EGFR
accumulation and activation pattern shown in the current
study largely exceeds the magnitude of EGFR accumulation
shown previously (37), it is reasonable to propose that cell
death is probably the terminal outcome of myoferlin depletion. The present results conﬁrm this and show a strong
induction of apoptosis in myoferlin deﬁcient, EGF-stimulated cells. This could be the key factor for explaining the
signiﬁcant reduction in size of myoferlin-depleted MDAMB231 tumors in vivo. One of the most striking biologic
effects observed here was the inability of breast cancer
cells to respond to EGF-stimulus to migrate (MDA-MB231
and MDA-MB468) or undergo EMT (MDA-MB468). Li and
colleagues (14) reported recently that MDA-MB231 underwent a spontaneous reverse EMT in the absence of myoferlin. However, similar data published by the same authors
elsewhere (38) partially dispute their recently published
results (e.g., vimentin levels after myoferlin depletion; ref.
14). We were unable to observe similar effects in MDA-

MB231 cells as shown in ref. 14; neither cell attachment
nor vimentin levels are affected upon myoferlin silencing
(detailed in Supplementary Data, Fig. S5). Interestingly, Li
and colleagues (14) and Eisenberg and colleagues (13) both
showed that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated myoferlin
depletion impairs MDA-MB231 cells' invasion; however, it
has no effect on cell migration or proliferation. Our invasion
and proliferation data are in agreement with the literature
(13, 14). However, opposite to the previous ﬁndings (13, 14),
we show that myoferlin silencing exhibits a strong inhibitory
effect on the ability of MDA-MB231 cells to migrate.
Although unable at this stage to explain for these discrepancies, we think that experimental differences and adaptation processes when using shRNAs (13, 14) in contrast with
siRNAs (present study) might play an important role. First,
previous studies (13, 14) did not use any coating of Transwell
inserts when conducting migration experiments; we have
used denatured protein matrix coating (gelatin) to provide
environment for the cells to attach and subsequently
migrate through the insert. Second, adaptation processes
may arise with stable transfected cell lines, which in turn
may mask the true phenotype (39, 40). Concomitantly with
our research, Leung and colleagues (15) have reported
on myoferlin function in mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells
(mLLC). In accordance with our in vivo data, the authors
have showed that myoferlin has a strong impact on tumor
growth in vivo. The authors have assessed both cell prolif-

5446

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

eration and apoptosis (in vitro and in vivo) and found that
myoferlin silencing impacted mainly proliferation and not
apoptosis in mLLC cells. These interesting data in a murine
system strengthen the role of myoferlin as an oncogene
protein but also indicate that myoferlin may assume similar
yet distinct roles in tumors of different types. In conclusion,
our data show that myoferlin is overexpressed in a large
cohort of human breast cancer and that silencing of myoferlin impedes breast cancer cells to respond to EGF-mediated protumoral stimulus. The latter occurs at least in part
owing to the aberrant caveolin oligomerization.
