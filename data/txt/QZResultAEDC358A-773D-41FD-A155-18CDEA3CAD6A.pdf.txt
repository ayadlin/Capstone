Abstract
OBJECTIVES: This review stated the possible application of the active components
of licorice, glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
treatment based on the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/thromboxane A2 (TxA2) pathway.
METHODS: The extensive literature from inception to July 2015 was searched
in PubMed central, and relevant reports were identified according to the purpose of
this study.
RESULTS: The active components of licorice GL and GA exert the potential antiinflammatory effects through, at least in part, suppressing COX-2 and its downstream
product TxA2. Additionally, the COX-2/TxA2 pathway, an auto-regulatory feedback
loop, has been recently found to be a crucial mechanism underlying the pathogenesis
of RA. However, TxA2 is neither the pharmacological target of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) nor the target of disease modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs (DMARDs), and the limitations and side effects of those drugs may be, at least
in part, attributable to lack of the effects on the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. Therefore, GL
and GA capable of targeting this pathway hold the potential as a novel add-on therapy
in therapeutic strategy, which is supported by several bench experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: The active components of licorice, GL and GA, could not only
potentiate the therapeutic effects but also decrease the adverse effects of NSAIDs
or DMARDs through suppressing the COX-2/TxA2 pathway during treatment course
of RA.

Introduction

medicinal plant [3]. The principle component of licorice is
Glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhizin (GL), which is a natural
and major pentacyclic triterpenoid glycoside of licorice
roots extracts [4] (Figure 1). GL is readily hydrolyzed to
glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) in human body [5]. Following
oral administration in humans as well as in rats, GL is
metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract by glucuronidases
into GA, which can be totally absorbed [6].
Licorice remains one of the most prescribed herbs
in Chinese Medicine. There is much literature on the
biological effects of the major bioactive components of
licorice, particularly in terms of their anti-cancer, antiinflammatory and anti-arthritic effects [1, 5, 7]. For

Because of the unwanted side effects of current
drugs used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment,
botanical medicines have become popular as alternative
remedies as they are believed to be efficacious, safe and
have over a thousand years’ experience in treating patients
[1]. In addition, analysis of patents on anti-RA therapies
issued in China revealed that traditional Chinese Medicine
may provide substantial new information for anti-RA
drugs development [2]. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)
is a well-known plant, which is utilized to add flavor to
foods, beverages, and tobacco, and it is also used as a

example, licorice and the roasted licorice have benefits
in protecting against both acute inflammation and chronic
inflammatory conditions including RA [7].
It is well known that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
is an important target of licorice, as many constituents
of licorice are able to suppress COX-2 [1, 8, 9], which
is critically involved in the pathogenesis of tumor and
inflammatory diseases like RA [10-13]. Five years ago,
Prof. Paul M. Stewart and Stephen M. Prescott raised
a question, that is, can licorice lick colon cancer?[14].
This question is raised from a discovery showing that GL
reduced COX-2 activity, tumor growth, and metastasis,
without the adverse effects associated with non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective COX-

2 inhibitors (COXIBs) [15]. Today, using the same
sentence pattern, we are asking the question “can active
components of licorice GL and GA lick RA?” This is a
data-based question, raised from several lines of evidence
showing as followings. First, GL and GA provide an antiinflammatory effect by suppressing the expression and
activity of COX-2 through the inhibition of nuclear factor
(NF)-κB and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activity
[16]. Second, there are some common targets and common
therapies have been revealed between RA and cancers,
such as cadherin-11 and COX-2 [11, 17]. Third, COX-2
is crucially implicated in RA pathogenesis, and NSAIDs
as well as COXIBs are frequently used in treating patients
with RA [18]. Therefore, can active components of licorice

The COX-2/TxA2 pathway is a
pharmacological target of GL
and GA

GL and GA lick RA? In this review, we will clarify this
possibility based on the COX-2/thromboxane A2 (TxA2)
pathway, which is a mechanism novelly delineated in the
pathogenesis of RA [11, 19].

It is well known that COX-2 is an inducible
enzyme becoming abundant in inflammatory diseases
including RA [11, 20]. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion
of arachidonic acid (AA) into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2).
PGH2 is unstable and it is catalyzed by prostaglandin
E synthase (PGES), prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) and
thromboxane synthase (TxAS) into prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI) and TXA2, respectively [21,
22] (Figure 2). The role of PGES/PGE2 is to some extent
controversial, as PGE2 has both pro-inflammatory and
immunosuppression effects depending on cell context
[22]. PGIS is generally considered to have cytoprotection
effects, and the imbalance of PGI/TxA2 in favor of
the latter is one of critical mechanisms underlying
pathogenesis of cancer, inflammatory disease and vascular
disorders [21, 22] (Figure 2). As a downstream product of
COX-2 in inflammatory sites, TxA2 is a local hormone
acting close to the site of its synthesis via autocrine or

Methods
We searched the PubMed database from
inception to July 2015 with the following search terms:
“licorice”, “glycyrrhiza glabra”, “glycyrrhizic acid”,
“glycyrrhizin”, “glycyrrhetinic acid”, “thromboxane”,
“cyclooxygenase-2”, and/or “rheumatoid arthritis”.
The references within the selected reports were also
considered. No limitations on language and study types.
Relevant literature focusing on the field of licorice and
its active components, as well as RA was identified.
Three independent investigators conducted the searching
process, and the experts in the field of Rheumatology were
involved in the procedure of literature analysis.

Figure 2: The COX/TxA2 pathway is the pharmacological target of glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA).
Among downstream products of COX-2 pathway, PGI is generally considered to have cytoprotection effects, and the imbalance of PGI/
TxA2 in favor of the latter is one of critical mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of cancer, inflammatory disease and vascular disorders.
The role of PGES/PGE2 is to some extent controversial, as PGE2 has both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppression effects depending
on cell context. TxA2 acts through binding with TxA2 receptor (TP), thereby exerting promoting effects for tumor growth, inflammation
and angiogenesis. Licorice and its active components GL and GA are considered to hold anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties
through targeting the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. For example, GA inhibits lung tumor growth through suppressing expression and activity
of COX-2 and TxAS and the downstream ERK/CREB signaling (Ref.5). Abbreviations: COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; PGH2, prostaglandin

in the pathogenesis of RA

paracrine manner [19, 21, 22]. TxA2 functions through
binding with its signature receptor (Figure 2), TxA2
receptor (TP), which is a member of the G-protein-coupled
cell surface receptor family [11, 22, 23]. Importantly, it
is now clear that the COX-2/TxA2 pathway is an autoregulatory feedback loop for biosynthesis and action of
TxA2 and it plays a key role in the pathogenesis of RA
[11, 19].
Early studies documented that as the active
component of licorice, GL is an inhibitor of COXs, thereby
having anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects [24, 25].
Subsequently, GL was shown to have protective effects on
acute liver injury via downregulation of proinflammatory
mediators including COX-2 [26]. Further study showed
that GL potently protected against LPS-induced acute
lung injury through, at least in part, the suppression of
COX-2 [27]. These studies suggest that GL provides antiinflammatory effects with low toxicity or cytoprotective
property. Several studies revealed that GL is an inhibitor
of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) [28], which
is known to induce inflammation by enhancement of
proinflammatory molecules signaling including COX-2
pathway [29]. Intriguingly, HMGB1 is expected to be a
new target for RA treatment [30]. In Wister rats model
of 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)-induced liver toxicity,
pretreatment with GA showed potential hepatoprotective
effects, which are partly attributable to the attenuation
of COX-2 and its transcriptional factor NF-κB [31]. In
human endothelial cells, the effects of TP agonist I-BOP
could be mimicked by 1μM of GA with a similar time
course and efficacy [32], suggesting that GA may exert
its biological effects through acting on TxA2 pathway. In
our laboratory, it has been found that anti-tumor effect of
GL is, at least in part, TxAS-dependent [4]. Additionally,
we have elucidated that, through inhibiting TxAS and
its initiated extracellular signal-regulated kinas (ERK)
/ cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
signaling, GA suppresses lung tumor cell proliferation
[5]. It should be noted that the activities of several key
molecules COX-2, TxAS and NF-κB were inhibited
by GA, the whole effects of COX-2/TXA2 pathway is
therefore suppressed by GA. Although GA may function
as a TP agonist in some models, theoretically, its effects
cannot be mediated through the downstream signalings,
as ERK/CREB and NF-κB activities can be significantly
inhibited by GA.
Altogether, these observations have revealed that
the COX-2/TxA2 pathway is a pharmacological target of
GL/GA, which provides new insights into the mechanisms
of action of licorice. It also provides an explanation for
the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects of GL and
GA, as the COX-2/TxA2 pathway is well-known to be the
important molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis
of tumor and RA [11, 19, 20, 33, 34].

It is well known that TxA2 is one of the downstream
products of COX-2, and COX-2 as well as TxA2 are
overexpressed in inflammatory conditions like RA [11,
19]. In early studies, the higher TxA2 levels were found
in synovial lining obtained from RA patients, as compared
to specimens from non-RA patients [35-37]. Moreover,
TxA2 release was increased in peripheral blood leucocytes
when cultured with RA synovial fluid exudates [38, 39].
Recently, a study recruited 54 RA patients as well as 20
healthy subjects and found that the biosynthesis of TxA2
in RA patients was significantly higher than healthy
controls [40], which is in agreement with our recent
report for the first time showing that serum level of TxA2
is positively correlated with 28-joint disease activity
(DAS28) score of patients with RA [19]. Additionally, we
also found that in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLS), COX-2 effects can be mainly mediated by TxA2,
and the mRNA expression of COX-2 is regulated by
TxA2 action [11]. This study suggests a positive feedback
for TxA2 synthesis and action in RA synovial tissue.
Interestingly, it is now clear that in tumor cells, TxA2
contributes to cell proliferation through an auto-regulatory
feedback loop, in which NF-κB and its downstream COX2 are involved [20]. Therefore, enlightened by these
findings, we recently determined this pathway in in-vitro
model of RA. The results confirmed the existence of an
auto-regulatory feedback loop for TxA2 in RA FLS [19].
Through this auto-regulatory feedback loop, transcription
factor NF-κB is activated by TxA2 signaling, COX-2
and other inflammatory factors like TNF-α and IL-1 are
increased thereafter, thereby contributing to inflammation
in RA [19] (Figure 3).
Collectively, these observations suggest that the
pharmacological approaches targeting the COX-2/TxA2
pathway hold the potential as a novel add-on therapy in
the treatments of RA.

Adverse effects of RA treatment
drugs are related to the COX-2/
TxA2 pathway
Conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs (cDMARDs) are the first-line medications used
for RA treatment [41], while cDMARDs are more or
less ineffective in the late phase of RA and the unwanted
side effects often limit their use [42]. For example, both
methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF) are most
frequently prescribed cDMARDs, while use of these
two drugs entails a risk of cytopenias and the toxicity of
liver and renal [41, 43]. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) generally carry a definite
increased infection and cancer risks [41, 44, 45].

It is now clear that, in patients with RA, TxA2 is
not the molecular target of DMARDs [19]. The limitations
and side effects of these drugs are considered to be, at
least in part, due to lack of the effects on the biosynthesis
of COX-2-derived TxA2 [11]. In support of this view, it
is found that treatment of RA patients with anti-TNF-α
agents, belonging to bDMARDs, may blunt isoprostane
generation in the absence of significant effects on TxA2
biosynthesis, which could be associated with a higher
frequency of non-melanoma skin cancer in patients longterm treated with anti-TNF-α agents [11, 40]. In addition,
MTX is found not to suppress TxA2 biosynthesis in whole
blood from RA patients although MTX is a preferential
COX-2 inhibitor [46]. Interesting, the combined usage
of MTX and aspirin (selective TxA2 inhibitor) results
in antagonism of the cytotoxic effects of MTX [47].
Therefore, these observations suggest that suppressing the
biosynthesis of TxA2 that largely derived from COX-2
in inflammatory sites may produce a strong antagonistic

effect to reduce the adverse effects of DMARDs.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
including COXIBs are routinely used for long-term
therapy of RA in clinical practice [48, 49]. However,
because of the action that inhibition of COX-2-derived
endothelial PGI2 without concomitant inhibition of
TxA2 [50-52], some adverse effects of COXIBs, such as
cardiovascular effects and renal effects are to some extent
unavoidable [53-59]. Hence, the inhibitors of targeting
COX-2-derived TxA2 can theoretically mitigate those
adverse effects, when administered in combination with
COX-2 inhibitors.

GL and GA may be used as the
additive to RA treatment as they
suppress the COX-2/TxA2 pathway
Coupled with the observations showing the positive

Figure 3: The COX-2/TxA2 pathway is a crucial mechanism underlying the toxicity reducing and efficacy enhancing
effects of Glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) to NSAIDs/DMARDs. We have previously elucidated a positive

feedback loop for the biosynthesis and action of TxA2, i.e. the COX-2/TxA2 pathway (Ref.17). Briefly, in the inflammatory microenvironment
of RA joints, lymphocytes and inflammatory cells like macrophages and neutrophils are recruited and produce many pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 etc. By stimulation with these cytokines, the crucial molecules of COX-2 pathway, such
as PGE2 and TxA2, were produced by those inflammatory cells and RA FLS. Through autocrine or paracrine signaling, TxA2 is able
to specifically bind with its signature receptor TP, thereby activating several intracellular signals, MAPKs and PI3K/PKB pathways for
instance. The transcription factor CREB and NF-κB can be subsequently activated, and thus inducing the expression of COX-2, TxAS,
ACTN1, VEGF and other inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, a positive auto-regulatory feedback loop for the synthesis and action of TxA2
in inflammatory sites is formed and contributes to synovitis, a key role in pathogenesis of RA. It is thus suggested that the pharmacological
approaches targeting COX-2/TxA2 pathway hold the potential as a novel add-on therapy in the treatments of RA. Both NSAIDs (including
COXIBs) and DMARDs are typically prescribed medications for treatments of patients with RA. TxA2 is believed to be the non-target of
NSAIDs and DMARDs. Importantly, the limitations and adverse effects of those drugs may be, at least in part, due to lack of the effects
on the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. GL and GA are the major active components of licorice. Following oral administration in humans, GL is
metabolized into GA in the gastrointestinal tract and GA can be totally absorbed. Fortunately, GL and GA have been reported to target the
COX-2/TxA2 pathway. Therefore, GL or GA could be used as an adjunctive agent in RA treatments not only to enhance the therapeutic
effects of NSAIDs/DMARDs but also to reduce the adverse effects associated with NSAIDs/DMARDs. Abbreviations: TNF, tumor

role of COX-2/TxA2 pathway in pathogenesis of RA, as
stated above, the fact that TxA2 is not the molecular target
of DMARDs and NSAIDs/COXIBs suggest that drugs

targeting COX-2-derived TxA2 may reduce the negative
side effects during the RA treatment course. In support of
this conclusion, we have previously demonstrated that GL

patients, and the herbs used in traditional medicines
provide a rich reservoir for extracting biologically active
compounds. Licorice or the roasted licorice is one of the
oldest and most frequently used botanicals in traditional
Chinese medicine. This herb has been incorporated into
recipes not only to enhance taste, but also to treat various
conditions including inflammation [65]. GL and GA,
active components of licorice, have been reported to target
the COX-2/TxA2 pathway (Figure 3). Therefore, GL or
GA could be used as an adjunctive agent in RA treatment
not only to enhance the therapeutic effects of NSAIDs and
DMARDs but also to reduce the adverse effects associated
with NSAIDs and DMARDs (Figure 3). In a word, the
COX-2/TxA2 pathway could be a crucial mechanism
underlying the toxicity reducing and efficacy enhancing
effects of GL and GA on typically prescribed medications,
NSAIDs and DMARDs in principle, for treatments
of patients with RA (Figure 3). Many researches have
confirmed the toxicity reducing and efficacy enhancing
effects of GL and GA on RA treatment [60-62], while
further studies leading to the final application of this
finding in the clinical management of RA are urgently
required in the future.

and GA capable of inhibiting COX-2 expression and TxA2
biosynthesis could be used as an adjunctive agent in lung
tumor not only to enhance the chemotherapeutic effects of
cisplatin but also to reduce the adverse effects associated
with cisplatin [4, 5]. In a word, GL or GA can be used as
an additive to treatments of RA, as they are able to target
the COX-2/TxA2 pathway.
As a matter of fact, many evidences have already
documented that GL or GA can be used as an adjunctive
agent in treatments of RA. Triptolide, a major active
component of Tripterygium wilfordii, is used for treatment
in animal models of RA, whereas this natural component
possesses various pharmacological activities with narrow
therapeutic window and severe toxicities. In animal
model studies, toxicity of triptolide can be attenuated
with concomitant use of GL, as pretreatment with GL
significantly accelerates the metabolic elimination of
triptolide from the animal body [60]. Moreover, combined
triptolide and GL treatment (triptolide 13.40 μg, GL 26.78
mg) can reduce the arthritic index of collagen induced
arthritis (CIA) rats and decrease serum levels of TNF-α,
and such effect was similar to the one measured upon
application of triptolide 17.86 μg [61]. It is suggested that
GL can enhance the chemotherapeutic effects of triptolide.
Furthermore, it has been shown that GA, MTX, and
combination of GA and MTX (GA+MTX) suppressed the
expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in fibroblast-like synovial
(FLS) cells from CIA rats in a time-dependent manner,
and the suppressing effect is GA+MTX>MTX>GA [62].
Altogether, the possibility of that GL and GA
are utilized as the useful additive to RA treatments has
been well-studied in experiments and the underlying
mechanisms is, at least in part, attributable to suppression
of the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. The ongoing study in our
laboratory has preliminarily supported this possibility
(Figure 4), and the further studies in this field are expected.

Conclusions
RA exerts profound influence on health-related
quality of life, which imposed huge burdens on patients
physically, mentally, and economically [63]. The general
effectiveness of typically prescribed medications for
patients with RA, including NSAIDs and DMARDs,
has been far from satisfactory [1, 64]. Because COX-2derived TxA2 is not the molecular target of NSAIDs and
DMARDs, the limitations and negative side effects of
those drugs may be, at least in part, attributable to lack of
the effects on the COX-2/TxA2 pathway, which coupled
with the positive role of the COX-2/TxA2 pathway in
pathogenesis of RA suggests that the pharmacological
approaches targeting this pathway hold the potential as a
novel add-on therapy in therapeutic strategy of RA (Figure
3).
Understanding the mechanisms of action of the
herbs may provide new treatment opportunities for RA
