Abstract
The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) family, a unique
class of oncogenic phosphatases, consists of three members:
PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3. Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3
has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic
expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases
mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases
in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA–
mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in
the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth
in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule,
7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs
but not other phosphatases in vitro. The thienopyridone
showed significant inhibition of tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, induction of the p130Cas
cleavage, and anoikis, a type of apoptosis that can be induced
by anticancer agents via disruption of cell-matrix interaction.
Unlike etoposide, thienopyridone-induced p130Cas cleavage
and apoptosis were not associated with increased levels of
p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser15), a hallmark of genotoxic druginduced p53 pathway activation. This is the first report of a
potent selective PRL inhibitor that suppresses tumor cell
three-dimensional growth by a novel mechanism involving
p130Cas cleavage. This study reveals a new insight into the
role of PRL-3 in priming tumor progression and shows
that PRL may represent an attractive target for therapeutic
intervention in cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):1162–9]

Introduction
The activities of phosphatases and kinases represent a large
component of the posttranslational modifications that cells use to
regulate signal transduction. Phosphatases are as important as
kinases; their dysregulation is known to result in neoplastic disease.
The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) phosphatases, a
unique class of prenylated phosphatases, represent one such class
with an increasing association with oncogenic and metastatic
processes (1). This family of proteins consists of three closely
related members, PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3, which share 76% to 87%

amino acid sequence identity and a unique COOH-terminal
prenylation motif. Overexpression of PRL-1 or PRL-2 in epithelial
cells resulted in a transformed phenotype in culture and tumor
growth in nude mice (2, 3). PRL-3 was initially found amplified
and overexpressed in colorectal metastatic lesions compared
with normal colorectal epithelia and primary tumors (4). PRL-3
expression was elevated in nearly all metastatic samples derived
from colorectal cancers regardless of the site of metastasis (liver,
lung, brain, or ovary; ref. 5). Aberrant elevation of PRL-3 was also
found in various other human cancers, such as liver carcinomas,
gastric carcinomas, and ovarian cancers (6–8). In ovarian cancers,
PRL-3 expression correlated with disease progression, being higher
in advanced (stage III) than in early (stage I) tumors (8). Recent
analysis of survival variables in breast cancer patients revealed
shorter disease-free survival in patients with PRL-3–positive
carcinomas and suggests a role of PRL-3 as a prognostic factor
in breast cancer to predict worse disease outcome (9).
Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of PRL-3 in B16 cells
significantly increased lung and liver metastasis compared with
control cells when injected into mice. These transfectants also
exhibited altered extracellular matrix adhesive properties and upregulated integrin-mediated cell spreading efficiency (6). Additional
mechanistic studies showed that PRL phosphatases promote
motility and invasion by regulating the Rho family GTPase activity,
the key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (10). The
farnesylation of PRLs seems to be required for PRL-promoted cell
invasion and motility. PRL phosphatase activity has also been
shown to play an essential role in tumorigenesis. PRL-3 itself is
sufficient to trigger and complete multiple steps of metastasis,
whereas mutation of its catalytic domain can abolish the
metastatic processes (10).
In light of the collective evidence that supports a causative role
of PRL, and especially PRL-3, in tumor metastasis, targeting this
class of phosphatases may provide a novel approach to cancer
therapy. In the present study, we identified a selective smallmolecule PRL inhibitor that suppressed tumor cell anchorageindependent growth via the induction of p130Cas cleavage and
anoikis, a novel mechanism that seems independent of p53
activation.

endothelial-specific medium EGM-2 (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville,
Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Anti–PRL-3 antibody was purchased from R&D Systems. Pan-PRL
antibody was an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained from
rabbits immunized with the purified keyhole limpet hemocyanin–conjugated
peptide representing the COOH terminus of PRL-3 (Ac-Cys-Pro-Lys-Gln-ArgLeu-Arg-Phe-Lys-Asp-Pro-His-Thr-His-Lys-Thr-Arg-Ser-Ser-Val-Met-OH).
Additional antibodies included anti-p130Cas (BD Biosciences), anti–focal
adhesion kinase (FAK; Upstate), anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP;
Cell Signaling Technology), anti–caspase-8 (Cell Signaling Technology), antip53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–phospho-p53 (Ser15; Cell Signaling
Technology), and anti–h-actin (Sigma).
Western blot analysis. Cells were seeded in six-well plates 1 day before
compound treatment. Upon compound treatment as indicated in the figure
legends, cells were harvested and lysed immediately with 1 cell lysis buffer
(Cell Signaling Technology). Protein concentrations in whole-cell extracts
were determined and equal amounts of total protein (20 Ag) were resolved
on NuPAGE gradient gels (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes, and blotted with antibodies as indicated. The
protein expression was determined by densitometric quantitation of
specific band intensity using Multi Gauge Software (Fujifilm).
Small interfering RNA knockdown studies. Subconfluent cells (30%) in
six-well plates were transfected with 120 nmol/L nontargeting control and
PRL-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (Dharmacon) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection, cells were either seeded for soft agar assays or
stimulated with 200 nmol/L phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for
10 min, harvested, and subsequently analyzed by Western blot using
antibodies as indicated.

Soft agar assays. RKO or HT-29 cells, grown in DMEM (90%)/fetal
bovine serum (FBS; 10%) containing penicillin/streptomycin with or
without siRNA transfection, were plated in DMEM (80%) containing FBS
(20%), penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.3% agarose (FMC Bioproducts; top
layer) in a six-well plate over DMEM (90%) containing FBS (10%), penicillin/
streptomycin, and 0.5% agarose (FMC Bioproducts; bottom layer). The
following day, 0.5 mL of medium with or without PRL inhibitors was added
to the top layer and cells were allowed to incubate for 2 to 3 weeks.
Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant human fusion
His-PRL proteins. Full-length human fusion His6-PRL-1 and His6-PRL-3
cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using either human
brain (PRL-1) or human heart (PRL-3) mRNA (Clontech) as template. His6PRL-2 was generated from a plasmid obtained from ATCC. A hexa-His tag
was incorporated at the NH2 terminus of the forward primers. The
following primers were used: His6-PRL-1, 5¶-GGAATTCCATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGCTCGAATGAACCGCCCAGCTCCTGTGGAAGTC-3¶

were transfected with siRNA as indicated for 48 h and treated with PMA for 10 min, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using pan-PRL, phospho-p130Cas,
and total p130Cas antibodies as described in Materials and Methods. D, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs (against all three PRLs) for 36 h and starved in FBS-free
medium overnight. FBS was added with or without PMA treatment for 10 min and phospho-p130Cas and total p130Cas were analyzed by Western blot.

containing 20% glycerol, 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5
mmol/L EDTA, and 2 mmol/L DTT.
IC50 determination in immobilized metal ion affinity-based
fluorescence polarization assays. A bead-based immobilized metal ion
affinity-based fluorescence polarization (IMAP-FP) assay was performed
with purified recombinant PRL proteins and peptide substrate: TAMRAThr-Ala-Asp-Ile-Tyr(PO3H2)-Glu-NH2. In brief, the assay was performed in a
reaction solution containing 20 mmol/L Bis-Tris (pH 6.3), 0.05% Triton
X-100, and 10 mmol/L DTT in the presence of 4 Ag/mL of PRL proteins,
0.5 Amol/L of TAMRA-labeled peptide substrate, and various concentrations
of compounds. The highly phosphorylated peptide substrate binds to
nanoparticles derivatized with trivalent metal cations through a metalphospholigand interaction. PRL phosphatases cause a decrease in the
polarization signal by removing the phosphate group. The IMAP-FP assay
was performed in a 384-well plate format. The changes in fluorescence
polarization were measured by a ViewLux instrument with excitation at
525 nm and emission at 598 nm.
Phosphatase selectivity assay. The phosphatase activity across a panel
of phosphatases was measured as described previously (11), except that
6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferylphosphate (DiFMUP; Molecular Probes)
was used as substrate at the K m for each enzyme and 10 or 37.5 mmol/L
diethylglutarate (pH 6.2) was used in place of MES. The reaction was
stopped with KOH and the fluorescence of the dephosphorylated substrate
was measured (excitation at 360 nm/emission at 460 nm).
Cell proliferation assays. Cell viability was measured by the reduction of
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to for-

mazan. Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter dishes and exposed to various
concentrations of compounds on the following day and cultured for 5 days.
After the addition of 50 AL/well of a 5 mg/mL MTT stock in Dulbecco’s PBS,
the cells were incubated for an additional 2.5 h at 37jC. Thereafter, the
medium was removed and 50 AL of 100% ethanol were added to each well to
dissolve the formazan crystals. The conversion of MTT into formazan by
viable cells was assessed by a microplate reader at 570 nm. HUVEC viability
was assessed by the reduction of Alamar Blue, which was measured
spectrophotometrically. The procedure was done in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions (BioSource International, Inc.).
Cell migration assay. HUVEC migration was measured using a real-time
cell invasion and migration (RT-CIM) assay system (ACEA Biosciences, Inc.).
Cells (4  104) were seeded in the upper chamber in basal medium
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of DMSO or various
concentrations of compound. The lower chamber contained complete
HUVEC medium (EGM-2) with growth factors and additives. Cell migration
was monitored every 10 min for a period of 24 h.

levels have been reported in various cancer cells. To further
examine the protein expression levels of PRL-3 in cancer cells in a
tumor environment, we excised established human xenograft
tumors derived from 20 different cancer lines in nude mice and
analyzed the tumor tissue lysates by Western blot analysis using

anti–PRL-3 antibody. Screening results shown in Fig. 1A indicate
that PRL-3 protein expression varies among different tumor lines
without a clear correlation with tumor type or with any genetic
alterations, such as p53 mutation. It is worth noting that high
levels of PRL-3 protein were found in rat mammary adenocarcinoma MTLn3, a lung metastasis-derived subclone line with high
metastatic potential (12). We further analyzed PRL-3 protein
expression in three paired primary and metastatic tumor
lines, where each pair is derived from the same patient: (a)
SW480 (primary colorectal cancer) and SW620 (metastasis), (b)
Hs688(A).T (primary melanoma) and Hs688(B).T (metastasis), and
(c) WM115 (primary melanoma) and WM266-4 (metastasis). As
shown in Fig. 1B, relatively high levels of PRL-3 expression were
confirmed in two metastatic lines compared with their respective
primary lines.
Cellular consequences of PRL knockdown using siRNA. The
exact biological function of PRL is poorly understood, and a specific
PRL substrate has not been identified thus far. To investigate the
cellular consequences of PRL inhibition, we examined the effect of
PRL-3 knockdown on cell proliferation in two-dimensional and
three-dimensional culture conditions. In MTT assays of various
cancer cells under normal two-dimensional culture condition, there
were minimal changes in viability in cells transfected with PRL
siRNA or control siRNA (data not shown). Considering the tight
association of PRL-3 with cancer metastasis, we performed soft agar
assays to examine whether PRL-3 knockdown has an effect on cell
growth under three-dimensional culture condition. The human
colorectal cell line RKO was chosen because it expresses PRL-3 and
forms uniform colonies in soft agar. After transfection of PRL-3
siRNA or control siRNA for 24 h, RKO cells were plated in soft agar
and grown for 2 weeks. PRL-3 protein expression in RKO cells was
shown to be specifically abolished by siRNA (Fig. 2A). The depletion
of PRL-3 further led to the inhibition of anchorage-independent cell

growth in soft agar as shown in the top panel (representative images)
and the bottom panel (quantitative summary) of Fig. 2B. These
results agree with previous reports that specific knockdown of PRL-3
in cancer cells prevents their migration and invasion but not
proliferation (13, 14). To gain insight into the mechanistic role of
PRL, we systematically profiled the expression of various proteins in
cancer cells following knockdown of each individual PRL or a
combination of two/three PRLs. We focused our evaluation
primarily on those well-known proteins implicated in cell migration
and invasion. As shown in Fig. 2C (top), PRL expression was
completely knocked down by transfection of respective siRNA in
HeLa cells. The differential depletion patterns of PRL protein
expression in cells suggest that HeLa cells express high levels of
PRL-1 and PRL-2 but hardly any PRL-3. Interestingly, we found that
down-regulation of phosphorylated and total p130Cas levels was
associated with PRL knockdown and was more prominent in cells
transfected with all three PRL siRNAs (Fig. 2C, middle), whereas the
amount of control protein h-actin remained constant (Fig. 2C,
bottom). These results identify a functional link between PRL and
p130Cas and suggest a role for PRL in regulating p130Cas
phosphorylation and expression. Because p130Cas signaling is a
target of many exogenous stimuli, we further measured phosphop130Cas and total p130Cas levels in response to serum (FBS) and
PMA stimulation in cells with or without PRL knockdown. As shown
in Fig. 2D, increased levels of phospho-p130Cas were observed in
controls in response to PMA stimulus and total p130Cas was
induced by either FBS or PMA. Following transfection of PRL siRNAs
(PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3), the FBS- and PMA-induced elevation of
phospho-p130Cas and total p130Cas was significantly suppressed.
Our results reveal a functional role of PRL in the regulation of
exogenous growth/survival signaling-induced p130Cas pathway
activation, which may in turn contribute to a provocative role in
cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

Figure 4. Mechanistic action of the thienopyridone
in cancer cells. A, induction of proteolytic cleavage
of p130Cas and apoptosis in cancer cells by the
thienopyridone. HeLa cells were treated with various
concentrations of the thienopyridone or etoposide
for 24 h; the cellular extracts were analyzed by
Western blot using antibodies against p130Cas, FAK,
caspase-8, phospho-p53 (Ser15), p53, and h-actin as
indicated. B, the thienopyridone induced proteolytic
cleavage of p130Cas independent of p53 mutation
status in cancer cells. Human breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-435 (mutant p53) and human colorectal
cancer cell line RKO (WT p53) were treated with the
thienopyridone for 24 h. The cell lysates were analyzed
by Western blot using anti-p130Cas antibodies.

Identification of PRL inhibitor. Targeting PRL may be a useful
strategy to hinder cancer cell invasion and metastasis. To identify
PRL inhibitors, we established a high-throughput IMAP-FP
screening assay using purified recombinant PRL proteins. Using
the same peptide as the substrates, the concentration-dependent
changes in fluorescence polarization in assays showed that all three
PRL proteins have similar phosphatase activities (Fig. 3A). By
screening the Roche chemical library, positive hits were identified
by compound-induced reduction in fluorescence. Our primary
screen revealed a class of fused pyridone molecules as potent
reversible PRL inhibitors. The structure and activities of a selected
compound, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H -thieno[3,2-c ]pyridin-4-one,
referred to as the thienopyridone, are shown in Fig. 3B. It exhibited
similar IC50 values of 0.173, 0.277, and 0.128 Amol/L in PRL-1, PRL2, and PRL-3 phosphatase assays, respectively. To examine its
selectivity, we further examined activities of the thienopyridone in
a phosphatase assay panel of 11 other phosphatases representing
different classes of phosphatases, including tyrosine and dualspecific phosphatases. As shown in Fig. 3C, using DiFMUP as a
substrate for all protein phosphatase (PTPase) assays, the
thienopyridone displayed excellent selectivity against PRL-3
phosphatase with an IC50 of 0.457 Amol/L, but showed minimal
effects on other phosphatases.
Effects of PRL inhibitor on tumor cells and the mechanism
of action. After revealing specific cellular consequences of PRL
depletion using siRNA, we next examined the cellular effects of the
PRL inhibitor. A dose-dependent down-regulation of total p130Cas
was observed in HeLa cells treated with the thienopyridone PRL
inhibitor (Fig. 4A, row 1). Although the compound effect was not as

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

significant as that induced by PRL siRNAs, we found that the
thienopyridone induced a specific cleavage fragment recognized by
anti-p130Cas antibody (Fig. 4A, row 2). It has been reported that
proteolysis of p130Cas is associated with the induction of apoptosis
by different agents (etoposide, cisplatin, and celecoxib) and
generates a 31-kDa fragment (15, 16). This small fragment is
translocated to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional
repressor and leads to anoikis, a type of apoptosis caused by
disruption of cell-matrix interactions (17). To determine whether
the PRL inhibitor induced the same proteolysis of p130Cas, HeLa
cells were treated with the thienopyridone or with etoposide as a
control, and the cell extracts were run side by side. As shown in
Fig. 4A (rows 1 and 2), both the thienopyridone and etoposide
induced p130Cas cleavage and generated fragments that were
aligned at the same position on SDS-PAGE. Because the proteolysis
of p130Cas is associated with the onset of anoikis, we then examined
the possible cleavage of other components of the focal adhesion
complexes. We found that FAK was also cleaved by the thienopyridone PRL inhibitor, whereas etoposide only induced minimal FAK
cleavage, suggesting different kinetics from the p130Cas cleavage
(Fig. 4A, row 3). Furthermore, thienopyridone-induced p130Cas
and FAK cleavage led to caspase-mediated cell apoptosis as
evidenced by the simultaneous induction of the cleavage of PARP
and caspase-8 (Fig. 4A, rows 4 and 5). Etoposide-induced apoptosis
involved minimal caspase-8 cleavage consistent with a previous
report (15). Most genotoxic drugs, such as etoposide, are well known
to trigger cell death by inducing DNA damage and p53 pathway
activation. To further understand whether the PRL inhibitor has the
same mechanism of action, we then assessed the effects of both

PRL Inhibitor Induces the Cleavage of p130Cas

compounds on the p53 pathway. Our results showed that etoposide
but not the thienopyridone induced a posttranslational increase in
p53 levels, especially in phospho-p53 (Ser15) levels, a hallmark of
DNA-damaging agent-induced p53 pathway activation (Fig. 4A,
rows 6 and 7). In addition, thienopyridone-induced proteolysis of
p130Cas was detected in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer line (mutant
p53) and RKO colorectal cancer line [wild-type (WT) p53]
independent of the p53 gene mutation status (Fig. 4B). Together,
these results suggest that the PRL inhibitor induces p130Cas
cleavage and apoptosis via a novel mechanism that seems independent of p53 activity and is distinct from other anticancer drugs.
Next, we examined the effect of the thienopyridone on cancer
cell anchorage-independent growth. The human colorectal cancer
cells RKO and HT-29 express PRL-3 and form uniform colonies in
soft agar. After 2 weeks of culture in medium with or without

various concentrations of the thienopyridone, control (DMSOtreated) cells formed many colonies in soft agar, whereas the
thienopyridone-treated cells (both RKO and HT-29 cells) had
significant reduction in colony formation (Fig. 5A). The PRL
inhibitor exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition in cancer cell
anchorage-independent growth as measured by either colony
number or colony size (Fig. 5B). The EC50 values of the
thienopyridone were 3.29 and 3.05 Amol/L for RKO and HT-29
cells, respectively (Fig. 5A and B).
Effects of PRL inhibitors on HUVECs. Several published results
have shown a role for PRL-3 in both endothelial and malignant
cells (6, 13). PRL-3 mRNA has been detected in a subset of
endothelial cells in human colon samples (4). Basal level of PRL-3
mRNA is low in endothelial cells but can be increased upon PMA
exposure (13). We confirmed the expression of PRL-3 protein in

HUVECs and its up-regulation upon mitogen (PMA) stimulation
(Fig. 6A). Because PMA-stimulated HUVECs have shown
increased cell proliferation, cell invasion, and tube formation,
which correlates with high levels of PRL-3 expression (13), we
tested the effect of thienopyridone on HUVEC migration and
proliferation. HUVEC migration and viability were examined by
the RT-CIM assay system and the Alamar Blue assay,
respectively. As the results in Fig. 6B show, the thienopyridone
PRL inhibitor significantly suppressed HUVEC migration but not
proliferation when measured at the same time point after
compound treatment. This result suggests a potential role for
PRL inhibitors in targeting both endothelial and tumor cells. A
PRL inhibitor may serve as a therapeutic agent to simultaneously inhibit tumor angiogenesis and anchorage-independent
tumor cell growth.

Discussion
Dysregulation and clinical correlation of PRL protein expression
suggest a role for PRL in cancer invasion and metastasis. However,
the detailed mechanism remains largely unknown. By using PRL
siRNA and a small molecular PRL inhibitor, we specifically
abolished PRL expression or inhibited PRL activities in tumor
cells, which in parallel reveal a novel mechanistic link of PRL with
the p130Cas signaling pathway. p130Cas is a well-known adaptor
protein involved in cellular functions, such as survival, proliferation, and migration, and is therefore important in pathologic
processes, such as tumorigenesis and invasion (18). Cas was
initially identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate of
the oncogenes v-Crk and v-Src. Many growth factors and hormones
also regulate p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Increased p130Cas

phosphorylation is associated with cell motility and invasion (19).
Src-induced oncogenic transformation is associated with many
dramatic changes in cell morphology, actin organization, and
anchorage independence. p130Cas is an essential cofactor involved
in the Src-induced oncogenic process, as p130Cas-null cells cannot
be transformed by Src and are unable to grow in soft agar. Even
without Src transformation, p130Cas-null cells show defects in cell
spreading, actin bundling, and cell migration. We hypothesize that
PRL phosphatases might regulate the p130Cas signaling pathway,
which in turn leads to a promoting role in tumor metastasis.
Interestingly, PRL phosphatases have been found to stimulate the
Rho signaling pathway (10), and Rho family GTPases are also
critical regulators of actin organization associated with cell motility
and cell cycle progression. It is worth exploring further the
connective relationship between these molecules to better
understand the exact signaling networks among PRL, Src, Cas,
and Rho that are critical for tumor migration and invasion.
There is a close correlation between p130Cas cleavage and
anoikis (20). Multiple proapoptotic stimuli, such as anticancer
agent etoposide or cisplatin treatment, induce p130Cas cleavage to
generate a small 31-kDa fragment. This fragment is sufficient to
initiate anoikis and induce cell death. Constitutive phosphorylation
of p130Cas results in resistance to anoikis, leading to anchorageindependent tumor growth and metastasis. The present study
shows that p130Cas phosphorylation and expression can be downregulated in cells depleted of PRL. A recent report also shows that
PRL-1 knockdown decreased c-Src and p130Cas expression in
human lung cancer cells (21). The correlative expression found for
PRL and p130Cas suggests a role of PRL in the regulation of
p130Cas phosphorylation and expression. This is further supported
by the fact that the thienopyridone, a specific PRL inhibitor,
induced p130Cas cleavage, generated the same 31-kDa fragment,
and induced cell death. Unlike other anticancer drugs, PRL
inhibitor-induced p130Cas cleavage and cellular apoptosis seem
to be independent of p53 pathway activation. Interestingly, the
p130Cas cleavage was not observed in tumor cells in which all
PRLs were knocked down using siRNA. This is not unexpected.
Notably, PRL is a prenylated PTPase and prenylation is required for
the subcellular localization and full biological function of the
protein. Thus, the cellular consequences of PRL depletion may not
be completely identical to that of the inhibition of the phosphatase
activity of PRL by a small-molecule inhibitor. It is intriguing that
the PRL inhibitor did not induce p130Cas cleavage in three normal
cells, including Detroit 551 normal fibroblasts from skin, MR-90
normal fibroblasts from lung, and FHs 74 Int normal epithelial cells
from small intestine (data not shown), which may imply that
normal cells have a better apoptotic protective mechanism than
cancer cells. Indeed, the thienopyridone had minimal nonspecific
cytotoxic effects on these normal cells, as the EC90 values are all
above 30 Amol/L in MTT assays (data not shown). In addition, the
thienopyridone has no effect on HUVEC proliferation (Fig. 6B).
Because cancer deaths mainly result from tumor metastasis rather
than from primary tumors, our results suggest that a specific PRL
inhibitor may provide alternative clinical benefit in the treatment
of human cancer by affecting tumor migration and invasion via a
novel mechanistic action in regulating p130Cas expression.
To validate whether PRL represents a novel anticancer target,
we initiated discovery efforts to identify a potent selective
inhibitor. A group of fused pyridone compounds was revealed by
high-throughput screening. Some of these compounds seemed to
inhibit the phosphatase activities by a redox mechanism via

generation of a reactive oxygen species, which causes the
cyclization of DTT. However, several compelling lines of evidence
suggest that inhibition of PRLs by the thienopyridone is not due
to a redox mechanism. First, adding the thienopyridone to PRL-3
in a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment did not lead to the
appearance of peaks consistent with the oxidized form of PRL-3
(22), although it was able to oxidize DTT in vitro (data not shown).
Second, the thienopyridone possessed excellent selectivity inhibiting PRL but not 11 other phosphatases, which represent different
classes of phosphatase with diverse sequence, structure, and
function (Fig. 3C). Third, the thienopyridone had minimal
nonspecific cytotoxic effects on normal cells, including HUVEC
(Fig. 6B). Fourth, similar to siRNA-mediated PRL knockdown effect
in tumor cells, the thienopyridone also regulated p130Cas
expression and suppressed tumor cell anchorage-independent
growth (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). Fifth, the thienopyridone-induced cell
apoptosis was not associated with the DNA damage-induced p53
pathway activation that could be caused by a redox compound
(Fig. 4).

Despite the increasing evidence in vitro that suggests a causative
role of PRL in human cancers, the in vivo relevance of PRL in
tumorigenesis is not yet clear. In vivo knockout mice may further
define PRL function; however, there may be limitations in
determining its role in adulthood. A specific PRL inhibitor provides
a valuable tool to explore the regulatory connection between PRL
and Src, p130Cas, Rho, and other downstream target genes. To
ultimately show the development potential for a specific PRL
inhibitor as a novel anticancer agent, further extensive work on the
thienopyridone would be required due to concern about risks
associated with redox activity, although no evidence of any
selectivity or safety issues has been found in vitro.
