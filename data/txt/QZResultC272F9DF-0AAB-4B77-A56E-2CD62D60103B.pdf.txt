ABSTRACT:
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, a.k.a Lnc2) is a member
of the lipocalin family which has diverse roles including stabilizing matrix
metalloproteinase-9 from auto-degradation and as siderocalins which are important
in the transport of iron. NGAL also has important biological functions involved in
immunity and inflammation as well as responses to kidney damage. NGAL expression
has also been associated with certain neoplasia and is important in the metastasis of
breast cancer. Many advanced cancer patients have elevated levels of NGAL in their
urine and it has been proposed that NGAL may be a prognostic indicator for certain
cancers (e.g. breast, brain, and others). NGAL expression is detected in response
to various chemotherapeutic drugs including doxorubicin and docetaxel. We were
interested in the roles of NGAL expression in cancer and whether it is associated
with chemotherapeutic drug resistance. In the present study, we investigated
whether increased NGAL expression led to resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug
doxorubicin in normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), breast cancer cells (MCF7), and colorectal cancer cells (HT-29). We infected the various cell lines with a
retrovirus encoding NGAL which we constructed. Increased NGAL expression was
readily detected in the NGAL-infected cells but not the empty vector-infected cells.
However, increased NGAL expression did not alter the sensitivity of the cells to the
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Thus, although NGAL expression is often detected
after chemotherapeutic drug treatment, it by itself, does not lead to doxorubicin
resistance.

INTRODUCTION

results from intrinsic or extrinsic events. Over the past 35
years, many genes have been identified which can cause
or contribute to cancer [1,2]. These include two major
classes of genes, the oncogenes and the tumor suppressor
genes [3,4]. Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) and
epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important
in regulating cancer progression [5-8]. In some cases,

Identifying the pathways activated and critical for
cancer initiation and subsequent spread (invasion and
metastasis) are essential for improved cancer therapy. Also,
it is essential to understand how cells develop resistance to
various therapeutic approaches and whether the resistance

the genetic culprit involved in a particular cancer may
be known (e.g., BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia
[9,10]. However, in most cases, there are multiple genetic
and epigenetic events occuring which interact and develop
into a cancer cell capable of becoming metastatic and/
or drug resistant. In addition, there are other important
contributions by the tumor microenvironment which aid
in the progression of the cancer as well as resistance to
various therapeutic approaches and the survival of cancer
initiating cells [11-13].
One factor which may be important for cancer
survival and metastasis is neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin (NGAL). One of the genomic responses
to common cancer treatments such as radiation and
chemotherapy is the induction of NGAL expression [1419]. NGAL may act to stabilize MMP-9 and increase
its ability to degrade the extracellular matrix, hence
promoting metastasis.
NGAL expression is regulated by the transcription

factors: NF-kappaB, CEBP and others [20-24]. Radiation
and chemotherapy may induce reactive oxygen species
(ROS) that result in NF-kappaB activation [25,26] and
subsequent downstream NGAL transcription. In addition,
the tumor microevironment may alter NF-kappaB
activity [27]. Chemo- and radiotherapy could result in
the synthesis of NGAL in cancer cells which may lead
to the development of therapy-resistant cells. These cells
can contribute to the reemergence and metastasis of the
cancer as increased NGAL expression may allow the cells
to persist under conditions where the therapy-sensitive
cancer cells could not normally survive.
Cancer cells have increased demands for
intracellular iron. NGAL is a member of the lipocalin
family and as such is capable of serving as siderocalins
or molecules involved in the transport of iron and other
molecules [28]. Iron is essential for many key processes,
including the rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis carried
out by ribonucleotide reductase [29]. Iron (Fe++) is also

Figure 1: Overview of Potential Effects of NGAL on Cellular Growth. NGAL may serve diverse biochemical functions from
stabilizing MMP-9 at the cellular membrane in association with CD44 and E-Cadherin (E-Cad), to roles in promoting EMT and invasion.
In addition, NGAL may have roles in the transport of iron into the cell and influence iron-mediated gene expression. NGAL gene expression
is infuenced by many transcription figures including NF-κB, p53, and potential hormones such as the estrogen receptor (ER). Iron mediated
gene expression is complex and can influence the expression of many genes involved in cancer metastasis such as Twist, Slug, and Snail.

required for cells to progress through the cell cycle from
G1 to S phase. Tumor cells have a high requirement
for iron and express elevated levels of the transferrin
receptor-1 [30-34]. Novel chelators of iron are being
considered for cancer treatment [35]. Iron chelators, such
as Desferrioxamine (DFO), inhibit cellular iron transport
and have been evualated in various cancer clinical trials
[36]. Oxygen and iron concentrations may be altered in
the tumor microenvironment due to drastic tumor growth
[37-40]. In order for a cancer cell to survive, invade, and
metastasize it may have to have increased iron transport
as well as elevated glycolysis [11-14,40,41]. The role
of iron transport in chemotherapeutic drug resistance of
cancer cells is complex and may depend on the particular
drug and cancer type investigated [42,43]. Interestingly,
some iron depletors have been shown to decrease
resistance of certain cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs including doxorubicin [44,45].
Increased levels of NGAL have been detected in
the urine of patients with various types of cancer (i.e.
brain, breast, colon, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate).
Novel non-invasive urine-based tests could prove useful
for the detection and/or prognosis of many cancer types
[46-49].
The role(s) of NGAL in chemotherapeutic drug
resistance, invasion, and cancer metastasis are not
fully elucidated [15]. Targeting NGAL could result in
decreased cancer cell survival and tumor regression

as well as improve the effectiveness of radiation and
chemotherapy in cancer therapy. NGAL is considered
by some scientists to have properties of an oncogene. It
has been shown in some studies to increase the mobility,
invasion, metastasis, and tumorigenesis of certain cancer
cells [breast, colorectal cancer (CRC)] [50-52]. Elevated
expression of NGAL increases the invasiveness of certain
cancer cells, while inhibition of NGAL expression
decreases their invasiveness and metastasis [17, 19, 50].
New approaches to target MMP-9/NGAL are needed as
MMP-9 inhibitors have not performed well in clinical
cancer trials [54] and NGAL has functions which are
independent of MMP-9.
NGAL may exert many different effects that are
important in invasion and metastasis. NGAL can stabilize
MMP-9 at the cell surface [55-57]. This complex may be
associated with CD44 which may promote the cleavage
of E-Cadherin (E-Cad) into soluble (s)E-Cad thereby
promoting EMT [57,58]. A diagram illustrating potential
effects of NGAL on cell survival is presented in Figure
1. In the following studies, we examined the effects of
ectopic NGAL expression on the sensitivity of breast
cancer and CRC to a common chemotherapeutic drug
used to treat many cancer patients (doxorubicin, a.k.a
Adriamycin). We chose to examine the effects of ecotopic
NGAL expression on sensitivity to doxorubicin on two
different different types of cancers. Breast cancer which
is generally sensitive to doxorubicin therapy and CRC
which is considered resistant to doxorubicin therapy. An
immortalized breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, was
also examined in these studies.

RESULTS
Infection of Cell Lines with a Retrovirus
Encoding NGAL and Expression of Ectopic
NGAL.
MCF-10A, MCF-7, and HT-29 cells were infected
with a retrovirus encoding NGAL or the empty retrovirus
pLXSN. NGAL was detected in the supernatants from
NGAL retrovirus infected cells (Figure 2). In contrast,
NGAL was not detected in the empty vector pLXSN
virus infected cells.

Serial 2-fold dilutions (n=12 dilutions) of doxorubicin were dispensed

(Chappell AER paper in press) that were performed at the
same time. Clearly, the doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/DoxR
is approximately 20-fold more resistant to doxorubicin
than the MCF-7/pLXSN or MCF-7/NGAL cell lines
demonstrating that NGAL expression alone does not
confer doxorubicin resistance in these cells.
The doxorubicin IC50s for various NGAL- and
pLXSN-infected cell lines representing different tissues
are presented in Table 1. Increased NGAL expression did
not significantly (>2-fold) alter the IC50s for doxorubicin
in the cell lines examined.

sensitivity to doxorubicin of neither the breast cancer
nor CRC cells examined. Additionally, it did not alter the
sensitivity of the immortalized breast epithelial MCF-10A
cells. Note, it is also conceivable that elevated NGAL
expression could have made the cells more sensitive to
doxorubicin, but that did not appear to occur in these cells,
or other cells examined.
The doxorubicin resistant MCF-7/DoxR cell line
was also infected with the retrovirus encoding NGAL
(Figure 2), however, these cells were not more resistant to
doxorubicin than empty vector control MCF-7/DoxR cells
(data not presented). NGAL expression was not detected
at higher levels in drug resistant MCF-7/DoxR+pLXSN
cells than MCF-7/pLXSN (Figure 2). Moreover, the
doxorubicin resistant MCF-7/DoxR cells do not normally
express NGAL; however, upon treatment with doxorubicin
increased NGAL protein has been detected [59]. Elevated
NGAL expression does not appear, by itself, to increase
the resistance to doxorubicin in the cells examined. Such
changes could be occurring in the regulation of various
signaling pathways or drug transporters in these cells.
Although NGAL expression has been associated
with a poor prognosis in breast and other cancers
[24,60,61], elevated expression of NGAL does not alter
the IC50 for the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin.
Furthermore, elevated expression of NGAL did not
alter the responses of either the CRC line HT-29 or the

DISCUSSION.
These studies were undertaken to determine whether
increased NGAL expression altered the sensitivity to the
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin in cancer cell types
which are normally sensitive to doxorubicin (breast)
and cancer cell types which are normally resistant to
doxorubicin (CRC) as well as immortalized breast
epithelial cells (MCF-10A) which are not malignant.
NGAL may have roles in iron transport which may be
associated with chemoresistance in certain cancers.
Some studies have shown that iron chelators will reduce
chemotherapeutic drug resistance [44,45]. However, in
our studies, elevated NGAL expression did not alter the

Construction of Retroviral Vector Containing
NGAL.

immortalized epithelial line MCF-10A to doxorubicin.

MATERIALS & METHODS.

The pLXSN/NGAL retroviral expression vector
(referred to here and throughout this study as NGAL) was
constructed using the retroviral vector pLXSN (Clontech©,
Mountain View, CA) as the backbone. The full length
cDNA of human NGAL (Lcn2, GenBank accession no.
BC033089) was amplified from the pcDNA3.1(+)-NGAL
plasmid [51] using specific primers for regions flanking
either ends of the gene insert. The PCR product was then
inserted into a pCR2.1-TOPOR TA vector (Invitrogen™,
Carlsbad, CA), subsequently digested with EcoRI
endonuclease (New England Biolabs®, Ipswich, MA), and
the resulting gene fragment was ligated into the EcoRI
digested pLXSN vector.

Cell Lines and Growth Factors.
The breast cancer (MCF-7) and CRC (HT-29) cell
lines were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD,
USA). Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator at 37°C with RPMI-1640 [(RPMI) Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA] supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA, USA).
This complete RPMI media is abbreviated cRPMI. The
immortalized breast epithelial MCF-10A line was obtained
from the ATCC and cultured in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen)
medium containing: 2.5mM L-glutamine, supplemented
with 5% heat inactivated equine serum (Invitrogen),
500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 21.5 ng/ml
epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (SigmaAldrich), and 15mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich).

Packaging of Retroviral Vectors.
Packaging of the retroviral vectors used in this
study was as follows. 10 mL of a 0.1 % gelatin/sterile
water solution (Specialty Media, Chemicon/Millipore™,
Billerica, MA) was used to gelatin coat Corning 75 cm2
flasks (Corning, NY) for one hour at room temperature
and then removed. Following two subsequent washes
with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (110 mM
NaCl, 2.1 mM KCl, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 6.7 mM Na3PO4,
pH 7.4), 6 x 106 total 293T cells were plated in 10 mL
cDMEM and allowed to adhere at 370C overnight to the
gelatin coated flasks. The next day, the culture media
was removed and replaced with 10 mL fresh cDMEM
one hour prior to transfection. DNA calcium phosphate
precipitation was used to transfect 293T cells. 15 μg of
the packaging vector pCL-Ampho (Imgenex©, San Diego,
CA) was mixed with 35 μg of pLXSN/NGAL, in 1.5 mL
of 0.25 M CaCl2. This mixture was then added drop wise
to 1.5 mL of 2X HBS (50 mM HEPES, 280 mM NaCl2,
1.5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.17) and allowed to precipitate
at room temperature for 45 minutes. After the precipitate
incubation time, the solution of calcium-phosphate/DNA
was added to the T75 flask of 293T cells and incubated
for six hours at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5%
CO2. Media was then removed and replaced with 9 mL
of a 15% glycerol/PBS solution for one minute at room
temperature. This solution was then removed and the cells
gently washed once with 1X PBS before adding back
10 mL of fresh cDMEM. Spent media containing the
packaged virus particles were harvested 48 and 72 hours
later. The viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm
PVDF filter (Millipore™,Billerica, MA) to remove cellular
debris, aliquoted, and used fresh for subsequent retroviral
transductions or stored frozen at -80°C for later use. The
viral supernatants were used to infected the various cell
lines and stable transformed pools or either NGAL or
pLXSN (empty vector control) were selected in media

Methylthiazol Tetrazolium Assay.
Methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assays were
performed to determine a cell line’s sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic drugs. 2 x 103 cells per well were
plated in 96-well plates in 100 μL of cRPMI without
phenol red (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA) and allowed to
attach overnight under normal culture conditions. The
next day, serial two-fold dilutions of a chemotherapeutic
drug were made and 100 μL of each dilution were
added to a corresponding well on the 96-well plate.
Cells were incubated for four days under normal culture
conditions. On the fourth day, 22.2 μL of a 5 mg/mL
solution of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (SigmaAldrich, Saint Louis, MO) in 1X PBS was added to each
well and incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C. The media
was then removed and 150 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was added
to resuspend formazin crystals to produce a purple
color which was subsequently read on a Multiskan EX
Microplate photometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson,
NH) at a wavelength of 570 nm. Colormetric readings
were normalized against plates of non-treated cells
under identical culture conditions. Relative growth was
calculated by dividing normalized cell growth values in
the presence of drugs by normalized cell growth values in
the absence of drugs and the results were graphed. Drug
concentrations that killed at least 50% of the cells (IC50)
were determined from the calculated graphed values [62].

Detection of Secreted NGAL
Supernatant lysates used to determine the levels
of NGAL protein in the supernatant were harvested and
prepared as follows. All cell lines were plated in 6-well
plates and cultured under normal culture conditions in
cRPMI. Once the cells reached 80% confluency the media
were removed, the cells were washed twice with 1X PBS,
and 2 mL of fresh RPMI without FBS was added back.
After 24 hours, the supernatants were harvested, cleared
of cellular debris via centrifugation, and processed. Total
protein from the collected supernatants was isolated by
mixing 1 mL of the sample with 250 μL of 100% (w/v)
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (Sigma-Aldridge, Saint Louis,
MO) and incubating the mixture at 4°C for 15 minutes.
The sample pellets were collected via centrifugation at
14000 RPM for 15 minutes. The pellets were washed
twice with ice cold 100% acetone and allowed to air dry.
The protein pellets were resuspended in 25 μL of western
sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, and examined by
western blot analysis.
20 μL of the prepared supernatant samples was
separated on 12% Tris-glycine poly-acrylamide gels and
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). All membranes were
blocked in 1X Tris-buffered saline + Tween-20 (TBST)
(32 mM Tris, 125 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20, pH 8)
containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fisher/
Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) overnight at 4°C with
gently shaking. Blocked membranes were placed in
appropriate dilutions of the NGAL antibody [50] in 1x
TBST + 1% BSA overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking.
The next day, membranes were washed four times with 1X
TBST before adding the appropriate secondary antibody
made up in 1X TBST plus 5% non-fat dry milk for one
hour. After another round of four washes, the membranes
were treated with horseradish peroxidase enhanced
chemiluminescence (Pierce/Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) as per manufacturer’s instructions and protein bands
visualized via exposure to X-ray film (Research Products
42 International, Mount Prospect, IL). 0.1% coomassie
brilliant blue R250 (CBB) (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 50%
methanol/7% acetic acid solution was used to stain total
protein on the cellular supernatant immunoblots as a
loading control.
