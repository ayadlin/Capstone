BACKGROUND: The objective of this meta-analysis in patients with myeloma was to test the hypothesis that the addition of bortezomib to induction therapy not only improves the depth of response but also improves post-transplant progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) outcomes. METHODS: Phase 3 trials that randomized newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible patients with myeloma to receive either a bortezomib-containing induction regimen (BCIR) or a nonbortezomib-containing induction regimen (NBCIR)
were identified. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were adapted for data
synthesis, and comprehensive meta-analysis software was used to report pooled data as hazard ratios or odds ratios under a
random-effects model. RESULTS: Four published phase 3 trials that included 2169 patients were analyzed. The postinduction and
post-transplant pooled odds ratio for achieving a complete response=near complete response or a very good partial response or better and the overall response rate were higher with BCIR. The pooled hazard ratios for 3-year PFS and OS were 0.71 (95% confidence
interval, 0.60-0.83; P <.00,001) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.96; P 5.014), respectively, favoring BCIR. The odds of developing selected grade 3 toxicities (peripheral neuropathy and varicella-zoster virus reactivation) also were higher with BCIR. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis demonstrated that BCIR results in an improved depth of response, which translates into
improved post-transplant PFS and OS outcomes despite a higher incidence of toxicity. This analysis supports the concept that the

choice of induction regimen can influence post-transplant outcomes such as PFS and OS. Cancer 2013;119:4119-28. V

INTRODUCTION
The use of high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) was the first therapeutic approach that
improved overall survival (OS) for patients with multiple myeloma.1,2 However, to date, no specific induction regimen
has demonstrated an impact on post-transplant survival, suggesting that the use of high-dose melphalan was the major factor impacting disease control and, ultimately, OS. The choice of induction regimen had no impact, because most induction regimens were largely alkylator or steroid based and resulted in a very low overall response rate (ORR) and a low
complete remission rate. It is established that the use of newer, more active agents as part of induction regimens, such as
bortezomib,3,4 thalidomide,5,6and lenalidomide,4,7-9 improve the ORR and the complete response (CR) rate before
HDT and ASCT, but it is not clear from current phase 3 trials whether the impact of achieving a better response before
and after ASCT has an impact on OS.10 This lack of a quantifiable impact of induction regimens on survival is likely a
consequence of smaller sample sizes and multiple, confounding maintenance approaches within a single trial, ultimately
rendering OS an uninterruptable endpoint in the context of individual randomized clinical trials.
In the recent past, 4 randomized trials11-14 were performed that compared a bortezomib-containing induction regimen (BCIR) versus a standard, nonbortezomib-containing induction regimen (NBCIR). It was our hypothesis that a
greater depth of response before and after HDT associated with the use of BCIR would improve the post-transplant

endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. To
test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of these
4 large, randomized trials that, in aggregate, compared the
impact of BCIR versus NBCIR on attaining a pretransplant CR=near complete response (nCR) or a “very good
partial response or better” (VGPR) and on the ORR in
transplant-eligible patients; and we evaluated the sequential impact of these improved responses on posttransplant PFS and OS. We also assessed the impact of
BCIR and NBCIR on regimen-related grade 3 toxicities
associated with the inclusion of bortezomib to better
understand the full impact of BCIR from a risk and benefit perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search Methodology and Data Sources

We conducted an electronic literature search of PubMed
(MEDLINE), the Cochrane Library, and the EMBASE
database using the keywords “myeloma,” “bortezomib,”
“induction therapy,” and “transplant-eligible,” restricting
the search to exclusively identify randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that took place from May 2003 (when the
US Food and Drug Administration approved bortezomib
4120

for use in patients with relapsed myeloma who had
received at least 1 prior therapy) to August 2012. In addition, we performed a manual search of the annual meeting
conference proceedings of American Society of Hematology (ASH), the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO), and the European Hematology Association
(EHA). Prospective trial registers (available at: www.
clinicaltrials.gov) were explored for relevant, ongoing
trials. Our search strategy for study selection is outlined
in Figure 1.
Selection Criteria and Data Extraction

We followed the systematic methodology for trial identification and data synthesis described in the Cochrane Collaboration for Systematic Reviews and Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA)15 guidelines for reporting the results
of the meta-analysis. We included only phase 3 RCTs that
randomized younger, transplant-eligible patients with
myeloma to receive BCIR versus NBCIR therapies before
transplant. For this meta-analysis, studies were considered
if they reported the clinical outcomes of response rates
(CR, VGPR, ORR postinduction, ORR post-ASCT),
post-transplant time to events (PFS and OS), and grade

3 toxicities. The appropriate outcome data were
extracted from the published reports of the RCTs using
previously described methods.16,17 The pertinent
abstracts from the potential studies identified by the literature search were manually reviewed for eligibility. The full
text of any abstract that appeared to be eligible was carefully examined for inclusion after a meticulous assessment
of the methodological quality of the trial. In total, 69
RCTs were screened, as illustrated in Figure 1. Among the
12 eligible RCTs that used BCIR before transplant, 6 trials that did not have an NBCIR comparator arm to assess
the impact of bortezomib as a part of the induction regimen were excluded. Among the remaining RCTs, 2 were
excluded, because 1 study reported subgroup data18 and
another reported updated survival from a second randomization.19 Any disagreements were resolved by consensus
among the authors. Data were extracted and independently confirmed from the selected articles using standardized case report forms. The name of the group
performing the specific study has been used to identify
each trial in this analysis. In the Program for Study and
Therapeutics of Malignant Hemopathies (PETHEMA)
trial, the 2 BCIR arms (bortezomib, thalidomide, and
dexamethasone [VTD] and vincristine, carmustine
[BCNU], melphalan, cyclophosphamide, prednisone=vincristine, BCNU, doxorubicin, dexamethasone=bortezomib [VBMCP=VBAD=B]) were combined,
and aggregate results were compared with results from the
NBCIR arm (thalidomide and dexamethasone [TD]).
Statistical Analysis and Outcome Measures

The current meta-analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software package (version
2.2.057; Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ). A random model
meta-analysis was performed for the primary analysis to
calculate the relative risk of BCIR with the comparator
arm. The outcome data were pooled and are reported as
hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary
outcomes of interest were response rates (CR, VGPR,
and ORR) after induction and the same outcomes after
ASCT. Secondary outcomes of interest were PFS and OS
from study entry and grade 3 toxicities. Pooled outcomes under the random-effects model meta-analysis are
displayed as forest plots. An HR <1.00 for PFS or OS signifies an advantage for BCIR, with lower rates of death
and=or disease progression. The relative risk, defined as
an OR >1.00 for CR, VGPR, and ORR, suggests the
superior efficacy of BCIR. An OR <1 for grade 3 toxicities implies lesser toxicity with BCIR. To improve the efCancer

ficiency and reliability of the survival endpoints in the
current analysis, we used previously described methods
for extracting estimates.16 The Hemato-Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands=German-Speaking
Myeloma Multicenter Group (HOVON-GMMG) study
was the only trial that reported an OS difference. To prove
that no single trial influenced the aggregate results of the
meta-analysis, a “1 study excluded” analysis also was
performed.
Consistency of Effect Sizes

The consistency of results (effect sizes) among studies was
investigated by means of 2 heterogeneity tests: the chisquare-based Cochran Q test and the I2 statistic, which
was determined from the forest plot statistics. We considered that heterogeneity was present when the P value of
the Cochran Q test was < .1 and the I2 statistic was
>50% (P  .1 and I2 < 0.25 reflected low-level heterogeneity).20 In addition, to further assess for publication bias,
we used Begg and Egger funnel plots.21
RESULTS
Study Selection

Four RCTs that included a total of 2169 patients and
were available as published articles were included in the
final analysis. All trials had similar inclusion criteria for
newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible patients. All studies
reported the clinical outcomes of postinduction response
rates postinduction and post-ASCT (CR, VGPR, and
ORR), survival outcomes (PFS and OS), and grade 3
toxicities. Three trials (the French Myeloma Intergroup
[IFM] trial, the GIMEMA trial, and PETHEMA=Spanish Myeloma Group [PETHEMA=GEM] trial) were prospectively designed to assess the rates of CR=nCR
postinduction as the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint of the fourth trial, the HOVON-GMMG trial, was
PFS post-ASCT.
Patient Characteristics of Included Trials

Summary characteristics of the patients enrolled in the 4
RCTs are provided in Table 1. The median sample size
for the RCTs was 478 patients, with a median of 250
patients in the BCIR arm and 240 patients in the NBCIR
arm. The median age of all included patients was 57 years
in both arms. The BCIR and NBCIR arms were well balanced, as expected from RCTs. The percentages of men
and women were 56% and 44%, respectively, in the
BCIR arm versus 55% and 45%, respectively, in the
NBCIR arm; the percentages of patients who had the paraprotein isotypes immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin

83%, respectively (4 trials; n 5 1148), compared with 10%,
22%, and 65%, respectively, in the NBCIR arm (4 trials;
n 5 1021). Similar pooled CR=nCR rates post-ASCT were
45% versus 25% comparing the BCIR arm versus the
NBCIR arm, respectively. After ASCT, the VGPR rate
for BCIR versus NBCIR was 65% versus 44%, respectively,
and the ORR was 87% versus 79%, respectively (3 trials;
n 5 889 patients in the BCIR arm and n 5 894 patients in
NBCIR arm; specifics were unavailable for the PETHEMA=GEM trial). Heterogeneity was present for the ORR
post-ASCT because of a single study (IFM) that reported a
lower ORR (P 5 .022; I2 5 73.93) (Table 2). Hence, the
significance of BCIR in the resultant ORR post-ASCT may
have been underestimated. When the IFM trial was
excluded from the analysis, the OR for ORR increased from
2.0 to 2.4 (95% CI, 1.75-3.32).

In the PETHEMA/GEM trial, the 2 BCIR arms were combined, and aggregate results are presented.

Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival

For each individual trial, the PFS favored BCIR; and, in
aggregate, the pooled PFS favored BCIR (HR, 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.60-0.83; P 5 .00,001). When OS was evaluated,
only 1 of the 4 RCTs demonstrated improved OS; however, in aggregate, OS favored BCIR (HR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.66-0.95; P < .014) (Fig. 3). There was no significant
heterogeneity in the HRs of individual trials (PFS:
P 5 .725; I2 5 0.00; OS: P 5 .941; I2 5 0.00) (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analysis

The Begg and Egger funnel plots for all endpoints demonstrated a symmetrical distribution, suggesting an absence
of publication bias (Fig. 3).20,21 We performed sensitivity
analyses with 1 study removed for both the primary and
secondary endpoints, and those analyses indicated that no
individual study influenced the pooled results of the
RCTs. The results excluded the chance that any single
trial was over-weighted with respect to its effect on the
outcome overall.
Adverse Events

In assessing grade 3 adverse events, the OR for peripheral neuropathy (PN) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)
reactivation was higher for BCIR therapies (PN: OR,
3.03; 95% CI, 1.97-4.32; P 5 .000; VZV: OR, 4.807;
95% CI, 1.88-12.30; P 5 .001). The risk of grade 3
4124

thrombocytopenia with BCIR was nonsignificant in the
meta-analysis. When the PETHEMA=GEM trial was
excluded from the analysis, the OR for thrombocytopenia
was 2.16 (95% CI, 0.93-5.05; P 5 .07), trending toward
significance. It is known that bortezomib induces transient and reversible thrombocytopenia because of temporary arrest in megakaryopoeisis.22 The risk of grade 3
infections, anemia, and neutropenia was similar between
the BCIR and NBCIR arms (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
A hallmark of the use of bortezomib and lenalidomide in
myeloma therapy has been higher response rates in the
induction setting. However, the impact of these novel
agents on post-transplant outcomes has been less clear.
Although the short-term endpoints of ORR and depth of
response are clearly important, demonstrating an
improvement in the more objective endpoint of OS has
remained challenging because of the numerous postinduction variations in therapy that confound survival analysis.
However, the aggregation of data in the current metaanalysis demonstrates that BCIRs not only collectively
improve pretransplant ORR, VGPR, and CR rates but
also improve the post-ASCT endpoints of PFS and OS.
The current meta-analysis provides an opportunity to
view these 4 trials in aggregate rather than as 4 separate
BCIRs and to directly compare them with “older,”

conventional NBCIRs. The demonstration of superiority
for BCIR is even more striking in the context that each
trial used different high-dose (single vs tandem) and posttransplant (maintenance and consolidation) strategies,
which could have confounded the interpretation had this
been a smaller analysis. To eliminate the possibility that
the final result was because of an over-influence of any
individual study, each individual trial was removed, and
the remaining 3 trials were analyzed for the same endpoints. When we used this single-trial exclusion method,
there was no change in the final conclusion of the analysis
(Fig. 5). This supports our hypothesis that the benefit of
BCIR in PFS and OS was not influenced by any single
trial or maintenance strategy.
Our current approach has potential limitations common to all meta-analyses, and these include the inclusion
of trials with different methodologies, different study
designs, inconsistent endpoints, and different duration of
follow-up. Given these differences among the 4 large

a nonbortezomib-containing induction regimen (NBCIR) for each individual study and for the pooled results. The incidence of (A)
grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and (B) grade 3 varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation was higher for the BCIR arm. Differences in the incidence of (C) grade 3 neutropenia, (D) grade 3 infections, (E) grade 3 anemia, and (F) grade 3 thrombocytopenia were not statistically significant between the BCIR arm and the NBCIR arm.

randomized trials, some degree of statistical heterogeneity
was anticipated, yet this was only noted with regard to the
post-transplant ORR. An explanation for this low rate of
heterogeneity is the relative uniformity of the target group
of younger patients that was common to each trial.
Although each trial used a different post-transplant strategy (Table 2), what was common to all of them was the
use of bortezomib as part of the induction phase of therapy. Furthermore, the Begg and Egger funnel plots for all
primary and secondary endpoints and the analysis specifically designed to evaluate for possible publication bias further supported the validity and robustness of the analyses
and the absence of publication bias. One other limitation
of our meta-analysis was the limited number of studies (4
4126

RCTs) that fit the inclusion criteria, which precluded us
from pursuing any further subgroup analysis (eg, comparing BCIR vs either combined vincristine, doxorubicin,
and dexamethasone or TD).
Although BCIR is able to confer a survival benefit,
some noteworthy adverse events are observed with this
approach and should be used to balance the risk=benefit
ratio when assessing an individual patient or treatment
strategy. It is well known that the incidence of PN is
increased with bortezomib-based induction therapy, and
6% to 11% of patients suffered from grade 3 or 4 PN
among those who received BCIRs. Most patients who
were enrolled on the 4 included trials had received treatment before data were available evaluating the use of

either weekly or subcutaneous bortezomib dosing, thus
making it difficult to interpret the incidence and severity
of adverse events in the context of more recent administration standards. It remains clear that appropriate and
timely evaluations before initiating each cycle of therapy
with prompt dose reductions of bortezomib upon the development of early signs of PN can modulate these adverse
effects, but they can be limiting despite the use of careful
monitoring and newer administration strategies. In addition, the incidence of VZV reactivation is associated with
bortezomib-based treatment23 and is now managed
through the use of antiviral prophylaxis for all patients
who receive bortezomib. Thrombocytopenia is also a
known effect of BCIR, although, in the current analysis,
this was only observed to any significant degree in 1 of the
4 clinical trials (PETHEMA) and may have be a conseCancer

quence of combining bortezomib with alkylator-based
induction therapy.
Although the scope of this meta-analysis applies
only to BCIR versus NBCIR, we could make the case that
any regimen that induces a high ORR and a high depth of
response would yield similar results. Thus, induction regimens that contain lenalidomide or the newer secondgeneration proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib or
MLN9708), which have demonstrated the ability to
induce a high ORR and a high CR rate, probably would
produce a similar improvement in PFS and OS posttransplant compared with older, conventional treatments.
Thus, the current analysis supports the use of newer
strategies directed toward an improved pretransplant
response with the goal of improving post-transplant PFS
and OS.

In conclusion, the current data support the use of
BCIR for patients who are eligible for transplant, demonstrating improved ORR before and after ASCT as well as
improved PFS and OS compared with NBCIR. Although
bortezomib-based induction regimens are used extensively
in the United States and Europe, their use in other parts
of the world is more limited. Our analysis supports their
use over conventional induction regimens to improve OS
for younger, transplant-eligible patients. Future studies
with second-generation proteasome inhibitors or combinations with better tolerated immunomodulatory drugs
may further augment the risk=benefit ratio by reducing
the incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse
events associated with BCIR.
