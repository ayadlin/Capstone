ABSTRACT
The presence of tumor cells in the circulation is associated with a higher risk of
metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Circulating breast tumor cells use tubulinbased structures known as microtentacles (McTNs) to re-attach to endothelial
cells and arrest in distant organs. McTN formation is dependent on the opposing
cytoskeletal forces of stable microtubules and the actin network. AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular metabolic regulator that can alter actin and
microtubule organization in epithelial cells. We report that AMPK can regulate the
cytoskeleton of breast cancer cells in both attached and suspended conditions. We
tested the effects of AMPK on microtubule stability and the actin-severing protein,
cofilin. AMPK inhibition with compound c increased both microtubule stability and
cofilin activation, which also resulted in higher McTN formation and re-attachment.
Conversely, AMPK activation with A-769662 decreased microtubule stability and cofilin
activation with concurrent decreases in McTN formation and cell re-attachment. This
data shows for the first time that AMPK shifts the balance of cytoskeletal forces in
suspended breast cancer cells, which affect their ability to form McTNs and re-attach.
These results support a model where AMPK activators may be used therapeutically
to reduce the metastatic efficiency of breast tumor cells.

their detection and the development of therapies to treat
metastasis.
Activation of the adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway has shown
great promise in the treatment of breast cancer in preclinical models. AMPK is a master regulator of cellular
metabolism and works to maintain metabolic homeostasis
through its nutrient-sensing capabilities. It is activated
by phosphorylation at threonine 172 when the cellular
AMP:ATP ratio increases during metabolic stress [5, 6].
Pharmacologic activators of AMPK, such as metformin,
phenformin, AICAR, and A-769662, inhibit or delay
primary breast tumor growth in vivo and induce cell death
of breast tumor cells [7–11]. Furthermore, metformin is

INTRODUCTION
Primary breast cancers shed millions of cells into
circulation during the early steps of tumor formation.
These single disseminated cells, known as circulating
tumor cells (CTCs), can go on to invade distant sites
and cause metastatic disease [1]. The presence of CTCs
is associated with decreased overall and progressionfree survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer
[2, 3]. While metastasis remains the leading cause of
mortality in patients diagnosed with breast cancer, there
are currently no treatments to specifically target the
metastatic cascade [4]. A better understanding of CTC
biology and specific markers on CTCs are needed for

currently being investigated in a number of clinical trials
as a potential adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy for
breast cancer patients [12]. A number of non-classical
drugs with anti-neoplastic activity have also been shown to
activate AMPK as part of their mechanism of action [13].
Therefore, there is currently great interest in developing
more selective pharmacological activators of AMPK for
clinical use in cancer [14]. Although a great deal of work
has been done to study the effects of AMPK on primary
tumor formation, its effects on breast cancer metastasis are
still largely unknown.
In order to form distant metastases, breast cancer
cells must detach from the extracellular matrix (ECM)
and enter into the bloodstream or lymphatic system.
Once detached, these CTCs undergo a variety of changes,
both molecularly and structurally, to adapt to the new
microenvironment. After detachment and survival in the
circulation, CTCs must re-attach and arrest at a secondary
site [15, 16]. Tumor cell re-attachment is a process
dependent on stable microtubules [17–21]. Detached
breast tumor cells form microtubule-based protrusions,
known as microtentacles (McTNs), that aid in CTC
aggregation and re-attachment to endothelial cells [19,
22–24]. Therefore, McTNs are critical structures that
may be an important therapeutic target to prevent CTC
re-attachment.
McTN formation is dependent on the balance of
two opposing cytoskeletal forces: the outward force of
stabilized microtubules and the inward contractile force
of the actin cortex [19]. Currently two post-translational
modifications on alpha tubulin, detyrosination and
acetylation, play a significant role in McTN formation
[22, 25]. Detyrosination removes the C-terminal tyrosine,
exposing a glutamic acid residue, and acetylation
takes place on the lysine 40 residue of alpha tubulin
by alpha tubulin acetyl-transferase (αTAT1/MEC-17)
[26, 27]. Both of these modifications are indicators of
stabilized microtubules [26–28]. Microtubule stability
is associated with greater re-attachment of suspended
tumor cells to endothelial monolayers and lung trapping
in a murine experimental metastasis model [17, 19, 20,
29]. Increasing glu-tubulin levels, both genetically and
pharmacologically, results in greater McTN formation
and enhanced suspended cell re-attachment [20, 23, 29,
30]. Elevated acetylated tubulin levels are associated
with a higher metastatic phenotype in breast cancer
cells and can enhance both McTN formation and reattachment. In addition, higher levels of acetylated
tubulin are enriched in the more aggressive, basal-like
subtype of breast cancers and correlate with decreased
overall and progression-free survival of breast cancer
patients [25]. Conversely, McTNs are antagonized by
the actin cytoskeleton. One major regulator of actin
that also plays a significant role in McTN formation is
the actin-severing protein, cofilin. Cofilin is activated
upon dephosphorylation at serine 3, which results in a
breakdown of the actin network and increases actin

monomers [31]. Activation of cofilin in detached breast
epithelial cells promotes McTN formation [24]. There
is data to show that AMPK can affect both microtubules
and actin in normal epithelial cells [32, 33], but the role
of AMPK in regulating the cytoskeleton of breast tumor
cells has not yet been investigated.
While the metastatic dissemination of CTCs offers
a critical window for cytoskeletal-based therapeutic
intervention, microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapies
such as taxanes, have cytotoxic side effects and can
enhance tumor cell re-attachment [23, 34]. Existing and
developing pharmacological AMPK activators that have
shown benefit in the primary tumor setting may now also
be a potential therapeutic option to decrease the metastatic
efficiency of detached breast tumor cells. In this study, we
provide a novel role for AMPK in breast cancer. AMPK
inhibition with a pharmacologic inhibitor, compound c,
significantly increases microtubule stability and cofilin
activation, which leads to increased McTN formation and
re-attachment in breast cancer cell lines. AMPK activation
with A-769662 has an opposing effect, significantly
reducing McTNs and tumor cell re-attachment by
decreasing cofilin activity and microtubule stability.

RESULTS
A pharmacological approach was utilized to
understand the effects of altering the AMPK pathway
on the cytoskeletal properties of breast cancer cells. We
chose two different breast cancer cell lines for this study:
a non-metastatic, epithelial cell line, MCF-7 [36] and
a more invasive, mesenchymal cell line, BT-549 [37],
due to their differences in basal AMPK phosphorylation
levels and aggressiveness. MCF-7 cells have more
epithelial character and thus higher levels of basal AMPK
phosphorylation compared to the more mesenchymal BT549 cells (data not shown). In order to understand how
AMPK-directed drugs would affect the cytoskeleton of
these two different cell types, we used the small molecules
compound c and A-769662. Compound c (dorsomorphin
dihydrochloride) can potently block AMPK activation
[38, 39]. A-769662 can allosterically activate AMPK and
also inhibit the dephosphorylation of AMPK on threonine
172, making it more specific for AMPK [40, 41]. Previous
studies using these drugs in breast cancer have focused
solely on their effects on cell growth and death [7, 8, 42].
In this study, we were interested in understanding the
effects of these drugs on the cytoskeleton at earlier time
points.

AMPK inhibition increases cofilin activation and
microtubule stability
MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were first treated, under
attached conditions, with varying doses of compound c
to find the optimum dose for AMPK inhibition (Figure
1A and 1C). A dose of 20 μM was chosen based on

maximum pAMPK inhibition at threonine 172. MCF-7
and BT-549 cells were treated with 20 μM compound c
for varying times (Figure 1B and 1D) to determine the
optimum time course of treatment was less than 4 hours.
Drug treatment did not induce cytotoxicity at these early
time points (Supplementary Figure S1A). Using an assay
that is independent of cellular metabolism [35], we found
that compound c had comparable effects on cell growth in
MCF-7 and BT-549 cells (Supplementary Figure S2A and
S2B) as previously established [39].
Compound c treatment also resulted in changes
in cofilin activation and microtubule stability at these
early time points. With AMPK inhibition, there was a
corresponding increase in cofilin activation in both cell
lines, as indicated by a dose-dependent decrease in cofilin
phosphorylation (Figure 1A and 1C). Significant cofilin
activation was achieved by 2 hours in MCF-7 and 2 BT549 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A and 3B). In addition
to changes in the actin cortex, microtubule stability was
also enhanced in both cell lines. There was an increase
in glu-tubulin levels at 4 hours in MCF-7 cells and BT549 cells were slightly more sensitive with an increase
appearing by 1 hour (Figure 1B and 1D). Densitometry
revealed a significant increase in glu-tubulin in MCF-7
cells at 4 hours and by 2 hours in BT-549 cells (Figure 1E
and Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). BT-549 cells
also significantly increased tubulin acetylation by 2 hours
while MCF-7 cells had a modest increase that was not
significant (Figure 1E).
In order to visualize the effects of compound c on
microtubules, immunofluorescence was performed on both
cell lines to detect changes in detyrosinated and acetylated
alpha tubulin. MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were treated with
20 μM compound c for 4 hours and 2 hours, respectively.
Compound c slightly increased detyrosination of alphatubulin (Figure 2A), but no appreciable change was seen
in acetylated tubulin in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2B). BT-549
cells had higher basal levels of glu-tubulin, but compound
c treatment resulted in more filamentous glu-tubulin
(Supplementary Figure S4A) and also increased acetylated
tubulin (Supplementary Figure S4B). Compound c
treatment did not alter the alpha tubulin network in either
cell line. Therefore, 2 to 4 hours of AMPK inhibition
increased microtubule stability in both MCF-7 and BT549 breast cancer cells.

20 μM compound c. Cells were then harvested at varying
time points to analyze the effects of AMPK inhibition
on microtubule stability and the actin network under
suspended conditions.
Even though AMPK phosphorylation was lost over
time in suspension and the cells were able to rapidly
recover from drug treatment, compound c had a sustained
effect on the cytoskeleton in suspension. The combination
of compound c pretreatment and the initial inhibition of the
AMPK pathway at time 0 in suspension were sufficient to
maintain cofilin activation (Figure 3A and 3B). Acetylated
tubulin levels increased in MCF-7 and BT-549 cells by
15 minutes in suspension, with the biggest difference
appearing around 60 minutes. Glu-tubulin levels did not
change in either cell line in suspension with treatment
(Figure 3A and 3B). Densitometry at 60 minutes of
suspension indicated both cell lines significantly increased
cofilin activation and acetylated tubulin (Figure  3C).
Compound c treatment and suspension also did not induce
cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure S1C). Therefore,
compound c increased microtubule stability and cofilin
activity in detached human breast tumor cells.

AMPK inhibition increases microtentacles
and tumor cell re-attachment
We next wanted to determine if the alterations in
the cytoskeleton upon compound c treatment resulted in
changes in McTN formation and tumor cell re-attachment.
MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 4 hours and BT-549 cells
were pretreated for 2 hours with 20 μM compound c
and McTN counts were conducted after 15–30 minutes
in suspension. Blinded McTN quantification found
that MCF-7 and BT-549 cells treated with compound c
significantly increased McTN frequency, as compared
to cells treated with vehicle control (Figure 4A and 4C).
Representative images show the increase in McTNs in
compound c treated cells (Figure 4B and 4D).
In order to characterize the functional role of the
McTNs, we measured the re-attachment of suspended
breast tumor cells to model the early steps of CTC arrest
in distant tissues [20]. The increase in McTNs upon
compound c treatment corresponded to greater tumor cell
re-attachment (Figure 4E and 4F). Re-attachment was
increased in both cell lines with compound c treatment by
1–2 hours of suspension. Inhibiting AMPK in suspended
breast tumor cells resulted in higher McTN formation
and re-attachment, which corresponded with higher
microtubule stability and cofilin activation.

Compound c increases activated cofilin and
tubulin acetylation in suspended cells
Once the effects of compound c on attached breast
tumor cells were established, MCF-7 and BT-549 cells
were pre-treated with compound c as described above and
then suspended in drug, as an in vitro model of detached
tumor cells. Based on the cytoskeletal changes seen in
the attached cells, MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 4
hours and BT-549 cells were pretreated for 2 hours with

understand if AMPK activation could reverse the effects on

AMPK activation has been previously shown to have
therapeutic value in breast cancer cell growth in preclinical models [43]. At the dose and time point we
used, there was no cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure
S1B), but we did see similar results on cell growth at 48
hours with A-769662 treatment as previously reported
(Supplementary Figure S2C) [10].
Attached MCF-7 cells were treated with varying
doses of A-769662 for 24 hours. There was robust activation
of AMPK in MCF-7 cells at 200 μM (Figure 5A). AMPK
activation also resulted in a significant increase in cofilin
phosphorylation with 200 μM A-769662 treatment by 8
hours (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S3C). There
was no change in glu-tubulin levels, but acetylated tubulin
decreased with AMPK activation in a time-dependent
manner (Figures 5A, 5B, and Supplementary Figure S3C).
BT-549 cells activated AMPK with 400 μM A-769662 at
4 hours, which was maintained for 24 hours (Figure 5C
and 5D). Similar to MCF-7 cells, AMPK activation resulted
in increased cofilin phosphorylation with 400 μM A-769662
by 8 hours and was sustained for 24 hours. Tubulin
acetylation also decreased upon AMPK activation with 400
μM treatment by 8 hours (Figure 5D and Supplementary
Figure S3D). Densitometry at 24 hours showed a significant
decrease in cofilin activation and acetylated tubulin in
MCF-7 cells and BT-549 cells with no change in glu-tubulin
(Figure 5E).
In addition to overall protein levels, changes in
microtubule stability in MCF-7 and BT-549 cells with

A-769662 treatment were visualized with immuno­
fluorescence. There was no appreciable change in
glu-tubulin levels or organization in MCF-7 cells, which
mimicked the Western blot results (Figure 6A). MCF-7
cells slightly decreased overall acetylation with 200 μM
A-769662 for 24 hours (Figure 6B). BT-549 cells also
showed no difference in glu-tubulin (Supplementary
Figure S5A), but there was a more marked decrease in
tubulin acetylation with 400 μM A-769662 treatment for
24 hours (Supplementary Figure S5B). Alpha tubulin did
not change with treatment as a control.

Based on the changes detected in attached
cells, MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were pretreated with
200 μM and 400 μM A-769662, respectively, for
24 hours and then suspended to test the cytoskeletal
effects of A-769662 on detached breast tumor cells.
Both cell lines activated AMPK through increased
phosphorylation even though basal phosphorylation
levels did decline over time as seen previously. Similar
to the attached cells, MCF-7 cells decreased cofilin
activation with A-769662 treatment starting at 15
minutes with the biggest changes seen at 60 minutes
(Figure 7A and 7C). There were only subtle changes in
microtubule stability seen in suspended MCF-7 cells.

BT-549 cells, on the other hand, had little to no change
in cofilin activation in suspension, but did change
microtubule stability (Figure 7B). Alpha tubulin
acetylation decreased dramatically at every time point
with A-769662 treatment. Glu-tubulin levels decreased,
starting around 15–30 minutes of suspension, but did
not have as robust of a change compared to tubulin
acetylation. Densitometry revealed that MCF-7 cells
significantly decreased cofilin activation after 60
minutes of suspension, but did not alter microtubule
stability. The opposite effect was seen in BT-549
cells where there was a significant decrease in
microtubule stability at 60 minutes of suspension,
but cofilin did not change (Figure 7C). Drug
treatment and suspension did not induce cytotoxicity
(Supplementary Figure S1D).

Since AMPK activation decreased microtubule
stability in BT-549 cells and cofilin activation in
MCF-7 cells in suspension, we measured its effect on
McTN formation and re-attachment. Both MCF-7 and
BT-549 cells significantly decreased McTN frequency with
200 μM and 400 μM A-769662 treatment, respectively,
for 24 hours (Figure 8A and 8C). There was a more robust
decrease in McTN formation in BT-549 cells compared
to MCF-7 cells. Representative images show a decrease
in McTNs in a population of treated cells (Figure 8B
and 8D) compared to vehicle control. The decrease in
McTNs also corresponded with a decrease in cell reattachment in MCF-7 and BT-549 cells (Figure 8E and 8F).

in breast cancer.
Here we report that the AMPK pathway can alter
post-translational modifications on tubulin in MCF-7 and
BT-549 human breast tumor cells. AMPK inhibition with
compound c significantly increased both glu-tubulin and
acetylated tubulin in BT-549 cells and increased only
glu-tubulin in MCF-7 cells. While there are cell type
differences, both modifications indicate an increase in

compound c increased glu-tubulin levels by decreasing the
phosphorylation of a microtubule plus-end binding protein,
clip-170, in normal kidney epithelial (Vero) cells [33].
Increased expression of glu-tubulin and acetylated tubulin
are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer [25,
44] and acetylated tubulin acts as a prognostic marker in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [45]. In addition,
these markers of stable microtubules are found in the
invasive front of tumors, aid in epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT), and enhance tumor cell migration [25,
29]. Therefore, inhibiting AMPK with compound c may
raise the metastatic potential of breast tumor cells and may
not be a beneficial therapeutic strategy in some settings.
Conversely, we show that AMPK activation with
A-769662 decreased a post-translational modification
on tubulin, serving as an indicator that AMPK activation
reduces microtubule stability. When attached, treatment
of MCF-7 and BT-549 cells with A-769662 decreased
tubulin acetylation but did not change glu-tubulin. There is
currently very little known about the association of AMPK
with microtubule acetylation in breast cancer. Previous
work in HeLa cells have found that AMPK activation
in response to stress causes MEC-17 phosphorylation,
which actually hyperacetylates microtubules [46].
However, it is not known if MEC-17 is a direct substrate
of AMPK. Further, MEC-17 can be regulated by a variety
of mechanisms, including auto-acetylation, that can alter
microtubule acetylation levels [47]. It has been previously
shown that treatment of Vero cells with the AMPK
activator, AICAR, did not change glu-tubulin levels, but
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in cardiomyocytes AICAR treatment decreased glu-tubulin
[33, 48]. However, neither of these studies measured
acetylation. Based on our data and the current literature, it
is clear that AMPK is able to regulate microtubule stability
as a response to cell stress. Further research is required
to understand the mechanism by which AMPK can alter
microtubule stability using genetic mutations in AMPK
and other tubulin regulatory proteins such as MEC-17.
McTNs and tumor re-attachment are regulated not
only by the outward force of stabilized microtubules,
but also the inward contractile force of the actin cortex
[17, 19]. Here we identify, for the first time in breast
cancer, that AMPK can modulate cofilin phosphorylation.
Previous work has demonstrated that AMPK activation
with A-769662 can remodel the actin cytoskeleton in
polarized epithelial cells by phosphorylating key actin
regulatory proteins, including cofilin [32]. However,
a direct relationship between AMPK and cofilin
phosphorylation has not been established. AMPK
activation has also been shown to reduce cell motility by
inhibiting focal adhesion kinase in tumor cells and can
actually suppress metastasis in animals [49]. Here we find
that AMPK inhibition decreased cofilin phosphorylation
in both MCF-7 and BT-549 cell lines. Activation of
AMPK with A-769662 increased cofilin phosphorylation
in attached breast cancer cells, which supports work done
in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells where A-769662
treatment also raised cofilin phosphorylation [32]. The
cofilin pathway is a central player in the generation of
actin-based structures such as lamellipodia, invadopodia,

how AMPK specifically regulates cofilin phosphorylation
to improve targeting of this pathway with the goal of
reducing the invasive and metastatic phenotype of tumor
cells.
Our results show for the first time that AMPK also
plays a role in regulating the cytoskeleton of detached
breast tumor cells, which affects their McTN formation and
re-attachment ability. AMPK can play an important role
in regulating the balance of both actin and microtubules
in suspended breast tumor cells. We chose to examine
MCF-7 and BT-549 cells because of their differences
in AMPK levels and invasiveness so it is predicted that
their cytoskeleton would also have distinctive responses
to AMPK-directed drugs. Though the two cell lines
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mostly responded similarly to drug treatments, they
did show slight differences in sensitivity to each drug.
AMPK activation with A-769662 in suspended conditions
caused the most cell-line specific changes as MCF7 cells decreased cofilin activation, but BT-549 cells
responded to AMPK activation by decreasing microtubule
stability. Ultimately AMPK activation reduced McTN
frequency in both cell lines and diminished their ability to
re-attach. It has previously been established that increased
cofilin activity leads to enhanced McTN formation and
re-attachment, supporting our current data [24]. The reattachment process is a key early step for CTC retention
at a distant site [16]. Therefore, our data shows that
AMPK activation may lower the metastatic efficiency of
circulating breast tumor cells through its regulation of the
cytoskeleton.

AMPK activation has already shown great promise
in treating primary breast cancer in pre-clinical models
[14]. However, debate still remains in the field on the
therapeutic benefit of AMPK in cancer [54]. While
AMPK’s adaptive response to cell stress in cancer may
provide a survival benefit to tumor cells and allow them to
withstand states of decreased nutrient availability [55–57],
many studies have suggested that the LKB1-AMPK axis
has tumor suppressor properties [11, 43]. LKB1 is the
upstream kinase that phosphorylates AMPK and is a tumor
suppressor that is mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
(PJS) [58]. Patients with PJS have a 54% increased risk
in developing breast cancer [59] and LKB1 is mutated
in 30% of sporadic breast cancer [42]. AMPK is also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

known to inhibit cell growth by regulating p53 and other
cell cycle proteins [9, 42, 54, 59]. In addition, AMPK
activators such metformin and A-769662 inhibit tumor
growth in xenograft models and induce growth arrest
in vitro [7, 11, 42].
In particular, ECM-detached epithelial cells are
known to be metabolically compromised because of
their inability to take up glucose and produce ATP at
the same rate [60]. ECM-detached immortalized normal
breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A, activate AMPK upon
detachment [61]. While normal epithelial cells undergo
programmed cell death in these conditions [60, 62], we and
others have found that suspended breast tumor cells also
activate AMPK when detached [61] and have enhanced
36302

survival in suspension compared to MCF-10A cells [61,
63] . Unique to this study, we focused on early time points
after tumor cell suspension to model the particular step
of re-attachment in the metastatic cascade. Most other
work has focused on 24 to 48 hours of suspension of
breast epithelial or tumor cells to assay survival. However,
CTCs are able to actively adhere to the vasculature within
a much shorter timeframe than 24 hours of dissemination
into the circulation [16]. During this time, adhesion of
tumor cells with other cells can contribute to survival
in the circulation [20]. McTNs promote heterotypic and
homotypic cell-cell aggregation which may protect CTCs
while they are in transit [20, 23, 24, 64]. Permanent arrest
at a distant organ requires adhesive interactions of tumor
cells with the endothelium, which can also be facilitated
by McTNs on the surface of tumor cells [16]. By showing
that AMPK activation significantly decreases McTN
formation and re-attachment of breast tumor cells, we
report a novel role for AMPK during the early stage of
metastatic dissemination.
Though an abundance of work exists on understanding
AMPK signaling in primary tumor growth and progression,
the role of AMPK in metastasis is still unclear. The main
function of AMPK activation in a cell is to revert to a state
of increased catabolism and decreased anabolism to return
the cell to homeostasis [5, 6]. Therefore, pathways such as
protein synthesis are mostly turned off. This study offers
new insight on AMPK’s role in breast tumor cell biology
through regulation of the cytoskeleton. Elevating and/
or sustaining AMPK activation by treating cells with an
AMPK activator could have global consequences for the
cell’s cytoskeleton that may reduce McTN formation to
conserve energy. We show for the first time in breast cancer
that AMPK activation can destabilize microtubules while
strengthening the actin network by inhibiting cofilin. These
molecular changes result in a decrease in the formation of
McTNs in suspended breast tumor cells that attenuate their
ability to re-attach. In this manner, we can take advantage
of current AMPK activators that are already available or
in clinical development to increase the survival of patients
with breast cancer by decreasing the metastatic potential of
detached breast tumor cells.

Western blot analysis
MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were treated with 20
μM compound c in serum-free media for 1 hr, 2 hrs,
and 4 hrs. MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were also treated at
different concentrations of compound c and harvested
at 4 and 2 hours, respectively. MCF-7 and BT-549 cells
were treated in full-serum media with 200 μM and 400
μM of A-769662, respectively, for 4 hrs, 8 hrs, and 24
hrs. MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were treated at different
concentrations of A-769662 and harvested after 24 hours.
Attached cells were harvested using ice cold RIPA buffer
(EMD Millipore) with 1 mM PMSF, phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (EMD Millipore), and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were detached using a cell lifter
(Corning) or trypsin and transferred to a low-attach plate
(Corning) and harvested after 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes
in suspension. Cells were collected and spun at 2,000
rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet was washed with PBS and
then resuspended in RIPA buffer. Protein concentration
was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal
amounts of lysate were heated with 4x SDS sample buffer
containing 0.1 mM DTT. Protein samples were loaded
on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies).
Gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5%
(w/v) milk in tris-buffered saline pH 7.4 with 0.5% tween
(TBS-T) or 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
TBS-T for phospho-specific antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature (RT). All antibodies were used at a 1:1000
dilution in 2.5% (w/v) milk in TBS-T or 5% BSA in
TBS-T for phospho-specific antibodies and incubated
overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies: Detyrosinated alpha
tubulin (Abcam), PARP-1 (Santa Cruz), alpha-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich), and the following from Cell Signaling
Technologies: Acetylated tubulin lysine 40, pAMPK T172,
AMPK, pCofilin S3, and Cofilin. Secondary anti-mouse
and anti-rabbit IgG horse radish peroxidase was used
at 1:10,000 and 1:5,000 dilution, respectively (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Signal was detected
using Amersham ECL prime western blotting detection
reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Densitometry was
performed using ImageJ (NIH) and statistical significance
was determined using student’s t-test comparing treated
and vehicle control groups from at least three independent
experiments

McTN scoring
MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were treated with 20
μM compound c in serum-free media for 4 and 2 hours,
respectively. MCF-7 and BT-549 cells were treated with
200 μM and 400 μM A-769662, respectively, for 24
hours. Cells were stained with CellMask Orange (1:5,000;
Life Technologies) in PBS for 5 minutes at 37°C. Cells
were detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Corning) and
resuspended in DMEM without phenol-red or serum
with corresponding dose of drug and transferred to a
low-attach plate (Corning). McTNs were scored blindly
in a population of 100 cells/well as previously described
[22]. McTNs were imaged after CellMask Orange
staining using the Nikon A1R confocal microscope and
a maximum z-projection was generated. Images were
then inverted using ImageJ. Statistical significance was
determined using student’s t-test comparing McTN
frequency in treated and vehicle control groups from three
independent experiments.
