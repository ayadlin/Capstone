ABSTRACT
Here we showed that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with high
metastatic potential had low levels of NDRG2. The iron chelator Dp44mT up-regulated
NDRG2, suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibited tumor
metastasis in HCC having high metastatic potential. Also Dp44mT attenuated the
TGF-β1-induced EMT in HCC having low metastatic potential. In agreement, silencing
endogenous NDRG2 with shNDRG2 in HCC cells attenuated the effect of Dp44mT.
We showed that the NDRG2/gp130/STAT3 pathway can mediate Dp44mT effects. In
agreement, we found that a combination of NDRG2 expression and p-STAT3 levels
is a strong predictor of prognosis in HCC patients. We suggest that up-regulation of
NDRG2 by Dp44mT is a promising therapeutic approach in HCC. 

INTRODUCTION

uptake of iron.[5] Several studies showed excess iron
has carcinogenicity, and iron reduction could prevent
carcinogenesis in a supposedly normal population.[610] However, the precise molecular pathways involved
remain unclear and are important to elucidate particularly
in terms of the mechanisms involved in metastasis, which
is a major problem in cancer treatment.
Iron chelators are a relatively new class of potential
anti-metabolites that show marked and selective antitumor activity,[5, 11] although their molecular targets and
mechanisms of action remain to be completely elucidated.
To date, the most widely used chelator in clinical settings
for the treatment of iron overload is desferrioxamine
(DFO), and its antiproliferative activity against
neuroblastoma and leukemia has been examined in clinical
trials.[5] However, the use of DFO as an anticancer agent
is limited by its modest antiproliferative activity that is
related to its poor membrane permeability and short
half-life.[12, 13] In contrast, novel thiosemicarbazone

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third
leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and the second
in China.[1] Although resection is considered as a
potentially curative treatment for HCC patients, the fiveyear postoperative survival rate is 30% to 40%.[2] The
extremely poor prognosis of patients with HCC is largely
due to the high frequency of tumor recurrence or distant
metastasis.[3, 4] However, the molecular mechanism
underlying HCC metastasis remains unclear. Therefore,
the identification of novel anticancer drugs and molecular
markers will provide new opportunities for the prevention
of HCC recurrence and metastasis.
Iron is essential for both normal and cancer cells.
It is required by many proteins involved in cell growth
and proliferation. Neoplastic cells have an increased
requirement for iron as shown by their markedly elevated
expression of the transferrin receptor 1 and enhanced

chelators, such as di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), demonstrated far greater
antiproliferative activity and Fe chelation efficacy
than DFO and showed promise as an antitumor agent.
[14, 15] This chelator belongs to the di-2-pyridyl
thiosemicarbazone (DpT) group, which shows high
affinity and selectivity for Fe(III).[15]
NDRG2 belongs to the NDRG (N-myc downstreamregulated genes) family where it has been reported to
function as a tumor and metastasis suppressor gene.[1618] NDRG2 (mRNA and protein) has been described
to be significantly downregulated in a variety of human
cancer cell lines and primary tumors. NDRG2 promoter
CpG island methylation and down-regulation have been
observed in breast,[19] colon,[20] and lung cancer cell
lines[19] as well as primary glioblastomas[21] and
meningiomas,[22] liver,[23] and colorectal cancer (CRC).
[20] Hence, NDRG2 will be a promising molecular target
for cancer therapy that could be modulated by novel iron
chelators. However, the detailed mechanisms for the anticancer effects of NDRG2 are not well elucidated and
further investigation is required.
In this study, we extensively investigated the
function of Dp44mT and determined its contribution to
inhibiting HCC invasion and metastasis. We also dissected
the molecular mechanisms by which Dp44mT mediates
tumor metastasis. Results presented here suggested that
Dp44mT inhibits HCC aggression via up-regulation of
NDRG2. NDRG2 inhibits HCC metastasis via modulation
of gp130/STAT3 signaling. We propose that combination
of NDRG2 and STAT3 is a new powerful predictor for
HCC recurrence and metastasis and a new potential target
for adjuvant treatment of aggressive HCCs after surgical
resection.

showed that NDRG2 expression was significantly lower
in invasive HCC samples than in normal liver tissue or
noninvasive HCC tumors (Fig. 1D). Immunoblotting of
protein extracted from the same set of patients’ samples
confirmed the association of NDRG2 down-regulation
with features of tumor metastasis (Fig. 1E; Supporting
Information Fig. 1A), suggesting NDRG2 involvement in
HCC aggressiveness. Intriguingly, Table 1 also showed the
NDRG2 expression levels were found to be significantly
lower in HCCs with microvascular invasion (P < 0.0001),
TNM stage (II-III) (P = 0.033), Edmonson grade (III-IV)
(P = 0.018) and infiltrative growth pattern (P = 0.045).

Dp44mT inhibits the invasive potential of HCC
cells in vitro
To determine the function of Dp44mT, we treated
HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H with Dp44mT. Dp44mT
significantly inhibited their invasive capacity by 2.5and 2.3-fold, as compared with DMSO-treated cells, and
enhanced the expression of NDRG2 (Fig. 2A; Supporting
Information Fig. 2A). Dp44mT also inhibited HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H’s adhesion to several cell matrix
proteins (Fig. 2B; Supporting Information Fig. 2B).
In contrast, lentivirus mediated silencing endogenous
NDRG2 in HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H cells attenuated
the Dp44mT-induced inhibition of invasion (Fig.
2A; Supporting Information Fig. 2A), and resulted in
promotion of adhesion to cell matrix proteins (Fig. 2B;
Supporting Information Fig. 2B). In order to determine the
significance of NDRG2, retrovirus mediated transfection
of human NDRG2 into HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H cells
was performed. NDRG2 overexpression also inhibited
their invasive capacity (Fig. 2A; Supporting Information
Fig. 2A). Supporting Information Figure 1B showed
the expression of Flag and NDRG2 after transfection.
Evidently, Dp44mT acted to inhibit the invasive property
of HCC cells via up-regulation of NDRG2 in vitro.

RESULTS
Low expression of NDRG2 in HCC cell lines
with metastatic potential and in invasive HCC
specimens

Dp44mT inhibits metastasis of HCC in vivo
We further examined the effect of Dp44mT on
HCC pulmonary metastasis by establishing an orthotopic
liver tumor model in nude mice. HCC-LM3 cells having
high metastatic potential were used for orthotopic
model studies. Compared to DMSO groups, Dp44mT
treatment resulted in significant decrease of the number
of pulmonary metastatic foci and average size of
pulmonary metastatic lesions (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the
orthotopic liver tumor model based on high-metastatic
potential MHCC-97H cells also showed that NDRG2
overexpression inhibited lung metastasis (Supporting
Information Fig. 2C). On the contrary, down-regulation
of NDRG2 expression by shNDRG2 attenuated the effect
of Dp44mT-induced reduction of pulmonary metastases

We first examined the NDRG2 protein amounts
in several HCC cell lines, with varying metastatic
capability.[24, 25] The NDRG2 protein levels decreased
progressively from normal liver cells (HL-7702 and QSG7701), low metastatic SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97L cells,
to highly metastatic MHCC-97H and HCC-LM3 cells
(Fig. 1A). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis showed the same pattern of NDRG2 mRNA level
(Fig. 1B). Cell invasion assay was performed in the HCC
cell lines mentioned above (Fig. 1C). Low expression of
NDRG2 was significantly associated with higher invasive
capacity of MHCC-97H and HCC-LM3 cells as compared
with the other four HCC cell lines. Real-time PCR analysis

E-cadherin, cytokeratin-8, cytokeratin-17, cytokeratin-18,
claudin-1, and claudin-8 were higher in the Dp44mT group
than that in the DMSO group, whereas the mesenchymal
markers such as N-cadherin, vimentin, Jagged 1, Jagged
2, Goosecoid, and the EMT major regulator TWIST1 were
decreased (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting also detected higher
expression of E-cadherin in HCC-LM3 and MHCC97H cells which treated with Dp44mT. In contrast, the
expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and TWIST1
decreased in Dp44mT treated HCC-LM3 and MHCC97H cells (Fig. 3B). Gelatin zymography assay showed
that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) activity was

decreased in Dp44mT treated HCC-LM3 and MHCC97H cells (Fig. 3B). NDRG2 overexpression in HCC cells
had similar effect with Dp44mT treatment, and downregulation of NDRG2 expression by shNDRG2 abrogated
the effect of Dp44mT-induced reduction of EMT(Fig. 3B).
Immunofluorescence also showed Dp44mT and NDRG2
overexpression can increase the expression of E-cadherin,
decrease the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin in
HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H cells, shNDRG2 can abrogate
the effect of Dp44mT (Fig. 3C, Supporting Information
Fig. 3A and 4). We next investigated the occurrence of
EMT in vivo. As analyzed by immunohistochemistry,
in HCC-LM3 tumors, Dp44mT treatment exhibited
the inhibition of typical EMT phenotype, including
focal increment of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and
concurrent loss of the mesenchymal marker vimentin
and N-cadherin. And shNDRG2 can abrogate the effect
of Dp44mT (Fig. 3D). In MHCC-97H tumors, NDRG2
overexpression had similar effect with Dp44mT treatment
(Supporting Information Fig. 3B).

in advanced cancers including HCC.[26-28] We therefore
examined whether Dp44mT could act against the
TGF-β1- induced EMT in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721
cells. TGF-β1 and shNDRG2 significantly enhanced
their invasive capacity, and Dp44mT and NDRG2
overexpression attenuated the TGF-β1-induced promotion
of invasion in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig.
4A). As shown by immunoblotting studies in Figure 4B,
TGF-β1 markedly reduced E-cadherin levels in both
MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells. And NDRG2 knockdown mimics the TGF-β1-induced EMT in both MHCC97L and SMMC-7721 cells. However, after Dp44mT
treatment, the TGF-β1-induced reduction of E-cadherin
was clearly attenuated. In agreement with the ability of
Dp44mT to attenuate the TGF-β1-induced reduction
of E-cadherin, Dp44mT also significantly decreased
the TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of the N-cadherin
and vimentin, in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells.
Similarly, NDRG2 overexpression can attenuate the TGFβ1-induced EMT in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells.
Supporting Information Figure 1C showed the expression
of Flag and NDRG2 after transfection.
To demonstrate the importance of iron-depletion on
the ability of Dp44mT to inhibit the TGF-β1-induced EMT,
we further confirmed the phenomenon by co-incubating
Dp44mT with iron (as FeCl3) to form iron complexes that
cannot bind cellular iron. These complexes prevented the

iron depletion-mediated up-regulation of NDRG2, but also
inhibited the ability of Dp44mT to attenuate the TGF-β1induced EMT, as shown by the analysis of E-cadherin,
N-cadherin and vimentin expression (Fig. 4C). Together,
these data demonstrated that Dp44mT can block the TGFβ1-induced EMT in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells
and that this is dependent on chelation of cellular iron.

Next, we investigated the expression of Snail/Slug/
pSMAD3, which were responsible for the regulation of
E-cadherin. For Snail, Slug and pSMAD3, they were
significantly increased after TGF-β1 or shNDRG2
treatment (Fig. 4D). Dp44mT or NDRG2 overexpression
can attenuate the effect of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4D). Hence,
Dp44mT or NDRG2 overexpression can repress the

24 h led to a significant reduction in gp130 expression
as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 although total
STAT3 was unaffected. On the other hand, Dp44mT also
caused decrease in p-ERK1/2 expression. While NDRG2
overexpressed in HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H cells, the
expression of gp130, p-STAT3 and p-ERK1/2 was also
observed to be significantly decreased (Fig. 5A). Next, we
examined whether Dp44mT could inhibit IL-6-induced
STAT3 phosphorylation in MHCC-97L and SMMC7721 cell lines. MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells were
pretreated with Dp44mT for 24 h and then stimulated with
IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 15 min. As shown in Figure 5C, IL-6

Importantly, Dp44mT also can inhibit exogenous IL-6induced invasion in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cell

cells.

to using NDRG2 or p-STAT3 alone (Fig. 5D; Supporting
Information Fig. 5A-B). In conclusion, evaluation of both
NDRG2 expression and p-STAT3 signal is a powerful
predictor of poor prognosis, further supporting loss of
NDRG2 activated gp130/STAT3 signaling, resulting in
EMT occurrence and thus metastases of HCC cells.

Combination of NDRG2 and p-STAT3 levels has
better prognostic value for HCC

DISCUSSION
HCC is the most common liver malignancy and a
major health problem globally. Current standard practices
for treatment of HCC, surgical resection, and liver
transplantation are less than satisfactory due to metastasis
and high recurrence rates.[29] Previous studies showed
that iron homeostasis and iron regulatory pathways are
abnormal in human HCC.[30-32] Thus, it is likely that
iron chelators targeting excess iron may suppress HCC
and bring clinical benefits to HCC patients. Some studies
demonstrated that iron chelators are effective in HCC
treatment.[33, 34] However, studies of the anti-metastasis
of iron chelators for HCC have not been reported in either
preclinical or clinical studies. In this study, we focused on

We further analyzed the expression levels of
NDRG2 and p-STAT3 in clinical HCC samples through
immunohistochemistry analysis. We analyzed 136
patient specimens. The results revealed patients whose
tumors expressed below-average level of NDRG2 or
above-average level of p-STAT3 exhibited significantly
decreased trend in OS due to HCC-related death
(Supporting Information Fig. 5A-B). For patients whose
tumors had both below-average level of NDRG2 and
above-average level of p-STAT3, adverse outcomes were
exacerbated (Fig. 5D). Using the combination of these two
parameters increased the prognostic value, as compared

the anti-metastatic potency against HCC of iron chelators.
It has been well documented that a number of
cancers can be inhibited by iron chelators, particularly
solid tumors, both in vitro and in vivo, where the agent has
shown marked and selective efficacy with little toxicity
to normal cells and tissues.[14, 15, 35] In this study, we
demonstrated Dp44mT, a novel iron chelator, showed
efficient anti-metastasis effect on human HCC, both in
vitro and in vivo. The effect of Dp44mT on inhibiting the
metastasis of HCC was attributed to its ability to markedly
up-regulate NDRG2, a well-known anti-metastatic
gene.[23, 36] The NDRG2 content was high in normal
hepatocytes, decreased in noninvasive and primary HCC
cells, and reached the lowest level in invasive HCC cells.
This progressively decreased expression profile paralleled
with deterioration of the disease, suggesting a role of
NDRG2 in progression of HCC.
The effect of Dp44mT on HCC invasion and
metastasis was directly demonstrated in our in vitro
and in vivo studies. In orthotopic xenografts, Dp44mT
group generated fewer lung metastasis foci, indicating
Dp44mT inhibited aggressive and metastatic properties of
HCC. Moreover, up-regulation of NDRG2 led to severe
suppression of lung metastasis of HCC in mice. To our
knowledge, this is the first report that NDRG2 is critical
for Dp44mT to inhibit HCC metastasis, in addition to
suppress tumor proliferation and growth.
In HCC, tumor cells grow embedded in a
microenvironment with a high content of extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins, such as laminin, collagen,
vitronectin and fibronectin, as a consequence of the
development of cirrhosis.[37] Therefore, crossing the
ECM barriers by tumor cells is regarded to be particularly
important for metastatic progression of HCC. Among the
many different categories of molecules regulating tumor
metastasis, we focused on the effect of Dp44mT on the
expression of the genes responsible for tumor invasion
such as EMT regulators and ECM-degrading enzymes.
Membrane E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin are
important hallmarks of the EMT. Gelatinases (MMP2)
are important players of tumor invasion that degrade
ECM components and activate the latent TGF-β1 present
in extracellular space.[18, 38] We demonstrated that
incubation of HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H cells with
Dp44mT led to the accumulation of E-cadherin and loss
of N-cadherin and vimentin. We also found that Dp44mT
can antagonize the tumor invasion and by abrogating the
induction of gelatinase activity (MMP2).
We further demonstrated that incubation of MHCC97L and SMMC7721 cells with TGF-β1 led to the
reduction of E-cadherin and accumulation of N-cadherin
and vimentin, which was consistent with the EMT. We
further showed that Dp44mT could inhibit the TGF-β1induced reduction of E-cadherin at the membrane and
that this could be mediated by NDRG2. Indeed, NDRG2
overexpression could maintain membrane localization
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of E-cadherin, and incubation with iron chelators led
to the same result. Conversely, NDRG2 knock-down
caused a loss of membrane E-cadherin with some nuclear
translocation in MHCC-97L and SMMC-7721 cells.
And NDRG2 overexpression or Dp44mT also inhibited
the TGF-β/SMAD pathway, which can activate the EMT
in cancer cells. So our results suggested that NDRG2
may play important roles in Dp44mT antagonized the
invasion-promoting activity of TGF-β1 during metastasis.
We propose that these results might apply to a number of
additional cancer types other than HCC because NDRG2
is frequently downregulated in many other cancer types
as well.[19-23]
A increase in gp130 signal and activation of STAT3
is a key tumor survival mechanism, and promotes tumor
metastatic processes including EMT and resistance to
apoptosis.[39, 40] Previous studies have demonstrated
that activated STAT3 plays a critical role in hematogenous
intrahepatic metastasis in an orthotopic implantation
model of HCC.[41]
Our current in vitro and in vivo studies suggested
that NDRG2/gp130/STAT3 signal way was responsible
for Dp44mT-mediated inhibition of invasion/metastasis.
Furthermore, we found that NDRG2 decreased the
expression of gp130 and negatively regulated the
activation of STAT3. Given complex p-STAT3 pathways,
whether other upstream regulators are involved in
Dp44mT-inhibiting p-STAT3 signal remains to be further
determined. Remarkably, the predictive range of NDRG2
expression levels combined with p-STAT3 signal was
more sensitive than that of NDRG2 alone for OS, strongly
suggesting that the concerted activities of NDRG2 and
p-STAT3 detected in our experiments are recapitulated
in clinical patients with HCC. Combined evaluation of
NDRG2/p-STAT3 level as a new prognostic marker in
patients with HCC is important because they provide not
only a new criterion for prognosis, but also a potential
therapeutic target.
In summary, we have demonstrated that Dp44mT
mediates multiple facets essential for HCC development
and metastasis. In particular, the data has led us to propose
that combination of NDRG2 with p-STAT3 is a novel
marker in the prognosis of HCC and a potential therapeutic
target. Because NDRG2 is also decreased in other types of
cancers,[19-23] we believe that Dp44mT can be widely
used in human cancers to inhibit proliferation and prevent
metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and samples
136 patients were randomly retrieved from HCC
patients who underwent curative resection in The First
8486

Oncotarget

Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (Harbin,
China) from March 2007 to July 2010. The detailed
clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients are
listed in Table 1.These HCC patients were monitored
after surgery, until September, 2013. All specimens were
collected immediately after resection, and fixed in 10%
formalin. None of the patients received any preoperative
anticancer treatment. Curative resection was defined
as: (i) the complete resection of all tumor nodules and
the cut surface being free from cancer on histological
examination; (ii) no cancerous thrombus found in the
portal vein (main trunk or two major branches), hepatic
veins or bile duct; (iii) no extrahepatic metastasis and
(iv) negative serology and imaging studies at 2 months
after operation. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the
interval between the dates of surgery and death.
In addition, 15 normal liver (which were obtained
from patients with hemangiomas of liver who underwent
surgery), 15 non-invasive HCC (without vascular
invasion) and 15 invasive HCC (with vascular invasion)
fresh samples were also obtained from The First Affiliated
Hospital of Harbin Medical University. Patient samples
were obtained following informed consent according to an
established protocol approved by the Ethic Committee of
The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University.

line GP2-293T was cotransfected with pCMV-VSVG,
and one of either pLPCX-Control or pLPCX-NDRG2Flag, using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche
Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). To generate
lentivirus, the packaging line 293T was cotransfected with
psPAX2, pMD2.G and one of either pGIPZ-shControl
or pGIPZ-shNDRG2, using FuGENE 6 Transfection
Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN).
Retrovirus- or lentivirus-containing conditioned medium
was harvested, filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane,
and used to transduce HCC cells according to standard
procedures. Following retroviral or lentiviral infection,
single-cell clonal isolates were selected in the presence of
puromycin for 2 to 4 weeks.

Immunoblot analysis
For preparing total cell lysates, cells were lysed
in lysis buffer (Invitrogen), incubated on ice for 30
min and centrifuged for 20 min to remove cell debris.
Total cell lysate was subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) and incubated overnight with
antibodies at 4°C. Subsequently, the membranes were
incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature and the signal was detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
The primary antibodies: NDRG2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin
and vimentin were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
MA). TWIST1 and gp-130 were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas). STAT3, p-STAT3
(Tyr705), ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Flag and
β-actin was purchased from Sigma. The secondary
antibodies, anti-mouse IgG-HRP and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell lines and cell treatments
Normal liver cell lines HL-7702, QSG-7701 and
liver cancer cell lines SMMC-7721, MHCC-97L, MHCC97H and HCC-LM3 were purchased from Cell Bank of
Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy
of Sciences. Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a
humidified incubator containing 5% CO2, in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco, Invitrogen Company,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).
provider. Human recombinant TGF-β1 was obtained
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at a
final concentration of 5 ng/ml. The cells were incubated
in serum-free medium overnight, and then treated with
TGF-β1 for 48 h. Dp44mT and IL-6 were purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The chelator Dp44mT was utilized
at a low concentration since this ligand shows far higher
membrane permeability and demonstrates marked iron
chelation efficacy.[15] Dp44mT was freshly dissolved
in DMSO (Sigma) and diluted in culture media (final
[DMSO]: ≤ 0.1% (v/v)).

permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at
room temperature. The cells were then incubated overnight
with primary antibodies at 4 °C, followed by incubation
with fluorescent secondary antibody (invitrogen) for 1
hour at room temperature. After final washes with PBS,
the coverslips were mounted using an anti-fade mounting
solution containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Vector lab, Burlingame, CA) and images were examined
and captured.

Immunohistochemistry was performed as described
previously[42] using NDRG2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin
and vimentin antibodies. In brief, tissue sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with ethanol.
Tissue sections were then preincubated with 10% normal
goat serum in PBS (pH 7.5) followed with incubation with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Tissue sections were
then stained with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector
lab) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by the
Vectastain Elite ABC reagent (Vector lab) for 30 min. The
peroxidase reaction was developed with diaminobenzidine
(DAB kit; Vector lab) and the slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin (Sigma).

Cell invasion and adhension assays
Invasion was measured by using 24-well BioCoat
cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences, NJ) with an 8 μm–
porosity polyethylene terephthalate membrane coated with
Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix. For adhesion assay,
we used the CytoSelectTM Cell Adhesion Assay Kit (Cell
Biolabs, San Diego, CA). The adherent cells are extracted
and measured the OD 560nm in a plate reader.

Nude mice xenograft and orthotopic model studies
All animal experiments met the requirement of
Harbin Medical University Animal Care Facility and the
National Institutes of Health guidelines. For assessment
the effect of Dp44mT in orthotopic tumor xenografts, an
orthotopic liver tumor model in nude mice with higher
potential of distant (lung) metastases was established.
Briefly, we infected HCC-LM3 cells with lentiviralshNDRG2 or lentiviral-shCtrl. And we infected MHCC97H cells with retrovial-NDRG2 or retrovial-Ctrl. Then
these approximately 1×107 infected or mock cells in 0.2
ml culture medium phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the
mice, which were then observed daily for signs of tumor
development. Once the subcutaneous tumor reached 1-1.5
cm in diameter, it was removed and cut into about 1-2
mm3 cubes which were implanted into the left liver lobe
of another group of nude mice. A week later, the nude
mice were treated with Dp44mT (0.4 mg/kg). Dp44mT
was dissolved in 30% propylene glycol in 0.9% saline
and injected intravenously (via the tail vein) 5 days/

Quantitative Taqman real-time PCR
Total RNA from cells or human tissues were
prepared with RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA
was prepared by using TaqMan® Reverse Transcription
Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY).
Human NDRG2 probe and β-actin probe were purchased
from Applied Biosystems. Taqman real-time PCR was
done with TaqMan PCR mixture (Applied Biosystems).
The other genes were analyzed using SYBR Green PCR
mixture (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences are
