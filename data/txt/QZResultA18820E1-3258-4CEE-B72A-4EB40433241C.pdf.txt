ABSTRACT
Anaplastic (ATC) and refractory papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) lack effective
treatments. Inhibition of either oncogenic BRAF or SRC has marked anti-tumor effects
in mouse models of thyroid cancer, however, neither drug induces notable apoptosis.
Here we report that the SRC-inhibitor dasatinib further sensitizes BRAFV600E-positive
thyroid cancer cells to the BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4720. Combined treatment with
PLX4720 and dasatinib synergistically inhibited proliferation and reduced migration
in PTC and ATC cells. Whereas PLX4720 did not induce robust apoptosis in thyroid
cancer cells, combined treatment with dasatinib induced apoptosis in 4 of 6 lines.
In an immunocompetent orthotopic mouse model of ATC, combined PLX4720 and
dasatinib treatment significantly reduced tumor volume relative to PLX4720 treatment
alone. Immune cell infiltration was increased by PLX4720 treatment and this effect
was maintained in mice treated with both PLX4720 and dasatinib. Further, combined
treatment significantly increased caspase 3 cleavage in vivo relative to control or
either treatment alone. In conclusion, combined PLX4720 and dasatinib treatment
induces apoptosis, increases immune cell infiltration and reduces tumor volume in
a preclinical model of ATC, suggesting that the combination of these FDA-approved
drugs may have potential for the treatment of patients with ATC or refractory PTC.

INTRODUCTION

that BRAFV600E plays an important role in the aggressive
behavior of thyroid cancer cells in vitro and that treatment
with the selective BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4720 results
in impressive decreases in tumor volume and metastasis
in an orthotopic mouse model of ATC [5-8, 10]. These
findings, combined with data from others, led to a
phase II clinical trial (NCT01286753) to evaluate the
selective BRAFV600E-inhibitor vemurafenib in patients
with progressive RAI-refractory BRAFV600E-positive
PTC. Vemurafenib treatment elicited partial responses
in a subset of patients. The overall clinical benefit at 6
months was 58% in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naïve
patients and treatment extended progression free survival
to 15.6 months [11]. Additionally, in a separate case, a
patient with ATC exhibited a response to treatment with

While traditional treatments of papillary thyroid
cancer (PTC), including thyroidectomy, thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, and radioactive
iodine (RAI) are highly effective at mitigating disease,
patients with advanced PTC or undifferentiated
(anaplastic) thyroid cancer (ATC) face poor prognosis
and need novel therapeutics. Approximately 45% of PTC
and dedifferentiated PTC patients have an activating
mutation at amino acid 600 of BRAF (BRAFV600E) [1,
2]. To improve outcomes for patients with BRAFV600Epositive advanced PTC and ATC, efforts have been
focused on inhibiting oncogenic BRAF signaling with
targeted therapeutics [1, 3-9]. We have previously shown

A number of SRC-inhibitors have been developed,
including dasatinib (BMS-354825), a multikinase inhibitor
that is primarily appreciated as a dual SRC- and ABLfamily inhibitor [24, 33]. It is FDA-approved for patients
with chronic myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and is being pursued for patients with solid
tumors [23, 27, 34-42]. In spite of many intriguing
preclinical findings, SRC-inhibitors have thus far shown
limited clinical effectiveness when used as a single agent
for solid tumors [30]. More recently, several groups have
demonstrated that dasatinib treatment reduces tumor
growth and inhibits metastasis in various mouse models
of BRAFWT and BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer [23,
27, 31]. SRC signaling has been implicated in both PTC
and ATC with increased expression of pathway members
correlating with disease progression, metastatic potential
and invasion [23-26, 28, 40, 43-47]. Further, evidence
from melanoma, including new data from an unbiased
screen for genes conferring resistance to mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibition, suggests
that SRC and related Src family kinases play a role in
resistance to BRAFV600E-inhibition [32, 48]. We believe
there is potential to use SRC-inhibitors in combination
with BRAFV600E-inhibitors to treat advanced PTC and
ATC.
Our study examines the response of genetically
defined murine PTC and ATC cell lines to PLX4720,
dasatinib and a combination of these drugs in vitro. This
approach resonates with the current vision for personalized
medicine in which rational therapeutic combinations result
in increased efficacy as well as potential for reduced side
effects. Additionally, we validate our in vitro data in an
immunocompetent orthotopic model of aggressive ATC,
permitting analysis of the host immune response to the
treatment of tumor growth in the thyroid, an aspect of
increasing importance given the potential for emerging
immunotherapies.

vemurafenib [12]. Since complete responses have not been
achieved, the results encourage further investigation using
more effective combinations to target multiple pathways
simultaneously.
While the effectiveness of BRAFV600E-inhibition in
melanoma has spurred investigation in thyroid cancer,
there are important differences between melanoma and
thyroid cancer. Nanomolar concentrations of BRAFV600Einhibitors are sufficient to inhibit proliferation in melanoma
cell lines whereas micromolar doses are required for a
similar effect in thyroid cancer cell lines [6-8, 13, 14].
Furthermore, unlike melanoma cells, thyroid cancer cells
do not undergo apoptosis when treated with BRAFV600Einhibitors suggesting the persistence of additional
signaling pathways that permit or promote survival [5,
6]. In addition, in melanoma, it appears that oncogenic
BRAF-signaling may cloak immune antigens present on
the cancer cells and that treating with BRAFV600E-inhibitors
promotes anti-tumor immune cell infiltration and activity
[15-21]. The potential effects of BRAFV600E-inhibitors on
the immune response have not been investigated in thyroid
cancer because all previous studies using human thyroid
cancer cells have used immunocompromised mice and
novel genetically engineered mice with BRAF tumors
rarely show aggressive behavior [22].
In an effort to enhance the efficacy of BRAFV600Einhibition in thyroid cancer, we chose to target additional
signaling pathways, chiefly SRC signaling. The Src
family of kinases consists of 9 members, with c-Src being
the most prevalent in human tumors and specifically in
thyroid cancer cells [23, 24]. The Src oncogene, recently
identified as a driver of thyroid cancer progression and
metastasis, is a compelling therapeutic target as it is
an important signaling node that modulates varied
downstream signaling including the MAPK, PI3K-AKT,
FAK, and STAT3 pathways [23, 25-31]. Activated SRC
forms a complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and,
together, these two kinases affect cell motility, invasion,
proliferation, survival, anchorage-independent growth and
drug resistance [24, 32].

RESULTS
Dasatinib effectively inhibits SRC signaling,
but not MAPK signaling, in a panel of murine
BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer cell lines
SRC signaling, as evidenced by phosphorylation
at tyrosine 416 (pSRC(Y416)), is active in a panel of
human and murine PTC and ATC thyroid cancer cell
lines harboring BRAFV600E. (Table 1, Fig. 1A). Dasatinib
treatment reduces basal SRC signaling in the murine cell
lines. Notably, while a complete reduction of pSRC(Y416)
is achieved in the murine ATC lines with a dose of 50
nM dasatinib , it is modest in the PTC line, TBP-3868,
for which 100 nM dasatinib is required to eliminate
pSRC(Y416) (Fig. 1B). Dasatinib treatment does not

appreciably effect ERK phosphorylation (pERK(T202/
Y204)) at doses lower than 100 nM (Fig. 1B).
Given that dasatinib does not reduce pERK(T202/
Y204) at 50 nM, we treated the murine cell lines with
PLX4720. Treatment of the murine ATC cell lines (TBP3743, TBPt-3403 and TBPt-3610R) with 1 µM of the
BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4720 decreases pERK(T202/
Y204), however a more complete reduction is achieved
with a dose of 10 µM. Surprisingly, The PTC line, TBP3868, exhibits a resistance to PLX4720 with pERK(T202/
Y204) persisting with doses up to 50 µM (Fig. 1C).

Combined treatment of the ATC cell lines with both
10 µM PLX4720 and 50 nM dasatinib results in a decrease
of both pERK(T202/Y204) and pSRC(Y416), whereas
only pSRC(Y416) is reduced in the PLX4720-resistant
PTC line, TBP-3868 (Fig. 1D).
Notably, phosphorylation of key signaling proteins,

lines deficient for either p53 (TBP-3868 and TBP-3743) or Pten (TBPt-3403 and TBPt-3610R) were probed with pERK(T202/Y204), total

FAK and AKT, is observed in lines treated with PLX4720.
FAK phosphorylation is induced at tyrosine 861 in all
four lines when treated with PLX4720 and combined
treatment with both PLX4720 and dasatinib either reduced
or eliminated this PLX4720-induced FAK phosphorylation
in the ATC lines tested, but not in the PLX4720-resistant
line, TBP-3868. PLX4720 induces AKT phosphorylation
at serine 473 (pAKT(S473)) in the ATC cell lines.
Interestingly, pAKT is not induced in the PLX4720resistant line TBP-3868, suggesting that the PLX4720induced increase of pAKT observed in TBP-3743 may be
dependent on a decrease in pERK. Combined treatment
with dasatinib eliminates PLX4720-induced pAKT in
TBP-3473, but not in the PTEN-deficient lines TBPt-3403
and TBPt-3610R.
The PLX4720-insenstive line, TBP-3868, exhibits
high basal Ras activity relative to the PLX4720-sensitive
line, TBP-3743 (Fig. 1E). BRAFV600E-inhibition with
PLX4720, activates Ras in the sensitive line TBP-3743.
Unlike the PLX4720-mediated activation of FAK and
AKT in TBP-3743, the induction of Ras activity is not
reduced by combined treatment with dasatinib (Fig. 1E).
Interestingly, a shorter film exposure reveals that PLX4720
induces Ras activation in the absence of a reduction of
pERK in TBP-3868.

Y204) inhibition, shows synergy with a CI value of 0.524.
A synergistic effect was observed in the ATC lines as
well with, CI values of 0.451, 0.567 and 0.069 for TBP3743, TBPt-3403 and TBPt-3403, respectively. Among
the murine lines, TBPt-3610R exhibited the lowest CI
value indicating strong synergy (Fig. 2E). Similarly, the
human lines exhibited strong synergy between PLX4720
and dasatinib with BCPAP and 8505c both exhibiting CI
values less than 0.050 (Fig. 2E).

PLX4720 has a significant but variable effect on
the migration of murine BRAFV600E anaplastic
thyroid cancer cell lines whereas dasatinib
reduces >90% of the migratory capacity of all cell
lines tested
We previously demonstrated that PLX4720
effectively inhibits the migration of the human ATC line,
8505c [6]. Here we show that the migratory capacity of the
murine ATC lines TBP-3743, TBPt-3403 and TBPt-3610R
are significantly reduced by treatment with PLX4720.
TBPt-3610R is less sensitive to PLX4720 treatment than
either TBP-3743 or TBPt-3403. While PLX4720 treatment
reduces the migration of TBP-3743 and TBPt-3403 to 22%
and 26%, respectively, the migration of TBPt-3610R is
reduced to only 63% of DMSO-treated control cells (Fig.
3A). In concordance with the demonstrated resistance
to PLX4720-mediated pERK(T202/Y204) inhibition in
TBP-3868 cells, PLX4720 treatment does not significantly
inhibit the migration of this PTC line. In contrast to the
variable anti-migratory responses evoked by PLX4720
treatment, dasatinib treatment strongly inhibits cellular
migration in each of the cell lines with the migration of
TBP-3868, TBP-3743, TBPt-3403 and TBPt-3610R being
reduced to 4%, 1%, 12% and 3%, respectively, of control
treated cells. Interestingly, treatment of the PTEN-deficient
lines, TBPt-3403 and TBPt-3610R, with a combination
of PLX4720 and dasatinib induces a further significant
reduction of migration relative to treatment with either
agent alone (Fig. 3A).

Dasatinib synergizes with PLX4720 to reduce
proliferation in PTC and ATC BRAFV600E cell lines
Dasatinib exhibited a modest anti-proliferative
effect on the murine BRAFV600E-positive cell lines. The
IC50 values were determined to be greater than 100 nM,
the upper limit of specificity, for each line (TBP-3868
= 223 nM; TBP-3743 = 238 nM; TBPt-3403 = 243 nM;
TBPt-3610R = 363 nM). Consistent with previous reports
BCPAP exhibited sensitivity (85 nM), while the human
ATC line, 8505c, showed resistance to dasatinib (1383
nM) (Fig. 2A-B) [23].
Characteristic of thyroid cancer, the murine and
human cell lines exhibited high PLX4720 IC50 values (≥
15 μM). For each cell line, however, co-treatment with
a fixed ratio of dasatinib shifted the dose response curve
and lowered the PLX4720 IC50 value. The IC50 values of
PLX4720 dropped to less than 10 μM in combination with
dasatinib (TBP-3868: 27 μM to 9 μM; TBP-3743: 15 μM
to 4 μM; TBPt-3403: 25 μM to 7; TBPt-3610R: 22 μM to
2 μM). Similarly, the IC50 value of PLX4720 dropped from
35 μM to 14 μM for 8505c and from 17 μM to 1 μM for
BCPAP when combined with dasatinib (Fig. 2C-D).
The combined effect of PLX4720 and dasatinib was
formally assessed for synergy by Chou-Talalay analysis
[49]. The combination index (CI) for each line was less
than 1.0, indicating a synergistic effect between PLX4720
and dasatinib. TBP-3868, which in spite of exhibiting
resistance to PLX4720 in terms of the pERK(T202/

Treatment with PLX4720 did not induce a significant

for any of the lines tested except for the PTEN-null ATC
line, TBP-3403, which showed a modest but significant
increase to with 8.9±1.8% expressing annexin-V, exhibited
a modest but significant increase relative to DMSO-treated
cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). The other murine lines treated

positive cells not significantly differing between DMSOand dasatinib-treated cells (Fig. 3B).
Treatment of two of the ATC lines, TBP-3743
and TBPt-3403, with a combination of dasatanib and
PLX4720 induced significantly higher percentages of
cells to undergo apoptosis relative to either drug alone.
Whereas only 8.3±0.9% of DMSO-treated TBP-3743
cells exhibited annexin-V expression, combined PLX4720
and dasatinib treatment induced 34.0±6.0% of the cells
to express annexin-V (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). Similarly, a
significant increase from 4.2±0.3% to 15.9±.07% is
observed in TBPt-3403 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
TBP-3868 and TBPt-3610R lines proved refractory to
both single agents and the combined treatment, with only
15.3±0.8% and 12.3±1.5% of cells expressing annexin-V
following treatment with a combination of PLX4720 and
dasatinib (Fig. 3B).
While neither PLX4720 nor dasatinib were
effective at inducing apoptosis in human 8505c ATC

cells (2.4±0.1%and 3.0±1.2%, respectively, compared to
2.4±0.5% in vehicle treated cells) the combined treatment
increased the amount of apoptosis to 6.3±0.3% of the
cells (p < 0.05). The human PTC line, BCPAP, has been
previously shown to be sensitive to dasatinib and while
control cells exhibited relatively high levels of annexin-V
positive cells (12.3±3.6%), treatment with PLX4720
or dasatinib increased the percentage to 24.6±6.5% and
22.7±7.2%, respectively. The combination of PLX4720
and dasatinib significantly increased the amount of
apoptosis to 48.9±10.5% (p < 0.05).
The flow cytometry findings are supported by
western blot analysis of pro-apoptotic proteins following
treatment of the murine thyroid cancer lines with PLX4720
and dasatinib. PARP cleavage and Caspase 3 cleavage are
observed in both TBP-3743 and TBPt-3403 when these
lines are treated with both PLX4720 and dasatinib (Fig.
3C).

Combined dasatinib and PLX4720 treatment
reduces tumor volume in a pre-clinical mouse
model of aggressive ATC

Fluorescence imaging indicated that the primary tumors
were GFP-positive, however luciferase live-imaging,
post necropsy GFP-imaging or gross inspection indicated
distant metastases to the lung (Fig. 4B-C and data not
shown). The average body weight of mice from both the
control and the dasatinib treated groups was significantly
lower than that of mice from either the PLX4720 or
combined treatment groups two weeks post-implantation,
following one week of treatment (Fig. 4D). Mice treated
with PLX4720, dasatinib or a combination exhibited
markedly smaller tumors than control mice two weeks
post-implantation (Fig. 4C, E, F).
In addition to palpable tumors in the neck region,
the mice implanted with TBP-3743 ATC and fed a control
diet exhibited poor body condition, a dramatic loss
of body weight and were euthanized two weeks postimplantation. These control mice developed large thyroid
tumors with a mean volume 23152 mm3. At two weeks,
mice in the dasatinib-treated group exhibited significantly
smaller tumors than the control group (123±28 mm3; p
< 0.001), however similarly presented with poor body
condition, exhibited a dramatic reduction in body weight
and were euthanized. Mice fed PLX4720-impregnated
chow exhibited tumors with a mean volume of 92±68
mm3 two weeks post-implantation, significantly lower

To investigate the efficacy of combined PLX4720
and dasatinib treatment in vivo we utilized a newly
described immunocompetent model of aggressive thyroid
cancer. In this model highly aggressive ATC cells, TBP3743, transduced with constructs expressing luciferase
and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were implanted in
the thyroids of B6129SF1/J mice as previously described,
which results in rapid tumor progression and local
invasive behavior, typically resulting in death of the
mouse approximately 14 days post-implantation. This
model allows analysis of tumor progression with luciferase
imaging and also analysis of immune cell infiltration into
the tumor (Fig. 4A) [50]. Six days following implantation,
pre-treatment luciferase activity was measured to assess
tumor take and progression. Equivalent luciferase activity
was detected in the neck region of imaged mice indicating
marked and consistent tumor growth (Fig. 4B). Gross
examination two weeks post-implantation (one week
of treatment) revealed that tumors developed to the left
side of the trachea near the site of implantation (Fig. 4C).

Figure 3: Combined treatment with PLX4720 and dasatinib reduces cellular migration and induces apoptosis in a
subset of PTC and ATC cell lines. A. PLX4720 has a significant but variable effect on the migration of murine ATC whereas dasatinib

strongly reduces the migratory capacity of all cell lines tested. Percent migration relative to DMSO-treated control cells for each murine
thyroid cancer cell line was determined following treatment for 16 hours with DMSO, 10 µM PLX4720, 50 nM dasatinib or a combination
of 10 µM PLX4720 and 50 nM Dasatinib prior to seeding into transwell migration chambers, under continuous treatment, for migration
along a serum gradient for an additional 24 hours. B. To determine percent apoptosis relative to DMSO-treated controls, annexin-V
expression was determined by FACS analysis of the cell lines treated with DMSO, 10 µM PLX4720, 50 nM dasatinib, or both 10 µM
PLX4720 and 50 nM dasatinib for 18 hours. C. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from treated cells. Membranes were probed for
Caspase 3 and PARP. Beta actin was probed to verify equal protein loading. Both the migration (conducted in duplicate) and the annexin-V
expression experiments were independently performed three times and the means are displayed with SEM. Significant differences are
denoted by p values < 0.05 as determined by Student’s t-test for the migration assays and by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple
comparison test for the annexin-V analysis.

than the control group (p < 0.01). Mice treated with the
combination of both dasatinib and PLX4720 developed
tumors with mean volumes of 62±26 mm3, significantly
smaller than the control mice (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4E, F).
Though the mean tumor volumes of the PLX4720-treated
mice and the mice receiving the combined treatment did
not significantly differ from the mean tumor volume of the

dasatinib-treated group, mice in these groups maintained
body weight and appeared healthy (Fig. 4D).
The PLX4720 and combined treatment groups
survived for an additional week before mice of the
PLX4720 treatment began to exhibit poor body condition.
The average body weight of mice from both groups began
to decline in the third week post-implantation and the mice

tumor size of the combined treatment group was 118±26
mm3, significantly lower than that the PLX4720-treated
group, which was 29450 mm3 (p < 0.0001). Notably,
the mean tumor size did not significantly change in the
combined treatment group from two weeks to three weeks
post-implantation.
Caspase 3 cleavage was largely undetectable in
tumor sections from control mice suggesting a lack of
basal apoptosis (0.9±0.35) (Fig. 5A-B). A modest, but
significant, increase in caspase 3 cleavage was observed
in PLX4720-treated mice (11.6±2.46; p < 0.01), but not
in dasatinib-treated mice (4.6±1.09; p > 0.5) two weeks
post-implantation (Fig. 5A-B). Combined treatment
resulted in a marked induction of caspase 3 cleavage in
vivo, significantly increased relative to both control and
individually treated mice (32.2±2.94; p < 0.0001) (Fig.
5A-B).

permits study of immune responses to tumor growth and
treatment. Tumor tissue obtained from mice treated with
PLX4720 featured a marked increase in the infiltration
of CD8+ T cells relative to tumor tissue obtained from
the control group (Fig. 5C). Dasatinib treatment did not
noticeably induce CD8+ T cell infiltration beyond what
was detected in the control group (Fig. 5C). Abundant
CD8+ T cell infiltration was observed in tumors obtained
from mice receiving combined treatment, however the
degree of infiltration did not markedly differ from that
observed in mice treated with PLX4720 alone.
Whereas sections obtained from TBP-3743 control
tumors two weeks post-implantation are largely devoid
of infiltrating B220+ B cells, with 2±0.7 cells per highpowered field (hpf), abundant infiltration of B220+ B
cells is observed in tumors treated with PLX4720, with
22±5.6 B220+ cells/hpf (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5C-D). Dasatinib
treatment does not induce a significant increase in B cell
infiltration relative to control (6±1.1 B220+ cells/hpf),
however tumors treated with both PLX4720 and dasatinib
feature 39±5.6 B220+ cells/hpf, significantly more than
what is observed in tumors obtained from control (p <
0.0001). The increase in B cell infiltration into tumors
treated with both PLX4720 and dasatinib is modestly, but
significantly, higher than the increase in tumors treated
with PLX4720 alone (p < 0.05).

The response of innate immune cells was assessed
by probing sections of tumor with a marker of monocytes
and macrophages, F4/80. The pattern of infiltration of
F4/80+ cells with regard to treatment was similar to the
pattern of CD8+ infiltration. Control TBP-3743 tumors
were largely devoid of F4/80+ cells whereas tumors from
PLX4720-treated mice exhibited marked infiltration.
Few F4/80+ cells are observed dasatinib-treated tumors.
Tumors obtained from mice receiving combined treatment
feature robust infiltration of F4/80+ cells, again, similar
to the response observed with PLX4720 treatment alone
(Fig. 5C).

however did not extend survival beyond that of control,
as the animals treated with dasatinib alone lost weight
and became moribund. Dasatinib is metabolized rapidly
in humans, with a plasma half-life less than four hours,
and it is possible that with appropriate dosing, perhaps
by increasing the frequency of doses, the overall efficacy
of dasatinib could be augmented [51]. Most importantly,
while PLX4720 significantly reduced tumor volume in
this model and permitted survival out to three weeks, the
combination of PLX4720 and dasatinib resulted in both
the greatest reduction in tumor volume and an increase in
apoptotic cells.
Both positives and negative aspects are associated
with the use of such an aggressive model. A shortcoming
of our in vivo model is the lack of metastatic progression,
putatively due to the rapidity of tumor growth and
mortality. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that
PLX4720 treatment effectively blocks distant metastasis
in an immunodeficient orthotopic model of ATC utilizing
the human line 8505c [6-8]. Similarly, dasatinib inhibited
distant metastasis when a human PTC line, BCPAP, was
intracardially injected [23]. It is possible that metastases
could develop in the model presented here if either fewer
cells are implanted or, alternatively, an approach involving
intracardial or tail vein injection is used [23, 50, 52]. As
executed, while metastases do not form, the model is a
stringent test for the efficacy of the treatments, as sizeable
tumors develop six days post-implantation when the drugs
are first administered [23, 50, 52].
Our experimental design permitted analysis of the
immune response to tumorigenesis and treatment. Beyond
suppressing tumor growth and inducing apoptosis, the
inhibition of oncogenic BRAF evoked an immunestimulatory effect in mice implanted with TBP-3743.
PLX4720 treatment of immunocompetent mice induced
the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, B cells and macrophages
into the TBP-3743-derived tumor. This observation is
consistent with work in melanoma that has demonstrated
that BRAFV600E-inhibition stimulates the expression of
tumor antigens, induces T cell infiltration and enhances the
efficacy of infiltrating T cells [15-21]. Dasatinib treatment
did not qualitatively induce CD8+ or macrophage
infiltration relative to control and the increase in B cell
infiltration was not significant, suggesting the increases
observed in the tumors treated with both PLX4720 and
dasatinib are largely due to PLX4720 treatment. While
BRAFV600E-inhibition has been previously shown to
increase tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, it has also been
shown to induce the expression of T cell exhaustion
markers including PD-L1, TIM3 and PD1 in melanoma
patients [53]. It will be of interest to further characterize
the T cell response to BRAFV600E-inhibition to determine
if combined treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors
will be of benefit in thyroid cancer.
Our in vivo findings built on observations in vitro
which show the combination of PLX4720 and dasatinib

DISCUSSION
Targeted inhibition of oncogenic signaling is
emerging as a viable approach for treating thyroid cancer
that is refractory to traditional therapies. As in melanoma,
the inhibition of oncogenic BRAF has been a major focus
of these efforts in thyroid cancer, however the importance
of additional pathways has been recognized. Here we
investigate the efficacy of the rational combination of
FDA-approved inhibitors of oncogenic BRAF and SRC. In
addition, our use of a novel immunocompetent orthotopic
murine model permits the analysis of the host immune
response to thyroid cancer and treatment.
Our data demonstrate that the combined treatment of
BRAF mutated thyroid cancer cells with the BRAFV600Einhibitor PLX4720 and the SRC-inhibitor dasatinib
results in a synergistic increase in the anti-proliferative
and apoptotic responses in vitro. Further, combined
treatment with these inhibitors results in a robust cytotoxic
response and decreased tumor volume in a preclinical
model of aggressive BRAFV600E-positive ATC. Tumor
shrinkage is accompanied by a dramatic host immune
response, predominantly driven by PLX4720 treatment
and important given the potential for recent innovative
immunotherapeutic approaches.
Our lab previously demonstrated that the inhibition
of oncogenic BRAF results in dramatic tumor reduction
in a model of human ATC and several other groups
have shown that dasatinib treatment effectively reduces
tumor growth in mice implanted with human BRAFV600Epositive thyroid cancer cells [6, 8, 23, 31]. Of the
murine lines examined in vitro, we selected the most
aggressive murine ATC line, TBP-3743, for implantation
and investigation in our immunocompetent model. In
addition to harboring oncogenic BRAF, TBP-3743 is p53null and rapidly forms tumors with locally aggressive
features [50]. The control animals in the current study
recapitulated our previous observations and developed
tumors that lead to dramatic weight loss and death two
weeks post-implantation. PLX4720 treatment resulted in
a significant reduction of tumor size relative to control
and extended survival beyond two weeks. Similarly,
dasatinib treatment significantly reduced tumor volume

to synergistically inhibit proliferation, reduce migration
and induce apoptosis. The combined treatment of either
murine or human lines with PLX4720 and dasatinib results
in a synergistic shifting of the dose response. Synergy is
particularly important as it may permit lower doses of
PLX4720 to be used, potentially translating to a benefit
in the clinic by reducing side effects associated with
BRAFV600E-inhibition including squamous cell carcinoma
[54-56].
Among the cell lines tested, the human ATC line
8505c exhibited resistance to dasatinib, yet synergy was
observed with combined treatment. Dasatinib has a wide
kinase profile at higher doses and in addition to SRC,
dasatinib targets a number of important protein kinases
including other SRC family kinases, ABL, KIT, EPH
receptors, EGFR, PDGFRA and MAPK proteins including
BRAF, CRAF and MEK1 [57]. High doses of dasatinib
(100 nM – 2.5 µM) reduced ERK phosphorylation in the
murine cell lines suggesting that the anti-proliferative
effect of dasatinib treatment may be due, at least in
part, to the inhibition of the MAPK pathway. 8505c
exhibits the greatest resistance to dasatinib in terms of
proliferation (IC50 = 1383 nM) and expresses low basal
SRC activity relative to the other lines tested, suggesting
that the reduced proliferation of 8505c cells treated with
high doses of dasatinib (e.g. > 1000 nM) alone may be a
result of the direct inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK1 by
dasatinib. Further this may also suggest the importance of
the higher SRC activity observed in the other lines, all of
which showed sensitivity to dasatinib at lower doses.
The inhibition of additional, non-SRC, targets
by dasatinib may be particularly relevant following
BRAFV600E-inhibition that leads to a release of negative
feedback and the consequent activation of various
signaling proteins by kinome reprogramming [13, 58,
59]. The synergy between dasatinib and PLX4720 could
potentially be a result of PLX4720-mediated MAPKinhibition coupled with dasatinib-mediated SRC-inhibition
and dasatinib-mediated inhibition of other protein kinases
activated by the loss of MAPK-mediated negative
feedback.
TBP-3868 is unique among the lines examined
in that ERK phosphorylation is maintained in spite of
PLX4720 treatment. BRAFV600E signals as a monomer and
independently of upstream Ras activity. In the context of
wildtype RAF (BRAF or CRAF) and high Ras activity,
BRAFV600E-inhibition may “paradoxically” enhance
MAPK activity [60, 61]. TBP-3868 exhibits high basal Ras
activity relative to the PLX4720 sensitive line, TBP-3743
suggesting that the resistance to BRAFV600E-inhibition
in TBP-3868 may be attributed to Ras-dependent
transactivation of RAF dimers. Though we do not observe
increased ERK phosphorylation following PLX4720
treatment of TBP-3868 cells, ERK phosphorylation is
maintained. Treatment of the PLX4720-sensitive line,
TBP-3743, with PLX4720 reduces ERK phosphorylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and induces Ras activity. We did not observe increased
pSRC(Y416) in response to PLX4720 treatment, however
pFAK(Y861) and pAKT(S473) were elevated, suggesting
that BRAFV600E-inhibition influences upstream signaling.
While increased Ras, FAK and AKT activation following
MAPK pathway inhibition is consistent with a release of
negative feedback and consequent kinome reprogramming,
it is interesting to note that both FAK and Ras are activated
by PLX4720 treatment of TBP-3868 in the absence of
ERK dephosphorylation. Either, a slight reduction of
pERK, imperceptible by western blot analysis, is sufficient
for a release of negative feedback or the increased Ras
activity is induced by another mechanism. Though SRC
may modulate Ras activity via the Ras-GTPase Son-ofSevenless (SOS), combined treatment with dasatinib does
not have an appreciable effect on PLX4720-induced Ras
activity in TBP-3743 and only a modest effect on Ras
activity in TBP-3868.
PLX4720 is a potent inhibitor of migration,
significantly decreasing cellular migration and invasion
of human BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer lines in
vitro [6]. In spite of this, though significant, the antimigratory effect of PLX4720 is variable and incomplete
in the murine lines. Dasatinib treatment however nearly
completely reduced the migratory capacity of all the
murine lines examined. Interestingly, while there was no
further anti-migratory benefit of combined treatment of the
PTEN-intact lines, a modest but significant reduction was
observed in the PTEN-null treated with both PLX4720
and dasatinib relative to treatment with dasatinib alone
suggesting that the loss of PTEN confers a more migratory
phenotype in these thyroid cancer cell lines.
Combined PLX4720 and dasatinib treatment
induced apoptosis in a subset of the thyroid cancer lines
examined. Beyond modest inductions, neither PLX4720
nor dasatinib triggered robust apoptosis above baseline
when used alone but combined treatment with PLX4720
and dasatinib induced significant apoptosis in TBP-3743,
TBPt-3403 and in the two human lines tested, 8505c and
BCPAP. Though a cytotoxic response to therapy could not
be fully predicted based on genotype, differences between
the drug response of the PTEN-intact and -null lines
did manifest. While apoptosis was induce by combined
treatment of the PTEN-intact lines (TBP-3743, 8505c
and BCPAP) with the exception of TBP-3868 which is
resistant to PLX4720-mediated reduction of pERK, the
PTEN-null line TBPt-3610R did not exhibit a cytotoxic
response following combined treatment. And though the
PTEN-null line TBPt-3403 exhibited a significant increase
in apoptosis, it was modest compared to the induction
observed in the p53-null line TBP-3743. Dasatinib
treatment of TBP-3743 cells reduced pAKT levels,
perhaps permitting apoptosis, whereas the high basal
pAKT levels in the PTEN-null cells were unaffected by
dasatinib treatment, suggesting that the loss of PTEN and
the concomitant increase of AKT signaling may be a factor
4005

influencing resistance to apoptosis following BRAFV600Einhibition as has been demonstrated in melanoma [62].
In summary, the BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4720
and the SRC-inhibitor dasatinib synergize to inhibit
proliferation, reduce cellular migration and induce
apoptosis in a variety of BRAFV600E-positive PTC and ATC
cell lines. The reduction of tumor growth characterized
by increased apoptosis and immune cell infiltration in
a preclinical model of ATC further suggest that this
therapeutic combination holds promise for patients with
aggressive thyroid cancer and may further benefit from
additional combination with emerging immunotherapies.
Going forward it will be important to determine the effect
of combined treatment on metastasized thyroid cancer and
over an extended period of time, to elucidate the genetic
or epigenetic contributions leading to variable responses
to treatment and to further characterize the immune
response to treatment. Taken as a whole, these findings
now show high potential for clinical impact to patients
with BRAFV600E-positive anaplastic or refractory papillary
thyroid cancer, who currently lack an effective treatment.

unless otherwise specified.

Western Blot Analysis
Whole cell lysates (WCLs) were probed with
antibodies against phosphor-SRC(Y416), SRC, phosphoFAK(861), FAK, ERK, phospo-ERK(T202/Y404),
AKT, phospho-AKT(S473), PTEN, Caspase 3, PARP
and tubulin (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA)
following separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a
nitrocellulose membrane.

Ras activation assay
GTP-bound Ras was detected in WCLs obtained
from TBP-3743 and TBP-3868 cells treated as above
with DMSO, 10 µM PLX4720, 50 nM dasatinib or
a combination of both PLX4720 and dasatinib for
24 hours. We used the active Ras detection kit (Cell
Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) and followed the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, GST-bound CRAF
(RAF1) Ras binding domain (RBD) was incubated with
500 µg WCLs. Following sample preparation, input
whole cell lysates and pull down samples were separated
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
and probed for with antibodies against RAS, pERK(T202/
Y204), ERK and tubulin.

METHODS
Cell Culture and in vitro Drug Treatment
Murine cell lines (TBP-3868, TBP-3743, TBPt3403 and TBPt-3610R) were previously derived from
autochthonous tumors arising in “TBP” mice with
thyroid-specific expression of BrafV600E and thyroidspecific knockout of p53 (TPOCreER; Braftm1Mmcm/WT;
Trp53tm1Brn/tm1Brn) or “TBPt” mice with thyroid-specific
expression of BrafV600E and thyroid-specific knockout
of Pten (TPOCreER; Braftm1Mmcm/WT; Ptentm1Hwu/tm1Hwu) as
described (Table 1) [50] (Mcfadden et al, manuscript
submitted). For orthotopic implantation TBP-3743,
were previously lentivirally transduced to produce
cells expressing both luciferase and green fluorescent
protein (GFP) [50]. The murine lines, along with the
human ATC line, 8505c (Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikrooranismen und Zellkulturen), and the human PTC
line, BCPAP (previously provided by Dr. G. Damante of
the University of Udine, Italy), were maintained in culture
using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/
streptomycin.
For in vitro treatments, PLX4720 (Plexxikon Inc.,
Berkeley CA) and dasatinib (TSZChem-BIOTANG,
Lexington, MA) were each dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) to respectively yield 10 mM and 5 mM stock
solutions. Cells were treated with either 0.1% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), PLX4720 at concentrations ranging
from 0.1 µM to 100 µM, 50nM dasatinib, or a combination
of both 10 µM PLX4720 and 50 nM dasatinib overnight,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Proliferation Assay and Chou-Talalay Synergy
Analysis
Cellular proliferation was assessed with CellTiter
Aqueous One solution (Promega, Madison, WI). Murine
cell lines were plated in triplicate in 96 well plates with
2500 cells per well and treated with varying doses of
dasatinib, PLX4720 or a combination for 72 hours. Each
experiment was conducted in triplicate and independently
repeated three times. Prism (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) was used to calculate nonlinear fit of growth
curves and determination of IC50. Synergy was formally
assessed by Chou-Talalay analysis and the combination
index (CI) was calculated using Calcusyn (BioSoft,
Cambridge, UK).

Annexin-V Apoptosis Analysis
Cultured cells were collected, washed in PBS,
incubated with Annexin-V Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate in
Annexin-V binding buffer (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
Grand Island NY) and stained with propidium iodide
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for analysis on a BD Sorp 8 Laser
LSR II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Flow cytometry
data was analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc., Ashland,
OR). Experiments were repeated independently three

times and statistical comparison was made with one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post
hoc multiple comparison test. Statistical significance was
determined by p-values < 0.05.

Mice were anesthetized with CO2 and injected with
luciferin for the detection of luciferase activity using an
IVIS Imaging System 100 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA)
one week post-implantation prior to treatment and two
weeks post-implantation after one week of treatment.

Migration Assay
Migration assays were performed using 2.5x105 cells
per well. Cells were treated in DMEM containing 0.1%
FCS for 18 hours prior to seeding into 8 µm transwell
inserts containing DMEM with 0.1% FCS in the upper
well and DMEM with 5% FCS in the lower well. Cells
were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours prior to
methanol fixation, Giemsa staining and counting. Three
independent experiments were conducted in duplicate
and results were analyzed with Student’s t-test following
normalization of the DMSO-treated samples. p-values <
0.05 were considered significant.

Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis
Tissue specimens were fixed with 10% buffered
formalin phosphate and embedded in paraffin blocks.
Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were evaluated
by an endocrine pathologist (P.S.) and processed for
immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) as previously
described [8]. IHC was performed using CD8 (Leica
Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL), B220 (BD
Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), F4/80 (AbD Serotec, Raleigh,
NC) antibodies. Stained and IHC tissue sections were
photographed using an Olympus BX41 microscope and
the Olympus Q COLOR 5 photo camera (Olympus Corp.,
Lake Success, NY). Caspase 3 cleavage was quantified in
tumor sections by manually counting positive cells in ten
400X fields for each sample.

Orthotopic Implantation and in vivo Drug
Treatment
All animal work was done at Massachusetts General
Hospital (Harvard Medical School) in accordance with
federal, local, and institutional guidelines. TBP-3743
cells expressing luciferase and GFP were implanted in
the thyroids of B6129SF1/J syngeneic mice as previously
described [50, 63]. In brief, thyroids of age-matched
female B6129SF1/J mice were unilaterally implanted
with 105 TBP-3743-lucGFP cells suspended in 10 l serumfree DMEM. The right thyroid was not manipulated and
was used as an internal control. Mice were randomized
into four groups 6 days post-implantation and placed
on respective treatment regimens. The control group
received a control diet (Research Diets, Inc.) (n=9), the
PLX4720-treated group received PLX4720-impregnated
chow (417 mg/kg, Research Diets, Inc.) ad libitum (n=20),
the dasatinib-treated mice received control diet and were
orally gavaged with 50 mg/kg dasatinib (Toronto Research
Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) in 80 mM sodium
citrate five days per week (n=20), and the combined
treatment group received both PLX4720-impregnated
chow ad libitum and were orally gavaged with 50 mg/kg
dasatinib five days per week (n=20). Mice were weighed
every other day. Mice were sacrificed and tumor volume
was calculated as (π/6) × length × width × height [64].
Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was utilized
for statistical analysis of tumor volumes. Statistical
difference was determined with ANOVA followed by the
Tukey post hoc multiple comparison test and p-values <
0.05 were considered significant.
