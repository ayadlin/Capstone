Abstract
Runx2, required for bone formation, is ectopically expressed
in breast cancer cells. To address the mechanism by which
Runx2 contributes to the osteolytic disease induced by MDAMB-231 cells, we investigated the effect of Runx2 on key
components of the ‘‘vicious cycle’’ of transforming growth
factor B (TGFB)-mediated tumor growth and osteolysis. We
find that Runx2 directly up-regulates Indian Hedgehog (IHH)
and colocalizes with Gli2, a Hedgehog signaling molecule.
These events further activate parathyroid hormone-related
protein (PTHrP). Furthermore, Runx2 directly regulates the
TGFB-induced PTHrP levels. A subnuclear targeting deficient
mutant Runx2, which disrupts TGFB-induced Runx2-Smad
interactions, failed to induce IHH and downstream events. In
addition, Runx2 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 inhibited IHH
and PTHrP expression in the presence of TGFB. In vivo
blockade of the Runx2-IHH pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells by
Runx2 short hairpin RNA inhibition prevented the osteolytic
disease. Thus, our studies define a novel role of Runx2 in upregulating the vicious cycle of metastatic bone disease, in
addition to Runx2 regulation of genes related to progression
of tumor metastasis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7795–802]

Introduction
Bone provides a favorable site for cancer metastasis and the
aggressive tumor behavior of breast, prostate, and lung metastatic
cancer cells. Tumor cells anchor to the bone matrix proteins and
respond to the local production of growth factors, including
cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), receptor activator of
nuclear factor-nB ligand (RANKL), transforming growth factor
(TGFh), and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which
promote activation of transcription factors and bone-resorbing
osteoclasts (1, 2). The resulting tumor growth and severe osteolytic
disease leads to the end stage of cancer (3).
Runx2 is highly expressed in bone metastatic cancer cells but not
in nonmetastatic cancer cells (4). Runx2, a key factor for bone
formation, activates several genes (p21, RANKL, MMP2, MMP9,

MMP13, VEGF, OP, and BSP) required for bone development and
turnover (5). Importantly, these genes are regulated by Runx2 in
metastatic breast cancer cells (6, 7). This cohort of Runx2-regulated
genes has been identified as both markers of progression of tumor
growth and tumorigenesis and essential mediators of tumor
invasion and metastasis (8, 9). These well-known concepts for
the functional activities of the Runx2-regulated genes implicate this
master transcription factor in multiple events associated with
metastatic tumor growth and osteolytic disease in bone. What
remains unclear, however, is Runx2 linkage to the osteolytic
disease/pathway operative in bone microenvironment by cancer
cells. Indeed, a Runx2 mutant protein, which abolished functional
activity in subnuclear domains, inhibited the bone osteolysis
associated with breast cancer cells (2, 4, 10). However, the
mechanism by which Runx2 is permissive for osteolysis remains
a compelling question.
To understand the mechanism by which Runx2 participates in
metastatic bone disease, we investigated Runx2 regulation of key
components of the ‘‘vicious cycle’’ of tumor growth and bone
resorption. This cycle involves overproduction of PTHrP by breast
cancer cells that has a profound effect on tumor cell activities and
survival and, when present in the bone microenvironment, results
in osteoclastic bone resorption (1). The resorbed bone releases
TGFh-stimulating tumor cell proliferation and consequently
increased PTHrP secretion, thus continuing the vicious cycle (11).
Furthermore, PTHrP is regulated by Gli, a Hedgehog signaling
factor, and this pathway leads to pathologic consequences in a
variety of human tumors (12, 13).
Here, we show that Runx2 binds to the Indian Hedgehog (IHH)
promoter and activates its expression in cancer cells and that this
regulation further increases PTHrP levels, resulting in operation of
vicious cycle in cancer cells. Our studies show that Runx2 directly
contributes to the osteolytic process by regulating the IHH-PTHrP
pathway in breast cancer cells that leads to osteoclastogenesis
in vivo. We propose that metastatic cancer cells, by having higher
levels of Runx2, are able to activate components of the vicious cycle
and target genes that increase bone loss and promote tumor
progression in bone, resulting in the metastatic bone disease.

Western blot analysis. Runx2 protein in breast cancer cells was
detected as described previously (7). For Western blot analysis, whole-cell
lysates were mixed with direct lysis buffer and separated in a 10% SDSPAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and
incubated with mouse monoclonal Runx2 antibody followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce).
Chromatin immunoprecipitations. Chromatin immunoprecipitations
(ChIP) were performed as previously described (7). Briefly, formaldehyde
cross-linking was performed followed by sonication to obtain DNA
fragment with average size of 0.3 kb. Protein-DNA complexes were
immunoprecipitated using Runx2 antibody (M-70; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or IgG as a control. Purified DNA was subjected to real-time PCR
amplification with SYBR Green dye on ABI real-time thermocycler. IHH
promoter fragments (1.5 kb and 502 bp) containing Runx element were
amplified using forward primer 5¶-CTCAGAAGCCCAAGGAAGAGT-3¶ and
reverse primer 5¶-CACTACCCACTCCTTTATGCCC-3¶ for proximal promoter
fragment and forward primer 5¶-AATAGCATTTGAGTGAGAATTTTTAAG-3¶
and reverse primer 5¶-GGATCCCTTCTGCCAAAACAA-3¶ for distal promoter
fragment.
Small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA treatment. Breast
cancer cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes
at 30% to 50% confluency using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies). siRNA specific for human Runx2 oligo #1 r(CUCUGCACCAAGUCCUUUU)d(TT) and oligo #2 r(GGUUCAACGAUCUGAGAUU)d(TT) was
obtained from Qiagen, Inc. Cells were transfected with either Runx2 or
control siRNA duplexes specific for green fluorescent protein (GFP) at a
concentration of 50 nmol/L with Oligofectamine as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. To generate MDA-MB-231 cells expressing short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)-Runx2, we cloned 5¶-AAGGTTCAACGATCTGATTTG-3¶ sequence
in pLVTHM vector under H1 promoter and generated lentiviral particles
using Invitrogen BLOCK-iT kit. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with
lentivirus and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for GFP signal to obtain
shRNA-expressing cell population. Runx2 knockdown efficiency was
confirmed by Western blot analysis.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Expression levels of
IHH, Runx2, PTHrP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) from MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and PC3 cells were analyzed after
Runx2 siRNA treatment or adenovirus transduction. Total RNA was isolated
using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s specification.
Purified RNA was oligo(dT) primed and cDNA was synthesized at 42jC
with SuperScript II RNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then
used for real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). For PCR amplification,
the following primers were used: IHH, 5¶-TAGGCCATAGCAGACG ( forward)
and 5¶-TTAAGGCCCATATCAGG-3¶ (reverse); PTHrP (1-139), ACTAACGACCCGCCCTCG ( forward) and GAACAAGTTTCAAGTGCGTGTGTC
(reverse); PTHrP (1-141), AGGAGGCGGTTAGCCCTGT ( forward) and
TCCCATAGCAATGTCTAATTAATCTGG (reverse); and PTHrP (total),
ACCTCGGAGGTGTCCCCTAAC ( forward) and TCAGACCCAAATCGGACGG (reverse). Primer sequences for Runx2 and GAPDH are described
previously (7). Primers and probes for the tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP), tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), integrin h3, and av
genes were all Assays-on-Demand products from Applied Biosystems and
reactions were set up according to the manufacturer’s directions.
Histologic analysis and immunohistochemistry. H&E staining was
performed on paraffin sections from tibial tissues harvested after 15 d of
cancer cell injection and fixed in 4%paraformaldehyde and decalcified in
14% EDTA solution as previously described (15). Ki-67 (1:100, rabbit
polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunohistochemistry was performed by using antigen retrieval with antigen unmasking solution
(DakoCytomation) diluted 1:100. Sections were incubated overnight with
Ki-67 antibody followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies and developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine. TRAP enzyme
detection for showing osteoclast activities was performed using reagent
kits from Sigma-Aldrich Biotechnology. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

using the In situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche). Proliferation of the stable
MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shRNA-Runx2 or scramble was quantitated
by flow cytometry of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-labeled cells with FITCBrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences; ref. 16).
In vivo experiments. Groups of six severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice were injected with MDA-MB-231 cells (expressing shRNARunx2 or scramble sequence; 1  105 cells in 100 AL PBS) in medullar cavity
of tibia. X-ray analysis was performed on Faxitron soft X-ray machine to
monitor osteolysis.

Results
Runx2 is ectopically expressed in breast cancer cells and
regulates IHH-PTHrP signaling. Deregulation of Runx factors is
associated with several types of cancers, with Runx2 being highly
expressed in bone metastatic breast cancer cells (17, 18). To further
understand the molecular mechanism by which Runx2 contributes
to the metastatic bone disease, we examined the linkage between
Runx2 and factor(s) responsible for osteolysis, PTHrP. Secretion of
PTHrP from cancer cells activates and recruits osteoclasts to bone
surface and causes bone destruction (1, 3, 19). Recently, Hedgehog
signaling has been implicated in regulation of PTHrP in breast
cancer cells (12). Consistent with the previous results, Fig. 1A
shows the robust endogenous Runx2 levels in the highly metastatic
MDA-MB-231 cells and near absence in the nonmetastatic MCF7
cell line. The MDA-MB-231 cells also show high levels of IHH and
PTHrP as detected by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 1B and C). These

48 h of viral transduction. The mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH.

Runx2 Supports TGFb-PTHrP Pathway of Osteolytic Disease

results suggest a causal relation between Runx2 protein and
expression levels of IHH and PTHrP in breast cancer cells. We
further examined the mechanism of IHH activation and its
downstream signaling events modulated by Runx2 in breast cancer
cells.
Downstream events of IHH signaling in breast cancer cells
result in activation of PTHrP and consequently activates
osteoclasts through RANKL. To understand the regulation of
IHH expression in breast cancer cells, we transduced MDA-MB231 cells with adenovirus expressing GFP or WT Runx2 protein.
Cells were harvested at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after infection and total
RNA was examined for IHH expression by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. Runx2 transduction efficiency and protein levels were confirmed by GFP signal and Western
blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Ectopic expression of
Runx2 results in a robust activation of IHH mRNA levels after
6 h of adenovirus infection, which further increased up to 35-fold
by 48 h (Fig. 1D, left), whereas control GFP virus failed to increase
basal level of IHH at any time point examined. Furthermore, we
find a significant 2- to 3-fold induction in total PTHrP levels in
MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with Runx2 adenovirus (Fig. 1D,
right). The two isoforms of PTHrP (1-139 and 1-141) were
examined by real-time PCR analysis and both are activated to the
same extent by Runx2 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1B and C). We further confirmed this positive regulation of
IHH and PTHrP by Runx2 in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D
and E) and PC3 bone metastatic prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1F and G) and find similar results as in MDA-MB231 cells.
Runx2 COOH-terminal multifunctional transactivating
domain is critical for IHH and PTHrP expression and
directly regulates the IHH gene. To evaluate the functional
domain of Runx2 responsible for IHH induction in breast cancer
cells, we tested the Runx2 mutant protein that is defective in the
COOH-terminal activities required for forming transcriptionally
active complexes in subnuclear domains. The MDA-MB-231 cells
were infected with adenovirus expressing WT and Runx2 D361
mutant protein. In Fig. 2A, activation of IHH and PTHrP is
reduced by 75% compared with WT protein. The in vivo
phenotype of this mutant is complete loss of bone formation
(20). Runx2 D361 mutant protein lacks an activation/repression
functional domain but retains normal DNA-binding activity.
Therefore, to show that Runx2 activates IHH-PTHrP directly, we
examined DBD mutant protein and find that it failed to induce
IHH or PTHrP in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). Expression levels
of these mutants are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A as
examined by Western blot analysis. The PTHrP expression levels
were reduced to the range of basal levels by both Runx2 D361
and DBD mutant, suggesting that the decrease is a secondary
response to IHH. The striking block in IHH activation by Runx2
DBD mutant indicates a direct protein-DNA interaction required
for transcriptional activation. The IHH response to the mutant
Runx2 proteins suggests that both signaling component due to
Runx2 COOH-terminal function and direct DNA binding to IHH
promoter are necessary.
To determine if Runx2 activation of IHH is a result of
recruitment of Runx2 on the IHH promoter, we performed ChIP
assay in MDA-MB-231 cells. Four putative Runx-binding elements
5¶-TGTGGT-3¶ are present within the 1.5 kb of 5¶ flanking sequence
of human IHH gene (Fig. 2C). We used Runx2 and IgG control
antibody and immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for in vivo

levels of IHH and PTHrP by qRT-PCR analysis. B, the schematic shows
1.5-kb 5¶-upstream promoter fragment of IHH gene. The putative Runx-binding

occupancy of the IHH promoter by quantitative PCR (qPCR)
analysis. The IHH proximal promoter Runx site shows greater
binding of Runx2 compared with the distal promoter fragments
(Fig. 2D). These results show that Runx2 activates IHH by directly
binding to its promoter elements in breast cancer cells.
Runx2-mediated PTHrP regulation requires IHH signaling.
Our results suggest that Runx2 can induce IHH and PTHrP
expression in breast cancer cells. A recent report shows that IHH
signaling molecule, Gli2, is involved in PTHrP regulation in bone
metastatic cancer cells (12). To understand the contribution of IHH
signaling in Runx2-mediated PTHrP induction, we used Hedgehog
signaling inhibitor cyclopamine and examined PTHrP induction
with overexpression of Runx2 in breast cancer cells. Cyclopamine
blocks interaction of Smoothened and Patch receptors and thus
inhibits downstream Hedgehog signaling events to its targets.
Blocking Hedgehog signaling results in loss of Runx2-mediated
induction of PTHrP after 12 h (Fig. 3A) or 24 h (Fig. 3B) of
cyclopamine treatment. These results show that both Runx2 and

Figure 3. IHH signaling is required for Runx2-mediated regulation of PTHrP.
The MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced with Runx2 or GFP adenovirus followed
by Hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine (C ; 5 Amol/L) treatment. Total RNA from
cells harvested at 12 h (A ) or 24 h (B ) was used to detect PTHrP levels by

IHH signaling are required for PTHrP expression in breast cancer
cells.
Runx2 is required for TGFB-mediated activation of PTHrP
and cyclin D1 in breast cancer cells. During metastasis, tumor
cells secrete factors that stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption, which releases active factors from the bone matrix,
particularly TGFh. It has been shown that TGFh stimulates PTHrP
and osteolytic metastases via Smad and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (21). Several studies also
showed that Runx2 is a key component in TGFh signaling by
interacting with Smad proteins (14, 22, 23). The present study
indicates that levels of PTHrP are regulated by Runx2. To further

investigate the role of Runx2 in TGFh-induced PTHrP levels in
breast cancer cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with Runx2
siRNA oligos to deplete Runx2 protein in the presence and absence
of TGFh and examined PTHrP mRNA levels (Fig. 4). The
knockdown of Runx2 protein after siRNA was confirmed by
Western blot analysis, which shows >75% depletion compared with
controls in both the absence and presence of TGFh (Fig. 4A).
Runx2 knockdown had no effect on basal IHH expression but did
decrease IHH in TGFh-treated samples (Fig. 4B). Consistent with
previous reports (21), we find a 10-fold increase in PTHrP
expression on TGFh treatment (Fig. 4C, left). Runx2 knockdown
results in significant down-regulation of TGFh-induced PTHrP
levels compared with nonspecific siRNA or untreated control
samples. To address if the decrease in PTHrP by Runx2 is a
consequence of decreased IHH, we examined PTHrP expression in
the presence of cyclopamine and find a 2-fold decrease in TGFhinduced PTHrP levels (Fig. 4C, right). Therefore, the decreased IHH
by knockdown of Runx2 (Fig. 4B) accounts for decreased PTHrP
expression.
We performed complementary studies where MDA-MB-231 cells
were transduced with Runx2 or control GFP adenovirus and
examined the PTHrP levels after TGFh treatment. Our results
indicate that overexpression of Runx2 further enhances TGFhmediated expression levels of PTHrP up to 2- to 3-fold over
endogenous levels in breast cancer cells (Fig. 4D). These results
indicate that Runx2 is a key regulator of IHH as well as TGFhinduced PTHrP expression.
We further addressed how Runx2 levels affect the direct PTHrP
downstream target gene, cyclin D1 (24). Cyclin D1 is a key cell cycle
regulatory protein with shown oncogenic activity in a variety of
malignancies, including breast cancer (25). Importantly, cyclin D1
is a fundamental target gene of TGFh and PTHrP during skeletal

blot analysis. Cells were harvested for total RNA to detect

Runx2 Supports TGFb-PTHrP Pathway of Osteolytic Disease

growth (26, 27). To examine the contribution of Runx2 in cyclin D1
regulation by PTHrP and TGFh, we performed in situ immunofluorescence and RT-PCR studies to detect endogenous cyclin D1 in
TGFh-treated MDA-MB-231 cells expressing either shRNA for
Runx2 or scramble sequence. We find that TGFh treatment in
MDA-MB-231 cells increases cyclin D1 levels analogous to
regulation in normal skeletal cells (Fig. 5A, top, Scramble). However,
knockdown of endogenous Runx2 in these cells abolished the
TGFh-mediated cyclin D1 induction as shown by in situ
immunofluorescence (Fig. 5A, bottom) and quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis (data not shown). Taken together, these studies
show that Runx2 is a key transcription factor in regulating the
complete pathway from TGFh to PTHrP to cyclin D1 in breast
cancer cells.
Runx2 colocalizes with Hedgehog signaling molecule Gli2.
Hedgehog signaling is mediated by Gli proteins to its downstream
targets (e.g., PTHrP; ref. 12). To understand how Runx2 modulates
Hedgehog-PTHrP pathway and its mediators, we examined
colocalization of Runx2 with Gli1 and Gli2 by in situ immunofluorescence. We find significant increase in colocalization of
endogenous Runx2 molecule with Gli2 (Fig. 5B) in the TGFhtreated (35%) MDA-MB-231 cells compared with treatment control
(3%). There was no significant colocalization of Runx2-Gli1
detected (data not shown) in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results
indicate that Runx2 cooperates with Hedgehog signaling molecule
specifically through Gli2 in regulation of downstream target genes
in metastatic breast cancer cells in response to TGFh treatment.
Depletion of Runx2 results in decreased osteoclasts formation. It has been previously documented that Runx2 expression in
highly bone metastatic breast MDA-MB-231 and prostate PC3 cells
is associated with osteolytic disease (4, 7). To determine the
relationship between this activity of Runx2 and PTHrP pathway, we
developed stable MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shRNA for Runx2.
Depletion of Runx2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 6A, left). To test the hypothesis that Runx2 in MDA-MB-231
cells alters the response to PTHrP that leads to induced RANKL
production from osteogenic lineage cells in bone microenvironment, we cocultured shRNA-Runx2 or control cells with MC3T3
osteoblastic cells. The conditioned medium from this coculture
was then used (in a 50:50 ratio with fresh medium) to differentiate
ex vivo mouse bone marrow cell osteoclasts in the absence of
exogenous RANKL. Our result shows significantly less formation
(70% reduction) of multinucleated cells detected by osteoclastspecific TRAP staining (day 7) in cells incubated with shRNA-Runx2
breast cancer cell conditioned medium compared with control cells
(Fig. 6A, right). The RT-PCR analysis of genes expressed in the day 7
bone marrow cultures revealed down-regulation of osteoclast
markers (TRAP, cathepsin K, TNFa, and integrins av and h3) in
cells cultured in shRNA-Runx2 conditioned medium in comparison
with controls (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results are consistent
with the known activation of PTH/PTHrP in increasing osteoclastogenesis and inhibition of the PTHrP signaling in decreasing
osteoclast formation (11, 28, 29) and now provide direct evidence
for Runx2 in breast cancer cells in contributing toward the
activation of osteoclasts in the bone microenvironment by cancer
cells through regulation of IHH and PTHrP expression.
Runx2 knockdown blocks breast cancer cell–mediated
osteolysis in vivo. We show that Runx2 activates TGFh-mediated
PTHrP levels in breast cancer cells and depletion of Runx2 in MDAMB-231 cells decreases osteoclast differentiation derived from bone
marrow cells. To further evaluate direct consequence of Runx2

knockdown in breast cancer cell–mediated osteolysis induced by
PTHrP in vivo, we performed intratibial injections of MDA-shRNAscramble or MDA-shRNA-Runx2 cells in SCID mice (n = 6) and
assessed the bone loss up to 3 weeks after injections. Our results
indicate that MDA-shRNA-scramble cells produce massive osteolysis within 15 days of injections in all (n = 6) mice, whereas MDAshRNA-Runx2 cells did not show any significant evidence of
osteolytic disease in five of six mice (Fig. 6B, osteolysis indicated by
arrows). Only one mouse had evidence of minor trabecular bone
loss as examined by radiography (Fig. 6B, minor osteolysis
indicated by *).
We next addressed the cellular changes in the tumor-bone
microenvironment resulting in decreased metastatic bone disease
(Fig. 6C). We performed detailed characterization of the tibial
bones by histologic, Ki-67, and TUNEL analysis. In the shRNAscramble control group, large tumor areas were present within the
marrow cavity of the tibial sections and in muscle tissue outside

lineage cells in bone microenvironment further activates osteoclast. The resorbed bone releases TGFh, thereby stimulating tumor cell proliferation and consequently
increased PTHrP secretion and more bone resorption, thus continuing the vicious cycle. It is not clear how Runx2 activates PTHrP through interactions with
coregulatory factors that increase PTHrP expression.

Runx2 Supports TGFb-PTHrP Pathway of Osteolytic Disease

the bone. We find increased presence of large multinucleated
osteoclasts in shRNA-scramble group accounting for complete loss
of trabecular and cortical bone compared with shRNA-Runx2
animals as examined by TRAP staining (Fig. 6C). Minimal change in
bone tissue organization was observed in the shRNA-Runx2 group
animals (Fig. 6C). Thick bone trabeculae are found under the
growth plate. The medullary cavity was composed of mostly
normal intact marrow tissue with a few small aggregates of tumor
cells with minimal osteolysis observed on the endosteal surface.
Interestingly, we find a 37% decrease in the population of actively
proliferating tumor cells in small tumor aggregates found in the
group expressing shRNA-Runx2 compared with scramble controls
by Ki-67 staining (Fig. 6C). We further examined apoptotic index in
tumor cells by TUNEL assay on tibial sections and find no
significant difference of apoptotic cell number between shRNAscramble and shRNA-Runx2 animals (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
These observations suggested that shRNA-Runx2 cells have
decreased growth responsiveness in the bone microenvironment.
To further strengthen this conclusion, we examined in vitro cell
proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shRNA-Runx2 and
find no significant difference from shRNA-scramble–expressing
cells as determined by BrdUrd labeling (Supplementary Fig. S3B
and C). Therefore, the major consequence of shRNA-Runx2 seems
to be an inhibition of the TGFh-tumor cell growth response and a
significant block of the osteolysis event. Thus, these results show a
direct role of Runx2 in TGFh-PTHrP–mediated activation of the
bone-destructive vicious cycle operative in breast cancer cells
(Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The present study provides the direct evidence linking Runx2
to PTHrP and the vicious cycle of osteolytic disease by
activation of the IHH gene in breast cancer cells. Runx2
mediates IHH transcription in both breast and prostate cancer
cells and this event further activates PTHrP expression. The
DNA-binding activity and the COOH-terminal domain of Runx2
are essential for IHH activation, indicating that the subnuclear
organization of the Runx2 regulatory complex is required for this
transcriptional event. This activation is physiologic in that it
leads to IHH downstream signaling for PTHrP induction to
occur as shown by the inability of Runx2 to activate PTHrP in
the presence of Hedgehog signaling inhibitor, cyclopamine.
Importantly, we show that Runx2 facilitates PTHrP signaling as
a mediator of TGFh-induced PTHrP levels and osteolysis by
bone metastatic breast cancer cells, and a complete block in the
signaling pathway by shRNA-Runx2 prevented bone resorption
by MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo. In conclusion, we propose that
Runx2 is an important component of TGFh-IHH-PTHrP axis
operative in breast cancer cells that contributes to the osteolytic
disease. Our earlier study showed that blocking the subnuclear
targeting function of Runx2 inhibits osteolytic lesions (10). Thus,
the present study defines a contributory mechanism to account
for those findings where blocking Runx2 inhibits the TGFhPTHrP signaling pathway.
Under physiologic conditions in developing chondrocytes, IHH
is regulated by Runx2 (30, 31). Our results show a similar
regulatory mechanism in bone metastatic breast cancer cells. In
the developing growth plate, IHH regulates PTHrP levels (32) and a
similar mode of regulation is operative in breast cancer cells where
PTHrP expression and osteolysis is driven at least in part by Gli2

www.aacrjournals.org

(12), a mediator of Hedgehog signaling. Thus, our present findings
support the concept that cancer cells in bone assume an
osteomimicry property (33). Cancer cells in the bone microenvironment respond to TGFh and take advantage of gene regulatory
mechanisms operative under the physiologic conditions using
master transcription factors such as Runx2 for their survival and
promoting osteolytic disease through activation of the IHH-PTHrP
pathway. Notably, the Runx2 COOH terminus contains the Smadinteracting domain that responds to the TGFh/bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction pathway (14). This domain is
required for IHH expression and PTHrP signaling. Thus, our
studies provide a novel insight into how metastatic cells become
pseudo-osteoblast and secrete bone-resorptive cytokines, such as
PTHrP (1, 3) and RANKL (34). The vicious cycle, which functions
due to these factors and is partly controlled by a master regulatory
transcription factor Runx2, is responsible for pathologic conditions
of cancer and causes severe pain and fracture in breast cancer
patients.
We and others have previously reported that bone metastatic
breast cancer cells produce high amounts of Runx2 transcription
factor (6, 7, 35). Runx2 may not only facilitate the bone osteolysis
but also promotes metastasis and tumor growth in bone. Runx2
increases expression of several downstream target genes (MMP9,
MMP13, VEGF, MMP2, RANKL, and BSP) associated with metastatic
activity of cancer cells (6, 36). Therefore, Runx2 may contribute to
the onset of metastasis, as well as the vicious cycle in bone
microenvironment. The mechanism for breast cancer cell survival
and growth, which finally leads to the destruction of bone tissue, is
still not fully understood. The presence of Runx2 in metastatic cells
also controls activation of genes related to both cell growth and
tissue destruction. Runx2 down-regulates p21, inhibitor of cell
growth, and induces MMPs (extracellular matrix–degrading
enzymes) and RANKL, an activator of osteolytic resorption. We
now add to this list of Runx2-destructive activities in cancer cells
induction of PTHrP.
A key finding in our studies is that Runx2 directly regulates basal
expression of IHH and mediates TGFh-induced PTHrP levels in
breast cancer cells. The presence of TGFh greatly enhanced the
effects of overexpression and knockdown of Runx2 on IHH and
PTHrP expression. Physical interaction between TGFh-induced
Smads and Runx2 has been established in several cell types
(6, 37–39). Thus, a Runx2-Smad complex may be contributing to
regulation of these genes. In addition, MAPK signaling and the
synergy between Smad and Ets proteins has been shown for TGFhmediated regulation of PTHrP in MDA-MB-231 cells (21). Ets, like
Smad proteins, also interacts with Runx factors (40). Our finding of
colocalization of Runx2 and Gli2 in breast cancer is consistent with
the recently reported interaction between Runx2 and IHH signaling
molecule Gli2 that is important for Runx2 function in osteoblast
differentiation (41). These reports together with our results suggest
that Runx2 interaction with its cofactors, such as Smads, Ets, and
Gli2 (as we show), is a key event in activation of IHH and PTHrP in
cancer cells. Our results from histologic analysis and Ki-67 staining
of tumors show that Runx2 depletion in cancer cells decreases their
growth responsiveness to TGFh in the bone microenvironment.
The reduced growth response of cancer cells further inhibits the
activation of osteoclasts and bone erosion, thus blocking the
vicious cycle.
In conclusion, we have presented direct evidence that Runx2,
in addition to promoting expression of metastasis related
markers, also activates IHH and is an integral part of TGFh-
