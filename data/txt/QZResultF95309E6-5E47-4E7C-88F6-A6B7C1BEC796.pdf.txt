Abstract
It has been reported that levo-1-methyl tryptophan (L-1MT)
can block indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expressed by
human dendritic cells (DC), whereas dextro-1-methyl tryptophan (D-1MT) is inefficient. However, whether L-1MT or
D-1MT can efficiently reverse IDO-induced arrest of human
T-cell proliferation has not been clarified. Here, we show a
marked immunosuppressive effect of IDO derived from INDOtransfected 293 cell, IDO+ ovarian cancer cells, and monocytederived DCs on CD4+ Th1 cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer
cells derived from peripheral blood, ascites, and tumors of
ovarian cancer patients. We found that, whereas L-1MT and
D/L-1MT can restore proliferation of tumor-derived and
peripheral blood T-cell subsets, D-1MT does not effectively
restore IDO-induced arrest of T-cell proliferation. Although
D-1MT inhibited kynurenine production at high concentrations, L-1MT was more effective in abrogating kynurenine
generation and tryptophan depletion, whereas tryptophan
was completely depleted by IDO even in the presence of
high amounts of D-1MT. Together, the results indicate that,
whereas the generation of tryptophan metabolites (kynurenines) by IDO is important in mediating suppression of T-cell
proliferation, the degree to which tryptophan depletion is
restored by 1MT is also critical in overcoming IDO-induced
arrest of T-cell proliferation. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5498–504]

Introduction
The immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO) catalyzes tryptophan metabolism and plays a key role in the
immune tolerance of semiallogeneic fetus (1), an effect possibly
through tryptophan depletion and via the generation of proapoptotic metabolites (2, 3). Several lines of evidence also suggest a link
between IDO enzyme activity and tumoral immune tolerance (3).
IDO+ human antigen presenting cells have been shown to reduce
tryptophan, suppress T-cell activation, and promote tolerance in
the tumor microenvironment (4) and tumor draining lymph nodes

(5). Recently, tumor expression of IDO has been shown to correlate
with poor prognosis in several human malignancies, including
endometrial (6), colon (7), and epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOC;
ref. 8). Furthermore, we previously showed that EOC patients with
higher frequencies of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells showed improved
survival compared with patients with lower frequencies (9). These
observations have prompted our interest in the use of IDO
inhibitor drugs to overcome IDO-mediated arrest of T-cell
proliferation and potentially enhance the efficacy of vaccineinduced immune responses in human ovarian cancer.
The IDO blocking agent 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT) has been
shown to have significant ability to inhibit IDO activity and
cooperate with chemotherapy in mediating regression of established
tumors in murine models (10). In the murine models, the effect of
1MT was lost in immunodeficient Rag1 knockout hosts, indicating
that the antitumor effect of 1MT was immune mediated. The overall effects of 1MT include enhanced T-cell responses against tumor
antigen and autoantigens in vivo (11, 12), along with inhibiting
production of tryptophan catabolites, such as kynurenine, which
have been shown to directly reduce T-cell and natural killer (NK)
cell proliferation (13–15). In previous studies, whereas the L stereoisomer of 1MT was a more potent inhibitor of IDO, the D stereoisomer was shown to have superior antitumor activity and to be
more effective in inhibiting IDO-expressing tolerogenic dendritic
cells (DC) in preclinical models (16). A potential explanation for the
discrepant biochemical and antitumor effects was provided by the
discovery of the IDO2 gene, which seems to be preferentially inhibited by dextro-1MT (D-1MT; ref. 17). However, recent human
studies indicate that levo-1MT (L-1MT) inhibits IDO activity in
human DCs via blockade of IDO1 (18). Thus, whereas the IDO2
gene seems to be functional in murine models, it was not found to
be functional in humans (18) and may not adequately explain the
effects of D-1MT.
To determine which of the 1MT stereoisomers should be tested in
human ovarian cancer immunotherapy trials, we assessed susceptibility of lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood, ascites, and
tumor tissues of EOC patients to IDO-expressing cells and examined
the ability of different isomers of 1MT in overcoming T-cell suppression. Our data indicate that T cells derived from EOC patients are
suppressed by IDO-expressing cells. Although human IDO activity
can be inhibited by D-1MT, L-1MT, and racemic (D/L-1MT), only
L-1MT and D/L-1MT can reverse T-cell suppression. These findings
have significant implications in selecting IDO inhibitors for testing
in clinical trials.

L-1MT Reverses IDO-Mediated T-Cell Arrest

Materials and Methods
Patients, cell lines, and reagents. Peripheral blood, ascitic fluid, and
tumor specimens were obtained from patients undergoing debulking
surgery for EOC at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Blood samples were also
obtained from normal healthy volunteers as controls. All specimens were
collected under an approved protocol from the institutional review board.
Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 and IDO1 (encoded by INDO)–
transfected 293 cell line (293IDO) were gifts from Dr. Benoı̂t J. Van den
Eynde (3). Primary ovarian cancer cell lines were generated in our laboratory from patients undergoing surgery at our institution. Established
ovarian cancer cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. Monocyte-derived DCs were generated as previously described
(2, 19). Briefly, CD14+ cells were purified from normal donor peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBL) by monocyte isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec) and
cultured in the presence of 50 ng/mL recombinant human interleukin-4
(IL-4; R&D Systems) and 50 ng/mL recombinant human granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems) in complete media.
On day 6 of culture, immature DCs (iDC) were treated for 36 h with
a combination of 500 ng/mL CD40 ligand (CD40L; Sigma-Aldrich) and
5 Ag/mL lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich). IDO synthesis was induced
by incubating iDCs with 50ng/mL IFN-g (Becton Dickinson Pharmingen)
along with maturation factors. IDO activity was measured by kynurenine
production from the supernatant.
Isolation of PBL, tumor-associated lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes, and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood samples were collected
in heparinized tubes, and mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient separation using Ficoll/Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich). Tumor-associated
lymphocytes (TAL) were obtained from centrifuged cell pellets of ascitic
fluid. The pellets were washed twice in PBS, placed on Ficoll-Hypaque
density gradients, and centrifuged again to harvest TALs and tumor cells.
For the isolation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or lymphocytes
from draining lymph nodes (LN), tumor specimens or lymph nodes were
finely minced in cell culture medium and single-cell suspensions were
washed twice in PBS followed by Ficoll-Hypaque purification. Enriched
TAL and TIL preparations were washed twice in PBS and frozen in media
containing 90% fetal bovine serum and 10% DMSO at 80jC until use.
Assessment of cellular proliferation and suppression. Magnetic bead
separation technology (Invitrogen Dynal AS) was used to generate CD8+,
CD4+, or CD25-depleted CD4+ (CD4+CD25 ) T-cell subsets. CFSE-labeled
T cells were separately cultured with IDO+ suppressive cells with or without
1 mmol/L D-1MT, L-1MT, or D/L-1MT (Sigma-Aldrich) with plate-bound
anti-CD3 (UCHT1 clone, 5 Ag/mL) and soluble anti-CD28 (CD28.2 clone,
1 Ag/mL) monoclonal antibodies (mAb; BD Biosciences). The ability of IDO
to suppress the growth of responder T cells was assessed by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) after coculturing for 3 to 6 d.
Antibodies and FACS analysis. Anti–CD3-APC H7, CD4-APC, CD8-PECy7, CD25-PE-Cy5, CD56-PE, and Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I
were purchased from Becton Dickinson Pharmingen. LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Dead Cell Stain kits were from Invitrogen. Surface staining was performed
for 15 to 20 min at 4jC in FACS tubes containing 1 to 2 million total cells in
100 AL staining buffer (PBS with 1% FCS and 0.05% NaN3; Sigma-Aldrich).
For intracellular staining for cytokines expression, CD4+ T cells were
incubated with 1 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1 Amol/L ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. Brefeldin-A (SigmaAldrich) was added to the samples, and the cells were incubated for an
additional 4 h. After that, cells were stained with PE-Cy7–labeled CD4 mAb
and LIVE/DEAD, fixed, and stained intracellular cytokine with allophycocyanin-labeled IFN-g mAb and PE-labeled IL-4 mAbs (BD Pharmingen) in
permeabilizing solution (CALTAG) containing normal mouse IgG (CALTAG)
at room temperature for 30 min. Anti-IDO antibodies were from Chemicon
International and used as described (20). Stained samples were acquired on
an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiVa software, and
listmode data were analyzed with WinList (Verity Software House).
High-performance liquid chromatography measurement of tryptophan and kynurenine. The high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) method reported for the separation and measurement of

supernatant was dried under vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in 150 AL
of mobile phase, and a 20-AL injection was made. Standards (ranging from
0.1 to 5 Ag/mL) and quality control samples prepared in mobile phase were
extracted, as described above along with the cell supernatant samples. The
separation of tryptophan and kynurenine was carried out on an Acquity
BEH C18 column (2.1  100 mm 1.7 Am, Waters Associates). Mobile phase
consisted of (a) 10% acetonitrile with 10% of 10 mmol/L formic acid (pH 3)
and (b) 10% of 10 mmol/L formic acid in 100% acetonitrile (pH 3). Flow rate
was set at 0.533 mL/min. Separation was achieved using a gradient from 0
to 80% (b) in 3 min. Detection was at 225.1 nm. Retentions for tryptophan
and kynurenine were 1.1 and 0.75 min respectively.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor specimens were fixed with buffered
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 Am) were placed on glass
slides, heated at 60jC for 20 min, and then deparaffinized with xylene and
ethanol. For antigen retrieval, tumor specimens mounted on glass slides
were immersed in preheated antigen retrieval solution (DAKO high-pH
solution; DAKO) for 20 min and allowed to cool for 20 min at room
temperature. After the inactivation of endogenous peroxidase, purified IDOspecific mAb (Abcam; 1:20 dilution or 75 Ag/mL) were then added and
incubated overnight at 4jC. The primary antibody was detected with a
biotinylated antimouse IgG (DAKO). Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
was then added for development for 10 min and then followed by
counterstaining with hematoxylin solution. Immunohistochemical reactivity was graded based on percentage of tumor cell positivity and intensity as
follows: negative (no staining), 6% to 25% of cells stained (+), 26% to 50% of
cells stained (++), 51% to 75% of cells stained (+++), and >75% of cells
stained (++++). The intensity was graded as negative (n), weak (w),
moderate (m), and strong (s). Negative control slides omitting the primary
antibody were included in all assays.
Statistical analysis. Comparison between paired or unpaired groups
was performed using the appropriate Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05 was
defined as statistically significant.

Results
L-1MT, but not D-1MT, restores proliferation of T cells
suppressed by IDO in peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
TILs, and TALs of ovarian cancer patients. To investigate the
effect of IDO on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, we
first showed that human CD4+ T-cell proliferation was inhibited by
IDO-expressing cells, and this inhibition was most significant in the
Th1 subset and can be reversed by the IDO inhibitor L-1MT
(Supplementary Figs. S1–S3, available online). To determine the
efficiency of 1MT stereoisomers in inhibiting human IDO function,
the effects of D-1MT, L-1MT, and D/L-1MT on T-cell proliferation
were tested. CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells isolated from peripheral
blood of ovarian cancer patients were cocultured with IDOexpressing cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, >70% of cells were divided
when CD4+ T cells were cocultured with 293 cells with or without
different isomers of 1MT, suggesting that none of the isomers affect
CD4+ T-cell proliferation by themselves. In contrast, CD4+ T-cell
proliferation was significantly reduced to <2% when they were
cocultured with 293IDO. Notably, CD4+ T-cell proliferation was
restored to 59% and 54%, respectively, when L-1MT and D/L-1MT
were added. However, the addition of D-1MT did not restore T-cell
proliferation.
Next, we examined the different isomers of 1MT in relation to
CD8+ T cells derived from peripheral blood of EOC patients.
Consistent with the results from CD4+ T cells, proliferation of CD8+
T cells was also suppressed by 293IDO cells and the suppression
was restored by L-1MT and D/L-1MT, but not by D-1MT (Fig. 1A).
To determine the direct role of IDO in suppressing T-cell
proliferation in the human ovarian tumor environment, we isolated
TILs and TALs from ovarian cancer patients and coincubated these

from normal donor PBLs were cultured under anti-CD3 mAb stimulation.
At 4 d later, CD4+ T-cell proliferation was tested by CFSE dilution. B, L-1MT
and D/L-1MT are more efficient in suppressing IDO functional activity of
both primary ovarian cancer cells and established ovarian cancer cell lines.

stereoisomers. Similar to the results obtained from healthy donor
and ovarian cancer PBMCs, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells derived from
TILs or TALs proliferated significantly when cocultured with 293
cells with and without 1MT. On the other hand, CD4+ and CD8+
T-cell proliferation was inhibited when cocultured with 293IDO
cells. However, T-cell proliferation was significantly restored when
L-1MT and D/L-1MT were added to 293IDO cocultures. D-1MT was
inefficient in reversing T-cell suppression (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we
also observed NK (CD56+CD3 ) cell suppression by 293IDO cells
in PBMCs, TILs, and TALs of ovarian cancer patients (Fig. 1C).
Proliferation of NK cells was suppressed by IDO, and L-1MT, but
not D-1MT, was able to restore NK cell proliferation.
IDO+ ovarian cancer cells suppress T-cell proliferation.
Because of the profound suppressive effects of IDO-expressing cells
on tumor-derived and peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and NK
cells, we tested a tissue microarray of 201 EOC specimens. IDO
expression was observed in 83 of 192 (43%) of ovarian cancer
specimens and tumor expression of IDO resulted in lower ratio
of tryptophan to kyneurine (T/K) in the tumor environment
(Supplementary Fig. S4). To investigate the role of IDO expressed by
ovarian tumor cells on T-cell suppression, we generated primary
ovarian cancer cell lines from patients undergoing surgery for
ovarian cancer. We tested the effects of primary ovarian cancer cell
lines generated in our laboratory (e.g., RP-OV-17534) and an

established ovarian cancer line (OV2774) on T-cell proliferation
(n = 3 for each group; Fig. 2A). Because it has been reported that
IFN-g induces IDO expression, we also treated tumor cells with
IFN-g before T cells were cultured in media conditioned by the
tumor cells. T cells were cultured for 4 days in conditioned media
derived from culturing the ovarian cancer cell lines. T-cell
proliferation was higher in ovarian cancer cell line OV2774 and
RP-OV-17534 conditioned media compared with RP-OV-17534
IFN-g–treated and OV2774 IFN-g–treated conditioned media
(Fig. 2A). These findings indicate that conditioned media derived
from IFN-g–treated primary and established ovarian cancer cells
resulted in more T-cell suppression compared with non–IFN-g–
treated ovarian cancer cells. Next, we tested whether the observed
effects of the culture conditions on T-cell proliferation rates were
related to functional IDO enzyme activity as measured by
kynurenine levels in each of the cell cultures. As shown in Fig. 2B,
primary ovarian cancer cells (RP-OV-17534) had IDO activity
without IFN-g treatment whereas established ovarian cancer cells
(OV2774) did not show IDO enzyme activity. After IFN-g treatment,
OV2774 showed significant IDO enzyme activity whereas RP-OV17534 showed further increase in IDO activity. Functional IDO
activity from both cells was inhibited by L-1MT and D/L-1MT,
whereas D-1MT was less efficient in inhibiting IDO activity. Taken
together with the T-cell suppression results (Fig. 2A), the data
indicate that IDO+ ovarian cancer cells also suppress T-cell
proliferation and that L-1MT and D/L-1MT are more efficient than
D-1MT in inhibiting functional IDO enzyme activity from human
ovarian cancer cells.
D-1MT inhibits IDO activity but does not reverse T-cell
proliferation. To verify whether 293IDO showed IDO enzyme
activity, concentrations of tryptophan and kynurenine were
measured by HPLC in culture supernatants (Fig. 3A). In cell-free

media, there was no detectable tryptophan degradation whereas
293 cell cultures resulted in 50% reduction in tryptophan levels
after 4 days. Importantly, the culture supernatants from 293IDO
cells showed that tryptophan was completely degraded into
kynurenine. These results are consistent with the data from our
T-cell suppression assays and provided additional confirmation
that IDO enzyme activity resulted in T-cell suppression in our
coculture systems.
To determine the potential reasons for the failure of D-1MT
to effectively restore IDO-mediated suppression of human T-cell
proliferation, concentrations of tryptophan and kynurenine from
293IDO supernatant cultured for 4 days in the presence of various
amounts of different 1MT isomers were measured by HPLC
(Fig. 3B). Both L-1MT and D/L-1MT were very efficient in inhibiting
kynurenine production by 293IDO cells. Although D-1MT was
effective, it achieved less inhibition of kynurenine production even
at high concentrations. This is contrary to a previous report
wherein D-1MT was shown to be completely inefficient in inhibiting human IDO enzyme activity (18). However, even at this higher
concentration, D-1MT could still not restore CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell
proliferation from normal donors and EOC patients (Fig. 3C). An
examination of tryptophan catabolism by IDO in these cultures
revealed that, even when L-1MT and D-1MT inhibited kynurenine
production to the same degree, they differed significantly with
respect to suppression of tryptophan consumption (Fig. 3C). We
noted about the same amount of tryptophan in the supernatant of
both 293 cells and 293IDO cells cultured in the presence of L-1MT.
In contrast, there was almost no detectable tryptophan in the
supernatant of 293IDO cells with and without D-1MT, suggesting
that tryptophan was completely depleted by 293IDO cells even
in the presence of 1mmol/L of D-1MT. Together, the results
indicate that, whereas the generation of tryptophan metabolites

anti-CD3 stimulation. At 6 d later, T-cell proliferation and cytokines IFN-g and IL-4 expression were analyzed by FACS.

(kynurenine) by IDO is important in mediating suppression of
T-cell proliferation, the degree to which tryptophan depletion is
abrogated by 1MT is also critical in overcoming IDO-induced arrest
of T-cell proliferation.
To confirm the significant role of tryptophan depletion in IDOdependent T-cell suppression, supernatant from 293 cells or
293IDO cells cultured in the presence or absence of different
1MTs for 4 days were collected and healthy donor T cells were
cultured in these conditioned media with or without exogenous
100 Amol/L tryptophan under anti-CD3 stimulation. Six days later,
T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression were analyzed by FACS.
As expected, CD4+ T-cell proliferation was suppressed in 293IDO
supernatant compared with those cultured in 293 cell supernatant
and L-1MT and DL-1MT were more efficient than D-1MT in
restoring T-cell proliferation. Importantly, this reversal of T-cell
suppression could also be achieved by culturing T cells in 293IDO
supernatant supplemented with tryptophan (Fig. 3D). Our data
from Supplementary Fig. S1B indicate that 293IDO inhibited IFN-g+
CD4+ cells whereas there was an increase in IL-4+ CD4+ cells. As
shown in Fig. 3D, this IDO-dependent suppression of Th1 cells was
reversed by both L-1MT and D/L-1MT, as well as exogenous
tryptophan. Again D-1MT was less efficient in reversing suppression of Th1 cell proliferation (Fig. 3D).
IDO+ DC suppresses T cells whereas L-1MT and DL-1MT,
but not D-1MT, reverse this suppression. To further confirm
the potential in vivo implications of our findings in human
ovarian cancer, we extended our analysis to IDO+ DCs. In
previous reports, IDO+ DCs were characterized by coexpression of
CD123 and CCR6 (20). Single-cell suspensions from TILs, tumor
draining pelvic/paraaortic lymph nodes (TDLN) of ovarian cancer
patients, normal donor pelvic lymph nodes (NDLN), and PBMCs
were stained with antibodies specific for CD123 and human IDO,
as described. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, the frequencies
of CD123+IDO+ cells in TILs were higher than in PBMCs of
ovarian cancer patients and normal donors, but PBMCs of
patients had more CD123+IDO+ cells than normal donor PBMCs.
In addition, there was a significant increase in the frequency of
IDO+DCs in TDLNs compared with NDLNs. These observations
suggest that a population of IDO+DCs are generated in secondary
lymphoid organs of ovarian tumor–bearing hosts and at the
tumor microenvironment.
Next, we generated monocyte-derived iDCs from healthy donor
PBLs, induced iDC to mature DCs (mDC) by CD40L and LPS. Some
of the DCs were also treated with IFN-g (hereafter called IFN-DC)
to induce IDO production. Kynurenine analyses from supernatant
showed that iDC had very little functional IDO activity (3.48 F
0.02 Amol/L) and that mDC had some IDO activity without IFN-g
treatment (5.86 F 0.10 Amol/L, P = 0.02 compared with iDC).
In contrast, IFN-DCs had significantly increased functional IDO
enzyme activity (12.8 F 0.26 Amol/L, P = 0.01 compared with iDC),
which was inhibited by D-1MT, L-1MT, and DL-1MT (Fig. 4A).
To determine their regulation of T-cell proliferation, DCs were
coincubated with autologous PBLs and stimulated with anti-CD3
antibody in the presence or absence of different 1MTs. Without
1MT, both mDC and IFN-DC suppressed CD4+ (Fig. 4B) and CD8+
(Fig. 4C) T-cell proliferation (P < 0.05). Whereas L-1MT and D/L1MT reversed the IDO+ DC-mediated T-cell suppression, D-1MT

Discussion
In the present study, we have shown that IDO is expressed in
human ovarian tumors and that IDO is functional within the tumor
environment, as evidenced by lower tryptophan/kynurenine ratios
in ascites of IDO+ve compared with IDO ve tumors. Thus,
expression of IDO in ovarian cancer could be associated with
immune tolerance via suppression of T-cell proliferation, leading to
significant constraints on ovarian tumor immunity. Although we
found no correlation of IDO tumor expression with clinicopathologic characteristics (supporting on-line text), this may reflect the

L-1MT Reverses IDO-Mediated T-Cell Arrest

fact that the majority of patients in our study (92%) had advanced
stage (III and IV) disease. In a previous study, whereas advanced
stage EOC patients with no IDO-specific staining by immunohistochemistry survived without relapse, the survival of patients with
diffuse tumor expression of IDO was only 11 months (8). Therefore,
it is critical to identify IDO inhibitor drugs that may enhance the
efficacy of spontaneous and vaccine-induced immune responses
against human ovarian cancer.
We have also shown IDO-dependent inhibition of CD4+ Th1 and
CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood, ascites, and tumors of EOC
patients using 293IDO cells. This model allowed us to obtain
reproducible results by coculturing IDO expressing cells with EOC
lymphocytes. We observed IDO-specific inhibition of T-cell proliferation from all the anatomic compartments, and this was
concomitant with tryptophan degradation and kynurenine generation. The IDO-mediated arrest of T-cell proliferation from EOC
patients was associated with increased cell death via apoptosis,
reduction in CD3, CD4, CD69 expression, and seemed to preferentially affect IFN-g–producing Th1 cells rather than IL-4–producing
Th2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1–S3). Interestingly, another group
also reported that IDO inhibited Th1 clones, but not Th2 clones (22).
Because IDO does not affect up-regulation of CD25 expression on
T cells, we propose that the inhibitory effects of IDO on human
CD4+ T-cell proliferation are unlikely to be mediated via inability of
T cells to respond to IL-2. Indeed, we observed suppression of T cells
by 293IDO, in the presence or absence of IL-2 (data not shown).
To determine the potential in vivo physiologic relevance of our
findings, we showed that primary ovarian carcinoma cells constitutively show functional IDO enzymatic activity and IDO-dependent
suppression of T-cell proliferation. We also showed the presence of
IDO+ DCs at ovarian tumor sites and TDLNs and the capacity of
IDO+ DCs to mediate suppression of T-cell proliferation. Because
kynurenic acid is a metabolite that is not subject to rapid subsequent
metabolism, it is conceivable that persistently high concentrations
in ascitic fluid of EOC patients could evoke three potential IDOmediated mechanisms for suppression of T cells and NK cells in
EOC. First, the direct effects of tumor expression of functional
IDO leading to low tryptophan to kynurenine ratio in the tumor
environment acts on naive or antigen-experienced cells and leads
to arrest of proliferation. Second, IDO competent DCs in the tumor
environment may also act directly (or indirectly via tryptophan
catabolites) to suppress T-cell and NK cell proliferation. Third, at
the time of antigen presentation to naive, resting T cells in ovarian
cancer draining lymph nodes, IDO-competent DCs might suppress
the initiation of immune responses to tumor-derived antigens.
To select the most efficient IDO inhibitor for future clinical
testing in EOC patients, we examined two stereoisomers, along with
a racemic mixture of 1MT. We showed that L-1MT was able to
reverse the IDO-mediated arrest of T-cell proliferation in all of the
in vitro model systems (293IDO, IDO+ ovarian cancer cells, IDO+
DCs). We also observed that L-1MT and D/L-1MT were more
efficient than D-1MT in restoring T-cell proliferation arrest by
abrogating tryptophan depletion. Whereas previous reports (17, 18)
indicated that L-1MT, but not D-1MT, inhibited human IDO activity,
we found that both L-1MT and D-1MT suppressed IDO enzyme
activity when D-1MT was used at high concentration (z800 Amol/L).
Although L-1MT was able to almost completely inhibit 293IDO
enzyme activity and restored tryptophan concentrations to levels
comparable with cells cocultured with 293 alone, D-1MT (even at
high concentrations) was less efficient in inhibiting kynurenine
production and did not restore tryptophan. We consistently found

www.aacrjournals.org

that the generation of tryptophan catabolites was accompanied by
very low concentrations of tryptophan (<1 Amol/L) when IDO+ cells
were cocultured with T cells in the presence or absence of D-1MT.
On the other hand, lower amounts of kynurenine were generated
when IDO+ cells were cocultured with T cells in the presence of
L-1MT, and significantly higher amounts of tryptophan (>10 Amol/L)
were detectable, indicating the critical need for (a) preventing
on-going tryptophan depletion and (b) reducing the amount of
tryptophan catabolites to efficiently abrogate IDO-mediated T-cell
suppression. In support of this notion, our data indicate that
exogenous tryptophan restored 293IDO-mediated arrest of T-cell
proliferation. Although we have not examined the role of additional
tryptophan catabolites, it is possible that D-1MT also does not
efficiently reverse the generation of 3-hydroxykynurenine and 3hydroxyanthranilic acid and, when combined with tryptophan
depletion, limits the ability of D-1MT from restoring IDO-mediated
arrest of T-cell proliferation.
Whereas our results indicating L-1MT but not D-1MT reverse
IDO-dependent suppression of T cells are consistent with previous
reports (18), a recent study (23) indicated at least equivalent
activity (enzyme and inhibition of T-cell suppression) of D-1MT and
L-1MT. The discrepancy in results might be related to the distinct
biochemical and structural differences between mouse and human
IDO (24). Moreover, IDO2 (25), which is strongly inhibited by
D-1MT, was recently described and shown to be the most active
form of IDO in mice (18). In contrast, whereas IDO2 is expressed by
human DCs (18) and tumors (26), it is functionally inactive and
consequently not affected by 1MT. Indeed, we failed to detect any
IDO activity from human IDO2-transfected 293 cells (data not
shown). Therefore, we could not analyze the effects of different
1MTs on human IDO2 activity and any IDO2-mediated T-cell
suppression. These observations are consistent with the report by
Lob and colleagues (18) wherein human DCs were shown to
express both IDO1 and IDO2, but only IDO1-mediated tryptophan
catabolism. Furthermore, IDO1 activity was blocked by L-1MT,
whereas D-1MT was inefficient. In a more recent study by the same
authors (26), although IDO2 was found to be expressed in human
tumors, tryptophan degradation was entirely provided by IDO1 and
D-1MT did not inhibit the IDO activity of malignant cells. Although
these reports did not address the effect of the different isomers of
1MT on T-cell proliferation, it is clear from these studies and our
data that human IDO2 has little or no functional activity and may
not be critical for human tumor immunity. Taken together with the
recent results by Lob and colleagues (18, 26), we conclude that
L-1MT is more efficient than D-1MT in abrogating IDO-mediated
arrest of T-cell proliferation in human ovarian cancer. The in vivo
effects of D-1MT and L-1MT will still need to be tested in clinical
trials.
