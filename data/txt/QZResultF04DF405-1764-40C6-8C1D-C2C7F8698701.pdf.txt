BACKGROUND: This phase 2 trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab combined with
intravenous fludarabine and mitoxantrone (R-FM) for patients with recurrent/refractory follicular lymphoma who had
high tumor burden according to Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria. METHODS: Fifty
patients were enrolled who had received a maximum of 2 previous regimens, including 1 cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)/CHOP-like regimen but no previous exposure to rituximab, fludarabine, or
mitoxantrone. At baseline, 58% of patients had bulky disease (lesion >7cm), 56% had high-risk Follicular Lymphoma
International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores (range, 3-5), and 22% were refractory. Treatment consisted of 4 courses
of R-FM (rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1, fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 2 through 4, and
mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 2, recycling at Day 28) and consolidation with 2 courses of fludarabine
and mitoxantrone (the same regimen without rituximab). RESULTS: The best response (84% overall response rate
including 68% complete response/complete response unconfirmed) was achieved after 4 courses of R-FM. Response
rates were high regardless of age, refractoriness to last previous therapy, and FLIPI score. After a median follow-up
of 4 years, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 47%, the event-free survival rate was 41%, and the 3-year
overall survival rate was 66%. Grade 3 neutropenia and infections were the most common toxicities and occurred in
72% and 14% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreduction with 4 courses of R-FM was safe and highly efficient in patients with recurrent/refractory follicular lymphoma who had high tumor burden; however, better consoliC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Original Article

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common lymphoma in adults, and patients with advancedstage FL or adverse prognostic features usually are considered incurable with chemotherapy alone. Recently, investigators demonstrated that the addition of the humanized
anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to a first-line chemotherapy regimen improved outcome.1-4 However, most
patients who receive rituximab-containing regimens eventually will develop recurrent disease.
There is no standard salvage regimen in FL. Because
alkylating or anthracycline-containing (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP]/
CHOP-like) regimens are the preferred combination chemotherapies used in first-line treatment, nucleoside analog (predominantly fludarabine-based) combinations
have been investigated extensively in patients with recurrent or refractory FL. In vitro, fludarabine has synergistic
activities with mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.5 In the pioneering reports, fludarabine was
combined preferentially with mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (the FND regimen) or with prednisone for the
treatment of recurent/refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin
lymphoma.6-10 Later, emphasis was put on core combinations of fludarabine with cyclophosphamide (the FC regimen),11,12 possibly because of the larger body of in vitro
data, the promising results observed in patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or concerns that mitoxantrone may increase myelosuppression. Some groups
choose to add mitoxantrone at lower doses to FC (the
FCM regimen) as an alternative.13-16 When rituximab
emerged as an efficient drug in single-agent studies, those
who had pioneering experience with fludarabine and
mitoxantrone chose to add rituximab to front-line chemotherapy17,18 or after chemotherapy19 in de novo, indolent
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, whereas most other teams
focused on the combination of rituximab to FC (R-FC)
or FCM (R-FCM).11,20,21 Most of those trials were quite
heterogeneous in terms of histologic subtypes, disease status, and treatment criteria. Moreover, to our knowledge,
there are no data on the combination of rituximab, fludarabine, and mitoxantrone in a well characterized, homogeneous population of patients with recurrent/refractory FL
that required treatment according to validated, high tumor burden criteria.
In 1999, the Adult Lymphoma Study Group/EastWest Study Group for Acute Leukemia and Other Blood
Diseases (GELA-GOELAMS) Working Group initiated a
phase 2 study of rituximab, fludarabine, and mitoxantrone (R-FM) for patients with recurrent/refractory FL af4300

ter a maximum of 2 previous regimens, including 1
CHOP/CHOP-like regimen but no prior exposure to the
3 study drugs, who required treatment based on Follicular
Lymphoma Study Group (GELF) high tumor burden criteria.22 Here, we report the results from that phase 2 trial
with a median follow-up of 4 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objectives
This was an open-label, multicenter study. The primary
endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The calculation of sample size was based on the primary PFS endpoint. We anticipated a 3-year PFS of 50% and computed
that a sample size of 48 evaluable patients who were
recruited over 3 years and followed for at least 1 year
would provide 80% power at the overall 5% (2-sided) significance level to detect a 3-year PFS rate >30% (null hypothesis, 30% 3-year PFS rate; alternative hypothesis,
50% 3-year PFS rate). The secondary endpoints were toxicity, response rate, overall survival (OS), and event-free
survival (EFS).
The study management was operated by the GELA
coordinating center, which issued treatment allocation by
facsimile after confirming patient eligibility. Case report
forms that were collected at participating centers were
sent to the coordinating center and were keyed in twice
for verification. Outliers and erroneous values were
checked routinely. Queries and on-site monitoring were
used for final validation. No interim analysis was done.
The protocol for this study was approved by the
local or national ethics committees and the national regulatory agency according to French regulatory laws. All
patients provided written informed consent. The study
was registered as a national clinical trial (NCT) at clinicaltrials.gov as NTC00169208.
Patients
Eligible patients were ages 18 years to 75 years who had
histologically confirmed, CD20-positive FL (grade 1 or 2
according to World Health Organization criteria),23 had
developed recurrent/progressive disease after a maximum
of 2 previous regimens (including 1 CHOP/CHOP-like
regimen), and had no previous exposure to rituximab, fludarabine, or mitoxantrone. Patients who had received
high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as consolidation of first-line therapy
were eligible, and high-dose therapy was counted as 1 regimen. In addition, patients were required to have at least 1

measurable lymph node or extranodal lesion and to fulfill
at least any 1 of the following criteria of high tumor burden22: 1) the presence of a bulky tumor defined by either
a tumor lesion with a greatest dimension 7 cm, or spleen
enlargement with a greatest craniocaudal dimension >20
cm, or 3 lymph node sites with a greatest dimension at
each site 3 cm in 3 distinct lymph node areas, or pleural
effusion or ascites, or symptomatic compressive syndrome; or 2) systemic symptoms (fever >38 C for >5
days, drenching night sweats, or >10% weight loss); or 3)
elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (above normal values); or 4) b2 microglobulin 30 mg/dL. Patients
were excluded if they had contraindications to mitoxantrone, fludarabine, or rituximab; clinical suspicion of or
biopsy-proven transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; known positive human immunodeficiency viral
status or active viral hepatitis B or C; and a previous
malignancy (except in situ cervical carcinoma).
Assessments
A pathology review of all biopsy material was performed
after registration by a panel of 3 expert pathologists. Parameters that were used to define the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (lactate
dehydrogenase level greater than the upper normal limit,
stage III-IV disease, hemoglobin <12 g/dL, >4 lymph
node lesions, and aged >60 years) at study entry were collected retrospectively.24 Tumor assessments were based
on computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck, thorax,
abdomen, and pelvis; and patients underwent physical
examinations at baseline, 4 weeks after the fourth course
of R-FM, 3 months after the last chemotherapy dose, every 6 months for 2 years, and yearly thereafter until they
developed disease progression. If patients had a positive
bone marrow biopsy at baseline, then a bone marrow biopsy was repeated only to confirm a complete response
(CR). Treatment responses were classified according to
International Workshop Response Criteria as either a CR,
an unconfirmed CR (CRu), a partial response (PR), stable
disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).25 No functional
imaging methods were used. Blood samples for hematology and serum chemistries, serum immunoglobulins, Tcell (CD3-positive), B-cell (CD19-positive) and natural
killer (NK)-cell (CD56-positive) levels were obtained
before each cycle and 12 weeks after the last cycle. Safety
was assessed by using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class Preferred
Terms. Laboratory and adverse event (AE) toxicity grading was assessed using National Cancer Institute Com-

mon Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0; available at: http://
ctep.info.nih.gov accessed on May 21, 2010).
Treatment Schedule and Dose Adaptation
The treatment schedule consisted of a 4-course induction
with R-FM (rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1,
fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 2 through 4,
mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 2, recycling
at Day 28) followed by consolidation with 2 courses of FM
without rituximab. During consolidation, the FM regimen
was planned at 56-day intervals to allow potentially prolonged hematologic recovery. This schedule with only 4
infusions of rituximab and 56-day recycling after Cycle 4
was based on the data available at the time this study was
designed: First, it was reported that 4 courses of fludarabine
and mitoxantrone (FM) provided shorter disease control
compared with 6 courses at the cost of increased toxicity and
delayed hematologic recovery after Courses 4 through 6.26,27
Second, a preliminary report did not indicate an increased
time to progression after 8 courses of rituximab compared
with 4 courses.27 If patients developed grade 4 neutropenia
or any febrile neutropenia after any cycle, then all following
cycles were given with granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor
(G-CSF) support (filgrastim 300 lg daily was started on
Day 5 and was continued until granulocytes were >1000/
lL for 3 consecutive days). If patients developed grade 4
neutropenia that led to infectious toxicity or delayed neutrophil count recovery (ie, neutrophil count <1000/lL or a
return to the baseline count if patients had bone marrow
involvement) occurred after 5 weeks but before 6 weeks despite G-CSF support, then the doses of fludarabine and
mitoxantrone were reduced by 20%. If patients developed
grade 4 thrombocytopenia or delayed platelet count recovery
(ie, platelet count <100,000/lL or a return to the baseline
count if patients had bone marrow involvement) occurred
after 5 weeks but before 6 weeks, then the doses of fludarabine and mitoxantrone were reduced by 20%. If patients
had a delay in recovery >6 weeks, then R-FM therapy was
discontinued. Erythropoietin support was allowed during
and after R-FM treatment according to the institution’s
guidelines. There was no routine Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) or antiviral prophylaxis.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis.
PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the
date of either lymphoma progression or death from lymphoma. OS was measured from the date of randomization
to the date of death from any cause. EFS was measured

response was estimated from the date of CR, CRu, or PR
assessment until the date of disease recurrence, progression, or death from any cause. Survival functions were
estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and were
compared using log-rank tests. Response rates were compared using a chi-square test. All P values are 2-tailed with
a nominal a of .05. Statistical analyses were performed
with SAS 9.1.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Fifty patients were enrolled on this study at 13 French
institutions between April 2001 and January 2004. Demographics and patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The median patient age was 61 years (range, 3075 years). At the time of inclusion, the median time from
primary diagnosis was 34 months (range, 3-116 months).
Forty-seven patients (94%) had received an anthracycline-containing regimen as part of first-line therapy,

4302

including either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vindesine, and prednisone (CHVP) (n ¼ 6); or CHVP combined with interferon alpha (n ¼ 28); or CHOP (n ¼
13).4,22,31-33 The median doxorubicin dose received was
260 mg/m2 (range,: 75-485 mg/m2). Six patients had
undergone first-line, consolidative ASCT with a conditioning regimen that cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and
total body irradiation (10 grays [Gy]). Six patients (12%)
had received second-line treatment with a regimen that
contained cytarabine and cisplatin (n ¼ 3), or CHVP (n
¼ 1), or chlorambucil (n ¼ 1), or involved-field radiotherapy (2 times 2 Gy; n ¼ 1). Seventy-eight percent of
patients had responded to their last prior therapy (50%
CR/CRu rate), and 22% had refractory disease at study
entry. The median PFS after the last prior therapy was 27
months (range, 3-114 months), and 7 of 50 patients
(14%) had a duration of previous remission <1 year. The
majority of patients had several adverse prognostic parameters at baseline (Table 1). Given the low number of
patients with FLIPI scores of 0 and 1, these patients were
pooled with patients who had a FLIPI score of 2 for the
sake of comparisons with patients who had high-risk

FLIPI scores of 3 to 5. After central pathologic review,
3 patients were classified with grade 3a FL but were
retained in the final analysis, because their outcomes were
reported subsequently as similar to the outcomes of
patients with grade 1 or 2 FL.
Treatment Administration
Overall, 192 of 200 cycles of R-FM and 75 of 84 cycles of
FM were given. All 50 patients received at least 1 cycle of
R-FM. Fifteen patients (30%) did not complete the 6
planned cycles because of disease progression (7 patients)
or toxicity (8 patients), but only 3 patients (6%) did not
complete 4 cycles (2 patients with disease progression after
1 cycle and 1 patient who had persistent myelosuppression after 3 cycles). Across the first 4 cycles, the median
dose intensities of rituximab, fludarabine, and mitoxantrone were 98.4% (range, 78%-102%), 96.6% (range,
70%-102%), and 96.4% (range, 71%-104%) of the designated doses, respectively. Eight patients (16%) had at
least 1 dose reduction. Dose reductions (any drug) and
premature withdrawals because of toxicity did not differ
significantly in patients aged >60 years compared with
patients aged 60 years (P ¼ .85), including those who
underwent previous ASCT. Six patients (12%) required
erythrocyte transfusions (29 packs), and 5 patients (10%)
required platelet transfusions (19 packs). G-CSF and
erythropoietin support were given during 68 of 284 cycles
(24%) and 18 of 284 cycles (6%), respectively.
Survival Parameters and Outcome
Survival parameters at 3 years according to age and FLIPI
score are shown in Table 2. At a median follow-up of 4
years, 28 progressions/recurrences or deaths from lymphoma (56%) have been observed. The median PFS was

Cancer

September 15, 2010

33 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21-50 months)
(Fig. 1A). Thirty-three progressions/recurrences or deaths
from any cause (66%) have occurred. The median EFS
was 26 months (95% CI, 15-40 months) (Fig. 1B). Nineteen patients died (38%) because of lymphoma (12
patients), study treatment toxicity (2 patients), second
cancer (1 patient), or other causes (3 infections occurred
after a subsequent salvage regimen or ASCT, and 1 patient
had a hemorrhagic cerebral stroke during follow-up). The
median OS was not reached (Fig. 1C). In patients who
had FLIPI scores from 0 to 2, the median PFS was 50
months, the median EFS was 40 months, and the OS was
not reached; for patients who had FLIPI scores from 3 to
5, the median PFS was 25 months, the median EFS was
16 months, and the median OS was 46 months (Fig. 2).
Response to Treatment
After 4 courses, 42 patients responded including 34
patients who achieved CR/CRu, 3 patients had SD, 2
patients had PD, and the 3 remaining patients without a
clear response at the end of inductions were considered as
treatment failures. Thus, the overall response rate was
84%, and the CR/CRu rate was 68%. After 6 courses, 33
patients were in CR/CRu/PR, and 29 patients were in
CR/CRu, resulting an overall response rate of 66% and a
CR rate of 58%. Thus, the best response was achieved at
the end of induction with 4 courses of R-FM. After 4
courses, response rates were high regardless of FLIPI score,
age, or disease refractoriness at baseline. The CR/CRu
rate was significantly lower for patients who had disease
that was refractory to their last previous regimen (36% vs
77%; P ¼ .010) (Table 3).
Among the 42 patients who responded at the end of
induction, 21 progressions/recurrences or deaths from

who had histologic documentation at disease recurrence
or progression after R-FM; none of those 4 patients had

Toxicity and Safety Laboratories
Toxicity per patient (all grades) is shown in Table 4.
Grade 3 neutropenia and infections were the most common toxicities and occurred in 72% and 36% of patients,
respectively. Grade 3 infections or febrile neutropenia
occurred in 4% of courses and concerned 14% of patients.
To date, 2 episodes of prolonged, late-onset neutropenia
have been observed, both after Cycle 5, and 1 of those episodes led to death most probably because of infection.
Other grade 3 toxicities that concerned >5% patients
were thrombocytopenia (12%) and anemia (6%). Among
the 18 patients who had infections during treatment, 6
patients had febrile neutropenia, and there was only a single documented episode of Herpes simplex (HSV) reactivation, but no PCP or fungal infection was reported. No
significant changes in T-cell/NK-cell populations or immunoglobulin levels were observed throughout treatment
(data not shown).
Adverse Events and Second Cancers
Twenty-seven patients had 1 AE during the study, and
23 patients required treatment. Nineteen serious AEs
(SAEs) were reported in 13 patients. Seventeen SAEs were
considered treatment-related, including febrile neutropenia (n ¼ 6), cytopenias that required transfusion (n ¼ 4),
infusion-related reaction after rituximab (n ¼ 3), infections (n ¼ 2), severe asthma (n ¼ 1), and arthritis (n ¼ 1).
The remaining 2 SAEs were chylous ascites (n ¼ 1) and

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a phase 2 trial
evaluating the safety and efficacy of R-FM, a regimen that
combines rituximab, fludarabine, and mitoxantrone for
the treatment of patients with recurrent/refractory FL
who require treatment on the basis of GELF-defined high
tumor burden criteria. At a median follow-up of 4 years,
the median 3-year PFS rate was 47%, the median 3-year
EFS rate was 41%, and the median 3-year OS rate was
66% in a difficult-to-treat group of patients. Fifty-eight

percent of patients had bulky disease (lesion >7 cm), 56%
had high-risk FLIPI scores, 22% were refractory to their
last previous therapy, and all had received CHOP or
CHOP-like regimens and had a median PFS of 27
months, shorter than what would expected with such
first-line treatments.31 The best overall response (84%
ORR with 68% CR/CRu) was achieved at the end of
induction with 4 courses of R-FM, and the response rates
consistently were high regardless of age, FLIPI score, or
refractoriness to the last previous therapy with the exception of the significantly lower 36% CR/CRu rate observed
for patients who were refractory to their last therapy
(Table 3).
Toxicity was mainly hematologic, as expected, and
was manageable even in patients aged >60 years. Grade
3 infections were infrequent and occurred in 4% of
courses and concerned 14% of patients. Only 1 patient
died of infection after prolonged neutropenia after the fifth
cycle. There was only 1 documented viral (HSV) reactivation, and no opportunistic infections were observed. There
was no case of secondary MDS, but the median follow-up
of 4 years is still relatively short in this context.
Our results with R-FM in patients with recurrent/
refractory FL who had well defined and broadly recognized high-risk features are consistent with those achieved
with R-FC, or R-FCM, or other fludarabine-containing
regimens, as summarized in Table 5, especially in terms of
overall response and CR rates. The median PFS of 33
months obtained in patients, all of whom were rituximabnaive at baseline, suggests that combining 4 infusions of
rituximab with FM was at least additive and possibly synergistic given the respective median PFS of 14 months
and 12 months reported previously with FM and singleagent rituximab in patients with recurrent/refractory
FL.26,27,34 Despite similar overall response rates and CR
rates after cytoreduction with 4 courses of R-FM in
patients with low/intermediate-risk and high-risk FLIPI
scores at baseline, 3-year PFS and EFS were significantly
shorter in patients with high-risk FLIPI scores (Table 4).
Especially for these high-risk patients, our results do not
really support further consolidation with 2 additional
courses of FM. New concepts, such as rituximab maintenance35 and consolidation with radioimmunotherapy
(RIT),36 currently have emerged in FL. Rituximab maintenance reportedly improved response duration in recurrent patients after R-FCM37; it also has been tested as
first-line treatment after R-FND.38 Consolidation with
RIT reportedly provided high rates of conversion from
PR to CR and significant PFS improvement in the first-

line setting.36 According to our series with R-FM, it may
be an interesting option for patients who failed their last
prior therapy, patients aged >60 years, and patients with
FLIPI scores of 3 to 5, whose CR/CRu rate could be further improved. It is noteworthy that a consolidation strategy with ibritumomab tiuxetan (a radiolabeled antibody)
currently is being tested after R-FND in high-risk FLIPI
patients as first-line therapy.39 Consolidation with highdose therapy followed by ASCT would be a third option
for younger patients. Although there are some reports that
fludarabine combination regimens severely affect peripheral blood stem cell mobilization,40,41 stem cell collection
and ASCT appear to be feasible after R-FND or RFC.12,42 We did not investigate stem cell collection after
R-FM in the current study, in that most of our patients
were not considered eligible for ASCT because of their
age or because they had undergone previous ASCT.
All of our patients were rituximab-naive at study
entry, and the relevance of our results may be regarded as
questionable now that combining rituximab and chemotherapy is the gold standard in first-line therapy for FL. It
is noteworthy that, in the German Low-Grade Lymphoma
Study Group experience, overall and complete response
rates to R-FCM were not modified by previous exposure
to rituximab,43 which strongly suggests R-FM remains an
entirely valuable option for patients who develop disease
recurrence after prior therapy with rituximab.
In conclusion, a 4-course R-FM treatment was feasible, safe, and yielded high overall and complete response
rates in patients with recurrent/refractory FL who had
high tumor burden and high-risk features, and R-FM
should be considered a highly valuable cytoreduction regimen. Two additional consolidative FM cycles without rituximab did not seem to improve outcome, which calls for
further testing of options like rituximab maintenance,
RIT consolidation, consolidative high-dose therapy, and
other innovative options.
