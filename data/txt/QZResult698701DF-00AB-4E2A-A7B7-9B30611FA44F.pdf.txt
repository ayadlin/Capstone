ABSTRACT
Immunotherapies for cancer are transforming patient care, but clinical
responses vary considerably from patient to patient. Simple, inexpensive strategies
to target treatment to likely responders could substantially improve efficacy while
simultaneously reducing health care costs, but identification of reliable biomarkers
has proven challenging. Previously, we found that pre-treatment serum IgM to blood
group A (BG-A) correlated with survival for patients treated with PROSTVAC-VF, a
therapeutic cancer vaccine in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of prostate
cancer. These results suggested that ABO blood type might influence efficacy.
Unfortunately, blood types were not available in the clinical records for all but 8
patients and insufficient amounts of sera were left for standard blood typing methods.
To test the hypothesis, therefore, we developed a new glycan microarray-based
method for determining ABO blood type. The method requires only 4 μL of serum,
provides 97% accuracy, and allows simultaneous profiling of many other serum antiglycan antibodies. After validation with 220 healthy subjects of known blood type, the
method was then applied to 74 PROSTVAC-VF patients and 37 control patients from
a phase II trial. In this retrospective study, we found that type B and O PROSTVACVF patients demonstrated markedly improved clinical outcomes relative to A and AB
patients, including longer median survival, longer median survival relative to Halabi
predicted survival, and improved overall survival via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
(p = 0.006). Consequently, blood type may provide an inexpensive screen to preselect patients likely to benefit from PROSTVAC-VF therapy.

have little or no apparent benefit. Strategies to target
immunotherapies to likely responders would allow
patients to make better treatment decisions, leading
to improved outcomes and reduced health care costs
[1–4]. Unfortunately, identification of reliable predictive
biomarkers has proven challenging.
One promising immunotherapy is PROSTVAC-VF,
cancer vaccine in phase III clinical trials for the treatment
of advanced prostate cancer.[5] PROSTVAC-VF induces
immunity to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using

INTRODUCTION
Immunotherapies, treatments that use a person’s
own immune system to fight disease, are transforming
cancer care. Immunotherapies can provide long-lasting,
durable responses, and several have received U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval recently.
While efficacious, clinical responses vary considerably
from patient to patient. Some patients live years longer
than expected while other seemingly similar patients

PSA and three costimulatory molecules (LFA-3, B7.1,
and ICAM-1) [6]. Although PROSTVAC-VF treatment
was associated with preliminary evidence of an 8 to 9
month improvement in median overall survival in two
phase II clinical trials [7, 8], not all patients experience
improved survival. In a recent study, we reported that
pre-vaccination IgM antibody levels to blood group A
trisaccharide (BG-Atri) significantly correlate with survival
[9]. These antibodies bind to the BG-A antigen displayed
on the surface of the PROSTVAC-VF poxvirus vectors.
The importance of immune recognition of an ABO
antigen raised the possibility that a patient’s blood type
may influence their response to the vaccine; however,
correlations between serum IgM to BG-A and survival
are insufficient to establish a correlation between blood
type and survival. More specifically, correlations between
blood group antibodies and blood type tend to be weaker
for IgM than IgG antibodies and tend to be weaker for
trisaccharides in comparison with larger glycan structures.
In fact, some patients with type A or AB blood have
relatively high levels of IgM to BG-Atri. Thus, we needed to
evaluate potential correlations between survival and ABO
blood type directly. Unfortunately, blood type information
was not available in the clinical records for most of these
patients. Therefore, we needed to obtain blood type
information experimentally. Standard methods based on
agglutination of red blood cells require large amounts of
sera, and DNA analysis requires whole blood [10, 11].

Unfortunately, we only had very small amounts of sera
(5–20 μL) for the PROSTVAC-VF patients from this
study and additional blood draws were impossible as most
patients are now deceased. Therefore, an alternative method
was needed. It should be noted that many clinical studies
and epidemiological studies store only small amounts of
sera/plasma for retrospective analysis. Therefore, new
methods for blood typing that use miniscule amounts of
serum/plasma could be useful in a variety of studies.
In principle, blood type can be determined by
evaluating the presence or absence of serum antibodies to
blood group antigens (i.e., reverse typing). The antigens
that define ABO blood types are glycans that are displayed
on the surfaces of erythrocytes and other cells [12, 13].
Blood group A (BG-A) and B (BG-B) antigens that are
not expressed on an individual’s own cells are viewed as
foreign by their immune system, resulting in the production
of antibodies to the corresponding glycans. While reverse
typing is simple conceptually, identifying optimal glycans
for antibody detection is not trivial [14]. The BG-A and
BG-B determinants are defined as trisaccharides [BG-A
has the terminal sequence GalNAca1-3(Fuca1-2)Gal;
BG-B has the terminal sequence Gala1-3(Fuca1-2)Gal].
As will be illustrated below, the simple trisaccharides
are not suitable capture agents for blood typing with
high accuracy. In nature, however, these trisaccharides
are appended to various carrier glycan chains resulting
in 12 different tetrasaccharides (BG-A1 through A6 and
BG-B1 through B6, see Figure 1). The BG-A and BG-B

determinants are biosynthesized from 6 different blood
group H trisaccharides (BG-H1 through H6, see Figure
1). Previous studies have detected chain type specific
antibodies to BG-A and BG-B glycans in human serum
[15, 16], indicating that chain structure can influence the
ability to capture some antibodies to blood group antigens.
Moreover, the ABH determinants can be presented in
different contexts on the cell surface (e.g., on lipids or
proteins; at high or low density). It was not clear which
structure(s) and presentation(s) would be best for detecting
the relevant antibody populations.
Glycan microarray technology is a powerful highthroughput tool for studying interactions of hundreds of
carbohydrates with a variety of macromolecules [17–20].
Glycan array assays require only tiny amounts of sera/
plasma (2–5 μL) and provide the opportunity to examine
many combinations of glycan structure and presentation
in a single experiment. In this study, we used a glycan
array containing 380 array components, of which 71 are
variations of ABH determinants. IgG and IgM antibodies
to BG-A and BG-B determinants were evaluated and used
to develop a microarray-based method for blood typing.
Next, we applied this method to obtain blood types for
patients in the PROSTVAC-VF study and found that
patient’s blood type does correlate with survival. Given
that blood type can be easily obtained for future studies
using standard methods, blood type may provide a simple
and cost effective approach for selecting patients likely to
benefit from PROSTVAC-VF therapy.

each method, there were two key criteria: the proportion
of subjects that can be classified and the accuracy of those
classifications. Our goal was to optimize both factors
with an emphasis on accuracy over classification rate. To
ensure consistency, sera were divided into three sets (see
Supporting Information, Table S1): a training set (n = 60),
a test set (n = 40), and a validation set (n = 120). The
initial methods were developed using the training set and
then refined with the test set. The best method was then
further evaluated with the validation set.

Antibody profiles from the training set
The training set (n = 60) was used to identify array
components with high correlations to blood type in healthy
subjects. Heat maps provide an overall view of IgG and
IgM anti-glycan antibody signals to blood group A and B
antigens (Supporting Information, Figure S1). In general,
IgG signals were more strongly correlated with blood type
than IgM. Correlations for tetrasaccharides tended to be
better than trisaccharides (see Table 1 and Figure S2). The
strongest correlations for IgG were observed for blood
group antigens with type 1–4 chains (Table 1). For IgM
antibodies, the strongest correlations were for type 2
A and B tetrasaccharides. Overall, stronger correlations
between IgG signals and blood type were observed with
higher density glycans, while some lower density glycans
showed better correlations for IgM. Antibody signals were
not affected by up to three freeze-thaw cycles.
Based on the profiles, 4 of the 60 samples appeared
to have vastly different antibody profiles than expected
based on the listed blood type. These samples, along with
21 other samples, were blinded and then re-typed using
standard methods. Based on the results, all four samples
appear to be mislabeled (see Supporting Information,
Table S2 for details). For the purposes of this study,
we report the accuracies of our method for both the
original assignments provided by the vendor and the new
assignments based on re-typing.

RESULTS
Development of an array-based blood typing
method and experimental design
To the best of our knowledge, blood typing has
not been reported previously using a glycan microarray.
In the first phase of this project, we developed a glycan
microarray-based assay for assigning blood type using
serum samples from healthy individuals of known blood
type. Reverse blood typing involves evaluating the
presence or absence of serum antibodies to ABO antigens.
In principle, individuals lacking a particular ABO antigen
on their red blood cells will have antibodies directed
against it in their sera/plasma, and individuals expressing
a particular ABO antigen will have no antibody directed
against it. In practice, however, selectively capturing
the correct serum antibodies with synthetic glycans is
not trivial. Therefore, an optimal method needed to be
determined experimentally. In particular, we needed
to optimize (a) the number of array components, (b)
the structures and presentations of those glycans, and
(c) the use of IgG and/or IgM signals. The microarray
based strategy allows one to investigate many possible
variations of structure and presentation as well as many
different combinations of 2 or more determinants. For

Initial development and evaluation of blood
typing methods using the training set
Two component systems
The simplest methods for blood typing used two
array components (an A antigen and a B antigen) to assign
blood type. Based on the correlations described above,
about 140 different combinations of two components were
evaluated. For each component, the signals were divided
into three ranges: positive, negative, and unclassified. The
thresholds were varied to optimize accuracy while still
classifying at least 80% of the samples. For all methods
tested, the blood typing accuracies using a two-component
system ranged from about 60% to 90%. As anticipated,
only modest accuracies (57–77%) could be achieved using
the BG-A and BG-B trisaccharides (see Table 2). The best

classification rate and accuracy for a two-component
system was achieved using IgG antibody signals to the
type 3 tetrasaccharides, BG-A3-Oct-14 and BG-B3-Oct-17
(classification rate = 90% and accuracy = 89–93%). In
general, IgM signals provided lower classification rates
and accuracies than IgG. For example, the accuracy
using IgM signals to BG-A and BG-B trisaccharides was
about 57–60%, as compared to 75–77% for IgG. The best
classification rate and accuracy for IgM were obtained
using type 2 tetrasaccharides (BG-A2-Sp-17 and BG-B2Sp-05), with a classification rate of 97% and an accuracy
of 83–88%. Glycan density had a significant impact on
correlations with blood type and success in blood typing.
In general, better sensitivity and specificity was obtained
using IgG signals to higher density glycans, while lower
density glycans tended to be better using IgM signals.

component system using the IgG levels to BG-A3-Oct-14
and BG-B3-Oct-17 and the IgM levels to BG-A2-Sp-17
and BG-B2-Sp-05 was one of the best combinations.
Using this set of glycans, we were able to classify 85% of
subjects with 94–100% accuracy (Table 2).
After evaluating various methods and different
component systems, we found that blood type can be
consistently obtained with highest accuracy using a
10-component system. Blood group A antibodies were
assessed by evaluating the IgM signals to BG-A2-Sp-17
and the average IgG signal to four glycans (BG-A2-Sp-17,
BG-A2-Oct-16, BG-A3-Oct-14, and Globo A-09). Blood
group B antibodies were assessed by evaluating the IgM
signals to BG-B2-Sp-05 and the average IgG signal to
four glycans (BG-B2-Sp-20, BG-B2-Oct-17, BG-B3Oct-17, and Globo B-12). Using this method, we were
able to classify 55 out of 60 subjects (92%) while five
subjects (8%) were not classified. The blood types for all
of the 55 subjects classified were assigned with 93% or
100% accuracy based on vendor original assignment or
after retyping suspected samples, respectively. To further
improve the classification rate, we implemented a second
step (see flow chart, Figure 2) to assign blood types of the
unclassified subjects that uses more stringent thresholds and
fewer glycans. Using the two-step process to assign blood
types for the training set (n = 60), we were able to classify
57 (95%) out of the 60 subjects with 93–100% accuracy.

Three or more component systems
To further improve the accuracy of our typing
methods, we next evaluated about 50 combinations of
three and four components system using both IgG and
IgM antibody levels. In general, the four-component
systems were able to obtain blood type with accuracies
greater than 95%, but many combinations resulted in a
higher number of unclassified subjects given that both
BG-A components and both BG-B components must be
in agreement to assign a blood type to a sample. A four

proportions of each blood type for the PROSTVACVF patients and controls were similar (see Supporting
Information, Table S4), indicating that there were no
major imbalances between these groups in terms of
blood type. For the PROSTVAC-VF patients, significant
differences in survival were observed based on blood type.
Blood type B patients had the longest median survival
(median = 38 months, n = 8), followed by type O (median
= 27.6 months, n = 41), type AB (median = 21.7 months;
n = 7), and type A (median = 15.8 months, n = 24). For
comparison, the median survival for all 80 PROSTVACVF patients in this study was 24.9 months; median
survival for the 37 control patients was 17.9 months.
Given the small numbers of AB and B patients, statistical
analyses with these groups were not practical. Therefore,
we combined type O and B patients together and type A
and AB patients together to form two groups: patients
in which the blood group A antigen is self (A/AB) and
patients in which blood group A is foreign/non-self (B/O).
The median survival for B/O patients was 30 months,
compared to 16.3 months for A/AB patients; the difference
was statistically significant (p = 0.03). These groups were
also compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
(see Figure 3A). Type B/O patients had a statistically
significant improvement in survival (p = 0.006). Finally,
we calculated the odds ratio (OR) that a PROSTVAC-VF
patient would live longer than the median survival for the
full group (24.9 months). Type B/O patients were about
2.5 times more likely than A/AB patients to live longer
than 24.9 months (OR = 2.54; 95% confidence interval,
1.01–6.38; p = 0.047).
Differences in survival can be due to imbalances
between the groups or other factors unrelated to the
vaccine. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the
Halabi predicted survival (HPS) for the groups. The
Halabi model uses seven independent prognostic markers
to predict survival of men with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer treated with chemotherapy [21].
By comparing Halabi predicted survival between groups,
one can assess potential disparities in prognostic criteria
between groups of men. No difference was observed in
the Halabi predicted survival for A/AB and B/O patients
receiving PROSTVAC-VF (see Figure 3B), indicating no
major differences in the extent of disease or aggressiveness
of disease between the groups. In addition to Halabi
predicted survival, we also evaluated potential correlations
in the control patients. Using the Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis, the A/AB and B/O control patients showed no
significant difference in overall survival (see Figure 3C;
p = 0.41) or Halabi predicted survival (see Figure 3D;
p = 0.98). This result is consistent with prior studies
demonstrating no significant differences in survival for
unvaccinated prostate cancer patients based on ABO
blood type [22]. Taken together, these data indicate that
the survival advantage for B/O patients is unique to
PROSTVAC-VF treatment.

Next, our best methods (three two-component
systems, two four-component systems, and one
10-component system) were evaluated in a test set
(n = 40). The rate of classification and accuracy for the
tested methods were similar to that of the training set
(Supporting Information, Table S3). The three twocomponent systems produced accuracies of 85–91%. The
two four-component systems produced higher accuracies
(100%), but the rates of unclassified samples were also
high (17–20%). Using our best method (10 component
system with second step for unclassified samples), we
were able to assign blood type to 39 out of 40 subjects
with 100% accuracy.
Given the success of the 10-component method
in the training and test sets, this system was selected for
additional evaluation in a larger blinded validation set
(n  =  120). Samples from two different vendor sources
were included in the validation study. Out of the 115
subjects classified, 112 were accurately classified (97.4%)
while three subjects were inaccurately classified (2.6%).
Thus, the 10-component system provided consistently
high accuracies and classification rates in each of the
sample sets. Also, there were no statistically significant
differences in accuracy or classification rate between the
two vendors. Therefore, this method was selected for
analysis of the samples from the PROSTVAC-VF patients.

Application of the blood typing method to
PROSTVAC-VF patients
The PROSTVAC-VF samples were profiled using a
smaller, focused array containing all the BG-A and BG-B
determinants. PROSTVAC samples (n = 74) and control
subjects vaccinated with empty vector (n = 37) were run
in randomized order to minimize artifacts due to day-today variation. Using our method, we were able to assign
blood types to 72 out of 74 available PROSTVAC-VF
samples and all 37 controls (see Supporting Information,
Tables S4 and S5). In addition to these assignments,
blood types for eight additional PROSTVAC-VF patients
were available from clinical records for a total of 80
PROSTVAC-VF patients and 37 controls. The proportions
of each blood type from our group were similar to the
expected proportions for the United States population
(see Supporting Information, Table S4), implying that
there were no major problems with the samples (e.g.
degradation).

Correlations between blood type and survival on
PROSTVAC-VF
Next, we retrospectively evaluated potential
survival correlations with blood type in both PROSTVACVF patients and controls. It should be noted that the

Relationships between blood type, IgM to
BG-Atri, and antibody responses to the
Forssman antigen

Overall survival was also evaluated relative to the
Halabi predicted survival as an indicator of the potential
benefit to patients. For each individual, the survival
relative to prediction was calculated by subtracting the
Halabi predicted survival from the actual overall survival
(OS). B/O patients had a median increase in survival of
7.5 months whereas A/AB patients had a median difference
of −1.4 months (p = 0.03). In contrast, the median survival
relative to the Halabi-model prediction in control subjects
did not vary based on blood type (median difference for
A/AB = −2.4 months; B/O = −0.4  months; p = 0.42).
We also calculated the odds ratio that a PROSTVAC-VF
patient would live longer than predicted (OS > HPS). Type
B/O patients were about 2.8 times more likely than A/AB
patients to live longer than predicted (OR = 2.75; 95%
confidence interval, 1.08–6.99; p = 0.033). Taken together,
the data suggest that the primary survival benefit relative
to prediction observed for PROSTVAC-VF is derived
from type B/O patients.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We next compared relationships between blood
type and our previously identified candidate biomarkers,
pre-treatment IgM to BG-Atri and antibody responses to
the Forssman antigen. As one might have expected, pretreatment IgM to BG-Atri had a statistically significant
correlation with blood type (A/AB vs B/O, p = 0.002);
however, IgM to BG-Atri and blood type did not stratify
patients into identical groups. While many of the B/O
patients had high IgM (median = 12.5; RFU on a log base 2
scale) and most of the A/AB patients had low IgM (median
= 9.8), there was some crossover in the patient sets defined
by blood type versus IgM to BG-Atri. In particular, using our
previously determined cutoff for IgM to BG-Atri (RFU on
a log base 2 scale > 13.0), ~10% of the A/AB patients had
IgM signals that were above the cutoff and 61% of the B/O
32251

Oncotarget

patients had IgM signals that were below the cutoff. This
data exemplifies the point discussed in the introduction:
IgM to BG-A and ABO blood type do not stratify the
patients into identical groups. Therefore, one cannot assume
that a correlation between IgM and BG-A will equate to a
correlation between ABO blood type and survival.
Since IgM to BG-A and ABO blood type stratify
patients into somewhat different groups, we next
evaluated whether these two methods for stratifying
patients were complementary. Patients with higher IgM
to BG-Atri tended to have improved survival by KaplanMeier analysis regardless of blood type. While higher
IgM to BG-Atri was associated with longer survival for all
patients, B/O patients lived longer than A/AB at any given
range of IgM to BG-Atri. For example, A/AB patients with
IgM to BG-Atri in the 10–12 range had a median survival
of 20.7 months and a median survival relative to predicted
survival (OS-HPS) of −3.37 months. B/O patients with
IgM to BG-Atri in the same range had a median survival
of 26.8 months and a median survival relative to Halabi
prediction of 7.7 months. Regardless of IgM to BG-Atri
range, there was little survival benefit relative to prediction
for A/AB patients (median OS-HPS ranged from −3.37
to 1.6 months). In contrast, an improvement in median
survival relative to prediction could be observed across
a broad range of IgM to BG-Atri for B/O patients (median
OS-HPS ranging from 7.5 to 10.9 months).
We also examined relationships between blood type
and antibody responses to the Forssman disaccharide.
The Forssman antigen is a xenogenic glycolipid found
on the surface of the poxviruses used in PROSTVAC-VF.
We previously observed that increases in total Ig to the
Forssman disaccharide of 4-fold or greater after 2–3 months
on PROSTVAC-VF therapy correlate positively with
survival [23]. Since the terminal disaccharide of the

Forssman antigen (GalNAcα1–3GalNAcα-) and the blood
group A antigen have some structural similarities (i.e. both
contain a terminal GalNAc-α residue), it was possible
that blood type might influence immune responses to the
Forssman antigen. For example, type A/AB individuals
might be less likely to have an antibody response to the
Forssman antigen and/or have smaller responses than
B/O individuals as a result of tolerance to BG-A-like
structures. Upon analysis, however, the range of responses
and median responses were nearly identical for A/AB and
B/O patients (see Supporting Information, Figure  S3).
Thus, differences in blood type do not explain why some
patients have responses to the Forssman antigen and others
do not. Since Forssman responses occurred equally in
A/AB and O/B patients, we next evaluated whether the
correlation with survival was also independent of ABO
blood type. Interestingly, Forssman responses were only
associated with improved survival for B/O patients. For
example, B/O patients with Forssman responses had
a median survival of 37.6 months, while B/O patients
without responses and A/AB patients with or without
responses had median survivals of 16–20 months. These
differences were readily apparent by Kaplan-Meier
analysis (Figure  4A, p  =  0.003). Similar relationships
were observed for survival relative to prediction (median
OS-HPS for A/AB patients without Forssman responses =
−5.3 months, A/AB with responses = −1.2 months, B/O
patients without responses = −0.7 months, and B/O patients
with responses = 11.8 months). In the control group, blood
type and Forssman response had only minimal effects
on overall survival (see Figure 4B) and survival relative
to prediction. Based on these results, the best survival
appears to come from B/O patients who are treated with
PROSTVAC-VF and produce antibody responses to the
Forssman antigen after vaccination.

DISCUSSION

to bind the BG-A antigen on the surface of the poxviral
vectors that compose PROSTVAC-VF. Since type B and
type O individuals would recognize the BG-A antigen
as foreign and would be expected to have higher levels
of antibodies to the BG-A antigen than type A and type
AB patients, we hypothesized that they might also have
improved overall survival. To test this hypothesis, the
array method was used to assign retrospectively blood
type for 109 prostate cancer patients involved in a Phase
II clinical trial comparing PROSTVAC-VF versus control
treatment. The blood type information was then used to
evaluate relationships between blood type and survival on
PROSTVAC.
Using a variety of statistical approaches, type B and
O individuals demonstrated improved clinical outcomes,
including longer median survival, longer median survival
relative to Halabi predicted survival, and improved overall
survival via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The largest
survival benefit appears to come from B/O patients that
produce an antibody response to the Forssman antigen
after vaccination. The increase in survival for B/O patients
relative to A/AB patients was specific to vaccination
with PROSTVAC-VF. Our results suggest that screening
patients for blood type could potentially provide an
approach to select patients who are likely to benefit from
PROSTVAC-VF treatment (e.g., type B/O patients in this
study were about 2.5 times more likely than A/AB patients
to live longer than 24.9 months and 2.8 times more likely
than A/AB patients to live longer than expected). The
implementation of this approach would be simple and
inexpensive, as standard blood typing methods could be
used for future work. Since blood type distributions are
dependent on geographic location and race, clinical results
may also vary by the location and race. For example,
70% of African-Americans in the United States have
blood type B or O, whereas only 56% of Caucasians have
type B or O. It is important to note that the correlation
has only been assessed in a single, retrospective study;
therefore, additional studies are required to validate this
finding. Given the ease in which this approach could
be implemented in the future (i.e. using standard blood
typing methods), continued evaluation of the relationship
between blood type and survival on PROSTVAC-VF is
warranted.
Lastly, blood group antigens can be displayed
on many different vaccines. For example, whole cell
vaccines derived from human tissue can display blood
group antigens, depending on the blood type of the
original donor. In addition, many enveloped viruses used
as vaccines are produced in cells that can biosynthesize
blood group antigens. Since immune recognition of these
blood group antigens would depend on the blood type
of the individual receiving the vaccine, blood type may
potentially influence responses and efficacy for other
vaccines.

ABO blood type influences numerous aspects of
biology and medicine, such as susceptibility to infection
by various pathogens and potential for complications due
to blood transfusions. While there are a variety of methods
for typing patients, standard methods are not ideal for all
situations. During many clinical trials and epidemiological
studies, small amounts of sera or plasma are stored for
future use. These samples provide a critical resource
for retrospective biomarker discovery/evaluation and
mechanistic studies. In many cases, collection of additional
samples is impossible, and only tiny amounts of banked
sera/plasma are available to an individual researcher.
Therefore, it is crucial to extract as much information as
possible from the limited supplies available.
In this study, we used a glycan microarray to
develop a new method to determine ABO blood types
from serum antibody profiles. Although one might have
expected that reverse typing using synthetic glycans would
be relatively straightforward, achieving accuracies over
95% and high classification rates proved challenging.
The structures and mode of presentation of the BG-A and
BG-B glycans used to capture the relevant antibodies had
a significant impact on the results. Simple trisaccharides
provided only modest classification rates and accuracies.
Tetrasaccharides conferred improved antibody capture
specificity over trisaccharides, but even the best twocomponent tetrasaccharide systems typically provided
accuracies in the 80–90% range. Ultimately, we found
that the best results were obtained by using a panel of 10
BG-A and BG-B glycans, using both IgG and IgM signals,
and using both high and low density glycan presentations.
Using this method, accuracies over 97% and high
classification rates could be consistently achieved. The
accuracies for this method are comparable with standard
methods, such as red blood cell agglutination assays.
Importantly, the method only requires 4 μL of serum and
does not require the use of red blood cells, which have
limited shelf life. We envision that this assay will be useful
for retrospective studies where very limited quantities of
plasma/sera are available or in other cases where standard
blood typing methods are not suitable.
Next, the method was used to evaluate the influence
of blood type on clinical outcomes for patients treated
with PROSTVAC-VF as well as control subjects.
PROSTVAC-VF has demonstrated encouraging results
in two phase II clinical trials and is currently in phase
III trials for treatment of men with advanced prostate
cancer. While promising, clinical responses vary from
patient to patient, and strategies to preselect patients who
are likely to respond well could have a major impact on
patient care. We have previously found that IgM antibody
levels to the blood group A trisaccharide correlate
positively with survival. These antibodies were found

array format and assay have been validated previously
with numerous antibodies and lectins [30–34]. Assay
reproducibility in the context of serum antibody profiling
has also been evaluated previously [25]. The microarray
data discussed in this publication have been deposited in
National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI)
Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO; [35]] and are accessible
through GEO Series accession number GSE68405.

Serum samples
Sera from healthy individuals of known blood
type were purchased from Valley Biomedical Products
and Services (Winchester, VA) (n = 135) and from
Bioreclamation LLC (Westbury, NY) (n = 85). Samples
were accompanied by a certification that all samples were
tested in accordance with FDA regulations and found to
be negative for HIV 1/2 AB, HCV AB, and non-reactive
for HBSAG, HIV-1 RNA, HCV RNA, and STS. The 220
samples consisting of type O individuals (n = 93), type A
individuals (n = 58), type B individuals (n = 32), and type
AB individuals (n = 37). All samples were stored at −80°C
or −20°C until used. For more information, see Supporting
Information, Tables S1 and S2.
Analysis of relationships between blood type and
survival on PROSTVAC involved patients from two
previously reported, IRB-approved phase II clinical
trials of PROSTVAC-VF [7, 8]. Blood type information
was available in the clinical records for 8 patients with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
who enrolled in a single-center phase II study of
PROSTVAC-VF (NCT00060528) [8]. Blood type was
evaluated using our assay for patients on PROSTVACVF (n = 74) and controls (n = 37) from a placebocontrolled, multi-center Phase II study of PROSTVACVF (NCT00078585) [7]. All patients received the same
dose of vaccinia and fowlpox vectors, and the vaccination
schedule was the same, except the subjects in the
multicenter trial received an additional boost on day 14.
Across all study centers, sera were obtained in serum
separator tubes, processed within 4 hours, and stored at
–80°C until assayed.

Statistical analyses
Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed
using Partek® Genomic Suite 6.5 (St. Louis, MO) to
identify BG-A and BG-B determinants that correlated
best with blood type based on the calculated p values.
Survival correlations with blood type were obtained
using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and estimates, and
Log-Rank p values are reported. Comparisons of median
survival and median survival relative to Halabi predicted
survival between groups were evaluated using a twotailed t-test.

Blood typing methods
Blood typing methods were developed using
the normalized antibody signals to BG-A and BG-B
antigens. For two component systems, the BG-A and
BG-B components were systematically varied to identify
optimal pairings. For each component, the signal ranges
were partitioned into three groups: positive, negative,
and unclassified. For example, a signal over 9.0 (RFU
on a log base 2 scale) might be positive, a signal below
8.0 might be negative, and signals between 8.0 and 9.0
would be unclassified. For each BG-A or BG-B antigen,
the thresholds were systematically varied. If the antibody
signals to both BG-A and BG-B antigens were positive,
the blood type was assigned as O. If the antibody signals
to BG-A antigen were negative and to BG-B antigen
positive, the blood type was assigned as A. If the antibody
signals to BG-A antigen were positive and to BG-B
antigen negative, the blood type was assigned as B. If
the antibody signals to both BG-A and BG-B antigens
were negative, the blood type was assigned as AB. If
either signal was in the unclassified range, the blood type
was assigned as “unclassified”. For each combination of
BG-A antigen, BG-A threshold, BG-B antigen, and BG-B
threshold, the classification rate and blood typing accuracy
were determined. Similarly, we assigned blood types using
three or more components. For multi-component systems,
all components had to be in agreement.

Array fabrication, binding assay, and image
analysis
Glycan arrays were fabricated as previously reported
(for additional details, see also Supporting Information)
[24, 25]. Carbohydrates were conjugated to bovine serum
albumin (BSA) or human serum albumin (HSA) to
produce neoglycoproteins prior to printing. Blood group
determinants (A1–6, B1–6, H1–6; each with the “Oct”
linker) were generously provided by Prof. Todd Lowary
(University of Alberta, Canada) [26–29]. BG-A1, A2, B1,
and B2 with a different linker (“Sp”) were also obtained
from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (The
Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). In addition
to variations in structure, some glycans were printed at
different densities by varying the average number of
glycan molecules per molecule of BSA or HSA carrier.
The number following the name abbreviation refers to
the average glycan density (number of glycans/protein
carrier). Averages < 8 were considered low density. The
