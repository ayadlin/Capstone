Is There a Role for Targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor/Receptor Axis in the Treatment of Patients With
Metastatic Melanoma?
Kevin B. Kim, MD

Until recently, immunotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy were the mainstays of systemic therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma. Although interleukin (IL)-2 received approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma from the US
Food and Drug Administration in 1998 for its ability to induce a long-term durable response, it has not been widely used
because it causes severe toxicity but elicits a meaningful clinical benefit in only a small subset of patients. Among cytotoxic
drugs, dacarbazine and temozolomide have been the most commonly used agents; however, the objective response rates
for these drugs are low (< 10%), and the median duration of progression-free survival (PFS) is < 2 months.1,2 The use of
the combination regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma has gained
traction due to its seemingly longer duration of PFS and its tolerability, which have been demonstrated in several multicenter trials,3-5 but to the best of my knowledge this regimen has never been compared with dacarbazine or temozolomide
in a randomized study. The response rate for this combination regimen is approximately 16% in the first-line treatment
setting, and the median PFS duration is 4 months.3
nab-Paclitaxel is an albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel that allows a higher concentration of paclitaxel
for binding and avoids the need for the additive polyethoxylated castor oil. On the basis of its improved clinical benefit
and more favorable safety profile over paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer,6 nab-paclitaxel has been evaluated
in patients with metastatic melanoma. In a multicenter phase 2 study, the response rate of weekly nab-paclitaxel was 22%
among 37 chemotherapy-naive patients, and the median PFS duration was 4.5 months.7 In a phase 2 study of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin reported by Kottschade et al, the median duration of PFS was 4 months and the
median duration of overall survival (OS) was 11 months among chemotherapy-naive patients.8 A large, randomized phase
3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00864253) to compare the clinical efficacy of nab-paclitaxel and dacarbazine
has been completed, and the results will be available shortly.
Melanomas are known to be highly vascular tumors, and their progression is associated with the induction of angiogenesis.9 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and IL-8 are angiogenic factors that appear to play important roles in the angiogenic stimulation of melanoma progression.10 In addition, VEGF has
been implicated in tumor resistance to cytotoxic drugs. In previously reported in vitro experiments, the repeated treatment
of melanoma cells with dacarbazine induced drug resistance and the selection of more aggressive clones through upregulation of VEGF expression.11
Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, was evaluated in patients with metastatic melanoma, but its single-agent clinical activity was found to be only modest in a phase 2 study.12 This disappointing singleagent activity in melanoma is not surprising, because it is the case for most solid tumors except those whose growth is
driven by VEGF signaling, such as renal cell carcinoma. However, bevacizumab has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in various tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, when it is combined
with chemotherapeutic agents.13-15 In patients with melanoma, there appears to be some additive clinical benefit to combining bevacizumab with cytotoxic agents. In a multicenter phase 2 trial, von Moos et al demonstrated that the disease
control rate (objective response and disease stabilization rate at week 12) for the combination of temozolomide and

bevacizumab was 52%, with a median PFS of 4 months,
among 62 previously untreated patients with metastatic
melanoma.16 In a randomized phase 2 study of 214
patients, my colleagues and I demonstrated that there was
a trend toward a superior objective response rate and PFS
and OS durations with the addition of bevacizumab to
the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel, in comparison with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.17
In the randomized, open-label, phase 2 study published in this issue of Cancer, Kottschade et al evaluated
the clinical efficacy of the combination of bevacizumab
with temozolomide (TB) or bevacizumab with nabpaclitaxel and carboplatin (ABC) in treatment-naive
patients with metastatic melanoma.18 A total of 93
patients were randomized in this study, among whom
42 patients and 51 patients, respectively, were treated
with the TB regimen and the ABC regimen. Using
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST; version 1.0), the PFS rates at 6 months and
the response rates were evaluated separately in each treatment arm; the study was not designed to compare the
clinical efficacy between the 2 treatment arms. The
authors demonstrated that for the ABC regimen, the 6month PFS rate, which was the primary endpoint, was
54.9% and the objective response rate was 33.3%; the
median PFS and OS durations were 6.7 months and
13.9 months, respectively. In the TB treatment arm, the
6-month PFS rate was 32.8% and the objective response
rate was 23.8%; the median PFS and OS durations were
3.8 months and 12.3 months, respectively.18
The clinical efficacy of the ABC regimen reported
by Kottschade et al18 is certainly encouraging. In 2 large
multicenter clinical studies, the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel had a response rate of approximately
16%, a 24-week PFS rate of approximately 37%, a median PFS duration of approximately 4 months, and a median OS duration of 9 to 11 months among
chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced melanoma.3,17 However, it is not clear whether the substitution of nab-paclitaxel for paclitaxel in the ABC regimen
contributed to its promising clinical efficacy. In the
randomized phase 2 study of carboplatin and paclitaxel
with or without bevacizumab,17 the response rate was
26%, the 24-week PFS rate was 50%, the median PFS duration was approximately 6 months, and the median OS
duration was 12 months for patients who received bevacizumab in addition to the chemotherapy. When the clinical efficacy parameters of the 23 patients who were treated
with more tolerable doses of the ABC regimen (postAddendum 5) reported by Kottschade et al18 are com478

pared with the study data from the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, no apparent
advantage of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel is noted.
However, the data from these studies do indicate a
possible additive clinical benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to the cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although the
results of what to my knowledge is the only randomized
trial to date to examine the addition of bevacizumab did
not demonstrate statistically significant differences in clinical outcome between the chemotherapy regimen with or
without bevacizumab, all of the clinical efficacy metrics
were found to be more favorable with the addition of bevacizumab.17 Likewise, in the current study by Kottschade
et al, the response, PFS, and OS data in both the TB and
ABC treatment arms were more favorable compared with
historical data for cytotoxic chemotherapy alone.18 On
the basis of the multitude of promising clinical efficacy
results from several clinical studies, a large randomized
phase 3 study to evaluate the true clinical benefit of adding
bevacizumab to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
melanoma is warranted. However, it is still debatable as to
which bevacizumab-containing combination regimen and
which comparator regimen should be used in the design
of the study.
In addition to VEGF-binding drugs such as
bevacizumab, there are a large number of small molecules and antibodies that target the VEGF receptors
(VEGFRs). Sorafenib is one of the VEGFR inhibitors
that have been tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, this multikinase inhibitor was found
to have no meaningful clinical benefit as a single agent
as well as in combination with cytotoxic drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel).3,4,19 The failure to meaningfully
improve clinical benefit with the addition of these
VEGF-/VEGFR-targeting drugs to chemotherapeutic
agent(s) may be related to combining drugs rather
empirically without convincing preclinical models demonstrating a drug synergy. In addition, some of these
VEGF-/VEGFR-targeting drugs may induce various
molecular modulations other than antiangiogenic
actions, which can make the contribution of these
agents to the anticancer activity more difficult to assess.
For example, sorafenib may inhibit the RAF-mediated
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, leading to tumor growth arrest in a subset of patients with melanoma. In addition, VEGF inhibits the differentiation
and maturation of dendritic cells,10 potentially leading
to immunosuppression, and accordingly, drugs inhibiting the VEGF axis could improve the immune

functions, as demonstrated by bevacizumab enhancing
dendritic cell and T lymphocyte proliferation.10
More selective VEGFR inhibitors have recently
been developed and tested. A multicenter, phase 2 study
of axitinib, an oral and selective inhibitor of VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3, demonstrated encouraging
results.20 Among 32 enrolled patients, 6 (19%) had objective clinical responses. The addition of more effective antiangiogenic drugs to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs
or to immune or targeted therapy drugs may potentially
yield superior tumor regression and control, and such
combination regimens, when based on strong scientific rationale and robust preclinical data, should be evaluated.
In the current study, the doses of the TB regimen
(200 mg/m2 of oral temozolomide daily for 5 days and
10 mg/kg of intravenous bevacizumab on days 1 and 15,
every 28 days) were well tolerated, with only 3 patients
requiring treatment discontinuation and 3 others requiring dose reduction during subsequent cycles. However,
in the ABC regimen arm, the original doses (100 mg/m2
of intravenous nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15; 10
mg/kg of intravenous bevacizumab on days 1 and 15;
and an area under the curve of 6 of intravenous carboplatin on day 1, every 28 days) were not easily tolerable,
with frequent  grade 3 hematologic toxicities and fatigue (according to Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 3.0), and the dose of nab-paclitaxel had to be reduced to 80 mg/m2 after the first 28
patients. Despite this dose reduction (post-Addendum
5), a significant percentage of the patients still experienced severe myelosuppression, especially neutropenia.
The safety profile of the ABC regimen is less favorable
than that of the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin,
and bevacizumab.17 If we consider both the clinical efficacy and the tolerability of the 2 regimens, the value of
nab-paclitaxel over paclitaxel is not convincing.
Kottschade et al should be commended for their
effort to identify predictive plasma biomarkers.18 They
found that plasma VEGF-A levels were decreased with 1
cycle of either ABC or TB treatment in a majority of the
patients; however, there was no correlation found
between the changes in VEGF-A or VEGF-D levels and
the clinical response. Therefore, the changes in VEGF-A
with the treatment was neither a predictive nor a surrogate marker for antitumor effect in the study.18 This
lack of correlation underscores the complicated mechanisms of melanoma apoptosis and progression. Although
VEGF has been implicated in melanoma progression
and in resistance to cytotoxic drugs, it is not likely that
the VEGF-VEGF receptor pathway is the major driving

force behind melanoma cell survival and proliferation.
In addition, there are other angiogenic factors, such as
bFGF and IL-8, that play an important role in endothelial proliferation and the resistance of endothelial cells to
VEGF blockage.21 Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of
nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin could have resulted in tumor regression, complicating the correlative analysis of
the angiogenic proteins in this study. However, a robust
tumor and/or blood biomarker analysis is strongly
encouraged in future clinical studies evaluating antiangiogenic or targeted drugs.
In light of recent advances in molecular targeting
drugs, exemplified by vemurafenib, and checkpoint
immunotherapeutic agents, such as ipilimumab, the
future of systemic therapy for melanoma is bright. However, long-term melanoma control is still elusive in the
majority of patients with advanced disease, and we need
more effective treatment strategies. The success of bevacizumab or other antiangiogenic drugs in the treatment of
patients with advanced melanoma will depend on a better
understanding of tumoral neovascularization and its effect
on tumor stromal tissues, as well as on selecting patients
with appropriate relevant biomarkers to yield improved
clinical outcomes.
