BACKGROUND. Patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy often experience chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA), which is associated with symptoms
that reduce quality of life. The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) is a
brief, self-rating assessment scale that measures the severity of core symptoms
and symptom interference with function. The current study used the MDASI to
prospectively assess the correlation between hemoglobin and self-perceived can-

RESULTS. Of 2422 enrolled patients, 2401 received 1 dose of darbepoetin-a.
Eighty percent of patients (95% confidence limit, 78–82 patients) achieved target
hemoglobin levels (11 g/dL) during the study. Patients with a baseline
hemoglobin <10 g/dL had a greater increase in hemoglobin, took longer to
achieve the target hemoglobin, and received more red blood cell transfusions

with moderate to severe MDASI scores (5 points) for fatigue, distress, loss of
appetite, disturbed sleep, and interference with function was reduced during the
study. Improvement in symptom burden was associated with an increase in hemoglobin concentration.

CONCLUSIONS. Treatment with darbepoetin-a at a dose of 200 lg every 2 weeks is
associated with improvement in symptom burden as measured by the MDASI, a
simple tool that may improve symptom management for cancer patients with

anemia and improving overall health-related quality of
life (HRQOL).6–9 Although fatigue has been the most
studied symptomatic improvement related to increases
in hemoglobin concentration, other symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment such as depression, sleep
disturbance, loss of appetite, and pain are associated
with anemia and therefore may improve with darbepoetin-a therapy. For example, increases in hemoglobin concentration are associated with improvement in
depression in patients with cancer10 and in patients
receiving hemodialysis.11 In addition, normalization of
sleep12 and improvement in appetite13 are associated
with the improvement of anemia in patients receiving
hemodialysis. Finally, improvement in the severity of
pain due to improvement in anemia has been reported
in several studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis
as described in a systematic review,14 and animal studies have suggested that erythropoietin protects
against chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.15,16
To improve the HRQOL of cancer patients with
CIA, sensitive, reliable, well-validated tools are being
developed to further improve and standardize the
measurement of anemia-related symptoms and to
effectively manage these symptoms. However, due to
their size and the complexity of scoring, many of
these tools are difficult to administer in the research
setting and are of limited application in general clinical practice. The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory
(MDASI) is a brief, self-rating multisymptom assessment scale that is specifically designed and validated
to measure the impact and severity of self-perceived
cancer-related symptoms and the degree to which
they interfere with a patient’s ability to function.17
The MDASI includes symptom severity items that are
rated on a scale of 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as
you can imagine) and symptom interference items
that are rated on a scale of 0 (did not interfere) to 10
(interfered completely) based on the level of symptom interference with function. The MDASI has been
reported to have several advantages over other symptom-assessment scales in that it 1) contains symptoms caused by cancer and its treatment, 2) is easy
for patients to complete, 3) is easily translated into
other languages, and 4) includes items related to interference with daily life.17–20 However, the MDASI
has not been tested in a broad patient population.
The objective of this open-label study was to
assess the correlation between changes in hemoglobin and symptom burden affecting HRQOL in cancer
patients with CIA treated with darbepoetin-a administered as a fixed dose of 200 lg every 2 weeks. We
examined a subset of symptoms evaluated by the
MDASI (fatigue, lack of appetite, emotional distress,
sleep disturbance, and pain) that may be improved

by increases in hemoglobin and how these symptoms interfered with the daily activities of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of each of the 356 participating centers
and all patients provided a written, informed consent
before any study-related procedures were performed.
Eligible patients were age 18 years, had a nonmyeloid malignancy, and were anemic (hemoglobin level
11 g/dL) due to cancer and chemotherapy. Patients
were excluded if they had inadequate renal and liver
function, were iron deficient, had received erythropoietic therapy within 4 weeks of screening, had
received a blood transfusion within 2 weeks of screening, or had anemia related to factors other than cancer
or chemotherapy. Other exclusion criteria included
acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous
leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, unstable cardiac disease, active bleeding, active systemic or
chronic infection, severe active chronic inflammatory
disease, uncontrolled hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus positivity, history of pure RBC aplasia,
history of positive antibody response to any erythropoietic agent, planned elective surgeries during the
study period, pregnancy, lactating, or known hypersensitivity to mammalian cell-derived products.
Study Design
This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, community-based, 26-week study. Patients received subcutaneous injections of darbepoetin-a at a dose of
200 lg every 2 weeks21 for up to 24 weeks with a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose was administered. Hemoglobin was measured before dosing at
each study visit.
The dose of darbepoetin-a was increased to 300 lg
every 2 weeks if the hemoglobin level had not increased
1 g/dL by Week 4. The darbepoetin-a dose was
reduced to 150 lg if the hemoglobin level either
increased > 1 g/dL in a 2-week period or exceeded
12 g/dL and was withheld if hemoglobin exceeded
13 g/dL. The dose was reinstated at 75% of the previous
dose once hemoglobin was 12 g/dL. Patients were
allowed to receive RBC transfusions as medically
needed.
Symptom severity and interference assessments
were performed weekly using the MDASI. The MDASI
was administered either by an interactive voice
response system, in which patients rated questionnaire
items using the keypad of a touchtone telephone, or in
traditional paper-and-pencil format. Each week,

before they learned their hemoglobin concentration,
patients answered 19 questions regarding the severity
of symptoms experienced in the last 24 hours.17
Included were 5 symptoms (fatigue, disturbed sleep,
distress, lack of appetite, and pain) believed to be
related to anemia10–14 and 6 items related to how their
symptoms interfered with function (general activity,
mood, work, relations with other people, walking, and
enjoyment of life). The other 8 MDASI items were: nausea, shortness of breath, difficulty remembering,
drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, and numbness or tingling.
At baseline and the end of the study, patients
also answered 13 questions related to fatigue from
the Functional Assessment of Cancer TherapyFatigue (FACT-F) scale.22

Efficacy Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the change in MDASI anemia-related scores (fatigue, disturbed sleep, distress,
lack of appetite, and pain) and its relation to a patient’s
change in hemoglobin level compared with baseline.
Secondary endpoints included change from baseline
in MDASI scores related to interference with function,
percentage of patients who achieved the target hemoglobin concentration (11 g/dL), time to target hemoglobin, percentage of patients with a hematopoietic
response (2-g/dL increase in hemoglobin from baseline or hemoglobin 12 g/dL in the absence of a transfusion), percentage of patients receiving transfusions,
and change in FACT-F scores from baseline to the end
of the study. The percentage of patients maintaining
hemoglobin levels within 11 to 13 g/dL was also
included as an exploratory endpoint; a threshold hemoglobin range of 11 to 13 g/dL is recommended by
current evidence-based guidelines.23–25
Safety Endpoints
Safety was assessed by summarizing reports of treatment-related serious adverse events, which included
those that may have been fatal, life-threatening, or
required hospitalization. All adverse events were
grouped according to the affected body system and
by the preferred term within the body system according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA, version 6.0). Severity was assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 in which 1 indicates mild,
2 indicates moderate, 3 indicates severe, 4 indicates
life-threatening, and 5 indicates fatal. Patients were
also assessed for the presence of antibodies to darbepoetin-a at the beginning and end of the study.
Statistical Analysis
The planned sample size of 3000 patients was selected
to encompass a broad range of tumor types. The

1631

mean (95% confidence limit [95% CL]) MDASI scores
related to anemia (fatigue, disturbed sleep, distress,
lack of appetite, and pain) and interference with function (general activity, mood, work, relations with other
people, walking, and enjoyment of life) were recorded
weekly and calculated as the sum of all answers divided by the number of questions answered. The
mean average MDASI scores related to anemia and
interference were also calculated. Symptoms were
categorized as severe (scores 7), moderate (scores of
5–6), or mild (scores <5).17 Prior studies of the severity of fatigue and pain in cancer patients demonstrated that the greatest improvement in symptoms
occurs when symptom scores lessen from moderateto-severe (5) to mild (<5)26,27; thus, the percentage
of patients who had a reduction in scores from moderate-to-severe to mild was recorded weekly. Mean
changes in MDASI scores from baseline were calculated for each incremental change in hemoglobin
concentration (<0 g/dL, 0 to <2 g/dL, and 2 g/dL)
from baseline to Week 13 and from baseline to the
end of study. The effect of tumor response at end of
study on mean change in MDASI scores at Week 13
was also determined. FACT-F scores were calculated
at baseline and at the end of study and are summarized as the mean (95% CL).
The primary analysis set included all patients
who received 1 dose of darbepoetin-a. Baseline
demographics and clinical characteristics were summarized by the number and percentage for categoric
measures and the mean (standard deviation [SD]) for
continuous measures. For hemoglobin-based endpoints, patients were stratified by baseline hemoglobin concentration (<10 g/dL or 10 g/dL). Change in
the hemoglobin concentration was calculated using
the last value carried forward (LVCF) method (missing
hemoglobin values and hemoglobin values recorded
within 28 days of transfusion were imputed using the
last pretransfusion value), and available data (no imputation). The mean hemoglobin concentration was
calculated using available data. The percentage of
patients who achieved a hematopoietic response and
the percentage who received 1 transfusion during
the treatment period were calculated as crude percentages with 95% CLs. The achievement of target hemoglobin levels and the time to target hemoglobin levels
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

were lung (24%) or breast (23%). The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were
similar between the 2 baseline hemoglobin categories (Table 1). Greater than 99% of patients had
received prior chemotherapy, and 14% had received
prior radiotherapy; 35% received platinum-based
chemotherapy.
Patient disposition is shown in Figure 1. Of the
2422 enrolled patients, 2401 provided proper informed consent and received 1 dose of darbepoetin-a; 105 patients (4%) either had a missing baseline
hemoglobin value or had received an RBC transfusion between screening and baseline visits. The number of patients who received darbepoetin-a and had
any baseline MDASI score and any postbaseline
MDASI score was 2249. A total of 1276 patients (53%)
completed the study. The reasons for early discontinuation of darbepoetin-a treatment were similar for
patients in both hemoglobin categories except for

death: fewer patients (7%) died in the 10-g/dL stratum compared with the <10-g/dL stratum (13%).

Darbepoetin-a Administration
The use of darbepoetin was similar for the 2 hemoglobin strata (Table 2). However, 14% more patients
in the 10-g/dL stratum had 1 dose of darbepoetin
withheld.
Efficacy Endpoints
Hematologic outcomes
Darbepoetin-a at a dose of 200 lg every 2 weeks
increased mean hemoglobin in both hemoglobin
strata (Fig. 2). Because of dose titration, mean hemoglobin concentrations were within the 11 to 13 g/dL
range and remained relatively constant between Week
17 and the end of the study (Fig. 2). By the end of the
study, >90% of patients in both baseline hemoglobin
categories had achieved the target hemoglobin level

(11 g/dL) and approximately 80% of patients maintained concentrations between 11 to 13 g/dL (Table 3).
Patients with a baseline hemoglobin <10 g/dL had a
higher mean change in hemoglobin by the end of
study; 1.6 g/dL (95% CL, 1.5, 1.7 g/dL) compared
with 1.1 g/dL (95% CL, 1.0, 1.2 g/dL) for patients in
the 10-g/dL stratum (LVCF approach) (Table 3).
Although the median time to achieve the target hemoglobin level was longer for patients in the <10-g/dL
stratum (10 weeks; 95% CL, 9, 10 weeks) compared
with patients in the 10-g/dL stratum (4 weeks; 95%
CL, 4, 5 weeks) (Table 3), the mean hemoglobin concentration after achieving the target level was found to

be similar in both strata (Table 3). The percentage of
patients achieving a hematopoietic response was
higher when therapy was initiated at a baseline hemoglobin level 10 g/dL (Table 3).
Darbepoetin-a reduced the percentage of
patients in the 10-g/dL and <10-g/dL strata who
required transfusions from 4% (95% CL, 3%, 5%) and
21% (95% CL, 18%, 23%), respectively, in Month 1 to
1% (95% CL, 0%, 1%) and 2% (95% CL, 1%, 3%),
respectively, in Month 6. Of patients in the <10-g/dL
stratum who completed the full 24 weeks of dosing
(n 5 401), 16% (95% CL, 13%, 20%) received 1
transfusion in Month 1 and 2% (95% CL 1%, 4%)

1634

CANCER

received 1 transfusion in Month 6. Thus, reduction
in the percentage of patients who received transfusions was not due to patient attrition (eg, cessation
of chemotherapy before Week 25). The incidence of
transfusions in patients who withdrew from the

study was similar to that in patients who completed
the study (28% vs 25%, respectively).

MDASI outcomes
Improvement in MDASI scores appeared to be associated with mean change in hemoglobin from baseline (recorded at the same time as the MDASI) (Fig.
3). At Week 13 and the end of study, patients with
no increase in hemoglobin demonstrated little to
no improvement from baseline in scores for
MDASI-anemia items and average interference.
Except for pain, an increase in hemoglobin of up to
2 g/dL led to statistically significant improvement
from baseline (based on 95% CLs) in all anemiarelated scores; an increase in hemoglobin 2 g/dL
was associated with further improvement (Fig. 3a
and b). An increase in hemoglobin also resulted in
significant improvement from baseline in other
MDASI items including, drowsiness, dry mouth,
nausea, shortness of breath, and sadness (Fig. 3c
and d). There was little improvement noted with
regard to vomiting and difficulty remembering
things (Fig. 3c and d) and no improvement in
numbness or tingling (data not shown). The
response of tumors to chemotherapy appeared to
affect changes in MDASI-fatigue and average interference scores (Fig. 4a); however, except for
patients with progressive disease, an increase in hemoglobin was associated with improvement in
scores (Fig. 4b).

FIGURE 3. Effect of change in hemoglobin and tumor response on change in M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) scores. Change in average MDASIanemia and average MDASI-interference scores by change in hemoglobin at (a) Week 13 and (b) Week 25. Change in other MDASI scores by change in hemoglobin at (c) Week 13 and (d) Week 25. Note that there were separate sample sizes for each item, and not all patients completed the survey at Week 13 or
Week 25. Bars represent 95% confidence limits (95% CL).

At baseline, a substantial percentage of patients
had average anemia-related scores (30% [95% CL,
28%, 31%]) and average interference scores (35%
[95% CL, 33%, 37%]) considered to be moderate-tosevere (scores 5) (Table 4). As the hemoglobin concentration increased, the percentage of patients with
moderate-to-severe scores steadily decreased (Fig. 5)
(Table 4).
As expected, MDASI-fatigue was the most severe
symptom at baseline, with 63% of patients (95% CL,
61%, 65%) having moderate-to-severe MDASI-fatigue
scores (Table 4) (Fig. 6a). It is interesting to note that

there was little difference noted with regard to the
mean MDASI-fatigue scores between the 2 hemoglobin strata at baseline: 5.43 (95% CL, 5.23, 5.64) and 5.32
(95% CL, 5.17, 5.47) for the <10 g/dL and 10 g/dL
stratum, respectively. As hemoglobin increased, the
mean MDASI-fatigue score improved from moderate
(5.37 points) to mild (3.15 points), and the percentage of patients with moderate-to-severe scores
dropped more than 2-fold by the end of the study
(Table 4) (Fig. 6a). A substantial percentage of patients
also had moderate-to-severe scores for disturbed
sleep (41%), lack of appetite (36%), and distress (32%),

FACT-F by the end of the study; the mean change in
FACT-F score from baseline was 5.4 points (95% CL,
4.5, 6.3 points). The utility of using the MDASI in
patients with CIA was supported by plotting mean
change in MDASI-fatigue scores against mean
change in FACT-F scores (Fig. 7). The correlation
coefficient of 0.606 demonstrated good concordance
between the 2 methods.

and these percentages were lowered over the study
period (Fig. 6a). A less marked decrease in the percentage of patients with moderate-to-severe scores
for pain was observed (Fig. 6a). As hemoglobin
increased, the percentage of patients with moderateto-severe symptom interference with physical activity
(work, walking, and general activity [WWA]) and psychologic items (mood, relations with other people,
and enjoyment of life [MRE]) was also reduced
approximately 2-fold (Fig. 6b). In the subset of
patients who completed the study, there was a similar
reduction noted in the percentage of patients with
moderate-to-severe symptom scores, and changes in
scores for all MDASI items were approximately 2-fold
higher in these patients (data not shown).
The mean baseline FACT-F score for all patients
was 24.6 (of a possible 52 points in the FACT-F scale)
(Table 4). Fifty-seven percent of patients achieved a

Safety
Serious adverse events related to darbepoetin-a treatment were collected; 13 patients (1%) reported such
events during the study. Three patients had cerebrovascular accidents, 2 experienced congestive heart
failure, and 2 reported deep vein thrombosis. No
patients died as a result of treatment with darbepoetin-a. Darbepoetin-a was withheld from 30% of
patients in the <10-g/dL hemoglobin stratum and
44% of patients in the 10-g/dL stratum because
their hemoglobin level exceeded 13 g/dL. Overall, 3%
of patients whose hemoglobin exceeded 13 g/dL did
not have a dose withheld; these patients did not
report serious adverse events. One patient who had a
serious adverse event had 3 doses withheld because
their hemoglobin exceeded 13 g/dL.
No neutralizing antibodies to darbepoetin-a
were detected in any patient.

DISCUSSION
The MDASI is a brief, easy-to-use tool that has been
developed and validated for the assessment of symptoms experienced by patients with cancer.17–20 To
our knowledge, the current study is the first large
clinical trial to use the MDASI to assess changes in
symptom burden and HRQOL in cancer patients
with CIA, and the first time the MDASI has been
used within the same patient population during the
course of their treatment.
In this study, darbepoetin-a administered at a
dose of 200 lg every 2 weeks to cancer patients with
CIA increased hemoglobin concentrations to within
the range recommended by current guidelines,23–25
and the increase in hemoglobin was associated with
a reduction in the incidence of RBC transfusions.
The dose of darbepoetin-a was titrated so that hemoglobin concentration did not exceed 13 g/dL (currently, the labeling for darbepoetin-a recommends
that hemoglobin should not exceed 12 g/dL29). This
strategy enhances the patient risk/benefit ratio
because the maximum gain in HRQOL occurs at a
hemoglobin concentration of 12 g/dL (range, 11–13
g/dL),30 and high hemoglobin concentrations have
been associated with safety concerns.31,32 In the

current study, there were no treatment-related deaths
reported, and fewer than 1% of patients reported
treatment-related thromboembolic events.
Patients with a baseline hemoglobin level <10
g/dL experienced benefits from darbepoetin-a therapy that were similar to those of patients with a
baseline hemoglobin level 10 g/dL. However, these

patients took longer to achieve the target hemoglobin and a higher percentage received transfusions.
The differences in response to treatment with darbepoetin-a between patients with mild versus those
with more severe anemia observed in this and other
studies33,34 suggests that intervention at higher hemoglobin levels may result in increased clinical benefit for patients with CIA.
As expected, fatigue was the most severe anemiarelated symptom reported by patients at baseline, and
the association between improvement in fatigue and
an increase in hemoglobin (within the recommended
range) has been documented in previous studies.6,8,9,35 Improvement in hemoglobin was also
associated with improvements in physical functioning, sleep, and appetite, and in psychologic items
including distress and mood. Positive associations
between hemoglobin, distress, appetite, and sleep
and between fatigue, depression, sleep, and functional
status have been demonstrated previously.12,13,35–38
Pain was not improved by increasing hemoglobin
levels. The selection of pain as an MDASI-anemia
item was based, in part, on animal studies suggesting
that erythropoietin protects against chemotherapyinduced neuropathy.15,16 Thus, it is possible that
relatively few patients in this population had a neuropathic basis for their pain. The lack of change in pain
ratings, however, suggests that changes in other items
were symptom-specific and not a response set to
report improved symptom scores over time.

Our prespecified anemia-related symptoms were
selected from previously reported symptom reductions with correction in anemia. It is not surprising
that other symptoms responded as well, including
shortness of breath (clearly anemia-related), drowsiness (related to fatigue), or sadness (with prior studies showing improvement in depression as anemia
is corrected10). Further research on the components
of symptom burden that may be responsive to a correction of anemia is warranted, including the use of
scales such as the MDASI that ask the patient to rate

the severity of a number of cancer-related symptoms.
A growing area of research suggests that groups of
symptoms cluster together in their temporal patterns
in response to treatment,39 and that there may be
common biologic mechanisms (such as inflammation) underlying multiple symptom expression.40
The results of this study were not influenced by
the number of patients who did not complete 24
weeks of dosing; the reduction in the percentage of
patients with moderate-to-severe symptom scores
over the study period was similar in the total study
population and in the subset of patients who completed the study. Likewise, although patients whose
tumors responded to chemotherapy (complete and
partial tumor response) had greater improvement in
MDASI-fatigue and MDASI-interference than patients
with stable or progressive disease, improvement in
these scores appeared to be dependent on the incremental change in hemoglobin from baseline. This
observation is consistent with data from an epoetina clinical trial that indicated improvement in quality
of life was independent of tumor response.41
Physicians may have limited time to evaluate
symptoms in the clinic. The interactive voice response
system used to administer the MDASI provides a quick,
real-time assessment of self-perceived symptoms and
avoids problems associated with data collection. In a
systematic review of 21 validated multiple symptom
assessment instruments for use with cancer patients,42
the MDASI was highly rated in terms of flexibility, reliability and validity, ease of completion, and utility in

symptom management. The association between
change in MDASI-fatigue and change in FACT-F supports the utility of the MDASI in patients with CIA.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
demonstrated that the MDASI tool can be used effectively to simply and reliably assess a broad range of
symptoms that contribute to symptom burden and
reduced HRQOL in cancer patients with CIA. The
more widespread application of the MDASI in clinical practice could lead to improved symptom management for cancer patients with CIA.
