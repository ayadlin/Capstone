ABSTRACT
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in the development of
leiomyosarcomas (LMSs). In this study, we tested the efficacy of dual PI3K/mTOR
(BEZ235), PI3K (BKM120) and mTOR (everolimus) inhibitors in three human LMS
cell lines. In vitro and in vivo studies using LMS cell lines showed that BEZ235 has a
significantly higher anti-tumor effect than either BKM120 or everolimus, resulting in a
greater reduction in tumor growth and more pronounced inhibitory effects on mitotic
activity and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Strikingly, BEZ235 but neither BKM120 nor
everolimus markedly enhanced the ERK pathway. This effect was reproduced by the
combination of BKM120 and everolimus, suggesting the involvement of mTORC2 via
a PI3K-independent mechanism. Silencing of RICTOR in LMS cells confirmed the role
of mTORC2 in the regulation of ERK activity. Combined treatment with BEZ235 and
GSK1120212, a potent MEK inhibitor, resulted in synergistic growth inhibition and
apoptosis induction in vitro and in vivo. These findings document for the first time that
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition in leiomyosarcomas suppress a negative feedback loop
mediated by mTORC2, leading to enhanced ERK pathway activity. Thus, combining a
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor with MEK inhibitors may be a relevant approach to increase
anti-tumor activity and prevent drug resistance in patients with LMS.

INTRODUCTION

deletions [5–9]. Among these regions, a large region
of deletion on chromosome 10 encompassing PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin homolog), a tumor suppressor
gene and negative regulator of phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K), is one of the most frequent aberrations (40–50%
of cases). Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies have
highlighted the critical role of the PI3K/mTOR pathway
in smooth muscle transformation and LMS development
[10]. In these studies, mTOR inhibition was associated
with significant anti-tumor activity [11]. These data have
been recently confirmed in the clinical setting by a pilot
study of patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma who
were treated with temsirolimus with significant benefit
[12]. Moreover, immunohistochemical evaluation of
the downstream target of mTOR, phosphorylated S6
ribosomal protein (p-S6RP), has been correlated with an

Leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) are an uncommon group
of malignant tumors composed of cells that show distinct
smooth muscle differentiation and that represent 15–20%
of all soft-tissue sarcomas, making LMS one of the most
frequent sarcoma subtypes [1]. The current interventions
for leiomyosarcoma include surgical excision, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy with an aggressive approach taken for
high-grade tumors [2]. However, the prognosis is poor,
with up to 40% of patients experiencing metastatic relapse
despite optimal locoregional treatment [3, 4]. Further
options for the treatment of LMSs are needed.
From a genetic point of view, LMSs are
characterized by numerous genomic alterations, which
include multiple regions of genomic amplifications and

early clinical response to mTOR inhibitors (AP23573)
administered either alone or in combination to a cohort
of patients with varying types of sarcomas [13]. However,
several studies have shown that inhibition of mTOR by
rapamycin and its analogs is associated with a loss of
negative feedback control of the MAPK pathway [14]
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in solid tumors [15, 16].
This finding may explain the transient benefit observed
with mTOR inhibitors in a clinical setting and the need for
more potent strategies to target this pathway [17].
PI3K and mTOR both belong to the PI3K-related
kinase superfamily and share structural domains.
Consequently, certain inhibitory compounds target both
kinases [18]. Dual inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR target
the active sites of both holoenzymes to inhibit the pathway
both upstream and downstream of AKT, thus avoiding the
problem of AKT activation following abolition of the
mTORC1-S6K-IRS-1 or S6K-mTORC2-AKT negative
feedback loops. This aberrant activation is known to
occur with rapalogs such as sirolimus, everolimus and
temsirolimus [15, 16, 19]. Moreover, a recent pre-clinical
study has shown favorable selective activity of these
inhibitors in LMS cell lines [20]. Here, we report an
original study investigating the effects of dual inhibition
of PI3K and mTOR in human leiomyosarcomas on antitumor activity, especially the biological consequences on
components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MEK/
ERK pathways.

decrease in colony formation in the clonogenic assays
upon exposure to BEZ235 compared with either BKM120
or everolimus (Figure 2B). Compared to cells with
untreated medium (control), colony formation by IB112,
IB134 and IB136 cells was reduced approximately 60%
after treatment with BEZ235 at its IC50 value (Figure 2C),
while cells exhibited a range of 10–20% (with BKM120)
and 30–45% (with everolimus) inhibition of colony
formation (Figure 2C). Interestingly, we failed to detect
any significant induction of apoptosis in LMS cells
with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors at the same
concentration (Figure 3B). Only exposure to high doses
of BEZ235 and BKM120 led to induction of apoptosis
as revealed by 40% and 65% increases in the percentage
of annexin V- and PI-positive cells compared to control
cells (Figure 3A and 3B). No effect was observed with
everolimus.

BEZ235 induced ERK pathway activation
We further explored the capacity of these drugs
to inhibit downstream kinases of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway by western blotting using phosphorylation of
both AKT and S6RP as a marker of pathway activation.
Consistent with the proliferation results, BEZ235 was
most effective in inhibiting p-S6RPS240/244 in the 3 LMS
cell lines. This observation indicated a more complete
blockade that was quickly achieved and sustained with
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition (Figure 4A). As expected
and described in several studies, everolimus enhanced
p-AKTS473 accumulation consequent to suppression of
the S6K-mTORC2-AKT feedback loop [19]. Strikingly,
BEZ235 markedly induced ERK activation, while
this effect was not observed with either BKM120 or
everolimus (Figure 4A and 4B). However, we wondered
whether the combination of BKM120 and everolimus
could reproduce the accumulation of p-ERKT202/Y204
observed with BEZ235 treatment. Synergy between
BKM120 and everolimus was observed on LMS cell
line growth, with median combination indices of 0.62 for
IB112, 0.1 for IB134 and 0.1 for IB136 (Supplementary
Figure S1A), and on apoptosis induction only for the
IB136 cell line, with an increase in the percentage of
annexin V- and PI-positive cells (30%) compared with
monotherapy (20% for BKM120 and 13% for everolimus;
Supplementary Figure S1B and S1C). Interestingly, dual
inhibition of PI3K and mTORC1 by the combination of
BKM120 and everolimus mimicked the effects of BEZ235
to induce MAPK pathway activation (Supplementary
Figure S1D). Considering the similar effect on MAPK
pathway activation observed with BEZ235, we
hypothesized that p-ERKT202/Y204 accumulation could be
caused by a feedback mechanism implicating RICTOR, a
scaffold protein from the mTORC2 complex that is known
to be regulated by S6K1 [19].

RESULTS
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors inhibited
proliferation and caused apoptosis in LMS cell
lines
For the purposes of this study, we used three LMS
cell lines derived from surgical specimens obtained from
consenting patients. All patient tumors displayed the loss
of PTEN expression and strong p-S6RPS240/244 staining
indicating sustained overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway (Figure 1). LMS cells derived from
patient tumors showed similar p-S6RPS240/244 staining,
but in the absence of endothelial cells in the LMS cell
line pellets, interpretation of PTEN staining could not
be performed (Figure 1). We assessed the respective
anti-tumor activity of the following PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway inhibitors: BEZ235 (dual inhibitor of PI3K,
mTORC1 and mTORC2), BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor)
and everolimus (mTORC1 inhibitor). We observed dosedependent growth suppression that was more strongly
induced in all cell lines by BEZ235 (IC50 range, 0.001 to
0.1 µM) than by either BKM120 or everolimus (range,
0.01 to 1.6 µM; Figure 2A). Additionally, after treatment
with the respective IC50 values of inhibitors for 72 hours,
all leiomyosarcoma cell lines exhibited a significant

significant changes in animal weight (data not shown).
The number of tumor cells positive for Ki-67, a cell
proliferation marker, was substantially lower in tumors
treated with BEZ235 compared with control tumors
(Figure 5B). With regard to the cellular pathway involved,
as shown in the representative immunohistochemistry
images, tumor xenografts from the BEZ235-treated group
showed a marked decrease in the number of p-S6RPS240/244positive cells compared with the other groups. Therefore,
these pharmacodynamic assessments confirmed the in
vitro activity of the drugs in terms of proliferation and
pathway inhibition.

These in vitro findings prompted us to examine the
effect of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors on LMS
tumor growth. For the in vivo study, BKM120 was replaced
with GDC-0941, another PI3K inhibitor. IB136 xenografts
were established and grew to a size of 100 mm3, after
which either vehicle or drugs were given 5 days a week
for 3 weeks. The growth suppression induced by BEZ235
was more significant in LMS xenografts (Figure  5A).
The average inhibition tumor growth (ITG) of tumors
from the BEZ-treated animals was 65%, whereas those
from the GDC-0941 and everolimus groups were 27%
(p < 0.05) and 54% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared to
the control group (p < 0.05). No apparent toxicity events
were observed in the drug-treated animals. There were no

RICTOR, an essential and specific component of
mTORC2. As expected, RNAi did not alter the kinase
expression of AKT and S6RP and resulted in a 50–90%
decrease of RICTOR protein expression levels compared
to non-targeting RNAi in LMS cell lines (Figure 6A and
quantification in Figure 6B for IB134; Supplementary
Figure S2 for IB112 and IB136). Additionally, silencing of
RICTOR did not disrupt mTORC1/S6K activity as scored
by p-S6RPS240/244 but abolished AKT phosphorylation on
Ser473, a modification mediated by mTORC2. Interestingly,
in RICTOR-silenced LMS cells, we showed p-ERKT202/
Y204
accumulation similar to the enhancement caused
by BEZ235 treatment (Figure 6A and quantification
in Figure 6B for IB134; Supplementary Figure S2 for
IB112 and IB136). Transfection with RNAi (AM1670839500, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) targeting
a different region of RICTOR mRNA also resulted in
accumulated p-ERKT202/Y204 (data not shown). Thus, these
results confirmed our hypothesis that mTORC2 is involved
in MAPK pathway activation.

We showed that BEZ235 induced an accumulation
of p-ERKT202/Y204 protein, a marker of MAPK pathway
activation. The crosstalk between the PI3K and MAPK
pathways has long been known. In fact, PI3K and mTOR
blockade may result in the activation of compensatory
pathways of MAPK that could potentially reduce the
anti-tumor effects of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors [21]. Thus,
we decided to further investigate the effects of combined
targeting of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
cascades in leiomyosarcoma cells. To this end, we
administered a diagonal constant ratio combination design
of BEZ235 and GSK1120212, a potent MEK inhibitor,
in LMS cell lines according to the Chou and Talalay
proposition [22]. In vitro synergy was observed with
BEZ235 in association with GSK1120212 on the growth
of LMS cell lines with median combination indices of 0.72
for IB112, 0.25 for IB134 and 0.4 for IB136 (Figure 7A)

and on apoptosis induction with an increase in the
percentage of annexin V- and PI-positive cells (range of
apoptotic cells, 44–66%) compared with either drug alone
(range of apoptotic cells, 10–27% for BEZ235 and 23–41%
for GSK1120212) as shown in Figure 7B and 7C.
Additionally, after exposure at the IC50 value for 72 hours,
GSK1120212 was effective in inhibiting p-ERKT202/Y204
in all LMS cell lines, and as expected, due to presence
of crosstalk between the PI3K and MAPK pathways,
we observed p-AKTS473 accumulation consequent to
the suppression of MAPK pathway activity (Figure 7C)
[16]. This treatment combined with BEZ235 prevented
ERK and AKT over-activation induced by BEZ235 and
GSK1120212 alone, respectively (Figure 7C).
Moreover, we tested whether the MAPK pathway
blockade could enhance the anti-tumoral effect of the
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in vivo. IB136 xenografts
were established and grew to a size of 100 mm3, after
which either vehicle or drugs were given 5 days a
week for 3 weeks. The BEZ235 and GSK1120212
combination group showed a stronger anti-tumor effect
with a significant (p < 0.001) reduction of tumor growth
(average tumor volume at endpoint, 428.5 ± 70.2 mm3)
compared with either drug alone (1193.9 ± 112.1 mm3
for BEZ235 and 910.5 ± 143.1 mm3 for GSK1120212)
or vehicle (1591 ± 90.8 mm3) as shown in Figure 8A.
Also, the survival of mice (from the first day of the

experiment until the day when the tumor size doubled)
showed that the combination treatment highly significantly
slowed the rate of tumor growth (9.4 days for median
survival) compared to the control (5.8 days) and to the
individual drug (6.4 days) treatment groups (p < 0.0001)
as shown in Figure 8B. No apparent toxicity events were
observed in the drug-treated animals. There were no
significant changes in animal weight (data not shown).
Further analyses by immunohistochemical experiments
showed that the number of tumor cells positive for Ki-67
was substantially less in LMS tumors treated with the
combination treatment compared with tumors treated with
either drug alone or control tumors (Figure 8C).

DISCUSSION
We report an original study assessing the respective
in vitro and in vivo effects of a drug panel targeting
different components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
on human leiomyosarcoma, an extremely rare form
of cancer. This pathway is one of the most frequently
dysregulated signaling cascades in cancer [23]. One
challenge related to the development of anti-cancer drugs
targeting this signaling cascade is to identify agents
capable of achieving sufficiently strong inhibition of the
pathway (and the subsequent anti-tumor activity). Dual
inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, such as BEZ235, target the

active sites of both holoenzymes, inhibiting the pathway
both upstream and downstream of AKT and avoiding the
problem of AKT activation following the abolition of the
mTORC1-S6K-IRS-1 negative feedback loop [24]. The
loss of this feedback loop is known to occur with rapalogs,
the first PI3K pathway-targeted agents approved for the
treatment of cancer. Dual inhibitors are also expected
to be more active than pan-PI3K inhibitors, particularly
in tumors with alterations downstream of PI3K and
upstream of mTOR (e.g., PTEN or TSC1/2), such as LMS
[25]. We have demonstrated that dual inhibition of PI3K
and mTOR is associated with strong anti-tumor activity
in LMS, which was significantly higher than that of
either mTOR inhibition (everolimus) or PI3K inhibition
(BKM120) alone. Viability changes were reflected in the
apoptotic effects produced by BEZ235, while apoptosis
was not observed with everolimus, indicating that PI3K is
sufficient for cell survival.
Another important challenge for the development
of drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is the
elucidation of acquired resistance mechanisms that either
restore PI3K signaling or activate parallel pathways in the
presence of inhibitors. The existence of redundancy and
feedback loops between the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling networks is undisputed [26].
mTOR nucleates two distinct multi-protein complexes,
the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex
2 (mTORC2). In contrast to mTORC1, for which many
upstream signals and cellular functions have been defined,
relatively little is known about mTORC2 biology. Several
studies have shown that mTORC2 plays key roles in
various biological processes including cell survival,

metabolism, proliferation and cytoskeletal organization
[27]. It has been shown that allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors
such as everolimus can lead to activation of the ERK
pathway as a result of a PI3K-dependent mechanism,
thus adding a new level of complexity to the previously
described negative feedback loop involving mTORC1/
PI3K/AKT [14]. We found that the dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235 profoundly inhibits mTORC1,
mTORC2, and PI3K but induces overactivation of the
RAS/MEK/ERK pathway in LMS cells. To understand
the mechanism by which dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors such
as BEZ235 promoted ERK activation, we determined the
role of the previously described feedback loop involving
mTORC1/S6K/PI3K/ERK in response to rapamycin
analogs [15, 16]. Neither mTORC1 inhibition (everolimus)
nor PI3K inhibition (BKM120) at concentrations that
completely blocked the mTORC1/S6K axis produced any
detectable enhancement of ERK activation in LMS cells,
suggesting a PI3K-independent mechanism. Strikingly,
we observed that the combination of BKM120 and
everolimus induced MAPK pathway activation similar
to BEZ235, raising the possibility that this activation
was the result of the suppression of a negative feedback
loop involving mTORC2. Indeed, S6K1 (activated
by mTORC1) and TSC1/2 (inhibited by PI3K/AKT)
negatively and positively regulate mTORC2, respectively
[28]. To confirm this hypothesis, we used RNAi to silence
RICTOR, a scaffold protein in the mTORC2 complex.
We observed that knockdown of RICTOR increased the
baseline levels of ERK phosphorylation similar to BEZ235
treatment (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S2).
Therefore, we showed that dual inhibition of PI3K/mTOR

suppresses a PI3K-independent feedback loop involving
mTORC2 and results in MAPK pathway activation in
LMS cells. Interestingly, an identical finding was reported
in a pancreatic cancer model, suggesting a common effect
for different malignancies [29].
Given the overactivation of the RAS/MEK/ERK
pathway induced by BEZ235, we investigated whether this
effect could counterbalance the growth-suppressive action
of dual mTOR/PI3K inhibition in LMS cells. We found
that the use of the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 abrogated
the effect of BEZ235 on p-ERKT202/Y204 accumulation,
resulting in a synergistic increase in LMS cell apoptosis

and significantly higher inhibition of tumor growth.
Thus, in addition to the cytostatic effect, this multidrug
combination exerted cytotoxic effects (Figure 7). This
result is in agreement with that from Soares et al.,
who showed that MEK1/2 inhibition suppressed the
enhanced ERK activation induced by PI3K/mTOR
dual inhibitors and enhanced the effects of growth
inhibition due to BEZ235 in pancreatic cancer cells.
Importantly, we were able to confirm our in vitro findings
in vivo with a statistically significant greater anti-tumor
effect of the BEZ235 and GSK1120212 combination
versus the same agents used as monotherapies (Figure 8).

There are few examples of the successful use
of targeted inhibitors to disrupt the aberrant signaling
pathways that malignant mesenchymal tumors require
for continued growth. These examples include imatinibmediated inhibition of c-KIT in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors [30], inhibition of PDGFR-β (plateletderived growth factor receptor) by imatinib in
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [31], mTOR inhibition
in perivascular epithelioid cell tumors [32] and EZH2
(enhancer of zeste homolog 2) inhibition in INI1-or
SMARCA4-deficient sarcomas [33]. Our pre-clinical
results suggest that dual targeting of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway in combination with MAPK inhibition is
a promising therapeutic strategy against leiomyosarcoma.

[34]. Authentication of the cell lines was performed using
aCGH by comparing the cell line with the corresponding
originating tumor. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium, GlutaMAXTM Supplement (Sigma-Aldrich
Life Technologies, Saint Louis, MO, USA) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and 0.2% Normocin (InvivoGen, Toulouse,
France) at 37°C in an environment containing 5% CO2.
Cells were routinely passaged every 2 to 3 days.

(PI3K inhibitor), everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and

as 2.1 mmol/L, 24 mmol/L, 10 mmol/L and 14 mmol/L

period, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and 3–4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, SigmaAldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) were immediately
added to the wells at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL,
and the cells were incubated for 3 hours. Then, the
supernatant was discarded, 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France)
was added, and the absorbance was monitored using a
Flexstation 3 Plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 570 nm
with 630 nm as a reference. The half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) was calculated with GraphPad Prism
software version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA, USA). Each experiment was repeated at least
3 times.

polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Blots were probed
overnight at 4°C in 5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in
PBST (phosphate, 100 mM; KCl, 27 mM; NaCl, 1.37 M,
pH 7.4 after 1X dilution; 0.1% Tween-20) with primary
antibodies (diluted 1:1000) to p-AKTser473 (CST 4060),
AKT (CST 4685), p-S6RPser240/244 (CST 2215), S6RP (CST
2217), p-ERK1/2thr202/tyr204 (CST 4370), ERK1/2 (ab17942),
RICTOR (CST 2114) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH, SC-51907). Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) was diluted
1:5000. Bound antibodies were visualized by Fusion Fx7
(Fisher Bioblock Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using
ImmobilonTM Western (Millipore Corporation, Billerica,
MA, USA), an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
kit. The resulting bands were analyzed and quantified by
ImageJ® 1.49 g software (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA). GAPDH served as a loading
control. Each membrane was reused twice after stripping
in glycine buffer (6.6 mol/L, pH 2) at 56°C for 20 min.
Each experiment was repeated at least 2 times.

Clonogenic cell survival assay
After cell trypsinization with 1 mL trypsin-EDTA
(Sigma-Aldrich Life Technologies, Saint Louis, MO,
USA) and inactivation with medium containing 10% FBS,
cells were seeded in triplicate at 150–200 cells per well
into 6-well plates. The clones were allowed to grow for
15 days in growth medium with specific drugs at 37°C in
an environment containing 5% CO2. The number of cell
colonies was counted after fixing with 70% ethanol and
staining with crystal violet. Data are represented as the
mean ± SEM percentage values.

Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)
For transfections, 1 × 105  LMS cells were seeded
in duplicate into 6-well plates and grown to 60–70%
confluency. Cells were transfected and incubated for
72 hours with 80 pmol RICTOR RNAi (AM16708261571, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using
6 μL Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) in a total volume of 300 µL growth medium
containing 10% FBS. Then, protein samples were
collected for western blotting. Each RNAi experiment was
performed at least 2 times. Negative control (AM4613,
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using an RNAi
that was not homologous to any known genes was used to
control against nonspecific effects of the oligonucleotides.

Cell apoptosis assay
STS (soft-tissue sarcoma) cells (2 × 105/well) were
seeded in 6-well plates and treated for 72 hours with
several specific drug concentrations. After treatment,
cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and labeled with annexin-V-FITC and propidium
iodide (PI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Then, cells were
analyzed with a FACS (fluorescent activating cell sorting)
Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). The percentage of cells in early apoptosis (annexinV-positive, PI-negative) and in late apoptosis or necrosis
(annexin-V- and PI-positive) was calculated using FlowJo
version 7.6.3 for Windows (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR,
USA). The percentages of overall death (sum of early and
late apoptosis) are represented as the mean ± SEM values
based on 3 independent experiments.

Drug synergy assays
LMS cells were treated with single drugs or a
combination of two drugs for 72 hours. To confirm the
synergistic effects between two drugs, a diagonal constant
ratio combination design was implemented according
to the Chou and Talalay proposition [22]. Cells were
incubated with a 2-fold serial dilution with several
concentrations above and below the IC50 values of both
drugs at a constant ratio. After the incubation period, MTT
was immediately added to the wells, and the absorbance
was monitored using the Flexstation 3 Plate reader. The
analysis of the synergy assay was conducted by the
isobologram and combination index (CI) methods derived
from the median-effect principle of Chou and Talalay. The
combination effects of the two agents can be summarized
as follows: combination index (CI) < 1 (under the curve),
CI = 1 (near the curve), and CI > 1 (above the curve)

Western blotting
Treated and control whole cells were harvested
using 60 µL radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
lysis buffer [35]. The lysate was centrifuged (13 000 rpm,
15 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was stored at –80°C until
further use. Total proteins (30 µg) were electrophoresed
on an 8, 12 or 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)

were harvested in 10% paraformaldehyde. Paraffin
sections were incubated with anti-Ki-67 (Ventana 7904286; 1:100) and anti-p-S6RPser240/244. Tissue imaging was
conducted with an Olympus CKX41 (×100) using image
capture cellSens Entry software version 1.14 for Windows
(Olympus, Rungis, France). The immunoreactivity
signal corresponding to the target expression level was
estimated by a pathologist on the basis of the percentage
of positively stained cells.

Animal studies
All animal experiments under project license
DIR1384 were performed with the approval of the
institutional animal use and care committee. LMS cells
(5 × 106 cells/100 µL) were injected subcutaneously into
the right flank of Ragγ2C–/– mice (n = 10). Only the
IB136 LMS cell line was able to grow in mice. Once
palpable, the tumor volumes were calculated using the
following formula: length × width2 / 2. After tumors
reached approximately 100 mm3 in average size, animals
were treated by oral gavage (100 µL). BEZ235 and
GSK1120212 were prepared by dissolving in 1 volume
of NMP (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) in a 100°C water
bath followed by the addition of 9 volumes of PEG300
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France). GDC0941 and everolimus were dissolved in water with
0.5% methylcellulose and 0.5% Tween 80 (SigmaAldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France). To study of the
effect of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors on LMS
tumor growth, mice were randomly assigned to receive
40 mg/kg BEZ235, 50 mg/kg GDC-0941, 5 mg/kg
everolimus or the corresponding vehicle (NMP/PEG300
or methylcellulose). To study the anti-tumor effect of
BEZ235 and GSK1120212 alone or in combination, mice
were randomly treated with vehicle, 10 mg/kg BEZ235,
0.5 mg/kg GSK1120212 or a combination of both drugs.
Drug concentrations were not the same as the previous
in vitro experiments due to the strong synergy observed
with the drug combination. Three weeks after drug
administration, mice were euthanized, and tumors were
excised. Tumor progression was analyzed with GraphPad
Prism software and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used
to compare individual tumor doubling rates. Log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) tests were used to compare Kaplan-Meier
curves with the program GraphPad Prism and p-values of
0.05 and below were considered significant.

To perform immunohistochemistry on LMS cell line
pellets, cells were grown to confluency in 6-well plates.
Then, the cells were harvested, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for
5 minutes, incubated overnight in 10% paraformaldehyde
and placed carefully into a cassette lined with biopsy
filter paper. Next, the cell pellets were embedded in
paraffin. Finally, sections of patient tumor samples and
corresponding LMS cell line pellets were incubated with
either anti-p-S6RPser240/244 (CST 5364; 1:100) or antiPTEN (CST 9559; 1:100). To confirm a negative labeling
in tissues, we used endothelial cells as a positive control.
For the in vivo study, three weeks after treatment with
drugs or vehicles, mice were euthanized, and tumors
