Abstract
Non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with activating EGFR
mutations become resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI),
often through second-site mutations in EGFR (T790M) and/or
activation of the cMet pathway. We engineered a bispeciﬁc
EGFR-cMet antibody (JNJ-61186372) with multiple mechanisms of action to inhibit primary/secondary EGFR mutations
and the cMet pathway. JNJ-61186372 blocked ligand-induced
phosphorylation of EGFR and cMet and inhibited phosphoERK and phospho-AKT more potently than the combination
of single receptor–binding antibodies. In NSCLC tumor models driven by EGFR and/or cMet, JNJ-61186372 treatment

resulted in tumor regression through inhibition of signaling/
receptor downmodulation and Fc-driven effector interactions.
Complete and durable regression of human lung xenograft
tumors was observed with the combination of JNJ-61186372
and a third-generation EGFR TKI. Interestingly, treatment
of cynomolgus monkeys with JNJ-61186372 resulted in no
major toxicities, including absence of skin rash observed
with other EGFR-directed agents. These results highlight the
differentiated potential of JNJ-61186372 to inhibit the spectrum of mutations driving EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC.

Introduction

of EGFR and facilitate the survival of cancer cells. These two
mechanisms can also occur simultaneously in EGFR TKI–resistant
NSCLC patients (3, 6, 10, 11).
Because of the signaling cross-talk between EGFR and cMet,
inhibition of both receptors in combination may limit compensatory pathway activation and improve overall efﬁcacy. A novel
bispeciﬁc antibody platform was used to produce JNJ-61186372,
an antibody that binds EGFR with one Fab arm and cMet with the
other Fab arm (12, 13). We have optimized JNJ-61186372 to
engage multiple mechanisms of action. First, we demonstrated
dual inhibition of both EGFR and cMet signaling by blocking
ligand-induced activation and by inducing receptor degradation.
In addition, high levels of EGFR and cMet on the surface of tumor
cells allow for targeting of these cells for destruction by immune
effector cells through Fc-dependent effector mechanisms, such as
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). JNJ-61186372
is produced by an engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell
line defective for protein fucosylation. The human FcgRIIIa, critical
for ADCC, binds antibodies with low-level core fucosylation more
tightly and consequently mediates more potent and effective ADCC
killing of cancer cells (14). Thus, the low-level core fucosylation in
the JNJ-61186372 molecule translates to an enhanced level of
ADCC activity compared with the same fully fucosylated molecule.
JNJ-61186372 was demonstrated to employ multiple mechanisms to inhibit tumors with primary EGFR-activating mutations,
tumors with the T790M second-site resistance mutation in EGFR,
and tumors with activation of the cMet pathway. Furthermore, the
combination of JNJ-61186372 and a third-generation EGFR TKI
(AZD9291) resulted in complete and durable regression of
tumors. Interestingly, treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with

Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently driven by
activating mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR, occurring
most commonly as in-frame deletions in exon 19 and L858R exon
21 mutations. Most patients initially respond to ﬁrst-generation
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as geﬁtinib and
erlotinib, but the clinical beneﬁts are not durable. Drug resistance
limits the response to a mean duration of <1 year (1, 2). In
addition to the T790M secondary mutation in EGFR (50% of
resistant cases; refs. 1, 3–6) that reduces potency of reversible TKIs
(7), resistant tumors may also develop activation of the cMet
pathway, through MET gene ampliﬁcation, increased cMet expression, and/or increased expression of the cMet ligand, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF; refs. 5, 6, 8, 9). Stimulation of the cMet
pathway provides an alternate mechanism to bypass the TKI block

EGFR/cMet–Bispeciﬁc Ab in EGFR TKI–Resistant Lung Tumors

JNJ-61186372 resulted in no toxicities, including absence of skin
rash observed with other EGFR-directed agents. This proﬁle of
preclinical data supports the development of JNJ-61186372 in
patients with lung cancer and other malignancies associated with
aberrant EGFR and cMet signaling.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of parental mAbs
The EGFR arm of JNJ-61186372 is derived from zalutumumab
that has a conformational epitope on EGFR domain III, which
overlaps with the EGF ligand–binding site (15) but is different
from the epitopes of cetuximab (16) and panitumumab (17). The
cMet-binding arm of JNJ-61186372 has an epitope that blocks
HGF ligand binding but is distinct from the onartuzumab epitope
(18). Parental mAbs used to generate JNJ-61186372 were prepared from CHO cell lines that generate mAbs with low levels of
core fucosylation. Antibody expression and puriﬁcation is
described in detail elsewhere (19).
Controlled Fab-arm exchange to generate bispeciﬁc Abs
Bispeciﬁc human IgG1 Abs were produced from the two puriﬁed
bivalent parental antibodies, each with the respective single complementary mutation: K409R or F405L (12). Controlled Fab-arm
exchange (cFAE) was performed as described previously (12), with
a 5% excess of anti-EGFR-F405L. Similar conditions for preparation and characterizations were used to generate the normal fucose
(EGFR-cMet) and JNJ-61186372-IgG2s Abs, and monovalent
EGFR and cMet Abs. All bispeciﬁc antibodies were puriﬁed using
hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The EGFR monovalent
antibody consists of an EGFR-binding arm and a nonbinding arm
(either anti-HIV-gp120 or anti-RSV-F, which did not bind the cell
lines used); the cMet monovalent antibody consists of a cMetbinding arm and similar aforementioned nonbinding arm.
Competitive ligand binding
EGFR-ECD-Fc (R&D Systems; 200 ng/well) was coated on High
Bind Plate [Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)] for 2 hours (all steps
performed at room temperature). MSD Blocker A buffer (5%, 150
mL/well) was added and incubated for 2 hours. Plates were washed
3 times with 0.1 mol/L HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, then the mixture of
the MSD ﬂuorescence dye–labeled Hu-EGF with different competitors was added. Labeled EGF (50 nmol/L) was incubated with
antibodies (1 nmol/L–4 mmol/L), then added to wells (25 mL
mixture). After 2 hours, plates were washed as above. MSD Read
Buffer T was diluted with distilled water (4-fold), dispensed
(150 mL/well), and analyzed with a SECTOR Imager 6000.
PolyHistidine mAb050 (R&D Systems; 50 ng/well) was coated
on MSD High Bind Plate for 2 hours. Blocking and washing steps
were as above, followed by capturing 30 mL (10 mg/mL) of cMetECD-Fc (R&D Systems). After 1 hour, plates were washed as
above. After the mixture of biotinylated HGF with different
antibodies was added to plates, labeled HGF (10 nmol/L) was
incubated with antibodies (0.001–2 mmol/L), then added to wells
(25 mL mixture). After 1-hour incubation, plates were washed
and then MSD ﬂuorescence dye–labeled streptavidin, 25 mL
(10 nmol/L), was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour.
Plates were washed, read, and analyzed as above.
Cell culture and HGF-engineered cell line
For these studies, 7 NSCLC tumor cell lines (NCI-H292,
HCC827, NCI-H1975, NCI-H3255, HCC4006, NCI-H820, and

www.aacrjournals.org

NCI-H1993) were selected to reﬂect patient diversity in the
mutational status of EGFR and gene copy number of MET. The
tumor cell lines were obtained (2011–2013) from the NCI
(Bethesda, MD; H3255) or ATCC (all others). Cell lines were
authenticated using short tandem repeat assay and either used
immediately or banked, with all experiments occurring within 2
months of resuscitation. The mutations in each cell line were
conﬁrmed using a custom somatic mutation array (SABiosciences). Cells were cultured in 150-cm2 tissue culture ﬂasks under
standard culture conditions (37 C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) and
grown in RPMI1640 medium þ GlutaMAX þ 25 mmol/L HEPES
(Life Technologies), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Life Technologies), 0.1 mmol/L Non-Essential Amino Acids (Life Technologies), and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies). Subconﬂuent cell monolayers were passaged after treatment with
0.25%-w/v trypsin (Life Technologies).
The H1975-HGF cell line was created by transducing H1975
cells with HGF lentivirus (generated using Human HGF Plasmid
and Packaging Kit; GeneCopoeia) to express the human HGF
gene. H1975 cells were plated at one million cells in a 100 mm
dish in RPMI media. After infection, cells were selected using
2 mg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen); 20 pg/mL HGF (MSD assay)
was secreted (5,000 cells/well) over 72-hour incubation.
Receptor phosphorylation assays
Receptor phosphorylation assays were performed as described,
with cells plated at 6500 to 10,000 cells per well (19). The signals
were not corrected for total levels of receptor. Data were plotted as
relative enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; RCL) signal versus
the logarithm of antibody concentration. IC50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) using a fourparameter logistic (4PL) model.
ERK and AKT phosphorylation assays
Cells were grown in RPMI growth medium supplemented with
7.5 ng/mL HGF, then lysed after 30-minute (pERK assay) or 1hour (pAkt assay) treatment with the antibodies. Phospho-ERK
(Thr202/Tyr204; Thr185/Tyr187) levels and phospho-AKT
(S473) levels were measured using MSD assays. The signals were
not corrected for total levels of ERK or Akt. RCL signal was
recorded and data plotted as with receptor phosphorylation
assays, with statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism 6. Extra
sum-of-squares F test was used to compare treatments.
Preparation/analysis of tumor lysates
Mice bearing established H1975-HGF tumors were treated with
a single dose of JNJ-61186372 (1, 5, or 20 mg/kg) or vehicle
control (PBS). 72 hours postdose, tumors were harvested, ﬂash
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) containing 2 HALT/EDTA protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 50
mmol/L NaF, 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate (activated), and
1 mmol/L PMSF using a FastPrep-24 homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce).
Protein samples (50 mg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in
Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) for 1 hour at room temperature
and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight
at 4 C: anti-EGFR (EGF-R2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Met

Bands were detected with anti-mouse IRDye680 (LI-COR) or
anti-rabbit IRDye800 (LI-COR) and imaged using an Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Average total protein quantitated from Western blots, relative to loading control (GAPDH or
actin), was graphed and statistical analysis performed using
GraphPad Prism 6. Total cMet data were analyzed using a twosided, unpaired, equal variance t test, and total EGFR data were
analyzed using a two-sided, unpaired t test with Welch Correction
for unequal variance. Tumor lysates were examined using MSD
assays for phospho-proteins (p-EGFR, p-cMet, p-ERK, or p-AKT),
as described above. Ordinary one-way ANOVA and two-sided,
unpaired Dunnett multiple comparisons tests on log-transformed
MSD signal values were used to compare treatment groups using
GraphPad Prism 6. Multiplicity-adjusted P values were reported.

with HCC827 and HCC827-ER1 were performed at Precos.
Nude mice (MF1 NU/NU, 5–8 weeks old; Harlan, Teklad) were
injected subcutaneously with 1  107 cells (0.2 mL/mouse). The
LU1235 and LU1868 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were
performed by Crown Biosciences. PDX tumor fragments, harvested
from donor mice, were inoculated into female nude mice (BALB/c,
8–10 weeks old; Beijing HFK Bio-Technology Co). Animals were
treated with compounds when tumors reached a mean tumor size
of 120 to 170 mm3. Percentage tumor growth inhibition (%TGI)
was deﬁned as the difference between the control-treated group
mean tumor volume (MTV) and the test compound–treated group
MTV, expressed as a percentage of the MTV of the control-treated
group. The statistical analysis of one H1975-HGF study (Fig. 4) was
performed comparing treatment groups with control by two-way
ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparisons tests (GraphPad
Prism). The statistical analysis of HCC827, HCC827-ER1, LU1235,
LU1868, H1975, and H1975-HGF (Fig. 7) studies was performed
on the log-transformed tumor volume data and a Tukey–Kramer P
value adjustment for multiplicity (SAS).

ADCC assays
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
isolated from normal donor leukopaks (Biological Specialty
Corporation) for use as effector cells and were cryopreserved. The
PBMCs from donors with FcgRIIIa 158V/F (20) were used in
ADCC assays (21, 22).

Results
Bispeciﬁc antibody binding to EGFR and cMet prevents ligand
binding
Parental monospeciﬁc bivalent antibodies (F405L for antiEGFR; K409R for anti-cMet) were expressed separately in cell
lines incorporating low levels (<9%) of fucose to enhance ADCC.
The bispeciﬁc EGFR-cMet Ab, prepared using cFAE with >95%
yield (Fig. 1A; refs. 12, 13), was designated JNJ-61186372.

EGFR/cMet–Bispeciﬁc Ab in EGFR TKI–Resistant Lung Tumors

JNJ-61186372 was conﬁrmed to be >99% bispeciﬁc Ab with
<0.2% parental mAbs.
JNJ-61186372 binding to the extracellular domains (ECD) of
EGFR and cMet was conﬁrmed using surface plasmon resonance
methods (19). JNJ-61186372 has an afﬁnity (KD) of 1.4 nmol/L
for EGFR-ECD and a KD ¼ 40 pmol/L for cMet-ECD. Using similar
methods, JNJ-61186372 was shown to bind both EGFR-ECD and
cMet-ECD simultaneously (19).
JNJ-61186372 blocked the ligand binding of each receptor in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). JNJ-61186372 inhibited
ruthenium-labeled EGF binding to EGFR-ECD with an IC50 ¼
10 nmol/L and inhibited biotinylated-labeled HGF binding to
cMet-ECD with an IC50 ¼ 30 nmol/L. These results demonstrated
that JNJ-61186372 bound to both EGFR and cMet with high
afﬁnity and furthermore inhibited ligand binding to each receptor
with similar potency compared with the parental monospeciﬁc
bivalent antibodies.

JNJ-61186372 inhibits receptor phosphorylation of EGFR and
cMet
Human lung cancer cell lines, representing different EGFR and
cMet genotypes that often occur in NSCLC patients, were selected
to evaluate the cellular activity of JNJ-61186372 (Supplementary
Table S1). These included cell lines with EGFR primary activating
mutations, EGFR T790M mutation (confers resistance to EGFR
TKIs), either alone or with MET gene ampliﬁcation, and cell lines
with wild-type (WT) EGFR and WT levels of cMet. In these cell
lines, JNJ-61186372 inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of
EGFR and HGF-induced phosphorylation of cMet in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2A), with activities (IC50) below 100
nmol/L (Fig. 2B). The level of phosphorylated EGFR in the
untreated H1975 cells (EGFR mutations L858R; T790M) was
higher than that of H292 cells (EGFR WT) due to the activating
mutation in EGFR. Addition of EGF to H1975 cells resulted in a
smaller induction of phosphorylated EGFR compared with the

JNJ-61186372 inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR in the EGFstimulated H1975 cells, reducing the phosphorylation of EGFR to
levels below the unstimulated condition.
Enhanced inhibition of downstream signaling with JNJ-61186372
To determine whether dual inhibition of receptor phosphorylation had downstream signaling consequences, the inhibition
of phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT by JNJ-61186372 was
assessed in the same panel of cell lines (Fig. 3A). JNJ61186372 demonstrated potent inhibition of both phospho-ERK
and phospho-AKT, with IC50 values in the low or subnanomolar
range for most cell lines tested. However, in cell lines with MET
gene ampliﬁcation (H820 and H1993), JNJ-61186372 demonstrated either weak or no inhibition of phospho-ERK or phosphoAKT.

antibodies was also assessed and compared with that of JNJ61186372 (Fig. 3B–E). In H292 cells, neither treatment with the
monovalent EGFR or monovalent cMet antibody caused complete inhibition of pERK, whereas the combination of the two

3946 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

monovalent antibodies caused complete inhibition of pERK with
an IC50 ¼ 35 nmol/L (Fig. 3B). This result demonstrated that
inhibition of both EGFR and cMet was necessary for full inhibition of pERK in this cell line. Interestingly in H292 cells, treatment
with JNJ-61186372 resulted in complete inhibition of pERK, but
with a lower IC50 ¼ 0.64 nmol/L, a 55-fold increase in potency (P
< 0.0001) for JNJ-61186372 compared with that of the combination of monovalent antibodies. Also in H292 cells, the monovalent cMet antibody was as effective as the combination of
monovalent antibodies at inhibiting pAKT, suggesting that pAKT
was more dependent on cMet signaling compared with EGFR
signaling in this cell line (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, JNJ-61186372
was 179-fold more potent for inhibition of pAKT (P < 0.0001)
compared with the combination of monovalent antibodies, suggesting that the bispeciﬁc molecule had additional biologic effects
not present in the combination of monovalent antibodies. Similarly, there was more potent inhibition of pERK and pAKT in
H1975 cells using JNJ-61186372 [(65-fold greater inhibition of
pERK (P < 0.0001); 75-fold greater inhibition of pAKT (P <
0.0001)] than the combination of monovalent antibodies (Fig.
3D and E).

Figure 4.
Fc effector function of JNJ-61186372 was enhanced in vitro and was important for efﬁcacy in vivo. A, ADCC assays were performed using H292 (top) and H1975
(bottom) cells. Low fucose JNJ-61186372 was compared with normal fucose EGFR-cMet antibody, cetuximab, and IgG1 control antibody. B, H1975-HGF model was
used to compare JNJ-61186372 with JNJ-61186372-IgG2s for efﬁcacy. Antibodies were dosed at 10 mg/kg two times per week i.p. (10 animals/group).

JNJ-61186372 caused tumor cell lysis through enhanced
effector function
We hypothesized that high levels of EGFR and cMet on the
surface of tumor cells may allow for selective immune effector cell
targeting through ADCC. JNJ-61186372 was engineered to have
low levels of core fucose, which allows for tighter binding to
human FcgRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells, thus resulting in a
more potent and effective ADCC killing of target cells (14).
The ADCC in vitro activity of JNJ-61186372 was tested using
H292 and H1975 cells with human PBMCs as the source of NK
cells (Fig. 4A). For comparison, an analogue of JNJ-61186372, but
produced with normal fucose levels, and cetuximab (anti-EGFR
mAb) were assessed in the same assay. The low fucose JNJ61186372 was more potent and demonstrated increased levels
of tumor cell lysis compared with the EGFR-cMet bispeciﬁc
antibody with normal fucose levels. Similar results were observed
using additional lung cancer cell lines, including those with either
WT or mutant EGFR and WT or ampliﬁed MET (Supplementary
Table S2). The ADCC capacity of the low fucose JNJ-61186372
was similar to the ADCC capacity of cetuximab. However, there
were some cases where JNJ-61186372 demonstrated slightly
improved ADCC activity in potency (EC50) and/or efﬁcacy (%
maximal lysis).
JNJ-61186372 inhibited tumor growth in the H1975-HGF
xenograft model
The H1975 cell line carries both an activating mutation
(L858R) and a second-site mutation in EGFR (T790M) that
confers resistance to small-molecule EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib.

www.aacrjournals.org

In addition, this line was engineered to express human HGF
(H1975-HGF) so the human cMet on the tumor cells would be
activated in the mouse host (mouse HGF does not effectively
activate human cMet, ref. 23). H1975-HGF cells were implanted
into immune-compromised mice to assess in vivo efﬁcacy of JNJ61186372 on xenograft tumors. In addition, the contribution of
effector function to efﬁcacy in vivo was evaluated.
After subcutaneous tumors were established, the mice were
treated with vehicle control (PBS), JNJ-61186372, or an antibody with the same EGFR and cMet-binding arms but with an
IgG2s framework (JNJ-61186372-IgG2s). Antibodies with an
IgG2s framework have less binding to Fc receptors of effector
cells (such as NK cells and macrophages), but maintain similar
pharmacokinetics to IgG1 antibodies, so any loss of activity
observed with JNJ-61186372-IgG2s antibody should represent
the contribution of the effector-mediated function of JNJ61186372 (24).
As shown in Fig. 4B, JNJ-61186372 inhibited tumor growth by
80% compared with vehicle-treated animals at day 32 (P <
0.0001). Interestingly, JNJ-61186372-IgG2s antibody (Fc silent
version) inhibited tumor growth by 47% (P ¼ 0.0232) but was
not as effective as JNJ-61186372 with the FcR-binding framework.
These results demonstrate efﬁcacy of JNJ-61186372 in the H1975HGF model, with EGFR mutations (L858R; T790M) and cMet
activation through autocrine expression of HGF. In addition,
without effector function, the inhibition of EGFR and cMet alone
reduced tumor growth relative to the vehicle control, but the
addition of the effector function (IgG1 framework) is necessary
for complete JNJ-61186372 in vivo activity.

Decreased EGFR and cMet protein, phospho-EGFR, phospho-cMet, and phospho-AKT levels in H1975-HGF tumors from mice treated with JNJ-61186372. A, mice with
H1975-HGF tumors were treated with a single dose of JNJ-61186372 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle control (PBS). Tumor lysates were examined by Western blot
analysis for total levels of EGFR, cMet, or actin/GAPDH (loading controls). B, average total protein quantitated from Western blots, relative to loading controls.
C, mice with H1975-HGF tumors were treated with a single dose of JNJ-61186372 (1, 5, or 20 mg/kg) or vehicle control (PBS). Tumor lysates examined using
MSD assays for phospho-EGFR, phospho-cMet, phospho-ERK, or phospho-AKT.

JNJ-61186372 induced receptor downmodulation in vivo
To further understand the function of JNJ-61186372 in vivo,
mice bearing H1975-HGF tumors were treated with either PBS
vehicle control or JNJ-61186372 at 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg. Tumor
lysates from mice treated with 20 mg/kg JNJ-61186372 and those
treated with vehicle were analyzed for total EGFR and cMet levels
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). The average total protein levels
of both EGFR and cMet were signiﬁcantly decreased following
antibody treatment compared with those of vehicle-treated
tumors by 76% (P < 0.0001) and 61% (P ¼ 0.0007), respectively.
Not surprisingly, because levels of total receptor were signiﬁcantly
reduced (Fig. 5A and B), phospho-EGFR and phospho-Met levels
were also signiﬁcantly reduced at all doses tested compared with
those of vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5C). Phospho-AKT was
signiﬁcantly reduced at 5 and 20 mg/kg antibody treatment, but
levels of phospho-ERK were not signiﬁcantly decreased in this
experiment. These results demonstrated downmodulation of
both receptor targets and downstream signaling in the tumor by

JNJ-61186372 is effective in EGFR-mutant xenograft models,
with or without cMet activation
JNJ-61186372 was evaluated in a pair of human lung adenocarcinoma HCC827 xenograft models, both with a primary EGFR
mutation (exon 19 deletion), but one with MET ampliﬁcation
(clone of parental HCC827; originally selected to have resistance
to erlotinib; HCC827-ER1). In mice with HCC827 tumors, treatment with either erlotinib or JNJ-61186372 fully suppressed
tumor growth during the treatment period (28 days) and to
approximately 50 days posttreatment initiation (Fig. 6A). Both
JNJ-61186372 and erlotinib inhibited tumor growth by 89%
compared with vehicle-treated animals at day 45 (both P <
0.05). In mice with HCC827-ER1 tumors, JNJ-61186372 fully
suppressed tumor growth, whereas erlotinib was only partially
effective during treatment (days 7–31), and mean tumor volume

Figure 6.
JNJ-61186372 was efﬁcacious in EGFR-mutant models, with or without cMet activation. JNJ-61186372 (10 mg/kg two times/week i.p.) was tested for efﬁcacy in
HCC827 model (A) and HCC827-ER1 model (B; 9 animals/group). JNJ-61186372 was efﬁcacious in PDX models with EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletion (C) and L858R,
T790M (D). The JNJ-61186372 used in C and D was an earlier preparation with normal fucose levels and residual parental bivalent EGFR antibody remaining (12%).
Erlotinib was dosed at 25 or 50 mg/kg daily orally; 9 or 10 animals per group.

increased at a similar rate as vehicle-treated tumors following
cessation of treatment (Fig. 6B). However, in animals treated with
JNJ-61186372, mean tumor volume slightly increased in 5 weeks
following cessation of treatment. At day 37, erlotinib inhibited
tumor growth by 63% (P < 0.05), while JNJ-61186372 inhibited
tumor growth by 92% (P < 0.05), compared with vehicle-treated
animals. These results suggested that in tumors with both EGFR
mutations and MET ampliﬁcation, dual inhibition of both EGFR
and cMet was necessary for complete inhibition of tumor growth.

LU1868 PDX model contains both a primary activating mutation
in EGFR (L858R) and the second-site mutation in EGFR (T790M,
known to cause resistance to erlotinib treatment). As expected in
this model, erlotinib was not effective (Fig. 6D). However, JNJ61186372 treatment caused regression of the LU1868 tumors in a
durable manner for up to 2 months following cessation of
treatment. JNJ-61186372 was effective in PDX models with either
primary activating mutations in EGFR alone, and with the addition of T790M EGFR TKI resistance mutation.

JNJ-61186372 is effective in PDX models with EGFR mutations
We tested the bispeciﬁc EGFR-cMet antibody efﬁcacy in PDX
models with EGFR mutations. For these studies, we used a version
of JNJ-61186372 prepared with normal fucose levels. LU1235
PDX model is derived from a human lung primary adenocarcinoma tumor with a primary activating EGFR mutation (exon 19
deletion). In these tumors, treatments with erlotinib and JNJ61186372 were both effective at regressing tumor volumes, but
JNJ-61186372 continued to suppress tumor growth following
cessation of treatment (Fig. 6C). These results demonstrated that
in tumors with a primary activating mutation in EGFR, the
bispeciﬁc EGFR-cMet antibody led to a more durable response
than erlotinib treatment. The human lung adenocarcinoma

Combination of JNJ-61186372 and third-generation EGFR TKI
resulted in durable tumor regression
Third-generation EGFR TKIs, such as AZD9291 and CO-1686,
preferentially inhibit mutant-activated EGFR compared with WT
EGFR. To assess whether the combination of a third-generation
EGFR TKI and JNJ-61186372 would have beneﬁt, we tested
AZD9291 and JNJ-61186372 as single agents and in combination
in the parental H1975 model (Fig. 7A) and the engineered
H1975-HGF model (Fig. 7B). During the treatment period,
AZD9291 inhibited tumor growth in both parental H1975 (TGI
¼ 100%) and H1975-HGF (TGI ¼ 94%) models, P < 0.05 for
both. However, AZD9291-treated tumors increased in volume
after treatment cessation in the H1975-HGF model. During the

showed no efﬁcacy in either model (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Altogether, these results demonstrated that combination of a
third-generation EGFR TKI and JNJ-61186372 caused regression
of tumors in a sustained and durable manner.
Absence of EGFR-mediated skin rash after repeat
administration of JNJ-61186372
Both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP safety
studies were performed in cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were
given JNJ-61186372 intravenously at doses up to 120 mg/kg once
per week for up to 5 weeks. No toxicities were observed in either
study, including none of the skin or gut adverse events that are
commonly observed with other anti-EGFR agents (25). Notably,
JNJ-61186372 recovered in serum from cynomolgus monkeys
treated with JNJ-61186372 was fully functional in inhibition of
phospho-EGFR and phospho-Met in vitro using H292 human
cancer cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4). Our preliminary data
suggested that this lack of skin toxicity may be attributable to a
lower single-arm binding afﬁnity for puriﬁed EGFR protein compared with cetuximab [JNJ-61186372 KD ¼ 1.4 nmol/L (19);
cetuximab KD ¼ 0.4 nmol/L in same assay format]. This lower
afﬁnity then translates into less potent binding to cells expressing
low levels of EGFR and cMet, such as primary human dermal
ﬁbroblasts. We found that JNJ-61186372 bound to primary
human dermal ﬁbroblasts with an EC50 ¼ 2.0 nmol/L, whereas
cetuximab bound 20-fold tighter, with an EC50 ¼ 0.1 nmol/L.
Binding to normal tissues is also likely enhanced by the bivalent
nature of cetuximab, compared with the monovalent EGFR binding of JNJ-61186372.

Discussion
Extensive evidence has demonstrated that the EGFR and cMet
signaling pathways are partially compensatory and mediate cross
resistance to inhibitors of either pathway (4, 8, 9). Standard-ofcare treatment for lung cancer patients with activating mutations
in EGFR involves small-molecule EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib or
geﬁtinib. These therapies, although often initially very effective,
ultimately fail due to resistance mediated by second-site EGFR
mutations, such as T790M, or activation of bypass pathways, such
as the cMet pathway (4, 9, 10, 26). Second- and third-generation
EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib, AZD9291, and CO-1686, have
produced exciting clinical results, but resistance to therapy
remains a prominent challenge. Resistance mechanisms to
third-generation EGFR TKIs are still being deﬁned in patient
samples, but an emerging frequent mechanism is mutation of
EGFR (C797S; ref. 27). Evidence of MET ampliﬁcation in lung
tumor cells from a patient treated with AZD9291 has also been
reported, suggesting that activation of the cMet pathway is clinically relevant for the third-generation EGFR TKIs (28).
To address these resistance issues, we have created a bispeciﬁc
antibody, JNJ-61186372, that recognizes both EGFR and cMet.
We have demonstrated that JNJ-61186372 inhibits tumor growth
and progression by three distinct mechanisms. Two of these
mechanisms involve inhibition of EGFR and cMet signaling, ﬁrst
by inhibition of ligand-induced activation via blocking ligand
binding to each receptor and second by receptor inactivation via
degradation. The third mechanism utilizes Fc effector-mediated
killing of EGFR- and cMet-expressing tumor cells by ADCC.
Through these mechanisms of action, JNJ-61186372 showed
activity in multiple xenograft models containing diverse EGFR

www.aacrjournals.org

mutations (exon 19 deletion, L858R, T790M). Given that JNJ61186372 recognizes the extracellular region of EGFR, this bispeciﬁc antibody has the potential to be active in tumors with
C797S mutation (located intracellularly) as well. In addition, JNJ61186372 was active in models with cMet pathway activation,
either by autocrine ligand production or through MET gene
ampliﬁcation. JNJ-61186372 was also active in a model with WT
EGFR and autocrine HGF production (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Collectively, the unique mechanisms of action of JNJ-61186372
cover the spectrum of EGFR mutations and also inhibit the key
pathways driving EGFR TKI–acquired resistances.
Combination therapies may be necessary to fully suppress the
EGFR pathway and prevent resistance from occurring through
multiple mechanisms. The combination of afatinib and cetuximab was shown to cause near complete tumor regression in mice
with L858R/T790M erlotinib-resistant tumors (29) by depleting
phosphorylated and total EGFR more completely than either
single agent alone. Combining JNJ-61186372 with third-generation EGFR TKIs might have the advantage, in addition to simultaneous inhibition of the cMet pathway, of more complete
inhibition of the EGFR pathway through the ligand inhibition
and receptor degradation mechanisms. Addition of the immune
effector–based mechanisms of JNJ-61186372 may also attack
tumor cells resistant due to EGFR- and cMet-independent
mechanisms. We have shown here that the combination of
JNJ-61186372 and AZD9291 was very effective at inhibiting
tumor growth in xenograft models with EGFR mutations and
cMet activation. Furthermore, in contrast to monotherapy, treatment with the combination prevented tumor regrowth in all
animals tested. In patients, tumor heterogeneity likely contributes
to resistance; recent observations suggest that T790M-positive and
T790M-WT coexist in some lung cancers with acquired resistance
to initial EGFR TKI treatment (28, 30). Combination therapy with
JNJ-61186372 may delay or prevent the emergence of resistance,
with activity on clonal populations with varying EGFR mutations
within the same tumor, more complete suppression of the EGFR
pathway, and inhibition of cMet, a key bypass pathway.
Recently, advances in protein engineering have made the production of intact bispeciﬁc human antibodies, such as JNJ61186372, more practical. One potential advantage of the bispeciﬁc conﬁguration is the signiﬁcantly improved inhibition of
downstream signaling when both targets are present on the same
tumor cell. This property may be explained by an avidity effect, in
which cells expressing both targets engage both arms of the
bispeciﬁc (cross-arm binding) with increased apparent afﬁnity
as compared with those expressing only one target or otherwise
engaging a single Fab arm. We have described correlations
between binding afﬁnity, receptor density, and receptor phosphorylation with JNJ-61186372 (19). Furthermore, we have
shown that JNJ-61186372 was more effective than the combination therapy of anti-EGFR and anti-cMet monovalent antibodies
in decreasing tumor growth in the H1975-HGF model (31).
This bispeciﬁc structure may also confer unexpected properties
on JNJ-61186372. In contrast with other EGFR-targeted agents
(25), we did not observe EGFR-mediated skin toxicity with JNJ61186372 in cynomolgus monkeys, typically a critical limitation
of this class of agents, even at doses up to 120 mg/kg. We
hypothesize that the lack of skin rash in cynomolgus monkeys
treated with JNJ-61186372 is linked to weaker, monovalent
binding of JNJ-61186372 to EGFR compared with stronger
binding of antibodies interacting bivalently with EGFR

(e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab) to normal skin and gut cells.
Indeed, we found a 20-fold difference in afﬁnity between JNJ61186372 and cetuximab in binding to normal human dermal
ﬁbroblasts. Because normal tissues express low levels of cMet, the
cMet-binding arm of JNJ-61186372 is not engaged, thus resulting
in overall weaker binding to skin and gut cells, along with lower
inhibition of EGFR in these normal tissues. In contrast in tumor
cells, where high levels of EGFR and cMet are coexpressed, both
arms of JNJ-61186372 are engaged, and stronger binding and
functional inhibition is achieved. Alternatively, species differences in binding and activity could contribute to the observed
lack of skin toxicity. The potential lower toxicity proﬁle of JNJ61186372 may also be an advantage in combination therapies,
where efﬁcacy may be limited by toxicity issues, such as with the
combination of afatinib and cetuximab (32).
We have demonstrated three distinct mechanisms of action for
JNJ-61186372 that modulate both EGFR and cMet signaling axes.
The unique structure of JNJ-61186372 enables attack of tumor
cells with multiple mechanisms in a single agent, resulting in
durable antitumor effects in preclinical models resistant to other
therapeutic approaches. These results support testing in human
clinical trials, as monotherapy in selected patients and in combination with other agents addressing the same pathways, in lung
cancer and other malignancies.
