ABSTRACT:
PARP inhibitors hold promise as a novel class of targeted anticancer drugs.
However, their true mechanism of action is still not well understood following recent
reports that show marked differences in cellular effects. Here, we demonstrate
that three PARP drug candidates, namely, rucaparib, veliparib, and olaparib, have
a clearly different in vitro affinity profile across a panel of diverse kinases selected
using a computational approach that relates proteins by ligand similarity. In this
respect, rucaparib inhibits nine kinases with micromolar affinity, including PIM1,
PIM2, PRKD2, DYRK1A, CDK1, CDK9, HIPK2, CK2, and ALK. In contrast, olaparib does
not inhibit any of the sixteen kinases tested. In between, veliparib inhibits only two,
namely, PIM1 and CDK9. The differential kinase pharmacology observed among PARP
inhibitors provides a plausible explanation to their different cellular effects and offers
unexplored opportunities for this drug class, but alerts also on the risk associated
to transferring directly both preclinical and clinical outcomes from one PARP drug
candidate to another.

INTRODUCTION

a recent analysis of the genomic biomarkers of drug
sensitivity in cancer cell lines [8]. As an example, EWSFLI1 was found to be a sensitivity biomarker of rucaparib
and olaparib but surprisingly not of veliparib [8]. All
these differences cannot be explained on the basis of the
relatively similar affinity profiles of PARP drug candidates
across 13 members of the PARP family [9] and they are
thus indicative of the potential involvement of off-target
affinities for proteins beyond PARPs. Accordingly, gaining
a deeper understanding on the pharmacology of PARP
inhibitors beyond the PARP protein family is essential
to understand the differences observed at the clinical,
cellular, and biomarker levels.
We previously reported that PJ34, an early chemical
tool widely used to probe the biological function of PARP1, is a micromolar inhibitor of PIM1 kinase (IC50 = 3.7
µM) [10]. The significance of this result lies in the fact
that PIM1 is a confounding off-target in PARP biology,
known to be involved in many processes relevant to cancer
and thus likely to have synergistic effects with PARPs.
Since the structure of PJ34, and of many of the PARP
inhibitors currently in clinical trials, evolved from the
most simple structure of 3-AB (Figure 1) [11], one may

The evidence that a Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase
(PARP) inhibitor provided clinical benefit to patients
carrying breast-cancer-associated BRCA1 or BRCA2
gene mutations was a breakthrough in cancer therapy
[1] and boosted the initiation of clinical trials involving
several other PARP inhibitors. However, despite the early
enthusiasm, progress of PARP drug candidates to the clinic
has been slower than expected [2]. After several setbacks,
PARP inhibitors finally have advanced to Phase III clinical
trials [3] in spite of the fact that their mechanism of action
is still not fully understood [4]. In this respect, there is a
growing body of evidence to suggest that PARP inhibitors
may exert their therapeutic effect through slightly
different mechanisms of action, which could explain why
some patients without BRCA mutations respond also to
treatment with some PARP inhibitors [3,4]. Several studies
have shown recently that different PARP inhibitors, once
perceived as equivalent within the same drug class,
have significantly different cellular effects when used at
micromolar concentrations [5–7]. In addition, unexpected
differences between PARP inhibitors also emerge from

be tempted to speculate that PARP drug candidates may
have also affinity for PIM1. Indeed, a close inspection to
ChEMBL [12] revealed that PIM1 inhibition by rucaparib
(CHEMBL1173055) had already been deposited in the
database (Ki = 1.3 µM) from a large kinase profiling
campaign [13]. However, this result has largely passed
unnoticed [3], emphasizing the fact that depositing data in
publicly available resources does not guarantee common
awareness. Accordingly, we decided to investigate whether
other PARP drug candidates have also in vitro affinity for
PIM1 and explore further their potential off-target kinase
pharmacology as a means to better understand their
mechanism of action.

The results of the in vitro kinase profiling clearly
demonstrate that PARP drug candidates have different
affinity for PIM1 and related kinases, as summarized in
Figure 2 (dose-response curves available as supplementary
data). For the sake of completeness, a recently published
comprehensive comparison of the affinities of these drugs
on 13 PARP family members is also included [9]. It is
worth noting that both assays are not directly comparable
in terms of affinity as the PARP profiling was done using
differential scanning fluorimetry instead of inhibition.
However, they enable us to comprehensively compare

how these PARP drug candidates interact with kinases
and PARPs. Above all, it is interesting to stress that while
olaparib and rucaparib have a relatively similar affinity
profile among the members of the PARP family, they
differ significantly in their respective kinase profiles. As
can be observed, while olaparib has no relevant affinities
for any of the 16 protein kinases tested, rucaparib presents
micromolar affinities (IC50 values) for 9 of them, namely,
PIM1 (1.2 µM), PIM2 (7.7 µM), PRKD2 (9.7 µM),
DYRK1A (1.4 µM), CDK1 (1.4 µM), CDK9 (2.7 µM),
HIPK2 (4.4 µM), CK2 (7.8 µM), and ALK (18 µM).
In this respect, olaparib appears to be a markedly more
selective PARP inhibitor than rucaparib. In between,
veliparib shows low micromolar affinities for PIM1
(17 µM) and CDK9 (8.2 µM). Dose-response curves of
the in vitro binding affinity of rucaparib and veliparib
for PIM1 kinase are shown in Figure 3. Remarkably, in
line with the selection of 11 of those kinases by ligand
similarity to PIM1, it is observed that the higher the
affinity of the PARP inhibitor for PIM1, the higher the
number of additional kinases to which the compound has
affinity. Overall, the results presented here provide clear
evidence that, at micromolar concentrations, confounding/
synergistic effects from affinities of PARP inhibitors to
various kinases deserve serious consideration.
Having confirmed that different PARP drug
candidates are linked to essentially different kinase
profiles, we wondered whether that could just be the tip
of the iceberg. A recent HTS screening against S6K1
kinase surprisingly unraveled that a PARP inhibitor
(Nu1085) (Figure 1) was also inhibiting S6K1 kinase with
high affinity (IC50 = 0.56 µM) [14]. The crystallization
of Nu1085 bound to S6K1 kinase [14] enabled us to
compare how the benzamide common to all structures
of PARP inhibitors (Figure 1) interacts with both kinases
and PARPs, offering an explanation at a molecular level

for the observed off-target kinase pharmacology of PARP
inhibitors. As schematically illustrated in Figure 1, the
benzamide group binds to the kinase hinge region, a
highly conserved region among kinases located at the
ATP binding site [14]. Moreover, the interactions of the
benzamide are very similar in both PARP-1 and S6K1
hinge region (Figure 1). Therefore, PARP inhibitors
might have a natural tendency to inhibit kinases due to
the presence of this benzamide moiety in their structures.
As the chemical structures grow from the hinge region to
the gatekeeper residue (as is the case of olaparib), PARP
inhibitors are likely to clash/interact with pockets on
the back cleft of kinases and gain selectivity for PARPs
over kinases [14]. This way, different PARP inhibitors
will interact differently with kinases depending on their
size and decoration, in line with the results reported here
(Figure 2).
To strengthen this hypothesis, we searched ChEMBL
[12] for dual PARP-kinase inhibitors and we found that
4 other PARP inhibitors are already reported to interact
differently with many kinases [12,13]. One of these
compounds, CHEMBL539474, inhibits both PARP-1 (Ki
= 0.698 µM) and kinases known to synergize with PARP1 with high affinity [15], namely, PLK1 (Ki = 0.079 µM)
or GSK3A (Ki = 0.2 µM). We also used the webserver
MANTRA to investigate the gene expression profile of the
only PARP inhibitor present in the MANTRA database,
1,5-isoquinolinediol [16]. When the gene expression
profile of 1,5-isoquinolinediol across 4 breast cancer cell
lines is compared to the other 1300 drugs available in
MANTRA, the most similar gene expression signature is
the one corresponding to the EGFR tyrosine kinase drug
gefitinib. This result highlights also that PARP and kinase
inhibitors regulate genes in a similar way, suggesting
that they may share mechanism-of-action targets. In light
of all these findings, the kinase pharmacology of PARP

inhibitors reported here is likely to expand as more PARP
inhibitors are screened against larger panels of kinases.

in the combination of PARP and kinase inhibitors [24].
An example of this situation is the current clinical
investigation of the potential synergistic anticancer effects
between PARP-1 and CDK1 using veliparib and dinaciclib
(clinical trial NCT01434316), whereas synergism between
those two targets was validated in cellular studies using
rucaparib and RO-3306 [25]. The fact that veliparib and
rucaparib have a markedly different kinase profile (Figure
2), with only rucaparib directly inhibiting CDK1, warns
on the extrapolation of the results from this clinical trial
to PARP inhibitors other than veliparib itself. Beyond the
combination with kinase inhibitors, PARP inhibitors have
been combined with other drugs, chemotherapeutic agents,
and radiation in a number of pre-clinical and clinical
studies [26-28] . It is well known that the inhibition of
different kinases, including PIM1 and CDKs, can induce
sensitivity [29,30] or resistance [31] to some of those
chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, the off-target kinase
pharmacology of PARP inhibitors could have also an
effect on the sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents used in combination. This possibility should now
be taken seriously into consideration, in particular for
combinations using rucaparib.
In spite of the biological relevance of the lowmicromolar off-target affinities identified, one may argue
that their true clinical significance is unclear due to the
fact that the peak plasma concentration of PARP drugs is
likely to be well below the IC50 values obtained for those
kinases. For example, the highest peak concentration for
a 50 mg single daily dose of veliparib is estimated to be
around 1 µM [32]. Under these conditions, none of the
two off-target affinities identified for veliparib (17 µM
for PIM1 and 8.2 µM for CDK9) could be considered
clinically relevant. However, a recent clinical study
reported that a rather wide range of dose regimes is
currently being explored in a phase I trial of veliparib,
with maximum doses up to 400 mg twice daily [33]. With
veliparib doses up to 8 times higher than the original dose,
any off-target affinity close to 8 µM, such as the one for
CDK9, may now become clinically relevant. In the case
of rucaparib, its initial highest peak plasma concentration
corresponding to a 40 mg single daily dose is estimated
to be around 2 µM [34]. Under this regime, at least three
kinases should be already considered clinically relevant
off-targets for rucaparib, namely, PIM1, CDK1, and
DYRK1A. However, in data presented at the last ASCO
meeting [35], an ongoing phase I dose-escalation study
of continuous oral rucaparib in patients with advanced
solid tumors is using doses of up to 480 mg twice daily.
Again, with rucaparib doses of up to 12 times higher than
the original dose, all nine off-target affinities for kinases
should be considered clinically relevant. It seems thus
clear that off-target kinase affinities of PARP inhibitors
should definitely be regarded as clinically relevant and
thus be considered for establishing recommended phase II
doses for rucaparib and veliparib.

DISCUSSION
The differential kinase polypharmacology among
PARP drug candidates offers a reasonable explanation
for some of the differences observed in their cellular
effects [5–7]. For example, the unique capacity of
rucaparib to inhibit STAT3 phosphorilation at 5 µM [6]
could be ascribed to its micromolar affinity for DYRK1A
and/or CDK1, both direct phospohorilators of STAT3
[17,18]. In contrast, these kinases are not inhibited by
olaparib or veliparib and, consequently, these drugs do
not affect the phosphorilation state of STAT3. Similarly,
CDK1 and PIM1 both regulate G2/M transition [18,19],
providing a rational for the higher capacity of rucaparib
to produce G2/M cell cycle arrest [6]. Moreover, kinase
phosphorilation at the zinc-finger 1 domain of PARP-1
has been postulated as a regulatory mechanism to disrupt
PARP-DNA binding [20], a plausible explanation to the
different capacity of PARP inhibitors to trap PARP-1 at the
DNA damage site at micromolar concentrations [7, 21].
Finally, it is worth stressing the low-affinity interaction
identified between rucaparib and ALK (IC50 = 18 µM),
which might partially explain the increased efficacy of
rucaparib in cancer cells with alterations in ALK [8]. To
the best of our knowledge, this represents the first example
of a genomic biomarker of response being a confirmed
off-target of the drug.
The experimental confirmation that PARP drug
candidates have a unique and differential off-target profile
across multiple kinases known to be involved in cancerrelevant processes provides a completely new perspective
of PARP inhibitors in clinical trials. Some of the new
affinities identified may offer opportunities for expanding
the current clinical scope of PARP inhibitors, just like
other off-targets have led to new indications of cancer
drugs [22]. For instance, PIM1 overexpression in a number
of hematopoietic cancers could promote the clinical
investigation of rucaparib in acute myeloid leukemia [19].
In this sense, the recent profile of a drug panel across AML
patient samples shows unexpected different sensitivity of
different PARP drugs across samples, with some samples
being sensitive only to rucaparib and others to olaparib
[23]. Also, some of these kinases could help to identify the
patient population that is responding to PARP inhibitors
despite being BRCA mutation-negative [3], for example
by including ALK as a biomarker of rucaparib response.
But most importantly, due to known synergistic
effects between PARPs and kinases [15], compounds
generally referred to as PARP inhibitors may not be
considered as clinically equivalent anymore. This
has significant implications for the direct transfer of
conclusions derived from clinical data obtained using
one PARP inhibitor to another one, with special impact

We may have just scratched the surface of the offtarget pharmacology linked to PARP inhibitors but we
have learned enough to realize that they have a clear and
differential kinase pharmacology beyond their primary
PARP targets. Recent clinical trials are resurrecting
the interest on PARP inhibitors, despite ignoring the
existence of a wealth of additional interactions outside the
PARP target space [3]. In the view of the data presented
here, we urgently need a broader understanding of the
mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors to guide their
clinical development. Our results are indicative of the
clear need for a wide pre-clinical target profiling of PARP
inhibitors across at least a diversity panel of kinases
to clarify whether the results from clinical studies on
one PARP inhibitor can be transferred to other PARP
inhibitors. What appeared as a single robust class of PARP
inhibitors with similar pharmacological properties [3]
should now be regarded as a promising set of compounds
with high affinity for PARPs but linked also to a rich
polypharmacology across multiple off-targets that makes
them essentially unique and thus expands largely their
potential therapeutic opportunities.

Taking PIM1 as a reference kinase based on
previous findings [10], we used a recently reported
computational approach to organize proteins by ligand
similarity [36] to identify 15 kinases for which more than
60% of their active ligands (pIC50 > 5) known in publicly
available repositories [12] were also known to be active
on PIM1. From these kinases, we selected the 11 that
were available for screening at Cerep (www.cerep.fr).
The selection included members of three different kinase
groups distantly related by sequence (all having less than
20% sequence identity with PIM1), namely, CAMK
(PIM2, STK17A), CMGC (DYRK1A, CDK9, HIPK2,
CK2, and CDC7) and AGC (AKT3, PRKCG, PRKCI, and
PKA). To this list, we added also two kinases belonging
to the TK group that have been identified as biomarkers of
PARP drug sensitivity [8] and shared ligands with PIM1,
namely, ABL and ALK. The final list was complemented
with two additional kinases reported to interact with
rucaparib, namely, CDK1 and PRKD2 [12,13]. In the end,
a total of 16 protein kinases were selected for a focused in
vitro screening of PARP inhibitors.
