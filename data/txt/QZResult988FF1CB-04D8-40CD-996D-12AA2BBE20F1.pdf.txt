Abstract
Glucose deprivation, a cell condition that occurs in solid
tumors, activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). A key
feature of the UPR is the transcription program activation,
which allows the cell to survive under stress conditions. Here,
we show that the UPR transcription program is disrupted
by the antidiabetic biguanides metformin, buformin, and
phenformin depending on cellular glucose availability. These
drugs inhibit production of the UPR transcription activators
XBP1 and ATF4 and induce massive cell death during glucose
deprivation as did the antitumor macrocyclic compound
versipelostatin. Gene expression profiling shows remarkable
similarity in the modes of action of biguanides and versipelostatin determined by the broad range of glucose deprivation-inducible genes. Importantly, during glucose deprivation,
most of the biguanide suppression genes overlap with the
genes induced by tunicamycin, a chemical UPR inducer. Gene
expression profiling also identifies drug-driven signatures as
a tool for discovering pharmacologic UPR modulators. Our
findings show that disrupting the UPR during glucose
deprivation could be an attractive approach for selective
cancer cell killing and could provide a chemical genomic basis
for developing UPR-targeting drugs against solid tumors.

Introduction
Cell conditions that lead to the accumulation of misfolded or
unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activate the
unfolded protein response (UPR; refs. 1, 2). The UPR is a complex
signaling network that enhances cell survival by limiting the
accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER (1, 2). A
key feature of the UPR is its transcription program activation,
which is initiated through signaling of the ER-localized transmembrane proteins ATF6, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and inositolrequiring 1 (IRE1; refs. 1, 2). These ER stress sensor proteins produce
several different active transcription factors. ATF6 becomes an
active transcription factor by proteolytic cleavage (3, 4), whereas
IRE1 mediates the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA, thereby
converting it to a potent UPR transcriptional activator (5–8). PERK
induces the transcription factor ATF4 by phosphorylating eIF2a
and transiently inhibiting general protein synthesis (9–11). These

transcription factors lead to coordinated induction of divergent
UPR target genes, such as the ER-resident molecular chaperones
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and 94 (GRP94), for cell
survival (12, 13). In the case of intolerable levels of ER stress,
however, the sensor proteins can contribute to eliciting apoptosis
(1, 2).
One of the major physiologic cell conditions leading to UPR
activation is glucose deprivation, which is associated with several
human diseases including tissue ischemia and cancer (14). The
UPR is thought to protect tumor cells from the stressful conditions
of glucose deprivation and hypoxia as well as from immune
surveillance (12, 15). Consistently, the elevated levels of GRP78 are
seen in a variety of cancer cell lines, solid tumors, and human
cancer biopsies and can be associated with lowered chemosensitivity in breast cancer and gliomas (16, 17). Thus, the UPR may
be an important target by which to improve cancer chemotherapy.
We recently isolated a novel macrocyclic compound, versipelostatin, which shows highly selective cytotoxicity to glucose-deprived
tumor cells and exerts in vivo antitumor activity (18). Versipelostatin inhibits GRP78 induction and represses the production of the
UPR transcription activators XBP1 and ATF4 during glucose
deprivation. However, it is not known to what extent versipelostatin affects the glucose deprivation-induced stress response to
exert the selective cytotoxicity.
Gene expression profiling has been used to characterize the UPR
in cell lines defective in such ER stress signaling genes as PERK,
eIF2a, ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1 (11, 19–21). Interestingly, each defect
has a different effect on the UPR transcription program as well as
on cell survival during ER stress, suggesting that gene expression
profiling would be useful to define the nature of the perturbation
induced by UPR-modulating compounds. Meanwhile, recent
studies revealed that gene expression profiling can also be used
in drug discovery. Notably, the Connectivity Map system has
successfully identified functional similarity between seemingly
diverse compounds by detecting similarities among gene expression profiles of cellular responses to a large number of bioactive
compounds (22–24). Thus, gene expression profiling with UPRmodulating compounds may provide useful information for drug
discovery.
In the course of screening for UPR modulators, we found that
the antidiabetic biguanides metformin, buformin, and phenformin
could inhibit activation of a GRP78 promoter reporter during
glucose deprivation. Among these biguanides, metformin has been
most widely used to treat type 2 diabetes (25, 26). Metformin lowers
blood glucose levels probably by activating the AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK; refs. 25, 26). In fact, metformin activates
AMPK at millimolar levels in various cultured cells (27, 28).
Recently, metformin was shown to exert antitumor effects in vitro
and in vivo via AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent pathways

(27, 28). However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood. Here, we show that the antidiabetic biguanides,
similar to versipelostatin, modulate the UPR transcription program
and induce cell death in glucose-deprived tumor cells. The modes
of action of biguanides and versipelostatin are very similar as
shown on biochemical analysis and gene expression profiling.
Furthermore, we show that the gene expression signatures,
identified with biguanides and versipelostatin, can be successfully
used in discovery of novel UPR-targeting drugs.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Versipelostatin was prepared as a stock solution of
10 mmol/L in DMSO (18). Metformin (Sigma), phenformin (Sigma),
buformin (Wako), and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG; Sigma) were dissolved in
sterilized distilled water at stock concentrations of 1 mol/L, 100 mmol/L,
100 mmol/L, and 2 mol/L, respectively. Tunicamycin (Nacalai Tesque),
pyrvinium pamoate (MP Biomedicals), and MG132 (Peptide Institute) were
dissolved in DMSO at stock concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 10 mmol/L, and
10 mmol/L, respectively. All the stock solutions were stored at -20jC. DMSO
represented <0.5% of the medium volume.

Cell lines and cell treatments. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
(Nissui; for human colon cancer HT-29, fibrosarcoma HT1080, stomach
cancer MKN74, and renal cell carcinoma 786-O) or DMEM (Nissui; for
HeLa). Both media, containing 2 mg/mL glucose, were supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 Ag/mL kanamycin. All cell
lines were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
as the normal growth condition.
To induce the UPR, we treated cells for various times under ER stress
conditions by replacing the medium with glucose-free medium or by adding
either 2DG or tunicamycin to glucose-containing medium. The glucose-free
RPMI 1640 and DMEM (Invitrogen) were supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (29). Versipelostatin, biguanides, or
pyrvinium pamoate were added at various final concentrations immediately
after cells were placed in glucose-free medium or just before the chemical
stressors were added to glucose-containing culture medium. In some
immunoblot analyses, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 at 10 Amol/L during exposure to the UPR inducers.
Cell viability assays. For the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, HeLa cells were cultured overnight in 96-well
plates (3  103 per well) and then treated with various concentrations of
versipelostatin, biguanides, or pyrvinium pamoate in the presence or
absence of 10 mmol/L 2DG or 1 Ag/mL tunicamycin as a stressor for 30 h.

Biguanides Inhibit the UPR during Glucose Deprivation
The medium was then replaced with fresh growth medium, and cells were
cultured for a further 15 h. Subsequently, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added to the culture medium,
and the absorbance of each well was determined as described previously
(30). Relative cell survival (mean F SD of quadruplicate determinations)
was calculated by setting each of the control absorbance from non-drugtreated cells as 100%.
For the colony formation assay, HT-29 cells were cultured overnight
in 24-well plates (4  104 per well) and then treated with various
concentrations of phenformin or buformin in normal or glucose-free
medium for 24 h. Cells were then diluted in fresh medium that lacked
biguanides, reseeded, and cultured under normal growth conditions to
form colonies as described previously (29). The cell viability (mean F SD
of triplicate determinations) was calculated by setting each of the nondrug-treated cell survivals as 100%.
Plasmids and transfection. The pcFLAG vector, pGRP78pro160-Luc,
and 7 FLAG-tagged ATF6 have been described previously (18, 31). The
FLAG-tagged XBP1-Luc plasmid was generated by ligating a FLAG-tagged
coding sequence and human XBP1 splicing region into the HindIII/ApaI
site of pGL4.13 plasmid vector (Promega) upstream of luciferase. The XBP1
splicing region encompassed nucleotides 410 to 633 relative to the start
of transcription of the human XBP1 cDNA, including the 26-nucleotide
ER stress-specific intron (5). The proper construction of plasmids was

confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections were done using
the FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with
antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reporter assay. Reporter assay was done as described previously
(ref. 18; see also Supplementary Methods). Briefly, HT1080 cells were
transfected with firefly luciferase-containing reporter plasmids
(pGRP78pro160-Luc or FLAG-tagged XBP1-Luc) and Renilla luciferasecontaining plasmid phRL-CMV (Promega) as an internal control. Relative
activity of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase (mean F SD of triplicate
determinations) was determined using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega).
Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was done as described
previously (ref. 18; see also Supplementary Methods). Briefly, equal amounts
of proteins were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and
transferred by electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes
were probed with the indicated primary antibodies. The specific signals
were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection system using
appropriate secondary antibodies (Perkin-Elmer).
Microarray expression profiles. Microarray analysis was done
according to standard Affymetrix protocols using GeneChip Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (see also Supplementary Methods). The
microarray data sets were deposited in the National Center for

In the glucose deprivation data set (including 16 samples) and the
versipelostatin/biguanide data set (including 10 samples), 2,253 and 118
significant probe sets were selected with false discovery rates of 0.5% and
20%, respectively. The list of paired sample data for each Significance

Glucose Deprivation signature, 246 of significant probe sets were selected
with the fold change cutoff of >2-fold up and down. As the versipelostatin/
biguanide signature, 25 of significant probe sets were selected with the fold
change cutoff of >2-fold up and >1.67-fold down. In the latter analysis, the
cutoff value for fold change was set at 1.67-fold in the down-regulated genes
because, for the 2-fold cutoff value, we could not obtain the probe sets
(down tags) necessary for Connectivity Map analysis.

Results
Cytotoxicity and UPR inhibition by biguanides during
glucose deprivation. To facilitate comparison of the cytotoxic
activity of small compounds under normal and UPR-inducing
stress conditions, we established a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide-based assay system using HeLa cells
(Fig. 1). We used two different types of chemical UPR inducers, the
hypoglycemia-mimicking agent 2DG and the N-glycosylation
inhibitor tunicamycin. In agreement with our previous study (18),
versipelostatin showed selective cytotoxicity under 2DG stress
conditions (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the antidiabetic biguanides phenformin, metformin, and buformin showed selective cytotoxicity
under 2DG stress conditions (Fig. 1B ). Notably, the IC50
(concentration reducing cell survival by 50%) values of phenformin
and buformin were f30-fold lower under 2DG stress than under

Biguanides Inhibit the UPR during Glucose Deprivation

normal growth conditions. In contrast to 2DG, tunicamycin
showed no combined effect of the biguanides. When colon cancer
HT-29 cells were treated with phenformin and buformin in glucosefree medium, a similar sensitization to these biguanides occurred
as shown by a colony formation assay (Fig. 1C and D).
We next compared the effects of biguanides and versipelostatin
on human GRP78 promoter activity in HT1080 cells that were
transiently transfected with the reporter gene plasmid pGRP78
pro160-Luc (18). As shown in Fig. 2A, treatments of the transfected
cells with 2DG and tunicamycin increased GRP78 promoter activity
by f5- and 6-fold, respectively. Both biguanides and versipelostatin suppressed 2DG-induced GRP78 promoter activity in a dosedependent manner but had little effect on tunicamycin-induced
GRP78 promoter activity. The inhibition concentrations were the
same ranges noted when cytotoxic activities were observed in 2DGstressed HeLa cells (Fig. 1). Biguanides also suppressed GRP78
promoter activity induced by glucose withdrawal (Fig. 2B). The
UPR-inhibitory activities of biguanides were also confirmed by
immunoblot analysis of endogenous GRP78 and GRP94 (Fig. 3).
Biguanides selectively and dose-dependently suppressed 2DGinduced GRP78 and GRP94 protein accumulation when HeLa cells
were treated with 2DG or tunicamycin for 18 h in the presence or
absence of biguanides (Fig. 3A and B). We saw similar results in

HT1080 during glucose withdrawal and in 2DG-stressed HT-29 cells
(Fig. 3C and D). The UPR-inhibitory activities of both biguanides
and versipelostatin were seen in cells stressed with either 2DG or
glucose withdrawal.
Effects of biguanides on upstream signaling pathways of the
UPR. We examined the effects of biguanides on the PERK-eIF2aATF4 signaling pathway in HT1080 and 786-O cells that were
stressed with 2DG for 18 h (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot analysis clearly
detected 2DG-induced PERK activation in 786-O cells but less
clearly in HT1080 cells as shown by phosphorylation-mediated
band shifts (9). Adding biguanides as well as versipelostatin did
not affect 2DG-induced PERK activation, although these compounds effectively suppressed GRP78 and GRP94 induction. The
same treatments did not affect 2DG-induced enhancement in
eIF2a phosphorylation in 786-O cells but suppressed it in HT1080
cells. At the 6 h time point, however, 2DG-induced eIF2a
phosphorylation was not inhibited in HT1080 cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast to the complicated response of eIF2a
phosphorylation, 2DG-induced ATF4 expression was consistently
suppressed by biguanides and versipelostatin at either 6 or 18 h time
point (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S1). Paradoxically, in the absence
of 2DG, both biguanides and versipelostatin induced ATF4 protein
accumulation.

We examined whether biguanides inhibited ATF6 and IRE1XBP1 signaling pathways (Fig. 4B and C). First, HT1080 cells
were transiently transfected with the plasmid of 7FLAG-tagged
ATF6, so that the ATF6 activation process was detected in a
2DG stress-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Production of the
p50ATF6/active form was somewhat decreased by biguanides as
well as by versipelostatin (Fig. 4B). Next, HT1080 cells were
transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding a fusion
protein of a XBP-1 fragment and luciferase, which produces
luciferase activity only when the 26 bp of the XBP-1 fragment
mRNA is spliced out by IRE1 during ER stress. Treatments of the
transfected cells with 2DG and tunicamycin increased luciferase
activity from the fusion reporter by f8- and 4-fold, respectively
(Fig. 4C). Under normal growth conditions, biguanides and
versipelostatin suppressed 2DG-induced, but not tunicamycininduced, reporter activity without affecting the basal activity
(Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results indicated that biguanides and
versipelostatin exhibited very similar effects on upstream
signaling pathways of the UPR depending on the glucose
deprivation conditions.
The antidiabetic action of metformin has reportedly been
associated with activation of AMPK (25, 26). We then examined
the effects of biguanides and versipelostatin on AMPK phosphorylation status in HT1080 and HeLa cells, the latter being negative
for LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK (36, 37). As shown in
Fig. 4D, combined treatments with 2DG and biguanides tended to
enhance phosphorylation of AMPK in HT1080 cells, whereas the
treatments tended to decrease levels of both total expression and
AMPK phosphorylation in HeLa cells. An exception we observed
was the strong AMPK phosphorylation enhancement in HT1080
cells treated with 2DG and versipelostatin. Thus, biguanides and
versipelostatin showed less consistent effects on AMPK than on the
UPR signaling pathways.
Gene expression signature of glucose deprivation with UPR
modulators. We obtained gene expression profiles from four
different cancer cell lines (HT1080, HT-29, HeLa, and MKN74)
that were treated for 15 or 18 h with various combinations of
stressors (glucose withdrawal, 2DG, or tunicamycin) and modulator compounds (biguanides or versipelostatin; see Supplementary
Table S1). The exposure periods were sufficient to activate the UPR
but not long enough to cause apparent, overt cell death even in the
presence of biguanides and versipelostatin. We first identified an
expression signature that captured the cellular response on glucose
deprivation. Following the Significance Analysis of Microarray, 178
genes (246 probe sets), termed the Glucose Deprivation signature,
were identified as differentially expressed genes that were either
up-regulated (97 genes or 148 probe sets) or down-regulated
(81 genes or 98 probe sets; Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S3) by
glucose withdrawal and 2DG. Analyzing 16 of 178 genes with realtime reverse transcription-PCR showed an excellent correlation
between microarray and reverse transcription-PCR (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Categorical analysis of the up-regulated genes
revealed enrichment of stress response and UPR-related categories,
such as ER, unfolded protein binding, disulfide isomerase, and
chaperone (see Supplementary Table S5). The 97 up-regulated
genes also contained the UPR markers GRP78 and GRP94 and
transcription factor XBP1 with relatively high scores. Categorical
analysis of the 81 down-regulated genes revealed enrichment of cell
cycle, cell division, and DNA replication categories (see Supplementary Table S5). The genes of the Glucose Deprivation signature
in cells treated with tunicamycin, another UPR inducer, showed

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

expression change similar to cells treated with glucose deprivation
(Fig. 5A; see also Supplementary Fig. S3). In the 148 up-regulated
probe sets, 92 (62.2%) probe sets were also >2-fold up-regulated by
tunicamycin-treatment (Fig. 5B). The 98 down-regulated probe sets
were weakly influenced by tunicamycin, but 76 (77.6%) probe sets
were >1.43-fold down-regulated.
As shown in the heat map, induction of the Glucose Deprivation
signature genes was largely prevented when biguanides and
versipelostatin were added under 2DG stress or glucose withdrawal
conditions (Fig. 5A). In the up-regulated 148 probe sets, induction
of 81 (54.7%) probe sets were effectively inhibited (the inhibition
efficiency >50%) in the presence of biguanide or versipelostatin. By
contrast, in the down-regulated 98 probe sets, most of the probe
sets (92 probe sets, 93.9%) were just slightly affected by the
addition of these compounds (Fig. 5C). In agreement with the
marginal effect of versipelostatin on the tunicamycin-induced UPR
(see above), the expression patterns of the Glucose Deprivation
signature genes were essentially the same between tunicamycintreated cells in the presence or absence of versipelostatin (Fig. 5A).
Taken together, these results show that biguanides and versipelostatin similarly and broadly modulate the transcription program of
the stress response, especially the UPR during glucose deprivation.
Gene expression signature-based identification of UPR
modulators. To investigate the utility of our gene expression data
further, we employed the Connectivity Map, a software tool that
searches for similarities between the expression signature of
interest and a reference collection of expression profiles that were
obtained from cell lines treated with various drugs (22). On
querying the Connectivity Map, the Glucose Deprivation signature
showed strong similarity to expression profiles of known UPR
inducers, including 7-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin,
ionomycin, 2DG, and MG132 (data not shown). To identify novel
UPR inhibitors using the Connectivity Map, we next extracted from
our microarray data a common expression signature of cells
treated with biguanides and versipelostatin under normal growth
conditions (see Supplementary Fig. S4A; Supplementary Table S6).
This signature consisted of 24 genes (25 probe sets), of which
10 genes (11 probe sets) overlapped with the Glucose Deprivation
signature. The 9 up-regulated genes contained DDIT3/GADD153/
CHOP, VEGFA, CEBPG, and TRB3, which are known as a
downstream target of ATF4, consistent with the observation that
ATF4 protein induction occurred in cells treated with versipelostatin and biguanides under normal growth conditions (Fig. 4A).
The Connectivity Map revealed similarity between the newly
defined versipelostatin/biguanide signature and the expression
profiles of some bioactive drugs (see Supplementary Table S7).
Among those drugs, we focused on an antihelmintic pyrvinium
pamoate that showed a high-ranked match for the versipelostatin/
biguanide signature with high specificity in the Connectivity Map
analysis regardless of whether we considered different cell lines
(see Supplementary Fig. S4B; Supplementary Table S7). Besides,
pyrvinium pamoate has been reported to be more toxic under
glucose starvation than under normal growth conditions and to
exert antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer xenografts (38).
However, little is known about its underlying mechanisms for
selective toxicity against glucose-starved cells. To examine the
effectiveness of the Connectivity Map-based screening, we tested

Biguanides Inhibit the UPR during Glucose Deprivation

HT1080 cells revealed that pyrvinium pamoate suppressed 2DGinduced but not tunicamycin-induced GRP78 promoter activity
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the effects of
pyrvinium pamoate and versipelostatin on the Glucose Deprivation
signature were quite similar in 2DG-stressed HT1080 cells (Fig. 6C).
Consistently, pyrvinium pamoate selectively suppressed 2DGinduced and glucose withdrawal-induced GRP78, GRP94, and
ATF4 protein accumulation in HT1080 cells (Fig. 6D), indicating
that it was also the same class of UPR-modulating compound as
versipelostatin.

Discussion
We have characterized, herein, UPR-modulating activities of
several compounds, including the antidiabetic biguanides metformin, buformin, and phenformin and an antihelmintic pyrvinium
pamoate, in addition to versipelostatin. In spite of differences in
chemical structure and known pharmacologic actions, these
compounds similarly and broadly modulate the transcription

program of the 2DG- and glucose withdrawal-induced UPR as
seen in the Glucose Deprivation signature. We noted that these
compounds show selective cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation,
indicating that modulation of the Glucose Deprivation signature is
associated with cell death as a result of the drug treatment.
The common feature of these compounds is that the mode of
action depends strictly on glucose deprivation. This raises the
possibility that the UPR during glucose deprivation is governed
by regulation mechanisms other than those initiated by the ERtransmembrane sensor proteins ATF6, IRE1, and PERK because
these sensor proteins are commonly activated under glucose
deprivation and tunicamycin stress conditions. Alternatively, the
modes of action of the UPR-modulating drugs could differ
depending on cellular glucose availability. Indeed, in the presence
of glucose, biguanides as well as versipelostatin were able to
induce the accumulation of an UPR transcription factor ATF4
protein, whereas they suppressed ATF4 induction during glucose
deprivation (Fig. 4A). Because ATF4 induction occurs under different stress conditions (39), this observation raises the possibility

In the pie charts (B and C ), the number of probe sets is within each slice. Increased, up-regulated 148 probe sets; Decreased, down-regulated 98 probe sets of the

that biguanides and versipelostatin could stimulate another stress
signaling pathway(s). In turn, ATF4 induction may explain why parts
of the UPR target genes, such as DDIT3/GADD153/CHOP, VEGFA,
CEBPG, and TRB3, were induced by these drugs under normal
growth conditions.
It has been reported that the antidiabetic action of biguanides is
associated with activation of the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway
(36, 37). However, the LKB1-AMPK pathway seems not to be
essential in order for the drugs to modulate the UPR transcription
program during glucose deprivation. Indeed, these drugs disrupted
the UPR and exerted cytotoxic activity during glucose deprivation
even in HeLa cells that are LKB1 defective. In addition, we showed
that AMPK regulation in response to biguanides under 2DG stress
conditions appeared to be different in HeLa and HT1080 cells
(Fig. 4D), although UPR inhibition was commonly seen in both cell
lines. Nevertheless, it is possible that the LKB1-AMPK pathway
plays a role in cell survival during glucose deprivation. It is
important to note that the cellular functions of AMPK show
considerable overlap with those of the UPR. AMPK, which can be
activated during glucose deprivation (25, 40, 41), induces downregulation of protein translation and cell division processes, which

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

is also seen as the protective cellular response to UPR activation
(2). Thus, the LKB1-AMPK pathway may enhance or compensate
for the protective role of the UPR, especially when the UPR is
suppressed. HeLa cells consistently exhibited hypersensitivity to
cytocidal action of biguanides and versipelostatin during glucose
deprivation, so it was necessary to reduce the concentrations of
these compounds in the microarray analysis compared with
HT1080 cell analysis (see Supplementary Table S1).
Recent advances in chemical genomics have revealed that a gene
expression signature is useful for drug discovery, even when
molecular targets or biochemical mechanisms of drugs are unclear
(22–24). In this regard, the present study succeeded in identifying
two types of gene expression signatures, the Glucose Deprivation
signature and the versipelostatin/biguanide signature that could be
used in Connectivity Map-assisted drug discovery. The versipelostatin/biguanide signature can be applied for compounds that cause
cytotoxic modulation of the UPR during glucose deprivation as
proven by experimentation with pyrvinium pamoate (Fig. 6). This
was further supported by a recent report showing that pyrvinium
pamoate suppressed the UPR in certain cell lines under glucose
withdrawal conditions (42). At present, it is not known whether

Biguanides Inhibit the UPR during Glucose Deprivation

there are common molecular targets of pyrvinium pamoate,
biguanides, and versipelostatin that could disrupt the UPR
transcription program, thus indicating the usefulness of the gene
expression signature-based drug discovery approach. Further
support of the versipelostatin/biguanide signature usefulness is
the finding that, according to Connectivity Map analysis, a
potassium ionophore valinomycin and a protein kinase C inhibitor,
rottlerin, were the high-ranked candidates for UPR-modulating
compounds (see Supplementary Table S6). In fact, during the
course of this study, valinomycin was shown to exert selective
cytotoxicity to 2DG-treated cancer cells through down-regulation
of GRP78 (43), and rottlerin was shown to suppress ER stressinduced autophagy, which is required for survival in response to ER
stress (44).
It is likely that disrupting the UPR transcription program during
glucose deprivation would be an attractive approach to cancer
treatment. In fact, glucose deprivation as well as hypoxia are
common features in poorly vascularized solid tumors but not
observed in normal tissue, thereby providing a rationale for
disrupting the UPR as a selective cancer therapy. Important to note
is that versipelostatin, metformin, phenformin, and pyrvinium
pamoate exert antitumor activity in xenograft models (18, 38,
45, 46). Although relative high concentrations of biguanides were
required to inhibit the UPR, they are in the same range as those
needed to activate AMPK in cultured cells (27, 28). The AMPK
activation is thought to play an important role in the antidiabetic
affects of biguanides. Interestingly, metformin treatment in
patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with a lower

risk of cancer (47, 48). Thus, UPR-disrupting compounds would be
interesting anticancer agent candidates. Meanwhile, depending on
the type of tumor, compounds that induce the UPR can also be
used as anticancer agents, for example, the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib and the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin analogues
(49, 50). In these scenarios, the gene expression signatures
identified in this study may be useful for drug discovery of both
UPR-suppressing and UPR-inducing anticancer agents. Not limited
to drug discovery, the gene expression signatures can support the
drug development process as biomarkers. In addition to cancer, the
UPR has recently been reported to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, and diabetes (1). The present findings,
therefore, could contribute to the development of UPR-targeting
therapy against cancer and other UPR-involved conditions.
