ABSTRACT
MYC oncoproteins deliver a potent oncogenic stimulus in several human cancers,
making them major targets for drug development, but efforts to deliver clinically
practical therapeutics have not yet been realized. In childhood cancer, aberrant
expression of MYC and MYCN genes delineates a group of aggressive tumours
responsible for a major proportion of pediatric cancer deaths. We designed a
chemical-genetic screen that identifies compounds capable of enhancing proteasomal
elimination of MYCN oncoprotein. We isolated several classes of compound that
selectively kill MYCN expressing cells and we focus on inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR
pathway in this study. We show that PI3K/mTOR inhibitors selectively killed MYCNexpressing neuroblastoma tumor cells, and induced significant apoptosis of transgenic
MYCN-driven neuroblastoma tumors concomitant with elimination of MYCN protein
in vivo. Mechanistically, the ability of these compounds to degrade MYCN requires
complete blockade of mTOR but not PI3 kinase activity and we highlight NVP-BEZ235
as a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor with an ideal activity profile. These data establish that
MYCN expression is a marker indicative of likely clinical sensitivity to mTOR inhibition,
and provide a rationale for the selection of clinical candidate MYCN-destabilizers likely
to be useful for the treatment of MYCN-driven cancers.

attractive targets for pharmacologic inhibition [1-7]. In
pediatric cancer, expression of MYCN is selectively
confined to tumor tissue in medulloblastoma [8],
neuroblastoma [1, 2], rhabdomyosarcoma [7], and a subset
of retinoblastoma [9], four common solid tumors that
together account for a substantial proportion of relapsed
cancer deaths in children. Pharmacologic inhibition
of MYCN oncoprotein is therefore of great interest in
pediatric cancer; however, direct targeting of MYCN, or
MYC oncoproteins in general, has not yet delivered viable
therapeutics to the clinic.
A substantial body of work suggests two approaches
by which MYC proteins could be therapeutically targeted.
First, synthetic lethal interactions are generated by
persistent overexpression of MYC in cancer cells and
impart therapeutic sensitivity [10-16]. Genetic screens
utilizing RNA-interference have identified relationships
between expression of MYC and a defined set of
additional genes, suppression of which induces lethality
restricted to cells with MYC or MYCN expression (CDK1,
CDK2, AURKA, AURKB, CHK1) [10-12, 17-23]. Second,
MYC-family oncoproteins are oncogenically stabilized by
altered phosphorylation within an N-terminal conserved
phosphodegron domain (CPD) [14, 24-26]. Binding to
the CPD is a function of the ubiquitin ligases (FBW7,
HUWE1) and is required for initiation of proteasomal
degradation [4, 24, 27]. Phosphorylation of conserved T58
and S62 residues within the CPD is regulated by CDK1
(a MAPK target), and by the PI3K/AKT-regulated targets
GSK3β and mTOR, respectively [28-30]. Cancers defined
by mutations in FBW7 (which disrupt the association of
FBW7 with the CPD-client protein) are characterized
by elevated levels of the CPD-client oncoproteins MYC
[31], c-Jun [32], cyclin E [33] and NOTCH [34]. Aberrant
stimulation of MAPK or PI3K pathways also contributes
to oncogenic stabilization of MYCN in certain cancers. In
neuroblastoma, enhanced PI3K signaling correlates with
poor prognosis and aggressive tumor biology [35, 36].
Previous work established that in cancer cell lines, excess
PI3K pathway signaling modulates the AKT-regulated
targets GSK3β and mTOR, extending the half-life of
MYC and outlining a potential pharmacologic approach
for targeting MYC stability [28-30, 34, 37].
To our knowledge, a chemical-genetic screen that
addresses these two mechanisms, corroborating previous
synthetic lethality studies of MYC oncogene expression or
providing the targets for MYC oncoprotein destabilization,
has not been reported. With this in mind, we designed a
cell-based screen utilizing an isogenically derived set of
neuroblastoma cells with either high-level expression of
wild-type MYCN or with genetically modified, stabilized
MYCN (lacking the CPD target phosphorylation residues,
T58 and S62). Potent compounds that have mechanistic
activity in cells expressing wild-type, but not CPD
mutated, MYCN protein should antagonize oncogenic
stabilization of MYCN protein and target synthetic lethal

relationships associated with MYCN expression. We
outline a strategy to identify compounds that specifically
target wild-type MYCN protein and present a chemical
screen that identifies small-molecules with the ability
to indirectly pharmacologically target MYCN (and
potentially MYC) protein. Compounds inhibiting several
genetic pathways were identified in the screen and in this
study we characterize small-molecule inhibitors of the
PI3K/mTOR pathway. We show that inhibitors of PI3K/
mTOR, or mTOR kinase activity alone, exhibit selective
activity against cells that express high-levels of MYCN
protein. NVP-BEZ235, a potent inhibitor of both PI3K
and mTOR-kinases, which is already in clinical trials for
PI3K pathway-mutated adult cancers, eliminated intratumoral MYCN and induced regression of MYCN-driven
transgenic neuroblastoma tumors in vivo.
Overall our observations raise the exciting
possibility that a group of poor-outcome pediatric cancers
could be effectively targeted through their expression of a
tumor-specific oncoprotein, using available and clinically
tested therapeutics.

RESULTS
Screen for small-molecules that target MYCN
oncoprotein stability
We designed a focused chemical-genetic screen
that would identify small-molecules with a mechanistic
ability to target cells expressing high-levels of wildtype MYCN. Expression constructs encoding FLAGtagged wild type or stabilized (CPD-mutated) MYCN
proteins were transfected into human neuroblastoma
cells lacking endogenous MYCN expression. Equivalent
levels of MYCN expression were achieved in SHEP cells
expressing wild-type MYCN (SHEP WT) in comparison
to a range of established, tumor-derived neuroblastoma
cell lines known to express high-levels of MYCN (Figure
S1A). However, elevated levels of MYCN expression
were observed in SHEP cells expressing mutated MYCN
(SHEP T58, SHEP S62 and SHEP T58/S62) in comparison
with both SHEP WT and established neuroblastoma cell
lines - consistent with the stabilization of CPD-mutated
MYCN (Figure S1A, B). SHEP cells expressing both wild
type and mutant MYCN proteins all exhibited significantly
increased cellular proliferation in comparison to parental
SHEP cells but not to each other (Figure S1C).
To establish the MYCN dependency of both the
native neuroblastoma cell line Kelly and the SHEP WT
and SHEP T58/S62 mutant MYCN lines, we abrogated
MYCN expression via siRNA-mediated knockdown.
Inhibition of MYCN in the Kelly cell line induced cell
death as measured by trypan blue exclusion (Figure
S1D) and similarly, although to a lesser extent, MYCN

cell viability was diminished with siRNA treatment in
both SHEP WT and SHEP T58/S62 neuroblastoma cell
lines (Figure S1E, F), confirming that exogenous MYCN
expression is responsible for the increased proliferation
observed in SHEP WT and SHEP T58/S62 cells.
Using cellular proliferation as an endpoint, we
selected for compounds with enhanced activity against
SHEP WT cells compared to SHEP T58/S62 cells
expressing stabilized MYCN. We reasoned that this
selection would enrich for compounds with mechanistic
activity against MYCN but exclude compounds with
generic activity related to inhibition of cell proliferation
rather than MYCN stability. The screen was performed
using an in-house kinase inhibitor library of 228
compounds at low, intermediate and high concentrations
(40nM, 200nM and 1μM) to identify compounds that
exhibit on-target effects whilst excluding the possibility of
off-target effects exerted by kinase inhibitors at excessive
concentrations (>1μM). The top 25 ranked inhibitors that
showed selective inhibition of SHEP WT cells included
inhibitors of JAK/STAT pathway, receptor tyrosine kinases
(PDGFR), PI3K pathway (PI3K, AKT and mTOR), and
cell cycle checkpoints (AURKA, AURKB, CDK, PLK,
WEE1 and CHK1) (Figure 1A).
The specificity of 17 of the inhibitors in this list
has been profiled against a panel of 300 protein kinases
[38]. Several demonstrate off-target activity, with 6 (JAK
Inhibitor I, SU6656, SU11652, JAK3 Inhibitor VI, PKR
Inhibitor and Aurora Kinase/Cdk Inhibitor) inhibiting >25
kinases by >75%, and a further 3 (PDGF RTK Inhibitor,
PDGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor IV and Cdk2
Inhibitor IV-NU6140) inhibiting >5 kinases. Of these, 5
had activity against both Aurora A and B (Jak inhibitor
I, SU6656, PDGF RTK inhibitor, PKR inhibitor, Aurora
kinase/CDK inhibitor), Aurora A (Cdk2 Inhibitor IVNU6140) or Aurora B (Jak3 VI inhibitor). The JAK
inhibitor I also inhibited CHK1 and PLK1, CHK1 was
also inhibited by SU11652 and the JAK3 VI inhibitor,
and CDK1 was inhibited by the JAK3 VI inhibitor, PKR
inhibitor and the Aurora Kinase/Cdk Inhibitor. The offtarget and on-target activity of several of these inhibitors
included AURA [12], AURB [39], CDK1 [10] and CHK1
[17] that have been reported to regulate MYCN stability
or exhibit a synthetic lethal interaction with MYCN
dependence. Our focused screen therefore appears to have
strong predictive ability to identify compounds that are
selective inhibitors of cells expressing MYCN protein.
This chemically driven screen appears to validate previous
RNAi driven loss-of-function studies, which highlighted
the potential for pharmacologic targeting of synthetic
lethal interactions in MYCN expressing cancers.

Potent and selective inhibitors of PI3K and/or
mTOR pathways have entered clinical trials in both adult
and pediatric cancers, and could be valuable agents for
treatment of childhood cancers [40, 41]. The fact that PI103, a potent and highly specific small-molecule inhibitor
of class I PI3K and mTOR [42-44] preferentially targeted
MYCN-expressing cells in our screen was of particular
interest to us. Preliminary studies demonstrated that
LY294002, a first-generation, weak inhibitor of PI3K
pathway that has off-target liabilities [45], destabilized
MYCN and could partially inhibit the growth of MYCNdriven neuroblastoma tumors [46] but its use was limited
by the off-target toxicity profile of LY294002, which
restricted in vivo dosing. Given the activity of PI-103 (a
more potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K signaling than
LY294002) in our focused screen, and the availability of
additional potent and selective PI3K inhibitors for clinical
use, we focused on the role of PI3K/mTOR signaling in
MYCN stability (Table S1).
We first re-confirmed our initial observation that
the proliferation of SHEP WT cells was preferentially
inhibited by PI-103 treatment using a trypan blue exclusion
assay (Figure 1B). SHEP WT cells exhibited a 4.8-fold
and 2.9-fold increased sensitivity to PI-103 compared to
the parent SHEP cells or SHEP T58/S62 respectively. This
differential sensitivity pattern was reproduced with NVPBEZ235 [47], an imidazo-[4,5-c]-quinoline derivative
PI3K and mTOR inhibitor (7.1 and 4.7-fold respectively),
and also with Torin1 [48], an ATP-competitive mTORkinase (mTORC1 and mTORC2) inhibitor lacking PI3K
inhibition, and to a lesser degree with ZSTK474 [49], a
pan class I PI3K inhibitor that has poor activity against
mTOR (3.8 and 3.2-fold respectively). In addition, the
native neuroblastoma Kelly cells also exhibited a similar
sensitivity profile as the SHEP WT cells (Figure 1B).
These results show a clear trend in drug sensitivity where
inhibition of cell proliferation aligns with the degree of
MYCN amplification and protein expression. Our findings
were reinforced both in an independent sulforhodamine B
(SRB) assay of cell proliferation, and also in a larger cell
panel that included four primary neuroblastoma cell lines
with MYCN gene amplification, three cell lines with diploid
MYCN and four engineered SHEP cell lines expressing
mutated or wild-type exogenous MYCN protein (Table
S2). Furthermore, TGX221, an isoform-selective p110βselective PI3K inhibitor and rapamycin, a non-ATP site
and incomplete inhibitor of mTOR (mTORC1-specific),
showed relatively non-specific activity against this panel.
The activity of NVP-BEZ235 and Torin1 against Kelly
and three additional MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell
lines correlated with induction of apoptosis in the Kelly
cell line by two independent assays (Figure 1D, 1E).
This data suggests that within the spectrum of available

neuroblastoma cell lines to PI3K/mTOR inhibition is
somewhat surprising, since these cells lack intrinsic
mutations in the PI3K pathway members PTEN or
PIK3CA. These mutations prime cells for response to
PI3K pathway inhibitors and therefore provided the
rationale for the initial use of these agents in clinical
trials [50-52]. To examine whether MYCN expressing
neuroblastoma cells exhibit similar sensitivity to cells
harboring intrinsic PI3K pathway mutations we used
NVP-BEZ235 to treat a range of adult cancer cell lines
(PTEN or PIK3CA mutant, with varying expression levels
of MYC [53-58]), together with pediatric cell lines (wildtype for PTEN and PIK3CA) but with varying expression
levels of either MYC or MYCN (Figure 1F). We found
that cell lines harboring no/intermediate expression of
MYCN or with stabilized MYCN were significantly
less sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 compared to both MYC
and MYCN-amplified cell lines (P < 0.0001). Therefore,
expression of MYCN is a marker of sensitivity to NVPBEZ235 treatment in pediatric cell lines and confers
sensitivity equivalent to that of adult cell lines mutated in
PTEN or PIK3CA. Taken together, the implication is that
expression of MYCN is a marker of sensitivity to PI3K/
mTOR pathway inhibition in neuroblastoma cells.
Having identified selective sensitivity of MYCNdependent cells to treatment with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors,
we examined whether this could be explained by an
intrinsic difference in PI3K pathway activation in these
cells. We used an electro-chemiluminescent assay
that quantitates PI3K/mTOR signaling intermediates
(AKTSER473, GSK3βSER9, p70S6KTHR389 and RPS6SER240/244)
to compare PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition in SHEP
cells with exogenous expression of either MYCN WT or
MYCN T58/S62 protein mutated within the CPD domain.
NVP-BEZ235 caused potent blockade of PI3K and mTOR
pathways in both SHEP WT and SHEP T58/S62 cell
lines (Figure 2A-2D). Therefore the variance in viability
between SHEP WT and SHEP T58/S62 cells following
treatment with NVP-BEZ235 is unlikely to be due to
differential inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathway activity.

mTORC1) and AKTSER473 (regulated by mTORC2) (Figure
2E, 2F). Compared to NVP-BE235 and Torin1, there was
no significant degradation of MYCN with ZSTK474
treatment, despite evidence of PI3K pathway inhibition
indicated by a decrease in AKTSER473 and GSK3βSER9
phosphorylation (Figure 2G). We confirmed these
observations in two other MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
cell lines, IMR5 and SKN-Be2C, which showed similar
patterns in sensitivity and biomarker modulation with all
three drug treatments (Figure 2H). Furthermore, we treated
the Kelly cell line at 2, 5 and 10μM with ZSTK474,
which at higher concentrations can be a weak inhibitor of
mTOR [59], and observed destabilization of MYCN, but
only where mTOR activity was modulated (as measured
through inhibition of both 4EBP1THR37/46 and RPS6SER240/244
(Figure 3A). Additionally, following cycloheximide
treatment, the half-life of MYCN was shortened by NVPBEZ235 and Torin1 but not by ZSTK474 (Figure 3B).
Taken together, these data imply that the ability of PI3K/
mTOR pathway inhibitors to eliminate MYCN protein
correlates with effective targeting of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 activity.

Blockade of mTOR stimulates proteasomal
degradation of MYCN protein
We next assessed whether the ability of mTORkinase inhibitors to eliminate MYCN exhibited
evidence of dependence on the ubiquitin-ligase,
proteasome degradation pathway. Treatment with the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in accumulation of
phosphorylated MYCN and reversed the ability of NVPBEZ235 to degrade MYCN protein (Figure 3C). NVPBEZ235 efficiently and rapidly eliminated exogenously
expressed MYCN-WT protein in SHEP WT cells (Figure
3D), an effect that was completely blocked by mutation
of the CPD-domain T58 and S62 phosphorylation sites,
despite evidence of excellent mTOR/PI3K pathway
inhibition (Figure 3E). This suggests that the ability of
PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors to eliminate MYCN is
mediated by phosphorylation of the N-terminal FBW7
target CPD domain, since mutation of phosphorylation
sites within the CPD completely reverses the ability of
these drugs to degrade MYCN (compare Figure 3D, 3E).
We therefore concluded that the elimination of MYCN
protein caused by mTOR/PI3K pathway blockade is at
least in part mediated through phosphorylation of MYCN
T58/S62 phospho-residues.

Degradation of MYCN protein correlates with
blockade of mTOR, not PI3K activity
We next sought to establish whether MYCNselective inhibition observed in cellular assays correlates
with elimination of MYCN protein, and if so, which
component of PI3K pathway blockade is required for
efficacy. To establish a time- and concentration-dependent
biomarker response in a native neuroblastoma cell line we
treated Kelly (MYCN-amplified, high MYCN protein) cells
with NVP-BEZ235 for 1, 3, 6 and 12 h. Treatment led to
a rapid (3 h) and sustained (12 h) elimination of MYCN
protein by NVP-BEZ235 and Torin1 accompanied by a
decrease in phosphorylation of 4EBP1THR37/46 (regulated by

play a major role in stabilization of MYCN protein in
neuroblastoma cells. To mechanistically address this
possibility, we silenced p110α-PI3K expression in
short- and long-term assays using siRNA and shRNA,
respectively. Elimination of p110α activity blocked
phosphorylation of AKT but failed to reduce cellular
MYCN protein levels (Figure 4A, 4B) or alter cell
proliferation (Figure 4C). In addition, the ability of
NVP-BEZ235 to stimulate MYCN degradation in these
cells (immunoblot Figure 4D, 4E) or their sensitivity to
treatment with NVP-BEZ235 (GI50, as measured by 72
h SRB cytotoxicity assay, Figure 4F) was not altered by
p110α knockdown, whereas sensitivity to treatment with

ZSTK474 was significantly (6-fold) reduced (Figure 4G).
This implies that the ability of combined PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors to degrade MYCN protein is not dependent on
intact p110β function, and furthermore that maintenance
of MYCN protein levels in these cells largely proceeds
through mTOR-dependent mechanisms.

Elimination of MYCN protein requires
concurrent inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2

mTORC1/mTORC2 respectively, most effectively targeted
MYCN in our studies, incomplete (rapalogue) inhibitors
of mTOR have been more commonly used in the clinical
setting. To establish if incomplete inhibition of mTORC1
alone could be effective in destabilizing MYCN we
used rapamycin at a low concentration, known to block
mTORC1 but not mTORC2 [60]. We were only able to
observe MYCN degradation using rapamycin at 10-20µM,
a concentration at which total blockade of both mTORC1
(as measured by p4EBP1THR37/46) and mTORC2 (as
measured by AKTSER473) occurs (Figure 5A). Similarly, the
PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 was only active against MYCN
at high concentrations coinciding with inhibition of both
mTORC1 (as measured by p4EBP1THR37/46 inhibition) and
mTORC2 (as measured by AKTSER473 inhibition, Figure
3A). Furthermore, transient suppression of mTOR using
siRNAs to target mTORC1 (RAPTOR) or mTORC2
(RICTOR) in Kelly cells partially reduced MYCN levels
and targeting of mTOR kinase completely eliminated
MYCN (Figure 5B, S2A-C), leading to rapid cell-

killing (Figure 5C). Taken together these data imply that
mTOR kinase plays a prominent role in the maintenance
of MYCN stability and that complete blockade of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 is required to efficiently stimulate
degradation of MYCN.

The mTOR complex modulates GSK3β activity
and regulates MYCN protein degradation
The beta isoform of glycogen synthase kinase
(GSK3β) is a PI3K/mTOR pathway component and
direct target of AKT that alters phosphorylation of
MYC oncoproteins at the CPD. Phosphorylation of the
CPD mediates complex formation between E3 ligases
and MYC proteins, driving their degradation within the
proteasome [61]. Activity of the mTORC2 (RICTOR/
mTOR) complex specifically stimulates AKTSER473
phosphorylation [62]. High levels of mTORC2 activity
lead to inactivation of GSK3β (preventing phosphorylation
of MYCN and proteasomal degradation). In our hands,

the ability of PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors (including
NVP-BEZ235 and Torin1) to efficiently target MYCN
required intact GSK3β activity (Figures 2 and 3). To test
this observation, we knocked-out GSK3β with siRNA.
Suppression of GSK3β increased stable intracellular
levels of MYCN (Figure S2D, E) and both genetic (Figure
5D) and pharmacologic (Figure 5E) inhibition of GSK3β
abrogated the ability of NVP-BEZ235, Torin1 (and other
PI3K or mTOR inhibitors, data not shown) to degrade
MYCN. These data establish that the mTOR complex, and
mTORC2 in particular, plays a critical role in maintenance
of cellular MYCN levels, requiring intact function of
GSK3β, the activity of which appears to be rate-limiting
for the ability of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to stimulate

MYCN degradation.

In vivo inhibition of mTOR-kinase targets
MYCN-driven tumors in animal models
A stringent test of whether MYCN destabilization is
a viable therapeutic strategy for MYCN-driven cancers is
to establish whether murine tumors genetically-engineered
to overexpress MYCN, together with primary human
neuroblastoma tissue amplified for MYCN, are targeted in
vivo. We assessed whether ZSTK474 and NVP-BEZ235
could inhibit tumor progression using a transgenic model
of neuroblastoma (TH-MYCN), in which tumor formation

responses (by RECIST criteria) in the majority of treated
tumors, with volume and mass reduction >75% (Figure
6A) translating to extension of survival (Figure 6B).
Conversely, ZSTK474 lacked any anti-tumor activity
(compare Figure 6A, 6B upper and lower panels) despite
achieving intra-tumoral concentrations sufficient for
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (Figure 6D). In
responding tumors, NVP-BEZ235 blocked both PI3K
(AKTSER473/308) and mTOR signaling (RPS6SER240/244),
resulting in almost complete elimination of MYCN protein
(Figure 6D), and induction of apoptosis (cleavage of
caspase 3) on immunoblot and by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 6D, 6E). Interestingly, two mice in the NVP-

21 days with 45mg/kg/day NVP-BEZ235 or 400mg/kg
ZSTK474 [59, 64]. Both treatments were well tolerated
(Figure S3A-C). Intra-tumoral levels of NVP-BEZ235
and ZSTK474 were verified by mass spectroscopy and the
drugs were present in tumor tissue above concentrations
required for inhibition of their respective targets (Figure
S3D). Tumor mass response following necropsy (Figure
6A) and extension of survival (Figure 6B) were assessed
as trial endpoints, and tumor regression was monitored
in vivo using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
(Figure 6C). Importantly, NVP-BEZ235 induced complete

Figure 7: Schematic model of regulatory pathways involved in MYCN turnover. In neuronal precursor cells, MYCN is initially

phosphorylated at serine 62 (S62) by cyclin-dependent kinase 1/CyclinB. This acts as a priming phosphorylation that permits binding of
GSK3β, PIN1 and PP2A. Subsequently, active GSK3β phosphorylates MYCN at threonine 58 (T58), yielding doubly phosphorylated
MYCN. In a MYCN driven cancer cell model, RTKs activate PI3K, and the downstream target AKT, localising it to the membrane
and allowing phosphorylation and activation of AKT at threonine 308 (T308) by PDK1. Active AKT phosphorylates and inactivates
GSK3β, blocking phosphorylation of MYCN therefore preventing proteasomal degradation. The mTORC1 complex (mTOR-raptor) also
directly phosphorylates and inhibits PP2A, enabling the accumulation of S62 phosphorylated and active MYCN. In addition, the mTORC2
complex (mTOR-RICTOR) phosphorylates and further activates AKT at serine 473 (S473). NVP-BEZ235 destabilizes MYCN by blocking
activation of AKT (via inhibition of TORC1 and TORC2 complexes) and reactivating GSK3β, permitting phosphorylation of MYCN (T58)
and initiating proteasomal degradation.

BEZ235 treatment cohort experienced incomplete
responses with partial tumor regression and progression,
respectively (T2 and T4, Figure S3A, B), and in each
case inhibition of PI3K (AKTSER473/308) and mTOR
(RPS6SER240/244) was incomplete, with only partial reduction
in MYCN levels (M2 and M4, Figure 6D). Consistent with
the idea that complete blockade of mTOR is a requirement
for therapeutic efficacy of PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors
in the setting of MYCN-dependency, ZSTK474 exhibited
little activity against mTOR signaling (RPS6SER240/244) and
demonstrated no therapeutic benefit in this MYCN-driven
model (Figure 6D).
To further confirm the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235
as a therapeutic for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in
patients, we performed an in vivo preclinical trial using
a primary xenograft model in which tumor tissue from
a patient (SFNB-08) with high-grade, MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma was implanted orthotopically into the
kidney capsule. Animals were treated with NVP-BEZ235
or vehicle for 14 days at 45mg/kg. Measurement of both
tumor volume and weight again showed a significant
decrease in tumor burden in NVP-BEZ235-treated animals
in comparison to vehicle (Figure S4A, B). Immunoblotting
of tumor tissue confirmed that NVP-BEZ235 blocked
PI3K (AKTSER473/308, GSK3βSER9) and mTOR signaling
(RPS6SER240/244, 4EBP1THR37/46) coincident with downregulation of intra-tumoral MYCN protein (Figure S4C).
In addition, Ki67 staining showed a significant reduction in
cellular proliferation (Figure S4D). Taken together, these
data illustrate the potency of the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
NVP-BEZ235 against two different MYCN-driven tumor
models, establish that the mechanism of action relates to
elimination of MYCN protein, and highlight the potential
for treatment of MYCN-driven malignancies in children
using clinically available inhibitors of mTOR.

mouse models [63, 65-75]. In this setting, repetitive
genetic inactivation of MYC causes regression of several
malignancies without evidence of acquired genetic
resistance, and with reversible toxicity to normal organs
[5, 76-79]. Collectively, these data underpin the rationale
for direct pharmacologic inhibition of MYC, however in
practice this has been difficult. Given the prominent role
of MYCN in the genesis of aggressive pediatric tumors,
we sought to identify existing therapeutics that could be
useful to target MYCN indirectly, using neuroblastoma as
a paradigm of a pediatric tumor that exhibits both clinical
and experimental evidence of dependence and addiction to
MYCN overexpression.
MYC-family proteins are oncogenically stabilized
by altered phosphorylation within an n-terminal conserved
phosphodegron domain (CPD). Binding to the CPD is a
function of the ubiquitin ligases (FBW7, HUWE1) and
is required for initiation of proteasomal degradation.
Phosphorylation of conserved T58 and S62 residues
within the CPD is regulated by CDK1 (a MAPK target),
and by the PI3K/AKT-regulated targets GSK3β and
mTOR, respectively (Figure 7). Based on knowledge of
this mechanism, individual compounds which modulate
GSK3β and target MYCN have been reported [13, 37, 80].
However, a comprehensive understanding of how PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors target MYC proteins and a rationale for
the selection of compounds likely to be clinically active
against MYC-driven cancers is lacking. Given that panPI3K, dual PI3K/mTOR and TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors
are progressing through early pediatric clinical evaluation,
it is important to clearly define the patient population
most likely to benefit from treatment and to prioritize
inhibitors for clinical trials [52, 81]. To date, none of these
compounds have been ranked for their potential to inhibit
MYC/MYCN in pediatric cancers, although several drugs
(rapamycin and the later generation rapalogue inhibitors
temsirolimus and ridaforolimus) have been evaluated in
the setting of relapsed solid tumors without a hypothesis
relating to MYC or MYCN expression.
A practical cell-based approach to rank compounds
with the ability to destabilize MYC protein would provide
a valuable roadmap to prioritize drugs for early phase
trials. We therefore designed a chemical-genetic screen
using isogenic (SHEP neuroblastoma) cells varying in
expression of wild-type or CPD-mutated, stabilized
MYCN, and we assessed selective sensitivity to treatment
with a library of 228 drugs or chemical probes [82, 83].
No statistically significant difference in proliferation
rate was observed between SHEP cells expressing wildtype or stabilized MYCN in this screen, excluding the
possibility that selective sensitivity related to changes in
basal proliferation rate. However, we cannot discount the
possibility that additional mechanisms associated with
MYCN overexpression, and unrelated to stabilization
of MYCN protein, could account for drug sensitivity in
this screen. For example, MYC protein overexpression

DISCUSSION
Oncogenic expression of MYC proteins is common
in adult cancers and also occurs in neuroblastoma [1,
2], medulloblastoma [8], rhabdomyosarcoma [7] and
retinoblastoma [9], four common pediatric solid tumors
that together account for a major fraction of death from
relapsed cancer in children. In these conditions, aberrant
expression of MYCN is associated with high-risk disease,
poor clinical prognosis and death due to metastatic relapse
(reviewed in [4]). The prominent role of MYC proteins
in oncogenesis, and the fact that MYCN expression is
restricted to tumor tissue in several pediatric malignancies
with poor outcome, implies that MYCN is likely to be
an important therapeutic target, presenting a unique
opportunity for targeted molecular therapeutic intervention
in pediatric cancer [4].
That particular cancers can be addicted to oncogenic
signaling changes induced by aberrant MYC expression
is well-established through the use of oncogene-regulated

has been linked to defects in apoptosis [84], altered DNA
damage repair responses [85], changes in chromosomal
stability [86] and cell metabolism [87]. Many of these
factors are the likely basis for previously described
synthetic lethal relationships associated with MYCN
expression. Nevertheless, we were able to identify several
classes of small molecule inhibitor that selectively target
cells expressing MYCN protein, and as proof-of-principle
we characterized one class of compound that demonstrated
considerable efficacy in two independent pre-clinical
models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. We illustrate the
feasibility of this mechanistic and translational approach
in identifying regulators of MYCN stability, focusing
on PI3K/mTOR and mTOR inhibitors as an effective
class and mitigating the risk of off-target effects by
using multiple inhibitors across the pathway, as well as
siRNA silencing of pathway components. We focus on
NVP-BEZ235 as an example of a selective PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor that is able to suppress MYCN protein and induce
growth-inhibitory effects in MYCN expressing cells,
although several candidate inhibitors are now in clinical
evaluation. From our data, the most effective inhibitors
induce total blockade of both mTORC1 and mTORC2,
which appear to regulate downstream processes that are
key in controlling MYCN protein levels and cellular
dependency on MYCN expression.
The basis for the relationship between MYCN
expression and sensitivity to mTOR inhibition is unclear,
but several possibilities are likely. In order to tolerate
oncogenic overexpression of MYC, cancer cells must
undergo a major remodeling of metabolic and translational
pathways˗ both of which are regulated by mTOR [87].
Indeed, MYC has previously been shown to be involved
in a feed-forward loop involving the translation machinery
component eIF4F that links transcription and translation,
regulating cell growth and protein synthesis [88, 89].
Uncoupling of this feed-forward loop via perturbations
in expression of key proteins including those under the
control of mTOR (such as 4EBP1) is a likely mechanism
that fuels cancer cell growth and cellular addiction to
MYC expression [16, 89-91]. Finally, neuroblastomas
with high levels of MYCN expression exhibit defined
metabolic deficiencies in glucose metabolism (Warburg
physiology) and are polyamine-dependent under hypoxic
conditions [92, 93]. MYC directly interacts with HIF-1
linking altered cellular metabolism to tumorigenesis by
regulating genes involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes,
mitochondria, and regulation of glucose and glutamine
metabolism [94, 95].
Advances in medicinal chemistry have delivered
potent small-molecules to clinical use that have the ability
to achieve effective in vivo blockade of major oncogenic
signaling pathways through either direct targeting of
oncoproteins or through synthetic lethal relationships
exposed by oncogene expression [83]. The availability
of multiple clinical inhibitors that target pathways of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

high relevance to cancer treatment mandates thorough
mechanistic prioritization. Here we show that within the
class of available inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR pathway,
compounds that selectively block mTORC1/mTORC2,
such as the combined PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235, efficiently target MYCN protein stability and
cause in vivo regression of neuroblastoma, a MYCNdriven pediatric tumor. Selective inhibitors of PI3K do
not exhibit this activity. This has important implications
for planned trials of these compounds in pediatric cancer,
since multiple PI3K, mTOR and dually targeted PI3K/
mTOR drugs are already in active clinical evaluation.
The success of pediatric trials utilizing these agents will
depend as much on careful selection of the appropriate
agent as on the target patient population likely to benefit
from treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Kelly, SH-SY5Y, SHEP, SK-N-SH, IMR32, SKNBe2C, IMR5 and SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cell
lines were obtained from the University of California
at San Francisco Cell Culture Facility (San Francisco,
CA) and from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in DMEM or RPMI
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA “Gold”). In
specified experiments, cells were serum starved in 0.2%
FCS for 6 h before analysis and treated with recombinant
human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; Sigma) at
50ng/mL for 30 min before harvesting. NVP-BEZ235
(Novartis), Torin1 (Nathaniel Gray), staurosporine (Alexis
Biochemicals), ZSTK474 (Alexis Biochemicals), GSK3β
inhibitor (Calbiochem), TGX221 (Selleck chemicals),
PIK90 (Selleck chemicals) and Rapamycin (Selleck
chemicals) were all prepared as a 10mM stock solution in
100% DMSO. Working solutions were prepared freshly by
dilution in 100% DMSO prior addition to the cell media
at a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO. SHEP cells were
stably transfected with constructs wild-type or mutant
for MYCN and appropriate clones were screened and
selected essentially as described previously [37]. Cells
were regularly screened for Mycoplasma using a PCRbased assay (VenorGem, Minerva Biolabs).

In vitro proliferation and inhibitor treatment
Cells were seeded in triplicate wells of 96-well flat
bottom culture plates (3-6 × 103 per well) and allowed
to attach for 24 h to ensure exponential growth at the
time of treatment. Cells were then incubated for 72 h in
the presence of increasing concentrations of indicated
inhibitors. Cell viability and median-effect concentration

affecting growth (GI50) was determined using the SRB
(Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay) and GI50 values
were derived as described previously [96]. Apoptosis was
assessed by caspase cleavage. The activities of caspase-3
and -7 were measured by luminescence detection using
the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay kit (Promega, Inc.). The assay
provides a luminogenic caspase-3/7 substrate in a reagent
that when added to cells results in cell lysis, followed
by caspase cleavage of the substrate and generation of a
luminescent signal produced by luciferase. The assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The mean difference was calculated using Student’s
t-test. Values were standardized to the maximal effect of

Transfection of Kelly neuroblastoma cells with
siRNA
MYCN, GSK3β, mTOR, RAPTOR or RICTOR
single or SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) and PI3KP110α single siRNA (Ambion) was introduced into the
cells by complex formation with Lipofectamine 2000 lipid
transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to transfection
recommendations of the manufacturer. Lentiviral
packaging vectors pMD2.G (3µg), pMDLg/pRRE (5µg),
pRSV-REV (2.5µg) (Addgene) and the MYCN shRNA
vector (10µg, TRCN0000020696, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) or
control shRNA vector (10µg, SHC002 Sigma-Aldrich),
also in complex with lipofectamine, were transfected into
the HEK293T packaging cell line seeded in T75cm2 tissue
culture flasks. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the
culture media were replaced by fresh media corresponding
to the cell line being transduced. After another 24 h of
incubation, the lentiviral particle containing media were
clarified by centrifugation and passed through a Millex
HV 0.45 μm PVDF filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
The viral titre was calculated using the HIV p24 ELISA
(Cambridge Biosciences) and viral aliquots stored at
-80oC. KELLY, SHEP WT and SHEP T58/S62 cells were
transduced with lentivirus at a calculated multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 10 (assuming 50% packaging
efficiency) in the presence of polybrene (4µg/ml). The
following day the virus-containing media were replaced
with normal growth media and 24 h later, knock down
cells were selected using puromycin (5µg/ml continuous
treatment for at least 1 week).

Kinase inhibitor screen
SHEP WT and SHEP T58/S62 were seeded in 384well plates for 48 hours before treatment with 40, 200 and
1000nM of 228 kinase inhibitors and chemical probes for
96 hours [82, 97-99]. Cell viability was determined using
CellTiter-blue reagent (Promega, Inc.). The Z-factor was
>0.5 for all plates analyzed. The data was plotted as a ratio
of SHEP T58/S62:SHEP WT.

Immunoblotting
Inhibitor-treated cells were lysed and suspended in
non-denaturing lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA) containing 1x concentrate protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Lewes, UK).
Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes, which were incubated in a blocking buffer
(5% dried milk in TBS or 3% ECL advance blocking
reagent) and probed with primary antibody in blocking
buffer overnight at 4°C. Proteins were detected with HRP
conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO) and visualized
with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE
Healthcare). Antibodies used were as follows: Rabbit anti

In vivo transgenic experiments
Transgenic TH-MYCN animals with palpable tumors
(40-80 days old) were randomized and treated with 45mg/
kg NVP-BEZ235, 400mg/kg ZSTK474, or vehicle. NVPBEZ235 and ZSTK474 were administered via oral gavage.
To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
profiles of NVP-BEZ235, plasma and tumor samples
were harvested at 1 hour and 6 hours following dosing.
Mice were bled by cardiac puncture, and plasma samples
were collected and frozen at −20°C until analysis. Tumors
were dissected, divided into 3 approximately equal
pieces, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis.
For pharmacodynamic studies, tumors were homogenized
using T-PER buffer™ (Thermo Scientific), 1x concentrates
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche,
Lewes, UK). Protein content was measured using Bradford
reagent and samples were analyzed using immunoblotting
as described previously. MRI was performed on a 7T

Drug measurements
Concentrations of NVP-BEZ235 in biological
samples were determined using liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Drug was extracted using
3-4 vol methanol containing 500ng/ml Olomoucin used
as internal standard. Chromatography carried out on
a Kinetics C18 column (5.0 cm × 2.1 mm ID, 2.6-μm
particle size; Phenomenex) using a 1290 LC system with a
gradient mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid/methanol at 0.6
mL/min over 10 minutes. Detection was by LC-MS using
a Agilent 6410triple quadropole in which the analyte was
ionized by electrospray interface in positive mode (gas
temperature 300 flow 12 l/min, nebulizer 40psi, capillary
voltage 4000V.The following transition were monitored
[M + H]+472.2 to 454.2 at 50V collision energy for NVPBEZ235and [M + H]+ 299.1 to 177.1 at 30V collision
energy for Olomoucin. The assay was linear in the range
of 10-5000 nM.
