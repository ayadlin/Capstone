Abstract
Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) was identified as an oncogene amplified and overexpressed
in several human cancers. Recent evidence suggested that Wip1 is a critical inhibitor in the ATM/ATR-p53
DNA damage signaling pathway. Wip1 dephosphorylates several key DNA damage–responsive proteins and
reverses DNA damage–induced cell cycle checkpoints. Previous reports showed that Wip1 was transcriptionally induced by p53 at the early stage of the DNA damage response. To investigate the temporal and functional regulation of Wip1, we identified a microRNA, miR-16, that specifically targets the mRNA of Wip1 and
thus negatively regulates the expression level of Wip1. miR-16 itself is induced immediately after DNA damage. Therefore, the increase in Wip1 protein level is significantly postponed compared with that of its mRNA
level, preventing a premature inactivation of ATM/ATR signaling and allowing a functional completion of
the early DNA damage response. To better understand miR-16 biological functions in the context of cancer
cells, we examined its expression in mammary tumor stem cells and found it to be markedly downregulated
in mammary tumor stem cells. Overexpression of miR-16 or inhibition of Wip1 suppresses the self-renewal
and growth of mouse mammary tumor stem cells and sensitizes MCF-7 human breast cancer cells to the
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Together, our results suggest an important role of miR-16 in the regulation of Wip1 phosphatase in the DNA damage response and mammary tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 70(18);

Introduction
Eukaryotic cells have evolved a multifaceted response to
counteract the potentially deleterious effects of DNA damage. On sensing DNA damage or stalled replication forks,
DNA damage checkpoints are activated to arrest cell cycle
progression and repair damaged DNA. Once DNA repair is
completed, DNA damage signaling pathways need to be inactivated when cells return to normal. The wild-type p53induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1 or PPM1D) is a member of
the type 2C serine/threonine phosphatases. Recent evidence
indicates that Wip1 is a critical regulator of DNA damage signaling pathways (1, 2).
Several Wip1 dephosphorylation targets have been identified in the ATM/ATR-p53 DNA damage signaling pathway, including ATM, Chk1, Chk2, p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase, p53, Mdm2, and MdmX (3–8). Through de-

phosphorylation of those key kinases that initiate cell cycle
checkpoints, Wip1 releases cells from cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, Wip1 negatively regulates p53 levels and activities by stabilizing Mdm2 and MdmX, and thus shuts down
p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoints. Wip1null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) displayed reduced
proliferation, enhanced p53 transcriptional activity, and enhanced DNA damage–induced checkpoints (9). The inhibitory roles of Wip1 on the DNA damage signaling and the
tumor suppressor p53 suggested that the WIP1 gene is an
oncogene. Consistent with an oncogenic function, the
WIP1 gene is present in amplified copy numbers and is
overexpressed in many human cancer types, including
breast carcinomas, ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas,
neuroblastomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, gastric carcinomas, and medulloblastomas (10–16).
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small (∼22 nucleotides) noncoding regulatory RNA molecules that are involved in diverse biological processes and various diseases. By virtue of sequence
complementarity, miRNAs bind to the mRNAs of their target
genes and then block translation or accelerate their degradation (17). Emerging evidence has shown that miRNA biogenesis is regulated on DNA damage stresses. Pothof and
colleagues (18) reported that UV damage triggered a cell
cycle–dependent relocalization of Ago2 into stress granules
and a change of miRNA expression profiling. Recent work from
the Miyazono group showed that the tumor suppressor p53
promoted the posttranscriptional processing of a subgroup

miR-16 Regulation of Wip1 Phosphatase

of miRNAs. The interaction between p53 and the Drosha complex facilitates the processing of primary miRNAs to precursor miRNAs (19). miRNAs also influence DNA damage
response by regulating the expression levels of their target
genes. Many genes involved in the DNA damage response
can be targeted by their specific miRNAs. For instance, human miR-421 was shown to target ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia
mutated) transcripts and downregulate their protein expression. Consequently, overexpression of miR-421 sensitized cells
to ionizing radiation (20). Human miR-15a and miR-16 cluster
targets cyclin D1 (CCND1), BCL2, and WNT3A, which enhances G1-S cell cycle checkpoint and inhibits tumorigenic
features such as survival, proliferation, and invasion (21).
In the present study, we show that the transcripts of the
WIP1 gene are specifically targeted by miR-16. Overexpression of miR-16 abolishes the DNA damage–responsive
Wip1 induction, whereas inhibition of miR-16 markedly accelerates and enhances the Wip1 induction. Deletion of the
miR-16–targeted sequence in the 3′-untranslated region
(UTR) of WIP1 depleted miR-16 effects on Wip1. Previous
studies reported that the 5′-UTR of the WIP1 gene includes
a conserved p53 response element, facilitating a p53dependent induction of the WIP1 transcripts. However,
the induction of Wip1 proteins seems to have a delayed
onset in contrast to an immediate induction of the WIP1
transcripts in response to DNA damage. We presented that
the level of miR-16 is rapidly induced on DNA damage
stress, which postpones the accumulation of the Wip1 protein and thus allows cells to initiate functional cell cycle
checkpoints in the early stage of DNA damage response.
Interestingly, miR-16 is downregulated in mammospheres
originated from mammary tumor stem cells. Overexpression of miR-16 in mammary tumor cells sensitizes them
to doxorubicin treatment and significantly reduces the proliferation of mammary tumor stem/progenitor cells, implicating miR-16 in the regulation of the self-renewal of
mammary tumor stem cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
U2OS (human osteosarcoma line) and MCF-7 (human
breast cancer line) cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in 2007 and maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS). Cells were cultured and stored according to the supplier's instructions and used at passages 5 to 20. Once
resuscitated, cell lines obtained from ATCC are routinely
authenticated (once every 6 months, cells were last tested
in October 2009) through cell morphology monitoring,
growth curve analysis, species verification by isoenzymology
and karyotyping, identity verification using short tandem
repeat profiling analysis, and contamination checks. Expression of p53 and Wip1 in these two cell lines was confirmed by
immunoblotting before they were used in the experiments.
Primary Wip1+/+ and Wip1−/− MEFs were harvested and cultured as previously described (9).

Plasmid constructs, cell transfection, and infection
Chemically synthesized pre-miRNAs, control miRNAs, and
antagomirs were purchased from Ambion. WIP1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector was purchased from
Open Biosystems. Using PCR primers 5′-ACTCTAGAAATGCATCTGGGAAATGAGG-3′ and 5′-TGTCTAGAGCAGGCATGATGCTCAAAG-3′, the wild-type 3′-UTR of WIP1 (1.1 kbp)
was amplified from human cDNA library and cloned into
the XbaI site of pRL vector (Promega). Mutant WIP1 3′UTR was generated based on the pRL-WIP1-3′-UTR by deleting 6 nucleotides that are recognized by miR-16. Lentiviral
miR-16 and miR-21 expression constructs were obtained
from Genecopoeia. Lentiviral packaging vectors (Genecopoeia) and miRNA expression vector were transfected into
293T cells by Fugene HD transfection reagent (Roche) following the manufacturer's manual. Two days after transfection,
cell culture supernatants were collected, filtered, and titrated
using target cells. Control or pseudovirus particles expressing
miRNAs were used to infect mouse or human cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 to ensure the complete infection of
target cells.
Isolation of mouse mammary tumor cells and
mammosphere culture
MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic mice [FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu)202
Mul/J] were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Normal
mammary tissues or mammary tumors from ErbB2 transgenic mice were mechanically dissociated and placed in a digestion medium (DMEM with 1 mmol/L glutamine, 5% FBS)
supplemented with 200 units/mL collagenase (Sigma) and
100 units/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 5 hours at 37°C. Cell
suspensions were centrifuged at 80 × g, resuspended in 0.2%
NaCl to lyse RBCs, and filtered through 20-μm mesh. Mammary tumor cells were plated onto ultralow attachment
plates (Corning) at a density of 20,000 viable cells/mL (to obtain primary mammospheres) in a serum-free DMEM-F12
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 μg/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor and 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast
growth factor (Sigma), and 0.4% bovine serum albumin
(Sigma; ref. 22). Mammospheres were harvested after 10 days
for the analysis of gene and miRNA expression. For the
differentiation culture of mammospheres, collected mammospheres were treated with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and
mechanically dissociated by pippetting, and then cultured
in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) without growth factors. Differentiated cells were harvested for miRNA analysis after 3 days.
Western blot analysis, antibodies, and
purified proteins
Immunoprecipitations, Western blot analysis, and immunoprecipitation–Western blot analyses were performed by
standard methods described previously (4). Anti-actin, antip53, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-goat IgG, HRP antirabbit IgG, and HRP anti-mouse IgG were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Wip1 was purchased from
Abgent; and anti–Bcl-2 and anti–caspase-3 were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology.

Treatments with DNA-damaging agents or
Wip1 inhibitor
Cells were treated with 500 ng/mL neocarzinostatin (NCS;
Sigma-Aldrich) and harvested at the indicated time points
after treatment for the analyses of mRNA and proteins. In
cell viability assays, MCF-7 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1,000 per well in flat-bottom 96-well microplates.
After 24 hours, the cells were cultivated with doxorubicin at
the indicated concentration for 72 hours. At the end of incubation, the viability of cells was determined using the CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. In mammosphere culture, mouse mammary tumor cells were treated
with the specific Wip1 inhibitor CCT007093 (5 μmol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich) or DMSO (mock treatment) as indicated.
Analysis of miRNAs by Northern blotting
Total RNA was extracted by Trizol reagents (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer's instructions. An equal volume
of 4 mol/L LiCl and 10 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.0) was added
to the RNA solution and incubated overnight at 4°C. High–
molecular weight RNA was recovered by centrifugation at
12,000 × g for 15 minutes. The supernatant, containing
DNA and low–molecular weight RNAs, was made 10% in
polyethylene glycol 8000 and 0.5 mol/L NaCl and incubated
for 30 minutes on ice to precipitate the DNA. After centrifugation to remove DNA, low–molecular weight RNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. RNA gel blot analysis of
low–molecular weight RNA was performed exactly as described using Ambion ULTRAhyb hybridization solution at
45°C. DNA probes used were as follows: U6 RNA probe, 5′ATATGGAACGCTTCACGAATT-3′; miR-16 probe, 5′CGCCAATATTTACGTGCTGCTA-3′.
Primers for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Primers for genes examined in the studies were as follows:
human WIP1, 5′-TTATACCTGAACCTGACTGAC-3′ and
5′-GATCTTTTGAGGGTATGACTA-3′; mouse Wip1, 5′TTGCCTCACACACCATTTGT-3′ and 5′-GGGTGTTAGCAGCACCATTT-3′; Oct-4, 5′-GTGGAGGAAGCCGACAACAATG-3′
and 5′-GCCTCATACTCTTCTCG-3′; KLF4, 5′-AGAGGAGCCCAAGCCAAAGAGG-3′ and 5′-CCACAGCCGTCCCAGTCACAGT-3′; Keratin-14, 5′-GCTGAGGAATGGTTCTTCAG-3′
and 5′-CAGGTTATTCTCCAGGGATG-3′; Keratin-18,
5′-AGATCGACAATGCCCGCCTT-3′ and 5′CTTGCTGAGGTCCTGAGATT-3′. Primers for miRNA quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were obtained
from Exiqon: U6 RNA control, miR-16, and miR-21.

Results
miR-16 inhibits Wip1 expression by targeting
3′-UTR of Wip1
Previous studies showed that the WIP1 gene is transcriptionally induced by the tumor suppressor p53, but it remains
unclear if posttranscriptional regulation affects the expression of Wip1 protein. To explore the possibility that miRNAs
might regulate WIP1 expression, we searched the 3′-UTR of

7178

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

the human WIP1 gene for miRNA-targeting motifs using the
TargetScan 5.1, from which three miRNAs were predicted to
bind to the 3′-UTR of WIP1, including miR-16, miR-217, and
miR-153. Twelve nucleotides from miR-16 are complementary to the target sequence in the 3′-UTR of WIP1 (Fig. 1A). To
test the in silico prediction, we first examined the endogenous Wip1 protein level by immunoblotting after transient
transfection of a control and the precursors of the three predicted miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into human U2OS cells. As
shown in Fig. 1B, the WIP1 protein level was significantly decreased by ectopic miR-16 expression, whereas the other two
predicted miRNAs, miR-217 and miR-153, had only minor effects. miRNAs that were randomly picked as negative controls, miR-145 and miR-203, had minimal or no effect on
the Wip1 level. We next examined the levels of Wip1 in cells
transfected with pre-miR-16 or specific inhibitory oligonucleotide against miR-16, antigomir-16, during 0 to 4 hours after
the treatment of a radiomimetic drug, NCS. Ectopic miR-16
had a pronounced suppression against the induction of Wip1
proteins, whereas antagomir-16 promoted the expression of
WIP1 (Fig. 1C).
To further validate Wip1 as a bona fide target of miR-16,
we cloned the WIP1 3′-UTR portion containing the miR-16
target site into a Renilla luciferase reporter construct and
performed a luciferase reporter assay following cotransfection of reporter constructs with precursor miR-16 into
U2OS cells. A significant reduction (∼75%) in the luciferase
activity was observed for the reporter construct containing
the WIP1 3′-UTR in the presence of pre-miR-16, but not
in the presence of control or the other four pre-miRNAs
(Fig. 1D, left). Transfection of antagomir-16 increased the
luciferase activity by ∼50% for the WIP1 3′-UTR reporter
construct. Deletion of six nucleotides of seed sequence almost completely abolished the effects of pre-miR-16 and
antagomir-16 on the luciferase transcripts with the WIP1
3′-UTR, suggesting that the WIP1 gene is an authentic target of miR-16 in vivo (Fig. 1D, right).
miR-16 regulates Wip1 induction in the
DNA damage response
Accumulating evidence supports a role of Wip1 as a critical
negative regulator of DNA damage signaling pathways. Wip1
itself is also responsive to DNA damage. The Appella group
reported that Wip1 levels were transcriptionally induced in
a p53-dependent manner on DNA damage (23, 24). To explore
the temporal regulation of Wip1 during DNA damage response, we measured the Wip1 mRNA and protein levels in
U2OS cells at 0 to 8 hours after NCS treatment. Consistent
with the results from the Appella group, we observed that
the Wip1 mRNA level was rapidly increased in response to
NCS, reaching the peak level within 2 hours. However, the
Wip1 protein level was induced at a slower pace, which
reached a peak at 6 hours after treatment (Fig. 2A and B).
We further explored whether there was posttranscriptional
inhibition of WIP1 expression. By Northern blotting analysis,
the level of mature miR-16 increased shortly after NCS treatment and hit its peak around 2 to 4 hours after treatment
when the Wip1 protein levels still remained at a relatively

miR-16 Regulation of Wip1 Phosphatase

and normalized with the control (Ctrl) sample (bottom). C, immunoblots of endogenous Wip1 in U2OS cells transfected with control miRNA, miR-16, or

containing wild-type WIP1 3′-UTR (left) or mutant WIP1 3′-UTR (right) was transfected into U2OS cells with the indicated miRNAs or antagomirs. Renilla
luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection and normalized to firefly luciferase. Relative luciferase activity (luminescence) was obtained after

low level (Fig. 2C). To exclude the possibility that the effects of
miR-16 are limited to cellular response to NCS, we performed
the same experiments in U2OS cells treated with 10 Gy of ionizing radiation. The similar phenomena were observed on the
induction of miR-16, Wip1 mRNA, and protein at the early
stage of DNA damage response (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and B). To further determine if altered levels of miR-16
change the temporal pattern of Wip1 induction, we examined
Wip1 protein levels in the presence of ectopic pre-miR-16 or
antagomir-16 over a 12-hour time course. Transfection of premiR-16 significantly suppressed the induction of Wip1
throughout the whole time course. Inhibiting miR-16 by antagomir boosted Wip1 expression as early as 2 hours after

NCS treatment and maintained a stable high level of Wip1
up to 6 hours (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that miR-16 is
an important regulator for Wip1 induction in the early stage
of DNA damage response.
miR-16 regulates cell proliferation and sensitizes
MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin
To assess whether miR-16 modulates cell proliferation, we
examined the cell growth of the littermate Wip1+/+ and Wip1−/−
MEFs isolated from midgestation. Consistent with a previous report (9), Wip1 −/− MEFs exhibited a much slower
growth in contrast to their Wip1+/+ counterparts. Growth
curve analyses of Wip1+/+ and Wip1−/− MEFs showed that

the proliferation rates of early-passage Wip1−/− MEFs were
substantially retarded compared with Wip1 +/+ MEFs
(Fig. 3A). Four days after plating, Wip1−/− MEFs almost
stopped proliferation, whereas Wip1+/+ MEFs were still in
the doubling stage. Lentivirus particles expressing the precursor of mmu-miR-16 (mouse miR-16) were transduced into
both Wip1+/+ and Wip1−/− MEFs, and the growth curves of
these fibroblasts were analyzed. Ectopic overexpression of

miR-16 dramatically inhibited the cell proliferation of Wip1+/+
MEFs to a level similar to that of Wip1−/− MEFs. Moreover, the
absence of Wip1 largely diminished the effects of miR-16 on
cell proliferation. No significant effects were observed on the
growth of Wip1−/− MEFs in the presence or absence of the lentiviral miR-16, suggesting that Wip1 may be one of the major
miR-16 targets in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and
cell proliferation.

Figure 2. miR-16 inhibits the DNA damage–mediated induction of Wip1. A, Wip1 protein is induced in response to DNA damage. U2OS cells were

to DNA damage. U2OS cells were treated with 500 ng/mL NCS, and total RNAs (tRNA) were harvested at indicated time points. miR-16 levels were
determined by Northern blots (left) and quantitative RT-PCR (from three sets of samples; right). D, miR-16 counteracts the induction of Wip1 in the
DNA damage response. U2OS cells were transfected with control miRNA, miR-16, or antagomir-16. Left, 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with

control or miR-16–expressing pseudoviruses. B, miR-16 inhibits the expression of Wip1 in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were transfected with control or

transfection, cells were incubated with increasing doses of doxorubicin as indicated. Cell viability was determined 3 d after incubation.

WIP1 gene amplification occurs in many cancer types, including 11% to 18% of primary human breast cancer samples,
nearly all of which express wild-type p53 (10, 25–29). This observation has led to the hypotheses that aberrantly high levels of Wip1 are a causative factor in tumorigenesis.
Inhibiting Wip1 by small interfering RNA or the specific inhibitor CCT007093 reduced the cell viability selectively on
cells with WIP1 amplification. Furthermore, loss of Wip1 sensitized cells to stress- or DNA damage–induced apoptosis. To
determine if miR-16 increases sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic drugs that cause DNA damage, we examined
the viability of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in which
the WIP1 gene is substantially amplified and overexpressed.
We delivered miR-16 to MCF-7 cells by lentiviral infection.
Lentiviral expression of miR-16 increased the level of total
miR-16 by 7-fold in MCF-7 cells, whereas the level of the control miRNA, miR-21, was unchanged (Fig. 3B). miR-16 overexpression dramatically promoted apoptosis, indicated by a

higher level of cleaved caspase-3 in cells expressing lentiviral
miR-16, compared with the control cells. Reduced Wip1 levels led to higher levels of DNA damage–induced phosphorylation of ATM (Ser1981) and Chk2 (Thr68) that are two of the
identified Wip1 dephosphorylation substrates (3, 5). As expected, ectopic miR-16 knocked down the expression of
Bcl-2, another known target of miR-16 (Fig. 3B; ref. 30). To
examine whether miR-16 modulates the chemosensitivity of
MCF-7 cells in a Wip1-dependent manner, we treated MCF-7
cells with increasing doses of doxorubicin. Cell survival was
assessed by measuring the proliferation of viable cells. As
shown in Fig. 3C, MCF-7 cells overexpressing miR-16 displayed a significantly higher sensitivity to doxorubicin compared with the control MCF-7 cells (IC 50 : 0.037 versus
0.13 μmol/L). Knockdown of Wip1 by chemically synthesized
small interfering RNA had no additional effect on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells overexpressing miR-16 (IC50: 0.037 versus 0.032 μmol/L; Fig. 3C). Our results indicated that miR-16

miR-16 is downregulated in mammary tumor
stem/progenitor cells
The WIP1 gene is frequently amplified in human breast
cancers that contain wild-type p53. Deletion of Wip1 in mice
bearing mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoterdriven oncogenes Erbb2 or Hras1 impaired mammary carcinogenesis (26). However, no spontaneous mammary tumor
formation was observed in MMTV-Wip1 transgenic mice
(31). This suggested that overexpression of Wip1 phosphatase alone is not sufficient to cause breast cancer in mice.
Nevertheless, Wip1 can complement in vitro other oncogenes, such as Ras and ErbB2, in their ability to transform
mouse embryo fibroblasts (26). We hypothesized that upregulation of Wip1 probably provides a selective advantage for
the clonal expansion of cancer cells. It is now becoming clear
that a subgroup of cells in mammary tumors possesses
tumor-initiating cell function and contributes to tumor expansion and growth (32–35). The tumor-initiating cells, or
cancer stem cells, can be isolated using cell surface markers
or can be enriched in nonadherent mammospheres.
Dontu and colleagues developed a culture system in which
cells derived from reduction mammoplasties were seeded in
nonadherent nondifferentiating culture conditions. Cells capable of surviving and proliferating in such conditions
formed discrete clusters of cells termed mammospheres
(34). Such spheroids were enriched in progenitor cells capable of differentiating along multiple lineages. To determine if
Wip1 plays a role in the proliferation of mammary tumor
stem cells, we isolated primary tumor cells from the mammary tumors in MMTV-Erbb2 transgenic mice. Amplification
of the Wip1 gene was not observed in any of the three studied
MMTV-Erbb2 mammary tumors. Levels of Wip1 protein and
mRNA in two tumor samples were slightly increased over
those in the corresponding normal tissues, whereas the level
of miR-16 was 10% to 30% lower in tumor samples than in
normal tissues (Fig. 4A). The whole population of primary
tumor cells was cultured in regular cell culture medium or
in mammosphere culture medium. As shown in Fig. 4B,
∼2.5% of total cells formed mammospheres containing
∼300 cells after 12 days of cultivation in nonadherent dishes.
In contrast to the whole-cell population, stem cell markers
(Oct-4 and KLF4 genes) were highly expressed exclusively in
mammosphere cells, whereas differentiation markers (Keratin14 and Keratin-18 expressions) were suppressed, which
are typical characteristics of tumor stem cells. Quantitated
by real-time PCR, the levels of miR-16 were observed to have
a marked reduction of 70% to 80% in all mammospheres tested in our experiments compared with that of the whole population of tumor cells. Accordingly, the Wip1 protein levels
increased by 3- to 5-fold in mammospheres (Fig. 4C). We isolated three mammospheres under the microscope and then
cultured them in the regular culture medium. The progenitor
cells in the mammospheres redifferentiated and proliferated.
Levels of miR-16 in these recovered cancer cells from each
mammospheres were similar to the original cancer cells

(Fig. 4D). The results suggested that Wip1 may be differentially expressed in normal cancer cells and cancer stem cells,
and implicated that Wip1 is likely involved in the maintenance and proliferation of mammary tumor stem/progenitor
cells.
To further determine the roles of Wip1 in mammary tumor
stem cells, we inhibited the activity of Wip1 by its specific inhibitor CCT007093 (36), lentiviral shRNA, or ectopically overexpressed lentiviral miR-16 in mouse mammary tumor cells.
In each sample, we counted the number of mammospheres
that were larger than 50 μm in size. Mammosphere-forming
ability of tumor cells was sharply reduced when Wip1 was inhibited or silenced (Fig. 5A). As much as 2.54% of tumor cells
in the control sample formed mammospheres with an average size of 215 μm. Inhibiting Wip1 by CCT007093, shRNA, or
miR-16 decreased the numbers of mammospheres to 0.17%,
0.58%, and 0.26% of total cells, respectively, and the mammospheres were significantly smaller with the size of 80 to
105 μm. As a negative control, overexpression of miR-21
had no noticeable effects on the size and number of mammospheres. Restoration of Wip1 in the miR-16 overexpressed
cells remarkably reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-16 on
blocking mammosphere formation in culture, suggesting that
Wip1 is a primary target of miR-16 in the regulation of mammary tumor stem cells (Fig. 5B and C).

Discussion
The WIP1 gene was recently identified as an oncogene that
is aberrantly regulated in several human cancers (10–16). In
particular, the WIP1 gene at 17q23 is amplified and overexpressed in 18% of human aggressive primary breast tumors
that exclusively express wild-type p53 (29). Wip1 removal significantly inhibited mammary tumorigenesis induced by other breast cancer oncogenes, such as Hras1 or Erbb2 (26).
Recent studies from our laboratory and other groups have
revealed the mechanisms for the oncogenicity of Wip1.
Wip1 is a master inhibitor in the initiation and maintenance
of DNA damage signaling and repair pathways through dephosphorylating H2AX, ATM, Chk1, Chk2, and UNG2 (4, 5,
36–39). Due to its wide-spectrum functioning in the control
of DNA damage responses, Wip1 stands out from other DNA
damage–responsive proteins as a very attractive target for
potential breast cancer therapeutics.
On DNA damage stress, Wip1 is transcriptionally induced
in p53-procificent cells but not in p53-null cells (23). Recent
studies identified WIP1 as a p53- and CREB-regulated gene. A
cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and a p53 response element are located in the 5′-UTR of the WIP1 gene. CREB binding to the CRE contributes to the regulation of basal
expression of Wip1 and directs transcription initiation at upstream sites, whereas the p53 response element is required
for the p53-dependent induction of transcription (24, 40).
Our results showed that the level of Wip1 transcripts was immediately induced at the very early stage of the DNA damage
response, but Wip1 protein levels increased at a much slower
pace. The delayed onset for Wip1 protein induction allows

miR-16 Regulation of Wip1 Phosphatase

Figure 4. miR-16 is downregulated in mammary tumor stem cells. A, levels of Wip1 and miR-16 in mouse mammary tumors are not significantly different
from those of normal mammary tissues. N1 to N3, normal mammary gland tissues; T1 to T3, mammary tumors. Levels of Wip1 mRNA and miR-16 were
determined by quantitative RT-PCR. B, micrographs of mammospheres originated from mammary tumor stem cells. TC-1 and TC-2, mammary tumor cells;
MS-1 and MS-2, mammospheres from the corresponding mammary tumor cells. C, expression levels of stem cell markers and differentiation markers in
mammospheres and their original tumors. Stem cell markers (Oct-4 and KLF4), differentiation markers (Keratin-14 and Keratin-18), miR-16, and β-actin
(as control) were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR in starting tumor cells and mammospheres. NC, normal tissue cells. D, miR-16 is upregulated in
cells differentiated from mammospheres. Top, Wip1 protein levels were increased in mammospheres but downregulated when mammospheres were
differentiated to nonstem cells. Rec, recovered cells. In contrast, miR-16 was downregulated in each of the individual mammospheres but upregulated in
redifferentiated cells. Bottom, levels of miR-16 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR.

Figure 5. miR-16 inhibits the maintenance and proliferation of mammary tumor stem cells. A, miR-16 and the Wip1 inhibitor reduce the number of mammary
tumor stem cells. Cells isolated from mammary tumors in transgenic MMTV-Erbb2 mice were infected by control viruses or pseudoviruses expressing
miR-21, miR-16, and/or mouse Wip1 and cultured in the mammosphere-forming medium with or without 5 μmol/L of the Wip1 inhibitor CCT007093.
Ten days after incubation, mammospheres were observed and their sizes and numbers were determined. B, mammosphere formation is inhibited by
miR-16, the Wip1 inhibitor, or Wip1 shRNA, and restoration of Wip1 reversed the effects of miR-16 on blocking mammosphere formation in culture.
Mammosphere numbers (left) and sizes (right) were measured under each condition.

cells to activate a DNA damage–triggered signaling transduction cascade without early inhibition by Wip1.
miR-16 seems to be a major regulatory factor in suppressing Wip1 protein expression. The level of miR-16 rapidly increased after DNA damage and then slowly returned to
normal. Altered levels of miR-16 led to dramatically different
patterns of Wip1 induction. Inhibition of miR-16 resulted in
greater abundance and accelerated induction of Wip1 proteins, whereas overexpression of miR-16 almost abolished
the DNA damage–mediated induction of Wip1. Our studies
provide strong evidence that miR-16 is a critical regulator for
the induction of Wip1 phosphatase in the stress response
pathway. Given the important role of Wip1 in mammary tumorigenesis, we further showed a lower abundance of miR16 in mammospheres that initiated from mammary tumor
stem/progenitor cells. Accordingly, Wip1 levels were markedly upregulated in spheroid cells. Inhibiting Wip1 or overexpressing miR-16 dramatically reduced the number and size
of mammospheres, but no cumulative effects from these two

treatments were achieved in our assays. This observation implicates that miR-16 may regulate the proliferation and differentiation of mammary tumor stem cells at least partly
through inhibiting Wip1. Two recent publications suggest
that loss of p53 permits expansion of presumptive cancer
stem cells in mouse mammary tumors and in human breast
cell lines. These results add restriction of cancer stem cells
as a new tumor suppressor activity attributed to p53 (41, 42).
Given the important roles of Wip1 in the regulation of p53
signaling, it is likely that Wip1 promotes mammary tumor
stem cells through p53. The most interesting part of the
miR-16–Wip1 regulatory loop is that miR-16 is responsive
to DNA damage. A recent study from the Miyazono group
showed that p53 enhances the posttranscriptional maturation of several miRNAs with growth-suppressive function,
including miR-16. We showed here that miR-16 was induced in the DNA damage response. Putting together,
miR-16 is a novel player in the ATM-p53-Wip1 autoregulatory feedback loop.
