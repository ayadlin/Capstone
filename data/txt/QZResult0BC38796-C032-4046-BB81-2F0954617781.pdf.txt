BACKGROUND: Compared with imatinib, nilotinib is a potent breakpoint cluster region/v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene
(bcr-abl) kinase inhibitor, and it induces higher rate and rapid complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), yet no clinical data are available
regarding its efficacy against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem cells. Earlier studies demonstrated that clusters of differentiation 34–
positive, Philadelphia chromosome–positive (CD34þPhþ) cells are detectable in about 45% of patients with CML, despite being on longterm imatinib therapy and having achieved sustained CCyR. METHODS: CD34þ cells from bone marrow of de novo CML patients in the
chronic phase (n ¼ 24) treated with nilotinib (median duration of therapy, 22 months) were isolated and scored for BCR-ABL by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Similar analysis was also performed in 5 de novo CML chronic phase patients who achieved
CCyR within 3 months of nilotinib therapy. RESULTS: FISH evaluation of a median of 100 CD34þ nuclei per patient revealed that only 1
of 20 (5%) evaluable patients showed residual Phþ progenitor cells. In this patient, just 1 of 140 (0.7%) CD34þ interphase nuclei was
found to be positive for BCR-ABL. Surprisingly, no CD34þPhþ cells were found even in those 5 patients evaluated after 3 months of
nilotinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed for the first time the persistence of CD34þPhþ cells during nilotinib first-line
treatment. Preliminary results showed that in patients in CCyR, even after short-term nilotinib therapy, residual leukemic progenitors
are very rarely detected compared with imatinib-treated CCyR patients. It is yet to be determined if these findings will have an

Imatinib mesylate is highly effective in reducing leukemic cell burden in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), inducing
rapid hematologic and cytogenetic responses in the vast majority of patients. Although its efficacy has been widely confirmed, it has also been demonstrated that discontinuation of treatment is associated with molecular relapse in about 60%
of patients, even if they had previously achieved a sustained complete molecular response (CMolR).1 The cause of CML
reappearance could reside in the persistence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant leukemic stem cells, representing a
‘‘quiescent’’ reservoir of the disease. In this regard, it has been reported that BCR-ABL–positive progenitor cells (identified
as clusters of differentiation 34–positive, Philadelphia chromosome–positive [CD34þPhþ] cells) can still be detected in
patients with complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) not only after short-term imatinib treatment2 but also after a stable,
long-lasting CCyR.3 In fact, we had previously performed a study in which we evaluated the presence of residual bone
marrow (BM) CD34þPhþ cells in 31 CML patients in CCyR for a median time of 35 months during imatinib treatment.
The study demonstrated that 45% of patients, the majority of whom were also in major molecular response (MMolR),
still harbored a median of 1% (range, 1%-7%) of CD34þPhþ CML cells in BM.3 Nilotinib, a second-generation TKI,
has a greater potency and selectivity for BCR-ABL than does imatinib4 and was first approved for patients with CML in
the chronic or accelerated phase who were resistant to or could not tolerate imatinib.5 Furthermore, a recent prospective
study comparing nilotinib with imatinib as first-line treatment in patients with CML has confirmed considerable efficacy

both in terms of CCyR and MMolR.6 Nilotinib appears
to eradicate more rapidly the bulk of CML cells, at both
dosages of 300 mg bid (twice daily) and 400 mg bid,
inducing in early chronic phase patients a higher rate of
CCyR at 6 months of treatment compared to imatinib
(67% and 63% vs 45%, respectively).7 This superior efficacy has so far also been confirmed at 24 months of treatment with a CCyR rate of 87% and 85% versus 77% and
a MMolR rate of 71% and 67% versus 44%, respectively.8 Despite these very promising results, to date, it is
unknown if nilotinib would be more effective in eradicating CML CD34þ cells, hence, representing potential
‘‘curative’’ treatment for CML patients. On this matter, in
vitro data showed that nilotinib, as well as imatinib, is
unable to eliminate CML progenitors.9,10 However, no
reports have been published so far about the evaluation of
persisting Phþ progenitor cells in CML patients during
first-line nilotinib treatment. Therefore, in order to compare the efficacy of this second-line TKI in eliminating
CML precursors in comparison with imatinib, we investigated whether BM CD34þPhþ progenitors could be still
detected in a cohort of CML patients in CCyR following
first-line nilotinib therapy.

turer instructions (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, Calif) and
as previously published.3 Briefly, BMMCs were resuspended in buffer (phosphate-buffered saline; 0.5% fetal
bovine serum; 2 mM ethylamine diamine tetraacetic acid)
to obtain a concentration of 108 total cells/300 lL. Subsequently, 100 lL CD34 microbeads per 108 total cells and
100 lL/108 total cells of Fc receptor blocker were added
to the cell suspension. After incubation for 30 minutes at
4 C, cell suspension was washed with buffer and applied
to the immunomagnetic column at a concentration
of approximately 108 total cells/500 lL. In order to
achieve a highly purified CD34þ population, 2 rounds of
magnetic separation were performed.
Flow Cytometry Analysis of CD341 Cells

To determine the yield and the purity of sorted CD34þ
cells, aliquots of whole BM were evaluated for CD34þ
cells by flow cytometry. Similarly, aliquots of cells were
analyzed after column separation. Flow cytometry analysis
was performed by incubating each cell sample with antiCD34, anti-CD38, and anti-CD45 fluorescent antibodies and subsequently by analyzing the samples on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

The endpoint of the study was to evaluate the percentage
of BM residual CD34þPhþ cells in CML patients
in CCyR during first-line nilotinib treatment. The
patients studied were included in 2 clinical trials
(GIMEMA CML0307 study, ClinicalTrials.gov number
NCT00481052, and CAMN107A2303 study, ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00471497), and the evaluation
of residual leukemic stem cells was performed during a
routine BM aspirate after receiving a specific patient
informed consent. As in our previous CD34þPhþ study
during imatinib treatment,3 about 10 mL of BM per
patient was collected in heparin-anticoagulated tubes. A
small amount of sample was not further manipulated and
was evaluated for standard fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and flow cytometry study. The rest
of the sample was used for CD34þ isolation and subsequent FISH analysis of CD34þ-purified cells.
Magnetic Labeling and Separation
of CD341 Progenitors

Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were isolated
by density gradient separation, and CD34þ cells were
selected from BMMCs using immunomagnetic column
separation according to published methods and manufac5266

FISH Analysis of Whole BM Cells and
Purified CD341 Cells

FISH was performed on fixed cells according to conventional published methods and manufacturer specifications. Briefly, slides were denatured in 70% formamide/
2 standard sodium citrate (SSC) for 3 minutes at 75 C
and deydrated in ethanol solutions. About 10 lL of
probes were hybridized on interphase cells overnight at
42 C, and washes were performed in 2 SSC and
Tween/2 SSC, counterstained with 40 ,60 -diamidine-2phenylindole (DAPI). LSI BCR/ABL dual-color extra signal (ES), single fusion translocation was used as probe
(Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill). Slides were analyzed with a
Nikon 2 fluorescence microscope and images captured
with a charge-coupled device camera using an image analysis system (Genikon). When conventional whole BM
analysis was performed, at least 200 interphase cells were
analyzed. In the case of CD34þ-purified cells, 100 interphase nuclei was considered an adequate number for
FISH analysis. Two observers independently scored only
isolated cells in order to avoid possible false positive
results (overlapping nuclei). In our experience, the LSI
BCR/ABL ES probe has a false positive signal rate close
to 0, and FISH negativity was defined as the complete
absence of BCR-ABL fusion signal.

RESULTS
Patient Population

Twenty-four patients were evaluated for residual
CD34þPhþ leukemic cells. The median age at CML diagnosis was 47 years (range, 29-80 years) with 18 males and
6 females. At the time of residual CD34þPhþ evaluation,
the median time of nilotinib treatment was 22 months
(range, 9-30 months) with 17 patients (71%) receiving
nilotinib 400 mg bid, 5 patients (21%) receiving 300 mg
bid, whereas 2 patients (8%) were on 400 mg daily due to
intolerance. All patients had been in CCyR for a median
time of 17.5 months (range, 6-27 months); 20 of 24
patients (83%) had been in MMolR (ie, BCR-ABL/ABLIS
ratio < 0.1%)11,12 for a median time of 12 months
(range, 1-27 months); 1 of 24 (4%) had been in CMolR
(ie, BCR-ABL/ABLIS ratio < 0.01%)11,12 for 12 months,
whereas 3 of 24 (13%) had not yet achieved a MMolR.

(range, 8-14 mL). Total median cellularity was 20  106/
mL (range, 5  106 to 42  106/mL), and the median
percentage of CD34þ as measured by flow-cytometry was
0.64% (range, 0.03%-1.36%) of total BM cells. After
immunomagnetic column separation, a median number
of 4.5  105 (range, 0.9  105 to 1.5  106) of CD34þ
cells was collected, thus resulting in a yield of about 50%
of the expected number. Purity of CD34þ enriched population resulted in a median value of 89% (range, 43%89%). Regarding CD38 antigen expression, a median of
86% (range, 23%-97%) were CD34þCD38high cells,
whereas a median of 14% were CD34þCD38low.
FISH Analysis of Whole BM and CD341
Selected Population

Standard FISH analysis was performed in all 24 patients
on at least 200 nuclei of whole BM cells, and no Phþ cells
were identified. When we examined the CD34þ selected
population, in 15 of 24 (63%) patients, FISH analysis was
performed on a median of 100 nuclei (range, 100-300
nuclei), whereas in 5 of 24 (21%) patients, the median
number of nuclei analyzed was 75 (range, 60-86 nuclei).
In 4 of 24 (16%) patients, FISH analysis was not

performed due to the scarce yield of BM purified CD34þ
cells, and consequently, the inadequate number of evaluable nuclei (less than 50).
We found residual CD34þPhþ cells only in 1 of 20
(5%) evaluated patients. Of note, in this patient, a total of
140 CD34þ interphase nuclei were analyzed and only 1
of them was found to be BCR-ABL–positive (0.7%).
Early CD341Ph1 Evaluation During
Nilotinib Treatment

In 5 additional patients, we were able to evaluate
CD34þPhþ cells after only 3 months of first-line nilotinib
therapy. All 5 patients (3 males, 2 females; median age, 59
years; range, 43-67 years) were in the chronic phase at diagnosis and were enrolled in the CAMN107EIC01 study
(EUDRACT code 2009-017775-19) receiving nilotinib
300 mg bid. Conventional cytogenetic analyses were performed after 3 months of nilotinib treatment, and all 5
patients had achieved CCyR. At the same time, FISH
analysis on purified (median purity, 87%; range, 82%87%) CD34þ cells was performed, and after a median of
100 nuclei were evaluated (range, 100-200 nuclei), none
of the 5 patients showed residual CD34þPhþ cells.
Patient Follow-Up

A total of 23 of 24 patients continued nilotinib and were
monitored on a routine basis for cytogenetic and molecular residual disease, whereas 1 patient switched to imatinib
due to nonhematological toxicity. After a median time of
observation of 10 months (range, 6-16 months) from
CD34þPhþ cell evaluation, all 23 nilotinib-treated
patients were still in CCyR. Regarding molecular
response, only 3 of 23 (13%) patients did not achieve a
MMolR, 11 of 23 patients (48%) were in MMolR with a
median value of BCR-ABL/ABL ratio of 0.02% (range,
0.01%-0.05%), and 9 of 23 (39%) patients were in
CMolR. The only patient in which CD34þPhþ progenitor cells were still detectable was in MMolR for 21 months
at the time of CD34þ evaluation and was in CMolR at
the last follow-up.
DISCUSSION
The introduction of the second-generation TKI nilotinib
in the therapeutic setting of CML may change the future
goal of disease treatment. In fact when compared to imatinib, first-line nilotinib treatment has shown a higher and
earlier rate of MMolR and CMolR.6,7 On the basis of
these data, the next task could potentially be treatment
discontinuation in ‘‘optimal responders’’ without their
experiencing, as happens with imatinib, at least a 60%
probability of molecular recurrence.1 In this regard, dur5268

ing imatinib treatment, persistence of residual
CD34þPhþ progenitor cells has been documented in
vivo, even in patients with prolonged CCyR and
MMolR.2,3,13 Because nilotinib appeared not to be superior to imatinib in inducing growth inhibition of CML
progenitor cells in vitro,9 it could also be incapable of
eradicating leukemic stem cells in vivo. However, no data
are available thus far on the persistence of Phþ progenitor
cells during nilotinib treatment in patients with CML.
To explore this issue, we checked the presence of residual CD34þPhþ cells in a series of patients treated with
nilotinib since diagnosis and in stable CCyR. Surprisingly, only 1 of 20 (5%) evaluable patients showed persistence of residual Phþ progenitor cells at a negligible level,
because just 1 of 140 (0.7%) CD34þ interphase nuclei
analyzed by FISH was found to be BCR-ABL–positive.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that the efficacy of
nilotinib in reducing leukemic CD34þ cell burden has
been evaluated in vivo. The results obtained in first-line
nilotinib-treated patients are quite different from those
we found previously in a fairly comparable series of CML
patients in long-lasting CCyR during imatinib treatment.
In fact, in the earlier study, about 45% of patients in
CCyR for a median of 35 months still harbored a median
of 1% of CD34þPhþ cells.3 The difference we found in
this study (1 of 20 patients with persisting CD34þPhþ in
the nilotinib-treated group vs 14 of 31 imatinib-treated
patients) is significant, and it is even more remarkable
considering that the median treatment length at the
time of CML stem cell evaluation was much longer in
the cohort of imatinib-treated patients compared with
the nilotinib-treated cohort (39 vs 22 months). We do
not necessarily imply that nilotinib fully eradicates
CD34þPhþ cells: our data may suggest that enhanced
BCR-ABL kinase inhibition displayed by nilotinib
induces a ‘‘deeper’’ suppression of CML progenitors
and that it may be necessary to analyze a much greater
number of CD34þ nuclei in order to reach a level of
detectability.
For this purpose, it must be noted that the great majority of patients still presented residual disease at the molecular level. This may be explained by the persistence,
however ‘‘undetectable,’’ of CD34þPhþ cells and/or by
the presence of more differentiated cells as the source of
molecular disease. However, after a median of 10 additional months of treatment after CD34þPhþ evaluation
(ie, a median of 32 months of nilotinib therapy from diagnosis), only 13% of patients did not achieve MMolR,
56% of them were in stable MMolR, and 39% of them
achieved CMolR.

CD34þPhþ Cells During Nilotinib Therapy/Defina et al

In an additional 5 patients, we were able to evaluate
CD34þPhþ kinetics of reduction, because they were studied after only 3 months of nilotinib treatment. Surprisingly,
together with achieving CCyR, all 5 patients already
showed no detectable CD34þPhþ cells. Despite the very
limited number of patients studied, this may suggest that
the fast inhibitory activity displayed by nilotinib on the
bulk of CML affects stem cells as well. In conclusion,
according to these preliminary results, the great majority of
patients with CML who achieve CCyR with first-line nilotinb treatment do not show, unlike with imatinib-treated
patients in CCyR, persistence of CD34þPhþ cells. Even if
these data appear in line with the overall better clinical
results observed with nilotinib, their significance in the path
to a cure for CML has yet to be determined. In fact, additional data and a longer follow-up are required to clarify if
nilotinib is truly more efficient than imatinib in eliminating
CML quiescent stem cells in vivo and if this will translate to
a significantly higher number of nilotinib-treated patients
who achieve CMolR and are able to discontinue the treatment without disease recurrence.
