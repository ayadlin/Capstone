ABSTRACT
Although targeted therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, overcoming
acquired resistance remains a major clinical challenge. EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i),
EPZ-6438 and GSK126, are currently in the early stages of clinical evaluation and the
first encouraging signs of efficacy have recently emerged in the clinic. To anticipate
mechanisms of resistance to EZH2i, we used a forward genetic platform combining
a mutagenesis screen with next generation sequencing technology and identified
a hotspot of secondary mutations in the EZH2 D1 domain (Y111 and I109). Y111D
mutation within the WT or A677G EZH2 allele conferred robust resistance to both EPZ6438 and GSK126, but it only drove a partial resistance within the Y641F allele. EZH2
mutants required histone methyltransferase (HMT) catalytic activity and the polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components, SUZ12 and EED, to drive drug resistance.
Furthermore, D1 domain mutations not only blocked the ability of EZH2i to bind to
WT and A677G mutant, but also abrogated drug binding to the Y641F mutant. These
data provide the first cellular validation of the mechanistic model underpinning the
oncogenic function of WT and mutant EZH2. Importantly, our findings suggest that
acquired-resistance to EZH2i may arise in WT and mutant EZH2 patients through a
single mutation that remains targetable by second generation EZH2i.

SET domain mutations drive H3K27me3 and confer
oncogenic addiction in non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Y641, the
major incident hotpot, is present in 14–22% of germinal
center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL)
and 7–22% of follicular lymphoma (FL), while A677G
and A687G are lowest prevalent hotspots, and present
in around 1–3% in GCB-DLBCL and FL [6–9]. These
heterozygous mutations alter the substrate specificity
of PRC2, and favor the generation of H3K27me3.
Biochemical data suggest that Y641 mutant requires
the WT allele to generate H3K27me3, while A677G
functions independently of its WT counterpart [7, 10]. The
identification of these gain of function mutations provided
validation for the oncogenic potential of EZH2 and led to
a surge of interest in exploring the therapeutic potential of
EZH2 as a cancer target. As a result, potent and selective
EZH2-targeted small molecule inhibitors (EZH2i) have
recently been generated [11–13]; all compete with SAM
binding to the SET domain and thus inhibit PRC2 histone

INTRODUCTION
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is
a multi-subunit complex that selectively silences
transcription  of  target genes, through the specific
methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27). EZH2,
catalytic subunit of PRC2, utilizes its SET domain to
transfer a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine
(SAM) to H3K27. Several genetic contexts confer
dependency on EZH2 activity in cancer and lead to
accumulation of tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27me3).
Both amplification and overexpression of WT EZH2
have been implicated in tumorigenesis, and associated
with progressive disease stages and prognoses in several
cancers [1–3]. More recently, WT EZH2 has emerged
as a vulnerability in cancer associated with inactivation
in the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex, such as
SMARCB1/INI1 mutated rhabdoid cancer and ARID1A
mutated ovarian cancers [4, 5]. Three hotspots of activating

methyl transferase (HMT) activity [14, 15]. In preclinical
models, EZH2i decrease global H3K27me3 levels and
induce regression of WT and mutant EZH2 tumors [5, 13,
16]. The most advanced compounds, EPZ-6438 (E7438)
and GSK126 (GSK2816126), are currently being tested
in lymphoma patients harboring WT or EZH2 mutations
(NCT01897571 and NCT02082977). In a phase 1 clinical
trial, EPZ-6438 showed durable objective responses as
monotherapy in both DLBCL and rhabdoid INI1-deficient
patients [17].
Missense mutations that adversely impact drug
binding are commonly responsible for acquired resistance to
targeted therapies across a broad range of target classes; from
oncogenic kinases targeted by small molecule inhibitors (e.g.
imatinib and T315I in BCR-ABL), to growth factor receptors
targeted by antibodies (e.g. cetuximab and S429R in EGFR)
[18–20]. The identification and characterization of druginduced resistance mutations, either from relapsed patients,
or resistant cell lines, has guided the design of second
generation drugs that are unaffected by resistant mutants
and consequently induce profound clinical responses in
relapsed patients [21–23]. Since EZH2i have recently begun
to exhibit encouraging clinical efficacy in WT EZH2 patients
[17], it is crucial to anticipate the resistance mechanisms to

EZH2 targeted therapy. Here, we used forward genetics to
identify a mechanism of acquired resistance to EZH2i.

RESULTS
To identify mechanisms of acquired EZH2i
resistance, we used the B-cell lymphoma Pfeiffer cell
line as a model system, since it naturally harbors an
EZH2 A677G mutation that renders it highly sensitive to
EZH2i [7, 11, 12]. Pfeiffer cells were mutagenized and
subsequently incubated with varying concentrations of
EPZ-6438. After 4 weeks of incubation, drug-resistant
outgrowth was observed at EPZ-6438 concentrations as
high as 200 nM (Figure 1A). Cells derived with either
100 or 200 nM EPZ-6438 (termed E-100 and E-200,
respectively) were highly resistant to both EPZ-6438 and
GSK126, with cell viability IC50 values being increased
by at least 1000-fold (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A–S1C).
Importantly, EZH2i resistance was maintained after
2 months of drug withdrawal (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1C),
suggesting a genetic mechanism of resistance.
We next screened for the presence of drugresistant EZH2 mutations using two complementary next

the same EZH2 allele. This hypothesis was directly
confirmed by single molecule real-time sequencing, which
demonstrated that E-200 cells harbored Y111D and A677G
in the same allele (Figure 2B and S2). Collectively, these
data suggest that the EZH2 D1 domain, and particularly the
conserved residues I109 and Y111, is a hotspot for mutations
that can confer resistance to EZH2-targeted therapies.
We examined the functional impact of D1 domain
mutations by stably expressing various EZH2 mutants in
HEK293 cells. Ectopic expression of EZH2 mutants did
not affect the level of other PRC2 components, SUZ12
and EED (Figure S3A). As previously reported [7], A677G
EZH2, substantially reduced H3K27 di-methylation
(H3K27me2) and increased H3K27 tri-methylation
(H3K27me3) (Figure S3A). Of note, WT EZH2 induced
a slight increase in H3K27me3 but did not affect
H3K27me2. Importantly, A677G-driven H3K27me3 was

generation sequencing (NGS) techniques (Figure 2A): ion
semiconductor sequencing (Ion Torrent) and single molecule
real-time sequencing (PacBio). As expected, both parental
and drug-resistant Pfeiffer cells contained a heterozygous
EZH2 A677G mutation. Surprisingly, no additional SET
domain mutations were identified in the resistant cells
(Figure 2B). However, in both E-100 and E-200, a high
frequency EZH2 Y111D missense mutation (Figure 2B)
was identified. Furthermore, sequencing of the two resistant
cell lines derived with lower EPZ-6438 concentrations
(E-10 and E-20) identified two further, low frequency
missense mutations: I109K and Y111N (Figure 2B). I109
and Y111 are both highly conserved residues within the
N-terminal D1 domain of EZH2 (Figure  2C and 2D).
Interestingly, EZH2 Y111D was present at a similar Ion
Torrent sequencing read frequency to the primary A677G
mutation, suggesting that both mutations co-exist within

highly sensitive to EZH2 inhibition (Figure 3A and S3B),
thus validating HEK293 cells as a suitable model to study
EZH2 HMT function. Expression of Y111D/A677G EZH2
induced similar H3K27me3, but in contrast to A677G
alone, H3K27me3 activity was completely insensitive
to EPZ-6438 and GSK126 inhibition (Figures 3A and
S3B). I109K/A677G EZH2 mutants were also resistant to
EZH2i (Figures S3B and S3C). However, the degree of
drug resistance imparted by I109K was significantly lower
than that conferred by Y111D, thus rationalizing why this
mutation was only observed at low dose of EPZ-6438
(Figure 2B). Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that
D1 domain mutations block the ability of EZH2i to inhibit
HMT activity.
To directly assess the ability of D1 domain mutations
to confer drug-resistance, we stably expressed EZH2
mutants in Pfeiffer cells and assessed their sensitivity
to EZH2i. Similar to HEK293, Y111D mutation did not
affect EED, SUZ12 and global H3K27me3 levels in
E-200 and Y/A expressing Pfeiffer cells (Figure S3D).
Expression of WT or Y111D in Pfeiffer cells did not affect
sensitivity to EZH2i (Figure S4B). Strikingly, Y111D/
A677G compound mutations conferred both growth
and H3K27 tri-methylation resistance to EPZ-6438 and
GSK126 (Figure 3B and 3C), at a level similar to E-100
and E-200 cells. Notably, the D1 domain mutation Y111D
also conferred drug resistance in the context of the Y641
oncogenic mutation hotspot. However, in contrast to the
degree of resistance imparted by Y111D/A677G mutant
(1000 fold shift in IC50 values), Y111D/Y641F induced a
3–4 fold increase in IC50 values in both growth and H3K27
tri-methylation (Figure 3C, 3D, and S3E). Then, we
examined the functional impact of the D1 domain mutation
on WT EZH2-driven cells. HEK293 cells stably expressing
WT EZH2 were highly sensitive to EZH2i (Figure 3E
and S3F). Y111D mutation blocked the ability of EZH2i
to inhibit WT EZH2 activity to a similar extent than in
A677G. To directly assess the ability of the Y111D
mutation to drive resistance in the context of WT EZH2,
we stably expressed the Y111D mutant in a WT EZH2driven G401 cell line. The malignant rhaddoid tumor
G401 cells harbor homozygous inactivating mutations
in SMARCB1/INI1 that render them depend on WT
EZH2 activity for survival [5]. In keeping with HEK293
data, expression of Y111D in G401 conferred complete
resistance to EPZ-6438 (Figure 3F). Thus, acquisition of
a single mutation within D1 domain (Y111D) is sufficient
to drive robust resistance to EZH2i in the context of the
WT and A677G mutant EZH2, but only confers partial
resistance in the context of the Y641 hotspot.
Next, we asked whether EZH2i resistance was
dependent on EZH2 enzymatic activity by introducing the
catalytically deficient H689A SET domain mutation into
A677G and Y111D/A677G mutants [24]. As previously
reported, H689A significantly reduced the ability of
EZH2 A677G to generate H3K27me3 (Figure 4A).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Similarly, H689A also abrogated the catalytic activity
of EZH2 Y111D/A677G, indicating that Y111D/A677G
directly tri-methylates H3K27 through its SET domain.
Moreover, the catalytically inactive EZH2 mutant Y111D/
A677G/H689A was unable to confer EZH2i resistance to
Pfeiffer cells (Figure 4B). Thus, Y111D/A677G requires a
catalytically competent SET domain to drive proliferation
in the presence of EZH2i. Of note, Y111D alone had no
impact on EZH2 HMT activity, indicating that it did not
confer resistance through a gain-of-activity mechanism
(Figure S3A). Taken together, these results demonstrate
that EZH2 D1 domain mutants require HMT activity to
drive drug-resistance, rather than recruiting another HMT
(e.g. EZH1) to the PRC2 complex.
Since the D1 domain mutation did not affect the
level of the core PRC2 complex components (Figure S3A,
S3B, and S3D), we examined whether Y111D/A677G
was reliant upon EED and SUZ12 to effectively function
as an HMT. Similar to EZH2 A677G, Y111D/A677G
was dependent on EED and SUZ12 subunits to perform
H3K27me3 (Figure S4A), demonstrating that there is no
overall change in subunit dependency. There is evidence
that EZH2 recruits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)
to the PRC2 complex via its D1 domain and regulates
promoter methylation of PRC2 target genes. However,
it is not currently thought that DNMTs directly influence
EZH2 HMT activity [25]. In keeping with this, silencing
DNMT1, 3A, or 3B had no overall impact on the HMT
activity of Y111D/A677G EZH2 (Figure S4A). These data
imply that the D1 domain mutations do not significantly
affect the assembly of the minimal PRC2 components
(EZH2, EED, and SUZ12) required to undertake H3K27
methylation.
Finally, we performed a cellular thermal shift
assay (CTSA) to directly measure the impact of the D1
domain mutation on drug binding. Consistent with a
previous report [26], 52°C was determined as the optimal
temperature at which EZH2 protein is stabilized by EZH2i
(data not shown). EPZ-6438 induced a dose-dependent
thermal-stabilization of WT, A677G, and Y641F mutant
EZH2 in HEK293 cells, thus confirming the ability of
the drug to directly bind to WT and both mutant EZH2 in
cells (Figure 4C, 4D, and 4E). Importantly, Y111D totally
inhibited drug-induced stabilization of WT, A677G, and
Y641F mutant EZH2 (Figure 4C, 4D, and 4E). Thus,
acquisition of Y111D is sufficient to completely block the
binding of EZH2i to WT and mutant EZH2 (A677G or
Y641F) in a cellular context.

DISCUSSION
Using forward genetics, we have discovered a novel
hotspot of EZH2 missense mutations (Y111 and I109)
that conferred resistance to EZH2i. Surprisingly, this
mutation hotspot lies outside the EZH2 catalytic region in
its D1 domain, suggesting a unique allosteric mechanism

of drug resistance. In a cellular context, acquisition of
a single D1 domain mutation within the WT or A677G
EZH2 alleles was sufficient to drive robust resistance,
but it only conferred partial resistance in the context of
the Y641 allele. However, Y111D completely abrogated
the binding of EZH2i to WT and both EZH2 mutants
(A677G and Y641F). That Y111D/Y641F only induced
moderate resistance despite fully blocking drug binding
supports the mechanistic model of coupling between both
WT EZH2 and Y641, which was previously anticipated
from biochemical studies [7, 10]. In vitro, WT EZH2
displayed high affinity toward H3K27 and H3K27me1,
but much lower affinity toward H3K27me2. Therefore,
WT EZH2 is predicted to generate low cellular levels of
H3K27me3 at steady state and allow for the accumulation
of H3K27me3 when overexpressed. A677G is predicted
to function independently of its WT counterpart and to
efficiently catalyze the three methylation steps to generate
H3K27me3 in cells. Importantly, our data showed that a
single D1 domain mutation is sufficient to confer complete
resistance in WT and A677G-driven cells, thus confirming
that both WT and A677G mutant EZH2 can independently
support all the three steps leading to H3K27me3. In
contrast, biochemical studies suggested that Y641F
requires WT EZH2 to perform the first methylation
reaction (H3K27 to H3K27me1). Our cellular data in
Y641F-driven cells are supportive of this in vitro-based
model. Since WT EZH2 is sensitive to EZH2i, Y111D/
Y641F can only drive moderate cellular drug-resistance,
despite being refractory to drug binding. Therefore, we
provide the first cellular validation for the mechanistic
model underpinning the oncogenic function of WT, Y641F,
and A677G mutant EZH2 [7, 10]. Gibaja et al. have
recently identified a double mutation, Y111L in the WT
allele and Y661D in the Y641 allele, in a Y641N-driven
KARPAS cell line that acquired robust resistance to EZH2i
[27]. In biochemical assays, both mutants retained catalytic
activity and fully abrogated drug binding. Based on these
data, they proposed that mutations in both WT and Y641
alleles are required to drive complete EZH2i resistance
in a Y641N-driven cell line. Surprisingly, a single Y111L
mutation was also found associated to a robust resistance
phenotype in KARPAS cells (IC50 > 10 μM). Taken
together, these findings suggest that acquisition of a single
D1 domain mutation is sufficient to drive resistance to
EZH2i in WT, Y641, and A677-driven cells.
ENU mutagenesis screens have successfully
anticipated resistant mutations that emerged in patients
treated with targeted therapies: T315I BCR-ABL mutant
for imatinib [28], T790M EGFR mutant for gefitinib
[29], L1196M ALK mutant for crizotinib [30]. Given the
predictive power of such approach, these data have several
important clinical implications. Our results predict the
acquisition of a single D1 domain mutation in both WT
and mutant EZH2 patients treated with EZH2i, which is

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more likely to emerge in the clinic than a double mutation.
This is potentially clinically important considering that the
first signs of efficacy with EPZ-6438 have been reported
in patients harboring WT EZH2 [17]. We therefore
recommend not to limit to the conventional screening for
catalytic domain mutants, but to screen EZH2i relapsed
patients for EZH2 D1 domain mutations. Furthermore, the
identification of this mutational mechanism of resistance
confirms that EZH2 can function as an oncogenic driver
in GCB-DLBCL, thus further validating the therapeutic
potential of EZH2-targeted agents.
Importantly, Y111D remained reliant upon an
active EZH2 SET domain and intact PRC2 complex
to drive resistance, indicating that targeting either the
SET domain via small molecules or disrupting the
EED/EZH2 interaction via peptides [31] are viable
drug discovery strategies for second generation EZH2
inhibitors. Although the structure of the EZH2 SET
domain has recently been solved [14, 15], little structural
or biochemical information is currently available to
rationalize the discovered functional interplay between
the D1 and SET domains. Ultimately, it will be important
to understand how the various EZH2 domains regulate its
activity and/or drug sensitivity, in order to determine the
most effective strategy to therapeutically target EZH2,
while minimizing the emergence of acquired resistance.
