Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

R-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to millimolar levels in cancers with gain-of-function isocitrate
dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations. These levels of R-2-hydroxyglutarate affect 2-oxoglutaratedependent dioxygenases. Both R- and S-2-hydroxyglutarate, the other enantiomer of this
metabolite, are detectible in healthy individuals, yet their physiological function remains elusive.
Here we show that CD8+ T-lymphocytes accumulate 2-hydroxyglutarate in response to T-cell
receptor triggering. This increases to millimolar levels in physiological oxygen conditions, via a
hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha-dependent mechanism. S-2-hydroxyglutarate predominates over
R-2-hydroxyglutarate in activated T cells, and we demonstrate alterations in markers of CD8+ Tlymphocyte differentiation in response to this metabolite. Modulation of histone and DNA
demethylation as well as hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha stability mediate these effects. S-2hydroxyglutarate treatment greatly enhances the in vivo proliferation, persistence and anti-tumour
capacity of adoptively transferred CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Thus S-2-hydroxyglutarate acts as an
immunometabolite that links environmental context, via a metabolic-epigenetic axis, to immune
fate and function.

In response to T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering, quiescent CD8+ T-lymphocytes transition to
a proliferative effector state. During this response, memory CD8+ T-lymphocytes form and
can persist for the life of the organism, mounting rapid recall responses thereby providing
long-term immunity. The metabolic programs of these different CD8+ T-lymphocyte states
are distinct and important for function1–4. Effector CD8+ T-lymphocytes generate most ATP
and biomass via glycolysis5; both naïve and memory cells rely heavily on oxidative
phosphorylation 6,7. Various cytokines and transcription factors are important for the
differentiation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and it is evident that immunological memory is
influenced by epigenetic mechanisms8–12.
CD8+ T-lymphocytes traffic into severely hypoxic zones within tumours and inflammatory
tissue13. The response to oxygenation mediated via the Von Hipple Lindau (VHL) and
hypoxia inducible transcription factor α (HIFα) proteins, is an essential regulator of
metabolism and CD8+ T-lymphocyte function14–16. Here we demonstrate that CD8+ Tlymphocytes produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in response to TCR triggering and
environmental hypoxia. Using CD8+ T-lymphocyte specific genetic deletions of VHL,
HIF-1α and HIF-2α, we highlight the dependency of this metabolic feature on the HIF
pathway. S-2HG constitutes the majority of the 2HG pool and we show that S-2HG alters
the phenotypic and functional characteristics of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, maintaining a state of
increased proliferative, survival and anti-tumour capacity.

The VHL-HIF-1α axis regulates 2HG production

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To elucidate metabolic effects of HIFα activation, we profiled the metabolome of CD8+ Tlymphocytes with low (Vhlfl/fl), or high (Vhlfl/fldlckcre referred to as Vhl-/-) HIF signalling,
and HIF-1α-VHL double knockouts (Hif1αfl/flVhlfl/fldlckcre referred to as Hif1α-/-Vhl-/-) to
control for a specific contribution of HIF-1α14. Unsupervised clustering and principal
component analysis (Fig. 1a, b) separate Vhl-/- from Vhlfl/fl CD8+ T-lymphocytes.
Vhl-/-Hif1α-/- cluster with Vhlfl/fl, indicating that HIF-1α mediates significant metabolic
changes following Vhl deletion. Glycolysis is critical for sustaining effector function1–3,17
and these data indicate that VHL suppresses glycolysis via inhibition of HIF-1α, (Extended
Data Fig. 1a-c).
VHL loss suppresses late and increases early tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). Strikingly, 2HG is significantly enriched in Vhl-/- CD8+ Tlymphocytes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Furthermore, increases in 2HG depend on
HIF-1α when VHL is deleted (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This was validated using quantitative
mass spectrometry in Vhl-/- and Vhl-/- Hif1-/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Fig. 1d), as well as in
VHL-null cell lines, that express either HIF-1α (RCC4) or HIF-2α (786-O), reconstituted
with VHL (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Deletion of Vhl in murine embryonic
fibroblasts from Vhlfl/fl mice increases 2HG levels (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1f).
Hence, the VHL-HIF axis regulates 2HG levels and constitutive HIF-1α signalling underlies
this effect in Vhl-null CD8+ T-lymphocytes.

HIF-1α regulates S-2HG production

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

R-2HG is produced by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations in different cancers18–20;
accumulation of S-2HG, the other enantiomer of 2HG, occurs in the context of hypoxia21,22
and mitochondrial dysfunction23,24. We thus sought to determine 2HG levels in CD8+ Tlymphocytes following activation. 2HG before activation and at sea level oxygen is
undetectable, whereas levels at the same oxygenation are elevated 2-4 days after TCR
stimulation (Fig. 2a).When activated CD8+ T-lymphocytes are exposed to 1% oxygen, the
intracellular concentration of 2HG reaches millimolar levels (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig.
2a) and is proportional to the degree of oxygenation (Fig. 2c). We confirmed this
using 1HNMR spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Given such high levels of 2HG, we
sequenced25 Idh1/2, to preclude the unlikely possibility that culturing primary murine CD8+
T-lymphocytes in hypoxia gives rise to mutations known to cause R-2HG production in
humans18; we found no evidence for such mutations (Extended Data Fig. 3a-e). Resolving
the enantiomers of 2HG indicates that S-2HG constitutes the majority of the 2HG pool (Fig.
2d). Primary human CD8+ T-lymphocytes also accumulate S-2HG in hypoxia (Fig. 2e, f),
indicating that this phenomenon is not limited to murine lymphocytes.

We carried out deletion of loxP-flanked Hif1α or Epas1 (referred to as Hif2α) genes in
CD8+ T-lymphocytes, with cre recombinase expressed under the distal Lck promoter
(dlckcre)26 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). 2HG accumulation is abolished in Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre
(referred to as Hif1α-/-), but not Hif2αfl/fl dlckcre (referred to as Hif2α-/-) cells under
hypoxia (Fig. 2g, h and Extended Data Fig. 2d, e), with no difference in viability (Extended
Data Fig. 2f). We next examined 2HG levels in vivo, in the murine spleen. There is more
R-2HG than S-2HG (Fig. 2i); furthermore, the levels of S-2HG are significantly decreased in
spleens of Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre mice (Fig. 2i), There is also a slight decrease in the levels of
R-2HG (Fig. 2i). 2HG is present in urine of healthy individuals and is elevated in patients
with 2HG acidurias27. Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre mice have lower levels of S-2HG in urine (Fig. 2j)
indicating that HIF-1α in the T-lymphocyte (CD4+ and CD8+) compartment makes a
contribution to S-2HG production in vivo. Activated Hif1α-/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes in 21%
oxygen have lower 2HG at extended time points (Extended Data Fig. 2g), indicating a
contribution of HIF-1α in non-hypoxic conditions also.
We next sought to determine the metabolic route by which HIF-1α promotes S-2HG
production in CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Transcriptionally, hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes show
induction of glycolysis and suppression of the TCA cycle (Extended Data Fig. 2h).
Moreover, TCA cycle intermediates are decreased (Extended Data Fig. 2i). Recent reports
implicate lactate and malate dehydrogenases (Ldha and Mdh1/2), as enzymatic sources of
S-2HG in hypoxia21,22. In Hif1α-/- CD8+ T-lymphocytes, the hypoxic expression of these
enzymes suggests that Mdh1 and Mdh2 are unlikely to mediate the hypoxia-induced
accumulation of S-2HG (Extended Data Fig. 2j). Confirming this, knockdown of Mdh1 or
Mdh2 does not decrease S-2HG in hypoxia (Extended Data Fig. 2k-m); knockdown of Mdh1
leads to marginal increases in S-2HG (Extended Data Fig. 2l). Knockdown of Mdh1 or
Mdh2 increases R-2HG levels (Extended Data Fig. 2l, m). Knockdown of Ldha (Extended
Data Fig. 2k) decreases S-2HG (Fig. 2k), whilst also increasing R-2HG levels in hypoxic
CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 2n).Over-expression of Ldha in hypoxic Hif1α-/Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 26.

CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 2o) rescues S-2HG production (Fig. 2l).
Consistent with this, Ldha expression in hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes is HIF-1α-dependent
(Extended Data Fig. 2j).

We next performed 13C-labelling experiments and in agreement with previous reports21,23,
U-13C-glucose and U-13C-glutamine tracing indicates that glutamine is the major source of
2HG, (Fig. 2m, Extended Data Fig 4a-c). The m+5 isotopologue dominates, suggesting
direct conversion of glutamine-derived 2-oxoglutarate to 2HG23,21. Furthermore, the
glutamate pool increases in hypoxic (Extended Data Fig. 2p) and Vhl-/- CD8+ Tlymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and depends on HIF-1α (Extended Data Fig. 2q) but
not HIF-2α (Extended Data Fig. 2r). Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh) by
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (Pdk), promotes glutaminolysis28–30. We reasoned that
Pdk supports S-2HG production by diverting glutamine-derived 2-oxoglutarate to Ldha, and
consistent with this, dichloroacetate (DCA) abrogates hypoxia-induced 2HG accumulation
(Extended Data Fig. 2s-u). Pdk1 expression is impaired in hypoxic Hif1α-/- CD8+ Tlymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 2j), as is phosphorylation of Pdh (Extended Data Fig. 2s),
and re-expression of Pdk1 in this context increases S-2HG in hypoxia (Fig. 2l and Extended
Data Fig. 2o). Inhibition of Pdk activity also impedes hypoxia-induced increases in the
glutamate pool (Extended Data Fig. 2v). Hence, HIF-1α drives S-2HG production in
hypoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes via the Pdk-Pdh axis and Ldha induction (Extended Data Fig.
4a).

S-2HG alters CD8+ T-cell differentiation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

S-2HG inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases31,32. Consistent with this, HIF-1α
is stabilized in normoxic (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and hypoxic (Extended Data Fig. 5b)
CD8+ T-lymphocytes by treatment with cell permeable S-2HG, suggesting that S-2HG
augments HIF signalling in normoxia and hypoxia. Additionally, there is increased
phosphorylation of PDH-E1α (Extended Data Fig. 5a and b), elevated glucose uptake,
lactate secretion (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and VEGF-A production (Extended Data Fig. 5d),
indicating HIF-1α-dependent effects. Since HIF-1α supports effector functions in CD8+ Tlymphocytes13,15, we reasoned that S-2HG promotes effector differentiation via HIF-1α.
However, unexpectedly, there is suppression of effector cytokine production (Extended Data
Fig. 5e) and decreased cytotoxicity (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Furthermore, S-2HG restrains
cell expansion (Extended Data Fig. 5g) and there is a clear increase in apoptosis at doses >
300 μM (Extended Data Fig. 5h and i). Further characterization reveals decreased secretion
of IFN-γ (Extended Data Fig. 5j), yet elevated production of IL-2 (Fig. 3a), with increased
viability in the absence of IL-2 supplementation (Extended Data Fig. 5k). This possibly
reflects an autocrine pro-survival effect. These effects are robustly mediated at the
transcriptional level after prolonged treatment with S-2HG (Fig 3b. Extended Data Fig. 5l)
and are independent of HIF-1α (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig 5j and k).
We then characterized the phenotype of cells treated with a prolonged course of S-2HG.
There is increased expression of CD62L (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5m) and this is
reversible upon withdrawal of treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5n).The effect does not occur
when treating cells cultured in vehicle for 7 days (Extended Data Fig. 5n), demonstrating

Tyrakis et al.

that S-2HG treatment of newly activated cells maintains this phenotypic marker.
Importantly, CD62L downregulation does not occur when HIF-1α is absent15, masking the
effect of S-2HG on CD62L following HIF-1α deletion (Extended Data Fig. 5o). HIF-2α is
dispensable for CD62L maintenance in response to S-2HG (Extended Data Fig. 5p). With
S-2HG, CD62L maintenance depends on the level of antigenic stimulation (Fig. 3d).
Furthermore, S-2HG treated cells express more CD127 (Fig. 3c), CD44, 41BB, Eomes and
less PD-1 in a HIF-1α-independent manner (Extended Data Fig. 5q).
To determine the role of endogenously produced S-2HG, over-expression of L2hgdh
(Extended Data Fig. 5r), a dehydrogenase that oxidizes S-2HG, was performed. Overexpression of L2hgdh promotes the downregulation of CD62L in both 21% and 1% oxygen
(Fig. 3e) indicating that endogenously produced S-2HG regulates CD62L expression.
Furthermore, L2hgdh over-expression leads to an increase in the proportion of KLRG1High
cells, which are decreased in the presence of exogenous S-2HG (Fig. 3f). Conversely,
successful shRNA-mediated knockdown of L2hgdh by hairpin #3 (Extended Data Fig. 5s)
increases endogenous S-2HG levels (Fig. 3g), especially in 1% oxygen, promoting
maintenance of CD62L (Fig. 3h). Suppression of L2hgdh blocks loss of CD62L in response
to low oxygen (Fig. 3h). The same effect is seen with CD127 in low oxygen (Extended Data
Fig. 5t). These data demonstrate that L2hgdh activity regulates the expression of key
phenotypic makers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, by controlling endogenous S-2HG levels.
Transcriptionally, S-2HG treatment increases expression of Eomes, Ccr6, Bcl-6, CD62L and
Tcf-7, with repression of Prdm1, after 7 days (Extended Data Fig. 5u). This transcriptional
program is similar to gene expression changes in memory CD8+ T-lymphocytes, suggesting
that S-2HG treatment of CD8+ T-lymphocytes ex vivo may enhance long term persistence
and survival in the context of adoptive cell transfer33.

We thus co-transferred CFSE-labelled vehicle and S-2HG treated CD45.1.1 or CD45.1.2
OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes into lymphodepleted mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a) to assess their
capacity for homeostatic proliferation34,35. S-2HG-treated cells display greater homeostatic
proliferation (Fig. 4a, b), with more cells dividing >5 times (Fig. 4c).We then assessed the
capacity of S-2HG treated cells to persist in lymphoreplete mice. Adoptively transferred
CD45.1 OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes, pre-treated with S-2HG, show dramatically enhanced
persistence 30 days after transfer (Fig. 4d), expressing elevated CD44, CD127 and Bcl-2
levels relative to naïve cells (Fig. 4e)36,37. In response to vaccination with SIINFEKLloaded dendritic cells, S-2HG-treated OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes robustly recall (Fig. 4f and
Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). Consistent with this, OT-I CD8+ T-lymphocytes, pre-treated with
S-2HG are more proficient at controlling tumour growth in vivo in both lymphodepleted
(Fig. 4g) and lymphoreplete (Fig. 4h) mice. These data demonstrate that S-2HG treatment ex
vivo maintains cells in a state with increased proliferative and survival capacity, when
transferred in vivo, that is otherwise decreased by effector differentiation.

S-2HG alters methylation in CD8+ T-cells
mTOR is a modifier of CD8+ T-lymphocyte differentiation; however, we do not observe
mTOR inhibition36,38 at doses of S-2HG needed for this to occur (Extended Data Fig. 7).

genes. Two critical anti-apoptotic genes implicated in CD8+ T-lymphocyte survival are Bcl-2
and Bcl-xl39,40. These genes are not induced by S-2HG treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8ad). Moreover, over-expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl (Extended Data Fig. 8e) does not influence
the expression of CD62L, CD44 or CD127 in the presence or absence of S-2HG (Extended
Data Fig. 8f-i), indicating that S-2HG is exerting these phenotypic changes independently of
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that demethylate histones (Jumonji C
containing proteins) or oxidise 5-methylcytosine in DNA (Ten-eleven translocation (Tet)
proteins) may mediate S-2HG’s effect 32,41–43. S-2HG alters global levels of various
histone methylation marks (Extended Data Fig. 9a); in particular, di- and tri-methylation on
H3K27 are reciprocally altered, indicating inhibition of H3K27me3 demethylation (Fig. 5a,
b and Extended Data 9b). The H3K27me2/3 demethylase, Kdm6a (Utx), is an important
regulator of thymocyte differentiation44; changes in H3K27me3 levels correlate with genes
associated with regulation of CD8+ T-lymphocyte differentiation11. Global levels of
H3K27me3 in CD8+ T-lymphocytes are reduced following activation, but remain high with
S-2HG treatment in a HIF-1α-independent manner (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9c). Utx
is induced following TCR stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 9d) and inhibition of Utx
reproduces the effect of S-2HG treatment on CD62L expression (Fig 5d and Extended Data
Fig. 9e and f). In vivo, levels of H3K27me3 are highest in central memory
(CD62LHighCD44High) and naïve (CD62LHighCD44Low) CD8+ T-lymphocytes, relative to
effectors (CD62LLowCD44High) (Fig. 5e). To determine if histone methylation changes
occur at the transcription start site (TSS) of CD62L with S-HG treatment, we performed
ChIP-PCR for H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and RNA pol II, on naïve and activated CD8+ Tlymphocytes cultured with or without S-2HG (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 9g). We could
find no enrichment for H3K27me3 at or around the TSS. However, naïve and S-2HG treated
CD8+ T-lymphocytes have higher enrichment for H3K4me3 at the TSS that is reduced in
vehicle-treated cells. Additionally, S-2HG treated CD8+ T-lymphocytes have markedly
higher RNA pol II biding than both naïve and vehicle treated cells. Thus S-2HG is
promoting CD62L transcription directly with enrichment of H3K4me3 at the TSS and
indirectly via preservation of H3K27me3 elsewhere in the genome.
Total levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in genomic DNA are largely unchanged by TCR
triggering (Fig. 6a). However, total levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) decrease
following TCR triggering (Fig. 6a). 5hmC removal in genomic DNA can occur via Tetmediated oxidation (active) as well as DNA replication (passive)45,46. S-2HG treatment
induces small changes in total 5hmC and 5mC in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6b, c); at
day 3, there are marginally higher levels of 5hmC (statistically non-significant) with no
changes in 5mC (Fig. 6b, c). This is likely due to decreased proliferation in the presence of
S-2HG (Extended Data Fig 5g). Following sustained treatment, at days 7 and 9, cells have
less 5hmC and more 5mC (Fig. 6b, c). 5mC changes did not reach statistical significance at
any time point; changes in 5hmC were statistically significant at day 7 only. Nonetheless, the
changes at days 7 and 9 are consistent with inhibition of Tet proteins in the presence of
sustained S-2HG treatment.

Tet2 regulates CD4+ T-lymphocyte function and is inhibited by 2HG47,48. Knockdown of
Tet2 recapitulates the effect of S-2HG on CD62L, indicating that Tet2 also contributes to
CD8+ T-lymphocyte effector differentiation (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10a),
implicating DNA demethylation as an added epigenetic modifier of CD8+ T-cell
differentiation12. We performed both 5hmC and 5mC DIP-PCR around the TSS of CD62L
(Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig 10b). Naïve cells have the highest and lowest enrichment for
5hmC and 5mC respectively, while S-2HG treated cells display the opposite pattern. Vehicle
treated cells have an intermediate level of these two marks.

Discussion
Our data support a model in which both Utx and Tet2 contribute to effector differentiation of
CD8+ T-lymphocytes in vitro. The activity of these epigenetic modifiers is altered by S-2HG
in a fashion that inhibits effector differentiation.
TCR-triggering induced loss of 5hmC in gDNA, whereas 5mC levels were relatively stable
(Fig. 6a). 5hmC levels stabilized by 4 days after activation (Fig. 6a) and S-2HG treatment
produced reciprocal changes in 5mC and 5hmC levels at later time points (Fig. 6b, c). We
investigated 5mC and 5hmC presence at and around the TSS of CD62L (Fig. 6e). S-2HG
treatment causes reciprocal 5mC increases and 5hmC decreases in this region consistent
with inhibition of Tet proteins and transcriptional repression47, yet there is robust expression
of CD62L with S-2HG treatment (Fig. 3c, d, e and h and Extended Data Fig. 5m-p).
Inhibition of Tet2 maintains CD62L expression (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Figure 10a),
indicating that S-2HG-induced DNA methylation changes elsewhere in the genome may
indirectly promote CD62L expression.

We also investigated H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 patterns at the TSS of CD62L (Fig. 5f).
S-2HG-treated and naïve CD8+ T-lymphocytes have high enrichment for the active
H3K4me3 mark49 at the TSS that is lost in vehicle-treated cells. At least in S-2HG treated
cells, this is accompanied by binding of RNA-pol II. Despite global increases in H3K27me3
with S-2HG (Fig. 5a-c), the lack of H3K27me3 at the TSS of CD62L is not surprising, as
this mark is associated with repression49. Nevertheless, inhibition of Utx promotes CD62L
maintenance (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9e and f), indicating that H3K27me3
deposition at other genomic sites can indirectly promote CD62L expression. Due to the
relationship between histone methylation and other marks such as histone acetylation,
modulation of the latter may have similar effects to those seen with S-2HG treatment50.
Adoptively transferred cells treated with S-2HG ex vivo have an increased capacity to
proliferate and persist in vivo, with enhanced anti-tumour efficacy (Fig. 4), demonstrating a
new strategy to improve persistence of adoptive cell therapies for cancer. The data presented
uncover a metabolic-epigenetic axis that controls aspects of T-cell fate. Factors regulating
endogenous S-2HG levels, such as HIF signalling, TCR triggering, L2hdgh activity and
potentially others, can alter the differentiation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and thus shape the
immune response.
