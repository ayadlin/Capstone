Abstract
Persistent STAT3 signaling contributes to malignant progression in many diverse types of human cancer.
STAT3 is constitutively active in activated B-cell (ABC)–like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), a class of
nongerminal center derived DLBCL cells for which existing therapy is weakly effective. In this report, we provide
a preclinical proof of concept that STAT3 is an effective molecular target for ABC-like DLBCL therapy. Direct
inhibition of STAT3 with short hairpin RNA suppressed the growth of human ABC-like DLBCL in mouse models
in a manner associated with apoptosis, repression of STAT3 target genes, and inhibition of a tumor-promoting
microenvironment. Together, these results suggest that STAT3 is essential to maintain the pathophysiology of
ABC-like DLBCL and therefore that STAT3 inhibition may offer a promising approach in its therapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Among the non-Hodgkin lymphomas, the diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most frequent (30%) of
the aggressive lymphomas and is, pathophysiologically and
clinically, a very heterogeneous disease (1). In contrast to
normal cells, STAT3 is persistently activated in many diverse
human tumors, where it dysregulates the transcription of
genes involved in fundamental functions such as proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, and immune evasion (2).
High levels of STAT3 expression and activation have been
found in activated B-cell (ABC)–like DLBCL (3), which is a
subtype of DLBCL associated with a worse prognosis and
molecularly characterized by constitutively activated NF-kB,
and differing from germinal center (GC)–like subtype, which is
characterized by high levels of CD10 and Bcl-6 (4). Recently, it
has been shown that Bcl-6 is a negative regulator of STAT3
expression in GC-like DLBCL (3) and also there is cooperation
between NF-kB and STAT3 in the ABC-like subtype (5).
However, a more detailed study on the role of STAT3 in these
tumor cells has not been conducted. We analyzed several

specimens from ABC-like DLBCL patients by immunofluorescence staining, and in all of them we observed STAT3
activation (Supplementary Fig. S1), confirming previous
observations (3, 5). We therefore hypothesized that STAT3
inhibition may have antilymphoma effects.
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate whether
STAT3 could be a good target for treating ABC-like DLBCL.
The importance of this study is that treatment with antiSTAT3 drugs directed against this specific target, which is
aberrantly activated only in tumors, may be more effective and
have fewer side effects than conventional therapy. Our findings show that inhibition of STAT3 with short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) suppresses DLBCL tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of stable transduced cell lines and cell
culture conditions
Human ABC-like DLBCL Ly3 and Ly10 cell lines were a gift
from Dr. B. Hilda Ye (Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
Bronx, NY) and Dr. L.M. Staudt (National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, MD), respectively. Human GC-like DLBCL DHL-4
cell line was a gift from Dr. M. Jensen (Seattle Children's
Research Institute, Seattle, WA). Ly3 and Ly10 cells were
maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% human plasma, respectively.
DHL-4 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% FBS. The lentiviral vectors were produced as
described previously (6). Ly3 cells were then transduced at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. To select the transduced
cells, the culture medium was replaced after 24 hours with
fresh medium containing 1 mg/mL puromycin. All the experiments were carried out on cells stably transduced with the
lentivirus expressing the STAT3 shRNA no. 842 except those
for Fig. 2D, where cells were stably transduced with lentivirus

Western blot analysis
Tumor samples were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer,
which included protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Western
blot analysis was carried out as described before (9) using the
indicated antibody: rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT3 and anti–
phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705; Cell Signaling Technology); mouse
monoclonal anti–c-Myc and rabbit polyclonal anti–Mcl-1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-survivin
(Novus Biologicals); mouse monoclonal b-actin antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Cytokine antibody array
Tumor samples were digested in HBSS containing DNAse
and collagenase and processed in the strainer. Single-cell suspensions were then cultured in medium for 24 hours. Following that,
supernatants were analyzed using human cytokine antibody
array (Raybiotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Quantitative real-time PCR and PCR arrays
Total RNA was isolated and purified from cells by RNeasy
Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript
Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). For Fig. 1C, cDNAs were
analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using
primers provided by SABiosciences and iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). For Fig. 3C, cDNAs were analyzed using a PCR
array system (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. PCRs were carried out on a DNA Engine thermal
cycler equipped with Chromo4 detector (Bio-Rad).

a level of P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
We investigated the effect of STAT3 silencing in 3 different
animal models of Ly3 lymphoma (nude, NOD/SCID, and
NOD/SCID IL-2Rnull mice). For this purpose, we established
stably transduced STAT3 shRNA-expressing lentivirus Ly3
cells and control lentivirus Ly3 cells. The stable expression
of STAT3 shRNA resulted in 40% to 50% reduction of total
STAT3 protein levels compared with the control lentivirus
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
In vitro experiments revealed that STAT3 downregulation
was associated with a higher percentage of dead cells in STAT3
shRNA cells compared with the control cells, and this percentage was even higher in serum starvation conditions and after
72 hours of culture compared with 48 hours, suggesting a role
for STAT3 in the survival of those cells (Fig. 1A). STAT3
silencing inhibited the growth of Ly3 cells (approximately

3186

40% inhibition) even in the presence of IL-6 or IL-10, which
are major activators of STAT3 signaling and are important in
the pathophysiology of DLBCL (ref. 10; Fig. 1B). The percentages of Ly3 cell proliferation at 48 hours were comparable to
those at 72 hours (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar results
were obtained in Ly10 cells, showing that this strategy also
affected another ABC-like cell line (Fig. 1B). qRT-PCR revealed
that silencing of STAT3 resulted in downregulation of different
STAT3 target genes in a cell-dependent manner. In particular,
we observed significant reduction in mRNA levels of Mcl-1, BclxL, and survivin in STAT3 shRNA lentivirus Ly3 cells, as well as
significant reduction of cyclin D2 and upregulation of STAT1 in
STAT3 shRNA lentivirus Ly10 cells (Fig. 1C). STAT3 inhibition
also reduced adhesion of Ly3 cells to the bone marrow stroma
layer and migration toward SDF-1a (data not shown), an
important factor that mediates proliferation, survival, chemotaxis, migration, and adhesion into bone marrow stroma, and
has been shown to be a chemoattractant factor for B-lymphoma cells (11). We extended this strategy to a cell line
representing the GC subtype, DHL-4, which shows very low
or undetectable levels of phospho-STAT3 by Western or flow
cytometric analysis (data not shown). Cell growth and STAT3

target gene expression were not affected in these cells cultured
in vitro (data not shown), showing that GC-like DHL-4 cells do
not depend on STAT3 in terms of proliferation. These data are
in agreement with a previous study, which showed that STAT3
is downregulated in GC-like cells (3). Thus, on the basis of our
observations, we raise the possibility that GC-like cells may
generally not be dependent on STAT3; however, this suggestion
needs to be validated with additional GC-like cells.
Tumors in control lentivirus Ly3-bearing mice grew progressively (Fig. 2A), whereas tumors in STAT3 shRNA lentivirus Ly3-bearing mice regressed 4 to 5 days after injection
(Fig. 2B and C). These results were comparable to those
obtained with Ly3 stably transduced with lentivirus expressing
a STAT3 shRNA with different sequence than the original one
(Fig. 2D). Similar results were observed in Ly10 xenografts
(Supplementary Fig. S3). STAT3 shRNA Ly3 tumor regression
was associated with Caspase-3–dependent apoptosis and
significant reduction of STAT3 target genes at the protein
level such as Mcl-1, c-Myc, and survivin (approximately 40%–
60% inhibition; Fig. 3A). Survivin expression is an unfavorable
prognostic factor in DLBCL (12). We also observed 30%
reduction of IL-10 production, and the secretion of many
other cytokines was altered as well (Fig. 3B). c-Myc rearrangements and elevated IL-10 plasma levels are associated with
poor prognosis in DLBCL (13, 14). Whereas both STAT3
shRNA and control lentivirus Ly3 cells grown in vitro had
the same protein levels of c-Myc, STAT3 silencing resulted in
inhibition of IL-10–inducible upregulation of c-Myc (Supplementary Fig. S2C) associated with downregulation of IL-10–
dependent STAT3 activation (data not shown) and inhibition
of IL-10–inducible cell growth (Fig. 1B, left and Supplementary
Fig. S2B). These data suggest a role of IL-10/STAT3/cMyc in
Ly3 cell proliferation and reveal a difference between in vitro
and in vivo, where IL-10 was observed among the cytokines
that were produced the most in control tumors and reduced in
STAT3 shRNA lentivirus tumors.
It is notable that partial STAT3 downregulation (40% inhibition of total STAT3 levels was observed by Western blot
analysis) results in such dramatic antitumor effects in vivo.
This implies that Ly3 cells depend strongly on STAT3 for
proliferation and survival in vivo. Whereas in vitro studies
did show Ly3 dependency on STAT3 for proliferation and
survival, these effects were not as dramatic as the in vivo
results, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment has a
critical role in STAT3-dependent tumor cells. STAT3 signaling
is important in cross-talk between tumor cells and stroma cells
(15), and through control of expression of multiple factors is
involved in induction of angiogenesis and immune evasion (16).
Blocking STAT3 in Ly3 cells affected secretion and expression
of several factors responsible for migration of diverse stroma
cells and protumor microenvironment remodeling (Fig. 3B and
C). The most striking observation is the requirement of STAT3
signaling in lymphoma cells for induction of tumor angiogenesis, as shown by significant reduction of CD31þ endothelial
cell infiltration (Fig. 3D). Moreover, blocking STAT3 signaling
affected infiltration of Gr1þ cells, a subpopulation of myeloid
cells previously associated with tumor immune suppression
and angiogenesis (8, 17). Proangiogenic gene signatures of large

www.aacrjournals.org

B-cell lymphoma were previously associated with poor prognosis (18). Furthermore, blocking STAT3 signaling in Ly3
cells induces expression of genes involved in T-cell migration,
such as CXCL10, which was shown to be upregulated after
blocking of STAT3 in a mouse melanoma model, resulting in
increased infiltration of T cells (19).
Finally, we investigated whether small-molecule STAT3
inhibitors had antilymphoma activity like the shRNA. We
tested 2 commercially available inhibitors, STATTIC and
S31-201. The viability of Ly3 cells grown in vitro was affected
by both inhibitors tested in a dose-dependent manner and the
antiproliferative effect was associated with inhibition of
STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). The antilymphoma activity
of STATTIC was also observed in a Ly3 NOD/SCID IL2Rnull
mouse model (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of tumor growth was
significant, but not as dramatic as that mediated by shRNA,
most probably due to low efficiency of intratumoral drug
bioavailability. Nevertheless, the tumor growth inhibition was
associated with decreased levels of phospho-STAT3 in all
tumor samples isolated from STATTIC treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice.
Previous reports with STAT3 siRNA or kinase inhibitors
such as Janus activated kinase inhibitors in these tumor cells
were limited to proliferation analysis in vitro (5, 20). This is the
first demonstration in vivo that direct STAT3 inhibition in
ABC-like DLBCL suppresses tumor growth. Our data also
suggest that direct inhibition of STAT3, rather than indirect
inhibition targeting upstream signaling, may be more effective
as a therapeutic strategy for these tumor types. Moreover,
partial inhibition of target genes would be the most likely
response in the treatment of patients, due to limited delivery
efficiency of the siRNA into tumors. Thus, our results show that
even partial downregulation of STAT3 could achieve complete
suppression of the tumorigenesis of ABC-like DLBCL Ly3 cells.
Although developing a small-molecule STAT3 inhibitor as well
as siRNA delivery for clinical trials is still a challenge, our in vitro
and in vivo studies show that STAT3 is a good target for therapy
in DLBCL and also establish that STAT3 siRNA-based gene
therapy is a feasible approach for DLBCL. Our data encourage
continued development of new STAT3 inhibitors as well as
STAT3 siRNA delivery strategies for treatment of DLBCL.
