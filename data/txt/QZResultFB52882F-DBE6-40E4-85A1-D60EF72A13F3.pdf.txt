ABSTRACT:
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Although early disease is often efficiently managed therapeutically,
available options for advanced disease are mostly ineffective. Aberrant DNA
methylation associated with gene-silencing of cancer-related genes is a common
feature of PCa. Therefore, DNA methylation inhibitors might constitute an attractive
alternative therapy. Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer properties of hydralazine,
a non-nucleoside DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) inhibitor, in PCa cell lines. In vitro
assays showed that hydralazine exposure led to a significant dose and time dependent
growth inhibition, increased apoptotic rate and decreased invasiveness. Furthermore,
it also induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. These phenotypic effects were
particularly prominent in DU145 cells. Following hydralazine exposure, decreased
levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b mRNA and DNMT1 protein were depicted.
Moreover, a significant decrease in GSTP1, BCL2 and CCND2 promoter methylation
levels, with concomitant transcript re-expression, was also observed. Interestingly,
hydralazine restored androgen receptor expression, with upregulation of its target
p21 in DU145 cell line. Protein array analysis suggested that blockage of EGF receptor
signaling pathway is likely to be the main mechanism of hydralazine action in DU145
cells. Our data demonstrate that hydralazine attenuated the malignant phenotype of
PCa cells, and might constitute a useful therapeutic tool.

INTRODUCTION

time for progression to castration-resistant disease of
only 18-30 months [3]. Therefore, investigation of new
and more effective therapeutic strategies is urgently
needed for this important subset of PCa patients.
Alterations in DNA methylation are early events in human
carcinogenesis, including PCa, which are conserved
during cancer progression [4]. Aberrant methylation
of CpG dinucleotides in gene promoter regions is
associated with transcriptional repression, not only of
tumor-suppressor genes, but also of genes with important
regulatory functions [5, 6]. DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs) are a group of enzymes responsible for the
establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns.
Because epigenetic alterations, contrarily to genetic

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common
malignant neoplasm diagnosed in men and the sixth
leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1].
Although most early-diagnosed patients have optimal
survival rates after treatment with prostatectomy or
radiotherapy, treatment of advanced disease is mainly
ineffective and remains a clinical challenge [2]. Androgendeprivation therapy, by pharmacological or surgical
castration, is widely used for locally advanced and
systemically spread PCa. However, most patients that
initially respond to this type of therapy have a median

modifications, are reversible, inhibition of DNMTs
might have the ability to overturn tumor cell phenotype,
constituting an attractive therapeutic target [7]. So far
only two nucleoside analogues, 5-azacytidine (5-AzaCR) and 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) have been
approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
clinical use, specifically in myelodysplastic syndrome
[8]. Nevertheless, their clinical effectiveness is not
entirely dependent on their DNA methylation inhibitory
activity and its efficacy in solid tumors is yet to be fully
demonstrated [9]. Indeed, 5-Aza-CdR was shown to
have modest clinical activity against castration-resistant
PCa in a phase II clinical trial [10]. Due to the toxicity
of nucleoside analogues, efforts have been made to
develop and test non-nucleoside compounds that target
DNMTs, which are not incorporated in the DNA and/or
RNA, for solid tumors. Recently, we reported RG108
as an effective tumor growth suppressor in PCa cell
lines. However, this drug is substantially more effective
in androgen-responsive than in castration-resistant
cell lines [11]. Among non-nucleoside analogues,
hydralazine, a potent arterial vasodilator approved by
FDA for treatment of severe hypertension, heart failure
and hypertension in pregnancy, has been described as a
weak non-nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitor [12-14].
Furthermore, this drug has been shown to demethylate
and reactivate the expression of several cancer-related
genes and its activity is synergistic with that of the histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid, either in
vitro or in vivo [15, 16]. In patients carrying solid tumors
refractory to conventional treatment, clinical trials have
been conducted in which those epigenetic drugs were
combined with conventional therapy. It was shown that
this regimen was not only well tolerated, but, importantly,
it overcome tumors’ chemotherapy resistance and induced
radiosensitivity [17, 18]. To the best of our knowledge,
the antineoplastic effect of hydralazine in PCa has not
been previously investigated. Therefore, in the context
of a broader research project intended to determine the
therapeutic efficacy of compounds targeting epigenetic
alterations of PCa cells, we aimed at evaluating the impact
of hydralazine as a PCa growth inhibitor as well as its
effect on DNA demethylation activity and consequent
reactivation of genes known to be epigenetically silenced
in this neoplasm. Additionally, we investigated the cellular
pathway through which hydralazine exerts its growthinhibitory effect. We found that hydralazine was able to
reverse PCa cell phenotype, decrease DNMTs expression
and gene promoter methylation with concomitant
expression’s restoration of silenced genes involved in
prostate carcinogenesis. Moreover, this compound was
capable of restoring androgen receptor (AR) expression in
DU145 cell line. Importantly, we found that hydralazine
growth-inhibitory effects occur in cell cycle and EGF
receptor signaling pathway inhibition.

The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of
hydralazine was calculated in two PCa cell lines (LNCaP
and DU145) after 72 hours of drug exposure. The drug
displayed an EC50 of 63 μM in LNCaP and 30 μM in
DU145 (Supplementary Figure 1). To investigate the
effects of hydralazine on the malignant phenotype of PCa,
four human PCa cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, DU145, and
PC-3) were exposed to two different concentrations of
this drug (20 and 40 μM) or to the vehicle (PBS) during
14 days, as previously described for RG108 [11]. Cell
viability was evaluated at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14.
Exposure to hydralazine markedly reduced cell viability,
especially at 40 μM concentration (Fig. 1A). Remarkably,
a significant decrease in the number of viable cells was
observed at the day 2, with a more pronounced effect
after 14 days of exposure to both drug concentrations in
LNCaP, whereas for 22Rv1 a less impressive effect was
observed, even after exposure to the highest concentration.
PC-3 treated cells also depicted a slight reduction at
the end of day 3 through day 10. Interestingly, DU145
was the most sensitive cell line, since inhibition of cell
viability was achieved in all tested days for both drug
concentrations. These results were corroborated by
mRNA expression levels of two genes involved in cell
proliferation. Due to its low viability rate, this cell line
was evaluated after three days of drug exposure. Indeed,
a significant induction of CDKN1A and decrease of Ki67
mRNA levels was observed in hydralazine treated cells
compared to the respective vehicle (Fig. 1B). Additionally,
alterations in cell cycle distribution were evaluated and
a significant cell cycle arrest was observed at G0/G1 for
all cell lines, except for LNCaP in which the arrest was
observed at S phase (Fig. 1C). A significant increase in
apoptosis was depicted for all cell lines with both drug
concentrations (Fig. 1D). To confirm the activation of the
apoptotic pathway, CASP8, CASP9, and CASP3 mRNA
levels were also evaluated. A statistically significant
increase in transcript levels of CASP3 and CASP8 was
found for DU145, and LNCaP, respectively, whereas
CASP9 expression levels were increased in LNCaP and
22Rv1 cells (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, a significant increase
in Sub-G1 cell population was observed for three of the
cell lines [22Rv1, DU145 and PC-3 (Fig. 1C)]. The two
best responsive PCa cell lines, DU145 and LNCaP, also
showed a significant decrease in invasion ability after 48
hours exposure to hydralazine (Fig. 1F).

Hydralazine disrupts the expression of cell cycle
genes

cleaved PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair, was
found in 22RV1 whereas a decrease was displayed by
LNCaP. No changes in expression of this protein were
observed in DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. 3B).

A panel of genes representative of critical cellular
pathways were selected for assessment of expression
in LNCaP and DU145 (Fig. 2). Globally, cell cycleassociated genes were upregulated and comparative
analysis between the most altered genes in two cell lines,
allowed for the identification of five upregulated (CCND2,
ELL2, BAX, CCND3 and CCNE1) and five downregulated
(BIRC5, PARP1, CCNB1, BID and TET1) genes.

Hydralazine decreases DNMTs expression and

A reduction in mRNA expression for all three
DNMTs was depicted in DU145 and PC-3 cells. A
significant decrease in DNMT1 was achieved after
exposure to 20 µM hydralazine in DNMT3a, after 40 µM
in DU145 and with both drug concentrations in PC-3; as
well as for DNMT3b with both concentrations in both cell
lines. LNCaP only showed decreased levels of DNMT1
and DNMT3a when exposed to 40 µM hydralazine
(Fig. 4A). Notably, a reduction in DNMT1 protein
expression was observed for all tested cell lines (Fig.
4B). Gene promoter methylation status and expression

levels of five genes (GSTP1, APC, RARβ2, CCND2 and
BCL2), previously reported to be silenced by promoter
hypermethylation in PCa, was evaluated. Both LNCaP
and 22Rv1 showed a significant decrease in methylation
levels of GSTP1 with 20 µM whereas only LNCaP
exhibited similar results with 40 µM (Fig. 4C). Despite
both cell lines presented a trend for increase GSTP1
mRNA expression when exposed to 40 µM hydralazine,
only in LNCaP statistical significance was observed
(Fig. 4D). DU145 cells did not show significant GSTP1
promoter methylation. Concerning APC and RARβ2, only
22Rv1 demonstrated a significant decrease in promoter
methylation levels (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, significant reexpression of those genes was only achieved in LNCaP
and DU145 (Fig. 4D). BCL2 methylation levels were
reduced in LNCaP and DU145 (Fig. 4C) but mRNA reexpression was observed following exposure to 40 µM
hydralazine (Fig. 4D). Although a significant reduction
in CCND2 methylation was observed only in 22Rv1 and

DU145 with both drug concentrations (Fig. 4D), gene reexpression was also achieved in LNCaP (Fig. 4D).

Hydralazine induces histone acetylation in LNCaP
and DU145 cell lines
Since hydralazine induced re-expression of CCND2,
RARβ2 and APC in LNCaP and RARβ2 in DU145,
without a concomitant significant reduction in DNA
methylation, and because histone acetylation interplays
with DNA methylation, the acetylation of Histone 3
(AcH3) was evaluated by western blot in those two cell
lines. Interestingly, exposure to both concentrations of
hydralazine increased AcH3 expression in LNCaP and
DU145 (Fig. 5). In addition, histone methyltransferase
G9A expression was also evaluated, but no significant
differences were found between vehicle and hydralazine
treated cells (Supplementary Figure 2).

expression in DU145 cell line

receptor

blot analysis (Fig. 7C). Moreover, EGFR was reported to
be oncogenic activated by somatic mutations in PCa [21].
In order to ascertain if the EGFR pathway was intact in
PCa cell lines, we sequenced EGFR in LNCaP, 22Rv1,
DU145 and PC-3 cells for mutational hotspots regions. No
EGFR mutations were found in any of the four tested PCa
cell lines.

It is widely acknowledged that one of the
mechanisms of androgen receptor (AR) silencing
in castration-resistant cell line DU145 is promoter
hypermethylation [19]. After three days of exposure
to 40 µM of hydralazine a significant reduction in
AR methylation levels was observed (Fig. 6A) with
concomitant AR protein re-expression, at both drug
concentrations (Fig. 6B). Re-expression was more evident
when cells were exposed to 20 µM hydralazine. To further
demonstrate AR activation, an increase in p21 protein
expression was detected after drug exposure (Fig. 6B),
which is in accordance with the reported ability of AR to
upregulate p21 in PCa cell lines [20].

DISCUSSION
Although most diagnosed PCa remain localized,
hardly threatening life expectancy, about one third of
those tumors metastasize to distant organs and eventually
cause patient death. Median survival for patients with
localized PCa is more than five years compared with
one to three years for patients with metastatic disease.
Although first line therapy for metastatic PCa is either
pharmacological or surgical castration, most patients
become androgen refractory within a relatively short
period of time. Available therapies for castration-resistant
PCa only aim to reduce symptoms and improve in overall
survival is only about two months [2]. Therefore, new
therapeutic options for this disease stage are mandatory.
Cancer-related gene promoter methylation is an emerging
molecular marker in PCa and at least 100 genes involved
in several cellular functions are de novo methylated
during prostate carcinogenesis [22]. Therefore, DNMTi
might be a valuable therapeutic tool for PCa. The two
FDA approved nucleoside DNMTi, however, are of
limited effectiveness in solid tumors, including PCa [9,
10]. This might be due to limited incorporation into PCa
cells, which are much less proliferative, compared to
hematological malignancies. This might be overcome with
the use of non-nucleoside DNMTi, which are independent
of replication for incorporation into DNA.
Herein, we report, for the first time, that hydralazine,
a non-nucleoside DNMTi, has anti-tumoral effect in PCa
cells. This compound reduced cell viability and induced

Hydralazine may exert its growth-inhibitory
effect in DU145 cells by interfering with EGF
signaling pathway
Because DU145 showed the largest sensitivity
to hydralazine, it was chosen to investigate the cellular
mechanisms and pathways underlying these pronounced
effects, using a protein array. After drug exposure, 69
proteins presented altered expression, of which 40 were
considered downregulated and 29 upregulated (Fig.
7A). These 69 proteins were then analyzed with DAVID
(Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery) and several cellular networks were identified
as being altered after drug exposure (Fig. 7B). However,
EGF receptor signaling pathway (p-value = 1x10-8) scored
the highest significance value. Therefore, several of the
identified underexpressed members in array platform were
further validated (EGFR, EGFR phosphorylated at Y1172,
Akt1, phosphorylated Akt1 at S473, SRC, phosphorylated
C-Jun at Thr91 and S73, MEK1 and ERK1/2) by Western

time-dependent manner, being 40 µM the best drug
concentration in all tested cell lines. Similar results were

observed for human cervical cancer cells when exposed to
40 µM, resulting in 40 to 50% of cell growth inhibition and
induction of apoptosis, without affecting normal cells [15].

Importantly, both inhibition of cell viability and apoptosis
induction were confirmed at molecular level, the former
by a significant decrease in the cell proliferation marker
Ki67 and an increase in CDKN1A, a gene that codifies
p21 a well-known cell cycle inhibitor, and the latter by
induction of caspases’ expression. Furthermore, our data
also show that hydralazine induces cell cycle arrest at G0/
G1 in three PCa cell lines, which is in accordance with a
previous report in bladder cancer [23]. Moreover, LNCaP
cells also demonstrated cell cycle arrest at S phase after
hydralazine exposure, similar to human cervical cancer
cells [15]. Importantly, hydralazine drastically reduced the
invasive potential of PCa cells, a feature that is particularly
relevant because metastatic spread is a major cause of PCa
morbidity and mortality.
Exposure of PCa cell lines to hydralazine resulted
in significant induction of DNA damage, accompanied by
significant PARP-1 decrease in LNCaP cells. Interestingly,
previous studies have shown that hydralazine exposure
induced both DNA cleavage and damage [24, 25]. The
lack of efficient DNA repair is often an advantage for
cancer therapy (especially radio- and chemotherapy),
based on the concept of synthetic lethality, which states
that cancer cells are more proliferative and thus more
susceptible to induced DNA damage than normal cells. In
fact, DNA repair is considered a mechanism of cancer-

therapy resistance [26]. Currently, several agents capable
of inhibiting PARP-1 are under test and those drugs might
be useful as chemosensitizers for cancer therapy [27].
Taking in consideration our results is tempting to speculate
whether hydralazine might be useful as a chemosensitizer,
acting in concert with conventional therapeutic strategies.
Remarkably, hydralazine was not only able to
inhibit DNMT1, 3a and 3b mRNA expression in three
of the four tested cell lines, but also DNMT1 protein
expression in all cell lines. Moreover, our data indicate
that the reduction in DNMT1 expression might not be
dependent on its regulator and co-factor G9A, since no
alterations were observed for G9A expression after drug
exposure. The ability of hydralazine to reduce DNMTs
expression had already been described in other tumor
models [28, 29]. Several studies demonstrated that
DNMT1 is overexpressed in human PCa tissues, compared
to normal prostate, leading to deleterious inactivation of
tumor-suppressor genes and might be associated with
tumor progression and poor prognosis [30]. Therefore, the
reduction of DNMTs expression might be related with the
observed reversal of GSTP1, BCL2 and CCND2 promoter
hypermethylation with concomitant re-expression upon
hydralazine exposure. Interestingly, hydralazine’s ability
to demethylate the promoter region of tumor-suppressor
genes, including GSTP1, RARβ2 and p16, causing its re-

Figure 8: Proposed model for hydralazine disruption of EGF receptor pathway in DU145 cell line. Exposure of PCa cells
to hydralazine probably leads to demethylation of a critical gene that codifies a protein X that regulates EGFR phosphorylation. The reexpression of this protein will induce a significant decrease in EGFR phosphorylation and, consequently, in downstream targets, namely,
SRC, MEK1/2 and Akt. Reduced expression of SRC may cause a decrease in JNK and C-Jun proto-oncogene leading to decreased motility
and invasion capacity of PCa cells. Moreover, a decrease in MAPK pathway induced by SRC and/or directly via EFGR impairment, could
explain the decrease in proliferation and cell cycle arrest observed in this cell line after hydralazine exposure. Finally, a decrease in Akt
expression may lead to cell death and decreased tumor angiogenesis. The disruption of these cancer networks through deregulation EGF
pathway by hydralazine might be responsible for the attenuation of the malignant phenotype of DU145 cells.

expression has been documented in several cancers [23,
29]. Nonetheless, for CCND2, RARβ2 and APC, gene
re-expression was achieved without significant promoter
demethylation, in our study. Concerning the AR promoter,
a significant reduction in methylation levels was only
observed with the highest concentration of hydralazine,
although re-expression was already apparent at the lowest
concentration. These findings further demonstrate that
epigenetic silencing of cancer-related genes is a complex
phenomenon, in which other mechanisms, such as histone
post-translational modifications are also implicated, in
addition to promoter methylation [22]. Thus, the observed
increase in AcH3 following hydralazine exposure might
have contributed to CCND2 and AR re-expression.
As previously stated, hydralazine restored AR
mRNA and protein expression in DU145 cells, in which
AR is silenced due to promoter hypermethylation [19].
Similar results were reported for estrogen receptor (ER)
protein in the ER negative MDA-231 breast cancer
cell line [23]. Interestingly, AR re-expression has been
also achieved following chronic exposure (20 days) to
5-Aza-CR, resulting in a marked decrease of tumor cell
proliferation and a significant increase of AR and PSA
protein levels [31]. The lack of AR expression has been
associated with increased invasive properties, suggesting
that therapies able to restore its expression receptor may
reduce tumor dissemination [32]. Therefore, the restoration
of AR expression by hydralazine might be associated with
the observed reduction in the invasive potential of DU145
cells, and could also justify the remarkable decrease in
cell proliferation by the upregulation of its inhibitor, p21.
Hence, it is suggested that patients with castration-resistant
PCa might become more responsive to hormone therapy
following hydralazine administration, thus slowing PCa
progression. Remarkably, the combination of 5-AzaCdR with the anti-androgen bicalutamide demonstrated
a synergistic effect, increasing the susceptibility of PCa
cells to undergo apoptosis and repressing tumor growth
in xenograft mice [31, 33]. Recently, high expression
levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b have been associated
with bicalutamide resistance and, consequently, with the
emergence of the castration-resistant phenotype [34].
Because hydralazine was shown to decrease all DNMTs
expression in DU145, a synergistic action between this
drug and conventional anti-androgenic therapy is likely
to exist.
DU145 cell line was shown to be highly responsive
to hydralazine because unlike others cell lines, which
required 14 days of drug exposure to achieve pronounced
phenotypic effects, it demonstrated maximal anti-cancer
effects upon only three days of exposure. Based on the
analysis of a selected panel of 854 proteins we suggest
that the remarkable effects of hydralazine on DU145 cells
are mostly due to disruption of EGF receptor signaling
pathway. EGFR is overexpressed in PCa and plays an
important role in cancer cell growth, especially during
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

androgen withdrawal [35]. Considering the important
role of EGFR in prostate carcinogenesis, it has been
suggested that a general inhibition of this pathway
could provide therapeutic advantage against metastatic
PCa [36]. Interestingly, negative regulators of EGFR
phosphorylation (e.g., Syk) are known to be silenced
by promoter methylation in PCa [37]. Therefore, we
postulate that hydralazine may cause demethylation and
consequent re-expression of those proteins, decreasing
EGFR phosphorylation and activation. In support of
this hypothesis, DU145 cell line exposed to hydralazine
showed downregulation of all major downstream proteins
in the EGF pathway (Fig. 8). Reduced expression of the
phosphorylated form of EGFR might justify the decreased
expression of its direct targets, Src, Akt and MEK1/2. Src
has been described to be highly expressed in PCa, which
may lead to JNK and C-Jun activation and, subsequently,
to an increase in motility and invasion potential of
PCa cells. Furthermore, it may activate MEK1/2 and,
consequently, Erk1/2, increasing cell proliferation [38].
This MAP kinase pathway can also be directly activated
by EGFR phosphorylation. Interestingly, the synergism
between SRC and EGFR in PCa may be associated with
a more aggressive tumor phenotype [39]. Moreover, Akt
phosphorylation has been associated with PCa progression
and it was suggested as an excellent biomarker for
biochemical recurrence [40]. Importantly, through the
interaction with EGF pathway, hydralazine may disrupt
several cancer cell networks: by means of SRC, it may
lead to a decrease in motility and invasion of tumor cells,
through AKT, downregulate neoangiogenesis and increase
apoptosis, and, finally, through, MAP kinase pathway,
decrease tumor cell proliferation.
Because, hydralazine can maintain gene reexpression for longer periods of time, it was suggested
that it has higher demethylase activity and, therefore, more
effectiveness than 5-aza-CdR [14]. Thus, hydralazine
might be more attractive from a clinical standpoint because
to keep tumor-suppressor genes demethylated, cancer
cells need to be chronically exposed to DNMTi. Because
5aza-CdR is incorporated into the DNA, a widespread
loss of DNA methylation may occur, resulting in genome
hypomethylation, which may ultimately predispose
to neoplastic transformation of normal cells [41]. On
the contrary, hydralazine inhibits DNA methylation by
establishing highly stable interactions between its nitrogen
atoms and DNMT active site. Moreover, hydralazine has
been widely used as an anti-hypertensive agent, orally
administered on a daily basis for long periods of time
with minimal secondary effects. Thus, compared to FDAapproved 5-aza-CdR, hydralazine demonstrates a safer
profile and might be more attractive for clinical use.
In summary, we showed that the non-nucleoside
DNMTi hydralazine attenuates the PCa cell phenotype
by disrupting several cancer cell pathways, in particular
the EGF pathway in DU145 cells. Moreover, exposure to

hydralazine decreased DNMTs expression and induced
histone acetylation, which might be responsible for reexpression of genes known to be epigenetically silenced
in PCa. Interestingly, hydralazine restored AR expression
in DU145 cells, providing clues to a potential synergistic
effect with conventional anti-androgenic therapy. In
vivo studies are now mandatory to further validate the
promising role of hydralazine in PCa therapy.

three independent experiments were carried out.

Apoptosis evaluation
Evaluation of apoptosis was performed using
APOPercentage apoptosis assay kit (Biocolor Ltd.,
Belfast, Northern Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PCa cells were seeded at 1 x 104 cells/mL
onto 24-well plates. Apoptotic cells were assessed at
the end of the day 3, 7 and 14 for LNCaP and 22Rv1, 3
and 7 for LNCaP and 3 and 14 for PC-3, in a FLUOstar
Omega microplate reader at 550 nm and the background
subtracted at 620 nm. The results were normalized to
number of viable cell obtained in the MTT assay according
to the following formula (OD of apoptosis assay at day x/
OD of MTT at day x).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PCa cell lines and drug preparation
PCa cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were kindly
provided by Prof. Ragnhild A. Lothe from the Department
of Cancer Prevention at the Institute for Cancer Research,
Oslo, Norway, whereas DU145 was kindly provided by
Professor Fátima Baltazar at ICVS, University of Minho,
Braga, Portugal and 22Rv1 cells were kindly provided
by Dr. David Sidransky at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. LNCaP and
22Rv1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, DU145 cells were
maintained in MEM and PC-3 cells were grown in 50%
RPMI-50% F-12 medium (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). All basal culture media were supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37ºC with 5%
CO2. All PCa cell lines were karyotyped by G-banding (for
validation purposes) and routinely tested for Mycoplasma
spp. contamination (PCR Mycoplasma Detection Set,
Clontech Laboratories). Hydralazine was purchased from
Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved
in PBS (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For
control purposes, cell lines were exposed to the vehicle of
the drug (PBS).

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle distribution of PCa cells was determined
by flow cytometry. Briefly: 5x105 harvested cells were
fixed overnight at 4ºC with 70% cold ethanol. After
washing with cold PBS, cells were ressuspended in
staining Propidium Iodide Solution (Cytognos S.L,
Salamanca, Spain) and incubated for 30 minutes at room
temperature. All cells were then measured on a Cytomics
FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA,
USA) and analyzed using Modfit LT (Verity Software
House, Inc, Topshan, Maine, USA).

Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet Assay)
After drug exposure, 50.000 cells were harvested
by trypsinization, washed in PBS and re-suspended in 75
μl of low-melting point agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA).This suspension was then applied on top of
the base layer consisting of normal-melting point agarose
in a slide, after which it polymerized for 10 minutes at
4ºC. The slides were then immersed in lysis solution (2.5
M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM Tris Base and 1%
Triton X-100) at 4°C during 2 hours in the dark. To allow
DNA to unwind, slides were posteriorly incubated in an
alkaline electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH, 1 mM
Na2EDTA, pH 13) for 40 minutes at 4ºC. Electrophoresis
was accomplished on a horizontal electrophoresis platform
at 4ºC for 20 minutes at 15 V. Next, they were incubated in
a neutralization buffer (Tris–HCl; pH-7.5) for 10 minutes.
After fixation with ethanol 100% the slides were stained
with Sybr Green® (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA,
USA) and DNA damage was evaluated under a fluorescent
microscope. At least three independent experiments
were performed for each condition. The DNA damaging
effect in terms of DNA fragmentation was determined by
measuring four parameters that included, tail moment,

Viability assay
Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Briefly,
PCa cells were seeded at 5 x 103 cells/mL onto 96-well
flat bottoned culture plates, allowed to adhere overnight
and exposed to different Hydralazine concentrations
(i.e., 20 and 40 µM) for 14 days. At each time point 0.5
mg/ml of MTT reagent [3-(4, 5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] was added to each well,
and the plates were incubated in the dark for 3 hours at
37ºC. Formazan crystals were then dissolved in DMSO
and absorbance was read at 540 nm in a microplate reader
(FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany),
subtracting the background, at 630 nm. The number of
cells was calculated using the formula: [(OD experiment
x Number of cells at day 0) / Mean OD at day 0]. Three
replicates were performed for each condition, and at least

tail length, percentage of DNA in tail of the comet and
50 DNA-damaged cells were counted at least, for each
condition.

Proteins were extracted from whole-cell lysates
using RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA) and subsequently quantified using a Pierce
BCA assay (Thermo Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 30
µg of protein from each sample were separated using
4–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Gel at 120 V
and subsequently blotted onto Protran nitrocellulose
transfer membranes (Whatman, Dassel, Germany). For
immunodetection, membranes were incubated overnight
at 4ºC with antibodies directed against AcH3, AKT
phosphorylated (S473), C-Jun phosphorylated (S73 and
Thr91 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), Akt1, SRC (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) EGFR phosphorylated
(Y1172) (ProSci Inc., Poway, CA, USA) AR, DNMT1,
p21 and PARP1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA) at 1/500, , EFGR (Kinexus Inc., Vancouver,
Canada), ERK1/2 (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale,
New York) and MEK1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) at 1/5000. The Immun-Star WesternC
Chemiluminescent kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
was used to develop the membranes which were then
recorded with Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare
Buckinghamshire, UK). To ascertain equal loading of
protein, the membranes were incubated with a monoclonal
mouse antibody against β-Actin (1:8,000, Sigma-Aldrich,
CO., St. Louis, MO). Protein band intensities were
determined using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), by
comparing the protein band intensity with the loading
control (β-Actin).

Cell Invasion Assay
Cell invasion was determined using BD BioCoat
Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly, 5x104 cel/mL of LNCaP and
DU145 cells were added to the upper chamber. Both cell
lines were exposed to 20 and 40 µM of Hydralazine as
well as to the vehicle for 48 hours, after which the noninvading cells were removed with cotton swabs from
the upper side of the membrane. The membrane botton
containing invading cells was fixed in methanol, washed
in PBS and stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). All the invading cells were counted
under a fluorescent microscope. Three independent
experiments were performed for each condition, and at
least two experimental replicates were performed.

Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
After drug exposure RNA was extracted from cell
lines using TRIzol® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. First strand
synthesis was performed using the high-capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit from Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA, USA). Expression of target genes
(Ki67, CDKN1A, PARP1, APC, RARβ2, GSTP1, CCND2,
DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3B) was quantified using
Taqman expression assays, purchased as pre-developed
assays from Applied Biosystems and normalized to the
expression of the GUSB housekeeping gene.

Quantitative Methylation Specific PCR (qMSP)
Genomic DNA was extracted from cell lines using a
standard technique comprising digestion with proteinase K
(20mg/mL) in the presence of 10% SDS at 55ºC, followed
by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation with
100% ethanol. One microgram of DNA was submitted
to bisulfite modification using the EZ DNA MethylationGold™ Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Bisulfite modified DNA
was amplified by qMSP using TaqMan technology [42].
Specific GSTP1, APC and RARβ2 primers and TaqMan
probes were designed using the Methyl Primer Express
Software v1.0 (Applied Biosystems). β-actin (ACTB) was
used as an internal reference gene to normalize for DNA
input and all qMSP reactions were performed as previously
described [11]. Methylation levels for each sample were
derived from calibration curves constructed using serial
dilutions of bisulfite modified CpGenomeTM Universal
Methylated DNA (Millipore, Billerica, MA). GSTP1,
APC and RAR2β methylation levels were calculated after
normalization for ACTB.

Determination of differentially expressed target
genes by real-time ready arrays
After RNA extraction, 500 ng of total RNA was
used for cDNA synthesis using the Transcriptor High
Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 384-well
custom array panel (Roche Applied Science) was designed
to quantify the expression of genes involved in multiple
cellular pathways, namely apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA
repair and invasion by real-time PCR using a LightCycler
480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).
The relative expression of target genes was normalized
using GUSB, TFRC and 18S as housekeeping genes. The
fold-variation in gene expression was determined using
comparative Ct method and genes with fold change above
0.5 or below -0.5 were considered up or downregulated,
respectively.

Statistical analysis

The Kinex™ KAM-850 antibody microarray
(Kinexus Inc., Vancouver, Canada) was used to perform
an unbiased characterization of altered proteins after
hydralazine exposure. In total, this microarray featured
854 antibodies of which 517 were pan-specific (for
protein expression) and 337 were protein phospho-sitespecific (for phosphorylation). Briefly, 50 µg of lysate
protein from each sample were covalently labeled with a
fluorescent dye and unincorporated dye molecules were
removed by ultrafiltration. Purified proteins were then
incubated on the antibody microarray. After the washing
steps, the arrays were sent to Kinexus and were scanned
using a Perkin-Elmer Scan Array Reader (Waltham, MA).
Signal quantification was performed with ImaGene 8.0
(BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA) with predetermined
settings for spot segmentation and background correction.
Z ratio analysis was used to identify differentially
expressed proteins between the vehicle and hydralazine
treated cells. Three independent replicates were performed
for each condition. Functional annotation of the identified
proteins was carried out with the online tool DAVID
Bioinformatic Resources 2013 (version 6.7) (http://david.
abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with posthoc Dunnet’s multiple comparison test, when appropriate,
was used to compare the results obtained in each parameter
for the two different concentrations of hydralazine and the
vehicle. Analysis was performed with SPSS software for
Windows version 19.0 (IBM-SPSS Inc Chigaco, IL) and
statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
