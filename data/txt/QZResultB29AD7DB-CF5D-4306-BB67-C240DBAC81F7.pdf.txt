ABSTRACT
The growth factors derived from the microenvironment create an environment
conducive to tumor growth and survival. HGF deprivation using neutralizing antibody
enhanced chemosensitivity in colorectal cancer cells (CRC). We determined secreted
HGF in fibroblast conditioned medium (CM). Combination treatment of anti-HGF
antibody and irinotecan (CPT-11) directly enhanced CPT-11 sensitivity in CRC. We
generated xenograft in NOD/SCID mice inoculating HCT-116 human colorectal cancer
cells subcutaneously with or without fibroblast. We found that the combination of
CPT-11 and anti-HGF antibody induced marked suppression of tumor development.
These results suggest that HGF produced by fibroblast induce CPT-11 resistance,
and that anti-HGF antibody abrogate such resistance in vivo. fibroblast-derived
HGF is important determinant of chemoresistance. Anti-HGF monoclonal antibody
treatment confirmed the importance of this growth factor for chemoresistance in CRC.
These results present new options toward the early diagnosis of chemoresistance
and suggest novel combinations of chemotherapy and anti-HGF agents to prevent or
significantly delay the onset of therapy resistance.

INTRODUCTION

reorganization, and tumor progression [8]. Overproduction
of HGF by tumor cells or tumor-associated stromal cells
and increased expression of the c-Met protein are two
mechanisms that contribute to aberrant stimulation of this
pathway. Consequences of dysregulated HGF and c-Met
expression include tumor cell migration, proliferation, and
protection from apoptosis [9]. Overexpression of HGF and
c-Met has been detected in numerous cancer types and is
associated with a worse prognosis [10].
A bilateral collaborative effort of normal epithelial
cells and components of the stromal compartment
maintain the integrity of a normal physiological system.
The tumor microenvironment contains a diverse array of
cell types, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as
scatter factor, is a pleiotropic polypeptide growth factor
with a number of biological activities, including cell
scattering, stimulation of cell motility, mitogenesis,
morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and cellular invasiveness [13]. HGF was identified in 1984 [4, 5] and was subsequently
determined to be a heterodimeric molecule composed of
an alpha and beta chain [6]. The importance of HGF in
organ development is demonstrated by HGF null mutation
mice, which exhibit embryonic lethality [7]. In vivo, HGF
and its receptor, the c-MET proto-oncogene product,

muscle cells, macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells and
stromal fibroblasts, among others [11-13]. The stromal
cells were crosstalk not only with tumor cells but with
each other [14]. Tumorigenesis has classically been
viewed as a largely cell-autonomous process involving
genetically transformed cancer cells. Recently, many
investigations support the notion that tumor stromal cells
play important roles in tumor initiation, progression, and
metastasis [15-17]. Fibroblasts are the most frequent
component of tumor microenvironment, especially in
colorectal, breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers [18, 19].
Fibroblasts are often identified by their spindle-shaped
morphology, their ability to adhere to plastic, and their
lack of markers indicating other cell types [20]. Cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) stimulate malignant cell
proliferation by providing different types of growth factors
and cytokines in a context-dependent manner [21], such
as HGF [22], members of the epidermal growth factor
family [23], fibroblast growth factor (FGF) [24], Wnt
families [25], and IL-6 [26]. CAFs are phenotypically
and functionally distinguishable from their normal
counterparts in their increased rate of proliferation. CAFs
secrete a wide variety of growth factors, chemokines,
collagens, and matrix-modifying enzymes, collectively
supplying a communication network and altered threedimensional ECM scaffold that governs the proliferation
of cancer cells, tumor invasion, and metastasis across
tissue types [27].
Despite the large repertoire of therapies available
and the continuing efforts to incorporate new drugs
into clinical practice, innate and acquired resistances
remain intractable problems in clinical care. While the
investigation of therapeutic resistance has not surprisingly
centered on tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms to date,
recent findings have uncovered novel roles for the tumor
microenvironment in modulating therapeutic efficacy [28].
Cancer cells are in contact with their surrounding cells by
paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. The identification
of resistance mechanisms has revealed a recurrent themethe engagement of survival signals redundant to those
transduced by the targeted kinase [29]. It is possible
that evaluation of the HGF/c-MET signaling axis in the
tumor may indicate the susceptibility of that tumor to
show resistance through this pathway [30]. Indeed, higher
expression of the c-MET receptor in different cancer cell
lines correlated with their resistance to targeted therapy
stimulated by HGF [31-33]. Based on these premises,
the purpose of this study is to understand the role of
fibroblasts-derived HGF in mediating the chemoresistance
phenotype of cancer cells and the mechanism by which
this occurs.
In the present study, we demonstrated that HGF
secreted from fibroblast promotes chemoresistance of
CRC. Thus, we have focused on evaluating the clinical
significance of HGF/c-Met axis in cancer chemotherapy.
The identification of stromal HGF as a mediator of CPTwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

11 resistance has important translational potential. In
addition to this, we investigated the effects of anti-HGF
monoclonal antibody on cancer chemoresistance.

RESULTS
CM from colonic fibroblast rescues colorectal and
lung cancer cells from growth suppressive activity
of CPT-11
We postulated that innate drug resistance might be
caused at least in part by factors secreted by the tumor
stromal cells. While growth and metastasis-promoting
effects of the stromal cells have been well reported [34],
a role in drug resistance has only been partially described
[35, 36]. To determine if the rescue effect was activated
by the secretion factors, we tested the ability of CM
from fibroblasts to recapitulate the resistance effect.
For this purpose, cancer cells were treated with CPT11 at concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 20 μM with
or without CM from fibroblasts for 48 h. As shown in
Figure 1A, cell proliferation was significantly suppressed
by CPT-1 in all the human cell lines as compared with
the vehicle control. Under these experimental conditions,
cells became highly resistant to CPT-11 in the presence of
CM from fibroblasts. CM from fibroblasts rescued human
cancer cells from CPT-11, indicating that the rescue was
due to a factor secreted by the fibroblasts. Similar results
were obtained when we determined apoptosis of cells by
annexin-V/PI staining after incubation of cells with CPT11 in the presence of CM from fibroblasts (Figure 1B).
CPT-11 caused apoptosis in DLD-1 and HCT116 cells;
however, CM from fibroblast significantly attenuated
apoptotic cell death in response to CPT-11. Figure 1
indicates that CM from fibroblasts enhanced the resistance
against CPT-11 in cancer cells and suppressed apoptotic
cell death, indicating that secreted factors from fibroblasts
are crucial for sustaining cancer cell survival.

HGF derived from fibroblasts activates c-Met
receptor in cancer cells
To determine whether fibroblast-derived HGF
is responsible for CPT-11 resistance, we measured the
amount of HGF in the CM from fibroblasts. HGF is not
expressed in epithelial cells and therefore c-Met receptor
requires HGF production by surrounding stromal cells
for ligand-dependent activation [37]. As shown in Figure
2A, the ELISA assay demonstrated that HGF production
is only shown in CM from fibroblast. The c-Met receptor
tyrosine kinase activation induces pleiotropic biological
effects in a wide variety of cells, including mitogenic,
motogenic, morphogenic, and anti-apoptotic activities

[10, 38]. To determine whether fibroblast-derived HGF
activates the c-Met receptor resulting in CPT-11 resistance,
we treated cells with CM from fibroblasts. We detected
c-Met activation by treatment of fibroblasts-derived CM
(Figure 2B). To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we
performed co-culture experiments with fibroblasts and
cancer cells. We investigated whether fibroblasts in coculture adopted compensatory mechanisms such as the
activation of the c-Met receptor and increased resistance
to CPT-11 by cancer cells. As shown in Figure 2C and
2D, co-culture with fibroblasts induced resistance to
CPT-11 and activated the c-Met receptor in cancer cells.
To determine whether HGF is directly implicated in the
activation of c-Met and the resistance to CPT-11, we
knocked-down HGF by siRNA and measured cell viability
in the presence of CPT-11. The HGF siRNA significantly
suppressed HGF expression in CCD-18co cells (Figure
2E). As expected, CM from HGF siRNA treated cells

failed to rescue cancer cells from the apoptosis by CPT11 (Figure 2F). These results confirm the importance of
fibroblast-derived HGF in CPT-11 resistance of cancer
cells and indicate that HGF might be a therapeutic target
for overcoming resistance to CPT-11.

HGF stimulated CPT-11 resistance in colorectal
cancer cells
To test whether HGF directly contributes to the
effect on overcoming CPT-11 resistance in cancer cells,
anti-HGF antibody was added to the CM to neutralize the
HGF activity. The viability of cancer cells in the CM from
fibroblasts was significantly decreased by the addition
of 200 ng/ml of the anti-HGF antibody (Figure 3A). To
determine the inhibitory effect of anti-HGF antibody in
conditions mimicking a tumor microenvironment, co-

cultures of fibroblasts and cancer cells were subjected
to MTT assay (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B,
neutralization of fibroblast-derived HGF maintained the
reduction in cell viability induced by CPT-11 indicating
that HGF targeting significantly enhances CPT-11
stimulated anti-cancer activity. Taken together, our
findings suggest that the fibroblast-derived HGF may
play an important role in cancer cell survival and that the
interference with its effect in tumor cells may represent a
novel strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancers.

To examine the possible induction of CPT-11
resistance by fibroblast-derived HGF and the efficacy of
combined treatment with anti-HGF antibody and CPT11 on colorectal cancer in vivo, we generated xenografts
by inoculating HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells,
with or without fibroblast CCD-18co cells, into NOD/
SCID mice subcutaneously. We found that the mice
injected with HCT116 plus CCD-18co cells had tumors
that grew significantly faster than those in mice injected
with HCT116 cells alone. CPT-11 treatment suppressed
the growth of tumors in mice grafted with HCT116 plus
CCD-18co cells. Interestingly, the combination of CPT11 and anti-HGF antibody treatment induced the strongest
suppression of tumors. The in vivo tumor growth analysis
showed that injecting mice with HCT116 and CCD-18co
cells led to significantly faster tumor growth as compared
with only injecting HCT116 cells (2653.04 ± 396.62
mm3 versus 1775.46 ± 257.53 mm3 p < 0.001). Marginal
suppression was observed with CPT-11 treatment (1775.46
± 257.53 mm3 versus 850.38 ± 183.15 mm3, p < 0.05).
The combination treatment with CPT-11 plus anti-HGF
significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared to the
control group, HCT-116 plus CCD-18co group and the
HCT-116 plus CCD-18co treated with CPT-11 groups
(1775.46 ± 257.53 mm3 versus 467.57 ± 81.90 mm3, p
< 0.001; 2653.04 ± 396.62 mm3 versus 467.57 ± 81.90
mm3, p < 0.001; 850.38 ± 183.15 mm3 versus 467.57
± 81.90 mm3, p < 0.05, respectively). At the end of the
experiment, tumor weight in the control, HCT-116 plus
CCD-18co, HCT-116 plus CCD-18co with CPT-11, and
HCT-116 plus CCD-18co with CPT-11 plus anti-HGF
groups were 1.15 ± 0.27 g, 1.88 ± 0.31 g, 0.61 ± 0.20
g and 0.35 ± 0.15 g, respectively. These results suggest
that anti-HGF antibody abrogates fibroblast-derived HGFinduced CPT-11 resistance in vivo (Figure 5A and 5B). To
determine whether anti-HGF antibody decrease HGF/cMet signaling, we examined the expression of phospho-cMET by immunofluorescence and western blotting (Figure
5C and 5D). Our data revealed that c-Met signaling was
suppressed in the anti-HGF antibody treatment group
when compared to HCT-116 plus CCD-18co and HCT116 plus CCD-18co with CPT-11 groups. In addition, a
fibroblast marker (ER-TR7) was detected in HCT116 plus
CCD-18co tumors. Whereas, the tumors in mice injected
with HCT116 alone did not produce a detectable level of
ER-TR7 (Figure 5C). As expected, tumors in the antiHGF antibody and CPT-11 treatment group contained
a significantly higher number of TUNEL positive and
cleaved caspase-3 positive cells as compared with HCT116 plus CCD-18co and HCT-116 plus CCD-18co with

Humanized anti-HGF antibody attenuated HGF
activated c-Met signaling pathway and enhanced
apoptotic cell death induced by CPT-11 in
colorectal cancer cells
To examine the effects of anti-HGF antibody on
cell signaling and apoptosis in cancer cells, we performed
Western blot analysis. Anti-HGF antibody (200 ng/ml)
effectively suppressed c-Met, AKT, and ERK activation
induced by recombinant HGF (50 ng/ml) in HCT116
cancer cells (Figure 4A). Anti-HGF antibody (200 ng/
ml) enhanced cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 which
are apoptotic molecules induced by CPT-11 (Figure 4B
upper panel). Anti-HGF antibody also enhanced cleavage
of PARP and caspase-3 induced by CPT-11 in HCT116
cells co-cultured with CCD-18C human colon fibroblast
cells (Figure 4B, lower panel). These results indicate that
HGF-induced CPT-11 resistance is activated by HGF/cMet signaling and is abrogated by treatment with antiHGF antibody. Furthermore, we examined whether antiHGF antibody augmented apoptotic cell death inhibited
by recombinant HGF. We found that CPT-11 induced
significant apoptotic cell death, recombinant HGF
inhibited that apoptosis, and anti-HGF antibody reversed
such inhibition. For example when cells were treated with
CPT-11 alone, 5 μM of CPT-11 increased apoptotic cell
death in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells by 67.75 % and 39.73
%, respectively. When cells were treated with recombinant
HGF after treatment with 5 μM CPT-11, apoptotic activity
was suppressed by 32.55 % and 10.19 % in HCT116 and
DLD-1, respectively. The rescue effect stimulated by
recombinant HGF was attenuated by anti-HGF antibody
(200 ng/ml) (43.85 % and 20.52 % in HCT116 and DLD1, respectively). These results indicated that CPT-11
resistance is induced by fibroblast-derived HGF/c-Met
signaling and is attenuated by treatment with anti-HGF
antibody in colorectal cancer cells.

results suggests that cancer associated fibroblasts could

CPT-11 resistance in colorectal cancer cells. Our finding
indicates that HGF is involved in CRC chemoresistance.
The administration of anti-HGF antibody significantly
reverses the chemoresistance effect of fibroblast-derived
HGF in vivo and in vitro.
Multiple biological actions of HGF, mediated via
c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, are outlined. These
activities depend on downstream adaptor molecules
recruited by c-Met tyrosine-phosphorylated multi-docking
sites [10]. These phosphotyrosines stimulate high-affinity
interactions with various src homology region 2-containing
cytoplasmic effectors, including Gab1, PI3-kinase, Shc,
and Grb2. We demonstrate here that HGF activates Akt
and ERK signaling pathways which inhibited apoptosis
processing in CRC. Different studies suggest that HGF
triggers anti-apoptotic signals [49-51]. The present study
demonstrates that fibroblast-derived HGF can protect cells
from apoptosis by means of both Akt and ERK signaling.
Our data indicate that fibroblast-derived HGF rescues cells
from apoptosis and that the anti-HGF antibody sensitizes
cells to apoptosis and abolishes HGF protection.
When human colorectal cancer cells were inoculated
with colonic fibroblast cells in immunodeficiency mice,
they enhanced drug resistance to CPT-11. This finding is
consistent with other reports that have shown that acquired
resistance to chemotherapy reagents is a problem [52-54].
Indeed, our research has shown that anti-HGF antibody
can reverse the fibroblast-derived resistance to CPT-11.
This phenomenon, besides highlighting the importance
of the tumor microenvironment, further confirms that
fibroblast-derived HGF/c-MET signaling is involved
in resistance to chemotherapy reagents. In our in vivo
models, the combination of CPT-11 with anti-HGF
antibody showed a potent anti-cancer effect on human
colorectal cancer, as evidenced by the strong inhibition
of tumor growth and interference with c-MET signal
transduction. We also demonstrated that combination
treatment was significantly associated with the induction
of apoptotic cell death. Consistently, our research suggests
that the combination treatment of CPT-11 with anti-HGF
could interfere with the process of acquired. In summary,
HGF appears to play a substantial role in the complex
mechanisms involved in the induction of chemoresistance
of colorectal cancer by fibroblasts.
In summary, we identified fibroblast-derived HGF
activated CPT-11 resistance through c-MET signaling
pathways. Our findings point to the micro-environment as
an important factor but this does not preclude the likely
involvement of other growth factors and/or cytokines.
Moreover, our results suggest that such resistance
mechanisms can be uncovered through the systematic
dissection of interactions between tumors and their microenvironment. Future studies should therefore seek to
identify such resistance mechanisms for all of the drugs
that are in development, potentially leading to mechanismbased combination regimens such as the CPT-11 and

DISCUSSION
Irinotecan (CTP-11) is a semi-synthetic analog
of camptothecin, which was originally isolated
from Camptotheca acuminate [39]. CTP-11 inhibits
topoisomerase-1 (Topo-I) activity by trapping Topo-I-DNA
cleavage complexes, leading to lethal replication-mediated
double strand breaks [40]. CPT-11 is used as a first- and
second-line chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent
colorectal cancer and has shown activity in patients with
advanced colorectal cancer resistant to leucovorin (LV)
and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [41, 42]. Although treatment
of advanced CRC patients with CPT-11 as a single agent
has shown response rates of approximately 25 %, these
rates can reach 60 % when used in combination with
other agents [43, 44]. However, the efficacy of CPT-11
is strongly limited by the development of drug resistance.
Classically, drug resistance may be due to modulated
drug influx/efflux, gene amplification and subsequent
overexpression of the target molecule or alteration in
drug target specificity drug detoxification by increased
levels of drug target, enhanced DNA repair in the case of
DNA-damaging drugs or NF-kB activation [39]. Recent
studies have proposed that microenvironment could be
associated with chemoresistance [45]. Stromal cells could
potentially induce chemoresistance acquisition in tumor
cells, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions,
local release of soluble factors and so on [46-48]. We
hypothesized that fibroblasts generate soluble factors that
could stimulate resistance to chemotherapy. The fibroblast
cell line CCD-18co conditioned medium can support the
survival of colorectal cancer cells against CPT-11. Using
co-culture experiments in vitro and in vivo, we found that
a minority of CCD-18co cells could rescue the colorectal
cancer cells from CPT-11 treatment.
These results indicate that a novel strategy, targeting
the crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts,
may be important for circumventing the drug resistance
of colorectal cancers. By using colonic fibroblast cell
line CCD-18co and chemotherapy drug CPT-11, we
demonstrate that fibroblasts play a functional role in
chemoresistance of colorectal cancer cells presumably
through fibroblast-derived HGF in tumors via c-MET
signaling. Our results revealed that CPT-11 resistance of
colorectal cancer cells were enhanced upon exposure to
CCD-18co CM and co-culture with CCD-18co cells in
vitro. Furthermore, CCD-18co cells produced and secreted
HGF in CM and c-Met (receptor tyrosine kinase of HGF)
was activated upon exposure to CCD-18co CM. HGF
neutralizing antibody effectively reduces the activation of
HGF/c-MET signaling, which blocks its ability to promote

and phosphatase inhibitors, as described elsewhere [56].
Equivalent amounts of protein (20-80 µg) were loaded
onto 10 % or 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred by
blotting to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The blot
was incubated with primary antibodies for over nigh
at 4°C and then Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperrature. The
protein-antibody complexes were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol.

Apoptosis analysis
Apoptosis was determined by FACS analysis using
propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin-V-FITC (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). Briefly, cancer cells were plated in 6 well
plates with or without CM derived from CCD-18co cells.
Cells were treated with different concentrations of CPT-11
with or without anti-HGF antibody the next day. After 48
h, cells were collected, re-suspended in binding buffer, and
incubated with PI and Annexin-V-FITC for 10 min at 4 °C.
Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry, using a FITC
signal detector with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm
and an emission of 530 nm (to detect Annexin-V -FITC),
and a PI signal detector with an excitation wavelength
of 496 nm and an emission of 615 nm (to detect PI). We
defined “apoptotic cell death” as the population of cells
that were positive for annexin-V-FITC staining.

Conditioned medium preparation
Conditioned medium (CM) were generated from
70-80 % confluent CCD-18co human colonic fibroblasts
cultured with serum free RPMI1640 for 48h. All cellular
debris was removed by filtration (0.4 μM). The level of
human HGF in CM was determined by using Human
HGF ELISA KIT (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
HGF knockdown studies, early-passage CCD-18co cells
were transfected with 10 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Conditioned medium
from HGF siRNA transfected CCD-18co cells were used
to assess colorectal cancer cell proliferation assays.

In vivo xenograft models
For xenograft model, 5-6 week-old NOD/SCID
mice (NOD/LtSz-Prkdcscid/J) were purchased from
KRIBB (Cheongwon-gun, Korea). HCT116 human
colorectal cancer cells 5 x 106 in 100ul of PBS were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left flank. HCT116
human colorectal cancer cells 4.5 x 106 and 5 X 105
CCD-18co cells were injected in the right flank. Tumor
volumes were calculated as length × width2 × 0.5. Mice

Assay for cell proliferation
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (SPL, Seoul.
Korea) and cultured 24 h before exposure for 48 h to
various concentrations of CPT-11, recombinant HGF, or
anti-HGF antibody, as indicated. Following this, 20 μl
of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium

were weighed and tagged and when the tumor reached
the standard volume of approximately 200 mm3, the mice
was randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n =
5): Control; CPT-11treatment; humanized anti-HGF Ab
treatment; CPT-11/humanized anti-HGF Ab combination
treatment. CPT-11 (10 mg/kg, three times a week) and
humanized anti-HGF (40 mg/kg/day, twice a week) were
administered intra-peritoneally for 3 weeks. Tumors were
measured twice weekly using digital calipers. All animal
experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer Center.

The tumors were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical
assays and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated UTP end-labeling (TUNEL) staining was done
as previously described [57]. For immunohistochemistry,
sections were incubated with cleaved caspases-3
antibodies overnight at 4°C. Antibody detection was
performed using the EnVision detection system (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Another part of the tumors was
sectioned for TUNEL staining for the measurement of
apoptosis. TUNEL assay was performed as previously
described [57]. For apoptosis analysis, we counted all
nuclei in the field as well as all TUNEL-positive cells
in three to five randomly selected fields of view at a
magnification of ×200.
