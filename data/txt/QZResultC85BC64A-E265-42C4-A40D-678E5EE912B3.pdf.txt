ABSTRACT
As an approach to improve treatment of breast cancer metastasis to the brain,
we employed genetically engineered stem cells (GESTECs, HB1.F3 cells) consisting
of neural stem cells (NSCs) expressing cytosine deaminase and the interferon-beta
genes, HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β. In this model, MDA-MB-231/Luc breast
cancer cells were implanted in the right hemisphere of the mouse brain, while prestained GESTECs with redfluorescence were implanted in the contralateral brain.
Two days after stem cells injection, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) was administrated via
intraperitoneal injection. Histological analysis of extracted brain confirmed the
therapeutic efficacy of GESTECs in the presence of 5-FC based on reductions in density
and aggressive tendency of breast cancer cells, as well as pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and
karyolysis relative to a negative control. Additionally, expression of PCNA decreased
in the stem cells treated group. Treatment of breast cancer cells with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) increased the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative factor, BAX
and p21 protein through phosphorylation of p53 and p38. Moreover, analysis of stem
cell migratory ability revealed that MDA-MB-231 cells endogenously secreted VEGF,
and stem cells expressed their receptor (VEGFR2). To confirm the role of VEGF/
VEGFR2 signaling in tumor tropism of stem cells, samples were treated with the
VEGFR2 inhibitor, KRN633. The number of migrated stem cells decreased significantly
in response to KRN633 due to Erk1/2 activation and PI3K/Akt inhibition. Taken
together, these results indicate that treatment with GESTECs, particularly HB1.F3.CD.
IFN-β co-expressing CD.IFN-β, may be a useful strategy for treating breast cancer
metastasis to the brain in the presence of a prodrug.

INTRODUCTION

brain metastases, patients may suffer from neurological
symptoms that include headaches, focal weakness,
mental disturbance, seizures, and ataxia [6]. Metastasis
is responsible for most cancer deaths [7]. Breast cancer
metastases are the second most common type of brain
metastases, followed by lung cancer, and these are
generally found in younger and premenopausal women [8].
Breast cancer metastases are also more common in women
with triple negative or human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)/neu positive breast cancer [9]. For
breast cancer patients, the prevalence of brain metastases
has historically been estimated to be 10–16% with a
1-year survival rate of 20% [10]. Therapeutic approaches

Metastasis is the movement of cancer cells from
primary tumor sites to distant organs and tissues,
including the brain, liver, and bones, via the blood and
lymphatic vessels [1]. Metastasis is the result of several
sequential steps, intravasation, invasion, extravasation,
and micrometastases [2, 3]. Lung (40–50%), breast
(15–25%), melanoma (5–20%), colon and kidney related
primary cancer commonly spread to the brain [4]. About
80% of metastatic lesions are located in the cerebrum
hemispheres, while 15% are located in the cerebellum and
5% in the brainstem [5]. Depending on the location of the

to brain metastases include chemotherapy, surgery, whole
brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery
(SRS) supplemented with corticosteroid therapy for
symptomatic relief [11]. While surgical treatment of the
primary tumor may be successful, therapies for metastatic
breast cancer carry the risk of neurological and cognitive
deficits. Recently, treatment of MDA-MB-231, aggressive
breast cancer cells, with a monoclonal antibody specific
for ROR1 inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion
in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo, indicating that ROR1
may suppress breast cancer progression and metastasis via
regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [12].
As an alternative therapy for metastatic breast
cancer, neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human
fetal telencephalon tissues at 15 weeks were used for
neural stem cell-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy
(NDEPT) [13, 14]. The NSCs were immortalized using
a retroviral vector carrying v-myc oncogene and were
genetically engineered to express therapeutic genes,
bacterial cytosine deaminase (CD) and human interferonbeta (IFN-β) [15]. The CD gene, which is a suicide genes,
can convert 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), a non-toxic agent,
into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a toxic agent, which inhibits
DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in cancer cells
[16]. Additionally, IFN-β is a member of the type I IFN
family (IFN-alpha (IFN-a) and IFN-omega (IFN-w))
that suppresses tumor cell growth via the induction of
differentiation, S-phase accumulation and apoptosis
[17]. Although high concentrations of IFN-β are known
to inhibit malignant cell growth in vitro, the in vivo
therapeutic utility is limited by its excessive toxicity when
administered at high doses [18]. Because it has shown
limited response owing to its short half-life, IFN-β cannot
reach the concentration required to suppress tumor cell
growth [19]. The results of several in vitro and in vivo
investigations of the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) showed that modulation of the tumor necrosis
factor-related apoptosis-including ligand (TRAIL)/
TRAIL receptor-mediated cytotoxic pathway might
partially contribute to the clinical efficiency of combined
treatment with 5-FU and IFN-β without hepatotoxicity or
toxicity against normal tissues [20]. In the previous study,
type I IFN receptor type 2 (IFNAR2)-positive cancer cells
showed a positive clinical response to combination therapy
of type I IFNs and 5-FU [21]. Wada et al. also confirmed
that synergistic and anti-angiogenic effects of IFN-a and
5-FU combination therapy may contribute to the antitumor effects against HCC through regulation of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins [22].
Stem cells can also migrate toward tumors to
interact with several growth factors secreted by tumor
cells [23]. The therapeutic treatment by engineered
stem cells is a novel strategy where the combination
of the migration capacity of stem cells as a vector for
therapeutic genes towards diverse human tumors [13, 14,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

16, 17, 24–26]. A synergistic antitumor effect of CD and
IFN-β genes can selectively target these types of human
cancers [27]. However, the molecular mechanisms for
NSCs mobilization against various tumors have not been
identified. In another study, exposure of stromal cellderived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1a) to quiescent NSCs was
found to enhance proliferation, promote chain migration
and transmigration, and activate intracellular molecular
pathways mediating engagement [28]. Schmidt et al.
demonstrated that VEGF is a strong signal for guiding the
in vivo migration of NSCs from distant sites in the adult
brain [29]. VEGF is a typical angiogenic growth factor
that acts as a potent mitogen and is known for exerting
neuroprotective effects against ischemic injury [30].
Therefore, undetectable dormant single metastatic cells
or prevascular micrometastases can be treated via tumor
tropic properties of stem cells expressing therapeutic
genes.
The present study describes the potential for use of
genetically engineered stem cells (GESTECs) to reduce
tumor growth via tumor tropic effects in metastatic breast
cancer animal models. Our results showed that synergistic
effects of 5-FU and IFN-β co-treatment in a breast
cancer cell line can lead to apoptosis and proliferation
related protein activation through p53 and p38. We also
investigated whether NSCs have a significant capacity
to migrate via VEGF signaling as well as a therapeutic
effect. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the
potential for use of NDEPT-based IFN-β therapy to treat
breast cancer metastasis to the brain.

RESULTS
Metastatic breast cancer mice models and
therapeutic effects of stem cells
As shown in Figure 1A, we demonstrated the
therapeutic effect of hNSCs with 5-FC in breast cancer
metastasis to the brain. To monitor the effects of hNSCs
on the growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-231/Luc cells
in live mice, cells were implanted into the mouse brain.
In this experiment, one week after MDA-MB-231/Luc
cells implantation, 32 mice were randomly divided into
four groups. Three groups of mice received stem cells
(HB1.F3, HB1.F3.CD, HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells) and
5-FC (500 mg/kg/day) treatment, while another group
of mice received only the vehicle (saline). The antitumor
effect of hNSCs expressing therapeutic genes with
5-FC was evaluated weekly after injection of stem cells by
measurement using an IVIS imaging system (Figure 1C). The
bioluminescence imaging results indicated a significant
decrease in the tumor volume of HB1.F3.CD or HB1.
F3.CD.IFN-β cells with 5-FC treated mice relative to

volume using a veterinary caliper. Significant inhibition
of tumor growth (approximately 30–40%) was observed
relative to the negative control or HB1.F3 cells treated
groups in HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cell treated
groups (Figure 1B). These results were in accordance
with the results of bioluminescence imaging of live mice.
Moreover, all mice in the negative control or HB1.F3
cells injected groups survived until day 25. However,
HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β and 5-FC co-treated mice survived
significantly longer than any other groups, living until
day 43 (Figure 1E). In the HB1.F3.CD plus 5-FC treated
group, all mice were still alive at day 35. It should be
noted that mice treated with HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.
IFN-β in the presence of 5-FC showed a prolonged
survival rate when compared with the untreated control
or HB1.F3 treated groups.

We conducted histopathological analysis of
excised metastatic breast cancer in all groups of mice.
Histopathological examination of excised brains of mice
from all groups confirmed the growth of breast cancer in
the mouse brain. H & E staining showed that cancer cells
grew well in the negative control or HB1.F3 cells treated
groups, with clear atypia and no major tumor necrosis
(Figure 2A). Conversely, HB1.F3.CD cells in the 5-FC
treated group showed smaller zones of cancer cell necrosis
or apoptosis. Progression of tumor necrosis or apoptosis
occurred more frequently in HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells plus
5-FC treated mice. In the treatment with HB1.F3.CD or
HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells, the aggressiveness of cancer
cells, nuclear size or density were significantly decreased.

gene in stem cells, 5-FC (500 mg/kg/day) was administrated as a prodrug via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection once a day 5 days per week for
2 weeks. (A) Schematic diagram of mouse models. (B) Volume of excised brain tumor. After the final 5-FC injection, brains were excised

IHC staining for PCNA in metastatic breast cancer
sections of all mice was used to investigate the overall
pattern of expression. Proliferative tumor cells showed
stronger nuclear staining in negative control or HB1.F3
treated mice than in HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β
plus 5-FC treated mice (Figure 2B). In groups treated with
stem cells expressing CD and/or IFN-β genes, expression
of the PCNA protein decreased significantly in tumor
burden of the brain, with a greater reduction occurring in
the HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells treated group.

significantly lower in the KRN633 pre-treated group than
the KRN633 non-treated group. Overall, the amount of
stem cells that migrated toward breast cancer cells was
four times lower in the VEGFR2 signaling inhibited group
(Figure 3C).

Downregulation of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
following KRN633 treatment
We evaluated the effects of VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling on tumor tropic ability of stem cells under
the assumption that reduction of VEGF and VEGFR2
interaction would be correlated with the migratory ability
of stem cells. KRN633 applied at 50 or 100 mM as a
VEGFR2 inhibitor was used to treat 6-well cultured stem
cells, and total RNA was extracted with RNA extraction
solution after 3, 6, 9, or 24 h. The VEGFR2 gene was
continuously expressed in stem cells following KRN633
treatment (Figure 4A), while there was no change in the
expression level of the VEGFR2 gene (Figure 4B).
For analysis at the protein level, we harvested the
total protein within one hour of KRN633 treatment. We
then examined p-Erk1/2, p-Akt1/2/3, and c-fos protein
expression by immunoblotting in HB1.F3.CD cells

Inhibition of tumor tropic effect of stem cells via
VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
The migration of hNSCs toward MDA-MB-231/Luc
was assessed using transwell chambers. Migration ability
of stem cells was dramatically influenced by several
chemoattractant factors (uPA, VEGF, MCP-1, and SCF)
secreted by MDA-MB-231/Luc cells (Figure 3A). To
confirm these results, we conducted an inhibition study
using KRN633 as a VEGFR2 inhibitor. HB1.F3.CD cells
were pre-treated with the inhibitor (100 mM) for 1 h before
the migration assay. As shown in Figure 3B, the number
of migrated CM-DiI labeled hNSCs (stained in red) was

(Figure 4C). Interestingly, Erk1/2 phosphorylation was
induced in HB1.F3.CD cells, and expression of p-Erk1/2
was more sustained in KRN633 100 mM treated stem
cells for one hour when compared to control or 50 mM
treated stem cells (Figure 4D and 4E). KRN633 treatment
temporarily down-regulated p-Akt protein in the stem
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4F), while the
level of c-fos protein was not altered significantly (data
not shown).

by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and all 5-FU treated
cells showed low Bcl-2/BAX ratios due to induction of
apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Figure 5C).

Alteration of apoptosis and proliferation related
protein level in response to 5-FU
In this study, modulation of the activity of BAX, p21
(Cip1/Waf1), and c-fos upon exposure to 5-FU at 0.5, 1.0, and
5.0 mg/ml were evaluated. Proteins from untreated and 5-FC or
5-FU treated breast cancer cells were extracted in the presence
of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The data shown in
Figure 6 indicate that the BAX protein was increased in 5-FU
treated cancer cells from 30 min to 6 h (Figure 6A and 6B).
Although almost no change in the expression of c-fos protein
was observed, the expression level of the protein increased
slightly after 5-FU treatment for 30 m (Figure 6C). Finally,
we confirmed the expression of p21 (Cip1/Waf1) as a cyclindependent kinase inhibitor (Figure 6D). The 5-FU 1.0 mg/mltreated group showed the first expression of the p21 (Cip1/
Waf1) protein at 1 h after 5-FU treatment, while expression
was observed in the 0.5 mg/ml-treated group at 3 h after
treatment. Although this phenomenon lasted for six hours, p21
(Cip1/Waf1) protein was not observed in samples treated with
5.0 mg/ml 5-FU (Figure 6E).

Upregulation of BAX gene in response to 5-FU
treatment
To determine the mechanism underlying 5-FUinduced alteration of BAX and Bcl-2 genes, we
conducted RT-PCR analysis of breast cancer cells after
serial diluted 5-FU treatment (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/ml),
and total RNA was extracted at 3, 6, 9, and 24 h. The
results indicated that the apoptosis pathway was inhibited
by regulation of the expression of BAX and Bcl-2 genes
(Figure 5A). Specifically, these experiments showed
that expression of the BAX gene increased significantly
when treated with 5-FU of 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/ml, and
this persisted until 24 h (Figure 5B). The ratio of the
anti-apoptotic gene/pro-apoptotic gene was measured

in response to treatment with 1.0 or 5.0 mg/ml 5-FU,
respectively, and was sustained for 1 h.

Based on alteration of apoptosis and proliferation
associated protein following 5-FU treatment, we tested
whether expression of the transcriptional factors, p38
and p53, in MDA-MB-23l/Luc cells might inhibit cell
proliferation and reduce cell viability (Figure 7A). For
protein analysis, breast cancer cells were seeded in 6-well
plates, treated with serially diluted 5-FU (0.5, 1.0, and
5.0 mg/ml) and cultured for up to six hours. Protein
samples were collected at the indicated time points and
analyzed for upstream apoptosis or proliferation associated
protein. First, we investigated p53 expression upstream of
BAX and p21 (Cip1/Waf1) protein. We found that, when
compared with 5.0 mg/ml of 5-FC or 0.5 mg/ml of 5-FU,
expression of p53 was significantly higher in 1.0 mg/ml
or 5.0 mg/ml 5-FU treated breast cancer cells (Figure
7B). Additionally, phosphorylation of p38 as a regulatory
factor of p53 was activated after 5-FU treatment, and
this occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7C).
Expression of pp38 protein increased by 6- or 8.5-fold

Synergistic effect of 5-FU and IFN-β in MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells
In the next set of experiments, we investigated 5-FU
and IFN-β in drug combination studies. Through various
experiments, we determined the appropriate concentration
of 5-FU for co-treatment. Samples were then co-treated
with 5-FU 1.0 mg/ml and 500 Unit/ml IFN-β, after which
each protein was harvested and analyzed by western blot
analysis. BAX protein was strongly activated by IFN-β
treatment when compared to 5-FU anti-drug treated cells,
but a synergistic effect of cytokine and anti-cancer drug
was observed in the co-treatment group (Figure 8A and
8B). Additionally, treatment with 5-FU and IFN-β led to a
strong increase in p21 (Cip1/Waf1) expression relative to
untreated or single treated (5-FC, 5-FU, and IFN-β) cells
(Figure 8C and 8D). As expected, co-treatment with 5-FU
and IFN-β rapidly induced the expression of pro-apoptotic

protein or proliferation regulator in MDA-MB-231 cells.
In addition to the increase in BAX and p21 protein, we
investigated whether transcription factor p38 and p53
could be more phosphorylated in response to 5-FU and
IFN-β co-treatment (Figure 8E). In the case of p53, the
expression of protein increased in response to co-treatment
with 5-FU and IFN-β for 15 min relative to other treatment
cells (Figure 8F). We also performed immunoblot analysis
to evaluate the phosphorylation levels of p38 in cells
pretreated with 5-FU and IFN-β. After co-exposure for
30 min, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited higher induction of
p38 phosphorylation, as well as of the downstream growth
factor signaling molecules p53, BAX, and p21 than cells
treated with only 5-FU or IFN-β.

Luc cells. Upon therapeutic analysis, NSCs expression
of CD+/−IFN-β significantly inhibited growth of the
tumor burden, while the co-expressing stem cells treated
group showed a stronger reduction of tumor burden
than the group treated with CD expressing stem cells
alone. Although measurement of tumor burden using a
veterinary caliper revealed no significant difference, the
synergistically therapeutic effect of CD and IFN-β was
confirmed through bioluminescence imaging or analysis
of survival rate in the mouse model. Therapeutic gene
expressing stem cells treated mice showed a significant
decrease in bioluminescence signal intensity when
compared with control or parental stem cells treated mice.
Histopathological analysis also showed a trend toward
significance when compared with mice treated with single
therapeutic gene expressing stem cells. Necrosis zones of
cancer cells and apoptosis were more frequently observed
in HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β with 5-FC treated mice than in those
treated with HB1.F3.CD and 5-FC. These results also
indicated that modified NSCs have a strong therapeutic
potential for prolongation of life span.
The migration of NSCs toward breast cancer
cells was reported in previous studies [13, 31]. In a
mouse model of MDA-MB-435 cells induced metastatic
breast cancer, PKH26-posotive NSCs injected into the

contralateral region were found in the brain areas of the
tumor-bearing hemisphere [32]. In the present study, we
measured several chemoattractant factors secreted by
breast cancer cells, uPA, SDF-1a, VEGF, MCP-1, and
SCF. In our previous studies, parental NSCs and HB1.F3
cells were confirmed to contain several related-receptors
including uPA-related receptor (uPAR), VEGFR2, and
SCF-related receptor (c-Kit) [25]. Rosova et al. showed
that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured in hypoxia
increased their migration rates relative to normoxic
conditions [33]. Based on these results, we hypothesized
that VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling will affect the migratory
effects of NSCs via ligand-receptor response secreted by
cancer cells and stem cells, respectively. In the central

nervous system (CNS), VEGF stimulates the expansion
of NSCs and neurogenesis in various animal models,
resulting in improved learning ability [34]. Following
inhibition of VEGFR2 receptor expression in stem cells,
we observed tumor tropic effects of CM-DiI stained stem
cells by transwell assay. Although no changes in the levels
of VEGFR2 RNA were observed, several VEGF/VEGFR2
pathway-associated downstream transcriptional factors
showed altered protein expression, including Erk1/2 in
the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway and Akt in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
These results confirmed that a) phosphorylation of Erk1/2
increased, b) phosphorylation of Akt decreased, and then
increased.

of the MAPK pathway at a later time. Taken together,
although NSCs may sustain an undifferentiated state and
migratory ability through VEGF secreted by themselves,
stem cells may show greater migration to the site of injury
or tumor region due to excess VEGF secretion by damaged
cells or cancer cells. Even though the phenomenon of
tumor-tropic effects in stem cells is not clear, regulation
of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway may play a crucial
role in this process through interaction of chemoattractant
factors and their receptors. In our previous study, tumor
cells modulate Erk1/2 and Akt signaling and migration of
stem cells by secreting VEGF [38]. This further increased
tumor-selectivity of stem cell/prodrug co-therapy. Overall,
these results indicate that NSCs expressing the therapeutic
gene may be a powerful tool for treatment of primary lung
cancer or metastasis of lung cancer to the brain.
To investigate whether BAX, p21 (Cip1/Waf1),
c-fos, p38, and p53 proteins are activated after treatment
with 5-FU in the absence or presence of IFN-β, we
incubated MDA-MB-231 cells under each condition with
different concentrations of 5-FU (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/ml).
The typical apoptosis and proliferation markers, BAX and
p21 (Cip1/Waf1) expression, were observed in 5-FU+/−

In a previous study, application of SDF-1a as a
chemoattractant of factor to induce tumor tropism of stem
cells increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in a primary
subventricular zone (SVZ) culture [35]. However,
expression of p-Erk1/2 was induced following treatment
with VEGFR2 inhibitor in our study. Phosphorylation of
Erk1/2 is related to stimulation of stem cells differentiation
as well as migratory ability [36]. Therefore, it is likely
that inhibition of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling facilitated
the differentiation of NSCs in the present study. Our
data also showed that protein analysis of the stem cells
in media containing KRN633 temporarily decreased
phosphorylation of Akt. Under hypoxia, expression of
Akt protein was likely an important factor in improved
survival and retention of cells in damaged tissues and
faster functional improvement [33]. Therefore, we
suggested that PI3K/Akt signaling might be reduced when
the amount of VEGF is insufficient. In another study,
stress status of NSCs appears to be required to maintain
their self-renewal via negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway and neurogenesis by maintaining adequate levels
of PI3K signaling [37]. Treatment with VEGFR2 inhibitor
can promote increased Akt phosphorylation via activation

IFN-β treated groups. The response to drugs occurred
rapidly after 5-FU and IFN-β co-treatment relative to other
groups. Apoptosis is triggered by the imbalance between
pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2
family, which determines the mitochondrial response to
apoptosis stimuli [39]. We found a decrease in the ratio
of the Bcl-2/BAX gene after 5-FU treatment, suggesting
the activation of pro-apoptosis function of 5-FU leading
to cell death. Although the Bcl-2/BAX ratio for induction
of apoptosis showed the greatest decrease in response
to 0.5 mg/ml of 5-FU, we selected the concentration of
1.0 mg/ml 5-FU following western blot analysis for cotreatment with human IFN-β in breast cancer cells. In
this investigation, 5-FU and IFN-β stimulated BAX
overexpression for apoptosis in breast cancer cells via
synergistic effects. Similarly, p21 (Cip1/Waf1) expression
was significantly increased in the 5-FU/IFN-β co-treated
group relative to the 5-FU or IFN-β treatment only. We
then investigated the upstream consequences of these

effects by evaluating modulation of critical signaling
cascades linked to BAX and p21 mediated pathways.
Modulation of the activity of two critical signaling factors,
p53 and p38, was evaluated upon exposure to 5-FU+/−
IFN-β. p53 and p38 were phosphorylated in 5-FU+/−
IFN-β treated breast cancer cells, and combined inhibition
of 5-FU with IFN-β demonstrated synergy against these
cells. These data provided a mechanistic rationale for
investigation of whether NSCs expressing CD.IFN-β
showed a synergistic effect through activation of p53 and
p38 protein. In a further study, immune response of human
IFN-β should be proved to analyze the exact mechanism
of its synergistic effect, because IFN-β is a strong cytokine
which can induce anti-viral and anti-cancer effects [40].
In conclusion, these results in this study demonstrate
the potential for use of NSCs as an effective delivery
system in the presence of a prodrug to target metastasis
of brain tumor via the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway. Coexpression of CD with the IFN-β gene induced apoptosis

and suppressed cell proliferation via modulation of key
signaling molecules such as p53 and p38. These findings
suggest the possibility of developing new stem-cell based
therapy for treating metastatic breast cancer.

Control mice were injected with vehicle (8 ml PBS).
After injection of stem cells and vehicle, 5-FC (500
mg/kg/day; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA)
was administrated via an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
(once a day, 5 days per week for 2 weeks). All mice were
observed until the end point of the animal experiment, at
which point the survival rate of stem cells treated mice
was determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231/
Luc, which stably expresses firefly luciferase as a
bioluminescent reporter gene, was purchased from KOMA
biotechnology (Seoul, Korea). These cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM; Hyclone
Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with
10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone Laboratory Inc.), 100 Unit/ml penicillin, 100 mg/
ml streptomycin (Cellgro Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA,
USA), and 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human
NSCs, HB1.F3, HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β
were obtained from Chungang University (Seoul, Korea)
and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 Unit/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 10 mM
HEPES and 0.1% antimycoplasmal agents (Invivogen,
San Diego, CA, USA) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere. All cell lines were passaged using 0.05%
trypsin/0.02% EDTA (Gibco).

Bioluminescence imaging
Mice in both groups were imaged weekly using
an IVIS™ Spectrum Scanner (Xenogen; Caliper Life
Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA) containing a chargecoupled (CCD) camera with photon emitting properties.
Briefly, 150 mg/kg of luciferase substrate D-luciferin
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in dissolved solution was
injected i.p. into each mouse at 10 min prior to imaging,
after which they were anesthetized with 1–3% isoflurane.
The minutes later, bioluminescent tumor cells were
detected by a CCD camera mounted in a light-tight box
and tumor regions were quantified using a total photon
counter (photon/s). Living Image controlled imaging
analysis software (Caliper Life Sciences, Waltham, MA,
USA). Regions-of-interest (ROI) of the same size and
shape were used for all mice throughout the study.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H & E staining)
Paraffin-fixed brains from control and NSCs treated
mice were used to conduct histopathological analysis. The
tumor tissues were collected after sacrificing the mice
and then fixed in 10% normal formalin (Sigma-Aldrich
Co.), embedded in paraffin blocks and cut with a sliding
microtome (3 mm sections). After deparaffination and
rehydration, the slides were stained using hematoxylin
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.).
To prevent sample contamination, stained slides were
hydrated and mounted using mounting solution. The size
and location of the tumor mass in the brain was observed
by light microscopy using a BX51 microscope (Olympus,
Japan).

Xenograft and therapeutic effect of GESTECs
All animal experiments were approved by
the Animal Care Committee of Chungbuk National
University. Six weeks old female nude mice purchased
from Central Laboratory Animal (Seoul, Korea)
were housed in a pathogen free environment under a
12 h light/dark schedule with frequent ventilation.
During the experiment, mice were provided with an
autoclaved rodent diet (Central Lab. Animal Inc.) and
water ad libitum. To establish metastatic breast cancer
models in mice, MDA-MB-231/Luc cells (1 × 105
cells/mice) were suspended in 8 ml of 1 × phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and directly implanted into
the white matter of the right hemisphere [anterior/
posterior (AP) +1.0 mm, medial/lateral (ML) +1.7
mm, dorsal/ventral (DV) −3.2 mm]. Two weeks later,
32 mice were randomly divided into four groups (each
n = 8); 1) a negative control, 2) HB1.F3 cell treated
group in the presence of 5-FC, 3) HB1.F3.CD cell
treated group in the presence of 5-FC, 4) HB1.F3.CD.
IFN-β cell treated group in the presence of 5-FC. The
mice were injected into the left hemisphere with the
stem cells (1 × 105 cells/mice), HB1.F3, HB1.F3.CD,
or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells, pre-stained with 2 mM
of
chloromethylbenzamide-1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (CM-DiI;
Invitrogen Life Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Paraffin embedded brain sections were subjected
to IHC staining. Antigen retrieval of brain slides was
performed by microwave for 10 min in a chamber
containing citrate buffer (0.01 M; pH 6.0). Following
antigen retrieval, tissue slides were placed in 0.3%
methanol/hydrogen peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for
30 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase. To block the
non-specific binding of antibodies, this slide was incubated
with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 h. Subsequently, the slides
were incubated overnight with a mixture of anti-PCNA
(1:100, Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK) primary antibody

in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in a
humidified chamber. The next day, the slides were washed
three times in 1 × PBS-T (pH 7.4) and then incubated with
appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector
Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Slides
were subsequently rinsed with PBS-T for 10 min, after
which Vectastain Universal Elite ABC kit reagent (Vector
Laboratories) was applied for 30 min. Immunoreactive
complexes were detected using DAB substrate (SigmaAldrich Co.) and counted after staining with hematoxylin.
Finally, slides were mounted with a cover slip using
mounting medium. All slides were visualized under a
BX51 light microscope for digital photography.

Bio.) as a reference dye, and sense and antisense primers
(Bioneer). PCR was conducted to detect chemoattractant
factor genes including urokinase-type plasminogen
activator (uPA), SDF-1a, VEGF, monocyte chemotactic
protein 1 (MCP-1), and stem cell factor (SCF). The PCR
program consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C
for 15 s, annealing at 58°C for 20 s, and extension at 72°C
for 15 s, and all analyses were carried out in triplicate for
each sample. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was used for normalization. The mRNA levels
of these genes were determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method
and the specific primer sets listed in Table 1.
To analyze the mRNA levels of VEGFR2 or
BAX/Bcl-2 genes in the MDA-BD-231 cells following
KRN633 or 5-FU (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) treatment, PCR
was performed using cDNA template, Taq polymerase
(iNtRON Biotechnology), dNTP, 10 × PCR buffer
(iNtRON Biotechnology), and specific primer sets
(Bioneer). The PCR program consisted of 30 cycles
of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 58°C
for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. PCR products
were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide (EtBr; Sigma-Aldrich Co.)
and analyzed using Gel Doc 2000 (BioRad Laboratories
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). GAPDH was used as an
endogenous control for normalization.

Transwell assay
To investigate the effects of VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling pathway on the migration of GESTECs,
we performed an in vitro cell migration assay using a
24-well transwell with a pore size of 8 mm (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). MDA-MD-231/Luc cells
(1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in the lower chamber of
the transwell and fibronectin was applied to the transwell
to induce the adhesion of migrated GESTECs. To inhibit
VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling, stem cells was exposed to
KRN633 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) diluted
media before being seeded in the transwell. Briefly, after
starvation in serum free media, 100 µM KRN633 was
applied to each stem cell for 1 h. The CM-DiI pre-stained
GESTECs (1 × 105 cells/well) were then seeded in the
upper chamber of transwell after treatment with KRN633.
The chamber was subsequently incubated at 37°C for
24 h. After incubation, the non-migrated cells were scraped
with a plastic blade and then fixed in cold methanol. The
upper chambers of transwell were washed with PBS and
stained with 200 ng/ml 4′, 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Finally, migrated cells were
examined with an Olympus microscope (IX71 Inverted
Microscope, Olympus, Japan) connected to a fluorescence
detector.

Western blot
Following 5-FU and/or IFN-β treatment of breast
cancer cells and KRN633 treatment of stem cells, whole
cell lysates were extracted from the cancer and stem
cells. Briefly, samples were placed in protein extraction
solution (1 x RIPA solution; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150
mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate) with protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany), incubated overnight at 4°C, and then
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The concentration of
the protein was then determined using bicinchoninic acid
(BCA; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and copper (II) sulfate (SigmaAldrich Co.) mixture. Next, 40 µg of whole cell lysate was
resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE), after which fractionated proteins were
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transfer
membrane (BioRad Laboratories Inc.). The membrane
was subsequently blocked with 5% skim milk (BioRad
Laboratories Inc.) blocking buffer to inhibit the nonspecific interaction with primary antibody for 2 h and
then washed four times in 1 x TBS buffer (adjusted to pH
7.6 with HCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (BioRad
Laboratories Inc.). Next, the membrane was incubated
with primary antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-p21 (Cip1/
Waf1) (1:1,000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
Danvers, MA, USA), anti-p53 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA), anti-BAX

Real-time and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
Total RNA of breast cancer cells and stem cells
was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) RNA extraction solution according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. Reverse transcription
reaction was performed using 1 mg total RNA with
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLVRT; iNtRON Biotechnology, Sungnam, Kyeonggido,
Korea), 10 pM dNTP (Bioneer, Deajeon, Korea), nonamer
random primer (TaKaRa Bio., Shiga, Japan), 5 × RT buffer
(iNtRON Biotechnology) and RNase inhibitor (iNtRON
Biotechnology).
The real time PCR mixture was composed of

5-FU and IFN-β treatment
For analysis of 5-FU effects in stem cell therapy,
cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of
5-FU (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/ml), after which proteins were
harvested at 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h
following 5-FU treatment. To measure the expression of
the apoptotic genes BAX and Bcl-2, MDA-MB-231 cells
were exposed to 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/ml of 5-FU for 3,
6, 9, and 24 h. To investigate the synergistic effects of
5-FU and IFN-β (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ,
USA), we co-treated samples with 1.0 mg/ml of 5-FU and
500 Unit/ml of human IFN-β in cultured MDA-MD-231
cells. Finally, whole protein was extracted using protein
extraction solution.
