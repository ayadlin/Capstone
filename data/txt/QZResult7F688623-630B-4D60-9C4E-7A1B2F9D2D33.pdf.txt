ABSTRACT
Carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII) is a membrane enzyme that maintains pH
homeostasis and sustains optimum P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux activity in cancer
cells. Here, we investigated a panel of eight CAXII inhibitors (compounds 1–8),
for their potential to reverse Pgp mediated tumor cell chemoresistance. Inhibitors
(5 nM) were screened in human and murine cancer cells (colon, lung, breast, bone)
with different expression levels of CAXII and Pgp. We identified three CAXII inhibitors
(compounds 1, 2 and 4) that significantly (≥ 2 fold) increased the intracellular
retention of the Pgp-substrate and chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, and restored its
cytotoxic activity. The inhibitors lowered intracellular pH to indirectly impair Pgp
activity. Ca12-knockout assays confirmed that the chemosensitizing property of the
compounds was dependent on active CAXII. Furthermore, in a preclinical model of
drug-resistant breast tumors compound 1 (1900 ng/kg) restored the efficacy of
doxorubicin to the same extent as the direct Pgp inhibitor tariquidar. The expression
of carbonic anhydrase IX had no effect on the intracellular doxorubicin accumulation.
Our work provides strong evidence that CAXII inhibitors are effective chemosensitizer
agents in CAXII-positive and Pgp-positive cancer cells. The use of CAXII inhibitors
may represent a turning point in combinatorial chemotherapeutic schemes to treat
multidrug-resistant tumors.

INTRODUCTION

cells CAXII contributes to extracellular acidification while
also maintaining a normal intracellular pH (pHi). CAXII
hydrates tumor cell generating CO2. As a consequence H+
ions are trapped extracellularly, lowering pH outside the
cell (pHo), while HCO3- is taken up by the cell to buffer the
intracellular pH (pHi). [11, 12]. In healthy tissues CAXII
is expressed mainly in the kidney and large intestine,
with minimal expression in other tissues. The acid-base
equilibrium regulated by CAXII is associated with Na+ and
Cl− transport that in turn drives passive water absorption in
these organs [2, 13].
The inhibition of CAXII has been associated
with impaired tumor growth, with a CAXII-inhibitory
monoclonal antibody showing significant antitumor
properties in mouse xenografts of breast cancer [14].
There is no corresponding study to correlate effects of

Carbonic anhydrases (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) are highly
conserved and ubiquitous zinc metalloenzymes that
reversibly hydrate carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and a
proton: CO2 + H2O D HCO3− + H+, controlling intracellular
pH (pHi) [1]. CAIX and CAXII, two integral membrane
proteins with the catalytic domain on the extracellular side,
are overexpressed in many solid and hypoxic tumors [2–5].
Given the expression prevalence of CAXII in transformed
cells, high levels of tissue-associated and circulating
CAXII have been proposed as predictive markers of
thyroid [6] and squamous lung [7] cancers, respectively.
CAXII overexpression has also been associated with poor
prognosis in human gliomas [8], oral squamous cancer
[9] and esophageal squamous cell cancer [10]. In cancer

small molecule CAXII inhibition with CAXII expression
in tumors, however CAXII inhibitors have demonstrated
antimetastatic activity in a breast cancer xenograft [15].
We recently demonstrated that CAXII is
overexpressed in chemoresistant cancer cells expressing
the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) [16]. Pgp
recognizes multiple substrates, including a broad range
of chemotherapeutics. Pgp expression in cancer cells
contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) [17, 18]. CAXII
physically interacts with Pgp and it has been proposed that
CAXII maintains the optimal pH for Pgp efflux activity,
thus potentiating the contribution of Pgp to MDR [13].
Given the correlation of CAXII activity with tumor
proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance, the interest
in developing selective inhibitors of CAXII has increased
in recent years, however in vitro and in vivo studies with
small molecule CAXII inhibitors that directly link the
mechanism of action to CAXII inhibition remain scarce
and CAXII is much less studied than the other cancerassociated CA, CAIX.
The aim of this study is to evaluate CAXII
inhibitors as selective chemosensitizers in MDR tumor
models. Eight test inhibitors with variable CA inhibition
profiles and variable physicochemical properties were
selected to establish the potential of CAXII inhibitors to
indirectly inhibit Pgp activity to resensitize MDR cells
to doxorubicin. We show that CAXII inhibitors have
very good chemosensitizing efficacy, and increase the
effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin
up to 4.4-fold. This correlated with high expression of
both CAXII and Pgp in vitro and in vivo. Our results
demonstrate that small molecule CAXII inhibitors may
have future applications in clinical settings, for example,
by allowing a reduction in the dosage of cytotoxic drugs
or To restore the cytotoxic efficacy of existing drugs that
have lost their effectiveness i.e. resensitizing of hard-totreat tumors to chemotherapeutics.

such as HT29, A549, MCF7, SKBR3, T74D, U2OS and
SaOS cells (Figure 2A–2J). The expression of CAIX
did not influence the effects of the compounds on the
intracellular doxorubicin accumulation in all cell lines
tested. Compound 3 (CAXII Ki = 96 nM) has low activity
as a CAXII inhibitor, however was included in the
study as it is a prodrug of compound 2, an active CAXII
inhibitor (CAXII Ki = 7.3 nM). Consequently compounds
2 and 3 provide a ‘drug/prodrug’ pair where the observed
activity of the ‘drug’ may be predominantly attributed
to 2. Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were the most consistently
effective at increasing the intracellular accumulation of
doxorubicin across all CAXII-positive and Pgp-positive
cell lines tested, showing the same potency as the
direct Pgp inhibitor, tariquidar (Figure 2A–2J). The
compounds also increased the intracellular retention
of the chemotherapeutics vinblastine (Supplementary
Figure S2A) and paclitaxel (Supplementary Figure S2B),
two Pgp substrates with different Pgp binding sites [19].
Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were selected for the follow-up
assays, described next.
In accordance with the correlation of CAXII
expression and cancer cell proliferation [14], compounds
1, 2 and 4 reduced the viability of CAXII-positive cell
lines. The reduction in viability for individual compounds
was: ≤ 31 ± 6% in HT29/DX cells, ≤ 28 ± 10% in A549
cells, ≤ 38 ± 7% in A549/DX cells, ≤ 33 ± 12% in T74D
cells, ≤ 36 ± 11% in MDA-MB-231 cells, ≤ 28 ± 7% in
TUBO cells, ≤ 30 ± 10% in JC cells, ≤ 27 ± 8% in U2OS/
DX cells, ≤ 32 ± 7% in SaOS/DX cells (p < 0.05 for all
cell lines; n = 4). In contrast, the compounds were devoid
of any effects on viability in cells with low or undetectable
levels of CAXII, including HT29, MCF7, SKBR3, U2OS,
SaOS cell lines (not shown). As expected, doxorubicin
reduced viability in cells with undetectable or low levels
of Pgp, i.e. HT29, A549, MCF7, SKBR3, T74D, U2OS
and SaOS cells; in these doxorubicin-sensitive cell lines
the compounds did not exert additive effects on viability
compared to doxorubicin treatment alone (not shown). In
contrast, HT29/DX, A549/DX, MDA-MB-231, TUBO,
JC, U2OS/DX, SaOS/DX cells, which are positive
for both Pgp and CAXII (Supplementary Figure S1),
were unresponsive to doxorubicin alone not shown.
Compounds 1, 2 and 4 restored doxorubicin efficacy
and further reduced cell viability. The differences in cell
viability between cells treated with compounds alone and
cells co-treated with compounds plus doxorubicin were:
≥ 38 ± 6% in HT29/DX cells, ≥ 22 ± 8% in A549 cells,
≥ 38 ± 7% in A549/DX cells, ≥ 18 ± 7% in T74D cells,
≥ 34 ± 10% in MDA-MB-231 cells, ≥ 22 ± 8% in TUBO
cells, ≥ 29 ± 8% in JC cells, ≥ 27 ± 9% in U2OS/DX
cells, ≥ 27 ± 7% in SaOS/DX cells, (p < 0.05; n = 4).
These differences suggest that the decreased viability of
cells co-treated with CAXII inhibitors and doxorubicin
was due to the increased doxorubicin accumulation with
added compound 1, 2 or 4 and/or to a synergistic effect
of compound 1, 2 or 4 and doxorubicin, rather than to

RESULTS
Selective CAXII inhibitors increase doxorubicin
accumulation and cytotoxicity in CAXII-positive
and Pgp-positive cancer cells
The CA inhibition, CAXII selectivity and cLog
P values for inhibitors 1–8 (Figure 1) are given in Table 1.
On the basis of the Ki values for 1, 2 and 4–8 at
CAXII (Ki < 10 nM), all the compounds were evaluated
at 5 nM concentrations in the following in vitro assays.
In these experimental conditions, compounds 1, 2 and
4 increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin,
a Pgp substrate, in cells with high expression of both
CAXII and Pgp (Supplementary Figure S1), such as
HT29/DX, A549/DX, MDA-MB-231, TUBO, JC, U2OS/
DX and SaOS/DX cells (Figure 2A–2J). The compounds
had no effect on cells with detectable levels of just one of
these two proteins expressed (Supplementary Figure S1),

cytotoxicity exerted by the CAXII inhibitors themselves.
Accordingly, the doxorubicin IC50 was significantly
reduced by the co-treatment with the CAXII inhibitors in
these cell lines. Co-treatment with compounds 1, 2 and 4
had the same efficacy as treatment with tariquidar (Figure
3A–3J) in resensitizing cells to doxorubicin (Table 2).
Notably, in CAXII-negative MCF7 and SKBR3 cells
that overexpress Pgp (Supplementary Figure S3A), the
compounds did not increase the intracellular retention
of doxorubicin (Supplementary Figure S3B). Lastly,
compounds 1, 2 and 4 did not exert any cytotoxic

effect (Supplementary Figure S4B) in not-transformed
human epithelial colon CCD-Co-18 cells, epithelial
lung BEAS-2B cells, epithelial breast MCF10A cells
or fibroblasts that do not have detectable levels of
CAXII (Supplementary Figure S4A). Collectively
these results demonstrate that compounds 1, 2 and 4 are
cytotoxic agents against CAXII-positive cancer cells and
substantially reverse doxorubicin resistance in cancer
cells expressing both CAXII and Pgp, but are without
significant cytotoxicity in CAXII-negative and nottransformed cells.

Cells were incubated for 72 h with increasing concentrations (1 nM–1 mM) of doxorubicin (dox), alone or in the presence of
5 nM of compound 1, 2 and 4, then stained in quadruplicate with neutral red. Tariquidar (25 nM, for 24 h; Tar) was included
as Pgp inhibitor (n = 4). Rf (resistance factor) was calculated as the ratio between mean IC50 in cells treated with compound
1, 2 and 4, and mean IC50 in cells treated with doxorubicin and tarquidar.

Selective CAXII inhibitors lower Pgp ATPase
activity and alter intracellular pH

activity by co-treatment of tariquidar with compounds 1, 2
and 4 (Supplementary Figure S7).

CAXII and Pgp proteins co-immunoprecipitated
(Figure 4A) in HT29/DX, A549/DX, MDA-MB-231,
TUBO, JC, U2OS/DX and SaOS/DX cells, which express
both CAXII and Pgp (Supplementary Figure S1), as well
as in Pgp-enriched vesicles derived from the membranes of
these cells (Supplementary Figure S5), indicating that these
two enzymes were physically associated in the cell plasma
membrane. Treatment of these doxorubicin-resistant cell
lines with CAXII inhibitors 1, 2 and 4 (5 nM) lowered the
pHi relative to untreated cells: compound 1 (CAXII Ki =
1.0 nM) reduced pHi ≥ 0.24 units, compound 2 (CAXII =
Ki 7.3 nM) reduced pHi ≥ 0.12 units, compound 4 (CAXII
= Ki 7.6 nM) reduced pHi ≥ 0.06 units (Supplementary
Figure S6). Isolated Pgp has consistent basal activity
across the pH range 6.2 to 7.6 (at 37 °C) [16], this range
encompasses the pHi of the resistant cancer cell lines tested
(Supplementary Figure S6). Notably, the reduction of pHi
exerted by compounds 1, 2 and 4 (Supplementary Figure
S6) was paralleled by a modest, but significant reduction
(≥ 1.47-fold) of Pgp ATPase activity (Figure 4B).
The compounds also reduced the substrate-dependent
activation of Pgp, as demonstrated by the ATPase assays
performed in the presence of Pgp substrate doxorubicin
(Supplementary Figure S7). In contrast, in the presence
of the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar, which strongly decreased
ATPase activity, there was no further reduction of ATPase

Knockout of ca12 abrogates the effects of CAXII
inhibitors on doxorubicin accumulation and
cytotoxicity

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To confirm that the chemosensitizing effect of
compounds 1, 2 and 4 was dependent on CAXII activity,
we knocked-out ca12 in a selection of the CAXII-positive
and Pgp-positive cell lines: HT29/DX, A549/DX, MDAMB-231 and U2OS/DX cells (Figure 5A). Compounds 1,
2 and 4 lost the ability to further increase the doxorubicin
intracellular accumulation (Figure 5B) in ca12 knockedout (KO) cells, to resensitize the cell lines to doxorubicininduced cytotoxicity (Figure 5C) and to inhibit Pgp
activity (Supplementary Figure S8). These results are
consistent with the attribution of the effect of compounds
1, 2 and 4 as being dependent on the modulation of CAXII
activity. Ca12 KO cells had lower pHi (Figure 6A) and
lower Pgp activity (Figure 6B) than wild-type cells. The
addition of the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin (10 µM)
increased the pHi of ca12 KO cells (Figure 6A) and the
Pgp activity (Figure 6B) to values comparable with wildtype cells. Distinct from wild-type cells, doxorubicin
did not increase the activity of Pgp in ca12 KO cells
(Supplementary Figure S8), suggesting that the absence
of CAXII hampered the substrate-dependent activation of
Pgp. In contrast, tariquidar inhibited Pgp activity in both

wild-type and ca12 KO cells (Supplementary Figure S8).
These findings suggest that the absence or presence of
CAXII does not influence the efficacy of tariquidar.

We used the highly chemoresistant JC breast tumor
model, which is refractory to doxorubicin (Figure 7A–7B).
To maximize the drug delivery to the tumor, we injected
compound 1 intratumorally, at 10 nM (19 ng/kg) and
1 μM (1900 ng/kg). The lower concentration falls in the
range of the CAXII in vitro inhibition of compound 1 (Ki =
1.0 nM); the higher concentration was selected to mitigate
compound 1 clearance through lymphatic and blood
vessels. Compound 1 has low mouse plasma stability
(t1/2 = 0.7 h) but good mouse liver microsome stability
(t1/2 = 134.8 min). At both dosages compound 1 had no
effect on tumor growth when used alone, but when co-

CAXII inhibition reduces the growth of
doxorubicin-resistant tumors in vivo
To test the efficacy of CAXII inhibition in
preclinical models of breast resistant tumors, we focused
our attention on compound 1, as it had achieved the
most striking effect in terms of CAXII inhibition and
doxorubicin-chemosensitizing effects in vitro.

anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin with 21% and 47%
reduction in tumor volume at day 18, when used at 19 ng/
kg and 1900 ng/kg, respectively (Figure 7A–7B). At 1900
ng/kg compound 1 produced tumor reduction similar
to tariquidar (Figure 7A–7B). Worthy of note, at both
dosages compound 1 did not induce liver, kidney or heart
toxicity, according to the hematochemical parameters
of the animals at the time of sacrifice (Supplementary
Table S1). As expected, doxorubicin increased creatine
phosphokinase (CPK) level, an index of cardiac damage,

but compound 1 did not further increase this parameter in
doxorubicin-treated animals (Supplementary Table S1).

DISCUSSION
In this work, we assessed a panel of CAXII
inhibitors for their capacity to reverse doxorubicin
resistance in MDR cancer cells that overexpress Pgp and
resensitize cells to doxorubicin.
Our group has previously designed and synthesized
carbohydrate-based CA inhibitors to preferentially inhibit

cancer-associated CA isozymes (CAIX and CAXII)
over intracellular CAs [12, 20, 21]. The combination of
enzyme inhibition and physicochemical properties of the
inhibitors was optimized to reduce passive membrane
diffusion and favour selective inhibition of extracellular
CAs over intracellular CAs. For this study a panel of eight
compounds, 1–8, were selected. The cLog P value of a
compound is indicative of passive membrane permeability,
with cLog P values < 0 expected to give compounds with
minimal passive cell membrane permeability. Compounds
with strong CAXII inhibition, with CAXII selectivity,
and with cLog P values < 0 are thus predicted to inhibit
extracellular CA enzymes over intracellular CA enzymes
and perform best in the cell-based models. The selection of
compounds for this study was guided by these parameters.
Compounds 1, 2 and 4–8 all have Ki < 10 nM
for CAXII. These compounds also incorporate a polar
monosaccharide or disaccharide moiety such that cLog
P values are in the range −3.17 to −4.94. Compound 3
(cLog P + 1.40) is an acyl ester prodrug of compound 2,
unlike 2 it is expected that 3 will enter cells by passive
membrane diffusion and then be converted to 2 by
intracellular esterases. Consequently compounds 2 and 3
provide a ‘drug/prodrug’ pair where the observed activity
of the ‘drug’ may be attributed to extracellular (2) and
intracellular (3) localization of the inhibitor, respectively.

Compounds 1, 2 and 4 increased doxorubicin
accumulation and efficacy in cancer cells that co-express
CAXII and Pgp, with the same efficacy of tariquidar, one
of the strongest third-generation Pgp inhibitors known
[22], used in phase I and phase II clinical trials (https://
clinicaltrials.gov). The compounds also increased the
intracellular accumulation of vinblastine and paclitaxel,
Pgp substrates with alternate Pgp binding sites to
doxorubicin [19]. This suggests that the CAXII inhibitors
reduce Pgp activity, in a non-Pgp substrate specific manner.
Additionally, doxorubicin and vinblastine are weakly
basic drugs with increased protonation at acidic pH, while
paclitaxel is a non-ionizable drug that remains neutral
at acidic pH, hence the resensitizing effect of CAXII
inhibitors is not limited to protonatable Pgp substrates.
Furthermore, this effect was observed in tumor cells of
different histological origins and species, suggesting that
the compounds activity is independent of tumor type,
species type or Pgp substrate type, requiring only a CAXII
positive and Pgp positive phenotype. This phenotype may
identify chemoresistant tumors that represent the best
candidates for the co-treatment of Pgp substrate cancer
chemotherapeutics with CAXII inhibitors. Since CAXII
is usually poorly expressed in most healthy cells [5], the
use of CAXII inhibitors, may provide a selective tumortargeting approach when administered with standard

female BALB/c mice were inoculated s.c. with 1 × 106 JC cells. When the tumor reached the volume of 100 mm3 (day 7), the mice were
randomized into 8 groups (10 animals/group) and treated on days 0, 6 and 12 after the randomization as it follows: 1) control group, treated
with 0.1 ml saline solution intravenously (i.v.); 2) doxorubicin group, treated with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v.; 3) tariquidar group, treated
with 5 mg/kg tariquidar per os; 4) C1 19 group, treated with 19 ng/kg compound 1 (in 0.1 ml saline solution; final concentration: 10 nM)
intratumorally; 5) C1 1900 group, treated with 1900 ng/kg compound 1 (in 0.1 ml saline solution; final concentration: 1 µM) intratumorally;
6) doxorubicin + tariquidar group, treated with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v. and 5 mg/kg tariquidar per os; 7) doxorubicin + C1 19 group,
treated with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v. and 19 ng/kg compound 1 intratumorally; 8) doxorubicin + C1 1900 group, treated with 5 mg/kg

chemotherapeutic drugs to patients with drug resistant
tumors. Indeed, our compounds were not cytotoxic in
epithelial and fibroblasts cells, that had undetectable levels
of CAXII. The lack of efficacy of compounds 1, 2 and 4
in ca12 KO cancer cells further demonstrated that CAXII
inhibition is the critical mechanism of action in reversing
doxorubicin resistance. Similarly, the lack of efficacy of
the compounds in CAXII-negative cells overexpressing
Pgp suggests that the increased doxorubicin retention is
not due to a direct inhibition of Pgp, but it is a consequence
of CAXII inhibition.
CAIX has been correlated with an aggressive tumor
phenotype [5, 11] and resistance against doxorubicin
in breast cancer tumors [23]. However, in our in vitro
screening the efficacy of compounds 1, 2 and 4 in
increasing doxorubicin accumulation and cytotoxicity was
independent of the expression of CAIX. These findings
correlate with previous data that demonstrated silencing
of CAIX in doxorubicin-resistant cells did not impact on
drug-resistance, while silencing of CAXII reversed the
drug-resistant phenotype [16].
CAXII is critical for maintaining normal pHi in
cancer cells [1, 11]. We hypothesize that the inhibition
of CAXII alters the membrane microenvironment where
Pgp works, impairing the optimal conditions for its
function as an efflux pump. Chemoresistant cells have a
slightly alkaline pHi that contributes to the maintenance
of their drug-resistant phenotype [24]. Isolated Pgp has
consistent basal activity across the pH range 6.2 to 7.6
(at 37°C) [25], which is compatible with the pHi of the
doxorubicin-resistant cells analyzed (ranging from 7.45 to
7.64 pH units). We previously reported that the treatment
with the classical CAXII inhibitor acetazolamide
(AZA), as well as CAXII silencing, lowered the pHi of
doxorubicin-resistant colon cancer cells and reduced
Pgp activity [16]. Compounds 1, 2 and 4 decreased pHi
(1 by 0.24 units, 2 by 0.12 units, and 4 by 0.06 units).
Similarly ca12 KO cells had lower pHi than wild-type
cells. This decrease was paralleled by a reduction in Pgp
ATPase activity. Of note, when pHi in ca12 KO cells was
increased to the same pH value of wild-type cells with
monensin, Pgp activity also increased. These results
suggest that the increased pHi maintained by CAXII in
resistant cells is critical to maintain optimal Pgp activity.
The lower pHi produced by CAXII inhibition reduces Pgp
activity, resulting in increased intracellular retention of
doxorubicin, vinblastine and paclitaxel. Although we did
not measure the pH within the lipid microenvironment
where Pgp and CAXII operate in close proximity, we may
infer that the inhibition of CAXII reduced the pH in the
plasma membrane microenvironment even more than in
whole cell, markedly decreasing Pgp activity. Notably,
compounds 1, 2 and 4 are all expected to have low cell
membrane passive diffusion and thus inhibit CAXII.
By contrast, compound 3, a lipophilic ester ‘prodrug’ of
2 and expected to yield compound 2 in the intracellular
environment following esterase processing, was devoid of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

efficacy. These data further suggest that it is inhibition of
extracellular facing CAXII (and not intracellular CAs) that
may be attributed to the reversal of drug resistance.
Compared with the classical CAXII inhibitor AZA,
compounds 1, 2 and 4 offer the advantage of higher
selectivity toward CAXII, lower Ki values and reduced
lipophilicity. These attributes render them promising
candidates to be tested in vivo, using the Pgp-positive
and doxorubicin-resistant JC model [26, 27]. We selected
compound 1 for an in vivo study as this compound had the
maximal chemosensitizing effect in vitro.
To avoid compound related metabolism or
clearance and maximise tumor delivery, we administered
1 intratumorally. Either a dosage of 1 around the
CAXII Ki or a 100-fold higher dosage, to counteract
compound clearance through lymphatic and blood
vessels, significantly reduced tumor growth when coadministered with doxorubicin. Since the compound
alone (i.e. without co-administration of doxorubicin) did
not reduce tumor growth, such effect was likely due to
the increased retention of doxorubicin within cancer cells.
These data suggest that compound 1 effectively reverses
the resistance to doxorubicin in vivo to resensitize these
resistant cells to doxorubicin treatment. The sensitization
efficacy was comparable to the third-generation Pgp
inhibitor tariquidar. Moreover, compound 1, either alone
or with doxorubicin, did not elicit liver or kidney toxicity,
or increase the cardiac damage induced by doxorubicin
(an anthracycline), according to the hematochemical
parameters of the animals. We propose that the indirect
mechanism of action of CAXII inhibitors to reduce Pgp
activity voids the usual in vivo toxicity associated with
direct Pgp inhibition. Additionally, as CA inhibitors have
been a mainstay of human clinical intervention for several
decades (more than 25 clinically approved CA inhibitors)
this drug class has a recorded safety profile [28]. Moreover,
mammalian CAs belong to the α-CA family, with murine
CAXII expressed in the large intestine and kidney
similarly to human CAXII [29, 30]. Given the significant
chemosensitizing effect of compound 1, we speculate
that the dosage of doxorubicin- if co-administered with
compound 1 (or other selective small molecule CAXII
inhibitors) -may even be reduced while retaining its
antitumor efficacy yet limiting doxorubicin associated
cardiotoxicity.
In summary, our work suggests that CAXII
inhibitors are potent chemosensitizing agents in tumors
overexpressing both CAXII and Pgp. Given the prevalent
expression of CAXII in tumor tissues and the high
selectivity of our inhibitors towards this CA isoform,
our compounds appear as promising tumor-selective
agents. These results may be a turning point toward new
treatments based on a combination of a CAXII selective
inhibitor with chemotherapeutic drugs, where the
chemotherapeutic drugs alone are ineffective in treating
Pgp-positive (i.e. MDR) tumors. This approach may be
particularly beneficial for patients with tumors that co85871

express CAXII and Pgp, a typical feature of aggressive
and chemoresistant tumors. Furthermore, neo-adjuvant
protocols based on anthracyclines are currently used in the
treatment of breast cancer to improve patient outcomes,
with the purpose to reduce tumor mass and allow a more
conservative surgery [31]. In a translational perspective
our study may provide the rational basis for a new neoadjuvant combinatorial therapy for breast tumors to
enhance the effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
drugs, i.e. the loco-regional administration of a CAXII
inhibitor as a chemosensitizer agent followed by
systemic administration of doxorubicin. To the best of
our knowledge, such an approach has not been reported.
The expression of CAIX, the more well studied cancerassociated CA isozyme, did not influence the effects of the
compounds on the intracellular doxorubicin accumulation
in all cell lines tested. We recommend that future studies
involving CAs in cancer concomitantly examine CAIX
and CAXII expression, rather than only CAIX, to better
inform the interpretation of experimental findings.

constants were obtained by nonlinear least-squares methods
using PRISM 3. The curve fitting algorithm allowed us to
obtain the IC50 values, from which Ki values were calculated
by using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.

Cell lines

cells, breast cancer MCF-7, SKBR3, T74D and MDAMB-231 cells, osteosarcoma U2OS and SaOS cells,
murine chemoresistant JC cells, not-transformed human
colon epithelial CCD-Co-18 cells, lung epithelial BEAS2B cells, breast epithelial MCF10A cells were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Murine chemoresistant
TUBO cells were a kind gift of Prof. Federica Cavallo,
Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health
Sciences, University of Torino, Italy. Not-transformed
human fibroblasts were a kind gift of Prof. Franco Novelli,
Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health

medium with increasing concentration of doxorubicin,
as reported by us [34], and maintained in culture
medium with a final concentration of 200 nM and 100
nM doxorubicin, respectively. U2OS/DX and SaOS/DX
cells were generated with a similar procedure [35] and
maintained in culture medium with a final concentration
of 1 μM doxorubicin. The expression levels of CAXII,
CAIX and Pgp were measured by immunoblotting (see
below): the results are reported in the Supplementary
Figure S1. All cell lines were authenticated by
microsatellite analysis, using the PowerPlex kit (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI; last authentication: June
2016). Cells were maintained in media supplemented
with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% v/v penicillinstreptomycin, 1% v/v L-glutamine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
The plasticware for cell cultures was obtained
from Falcon (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
The electrophoresis reagents were obtained from BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). The protein content
of cell lysates was assessed with the BCA kit from
Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO). Tariquidar
dihydrochloride was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).
Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were purchased

CAXII inhibitors
The synthesis and structural characterization
of carbohydrate-based sulfamates (1–4) [32, 33] and
sulfonamides (5–8) [12] has been fully described
previously by us. The chemical structure of the compounds
is reported in Figure 1.

Immunoblotting
For whole cell lysates, the cells were rinsed with
ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM, Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 1% v/v
Triton-X100), supplemented with the protease inhibitor
cocktail set III (80 μM aprotinin, 5 mM bestatin, 1.5 mM
leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA),
2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mM Na3VO4,
then sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000× g for 10 min at
4oC. 20 μg protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE
and probed with the following antibodies: anti-CAXII
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-CAIX (Novus Biologicals,
Littleton, CO), anti-Pgp (C219, Calbiochem), anti-βtubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA),
followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membranes were washed
with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 0.1% v/v solution, and the
proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Plasma membrane-associated

CA inhibition
The inhibition of CA I, II, IX and XII by test
inhibitors (1–8) has been previously reported by us [12, 32,
33]. Inhibition data and isozyme selectivity values are
reported in Table 1. Briefly, a stopped-flow instrument was
used to monitor the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration reaction
for a period of 10–100 s with phenol red as a pH indicator.
Saturated CO2 solutions in water at 20°C were used as
substrate, while the recombinant CA protein was prepared in
Hepes buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) with added NaClO4 (0.1 M)
to maintain a constant the ionic strength. The inhibitor
and enzyme solutions were preincubated for 15 min at
room temperature prior to assay in order to allow for the

proteins were evaluated in biotinylation assays, using the
Cell Surface Protein isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Waltham, MA), as previously reported [36]. An
anti-pancadherin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.) was used to confirm equal protein loading. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 100 μg of plasma
membrane-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated
with the anti-Pgp antibody, using the PureProteome protein
A and protein G Magnetic Beads (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and probed with anti-CAXII or anti-Pgp antibodies,
followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.

the Pgp ATPase activity. Results were expressed as nmol
hydrolyzed phosphate (Pi)/min/mg proteins, according to
the titration curve previously prepared.

pHi measurement
pHi was measured by incubating whole cells
with 5 µM 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester for 15 min at
37°C and reading the intracellular fluorescence by a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The
intracellular fluorescence was converted into pH units
according to a titration curve, as described previously [24].

Pgp overexpression

Ca12 knockout

To generate the Pgp-positive MCF7 and SKBR3
cells, the pHa vector containing the complete mdr1
cDNA was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA)
and subcloned into pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Milan, Italy) as described [37].

5 × 105 cells were transduced with 1 μg RNA vector
(CRISPR pCas guide vector) ca12 or 1 μg not-targeting
vector, mixed with 1 μg donor DNA vector (Origene,
Rockville, MD), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Stable KO cells were selected in complete medium
containing 1 μg/ml puromycin for three weeks. Knockout
efficacy was evaluated by immunoblotting, as reported
above. Cell viability was evaluated by neutral red staining:
ca12 KO cells had the same viability than parental cells
(data not shown).

Chemotherapeutic drug accumulation
Doxorubicin content was measured fluorimetrically
as detailed previously by us [34]. Vinblastine and
paclitaxel accumulation were measured by labelling
cells with 1 µCi [3H]-vinblastine sulphate (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA) and [3H]-paclitaxel (Moravek Inc., Brea,
CA). Cells were washed twice with PBS, detached with
trypsin and sonicated. The intracellular drug content
was measured by liquid scintillation. The results were
expressed as nmol drug/mg cell proteins, according to
titration curves previously set.

In vivo tumor growth
To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of CAXII
inhibitors, we injected subcutaneously 1 × 106 JC cells, a
mammary cancer cell line known for its high expression
of Pgp [26] and its strong refractoriness to doxorubicin
[27], mixed with 100 µL Matrigel, in syngeneic 6 weekold female BALB/c mice (weight: 20 g ± 1.3; Charles
River Laboratories Italia, Calco). Animals were housed
(5 per cage) under 12 h light/dark cycles, with food
and drinking provided ad libitum. Tumor growth was
measured daily by caliper and calculated according to the
equation (L × W2)/2, where L = tumor length, W = tumor
width. When the tumor reached a volume of 100 mm3
(day 7 after injection), the mice were randomized into
8 groups (10 animals/group) and treated on days 0, 6 and
12 after the randomization as it follows: 1) control group,
treated with 0.1 ml saline solution intravenously (i.v.); 2)
doxorubicin group, treated with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v.; 3)
tariquidar group, treated with 5 mg/kg tariquidar per os; 4)
C1 19 group, treated with 19 ng/kg compound 1 (in 0.1 ml
saline solution; final concentration: 10 nM) intratumorally;
5) C1 1900 group, treated with 1900 ng/kg compound
1 (in 0.1 ml saline solution; final concentration: 1 µM)
intratumorally; 6) doxorubicin + tariquidar group, treated
with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v. and 5 mg/kg tariquidar per
os; 7) doxorubicin + C1 19 group, treated with 5 mg/kg
doxorubicin i.v. and 19 ng/kg compound 1 intratumorally;
8) doxorubicin + C1 1900 group, treated with 5 mg/kg
doxorubicin i.v. and 1900 ng/kg compound 1 intratumorally.

Cell viability
Cell viability was evaluated by measuring the
percentage of cells stained with neutral red dye, as
reported previously [38]. The viability of untreated
cells was considered 100%; the results were expressed
as percentage of viable cells in each experimental
condition versus untreated cells. To determine the IC50 of
doxorubicin in CAXII inhibitor treated cells 5 × 105 cells,
with concentrations of doxorubicin (ranging from 1 nM
to 1 mM), were incubated in the absence or presence of
5 nM of each CAXII inhibitor for 72 h. The inhibitory
concentration 50 (IC50) is defined as the concentration of
doxorubicin that kills 50% of cells. The resistance factor
(Rf) was calculated as the ratio between mean IC50 in
cells treated with CAXII inhibitors and mean IC50 in cells
treated with tarquidar.

Pgp ATPase activity
The assay was performed on Pgp-enriched membrane
vesicles as detailed in [39]. Verapamil (10 µM) was added
to the reaction mix to achieve a maximal activation of
