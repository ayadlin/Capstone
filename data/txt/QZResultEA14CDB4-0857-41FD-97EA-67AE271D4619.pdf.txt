ABSTRACT
Many cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy production and targeting
of this pathway is a potential strategy to inhibit cancer cell growth. In this study,
inhibition of five glycolysis pathway molecules (GLUT1, HKII, PFKFB3, PDHK1 and
LDH) using 9 inhibitors (Phloretin, Quercetin, STF31, WZB117, 3PO, 3-bromopyruvate,
Dichloroacetate, Oxamic acid, NHI-1) was investigated in panels of breast and ovarian
cancer cell line models. All compounds tested blocked glycolysis as indicated by
increased extracellular glucose and decreased lactate production and also increased
apoptosis. Sensitivity to several inhibitors correlated with the proliferation rate of
the cell lines. Seven compounds had IC50 values that were associated with each
other consistent with a shared mechanism of action. A synergistic interaction was
revealed between STF31 and Oxamic acid when combined with the antidiabetic drug
metformin. Sensitivity to glycolysis inhibition was also examined under a range of O2
levels (21% O2, 7% O2, 2% O2 and 0.5% O2) and greater resistance to the inhibitors
was found at low oxygen conditions (7% O2, 2% O2 and 0.5% O2) relative to 21% O2
conditions. These results indicate growth of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines
is dependent on all the targets examined in the glycolytic pathway with increased
sensitivity to the inhibitors under normoxic conditions.

dependence on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
and are more reliant on glycolysis provides a wide range
of potential targets for therapy. Targeting aerobic glycolysis
is a promising strategy to preferentially kill cancer cells
which are dependent on this pathway and in recent years
multiple glycolytic inhibitors have been developed [4–6].
However, to date only a few agents have been assessed
within in vivo experiments and even fewer have undergone
clinical trials [4–6].
The glycolytic pathway comprises a series of
ten reactions (Figure 1). All of the enzymes within the
glycolysis pathway potentially represent targets for
anticancer treatment and inhibitors have been developed
that target molecular components of this pathway [4–6]

INTRODUCTION
In the 1920s, Otto Warburg demonstrated that
cancer cells exhibit an alteration in their metabolism
when compared with non-malignant cells. Normal
cells in the presence of oxygen use primarily the
mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative
phosphorylation for the production of energy and rely on
glycolysis only when their oxygen supply is limited. In
contrast, cancer cells frequently utilise glycolysis even
in the presence of sufficient amounts of oxygen [1, 2].
This persistence of aerobic glycolysis in many cancers
is now well substantiated and considered a ‘hallmark’ of
advanced cancers [3]. The fact that cancer cells reduce their

Figure 1: Scheme of selected components of the glycolysis pathway and the inhibitors studied. One molecule of glucose
is catabolised to two molecules of pyruvate releasing two ATP molecules. Glucose is transported into the cell by the glucose transporter
(GLUT) family of molecules and, once inside the cell, is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase. After conversion
of G6P to fructose-6-phosphate, a second phosphate group is added to fructose-6-phosphate by 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1). Several
more enzyme reactions eventually produce pyruvate. In normal tissues under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is directed into the mitochondrion
by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and this is
also facilitated by the increased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), which blocks PDH activity. In malignant cells, this
conversion of pyruvate to lactate occurs even under aerobic conditions and has been denoted the Warburg effect.

(Figure 1). Inhibitors of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)
include the flavonoids Phloretin and Quercetin [7]. Flavonoids
are polyphenolic substances, abundantly distributed in plants,
fruits and vegetables and are well known for their powerful
anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects [8]. Furthermore,
they have been shown to inhibit glucose transmembrane
transport and proven to have preclinical anticancer activity
[7,  8]. Phloretin, mainly found in the members of the
Rosaceae family, has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis
in breast cancer cells as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma
both in vitro and in vivo [9, 10]. Quercetin has been shown
to induce apoptosis in breast and colon cancer cell lines
[11, 12]. Recently, Chan et al. identified STF31, a compound
which induces cell death selectively in VHL-deficient renal
cell carcinoma cells by binding specifically to GLUT1 and
impairing glucose uptake [13]. WZB117 is a novel specific
GLUT1 inhibitor causing suppression of glucose metabolism,
inhibition of cellular proliferation both in vitro and in vivo
and cell-cycle arrest leading to senescence and necrosis [14].

Inhibitors of hexokinase II include 3-bromopyruvate
(3BP) [15, 16]. This compound has demonstrated
anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo. It directly
inhibits mitochondrial bound hexokinase-II which is
up-regulated in many types of cancer. A cytotoxic inhibitory
effect has been documented in many types of cancer
including melanoma, glioblastoma, mesothelioma, as well
as pancreatic, hepatocellular and breast carcinoma [15, 16].
3-(3-Pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one] (3PO) is
a novel small molecule inhibitor of PFKFB3, an isozyme
which is a component of fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,
6-BP), an allosteric activator of PFK1 [17]. It has been shown
that 3PO suppresses phosphofructokinase activity, decreases
glucose uptake and induces growth inhibition in several cell
lines, including Ras–transformed cells and additionally in
established tumors in vivo [17]. PFK158, an optimised 3PO
compound, is now undergoing a clinical trial [18].
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a pyruvate analogue
which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK1),

25678

Oncotarget

an enzyme which inhibits the mitochondrial pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH). In this way it suppresses glycolysis
and stimulates oxidative phosphorylation. It is reported
to have antitumor activity both in vitro, in several types
of cancer, and in vivo [19, 20]. DCA is now currently
undergoing clinical trials [21] and while promising results
were obtained in 3 of 5 glioblastoma patients treated with
DCA alongside temozolomide and radiotherapy [22],
combination therapy trials with platinum have so far
failed to show activity against non-small cell lung cancer
[23]. Furthermore, the drug is not without toxicity and
at high concentrations produces peripheral neuropathy
[22]. Oxamic acid is an established pyruvate analogue
and a competitive lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor.
Some promising anti-proliferative effects have been
documented in vitro using cervical adenocarcinoma and
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines [24, 25]. In 2011
Granchi et al. published the identification of several novel
N-hydroxyindole-based (NHI) LDH Inhibitors [26]. NHI-1
(aka compound 1j) is a competitive isoform selective LDH
A inhibitor [26]. It has been shown to diminish lactate
production and inhibit cell proliferation in a variety of
cancer cell lines [26, 27].
This study examined the effects of these inhibitors
on breast and ovarian cancer cell lines by using cell
proliferation, glucose and lactate assays, to assess impact
on aerobic glycolysis. While there are reports of these
agents showing activity against various cancer cell line
models, we are not aware of any detailed comparative
studies of multiple inhibitors against panels of either breast
or ovarian cancer cell line models. We sought to understand
why certain cell lines were more sensitive to inhibitors of
these pathways.
Metformin is a biguanide widely prescribed for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An increasing number
of epidemiologic studies have associated metformin
with a decreased risk of several types of cancer and
improved clinical outcome in diabetic cancer patients [28].
Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain
complex I and its anticancer effect is mainly attributed
to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) resulting in decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis
[28–30]. Here we hypothesized that since metformin
decreases ATP production, inhibiting mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation, a combined inhibition of the
glycolytic pathway could possibly result in a complete
depletion of cellular ATP and lead to increased cell death.
An additional objective of this study was to evaluate
the effect of these inhibitors under varying oxygenation
levels. Previous reports have revealed considerable
intratumoral heterogeneity in oxygenation status, as well
as increased variability among individual solid tumors
[31]. For breast cancers, Vaupel et al. reported marked
variability in oxygen levels (from 13%–0% oxygen)
even when comparing tumors of the same stage, grade
and histology. Furthermore, they demonstrated great
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

heterogeneity in the oxygenation of individual tumors
with hypoxic and anoxic areas distributed within the
same tumor tissue [31]. Hypoxia is a well substantiated
common feature of the tumor microenvironment that
contributes to resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy
and tumor relapse. The transcription factor HIF-1 (Hypoxia
Inducible Factor 1) is induced by hypoxia and regulates
expression of proteins that enable cells to survive hypoxia
[32]. Many of the glycolytic enzymes, including all the
targets selected here (GLUT1, Hexokinase II, PFKFB3,
PDHK1 and LDHA), are known to be HIF1-inducible [32].
Previous studies using these inhibitors have demonstrated
both reduced and increased potency in hypoxic conditions
dependent on the inhibitor and cancer model, hence we
were interested to ascertain their effects in breast and
ovarian cancer cell line models. To date, most experimental
studies have been carried out under normoxic conditions.
This study investigated the sensitivity of breast cancer
cells to glycolytic inhibitors at a range of oxygen levels
(21% –7% –2% –0.5% O2), the latter three representing
more closely the microenvironment of clinical cancers.

RESULTS
Targeted inhibition of the glycolysis pathway in
breast and ovarian cancer cell lines
The effect of inhibitors targeted against upstream
components of the glycolysis pathway (GLUT1, hexokinase
II, PFKFB3) and the downstream component LDH-A were
compared on cell proliferation. These were also compared
with an inhibitor (DCA) of PDHK1 which promotes
conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Proliferation was
assessed by use of a sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay
and growth was assayed after a 5-day treatment period.
Concentration response curves for the breast and ovarian
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table 1) are illustrated in
Figures 2 and 3 respectively and IC50 values are recorded
in Table 1.
Four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDAMB-231, HBL100 and BT549) were first investigated
(Figure 2). Four GLUT1 inhibitors, Phloretin, Quercetin,
STF31 and WZB117, were compared. The flavonoids
Phloretin and Quercetin had similar effects on the growth
of the cell lines. For Phloretin, the IC50 values ranged
between 36–135 μM while IC50 values ranged between
44–106 μM for Quercetin. STF31 produced a much
larger differential effect between the cell lines. MCF7 and HBL100 cells were very sensitive while BT549
cells showed resistance to the compound. The IC50 values
varied markedly and ranged between 0.2–18 μM. In
contrast, WZB117 had a very similar effect on all four cell
lines with IC50 values ranging between 5.2–6.6 μM. 3BP
which targets hexokinase II had IC50 values that ranged
between 10–84 μM; MCF-7, HBL100 and BT549 cells
had a similar response, while MDA-MB-231 cells were

Quercetin concentrations between 0.6–300 μΜ, STF31 concentrations between 0.06–30 μΜ, WZB117 concentrations between
0.06–30 μΜ, 3BP concentrations between 0.6–300 μΜ, 3PO concentrations between 0.005–100 μM, DCA concentrations
between 0.4–100 mΜ, Oxamic acid concentrations between 0.2–100 mΜ and NHI-1 concentrations between 0.6–300 μΜ.

more resistant. All cell lines responded in a similar way
to 3PO which targets PFKFB3 having IC50 values between
2.1–3.8 μM. For DCA the concentrations needed were
higher compared to the previous inhibitors and were in
the millimolar concentration range. MCF-7 proved the
most sensitive breast cancer cell line (IC50 6.8 mM), while
HBL100 (IC50 18.9 mM) was least sensitive. Finally, for
NHI-1 and Oxamic acid which target LDH-A, the IC50

values ranged between 27–58 mM for Oxamic acid and
between 8–53 μM for NHI-1. The MDA-MB-231 cell line
was found more resistant to several of the inhibitors.
For the 4 ovarian cancer cell lines, similar datasets
were obtained (Figure 3). Phloretin inhibited cell
proliferation with IC50 values ranging between 51–197 μM
and Quercetin with values between 21–240 μM. STF31
and WZB117 produced increased differential effects

between the cell lines. The IC50 values ranged between 0.2
to greater than 30 μM for STF31 and between 1.4 to greater
than 30 μM for WZB117. OVCAR3 cells demonstrated
resistance to STF31 and OVCAR5 cells were resistant
to WZB117. For 3BP, the IC50 values ranged between
16–84 μM with the CAOV3 cell line demonstrating
most resistance to this compound. Regarding 3PO, the
TOV112D cell line was the most sensitive with IC50 value

almost 1.2 μM while CAOV3 was least sensitive, with an
IC50 5 times higher. DCA and Oxamic acid again required
much greater (millimolar) concentrations compared to
the other compounds. In both cases, TOV112D cell line
showed the lowest IC50 values (5.5 mM for DCA and
24 mM for Oxamic acid) while CAOV3 had the highest
(20 mM for DCA and 59 mM for Oxamic acid). Finally, for
NHI-1 the IC50 values ranged between 28–91 μM.

assay, for each specific cell line. Both sets of measurements
were conducted on the same day from the same sample.
All the inhibitors tested proved effective in blocking
glycolysis in at least one of the two cell lines tested (Figure 4).
Increasing concentrations of Phloretin caused an increase in
the glucose remaining in the media while lactate production
decreased following the same pattern. Regarding the other
three glucose transport inhibitors Quercetin, STF31 and
WZB117, even the lowest concentration used produced a
maximal effect causing accumulation of glucose and depletion
of lactate in the culture media. 3BP, 3PO and DCA were also
effective in inhibiting glycolysis. Low concentrations of each
compound caused a large increase in the glucose accumulating
in the media and a corresponding decline in the secreted
lactate. The inhibition of glycolysis hit a plateau with treatment
of 10 μM 3BP, 10 μM 3PO or 10 mM DCA and no apparent
additional effect was detected with increasing concentrations.
The lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors likewise suppressed
glycolysis. Following treatment with NHI-1 and Oxamic acid,

cells demonstrated a modest increase in glucose and a more
profound depletion of lactate in their culture media.

Glycolytic inhibitors induced apoptosis
To investigate whether the growth inhibitory effect of
these compounds was associated with induction of apoptotic
cell death, flow cytometric analysis was performed. MCF-7
cells were treated with 9 glycolytic inhibitors for 48 h, stained
with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and PI and analysed using
flow cytometry. Cells were separated into four different groups,
the lower left quadrant represents intact viable cells (Annexin
negative and PI negative), the upper left quadrant represents
early apoptotic cells (Annexin positive and PI negative), the
upper right quadrant represents late apoptotic cells (Annexin
positive and PI positive) and the lower right quadrant
represents necrotic cells (Annexin negative and PI positive).
Cells stained with Annexin-FITC were collectively considered
as apoptotic cells (upper region). As shown in Figure 5A there

treatment with the glycolytic inhibitors compared to untreated
cells. Untreated cells showed 7% apoptosis (Annexin positive)
whereas for cells treated with 300 μM Phloretin the percentage
of apoptotic cells increased to 43%, with 300 μM Quercetin
to 25%, with 30 μM STF31 to 29%, with 30 μM WZB117

indicating that sensitivity to 7 of these inhibitors
correlated with each other (Supplementary Table 2).
The correlation heatmap in Figure 6A illustrated that
7 inhibitors (Phloretin, Quercetin, 3BP, 3PO, DCA,
NHI-1 and Oxamic acid) had IC50 concentrations that
gave high Pearson R correlation values when compared
to each other. This is consistent with these agents
sharing a common mechanism of action targeting the
same pathway. STF31 and WZB117 did not significantly
correlate with any of the other agents. The expression
levels of GLUT1, hexokinase  II, PFKFB3, PDHK1
and LDHA were examined in the cell line panel
(Supplementary Figure 1). No significant correlation
between the expression of the targets in the eight cell
lines and their sensitivity to the inhibitors was detected

(data not shown). Sensitivity to STF31 and Oxamic
acid was found to correlate significantly with the
proliferation rate of the cell lines, giving p values of
0.0368 and 0.0046 respectively. The fastest growing cell
lines were more sensitive to these compounds while the
slowest growing cell lines presented greater resistance
(Figure 6B).

different concentrations of two glycolytic inhibitors, STF31
and Oxamic acid, was used in combination with a constant
fixed concentration of metformin and incubation lasted for
72 h. Metformin enhanced the potency of both STF31 and
Oxamic acid to inhibit cancer cell proliferation compared
to the effect of these drugs individually (Figure  7A).
To evaluate the efficacy of the combinations, data were
analysed using the Calcusyn Software and Combination
Index (CI) values were generated (Tables 2a, 2b). Examples
of synergistic combinations are depicted in Figure 7B. For
example, 1.9 μM of STF31 alone reduced the percentage of
cell number to 78% and 3mM of metformin to 87% while
the combination of both drugs reduced the cell number to
37% compared to untreated cells. For this combination a CI
value equal to 0.182 is generated which is characterised as

lower oxygen levels (2% O2 and 0.5% O2) differed between
the compounds. In some cases, cells became even more
resistant to the compounds increasing further their IC50
value (e.g. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with Oxamic acid
– Figure 8g), or presented a modest decrease (e.g. MDAMB-231 cells treated with DCA – Figure 8f). In the majority
of the treatments, response between the three lower levels
was similar. Both cell lines were more resistant to the whole
panel of glycolytic inhibitors under any of the lower oxygen
levels tested compared to 21% O2 conditions (Table 3).
When drug IC50 was correlated with growth rate under
the range of differing O2 concentrations for both cell lines,
there was in general a significant inverse association between
higher growth rates and lower IC50 with increasing oxygen
level (Supplementary Table 3).

Growth inhibition at varying oxygen tensions
We next sought to examine the effect of the oxygen
level on sensitivity to these glycolytic inhibitors. For this
purpose two breast cancer cell lines were selected, the ER
positive, luminal A MCF-7 and the basal B, triple negative
MDA-MB-231 lines. The breast cancer cells were adapted
to the different oxygen conditions, before being treated
with eight of the glycolytic inhibitors. The SRB assay
was performed after a five day treatment. In Figure 8 is
depicted the percentage of cell number for the two cell
lines against increasing concentration of each of the
eight compounds under four different oxygen conditions
21% O2, 7% O2, 2% O2, 0.5% O2. Table 3 presents the
corresponding IC50 values.
Both cell lines were sensitive to all the inhibitors
in hypoxic conditions. The most striking observation was

were taken from cells cultured in 0.5% O2, 2% O2 and 7% O2 for different periods of time, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Samples are presented as
follows: 21% O2, 21% O2, 7% O2 24 h, 7% O2 48 h, 7% O2 72 h, 2% O2 24 h, 2% O2 48 h, 2% O2 72 h, 0.5% O2 24 h, 0.5% O2 48 h and

PDHK1 and LDHA expression was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System software (Licor).

Expression of the GLUT1 transporter as well as of
the Hexokinase II, PFKFB3, PDHK1 and LDHA enzymes
were examined in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells cultured

at 21% O2 (Figure 9 - Supplementary Figures 2,  3).

the glycolysis pathway in breast and ovarian cancer cell
line models. All inhibitors induced apoptosis and blocked
glycolysis irrespective of their target and point of action
in the pathway. The majority of these compounds had IC50
concentrations that correlated significantly with each other

A second objective was to examine the effect of selected
glycolytic inhibitors in combination with the antidiabetic
drug metformin. The third aim of the study was to
investigate the impact of varying levels of O2 on inhibitor
efficacy - increasing concentrations of oxygen resulted in

inhibitors caused glucose accumulation in the media of
cultured cells combined with a decline in the production
of lactate, the final product of glycolysis (Figure 4). It
is noteworthy that even when targeting the final step of
the pathway an effect on the uptake of glucose can be
observed. This is attributed to the tight allosteric regulation
of the key glycolytic enzymes [33]. All the tested
compounds inhibited cell proliferation of both breast and
ovarian cancer cells, in a concentration-dependent manner
at concentrations associated with glycolytic inhibition
(Figures 2, 3). Each of the inhibitors presented a different
potential in attenuating cell proliferation. More recently
developed compounds (STF31, WZB117, 3PO and
NHI-1) proved more potent and inhibited tumor cell
growth at lower concentrations. The compounds Phloretin,
3PO, DCA, NHI1 and 3BP had clear cytotoxic effects on
the majority of cell lines while Quercetin, WZB117 and
Oxamic acid showed cytostatic effects (judged based
on the comparison of the cell number on day 0 –the day
of treatment- and day 5 of treatment; data not shown).
The breast and ovarian cancer cell line models studied
demonstrated similar sensitivities to these agents.
GLUT1 facilitates basal glucose transport across the
plasma membrane. In breast cancer, increased expression
of GLUT1 has been reported to be associated with high
grade tumors, basal-like subtype, high proliferative
index as measured by Ki-67 and poor survival [34–37].
Similarly, an association between high GLUT1 expression
and poor outcome has been observed for ovarian cancer
[38] suggesting GLUT1 might be a promising target for
therapeutic inhibition. The novel GLUT1 inhibitors, STF31
and WZB117 proved inhibitory at lower concentrations
when compared to the flavonoids Phloretin and Quercetin.
STF31 demonstrated a marked differential effect between
the cell lines. It caused a potent cytotoxic effect in the
HBL100 breast and TOV112D ovarian cell lines (with
an IC50 as low as 0.1 μM) whereas the BT549 breast and
OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell lines were found to be
highly resistant to the compound. Its activity was first
reported in renal cell cancer cell line models [13] and we
are unaware of antitumor data being reported in breast or
ovarian cancer systems. While the breast cancer cell lines
exhibited a similar response to WZB117, with almost
identical IC50 values, ovarian cancer cell lines showed a
significant variation in their response. OVCAR3 cells
showed increased sensitivity (IC50 1.4 μM) while OVCAR5
cells were found resistant. In the only published report to
date of WZB117, the IC50 in MCF-7 cells (approximately
10 μM) was similar to the value (6.4 μM) observed here
[14]. (Table 1).
Hexokinase II catalyses the ATP-dependent
phosphorylation of glucose. Hexokinase II (HKII), the
mitochondrial-bound isozyme, is associated with poor
outcome in both breast [39] and ovarian cancers [40].
3BP proved a potent compound causing a concentrationdependent reduction in the number of viable cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells. Breast and ovarian cancer cells presented similar
sensitivity. The anti-glycolytic effect of 3BP has previously
been demonstrated by decreased FDG uptake in a rat breast
cancer model [41]. 3BP has also been shown to have
possible value in targeting ovarian cancer tumor initiating
cells [42].
PFKFB3
catalyses
the
ATP-dependent
phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate and produces
Fru-2, 6-BP an allosteric activator of PFK1. It is more
highly expressed in breast and ovarian cancers relative
to normal tissue [42]. 3PO, a PFKFB3 inhibitor, proved
a potent inhibitor in these cell lines. Breast cancer cells
lines responded in a similar way while the ovarian cancer
cell lines exhibited greater variation in their response. 3PO
has already demonstrated promising activity in an MDAMB-231 breast cancer xenograft model and since these
other breast cancer cell lines tested here have increased
sensitivity, while the ovarian cancer cell lines have similar
sensitivities to the MDA-MB-231 cell line, this would
suggest that in vivo activity might be obtained in further
models [17].
PDHK1 phosphorylates and inactivates PDH and in
this way prevents pyruvate from entering the mitochondrial
TCA cycle. DCA effectively attenuated cell proliferation
in millimolar concentrations in these cell lines and IC50
values varied between 5 and 20 mM (Table 1). While it
is feasible to achieve concentrations of 1mM in patients
[23], these concentrations are insufficient for single agent
consideration and combination approaches which require
lower concentrations of inhibitors are more likely to be
beneficial.
The final target of the glycolytic pathway examined
was LDH, a tetramer of A and B subunits that catalyses
the reduction of pyruvate to lactate coupled with NADH
oxidation. NHI-1 was found to be a much more potent
inhibitor than Oxamic acid. Breast and ovarian cancer cells
had a similar response to Oxamic acid (Table 1). NHI-1 has
been shown to produce synergistic activity when used in
combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cell line
models [27] and it may be that combination with cytotoxic
drugs would be worth exploring within breast and ovarian
cancer models.
The mechanism of action of these inhibitors was also
investigated using flow cytometric analysis of treated cells
stained with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and Propidium
Iodide. Annexin V is a calcium dependent protein that binds
to phosphatidylserine when exposed to the extracellular
membrane of apoptotic cells. The viability dye PI is
excluded from the intact cell membrane of viable cells.
With this staining it is possible to distinguish between early
apoptotic (Annexin V positive), late apoptotic (Annexin V
and PI positive) and necrotic cells (PI positive). Evidence
was obtained that all 9 of these inhibitors induce apoptosis.
After a 48 h treatment all of them caused an induction of
both early and late apoptosis (Figures 5a, 5b), consistent
with targeting a common pathway.

The expression levels of the glycolytic targets did not
vary markedly in this panel of cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 1) and no clear association between expression
level and inhibitor response was apparent. We observed
though that sensitivity to STF31 (GLUT1 inhibitor) and
Oxamic acid (LDHA inhibitor) correlated significantly
with the proliferation rate of the cell lines (Figure 6B). The
differential effect of these compounds to the various cell
lines can be explained by the difference in their growth
rate. The most rapidly growing cell lines were found to
be more sensitive to these compounds and these are likely
to be more dependent on glycolysis for the production of
energy and the metabolic intermediates needed for the
biosynthesis of macromolecules and for that reason more
sensitive to the glycolytic inhibitors.
Seven inhibitors demonstrated a correlation in
their IC50 values in the panel of cell lines and these were
Phloretin, Quercetin, 3BP, 3PO, DCA, NHI-1 and Oxamic
acid. This would be consistent with their possessing
a common mechanism of action i.e. inhibition of the
glycolysis pathway. The two remaining inhibitors, STF31
and WZB117, did not correlate and it is feasible that
inhibition of other (non-glycolytic pathway) targets may
be responsible for their actions. Certainly, for STF31,
a recent report has indicated that it can also inhibit
nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) which
may contribute to its growth inhibitory activity [43].
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in
the anti-proliferative effects of metformin. This widely
prescribed antidiabetic drug, because of its low toxicity
profile and its established efficacy to target metabolism, has
attracted a great deal of attention. A considerable volume
of literature has associated metformin with a decreased
cancer risk and in addition metformin has been shown
in many cases to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy
[28, 29]. Currently metformin is undergoing several
clinical trials in various cancer types as monotherapy or
in combination with other drugs [28]. It has been shown
to enhance cisplatin and paclitaxel efficacy in endometrial
cancer cells [44] as well as cisplatin efficacy in ovarian
cancer cells in vivo inhibiting also metastasis in the lung
[45]. In another study Iliopoulos et al. showed a synergistic
effect between metformin and Doxorubicin in a xenograft
model using prostate and lung cancer cells [46]. Regarding
glycolytic inhibitors two separate research groups, Sahra
et al. in 2010 and Cheong et al. in 2011, demonstrated a
synergistic effect between metformin and 2-deoxyglucose
(2DG) in prostate cancer cells and mouse xenograft models
respectively [47, 48]. Moreover in 2014 Choi et al. reported
that DCA enhanced metformin potency in inducing cell
death in HeLa cells [49].
Encouraged by promising evidence in previous
studies we hypothesised that targeting two energy pathways
simultaneously; the glycolytic pathway and mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation, could result in greater energy
depletion and enhance cell death of cancer cells. The
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

selected cell line for combination experiments was
the triple negative MDA-MB-231. These tumors are
considered aggressive and invasive and have limited
treatment options [50]. In addition this cell line lacks the
functional tumor suppressor gene LKB1 [51]. This is an
upstream kinase responsible for the activation of AMPK
and is considered important for metformin’s antitumor
effect [29]. Our results are in agreement with findings
from Zordoky et al. which showed that MDA-MB-231
cells are sensitive to metformin even though they are
LKB1 deficient [51]. In terms of the culture conditions it
should be mentioned that these experiments were contacted
in 5.56 mM glucose medium equivalent to physiological
serum glucose levels, taking into consideration findings
from previous studies indicating dependence of
metformin’s action on glucose availability [49, 51]. We
provide evidence of a synergistic interaction between
STF31 and metformin as well as between Oxamic acid and
metformin (Figure 7A). The CI values generated for both
combinations were lower than 0.8 and indicate synergy.
The concentrations of 3 and 4 mM Metformin tested are
relatively high but millimolar concentrations of the drug
have been demonstrated to be achievable in vivo as the
drug, being stable and not metabolized, can accumulate
in tissues at much higher concentrations than in the blood
[52]. These findings suggest a potential strategy for triple
negative breast cancer treatment.
A key objective of this study was to investigate the
sensitivity to the glycolytic inhibitors under varying levels
of hypoxia. A published report of a series of normal and
malignant breast tissues had indicated a median oxygen
level of 8.6% O2 in normal breast tissue (n = 16) compared
to a median value of 4% O2 in a series (n = 15) of malignant
breast cancers [31]. Multiple measurements obtained
within individual breast cancers demonstrated values
varying between 0 and 13% O2 indicating the diversity
and mixture of differentially oxygenated populations that
co-exist within individual tumors [31]. To test sensitivity,
two representative breast cancer cell lines were selected.
Dependence on glycolysis was examined over a range
of oxygen levels varying from 21% to 0.5% O2 and both
cell lines examined were more sensitive to all glycolytic
inhibitors at 21% O2 conditions.
Previous studies investigating these inhibitors in
normoxic and hypoxic conditions against other cancer
cell lines have demonstrated widely contrasting results
with some studies suggesting enhanced activity under
normoxic conditions, other studies suggesting enhanced
activity under hypoxic conditions and the majority of
studies showing equivalent activity or minimally changed
activity under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
[53–59]. For example, Phloretin is equally effective under
normoxic and hypoxic conditions against the SW620
colon and K562 leukemia cell lines [53] while WZB117
is more effective against hypoxic than normoxic cells [14].
3BP has previously been shown to be minimally more
25690

Oncotarget

cytotoxic under hypoxic conditions [54–56] than normoxic
conditions although the effects in these studies were very
modest and are not dissimilar to other studies which
indicate no difference between normoxia and hypoxia [57].
The LDH inhibitor NHI-1 is more effective in hypoxic
than normoxic systems [27]. In contrast, several studies
have shown that DCA is more cytotoxic in normoxic than
hypoxic conditions [58, 59].
Increased dependency under hypoxic conditions
might arise through up-regulation of the drug target
providing a greater stimulus in cells hence its blockade
might be more effective. Equally, increased drug target
might also require more inhibitor to block its efficacy
and furthermore other pathway components will also
be up-regulated by hypoxia, requiring more drug to
produce inhibition compared to normoxic conditions. The
modulation of the drug targets was examined under these
varying oxygen conditions and of the five targets examined,
PFKFB3 and PDHK1 were up-regulated under hypoxic
conditions in both cancer cell lines, while Hexokinase II
and LDHA were up-regulated only in MCDF-7 cells at
0.5% O2. Therefore relative resistance to the compounds
at low O2 levels could be attributed at least in part to
increased expression of the targets.
Another factor that should be taken into
consideration is that cells grow more slowly in low O2
concentration and this might contribute to the decreased
sensitivity to the compounds. There were significant
associations for most of the compounds between growth
rate and drug potency (i.e. IC50) across the panel of cell
lines (Supplementary Table 3).
Together, these data indicate that inhibition of
glycolysis is associated with growth inhibition in these
breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Combination of
glycolytic inhibitors with metformin is proposed as
a promising strategy for triple negative breast cancer
treatment. Variation in oxygen levels between 0.5 and 7%
has a relatively small effect on the efficacy of the inhibitors
however these compounds are, in general, more effective
at 21% O2 which appears to correlate with an increased
growth rate. We are currently assessing the effects of
these inhibitors in combination with various cytotoxic and
targeted therapies to assess how these might integrate with
established therapies.

Eagle Medium without HEPES modification (DMEM
31885–023, Invitrogen), including low glucose (5.56 mM),
sodium pyruvate (110 mg/L) and L-glutamine (3.97 mM).
The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were incubated
in a humidified incubator at 37oC with 5% CO2. They
were grown in T175cm3 culture flasks, until reaching
approximately 70–80% confluence, and were sub-cultured
as follows. Medium was removed and cells were washed
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Trypsin was used to
cause cell detachment. Medium containing serum was added
to neutralize the enzyme and cells were pelleted at 400G for
5min. Finally, cells were resuspended in media and passaged
into fresh flasks or dishes (ratio 1:10). When necessary,
cells were counted using a Neubauer hemocytometer.
All procedures were performed under sterile conditions
in a Laminar Air Flow hood. Hypoxia experiments were
conducted at 37oC with 5% CO2 and 7%, 2% or 0.5% O2
using the H35 Hypoxystation (Don Whitley Scientific,
Shipley, UK). Prior to hypoxia experiments, cells were
allowed to adapt to each oxygen level for at least 5 days.
Phloretin, Quercetin, 3BP, DCA and Oxamic acid
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. STF31 and Metformin
were obtained from Tocris Bioscience, WZB117 and 3PO
from Merck Millipore and NHI-1 from Mercachem. Stock
solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO except
for WZB117 which was dissolved in ethanol and DCA,
Oxamic acid, 3BP and Metformin in PBS.

Sulphorhodamine B assay (SRB)
The SRB assay is a cell density assay based on the
measurement of cellular protein content [60]. Cells (0.5 2x103 cells/well, depending on the proliferation rate of
each cell line) were seeded in 96-well plates. Forty-eight
hours later, cells were treated with or without the indicated
concentration of the inhibitors. A 10-point dilution series
with 1:2 steps in six replicates was performed. For the
compounds dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or
ethanol, a constant DMSO/ ethanol concentration was used
across the whole concentration- response curve. After a five
day incubation period, cell monolayers were fixed with cold
25% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) and stained with the SRB
dye solution (Sigma). Unbound excess dye was removed
by 1% acetic acid washes. The protein-bound stain was
solubilized in 10mM Tris buffer solution (pH 10.5). Finally
absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a microplate
reader (BP800, Biohit Health Care). Measurements were
corrected for background absorbance and presented as
percentage of absorbance in untreated cells
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was
used as a measure of the effectiveness of each compound.
It indicates the concentration needed to reduce cell number
by half. Sigmoidal concentration response curves were
fitted and the IC50 values were defined using the XL fit tool
within the Microsoft Excel.

A panel of eight cell lines was used; four breast
cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HBL100 and BT549)
and four ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR5, TOV112D,
OVCAR3, CAOV3). Key features of the cell lines are
summarised in Supplementary Table 1. All cell lines

For drug interaction studies a range of 7 different
concentrations of glycolytic inhibitors was used in
combination with a fixed concentration of metformin
(around the IC20). Both drugs were administered at the
same time and the SRB assay was performed after a three
day treatment. Data were analysed using the Calcusyn

each single combination point [61].

using the flow cytometer BD Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences).
Annexin V single positive cells were identified as early
apoptotic, while cells both Annexin V and PI positive were
identified as end stage apoptotic cells and PI positive cells
as necrotic.

Glucose uptake assay

Cells were seeded in cell culture dishes and, when
approximately 80% confluent, were washed with ice
cold PBS and then treated with ice cold isotonic lysis
buffer (50mM Tris pH7.5, 5 mM EGTA pH8.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 “Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablet” (Roche),
100 μl Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma), 100μl
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 3 (Sigma), 50 μl Aprotinin
(Sigma), 100 μl Triton-X 100 (Sigma)). Subsequently cells
were scraped and after centrifugation lysate supernatant
was collected and stored at -70oC. The Bicinchoninic
Acid Assay (BCA) was performed to determine lysate
protein concentration and absorbance was measured
at 540nm using a microplate reader. Sodium dodecyl
sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) was performed to separate proteins according
to their molecular weight. Following electrophoresis,
proteins were transferred onto a methanol-activated
Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) Transfer
Membrane (Immobilon) using the Bio-Rad Protean
Transfer Cell equipment. Transfer was performed at
100V for 1 h in ice-cold Tris-Glycine transfer buffer at
4oC. After transfer the membrane was blocked for 1 h at
RT, in 1:1 PBS/Odyssey Blocking Buffer to prevent nonspecific binding. Following blocking, the membrane was
incubated in primary antibody solution at 4oC overnight.
The following primary antibodies were used: GLUT1
(07-1401; Millipore), HKII (2867; CST), PFKFB3
(13123; CST), PDHK1 (3820; CST), LDHA (3582; CST)
and α-Tubulin (ab7291; Abcam). As antibody diluent,
PBS/Odyssey Blocking Buffer or 5%w/v bovine serum
albumin (BSA, Sigma) in 1X PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20 were used. After primary antibody incubation,
the membrane was washed with PBS-0.1% Tween 20, to
remove excess antibody. Secondary fluorescent antibody
(anti-rabbit IR Dye 800CW (926-32211; Odyssey) and
anti-mouse IR Dye 680LT (926-68020; Odyssey)) were
employed, raised against the species of the primary
antibody and diluted in PBS/Odyssey Blocking Buffer
containing 0.001% SDS. Incubation was performed for
45 min at room temperature, protected from light. Finally
the membrane was washed with PBS-0.1% Tween 20.
Visualization of proteins was achieved by scanning on
the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor). This
machine is equipped with two infrared channels for direct
fluorescence detection allowing two separate targets to be
probed simultaneously.

Western blotting

Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 x 105
to 2 x 105 cells per well. The following day, cells were
treated with or without the indicated concentration of
inhibitor. The concentrations used for each compound
were determined based on the corresponding IC50 values
derived from the SRB assays. Culture media was collected
at 24 h. Glucose remaining in the media was measured
using the Amplex Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Samples were diluted 1:50 in 1xReaction Buffer provided
in the kit. A 96-well plate format with triplicates was used.
After a 30 min incubation period with the reaction reagent
solution, protected from light, absorbance was measured at
540 nm using the microplate reader. Measurements were
corrected for background absorbance, subtracting the value
derived from the no-glucose control [62].

Lactate assay
Lactate was measured in the same samples as used
for the glucose assay, as described above. Lactate produced
in the media was measured using the Lactate Assay Kit
(Trinity Biotech), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A 96-well plate format with triplicates was
used. 2 μl of sample was added to the wells followed by
200 μl of lactate reagent. The reagent was used as a 50%
solution in distilled water. Plates were incubated in the dark
for 7 min and absorbance was measured at 540 nm using
the microplate reader. Measurements were corrected for
background absorbance, subtracting the value derived from
the no-lactate control [63].

Flow cytometry analysis
Detection of compound-induced cell death was
carried out by dual staining with FITC-conjugated Annexin
V and Propidium Iodide (PI) followed by flow cytometry.
Briefly, 3 x 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
the following day they were treated with or without the
indicated concentration of inhibitor. After a 48 h treatment,
cells were harvested and stained using the FITC Annexin
V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data acquisition and
analysis of 30,000 events for each sample was performed

induces apoptosis in H-Ras MCF10A human breast tumor
cells through the activation of p53 via JNK and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Ann NY Acad
Sci. 2009; 1171:479–483.

To evaluate the significance of differences between
treated samples and untreated controls, ANOVA followed
by the Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test was used.
To correlate the expression of the glycolytic enzymes in
the panel of the eight cancer cell lines with their sensitivity
to the inhibitors the non-Parametric Spearman correlation
test was performed. Statistical tests were undertaken using
GraphPad software.
