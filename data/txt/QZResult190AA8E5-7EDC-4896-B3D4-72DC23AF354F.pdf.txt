Abstract
Resistance of glioblastoma (GBM) to the front-line chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) continues to challenge
GBM treatment efforts. The repair of TMZ-induced DNA damage by O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
confers one mechanism of TMZ resistance. Paradoxically,
MGMT-deﬁcient GBM patients survive longer despite still
developing resistance to TMZ. Recent studies indicate that the
gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) renders GBM cells
resistant to TMZ through its carboxyl terminus (CT). In this
study, we report insights into how Cx43 promotes TMZ resistance. Cx43 levels were inversely correlated with TMZ sensitivity of GBM cells, including GBM stem cells. Moreover, Cx43

levels inversely correlated with patient survival, including
as observed in MGMT-deﬁcient GBM patients. Addition of the
C-terminal peptide mimetic aCT1, a selective inhibitor of Cx43
channels, sensitized human MGMT-deﬁcient and TMZ-resistant
GBM cells to TMZ treatment. Moreover, combining aCT1 with
TMZ-blocked AKT/mTOR signaling, induced autophagy and
apoptosis in TMZ-resistant GBM cells. Our ﬁndings suggest
that Cx43 may offer a biomarker to predict the survival of
patients with MGMT-independent TMZ resistance and that
combining a Cx43 inhibitor with TMZ could enhance therapeutic responses in GBM, and perhaps other TMZ-resistant
cancers. Cancer Res; 76(1); 139–49. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

that an increase of only 2.5 months represents a signiﬁcant
improvement in survival for GBM patients highlights the urgent
need for more efﬁcacious treatments.
TMZ is a DNA-alkylating agent that causes lethal DNA lesions in
fast-dividing cancer cells. This drug is widely used to treat primary,
as well as metastatic brain cancer. However, substantial resistance
typically develops to TMZ, and with this, the drug shows
decreased clinical efﬁcacy. Poor response to TMZ is often associated with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT),
an enzyme that repairs damage to DNA induced by TMZ.
Although a subset of patients without MGMT activity (often
resulting from methylation of the MGMT promoter) shows better
responsiveness to TMZ, relapse eventually develops (4). Thus,
brain cancer patients exhibit MGMT-dependent and -independent patterns of resistance to TMZ. Although MGMT-dependent
TMZ resistance is attributable to the presence of active MGMT, the
mechanisms underlying MGMT-independent resistance remain
to be elucidated. In addition, inhibiting MGMT failed to show
clinical beneﬁt for TMZ-refractory patients. Thus, new therapeutic
strategies that improve response to TMZ treatment regimes could
have a genuine impact on the clinical management of GBM.
Recently, a number of groups have reported several lines of
evidence that the gap junction protein Cx43 (also called gap
junction protein A1, GJA1) controls the response of GBM cells
to TMZ (5–8). First, Cx43 was found to be highly expressed in
GBM tissues compared with normal brain (7, 8). Second, overexpressing Cx43 in GBM cell lines rendered them resistant to TMZ
(7, 8). Third, genetic knockdown of Cx43 or an antibody against
Cx43 restored TMZ sensitivity (6–8). Finally, GBM cells expressing
a CT truncation of Cx43 recovered sensitivity to TMZ (8). Collectively, these results indicate that pharmacologic targeting of
Cx43 could help overcome TMZ resistance in some cell lines and
tumors.

In the central nervous system, glioblastoma (GBM) is the
most common malignancy, accounting for more than 45% of
all malignant brain tumors. The percentage of GBM patients
with 5-year survival after aggressive treatment is less than 5%,
ranking it the most lethal of all brain cancers and the sixth most
deadly of all types of malignancy (1). Standard of care for newly
diagnosed GBM includes maximum safe resection, followed by
ionizing radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide
(TMZ). However, even after extensive and aggressive surgical
resection of tumors, median survival is increased by only 2.5
months (from 12.1 to 14.6 months), with combined TMZ and
radiation therapy (2). Before the addition of TMZ to standard
of care in 2005, no improvement in survival from newly
diagnosed GBM had been achieved in decades despite numerous clinical trials on various new treatments (3). The grim fact

Murphy et al.

We have developed a Cx43 C-terminus (CT) mimetic peptidedubbed aCT1. aCT1 is a 25mer peptide comprising the ZO-1
PDZ-binding domain of Cx43 fused to an N-terminal antennapedia cell penetration sequence. This Cx43 CT mimetic was
originally designed as a tool to disrupt the interaction between
endogenous ZO-1 and Cx43 in studies of heart electrical conduction (9). Importantly, aCT1 has completed testing in phase II
clinical trials as a wound-healing drug, with no treatment-associated adverse events found in the more than 250 patients that
participated in these studies (10). In this report, we investigated
the relationship between Cx43 and MGMT-independent TMZ
resistance and patient survival. We also monitored the response
of GBM to aCT1 and TMZ, determining that this combinatorial
treatment results in a striking recovery in sensitivity to TMZ of
human GBM cells and tumors.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Reagents were as follows: aCT1 peptide was purchased from
the American Peptide Company. Lyophilized peptide powder
was reconstituted in 1 PBS (137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L
KCl, 10 mmol/L Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mmol/L KH2PO4) at a
concentration of 5 mmol/L. The Cyto-ID dye was purchased
from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. TMZ was purchased from Selleck
Chemicals LLC. TMZ was reconstituted in DMSO and then
aliquots were stored at 20 C freezer. The stock concentration
of TMZ is 50 mmol/L. Normal brain cell lysate was purchased
from Abcam.
GBM cell lines
Human GBM cell lines SF295, U87MG, A172, LN229, T98G,
SF-268, U251, SNB-75, LN-18 were maintained in DMEM (Life
Technologies Corporation) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlas
Biologicals, Inc.), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and penicillin (100
IU/mL). Human GBM stem cell (GSC) lines LN229/GSC and
GS9-6/NOTCH1þ cells were maintained as spheres in Neuralbasal media (Life Technologies Corporation) supplemented with
Gibco B-27 Supplements (Life Technologies Corporation), FGF
(ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd., 20 ng/mL), and EGF (ProSpecTany TechnoGene Ltd., 20 ng/mL). LN229/GSCs were grown as
spheres in ﬂasks coated with Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate;
Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC).
Isolation and preparation of primary GBM cells and GSCs
The use of human GBM patient specimens has been approved
by the Institutional Review Board at the Carilion Clinic. Freshly
resected human GBM tumors (pathologically conﬁrmed) were
minced into small pieces. Single cells were prepared using the
Papain cell dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) or Liberase (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturer's instructions. Red blood cells were removed using the
Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution purchased from Miltenyi Biotec Inc.
Isolated cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies Corporation) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlas Biologicals, Inc.),
streptomycin (100 mg/mL), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and 1 antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies Corporation). Primary
GBM cells were maintained at low passages.
GSCs were isolated and enriched using the sphere-formation
assay. Primary GBM cells were cultured in stem cell culture
media [DMEM or neurobasal media (Life Technologies Cor-

140 Cancer Res; 76(1) January 1, 2016

poration) supplemented with B-27 supplement (Life Technologies Corporation), 20 ng/mL FGF-2 (Genscript), and 20
ng/mL EGF (Genscript)]. Isolated GSCs grew as spheres after
1 to 2 months of continuous culturing. GSCs were tested for
their capability to self-renew using the sphere-formation assay
described below.
Immunoblotting and quantiﬁcation of band intensity
Immunoblotting was performed as described in our previous
reports (11). In brief, cells were lysed and total protein was
quantiﬁed using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.).
An equal amount of total protein (20–25 mg) in each sample was
loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. After transferring to PVDF membrane, the blot was incubated with antibodies. Antibodies were
diluted as follows: anti-Cx43 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., 1:4000), antiMGMT (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:300), anti–b-actin (SigmaAldrich Co. LLC, 1:10000), anti–phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:1000), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology,
1:1000), anti–phospho-AMPKa (Cell Signaling Technology,
1:1000), anti-AMPKa (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000),
anti–phospho-MTOR (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000),
anti-MTOR (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), anti-GFAP (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:500), anti-NOTCH1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., 1:1000), and anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., 1:5000). Images were taken using a ChemiDoc MP System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). The intensity of the band was quantiﬁed using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) or
ImageJ as described earlier (11). The relative level of Cx43 proteins
(Cx43/ACTB) is deﬁned as the ratio of band intensity of Cx43 to
that of b-actin.
Viability assays
Viability assays were described previously (12). Cells (5  102
or 2.5  103) were plated in a 96-well plate or a 24-well plate,
respectively. Cells were then treated with vehicle (DMSO), TMZ
(25–400 mmol/L) once, aCT1 (50–100 mmol/L) every second day
X 3 doses, or a combination of TMZ and aCT1. After one week,
cell viability was monitored using the following assays: MTS or
Trypan blue exclusion. In MTS assay, 10 mL MTS (Promega) was
added to each well, then incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. The
absorbance at 490 nm was measured using the FilterMax F3
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, LLC) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Percent cell viability was obtained
by dividing the absorbance of treatment groups to those of
untreated groups. In the Trypan blue exclusion assay, cells were
trypsinized and stained with Trypan blue. Trypan blue-negative
cells (viable) were counted using a hemocytometer. The percentage of viable cells was deﬁned as the ratio of cell number in the
treatment group to that of the control group. TMZ IC50s were
calculated using the GraphPad Prism software.
Kaplan–Meier analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas gene
expression data
Clinical variables of GBM patients, such as survival time and
vital status, were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Gene
expression data, including for GBM patients (AglientG450A_07;
Aglient 244K custom gene expression and HuEx-1_0-st-v2; Affymetrix human exon 1.0 ST array), was downloaded from the Pancancer project (syn1461183) on Synapse (http://www.synapse.

Sphere-formation assay
Sphere-formation assays were performed as described earlier
(13). Brieﬂy, GSCs (50 cells per well) were plated in a 96-well
plate. Cells were then treated as described above. Two to three
weeks later, the numbers of wells with spheres were counted. The
percentage of wells with spheres was deﬁned as the ratio of wells
with spheres to wells initially plated.

Caspase-3/7 activity assay
The caspase-3/7 activity assay has been described previously
(13). In brief, cells were plated in a 96-well plate and treated with
drugs as described above. The activity of caspase-3/7 was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) based on
manufacturer's instructions. The fold change of caspase-3/7 activity was deﬁned as the ratio of caspase-3/7 luminescence in the

were then divided: one-half for the measurement of Cyto-ID; the
other half for the MTS cell viability assay as described above. In
some experiments, cell number was determined by the CellTiterBlue assay (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions.
The Cyto-ID ﬂuorescence was read at excitation 480 nm and

and (iv) TMZ and aCT1. The treatment regimen was as follows:
aCT1 peptide (100 mg/kg/day) was administered via intratumoral injection on days 1 and 2 then every second day thereafter. TMZ (7.5 mg/kg/day) was administered by intraperitoneal injection every second day starting on day 2. For the
groups 1–3, the vehicle DMSO or 1 PBS was used accordingly.
This treatment regimen continued for 2 weeks. The tumor sizes
were measured every other day using a caliper. Tumor volume
was calculated ((length  width2)/2).
Statistical analyses
The Student t test and the one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc
test for multiple comparisons were used for statistical analyses.
These tests were done using the SPSS software.

Results
Cx43 expression level inversely correlates with TMZ sensitivity
in MGMT-deﬁcient GBM cells
How Cx43 governs TMZ resistance remains elusive. To further
understand the mechanism of Cx43-mediated TMZ resistance, we
ﬁrst monitored the TMZ sensitivity of a rat malignant glioma cell
line C6 that ectopically expresses Cx43. Consistent with previous
reports (7, 8), C6 cells with exogenous Cx43 became resistant to
TMZ (Fig. 1A). We then investigated the relationship between
Cx43 expression and MGMT-independent TMZ resistance in
human GBM cell lines. Previous studies had indicated that MGMT
was expressed in the T98G or LN-18 cell lines only, but absent in
SF295, U87MG, A172, LN229, SF-268, U251, and SNB-75 cells
(Fig. 1B; refs. 14–18). We found that of the MGMT-negative GBM
cell lines, Cx43 was highly expressed in SF295 and U87MG cells
(highlighted in red, Fig. 1C). Intriguingly, the reported TMZ IC50s
of SF295 and U87MG cells was remarkably higher than those of
the other GBM cell lines (Fig. 1D). As we could not ﬁnd it
documented in the literature, we assayed the TMZ IC50 of SNB75

cells and determined it to be 293 mmol/L (Fig. 1E). To validate
TMZ sensitivities reported previously for other GBM cell lines,
we treated U87MG, SF295, SF268, and U251 cells with different doses of TMZ. The IC50s of above cell lines were 1369, 513,
274, and 129 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1F), Although SF268
and U251 cells were less sensitive to TMZ in our hands, the
difference in TMZ responsiveness among these GBM cell lines
was more or less in line with those measured by earlier workers
(see Fig. 1 for these references). Regression analysis of Cx43 and
TMZ IC50s in MGMT-deﬁcient cell lines demonstrated that
there was a strong relationship between TMZ responsiveness
and Cx43 levels (Fig. 1G; refs. 14–16). Consistent with this trend,
the high Cx43-expressing lines SF295 and U87MG showed the
lowest cytotoxicity when treated with 100 mmol/L of TMZ for
3 days (Fig. 1H) and there was a strong correlation between
TMZ-induced reduction in cell viability and levels of Cx43
expressed (Fig. 1I).
We next examined Cx43 expression and TMZ responses in GBM
primary cells from freshly resected patient tumors. The levels of
Cx43 in all GBM patient samples were approximately 6- to 14-fold
higher than that in the normal brain (Fig. 2A), consistent with the
results from The Protein Atlas database (Fig. 2C and D). Among all
six primary GBM cells, only VTC-003 cells expressed no MGMT
(Fig. 2B). The ratio of Cx43 to ACTB in VTC-003 cells was
equivalent to that in SF295 cells (Figs. 1C and 2A). As expected,
VTC-003 exhibited signiﬁcant resistance to TMZ (Fig. 2E) with an
IC50 of approximately 3 mmol/L.

aCT1, a Cx43 mimetic peptide, sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ
aCT1 is a mimetic of the Cx43 CT (Fig. 4A) that selectively
inhibits Cx43 hemichannel (HC) activity via a mechanism involving a competitive interaction with ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1)—a
PDZ (Post synaptic density, Disks-large, Zonula occludens-1)–
containing protein (9). In light of recent ﬁndings that Cx43 CT
may control TMZ drug resistance (7, 8), we sought to determine
whether aCT1 restored drug sensitivity in MGMT-deﬁcient GBM
cells. Tumor cells were treated with aCT1, TMZ, or a combination
of both these drugs. In MGMTdeﬁcient and Cx43high cells including

1_0-st-v2 (Exon array, 437 patients) were used. We ﬁrst divided
patient samples from the TCGA database into two groups:
MGMTlow and MGMThigh based on mRNA levels. In the MGMTlow
group, patients with high levels of GJA1 mRNA (GJA1high) had a
signiﬁcantly shorter life span than those with low levels of GJA1
mRNA (GJA1low; Fig. 3A and B, P < or ¼ 0.05). In contrast, there
was no signiﬁcant difference between GJA1high and GJA1low
patients in the MGMThigh group (Fig. 3C and D; P > 0.05). These
results strongly infer that Cx43 expression levels inversely correlate with the prognosis of MGMT-deﬁcient GBM patients.

Cx43 and TMZ in GBM

SF-295, U87MG, and VTC-003, the combination of aCT1 and
TMZ resulted in a marked and synergistic reduction of cell viability
compared with each treatment alone (Fig. 4B–D). In contrast, the
combinational treatment failed to signiﬁcantly induce a synergistic growth inhibition in MGMTdeﬁcient and Cx43low LN229 (Fig.
4E) or U251 (Fig. 4F) cells. Primary GBM cells VTC-037 and VTC005 that expressed low levels of MGMT (Fig. 2B) also responded
to the combination of aCT1 and TMZ (Fig. 4G and H). VTC-005
cells express 2-fold lower levels of Cx43 than VTC-037 (Fig. 2A).
Intriguingly, the response of VTC-005 cells to TMZ was also less
efﬁcient than that of VTC-037. Together, our results indicate that
inhibition of Cx43 channels substantially reduced TMZ resistance
in MGMT-deﬁcient GBM cells and that this effect was strongly
related to the level of Cx43 expressed by patient cells.

GSCs are also resistant to current therapies including TMZ (20).
Although this resistance may involve different mechanisms, we
postulated that Cx43 might also render GSCs resistant to TMZ. To
test this, we isolated and enriched GSCs from LN229 cells
(LN229/GSC). Compared with parental LN229 cells, LN229/
GSCs showed a loss of GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, an
astrocyte marker) and enrichment of the GSC marker NOTCH1
(Notch homolog 1; Fig. 5A; ref. 21). Notably, the level of Cx43
was increased in LN229/GSCs compared with the parental
LN229 line (Fig. 5B). We further conﬁrmed that another TMZresistant GSC line GS9-6/NOTCH1þ (Fig. 5C; refs. 21, 22) also
expressed elevated levels of Cx43 (Fig. 5B). Both LN229/GSC and
GS9-6/NOTCH1þ stem cell lines were also found to be MGMT
deﬁcient (Fig. 5B). In addition, we isolated and enriched GSC
lines VTC-036/GSC, VTC-061/GSC, and VTC-064/GSC directly
from freshly resected human GBM patient tissues. We found
that an MGMT-negative VTC-064/GSC line expressed a high level
of Cx43 (Fig. 5C and D), equivalent to that of LN229/GSCs
(Fig. 5B). We next determined the sensitivity of these GSCs
to TMZ. Compared with the parental LN229 cells, LN229/GSCs
were signiﬁcantly less sensitive to TMZ (Fig. 5F, 8.3% vs. 46.3%).

Glioblastoma stem cells express high levels of Cx43 and are
resistant to TMZ
Because GSCs are highly tumorigenic, it has been suggested that
GSCs are the prime cause of GBM tumor recurrence (19). Thus,
targeting GSCs is an appealing therapeutic approach for GBM.

aCT1 blocks the AKT/AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway and
induces autophagy and apoptosis
Connexin HC activity has been shown to be critical for the
activation of AKT/AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway (23). In this
pathway, AKT (protein kinase B) suppresses AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and, in turn, blocks the inhibition of MTOR by
AMPK, leading to MTOR activation. As aCT1 selectively inhibits
the activity of Cx43 HCs (24), we hypothesized that this peptide
targeted the AKT/AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway. In the nine
GBM cell lines, AKT and MTOR were active in the high Cx43expressing SF295 and U87MG, but not in the other GBM lines,
coinciding with inactivation of AMPKa (an active subunit of
AMPK complex; Fig. 7A). To compare the effect of aCT1 on
AKT/AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway in cells with different levels
of Cx43 and responsiveness to TMZ, we treated LN229 (Cx43low/
TMZsensitive) and LN229/GSCs (Cx43high/TMZresistant) with aCT1
and/or TMZ. Although aCT1 alone blocked AKT, activated
AMPKa, and inactivated MTOR in LN229/GSCs, it did not do
so in parental LN229 cells (Fig. 7B). Of note, TMZ alone had no

GS9-6/NOTCH1þ cells also proved resistant to TMZ, displaying
drug sensitivity equivalent to the TMZ-resistant U87MG cell
line (Fig. 5E). Importantly, differentiation of LN229/GSCs or
GSC9-6/NOTCH1þ cells into mature GBM lineages resulted in
a rescue of TMZ sensitivity (Fig. 5F and G). Taken together,
these data indicated that GSCs express high levels of Cx43 and
are resistant to TMZ.
aCT1 sensitizes GSCs to TMZ
We then asked whether aCT1 restores GSCs' sensitivity to TMZ.
As expected, the combination of aCT1 and TMZ, but neither
treatment alone, blocked the sphere formation of GS9-6/
NOTCH1þ cells (Fig. 6A and B), LN229/GSCs (Fig. 6C), and
VTC-064/GSCs (Fig. 6D). The cell viability of LN229/GSCs was
also signiﬁcantly reduced by the combinational aCT1/TMZ treatment (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, aCT1 and TMZ (red line) together
substantially blocked the growth of human-derived LN229/GSC
tumors in mice (Fig. 6F). These data indicate that aCT1 circumvents TMZ resistance of GSCs both in vitro and in vivo.

inﬂuence on this signaling pathway, suggesting that the inactivation of AKT/AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway by aCT1 may sensitize GBM cells to TMZ-induced growth inhibition. Given the
important role of AKT/MTOR in autophagy and apoptosis, we
hypothesized that the combination of aCT1 and TMZ synergistically activated autophagy and/or apoptosis. Consistent with
this, it was determined that cotreatment of LN229/GSCs with
aCT1 and TMZ synergistically induced autophagy (Fig. 7C) and
apoptosis (Fig. 7D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that
aCT1 blocks the AKT/AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway and
induces autophagy and apoptosis.

Discussion
A novel paradigm is proposed for development of resistance of
MGMT-deﬁcient GBM patients to TMZ (Fig. 7E). In MGMTdeﬁcient GBM cells, Cx43 activates AKT followed by inactivation
of AMPK and activation of MTOR signaling. This leads to suppression of cell death. Thus, these MGMT-deﬁcient GBM cells are
TMZ resistant. On the other hand, aCT1, a selective inhibitor of

Cx43 channel activity, blunts this process, and sensitizes MGMTdeﬁcient GBM cells to TMZ-induced cell death. Hence, these
MGMT-deﬁcient GBM cells become sensitive to TMZ. This new
paradigm demonstrates the potentially important role of Cx43 in
sensitivity to the anticancer drug TMZ. Our results presented
herein also offer possible options for the diagnosis and treatment
of TMZ-resistant GBM.
The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that Cx43 is an adverse
prognostic marker for MGMT-deﬁcient GBM. Our further work,
presented in Figs. 4 and 5, reveals an important role of Cx43 in
TMZ resistance in MGMT-deﬁcient GBM cells. The reciprocal
expression pattern of Cx43 and MGMT in GBM cells as well as
the resensitization of GBM cells to TMZ by a Cx43 inhibitor
strongly suggest that a high level of Cx43 contributes to
MGMT-independent TMZ resistance. MGMT repairs DNA damage
caused by TMZ; however, GBM patients with no or low levels of
MGMT still become tolerant to TMZ (4). Thus, our work identiﬁes
a novel mechanism underlying TMZ resistance in MGMT-deﬁcient GBM patients. The molecular pathway presented in Fig. 7E,
left, further explains how Cx43 renders MGMT-deﬁcient GBM

patients TMZ resistance. Taken together, our ﬁndings are of
potential signiﬁcance as they indicate path to new therapies
involving the targeting of Cx43 that could be applied to
MGMT-deﬁcient/Cx43-high GBM patients.
Our results demonstrate that the combination of aCT1 and
TMZ likely induces cell death through attenuating the activity of
AKT/MTOR signaling pathway. However, the speciﬁc mechanism
by which aCT1 acts on this signaling pathway remains to be
elucidated. It has been recently determined that a prime site of
action of aCT1 is in the perinexus, where the peptide uncoupled
Cx43 from ZO-1 and prompted transition of undocked HCs into
the gap junction (GJ; ref. 24). The sequestration of HCs into GJs
induced by aCT1 resulted in decreased in HC activity, while
maintaining GJ coupling. The mechanistic ability to selectively
inhibit HC activity, without decreasing GJ coupling represents an
important difference between aCT1 and other blockers of Cx43
function. This includes Cx43 antisense and the widely used Gap26
and Gap27 peptides, mimetics of the Cx43 extracellular loop
domain, all of which inhibit Cx43 HC and GJ channel functions
indiscriminately (25, 26). The targeted action of aCT1 on HCs
may explain the altered activity of AKT/MTOR signaling, as HCs in
normal or malignant glial cells provide pathways for escalated
release of ATP and glutamate (27, 28). Glutamate exhibits its
progrowth activity through activating the downstream signaling
pathways such as PI3K or MAPK, both of which have been
implicated in GBM pathogenesis (28).
Inhibition of Cx43 channel activity by aCT1 was found to
enhance healing rates of two chronic wound types, diabetic foot
and venous leg ulcers (10). Speciﬁcally, in multicenter phase II
testing involving more than 250 patients, aCT1 signiﬁcantly
increased healing rates halving the time-to-closure of both chronic
wound types (10). These clinical tests represented the ﬁrst reports
of a randomized trial of a connexin-targeting therapeutic in
humans. Importantly with respect to the current study, no adverse
events were associated with repeated exposure to aCT1 over the
12-week time course of either the venous leg or diabetic foot ulcer
trials, including no detection of antibodies against aCT1 in
patient sera (10). The safety of Cx43 antisense, Gap26/27 peptides
or other nonselective approaches, which nonselectively block
both HC and GJ functions of Cx43, has yet to be determined in
humans. The preclinical studies shown in this report and the fact
that aCT1 has been used in clinical trials for human patients with
chronic wounds highlight the importance of the potential clinical
application of aCT1 and TMZ combination for GBM patients,
based on our ﬁnding that aCT1 sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ.

Our ﬁndings also have implications in treating other cancers, as
TMZ has been used as a single agent or in combination with other
cancer treatments in different types of cancer including pediatric
solid tumors (i.e., medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, hepatocarcinoma, etc.) and brain metastases from breast or
lung cancer (29, 30). There are several ongoing clinical trials in
which TMZ is used as a single agent to treat melanoma (31) and
small cell lung cancer (32). Hence, a combined TMZ and Cx43
inhibitory treatment could provide a new and effective therapy for
GBM and other cancers.
