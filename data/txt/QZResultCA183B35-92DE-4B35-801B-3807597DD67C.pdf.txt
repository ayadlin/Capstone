BACKGROUND: The European LeukemiaNet recommendations for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) defined
a group of patients with suboptimal response to imatinib. The significance of this response was not well
defined. METHODS: The significance of having had a suboptimal response during imatinib therapy among
281 patients with CML treated with standard-dose (n ¼ 73) or high-dose (n ¼ 208) imatinib was investigated. RESULTS: Rates of suboptimal response at 6, 12, and 18 months were 4%, 8%, and 40%, respectively,
and were not influenced by Sokal risk score. Patients with a suboptimal response at 6 months had a significantly lower probability of eventually achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) compared with
those with an optimal response (30% vs 97%; P < .001), and their event-free survival (EFS) and transformation-free survival (TFS) were found to be similar to those with criteria for failure at this time point. Suboptimal response at 12 months defined a group with a similar TFS as those with optimal response, but with
worse EFS. In contrast, patients with a suboptimal response at 18 months had outcomes that were similar
to those patients with an optimal response. A multivariate analysis confirmed the significance of response
category after adjusting for pretreatment characteristics and imatinib dose. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
the current study suggested that suboptimal response was a heterogeneous category, and some patients
had an outcome that mirrored that of patients with failed therapy. Interventions aimed at improving this

Imatinib is currently standard therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in early
chronic phase. The most recent update of the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571
(IRIS) trial demonstrated that 82% of patients achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), with most

responses being durable.1 After 6 years of follow-up, the
event-free survival rate is 83%, and that for survival free
from transformation is 93%. Despite these favorable
results, there is a subset of patients who do not achieve the
optimal response and may eventually require additional
therapy. A panel of experts, on behalf of the European
LeukemiaNet (ELN), recently proposed definitions for
the criteria of what is considered failure to therapy.2 These
definitions became particularly relevant as new tyrosine
kinase inhibitors were developed for the treatment of
patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib therapy.
Two of these agents, nilotinib and dasatinib, have demonstrated efficacy in the management of patients who meet
these definitions of failure after imatinib therapy.3,4 In
addition, the ELN recognized the presence of a group of
patients with a response that the group considered suboptimal. Similar to the definition for failure, the definition
for suboptimal response was based on the level of response
achieved at different time points. Patients with suboptimal response were described as a group of patients who
could still derive substantial benefit from continuing therapy with imatinib, but it was noted that the long-term
outcome of such treatment was not likely to be as favorable as in responders at the same time point.2 However,
the long-term outcome of patients who meet these definitions of suboptimal response is not yet well known.
Thus, we conducted an analysis of patients receiving
imatinib as initial therapy for early chronic-phase CML to
determine the frequency with which suboptimal response
occurs and the long-term outcome of patients with such
response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From July, 2000 through July, 2005, 281 patients with
Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome positive CML were
included in 4 consecutive clinical trials for the treatment
of early chronic-phase CML with imatinib. Among these,
73 were treated with a starting dose of 400 mg daily,
including 23 patients who were treated as part of a larger
multicenter trial (IRIS)5 and 50 patients who were treated
in a single-institution phase 2, single-arm study.6 An additional 208 patients received imatinib at a starting daily
dose of 800 mg as part of 2 consecutive trials: 114 were
treated in a single-institution, phase 2 trial7 and 94 were
treated in a randomized phase 2 trial in which all patients

were treated with a starting daily dose of imatinib of
800 mg; after 6 months, patients were randomized to
continue high-dose imatinib alone or in combination
with pegylated interferon-a and sargramostim.8 The
preliminary results of the latter study suggested no
difference in overall response, event-free survival (EFS),
transformation-free survival (TFS), or overall survival
(OS), and therefore both arms were included in this
analysis together with patients treated with high-dose
imatinib alone.
The eligibility criteria for all these studies were similar and included chronic-phase CML within 12 months
from the time of the initial diagnosis and no prior therapy
for CML (a maximum of 30 days of prior therapy with
interferon-a, or imatinib for patients treated with highdose imatinib, was allowed in the 3 single-institution trials). In addition, patients were required to be aged >15
years, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and normal organ function. All
patients were enrolled in protocols approved by the institutional review board (IRB) and registered in clinicaltrials.gov, and signed an informed consent approved by
the IRB.
Follow-up was similar in all studies and included a
history and physical examination, complete blood counts
and blood chemistry at the initiation of therapy and every
month for the first 3 months, then every 3 months until
12 months from the start of therapy, and then every 12
months. Cytogenetic response was assessed by G-banding
karyotype assessed in the bone marrow with at least 20
metaphases counted. Molecular response was assessed by
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Both the cytogenetic and molecular response
assessments were performed at baseline, every 3 months
for the first 12 months, and then every 6 months.
Response criteria were as previously described.7 A
complete hematologic response (CHR) was defined as a
white blood cell count <10  109/L, a platelet count
<450  109/L, no immature cells (blasts, promyelocytes,
or myelocytes) in the peripheral blood, and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to leukemia
(including palpable splenomegaly). CHR was further
categorized by the best cytogenetic response as CCyR (0%
Ph positive), partial (PCyR; 1%-35% Ph positive), and
minor (36%-90% Ph positive). A major cytogenetic
response (MCyR) included CCyR plus PCyR (ie, 35%

Ph positive). A major molecular response (MMR) was
defined as a 3-log reduction in transcript levels from the
baseline value established for untreated patients at our
institution by real-time, TaqMan-based, quantitative
PCR performed in peripheral blood samples. A complete
molecular response (CMR) was defined as undetectable
levels of BCR-ABL with a level of detection of at least
4.5 logs.9
Patients were classified as having failure or having a
suboptimal response according to the definitions proposed by the ELN.2 We identified no patients with a suboptimal response at 3 months; therefore, we considered
only responses at 6, 12, and 18 months. Briefly, a suboptimal response is defined when there is less than a PCyR 6
months from the time of the initiation of therapy, less
than a CCyR at 12 months, and less than an MMR at 18
months from the initiation of therapy. Failure is defined
as less than a CHR or no cytogenetic response at 6
months, less than a PCyR at 12 months, and less than a
CCyR at 18 months (Table 1). For the purposes of this
analysis, patients not having failure or a suboptimal
response were classified as having an ‘optimal’ response.

Statistical Analysis
The rates of suboptimal response and failure at each time
point were calculated among evaluable patients, that is,
those patients still receiving therapy and with an evaluable
hematologic, cytogenetic, and/or molecular result as
appropriate to determine the response at the specified
time point to be classified according to the ELN. EFS was
measured from the initiation of imatinib therapy (overall)
or from the time response was assessed (landmark analysis
for responses at 3, 6, and 12 months) until loss of CHR or
MCyR, progression to the accelerated or blastic phases of
CML, or death from any cause during treatment. TFS
was measured from the initiation of therapy (overall) or
from the times of interest (landmark analysis) until progression to the accelerated or blast phases of CML or
death from any cause during treatment. OS was defined
from the initiation of therapy (overall) or from the times
of interest (landmark analysis) to the date of death or last
follow-up. Survival probabilities were estimated with the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank
test.10 Cox multivariate analysis was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics to define the independCancer

and TFS. Differences among variables were evaluated
using the chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test for
categorical and continuous variables, respectively.11

RESULTS
A total of 281 patients were treated and followed for a median of 52 months (range, 2 months-90 months). Approximately 7% of patients had received prior interferon
(n ¼ 4) or imatinib (n ¼ 16) for <30 days as allowed per
inclusion criteria. The majority (65%) of patients were in
the Sokal low-risk category (Table 2). Patient characteristics were found to be similar between the cohorts treated
with standard or high-dose imatinib. Overall, 261 (93%)
patients achieved a MCyR, including 246 (88%) who
achieved a CCyR. Among the 246 patients who achieved
a CCyR at any time, 19 (8%) had lost such a response at
the time of last follow-up. In addition, among 270
patients who had PCR testing performed after the initiation of treatment, 188 (70%) achieved an MMR including 103 (38%) with CMR. A total of 42 (15%) patients
experienced events as defined for EFS, with 21 (7%) experiencing transformation to accelerated (n ¼ 9) or blast
(n ¼ 5) phase, and 7 dying of a non-CML–related cause.
The 4-year EFS, TFS, and OS rates for the whole group
were 88%, 93%, and 98%, respectively.
At 6 months from the initiation of therapy, 10 (4%;
6 with low-risk Sokal score, 3 with an intermediate score,
and 1 with a high-risk score) of 261 evaluable patients met
the definition of suboptimal response (ie, less than a
MCyR) and 9 (3%) had failure (ie, no CHR or no cytogenetic response). By 12 months, 19 (8%; 13 with a lowrisk Sokal score, 5 with an intermediate score, and 1 with

a high-risk score) of 247 evaluable patients had a suboptimal response (ie, less than a CCyR) and 14 (6%) met the
definition for failure (ie, less than MCyR). By 18 months,
the percentage of patients with a suboptimal response (ie,
less than MMR) increased to 40% (61 patients with a
low-risk Sokal score, 26 with an intermediate score, and 4
with a high-risk score), and 9% met criteria for failure (ie,
less than CCyR). At both the 6-month and 12-month
marks, the probability of having either a suboptimal
response or failure was greater for patients treated with
standard-dose imatinib (Table 3). However, it is interesting to note that by 18 months there was a trend toward a
higher rate of suboptimal responses noted among evaluable patients treated with the 800-mg dose of imatinib
but a significantly lower rate of failures among this cohort.
However, by this time, 21 (29%) patients in the standard3712

dose group had already discontinued imatinib therapy
because of resistance or intolerance compared with 42
(20%) in the high-dose imatinib cohort (including 7
[3%] patients who died due to non-CML causes). The
probability of having suboptimal response at any given
time was similar for all Sokal risk groups.
We also analyzed the EFS and TFS rates according
to the response at each time point. For this purpose, we
grouped patients from the standard-dose and high-dose
cohorts together. According to the response at 6 months,
as expected, patients meeting the definition of failure were
found to have a significantly worse EFS than those with
an optimal response (4-year EFS rate of 27% vs 93%; P <
.0001) (Fig. 1a). Of interest, the EFS for patients with a
suboptimal response (4-year probability 45%) was found
to be more similar to that of patients with failure than

patients with an optimal response. Similarly, the 4-year
TFS for patients with either failure (78%) or a suboptimal
response (60%) was significantly worse than that of
patients with an optimal response (95%) (P < .0001)
(Fig. 1b). According to the response at 12 months,
patients with failure have significantly worse EFS (4-year
rate of 29%) and TFS (4-year rate of 62%) compared
with patients with an optimal response (4-year EFS rate of
96%, and 4-year TFS rate of 96%). In contrast, patients
with a suboptimal response have demonstrated a trend toward inferior EFS (4-year rate of 87%) compared with
patients with an optimal response, but a similar TFS (4year rate of 93%) (Figs. 2a and 2b). A similar distribution
was observed based on the response by 18 months (Figs.
3a and 3b).
The population analyzed in the current study was
heterogeneous with regard to their pretreatment characteristics and the dose used. We thus performed a multivariate analysis to investigate whether the significance of
suboptimal response was independent of these factors.
According to response at 6 months, multivariate analysis
confirmed that patients with a suboptimal response had a
similar inferior outcome as those with failure compared
with those with an optimal response (hazards ratio [HR],
3.2 and 3.4, respectively; P < .001 for both). At 12
months, patients with a suboptimal response had a significantly worse EFS than patients with an optimal response
(HR, 2.1; P ¼ .005) but better than patients with failure
(HR failure vs optimal response, 4.1; P < .001).

According to response by 18 months, patients with a suboptimal response had a similar outcome as those with an

had a significantly worse EFS (HR, 4.0; P < .001).
Table 4 summarizes the probability of eventually
achieving a CCyR or MMR (when applicable) according
to the response category at each time point, as well as the
probability of eventually having an event or transforming
to the accelerated or blast phase. None of the patients with
a suboptimal response at 6 months eventually achieved an
MMR, and only 30% obtained a CCyR. This, as well as
the probability of eventually having an event or transforming to the accelerated or blast phase, mirrors the
prognosis of patients with failure at 6 months. According
to the response at 12 months, although 72% of patients

with a suboptimal response at this time eventually
achieved a CCyR, only 39% eventually achieved an
MMR (compared with 82% for patients with an optimal
response but no MMR yet for patients with failure). This
results in a rate of transformation that is similarly low as
that for patients with an optimal response, but a higher
probability of events. Based on the response at 18 months,
patients with a suboptimal response still had a 66% probability of eventually achieving an MMR compared with
10% for patients with failure. Patients with suboptimal
response had lower rates of transformation (5%) and
events (10%) than those with failure.
We then analyzed the probability of patients with a
suboptimal response be reclassified to a different category
(optimal or suboptimal) at subsequent time points. As

shown in Figure 4a, none of the 10 patients with a suboptimal response at 6 months had a therapeutic intervention
at the time. None of these patients improved to an optimal response 6 months later (ie, at 12 months from the
initiation of therapy), whereas 3 maintained a suboptimal
response and 6 worsened to failure by 12 months (1 was
not evaluable for response at 12 months). Similarly (Fig.
4b), of the 19 patients with a suboptimal response at 12
months, 4 improved to optimal by 18 months, 5 maintained a suboptimal response, 8 worsened to failure by 18
months, 1 was not evaluable, and 1 was lost to follow-up.
There were no treatment changes in any of these patients
during this period (ie, from 12 months to 18 months). Of
the 5 patients still with suboptimal response at 18 months,
2 remained in CCyR with no MMR, 2 improved to
MMR (n ¼ 1) or CMR (n ¼ 1), and 1 failed because of
noncompliance. Of the 8 patients catalogued as failure at
18 months, 3 lost a PCyR and regained it after a dose
increase, 1 later achieved CCyR (at 33 months), and 4
patients changed therapy because of failure.

DISCUSSION
The recommendations from the ELN have been very useful in harmonizing the definitions and treatment patterns
for patients with CML. With the advent of new treatment
options for patients who may develop resistance or intolerance to initial therapy with imatinib, 1 important need
was to establish clear and uniform definitions of what constitutes failure to therapy in which a change of therapy
Cancer

August 15, 2009

may be indicated. In doing so, the ELN also proposed definitions for a group of patients considered to have a suboptimal response. In the words of this group of experts,
suboptimal response indicates that the patient still may
receive substantial benefit from continuing therapy with
imatinib but, because the long-term outcome is not likely
to be optimal, the patient is eligible for other treatments.

These definitions were based on the available information
at the time, mostly from the IRIS study. Because the ELN
recommendation is widely used throughout the world in
guiding the management of patients with CML, we
explored the prognostic significance of having a suboptimal response and how this may differ from having an
optimal response or a failure.
The results of the current study suggest that indeed,
patients with a suboptimal response represent a distinct
category of patents with an outcome that is different (generally worse) than that of patients with an optimal
response. However, we also demonstrated that patients
with a suboptimal response represent a heterogeneous
group of patients in whom the prognostic implications are
different, depending on the time when a suboptimal
response is determined. Thus, patients determined to
have a suboptimal response at 6 months have a poor prognosis that is more similar to that of patients who already
met criteria for failure than to patients with an optimal
response. For example, the probability of transformation
at any time in the future was 30% for patients with a suboptimal response at 6 months, compared with 22% for
patients with failure and 6% for those with an optimal
response. In contrast, patients deemed to have a suboptimal response based on the 12-month assessment have an
outcome that is closer to that of patients with an optimal
response, with a similar TFS, although with a lower probability of MMR and an increased probability of developing an event over the course of therapy. By 18 months,
patients categorized as having a suboptimal response have
an outcome that nearly overlaps with that of patients with
an optimal response, similar to what has been reported
from the IRIS study.12
The current analysis also suggests that the use of
higher dose imatinib as initial therapy may decrease the
probability of having a suboptimal response or failure at 6
months and 12 months. This is in accordance with the
more rapid responses reported with high-dose imatinib in
several studies.7,13-16 Reducing the rate of suboptimal
responses at the earliest time points, when they appear to
have the most adverse prognostic implications (eg, from
11% with standard dose therapy to 1% with high dose
therapy at 6 months in this analysis), could potentially
result in an improved long-term outcome. Comparison
with historical controls suggests that this might be the
case,17 but ongoing randomized trials comparing stand3716

ard-dose versus high-dose imatinib will more definitively
answer this question.
There are some important considerations that need
to be taken into account in interpreting the results of the
current study. First, they constitute a retrospective analysis
of patients treated prospectively in clinical trials. In addition, patients who had received up to a maximum of 30
days of therapy with interferon or imatinib were allowed
in these trials. Thus, the timing of the response may be off
with respect to those used in the ELN recommendations
and the rate of suboptimal responses might be underestimated. However, exposure to prior therapy (particularly
imatinib) was minimal and occurred in only a minority of
patients. Finally, we included patients treated with either
standard-dose or high-dose imatinib. The definitions
from the ELN were specifically designed for patients
treated with standard-dose imatinib. Other than the difference in the rate of suboptimal responses and failures at
some time points, we identified no differences in the significance of such responses by the dose used. In a multivariate analysis, the significance of response was
maintained after adjusting for dose as well as pretreatment
characteristics such as Sokal score. As new treatment
modalities are being investigated as initial therapy for
CML in early chronic phase (such as high-dose imatinib,7,14 nilotinib,18 and dasatinib19) it becomes important to consider these definitions beyond standard-dose
imatinib. The results of the current study suggest these
definitions apply (with acknowledgment of the heterogeneity mentioned earlier) to patients treated with both
standard-dose and high–dose imatinib.
An important implication of recognizing a group of
patients with a different outcome is the possibility of therapeutic interventions for these patients. The ELN recommended that, for these patients, dose escalation may be an
appropriate first step. Unfortunately, to our knowledge
there are no data regarding the efficacy of this approach in
this setting. There has also been interest in examining the
use of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors for patients with suboptimal response. However, to our knowledge, there are
currently no data available regarding the benefit of these
agents in this setting and how this may compare with dose
escalation.
We conclude that patients with a suboptimal
response as defined by the ELN recommendations constitute a distinct category of patients with an outcome that

may be different (usually worse) from that of patients
with optimal response. However, the category of suboptimal response includes a heterogeneous group of patients
with different outcomes, depending on the time when a
suboptimal response is determined. Therapeutic interventions aimed at improving the outcome of patients with
this response need to consider this heterogeneity.
After submission of this article, a report by Marin
et al has been published on this topic.20 In this study, 224
patients with CML treated with standard dose imatinib
were analyzed to examine the value of suboptimal
responses and failure. These investigators found that criteria for failure identify patients with significantly worse
cytogenetic response, progression-free survival, and overall survival than other patients. Patients with suboptimal
response according to their response at 6 and 12 months
had a worse outcome, but those with suboptimal response
at 18 months had a similar outcome to those with no failure or suboptimal response. Overall, the results of both
studies suggest the validity but also the heterogeneity of
the criteria for suboptimal response.
