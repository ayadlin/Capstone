ABSTRACT
Ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) is overexpressed in human pancreatic adenocar­
cinoma (PDAC) and activate cell growth. Recent studies have identified small
molecules that block EphA4. In this study, we investigated the correlation between
EphA4 expression and the prognosis of patients with PDAC. We also examined
the cytostatic efficacy of 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl benzoic acid (compound 1), a small
molecule that blocks EphA4, in PDAC cells. Overall survival of patients with EphA4
positivity was significantly shorter than that of patients with EphA4 negativity (P =
0.029). In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that EphA4 expression was an
independent prognostic factor in PDAC patients (P = 0.039). Compound 1 showed
a cytostatic efficacy in PDAC cells expressing EphA4 in vitro and in vivo. Our study
indicated that compound 1 suppressed both EphA4 and Akt phosphorylations, and
induced apoptosis in PDAC cells expressing EphA4. In conclusion,compound 1 has a
high potential as a therapeutic agent for patients with PDAC.

cancer [8, 9]. Another study has shown that Eph receptor
A4 (EphA4) is overexpressed in PDAC and promotes
cancer cell growth [10], suggesting that EphA4 is a likely
prognostic factor or a molecular target for therapy of
PDAC.
EphA4 is a member of the erythropoietin-producing
hepatocellular (Eph) family of receptor tyrosine kinases.
Eph receptors were first identified in the late 1980s [11].
The Eph family of receptors is the largest subgroup of
receptor tyrosine kinases and is activated by interacting
with cell surface ligands called ephrins. Eph receptors are
classified into two subfamilies, type A and B, according to
their binding affinities for ephrin ligands that are classified
into two subclasses, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor
(A type) and transmembrane domain (B type) [12]. In
general, EphA receptors bind ephrin A ligands, but there
are some exceptions including EphA4 binding ephrin B
ligands. The roles of Eph receptors/ephrins have been
reported in humans [13]. Eph receptor-ligand interactions

INTRODUCTION
Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
is one of the most aggressive cancers, with a very poor
prognosis [1, 2]. A recent study of cancer incidence
and mortality has indicated that PDAC will become the
second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030
in the United States [3]. Surgical resection is the only
curative treatment for PDAC. However, because of the
difficulty to detect PDAC at an early stage, only 20% of
patients with PDAC can be treated surgically [4]. Several
treatments including chemotherapy and radiotherapy
have been adopted for PDAC, but its prognosis continues
to be insufficient to cure patients [5–7]. Therefore, new
therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the prognosis
of PDAC patients.
Previously, we analyzed the gene expression profiles
of 18 pancreatic tumors and 29 normal human tissues, and
identified hundreds of upregulated genes in pancreatic

result in bidirectional signals; a forward signal that
depends on Eph kinase activity and a reverse signal that
depends on Src family kinases [14]. Eph receptors and
ligands have exhibited various expression patterns and
roles in many types of human cancer cells [14, 15]. It is
known that ephrin-dependent Eph signaling plays a role in
cancer cell growth, migration, and invasiveness through
various signaling pathways [15], including the Ras-Erk/
Akt pathway, integrin-mediated adhesion, and epithelialmesenchymal transition [16–19]. High expression of
EphA4 is associated with a poor prognosis for human
gastric and breast cancers [20, 21]. On the other hand,
EphA4 expression is associated with improved outcomes
in patients with lung adenocarcinoma [22]. A previous
study showed that expression of EphA4 was not correlated
with the prognosis of PDAC [23]. In fact, the roles of
EphA4, including the related signaling pathways in several
cancers, have not been studied extensively.
Noberini et al. identified a small molecule,
2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl benzoic acid (compound 1), that
selectively inhibits binding of ephrin to EphA4 and Eph
receptor A2 (EphA2) [24]. This finding has led to studies
of Eph receptor/ephrin blockade as a strategy in anticancer therapy. Several short peptides and small molecules
have been examined for interference of Eph receptor/
ephrin binding [25, 26]. The efficacy of these peptides
and molecules has been studied in diseases of the nervous
system [27]. In a previous study, EphA4 expression was
correlated with the prognosis of patients with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), and blocking EphA4 with
compound 1 increased the survival of ALS models in vivo
[28]. Therefore, we hypothesized that compound 1 may
have a therapeutic efficacy in PDAC, because EphA4 is
upregulated in patients with PDAC.
In this study, we evaluated the utility of EphA4 as a
biomarker to predict the survival of PDAC patients, and
the possibility of EphA4 as a therapeutic target in PDAC
using compound 1.

than those without EphA4 expression (P = 0.029, Figure
1C). In addition, the median survival times of patients with
EphA4 positivity or negativity were 9.6 and 20.1 months,
respectively. EphA2 expression was not correlated with
the prognosis of PDAC patients (P = 0.464, Figure 1D).
Next, we analyzed the relationship between the expression
of EphA4 and clinicopathological factors in PDAC
patients. As a result, EphA4 expression was not correlated
with other factors (Supplementary Table S2). However,
the expression of EphA4 was significantly associated with
poorer overall survival in univariate analysis (HR 1.678;
95% CI 1.048–2.704; P = 0.030, Table 1). Moreover,
similar to lymph node metastasis, univariate analysis
indicated that EphA4 expression was an independent poor
prognostic factor for PDAC patients (HR 1.648; 95% CI
1.025–2.667; P = 0.039, Table 1).

Expression of EphA4 and EphA2 in human
PDAC cell lines
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed high
expression of EphA4 in MIAPaCa-2 cells and PK-59
cells, however, low expression of EphA4 in other PDAC
cell lines or the human normal diploid fibroblast cell line
HS-K (Figure 2A). Western blotting showed same results
of EphA4 expression, while expression of EphA2 was
observed in all cell lines including HS-K (Figure 2B).

Blocking EphA4 with compound 1 inhibits
the proliferation of PDAC cells
Next, we examined cytostatic effects by blocking
EphA4 and EphA2 with compound 1 in PDAC cells using
a WST assay (Figure 2C). EphA4-positive MIAPaCa-2
cells and PK-59 cells, EphA4-negative PCI-43P5 cells,
and HS-K cells as a normal control were used in this
experiment. Compound 1 showed cytostatic effects
in MIAPaCa-2 cells or PK-59 cells, and no effects
in PCI-43P5 or HS-K cells (Figure 2D). At 24 hours
after application of compound 1, the proliferation of
MIAPaCa-2 cells was significantly inhibited by more
than 300 μM compound 1 compared with 1% DMSO only
(P < 0.01, Figure 2D). At 48 hours after application of
compound 1, the proliferation of MIAPaCa-2 cells was
significantly inhibited by more than 200 μM compound 1
compared with 1% DMSO only (P < 0.05 or 0.01, Figure
2D). The same result was found in PK-59 cells (Figure
2D), while the effect was weaker than MIAPaCa-2 cells.
However, the proliferation of PCI-43P5 and HS-K cells
was slightly inhibited by 400 μM compound 1. These
results indicated that compound 1 exerted cytostatic
effect in EphA4-positive cells in a concentration and
time-dependent manner. And also the extent of cell
growth inhibitory effect was consistent with the degree of
expression of EphA4.

RESULTS
EphA4 and EphA2 expression in human PDAC
tissues and its correlation with prognosis and
clinicopathological factors
We examined the expression patterns of EphA4 and
EphA2 in human PDAC tissues by immunohistochemical
staining. There were EphA4- and EphA2-positive cases of
human PDAC samples, but normal pancreatic duct tissues
of all controls did not express EphA4 or EphA2 (Figure 1A
and 1B). Among the 99 patients, expression of EphA4 and
EphA2 was observed in the PDAC tissues of 46 (46.5%)
and 71 (71.7%) patients, respectively. The median followup time of all patients was 14.1 months. Patients with
EphA4 expression had significantly lower survival rates

of MIAPaCa-2 cells treated with 400 μM compound
1 for 2 hours showed cleaved caspase-3 that is activated
in apoptotic cells (Figure 3D). Flow cytometry showed
a larger number of annexin V-positive cells among
MIAPaCa-2 cells treated with compound 1 compared
with the control (Figure 3E). In addition, the rate of early
apoptotic cells, which were defined as annexin V positive
and PI negative, was significantly higher in MIAPaCa-2
cells treated with compound 1 than in the control
(P < 0.0001, Figure 3F). On the other hand, in PCI-43P5
cells, the rate of early apoptotic cells in each group was
not significantly different (P = 0.062, Supplementary
Figure S1). These data indicated that compound 1 induced
apoptosis only in EphA4-positive PDAC cells.

We investigated the signaling pathways associated
with EphA4 in PDAC by blocking EphA4 with compound
1. We focused on two signaling pathways activated
in cancer, Akt and Erk pathways, because a previous
report showed that Akt and Erk pathways are correlated
with cell proliferation as a downstream pathway of Eph/
ephrin interactions [15]. First, we found that EphA4
phosphorylation was suppressed by 400 μM compound 1
(Figure 3A). Next, we found that Akt phosphorylation was
suppressed at 2 and 4 hours after application of 400 μM
compound 1 in MIAPaCa-2 cells (Figure 3A). Moreover,
Erk phosphorylation was slightly increased by compound
1 in MIAPaCa-2 cells (Figure 3A). In PCI-43P5 cells,
both Akt and Erk pathways were unchanged by treatment
with compound 1 or 1% DMSO only (Figure 3A). These
results indicated that compound 1 inhibited EphA4 and
Akt phosphorylation only in EphA4-positive cells. Under
administration of ligand of EphA4, EphA4 phosphorylation
and Akt phosphorylation were also suppressed by 400 μM
compound 1 (Figure 3B). And, Erk phosphorylation was
increased by compound 1 (Figure 3B). It was indicated that
compound 1 blocked binding between ligand and EphA4
and suppressed EphA4-Akt pathway.

Validation of live imaging using MIAPaCa-2
cells expressing firefly luciferase
To assess the therapeutic effect of compound 1 in
individual animals using an orthotopic PDAC mouse
model, we first prepared MIAPaCa-2 cells transduced
with a conventional replication-defective lentiviral vector
carrying the firefly luciferase gene (MIAPaCa-2.Fluc).
Stable expression of luciferase in these cells was confirmed
by optical imaging in vitro, which showed a quantitative
correlation between the MIAPaCa-2.Fluc cell number and
luminescent signal intensity (Figure 4A and 4B).

DISCUSSION

Methods (Figure 4C). Six mice each were administered
with compound 1 or 1% DMSO only (control). The mice
were analyzed by optical imaging on days 7, 14, 21, 28
and 35 after tumor cell implantation. Quantitative analysis
at various time points was performed by measuring
photons/sec/mouse and expressed as the relative increase
of photons compared with day 7 (Figure 4E). The results
of three representative cases in each group on days 7 and
35 after tumor cell implantation are shown in Figure 4D.
All mice in the control group showed tumor progression as
evidenced by increasing bioluminescent signal intensities.
However, mice in the compound 1-treated group showed
minor tumor progression compared with the control
group. On day 35 after tumor cell implantation, mice in
the compound 1-treated group showed significant signal
inhibition compared with the control group (P = 0.0039,
Figure 4F). On day 35 after tumor cell implantation, mice
in the compound 1-treated group had significantly lower
tumor weights than the control group (P = 0.0033, Figure
4G). These results showed the efficacy of compound 1 to
inhibit PDAC tumor growth by i.p administration.

Our study indicated that the expression of EphA4
was correlated with the overall survival of patients with
PDAC. Furthermore, EphA4 was an independent prognostic
factor in PDAC. Many retrospective analyses have reported
clinicopathological variables, such as the tumor size,
lymph node metastasis, and CA19-9 levels, which had a
correlation with the survival of PDAC patients [29–31].
In these previous studies, lymph node metastasis was
indicated as the strongest prognostic factor in PDAC [32].
Our results also showed that lymph node metastasis was
the strongest prognostic factor, and EphA4 was the second
most significant prognostic factor in PDAC compared with
the other clinicopathological factors. It has been previously
reported that high expression of EphA4 is correlated with
the prognosis of patients with breast and gastric cancers [20,
21]. However, Giaginis et al. analyzed 67 PDAC patients
and reported that only EphA5 and EphA7 were correlated
with the patient prognosis [23]. In the data base which is
COSMIC, EphA4 is mutated in 2 samples in all 251 samples
of PDACs. Mutation type is substitution missense in both of
2 samples. It is considered that the mutation of EphA4 is not
remotely related with PDACs because there are a quite few
cases with mutation of EphA4 in PDACs. In this study, we
analyzed more patients with PDAC and found that EphA4,
but not EphA2, was correlated with the prognosis, suggesting
that EphA4 is a useful prognostic biomarker for PDAC.
Pancreatic cancer is often resistant to chemotherapy
or radiotherapy. To improve the prognosis of patients
with pancreatic cancer, it is necessary to investigate new
therapeutic targets or strategies. Because Nakamura et al.
and Iiizumi et al. found that EphA4 was overexpressed in
PDAC and related to the proliferation of cancer cells [9,
10], we focused on EphA4 as a new therapeutic target for
PDAC. In 2008, Noberini, et al. reported a small molecule,
termed compound 1, which selectively inhibits ephrin
binding to EphA4 and EphA2 [24]. In this study, we found
that compound 1 exerted a cytostatic effect on EphA4positive PDAC cells only. EphA2 was expressed more
widely in PDAC cell lines than EphA4, but compound
1 showed no cytostatic effect on EphA2-positive PDAC
cells. EphA2 has been correlated with cancer cell survival,
and some previous studies have reported that therapeutic
targeting of EphA2 is effective for some cancers
[25, 33, 34]. However, our results suggested that EphA2
had no major correlation with the survival of PDAC cells.
Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying
the suppression of PDAC cell proliferation by compound
1. In our study, it was indicated that phosphorylation level
of EphA4 in PDAC cells was upregulated. EphA4 was
activated without administration of ligand. The fact indicated
the possibility that EphA4 was activated by ligand which
was expressed in PDAC cells themselves or EphA4 itself
or other ligand-independent factors. In a previous study,

In vivo effects of compound 1 on orthotopic
tumors and major organs
We analyzed the in vivo effects of compound 1 on
orthotopic tumors and major organs in mouse models by
immunohistochemical staining. First, as previously shown
by in vitro assays (Figure 3), we investigated whether
compound 1 suppressed Akt phosphorylation and induced
apoptosis in orthotopic tumors. Akt phosphorylation
levels were lower in the compound 1-treated group than
in the control group (Figure 5A). More apoptotic cells
were also found in the compound 1-treated group than
in the control group by TUNEL assays (Figure 5A). The
number of apoptotic cells in the compound 1-treated
group was significantly larger than that in the control
group (P  =  0.0046, Supplementary Figure S2). The
frequency of Ki-67-positive cells showed no significant
difference between compound 1-treated and control
groups (data not shown). Next, we investigated the
side effects of compound 1 on major organs including
the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen. These
organs were collected after treatments and subjected to
immunohistochemical staining and TUNEL assays. There
were no differences in the brain tissue after treatment of
both compound 1-treated and control groups (Figure 5B),
such as structure difference or neuronal loss. And we could
not find any neurological disorder during the treatment
in mice. No significant findings were noted in the other
major organs of both compound 1-treated and control
groups (Figure 5B). In addition, TUNEL assays showed
no apoptotic cells in the major organs of both groups (data
not shown). And, the change of body weight of mice in
each group during treatment was nearly equal (Figure 5C).

it was found that the Erk/Akt pathway was activated in
pancreatic cancer cells and played a role in pancreatic
cancer cell proliferation [35]. Moreover, Eph receptors/
ephrins are related to these pathways [36, 37]. Therefore,
we focused these pathways and showed that compound 1
suppressed Akt phosphorylation and slightly activated Erk
phosphorylation. Both Erk and Akt pathways are regulated
by the small GTPase Ras [38]. However, the Akt pathway
can be activated independently of Ras and there is crosstalk regulation between Erk and Akt pathways. Rommel, et
al. demonstrated that Akt phosphorylation inhibits the Erk
pathway [39], and Menges, et al. showed that activation of
Erk signaling causes negative feedback inhibition of the
Akt pathway [40]. Our results indicated that compound 1
suppressed the Akt pathway and upregulated the Erk
pathway, which is consistent with these previous reports.
And, under administration of ligand of EphA4, compound 1
also suppressed EphA4-Akt pathway. It showed that
compound 1 had the suppressive effect on ligand-dependent
EphA4 signaling pathway in PDAC cells. In addition, the
present data showed that compound 1 induced apoptosis in
PDAC cells via the Akt pathway. This pathway regulates
various cellular functions including apoptosis [41]. Datta
et al. found that Bad is a target gene of Akt, and that
unphosphorylated Bad forms a heterodimer with BclXL or Bcl-2 and blocks their anti-apoptotic activity [42],
triggering an imbalance in the levels Bcl-2 family members
and the release of cytochrome C. As a result, the caspase
cascade including caspase-3 is induced and stimulates
PARP cleavage, an indicator of apoptosis initiation [43]. We
showed that compound 1 suppressed Akt phosphorylation
and upregulated cleaved caspase-3 in PDAC cells,
suggesting that compound 1 induced apoptosis via the Akt
pathway in EphA4-positive PDAC cells.
In vivo examination showed that compound 1
suppressed tumor growth by i.p. administration.
Furthermore, compound 1 suppressed Akt phosphorylation
and induced apoptosis in EphA4-positive PDAC tumors.
We also analyzed the expression of Ki-67 in orthotopic
tumors. Ki-67 is regarded as a proliferation marker
correlated with cell cycle progression [44]. However, we
found no difference in the expression of Ki-67 between the
treatment and control groups. In terms of the side effects
of compound 1, we found no significant effects on major
organs by compound 1. Therefore, compound 1 may be
safe for use in therapy of patients with PDAC in the future.
In conclusion, compound 1 has great potential as a
therapeutic agent for patients with PDAC.

patient). Patients without information on survival and
clinicopathological factors were omitted from analysis.
A total of 84 patients were subjected to the analysis.
Informed consent was obtained from patients, and the
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Hokkaido University Hospital (No. 014-0221).

Cell lines and culture
Human PDAC cell lines (MIAPaCa-2, PK-59,
and Panc-1) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). SUIT2, which is a human PDAC cell line, and HS-K, which
is a human cell line of normal diploid fibroblasts, were
obtained from RIKEN (Tokyo, Japan). PCI-43P5, which
is a human PDAC cell line, was previously established
from surgically resected primary carcinoma tissues in our
laboratory [46]. All cell lines were cultured in appropriate
media (MIAPaCa-2 and Panc-1 in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium, HS-K in minimum essential medium α,
and the other cell lines in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Cell culture
Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Immunohistochemical staining
Paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into thin
sections and mounted on glass slides. The sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol.
Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling for 15 minutes
in citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol.
Nonspecific reactions were blocked with 10% normal
goat serum (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) and antibody diluent
with background reducing components (DAKO, Tokyo,
Japan). Immunohistochemical reactions were carried
out using enzyme polymer methods with the Histofine
series (Nichirei). Primary antibodies were applied to
the sections overnight at 4°C followed by 20 minutes of
incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature.
A list of primary antibodies is shown in Supplementary
Table S1. Immunohistochemical reactions were visualized
with DAB (Nichirei) followed by counterstaining with
hematoxylin and mounting with coverslips. The intensity
of EphA4 staining was evaluated using following criteria:
strong positive (scored as 2+), dark brown staining in
more than 50% of tumor cells; weak positive (1+), any
lesser degree of brown staining appreciable in tumor
cells; absent (scored as 0), no appreciable staining in
tumor cells. Positive cases were accepted only as strongly
positive (2+) staining if three reviewers independently

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human samples
For tissue microarray (TMA) analysis, 99 resected
tissue samples were obtained from PDAC patients
at our institute between 1999 and 2005. TMA blocks

defined them as such. For apoptosis analysis in vivo, we
performed TUNEL assays using a commercially available
kit (Apoptosis in situ Detection Kit; WAKO, Osaka,
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cells, MIAPaCa-2 and PCI-43P5, were applied
in 6-well plate at 1 × 105 cells and pre-incubated for
24 hours, following cultured with medium with 10% FBS
and added 400 μM compound 1 or 1% DMSO only in
each well and incubated for 1, 2, 4 hours. For investigating
interaction between ephrin and EphA4, MIAPaCa-2 cells
were applied in 6-well plate at 1 × 105 cells and preincubated for 24 hours, following cultured with medium
without FBS for 2 hours. After that, 400 μM compound
1 or 1% DMSO only were added in each well. At 1 hour
after that, 10 ng/ml recombinant human ephrin-A4 (R&D
system, Minneapolis, USA) or PBS only were added each
well and incubated for 1 hour.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNAs were extracted from cells using
an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and used for
cDNA synthesis (Prime Script RT Master Mix, TAKARA
BIO, Shiga, Japan). cDNA products were used to
amplify target genes using Power SYBR Green (Life
Technologies). PCR reactions and data analysis were
performed in a StepOne Real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan), using the comparative CT
method and the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Primers
used in this study are as follows: GAPDH (Forward:
5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, Reverse: 5′GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′), EphA4 (Forward:
5′-GACCTGAAACTGTAGCAGTGACTC-3′, Reverse:
5′-TGCCAACGCTGCTCCTG-3′). Primers specificity
was confirmed by peak melt curve before using. All
experiments were performed in duplicate for each
sample.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 minutes, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100
for 5 minutes, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin for 1 hour. Primary anti-pan-cytokeratin
(Affymetrix, Tokyo, Japan) and anti-cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology, Tokyo, Japan) antibodies were
added to the cells, followed by incubation for 1 hour at
room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were
incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life
Technologies) for 1 hour, and then mounted on slides using
Dapi-Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham,
USA). The cells were imaged with a BIOREVO BZ-9000
(Keyence, Osaka, Japan).

Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
containing protease inhibitors aprotinin and PMSF.
Protein samples were resolved by 7.5% or 15% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
England). The membranes were probed with primary
antibodies against target molecules (Supplementary
Table S1) overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with
secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
for 1 hour at room temperature. Secondary antibodies
were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Immunoreactivity was detected by the Image Lab &
ChemiDoc XRS Plus system (BIO RAD, Tokyo, Japan).
β-Actin served as a loading control.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry were conducted using an Annexin
V-FITC Early Apoptosis Detection Kit (Cell Signaling
Technology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended at
a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 1 × binding buffer. After
double staining with FITC-Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI), the cells were analyzed using a FACS Canto
II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, California,
USA).

Cell proliferation assay (WST assay)
Cell proliferation was assessed using a Cell Coun­
ting Kit-8 (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan). MIAPaCa-2,
PK-59, PCI-43P5, and HS-K cell lines were used in this
assay. Cells (5 × 103/well) were seeded in 96-well plates
and cultured for 24 hours before treatment. The cells were
then treated with 200, 300, and 400 μM compound 1 or
1% DMSO only for 24 and 48 hours. At 4 hours after
addition of 10 μl WST-8 reagent to each well, absorbances
were measured at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader.
The viability of cells treated with 1% DMSO only was set
at 100%, and the absorbance of blank wells with medium
and without cells was set at zero.

Orthotopic pancreatic cancer models
and therapy schedule
Female BALB/c-nu/nu mice were purchased
from CLEA Japan. At 6 weeks of age, a left subcostal
incision was made in the mice under anesthesia induced
with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).
MIAPaCa-2 cells expressing luciferase (MIAPaCa-2.Fluc)
were adjusted to 5 × 105 cells/30 μl HBSS containing
Matrigel (Corning, NY, USA) and injected below the
capsule of the pancreas just beneath the spleen using a
27 G needle and 50 μl Hamilton syringe. The abdominal

wound was closed by suturing with 3–0 non-absorbable
surgical sutures. These procedures were carried out
according to a previous report [47]. From 1 week after
injection of the cancer cells, compound 1 (50 mg/kg, five
times per week) or 1% DMSO only were intraperitoneally
(i.p.) administered for 4 weeks. The mice were then
sacrificed to evaluate tumor weights and perform
immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors and major
organs including the brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and
spleen. Animal procedures were conducted according to
the guidelines of the Hokkaido University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee using an approved
protocol.

Bioluminescence in cultured cells or live mice
was examined by optical imaging using a cooled CCD
system (Xenogen IVIS). For in vitro imaging, luciferase
expression of MIAPaCa-2.Fluc cells was confirmed
at 10 minutes after addition of luciferin (10 μl/well;
Promega, Tokyo, Japan). For in vivo imaging, mice were
anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine
(10 mg/kg) and then i.p. administered luciferin (200
μl/mouse). After 10 minutes, bioluminescent signals
were analyzed with the Xenogen IVIS with a 10 second
exposure time. The mice were analyzed weekly from 1
week after injection of the cancer cells. To quantitate the
tumor burden, bioluminescent signals were calculated
from the imaging data using Living Image software 3.2
(Xenogen, Alameda, California, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistical analysis
Unless indicated otherwise, the results are presented
as the mean ± standard error of the mean of at least three
independent experiments. Data were analyzed using the
Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s exact test, or χ2 test as
appropriate. Overall survival was calculated from the date
of surgery to the date of the last follow-up or patient death.
Univariate survival analysis was performed according to
the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival differences were
estimated by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was
conducted using the Cox proportional hazards regression
model. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered
significant. The confidence interval (CI) was determined
at the 95% level. All data were analyzed using JMP® 10
software.
