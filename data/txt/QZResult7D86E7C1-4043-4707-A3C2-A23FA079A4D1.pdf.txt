BACKGROUND: Fibrosis is a cardinal feature of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) both in local peritumoral tissue and systemic sites (cardiac). 5-HT, a commonly secreted NET amine, is a known inducer of fibrosis,
although the mechanistic basis for it and growth factors regulating fibrosis and proliferation in the tumor microenvironment are unclear. We hypothesized that targeting 5-HT2B receptors on tumor cells would inhibit SI-NET 5-HT
release and, thereby, fibroblast activation in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We studied the 5-HT2B receptor
antagonist PRX-08066 in NET cell lines (KRJ-I, H720) and in the coculture system (KRJ-I cells: fibroblastic HEK293
cells) using real time polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, Ki67 immunostaining, and flow cytometry-based caspase 3
assays to assess antiproliferative and profibrotic signaling pathways. RESULTS: In the 5-HT2B expressing SI-NET cell
line, KRJ-I, PRX-08066 inhibited proliferation (IC50 4.6x109M) and 5-HT secretion (6.9  109M) and decreased
ERK1/2 phosphorylation and profibrotic growth factor synthesis and secretion (transforming growth factor beta 1
[TGFb1], connective tissue growth factor [CTGF] and fibroblast growth factor [FGF2]). In the KRJ-I:HEK293 coculture
system, PRX-08066 significantly decreased 5-HT release (>60%), Ki67 (transcript and immunostaining: 20%-80%),
TGFb1, CTGF, and FGF2 transcription (20%-50%) in the KRJ-I cell line. 5-HT itself stimulated HEK293 proliferation
(25%) and synthesis of TGFb1, CTGF and FGF2. PRX-08066 inhibition of KRJ-I function reversed these effects in the
coculture system. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the 5-HT2B receptor may be an effective antiproliferative and antifibrotic
strategy for SI-NETs because it inhibits tumor microenvironment fibroblasts as well as NET cells. Fibrosis and proliferC 2010

Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) are cancers originating from serotonin-producing enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the diffuse neuroendocrine system,1,2 and the carcinoid syndrome reflects excessive serotonin (5-HT)
release.2 Carcinoid syndrome symptomatology includes diarrhea, flushing, bronchoconstriction, and fibrosis in the local
peritumoral tissue (mesentery) and distantly in the heart or lungs.3-5
5-HT exhibits both mitogenic and fibrogenic effects as noted in fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial
cells.6-8 This effect is mediated via G-protein coupled 5-HT receptors, which activate mitogenic pathways through the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and JNK activation.9,10 Previously, we have demonstrated that 5-HT
stimulated proliferation (EC50 ¼ 25 nM) of the neoplastic SI-NET (EC cell-derived) cell line, KRJ-I.11 This process was
transduced via phosphorylation of ERK, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and

transcription of c-Jun and Ki67, indicating functional 5HT signaling coupled to proliferation. Other studies have
noted that 5-HT modulates valvular subendocardial cell
proliferation; human heart valves express messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for 5-HT1B, 1D, 2A, and 2B receptors,12
and
5-HT
agonists
(fenfluramine,
dexfenfluramine, pergolide, cabergoline, ergotamine) are
associated with pulmonary fibrosis and valvular heart disease.13,14 Considerable evidence, therefore, exists that 5HT2B receptors are involved in cellular pathways that culminate in fibrosis.
Information regarding the structurally complex
peritumoral microenvironment and its role in regulating
tumor cell function is sparse.15 The tumor microenvironment comprises an admixture of endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and fibroblasts whose interaction culminates
in tumor growth, progression, and the development of fibrosis.16,17 A series of key events include the production
of growth factors, chemokines, and extracellular matrix
proteins by a subpopulation of fibroblasts, the cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs). In cell cultures, phenotypic
features of CAFs can be replicated by TGFb stimulation,
suggesting that this growth factor is critical for the regulation (modulation) of cell function in the tumor microenvironment.18 TGFb, CTGF, and FGF2 are also
synthesized and secreted by NET cells and are considered
to modify the behavior of local fibroblasts and endothelial
cells in the carcinoid tumor microenvironment and distantly in the endocardium.5,19
The interaction of tumor cells and fibroblasts has not
previously been evaluated in NETs because no appropriate
models existed. In other cancers, in vitro models have been
used to study cell migration and intercellular cross talk
between different cell types,20-23 while in vivo experiments
use a suspension of CAFs and tumor cells injected into
mice to evaluate enhanced tumor progression.15 We
hypothesized that targeting 5-HT2B receptors would inhibit
SI-NET 5-HT release and, thereby, fibroblast activation in
the tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, we investigated
whether targeting the 5-HT2B receptor expressed on KRJ-I
cells inhibited cell proliferation and 5-HT production and
then the role of 5-HT in the production and secretion of
profibrotic factors particularly as a paracrine effector in a
NET:fibroblast coculture model system.

KRJ-I11,24-26 (SI-NET), NCI-H72027 (atypical bronchopulmonary NET, originally obtained from ATCC), and
the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (originally obtained from ATCC).28 The receptor profile of tissues and cell lines were determined using real time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Effects of the specific 5-HT2B receptor antagonist PRX-08066, originally
developed for pulmonary hypertension, were examined
on NET cell viability (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide uptake29) and on basal and
stimulated (isoproterenol, a b-adrenergic agonist30:
108M) 5-HT release using ELISA.11,30 The antiproliferative effects of PRX-08066 were confirmed by ERK1/2
phosphorylation (ELISA)11 and Ki67 and caspase 3 transcripts quantified using RT-PCR.11,31,32 Secretion and
transcript levels of profibrotic/angiogenetic factors
TGFb1, CTGF, and FGF2 were determined in response
to PRX-08066 and in the coculture model (KRJI:HEK293). Activity of caspase 3 and alterations in live/
dead cells in the coculture system was analyzed by the PhiPhiLux assay, propidium iodide uptake,26 and flow
cytometry. In separate studies, the effects of 5-HT alone
on HEK293 proliferation and fibrogenic factor synthesis
and secretion, was studied.
Normal EC cell isolation

EC cells were isolated as described, approximately 1
 106 cells were obtained/sample.30
Cell culture conditions

KRJ-I and NCI-H720 were cultured as
described.11,24-26 HEK293 was maintained in Dulbecco
modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine
serum and antibiotics.28
Coculture of cell lines

HEK293 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate (Falcon, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ; 4  105 cells/mL) for 24
hours. KRJ-I cells (4  105 cells/mL) were added using
coculture filter well inserts (Falcon, BD) with 1 lm pore
size diameter. A 1:1 dilution of Ham’s F12/M199 and
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used
for normal growth condition for both cell lines. After 24
hours, the 5-HT2B antagonist was added (109 M) to the
filter well insert. Cells and medium were harvested after
24 hours for ELISA and RT-PCR.
Chemicals

PRX-08066 (5-HT2B antagonist) was a gift of EPIX
Pharmaceutical (Lexington, Mass).

Proliferation Studies
Five  105 cells/mL, seeded in 96-well plates at 100 lL (4
plates/experimental condition) were stimulated with
PRX-08066 (107M to 1011M: n ¼ 6 wells/concentration).25,26 After 24 hours, mitochondrial activity was
measured after adding MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-ly]-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide: 0.5mg/mL per
well) for 3 hours. The optical density was read photospectrometrically at 595 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad 3500, Hercules, Calif).29 Results were normalized to
control (unstimulated cells) and the effective half-maximal concentrations calculated.
ERK1/2 signaling pathway analysis

After 2 hours incubation, KRJ-I cells and H720 cells
were stimulated with PRX-08066, (109M) for 60
minutes and MAPK (ERK) signal activity determined
using SuperArray CASE ELISA kits (SABiosciences, Frederick, Md; ERK—FE-002) as described.11
Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) isolation and Reverse
Transcription

RNA was extracted from each tissue (30-50 mg), EC
cell preparation or cell line (1  106, n ¼ 4) using TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) and cleaned (Qiagen
RNeasy kit and DNeasy Tissue kit, Qiagen Inc., Valencia,
Calif). After conversion to cDNA (High Capacity cDNA
Archive Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif),11,32
RT-PCR analyses were performed using Assays-on
Demand and the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System.11,32 All primer/probe sets were obtained from
Applied Biosystems. The primers chosen were designed to
encompass exon:exon boundaries and, therefore, preferentially amplified cDNA which minimized the possibility of
genomic DNA contamination. Non-RT controls were
included as negative controls for each of the samples. In
preliminary analyses, we ran the PCR mix on gels and confirmed presence of single bands for each primer set used.
RT-PCR data was normalized using the DDCT method
and the housekeeping gene ALG9 (for KRJ-I, EC cells and
SI-NET samples) and b-actin (for HEK cells). The 5HT2B receptor profile was analyzed in all samples, while
profibrotic and cell cycle markers, TGFb1, CTGF, FGF2,
TPH1, caspase 3, and Ki67 transcripts, were measured after 24 hours of incubation with 5-HT2B antagonist
(109M) in KRJ-I cells cultured for 48 hours.
5HT, TGFb1, CTGF, and FGF2 secretion

Basal levels of these agents were measured using
commercially available ELISA assays (5-HT: BA 10-0900;

(CTGF).19 Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2
 105 cells/mL) and agents levels were measured after 1
hour, 2 hours, and 24 hours.
Ki67 immunostaining

KRJ-I cells were immunostained with rabbit antiKi67 (Novocastra Laboratories, Bannockburn, Ill) as
described using 2 color (nuclear stain, DAPI, blue/green,
flourescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-Ki67).33 Cells
were counted in 10 high-power field (HPF)/section and
quantified as percentage of positive cells.34
Caspase 3 pathway activation and Propidium
iodide uptake analyzed by FCM

Caspase 3 activity was evaluated in cocultured cells
using the PhiPhiLux G1D2 kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) as
described.35,36 Briefly, cells were incubated with 75 lL of
PhiPhiLux G1D2 for 1 hour at 37 C in 5% CO2. Before
the measurements of caspase-3 activity (in the FITC
channel), cells were costained with propidium iodide (PI)
(5 lg/mL). During FCM, 4 gates were used including
PI-positive/FITC negative (dead cells), PI-negative/
FITC-negative (live cells, no caspase activity), PI-negative/FITC positive (live cells, undergoing caspase activation) and PI-positive/FITC positive (dead cells with
caspase activity). Populations in each gate were quantified
using flow cytometry as described.25,35,36
Statistical Evaluation
All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel and Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
Calif). Sigmoidal dose responses and nonlinear regression
analyses were calculated to identify half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations. Alterations in signal transduction, transcriptional activation, growth factor release,
caspase 3 pathway activation, and dead/alive cells were
assessed using 2-tailed, t test for paired data.

5-HT2B Receptor Profile
5-HT2B receptor levels were analyzed in normal SI mucosa, SI-NETs, isolated EC cells, and in KRJ-I, NCIH720, and HEK293 using RT-PCR. 5-HT2B mRNA
was identified in normal mucosa and in all 12 SI-NETs.

DISCUSSION
Normal EC cells do not express the 5-HT2B receptor and
its expression in the neoplastic phenotype suggests gain of
function and, potentially, a regulatory role in SI-NET
interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This phenomenon is tumor-specific; 100% of EC cell-derived SINETs in this study expressed this receptor, while the
bronchopulmonary NET cell line investigated did not.

geting of the 5-HT2B receptor with PRX-08066. Because
5-HT exhibits an autocrine proliferative role in 5-HT
secreting neoplastic NETs,26 targeting these cells with a
specific 5-HT2B receptor antagonist provides a novel therapeutic option.
In previous studies, the proliferative activity of
5-HT in KRJ-I and NCI-720 was shown to be dependent
on the expression of 5-HT2 receptor subtypes (at least
5-HT2A/C) and was concentration-dependent with EC50
in the nM range.25 Similar proliferation effects have been
noted in the 5-HT secreting prostate cancer cell line PC3
(10 nM: 5-HT1A/B and 5-HT2A receptors),37-39 the
5-HT2A expressing breast cancer cell line MCF-740, and
in human choriocarcinoma cell lines JEG-3 and BeWO
(both 5-HT2A).41 In the current study, we identified a
selective mitogenic role for 5-HT2B in KRJ-I cells.
Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by
PRX-08066 in KRJ-I, while NCI-H720 cell viability was
not impaired, consistent with absence of the 5-HT2B receptor in the lung NET. In addition, both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated 5-HT release was significantly
reduced by the antagonist in KRJ-I cells. This demonstrates that the 5-HT2B receptor is functionally coupled to
both proliferative and secretory pathways in this cell line.
To further investigate signal transduction pathways
involved in the antiproliferative effect of 5-HT2B receptor
antagonist, we investigated phosphorylation of ERK.
Recent studies have demonstrated a direct role of 5-HT
receptor subtypes in vascular and tracheal smooth muscle

cell proliferation. The mechanism is via coupling of 5HT2A receptors and the ERK pathway, while 5-HT2B
receptors activate ERK through the RAS pathway.42,43,44
In the current study, ERK1 of 2 phosphorylation was significantly decreased by PRX-08066 in KRJ-I cells. Our
findings indicate that the antiproliferative effect of the
5-HT2B antagonist is consistent with inhibition of an
ERK-mediated proliferative event. In contrast, no decrease
in ERK phosphorylation was noted in the 5-HT2B receptor negative cell line NCl-720. This accentuates the necessity of defining individualized therapeutic strategies based
on an individual tumor’s receptor profile.25
Escape from TGFb1 mediated growth control
occurs in SI-NETs and is associated with increased ERK
phosphorylation and signaling.45 Agents that target the
ERK pathway may, therefore, provide an additional strategy for reversing activation of the autocrine TGFb1 proliferation pathway in SI-NETs. The current study
supports this proposal because targeting 5-HT2B receptors, in addition to inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, also
resulted in a significant decrease in TGFb1 transcription
and secretion.
For almost a century, it has been recognized that SINETs often present with fibrosis in the peritumoral tissue,
the adjacent mesentery and peritoneum, as well as in the
right side of the heart or lungs.46 We hypothesized that
fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment play an important role in regulating NET-mediated fibrosis and metastasis. Numerous studies attest to the key role of the
microenvironment and have established it is an integral
part of tumorigenesis through the production of mitogenic, angiogenetic, and proteolytic factors that affect the
phenotype of all cells in the vicinity.47 TGb1 and CTGF
are well-characterized profibrotic factors and elevated serum levels have been related to fibrosis in SI-NETs.19
FGF2 is a well-known stimulator of vascular endothelial
cells48,49 and plays a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis.50,51 5-HT has previously been suggested as an important factor that induces fibrosis.5,52 In our study,
transcript levels and secretion of TGb1, CTGF, and
FGF2 were significantly reduced in KRJ-I cells treated
with PRX-08066. 5-HT directly stimulated HEK293
MTT uptake and Ki67 transcription as well as transcription of TGFb1, CTGF, and FGF2. These effects were
reversed by ketanserin, a 5-HT2A/C antagonist, and demonstrates that proliferation and fibrogenic activity of this
fibroblast cell line is directly activated by 5-HT. These
data suggest an important role for the 5-HT2B receptor
and 5-HT produced by tumor cells itself in the regulation

of peritumoral fibrosis and angiogenesis. Thus, targeting
the 5-HT2B receptor might not only inhibit NET proliferation but also decrease 5-HT release and profibrotic
growth factor secretion, hence, abrogating the development of peritumoral fibrosis and possibly angiogenesis.
To further define the role of 5-HT in the pathogenesis of both tumorigenesis and fibrosis, we developed a
NET:fibroblast coculture system. This was used to evaluate the effects of selectively targeting 5-HT2B receptors in
individual components of this system. HEK293 cells exhibit features of fibroblast-specific intracellular pathways
and have been previously used as fibroblast model.53-55
These cells do not express 5-HT2B receptors and cannot
be inhibited by PRX-08066, but, as we have noted
(above), respond to 5-HT with proliferation and synthesis
of fibrogenic factors. Blocking 5-HT2B receptor with
PRX-08066 resulted, as expected, in a significant increase
of caspase 3 and decrease of Ki67 in KRJ-I cells in coculture. In addition, a significant decrease in TGb1, CTGF,
and FGF2 synthesis was noted, similar to our single cell
studies. Interestingly, transcripts of these factors and Ki67
were also decreased in coculture d HEK293 cells, despite
the absence of a 5-HT2B receptor on this cell line. Given
that levels of these transcripts remained unchanged in
HEK293 cells cultured alone and our observations that
5-HT directly stimulate HEK293 activity through the
5-HT2A/C receptor, it is clear that KRJ-I-derived 5-HT in
the coculture model is responsible for the cellular crosstalk between tumor cells and fibroblasts. To confirm the
biological relevance of the transcript analysis data, we
determined caspase 3 activity and cell death in coculture d
KRJ-I and HEK293 cells. A significant increase in dead
cells was noted in PRX-08066 treated KRJ-I cells and
induction of the caspase 3 pathway in HEK293 cells confirming the transcript analyses.
In conclusion, SI-NETs express 5-HT2B receptors
as does the EC cell-derived SI-NET cell line, KRJ-I. Targeting this receptor with the specific antagonist, PRX08066, resulted in a significant decrease in 5-HT secretion
and a reduction in KRJ-I cell proliferation. The MEK/
ERK pathway played a role in this antiproliferative effect.
By using a coculture model of the tumor environment
(KRJ-I:HEK293 cells), we identified a decrease in profibrotic/angiogenetic factors in both tumor cells and fibroblasts after inhibition of the 5-HT2B receptor. We
postulate that the tumor proliferative activity of SI-NETs
(including cell growth and the development of desmoplasia) is associated with the particular microenvironment
in the peritoneum and that tumor cells support this

necessary milieu through the secretion of profibrotic/
angiogenetic factors. Targeting key receptors such as
5-HT2B and blocking critical proliferative pathways in the
tumor cells provide a possible therapeutic strategy to prevent tumor progression, fibrosis, and metastasis in this
neuroendocrine neoplasia. This may apply to other
fibrotic processes associated with neuroendocrine cell
dysregulation, eg, Crohn’s disease.56
