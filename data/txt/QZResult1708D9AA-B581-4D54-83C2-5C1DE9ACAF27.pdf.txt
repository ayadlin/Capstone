Abstract
Non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer patients carrying oncogenic
EGFR mutations initially respond to EGFR-targeted therapy,
but later elicit minimal response due to dose-limiting toxicities
and acquired resistance. EGF816 is a novel, irreversible
mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor that speciÔ¨Åcally targets
EGFR-activating mutations arising de novo and upon resistance
acquisition, while sparing wild-type (WT) EGFR. EGF816
potently inhibited the most common EGFR mutations
L858R, Ex19del, and T790M in vitro, which translated into
strong tumor regressions in vivo in several patient-derived
xenograft models. Notably, EGF816 also demonstrated antitumor activity in an exon 20 insertion mutant model. At levels

Introduction
One of the major drivers in non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is the EGFR proto-oncogene (1). The most common
EGFR oncogenic mutations are either an amino acid substitution at position 858 from leucine (L) to arginine (R; L858R) or
in-frame deletion within exon 19 (Ex19del). Together, these
account for about 90% of all EGFR mutations (2). It is well
established that lung cancers bearing these common mutations
are highly responsive to Ô¨Årst-generation EGFR inhibitors geÔ¨Åtinib and erlotinib with objective response rates of approxi1

above efÔ¨Åcacious doses, EGF816 treatment led to minimal
inhibition of WT EGFR and was well tolerated. In single-dose
studies, EGF816 provided sustained inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, consistent with its ability for irreversible binding.
Furthermore, combined treatment with EGF816 and INC280, a
cMET inhibitor, resulted in durable antitumor efÔ¨Åcacy in a
xenograft model that initially developed resistance to Ô¨Årstgeneration EGFR inhibitors via cMET activation. Thus, we
report the Ô¨Årst preclinical characterization of EGF816 and provide
the groundwork for its current evaluation in phase I/II clinical
trials in patients harboring EGFR mutations, including T790M.

mately 70% (3, 4). Common side effects of these drugs include
skin rash, diarrhea, and loss of appetite, which are caused by
inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR (5). In fact, skin rash has
been suggested as a biomarker for drug efÔ¨Åcacy (6). Unfortunately, drug resistance emerges in a majority of patients with a
median time to progression of 9 to 12 months. In 50% of these
cases, drug resistance is due to an amino acid substitution at
gatekeeper position 790 from threonine (T) to methionine
(M; T790M). The other 50% of drug resistance mechanisms
involve signaling pathway activations bypassing EGFR such as
MET ampliÔ¨Åcation, epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT),
SCLC transformation, or PI3K mutation (7, 8). In addition to
being the predominant acquired mechanism of resistance,
several groups have reported various rates of de novo T790M
mutation in pretreatment specimens (9‚Äì12).
Second-generation EGFR inhibitor afatinib demonstrated
improved activity against T790M-resistant models, but was also
equally potent against WT EGFR, leading to a narrow safety
window (13, 14). Accordingly, in clinical trials, the efÔ¨Åcacy of
afatinib in T790M-positive patients appeared to be constrained by
the dose-limiting toxicities arising from WT EGFR inhibition (15).
Several experimental agents that overcome the T790M-driven
resistance are now in clinical trials, including CO-1686 (16),
AZD9291 (17), and EGF816 (ClinicalTrials.gov IdentiÔ¨Åer:

NCT02108964). All three agents are covalent EGFR inhibitors that
are designed to selectively target the T790M mutation while
sparing WT EGFR. Thus, the safety window with respect to EGFR
inhibitor‚Äìassociated side effects such as rash and diarrhea is
expected to improve. During the review period of this article,
AZD9291 (TAGRISSO) gained FDA-accelerated approval for treatment of EGFR T790M-positive lung cancer patients. The discovery
of EGF816 will be disclosed elsewhere (18). Herein, we report the
preclinical characterization of EGF816, and demonstrate its superior efÔ¨Åcacy against primary activating and T790M-resistant mutations as well as its WT selectivity in comparison with early
generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in various in
vitro and in vivo models. In addition, we demonstrate that EGF816
is efÔ¨Åcacious in exon 20 insertion (Ex20ins) mutants that are
resistant to Ô¨Årst-generation EGFR inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Animals and cell lines
Female Foxn1 nude mice and rats were purchased from Harlan
Laboratories and were between 6‚Äì8 or 5‚Äì10 weeks old, and
20‚Äì25 g or 150‚Äì230 g, respectively, at time of experiment.
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were purchased from
Jackson Laboratory and were between 6‚Äì8 weeks old and 20‚Äì25 g
at time of experiment. All animal studies were conducted under a
GNF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved
protocol in compliance with Animal Welfare Act regulations and
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. NCIH1975, HCC827, NCI-H3255, and A431 were obtained from
ATCC within the past 9 years. They were authenticated by Novartis
department of Developmental and Molecular Pathways by SNP
genotyping. HaCaT was kindly provided by K. Balavenkatraman
from Novartis Basel. Human Epidermal Keratinocytes, neonatal
(HEKn) were ordered from Invitrogen. Cells were routinely
screened for Mycoplasma sp. by MycoAlert (Lonza) and used within
a 4-month period from when they were thawed.
Cellular target modulation assays
H1975, H3255, HCC827, A431, and HaCaT cells were maintained in RPMI media supplemented with antibiotics and 10%
FBS. HEKn cells were maintained in EpiLife media supplemented with growth supplement. All cells were maintained in a
37 C, 5% CO2 humidiÔ¨Åed incubator. In 384-well plates,
H1975, H3255, HCC827, A431, or HaCaT were seeded with
RPMI media supplemented with antibiotics and 5% FBS,
whereas HEKn cells were seeded in EpiLife media supplemented
with 5% FBS. After an overnight incubation, serial diluted compounds were transferred to cells and incubated for 3 hours. HaCaT
and HEKn cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF (50 ng/mL
EGF for A431) for 5 minutes. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100
buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates
were analyzed by sandwich ELISA utilizing goat anti-EGFR capture antibody, anti-phospho-EGFR(Y1173), and anti-rabbit HRP.
Signal was measured by chemiluminescent detection.
Receptor occupancy determination
Cells were labeled with 14C-EGF816 for 3 hours in an incubator, washed with PBS, and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitors. Anti-EGFR sepharose was
used for overnight immunoprecipitation. Beads were washed
with lysis buffer and prepared for NuPAGE. Phosphor-imaging

1592 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

of dried gels was carried out with a Typhoon Phosphor Imager and
EC50 values determined by graphical analysis.
Cellular proliferation assays
Cells were seeded 500 cells/well in solid white 384-well plates
in maintenance media. Serial diluted compounds were transferred to cells. After 3 days, cell viability was measured by
CellTiter-Glo (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BaF3 cell viability was measured 2 days after compound
treatment using Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
Luminescent readout was normalized to 0.1% DMSO-treated
cells and empty wells. Five EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines were
generated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH, Boston,
MA). MGH134, MGH121, MGH141, and MGH157 were derived
from patients who developed resistance to erlotinib with acquired
T790M mutation (19). MGH119-R was generated in vitro by
treating MGH119 (EGFR Ex19del) with geÔ¨Åtinib for a prolonged
period. The sensitivity of EGF816 on these lines was tested as
described previously (20).
In vivo efÔ¨Åcacy studies
H1975, HCC827, and H3255 cells were grown aseptically in a
37 C incubator with 5% CO2. H1975 and H3255 were cultured in
RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 10 mmol/L
HEPES. HCC827 was cultured in DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate and 10% FBS.
For H1975 and HCC827 mouse tumor models, 5e6 or 10e6
cells, respectively, were subcutaneously implanted in female
Foxn1 nude mice. For H3255 mouse tumor model, 5e6 cells
were subcutaneously implanted in female NSG mice, and
when tumors formed, fresh tumor tissues were implanted in
female NSG mice. For H1975 rat tumor model, female Foxn1
nude rats received a single radiation dose of 400 to 500 rad
3 days before 5e6 cells were subcutaneously implanted. For
LU0387 PDX model, tumor fragments from seed mice inoculated with primary human lung cancer tissues (LU0387)
were harvested and used for inoculation into nude mice.
Tumor volumes were measured by digital caliper three times
a week and body weights of all animals were recorded
throughout the study. Caliper measurements were calculated
using (L  W2)/2.
EGF816 or afatinib were formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose
(MC), 0.5% Tween80 suspension formulation. Erlotinib was
formulated in 90% water, 10% ethanol/cremophor EL (1/1).
Animals were weighed on dosing days and drugs were administered by oral gavage at 10 mL/g of body weight.
All data were expressed as mean  SEM. Between-group
comparisons were carried out in GraphPad Prism 6 using a
one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey or Dunn. The
level of signiÔ¨Åcance was set at P < 0.05. SigniÔ¨Åcance compared
with the vehicle control group is reported unless otherwise
stated.
In vivo efÔ¨Åcacy studies of EGF816 in two patient-derived xenograft models generated at MGH (MGH134 and MGH141) were
conducted as described previously (20).
Pharmacodynamic measurement
Target inhibition of pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK in vivo was
evaluated by either Western or Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD)
technology. Western blot analyses of tumor sample lysates were

performed using standard techniques and included a 4 C overnight incubation with primary antibodies speciÔ¨Åc to the phosphorylated or total protein targets. Chemiluminescent signals
were detected and quantiÔ¨Åed with the VersaDoc Imager (BioRad). Phospho-EGFR band intensity was normalized to total
EGFR band intensity for each tumor sample. In MSD-based assays,
EGFR protein was captured using MSD Standard Streptavidin
Gold plates (cat. no. L15AA-2, MSD) coated with 1 mg/mL of
human EGFR biotinylated antibody (cat.no. BAF231, R&D Systems). Phospho-EGFR was detected with phospho-Tyr conjugated
SULFO-TAG detection antibody (cat.no. R32AP-5, MSD). Data
was calculated as percent of vehicle control.
Dusp6 expression measurement
Frozen skin from experimental rats was homogenized with
TRIzol (Invitrogen) using the Qiagen TissueLyser. RNA was
extracted following the manufacturer's speciÔ¨Åcations for the
Qiagen RNeasy 96-well Universal Tissue kit, and quantiÔ¨Åed on
the Nanodrop. cDNA was generated using the QuantiTect
Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen) and the high-yield 8-hour
reaction. TaqMan qPCR was run using the RT2 kit (Qiagen) on
the AB HT7900 machine according to the manufacturer's speciÔ¨Åcations. Samples were run in duplicate and normalized to
Actin B.
WT pEGFR detection by IHC in normal skin tissues
Skin tissues from experimental mice were Ô¨Åxed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 24 hours, then transferred to 70% ethanol.
Tissues were processed into parafÔ¨Ån blocks and sectioned at 5 mm
onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). Slides were stained for pEGFR
using the Ventana Discovery XT staining Module and a rabbit
monoclonal antibody against Tyr1173. Additional background
reducers were included (Dako).
Generation and characterization of EGF816-resistant in vivo
models
Mice with stable HCC827 tumor (as described in the "in vivo
efÔ¨Åcacy studies" above) were dosed with EGF816 (10, 20, and
50 mg/kg escalated increasing) until tumor no longer responded
to EGF816. The tumor became resistant to EGF816 after 103-day
dosing. The fresh EGF816-resistant tumor tissues were implanted
in SCID mice subcutaneously for efÔ¨Åcacy study. EGF816 was
formulated as described above. INC280 was formulated in
0.25% MC, 0.05% Tween 80 in water solution. Animals were
weighed on dosing days and drugs were administered by oral
gavage at 5 mL/g of body weight.
Additional Materials and Methods can be found in Supplemental Information.

Results
EGF816 is a potent inhibitor of mutant EGFR and shows good
receptor occupancy in cells
EGF816 irreversibly targets EGFR by forming a covalent bond
to C797 at the active site (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 18). The
determined KI and kinact of EGF816 on EGFR(L858R/790M)
mutant are 0.031 mmol/L and 0.222 min 1, respectively.
The cellular activity of EGF816 on EGFR mutants were assessed
using three well-characterized cell lines, H3255, HCC827, and
H1975, which harbor the L858R, Ex19del, and L858R/T790M
mutations, respectively. After incubation with cells for 3 hours,
EGF816 showed potent inhibition of pEGFR levels in H3255,
HCC827, and H1975 with EC50 values of 5, 1, and 3 nmol/L,
respectively (Table 1; Fig. 1A). EGF816 was further evaluated for
its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, where it produced EC50
values of 9, 11, and 25 nmol/L in H3255, HCC827, and H1975,
respectively (Table 1; Fig. 1B). In contrast, erlotinib showed weak
inhibitory effect on H1975 as expected, with EC50 values of 1,400
and 7,400 nmol/L in target modulation and proliferation assays,
respectively (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, EGF816 was also tested
in a panel of cell line models established directly from erlotinibresistant patient biopsy samples that had acquired a T790Mresistant mutation. These cell lines were resistant to geÔ¨Åtinib;
however, they were all sensitive to EGF816 treatment (Fig. 1C;
Supplementary Table S1). As expected, EGF816 was also effective
on the erlotinib-sensitive patient-derived cell line MGH119
(EGFR Ex19del mutation), but not on the WT EGFR-containing
patient-derived cell lines MGH025 and NH11. Taken together,
these data demonstrate that EGF816 is a potent inhibitor of cells
driven by mutant EGFR.
The relationship between receptor occupancy and inhibition of
signaling was investigated by exposing cells to 14C-radiolabelled
EGF816 for 3 hours, followed by quantiÔ¨Åcation of the radiolabeled EGF816 by phosphor-imaging. As shown in Fig. 1D, a
dose-dependent increase in signal until saturation was observed
for H1975 and HCC827 cells, which indicated that EGF816
bound to mutant EGF receptors in a dose-dependent manner and
was able to fully occupy the receptor at higher doses. Further data
analysis showed that EGF816 has an OC50 (compound concentration at 50% occupancy) value of 2 and 5 nmol/L on HCC827
and H1975, respectively (Table 1; Fig. 1E), in a similar range as
determined by ELISA-based target modulation assay (Table 1).

Irreversible Mutant-Selective EGFR Inhibitor

and tolerability of EGF816 was examined in vivo in several
mutant EGFR-containing cell line xenograft models. In H1975
mouse model, oral administration of EGF816 once daily for
14 days resulted in dose-dependent efÔ¨Åcacy (Fig. 2A). Although
3 mg/kg of EGF816 did not provide statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
efÔ¨Åcacy compared with vehicle group (P > 0.05), EGF816 dosed
at 10 mg/kg induced tumor growth inhibition with a T/C
(tumor/control volume) of 29% (P < 0.0001). At higher doses
of 30 and 100 mg/kg, signiÔ¨Åcant tumor regressions (T/C, 61%
and 80%, respectively) were achieved. Afatinib at 25 mg/kg
showed a tumor growth inhibition corresponding to a T/C of
31%, similar to EGF816 at 10 mg/kg. Similar observations were
obtained in the H1975 rat xenograft model (Fig. 2B). Fourteen
days after treatment, tumor growth was signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited
(T/C of 11%) at 10 mg/kg. Partial to complete tumor regressions
(T/C, 78% and 100%, respectively) were achieved at 30 and
100 mg/kg of EGF816. Afatinib showed a tumor growth inhibition corresponding to T/C of 56% at 10 mg/kg. The lowest
tested dose of EGF816 at 10 mg/kg was more efÔ¨Åcacious and
signiÔ¨Åcantly different from afatinib at 10 mg/kg (P < 0.0001) in
this model.
In the HCC827 mouse xenograft model, the lowest oral dose of
3 mg/kg once daily for 21 days induced statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
tumor regression (T/C of 74%; Fig. 2C). Near complete regression with T/C of 92%, 96%, and 98% was observed at
EGF816 doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg. As expected, the HCC827
model was also sensitive to erlotinib, which at 30 and 60 mg/kg
achieved regressions similar to that of EGF816 at 3 mg/kg
(Fig. 2C). Erlotinib at its MTD of 120 mg/kg showed similar
maximum efÔ¨Åcacy as EGF816 at 10 mg/kg or above. In the H3255
xenograft model, oral dosing of EGF816 at 30 mg/kg once
daily achieved signiÔ¨Åcant antitumor activity compared with vehicle (P < 0.0001), and resulted in a tumor regression of 85%
(Fig. 2D). In a separate study in the same model, once daily oral
dosing of erlotinib at 100 mg/kg achieved 82% tumor regression.
In addition, EGF816 was tested in xenograft models generated
from patient-derived cell lines MGH134 (L858R/T790M) and
MGH141 (Ex19del/T790M). Both patients developed T790M
resistance following erlotinib treatment in the clinic. In both
models, treatment with EGF816 at 30 mg/kg induced signiÔ¨Åcant
tumor regression (Fig. 2E and F).
Compound tolerability was monitored by group percent body
weight change as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. EGF816 was
well tolerated, and body weights were maintained at all doses
during the course of treatment. However, afatinib showed slight
body weight loss (5%) at 25 mg/kg once daily (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), a dose that also resulted in tumor growth inhibition
corresponding to T/C of 31% (Fig. 2A). Erlotinib was also tolerated at lower doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg, but at MTD of 120 mg/kg,
moderate body weight loss (12% on day 11) was observed
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). In all the models tested, EGF816
demonstrated an improved therapeutic index compared with the
earlier generation EGFR inhibitors.
EGF816 inhibits EGFR and downstream signaling
pathways in vivo
To conÔ¨Årm the in vivo efÔ¨Åcacy of EGF816 was due to its ability
to effectively suppress EGFR signaling, a single-dose experiment
was conducted in both H1975 and HCC827 mouse xenograft
models to examine the kinetics of target inhibition by EGF816
with respect to plasma exposure. Following a single dose of

www.aacrjournals.org

EGF816, a time course of pathway inhibition was determined
by Western blotting of tumor lysates. In both models, there was
a dose-dependent increase in both the extent and duration of
pEGFR inhibition (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S3A). In the
H1975 model, at 3 and 10 mg/kg, the pEGFR levels were
inhibited partially within the 24-hour period. At 30 mg/kg,
the dose that gave signiÔ¨Åcant tumor regression in the 14-day
efÔ¨Åcacy study (Fig. 2A), inhibition of pEGFR was observed as
early as 1-hour postdose and was maintained through 24 hours
with >80% inhibition. Levels of pEGFR returned to baseline
at 48-hour postdose (Fig. 3A). In addition, downstream biomarkers such as pAKT and pERK were also inhibited as early as
1-hour postdose and maintained for 7-hour postdose, and
returned to baseline levels at 16- to 24-hour postdose (Fig. 3B).
In the HCC827 model, at 1 mg/kg, the pEGFR level was inhibited
partially within the 24-hour period, but at 3 and 10 mg/kg, the
doses that gave signiÔ¨Åcant tumor regression in the 14-day efÔ¨Åcacy
study (Fig. 2C), pEGFR levels were inhibited for >80% within the
24-hour period (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Inhibition of pEGFR
and downstream biomarkers such as pAKT and pERK was
observed as early as 1-hour postdose and was maintained through
24-hour post-single oral dose of EGF816 at 10 mg/kg (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In both models, total EGFR, AKT, and ERK
protein levels were not affected by EGF816.
Together, these data suggest that sustained high level inhibition of pEGFR is required for good antitumor efÔ¨Åcacy in mouse
xenograft models. In both models, pEGFR inhibition outlasted
pharmacokinetics, which was consistent with the irreversible
binding mechanism of action of EGF816. The HCC827 model
was more sensitive to EGF816 with higher and more sustained
inhibition at the same dose level than the H1975 model. This
was supported by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, which showed that pEGFR protein synthesis rate is approximately Ô¨Åve times faster in the H1975 xenograft model than in
the HCC827 model (unpublished observations).
EGF816 is selective against WT EGFR
To demonstrate the selectivity of EGF816 toward mutant
forms of EGFR, multiple approaches were taken. First, we
determined the binding afÔ¨Ånity of EGF816 to a panel of
kinases, where it showed high-afÔ¨Ånity binding to 16/451
kinases (Supplementary Fig. S4). These included mutant forms
of EGFR as well as nine kinases with an analogous Cys residue
at a similar location in the active site as EGFR. To evaluate the
selectivity of EGF816 on mutant over WT EGFR, we employed
three different WT EGFR cell line models: A431, HEKn, and
HaCaT. The epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 contains
ampliÔ¨Åed EGFR (21); alternatively, the spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and primary keratinocytes (HEKn) contain nonampliÔ¨Åed EGFR levels, and their
dependence on ErbB signaling for proliferation or survival has
been described previously (22, 23). We believe these two lines
serve as better models than A431 in studying skin toxicity due
to WT EGFR inhibition. Regardless of which WT cell line model
was used, cellular-based assays showed that EGF816 is selective
toward mutant over WT EGFR (Table 1). In patient-derived cell
line models, EGF816 selectively targeted EGFR-mutant‚Äìcontaining lines over WT EGFR lines (Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, proÔ¨Åling of 89 lung cancer models showed that
EGF816 is selective against EGFR-mutant cell lines (whose
mutations are within catalytic domain) compared with WT

Inhibition of EGFR in cells generally decreases the expression level of dual speciÔ¨Åcity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6) via
inhibition of the MAPK pathway (26, 27). Consequently, the
effect on Dups6 expression in normal skin may be one way to
assess the WT EGFR selectivity of EGF816. In the H1975 rat
xenograft model, Dusp6 gene expression was measured in rat
skin after 14 days of once daily dosing (Fig. 4B). EGF816
at efÔ¨Åcacious doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg (Fig. 2B) did not
appear to inhibit Dusp6 expression in rat skin, whereas

afatinib at 10 mg/kg (signiÔ¨Åcantly less efÔ¨Åcacious; Fig. 2B)
caused signiÔ¨Åcant inhibition of Dusp6 expression (80%
inhibition). EGF816 at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg inhibited the Dusp6 gene expression by approximately 70%, consistent with a large but Ô¨Ånite in vivo selectivity of EGF816 for
mutant versus WT EGFR.
Furthermore, the effect of EGF816 on WT EGFR phosphorylation in vivo was assessed directly. Phospho-EGFR levels were
determined by IHC in normal mouse skin tissues taken from
HCC827 efÔ¨Åcacy studies after 21 days of dosing (Fig. 4C). Even at
100 mg/kg dose, which is fully efÔ¨Åcacious (Fig. 2C), pEGFR level
in normal tissue is comparable with that of vehicle control, which

indicated minimal WT EGFR inhibition by EGF816. On the
contrary, erlotinib showed dose-dependent inhibition of WT
EGFR as expected.
All together, these results strongly indicate that EGF816 possesses good selectivity for mutant EGFR compared with WT EGFR.
EGF816 is efÔ¨Åcacious in an exon 20 insertion
mutant model in vivo
Ex20ins mutation is the third largest EGFR-mutant population, consisting of 4% to 9% of all EGFR-mutant NSCLC (28).
These insertion mutations occur in multiple forms (base
pair insertions and/or duplications) as well as at multiple
codons in exon 20 (predominately clustered between codons
763‚Äì774). On the basis of preclinical studies and clinical
observations, all Ex20ins mutants (except A763_Y764insFQEA), for the most part, are associated with lower sensitivity
to clinically achievable doses of current EGFR TKIs, including

1598 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

third-generation inhibitors AZD9291 and CO-1686 (16, 17,
29‚Äì32). To understand whether EGF816 had any efÔ¨Åcacy
against this class of EGFR mutants, we chose three Ex20ins
mutants of highest clinical frequency, and generated engineered BaF3 cell lines: D770_N771insSVD, V769_D770insASV,
and H773_V774insNPH (29). In the proliferation-based
assays, EGF816 potently inhibited these three Ex20ins mutants,
with EC50 of 7, 11, and 190 nmol/L on D770_N771insSVD,
V769_D770insASV, and H773_V774insNPH, respectively
(Table 1). This promising result prompted us to test the
antitumor effect of EGF816 in an EGFR Ex20ins PDX model
(LU0387; H773_V774insNPH). Oral administration of
EGF816 at 30 mg/kg once daily for 18 days achieved 45%
tumor inhibition. EGF816 at 100 mg/kg resulted in a tumor
regression of 81% and achieved signiÔ¨Åcant antitumor activity
compared with vehicle (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5A). Both doses were
well tolerated (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that EGF816

might be efÔ¨Åcacious in patients harboring exon20 insertion
mutations and that its use in this patient population merits
further investigation in the clinic.
C797S mutation, MET ampliÔ¨Åcation, and EMT are
among the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGF816
in preclinical models
Acquired resistance to EGF816 was studied in cellular models
using two different methods. In the BaF3-based rapid mutagenesis approach, EGFR L858R and L858R/T790M BaF3 lines
were randomly mutated by treatment with ENU (N-ethyl-Nnitrosourea). Selection pressure was applied with EGF816 from
80 to 1,000 nmol/L gradually over a period of 1 month. Deep
sequencing identiÔ¨Åed several hot spot mutations that led to
resistance to EGF816, one of the highest frequency mutations
being C797S. This same mutation was also reported by Janne
and colleagues following a similar approach using another
irreversible EGFR inhibitor WZ-4002 (33). Cys797 is the amino
acid that is covalently modiÔ¨Åed by irreversible EGFR inhibitors.
The mutation of this residue to Ser abolishes the covalent
interaction of the inhibitor with the EGFR protein, thus greatly
reducing the afÔ¨Ånity/potency of these irreversible inhibitors. In
a different approach where resistance to EGF816 was generated
by stepwise method, H1975 and HCC827 cell lines were treated
with increasing concentrations of EGF816 from IC30 to 1,000
nmol/L (>IC90) over a period of approximately 6 months. A
total of 11 and 6 resistant clones were isolated and further
characterized from EGF816-resistant H1975 and HCC827,
respectively. None of these resistant clones showed reactivation
of pEGFR, suggesting that resistance is due to other pathway
activations that bypass EGFR signaling (Fig. 6A). Instead, we
observed EMT in 9/11 and 2/6 resistant clones of H1975 and
HCC827, respectively (Fig. 6A). The induction of EMT protein
marker expression correlated with changes in morphology
(Supplementary Fig. S5). It was further conÔ¨Årmed that all of
the EGF816 resistant clones were also resistant to other available EGFR inhibitors.
Using the in vivo mouse models of H1975 and HCC827, an
attempt to generate acquired resistance to EGF816 was performed

www.aacrjournals.org

by continuously treating the animals with either Ô¨Åxed (H1975) or
incrementally higher (HCC827) doses of EGF816. H1975 resistance did not occur even after 3 months of continuous dosing at
30 mg/kg EGF816. In HCC827, however, resistance to EGF816
emerged in about 2 months. Phospho-RTK array analysis revealed
MET pathway activation (Fig. 6B). Single-agent treatment of a
reimplanted, resistant tumor with either EGF816 or selective
cMET inhibitor INC280 (34) resulted in mild tumor growth
inhibition (difference between the two groups is not statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant; Fig. 6C). Only the dual inhibition of EGFR and cMET
with EGF816/INC280 combination induced signiÔ¨Åcant and durable tumor regression.

Discussion
Targeted therapies have changed the landscape of cancer
treatment. NSCLC patients with oncogenic EGFR mutations
are one patient population beneÔ¨Åting considerably from targeted therapies (35). Earlier generations of EGFR inhibitors
have revolutionized the treatment of NSCLC and are effective in
treating patients with oncogenic mutations L858R and Ex19del.
However, dose-limited toxicities due to WT EGFR inhibition
and eventual acquired resistance have limited their use. Thirdgeneration EGFR inhibitors have the potential to overcome
these limitations and improve the treatment options for
patients who have progressed because of resistance. AZD9291
and CO-1686 are third-generation covalent EGFR inhibitors
with distinct proÔ¨Åles over the earlier generation inhibitors; they
inhibit both activating and resistant EGFR mutations with
selectivity over WT EGFR. As demonstrated in this article,
EGF816 is another novel third-generation EGFR inhibitor that
potently inhibits activating (L858R, Ex19del) and resistant
T790M mutants with nanomolar potency in various cellular
assays (Table 1). In addition, EGF816 also potently inhibits
a panel of patient-derived cell lines that harbor Ex19del,
L858R/T790M, or Ex19del/T790M mutations (Supplementary
Table S1). Taking advantage of its covalent binding, the receptor occupancy of EGF816 was directly visualized using radiolabeled compound. Our data show that EGF816 is able to fully

occupy (inhibit) mutant EGFRs at exposures achievable in vivo
(Fig. 1D). This is signiÔ¨Åcant as EGFR is upstream of signaling
cascades, so complete and sustained inhibition is likely
required to totally shut down the downstream signaling
and promote cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. This is supported
by our observation in the in vivo pharmacodynamic/efÔ¨Åcacy
correlation studies where sustained high level of pEGFR inhibition is required for good antitumor efÔ¨Åcacy in mouse xenograft models. Covalent inhibitors are an excellent choice as they
possess the properties of good potency and can lead to sustained target inhibition, where extent and duration of target
modulation are determined by target protein synthesis rate,
inactivation efÔ¨Åciency of inhibitor, and inhibitor concentration. EGF816 has a longer half-life in human than mouse. In
phase I trial, at all doses tested in human, exposures achieved
were above the targeted exposure required for tumor regression
predicted by xenograft model. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic/efÔ¨Åcacy relationship and modeling, as well as clinical Ô¨Åndings will be published elsewhere.

Even though H1975 is the most widely used patient-derived
cell line model for EGFR L858R/T790M, we also conducted an
efÔ¨Åcacy study in the L858R/T790M-driven patient-derived xenograft model MGH134. The results are in good agreement with
those obtained in H1975 model. Marked tumor regressions were
also observed following treatment of mice bearing MGH141
(Ex19del/T790M) patient-derived xenograft. Our in vivo data
revealed that EGF816 outcompeted earlier generation EGFR inhibitors with superior efÔ¨Åcacy and improved therapeutic index.
Although irreversible mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors such as
EGF816 were originally designed to overcome the T790M resistance, their target proÔ¨Åles suggest that they present an alternative
and better therapy option for both oncogenic and resistant T790M
mutations as Ô¨Årst-line therapy.
WT EGFR plays an important role in normal tissues, including
skin (36). Patients treated with early generation EGFR inhibitors
can develop a papulopustular rash, dry skin, itching, and hair and
periungual alterations, resulting in decreased quality of life (37).
One of the hallmarks of mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors is that

Irreversible Mutant-Selective EGFR Inhibitor

they have improved WT EGFR selectivity, thus are expected to be
better tolerated. We took several approaches to evaluate the WT
EGFR selectivity of EGF816. When proÔ¨Åled against a large panel of
lung cancer cell lines in vitro, EGF816 showed excellent selectivity
on mutant versus WT EGFR containing cell lines. We further
examined WT EGFR inhibition in vivo by either indirectly measuring the WT EGFR biomarker Dusp6 expression in rat skin or
directly measuring WT EGFR phosphorylation in mouse skin.
Both sets of data demonstrated that EGF816 minimally affected
WT EGFR in vivo at efÔ¨Åcacious doses. On the basis of these data, we
expect EGF816 to be well tolerated in human with respect to WT
EGFR‚Äìrelated toxicities.
Besides the commonly occurring activating (L858R, Ex19del)
and T790M-resistant mutations, the third largest EGFR-mutant
population in NSCLC is Ex20ins mutations (28). It has been
reported that, in the most part, currently approved EGFR TKIs are
ineffective on activating Ex20ins mutations based on preclinical
studies (16, 17, 29), thus presenting an urgent unmet medical
need. To our surprise, EGF816 showed potent in vitro antiproliferative effects in three Ex20ins mutant cell lines tested, and
induced near full tumor regression in one patient-derived
Ex20ins xenograft model in vivo at a well-tolerated dose. At this
time, it is not clear whether the differential effect of EGF816
versus AZD9291/CO-1686 in Ex20ins mutant models is compound speciÔ¨Åc or model speciÔ¨Åc. Both AstraZeneca and Clovis
used Ex20_H773_V774HVdup model, which has very rare clinical
incidence (16, 17, 29). On the other hand, the models
we tested have the highest clinical incidence, where the three
Ex20ins mutants studied accounted for approximately 47% of
the Ex20ins mutant population. At 100 mg/kg dosing
where tumor regression was observed in the LU0387 model, WT
EGFR inhibition was also observed (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the
therapeutic window for Ex20_H773_V774insNPH might be
smaller than that for activating EGFR mutations. However, on
the basis of in vitro cell line results, EGF816 is much more potent
on Ex20_D770_N771insSVD and Ex20_V769_D770insASV
mutants than Ex20_H773_V774insNPH (Table 1). Unfortunately, we could not determine the in vivo efÔ¨Åcacy of EGF816 in
Ex20_D770_N771insSVD and Ex20_V769_D770insASV due to
lack of PDX models. If a correlation does exist between the in vitro
and in vivo results, we would expect EGF816 to be efÔ¨Åcacious in the
Ex20_D770_N771insSVD and Ex20_V769_D770insASV models
in vivo at lower doses, thus creating a larger therapeutic window.
Despite the potential of third-generation EGFR inhibitors to
inhibit and prevent T790M-mediated acquired resistance,
tumors will likely adapt other escape mechanisms to develop
resistance. Understanding potential resistance mechanisms
using preclinical models is therefore important and could guide
combination therapies to overcome resistance. Similar to our
observations, EMT seems to be the major resistance mechanism
for CO-1686 in preclinical models (16). Resistance to thirdgeneration EGFR inhibitors is now starting to emerge in the
clinic. Clovis reported that WT-EGFR clone outgrowth due to
tumor heterogeneity plays a major role in CO-1686 resistance

(38). AstraZeneca reported C797S mutation as one of the
resistance mechanisms to AZD9291 (39). The same C797S
mutation was found in MGH121 cells made resistant in vitro
to a third-generation EGFR inhibitor (40). In addition,
MET ampliÔ¨Åcation was also seen as a resistance mechanism to
CO-1686 in the clinic (41). It is encouraging to see the translation of preclinical observations into clinical Ô¨Åndings. Further
preclinical investigation is beneÔ¨Åcial to design strategies to
prevent and/or overcome acquired resistance using rational
combination therapies. In the ongoing clinical trial treating
geÔ¨Åtinib-resistant patients due to MET activation, the combination of INC280 and geÔ¨Åtinib seems promising (42). Planned
clinical trials of EGF816 combination therapies include
INC280 and will help us better understand the clinical beneÔ¨Åt
of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov IdentiÔ¨Åer: NCT02335944)
EGF816 is currently being evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials
in patients harboring EGFR mutations, including T790M.
