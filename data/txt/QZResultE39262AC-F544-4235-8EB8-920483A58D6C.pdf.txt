BACKGROUND: Everolimus, an oral mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, affects tumor growth
by blocking growth factor stimulation, arresting cell cycle progression, and inhibiting angiogenesis. mTOR
inhibitors and agents with primarily antiangiogenic activity have been shown to have efficacy in renal cell
cancer (RCC). This phase 2 study assessed the efficacy of daily oral dosing with everolimus in patients with
RCC. METHODS: Patients had confirmed predominantly clear cell RCC; had received 1 prior therapy; and
had progressive, measurable metastatic disease. Everolimus was given at a dose of 10 mg daily orally without interruption (28-day cycle), with dose modifications for toxicity (graded according to National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0). Patients were evaluated every 2 cycles (8 weeks) using
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). RESULTS: Of 41 enrolled patients, 39 were treated
and evaluable for safety, 37 of whom were evaluable for response (2 patients withdrew after the first week
of therapy). Approximately 78% of the patients were male, the median age was 60 years, 93% had a
Zubrod performance status of 0 to 1, and 83% had received prior therapy. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.2 months and the median overall survival was 22.1 months. Partial responses were
observed in 5 (14%) patients, stable disease lasting 3 months was reported in 27 (73%) patients, and stable disease lasting 6 months was reported in 21 (57%) patients. Nausea (38% of patients), anorexia (38%
of patients), diarrhea (31% of patients), stomatitis (31% of patients), pneumonitis (31% of patients), and rash
(26% of patients) were common. Grade 3 of 4 adverse events included pneumonitis (18% of patients);
transaminase elevations (10% of patients); thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and alkaline phosphatase elevations (8% each of patients); and hyperlipidemia (5% of patients). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study,
everolimus demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity against metastatic RCC as indicated by a PFS  6

Daily Everolimus in Advanced RCC/Amato et al

KEY WORDS: renal cell cancer, kidney cancer, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RAD001,
everolimus, drug therapy.

Until recently, the only effective therapies for metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-a (IFN-a), with response
rates of approximately 15% reported and little if any effect
on patient survival noted.1 However, advances in understanding of the biology of RCC have generated a new
rationale for treating this disease, resulting in the introduction of several new agents that have improved therapy
substantially.2-5
RCCs arise from the cells of the proximal tubules,
and approximately 85% are the clear cell type.6 Loss of
function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene on chromosome 3p is an early event in the development of clear
cell RCC7; defects in VHL are the most common cause of
inherited clear cell RCC, and loss of VHL contributes to
the pathogenesis of RCC in 75% of patients with sporadic
clear cell RCC.8,9 The downstream molecular effects of
this defect include the accumulation of the angiogenic
growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor–A
(VEGF-A), platelet-derived growth factor–b (PDGF-b),
and transforming growth factor–a (TGF-a), and the
increased angiogenesis and blood vessel density that are
characteristic of RCC. Agents that inhibit angiogenesis
have been reported to increase response rates in patients
with clear cell RCC and extend progression-free survival
(PFS) for both untreated3 and previously treated
patients.5 Although these advances provide welcome
options for patients, to our knowledge, complete
responses are still rare; patients still develop disease recurrence and more options are needed.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an
intracellular kinase that regulates cellular responses to
nutrients, energy, and exogenous growth factors.10,11
When energy and nutrient resources are replete, when
growth factors are stimulating the cells, or when defects in
the cells upstream of mTOR provide aberrant stimulation
of its activity, mTOR permits translation of proteins that
drive cell growth, cell proliferation, and the production of
angiogenic growth factors (hypoxia-inducible factor-1
[HIF-1], VEGF, and PDGF). Inhibiting mTOR delays
cell cycling at the G1-S-phase interface, inhibits cell

growth, and inhibits angiogenesis. It may be significant
that mTOR inhibitors have the potential to block both
tumor cell and neovascular cell proliferation as well as the
production and activity of angiogenic growth factors to
inhibit tumor growth through effects on the tumor as well
as by inhibiting tumor vascularization. In this regard, the
antitumor mechanisms of mTOR inhibitors overlap and
extend those of strict VEGF-VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
inhibitors.
Use of mTOR inhibition in the treatment of metastatic RCC was validated in a recent phase 3 trial that compared overall survival (OS) in patients treated with weekly
temsirolimus, thrice-weekly IFN-a, or a combination of
both. The study enrolled 626 previously untreated patients
with metastatic RCC and disease characteristics representative of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) poor-prognosis category. Temsirolimus-treated
patients survived longer (10.9 months vs 7.3 months; hazards ratio [HR], 0.73 [P ¼ .008]) and were free of disease
progression longer (5.5 months vs 3.1 months; P < .001)
than those treated with IFN-a.4 Temsirolimus has been
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced
RCC.
Everolimus is a rapamycin derivative, which differs
from temsirolimus by being an oral agent that is not converted to rapamycin in vivo. Everolimus has antitumor
activity in patients with metastatic RCC,12 including
those patients previously treated with VEGFR inhibitors.13 The pharmacodynamics of everolimus have been
studied using both weekly and daily dosing regimens.
Findings from preclinical-clinical modeling studies14 and
clinical pharmacodynamic studies15 have indicated that
daily dosing with 10 mg achieves consistent inhibition of
mTOR signaling, whereas weekly dosing with 70 mg/
week did not appear to achieve the same level of consistent
target inhibition. The purpose of the current study was to
assess the efficacy of daily oral everolimus in patients with
advanced, clear cell RCC, without limitations based on
risk factors, pretreatment, and disease progression after
cytokine therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Objectives
The current study was a 2-stage, single-arm, phase 2 trial
to determine the PFS of patients with metastatic clear cell
RCC who were receiving daily treatment with everolimus.
Secondary objectives were to assess rates and duration of
response, safety, and toxicity and OS. The study enrolled
41 patients. Patients received everolimus at a dose of 10
mg/day in a 4-week cycle, continuing until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.
Everolimus was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals
(East Hanover, NJ).
Toxicity was assessed at baseline and before each
cycle of therapy using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC), version 3.0. The
safety population included all patients who received at
least 1 dose of everolimus. Dose reductions to 5 mg/day
were planned after treatment interruption and recovery to
grade 2 for any grade 3 or 4 hematologic or grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. If toxicity remained at a grade 2
for 4 weeks, the dose of 10 mg/day could be reinstituted
at the investigator’s discretion.
Patients were evaluated at baseline (>14 days before
the first study dose), every 4 weeks (for safety), and every
8 weeks (for efficacy) while on the treatment regimen; 4
weeks after receiving the last study dose; and every 3
months thereafter (for survival).
Initially, the patients were evaluated every 12 weeks
(for efficacy); however, after 29 patients were enrolled this
interval was decreased to every 8 weeks to improve
documentation of disease stabilization. Clinical response
(complete response, partial response, stable disease, and
progressive disease) was assessed according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)16 using
computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scans (if bone metastases were present
at baseline). The responses were assessed by the treating
physician and/or radiologist (investigator assessment) and
by an independent radiologist.
Patient Eligibility
The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
the Institutional Review Board of Methodist Hospital
Research Institute and was conducted in accordance with
2440

the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice.
All patients were required to provide signed informed
consent.
Enrolled patients had histologically confirmed RCC
with 75% clear cell characteristics; metastatic disease
progressing at a rate not associated with symptoms and
not likely to require palliative treatment within 4 weeks of
enrollment; a history of 1 prior therapy regimen for
RCC, which could include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a molecular targeted agent other than an mTOR
inhibitor; and no therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment.
Baseline assessments within 14 days of study entry
included medical history, physical examination, laboratory
tests, screening assays, MRI scan (brain), CT scan (chest,
abdomen, and pelvis), and bone scan (if bone metastases
were present at baseline). Patients were required to have
adequate physiologic reserves (Zubrod performance status
2); adequate hematologic (absolute neutrophil count
>1500/mL, platelet count >100,00/mL, and hemoglobin
9 g/dL), renal (serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL), and liver
function (serum transaminases 4  the upper limit of
normal and total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL); coagulation
parameters (prothrombin time, international normalized
ratio, and partial thromboplastin time) within normal limits; a cardiac ejection fraction 45% (echocardiogram or
multiple gated acquisition scan); and no evidence of cardiac
ischemia (electrocardiogram). Patients with reproductive
potential were required to practice effective methods of
contraception while on the study. Patients with a prior
malignancy had to be free of disease for at least 3 years,
excluding those with adequately treated basal or squamous
cell skin cancers and in situ cervical cancer.
Excluded from enrollment were patients who were
positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, pregnant
or lactating women, and patients with unstable medical
conditions or other conditions that in the investigator’s
opinion may place them at unacceptable risk. Also
excluded were patients with evidence of central nervous
system metastases or active autoimmune disease; patients
with a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or a transient ischemic attack occurring within 6
months with activity-limiting claudication; and patients
receiving antianginal therapy, immunosuppressive drugs,
steroid therapy within the prior 3 weeks, concurrent anticancer drug therapy, or investigational therapy within 4
weeks of the study.

Whenever possible, systemic treatment with drugs
or agents known to be inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4
isoenzymes was avoided because these enzymes can alter
the metabolism of everolimus.

Statistical Analysis
All data were collected and analyzed on an intent-to-treat
basis. The 2-stage design has a 90% power to determine a
25% PFS at 6 months. After the accrual of 21 patients in
the first stage, if 3 were free of disease progression at 6
months, accrual would continue to a total of 40 patients.
If 8 patients were free of disease progression at 6
months, further study of daily everolimus in this setting
would be considered warranted. For efficacy analysis, estimates of response rates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were provided. An analysis of PFS and
response according to investigator assessment, which was
then compared with an independent review, is also
reported. OS and PFS were estimated using the KaplanMeier estimate.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between May 2005 and October 2006, 41 eligible
patients were recruited; 39 (safety population) were confirmed to have progressing RCC with a predominantly
clear cell histology and received at least 1 dose of everolimus. Two patients withdrew after the first week, 1 to seek
hospice care and the other after a serious allergic reaction
to the CT contrast agent. The remaining 37 patients were
evaluated for efficacy. Patients had a median age of 60
years, 78% were male, and patients were relatively active,
with 100% having a Zubrod performance status 2
(Table 1). Thirty-three (89%) patients had undergone
prior systemic immunotherapy (n ¼ 25), chemotherapy,
and/or treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor. Applying the MSKCC prognostic score for previously treated
patients with advanced RCC,17 24 (58.5%) patients were
determined to be of intermediate risk, 15 (36.6%) to be of
good risk, and 2 (4.9%) to be of poor risk. Patients
remained on everolimus treatment for 8 weeks or until
disease progression.

Efficacy
Among the initial 25 patients, 5 were progression free for
at least 6 months, allowing for recruitment into the second stage. At the data cutoff date (February 2008), 21 of
37 (57%) patients had been progression free for at least 6

of the full study satisfied the predetermined requirement
for the further evaluation of everolimus monotherapy in
this indication. There were no complete responses noted,

patients had dropped out before first restaging because of
clinical disease progression, and 1 patient experienced an
adverse event. The median PFS was 11.2 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.7-36.2 months). (B) Kaplan-Meier

treatment dose). The median overall survival was 22.1 months
(95% CI, 1.4-36.4 months).

27 (73%) had stable disease for at least 3 months. Overall,
70% of patients had either a response or stable disease
for 6 months (Table 2). Responses to everolimus were
noted at several metastatic sites including the lungs,
lymph nodes, liver, and bone. The waterfall plot (Fig. 2)
shows that 24 of 37 patients had some decrease in the size
2442

of their target lesions noted during the study. Among 8
treatment-naı̈ve patients, 2 responded and 6 had prolonged (6 months) disease stabilization. In addition,
responses and disease stabilizations were observed in
patients categorized into the MSKCC low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups.
At the time of data analysis, 26 of the 32 patients
with response or 3 months of disease stabilization had
developed disease progression or died (with a median duration of 9 months [range, 1 to 35 months]) and 6
remained free of disease progression, including 2 patients
with partial responses that lasted >20 months. Four
patients withdrew from the study: 2 by choice, 1 because
of an adverse event (renal failure secondary to intravenous
contrast for CT), and 1 to undergo surgery (metastasectomy). The median PFS for the 5 patients with an objective response was 17.3 months, with durations of 8.3

months, 12.2 months, 17.2 months, 25.1 months, and
37.5 months, respectively. For the 21 patients with stable
disease that lasted 6 months, the median PFS was 17.1
months (range, 6 to 36 months).
CT scans from 31 patients were available for an
independent review of response. In this assessment, there
were 2 partial responses noted, with 20 patients (64.5%)
having a response or stable disease for 6 months, which
is in agreement with the investigator assessment (Table 2).

Nonhematologic Adverse Events

Safety
Common treatment-related adverse events were grade 1
of 2 anorexia (38% of patients), nausea (38% of patients),
diarrhea (31% of patients), stomatitis (31% of patients),
and rash (26% of patients). All patients had some elevation in alkaline phosphatase, which reached grade 3 in 8%
of patients, and 56% of patients had grade 1 of 2 elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase with grade 3
elevations reported in 10% of patients. Biochemical
abnormalities included hyperglycemia (8% of patients
with grade 3), hypercholesterolemia (5% of patients with
grade 3), hypertriglyceridemia (5% of patients with grade
3), and hypophosphatemia. Hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia were managed with medication in 4 patients and
3 patients, respectively. Hematologic toxicities were
thrombocytopenia (92% of patients with grade 1 of 2 and
8% of patients with grade 3) and grade 1 anemia in 31%
of patients. Pneumonitis was grade 1 or 2 in 31% of
patients (Table 3).
Everolimus doses were reduced to 5 mg/day for 13
patients, 5 of whom were later elevated back to the 10–
mg/day level. Grade 3 pneumonitis in 7 (19%) patients
resulted in dose delays of 7 to 14 days and dose reductions; 4 of these patients were later successfully treated at
the 10-mg level after 28 to 56 days. None of these patients
required steroids. When repeat scans demonstrated resolution after the cessation of treatment, therapy was reinstituted at the reduced dose. Everolimus was also delayed for
5 days in a patient with oral mucositis and for 14 days in a
patient because of duodenitis; both patients continued
therapy at a dose of 5 mg/day. Other reasons for reducing
the everolimus dose were thrombocytopenia, failure to
thrive, hyperlipidemia, and patient request, all occurring
in 1 patient each. The patient with hyperlipidemia was
successfully elevated to the 10-mg level after 56 days.

DISCUSSION
With 3 new agents becoming available within 2 years for
the treatment of advanced RCC, concern over the absence
of treatment options has been partially displaced by the
need to determine the most appropriate use of these
agents for specific patients: sequencing the agents; monotherapy versus combination; identifying patients more
likely to respond to specific agents; and, still, the concern
that these new agents, while slowing the progression of
disease for many patients and improving their quality of
life, do not benefit all patients and that resistance usually
develops within a few months.2-4 Current trials are appropriately addressing these issues while continuing to evaluate new agents to replace or complement those now
available.
In the current study, daily treatment with oral everolimus produced responses and prolonged disease control
(11.2 months) in a small population (N ¼ 37) of patients,
the majority of whom had developed disease progression
after cytokine therapy. In 2007, the mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimus, a systemic agent administered on a weekly
schedule, was granted approval for the treatment of
advanced RCC on the basis of the results of a randomized
controlled study with previously untreated, mostly poor2443

Original Article

prognosis patients.4 Although this population is not comparable to the patients in the current study, a prior phase
2 study of temsirolimus18 did enroll a population comparable in size and characteristics; 91% had received prior
immunotherapy or chemotherapy and 50% were considered to be of good-to–intermediate risk. Patients received
weekly doses of 25 mg, 75 mg, or 250 mg. In the absence
of significant differences in efficacy noted among the
groups, the 25-mg dose was brought forward to the phase
3 trial. Among 36 patients in the 25-mg group, responses
were reported in 5.6%, with disease control that included
stable disease for at least 6 months noted in 52.8% of
patients. Time to disease progression was 6.3 months, and
the OS was 13.8 months. To the extent that the studies
are comparable, rates of disease control were similar to
those presented here, with a possible advantage for everolimus with regard to time to disease progression and OS.
Although the observed difference may reflect randomness
related to the size of the populations studied, actual differences in the study populations, and any inherent differences in the 2 agents, the schedule of administration also
may have had an effect. The 10–mg/day everolimus
schedule has been found in modeling14 and in phase 1
pharmacokinetic/pharmacokinetic studies12,15 to produce
more profound and sustained inhibition of mTOR signaling than treatment with the same total dose using the
weekly oral schedule. A recent comparison of daily and
weekly everolimus in patients with advanced breast cancer
also found that the 10–mg/day oral regimen was superior
in efficacy to weekly oral treatment.19
The frequency and severity of biochemical abnormalities and nausea, stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, anorexia,
and vomiting were consistent with the results of other
studies of everolimus monotherapy12,15 and other mTOR
inhibitors,20-22 although the frequency of pneumonitis,
both overall and grade 3, was found to be greater than previously reported. Pneumonitis is known to develop in
patients treated with mTOR inhibitors in the transplantation setting23-26 and has been reported in other studies in
cancer patients treated with everolimus27 and temsirolimus.28 Among 34 women with metastatic breast cancer
who were treated with everolimus on either a daily
(10 mg/day) or weekly (70 mg/week) schedule, El-Maraghi et al27 reported clinical and/or radiologic changes that
were consistent with possible interstitial lung disease
(ILD) in 15 patients, 4 of whom had grade 2 or 3 changes;
2444

5 patients discontinued therapy because of ILD, and all
patients with grade 2 of 3 toxicities were managed successfully with glucocorticoids. Likewise, in the current study,
17 patients developed grade 2 of 3 pneumonitis; doses
were delayed and later reduced in 7 patients with grade 3
toxicities, 4 of whom were successfully re-escalated to the
10–mg/day dose. In our experience, patients should be
monitored closely for the development of pneumonitis,
and those with evidence of disease should be managed
with dose reduction or discontinuation as well as
glucocorticoid therapy.
In addition to temsirolimus, the oral VEGFR kinase
inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib and the anti-VEGF
antibody bevacizumab have been approved (bevacizumab
only in Europe) for the treatment of advanced RCC,2,5,12
thereby expanding the options for treating the disease
beyond monotherapy with 1 of these 4 agents. Randomized phase 3 trials established their efficacy in patients
with advanced RCC. Sorafenib and sunitinib reduce the
kinase activity of the receptors for VEGF (VEGFR) and
PDGF (PDGFR). The resulting antiangiogenic effect on
the tumor vascular cells is believed to be the principal
mechanism for their therapeutic effects in RCC. Bevacizumab binds VEGF, preventing its activation of the
receptor. In contrast, mTOR inhibitors do not affect receptor activation; rather, they block the continued synthesis of VEGF by tumor cells and signaling downstream of
the receptors, which drives proliferation of the endothelial
cells. In patients with RCC, mTOR inhibitors block
VEGF-driven angiogenesis by mechanisms that are different from those for VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors. It is important to note that mTOR inhibitors also have direct
antitumor effects (which are apparent in the efficacy of
these agents against tumors whose growth is driven principally by mechanisms other than angiogenesis19,29) that
may be complementary to those of the VEGFR inhibitors.
These potentially complementary activities offer intriguing possibilities for the use of mTOR inhibitors in
patients who no longer respond to the VEGFR inhibitors,13,30 as well as for combining these agents for patients
in whom VEGFR inhibitors produced an initial
response.31,32
In the current study, daily dosing with 10 mg of
everolimus demonstrated encouraging activity in this
population of mostly cytokine-pretreated patients with
advanced clear cell RCC, results that we believe justify

further evaluation of everolimus monotherapy in previously treated patients with clear cell RCC. Recently
reported findings of a phase 3 randomized study comparing everolimus with best supportive care in 400 patients
with advanced RCC who developed disease progression
after treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib described a
PFS of 4.9 months versus 1.9 months for the placebo
group (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.43) and a 26% probability of being free of disease progression at 6 months.33,34
Additional studies with everolimus in this population
either alone or in combination with anti-VEGF agents are
planned or currently under way.
