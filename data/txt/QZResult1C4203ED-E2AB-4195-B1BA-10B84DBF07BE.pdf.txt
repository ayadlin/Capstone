Abstract
Many chemotherapeutic agents, especially of the alkylating
family, alter fertility in premenopausal females. However, it is
not practically possible to quantify and characterize the
impact of cancer drugs on ovarian reserve in a clinical setting.
Thus, our specific aim was to develop a xenograft model to
characterize the in vivo impact of chemotherapy agents on
human ovary. Ovarian pieces from 24 weeks old abortuses
were xenografted s.c. to severe combined immunodeficient
mice (n = 52). Animals received either a single dose of 200
mg/kg of cyclophosphamide or the vehicle. Grafts were
recovered from the control and treated mice 12 to 72 h after
the cyclophosphamide injection and serially sectioned for
primordial follicle counts. Apoptosis was assessed with
terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1
(PECAM-1) staining, as well as intra-vital fluorescein-conjugated
lectin and Evans blue labeling were done to assess microvasculature by confocal microscopy. Although there was 12%
reduction in primordial follicle density by 12 h following
treatment (P > 0.05), the follicle loss increased significantly at
24 h (53%, P < 0.01) and peaked at 48 h (93%, P < 0.0001).
TUNEL staining peaked at 12 h, earlier than the diminishment
in follicle numbers, and decreased thereafter. Xenograft
vascularization pattern was similar to non-xenografted tissue,
indicating appropriate in vivo drug delivery. The impact of
cyclophosphamide on primordial follicle reserve in our
human ovarian xenograft model is consistent with the clinical
gonadotoxicity of this drug. Human ovarian xenografting is a
promising model to characterize the gonadotoxic effects of
current and emerging cancer drugs without a need for lengthy
clinical studies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10159–62]

Materials and Methods

Introduction
Although the progress in multiagent chemotherapy improved
the cure rates of both adult and childhood cancers, long-term
consequences of these treatments on the quality of life and
especially fertility are now being recognized. The impact of cancer
treatments on fertility is greater than generally perceived. The
probability of developing cancer under the age of 40 is 2%, and this
probability increases to 11% between the ages 40 and 50 in females
(1). Based on the types of cancers seen in these young age groups,

approximately half of these females may receive a cancer treatment
that would impact their future fertility. Thus, cancer treatment is
probably the most common known cause of premature ovarian
failure in the general population.
Some chemotherapeutic agents are more commonly associated
with gonadal damage. These include alkylating agents such as
cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, busulfan, nitrogen
mustard, and procarbazine (2). Although animal studies have
shown the direct impact of these agents on primordial follicle (PF)
reserve (3, 4), there is no real-time quantitative evidence of
chemotherapy in human ovary. Moreover, as new agents are
introduced to adjuvant setting, their long-term impact on human
ovary is extremely difficult to determine from short-term studies. If
the comparative ovarian toxicity of various chemotherapy agents is
known, those patients who wish to preserve their fertility can be
offered fertility-friendly regimens. A bioassay that can obviate
lengthy clinical trials and one that can quantify the ovarian impact
of chemotherapeutics would offer enormous benefit in drug
development and choice. We did this study to address the latter
need.
The severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse has a T
and B cell deficiency, allowing xenografting without tissue
rejection. Using immunodeficient mice, xenografting models have
been successfully used in the cancer field (5). We previously showed
that human PFs go through normal stages of maturation and
respond to hormone treatment in tissue xenografted to SCID mice
(6). Based on that earlier model, we aimed to develop a human
ovarian xenograft model to quantify and characterize the relative
impact of cancer drugs in vivo. At 24 weeks of gestational age, all
follicles in the fetal ovary are at primordial stage, providing an
opportunity to study the impact of chemotherapeutic agents on
ovarian reserve.

Reagents. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1;
CD31) goat polyclonal and Mouse Vasa Homologue (MVH) mouse
monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies
Inc.. Rabbit polyclonal phospho-histone H3 antibody was obtained from
Upstate USA Inc. DMEM-F12 was from Life Technologies (Invitrogen Co.).
Fluorescein-labeled GSL I–isolectin B4 was obtained from Vector Laboratories. Evans blue dye was from Sigma.
Animals. Female SCID mice 5 to 8 weeks old were obtained from
Jackson Laboratories. A total of 52 animals were used ( five to six
animals for each time point). The animals were maintained on a 12-h/
12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All
procedures involving the use of animals were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Medical College of Cornell
University.
Human ovarian tissue. Three pairs of 24-week-old human fetal ovaries
were used in the study. The ovaries were obtained during therapeutic
abortions and were provided by the Human Fetal Tissue Repository at the
Jacobi Medical Center of Albert Einstein University School of Medicine. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Weill Medical

Histomorphometric assessment and immunohistochemistry.
Paraffin-embedded sections were serially sectioned at 7-Am thickness to
determine PF density. PF density was determined from serial sections as
the mean of follicle counts per square millimeter in every fifth section.
For the determination of apoptosis in paraffin-embedded sections, TUNEL
(terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling) method was
used. PECAM-1 (CD31) staining was used for the assessment of graft
vascularization. Germ cell marker MVH and mitosis marker phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) were used for the identification of proliferating germ
cells.
Statistical analysis. The data were prospectively collected from three
experiments. For comparison of follicle counts, ANOVA was used. Graphic
bars were created using GrapPad Prism software. A P value <0.05 was
considered significant.

Xenografting and chemotherapy administration. Fetal ovaries were
first minced into 2  2-mm pieces in HEPES-buffered DMEM-F12 culture
media and maintained at 4jC until grafting. The animals were anesthetized
with ketamine-xylazine cocktail. Small subcutaneous pouches were created
bilaterally on the dorsum of the animals. Fetal ovarian pieces were
transplanted into the pockets followed by injection of 200 AL of Matrigel.
Two weeks after the transplantation, cyclophosphamide was administrated
at a single dose of 200 mg/kg i.p. The dose was chosen based on previous
work (7). Grafts were recovered at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postinjection. Control
animals received saline injection only.
Matrigel plug assay–intravital fluorescein dye injection–confocal
imaging of graft vasculature. The assay was done as described previously
(8). Matrigel is a solubilized basement membrane preparation and its major
component is laminin, followed by collagen IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and entactin (9). To visualize revascularization in the graft and
surrounding Matrigel, mice were injected with either 0.1 mL FITC–lectin
(100 Ag/mL) or 0.1 mL Evans blue (1% w/v) in PBS via the tail vein 30 min
before sacrifice to visualize vascular endothelium. Entire grafts were

Comparability of fetal ovarian tissue to postnatal ovarian
tissue. The mean number of PFs F SE/mm2 ( follicle density) was
35.6 F 3 in fetal ovaries of 24-week gestational age, which was
higher than those determined in 17- and 22-year-old patients (18.25
F 5.17 and 16.6 F 3.5, respectively). Furthermore, adjacent sections
of a 24-week-old fetal ovary were stained immunohistochemically
with germ cell marker MVH and mitosis marker phospho-histone
H3 (Ser10) to determine if germ cell mitosis still takes place in fetal
ovary at this gestational age. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, rare cells
were stained positive for both MVH (Fig. 1A) and phospho-histone
H3 (Fig. 1B).
These data indicate that whereas fetal ovarian tissue contains a
larger number of PFs compared with postnatal individuals, it
possesses all the elements of a mature ovary with the exception of
developing follicles. Although it is not identical to a postnatal
ovary, because the target of concern for chemotherapy agents is
PFs, fetal ovarian tissue should provide a suitable environment to
study the impact of chemotherapeutics on human ovarian reserve.
Graft vascularization and survival. Grafts were well vascularized 2 weeks post-transplantation (Fig. 2A). The microvasculature
was visualized by confocal microscopy following tail-vein injections
of Evans blue (Fig. 2B) and FITC-labeled lectin B4 (see Supplementary Figure). Xenografted tissue showed a CD31 staining
pattern similar to that of non-xenografted fetal tissue. Furthermore,
CD31-positive areas were filled with RBC showing functional
competency of the newly formed vessels (Fig. 2C and D). Consistent
with the full vascularization, ovarian histology was similar to nonxenografted ovaries with the exception of diminished PF density
(35.6 F 3 versus 4.8 F 0.8, pre- and post-xenografting, respectively;

Human Ovarian Xenograft to Test Human Toxicity of Chemotherapy

Figure 4. Comparison of PF density between control and cyclophosphamide
(CY )-treated xenografts. PF loss starts as early as 12 h postinjection and
peaks at 48 h. The follicle loss is only 12% at 12 h (P > 0.05), but significantly
increases at 24 h (53%, P < 0.01) and peaks at 48 h (93%, P < 0.0001).
Note the moderate increase in PF density from 48 to 72 h and, as a result,
attenuation in follicle loss to 70% at 72 h (P < 0.001).

Fig. 3). However, post-xenografting follicle density was similar to
two adult individuals at age 33, who had 5.66 F 0.9 and 5.23 F
1.1 PF/mm2, making our model even more comparable to adult
individuals.
Chemotherapy-induced follicle destruction. Grafts recovered
at 12 h after cyclophosphamide administration had a PF density
statistically similar to control grafts (mean F SE, 4.2 F 0.3 versus

4.8 F 0.8; P > 0.05). At 24 h, there was a significant decline in follicle
density in the treated grafts compared with controls (2.15 F 0.4
versus 4.62 F 0.4; P < 0.01; see Supplementary Table for median
values and ranges. At 48 h, follicle density further decreased in the
treated grafts in comparison to controls (0.31 F 0.1 versus 4.46 F
0.3; P < 0.0001). At 72 h post–drug injection, the number of PFs in
the treated grafts increased to 1.27 F 0.17. This increase was
statistically significant when compared with the follicles counted
in treated grafts at 48 h (1.27 F 0.17 versus 0.31 F 0.1; P < 0.05),
but it was still significantly lower than that of the control grafts at
72 h (1.27 F 0.17 versus 4.22 F 0.4; P < 0.001; Fig. 4).
When the follicle loss was expressed as percentage difference
between controls and treated animals, there was only a 12% loss
12 h following the treatment (P > 0.05). The follicle loss significantly
increased at 24 h (53%, P < 0.01), peaked at 48 h (93%, P < 0.0001),
and was reduced at 72 h (70%, P < 0.001; Fig. 4).
The intensity and frequency of TUNEL staining peaked earlier
than the reduction in PF density. The most extensive staining was
seen at 12 h, decreasing at 24 and 48 h, and fading at 72 h. At 12 h,
whereas in 100% of the TUNEL-positive follicles, the oocyte had
stained, only 63 F 11% showed pregranulosa cell staining. All
discernible oocytes and pregranulosa cells stained TUNEL positive
at 24 and 48 h. Less than 1% of follicles were TUNEL positive in
controls (Fig. 5).

Discussion
In this study, we reported a novel xenograft model to test the
ovarian toxicity of chemotherapeutics. Because of its use in the

treatment of a wide range of malignancies, including breast cancer,
leukemias, lymphomas, and soft tissue tumors, and because there
are ample clinical data on its gonadal toxicity (2), we chose
cyclophosphamide to validate our model.
Using this model, for the first time, we showed the time course
and mechanism of damage of cyclophosphamide in human ovary.
In this model, the injection of a single dose of cyclophosphamide
caused a 93% reduction in PF density in 48 h, confirming the
gonadotoxicity of this drug in vivo. Furthermore, we showed by
TUNEL assay that cyclophosphamide causes follicle damage by
apoptosis. TUNEL staining peaked at 12 h before a significant
decline occurred in PF number, indicating that ovarian follicle
damage is initiated almost immediately following exposure to
cyclophosphamide. As another novel finding, we also showed that
the apoptotic cell death affected oocytes before granulosa cells
following exposure to cyclophosphamide. Although all of the
oocytes were TUNEL positive 12 h after cyclophosphamide
exposure, only two-thirds of pregranulosa cells stained TUNEL
positive. In the subsequent time points, all granulosa cells and
oocytes were stained with TUNEL, indicating that the time course
for apoptotic death starts earlier for oocytes. Further research will
be needed to determine whether that is the oocyte death, which
leads to pregranulosa cell demise, or whether granulosa cells are
more resistant to genotoxic insult in humans.
The data that were obtained from our model are not only
consistent with the clinical experience based on the cessation of
menstruation but are also in keeping with cyclophosphamide’s
impact on rodent ovaries. At 200-mg/kg dose, cyclophosphamide
caused 87% reduction in PF counts 72 h after its administration to
mice (10).
Human xenograft models are highly validated in cancer research
and played a significant role in drug development in the past
25 years. For example, subcutaneous tumor models predicted
clinical response to cancer drugs with 90% certainty and the drug
resistance with 97% accuracy (5). Furthermore, a recent study
validated the cytotoxic impact of chemotherapeutics on human
testicular tissue in a similar xenograft model in nude mice (11).
Thus, xenografting seems to be a relevant model to test the impact
of cancer drugs on tumors and reproductive tissue.

It has been a dogma that PF reserve is established in utero in
humans, and that there is no regeneration postnatally (12).
However, this dogma has recently been challenged in rodents
(13, 14). Moreover, it is a common observation that many women
conceive years after experiencing premature menopause as a
result of high-dose chemotherapy (15) or even after idiopathic
premature ovarian failure (16). In this study, we incidentally
observed that the PF counts partially recovered 72 h after
chemotherapy. Although this observation raises the possibility of
PF regeneration in human ovary, this phenomenon can be specific
to fetal ovary. Fetal ovaries have a complete apparatus to function
at the adult level at this gestational age, but there can still be
remaining mitotic germ cells that can result in the regeneration of
follicles. Thus, whereas the use of adult tissue would have been
ideal in this model, it would not be practical to obtain healthy
human ovarian tissue from young females. Nevertheless, our
model can provide a relative assessment of the gonadotoxocity of
various chemotherapy agents so that clinicians can choose drugs
with lower likelihood of infertility when this is a concern for the
patient and when equally effective alternatives exist. There are,
however, potential limitations with our model. Fetal ovarian tissue
may not be entirely comparable to postnatal tissue because of the
presence of mitotic germ cells. Furthermore, access to fetal
ovarian tissue from midtrimester abortions may be limited. Our
model will also have to be validated using agents other than
cyclophosphamide. Overall, fetal ovarian xenografting is a
promising model to characterize the gonadotoxic effects of
current and emerging cancer drugs without the need for lengthy
clinical studies.
