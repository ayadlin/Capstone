Abstract
Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) catalyzes the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate but also elicits additional metabolic changes. Levels of both glutamate and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity have been shown to be affected in U87
glioblastoma cells or normal human astrocyte (NHA) cells expressing mutant IDH1, as compared with cells expressing wild-type
IDH1. In this study, we show how these phenomena are linked
through the effects of IDH1 mutation, which also reprograms
pyruvate metabolism. Reduced PDH activity in U87 glioblastoma
and NHA IDH1 mutant cells was associated with relative increases
in PDH inhibitory phosphorylation, expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3, and levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1a.
PDH activity was monitored in these cells by hyperpolarized
13
C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-MRS), which revealed

a reduction in metabolism of hyperpolarized 2-13C-pyruvate to
5-13C-glutamate, relative to cells expressing wild-type IDH1. 13CMRS also revealed a reduction in glucose ﬂux to glutamate in
IDH1 mutant cells. Notably, pharmacological activation of PDH
by cell exposure to dichloroacetate (DCA) increased production
of hyperpolarized 5-13C-glutamate in IDH1 mutant cells. Furthermore, DCA treatment also abrogated the clonogenic advantage conferred by IDH1 mutation. Using patient-derived mutant
IDH1 neurosphere models, we showed that PDH activity was
essential for cell proliferation. Taken together, our results established that the IDH1 mutation induces an MRS-detectable reprogramming of pyruvate metabolism, which is essential for cell
proliferation and clonogenicity, with immediate therapeutic
implications. Cancer Res; 75(15); 2999–3009. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

shown that intermediates of the glycolytic pathway are channeled
toward the synthesis of macromolecules that are essential for cell
growth and proliferation (6).
Beyond the metabolic reprogramming that occurs downstream
of oncogenic signaling, a powerful illustration of the role of
altered metabolism as a potential driver of tumorigenesis is the
discovery of tumors with somatic mutations in the metabolic
enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH; ref. 7). Speciﬁcally, the
cytosolic isoform of IDH, IDH1, is mutated in 70%–90% of lowgrade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM) and mitochondrial IDH2 is mutated in 20% of acute myeloid leukemia cases
(8). Wild-type IDH1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation
of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate (a-KG). The IDH1 mutation,
which commonly occurs at the R132 residue in the active site,
leads to a loss of wild-type enzyme activity and to a neomorphic
activity that catalyzes the reduction of a-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate
(2-HG; ref. 9). As a result, IDH1 mutant gliomas show signiﬁcantly elevated levels of 2-HG. In turn, 2-HG inhibits the activity
of several a-KG–dependent dioxygenases, including the Jmjc
domain histone demethylases and the TET family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, which play an essential role in epigenetic
modulation of gene expression. The epigenetic perturbations
induced by 2-HG interfere with cellular differentiation and proliferation, ultimately leading to tumorigenesis (8).
Interestingly, several studies have described additional changes
in cellular metabolism, beyond production of 2-HG (10–17).
Reitman and colleagues were the ﬁrst to perform a metabolomic
analysis of genetically engineered IDH1 mutant cells and associated wild-type controls. This revealed increased levels of several
amino acids and reduced levels of TCA cycle intermediates

Metabolic reprogramming is increasingly emerging as a new
hallmark of cancer (1). This reprogramming is frequently controlled by oncogenic signaling pathways in ways that support cell
growth and proliferation, and that are likely essential for malignant transformation (2, 3). The most extensively studied metabolic alteration is the "Warburg effect" (4) characterized by an
increase in glucose uptake and glucose metabolism to lactate
rather than full oxidation via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
even under conditions of high oxygen tension. The elevated levels
of lactate produced by cancer cells play an essential role in tumor
progression (5). Furthermore, recent studies in tumor cells have

including glutamate (10). Similar ﬁndings were made in a study
of patient samples (11). Furthermore, a noninvasive 1H-MRS
investigation of mutant IDH1-glioma patients reported that glutamate levels were lower compared with normal brain (12). In
line with these ﬁndings, the activity of three enzymes—branched
chain amino acid transferase 1 (BCAT-1), aspartate transaminase
(AST), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)—that catalyze the
conversion of a-KG to glutamate was shown to be lower in IDH1
mutant cells (13). Reitman and colleagues also noted a drop in
phosphocholine (PC) and an increase in glycerophosphocholine
(GPC) in IDH1 mutant cells (10) and analysis of ex vivo tumor
samples and animal models by MRS conﬁrmed the increase of
GPC (14). This observation is counter to the increase in PC and
drop in GPC typically observed in cancer (18) and possibly points
to metabolic alterations unique to mutant IDH1 tumors. Consistent with this idea, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) gene,
responsible for lactate production and typically overexpressed in
cancer, is silenced in IDH1 mutant gliomas (15) and IDH1
mutant cells appear to have a greater dependence on the TCA
cycle compared with wild-type cells (16, 17).
In our laboratory, we have studied two genetically engineered
cell models that overexpress either wild-type IDH1 or mutant
IDH1: a U87 GBM-derived model and an immortalized normal
human astrocyte (NHA)-derived model. We used 1H-MRS to
analyze the metabolomic signature associated with the IDH1
mutation and, consistent with previous work, found that it was
associated with an MRS-detectable increase in GPC and drop in
PC, lactate, and glutamate (19). We also used hyperpolarized
13
C-MRS, a novel metabolic imaging approach that can rapidly
monitor metabolic ﬂuxes (20–23) and showed that we could
detect elevated ﬂux from a-KG to 2-HG (24) and reduced ﬂux
from a-KG to glutamate (13) in mutant IDH1 tumors compared
with wild-type. In a separate study, we observed that the activity of
PDH, the enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate
to acetyl CoA prior to entry into the TCA cycle, was also reduced in
IDH1 mutant cells (25). This led us to question the role of PDH in
IDH1 mutant cells.
Here, we investigated our two genetically engineered cell models and ﬁrst conﬁrmed that downregulation of PDH activity is
mediated in both our models by a 2-HG–dependent increase in
hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) levels. Using 13C-MRS and
hyperpolarized 13C-MRS, we then conﬁrmed that glucose ﬂux via
PDH was reduced in IDH1 mutant cells compared with wild-type.
Importantly, we found that pharmacological activation of PDH
not only altered metabolism but also abrogated the mutant IDH1mediated clonogenicity of our cells and inhibited proliferation
of patient-derived mutant IDH1 neurospheres. Our results thus
suggest that the IDH1 mutation induces an MRS-detectable reprogramming of pyruvate metabolism via PDH that is essential for
tumorigenesis and that could serve as a possible target for treatment of mutant IDH1 tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U87 and NHA cell lines expressing wild-type IDH1 (U87IDHwt
and NHAIDHwt) or IDH1 R132H mutant gene (U87IDHmut and
NHAIDHmut) were generated and maintained as described previously (19, 24). All cell lines were authenticated by single
nucleotide polymorphism ﬁngerprinting and IDH1 mutational
status was veriﬁed by Western blotting as described earlier (19).

3000 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

BT54 and BT142 cells were grown as neurospheres in serum-free
medium (NeuroCult, Stemcell technologies) as described previously (26, 27). To probe the effect of DCA, cells were treated with
10 mmol/L DCA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours. To probe the role
of 2-HG, NHAIDHwt cells were treated with 10 mmol/L 2-HG
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 days and U87IDHwt cells were permeabilized with 0.01% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes prior to treatment with
30 mmol/L 2-HG for 24 hours.
PDH activity and phosphorylation assays
PDH activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay
(Abcam) and normalized to cell number. PDH phosphorylation
was measured using an ELISA Kit (Abcam; ref. 25) and normalized
to cell number.
Expression analysis
mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis
and normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript (25). For Western blotting, cellular
protein (20 mg) was probed for PDK1 (Abcam), PDK3 (Proteintech), and HIF1a (Cell Signaling) and visualized using an
Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrate Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Actin (Cell Signaling) and b-tubulin (Cell Signaling) were used as
loading controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) for HIF1a detection.
Clonogenicity
Clonogenicity of U87 and NHA cells was measured using a soft
agar assay (28) in the presence of 10 mmol/L DCA or water
(vehicle control).
Proliferation of mutant IDH1 glioma lines
BT54 and BT142 neurospheres were dissociated and 2.5  105
cells/well placed in 6-well plates with medium containing
10 mmol/L DCA or water for 12 and 7 days, respectively. Media
and drug were replenished every 72 hours. At the end of the study,
neurospheres were dissociated and number of cells determined.
MRS of live cells
U87 and NHA cells were grown on beads, BT142 neurospheres
were encapsulated in agarose, and all MRS studies were performed
using an MR-compatible cell perfusion system as described (29–
31). All studies were performed on a 500 MHz INOVA spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). For 13C-MRS studies glucose
or glutamine in the medium were replaced with 5 mmol/L
1-13C-glucose or 2 mmol/L 3-13C-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and
spectra acquired using 60 ﬂip angle (FA), 6s repetition time (TR),
and 15 minutes acquisition time. For hyperpolarized 13C-MRS,
2-13C-pyruvic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was hyperpolarized using the
Hypersense DNP polarizer (Oxford Instruments), injected into
the perfusion system to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mmol/L
pyruvate, and dynamic sets of 13C-MRS spectra acquired using
5 FA and 3s TR over 300 seconds. All peak integrals were
quantiﬁed using Mnova (Mestrelab Research). For thermally
polarized 13C-MRS, peaks were normalized to cell number and
initial 13C-substrate concentrations. For hyperpolarized 13C-MRS
studies, total glutamate signal was normalized to total pyruvate
signal and cell number.

IDH1 Mutation Downregulates Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Activity

MRS of cell extracts
U87 and NHA cells were grown in media containing 1-13Cglucose (5 mmol/L) or 3-13C-glutamine (2 mmol/L) for 24 hours.
BT54 and BT142 neurospheres were grown in Neurocult media
with 35 mmol/L 1-13C-glucose for 15 days. Metabolites were
extracted by dual phase extraction (19). 1H-MRS spectra (1D
water presaturation ZGPR sequence, 90 FA, 3s TR, 256 acquisitions) and proton-decoupled 13C-MRS spectra (30 FA, 3s TR,
2048 acquisitions) were acquired using a 500 MHz Avance
spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin), equipped with a Triple Resonance
CryoProbe. Metabolites were quantiﬁed by normalizing to a
trimethylsilyl propanoic acid reference of known concentration
and correcting for saturation and Nuclear Overhauser effect.
Statistical analysis
All studies were performed at least three times and results are
expressed as mean  standard deviation. Statistical signiﬁcance
was evaluated using a two-tailed Student t-test assuming unequal
variance with P < 0.05 considered signiﬁcant.

Results
PDH activity is downregulated in IDH1 mutant cells in a 2-HG–
dependent manner
PDH is a rate-limiting metabolic checkpoint for oxidation of
glucose via the TCA cycle (32). We previously found a signiﬁcant
reduction in PDH activity in NHAIDHmut cells compared with
NHAIDHwt (130  16  1010 OD/h/cell in NHAIDHwt to 28 
5  1010 OD/h/cell in NHAIDHmut, P < 0.005; Supplementary
Table S1), associated with inhibitory phosphorylation of PDH
(25). To assess the importance of PDH in IDH1 mutant cells, we
ﬁrst sought to conﬁrm our ﬁndings in a second genetically
engineered model.
We found that PDH activity was signiﬁcantly reduced in
U87IDHmut cells compared with U87IDHwt (75  6%, P <
0.005; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, and
similar to the NHA model (25), this was associated with increased
phosphorylation of Ser293 (93  26%, P < 0.05) and Ser300
(71  19%, P < 0.005) (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of Ser232 was
comparable. Given that PDH activity is regulated by inhibitory
phosphorylation via pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK;
ref. 32), we examined mRNA and protein levels of all four PDKs
(PDK1–PKD4). Again, similar to the NHA model (25), we found
that PDK1 and PDK3 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly higher in

U87IDHmut cells relative to U87IDHwt by 183  82% (P < 0.05)
for PDK1 and 100  26% (P < 0.05) for PDK3 (Fig. 1C). A small 18
 2% (P < 0.05) drop was observed in PDK2 mRNA, but no
change was detected in the NHA model and hence was not
investigated further. PDK4 mRNA was below detection in both
models.
Next, we examined protein expression for PDK1 and PDK3 by
Western blotting. PDK3 expression was higher in IDH1 mutant
cells compared with IDH1 wild-type for both U87 and NHA
models (Fig. 2A and 2B; 56  16%, P < 0.01 for U87 and 71  3%,
P < 0.001 for NHA), consistent with increased phosphorylation of
Ser293 and Ser300, the targets of PDK3. Expression of PDK1,
known to phosphorylate Ser232, was unchanged in both models,
consistent with the unchanged Ser232 phosphorylation.
In cancer, PDK3 expression is typically upregulated by
HIF1a, leading to a drop in PDH activity and contributing to
the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (33).
We therefore determined HIF1a expression in our cells. Our
results (Fig. 2C and D) indicated that HIF1a levels were higher
in IDH1 mutant cells compared with wild-type for both U87
and NHA models (32  4%, P < 0.005 for U87 and 42  21%,
P < 0.05 for NHA).
To conﬁrm that increased HIF1a and PDK3 levels and reduced
PDH activity were associated with mutant IDH1-induced 2-HG
production, we measured PDH activity in NHAIDHwt and
U87IDHwt cells treated with exogenous 2-HG, previously shown
to model the effect of the IDH1 mutation (10, 34, 35). The
presence of 2-HG did not alter cell proliferation in either the
U87 or NHA models (Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly, 2-HG
treatment did induce a signiﬁcant reduction in PDH activity by 48
 18% (P < 0.05) in the U87 model (Fig. 2E) and by 45  11%
(P < 0.05) in the NHA model (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, Western
blotting revealed increased levels of PDK3 (Fig. 2G and H, 83 
36, P < 0.05 for U87 and 75  9%, P < 0.0005 for NHA) and HIF1a
(Fig. 2I and J, 41  8%, P < 0.005 for U87 and 82  35%, P < 0.05
for NHA) in 2-HG-treated cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings
suggested that higher HIF1a levels in IDH1 mutant cells lead to
elevated expression of PDK3, likely resulting in reduced PDH
activity.
Reduced PDH activity results in a 13C-MRS detectable change in
hyperpolarized pyruvate metabolism
To conﬁrm that the drop in PDH activity also results in a
drop in pyruvate ﬂux, we used 13C-MRS to investigate live cells

and dynamically probe the fate of hyperpolarized 2-13C-pyruvate, which is metabolized via PDH, enters the TCA cycle and
is converted into 5-13C-glutamate (36). Build-up of hyperpolarized 5-13C-glutamate was readily detectable in our cells
(Fig. 3A and B) and its quantiﬁcation indicated that it was
signiﬁcantly reduced in IDH1 mutant cells compared with
wild-type. 5-13C-glutamate dropped by 24  16% (P <
0.001) in U87IDHmut cells (Fig. 3C) and by 76  22% (P <
0.0001) in NHAIDHmut cells (Fig. 3D). This conﬁrmed that
the drop in PDH activity reduced pyruvate ﬂux into the TCA
cycle and pointed to a possible role for PDH in modulating
cellular glutamate levels.

Glutamate production from glucose is reduced in IDH1
mutant cells
To assess the effect of reduced PDH activity on glutamate
levels, we probed the synthesis of glutamate from 1-13C-glucose
and 3-13C-glutamine—its two main metabolic precursors
(Fig. 4A). Following 3-13C-glutamine perfusion, we detected
build-up of 3-13C-glutamate (27.8 ppm) and 3-13C-2-HG
(31.6 ppm) in U87IDHmut cells, whereas, as expected, only
glutamate labeling was detected in U87IDHwt cells (Fig. 4B).
Following 1-13C-glucose perfusion, we detected production of
3-13C-lactate (21.0 ppm) in both IDH1 wild-type and mutant
cells, but no difference in 3-13C-lactate production was

observed between U87IDHwt and U87IDHmut cells. We also
detected a signal at 34.2 ppm, which based on chemical shift,
could represent either 4-13C-glutamate, 4-13C-2-HG, or both
(Fig. 4C). Because the resolution of the 13C-MRS data from cells
was not sufﬁcient to interpret the peak at 34.2 ppm, we turned
to extracting our cells following incubation with 1-13C-glucose
and used this data to determine the buildup of glutamate
(Fig. 4C right inset). The extracts demonstrated that 1-13Cglucose was incorporated into both 4-13C-glutamate and
4-13C-2-HG (at a ratio of 69  13%) in the U87IDHmut cells
(Fig. 4C left inset) but, as expected, only 4-13C-glutamate was
labeled in U87IDHwt cells.
We also quantiﬁed the total cellular concentration of glutamate
using 1H-MRS and compared with the 13C-MRS data at the end
of our study. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, the sum total of glutamate
produced from glucose and glutamine, as determined from 13CMRS data, was within experimental error of the total pool of
glutamate determined by 1H-MRS in both U87IDHwt (5.9 
0.8 fmol/cell) and U87IDHmut (2.5  0.7 fmol/cell) cells. In
U87IDHwt cells, 1.0  0.2 fmol/cell of glutamate was derived
from 1-13C-glucose and 4.9  0.8 fmol/cell was derived from 3-13Cglutamine. In U87IDHmut cells, 0.20  0.01 fmol/cell was

www.aacrjournals.org

derived from 1-13C-glucose and 2.2  0.4 fmol/cell from 3-13Cglutamine.
To analyze the precursors of glutamate in the NHA model, we
directly resorted to investigating extracts of cells incubated with
1-13C-glucose and 3-13C-glutamine and compared our ﬁndings
with the total glutamate pool determined by 1H-MRS. In
NHAIDHwt cells, of 6.6  1.2 fmol/cell glutamate, 3.3 
0.5 fmol/cell was produced from 1-13C-glucose and 1.7  0.5
fmol/cell from 3-13C-glutamine. In NHAIDHmut cells, of 3.5 
0.6 fmol/cell, 1.6  0.4 fmol/cell was produced from 1-13Cglucose whereas 1.8  0.3 fmol/cell was produced from 3-13Cglutamine (Fig. 5B). Similar to the U87 model, the sum of the 13Clabeled pools accounted for the total pool of glutamate in both
NHAIDHwt and NHAIDHmut cells.
When considering the contribution of labeled glutamine and
glucose to the total pool of glutamate, we found that U87IDHmut
cells displayed a signiﬁcant drop in glutamine-derived glutamate
compared with U87IDHwt cells (4.9  0.8 fmol/cell vs. 2.2  0.4
fmol/cell, P < 0.05; Fig. 5A) but no such reduction was observed in
the NHA model (1.7  0.5 fmol/cell vs. 1.8  0.3 fmol/cell, P ¼
0.4; Fig. 5B). In contrast, a signiﬁcant reduction in glucose-derived
glutamate occurred in both U87 (1.0  0.2 fmol/cell versus 0.20 

versus 1.6  0.4 fmol/cell, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B) models. We cannot
rule out small contributions to the total glutamate pool from
another source. For example, glutamate, which has been shown to
enhance the growth of IDH1 mutant gliomas (37), could be
imported into the cell via the excitatory amino acid transporter-2. However, the drop in glucose-derived glutamate was sufﬁcient, within experimental error, to explain the full drop in cellular
glutamate levels in the NHA model. This points to a role for
glucose-derived glutamate, and thus PDH, in explaining the drop
in glutamate levels in IDH1 mutant cells.
Glucose contributes to 2-HG synthesis
Previous work indicated glutamine as the major source of
2-HG (38). Interestingly, our data indicated that glucose also
contributes signiﬁcantly to 2-HG production (Fig. 5C). Speciﬁcally, in U87IDHmut, of 0.67  0.19 fmol/cell total 2-HG, 0.11 
0.01 fmol/cell was derived from 1-13C-glucose whereas 0.49 
0.11 fmol/cell was derived from 3-13C-glutamine. In NHAIDH-

3004 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

mut cells, of 6.3  1.5 fmol/cell 2-HG, 1.3  0.7 fmol/cell was
derived from 1-13C-glucose and 4.7  1.3 fmol/cell from 3-13Cglutamine. In both U87IDHmut and NHAIDHmut cells, the sum
of glucose- and glutamine-derived fractions accounted for the
total 2-HG pool.
DCA inhibits clonogenicity of IDH1 mutant cells
Next, we wanted to assess whether the reduction in PDH
activity in IDH1 mutant cells has any biological signiﬁcance.
We used DCA—a PDK inhibitor that activates PDH activity—
to assess the effect of PDH activation (32). We chose a
concentration of 10 mmol/L DCA based on previous work
(e.g., ref. 39) and ﬁrst conﬁrmed that, at this concentration,
DCA did not signiﬁcantly inhibit cell growth in any of our cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). We then assessed target modulation by measuring PDH activity. Our results (Fig. 6A and B)
indicate that DCA induced activation of PDH most effectively
in IDH1 mutant cells. PDH activity increased by 730  219%
(P < 0.005) in U87IDHmut, by 41  26% (P < 0.05) in

NHAIDHwt cells (Fig. 6B).
Next, we conﬁrmed the effect of DCA on metabolism using
hyperpolarized 13C-MRS. Hyperpolarized 5-13C-glutamate
increased by 142  76% (P < 0.05) in U87IDHmut and by
43  30% (P < 0.05) in U87IDHwt (Fig. 6C). It increased by

Finally, we tested the effect of DCA on clonogenicity. In the
U87 model, both IDH1 wild-type and mutant cells readily
formed colonies on soft agar and DCA inhibited clonogenicity
equally in U87IDHwt (46  10%, P < 0.01) and U87IDHmut
(44  8%, P < 0.05), likely reﬂecting the GBM background of

this model and pointing to a limited growth advantage associated with PDH downregulation in these cells (Fig. 6E). In the
NHA model, consistent with its effect on PDH activity, DCA
had a clear inhibitory effect on NHAIDHmut cells with a very
signiﬁcant drop of 86  2% (P < 0.005) in the number of
colonies (Fig. 6F). In the case of NHAIDHwt, the number of
colonies produced was also smaller but the effect barely signiﬁcant (57  11%, P ¼ 0.05). Furthermore, we noted that in
the absence of DCA, NHAIDHmut cells showed a signiﬁcant
834  187% (P < 0.005) increase in colony formation on soft
agar compared with NHAIDHwt (Fig. 6F). However, DCA
completely abrogated the effect of the IDH1 mutation, resulting
in equivalent colony numbers for untreated NHAIDHwt and
DCA-treated NHAIDHmut cells (8  2 vs. 11  3, P ¼ 0.2;
Fig. 6F). These results highlighted the importance of PDH
downregulation for IDH1 mutation-induced tumorigenesis in
the NHA model.
PDH is essential for proliferation of patient-derived mutant
IDH1 neurospheres
In order to conﬁrm our ﬁndings in clinically relevant models,
we extended our studies to the BT54 and BT142 patient-derived
mutant IDH1 neurosphere models (26, 27). In a small study,
we assessed the contribution of glucose to the total glutamate
and 2-HG pools. As in the case of our genetically engineered
models, we used 1-13C-glucose labeling followed by metabolite
extraction and 13C-MRS to determine the contribution of glucose
to glutamate and 2-HG production. 1H-MRS was used to measure
the total glutamate and 2-HG pools. We found that glucose
contributed 0.18 fmol/cell out of a total glutamate pool of
0.6 fmol/cell (n ¼ 1) in the BT54 model. In the BT142 model,
0.2 fmol/cell of glutamate came from glucose out of a total of 0.43
fmol/cell (n ¼ 1). In the case of 2-HG, we found that in BT54 cells,
0.08 fmol/cell out of a total 2-HG pool of 0.22 fmol/cell was
derived from glucose (n ¼ 1). In BT142 cells, 2-HG levels were too
low to be accurately quantiﬁed by MRS, consistent with previous
studies (27).
We then treated with DCA and found that it activated PDH by
28  10% (P < 0.05) in BT54 and by 49  20% (P < 0.05) in BT142
cells (Fig. 7A). We then used hyperpolarized 2-13C-pyruvate to
study metabolism in the relatively faster growing BT142 model

3006 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

and conﬁrmed that increased PDH activity resulted in elevated
hyperpolarized 5-13C-glutamate production by 170  72%
(P < 0.001, Fig. 7B). Finally, we determined that DCA signiﬁcantly
inhibited neurosphere proliferation by 50  5% (P < 0.05) and
37  14% (P < 0.05) in BT54 and BT142 cells, respectively (Fig.
7C). Collectively, our ﬁndings in the patient-derived mutant
IDH1 models conﬁrmed our observations in genetically engineered IDH1 mutant cells.

Discussion
Targeting metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells is increasingly being considered as a therapeutic option (3, 40). In the
context of the IDH1 mutation, several studies have cataloged
the metabolic changes associated with mutant IDH (10–17),
but the biological signiﬁcance and therapeutic potential of
these changes is not fully understood. Here, we focused on
the enzyme PDH and found that PDH activity and glucose ﬂux
towards glutamate were reduced in genetically engineered
IDH1 mutant cells compared with wild-type. Furthermore, we
found that activation of PDH, both in our genetically engineered and in patient-derived mutant IDH1 models, signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation and clonogenicity, pointing to an
essential role for PDH.
Reduced PDH activity was likely mediated in our cells by
elevated levels of HIF1a, which led to downstream activation of
PDK3 expression. The PDKs are highly speciﬁc regulators of PDH
activity (32). Although several glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes
often moonlight as transcriptional or apoptotic regulators, no
such activity has been reported for the PDKs. Therefore, the
increased expression of PDK3 observed in our studies is likely
responsible for the increased inhibitory phosphorylation of PDH,
resulting in reduced PDH activity.
Previous work indicates that mutant IDH1 tumors reprogram their metabolism differently from wild-type IDH1 glioblastoma (11, 15). Nonetheless, our ﬁndings regarding PDH
are consistent with observations in most cancer cells, wherein
HIF1a upregulates expression of PDK1 and PDK3, which
mediate inhibitory phosphorylation of PDH (33). Importantly, these can be directly linked to mutant IDH. Mutant IDH1
via 2-HG production can stabilize HIF1a levels by inhibiting

IDH1 Mutation Downregulates Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Activity

a-KG–dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHD; ref. 34). Koivunen and colleagues (41) showed that introduction of the
IDH1 mutation or addition of 2-HG to cell lines resulted in
diminished HIF1a levels and reduced expression of HIF1a
target genes. However, in contrast, and in line with our
ﬁndings, two other studies showed that expression of mutant
IDH1 or 2-HG treatment in U87 cells elevated HIF1a levels
and increased expression of HIF1a target genes, and this effect
was abrogated by treatment with an IDH1 inhibitor (34, 42).
Furthermore, and also consistent with our observations, Sasaki
and colleagues observed that HIF1a levels and target genes
were upregulated in brain tissue from IDH1 R132H knock-in
mice (43).
In most cancer cells, upregulated HIF1a expression results in
increased LDHA expression (33). Therefore, U87 and NHA IDH1
mutant cells might be expected to show increased LDHA expression relative to wild-type cells. However, Chesnelong and colleagues (15) demonstrated that the LDHA gene in IDH1 mutant
glioma cells is silenced by methylation of CpG sites within the
promoter. Therefore, elevated HIF1a expression in IDH1 mutant
cells might not translate to increased LDHA expression. Indeed,
expression of LDHA was not signiﬁcantly altered in our NHAIDHmut cells compared with NHAIDHwt cells (15), nor have we
observed any alteration in LDHA expression in our U87 model.
Our data indicate that PDH activity is 10-fold higher in
NHA (akin to low-grade gliomas) and BT142 models compared
with U87 GBM (Supplementary Table S1). This is consistent
with a recent study demonstrating a 10-fold reduction in spare
respiratory capacity in high-grade GBMs compared with SV-40
immortalized human astrocytes, associated with modulation of
PDH activity (44). Thus, although the IDH1 mutation leads to
reduced PDH activity and ﬂux to the TCA cycle, this ﬂux
remains higher in the NHA and BT models than in high-grade
GBMs and points to a greater dependence on the TCA cycle in
mutant IDH1 low-grade glioma compared with GBM. Our
ﬁndings are thus consistent with observations showing that
HIF1a target genes are underexpressed in mutant IDH1 patientderived models (including BT54 and BT142) compared with
primary GBM models wild-type for IDH1 (15) and concur with
observations of reduced PDH activity in engineered IDH1
mutant colorectal cancer cells (16). Reduced ﬂux through the
TCA cycle would allow IDH1 mutant cells to divert carbon
precursors towards macromolecular biosynthesis, even if these
cells proliferate slower than GBM (6).
In our studies, we used the classic PDK inhibitor, DCA, to
understand the biological signiﬁcance of reduced PDH activity
in IDH1 mutant cells. DCA is a pyruvate mimetic and its crystal
structures with PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3 show binding at the
enzymatic active site. Moreover, siRNA-mediated inhibition of
some PDKs mimics the effect of DCA, further conﬁrming its
speciﬁcity (45). Finally, although DCA is known to induce
DNA hypomethylation in mouse liver, its general lack of
toxicity in patients suggests a fairly selective mechanism of
action (45).
Following DCA treatment, we found that clonogenicity was
inhibited equally for U87IDHwt and U87IDHmut cells. This
ﬁnding concurs with the reported efﬁcacy of DCA against GBM
(46) and with the fact that lower baseline PDH activity in the
U87 GBM background allows for a response even in IDH1 wildtype cells. It is also consistent with the fact that introduction of
the IDH1 mutation did not increase the clonogenicity of the

www.aacrjournals.org

cells and thus a differential effect of DCA on clonogenicity
would not be expected. In contrast, in the NHA model, introduction of the IDH1 mutation signiﬁcantly increased clonogenicity, and, importantly, this effect was completely abrogated
by DCA treatment. We also conﬁrmed that DCA inhibited
growth of patient-derived neurospheres. Our data thus suggest
that the reprogramming of PDH activity by the IDH1 mutation
is crucial for tumorigenesis and to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst report of the efﬁcacy of DCA against low-grade
mutant IDH1 glioma cells.
Our studies also shed light on the different factors contributing
to reduced glutamate levels in IDH1 mutant gliomas (10–13, 19).
A drop in BCAT-1, GDH, and AST activity contribute to this
reduction (13). However, our studies show that the drop in PDH
ﬂux into the TCA cycle and reduced contribution of glucose to
glutamate synthesis also contribute to the lower levels of glutamate in IDH1 mutant cells.
Our data also indicate that some 2-HG can be derived from
glucose, in addition to its production from glutamine previously
reported (38). Reducing 2-HG production by inhibiting glutaminolysis is being explored as a therapeutic option (47). In this
context, recognizing that glucose can also serve as a source of
2-HG is important.
Finally, our study highlights the value of MRS in probing
metabolic reprogramming in IDH1 mutant cells as well as their
response to therapies that target metabolism. 1H-MRS is a
noninvasive method used to monitor metabolite levels in
preclinical models and human patients (48). It has been used
to probe for elevated 2-HG levels (49–52). It was also used
to detect reduced glutamate levels in patients with mutant
IDH1 tumors (12), and our study mechanistically validates
reduced glutamate as a potential complementary metabolic
biomarker of mutant IDH1 tumors. In addition, hyperpolarized 13C-MRS can be used to monitor metabolic ﬂuxes (13, 22–
24). We have previously used hyperpolarized 13C-MRS to
image 2-HG production in tumors expressing mutant IDH1
(24). We have also shown that we can detect a reduction in
a-KG to glutamate conversion that occurs as part of the metabolic reprogramming of mutant IDH1 tumors (13). Our
current ﬁndings point to the value of hyperpolarized 2-13Cpyruvate and its conversion to glutamate as another potential
complementary imaging approach for mutant IDH1 tumors.
Importantly, hyperpolarized pyruvate has been used clinically
(23) and the effect of DCA on hyperpolarized pyruvate metabolism has been detected in rat brain (53).
In summary, our study demonstrates that reprogramming of
PDH activity is essential for mutant IDH1 cell proliferation, that
MRS can be used to detect this reprogramming, and that modulation of PDH activity could potentially serve as a therapeutic
approach for mutant IDH1 tumors.
