Abstract
Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) blockade offers a
new targeted therapy particularly in those cancers with MET
ampliﬁcation. However, the efﬁcacy and the duration of the
response to MET inhibitors are limited by the emergence of
drug resistance. Here, we report that resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of MET can arise from increased expression of
the prosurvival Pim protein kinases. This resistance mechanism
was documented in non–small cell lung cancer and gastric
cancer cells with MET ampliﬁcation. Inhibition of Pim kinases
enhanced cell death triggered by short-term treatment with
MET inhibitors. Pim kinases control the translation of anti-

apoptotic protein Bcl-2 at an internal ribosome entry site and
this mechanism was identiﬁed as the basis for Pim-mediated
resistance to MET inhibitors. Protein synthesis was increased in
drug-resistant cells, secondary to a Pim-mediated increase in
cap-independent translation. In cells rendered drug resistant
by chronic treatment with MET inhibitors, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Pim kinases was sufﬁcient to restore
sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results
rationalize Pim inhibition as a strategy to augment responses
and blunt acquired resistance to MET inhibitors in cancer.

Introduction

activation of MET–HGF signaling occurs through multiple
mechanisms, including gene ampliﬁcation, mutation, protein
overexpression, and increased autocrine or paracrine ligand-mediated stimulation (5, 6). Dozens of selective and nonselective MET
inhibitors are under clinical evaluation (7, 8). In recent clinical
studies, high MET protein expression correlated with a worse
prognosis (9), and in these studies patients with elevated levels
of MET in their tumors derived the most beneﬁt from treatment
with MET inhibitors (9). In a recent case report, a patient with non–
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a de novo MET ampliﬁcation
and no anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement
achieved rapid response to crizotinib (10), a small-molecule
inhibitor of MET and ALK. Clinical improvement and radiographic
regression have also been reported in patients with MET-ampliﬁed
esophagogastric adenocarcinoma who received crizotinib (11).
However, despite these promising results, widespread efﬁcacy was
not seen in several completed phase II studies (7), suggesting novel
therapeutic strategies that could overcome resistance to these
agents are needed. Preclinical models of drug resistance to the
MET inhibitors have identiﬁed several potential mechanisms of
resistance development, including activation of HER family members (12, 13), MET and KRAS gene ampliﬁcation (14), and the
acquisition of a mutation in the MET activation loop (Y1230H;
ref. 15). Multiple mechanisms could arise simultaneously in a
single patient to allow for MET resistance (15).
Pim kinases are serine/threonine kinases that are constitutively
active in cells (16, 17) and the activity of Pim kinases is largely
regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels (18).
Recently, we have shown that Pim-1 is an important regulator
of MET expression and signaling through the regulation of protein
translation, in part, mediated by the ability of Pim to control the
phosphorylation of eIF4B (19). The Pim family of serine/threonine kinases is known to modulate cell survival pathways, regulate
the progression and growth of human cancers, and induce resistance to chemotherapy (18, 20). Increased Pim levels have been
shown to phosphorylate BH3 protein BAD and sequester its

The concept of "oncogene addiction," whereby cancer cells
become dependent on a speciﬁc oncogenic signaling pathway
for survival (1), is highlighted by the recent success of molecularly
targeted agents (2). However, the initial enthusiasm over substantial clinical responses has now been tempered by the bedside
observation that these responses are not durable because tumors
acquire drug resistance (2, 3). The identiﬁcation of resistance
mechanisms is essential to developing a strategy to enhance
targeted therapy and prolong the efﬁcacy of these agents.
Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor is the receptor
for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; refs. 4, 5). It has been implicated in uncontrolled cell survival, growth, angiogenesis, and
metastasis, all of which are hallmarks of cancer (6). Aberrant

activity blocking apoptosis (16, 21, 22). Small-molecule AKT
inhibitors induce dramatic upregulation of Pim-1 expression,
and Pim-1 then functions to increase expression of a subset of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that play an important part in the
resistance to these drugs (23).
Here, we examine the role of Pim kinases in the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to small-molecule MET
inhibitors in cells and tumors with MET ampliﬁcation and,
thus, addiction to the MET signaling pathway. On the basis of
this evidence, we explore the activity of combining MET and
Pim inhibitors to overcome cancer resistance to MET inhibitor
therapy.

Immunoblotting
Cells were harvested in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmol/L Tris
pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5 mmol/L EDTA. Following 30-minute incubation in lysis buffer at 4 C, lysates were
cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C,
then protein concentrations were determined by DC Protein Assay
(Bio-Rad).
Luciferase assays
Fireﬂy luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured
using a luminometer (Model TD 20/20; Turner Designs) and the
reagents provided with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Kit
(Promega).
7-Methyl-GTP cap binding assay
After treatment, 5  105 cells were washed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in lysis buffer. After
centrifugation (16,000  g for 10 minutes at 4 C), 200 mg of
protein was applied to 20 mL of Immobilized g-aminophenyl-7methyl-guanosine 50 -triphosphate (m7GTP) agarose beads (Jena
Bioscience, Germany) and incubated for 3 hours at 4 C. The beads

expressed as the percentage of surviving cells compared with
control. This was calculated from the absorbance corrected for
background.
Methionine incorporation assay
Cells were labeled with 20 mCi of [35S]methionine per mL
(Easytag Express Protein Labeling Mix; PerkinElmer) in RPMI1640 for 1 hour, after which cold methionine was added. Three
hours prior to labeling DMSO, or PHA665752 (1 mmol/L), or
LGB321 (1 mmol/L), or BEZ235 (0.5 mmol/L) was added. After
completion of the experiment, the cells were washed twice with
PBS and lysed in lysis buffer A. Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13,000  g and a fraction was used for
precipitation with trichloroacetic acid on glass microﬁber ﬁlters
(Whatman) using vacuum ﬁltration, and 35S-incorporation was
measured by scintillation counting and normalized to total
protein amount. The rest of lysates were applied to SDS-PAGE
and the 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography.
Measurement of global RNA synthesis
Global RNA synthesis was measured by the Click-iT RNA Alexa
Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Life Technologies) based on the biosynthetic incorporation of the uridine analogue 5-ethynyluridine
(EU) into newly transcribed RNA. The modiﬁed RNA was detected
with Alexa Fluor 488 azide (green ﬂuorescence). Hoechst 33342
dye was used as a nuclear counterstain (blue ﬂuorescence). All
experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope. Quantitative analysis was performed by normalizing the
intensity of green signal to that of the blue signal using the ImageJ
software.
Flow cytometry apoptosis analysis
Appropriately treated EBC-1 or MKN45 cells were stained with
PE Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) following the
manufacture's instruction (BD Biosciences). The data were
acquired using a BD LSRFortessa and analyzed with FlowJo
software.
Combination index analysis
Combination effects were evaluated with the XTT assay at a
nonﬁxed ratio (Pim inhibitor AZD1208 was given at 1 mmol/L) in
EBC-1 and MKN45 cells. The fraction affected (Fa; for example.
Fa of 0.25 is equivalent to 75% viable cells) and combination
index values were processed using CompuSyn software (www.
combosyn.com). Combination index values of less than one,
equal to one and greater than one were taken to indicate synergism, additive effect and antagonism, respectively.
Animal experiments
Four- to 6-week-old nu/nu nude male mice were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories. All studies were performed in
compliance with institutional guidelines under an Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)–approved protocol.
For in vivo resistance model, EBC-1 xenograft tumors were
established in nude mice by subcutaneously injecting 5 
106 cells suspended in PBS into the right ﬂank. Mice with
well-established tumors were selected and randomized 10 days
after implantation (size > 150 mm3). Mice were treated with
vehicle or AZD6094 (25 mg/kg/d) by oral gavage once daily for

6 days a week. For combined therapy, EBC-1AZDR xenograft
tumors were established in nude mice by subcutaneously
injecting 5  106 cells suspended in PBS into the right ﬂank.
Mice were treated with vehicle, or AZD6094 (20 mg/kg/d), or
AZD1208 (25 mg/kg/d), or the combination of AZD6094 and
AZD1208 by oral gavage once daily for 6 days a week. All drugs
were dissolved in 0.5% HPMC/0.1% Tween 80. Tumor dimensions were measured with a caliper and tumor volumes calculated [tumor volume (mm3) ¼ (length  width2)/2].
Statistical analysis
The results of quantitative studies are reported as mean  SD or
mean  SEM. The SEM/SD was calculated on the basis of the
number of independent experiments. Differences were analyzed
by the Student t test. P < 0.05 were regarded as signiﬁcant.

Results
Pim-1,-3 upregulation is associated with acquired resistance to
MET inhibitors
Both EBC-1, a lung cancer cell line, and MKN45, a gastric cancer
cell line, carry MET gene ampliﬁcation and are highly dependent
on MET signaling pathway for growth (26, 27). The long-term
treatment of EBC-1 or MKN45 with the small-molecule MET
inhibitor PHA665752 led to the killing of the majority of these
tumor cells but also to the outgrowth of resistant colonies (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although small-molecule Pim
kinase inhibitor, AZD1208, had little effect on the growth of
these tumor cells, the addition of this inhibitor to PHA665752
suppressed the outgrowth of resistant colonies induced by this
MET inhibitor. Similar results were obtained if levels of Pim-1 and
Pim-3 were reduced with siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S1B and
S1C), suggesting the possibility that Pim kinases contribute to the
emergence of resistance to MET inhibitors.
To investigate mechanism(s) of resistance to MET inhibitors,
both cell lines were treated with two selective MET inhibitors
PHA665752, AZD6094, and a nonselective MET inhibitor
LY2801653 for 24 hours. Short-term inhibition of MET signaling
blocked the phosphorylation of MET as well as the downstream
AKT and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Treatment of these cell lines with MET inhibitors
induced the overexpression of both Pim-1 and Pim-3 but not
Pim-2 (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2A). MET inhibitor
treatment induced the phosphorylation of Bad(112) and eIF4B
(406; Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2A), two known substrates
of the Pim kinases. Similarly, knockdown of endogenous MET
expression with siRNAs in EBC-1, MKN45, and two other cancer
cell lines SNU5 (gastric) and H1993 (lung) both of which also
harbor MET ampliﬁcation led to both increased expression of
Pim-1 and Pim-3 but not Pim-2, and increased levels of the Pim
substrates Bad(112) and eIF4B(406; Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Inhibition of MET signaling using a neutralizing antibody against MET led to similar results (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Thus, inhibition of MET signaling leads to an increase in two Pim
family members. Real-time PCR experiments demonstrated that
the levels of Pim kinase mRNA were not altered by treatment with
MET inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) or MET siRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D), suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism is responsible for the increases in Pim
kinases protein levels.

Overexpression of Pim-1 and Pim-3 is associated with acquired resistance to MET inhibitors. A, crystal violet staining of EBC-1 cells treated with DMSO or
AZD1208 (1 mmol/L) for 4 days, and PHA665752 (PHA, 0.1 mmol/L), or the combination of PHA and AZD1208 for 4 weeks. Representative results are shown. Colonies
were quantiﬁed (mean  SD) from three independent experiments, each group in two replicates. B, expression of indicated proteins was assessed by immunoblot in
EBC-1 cells treated with MET inhibitors PHA665752, AZD6094, or LY2801653 for 24 hours. C, expression of indicated proteins was assessed by immunoblot
in MKN45 or EBC-1 cells treated with a nontargeting control siRNA (siC) or a pool of siRNAs targeting MET (siMET) for 48 hours. D, cell viability of parental EBC-1 or its
resistant subline EBC-1PHAR or EBC-1AZDR was determined by the XTT assay. Results shown are the mean  SEM from three independent experiments,
each point in four replicates. E, expression of indicated proteins was assessed by immunoblot in EBC-1 and its resistant subline EBC-1 PHAR treated with PHA665752
(PHA, 0.1 mmol/L) or geﬁtinib (Gef; 0.1 mmol/L) for 5 hours. F, expression of indicated proteins was assessed by immunoblot in EBC-1 cells treated with
PHA665752 (PHA; 0.1 mmol/L) or AZD6094 (AZD; 0.1 mmol/L) for 5 hours and EBC-1 cells resistant to PHA or AZD at 0.3, 0.5, or 1 mmol/L. G, xenograft tumors were
established in NU/NU nude male mice by subcutaneous injection. Mice were treated with vehicle or AZD6094 (25 mg/kg/d) by oral gavage (n ¼ 5 per group).
Error bars represent mean  SEM. H, expression of indicated proteins was assessed by immunoblot in xenograft tumors in G.

To examine whether Pim protein kinase levels were also
increased in MET inhibitor resistant clones, EBC-1 and MKN45
cells were grown in increasing concentrations of PHA665752 or
AZD6094, similarly to previously described methods (14, 15).
Cells were then expanded in these MET inhibitors (1 mmol/
L; Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2D), and designated PHAR
and AZDR for resistance (R) to PHA665752 and AZD6094,
respectively. Unlike parental cells, the addition of MET inhibitors to these cells did not inhibit growth (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Fig. S2D) nor decrease the downstream phosphorylation of AKT and ERK (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig.
S2E). These resistant cells contain elevated levels of Pim-1 and
Pim-3, but not Pim-2 protein (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

S2F). In contrast, the mRNA levels of Pim kinases remain
unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F). Resistant cells
are also demonstrated to express higher levels of Bcl-2 protein
(Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2F).
To determine in animal models whether Pim protein kinase
levels are increased in MET resistant tumors, cohorts of 10 mice
with established EBC-1–derived tumors were randomly divided
into two groups and treated with the vehicle or the MET
inhibitor AZD6094 (25 mg/kg/d) to derive AZD6094-resistant
tumors. AZD6094 treatment of EBC-1–derived xenograft
tumors resulted in an initial decrease in tumor volume and
then a subsequent increase after 4 weeks, consistent with the
development of acquired resistance (>25% regrowth from

maximal reduction; Fig. 1G). Western blot analysis of these
tumors showed that treatment with this inhibitor blocked the
phosphorylation of MET, but had no effect on the levels of AKT
phosphorylation (Fig. 1H). Importantly, the protein levels of
Pim-1 and Pim-3, but not Pim-2, and the levels of eIF4B
phosphorylation at S406, are upregulated in drug resistant
tumors (Fig. 1H).
Bcl-2 is an effector of Pim in mediating resistance to MET
inhibitors
To investigate whether increased expression of Pim-1 and
Pim-3 may dampen the biologic activity of MET inhibitors,
pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of Pim-1 and Pim-3 was
carried out. As measured by the cleavage of PARP (a marker of
apoptosis; Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4A) and the
double staining of phycoerythrin (PE) Annexin V and 7-AAD
(Supplementary Fig. S4B), PHA665752 treatment induced
apoptosis and decreased the cell viability in EBC-1 and MKN45
cells (Fig. 2B). The Pim inhibitor AZD1208 was only minimally active, while the combination of a Pim and MET
inhibitor synergistically demonstrated, as measured by the
combination index analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4C–S4F;
ref. 28) increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S4A), increased cell death (Supplementary Fig. S4B), and
decreased cell viability (Fig. 2B). Increased PARP cleavage was
also seen in two other cancer cell lines SNU5 and H1993
(Supplementary Fig. S4G), as well as in EBC-1 and MKN45
cells treated with AZD6094 and LGB321, another pan-Pim
kinase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S4H). In contrast, the
viability of Calu1, a lung cancer cell line that is not dependent
on the MET signaling (27) was not signiﬁcantly affected by
PHA665752 (Fig. 2B) nor did the addition of AZD1208 produce a combination effect (Fig. 2B).
The mechanism by which MET inhibitors induce apoptosis
is currently unknown. When pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of MET was applied to MET-driven cells strong downregulation of the antiapoptotic BH3 protein Mcl-1 and induction of proapoptotic Bim were seen (Fig. 2A and C and
Supplementary Fig. S4A). Interestingly, we also observed
increased levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A
and C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). The addition of Pim
inhibitor AZD1208 or siRNAs targeting Pim-1,-3 blocked the
increased expression of Bcl-2 induced by PHA665752 (Fig. 2A
and C and Supplementary Fig. S4A), suggesting a mechanism
to explain the synergistic activity of these inhibitors. To determine whether overexpression of Bcl-2 counteracts the apoptosis induction by PHA665752, EBC-1 or MKN45 cells were
treated with the MET inhibitor with or without Bcl-2 inhibitors, ABT199 or ABT737. Treatment with Bcl-2 inhibitors
markedly enhanced the MET inhibitor apoptosis induction
(Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S5A) and cell viability reduction (Fig. 2E), pointing to the importance of this protein in
MET resistance. The knockdown of Bcl-2 expression with
siRNAs mimicked the phenotype observed with Bcl-2 inhibitors (Fig. 2F and G). Because Bad is a well-known substrate of
Pim kinases and controls, in part, Pim-mediated apoptosis
(21), the role of Bad was evaluated. Treatment with Bad
siRNAs markedly enhanced the MET inhibitor apoptosis
induction (Fig. 2F) and cell viability reduction (Fig. 2G),
suggesting that Bad could be mediating, in part, the Pim effect.
To investigate whether Pim kinases may mediate the resistance

5322 Cancer Res; 75(24) December 15, 2015

to MET inhibitors through controlling the translation of Bcl-2
protein, we ﬁrst performed real-time PCR analysis. Results
showed that PHA665752 did not alter the levels of Bcl-2
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S5B), implicating a posttranscriptional mechanism. It is well established that the protein
translation of Bcl-2 during cellular stress is controlled by its
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 50 -untranslated region (25). To determine whether PHA665752 may
enhance the IRES activity of Bcl-2, we transfected a bicistronic
luciferase construct in which the translation of ﬁreﬂy luciferase
is controlled by Bcl-2 IRES (25) into EBC-1 or MKN45 cells. We
found that PHA665752 increased the ratio of ﬁreﬂy/Renilla
luciferase activities (Fig. 2H). Importantly, both AZD1208 and
LGB321 blocked this increase (Fig. 2H), suggesting overexpression of Pim kinases results in increased translation of Bcl-2 in
response to MET inhibition. On the basis of these data and our
ﬁndings that MET inhibitor–resistant cells express increased
levels of Bcl-2 (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2F), we tested
the ability of the combination of Pim and Bcl-2 inhibitors to
block the growth of MET inhibitor–resistant cancer cells.
Although neither agent alone could achieve those effects, the
combination of AZD1208 nor a Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT199 or
ABT737, signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability of MET-resistant
cells (Fig. 2I and Supplementary Fig. S5C) and induced PARP
cleavage (Fig. 2J and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Taken together,
the data suggest that Pim kinases mediate resistance to MET
inhibitors through controlling cap-independent translation of
Bcl-2.
The upregulation of Pim protein kinases is necessary and
sufﬁcient to mediate resistance to MET inhibitors
To investigate the potential role of Pim-1 and Pim-3 in the
development of resistance to MET inhibitors, we used genetic
and pharmacologic inhibition. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
Pim-1 and Pim-3 in the EBC-1PHAR and MKN45PHAR cells
was found to restore sensitivity of these cells to PHA665752
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). In addition, two structurally dissimilar Pim inhibitors, AZD1208 or LGB321, also
restored sensitivity to concurrent PHA665752 treatment in
each resistant line (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S6C).
PHA665752 treatment decreased the levels of MET phosphorylation in both control and Pim-1, Pim-3 siRNAs, or Pim
inhibitor–treated resistant cells. This drug only decreased the
levels of AKT and ERK phosphorylation and increased the
levels of cleaved PARP in the context of Pim-1 and Pim-3
knockdown (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S6B) or the
treatment with Pim inhibitors (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S6D).
Finally, to determine whether Pim inhibitors could restore MET
inhibitor sensitivity in vivo, xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice using AZD6094-resistant EBC-1AZDR cells expressing
increased levels of Pim-1 and Pim-3 (Fig. 1F). Pim inhibitor
AZD1208 treatment of these animals with resistant tumor cells
restored sensitivity to MET inhibitor AZD6094 (Fig. 3E). Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that AZD6094 inhibited the phosphorylation of MET, while AZD1208 suppressed the phosphorylation of eIF4B and Bad as well as the expression of Bcl-2 (Fig.
3F). Importantly, the combination of AZD6094 and AZD1208
induced the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3F). These data show that
inhibition of Pim kinases is necessary to overcome the resistance
of these cells to MET inhibitor.

those found in resistant cells (Fig. 3G). The activation of Pim-1

a Pim-1 substrate eIF4B (Fig. 3G; ref. 19). The eIF4B phosphorylation on S406 was blocked by the addition of the Pim inhibitor
LGB321 (Fig. 3G). The increase in Pim-1 levels induced resistance
to PHA665752 in EBC-1 cells and this resistance was reversed
upon treatment with LGB321 (Fig. 3H). These data indicate that
the Pim kinase activity is sufﬁcient to promote resistance to MET
inhibitors in these cellular models.
MET-resistant cells display an increased rate of protein
synthesis that is dependent on Pim expression
To explore the biochemical basis for acquired resistance to MET
inhibitors, the de novo protein synthesis rate was measured in
parental and resistant cells. 35S-methionine labeling of newly
synthesized protein was signiﬁcantly increased in resistant cells
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). SDS-PAGE analysis of cell
lysates indicates a bulk increase in many proteins across a large
range of molecular weights (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S7B).
Protein synthesis was inhibited by PHA665752 in parental but
not in resistant cells (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary Fig. S7A
and B). However, treatment with the LGB321, a Pim inhibitor, or
BEZ235, a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, was able to inhibit the protein
synthesis in MET inhibitor–resistant cell lines (Fig. 4A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). These data suggest that increased
expression of the Pim kinases in resistant cells contributes to
continued protein synthesis. In contrast, as measured by labeling
newly transcribed RNA with the uridine analogue 5-ethynyluridine (EU) using click chemistry (29), global RNA synthesis in
resistant cells did not change (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary
Fig. S7C).
Cap-independent translation is increased in resistant cells in a
Pim-dependent fashion
Previously we have suggested that Pim-1 regulates cap-independent translation by stimulating IRES mediated translation
(23). In this study, Pim kinases regulated the activity of Bcl-2
IRES in response to treatment with MET inhibitor (Fig. 2H). To
test whether cap-independent translation is increased in resistant
cells due to upregulation of Pim-1 and Pim-3, two bicistronic
luciferase reporters in which the ﬁrst uses HCV IRES and the
second uses Bcl-2 IRES to control cap-independent translation
with a ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity readout. The ratio of ﬁreﬂy and
Renilla luciferase activities represents cap-independent translation
activity (25, 30). In comparison with parental cell lines, signiﬁcantly increased cap-independent translation was seen in resistant
cells. This activity could be suppressed by the Pim inhibitor
LGB321 but not BEZ235 or PP242 that blocks PI3K/mTOR

activity (Fig. 4E and F and Supplementary Fig. S7D). To conﬁrm
the role of Pim kinases in cap-independent translation, a third
bicistronic reporter composed of a FLAG readout to monitor capdependent translation followed by an IRES site with a c-Myc
readout to monitor cap-independent translation from the same
transcript was used (31). LGB321, but not BEZ235, reduced capindependent translation in resistant EBC-1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7E and S7F), while reporter RNA levels are not affected
(Supplementary Fig. S7G). Furthermore, treatment of resistant
cells with siRNAs targeting Pim-1 and Pim-3 reduced the activities
of HCV and Bcl-2 IRES (Supplementary Fig. S7H). Thus, in
resistant cell lines, increased expression of Pim stimulates capindependent transcription. To determine whether Pim kinases
regulate cap-dependent translation, an m7GTP cap binding assay
was performed. In both parental and resistant cells, treatment of
BEZ235, but not AZD1208, resulted in reduced levels of 4E-BP1
phosphorylation, and consequently increased binding of 4E-BP1
as well as reduced binding of eIF4G to m7GTP cap (Fig. 4G and
Supplementary Fig. S7I). The data suggest PI3K–AKT–mTOR, but
not Pim, signaling pathway controls cap-dependent translation in
these cells.

Discussion
Overexpression of Pim kinases has been observed in a variety of
human cancers, including hematologic cancers, prostate cancer,
pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, colon
cancer, and liver cancer (18). Dysregulated expression of Pim
kinases has been strongly implicated in tumorigenesis through
cooperation with MYC, mediating survival signaling, and regulation of cell-cycle progression (18). Treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents in several different experimental settings and
small-molecule AKT inhibitors can induce the overexpression of
Pim in prostate cancer cells and this elevation in Pim kinases
promotes drug resistance (20, 23, 32, 33).
Here, we have identiﬁed a novel resistance mechanism by
which feedback induction of Pim-1 and Pim-3 in response to
inhibition of the MET signaling in MET-"addicted" cancer cells
signiﬁcantly contributes to resistance to drug treatment and
consequently limits the efﬁcacy of such agents. The levels of
Pim kinases show a progressive increase while the MET-dependent cells adapt to increasing doses of small-molecule MET
inhibitors (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2F), suggesting an
important role of Pim kinases in the development of acquired
resistance. Indeed, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Pim
kinases resensitized resistant cells to MET inhibitors (Fig. 3 and

Figure 3.
Pim upregulation is necessary and sufﬁcient to confer resistance to MET inhibitors in MET-dependent cellular models. A, cell viability was determined by the XTT

Pim Kinases Mediate Resistance to MET Inhibitors

Supplementary Fig. S6). To validate this observation, it will be
important to investigate the clinical relevance of Pim upregulation
by examining biopsies from patients treated with MET inhibitors.
An unidentiﬁed posttranscriptional mechanism is responsible for
the increases in Pim kinases protein levels in response to MET
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3). Previous studies have shown
that Pim-1 can be translated when cap-dependent translation is
compromised (34, 35). Further studies are needed to determine
whether Pim kinases are regulated at translational level in this
setting.
Why does this feedback mechanism of Pim kinases upregulation not fully protect cancer cells from MET inhibitor treatment?
The relatively slow kinetics associated with Pim kinase feedback
upregulation and the relatively rapid suppression of oncogenic
survival signals downstream of MET suggest a model in which the
rates of engagement of the apoptotic machinery and the cellprotective feedback signaling pathways determine the fate of cells
following treatment with MET inhibitors.
Mechanistic studies showed that Pim kinases upregulate the
cap-independent translation of Bcl-2 to counteract the effect of
apoptosis induction by MET inhibitors (Fig. 2A, D, F, and H and
Supplementary Fig. S5A). This is consistent with the notion put
forward by Muranen and colleagues (36) that cancer cells activate
cap-independent translation under the stress of PI3K/mTOR
inhibition. We have previously shown that in the context of AKT
inhibition, the expression of a number of RTKs is controlled by
Pim-1 in a cap-independent manner (23). MET inhibitors strongly suppress the downstream PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling in METdependent cancer cells (Fig. 1B, C, and E; refs. 11, 15, 27). It is not
surprising that a cap-independent translation program is activated
following exposure to MET inhibitors. Indeed, resistant cells
display Pim-dependent increased cap-independent translation
and total protein synthesis (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S7).
Studies in our laboratory are under way to identify translational
targets of Pim kinases and determine how Pim kinases may
control protein translation. It is of importance and interest to
further characterize this cap-independent translation program.
Such studies may identify additional points for therapeutic intervention in the context of the acquisition of resistance to MET
inhibitors in MET-dependent cancers. The induction of Pim-1 and
Pim-3 in response to treatment with MET inhibitors appears to be
controlled by a posttranscriptional mechanism (data not shown).
Further work will be necessary to fully elucidate this mechanism.
Tumor heterogeneity plays a crucial role in tumor progression
and resistance to therapy (37). High-level ampliﬁcation of RTKs,
including MET, appears to be a relatively late event in the tumorigenesis of glioblastoma (38). Ampliﬁcation of MET as a progression but not a tumor-initiating driver is often heterogeneous
among cells within a single tumor (39), suggesting the possibility
of multiple mechanisms of MET inhibitor resistance in a single
heterogeneous tumor. Indeed, previous studies by others have
identiﬁed several potential mechanisms of resistance to MET
inhibitors (12–15). Our data identifying Pim kinase as a mediator
of the mechanism of resistance to MET inhibitors enhance the

understanding of tumor heterogeneity and the molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of resistance to molecularly targeted
therapy. It remains unknown whether upregulation of Pim
kinases coexists with these resistance mechanisms. Further work
will be needed to determine the cooperative role Pim activation
plays with other genetic and genomic alterations to induce resistance to MET inhibitors in lung, gastric, and other cancers.
Although promising results have been reported in lung, gastric,
prostate, and papillary renal cancer patients treated with MET
inhibitors, less than predicted efﬁcacy was seen in several completed clinical trials (7, 40). The main challenges facing the
effective use of Met-targeted antagonists for cancer treatment are
optimal patient selection, diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarker development, and the identiﬁcation and testing of optimal therapy combinations (7). Our data show that the kinase
activity of Pim is required for MET inhibitors resistance in METdependent tumor models. This observation provides a strong
rationale for the development and testing of cotreatment of MET
and Pim kinase inhibitors for clinical use in MET-addicted cancers
to either prevent or overcome the acquisition of resistance to MET
inhibitors. On the basis of our data, we propose that inhibition of
Pim signaling may enhance responses to treatment with MET
inhibitors in appropriately selected patients with MET-addicted
cancers.
