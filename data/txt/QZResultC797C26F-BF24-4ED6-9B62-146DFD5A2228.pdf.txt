ABSTRACT
Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring sensitive
epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations invariably develop acquired
resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Identification of actionable
genetic alterations conferring drug-resistance can be helpful for guiding the
subsequent treatment decision. One of the major resistant mechanisms is secondary
EGFR-T790M mutation. Other mechanisms, such as HER2 and MET amplifications, and
PIK3CA mutations, were also reported. However, the mechanisms in the remaining
patients are still unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling in a
cohort of 83 NSCLC patients with TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations at diagnosis and
acquired resistance to three different first-generation EGFR TKIs using targeted next
generation sequencing (NGS) of 416 cancer-related genes. In total, we identified 322
genetic alterations with a median of 3 mutations per patient. 61% of patients still
exhibit TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations, and 36% of patients acquired EGFR-T790M.
Besides other known resistance mechanisms, we identified TET2 mutations in 12% of
patients. Interestingly, we also observed SOX2 amplification in EGFR-T790M negative
patients, which are restricted to Icotinib treatment resistance, a drug widely used in
Chinese NSCLC patients. Our study uncovered mutational profiles of NSCLC patients
with first-generation EGFR TKIs resistance with potential therapeutic implications.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene
mutations are found in ~10% of lung adenocarcinomas
in Caucasian population [3], but in 30% ~ 50% of Asian
population [7, 8], which define a substantial population
that can benefit from the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs). Several randomized phase III clinical
trials have shown the superiority in the overall response
rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (PFS)
of EGFR TKI treatment over chemotherapy as first-line
therapy for patients with TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in
China as well as worldwide [1]. Approximately 80% of
lung cancers are non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC),
and the overall 5-year relative survival rate for this cohort
is less than 20% [2]. Patients with advanced NSCLC have
an extremely high mortality rate. During the past decades,
genomic research has increased our understanding of the
molecular characterization of cancer [3-5]. The treatment
strategy for advanced NSCLC has changed dramatically
from the traditional chemotherapy depending on

[9, 10]. However, the vast majority of patients inevitably
experienced acquired resistance in less than one year,
limiting the overall survival advantage of EGFR TKI
treatment over chemotherapy [11, 12].
Currently, the known mechanisms of acquired
resistance are as follows [13-17]: 1) the secondary
gatekeeper EGFR T790M mutation which increases ATP
affinity and subsequently prevents drug binding to the
kinase domain; 2) activation of members of downstream
signaling pathways such as RAS-RAF-ERK MAPK
pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; 3) activation
of bypass signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase such
as MET; 4) changes in tumor histology with tumor cells
displaying features of small-cell lung cancer or epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). The above mechanisms
account for about 70% of acquired resistance, with 30%
of remaining patients demonstrating unknown resistant
mechanisms.
The introduction of next generation sequencing
(NGS) into cancer genetic interrogation achieved
tremendous successes in acquiring cancer genomic
information comprehensively and efficiently [18]. It
demonstrates great potentials in identifying genetic
aberrations that can be used to match targeted drugs and
monitoring acquired genetic changes during the treatment
with limit amount of tumor materials. To take advantage of
this technology, we performed targeted NGS with a gene
panel covering 416 cancer-related genes to profile genetic
characteristics of 83 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients after they developed systematically progress to the
first generation EGFR TKI treatments, including erlotinib,
gefitinib and icotinib. Besides EGFR T790M mutations,
a variety of other previously known and novel genetic
alterations were identified that might be potentially related
to their primary and acquired resistance to treatments.

68 patients (81.9%) were adenocarcinoma and 4 (4.8%)
were squamous cell carcinoma. The rest 11 patients cannot
be clearly distinguished based on histology appearance..
Half of patients were subjected to icotinib treatment upon
diagnosis largely because of its lower cost compared to the
other two options [19].
A total of 322 cancer-related genetic mutations were
detected in these patients with a median of 3 mutations
per patient and a range of 1-10 mutations per patient
(Figure 1A). 87 genes within the 416-gene panel were
involved. Majority of mutations (47%) were missense
mutations and other types of mutations were also
uncovered (Figure 1B).

EGFR mutational status in all patients
30 of 83 patients (36.1%) were detected with
EGFR T790M mutation and all of them except one were
found harboring EGFR activating mutation either exon
19 deletion (19del) or L858R (Figure 2). 6 of them were
accompanied with the copy number gain of EGFR and
one of them harbors C797S mutation, which will exert
resistance to the third generation EGFR TKI, AZD9291
[20]. Uncommon mutations including S752F and N826S
were also identified in one case each, which might be
related to the resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib according
to previous reports [21, 22].
As to the other EGFR-T790M negative (T790M-)
patients, in addition to the presence of 19del (23%)
and L858R (17%), a variety of other infrequent
EGFR mutations that were suggested less sensitive
to the first generation TKIs were identified, including
M766delinsMASV, D770delinsDNPH, L861Q and G719A
[23, 24], as well as R776C mutation that was previously
reported to be more sensitive to erlotinib than gefitinib
[21]. One patient carries doublet mutations E709K/
G719A, which were reported as oncogenic drivers but
maintaining the same responses to the first generation
TKIs [25, 26]. 27 patients were not identified with any
EGFR mutations. Statistical analysis indicates that the
presence of T790M did not show clear association with
gender or targeted drugs adminstrated (Table 2).

RESULTS
An overall characterization of cancer-related
mutations identified in all patients
We analyzed either genomic DNAs from formalinfixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples or pleural
effusions, or circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNA) from
plasma samples from 83 Chinese NSCLC patients with
stage IV diseases at the time of developing drug resistance
to the first generation of EGFR TKIs, erlotinib, gefitinib
or icotinib. These patients were identified with TKIsensitizing EGFR mutations prior to treatments and
their characteristics were summarized in Table 1. The
choice of collecting different tumor materials depends
on clinical risks that would impose on the patients by the
operation. 45 patients (54.2%) patients were undertaken
blood withdrawing for testing ctDNA, while in others
tumor tissues or pleural effusions were obtained through
biopsies. Prior-treatment histology analysis confirmed that

Top mutated genes in T790M- patients
In T790M absent group, other genetic mutations
are potentially responsible for drug resistance. To clarify
this, we generated a co-mutation plot by dividing the
patients into two groups according to their T790M
statuses for 11 most frequently mutated genes in
T790M- patients. T790M positive (T790M+) group
showed limit number of mutations in these genes other
than EGFR and TP53 mutations compared to T790Mgroup, indicating that T790M alone is the dominant
resistant mechanism in this group (Figure 3). In T790Mgroup, EGFR (26 out of 53 patients, 49%) and TP53

“%” indicates the percentage of each specific mutation detected in the population of defined category. The statistical
differences of mutation frequency in different groups were tested by Fisher’s exact test.
It is noticeable that MET amplification only
occurred in gefitinib treated group and statistical analysis
found a significantly difference of its occurrence in three
treatment groups (p < 0.05) (Table 2). Meanwhile, SOX2
amplification specifically presented in icotinib group and
more frequently in male, but is not statistically different
probably due to the small sample size (Table 2). The
occurrence of KRAS activating point mutations is reported
being mutually exclusive to EGFR mutations in treatment
naïve patients possible due to their overlapping pathways
in the onset of cancer [27, 28]. However, we observed
one case that carries not only KRAS G13C and V14I,
but also EGFR 19del, T751P and amplification (Figure
3A, Supplementary Table S1). It is also showed that the
rearrangement of ALK only happens in cases without
EGFR mutations, indicating its possible role in EGFR
TKIs resistance.

We next determined the association of most
commonly mutated genes with ages of patients at the
time of NGS testing. Patients with TP53, TET2 and SOX2
mutations are all significantly older than those without
mutations on these genes (Supplementary Figure S1). In
contrast, the presence of EGFR T790M is not correlated
with ages.

DISCUSSION
This study profiled genetic backgrounds of 83 patients
with advanced NSCLC using a targeted pan-cancer NGS
panel after they developed resistance to three different first
generation EGFR TKIs. To our knowledge, it is one of the
largest panels in the clinical practice that covers most up-todate cancer-related genes. Similar to previous reports, we
identified EGFR T790M as the most abundant secondary

mutation in developing drug resistance to the treatment of
erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib, and it is observed irrespective
of sex, age and treatment options. The study depicts other
diverse mechanisms that potentially are responsible for EGFR
TKI resistance. The most frequent mechanisms in addition to
EGFR T790M are the activation of other RTKs, including
ERBB2, MET, FGFR1 and ALK (totally 29% in T790Mwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients), RAS/MEK/ERK pathway (totally 17%), as well
as PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway (totally 20%). RTKs are
currently the most druggable targets. The representative drugs
in market or in clinical trials are osimertinib (AZD9291)
for EGFR T790M mutation [29], afatinib for ERBB2
amplification, crizotinib for ALK gene fusions and MET
amplification, and AZD4547 for FGFR1 mutations.

Due to the lack of comprehensive genetic
information before treatment, it is hard to conclude newly
acquired resistant mechanisms solely from post-treatment
results. But a few putative candidates that correlate to
the resistance of the first generation EGFR TKI come
to surface by comparing the genetic spectrums between
EGFR T790M+ and T790- groups. EGFR T790M+ group
did not encompass any mutations on genes KRAS, MET,
ALK and FGFR1 (Figure 3A), while all these genes have
been suggested resulting in poor responses to EGFR TKIs
in NSCLC patients [30-32]. Because both MET and EGFR
reside on chromosome 7, a previous study suggested that
polysomy of entire chromosome would result in the in cis
amplification of MET and EGFR genes and it is hard to
distinguish them by FISH [33]. Here in our study, 3 out
of 4 cases with MET amplification were not escorted with
EGFR amplification, and 1 case shows significantly higher
amplification of MET compared to EGFR. Therefore,
MET is more likely acting as a bypass signaling pathway
that exerts resistance to EGFR TKIs. Moreover, it shows
statistically higher occurrence in gefitinib-treated group
rather than erlotinib and icotinib groups. Further studies
with larger sample sizes might be needed in order to
elucidate this finding.
Icotinib is the second line first generation EGFR TKI
that was approved by China Food and Drug Administration
(CFDA) in 2011, and because of its compatible efficacy
and side effects as gefitinib [34], as well as its lower price,
it is widely used in treating NSCLC in China. As far as
we know, our study was the first to examine the genetic
spectrums of icotinib-resistant NSCLC patients compared
to other first generation EGFR TKIs, and found that SOX2
amplification were private to icotinib treatment resistance.
SOX2 is frequently amplified at a percentage of around
20% in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and NSCLC [35,
36]. It functions as a transcription factor that inhibits
cell differentiation [37] and promotes cell cycling [38].
In addition, it is recognized as a downstream molecule
of AKT/mTOR pathway that exerts controlling over cell
survival [39].
There are several limitations in this study: firstly,
since this was a retrospective analysis and most of
patients were outpatients, we were unable to collect all the
patients’ subsequent treatment strategies and outcomes;
Secondly, since there was no comparison with the pretreatment genetic background, it was not certain whether
these alterations have emerged as a result of acquired
resistance, or they have been there since the beginning of
the treatment; Thirdly, the relatively limited sample size of
this study could decrease the statistical power in analysis.
Thus, we are ready to conduct a prospective research
using NGS technology to compare the pre-treatment and
acquired resistance genetic profiles to further uncover the
mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
In summary, the study depicted the genetic
landscapes comprehensively in Chinese NSCLC

population resistant to first generation TKI treatments
including icotinib. Our analysis demonstrates new
perspectives for further study of resistance and putting
forward corresponding relevant tactics against the
challenge of disease progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient enrollment and sample preparation
Between Jan 2015 to Dec 2015, a total of 83
patients with stage IV NSCLC in Zhejiang Cancer
Hospital, China, were undergoing tumor biopsies or blood
withdrawing by the time of acquiring resistance to the
first generation EGFR TKIs, including 26 formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, 45 serum samples
and 12 serous effusions. Acquired resistance to EGFR
TKIs was evaluated by “Jackman criteria” in each patient
[40]. For FFPE samples, only samples harbored tumor
cell content above 20% were considered qualified and
included. Written consents from all patients were collected
according to the ethic regulations of Zhejiang Cancer
Hospital. Collected samples were sent to the core facility
of Nanjing Shihe Jiyin Biotechnology Inc. (Nanjing,
China) for targeted NGS analysis.

DNA extraction
5-8 of 10μm tissue sections from tumor FFPE
samples were used for genomic DNA extraction with
QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma was extracted
from 5-10 ml peripheral blood in EDTA-coated tubes
within 2 hours of blood withdrawing, and circulating
cell free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted using the QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (QIAGEN). Genomic DNA
of cellular sediments of pleural effusions and whole
blood samples were prepared with DNeasy Blood &
Tissue kit (QIAGEN). Whole blood DNA was sequenced
together with tumor or ctDNA samples for the purpose
of identifying germline mutations. The DNA quality was
assessed by Nanodrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
the quantity was measured by dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life
Technologies) on Qubit 2.0.

Library preparation and sequencing
Extracted tumor genomic DNA was fragmented
into 300~350bp using Covaris M220 instrument
(Covaris). Sequencing libraries were prepared with
KAPA Hyper Prep kit (KAPA Biosystems) with
optimized protocols. In brief, cfDNA or sheared tissue
DNA were experienced with end-repairing, A-tailing,
adapter ligation and size selection using Agencourt
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Libraries were
then subjected to PCR amplification and purification
before targeted enrichment.

Annotation and interpretation of sequencing
results
Trimmomatic [41] was used for sequencing data
quality control. The reads with a quality below the threshold
of 15, as well as N bases were removed before mapping
to reference sequence hg19 (Human Genome version 19)
using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [42] with optimized
parameters. Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [43] was
used for indels local realignment and base quality score
recalibration. SNPs/indels were identified using VarScan2
(MAF<10%) (http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/) and
HaplotypeCaller/UnifiedGenotyper in GATK (MAF>10%).
SNPs were filtered out with dbSNP and 1000 Genome data
sets. Germline mutations in tumor tissues or ctDNA were
identified by comparing to the matched whole blood DNA.
A mutation was called when at least 3 mutated reads were
found in the sample on different strands with good quality
scores and manually inspected in Integrative Genomics
Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute). Genomic fusions were
identified by FACTERA [44] with default parameters. Copy
number variations (CNVs) were detected using ADTEx
(http://adtex.sourceforge.net) with default parameters.
Proposed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to
reduce intrinsic noise.
