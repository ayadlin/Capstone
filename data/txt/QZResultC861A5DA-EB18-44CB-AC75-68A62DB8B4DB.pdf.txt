ABSTRACT
Studies have investigated biguanide-derived agents for the treatment of cancers
and have reported their effects against tumorspheres (TSs). The purpose of this study
was determining the effects of HL156A, a newly designed biguanide with improved
pharmacokinetics, on glioblastoma TSs (GMB TSs) and assess the feasibility of
this drug as a new line of therapy against glioblastoma, alone or combined with a
conventional therapeutic agent, temozolomide(TMZ). The effects of HL156A, alone and
combined with TMZ, on the stemness and invasive properties of GBM TSs and survival
of orthotopic xenograft animals were assessed. HL156A, combined with TMZ, inhibited
the stemness of GBM TSs, proven by neurosphere formation assay and marker
expression. Three-dimensional collagen matrix invasion assays provided evidence
that combined treatment inhibited invasive properties, compared with control and
TMZ-alone treatment groups. TMZ alone and combined treatment repressed the
expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes. A gene ontology
comparison of TMZ and combination-treatment groups revealed altered expression
of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular adhesion and migration. Combined
treatment with HL156A and TMZ showed survival benefits in an orthotopic xenograft
mouse model. The inhibitory effect of combination treatment on the stemness and
invasive properties of GBM TSs suggest the potential usage of this regimen as a novel
strategy for the treatment of GBM.

INTRODUCTION

concept is still limited. Metformin has limitations as an
anticancer drug because its hydrophilic nature prevents
it from entering cells [14]. In addition, metformin only
enters cells through members of the organic cation
transporter (OCT) family, whose expression is dependent
on the genetic background of individuals [14].
HL156A is a derivative of metformin with increased
hydrophobicity developed by HanAll Biopharma in
Korea., but its potency and pharmacokinetic property
were improved [15]. The compounds were evaluated
the potency of inhibiting OXPHOS in mitochondria
and pharmacokinetic property in vivo [15]. The toxicity
of HL156A was assessed and there were no meaningful
toxicities with up to a 120 mg/kg dose [15]. It was reported
that HL156A is protective against peritoneal fibrosis in an
in vitro and in vivo model of peritoneal fibrosis [15].
In the present study, we assessed the effects of the
newly designed biguanide, HL156A, alone and combined
with the conventional chemotherapeutic agent TMZ, on
the tumorsphere properties and survival of orthotopic
xenografted animals. Our results suggest the feasibility of
using HL156A as part of a new therapeutic regimen for
GBM.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive
malignant brain tumor, with patients showing a very
limited survival rate despite the best treatment [1].
According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guidelines on central nervous system cancer,
only a third of GBM patients survive for 1 year and less
than 5% live beyond 5 years [2]. Temozolomide (TMZ),
an alkylating (methylating) agent, is now the standard of
care in conjunction with postoperative radiation therapy
for younger, good-responding patients with GBM [1,
2]. However, the disease is invariably fatal, and patients
ultimately succumb because of disease relapse. A
growing body of evidence supports the idea that cancers
are initiated and maintained by a subpopulation of cells
termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) [3, 4]. The clinical
implication of research on tumor-derived, CSC-enriched
tumorspheres (TSs) is that a curative therapy will require
complete elimination of this unique population, even in
patients with an initial positive response to treatment,
since the disease may ultimately recur if even a small
number of CSCs survive the therapy [5, 6]. Accumulating
evidence has established that CSC populations are more
resistance to conventional cancer therapy than non-CSC
populations [7]. For example, CD133-positive GBM
TSs display a strong capacity to resist chemotherapy
and radiotherapy [8, 9]. Consequently, novel therapeutic
strategies designed to eliminate or inhibit CSCs, including
targeting surface markers or signaling cascades, or altering
the microenvironment in which these cells potentially
reside, have been explored [10].
Studies on the biguanide derivate, metformin
(N’,N’-dimethylbiguanide), the most widely used oral
therapeutic agent for lowering blood glucose concentration
in patients with type 2 diabetes, have revealed that
this agent significantly reduces cancer incidence and
improves cancer patients’ survival. Laboratory evidence
of the antineoplastic effects of biguanide has continued
to accumulate, and results of the first generation of
clinical trials on metformin are anticipated [11, 12]. A
number of mechanisms have been suggested to account
for the direct actions of biguanides on transformed cells
or cells at risk for transformation, including induction
of energetic stress and consequent disruption of cellular
homeostasis, energy depletion caused by inhibition of
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which leads to an
energy-conserved state, and activation of intracellular 5'
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but the precise
mechanism is still under investigation. Remarkably, Hirsch
et al. have demonstrated that mass-forming, self-renewing,
tumor-initiating breast cancer cells exhibit an exaggerated
sensitivity to metformin [13]. This group suggested that
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β–induced epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) might represent a common
molecular mechanism underlying the anti-CSC actions of
metformin [11]. However, supporting evidence for this

RESULTS
GBM TSs characterization
The self-renewal capacity was confirmed in GSC11,
TS15-88, TS13-20, U87 sphere, and X01 sphere igure 1A).
Immunocytochemistry revealed that all four cell tyspes
were positive for CD133 (also known as PROM1), and
GSC11, TS15-88 and U87 spheres were also positive for
nestin. Musashi expression was variable, with only GSC11
and X01 TSs showing partial expression. Podoplanin
(PDPN) expression was observed only in GSC11 TSs
(Figure 1B). Neuroglial cells were identified in all GBMTSs, as evidenced by the expression of glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP), major basic protein (MBP), NeuN and/
or TUBB3 (Figure 1C). GFAP and MBP expression was
not identified in U87 sphere. GFAP and MBP expression
were not detected in sphere-cultured U87 cells. The
molecular characteristics of GBM-TSs, including molecular
subtype based on expression profiles, methylation of the
O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
gene promoter and the presence of IDH mutations, are
summarized in Table 1. An analysis of the gene expression
profile of these GBM-TSs by microarrays and unsupervised
clustering revealed that X01 and U87 spheres showed an
expression profile distinct from that of GSC11 and TS15-88
TSs, as well as TS13-20 TSs (Figure 1D).

1-carboximidamide acetate), a derivative of biguanide
with improved bioavailability, is depicted in Figure 2A.
In contrast to metformin with limited brain-blood barrier
permeability due to the heterogenous expression between
the individuals, HL156A enters the cell independent of
OCT1 and penetrates extensively into the brain. HL156A
is cell membrane permeable and orally available in vivo.
Following oral administration (30 mg/kg) to test mice, the
brain-to-plasma (BP) ratio of HL156 (0.37) was higher
than that of metformin (0.10) and phenformin (0.13),
and its bioavailability was ~72.9%, revealing improved
penetration into the central nervous system (Figure 2B,
Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

(OCR) (Figure 3B, 3C, and 3D). Even at a concentration
that does not affect viability, treatment with HL156A,
TMZ or their combination decreased ATP levels, 18F-FDG
uptake and OCR, suggestive of metabolic perturbations in
cells and energy stress. The decrease was most prominent
in the combination treatment group. At the concentration
examined, TMZ alone and in combination with TMZ
caused a minimal increase in apoptosis, but had no clear
G2/M-blocking effect; this contrasts with a previous report
showing that an AMPK agonist blocks G2/M in cells
(Figure 3E) [16] An examination of GBM-TSs revealed
inconsistent expression of AMPK-mTOR pathway
proteins. AMPK phosphorylation and subsequent mTOR
inhibition in response to the drugs was not observed in
tested GBM-TSs, despite ATP depletion in these cells
(Figure 3F). There was no previously known LKB1 gene
mutation in GSC11 cell line when we analyzed exon
1,2,3,5 and 7, except one deletion on exon 3 which is not
described in other disease.

Selection of HL156A and TMZ concentrations
for experiments
To identify particular drug-induced cellular
phenomena without affecting the viability of cells, we
established a sublethal concentration of each drug. To this
end, we examined cell viability in GBM-TSs (GSC11,
TS15-88 and X01) and sphere-cultured U87 GBM cells
following treatment with HL156A and TMZ, alone
and in combination, using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. HL156A and TMZ at
concentrations of 15 and 500 μM, respectively, which
showed minimal effects on cell viability (>80%) in three
out of the four cell types, were adopted as sublethal
concentrations for subsequent experiments (Figure 3A). The
combination treatment was additive, but not synergistic.

Effects of HL156A, TMZ, and combination
treatment on the stemness of GBM TSs
HL156, TMZ and combination treatment decreased
the stemness of GSC11, TS15-88, U87 and X01 TSs, as
demonstrated by tumorsphere-formation assays (Figure
4A and 4B) and Western blotting for stemness markers,
including nestin, CD133, Sox-2, Oct3/4, Notch 2, and
Twist. The proportion of sphere-positive wells was
markedly decreased by treatment with HL156A or TMZ
alone, and was more prominently decreased by combined
treatment with HL156A and TMZ (Figure 4B). This latter
effect was additive, although there was a trend towards
synergy that fell short of significance. LDH assays
revealed that a majority of sphere cells were viable,
implying that the decrease in sphere formation is not
attributable to cell death (Figure 4C). Combined treatment
with Hl156A and TMZ caused a decrease in Sox2 and
Notch2 expression in GSC11 TSs, and decreased Oct 3/4,
Sox2, Notch 2 expression in TS15-88 and X01 TSs (Figure

AMPK agonist, we assessed the effects of HL156A, TMZ
and their combination on cellular metabolism by assaying
ATP, 18F-FDG uptake and oxygen consumption rate

4D). This effect was not attributable to changes in cellular
viability or cytotoxic effects of drugs, as evidenced by the
fact that LDH assays also revealed no significant cell death
in HL156A, TMZ or combined treatment groups (Figure
4C). Neither HL156A nor TMZ promoted neuro-glial
differentiation, as evidenced by the absence of a change
in the expression of the neuronal markers Olig2, Tuj1,
and GFAP (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, it is unlikely
that the therapeutic effect of these agents is mediated
by differentiation of tumor cells into mature cells—one
proposed mechanism for targeting CSCs.

property of GBM TSs using three dimensional (3D) matrix
platforms and quantified the result by assessing the area of
invasion of GBM TSs. The implanted GBM TS migrated

combination of both drugs suppressed the invasiveness of
GSC11 GBM TSs compared with controls (Supplementary
Videos S1 and S2), an effect that was most prominent
with combination treatment, when assessed quantitatively
(Figure 5A and 5B, implanted cells and drugs together)
This invasion-suppressing action was not attributable to
drug effects on cell viability since cell viability was not
significantly affected under these experimental conditions.
To identify mechanisms underlying of inhibition of
invasion, we assessed expression of the EMT-related
markers, β-catenin, Zeb1 and N-cadherin, and the
mesenchymal-epithelial markers E-cadherin and Zo-1.
These markers showed inconsistent expression among

cell types, with TMZ and combination treatment causing
decreased N-cadherin expression in GSC11 cells, and
decreased Zeb1 and N-cadherin expression in TS15-88 and
X01 cells; the latter observation may provide a mechanism
to account for the results of 3D invasion assays described
above (Figure 5C).

that were differentially expressed following combination
treatment. Among several downregulated genes were those
encoding FBLN7, an adhesion protein that interacts with
extracellular matrix, Lyn, a protein known to regulate
cell migration, and LAMA4, a type of laminin. Using a
BRB-Array tool to perform a Gene Ontology analysis
of genes that were differentially expressed between
TMZ alone and combined treatment with HL156A and
TMZ, we found that the differentially expressed gene set

included genes related to cell adhesion, cell migration, cell
motion, and regulation of cell adhesion (Supplementary
Table 2). Consistent with previous reports that biguanide
blocks mitochondrial complex I, we found that combined
treatment with HL156A and TMZ down-regulated several
genes belonging to mitochondrial complex I. We also
observed that stemness markers (CD133/PROM1, ZEB1
and PDPN) were down-regulated whereas E-cadherin
(CDH2) expression was up-regulated in the combination

animals (P < 0.001, log rank test). The survival benefit
was reproduced at a higher dose of HL156A (45 mg/kg, P
< 0.001; Supplementary Figure 2).

Finally, we analyzed the survival of orthotopic
xenograft mice. Median survival times of controls and
mice treated with HL156A, TMZ and HL156A+TMZ (n=5

Separately, bioluminescence images of mice treated with
drugs were analyzed and quantified (Figure 7A and 7B).
After sacrificing animals, brains were removed, sectioned,
and stained with H&E. Although combination treatment
did not prevent the formation of tumors, it limited the
size and extent of tumor masses (Figure 7C). As shown
in Figure 7C, these in vivo experiments revealed that
combined treatment with HL156A and TMZ exerted a

DISCUSSION
Despite recent progress in our understanding of
GBM, the prognosis for GBM patients remains grim [17].
Even in cases where surgery appears to achieve complete
resection, the tumor tends to recur and ultimately takes
the patient’s life [18–20]. Accordingly, a new therapeutic
strategy would seem to be required. Identifying key

molecules associated with the unique properties of tumor
cells so as to target these cells may be a viable approach,
since numerous studies have reported that tumorspheres
derived from GBM are chemo- and radio-resistant, which
could potentially cause recurrence of the disease.
In the present study, we examined the effects
of treatment with HL156A and TMZ, alone and in
combination, on the stemness and invasive properties of
GBM TSs (GSC11, TS15-88, TS13-20, U87 sphere and
X01). Combined treatment with the new agent HL156A
and the well-known conventional chemotherapeutic agent
TMZ reduced stemness and invasive properties of GBMTSs, an effect that was associated with changes in EMTrelated markers. A similar additive effect of metformin and
conventional therapy has been reported for a breast cancer
stem cell model [21] and glioblastoma model [22, 23].
The authors of former study reported an additive effect

of metformin with the cytotoxic effects of hyperthermia
and showed this was mediated by activation of AMPK and
inactivation of mTOR [21]. Metformin is also known to
kill and radiosensitize cancer cells, and to preferentially
kill breast cancer stem cells, [24] an effect that has
also been observed in GBM [23]. One group reported
metformin plus TMZ-based chemotherapy as an adjuvant
treatment for WHO grade III and IV malignant gliomas,
[25] and another group specifically targeted CSCs of GBM
using metformin plus sorafenib [23, 26]. Among possible
contributors to the superior survival results observed in
the combination group in the present study are 1) the
combined actions of the cytotoxic effect of TMZ on
tumors and the deteriorated cellular energy metabolism
environment induced by HL156A, and 2) the additive
inhibitory effect of TMZ and HL156A on the invasive
properties of TSs, which results in a less aggressive

tumor phenotype. Given the heterogeneity of cancer cells,
targeting GBM CSCs by evoking general metabolic stress
seems a reasonable approach, as it may provide a less
favorable environment for metabolically active tumor cells
[27, 28]. Although the well-known biguanide, metformin,
may have effects similar to those of HL156A, the delivery
of metformin to the brain is limited [29]. HL156A
overcomes this shortcoming and shows generally high
bioavailability. The prominent survival benefit of in vivo
combination treatment may be attributable to the excellent
penetration ability of HL156A. Further studies on this new

compound in combination with conventional therapy in
the treatment of malignant tumors are warranted.
The cellular mechanism underlying the effect of
HL156A on GBM seems distinct in that the expected
AMPK activation and consequent inhibition of the mTOR
pathway was not consistently observed in this study. It
was reported that cellular sensitivity to metformin also
depends on the genetic and mutational backgrounds of the
different GB cells [23]. Thus, different genetic background
of GSC11 TSs and X01 TSs may explain this discrepancy
in the response of those specific pathway. Recently, Liu

Tumor volumes were assessed and quantified. C. Tumors from animals treated with HL156A or HL156A and TMZ showed less irregular
margins than those from controls. Notably, combination treatment decreased tumor volume. Survival of animals in the combination
treatment group was significantly increased (P < 0.0001).

et al. reported that AMPK is activated in glioblastoma,
and the anti-proliferative effect of metformin is AMPK
independent [16]. The present study also confirmed
increased basal AMPK expression in GSC11 and X01
cells, and similarly, found that AMPK activation and
consequent mTOR inhibition apparently underlie the
inhibitory effect of HL156A and the combination of
HL156A and TMZ on GBM TSs. Instead, HL156A,
whether alone or combined with TMZ, compromises
glucose uptake, as evidenced by the reduced uptake of
18
F-FDG following drug treatment; this contrasts with
activation of AMPK, which usually leads to an increase
in glucose uptake [30]. It has been postulated that certain
types of glioma stem cells are maintained by an activated
glycolytic metabolism [31], and glycolytic glioma cells
with active glycogen synthase are further proposed to
be sensitive to inhibitors of gluconeogenesis such as
metformin [27]. It has been suggested that metformin
suppresses gluconeogenesis by inhibiting mitochondrial
glycerophosphate dehydrogenase [32]. Metformin also
impairs glycolysis by inhibiting hexokinase II [33].
Similarly, the effects of HL156A and the combination of
HL156A and TMZ on TSs by can be explained by their
inhibitory effects on intracellular glucose metabolism,
probably through targeting both mitochondrial and
glycolytic pathways. As previous studies revealed
CSCs usually showed less OCR compared with their
differentiated progenitors [34], the loss of stemness by
HL156A, TMZ and combination treatment may affect the
reduction in OCR.
Another unique aspect of the current work is
that the inhibitory effect of HL156A on the invasive
properties of GBM TSs may be related to alterations
of EMT-related markers. Several groups have reported
that EMT-related markers are upregulated in GBM, and
shown that acquisition of mesenchymal traits by cancer
cells undergoing EMT is related to the acquisition of
a stem cell program [35, 36]. At this point, evidence
supporting a role for the EMT pathway in the pathogenesis
of GBM expansion and invasion is not robust. Although
the process of GBM invasion shares certain similarities
with that of immature neuron migration during embryonic
development, little is known about the process, and
direct evidence for a relation between EMT and invasive
properties is still lacking [35]. Nevertheless, several lines
of evidence suggest that similar molecular alterations
occur with GBM pathophysiology; thus, the effects of
inhibiting this pathway need to be studied to identify the
role of this pathway in the invasive properties of this fatal
disease. An inhibitory effect of metformin on the migration
of the U87 glioma cell line has been reported [27]. Similar
experiments targeting the EMT pathway using an RNA
interference (RNAi) strategy (siRNA or shRNA) may help
resolve these unanswered questions.
Even among TMZ-responsive patients, death
ultimately ensues owing to relapse of the disease [1].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Several strategies have been proposed for overcoming
therapeutic limitation of GBMs, but none has yet proved
successful [17–19]. Because of the intrinsic tendency of
the tumor to infiltrate into normal brain tissue, complete
surgical resection would appear to be an unattainable goal
[37]. Thus, appropriate adjuvant therapy for the potential
remaining cancer cells, including CSCs, is crucial to
overcoming the inevitable fate of the disease. Targeting
GBM TSs as a new strategy needs to be extensively
evaluated in this context. A caveat to applying this
concept is the limited information regarding the identity
of GBM-specific stem cells, which makes it a challenge to
sort these cells for experimentation. For example, which
surface markers define CSCs is a matter of controversy
[38]. Furthermore, some properties of GBM can be
explained by the clonal evolution model of the disease,
which provides another axis of tumor heterogeneity
[39]. Heterogeneity defined by the spatial structure of a
tumor is better explained by the clonal evolution model.
A combined model has also been suggested; thus, more
evidence is needed to understand this specific aspect of the
disease. Altering general intracellular energy metabolism
seems to be a reasonable therapeutic strategy since both
models predict that this approach could effectively target
neoplastic cells [28]. Accordingly, the use of the newly
developed agent, HL156A, combined with conventional
TMZ for targeting GBM CSCs, holds promise as a new
line of therapy against the disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In vivo blood brain barrier permeability
ICR mice (Saeronbio, Uiwang, Korea) were used
for pharmacokinetic studies. The blood-brain barrier
permeability of HL156 and the bioavailability of orally
administered drug(30 mg/kg) were assessed by injecting
mice intraperitoneally with HL156A (10 mg/kg) and
evaluating the concentration of drug in the plasma and
brain by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

GBM TS culture
The GBM TS cell line GSC11, TS13-20 and
TS15-88 derived from primary GBM specimens using a
previously described method [4, 40] (GSC11 was provided
by Frederick F. Lang, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, Texas, USA) and the X01 line, derived from a
female glioblastoma patient, were used for experiment
[41]. For spheres culture, all GBM TSs (GSC11, X01
sphere) were cultured in TS complete media composed
of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture
F-12 (DMEM/F-12; Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA)
containing B27 supplements (1×; Invitrogen, San
Diego, CA, USA), 20 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth

factor (bFGF; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 20 ng/ml
of epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma), and 50 U/ml
penicillin/50 mg/ml streptomycin [40, 42, 43].

After producing a single-cell suspension, GBMTSs (GSC11, TS13-20, TS15-88, U87 sphere and X01)
were cultured in 96-well plates in medium consisting
of DMEM/F-12 containing 2% 1× B27 supplements,
20 ng/ml of 0.02% bFGF, 20 ng/ml of 0.02% EGF,
and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic solution (100×; Gibco,
Invitrogen Korea, Seoul, South Korea). The number of
sphere-positive wells was counted, and the proportion
of sphere-positive wells in the treatment group relative
to that in controls was calculated and presented as a
percentage. Cells cultured under different conditions for
3 weeks were observed with an inverted phase-contrast
microscope (I×71 Inverted Microscope; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) to determine TS morphology and size, and imaged
with a digital camera (DP70 Digital Microscope Camera;
Olympus) using DP Controller software (Olympus).

Lentiviral vector transduction and expression
GSC11 cells stably expressing green fluorescent
protein (GFP-GSC11) and lucerferase(GFP-luc) were
generated by growing cells in complete medium and
then applying supernatants containing GFP/luciferaseexpressing lentivirus. Polybrene (Sigma, Dorset, UK)
was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml and
incubated with cells for 18 hours. After infection, the
cells were placed in fresh growth medium and cultured
using standard methods. Stable GFP/luciferase-GSC11
cells were selected by culturing with 1 mg/ml puromycin
(Life Technologies Korea, Seoul, Korea), and isolated
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for use in
further experiments.

Three-dimensional invasion assay

Cell viability assay

GFP-GSC11,
GFP-TS13-20,
GFP-TS15-88,
GFP-U87 sphere and GFP-X01 cells grown as
spheroids were cultured in collagen I matrices using
polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS)-based
microwells
(diameter and depth of microwells: 6 mm × 500 μm).
Microwells were treated with 1% poly(ethyleneimine)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution for 10
minutes followed by 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 30 minutes, and then washed overnight with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) to make PDMS wells adherent to
collagen. Collagen I matrices were prepared from highconcentration rat tail collagen I (BD Bioscience, Le Pont
de Claix, France) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Briefly, the appropriate amounts of 10x PBS, 1N NaOH,
sterile distilled H2O, and collagen I were mixed to create
gels with the desired final concentration. The solution
was mixed well and kept at 4°C before use. GFP-GSC11
spheroids were encapsulated by pipetting 10 μl of collagen
I solution (4 mg/ml) into the microwell, placing a single
GFP-GSC11 spheroid from the culture plate onto collagen
I matrices, and then dropping 10 μl of collagen I solution
(4 mg/ml) onto the GFP-GSC11 spheroid. The platform
was incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. Cell
viability was assessed by staining GFP-GSC11 spheroids
with 8 μM ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen Korea,
Seoul, Korea) for 30 minutes at 37°C before implantation
in collagen matrix. After full gelation, culture medium
which is consisted of DMEM/F-12 containing 2% 1×
B27 supplements, 20 ng/ml of 0.02% bFGF, 20 ng/ml
of 0.02% EGF, and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic solution
(100×; Gibco) was then added. Cell viability was assessed
by staining GFP-GSC11 spheroids with 8 μM ethidium
homodimer-1 (Invitrogen Korea, Seoul, Korea) for 30
minutes at 37°C after implantation in collagen matrix.
Drug effects were assessed by mixing drugs with medium

Effects of HL156A, TMZ, and combined
HL156A and TMZ treatment on cell survival was
determined using MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium, inner salt] assays [44]. Briefly, GBM TS
cells (5 × 103) were seeded in 96-well plates, incubated at
37°C for 24 hours, and then treated with HL156A, TMZ,
or both for 5 days. MTS reagent (20 μl/well) was added
and absorbance was measured at 490 nm after incubating
at 37°C for 4 hours. Each experiment was repeated three
times in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the
percentage of viable cells relative to controls.

Western blotting
An equal amount of total protein from each sample
(20 μg) in Laemmli sample buffer (GeneTex, Irvine, CA,
USA) was heated at 100°C for 5 minutes, then resolved by
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) on 8% gels and electroblotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare life-Sciences).
Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and 5% non-fat dry
milk, and incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies for
AMPK-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathwayrelated proteins, stemness markers and EMT-related
markers, and then probed with peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature.
After repeated washing, membranes were developed using
enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) reagents (Amersham
Life Science, Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Band densities
were measured using TINA imaging software (Raytest,
Straubenhardt, Germany).

to the final desired concentration of each drug. The
dynamic morphology of GFP-GSC11 spheroids was
monitored by obtaining images using an inverted laserscanning confocal microscope (Nikon Ti-E; Tokyo,
Japan). Invasiveness was quantified using the maximal
area covered by migrating edges of cells as a parameter,
calculated as (invaded area at a certain time/spheroid area
at initial time) × 100. Data were analyzed using ImageJ
image analysis software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

in lysates was measured using a Wallac 148 Wizard 3
gamma-counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Science,
Shelton, CT, USA) and normalized to protein content.

Gene expression microarray and gene ontology
analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of GBM-TSs
using a Qiagen miRNA kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Expression profiles of drug-treated groups and
controls were obtained using Illumina HumanHT-12
v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA). Data were log2 transformed and normalized
according to the quantile normalization method using
BRB-ArrayTools developed by Dr. Richard Simon and
the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team. Genes showing
minimal variation across the set of arrays were excluded
from the analysis. Genes whose expression differed from
the median by at least 1.5-fold in at least 20% of the
arrays were retained. Heatmaps were generated and gene
ontology analyses were performed using BRB-ArrayTools
and GENE-E from broad institute.

LDH assay
Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring LDH
released into culture media. Cells were plated in 96-well
plates at a density of 10 cells per well. After 24 h, cells
were treated with 2DG (4 mM), metformin (5 mM or 15
mM), a combination of 2DG (4 mM) and metformin (5
mM) for 3 weeks. The amount of LDH in the medium
was determined using a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive
Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10μl of Lysis
Solution (10X) per 100μl of medium was added to each
well followed by incubation for 45 minutes in a humidified
chamber at 37°C, 5% CO2. After centrifuge of the plate at
250 × g for 4 minutes, 50μl aliquots were transferred to a
fresh 96-well flat-bottom (enzymatic assay) plate. After
adding 50μl of the reconstituted Substrate Mix, the plate
was covered with foil to protect it from light, incubated
at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by the
addition of 50μl of Stop Solution. Absorbance at 490 nm
was determined using a microplate reader.

Orthotopic xenograft animal model for the
assessment of survival
Male athymic nude mice (4–8 weeks old; Central
Lab. Animal Inc., Seoul, Korea) were used for experiments.
Mice were housed in micro-isolator cages under sterile
conditions and observed for at least 1 week before study
initiation to ensure proper health. Lighting, temperature,
and humidity were controlled centrally. All experimental
procedures were approved by our Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Mice were anesthetized with
a solution of Zoletil (30 mg/kg; Virbac Korea, Seoul,
Korea) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Bayer Korea, Seoul,
Korea) delivered intraperitoneally. GBM TSs (GSC11)
were implanted into the right frontal lobe of nude mice
using a guide-screw system within the skull. Mice
received 5 × 105 cells via a Hamilton syringe (Dongwoo
Science Co., Seoul, Korea) inserted to a depth of 4.5 mm.
Then, HL156A (30 or 45 mg/kg), TMZ (30 mg/kg), their
combination, metformin(500 mg/kg) and metformin and
TMZ combination were administrated to mice (n = 5 mice/
group). HL156A and metformin was administered orally
every other day throughout the duration of the experiment,
and TMZ was administrated intraperitoneally for 5 days
beginning the day of TS injection. The body weights of
mice were checked every other day. If weight decreased
by more than 15% compared to the original body weight,
mice were euthanized according to the approved protocol.
At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized and
their brains were carefully removed, sectioned, mounted
on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) for microscopic analysis of gliomagenesis.

ATP assay
For the comparison of ATP levels in TS, the
CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) was used. Cells were
plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per
well. After 24 h, they were treated with 4 mM of 2DG, 5
mM of metformin alone, their combination or 15 mM of
metformin for 3 days. ATP assay was conducted according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. A volume of CellTiterGlo® Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium
present in each well was added. Cells were incubated at
room temperature for 10 minutes, and luminescence was
recorded.

Uptake of 18F-FDG
GSC11 cells were plated on 12-well plates at 3 × 105
cells per well, and incubated for 24 hours. The medium
was changed to glucose-free DMEM (Gibco) containing
approximately 0.5 μCi of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(18F-FDG), and then cells were incubated for 15 minutes.
The cells were washed three times with PBS, and 0.1 ml
of lysis buffer was added to each well. The lysed cells
were then harvested, and the amount of radioactivity
