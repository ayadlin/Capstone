BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether specific single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) from nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways are associated with sensitivity to trabectedin in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS). METHODS: The authors analyzed excision repair cross-complementation group 5/xeroderma pigmentosum group G (ERCC5/XPG) (NER), excision repair
cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) (NER), and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) (HR) SNPs and messenger RNA expression levels in tumor specimens from 113 patients with advanced STS who were enrolled in previously published phase
2 trials or in a compassionate-use program. The 6-month progression-free rate (PFR), progression-free survival (PFS),
and overall survival (OS) were analyzed according to ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 status using log-rank tests.
RESULTS: High expression of the common allele (aspartic acid at codon 1104) of ERCC5, high expression of ERCC1,
and BRCA1 haplotype were associated significantly with improved PFR, PFS, and OS. The ERCC1 thymine-to-cytosine
(T!C) SNP at codon 19007 and BRCA1 expression were not associated with outcome. On univariate analysis, tumor
histology, favorable NER status (high expression of common ERCC5 and/or high ERCC1 expression status), and favorable BRCA1 haplotype (at least 1 triple-adenine plus guanine [AAAG] allele) were the sole variables associated significantly with PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 status represented a
potential DNA repair signature that could be used for the prediction of clinical response to trabectedin in patients

Trabectedin is approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) after failure on anthracyclines and ifosfamide or when patients with STS are not eligible to receive these agents. In this setting, the
6-month progression-free rate (PFR) is approximately 35% to 40%.1-5 Therefore, the identification of biomarkers that
can predict a clinical benefit from trabectedin in patients with STS is a crucial issue, because it would allow a more accurate
identification of potential responders.
Although the exact mechanism of action of trabectedin has not been fully elucidated, previous in vitro studies demonstrated that it depends on the status of both the nucleotide excision repair (NER) DNA repair pathway and the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway.6-10 NER is involved in the repair of DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet
light, carcinogens, or platinum-based regimens that are used in chemotherapy.11 HR is involved predominantly in the
repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during S-phase or G2-phase of the cell cycle using the second undamaged
chromosome as a template.12 Several preclinical studies have reported that NER-deficient cells were more resistant to trabectedin than their NER-proficient counterparts.6,7,9,10,13 Indeed, it has been suggested that trabectedin adducts induce a

Patients
This study included consenting patients with advanced
STS who were treated between 1999 and 2008 in
previously published phase 2 trials2,4 or in a compassionate-use program that was open to patients with all
types of STS who had failed on conventional chemotherapy for advanced disease.1 The inclusion of
patients in this study was based on the availability of
tumor material for molecular experiments. This study
was approved by the institutional review board of
each participating institution.

ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 Messenger RNA
Expression
Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the BRCA1, ERCC1
and ERCC5 genes were analyzed centrally in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumor specimens at PangaeaBiotech
S.A. (Barcelona, Spain). For samples that contained
<80% tumor cells, laser-captured microdissection was
performed before mRNA extraction. Quantification of
gene expression was performed using the ABI Prism
7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif). The following primers and 50 -labeled
fluorescent reporter dye (6-FAM) probes were used: For
b-actin, the forward primer was 50 -TGA GCG CGG
CTA CAG CTT-30 , the reverse primer was 50 -TCC TTA
ATG TCA CGC ACG ATT T-30 , and the 50 -FAM ACC
ACC ACG GCC GAG CGG 30 -tetramethylrhodamine
(TAMRA) probe was used. For BRCA1, the forward
primer was 50 -GGC TAT CCT CTC AGA GTG ACA
TTT TA-30 , the reverse primer was 50 -GCT TTA TCA
GGT TAT GTT GCA TGG T-30 , and the minor groove
binder (MGB) 50 -FAM CCA CTC AGC AGA GGG30 nonfluoresecent quencher (NFQ) probe was used. For
ERCC1, the forward primer was 50 -GGG AAT TTG
GCG ACG TAA TTC-30 , the reverse primer was 50 GCG GAG GCT GAG GAA CAG-30 , and the 50 -FAM
CAC AGG TGC TCT GGC CCA GCA CAT A 30 TAMRA probe was used. For ERCC5, the forward primer
was 50 -GAA GCG CTG GAA GGG AAG AT-30 , the
reverse primer was 50 -GAC TCC TTT AAG TGC TTG
GTT TAA CC-30 , and the MGB 50 -FAM CTG GCT
GTT GAT ATT AGC ATT 30 -NFQ probe was used.
Relative gene expression quantification was calculated
according to the comparative DDCt method using b-actin
as an endogenous control and commercial RNA controls
(Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif; Applied Biosystems) as calibrators. In all experiments, only triplicates that had a Ct
standard deviation (SD) value <0.20 were accepted. In
addition, for each sample that was analyzed, a reverse transcriptase minus control was run in the same plate to assure
lack of genomic DNA contamination.

Treatment and Response Assessment
The majority of patients received trabectedin at a dose of
1.3 to 1.5 mg/m2 either as a 3-hour infusion or on a 24hour continuous infusion schedule, as described previously.2,4 Tumor assessment (by computed tomography
scan or magnetic resonance imaging) usually was performed every 8 weeks in all patients using the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

Genotyping of ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1
SNPs
Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded
tissues according to previously published procedures.19
For Holland Bouin-fixed tissues, sections were washed
with lithium carbonate to remove picric acid. Then, tissues were washed with 1 TNE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH
8.0; 1 mM ethylene diamine tetracetic acid, pH 8.0; 100

trapping of NER factors, resulting in increased levels of cytotoxic DNA damage.10,13 It also has been suggested that
excision repair cross-complementation group 5 (ERCC5)
(xeroderma pigmentosum group G [XPG]) endonuclease
is the main NER protein involved in this process.8,14 In
addition, it was demonstrated that cells deficient in HR
were more sensitive to trabectedin than their normal counterparts because of the persistence of DNA lesions and
increased formation of replication-dependent DSBs.9 It is
noteworthy that breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), a key regulator
involved in DNA end resection during HR,15 was part of
the in vitro expression signature of genes associated with
sensitivity to trabectedin treatment.16
In addition, several studies have revealed that single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DNA repair
genes, such as ERCC1, ERCC5, and BRCA1, were associated with an increased cancer risk or an altered response to
DNA-damaging agents that are used in chemotherapy,
particularly platinum-based regimens.17,18 Altogether,
these data suggest that the status of a discrete number of
DNA repair genes from NER and/or HR might be used
as biomarkers to indicate a potential clinical benefit from
treatment with trabectedin. This possibility prompted us
to evaluate whether ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 expression and SNP status could be associated with clinical benefit from trabectedin in patients with advanced STS.

mM NaCl), and DNA was purified on GFX columns
(GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Saclay, France) after
digestion with proteinase K (2 mg/mL at 55 C for at least
2 hours).
Genotyping for the ERCC5 aspartic acid (Asp)-tohistidine (His) amino acid change at codon 1104
(Asp1104His) (reference SNP no. rs17655) was performed by pyrosequencing. Briefly, 100 ng of genomic
DNA were amplified with specific primers. Pyrosequencing primers were designed using the Pyrosequencing SNP
Primer Design software (version 1.01; Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). For polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis, 10 pmole of each primer (forward, AGGAAA
GAATACATGCGGTGGA; reverse, 50 -biotinylated
primer GAAGCACTGG TTTTTGGCTCTTT) were
used. The reaction was performed in a buffer that contained 3mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U Taq polymerase platinum
(Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) in a 50-lL final volume. The mixture was denatured for 5 minutes at 94 C;
then, 35 cycles were carried out for 30 seconds at 94 C,
30 seconds at 58 C, and 30 seconds at 72 C. For pyrosequencing, single-stranded DNA was prepared from 40 lL
of biotinylated PCR product using streptavidin-coated
Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and 0.37 lM of the
adequate sequencing primer (TCTGATGGATCTTCAAGTG) for analysis. Sequencing was performed with
the SNP Gold reagent kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Genotyping of the ERCC5 Asp1104His SNP
(rs17655), the ERCC1 thymine-to-cytosine (T!C) amino
acid change at codon 19007 (asparagine [Asn]118Asn)
(rs11615), and the 4 BRCA1 SNPs (the glycine-to-glutamic
acid amino acid change at codon 742 [Gly742Glu;
rs16941], the arginine-to-lysine amino acid change at
codon 1183 [Arg1183Lys; rs16942], the glycine-to-serine
amino acid change at codon 1613 [Gly1613Ser;
rs1799966], and the proline-to-leucine amino acid change
at codon 871 [Pro871Leu; rs799917]) also were performed
using Golden Gate technology from Illumina on a bead
array platform according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Illumina, San Diego, Calif) using 150 ng of
genomic DNA per patient as starting material. Raw hybridization intensity data processing, clustering, and genotype
calling were performed using the genotyping module in the
Genome Studio package (Illumina). For BRCA1, haplotypes and frequency estimation were obtained using Haploview software (Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT,
Cambridge, Mass). DNA extractions and SNP determination were centralized at INSERM U916.

Cell Culture
ERCC5-deficient XPCS1RO (94RD27) simian virus 40
(SV40)-transformed fibroblasts were a kind gift from Dr.
S. G. Clarckson (Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center, Geneva,
Switzerland). These cells are lacking functional ERCC5
because of a homozygous thymine (T) deletion at position
2972, resulting in a truncation of the last 206 amino acids
of the C-terminal region of the protein.20 The cells were
cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 C in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
ERCC5-Green Fluorescent Protein Constructs
A 3558 base-pair cDNA fragment of the variant allele of
ERCC5 human gene (cytosine [C ]at position 3310) was
generated by PCR using the following primers: sense, 50 AGCCGCCCCATGGGGGTCCA-30 ; and antisense, 50 TGGTTTTCCTTTTTCTTCCCCT CGCACGTCT30 . Then, the PCR product was cloned into the
pcDNA3.1/CT-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TOPO
plasmid using the TOPO TA cloning system (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The wild-type
ERCC5-GFP construct was generated by mutagenic PCR
according to the QuickchangeII XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene (Agilent Technologies,
Massy, France) using 125 ng of the primer 50 -CATCTGATGGATCTTCAAGTGAAGATGCTGA AAGTTCATC-30 and 125 ng of its reverse complement.
Mutagenesis was performed on 10 ng of double-stranded
substrate using the following PCR conditions: 95 C for
1 minute; then 18 cycles at 95 C for 50 seconds, 60 C
for 50 seconds, and 68 C for 10 minutes; followed by 7
minutes at 68 C. The reaction mixture was then incubated with 10 U Dpn1 to remove the parental strand.
The full sequence of each ERCC5-GFP construct was
verified, and the SNP sequence was confirmed by pyrosequencing. Expression of each construct was verified by
confocal microscopy in transiently transfected HeLa cells
(results not shown).
Flow Cytometry and Apoptosis Measurement
Approximately 104 XPCS1RO cells were seeded onto 96well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected
with 50 ng of either control (GFP) vector or wild-type or
variant ERCC5-GFP constructs using the Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) with
an 8:2 transfection reagent/DNA ratio. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the cells were treated with various

concentrations of trabectedin (a kind gift from Pharmamar S.A., Madrid, Spain) for 24 hours, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 200 nM
tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) (Invitrogen) in the presence of 20 lM verapamil for 30 minutes at
37 C. Next, the cells were detached by trypsin and resuspended in 150 lL of a buffer that contained 130 mM
NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM NaHCO3,
0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4.5
g/L glucose, and 4% fetal calf serum. Analyses were performed immediately using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont-De-Claix, France).
For multiparametric 2-color staining, logarithmic signals
were collected using the following filters: GFP (FL1; 530/
30 band-pass filter) and TMRM (FL2; 585/42 band-pass
filter). Data acquisition was performed with CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson). For each drug concentration, the number of apoptotic cells (TMRM-positive
cells) was counted in the population of green cells that
expressed the different GFP constructs; then, the percentage of apoptotic cells was plotted as a function of drug
concentration.

Statistical Analyses
The statistical analyses of baseline demographics and
clinical outcome were based on all data available up
to the cutoff date of January 30, 2010. Descriptive
statistics were used to clarify the distribution of variables in the population. The 6-month PFR was
defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a
complete response, partial response, or stable disease
for 6 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) was
defined as the interval between the date of the first
cycle of trabectedin and the time of disease progression, death, or last follow-up. Overall survival (OS)
was defined as the interval between the date of the
first cycle of trabectedin and the time of death or
last follow-up. PFS and OS rates were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared
using the log-rank test. Univariate analyses included
the following variables: age; sex; performance status;
grade; histologic subtype; number of metastatic sites;
ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 gene expression levels;
and SNP status. Analyses were performed using SPSS
statistical software (version 12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Ill). All statistical tests were 2 sided, and P < .05
was considered statistically significant.

were entered into the current study.

60 patients (53%) were homozygous for the common
guanine (G) allele (G/G genotype; Asp/Asp), 15 patients
(13%) were homozygous for the rare allele (C/C genotype; His/His), and 38 patients (34%) were heterozygous
(G/C genotype; Asp/His). ERCC5 mRNA levels were
measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR but
could be obtained for only 65 patients. The median DDCt
value for ERCC5 mRNA expression was 1.36, and the
patients were classified into either a ‘‘high-expression’’
group or a ‘‘low-expression’’ group based on whether their
mRNA level was above or below this value.
Genotypes for the ERCC1 Asn118Asn SNP were
available for 63 patients and revealed that 3 patients (5%)
were homozygous for the rare allele (C/C genotype), 20
patients (32%) were homozygous for the common allele
(T/T genotype), and 40 patients (63%) were heterozygous. Quantification of ERCC1 mRNA levels could be
obtained for 40 patients. The median DDCt value for
ERCC1 mRNA expression was 3.73, and the patients
were classified into either a ‘‘high-expression’’ group or a
‘‘low-expression’’ group based on whether their ERCC1
mRNA level was above or below this value.
The 4 BRCA1 SNPs (rs16941, rs16942,
rs1799966, and rs799917; in the indicated order) were
genotyped in 59 patients. Among the 16 possible haplotypes, 2 haplotypes, AAAG and GGGA, represented

Cancer

August 1, 2011

approximately 90% of the population with a frequency
of 0.488 and 0.359, respectively. Other haplotypes had a
frequency <0.1. Patients were grouped into 2 categories
based on the presence of the most frequent haplotype
(AAAG) in to those who had at least 1 AAAG allele (46
patients) and patients who had no AAAG allele (13
patients). Quantification of BRCA1 mRNA levels were
obtained for 36 patients. The median DDCt value for
BRCA1 mRNA expression was 2.17, and the patients
were classified into a ‘‘high-expression’’ group or a ‘‘lowexpression’’ group based on whether their BRCA1
mRNA level was above or below this value.
Patients’ Treatment Outcomes
The median follow-up was 10 months (range, 0.6-96
months). One complete response, 18 partial responses, and
26 disease stabilizations that lasted for >6 months were
observed. The median PFS was 3.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-4.4 months), and the 6-month
and 1-year PFS rates were 40% (95% CI, 31%-49%) and
22% (95% CI, 14%-29%), respectively (Fig. 1).
At the time of the current analysis, 81 patients had
died, and 32 patients remained still alive. The median OS
was 13.6 months (95% CI, 8.7-18.5 months), and the 6month and 1-year OS rates were 75% (95% CI, 67%83%) and 54% (95% CI, 45%-63%), respectively (Fig. 1).

Association of ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1
Status With Clinical Response to Trabectedin
We observed that high expression of the common ERCC5
allele (Asp) was associated with improved outcome.
Indeed, the PFR was significantly higher in the group of
patients who had high expression of common ERCC5

3450

than in the group of patients who had low expression of
the common ERCC5 genotype or the rare ERCC5
genotype regardless of its expression level (69% vs 33.5%;
P ¼ .019). Moreover, stratified analyses indicated that
improved PFS was limited to patients who had tumors
that were homozygous for the common allele (Asp). In

(ERCC5)-deficient cells that were transfected transiently either with the control pcDNA3.1-green fluorescent protein
(GFP) vector (blue) or with vectors that expressed either the
common form (green) or the rare form (purple) of ERCC5GFP. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of trabectedin for 24 hours,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with
tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester to quantify apoptotic
cells by flow cytometry as described in the text (see Materials and Methods). The percentage of apoptotic cells within
the population of cells that expressed GFP or the GFPtagged ERCC5 proteins was plotted as a function of drug
concentrations. Values shown are the mean of 3 independent
experiments. His indicates histidine; Asp, aspartic acid.

(Fig. 2). These results strongly suggest that a proficient
NER system and high expression of the common allele of
ERCC5 (Asp rather than His at position 1104 of the
ERCC5 protein) may have functional impact in terms of
response to trabectedin. To test this hypothesis in vitro,
we analyzed the effects of trabectedin treatment on cellinduced apoptosis between human ERCC5-deficient
XPCSRO1 cells that were complemented transiently with
a control vector that expressed GFP or a plasmid that
expressed the common or the rare allele of the GFPtagged ERCC5 cDNA. We observed that cells expressing
the common allele (Asp) of ERCC5-GFP were significantly more sensitive to trabectedin than control cells that
expressed GFP alone or cells that expressed the rare (His)
allele of ERCC5-GFP (Fig. 3).
ERCC1 Asn118Asn SNP status was not associated
with outcome. Indeed, no difference in terms of PFR was
observed according to ERCC1 Asn118Asn SNP status
(38% rare allele vs 38% 1 or 2 common alleles). However,
the PFR was significantly higher in patients who had high
ERCC1 in expression compared with patients who had
low ERCC1 expression regardless of their SNP status
(52.5% vs 28%; P ¼ .038). High ERCC1 expression also

3452

was associated with an improved median PFS both among
patients who had tumors that were homozygous for the
rare allele (P ¼ .04) and among patients who had tumors
with the common allele (P ¼ .02) (Table 2, Fig. 4). The
same trend was observed for OS. High ERCC1 expression
was associated significantly with an improved median OS
both among patients who had tumors that were homozygous for the rare allele (P ¼ .27) and among patients who
had tumors with the common allele (P ¼ .03), although it
was statistically significant only for the latter group (Table
2, Fig. 4).
Concerning BRCA1, the PFR was significantly
higher for patients who had at least 1 allele of the most frequent AAAG haplotype (Group 1: 47.8% vs 7.7%; P ¼
.01). The same trend was observed for PFS (median PFS:
5.6 months [95% CI, 1.4-9.8 months] vs 2.5 months
[95% CI, 1.3-3.6 months]; P ¼ .03) and OS (median
OS: 14.1 months [95% CI, 4.4-23.8 months] vs 5.4
months [95% CI, 1.7-9.0 months]; P ¼ .0095) (Table 2,
Fig. 5). Conversely, analyses with the second most represented haplotype (GGGA) did not reveal any association
with PFR, PFS, or OS. Similarly, BRCA1 expression was
not associated with the 6-month PFR, PFS, or OS (data
not shown).
Prognostic Factors for PFS and OS
On univariate analysis, tumor histology, favorable NER
status (high expression of common ERCC5 and/or high
ERCC1 expression status), and favorable BRCA1 haplotype (at least 1 AAAG allele) were the sole variables associated significantly with PFS and OS.
Correlation Between NER Status and
Histologic Subtypes
Because favorable NER status (high expression of common ERCC5 and/or high ERCC1 expression status) was
significantly associated with improved PFS, we analyzed
the correlation between NER status and histologic subtypes. We observed that the proportion of translocationrelated sarcoma subtypes (myxoid/round cell liposarcoma,
synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma) was significantly higher in the ‘‘favorable NER status’’ group than in
the other group (59% vs 11%; P ¼ .0001).

DISCUSSION
The current results indicate that high expression of the
ERCC5 gene is strongly associated with improved outcome
in patients with STS who are treated with trabectedin,
confirming previous in vitro studies that demonstrated the

importance of ERCC5 in trabectedin-mediated cytotoxicity.6,7,10,14 It is noteworthy that this effect was observed
only in patients who had tumors that were homozygous for
the common allele (Asp) of the ERCC5 Asp1104His polymorphism. This also is in accordance with our in vitro
results indicating that complementation of ERCC5-deficient cells with the common form of GFP-tagged ERCC5
restored greater sensitivity to trabectedin compared with
cells that were complemented with the rare form. This also
suggests that the presence of His rather than Asp at position
1104 leads to altered activity of ERCC5, resulting in
reduced sensitivity to the drug.

Analysis of ERCC1, another key factor of NER that
acts in concert with the excision repair cross-complementation group 4 (xeroderma pigmentosum group F [XPF])
endonuclease, also revealed that high ERCC1 expression
was associated significantly with better clinical benefit
from trabectedin, suggesting conversely that low expression of ERCC1 would lead to tumor resistance to the
drug. This finding is in accordance with previous studies
in which transformed cells that were deficient for ERCC1
were 7-fold to 8-fold more resistant to trabectedin than
their normal counterparts,21,22 We also evaluated the
association between the T!C ERCC1 SNP at codon 118

and trabectedin response and observed no difference in
terms of clinical benefit from the drug in our population
of patients. It was demonstrated previously that low
ERCC1 expression predicted a benefit from platinumbased chemotherapy.23 However, only a few studies have
investigated the prognostic or predictive value of the
T!C ERCC1 SNP at codon 118, and controversial
results have been reported in patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy.24
Our results also indicated that the proportion of
translocation-related sarcoma subtypes (myxoid/round
cell liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma) was significantly higher in the ‘‘favorable NER status’’ group than in the other group. Several lines of
evidence have indicated that trabectedin is more effective
in translocation-related sarcoma, such as myxoid liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and alveolar soft part sarcoma.25,26 Recent data have suggested that the greater
sensitivity of translocation-related sarcoma is related to
the ability of trabectedin to interact with the fusion gene
product.27 It is noteworthy that, according to the current
results, even in these sarcomas, the NER pathway also
may play a crucial role in trabectedin cytotoxicity through
a mechanism that remains to be investigated.
The current study also indicates a potential link
between BRCA1 genotype and tumor response to trabectedin. Previous studies mainly addressed the impact of
BRCA1 mutations on cell sensitivity to platinum compounds and indicated that such alterations were associated

3454

with tumor sensitivity, probably because of the reduced
activity of BRCA1.28-31 Analyses of several BRCA1 SNPs
also identified haplotypes that potentially may be associated with clinical outcome in patients with gastric or lung
cancer who receive platinum-based chemotherapy.21,22
Whether the specific haplotype identified in our study is
linked to the reduced activity of BRCA1 in HR remains
to be investigated; however, our results indirectly confirm
the role of HR in trabectedin-induced cytotoxicity and
also suggest that this haplotype may be a relevant clinical
marker of response to trabectedin.
Along with its retrospective nature, another limitation of the current study is that we used archival tissues,
which may not be fully characteristic of tumor tissues
before trabectedin treatment because of potential alterations from previous lines of chemotherapy. Therefore, we
cannot exclude the possibility that genotypes and/or
expression levels the of ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1
genes may differ from their initial status at the time of tumor sample resection. This issue, which is inherent to all
biomarker studies in medical oncology, underscores the
need to prospectively confirm our current results in future
clinical trials. Moreover, the limited number of patients
by category did not allow us to use receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis to determine the optimal
threshold for gene expression. This represents another limitation of this study, because the median DDCt value
may not represent the best threshold to define the highexpression and low-expression groups. Furthermore,

although we cannot exclude the prognostic value of
ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 gene status in patients with
sarcoma, and despite our lack of a control group (patients
who did not receive trabectedin), it is likely that the status
of these genes, which are closely related to the mechanism
of action of trabectedin, has predictive value for the efficacy of trabectedin, as also suggested by our functional in
vitro data. Moreover, none of these genes were included
in the prognostic signature recently identified by Chibon
et al.32 Altogether, our data indicate that the status of
ERCC5, ERCC1, and BRCA1 represents a potential DNA
repair signature that could be investigated in future trials
for predicting the clinical response to trabectedin in
patients with advanced STS.
