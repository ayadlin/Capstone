BACKGROUND. Various chemotherapy agents, especially of the alkylating category,
have been associated with premature ovarian failure but there is no quantitative
evidence of chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage in humans. The aim was to

quantify the impact of chemotherapy on primordial follicle reserve and stromal
function in human ovary with a prospective controlled quantitative histologic
and in vitro study.

METHODS. Samples from 26 patients who were undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation were assessed histologically and for in vitro
estradiol production. Of the 26 patients, 10 had previously received chemotherapy whereas 16 had not (control). There were 17 age-matched patients. Primordial follicle counts and in vitro estrogen production were compared between agematched control and chemotherapy patients as well as between those who did
and did not receive alkylating agents.

RESULTS. Patients who received chemotherapy had significantly lower primordial
follicle counts than control patients (5.4  1.32 vs 9.6  2.2, P 5 .05). Furthermore patients treated with alkylating regimens had significantly lower primordial
follicle counts compared with those who received nonalkylating agents (2.9  1.1
vs 7.9  1.6, P < .05) and with those who did not receive any chemotherapy
(2.9  1.1 vs 9.6  2.2, P < .05). In vitro, ovarian cortical pieces from individuals
who were previously exposed to chemotherapy (chemotherapy group) produced
significantly less estradiol compared with those who were not (control group). In
the chemotherapy group, there was no difference in in vitro estradiol production
between those who received alkylating agents and those who did not.

CONCLUSIONS. This is the first quantitative evidence of the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian infrastructure, and shows that, whereas alkylating agents can significantly reduce ovarian reserve, both alkylating and nonalkylating regimens
may affect ovarian stromal function. Cancer 2007;110:2222–9.  2007 American

O

ne of the major quality of life issues for young cancer survivors
is preserving gonadal function and fertility. On the basis of clinical studies, it is known that the alkylating agents are associated with
the highest risk of infertility.1 Nevertheless, nearly the entire body of
information on the impact of cancer treatments on human fertility
is based on the crude assessment of menstrual function, which is
not a sensitive marker of fertility.2 Although animal studies have
demonstrated the impact of these agents on primordial follicle
reserve,3,4 there could be significant discrepancies between the

ovarian biology of rodents and humans. Furthermore, based on studies in the rodent, the main
mode of infertility and ovarian failure by chemotherapy is believed to be through follicular destruction,
but the impact of cancer treatments on ovarian stromal cells has not been studied. Because ovarian stromal cells play an important role in ovarian endocrine
function, and speculatively in post-chemotherapy
damage repair,5 assessment of chemotherapy-associated damage is important.
The main aim of this study was to quantify and
compare the impact of chemotherapy on primordial
follicle density in human ovarian cortical pieces
obtained from cancer patients who were undergoing
ovarian tissue cryopreservation before or after receiving chemotherapy. Furthermore, we ascertained
whether the stromal function is altered in patients
who were exposed to chemotherapy by ovarian estradiol production in vitro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Ovarian samples were obtained from 26 patients who
were undergoing ovarian cryopreservation for fertility
preservation. The research protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Cornell University.
None of the subjects had an underlying metabolic or
endocrinologic illness, used any hormonal treatment,
smoked, or had ovarian metastasis. Twenty-three
subjects were diagnosed with various types of solid
and hematologic cancers, of whom 13 had not yet
received any chemotherapy (control), whereas 10
had prior chemotherapy. Of those 10 patients an
equal number received alkylating and nonalkylating
regimens. The remaining 3 had various hematologic
illnesses and had undergone tissue sampling before
myeloablative conditioning for hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation.
Reagents
Alpha-MEM culture medium and fetal bovine serum
were purchased from Gibco (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif). Recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) was from Serono (Rockland, Mass). The estradiol kit was from DPC (Diagnostic Products, Los
Angeles, Calif ).
Histomorphometric Evaluation
From each subject, 1 5 3 5 3 3 mm ovarian cortical
piece was fixed overnight, paraffin-embedded, and
serially sectioned at 7 lm thickness to determine primordial follicle density. primordial follicles were
counted in every fifth section (35 lm apart) using an

2223

Olympus BX-41 microscope under 3 200 magnification (11–28 sections per sample). To avoid duplicate
counting in each section, only the primordial follicles
with visible oocyte nuclei were recorded. Follicle
density was determined per mm2 of tissue surface
and a mean value was obtained from all sections.

Ovarian Tissue Culture
One ovarian cortical piece from each subject was
cultured in alpha-MEM culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300-mIU/mL
recombinant FSH for 7 days. Due to tissue limitation,
ovarian cortical cultures could be performed in only
18 subjects. Half of the culture medium was removed
and replaced daily and stored at 2808C until assayed
for estradiol (E2) by radioimmunoassay (RIA). primordial follicle density was evaluated in serial sections before and after the 7-day culture.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Mann-Whitney Utests were used in comparing means of various
groups, where appropriate. Spearman test was used
for correlation analyses (SPSS v. 11, Chicago, Ill). Graphic bars and curves were created using GraphPad
Prism software (San Diego, CA). A P-value .05 was
considered significant.

RESULTS
Validation of Follicle Counts
Patient ages, chemotherapy protocols, and their primordial follicle counts are shown in Table 1. The
mean age  standard error (SE) of all patients was
27  2 with a range of 4 to 44. The baseline follicle
density inversely correlated with age in both controls
and chemotherapy patients (r 5 20.98, P < .0001,
and r 5 20.82, P < .001, respectively). When all control and chemotherapy patients were analyzed together the statistical significance still persisted
(r 5 20.96, P < .0001, Fig. 1). The correlation of age
with follicle density has been previously shown6 and
validates the accuracy of our assessment of follicle
counts.
Impact of chemotherapy on primordial follicle density
Patients who received any chemotherapy (n 5 16)
versus those who did not (n 5 10) had similar mean
ages (26.7  3.1 vs 27.4  1.9, P 5 .15). When primordial follicle densities of these 2 groups were compared regardless of the type of regimen, those who
received chemotherapy had significantly lower follicle counts (5.4  1.32 vs 9.6  2.2, P 5 .05).

The samples from patients who received alkylating regimens (CHOP, VACA, AC) had diminished follicle density compared with those

18-year-old with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
This patient had already received 2 courses of a nonalkylating regimen (ADE-GMTZ; arabinoside-C
2000 mg/m2 every 12 hours for 5 days; daunorubicin
45 mg/m2/d for 2 days; etoposide 350 mg/m2 for
5 days; and gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Her baseline
primordial follicle density was comparable to an agematched patient with Hodgkin disease who had not
yet received chemotherapy (14.4  1.6 vs 15.3  1.8,
P > .05). A 22-year-old patient who had received
1 course of standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide
750 mg/m2; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2; vincristine
1.4 mg/m2; and prednisone 40 mg/m2) for nonHodgkin lymphoma had a baseline primordial follicle
density significantly lower than the density of an
age-matched patient who did not yet receive chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease (6.17  0.7 vs 16.6  3.5,
P < .001). After the ovarian tissue sampling this 22year-old patient received 3 additional courses of

CHOP chemotherapy every 3 weeks, followed by 4
courses of ICE (ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide)
treatment before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). At 6-month follow-up after the HSCT
the patient had an FSH value of 67.3 IU/mL, confirming premature ovarian failure. In another patient,
age 33, who had received 7 courses of standard
CHOP for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, baseline primordial follicle density was significantly lower than the 2
age-matched control patients with breast cancer
(1.5  0.65 vs 5.23  1.1, P < .01 and 1.5  0.65 vs
5.66  0.9, P < .01). Although this patient had
received a GnRH agonist treatment (leuprolide acetate) during the courses of chemotherapy, her follicle
density was significantly lower than the untreated
controls (Fig. 3). Furthermore, despite the GnRH agonist use, her FSH was 20.8 mIU/mL on cycle Day 3
(upper limit of normal 11.8), consistent with compromised ovarian function.2

Of the 2 patients aged 24, the baseline primordial
follicle density of the patient with Hodgkin disease
who received a nonalkylating regimen (6 courses of
ABVD: adriamycin 25 mg/m2; bleomycin 10 mg/m2;
vinblastin 6 mg/m2; dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 on Days
1 and 15 repeated every 4 weeks) before ovarian sampling was significantly higher than a patient of the
same age with synovial carcinoma who had received
an alkylating regimen (VACA, cyclophosphamide
1200 mg/m2 weeks 1, 4, 7; doxorubicin 60 mg/m2
weeks 1, 7; actinomycin D 1.5 mg/m2 week 4; vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 weeks 1–4) plus inguinal radiotherapy
(600 cGy) 10 years prior (7.6  1.7 vs 4.52  0.89,
P < .05). This 24-year-old patient with synovial sarcoma of the left hip had received her chemotherapy
when she was 14 years old and her current ovarian
reserve was similar to that of a 33-year-old control
(4.52  0.89 vs 5.66  0.9, P > .05). After the ovarian
cryopreservation procedure the patient received 2
courses of ifosfamide-etoposide (ifosfamide 1800 mg/m2
and etoposide 100 mg/m2). Fifteen months after receiving this chemotherapy her FSH was elevated to
19.6 from the pretreatment level of 6.83 IU/mL.
A 32-year old patient who had received 6 courses
of ABVD for Hodgkin disease had a significantly
higher follicle count than an age-matched patient
treated with 4 courses of AC (adriamycin 60 mg/m2
IV on Day 1, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV on
Day 1, a total of 4 cycles every 21 days) for breast
cancer (4.8  1.5 vs 2.37  1.1, P < .05).
The baseline follicle density of a 28-year-old
patient who had received cytarabine (100 mg/m2 per
day by continuous infusion for 7 days) and idarubicin (9 mg/m2 3 times) as an induction therapy for
AML before ovarian sampling was comparable to
another age-matched control patient with Hodgkin
disease (6.77  1.3 vs 6.83  2.5, P > .05).

Overall impact of alkylating agents on ovarian reserve
To further validate the matched comparisons, we
compared the mean follicle densities between those
who received alkylating agents and who those did
not. The mean age difference between those treated
with alkylating regimens (CHOP, AC, VACA, and BEACOPP) and those who had received nonalkylating
regimens (ABVD, idarubucin-cytarabin, etopsidemethotrexate, and ADE-GMTZ) did not reach statistical significance (29.8  2.9 vs 25  2.3, P > .05).
However, the mean primordial follicle count of those
who had received an alkylating agent was significantly lower (2.9  1.1 vs 7.9  1.6, P < .05). The primordial follicle density in those who received
nonalkylating agents was similar to that of controls
(7.9  1.6 vs 9.6  2.2, P > .05).

Assessment of the Impact of Chemotherapy on
Ovarian Stromal Function
Comparability of ovarian culture samples in
chemotherapy and control groups
Among the patients whose tissue samples were used
for in vitro culture the mean age of patients, baseline
and postculture follicle density, as well as the mean
percentage of follicle loss were similar in the treatment and control groups (Table 2).
Comparison of in vitro estradiol production between
chemotherapy and control groups
In culture, ovarian cortical pieces that were previously exposed to chemotherapy secreted significantly less estradiol compared with controls. Daily
levels of estradiol in both groups are illustrated in
Figure 4A. The mean estradiol levels on each day of
culture (Fig. 4A, P < .05) and for the entire duration
of the culture period (Table 2, P 5 .01) were significantly lower in the chemotherapy group compared
with controls. On correlation analysis, mean estradiol levels inversely correlated with age in the control group (r 5 20.7, P < .05) whereas such a
correlation did not exist with the chemotherapy
group (r 5 20.36, P 5 .3; Fig. 4B,C, respectively). As
expected, neither daily estradiol values nor mean
estradiol levels correlated with primordial follicle
counts in both groups. In postculture serial sections,
100% of follicles were in primordial stage, ruling out
the possibility that the difference in estradiol production originated from developing follicles.
Because primordial follicles do not have aromatase
activity, estradiol production could have only
originated from the stromal cells. As a negative control, estradiol measurements were also performed in
the blank culture media and were undetectable
(< 10 pg/mL).

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 4. In vitro estradiol production is shown in control and chemotherapy groups. Mean estradiol levels from each day of culture were significantly lower in the chemotherapy group compared with controls (*P < .05)
(A). The mean estradiol levels from 1–7 days of culture inversely correlated
with advancing age in (B) controls, this correlation disappeared in the (C)
chemotherapy group.

Comparison of in vitro estradiol production between
patients treated with alkylating and nonalkylating regimens
To determine whether alkylating agents showed a
selective toxicity toward stromal cells as they did for
primordial follicles, we compared in vitro estradiol
production between those samples that were
exposed to alkylating agents and those that were not.
The mean estradiol levels from culture Days 1–7 of
chemotherapy patients who had received alkylating
regimens was not significantly different from those

Our report contains novel observations with practical
implications for young women undergoing chemotherapy. Specifically, to our knowledge we present
the first quantitative evidence in humans that chemotherapy regimens that contain alkylating agents
result in significant loss of ovarian reserve compared
with controls. Furthermore, and more interestingly,
we show that chemotherapy regimens may alter
ovarian stromal function regardless of whether they
contain an alkylating agent, and this effect appears
to be irrespective of the magnitude of germ cell
damage. Previous studies to assess the gonadotoxic
potential of different chemotherapy regimens on
reproductive function were mainly focused on
menstrual activity. As well-established from earlier
studies of reproduction, menstruation is a very weak
indicator of fertility.7 Whereas ovarian reserve markers such as FSH, estradiol, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) measurements7 as well as antral follicle
counts8 can give a better estimate of ovarian reserve
before and after chemotherapy, there are no comprehensive studies evaluating the impact of chemotherapy regimens with these markers nor are these
markers direct measures of ovarian reserve. Ovarian
reserve consists of quiescent primordial follicles that
are established before birth, even though this dogma
has been recently challenged by 2 studies.9,10
The numbers dwindle with age, as a result of follicle growth initiation and apoptotic death.6 Thus,
the most direct assessment of ovarian reserve is by
histological evaluation of primordial follicle counts.
We previously developed and validated methods of
primordial follicle counts in mammalian ovaries,
including humans.11,12 By using this histologic
reserve assessment method on samples obtained
during ovarian tissue cryopreservation procedures,
we were able to quantitatively evaluate the impact of
various chemotherapy regimens on ovarian reserve.
It has been well recognized that alkylating agents
have the most significant negative impact on fertility1 and our work provided the histologic confirmation of this previously observed ovarian impact of
alkylating agents. In rodent models, cyclophosphamide caused a dose-dependent loss in primordial follicles even at doses as low as 20 mg/kg.13 In a mouse
model, a single dose of 200 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide resulted in an 87% reduction in primordial follicle count 72 hours after its intraperitoneal
administration.4 Although we did not have a healthy

control group, there is no evidence that cancer diagnosis itself affects primordial follicle reserve. In our
series the impact of CHOP was strikingly similar to
what was observed in rodent studies4 and in a xenograft model recently described by us.12
Although the incidence of amenorrhea is
reported to be < 40% in young women treated with
AC,14,15 a 32-year-old subject treated with 4 cycles of
AC for breast cancer in this study had an ovarian
reserve that was approximately half that of a similar
age patient who had received 6 cycles of ABVD for
Hodgkin disease. As illustrated by this case, even the
very young patients who continued regular menstruation after receiving the AC regimen may have
diminished ovarian reserve, which will inevitably
translate to premature ovarian failure.7
Data on the gonadotoxic effects of the ABVD
combination suggest that the likelihood of treatment-related infertility is small in women under the
age of 40 provided that no pelvic/abdominal radiation is given.16,17 In our study there were 2 patients
aged 24 and 32 who were diagnosed with Hodgkin
disease and treated with 6 cycles of ABVD. Although
there were no age-matched untreated controls with
Hodgkin disease, both had significantly higher follicle
counts when compared with 2 patients at ages 24
and 32 who were treated with regimens containing
cyclophosphamide. This finding is consistent with
the previous clinical observations that the ABVD protocol is associated with lower rates of amenorrhea.
However, the 24-year-old patient had received inguinal radiation in addition to alkylating agents, which
could have also contributed to lower primordial follicle counts.
The 18-year-old patients treated with 2 cycles of
ADE-GMTZ for AML had an ovarian reserve comparable to an age-matched control, suggesting a less
gonadotoxic profile for this combination regimen.
Consistent with our histologic assessment, in 1 study
2 patients aged 29 and 31 who received 1 to 3
courses of Ara-C and daunorubicin did not develop
premature ovarian failure in 1 and 7 years of followup.18 Likewise, in the case of idarubicin-cytarabin
induction chemotherapy for AML, the follicle densities were comparable to an age-matched control
patient, suggesting that this regimen does not have a
significant impact on ovarian reserve.
Whereas the impact of chemotherapy on primordial follicles has been carefully assessed in animal
studies, there have been no studies on the impact of
these treatments on ovarian stromal function. primordial follicles appear to be hormonally inactive,19,20 and in the absence of developing follicles
the source of ovarian estradiol is ascribed to stromal

cells. Using the in vitro estradiol production as a surrogate, we show for the first time that the previous
exposure to chemotherapy resulted in altered ovarian
stromal function. There were no developing follicles
in the pre- and postculture specimens, indicating
that altered estradiol production truly represented
stromal cell population. Interestingly, aging had a
similar negative effect on in vitro estradiol production as chemotherapy, suggesting that chemotherapy-induced damage may share similarities with agerelated changes. Strikingly, estradiol production was
diminished regardless of the regimen, indicating that
ovarian stromal damage may not be specific to a certain class of agents. All these findings show that the
compromised stromal function in patients treated
with nonalkylating agents might not necessarily be
associated with a striking loss in primordial follicle
counts, in contrast to what is observed in patients
treated with alkylating agents. However, considering
static follicle counts as the sole measure of gonadotoxicity may lead to an underestimation of ovarian
damage, as these stromal alterations may culminate
in premature ovarian failure in the long run. All of
these are novel observations that are being validated
with a human ovarian xenograft model.12
In conclusion, we provide the first quantitative
histologic evidence for chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage and show that cyclophosphamide-based
alkylating regimens resulted in greater reduction
of ovarian reserve in comparison to nonalkylating
regimens.
Furthermore, we show that regardless of whether
they include an alkylating agent, most chemotherapy
regimens may have detrimental effects on ovarian
stromal function. The clinical implications of the latter may become more obvious as the role of the
niche in gonadal stem cell physiology is better
understood.21,22 In the meantime, the impact of
chemotherapy on stromal cell function is being delineated in other organs, such as bone marrow.23
