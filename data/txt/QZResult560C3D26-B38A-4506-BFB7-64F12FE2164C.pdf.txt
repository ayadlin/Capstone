Abstract
Resistance to targeted cancer therapies such as trastuzumab is
a frequent clinical problem not solely because of insufficient
expression of HER2 receptor but also because of the
overriding activation states of cell signaling pathways. Systems
biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in silico testing of
factors, which may confer resistance to targeted therapies.
In this study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic model that
could be interrogated to predict resistance to receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapies and directly test
predictions in vitro and in clinical samples. The new
mathematical model included RTK inhibitor antibody binding, HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/mitogenactivated protein kinase cross-talk, and the regulatory
properties of PTEN. The model was parameterized using
quantitative phosphoprotein expression data from cancer
cell lines using reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative PTEN protein expression was found to be the key
determinant of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in silico,
which was predictive of unseen experiments in vitro using the
PTEN inhibitor bp(V). When measured in cancer cell lines,
PTEN expression predicts sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy;
furthermore, this quantitative measurement is more predictive of response (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval,
1.6–5.5; P < 0.0001) than other pathway components taken in
isolation and when tested by multivariate analysis in a cohort
of 122 breast cancers treated with trastuzumab. For the first
time, a systems biology approach has successfully been used
to stratify patients for personalized therapy in cancer and is
further compelling evidence that PTEN, appropriately measured in the clinical setting, refines clinical decision making
in patients treated with anti-HER2 therapies. [Cancer Res

or gene amplification status is a poor predictor of response with a
very low positive predictive value (1, 2). The documented actual
benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy
versus chemotherapy alone in terms of overall survival is only
modest [96% versus 95%, respectively, at 1 year (1) and 91% versus
87%, respectively, at 4 years (2)]. A large proportion of patients
therefore unnecessarily receive ineffective and expensive treatments with toxic side effects, and there is a need to be able to
identify markers that can be used to predict therapeutic response
and readily applied to the clinic. Activating mutations in the
oncogene PIK3CA and inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene
PTEN are known to regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling and cell proliferation and survival pathways, and
empirically, these have been shown to play a role in resistance to
anti-HER2 therapies in breast cancer (3, 4). However, the evidence
supporting the role of PI3K pathway activation in RTK inhibitor
resistance has only been tested in very small cohorts of patients
retrospectively (n = 55 and n = 47, respectively; refs. 3, 4). Further
evidence is required to support the use of PI3K pathway
biomarkers in the clinic supported by robust preclinical and
clinical evidence.
Kinetic (or dynamic) computational models offer the opportunity to cheaply and efficiently test the efficacy of targeted therapies
in silico (i.e., computationally) as part of the preclinical testing
process (5). However, this methodology is still perceived as esoteric
and not clinically applicable because there are very few successful
examples of when such modeling has changed practice (6). One
notable exception is modeling of ion channels in the heart, which
has helped explain the previously ill-defined action of the drug
ranolazine (7, 8). These modeling data were subsequently used
within a Food and Drug Administration submission as supportive
evidence for mode of action (9).4 In oncology, systems biology has
not yet made the same effect, but the use of therapies targeted
against the products of cellular oncogenes in signaling pathways
lends itself to this approach because these pathways can readily be
modeled using ordinary differential equations (5). To date,
canonical pathways such as the epidermal growth factor receptor
pathway have only been modeled to explain and predict
physiologic phenomena (10–16). However, such models have not
been so helpful for understanding therapeutic interventions
because they frequently fail to include important oncogene and
tumor suppressor nodes, which are fundamental to carcinogenesis
and proven resistance proteins [such as HER2, PTEN, and SRC in
PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
models].

The aim of this study was to address these deficiencies in current
models by (a) developing a new kinetic model that could be
interrogated to predict resistance to RTK inhibitor therapies and
(b) directly test predictions in vitro and in clinical samples.

Materials and Methods
Computational modeling. A kinetic model of heregulin-induced HER2/
3 signaling through MAPK and PI3K pathways was developed based on the
model proposed by Kholodenko and colleagues (13). The whole kinetic
model contains 56 ordinary differentials equations (ODE; S1.1-S1.56)
describing the change of the concentrations of 56 biological entities
(proteins, receptors, and lipid second messengers) involved in MAPK and
PI3K signaling (see Supplementary Table S1). A detailed modeling
methodology and description of the model design is given in S1 and S2
(Supplementary Data—modeling methods and description of mathematical
model). The abbreviations used in the text and ODEs are given in
Supplementary Table S1. All network schemes were designed using the
Edinburgh Pathway Editor (17). The computer model construction, fitting,
and analysis were implemented using the DBsolve package for kinetic modeling
(18) and SimBiology modeling software (MATLAB, The MathWorks, Inc.). The
SBML file of the model is given in ‘‘Supplementary Data—SBML model.xml.’’ The
model parameterization procedure permitted us to describe satisfactorily
experiments of activation in the different branches of the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)/AKT signaling network (see Supplementary Fig. S1) and
determine a set of kinetic parameters of the model (see Supplementary Tables S2
and S3).
Cell culture and collection of lysates. PE04 and BT474 cells were
grown as monolayer cultures in DMEM supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FCS and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/mL) in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC. Time course experiments were set up by
plating cells into 10-cm ø Petri dishes and leaving for 48 h. Cells were then
briefly washed in PBS before transferring to phenol red–free DMEM
containing 5% double charcoal-stripped serum supplemented with
penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/mL) and glutamine (0.3 mg/mL) for a
further 48 h before treatment. Paired lysates were prepared by first treating
relevant dishes with pertuzumab (100 nmol/L) F bpV(pic) (50 nmol)
immediately followed by the addition of heregulin-h (1 nmol/L). Samples
were collected at time points of 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 45, or 60 min; washed in PBS;
and immediately lysed in ice-cold isotonic lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EGTA (pH 8.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100]
supplemented with aprotinin (10 Ag/mL) and a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Lysates were centrifuged for 6 min at 13,000  g and protein
concentrations of supernatants were subsequently determined using the
bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). All cell culture and time course experiments
were performed at least three times, and representative reverse-phase protein
array (RPPA) and Western blot curves were used for the model fitting
procedure described above and to validate model predictions.
Western blotting. Protein lysates were electrophoretically resolved on
either 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight onto Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore). After transfer, membranes were blocked with 1%
blocking agent (Roche) in TBS before probing overnight at 4jC with the
appropriate primary antibody made up in 0.5% blocking agent. Primary
antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: anti–phospho-AKT
(pAKT; Ser473; Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti-AKT (Cell Signaling
Technology) at 1:1,000, anti–phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204; Cell
Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204; Cell
Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti-HER1 (Cell Signaling Technology) at
1:1,000, anti-HER2 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti–phosphoHER2 (Tyr877; Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti-HER3 (Cell
Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti–phospho-HER3 (Tyr1289; Cell Signaling
Technology) at 1:1,000, anti-HER4 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000,
anti-PI3K (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, anti-PTEN (Cell Signaling
Technology) at 1:1,000, and anti–phospho-PTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383; Cell
Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000. Immunoreactive bands were detected
using enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) reagents (Roche) and Hyperfilm

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

ECL film (GE Healthcare). Bands were scanned using an Epson Perfection
4990 scanner and Integrated Optical Density absorbance values were
obtained by densitometric analysis using Labworks gel analysis software
(UVP Life Sciences).
Reverse-phase protein arrays. Denatured and reduced protein lysates
were spotted onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (Eurogentec), as
previously described (19). Three replicates were spotted per sample in
eight 2-fold dilutions. Slides were hydrated in Whatman wash buffer for
5 min and Li-Cor blocking buffer for 1 h (LI-COR Biosciences) and then
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4jC. The following day,
slides were washed in PBS/T at room temperature for 5 min (thrice) before
incubating with far-red fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies diluted
in Li-Cor Odyssey Blocking Buffer (1 AL/2 mL) at room temperature for
45 min with gentle shaking. Slides were then washed in excess PBS/T
(thrice)/PBS (thrice) and allowed to air dry before reading on a Li-Cor
Odyssey scanner at 680 and 780 nm, and images were exported as TIFF files
for further analysis. Slides were stained using the above primary antibodies
(matched total and phosphoproteins duplexed on each slide).
RPPA analysis was performed using MicroVigene RPPA analysis module
(VigeneTech). Spots were quantified by accurate single segmentation, with
actual spot signal boundaries determined by the image analysis algorithm.
Each spot intensity was quantified by measuring the total pixel intensity of
the area of each spot (volume of spot signal pixels), with background
subtraction of 2 pixels around each individual spot. The mean of the
replicates was used for normalization and curve fitting. Curve fitting was
performed using five-parameter logistical nonlinear regression using a joint
estimation approach (‘‘supercurve method’’). The quantification y0
(intensity of curve) or rsu (relative concentration value) of sample dilution
curves was normalized by corresponding total protein.
PIK3CA mutation analysis and copy number quantification. PIK3CA
mutation analysis was performed using the ARMS/Scorpions multiplexed
PCR assay as previously described (20) to detect the four most common
mutations in PIK3CA [H1047L, H1047R (exon 20), E545K, and E542K (exon
9)]. PIK3CA copy number quantification was performed with primers for
PIK3CA and the glucokinase (GCK) gene as the reference gene as previously
described (21). Quantitative PCR was performed on the Rotor-Gene 6000
real-time detection system (Corbett Life Sciences) in 15 AL reaction volumes
containing 2 Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
and 1 Amol/L forward and reverse primers. PCR conditions were 10 min at
95jC followed by 40 cycles consisting of 10 s at 95jC, 15 s at 60jC, and 20 s
at 72jC. DC t was calculated as GCK C t
PIK3CA C t and DC t > 3 was
defined as amplified.
Samples and tissue microarray construction. The population
characteristics of the trastuzumab-treated cohort are summarized in Table 1.
HER2 gene amplification status was confirmed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (DAKO HER2 FISH PharmDx, Ely). The study was approved by
the Lothian Research Ethics Committee (08/S1101/41). Following H&E
sectioning of representative tumor blocks, tumor areas were marked for
tissue microarray (TMA) construction and 0.6 mm2 cores were placed into
three separate TMA replicates for each sample, as previously described (22).
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence for PTEN was performed
using methods previously described (23). Briefly, 3-Am TMA slides were
deparaffinized and antigen retrieved by pressure cooking in 0.15 mmol/L
sodium citrate buffer at pH 6. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked with
2.5% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min and nonspecific binding was blocked
with serum-free protein block for 15 min. Slides were then incubated with
primary antibodies diluted in 0.025% PBST for 1 h at room temperature
[AE1/AE3 mouse monoclonal cytokeratin antibody, rabbit polyclonal to
PTEN (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:100 and 1:25, respectively]. After washing in
0.025% PBST, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
secondary antibodies, which included an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat
anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:100 in 0.1 mol/L TBS and prediluted goat
anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase–decorated
dextran polymer backbone (EnVision, Dako). Slides were then incubated for
10 min with Cy5-tyramide, which is activated by horseradish peroxidase, to
visualize HER2 expression. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular
Probes) was used to stain the nuclear compartment.

AQUA automated image analysis. A detailed description of the AQUA
methodology is available elsewhere (23). Pan-cytokeratin antibody was used to
identify infiltrating tumor cells and normal epithelial cells, DAPI counterstain to
identify nuclei, and Cy5-tyramide detection for target (PTEN) for compartmentalized (tissue and subcellular) analysis of tissue sections. Monochromatic
images of each TMA core were captured at 20 objective using an Olympus
AX-51 epifluorescence microscope, and high-resolution digital images were
analyzed by the AQUAnalysis software. Briefly, a binary epithelial mask was
created from the cytokeratin image of each TMA core. If the epithelium
comprised <5% of total core area, the core was excluded from analysis.
Similar binary masks were created for cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments
based on DAPI staining of nuclei. PTEN expression was quantified by
calculating the Cy5 fluorescent signal intensity on a scale of 0 to 255 within each
image pixel, and the AQUA score was generated by dividing the sum of Cy5
signal within the epithelial mask by the area of the cytoplasmic compartment.
Statistical analysis methods. AQUA scores were averaged from replicate
cores. To reduce type I error that can result from using the minimum P value
method for determining the cutpoint value for PTEN expression in KaplanMeier analysis (24), we used X-Tile, which allows determination of an optimal
cutpoint while correcting for the use of minimum P statistics (25). Two
methods of statistical correction for the use of minimal P approach were
used: the first calculation of a Monte-Carlo P value and, for the second, the

Miller-Siegmund minimal P correction (24). Overall survival was subsequently assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank for determining statistical
significance. Relative risk was assessed by the univariate and multivariate Cox
proportional hazards model. Comparison of differences in means in vitro was
performed using the Student’s t test. All calculations and analyses were two
tailed where appropriate and done with SPSS 14.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
Development of a mathematical model to predict responses
to RTK inhibitors. To systematically assess resistance factors to
anti-RTK therapy in cancer biopsies, we developed a kinetic
mathematical model of MAPK/PI3K signaling and used it to predict
consequences of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody therapeutic intervention (a full kinetic mathematical model description is given in
Supplementary Data—modeling methods and mathematical model
description). We developed it to describe HER2 inhibitor antibody/
receptor binding, HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/MAPK
cross-talk, and the kinetic and regulatory properties of PTEN (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Figs. S2–S4 and S10). The design of our model
was also based on modeling studies of the HER signaling network

(13, 26–28). The inclusion of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN was
deemed particularly important because it is a key negative regulator
of the PI3K signaling pathway (29), and it has been implicated as a
resistance mechanism to trastuzumab in breast cancer (3, 4);

however, the effect of quantitative decreases in protein expression,
which is more commonly seen than mutation or epigenetic regulation,
is unknown. The new model, including a PTEN subsystem, explicitly
describes the competition between the lipid and protein phosphatase

activities of PTEN, autodephosphorylation, and the balance and
interchange between the active (PTEN) and inactive (pPTEN) forms
of the protein using experimentally derived kinetic parameters
(Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S10; ref. 30). The kinetic model (Fig. 1 and
submodels shown in Supplementary Data) was then fit to highresolution in vitro dynamic phosphoprotein expression generated
from RPPAs and normalized to total protein expression (Fig. 2A) as
well as supportive Western blot data (Supplementary Figs. S1, S12,
and S13). Time course data were generated from PE04 ovarian cancer
cell lines stimulated with heregulin-h in the presence or absence of
the HER2 dimerization inhibitor pertuzumab (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S12) to derive kinetic parameters, as described in
Supplementary Data—modeling methods and description of mathematical model. Additional time course profiles of BT474 breast
cancer cell lines were studied, but not used for parameterization of
the mathematical model, to establish qualitative similarities
between cell lines and the generality of the approach. Additional
model validation was provided by heregulin dose-response experi-

ments (Supplementary Fig. S13). The model satisfactorily reproduced the response kinetics of heterodimerization of HER2/HER3,
phospho-ERK (pERK), and pAKT activation stimulated by heregulinh and the inhibitory effect of pertuzumab (Supplementary Fig. S1).
A dominant signaling effect through PI3K with sustained steadystate changes in PI3K signaling in response to heregulin-h after 1
hour in multiple cell lines was observed (Fig. 2A).
The balance of the enzyme activities in the PI3K/PTEN cycle
dictates sensitivity and resistance to RTK inhibitor therapy. To
predict which pathway components most influence therapeutic
resistance to anti-HER2 therapy, we used the kinetic model to
interrogate which parameters most influenced downstream
pathway activation in response to endogenous ligand stimulation
and inhibition with dimerization inhibitors. Computational analysis of the model showed that HER2 receptor levels, total PTEN
levels, and activation of PI3K by mutation led to dimerization
inhibitor resistance measured by sustained AKT phosphorylation
after treatment with the dimerization inhibitor pertuzumab

ratio g of PTEN and PI3K* (g = PTEN/PI3K*; see Supplementary Data—modeling methods and description of mathematical model S3 for details). The index of
therapeutic resistance (R) was defined as follows: R80 = pAKT80/pAKT0, where pAKT80 is the value of pAKT signal when 80% of receptors are inhibited by the
drug and pAKT0 is the pAKT signal in the absence of RTK inhibitors. Thus, R reflects the nonresponsiveness (or resistance) of the pAKT signal to the inhibition of
receptors by RTK inhibitors. When R80 = 1, the resistance is the highest, meaning that 80% inhibition of RTK causes no inhibition of pAKT signal. High resistance is
observed on decreasing g three to five times in relation to go set in the model. C, predicted effect of PTEN loss on pAKT kinetics (left ) F pertuzumab and resulting

Figure 3. Quantitative PTEN protein expression is associated with pertuzumab sensitivity in vitro and trastuzumab resistance in vivo. A, relative sensitivity of 13
ovarian carcinoma cell lines to the HER2 dimerization inhibitor pertuzumab was determined by growth assay [sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay], and expression of
PTEN and other MAPK and PI3K pathway components was assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting. B, left, AQUA fluorescent analysis of PTEN expression in a

cutpoint for PTEN expression. X-tile calculates all possible combinations of results for different cutpoints (top ) and corresponding relative risks (bottom). Cutpoint
is selected on the best-corrected Monte-Carlo P value. Right, Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients treated with trastuzumab for low (blue ) and high (red)
protein expression of PTEN. Overall survival is calculated from time of initial diagnosis to date of death.

(Supplementary Fig. S15); however, because the activation of PI3K
required to induce resistance was supraphysiologic (10 required
to induce resistance in simulations versus 2 activation by
mutation as seen in vitro; ref. 31), and patients are always selected
based on high HER2 expression for RTK inhibitor therapy, we
focused on PTEN as potential resistance mechanisms to offer a
quantitative explanation for therapeutic resistance observed in vivo
(3). PTEN exists in a signaling cycle with PI3K such that the balance between the activities of PTEN and PI3K enzymes, PTEN:activated PI3K (integrated resistance factor g; Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Data—modeling methods and description of model S3), dictates
the sensitivity of AKT activation to ligand stimulation or inhibition.
High g results in effective inhibition of AKT activation in response
to pertuzumab, whereas low g predicts sustained AKT activation
and insensitivity to pertuzumab (Fig. 2B). Thus, we found that
the resistance to inhibition is strongly g dependent. At low g, the
system amplifies small signals from membrane receptors and
becomes insensitive to receptor inhibition. In Fig. 2B, this regimen
corresponds to high values of the therapeutic resistance index

R80(g). In the range of go (corresponding to the computational
results in Fig. 2A), signal transduction through PI3K/PTEN cycle is
sensitive to inhibition by pertuzumab (pAKT signal can be inhibited
by 30–70%). Further increase in g (>10 times higher than go) leads
to strong inhibition of pAKT signals due to significant weakening of the signal transduction through the PTEN/PI3K cycle
(see Supplementary Data—modeling methods and description
S3). Our results are in a good agreement with ultrasensitive
and signal-transducing regimens of signaling cascades described earlier for covalent modification (32, 33) and kinasephosphatase cycles (34).
Computational simulations are predictive of unseen experiments of therapeutic resistance caused by resistance factor ;.
We tested the effect of changing the PTEN:PI3K ratio by stimulating with heregulin-h after pretreating PE04 cell lines with
bpV(pic), a potent and specific inhibitor of PTEN, which acts by
binding to the active phosphatase CX5R motif (35, 36). The model
was entirely predictive of these unseen in vitro experiments, with
dynamics (compared by curve comparison and integration of

kinetic profiles) and steady-state levels of pAKT activation
matching computational simulations and abrogating inhibition of
pAKT with pertuzumab (Fig. 2C). Likewise, increasing the ratio of
PTEN:activated PI3K with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 resulted in
dose-dependent inhibition of pAKT, but not pERK, in PE04 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S14). This is also in agreement with our
theoretical results (see Supplementary Data—modeling methods
and description S3). Therefore, the model suggests that resistance
to RTK inhibitors is dependent on the quantitative balance of both
the protein expression of PTEN (which is common in breast cancer;
ref. 37) and PI3K activating mutations, which are commonly amplified and mutated in many breast and ovarian cancers (38, 39).
The resistance factor ; dictates resistance to pertuzumab in
cellular models in vitro. Further validation of the capacity of
measurement of PTEN:activated PI3K ratio to predict therapeutic
response was sought from cellular models of therapeutic sensitivity
and resistance. We measured total PTEN, PI3K mutation status of
the four most common mutations in the PIK3CA gene (H1047L and
H1047R in exon 20 and E545K and E542K in exon 9, representing
f90% of PIK3CA mutations), and PI3K amplification status in a
panel of 13 ovarian carcinoma cell lines to investigate the
association of PTEN:activated PI3K with response to pertuzumab
(Fig. 3A). Total PTEN protein expression levels were strongly
negatively correlated with both pAKT and percentage growth
inhibition with pertuzumab (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.68
and 0.74, respectively; Table 2). Two of the cell lines, SKOV3 and
OAW42, showed activating mutations in PI3K, but none of the cell
lines harbored PIK3CA amplifications. Activation by mutation was
assumed to increase the activity of PI3K 2-fold (31), and calculation
of PTEN:activated PI3K resulted in small increases in correlation
coefficients with pAKT and growth to 0.73 and 0.76, respectively,
suggesting that PTEN expression is the dominant factor in sensitivity to HER2 dimerization inhibition, consistent with recent
reports (40), and the relatively weak effect of 2 activity of PI3K on
resistance seen in simulations. However, measurement of HER1,
HER2, HER3, pAKT, or pERK was not highly correlated with sensitivity to pertuzumab (Table 2).
The quantitative expression of PTEN is associated to trastuzumab resistance in the clinic. Because both computational and
cellular modeling strongly suggest that quantitative PTEN protein

expression most influences ultimate cellular response to HER2
inhibition, we quantified expression of PTEN in 122 trastuzumabtreated primary breast tumors using the AQUA quantitative image
analysis system (Fig. 3B; Table 1) on primary breast tumors arrayed
on TMAs. Increasing PTEN expression was proportional to
decreased relative risk of death when treated with trastuzumab
(Fig. 3B, middle), mirroring the effect on the therapeutic resistance
index R80(g) by changes in g. A rigorously defined cutpoint for PTEN
expression (see Materials and Methods) resulted in a mean reduction
in overall survival of 21.6 months in PTENlow versus PTENhigh patients (uncorrected P = 0.0003, Miller-Siegmund P = 0.0099, MonteCarlo P = 0.01; Fig. 3B), equivalent to a 3.0 times increase in relative
risk of dying from breast cancer after treatment with trastuzumab
in PTENlow cases (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5;
P < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, tumor size, ER status, chemotherapy regimen, and PTEN expression levels were all associated
with significant survival differences (P < 0.05, log-rank test; Table 1),
but PTEN remained the only significant predictor of survival in
multivariate analysis (P = 0.01, Cox logistic regression) and corresponds well to the parameter g when PI3K expression level assumed
to be constant. HER2 expression and PIK3CA mutation status [mutations found in 26 of 119 (21.8%) available samples] were not
predictive of survival.

Discussion
Our data have shown the successful application of kinetic
modeling of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways in the selection
of resistance factors to RTK inhibitors. We have shown that PTEN is
the dominant resistance factor to RTK inhibition. As far as we are
aware, this is not only the largest series of breast cancers treated with
trastuzumab to be analyzed for PTEN to date but also the first to
show strong association of the level of PTEN expression with overall
survival rather than simply time to progression (3). Our data strongly
suggest that PI3K inhibition in PTEN-low tumors should be
combined with RTK inhibitors, as recently shown for lapatinib
in vitro (41). Similar to quantitative estrogen receptor positivity in
breast cancer (42), our data show that approximately a quarter of
HER2+ patients may be spared ineffective, and potentially toxic,
treatment if stratified by PTEN expression.
The PI3K pathway mediates key hallmarks of cancer, such as
growth, proliferation, survival, motility, and angiogenesis (43). PI3K
phosphorylates the lipid second messenger PI, which recruits AKT
and PDK1 to the cell membrane. PTEN is a key negative regulator of
the PI3K signaling pathway (29). PTEN mutations are responsible for
the hereditary disease Cowden disease, partial loss-of-function
mutations and loss of heterozygosity are common in the majority of
cancers, and loss of expression by techniques such as immunohistochemistry or Western blotting is frequently seen. Although recent
reports have suggested that PIK3CA mutations are important on a
PTEN mutant background (44), and PTEN expression may cooperate
with PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer and mediating trastuzumab
resistance (3, 40), our data show that PTEN exerts dominant control
in downstream pathway activation and resistance to RTK inhibitors.
PIK3CA mutations exert a relatively small influence on PTEN:PI3K
signaling cycle and resistance and would have to have a 5- to 10-fold
increase in enzymatic activity to mediate resistance, which may
explain the lack of effect of PIK3CA mutation on trastuzumab
resistance seen herein. Previous reports implicating PIK3CA
mutations in HER2 inhibitor resistance have only been in vitro or
are very small cohorts of patients (3, 4). Other RTK inhibitors, such as

pertuzumab, have also been shown to inhibit PI3K pathway
activation (45, 46), suggesting that constitutive activation of this
pathway through PTEN down-regulation may also contribute to
pertuzumab resistance in vitro and in vivo. Given the quantitative
nature of these phenomena, a mathematical description and systems
analysis of the PI3K pathway has been useful for understanding
therapeutic responses and allows better selection of patients
expected to respond to RTK inhibitors.
In this study, we have successfully shown how a systems biology
approach can generate hypotheses that can be tested experimentally
in preclinical models and which can then be applied to clinical
evaluation. Predictions from this model are consistent with known
findings, have been extended within this study, and add weight to the
use of PTEN as a biomarker for stratifying patients for HER2 inhibitor
or combinatorial therapy, particularly a RTK inhibitor and PI3K
inhibitor in cancers with low g. This model provides a foundation for
further development and inclusion of more variables that may affect
RTK inhibitor response. Network topology, kinetics, and quantities of

molecules dictate cellular and ultimately clinical outcome. Systems
biology approaches, particularly deterministic kinetic models based
on experimental data, offer a new approach for integrating molecular
pathology and computational modeling to more rationally interrogate
cancer pathways and predict responses to therapy.
