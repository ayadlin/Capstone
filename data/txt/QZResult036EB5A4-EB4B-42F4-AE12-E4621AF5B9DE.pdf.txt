ABSTRACT
Previous studies indicate that BRCA1 protein binds to estrogen receptor-alpha
(ER) and inhibits its activity. Here, we found that BRCA1 over-expression not only
inhibits ER activity in anti-estrogen-resistant LCC9 cells but also partially restores their
sensitivity to Tamoxifen. To simulate the mechanism of BRCA1 inhibition of ER in the
setting of Tamoxifen resistance, we created a three-dimensional model of a BRCA1binding cavity within the ER/Tamoxifen complex; and we screened a pharmacophore
database to identify small molecules that could fit into this cavity. Among the top 40
“hits”, six exhibited potent ER inhibitory activity in anti-estrogen-sensitive MCF-7
cells and four of the six exhibited similar activity (IC50 ≤ 1.0 μM) in LCC9 cells. We
validated the model by mutation analysis. Two representative compounds (4631-P/1
and 35466-L/1) inhibited ER-dependent cell proliferation in Tamoxifen-resistant cells
(LCC9 and LCC2) and partially restored sensitivity to Tamoxifen. The compounds also
disrupted the association of BRCA1 with ER. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
the compounds caused dissociation of ER from a model estrogen response element.
Finally, a modified form of compound 35446 (hydrochloride salt) inhibited growth
of LCC9 tumor xenografts at non-toxic concentrations. These results identify a novel
group of small molecules that can overcome Tamoxifen resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Mutations of BRCA1 account for half of all
hereditary breast cancers [2]; and in 30-40% of sporadic
cancers, BRCA1 expression is absent or reduced,
suggesting a wider role in breast cancer [3-6]. While
many studies on BRCA1 have focused on its roles in
maintenance of genomic integrity [7, 8], BRCA1 also
functions to regulate ER activity. Thus, a mammarytargeted Brca1 deficiency confers hypersensitivity to
estrogen and promotes the development of mammary
pre-neoplasia and cancer in mice [9]. In cultured cells,
BRCA1-siRNA causes estrogen-independent ER
activation and stimulates the agonist activity of Tam; and
in Brca1-deficient mice, Tam promotes mammary cancer
development [10, 11]. Finally, BRCA1-knockdown causes
Tam-resistance due to altered recruitment of co-regulators

At presentation, about 70% of breast cancers are
estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and thus suitable for antiestrogen therapy [1]. Despite being ER+, 50% of patients
with advanced breast cancer who receive anti-estrogen
treatment with Tamoxifen (Tam) fail to respond; and all
patients with metastatic breast cancer eventually develop
Tam resistance. In addition, many patients (about 40%)
who receive Tam as adjuvant therapy will relapse and die
of disease [1]. The causes of resistance to different antiestrogens are not identical, but cross-resistance is common
[1]. In most cases of acquired anti-estrogen resistance,
breast cancers retain ER and may be amenable to novel
approaches to target ER.

by ER [12].
Based on studies of the BRCA1: ER interaction, we
identified small molecules that recapitulate the mode in
which a portion of BRCA1 inserts into ER and inhibits its
activity. We identified two distinct non-overlapping sets
of compounds, one based on ER ligated to 17β-estradiol
(E2) [13] and the other based on ER bound to 4OH-Tam.
This manuscript focuses on the latter compounds that bind
to the ER/Tam complex. These compounds do not bind to
the ligand-binding pocket and thus work differently from
conventional anti-estrogens such as Tam and Fulvestrant.
Here we report on initial characterization of the activity of
these compounds.

suppressed E2-stimulated ER activity in MCF-7 cells.
When MCF-7 cells were tested in the absence of E2, ER
activity was very low under most conditions (illustrating
the requirement for E2 to activate ER); but without E2,
Tam functioned as an ER agonist and caused a (5-6)-fold
increase in ER activity (P < 0.001). Thus, BRCA1 inhibits
ER activity in LCC9 cells and partially restores sensitivity
to Tam.

New set of BRCA1-related ER antagonists
An original set of compounds were designed to
mimic a portion of BRCA1 in complex with E2-bound
ER [13]. We reasoned that since the conformation of ER
bound to Tam differs from that of E2-bound ER [14], a
screening of compounds based on the Tam-bound ER
might identify compounds whose binding to ER would
synergize with Tam and help re-sensitize resistant breast
cancers to Tam. We expected that the chemical structures
of new compounds that bind to the BRCA1 cavity on the
Tam-bound ER would differ from the original compounds
as the shape and characteristics of the putative BRCA1binding cavities are distinct.

RESULTS
BRCA1 over-expression partially restores Tam
sensitivity to anti-estrogen-resistant LCC9 cells
We compared the effect of BRCA1 over-expression
(by transfection of wild-type (wt) BRCA1 vector) in LCC9
human breast cancer cells with anti-estrogen sensitive
MCF-7 cells. wtBRCA1 suppressed the constitutive ER
activity (measured using ERE-TK-Luc reporter), but Tam
(5 µM) alone had no effect (Figure 1A and 1B (left)). The
combination of wtBRCA1+Tam gave greater suppression
of ER activity than wtBRCA1 alone (P < 0.001). In
contrast to LCC9, wtBRCA1 and Tam each strongly

Figure 1: Inhibition of ER activity in LCC9 and MCF-7 cells by BRCA1. LCC9 or MCF-7 cells in 24-well dishes were

co-transfected overnight with the ERE-TK-Luc reporter plasmid and wild-type (wt) BRCA1 or empty pcDNA3 vector (0.25 µg of each
plasmid per well), washed, and allowed to recover for several hours in fresh culture medium (DMEM plus 5% charcoal-stripped serum).
The cells were then treated ± 17β-estradiol (E2, 10 nM) and ± Tamoxifen (5 µM), as indicated for 24-hr, after which the cells were harvested
for luciferase assays. For MCF-7, luciferase activity is expressed as a fold-change relative to the no E2 control. For LCC9, luciferase
activity is expressed relative to the control without the reporter present. Values plotted are means ± SEMs of four replicate wells. The data
shown in each panel are representative of three independent experiments.

with 4OHTam, we set up an in silico screening of small
molecule libraries. Based on our successful previous
screening [13], we defined the small drug-like molecule
binding site that is close to the BRCA1-binding interface
and the E2-binding pocket. This site is essentially the
same location on ER as the previously described site, but
it is altered due to the OHTam binding to ER. Of note is
the relative location of these two sites, which form two
separate pockets, but because of their physical proximity
and the fact that the BRCA1 pocket site is defined in the
presence of 4OHTam, the binding of a small molecule
at the BRCA1 site and that of 4OHTam are expected to
synergistically influence their binding properties and
mimic BRCA1 suppression of ER. We conducted a
virtual screening against the BRCA1 pocket site using the
National Cancer Institute/Developmental Therapeutics

Program “Diversity Set”. This screening yielded the 40
top ranked compounds (selection criteria are described
in the Methods section), Even though we screened the
same database of 1,990 compounds in the same manner
as before, there was no overlap between the new set of the
top 40 compounds identified based on the ER/4OHTam
structure and the original set of the top 40 compounds
based on the ER/E2 structure.

Screening of compounds for inhibition of ER
activity
We obtained 36 of the top 40 “hit” compounds from
the NCI and tested them for inhibition of E2-stimulated ER
activity in MCF-7 cells. Six of the 36 compounds (4631-

washed, and allowed to recover for several hours in fresh culture medium. The cells were then treated ± 17β-estradiol (E2, 10 nM) and with
the indicated compound (@ 1 µM or 20 µM) or vehicle only (DMSO) for 24 hr and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity is

372127-T/1) gave ≥ 50% inhibition at 1 μM, indicating
IC50 values ≤ 1 μM (Figure 2). All six compounds gave >
80% inhibition at 20 μM. The remaining 30 compounds
had no inhibitory activity or had IC50 values ≥ 20 μM. A
complete dose-response curve is shown for one compound
(35466-L/1) (Figure 2H). This curve shows a continuous
reduction of ER activity as the concentration of compound
35446-L/1 is increased from 0.01 to 50 μM, with an IC50
of 0.8 μM. It is unlikely that the ER inhibition is due to
non-specific cytotoxicity, since cell viability ranged from

85-100% after a 24-hr exposure to 1 μM of each of the
compounds; and for four of the six compounds (4631P/1, 35446-L/1, 48693-K/1, and 81747-K/1), cell viability
was 100% at a 1 μM concentration and over 90% at 20
μM (Figure 3A-3B). We tested each of the six active
compounds for its ability to inhibit progestin-stimulated
progesterone receptor (PR) activity in a PR+ breast cancer
cell line (T47D), using the MMTV-Luc reporter. There
was little or no inhibition of PR activity by any of the
compounds (Figure 3C-3D), suggesting that ER inhibition
is selective.

these dose-response data, IC50 values for each compound and each different ER mutation were
calculated. Amino acid residues predicted to interact with compound A7 in the ER/E2 complex or
with compound 35446 in the ER/Tam complex are shown in Fig. 2B and 2C, respectively.

Structural characteristics of interaction of
compounds with ER

of residues predicted to interact with 35466 conferred
significant increases in IC50 for ER inhibition by 35446
compared to wild-type ER; while mutations of residues
predicted to interact with A7 conferred large increases
in the IC50 values for A7 compared to wtER (Table 1).
Conversely, mutations of residues not predicted to interact
directly with either 35446 or A7 did not alter the ability of
the respective compound to inhibit ER activity. Finally,
mutations of residues predicted to contact one compound
but not the other significantly increased the IC50’s for that
compound but not the other. These findings are illustrated
for compound 35446 utilizing mutations of residues
predicted to contact 35446 (Figure 4D-4E) and residues
predicted not to contact 35446 (Figure 4E-4G). Chemical
diagrams of our six new compounds, Tam, and older
generation compound A7 are shown in Figure 5.

While differences in the interaction of the new
compounds with ER/4OHTam vs the original compounds
with ER/E2 are not large, they are significant. The
binding cavity for the new compounds is narrower than
for the original compounds; and the surface electrostatic
potentials are different. The binding site for new
compounds is sandwiched between the co-activator
binding site and Tam binding site and is very close to the
Tam molecule (Figure 4A). Thus, it is sensitive to what is
bound at those sites and may affect the conformation at the
co-activator binding site and AF-2 helix. Some residues
on ER predicted to interact with the original compounds
(Figure 4B) are different from those predicted to interact
with the new compounds (Figure 4C). For example, Ile386
and Leu387 are predicted to be physically close (≤ 3 Å) to
each of four active new compounds bound but not for any
of four active original compounds; while Glu323 interacts
with original compound A7 but not new compound 48693K/1.
To test the computational models in Figure 4B4C, we created point mutations of each residue within
ER predicted to contact the compounds and compared
the ability of first generation compound A7 and second
generation compound 35466 to inhibit the mutant ER and
wtER expressed in ER- MDA-MB-231 cells. Mutations

Inhibition of ER activity in LCC9 cells
LCC9, which was originally derived from MCF-7,
is an estrogen-insensitive cell line with a constitutively
active ER that exhibits ER-dependent but E2-independent
cell proliferation [15, 16]. We tested the concentration
dependence of each bioactive compound for inhibition
of ER activity in LCC9 (Figure 6). Four of the six
compounds (4631-P/1, 35446-L/1, 88999-U/1, and
372127-T/1) showed IC50’s similar to those observed in
MCF-7 (≤ 1 µM). The remaining compounds (48693-K/1

We tested two compounds for their effects on

(which is E2-insensitive and resistant to Tam and
Fulvestrant) and LCC2 (which is E2-independent and
resistant to Tam, but not Fulvestrant). Neither E2 nor
Tam significantly altered growth of LCC9 in DMEM
supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum (Figure

growth, consistent with its ability to inhibit ER activity
in these cells. A combination of Tam (1 μM) and 4631-

Because these compounds were selected to occupy
a BRCA1-binding pocket in ER, the compounds should
be able to disrupt the BRCA1/ER complex. We tested
the ability of 4631-P/1 to dissociate the BRCA1: ER
complex by immunoprecipitation-Western blotting. At 0,
1, and 20 μM, 4631-P/1 caused concentration-dependent
dissociation of ER and BRCA1; while a control IP failed
to precipitate BRCA1 or ER (Figure 7A-7B). Compound
4631-P/1 had no effect on total levels of ER or BRCA1, as

P/1 (1 μM) gave greater inhibition of cell proliferation
than 4631-P/1 alone. The growth inhibitory effect of
addition of Tam to 4631-P/1 was more obvious when the
concentration of 4631-P/1 was reduced to 0.5 μM (Figure
8B). Similar results were observed in LCC2 (Figure 8C8D). [Note that while LCC2 exhibits E2-independent
growth, E2 can cause a slight stimulation of growth.] As
for 4631-P/1, 35466-L/1 plus Tam gave greater inhibition
of LCC9 proliferation than did 35466-L/1 alone (Figure
8E). Figure 8F shows that LCC9 proliferation is ERdependent. Knockdown of ER significantly inhibited
cell proliferation. In ER-siRNA-treated cells, addition of
35466-L/1 had little effect on cell proliferation, consistent
with the idea that this compound acts via ER. The efficacy
of the ER knockdown is shown in Figure 8G. The residual
proliferation of ER-siRNA-treated LCC9 cells could be
due to some ER-independent growth or incomplete ER
knockdown. These data suggest that our compounds

inhibit growth of Tam-resistant cells and may partially
restore sensitivity to Tam.

4631-P/1 and 35446-L/1 disrupt interaction of ER
with the ERE
We used electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSAs) of MCF-7 cells to test the effects of our
compounds on binding of ER to a consensus ERE.
Pre-treatment with E2 caused appearance of a band
corresponding to ER bound to a labeled (“hot”) ERE
oligonucleotide; and incubation with an excess of
unlabeled (“cold”) ERE caused the band to disappear
(Figure 9A). Pre-incubation of cells with 4631-P/1 (1
or 20 µM) caused a dose-dependent reduction of the
ER/ERE complex. Addition of anti-ER antibody caused
“supershift” of the ER/ERE band, confirming the presence

EMSAs in which compound was not present during
pre-incubation of cells with E2 but was added directly
to the nuclear extracts; and Figure 9E-9F show the
corresponding supershift assays. These studies showed a
greater effect when 4631-P/1 or 35446-L/ (1-5 µM) was
added directly to nuclear extracts, suggesting that the
plasma and/or nuclear membrane may present a barrier to
compound entry.

alone had little or no effect on cathepsin D levels, but they
blocked E2-stimulated expression of cathepsin D. LCC9
cells expressed cathepsin D constitutively, and the high
levels of cathepsin D were decreased by a 24-hr exposure
to either compound (Figure 10B, 10D).

4631-P/1 and 35466-L/1 inhibit expression of an
ER-regulated gene

Consistent with growth experiments, 4631-P/1
inhibited ER activity in LCC9 cells, while Tam alone had
no effect (Figure 11). However, the combination of 4631P/1 plus Tam gave significantly lower ER activity than
4631-P/1 alone (P < 0.001). In contrast, a combination
of Tam plus older generation compound A7 gave no more
inhibition of ER activity than A7 alone.

activity but was less efficient at inhibiting ER-β than ERα.

ER-β (also known as ESR2) is a homolog of ER-α
(also known as ER or estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)) with
an overlapping but non-identical tissue distribution. Like
ER-α, it is transactivated by E2 and binds to the canonical
ERE; and ER-β can bind directly to ER-α and modulate
its activity. Here, we compared the ability of compound
35446 to inhibit E2-stimulated ER-β activity vs ER-α
activity using the ERE-luciferase reporter. Experiments

Figure 12: Compound 35446 inhibits the activity of ER-β. Subconfluent proliferating DU-145 cells in 24-well dishes were

transfected overnight with the ER=α or ER=β expression vector plus the ERE-TK-Luc reporter plasmid (0.25 µg per plasmid/well), washed,
and allowed to recover for several hours in fresh culture medium. The cells were then post-incubated for 24 hr to allow gene expression,
after which they were treated ± E2 (10 nM) and ± compound 35446 (20 μM) (or compound B2 as a negative control) for 24 hr and assayed
for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity is expressed relative to the no E2 control. Values are means ± SEMs of four replicate wells. The
data shown in each panel are representative of three independent experiments.

Tumor xenograft experiments

a high resolution study of the BRCA1: ER interaction,
we proposed a three-dimensional model of a partial
BRCA1: ER complex in which the interaction occurred
over a broad area [18]. However, we were able to identify
a potential BRCA1-binding cavity that is narrow enough
and deep enough to accommodate a small molecule with a
relatively tight fit. Evidence that these compounds inhibit
ER activity in a manner related to BRCA1 comes from
the finding that one compound (4631-P/1) disrupted the
BRCA1:ER association in cultured cells.
Two classes of ER antagonists, SERMs (selective
ER modulators) and SERDs (selective ER degraders) are
currently used for treatment of ER+ breast cancer and/or
in breast cancer prevention; and additional SERMs are
currently under development [19-21]. SERMs currently in
use include Tam, Toremifene, Clomifene and Raloxifene.
All SERMs as well as Fulvestrant (a SERD) bind to the
LBP of ER. Since our compounds do not bind to the
LBP, their mechanism of action differs from SERMs and
SERDs. Evidence that our compounds work differently
comes from their ability to inhibit ER activity and cell
proliferation in LCC9, a cell line that is resistant to Tam
and Fulvestrant and LCC2, a cell line resistant to Tam, but
not Fulvestrant [15, 16]. A modified form of compound
35446 (hydrochloride salt) inhibited the growth of
LCC9 tumor xenografts at doses (10 and 20 mg/kg every
other day) that yielded no acute toxicity, suggesting the
compound can be administered safely and effectively.
Many different mechanisms for anti-estrogen
resistance have been identified [1, 22]. Some of these (eg.,
loss of ER expression due to promoter hypermethylation
or other mechanisms) are not amenable to treatment with
any ER antagonist. Sensitivity of anti-estrogen-resistant
breast cancer cells to our compounds requires that tumor
cells retain ER protein and remain dependent upon ER
for proliferation and/or survival. As we have tested these
compounds in a small number of anti-estrogen-resistant
cell types, it is unclear if the compounds will inhibit all
ER+ tumor cells that are resistant to conventional anti-

For these studies we used LCC9 cells grown as
subcutaneous tumors in Balb/c nude mice. To improve
water solubility, the compound tested (NSC 35446) was
prepared as the hydrochloride salt, as described in the
Methods section. The mice were dosed intraperitoneally
with vehicle (control) or NSC 35446 hydrochloride every
other day at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg. Treatments were initiated
when the tumors reached 150-200 mm3. No significant
changes in body weight or obvious signs of acute toxicity
such as the loss of appetite, decreased activity, or lethargy
were observed during the 21-day study interval. The
compound appeared to be efficacious at the 10 mg/kg and
20 mg/kg doses in slowing tumor growth or causing tumor
stasis (Figure 13). For most time points except the earliest,
differences in size between the treated and control tumors
were significant (P < 0.05, ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple
comparison test). There appeared to be some delay in
tumor growth at the 5 mg/kg dose; but by day 21, the
treated tumors were approaching the control tumors in
size. The T/C ratios (ie., ratios of the changes in volume of
treated tumors to that of control tumors) on day-21 were:
0.77 (5 mg/kg), 0.24 (10 mg/kg), and 0.15 (20 mg/kg).
These findings suggest dose-dependent inhibition of LCC9
tumor growth by NSC 35446 hydrochloride.

DISCUSSION
We described and partially characterized a novel
group of small molecule compounds that act as ER
antagonists by binding to a putative BRCA1-binding
cavity that is distinct from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP)
and the coactivator-binding pocket in ER. Development
of small molecule compounds that inhibit or mimic the
binding interaction of two proteins is problematic because
protein:protein interactions often occur over broad smooth
surfaces that are not amenable to to small molecules. In

estrogens or only a subset of these tumor cells.
So far, we have not observed any ER agonist activity
for these compounds. SERMs like Tam can have both
agonist or antagonist activity in different contexts and
in different tissues and organs. Thus, while Tam inhibits
E2-stimulated ER activity in MCF-7 cells, it stimulates
ER activity in MCF-7 cells in the absence of E2 [10,
13]. Tam agonist activity can be beneficial (eg., in bone,
where Tam acts like E2 to increase bone density) or
problematic (eg., in the uterus, where long-term use can
cause uterine hyperplasia and cancer) [23-25]. It remains
to be determined how our compounds affect ER activity
in the other ER+ tissues. Despite their general similarity,
different SERMs have different tissue-specific activity
profiles. For example, Tam and Raloxifene inhibit ER
activity in the breast but Raloxifene, unlike Tamoxifen,
does not act as an agonist in the uterus. Both agents act
as agonists in bone, and both have similar effects in the
cardiovascular system, where they increase the risk of
thromboembolism [26, 27].
It is not surprising that our compounds inhibit ER
activity in Tam-resistant cells because they differ from
Tam in mode of interaction with ER. But it was surprising
that these compounds partially restore Tam sensitivity in
LCC9 and LCC2 cells. This is consistent with a model
in which binding of a compound to the ER/Tam complex
cells alters the conformation of ER so that it is resensitized to Tam. Alternatively, if the ER in LCC9 cells
is configured so that it does not bind Tam, ligation to a
compound might alter the ER conformation so that it can
bind Tam.
A somewhat surprising finding was the observation
that our compounds disrupted the interaction between ER
and an ERE oligonucleotide in EMSAs and supershift
assays using MCF-7 nuclear lysates. Similar results were
obtained for LCC9 anti-estrogen resistant cells (data
not shown). These findings suggest that our compounds
may stabilize ER in a conformation that is unsuitable
for binding to DNA. However, it is cautioned that the
effect of the compounds on the ER: ERE interaction may
not be direct, since these experiments were carried out
using nuclear lysates and not under cell-free conditions.
These findings suggest that our compounds, which were
not designed to target the DNA binding domain of ER
may cause a conformational change that results in the
disruption of the ER: ERE interaction, just as E2 can cause
a profound conformation change in ER by binding to the
ligand-binding pocket (LBP).
Our ER mutation analyses indicate that original
(first) and new (second) generation compounds exhibit
distinct patterns of inhibition of ER activity. Thus,
mutation of any of the residues unique for the BRCA1
mimetic pocket of first generation compounds blocked
ER inhibitory activity of first generation but not second
generation compounds; and conversely, mutation of any
of the residues unique for the BRCA1 mimetic pocket of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

second generation compounds block the ER inhibitory
activity of second generation but not first generation
compounds. The differences in structure between the
two pockets may be the related to why only the second
generation compounds synergize with Tam in Tamresistant LCC9 and LCC2 cells, but exactly how and why
this is the case must await detailed structural biologic
studies. In this regard, I386 and L387 may be important
for the synergy with Tam of second generation compounds
(see Figure 1C).
Caboni and Lloyd [28] have reviewed the targeting
of sites in nuclear receptors other than the LBP. Most of
the small molecule inhibitors that target non-LBP sites in
both ER and other nuclear receptors in that review target
the coactivator binding site, although some targeted the
DNA-binding domain or other sites Most also work at
significantly higher concentrations than do our compounds
(IC50 about 0.8 μM for our compounds). Our binding site
is distinct from the LBP and the coactivator binding site,
but it is close enough to either site that it may allosterically
influence these sites.
Both ER knockdown with RNAi [35] and the ER
antagonists induce growth inhibition, implying that some
functions within LCC9 cells remain dependent upon
constitutive ER action. Other components of the cell fate
machinery in these cells are likely to act independent of
ER function. The complexity of signaling in endocrine
resistance has been reviewed extensively and likely
includes both ER-dependent and ER-independent
signaling to regulate the balance between prodeath
apoptosis and prosurvival autophagy [36].
Finally, we tested the ability of compound 35446
to inhibit ER-β activity and found that it significantly
inhibited ER-β activity when ER-β was transfected into
ER- cells; but the inhibition was less than that of ER-α
transfected into the same cell type. These findings are
consistent with the high degree of homology between the
ligand binding domains of ER-β and ER-α, as well as the
near identity of the DNA-binding domain of these two
receptors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
MCF-7, LCC9, LCC2, DU-145, and MDA-MB-231
cells were obtained from the Lombardi Comprehensive
Cancer Center Tissue Culture Shared Resource and
cultured as described earlier [13, 15, 16, 18, 29].

Reagents
17β-estradiol (E2), and Tam, and 4OH-Tam were
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and R5020 was

Oncotarget

purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham,
MA) These agents were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) and
added to culture medium at the time of assays. MTT dye
((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) was obtained from Sigma. The compounds
screened in bioassays were obtained from the NCI/ DTP
Open Chemical Repository through the DTP website:
http://dtp.cancer.gov in powder form.

Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies, Washington, DC).
Total transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of
control vector. The cells were washed, incubated in phenol
red-free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum
(obtained from the Tissue Culture Shared Resource) (0.2
ml/well) ± E2 (10 nM) ± the indicated compound for 24hr, and harvested for luciferase assays. For each assay
condition was tested in quadrupicate. To monitor the
transfection efficiency, cultures were co-transfected with
plasmid pRSV-β-gal (Promega, Madison, WI) to visualize
transfected cells by X-gal staining.
To determine the effect of compound on ER-β
activity, an ER- β expression plasmid (cat. no.: 35562,
Addgene, Cambridge) was co-transfected into ER- DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells along with the ERETK-Luc reporter plasmid (0.25 μg of each plasmid)
and the cells were incubated overnight to allow gene
expression. The cells were then treated ± E2 (10 nM) and
± the indicated compound for 24-hr, and harvested for
luciferase assays as above.

Generation of NSC 35446 hydrochloride salt
A solution of free base 1,3-diphenyl-3-(piperidin1-yl)propan-1-one (NSC 35446) (2 g, 6.8 mmol) in
anhydrous diethyl ether (100 ml) was placed to stir on
iced-water bath. After complete compound dissolution,
a solution of HCl (concentrated) in ether (1:9 v/v) was
added in a dropwise manner until complete precipitation
of the salt (pH 4). The solid was separated by filtration and
washed with diethyl ether (3 x 25 ml) to remove excess
acid. The product was recrystallized from ethanol and airdried at 25oC to yield 1.2 g (53%) of compound as a white
crystalline salt.

PR assays were carried out in T47D cells using the
synthetic progestin R5020 (10 nM) to activate PR and
the MMTV-Luc reporter as a readout for PR activity, as
described before [32].

Wild-type BRCA1 expression vector was created by
cloning full-length BRCA1 cDNA into the pcDNA3 vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [30]. The reporter ERE-TKLuc is composed of the vitellogenin A2 enhancer (ERE)
controlling a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (TK81)
and luciferase in plasmid pGL2 [31]. The progesteroneresponsive reporter MMTV-Luc was described earlier
[32]. The mutant ER expression vectors were created by
site directed mutagenesis of ER cDNA in the pCMV-ER
vector.

MTT assays of cell viability
Assays were performed as described before [30].
After the indicated treatment, cells in 96-well dishes were
solubilized and assayed for MTT dye reduction. Cell
viability was expressed as the amount of dye reduction
relative to untreated control cells. and calculated as means
± SEMs for 10 replicate wells.

Cell proliferation assays

siRNAs used herein were as follows: ER-siRNA:
Sense 5’-CAGGCACAUGAGUA ACAAATT-3’ and
antisense
5’-UUUGUUACUCAUGUGCCUGAT-3’
(Ambion/Life Technol-ogies, Washington, DC); and
negative control-siRNA (AM4461, Ambion). Subconfluent
proliferating cells were treated with ER- or control-siRNA
(100 nM) using siPORT Amine transfection reagent
(Ambion). Western blotting revealed that a minimum of
48-hr exposure to 100 nM of ER-siRNA was required to
obtain >75% reduction of ER.

Assays were performed using as the growth medium
phenol red-free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped
serum. Briefly, proliferating cells were harvested using
trypsin, counted, inoculated into 12-well dishes at 1 x 104
cells per well on day 0 and allowed to attach and recover
for 24 hr. The cells were then treated with the indicated
agents for up to five days, with daily refeeding with
fresh medium and agents. Triplicate wells were counted
by Coulter Counter on days 1, 3, and 5. For experiments
using siRNAs, cells were treated with the indicated siRNA
(100 nM) starting on day -2, and fresh siRNA was added
on days 0, 2, and 4.

Assays of ER activity

Western blotting

Double-stranded
oligonucleotides
containing a consensus ERE were obtained
from
Santa

(sc-2858).
Sequences of the oligonucleotides were: sense
5’-GGATCTAGGTCACTGTGACCCCGGATC-3’
and
antisense:
3’-CCTAGATC
CAGTGACACTGGGGCCTAG-5’. Oligonucleotides
were 3’-end-labeled using a Biotin Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL). DNA binding reactions were carried out
using nuclear extracts of MCF-7 cells that were treated
± E2 (10 nM) and ± the indicated compound for 24-hr.
Treated cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were
prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific). Aliquots of
nuclear extract protein (2 µg) were incubated with gel-shift
binding buffer (LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit,
Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at 25oC. After incubation,
40 fmol of biotin-labeled ERE-containing oligonucleotides
were added, and the mixture was re-incubated for 30 min
at 25oC. Reaction products were loaded electrophoresed
on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) and transferred
onto a nylon membrane. Biotin-labeled DNA was detected
using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection
Module (Thermo Scientific). To test the specificity
of binding, a 40-fold excess of unlabeled (“cold”)
oligonucleotide was added to one of the reactions along
with the biotin-labeled (“hot”) oligonucleotide. Note:
In some experiments, the compound was added to the
reaction mixture after the nuclear extract was prepared.
Supershift assays were performed as above, except that
before addition of the hot ERE oligonucleotide, nuclear
extracts were incubated with 2-μg of anti-ER IgG (rabbit
polyclonal, HC-20, Santa Cruz) for 30 min at 25oC.

After the indicated cell treatment(s), the cells
were harvested, and whole-cell lysates were prepared
using RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz) [11, 18]. Equal aliquots
of whole-cell protein (either 100 μg unprecipitated
whole-cell lysate or one half of the precipitated protein
from 500-μg whole-cell lysate) were electrophoresed on
4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and
blotted using primary antibodies against BRCA1 (C-20,
rabbit polyclonal, 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz), cathepsin
D (R-20, goat polyclonal, 1:300; Santa Cruz), ER (F10,
mouse monoclonal, 1:500; Santa Cruz), or actin (goat
polyclonal, sc-1615, 1:400; Santa Cruz). The membranes
were blotted with the appropriate secondary antibodies
(1:1000; Santa Cruz), and the blotted proteins were
visualized using an electrochemiluminescence detection
system (Amersham Biosciences), with colored markers
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) as molecular size
standards.

In silico screening of small molecules
Similarly to the previous screening strategy to
identify “BRCA1-mimetic” compounds based on ER
bound with E2 [13], an in silico screening with AutoDock
(ver. 4, The Scripps Research Institute; [33]) and
AutoDockTools (ADT) was set up based on the model
structure of the BRCA1-binding interface of the ER LBD
in complex with OHT (4-hydroxytamoxifen) (PDB: 2ERT)
[34]. The BRCA1 binding pocket is equivalent to the one
on ER in complex with E2, but the new site is redefined
for ER in complex with OHT. The virtual screening
library was the NCI/DTP “Diversity Set” (about 1,990
compounds), selected from over 140,000 compounds
available for distribution from the DTP repository (http:
//dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/dscb/repo_open.html). The
selection of the diversity set is based on diversity of
pharmacophores, chemical structure, pharmacologically
desirable features, and availability and purity of the
compounds. In general, the default parameters were
used for AutoDock docking and the docking results were
ranked based on their binding energies, clustering of their
10 lowest energy binding conformations, and interactions
with ER, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
interactions with visual inspections.

Immunoprecipitation (IP)
After the indicated treatments, cells were harvested,
and whole cell extracts were prepared in IP buffer [10
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630
(Sigma), 10% glycerol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz)] [11, 18]. Each IP
was carried out using 2-μg antibody and 500-μg extract
protein. The extracts were incubated anti-ER antibody
H184 (sc-7207, rabbit polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz) or
with a combination of anti-BRCA1 mouse monoclonals
(Ab-1+Ab-2+Ab-3, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA); and
the precipitated proteins were collected using protein A/G
agarose (Santa Cruz). After low-speed centrifugation to
remove the supernatant, the agarose was washed with
PBS, collected in boiling sample buffer (Santa Cruz), and
subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For each
experiment, a control IP using an equal quantity of normal

microisolater tops and provided food (Furina mice chow)
and water ad libitum. The light cycle was regulated
automatically (12 hours light/dark cycle) and temperature
23±1ºC. Animals were allowed to acclimate to this
environment for one week prior to usage. The Georgetown
University Animal Care and Use Committee approved
all animal studies in accordance with NIH guidelines.
The stock solution of NSC 35446 hydrochloride was
dissolved in DMSO at 200 mg/ml. The working solution
was prepared using 10% Kolliphor ELP (Sigma-Aldrich),
3% PEG400 (Hampton Research, HR2-603); and 87%
PBS to give a 1 mg/ml solution. Female Balb/c nude
mice (18-22g) were injected with LCC9 cells (3 X 106
cells in a volume of 0.3 ml) in the subcutaneous tissue of
the right axillary region. The mice were randomly sorted
into groups with N=5 mice per group; and treatments were
initiated when the tumors reached 150-200 mm3. The
tumor-bearing mice were given intraperitoneal injections
of vehicle only (control), 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/
kg of NSC 35446 hydrochloride every other day. The
tumor size of each mouse was measured by caliper and
calculated by the formula: length x width x width/2 and
the body weight was recorded.
