Abstract
The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
are effective immune modulators and cytotoxic agents
extensively used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases,
graft rejection, and cancer. There is compelling epidemiologic
evidence that thiopurine treatment increases the risk for a
variety of tumors by mechanisms that are unclear. We
investigated the in vivo mutagenicity of long-term thiopurine
treatment by determining the frequency and spectra of
somatic mutation events at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in peripheral T lymphocytes as well
as the prevalence of mutant clonal proliferation in a crosssectional analysis of data from 119 children and adults with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ANOVA and regression
were performed to assess relationships among the frequency
and spectra of HPRT mutations with disease, duration of
illness, duration of treatment, and total therapeutic dose of
azathioprine and 6-MP. We observed a significant increase in
the frequency of somatic mutations in 56 subjects treated with
thiopurines for IBD compared with 63 subjects not treated
with thiopurines. This increase was related to both total dose
(P < 0.001) and duration of treatment (P < 0.001). Comparative
mutation spectra analysis of 1,020 mutant isolates revealed a
significant increase in the proportion of all transitions (P <
0.001), particularly G:C to A:T transitions (P < 0.001).
Combined analyses of two signatures for mutant clonality,
HPRT mutation, and T-cell receptor B CDR3 region unique
gene sequence also showed a significant thiopurine-dependent
increase in mutant cell clonal proliferation (P < 0.001). These
findings provide in vivo evidence for mutation induction as a
potential carcinogenic mechanism associated with chronic
thiopurine intervention. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):7004–12]

Introduction
Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are effective immune modulators and cytotoxic agents used extensively for the
treatment of autoimmune diseases (1), transplant graft rejection
(2), and cancer (3). Their pharmacologic effects are complex and
involve both inhibition of purine biosynthesis and incorporation of
2-deoxy-6-thioguanine nucleotides into DNA (4, 5). Cytotoxicity
following thiopurine incorporation into DNA seems to require
methylation of the thiol group, mispairing of S-methylthioguanine

with thymine, with subsequent recognition and signaling by the
mismatch repair (MMR) system (4).
A major continued concern is the broad-based epidemiologic
evidence for duration (6) and dose-dependent (7–9) increases in
the incidences of mesenchymal and solid tumors following
thiopurine treatment (6–17). This associated cancer risk has
resulted in azathioprine being classified as genotoxic and a human
carcinogen (18, 19). Although the carcinogenicity of thiopurines has
been attributed to their immunosuppressive effects, comparative
epidemiologic studies with other immune modulators also suggest
a thiopurine-specific contribution to cancer risk (9, 14, 15, 17). In
particular, in vitro and animal investigations indicate that these
agents are directly mutagenic (4, 20–25). In this regard, human
biomonitoring investigations have observed a significant increase
in the frequency of mutant T cells following thiopurine treatment
for transplant rejection (26), systemic lupus erythematosus (27),
and diabetes mellitus (28), but the etiology of these increases was
not discerned. To date, the specific mechanism(s) responsible for
the in vivo carcinogenicity of thiopurine treatment has not been
elucidated.
In this study, we investigated potential in vivo carcinogenic
mechanisms associated with thiopurine treatment by conducting a
cross-sectional analysis of its mutagenicity by examining the
frequency and spectra of somatic mutations at the hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in peripheral T cells as
well as determining the prevalence of in vivo clonal expansion of
mutant isolates in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
in relation to disease type, duration of illness, duration of
treatment, and total thiopurine dose.

Materials and Methods
Study population. The overall research design used is illustrated in
Fig. 1. In vivo mutagenicity of thiopurine treatment was examined in 119
children and adults with either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease
(CD). Both of these chronic inflammatory bowel syndromes are associated
with increased cancer risk at affected sites of inflammation (29) and
lymphoma following thiopurine intervention (13). We elected to study the
potential mutagenic effects of thiopurine treatment in subjects with IBD
because only a portion of subjects receive thiopurine intervention, and in
comparison with subjects with cancer or following transplantation, these
subjects do not receive long-term treatment with other established
mutagenic agents. Subjects with IBD were recruited from the pediatric
and adult gastroenterology clinics at Fletcher Allen Health Care, the tertiary
care facility at the University of Vermont, and consented with protocols
approved by the Committee on Human Research. Diagnosis and therapeutic
intervention were confirmed by participating gastroenterologists and a
review of medical records. Heparinized blood samples were collected from
39 children (V18 y old) and 80 adults (>18 y old). Fifty-six subjects
comprised a group of thiopurine-treated subjects who received azathioprine
(n = 40), 6-MP (n = 11), or both (n = 5), including 19 children and 17 adults
with CD and 7 children and 13 adults with UC (Table 1). Sixty-three subjects
comprise a group of nonthiopurine-treated (nonthiopurine) subjects,

Mutagenicity of Thiopurine Treatment

Figure 1. Research overview for investigating in vivo
mutagenicity and mutant cell clonal expansion in subjects
treated with thiopurines for IBD. Mononuclear cells from
peripheral blood are plated at limiting dilutions in the
absence (nonselection) and higher density in the
presence of 6-TG (selection). HPRT Mf is determined by
calculating the ratio of mean CE of selected mutant isolates
over mean nonselected CE of T cells in the absence of
selection. Both HPRT mutations and rearranged TCRb
CDR3 gene regions are used to determine in vivo mutant
cell expansion, whereas only unique HPRT mutations
are used to determine MutFreq and mutation
spectra changes.

including 4 children and 13 adults with CD and 9 children and 37 adults
with UC. All subjects previously or concurrently received other treatment
modalities that included 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives (n = 98),
corticosteroids (n = 72), infliximab (n = 21), metronidazole (n = 30), and/
or ciprofloxacin (n = 7). The total equivalent dose (moles, converted to
mmoles) of thiopurine exposure for subjects was determined by summing
the total amount of thiopurines prescribed (grams) up to sample
acquisition, divided by the molecular weight of each drug.

frequency. The HPRT T-cell cloning assay has been extensively used as a

human T lymphocytes (30, 31). Briefly, because HPRT encodes a
phosphoribosylation enzyme in the purine salvage pathway, analysis of
in vivo mutation events is accomplished by isolating HPRT-deficient T cells
from peripheral blood through in vitro selection with 6-thioguanine (6-TG).
This approach allows only cells with inactivating gene mutations to
proliferate in the presence of 6-TG. The HPRT T-cell cloning assay has
several additional characteristics that have made it a valuable human
mutation biomarker system. HPRT mutant T cells arise in a normal T-cell
milieu, uncomplicated by metabolic and genetic derangements inherent in
diseased or malignant cells, allowing for the evaluation of mutagenic
signatures related to exposure. Because the HPRT locus is located on the
X-chromosome, a single mutation event can result in a selectable mutant

phenotype and is thus more sensitive than selectable autosomal gene loci.
In addition, HPRT T-cell mutant isolates can be expanded in vitro and used
for both mutation spectra and clonality analyses. The determination
and statistical analysis for in vivo somatic HPRT mutant frequency (Mf)
in peripheral T cells by cloning HPRT mutants following limiting dilution
in the presence and absence of 6-TG have been previously described
(32, 33).
Molecular analysis of HPRT mutations and determination of mutant
cell proliferation. The HPRT biomarker system also allows for the analysis
of mutation spectra changes associated with exogenous/iatrogenic
exposures as well as the identification of independent in vivo sequential
mutation events (34) and mutant clonal proliferations by simultaneously
analyzing two independent clonality indicators: HPRT mutations and
unique T-cell receptor h (TCRb) CDR3 variable gene region sequences
(35, 36). Experimental approaches, methods and interpretations of mutation
spectra, and comparison of HPRT mutations and TCRb CDR3 variable gene
regions of mutant isolates for determining mutant proliferation have been
previously described (34–36). HPRT mutation spectra were determined by
analyzing up to 10 mutants per thiopurine-treated subject and up to 5
mutants per nonthiopurine-treated subject. HPRT mutations were characterized by performing reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification
from f1  104 cells to identify mutations within coding regions, exon
exclusions, or intron inclusions. Single exon or multiplex genomic PCR of
HPRT gene regions (37) was performed to identify splice mutations,
deletions, or insertions. HPRT mutants that showed exclusion of exons 2 to
3 in cDNA were screened for V(D)J recombinase-mediated deletions of
HPRT exons 2 to 3 with specific primers spanning that region (38). PCR
products were either separated by gel electrophoresis, extracted, and
purified via Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit or treated with 3.75 units of
exonuclease I and 1.25 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase before DNA
sequencing.
The characterization of the TCRb CDR3 variable gene regions and HPRT
mutations in mutant isolates provides two independent measures for clonal
proliferation that can be followed longitudinally (Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 34, 35). For TCRb variable gene sequence analysis, RT-PCR–generated
cDNA was amplified using a primer to the TCRb constant region and a mix
of 26 TCRb V region primers (39). The PCR products were then processed
and sequenced as described above. The prevalence of in vivo clonal

expansion was determined by analyzing 621 HPRT mutations and 611
TCRb CDR3 variable gene region sequences from 114 subjects from
whom two or more mutants were available (Supplementary Fig. S1;
Supplementary Table S2). The in vivo frequency of independent
mutation events (MutFreq) was ascertained by multiplying each subject’s
HPRT Mf by the ratio of independent mutation events to the total analyzed
mutants.
Statistical analysis. Because HPRT Mf has a log-normal distribution, all
statistical analyses were based on its natural logarithm (lnMf), which is
related to age and nonselected cloning efficiency (CE; ref. 32). We therefore
adjusted for age and CE by including them as covariates in all analyses of
lnMf (40). A summary of each subject’s gender, age, duration of illness, type
and treatment duration, total dose of thiopurine, CE, Mf, lnMf, and MutFreq
is provided (Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of covariance was used to
compare differences in lnMf among controls, nonthiopurine- and
thiopurine-treated subjects, as well as between children and adults with
UC and CD. The Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to adjust for multiple
pairwise comparisons. In thiopurine-treated subjects, the effects of
treatment duration and total dose on Mf and MutFreq were assessed by
regression analyses. A m2 test was used to compare the percents of
thiopurine- and nonthiopurine-treated subjects with mutant cell proliferation, and a Mantel-Haenszel test for linear association was used to assess
the dose dependence of increases in the percent of subjects with mutant
cell expansions. Mutation spectra data were analyzed using logistic
regression to assess the statistical significance of differences in the
proportions of specific mutations among controls (Supplementary
Table S3) and nonthiopurine- and thiopurine-treated subjects. Subjects
under the age of 12 were excluded from mutation spectra analyses because
differences in the age distributions of normal controls and IBD subjects
preclude adjustment for age-related spectra changes in this group. Age
group (12–18 or z19 y) and sex were included in the regression models as
covariates. Although mutations from the same subjects may be correlated,
we could not use a hierarchical regression model in these analyses because
the spectra data for adult controls did not contain unique subject
identifiers. The effects of treatment were determined by comparing data
only from the thiopurine- and nonthiopurine-treated subjects. Hierarchical
logistic regression models with age group (12–18 or z19 y), thiopurine
treatment (yes or no), and treatment by age group interaction were fitted to

Results
In vivo HPRT Mf in subjects with IBD. Unadjusted HPRT Mf
and lnMf data with respect to type of IBD and thiopurine treatment
for the 119 children and adults studied as well as previously
reported data used for controls (32, 40, 41) are summarized in
Table 1. The effects of IBD and nonthiopurine treatment on the
in vivo background HPRT Mf were initially assessed by comparing
lnMf in nonthiopurine-treated subjects with controls after
adjustment for age and CE. A statistically higher lnMf was
observed in one subgroup, nonthiopurine-treated children with
UC (P < 0.05), whereas lnMf in all the other nonthiopurine-treated
IBD groups was not significantly elevated. Analysis of lnMf for the
nonthiopurine-treated IBD group as a whole showed no statistical
difference from controls, indicating that IBD itself and nonthiopurine interventions did not significantly affect the background
HPRT Mf in nonthiopurine-treated IBD subjects.
For the 56 thiopurine-treated subjects, total thiopurine dose
ranged between 3.8 and 2,379 mmol taken over 0.04 to 14.1 years.
We observed a significantly higher mean lnMf in thiopurinetreated subjects compared with controls and nonthiopurinetreated subjects (P < 0.05; Table 1). Importantly, our subanalysis
revealed no significant difference in lnMf between thiopurinetreated IBD children or adults or between thiopurine-treated IBD
subjects with UC or CD. Regression analysis revealed no
significant increases in lnMf associated with duration of illness
for nonthiopurine-treated subjects (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Table S1). In contrast, we observed a significant increase in lnMf
in thiopurine-treated subjects associated with duration of illness
(P = 0.004; Fig. 2A), but of importance, this association was not
significant after adjustment for either duration of treatment or
total thiopurine dose. Specifically, the significant increases in
lnMf in thiopurine-treated subjects were related to both duration
of treatment (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S1) and
total thiopurine dose (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C) independent of duration
of illness. The estimated rate of increase in lnMf in thiopurinetreated subjects was 0.776 per year of treatment, corresponding
to a doubling in Mf. The estimated increase in lnMf with each
100 mmol increase in total dose was 0.467, corresponding to a
67% increase in Mf. The rates of increase in lnMf in thiopurinetreated subjects did not differ significantly between treated
children and adults or treated UC and CD subjects. The rates of
increase were also not drug specific because there were no
significant differences in lnMf among subjects treated with only
azathioprine, 6-MP, or both agents (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Table S1).
Prevalence of in vivo mutant cell clonal proliferation and
frequency of independent somatic HPRT mutations (MutFreq).
To gain insight into the potential effects of in vivo mutant clonal
expansion and selection for HPRT mutants on the treatmentspecific increases in mutant frequencies (Mf), we investigated the
relationship between the prevalence of clonal mutant proliferation
and the calculated MutFreq in thiopurine- and nonthiopurinetreated IBD subjects.
We determined whether thiopurine treatment results in an
increase in the prevalence of clonal proliferation of HPRT mutants
by comparing 621 characterized HPRT mutations and 611 TCRb
regions from 876 HPRT mutants from 114 nonthiopurine- and
thiopurine-treated IBD subjects (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S1). The percents of nonthiopurine-treated children
and adults in which there were two or more HPRT mutant isolates
associated with mutant clonal expansions were 0% and 14.6%,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

respectively (Fig. 3A). In contrast, there were significant increases
in the percents of thiopurine-treated children (72.2%) and adults
(63.3%) with mutant clonal expansions compared with nonthiopurine-treated subjects (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). There were also
significant dose-dependent increases in the proportion of subjects
with mutant clonal expansions (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B).
The prevalence of in vivo mutant clonal expansion in these
subjects was then used to correct for the possible contribution
of in vivo mutant proliferation on the treatment-specific increases
in lnMf to estimate the frequency of independent in vivo somatic
mutation events (MutFreq). For thiopurine-treated subjects,
the MutFreq was significantly lower than Mf (P < 0.001) as a
consequence of mutant clonal expansions associated with
treatment. But of importance, we also observed significant
increases in MutFreq in thiopurine-treated subjects as seen with
Mf that correlated specifically with treatment duration and total
dose (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table S1). This strongly
suggests that the significant increases in MutFreq following
thiopurine treatment are not the result of selective in vivo
expansion of preexisting HPRT mutants.
Mutation spectra analysis. The in vivo mutagenicity of
thiopurine treatment was further examined by comparing 648

independent mutations from a composite of controls and 372
independent mutations from 105 IBD subjects 12 years and older
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Nineteen percent of the
randomly selected HPRT mutants from IBD subjects remained
uncharacterized, which is consistent with previous human
biomonitoring HPRT spectra studies (36, 42). Reasons for the
uncharacterized mutants include (a) exon exclusions in mutants
from female subjects in which splice alterations and deletions
could not be confirmed or detected; (b) no cDNA detected, with
genomic PCR products of exons 1 and 9 showing no mutations; (c)
cDNA revealed no mutation; and (d) incomplete analysis.
We observed no significant differences in the spectra of
mutations between nonthiopurine-treated subjects compared with

controls (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). This
establishes that there is no detectable IBD disease or nonthiopurine treatment–specific differences in the proportions of
mutations. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the
proportion of all transitions in thiopurine-treated subjects (52.9%)
compared with nonthiopurine-treated subjects (39.8%; P = 0.016)
and controls (34.4%; P < 0.001) after adjustment for age and
multiple observations per subject. In particular, there was a
significant increase in the proportion of G:C to A:T transitions at

compared with nonthiopurine-treated subjects (27.7%; P = 0.037)
and controls (20.7%; P < 0.001; Fig. 4A; Supplementary Tables S2
and S3). The increase in transitions was also accompanied by a

concomitant significant decrease in the proportion of all transversions among thiopurine-treated subjects (22.8%) compared with
controls (34.6%; P = 0.021).
We also observed a significant dose-dependent increase in the
proportion of all transitions (P = 0.013), particularly G:C to A:T
transitions (P = 0.045) at non-CpG dinucleotides after adjustment
for age and multiple observations per subject, which supports our
overall spectra findings (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S2). This
increase in G:C to A:T transitions is consistent with the in vitro
mutagenic signature observed for these drugs (4, 20, 22).
Thiopurine treatment also resulted in a distinct distribution of
unique G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides at both
coding and noncoding/splice site base pair positions in thiopurinetreated subjects compared with nonthiopurine-treated subjects
(Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S4). There was an increase in the
occurrence of unique G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG
dinucleotides (n = 38, compared with n = 32) at both coding and
noncoding sites and in the number of unique sites (n = 18,
compared with n = 12) in thiopurine-treated subjects compared
with nonthiopurine-treated subjects. There were 20 common sites
(coding and noncoding) in which these transitions occurred in
both nonthiopurine- and thiopurine-treated subjects. The most

frequent mutation coding sites (more than three events) for G:C to
A:T transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides in nonthiopurine-treated
subjects were at positions 538, 551, and 617. For thiopurine
subjects, the most frequent coding sites were at positions 3, 197,
463, 485, 539, and 617. Of interest is that G:C to A:T transitions at
non-CpG dinucleotides at positions 463 and 539 in thiopurinetreated subjects were not observed in nonthiopurine-treated
subjects. Analogous findings were also observed at splice site
sequences. In addition, the distribution of these transitions at
coding and noncoding regions is consistent in each treatment
group and distribution subcategory. These data suggest that the
distribution of G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides
in thiopurine subjects represents both thiopurine-specific and
preexisting mutations and not simply an increase in spontaneous
or hotspot mutation events.

Discussion
Investigations attempting to link treatment-specific mutations
to carcinogenic risk in humans are extraordinarily difficult because
of the necessity to control for a multitude of complex variables,
including the genetic and cellular effects of the underlying

Mutagenicity of Thiopurine Treatment

disease(s), duration and total dose of each therapeutic intervention, as well as other environmental exposures. Furthermore,
tumors themselves are genomically unstable, making potential
primary and secondary cancer-relevant mutations difficult to
discern. With respect to this study, definitively linking thiopurine
mutation induction in IBD subjects to the formation of specific
tumors is currently not possible because data for cancer-specific
mutations in tumors from subjects who only received thiopurine
treatment does not exist. Hence, identifying the in vivo induction
of treatment-specific mutations in nontransformed cells is an
extremely important approach for elucidating potential carcinogenic mutagenic events directly in subjects receiving this
treatment.
In this study, we provide evidence that chronic thiopurine
treatment results in a dose-dependent increase in the in vivo
frequency of somatic mutations, particularly a treatment-specific
increase in G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides, which
is consistent with the in vitro mutation signature of these drugs
(4, 22). These data strongly suggest that thiopurine intervention is
mutagenic in humans.
These findings were ascertained by determining the frequency
and spectra of somatic mutations at the HPRT locus in peripheral
human T cells and an examination of in vivo preexisting or induced
mutant cell clonal proliferation by combining the analysis of two
distinct clonality signatures (35). Because the mutation events
observed were investigated in subjects receiving chronic thiopurine
treatment, the possibility exists for the in vivo selection and
enrichment of preexisting HPRT mutants with potential growth
advantages that may influence the relative contribution of
thiopurine therapy on the observed Mf. This effect is unlikely
because we observed a significant dose-dependent increase in
MutFreq, which has been corrected for both preexisting and
treatment-induced clonal expansion of mutant cells. The potential
in vivo cytotoxic effects of thiopurines on proliferating non-HPRT
mutants with the concomitant survival of HPRT mutants could also
theoretically have influenced our results. This seems unlikely as
well because we concurrently observed significant dose-dependent
mutation spectra changes. The latter observations establish the
in vivo mutagenicity of thiopurine intervention because significant
spectra changes would not occur if this treatment simply enriched
for the expansion of preexisting HPRT mutants. It is also important
to note that all of these findings were independent of the
underlying disease, duration of disease, and other therapeutic
interventions.
We were unable to specifically evaluate the effects of other
potential environmental exposures because of limited data. The
most important exogenous exposure likely to influence our
observations would be environmental tobacco smoke, which has
previously been shown to result in an increase in V(D)J
recombinase-mediated deletions in newborns (43) and no spectra
changes or an increase in the proportion of G:C to T:A
transversions in adults (44, 45). This is in contrast to the significant
proportional decrease in transversions and an increase in G:C to
A:T transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides observed in thiopurinetreated subjects.
The induction of G:C to A:T transition mutations by thiopurine
treatment is likely the result of incorporation of 6-TG nucleotides
into DNA and subsequent mispairing with thymine in replicating
cells (4, 20, 22, 25). Support for the carcinogenicity of a thiopurinespecific mutagenic mechanism can be inferred from epidemiologic
evidence correlating azathioprine treatment with significantly

higher incidences of solid tumors, lymphoproliferative disorders,
and skin cancers when compared with other immune modulators,
including mycophenolate mofetil, which closely resembles thiopurines in its mechanism of action (9, 14, 15, 17, 25, 46).
Mycophenolate mofetil primarily inhibits IMP dehydrogenase,
resulting in the inhibition of purine synthesis, whereas azathioprine
and 6-MP exert their cytotoxicity by inhibiting purine synthesis and
by incorporation into DNA. This suggests that the increased cancer
risk associated with thiopurine treatment is associated with the
mutagenicity of these agents following DNA incorporation.
The significant increase in the prevalence of treatment-specific
cell proliferation may represent an additional mechanism for
accumulating G:T mismatches from unrepaired replication errors
(47) as well as by enhancing incorporation of 6-TG nucleotides
during DNA replication. Clonal proliferation among mutants, with
the associated failure to find similar patterns among nonmutant
cells, further implicates cell proliferation as a significant in vivo
mutagenic mechanism.
Cellular resistance to thiopurines has been shown in vitro to
select for cells defective in MMR, whereas microsatellite instability
has been observed in acute myelogenous leukemia from transplant
patients following azathioprine treatment (8). It is not known
whether our findings could also be attributed to the in vivo
selection of MMR-defective cells and the in vivo emergence of cells
with genomic instability.
Our data indicate that thiopurine treatment could potentially
lead to somatic mutations at disease-specific loci in actively
replicating tissue cell populations, including (a) the bone marrow,
which has been shown to incorporate higher levels of 6-TG
nucleotides (48), and (b) activated immune cells and epithelial
tissues undergoing repeated cycles of repair and cell regeneration,
especially in subjects with IBD and chronic graft-versus-host
disease (29, 49). Lymphocytes and skin epithelium of patients who
received thiopurine treatment have also been shown to incorporate
6-TG nucleotides (24, 50). In this study, we also observed an
increase in G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG dinucleotides in
clonally proliferating activated T cells, some of which may have a
recent precursor origin (data not shown). Altogether, these
observations provide an important connection between the
mutagenicity of thiopurine intervention in these cell populations
and the increased risk of leukemia (8), lymphoma (7, 12, 13), and
skin cancer (9, 10, 17).
In this cross-sectional study, we provide evidence that suggests
that thiopurine intervention is mutagenic, resulting in a dosedependent increase in the frequency of somatic mutations and
treatment-specific mutation induction of G:C to A:T transitions at
non-CpG dinucleotides. These findings provide direct in vivo
evidence for mutation induction as a potential carcinogenic
mechanism associated with chronic thiopurine intervention.
