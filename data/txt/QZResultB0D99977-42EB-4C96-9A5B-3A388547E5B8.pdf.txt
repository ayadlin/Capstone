Febrifugine (FF) is the active component of the Chinese herb Chang Shan (Dichroa
febrifuga Lour)1,2, which has been used for treating malaria-induced fever for about 2000
years. Halofuginone (HF), the halogenated derivative of FF, has had clinical trials for
potential therapeutic applications in cancer and fibrotic disease 3-6. Recently, HF was
reported to inhibit TH17 cell differentiation by activating the amino acid response (AAR)
pathway7, through inhibiting human prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) to cause intracellular
accumulation of uncharged tRNA8,9. Curiously, inhibition requires un-hydrolyzed ATP.
Here we report an unusual 2.0 Å structure showing that ATP directly locks onto and orients
two parts of HF onto human ProRS, so that one part of HF mimics bound proline and the
other mimics the 3′-end of bound tRNA. Thus, HF is a novel ATP-dependent inhibitor that
simultaneously occupies two different substrate binding sites. Moreover, our structure
suggests that the efficacy of FF for malaria treatment might work by a similar mechanism.
Finally, the elucidation here of a two-site modular targeting activity of HF raises the
possibility that substrate-directed capture of similar inhibitors might be generalized to other
synthetases.

ProRS is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRSs) family of enzymes that
activate amino acids for protein synthesis through formation of aminoacyl adenylates (AAAMP) and subsequent transfer of the activated amino acids to the 3′-ends of the cognate
tRNAs. Because of their crucial role in protein synthesis, aaRS inhibition halts the growth
and suppresses viability of all cell types. Consequently, aaRSs are attractive targets for
discovering drugs, like antibiotics and suppressors of cell hyperproliferation10,11. Many
tRNA synthetase inhibitors mimic AA-AMPs, and thereby directly block the active site.
Because the AA-AMP mimics occupy the active site for ATP and amino acid, they compete
out the substrate ATP. In contrast, ATP was reported to be essential for HF binding to

ProRS8. This ATP dependence suggested HF binds to ProRS through a novel mechanism
and not as a mimetic of Pro-AMP. Thus, understanding how HF inhibits human ProRS is of
great interest.

Author Manuscript

In its simplest description, HF is comprised of a hydroxypiperidine ring joined by bridging
atoms to a double ring halogenated 4-quinazolinone (Fig. 1a). To clarify the mechanism of
inhibition of HF, we cloned and expressed human ProRS and were able to obtain co-crystals
with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ((adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate)(ATPa)) and
HF, which diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). The structure was solved
by molecular replacement using T. thermophilus ProRS as template. The asymmetric unit
contained two ProRS molecules that formed a homodimer (Fig. 1b), as also seen in gel
filtration experiments. Each subunit encoded an N-terminal catalytic domain characteristic
of a class II tRNA synthetase, an anticodon-binding domain, and a C-terminal zinc-binding
domain (Fig. 1b). In the two catalytic domains of the ProRS homodimer, HF and ATPa were
bound to the active site for Pro-AMP formation (Fig. 1b, c).

Author Manuscript

ATPa was located at the canonical ATP binding pocket of class II aaRSs12. Three hydrogen
bonds contributed by Thr1164 and Thr1276 and hydrophobic stacking of Phe1167 stabilized
the adenosine group (Supplementary Fig. 2). The ribose moiety was fixed by three hydrogen
bonds with Gln1237, Thr1240 and Arg1278. The hydrogen bonds from Arg1152 and
Arg1163 contributed to stabilizing the α-, β- and γ-phosphate groups of ATPa
(Supplementary Fig. 2), which form a cap over the HF binding pocket (Fig. 1c). These
extensive hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions fixed the ATP in a “U”-like bent
conformation with the α-phosphate group exposed at the bottom of the U. Superposition of
the catalytic domains of human ProRS with that of the previously determined structure of T.
thermophilus ProRS showed the conformation and location of ATP was the same
(Supplementary Fig. 3), with the α-phosphate group poised for proline activation. In the
human ProRS:HF:ATPa ternary complex, the α-phosphate group is proximal to the
hydroxypiperidine ring of HF and forms two hydrogen bonds with its hydroxyl group (Fig.
2a, b). It also forms an additional hydrogen bond with the keto group in the bridge between
the piperidine ring and the quinazolinone moiety of HF (Fig. 2a, b). These direct hydrogenbond interactions enable ATP to lock onto and orient HF.

Author Manuscript

Beside the interactions from ATP, ProRS itself forms seven hydrogen bonds and several
hydrophobic contacts with each moiety of HF (Fig. 2a, b). Thus, the pocket for the HF
piperidine ring, built by Thr1121, Glu1123, Trp1169, Glu1171, His1173, Thr1240, His1242
and Ser1272 (Fig. 2c), has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. These residues are
absolutely conserved among eukaryotic ProRS (Supplementary Fig. 4), and were found to
be also important for proline recognition in the structure of T. thermophilus eukaryotic-like
ProRS with proline (Fig. 2d)13. Overlay of the catalytic domains of the human and T.
thermophilus ProRS structures showed the piperidine ring of HF bound to the same site as
proline (Fig. 2e). In particular, the orientations of the proline pyrrolidine ring and of the HF
piperidine ring, and the locations of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, are similar. Thus, the HF
piperidine ring appears as a proline-like group, and would directly compete with proline and
block proline activation. The proline mimic mechanism is consistent with HF/FF derivatives
with modifications on piperidine ring being unfit for binding to the proline-binding pocket,

and, therefore, unable to inhibit or bind to ProRS or affect cell function (e.g. MAZ1310)8. In
contrast, derivatives that replaced the piperidine ring by the pyrrolidine ring of proline
retained the similar or superior biological activity that was tested14.

The halogenated 4-quinazolinone group is buried in a pocket mainly comprised of Leu1087,
Phe1097, Val1101, Pro1120, Thr1121 and Arg1152 (Fig. 2a, f). Beside the hydrogen bond
between Arg1152 and nitrogen atom, the quinazolinone group was mainly stabilized by
hydrophobic contacts, particularly by the hydrophobic stack effect from Phe1097 (Fig. 2a,
f). ThrRS also belongs to class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and it is the closest homolog
to ProRS. Arg1152 and Phe1097 of ProRS are conserved in class II synthetases. Their
corresponding residues Arg363 and Tyr313 in the structure of E. coli threonyl-tRNA
synthetase (ThrRS) were found to flank the two sides of the adenosine of A76 of tRNAThr
and thus play crucial roles in CCA 3′-end binding (Fig. 2g)15. Beside these two residues,
other parts of the A76 adenosine pocket are also quite similar to the quinazolinone group
binding pocket in the ProRS structure (Fig. 2g). Overlay of the ProRS and ThrRS structures
by aligning the conserved 7-strand β-sheet core of their catalytic domains showed that the
quinazolinone group of HF bound to the same position as bound A76, and with a similar
orientation and similar side chain contacts (Fig. 2h). This structural similarity suggests that
the quinazolinone group of HF binds to ProRS by employing a strategy of mimicking the
terminal adenosine of the tRNA substrate. Thus, in contrast to the single-site and
conventional AA-AMP mimics, HF is a dual site inhibitor by virtue of simultaneously
occupying two active site pockets (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We used our crystal structure of the ProRS:ATP:HF complex to further dissect the
mechanism of action of HF. Prior work by others showed that HF specifically inhibits
overall aminoacylation of tRNAPro and that binding of HF to ProRS is greatly enhanced by
ATP8. (Not known was how much weaker HF binds in the absence of ATP.) According to
our structure, HF is ‘two-headed’ and, with bound ATP, uses the piperidine ring to block the
proline binding site and the quinazolinone group to block the site for docking the 3′-end of
tRNAPro. We designed experiments to probe the function of each site, i.e., the site for
adenylate formation/binding and that for docking the 3′-end of tRNA. In addition to HF, we
used another inhibitor, Pro-SA (5′-O-(N-(L-prolyl)-sulfamoyl-adenosine), as a comparator.
Pro-SA is a tight-binding non-reactive adenylate analog of Pro-AMP16.

We first determined that the thermal melting of ProRS was barely affected by either proline
or ATPa. In contrast, in the presence of HF, the melting curve was shifted to higher
temperature by about 10 oC by HF alone, and by about 18 oC with HF plus ATPa (Fig 3a).
These data show that HF binds even in the absence of ATP, and also confirm that HF binds
much tighter in the presence of ATP. Not surprisingly, the thermal shift obtained with ProSA was the largest.
To probe the adenylate-formation site, we studied the first step of aminoacylation, which is
the activation of proline by ProRS to form a tightly bound Pro-AMP adenylate complex and
release of PPi.

The conventional proline-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction was used. As expected,
both Pro-SA and HF were potent inhibitors of this reaction in a dose-dependent fashion,
with Pro-SA being more effective (Fig. 3b). This result is consistent with the thermal
melting data of Figure 3a showing the tighter binding of Pro-SA, and with our x-ray crystal
structure showing the docking of one ‘head’ of HF at the site for the prolyl moiety of ProAMP.

Author Manuscript

Next, we investigated the ability of HF to mimic docking of A76 of tRNAPro to ProRS. For
this purpose we studied the effect of HF on the relatively stable preformed ProRS:Pro-AMP
complex, which was isolated on a column. Because binding of tRNA to tRNA synthetases is
generally associated with conformational changes that mobilize the active site for transfer of
the activated amino acid to A76, we reasoned that binding of the A76-mimicking
quinazolinone group of HF would result in an abortive transfer and thereby release ProAMP from ProRS. Accordingly, the ProRS:Pro-AMP complex was incubated separately
with Pro-SA (which should not have access to the A76 site) and with HF (without ATP). As
expected, Pro-SA caused some reduction in the bound Pro-AMP, which is attributed to an
exchange on the enzyme between bound Pro-AMP and Pro-SA. In contrast, free HF, while
having a much lower affinity than Pro-SA for ProRS, completely released Pro-AMP from
the complex (Fig. 3c).This result supports the conclusion (from our x-ray structure) that HF
also mimics A76 of tRNA.

Author Manuscript

HF is a halogenated derivative of febrifugine, which is the bioactive constituent in the
Chang Shan herb that has long been used to treat malaria. The human and malaria parasite
P. falciparum ProRS binding sites are highly conversed (Supplementary Fig. 4). With that in
mind, using our ATP-dependent docking of HF to human ProRS as a template, we were able
to show the potential for docking of FF to P. falcipaurm ProRS (Fig. 4). Thus, our analysis
suggests malarial ProRS may also be the target of FF. This possibility could also explain
why the killing effect of FF on P. falciparum in culture is reversed by proline8.
Interestingly, in addition to the inhibition of amino acid activation by mimics of AA-AMP
(including the “operational” mimic pseudomonic acid (mupirocin)17), the ATP-dependent
two-site HF inhibition mechanism reported here, and the single-site tRNA-dependent
editing-site-trapping mechanism reported earlier18, illustrate two entirely different and
unusual mechanisms for substrate participation in capture of an inhibitor (Supplementary
Fig. 5). In addition, by substitution of the piperidine ring with other amino acid mimics, dual
site inhibitors could in principle be designed for some other aaRSs.

Protein expression and purification
The cDNA fragment encoding human prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) was cloned into
E.coli plasmid pET21a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), with an additional N-terminal
His6-tag. The plasmid encoding ProRS was transformed into E.coli strain BL21(DE3)
pLysS (Life Technologies, San Diego, CA) and was induced overnight for overexpression
with 0.5 mM IPTG at room temperature. The E.coli cell lysate was firstly loaded onto a NiNTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the elution fraction was further purified with

mono Q ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, 5/50 GL, Piscataway, NJ) to a
single band as indicated on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The purified
protein was found as a single peak with the elution volume consistent with a homogeneous
ProRS homodimer on the Superdex 200 analytical gel filtration column (GE Healthcare,
10/300 GL). The purified ProRS was finally concentrated to 50 mg/mL and stored at −80°C
in a buffer of 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM Tris (pH 8.0).
Crystallization and data collection

Author Manuscript

ProRS was crystallized with the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method using a Mosquito robot
(TTP Labtech, Cambridge, MA). Prior to crystallization, ProRS was diluted to 40 mg/mL
with 3 mM halofuginone (racemic mixture) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 5 mM ATP
analog adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM βmercaptoethanol, and then incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, sitting drops were set up by
mixing 100 nL of protein (40 mg/mL) and 100 nL of reservoir solution containing 20%
(w/v) PEG 3350, 0.6 M CaCl2 and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), and equilibrated against a 70
μL of reservoir solution at 30°C for 2–3 days before data collection. The X-ray diffraction
data were collected using a single crystal at a wavelength of 1.000 Å and temperature of 100
oK at beamline 7-1 of Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The complete
data set contains 500 images with the oscillation angle of 0.5° for each image. The
ProRS:HF:ATPa crystal belonged to space group P21. Data were integrated and scaled with
the program HKL200022.
Structure determination and refinement

Author Manuscript

The initial model was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP23.
The crystal structure of T. thermophilus ProRS (PDB code 1HC7), which has 43% sequence
identity to human ProRS, was used as the searching model. The structure was further refined
by iterative cycles of positional refinement and TLS refinement with Refmac524 and
Phenix25 and model building with COOT26, and the final model was refined to 2.0 Å
resolution with Rwork/Rfree of 20.4%/22.7%. The model has good geometry quality, and
98.9%/99.8% residues are in favored/allowed regions of the MolProbity27 Ramachandran
plot. Statistics of data collection and structure refinement are given in Supplementary Table
1. The atomic coordinates and structural factors have been deposited into Protein Data Bank
under the code 4HVC.
Sequence analysis and Structure Presentation

Author Manuscript

Protein sequences were aligned using the program Multalin28. The alignment result was
submitted to ESPript29 for figure generation. All protein structure illustrations were prepared
with the program PyMol (www.pymol.org).
Thermal Shift Assay
ProRS (3 μg) was diluted in 30 μL buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0,
1/2500 SYPRO Orange dye (Life Technologies) and different ligands (5 mM ATPa, 5 mM
proline, 1 mM HF, 1 mM HF + 5 mM ATPa, or 1 mM Pro-SA, respectively), and incubated
at room temperature for 10 min. Then, ProRS samples were heated from 25 to 98°C at a rate

of 1°C/min, and the fluorescence signals were monitored by the StepOnePlus real-time PCR
system (Life Technologies). Each curve is an average of three measurements.
ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assays

Author Manuscript

The reaction buffer contained 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
DTT, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM Na pyrophosphate (NaPPi), 20 μCi/ml 32P-PPi and 0.5 mM proline.
Inhibitor HF and Pro-SA (5′-O-(N-(L-prolyl)-sulfamoyl)adenosine (kindly provided by Prof.
Karin Musier-Forsyth, The Ohio State University) were added at different concentrations (0,
30 or 90 nM). The reactions were started by adding ProRS into buffer at the final
concentration of 10 nM, and then incubated at 20°C. 20 μL of each of the reactions was
quenched at different time points in 200 μL quench buffer (1 M HCl, 200 mM NaPPi, 4%
charcoal). The free 32P-PPi was removed by flowing through the 96-well PVDF filter plates,
and the residual 32P-PPi was washed five times using 200 μL washing buffer (1 M HCl and
200 mM NaPPi). Then, the produced 32P-ATP remaining in filter plates was transferred to
scintillation vials and counted. The data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). The experiments here and below were independently repeated three
times with duplicated measurements each time.
HF - Pro-AMP competition assay

Author Manuscript

The isolation of ProRS:Pro-AMP was slightly modified from that of a previous report30. In
brief, 2 μM ProRS was added to the buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM KCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT, 20 μM proline and 1 μM 3H-proline, and then
incubated at 4°C for 10 min to create ProRS:3H-Pro-AMP. The reaction containing
ProRS:3H-Pro-AMP was flowed through a desalting column (SpinTrap G-25, GE
healthcare) to isolate the complex and remove the extra ATP and proline. HF and Pro-SA
were added at the concentration of 4 μM to the complex to compete for 10 min at 20°C. The
reaction was passed through desalting column again to remove dissociated 3H-Pro-AMP.
The eluted 3H-Pro-AMP still bound to ProRS was then measured.

ProRS. d, The proline binding pocket of T. thermophilus ProRS in complex with proline
(PDB 1H4T, protein is colored as yellow and proline as gray-white). e, Structure
superposition of catalytic domain of human ProRS with T. thermophilus ProRS reveals the
piperidine ring of HF directly occupies the proline binding pocket. f, The stick model
showing the binding of the halogenated 4-quinazolinone group of HF to human ProRS. g,
Structure of E. coli ThrRS:tRNA complex, with the pocket for the adenosine group for A76
(PDB 1QF6). h, Overlay of the catalytic domain of human ProRS onto E. coli ThrRS
(brown) reveals that HF uses the binding pocket for A76 of the CCA76-3′ end for binding
the quinazolinone moiety.

a, Thermal melting19 of ProRS in the presence of different ligands. HF binds in the absence
of ATPa, and binds more strongly in the presence of ATPa. b, HF and the comparator ProSA block formation of Pro-AMP, in the proline-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction. The
inset shows that HF had no effect on the alanine-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction with
AlaRS. c, HF mobilizes the release of Pro-AMP from ProRS. The ProRS:3H-Pro-AMP
complex was prepared on ice and then isolated on a column and for 10 min was left
untreated, or exposed to HF, or exposed to Pro-SA, respectively. The complex was then rerun on the column and the amount of bound 3H-Pro-AMP was determined. The inset shows
that the isolated 3H-Pro was activated (as 3H-Pro-AMP) and could be transferred to tRNA.
Error bars are s.e.m. (n=2).

Febrifugine (FF) docked to the active site of P. falcipaurm ProRS (UniProtKB code
Q8I5R7). ProRS and FF are colored as cyan and yellow, respectively. The hydrogen bonds
are indicated with dashes. The P. falciparum ProRS structure was generated by the protein
structure homology-modeling sever SWISS-MODEL20. FF was docked into the P.
falciparum ProRS active site based on the structure of ProRS:halofuginone:ATPa complex,
while ATP was docked based on the structure of the T. thermophilus ProRS:tRNA:ATP
complex (PDB code 1H4Q).
