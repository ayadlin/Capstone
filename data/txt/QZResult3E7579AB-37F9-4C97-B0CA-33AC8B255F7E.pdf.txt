Abstract

Author Manuscript

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is a well-studied growth regulatory pathway
implicated in breast cancer biology. Clinical trials testing monoclonal antibodies directed against
the type I IGF receptor (IGF1R) in combination with estrogen receptor-α (ER) targeting have
been completed, but failed to show benefits in patients with endocrine resistant tumors compared
to ER targeting alone. We have previously shown that the closely related insulin receptor (InsR) is
expressed in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells. Here we examined if inhibition of InsR
affected tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) breast cancer cells. InsR function was inhibited by three
different mechanisms: InsR shRNA, a small InsR blocking peptide, S961 and an InsR monoclonal
antibody (mAb). Suppression of InsR function by these methods in TamR cells successfully
blocked insulin-mediated signaling, monolayer proliferation, cell cycle progression and
anchorage-independent growth. This strategy was not effective in parental cells likely due to the
presence of IGFR/InsR hybrid receptors. Down-regulation of IGF1R in conjunction with InsR
inhibition was more effective in blocking IGF- and insulin-mediated signaling and growth in
parental cells compared to single receptor targeting alone. Our findings show TamR cells were
stimulated by InsR and were not sensitive to IGF1R inhibition, whereas in tamoxifen-sensitive
parental cancer cells, the presence of both receptors, especially hybrid receptors, allowed crossreactivity of ligand-mediated activation and growth. To suppress the IGF system, targeting of both
IGF1R and InsR is optimal in endocrine sensitive and resistant breast cancer.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Approximately 75% of the breast cancer cases express estrogen receptor-α (ER),
representing the most prevalent breast cancer subtype (1). Patients with ER-positive breast
cancer can be treated by inhibiting ER function. This strategy has been successful in early
stage and advanced breast cancer (2, 3), but a significant proportion of patients never

responded to ER inhibition (de novo or primary resistance) or have progression after a
prolonged period of therapy (acquired or secondary resistance) (4, 5). Endocrine resistance
still poses a key clinical problem. Recently, targeting of mTORC1 and CDK4/6 have been
used to treat ER-positive tumors (6, 7), but there is still a need for additional strategies,
aiming to delay or ideally overcome resistance to endocrine therapy.

Author Manuscript

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling occurs through multiple receptors including the
type I IGF receptor (IGF1R), insulin receptor (InsR), and hybrid IGF1R/InsR. This receptor
system has been implicated in cancer development as well as crosstalk with ER, suggesting
that it may contribute to the regulation of ER-positive breast cancer (8, 9). IGF1R is an
estrogen regulated gene and enhances ER transcriptional activity, suggesting co-targeting of
receptors might be clinical useful (10, 11). A number of anti-IGF inhibitors including antiIGF1R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) and ligand
neutralizing antibodies were developed primarily to target IGF1R and IGF ligands while
leaving InsR unperturbed (12). Despite the hope that anti-IGF1R targeted therapies would
provide clinical benefit in endocrine resistant breast cancer, we showed that tamoxifen
resistant (TamR) cells lacked IGF1R expression (13). This finding was validated in women
with breast cancers – recurrent endocrine treated tumors showed lower level of IGF1R
compared to the pre-treated tumors (14, 15). Thus, it would be unlikely for anti-IGF1R
mAbs to have clinical activity in endocrine resistant cells. These observations likely explain
why the results of phase III clinical trials of anti-IGF1R mAbs tested in endocrine resistant
population have been negative (16).

Author Manuscript

Unlike IGF1R, InsR is not an estrogen regulated gene and its level remained intact in TamR
cells. InsR is closely related to IGF1R, sharing 84% similarity within catalytic domain, 45–
65% in ligand-binding domain and more than 50% in the overall amino acid sequence (17).
The highly homologous InsR activates almost identical downstream signaling cascades in a
ligand-dependent fashion. On the loss of IGF1R function, osteoblasts shifted from IGF- to
insulin-mediated growth and differentiation (18). Down-regulation of IGF1R in breast
cancer increased sensitivity to insulin (19). In addition, a patient tumor developed an
increased InsR gene copy number while being treated with, and eventually becoming
resistant to endocrine therapy (20). Although InsR expression in cancer has been
documented for several decades (21–24), InsR inhibition has been intentionally avoided
because of concern over disrupting glucose homeostasis.

Author Manuscript

InsR inhibitors have been developed as dual IGF1R/InsR tyrosine kinase inhibitors:
BMS-754807 and OSI-906. These two drugs have completed several clinical trials,
including a phase II study against ER+ breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitors. The
trial has completed but the results have not been disclosed (NCT01225172). Early clinical
evidence suggests that TKIs are safer than originally anticipated. Although hyperglycemia
was evident in patients treated with OSI-906, encouraging disease control was observed in
patients (25, 26).
In this study, we determined that InsR signaling serves as a bypass pathway and
compensates for the loss of IGF1R in TamR breast cancer cells. We suppressed InsR
functions using three different mechanisms in TamR versus parental breast cancer cells. Our

data showed that InsR inhibition alone blocked signaling and cell proliferation in TamR cells
but not in the parental cells. When anti-IGF1R mAb was given in conjunction with InsR
inhibitor, a complete suppression of insulin-stimulated growth in parental cells was
observed, suggesting the involvement of hybrid receptors in the mediation of IGF/insulin in
breast cancer cells. Thus, dual inhibition of IGF1R and InsR is necessary for optimal
suppression of this signaling system.

Results
TamR cells were more sensitive to insulin treatment compared to their parental cells

Author Manuscript

MCF-7L and T47D are ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines and are estrogen sensitive
and are inhibited by selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen. We
previously generated TamR cells from MCF-7L and T47D and showed reduced IGF1R
expression levels and a lack of efficacy of anti-IGF1R monoclonal antibodies in TamR cells.
However, AEW541, a dual TKI that targets both IGF1R and InsR was able to inhibit insulinand IGF-stimulated signaling and growth (13).
To better understand the role of insulin/InsR in TamR cells, we treated MCF-7L, T47D and
their TamR cells with increasing concentrations of insulin for 15 minutes. As measured by
AKT, P70S6K and MAPK phosphorylation, insulin signaling stimulated phosphorylation at
lower levels of insulin in TamR cells compared to MCF-7L or T47D parental cells (Fig. 1A).
Monolayer growth and soft agar assays showed greater proliferation and colony formation at
lower concentrations of insulin in TamR cells compared to their parental cells (Fig. 1B and
C).

Genetic knockdown of InsR reduced insulin-regulated signaling and growth in TamR cells,
but not in the parental cells
Stable InsR knockdown cell lines were generated in MCF-7L, T47D and their TamR cells
using lentiviral shRNA. IGF1R level was unaffected in both MCF-7L and T47D parental
cells. Compared to control shRNA, shIR#6 was a more efficient knockdown construct than
shIR#2 as down-regulation of InsR protein and mRNA levels were greater in cells
transduced with shIR#6, validated by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A and B). A
reduction of insulin-mediated signaling was measured by IGF1R/InsR, AKT, MAPK,
P70S6K and IRS (pY-20) phosphorylation after InsR knockdown in TamR cells especially in
shIR#6 TamR cells. Surprisingly, this was not the case in parental cells even though the InsR
level was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 2A).

Author Manuscript

It was notable that even with knockdown, some InsR biochemical activity could be seen. To
further determine the biological significance of InsR knockdown, cells were studied by cell
cycle analyses, monolayer growth, and anchorage-independent growth assays. Downregulation of InsR abolished insulin-mediated proliferation (Fig. 2C), cell cycle progression
(Table 1) and anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 2D) in MCF-7L and T47D TamR cells,
but not in MCF-7L or T47D parental cells. Re-introduction of recombinant human InsR
(hIR) in shIR#2 and shIR#6 transduced MCF-7L TamR cells rescued insulin-mediated
signaling (Fig. S1A) and cell proliferation (Fig. S1B).

In contrast, InsR overexpression in both MCF-7L and TamR cells showed an up-regulation
of InsR protein level and also insulin-mediated phosphorylation of IRS (pY-20), AKT,
P70S6K and MAPK (Fig. S2A). However, only MCF-7L TamR cells showed a significant
increase in cell proliferation (Fig. S2B).
S961 inhibited insulin-regulated PI3K/MAPK signaling and growth in TamR cells, but not in
parental cells

Author Manuscript

S961, a small peptide was synthesized and shown to be a competitive antagonist with a
slightly higher affinity to InsR than insulin and partial agonist effects at lower concentrations
(27). S961 has very low affinity for IGF1R. To examine the effect of S961 in endocrine
resistance cells, cells were pre-treated with increasing concentrations of S961 before
exposing cells to either IGF-I or insulin. S961 did not inhibit IGF-I or insulin-regulated
signaling in MCF-7L and T47D parental cells even at high concentration as shown by
IGF1R/InsR, AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, S3A). Similarly, S961 did not
inhibit insulin or IGF-I stimulated cell cycle progression or anchorage-independent growth
in parental cells (Fig. 3B, 3C, S4A and Table S1). Even though agonist effects of S961 have
been reported, we did not observe S961-induced signaling or cell proliferation in these
breast cancer cells (Fig. 5B).

Author Manuscript

In contrast, S961 blocked insulin-regulated signaling even at concentrations as low as 1 nM
concentration in TamR cells (Fig. 3A and S3B). Similar sensitivity was reflected in
anchorage-independent growth assay (Fig. 3B and S4B) and cell cycle analysis (Fig. 3C and
Table S1), where 1 nM concentration of S961 fully diminished insulin-stimulated colony
formation growth and S-phase induction, respectively in MCF-7L TamR cells. A higher
S961 concentration was needed to fully block insulin-stimulated growth in T47D TamR
cells. Since TamR cells lack IGF1R, they do not respond to IGF-I stimulation.
83-7 mAb down-regulates InsR, thus inhibiting insulin-stimulated signaling and growth in
TamR cells
Monoclonal antibody clone 83-7 (83-7 mAb) binds alpha-subunit of InsR allosterically
without interfering insulin binding (28) and is specific for InsR binding although its
functional roles in cells are not well studied. The antibody has been reported to stimulate
lipogenesis, inhibit lipolysis, and activate receptor kinase by cross-linking receptor
molecules (29).

Author Manuscript

To explore the effect of 83-7 mAb in cancer cells, we pre-treated 83-7 mAb overnight before
treating with IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin in MCF-7L, T47D and TamR cells. As shown in
Figure 4A, 83-7 mAb did not induce receptor phosphorylation. In contrast, 83-7 mAb downregulated InsR and effectively blocked IGF-II and insulin-stimulated IGF1R/InsR, IRS,
AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). To study the biological effects of InsR,
anchorage independent growth assays showed that 83-7 mAb effectively inhibited insulinstimulated colony formation (Fig. 4B). Although 83-7mAb caused some InsR downregulation in the parental cells, there was little to minimal inhibitory effect of 83-7 mAb on
MCF-7L and T47D parental cells in terms of IGF-I, IGF-II or even insulin-stimulated
signaling and anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 4).

Inhibition of InsR was not effective in parental breast cancer cells due to the presence of
IGF1R/InsR hybrid receptors
To further explore why InsR inhibition was not effective in MCF-7L and T47D parental
cells, we used immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting to examine the ability of these cells
to express IGF1R/InsR hybrid receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that
IGF1R/InsR hybrid receptors are present in MCF-7L and T47D parental cells but not in
TamR cells because of their downregulation of IGF1R (Fig. 5A). As previously shown, S961
was not effective in parental cells. To inhibit IGF1R and hybrid receptors, we used
HuEM164 (also known as AVE1642), an anti-IGF1R mAb shown to specifically bind
IGF1R and result in its down-regulation (30). In the parental cells, insulin signaling was
more completely extinguished by the use of both IGF1R mAb and S961 (Fig. 5B and S5).

Author Manuscript

Similarly, when shIR transduced parental cells was treated with HuEM164, a synergistic
inhibitory effect was achieved, as measured by IGF1R/InsR, IRS, AKT and MAPK
phosphorylation. Unlike S961, down-regulation of InsR by HuEM164 however was able to
only partially block insulin-mediated signaling in parental cells (Fig. 5C and S6). The most
complete inhibition of ligand signaling was achieved by the combination of shIR#6 and
HuEM164.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

While the insulin/InsR signaling system is responsible for glucose homeostasis; it is also a
cellular growth factor. Metabolic syndrome associated with obesity and type II diabetes,
both states of relative insulin resistance resulting in hyperinsulinemia are associated with
cancer risk (31). Breast cancer patients who have these conditions are more likely to suffer
metastatic disease, disease recurrence, and mortality (32, 33). When a number of anti-IGF1R
mAbs trials failed to show benefits in cancer patients, one mechanistic explanation is the
presence of InsR acting as a compensatory pathway to IGF1R inhibition and IGF1R loss
(12). Our endocrine resistant model showed greater sensitivity towards insulin when IGF1R
expression level is lacking (Fig. 1). Other studies have also shown similar pattern in prostate
cancer and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in vivo, where InsR induces mitogenic
activities and compensates for IGF1R inhibition or resistance to anti-IGF1R (34, 35).

Author Manuscript

InsR exists in two isoforms: InsR-A and InsR-B due to alternative splicing of exon 11,
differing by 12 amino acids. Previous studies have shown that InsR-B tends to be a
metabolic receptor expressed in adult muscle, liver, and fat. InsR-B binds only insulin at
physiological concentrations. In contrast, InsR-A, a predominant isoform during fetal
development is commonpressed in cancer and binds with high affinity to insulin and IGF-II
(36, 37). Up-regulation of InsR-A has been reported in breast, ovarian, lung, colon cell lines
and/or human tumors and is thought to mediate tumorigenesis and survivor in response to
insulin and IGF-II (38–42). However, our endocrine-resistant model did not show an
increase in InsR-A/InsR-B ratio of mRNA level compared to parental cells (data not shown).
To date, antibodies have not been developed that can distinguish between levels of InsR
isoforms, thus the exact protein expression of isoforms is uncertain in cells. In tumors, the
data regarding the role of InsR-A are derived from mRNA levels detected by PCR.
Additional study is needed to determine if InsR-B has an important role in cancer biology.

In this study, we blocked InsR function by three different techniques: 1.) genetic knockdown
of InsR using lentiviral shRNA, 2.) competitively blocked of insulin binding to its receptor
by S961 and 3.) down-regulation of InsR without affecting insulin binding by a mAb. These
different techniques showed consistent results, inhibiting InsR was effective in the inhibition
of insulin-regulated signaling and growth in TamR breast cancer cells, but not in parental
cells. These data show that insulin signaling is important in endocrine resistant cells, but less
relevant to parental MCF-7L and T47D cells. The presence of IGF1R or hybrid receptors
and little of holo-InsR make insulin only a weak mitogen in parental cells. Similar functions
of insulin receptor have been described in an ER-negative model of mouse breast cancer
(43). In this system, InsR suppression was necessary to inhibit murine breast cancers in both
normal and hyper-insulinemic hosts. Importantly, we have shown that inhibitors, in addition
to genetic knockdown techniques, can function to disrupt cell growth but only in a subset of
breast cancers with diminished IGF1R levels.

Author Manuscript

The presence of IGF1R/InsR hybrid receptors allows cancer cells to expand their ligand
binding capacity (Fig. 5A). Insulin can still signal through the other available IGF1R
heterodimer upon InsR inhibition; likewise IGF-I may signal through InsR in a hybrid
confirmation suggesting single target inhibition of IGF1R or InsR is not sufficient to
suppress hybrid receptor signaling. However in TamR cells, where there is little IGF1R,
InsR becomes the predominant receptor driving insulin- (and IGF-II) stimulated growth.
Thus, InsR is an important target in TamR cells. Unfortunately, there is no reliable method to
quantify the level of hybrid receptors in cells or patient tumors making it difficult to predict
response to antibody-based therapy on only examining levels of receptor expression.
However, the use of broader range of receptor biochemical inhibition such a TKI may
provide a better therapeutic advantage.

Author Manuscript

The major concern about targeting InsR is the resulting disruption of glucose homeostasis in
normal tissues. Hyperglycemia can be managed by metformin, a commonly used drug for
type 2 diabetes that reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, circulating insulin level, and
stimulates glucose uptake in muscle independent of insulin (44, 45). However the ability of
metformin to directly affect cancer cell biology outside of modulating serum insulin levels is
not understood. While there are preclinical data suggesting that metformin has little effect in
models of non-diabetic rodent models (46), the clinical benefits of metformin in nondiabetic women with breast cancer awaits reporting of an adjuvant clinical trial where
women were assigned to receive metformin or placebo for five years after surgical therapy
for breast cancer (NCT01101438).

Author Manuscript

Thus, direct targeting of InsR would be a preferable strategy. Here we show that monoclonal
antibodies and a competitive peptide inhibitor have active against InsR, but there could have
significant metabolic effects in vivo. As noted the two isoforms of InsR provide a theoretical
strategy to only inhibit the cancer associated function of InsR signaling. If InsR-A specific
agents could be developed, then this would not perturb the metabolic functions of InsR-B in
normal tissues. Furthermore, disruption of estrogen receptor signaling in breast cancer has
been an extremely effective therapy despite the presence of this receptor in many normal
tissues. InsR inhibition might be tolerated with appropriate strategies to manage glucose
homeostasis.

In conclusion, we highlighted the role of InsR in breast cancer biology, especially in the
context of resistance to endocrine therapies in ER+ breast cancer cells. Thus InsR should not
be neglected as a cancer target. Whether InsR inhibition could overcome primary (de novo)
endocrine resistance or treat secondary (acquired) resistanceis not certain. Combination use
of metformin may address hyperglycemia condition resulted from InsR inhibition, however
additional efforts at developing InsR-A blocking agents are warranted.

Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells in 60 mm diameter dishes and allow to
equilibrate overnight. Full medium was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM) for 24
hours. Cells were then treated, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer
of 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10
mM sodium orthovanadate, and with complete proteases inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Protein
concentrations were measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).
Whole cell lysates (50 μg) were boiled in 5X Laemmli loading buffer, separated by 8% SDSPAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted according to manufacturer
guidelines. For Immunoprecipitation (IP), whole-cell lysates were incubated with either antiInsR antibody or mIgG overnight at 4°C. Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose bead slurry was added
into the samples and incubated for 4 hours at 4°C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer 5
times and boiled in 5X Laemmli loading buffer. Samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE,
transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted.
Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR

Cells were plated at a density of 15,000 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to attach
overnight. Full media were replaced and starved with SFM for 24 hours. After 5 or 6 days of
treatment, growth was assessed via MTT assay. Each well was added 60 μL of 5 mg/mL
thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide solution (MTT) from Sigma-Aldrich in SFM for 4 hours
at 37°C in dark. Media were aspirated and purple formazan crystals were lyzed with 500 μL
of solubilization solution (95% dimethylsulfoxide and 5% Improved MEM). Absorbance
was measured with a plate reader at 570 nm using a 650 nm differential filter to access
growth.
Anchorage-independent growth assay (soft agar)
A 1-mL layer of 0.8% SeaPlaque-agarose (bioWhittaker) in 1% FBS-containing growth
media was solidified into each well of a 6-well plate. The bottom layer was overlaid with
1mL of 0.5% top agar mixture for 15,000 cells per well with appropriate treatment. All
plates were incubated at 37°C. The number of colony formation was assessed on a light
microscope with an ocular grid. Only colonies exceeding two thirds of grid square were
scored. Five random fields were counted per well.

MCF-7L and T47D and their counter TamR cells were InsR knock-downed with lentiviral
shRNA (shIR#2, shIR#6) or plasmid control (shSrcb or pLKO.1). InsR protein and mRNA
expression levels were respectively determined using Western blot analyses as shown in
lentiviral transduced (A) MCF-7L and T47D cells and qRT-PCR as shown in (B) MCF-7L
and T47D cells. Cells were plated, serum started for 24 hours and treated with or without
10nM insulin for 15 minutes. Whole cell lysates were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE
and subjected for indicated immunoblotting analyses. For qRT-PCR analysis, total RNA was
collected from cells in full media. Data was normalized to housekeeping gene, GAPDH.
Results represent mean ± SD of triplicates from three independent experiments. (C) Cell
monolayer growth was determined using MTT assay. Transduced MCF-7L and TamR cells
were serum starved for 24 hours and treated with or without insulin for 5 days. (D)
Anchorage-independent growth of lentiviral transduced MCF-7L and T47D was measured
after 19 days and 25 days, respectively. Values were normalized to untreated group and were
represented in fold change (mean ± SD, n=3). Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
comparison was performed to identify significance among untreated versus treated groups
and shIR versus control groups. *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01.
