BACKGROUND. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and
toxicity of weekly bortezomib in the treatment of patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma.

METHODS. A total of 40 patients with multiple myeloma who had received either
1 or 2 previous treatment regimens were treated with bortezomib at a dose of
1.6 mg/m2 intravenously for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week without
treatment. Responses were measured using International Myeloma Working
Group criteria.

RESULTS. Twenty-two patients (55%; 95% confidence interval, 40%-70%) achieved
objective responses to treatment, with a median response duration of 16 months.
The median progression-free survival for all patients was 9.6 months, with a 1year progression-free survival rate of 39%. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival
rates were 75% and 51%, respectively. Weekly bortezomib was generally well tolerated; grade 3/4 (using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
[version 3.0]) neutropenia (13%), thrombocytopenia (20%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (13%), and neuropathy (10%) were experienced by a minority of patients.

CONCLUSIONS. In the current study, a schedule of weekly bortezomib was found
to be effective and well tolerated in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. Although the response rate and duration appear comparable to those
achieved with twice-weekly bortezomib, the relative efficacy of these 2 schedules
cannot be determined definitively on the basis of this phase 2 study. A weekly
schedule of bortezomib is a reasonable option for patients who have logistic difficulties receiving a twice-weekly schedule, and is an attractive schedule for
incorporation into combination regimens. Cancer 2008;113:765–71.  2008

ince its recent introduction, bortezomib has rapidly become an
integral part of the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. In patients who had previously received multiple standard
regimens, treatment with bortezomib produced an overall response
rate of 43% and resulted in improved survival when compared with
treatment with high-dose dexamethasone in a randomized phase 3
trial.1-3 The marked activity in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma has led to the ongoing evaluation of bortezomib as a component of first-line therapy.
Because the activity of bortezomib is based on reversible inhibition of the proteasome, the schedule of administration was investigated in preclinical and phase 1 studies. Preclinical studies

demonstrated that continuous inhibition of the proteasome led to intolerable cumulative toxicity.4 After
a single bortezomib injection, proteasome inhibition
was detectable within 1 hour and was lost within 48
hours. These 2 observations led to the twice-weekly
schedule of bortezomib in an attempt to maximize
the duration of proteasome inhibition while avoiding
the toxicity of continuous inhibition.5-7 After initial
phase 1 studies demonstrated activity, the twiceweekly schedule was developed for the treatment of
multiple myeloma.
In recent studies, several investigators have evaluated a weekly schedule of bortezomib in malignancies other than multiple myeloma. A phase 1 trial in
patients with refractory solid tumors identified a bortezomib dose of 1.6 mg/m2, given weekly for 4 of every 5 weeks, as the maximum tolerated dose.8 This
more convenient weekly schedule of bortezomib has
shown activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as
a variety of solid tumors. To our knowledge, no randomized comparisons of the efficacy and toxicity of
weekly versus twice-weekly bortezomib have been
completed. However, a randomized phase 2 trial
comparing weekly versus twice-weekly bortezomib
(both administered with rituximab) in patients with
recurrent/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been reported.9 In this trial, the response
rate and progression-free survival of the 2 regimens
were similar, and the weekly bortezomib schedule
was associated with less toxicity.9
In this multicenter, community-based phase 2
trial, we evaluated a weekly bortezomib schedule in
patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients with no response to weekly bortezomib were allowed to crossover to the standard twiceweekly schedule. We present the results of this phase
2 study after a median follow-up of 24 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enrollment to this phase 2 trial was initiated in May
2004. This trial was performed in the Minnie Pearl
Cancer Research Network, a collaborative community-based clinical trials group (Table 1).

Eligibility
Patients with multiple myeloma who had received either 1 or 2 previous treatment regimens were eligible
for this trial. If patients had received previous highdose therapy, this treatment must have been a part
of first-line treatment; these patients may have
received only 1 previous regimen. Additional eligibility requirements included an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1,

or 2; measurable or evaluable disease; leukocyte
count 3000/lL; neutrophil count 1000/lL; platelet
count 75,000/lL; and serum creatinine <2.0 mg/dL
(or a calculated or measured creatinine clearance
>30 mL/minute). Patients previously treated with
bortezomib were ineligible. Additional exclusion criteria included peripheral neuropathy > grade 1,
other active malignancies, and other medical conditions that would interfere with trial participation. All
patients were required to provide written informed
consent before participating in this clinical trial. This
trial was approved at the Tri-Star Institutional Review
Board and by the institutional review boards at all
participating sites.

Pretreatment Evaluation
Before enrolling in this trial, all patients were evaluated with a complete history and physical examination (including neurologic examination), complete
blood counts and differential, chemistry profile, serum b2–microglobulin level, serum or urine electrophoresis, quantitative immunoglobulins, and metastatic bone survey. Patients underwent bone marrow
aspiration/biopsy unless previous bone marrow examination had demonstrated myeloma involvement
and response to bortezomib treatment was assessable by other studies. Women of childbearing potential had a pregnancy test before the initiation of
treatment with bortezomib.
Treatment
All patients received bortezomib at a dose of 1.6 mg/m2
by intravenous bolus for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week without treatment. A single treatment cycle was therefore considered to be of
5 weeks’ duration. Treatment was continued until tumor progression occurred, 10 cycles (50 weeks) were
completed, or unacceptable toxicity developed.
Antiemetic prophylaxis with each dose of bortezomib
was at the discretion of the treating physician. No
other routine premedication was administered.

Weekly Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma/Hainsworth et al

Dose Modifications
Modifications in bortezomib dosing were based on
clinical assessment and blood counts determined on
each day of scheduled treatment. Patients with a
neutrophil count 750/lL and platelet count
50,000/lL received a full dose of bortezomib. If the
blood counts were below these levels, the bortezomib
dose was held for 1 week and blood counts were
remeasured. If counts had risen above minimum
levels, bortezomib dosing was resumed at 75% of the
initial dose. If hematologic toxicity recurred with the
75% dose, bortezomib was continued at 50% of the
original dose. Bortezomib was discontinued if unacceptable myelosuppression recurred after 2 dose
reductions, or if blood counts failed to return to minimum levels after a 2-week delay.
Peripheral neuropathy was also monitored closely during this study; neurologic examinations were
performed by the treating physician every 5 weeks.
Patients with grade 2 sensory neuropathy or neuropathic pain had a 25% dose reduction in bortezomib.
If grade 3 neuropathy developed, bortezomib dosing
was discontinued until the neuropathy improved to
grade 1; bortezomib was then reinstituted at a 50%
dose. If grade 4 peripheral neuropathy developed at
any time, bortezomib was discontinued.
Patients experiencing reversible grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity had bortezomib dosing discontinued until the toxicity had improved to  grade 1;
at that time bortezomib was reinstituted at a 75%
dose. If grade 3/4 toxicity recurred, a second dose
reduction (to 50% of original dose) was allowed after
the toxicity had improved to  grade 1. If grade 3/4
toxicity recurred after 2 dose reductions or failed to
improve to  grade 1 after a delay of 3 weeks in dosing, bortezomib was discontinued.
Assessment of Treatment Effect
During therapy with bortezomib, patients were reassessed with complete blood counts, chemistry profile, serum b2-microglobulin, serum (or urine)
electrophoresis, and quantitative immunoglobulins
after each course (5 weeks) of therapy. Patients with
obvious symptomatic disease progression and laboratory evidence of progression were removed from
treatment after 5 weeks (1 cycle). Patients who were
stable after 5 weeks continued to another course of
bortezomib and were re-evaluated at 10 weeks. At
that time, all patients were assigned a response category using the International Myeloma Working
(IMW) Group Uniform Response Criteria.10 After the
re-evaluation at 10 weeks, patients with objective
response or stable disease with improved symptoms
continued weekly bortezomib treatment until my-

767

eloma progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.
Patients with disease progression or those with stable
disease who failed to demonstrate symptomatic
improvement were recommended to proceed with
bortezomib at a standard twice-weekly dosing schedule (1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day
cycle). However, this change in schedule was at the
discretion of the physician, and if further bortezomib
was believed to be unlikely to be of benefit patients
could be removed from study and treated with other
regimens.

Statistical Analysis
This nonrandomized phase 2 study was performed to
evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a weekly schedule of bortezomib in patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma. A secondary objective was to
assess the efficacy of a standard twice-weekly bortezomib schedule in patients who failed to respond to
weekly bortezomib.
Previous trials of twice-weekly bortezomib in
patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma
have produced objective response rates of 35% to
43%. Therefore, in this trial a similar response rate
was expected. Given our hypothesis that a weekly
schedule will be of approximately the same efficacy
as a twice-weekly schedule, the accrual of 40 patients
to this trial would allow a response rate to be
obtained within 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
of 7%, and also would allow adequate assessment
of the toxicity of this treatment schedule.
In the current study, progression-free survival
was defined as the time from the date of study entry
until the date that myeloma progression was documented. Overall survival was measured from the date
of study entry until the date of death. Survival curves
were constructed using the method of Kaplan and
Meier.11 All patients who received at least 1 dose of
bortezomib were evaluated for toxicity using the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between May 2004 and March 2006, 40 patients were
enrolled in this clinical trial by 10 participating sites
in the Minnie Pearl Cancer Research Network.
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 2.
The median age of these patients was 69 years and
the majority had good performance status (ECOG 0

untreated patient entered this trial; although clearly
ineligible by protocol inclusion criteria, he was
included in the efficacy and toxicity analyses.
Twenty-two of 39 patients (56%) had achieved at
least 1 objective response to previous treatment. Fifteen patients (38%) had developed disease progression during or within 3 months of the most recent
previous treatment regimen. The median duration of
first remission in these patients was 8 months. Common previous treatment modalities included corticosteroids (95%), alkylating agents (50%), thalidomide/
lenalidomide (48%), vinca alkaloids (33%), and
anthracyclines (30%). Only 2 patients (5%) had previously been treated with high-dose therapy and peripheral stem cell support.

Treatment Received
Thirty-five patients (88%) received at least 2 cycles
(10 weeks) of weekly bortezomib and were evaluated
for response. Two additional patients had rapid myeloma progression before completing 10 weeks of
treatment and were included as nonresponders.
Three other patients were removed from therapy
before the completion of 10 weeks of treatment and
are also included as nonresponders (treatmentrelated toxicity [grade 3 fatigue and diarrhea] in

1 patient and intercurrent illness in 2 patients [myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident]). The
median number of treatment courses received was 5
(range, 1-10 treatment courses). Twenty-nine patients
continued bortezomib after the first evaluation at
10 weeks. Eight of these patients went on to complete 10 cycles (50 weeks) of treatment, whereas 21
discontinued treatment for the following reasons:
disease progression in 11 patients, treatment-related
toxicity in 6 patients, poor compliance in 2 patients,
and physician decision in 2 patients. At the time of
last follow–up, no patient remained on bortezomib
therapy.
Eight patients had stable myeloma after completing 2 courses (10 weeks) of weekly bortezomib, and
were crossed over to treatment with a standard
twice-weekly bortezomib schedule. These 8 patients
received a median of 4 courses (range, 1-8 courses)
of twice–weekly bortezomib after crossover.

Efficacy
Twenty-two of 40 patients who entered this trial
(55%; 95% CI, 40%-70%) had objective responses to
treatment with weekly bortezomib. Two patients (5%)
achieved complete responses and 20 patients (50%)
had partial responses. Six of the 20 partial responders
had paraprotein decreases of 80% to 89%, but none
met International Myeloma Working Group criteria
for very good partial response (ie, >90% decrease).
Twelve patients (30%) had stable disease as their best
response to treatment, whereas 6 patients (15%) had
progressive disease or failed to receive 10 weeks of
treatment. The median duration of remission in
patients with an objective response was 16 months
(range, 4-35 months).
Eight patients who were stable after 10 weeks of
weekly bortezomib subsequently received bortezomib by the standard twice-weekly dosing schedule.
Four of these patients (50%) achieved partial
responses (range of duration, 6-29 months), whereas
4 patients had stable disease for a median of
12 months (range, 4-27 months). Because slow
responses are well documented in patients receiving
bortezomib by standard schedule, the significance of
these responses is difficult to assess. No patients
with overt progression of myeloma while receiving
weekly bortezomib were crossed over to the twiceweekly schedule.
The median time to treatment failure for the
entire group of patients was 9.6 months (95% CI, 5.512 months), with 39% of patients free of disease progression at 1 year (Fig. 1). The median survival for
the entire group had not been reached after a median follow-up of 24 months; the predicted 1-year

and 2-year survival rates are 75% and 51%, respectively (Fig. 2).

Treatment-related Toxicity
Treatment-related toxicity with weekly bortezomib is
summarized in Table 3. For most patients, weekly
bortezomib was well tolerated, with only a few severe
toxicities observed. Myelosuppression was mild with
this schedule, and did not result in any infectious
complications.
The nonhematologic toxicities observed with
weekly bortezomib included the same toxicities that
have previously been reported with the twice-weekly
schedule. Severe (grade 3) fatigue occurred in
6 patients (15%) and was generally reversible with a
treatment break from bortezomib. Four patients
(10%) developed grade 3 neuropathy. All of these

patients had received at least 4 courses of weekly
bortezomib at the time neuropathy developed.
Although bortezomib therapy was reinitiated in 2 of
these 4 patients after a short treatment delay, eventually all 4 patients were forced to discontinue bortezomib due to neuropathy (a fifth patient discontinued bortezomib when grade 3 neuropathy
developed after crossing over to the standard twiceweekly bortezomib schedule). Seven additional
patients (23%) developed grade 2 neuropathy
(painful neuropathy in 3 patients) after a median of
15 weeks of bortezomib therapy. Six of these patients
were able to continue bortezomib (3 with dose
reductions) without further worsening of neuropathy,
whereas 1 patient discontinued bortezomib.
During treatment, a total of 6 patients (15%)
required reductions in the dose of bortezomib. Six
patients (15%) discontinued weekly bortezomib due
to toxicity (grade 3 neuropathy in 4 patients, grade 3
diarrhea/grade 2 neuropathy in 1 patient, and grade
3 diarrhea/fatigue in 1 patient). There were no treatment-related deaths reported in this clinical trial.

DISCUSSION
During the last several years, bortezomib has been
rapidly incorporated into the standard treatment of

multiple myeloma. Although originally approved for
use as a single agent in previously treated patients,
major emphasis currently focuses on the development of bortezomib-containing combination regimens for use as first-line therapy.12-17 In the
treatment of multiple myeloma, bortezomib continues to be administered by the twice-weekly schedule originally developed on the basis of
pharmacodynamic considerations and preclinical
data.4-6 More recently, the administration of a more
convenient weekly bortezomib schedule demonstrated activity and suggested better tolerability in
other tumor types.8,9 However, to our knowledge
only very limited experience exists in using weekly
bortezomib in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.
In this nonrandomized, multicenter phase 2 trial,
we documented a response rate of 55% (95% CI,
40%-70%) in a group of 40 patients with recurrent/
refractory multiple myeloma who were treated with
weekly bortezomib. The median response duration in
patients with objective response was 16 months; progression-free survival for the entire group was 9.6
months, with a 1-year progression-free survival rate
of 39%. These efficacy parameters are similar to
those reported in the pivotal trial using a twiceweekly bortezomib schedule (Table 4).1-3 However,
comparison of efficacy in various reported studies is
difficult due to variations in patient characteristics.
For example, our patients were a median 8 years
older but had received less previous treatment
(including high–dose therapy) than patients in the
pivotal bortezomib study.1-3

Weekly bortezomib was generally well tolerated,
with no unanticipated toxicity noted to develop
in these patients with previously treated multiple
myeloma. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 13% and 26% of patients, respectively, but only 1 patient required hospitalization for
neutropenic fever. Grade 3 neuropathy developed in
4 patients (10%); all of these patients had received
at least 4 courses (20 weeks) of bortezomib when
neuropathy developed. Two of the 4 patients were
able to resume bortezomib after a short treatment
break, whereas 2 required discontinuation of therapy. An additional 9 patients (23%) developed grade
2 neuropathy, similar to the incidence reported with
the standard schedule. Other severe nonhematologic
toxicity was uncommon. Overall, the spectrum and
incidence of toxicity in this trial are similar to toxicities reported in multiple myeloma patients treated
with the standard twice-weekly dosing schedule
(Table 4).
In 1 other small trial, 29 patients received weekly
bortezomib (at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2) and methylprednisolone (at a dose of 500-2000 mg intravenously) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.18 The
majority of patients (70%) had received previous
high-dose therapy, and most had received at least 2
previous regimens. In this group, a 62% overall
response rate was achieved, with a median time-todisease progression of 6.6 months. These efficacy
results were believed to be similar to those previously reported with single-agent bortezomib on a
twice-weekly schedule, and are also similar to the
results achieved in our multicenter trial.
A small amount of experience with weekly bortezomib also exists in the treatment of patients with
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In a randomized phase 2
trial, weekly bortezomib was compared with the
standard twice-weekly schedule; rituximab was
included in both treatment regimens.9,19 Although
the inclusion of rituximab precludes the evaluation
of bortezomib efficacy, bortezomib-related side
effects, particularly myelosuppression, were less
common with the weekly bortezomib schedule. However, less favorable results with weekly bortezomib in
patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma were recently
reported by O’Connor et al.20 In an ongoing trial of
weekly bortezomib (at a dose of 1.8 mg/m2 weekly
for 4 of 6 consecutive weeks), only 2 of the first
18 patients (11%) achieved partial responses. This
early response rate was lower than previously
achieved by these investigators using a twice-weekly
bortezomib schedule21; the somewhat lower dose intensity of bortezomib given by the weekly schedule
was raised as a possible explanation.

Weekly Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma/Hainsworth et al

In summary, our phase 2 study provides additional evidence that the weekly bortezomib schedule
is active and well tolerated in the treatment of
patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma.
In this trial (which included patients with a higher
median age), the toxicity encountered was similar to
that reported with the standard twice-weekly schedule. However, accumulated evidence from several
trials suggests the frequency of grade 3 of 4 toxicities
is somewhat decreased with the weekly schedule.
Differences in toxicity may be schedule-related, or
may be simply related to the slightly lower dose intensity of bortezomib administered with most weekly
schedules (average weekly dose of 1.73 mg/m2 with
the standard schedule vs 1.28 mg/m2 with the weekly
schedule in the current study). Although the efficacy
of the weekly and twice-weekly bortezomib schedules in patients with previously treated multiple
myeloma appears to be similar, comparative trials
are required to better define this issue, and existing
data are not sufficient to justify the routine use of a
weekly bortezomib schedule. However, this schedule
has sufficient activity to be used as an alternative
for patients who have logistic difficulties in receiving twice-weekly treatment. In addition, the weekly
schedule may provide a more convenient and bettertolerated option for the development of bortezomibcontaining combination regimens.
