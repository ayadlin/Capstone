Abstract
Clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTC) exhibit more
robust metastatic properties than single CTC. Thus, understanding the distinct behaviors of CTC clusters and how CTC
clustering is regulated may offer new insights into how to limit
metastasis. In this study, we utilized an in vivo confocal system
to observe the clustering behavior of CTC in real time, ﬁnding
that the number of clusters increased proportionally with the
growth of the primary tumor. Our experiments also indicated
that the ﬂow rate of the CTC clusters in blood vessels was
relatively slower than single CTC due to increased vessel wall
adhesion. Depending on disease stage, 5% to 10% of total CTC

in circulation were in clusters, with this proportion increasing
to >24% within lung metastases examined. Notably, in the
4T1 mouse model of breast cancer metastasis, we found that
injecting host animals with urokinase-type plasminogen activator, a clinical thrombolytic agent, was effective at preventing
the assembly of CTC clusters and prolonging overall host
survival by approximately 20% relative to control animals.
Our results suggest a tractable approach to limit metastasis
by suppressing the formation or stability of CTC clusters
circulating in the blood of cancer patients. Cancer Res; 75(21);

Introduction

the disease (1–3). Interestingly, the presence of CTC clusters as
well as single CTCs in the bloodstream has been frequently
reported, while it has been conﬁrmed that CTCs form clusters in
circulatory areas (4), and particularly around primary tumors (5).
The number of CTC clusters is associated with clinically important factors such as the release of cancer cells from primary tumors
and the response to chemotherapy. In addition, in previous
studies in which an animal model with Lewis carcinoma and
melanoma cells was used, tumor-cell aggregates disproportionately generated more lung colonies than equivalent numbers of
single cells after tail-vein injections (6, 7), and the yield of
spontaneous metastases was inﬂuenced by the release of clumps
from ﬁbrosarcomas (7). It is therefore of great interest that the
release of cancer clumps is a parameter that is quantitatively
related to the overall prognosis of spontaneous metastases.
Molnar and colleagues isolated CTC clusters by using magnetic
labeling and suggested that a signiﬁcant correlation exists between
the number of clusters and the survival outcome of patients with
colon cancer (4). Studies that used metastatic cancer cell lines
revealed that many CTCs exist as clumps in blood vessels, and
although the number of clumps varied widely between individuals, it seemed to be highly correlated to the extent of lung
colonization (8). Furthermore, the research demonstrated that the
number of CTC clusters in the circulatory system can directly
predict the degree of disease progression for breast cancer.
Recently, a variety of methods and devices have been developed
to detect CTCs (9, 10); for example, microﬂuidic assay is an
effective way to count and sort those CTCs in the peripheral
blood (11), while the immunomagnetic cell-separation technique can also be applied to isolate cells of a speciﬁc lineage
from a variety of other immune-cell types in the blood (12). Aceto
and colleagues utilized new technology platforms such as the

In primary tumors, the capacity of the majority of cells means
that they cannot metastasize into other organs. Only a limited
number of primary tumor cells become the circulating tumor cells
(CTC) that subsequently invade a patient's blood vessels, leading
to the ultimate dissemination of such cells into the secondary
organs. An increase of the number of CTCs generally means a
greater likelihood of a poor survival outcome. For this reason,
CTC detection has emerged as a useful practice to predict the
emergence of cancer metastases and describe the progression of

Antimetastatic Effect by Targeting CTC Cluster

Herringbone HBCTC-Chip and negCTC-iChip to isolate and
observe individual CTCs and CTC clusters (13, 14). They revealed
that CTC clusters originate from oligoclonal aggregates, which are
released from primary tumor cells and are more metastatic than
equivalent numbers of single CTCs. Although CTC clusters are rare,
their signiﬁcance means that the cells they are composed of must be
managed carefully during cancer treatment. However, even though
these studies revealed the importance of CTCs and CTC clusters, the
corresponding experiments provided only cross-sectional information on their behavior and properties without detailing the corresponding spatiotemporal dynamics. For example, important
questions about the associative dynamics of CTCs that underpin
cluster formation or the dissociation of CTCs from such clusters
remained largely unresolved. On the basis of the real-time behavior
of CTCs and CTC clusters in blood vessels, we believe that the
methods for ex vivo–prepared samples may have an internal
limitation regarding the dissection of CTCs and CTC clusters.
As CTC clusters, which coexist with single CTCs in the bloodstream of cancer patients, represent a more critical prognostic or
predictive factor of the metastatic process than single circulating
cells (5), a better understanding of CTC cluster formation is
urgently required to treat cancer and protect against metastasis.
Live-imaging–based experiments are considered the most robust
method for addressing this problem (15, 16). The use of ﬂuorescent proteins and other developments in optical-imaging technology have made it possible to directly observe cancer cells as
they spread from their original site (17). To track the motility of
ﬂuorescently labeled target cells, confocal systems that operate on
a millisecond time scale are particularly useful (18, 19). In this
study, we used intravital, confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy to
describe the hidden behaviors of CTC clusters in comparison with
those of single CTCs. By analyzing the characteristics of CTC
clusters, we conﬁrmed a hypothesis about the crucial involvement
of CTC clusters in metastasis; furthermore, we investigated the
inhibitory effect of urokinase on ﬁbrin in the CTC clusters, thereby
uncovering potential pharmacologic routes for the suppression of
CTC clustering.

Materials and Methods
Cell and chemical preparation
Murine mammalian carcinoma cell lines 4T1, B16, and B16F10
were purchased from Korea Cell Bank. The cells were cultured in a
RPMI-1649 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1%
penicillin, and streptomycin (10,000 U/mL). To produce cells that
stably expressed GFP or RFP, lentiviral GFP and RFP vectors were
transduced into 4T1 cells, and 100 mg/mL of G418 was added
every other day for 4 weeks to selectively kill the cells without GFP
or RFP expression. The colonies were isolated and cultured for
another 2 weeks to preserve those cells with a homogeneous
genetic background. Paclitaxel and urokinase were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animal experiments and optical imaging
All of the animal experiments were performed in compliance
with institutional guidelines and were approved by the subcommittee on research-animal care at Wonkwang University, South
Korea. Both ﬂanks of each mouse were injected with 5  105 cells
of pure GFP4T1 and RFP4T1 cell lines or mixtures of GFP4T1 and
RFP4T1 cell lines. The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (90 mg per kg of body weight) and

www.aacrjournals.org

xylazine (9 mg per kg of body weight) before imaging. Scissors
were used to make small incisions around the tumors. The mice
were placed on the heated plate of a motorized XYZ translational
stage. For vasculature imaging, tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)
dextran conjugates (5 mg/mL, 2,000,000 MW; Invitrogen) were
injected intravenously; the images were typically acquired within
5 to 40 minutes after the injection. GFP-expressing cells were
visualized at an excitation wavelength of 491 nm and detected
through a bandpass ﬁlter of 502 nm to 537 nm (Semrock).
TAMRA- and RFP-expressing cells were imaged at an excitation
wavelength of 532 nm and detected using a bandpass ﬁlter of 562
nm to 596 nm (Semrock).
Urokinase was treated three times a week at 100 U in 100 mL for
4 to 5 weeks.
CTC isolation from blood
After the mice were anesthetized, a cardiac puncture was
performed. Between 500 mL and 700 mL of the whole blood was
collected. After centrifugation, the pellet was incubated with the
RBC lysis buffer. The solution containing CTCs was ﬁltered
through a strainer of 40 mm mesh size (Corning Life). The cells
that remained on the strainer were resuspended in 500 mL of the
RPMI culture medium, whereas the rest of the fraction that ﬂowed
through the strainer was gently centrifuged again and resuspended
in 1 mL of the RPMI. The GFP- and RFP-expressing cells were
counted using ﬂuorescence and bright-ﬁeld microscopy.

Results
Visualization of CTCs in peritumoral regions
Blood samples from patients with breast cancer were used to
conﬁrm the existence of a CTC cluster and the heterogeneity of
cells in the cluster. To detect CTC with a high speciﬁcity and
sensitivity, we administrated hTERT-promoter-coding adenoviral
vector into blood samples (20–23). GFP was speciﬁcally
expressed in the CTCs (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). Also,
the coexistence of CD45-positive cells—presumably acting as
hematopoietic cells—in the CTC clusters was conﬁrmed (Fig. 2B).
To visualize CTCs in blood vessels and evaluate the meaning of
the number of CTCs in peritumoral regions, GFP-expressing B16
and B16F10 cells were injected into both ﬂanks of each of the test
mice; the latter line is a more metastatic subline derived from B16.
The injected cells gradually led to the emergence of visible tumors.
At the 5-week mark following the inoculation of the tumor cells,
we used intravital, confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy to look at the
peritumoral vessels after ﬁrst making small incisions in the tumor
area (Fig. 1C and D). As it is well known that the number of CTCs
correlates to the severity of the disease, we compared the number
of CTCs from GFP-expressing B16 and B16F10 cells in similar
vessels (50–100 mm in diameter) to verify whether the number of
CTCs in the peritumoral regions can also be as clinically meaningful as their number in circulation; there were comparatively
more B16F10 CTCs than B16 CTCs in such regions (Supplementary Fig. S2A, left, and B). Furthermore, we sought to determine
whether treatment with an anticancer drug can affect the number
of CTCs. The application of paclitaxel, which had previously been
effective for melanomas (24, 25), twice a week for 2 weeks led to a
signiﬁcant decrease in the number of CTCs (Fig. S2A, right, and B).
These observations conﬁrmed that, similar to the number of CTCs
in circulation, the number of peritumoral CTCs seemed to accurately reﬂect the metastatic potential of primary tumors.

In vivo monitoring of CTC clusters
Interestingly, we occasionally observed clustered cells in
peripheral vessels and the numerous GFP-negative cells seemed
to be mingled within the CTC cluster (Fig. 1B). To assess the
number of CTCs in clusters as a fraction of the total CTC count,
movie records were used to count the cells on a weekly basis
(Fig. 2A). Although the number of CTCs ﬂuctuated every week, the
average CTC count gradually increased as the tumors grew in size
during the 5 weeks after the injection of the B16 and B16F10 cells
(n ¼ 5). The number of CTCs found in clusters also increased;
however, they were consistently 5- to 10-fold less abundant than
the single CTCs (Fig. 2B).
To conﬁrm the number of CTCs that was counted with live
confocal imaging in the peritumoral regions, we compared this
number with the number of CTCs obtained from the whole blood.
Red ﬂuorescent protein (RFP)-expressing 4T1 cells were used for
this purpose and the previously described method was again used.
To distinguish the number of cluster CTCs from the total CTC
count, we ﬁltered 500 mL of blood with a strainer after the lysis of
the red blood cells (RBCs; Fig. 2C). Most of the single cells,

4476 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

including the blood cells and individual CTCs, ﬂowed through
the ﬁlter and remained in the throttle bottle (Fig. 2C). The CTC
clusters were predominantly contained and, to a lesser extent,
some CTCs and immune cells were also caught on the strainer
sieves (Fig. 2D, top). As the CTCs expressed RFP and their size was
somewhat larger than those of other peripheral blood monocyte
cells (PBMCs), they were easily distinguished from other cells. As a
result, the number of CTCs increased in correspondence with the
tumor size and the CTC clusters were much less numerous
compared with the single CTCs. We found that the ratio between
the clusters and single CTCs was in the range of 1/5 to 1/10; that is,
similar to that observed in the in vivo confocal microscopy experiments (Fig. 2E). Considering the data illustrated in Fig. 2, we
concluded that the number of CTC clusters detected in the
peritumoral region was small but was nonetheless meaningfully
correlated to the number of CTC clusters in circulation.
Characterization of CTC cluster viscosity and assembly
When the CTC clusters were monitored in real time in a 250-mm
width area, they ﬂowed more slowly than the single CTCs, and

some of them seemed almost static on the vessel surface around
the tumors. We sought to make an accurate comparison of the
ﬂow-velocity values using both the single and clustered CTCs and
found that the average ﬂow speed of the single CTCs was approximately 380 mm/s, which is a little slower than the ﬂow of the GFPnegative PBMCs (420 mm/second); the ﬂow rate of the CTC
clusters was approximately 50 mm/second (Fig. 3A and B). The
similar pattern was observed in an orthotopic animal model with
mammary fat pad (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Movie S1). The
ﬂow rate of the CTC cluster seems to be 10 times slower than single
CTCs (Fig. 3D). The clusters slowly rolled within the vessel lumen
while the ﬂowing single CTCs became attached to the CTC clusters
that were previously formed (Fig. 3E). Therefore, in a case wherein
CTC clusters exhibit a comparatively slow speed, their adhesiveness and attachment to vessel walls may be the cause; occasionally, we also observed the GFP-positive tumor cells detach from

the clusters. As we have shown in continuously recorded frames
(Fig. 3E and Supplementary Movie S2), the CTC clusters exhibited
dynamic compositional changes, as individual CTCs could repeatedly associate with and dissociate from the clusters (Fig. 3E).
High metastatic potential of CTCs
To assess differences in the abilities of the single CTCs and CTC
clusters to metastasize into secondary organs, their metastatic
capacities to invade lung tissue were analyzed in an animal model.
First, we selected GFP- and RFP-4T1 cells with similar tumorigenic
and metastatic activities (Supplementary Fig. S3). In one experimental group, the GFP- and RFP-4T1 cells were separately
injected into the opposite ﬂanks of each of the test mice
(Fig. 4A and B). In another group, mixtures of GFP-4T1 and
RFP-4T1 cells were injected into both ﬂanks, with each side
receiving approximately the same number of cells (Fig. 4C and

D). Five weeks after the inoculation, the mice's lungs were
dissected and analyzed (Fig. 4E). We found comparable numbers of metastasized nodules in the experimental groups, implying the similar metastatic potentials of GFP- and RFP-4T1 cells
(Fig. 4E). The nodules from each group were examined using a
confocal microscope to observe the composition of the metastasized cells. We dissected 100 nodules from 7 mice in each
group. Eleven to 16 nodules from each mouse were randomly
selected based on the nodule size. When we observed each
nodule under a confocal microscope, the nodules could be
divided into the following three groups according to their
ﬂuorescent colors: nodules expressing exclusively GFP or RFP,
and nodules simultaneously expressing both ﬂuorescent proteins. The number of nodules in each category was counted and
the totals were compared between the experimental groups
(Supplementary Table S1). In the mice that received separate
injections of GFP- and RFP-tagged cells, 46% of the nodules
expressed only GFP and another 50% expressed only RFP; the
remaining 4% of nodules contained a mixture of GFP and RFP

4478 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

colors (Fig. 4G and H, left bar). In the mice that were injected
with mixtures of GFP- and RFP-tagged cells, the fractions of
single-color nodules were slightly decreased compared with the
mice that received separate injections of pure-cell populations.
In the mixture-injected mice, the GFP- and RFP-containing
nodules were measured at 43% and 45%, respectively. Consequently, the fraction of nodules containing both GFP- and RFPpositive cells increased to 12% (Fig. 4H). A difference of 8% in
the fraction of nodules with mixed GFP- and RFP-positive cells
was therefore identiﬁed between the ﬁrst and second experimental groups. It is likely that every nodule of a uniform color
was derived from a single site that the CTCs initially inﬁltrated;
although, according to our observations, 8% of the nodules
potentially originated from the mixed CTC clusters. Furthermore, even in those nodules that expressed only GFP or RFP, the
same 8% probability regarding the coexistence of same-colored
cells from different clusters could be expected, as previously
mentioned. The nodules that emerged from the CTC clusters
may therefore account for as much as 24% (¼ 3  8%) of all of

the nodules that were observed. Our ﬁnding, whereby the GFPand RFP-mixed nodules occurred more frequently in those
animals that were injected with mixtures of GFP- and RFPpositive cells, indicates that clusters mainly form around primary tumors and not during circulation.
Effect of urokinase on CTC clusters
Fibrin is considered to be an inducer of CTC clustering (26, 27);
therefore, we sought to determine whether urokinase, a thrombolytic agent that dissolves ﬁbrin, suppresses the clustering of
CTCs in vitro and affects metastasis in vivo. We observed a reduction in the number of CTC clusters on the sieves after an in vitro
incubation with 0.2 mg/mL urokinase for 10 minutes (Fig. 5A). In
vivo treatment with 100 U of urokinase decreased the number of
CTC clusters in the blood of treated mice compared with the
numbers in the control, untreated animals, whereas the number
of single CTCs was not affected (Fig. 5B and C); in vivo confocalmicroscopy–based observations of the areas around the tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

showed the reproduction of this pattern (Fig. 5E and F). Collectively, these results suggest that urokinase directly breaks down
CTC clusters into single CTCs.
To conﬁrm the inhibitory effect of urokinase on CTC clustering in vivo, cell mixtures containing 50% GFP-positive and 50%
RFP-positive 4T1 cells were injected into both ﬂanks of each of
the mice, as described in the experiments that are depicted in Fig.
4C, followed by the administration of urokinase once or twice a
week for 3 weeks after the inoculation. The treatment with
urokinase did not affect the growth of primary tumors
(Fig. 5F); however, the thrombolytic agent seemed to reduce
metastasis (Fig. 5H). We used confocal microscopy to analyze
the color composition of the metastasized nodules. Each nodule
was again assigned to one of the three groups based on the
ﬂuorescent colors that it expressed. Interestingly, the population
of nodules that comprised both GFP- and RFP-tagged cells
decreased from 13% to 5% after the urokinase treatment (Fig.
5I). The change of this proportion was statistically signiﬁcant

Antimetastatic Effect by Targeting CTC Cluster

(P ¼ 0.035) in accordance with the Fisher exact test; also, the
ratio between the nodules that exclusively expressed RFP or GFP
was preserved (Fig. 5I). Finally, to determine whether urokinase
can improve the survival of animals implanted with cancer cells,
we administered the mice with urokinase once or twice a week
for 3 weeks after the cell inoculation. The total survival periods
of the mice that were treated weekly were prolonged on average
by 5 to 6 days in low-dose and by 9 to 10 days in high-dose
group, thus the total survival periods of those urokinase-treated
mice were improved more signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) in comparison
with the untreated animal group. As the tumor cells were
implanted Week 7 and the death was initiated from Week 12,
it means the survival extension is more than 20% considering
the diagnosed time point and life span.

Discussion
Metastasis has fatal consequences for patients with cancer,
while CTCs are considered the "seeds" of metastasis. To spread
to distant organs, cancer cells need to enter the blood vasculature and become CTCs; this process is considered a critical
step in the metastatic process. Furthermore, the ﬂow of CTCs in
the bloodstream is the last step before they disseminate into a
secondary organ (1–3). Once metastasized, cancer becomes
more difﬁcult to treat, so the detection of CTCs can predict
clinical output, and may be used in the monitoring of the
efﬁcacy of pharmacologic interventions against metastases. In
addition, a number of CTCs can form a clump, also referred to
as a "cluster" in this manuscript. According to a general understanding, CTC clusters are directly responsible for metastases, as
they exhibit a higher metastatic property than individual CTCs.
Many tumor cells possess strong pro-coagulant properties that
promote the local activation of the coagulation system
(28–30). Tumor-mediated stimulation of coagulation has been
implicated in the formation of tumor stroma and the development of hematogenous metastasis (30–34).
As illustrated in Fig. 2, we observed the adherence of CTC
clusters to blood vessels. It was most likely that the clusters that
appeared to contain GFP-negative cells as well as GFP-positive
cells were composed of CTCs. Although platelets can be one of
the components of CTC clusters, it is plausible that the GFPnegative cells that we observed were actually macrophages
rather than platelets, as their diameter was 10 to 20 mm
(35), whereas a platelet's diameter is normally under 2 mm
(36, 37). Tumor-associated macrophages induce the formation
of CTC clusters around blood vessels near the tumor, establishing gradients of the EGF within the tumor environment; this
process can also lead to the attraction of tumor cells toward
blood vessels (38, 39).
Fibrinogen is likely to play an important role in the emergence
of CTC clumps. The majority of solid tumors in humans and
experimental animals contain considerable amounts of ﬁbrinogen-related products—mostly cross-linked ﬁbrin—suggesting
that ﬁbrin and ﬁbrinogen are important in tumorigenesis and
metastasis (40–44). Research has found that ﬁbronectin has also
been upregulated in several types of malignant tumors, and its
expression positively correlates to an invasive and metastatic
phenotype. Low-molecular weight (LMW) heparin directly leads
to ﬁbrin lysis, and patients treated with LMW heparin have a
signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt; however, research has still not conclusively veriﬁed if the antimetastatic effect of heparins and other

www.aacrjournals.org

antithrombotic agents is clinically beneﬁcial (45, 46). The ability
of thrombolytics such as urokinase to break cell aggregates is well
documented and this property is sometimes used to treat intravascular coagulation in cancer patients (47). The pharmacologic
mechanism-of-action of this drug targets cell-aggregation–promoting ﬁbrin. To decrease the number of CTC clusters, urokinase,
which can break down blood clots, was intravenously injected
into those mice that had previously developed lung cancer (Fig. 5),
and the injections successfully increased the survival rate of those
mice with lung cancer metastases; therefore, our ﬁndings demonstrate an ample therapeutic potential of the manipulations of
CTC clusters that could minimize cancer metastases. Moreover,
our data suggest that the antimetastatic effect of coagulation
inhibition may partially come from the disassembling of CTC
clusters. In a previous study, plakoglobin seemed to be a promising therapeutic drug for inhibiting the formation of CTC clusters
(5). As the antimetastatic effect of siRNA against plakoglobin
caused an inhibition of cell aggregation in circulation, the direct
manipulation of ﬁbrinogen may be another promising method to
control CTC clusters, in addition to the targeting of plakoglobin.
Improvements in optical-imaging techniques have now
enabled us to obtain far more precise observations of metastasizing cells, and confocal imaging of tumors that express
ﬂuorescent proteins enables researchers to conduct detailed
observations of cell motility. Although it is not easy to observe
a CTC cluster in circulation with a microscope, our intravital
imaging reliably detected CTC clusters that emerged near primary tumors. The development of the CTC clusters in the
peritumoral region was conﬁrmed by an analysis of the results
obtained from those cells expressing GFP, RFP, or a mixture of
both ﬂuorescent proteins (Fig. 4). Our calculations showed
results that are comparable with those obtained by Aceto and
colleagues in radiolabeled cells.
Therefore, while the previous studies on CTCs relied on the
isolation of such cells from the blood, our imaging-based observations helped us to directly understand the dynamics of CTCs
and the clustering process in blood vessels. This analysis on the
CTC cluster with the patients may give a beneﬁt to predict disease
progression. And the trial with in vivo or ex vivo screening system
that looks for an active intervention into CTC cluster formation
may lead a novel drug discovery for the treatment of cancer before
it starts disseminating into the secondary organs.
