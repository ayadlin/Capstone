BACKGROUND: The Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted this phase 2 trial to estimate the antitumor activity of bevacizumab
and to determine the nature and degree of toxicity in patients with recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary. METHODS: A prospective, multi-institutional cooperative group trial was performed in women with recurrent, measurable ovarian stromal tumors.
Patients were allowed to have unlimited prior therapy, excluding bevacizumab. Bevacizumab 15 mg=kg was administered intravenously on day 1 of every 21-day cycle until patients developed disease progression or adverse effects that prohibited further treatment. The primary endpoint was the response rate (RR). Inhibin A and B levels were measured before each cycle, and the values
were examined in relation to response and progression. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled, and all were eligible and evaluable. Patients received a median of 9 cycles of treatment (range, 2-37 cycles). Six patients (16.7%) had partial responses (90% confidence interval, 7.5%-30.3%), 28 patients (77.8%) had stable disease, and 2 patients (5.6%) had progressive disease. This met the
criterion for declaring the regimen active. The median progression-free survival was 9.3 months, and the median overall survival was
not reached in during reporting period. Two grade 4 toxicities occurred, including hypertension and proteinuria; and the most common grade 3 toxicities were hypertension (n 5 5) and pain (n 5 5). Inhibin A and B values were lower in patients who responded to
treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab has activity in the treatment of recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary, and its toxC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) of the ovary are rare neoplasms that account for less than 5% of all ovarian malignancies.1-3
This group of ovarian stromal tumors includes granulosa cell tumors, granulosa cell-theca cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors
(androblastomas), steroid (lipid) cell tumors, gynandroblastomas, unclassified sex cord-stromal tumors, and sex cord tumors
with annular tubules. SCSTs tend to have an indolent course compared with epithelial ovarian cancer and can recur decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these tumors are particularly resistant to chemotherapy, and treatment
of recurrent disease is difficult, even with the use of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal agents.4-6 Therefore,
the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches is warranted based on the limited efficacy of these standard treatment options.
The tumor biology of SCSTs suggests the importance of angiogenesis in tumor development and progression. These
tumors are known to be vascular and can present with hemoperitoneum in up to 30% of patients.5 Lymph node

metastases are extremely rare, yet distant metastases are
common, further suggesting that hematogenous spread
predominates and that angiogenesis may play an important role in these tumors.7,8 A recent case series of 8
patients who were treated at a single institution suggested
that bevacizumab is active in the setting of recurrent disease, but the study included multiple regimens with and
without cytotoxic therapy and was retrospective in nature.
That report also suggested that vascular endothelial
growth factor overexpression and microvessel density
were associated with worse outcomes and a more aggressive phenotype, although the sample size was too small to
calculate statistical significance.8 Together, these observations suggest that antiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, may have a role in treating women with SCSTs.
However, the body of literature surrounding these characteristics is limited, and, to our knowledge, no prospective
study of any antiangiogenic agent in SCSTs has been performed to date.
Because SCSTs are uncommon, clinical trials
exploring therapeutic options have been limited. Performing these trials in a cooperative group setting, such as the
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), allows for rapid
accrual and evaluation. The primary objective of our
phase 2 study was to estimate the antitumor activity of
bevacizumab by assessing the frequency of objective
responses in patients who had recurrent SCSTs of the
ovary with measurable disease. The secondary objectives
were to examine overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) and to determine the nature and degree
of toxicity in these patients. A translational research objective was to determine the association of inhibin A and
inhibin B with response to treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

Eligible patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis
of recurrent ovarian stromal tumor, including granulosa
cell tumor, granulosa cell-theca cell tumor, Sertoli-Leydig
cell tumor (androblastoma), steroid (lipid) cell tumor,
gynandroblastoma, unclassified sex cord-stromal tumor,
or sex cord tumor with annular tubules. Because some
patients had experienced multiple episodes of recurrent
disease before enrolling in this protocol, any histologic
confirmation of recurrent SCST was considered sufficient
for enrollment, and a repeat biopsy was not mandated.
Central pathologic review confirmed the diagnosis of
ovarian SCST. Patients were eligible if they had measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Cancer

February 1, 2014

Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, version 1.1, defined as
at least 1 lesion that could be accurately measured in at
least 1 dimension (the greatest dimension to be recorded),
with each target lesion 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain radiograph, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance
imaging, or 10 mm when measured by spiral computed
tomography. Other eligibility criteria included a GOG
performance status of 0, 1, or 2; adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function; and patients of childbearing
potential with a negative pregnancy test had to agree to
practice an effective means of birth control. There were
no restrictions on prior therapy, but patients could not
have previously received bevacizumab.
Study Design

This GOG prospective, multi-institutional, phase 2 trial
was designed to estimate the antitumor activity of bevacizumab by assessing the frequency of objective response, to
examine OS and PFS, and to determine the nature and
degree of toxicity in these patients. Patients were to receive
bevacizumab intravenously at a dose of 15 mg=kg every
21 days until they developed disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Bevacizumab was provided by the manufacturer free of charge to the patients. Each 21-day period
was considered 1 cycle. Serum inhibin A and B levels were
measured during every cycle of treatment. The study
received local institutional review board approval at participating institutions, and all patients gave written
informed consent according to institutional and federal
guidelines before treatment.
Treatment Plan and Dose Modification

Toxicity was monitored with history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment before each treatment
cycle, with adverse events defined and graded according to
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Guidelines were established for dose delays and
dose reductions for hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicity.
Patient Assessment

Activity of bevacizumab was assessed according to
RECIST, either by clinical evaluation, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, at baseline and
before every other cycle for the measurement of target
lesions, the classification of clinical response, and the
determination of disease progression. Therapy was discontinued for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,

Statistical Analysis

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the study agent as assessed by objective tumor
responses. The tumor response rate (RR) was used as the
primary endpoint, rather than survival or PFS, for 2 reasons. First, there are limited prior data serving as a reference for PFS and OS in this disease setting, so these
endpoints cannot be used to define the activity of the
agent. Second, an objective response is 1 meaningful way
to assess antitumor activity, and setting a low threshold
for tumor response (5%) enabled us to have reasonable
probability (a 5 10%) of ruling out truly inactive agents
for further investigation.
The targeted accrual for the first stage was 19
patients but was allowed to deviate for administrative purposes. With 24 eligible and evaluable patients, more than
1 patient responding was required to go on to the second
stage. The cumulative targeted accrual for the second stage
was 34 patients but was allowed to deviate. With 36 eligible and evaluable patients, more than 3 patients with
responses were required to declare the agent sufficiently
active to warrant further evaluation.
The study was designed to limit the expected probabilities of type I and II errors to no greater than 10%
under the assumed accrual ranges of 15 to 22 patients
(first stage) and 30 to 37 patients (cumulatively after the
second stage). By using the method of Chen and Ng,9 if
346

the true RR was 5%, then the study design limited the average probability (across the accrual range) of incorrectly
designating the treatment as active to 10%. Conversely, if
the true RR was 20%, then the average probability of correctly classifying the treatment as active was 90%.
Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for PFS and OS,
and exact confidence intervals (CIs) were used for binary
parameters. The primary endpoint was the RR, which was
evaluated in a 2-stage design (with power of 0.90 for an
RR of 20% and a 5 .10 for an RR of 5%). The reverse
Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate median follow-up.10
Inhibin A and inhibin B values were measured every
cycle of treatment. We determined that a few inhibin A
and inhibin B values were less than the cutoff; in these
cases, the cutoff value was used for calculation. We also
determined that several inhibin B values were above the
cutoff; in these cases, the cutoff value was used for analysis. Results were similar when these values were excluded
from the analysis and when 0.5 times the lower cutoff and
1.5 times the upper cutoff were used. Analyses of time
point-specific values were done using medians and rankbased (nonparametric) methods. Medians of the 25th and
75th percentiles were used for summary statistics, and
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare groups.
Summary statistics and comparison of inhibin A and
inhibin B values between responders and nonresponders
are presented for only the first 4 cycles, because the number of patients with available data decreased from 32
patients with available data in cycle 1 to 22 patients with
available data in cycle 5. Joint models of both longitudinal
inhibin values and PFS also were used in random effects
models to model the inhibin values over time and in proportional hazards models. Natural log inhibin values were
used in these joint models.11

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

From September 2008 through January 2011, 36 patients
were enrolled, all of whom were eligible and evaluable.
Patient characteristics of the study group are listed in Table 1. The GOG performance status was zero in 30
patients (83.3%) and 1 in 6 patients (16.7%). Of the 36
patients, 32 patients had granulosa cell tumors (88.9%),
and 4 patients had an unclassified SCSTs (11.1%). When
the referring pathology diagnosis was compared with central pathology review, 33 of 36 patients (91.7%) had concordant results. All 3 patients for whom a different
diagnosis was rendered by central pathology review were

ultimately determined to have SCST, unclassified; these
patients had initial diagnoses of granulosa cell tumor,
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, and unknown, respectively.

chemotherapy, with a median of 2 prior regimens. Six

including 5 because of disease, 1 because of treatment and
disease, and 2 whose cause of death is pending.

Treatment Administration

In total, 491 cycles of bevacizumab were administered,
with a median of 9 treatment cycles per patient (range, 250 treatment cycles, with the maximum received by 1
patient who remained on the study).
Activity of Bevacizumab

The activity of bevacizumab was analyzed in the 36 enrolled patients. Six patients had a partial response (16.7%;
90% CI, 7.5%-30.3%), 28 patients had confirmed stable
disease (77.8%), and 2 patients had progressive disease
(5.6%). This RR met the criteria to declare the agent
active. For the 6 patients who had partial responses, the
median time to response was 8.2 months (25th to 75th
percentile, 1.5-14.4 months), and the duration of
response was 18.6 months (25th to 75th percentile, 17.927.2 months). The median PFS was 9.3 months, and the
median OS was not reached at a median follow-up of 32.5
months. Graphs of the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS
and OS for the study population are provided in Figures 1
and 2.
One patient remained on the study after 50 cycles
with a partial response as of December 2012. Five patients
remained alive without progression, 23 patients remained
alive with disease progression, and 8 patients died,

Toxicity

The safety of bevacizumab in all 36 patients was analyzed
descriptively, as indicated in Table 2, and the events listed
were reported as at least possibly related to study
drug. Grade 3 adverse events at least possibly related
to bevacizumab included hypertension (n 5 5), pain
(n 5 5), dyspnea, dyspnea 1 hypoxia, leukopenia,
anemia, hypophosphatemia, proteinuria, coagulation,
tinnitus, constipation and distension, fatigue, genitourinary=renal, hematoma, and syncope (n 5 1 each). Two
grade 4 toxicities were observed: hypertension and proteinuria. All cardiac events were related to hypertension, and
the gastrointestinal event was an incarcerated hernia that
required emergent surgery. There were no gastrointestinal
perforations. Four of 36 patients (11%) came off study
because of toxicity.
Inhibin A and Inhibin B

The median inhibin A value was 12 pg=mL at cycle 1
(baseline) and decreased slightly across the following 3
cycles to 12 pg=mL, 11 pg=mL, and 9 pg=mL. Inhibin A
values were lower (although the difference was not statistically significant; P 5 .100) at baseline in responders versus
nonresponders (median, 6 pg=mL vs 15 pg=mL); and the
values in cycles 2, 3, and 4 were statistically significantly
lower in patients who responded to treatment (median, 2
pg=mL) than in those who did not respond to treatment
(median, 30 pg=mL, 32 pg=mL, and 34 pg=mL in cycles
2, 3, and 4, respectively) (Table 3). The median inhibin B
value was 217 pg=mL at cycle 1 (baseline) and decreased

DISCUSSION
Bevacizumab administered as a single agent appears to be
active and to have acceptable toxicity in women with
recurrent SCSTs of the ovary. This represents a significant
advance for women who have this rare disease, in whom
effective treatment options are quite limited and disease is
often chemorefractory. Previously, the only options for
systemic therapy included combined bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin; paclitaxel plus carboplatin; and hormone therapy.4,5,12,13 The ability to use bevacizumab as
an effective means of controlling tumor progression is a
meaningful addition to the short list of therapeutics available for these patients.
Pretreatment inhibin A and inhibin B values were
lower in patients who responded to therapy than in those
who did not respond, although the differences were not
statistically significant (P 5 .100). These values were significantly lower postbaseline in patients who responded to
bevacizumab than in those who did not respond. These
data suggest that further investigation into the potential
prognostic and predictive relevance of inhibins is warranted. Patients with high inhibin levels may have a more
aggressive tumor type that will not respond to bevacizumab or other treatments, whereas patients with lower levels may be good candidates for certain treatments, as
observed in this study. However, the conclusions drawn
from these pilot data need to be carefully considered,
because this is a small study, and further investigation is

required before it is used as a guideline. It is also interesting that the trend of inhibin A and B levels followed the
pattern of disease response, although this did not reach
statistical significance. The hazard level associated with
progression or death was higher with increasing inhibin A
than with increasing inhibin B, but neither trend reached
significance; therefore, the results do not suggest that
inhibin A is a better marker than inhibin B. It is possible
that the high percentage of stable disease in this study precluded the changing levels of inhibin A and B from reaching significance. It has been suggested that inhibins A and
B may represent effective markers for after progression or
response of disease on therapy, like CA 125 in epithelial
ovarian cancer, but further evaluation of the accuracy of
this correlation is needed.14,15 The use of high inhibin levels to triage patients away from bevacizumab, however, is
a new concept that bears further investigation.
The histology of most of these patients was granulosa cell tumor, which reflects the relative frequency of
this histologic subtype. Although care must be taken in
generalizing the results from this report to all patients
with stromal ovarian tumors, it is likely that the results of
this trial do apply to other histologic subtypes of stromal
ovarian tumors based on historic findings of similar
responses among patients with various subtypes of stromal
tumors.3,4,6,12,13
In this study, the tumor RR was used as the primary
endpoint, rather than survival or PFS, for several reasons.
The RR represents a clinically meaningful decision criterion for determining whether the therapy was effective or
ineffective when deciding on continuation into the second
stage of the study and when deciding on the success of the
overall study. There are limited prior data in this patient
population, which precluded the use of PFS or OS to
349

Original Article

judge the activity of the agent in this disease setting.
Instead, the objective response was used, and a relatively
low threshold for tumor response (5%) enabled us to have
reasonable probability (a 5 10%) of ruling out truly inactive agents for further investigation. A prior GOG trial in
previously treated patients with stromal tumors evaluated
bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin.12 The observed RR
in that trial was 37.5% (9 of 24 patients). However, in
that study, patients were required to be chemotherapynaive, whereas the current study allowed patients to
receive any number of prior chemotherapy regimens. It is
important to note that no biologic agent has been prospectively studied in patients with SCSTs before this trial.
Therefore, the tumor RR was chosen as the primary endpoint, because it is a more clinically useful parameter for
gauging the activity of bevacizumab in this specific disease
setting.
Because the rationale for this study was to identify
an antivascular agent for future combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and not simply its utility as monotherapy, the criteria to declare this agent interesting based
on an objective RR were set lower than the criteria for
identifying an agent with monotherapy activity. Therefore, the null hypothesis was set at 5%; if bevacizumab
yielded an RR 5%, then it would not be of interest to
evaluate further in combination with other agents. Therefore, although the RR was less than the conventionally
accepted rate of 20% to declare an agent active, bevacizumab met the conditions of this trial to declare it as an
active agent.
A substantial percentage of our patients experienced
stable disease. To determine stable disease in this clinical
trial required imaging studies that documented stable disease followed by confirmed imaging after 2 additional
treatment courses. Because courses were 3 weeks apart,
this implies at least 12 weeks of stable disease. The possibility exists that the indolent nature of this disease may
lead to a suggestion that the drug was responsible for stable disease when, in fact, tumor biology was responsible
for the large percentage of patients who experienced stable
disease. In the absence of a randomized trial comparing
therapy with a placebo arm, however, this is impossible to
determine with certainty. However, the eventual progression or death from disease of 29 patients and the median
PFS of 9.3 months suggest that this disease grows and
does not simply remain dormant, leading to our opinion
that the substantial rate of stable disease in this trial truly
represents drug effect. Previous reports on “active” agents
for stromal ovarian tumors reported a PFS of 14 to
19.6 months in patients with recurrent, measurable
350

disease.4,12,13 The long median time to progression in
those patients with stable disease, as well as a PFS comparable to that described in the published literature for
“active” compounds in stromal ovarian tumors,4,12,13
leads to the conclusion that the response rate, PFS, and
time to progression do represent real drug effects rather
than indolent tumor behavior.
The toxicity profile described in this study is typical
for bevacizumab, and represents findings that would be
expected. Bevacizumab appears to be tolerable in patients
with recurrent SCSTs.
To conduct meaningful clinical trials in rare tumors
outside of a cooperative group setting is difficult. The
short accrual time required to complete this trial highlights the feasibility of efficiently completing clinical trials
in patients with rare tumors in a cooperative group setting. Furthermore, the finding of activity in this tumor,
which, historically, has been relatively chemoresistant,
underscores the importance of allocating resources to perform cooperative group trials in rare tumors, because this
substantially moves the field forward. An additional
strength of running trials in the cooperative group setting
is the ability to assemble historic data sets against which
future trial results can be judged; this trial is the first step
in doing so for SCSTs of the ovary.
The results from this clinical trial indicate that bevacizumab has activity in the treatment of recurrent
SCSTs of the ovary and that toxicity is acceptable in this
treatment setting. Inhibin A and inhibin B levels appear
to be associated with response to therapy. Further investigation is warranted, and combination therapy with a
cytotoxic, targeted, or hormone agent may be an upcoming investigation in this cooperative group setting. In
addition, a randomized phase 2 study comparing paclitaxel and carboplatin with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced, and
recurrent chemotherapy-naive stromal ovarian tumors is
currently underway within this cooperative group, further refining optimal therapy for patients with these rare
tumors.
