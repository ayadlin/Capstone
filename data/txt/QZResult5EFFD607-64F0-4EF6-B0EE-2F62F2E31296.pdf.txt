Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumour. The neoplasms are difﬁcult to resect entirely
because of their highly inﬁltration property and leading to the tumour edge is unclear. Gliadel wafer has been used as an
intracerebral drug delivery system to eliminate the residual tumour. However, because of its local low concentration and short
diffusion distance, patient survival improves non-signiﬁcantly. Axl is an essential regulator in cancer metastasis and patient survival.
In this study, we developed a controlled-release polyanhydride polymer loading a novel small molecule, n-butylidenephthalide (BP),
which is not only increasing local drug concentration and extending its diffusion distance but also reducing tumour invasion,
mediated by reducing Axl expression. First, we determined that BP inhibited the expression of Axl in a dose- and time-dependent
manner and reduced the migratory and invasive capabilities of GBM cells. In addition, BP downregulated matrix metalloproteinase
activity, which is involved in cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BP regulated Axl via the extracellular signalregulated kinases pathway. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to epithelial cells in the invasive migratory
mesenchymal cells that underlie cancer progression; we demonstrated that BP reduced the expression of EMT-related genes.
Furthermore, we used the overexpression of Axl in GBM cells to prove that Axl is a crucial target in the inhibition of GBM EMT,
migration and invasion. In an in vivo study, we demonstrated that BP inhibited tumour growth and suppressed Axl expression in a
dose-dependent manner according to a subcutaneous tumour model. Most importantly, in an intracranial tumour model with BP
wafer in situ treatment, we demonstrated that the BP wafer not only signiﬁcantly increased the survival rate but also decreased Axl
expression, and inhibited tumour invasion. These results contribute to the development of a BP wafer for a novel therapeutic
strategy for treating GBM invasion and increasing survival in clinical subjects.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and malignant gliomas are the
most common and aggressive brain tumours because of their
highly vascularised and invasive neoplasms.1,2 The diffusely
invasive properties of malignant gliomas make them nearly
impossible to totally resect; thus, surgery plus radiotherapy and
eventual chemotherapy are the standard treatment.3–6 The
therapies available for treating these neoplasms are limited, and
the prognosis is extremely poor. In recent years, new strategies
have included developing drugs considered to be effective
therapeutic approaches to GBM growth, invasiveness and
vascularisation. In clinical treatment, interstitial chemotherapy
with biodegradable Gliadel wafer, which is loading with carmustine (BCNU), has been performed. Robert S Langer is the developer
of Gliadel wafer and has point out that the limitation of Gliadel
wafer is the short penetration distance ( o2 mm) of BCNU from
the wafer; it may be the reason why it is difﬁcult to completely
eradicate a residual tumour, and tumour invasion is poorly

inhibited. Consequently, we are developing a novel small
molecule that can selectively target oncogenic pathways and
diffuse over long distances that constitute a new strategy for GBM
treatment. Kinases are the most common class of proteins
targeted by these new drugs.
Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been shown to be linked
with various high-grade cancers and related to poor diagnosis;7 in
addition, it has been suggested to be involved in several cellular
responses, including cell survival, cellular adhesion, proliferation,
autophagy, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and natural killer cell differentiation.8,9 Axl was originally
identiﬁed as a transforming gene in chronic myeloid
leukaemia.8,10 Moreover, Axl activation has been associated with
several signal transduction pathways, including Akt, mitogenactivated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB and signal transducer
and activator of transcription.11,12 Recently, several RTKs have
been actively pursued as targets for therapeutic intervention.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been
demonstrated in organ ﬁbrosis and in the initiation of metastasis
for cancer progression.13 The EMT programme is activated by
Twist and the Snail family transcription factors Snail (Snail/SNAI1)
and Slug (Slug/SNAI2). These EMT transcription factors adjust the
epithelial gene expression, determined by the suppression of
genes encoding epithelial junctional complexes (for example,
E-cadherin and β-catenin) and cytokeratin, and induce the
expression of mesenchymal vimentin and N-cadherin.14,15 In
2008, a study demonstrated that Axl RTK is frequently overexpressed in both glioma and vascular cells and predicts poor
prognosis in GBM patients.16 In addition, several scientists have
determined that Axl RTK has the essential role of an EMT-induced
regulator in tumour formation, cancer metastasis and patient
survival.17,18 Furthermore, in our previous microarray data, we
determined that Axl RTK was considerably downregulated after BP
treatment.19
In this study, we developed a controlled-release 1, 3-bis(pcarboxyphenoxy)propane-co-sebacic acid (CPP-SA) polymer loading a novel small molecule, n-butylidenephthalide (BP), not only
increasing local concentration and extending its diffusion distance
but also reducing tumour cell invasion mediated by reducing Axl
expression. In our previous study, we proved that BP has
antitumour effects on GBM brain tumours in vitro and
in vivo.20,21 In 2008, we discovered a possible chemotherapy
target in GBM.19 In addition, our team observed that BP inhibited
telomerase activity and promoted GBM cell senescence.22,23 High
expression of MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)
in cancer cells may lead to blunting the therapeutic effect of
temozolomide (TMZ). Recently, we demonstrated that BP has a
combination effect with TMZ and reduces MGMT expression to
overcome TMZ drug resistance.24 In addition, we developed a
local drug delivery polymer-BP wafer;25 we demonstrated that the
BP wafer released 90% of the available BP by the 30th day and
proved that the released BP from a 10% BP wafer inhibited the
growth of malignant glioma RG2 cells by 90%, compared with
control wafer (0% BP wafer). Our BP wafer signiﬁcantly reduced
the tumour size in a dose-dependent manner in a subcutaneous
(SC) tumour model (F344 rat and nude mice) and in FGF-SV40
spontaneous brain tumour transgenic mice. These ﬁndings
indicate that BP is a promising new anticancer compound with
the potential for clinical application.
In this study, we aimed to determine the target that is involved
in GBM migration and invasion. We demonstrated that the smallmolecule drug BP reduced Axl expression and observed that Axl
played a role in mediating glioma cell proliferation, cell migration
and invasion. In an in vivo experiment, we developed a local
delivery system: a BP wafer was administered in a high dose. The
system prolonged rat survival 2.44-fold compared with a Gliadel
wafer. BP targeting of Axl may represent a promising new method
for intervening in GBM progression and invasion.
RESULTS
BP regulates axl expression in human GBM cells
In our previous study, we demonstrated the antitumour effects of
BP on GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay revealed that
BP exerted an antiproliferative effect on GBM cells; the IC50
concentration of DBTRG-05MG was 100 ± 3 μg/ml. In addition, we
used oligodeoxynucleotide-based microarray screening to identify
BP-mediated changes in gene expression.
To conﬁrm the microarray results, we examined the expression
of Axl in BP-treated DBTRG-05MG through reverse transcriptase–
PCR and western blotting. In cells treated with BP at its 100 μg/ml,
the mRNA expression of Axl was suppressed in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1a). In addition, the protein expression of Axl was

BP can downregulate Axl protein expression in DBTRG brain tumour

downregulated in DBTRG-05MG in a dose-dependent manner
after BP treatment (Figure 1b). Axl was signiﬁcantly decreased
after BP treatment. Axl is involved in cell migration and invasion;
therefore, we evaluated the possibility of inhibiting cell migration
and invasion through BP treatment.
BP inhibits human GBM cell migration and invasion
As shown in Figure 1, BP downregulated Axl expression in human
GBM cells. Axl is known as a cancer cell migration and invasion
correlation gene; therefore, we used various methods to evaluate
the effect of BP on the invasion and migration of DBTRG-05MG in
human GBM cells. First, we used a wound-healing assay, which is a
simple, inexpensive and originally developed method, to determine whether BP inhibited cell migration in the GBM cell line
DBTRG-05MG. The cells were grown in a culture dish until
reaching a conﬂuent phase; subsequently, ‘wounds’ were induced
by scraping a line with a plastic tip. The healing of the wound
margins was analysed within 24 h after drug treatment. Photomicrographs depicted in Figure 2a show that the number of
migrating cells decreased after BP treatment in a dose-dependent
manner. The 50 μg/ml group exhibited signiﬁcantly delayed
wound closure. In addition, we used Transwell ﬁlters with or
without Matrigel coating to assess the cell migration and invasion
ability after BP exposure. The results showed that BP can not only
stop cell migration (Figure 2b) but also inhibit cell invasion
(Figure 2c).
Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a crucial role in
tumour invasion and metastasis processes, we used a zymography
assay to detect extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrolytic enzymes. We
determined that BP signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the expression levels
of MMP (Figures 3 and 4). This revealed that BP mediates cell
migration and invasion by inhibiting ECM hydrolytic enzyme
activity.
Axl is required for mediating the inhibition of human GBM cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT by BP
To examine the functional importance of Axl expression mediated
by BP in tumour cell growth, migration and invasion, we induced
Axl overexpression in cells by transfecting them with the plasmid
pcDNA3.0-Axl. After colony selection, we obtained pcDNA3.0-neo
and pcDNA3.0-Axl DBTRG cell lines (Figure 5a). Figure 5b shows
that the viability of cells with Axl overexpression recovered
completely after BP exposure compared with the viability of

wild-type cells. In addition, Figures 6a and b reveal that the cell
migration and invasion ability recovered when cells overexpressed
Axl. These results showed that BP exerts a strong effect on the
viability, invasion and migration of human GBM cells by mediating
Axl expression.
To further explore the role of Axl in the EMT process, we
assessed changes in the gene expression proﬁle and protein
expression proﬁle upon Axl overexpression induced using the
plasmid pCDNA3.0-Axl. In the wild-type pCDNA3.0-neo group, we
observed that EMT-related factors were downregulated by BP
(Figures 7a and c). When Axl was overexpressed in cells, the
expression of EMT-related markers reversed (Figures 7b and d).

The data demonstrated that BP reversed the EMT in GBM cells
mediated by Axl regulation.
MAPK/ extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signalling

Gas 6/Axl signaling promotes growth, survival, and proliferation is
activated by MAPK/ERK signaling pathway which also known as
the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.10 We performed western blotting
to examine the activation status of ERK and Akt during BP-induced
pathway signalling in DBTRG cells. Strong activation of ERK was
observed 1 h after BP exposure. To investigate the signalling

pathways critical for the BP induction of Axl expression, we used
the chemical inhibitor PD98059 of ERK pathways to examine the
requirement for activating each pathway in BP-mediated Axl
downregulation. The inhibition of ERK kinase by PD98059
effectively blocked the BP-mediated inhibition of Axl. These
results indicate that the ERK pathway is more likely to contribute
to BP-induced regulation of Axl.

BP can inhibit tumour growth and reduce Axl and MMP2
expression in a xenograft model
This animal study was conducted in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of China Medical University. The protocol was approved
by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of China
Medical University. All surgery was performed under sodium
pentobarbital anaesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimise pain.
To evaluate the antitumour activity of BP in vivo, human brain
cancer xenografts were established through SC injection of
~ 2 × 106 DBTRG-05MG cells into the ﬂank of nude mice. After
the tumour size reached 100–250 mm3, mice were randomised
into control and treatment groups (n = 6) and administered a daily
SC injection of BP at 0, 300 or 500 mg/kg for 5 successive days and
then a SC injection of BP once per 2 days for 1 month. As shown in
Figure 9a, treatment with BP at 300 and 500 mg/kg signiﬁcantly
inhibited tumour growth. The GBM tumour tissues treated with BP
exhibited downregulation of Axl and MMP2 expression after
treatment, as determined through immunohistochemical staining.
In this study of SC tumour implantation, the results indicated that
BP not only inhibits tumour growth (Figure 9a) but also suppresses
tumour invasion in parallel with a decrease of Axl and MMP2
expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 9b).

BP prolonged the survival of rats with intracerebral tumours and
reduced the tumour invasion size correlated with Axl expression
In 2011, we developed a local interstitial method for delivering
BP by using polymer wafers25 and designated the wafers as
BP wafers. Local delivery of drugs by using controlled-release
polymers can increase the concentration of chemotherapeutical
agents in the brain and improve retention time. Controlled-release
polymers bypass the blood–brain barrier (BBB), preventing
systemic toxicity. We used an orthotic model to evaluate whether
this BP wafer could prolong the survival of rats and inhibit
GBM cell invasion in brain tissue. After surgery, we observed the
activity of the rats and used Kaplan–Meier survival curves to
evaluate their vital signs. The relative survival rate of the rats is
shown in Figure 9c and Table 1; the group of 25% BP wafer
prolonged survival 3.7-fold compared with the control group
(P o 0.01); the group of 25% BP wafer prolonged survival 2.4-fold
compared with the Gliadel wafer group. The brain tissues treated
with BP wafers showed that invasive cells decreased in a dosedependent manner and that Axl expression was downregulated
(Figure 9d).
These data indicated that the small molecule targeting Axl, BP,
inhibits brain tumour migration and invasion in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In our previous studies, we investigated Axl downregulation and
demonstrated that BP has high potential to be used as an
anticancer drug in GBM brain tumours.19–25 In the current study,
we investigated whether BP mediation of Axl is involved in GBM
cell migration and invasion. First, Axl mRNA and protein regulation
after BP treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner were
evaluated in 2 DBTRG cell lines (Figure 1); in addition, we studied
the cell migration and invasion ability (Figure 2). The results
showed that BP mediation of Axl mRNA expression decreased 12 h
after BP treatment, with the expression being the lowest after
24 h. The Axl protein expression was consistent with downregulation after 24 h of BP dose-dependent treatment. In addition,
the results showed that migrating and invasive cells were
repressed in a dose-dependent manner after BP treatment for
24 h (Figure 2). As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the decreasing
migration and invasion capacity was parallel with the downregulation of Ax1-1 by BP. This result implicates that the inhibition
of tumour invasion by BP might be caused by Axl.
To conﬁrm that Axl downregulation causes the inhibition of
tumour invasion, we induced Axl overexpression by transfecting
cells with the pcDNA3.0-Axl plasmid and then assessed the role of
Axl in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We determined
that BP signiﬁcantly reduced the viability, invasion and migration
of human GBM cells by mediating Axl RTK expression (Figures 5
and 6; P o 0.05). This suggests that Axl has a key role in the
inhibition of GBM invasion and migration by BP. MMPs have a
crucial role in tumour invasion and metastasis, and are essential
components for degrading the ECM; therefore, we investigated
the change of MMP expression after BP treatment. We observed
signiﬁcant changes in the expression levels of several MMPs
induced by BP (Figures 3 and 4), providing additional evidence
that BP inhibits tumour invasion and migration.
Because the EMT provides tumour cells with enhanced
migratory and survival attributes that facilitate malignant progression, we demonstrated that BP inhibited the EMT by reducing
N-cadherin, Twist, Snail and Slug expression, indicating that BP
can reverse the EMT and, thus, inhibit tumour invasion.
Furthermore, to determine the role of BP in Axl and EMT
regulation, we determined that the reversal of the EMT by BP is
abrogated by the tumour cell overexpression of Axl, which is
accompanied by the restoration of N-cadherin, Twist and Slug
expression (Figure 7). The results suggest that BP affecting EMT
plasticity might be related to Axl regulation.
In 2010, Gjerdrum stated that Axl is an essential EMT-induced
regulator in breast cancer, and Axl expression is signiﬁcantly
associated with reduced patient survival.17 Because the author
sought to determine the activation of which EMT programme
transcription factor leads to Axl upregulation, they analysed
a nonmalignant breast epithelial cell line (MCF10a) transduced
with retroviral constructs that expressed Twist, Zeb2, Snail or Slug.
The results showed that EMT induction by these transcription
factors was accompanied by enhanced Axl expression. In 2014,
another study stated that Axl induces the EMT and regulates the
function of breast cancer stem cells.18 However, no study has
reported that small molecules affect the EMT via Axl. Our study is
the ﬁrst to report that small molecules affect the EMT status in
GBM via Axl. This ﬁnding can be used to develop new drugs for
repressing GBM invasion.
In this study, we used western blot analysis to determine the
signalling pathway involved in BP-mediated Axl gene expression.
As shown in Figure 8a, ERK was signiﬁcantly phosphorylated after
BP treatment. We then used the ERK-speciﬁc inhibitor PD98059 to
examine whether the meditation of Axl by BP involved ERK
signalling. As shown in Figure 8b, BP-mediated Axl expression was
decreased when cells were pretreated with the ERK inhibitor. This
demonstrated that BP regulates Axl through the mitogenOncogene (2016) 2156 – 2165

activated protein kinase/ERK pathway. In 2008, we determined
that Nur77 is another potential target of BP chemotherapy in
GBM.19 However, the upregulation of Nur77 occurs via a PKC
signalling pathway, mediating the antitumour activity of BP in
brain tumour cells. Therefore, we propose that BP regulation of
various target genes might occur via different pathways. For
example, taxol was found that combined inhibition of Notch and
HER2 signalling pathways can indeed decrease recurrence rates
for breast cancers that are characterized by HER2 overexpression.
On the other hand, regarding to the chemoresistance on taxol,
Toll-like receptor-4 is more relevant that could be mediated by
activation of the nuclear factor-κB pathway26,27 This supports our
proposal that the same drug with different target genes mediates
different pathways.
Finally, to conﬁrm whether the in vitro mechanisms are the
same as those in vivo, we used two tumour animal models for our
study. First, in the xenograft study, we demonstrated that BP not
only inhibited tumour growth (Figure 9a) but also suppressed Axl
and MMP2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 9b).
Furthermore, in the orthrotopic tumour implant study, we used a
biodegradable polymer (CPP-SA) carrying BP to treat implanted
tumours. We observed that this treatment not only signiﬁcantly
prolonged the suriveral of rats (Figure 9c, Gliadel wafer P o0.05,
15% BP wafer Po 0.01, 25% BP wafer P o0.01) but also that the
number of invasive cells decreased after BP treatment in a dosedependent manner (Figure 9d). Local delivery of drugs by using
controlled-release polymers could extend the drug release time
and enhance the local drug concentration. In the case of Gliadel
wafer, they tracked the BCNU diffusion distance by measuring the
radioactivity in a rabbit brain tissue section. BCNU diffused only
2 mm and rapidly accompanying a concentration decrease 72 h
after implantation, which may be the reason the residual tumour
cell was not eradicated and the patients’ survival cannot prolong
more. We used an orthotopic tumour implant model to
demonstrate that our BP wafer diffused over a distance of more
than 20 mm in dog brains, and the released BP concentration
(3.03 mM) showed a higher sustenance than did the IC50 (100 μM)
120 h after BP wafer implantation (data not shown). It showed that
our BP wafer could diffuse long distance and sustain in effective
dose. Moreover, Holland28 showed that brain tumour tissue cells
migrate through the normal parenchyma, accumulate immediately below the pial margin (subpial spread), surround neurons
and vessels (perineuronal and perivascular satellitosis), and
migrate through the white matter tracks (intrafacicular spread).
The ultimate result of this invasive behaviour is the spread of
individual tumour cells and diffusion over long distances and into
regions of the brain essential for the poor survival of the patient.28
On the basis of this reason, we developed a novel small-molecule
delivery system that could diffuse for a long distance and could
reduce GBM cell migration and invasion.
Vajkoczy et al. described the identiﬁcation, functional manipulation, in vitro and in vivo validation and preclinical therapeutic

inhibition of a target RTK mediating glioma growth and invasion.29
We plan to investigate whether the invasion capacity is related to
Axl expression and rat survival in an incranial tumour implant BP
wafer model. Our results regarding rat survival indicated that the
BP wafer reduced GBM cell invasion by dose dependently
suppressing Axl expression.
In summary, we demonstrated that a novel small molecule, BP,
inhibited tumour migration and invasion by downregulating Axl
and, thus, reduced EMT. In addition, a biodegradable interstitial
release polymer loading BP exhibited an extended diffusion
distance and a prolonged release time, signiﬁcantly prolonging
animal survival. This may contribute a potential therapeutic target
for clinical intervention.

Cell lines and cell culture
The human GBM cell line DBTRG-05MG (BCRC 60380) was obtained from
the Bioresources Collection and Research Center (BCRC, Hsin Chu, Taiwan).
The cells were maintained using the RPMI-1640 (Hyclone) medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Cell cytotoxicity assay
The cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay. Cells were seeded in
96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) containing 200 μl of a growth medium.
The BP doses were serially diluted in various concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75,
100 and 125 μg/ml). After 24 h, the drug-containing medium was removed,
and a fresh medium containing 500 μg/ml MTT was added. The
absorbance of the dissolved solutions was determined using a PowerWave
Microplate ELISA Reader (Bio-TeK Instruments, Winoski, VT, USA) at a
wavelength of 570 nm. The results were determined through three
independent experiments.

Western blot analysis
Approximately 1 × 106 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and then
incubated in various concentrations of BP. The cells were lysed on ice with
100 μl of PRO-PREP Protein Extraction Solution (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc.,
Kyunggi-do, Korea) and centrifuged at 13 000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 °C. The
protein concentrations in the supernatants were quantiﬁed using a BSA

DBTRG cells were plated in six-well plates and added to a 1.5- ml medium
containing various concentrations of BP. After 24 h of treatment, the cellconditioned medium was collected and analysed for MMP activity by using
gelatin zymography. Our focus was on MMP2, because this is the major
gelatinase that is expressed by glioma cell lines. The samples were mixed
with an equal volume of a 2 × sample buffer (0.005% Bromophenol Blue,
20% glycerol, 4% SDS and 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 6.8)) and subjected to
nonreducing electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing
gelatin (1 mg/ml). The gels were then washed with 2.5% Triton X-100
and incubated in a digestion buffer at 37 °C for 48 h. The gels were stained
with Coomassie blue and subsequently destained.

extension at 72 °C and a ﬁnal 5 min extension step at 72 °C, then ﬁnally keep
at 4 °C. The name and sequences of the primers, cycles and annealing
temperature for each pair are listed in Table 2. The PCR products were
separated on 1 or 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and
visualised using the Vilber Lourmat imaging system (Marne la Vallee,
France), and the level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was
used as the control.

In vitro transfection
The plasmid was provided by the Shuang-En Chuang, Associate
Investigator, National Health Research Institutes. To create an Axloverexpressing DBTRG-05MG cell line, DBTRG-05MG cells were transfected
with a 4-μg pcDNA3.0-Axl or pcDNA3.0-neo vector by using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were subjected to selection for stable
integrants through exposure for 3 weeks to 200–400 μg/ml G418
(Invitrogen) in a complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
The cells were then assessed for the overexpression of Axl by using
western blot analysis.

Wound-healing assays
DBTRG-05MG cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured until nearly
conﬂuent (~90%). The cells were then incubated in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 25 μg/ml mitimycin C pretreated for 30 min. A wound
was then created by manually scraping the cell monolayer with a 200- μl
pipette tip. The cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline to remove ﬂoating cells. Cell migration into the wound was observed
and recorded at two preselected time points (0 and 24 h) in eight
randomly selected microscopic ﬁelds for each condition and time point.
The distance travelled by the cells was determined by measuring the
wound width at various time points and then subtracting it from the
wound width at time zero. The values were expressed as the migration
percentage, with the gap width at 0 h set as 0%.

Polymer preparation
SA prepolymer preparation. SA was recrystallised two times in alcohol.
SA monomers (2.7 g) were reﬂuxed with 60 ml of excess acetic anhydride
for 30 min at 135–140 °C in a vacuum (10 − 4 torr). Excess unreacted acetic
anhydride was removed, and the SA prepolymer was dried through
evaporation in a vacuum at 60 °C and then dissolved in dried toluene. The
SA prepolymer was precipitated in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dry ethyl ether
and dry petroleum ether from dried toluene (10:1, v/v) overnight. Excess
ethyl ether and petroleum ether were removed, and the SA prepolymer
was dried in a vacuum.
CPP prepolymer preparation. CPP monomers (3 g) were reﬂuxed with
50 ml of excess acetic anhydride for 30 min at 150 °C in a vacuum (10 − 4
torr). After cooling, the solution was ﬁltered using ﬁlter paper. Excess
unreacted acetic anhydride was removed, and the CPP prepolymer was
recrystallised at 0 °C. The remaining unreacted acetic anhydride was
removed, and dry ether was added to wash the CPP prepolymer overnight.
The dry ether was removed and the CPP was dried in a vacuum. The CPP
prepolymer was washed with dimethylformamide. Dry ether (dimethylformamide/dry ether, 1:9) was then added and incubated overnight. The dry
ether and dimethylformamide were removed, and the CPP prepolymer
crystals were dried in a vacuum.
Poly (CPP-SA) copolymer preparation. A mixture of CPP and SA
prepolymers at a ratio of 20:80 was added to a glass bottle in a vacuum.
The CPP and SA prepolymers were heated at 180 °C in an oil bath for 1.5 h,
and the pressure was reduced to 10 − 4 torr. Throughout the polymerisation, the vacuum pressure was reduced every 15 min. After 1.5 h, poly(CPPSA) copolymers were washed with dichloromethane, and petroleum ether
was then added to precipitate the poly(CPP-SA) copolymers. Finally, the
poly(CPP-SA) copolymers were washed with anhydrous ether and dried in
a vacuum. The p(CPP:SA; 20:80) polymers containing BP (BP wafer) or
BCNU (BCNU wafer) were synthesised according to the method described
by Domb and Langer.30

In vitro migration assay and invasion assay
Cells (2 × 104) were planted on the top of polycarbonate Transwell ﬁlters
(with or without Matrigel (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA, USA) for Transwell
assay). The BD Matrigel matrix is composed of laminin, collagen IV,
nidogen/entactin and proteoglycan on polyethylene terephthalate membranes containing 8-μm pores. For Transwell migration assays, cells were
suspended in a medium without serum, and this medium was used in the
bottom chamber. For the invasion assay, cells were suspended in a
medium without serum and a medium supplemented with serum in the
bottom chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The
nonmigratory or noninvasive cells in the top chambers were removed
with cotton swabs. The cells that invaded or migrated through the
membrane were ﬁxed in 100% methanol for 10 min, were then stained
with haematoxylin and counted under a microscope. Each experiment was
repeated three times.
In addition, we used an Oris system to evaluate cell migration and
invasion. The cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well into the 96-well
plate of an Oris Cell Invasion Assay Kit (Pla-typus, Madison, WI, USA). The

Antitumour activity in vivo
Xenograft model. Xenograft mice were used as a model to study the
cytotoxicity of BP in vivo: the procedure for implanting cancer cells was
similar to that used in previous studies. Male congenital athymic BALB/c
nude (nu/nu) mice were purchased from the National Science Council
(Taipei, Taiwan), and all procedures were performed in compliance with
the standard operating procedures of the Laboratory Animal Center of
China Medical University Hospital (Taichung, Taiwan). All experiments were
conducted using 6- to 8-week-old mice weighing 18–22 g. The backs of the
mice were subcutaneously implanted with 2 × 106 DBTRG-05MG cells.
When the tumours reached 100–250 mm3 in volume, the mice were
divided randomly into control and test groups consisting of six mice per
group. The BP treatment group was administered a SC injection at 300 or
500 mg/kg daily for an initial 5 days. After 5 days, the treatment frequency
was changed to once per 2 days. All mice used for therapy response
evaluations were killed 1 month after treatment in a double-blinded
manner. The control group was treated only with a vehicle. The mice were

weighed once every 3 days until day 30 to monitor the effects;
simultaneously, the tumour volume was determined by measuring the
length (L) and width (W). The tumour volume at day n (TVn) was calculated
as TV (mm3) = (LW2)/2.
Orthotic model. Male F344 rats (230–260 g) were obtained from the
National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All procedures were
performed in compliance with the standard operating procedures of the
Laboratory Animal Center of China Medical University (Taichung, Taiwan). The
rat glioblastoma tumour line 9 L was obtained from the BCRC. For intracranial
implantation, 9 L glioblastoma fragments measuring ~ 2 × 2 × 1 mm3 were
excised at the time of implantation. Using a microsurgical technique, a midline
incision was made on the posterior aspect of the head and the periosteum
was swept laterally to expose the sagittal, coronal and lambdoidal sutures.
A 3-mm burr hole was made over the left parietal region with its centre 5–
6 mm behind the coronal suture and 3–4 mm lateral to the sagittal suture. A
cruciate incision was made on the dura. On the 7th day after tumour
implantation, the rats were randomly divided into ﬁve groups (n ⩾ 6) for
initiation of treatment and subjected to another operation for the insertion of
polymeric discs with double blind. The BP wafers were prepared using the
procedures described by Domb and Langer.30 The animals were killed when
they exhibited an ataxic gait, or, in the advanced stages, when they displayed
extensor posturing of the hind legs.

Immunohistochemical staining
The tumour tissues were ﬁxed in 10% formalin overnight and then
embedded in parafﬁn. Parafﬁn sections (5 μm) were deparafﬁnised in
xylene and rehydrated through a graded series of (75–100%) ethanol
solutions. The sections were incubated for 10 min in hydrogen peroxide
and protein blocks at room temperature, followed by 1 h of incubation
with a dilution primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, we used a detection system (UltraVision Quanto Detection
System, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) to detect the signal. Finally,
sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, mounted, observed
under a light microscope at a magniﬁcation of × 200 and photographed.

Statistical analysis
The experiment groups and size were decided after discussion with
statistic expert in our institute. And all experiments were performed in
three or more independent assays, which yielded highly comparable
results. Data are summarised as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
analysis of the results was performed using a Student's t-test for unpaired
samples. The P valueo0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
