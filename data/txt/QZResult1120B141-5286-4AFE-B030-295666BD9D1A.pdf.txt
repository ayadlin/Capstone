Abstract
RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor implicated in many tumorigenic
processes; however, the basis for its tumor suppressor functions are
not fully understood. Here we show that RASSF1A is a novel
antagonist of protumorigenic RhoA activity. Direct interaction
between the C-terminal amino acids (256–277) of RASSF1A and
active GTP-RhoA was critical for this antagonism. In addition,
interaction between the N-terminal amino acids (69-82) of
RASSF1A and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) disrupted GTPase activity by facilitating
Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination of GTP-RhoA. We noted that the
RhoA-binding domain of RASSF1A displayed high sequence
homology with Rho-binding motifs in other RhoA effectors, such

as Rhotekin. As predicted on this basis, RASSF1A competed with
Rhotekin to bind RhoA and to block its activation. RASSF1A
mutants unable to bind RhoA or Smurf1 failed to suppress
RhoA-induced tumor cell proliferation, drug resistance, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, and metastasis.
Clinically, expression levels of RASSF1A and RhoA were inversely
correlated in many types of primary and metastatic tumors and
tumor cell lines. Collectively, our ﬁndings showed how RASSF1A
may suppress tumorigenesis by intrinsically inhibiting the tumorpromoting activity of RhoA, thereby illuminating the potential
mechanistic consequences of RASSF1A inactivation in many cancers. Cancer Res; 76(7); 1847–59. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

RASSF1A is one of the most heavily methylated genes in
human cancers and restoration of its expression decreases in
vitro colony formation, suppresses anchorage-independent
growth, and reduces in vivo tumorigenicity (6, 7). RASSF1A
interacts with proapoptotic MST1 and MST2, known to activate
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and also enhances death
receptor–evoked apoptosis by binding to modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP1), a Bax-binding protein and stimulating a
complex formation with TNFa receptor-1 (4, 8–10). RASSF1A
inhibits cyclin D1 accumulation and regulates G1–S cell-cycle
progression in a p53-dependent manner by promoting MDM2
self-ubiquitination through disruption of the MDM2–DAXX–
HAUSP complex (11, 12). RASSF1A also induces prometaphase
arrest through interaction with Cdc20, an activator of the
anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and consequent blockade
of the APC–Cdc20 interaction (13). RASSF1A also binds to and
stabilizes microtubules and controls the tubulin dynamics,
which is intimately related with its capacity to promote cellcycle arrest and suppress cell motility (14–16).
Although RASSF family members contain a RA domain that
potentially associates with the Ras family of GTPase, the ability
of most RASSF proteins to associate with Ras has yet to be
clearly established. To date, only RASSF2, RASSF4, and RASSF5
have been observed to associate directly with K-Ras (17–19).
Contradictory reports of Ras association with RASSF1A lead to
the conjecture that Ras association with RASSF1A might be
indirect and most likely mediated through heterodimerization
with RASSF5A (20). Moreover, it is still subject to debate that
active Ras is required for RASSF1A to function as a tumor
suppressor and RASSF1A modulates truly the growth inhibitory

The Ras-association domain family (RASSF) of proteins
comprises 10 members encoded by different genes
(RASSF1–RASSF10), which share the presence of the RA
domain (1). The RASSF1 gene located at 3p21.3 is the best
characterized RASSF member that is epigenetically silenced in a wide variety of adult and childhood cancers (2–4).
The RASSF1 gene generates seven tissue-speciﬁc transcripts
(RASSF1A-G) and two major variants, RASSF1A and C, are
ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues and have four common exons (exons 3–6), which encode a RA domain (1).
RASSF1A encodes a 39 kDa peptide containing several
domains that are important for its role as a tumor suppressor,
including the C1 zinc ﬁnger domain for death receptor association, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated phosphorylation site
for DNA damage repair and the SAV/RASSF/HIPPO (SARAH)
domain for association with mammalian sterile 20-like
kinases, MST1 and MST2 (4, 5).

response mediated by Ras and that RASSF1A utilizes an as
yet unidentiﬁed GTPase to provoke its tumor suppression
effects (4, 10).
To understand the molecular basis of RASSF1A-mediated
tumor suppression, we explored the possible involvement of
RASSF1A in the regulation of Rho family of small GTPase. Here
we present evidence that RASSF1A is a novel antagonist of RhoA
tumor-promoting activity, which binds directly to active GTPRhoA and facilitates its proteosomal degradation via interaction
with Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) ubiquitin
E3 ligase. Thus, our study demonstrates a new mechanism by
which RASSF1A controls multiple processes in RhoA-driven
tumor progression.

Materials and Methods
Human cell lines and tissue specimens
Human cancer cell lines (DU145, HCT116, HeLa, A549, and
MDA-MB-231) were purchased from ATCC. IMR-90 cells
(human fetal lung ﬁbroblast) were obtained from Korea Cell
Line Bank. All these cell lines were authenticated by short
tandem repeat proﬁling at Korea Cell Line Bank before use.
Allelic score data revealed a pattern related to the scores
reported by the ATCC, and consistent with their presumptive
identity. A549 (Tet-RASSF1A) cells were generated by cotransfection of RASSF1A (pcDNA4/TO) and tetracycline repressor
vector (pcDNA6/TR; Invitrogen) and selected under blasticidin
(5 mg/mL) and zeocin (100 mg/mL). A total of 60 primary
tumor specimens and their adjacent normal tissues were
obtained by surgical resection in the Kyung Hee University
Medical Center (Sungbuk-gu, Seoul, Korea).
Expression plasmids and siRNA
Expression vectors for wild-type (WT) and deletion mutants
of RASSF1A, RhoA, and Smurf1 were constructed using a PCRbased approach. Single amino acid substitution mutants of
RASSF1A and dominant negative (DN) and constitutively active
forms of RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras were
generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene). siRNA duplexes against RASSF1A, RhoA, Smurf1, and
S100A4 and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs against
RASSF1A and Smurf1 were synthesized by Dharmacon Research
or purchased from Invitrogen.
Small GTPase pull-down assay
GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 levels were measured using
Upstate active Rho assay kit (Millipore Corporation). Brieﬂy, cell
lysates were incubated with Rhotekin RGD-agarose (for GTPRhoA) and PAK1 RBD-agarose (for GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42)
beads for 45 minutes at 4 C. The protein/beads complexes were
washed with Upstate lysis buffer and the bound proteins were
eluted in freshly prepared 2X SDS sample buffer.
Immunoprecipitation and IHC
Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were carried out as described
previously (21). Antibodies speciﬁc for RASSF1A (eB114), Smurf1
(sc-25510), phospho-MLCl (Ser19, #3671), RhoA (sc-418), Rac1
(sc-95), CDC42 (sc-6083), RhoGAP (sc-30206), RhoGEF
(sc-20804), b-tubulin (T0198), and Actin (sc-1616) were purchased from eBioscience, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cell Signaling Technology, and Sigma-Aldrich. Immunohistochemical assay

was performed using tissue arrays (SuperBioChips Laboratory)
and Vectastain ABC (avidin-biotin-peroxidase) kit (Vector Laboratories) as described previously (22).
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis
To determine RASSF1A effect on RhoA activation, a ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was performed using Raichu-Rhotekin-RBD as a biosensor of active
RhoA (23). The cells were cotransfected with pRaichu-Rhotekin-RBD and either control-RFP or RASSF1A-RFP and treated with EGF (50 ng/mL) for 3 hours. The FRET measurements were performed on a Zeiss LSM 700 using emission
ﬁlters for CFP (433 nm excitation, 450/88 nm emission), YFP
(433 nm excitation, 585/42 nm emission), and FRET channel
(433 nm excitation, 530/30 nm emission). Quantiﬁcation of
the average FRET/CFP ratio obtained from image data was
analyzed using MetaMorph software (Version 7.5, Molecular
Devices).
In vitro translation, binding, and GST pull-down assays
In vitro transcription and translation were carried out using
TNT Quick Coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and
biotinylated tRNA molecule (Transcend tRNA, Promega). For
preparation of nucleotide-free RhoA-G14V and RhoA-T19N,
Flag-RhoA proteins were incubated in nucleotide binding buffer
and coupled to Flag agarose beads. The complexes were puriﬁed
with 0.1 mol/L glycine buffer. To generate GTPgS or GDP bound
form, nucleotide-free Flag-RhoA proteins were incubated in
nucleotide binding buffer containing GTPgS or GDP and 10
mmol/L MgCl2. Puriﬁed RASSF1A-V5 was incubated with either
GTPgS-loaded Flag-RhoA-G14V or GDP-loaded Flag-RhoAT19N and immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 or anti-Flag antibody. For GST pull-down assay, 1 mg of GTPgS-loaded GSTRhoA (G14V) was immobilized on GSH beads and incubated
with 1 mg of puriﬁed Rhotekin-V5 and increasing amounts of
RASSF1A-V5.
Tumor invasion assay
Cells were plated onto Biocoat Matrigel invasion membranes
(BD Biosciences). After 25-hour incubation, the remaining tumor
cells on the top surface of the ﬁlters were removed by wiping with
cotton swabs, and the invading cells on the bottom surface were
stained with May–Gr€
unwald–Giemsa staining. The number of
cells on the bottom surface was counted under a microscope at a
magniﬁcation of 200.
Animal studies
Mouse tumor xenograft assay was carried out as described
previously (21). For tumor cell colonization assay, A549 cells
were injected intravenously and numbers of nodules in the lungs
were counted after 20 days of injection. All animal studies were
performed with the approval of Korea University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and Korea Animal Protection
Law.
Statistical analysis
Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion assays
were performed in triplicate and data were presented as a mean 
SD. Student t test was used to determine the statistical signiﬁcance.
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (r) was used to measure the

strength of the association between RASSF1A and RhoA expression levels in human tissues. A P value of less than 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant.

Results
RASSF1A suppresses RhoA activation by destabilizing GTPRhoA
To delineate the RASSF1A regulation of Rho family GTPases, we
initially examined its effect on Rho GTPase-induced actin reorganization using DU145 prostate cancer cells. In pcDNA control
subline cells, transfection of constitutively active RhoA (G14V),
Rac1 (T115I), and Cdc42 (G12V) led to the formation of stress
ﬁber, lamellipodia, and ﬁlopodia, respectively (Fig. 1A). However, RhoA-induced stress ﬁber and membrane rufﬂing were substantially attenuated in DU145-RASSF1A subline cells whereas
Rac1-induced lamellipodia and Cdc42-induced ﬁlopodia were
not affected. RASSF1A inhibition of RhoA-induced membrane
protrusion was also observed in J82 (bladder), A549 (lung), and
HCT116 (colon) cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, a
FRET assay using Raichu-Rhotekin-RBD as a biosensor for active
RhoA revealed that EGF-mediated RhoA activation is blocked by
RASSF1A (Fig. 1B). Consistently, RASSF1A inhibited RhoA activation of FAK, MLC, LIMK1/2, and Myc (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Ras-induced Raf–Mek–Erk1/2 signaling was not affected by
RASSF1A (Supplementary Fig. S1C). RASSF1A transfection
resulted in a dose-associated decrease in RhoA protein level but
did not affect two closely related isoforms, RhoB and RhoC (Fig.
1C and D). Unlikely RASSF1A, RASSF1C, an isoform with a single
N-terminal exon (exon 2g), showed no RhoA-reducing activity.
RhoA cycles between an active GTP-RhoA state and an inactive
GDP-RhoA state, and GTP-RhoA level is upregulated and downregulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and
GTPase–activating proteins (GAP), respectively (24). Using small
GTPase pull-down assay, we found that GTP-RhoA level is profoundly decreased by RASSF1A (Fig. 1E). Moreover, GTP-RhoA
induction by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, or EGF was strongly
upregulated and downregulated by RASSF1A depletion and overexpression, respectively (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1D
and S1E). RASSF1A exerted no detectable effect on Rho-GAP and
Rho-GEF level, suggesting that RASSF1A may target directly
GTP-RhoA (Supplementary Fig. S1F). To address this, we compared RASSF1A effect on RhoA-G14V (GTP-binding) and RhoAT19N (GDP-binding) and found that RhoA-G14V but not RhoAT19N level was downregulated by RASSF1A (Fig. 1G). It was
also shown that the half-life of RhoA protein is reduced from
approximately 8.1 hour to 3.9 hour by RASSF1A overexpression
and this effect of RASSF1A is blocked by proteosomal inhibitors
MG132, LLnL, or Lactacystin (Fig. 1H and I and Supplementary
Fig. S1G).
RASSF1A binds to GTP-RhoA via the C-terminal 256-277
residues within the RA domain
Next we examined whether RASSF1A interacts with RhoA. IP
assay of endogenous and transfected proteins revealed that
RASSF1A interacts with RhoA-G14V but not with RhoA-T19N
and active Ras proteins (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Moreover, in vitro translation-binding assay showed
that RASSF1A binds directly to RhoA-G14V (Fig. 2C). Using a
series of deletion mutants, we detected that the C-terminal
amino acids 256-277 of RASSF1A and the N-terminal amino

www.aacrjournals.org

acids 1-97 of RhoA are essential for the interaction (Fig. 2D
and E and Supplementary Fig. S2B). RASSF1A mutants lacking
this region showed no inhibitory effect on RhoA expression. As
predicted, RASSF1A-D256-277 failed to block RhoA-induced
MLC and IkB phosphorylation (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, the
DN4 (lacking amino acids 1-119) but not DN2 (lacking
amino acids 1-68) mutant also failed to downregulate RhoA,
suggesting that the N-terminal 69-119 residues might be
involved in RhoA degradation (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, all of
the single amino acid substitution mutants (L266G, R267F,
L268G, R269F, L270G, and G272L) we tested failed to bind
and downregulate RhoA. Likewise, RASSF1A-R269F showed
no inhibitory effect on EGF activation of RhoA signaling (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Interestingly, RASSF1C, which shares
amino acids 129-340 with RASSF1A but has unique exon 2gencoding N-terminal 49 amino acids, did not interact with
RhoA, but a exon 2g-deleted RASSF1C mutant showed RhoAbinding ability, suggesting that the exon 2g may block the
RhoA-binding activity provoked by the 256-277 residues
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E).
RASSF1A stimulates Smurf1-mediated RhoA ubiquitination via
direct binding to Smurf1
We asked whether Smurf1, a previously reported RhoA-targeting ubiquitin E3 ligase, is involved in RASSF1A-mediated RhoA
degradation (25). A CHX chase assay showed that RASSF1Ainduced RhoA degradation is impaired by Smurf1 depletion
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, RASSF1A expression strongly promoted RhoA ubiquitination and this effect was blocked by
Smurf1 depletion (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3C). The offtarget effect of siSmurf1 was excluded by a rescue assay using
siSmurf1-3UTR designed to target the 30 -untranslated region and
nontargetable Smurf1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
RhoA ubiquitination by RASSF1A was upregulated and downregulated by WT- and DN-Smurf1, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). In vitro binding and sequential IP assays revealed that
RASSF1A binds directly to Smurf1 and form a protein complex
with RhoA and Smurf1 (Fig. 3B and C). It was also shown that the
N-terminal amino acids 69-82 of RASSF1A and the HECT domain
of Smurf1 are responsible for the interaction (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3E). RASSF1A mutants lacking the Smurf1binding region showed no activity to reduce GTP-RhoA level,
and the Smurf1–RhoA interaction was enhanced by WT-RASSF1A
but not by RASSF1A-R269F (Fig. 3E and F). These data indicate
that RASSF1A binds to Smurf1 and promotes Smurf1-mediated
RhoA ubiquitination by facilitating Smurf1–RhoA interaction
(Supplementary Fig. S3F).
RASSF1A suppresses Rhotekin interaction with and activation
of RhoA
Multiple effector molecules interact with RhoA through a
conserved leucine zipper-like motif (26). Interestingly, we noted that the RhoA-binding region (amino acids 256-277) of
RASSF1A has a high degree of similarity to the Rho-binding
motifs of other Rho effectors, including Rhotekin, PKN, PRK2,
and Rhophilin, raising the possibility that RASSF1A may compete with these effectors in binding RhoA (Fig. 4A). As predicted, RhoA–Rhotekin and RhoA–RASSF1A interactions were
strongly impeded by RASSF1A and Rhotekin, respectively
(Fig. 4B and C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore, a

Lee et al.

GST pull-down assay using puriﬁed GST-RhoA (G14V), Rhotekin-V5, and RASSF1A-V5 proteins revealed that RASSF1A–RhoA
interaction interferes with Rhotekin–RhoA interaction, supporting that RASSF1A competes with Rhotekin in binding
RhoA (Fig. 4D). Consistently, RASSF1A and Rhotekin regulation of RhoA ubiquitination was blocked by cotransfection of
Rhotekin and RASSF1A, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4B
and S4C). In contrast, RASSF1A-R269F exerted no effect on
the Rhotekin–RhoA interaction and RhoA ubiquitination
(Supplementary Fig. S4D). Recent studies showed that Rhotekin interacts with S100A4, a myosin IIA heavy chain–binding
protein, thereby permitting S100A4 to complex with RhoA and
switch RhoA function from stress ﬁber formation to membrane rufﬂing to confer an invasive phenotype (27). On the
basis of this, we further tested whether RASSF1A antagonizes
RhoA function by blocking RhoA–Rhotekin interaction.
RASSF1A did not affect S100A4 protein level, but its overexpression and depletion profoundly downregulated and
upregulated S100A4 interaction with RhoA, whereas
RASSF1A-R269F exerted no effect on S100A4–RhoA interaction (Fig. 4E and F and Supplementary Figs. S4E and S4F).
S100A4 stimulation of RhoA-mediated P-MLC, MMP-9, and Pp65 induction was abrogated by WT-RASSF1A but not by
RASSF1A-R269F (Supplementary Fig. S4G). Likewise, RhoAinduced, S100A4-mediated lamellipodia and membrane rufﬂing was attenuated by WT-RASSF1A or RASSF1A-D69-82 but
not by RASSF1A-R269F (Fig. 4G). These data indicate that
RASSF1A antagonizes RhoA function by impeding effector
interaction with and activation of RhoA.
RASSF1A-mediated tumor suppression is linked to its
RhoA-antagonizing activity
Next we asked whether the RhoA-antagonizing activity of
RASSF1A is linked to its tumor suppression function. RhoA
or EGF activation of cyclins (E and D1) and suppression of
CDK inhibitors (p21WAF1 and p27KIP1) were blocked by
WT-RASSF1A but not by RASSF1A-R269F, and this effect of
RASSF1A was not detected in RhoA-depleted cells (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S5A). RhoA repression of p21WAF1 mRNA
was also impeded by WT-RASSF1A but not by D256-277 or
D69-82 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Cell growth and
DNA synthesis were inhibited by WT-RASSF1A but not by
D256-277 or D69-82 mutant, and RhoA-induced tumor cell
resistance to 5-FU- or etoposide-induced apoptosis was abolished by WT-RASSF1A but not by R269F or D256-277 mutant
(Fig. 5B–D and Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D). Wound
healing and Matrigel assays revealed that RhoA-driven tumor
cell migration and invasion are suppressed by WT-RASSF1A
but not by R269F or L266G mutant, and that increased
cell migration triggered by RASSF1A depletion is attenuated
by codepletion of RhoA (Fig. 5E and F and Supplementary
Fig. S5E and S5F). Likewise, RhoA-induced MMP-9 expression was blocked by WT-RASSF1A but not by R269F mutant (Fig. 5G). Moreover, in DU145 cells, TGFb1-induced,
RhoA-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
was blocked by WT-RASSF1A but not by R269F mutant
whereas it is further promoted by depletion of RASSF1A or
Smurf1 (Fig. 5H and Supplementary Figs. S5G–S5I). Consistently, TGFb1 repression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin,
ZO-1, and cytokeratin 18) and induction of mesenchymal
markers (ﬁbronectin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin) were down-

1854 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

regulated and upregulated by RASSF1A expression and depletion, respectively (Fig. 5I).
RASSF1A suppresses RhoA-driven tumor growth and
colonization
To delineate the RASSF1A regulation of RhoA in vivo, we
carried out mouse tumor xenograft assays using shRNA-mediated knockdown of RASSF1A or Smurf1. Compared with shControl tumors, shRASSF1A tumors exhibited substantially higher
growth rate and elevated total and GTP-bound RhoA protein
levels (Fig. 6A and B). Moreover, RhoA-driven tumor growth
was signiﬁcantly suppressed by WT-RASSF1A but not by D256277 and D69-82 mutants (Fig. 6C and D). Likewise, RASSF1Amediated growth suppression and RhoA downregulation were
markedly debilitated in Smurf1-depleted tumors (Fig. 6E and F).
Tumor cell colonization assay using tail vein injection of A549
cells showed that RhoA-driven tumor cell colonization in the
lungs is blocked by WT-RASSF1A but not by D256-277 and D6982 mutants in a highly Smurf1-dependent manner (Fig. 6G–I
and Supplementary Fig. S6A).
GTP-RhoA level is inversely correlated with RASSF1A
expression in human cancers
To ascertain the relationship between RASSF1A and RhoA in
human tumor tissues, we characterized their expression status in
47 cancer cell lines and 60 primary tumor specimens derived
from the colon, stomach, and bladder. Compared with normal
tissues, a substantial fraction of primary tumors displayed
higher GTP-RhoA and lower RASSF1A expression, and an inverse
correlation of RASSF1A and GTP-RhoA levels was identiﬁed in
both cancer cell lines and primary tumors (Fig. 7A and B).
Immunohistochemical study also revealed a strong inverse correlation between RASSF1A and RhoA in lung, breast, and colorectal tissues (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Fig. S7A). Although all
of 27 normal tissues we tested exhibited high ( level 2.5)
RASSF1A and low (< level 2.5) RhoA levels, high RhoA immunoreactivity was detected in 82 of 117 (70.1%) low RASSF1A
tumors but only in 7 of 33 (21.2%) high RASSF1A tumors
(Fig. 7D). Furthermore, 26 of 30 (86.7%) metastatic tumors
displayed higher RhoA and lower RASSF1A levels compared
with their matched primary tumors. Collectively, our study
identiﬁes that RASSF1A is a novel antagonist of RhoA, whose
loss of expression contributes to RhoA-driven tumor progression (Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Loss of expression of RASSF1A is implicated in many aspects
of tumorigenesis, including tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. However, important questions that remain unanswered are
that RASSF1A associates with the Ras family of GTPase and
RASSF1A utilizes an as yet unidentiﬁed GTPase to provoke its
tumor suppression effects. In the current study, we demonstrated
ﬁrst that RASSF1A binds directly to RhoA GTPase, promotes
Smurf1-mediated RhoA ubiquitination, and blocks RhoA-driven
tumorigenic processes. Our study thus establishes that RASSF1A
represents one critical RhoA-interacting protein that antagonizes RhoA's tumor-promoting activity, adding a new mechanism by which RASSF1A functions as a tumor suppressor.
The presence of the RA domain initially led to the conjecture
that the RASSF family proteins could associate with Ras GTPases

and play a role as effector molecules in the Ras signaling pathways (1). Studies showed that several RASSF family members,
including RASSF2, 4, 5, and 6, interact with the active forms
of H- or K-Ras (28, 29). Although RASSF1A was reported to form
a complex with activated K-Ras, mediate oncogenic K-Ras–
dependent apoptosis, and block Ras-induced genomic instability, it is still controversial that RASSF1A associates directly
with Ras and the RA domain is required for its Ras effector
function (15, 30). A structural study indicated that RASSF1A
does not bind to classical Ras GTPases and the Ras-RASSF1A
association is much weaker than the Ras-RASSF5A association,
raising the possibility that Ras association with RASSF1A may
be weak and/or mediated indirectly through heterodimerization with RASSF5A (20,31). On the basis of these observations,
it was proposed that the RA domain of RASSF1A may associate
with a yet unknown small GTPases. In the current study, we
found that RASSF1A binds to RhoA GTPase through the amino
acid 256-277 region within the RA domain. Moreover, RASSF1A
was identiﬁed to bind speciﬁcally to a GTP-bound active
RhoA but not interact with other Rho isoforms RhoB and RhoC
and other Rho GTPase members Rac1 and Cdc42. RASSF1A was
also shown to bind to Smurf1 ubquitin E3 ligase, promotes
Smurf1 interaction with RhoA, and thus stimulates Smurf1mediated RhoA ubiquitination. An important role for RASSF1A
in the formation of the Smurf1–RhoA complex in RhoA degradation was supported by the observation that mutant
RASSF1A lacking either Smurf1- or RhoA-binding motif fails
to destabilize RhoA. Furthermore, our study showed that high
GTP-RhoA level is closely associated with low RASSF1A level
in multiple human cancer cells and tumor tissues, supporting
that RhoA-driven tumor progression is attributed partially to
RASSF1A inactivation.
RASSF1C shares amino acids 129-340 with RASSF1A. However, we observed that RASSF1C does not bind to RhoA despite
the presence of the RA domain. RASSF1C has no SH3 binding
and C1 domains encoded by exons 1a and 2ab in RASSF1A, but
instead carries a unique N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-49)
encoded by alternative exon 2g (1). A NMR study revealed that
RASSF5 has an intramolecular association between the C1
domain and the RA domain, leading to the conjecture that the
C1 domain-dependent conformation of RASSF1A, which has
60% amino acid identity to RASSF5, may play a role in its RA
domain-mediated interaction with RhoA (32). However, our
study showed that a mutant RASSF1A lacking the C1 domain
normally binds to RhoA, excluding the role of the C1 domain in
the interaction with RhoA. It is thus conceivable that the unique
exon 2g-encoding N-terminal region of RASSF1C may have an
inhibitory role for the RA domain association with RhoA.
Indeed, we found that a RASSF1C mutant lacking exon 2g
interacts with RhoA. Although further studies are required, our
data supports that the N-terminal variability of RASSF1 proteins
may play a key role in determining isoform-speciﬁc functions,
including the speciﬁcity of interacting proteins.
RhoA signaling is controlled by multiple effector molecules
that interact directly with RhoA through a conserved leucine
zipper-like motif (26, 33). In this study, we identiﬁed that the
RhoA-binding region (amino acids 256-277) of RASSF1A has a
high degree of amino acid similarity to the RhoA-binding motif
of several Rho effectors, including Rhotekin, RTKN, Rhophilin,
and PKN. Moreover, RASSF1A interacts with RhoA N-terminal
region (amino acids 1-97), which comprises the switch region I

1858 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

and II that are also known to bind directly to Rhotekin and
Rhophilin (26, 34). This suggests that in addition to promoting
Smurf1-mediated RhoA ubiquitination, RASSF1A could suppress RhoA signaling by hindering effector binding and activation of RhoA. Indeed, our results showed that RASSF1A
blocks RhoA signaling by disrupting Rhotekin interaction with
RhoA. Therefore, RASSF1A suppresses RhoA through Smurf1dependent and Smurf1-independent mechanisms.
RhoA plays essential roles in the regulation of various cellular processes, in particular, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cellextracellular matrix adhesion, and cell migration, which are connected directly to invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (35).
RASSF1A binds to tubulins and controls the microtubule dynamics and loss of this property is associated with reduced ability to
promote cell-cycle arrest and suppress cell motility (15, 36).
Although accumulating evidences support that RASSF1A association with microtubules is intimately related with its tumor suppression function, the molecular basis for this activity remains
largely undeﬁned (14, 16). In the current study, we observed that
RASSF1A is colocalized with RhoA and Smurf1 at the protruding
edge of cells and blocks RhoA-induced actin rearrangement and
lamellipodia and protrusion formation. It was also shown that
RASSF1A suppresses RhoA-induced tumor cell migration, invasion, and in vivo growth and colonization and this effect is highly
relied on its property to bind RhoA and Smurf1. Considering that
Smurf1 regulates cell polarity and protrusion formation by targeting local RhoA for degradation, our data support that RASSF1A
controls directly RhoA-mediated membrane movements and its
microtubule stabilizing is provoked, at least in part, via a complex
formation with RhoA and Smurf1. It is also noticeable that a
RASSF1A mutant lacking the RhoA-binding motif loses the microtubule localization and is redistributed within the nucleus, supporting that RASSF1A microtubule localization is linked to its
tumor suppression function. RhoA activation is critical for oncogenic EMT, particularly during early steps of TGFb1-induced EMT
(37). In agreement with these, we found that RASSF1A suppresses
TGFb1-induced EMT via its RhoA-antagonizing activity. Although
the physiologic consequence of the RASSF1A–RhoA–Smurf1 interaction is only beginning to be determined, the evidence we
obtained here demonstrates that RASSF1A has the prominent
roles to modulate and integrate a series of critical cellular processes
involved in tumor invasion and metastasis progression, including
EMT.
In conclusion, our study establishes that RASSF1A antagonizes
RhoA oncogenic activity by GTP-RhoA destabilization. RASSF1A
appears to evoke this key function by interacting directly with
RhoA and Smurf1, leading to the formation of a RhoA-destructing protein complex. RASSF1A thus represents one critical negative regulator of RhoA signaling, adding a new mechanism by
which RASSF1A functions as a tumor suppressor.
