ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death and most prevalent
cancer in men. The absence of curative options for castration-resistant metastatic
prostate cancer and biomarkers able to discriminate between indolent and aggressive
tumors contribute to these statistics. In this study, a DNA aptamer termed DML-7
was successfully selected against human PCa cell line DU145 by using the cell-based
systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method. The
selected aptamer DML-7 was found to internalize into target cells in a temperaturedependent manner and exhibit high binding affinity for target cells with dissociation
constants in the nanomolar range. Binding analysis further revealed that DML-7 only
binds to DU145 and PC-3 cells with metastatic potential, but not to LNCaP or 22Rv1
cells with low or nonmetastatic potential, demonstrating that DML-7 has excellent
selectivity for the recognition of the metastatic PCa cells. Clinical tissue imaging
further confirmed these results. Therefore, both high binding affinity and specificity to
metastatic PCa cells and tissues afford DML-7 with the potential for development into a
novel tool for diagnosis and targeted drug delivery against metastatic prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

aggressive and metastatic state refractory to androgen
deprivation, thus leading to high mortality [3]. Currently,
metastatic castration-resistant (androgen-independent)
prostate cancer remains incurable [4].
With the increase of PCa, the detection of PCa
is critically important to reduce mortality rate. Prostatespecific antigen (PSA) is the best-known biomarker, and
it is typically used for screening and diagnosis of PCa [5].
However, its use is controversial based on the lack of
specificity [6] in that increased PSA levels have been found
in benign prostatic hyperplasia [7] and prostatitis [8].
Meanwhile, numerous factors affect PSA levels, including
obesity, ejaculation, aspirin and various herbal mixtures [6].
False positives have resulted in unnecessary biopsy

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common
noncutaneous malignancy and the second leading cause
of cancer death in men in many western countries [1].
According to the National Cancer Institute, an
estimated 220,800 new cases will be diagnosed in the
coming year, while an estimated 27,540 men died from
prostate cancer in 2015 in the United States alone.
In the early stages, prostate cancer cells rely heavily
on androgens for continued oncogenic growth [2].
Accordingly, localized early-stage tumors can be treated
with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However,
patients with prostate cancer may progress to an

These facts call for the development of more effective
biomarkers for the detection of PCa.
Aptamers are short, single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) or RNA oligonucleotides able to fold into welldefined  three-dimensional structures through various
intramolecular interactions, followed by the formation
of stable and specific complexes with different targets
through complementary shape interaction [10, 11]. Similar
to protein antibodies, aptamers bind to their targets with
high affinity and specificity [12]. Typically, the binding
affinity of aptamers is in the nanomolar to picomolar range.
However, aptamers hold several attractive properties over
antibodies, such as low molecular weight, high stability,
easy and reproducible synthesis, lack of immunogenicity,
rapid tissue penetration, and low toxicity [13].
Aptamers are generated through an in vitro
iterative selection process known as SELEX (systematic
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). CellSELEX is a variant of the SELEX procedure using whole
living cells as targets for aptamer selection [14]. Based
on this method, cell-specific aptamers can be generated
without any prior knowledge about target cell surface
molecules, thereby allowing the aptamer’s binding target to
retain its native conformation. Up to now, many aptamers
have been generated by cell-SELEX against various cancer
cell lines, including leukemia [15], lung cancer [16], colon
cancer [17], hepatocellular carcinoma [18], ovarian cancer
[19], and gastric cancer [20]. These aptamers, which
have been applied in biomedical research for cancer cell
detection, cell capture, imaging, targeted therapy and
biomarker discovery, show potential for application in
early cancer diagnosis and targeted therapeutics.
In this study, we adopted the cell-SELEX strategy
to obtain a DNA aptamer, termed DML-7. DML-7 binds
to the classical DU145 metastatic prostate cancer cell line
with high affinity and can be internalized in a temperaturedependent manner. Binding analysis revealed that DML-7
only binds to DU145 and PC-3 cells with metastatic
potential, but not to LNCaP or 22Rv1 with low or
nonmetastastic potential, demonstrating that DML-7 holds
excellent selectivity for the recognition of the metastatic
PCa cells. Clinical tissue imaging further confirmed these
results. Therefore, both high binding affinity and specificity
to metastatic PCa cells and tissues afford DML-7 with the
potential for development into a novel tool for diagnosis
and targeted drug delivery against metastatic PCa.

human prostatic stromal myofibroblast cell line, WPMY-1,
was used as the negative control for counter-selection to
remove sequences binding to both target and control cell
lines. The cell-SELEX process is illustrated in Figure 1A.
For the first two selection rounds, only DU145 cells were
applied for positive selection to enrich ssDNA sequences,
to the extent possible, on target cells. Beginning with
the third round, the ssDNA pool was first incubated with
WPMY-1 cells to remove nonspecific sequences, and
then unbound DNA sequences were collected and further
incubated with target DU145 cells for positive selection.
The ssDNA pool collected after each round of selection
was amplified by PCR for next-round selection.
The enrichment of ssDNA pool during each
round of selection was monitored by flow cytometry.
The fluorescence intensity of the labeled cells reflected
the binding capacity of enriched pools. Indeed, with
increasing number of selection rounds, a steady increase
in fluorescence intensity on target DU145 cells was
observed (Figure 1B), indicating that ssDNA sequences
with better binding affinity to DU145 cells were enriched.
In contrast, no significant change of fluorescence intensity
on control WPMY-1 cells was observed (Figure 1C),
suggesting that the enriched ssDNA sequences were
specific to DU145 cells. By the 18th round of selection,
the maximum fluorescence intensity had been reached on
the DU145 cells (Figure 1B).

Identification of ssDNA aptamer candidates
binding to PCa cells
To identify individual aptamer binding to DU145
cells, ssDNA pool from the 18th round was sequenced
by a high-throughput sequencing device. Based on
their sequential repeatability, secondary structures and
homogeneity, the sequenced aptamer candidates were
classified into different groups. Ten representative
sequences from different groups were chosen and
synthesized for further characterization (Table 1). The
binding abilities of the selected sequences to target and
control cells were tested with flow cytometry. Interestingly,
one of ten sequences, termed DML-7, showed significant
binding to DU145 cells, rather than control cells, indicating
its specific recognition ability (Figure 2A and 2B).
To further determine the binding affinity of DML-7 to
DU145 cells, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd)
was evaluated. Accordingly, DU145 cells were incubated
with different concentrations of FAM-labeled DML-7
or initial library at 4°C for 45 minutes, followed by
monitoring fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry.
After subtracting the geometric mean fluorescence (GMF)
intensity of cells incubated with library in the highest
concentration from that of cells treated with DML-7, the
Kd of DML-7 for DU145 cells was calculated as Y = B max
X/(Kd +X). As shown in Figure 2C, the Kd of DML-7 for
DU145 cells is in the low nanomolar range, which is about

with high affinity to its cognate target.

[23, 24]. Therefore, identifying the receptor for this
aptamer ligand remains an open question worthy of further
investigation.

Determination of target type for aptamer DML-7

Internalization of DML-7 into DU145 cells

Aptamer binding specificity and sites were further
evaluated by confocal imaging using Cy5-labeled DML-7.
As shown in Figure 3A, intense fluorescence was
observed on the surface of DU145 cells, but not WPMY-1
cells, after incubation with DML-7. These results
demonstrate that DML-7 could selectively bind to the
surface of DU145 cells. However, to accurately elucidate
the cell surface receptor for this aptamer ligand, DU145
cells were treated with proteinase K or trypsin for a
short time respectively, before incubating the aptamer
with the treated cells. Neither treatment caused DML-7
to lose its binding ability to DU145 cells (Figure 3B).
The fact that proteinases, such as proteinase K and
trypsin, can remove membrane proteins on the cell
surface seems to suggest that aptamer DML-7 does not
target membrane proteins. However, it is worth noting
that some membrane proteins are highly resistant to
the digestion with trypsin or proteinase K [21, 22].
Also, post-translational modification of proteins, such as
glycosylation, often limits proteinase access to cleavage
sites, thus reinforcing resistance to proteinase digestion

Studies have shown that some aptamers can be
internalized inside living cells by endocytosis [25, 26].
Internalization is very important for the application of
aptamers in vivo, such as targeted drug delivery. Therefore,
to investigate the internalization capacity of DML-7,
DU145 cells were incubated with Cy5-labeled DML-7
and library at 4°C and 37°C for 2 h, respectively. Strong
fluorescence was observed on the periphery of DU145
cells after incubation with DML-7 at 4°C. However, after
incubation at 37°C, the fluorescence signal originated
from inside the cells, indicating that DML-7 had entered
cells. In contrast, DU145 cells displayed no significant
fluorescence signal when incubated with the unselected
DNA library at either 4°C or 37°C (Figure 4A and 4B).
These results demonstrated that DML-7 can be internalized
into DU145 cells in a temperature-dependent manner.

Binding characterization of DML-7 sequence

predicted by NUPACK (Figure 5A), the sequence of DML-

7 was truncated by gradually removing the nucleotides at
the 5′ and 3′ termini. Five truncated sequences, designating
DML-7a, DML-7b, DML-7c, DML-7d and DML-7e, were
listed in Table 2. Their binding ability to DU145 cells
was tested by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 5B
and 5C, all truncated sequences could bind to DU145, but
not WPMY-1cells, indicating that they retained specific
recognition ability to DU145 cells, even though sequences
were truncated. Compared with untruncated DML-7,
it should be noted that truncated sequences showed
different degrees of decreased binding affinity to DU145
cells (Figure 5B). Among these, DML-7d showed the
minimal influence on the binding ability. Thus, it can be
concluded that both forward and reverse primers may be
indispensable for successful DML-7 binding.

AR-negative PC-3 cells and AR-positive LNCaP and
22Rv1 cells. Interestingly, we found that DML-7 only
bound to AR-negative PC-3 cells, but not AR-positive
LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells (Figure 6A). It is well known
that AR plays a key role in the development, function
and homeostasis of the prostate and is, therefore, closely
associated with the development and progression of
PCa [27]. Previous studies have revealed that epithelial
AR may function as a suppressor of cell invasion
and metastasis [28]. Human clinical data from PCa
patients indicated that AR expression was significantly
decreased in metastatic PCa as compared to primary PCa.
Consistent with these studies, AR-negative PC-3 cells
have high metastatic potential compared to AR-positive
LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, which have low, or no, metastatic
potential [29]. Since DML-7 was generated by cellSELEX using AR-negative DU145 cells with metastatic
potential, it is reasonable to believe that the target protein
of DML-7 may be correlated with aggressiveness or
metastasis.

Specificity of DML-7 to other cell lines
To further characterize DML-7 binding to other
PCa cell lines, FAM-labeled DML-7 was incubated with

Although DML-7 was generated using PCa cells,
the possibility of recognizing other types of cancer cells
could not be excluded since its cell surface receptor
is unknown. Therefore, the selectivity of DML-7 was
further investigated with multiple cell lines of different
origins, including human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell
line PL45, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549,
human osteosarcoma cell line  U2OS, human Burkitt’s
lymphoma cell line Ramos, human acute lymphoblastic
leukemia cell line CEM and human chronic myelogenous
leukemia cell line K562. Among all tested cell lines, we
found that DML-7 bound PL45, A549 and U2OS cells, but
not cell lines with suspension features, including Ramos,
CEM and K562 (Figure 6B and 6C). These results indicate

that DML-7 may have the potential to recognize cancer
cell lines other than metastasis-specific DU145 and PC-3.

Imaging of clinical PCa tissues with DML-7
Since DML-7 shows high binding affinity for PCa
cells with metastatic potential, we speculate that DML-7
may also have the ability to recognize clinical metastatic
PCa tissues. To test this hypothesis, laser confocal
fluorescence microscopy was used to image a prostate
adenocarcinoma tissue microarray containing 40 cases of
prostate adenocarcinoma and 8 normal prostate tissues with
Cy5-labeled DML-7. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 7, all
8 normal prostate tissues and 85% (17/20) of nonmetastatic

PCa tissues displayed weak or negative fluorescence signal.
In contrast, all 20 cases of PCa tissues with metastasis
exhibited strong or moderate fluorescence signal. These
results indicate that DML-7 has strong binding and
recognition ability for clinical metastatic PCa tissues.
Although aptamer Wy-5a has already been generated
against PC-3 cells [30], DML-7 varies from Wy-5a by its
sequences, secondary structures and binding affinity. The
difference derives from the fact that we adopted prostate
cell line DU145 as target to obtain aptamer DML-7 by
cell-based SELEX. An analysis of target type implies that
the binding targets of DML-7 on the surface of PCa cells
may be completely different from those of Wy-5a. Unlike
Wy-5a, DML-7 binds two common metastatic prostate
cell lines, DU145 and PC-3, but not low or nonmetastatic
PCa cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1. More importantly, the
binding affinity of DU145 for clinical metastatic PCa
tissues is closely associated with metastasis.

sequence of 40 nucleotides (nt) flanked by 20-nt sequences
for primer annealing (5′-ACGCTCGGATGCCACTACAG40nt-CTCATGGACGTGCTGGTGAC-3′). A FAM-labeled
forward primer (5′-ACGCTCGGATGCCACTACAG-3′)
and a biotinylated (Bio) reverse primer (5′-GTCACCA
GCACGTCCATGAG-3′) were used in the PCR process for
the synthesis of double-strand DNA (dsDNA) sequences.

Cell-SELEX procedures
The Cell-SELEX process is nearly identical to that
described previously with a few modifications [31, 32].
We preformed the selection process using DU145 cells
as the target cells and WPMY-1 as the negative control
cells. For each round of SELEX, DU145 and WPMY1 cells were all cultured to 80%–90% confluence and
kept in a good state. For the first and second round of
SELEX, both cell lines were cultured in a 10 mm Petri
dish. About 10 nmol initial ssDNA library were dissolved
in 1.5 mL binding buffer. Before the process was carried
out, the ssDNA pool was denatured by heating at 95°C
for five minutes, followed by rapid cooling on ice to
ensure that the DNA sequences would adopt the most
favorable secondary structures. Then the DNA library
was incubated with DU145 cells cultured in a 10 cm
Petri dish at 4°C for 2 h. After discarding the supernatant
solution, the cells were washed twice with washing buffer
to remove unbound sequences. Afterwards, the cellbinding DNAs were harvested by heating at 95°C for 10
minutes and then centrifuging at 5000 rpm to remove cell
debris. The harvested DNA was then used as a template
and amplified by PCR with FAM-labeled forward primer
and biotin-labeled reverse primers. PCR was performed
by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes, 4–12 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 30 s annealing at 55.2°C, and 30 s extension at
72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C and 12°C thereafter.
PCR Taq polymerase and dNTPs were obtained from
Takara. FAM-labeled dsDNA was separated from the
PCR solution by streptavidin-coated sepharose beads
(GE Healthcare) and treated with 0.2 M of NAOH to get
the ssDNA. Finally, after lyophilization and desalting,
we obtained the ssDNA product for the next round of
selection.
From the third round, negative WPMY-1 cells in a 60
mm culture dish with 90% confluence were incubated with
the ssDNA evolved from the last round at 4°C for 30 min.
Nonspecific binders were removed and applied on DU145
cells to enrich the specific sequences. The positive
incubation time was shortened from 2 h to 1 h, and the
negative incubation time was gradually increased from
30 min to 2 h to increase the stringency of the selection
process. At the same time, washing times were also
increased from 2 to 3 times. In total, 18 rounds of selection
were performed before sequencing. The evolved ssDNA
pool was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq (Sangon
Biotech Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Human PCa cell lines DU145, LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3,
and human prostatic stromal myofibroblast cell line WPMY1 were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) cell bank (Shanghai, China).  Human pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma cell line PL45, human osteosarcoma
cell line U2OS, human lung cancer cell line A549, human
leukemic cell lines CEM and K562, and human Burkitt’s
lymphoma cell line Ramos were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines
were cultured at 37°C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2. 
DU145 cells were cultured in MEM medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 100 U/mL
penicillin-streptomycin (pen-strep). PL45 cells were cultured
in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
100 U/mL pen-strep. WPMY-1 cells were cultured in
DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 100 U/
mL pen-strep. LNCaP, PC-3, 22Rv1, U2OS, A549, CEM,
Ramos and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL pen-strep.

Buffer
Washing buffer was prepared by adding 5 mM of
Mgcl2 and 4.5 g/L of glucose into Dulbecco’s PhosphateBuffered Saline (D-PBS). Binding buffer was prepared by
adding 0.1 mg/mL of yeast tRNA and 1 mg/L of bovine
serum albumin (BSA) to washing buffer.

DNA synthesis and labeling
DNA used in the cell-SELEX was synthesized by
Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The ssDNA

aptamer concentration. Afterwards, results were fit as
Y = B max X/( Kd + X), using Origin8 software.

Aptamer enrichment was monitored using flow
cytometry. Target and negative cells were cultured in a
10mm dish with 80%~90% confluence, and cells were
dissociated by 0.02 EDTA after washing with D-PBS
twice. 3 × 105 DU145 cells or WPMY-1 cells were
incubated with 250 nM of FAM-labeled selected ssDNA
pools and initial library pools in 100 ul of binding buffer
at 4°C for 45 minutes. Before flow cytometric analysis
(BD FACSVerse™ flow cytometer), each sample was
washed three times with 500 uL of washing buffer and
then filtered with 500 uL binding buffer. All experiments
were repeated three times.

Using selected aptamer for human tumor tissue
staining
A PCa tissue array (US Biomax, Inc) was preheated
at 60°C for 2 h and then deparaffinized in xylene (15 min,
twice). Tissue sections were then immersed in decreasing
ethanol concentrations (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70%)
at 5 min intervals. The hydrated tissues were pretreated
in 0.01 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and heated in a pressure
cooker for 20 min. Afterwards, tissue sections were
blocked with precooled binding buffer, 20% FBS and
0.1 mg/ml Salmon Sperm DNA for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated with 250 nM Cy5-labeled library or aptamer
DML-7 at 4°C for 1 h. The signals were then detected
using FV10-ASW v.3.1 software (Olympus) and displayed
with an intensity scale ranging from 670 to 2940.

Confocal microscopy imaging
Confocal microscopy imaging was employed to
monitor the binding of aptamer to live cells. 1 × 105 cells
were seeded in a 35 mm glass bottom dish and cultured for
about 24 h. The cells were then incubated with FITC- or
Cy5-labeled aptamers at 4°C for 1 h after washing twice
with cold washing buffer. After again washing twice with
washing buffer, the cells were imaged by a FV1000-X81
confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). The images were
analyzed by FV10-ASW Version 3.1 software.

Proteinase treatment of cells
Positive DU145 cells cultured to 80%–90%
confluence were washed twice with D-PBS and then treated
with 200 uL 0.25% trypsin or 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K
for 3 minutes, followed by adding complete culture
medium to inhibit proteinase activity. Cells were then
washed with washing buffer, and the detached cells
were collected. The cells were incubated with 250
nM of aptamers in 100 uL of binding buffer at 4°C for
45 minutes. After washing with washing buffer, all cell
samples were tested by flow cytometry.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The authors affirm no conflicts of interest.

Internalization analysis 

REFERENCES

Internalization analysis was conducted by confocal
imaging. DU145 cells were incubated with 250 nM Cy5labeled DML-7 or initial library in MEM medium at 4°C
or 37°C for 2 h. Then, cells were washed three times with
washing buffer before imaging.
