ABSTRACT
Mechanisms underlying therapy resistance of tumor cells include protein kinase
Akt. Putative Akt targets include store-operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) accomplished by
pore forming ion channel unit Orai1 and its regulator STIM1. We explored whether
therapy resistant (A2780cis) differ from therapy sensitive (A2780) ovary carcinoma
cells in Akt, Orai1, and STIM1 expression, Ca2+-signaling and cell survival following
cisplatin (100µM) treatment. Transcript levels were quantified with RT-PCR, protein
abundance with Western blotting, cytosolic Ca2+-activity ([Ca2+]i) with Fura-2fluorescence, SOCE from increase of [Ca2+]i following Ca2+-readdition after Ca2+store depletion, and apoptosis utilizing flow cytometry. Transcript levels of Orai1
and STIM1, protein expression of Orai1, STIM1, and phosphorylated Akt, as well as
SOCE were significantly higher in A2780cis than A2780 cells. SOCE was decreased
by Akt inhibitor III (SH-6, 10µM) in A2780cis but not A2780 cells and decreased
in both cell lines by Orai1 inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-ABP, 50µM).
Phosphatidylserine exposure and late apoptosis following cisplatin treatment were
significantly lower in A2780cis than A2780 cells, a difference virtually abolished by
SH-6 or 2-ABP. In conclusion, Orai1/STIM1 expression and function are increased in
therapy resistant ovary carcinoma cells, a property at least in part due to enhanced
Akt activity and contributing to therapy resistance in those cells.

INTRODUCTION

STIM1 and Orai1 upregulate SOCE via activation
of Akt/mTOR in human pulmonary arterial smooth
muscle cells [21]. In addition Orai1 and thus SOCE is upregulated in both mast cells [22] and platelets [23] by the
serum & glucocorticoid inducible kinase SGK1, which
counteracts Orai1 degradation by the ubiquitin ligase
Nedd4-2 [22] and stimulates NF-κB dependent Orai1
transcription [24]. SGK1 targets are in large part shared
by PKB/Akt isoforms [25]. Thus, it is feasible that Orai1
is similarly regulated by PKB/Akt isoforms.
The present study explored whether Orai1 and
STIM1 are expressed in ovary carcinoma cells and
whether their expression and function differs between
therapy resistant and therapy sensitive ovary carcinoma
cells. To this end, Orai1 and STIM1 transcript and protein
expression, SOCE as well as apoptosis following cisplatin

Cytosolic Ca2+ activity participates in the regulation
of a variety of fundamental cellular mechanisms including
excitation, exocytosis, migration, cell proliferation and
cell death [1-5]. Mechanisms contributing to the regulation
of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration include Ca2+ release from
intracellular stores and subsequent activation of store
operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) or Ca2+ release activated
Ca2+ channel ICRAC, which are accomplished by the pore
forming Ca2+ channel subunits Orai1, Orai2 and/or Orai3
[6-10] as well as their regulators STIM1 and/or STIM2
[11-15]. Orai1 and STIM1 are expressed in tumor cells
and may well contribute to the survival of therapy resistant
cells [16-20].

treatment were determined in therapy resistant and therapy
sensitive ovary carcinoma cells.

in Fig. 2, the Orai1 and STIM1 protein expression was
significantly higher in therapy resistant A2780cis than in
therapy sensitive A2780 ovary carcinoma cells.
Fura-2-fluorescence was employed in order to test
whether the differences in Orai1 and STIM1 transcript
levels and protein abundance were paralleled by
corresponding differences in store operated Ca2+ entry.
The Fura-2-fluorescence ratio prior to extracellular Ca2+
removal was similar in therapy sensitive A2780 (0.298 ±
0.003 a.u., n = 7) and therapy resistant A2780cis (0.309
± 0.003 a.u., n = 7) ovary carcinoma cells. Addition of
the store-depleting sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (1 µM) triggered
release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, leading to rapid,
transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ activity. The increase
of intracellular Ca2+ concentration following thapsigargin
treatment was again similar in therapy sensitive A2780
and therapy resistant A2780cis ovary carcinoma cells
(Fig. 3). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the subsequent addition
of extracellular Ca2+ was followed by a rapid increase
of Fura-2-fluorescence in both cell types reflecting store
operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Both, peak and slope of
SOCE were significantly higher in therapy resistant
A2780cis than in therapy sensitive A2780 ovary carcinoma
cells. The Orai1 inhibitor 2-APB (50 µM) decreased the
peak Ca2+ increase from 0.19 ± 0.02 arbitrary units (n =
6) to 0.07 ± 0.01 arbitrary units (n = 5) in A2780 ovary
carcinoma cells and from 0.49 ± 0.03 arbitrary units (n =
6) to 0.04 ± 0.01 arbitrary units (n = 5) A2780cis ovary
carcinoma cells (Fig. 4).
Additional experiments attempted to elucidate
mechanisms accounting for the differences in Orai1 and
STIM1 abundance as well as SOCE between therapy

RESULTS
RT-PCR was employed to explore whether ovary
carcinoma cells transcribe Orai1 and/or STIM1 and
whether the transcript levels are different between therapy
sensitive A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis ovary
carcinoma cells. As illustrated in Fig.1, both cell lines
express Orai1 and STIM1. The transcript levels were,
however, significantly higher in therapy resistant A2780cis
than in therapy sensitive A2780 ovary carcinoma cells.
In line with the differences in Orai1 and STIM1
transcript levels, Western blotting analysis revealed similar
differences in protein abundance. Indeed, as illustrated

sensitive and therapy resistant ovary carcinoma cells.

resistant A2780cis and therapy sensitive A2780 ovary
carcinoma cells. A candidate kinase was Akt. Thus,
Western blotting analysis was employed to test whether
Akt and p-Akt are differentially expressed in therapy

resistant A2780cis and in therapy sensitive A2780 ovary
carcinoma cells. As a result, the protein abundance of
p-Akt/Akt was indeed significantly higher in therapy
resistant A2780cis than in therapy sensitive A2780 ovary
carcinoma cells (Fig. 5). To further analyze whether
Akt activity was required for the differences in SOCE,
Fura-2-fluorescence experiments were performed in the
absence and presence of Akt inhibitor III (SH-6) (Fig.
4). Pretreatment with SH-6 (10 µM) did not significantly
modify the Fura-2-fluorescence of therapy sensitive
A2780 (0.35 ± 0.01 a.u., n = 6) and therapy resistant
A2780cis (0.35 ± 0.01 a.u., n = 6) ovary carcinoma cells
prior to triggering of SOCE. Moreover, the increase in
cytosolic Ca2+ activity following addition of thapsigargin
(1 µM) was in both cell types similar in the absence and
presence of SH-6 (Fig. 4). However, the rapid increase
of Fura-2-fluorescence following subsequent addition of
extracellular Ca2+ was in therapy resistant A2780cis but
not in therapy sensitive A2780 cells significantly blunted
by SH-6 (Fig. 4). In the presence of SH-6 no statistically
significant difference was observed in SOCE between
therapy sensitive A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis
ovary carcinoma cells.
In order to further explore the influence of Akt
on SOCE, intracellular Ca2+ release and SOCE were
determined in therapy sensitive ovary carcinoma cells
transfected with constitutively active Akt or inactive
Akt. As illustrated in Fig. 6, SOCE was significantly
higher following transfection with constitutively active
(T308DS473D) Akt than following transfection with
inactive (T308AS473A) Akt.
In order to test whether Akt sensitive regulation of
Orai1 influenced the sensitivity of the ovary carcinoma
cells to therapy, the effect of cisplatin on apoptosis of
therapy sensitive A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis
cells was tested in the absence and presence of either Akt

inhibitor SH-6 or Orai1 inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl
borate (2-APB). As illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8,
A2780cis cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by
cisplatin when compared with sensitive cells. Both SH-6
(10 µM) and 2-ABP (50 µM) restored cisplatin sensitivity
of resistant cells significantly to levels comparable with
those observed in sensitive cells.

pharmacological inhibition of either Akt or Orai1
augmented cisplatin induced apoptosis of therapy resistant
A2780cis ovary carcinoma cells and virtually abrogated
the differences in cisplatin sensitivity between therapy
sensitive A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis ovary
carcinoma cells.
The Ca2+ channel units Orai1, 2, or 3 [6-9] and their
regulators STIM 1 or 2 [12, 13, 15] have been implicated
in the resistance to apoptosis, in proliferation, and in
migration of tumor cells [16-20, 26-34]. In cervical cancer
cells STIM1 silencing abrogates proliferation and induces
cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phase [32]. SOCE may
trigger Ca2+ oscillations [35] which regulate a wide variety
of cellular functions [36-40] including entering into the S
and the M phase of the cell cycle [41, 42] and confering
tumor cell survival [43, 44].
In contrast to oscillating cytosolic Ca2+ activity,
a sustained increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity leads
to apoptosis [38, 40, 45-53]. Thus, survival of tumor

DISCUSSION
The present study disclosed the expression of
Orai1 and STIM1 in both, therapy sensitive A2780 and
therapy resistant A2780cis ovary carcinoma cells. More
importantly, the present observations revealed that
expression of both, Orai1 and STIM1, was significantly
higher in therapy resistant A2780cis than in therapy
sensitive A2780 ovary carcinoma cells. The increased
expression of Orai1 and STIM1 was paralleled by
corresponding differences in store operated Ca2+ entry
(SOCE) in those cells. The enhanced Orai1/STIM1
expression and activity was paralleled by enhanced p-Akt
protein abundance and abrogated by the Akt inhibitor
SH-6. Along those lines, transfection with active Akt
was followed by increase of SOCE. Most importantly,

cells may depend on the delicate machinery underlying
oscillating cytosolic Ca2+ activity.
Ample evidence has previously been gathered on a
role of Akt1 in stimulation of proliferation, inhibition of
apoptosis and establishment of therapy resistance [54-62].
Interestingly, Akt1 phosphorylation has previously been
shown to be suppressed by SOCE and to be up-regulated
by inhibition of Orai1 expression [63]. Thus, the mutual
regulation of Akt1 and Orai1 may be part of a negative
feedback.
Orai1/STIM1 is known to be up-regulated by the
related serum & glucocorticoid inducible kinase [22,
24]. Similar to Akt1, SGK1 is highly expressed in a wide
variety of tumor cells [64-67]. SGK1 stimulates cell
proliferation and confers cell survival [68-72] and thus
actively participates in regulation of tumor growth [65, 7375]. However, we did not observe significant differences

in SGK1 protein abundance between therapy sensitive
A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis ovary carcinoma
cells (Suppl. Fig.1). Moreover, the specific SGK1 inhibitor
EMD638683 [76] did not significantly affect SOCE
in therapy resistant A2780cis ovary carcinoma cells
and did not abrogate the differences in SOCE between
therapy sensitive A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis
ovary carcinoma cells (Suppl. Fig.2). Thus, under the
experimental conditions chosen, Akt1 rather than SGK1
contributes to the therapy resistance of A2780cis ovary
carcinoma cells.
The present observations reveal that Akt1 sensitive
up-regulation of Orai1 contributes to or even accounts
for cisplatin resistance of ovary carcinoma cells. The
combined application of cisplatin with Akt1 inhibitors or
Orai1 inhibitors may thus overcome therapy resistance
of ovary carcinoma. Moreover, the same or similar

mechanisms may be operative in other tumor cell types.
Different Akt isoforms [77-79], SGK isoforms [65, 80],
Orai/STIM isoforms [81-83] or other Ca2+ channels
[84-89] may confer survival and thus establish therapy
resistance of other tumor cell types. The combination of
cytostatic therapy or radiation with the respective kinase
or channel inhibitors may thus be a novel therapeutic
approach to overcome therapy resistance of tumors.
In conclusion, Orai1 is expressed in therapy
sensitive A2780 and therapy resistant A2780cis ovary
carcinoma cells. Orai1 transcript levels, Orai1 protein
abundance and store operated Ca2+ entry are all higher
in therapy resistant A2780cis than in therapy sensitive
A2780 ovary carcinoma cells. The difference in SOCE
between therapy resistant and therapy sensitive ovary

carcinoma cells is paralleled by and at least partially due to
upregulation of Orai1 by Akt. Akt dependent upregulation
of SOCE contributes to or even accounts for the therapy
resistance.

Cell culture
Experiments were performed in cisplatin-resistant
cells (A2780cis) and their therapy sensitive parent cell
(A2780) (ECACC catalogue no. 93112519). A2780cis has
been generated by exposure to increasing concentrations of
cisplatin and is further resistant to melphalan, adriamycin
and irradiation [90-92]. The cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s RPMI media, containing 10% fetal calf serum
and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from ovary carcinoma
cells in TriFast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. After DNAse digestion
reverse transcription of total RNA was performed using
Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the respective genes were set
up in a total volume of 20 µl using 40 ng of cDNA, 500
nM forward and reverse primer and 2x GoTaq® qPCR
Master Mix (Promega,Hilden, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Cycling conditions were as
follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed
by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 58°C for 15 sec and 68°C
for 20 sec. For amplification the following primers were
used (5`->3`orientation):
for Orai1:
fw: CGTATCTAGAATGCATCCGGAGCC
rev: CAGCCACTATGCCTAGGTCGACTAGC
for STIM1:
fw: CCTCGGTACCATCCATGTTGTAGCA
rev: GCGAAAGCTTACGCTAAAATGGTGTCT
for Tbp:
fw: GCCCGAAACGCCGAATAT
rev: CCGTGGTTCGTGGCTCTCT
Specificity of PCR products was confirmed by
analysis of a melting curve. Real-time PCR amplifications
were performed on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad)
and all experiments were done in duplicate. The housekeeping gene Tbp (TATA binding protein) was amplified
to standardize the amount of sample RNA. Relative
quantification of gene expression was achieved using the
ΔCT method as described earlier [93, 94].

Ca2+ measurements
Fura-2 fluorescence was utilized to determine
intracellular Ca2+ concentrations [97]. Cells were loaded
with Fura-2/AM (2 µM, Invitrogen, Goettingen, Germany)
for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were excited alternatively at 340
nm and 380 nm through an objective (Fluor 40×/1.30 oil)
built in an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Axiovert
100, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Emitted fluorescence
intensity was recorded at 505 nm. Data were acquired
using specialized computer software (Metafluor, Universal
Imaging, Downingtown, USA). Cytosolic Ca2+ activity
was estimated from the 340 nm/380 nm ratio. SOCE was
determined by extracellular Ca2+ removal and subsequent
Ca2+ readdition in the presence of thapsigargin (1 µM,
Invitrogen) [99]. For quantification of Ca2+ entry, the
slope (delta ratio/s) and peak (delta ratio) were calculated
following readdition of Ca2+.
	 Experiments were performed with Ringer
solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2
MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 2 Na2HPO4, 32 HEPES, 5 glucose, pH
7.4. To reach nominally Ca2+-free conditions, experiments
were performed using Ca2+-free Ringer solution containing
(in mM): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2 Na2HPO4, 32
HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 5 glucose, pH 7.4.

Determination of apoptosis
To determine apoptosis, 105 cells/100μl in complete
DMEM were incubated in 70% ethanol (molecular grade,
Sigma) on ice for 30 minutes, centrifuged at 1600 RPM
for 3 minutes at 4oC, added to 200μl of hypotonic buffer
(0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% triton X-100, 2mM CaCl2,
20U/ml RNAse A in deionized water) together with 24μl/

propidium iodide (Mabtag, Germany) as well as incubated
on ice in the dark for 60 minutes. The cells were washed
