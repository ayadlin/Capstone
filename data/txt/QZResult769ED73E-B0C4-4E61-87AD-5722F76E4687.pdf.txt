ABSTRACT
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is persistently
activated in human liver and colon cancer cells and is required for cancer cell viability,
survival and migration. Therefore, inhibition of STAT3 signaling may be a viable
therapeutic approach for these two cancers. We recently designed a non-peptide
small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, LY5, using in silico site-directed Fragment-based drug
design (FBDD). The inhibitory effect on STAT3 phosphorylation, cell viability, migration
and colony forming ability by LY5 were examined in human liver and colon cancer
cells. We demonstrated that LY5 inhibited constitutive Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced
STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 nuclear translocation, decreased STAT3 downstream
targeted gene expression and induced apoptosis in liver and colon cancer cells. LY5
had little effect on STAT1 phosphorylation mediated by IFN-γ. Inhibition of persistent
STAT3 phosphorylation by LY5 also inhibited colony formation, cell migration, and
decreased the viability of liver cancer and colon cancer cells. Furthermore, LY5
inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and suppressed colon tumor growth in a mouse
model in vivo. Our results suggest that LY5 is a potent STAT3 inhibitor and may be a
potential drug candidate for liver and colon cancer therapy.

survival rate of 9% and a median survival time of less than
1 year. Recent data indicate that the mortality of HCC in
China has been increasing [1]. Colorectal carcinoma is the
third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States. According to the American Cancer Society, there
will be an estimated 134,490 new cases and 49,190 deaths

Primary liver cancer is the fifth most common
human cancer, has a high incidence rate and poor
prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for
more than 85% of all primary liver cancers, with a 5-year

due to colorectal cancer in the United States in 2016 [2].
Therefore, there is a critical need for better approaches to
treatment for these types of cancers.
The cellular mechanisms contributing to colorectal
and liver cancer are not well understood but involve
signaling protein dysregulation, including the persistent
activation of STAT3. STAT3 is a transcription factor
and oncogenic driver that promotes malignancy [3].
In contrast to normal cells where activation of STAT3
is only transient due to a host of endogenous protein
regulators (e.g., PIAS, SOCS), aberrant and constitutive
activation of STAT3 has been detected in a wide variety
of human cancers, including solid tumors as well as
blood malignancies [4]. Phosphorylation of Tyr705 in
STAT3 leads to dimerization, nuclear translocation,
recognition of STAT3-specific DNA binding elements and
up-regulation of various STAT3 downstream target genes,
such as Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Survivin, c-Myc, cyclin D1, and
others [5]. Interestingly, no obvious deleterious effects
were observed when STAT3 antisense therapy was used
to deplete it from normal cells in mice [6]. In contrast to
STAT3 activation in normal cells, constitutive activation of
STAT3 stimulates tumor cell proliferation and migration,
mediates immune evasion, promotes angiogenesis, and
confers resistance to apoptosis induced by conventional
therapies [7, 8]. The finding that persistent activation of
STAT3 is dispensable for normal cells but is essential
for the development and progression of tumors strongly
suggests that STAT3 could be a potential therapeutic target
for cancers. Growing evidence has shown that blockade
of constitutively activated STAT3 can cause apoptosis and
decrease proliferation and cell migration in vitro [9–12],
inhibit tumor growth in vivo [13–16], as well as enhance
the sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [17–20].
Persistent activation of STAT3 signaling is
frequently detected in colon [21] and liver cancers [22, 23].
Constitutive STAT3 activation in colorectal cancer cells
is correlated with invasion, survival, and growth of
colorectal cancer cells in a colorectal tumor model in
mice in vivo [24, 25]. Persistent STAT3 activation in liver
cancer cells is also associated with invasion, survival,
proliferation, and tumorigenesis of liver cancer cells
[9, 10, 14, 26]. These reports indicate that STAT3 is one of
the major oncogenic pathways activated in colorectal and
liver cancers and can serve as a viable therapeutic target
for these two cancer types. To directly target persistent
STAT3 signaling in cancer cells, we recent developed
a novel small molecular STAT3 inhibitor LY5, which
was derived from LLL12 by an in silico site-directed
Fragment-based drug design [27]. Fragment-based drug
design method was used to identify the fragments from
several known STAT3 inhibitors which target the STAT3
Src homolog 2 (SH2) domain. STAT3 fragment libraries
were built from several known inhibitors and divided into
two speciﬁc sub-libraries for the pTyr705 site and the side
pocket site based on the docking poses of the inhibitors
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to the STAT3 SH2 domain. During LY5 drug design,
we chose the fragment for the pTyr 705 site of
LLL12 which had the lowest IC50 among the known
nonpeptidomimetic small inhibitors and the fragment
for the side pocket of ISS219. In order to maintain their
poses in the binding sites and reduce synthesis difficulty,
we chose dimethyl amine as the linker and merged the
two chosen fragments. The aforementioned fragments that
specifically bound to each of the two STAT3 SH2 binding
sites, pTyr705 and the side pocket, were selected and
linked to form the novel compound, LY5, whose formal
chemical name is 5, 8-dioxo-6-(pyridin-3-ylamino)-5,
8-dihydronaphthalene-1- sulfonamide [27].
We evaluated the inhibitory effects of LY5 on
constitutive and inducible STAT3 phosphorylation and the
expression of its downstream target genes in colon cancer
cells and liver cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that blockade of persistent STAT3 signaling inhibited
proliferation, cell migration and colony formation, as
well as induced apoptosis in liver and colon cancer cells.
Moreover, LY5 suppressed colon tumor growth in a mouse
xenograft model.

RESULTS
LY5 inhibited persistent STAT3 phosphorylation
and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells
LY5 (Figure 1A) was docked into the crystal
structure of STAT3 protein by software Autodock4. The
structure in ribbon and surface mode demonstrating how
LY5 interacts with STAT3 is shown in Figure 1B and 1C.
LY5 formed three hydrogen bonds with the STAT3 SH2
domain, with residues Arg609, Ser613 and Ser636. It was
predicted that LY5 could fit into the two major binding
sites, the pTyr705 and the side pocket site, so that it could
inhibit both STAT3 phosphorylation and dimerization. To
confirm this, we first examined whether LY5 inhibits
constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in colon and liver
cancer cells. HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with
LY5. LLL12, a previously developed STAT3 inhibitor
was included as a comparison. LY5 inhibited persistent
STAT3 phosphorylation at lower concentrations (1.0 μM)
than LLL12 (Figure 1D). LY5 exhibited greater potency
than LLL12 when dissolved in the same DMSO
concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary
Table S1). Therefore, LY5 has better water solubility than
LLL12. After treatment with LY5 for 24 hours, LY5 also
inhibited persistent STAT3 phosphorylation and induced
cleaved capase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis, in SW480 and
DLD1 colon cancer cells (Figure 1E).

cells

not inhibited significantly in these cells with the same
concentrations of LY5 that inhibited the phosphorylation
of STAT3 (Figure 3C and 3D). These data indicated
that LY5 selectively inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation
stimulation by IL-6.

Persistent STAT3 phosphorylation in SSMC
7721, Huh7, HEPG2, and Hep3B liver cancer cell lines
were inhibited after treatment with LY5 for 24 hours
(Figure 2A–2D). Furthermore, LY5 had no effect on the
overall expression of STAT3 (Figure 2A–2D).
The expression of STAT3 target genes, Survivin,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, were decreased in SSMC 7721, Huh7,
HEPG2 and Hep3B liver cancer cells after treatment with
LY5 as examined by Western Blot (Figure 2A–2D). Our
results also showed that LY5 induced the cleavage of
caspase-3, indicating apoptosis in these liver cancer cells
(Figure 2A–2D).

LY5 inhibited cell viability and decreased colony
formation
In HCT116, SW480 and DLD1 colon cancer cells,
treatment with LY5 for 24 hours resulted in a dramatic
decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4A). A dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability
in Hep3B, Huh7, and SMCC 7721 liver cancer cells
was also observed after treatment with LY5 for 24 hours
(Figure 4B). The IC50 values for LY5 were 1.637 to 3.347
µmol/L in liver cancer cells and 1.235 to 1.690 µmol/L in
colon cancer cells (Supplementary Table S2).
Our results demonstrated that LY5 remarkably
reduced the colony formation capacity in Huh7 and
Hep3B liver cancer cell lines (Figure 4C). An MTT
assay confirmed that the ability of LY5 to inhibit
colony formation is not due to induction of cell death
(Supplementary Figure S3A, S3B).

LY5 inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3
phosphorylation and did not affect IFN-γ
induced STAT1 phosphorylation
Our results showed that IL-6 stimulated STAT3
phosphorylation on tyrosine 705 in DLD1 and Hep3B
cancer cells. The induction of STAT3 phosphorylation by
IL-6 was inhibited by LY5 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3A and 3B). Thus, LY5 is capable of inhibiting
IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Total STAT3 was
not affected by the treatment of LY5 (Figure 3A and 3B).
We further investigated whether LY5 inhibits STAT1
phosphorylation mediated by IFN-γ. The results showed
that the phosphorylation and expression of STAT1 were

LY5 inhibited cell migration
We next evaluated the effect of LY5 on cell
migration by using wound healing assays in Hep3B and
Huh7 liver cancer cells. Our results showed that treatment
with 2.5 μM and 5 μM of LY5 caused a dose-dependent
decrease in cell migration (Figure 4D–4G). A cell viability

staining and induced apoptosis by using TUNEL
assay in xenograft tumors (Figure 6C). These results
demonstrated that inhibition of STAT3 by LY5 resulted
in the suppression of tumor growth in mice, suggesting
LY5 might be a potent compound in suppressing tumor
growth in vivo.

LY5 inhibited STAT3 nuclear translocation in
liver and colon cancer cells

DISCUSSION

In Hep3B and DLD1 cells treated with IL-6, STAT3
was phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus.
However, in cells pretreated with LY5 (5 μM), most of the
STAT3 was retained in cytoplasm (Figure 5). Additionally,
IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus,
which was blocked by LY5 pre-treatment in Hep3B liver
cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S4). Our data also
revealed that p-STAT3 constantly localizes in the nuclei
of HCT116, SW480, 7721, Huh7, HEPG2 and Hep3B
cells in 10% FBS without IL-6 stimulation. The nuclear
localization of p-STAT3 in these cell lines can be inhibited
by LY5 (Supplementary Figures S5–S10). Therefore,
these results demonstrated that the inhibition of STAT3
phosphorylation by LY5 impaired STAT3 transcriptional
function in liver and colon cancer cells by blocking
nuclear translocation.

STAT3, a member of the STAT family of
transcription factors, is frequently activated in many types
of cancers including liver and colon cancers [4, 28, 29].
STAT3 has been classified as an oncogene because
activated STAT3 can stimulate oncogenic transformation
in cultured cells and tumor formation in nude mice
[3, 30]. In contrast, STAT3 deficient fibroblasts were
shown to be resistant to transformation by a variety
of oncogenes [31, 32]. STAT3 activation results in the
expression of downstream target genes, such as cyclin
D1, Survivin, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2, which promote cell
proliferation and resistance to apoptosis [28, 30, 33, 34].
In addition, persistent STAT3 signaling also stimulates
tumor cell migration, mediates immune evasion, and
promotes angiogenesis, which contribute to oncogenesis.
The crucial role of STAT3 in cancer progression and
tumorigenesis makes STAT3 a viable molecular target for
cancer therapy [4, 29, 33].
Previous methods aimed at blocking persistent
STAT3 signaling have been reported including
phosphopeptide mimics, DNA decoys, dominant-negative
STAT3 mutants, STAT3 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs),
and anti-sense STAT3 oligonucleotides [27]. In addition,
non-peptide small molecule STAT3 inhibitors have
been developed, including WP1066 [35–37], S3I-201
[38, 39], STA-21 [40], Stattic [41, 42], and SD-1029
[43]. However, since there are no STAT3 targeting drugs

LY5 suppressed tumor growth of colon cancer
cells in vivo
Finally, we tested the effect of LY5 on suppressing
HCT116 colon cancer cells in nude mice xenograft
models in vivo. As shown in Figure 6A, LY5 suppressed
tumor growth compared to the vehicle-treated controls
in HCT116 xenografted mice (P < 0.05). LY5 inhibited
STAT3 but not Akt phosphorylation, decreased BCL-2 and
induced caspase-3 cleavage, indicating apoptosis in vivo
(Figure 6B). LY5 also inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation,
decreased the expression of Bcl-2 as shown by IHC

apoptosis in 7721 (A), Huh7 (B), HEPG2 (C) and Hep3B (D) liver cancer cell lines. The expression of STAT3 downstream
genes, Survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, was detected by western blot after treated with LY5 for 24 hours.

in clinical trials beyond Phase II, the development of
more potent and selective compounds that target STAT3
in cancer cells is still needed. We recently developed a
novel small molecule STAT3 inhibitor LY5 using in silico
site-directed Fragment-based drug design. In this study,
we evaluated the inhibitory efficacy of LY5 in liver and
colon cancer cells with persistent STAT3 signaling. The
results demonstrate that LY5 is capable of inhibiting
STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. LY5
inhibited STAT3 downstream target genes Bcl-2, Bcl-xl
and Survivin, resulting in the induction of apoptosis.
In addition to its anti-apoptotic function, STAT3 also
stimulates proliferation and cell migration. The results
indicated that LY5 inhibited cell viability, colony-forming
ability, and cell migration. Water solubility is an important
property of synthetic small molecules and for drug
development. We found LY5 has better water solubility
and a more potent inhibitory effect on cell viability
than LLL12, a previously developed STAT3 inhibitor,
which LY5 was derived from. In this and other studies,
we found LY5 has better water solubility and better
in vivo PK profile than LLL12. Our previous data have
indicated that the potency of LLL12 was higher than that
of previously reported STAT3 inhibitors (such as LLL3,
WP1066, Stattic, and S3I-201) in human cancer cells
[5]. So LY5 may be a good candidate agent having better
chance than several other non-peptide small molecule
inhibitors mentioned above to suppressing cancer cells by
targeting STAT3.
LY5 inhibits persistent STAT3 phosphorylation as
well as IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Several
pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immune cells have
been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation and tumor
growth and progression. Increased expression of IL-6 is
thought to act as a link between chronic inflammation and
tumor development [44]. IL-6 stimulates the progression
of colon and liver cancers and elevated IL-6 levels are
associated with poor prognosis in liver and colon cancers
[45–47]. IL-6 stimulates STAT3 phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of STAT3 to promote oncogenesis
by inhibiting apoptosis. STAT3 phosphorylation could
be blocked by LY5 in a dose-dependent manner. We also
examined whether LY5 inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation
induced by IFN-γ. Our results showed LY5 did not
affect the phosphorylation and expression of STAT1
in these cells suggesting it selectively inhibits STAT3
phosphorylation.
In addition, LY5 suppresses tumor growth in
HCT116 colon cancer xenografts mice. These results
suggest that LY5 alone or in combination with another
chemotherapeutic agent may be effective in suppressing
tumor cell growth in cancer patients with constitutive
STAT3 signaling. Based on our findings, treatment with
LY5 produces both anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effects. LY5 has the potential to become a drug candidate
for targeting cancer cells with constitutively activated
STAT3 due to its ability to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and suppress growth. Thus, LY5 deserves to be further
developed as a potential drug candidate for liver and colon
cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human liver and colon cancer cell lines
Human liver cancer cell lines (SSMC 7721, Huh7,
HEPG2, Hep3B) and colon cancer cell lines (HCT116,
SW480, DLD1) were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium /high glucose supplemented
with 10% FBS (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
All cancer cell lines were cultured in a humidiﬁed 37°C
incubator with 5% CO2.

STAT3 inhibitors
Small molecular STAT3 inhibitors LY5 and LLL12
were synthesized in Dr. Chenglong Li’s laboratory at the
College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University.

Cell viability assay
MTT cell viability assay Kits were purchased from
Promoter Biotechnology Ltd. Liver and colon cancer
cells (5000/well in 96-well plates) were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin for 24 hours. Then cells were treated with
different concentrations of LY5 in triplicate well at
37°C for 24 hours. MTT viability assay was performed
according to manufacturer’s protocol (Promoter
Biotechnology Ltd). The absorbance (A) was read at
570 nm. Cell viability was calculated as follows: (A of
LY5 group-A of blank group/A of DMSO group-A of
blank group) × 100%.

Colony formation
Cells were grown in six-well cell culture plates
and were treated with varying concentrations of LY5
for 6 hours. Viable cells were determined by trypan
blue staining and counted. A low cell density of viable
cells (104 /plate) were then seeded on 10 cm plates and
continued to grow for two to three weeks. Cells were
washed with PBS twice and fixed with cold methanol for
15 min. After fixation, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal
violet (25% methanol) at room temperature for 10 min.
After the staining, the plates were rinsed with distilled
water and dried.

Western blot analysis
Cancer cells were treated with LY5 (1.0, 2.5 μM, 5 μM)
or DMSO for 24 hours. After the treatments, cells were
12923

collected. For IL-6 and IFN-γ stimulation experiments,
DLD1 and Hep3B cells were serum-starved for 12 hours
and pretreated with LY5 (1.0, 2.5 μM, and/or 5 μM),
or DMSO for 2 hours. Then, 50 ng/ml IL-6 or IFN-γ
was added, and the cells were harvested 30 minutes
later. IL-6 and IFN-γ were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology. The collected cells were washed
with cold PBS and lysed on ice in a modiﬁed RIPA
buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF),
subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred
onto PVDF membrane and probed with antibodies
(Cell Signaling Tech.). Membranes were probed with a
1:1000 dilution of primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Tech.)
against phospho-speciﬁc STAT3 (Tyrosine 705, #9131),
phospho-independent STAT3 (#4904), phospho-speciﬁc
ERK1/2 (Threonine 202/ Tyrosine 204, #4370),
phospho-speciﬁc Akt (Threonine 308, #9275), cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175, #9661), Bcl-2 (#2876), Suvivin,
Bcl-xl (#2762), cyclinD1 (#2922) and GAPDH (#2118).
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. The speciﬁc proteins were detected
using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western
Blotting kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates
with Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium /high glucose
containing 10% FBS. After the cells reached 100%
conﬂuence, the monolayer was scratched using a 10-ul
pipette tip and washed once to remove non-adherent cells.
Cells were treated with DMSO, 2.5 μmol/L, and 5 μmol/L
of LY5 in the presence of 10% FBS for 2 hours. After that,
the medium was replaced and fresh medium supplemented
with 10% FBS was added. After additional 24–48 hours
without LY5 treatment, the cells were observed under the
microscope. When the wound in the DMSO control was
closed, the inhibition of cell migration was assessed by
using the ImageJ software, available from the NIH website
(http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The % of wound healed was
calculated using the formula: 100 - (final area/initial area
× 100%).

Mouse xenograft tumor model
Human colon cancer cell line, HCT116 (107 cells
in 100 μL of sterile PBS and matrigel), were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank region of female
athymic nude mice (4 to 6 weeks of age, 18–22 grams).
After tumor development, mice were divided into two
treatment groups (n = 6 each): (I) dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) as vehicle control and (II) 5 mg/kg of LY5
(dissolved in 10% DMSO, 18% Cremophor EL and 72%
sterile 5% dextrose). Vehicle and LY5 were administered
via intraperitoneal injection once daily for 11 days.
Tumor growth was determined by measuring the length
(L) and width (W) of the tumor every other day with a
caliper. And tumor volume was calculated on the basis
of the following formula: volume = (π/6)*L*W2. The
tumors were harvested after mice was killed, snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Tumors tissue
homogenates were lysed and separated by SDS-PAGE.
A portion of tumor tissues were fixed by using formalin
and embedded in paraffin. The expression of STAT3, its
downstream target genes Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase 3 in
xenograft tumors was examined by Western Blot assay.
The expression of P-STAT3 (Y705) and Bcl-2 was also
examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.
TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling) assay was used to detect the percentage
of apoptosis in xenograft tumors.

Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Cells were seeded on sterile glass slides and grown
for 24 hours. The next day, cells were treated with LY5
for 24 hours. For nuclear translocation experiment,
after serum-free overnight Hep3B and DLD1 cells were
pre-treated with LY5 for 2 hours, then IL-6 was added for
another 30 minutes. After the treatments, the cells were
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
buffer, and were fixed with ice-cold methanol at room
temperature for 15 minutes. After two washings with
ice-cold PBS buffer, the cells were permeabilized
and blocked with PBS buffer containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 and 5% normal goat serum at room temperature
for at least 1 hour. Then the cells were probed with the
polyclonal rabbit antibody to phosphorylated STAT3 or
total STAT3 (1:50 dilution, 1:100 dilution respectively)
at 4°C overnight. After the over night incubation, the
cells were washed with PBS buffer containing 0.1%
Tween-20. The cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Alexa Fluor Dye
(1:100, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG) anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Molecule Probe, Invitrogen) at room
temperature for 1 hour. The cells were mounted with
VectashieldHardSet mounting medium with DAPI Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Pictures were captured by
ﬂuorescent microscope.
