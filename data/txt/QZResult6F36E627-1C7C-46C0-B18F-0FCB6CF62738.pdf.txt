BACKGROUND. Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam (Sm-153) is an effective and welltolerated treatment for painful bone metastases. The purpose of the analysis was
to assess the safety and efficacy of repeated doses of Sm-153 in patients with
metastatic bone pain.

METHODS. Data were collected prospectively for 202 patients administered
1.0 mCi/kg of Sm-153. Particular emphasis was placed on analysis of data from

CONCLUSIONS. Repeated dosing of 1.0 mCi/kg of Sm-153 was both safe and effective and is a reasonable treatment option in patients whose bone pain responds
and then recurs after an initial dose provided that adequate hematologic function
is present at the time of drug administration. Cancer 2007;109:637–43.

etastases to bone frequently develop in patients with a variety
of primary cancers. The high prevalence of bone metastases in
prostate and breast cancers in particular arises as a result of a combination of the high incidence of spread to bone and the relatively
protracted clinical course of the advanced state of these cancers.
Furthermore, it is not uncommon that the bulk of the tumor burden
at the time of death in patients diagnosed with these primary cancers will be in bone.1 Bone metastases are a source of considerable
morbidity, including pain, hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression,
pathologic fracture, and marrow infiltration with associated hematologic consequences. Bone pain caused by metastases may initially
be mild to moderate in severity; however, as the disease progresses

bone pain often increases in intensity, becomes multifocal in nature, and refractory to the various
treatments available. In a review of the skeletal complications of malignancy, Coleman1 states that: ‘‘Well
tolerated, repeatable, effective treatments for bone
pain are necessary to try to optimize the quality of
life for cancer patients.’’ A comprehensive review of
the management options available for bone metastases has previously been published.2 For patients with
multiple symptomatic bone metastases recurring
after an initial course of hormonal or chemotherapy,
bone-targeted systemic radionuclides have emerged
as a viable treatment option. These agents are also
useful in patients previously treated to their maximal
normal tissue tolerance with focal external beam
radiation who subsequently have progressive or recurrent symptoms at those previously irradiated sites.3
The bone-targeted therapeutic radiopharmaceutical samarium Sm 153 lexidronam (Sm-153) (Quadramet, Cytogen, Princeton, NJ) has been shown to be
an effective and well-tolerated treatment for painful
bone metastases in 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.4,5 Patients administered the approved 1.0 mCi/kg dose in these
studies experienced both reductions in pain (as
scored on daily visual analog pain scale assessments)
as well as reductions in opioid analgesic use. Onset
of pain relief was generally observed within the first
week after injection and persisted for a median of at
least 16 weeks in patients responding to treatment.
In these and other large studies carried out in Europe
and Asia, including one conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the only clinically significant toxicity reported was mild and transient
myelosuppression.6–8 Beginning 1 to 2 weeks after
injection, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT)
counts fall to a nadir of approximately 50% of the
baseline at 3 to 5 weeks after administration. Counts
generally recover to baseline levels by 8 weeks. Nonhematologic adverse events occurred at similar rates
for patients administered active treatment as in those
receiving placebo.4,5
Because of their design and endpoints, these studies did not permit patients to receive more than a
single administration of Sm-153. A single small study
has been reported in which patients were treated
with multiple (up to 4) doses; however, almost half
(9/19) of the patients received a dose of 0.5 mCi/kg
(half the approved dose) and repeat dosing in all
patients was based on recovery from hematologic
toxicity, not recurrence of symptoms.9 None of these
studies addressed the common clinical scenario of
patients who initially respond and subsequently
are candidates for additional treatments. We herein

report a series of patients receiving 1.0 mCi/kg
administrations of Sm-153 for palliation of pain who
were permitted to receive additional administrations
upon the recurrence of painful symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This was a multicenter, open-label, study of patients
given 1.0 mCi/kg intravenous (i.v.) injections of Sm153 for palliation of bone pain secondary to metastases to bone. The study was opened at 22 centers in
the US, Canada, and Europe to permit patients with
painful bone metastases to receive retreatment on a
compassionate use basis.
Major eligibility criteria included: histologically
confirmed carcinoma with painful bone metastases
positive on radionuclide bone scan; recurrence after
a response to antineoplastic therapy (hormonal,
chemotherapeutic, or a combination thereof ), a Karnofsky performance status 50;, and a signed institutional review board-approved informed consent
form before the initiation of any study-related procedures. Exclusion criteria included no prior antineoplastic therapy; a life expectancy of <2 months;
palliative radiation therapy within 6 weeks or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of dosing; WBC <4000/mm3;
PLT <100,000/mm3; serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL;
serum bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL.
Patients were eligible for retreatment with Sm153 if pain improved by Week 4 after initial treatment but subsequently recurred by Week 8 or later
(provided adequate hematologic function was present). Patients were not eligible for repeated Sm-153
infusion if no improvement in bone pain was noted
after initial administration. Baseline characteristics of
patients enrolled in the study are summarized in
Table 1. Breast and prostate cancer patients comprised the vast majority of the cohort.
Study Procedures
Baseline evaluations included complete history, physical examination, laboratory studies, Karnofsky performance status, and a Tc-99m bone scan.
Pain was assessed at baseline and again at Weeks
4 and 8 using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI),10 a validated numeric pain rating scale that has previously
been widely used to measure pain in outpatients
with metastatic cancer.11 In addition to assessing
pain intensity (worst, least, average, and immediate),
the BPI includes questions on degree of relief provided by pain treatments or medications and on how
pain has interfered with several components of normal daily activities. It does not assess analgesic con-

sumption. Patients assessed their average pain on a
horizontal row of equidistant numbers from 0 (‘‘no
pain’’) to 10 (‘‘pain as bad as you can imagine’’).
Missing BPI data, a consequence of either study discontinuation or noncompliance, were not imputed.
Patients continued systemic medications, such as
analgesics for symptom relief, as needed, but were
encouraged to reduce the use of these medications
to the extent possible after study treatment. Patients
were not allowed to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy during study participation.
After each administration of Sm-153, patients
were evaluated for 8 weeks with repeated laboratory
measurements. Each 8-week period began with its
own baseline and laboratory assessments performed
at each baseline included complete blood cell counts
(CBC), urinalysis, and serum biochemistry (glucose,
blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, creatinine, total protein, albumin, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase,
lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, phosphorus, and serum electrolytes). A CBC was obtained on Day 0 and
at Weeks 2–6 and 8 after administration. Urinalysis

639

and serum biochemistry were repeated at Weeks 4
and 8. All adverse events during the study period
were recorded regardless of severity or attribution.
Etiology of adverse events was assigned by the treating physician.
Nadir values for WBCs and PLTs were evaluated
for patients with hematology results for 21 days after administration. Myelotoxicity grade was based on
nadirs in WBCs and PLTs, and defined according to
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.
A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed to assess differences in PLT nadirs
among the dose groups.

Analysis of Pain Scores
Two groups of patients were analyzed. The first consisted of those who received at least 2 doses of Sm153 (n ¼ 55). The second group consisted of those
who received at least 3 doses of Sm-153 (n ¼ 11). For
each group the average pain intensity score at baseline (from the BPI) and the change from baseline
to Weeks 4 and 8 were analyzed. The analysis of
baseline was performed using a repeated-measures
ANOVA using PROC MIXED in SAS (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). The model included the factors of patient
and dose number. The analysis of the change from
baseline was also performed using a repeated-measures ANOVA using PROC MIXED in SAS. The model
included the factors of patient, dose number, timepoint, and dose number by timepoint interaction.

RESULTS
Demographics
The demographics and treatment history for patients
who received more than 1 administration were not
substantially different from that of all patients enrolled in the study (see Table 1). The majority of
patients were male; the predominant underlying malignancy was prostate cancer; the second most common malignancy was breast cancer. Most patients
had 10 lesions visible on bone scan and most had
previously received 1 or more courses of external
beam radiotherapy (see below). Baseline levels of hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, WBCs, and PLTs for
patients who eventually received more than 1 administration were not significantly different compared
with all patients enrolled in the study.
Of the entire cohort of 202 patients, 154 (76%)
had received prior external beam radiation therapy:
23 received radiation solely for treatment of their primary disease, 49 received radiation both for treatment of their primary disease and for treatment of
bone metastases, and 82 received radiation solely for

Safety
Hematologic toxicity
The only clinically significant toxicity associated with
the administration of Sm-153 was transient myelosuppression. Both WBCs and PLTs decreased to a nadir value of approximately half of baseline at 4 weeks
postinjection. Absolute nadir and nadir as a percentage of baseline for both WBCs and PLTs after the
first dose of Sm-153 did not differ substantially for
patients who eventually received repeated doses
from that observed for patients who only received a
single administration (Table 2). There were no effects
on hemoglobin levels after either initial or repeated
administrations of Sm-153 (Fig. 1).
For patients receiving multiple doses, time to nadir did not change for either WBCs or PLTs from that
seen after the first dose. The nadir level of PLTs after
a second administration did not differ significantly
from that observed after the first; however, the PLT
nadir after a third administration was lower (P < .05)
than that after either the first or second (see Table 2).
The incidence of grade 3 WBC toxicity after
an initial dose of Sm-153 was very similar for those
who eventually received multiple administrations
(Table 3). The incidence of grade 3 WBC toxicity after

repeat administrations (2%–4%) was marginally lower
than that after an initial administration. There were
no occurrences of grade 4 WBC toxicity after any
administration.
There were no occurrences of grade 3 PLT toxicity after an initial dose of Sm-153 in patients who
eventually received multiple administrations as compared with a rate of 11% observed after all initial
administrations. The incidence of grade 3 PLT toxicity in patients who received only 1 administration
(20/188, 11%) was similar to that observed after Dose
2 (12%) and Doses 3 (17%) for patients who
received multiple administrations. There was a single
occurrence of grade 4 platelet toxicity that occurred
after an initial dose. Recovery to PLT >75,000/mm3
and WBC >3,000/mm3 (toxicity grade 1 or less) by
Week 8 occurred in 89.9% (160/178) of patients after
an initial administration and 90.4% (66/73) after a
second or greater administration.
Two patients were hospitalized for hematuria in
association with thrombocytopenia, 1 after a second
administration and the other after a fourth administration. Etiology was not determined but both

patients recovered without sequelae. Another patient
developed disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) and died shortly thereafter. DIC is a known
complication of advanced prostate cancer and the
DIC in this patient was attributed to the underlying
disease by the treating physician. This patient did
not die from progressive thrombocytopenia but
rather from progressive prostate cancer. There were
no other serious infectious or hemorrhagic adverse
events associated with treatment.

Nonhematologic Adverse Events
Nonhematologic adverse events were usually related
to the patient’s underlying disease or to use of
concomitant medications, particularly opioids. In
general, the frequency of these events after repeat
administrations was similar to or less than that observed after the first. Bone pain flare reactions were
reported in 5 patients (2.5%), all after an initial
administration.
Only 1 patient was withdrawn from the study
secondary to an adverse event. This patient was
admitted to the hospital because of cervical dislocation at C1/C2 that required internal fixation. The
event was not thought to be treatment related and
the patient recovered without sequelae.
Overall, 20 patients died during or within 30 days
after completion of their participation in the study.
Eighteen deaths occurred after a first administration
and 2 after a second administration. None were
judged to be treatment related by the treating physicians.
Efficacy
Pain scores
Mean pain scores after initial, second, and third
administrations of Sm-153 are shown in Figure 2.
Differences in baseline pain scores across doses were
not significant. For patients receiving 2 administrations of Sm-153, decreases from baseline in pain
scores were significant at Week 4 (P < .0001) and
Week 8 (P < .003), after both doses. After a third dose
of Sm-153, decreases from baseline were significant
at Week 4 (P < .001) but not at Week 8. Dose group
comparisons for changes from baseline in pain
scores were not significant (P > .05). Dose group by
timepoint interactions were likewise not significant
(P > .05).
On an individual patient basis, at Week 4 pain
scores decreased from baseline in 70%, 63%, and
80% of patients after Doses 1, 2, and 3, respectively,
with decreases of at least 2 units observed in 56%,
49%, and 50% of patients.

DISCUSSION
Despite a favorable safety and efficacy profile that
has been demonstrated in a number of clinical settings, routine use of bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for the palliation of disseminated painful bone
metastases has generally been reserved for very latestage patients in whom other treatment options have
been exhausted.12 In part, this practice pattern
may have evolved as a result of the variable and
potentially protracted myelosuppression sometimes
associated with early generation agents such as
phosphorous-32 (32P) and strontium-89 (89Sr). Nuclear decay properties such as half-life and particle
energy influence clinical characteristics of these
agents including onset and duration of effect and
degree of and time to recovery from myelosuppression. Particle emissions from 32P and 89Sr are significantly higher in energy compared with 153Sm.
Higher-energy particles are associated with larger
volumes of marrow exposed to radiation.13 The
shorter physical half-life of 153Sm (1.9 days) also
results in shorter exposure to radioactivity as compared with either 32P (14.3 days) or 89Sr (50.5 days).
The time required to deliver 90% of the total dose of
radiation (approximately 3.5 half-lives) is approximately 1 week for 153Sm, 7 weeks for 32P, and
25 weeks for 89Sr.
This report contains an evaluation of the safety
and efficacy of repeated dosing of Sm-153 for the
treatment of bone pain in the largest population
reported to date. The patients typically had advanced
cancers (>90% had prostate or breast cancer),
numerous previous treatments, and extensive multifocal bone involvement. Patients who eventually
received repeated doses, as compared with those
who received only a single dose, were very similar in
baseline characteristics, treatment history, and extent
of myelosuppression observed after the first dose.
Myelosuppression was mild and transient in the

repeat dosing group, consistent with previous reports
derived from the single-dose literature.4–8 PLT and
WBC nadirs occurred at approximately 4 weeks postdose independent of the number of doses administered, with recovery by approximately 8 weeks
postdose. As in prior single-dose studies, there were
no treatment-related effects on hemoglobin levels after repeated administration. For PLTs, the absolute
level of the nadir decreased somewhat with an
increasing number of doses; however, the nadir as a
percentage of baseline did not. For WBCs, the absolute level of the nadir was relatively constant; however, the nadir as a percentage of baseline increased
with subsequent administrations. These findings suggest that WBCs and PLTs did not fully recover to the
baseline levels present before treatment. Similar
results were reported for PLTs in a previous preliminary analysis of single and repeat administration.14
Because the present study did not involve a control
group, it is not possible to clearly attribute these
effects on WBCs and PLTs to either cumulative radiation of bone marrow or from progressive cancerous
disease in marrow (or from some combination of
these and other potential causes). It is worth noting
that a similar pattern of decreasing PLTs over a 16week period was noted in controlled trials enrolling
similar patients despite administration of only placebo.4,5 Whatever the mechanism of this effect, these
data would seem to indicate that the transient
decreases in baseline levels of WBCs and PLTs did
not predispose patients to more clinically significant
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia upon repeat
administration (ie, grade 3–4) provided that adequate
hematologic function was present before dosing. The
only incidence of grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred after a first dose and there were no instances
of grade 4 leukopenia after any administration.
In prior placebo-controlled studies, bone marrow
suppression was the only adverse event associated
with the use of Sm-153.4,5 The most common nonhematologic adverse events observed in the current
study were similar in nature and frequency to those
in both the active treatment and control groups of
prior placebo-controlled studies, and did not increase in frequency upon repeat dosing. The percentage of patients who died after an initial (8.9%) or
second (3.6%) dose were likewise not substantially
different from those for the placebo (3/39, 7.7%) and
active treatment (7/79, 8.9%) groups of prior placebocontrolled studies.
Interpretation of efficacy results from this study
must take into account the limitations of lack of a
control group and blinding of the investigators and
patients to treatment.15 Baseline pain scores in the

current study were very close to those reported in
prior placebo-controlled studies. Consistent, statistically significant decreases were observed at Week 4
(the prospective primary endpoint in the placebo
controlled studies) after each of the first 3 doses of
Sm-153. The magnitude of these changes were likewise similar to those observed in placebo-controlled
studies. The percentage of patients reporting a
decrease in pain scores (63%–80%) was similar to the
percentage reported as responders in prior placebo4,5
(65%–72%) and dose6 (70%) controlled studies. Thus,
it appears that the pain response after multiple
administrations of Sm-153 is similar to that after an
initial administration both in terms of decrease in
pain intensity scores and percentage of patients
responding.
The current study demonstrates that treatment
of bone pain with Sm-153 may be repeated without
significantly increasing toxicity, provided that adequate PLT and WBC counts are present at baseline.
Nadir levels of both WBCs and PLTs were approximately 50% of baseline regardless of whether prior
administration(s) had been given. Pain responses after multiple administrations were similar to that after
an initial administration both in terms of decrease
in pain intensity scores and percentage of patients
responding.

Conclusions
Repeated dosing of Sm-153 for the treatment of bone
pain resulting from skeletal metastases is both efficacious and well-tolerated and may be considered a
reasonable treatment option in patients whose bone
pain recurs after an initial dose provided that baseline hematologic criteria are adequate for administration. Neither the frequency nor the severity of
adverse events increased with repeated dosing of
Sm-153 in this cohort of patients. Pain responses
after repeated dosing are similar in magnitude and
frequency to those observed after an initial dose.
