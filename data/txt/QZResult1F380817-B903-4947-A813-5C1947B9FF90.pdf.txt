Abstract
To develop novel mechanism-based preventive approaches for
lung cancer, we examined the effect of oral consumption of a
human achievable dose of pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) on
growth, progression, angiogenesis, and signaling pathways in
two mouse lung tumor protocols. Benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] and
N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea (NTCU) were used to induce
lung tumors, and PFE was given in drinking water to A/J mice.
Lung tumor yield was examined on the 84th day and 140 days
after B(a)P dosing and 240 days after NTCU treatment. Mice
treated with PFE and exposed to B(a)P and NTCU had
statistically significant lower lung tumor multiplicities than
mice treated with carcinogens only. Tumor reduction was
53.9% and 61.6% in the B(a)P + PFE group at 84 and 140 days,
respectively, compared with the B(a)P group. The NTCU + PFE
group had 65.9% tumor reduction compared with the NTCU
group at 240 days. Immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to determine effect on cell survival pathways and markers of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.
PFE treatment caused inhibition of (a) activation of nuclear
factor-KB and IKBA kinase, (b) degradation and phosphorylation of IKBA, (c) phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2,
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2, and p38), (d) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 and p110), (e) phosphorylation of Akt
at Thr308, ( f ) activation of mammalian target of rapamycin
signaling, (g ) phosphorylation of c-met, and (h) markers of
cell proliferation (Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen)
and angiogenesis (inducible nitric oxide synthase, CD31, and
vascular endothelial growth factor) in lungs of B(a)P- and
NTCU-treated mice. Thus, our data show that PFE significantly
inhibits lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice and merits investigation as a chemopreventive agent for human lung cancer.

Introduction
Lung cancer has increased in prevalence at alarming rates since
the last decade, particularly because of the augmented trend in
smoking, so that it is now the most common cause of cancer death
in the world, representing 28% of all cancer deaths. This cancer has
proven difficult to control with conventional therapeutic and
surgical approaches, and the prognosis is poor with an overall
5-year survival rate of 10% to 14% in the United States (1). The fact
that lung cancer is a conglomerate of diseases that elicit symptoms

at a relatively late stage is considered to be the main reason for this
lack of progress. Thus, in most cases, the initial diagnosis is made
when the disease has significantly advanced and is beyond the
stage of current treatment options. The use of naturally occurring
or synthetic agents to prevent, inhibit, or reverse lung carcinogenesis would therefore greatly benefit public health.
The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruit has been used for
centuries in ancient cultures for its medicinal purposes. For a long
time, pomegranate fruit is widely consumed fresh and more
recently in beverage form as juice. Pomegranate juice has been
shown to suppress inflammatory cell signaling proteins in the
HT-29 human colon cancer cells (2). In a murine mammary gland
organ culture, fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols caused
inhibition of chemically induced cancerous lesion formation (3).
Pomegranate juice possesses potent antioxidant activity that
results in marked protection of nitric oxide (NO) against oxidative
destruction, thereby resulting in augmentation of the biological
actions of NO (4). Pomegranate juice was also found to cause the
up-regulation of the expression of endothelial NO synthase, which
was down-regulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein in human
coronary endothelial cells (5). We extracted edible seeds of
pomegranate fruit with acetone, hereafter referred to as pomegranate fruit extract (PFE). Based on matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF MS) analysis, PFE was found to contain anthocyanins (such as
delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonidin) and several hydrolyzable
tannins (such as punicalin, pedunculagin, punicalagin, gallagic, and
ellagic acid esters of glucose), which account for 92% of the
antioxidant activity of the whole fruit (6). We have shown that PFE
possesses remarkable antitumor-promoting effects in mouse skin
(7) and antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in prostate cancer
(8). PFE was also found to protect against the adverse effects of
UVB and UVA radiation by inhibiting cellular pathways in normal
human epidermal keratinocytes (9, 10). We have recently reported
that PFE inhibits prosurvival signaling pathways in human lung
carcinoma A549 cells and inhibits tumor growth in athymic nude
mice (11). Recently, the first clinical trial to determine the effects of
pomegranate juice consumption on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
progression in men with rising PSA level following primary therapy
was reported. Mean PSA doubling time significantly increased on
treatment with pomegranate juice in men, and there was decrease
in cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells (12).
We hypothesized that PFE may be a useful chemopreventive agent
for lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we tested the effect of oral
consumption of PFE against mouse models of lung tumorigenesis.
We further defined the mechanistic basis of the observed chemopreventive effects. We found that PFE treatment to A/J mice exposed
to benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] and N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea
(NTCU) resulted in significant inhibition of lung tumor incidence
and tumor multiplicity and inhibition of mitogen-activated protein

kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, c-met, mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling, markers of cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis. These data provide molecular insight into the chemopreventive effects of PFE against lung cancer by blocking
signaling pathways, which are prerequisite for the development
and progression of lung tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (phosphorylated p44/42Thr202/Tyr204), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2 (phosphorylated p54/46Thr183/Tyr185), p38 (phosphorylated p38Thr180/Tyr204), InBa,
phosphorylated InBa, mTOR (phosphorylated mTORSer2448), eukaryotic
initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1; phosphorylated
4EBP1Ser65), eIF4E (phosphorylated eIF4ESer209), 40S ribosomal protein S6
kinase (p70S6K; phosphorylated p70S6K), and AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) a (phosphorylated AMPKaThr172) antibodies were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies (IKKa), Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), CD31,
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). NF-nB/p65, Akt (phosphorylated
AktThr308), PI3K (p85 and p110), c-met (phosphorylated c-metTyr1234/Tyr1235),
and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) were procured from Upstate (Lake
Placid, NY). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibody horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was from Amersham Life Science, Inc.
(Arlington Heights, IL). LightShift chemiluminescent bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Novex
precast Tris-glycine gels were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Preparation of PFE. As described recently, fresh fruit of pomegranate
was peeled and its edible portion (seed coat and juice) was squeezed in 70%
acetone-30% distilled water (1:20, w/v). The red extract was filtered through
filter paper (Whatman no.1). The filtrate was condensed and freeze dried.
The freeze-dried extract was stored at 4jC. In our recent publication, we
have analyzed PFE using a novel technique of MALDI-TOF MS. The PFE
preparation used in this study was found to contain six anthocyanins
(pelargonidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, delphinidin 3-glucoside,
pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside, and delphinidin
3,5-diglucoside) and various ellagitannins and hydrolyzable tannins (7).
Animals. Female strain A/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor,
ME) of 7 weeks of age were used in both tumor bioassays. Throughout the
experimental protocol, the mice were maintained at standard conditions
under 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed AIN-76A diet and water ad libitum.
B(a)P tumor study. B(a)P is one of the most ubiquitous environmental
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons known to be present in automobile
exhaust and cigarette smoke, and it induces lung tumors in mice (13). Fortyeight A/J mice at 7 weeks of age were randomly distributed into four groups
containing 12 mice in each group. The mice in group 1 received normal
drinking water and were given the vehicle only (cottonseed oil) and served
as control. The animals of groups 2 and 4 received the same drinking water
supplemented with 0.2% PFE (w/v) until the termination of the experiment
at day 140. The water bottles were changed every other day. The dose of PFE
(0.2% PFE, w/v) selected for feeding mice is based on the assumption that a
typical healthy individual (70 kg) may be persuaded to drink 500 mL of
pomegranate juice extracted from two fruits. One week after treatment with
PFE, mice in groups 3 and 4 were gavaged with a single dose of 20 Amol
B(a)P in 0.2 mL of cottonseed oil (Fig. 1A). At 84th day after B(a)P
treatment, six mice from each group were sacrificed to quantify lung
adenomas, and the lobes of lungs were placed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formalin for immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. At 140th day
after B(a)P treatment, the remaining mice were sacrificed and the number
of lung adenomas was recorded. We observed that no mice died
prematurely or had to be sacrificed ahead of the proposed termination time.
NTCU tumor study. Although there are several established models for
lung adenoma and adenocarcinomas, there is no well-established mouse
model for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). NTCU was used previously

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

to induce preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, including lung SCC (14).
Forty-eight A/J mice were randomly distributed into four groups containing
12 mice in each group. Forty-eight hours before initial treatment, the dorsal
skin of the mice was shaved. Mice in group 1 received normal drinking
water and treated with 25 AL acetone, which is the solvent used for NTCU
and served as control. Mice in groups 2 and 4 received the same drinking
water supplemented with 0.2% PFE (w/v) until the termination of the
experiment, and the water bottles were changed every other day. One week
after treatment with PFE, mice in groups 3 and 4 were treated topically with
25 AL of 4 mmol/L NTCU (in acetone), twice weekly, with a 3-day interval
(Fig. 1C). The animals were sacrificed 240 days after the initial treatment
with NTCU. Other details were exactly the same as that described for B(a)P
tumor study.
Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear lysates. The lung tissue samples
were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L NaF, 100 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 0.5% NP40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), pH 7.4] with freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail
(Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The
homogenate was then centrifuged at 14,000  g for 25 min at 4jC, and
the supernatant (whole-cell lysate) was collected, aliquoted, and stored at
80jC. For the preparation of cytosolic and nuclear lysates, the lung tissue
samples were incubated in 0.4 mL ice-cold lysis buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.9), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 1 mmol/L PMSF] with freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail for
15 min, after which 12.5 AL of 10% NP40 were added and the contents were
mixed on a vortex and then centrifuged for 1 min (14,000  g ) at 4jC. The
supernatant was saved as cytosolic lysate and stored at 80jC. The nuclear
pellet was resuspended in 50 AL of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer
[20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L PMSF] with freshly added protease
inhibitor cocktail for 30 min with intermittent mixing. The tubes were
centrifuged for 5 min (14,000  g ) at 4jC, and the supernatant (nuclear
extract) was stored at 80jC. The protein concentration was determined by
the BCA protein assay kit.
Western blot analysis. For immunoblotting, 30 to 50 Ag of protein were
resolved over 8% to 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked in blocking buffer [5%
nonfat dry milk/1% Tween 20 in 20 mmol/L TBS (pH 7.6)] for 1 h at room
temperature, incubated with appropriate monoclonal or polyclonal primary
antibody in blocking buffer for 1.5 h to overnight at 4jC followed by
incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody HRP
conjugate, and detected by chemiluminescence and autoradiography using
XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY).
Immunohistochemical analysis. Sections (5 Am thick) were cut from
paraffin-embedded lung tissues. Immunostaining was done using specific
antibodies with appropriate dilutions and replaced with either normal host
serum or block for negative controls followed by staining with appropriate
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The slides were developed in
diaminobenzidine and counterstained with a weak solution of hematoxylin
stain. The stained slides were dehydrated and mounted in permount and
visualized on a Zeiss-Axiophot DM HT microscope (Zeiss-Axiophot, Jena,
Germany). Images were captured with an attached camera linked to a
computer.
Statistical analysis. Tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity data are
summarized using descriptive statistics, such as proportion and mean along
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), respectively. The observed
differences in the tumor multiplicity, Ki-67, PCNA, CD31, iNOS, and VEGF
data were tested for statistical significance using Student’s t test. All
statistical tests were two sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analysis was done and graphs were produced using
the R language.3

Results
Inhibitory effect of PFE on lung tumor multiplicity in A/J
mice. In the first experiment, we determined the effect of oral
consumption of PFE on B(a)P-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J
mice (Fig. 1A). In B(a)P tumor study at interim sacrifice on the 84th
day after B(a)P treatment, mice treated with B(a)P and given PFE
(0.2% in drinking water) had statistically significant lower lung
tumor multiplicities (i.e., mean number of tumors/mouse) than
B(a)P-treated mice [7.7 tumors/mouse in the B(a)P group versus
3.5 tumors/mouse in the B(a)P + PFE group; difference, 4.2 tumors/
mouse; 95% CI, 2.6 to 11.0 tumors/mouse; P = 0.2], corresponding
to a 53.9% of tumor reduction (Fig. 1B, left). At 140 days after B(a)P
treatment, there was 61.6% of tumor reduction in mice treated with
B(a)P and given PFE [13.3 tumors/mouse in the B(a)P group versus
5.2 tumors/mouse in the B(a)P + PFE group; difference, 8.1 tumors/
mouse; 95% CI, 5–11.4 tumors/mouse; P < 0.001; Fig. 1B, right].
Mice in groups 1 (control) and 2 (PFE treated) did not develop any
tumors at any of the time point.
We next determined the effect of oral consumption of PFE on
second bioassay of lung tumorigenesis induced by NTCU in A/J
mice (Fig. 1C). At 240 days after NTCU treatment, NTCU-treated
mice given PFE had statistically significant lower lung tumor

www.aacrjournals.org

multiplicities than mice treated with NTCU (17.7 tumors/mouse in
the NTCU group versus 6.1 tumors/mouse in the NTCU + PFE
group; difference, 11.6 tumors/mouse; 95% CI, 8.9–14.3 tumors/
mouse; P < 0.001), corresponding to a 65.9% of tumor reduction
(Fig. 1D). No tumors in groups 1 (control) and 2 (PFE treated)
throughout the study were observed. There was no significant
difference in the body weight of mice in all treatment groups in
both the bioassays.
Inhibitory effect of PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
activation of NF-nB and IKKa and phosphorylation and
degradation of InBa in A/J mice. NF-nB is a ubiquitous nuclear
transcription factor that plays a major regulatory role in
carcinogenesis. It resides in the inactive state in the cytoplasm as
a heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and InBa subunits. IKK has
been identified that phosphorylates serine residues in InBa. The
phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of InBa results in
activation and nuclear translocation of NF-nB. To examine whether
the inhibitory effect of PFE on lung tumor formation observed in
the study is due to restoration of InBa, we determined the
cytoplasmic level of InBa protein expression by immunoblot
analysis. We observed that B(a)P and NTCU treatment resulted in
the degradation of InBa protein expression in lungs of A/J mice,
whereas oral consumption of PFE resulted in restoration of B(a)Pand NTCU-induced degradation of InBa protein (Fig. 2A and B).

Figure 2. Effect of oral consumption of
PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
phosphorylation and degradation of InBa
and activation of NF-nB and IKKa in lungs
of A/J mice. As detailed in Materials and
Methods, cytosolic and nuclear lysates of
all groups were prepared from lung tissue
samples from B(a )P (A) and NTCU (B)
tumor studies and protein was subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot
analysis and chemiluminescence
detection. Equal loading of protein was
confirmed by stripping the immunoblot and
reprobing it for h-actin. For nuclear fraction,
equal loading of the protein was confirmed
by reprobing it for lamin. Immunoblot
analysis was conducted in all animals of
each group, and only representative blots
of two animals from each group are shown.

PFE-treated groups were found to inhibit B(a)P- and NTCUinduced phosphorylation of InBa protein at Ser32 (Fig. 2A and B).
We also found that B(a)P and NTCU treatment caused the
activation of IKKa protein that in turn phosphorylates and
degrades the InBa protein, resulting in the activation and nuclear
translocation of p65, the functionally active subunit of NF-nB. PFE
consumption caused inhibition of B(a)P- and NTCU-induced
activation of IKKa and NF-nB/p65 (Fig. 2A and B).
Inhibitory effect of PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
phosphorylation of MAPKs in A/J mice. Because the activation
of MAPKs is implicated in stress-induced cell death and the
regulation of NF-nB activation, we next investigated whether the
phosphorylation of MAPKs was altered by the treatment of PFE
in the lungs of A/J mice. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2,
and p38 proteins in the whole-cell lysates was determined by
immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A and B). We found that B(a)P and
NTCU treatment resulted in marked expression of the phosphor-

ylated forms of ERK1/2 (p44 and p42), JNK1/2 (p54 and p46), and
p38 proteins. However, PFE (0.2% in drinking water) treatment was
found to result in significant inhibition in the phosphorylated
forms of all MAPK proteins (Fig. 3A and B).
Inhibitory effect of PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
activation of PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt in A/J mice. The
PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in various cellular
processes, including cell growth, survival, and motility. We
therefore determined the effect of PFE on PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt protein expression in A/J mice. Immunoblot analysis
revealed that B(a)P and NTCU treatment caused a significant
increase in the expression of both p85 as well as p110 subunits of
PI3K and increased phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308. PFE
treatment was found to result in a significant inhibition of B(a)Pand NTCU-induced increased expression of both catalytic and
regulatory subunits of PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3C
and D).

prepared from lung tissue samples from
B(a)P (A and C ) and NTCU (B and D )
tumor studies and protein was subjected

detection. Equal loading of protein was
confirmed by stripping the immunoblot and

Inhibition of Lung Tumorigenesis by Pomegranate

Inhibitory effect of PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
activation of mTOR signaling and phosphorylation of c-met in
A/J mice. The well-documented evidence indicating that mTOR is
downstream of both PI3K and Akt led us to determine whether
phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 was a result of PI3K/Akt
activation. Treatment with B(a)P and NTCU caused increased
phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448, whereas PFE administration
resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of mTOR (Fig. 4A and B).
The mTOR integrates mitogenic signals and intracellular nutrient
levels to activate 4EBP1 and p70S6K, which controls protein
translation and cell cycle progression. Because mTOR activation
stimulates the phosphorylation of downstream kinases, we next
examined the effect of PFE on p70S6K, eIF4E, and 4EBP1
expression. B(a)P and NTCU treatment resulted in increased
phosphorylation of p70S6K, eIF4E, and 4EBP1 proteins. However,
PFE-treated groups showed decreased phosphorylation of the
downstream targets of mTOR (Fig. 4A and B). AMPKa is the
upstream down-regulator of mTOR. In the activated state, AMPKa
down-regulates several anabolic enzymes and thus shuts down the
ATP-consuming metabolic pathways. We therefore investigated the
effect of PFE on connection between AMPKa and mTOR signaling.
B(a)P and NTCU treatment to mice caused decreased phosphorylation of AMPKa, whereas treatment with PFE activated AMPKa
as shown by the increased phosphorylation of AMPKa protein
expression (Fig. 4A and B).
The c-met receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand hepatocyte
growth factor are involved in angiogenesis, cellular motility,
growth, invasion, and differentiation. The expression of c-met has
been widely investigated in several solid tumors of head and neck,
esophagus, breast, kidney, and prostate. In this study, we also found
that phosphorylated form of c-met was detectable with unique
preferential expression in the B(a)P- and NTCU-treated lung tissues
and there was decreased phosphorylation of c-met in the lung
tissues of mice that received PFE (Fig. 4A and B).
Inhibitory effect of PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
activation of cell proliferation markers in A/J mice. Many
chemopreventive trials have used various markers known to be
causally linked to lung cancer as surrogate end point biomarkers,
including the assessment of cell proliferation markers, such as
Ki-67 and PCNA. Ki-67 is expressed in all phases of the cell cycle,
except in resting cells. Because abnormal epithelial proliferation is
a hallmark of tumorigenesis, the measurement of Ki-67 and PCNA
in lung tissues as a surrogate end point biomarker for lung cancer

chemoprevention trials has attracted significant interest. There was
marked decrease in the number of Ki-67–positive and PCNApositive cells in the lungs of mice given PFE compared with B(a)Pand NTCU-treated mice (Fig. 5A and B). The percentage of Ki-67–
positive cells was 48.3% lower in the lungs of B(a)P-treated mice
that also received PFE compared with only B(a)P–treated mice and
53.3% lower in the lungs of NTCU-treated mice that received PFE
compared with only NTCU–treated mice. The mean percentages of
Ki-67–positive cells were 31.1 in the B(a)P-only group, 16.1 in the
B(a)P + PFE group (difference, 15.0; 95% CI, 10.5–19.7; P < 0.001),
28.2 in the NTCU-only group, and 13.1 in the NTCU + PFE group
(difference, 15.1; 95% CI, 13.4–16.7; P < 0.001; Fig. 5C, left).
Similarly, the percentage of PCNA-positive cells was 52.7% lower
in the lungs of B(a)P-treated mice that also received PFE compared
with only B(a)P–treated mice and 73.5% lower in the lungs of
NTCU-treated mice that received PFE compared with only NTCU–
treated mice. The mean percentages of PCNA-positive cells were
43.2 in the B(a)P-only group, 20.5 in the B(a)P + PFE group
(difference, 22.7; 95% CI, 19.3–26.2; P < 0.001), 58.5 in the NTCUonly group, and 15.5 in the NTCU + PFE group (difference, 43.0;
95% CI, 40.6–45.4; P < 0.001; Fig. 5C, right).
Inhibitory effect of PFE on B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated
activation of markers of angiogenesis in A/J mice. Angiogenesis
is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. It is strictly controlled
by a highly coordinated process that is regulated by many
molecules. Among them, iNOS, platelet-derived endothelial cell
adhesion molecule (CD31), and VEGF are most common markers
of tumor-associated angiogenesis. NO is a potentially genotoxic
reactive nitrogen species formed in vivo by NO synthases. Tumor
sections probed with an antibody to iNOS showed strong staining
in lungs of B(a)P- and NTCU-treated mice. The intensity and
degree of iNOS staining was markedly reduced in lung tissue
sections of PFE-treated groups (Fig. 6A). PFE decreased mean iNOS
immunoreactivity scores from 2.7 in the B(a)P-only group to 0.8 in
the B(a)P + PFE group (difference, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6–2.1; P < 0.001)
and from 3.2 in the NTCU-only group to 1.0 in the NTCU + PFE
group (difference, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.0–2.4; P < 0.001; Fig. 6D, left).
CD31 is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and
has an important role in many endothelial cell functions, including
angiogenesis, inflammation, integrin activation, and cell-cell
adhesion. By immunohistochemical analysis of the lung tissue
samples, we found large number of CD31-positive cells in B(a)Pand NTCU-treated mice and this was significantly lower in

Discussion
The lung cancer is increasing worldwide, and it is imperative
that the development of alternative approaches, such as chemoprevention, is needed to control this epidemic in addition to
continuing our efforts to strengthen the fundamental strategy
of avoiding exposure to carcinogens. Dietary interventions or
the use of chemopreventive agents can provide complementary
approaches for cancer prevention in lowering the risk in exsmokers and, possibly, in active smokers. Chemopreventive
strategies are required to control lung cancer as it is difficult to
treat with standard therapies. The continuing magnitude and
severity of the lung cancer problem make it desirable to enhance
smoking cessation campaigns and to make progress in early
detection and chemoprevention. New specific targets for prevention are being identified with the expanded understanding of the
molecular and biological mechanisms of lung cancer development.
The design of successful chemoprevention trials in the future
requires identification and validation of intermediate surrogate end
point biomarkers that are sufficiently predictive of lung cancer
development. Lessons from the treatment of advanced lung cancer
and the increased understanding of important cellular signaling
pathways point out that inhibiting these different regulatory
cascades might prevent and even reverse lung carcinogenesis. To
evaluate the effect of PFE against lung cancer in this study, we
induced lung tumors by B(a)P and NTCU in A/J mice. Treatment
with PFE resulted in decrease in tumor multiplicity in both B(a)Pand NTCU-treated mice. In B(a)P + PFE group, tumor reduction
was 53.9% and 61.6% at 84 and 140 days, respectively, compared
with B(a)P group and 65.9% in NTCU + PFE group compared with
NTCU group at 240 days (Fig. 1). These data have relevance in the
context of recently published study in which mean PSA doubling
time significantly increased on treatment with pomegranate juice
in men with a rising PSA following primary therapy (12). The
results of the study provide a basis for future evaluation of the
potential of PFE as chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent
against lung cancer.
NF-nB transcription factor has a central role in several cellular
processes, including proliferation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and regulation of the immune response (15). In
the present study, we found that oral administration of PFE to A/J
mice significantly inhibited B(a)P- and NTCU-induced NF-nB and
IKKa activation and phosphorylation and degradation of InBa
protein (Fig. 2). The MAPKs are regulated by distinct signal transduction pathways that control many aspects of mammalian cellular
physiology, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
In general, the ERK cascade is activated by growth factors and is
critical for cell proliferation. Conversely, the JNK and p38 pathways
are stimulated by genotoxic agents and cytokines mediating the
stress response, growth arrest, and apoptosis (16). The treatment
of A/J mice with PFE was found to significantly inhibit B(a)P- and
NTCU-induced phosphorylation of the MAPK proteins (Fig. 3).

The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell
growth and survival. Dysregulation of this pathway has been found
in a variety of cancer cells. Recently, constitutively active PI3K/Akt
signaling has been firmly established as a major determinant for
cell growth and survival in an array of cancers. Blocking the
constitutively active PI3K/Akt signaling pathway provides a new
strategy for targeted cancer therapy (17). Recently, it has been
reported that tobacco carcinogens induce Akt activation and lung
carcinogenesis in mice (18). Thus, inhibitors of this signaling
pathway would be potential anticancer agents because survival and
growth of cancer cells are dominated by constitutively active PI3K/
Akt signaling. PFE treatment to A/J mice resulted in the reduction
in B(a)P- and NTCU-mediated elevated expression of PI3K (p85
and p110) and phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 (Fig. 3).
The mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase, which belongs to family
of phosphatidylinositol kinase–related kinase family and is
involved in the regulation of a wide range of growth-related
cellular functions, including transcription, translation, membrane
trafficking, protein degradation, and reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton (19). The two best-characterized targets of mTOR in
mammals are the ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and
4EBP1. The activity of mTOR leads to S6K1/S6K2 phosphorylation
and activation and to 4EBP1 phosphorylation and release from the
cap-dependent translation initiation factor eIF4E. These two
events, likely combined with other mTOR targets, lead to an
increase in ribosomal biogenesis and the selective translation of
specific mRNA populations. This ability to increase the protein
synthesis capacity of the cell is responsible, at least in part, for the
ability of the mTOR proteins to drive cell growth and proliferation
and their implication in lung cancer progression (20). Overexpression of eIF4E leads to cell transformation or disordered
growth (21). It has been reported that activation of either PI3K or
Akt, both upstream of mTOR, is sufficient to induce the
phosphorylation of both 4EBP1 and p70S6K through mTOR (22),
which we have also noted in our B(a)P- and NTCU-treated samples.
There is also ample evidence that treatment of activated P13K- or
Akt-expressing cells with rapamycin blocks the phosphorylation of
p70S6K and 4EBP1, suggesting that mTOR is required for these
activities (23). PFE-treated mice showed decreased phosphorylation of mTOR protein expression and its downstream targets,
suggesting the effect of PFE on mTOR signaling (Fig. 4). AMPKa
activation strongly suppresses cell proliferation in nonmalignant
cells as well as in tumor cells. These actions of AMPKa seem to be
mediated through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of
the cell cycle and inhibition of protein synthesis. Several groups
have reported that activation of AMPKa suppresses mTOR
signaling by growth factors and amino acids (24). PFE supplementation resulted in the increased phosphorylation of the AMPKa
protein, whereas B(a)P and NTCU treatment resulted in its
decreased phosphorylation (Fig. 4). c-met is a receptor tyrosine
kinase, which stimulates the invasive growth of carcinoma cells. It
has been reported that c-met is overexpressed, activated, and
sometimes mutated in non–small cell lung cancer cell lines and
tumor tissues. It is an attractive potential target for novel
therapeutic inhibition in human cancers (25). We found that lungs
of B(a)P- and NTCU-treated mice showed increased phosphorylation of c-met and there was decreased phosphorylation in lungs of
mice treated with PFE (Fig. 4).
Ki-67 and PCNA are well-known markers of cellular proliferation. Moreover, Ki-67 expression has been reported to reflect the
level of tobacco-induced damage throughout the lung. These

characteristics suggest that Ki-67 may have added value, beyond
that of histopathology, in predicating lung tumor risk and as a
surrogate end point biomarker for chemopreventive efficacy.
PCNA is a cofactor of DNA polymerase and is required for DNA
replication and DNA nucleotide excision repair. The apparent
increase in PCNA immunostaining-positive cells is a general
feature of multistep carcinogenesis (26). We observed that there
was markedly less expression of Ki-67 and PCNA in lungs of mice
treated with PFE than in B(a)P- and NTCU-treated mice (Fig. 5).
iNOS is an enzyme responsible for the production of NO. It is now
widely accepted that iNOS is expressed in response to several
stresses, including inflammatory cytokines, bacterial endotoxin,
and cigarette smoking (27). The link between cigarette smoking
and the alteration of iNOS is particularly relevant to the
pathogenesis of lung cancer, as cigarette smoking is one of
primary risk factors that cause lung cancer. The expression of
iNOS was significantly increased in the B(a)P- and NTCU-treated
mice than in PFE-treated mice (Fig. 6). CD31 has been known to
be a reliable marker for endothelial differentiation. This is
important in revealing possible correlation of tumor angiogenesis
with metastatic behavior, prognosis, or angiogenic factor overexpression (28). PFE-treated groups displayed fewer CD31-stained
blood capillaries compared with B(a)P- and NTCU-treated groups,
which showed higher CD31-positive cells as visualized by brown
color staining (Fig. 6). VEGF is the major regulator of tumorassociated angiogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma, which can

promote tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibition of VEGF
reduces angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo (29). The present
study shows that VEGF was extensively expressed in the lungs of
B(a)P- and NTCU-treated mice and this expression was markedly
decreased in PFE-treated mice, suggesting that down-regulation of
VEGF is a possible mechanism by which PFE exerts its
antiangiogenic action (Fig. 6).
In conclusion, the results from this study clearly show that oral
consumption of PFE effectively inhibited lung tumor multiplicity
and incidence induced by B(a)P and NTCU. PFE treatment also
down-regulated the activation of (a) MAPKs, (b) NF-nB, (c) PI3K/
Akt, (d) mTOR signaling, and (e) c-met. PFE also caused reduced
expressions of markers of cell proliferation and angiogenesis in
lungs of B(a)P- and NTCU-treated mice. Furthermore, the present
study suggests that PFE inhibits lung tumorigenesis by targeting
multiple signaling pathways and associated events and, therefore,
strongly supports its development as chemopreventive agent
against human lung cancer.
