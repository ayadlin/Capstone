ABSTRACT:
Metabolic remodeling is a hallmark of cancer progression and may affect tumor
chemoresistance. Here we investigated by 1H-NMR/PCA analysis the metabolic
profile of chemoresistant breast cancer cell subpopulations (ALDHbright cells) and
their response to metformin, a promising anticancer metabolic modulator. The
purified ALDHbright cells exhibited a different metabolic profile as compared to their
chemosensitive ALDHlow counterparts. Metformin treatment strongly affected the
metabolism of the ALDHbright cells thereby affecting, among the others, the glutathione
metabolism, whose upregulation is a feature of progenitor-like, chemoresistant cell
subpopulations. Globally, metformin treatment reduced the differences between
ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells, making the former more similar to the latter. Metformin
broadly modulated microRNAs in the ALDHbright cells, with a large fraction of them
predicted to target the same metabolic pathways experimentally identified by 1H-NMR.
Additionally, metformin modulated the levels of c-MYC and IRS-2, and this correlated
with changes of the microRNA-33a levels. In summary, we observed, both by 1H-NMR
and microRNA expression studies, that metformin treatment reduced the differences
between the chemoresistant ALDHbright cells and the chemosensitive ALDHlow cells.
This works adds on the potential therapeutic relevance of metformin and shows the
potential for metabolic reprogramming to modulate cancer chemoresistance.

INTRODUCTION

more detailed data available regarding the c-MYCmediated modulation of glycolysis and glutamine
metabolism in cancer cells [3]. Resistance to therapy
is an inherent part of the pro-tumorigenic program
and, almost invariably, an adverse prognostic factor
for solid and non-solid tumors. Emergence within the
tumor mass, of distinct chemoresistant cell populations
has been recognized as an important mechanism for
chemoresistance, hence tumor relapse. We and others
have characterized chemoresistant cell subpopulations
from breast and mesothelioma cell lines and shown that

It appears increasingly clear that the stable
acquisition of a cancer phenotype involves metabolic
remodeling. This echoes the pioneering studies from Otto
Warburg and can be achieved through redirecting glucose
and non glucose-dependent pathways toward anabolic
generation of macromolecules, a crucial requirement
for cancer cells[1, 2]. As a proof of this, multilayered
modulation of metabolic enzymes by known oncogenes
and tumor suppressors has been recently unveiled, with

those cells are endowed with Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal
(EMT) features, exhibit a precursor-like phenotype
and possess high levels of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity [4, 5]. ALDH belongs to a class of
detoxifying enzymes whose expression is linked to cancer
chemoresistance [6, 7] and, by virtue of those high levels
of ALDH activity, chemoresistant cell subpopulations
can be tracked by FACS (ALDHbright cells). We and others
have shown that breast, ALDHbright-enriched cancer cell
subpopulations are resistant in vitro to campthotecin,
cisplatin, etoposide, topotecan [5] and docetaxel (in
vivo) [8]. Tanei et al have reported that ALDH1+ cells
are increased in a group of 78 breast cancer patients after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [9] and such phenomenon
has been shown to occur in early passage colon cancer
xenograft tumors as well [10]. Consequently, ALDH
expression can be an important prognostic factor [6,
11]. Little is known regarding the metabolic features
of the ALDHbright chemoresistant cell subpopulations.
Here we explore which are the metabolic features of
the chemoresistant ALDHbright cells and whether their
metabolic characteristics reflect their functional properties.
This may add precious knowledge to the mechanisms of
tumor relapse and its modulation, to achieve anticancer
effects. With regard to this latter point, metformin, an
oral anti-diabetic biguanide, has been shown to target
chemoresistant putative cancer stem cells from a variety
of solid tumors, including lung, prostate, ovary cancer and
glioma [12-14]. We and others have shown that metformin
interferes with tumor engraftment and synergizes with
chemotherapy in mouse xenografts, with both effects that
suggest the targeting of chemoresistant, tumor initiating
cell populations within the tumor mass. Additionally, we
have shown a metabolic anticancer effect of metformin on
unfractionated breast cancer cells lines which is partially
dependent on DICER-mediated microRNA modulation
[15]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have detailed
the effect of metformin on purified chemoresistant cells
in terms of metabolic modulation and microRNA
modulation, in particular whether the metabolic effect of
metformin are similar or different from those we described
on unfractionated cell populations. Thus, here we studied
the metabolic features of ALDHbright cells isolated from
three histologically different breast cancer cell lines. We
first show that ALDHbright cells are metabolically different
from ALDHlow cells. Subsequently, we describe how
metformin treatment affects ALDHbright cell metabolism
by reducing the differences between the chemoresistant
ALDHbright and the chemosensitive ALDHlow cells through
targeting pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis, glutathione
metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, HIF-1α and the
insulin signalling pathways. Additionally, we show that
metformin treatment largely modulated the microRNA
expression profile of ALDHbright cells and did so by
broadly modulating microRNAs predicted to impinge on
cell metabolism and to target the mentioned pathways.

Finally, we show that metformin modulated master cancer
metabolic modulators such as c-MYC and IRS2 in the
ALDHbright cells and this correlated with modulation of
the microRNA-33a which is known to target both the
abovementioned factors. We believe this study adds on
what is known on the anticancer metabolic actions of
metformin and further provides a rationale for its potential
use combined with chemotherapy to prevent tumor
relapse, through targeting of chemoresistant, residual cell
subpopulations.

RESULTS
FACS-based isolation of breast cancer ALDHbright
and ALDHlow cells (Fig.1).
We determined by FACS the percentage of cells
endowed with high ALDH activity (ALDHbright cells)
from MCF-7, BT-474 and SUM-159 cell lines. ALDH
enzymatic activity was detected by following the
accumulation of a fluorescent ALDH substrate, with
the mean fluorescence of cells pretreated with a known
inhibitor of the ALDH activity (DEAB) set as background
(Fig 1A-B). We found that all the breast cancer cell lines
in our collection contained readily detectable ALDHbright
cells, although with some variability among each cell
line. Given the involvement of the ALDHbright cells in
mediating cancer chemoresistance, we treated MCF-7,
BT-474 and SUM159 cells with cisplatin and doxorubicin,
two commonly used chemotherapy agents for breast
cancer and we evaluated the percentage of ALDHbright
cells among the surviving cell populations. We found
that, upon chronic treatment with cisplatin (40µM, 72hrs)
or doxorubicin (0.1µM, 72hrs) the percentage of breast
cancer ALDHbright cells increased in BT-474 and SUM-159
cells and remained unchanged or only slightly decreased
in the MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A-B and Suppl. Fig.1).
Interestingly, a barely detectable number of ALDHbright
cells was found in the dysplastic, non-transformed breast
cells MCF10A (1.4 ± 0.4 %)(Fig.1B and Suppl. Fig.1).
This is in agreement with previous work [5]. However,
the MCF-10A ALDHbright cells became undetectable upon
cisplatin and doxorubicin treatment (Fig.1B and Suppl.
Fig.1), in agreement with the chemosensitivity of the cell
line[16]. Clonogenic assays with FACS-purified ALDHbright
and ALDHlow cells confirmed that the ALDHbright cells in
the transformed breast cancer cell lines represented the
main chemoresistant cell subpopulation as compared to
the ALDHlow cells (the latter representing most of the
cells in unsorted cell lines) (Fig. 1C-D). The availability
of the described experimental system prompted us to
characterize the metabolic profile of the purified ALDHbright
chemoresistant cell subpopulations.

of the system. In Fig. 2A, the PC1 (the most important
metabolic component explaining 21% of total variance
of the samples) and PC2 (the second most important
metabolic component explaining 13% of total variance
of the samples) discriminated between the conditioned
media of the BT-474, MCF-7 and SUM-159 cell lines.
Being the three breast cancer cell lines histologically and
biologically very different, this was partially expected.
To a minor extent, the PC1/PC2 plane was also capable
of discriminating the subpopulation state (ALDHbright or
ALDHlow). To detail more the previous observations we
carried out an ANOVA test on the component scores
relative to the BT-474, MCF-7 and SUM-159 samples by
establishing, as sources of variation, the cell subpopulation
(ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells) and the cell line (MCF7, BT-474 and SUM-159) (Suppl. Table 1).This analysis
showed that the cell line differences acted as a major

The conditioned media from FACS sorted
ALDHbright and ALDHlow MCF-7, BT-474 and SUM-159

profiles identified at the beginning of observation were
compared to those representing the end of the experiment
(after 24 hours). In this way the resulting positive net
balances indicated release or production of metabolites,
whereas negative net balances indicated uptake or
consumption of metabolites. We analyzed the NMR data
by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) carried
out on untreated samples. This unsupervised method
allows orthogonal decomposition of variance associated
with the analyzed metabolites. Six components (PC
1-6) were sufficient to explain 65% of total variability

factor affecting the distribution of the samples (F statistics
= 98.42 and 432.77 for PC1 and PC2, respectively).
However, the difference among the cell subpopulations
(ALDHbright vs ALDHlow) common to all cell lines was
detectable by the PC1 and PC4 components (F statistics
= 35.54 and 28.08 for PC1 and PC4, respectively). The
ALDHbright vs ALDHlow difference, cell line dependent, was
detectable by the PC1 and PC3 components (F statistics
= 20.76 and 18.39 for PC1 and PC3, respectively). The
detectable impact of the ALDHbright vs ALDHlow condition
on the whole metabolic profile of the samples analyzed
prompted us to exclude the major effect of the cell line
and to focus on the differences between ALDHbright and
ALDHlow cell samples by using the orthogonal projections
to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) (Fig.
2B). The OPLS-DA model generated one Latent Variable
(LV) that explained 55% of the X-variance and 100% of
Y-variance with a cumulative predicted fraction of the
joint X and Y variation of 85%. A clear separation between
the ALDHlow and ALDHbright populations was found in
the first component (LV1) independently from cell type
(while the metabolic difference between the cell lines
were observed on LV0) (Fig. 2B). From the analysis of the
O-PLS-DA loadings we observed that 3-hydroxy-butyrate,
alanine, lactate, acetate, succinate, glucose and formate
were the main discriminatory metabolites responsible
for the difference between ALDHbright and ALDHlow cell
subpopulations (Table 1).

Next, we tested the effect of metformin on the
metabolic processes of the ALDHbright and ALDHlow
cell subpopulations. More specifically, we detailed the
1
H-NMR profile of the conditioned media from the
ALDHbright and ALDHlow subpopulations of BT-474, MCF7 and SUM-159 cells treated with vehicle (PBS1X) or
metformin at a non cytotoxic concentration/length of
treatment combination (0.5mM-24hrs) (Suppl. Fig. 2).
This was done to avoid interference of apoptotic processes
with the 1H-NMR analysis.
PCA analysis of the vehicle- and metformintreated ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells from all three breast
cancer cell lines was very complex and revealed, again, a
predominant effect of the differences among the parental
cell lines (thus masking the effect of metformin treatment)
(Suppl. Table 2). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of
metformin treatment on the ALDHbright and ALDHlow cell
subpopulations for each cell line independently. The PCA
results for each dataset are depicted in Figure 3A-C, where
the score plots for the first two model components are
shown. A clear separation among control and metformintreated samples for each subpopulation was obtained. This
revealed that the PC1 (for the BT-474 and SUM-159 cells),
and the PC2 (for the MCF-7) were mainly responsible
for the differences between vehicle- and metformin-

treated ALDHbright and ALDHlow cell subpopulations.
The quantitative PCA approach revealed that, when
considering the same metabolic process for both cell
subpopulations, the effects of metformin were more
evident in the ALDHbright as compared to the ALDHlow cells.
The maximum difference between the metformin- and
vehicle-treated groups (thus, the maximum drug effect)
was observed for the BT-474 and SUM-159 ALDHbright
cells on the PC1 and for the MCF-7 ALDHbright cells on the
PC2 (Suppl. Table 3). Notably, we found that the treatment
with metformin reduced the difference between ALDHbright
and ALDHlow cells. More specifically, we found that, for
each cell line, the Euclidean distance (arrows) between
the centroids (i.e, the barycenter of the group of samples)
(stars) (Fig. 3A-C) of the treated ALDHlow and ALDHbright
samples was smaller than the distance between the treated
ALDHlow and the untreated ALDHbright samples, suggesting
that Metformin changed the metabolism of ALDHbright
towards a phenotype more similar to that of metformintreated ALDHlow cells This was very evident for the SUM159 cell line.

Next, we detailed the metabolic profiles relative to
the vehicle- and metformin- treated ALDHbright cells (Fig.
4A-E). For each cell line, the PCA produced solutions with
two significant components, explaining about 52%, 65%
and 47% of the total variability of the system for the MCF7, BT-474, and SUM-159 cells, respectively (data not
shown). This highlighted significant differences between
the two groups on the PC1. Additionally, despite some
differences between the cell lines, we observed similarities
in the correlation patterns of metabolite loadings (Fig.
4A-E). For each cell line, the PC1 included the following
variables with the highest correlation levels: glutamine
and glucose consumption and pyroglutamate production
with positive loadings as well as lactate production with
negative loadings. Therefore, the PC1 analysis indicated
that metformin treatment induced higher consumption
of glutamine and glucose as well as higher production
of lactate (positive correlation with PC1) compared to
untreated cells (Fig. 4C-E).
The negative correlation between glutamine and
glucose consumption and lactate production in the

loading plots of the ALDHbright cells from all the analysed
cell lines suggested higher fluxes through glycolysis or
glutaminolysis in the treated cells compared to untreated
controls. Previous studies using NMR analysis with
[1,2-13C]-glucose revealed that, in metformin-treated cells,
lactate is more produced from glutaminolysis rather than
from glycolysis therefore suggesting that the net effect of
metformin consists of a reduction of the glycolytic flux.
A lower production of pyroglutamate upon metformin
treatment was also observed (negative correlation with
PC1). A lower excretion of pyroglutamate suggested
a reduced level of intracellular glutathione. In facts,
pyroglutamate, also known as 5-oxoproline, is converted
to glutamate by 5-Oxoprolinase. As glutamate is required
in the first step of GSH synthesis, the lower production of
pyroglutamate observed in treated cells suggest a minor
level of intracellular glutathione. Moreover, in MCF-7 and
BT-474 cell lines, we observed that glucose and glutamine
consumption correlated also with the production of
alanine (opposite loadings) suggesting a higher activation
of alanine aminotransferases in the metformin-treated
cells. However, the fact that acetate was a strong negative
loader on PC1 for BT-474, demonstrated that the alanine
aminotransferase pathway was also used to provide
precursors needed for fatty acid synthesis. Nevertheless,
the higher excretion of acetate into media of the
metformin-treated cells reflected the smaller availability
of acetyl-CoA units for fatty acid synthesis. For the MCF7 and BT-474 cells, the negative correlation of 3-methyl2-oxovalerate and 2-oxo-4-methylvalerate loadings within
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the metformin-treated cells as opposed to the controltreated cells indicated a higher metabolic flux through the
branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase pathway.
This strongly suggests the use of branched amino acids
for energy production instead of its use for macromolecule
biosynthesis in the metformin-treated cells. Analysis of the
identified metabolites with the KEEG pathways indicated
that, in all three ALDHbright cell subpopulations treated with
metformin, we observed perturbations of the glycolysis,
pyruvate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, purine and
pyrimidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate, glutamate,
arginine and proline metabolism , pentose phosphate
pathway, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism,
HIF-1α and the insulin signalling pathways in all cell lines
(Table 2).
Metformin-mediated modulation of microRNAs
sustains its metabolic effects on the ALDHbright cells (Fig. 5
and 6). We previously demonstrated that metformin exerts
anticancer metabolic effect on unsorted breast cancer
cell populations by broadly modulating the metabolic
pathways, at least partially in a DICER-dependent
microRNA modulation[15]. We verified whether a similar
mechanism would take place in the sorted ALDHbright
cells and whether this may explain the metabolic changes
observed in the treated cells. Therefore, we analysed the
microRNA expression profile of vehicle- and metformintreated, FACS sorted ALDHbright cells (Fig. 5). This first
revealed that, at steady state, the microRNA expression
profile of ALDHlow and ALDHbright was very different,
mirroring the observed difference in their metabolic

profile. In facts, the unsupervised PCA analysis of 497
expressed microRNAs in the ALDHlow and ALDHbright
cell subpopulations revealed a clear separation of the two
cell subpopulations on both the PC1 and the PC2 (61.5%
and 18.1% of the total variance, respectively)(Fig.5A).
Next, we evaluated the microRNA expression profile of
vehicle- and metformin- treated ALDHbright and ALDHlow
cells derived from the SUM-159 cells. This provided us
with two observations: first, metformin treatment induced
changes in microRNA expression levels in both ALDH
bright
and ALDHlow cells (Fig.5B), with a slightly more
evident effect on the ALDHbright cells; second, metformin
treatment reduced the distance in the microRNA
expression profile between ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells

(Fig. 5B). This was reminiscent of the metabolic effects
of the drug on the ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells, which
were consistent with the acquisition of a more similar
metabolic profile between the two cell subpopulations.
Altogether, these observations suggest that metformin
treatment of breast cancer ALDHbright cells partially
reverted a chemoresistant and clonogenic phenotype
to a chemosensitive, more differentiated one. In order
to support this observation, we detailed the microRNA
modulation in the metformin treated-ALDHbright cells
(Fig.6A) Interestingly, a large fraction (89/125) of the
microRNAs significantly modulated in the metformintreated ALDHbright cells (Suppl. Table 4) was predicted to
target metabolic pathways (Table 3) and caused a strong

due to a mir-33a-dependent modulation of c-MYC levels
[15]. In facts, C-MYC is a central modulator of cancer cell
metabolism, alone or in cooperation with HIF-1α [17, 18].
To assess whether a similar mechanism would operate in
the ALDHbright cancer cells as well, we evaluated the levels
of microRNA 33a and its target c-MYC in ALDHbright
cells, treated with vehicle or metformin, respectively.
By performing quantitative PCR, we observed a strong
modulation of mir-33a levels which anti-correlated with
those of c-MYC. Additionally, we found that the levels of
IRS-2, a central modulator of insulin signalling in normal
and cancer cells and a target of microRNA33a as well [19]
were modulated by metformin (Fig. 7). A working model
that generally resumes the collected observations is shown
in Fig. 8 (Fig. 8).

in the ALDHbright cell subpopulations may underlie the
anticancer action of metformin. In facts, higher levels of
intracellular glutathione have been described in chemoand radio-resistant “cancer stem cell –like (CSCs)” cell
subpopulations derived from MMTV-WNT1 breast
tumors[23]. Additionally, this correlated with a broad
modulation of the mRNA levels of the genes involved in
the glutathione metabolism. We speculate that metformin
treatment may reduce the glutathione pool in the breast
ALDHbright cell subpopulations thereby abating their
resistance to therapy. Interestingly, recent findings suggest
that blockage of c-MYC downstream effectors affected
glycolysis and glutathione biosynthesis in MYC-driven
mouse lymphoma models[24]. In line with this, we have
found that metformin downregulated the c-MYC levels
in ALDHbright cells, possibly by upregulating the mir33a levels. C-MYC activation in ALDHbright cells may
strongly cooperate with the activation of HIF-1 metabolic
effectors, such as several glycolytic enzymes [3, 25, 26].
The latter phenomenon was observed by our 1H-NMR
analysis. Additionally, IRS-2 is downregulated by
metformin and, like for c-MYC, this inversely correlated
with the levels of mir-33a in the metformin treated cells.
IRS-2 is an important modulator of aerobic glycolysis in
mouse mammary cancer cells [27]. Notably, modulation
of c-MYC and IRS-2 mRNA levels was already shown
by us in unfractionated, metformin treated breast cells
lines [15]. What we believe is remarkable here is that
the treatment with metformin drastically reduced the
metabolic difference between ALDHbright and ALDHlow
cells. A very similar effect was observed on the microRNA
expression profile of metformin treated ALDHbright and
ALDHlow cells. This is very interesting since the ALDHlow
cells represent the chemosensitive fraction of solid tumors
and it indicates the potential of metformin for metabolic
reprogramming of chemoresistant cell subpopulations.
This represents a further mechanism of cancer interference
by this promising compound (Fig. 8).

DISCUSSION
We have recently shown that a complex interplay of
microRNA modulation and pathway signalling underlies
the anticancer effects of metformin, an anti-diabetic
agent which epidemiological evidence suggest to play
an important role in cancer prevention [15, 20, 21]. With
the aim of detailing our previous studies, in this work we
have studied the metabolic changes taking place in breast
ALDHbright cells, the main cell subpopulation responsible
for the chemoresistance of breast tumors. This because
understanding the metabolism of chemoresistant cell
subpopulations may aid the identification of the basic
mechanism sustaining their chemoresistance, a major
factor shaping the prognosis of breast cancer patients.
Our experimental systems included three breast cancer
cell lines, differing for histological origin and growth
rate. Indeed, our metabolomics analysis identified the cell
line specificity as a major determinant of the differences
between the samples, thus confirming the efficiency
of the approach. Despite this, the OPLS-DA analysis
allowed us to focus on the differences between vehicleand metformin- treated ALDHbright cells. First, we found
that the metabolic profile of the purified ALDHbright cell
subpopulations was significantly different from that of the
ALDHlow cells. When focusing on the metabolic changes
induced by metformin treatment and common to the
ALDHbright cells from all the cell lines examined (MCF7, BT-474, SUM-159-ALDHbright cells), an increase in
glucose and glutamine uptake and lactate production as
well as the decrease in pyroglutamate production were
observed upon metformin treatment. Interestingly, a
reduced excretion of pyroglutamate from the metformintreated cells indicated reduced levels of intracellular
glutathione. This is in line with recent findings showing
that metformin affected the glutathione (GSH) homeostasis
of breast cancer cells, with the reduced glutathione
biosynthesis correlating with a blockage of de novo
purine/pyrimidine synthesis[22]. Our observations suggest
that negative modulation of the glutathione homeostasis

2,2,3,3-d4 acid] and 10 mM NaN3 solution in D2O 0.1
M phosphate buffer (pH=7.4), while non-polar extracts
were dissolved in 600μl of CDCl3 containing 0.03% TMS
(tetramethylsilane) / CD3OD solution (2:1, v/v).
All 2D 1H J-resolved (JRES) NMR spectra
were acquired on a 500 MHz DRX Bruker Avance
spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using a double spin echo
sequence with 8 transients per increment for a total of 32
increments. These were collected into 16k data points
using spectral widths of 6 kHz in F2 and 40 Hz in F1.
There was a 3.0 s relaxation delay. The water resonance
was suppressed using presaturation. Each FID was Fourier
transformed after a multiplication with sine-bell window
functions in both dimensions. JRES spectra were tilted
by 45°, symmetrised about F1, referenced to TSP at δH
= 0.0 ppm and the proton-decoupled skyline projections
(p-JRES) exported using Bruker’s XWIN-NMR software.
Metabolites were identified using an in-house NMR
database and literature data and confirmed by 2D homoand heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. 1H-NMR spectra
pre-processing. All p-JRES exported were aligned and
then reduced into spectral bins with widths ranging from
0.01 to 0.02 ppm by using the ACD intelligent bucketing
method (ACD/Labs, Canada) that sets the bucket divisions
at local minima (within the spectra) to ensure that each
resonance is in the same bin throughout all spectra. After
this procedure, the 1H spectra were divided into n bins.
The area within each spectral bin was integrated to yield
a n-component vector, where each component value was
represented by the integral value corresponding to the
specific spectral bin. To compare the spectra, the integrals
derived from the bucketing procedure were normalized
to the total integral region, following exclusion of bins
corresponding to solvent (residual water/HDO, δ4.764.82 ppm; CDCl3, δ 7.45-7.50 ppm; CD3OD,δ 3.33-3.37
ppm), TSP, TMS (δ -0.5-0.5 ppm) and metformin peaks
(δ3.03-3.06 ppm). Data from extracellular media were
expressed in terms of net balances at 0 and 24hrs. This to
establish consumption (c) or production (p) of the selected
metabolites in time.

ALDH activity assay.
ALDH activity was detected by FACS CALIBUR
instrument (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,
USA). ALDEFLUOR kit (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. ALDHbright cells were defined
as the cells that displayed greater fluorescence compared
with a control staining reaction containing the ALDH
inhibitor, DEAB (diethylaminobenzaldehyde). The
analysis was performed by using FlowingSoftware 2.0
(Cell Imaging Core, University of Turku, Finland).

Cell Sorting.
ALDEFLUOR kit was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to detect the ALDH activity.
Cells were filtered through a 40µM mesh to obtain a
single cell suspension . Cell sorting was performed with a
MoFLO cell sorter (DAKOCYTOMATION ,Fort Collins,
Colorado, USA)

Cell Viability.
The SYTOX® Orange Dead Cell Stain( InvitrogenMolecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to assess
cell viability as per manufacturer’s instructions.

Clonogenic assays.
The breast cancer cell lines were grown to 70%
confluence and pulse treated with the indicated drugs.
16hrs later, cells were detached(Accutase-GIBCO) and
seeded at 500-1500 cells/well into 6-well dishes (CorningCostar, Tewksbury, MA, USA) in drug-free media. Fresh
medium (25%) was added every three days. Colonies were
stained with crystal violet (SIGMA) and colonies (>50
cells) counted after 7- 14 days

Univariate statistical data analysis.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a technique
for analysing experimental data in which one or more
(or dependent) variables are measured under various
conditions, identified by one or more classification
variables. The response is separated into variation
attributable to differences between the classification
variables and variation attributable to random errors.
An analysis of variance constructs tests to determine the
significance of the classification effects. A typical goal is
to compare means of the response variables for various
combinations of the classification variables (interaction
effects).
In our study, we considered metabolite consumption

production of metabolites as X matrix and type of
subpopulation as Y matrix. The influence of the original
variables on the obtained model was determined using
loading values.

RNA processing and hybridization
Total RNA from the FACS sorted ALDHbright
and ALDHlow cells (98 ± 0.4% and 97 ± 1.4% purity,
respectively, as assessed by re-FACS) was extracted by
TRI Reagent lysis reagent (Life Technologies-AMBION
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The microRNA Complete Labeling and
Hyb Kit (AGILENT Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to
generate fluorescent miRNA, according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Scanning and image analysis were performed
using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (P/N
G2565BA). Feature Extraction Software (V-10.5) was
used for data extraction from raw microarray image files
using the miRNA_105_Dec-09FE protocol.

Principal Component Analysis.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a projection
method used for exploiting the information embedded in
multidimensional data sets. The data is reduced to a few
latent variables (or principal components) collecting the
information implicit in the original variables correlation
structure. The presence of correlations between the original
variables allows for the reduction of dimensionality of
the data set in the new space without noticeable loss of
information. The extracted components (PCs) are each
orthogonal and ordered in terms of percentage of explained
variation, with the first components collecting the
‘signal’ (correlated) portion of information, while minor
components can be considered as ‘noise’ components.
Because the principal components are, by construction,
orthogonal to each other, a clear-cut separation of the
different and independent features characterizing the
data set is made possible. Each statistical unit is assigned
a score relative to each extracted component, while the
correlation coefficient between each original variable
and extracted components (loading) gives a meaning to
the PCs. The output from the PCA analysis consists of
score plots, which provide an indication of the differences
between the classes in terms of metabolic similarity, and
loading plots. These loading plots give an indication of
which metabolite net balances are important with respect
to the classification obtained in the score plots.

Analysis of microRNA expression.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated in
order to assess quality of replicates. ANOVA test α=5%)
was performed to assess statistical significance of the
observed differences in microRNA profiling (Fig.S2).

Preprocessing.
The signal of 851 human miRNAs was processed
by MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc.) in in house-built
routines. All background-subtracted intensity values lower
than 1 were considered below detection and thresholded to
1. The arrays were quantile-normalized forcing each slide
to assume the same mean distribution and log2-trasformed.
Feature selection. Clusters in data were identified
by unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering and Principal
Component Analysis. A permutation t-test and bootstrap
test were used to select deregulated miRNAs after
treatment. A false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was
also applied for multiple comparisons. All tests were
two-tailed and considered significant if both p-value and
q-value (FDR) were less than 0.05.

Orthogonal projections to latent structures
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)
Orthogonal projections to latent structures
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is a supervised
pattern recognition technique widely used in the field
of metabolomics to interpret large multivariate data sets
describing differences between the groups under study in
a straightforward and accurate way.
OPLS-DA separates the systematic variation in
the matrix X (spectroscopic data) into two parts, one
linearly related (variation of interest) to the matrix Y (the
classification variables) and one orthogonally related (so
called orthogonal variation or structured noise) to the
matrix Y. This partitioning of the X-data improved the
interpretation of the model.
In our study, we considered consumption and

miRNA-pathway assignment prediction.
A list of predicted miRNAs in pathway
experimentally identified from metabolomics was
extracted using miRWalk (http://www.umm.uniheidelberg.de/apps/zmf/mirwalk/)[32]. Predicted miRNAs
with significant modulation of the signal after treatment
in the array experiment were considered for further
investigations.
