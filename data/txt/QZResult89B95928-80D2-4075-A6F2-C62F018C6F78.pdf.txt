ABSTRACT:
Although minoxidil has been used for more than two decades to treat androgenetic
alopecia (AGA), an androgen-androgen receptor (AR) pathway-dominant disease, its
precise mechanism of action remains elusive. We hypothesized that minoxidil may
influence the AR or its downstream signaling. These tests revealed that minoxidil
suppressed AR-related functions, decreasing AR transcriptional activity in reporter
assays, reducing expression of AR targets at the protein level, and suppressing
AR-positive LNCaP cell growth. Dissecting the underlying mechanisms, we found
that minoxidil interfered with AR-peptide, AR-coregulator, and AR N/C-terminal
interactions, as well as AR protein stability. Furthermore, a crystallographic analysis
using the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) revealed direct binding of minoxidil to the
AR in a minoxidil-AR-LBD co-crystal model, and surface plasmon resonance assays
demonstrated that minoxidil directly bound the AR with a Kd value of 2.6 µM. Minoxidil
also suppressed AR-responsive reporter activity and decreased AR protein stability in
human hair dermal papilla cells. The current findings provide evidence that minoxidil
could be used to treat both cancer and age-related disease, and open a new avenue
for applications of minoxidil in treating androgen-AR pathway-related diseases.

INTRODUCTION

steroid hormone receptor superfamily. Prior to androgen
binding, the AR is associated with the chaperone proteins
HSP70 and HSP90. Upon androgen binding, the androgenAR complex undergoes a conformational change and
translocates to nucleus, where it forms a dimer on target
gene promoters and turns on target gene transcription. This
process is assisted by an array of coregulators [6].
Testosterone, the major androgen in the
circulation, is converted to the more potent androgen,
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), via 5α-reductase in tissue.
Two types of 5α-reductase isoenzymes have been
described, type I and type II, the latter of which is more
highly expressed in AGA follicles than in follicles
of normal controls [7]. The AR is also expressed at
significantly higher levels in balding than non-balding
scalp follicles in AGA [8]. Men with Kennedy’s disease,
who harbor dysfunctional ARs with long polyQ repeats in

The androgen-androgen receptor (AR) pathway is
involved in a wide range of physiological development
and disease processes. Notable in this latter context is
androgenetic alopecia (AGA). In AGA, the androgenAR pathway may affect hair growth in a paradoxical
pattern at puberty, inhibiting hair growth in the scalp of
genetically predisposed individuals but enhancing hair
growth at most other body sites outside the scalp area.
AGA is the most frequent cause of hair loss in men [1].
Balding may be inherited in a polygenetic manner, and
genetic predispositions, including AR polymorphisms
in chromosome Xq12 [2] and single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in chromosome 20p11 [3, 4] and
chromosome 3q26 [5], have been linked to AGA.
The AR is a transcription factor that belongs to the

the N-terminus, have significantly thicker hair and a lower
risk of AGA [9]. Furthermore, the AR coregulator Hic5/
ARA55 is more richly expressed in balding frontal scalp
papilla cells than in occipital area cells [10]. There is also
a literature report that DHT-inducible DKK1 (Dickkopfrelated protein 1) from balding dermal papilla causes
apoptosis in follicular cells [11]. These data support the
concept that the activity of the androgen-AR signaling
pathway may play an important role in AGA pathogenesis.
Minoxidil was introduced clinically in the early
1970s as an anti-hypertension medication, but was found
to have the side effect of hypertrichosis, an abnormal
amount of hair growth over the body [12]. Currently,
minoxidil is approved for topical therapy of AGA and
is available as 2% and 5% solutions and as a 5% foam
formulation. Both 2% and 5% solutions were shown to
arrest hair lost on the vertex and frontal scalp in most
patients, but exhibited lower efficacy in stimulating hair
regrowth [1]. In minoxidil responders, maintenance
therapy was needed. The therapeutic mechanism of
minoxidil action in AGA is uncertain, but a number of
possibilities, including vasodilation [13], angiogenesis
[14], enhanced cell proliferation [15], modulation of
potassium channel conductance [16] and regulation of
prostaglandin [17, 18], have been proposed.
Previous studies have consistently concluded that
minoxidil does not act directly through an androgen effect
[19, 20]. However, it nevertheless influences the androgenAR pathway-dominant disease, AGA, prompting us to
hypothesize that minoxidil does indeed affect AR-related
functions. To test this speculative relationship between
minoxidil and AR, we performed a series of experimental
and modeling studies.

studies, high concentrations, ranging from 1-100 mM,
have been reported in skin tissue [31, 32]. After treating
with different concentrations of minoxidil (1 to 100 µM),
cells were harvested and cellular extracts were assayed
for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, minoxidil
suppressed AR reporter activity at the concentrations
tested.
To further clarify whether minoxidil suppresses
human AR target gene transcription, we co-transfected
PC-3 cells with PSG5-AR and a PSA-Luc reporter
construct containing 1.5 kb of the prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) promoter linked to the luciferase gene. As shown
in Fig. 1B, minoxidil suppressed AR transcriptional
activity in this PSA-Luc reporter assay. Furthermore, as
shown in Fig. 1C (PSA, lanes 3 and 4 vs. lane 2), this
phenomenon translated into a decrease in PSA protein
level after treatment with minoxidil for 72 h. These data
further support the conclusion that minoxidil is capable of
suppressing AR-related functions.
Clinically, anti-androgens are used to treat prostate
cancer. To further test minoxidil suppression of ARrelated function, we tested the effects of minoxidil on the
growth of LNCaP cells, an androgen-sensitive prostate
cancer cell line that, as noted above, endogenously
expresses AR. As shown in Fig. 1D, minoxidil suppressed
DHT-dependent LNCaP cell growth in concentrationdependent manner. Notably, at the highest concentration,
cell growth was suppressed to a level comparable to that
observed in the absence of DHT. These data provide the
first demonstration that minoxidil can suppress AR-related
functions, including AR transcription and AR-related cell
growth.
To assess possible nonspecific effects of minoxidil
at high concentrations, we performed control studies,
testing different concentrations of minoxidil (1-100 µM)
on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcriptional activity.
As shown in Fig. 1E, the highest concentration minoxidil
(100 µM) did affect GR transcriptional activity in reporter
assays in PC-3 cells, whereas lower concentrations (1-10
µM) did not. These data suggest that minoxidil, a small
hydrophobic molecule, may have multiple targets in the
cell when used at high concentrations.

RESULTS
Minoxidil suppresses AR transactivation and
target gene expression
Minoxidil has been used to treat the AR-related
disease, AGA, for more than two decades, suggesting that
it may interfere with AR-related functions. To investigate
this possibility, we first tested minoxidil in an AR
transcription reporter assay using LNCaP prostate cancer
cells, which harbor an endogenous AR with a T877A
mutation. Cells were transiently transfected with an ARresponsive MMTV (mouse mammalian tumor virus)-Luc
construct and treated with different concentrations of
minoxidil. Minoxidil concentrations were chosen based on
most common reports in the literature: 0.1 to 10 µM for
oral intake and about 1 mM for topical application of 5%
minoxidil (100 mM) in skin tissue (Regaine 5% minoxidil
topical solution; monograph, February 2013), assuming
1.7% absorption. In in vitro organ culture or animal

Minoxidil blocks FxxLF motif-containing peptideAR, cofactor-AR, and AR N-C interactions
We next investigated the mechanism underlying
the ability of minoxidil to suppress AR-related functions.
Full transcriptional activity of the AR requires the
assistance of coregulators. Phage display and real AR
coregulator analyses have shown that an FxxLF-like motif
in coregulators mediates coregulator-AR interactions.
To determine whether disruption of these interactions
contributes to the suppression of AR-related function by
minoxidil, we first examined the effect of minoxidil on the

interaction between an FxxLF-containing peptide and the
AR. In these experiments, PC-3 cells were co-transfected
with an FxxLF-containing peptide (GAL4-DBD-3-18), an
expression plasmid for full-length AR (VP16-AR), and a
pG5-Luc construct. After treating with DHT and different
concentrations of minoxidil, cell extracts were assayed
for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, minoxidil
inhibited FxxLF-containing peptide-AR interactiondependent reporter activity in a concentration-dependent
manner, suggesting that minoxidil interferes with peptideAR interactions. Using this same experimental paradigm,

we further tested minoxidil effects on coregulator-AR
interactions, substituting ARA54C, a C-terminal construct
of the coactivator ARA54 (androgen receptor associated
protein 54), for the FxxLF-containing peptide. As was
the case for the isolated FxxLF-containing peptide, the
transcription-enhancing effect of ARA54C was inhibited
by minoxidil, consistent with the idea that minoxidil
interferes with the interaction of the ARA54 C-terminus
with the AR (Fig. 2B).
Formation of an AR dimer, which is required for
transcriptional activity, involves an interaction between

AR N- and C-termini mediated by the AR N-terminal
FxxLF motif. Co-expressing truncated AR N- and
C-termini recapitulated this AR N-C interaction, turning on
target gene expression (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). As shown
in Fig. 2C, minoxidil at concentrations ranging from 10
to 100 µM suppressed this induction of transcriptional
activity, suggesting that minoxidil also disrupts AR N- and
C-terminal interactions, providing an addition mechanism
for minoxidil suppression of AR-related function.

course of AR protein disappearance by Western blotting.
As shown in Fig. 2D, minoxidil induced a decrease in AR
protein that was most evident 8 h after treatment, at which
point AR protein levels were 36% of pretreatment values.
We further found that this decrease in AR protein levels
was dependent on minoxidil concentration, as shown in
Fig. 2E. These observations suggest that the mechanism
of action of minoxidil may include a decreased in AR
stability.

Minoxidil decreases AR stability

DHT-AR-LBD and minoxidil co-crystal model

AR blockade has been shown to influence AR
protein stability [33]. To test minoxidil effects on AR
protein stability, we treated cells with 10 µM minoxidil for
different lengths of time in the presence of cyclohexamide
to block new protein synthesis and examined the time

The ability of minoxidil to reduce AR protein
stability, taken together with the apparent interference
with cofactor-AR and AR N- and C-terminal interactions
by minoxidil, suggests that minoxidil may bind directly
to the AR. To confirm this hypothesis, we attempted to

co-crystalize a mixture of minoxidil, AR-LBD, and DHT.
AR-LBD was successfully crystalized in the presence
of DHT and minoxidil, and the structure of the resulting
complex was diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution (Fig. 3A). An
electron density map of a single subunit could be built
from residues 670 to 918 in the protein, revealing an
asymmetric unit with orthorhombic symmetry. Finally, the
model was refined to yield R and free-R values of 17.0%
and 19.9%, respectively. The overall crystallographic
statistics are given in Supplemental Table 1.
DHT was found to be conjugated in a pocket
surrounded by four residues, Asn705, Gln711, Arg752
and Thr877, with which it formed hydrogen bonds.
Interestingly, the minoxidil molecule could be modeled
as an additional electron density map that was localized

to a previously unreported groove formed by α8 and α11
helices (Fig. 3A, 3B). Several mobile residues from these
two helices, including Glu793, Trp796, Leu797, Tyr857,
Gln858 and Lys861, were found near the minoxidil
molecule (<5 Å). Minoxidil contains N and O atoms that
may act as functional groups to form hydrogen bonds with
these nearby residues. One such interaction involves the
amine group in the pyrimidine ring of minoxidil, which
is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl
group of Glu793 (3.1 Å). Other residues provide a
hydrophobic environment that stabilizes the compound
(Fig. 3C). Although this position is somewhat removed
from the AR-LBD AF2 (activation function 2) site,
which is the main cofactor binding site, it is possible that
minoxidil interferes with coregulator interactions in the

We further performed isothermal titration
calorimetry experiments to analyze the binding affinity
between the drug and protein. After having obtained clear
evidence that the drug bound to the protein, we proceeded
to determine the binding affinity by SPR, analyzing the
interaction of different concentrations of AR-LBD protein
with minoxidil, measured as relative units (RU), as a
function of time (s). As shown in Fig. 3E, the binding
affinity between the minoxidil and AR-LBD protein,
expressed as Kd, was calculated to be 2.6 µM. These
results are consistent with our resolved structure and
results of functional assays.

findings to skin cells, we tested whether minoxidil has
similar effects in HHDPCs (human hair dermal papilla
cells) using an AR reporter assay. AR expression in
HHDPCs was confirmed at mRNA (Fig. 4A) and
protein (Fig. 4B) levels. As shown in Fig. 4C, minoxidil
suppressed AR transcriptional activity in a concentrationdependent manner (compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 2). We
further tested minoxidil effects on AR protein stability
in HHDPCs. As shown in Fig. 4D, minoxidil induced a
concentration-dependent reduction in AR protein stability.
These data provide further evidence that the efficacy of
minoxidil in treating AGA may involve suppression of
AR-related functions.
Minoxidil has been proposed to act as a potassium
channel opener in the context of AGA treatment, an
action that is primarily associated with the SUR2B/Kir6.1
potassium channel subtype in hair follicles [31, 34].

[31], suppressed AR transcriptional activity in a reporter
assay in HHDPCs, as shown in Fig. 4C (compare lane
6 to lane 2). Tests of HHDPCs and various cancer cell
lines further showed that HHDPCs expressed the same
subtype of potassium channel as that found in the prostate
cancer cell line PC-3, which lacks an endogenous AR (Fig.
4E). Notably, minoxidil suppressed AR transcriptional
activity in PC-3 cells, but this effect was not blocked by
tolbutamide (Fig. 4F), suggesting that the suppressive
effect of minoxidil on AR transcriptional activity is not a

be alternative targets in androgen-AR pathway-dominant
diseases. Specifically, ASC-J9, a curcumin derivative that
is in clinical trial for acne treatment, has been reported to
possess AR-degradation–enhancing activity [33, 42].
The potassium channel family, which includes the
KATP channel, is a diverse group of membrane proteins
that has been linked to cell proliferation [43]. These
channels can be expressed in normal prostate gland tissue
and prostate cancer [44]. However, potassium channel
density may be inversely correlated with the metastatic
potential of prostate cancer, with higher expression in
LNCaP cells (low metastatic ability) and lower expression
in PC-3 cells (high metastatic rate) [45]. Minoxidil has
been shown to enhance the growth of PC-3 cells which
express KATP channel but lack an endogenous AR in
serum-free conditions, and some potassium channel
blockers suppress the growth of prostate cancer cell lines
[44]. Our data showed that not all prostate cancer cell
lines express the same subtype of potassium channel (Fig.
4E) and we further found that minoxidil suppressed the
growth of AR-expressing LNCaP cells in a concentrationdependent manner. A number of common drugs that are
used chronically for other indications, such as rapamycin,
metformin, β-blockers, angiotensin-blockers and aspirin,
can protect against cancer [46, 47]. Apart from its actions
as a KATP channel opener in the treatment of hypertension
and AGA, minoxidil may directly bind to the AR and
suppress AR-related functions, including androgensensitive LNCaP cell growth. These data may suggest the
potential of minoxidil in the treatment of prostate cancer.
Interestingly, our structural studies demonstrated
that minoxidil is chelated at a novel, previously unreported
groove in the AR. The residues surrounding the groove
provide hydrophobicity at the surface, whereas the inner
core exhibits hydrophilic properties, implying selectivity
for binding factors. Moreover, the groove is also located
opposite to and at a distance from AF-2 and BF-3 sites
[48]; accordingly, it may represent a new candidate site
for the interaction of AR coregulators (Fig. 3D). To
date, there have been few reports on AR structure and
none has described the role of the groove identified here
in AR action. Mutation of a nearby residue, Cys784, to
Tyr784 in the α8 helix was reported to cause the loss of
transactivation activity in a female patient [49]. In our
model, variations in this region resulted in steric clashes
or changes in secondary structure. By occupying this
grove, minoxidil may hinder the physical association
of interacting proteins, thereby disrupting downstream
regulation of AR transactivation. Taken together with
mutagenesis data, our structural findings suggest that this
groove may be important for binding of AR-interacting
proteins during transactivation. The minoxidil-AR-LBD
co-crystal model thus may provide a platform for the
further development of drugs for the treatment of AGA
and other androgen-AR pathway-related diseases.

DISCUSSION
For more than 20 years, minoxidil has been used to
treat AGA, which is an androgen-AR pathway-dominant
disease. The scientific literature suggests that minoxidil
acts mainly on the hair cycle, shortening telogen [35]
and increasing hair diameter [36]. Minoxidil actions as
an anti-hypertension agent have been mainly attributed
to its potassium channel-opening effect, which has been
linked to the hypertrichosis phenomenon associated
with minoxidil [37]. However, this mechanism is
not compatible with certain findings, including the
observations that potassium channel antagonists are unable
to block minoxidil effects and potassium channels are not
expressed in hair follicle cells [38, 39]. Although a specific
subtype of potassium channel has been identified in human
hair follicles [31, 34], our data suggest that minoxidil
modulation of AR activity does not involve this pathway.
AGA is closely associated with androgen-AR
pathway activity. Previous studies using a golden Syrian
hamster model found no anti-androgenic potential of
minoxidil on androgen-dependent cutaneous structures
[19]. However, female animals were used in these
studies, and testosterone, which can be converted to
estradiol in hair follicles [40], rather than DHT was
chosen. Furthermore, minoxidil treatment increases
17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5α-reductase
activity, which may influence testosterone metabolism
[41]. Recently, the prostaglandin D2 receptor G proteincoupled receptor 44 pathway was shown to play an
important role in AGA pathogenesis [17]. Minoxidil
treatment increases prostaglandin E2 levels, but whether it
influences prostaglandin D2-related pathways is unknown.
Our characterization of the relationship between
minoxidil and AR showed that minoxidil interferes with
AR-related functions, decreasing AR transcriptional
activity, reducing expression of targets at the protein
level, and suppressing AR-positive LNCaP cell growth.
Furthermore, our mechanistic studies showed that the
suppressive effect of minoxidil on AR-related functions
reflected its ability to directly bind to the AR; interfere with
AR-peptide, AR-coregulator and AR N-C interactions; and
reduce AR protein stability. It has been proposed that the
AR and its downstream pathways, but not androgen, may

Materials and plasmids

Transient transfection reporter gene assay

DHT, bicalutamide, cyclohexamide, tolbutamide,
and minoxidil were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO). The cell lines PC-3, LNCaP, LAPC4,
and HepG2 were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human hair dermal
papillae cells (HHDPCs) were purchased from ScienCell
Research Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The plasmids
pSG5-AR, pSG5-GR, Gal-4-ARA54C, Gal-4-peptide,
pCDNA3-AR-N, pCDNA3-AR-C, pCMX-VP16-AR,
MMTV-Luc, PSA-Luc, and pG5-Luc were constructed
as described previously [21, 22]. Anti-AR (N-20) and
anti-PSA (C-19) antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-βactin antibody (MAB1501) was obtained from Millipore
(Billerica, MA).

The PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line was grown
in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 U/
ml penicillin; the LNCaP cell line and HHDPCs were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Culture media for
all cell lines were phenol red-free, and charcoal-treated
fetal bovine serum was used in DHT-related assay. For
transfection, cells were plated in 24-well plates and
transfected with plasmids using a Superfect kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA), as described by the manufacturer. After 16
h of incubation, the cells were treated with ethanol (vehicle
control), steroid hormones, or different concentrations of
minoxidil for an additional 16 h and then harvested for
luciferase assays. Luciferase activity in whole-cell extracts
was measured using a luciferase assay kit, as described by
the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI) and normalized
to the protein concentration in the respective extract. The
results were presented as means ± standard deviations
(SD) of triplicate determinations, expressed relative to
untreated control cells (defined as 1); three independent
transfections were performed.

AR-LBD protein purification and minoxidil-ARLBD co-crystallization
cDNA for the human AR ligand-binding domain
(AR-LBD; amino acids 663-919) was amplified from
pSG5-AR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
inserted into the pET28c vector (Novagen, San Diego,
CA). Protein expression and purification were as
described previously [23]. The DHT-AR-LBD complex
was crystallized at room temperature using the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method. Crystal Screen 2 (Hampton
Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) solution number 20 and
modified buffers were used to monitor DHT-AR-LBD
crystal formation. After crystals had reached 0.7 × 0.7 ×
2.5 mm with a rhombus shape, the DHT-AR-LBD crystals
were transferred to a solution containing 10 mM minoxidil
for 30 min at room temperature. The complex crystal
was flash-cooled by dipping in a cryoprotectant solution
consisting of the reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v)
glycerol, and then was placed in a cold stream at 100K.
The 2.4 Å dataset was collected at the BL13B at
the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in
Hsinchu, Taiwan, using an ADSC Quantum 315r CCD
detector. Indexing and processing of the measured intensity
data were performed using the HKL2000 software package
[24]. The crystal belonged to the space group P212121, with
unit cell parameters of a = 55.43 Å, b = 65.54 Å, c = 70.38
Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. The structures were determined
by the molecular replacement method AMoRe, using the
unliganded AR-LBD structure (PDB code: 1T7T) as the
search model [25]. Refinement was carried out using the
REFMAC5 program [26] and coupled to ARP/wARP [27].
The refined model was checked using the PROCHECK
program [28]. Data collection and refinement statistics

Cell growth assay
LNCaP cells were plated at 5 × 104 cell/well in 24well plates and incubated with or without 1 nM DHT and
different concentrations of minoxidil for 2 to 6 d. Cell
growth was measured by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay as described
previously [29]. Briefly, at each time point, 50 µl of a 1
mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well containing
500 µl medium, and plates were incubated at 37°C for 3
h. After adding 500 µl of isopropyl alcohol to dissolve the
converted dye, the absorbance of each well was measured
at 570 and 650 nm using a DU 640B spectrophotometer
(Beckman, Fullerton, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Data in figures are means ± SD of at least
triplicate wells.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were performed as previously
described in detail [29] using anti-AR (1:250), anti-PSA
(1:500), and anti-β-actin (1:40,000) primary antibodies.

Protein stability and degradation

Statistical analysis

The effect of minoxidil on AR protein stability was
assessed by first seeding and incubating LNCaP cells for
24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with medium
containing 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide alone or with 10 nM
DHT or different concentrations of minoxidil, and plates
were incubated for different lengths of time. Thereafter,
cell lysates were analyzed for AR and β-actin by Western
blotting.

Data are expressed as means ± SEM. Differences
between two groups were assessed using an unpaired twotailed Student’s t-test.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay
SPR experiments were carried out on a Biacore
3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). All experiments were
performed at 25°C as described previously [30]. For
binding analysis, minoxidil was immobilized on a CM5
SPR biosensor chip (SA chip; GE Healthcare) at a flow
rate of 5 µl/min. Different concentrations of AR-LBD
protein were injected over the minoxidil-coated surfaces
at a flow rate of 40 l/min. Surfaces were regenerated by
injection of 0.02% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
and 1.0 M NaCl. Following subtraction of data from the
control flow cell to eliminate non-specific binding, all
curves were fitted by the numerical integration method
using BIA evaluation 3.2 software, as described in the BIA
evaluation handbook (GE Healthcare).

RT-PCR
RT-PCR was used to investigate the expression of
mRNA for the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel
subunits, Kir6.1 and SUR2B, in HHDPCs and cancer
cell lines. mRNA was converted to cDNA using the
avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcription
(RT) system (Promega, Madison, WI), as described by
the manufacturer. PCR amplification was performed
under standard conditions using Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the following primer
pairs: AR (M20132.1), 5’-CAG GAA TTC CTG TGC
ATG AAA GCA CTG C-3’ (forward) and 5’-TCA CTG
GGT GTG GAA ATA GAT GGG C-3’ (reverse); SUR2B
(NM_005691), 5’-GCT GAA GAA TAT GGT CAA ATC

TAC CAT GTC CTT CC-3’ (forward) and 5’-GTG AGC
CTG AGC TGT TTT CA-3’ (reverse). pSG5-AR served as
a positive control in AR studies, and HHDPCs served as a
positive control in KATP channel studies. The target bands
were sequenced and compared with published sequences
[31].
