Chemosensitivity in Drug-Resistant Pancreatic Cancer Cells

Abstract
Overcoming the inherent chemoresistance of pancreatic cancers remains a major goal of therapeutic investigations in this disease. In this study, we discovered a role for the human concentrative nucleoside transporter-1
(hCNT1; SLC28A1), a high-affinity pyrimidine nucleoside transporter, in determining the chemosensitivity of human
pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, the drug used presently as a standard of care. Compared with normal
pancreas and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, hCNT1 expression was frequently reduced in pancreatic tumors and
tumor cell lines. In addition, hCNT1-mediated 3H-gemcitabine transport was lower in pancreatic cancer cell lines
and correlated with cytotoxic IC50 estimations of gemcitabine. In contrast to gemcitabine-sensitive pancreatic
cancer cell lines, MIA PaCa-2, a gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line, exhibited relatively restrictive, cell
cycle-dependent hCNT1 expression and transport. hCNT1 translation was suppressed in the late G1-enriched MIA
PaCa-2 cell population possibly in an miRNA-dependent manner, which corresponded with the lowest hCNT1mediated gemcitabine transport during this phase. Although hCNT1 protein was induced during G1/S transition,
increased hCNT1 trafficking resulted in maximal cell surface recruitment and transport-overshoot in the G2/M
phase-enriched cell population. hCNT1 protein was directed predominantly to proteasomal or lysosomal degradation in S or G2/M phase MIA PaCa-2 cells, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition of hCNT1 degradation
moderately increased cell surface hCNT1 expression and cellular gemcitabine transport in MIA PaCa-2 cells.
Constitutive hCNT1 expression reduced clonogenic survival of MIA PaCa-2 cells and steeply augmented gemcitabine transport and chemosensitization. In addition to supporting a putative tumor suppressor role for hCNT1, our
findings identify hCNT1 as a potential candidate to render drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells amenable to
chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1825–35. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
20 ,20 -Difluoro-20 -deoxycytidine (dFdC; gemcitabine) is currently used as a first-line treatment against locally advanced
and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (1, 2). Gemcitabine is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active diphosphate (dFdC-DP) and triphosphate (dFdC-TP) forms that
inhibit DNA and RNA replication (3, 4, 5). In order for hydrophilic gemcitabine (log P ¼ 1.1 to -2.0) to enter cells,
membrane-bound nucleoside transporters are prerequisites
(as cells deficient in nucleoside transporter are resistant to
gemcitabine cytotoxicity (6)). Studies to date suggest 2 transporters from each of the human concentrative nucleoside
transporter family (hCNT1, hCNT3) and the equilibrative
nucleoside transporter family (hENT1, hENT2) are capable

of translocating gemcitabine across the cell surface (3, 6, 7–
10). Despite the expression of one or more of the aforementioned transporters in most cells types, hENT1 is generally
considered to be predominantly involved in gemcitabine transport in tumors as its expression correlates with cellular proliferation (8, 11). Clinical evidence also shows pancreatic tumor
cells with high hENT1 expression exhibiting increased gemcitabine chemosensitivity (6, 12–15).
Unlike hENT1, the roles of CNTs, especially hCNT1, in
governing gemcitabine cytotoxicity in tumors are not well
understood. hCNT1 is normally expressed at the apical surfaces of well-differentiated epithelial tissues such as intestinal
villi and hepatocytes (16, 17). hCNT1 mRNA and/or protein are
also detected in the pancreas, kidneys, skeletal muscles, uterus
corpus, salivary glands, and placenta (16, 18). Consistent with
hCNT1 expression in differentiated epithelial tissues, the rat
ortholog of hCNT1, rCNT1, is regulated by differentiationpromoting agents (19–23). Although the degree of tumor cell
differentiation often correlates with the clinical response to
chemotherapy, it is not clear whether the expression of hCNT1
itself is altered in tumors, and if so, whether such alterations
influence tumor cell proliferation and drug sensitization.
Earlier studies detected hCNT1 expression in solid (e.g.,
breast) tumors, predominantly localized in the cytoplasm
and nucleus (24). Evidence for the reduction or complete loss

of hCNT1 expression in solid (ovarian) tumors has also
surfaced, suggesting that alterations in hCNT1 expression
during tumor initiation/progression may have impacts on
nucleoside chemosensitivities (25).
hCNT1's precise involvements in pancreatic cancer cell
growth, proliferation, and differentiation have not been investigated and its role in determining gemcitabine sensitivity in
pancreatic cancer cells remains elusive. A previous study
showed that ectopic expression of hCNT1 cDNA into pancreatic cancer cells augmented gemcitabine influx and cytotoxicity, suggesting the importance of hCNT1 in improving
gemcitabine sensitivity in these cells (8). However, endogenous hCNT1 is found to be transiently expressed in subconfluent pancreatic cancer cells (8) further obscuring its
relationship to gemcitabine sensitivity. In this study, we
investigated the role of hCNT1 in pancreatic cancer cell
proliferation and gemcitabine chemosensitization in detail.

Real-time PCR analysis and 3H-gemcitabine transport
Nucleoside transport and real-time PCR analysis were
carried out as described previously (17).

Results
hCNT1 expression was frequently reduced in pancreatic
cancer
To test whether hCNT1 expression is altered in pancreatic
tumors, we quantitatively assessed hCNT1 mRNA and protein
levels by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively, in
5 pancreatic tumors and compared them with the matched
(i.e., derived from the same donors) adjacent normal pancreatic tissues. hCNT1 mRNA was significantly decreased in 4 out
of 5 tumor samples examined (Fig. 1A) with an average of 38.6
 4.2% (P < 0.001) expression in tumors. hCNT1 protein was
decreased (>2-fold) in 3 out of 5 samples tested (Supplementary Fig. 1). Next we assessed hCNT1 mRNA levels in normal
pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (HPDE) and in several human
pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan1, HpafII,
L3.6pl, MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, PL45, and SW1990). hCNT1
mRNA was decreased by 24- and 30-folds in all pancreatic
cancer cell lines (average) compared with HPDE cells and

normal pancreatic tissues (n ¼ 5), respectively (Fig. 1B). To
further investigate the functional relevance of hCNT1 expression reductions, we chose to examine hCNT1-mediated gemcitabine transport and cytotoxicity in detail in HPDE and 6
well-characterized pancreatic cancer cell lines. hCNT1mediated 3H-gemcitabine transport activity was significantly
reduced in all pancreatic cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 1C).
However, substantial relative hCNT1 transport activity was
still detected in exponentially growing BxPC-3, Capan-1, and
L3.6pl cell lines (0.1–0.9 pmol/mg/10 min) but not, or only
minimally, in AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1 cell lines (<0.1
pmol/mg/10 min) (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, significant correlations were established between hCNT1-mediated 3H-gemcitabine transport influxes, and gemcitabine cytotoxic IC50
values determined by conventional (r ¼ 0.82; P < 0.05;
Fig. 1D and 1F) and metronomic (r ¼ 0.92; P < 0.01;
Fig. 1E and 1F) dosing schedules. As hENT1 expression did
not change significantly during the gemcitabine treatments

(data not shown), the above data suggest hCNT1 transport as a
determinant of gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer.
Heterogeneities in hCNT1 protein localization in
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells
Despite similar levels of reduction in hCNT1 mRNA in all
pancreatic cancer cell lines examined, significant hCNT1mediated gemcitabine transport activities were only observed
in gemcitabine-sensitive cells (HPDE, L3.6pl, BxPC-3, PANC-1,
CaPan-1) and not gemcitabine-resistant cells (MIA PaCa-2,
AsPC-1). To further investigate this discrepancy, we examined
hCNT1 protein in these cell lines by Western blotting (Fig. 2A).
hCNT1 protein was detected in all cell lines as 2 bands (70
kDa), most likely corresponding to its glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms (26). Although the relative abundance of
these 2 forms varied between cell lines (Fig. 2A), the total
hCNT1 protein levels (glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms)
were not significantly different between gemcitabine-sensitive

and gemcitabine-resistant cancer cell lines and did not account
for the differences observed in hCNT1 transport activities
between these groups. These results prompted an investigation
as to whether aberrant cellular localization or lack of cell
surface targeting of hCNT1 protein resulted in inadequate
gemcitabine transport/cytotoxicity in gemcitabine-resistant
cancer cells. Interestingly, immunocytochemical analyses displayed hCNT1 protein at appreciable levels in the cell periphery
of most L3.6pl and BxPC-3 (gemcitabine-sensitive) cells
(Fig. 2B, arrows), while only a small fraction of MIA PaCa-2
(gemcitabine-resistant) cells alone displayed hCNT1 expression (Fig. 2C, top row). In addition, hCNT1-staining patterns in
MIA PaCa-2 cells varied extensively with culture conditions
and cell densities. Furthermore, hCNT1 immunoreactivity in
MIA PaCa-2 cells was mainly intracytoplasmic (Fig. 2C, arrowheads) with only a subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct
hCNT1 cell surface expression (Fig. 2C, arrows). The observed
heterogeneities in hCNT1 staining (Fig. 2C, insets) suggest that
intricate cell-cycle regulation was influencing hCNT1 transport
characteristics in drug-resistant MIA PaCa-2 cells.
To further investigate cell-cycle control of hCNT1 in MIA
PaCa-2 cells, we utilized serum synchronization experiments
(Fig. 3A, 3B, and Supplemental Table 1) to study alterations in
hCNT1-mediated 3H-gemcitabine transport during the cell
cycle. Transport studies conducted in parallel-synchronized
MIA PaCa-2 cell populations identified that hCNT1 contribution toward total gemcitabine cellular uptake was very low in
the G1 phase (Fig. 3C; labeled SFM; Supplemental Table I).
hCNT1 transport contributions significantly increased from
3 hour of serum recovery in S phase-predominated cell

populations (Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table I). Despite hCNT1's
implications as an S phase-inducible protein (27), the maximal
hCNT1-mediated gemcitabine transport was not observed in
the S phase-predominated cell population (3–9 h; 0.25–0.3
pmol/mg*10 min) but was observed in the G2/M phasepredominated cell population (12–15 h; 0.4–0.7 pmol/
mg*10min) (Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table I). Unlike hCNT1,
significant proportions (30–40%) of total gemcitabine transport into G1 and S phase-enriched cell populations were
mediated by hENT1 (Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table I). Compared
with MIA PaCa-2 cells, hCNT1-mediated gemcitabine transport levels in G1, S, and G2/M phases of a gemcitabinesensitive cell line (BxPC-3) were significantly higher at each
of the corresponding phases (data not shown). These results
suggest a cell cycle-dependent, restrictive role of hCNT1 in
impeding gemcitabine transport in drug-resistant MIA PaCa-2
cells.
Increased trafficking of hCNT1 protein to the cell
surface resulted in gemcitabine transport-overshoot in
G2/M MIA PaCa-2 cells
We next investigated whether the cell cycle-restricted
hCNT1 transport activity could be explained by alterations
in hCNT1 mRNA and protein accompanying the cell cycle.
Real-time PCR analysis indicated that unlike hENT1 mRNA,
hCNT1 mRNA levels in G1-, S- and G2/M-enriched MIA PaCa2 cell populations were not too different (within a 2-fold range;
Supplemental Fig. 2) and did not account for the greater than
6-fold increase in hCNT1 transport activity noted between G1
and G2/M cells. Conversely, Western blotting analysis showed

predominated and continued to 12–18 hour of serum recovery
where G2/M cells predominated (Fig. 4A). However, a steep
increase in hCNT1-mediated gemcitabine transport was only
noticed at approximately 15 hour of serum recovery (Fig 3C).
Such a temporal difference between hCNT1 protein expression and transport activity is possible if the spatial localization
of hCNT1 protein varied and if the accrual of hCNT1 protein at
the cell surface ensued later-to-early S phase. To test this, we
conducted biotinylation of cell surface proteins in synchronized MIA PaCa-2 cell populations, and the cell surface pools
of proteins were isolated by avidin pull-down assays (see
"Methods"). Western blotting analysis on hCNT1 immunopre-

protein at the cell surface between approximately12–18 hour
of serum recovery (Fig. 4A), which corresponded to the
preponderance of G2/M cells. Furthermore, densitometry
analysis of total and cell surface hCNT1 protein levels indicated the ratio of cell surface to total hCNT1 fraction (normalized to b-actin input) was approximately 3–4 folds higher in
G2/M-enriched cells compared with S phase cells (Fig. 4A).
These data identify that increased cell surface accumulation of
hCNT1 in the G2/M phase resulting in gemcitabine transportovershoot at this phase.
To corroborate the data, we carried out immunocytochemical analysis on various serum synchronized MIA PaCa-2 cell
populations (Fig. 4B). hCNT1 immunoreactivity was drastically diminished in the G1-enriched MIA PaCa-2 cell population, with only occasional dots noticed at the periphery of

beginning at 3 hour of serum recovery in MIA PaCa-2 cells
and was predominantly intracytoplasmic at time points 3–9
hour and 21–24 hour (Fig. 4B). Cell surface hCNT1 staining
was readily detected in 12–18 hour serum-recovered cells
(Fig. 4B) with maximal cell surface hCNT1 staining identified
at the 15 hour time point (Fig. 4B). The increase in hCNT1 cell
surface staining was accompanied by a decrease in hCNT1
cytoplasmic staining, and hCNT1 staining frequently appeared
as a "string of beads" at the cell surface, consistent with the
docking of hCNT1-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). In contrast to hCNT1, hENT1 was abundantly
expressed in G1-enriched MIA PaCa-2 cells at cell contacts
(Fig. 4B). Also, hENT1 was detected at the cell surface at 3–9
hour and 21–24 hour time points (Fig. 4B) when hCNT1 was
predominantly intracellular. Interestingly, hENT1 staining at
the cell surface diminished when hCNT1 staining at the cell
surface increased at G2/M-enriched cells (Fig. 4B). These data

Since an earlier study had shown that serum deprivation
can influence hCNT1 levels (27), we alternatively validated
hCNT1 expressional variations in MIA PaCa-2 cells separated
into G1, S, and G2/M phases by flow cytometry. To study
expression of hCNT1 at each of the designated phases, these
flow-sorted cellular subpopulations were allowed only brief
periods (30 min) of attachment to a substratum as drop
cultures, followed by immunocytochemical analysis. The
results obtained (Fig. 4C) essentially reproduced hCNT1
staining patterns obtained from the serum synchronization
experiments. Mitotic cells, as judged from cells containing
DAPI-stained, condensed chromatids, exhibited low cytoplasmic hCNT1 staining (Fig 4C, arrowhead). However, the cells
that seemed to progress to mitotic completion (after nuclear
division) began to express hCNT1 at the cell surface, suggest-

ing reappearance in early G1. To further confirm the latter
findings, we arrested MIA PaCa-2 cells in mitosis by treating
with 10 mm (24 h) colchicine, a mitotic inhibitor, and then
examined hCNT1 immunoreactivities as the cells progressed
to G1 in the absence of the inhibitor. As observed in the flowsorted cells, mitosis-arrested cells exhibited very low to some
cytoplasmic hCNT1 staining (Supplemental Fig. 3, first and
second panel), but hCNT1 was transiently observed at the cell
surface in early G1 (1–2 h after inhibitor recovery; Supplemental Fig. 3, third and fourth panels) but not at late G1 cells (4
h after inhibitor recovery; Supplemental Fig. 3, fifth panel).
These results identify a brief continuum of hCNT1 cell surface
expression after mitosis (early G1) with a rapid loss of hCNT1
expression in late G1.

pathways: miRNAs-122, 214, 339–3p, and 650
suppressed hCNT1 protein expression
The presence of steady levels of hCNT1 mRNA with varying
levels of hCNT1 protein in the cell cycle suggest that alterations in hCNT1 protein synthesis or degradation controlled
hCNT1 activity in MIA PaCa-2 cells. In order to test between
these possibilities, we first inhibited the cellular protein
degradation machineries using pharmacological inhibitors
and assessed the level of hCNT1 protein accumulation at
different phases of cell cycle. Pretreatment of late-G1 arrested
cells with MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) or leupeptin
(a lysosome inhibitor) did not significantly increase hCNT1
protein levels (Fig. 5A). Unlike in late G1 cells, hCNT1 protein

increased 3H-gemcitabine transport by approximately 2- and
approximately1.8-folds in S and G2/M-phase cells, respectively
(Fig. 5C).
Although no reduction in hCNT1 mRNA was noticed in G1
MIA PaCa-2 cells, hCNT1 protein was almost undetectable.
Furthermore, the inhibition of protein degradation machineries did not increase hCNT1 protein, suggesting that a lack
of translation and not accelerated degradation as the cause for
hCNT1 loss in G1. Since recent evidence show that microRNAs
(miRNAs) can regulate diverse cellular processes by binding to
the 30 UTR of target mRNAs and inhibiting their translation
(28, 29), we next investigated miRNA-mediated regulation of
hCNT1 in G1 cells. Expression profiling of 754 miRNAs in MIA
PaCa-2 cells identified a >2-fold decrease in 145 miRNAs in

was predominantly directed to proteasomal degradation in S
phase-enriched cells, as judged by increased accumulation of
hCNT1 protein only after MG132 treatment but not with
leupeptin treatment (Fig. 5A). hCNT1 in G2/M-enriched
MIA PaCa-2 cells exhibited partial sensitivities to both
MG132 and leupeptin treatments (Fig. 5A). Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that proteasome inhibition in S
and G2/M phase cells and lysosome inhibition by leupeptin in
G2/M cells not only increased hCNT1 cellular staining but also
appeared to augment the cell surface and nuclear expressions
of hCNT1 (Fig. 5B). As a result, we tested whether MG132 and
leupeptin could increase hCNT1 function and improve

cells. Our data showed that MG132 and leupeptin marginally

hCNT1, Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation, and Chemosensitivity

G2/M-enriched cells compared with G1-enriched cells (Supplemental File 1), out of which 7 predicted hCNT1-modulating
miRNAs (miR-122, miR-214, miR-218–2*, miR-220b, miR-330–
5p, miR-339–3p, and miR-650; Fig 5D; asterisks) (Supplemental
Table 2) were decreased by more than 10 folds. Overexpression
by lentiviral gene transfer of selective miRNAs identified
miRNA-122, miRNA-214, miRNA-339–3p, and miRNA-650 to
significantly reduce hCNT1 protein levels (Fig. 5E; Supplemental Table 3) without significantly altering hCNT1 and hENT1
mRNA levels in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Supplemental Fig. 4). In
addition, these miRNAs did not significantly alter hENT1
protein levels in MIA PaCa-2 cells (data not shown). Subsequent functional analyses in L3.6pl cells identified 4 miRNAs
(miR-122, miR-214, miR-339–3p, and miR-650) to significantly
reduce both hCNT1 transport activity and gemcitabine cytotoxicity, except for miR-339–3p which did not alter gemcitabine cytotoxicity (Supplemental Fig. 5). In MIA PaCa-2 cells,
despite all 4 miRNAs decreasing hCNT1 transport activity,
only miR-122 also moderately decreased gemcitabine cytotoxicity (Supplemental Fig. 5). Together, these data suggest
that miRNA-mediated control of gemcitabine chemosensitivity is governed by complex, cell line-dependent mechanisms
most likely involving both the endogenous functional levels of
hCNT1 as well as the other diverse targets of the respective
miRNAs.
Retroviral expression of hCNT1 cDNA lacking 30 UTR in
MIA PaCa-2 cells resulted in constitutive hCNT1
expression, reduced MIA PaCa-2 clonogenicity, and
augmented gemcitabine chemosensitization
As hCNT1 expression is reduced in pancreatic cancer, we
next assessed whether hCNT1 overexpression could alter the
growth characteristics of the MIA PaCa-2 cell line in the
absence of gemcitabine. Retroviral gene transfer of the hCNT1
coding sequence alone (without 50 and 30 UTRs) tagged to the
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Supplemental Fig. 6) substantially reduced colony forming abilities in MIA PaCa-2 and
PANC-1 (gemcitabine-resistant), L3.6pl (gemcitabine-sensitive), OV90 (ovarian carcinoma), and MDCK (noncancerous
canine kidney cell line) cell lines (Fig. 6B). The cell lines with
lower endogenous hCNT1 activities (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1)
exhibited somewhat higher decreases in clonogenic survival
(>60% and >90% reductions, respectively) than the L3.6pl cell
line (<50% reduction), which possesses a relatively higher
endogenous hCNT1 activity. Ectopic hCNT1HA in MIA
PaCa-2 and L3.6pl clones displayed a constitutive, high hCNT1
expression at both the cell surface and intracytoplasmic
vesicular structures (Fig. 6C) and steeply augmented 3Hgemcitabine transport (Fig. 6D) and chemosensitization
(Fig. 6E).

Discussion
We provide primal evidence for the frequent downregulation of hCNT1 expression in human pancreatic tumors and
that the hCNT1-mediated gemcitabine transport levels correlate with gemcitabine cytotoxicity. More importantly, our
studies show that restrictive, cell cycle-dependent expression

www.aacrjournals.org

and degradation characteristics of hCNT1 act as limiting
factors for a sustained and concentrative uptake of gemcitabine in drug-resistant pancreatic cancer. Our data identify
novel mechanisms for nucleoside drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells and suggest modulation of hCNT1 expression
(by proteasomal inhibitors, selective miRNA antagonists, or
direct hCNT1 gene transfer) as a promising approach for
improving nucleoside drug sensitivity in pancreatic cancer.
In addition, our data support hCNT1 as a putative tumor
suppressor in pancreatic cancer.
Several lines of investigation show gemcitabine and other
nucleoside-derived anticancer drugs causing cessation of
tumor cell proliferation at the S phase of the cell cycle (30–
34). Consistent with augmented responses at S phase, experimental evidence shows parallel inductions of hCNT1 (27) and
deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (35, 36), a transporter and metabolic enzyme involved in the first and key rate-limiting
gemcitabine cellular activation steps, respectively. Although
our findings lend credence to hCNT1 protein being induced
during S phase, maximal magnitudes of hCNT1 cell surface
expression and functional activity are not seen until the G2/M
phase. Additionally, S phase MIA PaCa-2 cells mainly exhibit
intracytoplasmic hCNT1 staining with an extended time lag
between hCNT1 synthesis and hCNT1 cell surface accrual. A
previous report on bone marrow leukemia cells shows the
number of nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites (a measure of
ENT1 expression) to be significantly increased during S phase
(37). In agreement with those observations, we observed
significant cell surface hENT1 immunoreactivity and Naþindependent hENT1–mediated gemcitabine uptake in both G1
and S phases of MIA PaCa-2 cells. While these data seem
consistent with the involvement of ENTs in S-phase arrest of
solid tumor cells, time-course studies from other laboratories
have shown that metabolic conversion of gemcitabine to
gemcitabine triphosphate within cells peaked at 12 hour
(32), with a permanent block of cells in S phase noticed at
approximately16 hour post gemcitabine treatment (38). As G1
extends for approximately10 hour and S phase extends for
approximately 5–6 hour (both totaling approximately15–16 h)
in many cell types, hCNT1 transport-overshoot at the G2/M
phase could play a key role in forcing gemcitabine-treated
tumor cells to S phase arrest. In this regard, hCNT1 transport
overshoot at the G2/M phase was also observed in gemcitabine-sensitive pancreatic cancer cells and in other solid tumor
cell lines (e.g., ovarian tumor cells; personal communications)
in which gemcitabine induces S phase arrests.
To further acquire mechanistic insights into restricted
hCNT1 expression in drug-resistant MIA PaCa-2 cells, we
investigated the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational (e.g., protein degradation) control of hCNT1 during
the cell cycle. Our screen identified miRNAs 122, 214, 339–3p,
and 650 to decrease hCNT1 protein expression with their
levels cycling between G1 and S/G2/M phases to influence
hCNT1 transport levels at these phases. Additionally,
increased trafficking of hCNT1 protein to the cell surface
facilitated the selective gemcitabine transport-overshoot in
G2/M cells. hCNT1 was subjected to both proteasomal and
lysosomal degradation. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibi-

tion of hCNT1 degradation not only increased hCNT1 cellular
levels but also significantly increased cell surface hCNT1
expression and 3H-gemcitabine cellular influxes (in S and
G2/M phases). As several proteasomal inhibitors are now
being evaluated as anticancer agents (39, 40), the current
results suggest that combination drug regimens of these
inhibitors and gemcitabine are likely to bring enhanced
cytotoxicity to drug-resistant pancreatic cancer.
This study identified diminution of hCNT1 expression,
possibly at multiple levels, in pancreatic cancer. hCNT1
expression was frequently diminished in pancreatic tumors,
and restriction of hCNT1 activity to specific phases of the cell
cycle further limited gemcitabine transport in drug-resistant
MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Unlike in MIA PaCa-2
cells, hCNT1 expression is continuously observed at the cell
periphery of gemcitabine-sensitive L3.6pl and BxPC-3 cells. In
this regard, the latter cell lines exhibit well-differentiated,
epithelial characteristics (41) with high levels of epithelial
markers (e.g., E-cadherin) expression (42–44), whereas MIA
PaCa-2 cells show poorly differentiated characteristics (41)
with a mesenchymal morphology (45) and express mesenchymal markers (e.g., vimentin, ZEB1) (42, 46). As our categorization of pancreatic cancer cell lines, based on hCNT1
transport and gemcitabine sensitivity, to some extent reflect
the differentiation state of these pancreatic cancer cells, the
observed hCNT1 heterogeneities are a likely representation of
the tumor dedifferentiation events in vivo and may not be
mere artifacts of the cellular transformation process. Our data
also identify reduction in the proliferative capacity of pancreatic cancerous cells upon constitutive expression of
hCNT1. Although hCNT1 was widely characterized for its

transport properties, it is not yet clear whether non-transport
related cellular functions are involved in its growth suppressive properties. We believe that hCNT1 brings growth control
by inducing differentiation (or reverting dedifferentiation) in
pancreatic tumor cells. This hypothesis is based on earlier
investigations (19, 21, 22), including our own studies (16, 17),
supporting hCNT1's association with cellular differentiation.
In addition, we found that unlike the control MIA PaCa-2
clones that were larger and irregular with corrugated edges,
hCNT1-expressing MIA PaCa-2 clones were relatively smaller
and compact with differentiated epithelial characteristics
(Fig. 6A). Moreover, the ability to induce differentiation might
be sufficient enough to promote growth control in pancreatic
cancer as prodifferentiation activity has been shown to act as
a tumor suppressor mechanism (47, 48). Overall, our data
support that hCNT1's involvement in cellular transport, proliferation, and differentiation could synergistically impact
tumor growth control in drug-resistant pancreatic cancer.
