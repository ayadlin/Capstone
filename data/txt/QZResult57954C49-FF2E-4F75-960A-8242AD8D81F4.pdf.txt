Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a neural crest-derived embryonal malignancy, which accounts for 13% of all pediatric cancer
mortality, primarily due to tumor recurrence. Therapy-resistant cancer stem cells are implicated in tumor relapse,
but deﬁnitive phenotypic evidence of the existence of these cells has been lacking. In this study, we deﬁne a
highly tumorigenic subpopulation in neuroblastoma with stem cell characteristics, based on the expression of
CSF3R, which encodes the receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF receptor positive
(aka G-CSFrþ or CD114þ) cells isolated from a primary tumor and the NGP cell line by ﬂow cytometry were highly
tumorigenic and capable of both self-renewal and differentiation to progeny cells. CD114þ cells closely resembled
embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells with respect to their proﬁles of cell cycle, miRNA, and gene
expression. In addition, they reﬂect a primitive undifferentiated neuroectodermal/neural crest phenotype
revealing a developmental hierarchy within neuroblastoma tumors. We detected this dedifferentiated neural
crest subpopulation in all established neuroblastoma cell lines, xenograft tumors, and primary tumor specimens
analyzed. Ligand activation of CD114 by the addition of exogenous G-CSF to CD114þ cells conﬁrmed intact STAT3
upregulation, characteristic of G-CSF receptor signaling. Together, our data describe a novel distinct subpopulation within neuroblastoma with enhanced tumorigenicity and a stem cell–like phenotype, further elucidating
the complex heterogeneity of solid tumors such as neuroblastoma. We propose that this subpopulation may
represent an additional target for novel therapeutic approaches to this aggressive pediatric malignancy. Cancer

malignancy of childhood and accounts for 13% of all pediatric
cancer deaths (1). Currently, overall survival is less than 50%,
and treatment consists of dose-intensive chemotherapy, which
confers major long-term side effects in many of these young
survivors (2). As in adult cancers, the vast majority of deaths are
due to relapsed, drug-resistant metastatic disease that may be
driven by cancer stem cells (CSC).
CSCs have been deﬁned as a multipotent subpopulation of
cells within a tumor with the ability to self-renew, generate
differentiated progeny, and recapitulate a heterogeneous cancer population (3, 4). In breast and colon cancer, multiple
studies have shown highly tumorigenic subpopulations within
these tumors with enhanced tumorigenicity, resistance to
chemotherapy, and the ability to establish metastatic foci in
distant microenvironments (5, 6). Thus, most solid tumors
likely represent heterogeneous populations of cells in various
states of differentiation and with varying levels of tumorigenicity and chemosensitivity.
The translational potential of speciﬁcally targeting such
chemoresistant and tumorigenic subpopulations has motivated a number of studies in neuroblastoma. These have included
analyses of side population cells, a classic method used to
isolate hematopoietic stem cells based on the efﬁcient efﬂux of
Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst) dye from stem cells (7), neurosphere

Deﬁning Tumorigenic Cells in Neuroblastoma

assays (nonadherent, serum-free conditions; ref. 8), and puriﬁcation of neuroblastoma subpopulations based on surface
markers associated with stem cell populations in other types of
malignancies (9, 10). These previous approaches have generated important data about the drug resistance and cytokine
responsiveness of neuroblastoma, and in some cases have
deﬁned in vitro conditions that enrich for tumorigenic populations. However, these studies have all relied on extensive ex vivo
cell culture of biopsy material or cell lines, which is well known
to extensively modify gene expression proﬁles (11) and have
not consistently identiﬁed discrete subpopulations within
primary neuroblastoma with enhanced tumorigenicity or
self-renewal characteristics.
Neuroblastoma seems to arise within peripheral sympathetic ganglia throughout the body, including approximately 30%
of cases that develop within the adrenal medulla (1, 12). The
neural crest is a transient cell population originating from
peripheral neuroectoderm of the dorsal tube, which further
differentiates, delaminates, and migrates to form multiple
structures, including the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. Neuroblastoma expresses GD2, Nestin, S100, and other markers of
sympathetic neural crest lineage (13). Transgenic mice with
MYCN expression targeted to neural crest (TH-MYCN mice)
develop a high-grade malignancy, which closely models many
aspects of human neuroblastoma including the presence of
embryonic rests of crest-like precursors within peripheral
ganglia (14). Thus, both clinical and experimental models
deﬁne neuroblastoma as a malignancy of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system linked to defective neural crest
maturation.
A critical transcription factor controlling neural crest speciﬁcation is STAT3; loss-of-function of STAT3 promotes apoptosis and loss of neural crest markers (e.g., SOX10 and snail2),
whereas increased function promotes the maintenance of an
undifferentiated early neural crest phenotype (15). STAT3
signaling has been found to be important for the maintenance
of CSC-like subpopulations in several other malignancies, such
as invasive bladder cancer (16), colon cancers (17), hepatocellular carcinoma (18), and malignant gliomas (19). Transcriptional activation of STAT3 is a downstream consequence of
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–mediated activation of the G-CSF receptor, typically found on granulocyte
precursors. The receptor for G-CSF promotes neurogenesis
and is found on a number of neuronal and neural crest-derived
cell types (20, 21). In addition, G-CSF signaling through the
G-CSF receptor (aka CD114 encoded by CSF3R) promotes the
survival and expansion of adult neural stem cells (21), has
neurotrophic effects, and may promote regeneration of neural
tissue after stroke (22). Expression of the receptor and this
signaling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple
tumor types including ovarian (23), bladder (24), and squamous cell cancers (25). We thus hypothesized that surface
expression of CD114 may distinguish a subpopulation of
neuroblastoma with increased STAT3 responsiveness, which
could promote an undifferentiated phenotype similar to that
found in early multipotent neural crest precursors.
To test this hypothesis, we used ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) to detect and isolate CD114-positive

(CD114þ) cells in both clinical and experimental neuroblastoma tumor specimens. Of the human and mouse neuroblastoma cell lines, tumor xenografts, and primary clinical
tumor samples tested, we detected a distinct subpopulation
of CD114þ cells in all specimens, as well as in de novo tumors
arising from TH-MYCN transgenic mice. Analysis of CD114þ
subpopulations conﬁrmed activation of STAT3 signaling in
response to exogenous G-CSF. Subsequent characterization
of this subpopulation, using in vivo limiting dilution and
competitive lineage-tracing studies, showed that CD114þ
cells are highly tumorigenic, self-renew, and give rise to
more differentiated progeny. Within the normal developmental hierarchy of neural crest, genetic analysis shows
CD114þ cells are similar to (premigratory) neural crest cells,
whereas the CD114-negative (CD114) population represents a later stage of neural crest differentiation (migratory
crest). On the basis of the differential expression of CD114,
these studies deﬁne a novel dedifferentiated subpopulation
within neuroblastoma and provide further evidence that
heterogeneous subpopulations within solid tumors differentially contribute to tumorigenicity.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and sources of lines
Human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32, and HEK293T cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The
neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y/luc and NGP/luc were provided by Drs. J. Kandel and D. Yamashiro (Columbia University,
New York, NY); CHLA-255/luc, SK-N-BE(2), and LA-N-5 were a
gift of Dr. L. Metelitsa (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,
TX), SK-N-JF and SHEP provided by Dr. M. Brenner (Baylor
College of Medicine), and NB-1691 a gift of Dr. J. Khan [National
Cancer Institute (NCI), Gaithersburg, MD]. Brieﬂy, cell lines
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(HEK293T), RPMI-1640 medium [IMR-32, LA-N-5, SH-SY5Y/
luc, NGP/luc, SK-N-BE(2), NB-1691, SKN-JF, and SHEP], or
Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM; CHLA-255/luc).
All media was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS,
2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin, with the exception of CHLA-255, which was
supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS.
All cell lines have been validated by genotyping within the
past 12 months. In addition, neuroblastoma origin of all lines
has been conﬁrmed by expression of CD56, Nestin, MYCN, and
tyrosine hydroxylase.
All cell lines used in this article were routinely tested for
Mycoplasma on a monthly basis.
Tissue culture of transgenic mouse tumors
Tumors resected from TH-MYCNþ/þ mice were resected
under sterile conditions. Tissue was minced, washed in cold
PBS, treated with collagenase for 1 hour, and ﬁltered through a
70-mm cell ﬁlter. Cells where then placed in 500 mL of complete
IMDM media (20% FBS, 2-mm b-mercaptoethanol, 2% HEPES,
2% Na-pyruvate, and 1 nonessential amino acids). After 4
days, adherent cells were trypsinized and sorted for neuroblastoma-speciﬁc markers (GD2 and CD24) and analyzed or

replaced in culture. MYCN protein expression was conﬁrmed
by Western blot analysis in all mouse tumor materials.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Flow cytometry was conducted on an LSR II 5-laser ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). FACS was conducted on a DAKO
Cytomation MoFlo 9-color cell sorter. BD FACSDiva v6.1.2 (BD
Biosciences) was used to analyze ﬂow data and Summit v4.3
(Cytomation) software was used to analyze FACS data. All
clinical specimens were obtained under protocol approved by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Baylor College of
Medicine (IRB protocol H-26515). A description of antibodies
and techniques are found in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
In vivo tumorigenicity assay
Four- to 6-week-old female nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice (NCI-Frederick,
Frederick, MD) were used for all xenograft studies and cared
for in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine (IACUC
protocol AN-4810, AN-3705). Using our previously described
orthotopic kidney capsule model (orthotopic model) of neuroblastoma, an inoculum of sorted CD114þ or CD114 NGP
cells in 0.1 mL of PBS was injected under the renal capsule (26).
Three experiments were carried out with decreasing numbers
of implanted neuroblastoma cells: 1,000 cells per mouse
(CD114þ, n ¼ 5; CD114, n ¼ 5), 100 cells per mouse (CD114þ,
n ¼ 10; CD114, n ¼ 10), 10 cells per mouse (CD114þ, n ¼ 10;
CD114, n ¼ 10). Starting 3 weeks after tumor cell implantation, all mice were monitored weekly by bioluminescent imaging for development of tumor formation (Xenogen IVIS 100
System; Caliper Life Sciences).
In vivo lineage-tracing studies
GFPþ/CD114þ and GFP/CD114 cells (NGP cell line) or
tdTomatoþ/CD114þ and GFPþ/CD114 cells (NB-1691 cell
line) were sorted and mixed in a 1:1 ratio. An inoculum of
1,000 cells (500 CD114þ cells/500 CD114 cells) in 0.1 mL of
PBS was injected under the renal capsule of 4- to 6-week-old
female NOD/SCID mice (NGP line, n ¼ 5; NB-1691 line, n ¼ 6).
All mice were sacriﬁced at 12 weeks and underwent complete
necropsy examination, and xenografts underwent histologic
conﬁrmation. The endpoints evaluated were the percentage
tumor take (i.e., the percentage of animals that developed
primary tumors) and tumor latency (i.e., the time from tumor
cell injection to detection via bioluminescent imaging). For the
lineage-tracing experiments carried out with the NGP cell line,
anti-CD-56-APC was used to identify neuroblastoma cells.
In vivo chemotherapy assay
In vivo experiments were carried out in 4- to 6-week-old
female nude mice (athymic NCr-nu/nu; NCI-Frederick). Mice
were housed in pathogen-free conditions and cared for in
accordance with the IACUC of Baylor College of Medicine
(IACUC protocol AN-4810). Using an orthotopic model of
neuroblastoma, 15 mice were implanted with an inoculum of
1 million unsorted NGP neuroblastoma cells in 0.1 mL of PBS

under the renal capsule (26). Three weeks after tumor cell
implantation and engraftment, xenograft tumors were conﬁrmed by bioluminescent imaging and subsequently monitored weekly (Xenogen IVIS 100 System; Caliper Life Sciences).
The mice were then randomized into 3 treatment groups:
control (n ¼ 3), VP-16 (n ¼ 6), and Cytoxan (n ¼ 6). Control
mice were injected with vehicle (PBS) intraperitoneally on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for 3 consecutive weeks.
VP-16 group (etoposide, 9 mg/kg/dose the ﬁrst week and then
12 mg/kg/dose the next 2 weeks; Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for 3 consecutive weeks. The Cytoxan group (cyclophosphamide, 7.5
mg/kg/dose the ﬁrst week and then 15 mg/kg/dose the next 2
weeks; Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally on Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday for 3 consecutive weeks. At the end
of 6 weeks, mice from each group were sacriﬁced over the
course of 6 days to accommodate ﬂow analysis of the 15
xenograft tumors. Xenograft tumors were resected, weighed,
and processed for ﬂow cytometry to assess CD114 population
in each tumor of each treatment group. The percentage
CD114þ population of each tumor was pooled into each
treatment group and compared using Kruskal–Wallis method.
Stat3 reporter assay
The lentiviral Stat3 activation reporter used in the present
study has an eGFP gene cloned downstream of a M67-responsive promoter, which contains 4 M67-binding motifs
(TTCCCGTAA) and a TATA box (kindly provided by Dr.
Michael T. Lewis, Baylor College of Medicine). Stat3.eGFP
reporter-transduced neuroblastoma cells were harvested and
0.5  106 cells were either untreated or treated with 10 or 100
ng/mL of G-CSF (Neupogen; Amgen Inc.) in combination with
0, 3, and 10 mmol/L Stattic (Calbiochem, EMD Millipore) and
then ﬁxed at different time points (1% paraformaldehyde) and
then stained and analyzed for CD114 and GFP expression by
ﬂow cytometry (full description of assay in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods).
Statistical analysis
In vivo studies are expressed as mean  SD. All in vitro
assays, including ﬂow-cytometric analyses, cell-cycle analyses,
and Stat3 reporter assays, are expressed as mean  SD, and all
were conducted in triplicate. Data were compared using
Student t test. Incidence of xenograft tumor formation was
calculated with Fisher exact test. All animal and human data
were compared using Kruskal–Wallis test.
Additional Supplementary Materials and Methods are
included in the Supplementary Data.

Results
CD114þ cells are highly tumorigenic, can self-renew, and
generate differentiated progeny tumor cells
Initially, we used phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for ﬂow cytometry to assess the expression of
CD114 in neuroblastoma cell lines (Fig. 1A–C). We consistently
detect a small population of CD114þ cells (range, 0.2%–1.0%)
in every neuroblastoma cell line examined regardless of

Deﬁning Tumorigenic Cells in Neuroblastoma

phenotype (S or N type) or MYCN status (Fig. 1C). A distinct
CD114þ subpopulation is also found in every primary human
biopsy specimen obtained at initial diagnosis and in murine
short-term culture cell lines derived from de novo neuroblastoma tumors arising in TH-MYCN transgenic mice (Fig. 1B
and Table 1). We conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of our analyses
with competitive ligand-binding studies using PE-conjugated
G-CSF. The positively stained subpopulation detected by
ﬂow cytometry binds speciﬁcally to G-CSF–PE conjugate,
which is competitively inhibited by nonconjugated G-CSF
ligand or blocked by antireceptor antibodies in both murine
and human neuroblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B).
When placed in tissue culture, FACS-puriﬁed CD114þ cells
rapidly differentiate, generating a mixed population of CD114
cells with a small percentage (0.2%–1%) maintaining CD114þ
expression. Despite this technical limitation, we used the
following molecular, ﬂow-cytometric, and in vivo xenograft
studies to characterize the distinct phenotype of CD114þ
subpopulations in neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors.
An orthotopic xenograft model was used to compare the
in vivo tumorigenicity of FACS-sorted CD114þ and CD114
subpopulations (26). In vivo limiting dilution analysis was
conducted using binomial generalized linear modeling with
the complementary log–log link (Fig. 1D; refs. 27, 28). After
verifying goodness of ﬁt to the Single Hit Poisson Model
assumption (P > 0.15), CD114þ cells were more than 10-fold
tumorigenic than CD114 cells (P ¼ 0.008), with the calculated
tumor-initiating cell fraction of 1 in 583 for CD114þ cells and
more than 1 in 6,050 for CD114 cells. We were able to generate
tumors from as few as 10 CD114þ implanted cells (Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, FACS analysis of the resulting xenograft tumors,
which were generated from highly puriﬁed CD114þ cells (>99%
CD114þ cells), show a return to a baseline percentage of
CD114þ cells as observed in the unsorted, parental cell line
(0.2%–1.0%; Fig. 1E). This is similar to what is observed during
attempts to culture CD114þ cells. Although tumors primarily
arose from CD114þ cells at limiting cell numbers (<100 cells),
one xenograft tumor resulted from injection of 100 CD114
cells (Fig. 1D; one tumor out of a total of 25 CD114 cell
injections). However, analysis of this tumor again showed a
small CD114þ subpopulation (<1%) suggesting that either
CD114 cells dedifferentiated into CD114þ cells or contaminating CD114þ cell(s) was present in the negatively selected
CD114 population injected.
We next conducted competitive lineage-tracing studies in
mice by coimplanting mixtures of FACS-puriﬁed subsets of
50% CD114þ and 50% CD114 cells, differentially tagged with
ﬂuorescent markers. In 2 neuroblastoma cell lines (NGP and
NB-1691), the resulting xenografts uniformly and exclusively
contained the ﬂuorescent tag derived from the CD114þ subset
(Fig. 1F and G). Furthermore, ﬂow cytometry of the xenograft
tumors shows that the percentage of CD114þ neuroblastoma
cells again returned to levels found in the parental, unsorted
cell line (0.2%–1.0%; Fig. 1F and G and Supplementary Table
S1). Similar to the limiting dilution study, we discovered one
exception of a single tumor (1 of 7) generated from the mixture
of RFPþ/CD114þ and GFPþ/CD114 cells from the NB-1691

www.aacrjournals.org

cell line. In this case, a small discrete focus of GFPþ tumor was
found abutting a large, uniformly RFPþ tumor. Flow cytometry
of the GFPþ population again showed a small GFPþ/CD114þ
subpopulation (data not shown).
Although the in vivo limiting dilution study and the in vivo
lineage-tracing study show a clear propensity and marked
tumorigencity of the CD114þ subpopulation, we identiﬁed
tumors that were derived from the CD114 subpopulation
yet recapitulated a small CD114þ subpopulation. Two possibilities may explain for this observation. First, the ﬁndings
may represent contamination of the negatively selected
CD114 population with CD114þ cells during the FACS
isolation. Second, the observation may be explained by a
phenomenon of interconversion of CD114 cells to CD114þ
cells. Although this is something that has been previously
described, the ﬁnding of a CD114-derived tumor was a rare
occurrence.
CD114þ cells do not segregate with CD133 populations or
side population cells
Previously characterized tumor-initiating populations in
neuroblastoma have been deﬁned by CD133 expression or
using the "side population" cytometric assay (7, 8, 10). We
therefore sought to determine if CD114 was found to be
coexpressed with either of these populations of cells. We show
that CD114þ cells do not coexpress CD133 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) and do not segregate with side populations (based on
Hoescht dye efﬂux; Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). Our data
suggest that these putative tumorigenic neuroblastoma populations, which are primarily deﬁned by in vitro assays, likely
arise during tissue culture within the more differentiated
CD114 population.
Chemotherapy enriches for the CD114þ subpopulation
in primary neuroblastoma
We hypothesized that CD114þ cells may represent a chemoresistant subpopulation of neuroblastoma similar to CSC
populations in other tumors (4, 6, 29). We therefore analyzed
CD114 surface expression from primary human tumor samples
(Table 1). All specimens were taken from the primary tumor
site (except for one brain metastasis) during prechemotherapy
biopsy, prechemotherapy resection, or postchemotherapy surgical resection. Consistent with data from cell lines, the percentage of CD114þ cells was rare and ranged from 0.1% to 1.7%
at diagnosis (0.75%  0.41%). In contrast, CD114þ cells were
enriched 5- to 10-fold in tumors obtained from patients who
had received multiple rounds of genotoxic chemotherapy
(4.45%  2.36%;  , P < 0.001) or at relapse (7.6%; Fig. 2A
and Table 1).
We experimentally replicated this treatment-dependent
enrichment of CD114þ cells in vivo by treating tumor-bearing
mice (NGP cell line) with 3 cycles of chemotherapy, using
cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) or VP-16 (etoposide; Fig. 2B and
described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Exposure to these genotoxic agents led to a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the CD114þ subpopulation in xenograft
tumors compared with control (Cytoxan  , P < 0.05; etoposide

, P < 0.04; Fig. 2C).

CD114þ cells show a cell-cycle characteristic of
pluripotent cells
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSC) share characteristics associated with multi- or
pluripotent "stemness." An important feature is a cell cycle
with a limited G1–S checkpoint, which yields a short G0–G1phase and a prolonged S-phase (30, 31). In iPSCs this has been
shown to be due to repression of p53- and p21-mediated
checkpoint regulation (13). We therefore assessed the steady
state cell cycles of CD114þ and CD114 populations within
nonconﬂuent neuroblastoma cell lines (representing a range of
neuroblastoma phenotypes). Using bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) pulse-labeling and CD114 FACS analysis, which
permits us to concomitantly conduct analysis of the total
and CD114þ subpopulations, we uniformly show a distinctly
altered cell cycle in the CD114þ subsets relative to the CD114
subsets (33% vs. 51% G0–G1-phase, respectively,  , P < 0.0007;
54% vs. 36% S-phase, respectively,  , P < 0.0004; Fig. 3B and C).

These data are consistent with the cell cycles described for
iPSCs and ESC lines (ref. 30; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Materials
and Methods).
Gene expression of the CD114þ subpopulation is
consistent with an early neural crest derivation
We next analyzed the gene expression differences between
CD114þ and CD114 subpopulations in the NGP neuroblastoma cell line using low-density quantitative PCR (qPCR)
arrays (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Materials and Methods).
These ﬁndings were validated for individual genes with
TaqMan qPCR assays in CD114þ and CD114 subpopulations from NGP and SH-SY5Y cell lines (Fig. 5A–C and
Supplementary Table S2). We discovered that CD114þ cells
overexpress markers of early premigratory crest (e.g., SOX10,
NME1, TWIST, and ISL), mixed epithelial and mesenchymal
markers (e.g., CDH1, CDH2, VIM, and MMPs), as well as
positive cell-cycle regulators associated with maintenance of

resulting xenograft tumors recapitulate a small population of CD114þ cells and are primarily composed of CD114 progeny cells (as indicated by ﬂuorescent
lineage marking). Error bars represent SD.

pluripotency (e.g., CDC25, CDK1, and cyclin D1). Of note,
SOX10 is known to promote the survival and inhibit the
multilineage differentiation of neural crest stem cells (32). In
contrast, CD114 cells overexpress mesenchymal genes
involved in tissue invasion and angiogenesis (e.g., SNAIL1, SNAIL-2, ZEB, MMPs, ANGPT1, ans TLK) and downregulated markers of neuroepithelium. These data clearly distinguish CD114þ and CD114 cells and support a model
where CD114þ cells reﬂect an earlier state of neural crest
development (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Discussion later).
CD114þ cells overexpress miRNAs opposing neuronal
differentiation and p53 activity
miRNAs play an important role in reprogramming and
stem cell maintenance and recent studies have identiﬁed a
number of miRNAs, which regulate neuronal lineage speciﬁcation from embryonic precursors (33, 34). To evaluate
differential miRNA expression, we conducted small RNA
sequencing on RNA directly isolated from FACS-puriﬁed
CD114þ and CD114 subpopulations from 3 neuroblastoma
cell lines (NGP, IMR-32, LA-N-5). We found a highly consistent signature of 25 miRNAs differentially expressed in
CD114þ versus CD114 subpopulations (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S3). This includes 6 upregulated miRNAs
(miR-106b, 21, 25, 30e, 598, and 93) that are also upregulated
as mouse ESCs transition to neuronal precursors (Fig. 5B).
Additional studies show that number of CD114þ upregu-

4140

lated miRNAs (miR-25, 106b, 17, 18, 19, 20a, 143, and 27) are
repressed upon neuronal lineage differentiation of somatic
stem cells (33, 35, 36). In addition, miRNA pathway analysis
with 2 independent prediction platforms DIANA (DIANA
Lab) and Ingenuity (Ingenuity Systems) each showed enrichment of p53, NGF, and Notch and additional signaling
pathways driving differentiation of neuronal and neural
crest lineages (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5).
As shown in Supplementary Table S3, 15 of the CD114þ
miRNAs are validated transcriptional targets of MYCN, an
oncogenic transcription factor directly implicated in neural
crest transformation and neuroblastoma tumorigenesis (37–
39). Consistent with the emerging role of p53 repression in the
maintenance of normal and malignant stem cell populations
(13), most of these same miRNAs are known to target p53 and
its downstream targets (Fig. 5C) and have been shown to
correlate with poor prognosis in high-risk neuroblastoma
miRNAs (miRs-17, -19, -20, -25, -92, and -93; ref. 40). These
data suggest a role of miRNAs in maintenance of a dedifferentiated state in the CD114þ subpopulation of neuroblastoma
and further distinguish CD114þ from CD114 neuroblastoma
subpopulations.
Exogenous G-CSF activates downstream STAT3 signaling

additional analysis conﬁrms intact downstream signaling
upon ligation of G-CSF (Fig. 6). In the NGP and SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cell lines, treatment with G-CSF leads to a
transient increase in both CD114 expression and activation
of a STAT3 responsive reporter construct containing 4
STAT3 response elements in a promoter upstream of eGFP
(STAT3.eGFP-M67) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A
and B). We conﬁrmed that transcriptional activation correlated with increased phosphorylation of STAT3 within the
CD114þ subpopulation as detected by ﬂow cytometry (phospho-ﬂow) 30 minutes after G-CSF exposure (Fig. 6G). The
addition of a small-molecule inhibitor, which prevents phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT3 (Stattic; EMD Biosciences), speciﬁcally abrogates the effect of exogenous GCSF treatment (Fig. 6C–F). As expected, this transient
response of CD114þ cells was not detected in the CD114
population, suggesting that CD114 expression is both a
marker of a stem cell subpopulation as well as a functional
growth factor receptor for these cells.

Discussion
As with other aggressive malignancies that are composed of
multiple heterogeneous cell types with differential tumorigenic
and metastatic potential, we have identiﬁed a novel distinct
subpopulation within neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors
with similar properties. Our data show that expression of GCSF receptor (CD114), consistently identiﬁes a discrete dedifferentiated subpopulation within neuroblastoma with
markedly enhanced tumorigenicity. In addition, this population has many phenotypic similarities to iPSC and ESC cell
types including similar miRNA expression, gene expression,
and cell-cycle proﬁles. This subpopulation is distinct from
previously characterized tumorigenic populations (tumor-initiating cells) deﬁned by CD133 expression, side population
staining, or "neurosphere" assays (7, 8, 10, 11). Moreover, for
neuroblastoma, tumorigenicity of "neurosphere" derived
tumor-initiating populations can be highly variable as well as
cell line–dependent, and these in vitro conditions dramatically
alter gene expression and phenotype over time (11). In this

study, we used FACS to isolate CD114þ subpopulations
directly from patient biopsies and animal tumors without
additional ex vivo manipulation and validated these ﬁndings
in multiple cell lines. The CD114þ subpopulation consistently represents approximately 0.5% to 1.5% of tumors at
diagnosis, and the same percentage was found in all neuroblastoma cell lines analyzed. Finally, CD114þ cells express
a distinct set of genes consistent with an early neuroepithelial/neural crest phenotype, whereas CD114 gene expression correlates with the more differentiated CD114 mesenchymal neural crest populations. This places the CD114þ
subpopulation within neuroblastoma in the appropriate
developmental context for a putative neural crest derived
tumor precursor population.

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

The distinct gene and miRNA expression proﬁles of CD114þ
cells compared with CD114 cells support their role as putative
neuroblastoma tumor-initiating cells or CSCs and also concur
with current concepts of oncogene-driven neuroblastoma
pathogenesis. Neuroblastoma is uniformly p53 wild-type at
diagnosis, and previous studies have shown that p53 repression
is critical for MYCN-driven tumor initiation (41, 42). Most
recently, BMI-1–mediated repression of p53 has been shown to
play a key role in this process in TH-MYCN transgenic murine
neuroblastoma (43). There is increased expression of genes,
which restrict neural crest differentiation and inhibit apoptosis
(e.g., SOX10, STAT3, and HIF-2a) and decreased expression of
proapoptotic genes (e.g., CASP8 and p53) in the CD114þ
subpopulation. This is consistent with the resistance to

apoptosis upon withdrawal of trophic factors observed in
neuroblastoma precursors isolated from sympathetic ganglia
of
TH-MYCN transgenic mice (14). The CD114þ subpopulation
displays increased expression of multiple miRNAs with validated targets in the p53 apoptotic response pathway, as well
as miRNAs that promote reprogramming (44), stem cell cellcycle regulation (30), and neuronal differentiation (33). Interestingly, repression of p53 through STAT3 activation seems to
contribute to tumorigenesis (45), and small molecules, which
activate p53 and repress STAT3 can have potent antitumor
effects (46).
As noted earlier, STAT3 is known to mediate chemoresistance, CSC maintenance (18, 19), and neural crest speciﬁcation
(15). We show that the CD114þ population is enriched by
genotoxic chemotherapy in vivo (Fig. 2 and Table 1), and
exogenous G-CSF promotes STAT3 transcriptional activity.
These observations in a putative CSC population are further
supported by recent observations in a murine stem cell reprogramming model (47) that G-CSF–dependent STAT3 activation is sufﬁcient to drive the transition of epiblasts into

pluripotent ESCs. Thus, the ﬁnding that the CD114þ subpopulation responds to G-CSF stimulation by upregulating STAT3
transcriptional activity is consistent with current models
implicating STAT3 in normal neural crest and CSC biology.
Recently, genomic studies of neuronal differentiation
pathways have better deﬁned the earliest points at which
neural crest speciﬁcation and subsequent differentiation
occur (48, 49). Neural crest is a transient embryologic tissue,
which arises from the neuroepithelium at the borders of the
neural plate during neurulation (48). This premigratory
epithelial neural crest represents the earliest speciﬁed neural crest and has been shown to be multipotent, capable of
differentiating into many types of peripheral tissues (50).
Integral to further neural crest differentiation is an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the premigratory
neural crest into mesenchymal neural crest cells expressing
MMPs, integrins, and motility factors permitting their
migration and differentiation into a host of tissues throughout the body (49). The molecular characterization of CD114þ
and CD114 cells support a model where the transition
from the CD114þ to the CD114 neuroblastoma phenotype

Although CD114 receptor signaling is intact and responsive to

binding in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis will require additional investigation. Endogenous cellular sources of G-CSF include
mesenchymal stroma, endothelial cells, ﬁbroblasts, and monocytes/macrophages, and local signaling between these cells
and CD114þ neuroblastoma precursors could possibly support
the expansion of neuroblastoma in tumorigenic "niches" in

cytokine is used extensively to limit neutropenia in children
receiving chemotherapy for neuroblastoma and other solid
tumors. However, it remains unclear whether in addition to
endogenous sources, exogenous recombinant G-CSF could
alter the biology of neuroblastoma in vivo. Both MYCN and
ALK oncogenes drive neuroblastoma in children, and how
these oncogenes promote the expansion and maintenance of
a persistent CD114þ subpopulation within the neural crest
with enhanced self-renewal potential and tumorigenicity also
remain important questions.
