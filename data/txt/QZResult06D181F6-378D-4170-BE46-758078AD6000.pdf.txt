Abstract
Metastasis is the main reason for lung cancer–related mortality, but little is known about speciﬁc determinants of successful dissemination from primary tumors and metastasis
initiation. Here, we show that CD133þ/CXCR4þ cancer-initiating cells (CIC) directly isolated from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of non–small cell lung cancer are endowed with
superior ability to seed and initiate metastasis at distant organs.
We additionally report that CXCR4 inhibition successfully
prevents the increase of cisplatin-resistant CD133þ/CXCR4þ
cells in residual tumors and their metastatization. Immunophenotypic analysis of lung tumor cells intravenously injected
or spontaneously disseminated to murine lungs demonstrated
the survival advantage and increased colonization ability of a
speciﬁc subset of CD133þ/CXCR4þ with reduced expression of
epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which also shows
the greatest in vitro invasive potential. We next prove that
recovered disseminated cells from lungs of PDX-bearing mice

enriched for CD133þ/CXCR4þ/EpCAM CICs are highly
tumorigenic and metastatic. Importantly, microenvironment
stimuli eliciting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, including signals from cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts, are able to
increase the dissemination potential of lung cancer cells
through the generation of the CD133þ/CXCR4þ/EpCAM subset. These ﬁndings also have correlates in patient samples
where disseminating CICs are enriched in metastatic lymph
nodes (20-fold, P ¼ 0.006) and their detection in primary
tumors is correlated with poor clinical outcome (diseasefree survival: P ¼ 0.03; overall survival: P ¼ 0.05). Overall,
these results highlight the importance of speciﬁc cellular
subsets in the metastatic process, the need for in-depth characterization of disseminating tumor cells, and the potential
of therapeutic strategies targeting both primary tumor and
tumor–microenvironment interactions. Cancer Res; 75(17);

Introduction
Despite novel therapeutic strategies, survival rates for lung
cancer have not greatly improved in recent years, mostly due to
late diagnosis and limited efﬁcacy of available pharmacologic
treatments (1). Cancer-initiating cells (CIC), functionally deﬁned
as the subset of cancer cells responsible for tumor generation and
maintenance (2, 3), could also account for tumor recurrence and
metastatic seeding due to their inherent stem-like and chemoresistant properties (4).
In this context, speciﬁc subsets of tumor cells endowed with
both stemness and motility properties have been deﬁned as
migrating CICs (5, 6), and activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is pivotal in metastatic progression, has been shown to modulate stemness
properties of cancer cells, indicating a possible connection
between external cues and the generation of potential seeds
of metastasis (7–9). The subset of CICs deputed to tumor
dissemination could therefore be speciﬁcally modulated by
tumor microenvironment stimuli, as recently observed for
colon metastatic CICs (10). Studies in transgenic mouse models also indicate that dissemination is an early event and is

Identiﬁcation of Lung Cancer Metastasis-Initiating Cells

supported by tumor cells that have undergone EMT and possess
CIC features (11, 12).
Increasing evidence also shows that chemotherapy might
select for intrinsically chemoresistant CICs that could be
responsible for primary tumor recurrence (13, 14). Accordingly, we previously demonstrated that a distinct subset of
CD133þ lung CIC coexpressing the chemokine receptor CXCR4
is spared by cisplatin treatment (15). The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis
plays a crucial role in mediating tumor cell survival and the
metastatic process (16); more recently, it has been proven to
sustain CICs, through activation of self-renewal pathways (17),
and to guide their metastatic dissemination in a human pancreatic tumor model (6).
In the present study, through the analysis of a variety of lung
cancer patient–derived xenografts (PDX; ref. 18) and clinical
samples, we phenotypically characterize and functionally prove
the existence of a novel subset of CICs, regulated by the microenvironment, driving lung tumor dissemination and metastasis
and we identify CXCR4 signaling as a potential target for novel
therapeutic strategies.

Materials and Methods
List of antibodies
Antibodies used for FACS analysis were anti-human PE CD133/
1, FITC CD326 (EpCAM) (Miltenyi Biotech); APC CD187
(CXCR4; BD Pharmingen); anti-mouse PerCP-eFluor 710 MHC
class I, anti-human PerCP-eFluor 710 CD31 (eBioscience); and
anti-human PC5 CD34, PC5 CD45 (Beckman Coulter). Antihuman FITC cytokeratin (CK3-6H5, Miltenyi Biotech) was used
for immunoﬂuorescent staining. For IHC analyses, following
antibodies were used: anti-human CD133/1 (AC133, Miltenyi
Biotech), CXCR4 (CXC-4000-RM, Biotrend), keratin, Pan Ab-1
(Clone AE1/AE3, Dako), CD34 (clone QbndN/10, Neomarkers),
and low-molecular-weight cytokeratins (clone AE1/AE3/PCK26,
Ventana Medical Systems). Detailed protocols for ﬂow cytometry,
immunoﬂuorescence, and IHC staining are in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Tissue dissociation and culture
Clinical specimens were obtained from a consecutive series of
97 consenting patients (17 also had matching lymph nodes
available). The protocol was approved by the Internal Review
and the Ethics Boards of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale
Tumori of Milan.
The protocol for primary tumors, lymph nodes, PDXs, and
murine lungs tissue dissociation was already described (15).
Culture method to obtain cancer tissue–originated spheroids
(CTOS) and murine lung tissue spheroids was adapted from
Kondo and colleagues (19). Protocols are detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell lines and treatments
All tumor cell lines were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS at 37 C
under 5% CO2. The LT73 primary cell line was derived from a
surgical specimen of a male patient with lung adenocarcinoma.
The H460 cell line (lung large cell carcinoma) was purchased from
ATCC and authenticated by DNA short tandem repeat (STR)
proﬁling.
To induce EMT, cell cultures were treated with TGFb (5 ng/mL;
Peprotech) for 5 up to 15 days.

CTCE-9908 inhibitor and corresponding scramble control
peptide were kindly provided by British Canadian BioSciences
Corp. and used for in vitro cell culture treatment at 10 mg/mL
for 30 minutes at 37 C in the appropriate growing medium
(RPMI-1640 plus 1% FBS or in stem cell medium), before FACS
analysis or in in vitro invasion assays, detailed in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Animal studies
In vivo experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for
Animal Experimentation of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, according to institutional guidelines.
PDX were established from primary lung cancers from patients
undergoing surgical resection, who gave their informed consent
and expanded as previously described (18).
For in vivo combination therapy, cisplatin (Teva Pharma) was
administered i.v. at 5 mg/kg every 7 days for 3 weeks, starting
when tumors were palpable (50 mm3). CTCE-9908 was administered i.p. (50 mg/kg) once every 5 days after cisplatin administration for 3 weeks.
A human-in-mice model of bone metastasis was established, as
previously reported (20). A bone metastasis assay was performed
by injecting s.c. close to human bone implant 1  105 cells sorted
from PDX models for CD133 and CXCR4 or by intracardiac (i.c.)
route, injecting in the left ventricle 1  104 sorted cells in 100 mL
physiologic solution. See also Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Integrated strategies to detect disseminating tumor cells in
murine lung
To set up the most robust strategy to detect disseminating
tumor cells (DTC) in murine lungs, intravenous injection of scalar
doses of H460 cells was performed in SCID mice (n ¼ 2 mice for
each dose) and lungs were analyzed 2 hours after injection by
FACS, real-time PCR, and IHC.
For FACS analysis, injected tumor cells were identiﬁed using
a negative gating strategy to exclude 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7-AADþ) dead cells and mouse H2Kþ cells that was able to
speciﬁcally detect as few as 103 single tumor cells in murine lungs
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
For detection of tumor cells in murine lungs by real-time PCR,
analysis of human-speciﬁc b2 microglobulin (B2M) housekeeping gene expression was performed (Supplementary Fig. S1B and
Supplementary Materials and Methods).
IHC analysis on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE)
lung tissue for pan-cytokeratins (CK) expression was able to
robustly identify single cells when injected at 104. To detect lower
number of single cells, at least 5 serial sections of FFPE lung tissue,
cut at 1.5-mm thickness, had to be analyzed (Supplementary
Fig. S1C).

Results
The subset of CD133þCXCR4þ lung CICs is endowed with
increased seeding and metastatic potential
To verify the presence of a metastatic subset in lung CICs, we
analyzed by FACS 78 primary human non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) for CD133 and CXCR4 expression: double-positive
cells accounted for 0.3% of total tumor cells (median value range,
0%–8%) and represented 20% of CD133þ cells (median value

range, 0%–100%). Interestingly, when primary tumors were
compared with matched lymph node metastasis (n ¼ 17), the
frequency of CD133þ cells coexpressing CXCR4 was signiﬁcantly
higher in metastases (3-fold enrichment, P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 1A).
To dissect the metastatic potential of different subpopulations
of lung CICs, CD133þCXCR4þ and CD133þCXCR4 cells sorted
from different PDXs (n ¼ 5), from a primary cell line freshly
established from a lung adenocarcinoma sample (Lung Tumor
73, LT73) and from H460 cells were injected in the tail vein of
SCID mice. CD133CXCR4 non–CICs were used as control. To
detect and monitor during time tumor cells in murine lungs, we
set up and validated a method on the basis of ﬂow cytometric
analysis, not relying on speciﬁc human antigens expression
and supported by qRT-PCR and IHC analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S1A–S1C). Three months after injection, rare tumor cells were
detectable in murine lungs and were consistently higher in the
groups injected with CD133þCXCR4þ (2-fold increase þ/þ vs.
þ/; 5-fold increase þ/þ vs. /, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 1B). After an
extended period of time (6 months), CD133þCXCR4þ cells,
sorted from one PDX model (LT111) and LT73 and H460 cell
lines, showed their full metastatic potential and greatest ability to
colonize murine lungs compared with other injected groups as
reveled by both FACS analysis (4.5-fold increase, P ¼ 0.0003 þ/þ
vs. þ/; 6.4 fold increase, P ¼ 0.0006 þ/þ vs. /; Fig. 1B) and
histologic analysis (Fig. 1C): software-assisted quantiﬁcation of
macroscopic areas of tumor invasion clearly demonstrated the
higher degree of inﬁltration of lung parenchyma of doublepositive cells compared with moderate and slight degree of
inﬁltration of single-positive and double-negative cells (P ¼
0.0003 þ/þ vs. þ/; P ¼ 0.0004 þ/þ vs. /; Fig. 1D). A relevant
inﬂammatory inﬁltrate, mainly consisting of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes, was also observed associated with tumor foci (Fig. 1C)
possibly explaining the long latency periods before metastatic
cells proliferation. The phenotype of injected double-positive
cells remained unchanged during early colonization steps, implying that their survival advantage enables them to support metastasis initiation (Fig. 1E).
To conﬁrm the high metastatic properties of CD133þCXCR4þ
cells and their selective advantage in seeding different organs, we
exploited an innovative model of humanized mice implanted
with human bone (20, 21), the second more frequent metastatic
site of NSCLC. The implanted human bone, detected in the mouse
ﬂank by X-rays examination, was viable as indicated by the
presence of bone marrow cells, mineralized areas, stromal cells,
and neovascularization (Fig. 2A). Unsorted tumor cells and
CD133þCXCR4þ, CD133þCXCR4, and CD133CXCR4 subsets were isolated from two PDXs (LT59 and LT111) and injected
both s.c. and intracardially in mice bearing bone, to model
different aspects of bone seeding. CD133þCXCR4þ cells were
able to colonize human bone generating metastatic lesion after
both s.c. and i.c. injection with high efﬁciency (65%, 9 of 14 mice),
conversely CD133þCXCR4 and CD133CXCR4 cells did not

Identiﬁcation of Lung Cancer Metastasis-Initiating Cells

remodeling, revealed by large areas of new bone apposition and
an increased osteoid thickness due to metastasis formation, was
evident in mice injected with CD133þCXCR4þ cells compared
with all other groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C and D). Notably, CD133þ
CXCR4þ cells injected both s.c. and i.c. in mice carrying human
bone implants also showed signiﬁcantly higher ability to disseminate and initiate lung metastasis, with extensive replacement of
normal lung parenchyma with cancer cells (Fig. 2E), compared
with CD133þCXCR4 and CD133CXCR4 cells or unsorted
cells (CD133þCXCR4þ vs. others groups, P ¼ 0.007; Supplementary Table S1).
Altogether, these results prove the high dissemination and
colonization potential of CD133þCXCR4þ cells and their ability
to support metastasis development at distant organs.
Inhibition of the CXCR4 pathway prevents metastatic spread of
chemoresistant CD133þCXCR4þ cells
To block the migration of the CD133þCXCR4þ metastatic
subset, we tested the CXCR4 inhibitor CTCE-9908, a small peptide analogue of SDF-1, previously shown to be effective in
preventing metastatic dissemination in different cancer models
(22–25).
In vitro CTCE-9908 treatment could block invasion of PDXderived tumor cells (n ¼ 4 PDX models) induced by both SDF-1
and FBS (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we also veriﬁed that the invading
fraction of PDXs cells attracted with a nonspeciﬁc signal (FBS) was
10-fold enriched in CD133þCXCR4þ cells compared with total
population and that CTCE-9908 inhibitor was able to speciﬁcally
block their invasion (4-fold change; Fig. 3B), thus pointing at
CXCR4 axis as a pivotal mediator of lung CIC invasion.
To test the efﬁcacy of CXCR4 inhibition in a clinically relevant
therapeutic setting, we treated in vivo metastatic H460 xenografts
with CTCE-9908 in combination with standard chemotherapy.
We previously reported that cisplatin treatment, although effective in reducing tumor size, induces enrichment of chemoresistant
CICs in the residual tumor (15). Combination treatment with
CTCE-9908 had a similar efﬁcacy in inhibiting subcutaneous
tumor growth as cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S2A), but it was
able to prevent the relative increase of CD133þCXCR4þ cells and
concomitant upregulation of stemness genes induced by chemotherapy alone (Fig. 3C and D).
FACS analysis of H460 lung metastases in control mice demonstrated a 10-fold enrichment for CD133þCXCR4þ cells compared with matched s.c. xenograft (P < 0.05), conﬁrming their
pivotal role also in the spontaneous metastasis development
(Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Cisplatin treatment primed the dissemination of the
CD133þCXCR4þ subset (2-fold change) inducing a boost in
metastasis formation (1.8-fold change) compared with control
group (Fig. 3E and F). Combination therapy with CXCR4
inhibitor was able to counteract cisplatin effect, drastically
reducing metastatic formation (2-fold decrease) and concomitantly decreasing the subsets of CD133þ and CD133þCXCR4þ

Identiﬁcation of Lung Cancer Metastasis-Initiating Cells

cells in lung metastasis compared with cisplatin-treated group
(2.6- and 2.3-fold change, respectively; Fig. 3E and F and
Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Next, we also proved in a highly disseminating PDX model
(LT111) that in vivo combination treatment with CTCE-9908 had
a modest effect on tumor growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig.
S2D) but was able to prevent tumor spread associated with
cisplatin treatment (1.5-fold change) and to efﬁciently reduce
the fraction of disseminated CD133þCXCR4þ CICs to murine
lungs (4.7-fold change; Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S2E).
We additionally veriﬁed in cell lines that CXCR4 is also frequently expressed (mean, 70%; range, 50%–90%) in another
subset of CICs previously identiﬁed as chemoresistant
(CD133þABCG2þ; ref. 15) and that CXCR4 inhibition could also
prevent enrichment of CD133þCXCR4þABCG2þ induced by
chemotherapy (data not shown).
Our results suggest that combination treatment with CXCR4
inhibitor could speciﬁcally impair dissemination of chemoresistant and metastatic CD133þCXCR4þ cells.
CD133þCXCR4þ and EpCAM CICs have survival advantage at
ectopic sites in early steps of colonization
To examine the role of CD133þCXCR4þ cells in different steps
of the metastatic cascade, we injected i.v. 1  106 unsorted
lung tumor cells endowed with different metastatic behavior
(LT111-PDX cells, weakly metastatic; LT73 cell line, moderately
metastatic; H460 cell line, highly metastatic), and we monitored
in time course experiment which tumor cell subsets were preferentially selected to drive speciﬁc steps of metastasis development.
Flow cytometric analysis of murine lung 2 hours after injection
conﬁrmed the presence of tumor cells that maintained the same
phenotype of original tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). After
1 week, the number of tumor cells drastically decreased (20-fold)
with a concomitant enrichment for the CD133þCXCR4þ subset in
the surviving tumor fraction (Fig. 4A). We also detected in LT73
and LT111 surviving cells a signiﬁcant increase for a fraction of
CD133þ CICs negative for the expression of epithelial antigen
EpCAM compared with parental injected tumor cells (18-fold
increase), whereas the parental H460 cell line does not express at
all EpCAM marker (Fig. 4A). Surviving LT111 cells remained in
murine lung, without proliferating, for up to 3 months and stably
showed enrichment for CD133þCXCR4þ and CD133þEpCAM
subsets (Fig. 4A). Conversely, during metastatic growth of LT73
and H460 cells, both subsets of CD133þCXCR4þ and CD133þ
EpCAM cells, diminished and reverted to the original percentage
of the parental cell line when metastases reached macroscopic size
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Expression of stemness
genes followed the same trend of CD133þCXCR4þ cells in the
different phases of metastatic development (Fig. 4B).
In summary, these ﬁndings conﬁrm the primary role of
CD133þCXCR4þ CICs in metastasis process, due to a superior

survival advantage and colonization ability, and reveal the existence of the CD133þEpCAM subset strongly enriched in early
steps of colonization.
The subset of CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM CICs sustains lung
cancer dissemination and is endowed with high tumorigenic
and metastatic potential
To further investigate the involvement of the CD133þCXCR4þ
and EpCAM subsets in a preclinical model of spontaneous
tumor dissemination, we analyzed lungs of PDX-bearing SCID
mice.
While generally no histologic metastases were evident, FACS
analysis was able to detect a subset of DTCs in 9 of 11 PDX models
(n ¼ 6 adenocarcinoma; 1 large cell carcinoma, LCC; 2 squamous
cell carcinoma models, SCC), in a percentage (range, 0.001%%–
0.01%) consistent with that estimated from human B2M expression by qRT-PCR (data not shown).
Lung DTCs were already detectable at early stages of subcutaneous tumor development and remained stable during tumor
growth (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Notably, immunophenotyping of lung DTCs revealed a constant increase for the fraction of
CD133þCXCR4þ CICs (P ¼ 0.04) and in particular a predominant enrichment for the subset of CD133þEpCAM cells (P ¼
0.007) compared with parental subcutaneous tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), conﬁrming evidence obtained in i.v.
time course experiments.
Moreover, an in vitro invasion assay on dissociated PDX cells
(n ¼ 5) proved that CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM cells represented
the CIC subset more signiﬁcantly enriched in the invading
fraction compared with total population (90-fold, P ¼ 0.01;
Fig. 5A).
To functionally characterize the subset of lung DTCs enriched
in disseminating CICs, we adapted an in vitro culture method
useful to enrich for tumor cells (19); from 6 different PDXs
(4 adenocarcinoma, 1 SCC, 1 LCC), we generated cultures of
CTOS and corresponding lung tissue spheroids, highly enriched
in DTCs compared with freshly dissociated lung tissue (range, 70to 145-fold increase) as also conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR analysis for
hB2M expression and by staining for human cytokeratins (Fig. 5B
and Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Real-time analysis of lung spheroids cultures showed a strong
upregulation for stemness genes and for a panel of EMT-related
genes in DTCs compared with matching PDX-CTOS, subtending
an enrichment for the subset of CD133þ stem–like cells endowed
with mesenchymal features (i.e., EpCAM; Fig. 5C).
To functionally test tumorigenic properties of DTCs, we s.c.
injected in NOD-SCID mice 1  105 lung spheroids dissociated
cells, containing approximately 200 DTCs and 1  105 PDX-CTOS
dissociated cells generated from LT59 PDX. DTCs were able to
originate tumors that closely resembled histology and phenotype
of original PDX (Fig. 5D) but contained a larger amount of

Identiﬁcation of Lung Cancer Metastasis-Initiating Cells

CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM cells compared with parental xenograft (Fig. 5E). Moreover, cells from DTC tumors maintained a
slightly increased expression of EMT-related genes compared with
CTOS tumors and exclusively possessed the ability to proliferate
in vitro as spheres in anchorage-independent condition (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E).
Remarkably, in vivo s.c. injection of cells from DTC tumors
demonstrated an enhanced ability to generate secondary
tumors (Fig. 5F) and higher lung dissemination ability compared with CTOS tumor (disseminated tumor cells: 0.6%  SD
0.1 vs. 0.09%  SD 0.03; Fig. 5G).
Finally, intravenous injection of LT59 lung spheroids dissociated cells (	200 DTCs) in NOD-SCID mice generated lung
metastases, which again showed an increased fraction CD133þ
CXCR4þEpCAM cells, whereas up to 1  105 LT59 cells and
LT59-CTOS cells failed to initiate metastasis (Fig. 5H).
Our evidence proves the existence of an invasive and highly
tumorigenic CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM subset that speciﬁcally
drives lung tumor dissemination.
Microenvironment stimuli modulate the subset of CD133þ
CXCR4þEpCAM lung disseminating CICs
The mesenchymal properties displayed by CD133þ
CXCR4þEpCAM disseminating CICs, lead us to investigate the
possible involvement of EMT activation in their generation/modulation (26).
Induction of EMT through TGFb treatment of the LT73 tumor
cell line (LT73-EMT) evaluated as morphologic changes, modulation of EMT-related genes, and increased invasive potential
(Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C), caused a 10-fold increase in the
fraction of CD133þ CICs (P ¼ 0.0001) with a concomitant
upregulation of stemness gene expression (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S5D). We also veriﬁed that LT73-EMT cells showed
an expression pattern for EMT and stemness-related genes more
similar to mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and then to differentiated adult mesenchymal cells (i.e., ﬁbroblasts derived from
primary lung tumors; Fig. 6B).
Increase of CD133þ CICs in LT73-EMT cells was functionally
proved by enhanced in vivo tumorigenic potential and ensuing
tumors stably maintained an augmented content of CD133þ cells
compared with LT73 parental tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5E
and S5F).
Examination of CD133þ CIC subsets in LT73-EMT cells
demonstrated a 3.8-fold increase (P ¼ 0.04) for metastatic
CD133þCXCR4þ cells that was mainly driven by the expansion
of CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM subpopulation (13.5-fold increase,
P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 6C).
In PDXs and primary CTOS cultures (n ¼ 5), EMT induced by
TGFb was able to enrich for CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM disseminating CICs (15-fold change, P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 6D and Supplemenþ

tary Fig. S5G), associated with an increased in vitro invasiveness
and upregulation of EMT and stemness genes (Supplementary
Fig. S5H and S5I).
To evaluate whether the CIC enrichment was due to an
expansion of the pre-existing CD133þ pool or to de novo
generation, we depleted CD133þ cells by FACS from the LT73
cell line, creating the LT73-CD133 line that stably maintained
a CD133 phenotype during in vitro culturing (Fig. 6E). TGFb
treatment of LT73-CD133 cells induced the generation of a
fraction of CD133þ cells (mean  SD, 0.14%  0.05%), similar
to that observed in LT73 parental cells (mean  SD, 0.09% 
0.02%), that however exhibited a lower expression of EpCAM
compared with endogenous CD133þ cells (Fig. 6E). Upon TGFb
withdrawal, LT73-CD133 cells slowly reverted to an epithelial
phenotype, whereas the fraction of de novo generated mesenchymal CD133þ cells persisted, indicating a stable reprogramming (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S5L and S5M). Consistently, tumors derived from s.c. injection of LT73-CD133 EMT
appeared with a shorter latency period than LT73-CD133 cells
and maintained a similar fraction of de novo generated CD133þ
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5N and S5O).
To verify whether physiologically relevant tumor microenvironment stimuli could show similar proﬁciency in generating
lung CICs, LT73-CD133 cells were cocultured with conditioned
medium (CM) from cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF) isolated
from primary human lung tumors. A variable but constantly
detectable fraction of de novo CD133þ cells was observed after
exposure to different CMs, mirrored by a parallel modulation of
EMT genes (Fig. 6F and G) indicating that also stimuli from
microenvironment are able to endow tumor cells with mesenchymal traits associated with CIC generation.
Because stromal SFD-1 has been proven to induce EMT
activation in different tumor types (27, 28), we explored the
role of SDF-1 as a possible mediator of CAF effects on tumor
cells. In line with reported evidence, we conﬁrmed that in vitro
treatment of the LT73 cell line with SDF-1 resulted in upregulation of EMT genes (Supplementary Fig. S5P). Treatment of
LT73-CD133 cells with CMs and CXCR4 inhibitor CTCE9908 demonstrated a partial prevention of EMT genes modulation compared with CMs alone, thus conﬁrming that SDF-1
represents one of the CAF-secreted factors that mediate EMT
activation in tumor cells (Fig. 6G).
CM-generated CD133þ CICs were functionally associated with
an enhanced in vivo tumorigenicity compared with untreated
CD133 cells (Fig. 6H), and interestingly, the ensuing xenografts
displayed a CD133 fraction reﬂecting the proﬁciency of CAF-CMs
to create CICs in vitro (Fig. 6I). Notably, the relative percentages of
de novo generated CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM cells detected in CMtreated LT73-CD133 tumors correlated with their disseminating
potential to murine lungs (Fig. 6I and J).

of EpCAMþ tumor cells. The CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM fraction

pool was more frequent in SCCs (P ¼ 0.017). Interestingly, both
CD133þ and CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM content was associated
with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P ¼
0.025 and P ¼ 0.011, respectively), indicating a possible role of
the lung microenvironment in modulating stemness and disseminating properties. More importantly, while the total amount of
CD133þ cells did not correlate with clinical outcome, the presence
of the CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM subset was negatively correlated
with both disease-free survival (DFS, P ¼ 0.033) and overall
survival (OS, P ¼ 0.055; Fig. 7B). The association of disseminating
CICs with DFS remained signiﬁcant also in subclass analyses
when only nonsquamous tumors were analyzed (P ¼ 0.038) and
in a multivariate model even after adjustment for stage [P ¼ 0.03;
HR, 2.25; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 1.05–4.82]. Particularly,
in tumors with low content of CD133þ cells (2%), the presence
of CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM metastatic CICs was associated
in multivariate analysis with both shorter DFS (P ¼ 0.03; HR,
3.34; 95% CI, 1.09–10.18) and OS (P ¼ 0.05; HR, 3.10, 95% CI,
1.00–9.59), thus representing a risk factor for tumor relapse and
poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC.

Discussion
Although metastasis has generally been considered a multistep process requiring acquisition of speciﬁc genetic alterations providing tumor cells with crucial advantages (29),
plasticity is gaining attention as a fundamental trait for
metastasis-prone tumors, and the identiﬁcation of deﬁnite
phenotypes linked to this process appears crucial for its
understanding (30).
Here, we demonstrate that the subset of CD133þCXCR4þ lung
CICs drives tumor cells seeding and metastasis initiation in lung
cancer. The high metastatic potential of CD133þCXCR4þ cells
and their enhanced ability to seed and colonize different organs
(i.e., lung and bone) is substantiated in experimental lung metastasis as well as in an humanized murine model of bone metastasis:
interestingly, in such an experimental model, the presence of a
"human pre-metastatic niche" represented by implanted bone
is conductive for generation of overt metastases in a considerable shorter time than in an experimental metastasis assay,
stressing the importance of proﬁcient niche to support and
dictate tumor development and the challenge of recapitulating
the human microenvironment in mouse (31–33).
Next, we prove for the ﬁrst time that CXCR4 targeting is able to
counteract the chemotherapy-induced metastatic spread of chemoresistant fractions of CD133þCXCR4þ and possibly also of
CD133þABCG2þ CICs (15) that mostly express CXCR4 receptors,
pointing at combination therapy with CXCR4 inhibitor as an
attractive novel strategy to improve neoadjuvant and adjuvant
therapy for NSCLC.
Time course analysis of phenotypic changes in i.v. injected
tumor cells at different steps of metastatic cascade revealed in
the ﬁrst phase of colonization an enrichment for a subset of
lung CD133þCXCR4þ cells negative for EpCAM; similar
enrichment was observed in spontaneous early disseminated
tumor cells detected in PDX preclinical models. These data are

in line with evidence in different tumor types for an early
tumor metastatic spread guided by cells endowed with mesenchymal and stem-like features (11, 12, 34). Besides the
phenotypic characterization, we functionally prove that lung
DTCs, surviving in ectopic murine soil without metastatic
outgrowth, are indeed highly tumorigenic and metastatic
when injected s.c. with Matrigel or i.v. in NOD/SCID mice,
proving the metastasis initiation potential of the speciﬁc
subset of CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM cells, as well as highlighting once more the need of a favorable metastatic niche to
dictate tumor growth (32, 33, 35).
Remarkably, tumors generated from DTCs, as well as patient's
lymph nodes metastases, are enriched in the CD133þ
CXCR4þEpCAM CIC subset, demonstrating in a clinical setting,
the relevance of this subpopulation in metastasis formation.
The mesenchymal features of disseminating tumor cells as
well as the well-known link between EMT activation and
acquisition of invasiveness and stem-like features prompted
us to investigate the possible involvement of EMT in their
generation (7, 36, 37). Our data indeed conﬁrmed that EMT
triggering generates CD133þ cells and, more interestingly, we
demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that stimuli from tumor microenvironment, speciﬁcally those from CAF, could dictate de novo
creation of the CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM CIC subset directly
linked to EMT induction and acquisition of in vitro and in vivo
increased dissemination. Similar data proving the capability of
microenvironmental stimuli to convert progenitor cells into
cancer stem cells with metastatic properties are reported in
colon cancer (10).
Moreover our ﬁnding showing that CAF-secreted SDF-1 promotes EMT activation and likely the acquisition of stemness
features in lung tumor cells, in line with evidence reported in
colorectal cancer (27), strengthens the potential therapeutic use of
CXCR4 inhibitor to prevent both dissemination of metastatic
CICs and their generation through the impairment of tumor–
stroma cross-talk.
The clinical relevance of our ﬁndings was demonstrated by
the fact that the frequency of CD133þCXCR4þEpCAM within
the CIC pool in primary tumors represents an independent
indicator of poor prognosis in surgically resected NSCLC
patients, suggesting that dissection of the biologic complexity
of primary tumors will be crucial to improve clinical management of lung cancer.
The prospective to identify the fraction of metastatic CD133þ
CXCR4þ CICs negative for EpCAM expression in circulating
tumor cells from patients with lung cancer holds therefore great
interest and implications from both a prognostic and therapeutic
point of view, as recently highlighted in patients with breast cancer
where isolated EpCAM circulating tumor cells showed high
invasiveness and ability to generate brain and lung metastases
(38–40).
In conclusion, we provide evidence for the existence of novel
human lung disseminating CICs regulated by microenvironmental signals able to complete all the steps of the metastatic cascade
and related to clinical recurrence. We also propose CXCR4 targeting as a novel therapeutic option in neoadjuvant and adjuvant
setting to counteract the dissemination of chemoresistant and
metastatic lung CICs.
