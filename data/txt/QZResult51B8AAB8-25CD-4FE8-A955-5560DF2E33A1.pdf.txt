Abstract
Extensive oncologic experience argues that the most efﬁcacious applications of antiangiogenic agents rely
upon a combination with cytotoxic drugs. Yet there remains a lack of clarity about how to optimize scheduling for
such drug combinations. Prudent antiangiogenic therapy might transiently normalize blood vessels to improve
tumor oxygenation and drug exposure. Using [15O]H2O positron emission tomography imaging in a preclinical
mouse model of non–small cell lung cancer, we observed that short-term treatment with the vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor/platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor PTK787 licensed a transient window of
improved tumor blood ﬂow. The improvement observed was associated with a reduced leakiness from tumor
vessels, consistent with induction of a vascular normalization process. Initiation of a cytotoxic treatment in this
window of tumor vessel normalization resulted in increased efﬁcacy, as illustrated by improved outcomes of
erlotinib administration after initial PTK787 treatment. Notably, intermittent PTK787 treatment also facilitated
long-term tumor regression. In summary, our ﬁndings offer strong evidence that short-term antiangiogenic
therapy can promote a transient vessel normalization process that improves the delivery and efﬁcacy of a targeted
cytotoxic drug. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2816–24. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Solid tumors cannot grow without access to and recruitment of blood vessels (1, 2). Tumor vessels are characterized by
a leaky, disorganized, and abnormal phenotype (3). This leakiness leads to extravasation of plasma proteins, resulting in a
high interstitial ﬂuid pressure within tumors that interferes
with the delivery of drugs (4). Moreover, this abnormal phenotype of tumor vasculature supports tumor progression and
resistance to treatment. The goal of antiangiogenic treatment
is to inhibit tumor vessel growth, thus abrogating the delivery
of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor. Antiangiogenic compounds target either angiogenic growth factors such as bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) or receptor kinases that are known to
regulate tumor angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial

growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR). However, recent data indicate that a
reduction in tumor vessels induced by antiangiogenic treatment using an antibody against VEGFR2 (DC101) results in an
inhibition of tumor growth but on the other hand permits
tumor invasiveness (5). This increase in invasiveness is most
probably because of elevated hypoxia within the tumor during
antiangiogenic therapy (6).
Nevertheless there is strong evidence that transient application of antiangiogenic agents can "normalize" the abnormal
tumor microvessels (7, 8). This prudent application of antiangiogenic therapy might result in effective uptake of drugs
and oxygen in the tumor-enhancing cytotoxic therapeutic
outcome in cancer therapy (4, 9). Moreover, structurally and
functionally abnormal blood vessels impair blood ﬂow into the
tumor contributing to an aggressive hypoxic microenvironment rendering the tumor unresponsive to traditional cytotoxic treatment regimes (10).
Using MRI we could recently demonstrate that short-term
antiangiogenic treatment with a small molecule protein
kinase inhibitor Vatalanib (PTK787) results in a reduction
of vessel leakiness (11). Based on these ﬁndings we speculate
that antiangiogenic treatment induced normalization of
tumor vessels might increase tumor blood ﬂow and reduce
interstitial ﬂuid pressure (IFP). This reduction of the IFP and
increase of tumor blood ﬂow during antiangiogenic treatment might improve anticancer drug delivery and, thus,
treatment efﬁcacy (12).

Improving Drug Delivery by Tumor Vessel Normalization

PTK787 (ZK 222584) and ZD6474 are potent inhibitors of
VEGFR tyrosine kinases, PDGFRb tyrosine kinase and c-Kit
whereas ZD6474 in addition targets the EGF receptor
(EGFR) and RET (13, 14). We here sought to apply a
multimodal imaging approach to monitor tumor blood ﬂow
in vivo to assess the normalization window during prudent
antiangiogenic treatment using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors PTK787 and ZD6474. Imaging tumor vessel normalization induced by prudent antiangiogenic treatment was used
to improve drug delivery of targeted compounds such as
erlotinib and GDC0941.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H1975 was
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. PC9
was purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures. Both
cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium enriched
with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin þ streptomycin. ZD6474,
PTK787, and erlotinib were purchased from LC labs and
GDC0941 from Axon Medchem. Compound stocks were stored
at 20 C and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide in vitro. For in
vivo studies, erlotinib was dissolved in 6% Captisol (CyDex Inc.)
at a concentration of 9 mg/mL. GDC0941 was dissolved in MCT
(0.5% methylcellulose with 0.2% Tween-80 in distilled water) at
concentrations of 22.5 mg/mL (monotherapy) and 15 mg/mL
(in combination with antiangiogenic therapy). ZD6474 and
PTK787 were dissolved in sterilized, deionized water with 1%
Tween 80 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. All solutions were
stored on a rotating device at 4 C for animal therapy.
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described previously
(15). For Western blotting, the following antibodies were used:
b-actin (clone C4; MPBiomedicals LLC), pEGFR, pAKT (S473),
pERK (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-rabbit-horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) antibody, and anti-mouse-HRP antibody
(Millipore).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Vascular leakage was assessed by intravenous injection of
0.1 mL 10 mg/mL FITC-dextran (200,000 kDa) from Sigma.
After 30 minutes, mice were anesthetized followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde injected into the aorta via an
incision in the left ventricle and washed one time with PBS.
Blood and ﬁxative passaged out via the right atrium. Tumor
sections were collected and immersed in 30% sucrose solution
until samples dropped to the bottom of the vials. A cold bath
was prepared with dry ice and methanol. Tissue Tek wells were
labeled and ﬁlled up with Jung tissue freezing medium (Leica
Biosystems). Excess sucrose was removed from tissues and
placed in the center of wells and frozen by ﬂoating them on the
methanol bath. Blocks were stored at 20 C and sliced at 10
to 20 mm on cryostat. Slides were dried at room temperature
for at least 2 hours and stained with anti-mouse CD31 (1:25;
BD Pharmingen), anti-pVEGFR-2 (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology), ﬁxed and processed for analysis in a Biorevo (Keyence)
BZ-9000 microscope.

Tumor samples and immunohistochemistry
All tumors were collected after perfusion, stored in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight, and transferred to PBS. Tissues
were embedded in parafﬁn following standard protocol and
stained with primary antibodies as follows: mouse CD31 (1:25;
BD Pharmingen), cleaved caspase-3 (1:750; Cell Signaling),
pAKT (1:25; Cell Signaling), and a-smooth muscle actin a-SMA
(1:50; Abcam) for marking pericytes. Corresponding secondary
antibody detection kits for reduced background on murine
tissue were used (Histoﬁne Simple Stain Mouse MAX PO;
medac) and stained on an automated stainer (LabVision
Autostainer 480 S; Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Xenograft experiments
All animal procedures were approved by the local animal
protection committee and the local authorities (Bezirksregierung K€
oln). Eight weeks old healthy nu/nu athymic male mice
weighing 30 g in an average were purchased from Janvier.
Tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection of PC9 and
H1975 tumor cells (5  105 cells/tumor). Tumor-bearing mice
were treated by oral gavage with the following set-ups: PTK787
(n ¼ 8 mice with 3 tumors/mouse) or ZD6474 (n ¼ 8 mice with
3 tumors/mouse) 75 mg/kg daily as monotherapy, erlotinib 30
mg/kg daily as monotherapy (n ¼ 8 mice with 3 tumors/
mouse), GDC0941 75 mg/kg daily as monotherapy (n ¼ 8 mice
with 3 tumors/mouse), vehicle (n ¼ 5 mice with 3 tumors/
mouse), erlotinib 30 mg/kg (n ¼ 14 mice with 3 tumors/
mouse), or GDC0941 50 mg/kg (n ¼ 8 mice with 3 tumors/
mouse) pretreated with PTK787 and continued as monotherapy during indicated timespan. The size of tumors ranged
between 70 and 125 mm3. Monotherapy and vehicle of each
drug was used as control. Tumor volume was recorded
accordingly.
[15O]H2O/[18F]FLT positron emission tomography
imaging
Animals bearing macroscopic tumors were investigated on
day 0 followed by start of treatment with PTK787 75 mg/kg or
ZD6474 75 mg/kg daily, day 4, day 8, and day 18 using a FOCUS
microPET scanner (Siemens Microsystems, Inc; max. transaxial resolution 1.3 mm). In total, 25 animals underwent [15O]H2O
and [18F]FLT imaging, each animal carried 3 tumors. The
PTK787-treated group contained 15 animals, the vehicle-treated group 10 mice. All animals underwent positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging at 4 different time points. Initially
32 animals were included in the study, 7 of 32 mice died during
PET imaging. We calculated percentage changes in tracer
uptake with day 0 as baseline for each time point and tumor.
[15O]H2O PET imaging was performed before [18F]FLT PET.
[18F]FLT PET was measured 1 hour after [15O]H2O PET.
[15O]H2O was injected dynamically via tail vein and PET images
were acquired for 2 minutes after injection of 400 mCi/mouse.
[18F]FLT was administered intravenously (200 mCi/mouse).
PET imaging was performed 60 minutes after injection (16).
Data evaluation was performed using in-house VINCI software.
Data evaluation was based on a region of interest (ROI)
analysis. For data analysis we used the maximal and the mean
voxel radioactivity of the deﬁned ROI within the tumors. The

size of tumors ranged between 70 and 125 mm3. The mediastinum was chosen as a reference for determination of uptake
ratio, because we observed constant uptake for [18F]FLT in this
region. The heart was used as reference for calculation of the
[15O]H2O. All data were decay corrected.
Mass spectrometry
For absolute quantiﬁcation of erlotinib and OSI-420 in
positive ESI MRM (multi reaction monitoring) mode, a Acquitiy UPLC/Xevo TQ (Waters) with MassLynx and absolute
quantiﬁcation TargetLynx (Waters) were used. An Acquity
UPLC BEH C18 1.7 mm, 2.1  50 mm column was used at
25 C. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid (Biosolve) and B acetonitrile (Biosolve). A linear gradient from 95% A to 5% in 4.10
min at a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min was used. The following MRM
transitions were used for erlotinib m/z 394.03 (MþHþ)þ to
277.95 (quantiﬁer), m/z 394.03 to 303.95 (qualiﬁer), m/z 394.03
to 335.94 (qualiﬁer), for OSI-420 m/z 380.03 to 277.85 (quantiﬁer), m/z 380.03 to 249.89 (qualiﬁer), m/z 380.03 to 321.93
(qualiﬁer). All compounds were fresh prepared during 2
months and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (Biosolve) prepared
with 0.22 mm MilliQ-Water. With erlotinib eluting at 2.94
minutes a standard calibration curve was calculated using
following concentrations: 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 20, 50, 150, 300, 500,
and 750 ng/mL (prepared individually from stock solutions
100 mg/mL). With OSI-420 eluting at 2.51 minutes a standard
calibration curve was calculated using following concentrations: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 ng/mL (prepared individually
from stock solutions 100 mg/mL). Correlation coefﬁcient:
r < 0.990; response type: external standard, area; curve type
linear; weighting 1/. The peak integrations were corrected
manually, if necessary. Quality control standards of each
standard were used during sample analysis and showed
between 0.5% and 40% deviation respectively. Blanks after
the standards, quality control and sample batch proved to be
sufﬁcient. No carry over was detected.
Statistics
Fisher exact tests were performed using R version 2.7.1
(http://www.r-project.org). Data are presented as mean  SD
in all ﬁgures where error bars are shown. A level of signiﬁcance
of P < 0.05 was chosen (where mentioned).

Results
Short-term anti-VEGFR/PDGFR treatment induces a
time window of improved blood ﬂow into the tumor
We used the human lung cancer cell line PC9. PTK787
treatment improved tumor blood ﬂow after 4 days of treatment
by 12% (day 0: SD ¼ 7.47, range ¼ 22.42%; day 4: SD ¼ 9.15,
range ¼ 35.04%), as determined by changes of maximal voxel
activity in [15O]H2O PET ([15O]H2O; Fig. 1A, right and B). We
could measure a steady and signiﬁcant increase in tumor blood
ﬂow by 33.58% (day 8: SD ¼ 5.52, range ¼ 34.57%) until day 8 of
treatment with PTK787 (P-value < 0.001) probably mediated by
a transient normalization of vessels followed by a sharp
decrease of 17.23% (day 18: SD ¼ 12.63, range ¼ 48.66%) till
day 18. In contrast, blood ﬂow decreased consistently from day
4 to day 8 by 20.42% (day 0: SD ¼ 4.52, range ¼ 9.39%; day 4: SD

¼ 4.67, range ¼ 8.60%; day 8: SD ¼ 5.58, range ¼ 12.89%), and by
30.75% until day 18 (day 18: SD ¼ 0.63, range ¼ 10.53%) in the
vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 1A, left and B). Simultaneously,
uptake of 30 -deoxy-30 -[18F]-ﬂuoro-L-thymidine, [18F]FLT), a
marker of proliferation (17), was increased by 51.08% from
day 0 to day 4 (day 4: SD ¼ 26.81, range ¼ 527.31%) and by 76%
form day 0 to day 8 (day 8: SD ¼ 44.99, range ¼ 532.67%;
Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C), suggesting that the cells continued to progress through the cell cycle. In concordance with
the [18F]FLT PET data, treatment of H1975 and PC9 cells with
10 or 20 mmol/L PTK787 did not reduce tumor cell proliferation
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E).
To investigate if improvement in blood ﬂow can be also
achieved by using other antiangiogenic agents, we used
ZD6474, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that targets VEGFR2 and
EGFR with additional activity against VEGFR3, VEGFR1,
PDGFRb, and the RET tyrosine kinase. We treated H1975
xenografts with ZD6474, which are resistant to EGFR inhibition
because of the presence of T790M gatekeeper mutation of
EGFR (15). There was an increase in blood ﬂow by 21.39% (day
0: SD ¼ 0.91, range ¼ 10.12%; day 4: SD ¼ 9.23, range ¼ 38.58%,
day 8: SD ¼ 5.82, range ¼ 30.15%) from day 0 to day 8 of ZD6474
treatment followed by a drop of 20.95% from day 0 to day 18.
Vehicle-treated tumors displayed a stable decrease in blood
ﬂow by 8.95% from day 0 to day 8 and by 14.78% on day 18 (SD ¼
4.32, range ¼ 12.11%; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
Proliferation remained unaffected as measured by an increase
in [18F]FLT uptake by 67.1% from day 0 to day 4 (day 4: SD ¼
3.17, range ¼ 193.5%) and by 78.02% form day 0 to day 8 (day 8:
SD ¼ 20.49, range ¼ 675.8%; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
These data indicate that prudent anti-VEGFR/PDGFR treatment produces a short-lived time window of about 7 days when
tumor vessels are transiently normalized, which can be monitored by an increase in blood ﬂow by up to 50% into the tumor.
Short-time antiangiogenic treatment reduces leakiness
and improves pericyte coverage in tumor blood vessels in
xenografts
To elucidate if the improved blood ﬂow into the tumors was
indeed because of vessel normalization, permeability of the
blood vessels were examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy after
tumor-bearing animals were perfused with FITC-dextran.
Blood vessels of vehicle-treated tumors were dilated with
aberrant morphologic pattern and displayed extensive leakiness associated with massive extravasation of FITC-dextran
(Fig. 2A, left and Supplementary Fig. S3C) and correlated with
high expression of CD31 and p-VEGFR2 (Fig. 2A, left). However,
in tumors that were treated with PTK787 for 4 days, blood
vessels showed strikingly reduced leakiness with almost no
extravasation of FITC-dextran (Fig. 2A, right and Supplementary Fig. S3C) supported by 8-fold reduction in signal intensity
(Fig. 2B) accompanied by diminished CD31 and p-VEGFR2
expression. (Fig. 2A, right). Tumor vasculature was characterized by abnormal and discontinuous pericyte lining of vessels
as indicated by arrows on day 0 (Fig. 2C). Antiangiogenic
treatment for 4 days transiently improved pericyte coverage
in contrast to vehicle-treated tumors, which still exhibited
incoherent pericyte coverage (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig.

maturity (Fig. 2C).
Pretreatment with antiangiogenic agents improves
cytotoxic therapeutic outcome in NSCLC with enhanced
delivery of erlotinib into the tumor
In the next step, we investigated if augmented blood ﬂow
induced by short-term antiangiogenic treatment had any
improved therapeutic efﬁcacy in NSCLC. Mice bearing
macroscopic PC9 tumors were treated by an oral gavage
of PTK787 (75 mg/kg daily) for 1 week. Because [15O]H2O
PET data indicated that tumor blood ﬂow improves within a

time window of 7 days of antiangiogenic therapy, erlotinib
treatment was started within this "normalization window"
from day 4 onward and continued as monotherapy for 13
days. Mice receiving erlotinib therapy pretreated with
PTK787 had a sharp initial increase in tumor volume from
100% on day 1 to 221.28% (SD ¼ 27.09, range ¼ 162%) on day
4 followed by a massive reduction to 45.63% (SD ¼ 7.11,
range ¼ 6.9%) on day 7, and ﬁnally almost complete
shrinkage of tumor after 16 days of treatment (9.14% (SD
¼ 3.2, range ¼ 7.2%) of original mass left; Fig. 3A). Erlotinib
as monotherapy restricted tumor proliferation, resulting in
a slow reduction (up to 50% of tumor mass), but not as
strong as with intermittent PTK787 treatment (P-value <

vehicle treatment (with an increase from 100% on day 1 to
245% and 220% (SD ¼ 17.9, range ¼ 38.8%) respectively on
day 4; Fig. 3A).
To check if the normalized blood vessels were effectively
delivering drugs into the tumors, we measured erlotinib concentration within the tumor via mass-spectrometric analysis.
Under monotherapy with erlotinib, there was a slight improvement of the drug uptake into the tumor from day 1 (start of
treatment) to day 4 by 20% (SD ¼ 5.2, range ¼ 34.16%; Fig. 3B).
In contrast, tumors pretreated with PTK787 for 4 days displayed an increased erlotinib uptake by 140% (SD ¼ 10.56,
range ¼ 35.64%) on the ﬁrst day of erlotinib treatment (day 4),
which improved up to 160% (SD ¼ 11.04, range ¼ 25.64%) on

range ¼ 23.72) on day 8 (Fig. 3B).
Western blot analysis of lysates from tumors treated with
PTK787 and erlotinib showed an overtime decrease in pEGFR
signal from day 1 to day 4 of treatment corresponding to pAKT
and pERK levels (Fig. 3C). There was no change in signal
intensity of pEGFR, pAKT, or pERK in the vehicle or monotherapy sets (PTK787 alone or erlotinib alone; Fig. 3C). Western
blot analysis results correlated with histology where Ki67positive cells were dramatically reduced in PTK787 pretreated
tumors receiving erlotinib on day 1 compared with tumors
receiving erlotinib as monotherapy on day 1 (Supplementary

showed complete inhibition of pAKT from day 0 to day 4 in

levels remain inhibited on day 8 with induction of necrosis (Fig.

pretreated with PTK787 were treated with phosphoinositide 3kinase inhibitor GDC0941. Tumors receiving GDC0941 therapy
pretreated with PTK787 receded by 50% (SD ¼ 4.7, range ¼
10.07) more than 28 days compared with just a mild growth
inhibition observed in GDC0941 monotherapy sets, which
tumor volumes surpassed by 250% (SD ¼ 10.41, range ¼
22,10) on day 22 (Fig. 4A).
Intermittent antiangiogenic treatment facilitates longterm tumor regression
A long-term xenograft study with subcutaneous PC9 tumors
was performed where mice were treated with a continuous
dose of erlotinib combined with a short PTK787 treatment
every 10 days. Tumors remained regressed in this combination

model over the entire time span of 65 days (Fig. 4B). However,
in mice treated with erlotinib only, there was an initial tumor
regression up to 40% of original tumor volume until day 22
followed by a stable disease (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
Using in vivo PET imaging we demonstrate that transient
antiangiogenic treatment using PTK787 improves tumor blood
ﬂow in vivo. This transient tumor vessel normalization results
in an improved delivery of targeted compounds such as

erlotinib into the tumor. Most strikingly, enhanced availability
and distribution of erlotinib within the tumor induced by
transient PTK787 treatment was followed by a signiﬁcant
increase in tumor shrinkage. This improvement in tumor
response is consistent with recent ﬁndings demonstrating that
high-dose EGFR-targeted drug exposure results in more efﬁcient target inhibition (18).
Several mechanisms have been described as potential
targets to improve the function of tumor vessels. Recently,
Chakroborty and colleagues described Dopamine as a potential drug to improve the function of tumor vessels. The

Improving Drug Delivery by Tumor Vessel Normalization

normalization effect was mainly mediated by an upregulation of angiopoetin-1 and the Kr€
uppel-like factor 2 (19).
Similarly, treatment with the Cox-2 inhibitor apricoxib
increased the maturity of tumor vessel in vivo (20). In line
with our ﬁndings this vascular normalization effect was
associated with a signiﬁcantly enhanced efﬁcacy of gemcitabine plus erlotinib (21). Tumor vessel normalization upon
apricoxib treatment was primarily induced by a transient
reduction in VEGF secretion within the tumor in vivo. Of
note, the tumor vessel normalization effect was time and
dose dependent (20). Rakesh Jain recently reported that the
tumor vessel normalization effect induced by inhibition of
the VEGF-VEGFR2 axis is time and dose dependent (22, 23).
We applied [15O]H2O PET imaging to decipher this timedependent tumor vessel normalization effect. In line with
the tumor vessel normalization hypothesis, tumor blood
ﬂow increased within the ﬁrst 8 days of PTK787 treatment
but again declined till day 18 of treatment accompanied by a
decrease in pericyte coverage (19, 24). Thus, our data
strongly indicate that tumor vessel normalization induced
by PTK787 is time dependent. We found similar results with
ZD6474, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that primarily targets
EGFR and VEGFR2 (13). As we applied H1975 xenografts that
are resistant to EGFR treatment, the ZD6474 induced effect
on the tumor vasculature seems to be mainly driven by
inhibition of VEGFR2. Similarly, Huang and colleagues found
that low-dose treatment with an anti-VEGFR2-antibody
(DC101) results in an increase in pericyte coverage in a
breast cancer in vivo model (25). These and our data indicate
that the primary target to induce tumor vessel normalization is most probably VEGFR2. However, further investigations are required to decipher in detail the responsible
tyrosine kinases that drive tumor vessel normalization.
In our study the implication of [15O]H2O-PET–guided use
of PTK787 and ZD6474 treatment signiﬁcantly improved the
delivery of the cytotoxic compounds erlotinib and GDC0941.
[15O]H2O PET has been already successfully applied in patients
with human lung cancer (26). Thus, [15O]H2O PET reﬂects a
highly accurate method that can easily be translated into
clinical application. The implementation of [15O]H2O PET
enables to establish combined antiangiogenic and cytotoxic
PET-guided treatment protocols in individual patients to
improve the delivery of cytotoxic compounds.
Cytotoxic agents combined with antiangiogenic therapy has
shown only little efﬁcacy in patients with advanced stage
NSCLC. In a recent phase III trial, the addition of bevacizumab

to chemotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma did not
improve overall survival (27). In a recent human study, docetaxel uptake was reduced in NSCLC after patients were
administered with bevacizumab (28). These data indicate that
inhibition of VEGF potentially bears an antivascular than
tumor vessel normalization effect supporting the notion that
scheduling and dosing of the antiangiogenic treatment is
essential to induce and maintain tumor vessel normalization.
This is also conﬁrmed by our PET data as the vascular
normalization effect seems to be transient as continuous
treatment with PTK787 or ZD6474 result in a reduction in
tumor ﬂow after more than 8 days of treatment. Our data
strengthen the use of [15O]H2O PET in clinical studies to deﬁne
the optimal dose and schedule of antiangiogenic drugs such as
bevacizumab and PTK787 to improve the delivery of cytotoxic
drugs in to the tumor.
In summary, our ﬁndings are consistent with the vascular
normalization hypothesis and are indicative of the fact that
prudent antiangiogenic therapy leads to evanescent vessel
normalization, resulting in better cytotoxic therapeutic outcome. However, optimal designs of drug scheduling and efﬁcient imaging techniques are absolutely indispensable to
achieve maximal clinical outcome.
