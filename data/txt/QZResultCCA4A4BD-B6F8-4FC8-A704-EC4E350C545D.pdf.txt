Mutations after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast
Cancer

Abstract
We investigated the loss of somatic mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA in breast cancer tissue after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NCT) and the clinical relevance of the observed mutation proﬁles. Samples were derived from
three cohorts: Cohort 1 consisting of 206 patients undergoing NCT with matched pre- and postchemotherapy
tumor tissues; Cohort 2 consisting of 158 additional patients undergoing NCT; and Cohort 3, consisting of 81
patients undergoing chemotherapy with prechemotherapy tumor tissues. In the ﬁrst cohort, somatic mutations
in TP53 or PIK3CA were identiﬁed in 24.8% of the pre-NCT tumor samples but in only 12.1% of the post-NCT tumor
samples (P < 0.001). Patients with initial TP53 and PIK3CA mutations who became negative for the mutations after
NCT had a higher Miller–Payne score (P ¼ 0.008), improved disease-free survival, and improved overall survival
than those with no change or the opposite change. The association of loss of mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA and
improved survival was successfully validated in the second cohort. In addition, 28.4% of the tumors showed
intratumoral heterogeneity of somatic mutations in TP53 or PIK3CA, whereas 71.6% were homogeneous, either
with or without the mutations. Our data reveal the novel concept that chemotherapy may reduce mutation
frequency in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the loss of somatic mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA may be
translated to biomarkers for prognosis via further veriﬁcation, which may optimize the choice of sequential
therapy and improve patient survival. Cancer Res; 74(13); 3399–407. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) provides an opportunity
to record breast cancer phenotype in a setting where both preand postchemotherapy samples can be obtained and the
response to chemotherapy can be documented (1). It is of
considerable importance to elucidate genetic changes and to
identify prognostic biomarkers associated with NCT, which
can provide a more accurate assessment of individual treatment. The altered gene expression proﬁles of breast cancer
under NCT have been described (2–4). However, to the best of
our knowledge, a comparison of the exomes and genomes of
pre- and post-NCT samples does not yet exist. We hypothesized that mutation shift might occur in breast tumors during

NCT, and a comparison of the exomes of pre- and post-NCT
samples might reveal genetic alterations associated with
prognosis.
Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (e.g., whole
genome sequencing and exome sequencing) provide further
opportunities to more completely characterize the molecular
architecture of breast cancer (5, 6). Integrated molecular
analyses of breast cancer have revealed that TP53 and PIK3CA
are the most frequently mutated genes, each with a mutation
frequency >35% (7). Using exome sequencing, we revealed that
breast cancers might undergo loss of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations after NCT. This study investigates the loss of TP53 and
PIK3CA mutations after NCT and its clinical relevance. This
phenomenon, in turn, may serve as prognostic biomarkers and
optimize the choice of sequential therapy.

and had residual invasive tumors in the operated breast. In
the ﬁrst cohort, patients were treated at FUSCC between
January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2006. In the second cohort
for validation of the ﬁndings from the ﬁrst cohort, patients
were treated between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2009.
Of the 242 patients who were originally enrolled in the ﬁrst
cohort, 36 patients were considered as pathologic complete
remission (pCR) and excluded from the study. Similarly, 30 of
the 188 patients initially enrolled in the second cohort were
considered pCR and further excluded. As a result, the ﬁrst
cohort consisted of 206 female non-pCR patients with histologically conﬁrmed IDC. The second cohort (the validation
cohort) consisted of 158 female non-pCR patients with IDC.
Matched samples from biopsies and surgical resection
were collected before and after neoadjuvant treatment. Pathologic response was assessed postoperatively using the Miller–
Payne scoring system (8, 9), with grade 5 considered to be pCR
and grade 1 to 4 to be non-pCR. The third cohort consisted
of 81 randomly selected patients with histologically conﬁrmed IDC who had undergone prior surgical resection and
received adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients in the third
cohort were treated at FUSCC between January 1, 2003 and
December 31, 2009.
The molecular subtypes of breast cancer according to
immunohistochemical (IHC) proﬁles were categorized as follows: Luminal A ¼ ER/PRþ, HER2, and Ki67 < 14%; Luminal B
¼ ER/PRþ and HER2þ or Ki67  14%; HER2þ ¼ ER, PR, and
HER2þ; and basal-like ¼ ER, PR, HER2, and CK5/6þ or
EGFRþ (10, 11). Tumors with IHC phenotypes of ER, PR,
HER2, CK5/6, and EGFR were excluded. The staining and
the interpretation of ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67, CK5/6, and EGFR
have been previously described (10, 12). The clinicopathologic
characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1.
Follow-up for patients in the three cohorts was completed
on December 31, 2013. The median length of follow-up was
63 months (range, 5–97 months) in the ﬁrst cohort, 42
months (range, 4–82 months) in the second cohort, and
64 months (range, 5–106 months) in the third cohort. Our
deﬁnition of disease-free survival (DFS) events included: the
ﬁrst recurrence of disease at a local, regional, or distant site,
the diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer, and death
from any causes (13). The overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last
follow-up. Patients without events or death were censored at
the last follow-up. This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of FUSCC, and each participant signed an
informed consent document.
Sample collection and processing
Tumor samples and paired blood samples were obtained
from patients undergoing surgical treatment at FUSCC in
accordance with the appropriate institutional review boards.
For the ﬁrst and second cohorts, tumor tissues were macrodissected to avoid the inﬂuence of stromal tissues (<10%). For
each case in the third cohort, one section 15 mm in thickness
was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and microdissected
using the AS Laser Microdissection system (Leica Microsystems). In total, 30 to 40 tumor foci, each containing approx-

3400

imately 100 cancer cells, were obtained. QIAamp DNA Mini
Kits (Qiagen) were used to extract DNA from the tissues. The
quality and concentration of the extracted DNA were determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The
extracted DNA was then used for mutation analysis.
Exome capture and sequencing
DNA extracted from tumor samples and paired blood samples were sent to Beijing Genomics Institute-Shenzhen for
exome sequencing as described previously (14–17). Exome
capture was done using the SureSelect Human All Exon Kit
(Agilent), guided by the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, the
qualiﬁed genomic DNA samples were randomly fragmented to
200 to 500 bp, followed by end-repair, A-tailing, and paired-end
index adapter ligation. Final libraries were validated by Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent) and quantitative PCR. Each captured
library was loaded on the Hiseq 2000 platform and paired-end
sequencing was performed with read lengths of 90 bp, providing at least 100-fold average depth for each sample. SOAPaligner 2.20 (18) was used to align the reads to human
reference hg19 with parameters set to "-a -b -D -o -v 2 -r 1
-t -n 4." Reads that aligned to the designed target region were
collected for single nucleotide variation (SNV) identiﬁcation
and subsequent analysis. For SNV calling, the Variant Quality
Score Recalibration method was applied to estimate the probability that each variant is a true genetic variant or a machine
artifact. For indel calling, Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA,
V.0.5.8) was used to gap align the sequence reads to the human
reference hg19. GATK IndelRealigner was used to perform local
realignment of the BWA-aligned reads and GATK IndelGentotyperV2 was used to call indels. The variants were functionally annotated and were subsequently categorized into missense, nonsense, read-through, or splice-site mutations and
coding indels, which are likely to be deleterious compared with
synonymous and noncoding mutations.
Mutation analysis
The detection of mutations in frozen tumor tissues and
paired blood DNA was performed by Sanger sequencing of all
exons of TP53 and PIK3CA. PCR ampliﬁcation was performed
on an ABI 9700 Thermal Cycler using standard conditions.
After ampliﬁcation, the products were puriﬁed using a QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced
using an ABI PRISM 3730 Automated Sequencer (Invitrogen).
PCR products were directly sequenced in forward and reverse
directions. Detected mutations were conﬁrmed by resequencing of tumor and matched normal blood DNA from new PCR
product.
Pyrosequencing, a more sensitive method, was applied to
quantitatively re-evaluate the cases with loss of TP53 or PIK3CA
mutation after NCT as described previously (19, 20). Allele
frequencies were outputted as relative percentages using the
Biotage PSQ software.
Statistical analysis
Frequency tabulation and summary statistics were provided to characterize the data distribution. Student t test
was used to compare continuous variables. To determine the

combination of TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status, we
deﬁned the variable "TP53 and PIK3CA status." The "TP53
and PIK3CA status" was considered wild-type only when
neither TP53 nor PIK3CA mutation was detected; otherwise,
it was classiﬁed as mutant. The McNemar test was applied to
compare the change in mutation status following the treatment. The Cochran–Armitage trend test was used to test
whether a change in mutation status was associated with
clinical outcome in terms of the Miller–Payne Score. Survival
curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method,
and the univariate survival difference was determined
with the log-rank test. Adjusted HRs with 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional
hazards models. All statistical analyses were performed
using Stata statistical software, version 10.0 (StataCorp). A
two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Exome sequencing in two cases for somatic mutation
identiﬁcation
We performed exome sequencing to examine the exomes
(100-fold coverage) of two paired samples (pretreatment biopsies and posttreatment tumors), which were separate from the
following cohorts. One pair (P1) was from a 62-year-old Chinese woman, and the other (P2) was from a 58-year-old Chinese
woman, both of whom were diagnosed with histologically
conﬁrmed IDC and received four cycles of NCT (paclitaxel
and carboplatin) before undergoing mastectomy (21, 22). Each
had an approximately 50% reduction in bidimensionally measurable tumor diameter after NCT. Matched samples from
biopsies and surgical resection were collected before and after
NCT. Tumors were conﬁrmed as basal-like with IHC phenotypes of ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6þ, and EGFRþ by two
independent pathologists in the Department of Pathology at
FUSCC.

By comparing pre- and posttreatment tumor tissues, we
identiﬁed 23 somatic SNVs in P1 and P2 (Supplementary Table
S1). Among these variations, we identiﬁed and validated TP53
(c.C298T) and PIK3CA (c.A3140G) as signiﬁcantly mutated
genes only in the pretreatment tumors, not in the paired
posttreatment samples, suggesting that TP53 and PIK3CA
mutations might be lost in breast cancer after NCT. TP53 and
PIK3CA have been identiﬁed as the most frequently mutated
genes in breast cancer, each with a mutation frequency >35%
(7). Thus, we supposed that loss of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations
might be a common phenomenon after NCT.
TP53 and PIK3CA mutation shift in tumor tissues before
and after NCT
We assessed the change in TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status
in the ﬁrst and second cohorts. In pretreatment tumor samples, the frequency of TP53 mutations was higher in both
HER2þ and basal-like breast cancer, and PIK3CA mutations
were basically associated with Luminal A, Luminal B, and
HER2þ status (Supplementary Fig. S1). This was in concordance with the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA;
ref. 7) and gave conﬁdence to the surrogate molecular subtyping using IHC markers. Both in Cohort 1 and 2, four patients
had both PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in the pre-NCT samples,
and two patients had both PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in the
post-NCT samples. PIK3CA and TP53 mutations are not mutually exclusive in either cohort (Supplementary Table S2, Fisher
exact test; in the ﬁrst cohort, P ¼ 0.769 for pre-NCT and P ¼
0.217 for post-NCT; in the second cohort, P ¼ 0.749 for pre-NCT
and P ¼ 0.169 for post-NCT). All TP53 and PIK3CA somatic
mutations identiﬁed before and after NCT are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
In the ﬁrst cohort, 51 patients (24.8%) had TP53 or PIK3CA
mutations before NCT; this decreased to 25 (12.1%) after
treatment (Fig. 1A). Supplementary Figure S2 indicated high
viable tumor cellularity in the post-NCT tumors where

mutation loss occurred. We also reanalyzed the DNA samples
from which mutation loss occurred using pyrosequencing, a
more sensitive method, to quantitatively examine the loss of
mutations. Compared with pretreatment samples, the posttreatment tumors with loss of PIK3CA or TP53 mutations had
signiﬁcantly decreased frequency (<10%) of mutant alleles
(Supplementary Fig. S3). A total of 160 patients (77.7%)
retained their initial status [145 wild-type (WT), 15 mutant
(MT)]; 10 patients (4.8%) had a WT-to-MT change, and 36
patients (17.5%) had an MT-to-WT change. In the second
cohort for validation, 42 patients (26.6%) had TP53 or PIK3CA
mutations before NCT; this decreased to 20 (12.7%) after
treatment (Fig. 1B). Eight patients (5.1%) had a WT-to-MT
change, and 30 patients (19.0%) had an MT-to-WT change; the
remaining 120 patients (75.9%) retained their initial status (108
WT, 12 MT). The decrease in mutation rate after chemotherapy
was statistically signiﬁcant in both cohorts (P < 0.001; McNemar test for both cohorts). Taken together, these results
suggest that loss of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations is common
in breast cancer tissues after NCT.
We then evaluated the change in TP53 and PIK3CA mutation
status separately (Supplementary Table S4 for the ﬁrst cohort
and Supplementary Table S5 for the second cohort). For TP53
mutations, the McNemar test revealed that the decrease in the
mutation rate after chemotherapy was statistically signiﬁcant
in both cohorts (P ¼ 0.013 for the ﬁrst cohort and P ¼ 0.035 for
the second cohort). For PIK3CA mutations, a similar decrease
in the mutation rate was also observed (P ¼ 0.016 for the ﬁrst
cohort and P ¼ 0.019 for the second cohort). Moreover,
molecular subtype was not signiﬁcantly associated with
changes in TP53 and PIK3CA mutations (Supplementary Table
S6, P ¼ 0.902 for the ﬁrst cohort and P ¼ 0.915 for the second
cohort). However, when separately analyzed, HER2þ and basallike tumors were associated with a higher rate of TP53 mutation loss (Supplementary Table S7, P ¼ 0.018) in the ﬁrst
cohort, but this was not successfully validated in the second

cohort (Supplementary Table S7, P ¼ 0.178). Molecular subtype
was not signiﬁcantly associated with PIK3CA mutation loss
(Supplementary Table S8, P ¼ 0.257 for the ﬁrst cohort and
P ¼ 0.404 for the second cohort).
Inﬂuence of mutation shift on tumor response to NCT
We investigated the effect of mutation loss on tumor
response to NCT. Patients with Miller–Payne grade 5 (recognized as pCR) were initially excluded from this study because
they had no residual cancer tissue after NCT for analysis. NonpCR patients were divided into four groups: MT-to-WT, WT-toWT, MT-to-MT, and WT-to-MT. In the ﬁrst cohort, 106 (51.4%)
had signiﬁcant pathologic partial responses (PR) deﬁned as
Miller–Payne grade 3 or 4 (Table 2). In the second cohort, 89
(56.3%) had signiﬁcant PRs after NCT. Loss of mutation
was signiﬁcantly associated with a better pathologic response
(P < 0.001 for both the ﬁrst cohort and second cohort;
Cochran–Armitage trend test). In addition, we examined the
inﬂuence of TP53 (Supplementary Table S9) or PIK3CA (Supplementary Table S10) mutation loss separately on tumor
response to NCT. Loss of TP53 mutation was signiﬁcantly
associated with better clinical response (P < 0.001 for the ﬁrst
cohort and P ¼ 0.001 for the second cohort; Cochran–Armitage
trend test). Loss of PIK3CA mutation was also signiﬁcantly
associated with a better pathologic response (P ¼ 0.001 for the
ﬁrst cohort and P < 0.001 for the second cohort). These data
reveal that loss of the TP53 and PIK3CA mutations is associated
with improved clinical response to NCT.
Inﬂuence of mutation shift on patient survival
We further questioned whether the loss of these mutations
inﬂuenced DFS and OS. A striking association between loss of
mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA and patient survival was
observed in both cohorts (Fig. 2). Kaplan–Meier plots showed
that mutation change status was associated with DFS (P ¼
0.033) and OS (P ¼ 0.045) in the ﬁrst cohort, and this was likely

To determine the combination of TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status, we deﬁned the variable "TP53 and PIK3CA status." The "TP53

(Supplementary Fig. S4) nor PIK3CA (Supplementary Fig. S5)
mutation loss alone was signiﬁcantly associated with DFS,

which might be attributable to the limited number of cases
with TP53 or PIK3CA mutation loss separately.
Furthermore, we used a multivariate Cox proportional

subtype, pathologic response, and TP53 and PIK3CA status to
identify independent predictors of DFS in these two cohorts
(Table 3). In the ﬁrst cohort, we observed that node status,
pathologic response, PIK3CA status, and TP53 and PIK3CA
mutation status were independent predictors of DFS after
multivariate adjustment (Supplementary Tables S11 and
S12). Compared with the MT-to-WT group, the rest (WT-toWT, WT-to-MT, and MT-to-MT) were signiﬁcantly associated
with worse DFS (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.12–4.88; P ¼ 0.031; Table 3).
In the second cohort, the adjusted multivariate regression
revealed that tumor size, node status, pathologic response,
PIK3CA status, and TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status were
independent predictors of DFS (Supplementary Tables S11 and
S12). The rest (WT-to-WT, WT-to-MT, and MT-to-MT) was
also signiﬁcantly associated with poorer DFS (HR, 1.68; 95% CI,
1.06–3.18; P ¼ 0.042; Table 3) relative to an MT-to-WT change.
Compared with TP53 or PIK3CA status alone, the combination
of TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status was a more robust
independent prognostic factor of DFS in both cohorts. Thus,
loss of mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA is most likely associated
with improved survival.
Intratumoral heterogeneity of mutations in tissue
samples
The phenotype of mutation shift prompted us to investigate
its biologic nature. We further performed genetic heterogeneity
analysis on samples from 81 patients with histologically conﬁrmed IDC who had undergone prior surgical resection and
received chemotherapy. Twenty-two cases were TP53/PIK3CA
mutation positive. Of these 22 cases, a total of 748 tumor foci
were fractionated. Samples from four of the 22 cases consisted
of only MT cells, whereas the other 18 samples consisted of

www.aacrjournals.org

both WT and MT cells. Among the 59 cases identiﬁed in
routine detection as TP53 and PIK3CA WT by Sanger
sequencing, 1,880 tumor foci were fractionated for analysis
of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations. Five of the 59 cases consisted
of both WT and MT cells. Taken together, 28.4% of the
samples (23 of 81) had intratumoral heterogeneity in TP53 or
PIK3CA mutation. In Fig. 3, we present typical images of
tissues with TP53 mutation (p.R175H) and PIK3CA mutation
(p.H1047R) heterogeneity. The remaining 71.6% of the samples (58/81) contained only TP53/PIK3CA mutation–positive
cells or only WT cells. These results reveal high intratumoral
heterogeneity of TP53 and PIK3CA in prechemotherapy
tumors and partially explain the genetic basis of mutation
shift after chemotherapy.

Discussion
To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to suggest that
NCT inﬂuences mutation status in tissue samples and to
demonstrate that signiﬁcant loss of mutations in TP53 and
PIK3CA can occur during NCT. We highlighted the positive
prognostic impact of loss of mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA
under NCT in breast cancer. The decreases in the TP53 and
PIK3CA mutation rates were signiﬁcantly associated with
better pathologic response (higher Miller–Payne score) and
improved survival.
Compared with data released by TCGA (7), our data showed
lower mutation rates and different mutation spectra of TP53
and PIK3CA in the pretreatment tumors in Chinese population,
indicating that there might be some difference in the mutational evolution of breast cancer in different populations. Since
few Asian (or Chinese) patients were included in the TCGA

cohort, it does raise the question of ethnic diversity for future
research. As previously reported, the mutation rates and spectra
of TP53 and PIK3CA are quite different among different
populations. For PIK3CA mutations in Chinese population,
the mutation rates were 12.3% (7/57) reported by Wang and
colleagues (23) and 7.5% (9/120) reported by Tong and
colleagues (24). For TP53 mutations, the frequency of mutation reported by Hao and colleagues (25) was 22.7% (10/44),
which was consistent with the results from Fukushima and
colleagues (26), who reported 20.0% (10/50) of the tumors
harboring TP53 mutations in the Japanese population. Furthermore, the strength of our study is the reproducibility of
the ﬁnding in an independent validation sample set. Taken
together, our ﬁndings, which were in accordance with the
previous reports by other Chinese or Asian investigators,
revealed unique mutation rates and spectra of TP53 and
PIK3CA in Chinese population.
The shift in tumors from mutation status to wild-type status
observed in this study suggests that both mutant and nonmutant cancer cells coexist in the same tumor. To identify
intratumoral heterogeneity, we microdissected and analyzed
mutation status in more than 2,500 tumor foci of 81 tumors
from patients with IDC who underwent prior surgery before
chemotherapy, and 28.4% of tumors contained both mutant
and wild-type foci. These ﬁndings are in accordance with the
previous reports by Hernandez and colleagues (27) and
Kalinsky and colleagues (28).
TP53 and PIK3CA are the most commonly mutated genes,
and they play pivotal roles in the biology of breast cancer (7).
The p53 tumor suppressor protein (encoded by TP53) is
involved in the cell cycle, checkpoint control, repair of DNA
damage, and apoptosis (29–31). PIK3CA, encoding the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, regulates cell
survival, apoptosis, proliferation, motility, growth, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (32–34). Notably, the majority of
mutation changes after chemotherapy were from mutant
status to wild-type, suggesting that cancer cells harboring
certain TP53 and PIK3CA mutations might be more sensitive
to chemotherapy than those without mutation. We further
analyzed the relationships between the shift of mutation
status and tumor response to NCT. We found that patients
with a MT-to-WT shift in TP53 and PIK3CA status were more
likely to achieve a high Miller–Payne score after chemotherapy; they also had higher DFS rate relative to patients with
no change or the opposite change. When considered with
previous studies (35, 36), our investigation suggests that
mutation shift may be related to the heterogeneity of intratumoral mutations and to different chemosensitivity levels
of mutant and wild-type cells. Both mutant and wild-type
cancer cells coexist in untreated tumors with TP53 or
PIK3CA mutations. For patients who had loss of mutations
after NCT, we hypothesize that their cancer cells with
certain TP53 or PIK3CA driver mutations might be sensitive
to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, cytotoxic therapy
would primarily remove the mutant cells and consequently
shift the evolutionary landscape in favor of the nonmutant
subclones. Thus, when analyzing the residual tumors using
Sanger sequencing, the percentage of mutant alleles would

3406

Cancer Res; 74(13) July 1, 2014

be too low to detect, and the genotypes of the tumors would
be considered to have changed from MT to WT. These
patients generally had smaller residual tumors, beneﬁted
more from adjuvant chemotherapy and had relatively favorable prognosis. In contrast, for patients who underwent MTto-MT change or WT-to-MT change after NCT, their cancer
cells with TP53 or PIK3CA driver mutations might be resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. In the residual tumors, the
mutant alleles would remain or become enriched. Consequently, these patients beneﬁted less from chemotherapy
and had relatively poor prognosis. Interestingly, in the third
cohort, ﬁve patients (6.2%) had a low frequency and abundance of TP53/PIK3CA mutations, which were detected only
through microsamples, thus explaining in part why the
mutation status of some patients shifted from negative to
positive after chemotherapy.
One of the limitations of the current study is the lack of
sufﬁcient pre-NCT tumor tissue for microdissection and
mutation analysis. We therefore used the third cohort for
the analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity of TP53 and
PIK3CA mutations, and the results from the three interconnecting cohorts provide a solid foundation to support our
conclusions. In addition, more research is required to elucidate the mechanism by which loss of mutations in TP53
and PIK3CA regulates chemosensitivity. The regimen used in
these patients was a combination of taxanes and platinum.
In fact, both taxanes (mitotic inhibitors and antimicrotubule
agents) and platinum (DNA-damaging agents) might be
relevant for the mutation loss. However, the precise mechanism of mutation loss is beyond the current study. Further
studies are warranted to explore molecular mechanisms
resulting in the chemotherapy-related loss of mutations in
TP53 and PIK3CA.
In conclusion, chemotherapy may affect somatic mutation status in patients with breast cancer, lowering the
number of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations. This may be
attributable to the heterogeneity of intratumoral mutations
and the different sensitivities of mutant and wild-type
tumor cells to chemotherapy. These ﬁndings might help to
optimize the choice of sequential therapy and improve
patient survival. To enable the selection of the most effective therapeutic option, additional preclinical and clinical
studies based on our ﬁndings are needed to further examine
drug resistance mechanisms and to validate our ﬁndings in
other independent cohorts.
