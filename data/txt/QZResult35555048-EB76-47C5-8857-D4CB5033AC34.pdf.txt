protein which helps position Pol II along the transcription
start site of p53-responsive promoters. Development of
this new methodology, together with identification of
these compounds as transcriptional inhibitors, will pave
the way toward providing mechanistic insight into cause
and treatment of disease.
The p53 tumor suppressor protein promotes
longevity by reducing somatic mutations or the survival
and proliferation of mutant cells [4]. Almost all human
cancers contain impairments in the p53 signaling pathway.
Currently, intense focus centers on understanding how
p53 chooses which of its multiple target genes to activate
or repress in response to a given stress. A potential source
enabling the diverse functions of p53 lies within the core
promoter regions of its target genes [5]. The core promoter,
where transcription is initiated, contains conserved motifs
such as TATA box, initiator (INR), TFIIB recognition
element (BRE), down-stream promoter element (DPE)
and down-stream core element (DCE) (Figure 2) [6].
Morachis et al. analyzed the impact of multiple kinase

Transcriptional regulation by RNA polymerase II
(RNA Pol II) is a highly regulated process involving the
action of multiple transcription factors that collectively
regulate synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA). These
complexes sit atop core promoter regions of DNA
composed of sequence motifs that mark the starting
point of transcription [1]. Studies have shown that the
transcriptional machinery is capable of sensing changes in
cellular stress levels and directing cell fate by modulating
production of genes involved in cell cycle regulation
[2]. Very few molecules are capable of directly targeting
transcription, making this an area of intense therapeutic
interest. In this issue of Oncotarget, Morachis et al.
describe identification of three distinct drugs that inhibit
mRNA synthesis [3]. Surprisingly, these drugs, Hypericin,
Rottlerin, and SP600125 (Figure 1), are kinase inhibitors
that impair transcription initiation by targeting components
of the Pol II pre-initiation complex. A common target of
these compounds is the inhibition of the TATA binding

and one of the principle ingrediants in Saint John’s wort. Rottlerin is extracted from the Kamala plant Mallotus philippinensis, and is a widelyused selective inhibitor of protein kinase C. SP600125 is inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

is achieved by the ability of p53 to establish markedly
different affinities of Poll II on its diverse target promoters
and recruit transcriptional initiation components in a
stress-specific manner. It will be important to determine
how p53 directs the recruitment of Poll II and specific
cofactors to its diverse target promoters before and after
stress to generate the appropriate transcriptional response
and how this process fails in human cancers.

inhibitors on RNA transcriptional activity along three p53
target gene core regulatory elements using transcription
and electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) assays. And,
while other drugs such as Flavopiridol were shown to
abolish transcription during the elongation phase [7], this
study reports that Hypericin, Rottlerin, and SP600125
inhibit modification of the TATA Binding Protein (TBP)
during the initial phase of transcription. Importantly, the
study further determines that the three compounds inhibit
TBP phosphorylation on both TATA box-containing and
TATA-less promoters. A previous study demonstrated that
yeast TBP could be phosphorylated by the protein kinase
CK2, thus reducing its affinity to the TATA element [8],
thus offering a potential mechanism of action. In summary,
these findings add to the limited toolbox available to
scientists studying transcriptional regulation and may
aid in development of new therapeutic candidates to treat
disease.
The same group has recently demonstrated that
p53 target promoters are structurally diverse and
display pronounced differences in Poll II occupancy [9].
Their studies reveal that, far from being a latent tumor
suppressor, p53 functions in a temporal manner to regulate
promoter activity both before and after cellular stress. This

Figure 2: The multi-subunit general transcription apparatus. PIC assembly begins with subunits recognizing the core promoter

elements, followed by coordinated accretion of the complex machinery. TBP binding to the TATA box is an intrinsically slow step, yielding
a long-lived protein–DNA complex. TBP phosphorylation is necessary to enable the complex to move from the initiation (top image) to
the elongation phase of transcription (bottom image). Kinase inhibiting compounds such as Hypericin, Rottlerin, and SP600125, prevent
phosphorylation of TBP thus preventing the Poll II complex from progressing to the elongation phase.
