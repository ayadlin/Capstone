Abstract
Di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) demonstrates
potent anti-cancer activity. We previously demonstrated that 14C-Dp44mT enters and
targets cells through a carrier/receptor-mediated uptake process. Despite structural
similarity, 2-benzoylpyridine 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Bp4eT) and pyridoxal
isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) enter cells via passive diffusion. Considering albumin
alters the uptake of many drugs, we examined the effect of human serum albumin
(HSA) on the cellular uptake of Dp44mT, Bp4eT and PIH. Chelator-HSA binding
studies demonstrated the following order of relative affinity: Bp4eT≈PIH>Dp44mT.
Interestingly, HSA decreased Bp4eT and PIH uptake, potentially due to its high
affinity for the ligands. In contrast, HSA markedly stimulated Dp44mT uptake by
cells, with two saturable uptake mechanisms identified. The first mechanism saturated
at 5-10 µM (Bmax:1.20±0.04 × 107 molecules/cell; Kd:33±3 µM) and was consistent
with a previously identified Dp44mT receptor/carrier. The second mechanism was
of lower affinity, but higher capacity (Bmax:2.90±0.12 × 107 molecules/cell; Kd:65±6
µM), becoming saturated at 100 µM and was only evident in the presence of HSA.
This second saturable Dp44mT uptake process was inhibited by excess HSA and had
characteristics suggesting it was mediated by a specific binding site. Significantly,
the HSA-mediated increase in the targeting of Dp44mT to cancer cells potentiated
apoptosis and could be important for enhancing efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

Conversely, albumin has also been demonstrated to
aid the uptake and targeting of albumin-bound molecules,
including fatty acids [5, 10, 11]. Studies have suggested
that, upon binding to the cell membrane, albumin
undergoes a conformational change, which subsequently
results in the release of albumin-bound fatty acids [5,
11]. The release of the fatty acids in the vicinity of the
membrane potentiates the delivery of these molecules to
their receptor for cellular uptake [5, 11]. The subsequent
reduced affinity of albumin for the cell surface then allows

Various exogenous compounds, including drugs
such as warfarin [1], chlorpromazine [2], digitoxin [2]
and ibuprofen [2], as well as endogenous molecules,
such as fatty acids [3], steroids [4, 5] and inorganic ions
[5, 6], bind extensively to albumin. In general, drugprotein interactions can adversely affect drug delivery by
decreasing free drug levels available to traverse the plasma
membrane to reach intracellular targets [7-9].

mechanism involved in the cellular uptake and targeting
of Dp44mT that is markedly facilitated by human serum
albumin (HSA). Intriguingly, this process is distinct
from Dp44mT’s structurally similar analogs, Bp4eT
and PIH, whose cellular uptake was inhibited by HSA.
Two saturable mechanisms of Dp44mT uptake by cells
were identified. The first uptake mechanism saturated at
5-10 µM, and this observation was consistent with the
previously identified Dp44mT receptor/carrier [34]. In
contrast, the second mechanism of Dp44mT uptake was
a low affinity, high capacity process which saturated at
>100 µM and was only evident in the presence of HSA.
The enhanced uptake of Dp44mT by HSA was identified
in multiple neoplastic cell-types and a normal cell-type.
Moreover, the HSA-mediated increase in Dp44mT uptake
was specific for this protein and was inhibited by excess
HSA. The enhanced cellular targeting of Dp44mT by HSA
potentiated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of
the agent, facilitating its anti-tumor efficacy.

its release from the membrane [5, 11]. This mechanism
has also been described for the cellular uptake of other
albumin-bound molecules, such as testosterone and
tryptophan, demonstrating the biological importance
of albumin in the transport and delivery of a variety of
ligands [5, 12-14].
Interestingly, albumin has been observed to
accumulate within the interstitium of solid tumors [15-17].
This occurs due to the highly permeable tumor vasculature
and the insufficient lymphatic drainage present in tumor
tissue [15-17]. This characteristic is specifically known as
the “enhanced permeability and retention effect” [15-17].
Thiosemicarbazone ligands are anti-cancer agents
that bind metal ions and have shown anti-tumor activity
in numerous investigations in vitro and in vivo, including
many clinical trials [18-22]. As part of a specific strategy
to generate selective and active anti-tumor agents, the di2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazones were developed [18,
19, 23-25]. In particular, the ligand, di-2-pyridylketone
4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT; Fig. 1A)
and its analogs, were shown to have potent in vitro and in
vivo anti-tumor activity [18, 24-26] and to possess marked
anti-metastatic efficacy [27-29]. Additionally, the activity
of Dp44mT was potentiated in drug-resistant cancer cells
[24].
In terms of its mechanism of action, Dp44mT
accumulates within lysosomes, where it forms redoxactive metal complexes [23, 25, 30] that mediate
lysosomal membrane permeabilization to induce apoptosis
[31]. Other modes of action include inhibition of the
rate-limiting step of DNA synthesis that is catalyzed by
ribonucleotide reductase [32] and up-regulation of N-myc
downstream regulated gene 1 [33], resulting in inhibition
of proliferation and metastasis, respectively [24, 26, 27].
Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated
that Dp44mT binds to a saturable receptor/carrier on
a variety of cell-types [34]. Other structurally-related
thiosemicarbazones, such as 2-benzoylpyridine 4-ethyl-3thiosemicarbazone (Bp4eT; Fig. 1A), or aroylhydrazones
(e.g., pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone, PIH; Fig. 1A),
entered cells via a non-saturable mechanism consistent
with passive diffusion [34, 35]. The role of this receptor/
carrier in targeting Dp44mT to cancer cells could be
important for explaining the marked anti-tumor and antimetastatic activity, which markedly surpasses other similar
agents [18, 24-29].
Considering the increased distribution of albumin
in the tumor interstitium and the crucial role of this
protein as a drug shuttle [36], it was critical to evaluate
the interaction between Dp44mT and albumin. In order
to understand the importance of key structural features
of Dp44mT in its uptake, studies were performed in
comparison to the related ligands, Bp4eT and PIH (Fig.
1A), which possess high and low anti-proliferative
activity, respectively [37, 38].
Herein, for the first time, we describe a novel

RESULTS
Fluorescence Quenching of HSA by Chelators
Indicates Direct Ligand-Binding
Fluorescence spectroscopy was initially used to
examine the ability of the ligands to bind HSA (Fig. 1Biiii). It is well known that HSA contains a single tryptophan
(Trp-214) situated in sub-domain IIA that fluoresces upon
excitation at 295 nm [39, 40]. The conformational state of
HSA can influence the exposure of this tryptophan residue,
and thereby affect tryptophan fluorescence [39].
HSA alone had a pronounced fluorescence
maximum at 345 nm (Fig. 1Bi-iii), due to Trp-214 [5].
No minimal intrinsic fluorescence was demonstrated for
Dp44mT, Bp4eT, or PBS alone (Fig. 1Bi, ii). In contrast,
some intrinsic fluorescence was observed for PIH (Fig.
1Biii). The fluorescence intensity of HSA decreased with
increasing concentrations of all the ligands (i.e., A→L;
0-3.67 µM chelator concentrations; see Fig. 1Bi-iii),
indicating the interaction of these agents with HSA.

of its predominantly α-helical structure (Fig. 1Ci-iii)
[41]. In fact, analysis of the secondary structure revealed
67.73% α-helices (Table 1), which is in agreement with
the X-ray crystal structure of HSA [42]. Importantly, no
marked alterations in secondary structure were detected
after incubation with these ligands (Fig. 1Ci-iii), resulting
in similar levels of α-helical secondary structure content
(66.86 – 67.84%; Table 1). Interestingly, minimal levels
of β-sheet content (5.91%; Table 1) were detected and
were not appreciably altered in the presence of the
chelators (5.82-6.02%; Table 1). As previously observed
[43], the chaotrope and positive control for protein
folding, guanidine hydrochloride (GndCl), resulted in the
denaturation of HSA (Fig. 1Ci-iii), as demonstrated by a

decrease in α-helix content to 1.79%, and the simultaneous
increase in β-sheet content to 34.84% (Table 1).
Collectively, these results suggest the ligands, Dp44mT,
Bp4eT and PIH, do not mediate significant changes in the
secondary structure of HSA upon binding.

than 14C-Dp44mT

Further studies were then performed to characterize
the binding of the ligands to HSA using the equilibrium
dialysis technique [44]. In these experiments, a
physiologically-relevant concentration of HSA in the

HSA or BSA (40 mg/mL) was pre-incubated with the 14C-chelators (25 µM) for 2 h/37oC and placed into dialysis sacs and the release of
the 14C-chelators from the dialysis sac into the dialysate was then examined after a 24 h/4oC equilibration period. For competition studies:
(A) HSA (40 mg/mL) was pre-incubated for 2 h/37oC with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled warfarin or ibuprofen (5 mM), or (B) a 20-fold
excess of unlabeled Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH (0.5 mM). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. of at least 3 experiments.

plasma (40 mg/mL; [41, 45]) was pre-incubated with
the 14C-chelators (25 µM) for 2 h/37oC to duplicate
the incubation period used in subsequent experiments
examining uptake of the 14C-ligands by cells. BSA (40
mg/mL) was chosen as a control protein since it possesses
75.6% sequence identity with HSA [5]. These solutions
were then placed into dialysis sacs and the release of the
14
C-chelators from the sac into the dialysate was then
examined after 24 h/4oC to ensure equilibrium (Fig. 2A).
In the absence of protein (i.e., see “control” in
Fig. 2A), dialysis of 14C-ligands was performed against
the buffer-only control and led to the release of ≈ 50%
of each of the 14C-ligands from the dialysis sac into the
dialysate (Fig. 2A). This observation demonstrated
that the incubation period was sufficient to establish
the equilibrium of these low molecular weight ligands
between the dialysis sac and dialysate.
The presence of HSA inside the dialysis sac
resulted in a marked and significant (p<0.001) decrease
in the release of 14C-Dp44mT, 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH
into the dialysate to 22.0 ± 1.0%, 4.0 ± 0.3% and 6.0
± 0.3%, respectively, compared to the relative control
(i.e., control sacs without HSA; Fig. 2A). These results
demonstrated that the 14C-ligands were directly binding
to HSA and being retained in the dialysis sac. Clearly,
HSA retained the 14C-labeled ligands to different extents,
with 14C-Dp44mT binding significantly (p<0.001) less
avidly than either 14C-Bp4eT or 14C-PIH, which bound to
HSA with approximately similar avidity (Fig. 2A). These
findings indicate the relative binding affinity of the ligands
for HSA to be in the following order: 14C-Bp4eT ≈ 14C-PIH
> 14C-Dp44mT (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, BSA (40 mg/mL) also significantly
(p<0.001) decreased the percentage of 14C-Dp44mT,
14
C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH released from the sac to 21 ±
0.5%, 9 ± 0.3% and 39 ± 0.3%, respectively, compared
to control (i.e., control sacs without protein; Fig. 2A).
Further, no significant difference (p>0.05) in the binding
of Dp44mT to either HSA or BSA was evident (Fig. 2A).
These data also demonstrate that Bp4eT and PIH bind
BSA significantly (p<0.001) less avidly relative to HSA.
Considering the HSA-binding described above,
we next examined if the 14C-ligands (25 µM) bind to the
classical drug-binding sites of HSA, namely, Sudlow’s
site I and/or site II [5]. In these studies, a standard
competition protocol was used, whereby HSA (40 mg/
mL) was pre-incubated for 2 h/37oC with a 200-fold
excess of unlabeled warfarin or ibuprofen (5 mM; Fig. 2A)
that bind to Sudlow’s sites I or II, respectively [5]. The
14
C-chelators (25 µM) were then added and the samples
further incubated for 2 h/37oC, followed by a 24 h/4oC
dialysis period. As a control, in the absence of HSA,
equilibrium dialysis of the 14C-ligands for 24 h/4oC was
also performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled
ibuprofen or warfarin.
Irrespective of the excess warfarin or ibuprofen, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

distribution of the 14C-ligands reached equilibrium (i.e.,
the 14C-ligand reached ≈50% in both the dialysis sac and
dialysate) in the absence of HSA (Fig. 2A). In the presence
of ibuprofen or warfarin and HSA, no significant (p>0.05)
alteration in 14C-Dp44mT release from the dialysis sac
occurred when compared to 14C-Dp44mT and HSA alone
(Fig. 2A). These findings suggest that Dp44mT does
not compete effectively with warfarin or ibuprofen at
Sudlow’s site I and II, respectively. Incubating HSA with a
molar excess of warfarin, but not ibuprofen, led to a slight,
albeit significant (p<0.01) increase in 14C-Bp4eT release
from the dialysis sac when compared to HSA alone (Fig.
2A). This observation suggests that 14C-Bp4eT binds to
a limited extent to Sudlow’s site I, or in the vicinity of
this site. More importantly, 14C-PIH release from the HSAcontaining dialysis sac was markedly and significantly
(p<0.001) increased in the presence of an excess of
warfarin or ibuprofen, relative to the incubation of 14C-PIH
with HSA alone (Fig. 2A).
Overall, these data suggest: (1) PIH either directly
competes with warfarin and ibuprofen for Sudlow’s sites
I and II, respectively, or that PIH binds HSA at other
sites that are allosterically modulated by warfarin- or
ibuprofen-binding to HSA; (2) Bp4eT sparingly competes
with warfarin at Sudlow’s site I only; and (3) Dp44mT
does not significantly (p>0.05) compete with warfarin or
ibuprofen.

Competition Experiments Reveal HSA has
Common and/or Interacting Binding Sites for the
Ligands
Competition experiments using equilibrium dialysis
were also used to evaluate if the three 14C-ligands became
bound to a common, or different, site on HSA. Binding
of 14C-Dp44mT, 14C-Bp4eT, or 14C-PIH (25 µM) to HSA
was examined in competition with a 20-fold excess (0.5
mM) of the relevant unlabeled competitor ligand, namely
Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH, which was pre-incubated with
HSA for 2 h/37oC prior to adding the 14C-ligand (Fig.
2B). The unlabeled chelator could only be used at a 20fold excess relative to the 14C-ligand due to their limited
solubility. The solutions were then placed into dialysis
sacs and the release of 14C-ligands from the dialysis sac
into the dialysate examined after 24 h/4oC.
Incubation of HSA with an excess of unlabeled
Bp4eT induced a slight, but significantly (p<0.05)
increased release of 14C-Dp44mT from the dialysis sac
relative to that found in the absence of this unlabeled
ligand (Fig. 2B). This observation suggested competition
between unlabeled Bp4eT and 14C-Dp44mT for a common
HSA-binding region (Fig. 2B). However, no significant
(p>0.05) change in the release of the 14C-label into the
dialysate was evident when an excess of unlabeled PIH
was incubated with 14C-Dp44mT and HSA relative to
10378

Oncotarget

that found when 14C-Dp44mT and HSA were incubated
together (Fig. 2B). Incubation of HSA with unlabeled
Dp44mT or PIH had no significant effect on 14C-Bp4eT
release from HSA (Fig. 2B). However, incubating
HSA with an excess of unlabeled Dp44mT or Bp4eT
significantly (p<0.001-0.05) increased the release of
14
C-PIH from the HSA-containing dialysis sac relative to
that found with HSA alone (Fig. 2B). This latter finding
suggests these drugs possess common binding sites
and inhibit PIH from binding to HSA, or alternatively,
Dp44mT and Bp4eT bind at distant sites which may then
allosterically influence 14C-PIH-binding. In conclusion,
competition experiments revealed that HSA has some
common and/or interacting sites for these ligands.

calculated from the docking simulations [46]. Docking of
the agents at Sudlow’s site I demonstrated the following
GS order: warfarin (GS = -8.40 kcal/mol) > Bp4eT (GS =
-8.15 kcal/mol) > PIH (GS = -8.03 kcal/mol) > Dp44mT
(GS = -7.21 kcal/mol). These data suggest Dp44mT has
the least affinity for Sudlow’s site I. However, the GS
indicates that Bp4eT and PIH have a similar affinity for
Sudlow’s site I. Notably, the GS parameter is an estimate
only, and as the GS values are similar for Bp4eT and PIH,
it should not be used to rank these ligands in terms of
relative binding affinity.

Computational Docking Studies

Ibuprofen, Dp44mT, Bp4eT and PIH were
also virtually docked at Sudlow’s site II of HSA
(Supplementary Fig. 1Bi-iv). In the X-ray structure of
HSA and ibuprofen [47], ibuprofen interacts with Arg410,
Tyr411 and Lys414 via H-bonds. These interactions were
correctly modeled with an additional cation-π interaction
between Arg410 and the phenyl ring of ibuprofen
(Supplementary Fig. 1Bi). PIH formed H-bonds to Arg410
(2.07 Å) and Tyr411 (2.18 Å) through its hydroxymethyl
and hydroxyl groups, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
1Biv). The distal parts of the molecule were mainly
located in a hydrophobic pocket, in a similar fashion to
that of ibuprofen (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1Bi to 1Biv).
Interestingly, while Dp44mT and Bp4eT both bind in the
same putative binding pocket as PIH, a different ligand
orientation was observed. The main interactions were
H-bonds formed from the pyridyl nitrogen acceptor to
Asn391 and cation-π interactions of the second pyridyl
ring with Lys414 (Supplementary Fig. 1Bii-iii).
The GS obtained after docking the ligands at
Sudlow’s site II demonstrated the following order, namely:
ibuprofen (GS = -8.50 kcal/mol) > PIH (GS = -6.0 kcal/
mol) > Bp4eT (GS = -5.0 kcal/mol) > Dp44mT (GS = -4.9
kcal/mol). Again, Dp44mT showed the lowest interaction
with Sudlow’s site II, which was consistent with the lack
of effect of this ligand in competition studies performed
using equilibrium dialysis experiments (Fig. 2A). On the
other hand, PIH showed the highest affinity for Sudlow’s
site II, relative to Bp4eT and Dp44mT, which was
consistent with the dialysis studies assessing competition
with ibuprofen (Fig. 2A).
In conclusion, molecular modeling indicated that
14
C-PIH binds to HSA at both Sudlow’s site I and II,
potentially via H-bonds and this was consistent with the
competition studies with warfarin and ibuprofen in dialysis
experiments (Fig. 2A). Molecular modeling suggested that
14
C-Bp4eT may share these HSA-binding sites, although
in dialysis studies (Fig. 2A), limited competition was
observed with warfarin only, presumably at Sudlow’s site
I. Dp44mT had the weakest interaction with Sudlow’s
site I and II, which was in agreement with its lack of
effect in competition studies with warfarin and ibuprofen,

Docking at Sudlow’s Site II of HSA

Molecular docking studies were then performed
to further characterize the ligand-binding sites on HSA
(Supplementary Fig. 1A-B). Warfarin (Supplementary
Fig. 1Ai) and ibuprofen (Supplementary Fig. 1Bi) were
also docked and complexed to HSA as relevant controls,
considering that their binding to Sudlow’s site I and II,
respectively, are well established [5]. The best docking
poses of warfarin and ibuprofen correctly reproduced the
experimental bioactive conformations with a root mean
squared deviation of less than 1 Å from that of the ligand
pose present in the X-ray structure (PDB code: 2BXD and
2BXG, respectively).

Docking at Sudlow’s Site I of HSA
These simulations docked warfarin, Dp44mT,
Bp4eT and PIH at Sudlow’s site I of HSA (Supplementary
Fig. 1Ai-iv). Both warfarin and PIH made H-bonds with
HSA (Supplementary Fig. 1Ai, iv), whereas Dp44mT
and Bp4eT predominantly made hydrophobic and van
der Waals interactions (Supplementary Fig. 1Aii-iii).
The phenyl ring of warfarin resulted in π–π stacking with
Phe211 and Trp214 and cation-π interactions with Lys199,
which underlie its high binding affinity (Supplementary
Fig. 1Ai). The docking of PIH (Supplementary Fig.
1Aiv) showed H-bonds with Tyr150, Arg222, Arg257
and Ala291. The hydrophobic groups of Dp44mT
(Supplementary Fig. 1Aii) and Bp4eT (Supplementary
Fig. 1Aiii) were favorably enclosed by the hydrophobic
regions on HSA. Interestingly, the orientation of Bp4eT
was flipped compared to Dp44mT when docked into
Sudlow’s site I, despite these two ligands having similar
structures (Fig. 1A). This effect may due to the formation
of a minimum energy conformation by Bp4eT under this
pose [46].

increase in 14C-Dp44mT uptake. Conversely, 14C-Bp4eT
and 14C-PIH uptake was reduced by HSA (40 mg/mL).
These findings correlate with the appreciable binding
affinity of 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH for HSA (Fig. 2A),
resulting in a decrease in 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake
by SK-N-MC cells. Overall, these results indicate HSA
has pronounced differential effects on 14C-ligand uptake
despite their structural similarities (Fig. 1A).

HSA Markedly Increases 14C-Dp44mT Uptake,
But Decreases 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH Uptake
Considering that: (1) these ligands bind to albumin
(Fig. 1B, 2A-B, Supplementary Fig. 1A-B); (2) the high
levels of protein accumulation in the tumor interstitium
due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect [1517]; and (3) the potential influence of protein-drug binding
on drug bioavailability [7], we examined the cellular
targeting and uptake of 14C-Dp44mT, 14C-Bp4eT and
14
C-PIH in the presence and absence of the serum proteins,
HSA, BSA or Tf (Fig. 3A-C).
In these studies, concentrations of apo-Tf and HSA
at 5 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, respectively, were used to
approximate their physiological concentrations in human
plasma [5, 48]. 14C-Ligand uptake was also assessed
relative to Tf at 40 mg/mL, as a direct comparison to
HSA at this concentration. Similarly, HSA was used at 5
mg/mL as a comparison to physiological Tf levels (52).
To examine species-specific differences in terms of the
14
C-ligand interaction with albumin, BSA (40 mg/mL) was
chosen as a control protein due to its homology with HSA
[5]. Studies were initially performed using SK-N-MC cells
that have been well characterized in terms of the uptake
and biological activity of these ligands [24, 35, 37, 38].
Interestingly, 14C-Dp44mT uptake was significantly
(p<0.001-0.05) increased in the presence of HSA (5 mg/
mL and 40 mg/mL) relative to the control (i.e., ligand
alone in control media) at all time points examined (Fig.
3A). In contrast, addition of Tf (5 or 40 mg/mL) or BSA
(40 mg/mL) led to no significant (p>0.05) alteration in
14
C-Dp44mT uptake relative to the control (i.e., proteinfree media) after a 15-120 min incubation (Fig. 3A).
In contrast to the observations with 14C-Dp44mT,
HSA (5 or 40 mg/mL), Tf (40 mg/mL), or BSA (40 mg/
mL), markedly and significantly (p<0.001-0.05) reduced
14
C-Bp4eT uptake by cells relative to the control (i.e.,
ligand alone) at all time points (Fig. 3B). On the other
hand, Tf at 5 mg/mL had no significant (p>0.05) effect
on 14C-Bp4eT uptake (Fig. 3B). As observed for Bp4eT,
14
C-PIH uptake was also significantly (p<0.001-0.05)
reduced by HSA (40 mg/mL) after a 15-120 min incubation
(Fig. 3C). Moreover, 14C-PIH uptake was slightly (p<0.05)
reduced by HSA (5 mg/mL), BSA (40 mg/mL) and Tf (40
mg/mL) after 120 min relative to the control. Conversely,
no overall significant (p>0.05) difference was evident
for 14C-PIH uptake in Tf- containing media (5 mg/mL)
compared to the control (Fig. 3C).
Collectively, the cellular uptake of 14C-Dp44mT
was markedly increased by HSA (40 mg/mL), in contrast
to Tf or BSA at the same concentration. This observation
indicated that HSA, rather than other plasma proteins or
albumin from another species, specifically mediated an

Membrane and Internalized Uptake of
14
C-Dp44mT by Cells are Increased by HSA, while
14
C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH Uptake are Decreased
To determine if HSA altered the cellular distribution
of the 14C-chelators, uptake into the internalized and
membrane (non-internalized) fractions were assessed
after incubation with the general protease, Pronase, using
standard procedures [49-52] (Fig. 3D). HSA significantly
(p<0.001) increased internalized and membrane uptake
of 14C-Dp44mT by cells relative to the control (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, HSA significantly (p<0.001) decreased the
internalized and membrane uptake of 14C-Bp4eT compared
to the control (Fig. 3D). Similarly, incubation of cells with
HSA significantly (p<0.05) decreased internalized 14C-PIH
uptake, while membrane uptake of 14C-PIH was only
slightly reduced (p>0.05). Collectively, HSA increased
the internalized and membrane uptake of 14C-Dp44mT,
while decreasing the internalized and membrane uptake
of 14C-Bp4eT and to a slightly lesser extent 14C-PIH (Fig.
3D).

HSA Markedly Increases 14C-Dp44mT Uptake
as a Function of Temperature and Ligand
Concentration
To elucidate the mechanism involved in HSApotentiated 14C-Dp44mT uptake, the temperature
dependence of this process over a concentration range
(0.1-150 µM) was examined during a 2 h incubation at 4oC
or 37oC in the presence or absence of HSA (40 mg/mL)
using SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 3E). In the absence of HSA,
14
C-Dp44mT uptake at 37oC saturated at approximately
5-10 µM (see inset Fig. 3E), as reported previously,
suggesting the presence of a putative Dp44mT receptor/
carrier [34]. The addition of HSA significantly (p<0.0010.01) increased 14C-Dp44mT uptake at 37oC at ligand
concentrations greater than ≥25 µM (Fig. 3E). Saturation
of the HSA-stimulated uptake mechanism occurred at a
Dp44mT concentration of 100 µM (Fig. 3E). These two
saturation events suggest two different Dp44mT-binding
sites in the presence or absence of HSA.
Examining 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence of
HSA using non-linear regression analysis demonstrated a
high correlation (r2 = 0.97) and resulted in a Bmax value of
2.92 ± 0.12 x 107 molecules/cell (n = 9) and a Kd value

uptake was significantly (p<0.001-0.01) increased in the
presence of HSA (20-100 mg/mL) relative to the control
(i.e., 14C-Dp44mT in the absence of protein; Fig. 3F).
However, after the pronounced increase in 14C-Dp44mT
uptake up to the physiological HSA concentration in
plasma (40 mg/mL), 14C-Dp44mT uptake then decreased
as the HSA concentration increased up to 100 and 250 mg/
mL (Fig. 3F). In fact, at this latter HSA concentration, a
marked and significant (p<0.01) decrease in 14C-Dp44mT
uptake was observed in comparison to physiological HSA
levels (40 mg/mL; Fig. 3F). Thus, it can be speculated
that the decrease in 14C-Dp44mT uptake at higher HSA
concentrations relative to physiological levels may be due
to the ability of excess HSA to compete with 14C-Dp44mTbound HSA for the cellular HSA-binding site.

of 65 ± 6 µM (n = 9). In the absence of HSA, non-linear
regression also indicated a high correlation (r2 = 0.96),
but resulted in a lower Bmax value of 1.20 ± 0.04 x 107
molecules/cell (n = 9) and a lesser Kd value of 33 ± 3 µM
(n = 9). Of relevance, in a previous study using SK-NMC cells under different experimental conditions, a higher
Bmax value (4.28 x 107 molecules of chelator/cell) and a
lower Kd value (2.45 µM) were observed for Dp44mT
uptake in the absence of HSA [34]. These dissimilar
results are probably due to the presence of 10% (v/v) FCS
in the earlier study [34], which is known to affect cellular
metabolism, receptor dynamics and expression [49, 50,
53].
As demonstrated previously in the absence of HSA
[34], 14C-Dp44mT uptake as a function of concentration
was temperature-dependent, with a significant (p<0.001)
decrease in cellular 14C-Dp44mT uptake being observed
at 4oC relative to 37oC at all concentrations (Fig. 3E).
At 37oC, the cell is metabolically active and results in
receptor recycling [51, 54, 55]. Thus, the 14C-ligand
can label receptors at both the plasma membrane and
those cycling intracellularly [51, 54, 55]. In contrast, at
4oC, cells are metabolically inactive, inhibiting receptor
cycling. Thus, only plasma membrane-bound receptors are
labeled with the ligand, leading to a decrease in uptake
relative to that found at 37oC [51, 54, 55].
Notably, 14C-Dp44mT uptake as a function
of concentration in the presence of HSA was also
temperature-dependent. In fact, a significant (p<0.0010.01) decrease in 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence of
HSA was observed at 4oC relative to 37oC at all Dp44mT
concentrations (Fig. 3E). The saturable and temperaturedependent nature of 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence
of HSA suggested a mechanism consistent with a carrier/
receptor-mediated uptake process.

Effect of HSA on 14C-Dp44mT Efflux from Cells
We also investigated the effect of HSA on efflux of
C-Dp44mT (Fig. 3G), as the stimulatory effects of HSA
on intracellular uptake of 14C-Dp44mT (Fig. 3D) could
also be due to its effect on the release of the ligand from
the cell. For example, decreased efflux of 14C-Dp44mT
from cells in the presence of HSA could lead to cellular
accumulation of the ligand. To assess this hypothesis, SKN-MC cells were pre-labeled with 14C-Dp44mT (25 µM)
in the presence or absence of HSA (40 mg/mL) for 2 h at
37oC. To replicate physiological conditions, the cellular
efflux of 14C-Dp44mT was then assessed in the presence of
HSA (40 mg/mL) as a function of time (0-60 min) at 37oC.
The cellular release of 14C-Dp44mT increased with
time and reached a plateau at 30 min, where 74.8 ± 2.3%
of 14C-Dp44mT was released (Fig. 3G). Importantly, the
pre-labeling of cells with 14C-Dp44mT in the presence
of HSA did not significantly (p>0.05) alter the efflux of
14
C-Dp44mT at all time points (Fig. 3G). Performing the
efflux incubation in the absence of HSA also demonstrated
no difference in 14C-Dp44mT release when cells were
labeled in the presence or absence of HSA (data not
shown). In summary, these data indicate that other factors,
besides the efflux of the ligand, were responsible for the
enhanced cellular uptake of 14C-Dp44mT in the presence
of HSA.

Excess Non-Physiological Levels of Unlabeled
HSA Decrease Dp44mT Uptake by Cells
Next, the effect of increasing HSA and BSA
concentrations (20-250 mg/mL) on 14C-Dp44mT uptake
by SK-N-MC cells was examined after 2 h/37oC (Fig.
3F). These studies were performed to determine the
ability of excess HSA levels to compete with and inhibit
the enhanced HSA-mediated uptake of 14C-Dp44mT.
Furthermore, considering BSA (40 mg/mL) did not
increase 14C-Dp44mT uptake (Fig. 3A), relevant control
studies were also performed using the same concentrations
of BSA (20-250 mg/mL; Fig. 3F).
As evident in Fig. 3A, BSA did not significantly
(p>0.05) increase 14C-Dp44mT uptake at all concentrations
tested (Fig. 3F). In fact, BSA (100 mg/mL) significantly
(p<0.01) decreased 14C-Dp44mT uptake to 77 ± 4% of the
control (i.e., 14C-Dp44mT in the absence of protein; Fig.
3F). In contrast, as observed in Fig. 3A and E, 14C-Dp44mT

The Increase in 14C-Dp44mT Uptake Mediated by
HSA is Observed in a Variety of Neoplastic and
Normal Cell-Types
To understand if the increase of 14C-Dp44mT uptake
or inhibition of 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake mediated
by HSA were specific to certain cell-types, 14C-chelator
uptake in the presence and absence of HSA was examined
using a range of cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A-C). The
uptake of the 14C-chelators was examined in a variety of
immortal cancer/transformed cell-types (i.e., SK-N-MC

was examined in the presence and absence of unlabeled
Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH (25 µM; Fig. 4A-B). It was
hypothesized that cellular stress induced by Dp44mT may
increase 125I-HSA-mediated uptake, and thus, potentiate
the transport of the chelator into the cell. In these studies,
the uptake of 125I-HSA (0.001-10 mg/mL) was performed
as a function of concentration after a 2 h/37oC incubation
with SK-N-MC cells in the presence and absence of
Dp44mT (Fig. 4A).
The total uptake of 125I-HSA by SK-N-MC cells
plateaued at approximately 5-7.5 mg/mL and occurred
by a single exponential process, suggesting a saturable
binding site (Bmax: 1.46 ± 0.10 x 107 molecules/cell; Kd:
62 ± 11 µM; Fig. 4A). Of note, previous studies have
identified Kd values for albumin-binding sites in the
micomolar range (0.25 - 15.1 µM) in other cell-types [60,
61]. The internalized (Pronase-insensitive) and membrane
(Pronase-sensitive) uptake of 125I-HSA also increased
as a function of 125I-HSA concentration and again
plateaued at approximately 5-7.5 mg/mL (Fig. 4A). These
observations suggested a saturable membrane-binding site
which became internalized, potentially by a process of
receptor-mediated endocytosis, which has been described
previously for HSA receptors [36, 62, 63]. Notably, only
a fraction of 125I-HSA (7.5 mg/mL) was internalized, with
approximately 90% remaining membrane-bound (Fig.
4A). Additionally, the internalized or membrane-bound
125
I-HSA uptake was not significantly (p>0.05) altered in
the presence of Dp44mT (Fig. 4A).
To further elucidate the differential effects of HSA
on ligand uptake, 125I-HSA (7.5 mg/mL) uptake was
examined in the presence of unlabeled Dp44mT, Bp4eT
and PIH (25 µM) as a function of time (5-30 min; Fig.
4Bi-iii). This concentration of HSA was utilized as uptake
became clearly saturated at this concentration (Fig. 4A).
In parallel with these studies, the uptake of 14C-Dp44mT,
14
C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH (25 µM) was performed as a
function of time (5-30 min) in the presence or absence
of HSA (7.5 mg/mL) to assess the effect of this protein
on 14C-chelator uptake (Fig. 4Ci-iii). Irrespective of the
presence or absence of the ligands, HSA uptake was
biphasic, consisting of a rapid increase in internalized
(Pronase-insensitive) and membrane-bound (Pronasesensitive) 125I-HSA uptake followed by a plateau after
5 min of incubation (Fig. 4Bi-iii). These kinetics are
consistent with the initial binding of 125I-HSA to its
receptor, uptake by endocytosis, followed by release of
the ligand by exocytosis, as described for other plasma
proteins in other neoplastic cell-types [50]. As found for
125
I-HSA uptake as function of concentration (Fig. 4A),
membrane-bound 125I-HSA was markedly greater than the
internalized 125I-HSA uptake, with approximately 10% of
the total 125I-HSA being internalized (8.5 x 106 molecules
of HSA/cell; Fig. 4Bi-iii). The internalized or membranebound 125I-HSA uptake was not significantly (p>0.05)
altered in the presence of Dp44mT, Bp4eT, or PIH (Fig.

neuroepithelioma, SK-Mel-28 melanoma, MCF-7 breast
cancer, DMS-53 lung carcinoma, HepG2 hepatoma,
HK-2 immortalized kidney proximal tubule epithelial
cells) and normal, mortal cells (i.e., HUVECs and MRC-5
fibroblasts) in HSA-containing (40 mg/mL) or protein-free
media for 2 h/37oC (Supplementary Fig. 2A-C).
As evident in Fig. 3A, in SK-N-MC cells,
14
C-Dp44mT uptake was significantly (p<0.01) increased
by HSA to 300 ± 10% of the control (i.e., ligand without
HSA; Supplementary Fig. 2A). Additionally, HSA also
significantly (p<0.01-0.001) increased 14C-Dp44mT
uptake in SK-Mel-28, MCF-7, HUVEC and DMS-53
cells to 169-372% of the control, demonstrating that this
effect was not specific to SK-N-MC cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2A). Interestingly, HSA did not significantly (p>0.05)
increase uptake of 14C-Dp44mT in MRC-5, HepG2 and
HK-2 cells compared to the control (Supplementary Fig.
2A). In fact, HSA slightly, but significantly (p<0.01),
decreased 14C-Dp44mT uptake by HK-2 cells versus the
control (Supplementary Fig. 2A).
In contrast to 14C-Dp44mT, 14C-Bp4eT uptake was
significantly (p<0.01-0.001) decreased in the presence of
HSA (40 mg/mL) in all cell-types studied (Supplementary
Fig. 2B). Similarly to 14C-Bp4eT, 14C-PIH uptake was also
significantly (p<0.01-0.05) inhibited in the presence of
HSA (40 mg/mL) in all cell-types examined, except for
DMS-53, MRC-5 and HK-2 cells, where a non-significant
(p>0.05) decrease was observed (Supplementary Fig. 2C).
Hence, in contrast to 14C-Dp44mT, these results indicated
that the ability of HSA to inhibit 14C-Bp4eT or 14C-PIH
uptake was independent of the cell-type assessed.
Collectively, these studies demonstrated that
the HSA-mediated increase in 14C-Dp44mT uptake
and decrease in 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake was
observed in a variety of normal and neoplastic cell-types.
Considering this, albumin receptors/binding sites have
been previously reported in a variety of cell-types [36].
Hence, we examined the expression of five known albumin
receptors/binding proteins, namely: calreticulin [56],
hnRNP [56], cubilin [57], SPARC [58] and FcRn [59] in
the immortal and normal/mortal cell lines assessed above.
However, no direct correlation was observed between
the expression of these proteins (data not shown) and
HSA-mediated 14C-Dp44mT uptake by these cell-types
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). This observation suggested that
HSA-mediated Dp44mT uptake was independent of these
albumin-binding proteins.

Effect of Glucose-Deprivation, Metabolic and
Endocytosis Inhibitors, Temperature and
Lysosomotropic Agents on Dp44mT Uptake in the
Presence and Absence of HSA

4Bi-iii).
As shown previously (Fig. 3A), 14C-Dp44mT
uptake was significantly (p<0.001) increased in the
presence of unlabeled HSA (7.5 mg/mL) at all time points
examined (Fig. 4Ci). Moreover, as evident in Fig. 3B
and C, unlabeled HSA significantly (p<0.05) decreased
14
C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake relative to the control (Fig.
4Cii-iii). Collectively, these studies demonstrated the
altered uptake of the 14C-chelators in the presence of HSA
was not due to altered HSA uptake.

To differentiate between the cellular mechanisms
involved in 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence and
absence of HSA, a series of conditions were utilized
examining: (1) glucose-deprivation and several well
characterized metabolic inhibitors [34, 35]; (2) incubation
temperature; (3) an endocytosis inhibitor [64-67]; (4) and
lysosomotropic agents [52, 65, 68]. The effects of these
agents on 14C-Dp44mT uptake were compared to parallel
experiments examining uptake of 125I-HSA or the positive
control, 59Fe-125I-Tf. This comparison was performed as

Figure 5: The effect of metabolic and endocytosis inhibitors, temperature, lysosomotropic agents or a 100-fold excess
of protein on the uptake of 14C-Dp44mT in the presence and absence of HSA, or 59Fe-125I-Tf or 125I-HSA uptake. SK-N-

MC cells were pre-incubated with: (1) FCS-free media; (2) FCS- and glucose-free media (-Glu); (3) FCS- and Glu-free media containing the
known metabolic inhibitors sodium azide (30 mM) or sodium cyanide (5 mM); (4) FCS-free media at 4˚C; (5) FCS-free media containing
the endocytosis inhibitor, phenylglyoxal (PGO; 5 mM); (6) FCS-free media containing the lysosomotropic agents, ammonium chloride
(15 mM) or methylamine (15 mM); or (7) 100-fold excess unlabeled Fe-Tf or HSA (75 µM) for 30 min at 37˚C unless otherwise stated.

(D) 125I-HSA (0.75 µM) by cells was assessed under the continuation of these 7 incubation conditions for 1 h. The cells were then washed

uptake in the presence and absence of HSA. In these
studies, the well-characterized endo-/exocytosis inhibitor,
phenylglyoxal (PGO; 5 mM; [64-66]), or the well known
lysosomotropic agents, ammonium chloride (15 mM) or
methylamine (15 mM), were assessed [52, 65, 68]. After
incubation with PGO, there was a significant (p<0.001)
increase in 14C-Dp44mT uptake relative to the control in
the presence or absence of HSA (Fig. 5A). Considering
that PGO inhibits both endocytosis and exocytosis [64-66],
it can be speculated that the PGO-enhanced accumulation
of 14C-Dp44mT was due to the inhibition of exocytosis,
thereby preventing efflux of this ligand.
In contrast, both lysosomotropic agents had no
significant (p>0.05) effect on 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the
presence or absence of HSA relative to the control (Fig.
5A). Considering the failure of PGO and lysosomotropic
agents to inhibit 14C-Dp44mT uptake with or without
HSA, and the fact that they significantly (p<0.001-0.01)
inhibit 59Fe- and 125I-Tf uptake from 59Fe-125I-Tf (see Fig.
5B, C), these data suggest that 14C-Dp44mT uptake was
independent of endocytosis and the acidification of the
endosomal/lysosomal compartment.

Fe-125I-Tf is well known to be internalized by receptormediated endocytosis in SK-N-MC cells and many other
cell-types [52, 69-71]. In terms of 59Fe-125I-Tf uptake, we
have assessed both 59Fe bound to the specific binding sites
of the protein (59Fe-Tf), as well as the protein itself (125ITf; [52, 69-71]).

(1) Effect of Glucose-Deprivation and Metabolic
Inhibitors on 14C-Dp44mT Uptake
We previously demonstrated that 14C-Dp44mT
uptake by SK-N-MC cells was dependent on ATP
synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of
HSA, as they could be partly inhibited using the metabolic
inhibitors, sodium azide (30 mM), or sodium cyanide (5
mM) [34], which inhibit complex IV of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain [72]. In this investigation, the
same protocol was used as described in [34], in which
cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min/37oC,
followed by the addition of 14C-Dp44mT or 14C-Dp44mT
and HSA to these solutions, which were then incubated
with the cells for 1 h/37oC. We previously demonstrated
that these same incubation conditions with inhibitors
markedly suppressed cellular ATP levels [34] that are vital
for many cellular processes e.g., endocytosis [52, 70, 73].
Incubation of cells in the absence of glucose
(-Glu) led to a slight, but significant (p<0.05) decrease
in 14C-Dp44mT uptake relative to cells incubated with
glucose-containing medium (i.e., control; Fig. 5A).
Similarly to previous studies examining 14C-Dp44mT
uptake in the absence of HSA [34], herein we also show
that in glucose-free medium containing sodium azide or
sodium cyanide, 14C-Dp44mT uptake was significantly
(p<0.001) reduced to 65 ± 4% and 78 ± 6%, respectively,
relative to glucose-containing control medium (Fig.
5A). In contrast, no significant (p>0.05) difference in
14
C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence of HSA versus the
control was shown using glucose-free medium (-Glu)
or these inhibitors (Fig. 5A). These data suggest HSAmediated 14C-Dp44mT uptake was less reliant on
metabolic energy relative to 14C-Dp44mT uptake alone.

Effect of Glucose-Deprivation, Metabolic and
Endocytosis Inhibitors, Temperature and
Lysosomotropic Agents on 59Fe-125I-Transferrin
and 125I-HSA Uptake
In parallel studies implementing the same incubation
conditions as the 14C-Dp44mT uptake experiments (Fig.
5A), the cellular uptake of 59Fe-125I-Tf (0.75 µM; Fig. 5BC) or 125I-HSA (0.75 µM; Fig. 5D) were investigated, as
uptake of these proteins are well characterized [52, 65, 70,
73]. The uptake of 59Fe-125I-Tf and 125I-HSA by cells was
significantly (p<0.001-0.01) inhibited in the absence of
glucose relative to media containing glucose (control; Fig.
5B-D). This effect of glucose-free medium was generally
potentiated in the presence of sodium azide and sodium
cyanide, decreasing 59Fe-Tf, 125I-Tf and 125I-HSA uptake
to 4-14%, 23-24% and 67-79% of the control, respectively
(Fig. 5B-D). Hence, similarly to 14C-Dp44mT uptake
(Fig. 5A), 59Fe-125I-Tf and 125I-HSA uptake was dependent
on mitochondrial electron transport chain activity
(Fig. 5B-D). In contrast, this was markedly different to
14
C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence of HSA (Fig. 5A),
that was independent of the inhibition of mitochondrial
electron transport chain.
Cells incubated at 4oC internalized significantly
(p<0.001) less 59Fe-Tf, 125I-Tf, or 125I-HSA than those
incubated at 37oC (Fig. 5B-D). Incubation of cells with the
endo-/exocytosis inhibitor, PGO, or the lysosomotropic
agents, ammonium chloride or methylamine, markedly
and significantly (p<0.001-0.01) inhibited 125I-Tf (Fig.
5B) and 59Fe-Tf uptake (Fig. 5C). Similarly, the uptake
of 125I-HSA was significantly (p<0.001) inhibited in the

C-Dp44mT

Additional studies demonstrated that 14C-Dp44mT
uptake in the absence of HSA was significantly (p<0.001)
reduced at 4oC relative to 37oC (Fig. 5A). A similar and
significant (p<0.001) inhibitory effect of incubation at 4oC
was also observed on HSA-mediated 14C-Dp44mT uptake
relative to uptake observed at 37oC (Fig. 5A). Hence,
14
C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence and absence of HSA
was dependent on incubation temperature.

presence of PGO (Fig. 5D). This observation suggests
that 14C-Dp44mT enters cells independently of 125I-HSA,
as 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the presence or absence
of HSA was significantly (p<0.001) increased upon
incubation with PGO (Fig. 1A). In contrast to 59Fe-Tf
or 125I-Tf uptake, 125I-HSA uptake was not significantly
(p>0.05) altered in the presence of the lysosomotropic
agents, ammonium chloride or methylamine (Fig. 5D).
Importantly, 59Fe-Tf, 125I-Tf, or 125I-HSA uptake was
significantly (p<0.001) inhibited upon the addition of a
100-fold excess of the unlabeled protein, namely Fe-Tf
or HSA, respectively (Fig. 5B-D), suggesting competition
between the unlabeled and labeled protein for the same
binding sites. These results agree with previous studies
demonstrating 59Fe-Tf, 125I-Tf and 125I-HSA uptake occur
via energy- and temperature-sensitive endocytosis [69, 70,
74, 75].
Together, these data indicate in contrast to 59Fe-Tf,
125
I-Tf and 125I-HSA uptake by cells, 14C-Dp44mT uptake
in the presence of HSA was insensitive to glucose levels,
inhibition of energy metabolism and the suppressive
effects of lysosomotropic agents or an endo-/exocytosis
inhibitor. These observations suggested the HSAstimulated mechanism of 14C-Dp44mT uptake occurred
by a different pathway to the uptake of either 125I-HSA
or 59Fe-125I-Tf that occur by endocytosis or endocytosis
requiring endosomal acidification, respectively [52, 6971, 74, 75].

significantly (p>0.05) alter cellular 14C-Dp44mT uptake
(Fig. 3A).
In contrast to Dp44mT, the anti-proliferative activity
of Bp4eT was significantly (p<0.001) reduced by HSA,
leading to an increase in the IC50 (81 ± 4 µM) relative to its
activity in the absence of HSA (IC50: 38 ± 3 µM; Fig. 6A).
Similarly, HSA significantly (p<0.001) increased the IC50
of PIH to 507 ± 7 µM compared to the ligand alone (IC50:
426 ± 14 µM; Fig. 6A). These data are in good agreement
with our 14C-chelator uptake experiments and indicate that
the HSA-mediated increase in 14C-Dp44mT uptake (Fig.
3A) results in its enhanced anti-proliferative efficacy (Fig.
6A). In contrast, the ability of HSA to decrease cellular
14
C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake (Fig. 3B-C) decreased antiproliferative activity of both ligands (Fig. 6A).

HSA Enhances the Apoptotic Activity of Dp44mT
and Inhibits that of Bp4eT
In contrast to PIH and Bp4eT, the cellular uptake
and cytotoxicity of Dp44mT was enhanced in the presence
of HSA (Figs. 3A, D, 6A). Thus, it was important to
examine the effects of HSA on the ability of these ligands
to induce apoptosis. In order to do this, the effects of
Dp44mT, Bp4eT and PIH (50 µM) on the levels of the
apoptotic marker, cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP; [76, 77]), were examined in SK-N-MC cells after
a 6 or 12 h incubation at 37oC in the presence or absence
of HSA (40 mg/mL; Fig. 6B).
After a 6 h incubation, Dp44mT resulted in a 19.4fold increase in cleaved PARP levels relative to the control
(Fig. 6Bi). This observation was in good agreement
with the known ability of Dp44mT to induce apoptosis
in vitro and in vivo [25, 78, 79]. The level of cleaved
PARP upon co-incubation of Dp44mT and HSA for 6 h
was significantly (p<0.001) increased relative to both the
control and Dp44mT treatment alone (Fig. 6Bi). In fact,
cleaved PARP levels were 1.3-fold greater in Dp44mT
+ HSA treated cells relative to Dp44mT alone. These
results suggest HSA enhanced the ability of Dp44mT to
induce apoptosis at this early time point. In contrast, a 6 h
incubation with Bp4eT or PIH in the presence or absence
of HSA did not result in significantly (p>0.05) increased
cleaved PARP relative to their controls (Fig. 6Bi).
At the 12 h time point, Dp44mT alone and Dp44mT
+ HSA significantly (p<0.001) increased cleaved PARP
relative to their controls (i.e., control medium and control
medium + HSA, respectively; Fig. 6Bii). Cleaved PARP
levels in cells co-treated with Dp44mT + HSA showed
a significant (p<0.01) 1.2-fold increase relative to cells
treated with Dp44mT alone. Cells treated with Bp4eT
alone demonstrated significantly (p<0.001) increased
cleaved PARP relative to the control (Fig. 6Bii). However,
this effect was abolished upon incubating cells with

HSA Enhances the Anti-Proliferative Activity of
Dp44mT and Inhibits that of Bp4eT and PIH
Considering the increased uptake of 14C-Dp44mT in
the presence of HSA (Fig. 3A, D, E), the effect of HSA on
the anti-proliferative activity of Dp44mT was examined in
SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 6A). Additionally, the effect of HSA
on the anti-proliferative activity of Bp4eT and PIH were
also assessed (Fig. 6A), considering the inhibitory effects
of HSA on 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake (Fig. 3B-C).
In these experiments, cells were incubated with Dp44mT
(30-120 µM), Bp4eT (30-120 µM), PIH (150-600 µM) or
the vehicle alone (control) in the presence or absence of
HSA (40 mg/mL) for 24 h/37oC (Fig. 6A).
HSA significantly (p<0.001) increased the antiproliferative activity of Dp44mT relative to Dp44mT
alone, leading to a decrease in its IC50 (Fig. 6A). In
fact, after a 24 h incubation, HSA decreased the IC50 of
Dp44mT by ≈ 1.6-fold to 40 ± 2 µM in comparison to
Dp44mT alone (66 ± 4 µM; Fig. 6A). As an additional
control, the anti-proliferative activity of Dp44mT was
also examined in the presence of BSA (40 mg/mL; data
not shown). However, the IC50 of Dp44mT was not
significantly (p>0.05) altered in the presence of BSA (IC50:
72 ± 2 μM) relative to the ligand alone. This observation
is in agreement with our studies showing that BSA did not

Bp4eT in the presence of HSA, resulting in cleaved PARP
levels that were significantly (p<0.001) decreased relative
to Bp4eT alone and was comparable to the control (Fig.
6Bii). Thus, HSA inhibited the ability of Bp4eT to induce
cleaved PARP. In contrast, cells incubated for 12 h with
PIH in the presence or absence of HSA did not result in
cleaved PARP and were comparable to their controls (Fig.
6Bii).
Collectively, these results demonstrated that
HSA was able to significantly (p<0.001-0.01) enhance
the apoptotic effects of Dp44mT at 6 and 12 h and this
reflected its increased cellular uptake (Fig. 3A, D, E) and
anti-proliferative activity (Fig. 6A) of Dp44mT upon
HSA co-treatment. In contrast, the presence of HSA was
able to inhibit the apoptotic activity of Bp4eT after 12
h, which probably results from the decreased 14C-Bp4eT
uptake observed upon incubation with HSA (Fig. 3B, D).
On the other hand, PIH did not induce marked levels of
PARP cleavage and this reflects the poor anti-proliferative
activity of this agent [37] relative to Dp44mT [24, 25] and
Bp4eT [38] (Fig. 6A).

(40 mg/mL) as a function of time (Fig. 3A) and
concentration (Fig. 3E). In comparison, HSA markedly
decreased 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake (Fig. 3B-C).
The enhanced 14C-Dp44mT uptake was specific for HSA
and this observation was supported by two findings.
First, this effect did not occur in the presence of the same
concentration of Tf, suggesting a specific interaction
between Dp44mT and HSA and not other plasma proteins
(Fig. 3A). Second, stimulation of Dp44mT uptake did not
occur with albumin from another species, namely BSA
(75.6% sequence identity to HSA; [5]), demonstrating
specificity (Fig. 3A).
Previous studies from our laboratory determined
that the cellular uptake of 14C-Dp44mT occurred via a
saturable carrier/receptor-mediated mechanism [34] (Fig.
7B). Evidence for this mechanism was also obtained in
the current investigation in the absence of HSA, with
14
C-Dp44mT uptake saturating at 5-10 µM (Fig. 3E inset).
However, the addition of HSA led to a high-capacity,
saturable, uptake process with saturation occurring at a
Dp44mT concentration of 100 µM (Fig. 3E). Hence, in
the presence of HSA, there was evidence of an important
second saturable mechanism of Dp44mT uptake.
Moreover, HSA-stimulated Dp44mT uptake was inhibited
by an excess of unlabeled HSA (Fig. 3F), suggesting
excess HSA competes with the Dp44mT-HSA complex
for HSA membrane-binding sites (Fig. 7C).

DISCUSSION
Dp44mT, Bp4eT and PIH Bind to HSA
In this investigation, studies were performed to
determine whether Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH were able to
directly bind to albumin using fluorescence spectroscopy
and equilibrium dialysis studies. These experiments
demonstrated that all the ligands bind to HSA, although
with different avidities (Fig. 1-2). In fact, equilibrium
dialysis experiments indicated that 14C-Bp4eT became
bound to HSA with similar avidity to 14C-PIH, while
14
C-Dp44mT was most weakly bound to the protein (Fig.
2A). Molecular docking studies also supported these
conclusions (Supplementary Fig. 1). Importantly, these
findings indicating the avid binding of Bp4eT and PIH to
HSA could explain the decreased uptake of these agents
by cells in the presence of this protein (Fig. 3B-D). In
fact, in the absence of HSA, Bp4eT and PIH are known
to enter cells via passive diffusion [35]. Considering this,
HSA may act as an extracellular ‘sink’, preventing the
passive diffusion of Bp4eT and PIH into cells (Fig. 7A).
Consequently, HSA did not enhance 14C-Bp4eT or 14C-PIH
uptake or anti-proliferative activity, but conversely,
decreased it (Fig. 3B-D, 7A).

C-Dp44mT Uptake is Increased by HSA in a
Variety of Cell-Types
14

C-Dp44mT uptake was also augmented by HSA
in a variety of cancer cell lines and a non-neoplastic,
mortal cell-type (Supplementary Fig. 2A). These
observations demonstrated that the HSA-mediated
increase of 14C-Dp44mT uptake was a commonly observed
mechanism that was not unique to one cell-type. However,
there was some cell-type specificity, and the process was
not present in some neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells.
This finding suggested the differential expression of HSA
receptors/binding sites between cell-types. The HSAmediated Dp44mT uptake in a variety of normal and
neoplastic cells did not correlate with the expression of a
panel of well known HSA receptors [36], suggesting their
lack of involvement in the augmented 14C-Dp44mT uptake
mediated by HSA.

Interestingly, 125I-HSA uptake studies indicated
the presence of saturable HSA-binding sites on SK-NMC cells (Fig. 4A), although Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH
did not significantly affect 125I-HSA uptake (Fig. 4Biiii). Indeed, it was demonstrated that in the presence of
HSA, 14C-Dp44mT uptake occurs through a second,

59
Fe-125I-Tf into the cell. (A) 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH are transported by diffusion in the absence of HSA [34]. In the presence of HSA,

HSA-binding inhibits the uptake of 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH, irrespective of the cell-type. This is due to the high affinity of Bp4eT or PIH
for HSA, relative to Dp44mT, reducing the levels of free drug available to diffuse into cells. (B) A different mechanism is demonstrated
by the structurally similar ligand, Dp44mT. 14C-Dp44mT is taken up by cells via a receptor/carrier in the absence of HSA. This uptake
process is saturable, energy- and temperature-dependent and subject to inhibition by excess unlabeled Dp44mT [34]. (C) In the presence of
HSA, 14C-Dp44mT uptake occurs through a second, high capacity, saturable process that is cell-type specific and inhibited in the presence
of excess unlabeled HSA. This process may be facilitated by: (i) a specific HSA-binding site; (ii) the fact most cellular HSA is bound to
the cell membrane (rather than internalized); and (iii) the relatively low affinity of Dp44mT for HSA. These three properties facilitate
Dp44mT delivery to cells and create a concentration gradient at the cell surface to enable enhanced uptake via dissociation and passive
diffusion. The enhanced delivery of 14C-Dp44mT by HSA increases apoptosis and cytotoxicity. (D) 125I-HSA uptake by cells was saturable,
temperature-dependent, inhibited by excess unlabeled HSA, and sensitive to glucose starvation and inhibitors of energy metabolism or
endocytosis. Hence, this process was consistent with HSA endocytosis that is known to occur [74, 92]. (E) 59Fe-125I-Tf uptake occurs
following the binding to its receptor, Tf receptor 1 (TfR1). This process was temperature- and energy-dependent, and subject to inhibition
by excess unlabeled Tf, an endocytosis inhibitor, and in addition, lysosomotropic agents. Hence, 59Fe-125I-Tf uptake occurs through the well
characterized process of receptor-mediated endocytosis that requires endosomal acidification [52, 68, 71, 93].

high capacity, low affinity, saturable process (Fig. 3E)
that is cell-type specific (Supplementary Fig. 2A) and
was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled HSA
(Fig. 3F). This uptake process had the following three
features: (i) it was facilitated by a specific HSA-binding
site (Fig. 3E, F); (ii) most cellular HSA was bound to the
cell membrane, rather than internalized (Fig. 4A, Bi-iii);
and (iii) the avidity of Dp44mT for HSA was relatively
low (Fig. 2). Together, these three properties suggest
Dp44mT is delivered to cells in a HSA-dependent manner
that creates a concentration gradient at the cell surface that
enhances subsequent uptake via dissociation and passive
diffusion (Fig. 7C). Indeed, HSA-mediated 14C-Dp44mT
uptake was not inhibited by glucose-deprivation, metabolic
inhibitors, an endocytosis inhibitor, or lysosomotropic
agents (Fig. 5A), indicating a passive uptake process (Fig.
7C), rather than active endocytosis which occurred for
125
I-HSA (Fig. 5D, 7D) and 59Fe-125I-Tf (Fig. 5B,C, 7E).
In clear contrast to HSA-mediated 14C-Dp44mT
uptake (Fig. 5A), 125I-HSA uptake by cells was reduced
by glucose starvation and inhibitors of energy metabolism
or endocytosis (Figs. 5D, 7D). Together, these data
suggest augmentation of 14C-Dp44mT uptake in the
presence of HSA was independent of HSA internalization.
Moreover, in contrast to HSA-dependent and independent
14
C-Dp44mT uptake (Fig. 5A), and 125I-HSA uptake
(Fig. 5D), the uptake of 59Fe-125I-Tf occurred by the
well characterized endocytic mechanism that required
acidification [52, 69-71]. This was demonstrated by the
inhibition of 59Fe-Tf uptake (Fig. 5C), and to a lesser
extent 125I-Tf uptake (Fig. 5B), by lysosomotropic agents
(Fig. 7E).
In terms of the mechanism of intracellular uptake
of other molecules bound to HSA (e.g., fatty acids), it
has been reported that after HSA-binding to the cell
membrane, fatty acid-bound albumin undergoes a
conformational change [5, 11]. This alteration then results
in fatty acid release in the proximity of the membrane for
cellular uptake [5, 11]. The subsequent reduced affinity of
albumin for the cell surface then leads to its release from
the membrane [5, 11]. Similar mechanisms of transport
have also been proposed for albumin-bound testosterone
and tryptophan [5, 12-14]. In an analogous way to
Dp44mT, the low affinity of albumin for testosterone
results in the transport of this hormone from the plasma
for rapid release and delivery to tissues [5, 80]. Hence,
the mechanism reported in this study for HSA-mediated
Dp44mT uptake, shows similar characteristics to those
described for fatty acids and testosterone.
Binding of Dp44mT to HSA had the lowest relative
affinity relative to Bp4eT and PIH (Fig. 2A). Hence, the
relatively low affinity of Dp44mT for HSA may facilitate
the release of Dp44mT for uptake by passive diffusion
(Fig. 7C). In contrast, the relatively higher affinity of
Bp4eT and PIH may prevent this (Fig. 7A), and thus,
this may explain the differential effects of HSA observed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

on ligand uptake demonstrated herein. Considering this,
it is notable that the ability of HSA to inhibit Bp4eT or
PIH uptake was irrespective of the cell-type assessed
(Supplementary Fig. 2B-C), suggesting the inhibition
was independent of the cell-type. In marked contrast, the
stimulation of Dp44mT uptake by HSA was dependent on
cell-type (Supplementary Fig. 2A), implicating the crucial
role of the cell via the expression of HSA-binding sites in
terms of the effect observed.

HSA Potentiates Dp44mT Targeting to Tumor
Cells Resulting in Increased Anti-Proliferative
and Apoptotic Activity
Significantly, HSA increased the anti-proliferative
and apoptotic effects of Dp44mT (Fig. 6). Hence, the
HSA-mediated increase in 14C-Dp44mT uptake and
targeting (Fig. 3A, D, E) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy
of this drug. Conversely, the addition of HSA decreased
the anti-proliferative activity of Bp4eT and PIH (Fig. 6A)
and inhibited the ability of Bp4eT to induce apoptosis
(Fig. 6B). This can be attributed to the HSA-induced
inhibition of 14C-Bp4eT and 14C-PIH uptake (Fig. 3B-D),
resulting in reduced anti-cancer efficacy of these ligands.
These observations could be important for designing new
therapeutics based on Dp44mT that enhance its biological
efficacy. For instance, albumin-containing nanoparticles
have been utilized for improving the activity of standard
chemotherapeutics [17, 81, 82]. These agents utilize the
enhanced permeability and retention effect and cellular
uptake pathways of albumin to enhance drug permeation
into tumors [17, 81-83].
Albumin nanoparticles containing the established
chemotherapeutic, paclitaxel (marketed under the name
Abraxane®), have been approved for the treatment of breast
cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung
cancer [84-86]. In fact, Abraxane® is less toxic and more
effective than conventional paclitaxel [84-86]. Similarly,
the development of albumin nanoparticles containing
thiosemicarbazones, such as Dp44mT, may enhance the
delivery, anti-tumor targeting, selectivity and toxicological
profile of this agent. Other thiosemicarbazone-loaded
nanoparticles (known as “nanochelators”) have been
examined [87], although albumin was not utilized in their
composition to enhance uptake. Hence, the development
of novel albumin-containing nanoparticles represents an
exciting therapeutic avenue.
In conclusion, physiological levels of HSA mediate
the enhanced cellular uptake and targeting of Dp44mT,
resulting in increased anti-proliferative and apoptotic
activity. The uptake of Dp44mT in the presence of HSA
could provide therapeutic benefits by delivering greater
levels of drug to cancer cells, improving its anti-tumor
efficacy and tolerability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

duplicate the experimental conditions utilized for uptake
experiments with the 14C-labeled ligands (see below). The
14
C-chelators (25 µM) were then added and the samples
were further incubated for 2 h/37oC. The solutions
were then placed in a dialysis membrane sac with a 12
kDa molecular weight cut-off (Sigma-Aldrich). These
samples underwent dialysis in PBS and were allowed to
equilibrate for 24 h/4oC on a rotating mixer. Experiments
using the 14C-labeled ligands alone demonstrated that after
this incubation period, an equilibrium was established
with equal amounts of the label inside and outside of
the dialysis sac. Then 1 mL aliquots were taken from
the dialysate and the dialysis sac and were processed
as previously described [34] using an oxidizer (Sample
Oxidizer Model 307; Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical
Sciences) to prevent quenching. The radioactivity in
samples was measured using a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta
TriLux β Counter (PerkinElmer) with appropriate
calibration standards and background controls. The results
were expressed as % of chelator released from the dialysis
sack into the dialysate.

Chemicals
HSA (≥99% purity; Cat. #A8763), BSA (≥98%
purity; Cat. #A7906), transferrin (Tf; ≥98% purity; Cat.
#T4382), warfarin (Cat. #A2250) and ibuprofen (Cat.
#I4883) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). The non-radiolabeled ligands, Dp44mT, Bp4eT and
PIH, were synthesized and characterized by established
methods [23, 37, 38]. The 14C-labeled chelators,
14
C-Bp4eT, 14C-Dp44mT and 14C-PIH, were synthesized
by the Institute of Isotopes Ltd (Budapest, Hungary) and
were purified and prepared as previously described [34,
35].

Fluorescence Quenching Studies
The fluorescence spectra of HSA (2 µM) was
measured with increasing concentrations of the chelators,
Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH (0-3.67 µM), after a 2 h
incubation at 37˚C on a LS-55 spectrofluorometer (Perkin
Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA) with
a 1 cm path-length quartz cell using 15 nm/6 nm slit
widths and a thermostat bath. The excitation and emission
wavelengths for HSA were 295 nm and 310-450 nm,
respectively, with scanning at 5 nm increments.

Computational Docking Studies
The 2-D structures of the HSA-binding ligands
were built using the Schrödinger suite (Schrödinger Inc.,
New York, NY, USA). Geometry minimizations were
performed on all ligand conformations, with all possible
ionization states at pH 7.0 ± 2.0, using the OPLS_2005
force field in MacroModel v9.8 and the Truncated Newton
Conjugate Gradient. Optimizations were converged
to a gradient RMSD below 0.05 kJ/mol, or continued
to a maximum of 5000 iterations, at which there were
negligible changes in RMSD gradients. Glide v5.8 and the
extra precision scoring function were used to estimate the
affinities of protein–ligand binding [89].
Initially, warfarin, Dp44mT, Bp4eT and PIH, were
docked into Sudlow’s site I (warfarin site), where the
docking grid was defined and generated based upon the
ligand-binding domain of the crystal structure of HSA in
complex with warfarin (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code:
2BXD; www.rcsb.org). Similarly, the binding site for
Sudlow’s site II (ibuprofen site) was obtained from the
co-crystal structure of HSA with ibuprofen (PDB code:
2BXG), where ibuprofen defined the centroid of the
docking grid. No constraints were fixed in the active site,
allowing the ligands to bind in all possible orientations.
Protein preparation and refinement protocols were
performed on the structure (Protein Preparation Wizard,
Schrödinger).

Circular Dichroism
Far-UV CD data were collected using a Jasco 815
spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier- thermostated
6-chamber sample holder at 20°C (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan)
using a 1 mm path-length quartz cell. Stock solutions of
the chelators (1 mM) were prepared in ethanol. Samples
containing HSA (2 μM) in the presence and absence of
the chelators, Dp44mT, Bp4eT or PIH (10 μM), or the
chaotrope, GndCl (Sigma-Aldrich; 6 M), were prepared in
PBS and incubated at 37˚C for 2 h prior to measurement.
Spectra were collected at 20 nm/min over the range of
200–250 nm, with a sensitivity of 100, step size of 1 nm,
digital integration time of 1 s and are the average of five
scans with buffer baseline correction and background
subtraction. The percentage of α-helices and β-sheets was
calculated using DichroCalc [88].

Equilibrium Dialysis Studies
Equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed
using standard methods [44]. In these studies, HSA (40
mg/mL) was incubated with an excess of warfarin or
ibuprofen (5 mM) or an excess of unlabeled Dp44mT,
Bp4eT or PIH (0.5 mM) in PBS for 2 h/37oC in PBS to

Cell Culture
The following human cell-types were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;
10392

Oncotarget

Manassas, VA), namely DMS-53 lung carcinoma cells,
SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells, SK-Mel-28 melanoma
cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MRC-5 fibroblast cells,
HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and the papillomavirus
16 transformed kidney proximal tubule HK-2 cells. All
of these cell-types, except DMS-53 lung carcinoma cells,
were cultured as previously described [35] in minimum
essential media (MEM; Life Technologies) at 37oC.
The DMS-53 lung carcinoma cell line was cultured in a
similar manner as above using Roswell Park Memorial
Institute 1640 (RPMI 1640; Life Technologies). These
media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum
(FCS; Sigma-Aldrich) and the following additives from
Life Technologies: 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate, 1% (v/v)
100× non-essential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 µg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine and 0.28 µg/
mL fungizone. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were kindly donated by Mr. P. Pisansarakit
(Heart Research Institute, Sydney, Australia) and were
cultured according to established techniques [35]. All cells
were cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air.

at 10,000 rpm/1 min/4°C. The supernatant obtained
represents the Pronase-sensitive membrane-bound fraction
and the pellet was resuspended in PBS and represents
the Pronase-insensitive internalized compartment.
Radioactivity in each fraction was assessed as described
above.

C-Dp44mT Cellular Efflux

14

Examination of 14C-Dp44mT release from prelabeled SK-N-MC cells was performed using standard
techniques [34, 35]. Briefly, SK-N-MC cells were
incubated in a similar manner to uptake studies and were
pre-labeled with 14C-Dp44mT (25 μM) in the presence
or absence of HSA (40 mg/mL) for 120 min/37oC. The
cells were then placed on ice, the media removed and
the cell monolayer washed four times with ice-cold PBS.
Phenol red-free media containing HSA (40 mg/mL; 1 mL;
37oC) was then added to each plate and the cells were reincubated at 37oC for up to 60 min/37oC. At the end of
each reincubation period, the cells were placed on ice and
the overlying media was placed into scintillation vials to
estimate the level of extracellular 14C-chelator. Then PBS
(1 mL) was added to the cells, which were subsequently
removed from the plates using a plastic spatula. This
suspension was placed into β-scintillation vials and
represents cellular-associated 14C-chelator. Radioactivity
was determined using a β-counter. Results were expressed
as % of 14C-chelator released into the medium.

Cellular Uptake of 14C-Ligands
The cellular uptake of 14C-chelators was performed
in accordance with previously established procedures [34,
35]. Briefly, cells in culture dishes were incubated with 25
µM of 14C-chelator in supplement- and FCS-free media
in the presence and absence of HSA (5 or 40 mg/mL),
BSA (40 mg/mL) or Tf (5 or 40 mg/mL) for 0-120 min at
37oC. The cellular uptake of 14C-Dp44mT (0.1-150 µM)
was also examined as a function of concentration in the
absence or presence of HSA (40 mg/mL) at 4 or 37oC
over a 2 h incubation. In studies examining the effect of
proteins on 14C-chelator uptake as a function of protein
concentration, cells were incubated in medium containing
HSA or BSA (0-250 mg/mL) for 120 min/37oC. Upon
completion of uptake experiments, cells were placed on
ice and washed four times with ice-cold PBS. The cells
were then resuspended the cells in PBS (1 mL) and
Ultima Gold™ scintillation fluid was added (2.5 mL;
PerkinElmer). Radioactivity was measured using the
β-counter, as described above.

Western Blot Analysis
Protein extraction from cells and western blot
analysis were performed using established protocols
[90]. The primary antibodies used were rabbit antihuman calreticulin antibody (1:500; Cat. #2891, Cell
Signaling, Boston, MA, USA), goat anti-human cubilin
antibody (1:1000; Cat. #sc-23644, Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
rabbit anti-human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) antibody
(1:500; Cat. #sc-66892, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-human
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/
B1 antibody (1:1000; Cat. #9304, Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti-human secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine
(SPARC) antibody (1:1000; Cat. #5240, Cell Signaling),
rabbit anti-human cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP) antibody (1:1,000; Cat. #9541S, Cell Signaling)
and mouse anti-human β-actin antibody (1:10,000; Cat.
#A5316, Sigma-Aldrich). β-actin was used as a loading
control. Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus™
Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare,
Australia) was used for detection and images were
processed using the ChemiDoc™ MP Imaging System
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Densitometric analysis of
western blots was performed using Quantity One software
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and normalized implementing

Assay Examining Internalized and MembraneBound 14C-Ligand Uptake by Cells
In studies examining the internalized and
membrane-bound uptake of the 14C-ligands, the general
protease, “Pronase” (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. #P8811) was
used, implementing established methods [49, 52]. Briefly,
cells were treated with 14C-chelators (25 µM), washed four
times on ice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated on ice
with Pronase (1 mg/mL) for 30 min/4°C. Subsequently,
cells were removed from the plate on ice and centrifuged

Labeling of Human Tf with 59Fe and
Human Serum Albumin with 125I

I and

125

Human Tf (Sigma-Aldrich) was labeled with 125I
and Fe (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences)
using standard methods [50, 51]. HSA was labeled with
125
I using the chloramine-T method [91]. Non-protein
bound 125I was removed by chromatography using PD10
desalting columns (VWR International, Australia).
Further desalting was conducted using Millipore Amicon
Ultra-15 Ultrafiltration device (>30 kDa; Billerica, MA).
Trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) precipitation was
used to determine labeling and desalting efficiency, which
was >95%. Protein concentration was measured using
UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1800; Shimadzu,
Kyoto, Japan) at 279 nm (εHSA = 0.531 g/L; [5]).
Competition studies of the 125I-HSA with non-labeled HSA
demonstrated the labeled protein retained its conformation.

The cellular uptake of 14C-Dp44mT, 125I-HSA or
Fe- I-Tf in the presence or absence of metabolic and
endocytosis inhibitors, lysosomotropic agents or at 4oC,
was performed as described above in the “Cellular Uptake
of 14C-Ligands” and “125I-HSA Cellular Uptake” sections
with modifications. SK-N-MC cells were pre-incubated
for 30 min/37oC with: (1) FCS-free media; (2) FCS- and
glucose (Glu)-free media (-Glu); (3) FCS- and Glu-free
media containing the known metabolic inhibitors (SigmaAldrich), sodium azide (NaN3; 30 mM) or sodium cyanide
(NaCN; 5 mM) used previously [34, 35]; (4) FCS-free
media at 4˚C; (5) FCS-free media containing the well
characterized endocytosis inhibitor, phenylglyoxal (PGO;
5 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) [64-67]; or (6) FCS-free media
containing the lysosomotropic agents (Sigma-Aldrich),
ammonium chloride (NH4Cl; 15 mM) or methylamine
(MeNH2; 15 mM) [52, 65, 68]; or (7) a 100-fold excess of
unlabeled Fe-Tf or HSA (75 µM) at 37˚C unless otherwise
stated.
The media were then removed and the cells
subsequently incubated under the seven preincubation
conditions listed above in the presence of 14C-Dp44mT
(25 µM) with or without HSA (40 mg/mL), 125I-HSA
(0.75 µM) or 59Fe-125I-Tf (0.75 µM) for 1 h at 37oC unless
otherwise stated. Radioactivity in the 14C-Dp44mTcontaining samples was then measured using the β-counter
above. The intracellular levels of 125I-HSA, 59Fe or 125ITf were examined by measuring the radioactivity of
the Pronase-insensitive (internalized) fraction using the
γ-counter, as described above.

I-HSA Cellular Uptake

125

Cellular uptake of 125I-HSA was performed as
described above in “Cellular Uptake of 14C-Ligands”
with modifications. SK-N-MC cells were incubated with
125
I-HSA (0.001-10 mg/mL) in FCS-free media in the
presence and absence of unlabeled Dp44mT (25 µM) for
2 h/37oC. In subsequent studies performed as a function of
time, cells were incubated with 125I-HSA at a concentration
of 7.5 mg/mL, as it provided appropriate levels of cellular
labeling. The uptake of 125I-HSA was examined in the
presence and absence of unlabeled Dp44mT, Bp4eT
or PIH (25 µM) over 5-30 min/37oC. At the end of the
incubation, cells were placed on ice, the medium removed
and cells washed four times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were
then incubated with Pronase (1 mg/mL) for 30 min/4oC to
separate the membrane-bound and internalized 125I-HSA
fractions. Radioactivity was measured on a γ-counter
(Wallac Wizard 3, Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical
Sciences).

Cell Growth Inhibition Assay by Direct Cell
Counts
SK-N-MC cells were seeded in 24-well plates at
a density of 7.5 x 104 cells/well in 500 µL of complete
culture medium and incubated overnight at 37oC. After this
incubation, cells were treated for 24 h/37oC with Dp44mT
(30, 60 or 120 µM), Bp4eT (30, 60 or 120 µM), PIH (125,
250 or 500 µM) or the vehicle alone (control) in complete
MEM containing diferric Tf (1.2 µM; Sigma-Aldrich) in
the presence or absence of HSA (40 mg/mL). Cells were
then harvested using PBS/EDTA, resuspended and stained
using Trypan blue (0.4%; Sigma-Aldrich). Cell counts and
viability were assessed by direct manual counting using a
hemocytometer. Results were expressed as a percentage
of the control and the concentration required to inhibit
growth by 50% (IC50) was calculated.

Non-Linear Regression Analysis of Ligand
Binding to Cells
Non-linear regression analysis was performed in
studies examining cellular 14C-ligand or 125I-labeled HSA
uptake as a function of concentration using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 Software (San Diego, CA) to measure the
maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) and the
equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd).
