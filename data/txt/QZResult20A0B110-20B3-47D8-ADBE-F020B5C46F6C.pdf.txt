ABSTRACT:
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy
with poor overall survival. Constitutive as well as cytokine-initiated activation of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is a common feature of AML patients, and inhibition of
this pathway is considered as a possible therapeutic strategy in AML. Human AML
cells and different stromal cell populations were cultured under highly standardized
in vitro conditions. We investigated the effects of mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and
temsirolimus) and PI3K inhibitors (GDC-0941 and 3-methyladenin (3-MA)) on cell
proliferation and the constitutive release of angioregulatory mediators by AML and
stromal cells.
Primary human AML cells were heterogeneous, though most patients showed high
CXCL8 levels and detectable release of CXCL10, Ang-1, HGF and MMP-9. Hierarchical
clustering analysis showed that disruption of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways decreased
AML cell release of CXCL8-11 for a large subset of patients, whereas the effects on
other mediators were divergent. Various stromal cells (endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
cells with osteoblastic phenotype) also showed constitutive release of angioregulatory
mediators, and inhibitors of both the PI3K and mTOR pathway had anti-proliferative
effects on stromal cells and resulted in decreased release of these angioregulatory
mediators. PI3K and mTOR inhibitors can decrease constitutive cytokine release both
by AML and stromal cells, suggesting potential direct and indirect antileukemic effects.

INTRODUCTION

(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway [4-6]. This pathway is important for regulation
of cellular growth and metabolism and aberrant PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling is found in several malignancies [7].
Pharmacological targeting of this pathway is therefore
considered as a promising therapeutic approach in several
cancer types [8-10], including AML [11-14].
Both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis seem to
be supported by neighboring stromal cells in the bone
marrow microenvironment, including fibroblast-like cells,
osteoblasts and endothelial cells [15-18]. This supportive
function is mediated through formation of so-called
endosteal and vascular niches that may provide a sanctuary
for subpopulations of malign cells to evade or circumvent
drug-induced death [19]. Endothelial cells may also

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a
heterogeneous malignancy characterized by clonal
proliferation and accumulation of immature myeloblasts in
the bone marrow [1, 2]. The overall disease-free survival is
only 40-50% even for younger patients below 60-65 years
of age who receive the most intensive chemotherapy [2],
whereas long-term disease-free survival is uncommon for
elderly patients and patients unfit for intensive therapy due
to comorbidity. New and less toxic therapeutic strategies
are therefore strongly needed in AML [3], and one
alternative therapeutic strategy is inhibition of intracellular
signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase

contribute to leukemogenesis through AML-induced bone
marrow angiogenesis with an increased microvasculatory
network in the bone marrow [19, 20]. Bone marrow
angiogenesis is regulated by the local cytokine network
and a shift in the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic
mediators in favor of angiogenesis [21]. Thus, the
contribution of angiogenesis to leukemogenesis involves
continuous interactions between the leukemic cells and
the surrounding microenvironment including the stroma,
and angiogenesis may then be supported by the release
of angioregulatory cytokines both from the leukemic cells
and from the nonleukemic stromal cells [19].
Previous experimental studies have used
osteosarcoma cell lines with an osteoblastic phenotype
[22, 23], well-characterized fibroblast cell lines [24],
and normal endothelial cells [18, 23] as standardized

experimental models for the study of AML/stromal
cell interactions. In this study, we used the same
methodological approach to investigate effects of various
PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors and report that the constitutive
release of angioregulatory mediators by AML and stromal
cells is altered.

quantified the constitutive release of 10 angioregulatory
cytokines during in vitro culture of primary human AML
cells derived from 60 unselected patients. The overall
results are summarized in Table 2. The majority of patients
showed detectable release of CXCL8, CXCL10, Ang-1,
HGF and MMP-9, but the levels showed a wide variation
between individual patients. CXCL8 levels (median
level 12 002 pg/mL) were generally higher than the other
cytokine levels, but HGF was usually also released at
relatively high levels (median level 409 pg/mL).
We performed an unsupervised clustering of the 60
patients with regard to their angioregulatory profile, i.e.
their constitutive cytokine release (Fig. 1). The values
were first normalized by dividing with the maximum
release value, and the angioregulatory mediators then
formed two major clusters including (i) the proangiogenic
HGF, VEGF and CXCL8 together with the antiangiogenic
chemokines CXCL9-11 and (ii) Ang-1/2 together with
MMP-2/9. The patients could also be divided into two
major clusters, the main differences between them
being increased release of CXCL8, CXCL9 and Ang-1

in the upper cluster I (Table 3). Thus, the difference in
angioregulatory profiles between individual patients is
mainly caused by differences in their chemokine release
(Table 3), and quantitatively major differences between
CXCL8 release was observed between the two clusters.
The two clusters did not differ with regard to AML
etiology (de novo versus secondary/relapse) differentiation
(FAB classification or CD34 stem cell marker expression),
cytogenetic abnormalities, and/or frequency of NPM1 or

The results are presented as the median % inhibition (upper value) of mediators released after drug treatment compared to levels in

inhibitors (GDC-0941 1 μM, 3-MA 1 mM) on the release
of 10 angioregulatory mediators. Levels of mediators
released by AML cells are shown in Table 2 and the results
from the statistical analyses are summarized in Table
4. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and temsirolimus
showed similarities in their inhibitory profile with a
strong reduction of CXCL10, HGF and MMP-9 levels
corresponding to p-values ≤0.002, whereas there was
no significant reduction of the high CXCL8 levels. In
contrast, the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 caused
a statistically significant reduction of all mediators,
although the reduction of CXCL9, CXCL11 and VEGF
was relatively small. The PI3K-class III inhibitor 3-MA
had an intermediate effect and caused a strong inhibition
of CXCL9-11, HGF, Ang-1/2 and MMP-2. Thus, even
though these pharmacological agents inhibit various steps
in the same intracellular signaling pathway, they differ in
their effects on the constitutive cytokine release and the
PI3K inhibitors then cause a more extensive alteration of
the angioregulatory profile than mTOR inhibitors.
We then performed a clustering analysis of the
60 patients based on the pharmacological effects on the
constitutive release of the 10 mediators (Fig. 2). Two
major patient clusters were found, and these two clusters
differed especially with regard to the pharmacological
inhibition of constitutive CXCL9-11 release, whereas the

pharmacological effects on release of the other cytokines
showed a wide variation and did not differ significantly
between the two major clusters.
Finally, we also performed an unsupervised
clustering for the 60 AML patients based on the
pharmacological effects on release of angioregulatory
mediators. The cytokine clustering showed similarities
between the four inhibitors and confirmed the observations
described above (see Fig. 1): (i) the chemokines clustered
separately from the other mediators (ii) VEGF clustered
together with HGF, the two angiopoietins clustered
together, and the two MMPs clustered together (data not
shown).

and (ii) Ang-2 mRNA expression showed a significant
correlation with supernatant protein levels (p=0.0245,
r=0.618, Pearson’s correlation, Fig. 3). Thus, only these
two cytokines show evidence for a regulation of protein
expression at the mRNA level.

Pharmacological targeting of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway has antiproliferative effects on
stromal cells
Drug effects on stromal cell proliferation were
examined using the 3H-thymidine incorporation assay.
All stromal cells were treated with drugs over a wide
concentration range and dose-dependent antiproliferative
effects were observed (Fig. 4). However the effects varied
between different cell types and between different drugs:
The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and temsirolimus
generally showed a weaker maximal inhibitory effect than
the PI3K inhibitors. These two drugs showed very similar
inhibitory effects on stromal cell proliferation with only
minimal differences between drugs.
The PI3K inhibitors demonstrated a significant
decrease in proliferation only for the highest concentration
used in this study. The specific class I PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941 showed a 40 % inhibition for all cell lines at
the highest concentration, whereas the class III inhibitor
3-MA caused a similar inhibitory effect but only for
certain cell lines.
The different cell lines also varied in their
susceptibility to the pharmacological interventions.
HUVECs showed less susceptibility to pharmacological

Association between protein and mRNA levels for
angioregulatory cytokines
We used microarray analysis to examine mRNA
levels in non-cultured leukemia cells for 31 of the 60
AML patients investigated for their constitutive cytokine
release. We performed both (i) correlation analysis
between detectable cytokine protein levels and mRNA
levels and (ii) comparison of mRNA levels for patients
with detectable and undetectable cytokine levels. For
most of the angioregulatory mediators we did not find
any significant correlations between protein/mRNA levels
or difference in mRNA levels between patients with
detectable and undetectable mediator release. However,
two exceptions were seen: (i) patients with undetectable
HGF release had a significantly lower HGF-mRNA
expression (p=0.0079, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fig. 3);

interventions, whereas the osteoblastic Cal72 and the
fibroblast HFL1 cell line also had a slightly more resistant
profile.
Thus, all four drugs show inhibitory effects
on stromal cell release of various cytokines at drug
concentrations that also have similar inhibitory effects in
primary human AML cells.

by stromal cells, except for inhibitory effects observed
for GDC-0941. CXCL8 was released at high levels by
primary AML cells for most patients and only GDC-0941
inhibited the release.
The antiangiogenic CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11
were not released at detectable levels by any stromal cell
types. All three antiangiogenic mediators were released
by AML cells and all PI3K/mTOR inhibitors generally
inhibited their release.
The release of Ang-1 and to a lesser degree Ang2 was inhibited by the PI3K/mTOR inhibitors both for
stromal and AML cells.
The inhibitors had divergent effects on VEGF
release both for stromal and AML cells.
HGF was not released by stromal cells, but was
commonly released by AML cells, and treatment with the
four PI3K/mTOR inhibitors then reduced this release.
Stromal cells released detectable MMP-2 and MMP10, but only undetectable or low levels of MMP-9. The
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors generally decreased MMP-2
levels, but increased MMP-10 release by stromal cells.
In contrast, AML cells released MMP-2 and MMP-9 and
levels were decreased by treatment with all PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors.
Thus, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors affect stromal cell
cytokine release at the same concentrations that affect the
release by the primary AML cells, and the drugs seem to

Pharmacological interventions have diverse effect
on cytokine release from bone marrow stromal
cells
We also investigated the effects of pharmacological
intervention on the cell release of angioregulatory
mediators after treatment with rapamycin 1 μM,
temsirolimus 0.1 μM, GDC-0941 1 μM and 3-MA 10 mM.
These concentrations were selected because the drugs then
showed a clear antiproliferative effect for the majority of
susceptible cell lines. For ten investigated stromal cell
lines/primary cells, the pharmacological effects on the
constitutive release of 13 angioregulatory mediators were
examined including CXCL8-12, Ang-1/2, VEGF, HGF,
bFGF MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-10 (Table 5) and the
results were compared with the effects on AML cells (see

have an overall proangiogenic effect on the chemokine
release (maintained high CXCL8, decreased CXCL911); this effect is further supported by increased MMP10 release by stromal cells. The increased stromal cell
release of CXCL12 may also stimulate leukemogenesis
through effects on growth, survival and migration [26].
These AML-stimulating effects are counteracted by
decreased HGF, Ang-1, VEGF and MMP-2 levels. The
overall effects can only be explained by a specific effect
of pharmacological PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibition on the
cytokine release; the effects cannot be explained by a
nonspecific effect of decreased proliferation/viability
because then a general decrease in the levels of all
cytokines would be expected. It is thereby difficult to
predict the final effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition on
bone marrow angioregulation as the effect will probably
vary between patients.

and from the neighboring stromal cells in the bone marrow
microenvironment [15, 18, 28]. In the present study we
show that inhibitors of the PI3K and mTOR pathway
may affect leukemogenesis through inhibition of the
constitutive release of angioregulatory mediators both
when investigating primary AML cells derived from a
large group of unselected patients [29] as well as bone
marrow stromal cells [23, 24]. The effects on stromal cells
were detected at the same drug concentrations as for the
AML cells.
As explained in Material and methods the doses of
the various drugs used in our present experiments were
selected based on the observations in previous studies
and pilot dose-response experiments with primary human
AML cells. Our intention was to investigate whether
these drugs have simultaneous effects both on leukemic
and stromal cells and thus mediate their effects on
AML cells both through direct and indirect effects (i.e.
via neighboring stromal cells). For this reason we used
the same concentrations both in AML and stromal cell
experiments. The similarities between the various drugs
with regard to their functional effects both in leukemic and
stromal cells further support that the effects are mediated
through common targets (i.e. the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
pathway) and not through off-target effects, and this is also
consistent with previous experiments [30-40].

DISCUSSION
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is implicated in
leukemogenesis [27], and has emerged as a potential
therapeutic target in AML [6, 7, 14]. Furthermore, several
studies suggest a role of angiogenesis in human AML,
and this process is regulated by various angioregulatory
soluble mediators derived both from the leukemic cells

The effects of mTOR (rapamycin, temsirolimus) and PI3K inhibition (GDC-0941, 3-MA) on in vitro constitutive mediator release was
investigated for 10 different stromal cell populations. Cell supernatants were harvested from stromal cell cultures before confluence was
reached. Levels of each mediator were determined using ELISA, and relative values (levels in drug-treated cultures divided by levels in
corresponding control cultures) were log(2) converted. Squares are omitted where no detectable levels of mediators were measured in

Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new
capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, and the
associations between levels of angiogenic mediators
and survival after intensive chemotherapy suggest that
angioregulation is also important for chemosensitivity
in human AML [41-44]. Several mediators contribute
to angioregulation in AML. Firstly, primary AML cells
release several pro- (e.g. CXCL8) and antiangiogenic (e.g.
CXCL9-11) chemokines, but the chemokine release profile
differs between patients [45]. Secondly, AML cells release
several MMPs, and MMP-9 seems to be associated with
chemokine release, in contrast to MMP-2 which possibly
is associated with prognosis after chemotherapy [41].
Finally, other important angioregulatory cytokines that
seem to be associated with prognosis in human AML are
the Ang-1/2 system, HGF and VEGF [15, 43, 44, 46].
In the present study, we analyzed the constitutive
release profile for 10 angioregulatory mediators commonly
released by primary human AML cells [47], and we
compared the release for 60 unselected patients. Relatively
high levels of proangiogenic CXCL8 were detected for
almost all patients and this chemokine clustered separately,
whereas the antiangiogenic CXCL9-11 clustered together
and usually showed lower levels than CXCL8 and for
most patients CXCL10 levels were higher than CXCL9/11
levels. These variations in constitutive chemokine release
were the major contributors to the classification of patients
into two major clusters in the hierarchical cluster analysis
based on constitutive release of angioregulatory mediators
(Fig. 1). Finally, we observed a wide variation in the
pharmacological effects on constitutive mediator release
between patients, but the inhibitory effects on chemokine
release were most important for the classification/
clustering of patients into two major subsets based on
effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition on the constitutive
release of angiogenic mediators (Fig. 2). Finally, clinical
or biological characteristics of our patients showed no
association with the clustering based on constitutive
release of mediators alone or pharmacological effects on
the constitutive release (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).
Bone marrow stromal cells contribute to the local
cytokine network and can thereby regulate leukemic
hematopoiesis both through direct effects on the malignant
cells and through indirect effects via other cells in the
bone marrow microenvironment, e.g. the constitutive
release of angioregulatory mediators by various stromal
cells can affect leukemogenesis through effects on
endothelial cells and thereby stimulate angiogenesis
and disease development as suggested by previous
experimental studies [15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 28]. Potential
new therapeutic agents should therefore be evaluated
both for their direct effects on AML cells and also for
their indirect antileukemic effects through nonleukemic
stromal cells. Our present results suggest that such indirect
pharmacological effects on stromal cells may contribute
to the antileukemic effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The PI3K and mTOR inhibitors evaluated in
this study inhibited growth of bone marrow stromal
cells, suggesting that they have indirect antileukemic
effects mediated via the stromal cells. Previous studies
have shown that these drugs have antiangiogenic and
thereby anticancer effects in human malignancies [48,
49], including by decreased expression of both VEGF
and its receptors [48, 50]. However, our results show
that disruption of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can
affect angiogenesis not only via the VEGF system but
also through altered release of several angioregulatory
mediators released both by AML as well as various stromal
cells. Such indirect effects may thus contribute to the
antileukemic activity of these drugs [51]. Finally, another
effect of these drugs seems to be altered leukemia cell
migration [52] that may be caused by effects on stromal
cells cytokine release and possibly affect localization of
AML cells to the growth-enhancing stem cell niches.
The final effect of these drugs on angioregulation
depends on their effects on the local balance between
pro- and antiangiogenic mediators. Our overall results
suggest that these drugs often have a relatively weak
effect on proangiogenic CXCL8 that is released at high
levels by AML cells for most patients; a strong inhibitory
effect on this proangiogenic mediator was only seen for a
subset of patients and an increased release was often seen
for the stromal cells. The drugs had divergent effects on
several other mediators (see Table 5 and Fig. 5) and it is
possible that other growth factors/cytokines involved in
AML-stroma interactions may be targeted by PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors. It is therefore difficult to predict the final overall
effect of these drugs on bone marrow angioregulation,
though in our opinion it seems most likely that the final
effect will differ between individual patients, and for
many patients antiangiogenic effects do not seem to be
a major contributor to the antileukemic effects seen by
the investigated PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors and may also
involve microenvironment-mediated drug-resistance [53,
54].
To conclude, our present results suggest that
disrupting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling can alter the local
bone marrow cytokine network both through effects on
leukemia cells as well as various stromal cells, and these
alterations may directly affect the leukemic cells or
indirectly affect leukemogenesis through altered regulation
of bone marrow angiogenesis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
AML patients and cell preparation
The study was approved by the local Ethics
Committee (Regional Ethics Committee III, University
of Bergen, Norway) and samples collected after written

informed consent. The study included a total of 60
consecutive adult AML patients with high peripheral
blood blast counts (>7 x 109/L). This selection of patients
and the analysis of FLT3 and NPM1 mutations have been
described previously [29, 46]. The major characteristics of
the 60 patients (median age 65.5 years, range 24-84 years)
are summarized in Table 1. AML cells were isolated
from peripheral blood by density gradient separation
(Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) and the final
leukemic cell populations studied contained at least 95%
leukemia blasts. The cells were stored in liquid nitrogen
[29].

tested at concentrations showing biological effects on
primary AML cells, and these effects were not caused
by other constituents of the drug preparation. We wanted
to investigate whether the drugs have combined direct
and indirect (i.e. effects mediated via stromal cells)
antileukemic effects, and for this reason we used the same
drug concentrations in stromal cell experiments as in the
AML cell studies.
Rapamycin.
Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA)
inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 [30]. Initially
we investigated the effect of rapamycin as a tenfold
dilution between 0.01 and 105 nM. All concentrations
caused a similar and statistically significant inhibition
of AML cell proliferation corresponding to 68 % (0.01
and 104 nM) to 77 % (103 nM) of the drug-free controls.
Studies in myeloma cells have also shown a similar
antiproliferative effect when rapamycin was tested over
a similar concentration range [31], and previous in vitro
studies of primary human AML cells suggest that some
patients show no inhibition of mTOR activity when testing
rapamycin at ≤20 nM but with a maximal effect being
reached at rapamycin >50 nM [32]. Based on these overall
data we used rapamycin 100 nM in our experiments.

Normal stromal cells and cell lines
All human cell lines and primary cells were grown
and expanded in their recommended media (distributor’s
information) and obtained from either Deutsche
Sammlung von Zellkulturen und Mikroorganismen
(DSZM, Braunschweig, Germany), American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC Vanassas, MA) or Lonza
(Cambrex BioScience, Walkersville, MD) as stated
below. Primary cells were utilized at passages 2 to 4. The
following cell types were included in the study:
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)
(ATCC no C2517A) and the two arterial endothelial cell
types; HAAE-1 (ATCC no CRL-2472) and HIAE-101
(ATCC no CRL-2478).
Normal bone marrow stromal cells (2M-302; Lonza)
and the fibroblast cell lines HFL1 (ATCCs no CCL-153)
and Hs27 (ATCC no CRL-1634).
Normal osteoblasts (Clonetics, Normal Human
Osteoblast Cell System NHOst, CC-2538) and the two
osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell lines Cal72 (DSZM) and
SJSA-1 (ATCC no CRL-2098).
We also included SAOS (ATCC no HTB-85),
SKES-1 (ATCC no HTB-86), U2OS (ATCC no HTB-96),
which are osteoblastic sarcoma cell lines with an epithelial
phenotype, and the adherent Ewing sarcoma cell line
KHOS-312H (ATCC no CRL-1546).

Temsirolimus.
This rapamycin-derivative (LC Laboratories,
Woburn, MA, US) causes an inhibition of both mTORC1
and mTORC2 when tested at high concentrations
corresponding to 1250 nM [33], whereas detailed
studies in cancer cell lines have demonstrated that for
concentrations up to 500 nM temsirolimus is an mTORC1specific inhibitor [34]. We used temsirolimus at 100 nM;
this concentration is within the range corresponding to
selective mTORC1 inhibition, it has an antiproliferative
effect in primary human AML cells and it has been used
in previous experimental studies [4, 34].
GDC-0941.
This PI3K class I specific inhibitor (Axon Medchem
BV, Groningen, Netherlands) was tested at 100 nM [35,
36].

Pharmacological agents

3-methyladenine (3-MA)
This is an inhibitor of both class I and class III
PI3Ks and its biological effects are caused by effects on
mTOR as well as other downstream targets of Akt [37-40]
3-MA (Sigma-Aldrich Corp. St. Louis, MO) was tested at
1 mM [37-40] and 10mM.

All the drugs were tested in initial dose-response
experiments for primary human AML cells derived
from 15 unselected patients; we then used a highly
standardized 3H-thymidine incorporation assay for
cytokine-dependent proliferation as published in previous
methodological studies [45, 55-57]. All drugs inhibited
AML cell proliferation at the concentrations used in
the present experiments. Stock solutions of rapamycin
and temsirolimus were prepared in dimethylsulphoxide
(DMSO), and pilot experiments showed that DMSO
at the concentrations reached in the experiments did
not affect AML cell proliferation. Thus, all drugs were

Analysis of constitutive release of soluble
mediators by primary AML cells and stromal cells

Ambion, Foster City, CA). Amount and quality of the
biotin-labeled cRNA was controlled both by NanoDrop
spectrophotometer analysis and by using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer before 750 ng cRNA was hybridized to the
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. The HumanHT-12
v4 BeadChip targets 47 231 probes derived primarily from
genes in the NCBI RefSeq database (Release 38).

Culture of AML cells
The methodological approach for analysis of
constitutive cytokine release has been characterized in
detail in previous methodological studies [45, 55-57].
Briefly, AML blasts (2 x 106 cells in 2 ml) were cultured in
24-well culture plates (Costar 3524; Cambridge, MA) for
48 hours in StemSpan SFEM serum-free medium (referred
to as StemSpan; Stem Cell Technologies; Vancouver, BC,
Canada) supplemented with 100 µg/ml of gentamicin.
Supernatants were collected after 48 hours of culture at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Analysis of stromal cell proliferation
Stromal cells (5 x 103 cells/well) were cultured
in flat-bottomed microtitre 96-well plates (NucleonTM
Surface, Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark), with 150 µl
medium per well. All experiments were prepared in
triplicates. Before cells reached confluency, 3H-thymidine
37 kBq per well (TRA 310, Amersham, UK) was added
in 20 µl of 0.9% NaCl solution and nuclear radioactivity
was assayed 24 hours later. Cultures were then transferred
to UniFilter-96 well GF/C plates (PerkinElmer Inc.,
Wellesley, MA), MicroscintTM scintillation fluid was added
(PerkinerElmer Inc.) to air dried plates and radioactivity
was measured using a scintillation plate reader (TopCount
NXTTM, Packard Instruments, PerkinElmer Inc).

Stromal cell culture
The culture conditions for the stromal cells have
been characterized in detail previously [23]. Briefly,
stromal cell populations were cultured in Stem Span
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(FCS) (BioWhittaker, Veviers, Belgium) and 100 µg/ml
of gentamicin in 24-well culture plates (Costar 3524), 2
x 104 cells were then seeded per well. Supernatants were
harvested before the cells reached confluence.

Statistical and bioinformatical analyses

Analysis of soluble mediator concentrations in
supernatants.

All statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
v16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism v5
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA), and p-values
<0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. The data
obtained from the scanning of arrays with the Illumina
iScan Reader were analyzed using GenomeStudio and
J-Express 2012 software for quality control measures
[59]. All arrays within each experiment were quantile
normalized to be comparable and then compiled into an
expression profile data matrix,. Bioinformatical analyses
were performed using the J-Express 2012 analysis suite
(MolMine AS, Bergen, Norway) [59]. The normalized
values were transformed to logarithmic values (base 2)
before analyses, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering
was performed with correlation and distance measure.

Mediator levels were determined using Quantikine
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All assays were performed
strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The minimal detectable levels were CXCL8 3.5 pg/mL,
CXCL9 3.8 pg/mL , CXCL10 1.7 pg/mL, CXCL11 13.9
pg/mL, CXCL12 18 pg/mL, basic fibroblast growth factor
(b-FGF) 3.0 pg/mL, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) 5.0 pg/mL, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 40
pg/mL, angiopoietin (Ang)-1 3.5 pg/mL, Ang-2 8.3 pg/ml,
matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 0.16 ng/mL and MMP-9
0.16 ng/mL and MMP-10 4.1 pg/mL.
