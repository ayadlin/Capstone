BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to describe frequencies and risk factors of altered oral
health and odontogenesis in childhood cancer survivors. METHODS: In total, 9308 survivors who were
diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 and 2951 siblings from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed
a survey that contained oral-dental health information. The authors analyzed treatment impact, socioeconomic data, and patient demographics on dental outcomes using univariate and multivariate logistic
regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, survivors were more
likely to report microdontia (OR, 3.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.4-3.8), hypodontia (OR, 1.7; 95%
CI, 1.4-2.0), root abnormalities (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.2-4.0), abnormal enamel (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.0-2.9), teeth
loss 6 (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.6), severe gingivitis (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5), and xerostomia (OR, 9.7; 95%
CI, 4.8-19.7). Controlling for chemotherapy and socioeconomic factors, radiation exposure of 20 Gray to
dentition was associated significantly with an increased risk of 1 dental abnormality. Dose-dependent alkylating agent therapy significantly increased the risk of 1 anatomic/developmental dental abnormalities
in survivors who were diagnosed at age <5 years (OR, 1.7, 2.7, and 3.3 for alkylating agent scores of 1, 2,
and 3, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for
adverse oral-dental sequelae among childhood cancer survivors. The authors concluded that patients who
received receiving alkylating agents at age <5 years should be closely monitored. Cancer 2009;115:5817–

Original Article

Current multimodality therapies have increased the
survival of patients with childhood cancer. Many of those
therapies are associated with delayed toxicities, resulting in
long-term complications, but to our knowledge little has
been published to date regarding the effects of pediatric
cancer therapy on developing dentition of children.
Reported abnormalities include hypodontia (developmentally missing teeth), microdontia (small teeth), enamel hypoplasia, root stunting, taurodontia (enlarged pulp
chambers), over-retention of primary teeth, an increased
caries index,1-8 malocclusion,9 and decreased temporomandibular joint mobility.10 Local effects of radiotherapy on
craniofacial and dental development have been
described.1,2,11-15 Existing reports have indicated that children may be at greater risks for odontogenic developmental
abnormalities if they are treated with chemotherapy at age
<5 years because of the proliferation of dental stem cells
during this period.14-16 However, the odontogenic toxicities induced by individual chemotherapy agents remain
obscure. Thus, the current report includes data available at
the time of the analysis and describes the types and frequencies of altered dental development in adult survivors of pediatric cancers and associate disodontogenesis with
treatment agents, socioeconomic demographics, and type
of malignancy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Contact
The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a collaborative,
multi-institutional project, funded as a resource by the
National Cancer Institute, of individuals who survived
5 years after a diagnosis of childhood cancer. For participating investigators, see http://www.stjude.org/ccss
(accessed on September 30, 2009).17 Eligibility criteria for
this cohort are 1) a diagnosis of leukemia, central nervous
system malignancy (all histologies), Hodgkin disease,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney cancer, neuroblastoma,
soft tissue sarcoma, or malignant bone tumor (list of eligible International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
codes are available at: http://www.stjude.org/ccss; see Supplemental Information to Previous CCSS Publications
accessed on September 30, 2009); 2) diagnosis and initial
treatment at 1 of the 26 collaborating CCSS institutions;
3) diagnosis date between January 1, 1970 and December

31, 1986; 4) age <21 years at diagnosis; and 5) survival
for 5 years after diagnosis.
The CCSS protocol and contact documents were
reviewed and approved by the Human Subjects Committee at each participating institution. Baseline data were
collected for the study cohort using a 24-page, selfreported questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed
to capture a wide range of information, including demographic characteristics, health habits (smoking, alcohol
consumption, physical activity), frequency of diagnosed
medical conditions, recurrent cancer, and subsequent primary neoplasms. The medical records of all members of
the cohort were abstracted. Detailed data regarding the
chemotherapeutic agents administered to the patient for
treatment of the original cancer and for any recurrences of
the cancer; the cumulative dose of drug administered for
several drugs of interest; and the doses, volumes, and dates
of administration of all radiotherapy were recorded. Of
the 20,626 5-year survivors, 3058 (14.8%) were lost to
follow-up and were never offered enrollment. Of the
remaining 17,568 survivors, 14,363 (81.8%) completed
the baseline survey. Complete medical record abstraction

was successful for 12,492 participants. A random sample
of participating survivors was selected and asked to contact their sibling closest in age to inform them about the
study and invite them to participate. Of the 4790 siblings
selected, 3899 (81.4%) completed a baseline survey.
A follow-up survey was distributed beginning in
2003 that updated information on medical conditions
and included questions regarding dental health (Table 1;
questionnaires are available for review and download at
www. stjude.org/ccss accessed on September 30, 2009). Of
the 11,723 survivors enrolled in CCSS who were not lost to
follow-up, 9308 (79%) completed the 2003 follow-up questionnaire, of whom 8522 had complete treatment data available from the medical record abstraction process and were
included in the current analysis (the questions that were
used for this study are shown in Table 1). Of the 3899 siblings who were eligible for the follow-up survey; 2951
(85%) completed the second follow-up questionnaire; and,
of these, 2831 did not report a cancer event. The current
report includes that were data available at the time of the
analysis from these 8522 survivors and 2831 siblings.

Center at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center. The radiation dose used in the analysis was the
mean dose to 12 points throughout the teeth or teeth bud
region. Dosimetry methods are described fully elsewhere.19
We conducted a cross-sectional comparison of demographic characteristics and dental outcomes between
survivors and siblings using logistic regression models that
were adjusted for potential intrafamily correlation with
robust sandwich variance estimates.20 Sensitivity analyses
were performed to assess the impact of missing or
unknown responses to dental outcomes questions, and we
assumed that all unknown/missing outcomes were either
‘‘no’’ or ‘‘yes’’ responses. Analyses within the survivor
cohort were performed to assess the impact of treatmentrelated and diagnosis-related factors using individuals
who had available treatment data and within the age-atdiagnosis strata birth to 5 years, 6 years to 10 years, and
>10 years. Analyses were conducted in SAS statistical
software (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Statistical Analysis

Of the 8522 survivors in the current analysis, 49.9% were
female, and 86.8% were white non-Hispanic. The median
age at cancer diagnosis was 6 years (age range, birth to 20
years), and the median time from diagnosis to interview
was 22 years (range, 15-34 years) (Table 2). The distribution of survivors by diagnosis and details of treatment
received are shown in Table 3. The majority of survivors
received chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.
Compared with survivors, siblings were significantly more
likely to be white, female, aged 30 years, high school
graduates, to have annual household incomes >$20,000,
and to have health insurance or dental insurance.

Descriptive statistics of demographic and treatment characteristics were calculated for the 8522 survivors and 2831
siblings. Self-reported dental outcomes, including hypodontia, microdontia, enamel hypoplasia, abnormal root development, 6 missing teeth, denture use, dental prosthesis use,
xerostomia, gingivitis, and 6 cavities, were considered in
this analysis. Three additional outcomes were created from a
combination of these individual outcomes and were included
in the analyses. The presence of 1 or more of hypodontia,
microdontia, enamel hypoplasia, abnormal root development, 6 missing teeth, denture use, and dental prosthesis
use was defined as ‘‘at least 1 dental health issue.’’ Similarly,
the presence of at least 1 of xerostomia, gingivitis, and 6
cavities was defined as ‘‘at least 1 soft tissue issue’’; and the
presence of dental bridge use, denture use, or oral prosthesis
use defined the outcome ‘‘at least 1 appliance use.’’
Among the patients who had been exposed to an alkylating agent, the alkylating agent dose score was calculated
by adding the tertile score for each of the alkylating agents
received by a particular patient.18 Radiation dose to the
teeth or teeth buds was estimated for each patient by reviewing and abstracting details of the radiotherapy from radiation oncology records submitted to the Radiation Physics

RESULTS

Comparison With the Sibling Cohort
Compared with the sibling cohort, survivors reported a
higher frequency of all adverse dental outcomes with the
exception of dental bridge use and need for oral prosthesis
(Table 4). However, certain differences were more striking than others. In multivariate analyses that were
adjusted for sex, race, education, annual household
income, health insurance status, and age at study, survivors were statistically significantly more likely than siblings to report dental developmental issues, including
microdontia (9.2% vs 3.3%), hypodontia (8.2% vs

*Models were adjusted for sex, race, education, household income, health insurance, and age at follow-up, which included generalized estimating equation
methods for intrafamily correlations. Additional models, which also included adjustment for dental insurance and dental care use (as a composite), produced
virtually no change in observed ORs. Sensitivity analyses to impact the potential impact of unknown responses also were conducted.

multivariate models that were adjusted for dental insurance and composite dental care use in multivariate models
provided virtually identical odds ratios (ORs) (data not
shown). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate
the potential impact of missing or unknown outcome
responses on associations. Replacement of missing/
unknown responses with all ‘‘no’’ responses resulted in no
qualitative or marked quantitative differences in P values
or point estimates of ORs. The less plausible replacement
of missing/unknown with ‘‘yes’’ responses did result in
reduced ORs for abnormal roots, microdontia, oral prosthesis, and xerostomia, but there were no changes in the
significance of P values.
Use of Dental Services
Acknowledging that the reporting of many dental abnormalities may depend in part on their diagnosis by a dental
healthcare professional, we examined associations
between the use of dental services and socioeconomic factors. We observed no significant difference in the use of
dental services between survivors and siblings (Table 2)
but significantly higher frequencies of both cleaning visits
and seeing a dentist in the past year for individuals who
were white, those with an educational level beyond high
school, those with annual income levels $20,000, and
female (Table 5).

Risk Factors for Dental Abnormalities
To examine the influence of demographic factors (sex,
race/ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (education,
income, insurance status), and the impact of treatment exposure (radiation and chemotherapy, including alkylating
agents, antimetabolites, steroids, and vincristine), we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis (Tables
6, 7). A low frequency of events prohibited analysis of
some outcomes, including the need for oral appliance use.
Increased risk of at least 1 reported dental health issue was
associated with younger age at study, female, white nonHispanic race, educational attainment of high school or
less, and an annual household income <$20,000. With
the exception of age at study and educational attainment
level, similar risks were observed for at least 1 reported
soft tissue issue. The dose of radiation to the teeth had a
statistically significant association with an increased risk
of 1 or more dental health issues (exposure to doses >0
grays [Gy] and <20 Gy: OR, 1.3; exposure to doses 20
Gy: OR, 5.6) and 1 or more soft tissue issues (exposure to
doses >0 Gy and <20 Gy: OR, 1.2; exposure to doses
20 Gy: OR, 2.2). Similarly, increasing cumulative exposure to alkylating agent therapy was associated with an
increased risk of reporting at least 1 dental abnormality
(Table 7).

Treatment factors were examined in these same multivariate models for all ages combined and stratified by
age at cancer treatment. Radiotherapy to the teeth significantly increased the risk of developing 1 or more dental
abnormalities in a dose-dependent pattern (doses >0 Gy
and <20 Gy: OR, 1.3 [95% confidence interval (95%
CI), 1.2-1.5]; doses 20 Gy: OR, 5.6 [95% CI, 3.78.5]). This dose-dependent risk was present within all age
strata, except for survivors who were aged >10 years at diagnosis who received doses >0 Gy and <20 Gy (ages
birth to 5 years: OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5] for doses >0
Gy and <20 Gy and OR, 5.6 [95% CI, 3.7-8.5] for doses
20 Gy; ages 6-10 years: OR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.1-1.9] for
doses >0 Gy and <20 Gy and OR, 9.6 [95% CI, 4.122.4] for doses 20 Gy; and age >10 years: OR, 1.2
[95% CI, 0.9-1.4] for doses >0 Gy and <20 Gy and OR,
4.3 [95% CI, 2.2-8.3] for doses 20 Gy). Investigation of
the risk for specific dental issues according to cumulative
exposure to alkylating agent therapy and for cumulative
dose of cyclophosphamide demonstrated a striking associ5822

ation with increased risk, independent of radiation exposure to the teeth, among survivors who were diagnosed
and treated for their cancer when they were aged <5 years
(Fig. 1).
Although radiation exposure to the teeth and alkylating agent therapy were found to be independent risk factors for dental abnormalities, analyses were conducted to
determine whether there was a potential interaction effect.
These tests indicated that only the outcomes of microdontia (P ¼ .01) and enamel hypoplasia (P ¼ .02) had a statistically significant, interactive effect between radiation to
the teeth and the use of alkylating agents.

DISCUSSION
Delayed toxicities resulting from modern cancer therapy
are recognized increasingly, and many have the potential
to compromise long-term health. Through the CCSS,

associated exposure to alkylating agents, independent of
radiation exposure, as 1 of the primary causes of adverse
dental outcomes in childhood cancer survivors.
Animal studies have demonstrated that alkylating
agents, and specifically cyclophosphamide, are toxic to normal dentinogenesis by their binding to DNA in the
S-phase of mitosis, ultimately resulting in early apoptosis.21-23 The dental effect of cyclophosphamide-induced
cell death predominates in primitive mesenchymal cells
and preodontoblasts of the pulp.24 Resulting outcomes
may reflect the stage of dental development that was occurring at the time of exposure to this agent, such that, the
younger the animal, the greater the effect on dentition.
Upon completion of dental development, mature teeth,
particularly incisors and molars, may exhibit a variety of
abnormalities, including foreshortened root development;
small, soft crowns, abnormal, partially calcified pulp chambers; misshaped teeth; and enamel defects.25-28 Although
findings from animal studies have been supported through
case reports and investigations among small cohorts of pediatric cancer patients,25,29 the current CCSS study defini5824

tively identifies young age and increased exposure to
alkylating agents as risk factors for developmental dental
abnormalities in long-term survivors of childhood cancer.
Altered odontogenesis and exfoliation may be
accompanied by altered dental eruption. In rat studies,
corticosteroids accelerated and cyclophosphamide slowed
the eruption of rat incisors during the normal phase of
eruption; whereas neither drug affected eruption during
the initial, slow phase.30 Because the rapid growth of rat
dentition has been likened to the rapid dental growth and
development in children,23 similar effects also may be
expected to manifest in children who are exposed to this
agent. In fact, a patient is at greater risk for odontogenic
developmental abnormalities if they are treated with
chemotherapy at ages <5 years because of the prolific activity of dental stem cells during this period.14-16 Our
data emphasize the significant vulnerability of developing
dentition in young children when they receive alkylator
therapy. When either cyclophosphamide or the alkylator
index was examined, a dose response was demonstrated
that indicated a greater frequency of adverse dental outcomes with higher exposure to alkylator chemotherapy.
Children aged >5 years failed to demonstrate these findings even at the highest levels of alkylator exposure.
Radiotherapy may alter dental integrity1,2 and craniofacial development.12,31 Xerostomia is a common side
effect during radiation treatment32 and contributes to
altered oral flora, which, in turn, can be associated with an
increased number of caries.33,34 It also has been demonstrated that radiotherapy damages the tooth bud, thereby
causing microdontia, growth retardation of teeth, malocclusion, and arrested root development.1,2,35,36 Atrophy
of underlying soft tissue, enamel hypoplasia, or incomplete calcification also can result. The degree and severity
of these effects depend on the child’s age at diagnosis and
the type and dose of radiation,37-39 as supported by our
current findings. Sonis et al observed that acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors who received 24 Gy of radiation
were affected more severely than those who received 18
Gy.16 We also observed that exposure to radiotherapy
doses >20 Gy contributed to a 4-fold to 10-fold higher
risk of developing dental abnormalities.
Furthermore, we observed that sex and socioeconomic factors were correlated with odontogenic toxicity
after adjusting for treatment differences and also were
associated with significant differences in the use of

healthcare.40 Female sex, white non-Hispanic race, lower
education level, and lower household income level were
associated with an increased risk of adverse dental health
in childhood cancer survivors. In contrast, patients with
higher incomes and more education actually reported
fewer dental abnormalities. An increased risk of dental
abnormalities may reflect decreased access to dental care
(particularly limited access to dentists trained in caring for
these complex patients) and, potentially, decreased use of
preventive care. Individuals of white race, those with educational level beyond high school, income levels

having cleaning visits and seeing a dentist in the last year.
Such an increase in dental care use may result in a greater
likelihood of diagnosis and, hence, knowledge of specific
dental conditions rather than reflecting a difference in
biologic susceptibility. These patients who presumably
have better access to dental care and possibly greater
health awareness also may have received preventative dental care that minimized some adverse outcomes.
In interpreting the results of the current study, it is
important to consider its limitations and strengths. The
validity of self-reported dental abnormalities in this population is unknown. The ability to self-report many

abnormalities described in this report may be dependent
on the level of dental care. Missing teeth, the number of
cavities, and the use of dental appliances are readily apparent to the individual. However, the recognition of abnormalities, such as lack of enamel (enamel hypoplasia),
small teeth (microdontia), and root abnormalities (root
stunting), requires a professional diagnosis. Strengths of
this study include the large survivor and sibling cohorts,
known cumulative radiation and chemotherapy dose
exposures, and long-term follow-up, which allowed us to
conduct a detailed analysis of the factors that contribute
to dental developmental abnormalities.
Our data indicate that children who are aged <5
years when they are exposed to alkylating agents, particularly those who receive high cumulative doses, are at high
risk for developmental dental abnormalities. Although
this may not be avoidable for many patients given the
wide use of alkylating agents in pediatric oncology, these
data can be used to inform parents, patients, and dental
care providers that close monitoring and follow-up of
these children will be necessary. The same caveats hold
true for children who are exposed to radiotherapy to the
teeth, particularly if the dose is >20 Gy. The need for
ongoing, close dental follow-up should be conveyed to
cancer survivors and their parents during therapy and
should be re-emphasized upon completion of therapy.
