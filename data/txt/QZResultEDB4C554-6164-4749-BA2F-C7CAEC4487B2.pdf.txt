ABSTRACT
Understanding the survival mechanism of metastatic cancer cells in circulation
will provide new perspectives on metastasis prevention and also shed new light
on metastasis-derived drug resistance. In this study, we made it feasible to detect
apoptosis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in real-time by integrating a fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based caspase sensor into one in vitro microfluidic
circulatory system, and two in vivo models: zebrafish circulation and mouse lung
metastatic model. Our study demonstrated that fluid shear stresses triggered apoptosis
of breast cancer cells in circulation by elevating the mitochondrial production of the
primary free radical, superoxide anion. Cancer cells with high levels of manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) exhibited stronger resistance to shear forceinduced apoptosis and formed more lung metastases in mice. These metastasized
cells further displayed higher resistance to chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin,
which also generates superoxide in mitochondria. Specific siRNA-mediated MnSOD
knockdown reversed all three phenotypes. Our findings therefore suggest that MnSOD
plays an important integrative role in supporting cancer cell survival in circulation,
metastasis, and doxorubicin resistance. MnSOD can serve as a new biomarker for
identifying metastatic CTCs and a novel therapeutic target for inhibiting metastasis
and destroying doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells.

circulation through several mechanisms: 1) anoikis due
to the detachment of cancer cells from the extracellular
matrix and the disruption of cytoskeleton, which lead to
cell rounding [2]; 2) immune system-mediated destruction,
which is executed by natural killer cells [3]; and 3)
hemodynamic shear stress (SS), which is mainly generated
from the blood flow but also from collisions between
CTCs, blood cells, and endothelial cells lining the vessel
wall. Among these three mechanisms, the most important
one is the effect of fluid SS on the viability of CTCs
because the greatest proportion of CTCs are destroyed by
this mechanical shear force. Previous studies have shown
that cancer cells could be killed in the circulation via
deformation [4–8]. However, the questions of how fluid
SS kills CTCs and how surviving CTCs resist shear force
remain unanswered [9]. Understanding these issues will

INTRODUCTION
Most cancer patients, especially breast cancer
patients, die of metastasis because metastatic tumors are
difficult to remove surgically and often develop resistance
to conventional chemotherapy [1]. In this study, we aimed
to determine whether there is a common mechanism
supporting both metastasis and drug resistance. We
focused on circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as they are the
“seeds” that potentially form metastatic tumors. Cancer
cells can become CTCs by either actively invading
nearby lymphatic vessels and capillaries or passively
shedding into the bloodstream via leaky blood vessels
formed during angiogenesis or surgery. Once tumor cells
enter the bloodstream, most of them are eliminated in the

provide new insights on how CTCs survive SS to establish
distant metastatic colonies.
Metastatic tumors are usually resistant to various
cancer therapies [1]. Current breast cancer treatment
guidelines recommend adjuvant systemic therapy
following surgical resection of the primary tumor to
treat CTCs and micrometastasis. Anthracycline-based
chemotherapy regimens are among the recommended firstline regimens; among them, doxorubicin (DOX) is one of
the commonly used drugs. In spite of such treatments,
distant disease recurrence often occurs. This has been
postulated to be a consequence of tumor resistance to
conventional treatments – a hypothesis further supported
by observations that metastatic disease often responds
less effectively to treatment and is associated with poor
prognoses. There has been extensive research into the
mechanisms contributing to DOX resistance, including the
over-expression of P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistanceassociated proteins [10], and anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [11–13]. However, the reason why the
response rate to DOX in metastatic cancers is only half of
those observed in the primary tumors remains unknown
[14, 15]. We therefore hypothesized that the CTCs that
survived the fluid SS in the bloodstream may possess some
special properties, which help them to become metastatic
and resistant to DOX.
To find connections between cell survival, metastasis
and DOX resistance, we generated breast cancer cells
with different metastatic potentials and engineered those
cells to produce a fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET)-based caspase sensor (sensor C3) [16] for the realtime detection of apoptosis. We also generated three model
systems, including a microfluidic circulatory system for
generating pulsatile fluidic flow, a zebrafish tumor model,
and a mouse lung metastasis model. By integrating the
sensor cells into these three model systems, we identified
an antioxidant enzyme, MnSOD, as a common foundation
supporting cancer cell survival in the circulation and
metastasis, and increasing cell resistance to DOX.

(FRET) between the donor, cyan fluorescent protein
(CFP), and the acceptor, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
(Figure 1A-1C and Supplementary Video S1). In this
study, a cell was defined apoptotic if its FRET effect,
which is the fluorescence emission ratio of YFP to CFP,
was reduced by ≥ 50% (Supplementary Figure S1A and
S1B).
To compare the metastatic ability of the 231-C3
and MCF7-C3 cells, a lung metastasis experiment was
conducted in mice. Cells of equal numbers (5 × 105) were
injected into the tail vein of nude mice. The number of
sensor cells in the lung was counted while no sensor
cells were detected in other parts of the animal 24 hours
after the injection. The 231-C3 cells displayed much
higher viability than MCF7-C3 cells in lung tissue (300400 cells/cm2 vs. almost none) three days after injection
(Figure 1D and 1G). Some 231-C3 cells eventually formed
micrometastases at 45 days (Figure 1D and 1E) and
macrometastases at 90 days (Figure 1F).
To understand why the 231-C3 cells were more
viable than the MCF7-C3 cells in mice, we conducted a
more-detailed, in situ single-cell apoptosis analysis on the
sensor cells found in the lung. The FRET imaging analysis
showed that the apoptotic rate of the 231-C3 cells was
five times lower than the rate of the MCF7-C3 cells (5.8
± 2.6% vs. 30.2 ± 11.0%) (Figure 1H and 1I). Together,
these results show that 231-C3 cells are more metastatic
and durable than MCF7-C3 cells; the results also imply
that most injected sensor cells died during the circulation.

Metastatic cells are more resistant to
hemodynamic SS-induced apoptosis in zebrafish
To investigate how cancer cells were eliminated in
the circulation, we used 3-6 day-old larvae of a transgenic
zebrafish line, Tg (fli1:EGFP), which expresses EGFP
in its vascular system (Figure 2A). Despite its young
age, zebrafish larvae already have a pulsatile blood flow
(Supplementary Video S2). As zebrafish larvae have
transparent bodies, sensor cells can be clearly identified
in different parts of the blood vessels, such as the caudal
artery (CA), caudal vein (CV), and intersegmental vessels
(ISVs) (Figure 2B). ISV diameter is similar to that of
capillaries in adult zebrafish or pulmonary alveoli in mice,
ranging from 5-10 μm, which is smaller than the average
size of a CTC (15-20 μm); CTCs can thus be arrested by
ISVs (Figure 2A, red arrow).
Both two types of sensor cells (50-100 cells) were
injected into the pericardium (Figure 2A, white arrow) of
a larva at 72 hours post fertilization, and approximately
20-50 cells entered the circulation and moved to the tail
region. These sensor cells were observed to circulate
in large vessels such as the CA and CV, subsequently
trapped in small vessels such as ISVs and CV plexus, or

We previously constructed a caspase sensor for
the real-time detection of caspase-3/-7 activation during
apoptosis (Figure 1A) [16]. Recently, we generated
two stable sensor 231-C3 and MCF7-C3 cell lines
from metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and nonmetastatic breast cancer MCF7 cells (Figure 1B) [17].
These sensor cells could change their color from green
to blue under UV-irradiation-induced apoptosis due to

Fluid SS increases the levels of mitochondrial
superoxide in CTCs

returned to circulation via moving through small vessels
(Supplementary Figure S2A). More strikingly, most
MCF7-C3 cells underwent apoptosis in the blood stream
of zebrafish within the first 24 hours post injection,
while most 231-C3 cells survived until 72 hours post
injection (Figure 2C-2E). These results show that nonmetastatic MCF7-C3 cells died much faster through
apoptosis in zebrafish circulation than metastatic 231C3 cells.
Several pieces of evidence suggested that the
injected sensor cells might encounter destructive
shear forces in zebrafish circulation. First, the sensor
cells experienced pulsatile SS in the circulation
(Supplementary Video S2). Second, the rate of 231C3 cell apoptosis increased along with the elevation
of zebrafish heartbeats during the development (Figure
2E and 2F). Third, more 231-C3 cells, compared to
MCF7-C3 cells were found to extravasate (Figure 2G
and 2H) or move from large vessels to ISVs at the tail
region (Figure 2I and 2J, Supplementary Figure S2B
and S2C) and the survival rates of 231-C3 cells located
outside of ISVs at 48-72 hours post injection were
much higher than those of cells that remained inside
(Figure 2K). Finally, no viable cells were found within
large vessels, such as the CA and CV, at 72 hours post
injection unless they had formed a cluster, which might
shelter them from the higher fluid shear forces in large
vessels (Supplementary Figure S2B and S2D).

In our previous studies, we showed that fluid SS
induced endothelial cell apoptosis by elevating reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels [19, 20]. To determine
whether fluid SS has similar effects on CTCs, we measured
the levels of ROS by pre-incubating cells with an ROSdetecting dye, CM-H2DCFDA (10 μM), for 30 minutes
before injecting them into either zebrafish circulation or
a microfluidic system. Because this ROS dye can emit
green fluorescence, we used non-fluorescent, parental
cell lines of sensor cells, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, in
this experiment. Significant increases of ROS level were
detected in both cell types 60-120 minutes after being
injected into zebrafish (Figure 3F) or after 60 minutes of
circulating in the microfluidic system under SS15 (Figure
3G, Supplementary Figure S3A-S3C). Pre-treating cells
with 20 μM propyl gallate (PG) for 60 minutes almost
completely prevented ROS elevation (Figure 3G). Because
PG can scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl radicals [21,
22], we then used a mitochondrial superoxide-specific dye,
MitoSOX Red, to show that fluid SS elevated the levels
of mitochondrial superoxide in both MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cells, regardless of their metastatic abilities
(Figure 3H and Supplementary Figure S3D).

SS causes more mitochondrial damage and cell
death in non-metastatic cells

Fluid SS triggers cancer cell apoptosis in a
microfluidic circulatory system

If SS can elevate the levels of superoxide in both
metastatic and non-metastatic cells, then why does it cause
more damage to non-metastatic cells? To answer this
question, we examined the mitochondria where superoxide
was elevated after circulation. It was found that circulation
damaged the mitochondria of MCF7 cells by reducing
their size and causing the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP), but these damages were not observed in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4A and 4B, Figure 5A and
5B). These phenomena were also not observed in MCF7
cells placed under non-adhesive and static conditions,
indicating that SS is the primary cause of mitochondrial
damage in non-metastatic MCF7 cells (Figure 5A
and 5B). Furthermore, treating MCF7 cells with the
antioxidant PG blocked mitochondrial fragmentation
(Figure 5B). Therefore, we propose that SS mainly
damages non-metastatic CTCs in the following order and
time line: shear stress → ROS generation (≤ 1 hour) →
mitochondrial fragmentation (1-3 hours) → loss of MMP
(6 hours) → cytochrome c release → caspase activation/
apoptosis (8-20 hours) (Figure 5C).
Next, we investigated why SS-produced oxidative
stress damaged mitochondria in MCF7 cells but not
in MDA-MB-231 cells. For the MCF7 cells, which are
sensitive to SS-induced damages, we pre-treated them
either with manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)

To explore the impact of fluid SS on circulating
cells, we designed a microfluidic circulatory system that
uses a peristaltic pump to generate pulsatile shear forces
similar to those produced in human vasculature (Figure
3A, Supplementary Video S3). Three levels of SS, 5, 15
and 30 dyne/cm2, were generated using this system, which
represent venous SS (0.5-4.0 dyne/cm2) and arterial SS
(4.0-30.0 dyne/cm2) in human circulation [18]. Sensor
cells were circulated in this system for different durations,
and their apoptotic status was determined using FRET
imaging through a PDMS-based observation chip (Figure
3A and 3B). Circulatory treatment under SS15 resulted in
a 4-fold higher apoptotic rate in MCF7-C3 than in 231C3 cells (18.9% vs. 4.6%) within 20 hours of circulation
(Figure 3C). A significant increase in apoptotic rates were
observed in MCF7-C3 cells compared with that in 231C3 cells when the SS levels were elevated (Figure 3D
and 3E). More importantly, inhibiting caspase activation
using a pan-caspase inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) or
a caspase-3/-7 inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) significantly
rescued SS-induced cell death (Figure 3D and 3E),
indicating that apoptosis is the major type of cell death
caused by fluid SS.

Heterogeneous expression of MnSOD determines
the survivability of CTCs

porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) to simulate the function
of MnSOD, which can convert mitochondrial superoxide
into hydrogen peroxide [23], or with the antioxidant PG
before circulation. Both treatments significantly reduced
mitochondrial fragmentation, prevented the loss of MMP,
decreased SS-induced apoptosis, and increased cell
viability in MCF7 cells (Figure 4A-4D and Figure 5B).
Furthermore, pre-treating MDA-MB-231 cells with a
superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor, 2-methoxyestradiol
(2-ME) [24], caused them to lose MMP after 6 hours of
SS treatment (Figure 4A and 4B). These results suggest
that antioxidant activity, especially superoxide scavenging,
is required for CTCs to counteract SS-mediated
mitochondrial damage and cell death.

The heterogeneous expression of MnSOD was
further revealed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
in xenograft breast tumors derived from MCF7 or MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 6A). In addition, this heterogeneous
expression pattern of MnSOD was also confirmed by
immunostaining in all four types of breast cancer cell lines
tested in this study, including ER+/HER2-, MCF7 and
T-47D; ER+/HER2+, BT474; ER-/HER2+, SK-BR-3; and
triple negative, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 [25]
(Figure 6B). Very importantly, the two highly metastatic
cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, both had
the highest percentages of MnSOD-positive cells and the
highest levels of MnSOD (Figure 6B and 6C).
To determine the correlation between MnSOD
expression and cell survival in circulation, all six cell
lines were circulated in the microfluidic system under
SS15 for 18 hours. Immunofluorescence staining showed
that although the percentages of MnSOD-positive cells
varied significantly among these cell lines (3-65%),
over 90% of the surviving cells were MnSOD positive
(Figure 6B and 6D). Significantly, a highly positive linear
correlation was found between the number of MnSODpositive cells existed prior to circulation and the number
of viable cells after SS15 treatment (R2 = 0.9614) (Figure
6E). Together, these results establish the important role of
MnSOD in protecting CTCs from SS-induced apoptosis
in circulation.

High levels of MnSOD protect cancer cells from
SS-induced apoptosis
To determine which SOD serves to protect cancer
cells against SS-induced cell death, the levels of two
superoxide dismutase enzymes were determined,
including MnSOD, which is localized in mitochondria
(Figure 5D), and CuZnSOD, which is localized in the
cytosol. Metastatic 231-C3 cells exhibited 2.6-fold more
MnSOD than non-metastatic MCF7-C3 cells, while their
levels of CuZnSOD were similar. In addition, the levels
of these two enzymes showed little variation during 12
hours of circulation (Figure 4E). To study the role of
MnSOD, its expression was repressed using two MnSODspecific siRNA (siMnSOD-1 and siMnSOD-2) in 231-C3
cells (Figure 4F); subsequently, the cells were subjected
to SS15 treatment for 18 hours. Silencing MnSOD
expression significantly increased apoptosis and reduced
the viability of 231-C3 cells to levels similar with those
achieved by using the MnSOD inhibitor 2-ME (Figure
4G and 4H). Furthermore, overexpression of MnSOD
in MCF7-C3 cells resulted in a significant reduction of
apoptosis and elevation of cell viability during circulation
(Figure 4I-4K).
We further substantiated the anti-SS function of
MnSOD by selecting the small population of MnSODpositive MCF7-C3 cells that maintained normal
mitochondrial morphology and retained normal MMP
after 6 hours of circulation (Figure 5E), and further
survived after 18 hours of circulation. These MCF7-S1
cells displayed higher levels of MnSOD, lower rates of
apoptosis and higher percentages of cell survival against
SS treatment compared with those of their parental
MCF7-C3 cells (Figure 5F-5H). All these results support
the notions that MnSOD can protect CTCs from SSinduced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis and that
the expression of MnSOD is heterogeneous among the
populations of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

High levels of MnSOD increase metastatic
potential of breast cancer cells
Next, we examined whether high levels of MnSOD
can increase the metastatic capacity of breast cancer
cells by establishing three generations of 231-C3 cells
(Figure 7A). 231-M1 cells were isolated from lung
micrometastases on the 45 days after 231-C3 cells were
injected into the tail vein of nude mice (Figure 1E). These
231-M1 cells were considered to be more malignant than
the 231-C3 cells, as many more lung metastases with
much larger tumor sizes were formed in five out of six
mice after the mice received an injection of 231-M1 cells
into their circulatory system. Two cell lines were further
isolated from two 231-M1 metastatic tumors, namely, 231M1A and 231-M1B (Figure 7A-7C). IHC analysis showed
that 231-M1 lung metastatic tumors had much higher and
more uniform expression of MnSOD than 231-C3 lung
metastasis (Figure 7D). The 231-M1A and M1B cells
displayed even more homogenous and higher expression
of MnSOD than did the 231-M1 and 231-C3 cells (Figure
7E and 7F).

with 2-4 μM DOX for 24 hours, in which the apoptotic
rates were 2-3-fold higher in the MnSOD siRNA-#1
group compared with those of the control siRNA group
(Figure 9E and 9F, and Supplementary Figure S4). Even
at a low DOX concentration of 2 μM, silencing MnSOD
successfully increased the efficacy of DOX-induced
apoptosis to more than 50% (Figure 9F) and reduced cell
viability to less than 20% in all four cell lines (Figure 9G).
These results suggest that metastatic breast cancer cells
can develop DOX resistance by overexpressing MnSOD
and this resistance can be overcome by reducing MnSOD
expression.

We also compared the levels of MnSOD between
primary and metastatic human breast tumors. Three cases
of invasive breast cancer were identified, and samples
of both primary and metastatic tumors that had formed
at the cervical lymph node, pleura and femur bone after
surgical excision of the primary tumors were obtained.
IHC analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
samples revealed that the metastatic tumors displayed a
higher and more homogenous expression of MnSOD
than did the primary tumors, in which only some of the
tumor cells displayed high MnSOD staining (Figure 8,
red arrows). The patients’ information is summarized in
Figure 8.
To validate the role of MnSOD in supporting
the survival and metastasis of CTCs, the expression of
MnSOD was silenced using siRNA-#1 in 231-C3 and
231-M1 cells before injecting them into the tail vein of
nude mice. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of MnSOD
significantly attenuated the metastatic ability of 231M1 cells to the same low level exhibited by 231-C3
cells (Figure 7H and 7I). These results suggest that
MnSOD plays a very important role during metastasis
by increasing the survival of breast cancer cells in the
circulation.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we discovered an interconnection
between three major events in cancer development and
treatment: CTC survival, metastasis, and resistance to the
first-line anti-cancer agent DOX (Figure 10). These three
events are unlikely to occur independently, but they may
stem from one common origin, which is a high expression
level of MnSOD. We propose that when cancer cells enter
into the circulation and become CTCs, the fluid SS present
in the human artery can increase the levels of superoxide,
which damages mitochondria. For CTCs with lower levels
of MnSOD, they can be killed by SS-induced apoptosis in
circulation. However, cells with higher levels of MnSOD
can survive SS-induced apoptosis and further develop
into metastatic tumors. This explains why MnSOD
expression is both more uniform and higher in metastatic
tumors formed in mice (Figure 7D), in malignant tumors
of breast cancer patients (Figure 8), and in the results of
previous clinical studies [26–28]. We further confirmed
that this high expression of MnSOD can be inherited by
CTC progeny during metastasis. For example, the 231C3 series cells isolated from metastatic tumors exhibited
higher levels of MnSOD compared with their parental
cells (Figure 7A-7F).
MnSOD is the most important antioxidant enzyme,
and in some earlier studies, it was found to suppress
tumor formation [29–31]. However, recent studies have
suggested that MnSOD could enhance the malignancy of
tumor cells by promoting their resistance to anoikis [32]
or by sustaining the Warburg effect [33]. In this study,
we found a new integrative role of MnSOD in supporting
breast cancer CTC survival, metastasis and resistance
to DOX. We made these discoveries by applying
integrative model systems that overcame the technical
limitations in studying cancer cells in the circulation
and detecting apoptosis in real time. For example, a
novel microfluidic circulatory system was developed
to produce physiologically relevant shear forces, which
is better than the previously reported SS-generating
methods using corn-plate viscometers [5, 34, 35] or
syringe needles [4]. Both the zebrafish tumor model [36,

High levels of MnSOD confer resistance to DOX
and knockdown of its expression sensitizes cells
to DOX treatment
Since MnSOD can scavenge superoxide, we
postulated that the 231-C3 series cells, with high levels
of MnSOD, may have a stronger resistance to ROSgenerating agents, such as DOX and radiation. The 231-C3
series cells were treated with 3 minutes of UV irradiation,
1-8 μM DOX, or 200 nM Taxol. The results showed that
231-M1 cells exhibited higher resistance to DOX and UV
irradiation-induced cell death than did 231-C3 cells, but
no higher resistance was observed when these cells were
treated with Taxol, which does not generate ROS (Figure
9A). Furthermore, 231-M1A and 231-M1B cells, with
even higher levels of MnSOD, displayed lower rates of
apoptosis compared with 231-M1 and 231-C3 cells during
DOX treatment (Figure 9B). In particular, after being
treated with 8 μM DOX for 24 hours, the apoptotic rates
among these four cell lines were 76.7% (231-C3), 38.3%
(231-M1), 22.8% (231-M1A), and 13.3% (231-M1B)
(Figure 9B). We confirmed that 4 μM DOX produced
superoxide after 1 hour of drug treatment (Figure 9C),
damaged mitochondria after 3-6 hours of drug treatment
(Figure 9D), and caused MMP reduction and activated
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis after 12 hours (Figure 9D).
SiRNA-mediated MnSOD knockdown significantly
increased the DOX-induced apoptosis in M1, M1A and
M1B cells expressing high levels of MnSOD. This was
especially significant for M1A and M1B cells treated

37] and the experimental metastatic mouse model [38]
were optimized in this study. We then introduced a realtime apoptosis sensor into these systems. By doing so,
we found for the first time that cancer cells circulating
in zebrafish, or in a microfluidic circulatory system,
could be killed by SS-induced apoptosis (Figure 2 and
Figure 3). We also observed that many cancer cells
died via apoptosis in the lung 1-2 days after having
been injected into the circulation of nude mice (Figure
1). More importantly, we found that metastatic breast
cancer cells displayed a stronger ability to survive SSinduced apoptosis because they expressed higher levels
of MnSOD (Figure 4-Figure 7).
MnSOD is specifically localized in mitochondria,
where superoxide molecules are constantly generated as
by-products during the production of ATP [39]. Under
normal conditions, superoxide is retained within the
inner membrane of mitochondria, where MnSOD can
convert it to the less toxic hydrogen peroxide, which
can then diffuse into the cytosol and be converted by
catalase into oxygen and water. Mitochondria usually
maintain a filamentous morphology in attached cells as
they can bind to microtubules. When cells detach and
circulate, the filamentous structure of microtubules will

be affected [40], which may trigger mitochondria to
produce more superoxide. In this study, we found that
superoxide levels quickly increased in mitochondria
after cells had been circulating for less than 60 minutes.
This was followed by a chain of events, including
mitochondrial fragmentation (1-3 hours), loss of MMP
(6 hours) and caspase-dependent apoptosis (8-20 hours),
only in non-metastatic MCF7 cells (Figure 5C) but not
in metastatic 231-series cells. High levels of MnSOD
in the mitochondria were able to scavenge the SSelevated superoxide, thus allowing the metastatic cells
to survive the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis during
circulation.
Another important finding of this study is that high
levels of MnSOD confer resistance to the anti-cancer
agent DOX, which can produce superoxide (Figure 9)
[41–43]. Reducing MnSOD expression using specific
siRNA or inhibiting its activity by using 2-ME increased
the destructive effect of fluid SS (Figure 4). Most
importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of MnSOD
significantly increased the efficacy of DOX (Figure 9).
These results identify MnSOD as a novel marker for
detecting metastatic CTCs and a potential therapeutic
target for killing metastatic breast cancer cells.

Figure 10: Proposed mechanism of MnSOD in supporting cancer cell survival, metastasis and DOX resistance. Both

shear stress and DOX can damage CTCs by producing superoxide, which can damage mitochondria and induce apoptosis. Only the CTCs
with high levels of MnSOD can resist SS-induced cell death as MnSOD can scavenge superoxide. When the surviving CTCs grow into
metastatic tumors, the tumor cells will continue to express high levels of MnSOD, which confer resistant to DOX. Knockdown of MnSOD
sensitizes resistant metastatic breast cancer cells to DOX treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

on a wet agarose microinjection pad. 100-200 cancer
cells were injected into zebrafish larva at 72 hours
post fertilization. Zebrafish imaging and extravasation
analyzing were performed as described previously [37].
Images of cancer cells and zebrafish were captured using
a motorized fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer Z1,
Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with the aforementioned
FRET filters, a computer-controlled camera (AxioCam
MRm, Carl Zeiss, Germany) and operated by Zen 2012
software (Carl Zeiss). The digital fluorescence images
were then processed using Image-Pro Plus software
(Media Cybernetics, USA) to calculate the FRET
effects for determining the apoptotic state of sensor cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). Zebrafish heartbeat was
counted in a 35.5°C chamber under a microscope (Axio
Observer Z1). The same group of fish (n = 5) was analyzed
at different time points, from 4 to 24, as well as 48 and
72 hours post injection, and the average heart rates were
calculated.

Cell culture
Breast cancer cell lines MCF7, BT-474, SK-BR-3
and MDA-MB-468 were purchased from the ATCC. T-47D
and MDA-MB-231 were provided by Prof. Xiaofeng Le
from University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, USA). Cell Line Authentication Services were
performed using short tandem repeat DNA profiling
analysis (Genetica DNA Laboratories, USA). MCF7 cells
were cultured in MEM, BT-474 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640, and the other four cell lines were cultured in
DMEM (Invitrogen, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(HyClone, UK) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco,
USA). MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
with the sensor C3 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, USA). After selection with 500 μg/mL G418
(PAA, Germany), single-cell colonies expressing the
C3 sensor were designated MCF7-C3 and 231-C3 cells
(Figure 1B) [17].

Detection of apoptosis in a microfluidic
circulatory system

Experimental lung metastasis model and
orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice

A microfluidic circulatory system (Figure 3A) was
assembled by using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec, Germany)
to generate a pulsatile flow in a circulatory silicone tubing
(Ismatec, Germany) with a diameter of 500 μm and a
total length of 1.5 m. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)based observation chip was linked with the microfluidic
circulatory system when live cell imaging microscopy
was conducted. SS in the tubing was calculated using
Poiseuille’s equation [4], τ = 4Qη/πR3, where τ is SS
in dyne/cm2, Q is flow rate in cm3/s, η is the dynamic
viscosity of the fluid (the culture medium can be treated
as water at 37°C; η = 0.01 dyne*s/cm2), and R is the
radius of the silicone tubing (250 μm). The flow rate can
be adjusted to achieve SS range from 5 to 30 dyne/cm2.
To prevent cells attaching to the tubing or the PDMS chip,
the whole system was pre-coated with 0.5% Pluronic F127
in PBS (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature
before the experiments. A Pluronic F127-coated, 96-well
plate was also used as a negative control for the no SS
condition.
Cancer cells were collected using 0.05% trypsin
containing 0.53 mM EDTA (Gibco, USA), washed twice
with PBS and re-suspended in fresh culture medium
at a cell density of 2 × 105/ml before injected into the
microfluidic system. One milliliter of cell suspension was
added to the microfluidic circulatory system and subjected
to circulation for varying times at 37°C in a humidified
CO2 incubator. For live cell imaging, the pump was
switched off to stop the medium flow, and the movement
of sensor cells was retained within the observation chip by
closing the two control valves. The rate of apoptosis was
determined by FRET imaging microscopy.

All mouse experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In the
experimental lung metastasis model, a total of 5 × 105
MCF7-C3 or 231-C3 cells were injected into the tail vein
of 6-8-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (BioLasco
Company, Taiwan). After the mice were sacrificed at
the designed times, various tissues were examined
for micrometastases using an MVX10 Fluorescence
MacroZoom System (Olympus, Japan) equipped with
FRET filters (Ex = 436 ± 10 nm; diachronic mirror = 455
nm; Em1 = 480 ± 20 nm and Em2 = 535 ± 15 nm).
Orthotopic xenograft models were generated by
injecting of 1 × 106 MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells in 100
μL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) into the mammary
fat pad of nude mice. For mice injected with MCF7 cells,
one estrogen pellet (1.7 mg per pellet, Innovative Research
of America, USA) was subcutaneously implanted into
each mouse 4 days prior to cell injection. Metastatic 231C3 series cell lines were isolated from micrometastases
or macrometastases on lung by dissection under imaging
system followed by collagenase IV digestion (Sigma)
(Figure 7A).

paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. The slides were then
blocked and stained using the Rabbit-Specific HRP/
DAB Detection IHC Kit (Abcam, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The primary rabbit antiMnSOD antibody (Abcam) was diluted 1:100 in PBST
containing 3% BSA and incubated overnight at 4°C. All
color images of the IHC analysis and H&E staining were
recorded using a color camera (AxioCam 506, Carl Zeiss).

ROS levels were determined by staining cells
with 10 μM CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, USA), and
mitochondrial superoxide levels were determined by
staining cells with 10 μM MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen,
USA)
following
manufacturer’s
instruction.
Mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential
of cells were determined by staining cells with 100 nM
MitoTracker Red-CMXRos (Life Technologies, USA)
following manufacturer’s instruction. Fluorescenceemitting dichlorofluorescein (DCF) were recorded
using a fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer Z1).
Mitochondria stained with MitoTracker Red-CMXRos
were imaged with a LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Germany). MitoSOX fluorescence was measured
immediately using a flow cytometer (LSRII, BD
Biosciences, USA).

Downregulation and inhibition of MnSOD
Validated Silencer Select siRNA against MnSOD
(siRNA No.1: ID s13268; siRNA No.2: ID s13269) and
Silencer Select Negative Control No. 1 siRNA were
purchased from Ambion (Life Technologies, USA).
Before the cells were transfected, 1 × 106 cells were
seeded into 60-mm dishes. After 24 hours, the cells were
washed, and the media was replaced with OptiMEM
(Life Technologies). The cells were then transfected
with 20 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After the overnight incubation, the
transfection complex was replaced with regular complete
DMEM without antibiotics. After 48 hours, the cells were
transfected with siRNA again using the same procedure.
After an additional 48 hours (i.e., 96 hours after the
first transfection), the cells were harvested for further
experiments. To inhibit the activity of MnSOD, 20 μM
2-methoxyestradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to pre-treat
the cells for 1 hour before they were introduced into the
microfluidic circulatory system.

Western blot analysis
Cells were collected with or without treatments,
lysed in RIPA buffer, electrophoreses on SDS-PAGE
and transferred to PVDF membrane. Protein blots were
probed with primary antibodies against MnSOD at 1:3,000
(Abcam, UK), CuZnSOD at 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling,
USA), and GAPDH at 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling, USA),
followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG incubation
at 1:5,000 (Bio-Rad) for 1 hour at room temperature.
The blots were developed using ECL solutions (Thermo
Scientific, USA).

Overexpression of MnSOD in MCF7 cells

Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry
and H&E staining

The pMnSOD plasmid was purchased from Origene
(USA). This plasmid was constructed with a pCMV6Entry vector, and MnSOD was tagged with Myc-DDK
at the C-terminal. The MCF7-C3 cells were transiently
transfected with pMnSOD plasmid or an empty vector
using lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, USA),
according to the manufacture’s protocol. Briefly, 1 ×
106 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes. After 24 h,
the cells were washed and the media was replaced with
serum-free media. Cells were then transfected with 2 μg
MnSOD or vector plasmid DNA plus 5 μl lipofectamine
3000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies). 6 h later,
the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. After transfection for 48 h, the cells were
harvested for further experiments.

For immunofluorescence staining, cells were
cultured in a 12-well removable chamber (Ibidi, Germany).
The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15
minutes, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20
minutes, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS containing 0.3
M glycine for 30 minutes and incubated with rabbit antiMnSOD antibody (Abcam, UK) at a 1:100 dilutions in
PBST containing 3% BSA overnight at 4°C. The cells
were further incubated with TRITC-conjugated secondary
antibody (Calbiochem, USA) at a 1:100 dilutions for 1
hour at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342 before the slides were mounted with
Mowiol® 4-88 (Calbiochem, USA).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were performed
on 5-μm paraffin sections of experimental lung metastases
using standard protocols (Leica). For the IHC staining,
antigens were retrieved using heated citrate buffer
at 100°C for 5 minutes. For the orthotopic xenograft
tumors, 5-μm cryosections were directly fixed with 4%
