Abstract
Tumor formation involves substantial cell division and genetic instability, but the relationship between quiescent cancer
stem cells (CSC) and dividing progenitors in these events is
poorly understood. Likewise, the implication of aneuploid
cells in solid tumors is uncertain. CSCs are postulated to contribute to tumor dormancy and present a formidable obstacle
in limiting treatment outcomes for a majority of cancers,
whereas the genetic heterogeneity conjured by aneuploid cells
may influence tumor drug resistance. However, direct confirmation of these events remains forthcoming. In the present
study, we addressed the identification of tumor dormancy in
terms of isolation of therapy-refractory residual tumor cells
from tumors that persist in a state of quiescence as labelretaining cells. The choices of label were PKH67/PKH26 dyes
that irreversibly bind to the lipid bilayer on cell membranes
and get equally partitioned among daughter cells subsequent
to each cell division. Consequent characterization revealed
that label-retaining cells encompass two different populations
capable of remaining in a state of quiescence, i.e., stem-like
cells and aneuploid cells. The former express a reversibility
of quiescence through retention of functionality and also exhibit therapeutic refractoriness; the latter seem to be either
quiescent or proliferation-arrested at steady-state. Subsequent to exposure to selective pressure of chemotherapy, a
fraction of these cells may acquire the potential to proliferate
in a drug-refractory manner and acquire stem-like characteristics. Collectively, the findings of the present study reveal that
tumor-derived CSCs and aneuploid populations contribute to
drug resistance and tumor dormancy in cancer progression.

Introduction
Tumor dormancy represents a subclinical equilibrium achieved
between host immunity and quiescent residual tumor cells (1), that
can extend for up to decades after treatment followed by disease
relapse (2, 3). Also interpreted as being the minimal residual disease, this state remains a major hurdle in achieving complete remission (4, 5). The exact identity and functional characterization of
cells that contribute to tumor dormancy, i.e., the cellular components of minimal residual disease lesions remain poorly understood. In recent years, the association of tumor dormancy with

cancer stem cells (CSC) has been extensively speculated following
their identification in diverse cancers including breast, brain, ovary, prostate, etc. (6–9), based on their analogy with adult stem cells
in terms of a high capacity for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation (10). A more primeval trait of stem cells in adult organs is quiescence, which is critical in tissue proliferation kinetics
and maintaining tissue homeostasis (11). In an analogous manner,
CSCs are speculated to remain quiescent; tumor dormancy is conjectured to correlate with this quiescent CSC fraction that is likely
to persist posttherapy to drive disease relapse. Aneuploidy—
described as a hallmark of cancer—is associated with proliferation
defects and may impart selective, adaptive advantages under a
specific permissive context to tumor cells (12, 13). This forms a
strong case for aneuploid cells contributing to tumor dormancy.
Unfortunately, a definitive identification of CSC and/or aneuploidyrelated quiescence has remained elusive due to a paucity of experimental data.
Long-term label retention is widely used for the identification of
stem cells (14–16). A standard label-retaining cell (LRC) assay exploits the slow-cycling nature of stem cells (the reason they retain
their labels), whereas rapidly dividing, transit-amplifying (TA) progenitors generated through stem cell self-renewal (17), dilute their
labels. LRCs thus represent experimentally marked slow-cycling
stem cells. Although bromodeoxyuridine labeling of DNA is frequently used in LRC assays, recent studies show its cytotoxic nature (18). The use of membrane-labeling dyes such as PKH67/
PKH26 that have a good correlation with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and slow-cycling cells is suggested (19–21). These vital
dyes consist of a fluorophore attached to an aliphatic carbon backbone that irreversibly binds to the lipid bilayer on cell membranes.
Subsequent to each cell division, the label gets equally partitioned
among daughter cells, resulting in the reduction of fluorescence
intensity (22, 23). PKH labeling enables the monitoring of live cells
and is useful when subsequent functional analysis of labeled cells is
required (24). In the present study, we explored the application of
PKH label retention/quenching as an effective readout for the
identification of quiescent cells in tumors. Such an assessment revealed CSCs and aneuploidy as two contrasting nonproliferative
states in tumors that can be coaxed into regeneration, thereby providing a novel understanding of the cellular determinants of tumor
dormancy.

Cell lines, cell culture, and PKH labeling of cells. A4 cells used in the
study were established earlier in our lab from malignant ascites of a patient
diagnosed with grade 4 serous ovarian adenocarcinoma (10). Paclitaxelresistant A4 cells (A4CR) were developed from parental A4 cells using standard procedures (25). Human tumor cell lines NT2, PA1, HL60, C6, U87, and
T47D were obtained from the National Centre for Cell Science Repository
and maintained as recommended. PKH labeling was performed as described earlier (24).

Animal housing, generation of tumors, and paclitaxel treatment.
Nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice
were bred and maintained at the Experimental Animal Facility, National
Centre for Cell Science; all procedures were done in accordance with institutional ethical animal committee clearances, laws, and policies. Animals
were kept under sterile airflow conditions during the experiment. For subcutaneous tumor formation, either 4 × 106 unlabeled A4 cells (control
group), or 4 × 106 PKH26 or PKH67-labeled A4 cells were injected s.c. into
the thigh of 5- to 6-wk-old female NOD/SCID mice. Drug treatment of mice
was with 25 mg/kg of paclitaxel, whereas vehicle control mice were exposed to DMSO (26). Further details of animal experiments are provided
in the Supplementary Methods.
Tumor digestion for flow cytometry and analysis. Tumors were finely
minced and subjected to collagenase digestion (collagenase IA and collagenase XI—both 5 mg/mL in RPMI medium) to obtain single-cell suspensions. CD44/c-kit staining and Ki67 staining were performed using
standard protocols. PKH-based sorting was performed on FACSAria
(Becton Dickinson) for semiquantitative PCR, quantitative PCR, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity analyses. PKH intensity plots of labeled tumors
yielded a continuous gradient of cells with high intensity similar to preinjected cells to cells devoid of label. PKHhi, PKHlo, and PKHneg fractions were
identified, gated, and sorted from this continuous gradient for subsequent
analyses. Data analysis was with FACSDiva software.
Demarcation of euploid and aneuploid populations and distribution analysis of their cell cycle phases. Propidium iodide (PI)–based
DNA content analysis does not resolve G0 and G1 cell cycle phases, which
is achieved through Hoechst (DNA content)-Pyronin Y (RNA content) staining. Briefly, cells were stained using Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/mL for 45 min, at
37°C in staining buffer); 1 μg/mL of Pyronin Y was added and cells were
incubated for an additional 45 min prior to washing and flow cytometry.
Although Hoechst-Pyronin Y staining was applied for the identification of
quiescent diploid stem cells from normal organs; it was not applied to
tumor-derived cells that had heterogeneous DNA content. Our analysis of
tumors indicated that whereas this staining enabled the demarcation of
quiescent (G0), euploid (P1), and quiescent (G0) aneuploid (P2) fractions,
euploid S − G2/M and aneuploid G1 phases (P4) merge on the histogram.
Another drawback is that S − G2/M phases are not resolved within the P5
fraction. PI staining however permits a lucid demarcation of S − G2/M
phases of euploid and aneuploid fractions. Thus, towards complete cell
cycle profiling, both methods were performed, analyzed independently,
and further overlapped to identify the frequencies of individual phases in
euploid as well as aneuploid populations.
Semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed under standard conditions as described earlier (24).
Statistical analysis. Unless mentioned otherwise, all experiments were
carried out in triplicate; data are expressed as mean ± SEM of at least three
independent experiments. The significance of difference in the mean values
was determined using two-tailed Student's t test. P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
Differential label retaining capacities suggestive of proliferation heterogeneity are expressed by cells within primary
tumors and metastases. To visualize LRCs by flow cytometry,
ovarian cancer cells (A4) were labeled with the membrane dye
PKH67 and injected s.c. into NOD/SCID mice for tumor formation
(Fig. 1A, horizontal column; Materials and Methods). Analyses of
3-week-old tumors (n = 11) for distribution of PKH intensity
revealed a continuous gradient of cells with fluorochrome PKH67
retention ranging from high (PKHhi, equivalent to preinjected
cells), low (PKHlo cells), to total label quenching (PKHneg; Fig. 1A,
vertical column). Such profiles could be consistently identified in all
tumors (n = 25) ranging from short-term (2 weeks) to fairly longterm (6 weeks). However, the cell distribution frequencies of each

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (24). December 15, 2009

fraction varied between short-term and long-term tumors, with the
size of the PKHhi fraction diminishing with tumor progression
(Supplementary Fig. S1A); this could partly be an effect of increasing tumor mass with time. Ovarian cancer progression is characterized by the formation of malignant ascites and the development
of secondary peritoneal tumors; the A4 cells model this pattern in
immunocompromised mice (10). Our next attempt was to decipher
label retention during tumor progression. PKH67-labeled A4 cells
were injected i.p. in NOD/SCID mice; 40 days postinjection, multilayered spheroids, single cells within the ascites and secondary tumors, were collected, digested, and analyzed by flow cytometry
and/or immunofluorescence. All metastases-derived cells showed
the three cell fractions differentiated on the basis of their label retention (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To further elucidate whether the
PKH-based gradient identified in A4-derived tumors is cell type–
specific or represents a general scheme during tumor formation,
we analyzed 3-week-old tumors (n = 3) generated in NOD/SCID
mouse models from PKH67-labeled C6 cells (a rat glioma–derived
cell line). Consequently, the three fluorochrome-based cell subsets
differentiated in A4 cells were also identified in C6-derived tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Because label quenching is a direct function of fluorochrome dilution following each consecutive cell division, the profiles generated are strongly suggestive of the
subsistence of proliferative heterogeneity within primary tumors
and their metastases consisting of three distinct populations: (a)
label-retaining PKHhi cells suggested to be slow-cycling/quiescent,
(b) PKHlo cells that undergo partial label dilution indicative of limited divisions, and (c) PKHneg cells that undergo total dye quenching suggestive of consecutive, rapid divisions.
Label-retaining PKHhi cells exhibited the highest self-renewal
potential and stem cell marker expression. To correlate between
slow-cycling, proliferation, and self-renewal capabilities, the three
freshly sorted PKH tumor cell fractions were subjected to colony
formation assays in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. The clonogenic potential of PKHhi cells was significantly higher than that
of PKHlo cells, whereas the PKHneg subset lacked colony formation
potential (Fig. 1B, top). In vivo, the high tumorigenic nature of the
PKHhi subset was clearly shown wherein only 5,000 cells were capable of initiating and developing tumors in all animals injected
(Fig. 1B, bottom). The minimal threshold of tumor initiation for
the PKHlo subset was ∼10,000 cells; whereas PKHneg cells failed
to display tumorigenic potential. These analyses indicated that
the tumor-initiating capacity of the A4 population lies primarily
within the PKHhi, and to a lesser extent, in the PKHlo subset.
The three tumor cell subsets were also screened for expression
of stem cell markers Oct4, Nestin, Nanog, and Bmi. Oct4 and Nestin
expressions were exclusively associated with the PKHhi subset,
whereas Nanog and Bmi were expressed in PKHhi and PKHlo subsets with expressions being higher in the former (Fig. 1C, top). The
PKHneg subset lacked expression of all four markers. On studying
the association of a recently described cell surface phenotype of
ovarian CSCs (CD44+/c-kit+; ref. 27) with the three tumor cell subsets, these expressions were totally absent in the PKHneg subset,
whereas 68% of PKHlo and the entire PKHhi subset were enriched
for double-positive expression (Fig. 1C, bottom). We also probed
the expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (expressed in late
G1, S, and G2/M phases of cell cycle) in these fractions. Approximately half (57%) of the PKHlo subset and 7% of PKHhi and 7.1% of
PKHneg cells expressed Ki67 (Fig. 1D). In totality, our results suggest that the PKHhi subset represents label-retaining, slow-cycling
stem-like cells; the PKHlo subset as a progenitor population (most

The PKHlo subset comprised of proliferation-arrested aneuploid cells and euploid progenitor cells. PI-based cell cycle analyses of 3-week-old tumor-derived cells further confirmed the

expression analyses (Fig. 2A). Although the PKHlo fraction seems
to represent the immediate progeny of PKHhi CSCs, a striking feature revealed from the PI profiles was that a major fraction of these
cells expressed enhanced ploidy levels (DNA content 4N or more as
compared with baseline A4 euploid DNA levels). Such aneuploid
cells were also present in the PKHhi population albeit to a lesser
extent, but did not appear in the PKHneg fraction. The absence of
such cells prior to injection (Supplementary Fig. S2A) suggested the

association of in situ tumor development with genetic instability
and rearrangements that could lead to the emergence of aneuploidy. These processes are identified as hallmarks of tumorigenesis
(12); however, their existence was further affirmed through DNA
content analysis of primary ovarian cancer samples (eight tumors
and one malignant ascites) that harbored 1.87% to 6.74% (mean =
4.16 ± 1.54%) aneuploid cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). To
further correlate between ploidy levels and cell cycle phases, we
supplemented the PI-generated profiles with those generated
through Hoechst-Pyronin Y staining. The various cell cycle phases
of euploid and aneuploid populations were gated based on their
DNA content as indicated (Fig. 2B), and included—P1 (euploid G0),

P2 (aneuploid G0), P3 (euploid G1), P4 (aneuploid G1 + euploid
G 2 /M), and P5 (aneuploid S + G 2 /M). Combinatorial PI and
Hoechst-Pyronin Y analysis clearly revealed the lack of an S phase
within the aneuploid population along with the persistence of large
fractions of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, thereby suggesting the
subsistence of proliferation arrest within the aneuploid compartment of tumors (Fig. 2C). Most significantly, a distinct fraction of
quiescent (G0) aneuploid cells was consistently detected in all the
tumors analyzed.
To confirm the correlation of aneuploidy with cell cycle arrest,
we examined the transcript levels of cell cycle inhibitors (p14, p16,
p21, p27, and p57) and MDM2 (negative regulator of p53) within

arrest, respectively (28, 29), were found to be elevated in the PKHlo
subset; significant upregulation of p27 in the PKHhi CSCs and not
by the PKHneg cells provided the subtle distinction between cell
cycle exit of quiescent PKHhi versus that of differentiated PKHneg
subsets (Fig. 2D). Final validation of the proliferation inability of
the tumor-derived aneuploid cells within the PKHlo subset came
from their lack of proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2D) and low
clonogenic index when brought into culture (Supplementary
Fig. S2E). The former was derived from the fact that upon sorting
the PKHlo subset from A4 tumors (n = 3), and maintenance in culture, a complete depletion of the aneuploid fraction was evident
within a few passages. Collectively, these results identify a prolifer-

ation arrest in the aneuploid cell fraction in tumors. This data is in
concordance with recent studies that identify a negative role for
aneuploidy in cellular proliferation (13).
Chemotherapy leads to the enrichment of quiescent CSCs
that retain their functionality upon removal of selective pressure. The identification of CSCs as LRCs that undergo reversible
quiescence provided the first indication of their involvement in tumor dormancy. Furthermore, the survival and persistence of their
functionality during therapeutic regimes would provide a defining
validation. We thereby assessed the outcome of chemotherapy on
the quiescent, label-retaining PKHhi subset in drug-treated tumors.
NOD/SCID mice injected (s.c) with PKH-labeled A4 cells were subsequently administered paclitaxel under two treatment regimes,

i.e., short-term and long-term exposures (STDE and LTDE, respectively; Fig. 3A, left), whereas vehicle control groups were treated with
DMSO (Materials and Methods). Drug effects were not evident in
STDE, because the tumor size remained comparable to those in
the controls (Fig. 3A, right). However, under LTDE, tumors stopped
growing, and marginally reduced in size as compared with those at
3 weeks indicating long-term cytotoxic effects. Thus, higher treatment efficacies are suggested in the LTDE over STDE group.
If the quiescence of CSCs operates like a safeguard mechanism
against therapy, drug exposure could lead to the accumulation of
LRCs. Our results conformed to this reasoning as paclitaxel administration augmented PKHhi cells within STDE and LTDE tumors
(Fig. 3B, left and right). It is likely that the elevated numbers of
PKH hi CSCs in STDE tumors represent an initiation of druginduced enrichment that is further enhanced on continuing treatment in LTDE tumors. We had earlier determined that the PKHhi
label is retained for up to three to four divisions in vitro, after
which it undergoes quenching to enter the PKHlo fraction (Supple-

mentary Fig. S3A). An active enrichment of CSCs involving self-renewal through a few minimal divisions is thus possible without
inducing sufficient PKH label quenching that could drive these
cells into the PKHlo subset. Cell cycle analyses (PI staining) of
A4-derived STDE and LTDE tumors showed enhanced G0-G1 in
the euploid fraction (Fig. 4A, left); consequent Hoechst-Pyronin Y
analyses elucidated that a significant amount of increase localized
to the G0 rather than in the G1 phase (Fig. 4A, right). This analysis
further supported the fact that tumor treatment leads to the accumulation of euploid cells in a quiescent state. Subsequent clonogenicity analysis of sorted PKH hi cells from STDE and LTDE
tumors showed posttherapy reversion of drug-induced quiescence
in tumor-derived PKHhi cells that retained their functionality (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This, along with a significant increase in the
PKHhi subset in drug-exposed tumors supports our perception
that the augmentation of quiescent cells within drug-treated tumors involves active enrichment of functional CSCs and is not a
consequence of drug-mediated accumulation of label-retaining

senescent or apoptotic cells. Recently, the role of transcription
factors Snail and Slug in enriching CSCs under radioresistance
and chemoresistance was reported from our lab (28); chemoresistant A4 cells (termed A4CR, resistant to 400 ng of paclitaxel; LD50
for parental A4 cells was 60 ng) were shown to harbor higher
frequencies of CSCs as compared with parental cells at steadystate. In the current study, we identified that these drug-resistant
cells also exhibited a higher label-retention capacity in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and in vivo (Fig. 3C); however, A4CR-derived
tumors under a paclitaxel regime do not undergo further LRC
enrichment and were not growth-restricted (size) as compared
with control tumors (Fig. 3D). This reflects a drug-tolerant stage
under which chemoresistant cells achieve steady-state tumor
growth.
Chemotherapy coaxes aneuploid cells out of their quiescent/proliferation-arrested states due to selective pressure.
Our observations in developing tumors were that aneuploid cells
tend to accumulate in the PKHlo subset either due to quiescence
or proliferation arrest. This identifies them as potential cellular
candidates that could contribute to tumor dormancy, survival,
and regeneration. In assessing this postulate, we studied the outcome of chemotherapy on these cells in drug-treated tumors as

above (STDE and LTDE). Although the number of aneuploid cells
seemed to decrease under both paclitaxel treatment regimes, cell
cycle analyses revealed the emergence of a distinct S phase fraction
within the aneuploid subset (Fig. 4A, left). Furthermore, HoechstPyronin Y resolution identified a higher fraction of cells in G0 and
S − G2/M phases (Fig. 4A, right). Combining these analyses, we concluded that a redistribution of aneuploid cells occurs upon exposure to paclitaxel, leading to an increase of cells in G0 and S phases,
and decreased G1 and G2/M phases (Fig. 4B). This is a major difference between control tumor-generated aneuploid cells that
were likely to be arrested in G0-G1 or G2/M phases (Fig. 2A), and
those in paclitaxel-exposed tumors that seem to re-enter the cell
cycle albeit at very low frequencies, whereas a major portion of
these cells might be affected by the drug. The reduction of posttreatment aneuploidy in the PKHlo fraction may thus be attributed
to a reinstating of proliferation-induced label quenching within
this population that was previously trapped within the PKHlo subset (Supplementary Fig. S4C). A functional evaluation of this potential in aneuploid fractions P2 (G0) and P5 (S + G2/M) sorted from
paclitaxel-treated tumors based on Hoechst-Pyronin Y staining,
identified increased clonogenic potential as compared with untreated tumors (Fig. 4C). Further profiling the DNA content of

colonies formed in vitro by these fractions confirmed the cycling of
aneuploid clones (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Quiescence prevents stem cell exhaustion in normal tissues (30).
In contrast to other nonproliferative states (terminal differentiation/senescence), only quiescent stem cells retain the ability to resume proliferation (31). Thereby, quiescence and its reversibility
become defining parameters of stem cells. These characteristics
have been speculated on extensively in the context of CSCs, especially with regard to drug evasion, but has never actually been
experimentally shown. Thereby, the objectives of the present study
were to (a) develop a convenient readout for the identification of
quiescent cell fractions in an experimental model of tumor development, (b) functionally characterize these quiescent populations
that distinguish them from other nonproliferative states, and (c)
analyze their effects under drug treatment.
Through a convenient readout of label retention, we thus
showed that stem cell activity is enriched in the quiescent fraction
of a tumor that shows the capability to revert to a state of selfrenewal and regeneration. Classically, CSC isolation from tumors
exploits the detection of cell surface markers associated with normal stem cells. However, disparities in such approaches have been
noted (32, 33), especially because quiescence has not been shown
in these cells. Moreover, although surface markers provide obvious
advantages, a single phenotype cannot account for the heterogeneity within CSC populations (34–36). Our results further indicate
that a specific surface expression may not be exclusively associated
with CSCs, but also encompasses progenitor and aneuploid populations. In understanding the events that lead to tumor dormancy,
it is imperative to subject putative CSCs to a functional assessment
such as quiescence and/or drug resistance capabilities rather than
surface phenotypes. Besides harboring CSCs, most solid tumors
contain aneuploid populations that represent genetically diverse
cell pools with reduced cell proliferation and cellular fitness (13).
In a small subset of such cells, however, cellular imbalances associated with increased mutation rate, gene amplification, and/or genomic instability have linked aneuploidy with tumor dormancy
(37, 38). On this background, our observations clearly illustrate
(a) the stem-like potential of tumor-derived LRCs to survive, persist, and retain functionality through drug regimes; thereby contributing to tumor dormancy; and (b) acquisition of proliferation
potential by quiescent/cell cycle–arrested aneuploid cells through
a re-entry into the cell cycle to contribute to disease progression.
Chemotherapy-imposed selective pressures could trigger this response which exploits intrinsic survival capabilities to finally result
in a phenotypic switch. Additional acquisition of stem-like characteristics by such a clone ensures its long-term survival and potential contribution to tumor dormancy (Fig. 5).
Prompted by the detection of LR-CSCs within tumors, we also
attempted to detect LRCs in cancer cell lines in vitro. Towards this
end, the A4 cells were membrane-labeled with PKH, cultured and
harvested at regular intervals (48 hours) for analyses of label intensities by flow cytometry. By 78 hours, a large bulk of cells underwent
quenching of label intensity (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Two groups
could be demarcated within the bulk cells based on differential label
intensities that correspond with different proliferation rates; we
termed these two populations as lagging (slow) and leading (fast)
groups (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). However, these subtle
proliferative differences in vitro did not seem to have the same sig-

nificance as quiescent cells in situ, as further monitoring revealed
that the entire population of cells in culture underwent a complete
quenching of label by 264 hours (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In
addition to A4 cells, we also analyzed the proliferation profiles of
NT2, C6, U87, HL60, PA1, and T47D cell lines. All these cells, under
defined culture conditions, showed an analogous pattern of proliferation marked by the absence of LRCs/PKHhi subset (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Thus, in contrast to their growth in situ, cultured cells
seem to be devoid of LRCs, probably due to use of culture conditions
optimized for cell proliferation. As a corollary, tumor-derived quiescent PKHhi cells, when brought into culture, showed a high clonogenic capability. The intrinsic quiescence of cells in vitro is however
not irreversibly lost, but can be recapitulated in situ where niche
elements exert their instructive role. Thereby, the “stem-like” cells
in tumors result from effects of intrinsic and extrinsic elements
during tumor formation. A similar situation is observed in case
of aneuploid cells that are associated with developing tumors
and do not proliferate rapidly in culture. Our observations receive
support from previous studies proposing that the reciprocal interaction between the tumor cells and microenvironment controls the
switch between proliferation and quiescence (3, 39, 40).
Quiescent LR-CSCs undergo intermittent divisions leading to
self-renewal and generation of rapidly proliferating TA progenitors
(that reside within the PKHlo subset and subsequently give rise to
the bulk tumor—PKHneg cells; Fig. 5). Genetic instability during
such divisions may also generate aneuploid CSC progenitor clones
(38). These aneuploid populations, akin to the CSCs, also constitute a dormant subset within tumors either through quiescence
or a proliferation arrest. Therapy may eradicate TA cells because
most drugs target proliferative cells; concurrently, the differentiated bulk tumor cells also perish, ultimately leading to tumor shrinkage. Thus, drug exposure leads to two possibilities—a dormant
aneuploid clone refractile to drug effects might emerge to drive aggressive disease progression, or remission ensues, reflecting an initial high therapeutic efficacy. However dormant, therapy-refractive
CSCs and aneuploid CSCs may persist within the host as minimal
residual disease. The triggering of these cellular elements defining
tumor dormancy from their state of quiescence is not understood
as yet, but their capability to lead to disease relapse is recognizable
from the results presented here.
Our findings also indicate that the cellular dormancy program in
tumor-derived LR-CSCs and aneuploid cells might be dominant
over oncogenic signaling, thereby ensuring their survival in a quiescent state. Tumor dormancy complements the selection of a chemoresistant clone that is likely to be aneuploid to provide the
genetic variability for drug-resistant growth and acquisition of
stem cell characteristics. Several mechanisms are possibly involved, e.g., expression of multidrug resistance proteins, increased
resistance to drug-mediated apoptosis, tumor stroma–mediated
acquisition of drug resistance, etc. (41–43). From a clinical perspective, our findings illustrating the contribution of CSCs and
aneuploid populations to tumor dormancy has significant therapeutic implications, but presents a major challenge because the
multidrug resistance exhibited by the CSCs and unstable karyotype confers intangible, adaptive advantages to aneuploid cells.
Thus, it becomes increasingly important to further decipher
the interactions and systemic signals that govern the maintenance of the dormant state and the switch between dormancy
and proliferation in these cells, including exploiting the putative
niche that nurtures the CSCs and their aneuploid progeny as
drug targets.
