Abstract
Wnt signaling is important for normal cell proliferation and
differentiation, and mutations in pathway components are
associated with human cancers. Recent studies suggest that
altered wnt ligand/receptor interactions might also contribute to human tumorigenesis. Therefore, agents that
antagonize wnt signaling at the extracellular level would be
attractive therapeutics for these cancers. We have generated
a soluble wnt receptor comprising the Frizzled8 cysteine-rich
domain (CRD) fused to the human Fc domain (F8CRDhFc) that
exhibits favorable pharmacologic properties in vivo. Potent
antitumor efficacy was shown using the mouse mammary
tumor virus-Wnt1 tumor model under dosing conditions that
did not produce detectable toxicity in regenerating tissue
compartments. In vitro, F8CRDhFc inhibited autocrine wnt
signaling in the teratoma cell lines PA-1, NTera-2, Tera-2, and
NCCIT. In vivo, systemic administration of F8CRDhFc significantly retarded the growth of tumor xenografts derived from
two of these cell lines, PA-1 and NTera-2. Pharmacodynamic
markers of wnt signaling, identified by gene expression
analysis of cultured teratoma cells, were also modulated in
the tumor xenografts following treatment with F8CRDhFc.
Additionally, these markers could be used as indicators of
treatment efficacy and might also be useful in identifying
patients that would benefit from the therapeutic agent. This is
the first report showing the efficacy of a soluble wnt receptor
as an antitumor agent and suggests that further development
of wnt antagonists will have utility in treating human cancer.

Introduction
Wnt signaling is a complex process involving several cell surface
receptors and intracellular intermediates (1, 2). The wnt pathway
is activated by the binding of wnt ligands to two classes of cell
surface receptors, the Frizzleds (Fzd) and the low-density
lipoprotein receptor–related proteins, LRP5 and LRP6. The resulting signaling cascade leads to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of h-catenin, the key effector molecule of the wnt pathway.
Wnt signaling is a critical regulator of cell fate during differentiation and development of the embryo (3). In adults, wnt signaling
regulates self-renewal and regeneration of tissues such as skin,

intestine, and hematopoietic cells, through processes dependent on
stem cell function (4).
The wnt pathway was originally implicated in tumorigenesis
with the observation that activation of the wnt-1 gene by insertion
of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) resulted in
mammary gland tumor formation in mice (5, 6). Since then,
several studies have shown a role for the wnt pathway in human
tumors (7, 8) and experimental cancer models (9, 10). The
strongest evidence for a causal role of the wnt pathway in human
cancer development comes from extensive studies showing that
intracellular wnt signaling intermediates are mutated in different
human tumors (7, 8, 11). These include inactivating mutations and
hypermethylation of the APC gene, activating mutations in the
b-catenin gene, and inactivating mutations in the Axin genes.
Mutational activation of wnt signaling in cancer culminates with
hyperactivation of TCF/LEF transcription factors through their
interaction with h-catenin. The wnt signaling pathway also
regulates the expression of genes that control cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, and tissue invasion, and
thus, directly plays a role in tumor development and progression
(7, 8).
In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that
altered expression of wnt ligands, receptors, and extracellular
antagonists might be associated with human cancer development and progression. Wnt genes are overexpressed in tumor
samples (12, 13) and autocrine signaling by wnt ligands has been
reported in human cancer cell lines (14, 15). Expression of the
fzd receptors (12, 16) and LRP5 (17) is increased in some
cancers, whereas overexpression of LRP6 increases tumor cell
growth in vivo (18). Additionally, genes for the secreted wnt
antagonists Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1; ref. 19), secreted
Frizzled-related proteins (sFRP; refs. 20, 21) and Dickkopf
proteins (Dkk; ref. 22) are down-regulated or inactivated in
human cancers. WIF-1 and sFRPs directly bind wnt ligands and
inhibit their interaction with the fzd receptors, whereas Dkk1
binds the wnt coreceptors LRP5/6 and cause their internalization and degradation (23).
The role of altered wnt signaling at the receptor-ligand level
in human tumorigenesis is further strengthened by reports that
extracellular wnt antagonists display antitumor activity in vivo.
Treatment with anti-wnt antibodies (24, 25) and transfection of
cDNAs encoding wnt inhibitors such as the cysteine-rich domain
(CRD) of fzd7 (26), sFRP1 (14), sFRP3 (27), and a dominantnegative form of LRP5 (27) reduces tumor growth in various
in vivo models. In this study, we have explored the pharmacologic utility of a soluble wnt receptor that inhibits wnt
signaling as an antitumor agent. Our results provide direct
evidence that specific extracellular antagonists of wnt signaling
can reduce tumor growth and have potential use as anticancer
therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Generation of Fzd8CRD expression constructs. The cDNA for murine
residues 1–173 of Fzd8 was cloned by PCR, and the cDNA encoding residues
1–155 and 1–173 were subcloned into a pRK-derived plasmid for
mammalian expression. In both constructs, the NH2-terminal CRD of
Fzd8 was fused to the human IgG (hFc) effector domain (28) via a short
linker region including the residues Leu-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Thr, to
create the Fzd8-hFc fusion construct. The amino acid sequences of murine
and human Fzd8 were identical over this region.
Protein isolation and analysis. The human CD4 protein fused to the
human IgG domain was used as a nonspecific control protein (29) for all
in vivo and in vitro studies. The wnt3a protein used for in vitro assays was
purified from L cells transfected with mouse wnt3a (American Type Culture
Collection) as previously described (30).
The Fzd8(1–173)hFc and F8CRDhFc proteins were expressed in
transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and isolated by affinity
capture using ProSep (Millipore) protein A–conjugated resin. Higher order
aggregates were separated from dimers by gel-filtration over a Superdex 200
column (GE Healthcare). Protein identity and NH2-terminal sequences of
the proteins were confirmed by Edmund degradation. SDS-PAGE analysis
showed that the F8CRDhFc protein was >95% pure with no significant
degradation and with endotoxin levels <1.0 EU/mg (data not shown). Multiangle laser light scattering showed the protein to be monodispersed with a
molecular weight of 95 kDa (data not shown).
BIAcore analysis of wnt3a binding to F8CRDhFc was carried out using
immobilized F8CRDhFc and injecting wnt3a as previously described (31).
F8CRDhFc protein was amine-coupled to a Biacore CM5 sensor chip
(BIAcore, Inc.) to achieve f9,000 response units of coupled protein.
Purified human wnt3a was injected at 0.5 Ag/mL and binding assessed by
the change in response units as a function of time. Escherichia coli–
expressed wnt3a was used as a negative control for binding. All procedures
after protein immobilization were conducted in PBS with 1 mmol/L of
CaCl2 and 1% CHAPS.
Mammalian cell culture, transfection, and luciferase assays. Human
kidney epithelial 293 (HEK293) cells and human ovarian PA-1 cells were
grown in 50:50 high-glucose DMEM and Ham’s F12 with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Human teratoma–derived NTera-2 and Tera-2 cells were
maintained in McCoy’s medium with 15% FBS, whereas NCCIT cells were
maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS.
For luciferase assay transfections, 5  105 HEK293 and 1  105
PA-1, NCCIT, NTera-2, or Tera-2 cells were plated per well of a 12-well dish
(Nunc) 24 h before transfections. Cells were transfected with 0.375 Ag of
TOPglow (Upstate), 0.10 Ag of LEF1, and 0.01 Ag of SV40 RL with Fugene
(Roche). After 24 h, the medium was changed and cells were left untreated
or treated with purified wnt3a at 100 to 300 ng/mL, with the indicated
proteins at 2.5 to 5 Ag/mL, or with a 1:100 dilution of serum samples for an
additional 20 to 24 h before harvesting. Cells were harvested in 50 to 100 AL
of lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 50 mmol/L
NaF, 1 mmol/L NaVO4, and protease inhibitors] and 10 AL samples were
assayed in duplicate using Dual-Glo Luciferase assay (Promega) and
detected in an Envision Luminometer (Perkin-Elmer). Luciferase activity
was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity.
Animals. Female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice 6 to 8 weeks old (Charles
River Laboratories) were used for pharmacodynamic and in vivo efficacy
studies, whereas female C57Bl6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used
for the passaging of MMTV-Wnt1 tumors. Maintenance of mice and in vivo
procedures were carried out using Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee–approved protocols.
Determination of in vivo stability and pharmacodynamics. Four
groups of female athymic nude mice (12 animals/group) were given
F8CRDhFc as follows: (a) F8CRDhFc 1 mg/kg i.v., (b) F8CRDhFc 5 mg/kg i.v.,
(c) F8CRDhFc 20 mg/kg i.v., (d) F8CRDhFc 20 mg/kg i.p. At various time
points, 125 AL of blood was collected from three different animals by
retroorbital bleed and the concentration of F8CRDhFc in serum was
determined by ELISA. Three hundred and eighty-four–well plates (Nunc

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

Maxisorp) were coated overnight with 1 Ag/mL of rabbit anti-human IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS. The plates were blocked with PBS
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10 ppm proclin and washed
with assay/wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and 10 ppm proclin). The
F8CRDhFc standards and the diluted serum samples were incubated for
2 h at room temperature and bound F8CRDhFc was detected using
horseradish peroxidase goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
and the HRP substrate TMB (Moss, Inc.). Concentrations of F8CRDhFc in
serum samples were determined using a standard curve fit to a fourparameter algorithm.
For immunoblot detection of Fc-tagged proteins in serum, 1 AL of serum
was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, detected with anti-human IRconjugated antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals), and scanned on the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor).
Passaging of MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic tumors in mice. The tumors
from MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice were serially passaged in C57Bl6 mice
for 6 to 10 passages by surgical implantation in the mammary fat pad.
Tumor tissue was aseptically collected from the transgenic mouse, rinsed
in HBSS and cut into small pieces. The recipient mice were anaesthetized
with a mixture of ketamine (75–80 mg/kg) and xylazine (7.5–15 mg/kg),
the tumor fragment inserted under the skin rostral to the third mammary
fat pad, and the skin closed using wound clips. Tumors were passaged
for a maximum of 10 passages, and after the first two passages, tumor
tissue was examined histologically to confirm that it was of mammary
origin.
In vivo efficacy studies. For in vivo efficacy studies in the MMTV-Wnt1
tumor model, tissue from serially passaged MMTV-Wnt1 tumors was
macerated in HBSS and the cells obtained were used for allografts. For
in vivo studies using the NTera-2 or PA-1 model systems, either 8 million
NTera-2 cells per mouse or 10 million PA-1 cells per mouse were
inoculated. All cells were suspended in a 50% Matrigel solution in HBSS
and a volume of 0.2 mL was injected s.c. into the right dorsal flank of
athymic nude mice.
After 5 to 12 days of cell inoculation, tumor measurements and grouping
of mice was done as previously described (32). Treatments were started 1 to
2 days after grouping and therapeutic agents were dosed by either i.p. or i.v.
route with 100 to 200 AL of protein or vehicle (PBS). For all studies, the mice
were treated with a single loading dose of 15 mg/kg, followed by subsequent
doses at 10 mg/kg. Frequency and length of treatments are indicated for
each study. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly and animals were
sacrificed when tumor volume reached 2,500 mm3 or when tumors showed
signs of impending ulceration. Data collected from each experimental group
were expressed as mean F SEM and the statistical significance of efficacy
was assessed by Student’s t tests (two-tailed distribution, two-sample
unequal variance).
Preparation and analysis of RNA from cell lines and tumor tissue.
For microarray analysis, cells were treated with the indicated proteins in
triplicate and total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Array
analysis was done on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Gene Chip set as
previously described (32).
Tumor tissue RNA was purified from xenograft specimens collected at
the end of the efficacy study and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis of wnt-responsive transcripts carried out as previously
described (32). Fold induction for each gene was determined using the
DDCt method and the result presented relative to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase. The specific probes and primer sets are listed
in Supplementary Table S1. All reactions were done in duplicate and the
average of at least two assays F SEM was plotted.
Histology and immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissues. Immunohistochemistry for h-catenin was done on
tumor xenograft tissue, skin and intestine harvested at the termination of
efficacy studies. Tissues were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and serial
sections were subjected to antigen retrieval (Dako Target Retrieval),
following which h-catenin was detected with a monoclonal antibody (clone
14; BD PharMingen) as previously described (33). The sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Lab) and mounted using
Histomount (Zymed).

Antitumor Efficacy of Frizzled8CRD-hFc

Results
Activity, stability, and pharmacokinetics of F8CRDhFc.
Purified Fzd8(1–173)hFc was previously shown to effectively inhibit
wnt signaling in vitro (34, 35). Prior to testing the antitumor
efficacy of Fzd8(1–173)hFc, we determined the half-life of this
protein and found that it was rapidly cleared in vivo. Using data
from the crystal structure of the mouse Fzd8 domain (36), we
generated a minimal Fzd8 construct in which potential protease
cleavage sites were deleted (Fig. 1A). This protein, denoted as
F8CRDhFc, consists of residues 1–155 of the Fzd8 receptor fused to
the hFc domain. Using BIAcore analysis, we determined that
F8CRDhFc directly binds wnt3a purified from L cells (Fig. 1B), but
not wnt3a purified from E. coli (data not shown), which is inactive
due to the lack of lipid modification (30). Kinetic binding data for
this interaction could not be approximated using simple binding
models, possibly due to the dimeric nature of F8CRDhFc (data not
shown). F8CRDhFc also inhibited TOPflash reporter signaling in
wnt3a-stimulated U2OS cells in a dose-dependent manner with an
apparent IC50 of 1 to 2 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting
that the molecule was active at low concentrations.

The stability of F8CRDhFc protein in vivo was determined by
assaying both protein levels and activity in serum collected at various
time points from animals injected i.v. with 10 mg/kg of protein. Using
Western blot analysis, F8CRDhFc was detectable in serum 72 h after
administration, whereas Fzd8(1–173)hFc was not detectable beyond
30 min (Fig. 1C, inset). The activity of F8CRDhFc in the collected
serum was assayed by measuring the inhibition of wnt3a-dependent
TOPglow reporter activity in HEK293 cells. Although comparable
in vitro potency was observed on treatment with purified Fzd8(1–
173)hFc and F8CRDhFc at 2.5 Ag/mL, only partial inhibitory activity
was recovered from the serum of Fzd8(1–173)hFc-treated mice
collected 30 min after protein administration. In contrast, more potent
inhibitory activity could be recovered from the serum of F8CRDhFctreated mice for up to 24 h after administration (Fig. 1C). Therefore,
F8CRDhFc protein was used for all subsequent studies.
We tested the in vivo pharmacokinetics of F8CRDhFc by
administration of a single dose of protein at 1, 5, or 20 mg/kg i.v.
or at 20 mg/kg i.p. Following both i.v. and i.p. administration,
F8CRDhFc displayed a dose-proportional increase in exposure with
biphasic elimination at all doses (Fig. 1D). When dosed at 20 mg/kg

were removed to produce F8CRDhFc. B, BIAcore sensogram generated by binding purified soluble wnt3a to immobilized F8CRDhFc. The traces represent two

collected at the indicated time points was analyzed for total and active protein. Immunoblotting for human Fc (top ) was used to detect the protein present in 1 AL
of serum and compared with 25 Ag of the respective purified protein (P). Wnt inhibitory activity was assayed by measuring TOPglow activity in wnt3a-stimulated HEK293
cells treated with serum of injected animals (bottom right ). Antagonist activity of purified Fzd8(1–173)hFc and F8CRDhFc in HEK293 cells is also shown (bottom left ).

F8CRDhFc following administration of a single dose of protein. Mice were dosed at either 1, 5, or 20 mg/kg i.v. or 20 mg/kg i.p. and serum samples were taken from

Figure 2. In vivo efficacy of F8CRDhFc against MMTV-Wnt1 tumor allografts. Mice bearing established MMTV-Wnt1 tumor transplants were given PBS, CD4hFc
(10 mg/kg/d), or F8CRDhFc (10 mg/kg/d) by i.p. injection twice weekly (A ) or by i.v. injection thrice weekly (B ). An independent group of mice bearing larger tumors
(LgT ), with a mean tumor volume of 375 mm3, was also treated in the i.v. experiment. Points, mean tumor volume plotted over time; bars, SEM; arrows, treatment
days (X-axis ); hatch marks, sacrificed animals; asterisks, statistical significance.

by either the i.p. or i.v. route, comparable serum levels of protein
were achieved within a day of injection and the protein was detectable in serum up to 7 days. After i.p. dosing at 20 mg/kg, protein was
rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of f8 h and bioavailability (AUCIP/
AUCIV) of 92%. The clearance of the protein was f25 to 30 mL/d/kg
with a half-life of about 4 days (Supplementary Table S2).
F8CRDhFc inhibits growth of MMTV-Wnt1 tumor allografts.
The antitumor efficacy of F8CRDhFc was tested in vivo using a
model derived from mammary tumors originating in MMTV-Wnt1
transgenic mice (6). Cells isolated from MMTV-Wnt1 tumors were
injected into athymic nude mice and, after 12 days, the mice were
grouped into seven study groups. Three groups (n = 11) with a
mean tumor volume of 226 mm3 were treated twice weekly with i.p.
injections of PBS, F8CRDhFc, or CD4hFc, and three additional
groups were treated with the same agents thrice a week by i.v.
administration. An additional study group (n = 10), in which the
tumors were allowed to reach a larger mean tumor volume of
375 mm3, was treated with F8CRDhFc i.v. Administration of
F8CRDhFc by i.p. or i.v. route resulted in rapid tumor regression
with sustained inhibition during the course of treatment, whereas
the negative control protein CD4hFc had no effect relative to the
PBS treatment (Fig. 2A and B). The F8CRDhFc-treated mice were
followed for 3 weeks after termination of treatments and regrowth
of tumors was eventually observed (Fig. 2A and B).
F8CRDhFc inhibits the growth of human teratoma xenografts. Although inhibition of MMTV-Wnt1 tumor growth shows
the pharmacologic activity of F8CRDhFc, inhibition of naturally
derived human tumor models would strengthen its potential as a
human cancer therapeutic. To identify a relevant model, we tested
human tumor–derived cell lines for evidence of autocrine wnt
signaling, similar to that seen in the PA-1 teratoma cell line (14).
The teratoma-derived NTera-2, Tera-2, and NCCIT cell lines
exhibited basal wnt signaling that could be inhibited by F8CRDhFc,
contrary to 293 cells that exhibited low basal signaling that was not
inhibited by F8CRDhFc (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, all four teratoma
cell lines seemed to express wnt receptors, as signaling was further
stimulated by wnt3a treatment, which could be blocked by

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

F8CRDhFc (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the teratoma cell
lines express wnt(s), which might contribute to their tumorigenicity. We therefore evaluated these lines for tumor formation in
athymic nude mice and based on consistency of tumor formation,
we selected NTera-2 and PA-1 for in vivo efficacy studies.
Six days after inoculation with NTera-2 cells, mice were divided
into four treatment groups and treated thrice a week by i.p.
administration. Three groups (n = 20), each with a mean tumor
volume of 202 mm3 were treated with PBS, CD4hFc, or F8CRDhFc,
whereas a fourth group (n = 10) with a mean tumor volume of
336 mm3, was treated with F8CRDhFc. Relative to controls,
treatment with F8CRDhFc reduced tumor volume and mass by
f50% and 70%, respectively (Fig. 3C). We next tested the PA-1
tumor model under similar conditions using three groups of mice
(n = 13) harboring tumors with a mean initial volume of 168 mm3.
Again, treatment with F8CRDhFc showed a significant reduction in
tumor growth within 12 days of treatment (Fig. 3D). In this model,
the tumors were f50% smaller, with significantly smaller mass
than those in control groups at the end of the treatment period
(Fig. 3D, inset).
Wnt target genes as pharmacodynamic markers of drug
response. To show that the in vivo efficacy observed with
F8CRDhFc treatment correlated with inhibition of wnt signaling,
we did immunohistochemical analyses for h-catenin localization in
tumors of mice treated with F8CRDhFc. Tumors derived from
NTera-2, PA-1, NCCIT, and Tera-2 cell lines had varying levels of
cytosolic h-catenin with no remarkable nuclear localization
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, the h-catenin localization
pattern was not detectably altered following treatment with
F8CRDhFc for 5 or 48 h in MMTV-Wnt1 tumors (data not shown)
and NTera-2 tumors (Fig. 4). The small intestine was included as
a positive control and nuclear h-catenin was readily detected in
the Paneth cells at the base of the crypts. The apparent lack
of sensitivity afforded by immunohistochemical analysis of
the teratomas prompted us to seek alternative measures for
monitoring wnt responsiveness. Although numerous target genes
of the wnt pathway have been reported, we did gene expression

Antitumor Efficacy of Frizzled8CRD-hFc

analysis on in vitro–treated cells to identify those genes most
appropriate for the teratoma cells employed in our study. We
initially did comparative gene expression analysis on PA-1 cells
treated with purified wnt3a, F8CRDhFc, or a control protein. The
expression levels of previously identified targets of wnt signaling
such as Axin2 (37), APCDD1 (38), and Gad1 (39) were up-regulated
by wnt3a treatment or down-regulated by F8CRDhFc treatment
(Fig. 5A). Moreover, some genes such as Lefty2 (A), Lefty1 (B),
sFRP1, and Fzd5 were down-regulated by wnt3a and up-regulated
by inhibition of wnt signaling with F8CRDhFc (Fig. 5A). Subsequent
gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR showed that these transcripts
were similarly regulated by wnt3a and F8CRDhFc in NTera-2,
Tera-2, and NCCIT cells as well (data not shown).
APCDD1, Gad1, and Fzd5 were among the most consistently
modulated genes in our in vitro analyses and were therefore
selected as potential markers of wnt responsiveness for the in vivo
tumor xenograft studies. Similar to the effects seen in vitro,
treatment with therapeutic doses of F8CRDhFc reduced the

expression of genes for APCDD1 and Gad1 and increased the
expression of Fzd5 in tumors from the NTera-2 xenografts (Fig. 5B).
Although there is a general nonspecific down-regulation of all
genes following CD4hFc treatment, these changes were not
statistically significant compared with those seen in F8CRDhFctreated tumors. These observations show that the antitumorigenic
effects of F8CRDhFc in vivo are on target and that the expression
levels of these genes can be used to monitor the efficacy of
potential anti-wnt therapeutic agents.
Therapeutic administration of F8CRDhFc has no adverse
effects on regenerating tissue. Wnt signaling plays a critical role
in self-renewal of regenerating tissue such as skin, intestine, and
hematopoietic cells (4), and inhibition of wnt signaling by Dkk1
can adversely affect the architecture of these tissues in adult mice
(35, 40, 41). We therefore determined whether exposure to
F8CRDhFc under the same conditions used to obtain antitumor
efficacy had any effect on intestine and skin in the mice. Tissues
were collected from mice that were treated in the MMTV-Wnt1

transfected with the TOPglow plasmid and treated with F8CRDhFc or CD4hFc, in the absence (A) or presence (B ) of exogenously added wnt3a protein. For each cell
line, activity was expressed relative to that observed in the absence of any treatment (NA ); representative of at least two independent experiments. Mice bearing
established NTera-2 (C ) or PA-1 (D ) tumors were given PBS, CD4hFc (10 mg/kg), or F8CRDhFc (10 mg/kg) by i.p. injection thrice a week. For the NTera-2 tumor
study, an independent group of 10 mice with larger tumors (LgT ) having a mean tumor volume of 336 mm3 was also tested. Points, mean tumor volume plotted
over time; bars, SEM; arrows, treatment days (X-axis ); asterisks, statistical significance. Columns, mean tumor weight for each group, determined upon termination of

nuclear h-catenin staining in intestinal Paneth cells (Fig. 6A) and
skin hair follicles (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis of skin and intestine collected from animals
using the NTera-2 model, after nine treatments, thrice a week
also revealed no differences between control and treated groups
(data not shown). This suggests that treatment with F8CRDhFc
with the therapeutic regimen that can inhibit tumor growth does
not have adverse effects on tissue renewal of skin and intestine.

Discussion
The evidence for dysregulated wnt signaling in cancer is readily
apparent from genetic defects identified in pathway components.
It is therefore reasonable to presume that epigenetic mechanisms
resulting in hyperactive wnt signaling might also contribute to
human cancer progression. Numerous studies have associated the
overexpression of wnt ligands and their receptors, or downregulation of wnt antagonists such as sFRP, Dkk1, and WIF-1, with
the occurrence of cancer. Based on these observations, it has been
suggested that molecules which interfere with wnt ligand/receptor
interactions might be useful as therapeutic agents in these cancers.
Several approaches such as the use of monoclonal antibodies
against wnt ligands (24, 25) and overexpression of wnt antagonists
in tumor cells (14, 26, 27) have shown that inhibition of wnt
signaling can reduce in vivo tumor growth.
We have generated a novel form of a soluble wnt receptor,
F8CRDhFc, which exhibits favorable pharmacologic behavior in vivo.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

Using the MMTV-Wnt1 tumor model, we showed that F8CRDhFc
treatment results in the regression of established wnt1-driven
tumors, clearly showing the in vivo potency of the F8CRDhFc-soluble
receptor. The tumor inhibition was reversible in this model as
regrowth was observed after F8CRDhFc dosing was discontinued.
This is consistent with studies in which mammary tumor growth and
regression correlated with the expression status of the conditional
wnt1 transgene (9). To validate the utility of F8CRDhFc in human
cancers, we identified tumorigenic cell lines that exhibited
endogenous wnt ligand–driven signaling. Some human germ cell
tumors (42) and cell lines derived from these tumors have increased
basal wnt signaling (14) and show a canonical response to
stimulation and inhibition of wnt signaling (14, 43). We screened
the teratoma cell lines NTera-2, Tera-2, and NCCIT for increased
basal wnt signaling activity and showed that, similar to PA-1 cells
(14), treatment with F8CRDhFc could inhibit this activity in vitro.
Nevertheless, it was not clear that this wnt activity contributed to the
tumorigenic potential of these cancer cell lines. Using model systems
with xenograft tumors derived from NTera-2 and PA-1 cells, we have
shown that administration of therapeutic doses of F8CRDhFc results
in a significant suppression of these tumors as well. A molecular
diagnostic marker for wnt signaling will be essential to identify
human cancers that are amenable to treatment with F8CRDhFc.
Although the cell lines screened have up-regulated wnt signaling,
immunohistochemical analysis of h-catenin localization in the
corresponding tumors was not a reliable indicator of this activity
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This could be a distinction between cells
that have autocrine wnt signaling compared with cells harboring
APC or h-catenin mutations. Accordingly, it has been shown that
increased nuclear h-catenin in ovarian carcinoma is specifically
associated with h-catenin mutations (44). Immunohistochemical

analysis of xenograft tissue from F8CRDhFc-treated mice in the
MMTV-Wnt1 and NTera-2 tumors did not show differences in the
levels or cellular localization of h-catenin, suggesting that changes in
h-catenin may be too small to detect. Similarly, expression of the
CRD of Fzd7 did not affect h-catenin levels or localization, although
tumor growth was reduced (26).
As an alternative to immunohistochemical analysis of h-catenin,
we identified transcriptional targets of wnt to monitor signaling
activity and drug response. The cell lines that had autocrine wnt
signaling showed increased expression of known wnt target genes
and this expression was regulated by in vitro treatment with wnt3a

as well as by F8CRDhFc. Although tumors derived from NTera-2
cells did not show any changes in h-catenin on F8CRDhFc
treatment, RNA analysis of these samples revealed that F8CRDhFc
treatment does affect expression of the wnt target genes tested.
Thus, the expression of these genes can be followed as an indicator
of treatment efficacy. As an extension of these observations,
expression of these wnt target genes can be used as a diagnostic
tool to identify cancers that are driven by wnt signaling and are
therefore candidates for anti-wnt therapeutic agents.
Several studies suggest that inhibition of wnt signaling could
adversely affect the architecture of the skin (45) and intestine

(40, 41). This is presumably linked to an important role for wnt in
the maintenance of stem cells that play a critical role in the
regeneration of these tissue compartments. In our studies, mice
treated with F8CRDhFc seemed healthy and showed no dramatic
weight loss, suggesting that the molecule had limited overall
toxicity. Histologic analysis showed that skin and intestine of
F8CRDhFc-treated mice were normal, with typical patterns of
cytoplasmic and nuclear h-catenin staining in intestinal Paneth
cells and skin hair follicles. The published reports showing the
adverse effects of inhibiting wnt signaling in the intestine used
either adenoviral-mediated expression (40) or tissue-specific
transgenic expression (41) of Dkk1. It is possible that the local or
high-level expression of wnt antagonist achieved in these studies
greatly exceeded the therapeutic dose of inhibitor administered in
our studies. Alternately, both Dkk1 and F8CRDhFc inhibit wnt
signaling by distinct mechanisms and they may have different
effects on intestine in vivo.
Our choice of teratomas for testing the therapeutic effect of
F8CRDhFc was based on the presence of autocrine wnt signal
detected in these cells when cultured in vitro. However, cancer cell
lines lacking this property might nevertheless express wnts when
grown in vivo or respond to wnt ligands supplied by host stromal
cells and thereby respond to inhibition by F8CRDhFc. A broader
understanding of which human cancers are amenable to treatment
with F8CRDhFc will be required to determine the overall breadth of
its utility in this disease. Human breast cancers represent an
attractive candidate for F8CRDhFc therapy, as there is substantial
evidence for abnormal wnt signaling, yet mutations in wnt pathway
components are rare (46). It also remains possible that cancers
containing mutations in downstream wnt pathway genes still rely
on wnt ligands for tumorigenicity, and consistent with this,
epigenetic silencing of genes coding for the sFRPs has been

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

observed in colorectal cancer (20). Although we have found no
effect of purified F8CRDhFc, sFRP1, or Dkk1 on wnt signaling
in vitro in colorectal cancer cells containing pathway mutations
(data not shown), wnt ligands might contribute to their tumorigenicity in a manner not measurable with synthetic wnt reporter
plasmids. For example, wnt ligands can activate the growth control
pathways mediated by mTOR-S6 kinase (47), Akt (48), and ERK (49)
through h-catenin–independent mechanisms.
In conclusion, we have used both an engineered tumor model as
well as naturally occurring models with autocrine wnt signaling to
show that wnt signaling can be modulated in a pharmacologically
relevant manner in vivo by F8CRDhFc. Although the wnt pathway
has been implicated in many cancers, it is not clear which of the 21
known wnt ligands play a role in human cancer. The Fzd CRD
domains identified thus far share significant sequence similarity
and proposed structure (50), strongly suggesting that most of these
domains may share a common biological function in binding wnt
ligands. The F8CRDhFc molecule described here is predicted to
bind to and inhibit the activity of multiple wnt ligands and may
therefore be efficacious in inhibiting the growth of tumors driven
by multiple wnt or Fzd homologues.
