Summary

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Mitochondria are involved in a variety of cellular functions including ATP production, amino acid
and lipid biogenesis and breakdown, signaling and apoptosis1-3. Mitochondrial dysfunction has
been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and aging4. Although transcriptional
mechanisms regulating mitochondrial abundance are known5, comparatively little is known about
how mitochondrial function is regulated. We identify here the metabolite stearic acid (C18:0) and
Transferrin Receptor (TfR1) as mitochondrial regulators. We elucidate a signaling pathway
whereby C18:0 stearoylates TfR1, thereby inhibiting its activation of JNK signaling. This leads to
reduced ubiquitination of mitofusin via HUWE1, thereby promoting mitochondrial fusion and
function. We find that animal cells are poised to respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0
levels, with increased C18:0 dietary intake boosting mitochondrial fusion in vivo. Intriguingly,
dietary C18:0 supplementation can counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by genetic
defects such as loss of the Parkinsons genes Pink or Parkin. This work identifies the metabolite
C18:0 as a signaling molecule regulating mitochondrial function in response to diet.

as fly Elovl6 (“dElovl6”). On standard laboratory food, dElovl6 loss-of-function animals
(l(3)02281−/−, “dElovl6−”) die as early larvae8 (Fig. 1a). We confirmed dElovl6− mutants
have impaired C16:0⦿C18:0 elongase activity and reduced C18:0 levels (Extended Data
Fig. 1a-b), and their lethality is rescued by human Elovl6 (ED Fig. 1c-d). Survival to
pupation was rescued by supplementing fly food (containing little lipid), with C18:0 (Fig.
1a), but not C18:1 or C20:0 (ED Fig. 1e), confirming the larval lethality is due to C18:0
deficit.
We serendipitously discovered that removing antifungal agents from fly food improved
Elovl6− survival (Fig. 1a). Since these agents are mitotoxins, this suggested Elovl6− mutants
might be hypersensitive to mitochondrial inhibition. Indeed, sub-lethal concentrations of
Rotenone, a Complex I inhibitor, killed Elovl6− mutants when added to antifungal-free food
(Fig. 1b), but other drugs did not (ED Fig. 1f). Thus mitochondrial function is limiting in
Elovl6− mutants. Elovl6− mutants have impaired mitochondrial respiration, rescued by
dietary C18:0 supplementation (Fig. 1c-c’) or by expressing an alternative oxidase AOX9
allowing bypass of Complexes III+IV (Fig. 1d). Complex IV activity was not impaired in
Elovl6− mutants (ED Fig. 1g), suggesting Elovl6− mutants suffer from a Complex III defect.
If the main cause of Elovl6− lethality is reduced mitochondrial function, then viability
should be rescued by restoring mitochondrial functional capacity. Indeed, Elovl6− viability
was rescued by expressing AOX or PGC1a, driving mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1e-f and
ED Fig. 1h-i). Thus the organismal function of C18:0 is less pleiotropic than expected.
Interestingly, Drosophila Elovl6 localizes to mitochondrial outer membranes (Fig. 1g, ED
Fig. 1j).

Lipidomic analysis of purified mitochondria (ED Fig. 5b) revealed their membranes have
little C18:0 (ED Fig. 2a), suggesting C18:0 does not play a structural role in mitochondria.
Elovl6− mutants also did not have fewer mitochondria than controls (assayed by porin levels
and citrate synthase activity, ED Figs. 2b-c). We therefore investigated if C18:0 regulates
mitochondrial activity. Mitochondria dynamically fuse and fission to form tubular
structures10,11. Elovl6− mutants had hyper-fragmented mitochondria, rescued by dietary
C18:0 supplementation (Fig. 2a-a’, ED Fig. 2d). dElovl6 knockdown in S2 cells reproduced
this phenotype (Fig. 2b-b’), indicating it is cell autonomous. Importantly, we grow S2 cells
in Serum Free Medium, which lacks fatty acids normally bound to serum BSA.
Mitochondria of dElovl6 knockdown cells rapidly re-fused upon addition of BSAconjugated C18:0 to the medium for just 120 (Fig. 2b-b’) or 20 minutes (not shown).
Mitochondria of HeLa cells also fragmented when grown in medium with serum that was
delipidated by organic extraction (Fig. 2c-c’). This was rescued by re-adding BSAconjugated C18:0 for 2 hours (Fig. 2c-c’), but not other fatty acids (ED Fig. 2e-e’). One lipid
specific to mitochondria is lipoic acid (LA). Knockdown of LA Synthase, led to reduced LA
levels but not mitochondrial fragmentation (ED Fig. 2f-f”), and depletion of C18:0 did not
affect levels of LA or lipoylated proteins (ED Figs. 2g-h) indicating the effects of C18:0 are
independent of LA. Thus C18:0 regulates mitochondrial morphology in fly and human cells.
Mitochondrial fragmentation is due to either hyperactive fission or impaired fusion.
Blocking fission with mdivi-1, a Drp1 inhibitor12, induced mitochondrial fusion in control

cells, but not in HeLas cultured without C18:0 (Fig. 2d-d’), indicating impaired
mitochondrial fusion in this condition. Mitochondria labeled with photoactivatable
mitoGFP13 (green) rapidly fused with the rest of the network (mitotracker red) in control
cells, but not in cells cultured without C18:0, demonstrating impaired fusion (Fig. 2e-e’).

Mitochondrial fusion is regulated largely via mitofusins (Mfn)14,15. Epistasis experiments
indicated C18:0 acts upstream of mitofusin to regulate mitochondrial morphology:
Expression of dMfn/Marf rescued mitochondrial fragmentation in dElovl6 knockdown cells
(Fig. 3a), indicating dMfn acts downstream of C18:0. C18:0 did not induce fusion in the
absence of dMfn (Fig. 3b), indicating C18:0 requires dMfn for its action. Likewise,
expression of dMfn rescued dElovl6− larval lethality (Fig. 3c). To test if C18:0 can rescue
dMfn loss-of-function we generated dMfn knockout flies. These flies phenocopy Elovl6−
mutants: they have fragmented mitochondria, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and die as
early-stage larvae that do not grow (ED Fig. 3a-d). Dietary supplementation with C18:0 had
no effect on growth or viability of dMfn knockouts (Fig. 3d).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We asked if C18:0 affects Mfn via post-translational modifications (PTMs). Mfn from
dElovl6− mutant larvae, or from HeLas growing with delipidated serum, migrated
differently in SDS-PAGE compared to control conditions (ED Fig. 3e-f).
Immunoprecipitating Mfn2 from HeLa +/−C18:0 and probing with antibodies detecting
various PTMs revealed that Mfn2 from cells without C18:0 is hyper-ubiquitinated
(endogenous proteins Fig. 3e lanes 1, 3, 5 and tagged proteins ED Fig. 3g). Several ubiquitin
ligases target Mfn216-18. Only knockdown of HUWE1 rescued the mitochondrial
fragmentation (Fig. 3f-f’, ED Fig. 4a-c) and Mfn2 hyper-ubiquitination (Fig. 3e lanes 3 vs 4)
caused by C18:0 removal, as well as lethality of Elovl6 mutant flies (ED Fig. 4d),
identifying HUWE1 as the C18:0-responsive ubiquitin ligase. As expected19, increased
Mfn2 ubiquitination caused Mfn2 protein destabilization (ED Fig 3h-h’). C18:0 removal did
not dramatically drop Mfn2 steady-state levels, partly due to compensatory increases in
Mfn2 expression (ED Fig. 3i), suggesting ubiquitination additionally blocks Mfn2 function
in a degradation-independent manner, as for other HUWE1 targets20. HUWE1 only
ubiquitinates Mfn2 phosphorylated on Ser27 by JNK19. Inhibition of JNK prevented
mitochondrial fragmentation upon C18:0 removal (Fig. 3g-g’). In sum, C18:0 regulates Mfn
ubiquitination via HUWE1, and thereby mitochondrial morphology and function. Elovl6−
mutant flies display other dMfn loss-of-function phenotypes, such as reduced ER-tomitochondrial connections and abnormal cristae21,22 (ED Fig. 5).
We asked how C18:0 affects JNK or HUWE1 activity. ER stress can activate JNK. However
C18:0 removal did not lead to a UPR response (ED Fig. 6a-b) and neither knockdown of
UPR effectors nor treatment with TUDCA, an ER chaperone that inhibits ER stress23,
blunted mitochondrial fragmentation upon C18:0 removal (ED Fig. 6c-d’). Instead, we
hypothesized C18:0 might regulate proteins via covalent binding (“stearoylation”),
analogous to protein palmitoylation. We synthesized C18:0 derivatives with azide or alkyne
functionalities, allowing covalent coupling to beads via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne
cycloaddition (“click chemistry”) (ED Fig. 7b). We tested multiple derivatives, and only
C17:0-azide induced mitochondrial fusion like C18:0 (ED Fig. 7a). We treated HeLas with
C17:0-azide for 2 hours, lysed them in 8M urea to denature proteins, precipitated the lipid

by coupling to beads, and identified covalently bound proteins by mass spectrometry. The
most abundant protein in the lipid pulldown was Transferrin Receptor (TfR1) (ED Fig. 7b’),
confirmed by immunoblotting (ED Fig. 7c lanes 1-3). Binding of TfR1 to C17:0-azide was
abolished by treating lysates with hydroxylamine pH7.5, indicating a thioester linkage (not
shown). We tested the top 10 putatively stearoylated protein complexes for effects on
mitochondrial morphology by knockdown. Knockdown of TfR1 completely blunted
mitochondrial fragmentation upon C18:0 removal (Fig. 3h and ED Fig. 7b’,d). Thus TfR1 is
required for cells to sense the absence of C18:0.
Since TfR1 is important for cellular iron uptake, TfR1 stearoylation could affect
mitochondria via iron uptake or delivery. However, cells grow for days in medium lacking
C18:0 but die in medium lacking iron (ED Fig. 8a-a’), suggesting iron uptake is not
significantly impaired in the absence of C18:0. Indeed, cells in medium lacking C18:0 do
not show an iron deficiency transcriptional response (ED Fig. 8b), nor a drop in protein or
activity levels of enzymes containing iron-sulfur clusters (ED Fig. 8c-f”), nor impaired
transferrin uptake (ED Fig. 8g-g’) nor reduced association of transferrin with mitochondria
(ED Fig. 8h), suggesting the effects of C18:0 are independent of iron. TfR1 also has a
signaling function, activating JNK in response to the ligand gambogic acid (GA)24. Low
concentrations of GA which do not induce apoptosis (ED Fig. 9a) induced rapid
mitochondrial fragmentation in HeLas (2 hours, Fig. 3i). This was suppressed by adding
C18:0 (Fig. 3i and ED Fig. 9b), indicating C18:0 blocks this signaling function of TfR1.
Indeed, treatment of HeLas with C18:0 reduced JNK activation, using Jun kinase
phosphorylation and phospho-JNK nuclear translocation as readouts (ED Fig. 9c-d). JNK
inhibition blocked the ability of GA to induce mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 3j and ED
Fig. 9e). In sum, these data suggest TfR1 induces mitochondrial fragmentation via JNK, and
this is inhibited by TfR1 stearoylation (Fig. 3k).

Palmitoyl-transferases covalently bind C16:0 before transferring it to substrates. We found
one member of this family, ZDHHC6, in our C17:0-azide pulldowns, suggesting it is a
C18:0 transferase. Indeed, knockdown of ZDHHC6 blunted TfR1 stearoylation (ED Fig. 7c,
lane 5). Further work is required to study this in detail.
We noticed that elevating C18:0 levels in control cells increases mitochondrial fusion (Fig.
2b-b’). Supplementing the diet of wildtype flies with C18:0 also increased mitochondrial
fusion, whereas starvation of larvae led to mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 4). Thus fly
cells respond to both increases and decreases in levels of C18:0.
We asked if dietary C18:0 supplementation improves mitochondrial function in pathological
conditions. Flies mutant for Pink or Parkin are established Parkinsons models. They have
impaired mitochondrial function, and recapitulate Parkinsons phenotypes (reduced lifespan,
neurodegeneration, and impaired motor control25-29). Dietary supplementation with C18:0
rescued the longevity, ATP levels, and climbing defects of Pink− flies and the longevity of
Parkin− flies (Fig. 4, ED Fig. 10, other Parkin phenotypes not tested).
We identify C18:0 as a regulator of mitochondrial function. Upon loss of C18:0, TfR1 destearoylation activates JNK, leading to HUWE1-dependent Mfn ubiquitination, impaired

Mfn activity19, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Loss of C18:0 in flies specifically impacts
mitochondrial function, since Elovl6− lethality can be rescued by PGC1a, AOX, or mitofusin
expression or HUWE1 knockdown. To our knowledge, this is the first time stearoylation of a
human protein regulates its function. The link of TfR1 to mitochondria perhaps makes sense
since iron enters cells via TfR1 and then mainly travels to mitochondria for iron-sulfur
clusters. Flies are sensitive to dietary C18:0; increased dietary C18:0 leads to increased
mitochondrial fusion in vivo. Thus the metabolite C18:0 acts as a signaling molecule linking
diet to mitochondrial function. Intriguingly, dietary C18:0 can improve mitochondrial
function also in some pathological conditions in the fly, since dietary supplementation with
C18:0 improved the Parkinsons-related phenotypes observed in Pink and Parkin mutant
flies. See Supplementary Discussion.

mutant larvae have reduced levels of C18:0, the product of Elovl6 elongase activity. Values
are the averages of technical duplicates on biological duplicates. Error bars represent s.e.m.
(c) Lethality of dElovl6 mutants is fully rescued to expected mendelian ratios by ubiquitous
expression (with actin-GAL4) of dElovl6 from a UAS transgene (Chi square test
1.149<3.841=χ2 where p=0.05, n=141, **** p<0.0001).
(d) Human Elovl6 and Drosophila Elovl6 are functionally equivalent, since the lethality of
dElovl6 mutant flies is fully rescued to expected mendelian ratios by ubiquitous expression
(with actin-GAL4) of human Elovl6 from a UAS transgene (Chi square test 2.38<3.841=χ2
where p=0.05, n = 76, ** p<0.01)
(e) The lethality of dElovl6 mutant flies is most strongly rescued by C18:0, the product of
Elovl6. Synchronized 1st instar larvae of indicated genotypes were grown on standard food
supplemented with indicated fatty acids (5%). The percentage of total animals surviving to
pupation was calculated. Values represent average of biological triplicates.
(f) dElovl6 mutants are not hypersensitivite to drugs such as G418 (protein biosynthesis
inhibitor) or etoposide (topoisomerase inhibitor). 30 synchronized L1 larvae were grown in
vials with food supplemented with either G418 (50μg/mL) or etoposite (25μM). Percentage
of animals that reach pupation was quantified. Values represent average of 4 biological
replicates.
(g) Complex IV activity of dElovl6− larvae is not impaired. Complex IV activity of female
prewandering larvae was measured with Oroboros High Resolution Respirometry. Oxygen
consumption was measured in the presence of only TMPD as substrate, which can be
directly oxidized by complex IV. The values were corrected for non-mitochondrial oxygen
consumption (oxygen consumption in the presence of complex IV inhibitor KCN) and
normalized to tissue weight. (n=3)
(h, i) Overexpression of PGC1α (fly Spargel) in dElovl6 mutant female prewandering larvae
leads to increased mitochondrial abundance, assessed by porin levels (h, representative of 6

S2 cell lysates (“total”) were successively fractionated to yield crude mitochondria (which
include mitochondrial-associated membranes, MAMs), pure mitochondria (lacking MAMs),
and mitochondrial outer membranes (OM), inner membranes (IM) and inter-membrane

(d) dElovl6 mutant larvae have fragmented mitochondria, which is rescued by dietary C18:0
supplementation. Mitochondrial morphology from fat bodies of control or Elovl6 mutant
female larvae, fed control or C18:0 (10%) supplemented food, visualized with mito-GFP.
Images are representative of 8 areas of 4 larvae from each genotype and food conditions.
Equivalent pictures for body wall are shown in Main Figure 2a.
(e-e’) Only C18:0, and not shorter, longer, or desaturated fatty acids, restores mitochondrial
fragmentation to control levels in HeLa cells grown in medium containing delipidated
serum. Mitochondria were visualized with mitotracker (red) (e) and mitochondrial
fragmentation was quantified by normalizing the number of mitochondrial particles to total
mitochondrial area (e’). (n=15)
(f-f”) Reduced lipoic acid (LA) levels do not lead to mitochondrial fragmentation. Lipoic
acid synthase (LIAS) was knocked down by RNAi in HeLa cells, leading to significantly
reduced LA levels, assayed by immunoblotting of total cell lysates with antibody detecting
LA (f”). Unlike removal of C18:0, this does not lead to mitochondrial fragmentation.
Representative images in (f), quantified in (f’) (n=6). See Supplementary Information Figure
14 for image of the uncropped full western blot.
(g, h) HeLa cells growing in medium containing delipidated serum do not display reduced
levels of protein lipoylation (g) or reduced levels of lipoylated proteins (h). HeLa cells were
grown in medium containing delipidated serum for either 24 hours (the same timepoint used
for all other experiments in this manuscript where mitochondrial fragmentation is assessed)
(g-h), or for an extended period of time – 4 days (h). Lipoic acid levels were assayed by
immunobloting total cell lysates with an anti-lipoic acid antibody (g), and levels of
lipoylated proteins were assessed with specific antibodies (h). See Supplementary

(c) Homozygous mutation of dMfn is lethal. Mfn knockout larvae survive for multiple days
as small L1/L2 larvae and eventually die. Synchronised 1st instar larvae were grown on
standard fly food and examined every 24 hours for developmental stage and percent survival
(n=30).
(d) dMfn knockout animals have impaired oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption of
inverted, digitonin permeabilized, female larval tissues was measured with an Oroboros
oxygraph chamber and normalized to tissue weight. Oxygen consumption was measured in
the presence of the following substrates: GMN (glutamate and malate), GMD (glutamate,
malate and ADP), GMcD (glutamate, malate, cytochrome c and ADP), GMScD (glutamate,
malate, succinate, cytochrome c and ADP), ETS (glutamate, malate, cytochrome c, ADP and
uncoupling reagent), and Sc(Rot)u (glutamate, malate, cytochrome c, ADP and rotenone).
(n=5)
(e) Endogenous dMfn is post-translationally modified in a C18:0-dependent manner in
Drosophila. Mfn2 from dElovl6 female mutants migrates in an SDS-PAGE gel differently,
compared to Mfn2 from control animals. This is reversed by supplementing the diet with
C18:0. All indicated bands are dMfn, since they disappear in lysates from dMfn knock
animals – see Extended Data Figure 3b. Flies were grown on antifungal free food.
(f) Endogenous Mfn2 is post-translationally modified in a C18:0-dependent manner in
human HeLa cells. Mfn2 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells treated 24 hours with
medium containing standard or delipidated serum, and then 2 hours in the absence or
presence of C18:0 (100μM), lysed in 8M urea – see Methods.
(g) C18:0 affects ubiquitination of Mfn2. Mfn2 is more heavily ubiquitinated in cells treated
with delipidated serum than in control cells and this is reversed by supplementing the
medium with C18. HeLa cells were cotransfected with tagged versions of Mfn2 (myc) and
Ubiquitin (HA). Tagged Mfn2 was immunoprecipitated and blots were probed with HA
antibody to detect ubiquitination. Quantification of ubiquitination, normalized to myc-Mfn2
in the IP is shown below the lane.
(h,h’) C18:0 removal destabilizes Mfn2 protein. A cyclohexamide (CHX) chase experiment
was performed to block de novo synthesis of Mfn2, thereby looking at turnover of existing
Mfn2 protein in vivo. HeLa cells treated with medium containing delipidated serum plus/
minus C18:0 were treated with 100μM CHX and then lysed at indicated time points to
compare Mfn2 protein levels. (h’) shows densitometric quantification of the blots
normalized to loading control.

Extended Data Figure 6: C18:0 removal does not lead to ER stress, and inhibiting UPR does not
inhibit mitochondrial fragmentation upon C18:0 removal

(a) C18:0 removal for 24 hours does not induce expression of UPR target genes, quantified
by quantitative RT-PCR, normalized to hRpL19. BiP is a readout for IRE1 activation,
CHOP is a readout for ATF6 activation, and PERK is a readout of its own activation due to
a positive transcriptional feedback loop. Tunicamycin, serves as a positive control. y-axis is
displayed in logarithmic scale to fit all datapoints on one graph. The experiment was done in
triplicates.

(b) p-eIF2α, a UPR marker, does not increase upon removal of C18:0 whereas it is induced
by tunicamycin, a positive control. See Supplementary Information Figure 18 for image of

(a) C17:0-azide is a functional analog of C18:0 in that it induces mitochondrial fusion in
HeLa cells, whereas other C18:0 derivatives are not. (Cn:0-azide = HO2C(CH2)n-1N3 and
Cn:0-alkyne = HO2C(CH2)n-1CCH).
(b-b’) Transferrin receptor (TfR1) is the most enriched protein in a C17:0-azide pull-down,
and it regulates mitochondrial morphology. HeLa cells were treated with C17:0-azide for 2
hours, and covalently bound proteins were precipitated by lysing cells under denaturing
conditions (8M urea), and linking the C17:0-azide to an alkyne-labelled resin via click
chemistry (b). Precipitated proteins were identified by mass spec, and peptide counts were
normalized to peptide counts in a negative control pull-down from cells not treated with
C17:0-azide (n=3) (b’, column 2). Indicated proteins were also tested by siRNA-mediated
knockdown for effects on mitochondrial morphology (column 3).
(c) TfR1 is covalently bound to the C18:0 derivative C17:0-azide in HeLa cells in a
ZDHHC6-dependent manner. HeLas were treated with C17:0-azide for 2 hours, and
subsequently lysed in denaturing conditions (8M urea). Similar to panel (b), the C17:0-azide
was “clicked” onto a biotinylated alkyne, and the labelled proteins were pulled-down with
streptavidin beads. After washing, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted off beads in
Laemmli buffer containing biotin, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The palmitic acid
analog C15:0-azide was used as a positive control since TfR1 is known to also be
palmitoylated. C17:0-azide pulls down more TfR1 than equal amounts of C15:0-azide,
indicating that TfR1 palmitoylation cannot account for the C17:0 signal. The C17:0-azideTfR1 interaction is completely blunted upon ZDHHC6 knockdown. See Supplementary
Information Figure 18 for image of the uncropped full western blot.
(d) TfR1 is required for C18:0 removal to induce mitochondrial fragmentation. HeLa cells
were transfected with either control or TfR1 targeting siRNAs prior to treatement with
medium containing delipidated serum +/− C18:0. Representative images are shown here and
quantification of mitochondrial fragmentation is shown in the main Figure 3h. (n=15)

(a, a’) HeLa cells cannot grow in the presence of DFO, an iron chelator (a) whereas they
grow in delipidated serum lacking C18:0 at a comparable rate to cells in control medium
(a’). (n=3)
(b, b’) Treatment of HeLa cells with medium containing delipidated serum (lacking C18:0)
for 24h does not lead to transcriptional activation of iron deficiency response genes (b’),
which are activated by DFO-mediated iron chelation (24h) as a positive control (b). (n=3)

(c) Treatment of HeLa cells with medium containing delipidated serum for 24 hours or 4
days does not lead to a drop in levels of the succinate dehydrogenase protein SDHB, which
contains an Fe-S cluster. See Supplementary Information Figure 19 for image of the
uncropped full western blot.
(d-f”) Treatment of HeLa cells with medium containing delipidated serum for 24 hours or 4
days does not lead to a drop in activities of enzymes containing lipoylated subunits (PDH
and OGDH) (d-e’) or Fe-S cluster containing subunits (SDH) (f-f”). DFO treatment to
chelate iron from the medium, or siRNA-mediated depletion of the enzymes were used as
positive controls (d’, e’, f”). (n=4).
(g, g’) Treatment of HeLa cells with medium containing delipidated serum (24h) does not
cause a reduction in transferrin uptake. Cells were treated with 25 μg/mL Alexa 488 coupled
transferrin for 30 minutes. Representative images (g) and quantification of the amount of
transferrin per cell in (g’) (n=5).
(h) Treatment of HeLa cells with medium containing delipidated serum (24h) does not
reduce association of transferrin containing vesicles with mitochondria. Crude mitochondria
were fractionated from cells growing in medium containing or lacking C18:0, and the
amount of transferrin that copurifies with mitochondria was analyzed and quantified by
immunoblotting. See Supplementary Information Figure 19 for image of the uncropped full
western blot.

C18:0 removal

(a) Treatment of HeLa cells with 1μM gambogic acid does not induce apoptosis. 10 μM,
gambogic acid was used as a positive control for apoptosis induction, assessed by cleaved
caspase-3 levels. 1μM gambogic acid neither induces caspase cleavage (shown here) nor
causes cells to die (not shown). Cells were treated with 10μM gambogic acid for 1 hour, or
for all other concentrations for 3 hours. See Supplementary Information Figure 20 for image

(d, d’) Removal of C18:0, as well as treatment with gambogic acid, induces shuttling of
phosphorylated Jun kinase into the nucleus. Cells were stained with phosho Jun kinase
antibody (d) and relative levels of nuclear to cytosolic phospho Jun kinase signal was
quantified (d’) (n=37 cells). ***p<0.001 of two tailed t-test. Error bars: s.d.
