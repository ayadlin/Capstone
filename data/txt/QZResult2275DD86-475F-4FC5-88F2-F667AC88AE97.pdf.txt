Abstract
The roles of the chemokine CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 in breast cancer progression remain unclear. Here, we
conducted microarray analysis on 2,254 human breast cancer specimens and found increased expression of CCL5
and its receptor CCR5, but not CCR3, in the basal and HER-2 genetic subtypes. The subpopulation of human breast
cancer cell lines found to express CCR5 displayed a functional response to CCL5. In addition, oncogene
transformation induced CCR5 expression, and the subpopulation of cells that expressed functional CCR5 also
displayed increased invasiveness. The CCR5 antagonists maraviroc or vicriviroc, developed to block CCR5 HIV
coreceptor function, reduced in vitro invasion of basal breast cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation or
viability, and maraviroc decreased pulmonary metastasis in a preclinical mouse model of breast cancer. Taken
together, our ﬁndings provide evidence for the key role of CCL5/CCR5 in the invasiveness of basal breast cancer
cells and suggest that CCR5 antagonists may be used as an adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of metastasis in
patients with the basal breast cancer subtype. Cancer Res; 72(15); 3839–50. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer causes the death of 40,000 women in the
United States and 410,000 women in the world annually (1).
Despite advances in the treatment of the disease, 20% to 30% of
patients with early breast cancers will experience relapse with
distant metastatic disease (2). In those patients, metastasis is
the main cause of death. Patients with basal tumors have
increased risk of metastasis and lower survival rate (3, 4).
Kennecke and colleagues studied 3,726 patients with breast
cancer and reported that the basal tumors have higher frequencies of metastases and reduced time from identiﬁcation of
metastases to death than that of patients with luminal A or B
tumors (4). The absence of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor (ER), and HER-2 commonly found in basal breast tumors (5)
means that they are unlikely to respond to hormone therapies
or HER-2–targeted therapies. Currently, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are the only choices for patients with basal

breast cancers, but all show poor outcomes (6). The need for a
speciﬁc targeted therapy for basal breast cancer remains
urgent.
Cancer metastasis is regulated by chemokines in the microenvironment (7). Chemokines bind to cell surface receptors
that belong to the G-protein–coupled receptor family (GPCR),
controlling diverse biologic and pathologic processes from
immunosurveillance, inﬂammation, and cancer. Previous
studies of human breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines
showed that the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 are
expressed in breast cancer cells, malignant breast tumors, and
metastasis. Their related ligands, CXCL12 (SDF1) and CCL21,
are also expressed at the site of metastasis (8). Subsequent
studies identiﬁed altered expression of CCL5 (RANTES) in
patients with breast cancer, correlating with disease progression (9–11).
CCL5 can be expressed and secreted either by breast cancer
cells (9–12) or by nonmalignant stromal cells at the primary or
metastatic sites (13). However, the roles of CCL5 and its
receptors in breast cancer are not fully understood. CCL5
facilitates disease progression by recruiting and modulating
the activity of inﬂammatory cells, which subsequently remodel
the tumor microenvironment (14, 15). Accordingly, inhibition
of CCR5 by a peptide antagonist reduced leukocyte inﬁltration
and reduced tumor growth after subcutaneous injection of
410.4 cells into immunocompetent mice (16). Studies analyzing
the role of CCR5 in breast cancer cell proliferation have used
mainly luminal MCF-7 cells and suggest a role for p53. Manes
and colleagues reported that abrogation of cell surface CCR5
expression enhanced MCF-7 cell proliferation in vivo in the
presence of p53 but did not affect proliferation in xenografts
encoding a p53 mutation (17). Murooka and colleagues
reported that in CCR5-transfected MCF-7 cells, CCL5

promotes proliferation and survival in an mTOR-dependent
manner (18). Autocrine secretion of CCL5 controls migration
and invasiveness of human breast cancer cells in vitro (12, 19).
Forced expression of CCL5 increased tumor metastasis
approximately 1.8-fold in one study of MDA-MB-231 cells but
had no effect in the 168 breast cancer cell line (13, 20).
Furthermore, other authors have shown that shRNA inhibition
of CCL5 expression in murine mammary cancer cells does not
affect growth rate or metastatic frequency in vivo (20).
Discrepancies in the reported effects of CCL5 and CCR5 in
breast cancer may be due to the different models used. To
study whether CCL5/CCR5 signaling is active in speciﬁc genetic subtypes of breast cancer, we analyzed the combined
expression of CCL5 and CCR5 using a microarray database
comprising 2,254 human breast cancer samples from 27 independent studies (21). This report is the ﬁrst to show that CCL5/
CCR5 signaling is preferentially active in the basal and HER-2
subtypes. Using basal-like breast cancer cell lines, we showed
that only a subpopulation of cells express CCR5 and respond to
CCL5. Importantly, CCR5þ cells displayed increased invasiveness, indicating that CCR5 contributes to the metastatic
phenotype of basal breast cancer cells. Therefore, we examined
the possibility that CCR5 inhibition may block the invasion and
metastasis of basal-like breast cancer cells. We used drugs
originally developed to prevent the interaction of CCR5 with
the gp120 from HIV-1. The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (Selzentry) received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval for use in treatment-naive adults with CCR5-trophic
HIV. Vicriviroc (SCH 417690), another CCR5 antagonist, has
shown good tolerance and partial therapeutic success in phase
II clinical trials for HIV (22). CCR5 inhibition blocked breast
cancer cell invasiveness in vitro and efﬁciently reduced metastatic colonization in vivo. The antimetastatic effect produced
by CCR5 inhibition was associated with reduced arrival of
breast cancer cells to the target tissue but was independent of
changes in cell proliferation or tumor growth. Our ﬁndings
suggest that CCR5 antagonists may be used to reduce the risk
of metastasis in patients with the basal subtype of breast
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Breast cancer patients data set and statistical analysis
A microarray data set that was previously compiled (21)
from the public repositories Gene Expression Omnibus (23)
and ArrayExpress (24) was used to evaluate CCR5 and CCL5
expression in the context of clinical samples. Samples in this
data set were assigned to 5 canonical breast cancer subtypes,
including luminal A, luminal B, normal-like, basal, and HER2–overexpressing disease. The classiﬁcation of microarray
samples among these 5 subtypes was achieved by computing
their correlation against an expression proﬁle centroid
representative of each subtype and assigning samples to
the subtype with the highest corresponding correlation
coefﬁcient (25). Samples with a maximum correlation coefﬁcient below 0.3 were considered unclassiﬁed. Analysis of
CCL5 and CCR5 transcript was then conducted speciﬁcally
among the luminal A, luminal B, basal, normal-like, and

3840

HER-2 subtypes. Differential expression of the averaged gene
signature magnitude among these sample subsets was evaluated using 2-tailed Student t test. Kaplan–Meier analysis
was used to evaluate survival trends within the sample
subsets. Scatter plots of CCL5 versus CCR5 samples were
also generated to observe coregulation patterns speciﬁc to
each subtype. For these scatter plots, gene proﬁles were
median-centered and scaled to unitary SD.
Cell lines and cell culture
MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and Hs578T cells were maintained in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS. SUM-159 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Stephen
Ethier, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) were maintained
in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 4 mg/mL of insulin, 1 mg/mL
of hydrocortisone, and 5% FBS. Oncogene-transformed derivatives of MCF-10A cells (MCF10A-NeuT, MCF10A-Src, and
MCF10A-Ras; ref. 26) were maintained in DMEM:Ham's F-12
(50 of 50) supplemented with 4 mg/mL of insulin, 10 ng/mL of
EGF, and 1 mg/mL of hydrocortisone. A total of 100 mg/mL of
each penicillin and streptomycin were included in all media.
Cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 C. For in vitro treatments,
maraviroc was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
diluted in culture medium. The ﬁnal concentration of DMSO in
treated and control cultures was 0.5%. Vicriviroc was dissolved
in culture medium.
Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis
Cell labeling and ﬂuorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS)
analysis for CCR5 were based on prior publications (27) with
minor modiﬁcations. Before labeling, the cells were blocked
with normal mouse IgG (1 of 100) and puriﬁed rat anti-mouse
Fcg III/II receptor antibody (1 of 100; Pharmingen) for 30
minutes and then incubated with allophycocyanin (APC)labeled CCR5 antibody (R&D Systems). All experiments were
conducted at 4 C. Sample analysis was conducted on FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). These data were
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Invasion assay
The 3-dimensional invasion assay was conducted as previously reported (12). Brieﬂy, 100 mL of 1.67 mg/mL Rat Tail
collagen type I (BD Biosciences) was pipetted into the top
chamber of a 24-well 8-mm pore Transwell (Corning). The
Transwell was incubated at 37 C overnight to allow the
collagen to solidify. A total of 30,000 cells were then seeded
on the bottom of the Transwell membrane and allowed to
attach. Serum-free growth medium was placed into the bottom
chamber, whereas 15 ng/mL CCL5 or 5% FBS was used as
a chemoattractant in the medium of the upper chamber. The
cells were then chemoattracted across the ﬁlter through the
collagen above for 3 days. Cells were ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS, and then stained
with 40 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI) for 2 hours. Fluorescence
was analyzed by confocal z-sections (one section every 20 mm)
at 10 magniﬁcation from the bottom of the ﬁlter using a Zeiss
LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope at the Kimmel
Cancer Center Bioimaging Facility.

Antimetastatic Effect of CCR5 Antagonist

Intracellular calcium assay
Calcium responses induced either by CCL5 or FBS in human
cancer cell lines were monitored under ﬂuorescence confocal
microscope as previously reported (28). Brieﬂy, breast cancer
cells were seeded in 4-well labtek chambers (Nunc) at 104
cells/cm2 and incubated for 1 day. After 12-hour starvation,
cells were labeled by incubating them with 2 mmol/L
Fluo-4-AM (Molecular Probes) in HBSS for 30 minutes, washed
twice, and incubated for additional 30 minutes before imaging
under the microscope. Time-lapse images were collected using
a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope with
the incubator at 37 C. Relative intracellular Ca2þ concentration was determined by the changes in ﬂuorescent intensity
(FI) of Fluo-4-AM upon the addition of CCL5 (60 ng/mL) or FBS
(5%) and was calculated as (FIt  FI0)/FI0.
MTT assay
The effects of CCR5 antagonists on cell viability and proliferation rate were estimated using the soluble tetrazolium salt
MTT assay (29). MTT is reduced by the mitochondria of viable
cells, and the amount of reduced formazan is proportional to
the number of viable cells. After 72 hours of exposure to the
drugs, cells were incubated with 1 mg/mL of MTT for 90
minutes. Then, the reduced (insoluble and colored) formazan
was dissolved in DMSO and measured spectrophotometrically
at 570 nm. The effect of CCR5 overexpression in breast cancer
cell proliferation was studied in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected
with full-length human CCR5 subcloned into pcDNA3.1þ/Zeoþ
vector (kindly provided by Dr. Eleanor Fish, University of
Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada) and selected with Zeocin
(200 mg/mL) as previously described (18). MTT assays were
conducted in sextuplicate using 96-well microplates.
Viral cell transduction
A lentiviral vector encoding ﬁreﬂy luciferase 2 (Luc2)-eGFP
fusion protein was a generous gift from Dr. Sanjiv S. Gambhir
(School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; ref. 30).
Lentivirus propagation was conducted following the protocol
described by Zahler and colleagues (31). Breast cancer cell lines
were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 20 in the
presence of 8 mg/mL polybrene (Sigma) for 24 hours (30, 31).
Experimental metastasis assay and bioluminescence
imaging
MB-MDA-231 cells expressing Luc2-eGFP (called MDA.
pFLUG for the rest of the article) were detached with a
nonenzymatic cell dissociation buffer (4 mmol/L EDTA in
Ca2þ and Mg2þ-free PBS), resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS
without Ca2þ and Mg2þ and immediately injected into the tail
vein of 8-week-old, female nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice (NCI, Bethesda MD). Each
mouse received 106 cells. Mice were treated by oral gavage with
maraviroc (8 mg/kg every 12 hours) or vehicle (5% DMSO in
acidiﬁed water; ref. 32). Treatment was started immediately
after injection or 10 days later for the experiments analyzing
the proliferation of established metastasis. For in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI), mice were given an intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection with 200 mL of D-luciferin (30 mg/mL). Mice

www.aacrjournals.org

were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (2% in 1 L/min oxygen), and
bioluminescence images were acquired 10 to 15 minutes after
D-luciferin injection using the IVIS XR system (Caliper Life
Sciences). Acquisition times ranged from 10 seconds (for later
time points) to 5 minutes (for early time points). Data are
expressed as total photon ﬂux and were analyzed using Living
Image 3.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences). For ex vivo BLI,
D-luciferin was diluted in PBS to a ﬁnal concentration of
300 mg/mL and used to soak freshly isolated lungs for 2 to 3
minutes before imaging. Some lungs were stained with India
ink, as previously reported (33), or processed and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin to corroborate the presence of pulmonary tumors. For homing assays, mice were euthanized
24 hours after the intravenous injection of MDA.pFULG cells.
Lungs were perfused with PBS, ﬁxed with freshly prepared
formaldehyde (4% in PBS), and frozen in optimum cutting
temperature (Sakura Finetek). Cryosections (10 mm) were
counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole analyzed
by confocal microscopy. Animal experiments were approved
by the Thomas Jefferson University's Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Reagents and antibodies
CCL5 (catalog no. 278-RN) and anti-CCR5 APC antibody
(catalog no. FAB1802A) were purchased from R&D Systems. A
rabbit anti-human CCR5 polyclonal antibody (GenScipt; catalog no. A00979) was used for immunohistochemical staining.
Rat tail collagen type I was purchased from BD Biosciences.
Vicriviroc and maraviroc were obtained from Selleck Chemicals. Luciferin was obtained from Gold Biotechnology.

Results
Active CCL5/CCR5 signaling in basal breast cancer
To examine the relative abundance of CCL5 and its receptor
CCR5 by genetic subtype, interrogation was conducted within
a combined microarray database comprising 2,254 human
breast cancer samples from 27 independent studies (21). The
relative abundances of CCL5 and CCR5 were signiﬁcantly
increased in the basal and HER-2 subtypes compared with
the normal-like, luminal A and luminal B subtypes (Fig. 1A).
The increased expression of CCL5 and CCR5 correlated positively in individual breast cancer samples and the correlation
was highly signiﬁcant in the basal and HER-2 subtypes (Fig.
1B). The proportion of patients with a CCL5/CCR5-positive
signature was more than 58% in the basal and HER-2 subtypes
(Fig. 1C). In agreement with previous reports, clinical information of the cases in this database showed that the probability to develop metastasis is increased in the basal, luminal B,
and HER-2 subtypes (Fig. 1D).
To determine the gene expression signaling pathway associated with enrichment of CCR5 and CCL5, GSEA analysis
using KEGG and GO was conducted of these tumor samples
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). These studies showed enrichment
for gene expression of pathways including lymphocyte activation, Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling, and Tolllike receptor activation (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The receptors for CCL5 include CCR1 and CCR3. Increased expression of
CCL5 associated with increased CCR1, but not CCR3, in the

Analysis of CCR5 expression by FACS showed that a small
subpopulation of cells were positive for the receptor in all 3
cell lines (Fig. 2A for MDA-MB-231 and Supplementary Fig.
S3A and S3C for Hs578T and SUM-159). Because CCR5
activation induces calcium ﬂux (38, 39), we assessed the
activation of calcium signaling by CCL5. Addition of CCL5 to
the cultures induced immediate calcium ﬂuxes in a subpopulation of cells (Fig. 2B for MDA-MB-231 and Supplementary
Fig. S3B and S3D for Hs578T and SUM-159), providing
evidence that CCR5 is functional in basal breast cancer
cells. As a positive control, the same cultures were exposed
to 5% FBS (40). Calcium ﬂux, assessed by relative ﬂuorescence intensity, increased in more than 95% of the cells after
FBS addition (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3D).

cells were stably transduced with a CCR5 expression vector
and the Caþ2 response to CCL5 versus FBS was conducted
(Supplementary Figs. S4C and D vs. S4E and F). CCR5
induced Caþ2 signaling in the CCR5-overexpressing cells,
whereas both lines responded similarly to FBS induced Caþ2
activation (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We next assessed the effect of CCR5 activation on breast
cancer cell invasion using 3D migration assays. CCL5
induced invasion of the basal MDA-MB-231, Hs578T,
SUM-159 but not the luminal MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C and D).
CCL5 promoted invasion of MCF-10A cells engineered to

with MCF10A vector-transduced cells (Fig. 2E and F), suggesting that CCL5 responsiveness may be acquired during
transformation and requires speciﬁc cooperative oncogenic
signals. The ﬁnding that CCL5 induced cellular invasion led
us to examine the migratory capacity of CCR5þ cells versus
that of CCR5 cells. Within the same SUM-159 breast cancer
cell line, CCR5þ cells showed an approximately 40-fold
greater cellular invasiveness (Fig. 2G and H), indicating that
the expression of CCR5 correlates with a proinvasive
phenotype.

CCR5 antagonists block breast cancer calcium signaling
and cell invasion
The importance of CCR5 in HIV infection led to the
development of different drugs that target this receptor.
We therefore examined whether the CCR5 antagonists maraviroc and vicriviroc were capable of blocking the CCL5/
CCR5 signaling in basal breast cancer cells. Both CCR5
antagonists blocked CCL5-induced calcium mobilization. In
MDA-MB-231 cells, maraviroc and vicriviroc inhibited calcium responses by 65% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 3A and B).
Similar observations were made with both drugs in Hs578T
cells (Fig. 3C and D), indicating that CCR5 expressed in
different basal breast cancer cells is sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition.
To evaluate the functional relevance of CCR5 in cellular
migration and invasion, we tested the effects of maraviroc
and vicriviroc in 3D invasion assays. Using 2 different cell
lines, we found that both CCR5 antagonists inhibited FBSinduced breast cancer cell invasion at the clinically relevant
concentration of 100 nmol/L (Fig. 4A–D). Thus, the proinvasive effect of CCR5 can be abrogated by using speciﬁc
antagonists.

CCR5 inhibition blocks breast cancer metastasis in vivo
In view of the ﬁnding that CCR5 inhibition by CCR5 antagonists reduced calcium signaling and cell invasion, we determined the in vivo effect of maraviroc on lung metastasis. We
used MDA-MB-231 cells transduced within the Luc2-eGFP
lentiviral vector (MDA.pFULG cells) in an experimental metastasis model. The Luc2 gene is a codon-optimized version of Luc
and cells expressing this reporter were 10 to 100 times brighter
than the unmodiﬁed Luc gene (30). After injection of MDA.
pFULG cells into the tail vein of mice, noninvasive BLI enabled
the early detection of breast cancer metastasis (41). Weekly BLI
was conducted for 5 weeks and the radiance antemortem was
used as a surrogate measurement of tumor burden. Mice
treated with maraviroc (8 mg/kg twice daily) showed a significant reduction in both the number and the size of pulmonary
metastases compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5A and B,
Supplementary Fig. S5). To avoid the possibility that metastases were missed because of inappropriate imaging, we conducted ex vivo imaging, India ink staining (Fig. 5C), and
histology (Fig. 5E) of the lungs. Histologic analysis corroborated that tumor burden corresponds to bioluminescence, as
previously shown (30). Metastatic tumors were still detectable
in 50% of the maraviroc-treated mice, but their mean size was
reduced by 65% (Fig. 5D and F). Interestingly, analysis of CCR5
expression in lungs from control mice showed an 8-fold
enrichment of the CCR5þ fraction (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Collectively, these results provide evidence that CCR5 antagonists reduce breast cancer metastasis in vivo.
CCR5 antagonist impairs lung colonization but not cell
proliferation or tumor growth
We determined whether the reduction in metastatic
tumors by maraviroc involved changes in cellular proliferation and/or target organ colonization. We analyzed the

effect of CCR5 inhibition on cell viability and proliferation
both in vitro and in vivo. Maraviroc or vicriviroc treatment of
MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 hours did not affect the MTT
reduction, which was used as a surrogate measurement of
cancer cell number (Fig. 6A). In agreement, overexpression
of CCR5 in MDA-MB-231 cells did not modify their proliferation rate compared with cells transfected with the empty
vector (Fig. 6B and C). Finally, maraviroc treatment of mice
with established pulmonary metastasis did not modify
tumor growth (Fig. 6D and E), indicating that CCR5 activation does not promote the proliferation of basal breast
cancer cells in vitro nor in the pulmonary microenvironment
of immunocompromised mice.
On a different in vivo experiment, we examined the effect of
maraviroc on breast cancer cell homing to lungs. To reach a
steady-state concentration in plasma and tissues, mice were
given 10 administrations of maraviroc (twice a day for 5 days)
before the intravenous injection of MDA.pFULG cells (Fig. 6F).
Inoculation of equal numbers of MDA.pFULG cells in control
and treated groups was corroborated by BLI immediately after
injection. Maraviroc reduced the number of eGFPþ cells in the
lungs by 40% (Fig 6G and H), suggesting that the in vivo
antimetastatic effect of maraviroc is caused by a reduction in
the number of cancer cells that colonize the target organ from
the circulation.

Discussion
The current studies show for the ﬁrst time that: (i)
enrichment of CCL5/CCR5 expression occurs in patients
with basal and Her2 positive genetic subtypes of breast
cancer; (ii) oncogenic transformation of immortalized
human breast cells by distinct oncogenes induces CCL5
responsiveness; and (iii) maraviroc, an FDA-approved drug

features of the basal subtype of breast cancer (including the
lack of HER-2, ER, and progesterone receptor), a basal-like
molecular signature, the activation of speciﬁc signaling pathways (e.g., hypoxic or EGF receptor responses) and overexpression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition proteins (FN, VIM,
and matrix metalloproteinase 2; refs. 34–37). Only a small
fraction of cells within the cell lines used in this study

uller and colleagues who

CCR5 in MDA-MB-23 cells by reverse transcriptase PCR and
showed the presence of the CCR5 protein by FACS analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S7), and showed that CCR5 immunohistochemical staining was localized primarily to the breast
cancer epithelial cell, compared with normal breast tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S8).

We showed that CCL5 activates calcium ﬂux in basal-like
human breast cancer cells, as previously described in cells of
the immune system (39, 43) and CCR5-transfected cells
(27, 44, 45). By using the selective CCR5-antagonists maraviroc
and vicriviroc (both with IC50 below 30 nmol/L; refs. 44, 45), we
showed that CCL5-activated signaling is mediated by CCR5.
However, the fraction of CCL5-responsive cells (10% and 12%
for MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells, respectively) is higher than
the percentage of CCR5-expressing cells determined by FACS.
This may be due to the greater sensitivity of the Ca2þ activation
assays compared with the sensitivity of analysis by FACS. In
addition, CCL5-induced calcium redistribution is not
completely blocked by CCR5 antagonists. This may be caused
by the expression of other receptors to CCL5, namely CCR1 and
CCR3. CCR5 has been identiﬁed as the main CCL5 receptor in
MDA-MB-231 cells (13) and CCR1 and CCR3 transcripts are
absent in both MDA-MB-231 or Hs578T cell lines (8) and breast
tumor samples (11). We were able to detect CCR1 and CCR3 by
FACS (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting a possible mechanism for the incomplete response to the CCR5 antagonist.
We observed that the subpopulation of CCR5þ cells displayed increased invasiveness, indicating that CCR5 favors cell
migration and invasion in basal-like breast cancer cells. The
failure of luminal-like MCF-7 cells to respond to CCL5 is in
agreement with previous publications (12). Our studies also
showed that CCR5 inhibition with either maraviroc or vicriviroc reduced in vitro FBS-induced breast cancer cellular
invasion without affecting cellular viability. The ﬁnding that
CCR5 antagonists block FBS-induced invasion is novel and
suggested that CCR5 activation contribute to the production of
metastasis in vivo where different chemotactic and growth
signals are present. The mechanisms involved in CCR5 regulation of FBS-activated invasiveness are uncharacterized but
they may include heterodimerization and ligand afﬁnity regulation of other GPCRs (46), or the transactivation of growth
factor receptor- (47) or integrin-mediated signaling (48), as
described in noncancerous cells.
The in vivo antimetastatic effect of maraviroc was shown by
injecting MDA.pFULG cells into the circulation of immunodeﬁcient mice and treating them with clinically relevant doses
of the drug. In humans, oral doses of 300 mg produce an
average Cmax of 1,200 nmol/L (49), whereas in mice 16 mg/kg
produce an average Cmax of 1,045 nmol/L (32). Because the drug
is taken twice a day in the clinical setting, we administered 16
mg/kg/d divided into 2 doses during our experiments. Maraviroc signiﬁcantly reduced the pulmonary tumor burden.
Although it has been proposed that pharmacologic CCR5
inhibition may be beneﬁcial for patients with breast cancer,
to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst study showing that systemic
administration of a CCR5 antagonist reduces metastatic colonization of basal breast cancer cells.
The antimetastatic effect of maraviroc is not caused
by alterations in growth of established metastasis. CCR5
activation by CCL5 drives proliferation in CCR5-transfected
MCF-7 breast cancer cells (18) and prostate cancer cells (50),
but this study and others (13) showed that the CCL5/CCR5
axis does not play a role in cell proliferation or survival in the
basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of

3848

Cancer Res; 72(15) August 1, 2012

CCR5 surface expression through a dominant-negative form
of CCR5 (CCR5D32) in MDA-MB-231 cells does not change
in vivo proliferation or apoptotic response (17). On the other
hand, we found that maraviroc reduces lung colonization by
MDA.pFULG cancer cells. This result is consistent with
previous studies in which inhibition of CCR5 expression
within breast cancer cells or administration of anti-CCL5
neutralizing antibody to tumor-bearing mice reduced the
enhanced metastatic capability induced by coinjection of
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC; ref. 13). The authors identiﬁed cancer cell extravasation as the crucial metastatic
step affected by CCL5/CCR5 inhibition (13). Together, these
data support a role for CCR5 antagonists in blocking the
ability of basal breast cancer cells to reach the metastatic
sites instead of inhibiting their proliferation or survival
after arrival. Blocking the homing of cancer cells to metastatic sites is a desirable characteristic in a true antimetastatic drug (51). Therefore, CCR5 antagonists may be useful
as adjuvant therapy for breast basal tumors with CCR5
overexpression or other tumor types where CCR5 promotes
metastasis, such as prostate cancer (50) or gastric cancer
(52). Our preclinical studies will expedite the path toward
the clinical use of CCR5 antagonists as new treatments for
dissemination of basal breast cancer.
