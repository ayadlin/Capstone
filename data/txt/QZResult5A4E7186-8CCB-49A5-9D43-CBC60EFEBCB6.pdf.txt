Chemotherapeutic Agents

Abstract
Approximately half of all gliomas are resistant to chemotherapy, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently
needed to treat this cancer. We hypothesized that disrupting iron homeostasis in glioma cells could block tumor
growth, based on an acute requirement for high levels of iron to meet energy requirements associated with their
rapid growth. Ferritin is best known as an intracellular iron storage protein, but it also localizes to tumor cell
nuclei where it seems to protect DNA from oxidative damage and to promote transcription. In this study, we
hypothesize that silencing the H-ferritin (heavy chain ferritin) gene could increase tumor sensitivity to
chemotoxins. To test this hypothesis, H-ferritin siRNA was delivered to several human cancer cell lines by
using cationic liposomes (C-liposome). H-ferritin siRNA decreased protein expression by 80% within 48 hours,
and this decrease was associated with more than 50% decrease in the LD50 for DNA-alkylating agent carmustine
(BCNU), which is commonly used to treat glioma in clinic. In a subcutaneous mouse model of human glioma,
intratumoral injections of liposomes containing H-ferritin siRNA reduced the effective dose of BCNU needed for
tumor suppression by more than 50%. A plasmid supercoil relaxation assay showed that H-ferritin specifically
and directly protected DNA from BCNU treatment. H-ferritin siRNA additionally seemed to increase apoptosis in
glioma cells in vitro upon H-ferritin knockdown. Overall, our results illustrate how silencing H-ferritin can
effectively sensitize tumors to chemotherapy and also show the ability of C-liposomes to serve as a novel in vivo
delivery tool for siRNAs. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2240–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant glioblastoma multiforme is a deadly brain tumor
for which there is no effective treatment. The limitations
associated with treatment strategies include drug-resistant
characteristics of the tumors, inability of chemotoxic agents to
traverse the blood–brain barrier in effective amounts, radiation toxicity to normal brain tissue, and potential risk of
significant neurologic damage associated with tumor resection in elegant brain regions. Administration of higher dosages
of chemotherapeutic agents is generally not an option,
because they are often accompanied by stronger adverse side
effects (1); the same is true of increasing radiation toxicity (2).
One effective way to increase efficacy of therapeutic agents is
to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to these agents.

Herein, we propose to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutics by using cationic liposomes (C-liposome) that are
capable of delivering therapeutically effective concentrations
of siRNA to tumors cells.
The use of siRNAs for treating cancer is an area of considerable interest, and many promising siRNAs have been
previously identified. More than 28 genes have been evaluated
as siRNA targets in different types of cancer. VEGF siRNA is
implicated for treating fibrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and
prostate cancer, and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
siRNA is implicated for the treatment of glioma (3). The major
focus of our efforts to find a suitable target gene for siRNA has
been ferritin, which is a key protein in maintaining cellular
iron homeostasis (4). Ferritin tightly regulates the intracellular
availability of iron in aerobic or anaerobic organisms (5) and is
thus essential to cell viability. It functions as an iron-storage
and -regulating protein in the cytosol, mitochondria, and
nucleus (6). Iron is an essential trace element for cell growth
and proliferation, as it is involved in a variety of redox
reactions (7), which makes it essential for maintaining cellular
homeostasis (8). We identified ferritin as a potential target for
siRNA therapy after it was discovered that one of the ferritin
subunits, H-ferritin (heavy chain ferritin), was present in the
nuclei of glioma cells (6, 9). Nuclear ferritin is distributed
nonrandomly, with preferential association with heterochromatin, which suggests that it might be involved in facilitating

H-Ferritin siRNA Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Chemotoxin

DNA synthesis (9, 10). Ferritin in the nucleus has a protective
function, as shown by its ability to protect DNA of corneal
epithelial cells from UV damage and oxidative stress (11–13).
Ferritin may also play a role in drug resistance mechanisms, as
repeated exposure of cells to hydroxyurea results in an
increased resistance to this toxic agent and an increase in
ferritin mRNA (14). Ferritin overexpression is associated with
the development of various cancers (15–19). On the basis of
these reports, we hypothesized that downregulation of Hferritin by siRNA in cancer cells could provide a mechanism to
increase the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of tumors by eliminating the protective functions of H-ferritin. To test our
hypothesis, C-liposomes carrying H-ferritin siRNA were prepared and characterized and the vulnerability of tumor cells
treated with H-ferritin siRNA to chemotherapy was verified in
vitro and in vivo.
BCNU [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea] is one of the
carmustines which is primarily used in brain tumor therapy,
either as single agent or in combination with other drugs, due
to its ability to cross blood–brain barrier. It is one of the few
drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
treating malignant glioma, with a reported response rate of up
to 30%. It generally acts by alkylation of DNA and RNA and
unlike other alkylating agents, it is not cross-resistant to other
alkylators. It also acts by inhibiting several key enzymatic
processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in the proteins.
Although BCNU has been reported to have superior activity,
its clinical use is limited because of serious side effects. We
chose BCNU in this study to determine whether silencing Hferritin expression in cell and xenograft in vivo models could
significantly decrease the effective therapeutic dose.

Materials and Methods
DC-cholesterol/DOPE lipids (30:70 w/w) and rhodaminelabeled phospholipids [L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt)] were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. BCNU (carmustine) was
purchased from Sigma. Fluorescent siRNA and early endosomal antigen antibody (EEA1) were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The nonspecific (NS) siRNA was from Qiagen,
Inc. The H-ferritin antibody was a gift from Dr. Paolo Arosio
(Milan, Italy). Female adult athymic nude mice were
purchased from Charles Rivers Laboratories, Inc. Chamber
slides were obtained from Nalgene Nunc International, Inc.
MTS/PMS reagent [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium/phenazine
methosulfate assay] was purchased from Promega, Inc.
Cell culture
U251, U87, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
cell line sNF96.2 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection, which were cultured according to the company's
instruction sheet and maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed
Eagle's medium (DMEM; GIBCO) supplemented with 10%
FBS (v/v), 0.1% (v/v) Gentamicin Reagent Solution (Gibco),
and 1% (v/v) Non-essential Amino Acid Solution (Sigma).
MCF-7 cell was a gift cell line from Dr. Andrea Manni, Penn

www.aacrjournals.org

State University, Hershey, PA. These cells were maintained,
according to the author's instructions, in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v) and 0.1% (w/v) insulin from
bovine pancreas (Gibco). All cells were maintained in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 C. The
cumulative culture length of all the cell lines was less than
6 months. All the cells were originally tested and certified by
the provider or the company.
Preparation of C-liposomes
To formulate the C-liposomes, lipids were dissolved in
methanol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) and subsequently rotary evaporated to obtain a lipid film, which was dried over N2 and
further dried at 4 C in a desiccator overnight. The lipid film
was hydrated in PBS (2.8 mg/mL w/v) and sonicated. A
polycarbonate membrane of gradually decreasing pore size
was used to produce small unilamellar vesicles by extrusion
through a 2-stacked, 0.1-mm polycarbonate membrane and
subsequently with a 0.05-mm membrane, using a nitrogen
pressure–operated extruder (LIPEX Extruder; Northern
Lipids, Inc.). All the extrusions were carried out 10 times
at an operating pressure of 800 psi (5,440 kPa). To study
cellular uptake, the C-liposomes were labeled with rhodamine by adding a 1% (molar ratio) of rhodamine-labeled
phospholipids [L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine-N-(lissamine
rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt)] to the liposome
formulation.
Characterization of C-liposomes
The size distribution of C-liposomes was determined by
light scattering analysis, using an ALV/DLS/SLS-5022F compact goniometer system (ALV). The zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI) of C-liposomes were measured by the
PALS Zeta Potential Analyzer (Ver. 3.16; Brookhaven Instruments Corp.). The PDI represents the distribution of particle
size of the liposomes in a given medium or buffer in which
they are suspended.
Cytotoxicity of C-liposomes
To evaluate the potential cytotoxicity of the C-liposomes,
U251 cells (4,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates and
allowed to attach overnight. The cells were transfected with 0,
2, 4, or 6 mL of the C-liposome stock in DMEM serum-free
media. After 3 hours, the medium was replaced with complete
medium. An MTS assay was conducted at 24, 48, and 72 hours
posttransfection. The cytotoxicity of C-liposomes was also
evaluated in mice. Athymic nude mice were divided into 3
groups, with 3 mice in each group. Control mice were injected
with 50 mL of PBS. For the treatment groups, 6 mL of Cliposomes and 6 mL/1.5 mg of C-liposomes:siRNA complex was
injected intraperitoneally once per week for a total of 6 weeks.
After 6 weeks, 300 mL of the blood was collected through tail
vein. Liver and kidney toxicity, total bilirubin, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), creatine, aspartate amino transferase (AST,
also called SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, also called
SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase were determined using an
automated chemistry analyzer and kits from Thermo Electron
Inc., according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Formation of C-liposomes and siRNA complexes
To determine the best ratio of C-liposomes and siRNA, Cliposomes and siRNA-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) were
mixed on ice under the following 6 conditions: ratio of Cliposomes:siRNA (v/w) mL/mg, 0:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1. The
mixtures were equilibrated at room temperature for 5 minutes
and then DNA loading buffer was added. The samples were
then loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and electrophoresed at
100 V for 18 minutes in TAE buffer. The image was taken by an
image reader (FujiFilm LAS-3000).
Uptake of C-liposomes:siRNA
To visualize the uptake of the C-liposomes:siRNA complex
by cells, U251 cells (10,000 per well) and U87 cells (20,000 cells
per well) were seeded in 8-well chamber slides and allowed to
attach overnight. After exposing the cells to serum-free media
for 1 hour, cultures were exposed to siRNA-FITC:DMEM (1 mg/
1 mL), or C-liposomes-rhodamine:siRNA-FITC:DMEM (4 mL/1
mg/1 mL) for 1 hour. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently stained with 1% (w/v) of DAPI
(4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in DMEM, mounted, and dried
overnight. The cells were analyzed on a confocal microscope
(Leica TCS SP2; Leica Microsystems) and subject to Z-plane
sectioning (0.6-mm steps), followed by averaging by the
method of SDs to obtain the final image.
Internalization of C-liposomes by the endosomal
pathway
To determine whether the C-liposomes were internalized
into cells via the endosomal pathway, we investigated colocalization of C-liposomes with the early endosomal marker
EEA1. The cells were treated as in the preceding paragraph,
with the exception that following fixation, immunocytochemistry was conducted using a primary antibody for the endosomal marker EEA1 (1:15 dilution), subsequently followed by a
secondary FITC-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (1:500
dilution). Images were captured through a confocal microscope.
Western blot analysis
The level of H-ferritin expression in each of the cell lines
under investigation was determined by Western blot analysis.
Briefly, U251 cells were allowed to attach overnight and were
subsequently transfected with C-liposomes:siRNA (4 mL/1 mg)
in 1 mL of DMEM for 3 hours before the media was replaced
with complete media in which the DMEM was supplemented
with 10% FBS. Lysates were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma) at 24, 48, and 72
hours posttransfection and Western blotting for H-ferritin was
done (6). Bands were scanned by a densitometer (GS-800
Calibrated; Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One4.5.0 software (Bio-Rad). The data quantified are expressed
as a percentage of the controls.
Chemotherapeutic sensitivity
To test the hypothesis that H-ferritin siRNA will increase
chemotherapeutic sensitivity, U251 and sNF96.2 cells (2,000
cells per well) and MCF-7 cells (4,000 per well) were seeded

2242

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

into 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cultures
were transfected with C-liposomes:siRNA (4 mL/1 mg) in 1 mL
of DMEM for 3 hours before the media was replaced with
complete media. At 48 hours posttransfection, cells were
exposed to BCNU for 48 hours at concentrations of 0, 20,
40, 60, 80, and 100 mmol/L. An SRB (sulforhodamine B) assay
was done 48 hours after BCNU exposure. Data were expressed
as a percentage of the control with respect to the untreated
cells.
H-ferritin expression in vivo
To show that the H-ferritin siRNA delivered to tumors in
vivo decreased H-ferritin expression, subcutaneous tumors
were prepared by implanting 15  106 human U251 glioma
cells in the flank of adult female athymic nude mice. When the
tumor volume reached 10 to 14 mm3 in 2 weeks, the mice were
randomly assigned to receive (a) 0.1 mol/L PBS, (b) C-liposomes:NS siRNA, or (c) C-liposomes:H-ferritin siRNA. Tumors
were excised 48 hours postinjection and homogenized with
RIPA buffer. Total protein was isolated and analyzed for Hferritin expression by Western blot analysis.
Chemotherapeutic efficacy in vivo
To test the chemotherapeutic sensitivity in vivo, subcutaneous tumors were prepared as described earlier. When
tumors reached 10 to 14 mm3, mice were randomly assigned
to receive (a) C-liposomes:NS siRNA or (b) C-liposomes:Hferritin siRNA (6 mL/1.5 mg). In both cases, the C-liposomes
were injected intratumorally on a weekly basis. The day after
C-liposomes were injected, all of the animals received intraperitoneal injections of BCNU. The BCNU was delivered on the
opposite side of the tumor at a dosage of 12.5 mg/kg of body
weight. This regimen was conducted for a total of 7 weeks.
Tumor volume was recorded weekly by an individual blinded
to the treatment strategy. A group receiving only BCNU was
not included in this study for humane reasons, as the effect of
BCNU alone on tumors is well established in the literature
(20). Moreover, the aim of this study was to compare mice
receiving H-ferritin siRNA with mice receiving the NS siRNA in
order to determine whether there is a difference in efficacy
between these 2 groups.
Supercoil relaxation assays
To determine whether the protection provided by H-ferritin
could be directly on DNA, DNA backbone cleavage was
determined by a supercoil relaxation assay. Covalently closed
circular pUC19 DNA plasmid (BioLabs) was utilized, as has
been in our previous experiments (6). For the experiments
herein, 1 mg of plasmid was dissolved in 10 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 2.5 mmol/L
DTT (total volume 30 mL), which allows the resolution of
topoisomers under standard electrophoresis without ethidium bromide. The plasmid and reaction mixture was treated
with BCNU in the presence or absence of H- or L-ferritin for 1
hour at 37 C and terminated with 50% (v/v) glycerol, 50
mmol/L EDTA, and 0.1% bromophenol blue. The sample
was loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel and run under 40 mA for
6 or 8 hours at room temperature. After the electrophoresis,

H-Ferritin siRNA Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Chemotoxin

Apoptotic effects
To determine whether H-ferritin siRNA induced apoptotic
pathways, U251 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a
density of 166,000 cells per well and MCF-7 cells at a density
of 333,000 cells per well and allowed to attach overnight.
Cultures were transfected using C-liposomes:siRNA:DMEM (4
mL/1 mg/1 mL) for 3 hours before media was replaced with
complete media. Cell lysate was collected using the lysis buffer
from the Caspase-3 Fluorometric Assay Kit (R&D catalogue no
BF1100) at 48 hours posttransfection, and the assay was
conducted following the manufacturer's instruction.
Statistical analysis
Student's t tests were conducted as appropriate to determine whether significant differences existed between groups.
A value of P < 0.05 was regarded as significant.

Results
Uniformly sized C-liposomes
The average particle size for 3 different batches of Cliposomes was 95 nm and ranged from 80 to 180 nm
(Fig. 1A). The PDI of C-liposomes fell within the range of
0.1 to 0.2 (X PDI ¼ 0.168, SD ¼ 0.0065). The mean zeta
potential for different batches of the C-liposomes equaled
35 mV (0.25) before complexation and 5 mV (0.25) after
complexation with siRNA. The maximal optimal ratio of Cliposomes:siRNA 4 mL/1 mg (8 mL) in 1 mL of DMEM was 4:1 (v/
w) C-liposomes:siRNA (Fig. 1B). Increasing the concentration
of C-liposomes beyond this ratio did not result in an increased
siRNA load. No cytotoxicity, based on cell viability assays
(Fig. 1C), was observed with increasing concentrations of
C-liposomes (2, 4, and 6 mL of C-liposome stock per mL of
media).
Cellular uptake of C-liposomes:siRNA
No uptake was detected in U251 cells (Fig. 2A; top panels, c)
or in U87 cells (Fig. 2B; top panels, k), when cells were exposed
to FITC-labeled siRNA without C-liposomes. Uptake was
observed in both U251 (Fig. 2A; bottom panels, g) and U87
cells (Fig. 2B; bottom panels, o) when the cells were exposed to
the FITC-labeled siRNA with C-liposomes-rhodamine. Following the exposure of the cells to C-liposomes-rhodamine, the
cells were immunostained for the early endosomal marker
EEA1. Colocalization of C-liposomes and early endosomal
marker EEA1 evidently indicated that uptake of the C-liposomes was through the endosomal pathway, which was consistent with our previous report for nanovesicle uptake (21).

injection. This concentration of BCNU is less than 50% of the
reported effective dose (20) and was chosen on the basis of the
decreased LD50 observed in the human cell culture. The study
was terminated at week 7 because the tumor growth was too
large to continue in the control group.

The action of BCNU on DNA coiling was inhibited by
rH-ferritin
A supercoil relaxation assay using DNA plasmid pUC19
revealed that BCNU exposure converts DNA to the supercoiled
form with a concomitant decrease in the linear form of DNA
(Fig. 5A). This effect was attenuated by rH-ferritin (Fig. 5A
and B) but not by horse spleen ferritin, which is composed of
95% L-ferritin (Fig. 5B).

H-ferritin siRNA increased caspase-3 activity in U251
and MCF-7 cells
Caspase-3 activity was evaluated 48 hours posttransfection
of C-liposomes:siRNA. The presence of siRNA for H-ferritin in
U251 cells increased caspase-3 activity by 100% (***P < 0.0005;
Fig. 6A) and 20% in MCF-7 cells (*P < 0.05; Fig. 6B) compared
with cells transfected with NS siRNA.

Discussion
The following in vitro and in vivo results of this study were
obtained: (i) C-liposomes composed of DC-cholesterol/DOPE
lipids were nontoxic in vitro and in vivo. (ii) C-liposomes could
complex with siRNA to form C-liposomes:siRNA, which was
internalized into the cells through the endosomal pathway.

(iii) H-ferritin siRNA downregulated H-ferritin expression in
cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo and resulted in increased
vulnerability of glioma U251, sNF96.2, and breast cancer MCF7 cells to chemotherapy. (iv) An antitumor effect of H-ferritin
siRNA may be associated with its ability to alter the ability of
BCNU, a DNA-alkaylating agent to convert DNA to a supercoiled form, and maintain a significant portion of DNA in the
relaxed and linear form which is associated with increased
transcription. This function would be consistent with the
presence of ferritin in the nucleus of cancer cells and our
previous results suggesting H-ferritin promotes DNA relaxation (6, 10). (v) Downregulation of H-ferritin protein expression increased activation of caspase-3. Ferritin is typically
considered a stable cytosolic iron-storage protein with slow
turnover, thus targeting this protein with siRNA may seem
counterintuitive. However, it has been reported that the halflife of cytosolic ferritin in K562 cells (22), human fibroblast
cells (23), and HeLa cells (24) is approximately 12 hours. These
data are consistent with the dramatic downregulation of H-

ferritin seen within 24 hours in the human astrocytoma cell
line. The results from this project are a promising initial step
toward the development of siRNA gene therapy involving Hferritin for the treatment of multiple tumor types. A crucial
component of siRNA gene therapy is an effective delivery
mechanism.
C-liposomes were selected as a gene delivery vehicle for this
study as an extension of the nanotechnology platform currently in use in our laboratory (21, 25). The C-liposomes in this
study and the neutralized liposomes used in our previous
studies share some common physical properties. Both were
simple to prepare at a nanometer scale with similar methods
and are nontoxic. Both liposomes are internalized by glioma
cells through endosomal pathways; however, the C-liposomes
were synthesized with positively charged lipids, so they were
capable of forming a complex with siRNA or DNA by electrostatic interactions (26). Cytotoxicity and transfection
efficiency of C-liposomes depend on the scale and uniformity of their size. During the preparation process, multiple

Figure 5. Influence of H-ferritin on DNA relaxation as evidenced by a supercoil relaxation assay. A, the effect of BCNU with H-ferritin on DNA. The
DNA plasmid pUC19 was treated with incremental concentrations of BCNU in the presence (left) or absence (right) of 25 mmol/L rH-ferritin. The
conversion to the supercoiled form of DNA was induced by BCNU (right). This effect was inhibited by H-ferritin (left). B, comparison of the effect of
H-ferritin and L-ferritin on DNA. The DNA plasmid pUC19 was treated with 5 mmol/L of BCNU and then exposed to incremental concentrations of
rH-ferritin (left) or L-ferritin (right). The conversion to relaxed and linear forms was observed in the presence of rH-ferritin (left) but not in the presence of
L-ferritin (right). The presence of rH-ferritin was associated with increased relaxed and liner forms (middle). L-ferritin had a minimal effect. rHF, rH-ferritin;

extrusions with different membrane filter sizes resulted in
uniform size, which contributed to a transfection efficiency of
more than 90%. The homogeneous size distribution of the Cliposomes diminished the chance of aggregation, and therefore a lack of observed toxicity, which corresponds with
previous studies (26, 27). Efficacy and toxicity were examined
both in vitro and in vivo. In the past, we have shown that siRNA
delivered through nuclear transfection without C-liposomes
downregulated H-ferritin expression approximately 5-fold in
glioma cells compared with controls (10). This same siRNA
delivered by C-liposomes downregulated H-ferritin expression
by more than 9-fold both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our present
results further indicate that a nanoliposomal delivery mechanism can increase the efficacy of siRNA and optimize the
amount of siRNA delivered.
In addition to showing that H-ferritin siRNA sensitizes
cancer cells to chemotoxins, we addressed the potential
mechanisms by which H-ferritin siRNA may be involved. As

reported previously, H-ferritin was concentrated in the
nuclear fraction containing heterochromatin in SW1088 astrocytoma cells (10). H-ferritin binds to DNA in SW1088 glioma
cells and promotes DNA relaxation, thus functionally it should
be associated with increased transcription (28). We have
previously shown that ferritin releases iron in a controlled
manner to promote DNA relaxation, although, in the higher
concentration range, there is an increase in the linear form of
DNA, which is associated with DNA damage (9, 10). These
previous reports are consistent with the observations in this
study that H-ferritin maintained DNA in a relaxed form even
in the presence of high concentrations of an alkylating agent
and blocking the formation of supercoiled DNA. Thus, the data
presented herein provide a compelling argument for a protective and trophic role of H-ferritin in tumor growth through
a direct effect on DNA.
In contrast, downregulation of H-ferritin was associated
with an increased activation of caspase-3 in U251 and MCF-7

cells. This observation is consistent with reports that downregulation of H-ferritin resulted in an increase in apoptosis of
malignant mesothelioma cells (29) and that overexpression of
H-ferritin inhibited TNF-a–induced apoptosis (30). The induction of caspase-3 upon silencing the H-ferritin in MCF-7 cells
is similar to reports using other anticancer treatments (31, 32).
These observations in vitro supported our hypothesis for the
potential therapeutic value of silencing H-ferritin in these
cells. In addition to the intracellular effects, H-ferritin is
secreted by numerous types of cancer cells (15–19). The effect
of secreted ferritin in cancer may be to limit immunosuppressive responses (33). Thus, targeted siRNA therapy for Hferritin in vivo may have an additive impact on tumor suppression and is an area warranting future exploration.
In conclusion, our study has shown that the vulnerability of
cancer cells to chemotherapy can be increased by limiting Hferritin expression. The importance of ferritin in cancer cell
biology suggests that efficient delivery of siRNA for H-ferritin
could be a viable therapeutic option for sensitizing tumors to
chemotherapy.
