Abstract
Src family kinases (SFK) integrate signal transduction for multiple receptors, regulating cellular proliferation,
invasion, and metastasis in human cancer. Although Src is rarely mutated in human prostate cancer, SFK activity
is increased in the majority of human prostate cancers. To determine the molecular mechanisms governing
prostate cancer bone metastasis, FVB murine prostate epithelium was transduced with oncogenic v-Src. The
prostate cancer cell lines metastasized in FVB mice to brain and bone. Gene expression proﬁling of the tumors
identiﬁed activation of a CCR5 signaling module when the prostate epithelial cell lines were grown in vivo versus
tissue cultures. The whole body, bone, and brain metastatic prostate cancer burden was reduced by oral CCR5
antagonist. Clinical trials of CCR5 inhibitors may warrant consideration in patients with CCR5 activation in their
tumors. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7103–14. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer remains the most common nondermatologic cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of
cancer-related death among men with approximately 190,000
new cases diagnosed and approximately 27,000 deaths annually (1). The molecular mechanisms contributing to prostate
cancer recurrence and therapy resistance are poorly understood. Increased expression of individual Src family kinases
(SFK) has been observed during prostate cancer progression
(2, 3). The SFK members Src and Lyn are highly expressed in the
majority of human prostate cancers and Src kinase can pro-

mote prostate cancer initiation and progression (4). Androgen
ablation therapy results in a 60% to 80% initial response rate
(5). The majority of patients undergoing androgen antagonist
therapy, however, subsequently relapse. Src has been strongly
implicated in promoting androgen-independent growth and
enhances androgen-induced proliferation of prostate cancer
cells (6–8). Early diagnosis may provide an opportunity for
curative surgery; however, approximately 30% of men who
receive radical prostatectomy relapse, attributed to micrometastatic disease.
Prostate cancer is unique among solid tumors in its proclivity to metastasize primarily to bone. Once patients develop
prostate cancer bone metastasis, the number of lesions
increases dramatically, resulting in extensive pain and disability. Bone metastasis are common in many different cancer
types including prostate, breast, lung, and colon, with some
350,000 people dying with metastasis to their bones each year
in the United States (9, 10). The bone metastasis of prostate
cancer is predominantly osteoblastic, although they often
begin as osteolytic lesions (11).
A number of studies have sought to identify molecular
drivers of metastasis based on groundbreaking work by Filder
(12) and Kim and colleagues (13). Metastatic prostate cancer
has a unique predilection for bone with signiﬁcant clinical
consequence. The immune system contributes to the onset,
progression, and metastases of prostate cancer. At this time,
there is a relative paucity of animal models that undergo
reliable metastasis to bone (14, 15). Thus, although transgenic
mice maintain a normal immune response, none of the current
transgenic models undergo reliable bone metastasis.
Analysis of the molecular mechanisms governing bony
metastasis of prostate cancer requires the development of
prostate cancer cell lines that spread reproducibly to bone in

immunocompetent mice. The lack of robust animal models of
bone metastasis has hampered the development of new therapeutics. To address this question, we developed isogenic
oncogene-transduced murine prostate epithelial cancer cell
lines (16). These cell lines reliably formed osteolytic bone
lesions in immunocompetent mice. Gene expression analysis
comparing the cell lines in tissue culture with gene expression
of the tumors in immune competent mice evidenced the
activation of CCR5 signaling axis. Inhibition of the CCR5
signaling module by drug treatment blocked bone and brain
metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfection, transduction, and expression
vectors
The prostate epithelial cells (PEC) were transformed with
the v-Src oncogene, generated in this laboratory (16), were
transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the luc2 and
Tomato Red genes to generate stable bioluminescent cancer
cell lines. [The Luc2-tomato red expression vector (Luc-Tom)
has been described previously (17)]. The isogenic v-Src-PEC
lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and cultured in 5% CO2 at
37 C. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem and was used at
the concentration of 10 mmol/L for 12 hours.
Wound healing assay
Cells were grown to conﬂuence on 12-well plates in DMEM
containing 10% FBS. The monolayers were wounded with a P10
micropipette tip. The cells were washed with PBS immediately
after scoring and serum-free DMEM was added (18). Wound
healing was monitored using an Axiovert 200 Zeiss microscope
system for 20 hours. Video images were collected with a CCD
camera (model 2400) at 20-minute intervals, digitized, and
stored as images using Metamorph software. Images were
converted to QuickTime movies and the position of nuclei
was tracked to quantify cell motility. Cellular velocity was
calculated in micrometers (mm) using Metamorph software.
The movie of cell migration was taken at 20 minutes per frame
for 20 hours using an Axiovert 200 Zeiss microscope system.
Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software.
Tumor formation assay
Male FVB mice, 12-week-old, were anesthetized by exposure
to 3% isoﬂurane. Anesthetized mice received 1  106 cells
suspended in 50 mL of Dulbecco PBS lacking calcium and
magnesium (DPBS) and 50 mL of BD Matrigel Basement
Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences) by subcutaneous injection
at one dorsal ﬂank. The injection was performed using 27.5gauge needle. Tumor progression was followed by measurement of bioluminescence once a week until tumor excision,
using the IVIS LUMINA XR system (Caliper Life Sciences) as
described previously (19). Brieﬂy, for in vivo imaging, mice
received the substrate of luciferase, D-Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology), at 15 mg/mL in PBS by intraperitoneal injection of
10 mL of luciferin stock solution per gram of body weight
(manufacturer's recommendation) and were anesthetized by

7104

exposure to 3% isoﬂurane. At 10 to 15 minutes after D-luciferin
injection, animals were placed inside the camera box of the
IVIS Lumina XR and received continuous exposure to 2.5%
isoﬂurane. Imaging time ranged from 5 minutes (for earlier
time points) to 5 seconds (for later time points), depending on
the bioluminescence of neoplastic lesion. Regions of interest
(ROI) from displayed images were drawn around the tumor
sites or the metastatic lesion and quantiﬁed using the Living
Image 3.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences). Tumor samples
were harvested after 3 weeks. All experiments involving mice
were carried out under the approval of Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Thomas Jefferson
University (Philadelphia, PA).
Experimental metastasis assay
Eight-week-old male FVB mice were anesthetized by exposure to 3% isoﬂurane. A total of 2  105 cancer cells suspended
in 100 mL of DPBS were injected into the left ventricle of the
heart of the mouse. Injections were performed using a 30.5gauge needle and a 1-mL syringe. To conﬁrm the presence of
cells in the systemic circulation, animals were imaged using
IVIS LUMINA XR system as described above. A successful
intracardiac injection was indicated by systemic bioluminescence distributed through the animal body. Mice not properly
injected were removed from the study. Results were analyzed
using Living Image 3.0 software.
Radiographic analysis of bone metastasis and CT
Development of bone metastasis was monitored by X-ray
radiography using the IVIS Lumina XR. Mice were anesthetized, arranged in a prone position, and exposed to an X-ray for
5 minutes.
Administration of maraviroc (antagonist of CCR5)
Male FVB mice received an oral dose of maraviroc (Selleck
Chemicals LLC) of 8 mg/kg every 12 hours from 5 days before
inoculation of cancer cells until euthanasia. The drug was
dissolved in acidiﬁed water containing 5% DMSO. Control mice
were maintained on an identical dosing schedule and received
the same volume of vehicle.
Invasion assay
The three-dimensional invasion assay was performed as
previously reported (20). Brieﬂy, 100 mL of 1.67 mg/mL Rat
Tail Collagen Type I (BD Biosciences) was pipetted into the top
chamber of a 24-well 8-mm pore Transwell (Corning). The
Transwell was incubated at 37 C overnight to allow the
collagen to solidify. Thirty-thousand cells were then seeded
on the bottom of the Transwell membrane and allowed to
attach. Serum-free growth medium was placed into the bottom
chamber, whereas 15 ng/mL CCL5 (R&D Systems), or 10% FBS
was used as a chemoattractant in the medium of the top
chamber. The cells were then chemoattracted across the ﬁlter
through the collagen above for 3 days. Cells were ﬁxed in 4%
formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS, and
then stained with 40 mg/mL propidium iodide for 2 hours.
Fluorescence was analyzed by confocal z-sections (one section
every 20 mm) at 10 magniﬁcation from the bottom of the ﬁlter

using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope at
the Kimmel Cancer Center Bioimaging Facility.
Histologic analysis
Tumor samples and soft tissues were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Fisher Scientiﬁc) and processed for parafﬁn
embedding, sectioning, H&E, and immunohistochemistry
(IHC). Bones were ﬁxed in 4% PFA at 4 C for 72 hours,
decalciﬁed in 0.5 mol/L EDTA (pH 8.0) for 7 days at 4 C, and
embedded in parafﬁn (21). Antibodies for IHC were CK5 (PRB160P, Covance), CK8 (MMS-162P, Covance), KLK3 (Ab44392,
Abcam), and CCR5 (A00979, GenScript) for staining of tumor
sections. CK5 staining was performed after deparafﬁnization
and rehydration without the antigen retrieval treatment on
bone and brain samples to conﬁrm the presence of basal
prostate epithelial cells. CK8 staining needed pretreatment of
slides with a citrate buffer retrieval solution (Biogenex) and
was performed to show the presence of luminal prostate
epithelial cells in bone and brain samples. Tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was performed after deparafﬁnization and rehydration as directed by the manufacturer
(Sigma-Aldrich) to identify active osteoclasts at the surface
between metastatic lesion and compact bone (22, 23). The
tetrachrome method was performed on bones to identify
woven bone in the osteoblastic lesions areas (22, 24).
Cell labeling and FACS analysis
Before labeling, the cells were blocked with normal mouse
IgG in 1/100 dilution for 1 hour and then incubated with APClabeled mouse anti-human/mouse CCR5 (1/10; FAB1208A,
R&D Systems) for another hour. APC-labeled normal mouse
IgG was used as negative control. All experiments were carried
out at 4 C. Cell sorting was performed on FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed with
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Microarray analysis methods
Preprocessing and differential expression analysis.
Microarray data were preprocessed using background correction, and quantile normalization and summarization were
performed on the Mouse Gene 1.0 ST gene expression microarrays using the Robust Multichip Analysis workﬂow in Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.1 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Differentially expressed genes were identiﬁed for the v-Src-PEC
tumor, by performing pairwise comparisons against the normal mouse prostate or v-Src-PEC cell culture. These comparisons were performed using signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays (SAM) with a false discovery rate cutoff of 1% and 2-fold
change cutoff.
PET imaging
Animal imaging was performed according to the IACUC.
Flourine-18, sodium ﬂuoride (F-18-NaF) in isotonic solution
was obtained from IBA Molecular. A total of 210  9.54 mCi of F18-NaF in 150 mL was injected through the lateral tail vein of
unanesthetized mice. One hour later, animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoﬂurane in 98.5% O2 and imaged with the
Inveon microPET scanner (Siemens Hoffman estate), a high

spatial resolution (1 mm in full-width at half maximum) and
sensitivity (>10%) position emission scanning (PET) scanner.
On average, 1.5 million counts were obtained in 10 minutes of
imaging. An ordered subset expectation maximization 3dimensional algorithm with 5 iterations and 8 subsets was
used for demonstration.
X-ray imaging
The images were acquired using CareStream Molecular
Imaging FX-Pro scanner. Image capture setting was set to
X-ray imaging performed at an energy of 35 KVP and an X-ray
current of 150 mA with a total acquisition time of 60 seconds.
The radio phosphor screen was positioned in the imaging ﬁeld.
The exposure type was set to Standard with X/Y binning set to
none to increase image resolution. Emission and Excitation
ﬁlters were both set to zero. FOV was set to 120.0 mm with an fstop of 2.80 and a focal plane of 7.6 mm. During imaging, each
mouse was anesthetized by inhalation of 1.5% isoﬂuorane and
98.5% O2. The bright ﬁeld images were captured and digitized.
Optical density analysis
CareStream molecular Imaging FX-Pro software allows
optical density (OD) to be measured by using the amount of
light that passes through an object to determine the amount of
matter within an ROI. Optical density was performed on both
tibias of each of the treated (3) and untreated (3) mice with 6
ROIs drawn on each tibia. The total tibia mean OD of each
mouse was then tabulated for each mouse and the OD was
compared between the treated and untreated mice.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons between groups were analyzed by two-sided t
test. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant. All analyses were done with SPSS 11.5 software.
Data are expressed as mean  SEM.

Results
V-Src prostate cancer tumor growth in
immunocompetent mice
The v-Src prostate cancer cell lines derived by transduction
of murine prostate epithelial cells with retroviruses encoding
oncogenic v-Src and Luc2-Tomato were assessed for invasive
and growth properties. The v-Src-PECs were assessed for
migration in wound-healing assays. Comparison was made
with the parental nontransformed PEC. The velocity of the cell
moving to wound strip was measured quantitatively for 12
hours. The velocity of migration was increased 73.3% from 0.57
 0.06 mm/minute to 0.99  0.12 mm/minute (Fig. 1A and B).
The v-Src PEC cells also conveyed the ability to invade Matrigel,
whereas the parental PECs were unable to invade (Fig. 1C).
The v-Src-PEC grew as subcutaneous tumors in immunocompetent FVB mice. The relative abundance of several proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry with comparison made to sections of normal prostate from FVB mice.
Androgen receptor (AR) abundance was reduced (Fig. 2B).
Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors identiﬁed the
presence of cytokeratins CK5 and CK8 (Fig. 2C and D). CK5 is a

was increased, whereas CK8 was reduced (Supplementary Fig.
S1). The tumors expressed the androgen-responsive KLK3
(glandular kallikrein-related peptidase 3), consistent with
expression of AR by this line in tissue culture (16). Quantitation
of AR mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
demonstrated a relative reduction in AR mRNA levels compared with primary prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 2F). Western
blot analysis of the v-Src lines in tissue culture demonstrated a
reduction in AR and CK8 but an increase in CK5 abundance
compared with the parental PEC when normalized to the
loading control vinculin (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Immunostaining of individual v-Src PEC demonstrated the cells consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of both CK5- and CK8stained cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Upon introduction of the v-Src-PEC line into the arterial
circulation via intracardiac injection, tumors developed in
multiple organs within two weeks of injection (Fig. 3). Photonic
emission evidenced metastasis to the brain, bones, kidney and

the mice was determined as 100%. The relative tumor burden
for each organ was consistent for each of the mice injected
with the v-Src-PEC cell lines (Fig. 3E). One hundred percent of
the v-Src-PEC–injected mice developed bony metastasis. The
bony photon ﬂux was dramatically enhanced in the v-Src-PEC
tumors, with total photon ﬂux (5  107) (Fig. 3D).
v-Src–induced prostate tumor metastasis maintain the
histologic features of the primary prostate tumors
We characterized the bone metastasis of the v-Src-PEC lines.
In view of the importance of generating a model of prostate
cancer metastasis that reﬂects human disease, we conducted
complementary approaches to analysis of the bone lesions. Xray of the bones at day 14 demonstrated the presence of
radiolucent lesions in the tibia (Fig. 4A); femur, spine, and
skull. The bony metastasis of the mice were osteolytic in nature
by X-ray (Fig. 4A). The lesions were found primarily at the
epiphyseal junction as osteolytic lesions at two weeks (Fig. 4E).
The X-ray rendered images were next characterized by surface
rendering (Fig. 4B) and by CT scan (Fig. 4B). Each of these
imaging techniques conﬁrmed the presence of bone lesions.

further histological conﬁrmation was conducted of the bony
metastasis. Histological analysis of the osteolytic bone lesions
of the prostate tumors evidenced adenocarcinoma resembling

identiﬁed the histological features of the metastatic tumor as
similar to the primary adenocarcinoma (Fig. 4D), and the

ly enriched (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Within these GO terms,
components of the CCR5 signaling pathway were signiﬁcantly
upregulated by v-Src (Fig. 5B). In order to determine which
pathways were regulated by tumor growth in vivo, comparison
was made between the v-Src–transformed lines grown in tissue
culture, with the v-Src-transformed PEC growth in immune
competent FVB mice. GO term analysis of multiplicate independent cell lines demonstrated again enrichment of the
cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction GO term and the chemokine signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Microarray comparison demonstrated increased expression of speciﬁc cytokine receptors and their ligands including CCR7,
CCR5, CCRl, CCL8, CCL7, CCL2 and CCL1 (Fig. 5C). The relative
changes in gene expression are shown colorimetrically (Fig. 5C,
Supplementary Fig. S5B) or quantitatively (Fig. 5D). CCR5
serves as a receptor for several ligands including CCL5, CCL8
and CCL7 (Fig. 5E). The increased expression of CCR5 (11.3fold), CCL7 (5.2-fold) and CCL8 (8.6-fold) may be expected to
enhance signaling by this receptor. Interrogation of Oncomine data for human prostate cancer demonstrated a moderate but signiﬁcant increase in CCR5 abundance in patient
lymph node and bone metastasis (Fig. 5F). Increased CCR5
expression was also observed in human prostate cancer
compared with benign disease and in metastatic compared

with primary disease in other public databases (Supplementary Fig. S7A–C). A gene signature that included CCR5,
generated from the chemokine signaling pathway to include
genes upregulated in both in vivo tumor versus in vitro cell
culture and in v-Src-PEC tumor versus in normal prostate,
was highly correlated with recurrence-free survival probability of patients in both the Glinsky and Tailor data sets
(Supplementary Fig. S7D–G). FACS analysis of the v-Src-PEC
demonstrated that 25.4% of the cells expressed CCR5 protein
on the cell surface (Fig. 5G). In view of the CCR5 receptor
activation in the v-Src-PEC and recent studies demonstrating CCR5 promotes invasion and metastasis of basal
breast cancer cell lines in immune-deﬁcient mice (26), we
examined the role of CCR5 in v-Src-PEC cellular invasion.
Matrigel invasion by the v-Src-PEC was abolished by the
CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc (Fig. 5H). The v-Src-PEC line
was injected into FVB mice and animals were treated with
either oral maraviroc or control for 2 weeks. Representative
examples of the mice are shown in Fig. 5I. The total body
metastasis tumor burden was reduced by >60% upon Maraviroc treatment (Fig. 5J). Immunohistochemical staining
identiﬁed the presence of CCR5 within the bone metastasis
that was identiﬁed by histology as adenocarcinoma (Fig. 5K).
To determine the mechanism by which v-Src induces CCR5
abundance, qRT-PCR was conducted for CCR5 mRNA levels
comparing the v-Src-PEC tumors with the normal prostate
tissues (Supplementary Data 6). The CCR5 mRNA levels were
increased 4- to 5-fold in v-Src-PEC tumors. To determine
whether v-Src contributes to CCR5 protein stability, cells were
treated with proteasome inhibitors for 12 hours and the
relative amount of CCR5þ cells assessed by FACS (Supplementary Fig. S8). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 enhanced the
proportion of CCR5 positive cells approximately 6-fold (Sup-

proportion of CCR5 positive cells by 50%, consistent with the
role of Src kinase in the enhancement of CCR5 abundance in
the presence of proteasome inhibitor.
The CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc reduces v-Src prostate
tumor bone metastasis in immunocompetent mice
In view of the ﬁndings that the metastatic bone tumors
expressed CCR5, we examined the effect of CCR5 inhibition
on the bone metastasis burden. Radiologic imaging evidenced tibial periphyseal metastasis of control animals (Fig.
6A). The animals treated with maraviroc for the same time
period demonstrated a reduction in the tibial periphyseal
osteolucent lesions. For quantiﬁcation of total body bone
burden, the bone photon ﬂux was quantitated after 2 weeks
for N ¼ 10 animals (Fig. 6B) and demonstrated an approximately 80% reduction in bone metastatic burden. Representative examples of the control (Fig. 6C–G) or maraviroc-treated

The CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc reduces v-Src prostate
brain metastasis in immunocompetent mice
We next determined the effect of CCR5 inhibition on the
v-Src-PEC brain metastasis. Histologic analysis demonstrated the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma by H&E staining (Fig. 7A). The brain metastasis was immunopositive for
CK5, CK8, and KLK3 (Fig. 7A–D). Oral maraviroc administration reduced the brain metastasis burden with a representative example shown in Fig. 7E. Quantitative analysis for
N ¼ 10 animals demonstrated a >60% reduction in tumor
burden (Fig. 7F and G).

Discussion
The current studies provide several lines of evidence that vSrc oncogene transformation of prostate epithelium induces
metastatic prostate cancer cells associated with increased
expression of CCR5 signaling activity. Comparison of nontransformed and v-Src-PEC demonstrated v-Src induces

expression of both the receptor and ligands that contribute
to activation of CCR5 signaling. Further enhancement of CCR5
signaling components was demonstrated in tumors grown in
immunocompetent mice. IHC demonstrated the presence of
CCR5 in the v-Src-PEC bone metastasis. Treatment with the
CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc reduced tumor metastasis size.

Together, these ﬁndings strongly suggest the CCR5 pathway is
activated in v-Src-PEC in vitro and in vivo.
The current studies demonstrate the development of a
murine model that recapitulates human prostate cancer in
several important ways. First, the current studies deployed, vSrc-PEC, which activated SFK, as observed in the majority of
patients with prostate cancer. Second, the tumor histology
reﬂects human prostate adenocarcinoma. Third, the current
metastatic prostate cancer model was developed in immunocompetent mice. The immune system contributes to the onset
and progression of human prostate cancer metastasis and the
v-Src-PEC metastasized in immunocompetent FVB mice.
Fourth, the gene expression proﬁle is enriched in a subset of
patients with prostate cancer (16). Together, these ﬁndings
suggest this model may be a useful complement to the currently available preclinical models of prostate cancer.

CCR5

The understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing
prostate cancer metastasis and the development of prostate
cancer metastasis therapies has been limited by the lack of
preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate human diseases
(15). Transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer either fail to
develop bone metastasis (27–29) or have such low penetrance
of metastasis, therefore the impact of treatment cannot be
effectively ascertained (28). Several laboratories have focused
on metastatic sublines of tumor cells developed through in vivo
selection or clonal expansion comparing expression proﬁles of
highly and nonmetastatic counter parts from isogenic backgrounds. One recent report of the RM1 cell line developed from
murine urogenital sinus tumors implanted onto the kidney
capsule developed metastasis after intracardiac injection
with high frequency in derivative RM1 (BM) (22). Additional
studies have looked at metastasis-promoting and metastasis-

suppressing genes (30). Speciﬁc subsets of genes have been
identiﬁed that mediate breast cancer metastasis to bone
(31–36).
The current studies demonstrate that oncogenic Src induces
CCR5 signaling in prostate epithelial cells. CCR5 has been
shown to promote breast cancer metastasis via a homing
mechanism (26). Src has been implicated in activation of the
AKT survival pathway, and Src is required for CXCLR activation in metastatic breast cancer cells (13). These ﬁndings may
have useful clinical implications. SFKs have been considered as
potential drug targets in human prostate cancer. Src inhibitors
reduce prostate cancer growth in mouse xenograft studies (37)
and in regenerative prostate grafts (6). In prior studies using a
model of c-Src and AR-transduced prostate epithelial cells with
transplantation under the kidney capsule in immunodeﬁcient
(SCID) mice, dasatinib reduced tumor graft weight (6). Dasatinib, saracatinib, and basutinib are three SFK inhibitors that

exhibit clinical efﬁcacy. Toxicity, however, includes reduced
renal tubular secretion of creatinine and centrosomal and
mitotic spindle defects in normal cells and cardiac toxicity
(38–40). Severe adverse clinical symptoms include renal failure,
fatigue leniency, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea (41). Src
activates distinct signaling modules. The ability to identify a
tractable Src-dependent module that contributes to tumor
metastasis, governing CCR5 signaling as shown herein, presents a rational alternative therapeutic approach.
The relevance of the current studies is supported ﬁrst by
interrogation of human prostate cancer samples demonstrating increased expression of CCR5 in bone metastasis compared
with the primary tumor. Second, in recent studies, an algorithm was developed that distinguished good and poor prognosis of patients with prostate cancer (16). Components of
the chemokine signaling pathway, including CCR5, were signiﬁcantly enriched in the poor prognosis signature group

(Supplementary Fig. SS7D–S7G). This ﬁnding raises the possibility that activation of CCR5 signaling can contribute to the
poor outcome in this subset of patients.
What might be the clinical implications of the current
preclinical studies? The prognosis for men with metastatic
prostate cancer is on average 30 to 35 months. Radiation
treatment for local sites and radiopharmaceuticals, such as
strontium-89, samarium-153, and rhenium-188-HEDP, has
demonstrated improvements in palliation. Herein oral administration of the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, an FDA-approved
compound used for treatment of HIV deployed at similar dose
as that used in the clinic, reduced the metastatic burden by
approximately 80% and metastatic bone burden by >60%. Given
the relative enrichment of CCR5 signaling in patients with poor
prognosis prostate cancer and the preclinical efﬁcacy of CCR5

inhibitors herein, the current studies of CCR5 inhibitors suggest
clinical trials may be warranted in human prostate cancer
