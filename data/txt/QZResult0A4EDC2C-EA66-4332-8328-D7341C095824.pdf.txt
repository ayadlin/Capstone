BACKGROUND: In neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancers, complete tumor regression has been difficult to achieve, and tumor often remained after chemotherapy. However, the best
method for evaluating the response to chemotherapy based on histopathologic examination of residual
tumors has not been established. METHODS: Studied were 74 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and doxorubicin), followed by surgery for advanced esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma. The correlation between various histopathologic factors and clinical response with survival
was examined, including the importance of tumor budding in the invasive front of tumors on clinical
response and survival. RESULTS: Among 74 patients, 3 achieved a pathologic complete response, and 29
(41%) of 71 residual tumors demonstrated high-grade budding in the invasive front. The 5-year survival rate
of patients with low-grade budding tumors was 49%, compared with 17% for those with high-grade budding (P < .001). Budding correlated inversely with good response, which was observed in 44 (60%) of 74
patients. Univariate analysis showed that pathologic tumor depth, number of lymph node metastases, pathologic stage, lymphatic invasion, budding and clinical response were significant prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis identified budding as the most important prognostic factor followed by number of lymph
node metastases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated that tumor budding in the
invasive front of tumors correlated significantly with clinical response and prognosis of patients with
esophageal squamous cell carcinomas who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, the mechanism

Tumor Budding in Esophageal Cancers/Miyata et al

Esophagectomy is the standard treatment for
resectable esophageal cancers. However, after curative tumor resection, systemic and local recurrences are still common and the 5-year survival rate ranges from 15% to
39%.1,2 To improve prognosis, combination therapy of
preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy have been developed. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery is 1 of the most promising
strategies for advanced esophageal cancers, and several
studies have reported survival advantages of this trimodality therapy compared with surgery alone.3-5 Another
potential combination therapy is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, and several studies have reported
encouraging results of preoperative chemotherapy
followed by surgery.6-8 The reported response rate to
preoperative chemotherapy for esophageal cancers
ranges from 31% to 57%. However, it appears that preoperative chemotherapy increases the rate of curative resection without increasing morbidity and mortality after
surgery.6,7,9-11
Evaluation of the response to neoadjuvant therapy
includes radiologic imaging and histopathologic examination of surgical specimens. In neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, radiation-induced fibrotic or inflammatory
changes make it difficult to objectively assess the amount
of residual tumor area by conventional radiologic imaging.12,13 Therefore, evaluation of tumor response to
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy commonly includes histopathologic assessment of tumor regression using
resected specimens.14-17 In such an analysis, the percentage of residual carcinoma relative to the total tumor area is
estimated and graded.
In the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there
are certain problems in histopathologic examination of
the resected specimens. First, complete tumor regression
is less often observed in neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy.6,8-10 Second, it is difficult
to assess the initial tumor area by histopathologic examination of resected specimens because of chemotherapyinduced fibrotic changes in the tumor and surrounding
tissues is not notable.18 Thus, in neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas clinical response by radiologic imaging is
regarded as a useful prognostic method, pathologic factors
that are associated with tumor response and survival have
not been fully elucidated. Therefore, in the present study,
we investigated objective and reproducible histopathoCancer

logic factors that reflect clinical outcome, including tumor
response to chemotherapy and prognosis. The results
identified ‘tumor budding’ in the invasive front of residual
cancers after chemotherapy as an independent prognostic
factor, which is also associated with tumor response to
chemotherapy. The mechanism of budding and treatment
strategy based on estimation of budding are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
From April 2000 to December 2005, 262 patients with
thoracic esophageal cancers underwent surgery at The
Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate
School of Medicine, Osaka University. Among them, 74
patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus who underwent preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery were enrolled
in the present study. All patients were newly diagnosed
and had no prior treatment. Basically, during this period,
preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery was
selected for patients with any tumor depth (cT1-4) and
lymph node involvement, including regional lymph node
(N1) and distant lymph node (M1 lym) without distant
organ metastasis. All patients were younger than 80 years
of age; had adequate cardiac, hepatic, renal, and bone
marrow reserve; and could tolerate both the planned
chemotherapy and the following surgical procedures.
In this study, all patients were staged pre- and postoperatively according to the criteria of the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC). Pretreatment clinical
staging was based on endoscopy; computed tomography
(CT) scans of the neck, chest, and the upper abdomen as
continuous 5-mm-thick slices; and positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Lymph nodes were diagnosed as
metastasis-positive on CT scan if they were greater than
1.0 cm in maximum transverse dimension. Lymph nodes
visible but smaller than 1.0 cm on the long axis on CT
scan were regarded as metastasis-positive only if focal
prominent 18-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) uptake, compared with normal mediastinal activity, was detected on
the PET scan. The study protocol was approved by the
Human Ethics Review Committee of Osaka University
School of Medicine.

Treatment Regimen and Evaluation
of Response to Chemotherapy
Preoperative chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cisplatin was administered at at a dose of 70 mg/m2, doxorubicin at a dose
of 35 mg/m2 by rapid intravenous infusion on Day 1, and
5-FU at a dose of 700 mg/m2 administered by continuous
intravenous infusion on Day 1 through Day 7. Two
courses of chemotherapy were used, separated by a 4-week
interval. Of the 74 patients, 72 completed the 2 courses of
preoperative chemotherapy, whereas the remaining 2
completed only 1 course because their tumor did not
show any sign of significant regression. All patients underwent surgery 3 to 5 weeks after completion of preoperative
chemotherapy. With regard to the extent of surgery, 72
patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with 2or 3-field lymphadenectomy and 2 patients underwent
esophagectomy through the transhiatal approach. Complete tumor resection (R0) was performed in 72 patients,
whereas 2 patients had incomplete tumor resection with
microscopic (R1) or macroscopic residual tumors (R2).
Two weeks after completion of chemotherapy, all
patients were re-staged by endoscopy, CT scan, and PET
scan to evaluate the clinical response to chemotherapy.
The clinical response was categorized according to the following criteria, which were based on the World Health
Organization response criteria for measurable disease and
the criteria of the Japanese Society for Esophageal Diseases.19 A complete response (CR) was defined as clinical
complete regression of the disease. A CR of the primary
tumors was determined when the tumors disappeared on
CT scan and/or PET scan and endoscopy. If further ulceration and presence of cancer cells in biopsy samples was
confirmed by endoscopy, the case was excluded from CR.
A partial response (PR) was defined as >50% reduction
in primary tumor size and lymph node metastasis, as confirmed by CT scan. Progressive disease (PD) was defined
as >25% increase in the primary tumor or the appearance
of new lesions. Cases that did not meet the criteria of PR
or PD were defined as no change (NC).
Histopathologic Examination
After fixation in 10% buffered formalin, entire surgical
specimens were cut into 5-mm slices parallel to the long
axis. All sliced tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut
3326

into 4 lm-thick sections. These thin sections of the primary tumors and lymph nodes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using routine methods, and all the
sections were examined microscopically. All specimens
were examined independently by 2 observers (H.M. and
A.Y.) who were blinded to patient outcome and other
clinical findings, and 1 pathologist (M.M.) confirmed
their diagnosis. In case of a disagreement regarding a tumor grading, observers and the pathologist reviewed slides
together and reached a consensus diagnosis. The histopathologic findings were classified according to the UICC
TNM classification. The degree of histopathologic tumor
regression in surgical specimens was classified into 5 categories. The extent of viable residual carcinoma at the primary site was assessed semiquantitatively, based on the
estimated percentage of viable residual carcinoma in relation to the macroscopically identifiable tumor bed that
was evaluated histologically. This percentage of viable residual tumor cells within the total cancerous tissue was
assessed as follows: Grade 3, no viable residual tumor
cells; Grade 2, less than 1 of 3 residual tumor cells; Grade
1b, 1 of 3 to 2 of 3 residual tumor cells; Grade 1a, more
than 2 of 3 residual tumor cells; Grade 0, no significant
response to chemotherapy.8,19 The extent of residual carcinoma in regional lymph nodes was not assessed.
Therapy-induced changes included reactive change
such as necrosis, fibrosis, foamy histiocytes, mucosal
edema, vascular changes in the tumor periphery, and giant
cell reactions. When present, these characteristics were
considered to be signs of neoplastic regression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.12,13,15-18
Lymphatic invasion was classified as weak (none or
1 to 3 involved lymphatic vessels per low-power microscopic field [LPF]), or strong (>3 involved vessels per
LPF).
Tumor budding was defined as isolated single cancer
cells or a cluster of fewer than 5 cancer cells.20-22 These
scattered foci were observed in the stroma of the actively
invasive front of residual cancer cells after preoperative
chemotherapy (Fig. 1). After selecting a field in which
scattering intensity was considered maximal, the number
of scattered foci was counted in the field using the 20
objective lens. Tumor budding was classified as low grade
(<5 scattering formations/field) or high grade (5 scattering formations/field).20,23,24 To determine cell viability, we used immunostaining for Ki-67 based on the

entered prospectively into a database, and updated at regular intervals. The median follow-up period of all 74
patients was 55.7 months (range, 22.1-105.8 months).
Complete follow-up information until death or April
2008 was available for all patients.
Statistical Analysis
The baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were
compared using the chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U
test. Overall survival was calculated from the date of operation to the occurrence of the event or to the last known
date of follow-up. Actual survival was calculated by the
Kaplan-Meyer test and statistically evaluated by the logrank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model
was used to analyze the simultaneous influence of prognostic factors. In all analyses, a P < .05 was accepted as
statistically significant. These analyses were performed
using the StatView J5.0 software package (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, Calif).

Follow-up Study
After hospital discharge, patients were seen every 2
months for the first 2 years, and every 3 months thereafter.
CT scan of the neck, thorax, and upper abdomen was performed every 4 months for the first 2 years and every 6
months thereafter. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was
performed annually. Recurrence was confirmed by CT
scan and, if necessary, PET scan. All data were collected,

Table 1 summarizes the pretreatment characteristics of all
74 patients enrolled in this study. Of the 74 patients, 72
received preoperative chemotherapy for lymph node metastasis at initial diagnosis. In the remaining 2, preoperative chemotherapy was provided with the aim of
downstaging of T4 tumors, although they had no lymph
node involvement. With regard to clinical response to preoperative chemotherapy, CR was achieved in 3 patients
and PR in 44 patients, whereas the remaining 27 were
considered NC. The 47 patients who achieved CR or PR
were grouped as responders, whereas the 27 in the NC
group were considered nonresponders. The overall
response rate was 63.5%. The 5-year survival rate was
49% in responders and 17% in nonresponders (Fig. 2).
Thus, the response to chemotherapy was associated with a
significant improvement in survival (P ¼ .001).

and Histopathologic Factors

in 71 patients, excluding the 3 patients whose tumors
demonstrated pathologic CR (Grade 3) (Table 2). There
were no relations noted between clinical response and histopathologically confirmed lymph node metastasis and
pathologic stage, but there was a significant relation
between the response and pathologic tumor depth. Blood
and lymphatic vessel invasion was less common in responders than nonresponders, although statistical analysis
showed the difference to be significant only for blood vessel invasion. However, the pathologic response did not
correlate with the clinical response. High-grade budding
in the invasion front was significantly less common in responders (11 [25.0%] of the 44 resected tumors) than in
nonresponders (18 [66.7%] of the 27 tumors; P ¼ .001).

Clinicopathologic Factors Affecting
Long-term Survival
In 71 patients who did not achieve pathologic CR, univariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated that clini3328

cal response was associated with improved survival,
although pathologic response did not affect patient survival (Table 3). Pathologic tumor depth, number of
lymph nodes positive for metastasis, pathologic stage, and
lymphatic invasion were also significant factors that influenced disease-free and overall survival. In addition to these
histopathologic factors, univariate analysis indicated that
the budding pattern noted in the invasion front was a significant prognostic factor; the 5-year overall survival rate
was 58% in patients with low-grade scattering tumors and
17% in those with high-grade budding tumors (P < .001)
(Fig. 3). Multivariate analysis using the above 6 parameters showed that the budding pattern and number of
lymph nodes positive for metastasis were the only 2 independent prognostic factors and identified budding pattern
as the most important prognostic factor, before the number of lymph node metastases (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Recently, multimodal treatment such as neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery have become the mainstream treatment strategy for
patients with locally advanced esophageal cancers, and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy has a large impact
on patient prognosis. In this study, clinical response
assessed by CT scan, but not pathologic response using
tumor regression grading, was found to influence the

result is in agreement with those of previous studies of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancers, which
demonstrated a better survival of clinical responders, as
assessed by conventional radiologic imaging, than nonresponders.4-9 Clinical assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy by conventional radiologic imaging such as

imaging.26,27 Moreover, 1 recent study demonstrated that
early changes in FDG uptake during chemotherapy significantly correlates with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and prognosis.28 Thus, clinical evaluation of
tumor response, using FDG-PET in addition to conventional CT scan, may be more useful for predicting patient
prognosis than conventional radiologic imaging alone.
In the current study, clinical response of the primary
tumor to chemotherapy correlated inversely with pathologic tumor depth of resected specimens, but not with the
pathologic lymph node status. The reason for this observation is that the pathologic status of lymph nodes after
treatment is most likely affected not only by tumor
response to chemotherapy but also by the pretreatment
3330

status of the lymph node. In fact, our previous study
showed that both the number of PET-positive lymph
nodes before treatment and PET-assessed response of the
primary tumor were independent prognostic factors in
esophageal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy followed by surgery.29 However, in this
study, when clinical response was evaluated by SUVmax
reduction, there was a significant correlation between
pathologic lymph node status and clinical response based
on PET findings. Taken together, FDG-PET may be
superior to CT for evaluating the response of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell
carcinomas.29 Another possible explanation is that there
may be some differences in response to chemotherapy

between lymph node metastasis and the primary tumors.
Several studies using DNA microarray methods demonstrated that gene expression profiling of metastatic
tumors, including lymph node metastases, was quite distinct from that of the primary tumors in several types of
cancers such as breast cancers and prostate cancers.30,31
One recent study of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
showed that genetic aberrations in single disseminated tumor cells from lymph node and bone marrow, but not in
primary tumors, are associated with unfavorable prognosis.32 Considered together, these results suggest that it is
inaccurate to use the primary tumor as a surrogate marker
for response to therapy and prognosis; rather, it may be
Cancer

necessary to include disseminated tumors as well as primary tumors as surrogate markers.
Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of
lymph nodes positive for metastasis and the budding pattern of the invasion front, but not clinical response of the
primary tumor, were significant prognostic factors in
squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Because local
disease control is the main goal of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the response of the primary tumor is usually
closely correlated with prognosis of patients.10,11,13-15
Conversely, the main aim of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
is to control systemic micrometastasis. This may explain
why clinical response of the primary tumor was not an independent prognostic factor in this study. The result that
budding was a significant prognostic factor in multivariate
analysis indicates that this pattern may be significantly
associated with systemic micrometastasis.
Involvement of lymphatic vessels and the number of
metastatic lymph nodes are both significant prognostic
factors in patients with esophageal cancers who receive
surgery alone.33-35 In the current study, univariate analysis
revealed that these 2 factors significantly correlated with
prognosis of patients in the setting of preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery. In a previous study of gastric
3331

Original Article

cancers treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it was
demonstrated that lymphatic vessel invasion, pathologic
tumor depth, pathologic lymph node status, and tumor
regression grade correlated significantly with survival, but
lymphatic invasion was found to be a better predictor of
prognosis than pathologic tumor depth and tumor regression grade of the primary tumor.18 Moreover, multivariate analysis in the present study revealed that the number
of lymph node metastases was an independent prognostic
factor, although pathologic tumor depth of the primary
tumor was not. Thus, the control of lymph node metastasis including lymphatic vessel invasion is more significant
in preoperative chemotherapy than downstaging of the
primary tumor, although both are the main purposes of
preoperative chemotherapy for advanced esophageal
cancers.
Ki-67 is a cell cycle marker that is frequently evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting for its potential role as a
predictor or surrogate marker for response to such therapy. In esophageal cancers, it is reported that a pretreatment high Ki-67 index was significantly correlated with
good response and prolonged survival of patients treated
with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery.36,37 In breast cancers, previous studies reported that
reduction in the Ki-67 index during neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly predicted the clinical response and
was associated with better survival. In another study, a low
Ki-67 proliferation index after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
was the only significant predictor of better survival.38-40
However, in the present study, the post-treatment Ki-67
index did not correlate with clinical response or prognosis
of patients. This result indicates that the Ki-67 proliferation index is not a useful surrogate marker in the setting of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancers.

described in this study has been investigated especially in
colorectal adenocarcinomas.20-22 Previous studies of colorectal cancers have demonstrated that the presence of budding correlated significantly with a higher rate of lymph
node metastasis and poor prognosis of patients.20-22
Moreover, a recent study of esophageal cancers also
showed that tumor budding is a significant prognostic factor for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
who underwent surgery alone.24 However, to our knowledge, the mechanisms of budding formation or scattering
in the invasive front of tumors are not clear at present. A

recent study by Prall and Ostward41 demonstrated a close
relationship between budding formation and K-ras gene
mutations, which are considered important for epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in sporadic colorectal carcinomas. They suggested that budding formation represents the EMT of cancer cells, which is characterized by
loss of differentiation in epithelial cells. Conversely, several recent in vitro studies demonstrated that bone marrow-derived cells such as mesenchymal stem cells and
immature myeloid cells, which are recruited to the tumor
invasion front through chemokine signaling, promote tumor invasion and metastasis.42-44 Tumor budding in the
current study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancers may represent cross-interaction between bone
marrow-derived cells and cancer cells in the invasive front.
If bone marrow-derived cells recruited to tumor cells
during preoperative chemotherapy contribute to tumor
aggressiveness, cellular and molecular targeting of bone
marrow-derived cell recruitment could be therapeutically
useful in the setting of preoperative chemotherapy.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated that high-grade tumor budding in the invasion
front is the most important predictor of poor prognosis of
patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery;
the second most important predictor appeared to be the
number of lymph node metastases. These results suggest
that estimation of budding after neoadjuvant chemotherapy could provide useful information to select those
patients who might benefit from additional therapy such
as second-line chemotherapy. Further studies are required
to determine the mechanism of tumor budding in the
invasion front of tumors in neoadjuvant chemotherapy
for esophageal cancers.
