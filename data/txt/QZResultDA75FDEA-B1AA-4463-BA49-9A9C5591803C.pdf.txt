ABSTRACT
High doses of the organic nitrate glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), a nitric oxide (NO)
donor, are known to trigger apoptosis in human cancer cells. Here, we show that such
a cytotoxic effect can be obtained with subtoxic concentrations of GTN when combined
with H89, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide.2HCl.
This synergistic effect requires the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from
H89 and NO from GTN treatment that causes cGMP production and PKG activation.
Furthermore, the GTN/H89 synergy was attenuated by inhibition of P2-purinergic
receptors with suramin and competition with ATP/UDP. By down-regulating genes
with antisense oligonucleotides, P2-purinergic receptors P2X3, P2Y1, and P2Y6 were
found to have a role in creating this cytotoxic effect. Thus, H89 likely acts as an ATP
mimetic synergizing with GTN to trigger apoptosis in aggressive cancer cells.

[6, 7]. We previously showed that higher concentrations
of GTN (in the micromolar range) were required to induce
caspase-mediated apoptosis of colon cancer cells and to
sensitize these cells to Fas/CD95 ligand-mediated cell
death [8]. Compared to other NO releasing compounds,
GTN has a specific mode of action, i.e. it produces NO
through biotransformation to nitrite by mitochondrial
aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (mtALDH) [9]. In colon cancer
cells, NO-mediated apoptosis involves the activation of
soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and the production of
cyclic GMP (cGMP), a potent protein kinase G (PKG)
activator [10].
In the present study, we searched a strategy to
decrease the dose at which GTN promotes apoptosis of
cancer cells. We identified isoquinolinesulfonamide H89
(N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino) ethyl]-5-isoquinoline
sulfonamide.2HCl) as a drug that synergizes with nontoxic concentrations of GTN. Surprisingly, this sensitizing
effect of H89, which is mainly known as a protein kinase
inhibitor, does not depend on kinase inhibition. We show
that H89 interacts with P2 receptors and induces the

INTRODUCTION
In the last ten years, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) has
emerged as a potential new approach in cancer therapy.
GTN is an organic nitrate compound [1] that is largely
used to treat angina pectoris, congestive heart failure
and acute myocardial infarction via the release of nitric
oxide (NO) or related species [2]. In a phase II clinical
trial, GTN improved the response rate to chemotherapy
and increased the time to progression in patients with
inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer [3]. Another phase
II trial suggested that low doses of GTN could prevent
prostate cancer progression after primary treatment failure
[4]. Several ongoing clinical trials further explore the
potential interest of using GTN in combination with other
therapies in various cancer types (clinicaltrial.gouv).
In preclinical studies, low concentrations of GTN
(in the nanomolar range) were shown to prevent hypoxiainduced tumor cell evasion from immune cell surveillance
[5] and to revert the chemoresistance of various types of
cancer, including breast, melanoma and prostate cancers

production of reactive oxygen species that, combined with
the NO generated by GTN, further activate the cGMP/
PKG pathway and induce caspase-dependent cell death.

Protein kinase inhibitors structurally related to H89
(H7, H8 and H9) were tested at concentrations of up to
100 μM but they did not produce a similar synergy with
GTN (Figure 1D). H89 did not sensitize SW480 cells
to any other NO donor tested at concentrations up to
100 μM, including sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitrosoN-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and molsidomine exept
isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) which, at high concentration
(100 μM) exhibited a modest synergistic effect when it
was combined with H89 (Figure 1E). Also, H89 did not
sensitize SW480 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs including
5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU, 5 μg/mL), cisplatin (CDDP, 5 μg/
mL) and etoposide (VP16, 50 μM) (Figure 1F). Altogether,
H89 appears to specifically synergize with GTN.

RESULTS
GTN synergizes with the kinase inhibitor H89 to
induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells
To determine whether inhibition of a cellular
signalling pathway could sensitize cancer cells to GTN,
we initially selected inhibitors of phosphatidyl inositide-3kinase (Pi3K), Protein kinase C (PKC), and Protein kinase
A (PKA) and tested their ability to induce apoptosis in
cell lines exposed to non-toxic concentrations of GTN.
Whereas the Pi3K inhibitor wortmannin, and the PKC
inhibitor calphostin C did not demonstrate any significant
effect, H89, an isoquinoline sulfonamide commonly used
as a selective inhibitor of PKA, synergized with GTN in
inducing apoptosis in 40% of SW480 colon cancer cells.
More specifically, a non cytotoxic concentration of GTN
(10 μM) combined with 10 μM H89 for 48 h induced
apoptosis in more than 40% of SW480 cells compared
to less than 10% in the control, with GTN alone, with
H89 alone or with other GTN/inhibitor combinations,
respectively (Figure 1A). The synergistic effect of GTN
and H89 on SW480 cells was also observed in 2 murine
colon cancer cell lines (CT26 and C51) and in a human
mammary cancer cell line, T47D (Figure 1B) which was
time dependent (Figure 1C). In subsequent experiments,
we explored the molecular mechanism of this synergistic
effect in SW480 cells.

The GTN/H89 combination induces caspasedependent apoptosis
As high doses of GTN induce apoptosis in a
caspase-dependent manner [11], the role of caspases
in apoptosis induced by the combination of H89 with
lower doses of GTN was investigated. Cell death
induced by the H89/GTN combination was inhibited by
a 1-h pre-treatment with the inhibitor zVAD-fmk (75 μM)
(Figure  2A). By adding fluorogenic substrates to cell
lysates we found that the drug combination activated
enzymes that cleaved Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-LEHD-AMC
and Ac-AEVD-AFC, suggesting caspase-3, caspase-9, and
caspase-10 activation, and to a lesser extent, Ac-IETDAMC, suggesting caspase-8 activation (Figure 2B). In
addition, immunoblot analysis showed poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), a well known caspase substrate, was

NO and cGMP signalling pathway are required
for GTN/H89-mediated apoptosis

cleaved in cells exposed to the H89/GTN combination
(Figure 2C) and flow cytometry showed a dissipation of
the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ m), an
early requirement for apoptosis, as attested by the increase
of the percentage of depolarized cells (Figure 2D, 2E).

As a NO donor, the contribution of GTN to the
synergistic effect of the GTN/H89 combination is
likely due to the release of NO. Exposure of SW480
cells to 10 μM GTN induces the release of nitrite in
the culture medium (> 4 μM at 48 h compared to <
1 μM in controls; Figure 4A). H89 did not significantly
increase the GTN-induced NO production (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, the NO scavenger (4-carboxyphenyl)4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO)
significantly lowered GTN and GTN/H89-induced nitrite
levels (Figure 4B), and abrogated GTN/H89-mediated
apoptosis (Figure 4C). This suggests that NO production
was required for the combination to induce apoptosis.
Since NO is a potent activator of guanylyl cyclase/
cGMP/PKG signalling pathway [18], we investigated the
possible involvement of this pathway in the GTN/H89
combination induced-apoptosis. Exposure of SW480 cells
to 10 μM GTN, 10 μM H89 or H89/GTN combination
synergistically increased the intracellular level of cGMP
as evaluated by ELISA (Figure 4D). Of note, the inability
of other NO donors to synergize with H89 was not due to
their inability to induce cGMP production, since SNAP
and ISDN induced cGMP production (Figure 4D). This

The sensitizing effect of H89 with GTN may not
depend on kinase inhibition
H89 was described as a potent inhibitor of PKA [12,
13]. H89 also inhibits p70 ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K1),
mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1)
and the Rho kinase ROCKII [14, 15]. SW480 cells were
exposed to 10 μM H89, either alone or combined with 10
μM GTN, and this significantly inhibited phosphorylation
of the transcription factor CREB, a downstream target of
PKA [16] (Figure 3A). However, neither another selective
inhibitor of PKA, KT5720 [17] (Figure 3B), nor the
specific down-regulation of PKA regulatory chain alpha
(PKA RIα) by RNA interference (Figure 3C), created
an apoptosis-inducing synergy with GTN in SW480
cells. Similarly, S6K1 inhibition with rapamycin, MSK1
inhibition with SB203580 and PD98059 combination,
and ROCK II inhibition with Y27632 did not mimic the
sensitization of SW480 cells to GTN-induced apoptosis
(Figure 3D).

signalling intermediate seems to be involved in H89/
GTN-mediated cell apoptosis since exposure of SW480
cells to 500 μM Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS, a competitive
inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG),
significantly decreased the sensitization of SW480 cells to
the combination (Figure 4E). Furthermore, the inhibition
of phosphodiesterase by zaprinast, known to increase
cGMP level, rendered cells more sensitive to H89-induced
cell apoptosis (Figure 4F), indicating that upregulation

of cGMP and then PKG activation were required for the
combination to induce apoptosis.

induced by the GTN/H89 combination was investigated.
Exposure of SW480 cells to 10 μM H89 for 48 h induced
the production of ROS including superoxide anions (O2−)
and H2O2, as evaluated by flow cytometry using cellpermeable dihydroethamine (DHE) and dihydrorhodamine
123 (DHR123), respectively (Figure 5A). GTN alone, at
10 μM for 48 h, did not induce the production of ROS
or did not increase ROS production when combined
with H89 (Figure 5A). In order to determine the origin
of ROS produced in H89-treated cells, we investigated
the involvement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, a well known enzyme that
catalyzes ROS production. The combination’s ability to
trigger apoptosis was attenuated by approximately 60
and 40% by two NADPH oxidase inhibitors [20], namely
diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, respectively
(Figure 5B), suggesting that this enzyme is required
for the superoxide production resulting from exposure
to H89. ROS production may be required for the H89/
GTN combination to induce apoptosis as the latter was
prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)
(Figure 5C). Because NO and superoxide anions together
generate peroxynitrite, a high toxic compound, we
wondered whether this oxidative agent was responsible for
GTN/H89-induced apoptosis. Treatment of cells with the
peroxynitrite scavenger FeTPPS [21] (at concentrations up
to 100 μM) did not significantly affect the sensitivity of
SW480 cells to the H89/GTN combination (Figure 5D),
suggesting that peroxynitrite generation was not involved
in apoptosis induction. Of note, one can speculate that
the failure of the other NO donors to synergize with H89
could be due to their capacity to inhibit H89 activity. To

address this question, we evaluated their impact on H89induced ROS production. Exposure of SW480 cells to
SNAP or ISDN and H89 did not abolish the ability of H89
to induce ROS production (Figure 5E).

GTN/H89-induced apoptosis involves ATP
receptors
H89 was suggested to competitively inhibit enzyme
activities at the ATP-binding site of various kinases [22].
We wondered whether this ability to compete with ATP
could be extended to purinergic receptors and could
account for its synergistic effect with GTN. RQ-PCR was
used to test the expression of different purinergic receptors
in SW480 cells: P2X(3, 5, 7)R, and P2Y(1, 2, 4, 6, 12)
R are expressed whereas P2X(1, 2, 4, 6)R and P2Y(11)
R mRNAs were not detected (Figure 6A). Exposure of
SW480 cells to suramin, a nonselective inhibitor of
purinergic receptors, induced a slight, dose-dependent
decrease in GTN/H89-induced apoptosis (Figure 6B).
Agonists of purinergic receptors such as ATP (Figure
6C) and 3’-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (Bz-ATP), a more
potent prototypic P2X7 receptor agonist (Figure 6D)
dose-dependently impaired induction of apoptosis by the
H89/GTN combination whereas UTP, another agonist of
purinergic receptors, was ineffective (Figure 6E). Of note,
several other ligands for purinergic receptors such as ATP,
UDP, meATP, and TNP-ATP were ineffective to synergize
with GTN to induced apoptosis (data not shown). Cells
were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides specific
to P2X3, P2Y1 and P2Y6, down-regulating the expression

of these receptors. In these cells H89/GTN-induced
apoptosis was prevented (Figure 6F) further suggesting
a role for these receptors in cell death induction. As
phospholipase C beta (PLCβ) is a downstream effector of
purinergic receptor signaling, the possible involvement
of this enzyme in H89 effect was investigated. Treatment
of SW480 cells with a PLC-selective inhibitor U-73122
(at 2.5 μM) reduced apoptosis induced by H89/GTN
combination, whereas the inactive analog of U-73122,
U-73343, did not (Figure 6G), suggesting that activation
of PLC-β was required for the combination to induce
apoptosis.

by GTN and ROS production induced by H89. This latter
conclusion is supported by previous reports in which
increase of cellular cGMP and activation of PKG induced
apoptosis in SW480 cells [25].
The effects of H89 appear to require several
P2 receptors. P2-purinergic receptors can modulate
proliferation, apoptosis [26, 27] and differentiation [28]
in malignant cells. Identified targets of H89 include
P2X3, which is one of the seven ionotropic non-selective
monovalent gating cation channels, and P2Y1 and P2Y6,
which are two of the eight members of the P2-purinergic
receptor family that are coupled to trimeric G proteins
[29]. Activation of P2X7 and P2Y1 receptors with high
concentrations of extracellular ATP triggered colon cancer
cell apoptosis [26], whereas low concentrations of ATP
or UTP stimulated cell proliferation through P2Y1 and a
downstream pathway that involves PKC, Src kinases and
cell surface metalloproteases [26, 27]. Activation of the
P2Y6 receptor has also been reported to protect normal
cells from apoptosis induced by TNF-α [30–32]. We show
here that exposure of cells to purinergic receptor agonists
such as ATP clearly affects the GTN and H89 synergy.
Although we have not demonstrated how the inhibition of
purinergic receptors affects the synergistic activity of H89,
one can speculate, however, that these receptor inhibitors
could prevent H89 binding to the corresponding purinergic
receptors.

DISCUSSION
High doses of GTN can induce cancer cell apoptosis
[23, 24, 8] and this compound could be efficient as an
adjuvant to chemotherapy in the treatment of human
cancers [3] . The present study suggests that the efficacy
of GTN could be improved by combining it with the
isoquinolinesulfonamide H89, commonly described
as a selective inhibitor of protein kinases, especially
protein kinase A. Surprisingly enough, the efficacy of
the combination does not depend on the kinase inhibition
properties of the drug. The H89/GTN combination triggers
a caspase-dependent apoptosis that involves a cGMPdependent mechanism through NO production induced

The H89 molecule is thought to compete with ATP
at its binding site within some protein kinases [22]. It may
also compete with ATP in binding to some purinergic
receptors. In the cell line studied, H89 appears to inhibit
an anti-apoptotic signal mediated by these receptors, thus
sensitizing cancer cells to GTN-induced apoptosis. The
effect is very specific as it could not be reproduced by other
molecules of the isoquinolinesulfonamide family, namely
H7, H8, and H9. In addition, although NO release from
GTN is required for the observed apoptosis, combining
H89 with other NO donors does not reproduce the synergy
of the H89/GTN combination. The discrepancy between
GTN and the other NO donors to synergize with H89 was
not due to a possible inhibition of H89 activity by the other
NO donors, since neither isosorbide dinitrate nor SNAP
were able to affect H89-mediated ROS production, but
may be related to the intracellular location of NO, therefore
affecting different targets. Indeed, whether almost NO
donors release spontaneously NO in aqueous medium
and reach extracellular and intracellular proteins, GTN
undergoes biotransformation by mtALDH, which occurs
in mitochondria [33], leading to local NO accumulation
and modification of mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial
proteins that can be modified by nitrosylation include the
F1-ATPase alpha1 subunit [34], complex II (succinate:
ubiquinone oxidoreductase) [35], and complex III
(ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase) [36]. S-nitrosylation of
cytochrome c oxidase causes the mitochondrial membrane
potential to dissipate [37]. Complex I S-nitrosylation is a
factor in Parkinson disease [38].
Our study also shows that cGMP/PKG signaling
plays a key role in GTN and H89 synergy. Indeed, the
increasing of cGMP induced by GTN and H89 (Figure
4D) and presumably by an inhibitor of PDE5 (a catabolism
enzyme of cGMP) dictates the synergistic effect between
GTN an H89. Although, we are not able to definitely
demonstrate that the cGMP signaling alone is sufficient
to induce this synergy, our results favor this hypothesis.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 4E, the PDE5 inhibitor, known
to stabilize cGMP, induced apoptosis in cancer cells.
ROS generation could possibly occur upstream of cGMP
signaling in GTN/H89-mediated apoptosis [39].
Mitochondrion is also a major source of oxygen
free radicals in the form of superoxide [40, 41]. It is
unlikely to be the site of production of this oxygen
radical in cells exposed to H89 since inhibition of the
different mitochondrial complexes involved in superoxide
generation did not mimic H89 cooperation with GTN in
inducing cancer cell apoptosis (not shown). By contrast
pharmacological inhibition of another major source of
superoxide, the glycolytic NADPH oxidase enzyme,
mainly present in the cytosol [42], significantly reduced
GTN/H89-mediated cell death. These results highlight
the fact that the cooperation between NO and superoxide
in inducing cell death is somehow dependent on their
localized subcellular production.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To conclude, we suggest that the promising results
obtained with GTN in treating malignant tumors could be
improved by combining it with H89 to eliminate cancer
cells that express P2 receptors through inducing their
death by apoptosis.

GTN was purchased from Merck (Lyon,
France). H89 [N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]5-isoquinolinesulfonamide.2HCl], H7, H8, and H9
were purchased from Tebu-bio (Le Perray en Yvelines,
France). H89 (like H7, H8 and H9) is a member of the
isoquinolinesulfonamide group of protein kinase inhibitors
and tends to exhibit selective inhibition of protein
kinase A (PKA) [12, 43]. Rp-8-bromo-b-phenyl-1,N2ethenoguanosine 3’:5’-cyclic monophosphorothionate
sodium (Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS), a competitive inhibitor
of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) was from
Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). The
broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z benzyloxycarbonylVal-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was
purchased from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany),
KT5720 and FeTPPS from VWR (Strasbourg, France),
a colorimetric cGMP Direct immunoassay kit from
Biovision (Milpitas, CA) and all other chemicals and
reagents from Sigma-Aldrich or local suppliers.

Cell culture and transfection
The human SW480 and the murine CT26 and C51
colorectal cancer cells and the human T47D mammary
cancer cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in a 1:1
(vol/vol) mixture of DMEM and HAM-F10 (Biowhittaker,
Fontenay-sous-Bois, France) supplemented with 5%
fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco BRL, Eriny, France) and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine at 37°C in a dry atmosphere.
Cells were routinely detached with 0.125% trypsin, 0.1%
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and washed once
in the culture medium before treatment. Transfection
was done by adding 5 μg of plasmid DNA to 3 x 106
cells for 4 h in the presence of Superfect transfection
reagent (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Transfected cells
were harvested 24 h later. Cell viability was not affected
by the transfection. The PKA siRNA assay kit used for
transfection (Upstate, Dundee, UK) contained 4 pooled
selected siRNA duplexes each with “UU” overhangs and
a 5’ phosphate on the antisense strand.
Antisense nucleotides (5 μM) were used to
downregulate candidate purinergic receptors in SW480
cells as described [44] using the Superfect and the
Lipofectamine 2000TM transfection reagents as outlined
by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France).

Quantification of nitrates and nitrites

Samples containing 50 μg of protein were incubated
in loading buffer (125 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10%
β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol and 0.003%
bromophenol blue), separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
blotted onto PVDF membrane (BioRad). After blocking
non-specific binding sites for 2 h with 8% non fat milk
in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS), the membrane was
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
(Abs): anti-PARP (Cell Signaling, Saint Quentin Yvelines,
France), anti-CREB (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France),
anti phospho-CREB (Cell Signaling), anti-PKA RIα (BD
Transduction Laboratories, Le Pont de Claix, France) or
anti-HSC-70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA). After three washes in TPBS, the membrane was
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Abs as appropriate for 30 min
at room temperature, then washed three times in TPBS.
An enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Luminol,
Santa Cruz) and autoradiography were used to develop
immunoblots.

NO production was determined indirectly by
measuring the amount of nitrite and nitrate in cell
culture media using the Griess microassay as described
[45]. Briefly, 100 μL of culture supernatant was added
to 100  μL of Griess reagent (0.5% sulfanilamide and
0.05% naphtylethylenediamine in 2.5% phosphoric acid).
Absorbance was measured at 540 nm in a multiwell
microtiter plate reader. Nitrite concentrations were
calculated by comparison with a standard sodium nitrite
solution.

Counting of apoptotic cells
Cells (3 x 105 per mL of culture) were treated with
10 μM GTN and/or 10 μM H89 for 48 h at 37°C. After
treatment, the whole population of cells (including plasticattached and floating cells) was washed in cold phosphate
buffer saline (PBS) and exposed for 15 min to 1 μg/mL
Hoechst 33342 at 37°C. Fluorescence microscopy was
used to view the differences in chromatin staining and the
percentage of apoptotic cells (those showing chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation) was determined
by scoring 300 cells for each sample.

Detection of ΔΨm
The ΔΨm was measured by flow cytometry using
the lipophilic cation JC-1 (5,5’, 6,6’-tetrachloro-1,1’,3,3’tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide) (Molecular
Probes, Invitrogen, Germany). JC-1 stains mitochondria
in cells with high mitochondrial membrane potentials
by forming orange-red fluorescent J-aggregates that
emit at 590 nm upon excitation at 490 nm. In cells with
depolarized or damaged mitochondria, JC-1 becomes
monomeric and emits at 525 nm with the 490 nm
excitation wavelength. Cells were incubated with 5 μg/
ml JC-1 for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. Cells were then
washed in PBS and analyzed immediately in a flow
cytometer (LSRII, BD Biosciences). A total of 10 000
cells were analyzed for green fluorescence with a 525-nm
filter and for orange fluorescence with a 590-nm filter. All
data were analyzed with FlowJo.

Caspase activity measurement
Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40
(NP-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min at 4°C
and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Samples
of the supernatant (50 μg protein) were incubated in assay
buffer (100 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazineN’-2-ethanesulfonic acid) pH 7.0,1 mM EDTA, 0.1%
CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1propane sulfate), 10% glycerol, 20 mM dithiothreitol) in
the presence of 100 μM fluorogenic peptide substrates:
Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-IETD-AMC, Ac-LEHD-AFC
(Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) or Ac-AEVDAFC (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Released
AMC and AFC were excited at 380 nm and 400 nm and
emission measured at 460 and 505 nm, respectively.
Fluorescence was monitored continuously at 37°C for 30
min in a dual luminescence fluorimeter (MicroTek OS,
Bio-Tek Kontron Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).

Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS)
Intracellular peroxide and superoxide levels in cells
were assessed using dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123)
and dihydroethidium (DHE) (Molecular Probe Inc.,
Eugene, OR, USA) using a flow cytometer (LSRII; BD
Biosciences). DHE is mainly oxidized by superoxide
anions while DHR123 reacts with superoxide anion and
hydrogen peroxide. A total of 10 000 cells were analyzed
within 60 min of staining.

Immunoblot analysis
Cells (3 x 105 per mL of culture) were washed
twice with cold PBS and boiled in buffer (1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mmol/L sodium-orthovanadate,
10 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4) in the presence of a cocktail
of protease inhibitors (Roche) for 10 min at 4°C. The
viscosity of the samples was reduced by ultrasound.
Lysates were harvested and the protein concentration
was measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit.
