Abstract
Despite recent therapeutic advances that have doubled the
median survival time of patients with multiple myeloma, intratumor genetic heterogeneity contributes to disease progression
and emergence of drug resistance. miRNAs are noncoding small
RNAs that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression and have been implicated in cancer progression and drug
resistance. We investigated the role of the miR-221–222 family in
dexamethasone-induced drug resistance in multiple myeloma
using the isogenic cell lines MM1R and MM1S, which represent models of resistance and sensitivity, respectively. Analysis
of array comparative genome hybridization data revealed gain of
chromosome X regions at band p11.3, wherein the miR-221–222
resides, in resistant MM1R cells but not in sensitive MM1S cells.
DNA copy number gains in MM1R cells were associated with
increased miR-221–222 expression and downregulation of p53upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) as a likely proapoptotic target. We conﬁrmed PUMA mRNA as a direct target of
miR-221–222 in MM1S and MM1R cells by both gain-of-function

and loss-of-function studies. In addition, miR-221–222 treatment
rendered MM1S cells resistant to dexamethasone, whereas antimiR-221–222 partially restored the dexamethasone sensitivity
of MM1R cells. These studies have uncovered a role for
miR-221–222 in multiple myeloma drug resistance and suggest
a potential therapeutic role for inhibitors of miR-221–222 binding to PUMA mRNA as a means of overcoming dexamethasone
resistance in patients. The clinical utility of this approach is
predicated on the ability of antisense miR-221–222 to increase
survival while reducing tumor burden and is strongly supported
by the metastatic propensity of MM1R cells in preclinical mouse
xenograft models of multiple myeloma. Moreover, our observation of increased levels of miR-221–222 with decreased PUMA
expression in multiple myeloma cells from patients at relapse
versus untreated controls suggests an even broader role for
miR-221–222 in drug resistance and provides a rationale for
the targeting of miR-221–222 as a means of improving patient
outcomes. Cancer Res; 75(20); 4384–97. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

of resistance (1). Therefore, to develop more effective treatments
and improve patient outcome, it is imperative to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating drug
resistance in multiple myeloma. Many treatment regimens
include novel agents in combination with dexamethasone; unfortunately, however, multiple myeloma cells often become dexamethasone resistant (1).
The exact basis for the beneﬁcial mechanism of action of
glucocorticoids in cancer treatment has not been fully and deﬁnitively elucidated, although the apoptotic pathway is considered
to be the main target. It is thought that glucocorticoid-induced
apoptosis is initiated via activation of transcription of deathspeciﬁc genes, and inhibition of the apoptotic cascade is believed
to occur via negative modulation of proinﬂammatory cytokines
that block transcription of death-speciﬁc genes (2). During prolonged exposure to dexamethasone, it is believed that resistance
apparently stems from downregulation of glucocorticoid receptor
(GR) gene expression (3). Although only one GR gene has been
identiﬁed, several GR proteins (e.g., GRa and GRb) can be
generated by alternative splicing of the mRNA. GRa is expressed
at relatively higher levels than GRb in most tissues and plays a
major role in dexamethasone -induced apoptosis. However, the
mechanism of GRa downregulation in dexamethasone-resistant

Despite recent advances in treatment, multiple myeloma
remains incurable due to tumor progression and the emergence

The Role of miR-221/222 in Multiple Myeloma Dexamethasone Resistance

patients remains somewhat ambiguous (3). Other mechanisms of
induced dexamethasone resistance have been proposed and
include the following: (i) overexpression of the ABC transporter
that will decrease intracellular dexamethasone levels, leading to
resistance (4); (ii) blocking of the proapoptotic effect of dexamethasone by cytokines secreted by the bone marrow microenvironment, or via binding of multiple myeloma cells to bone
marrow stroma, in either case inducing cell adhesion–mediated
resistance (5).
miRNAs are small (22nt) noncoding RNAs that negatively
regulate protein-coding gene expression by enhancing degradation or inhibiting translation of mRNAs (6, 7). Dysregulation
of miRNA expression is frequently detected in multiple myeloma and has been associated with increased metastatic potential and poor clinical outcome, suggesting an important role
for miRNAs in multiple myeloma disease progression (8).
miR-221 and miR-222 are highly homologous miRNAs
encoded on the X-chromosome (9) and designated as the
miR-221–222 cluster. This cluster has been found to be overexpressed in a large variety of human cancers, including hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma (10). It has
been shown that miR-221–222 promotes oncogenesis by
downregulating the expression of tumor suppressors such as
the proapoptotic protein p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and the bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death
(BIM; ref. 11). Here, we have used the isogenic cell lines MM1R
and MM1S, which represent resistance and sensitivity, respectively, to dexamethasone, to delineate a pathogenetic role of
the miR-221–222 cluster in promoting dexamethasone resistance in multiple myeloma via downregulation of PUMA, and
inhibition of apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and human tumor tissues and RNA isolation.
MM1S and MM1R cell lines were obtained from the ATCC.
miRNA proﬁling in MM1S and MM1R cells
Total RNA was isolated from MM1R and MM1S cells grown in
tissue culture or isolated from xenografts using TRIzol reagents
(Invitrogen), and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis or whole-genomic miRNA proﬁling using TaqMan Low
Density microRNA Array (AM1792, Invitrogen). Expression of
each miRNA was presented directly using their threshold cycle
number (Ct). Upregulated miRNAs are with low Ct number while
downregulated miRNAs are with high Ct number.
qRT-PCR and immunoblot analyses
qRT-PCR for evaluating miR-221, miR-222, and PUMA mRNA
levels was performed as previously described (12). The primers for
miR-221(#000524), miR-222(#000525), U44(#001094), PUMA
(#Hs00248075_m1), and GAPDH (#Hs99999905_m1) were
purchased from Applied Biosystems. Immunoblots were
obtained as previously described (13). Primary antibodies included: anti-PUMA (#4976, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-BAX
(#2772; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-cleaved caspase-3

antibodies included: anti-rabbit IgG (#W4011; Promega),
anti-mouse IgG (#W4021; Promega), and anti-actin (#sc-1615;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Plasmids and 20 -OMe–modiﬁed anti-miR-221/222
Viral expression vectors of miR-221–222 (V-miR-221–222)
were created by PCR utilizing normal human DNA and the
following pair of primers: V-miR-221–222 (F) (EcoR1) TAGCGAATTCGCTCCCCAGAAGGCAAAGGAT, and V-miR-221–222
(R) (Not1) CTTCGCGGCCGCTGGTGAGACAGCCAATGGAG,
then cloned into the EcoR1 and Not restriction sites of pCDHCMV-EF1-GFP viral vector (#CD511B-1; System Biosciences). The
packaging system was used according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The sequences of as-miR-222 and as-miR-221 were
50 -ACCCAGUAGCCAGAUGUAGCU-30 , and 50 - GAAACCCAGCAGACAAUGUAGCU-30 , respectively. Scrambled 20 -OMe-modiﬁed RNA (50 -AAGGCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGU-30 ) was used as a
negative control.

The following oligos were obtained from Integrated DNA
Technologies: as-221–222-EN(F) 50 -AATTCGAAACCCAGCAGACAATGTAGCTACCCAGTAGCCAGATGTAGCTGAAACCCAGCAGACAATGTAGCTACCCAGTAGCCAGATGTAGCTGAAACCCAGCAGACAATGTAGCTACCCAGTAGCCAGATGTAGCTGAAACCCAGCAGACAATGTAGCTACCCAGTAGCCAGATGTAGCTgc-30 , as221–222-EN(R) 50 -GGCCGCAGCTACATCTGGCTACTGGGTAGCTACATTGTCTGCTGGGTTTCAGCTACATCTGGCTACTGGGTAGCTACATTGTCTGCTGGGTTTCAGCTACATCTGGCTACTGGGTAGCTACATTGTCTGCTGGGTTTCAGCTACATCTGGCTACTGGGTAGCTACATTGTCTGCTGGGTTTCg-30 . The oligos were dispensed into annealing buffer and inserted into the EcoRI site of
pCDH-CMV-EF1-GFP (#CD511B-1, System Biosciences). The
construct is pCDH-CMV-as-miR-221–222-EF1-GFP with 3 repeat
of antisense of miR-221 and miR-222 sequences (50 -GAAACCCAGCAGACAATGTAGCTACCCAGTAGCCAGATGTAGCT-30 ),
and is referred to as V-as-miR-221–222-GFP.
Argonaute 2 binding RNA immunoprecipitation quantitative
RT-PCR
Argonaute 2 (AGO2) binding RNA immunoprecipitation analysis were performed as described (14). MM1S V-GFP and MM1S
V-miR-221–222-GFP stable transduced cells (3  107 per RNA
immunoprecipitation experiment) were washed with ice-cold
PBS and dispensed into 1 mL of cell lysis buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP 40)
containing Protease inhibitor (#5871S, Cell Signaling Technology) and RNase inhibitor (#N808-0119, Invitrogen) for 20 minutes on ice. Lysates were microcentrifuged at maximum speed for
20 minutes at 4 C, and supernatants were collected and precleared with 20 mL of Protein A and G Dynabeads coupled with 5
mg of normal Rabbit IgG (#SC-3888, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
The beads were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants
incubated with Dynabeads A and G coupled with 5 mg of antiAGO2–speciﬁc antibody (#2897S; Cell Signaling Technology) or
5 mg IgG isotype control antibody (#SC-3888; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 C, followed by three time washes with
washing buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCL pH 7.5, 300 mmol/L NaCl,
1mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP 40, Protease inhibitor). After pulldown
by centrifugation, RNA was extracted using 1000 mL TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR detection of pulled-down PUMA

mRNA and miR-221/222 was performed as described in the
section of qRT-PCR.
PUMA open reading frame overexpression virus
PUMA cDNA lacking a 30 UTR was ampliﬁed from pHAPUMA plasmid (Plasmid #16588, Addgene; ref. 15) using the
following pair of primers: PUMA-V-dsRed-F-EcoR1, 50 -GCTAGCGAATTCGCCGCCACCATGGCCCGCGCACGCCAG-30 and
PUMA-V-dsRed-R-BamH1, 50 -CCGCGGATCCATTGGGCTCCATCTCGGG-30 . The PCR products were puriﬁed and cloned into
the EcoR1 and BamH1 restriction sites of the pCDH-CMV-EF1dsRed viral vector (herein referred as V-PUMA-dsRed), and to
allow sorting by ﬂow cytometry using the red ﬂuorescent
protein dsRed as a marker.
BH3 domain proﬁling in multiple myeloma cells
MM1R V-dsRed and MM1R V-PUMA-dsRed stable transduced
cells were subjected to BH3 proﬁling as previously described (16).
Brieﬂy, cells were permeabilized with digitonin and exposed to
BH3 peptides on a 384-well plate. Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss induced by the peptides was measured
over a period of 3 hours with the help of the radiometric dye JC-1
and a Tecan plate reader. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization, expressed as a percentage of control values, was calculated
from the area under the curve for each peptide, and was normalized relative to the solvent-only control, dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), designated as 0%, and, as a positive control, the ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-triﬂuoromethoxyphenylhydrazone
(FCCP), designated as 100%.
Locked nucleic acid miRNA in situ hybridization and
immunostaining
Locked nucleic acid miRNA in situ hybridization (LNA-ISH)
was performed and analyzed as previously described (12) following the instruction of the DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit
(#11175041910; Roche). The sequences of digoxigenin (DIG)labeled oligos were LNA-miR-222 (50 -DIG-accCaGtAgCcAgaTgTAgct-30 ), and LNA-miR-221 (50 -DIG-gaaacCcaGcaGacAaTGtAGct-30 ). Capital letters indicate LNA modiﬁcation.
Immunostains were performed according to our routine procedures (12). Brieﬂy, formalin-ﬁxed tissues were embedded in
parafﬁn, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Sections (4 mm) of formalin-ﬁxed tissue were used for immunohistochemical analysis after baking at 60 C for 1 hour, deparafﬁnization, and rehydration. The sections were then blocked for
peroxidase activity with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
10 minutes, washed under running water for 5 minutes, and
ﬁnally pressure-cooked at 123 C in citrate buffer (DAKO Target
Retrieval Solution, S1699) for antigen retrieval. The slides were
cooled for 15 minutes, transferred to Tris-saline (TBS), and
incubated with primary antibodies (5 mg/mL) or the corresponding IgG fraction of preimmune serum overnight at 4 C in blocking
solution consisting of containing 3% BSA in PBS. Anti-human
primary speciﬁc antibodies included were PUMA (#AB9643,
AbCam), BAX (#5023P; Cell Signaling Technology), and BAK
(#6947S; Cell Signaling Technology), cleaved caspase-3 (#9664;
Cell Signaling Technology), and were visualized with the aid of
the corresponding biotinylated antibody coupled to streptavidinperoxidase complex (Vector Labs). Optimal antibody concentrations were used according to recommendations of the manufacturer. Incubations were carried out under a CO2 humidiﬁed

atmosphere at room temperature, and slides were incubated with
VECTASTAIN Universal ABC Kit (Vector) for 30 minutes and
rinsed with PBS between each incubation. The sections were
developed using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich)
as the substrate, and were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin. Frozen and formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded human primary multiple myeloma cells were obtained from the Tissue
Procurement Facility at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI,
Boston, MA) in accord with Institutional Review Board protocols.
For cleaved caspase-3 immunostains, cells were ﬁrst spun down
onto slides using a cytocentrifuge (Shandon), then ﬁxed in
methanol:acetone for 2 minutes, and washed in PBS prior to
immunostaining.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed with MTT, as previously described
(17). A total of 1  104 MM1S V-GFP and MM1S V-miR-221–222GFP stable transduced cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate, and
after 24 hours of incubation were treated with dexamethasone
(20 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), bortezomib (PS-341; Velcade;
10 nmol/L, LC Laboratories), lenalidomide (1 mmol/L, AVA
Chem), melphalan (1 mmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich), doxorubicin
(25 ng/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), or DMSO/Ethanol alone as control
for 48 hours and then subjected to the MTT assay.
In vitro luciferase reporter assay
Two reporter plasmids that could recognize the miR-221–222
target PUMA 30 UTR were constructed into pmiR-REPORT plasmid
(#AM5795, Life Technologies), pmiR-PUMA-wt and pmiRPUMA-mut, that served as conserved and nonconserved target
sites of PUMA 30 -UTR, respectively. The sequences were as follows:
pmiR-PUMA-wt(F), CGCGTGACTTTCTCTGCACCATGTAGCAGACTTTCTCTGCACCATGTAGCAGACTTTCTCTGCACCATGTAGCAGGATCCA; pmiR-PUMA-wt(R), AGCTTGGATCCTGCTACATGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCTGCTACATGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCTGCTACATGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCA; pmiR-PUMA-Mut(F), CGCGTGACTTTCTCTGCACCTACATCGTGACTTTCTCTGCACCTACATCGTGACTTTCTCTGCACCTACATCGTGGATCCA; pmiR-PUMAMut (R), AGCTTGGATCCACGATGTAGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCACGATGTAGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCACGATGTAGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCA. The primers were annealed and inserted into the pmiRReporter construct (Ambion). Empty pmiR plasmid (pmiR-0)
served as a negative control. Triplicate samples of 1  104 MM1S
and MM1R cells in 24-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.1 mg of the reporter plasmids and
0.05 mg of Renilla control plasmid (Promega). Six hours after
transfection, the cells were fed with fresh DMEM with 10% FBS
and incubated overnight. Cell extracts were then prepared, and
luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized
with respect to parallel Renilla activities.
Mouse xenograft models of tumor burden and metastasis
A total of 5  106 MM1S cells stably transduced with V-miR221–222-GFP or V-GFP and MM1R cells, stably transduced with
V-as-miR-221–222-GFP or V-GFP, were injected via the tail
vein into CB17.Cg-PrkdcscidLystbg-J/Crl mice (Code 250,
Charles River) to establish a disseminated human multiple myeloma xenograft model as previously described (12). Survival
was evaluated from the ﬁrst day of tumor injection until
death. All mice were intraperitoneally injected with 9 mg/kg

The Role of miR-221/222 in Multiple Myeloma Dexamethasone Resistance

dexamethasone-21-phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) on
days 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20. Mice were observed daily and
sacriﬁced when hind limb paralysis was detected. Hind limb
paralysis and tumor burden were used as an endpoint. To assess
in vivo cell proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of miR-221–
222 target genes, GFP-positive tumor samples were excised for
immunohistochemical analysis, as in previous studies (12). All
experiments involving animals were preapproved by the DFCI
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
The MM1R-Luc-GFP tumor dissemination mouse model
Totally 15 NOD/SCID mice were injected via the tail vein with 5 
106 MM1R-Luc-GFP cells (Gift from Dr. Constantine S. Mitsiades, at
DFCI), and one week after injection, the mice were randomized to
separate to control and treated groups and treated by intraperitoneal
injection once a week with vehicle, RNA-LANCErII (BioScience) to
control mice, or 1:1 as-miR-221 and as-miR-222 (as-miR-221–222
mix; 100 pmol total, pre-mixed in RNA-LANCErII) to treatment
group mice. All mice were intraperitoneally injected with 9 mg/kg
dexamethasone-21-phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) on
days 2–5, 9–12, 17–20, and 25–28. Tumor development was
monitored by whole-body imaging using a Xenogen system. Mice
were evaluated every week after initiation of treatment, and survival
was evaluated from the day of tumor injection until death.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were analyzed by the unpaired
Student t test (with the exception of survival curves). Kaplan–
Meier survival curves were generated using Prism software and
compared using a log-rank test. In all statistical analyses, P  0.05
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Differential expression of miR-221–222 in MM1S and MM1R
myeloma cell lines
To study the mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in multiple myeloma, two isogenic cell lines were previously generated
(18): the parental cell line MM1S and the resistant MM1R subline.
To investigate a possible role of miRNAs in promoting dexamethasone resistance in MM1R cells, we ﬁrst performed genome-wide
miRNA expression analysis in MM1R and MM1S cells using
miRNA arrays. We found that 10 miRNAs were upregulated
(Fig. 1A), whereas 12 others were downregulated in MM1R cells
(Fig. 1B) versus MM1S cells. These results prompted us to examine
CGH array data from the Broad Institute's Multiple Myeloma
Genomics Portal (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mmgp/home;
ref. 19). Copy numbers were log2-transformed prior to plotting
using the Broad's Integrative Genome Browser. Interestingly,
analysis of the data revealed copy number gains in the X-chromosome of MM1R as compared with MM1S cells, without signiﬁcant copy number differences in other chromosomal regions
(Fig. 1C, top). Interestingly, miR-222 was among the upregulated
miRNAs in MM1R cells. Increased levels of miR-221 and miR-222
expression in MM1R cells were conﬁrmed using qRT-PCR (Fig. 2F,
see below). More detailed examination of the X-chromosome
revealed that band p11.3, in which the miR-221–222 cluster
resides, has a normal gene copy number in MM1S cells but is
tetraploid in MM1R cells (Fig. 1C, bottom). Taken together, these
ﬁndings indicate that gene copy numbers contribute to higher
expression of the miR-221–222 in MM1R cells than in MM1S

www.aacrjournals.org

cells, suggesting a possible pathogenetic role for this cluster in
dexamethasone resistance.
PUMA plays a key role in the dexamethasone resistance in
MM1R cells
As dexamethasone promotes multiple myeloma cell death
through induction of apoptosis (20); we next examined expression levels of proapoptotic factors in MM1S and MM1R cells using
immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S1, PUMA expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in MM1R
cells as compared with MM1S cells. In agreement with the wildtype status of p53 in these two cell lines (21), equal levels of p53
protein were detected by immunoblots. To further verify that
PUMA plays a major role in promoting dexamethasone resistance
in MM1R cells, we lentivirally transduced MM1R cells with vectors
expressing dsRed protein alone as control (V-dsRed) or dsRed in
combination with PUMA (V-PUMA-dsRed). To exclude possible
endogenous miRNA regulation of transduced PUMA, the mRNA
encoding PUMA lacked 30 UTR sequences. After ﬂow cytometric
sorting of dsRed-positive cells, stably V-PUMA-dsRed- and VdsRed–transduced cells were ﬁrst examined by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 2B) and immunohistochemical (Fig. 2C, top) analysis to conﬁrm increased PUMA expression in V-PUMA-dsRed
cells, and then evaluated them for apoptosis in the absence or
presence of dexamethasone. As shown in Fig. 2C, apoptosis
observed by cleaved caspase-3 staining was greater in MM1R VPUMA-dsRed cells than in V-dsRed cells, especially after treatment
with dexamethasone. In addition, BH3 proﬁling revealed that
MM1R V-PUMA-dsRed cells were more primed to undergo apoptosis than V-dsRed cells (Fig. 2D), further highlighting the role of
PUMA as a mediator of dexamethasone resistance in MM1R cells.
The 30 UTR of PUMA mRNAs contains two binding sites for miR221–222
We next investigated whether PUMA mRNA expression is
regulated by miRNAs. We ﬁrst used miRNA target prediction
databases (TargetScan) to identify possible miRNAs targeting
PUMA among the upregulated miRNAs in our MM1S and MM1R
miRNA proﬁling data (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, miR-221 and miR222 were the top candidates that could target PUMA. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that miR-221 and miR-222 share a single
binding site on the 30 UTR of PUMA mRNA, which turns out to be
conserved across different species (Fig. 2E), suggesting a possible
role for these miRNAs in regulating PUMA expression. The inverse
correlation of miR-221–222 and PUMA mRNA expression in
MM1S and MM1R cells, as evaluated by qRT-PCR, further support
this possibility (Fig. 2F).
To directly demonstrate a physical and functional interaction
between miR-221–222 and the 30 UTR of PUMA, we made reporter
constructs containing empty (pmiR-0), wild-type (pmiR-PUMAwt), and mutant (pmiR-PUMA-mut) sequences of the 30 UTR of
PUMA mRNA (Fig. 2E). The constructs were transfected into
MM1S cells, which were subsequently mock-treated with celmiR-67 or treated miR-221–222 (Fig. 3A). After documenting
enforced expression of both miR-221 (Fig. 3A, top) and miR-222
(Fig. 3A, middle) by qRT-PCR, we observed that wild-type, but not
mutant, PUMA reporter activity was inhibited by miR-221–222
(Fig. 3A, bottom). To further deﬁne the role of targeting miR-221–
222 as a way to abrogate dexamethasone resistance, MM1R cells
transduced with pmiR-0, pmiR-PUMA-wt, or pmiR-PUMA-mut
reporter vectors were treated with control (scrambled miR) or

previous studies (Fig. 4), after ectopic upregulation of miR-221
and miR-222 expression in MM1S cells and transduction with VmiR-221–222-GFP, there was signiﬁcant downregulation of

observed that miR-221–222 and PUMA mRNA levels increased
in pulled-down AGO2 complexes from MM1S cells transduced

that upregulation of miR-221–222 recruits PUMA mRNA to the

To evaluate the therapeutic role of miR-221–222 in vivo, we next

mature miR-221 and miR-222 expression in vivo. We transduced
MM1R cells with either V-GFP as a control or antisense miR-221–

In contrast to preceding experiment, mice transplanted with
MM1R V-as-miR-221–222-GFP cells and treated with dexamethasone showed increased survival when compared with control
mice transplanted with MM1R V-GFP cells (Fig. 6A). These

changes in survival were associated with a lower tumor burden
in mice transplanted with V-as-miR-2221-221-GFP cells than
in mice transplanted with V-GFP cells as evaluated by wholebody imaging (Fig. 6B, top) as well as histologic examination (Fig.

sensitized the MM1R cells to dexamethasone-induced growth
arrest and apoptosis, thereby prolonging survival in tumor-bearing mice.
As-miR-221–222 treatment increases survival of MM1R cells
in vivo
We next performed a mouse xenograft experiment to evaluate
the therapeutic effect of in vivo delivery of 20 -OMe–modiﬁed
antisense-miR-221–222 (as-miR-221–222). We evaluated tumor
growth in mice transplanted with MM1R-luc-GFP cells after
intraperitoneal delivery of as-miR-221–222 using lipid nanoparticles in combination with dexamethasone. As shown in Fig. 6C,
survival increased in mice treated with as-miR-221–222 compared with mice treated with vehicle alone (52.4  10.2 days vs.
36.1  4.1 days, P < 0.05.), and was associated with decreased
tumor burden as evaluated by Xenogen imaging (Fig. 6D).
High levels of miR-221–222 expression correlates with low
levels of PUMA expression in multiple myeloma patient
samples
The above results prompted us to investigate the relationship
between miR-221–222 and PUMA mRNA levels in a large set of
multiple myeloma cells from patients to assess the role of these
molecules in drug resistance more broadly. We used published
datasets GSE16558 (23) for which both miRNA and mRNA gene
expression proﬁling were available. Interestingly, this analysis
showed a signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.001) and inverse relationship between
miR-221 and PUMA mRNA expression (Fig. 7A). We further
investigated this relationship using qRT-PCR in eighteen multiple
myeloma patients for whom clinical information, mRNA samples, and bone marrow biopsies were available (Supplementary
Table S1). Of these, 8 were from untreated, newly diagnosed
patients, and 10 were from patients with relapsed refractory
multiple myeloma. As shown in Fig. 7B, higher levels of miR221 with corresponding lower levels of PUMA mRNA were
observed in multiple myeloma cells from relapsed refractory
versus newly diagnosed patient. In the case of miR-222 and PUMA
mRNA levels, this inverse correlation was less evident; however,
samples from two refractory patients had relatively high levels of
miR-222 expression with lower levels of PUMA mRNA expression.
One sample (MM2) had high levels of both miR-221 and miR222. To further investigate the relationship between miR-221–
222 and the downstream targets PUMA, Bak and Bax, we performed LNA-ISH and immunohistochemical stains, respectively,
on bone marrow biopsies. Interestingly, an inverse correlation
was observed between miR-221–222 expression and PUMA, BAK,
and BAX expression. Two representative cases, a newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma (MM2) and a refractory multiple myeloma
(MM10), are show in Fig. 7C. Taken together, the results revealed
higher levels of miR-221 and/or miR-222 expression with corresponding lower levels of PUMA expression in a subset of samples
from refractory multiple myeloma patients as compared with
those from untreated, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Therefore, the miR-221–222 cluster, by regulating expression of the
proapoptotic regulator PUMA, may more broadly mediate drug
resistance leading to disease progression in multiple myeloma.

Discussion
Disease progression in multiple myeloma is due partly to
development of drug resistance. Dexamethasone is an effective

4394 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

therapeutic agent against multiple myeloma; however, resistance
eventually develops, signaling the arrival of unwelcome relapse.
Previous studies have shown that tumor cells from steroid-resistant multiple myeloma patients have lower expression of the GR
than those from steroid-sensitive patients, but the molecular
mechanisms for clinical dexamethasone resistance remain poorly
understood. In this study, we offer the ﬁrst evidence for a role of
the miR-221–222 cluster in mediating dexamethasone resistance
and disease progression in multiple myeloma. Importantly, we
provide compelling preclinical proof-of-concept experiments setting the stage for a novel antisense pharmacologic strategy to
abrogate dexamethasone resistance speciﬁcally linked to
enhanced expression of the miR-221–222 cluster that downregulates PUMA expression. The latter is a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)only Bcl-2 family member, and a critical mediator of p53-dependent and -independent (FOXO3a and p73) apoptosis induced by
a wide variety of stimuli, such as: genotoxic stress, deregulated
oncogene expression, toxins, altered redox status, growth factor/
cytokine withdrawal, and infection while at the same time triggering drug resistance (24). Our experiments show that direct
targeting of the miR-221–222 cluster can abrogate this general
mechanism of drug resistance, and because its target PUMA is a
downstream regulator of apoptosis, it is likely that as-miR-221–
222 therapy should not only overcome dexamethasone resistance
but also resistance to other drugs, including novel agents such as
Lenolinamide, as well as p-53-dependent and -independent
mechanisms of drug resistance (Fig. 7D).
miR-221 and miR-222 are highly homologous miRNAs
encoded as a cluster from a genomic region on the X-chromosome
(9). They are widely overexpressed and involved in the pathogenesis of many human cancers including thyroid papillary
carcinoma (25), glioblastoma (26), colorectal (27), lung (28),
pancreas (29), ovarian (30), breast (17), gastric (31), liver (32),
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (33) and lymphoma (34).
Accumulating in vitro evidence implicates the miR-221–222 cluster as an oncogene that bypasses cell quiescence and increases the
survival (35), proliferation (36), and metastatic potential of
cancer cells (37). This cluster has also been shown to promote
oncogenesis via downregulation of several tumor suppressor
proteins including p27 (38, 39), p57 (35), PTEN (31), PUMA
(40), BIM (11), TIMP3 (41), and many others (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21743492; refs. 26, 42). We and others
have also found that miR-221–222 is highly expressed in multiple
myeloma (10, 43), and we ﬁrst time found that miR-221–222
targets PUMA in multiple myeloma cells. However, in the referred
study (44), it was found that PTEN, BIM, p27, and p57 were also
targets of miR-221–222 in other multiple myeloma cell lines,
indicating that the target of these miRNAs are cell type–speciﬁc
and/or dependent on the physiologic or pathologic state of
the cells.
Our studies further indicate that inhibition of miR-221–222 via
antisense therapy offers an enticing approach by which to overcome drug resistance more broadly. In dexamethasone resistance
as it operates in the MM1S/MM1R cellular model, the target
PUMA is downstream of the GR. Therefore, downregulated
expression of PUMA mRNA via as-miR-221–222 therapy could
trigger apoptosis independently of the status of the GR receptor. In
addition, p53 mutations, which are highly recurrent in multiple
myeloma, and are associated with primary drug resistance (45),
as-miR-221–222 treatment may abrogate drug resistance and
promote apoptosis even in the presence of p53 mutation by

documenting higher levels of miR-221–222 in refractory than in
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients suggest that as-miR221–222 therapy may prevent, or at least delay, dexamethasone
resistance in particular and perhaps resistance more broadly in

doxorubicin. With regard to the possibility of overcoming multiple myeloma resistance to Lenolinamide (46) using as-miR221–22 therapy, it is worth mentioning that this effect is also
expected to take place by regulating PUMA levels and apoptosis
rather than regulating the levels of Cerebron (CRBN) and the
binding proteins (IKZF-1 and IKZF-3) as no consensus bindings

sites for miR-221–222 are present in the 30 UTR of CRBN mRNA
(data not shown). Although our studies indicate that as-miR-221–
222 could be used as a therapy to overcome drug resistance in
multiple myeloma patients, additional preclinical studies will be
needed to further validate this hypothesis. In addition, these
studies should include the development of better delivery systems
that could provide tumor speciﬁc uptake of miRNAs and avoid
off-target effects.
Finally, miR-221–222 expression may be a useful prognostic
marker in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (47), papillary thyroid
carcinoma (48), and lung cancer (49). In light of our ﬁndings, use
of these miRNAs to predict prognosis and clinical response to
dexamethasone and/or other drugs warrants similar evaluation in
patients with multiple myeloma.
