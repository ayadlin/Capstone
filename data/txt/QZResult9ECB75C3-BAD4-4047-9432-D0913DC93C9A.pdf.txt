ABSTRACT
Purpose: Despite significant therapeutic progress in multiple myeloma, drug
resistance is uniformly inevitable and new treatments are needed. Our aim was to
identify novel, efficacious small-molecule combinations for use in drug resistant
multiple myeloma.
Experimental Design: A panel of 116 small molecule inhibitors was used to
screen resistant myeloma cell lines for potential therapeutic targets. Agents found
to have enhanced activity in the bortezomib or melphalan resistant myeloma cell lines
were investigated further in combination. Synergistic combinations of interest were
evaluated in primary patient cells.
Results: The overall single-agent drug sensitivity profiles were dramatically
different between melphalan and bortezomib resistant cells, however, the
bromodomain inhibitor, CPI203, was observed to have enhanced activity in both the
bortezomib and melphalan resistant lines compared to their wild-type counterparts.
The combination of bortezomib and CPI203 was found to be synergistic in both
the bortezomib and melphalan resistant cell lines as well as in a primary multiple
myeloma sample from a patient refractory to recent proteasome inhibitor treatment.
The CPI203-bortezomib combination led to enhanced apoptosis and anti-proliferative
effects. Finally, in contrast to prior reports of synergy between bortezomib and
other epigenetic modifying agents, which implicated MYC downregulation or NOXA
induction, our analyses suggest that CPI203-bortezomib synergy is independent of
these events.
Conclusion: Our preclinical data supports a role for the clinical investigation of
the bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 combined with bortezomib or alkylating agents
in resistant multiple myeloma.

regimens including novel agents (proteasome inhibitors
or immunomodulators) and standard chemotherapies

progress, MM remains incurable. Currently the most

of relapse in the era of novel agents is greater than 30
months, a recent study found that once a patient becomes
refractory to bortezomib (BTZ), the median overall
survival diminishes to only 11 months [2]. Thus, the
development of new strategies to overcome the resistance
to novel agents is needed.
With a rapidly increasing number of targeted agents
available in the preclinical setting, an effective and
high throughput approach for identifying active agents
followed by rationally designed treatment is desirable.
We have developed a panel of molecularly targeted smallmolecule inhibitors for direct interrogation of primary
leukemia patient samples that collectively informs
pathway dependence, and identifies candidate therapeutic
options [3]. In our present study, we used a similarly
constructed panel of 116 targeted agents to screen MM
cells, including BTZ and melphalan resistant lines for the
establishment of rationale drug combinations for resistant
MM. The compounds comprising this panel were selected
using three basic criteria 1) clinical relevance, 2) breadth
of coverage of both kinase and non-kinase targets, and 3)
knowledge of on- and off-target activities. As a result, this
panel of agents exhibits activity against two-thirds of the
tyrosine kinome as well as numerous other kinase families
including PI3K/AKT, PKC, PKA, IKK, RAF/MEK/ERK,
JNK, p38, AMPK, aurora kinases, and cyclin-dependent
kinases. In addition, this panel also exhibits coverage of
a variety of non-kinase targets including the proteasome,
HSP70/90 proteins, the BCL2 and BET families, as well
as the WNT/β-catenin, and sonic hedgehog pathways. A
bromodomain inhibitor was among the compounds that
showed particular promise in the drug resistant cell lines
and therefore was the focus of our follow-up investigation.
BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family
proteins include BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT and are
the so called “readers of the histone modification code”.
Bromodomain (BRD)-containing proteins selectively
bind to the acetyl lysine marks placed by histone
modifying enzymes (HATs, HDACs) [4]. BET inhibitors
are a promising new class of anticancer agents because
BET family proteins BRD2/3/4 are chromatin adaptors,
functionally linked to pathways important for cellular
viability and cancer signaling. In particular, the direct
role of BRD4 in regulating transcription has recently
been described. BRD4 is an atypical kinase that directly
phosphorylates the serine 2 site of the carboxyl-terminal
domain of RNA polymerase II, which is required for the
recruitment of RNA splicing factors. Therefore, BRD4
has a direct role in regulating transcription [5]. Targeted
BET inhibition using (+)-JQ1, a selective BRD4 inhibitor
leads to the downregulation of MYC [6-8]. While MYC
downregulation has been the focus of most BRD4 inhibitor
studies, it has been shown to represent only one of nearly
3000 transcriptional changes induced by (+)-JQ1 [9]. (+)JQ1 has shown promising activity in multiple preclinical
cancer models [6, 7, 10-15], including MM xenograft
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

models [6].
MYC pathway activation can be involved in
MM pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms.
Transcriptional profiling identifies MYC pathway
activation in up to 67% of MM patient samples [16]. In
early MM increased MYC RNA expression can be seen,
while later in the disease MYC rearrangement can occur
and is associated with aggressive progression involving
extramedullary disease [17]. Further, interferon regulatory
factor 4 (IRF4), a transcription factor, can become
dysregulated and contribute to the activation of MYC
independent of the oncogenic transforming mechanism
[18].
Report of a myeloma mouse model involving a
MYC transgene showed activity with (+)-JQ1 alone and
in combination with bortezomib or a deacetylase inhibitor.
In particular it was noted that activity with these agents
persisted even after the model was serially passaged to
induce BTZ resistance [19]. In our present study, we tested
CPI203, a readily bioavailable selective BET inhibitor
(BRD4 IC50 = 26 nM) with similar biologic activity to
(+)-JQ1 [5, 20]. CPI203 has been evaluated in a preclinical
BTZ resistant mantle cell lymphoma model associated
with increased basal MYC expression. In that setting,
CPI203 was found to exert antitumor effects through the
downregulation of MYC and IRF4 [8]. Our data further
characterizes the activity of BET inhibition using CPI203
in BTZ resistant MM and its synergistic role with BTZ in
this setting.

RESULTS
Small molecule inhibitor screen confirms known
MM targets
Using a panel of 116 targeted agents, we performed
cell viability testing on BTZ (ANBL6 BR and 8226.BR)
and melphalan (8226/LR5) resistant cell lines, in addition
to the well characterized “parent” MM cell lines U266,
ANBL6 WT, and RPMI8226 from which the resistant
lines were derived.
Concentration of inhibitor required to suppress
cell growth and viability by 50% (IC50) was obtained
for each individual agent across the various cell lines.
In order to prioritize on-target effects across the large
panel, we compared the IC50 values from the tested
MM cell lines to the pooled results of 151 patient bone
marrow aspirate samples tested on the same panel that
we have previously published [3]. Table 1 displays these
normalized values (referred to as R50). Higher R50 values
represent increasing hypersensitivity of the myeloma cells
to a particular agent relative to the collective experience
of that same agent over our previously published cohort of
151 diverse hematologic malignancy specimens [3]. The
18922

small-molecule inhibitors with the top 10 greatest R50
values included three PKC inhibitors, two Aurora kinase
inhibitors, two PI3K inhibitors, an AKT inhibitor, a CDK2
inhibitor, and the multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib. These
hypersensitive pathways identified by our screen are well
supported by the work of others who have described these
pathways as promising targets in MM [21-29].

an increased sensitivity to another drug. Given our aim
to identify novel combinations for drug resistant disease,
we directly compared the differences in the IC50 values
between our resistant lines (8226.BR, ANBL6 BR, and
8226/LR5) with their wild type parent lines (RPMI8226
and ANBL6 WT). Dividing the wild type IC50 values by
the resistant cell line IC50 values represents the relative
fold magnitude increase sensitivity the resistant lines
have to a particular agent. Figure 1 and supplementary
Table S3 display the drugs with the greatest increased
sensitivity in the resistant cell lines (highest IC50 WT line/
IC50 resistant line). Interestingly the mTOR, PI3K, JAK,
ALK, and IGFR1 inhibitors gained the most sensitivity
upon BTZ resistance, while proteasome, aurora kinase,

Bortezomib and melphalan resistant cell lines
have distinct targeted pathway sensitivity profiles
One can postulate that the biological alterations that
occur upon acquiring resistance to one drug may lead to

Figure 1: Enhanced drug sensitivities in bortezomib resistant cells. The values listed under WT IC50 ÷ BR IC50 represents the
fold magnitude increased sensitivity in the BTZ resistant cell lines as compared to their wild type parent cell lines (IC50s for ANBL6 WT ÷
ANBL6 BR, and RPMI 8226 ÷ 8226.BR). These values were obtained by dividing the IC50 values for the wild type MM cell lines (RPMI
8226 and ANBL6 WT) by the corresponding IC50 value of the BTZ resistant cell line. The table is in rank order for the top 30 drugs with
the greatest increase in sensitivity in the BR cell lines. Relative hypersensitivity displayed as heatmap as follows: Red indicates greatest
hypersensitivity in the BTZ resistant cells relative to its paired BTZ sensitive cell line. Yellow or a numeric value of 1.0 indicates neutral
sensitivity (sensitivity in BTZ resistant cells is equivalent to its paired BTZ sensitive cell line). Gray indicates greater resistance in the BTZ
resistant cells relative to its paired BTZ sensitive cell line. See supplementary Table S4 for the table of all 116 agents tested.

R50 values represent the pooled patient sample median IC50 value divided by the median IC50 value from the myeloma
cell lines tested. Therefore, the R50 value represents the fold magnitude increased sensitivity to a drug in the MM cell lines
compared to the pooled database control. IC50 data for each drug for each patient specimen used to generate the median
patient IC50 values have been previously published [3]. Note that the RPMI 8226 IC50 values used represents a mean of the
wild type RPMI 8226 strains that were obtained from 3 separate sources as described in Table 2. IC50 values are listed as
nanomolar units. See supplementary Table S2 for the complete table of all agents tested.

and HER2 inhibitors gained the most efficacy within
the acquired melphalan resistance setting. While there
was very little overlap in general between the melphalan
and BTZ resistance profiles, CPI203 emerged as one of
the top drugs in both the melphalan and BTZ resistant
settings. CPI203 showed the greatest increase in efficacy
in the BTZ resistant cell lines, at nearly 17 fold increased
efficacy in the BR setting compared to its WT counterpart.
CPI203 also showed increased sensitivity in the melphalan
resistant cell line relative to its WT parental line.

17p deletion, gain of 1q, t(4;14), and monosomy 13. A
significant synergistic effect was shown at low nanomolar
concentrations of BTZ and CPI203 at 48 hours, even
overcoming the cytoprotective effects of the native bone
marrow microenvironment (Figure 3C).

CPI203 and BTZ synergy is independent of MYC
downregulation or NOXA induction
Studies have illustrated that the effects of
proteasome inhibition converge with the induction of
NOXA, a proapoptotic protein that triggers cell death
through both caspase- and non-caspase-dependent
pathways [30]. NOXA has been shown to be under
transcriptional regulation by MYC [31]. Given that small
molecule BET inhibitors have been shown to reduce
the expression of MYC [5-8, 20], we further explored
the synergistic mechanism between BTZ and CPI203.
Immunoblotting of lysates from ANBL6 WT and ANBL6
BR cells treated with BTZ and CPI203 for NOXA and
MYC revealed that single agent BTZ induced the expected
dose-dependent rise in NOXA, but did not appear to
significantly impact MYC expression levels. Single agent
CPI203 led to a dose-dependent decrease in MYC, but
had little effect on NOXA expression. When BTZ was
combined with CPI203, there was a relative decrease in
the induction of NOXA compared to cells treated with
BTZ alone. The combination did not appear to have any
further impact on MYC levels compared to the effects
of CPI203 alone. We also performed immunoblotting
of untreated cell lysates to determine if the enhanced
sensitivity of ANBL6 BR to CPI203 was related to any
differences in basal NOXA or MYC expression (Figure 4).
There were relatively reduced basal levels of both MYC
and NOXA expression in ANBL6 BR compared to WT.

CPI203 and bortezomib are synergistic in vitro
The activity of CPI203 was of particular interest due
to the impressive enhancement of activity in both the BTZ
and melphalan resistant cell lines compared to their wild
type counterparts. We therefore investigated CPI203 in
combination with BTZ. The combination of CPI203-BTZ
showed synergy in the MTS cell viability assay in both
ANBL6 WT and ANBL6 BR, as well as in 8226/LR5, but
not the wild type RPMI8226 based on calculated CI values
(Figure 2). The greatest degree of synergistic activity was
seen in the BTZ resistant line based on the CI of 0.35 at
ED90 drug concentrations. The lack of synergy identified
in wild type RPMI8226 is likely due to its exquisite
baseline sensitivity to single agent BTZ.
We next aimed to determine if the inhibitory effect
of CPI203 was due to apoptosis or was primarily antiproliferative. Treatment of ANBL6 WT and ANBL6 BR
with various combinations of BTZ and CPI203 for 72
hours induced the accumulation of cells in early apoptosis
marked by annexin V+, 7-AAD negative, and to a lesser
extent late apoptosis (Annexin V+, 7-AAD+). At low
concentrations of CPI203 (40nM in WT line, or 160nM in
BR line), there was no enhancement of apoptosis either as
single agents or when added to BTZ. At a concentration of
1600nM, CPI203 exerted increased apoptosis as a single
agent as well as in combination with BTZ (Figure 3A).
To better understand the effects of the combination
on cell growth kinetics, ANBL6 WT and BR cells were
exposed to different concentrations of BTZ and CPI203,
and serial cell counts were assessed based on guava
ViaCount over the course of 72 hours (Figure 3B).
BTZ treatment led to a clear reduction in the number of
viable cells compared to the starting cell count, while
cells treated with single agent CPI203 exerted more of
a cytostatic effect indicating that CPI203 may be antiproliferative at lower doses. Apoptosis was only seen at
higher concentrations or when combined with BTZ.
We next examined the effects of CPI203 and
BTZ in a primary patient bone marrow sample from a
patient with relapsed-refractory MM with 90% marrow
involvement, who had previously taken BTZ and
progressed on carfilzomib (2nd generation proteasome
inhibitor). Cytogenetic analysis of the MM sample
showed high risk genetic features including: chromosome

DISCUSSION
The panel of small molecule inhibitors we used to
screen myeloma cell lines contained many agents with
multitarget and overlapping inhibitory properties. This
built in redundancy of the panel enabled us to better
evaluate the on-target effects of agents targeting multiple
nodes of a common signaling pathway. Concordant
results between multiple agents of varying chemotype
that target the same pathway provide additional validation
of the identified candidate pathways. We showed that this
screening panel was able to detect well-known MM targets
as the “top hits” which provides strong evidence that
accuracy is maintained within this high-throughput assay.
This panel approach allowed us to rapidly identify many
promising targets and individual compounds for further
investigation, many of which remain unexplored.
As drug resistance has major treatment and
prognostic implications in MM, we focused on further

describing CPI203, an agent that showed intriguing
effectiveness in drug resistant cell lines on our smallmolecule inhibitor screen. The ability of CPI203
monotherapy to suppress growth was enhanced in both
the BTZ and melphalan resistant cells compared to
their wild type counterparts. Further, the combination
of CPI203-BTZ was synergistic in both the BTZ and
melphalan resistant cell lines as well as in a primary
bone marrow sample from a patient with MM. In BTZ

resistant cells, the CPI203-BTZ combination appeared to
have antiproliferative effects as well as enhancement of
apoptosis. Given that CPI203 is thought to work in part by
reducing MYC levels it was surprising to find lower basal
MYC expression in the BTZ resistant cell line despite
being more sensitive to this drug. Further, the diminished
MYC expression in the BTZ resistant cell line is contrary
to a prior report that BTZ resistance is associated
with increased MYC expression [8]. Moreover, the

CPI203-BTZ combination failed to further reduce MYC
expression and did not enhance NOXA induction over
BTZ alone. Though a 20 nM dose of BTZ did not cause
significant apoptosis in the BTZ resistant line, there was
strong NOXA induction at this dose, suggesting that these
resistant cells are able to survive despite activation of the
NOXA mediated apoptotic pathway. While we showed
that a synergistic relationship between CPI203 and BTZ
exists, the mechanism for the synergy and hypersensitivity
of BTZ resistant cells to CPI203 is less clear but appears
to be independent of MYC or NOXA alterations.
Just as the mechanism of BTZ efficacy appears
to be multifactorial, so does the mechanism for drug
resistance. While multiple BTZ resistant cell lines have
been evaluated, a unifying mechanism for resistance
remains elusive. Reported mechanisms include
overexpression or mutations in PSMB5 (the proteasomal
target of BTZ), P-glycoprotein expression (efflux pump),
microenvironmental upregulation of IL-6, IGF-1, or tumor
upregulation of HSP90, PI3K, MYC, and IGF-1 [8, 3236]. BTZ resistant cell lines are reported to have reduced
NOXA and caspase 3 activation in response to BTZ [37,
38]. In ANBL6 BR specifically, it has been shown that
increased IGF-1 expression and secretion as well as
increased AKT expression likely contributes to resistance.
Likewise, it has been reported that inhibitors of the PI3K/
mTOR and IGF-1R can act synergistically with BTZ, and
may re-sensitize BR cells to BTZ [33]. Our data supports
the finding of enhanced sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR
pathway inhibitors in the BTZ resistant cell lines, and we
also found enhanced sensitivity to IGF-1R inhibition in the
8226.BR cell line (data shown in Figure 1).
Additionally, a recent report suggests that higher
MYC expression promotes survival through activation
of the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 dependent aggresome
pathway, a resistance mechanism known to be important
in the setting of proteasome inhibition [39]. Evidence for
MYC overexpression leading to enhanced proliferation,
extramedullary progression, and possibly BTZ resistance
provides the rationale for targeting MYC inhibition in
effort to re-sensitize BTZ resistant MM to proteasome
inhibition. This is further supported by data published
showing activity of a BET inhibitor in a BTZ resistant
transgenic MYC activated mouse model [19].
Our data show that treatment with CPI203 sensitized
both BTZ resistant and sensitive cells to BTZ despite the
CPI203 mediated downregulation of MYC and NOXA
expression. The mechanism for the synergistic effect
in the BTZ resistance setting is unlike those previously
described in the literature. In contrast to previous reports
[31, 40] showing a reliance on MYC expression for
BTZ sensitivity and that suppressed MYC expression is
associated with a reduction in BTZ sensitivity, we found
that pharmacologically suppressed MYC expression with
CPI203 resulted in enhanced sensitivity to BTZ. Further,
unlike a recently described report [8], we did not find that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the BTZ resistant phenotype was associated with MYC
pathway upregulation, as the basal MYC expression in the
BTZ resistant cell line was actually lower than its wild
type parent cell line.
The synergistic mechanisms of the BTZ
combinations that have been studied also seem to vary.
The effect of combining a deacetylase inhibitor (ie
panobinostat or vorinostat) with BTZ in MM has been
described [19, 40, 41]. It has been shown that upon
proteasome inhibition, MM cells utilize the aggresome
pathway in an attempt to manage the excess misfolded
proteins to avoid apoptosis. HDAC6 is involved in the
acetylation of alpha-tubulin and facilitates shuttling
of the aggresome to the lysosome for degradation.
HDAC6 inhibitors interfere with aggresome function,
leading to NOXA mediated apoptosis upon activation
of cellular stress responses in part via caspase activity.
The synergistic effects of BTZ + vorinostat was found
to be related to increased NOXA induction and was
additionally dependent on MYC expression [40], again
unlike what we found for BTZ + CPI203. Further, reports
describing the major transcriptional changes related to
treatment with these agents appear to differ significantly
[6, 7, 9, 42]. Lastly, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,
5-azacitidine has been found to synergize with BTZ, and
similar to deacetylase inhibitors, the apoptotic effects of
5-azacitidine involves NOXA upregulation [43]. Others
have reported BTZ mediated apoptosis can occur despite
silencing of NOXA and can even occur in the MYC
depleted setting, though the degree of apoptosis was
reduced [30, 31, 40]. Other NOXA independent apoptotic
pathways exist and are likely biologically relevant, though
details of these are not well understood.
Our data suggests that the previously reported
reliance on MYC expression for NOXA-mediated
apoptosis is more complicated, and likely involves other
mediators. Accumulating data on role of MYC in BTZ
resistance supports the notion that there is an intricate
balance of MYC expression levels, and the influence
of other mediators may tip the balance toward either a
proliferative or apoptotic phenotype. Based on our data,
we may simply hypothesize that CPI203 downregulates
MYC enough to preferentially reduce proliferation and
aggresome mediated survival, yet permitting enough
NOXA expression for BTZ potentiated apoptosis.
However, given the far-reaching transcriptional effects of
BET and the pleotropic effects of proteasome inhibition,
the synergistic relationship observed is likely far more
complex. While the precise mechanism of the synergistic
relationship is not clearly understood at this time, the
combination of BTZ + CPI203 shows compelling
responses that are consistent across multiple in vitro
settings. Collectively our findings provide support for the
clinical investigation of combined BET and proteasome
inhibition in drug resistant MM.

The BTZ and melphalan resistant cell lines (ANBL6 BR, 8226.BR, and 8226/LR5) were developed as previously described
[33, 44]. Note that RPMI 8226 (wild type) was obtained from 3 sources, in each comparison between a drug resistant line
and its wild type counterpart; we used the wild type RPMI 8226 cells obtained from the same source as the drug resistant
cells to which it was compared, unless otherwise noted.

by the institutional review board at Oregon Health and
Science University. The bone marrow aspirate underwent
independent clinical pathologic review and was composed
of 90% myeloma cells. Red cell lysis of the bone marrow
sample with Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK)
buffer was performed. Given the significant myeloma cell
population, and to preserve the marrow microenvironment,
CD138 selection of tumor cells was omitted. The primary
bone marrow cells were seeded at a concentration of 3.0
x 105 cells/mL and incubated for 48 hours in R10 media
supplemented with 1ng/mL IL-6, then tested for cell
viability using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
proliferation assay (Promega).

cell lines used are depicted in Table 2. All cell lines were
obtained from sources within 6 months of use. The BTZ
and melphalan resistant cell lines (ANBL6 BR, 8226.BR,
and 8226/LR5) were developed as previously described
[33, 44]. Specifically, ANBL6 BR and 8226.BR were
previously subjected to gene expression profiling by
source authors and was found to have a number of genomic
changes and enhanced susceptibility to IGF-1R blockade
as compared to their wild type parent lines, ANBL6 WT
and RPMI 8226 [33]. While gene expression profiling
was not repeated, our confirmation of enhanced IGF-1R
sensitivity provides evidence of authentication of these
cell lines (see Results section above). All cell lines were
grown in R10 media, consisting of RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies). Media
was supplemented with 1ng/mL of human recombinant
IL-6 (Peprotech) for IL-6 dependent cell lines (ANBL6
WT and BR). ANBL6 BR and 8226.BR were grown in the
presence of 10 nM bortezomib (Selleck Chemicals) while
8226/LR5 was grown in the presence of 5 µM melphalan
(Sigma).

Cell line small-molecule inhibitor plates and cell
viability assay
Cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates at a
concentration of 3.0 x104 cells/mL in 50 µL of media
per well and incubated for 72 hours. All cell lines were
initially screened using a panel of small molecule
inhibitors as previously described [3]. All drugs were
obtained from commercial vendors with the exception of
CPI203, which was generously provided by Constellation
Pharmaceuticals. Supplementary Table S1 lists the smallmolecule inhibitors included on the screening plate as
well as their targets and the sources from which they were
obtained. All drugs were dissolved and stored in DMSO.
In all cell culture experiments the final concentration of
DMSO used was ≤0.1%. Unless otherwise noted, when
testing two drugs for synergy, the two drug combinations
were plated in serial constant ratio concentrations in
96-well plates with a HP D300 Digital Dispenser. Cell
viability testing was performed on the small-molecule
inhibitor screening plates and synergy plates using the

Apoptosis assays
Cells were stained for Annexin V-PE/7-AAD as
per manufacturer instructions (Guava Nexin, Millipore)
after mechanical resuspension. The relative percentage
of cells undergoing apoptosis was then quantified by
flow cytometric analysis (Guava PCA flow cytometer,
Millipore). All apoptotic measurements were performed
in duplicate.

Immunoblotting
Cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) with
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma),
aprotinin (Sigma), and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma) was used to make cell lysates. Proteins were
separated by electrophoresis on Tris-HCL precast gels
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins were transferred to
PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) with pore
size 0.45um for MYC and 0.22um for NOXA blots then
probed with antibodies against MYC (Cell Signaling),
NOXA (Calbiochem), actin (Millipore), and GAPDH
(Ambion). Chemiluminescence detection was performed
using Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) or
SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo Scientific) and viewed
using ChemiDoc MP imaging system with Image Lab
software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Version 4.1).
