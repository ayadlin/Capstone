Abstract
The chemical form and bioavailability of dietary selenium may
influence its protectiveness against colorectal cancer. Selenium is readily incorporated into milk proteins by feeding cows
with selenized-yeast. This study examined whether a dairy
source of organic selenium (as milk proteins) is more effective
than a yeast source at inhibiting oncogenesis in carcinogentreated mice and whether it regulates the homeostatic
response to carcinogen-induced DNA damage. Dietary interventions are as follows: selenium-enriched milk protein
isolate (Tatura-Bio Se; 0.5 or 1 ppm selenium) or milk protein
control and selenized-yeast (Sel-Plex; 1 or 4 ppm selenium)
with casein or casein alone as control. After 4 weeks on diet,
mice received a single azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) injection to
induce mutations and were killed 6 hours later. Measures were
as follows: plasma selenium, cell proliferation, and acute
apoptotic response to azoxymethane (AARGC). Separate
groups of mice on the same diets were given 4 weekly
azoxymethane (15 mg/kg) injections to induce oncogenesis.
Mice were killed 6 or 30 weeks after the last azoxymethane
injection. Measures were as follows: aberrant crypt foci (ACF),
cancers, and K-ras mutations. Dairy-selenium at 1 ppm
significantly suppressed ACF and cancers, whereas yeastselenium at an equivalent selenium intake had no effect.
Dairy-selenium significantly increased plasma selenium levels
and AARGC, and reduced cell proliferation and frequency of Kras mutations in ACF relative to an equivalent dose of
selenium from yeast. Selenium-enriched milk protein isolate
is superior to selenized-yeast in terms of its bioavailability and
capacity to suppress oncogenesis. Suppression may be a
consequence of enhanced apoptotic deletion of azoxymethane-induced DNA lesions and the subsequent reduction in
frequency of K-ras mutations. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4936–44]

Introduction
Epidemiologic data suggest that people could reduce their cancer
risk through dietary change or supplementation with specific
micronutrients (1, 2). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most
frequent cause of cancer mortality in the world. Chemoprevention
represents an important and potentially feasible option for control
of this cancer. Selenium, an essential trace element, is required for a
number of metabolically important enzymes (3). It was first
mentioned as a possible protective agent against human cancer
>30 years ago (4). Because then, human epidemiologic studies have

indicated a significant inverse relationship between intake of
selenium and risk of cancer overall, including CRC (5). Selenium has
also been extensively investigated in laboratory studies. Selenium
was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects in various tumor cell lines as
well as in chemically induced tumors in animals (6).
The selenium concentration in foods varies significantly due to
variability in concentration and availability as inorganic salts from
soil (7). People living in regions of low selenium intake have
relatively higher rates of cancers (8). Improving dietary intake of
selenium through selenium-enriched food sources is one strategy
for increasing human selenium intake and, perhaps, reducing
cancer risk (9). Selenium-enriched plant foods have been shown to
significantly protect against CRC in animal models (10, 11).
Availability of selenium, however, does depend not only on the
dose of selenium, but also the form in which it is administered.
Like most foods, dairy products are not normally considered to
be a significant source of selenium. However, feeding organic
selenium to cows results in effective and rapid incorporation into
milk proteins (12–14). Such a source might be advantageous.
Several potential anticarcinogenic mechanisms have been
proposed for selenium, including induction of apoptosis (15),
protection from oxidative DNA damage, and improved immune
function. In this study, an azoxymethane-induced CRC animal
model has been used because this model is characterized by many
of the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of human CRC
(16, 17). Azoxymethane causes O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) adduct
(18); if O6-MeG is not repaired by DNA repair enzymes or removed
by apoptosis, it may lead to G to A transition, resulting in
irreversible mutations in the oncogene K-ras (19). Colorectal
oncogenesis involves aberrant crypt foci (ACF), which are the
earliest identifiable focal preneoplastic lesions of the adenomacarcinoma sequence, and K-ras mutations are early molecular
events found in ACF (20, 21). As such, K-ras mutations and ACF
serve as biomarkers for determining CRC risk. In our previous
studies, we showed that administration of azoxymethane to
rodents was rapidly followed 6 to 8 hours later by an acute
apoptotic response (termed AARGC) in the distal colon. Protection
against CRC by some dietary agents and drugs is associated with
their ability to up-regulate AARGC for controlling DNA damage
(22–27).
In this study, we compared a selenium-enriched milk protein
isolate with a selenized-yeast for their relative bioavailabilities at a
comparable selenium concentration and effects on azoxymethaneinduced oncogenesis. We also compared the two selenium sources
for their effects on glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, epithelial
AARGC and proliferation, and frequency of K-ras mutations in
resultant ACF.

selenium-enriched milk protein isolate (Tatura-Bio Se; 85% protein, 5 ppm
selenium) were provided by Tatura Milk Industries. The milk protein isolate
was prepared from milk, after lipid separation, using ultrafiltration
separation with a pore size of 10 kDa. Selenium yeast (Sel-Plex; 1,800 Ag
selenium per gram dry weight) was provided by Alltech Biotechnology P/L.
Animals. A total of 300 wild-type male mice of C57BL/6J strain were
obtained from the Animal Resource Centre, Adelaide University, Australia.
Animal protocols were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee at
Flinders University. Three experiments were performed, 60 mice were used
for a short-term experiment (4-wk homeostatic response to DNA damage),
60 mice for a 12-wk ACF experiment, and 180 mice for a long-term (36 wk)
tumor study. For each experiment, animals were divided randomly into 5 or
6 equal experimental groups (with comparable initial body weights), housed
in cages ( four per cage), and maintained in a temperature- and humiditycontrolled animal facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22 F 2jC
temperature and 80 F 10% humidity. Animals were given free access to
water, weighed weekly, and were monitored closely for clinical signs of ill
health throughout the study. Animals appearing sick were euthanased
immediately.
Diets. The experimental diets fed to the animals were based on a
modified form of AIN-76A diet for rodents (28). It contained 19% sunflower
oil and 20% protein, and L-methionine was not added. Newmark and
colleagues (29) have shown this New Western-style Diet to be associated
with ‘‘spontaneous’’ tumor development in C57BL/6 mice. Calcium was not
included in the mineral mix of milk proteins control (MP-Cont), milk
proteins 0.5 ppm selenium diet (MPSe0.5), and milk proteins 1 ppm
selenium diet (MPSe1) because the dairy protein sources have relatively
high calcium concentrations, but calcium was added as CaHPO4 to balance
calcium level (0.46%) in casein control (Cas-Cont), selenium yeast 1 ppm
selenium diet (CasYSe1), and selenium yeast 4 ppm selenium diet
(CasYSe4). Two control diets were used depending on the protein source,
either milk proteins or casein. They both contained relatively low levels of
selenium, 0.34 ppm selenium in milk proteins, and 0.29 ppm selenium in
casein. Further details of diets are provided in Table 1.
Dietary selenium and homeostatic response to azoxymethaneinduced DNA damage. Ten-week-old mice were assigned to each of

5 diet (n = 12 per group). After 4 wk on diet, animals were given a single
azoxymethane injection (10 mg/kg s.c.) to induce DNA damage and AARGC.
Six hours later, animals were killed by cardiac puncture after ketamine/
xylazine anesthesia, this being the time of maximal apoptotic response to
azoxymethane in the rodent (24). Two centimeters of distal colon was
removed, placed in 10% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin for
histologic and immunohistologic examination. Liver and the remaining
colon were fresh frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80jC.
Dietary selenium and azoxymethane-induced ACF formation. Fourweek-old mice were assigned to each of 5 diet (n = 12 per group). After 2 wk
on diet, animals received azoxymethane injections (15 mg/kg s.c.) weekly
for 4 successive wk. All animals remained on the same diet throughout the
study until killed 6 wk after the last azoxymethane injection. Colons were
removed, opened longitudinally, and fixed flat on hibond C paper in 10%
paraformaldehyde. For K-ras mutation analysis, ACF were microdissected
and trimmed to remove adjacent normal-appearing crypts. A distal segment
of colon was taken from animals (n = 6 per group) for assessment of
baseline apoptosis and cell proliferation.
Dietary selenium and azoxymethane-induced colon tumor formation. Four-week-old mice were assigned to each of 6 diet (n = 30 per group).
After 2 wk on diet, animals received 4 weekly azoxymethane injections
(15 mg/kg s.c.). All animals remained on the same diet throughout the study
until killed 30 wk after the last azoxymethane injection. Colons were
removed, opened, and fixed as described for ACF.
Preparation of blood and analysis of plasma selenium status. Blood
samples were obtained by direct heart puncture into heparinized vacutainer
tubes. Selenium concentration in the plasma was determined using the
fluorometric assay described by McIntosh and colleagues (30).
Assay of GPx activity. GPx activity was measured using a Glutathione
Peroxidase Cellular Activity Assay kit (Sigma). Samples were homogenized
in a buffer containing 1 mol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 mol/L EDTA, and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4jC. The protein concentration was
quantified using the Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). GPx activity was
determined in duplicate using 2.5 to 5 AL of the supernatant (15–30 Ag of
proteins), assayed in a 100 AL reaction volume containing 5 mmol/L

Figure 1. Effects of different selenium-containing diets on
plasma selenium concentration for experiment 1 (4 wk on
diet; A ) and for experiment 2 (12 wk on diet; B ), and on
GPx activity for colon (C) and liver (D ) each after 4 wk on
diet. Selenium intake as MPSe1, 1 ppm selenium-enriched
milk protein isolate, or CasYSe1 or CasYSe4, 1 or 4 ppm
selenized-yeast, showed significantly increased plasma
selenium concentrations in both experiments. A significant
dose-dependent effect was seen with the yeast source.
Plasma selenium concentration in mice fed MPSe1 were
significantly higher than those fed equivalent selenium in
CasYSe1 (P < 0.05). Selenium intake as 1 and 4 ppm
selenized-yeast significantly increased colon and liver GPx
activity, but maximal effect was reached with 1 ppm.
Selenium as MPSe1, however, had no significant effect
on GPx activity. Columns, mean; bars, SE. n = 12.

NADPH, 30 mmol/L H2O2, and 42 mmol/L reduced glutathione. The
oxidation of NADPH to NADP was monitored at 340 nm on UV/Vis
spectrophotometer.
Measurement of apoptosis. The frequency of epithelial cells undergoing
apoptosis was determined by hematoxylin staining as previously described
in detail by us and validated relative to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining (24). Twenty crypts
from distal colonic segments were chosen and assessed by an independent
observer unaware of the dietary treatments. The apoptotic index was
calculated as the number of apoptotic cells per crypt column divided by the
total number of cells in the column and multiplied by 100.
Measurement of epithelial proliferation. Proliferative activity of
epithelial cells was measured using immunohistochemical staining with
Ki-67 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). In brief, antigen retrieval was
carried out by heating sections in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer for 1 h. Sections
were incubated with Ki-67 antibody (1:1,000) overnight after incubation in
3% H2O2 for 20 min. Detection was by biotinylated secondary rabbitanti-mouse antibody (1:200; Dako) for 30 min and avidin/biotinylated
peroxidase complex (Signet Laboratories) for 20 min. Slides were visualized

by incubating with 3¶-diaminobenzamine substrate. The scoring for cell
proliferation was the same as the method used to score apoptosis.
Measurement of K-ras mutations. DNA was extracted using DNeasy
Tissue kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Mutations at codon 12 of K-ras gene was analyzed
by locked nucleic acid (LNA)-mediated real-time PCR clumping. This is a
sensitive new method for detecting point mutations, a modification based
on methods described previously in human studies (31). Briefly, a set of
primers ( forward, 5¶-AGGCCTGCTGAAAATGACTG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GGTACTTCTATCGTAGGGTCGTAC-3¶) was chosen to amplify a 121-bp genomic
fragment from exon 1; a wild-type LNA oligomer (CCTACGCCACCAGCTCCPH), which covered codons 10 to 14, was used to suppress the amplification
of wild-type DNA; and two 5¶-Cy5–labeled probes were used to enhance
the expression of specific mutant sequence, with 12Asp probe (Cy5TTGCCTACGCCATCAGCTCCAA-PH) for GAT mutation and 12Cys (Cy5TTGCCTACGCCACAAGCTCCAA-PH) for TGT mutation. Anchor probe was
3¶-labeled with fluorescence (CATCCACAAAGTGATTCTGAATTAGCTGTATCGTCAAGGCGCT-FL).
The primers, probes, and LNA oligomer were purchased from TIB
MOLBIOL.

diets on colonic epithelial acute apoptotic
response to genotoxic carcinogen (AARGC; A ),
baseline epithelial apoptosis (B), and cell
proliferation for experiment 1 (4 wk on diet; C ) and
experiment 2 (12 wk on diet; D ). Selenium intake
as MPSe1, 1 ppm selenium-enriched milk protein
isolate, and CasYSe4, 4 ppm selenized-yeast,
significantly increased apoptotic index (AARGC),
whereas they did not significantly affect baseline
apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells. Cell
proliferation (Ki-67 labeling index) was not
significantly affected by dietary selenium intake
after 4 wk on the diets. However, MPSe1 and
CasYSe4 significantly reduced Ki-67 labeling
index after 12 wk on diets. Columns, mean; bars,
SE; n = 12. *, P < 0.05 compared with their
respective control diets (MP-Cont or Cas-Cont ).

For PCR, 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 Amol/L sense and anchor probes, 0.005
Amol/L LNA, and 0.5 Amol/L forward and 0.1 Amol/L reverse primer with
20 ng of genomic DNA were added to make a final volume of 20 AL per
capillary. PCR was performed on a Rotor Gene 3000 (Corbert Research) with
acquisition at 470 nm/660 hp (FAM/Cy5FRET). The running conditions
were as follows: 10 min of initial denaturation at 95jC, 45 cycles of 20 s at
95jC for denaturation, 45 s for primer annealing and probe binding at 58jC,
and 20 s at 72jC for extension. Fluorescence was acquired at 58jC. After
holding the temperature at 95jC for 20 s and at 40jC for 20 s, melting curve
was analyzed by increasing the temperature from 40jC to 85jC with a slope
of 0.3jC per second. Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using Big
Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Twenty-four to thirty ACF (small and large) were randomly
selected from each group and analyzed for K-ras mutations.
Detection of ACF. The colons were stained with 0.1% methylene blue
and counted at 40 magnification using a dissecting microscope. ACF were
identified by increased size, elevated appearance from the surrounding
mucosa, and the slit-like shape of the luminal opening and scored from the

distal to proximal end without knowledge of the dietary treatment. Crypt
multiplicity was defined as the number of crypts in each focus, categorized
as small (1–3 crypts per focus) and large ACF (4 or more crypts per focus).
Detection of colon tumors. The colons were scored for macroscopically
visible tumors. Tumors were dissected, embedded in paraffin, and stained
by H&E for histopathologic evaluation to classify them as adenoma and
adenocarcinoma (23). Endpoints were colon tumor incidence (i.e.,
proportion of mice affected by a tumor), tumor multiplicity, tumor size,
and number of mice with adenocarcinomas (cancers). Tumor size was
calculated by the formula: log10 [f(k(diameter 1 + diameter 2))2/2] (32).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for
Windows, version 14.0 (SPSS, Inc.) and Stata version 10.0 (StataCorp). Data
were expressed as mean FSE. Between-group comparisons of apoptotic
index, Ki-67 index, plasma selenium concentration, and GPx activity were
assessed using one-way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons
by Tukey’s post hoc test. Between-group comparisons of K-ras, ACF counts
and tumor measures were assessed using logistic and Poisson regression,
respectively, with simple linear contrasts. Comparison of selenium at

equivalent concentrations (1 ppm) on tumor end points was further
assessed by two-way factorial Poisson models with an interaction between
selenium sources and protein type. Differences between groups were
considered significant when P value was <0.05.

Results
General observation. Dietary selenium supplementation either
as selenium-enriched milk protein isolate or selenized-yeast had
no significant effect on the animals during 4, 12, or 36 weeks of
feeding, at concentrations of 0.5, 1, or 4 ppm throughout the
studies. The body weights of animals fed selenium-containing diets
were comparable with those of the control diets (data not shown).
Twelve sick mice were killed before the termination of tumor study;
tumor end points from these mice were not included.
Effects of dietary selenium intake on plasma selenium
status. Plasma selenium concentration reflected dietary selenium
supplementation; it was lower in animals fed the control diets than
in animals fed the selenium-containing diets. Four weeks of feeding
of MPSe1 as 1 ppm selenium-enriched milk protein isolate, or
CasYSe1 or CasYSe4 as 1 or 4 ppm selenized-yeast significantly
increased plasma selenium concentrations compared with their
respective control diets (MP-Cont or Cas-Cont), with selenizedyeast showing a significant dose-dependent effect (Fig. 1A).
Importantly, plasma selenium concentration in animals fed MPSe1
was significantly higher than those fed a selenium-equivalent
CasYSe1. Twelve weeks of selenium feeding had a similar effect to
that of short-term selenium feeding (4-week) on plasma selenium
concentrations (Fig. 1B).
Effects of dietary selenium intake on GPx activity. GPx
activities in the colon and liver were significantly increased in
animals fed yeast-selenium diets, but the level in those fed CasYSe4
was not significant higher than in those fed CasYSe1 (Fig. 1C and D).
Our observations suggest GPx activity is maximized when feeding
1 ppm selenized-yeast. In contrast, GPx activity were not different in
animals fed MPSe1 compared with animals fed MP-Cont.

Effects of dietary selenium intake on apoptosis. AARGC was
significantly increased in the distal colon of animals fed MPSe1,
compared with those of MP-Cont (Fig. 2A). AARGC was also
significantly increased in animals fed CasYSe4 relative to those of
Cas-Cont. However, although animals that were fed CasYSe1 showed
a trend to increased AARGC, it was not significant compared with
animals fed Cas-Cont.
Although dietary selenium intake as MPSe1 or CasYSe4
significantly increased AARGC in the short-term study, it did not
affect the baseline apoptosis rate in normal epithelium in
experiment 2 (Fig. 2B).
Effects of dietary selenium intake on colonic epithelial
proliferation. In the short-term study, Ki-67 index in colonic
crypts was not significantly affected (Fig. 2C). However, significant
inhibition of proliferation was seen after 12 weeks of feeding
MPSe1 or CasYSe 4 (Fig. 2D), compared with their respective
control diets (MP-Cont or Cas-Cont).
Effect of dietary selenium intake on ACF formation. ACF
were observed predominantly in the distal colon. Results are shown
in Table 2 for ACF number, crypt multiplicity, and the occasional
macroscopic tumor. Animals fed MPSe1 had significantly lower
numbers of small, large, and total ACF, compared with animals fed
MP-Cont. There was no significant difference in ACF formation
between the animals fed CasYSe1 and those fed Cas-Cont. However,
CasYSe4 significantly suppressed the number of large ACF but not
that of small ACF or total ACF regardless of size. Importantly,
MPSe1 significantly reduced all measures of ACF compared with
CasYSe1.
Although ACF was the main end point in this study, macroscopic
tumors were also observed in several animals fed control diets
(MP-Cont or Cas-Cont) and yeast-selenium diets (CasYSe1 or
CasYSe4), but no macroscopic tumors were observed in animals
fed dairy-selenium diet (MPSe1). Statistical analysis was not
undertaken for tumor data alone due to the small numbers;
however, statistical analysis was performed after pooling large ACF

and tumors (Table 2), and statistically significant differences
remained as observed for large ACF alone.
Effect of dietary selenium intake on K-ras mutation. The
effect of selenium intake on K-ras mutation in ACF is summarized
in Table 2. Real-time PCR with LNA and specific fluorescent-labeled
probes enabled identification of the K-ras mutations from the wildtype genome through different melting peaks. The melting
temperature was 67jC F 0.29jC for wild-type DNA, 72.5jC F
0.42jC for TGT mutation, and 73jC F 0.35jC for TGT mutation
(Fig. 3). In this study, both G to A transition and G to T transversion
mutations were detected in ACF, which differs from reports that
only G-A transition mutation are detected in mouse (33–35). K-ras
mutations were significantly reduced in animals fed MPSe1 but not
in animals fed CasYSe1 and CasYSe4.
Effect of dietary selenium intake on tumor and cancer
formation. The effect of selenium on macroscopic tumors
(adenomas and adenocarcinomas) in the longest-term study was
similar to that on ACF. Results summarized in Table 3 show
animals fed MPSe1 had significantly lower colon tumor incidence,
tumor multiplicity, and tumor size, compared with animals fed MPCont or CasYSe1. The percentage inhibition of tumor incidence,
multiplicity, and size was 65.5%, 77.6%, and 73.2% versus MP-Cont,
and 67.3%, 82.4%, and 77.3% versus CasYSe1. Those fed dairyselenium diet at selenium 0.5 ppm (MPSe0.5) also showed a trend
to protection relative to MP-Cont. Despite protection against large

ACF formation, CasYSe4 did not significantly affect tumor
incidence, multiplicity, or size, compared with animals fed
Cas-Cont, nor did CasYSe1.
Comparison of MPSe1 and CasSe1 on tumor end points using twoway factorial Poisson models with an interaction between selenium
sources, and protein type showed that the dairy-selenium significantly reduced tumor incidence (odds ratio, 0.291; P = 0.048) and
tumor multiplicity (odds ratio, 0.267; P = 0.021) with a trend to
reduced tumor size (P = 0.065). Protein type was not significant in
this analysis, although there was a significant interaction between
selenium and milk proteins with tumor multiplicity as the end point.
Analysis of the effect of selenium-containing diets on cancer
formation specifically was performed after histopathologic examination of tumors (Table 3). Results trended in the same direction
as for all macroscopic tumors regardless of whether or not invasion
was present; for instance, cancer incidence fell from 19.2% or 22.2%
in animals fed MP-Cont or CasYSe1 to 3.3% in those fed MPSe1, but
numbers were small and the results did not reach significance.

Discussion
The results of this study provide evidence that a dairy source of
selenium (Tatura-Bio Se) is effective in enhancing AARGC, and in
reducing azoxymethane-induced ACF, cancers and frequency of
K-ras mutations. Our results are consistent with previously

in codon 12 by LNA-mediated real-time
PCR clamping. In melting curve analysis,
wild-type and mutant K-ras can be
discriminated through different melting
peaks at 67jC F 0.29jC (A, wild-type ),
72.5jC F 0.42jC (B, GAT mutation),
and 73jC F 0.35jC (C, TGT mutation).
Sequence analysis of wild-type DNA (A ),

significant differences are identified.

reported evidence that higher selenium intakes provide greater
protection against colon tumor formation, but they also show that
efficacy depends on the dietary source of selenium. Furthermore,
the effect on each of these end points is significantly greater
than with an equivalent selenium dose when fed as selenized-yeast
(Sel-Plex). As the dairy-selenium at an equivalent dose, 1 ppm,
achieved a significantly higher plasma selenium concentration than
the yeast-selenium, the greater anticarcinogenic effect is likely to
be due, at least in part, to higher selenium bioavailability but also
perhaps to differences between the sources in the nature of their
selenium compounds.
Selenium-enriched milk protein isolate was provided at 1 ppm in
the diet so as to maintain a constant dietary protein content of
20%. We found that MPSe1 not only inhibited development of all
sizes and total numbers of ACF but also significantly suppressed all
measures (incidence, multiplicity, and size) of tumor formation
including adenocarcinomas (cancers); selenized-yeast at an equivalent amount (CasYSe1) did not. A higher dose of CasYSe4
significantly inhibited formation of large ACF but not other
measures of ACF or any measure of tumor formation including
cancer. Given dairy-selenium at 1 ppm significantly suppressed
ACF, we also used it at 0.5 ppm selenium in the tumor study. A
trend to protection was seen at 0.5 ppm indicating a proportionate
reduction in tumors. Significant reductions in tumors and cancers
were seen at 1 ppm, which indicates the highly effective effect of
this dose (10-fold above control) and form. A recent selenium/
colon cancer study in rats observed a 45% reduction in tumor
burden when they were fed 8 ppm selenium as yeast, but at that
level of selenium intake, side effects were observed, including an
11% weight loss (30). Earlier studies in rodent models of CRC
showed that selenium in inorganic form (selenite) was effective at
suppressing oncogenesis in concentrations ranging from 1 to 4
ppm (36). Selenium-enriched broccoli or wheat at 2 ppm selenium
were also effective at reducing ACF (37). Our study indicates that
selenium provided as selenium-enriched milk protein isolate is
highly effective at the lowest dose in this range. As such, it seems
likely to be a highly effective source of selenium for cancer
prevention.
Possible chemopreventive mechanisms of selenium include
effects on some key cellular events of oncogenesis, such as

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

apoptosis and/or cell proliferation (15). It has been shown that
there is a correlation between the effectiveness of selenium as a
chemopreventive agent and its ability to inhibit cell growth (38, 39).
In this study, we hypothesized that selenium intake exerts its
anticarcinogenic effect by enhancing the acute apoptotic response
to carcinogen-induced DNA damage (AARGC). This is an
important mechanism for removing cells harboring oncogenic
DNA adducts and is a regulatory target for a variety of dietary
agents and drugs (22, 23, 25–27, 40). We found that AARGC in the
colon was significantly enhanced in animals fed MPSe1 and
CasYSe4 but not in animals fed CasYSe1. This suggests that
selenium may exert a significant proapoptotic effect early in
oncogenesis, which protects against persistence of mutations and
progression to ACF and eventually cancer. This concept is
supported by the observation that specific mutations in K-ras
were significantly reduced in mice fed MPSe1.
It is also possible that selenium intake has a continuing effect
throughout the process of oncogenesis because it also suppressed
cell proliferation. Progression to and beyond the ACF stage might
be regulated in part by epithelial proliferation. This study provided
evidence of selenium affecting cell proliferation because Ki-67
labeling index in colonic crypts was significantly reduced in
animals fed MPSe1 and CasYSe4 after feeding for 12 weeks. Given
that selenium-enriched milk protein isolate was effective at
reducing all sizes of ACF, it is possible that it acts at both
initiation and postinitiation stages of azoxymethane-induced
carcinogenesis and by a number of different mechanisms that
may operate simultaneously or consecutively. Recent cDNA
microarray technology has identified the potential seleniumresponsive genes that might associate with selenium-induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis (41), such as Apo-3, c-jun, and cdk5/
cyclin D1.
A study in our laboratory has shown that the time course of
induction of AARGC in the colon by azoxymethane (0–72 hours)
parallels O6-MeG adduct formation.3 One likely important function
of enhanced AARGC is to remove cells harboring oncogenic DNA

Selenium and Azoxymethane-Induced Colon Cancer Model

adducts and so inhibit accumulation of consequent K-ras
mutations. Therefore, we examined the effect of dietary selenium
on K-ras mutations because these will reflect the overall burden of
unrepaired adducts and so provide further insights into the
mechanisms of cancer prevention. We found azoxymethane-treated
mice developed not only G to A transition mutation as previously
reported (33–35) but also G to T transversion mutation. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to show that G to T mutation
occurs in the mouse azoxymethane model. In addition, we found a
much higher K-ras mutation rate than others (33–35). It is not clear
why there is a striking difference in terms of mouse K-ras mutation
spectrum and frequency between our study and others. The highly
sensitive PCR technology used (LNA-mediated real-time PCR
clumping) may improve the detection of G to T mutation. In
addition, the mutation spectrum may differ across species. For
example, azoxymethane in rats induces G to A mutation exclusively
(42). Furthermore, G to T base substitution is also a preferential
target for other methylating carcinogens such as tobacco-specific
nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (43).
By measuring the frequency of both types of K-ras mutations, we
found that animals fed MPSe1 had a significantly lower frequency
than those fed MP-Cont or CasYSe1. This confirms that K-ras
mutations may be a useful biomarker for chemoprevention.
There has been considerable interest in whether the cancer
chemopreventive effect of selenium is mediated through selenoproteins, such as GPx isoforms. GPx acts as an antioxidant to
eliminate tumor-promoting reactive oxygen species and seems
responsive to dietary selenium intake (44). But GPx induction by
selenium has been challenged as the prime mechanism of chemoprevention because GPx activity is saturated at a lower dietary
selenium intake than that which shows maximum chemopreventive
effect of selenium (45). As cGPx is the most active and abundant
isoform, we measured it in this study. Our study showed a
disconnect between GPx activity and protection. Although significantly higher GPx activity was found in animals fed yeast-selenium
at 1 ppm, increasing intake to 4 ppm did not increase GPx activity
further but did lead to suppression of large ACF. Furthermore,
dairy-selenium at 1 ppm showed stronger protection against ACF
formation and cancer without significantly affecting GPx activity.
These findings confirm that an effect of selenium on GPx activity is
not crucial for cancer protection and, as such, effects on GPx do not
serve as a reliable biomarker. Ganther (46) and others have
previously thrown doubt on the GPx hypothesis and have examined
a possible role for alternative selenium-containing proteins. It is
possible that proteins, such as gastrointestinal GPx (GI-GPx) and
selenoprotein-P (SelP) or thioredoxin reductases (TrxR), or nonselenoprotein selenium metabolites, are responsible for the cancer
preventive action of selenium (46–48). Future studies are needed to
understand the differential effect of the various dietary sources of
selenium on GI-GPx, SelP, and TrxR.
When comparing the two selenium sources at equivalent dose
(1 ppm), dairy-selenium induced a significantly higher plasma

selenium concentration, suggesting that greater bioavailability of
selenium is the explanation if bioavailability is accurately reflected
in plasma levels. However, yeast-selenium at 4 ppm produced even
higher plasma levels than did dairy-selenium at 1 ppm but failed to
achieve protection. It is well-known that selenium compounds may
differ in type between different food sources, and these could alter
efficacy as chemopreventives (49). The milk proteins will not
contain low molecular weight (MW) selenium compounds due to
the preparative procedure, and any selenocysteine or selenomethionine present will be incorporated into proteins. Further
research is warranted to identify the organic forms present within
the milk proteins, how they differ from yeast, and their relative
chemopreventive actions. It is interesting that the milk protein
isolate was protective at 0.5 (trend) or 1 ppm (significant), when
compared with the results published on several low MW selenium
compounds in the mammary cancer model (50). That review
reported 50% reduction in mammary tumors at 2 ppm or greater
for all the compounds examined except the garlic compound,
selenium-allylselenocysteine, which was effective at 1 ppm. Our
data suggest that the dairy protein product is at least as protective
as other selenium compounds tested. This warrants further study,
including determination of what selenium compounds are released
in the gut during digestion and absorption of selenoproteins.
In conclusion, this study has shown a significant difference
between dietary sources of selenium in their capacity to inhibit
events in colorectal oncogenesis at equivalent selenium concentration. A selenium-enriched milk protein isolate is more effective
than a selenized-yeast. The dairy source of selenium had higher
bioavailability than the yeast source, although it seems likely that
differences in the molecular forms of selenium also contributed
to the differences in protection. Inhibition of oncogenesis by dairyselenium was likely to have been a consequence of reduction in
the effect of azoxymethane-induced DNA lesions resulting from
enhanced AARGC, reduction in frequency of K-ras mutations,
and inhibition of cell proliferation. Supplementation of selenium
via dairy products might be a practical and effective approach
to increasing human selenium intake and preventing cancers such
as CRC.
