ABSTRACT:
Translation initiation plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and
tumorigenesis. We report here that inhibiting translation initiation through induction
of eIF2α phosphorylation by small-molecular-weight compounds restricts the
availability of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary complex and abrogates the proliferation
of cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Restricting the availability of the
ternary complex preferentially down-regulates the expression of growth-promoting
proteins and up-regulates the expression of ER stress response genes in cancer cells
as well as in tumors excised from either animal models of human cancer or cancer
patients. These findings provide the first direct evidence for translational control
of gene-specific expression by small molecules in vivo and indicate that translation
initiation factors are bona fide targets for development of mechanism-specific anticancer agents.

INTRODUCTION

vivo has not been demonstrated. The studies reported here
were designed to determine whether the eIF2.GTP.MettRNAi translation initiation (ternary) complex is a bona
fide target for the development of anti-cancer therapeutic
agents.
Formation of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary
complex is the first critical step in the translation
initiation cascade. Upon assembly of the 80S ribosome
at the initiation codon, GTP in the ternary complex is
hydrolyzed, releasing the eIF2.GDP binary complex [14].
To initiate a new round of translation, eIF2.GDP must
be converted to eIF2.GTP by eIF2B, the eIF2 guanine
nucleotide exchange factor. Phosphorylation of the alpha
subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) on S51 increases the affinity of
eIF2 for eIF2B and functionally converts eIF2 into a
competitive inhibitor of eIF2B[15]. Because of the low
eIF2B/eIF2 ratio, even partial phosphorylation of eIF2α
limits the amount of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary
complex and thereby inhibits translation initiation [16].
Restriction of the ternary complex by
phosphorylation of eIF2α plays a critical role in the
translational regulation of specific genes or gene

Translation initiation plays a critical role in both
general and gene-specific regulation of gene expression
and thereby in the control of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and survival. Unrestricted translation
initiation causes malignant transformation in vitro and
likely plays a causative role in the genesis of some human
cancers [1-3]. Consistently, translation initiation factors
are over-expressed or otherwise activated in breast,
lung, cervical, and hematologic cancers and predict
poor prognosis [4-9]. In contrast, restricting translation
initiation reverses transformed phenotypes in vitro and
in vivo [10-13]. This experimental and clinical evidence
indicates that translation initiation factors are potential
targets for the development of mechanism-specific anticancer therapies. Indeed, an anti-sense oligonucleotidebased therapy targeting eukaryotic translation initiation
factor (eIF) 4E inhibits tumor growth in animal models
of cancer and has recently been evaluated in a phaseI-II human clinical trial[11]. However, whether small
molecules can effectively target translation initiation in

clusters [17-22]. For example, the translation of mRNAs
containing excessive and stable secondary structures,
like those encoding for most oncogenic proteins, is
preferentially down-regulated by phosphorylation of eIF2α
at levels that would minimally affect translation of most
housekeeping proteins encoded by mRNAs with simple
5’UTRs [23-29]. Paradoxically, the translation of a subset
of mRNAs with particular features in their 5’UTRs, like
the one coding for activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), is more efficient under conditions that limit the amount
of the ternary complex [30, 31]. Increased translation of
ATF-4 results in the transcriptional activation of its target
genes including the chaperone BiP and the pro-apoptotic
transcription factor CHOP [32].
We previously identified three chemically distinct
small molecular weight compounds, Clotrimazole (CLT),
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and troglitazone (TRO),
that cause phosphorylation of eIF2α in non-transformed
cell lines [18, 20, 22, 33]. We used these compounds as
molecular probes to determine whether restriction of the
ternary complex via phosphorylation of eIF2α can be
achieved pharmacologically for cancer treatment.
We report here that CLT, EPA, and TRO cause
phosphorylation of eIF2α, restrict the amount of the
ternary complex, and thereby inhibit translation initiation
in a wide variety of cancer cell lines. In experimental
cancer models, the compounds abrogate xenograft tumor
growth and increase the mean survival time of p53www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mice. Abrogation of tumor growth is associated with
phosphorylation of eIF2α, reduced availability of the
ternary complex, down-regulation of oncogenes, and upregulation of ATF-4-dependent genes. Importantly, we
show that administration of TRO to liposarcoma patients
caused phosphorylation of eIF2α and increased expression
of the ATF-4-dependent protein BiP. These findings
provide the first direct in vivo evidence that the ternary
complex can be pharmacologically targeted for cancer
therapy.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
CLT, EPA, and TRO inhibit cancer cell
proliferation.
We determined the effect of CLT, EPA, and TRO
on the proliferation and/or survival of cancer cell lines by
sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay (SRB). Table 1
presents the IC50 of each compound for the cancer cell
lines tested. The three molecular probes inhibited in a
dose-dependent manner the proliferation of a wide variety
of cancer cell lines, including several multiple drugresistant ones.

translation initiation [16, 20, 22]. To determine whether
inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by CLT, EPA, and
TRO is mediated by their effect on intracellular Ca++
homeostasis, we measured cytosolic Ca++ in Fura-2–
loaded cancer cells. Table 1 shows that in most cancer
cells, particularly those sensitive to their anti-proliferative
effect, CLT, EPA, and TRO released Ca++ from internal
stores – as indicated by an increased cytosolic Ca++ in
Ca++-free media. To determine whether CLT, EPA, and

We have previously reported that in NIH 3T3
cells, CLT, EPA, and TRO release Ca++ from internal
stores and simultaneously inhibit their refilling through
store-operated Ca++ channels (SOC) [18, 20, 22, 33].
This causes phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibition of

assay as in B. E) A single nucleotide was inserted into the second uORF of the ATF-4 5’UTR, which eliminated the ORF2. Cells transfected
with this mutant construct were treated with CLT, EPA, or TRO, as in 2B.

* KLN cells transiently transfected with either GFP-eIF2α-51A (A, B) or GFP-eIF2α-WT (C,
D) were treated with CLT, EPA, or TRO, sequentially fixed with 3% paraformaldhyde and
70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and cell cycle distribution of GFP-expressing
cells was determined by FACS analysis.

TRO inhibit SOC in cancer cells, we first challenged Fura2–loaded cancer cells with thapsigargin (TG), a specific
inhibitor of SERCA-ATPase [34, 35]. Treatment with TG
in media containing Ca++ results in sustained elevation of
cytosolic Ca++, a functional expression of capacitative Ca++
influx through SOC. Addition of CLT, EPA, or TRO after
TG closes SOC in most cancer cell lines, as indicated by
a sharp reduction of cytosolic Ca++ towards the baseline
levels (Table 1). To document directly whether the
compounds release Ca++ from the ER stores, as suggested
by the FURA-2 experiments, we generated stable cell lines
that express calcium-indicator cameleon proteins targeted

to the ER[36]. These experiments formally demonstrate
that CLT, EPA, and TRO partially deplete ER Ca++ stores
(see Supplemental Results and in Supplemental Figure 1A
for details).
Taken together, the data presented in Table 1 and
Supplemental Figure 1A demonstrate that CLT, EPA,
and TRO partially deplete ER- Ca++ stores in a variety of
human cancer cell lines. Because the effect on intracellular
Ca++ was similar in all cancer cell lines sensitive to the
anti-proliferative effect of the compounds, further
mechanistic and in vivo studies were conducted in selected
cancer cell lines.

EPA (B, 50 µM), or TRO (C, 30 µM) for 2 hours, lysed, and an equal amount of OD 260 material was separated by sucrose density gradient
centrifugation. The gradient was eluted from the bottom with constant monitoring at 254 nm.

we developed a quantitative cell-based assay whose readout depends on the availability of this complex. The assay
takes advantage of the striking differential effect that
restriction of the ternary complex exerts on the translation
of mRNAs. In particular, translation of a subset of mRNAs
characterized by the presence of multiple upstream open
reading frames (uORF) in their 5’UTR increases when
the ternary complex is restricted, as characteristically
represented by the mRNA encoding for ATF-4 and GCN2
[32, 37, 38]. Fusion of the 5’ UTR of either mRNA to
a reporter gene confers enhanced translation when the
ternary complex is scarce [32, 38].
Assay development has been described elsewhere
[39, 40]. Briefly, we constructed a bi-directional plasmid
in which a common promoter/enhancer complex drives
the transcription of firefly luciferase (F-luc) ORF fused to
the 5’UTR of ATF-4, and of the renilla luciferase (R-luc)
ORF fused to a simple 90-nucleotide 5’UTR derived
from the plasmid (Figure 2A). The relative expression
of each luciferase was established by the F-luc to R-luc
ratio determined with a dual luciferase assay. In stably
transfected KLN cells, CLT, EPA, or TRO increased the
F-luc to R-luc ratio in a dose-dependent manner without
affecting the ratio of the respective mRNAs (Figures 2B
and 2C). These data indicate that CLT, EPA, and TRO
increase the translation of the reporter F-luc mRNA
fused to the 5’UTR of ATF-4. To establish the causeeffect relationship between phosphorylation of eIF2α
and the increased translation of F-luc mRNA shown

Extensive experimental evidence shows that partial
depletion of ER Ca++ stores induces phosphorylation of
eIF2α [18, 20]. As expected from their effect on ER
Ca++, CLT, EPA, and TRO caused strong phosphorylation
of eIF2α in KLN squamous cell carcinoma cells (Figure
1A), as well as in MCF-7 breast cells and DU145 prostate
cancer cells (data not shown).
To determine the functional consequences of
eIF2α phosphorylation, we took advantage of the welldocumented translational up-regulation of ATF-4 and
consequent induction of ATF-4-responsive genes that
result from eIF2α phosphorylation, which reduces the
amount of eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary complex [32]. As
shown in Figure 1B, CLT, EPA, and TRO strongly induce
the expression of CHOP, a transcriptional target of ATF4. These data suggest that CLT, EPA, and TRO reduce
the amount of the ternary complex and thereby inhibit
translation initiation in cancer cells.

CLT, EPA, and TRO restrict formation of the
ternary complex in vitro and in vivo.
To confirm that CLT, EPA, and TRO restrict the
abundance of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary complex,

in Figure 1, we transiently co-transfected KLN cells
with the bi-directional construct described in Figure
2A and an expression vector coding for either wildtype eIF2α (eIF2α-WT) or a constitutively active nonphosphorylatable eIF2α mutant (eIF2α-S51A). Figure
2D shows that co-transfection with the eIF2α-S51A
mutant abrogated the increase in the F-luc to R-luc ratio
observed in response to CLT, EPA, or TRO, while cotransfection with eIF2α-WT had no effect. Furthermore,
a single nucleotide insertion that removes the second
uORF in the reporter construct abrogated the translational
up-regulation of F-luc induced by these agents (Figure
2E). Abrogation of F-Luc translational up-regulation by
either non-phosphorylatable eIF2α or by deletion of one
uORF demonstrates conclusively that CLT, EPA, or TRO
reduces the availability of the ternary complex by inducing
phosphorylation of eIF2α. Consistently, anti-cancer agents
that do not cause eIF2α phosphorylation failed to upregulate F-luc (see supplementary Table 1).

polysomes and free ribosomal subunits, demonstrating
that the three agents inhibit translation initiation in cancer
cells. This conclusion was confirmed in pulse-labeling
experiments demonstrating that CLT, EPA, and TRO
inhibit protein synthesis in different cancer cell lines
(Supplemental Figure 1B).

CLT-, EPA-, and TRO-induced cell cycle arrest
in cancer cells is mediated by phosphorylation of
eIF2α.
To determine the effect of CLT, EPA, and TRO
on cell cycle progression in cancer cells, we treated
exponentially growing KLN cancer cells with these three
agents, stained them with propidium iodide, and analyzed
them by FACS for cell cycle distribution and apoptosis.
CLT, EPA, and TRO blocked the KLN cancer cell cycle in
G1 with no apparent effect on the proportion of apoptotic
cells (Supplemental Figure 2). This cell cycle arrest is
mediated by phosphorylation of eIF2α on S51, because it
was abrogated in cells transiently transfected with the nonphosphorylatable eIF2α-S51A mutant (Table 2).

CLT, EPA, and TRO inhibit translation initiation.
The results depicted in Figures 1 and 2 strongly
indicate that CLT, EPA, and TRO inhibit translation
initiation in cancer cells, a conclusion that can be tested
experimentally by analyzing polysome profiles of cell
lysates. When translation initiation is inhibited, polysome
profiles shift from heavy toward lighter polysomes. As
shown in Figure 3A-C, the polysome profiles of CLT, EPA,
and TRO-treated KLN cells shifted from heavy to light

DBA/2J mice were injected with 2.5 x 106 KLN cells, the animals were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups after
establishment of tumors and treated with 120 mg/kg/day CLT, or 350 mg/kg/day TRO, both in gum arabica, or EPA (2.5 g/kg, administered
as fish oil concentrate). Gum arabica-treated mice were used as a control for CLT and TRO, and corn oil-treated mice were used as a control
for EPA treatment. The experiments were carried out in pairs (CLT vs. gum arabica, TRO vs. gum arabica, EPA vs. corn oil) with 15 mice
per group. Tumor dimensions were determined with electronic calipers, tumor volume was calculated, and the results were analyzed by
Student’s t-test. B). Male nude mice were injected with 1x106 human DU145 prostate cancer cells, and mice with visible tumors were fed

we implanted KLN cells intradermally in mice to form
orthotopic-syngenic tumors. Mice carrying small (2-4 mm
in diameter) KLN tumors were treated for either one or
seven days orally with CLT (120 mg/kg), EPA (2.5 g/kg),
TRO (350 mg/kg), or the respective vehicles. Staining of
excised tumors with anti-PS51-eIF2α−specific antibodies
showed that all three agents induced significant and
sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α, providing the first
experimental evidence that phosphorylation of eIF2α
in tumors can be achieved pharmacologically (Figure
4). Consistently, in tumors from treated animals, all
three agents increased the expression of BiP, another
ATF-4 dependent surrogate marker for depletion of
the ternary complex that is induced by phosphorylation
of eIF2α[30-32, 41]. CLT, EPA, and TRO also downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 in the tumors
excised from treated mice (Figure 4). This finding is
consistent with depletion of the ternary complex, which
preferentially affects translation of mRNAs containing
highly structured 5’UTRs, including those encoding for
most oncogenic proteins such as cyclin D1[18, 20, 22,
42]. To confirm restriction of the ternary complex in
the tumors, we injected mice intradermically with the
engineered KLN cells shown in Figure 2B and treated
tumor-bearing mice with CLT (120 mg/kg/day) or
vehicle for two days. Supplemental Figure 3 shows that
CLT significantly increased the F-luc to R-luc ratio in
the tumors from CLT-treated mice. Taken together, the
experiments described above demonstrate that restriction
of the ternary complex and inhibition of translation
initiation in tumors can be pharmacologically achieved.

To determine the functional consequence of
reducing the amount of the ternary complex in tumors,
we treated KLN-cell tumor-bearing mice orally with
CLT (120 mg/kg), EPA (2.5 g/kg), or TRO (350 mg/
kg) daily for 5 weeks. Control mice for CLT or TRO
received gum arabica (the vehicle used to dissolve the
drugs), while control mice for EPA received equicaloric
amounts of corn oil. As shown in Figure 5A, CLT, EPA,
and TRO significantly reduced the growth of KLN cell
tumors, demonstrating that phosphorylation of eIF2α
and restriction of the ternary complex is associated with
inhibition of tumor growth.
The observation that EPA induces phosphorylation
of eIF2α and inhibition of KLN-tumor growth in vivo
is remarkable and has major public health implications,
because EPA, the main n-3 fatty acid in marine fish oil,
is a component of the human diet. Indeed, some human
population studies suggest that consumption of diets rich
in EPA may reduce cancer risk [43-45]. For this reason,
we probed further the effect of EPA on tumor growth
and progression in a DU-145 human prostate cancer
xenograft and in a genetically engineered p53-/- mouse
cancer model. Treatment with EPA significantly reduced
the growth of DU-145 human prostate cancer xenograft
tumors (Figure 5B). In p53-/- mice, oral administration of
EPA significantly extended the mean survival time from
185 to 360 days (p<0.005, Figure 5C). This experiment is
remarkable, because p53 is the most commonly mutated
or deleted gene in human cancers, and p53-/- mice develop

METHODS
Ethics Statement.

While this work was in progress, we became aware
of a clinical trial in which TRO was administered to
liposarcoma patients between a diagnostic biopsy and the
surgical excision of the tumor [46]. We obtained paraffinembedded pathology samples from these patients and
stained them with anti-PS51-eIF2α- and BiP-specific
antibodies. Figure 6 shows that treatment with TRO
caused a remarkable increase in eIF2α phosphorylation
and BiP expression in the excised human liposarcoma
tumors compared with the pre-treatment biopsy.
Clinical and experimental studies indicate that
dysregulation of translation initiation plays a role
in malignant transformation and tumor progression,
highlighting the potential of therapeutics that exert
antitumor and/or chemopreventive effects by selectively
targeting the translation initiation cascade[1, 4749]. The findings reported in this manuscript provide
conclusive evidence that translation initiation can be
pharmacologically targeted in vivo with small molecules,
a critical prerequisite for the development of translation
initiation-specific anti-cancer agents. Specifically,
we demonstrate that 1) pharmacological agents that
induce phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduce the ternary
complex in vitro similarly phosphorylate eIF2α and
reduce the ternary complex in animal and human tumors,
and 2) phosphorylation of eIF2α in vivo is associated
with suppression of tumor growth and extension of life
expectancy in various animal cancer models. Direct in
vivo demonstration of the cause-effect relationship studies
between induction of eIF2α phosphorylation and tumor
by replacing endogenous eIF2α with recombinant eIF2αS51A mutant could not be carried out despite our attempts
because tumors formed by these cells failed to grow well
after an initial phase. Similar results have been reported
by others [50].
Together, the in vivo experiments depicted in
Figure 5 and 6 indicate that pharmacological inhibition
of translation initiation can be used for cancer treatment
and perhaps prevention in high-risk populations. Second
generation of translation initiation inhibitors being
developed as well as progress in resolving the structure
of translation initiation factors and their regulators should
accelerate development of translation initiation inhibitors
for cancer therapy [39, 51, 52]. Furthermore, since EPA
is the main component of marine fish oils and can be
readily administered to humans with minimal or no side
effects, our studies provide a strong favorable rationale
and the analytical tools for human clinical trials aimed at
evaluating whether translation initiation inhibitors that
induce phosphorylation of eIF2α would reduce either

lines expressing ER-targeted cameleon proteins [36, 54]
and monitored ER Ca++ using the PTI dual-wavelength
spectrofluorometer.

Polysome profiles.
Polysome profiles were obtained by sucrose density
gradient centrifugation as described in[55].

or breathing difficulties or lost more than 15% of body
weight or appeared cachectic. In all other studies, animals
were maintained for total of four weeks after the start of
treatment. They were observed at least three times a week,
any animal that had tumor volume greater than 15% of
body weight or lost 15% body weight or had breathing or
locomotion difficulties or other signs of pain or suffering
per approved protocol were sacrificed. All animals were
given analgesic (bprunex) as needed.

Cells were seeded at the density of 105 in 60-mm
(stable transfection) or 106 cells per 150-mm (transient
transfection) plates and transfected one day later using
the Qiagen transfectamine transfection kit. For selection
of stable cell lines, transfected cells were transferred to
100-mm plates and selected with appropriate antibiotics.

Cell cycle analysis.

Immunocytochemistry.

Untransfected KLN cells were fixed with ethanol
(70%), stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml PI with
20 µg/ml RNAse A) for 30 minutes, and analyzed by
FACS[56]. Cells transiently transfected with GFP-eIF2α51A or eIF2α-WT were fixed with 3% paraformaldhyde,
washed twice with PBS, fixed again with 70% methanol,
and stained with PI as described above. Cell cycle
distribution of GFP-expressing cells was analyzed by
FACS.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections
were immunostained with anti-PS51-eIF2α, anti-BiP, and
anti-cyclin D1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), and counter-stained with hematoxylin.

Dual luciferase assay.
Cells or minced tumors expressing F-luc and R-luc
were lysed and the extracts assayed with a glow-type dual
luciferase assay kit, (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI).

Western blotting.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and
probed with anti-phosphoserine-51-eIF2α (PS51-eIF2α),
anti-total eIF2α-specific antibodies (PS51-eIF2α)
(Biosource International, Hopkinton, MA), anti-CHOP, or
anti β-actin as described [56].

Animal studies.
KLN squamous cell carcinoma cells were injected
intradermically (2.5 x 105 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS) into
6-week-old female DBA/2J mice (Jackson Laboratories,
Bar Harbor, ME). Four days after implantation, tumorbearing mice were randomized into control and treatment
groups and then treated with the vehicle or CLT (120 mg/
kg in gum arabica), TRO (400 mg/kg in gum arabica), or
EPA (2.5 g/kg, lipid concentrate) daily by gavage. Control
mice were treated with the respective vehicle alone. Tumor
volumes were calculated as in [20] and results analyzed
by Student’s t-test. DU145 human prostate cancer cells
were subcutaneously injected to nude mice that were fed
a diet containing either 20% corn oil or 1% corn oil and
19% menhaden oil, starting five days after inoculation of
tumors. Tumor volumes were calculated[20] and results
analyzed by Student’s t-test. p53-/- mice were administered
either EPA (2.5 g/kg in fish oil refined for high content
of EPA) or equicaloric corn oil daily by gavage until the
death of the last animal. Life expectancies of control and
EPA-treated mice were compared by Kaplan-Meyer test.
The end point in studies with p53-/- and p53+/+
was lifespan. Animals were observed daily and weighed
twice weekly. They were sacrificed in they had locomotion
