Abstract
Pancreatic cancers generally respond poorly to chemotherapy, prompting a need to identify agents that
could sensitize tumors to treatment. In this study, we investigated the response of human pancreatic cells to
γ-tocotrienol (γ-T3), a novel, unsaturated form of vitamin E found in palm oil and rice bran oil, to determine
whether it could potentiate the effects of gemcitabine, a standard of care in clinical treatment of pancreatic
cancer. γ-T3 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines with variable p53 status and
potentiated gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. These effects correlated with an inhibition of NF-κB activation
by γ-T3 and a suppression of key cellular regulators including cyclin D1, c-Myc, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
Bcl-2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ICAM-1, and
CXCR4. In an orthotopic nude mouse model of human pancreatic cancer, p.o. administration of γ-T3 inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor properties of gemcitabine. Immunohistochemical analysis
indicated a correlation between tumor growth inhibition and reduced expression of Ki-67, COX-2, matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), NF-κB p65, and VEGF in the tissue. Combination treatment also downregulated NF-κB activity along with the NF-κB–regulated gene products, such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, VEGF, MMP-9,
and CXCR4. Consistent with an enhancement of tumor apoptosis, caspase activation was observed in tumor
tissues. Overall, our findings suggest that γ-T3 can inhibit the growth of human pancreatic tumors and sensitize them to gemcitabine by suppressing NF-κB–mediated inflammatory pathways linked to tumorigenesis.

Introduction
The National Cancer Institute estimated that 18,770 men
and 18,030 women in the United States would die of pancreatic cancer in 2010 (1). The only agents approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to treat pancreatic cancer are
gemcitabine and erlotinib, both of which produce responses
in <10% of patients and are associated with multiple adverse
events and drug resistance. Therefore, the need for novel
strategies to treat this lethal disease is imperative.
The transcription factor NF-κB has been linked with cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, antiapoptosis,

and chemoresistance in multiple tumors (2, 3). In addition,
numerous lines of evidence suggest that NF-κB plays a major
role in the growth and chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer.
NF-κB is constitutively active in pancreatic cancer cells (4)
but not in immortalized, nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal
epithelial cells (5). Thus, NF-κB activation has been reported
in animal models of pancreatic cancer (6) and in human pancreatic cancer tissue (4). NF-κB promotes pancreatic cancer
growth via antiapoptosis (4, 7) and mediates the induction of
mitogenic gene products, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 (8),
the latter of which is overexpressed in human pancreatic
cancer tissue and inversely correlated with patient survival
(9). Additionally, NF-κB enhances the angiogenic potential
of pancreatic cancer cells via increased expression of proangiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; ref. 10), whereas other NF-κB–regulated gene products promote the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells (11). Finally, NF-κB plays a pivotal role in promoting
gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer (3). Together,
this evidence implicates NF-κB in pancreatic cancer and suggests that agents that block NF-κB activation could reduce
chemoresistance of the cells to gemcitabine and perhaps
be used in combination with gemcitabine as a novel therapeutic regimen for pancreatic cancer.

Vitamin E, as represented by tocopherols, was first discovered in 1922 (12). Tocotrienols, unsaturated derivatives of
vitamin E found in rice, barley, oats, and palm, were first
identified in 1965 and first found to prevent cancer in 1989
(13). Although tocopherols have been studied extensively
(over 30,000 citations), very little is known about tocotrienols. Limited studies have revealed that tocotrienols are
more potent antioxidant agents than tocopherols (14) and
exhibit activities superior to those of tocopherols. For
instance, studies from our laboratory and others have shown
that γ-tocotrienol (γ-T3), but not tocopherol, can inhibit
both constitutive and inducible NF-κB activation in various
cancer cell lines (15, 16). This activity correlated with downregulation of the NF-κB–regulated gene products associated
with survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis (16).
Tocotrienols have been shown to suppress the in vitro proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells, including human
breast, colon, prostate, and pancreatic (12, 17). γ-T3 has been
reported to potentiate the effect of gefitinib, celecoxib, and
statins against various human cancers (12, 18–20). This
dietary agent can also inhibit ErbB3-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt mitogenic signaling in cancer cells
(21). Moreover, tocotrienols have been shown to inhibit
angiogenesis (22, 23) by suppressing hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α (24) and to inhibit proinflammatory markers and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in vitro (25). Other
studies have shown that γ-T3 inhibits human cancer cell
progression by downregulating cyclin D1 and E (26). Recent
studies have shown that tocotrienols can suppress the proliferation of various human pancreatic cancer cells (17) and,
when given p.o. to mice, significant levels accumulate in
the pancreatic tissues. Another recent study indicate that
γ-T3 can sensitize androgen-independent prostate cancer
to docetaxel in vivo through downregulation of proliferating
cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67 and Id1, and upregulation of
cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (27).
The possibility that dietary agents can potentiate the
effects of chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine is
an attractive strategy. In the present study, we investigated
whether γ-T3 could sensitize human pancreatic tumors to
gemcitabine in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model.
We showed that γ-T3 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of
various pancreatic cancer cells, enhanced gemcitabineinduced apoptosis, and potentiated the antitumor activity
of gemcitabine against orthotopically implanted human
pancreatic tumors through the downregulation of NF-κB
and NF-κB–regulated gene products.

γT3 Potentiates Gemcitabine Effect in Pancreatic Cancer

cells (2,000 per well) were incubated with γ-T3 in triplicate in
a 96-well plate and then incubated for 2, 4, or 6 days at 37°C.
A MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for
2 hours at 37°C. An extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50%
dimethylformamide) was added, and the cells were incubated
overnight at 37°C. The absorbance of the cell suspension was
measured at 570 nm with an MRX Revelation 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies).
Apoptosis assay
To investigate whether γ-T3 could potentiate the apoptotic effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells,
we used a LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay kit (Invitrogen),
which is used to determine intracellular esterase activity
and plasma membrane integrity. This assay uses calcein,
a polyanionic, green fluorescent dye that is retained within
live cells, and a red fluorescent ethidium homodimer dye
that can enter cells through damaged membranes and
bind to nucleic acids but is excluded by the intact plasma
membranes of live cells (29). Briefly, cells (5,000 per well)
were incubated in chamber slides, pretreated with γ-T3 for
4 hours, and treated with gemcitabine for 24 hours. Cells
were then stained with the assay reagents for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Cell viability was determined under
a fluorescence microscope by counting live (green) and
dead (red) cells.
Animals
Male athymic nu/nu mice (4 weeks old) were obtained
from the breeding colony of the Department of Experimental
Radiation Oncology at University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center. The animals were housed in standard plexiglass cages (five per cage) in a room maintained at constant
temperature and humidity and in a 12-hour light/12-hour
dark cycle. Their diet consisted of regular autoclave chow
and water ad libitum. None of the mice exhibited any
lesions, and all were tested pathogen free. Before initiating
the experiment, we acclimatized all of the mice to a pulverized diet for 3 days. Our experimental protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center.
Orthotopic implantation of MIA PaCa-2 cells
MIA PaCa-2 cells were stably transfected with luciferase as
previously described for PANC-1 cells (30). The MIA PaCa-2
cells were orthotopically implanted as described previously
(29). Briefly, luciferase-transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells were
harvested from subconfluent cultures after a brief exposure
to 0.25% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA. Trypsinization was
stopped with medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were
washed once in serum-free medium and resuspended in
PBS. Only suspensions consisting of single cells, with
>90% viability, were used for the injections. After mice
were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine solution, a small
incision was made in the left abdominal flank, and MIA
PaCa-2 cells (1 × 106) in 100 μL PBS were injected into
the subcapsular region of the pancreas with a 27-gauge

www.aacrjournals.org

needle and a calibrated push button–controlled dispensing
device (Hamilton Syringe Co.). A cotton swab was held
cautiously for 1 minute over the site of injection to prevent
leakage. The abdominal wound was closed in one layer
with wound clips (Braintree Scientific, Inc.).
Experimental protocol
One week after implantation, the mice were randomized
into the following treatment groups (n = 6 per group) based
on the bioluminescence first measured with an in vivo imaging system (IVIS 200, Xenogen Corp.): (a) untreated control
(olive oil, 100 μL daily), (b) tocotrienol (400 mg/kg once daily
p.o.), (c) gemcitabine alone (25 mg/kg twice weekly by i.p.
injection), and (d) combination (tocotrienol, 400 mg/kg once
daily p.o., and gemcitabine, 25 mg/kg twice weekly by i.p.
injection). Tumor volumes were monitored weekly with the
bioluminescence IVIS, which includes a cryogenic cooling
unit, and a data acquisition computer running Living Image
software (Xenogen Corp.). Before imaging, the animals were
anesthetized in an acrylic chamber with 2.5% isoflurane/air
mixture and injected i.p. with 40 mg/mL D-luciferin potassium
salt in PBS at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. After
10 minutes of incubation with luciferin, each mouse was
placed in a right lateral decubitus position and a digital
grayscale animal image was acquired, followed by the acquisition and overlay of a pseudocolor image representing the
spatial distribution of detected photons emerging from active luciferase within the animal. Signal intensity was quantified as the sum of all detected photons within the region of
interest per second. The mice were subjected to imaging on
days 0, 7, 17, 24, and 29 of treatment. Therapy was continued for 4 weeks, and the animals were euthanized 1 week
later. Primary tumors in the pancreas were excised, and
the final tumor volume was measured as V = 2/3πr3, where
r is the mean of the three dimensions (length, width, and
depth). Half of the tumor tissue was fixed in formalin and
embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and routine H&E staining. The other half was snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80°C. H&E staining confirmed the
presence of tumor(s) in each pancreas.
Preparation of nuclear extract from tumor samples
Pancreatic tumor tissues (75–100 mg/mouse) from mice
in the control and treatment groups were minced and incubated on ice for 30 minutes in 0.5 mL of ice-cold buffer
A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, and 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)]. The minced tissue was homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at
16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes. The resulting nuclear pellet was suspended in 0.2 mL of buffer B [20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl 2 ,
420 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA,
0.5 mmol/L PMSF, and 2 μg/mL leupeptin] and incubated
on ice for 2 hours with intermittent mixing. The suspension was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 30 minutes. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and
stored at −70°C until used as previously described (28).

Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay
with BSA as the standard.
NF-κB activation in pancreatic cancer cells and
tumor samples
To assess NF-κB activation, we isolated nuclei from pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor samples and carried out
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) essentially as
described previously (29). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared
from pancreatic cancer cells (1 × 106/mL) and tumor samples
were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded
NF-κB oligonucleotide (4 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA)
from the HIV long terminal repeat (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGGGAGGCGTGG-3′;
underline indicates NF-κB–binding sites) for 15 minutes at
37°C. The resulting DNA-protein complex was separated
from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels.
The dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands were
quantitated with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).
Immunolocalization of NF-κB p65, VEGF, and COX-2 in
tumor samples
The nuclear localization of p65 and the expression of COX-2
and VEGF were examined via an immunohistochemical
method described previously (28). Briefly, pancreatic cancer
tumor samples were embedded in paraffin and fixed with
paraformaldehyde. After being washed in PBS, the slides
were blocked with protein block solution (Dako) for 20 minutes and then incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal
anti-human p65, mouse monoclonal anti-human VEGF,
and anti-COX-2 antibodies (1:100, 1:50, and 1:75, respectively). After incubation with the antibodies, the slides were
washed and then incubated with biotinylated link universal
antiserum followed by HRP-streptavidin detection with the
LSAB+ kit (Dako). The slides were rinsed, and color was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride used as a
chromogen. Finally, sections were rinsed in distilled water,
counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, and mounted
with DPX mounting medium (Sigma) for evaluation.
Pictures were captured with a Photometrics CoolSNAP CF
color camera (Nikon) and MetaMorph software version
4.6.5 (Universal Imaging).
Ki-67 immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) were
stained with anti-Ki-67 (rabbit monoclonal clone SP6) antibody as described previously (29). Results were expressed
as the percentage of Ki-67+ cells ± SEM per 40× magnification. A total of ten 40× fields were examined and counted
from three tumors each of the treatment groups.
Western blot analysis
Pancreatic tumor tissues (75–100 mg/mouse) from mice
in the control and treatment groups were minced and incubated on ice for 30 minutes in 0.5 mL of ice-cold wholecell lysate buffer (10% NP40, 5 mol/L NaCl, 1 mol/L HEPES,
0.1 mol/L EGTA, 0.5 mol/L EDTA, 0.1 mol/L PMSF, 0.2 mol/L

sodium orthovanadate, 1 mol/L NaF, 2 μg/mL aprotinin,
and 2 μg/mL leupeptin). The minced tissue was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at
16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes. The proteins were then
fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare).
High-performance liquid chromatography analysis
The extraction of γ-T3 was performed according to the
method described earlier (31). Frozen tissue (100 mg) was
thawed, and 400 μL of ethanol were added and homogenized
for 30 seconds. Next, 500 μL of water were added and homogenized for 15 seconds. And then, 500 μL of hexane were
added and homogenized for 15 seconds. The samples were
centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. The organic
layer was evaporated to dryness under purified air at 40°C.
The pellets were reconstituted with mobile phase and estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC;
Waters separation module Alliance 2695, Waters). Silicabased C18 column and mobile phase that was a mixture of
acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid (10%) in a ratio of 45:45:10,
respectively, were used for separation. Analyses were run at a
flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with the detector operating at wavelength of 291 nm. Tissues from vehicle-fed mice are set as
controls that reflect the baseline.
Statistics
In vitro experiments were repeated twice, and statistical
analysis was performed. The values were initially subjected
to one-way ANOVA, which revealed significant differences
between groups, and then later compared between groups
with an unpaired Student's t test, which revealed significant
differences between two sample means. In vivo experiments
were done as at least three independent assays. The values
were initially subjected to one-way ANOVA and then later
compared among groups with an unpaired Student's t test.

Results
The objective of this study was to (a) determine whether
γ-T3 can inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer
cells, (b) determine whether γ-T3 can enhance the antitumor
effects of gemcitabine in vitro, (c) determine whether γ-T3
can potentiate the effects of a chemotherapeutic agent
in vivo in models of human pancreatic cancer, and (d) investigate the mechanism by which γ-T3 enhances the effects of
the chemotherapeutic agent. We used four different human
pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2,
and PANC-1) of different origin for this investigation. These
cell lines differ with respect to K-Ras and p53 mutations. To
monitor tumor growth in vivo, we used noninvasive imaging
of the luciferase-transfected MIA PaCa-2 cell line.

cells in vitro

of human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, PANC-1,

BxPC-3, and MIA PaCa-2, all of which exhibit K-Ras and
p53 mutations, except BxPC-3, which harbors wild-type
K-Ras. We treated these cell lines with different doses of
γ-T3 for various time periods and determined the inhibition
of proliferation by examining mitochondrial activity via the
MTT uptake method. As Fig. 1B shows, γ-T3 suppressed the
proliferation of all four pancreatic cancer cell lines in a
dose- and time-dependent manner, irrespective of the
genetic background (Fig. 1B). Proliferation of pancreatic
cancer cells was almost completely suppressed with a
50 μmol/L dose.
γ-T3 sensitizes human pancreatic cancer cells to
gemcitabine
Gemcitabine is a standard treatment for patients with
pancreatic cancer. To determine whether γ-T3 could enhance the apoptotic effects of gemcitabine in these cell lines,
we performed LIVE/DEAD assay that measured the esterase
activity. At a dose at which γ-T3 (10 μmol/L) and gemcitabine (200 nmol/L) alone had minimally toxic effects, the two
together were highly effective for inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro (Fig. 2). No significant differ-

ence was observed between the cell lines with respect to
their sensitivity to the combination.
γ-T3 inhibits constitutive NF-κB activation and
proteins associated with inflammation, proliferation,
invasion, and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer cells
Because NF-κB has been linked with both proliferation
and chemoresistance, we next examined whether γ-T3 could
inhibit constitutive NF-κB activation in MIA PaCa-2 cell
lines. Our results showed that γ-T3 inhibited constitutive
NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A).
We next investigated the effects of γ-T3 on the constitutive expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, cIAP-1, and
survivin. The expression of all these proteins was downregulated by γ-T3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).
When we examined whether γ-T3 could modulate the
constitutive expression of proliferative proteins cyclin D1,
c-Myc, and COX-2, we found that γ-T3 suppressed the
expression of all these proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C).
Likewise, γ-T3 downregulated the expression of proteins
linked to invasion, adhesion, and angiogenesis-MMP-9,

The imaging results showed that the tumor volume in the
combination group was significantly lower than in the group
treated with tocotrienol or gemcitabine alone as well as in
the vehicle-treated control group (P < 0.001 versus gemcitabine; P < 0.001 versus control). On the 42nd day, we euthanized the mice and measured the tumor volume with Vernier
calipers. The results were in concordance with those from
bioluminescence imaging and showed that the combination
reduced the tumor volume more than in the other three
groups (P < 0.001 versus control; Fig. 4D).
We next examined the expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in tumor tissues from the four groups.
The results in Fig. 5A show that γ-T3 in gemcitabine significantly downregulated the expression of Ki-67 in tumor
tissues compared with the control group (P < 0.05 versus
control). The results also showed that γ-T3 alone significantly suppressed the expression of Ki-67 (P < 0.05 versus
control; Fig. 5B).

Figure 3. γ-T3 inhibits constitutive activation of NF-κB and NF-κB–
regulated gene products in vitro. A, MIA PaCa-2 (1 × 106) cells were
treated with γ-T3 (10 and 50 μmol/L) for 4 h; nuclear extracts were
prepared and then assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA. B-D, Western
blot analysis showed that γ-T3 inhibited constitutive expression of
NF-κB–regulated gene products that regulate antiapoptosis (B),
proliferation (C), and metastasis and angiogenesis (D) in pancreatic
cancer cells. The MIA PaCa-2 (1 × 106) cells were treated with γ-T3
(10 and 50 μmol/L) for 24 h. Whole-cell lysates were prepared and
assayed for NF-κB–regulated gene products by Western blotting.
Data represent two independent experiments.

γ-T3 potentiates the antitumor activity of gemcitabine
in an orthotopic pancreatic tumor model in nude mice
Based on our in vitro results, we designed studies to determine the effects of γ-T3 on gemcitabine in orthotopically implanted human pancreatic tumors in nude mice (Fig. 4A).
The dose of γ-T3 used has been used previously for radiosensitization of tumors in mice (32).
Luciferase-transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells were implanted in
the tails of the pancreas in nude mice. Based on the IVIS
imaging, 1 week later, the mice were randomized into four
groups. The treatment was started 1 week after tumor cell
implantation and continued per experimental protocol for
4 weeks. The animals were euthanized 6 weeks after tumor
cell injection and 5 weeks from the date of treatment
(Fig. 4A). To determine tumor development and the effects
of γ-T3 and gemcitabine, we assessed the tumors with the
bioluminescence IVIS on days 7, 17, 24, and 29 after the start
of treatment. The bioluminescence imaging results (Fig. 4B
and C) indicated a gradual increase in tumor volume in
the control group compared with the three treatment groups.

γ-T3 inhibits NF-κB activation and NF-κB–regulated
gene products in orthotopic pancreatic tumors
We next investigated whether the effects of γ-T3 on tumor growth in mice were associated with the inhibition of
NF-κB activation. The results of immunohistochemical analysis showed that γ-T3 alone completely suppressed NF-κB
activation in orthotopically grown human pancreatic tumor
samples (Fig. 5B). γ-T3 also further suppressed NF-κB activation in gemcitabine-treated tissues. Immunohistochemical
analysis further showed that γ-T3 suppressed the expression of COX-2 (Fig. 5B, second panel), MMP-9 (Fig. 5B, third
panel), and VEGF (Fig. 5B, bottom) in human pancreatic
tumor tissues, and this effect was enhanced in tissues treated with gemcitabine.
γ-T3 potentiates the effects of gemcitabine in
downregulating the expression of NF-κB–regulated
gene products
We also examined NF-κB activation in tumor tissues by
EMSA. The results showed that γ-T3 alone abolished the
constitutive activation of NF-κB in the pancreatic tumor
tissue, and this down-modulation was maintained in tissue
obtained from animals treated with gemcitabine (Fig. 6A).
Thus, EMSA results confirmed those obtained from immunohistochemical analysis. NF-κB is known to regulate the
expression of proteins involved in proliferation: cyclin D1,
c-Myc, and COX-2. The expression of all these proteins was
found to be maximally downregulated in pancreatic tissue
obtained from animals treated with both agents together
(Fig. 6B). We also examined the expression of survival
proteins Bcl-xL, cIAP-1, and Bcl-2 by Western blot. Maximum downregulation was noted when both agents were
used together (Fig. 6C). When activation of caspase-9 and
caspase-3 were examined, maximum activation was also
noted when both agents were used together (Fig. 6C).
Our results also showed that γ-T3 and gemcitabine together
decreased the expression of proteins linked to metastasis
(MMP-9), invasion (ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (VEGF;
Fig. 6D). Thus, γ-T3 in combination with gemcitabine

inhibited the expression of various gene products in pancreatic tumors from mice.
γ-T3 can be detected in pancreatic tumor tissue
To determine whether γ-T3 is directly detectable in pancreatic tissue when given p.o., we extracted tissues and analyzed
them by HPLC for γ-T3. Purified γ-T3 was used as a control.
We also used tissues from untreated animals as a control. The
results in Fig. 6E show a significant presence of γ-T3 in human
pancreatic tumor tissue (94.12 ng/g tissue) compared with
untreated control. γ-T3 estimation by HPLC was linear in this
range (see Supplementary Fig. S1).

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal type of cancer, with
an estimated 5-year survival rate of around 4% despite the
best treatment available today. Agents that are nontoxic
and yet potentiate the effects of chemotherapy are highly
desirable. In the current study, we investigated whether
γ-T3, an analogue of vitamin E, could enhance the antitumor activity of gemcitabine against human pancreatic
cancer. We found that γ-T3 inhibited the proliferation of
various pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro, potentiated
gemcitabine-induced apoptosis, and inhibited constitutively

active NF-κB and NF-κB–regulated gene products. When
given alone, γ-T3 significantly inhibited the growth of PaCa
in established orthotopically grown human pancreatic
tumors in nude mice. In addition, γ-T3 further potentiated
the effects of gemcitabine against human pancreatic tumors
in nude mice.
We found that γ-T3 can suppress the proliferation of various pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our results agree with those
from Hussein and colleagues (17) that showed that δ-T3
could suppress the proliferation of Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2,
and BxPC-3 cells. This suppression of proliferation was due
to cell cycle arrest at G1. However, they did not investigate

the mechanism in detail (17). We found that downregulation
of cell proliferative gene products such as cyclin D1, c-Myc,
and COX-2 could account for the suppression of cell proliferation by γ-T3.
Our study is the first report to suggest that γ-T3 can
enhance the apoptotic effect of gemcitabine in various
pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. Previously, it has been
reported that γ-T3 can enhance the effect of gefitinib, docetaxel, celecoxi, and statins against various human cancers
(18–20, 27). Although different cancer has its own property
and therapeutic strategy, the synergistic action of γ-T3 is
partially confirmed.

γT3 Potentiates Gemcitabine Effect in Pancreatic Cancer

We found that this effect may be mediated through
the downregulation of cell survival proteins such as Bcl-2,
cIAP-1 and survivin by γ-T3. Moreover, constitutive NF-κB
expressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines has been
linked with chemoresistance (3). We found that this NF-κB
activation in cell lines was also suppressed by γ-T3. These
results are consistent with those previously reported
for curcumin (29) and resveratrol (33). Hussein and Mo

showed that mevalonate reversed the effect of δ-T3, thus
implicating the role of f3-hydroxy-f3-methylglutaryl CoA
(HMG-CoA) in action of δ-T3. Furthermore, lovastatin, an
inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, potentiated the antiproliferative effect of δ-T3 (17, 34). These results suggest that
γ-T3 can be used in combination with gemcitabine and
lovastatin, as γ-T3 is known to also inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (35–37). Similarly, we have shown previously that

both statins and γ-T3 are potent inhibitors of NF-κB activation (16, 38).
We found for the first time that p.o. administration of γ-T3
alone inhibited the growth of human pancreatic tumors
when examined in vivo in an orthotopic nude mice model.
Tumor growth was inhibited by almost 50% by 400 mg/kg
γ-T3 alone, and this level of inhibition was comparable with
that reduced by gemcitabine alone. γ-T3 was very well tolerated by the animals. When the two agents were used in combination, they were found to be much more effective.
How γ-T3 exhibited its effects in vivo were also investigated
in several ways. First, analysis of Ki-67 revealed that γ-T3
inhibited its proliferation in tumor tissues. Likewise, analysis
of NF-κB in pancreatic tumors showed that γ-T3 alone
inhibited constitutive activation of NF-κB. γ-T3 significantly
downregulated the expression of proinflammatory marker
COX-2, suppressed the expression of invasion biomarker
MMP-9, and inhibited the angiogenic biomarker VEGF in
the tissues. All of these effects were further enhanced by
gemcitabine. The synergistic interaction between the two
agents for down-modulation of various biomarkers was more
apparent by Western blot analysis than by immunohistochemical analysis. All these data indicate for the first time
the mechanisms by which γ-T3 could exhibit its effects
against human pancreatic cancer.
We also found a significant presence of intact γ-T3 in the
pancreatic tumor tissue (94.12 ng/g). These results agree with
those reported by Husain and colleagues (39) in a previous
study of δ-T3. They showed that δ-T3, when given p.o. at
100 mg/kg to mice, has a peak plasma concentration of
57 μmol/L at 2 hours, plasma T1/2 of 3.5 hours. Six-week feeding of δ-T3 gave a tissue level of 41 nmol/L/g tissue; levels were
10 times higher in pancreas than in tumor or liver tissue (39).
Vitamin E consists of four different isoforms of tocopherols and of tocotrienols (12). Among the tocotrienols, it

seems that anticancer activities are limited to only γ and
δ forms. Why α and β forms of tocotrienols exhibit minimal anticancer activities is not understood at present. Differential cellular uptake, membrane insertion, bioavailabilty,
antiantioxidant or anti-inflammatory potential may account
for these differences.
Overall, our results show for the first time that γ-T3 potentiates the antitumor activity of gemcitabine by inhibiting NF-κB and NF-κB–regulated gene products, leading to
the inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion.
However, further studies are necessary to confirm our findings in patients with pancreatic cancer. Considering that
tocotrienols, although structurally homologous to tocopherols, exhibit distinct molecular targets, they merit further exploration.
