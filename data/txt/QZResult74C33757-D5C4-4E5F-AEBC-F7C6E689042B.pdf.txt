ABSTRACT
Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutation
positive (EGFR M+) tumors initially respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) monotherapy, the responses are usually incomplete. In this study we show
that AKT inhibition, most importantly AKT2 inhibition, synergises with EGFR TKI
inhibition to increase cell killing in EGFR M+ NSCLC cells. However, our data also
suggest that the synergistic pro-apoptotic effects may be stunted due to a prosurvival
autophagy response induced by AKT inhibition. Consequently, inhibiting autophagy
with chloroquine significantly enhanced tumor cell death induced by gefitinib and AKT
inhibitors in EGFR M+ cells in vitro, and produced greater tumor shrinkage in EGFR M+
xenografts in vivo. Together, our findings suggest that adding chloroquine to EGFR
and AKT inhibition has the potential to improve tumor responses in EGFR M+ NSCLC,
and that selective targeting of AKT2 may provide a new treatment option in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

downstream mediator of phospho-inositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling, a pathway central in regulating cell
proliferation, survival, death, migration, and angiogenesis
[8]. It is therefore no surprise that perturbations in this
pathway have been implicated in tumorigenesis. There
are three AKT isoforms; AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, which
are closely related, but have been shown to have distinct
functions and locations [9]. AKT1, for example, has been
demonstrated to inhibit the invasion and migration of
breast cancer and ovarian cancer cells [10, 11], but has also
been shown to increase lung tumor cell growth, migration,
and metastasis [12, 13]. In contrast, while AKT2 has been
shown to promote apoptosis in lung cancer cells, it can
promote invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells [13,
14].
Despite the clear functional disparity between
AKT1, 2, and 3, current attempts in the clinic to inhibit
the pathway target all three AKT isoforms. The leading
clinical candidate is MK2206, an orally administered
allosteric AKT inhibitor that has been evaluated in several
clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors. MK2206
has so far shown only moderate efficacy both alone and

Lung cancer is the leading form of cancer worldwide
in terms of both incidence and death [1]. Non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung
cancer is of epithelial origin and accounts for 80% of all
lung cancers [2]. 15-30% of NSCLC patients have tumors
harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) [3, 4]. These mutations are most
commonly found in never smokers and are associated
with response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),
including gefitinib and erlotinib [3, 4]. Although a high
proportion of patients with EGFR mutation positive
(EGFR M+) tumors initially obtain significant clinical
benefits from EGFR TKIs, acquired drug resistance
usually occurs within 12 months of starting treatment [5,
6]. Therefore, there is significant unmet clinical need to
improve efficacy of treatment for this group of NSCLC
patients.
EGFR elicits its effects by signaling through
downstream kinases such as extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and AKT [7]. AKT is the primary

in combination with other drugs and has been associated
with toxicities including rash, nausea, and hyperglaecemia
[15, 16]. The potential opposing roles of the specific AKT
isoforms, as well as the toxicity associated with pan-AKT
inhibition, suggests that the development of AKT isoform
specific inhibitors may be of future interest
Amongst the many processes that AKT is involved
in, AKT inhibition with the use of either AKT inhibitors or
siRNA, has been shown to induce autophagy in a variety
of cell types [17-19]. Autophagy is a catabolic cellular
process catalysed by the ubiquitin-like LC3 in which
cells recycle subcellular components into membrane
vacuoles known as autophagosomes [20]. Some regulators
of autophagy have been shown to function as tumor
suppressors by promoting protein degradation and thereby
reducing cell growth. Conversely, autophagy has been
shown to act as an anti-apoptotic mechanism for tumor
cells under metabolic stresses such as hypoxia and growthfactor removal [21-23]. Furthermore, the use of autophagy
inhibitors has been shown to promote cancer cell death
in combination with various cancer therapies [17, 24].
In this study we investigate the isoform specific roles of
AKT in regulating the response of EGFR M+ NSCLC
cells to gefitinib, and the impact of inhibiting prosurvival
autophagy induced by AKT inhibition.

H1975), according to the approximate ratios of the IC50s
for each drug (Fig. 1A). The combination index (CI) value
for each of the cell lines was <1 at ED50 and ED75 (Table
2), suggesting that MK2206 and gefitinib had synergistic
effects on growth inhibition in both EGFR WT and EGFR
M+ cell lines.
To assess clonogenic survival, cells were treated
with gefitinib (0.1 µM for HCC-827 and PC-9 or 1 µM
for A549 and H1975) and/or MK2206 (1 µM) for 24 h,
and then cultured to form colonies ≥50 cells. Whereas
MK2206 did not have a significant effect on clonogenic
survival, the combination of MK2206 and gefitinib
significantly reduced clonogenic survival in PC-9
(-40.7±3.4%, p=0.03) and HCC-827 cells (-37.2±3.3%,
p<0.01), compared with gefitinib alone, but not in A549
or H1975 cells (Fig. 1B).

MK2206 increases sensitivity of EGFR M+ cells
to gefitinib-induced apoptosis and inhibition of
downstream signaling pathways
To assess the effects of MK2206 and gefitinib on
EGFR downstream signaling, cells were treated with either
gefitinib or MK2206 alone, or in combination, for 24 h,
and western blotting carried out. In PC-9 cells, treatment
with gefitinib (0.1 µM) markedly reduced pEGFR and
pAKT levels (Fig. 2A). Reduced pAKT levels were also
evident after gefitinib treatment (1.0 µM) in A549 cells,
but to a lesser extent than in PC-9 cells (Fig. 2B). MK2206
treatment (1.0 µM) on the other hand, significantly
reduced the levels of pAKT in both cell lines. Combining
MK2206 and gefitinib further reduced both pAKT and
pEGFR levels in PC-9 cells, but not in A549 cells (Fig. 2A
and B). In addition, combined treatment with gefitinib and
MK2206 for 24 h in PC-9 (but not A549) cells resulted
in an increase in levels of cleaved PARP compared with
gefitinib or MK2206 alone, suggesting increased levels of
apoptosis (Fig. 2A and B).
To assess the effects of combined drug treatment
on apoptosis, cells were treated with gefitinib (PC-9;
0.1 µM, and A549; 1 µM) for 18 h, and stained with
Hoechst 33258. Hoechst fluorescence was imaged in live
cells, and cells with condensed nuclei and high staining

RESULTS
MK2206 increases sensitivity of EGFR M+
NSCLC cells to gefitinib-induced growth
inhibition and clonogenic cell killing
EGFR M+ NSCLC cells (HCC-827, PC-9) were
markedly more sensitive to growth inhibition by an
EGFR TKI (gefitinib) as well as the AKT inhibitor
MK2206, compared with EGFR wild-type cells (A549)
and EGFR T790M cells (H1975) (Table 1). The method
of Chou and Talalay [25] was used to assess the effects
of the combination of gefitinib and MK2206 on NSCLC
cell proliferation. Cells were treated with gefitinib and
MK2206 alone, or in combination, at a fixed concentration
ratio of 1:20 (PC-9 and HCC-827) or 1:1 (A549 and

MK2206 treatment alone induced low levels of apoptosis

drugs concurrently, the percentage of apoptotic cells was
significantly increased, compared with gefitinib alone

decreased PC-9 cell proliferation when combined with
AKT1 siRNA (p=0.013) and AKT2 siRNA (p<0.01),
but not AKT3 siRNA (p=0.12), compared with gefitinib
treated non-targeting control (NT) (Fig. 3A). Combination
with gefitinib also led to an increase in PC-9 apoptosis
levels. Although inhibition of total AKT induced the
greatest amount of apoptosis (20.2% ± 2.12%) in
combination with gefitinib, it wasn’t significantly more
than that induced by AKT2 siRNA. In addition, AKT2
was the only isoform whose inhibition in the presence of
gefitinib significantly increased the levels of apoptosis in
PC-9 cells, compared with gefitinib treated NT siRNA
(p<0.01) (Fig. 3B).
Although inhibiting total AKT levels had a
significant effect on the growth of A549 cells in the
presence of gefitinib, the results suggest that there is no
specific isoform responsible for this effect. Furthermore,
there is a suggestion that AKT1 signaling may be involved
in resistance to gefitinib induced apoptosis of A549 cells

Selective inhibition of AKT protein isoforms using

In order to determine relative contribution of AKT
isoforms, siRNAs against AKT1, 2, and 3, and total AKT,
respectively, were introduced into PC-9 and A549 cells

blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1).

assessed using the IN Cell Analyzer. Each inhibitor alone
induced only low levels of apoptosis in both PC-9 and
A549 cells (Fig. 4A and B).
However, when each of the AKT inhibitors (10µM)
was combined with gefitinib, there was a marked increase
in apoptosis levels (MK-2006; 14.2% ± 1.85%, AKT1/2i;
12.3% ± 1.2%, and AKT2i; 12.4% ± 0.89%, p<0.01 for
each dual treatment compared with either monotherapy
alone) in PC-9 cells (Fig. 4A). With MK2206 and
AKT2i, this combination also proved effective at the
lower concentration of 1µM. A similar sensitivity to all

H1975 cells however, only the combination of gefitinib
and MK2206 proved to be effective (Supplementary Fig.
S2B), while A549 cells were insensitive to all treatment
(Fig. 4B).
In addition, following 24 h treatment with gefitinib
and the AKT inhibitors, western blotting for PARP
cleavage was carried out on PC-9 cells. Similarly to the
IN Cell Analyzer results, while gefitinib monotherapy
induced PARP cleavage, each of the inhibitors alone did
not (Fig. 4C). However, when the AKT inhibitors (10µM)
were combined with gefitinib, levels of cleaved PARP
were significantly enhanced.

Proliferation assays revealed that the combination
of AKT1/2i with gefitinib synergistically inhibited the
growth of all cell lines tested, notably that of PC-9 and
A549 (Supplementary table S1). The combination of
gefitinib and AKT2i, synergistically inhibited the growth
of HCC-827 cells but only had an additive effect on the
other cell lines, as measured by CI (Supplementary table
S2).
However, AKT1/2i and AKT2i have not been well
characterised and therefore potential off target effects
cannot be ruled out. In addition, as no AKT3 selective
inhibitors are currently available, it is difficult to determine
whether it too has a more pertinent role. Together with the
siRNA data, this suggests that the AKT2 isoform is most
important in the gefitinib induced response of EGFR M+
NSCLC cells.

PC-9 cells (Fig. 6A). Notably, when chloroquine, gefitinib,
and an AKT inhibitor were all combined, apoptosis was
further enhanced. A similar result was observed in the

Treatment with AKT inhibitors induced puncta
characteristic of autophagy as previously observed in
other cancer cell types [17, 18]. After 24 h treatment with
each of the AKT inhibitors (0-10µM), western blotting and
IF staining was carried out for LC3 in PC-9 cells. LC3-I
is recruited during autophagosome formation where it
is cleaved and lipidated to form LC3-II, which migrates
faster on a SDS-PAGE gel, and appears in autophagosome
puncta when carrying out IF staining, serving as a
characteristic trait of autophagic activation [28].
IF staining for LC3 revealed that the AKT inhibitors
induced more autophagosome formation than in the
untreated control, as shown by the presence of LC3
puncta. This effect was evident in each of the cell lines
used, irrespective of their mutation status (Fig. 5A and
B, and Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, western
blotting demonstrated that the AKT inhibitors induced
the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in a dose-dependent
manner, with the effect being particularly evident at the
highest dose of 10µM (Fig. 5C)

Inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine sensitises
EGFR M+ cells to combined treatment with
EGFR and AKT inhibitors
In order to determine whether AKT inhibitorinduced autophagy is acting as a pro- or anti-survival
mechanism in NSCLC cells, we indirectly blocked
autophagy with a pharmacologic inhibitor chloroquine,
which disturbs lysosome function. Briefly, the cells
were treated with 10µM MK2206, AKT1/2i, or AKT2i,
0.1/1µM of gefitinib, and 20µM chloroquine for 18 h,
before apoptosis was analyzed using the IN Cell Analyzer,
and western blotting for LC3 and PARP cleavage.

HCC-827 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A), but not in the
A549 (Fig. 6B) or H1975 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
These results were confirmed by western blotting
where combining MK2206, AKT1/2i, or AKT2i,
with gefitinib and chloroquine, increased the levels
of cleaved PARP, compared with chloroquine and
gefitinib dual therapy (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig.
S5A). Chloroquine treatment was associated with an
increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, probably due to
autophagosome accumulation, confirming that autophagy
was successfully inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S5B) [29].

EGFR downstream effectors including MAPK or PI3K/
AKT [30], suggesting that one potential approach to
improve efficacy is to combine EGFR TKIs with inhibitors
of these other pathways. AKT activation has been reported
in 51% of NSCLC patient samples and 74% of NSCLC
cell lines, suggesting that combining EGFR and AKT
inhibition may increase anti-tumor activity and prevent
the occurrence of resistance to EGFR TKIs [31, 32].
Currently, the most advanced AKT inhibitor in clinical
development is MK2206, an orally active, non-ATP
competitive, allosteric pan-AKT inhibitor [16].
An approach we use in our laboratory is to identify
agents that selectively induce rapid (≤24 h) apoptotic
cell death in the presence of gefitinib, but only in EGFR
M+ NSCLC cells. As part of this search we evaluated
MK2206. Although this combination was synergistic
in both EGFR M+ and EGFR WT cells in proliferation
assays, the effects were modest and only apparent at lower
doses. However, the effect on apoptosis was more marked
and associated with significant reductions in clonogenic
cell survival in EGFR M+ cells. In addition, the drug
combination resulted in decreased pathway signaling
(pEGFR, pAKT) in EGFR M+ cells compared with single
drug treatments, which may in part explain the augmented
levels of apoptosis seen in EGFR M+ cells treated with
gefitinib and MK2206.
MK2206, as well as PI3K inhibitors, have been
shown to act synergistically to improve anti-tumor activity
in combination with EGFR TKIs in both the KRAS/EGFR
WT and EGFR M+ NSCLC setting [30, 33, 34]. In one
study, MK2206 in combination with erlotinib or lapatinib
resulted in a synergistic inhibition of proliferation of both
erlotinib sensitive and insensitive cells [35]. Combining
MK2206 with gefitinib has also been shown to be
successful in EGFR expressing malignant glioma cells,
where combined therapy resulted in a synergistic increase
in apoptosis and autophagy in vitro, and increased antitumor activity in vivo [36]. Due to this success, there
are currently two on-going Phase I studies combining
MK2206 with gefitinib in NSCLC patients (NCT01294306
and NCT01147211), one which is specifically enriched for
EGFR mutations..
However, despite this relatively improved benefit
of combining MK2206 and gefitinib in EGFR M+
cells, preclinical data using mouse models has shown
that combined inhibition of both AKT1 and AKT2 can
result in insulin resistance as well as hyperglycaemia
and hyperinsulinaemia [37]. A dose-escalating phase I
clinical trial of MK2206 demonstrated target inhibition
in biomarker samples at plasma drug levels of greater
than 50-65 nM which can be sustained at the maximum
tolerated dose (60 mg QOD) [38]. However, adverse
events including skin rash and hyperglycaemia [16],
suggest that therapeutic benefit of pan-AKT inhibition
may be limited, and that inhibiting all three AKT isoforms
may not be the best approach to maximise clinical benefit.

Inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine further
sensitises EGFR M+ cells to EGFR and AKT
inhibition in vivo
Following our in vitro results, we wanted to test
the efficiency of these drug combinations in vivo. HCC827 cells were subcutaneously injected onto the flanks of
Balb/C female nude mice (n=36). Once the tumors reached
100mm3 in volume, the mice were treated with vehicle
control (p.o, days 1-3), gefitinib (p.o. 25mg/kg, days
1-3), MK2206 (p.o. 50mg/kg, days 1-3), chloroquine (i.p.
60mg/kg, days 1-3), gefitinib and chloroquine, MK2206
and chloroquine, gefitinib and MK2206, or gefitinib,
MK2206, and chloroquine.
Due to the acute response that we observed in
proliferation and apoptosis assays, we investigated a 3 day
dosing period in vivo. All treatments significantly inhibited
tumor growth compared with the control (P<0.05,
ANOVA), with the gefitinib containing regimens being
the most effective (Fig. 7A). Overall, the treatments were
well tolerated with no significant adverse clinical signs.
Mice treated with the triple combination lost more weight
than the other treatment groups, but weight loss was never
above 4%, and the animals regained their weight a few
days following treatment (Fig. 7B).
Adding MK2206 or chloroquine to gefitinib
increased anti-tumor effects, but this did not reach
statistical significance (Fig. 7A). Notably, the triple
combination of adding chloroquine to gefitinib and
MK2206 was more effective than either double
combination, with tumors 35% smaller than gefitinib
plus MK2206 alone (Fig. 7C). The benefit of the triple
combination was only apparent at the end of the treatment
period (Fig. 7A, C), and was lost as tumors regrew
suggesting sustained benefit would require prolonged
dosing.

DISCUSSION
Improving treatment outcomes for NSCLC patients
with EGFR mutations remains an area of high unmet
clinical need [3-5]. One common mechanism of resistance
to EGFR inhibitors is overexpression and activation of

Therefore, we investigated whether a specific
AKT isoform is more important in regulating the effects
of gefitinib in EGFR M+ cells. We initially attempted
this with the use of AKT isoform selective siRNAs,
and went on to validate our observations using isoform
selective inhibitors of AKT 1 and 2, and AKT2. This
data shows that inhibiting AKT2 with siRNA results
in significantly increased sensitivity to both the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of gefitinib, with
AKT1 also proving important in growth inhibition. AKT3
inhibition meanwhile did not have any significant effects.
These effects were selective for EGFR M+ NSCLC cells
(compared with EGFR WT), indicating that AKT2 and
possibly AKT1, play an important role in conferring
resistance of EGFR M+ cells to gefitinib induced apoptosis
and growth inhibition.
The role of AKT2 in lung tumorigenesis remains
unclear and studies have not yielded wholly consistent
results. Using mouse Kras-dependent lung tumor models,
AKT2 loss decreased lung tumor formation in the
4-(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)
model, had no effect on a Kras(LA2) model, and increased
tumor formation in a urethane-induced model [39]. In
contrast, AKT1 was most important for tumor initiation
and progression in these mouse lung tumor models [12].
The reason for this disparity may be due to this particular
lung tumor model being induced by KRAS mutations,
whereas the EGFR M+ cell lines used in our study are
wild-type for KRAS. Furthermore, our data suggest that
in A549 cells, which are KRAS mutant [40], AKT1 may
be more important for determining EGFR TKI sensitivity.
Additionally, AKT3, but not AKT2 depletion, was found
to inhibit proliferation and survival of lung cancer derived
disseminated human tumor cells [41].
Apart from apoptosis, AKT inhibition has also been
shown to induce autophagy. For example, the pan-AKT
inhibitor AZD5363 has recently been reported to induce
autophagy in prostate cancer cells, by down-regulating
the mTOR pathway [17]. Furthermore, prolonged downregulation of AKT2 using siRNA induces conversion of
LC3-I to LC3-II, resulting in cell death by autophagy of
the mitochondria in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231
[18]. Our data show that the selective AKT2i induces
autophagy, though we cannot rule out any involvement
of the other AKT isoforms. In addition, in our studies
siRNA against total AKT did not induce autophagy (data
not shown), consistent with a recent report from another
group using A549 cells [19].
Autophagy has been shown to provide cancer cells
with an energy source in order to help them survive in
environments unfavorable for normal cells, suggesting
that inhibiting autophagy may potentiate the effects of
targeted therapies [42]. For example, it has been shown
that inhibiting autophagy in HER2 overexpressing breast
cancer cells, sensitised them to EGFR TKIs [43]. In
addition, a more recent study has shown that autophagy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition by chloroquine further sensitises EGFR M+
NSCLC cells to erlotinib [44]. This is in accordance
with our data, where the combination of gefitinib and
chloroquine enhanced PARP cleavage by western blotting,
compared with either treatment alone.
This is in contrast to a recent study, which has
shown that inhibiting autophagy promotes tumor survival,
and antagonises the effects of erlotinib in HCC-827 cells
both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the authors concluded
that patients receiving EGFR TKIs should not be treated
with autophagy inhibitors, as this might worsen rather than
improve their prognosis [45]. Our data however, shows
no evidence for antagonism of chloroquine and gefitinib
in EGFR M+ cells in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore,
when chloroquine was added to the combination of
MK2206 and gefitinib in HCC-827 cells, it significantly
increased apoptosis in vitro and decreased tumor growth
of xenografts, suggesting that autophagy may provide a
survival mechanism in the context of AKT inhibition.
Chloroquine is known to have pleiotropic effects.
In addition to inhibiting autophagy, it has been reported to
induce apoptosis at concentrations higher than 50µM [46,
47]. In this study we used 20µM chloroquine, which did
not induce apoptosis but did affect autophagy. Chloroquine
has been shown to sensitise prostate cancer cells with a
PTEN deletion to AKT inhibition by AZD5363 [17, 48].
In contrast, when we combined MK2206 and chloroquine
in EGFR M+ NSCLC cells, this did not have any added
benefit, but these cells are highly dependent on EGFR
rather than AKT signaling for survival.
In conclusion, this study implicates AKT2 signaling
as a determinant of gefitinib resistance in EGFR M+ cells.
Our data suggest combining AKT2 selective inhibitors
with an EGFR TKI as an interesting matching target
therapeutic approach in EGFR M+ NSCLC tumors [49].
Furthermore, our data suggest that the effect of this novel
combination may be limited by a prosurvival autophagy
response, and that combining chloroquine with EGFR and
AKT inhibition in the EGFR M+ NSCLC patient subgroup
may be of additional benefit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
HCC-827 (EGFR exon 19 mutation, DelE746_
A750), H1975 (EGFR_L858R, EGFR_T790M), A549,
(EGFR wild type (WT), KRAS G12S mutation), were
acquired from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) in 2010-2012. PC-9 (EGFR exon
19 mutation, DelE746_A750) was kindly provided by
Dr. Kazuto Nishio, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan in
04/2010. Upon receipt, all cell lines were authenticated
by mitochondrial DNA sequencing and were passaged

Clonogenic survival assay

for no longer than 3 months post authentication [50]. Cell
lines were routinely maintained in Advanced DMEM/F-12
(Invitrogen Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 5%
FBS (Invitrogen Inc.), GlutaMAX™, and PenicillinStreptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., Poole, Dorset, UK).
Cells were cultured at 37˚C in a humidified environment
containing 7.5% CO2.

Sensitivity to the combination of gefitinib and
MK2206 was assessed using clonogenic survival assays.
Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (Appleton
Woods Ltd.), allowed to settle overnight, and treated in
duplicate with gefitinib (0.1/1 μM), MK2206 (1 µM), or a
combination of the two, for 24 h. Cells were washed, and
incubated to allow for colony formation. Colonies were
fixed and stained in crystal violet (0.5% crystal violet,
4.5% acetic acid, 20% ddH2O, 75% MeOH), and colonies
(≥50 cells) counted.

Compounds
Gefitinib and MK2206 were obtained from Selleck
Chemicals (Texas, USA) and stored as 10 mM stock
solutions in DMSO at -20°C. The AKT Inhibitor VIII,
Isozyme-selective Akti-1/2, and the AKT inhibitor
XII isozyme selective, Akti-2 were purchased from
Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Chloroquine was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis
Cells were treated with gefitinib (0.1 µM) and/
or MK2206 (1 µM), or 0.1% DMSO (control) for 24 h.
The cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50mM TrisHcl pH7.6, 137mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Igepal,
0.1% SDS, 50mM NaF, protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland)), and 50μg protein per lane was loaded onto
a 10% Mini-PROTEAN® Precast TGX Gel (Bio-Rad,
Hemel Hempstead, UK). After electrophoresis, protein
was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad),
blocked in LI-COR blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences,
Nebraska, USA), and incubated overnight with primary
antibodies (supplementary table 3). IRDye® secondary
antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences) were added, and bands
detected using an Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR
Biosciences). Band quantification was performed using
ImageJ. To quantify cleaved PARP, bands for both total
and cleaved PARP were normalized to the corresponding
β-actin levels.

In vitro cell proliferation assay
Cells (1 x 103 in 100µl DMEM), were seeded into
96-well cell culture plates (Corning, Appleton Woods
Limited, Birmingham, UK), and left overnight. Cells were
treated in triplicate with gefitinib (0-0.4 µM for PC-9, and
0-8 µM for A549) or MK2206 (0-8 µM), either alone or
in combination. Following 5 days incubation, resazurin
(12.5μg/ml; 1:10 of total volume, Sigma-Aldrich) was
added, and cell viability assessed by fluorescence intensity
(POLARstar Omega; BMG Labtech GmbH, Germany)
at 540 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. Data was
expressed relative to DMSO treated controls.
In order to assess the effect of AKT siRNA on
growth inhibition, 24h after transfection, cells were treated
with 0.1% DMSO or gefitinib (0.1 µM), and left to grow
for 5 days before growth rate was assessed using resazurin.

Quantification of apoptosis

IC50 determination

Cells were plated into 96-well plates (1 x 105 cells/
well) in phenol red free DMEM/F-12 media (Invitrogen
Inc.), and incubated overnight. The next day, cells were
treated in triplicate with either gefitinib (0.1 µM/1 µM)
and/or MK2206 (1 µM), and incubated for 18 h. Hoechst
33258 (25 µM) was added and incubation continued for
45-60 min.
The fluorescent cells were imaged (360 nm
excitation, 460 nm emission) using the IN Cell Analyzer
1000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK). Using automated software analysis (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences), cells with condensed nuclei that have a
high nuclear intensity are defined as apoptotic, and total
number and percent apoptotic cells calculated.
In order to assess the effect of AKT siRNA on
apoptosis, 54 h after transfection, cells were treated with
0.1% DMSO or gefitinib (0.1 µM) for 18 h before the
addition of Hoechst. Apoptosis was analyzed as above.

IC50 values were determined using CalcuSyn
software (BIOSOFT®, Cambridge, UK), taking into
account the average of all experiments.

Combination index
In order to measure any potential synergistic
drug interactions, combination studies were performed
according to the median-effect method of Chou and
Talalay [25, 51, 52]. Each drug alone was tested at
concentrations of 8x, 4x, 2x, 1x, 0.5x, 0.25x, and 0.125x
its IC50. For the combination, the fixed ratio (1:1) of each
drug at 8x, 4x, 2x, 1x, 0.5x, 0.25x, and 0.125x its IC50
value was tested. Drug exposure was simultaneous. The
data was analyzed using CalcuSyn software (BIOSOFT®).

animals received 1% polysorbate 20 p.o., days 1-3. For
combination treatments, gefitinib and MK2206 were given
simultaneously, while chloroquine was given 2 h before
treatment with gefitinib or MK2206.

siGENOME SMARTpool® siRNA containing 3
specific siRNAs for AKT1 (M-003000-03), AKT2 (M003001-02), AKT3 (M-003002-02), and non-targeting
control (D-001206-13-05), were purchased from
DHARMACON Research Inc. (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Lafayette, CO). SignalSilence AKT (I) siRNA (6211s) was
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).
Briefly, PC-9 and A549 cells were grown to 50%
confluency, and then transfected with siRNA (25nM)
using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen Inc.). Cells were
harvested up to 72h later, and analyzed for the expression
of each protein, using western blotting. Controls were
transfected with non-targeting siRNA, and grown under
similar conditions. Knock down levels were determined
by band quantification using Image J.

Statistics
Statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel
2011. T-Tests were carried out in order to determine
statistical relevance (P<0.05). The in vivo data was
analyzed using ANOVA (SPSS), with treatment group and
days after treatment used as factors.

Immunoflourescent staining of LC3

Financial support:

Cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of
10,000 cells per well and left to adhere overnight before
treatment with the AKT inhibitors (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM)
for 24 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
then permeabilised in 0.25% Triton-X in PBS. Cells
were blocked in 3% BSA in PBS, treated overnight with
an LCA3/B (G40) primary antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) at a concentration of 1:1000. This was
followed by 1 h incubation with an Alexa555 conjugated
secondary antibody (Invitrogen Inc.) in darkness, and 5
minutes with DNA stain DAPI (1mg/ml). LC3 staining
was assessed using the IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences).
