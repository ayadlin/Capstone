ABSTRACT
The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is significantly associated
with advanced tumor stages and poor survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
thereby implicating it as a potential target for HCC treatment. We aim to further
understand its biological roles in hepatocarcinogenesis, as a means to exploit it for
therapeutic purposes. By screening using the ProtoArray® Human Protein Microarrays,
we identified glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and the orphan nuclear receptor
(Nur77) as potential interaction partners of NDRG1. These interactions were
confirmed in HCC cell lines in vitro by co-immunoprecipitation; and co-localizations
of NDRG1 with GSK-3β and Nur77 were observed by immunofluorescence staining.
Additionally, high levels of NDRG1 competitively bind to GSK-3β and Nur77 to allow
β-catenin to escape degradation, with consequent elevated levels of downstream
oncogenic genes. In vivo, we consistently observed that NDRG1 suppression in HCC
xenografts decreased β-catenin levels and its downstream target Cyclin D1, with
concomitant tumor growth inhibition. Clinically, the over-expression of NDRG1 in
HCC patient samples is positively correlated with GSK-3β-9ser (│R│= 0.28, p = 0.01),
Nur77 (│R│= 0.42, p < 0.001), and β-catenin (│R│= 0.32, p = 0.003) expressions. In
conclusion, we identified GSK-3β and Nur77 as novel interaction partners of NDRG1.
These protein-protein interactions regulate the turnover of β-catenin and subsequent
downstream signaling mediated by β-catenin in HCC cells, and provides potential
targets for future therapeutic interventions.

relevant biomarker of HCC. NDRG1 is a stress response
protein whose expression is regulated by a variety of
cellular stresses, especially hypoxia [1–4]. Significant
up-regulation of NDRG1 was observed in HCC tissues
compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues at both
mRNA and protein levels [5, 6], and it has also been
suggested as a novel biomarker of liver cancer recurrence
[7]. More importantly, over-expression of NDRG1 was
significantly and positively associated with aggressive
tumor features such as high AFP levels (400 ng/ml),
advanced stages, vascular invasion, dedifferentiation,
metastasis, recurrence, and poor survival rates [6]. Recent
functional studies suggested that knockdown of NDRG1
induced cellular senescence through inhibiting GSK3β–p53/p16 pathway in HCC cells, implying a possible

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh
most lethal malignancy worldwide, and the second
leading cause of cancer related death (746,000 in 2012)
(2012 Globocan (WHO IARC)). It is typically fatal with
a mortality-to-incidence ratio of 0.95 due to difficulties
in early detection, limited therapeutic options, and high
recurrence rates. Lack of reliable HCC biomarkers leads
to late diagnosis, especially in high risk populations
(chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus).
Meanwhile, there is no curative therapy for the majority
of HCC patients who are diagnosed at advanced stages.
Our previous gene expression data identified N-Myc

connection of NDRG1 with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway which plays crucial roles in many types of
malignancies, including HCC [8]. These clinical and
functional observations suggest that NDRG1 is a potential
therapeutic target for HCC.
We aim to further elucidate the biological functions
mediated by NDRG1 in HCC cells, so as to improve
our understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor
progression, which in turn may allow rational design of
novel therapeutic approaches targeting NDRG1. To this end,
we attempt to identify novel interaction partners of NDRG1
through protein array screening and to further study the
molecular events regulated by these interactions in HCC cells.

Both GSK-3β and Nur77 mediate β-catenin
degradation through independent pathways [9, 10].
Thus, we hypothesized that the interaction of NDRG1
with either or both of these interaction partners may be
associated with β-catenin regulation in HCC cells. We
used HepG2 and Hep3B cells as our working models, in
particular inducing NDRG1 in Hep3B cells under hypoxia
to support data observed in HepG2 cells (under normoxia
and hypoxia).
Using Western blot and immunofluorescence
staining following subcellular fractionation, we observed
that nuclear localization of β-catenin was enhanced in both
HepG2 and Hep3B cells under hypoxia, corresponding to
induction of NDRG1 in both cell lines (Figure 3A and
3B). These data indicated that hypoxia promoted nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin in HCC cells, which may be
mediated by hypoxia-inducible NDRG1 expression. Thus,
high levels of NDRG1 may promote nuclear accumulation
of β-catenin in HCC cells.
To demonstrate whether NDRG1 is involved in the
regulation of β-catenin nuclear accumulation in HCC cells,
the NDRG1-specific siRNA was transfected into HepG2
cells which express high levels of NDRG1 even under
normoxia. Western blot results indicated that suppression
of NDRG1 expression reduced nuclear accumulation of
β-catenin, accompanied by reduced levels of GSK-3β
9ser (inactive form of GSK-3β), and Cyclin D1 (a key
downstream target of β-catenin) (Figure 3C). NDRG1
suppression also enhanced cytoplasmic Nur77 levels, which
might also act to further degrade β-catenin (Figure 3C).
Immunofluorescence staining consistently showed that
NDRG1 suppression dramatically decreased β-catenin
levels and prevented its nuclear accumulation (Figure 3D).
To determine whether the hypoxia-induced nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin is regulated by NDRG1, we
transfected HepG2 and Hep3B cells with NDRG1-specific
siRNA and cultured these cells under hypoxia. Subcellular
fractionation followed by Western blotting showed that
NDRG1 suppression decreased nuclear accumulation of
β-catenin in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells under hypoxia,
with accompanying decreases in GSK-3β 9ser and Cyclin
D1 levels, and increased cytoplasmic accumulation of Nur77
(Figure 3E). Consistently, immunofluorescence results
demonstrated markedly reduced cytoplasmic and nuclear
β-catenin levels after NDRG1 suppression (Figure 3F).

RESULTS
NDRG1 binds directly to GSK-3β and Nur77 in
HCC cells
To better understand the role of NDRG1 in
hepatocarcinogenesis, we first purified NDRG1 full length
protein with the V5 tag. Coomassie gel staining showed a
single band at 50 KD, representative of NDRG1 (arrow;
Figure 1A). When this purified full length NDRG1 protein
was used to probe for potential interaction proteins using the
protein microarray, we identified a list of candidate proteins
with p values less than 0.05. Among these candidates, we
selected GSK-3β and Nur77, two functionally important
proteins on the top of list, for further investigations.
To validate these potential hits, we first confirmed the
interactions of NDRG1 with GSK-3β and Nur77 in a
panel of HCC cell lines using Co-IP. The interactions of
NDRG1 with GSK-3β, and of NDRG1 with Nur77 were
only detected in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, but not in Hep3B
cells which lack NDRG1 expression under normoxia
(Figure 1B). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining
consistently showed co-localization (yellow signal) of
NDRG1 with GSK-3β, and of NDRG1 with Nur77 in Huh7
and HepG2 cells, but not in Hep3B cells (Figure 1C).
When HCC cells were cultured under hypoxic
conditions of 0.5% O2, NDRG1, a known hypoxiainducible protein, was induced in all three cell lines,
with marked induction observed in Hep3B cells that
had undetectable levels of NDRG1 under normoxia
(Figure 2A). Using Co-IP, we again detected interaction
of NDRG1 with GSK-3β, and of NDRG1 with Nur77
in all three cell lines under hypoxia (Figure 2B). Subcellular co-localizations of NDRG1 with GSK-3β
or with Nur77 were again consistently observed by
immunofluorescence staining under hypoxia in all three
cell lines (Figure 2C). These observations validate that
NDRG1 binds directly with GSK-3β and Nur77 in HCC
cells, and these interactions are maintained/induced under
hypoxic conditions, which may mediate the functions
of NDRG1 in HCC cells particularly under the hypoxic
tumor microenvironment.

regulates β-catenin degradation in HCC cells

degradation, and we observed that NDRG1 enhance

β-catenin degradation (allowing nuclear accumulation) in
HCC cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated Hep3B cells
(under normoxia; no NDRG1) with 10 μM of the GSK-3β
agonist LY294002, or the Nur77 agonist Cns-A for 48 hours,
and then analyzed β-catenin expression and localization in
HCC cells. LY294002 enhanced GSK-3β activity as observed
by decreased levels of GSK-3β 9ser (the inactive form of
GSK-3β), whereas Cns-A up-regulated Nur77 expression
and also its nuclear expression in all three HCC cell lines.
Even though both these events would be expected to promote
β-catenin degradation, we observed reduced β-catenin only
in Hep3B cells which have undetectable NDRG1 expression
under normoxia (Figure 4A and 4B). These data suggested
that the presence of high NDRG1 levels in the other two cell
lines (HepG2 and Huh7) may have a protective effect against
β-catenin degradation.
To further confirm this observation, we transfected
HepG2 and Huh7 cells (with high endogenous NDRG1
levels) with NDRG1-specific siRNA, and examined the
effects of NDRG1 protein suppression on GSK-3β or Nur77
agonist treatment under normoxia. As expected, NDRG1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suppression reduced β-catenin levels and its nuclear
accumulation (Figure 4C and 4D), similar to what was
observed in Hep3B cells. This was consistently observed
in Hep3B cells (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B). Under
normoxia, treatment with either GSK-3β or Nur77 agonist
alone decreased β-catenin level markedly. However, under
hypoxia when NDRG1 was induced, treatment with either
agonist alone caused only a minimal decrease in β-catenin
level. Marked decrease in β-catenin level was observed only
when hypoxic Hep3B cells were treated with either agonist
combined with NDRG1 siRNA. These data demonstrate the
protective role of NDRG1 against in β-catenin degradation.

To further understand the protective effect of
NDRG1 against β-catenin degradation through its
interactions with GSK-3β and Nur77, we examined the
possibility that NDRG1 might disrupt GSK-3β-β-catenin

and Nur77-β-catenin interactions through competitive
binding. We treated Hep3B cells with either GSK-3β
agonist LY294002, or Nur77 agonist Cns-A, and then used
β-catenin antibody to pull down the complexes, which
were detected using either GSK-3β or Nur77 respectively.
We observed that each agonist alone enhanced the binding
of GSK-3β to β-catenin (Figure 5A) and of Nur77 to
β-catenin (Figure 5B). The addition of purified NDRG1
protein (2 μg) competitively blocked these interactions
(Figure 5A and 5B). These data suggest that increased
NDRG1 expression can enhance β-catenin functions
in HCC cells by preventing its degradation through
competitive inhibitory binding with GSK-3β and Nur77.

NDRG1 shRNA cells were significantly smaller than
those from control shRNA cells (Figure 6A). Using CoIP, we detected NDRG1-GSK-3β and NDRG1-Nur77
interaction complexes in tumor lysates of control groups
from both Hep3B and HepG2 xenografts, but not in their
respective NDRG1 shRNA groups (Figure 6B). Since
the solid tumors are expected to be hypoxic, Hep3B
xenografts represent Hep3B cells cultured under hypoxia,
and therefore also have high levels of NDRG1 with
corresponding interactions with GSK-3β and Nur77.
Using Western blot, we observed expected
decreased levels of β-catenin and its downstream
target gene Cyclin D1 after NDRG1 knockdown in
the xenografts (Figure 6C). Correspondingly, the
levels of GSK-3β-9ser were decreased (indicating
enhanced GSK-3β activity), while Nur77 levels
were increased, which might account for enhanced
β-catenin degradation when NDRG1 was suppressed.
Immunohistochemistry verified these results, showing
that NDRG1 suppression decreased β-catenin
expression and prevented its nuclear accumulation, with
concomitant reductions of Cyclin D1, GSK-3β 9ser, and
enhanced Nur77 (Figure 6D).

Suppression of NDRG1 in vivo decreased β-catenin

To further confirm the role of NDRG1-GSK-3β
and NDRG1-Nur77 interactions in vivo, we inoculated

on immunohistochemical signal intensities indicated that

0.001), and β-catenin (│R│= 0.32, p = 0.003) (Figure 7).
The intensity of each protein expression has been shown in
Supplementary Figure 2. Overall, HCC tissues with higher
NDRG1 levels also have higher GSK-3β 9ser, Nur77, and
β-catenin levels. This observation is consistent with our
hypothesis that high levels of NDRG1 promote β-catenin
accumulation via competitive binding of NDRG1 with
GSK-3β and Nur77, thereby preventing its degradation.

is associated with high levels of β-catenin accumulation
and activity (Figure 8). This may in part account for
over-activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling observed in HCC,
which in turn promotes tumor progression and leads to
aggressive tumor phenotypes.
Indeed, dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway with nuclear accumulation of β-catenin has been
associated with carcinogenesis [11]. In HCC, a wholegenome sequencing study of 88 pairs of matched HCC
tumor/normal liver indicated that β-catenin is the most
frequently mutated oncogene (15.9%) [12]. The cellular
levels of β-catenin are tightly regulated by several distinct
pathways including GSK-3β/APC/Axin1 [13], Nur77
[9] and p53/Siah-1/APC [14]. Many components of
these destruction complexes are themselves frequently
mutated in human cancer; therefore, novel approaches
to reactivate these β-catenin destruction pathways may
potentially have therapeutic significance in the multiple
cancer types that present with over-activation of β-catenin.
As an example, we demonstrated here that NDRG1 binds
to both GSK-3β and Nur77 in HCC cells, resulting in
reduced β-catenin degradation and subsequent nuclear
accumulation; therefore approaches to inhibit these
protein-protein interactions could potentially enhance
β-catenin degradation and suppress β-catenin-mediated
oncogenic activities with desirable anti-tumor effects.
NDRG1 has been reported to be involved in the Wnt/
β-catenin signaling pathway. For example, NDRG1 was
demonstrated to be a physiological substrate of GSK-3β
[15], to interact directly with β-catenin [16], and with the
Wnt co-receptor, LRP6 [17]. The functional consequences
of such interactions appear to depend on specific cellular
stresses, genetic and epigenetic backgrounds, and the

DISCUSSION
The over-expression of NDRG1, a hypoxiainducible protein, is associated with aggressive HCC
phenotypes and with poor patient survival [5, 6]. To
further understand the biological roles of NDRG1 in
hepatocarcinogenesis, we used a protein microarray screen
and identified GSK-3β and Nur77 as two novel interaction
partners of NDRG1. Both GSK-3β and Nur77 mediate
β-catenin degradation, suggesting a role of NDRG1 in
β-catenin regulation. We showed that NDRG1 directly
binds to GSK-3β and Nur77, which competitively disrupts
binding of GSK-3β and Nur77 to β-catenin, thereby
preventing β-catenin degradation and enhancing β-catenin
accumulation in the nucleus (with subsequent activation of
downstream events including up-regulation of oncogenic
target genes such as Cyclin D1). Our results confirmed a
mechanistic link between NDRG1 and the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway, and provide evidence that high levels
of NDRG1 (either endogenously or induced by hypoxia)

tumor microenvironment. In prostate cancer, NDRG1
functions as a metastasis suppressor through its regulation
of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway: (1) NDRG1 interacts
with LRP6 to block Wnt/ β-catenin signaling which
orchestrates a signaling network to impair metastasis [17];
(2) It activates GSK-3β by promoting its phosphorylation
at Tyr279/216 to reduce total β-catenin levels [17]; (3) It
suppresses the TGF-β induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) through facilitating adherents complex
formation by maintaining the cell membrane location
of E-cadherin and β-catenin [18]; (4) It inhibits Wnt/βcatenin signaling through FRAT1 and PAK4 [19]. On
the contrary, our observations demonstrate that NDRG1
is an oncogenic activator in HCC, possibly through its
competitive binding with GSK-3β and Nur77 which
reduces β-catenin degradation and enhances β-catenin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcriptional activation of its downstream oncogenes. In
HCC specifically, the suppression of NDRG1 expression
and function, including disruption of its interactions with
GSK-3β and Nur77, are all potential means of therapeutic
interventions, although in prostate cancer, the reverse may
be beneficial. Thus, each cancer type needs to be evaluated
individually for the appropriate intervention based on the
specific roles of NDRG1 in that cancer.
Additionally, we show that regardless of the
mutation status of CTNNB1, suppression of NDRG1
remains effective at reducing β-catenin levels and
subsequent transcriptional activity. The cell lines used
in this study represent different molecular subclasses
of HCC, including HepG2 (which carries the 92 kDa
wild-type β-catenin as well as the 73 kDa truncated
β-catenin [20]), and Huh7 (which carries wild-type

β-catenin) [21]. The truncated form of β-catenin has
amino acids 25–140 deleted at N-terminal, which
removes the GSK-3β binding site [20], causing
accumulation of β-catenin in the cells. Thus, in HepG2
cells, truncated β-catenin does not interact with GSK3β, but the wild-type β-catenin remains regulated via
GSK-3β. Desbois-Mouthon et al reported that inhibition
of GSK-3β through LiCl increased the amount of wildtype β-catenin in cytosolic extracts without modifying
the level of truncated β-catenin [22]. Consistently, our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

study also demonstrated that suppression of NDRG1
caused GSK-3β activation only through a decrease in
wild-type β-catenin without any effects on truncated
β-catenin. Our data suggest that NDRG1 simultaneously
interacts with two important controllers (GSK-3β and
Nur77) of β-catenin, indicating its key involvement in
regulating β-catenin levels and activity, and that the
targeting of NDRG1 provides a broader and potentially
more effective means of attenuating β-catenin-mediated
oncogenic activities.

Like NDRG1, Nur77 (also called TR3 or NR4A1) is
a hypoxia-inducible protein that plays either pro-malignant
or anti-malignant roles depending on the cancer cell type
and cellular environment [23]. Nur77 is an orphan member
of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates many
cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis of cancer cells [24]. Sun et al reported
that Nur77 induced GSK-3β-independent degradation
of β-catenin through direct interaction with β-catenin
in the cytoplasm [9]. Furthermore, the Nur77 agonists,
ATE-i2-b4 [9], H-9 [9], Cns-B [25] and its analogue
Cns-A [26], suppressed both in vitro and in vivo growth
of cancer cells through inducing cytoplasmic expression
of Nur77 and its nuclear export [9]. In colon cancer,
hypoxia was reported to enhance Nur77 and β-catenin
expressions synergistically, stimulating colorectal cancer
cell migration, invasion, and EMT [23]. We report that
both Nur77 and NDRG1 are over-expressed in HCC
cells and patient specimens, and that these two proteins
interact to regulate β-catenin turnover. This interaction
may potentially impact other cellular functions or
signaling pathways regulated by either of these proteins,
with resulting anti-tumor effects as observed by our
in vivo data. Thus, further mechanistic studies of these two
proteins in the context of HCC may be warranted, as they
may offer new insights into hepatocarcinogenesis as well
as therapeutic interventions.
The expression of NDRG1 in HCC is induced
by hypoxia, through the HIF-1α transcription factor.
We previously demonstrated that NDRG1 expression
is associated with vascular invasion in HCC patients,
and that it regulates cell invasion, which are molecular
events mediated by hypoxia [6, 27]. We also showed
that suppression of NDRG1 in HCC may indeed provide
therapeutic benefits through its effects on cell viability,
cell cycle progression, and cellular senescence [8].
By inference, the inhibition of HIF-1α is expected to
inhibit NDRG1 expression and therefore also achieve
these therapeutic effects. Sorafenib, a multiple tyrosine
kinase inhibitor used as standard of care for advanced
HCC patients, is known to inhibit HIF-1α synthesis
[28]. We observed that sorafenib inhibited HIF-1α and
NDRG1 expressions in Hep3B and HepG2 cells under
hypoxia, concomitant with decreases in β-catenin, GSK3β 9ser, Nur77 (nuclear only), and cyclin D1 levels
(Supplementary Figure 3). The cytoplasmic levels of
Nur77 were enhanced. Thus, the anti-tumor efficacy of
sorafenib may in part be mediated through its indirect
inhibition of NDRG1 expression and functions. Indeed,
sorafenib was reported to decrease Wnt/β-catenin activity
in HCC cells in vitro, and to partially disrupt the activation
of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in HCC xenografts [29]. It was
also demonstrated to sensitize HCC cells to cisplatin
treatment through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
[30]. Sorafenib therefore represents a pharmacological
means to indirectly inhibit the expression and functions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of NDRG1, and suggests that sorafenib may be combined
with other NDRG1-based therapeutic interventions to
achieve synergistic anti-tumor effects in advanced HCC
patients with aggressive phenotypes.
In conclusion, we present new data that NDRG1
regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HCC
cells, through its direct interactions with GSK-3β and
Nur77 to prevent β-catenin degradation. The disruption
of protein-protein interactions, which are signaling hubs
that link and transmit oncogenic signals across various
molecular networks, offer a potentially effective means
of halting oncogenic signaling (e. g. inhibition of p53
and MDM2 interaction by Nutlins) [31, 32]. Our data
allows us to further understand the biological processes
underlying NDRG1-associated tumor aggressiveness,
and also suggests new avenues for developing therapeutic
approaches for HCC, such as through the disruption of
NDRG1 interaction with GSK-3β and/or Nur77.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The HCC cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7,
PLC/PRF/5, HepG2-Luc(+) and Hep3B-Luc(+) were
maintained in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and
1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were incubated in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Where appropriate, cells were treated with the chemicals
LY294002 (LY) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers,
MA) [33]; or Cns-A (Cytosporone A n-amyl ester,
compound 10i) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) [26] at 10
μM final concentration, for 48 hours.

Cloning, protein purification, and protein
microarray screening
Full length NDRG1 protein was amplified from
pcDNA 3.0 NDRG1 vector using the following primers:
upstream (5′- TTT GGA TCC GGT AAG CCT ATC CCT
AAC CCT CTC CTC GGT CTC GAT TCT ACG ATG
TCT CGG GAG ATG CAG GAT G -3′), and downstream
(5′- TTT CTC GAG CTA GCA GGA GAC CTC CAT
GGA CTT G -3′). The PCR reaction was performed in
a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) under the following conditions: heat
activation of the polymerase for 5 min at 95°C, followed
by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 2 min; with a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. The PCR-amplified product of the NDRG1 coding
region is constructed into the BamHI and XhoI sites of
vector pet28A (Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany).
Recombinant V5-NDRG1 peptide was generated in E.
coli (strain BL21, DE3) with IPTG induction, and native
NDRG1 protein was purified using Ni-NTA Superflow
29856

Oncotarget

Immunofluorescence staining

Agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of V5-NDRG1
protein was measured by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Purified V5-NDRG1 protein was confirmed
using Coomassie blue staining and Western blotting using
V5-HRP secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The purified V5-NDRG1 protein was used to
probe the Human ProtoArray® protein microarray
v5.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, ProtoArray slides were
pre-blocked with blocking buffer, and then incubated
for 90 min at 4°C with 1 μg V5-NDRG1 diluted in PBS
buffer, with gentle shaking. Slides were then washed four
times with 5 ml PBS. Alexa Fluor® 647 Anti-V5 Antibody
(1 μg/mL; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was then added
and incubated for 90 min at 4°C with gentle shaking.
Slides were then washed again four times with PBS, and
dried. Dried slides were scanned using GenePix 4000B
(Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA), and
images analyzed using ProtoArray Prospector (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).

Cells were seeded on the chamber slide and fixed
with ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and
blocked with 1% BSA for one hour. Cells were stained
for indicated primary antibodies and secondary antibody,
and then visualized using an Eclipse E600 image analysis
system (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Induction of hypoxia
Cells were plated at the desired density 24 hours
prior to placement in a hypoxia chamber maintained at
0.5% oxygen for desired time periods depending on
the experiment. Alternatively, hypoxia was induced
chemically by incubating the plated cells in GasPak
pouches for anaerobic culture (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

siRNA transfection
Target specific siRNA (20 nM) against NDRG1
(Ambion, Austin, TX) was transfected into cells in 6-well
plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
siRNA sequences are: NDRG1 siRNA: 5- GCU GAU
CCA GUU UCC GGA Att-3.

Protein extraction and Immunoblotting
For Western blotting, cells were lysed with T-PER
Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Protein lysates suspended
in loading buffer were resolved via SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was incubated with the
desired primary antibody, followed by incubation with
appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The
protein expression was detected by SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Primary antibodies used are: NDRG1, Nur77
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK); p-Rb, GSK-3β, GSK-3β-9ser,
Histone 3 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA);
β-catenin, p16, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies used are: goat anti-rabbit
and goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA).

Immunohistochemistry of patient samples and
mouse xenografts
Clinical samples were collected from HCC patients
who underwent hepatectomy at Stanford Hospital (Palo
Alto, California, USA). This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Stanford University, and
all patients signed informed consent forms prior to tissue
collection. Immunohistochemical staining was performed
following standard protocol as previously described [8].
Sections were developed using Dako EnVision System
and were then counterstained with hematoxylin (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark). Images were viewed with Nikon
epifluorescent upright microscope E600 (Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan). Slides were scored based on the signal intensities
(0 – negative; 1– low expression, positive cells present
in < 50% of the entire area; 2– high expression, positive
cells present in > 50% of the entire area). Xenograft tumor
tissues were collected from mice and stained following
standard immunohistochemical protocol [8].

Co-immunoprecipitation assay
Total protein (500 μg) in cell lysates were incubated
with 2 μg anti-NDRG1 or anti-β-catenin antibody at
4°C for 2 hours; 20 μl A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were then added
into each sample and incubated at 4°C overnight. After
incubation, the beads were separated from the lysis buffer
and washed three times in cold PBS. Immunocomplexes
were resuspended in 2x loading buffer, heat-denatured,
and centrifuged; supernatants were collected and
resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel,
and immunoblotting was performed with antibodies as
indicated.

Subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice
HepG2-Luc(+) and Hep3B-Luc(+) cells (1 × 106 each)
stably transfected with control-shRNA or NDRG1-shRNA
were injected into 4 weeks old nude mice (Charles River
Laboratories International Inc., Wilmington, MA) to induce
subcutaneous tumor formation. Cells with control-shRNA
29857

Oncotarget

were injected into the left shoulders and cells with NDRG1shRNA were injected into the right shoulders (n = 8 for each
group). Doxycycline (200 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) was added daily into the drinking water of nude mice.
Whole body luminescence intensity and tumor size were
measured weekly. After 4 weeks, the mice were sacrificed
and tumor tissues harvested for further investigations.
