ABSTRACT
Thyroid hormone (3,5,3’-triiodothyronine, T3; L-thyroxine, T4) enhances cancer
cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis via a discrete receptor located near the
RGD recognition site on αvβ3 integrin. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and its
nanoparticulate formulation interfere with binding of T3/T4 to the integrin. This
integrin is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM) and other cancers. MM cells
interact with αvβ3 integrin to support growth and invasion. Matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) are a family of enzymes active in tissue remodeling and cancer. The
association between integrins and MMPs secretion and action is well established.
In the current study, we examined the effects of thyroid hormone on myeloma cell
adhesion, migration and MMP activity.
We show that T3 and T4 increased myeloma adhesion to fibronectin and induced
αvβ3 clustering. In addition, the hormones induced MMP-9 expression and activation
via αvβ3 and MAPK induction. Bortezomib, a standard myeloma treatment, caused a
decrease in activity/quantity of MMPs and thyroid hormone opposed this effect. RGD
peptide and tetrac impaired the production of MMP-9 in cell lines and in primary BM
cells from myeloma patients.
In conclusion, thyroid hormone-dependent regulation via αvβ3 of myeloma
cell adhesion and MMP-9 production may play a role in myeloma migration and
progression.

INTRODUCTION

Growing evidence has suggested that the
aggressiveness of MM cells and resistance to
chemotherapy is partly governed by cellular adhesion
between the MM cells and BM stromal cells (BMSCs)
as well as extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins, leading
to growth, proliferation and invasion of the malignant
clone[2, 3]. The progression and homing of MM cells
to the BM is facilitated by the proteolytic degradation
of ECM proteins and BM components by a family of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [4]. MMP-9 is one

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm
that primarily affects elderly patients [1]. MM is
characterized by the accumulation and localization of
malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), leading
to disordered hematopoiesis. Despite significant progress
in the management of MM with bortezomib and other
novel therapeutic agents, this disease remains highly
refractory to therapy[2].

of the most important members of the family and is
constitutively active in both human and murine MM cells,
contributing to cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis and
bone degradation [5-8]. The activation of MMP-9 is not
regulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6), the major myeloma cell
growth factor, or by other cytokines involved in multiple
myeloma [7].
It has recently been shown that integrin-mediated
cell interaction with matrix molecules, particularly
fibronectin, is the strongest inducer of MMP’s production
and activation in cells of lymphoid origin[9, 10]. Integrins
are a family of cell surface receptors that take part in the
interactions between BMSCs, ECM proteins and the MM
cells. Among these integrins, αvβ3 plays a pivotal role in
MM, engaging in adhesion, invasion and migration [1113]. We have recently shown that thyroid hormone, via a
novel receptor on the αvβ3 integrin[14] that is proximal
to the RGD recognition site, acts as growth factors in
MM [15]. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and its
nanoparticulate formulation (tetrac-NP) are selective T4/
T3 blockers at the αvβ3 integrin site16,17. In the current
work we were have pursued the effects of the hormones
on adhesion, migration and MMP-9 production—and
possibly to block these actions—in myeloma cell lines
as well as in primary bone marrow cells from myeloma
patients. We found that thyroid hormone increase plasma
cell adhesion to fibronectin and RGD and to increase cell
migration and MMP-9 activation. Moreover, the hormone
opposed MMP-9 reduction by bortezomib. These actions
are regulated via the αvβ3 integrin and are MAPKmediated. Disruption of the thyroid-integrin signaling
by use of RGD or tetrac, a specific blocker of the thyroid
hormone binding site upon the integrin[16, 17], impaired
the production of MMP-9 in myeloma cell lines and
primary BM cells from myeloma patients.

RESULTS

T3 (1 nM) or T4 (100 nM) overnight. The next day, the
cells were collected and an equal number of cells were
seeded on fibronectin/RGD pre-coated plates for 30 min
and the number of adhered cells was assessed. BSAcoated wells served as negative control. Results (Figure
1A) indicate that T3 and T4 increased cell adhesion
to RGD by 24% and 44% (p< 0.05), respectively. This
effect was further enhanced in fibronectin coated wells
by 66% (p< 0.05) following T3 treatment and by 98%
(p< 0.005) in T4 treated cells. Representative images
from fibronectin-coated wells are depicted in Figure 1B.
The cells were further stained by PE-conjugated αvβ3
integrin antibody (LM609) and by a nuclear dye (Hoechst
33342). Representative results (Figure 1C) indicate that
T3 and T4 increase αvβ3 abundance on fibronectin- and
RGD-adhered cells. Next, to study the effect of thyroid
hormones on directional cell migration in vitro, a scratch
wound healing assay was conducted (Figure 1D). CAG
cells (100,000/96-well plate), under serum-free conditions,
were plated and a gap in the cell monolayer was created.
Fresh T3 (1 nM) or T4 (100 nM) was added every day
for 24-96 h. Images were captured by light microscopy
equipped with a camera, at the beginning (0 hours) and at
regular intervals during cell migration to close the wound
(24, 48, 72h). The gap borders throughout the experiment
are marked by white dashed lines. Cell migration and
growth towards the center of the gap, thereby filling up the
gap, was observed in T3 and T4 treated cells and occurred
on a time-dependent basis. In untreated cells, a lower
migration rate was seen. To further facilitate visualization
of closure of the gap borders, cells from the same
experiments, after 96h of incubation, were stained for cell
nucleus (Hoechst 33342) and actin filaments (Phalloidin)
and imaged using a fluorescent microscope. While the
gap borders remained almost at their original width
in untreated cells, closure of the gap borders following
treatments with both hormones was observed (Figure 1E).

Thyroid hormone increases MM cell adhesion and

The
RGD
sequence
is
the
cell
attachment site of a large number of adhesive
extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin. The
interaction of myeloma plasma cells with these proteins
is involved in migration of the malignant clone. The
regulation of adhesion and migration by thyroid hormone
was previously reported in normal physiological processes
[18-21] and cancer [22, 23], but has not been implicated in
multiple myeloma.
In order to assess whether T3 and T4 could modulate
interactions between myeloma cells and fibronectin/RGD,
CAG myeloma cells (100,000/96-well plate) were grown
overnight under serum-free conditions and treated with

Migration of MM cells involves proteolytic
degradation of ECM proteins by MMP’s, primarily

on MMP-9 expression, secretion and activation. CAG
cells were seeded (100,000/96-well plate) under serumfree conditions for 24 h and treated overnight with T3 (1
nM) or T4 (100 nM) in triplicate. Cells were collected for
RNA extraction and results (Figure 2A) show a significant
(p< 0.005) increase in MMP-9 mRNA expression by T3
(1.54-fold) and T4 (1.4-fold). Next, MMP-9 protein levels
were measured in the conditioned medium of the cells.
The pro enzyme MMP-9 (92kD) is cleaved, yielding

in triplicates with the hormones in the presence/absence
of 0.1µg/mL αvβ3 blocking antibody (Clone LM609).
Concentrated conditioned medium samples were loaded
in two parallel gels and developed together. Results
(Figure 2B), from representative lanes (skipping lanes are
clearly marked by separating lines), indicate a significant
increase in the 88kD active form of MMP-9 in response
to T3 (1.66-fold, p<0.005) or T4 (1.74-fold, p<0.05) in
comparison to untreated cells. A significant reduction to
0.65 (p<0.005) was observed when the cells were treated
with the hormones in the presence of αvβ3 blocking
antibody, indicating involvement of the integrin. The next
step was to evaluate the effect of T3 (1 nM) or T4 (100
nM) on MMP-9 activation by performing gel zymography
in two MM cell lines, CAG (Figure 2C, left panel) and
RPMI-8226 (Figure 2C, right panel). An increase in the
active form of MMP-9 (88kD) was evident in both cell
lines. In CAG, 1.3-fold increase by T3 and 1.51-fold by
T4 (p<0.005) was documented and 1.3-fold increase by
T3 and a significant 2.3-fold increase by T4 (p<0.005)
were observed in RPMI-8226 cells. An increase in the prodimer MMP-9 (180kD) was also observed. Comparable
results were obtained in the ARK cell line (data not
shown). In order to assess whether thyroid hormonesinduced MMP-9 is MAPK dependent, CAG cells were
treated with the hormones in the presence or absence of
the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (1 µM). Results (Figure
2D) indicate that the induction of active MMP-9 protein
by T3 and T4 was significantly reduced (p<0.005) in the
presence of the MAPK inhibitor. Similar results were
obtained in RPMI-8226 cells (data not shown). Next,
we examined whether thyroid hormone may antagonize
the effect of bortezomib (25 nM) on MMP-9 level and
activation. CAG cells were incubated overnight with
bortezomib (25nM) in the presence or absence T3 (1 nM)
or T4 (100 nM). Bortezomib reduced MMP-9 activation
to 0.6 (Figure 2E) and protein level to 0.15 (Figure 2F)
which were significantly antagonized (p<0.005) in the
presence of either hormone. Similar results were obtained

in RPMI-8226 and ARK cells (data not shown).

Thyroid hormone activation of MMP-9 is downregulated by RGD peptide
After demonstrating that thyroid hormone induces
MMP-9 activation via the αvβ3 integrin, we attempted to
block this effect. As the hormone-binding site upon the
αvβ3 is near the RGD-recognition site and by using RGD
peptide the binding of the hormones to the integrin was
allosterically blocked [14, 24], we used RGD tri-peptide
to hinder the effects of the hormones on MMP-9. CAG
cells were treated overnight with T3/T4 (1 nM and 100
nM, respectively) in the presence or absence of several
RGD or negative control RGD concentrations (500 nM,
1 µM and 10 µM). Conditioned medium was collected,
concentrated and tested for MMP-9 enzymatic activity by
gel zymography. MMP-9 activation by T3 was blocked by
25% at the highest concentration of RGD (Figure 3A) and
T4-induced MMP-9 activation was significantly reduced
by 15-40%, in a dose-dependent manner (p< 0.05).
RGD peptide induced MMP-9 activation at nanomolar
concentrations. As expected, RGE peptide, used as a
negative control in the same experiment (untreated control
cells are depicted in Figure 3A, lane 1), did not block
thyroid hormones-mediated MMP-9 activation (Figure
3B). Similar results were observed in RPMI-8226 cells
(data not shown).

Tetrac, a selective T3/T4−αvβ3 antagonist, blocks
MMP-9 expression and activation
Tetrac was previously shown to block the thyroid
hormones-αvβ3 axis in various tumor models including
myeloma[15]. We were therefore interested in examining
the effect of tetrac on MMP-9 activity and whether it can
block thyroid hormones-induced MMP-9 activation. CAG

Figure 3: Thyroid hormone-induced MMP-9 activation is blocked by RGD peptide, but not RGE. CAG cells (100,000/96well plate) were incubated under serum-free conditions overnight with (A) RGD or (B) RGE at several concentrations (500 nM, 1 µM
and 10 µM) in the presence or absence of T3/T4 (1 nM, 100 nM). Conditioned medium was evaluated for MMP-9 activation by gel
zymography. Experiments were repeated twice in duplicate.

cells were treated with increasing tetrac concentrations (1
µM, 10 µM and 50 µM) for 24-48 h and gel zymography
was performed on the conditioned medium. Results
indicate that tetrac effectively blocked MMP-9 activity
in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 4A). Next,
CAG cells were treated with tetrac (100 nM and 1 µM)
with/without T3 (1 nM) or T4 (100 nM) and RNA was
extracted after an overnight incubation. Real-time PCR
results revealed that, at both 100 nM and 1 µg, tetrac alone
or in the presence of agonist thyroid hormones (T4 or T3),
inhibited MMP-9 mRNA expression (Figure 4B). The
inhibitory effect of tetrac on MMP-9 was further examined
by gel zymography in CAG cells treated overnight with
tetrac (100 nM, 1 µM and 10µM) in the presence of T3 (1
nM) or T4 (100 nM). Conditioned medium samples were
loaded in two parallel gels which were run and developed
together. Results (Figure 4C), from representative lanes
(skipping lanes are clearly marked by separating lines),
demonstrate that, in a dose-dependent manner, tetrac
effectively blocked MMP-9 activation by the hormones
(Figure 4C). Similar results were obtained in RPMI-8226
cells (data not shown). In a parallel set of experiments, the
inhibitory effect of tetrac on MMP-9 activity was observed
under serum-containing conditions in various myeloma
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1).

patients. Bone marrow (BM) aspirates were obtained
from 12 MM patients, 11 newly diagnosed and 1 at disease
relapse (supplementary Table 1). Mononuclear cells
(MNC) were separated by Ficoll-paque and the percentage
of plasma cells (CD-138 positive) was determined by flow
cytometry (supplementary Table 1) and ranged from 1596% (average 56 ± 27). Cells were treated with 100 nM
and 1 µM tetrac and tetrac-NP for 72-96 h and conditioned
medium was collected, concentrated and examined by
gel zymography. MMP-9 activity in each sample was
calculated as percentage from untreated cells (assigned a
value of 1 by definition, marked by a dashed line in Figure
5). Tetrac (Figure 5A) reduced MMP-9 activity below the
control level in 6 of 9 examined samples, while tetrac-NP
(Figure 5B) inhibited MMP-9 activity in 6 of 7 samples.
No effect on MMP-9 activity and protein level was shown
by both agents in control primary MNC (Supplementary
Figure 2).

MMP-9 activity as a single agent or adjunct to tetrac/
tetrac-NP. MNC from the BM of nine patients were
treated with bortezomib (25 nM) for 72-96 hours under
serum-containing media. A reduction in MMP-9 activity
by bortezomib was observed in four samples (Figure
5C, white circles). Next, six of the samples were cotreated with bortezomib and 100 nM tetrac (Figure 5C,

from different BM samples were heterogeneous, with
an additive effect in some samples while antagonism in
others. In details, in four samples (BM’s #3/4/6/7) MMP9 activity was reduced in the presence of the combined
treatment, while no effect (BM#1) or an antagonistic
effect (BM#5) was documented. Tetrac-NP, when
combined with bortezomib, further inhibited MMP-9
activity in three samples (BM’s #7/10/11), while in the
fourth sample (BM#12) an antagonistic effect was shown.

tetrac with/without bortezomib showing synergism (Figure

physiological processes. However, data regarding their
involvement in cancer cell adhesion is limited [22, 23]
with no reports in multiple myeloma. The interaction of
myeloma plasma cells with fibronectin was reported to
be via engagement with αvβ3 integrin [12] and proposed
as a novel mechanism for their invasion and spreading.
This integrin was recently shown, by our group, to be
upregulated in MM cells treated with T3 and T4 [15].
In accord with these observations, we now show that
the increased adhesion to fibronectin and RGD by the
hormones coincides with αvβ3 clustering upon the MM
plasma cells.
A role for the αvβ3 integrin in the production of
MMP-9 in myeloma has been reported [9, 12, 26]. This
enzyme has a central role in myeloma adhesion, motility
and invasion [5, 7, 12, 27-29]. In recent years thyroid
hormones involvement in MMP regulation was recognized
in normal tissues[18, 30, 31], amphibian development [32]
and cancer [33, 34], but not in myeloma. We therefore
investigated the effects of thyroid hormones on MMP-9
production in this disease and found that thyroid hormones
enhance MMP-9 transcription, protein secretion and
enzymatic activity via the αvβ3 integrin. This MMP9 activation was dependent on ERK phorphorylation,
as in previous reports [5, 29, 35]. Our current work

DISCUSSION
In our myeloma experimental model, thyroid
hormone increased adhesion to fibronectin and RGD,
and enhanced cell migration in a wound healing assay.
The regulation of adhesion and migration by T3 [1821] and by T4 [25], was previously reported in normal

demonstrates a novel effect by thyroid hormone via the
αvβ3-MAPK axis, a pathway which has been shown to
mediate the mitogenic effects of the hormones in myeloma
[15].
Given the relevance of MMPs to cancer progression,
several MMP inhibitors are under clinical studies [36].
The proteasome is a major cellular protease complex that
controls the concentration and turnover of molecules in
ECMs, including MMPs [37]. The down-regulation of
MMP-9 protein levels by bortezomib, the first proteasome
inhibitor in the clinic, has been documented in lung cancer
[38], squamous cell carcinoma [39], bladder carcinoma
[40], breast cancer cells [41]and myeloma cells [42]. The
inhibition of MMP-9 by bortezomib may be due partly to
blocking of the activation and nuclear translocation of NF, which was reported to regulate MMP-9 transcription
kB
[43]. We present for the first time in myeloma cells that
the inhibition by bortezomib of the secreted and activated
form of MMP-9, an effect that is antagonized by T3 and
T4.
Overall, our novel findings suggest that thyroid
hormones might have pleiotropic effects in the process
of MM cell trafficking and homing. Therefore, disruption
of the thyroid hormones-integrin-MMP-9 signaling may
be of importance in myeloma treatment. The effects
of two αvβ3 blockers, RGD tri-peptide as well as the
specific antagonist tetrac, were studied in myeloma. RGD
exhibited a differential effect on thyroid hormone-induced
MMP-9 activation. This sub-specialization was previously
reported with regard to MAPK and viability [15] and may
be due to the existence of two distinctive binding domains
for T3 and T4 at the receptor for thyroid hormone on
αvβ3 integrin [24]. In our experimental assay RGD, at
low nanomolar concentrations, greatly induced MMP-9
activity. This agonistic activity by RGD coincides with
previous report indicating stimulation of tumor growth and
angiogenesis at low nanomolar concantrations[44]. Tetrac
effectively disrupted MMP-9 induction and release by both
hormones. This agent has been shown previously to inhibit
additional MMP family members (MMP-15 and MMP-19)
and induce tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)
in an angiogenic model [45]. MMP inhibitory activity
was also shown by resveratrol [46], for which there is a
specific receptor proximal to the thyroid hormone/tetrac
binding site on αvβ3 [47-49].
In an attempt to demonstrate direct effects on
malignant cells with relevant impact on their relationship
with the surrounding milieu, tetrac and its nanoparticulate
formulation (tetrac-NP) were also examined in
mononuclear cells from MM bone marrow samples. Our
results indicate that tetrac and tetrac-NP, at low molar
concentrations, effectively blocked MMP-9 production
in the majority of samples examined while no effect was
observed in a control BM sample. When we examined
whether tetrac can be combined with bortezomib, results
from different BM samples were heterogeneous, with an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

additive effect in some samples and antagonism in others.
Whether tetrac could be combined with bortezomib or
other anti-myeloma drugs, is under active investigation.
To conclude, we have examined the role of thyroid
hormones on multiple myeloma cell adhesion, migration
and MMP-9 secretion. We demonstrated that thyroid
hormones promote the adhesion of myeloma cells and
that this interaction triggers clustering of αvβ3 integrin
and the biosynthesis of the matrix degrading enzyme,
MMP–9. The thyroid hormone-dependent regulation of
MMP-9-integrin interactions defines a novel mechanism
that may play a role in myeloma cell migration and disease
progression.

METHODS
Cell lines and primary cells
MM cell lines CAG (established at the Arkansas
Cancer Research Center from bone marrow aspirates of
patients with MM) and RPMI-8226, U266 (CCL 155
and TIB-196, respectively, ATCC; Rockville, MD, USA)
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS/antibiotics. Bone marrow
(BM) aspirates were obtained upon written consent from
12 MM patients (Supplementary Table 1) treated at the
Meir Medical Center (51-89 years old). The Meir Medical
Center Helsinki committee approved this study (#020512-MMC). 11 samples were taken at diagnosis and one
during disease relapse. Another sample served as control
and was taken from a patient with an infectious disease
and without any bone marrow involvement. The BM
mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque
gradient centrifugation per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Percentage of
plasma cells (CD-138+) and their isotype was evaluated
by flow cytometry. For experiments, the cells were seeded
in 96-well plates (100,000 cells/well) in serum-containing/
free RPMI 1640 medium and treated with T3 (1 nM), T4
(100 nM), tetrac or tetrac-NP (100 nM-100 µM) with or
without bortezomib (25 nM) for 24-96 h.

Reagents and chemicals
T3, T4 and tetrac (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) were dissolved to 1 mM in KOH-PG (final
concentration of 0.04 N KOH with 0.4% polyethylene
glycol (vol/vol). RGD/RGE peptides (Sigma) were
dissolved to 100mM in PBS). Bortezomib was obtained
from the oncology pharmacy at Meir Medical Center.
Vehicle control was used in each experiment. APCCD138 antibodies (clone B-B4) were from Miltenyi

Chemicon International, Harrow, UK. U0126 was
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA and MMP-9 antibody (#3852) was obtained from
Cell Signaling (Boston, MA, USA).

RNA was extracted using NucleoSpine RNA II kit
(Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 40 µL RNase
free water. RNA concentration and purity were measured
using NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo

Adhesion assay
For adhesion assays 96-well plates were pre-coated
for 30 minutes with fibronectin (15 µg/mL), RGD (2.5
µg/mL) or BSA (10 µg/mL), washed twice with PBS
and blocked for 30 minutes in BSA (2mg/mL). CAG
cells were seeded (100,000 cells/24-well plate) under
serum-free conditions for 24 hours before the addition of
T3 (1 nM) or T4 (100 nM) for an overnight incubation.
Afterwards cells were collected, counted and an equal
number of cells were re-seeded for 30 minutes in 37º C in
the pre-coated plates (50,000/96-well plate). Unattached
cells were washed twice with PBS and adhered cells were
stained with Hoechst 33342. Cells were visualized by a
florescent microscopy equipped with a camera (Model
IX71, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) with a 20X/0.50
objective lens and Cell^A (Version 3.1) Olympus software
imaging.

Real-Time PCR
MMP-9 mRNA levels were measured by RealTime PCR (7500 Fast system, Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), using Fast Sybr Green Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Results, normalized to actin beta, were
calculated as fold change using the comparative threshold
cycle method (2-ΔΔCT) relative to control cells (i.e.,
controls are assigned a value of 1 by definition). Primers
(Hylabs, Israel) were designed (Primer‑Express software,
Applied‑Biosystems) in different exons in order to elimi­
nate DNA contamination.

Immunofluorescence
Treated cells were fixed and permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton x-100 for 5 min at room temperature
and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- labeled
Phalloidin (A12379, Molecular Probs, Inc, OR, USA )
and PE-conjugated αvβ3 antibody (LM609, Chemicon
International). Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear
staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were visualized by a
fluorescent microscopy equipped with a camera (Model
IX71, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) with a 20X/0.50
objective lens and Cell^A (Version 3.1) Olympus software
imaging.

Western blotting
Equal numbers of MM cells were seeded and
treated, then equal volumes of conditioned medium from
each experiment were collected and 12-fold concentrated
by centrifugal filter devices for proteins with molecular
weight over 30kD (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). Half of
the concentrated supernatant (20 µL) was separated
on 10% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by western
blot, using above indicated primary antibodies and
appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA, USA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by
chemiluminescence reagents (Beit-Ha’emek, Israel).
Ponceau (Sigma Aldrich) was used for quantitation to
normalize the proteins loaded onto the membrane. Band
intensity was visualized and quantified using LAS-3000
(FujiFilm, Japan).

Wound healing assay
CAG cells were seeded (100,000 cells/96-well
plate) and starved for 48 h in serum-free media. Each
well was scratched in the middle and T3 (1 nM) or T4
(100 nM) were added for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Cells
were visualized by light and florescent microscopy
equipped with a camera (Model IX71, Olympus,
Hamburg, Germany) with a 20X/0.50 objective lens
and Cell^A (Version 3.1) Olympus software imaging
at each time point. After 96 h, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton
x-100 for 5 min. 1% BSA was used for blocking, followed
by Hoechst and Phalloidin staining.

confluent culture conditions (about 70 – 80%) were
incubated with the different treatments for the indicated
times. Equal volumes of supernatant (500 µL) were
collected and concentrated 12-fold by centrifugal filter
devices for proteins with molecular weight over 30kD
(Amicon Ultra, Millipore). Half of the concentrated
supernatant (20 µL) was taken for gel zymography and
were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions
on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels impregnated with 1
mg/mL of gelatin before casting. Gels were washed for
30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove the SDS, then
incubated overnight at 37°C in digestion buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl and 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). Gels were stained
with Coomassie Blue (R250) for 30 min and destained
with methanol:acetic acid:water (50:10:40). Areas of
protease activity appeared as clear bands on a dark blue
background. Band intensity was visualized and quantified
using LAS-3000 (FujiFilm, Japan) and normalized to for
18 h at 37°C.
