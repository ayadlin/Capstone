Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Alternative mRNA splicing is the main reason vast mammalian proteomic complexity can be
achieved with a limited number of genes. Splicing is physically and functionally coupled to
transcription, and is greatly affected by the rate of transcript elongation1,2,3. As the nascent premRNA emerges from transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), it is assembled into a messenger
ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle which is its functional form and determines the fate of the
mature transcript4. However, factors that connect the transcribing polymerase with the mRNP
particle and help integrate transcript elongation with mRNA splicing remain obscure. Here, we
characterized the interactome of chromatin-associated mRNP particles. This led to the
identification of Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 (DBC1) and a protein we named ZIRD as subunits of
a novel protein complex, named DBIRD, which binds directly to RNAPII. DBIRD regulates
alternative splicing of a large set of exons embedded in A/T-rich DNA, and is present at the
affected exons. RNAi-mediated DBIRD depletion results in region-specific decreases in transcript
elongation, particularly across areas encompassing affected exons. Together, these data indicate
that DBIRD complex acts at the interface between mRNP particles and RNAPII, integrating
transcript elongation with the regulation of alternative splicing.
The composition of mRNP particles has been the subject of a number of studies, using a
variety of approaches (see, for example, ref5 and references therein). There are likely to be
different types of mRNP particles with distinct compositions and interaction partners. We

sought to specifically purify native mRNP particles and interacting proteins from the
chromatin in which they are generated and active in co-transcriptional processes. As a
starting point, we generated HEK293 cells expressing near-normal levels of Flag-tagged
hnRNP A1 (A1), an abundant hnRNP protein in human cells6. A1 shuttles between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm7, but at steady state it is mainly nuclear and concentrated in
chromatin (Fig. 1a), from where it can be released by RNAse A treatment (Fig. 1b, compare
lanes 2 and 4). We used DNAse I digestion and mild sonication to release mRNP particles
from chromatin for purification. RNAse inhibitors were present during the whole process,
outlined in Fig. 1c. mRNP particles isolated by this approach are predominantly of nuclear
(chromatin) origin (Suppl. Fig. S1). Native mRNP particles and their interacting partners
were purified from chromatin isolated from ~108 nuclei (Fig. 1d). Only two major bands
(namely the added, proteinaceous RNAse inhibitors) were detected upon purification from
control cells (left panel), while numerous proteins were detected in A1-flag elutions (right
panel). These represent a heterogeneous mixture of core mRNP particle subunits and
proteins interacting with such particles. Individual protein bands were excised and identified
by mass spectrometric analysis (subset indicated in Fig. 1d; see also list in Suppl. Fig S2a).
Most of the known ‘core’ mRNP proteins, such as the hnRNP proteins were present in the
purified fraction, confirming the biological relevance of this approach. Many other premRNA processing proteins were also identified, including splicing factors, ATP-dependent
RNA helicases, and a substantial number of mRNA 3′-end processing and termination
factors. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments confirmed the RNA-dependent
interaction of some of these proteins with A1-Flag (Suppl. Fig. S2b).

We next focused on two proteins that had not previously been connected to mRNP particles
or mRNA processing. One of these, DBC1, is otherwise best known for its association with
and regulation of the sirtuin-like deacetylase SIRT18,9. We also investigated the
uncharacterized zinc finger-containing protein ZNF326. Stable cell lines expressing nearnormal levels of Flag-tagged versions of these proteins were established, and co-IP
experiments confirmed that both DBC1 and ZNF326 interact with mRNP particles in an
RNA-dependent manner (Suppl. Fig. S3a-f). Furthermore, we discovered that ZNF326 and
DBC1 associate directly, in an RNA-independent manner (Fig. 2a and e). We therefore
renamed ZN326 as ZIRD (ZNF-protein Interacting with nuclear RNPs and DBC1).
We previously identified DBC1 as an RNAPII-interacting protein in another proteomic
screen10, making it a particularly interesting candidate. Co-IP experiments confirmed that
RNAPII associates with DBC1-Flag, in an RNA-independent manner (Fig. 2b). ZIRD was
detected in RNAPII (RPB3-Flag) purifications as well, and this interaction was also RNAindependent (Fig. 2c). In further support of a ZIRD-RNAPII interaction, ZIRD-Flag also
brought down RNAPII (Fig. 2d). In contrast, we failed to detect an interaction between A1
and RNAPII under the same conditions (Fig. 2c, middle panel, and data not shown),
although co-IP experiments after formaldehyde cross-linking indicated that, as expected, the
proteins are in close proximity in vivo (Suppl. Fig. S4). Together, these results indicate that
DBC1 and ZIRD are not part of the core mRNP particle, but that they might work at the
interface between the mRNP particle and RNAPII.
Others reported that DBC1 interacts with SIRT18,9. While we confirmed that DBC1 coprecipitates SIRT1, endogenous ZIRD and ZIRD-Flag did not (Fig. 2e, and data not shown).
SIRT1 is also absent from A1-containing mRNP particles (Suppl. Fig. S3g). This indicates
that ZIRD and DBC1 form a complex that lacks SIRT1. To further characterize ZIRDDBC1 interaction, ZIRD-Flag was purified. Size exclusion chromatography of highly
purified material showed that ZIRD-Flag and DBC1 are part of a salt-stable ~800 kDa
complex (Fig. 2f, upper two panels), which also co-purified on MonoQ (data not shown). As

expected, SIRT1 is not part of this protein complex (Fig. 2g, and data not shown). We
named the complex DBIRD (DBC1/ZIRD complex).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

DBC1 and ZIRD interact with RNAPII in crude extracts (Fig. 2b-d). To investigate if this
interaction is direct, DBIRD complex was characterized by gel-filtration after mixing with
an excess of RNAPII. In the absence of RNAPII, the DBIRD complex peaked in fractions
13-15 (Fig. 2f, upper two panels). However, when mixed with RNAPII (Fig. 2f, lower three
panels), DBIRD complex elution shifted to earlier eluting fractions, peaking in fraction 10
with a sub-fraction of RNAPII, while polymerase alone peaked in fractions 17-19 (~500
kDa), as expected. DBIRD complex thus appears to form a bridging complex, which
interacts with both mRNP particles and RNAPII. Interestingly, DBIRD also interacted with
mRNP particles lacking hnRNP A1 (Fig. 2h), pointing to a general bridging role.
To examine the role of the DBIRD complex in transcription-associated processes in vivo,
we analysed the transcriptome of cells that had been depleted for DBC1 or ZIRD by RNAi
(Suppl. Fig. 5a). Total mRNA was hybridised to GeneChip HUMAN EXON 1.0 ST arrays,
on which the abundance of individual exons can be analyzed independently. In the absence
of ZIRD, a >1.5 fold increase in exon inclusion was observed in more than 2800 situations,
whereas exon exclusion was observed in only 390 cases (Suppl. Table T1a). The absence of
DBC1 led to increased inclusion of an exon in 796 cases (Suppl. Table T1b), and, strikingly,
the majority of these events were also on the list of ZIRD-dependent exon inclusions (567 of
796 = 71%; p-value for shared exons = 6.705e-261; Suppl. Table T1c), strongly supporting
the close functional relationship between the two factors, and providing a high degree of
confidence in the genome-wide alternative splicing data-sets. The effect was at the level of
alternative splicing, as depletion of ZIRD or DBC1 only affected the expression of a very
small number of genes (Suppl. Fig. S6).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

A full list of inclusion events observed in both DBC1 and ZIRD-depleted cells is in Suppl.
Table T1c. Sample results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Suppl. Fig. S7). To
investigate whether DBIRD was present at affected exons, we performed RNA
immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments11. DBC1 and ZIRD bound the relevant exon in
mRNAs from seven tested genes, while other regions (or control tRNA) were either not
detected, or detected to a much lower extent (Fig. 3a and b; Suppl. Fig. S8). Interestingly,
some exons of the β-actin gene (whose splicing was unaffected by DBIRD depletion) had
significant levels of DBIRD complex (Suppl. Fig. S8), indicating that the interaction of
DBIRD with mRNA is not invariably correlated with DBIRD-dependent splicing changes.
To investigate the mechanism underlying exon inclusion, we first searched for sequence
motifs in the DNA encompassing the included exons, but failed to uncover other motifs than
those known to typify splice junctions. We then looked for nucleotide patterns that might be
overrepresented in the sequences surrounding the included exons by counting how often
each of the 1024 possible 5-mer oligonucleotides occurred. Intriguingly, A/T-rich 5-mers
were significantly enriched around included exons (Fig. 3c). The frequencies of the four
nucleotides in the regions around the splice sites were also analyzed. A and T were strongly
overrepresented around the splice sites of DBIRD-affected exons, as well as across the
exons themselves. (Fig. 3d). The observed difference in A/T content is sufficient to explain
the over-representation of A/T-rich 5-mers (Suppl. Fig. S9).
The A/T-rich DNA surrounding the affected exons might influence fundamental aspects of
transcription. Indeed, A- and T-tracts are difficult for RNAPII to transcribe, constituting
very efficient elongation pause sites in vitro12,13. To investigate the effect of DBIRD on
transcript elongation, we performed RNAPII chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analysis after DBIRD knockdown. As control, we also knocked down SIRT1 (Suppl. Fig.

5b). Remarkably, although overall transcription of RAD50 and SLC36A4 is not affected
(see Suppl. Fig. S7), depletion of DBC1 or ZIRD (but not SIRT1) dramatically affected
RNAPII transcription, distinctively in regions encompassing affected exons (Fig. 4; Suppl.
Fig. S11). Quantification of newly produced mRNA by Bromo-UTP incorporation/
immunoprecipitation supported the idea that elongation rates were decreased in these
regions (Suppl. Fig. S10). DBIRD depletion also affected RNAPII density at other genes
whose splicing was exon-specifically affected, while little or no change in RNAPII density
was observed at the unaffected β-actin control gene, even at exons that had an elevated
DBIRD level (Suppl. Fig. S11-12; Compare to Suppl. Fig. S8).
Our data support the idea that the DBIRD complex represents a new type of factor, which
functions at the interface between ‘core’ mRNP particles and RNAPII, affecting local
transcript elongation rates and alternative splicing at a subset of A/T-rich exon-intron
junctions (Graphic model in Suppl. Fig. S13). Interestingly, several studies have shown that
the rate of RNAPII elongation affects the efficiency of splicing, with slow elongation
favouring exon inclusion1,3. One possible explanation for our data is thus that DBIRD
complex acts as an elongation factor, which facilitates transcript elongation across A/T-rich
regions, and thereby affects alternative splicing of exons in these regions. It has also been
suggested that exons in the nascent pre-mRNA become tethered to the elongating
transcription complex14,15. Given that DBIRD binds both mRNPs and RNAPII, it might
affect such tethering as well, and thereby splicing.

Interestingly, DBC1 has been implicated in tumourigenesis as a potential tumour suppressor,
regulating apoptosis and cell survival16. Whether DBC1’s role in the DBIRD complex and
alternative splicing impacts on tumourigenesis is an interesting possibility, especially in
light of the recent finding that genes encoding components of the splicing machinery are
often mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders17. ZIRD has not
previously been characterized in human cells, but its mouse homologue, ZAN75, is highly
expressed in neuronal tissues18, suggesting that regulation of DBIRD complex might
contribute to tissue-specific splicing. Other proteins with homology to ZIRD and DBC1
exist in the human genome, raising the intriguing possibility that other DBIRD-like
complexes are specific for other sets of genes or exons, or are involved in other
transcription-related nuclear events.

METHODS SUMMARY
ORFs encoding A1, DBC1 and ZIRD were cloned into pIRESpuro (Clontech) with a Cterminal Flag tag. HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in 5% CO2 at
37°C. For proteomic analysis, nuclei were isolated from A1-Flag cells. These were
sonicated, DNAse I treated, and the sample cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant
subjected to M2 agarose (Sigma) chromatography. Proteins were eluted with 3xFLAG
peptide, and mass spectrometry performed as described10. DBIRD was purified by M2
agarose chromatography from nuclease-treated nuclear extract from cells expressing ZIRDFlag. DBIRD was analyzed by MonoQ, or size exclusion chromatography with or without
an excess of RNAPII. Stealth siRNAs were double transfected in HEK293 cells using
lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For microarray analysis, RNA was hybridized on Human
Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) using standard techniques (bioinformatics analysis
described in Full Methods). For assessment of exon abundance and transcript expression,
quantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers against affected and unaffected exons.
Primer details are available on request. RNA immunoprecipitation and ChIP assays were
performed as described11,19.

FULL METHODS
Plasmids and antibodies
ORFs encoding human A1, DBC1 and ZIRD (ZNF326) were cloned into pIRESpuro
(Clontech) with a Flag tag at the C-terminus. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-Flag, mouse
anti-Flag M2 and mouse anti-hnRNP C (Sigma); and mouse anti-pCTD mAb 4H8
(Millipore); rabbit anti-lamin B2 (Acris); rabbit anti-ZNF326 and mouse anti-A1 (Santa

Immunopurification of Native mRNPs
108 cells stably expressing A1-Flag were lyzed with cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris
HCl pH 7.9, 340 mM sucrose, 3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,
0.5% NP-40, protease inhibitors and 1 μl/ml RNasin Ribonuclease inhibitor (promega)) and
intact nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,500g for 15 min. Nuclei were washed with
cytoplasmic lysis buffer without NP-40 and then resuspended in DNAse I buffer (20 mM
Hepes pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors and 1μl/ml
RNasin). After 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, nuclei were sonicated using
Bioruptor® (diagenode), before DNAse I (Sigma) was added to the buffer and incubated 30
min at room temperature. Buffer was then brought to 250 mM KOAc and 1% triton X-100.
The sample was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min and the supernatant was

collected. For negative control purification, the same extracts were prepared from the same
amount of untagged cells.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The sample was then applied to M2 agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 4h at 4°C.
After binding, beads were washed extensively with washing buffer (20 mM Hepes pH7.9,
250 mM KOAc, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, protease
inhibitors and 1 μl/ml RNasin® Ribonuclease inhibitor). Finally, proteins were eluted by
using FLAG elution buffer (20 mM Hepes pH7.9, 100 mM KOAc, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT, 200 μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide, protease inhibitors and 1μl/ml RNasin® Ribonuclease
inhibitor). Eluates were resolved by 4-12% bis-Tris gradient SDS PAGE and revealed by
Sypro Ruby staining (Invitrogen).
Mass Spectrometric Analysis
Protein samples were reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin, using the Janus liquid
handling system (PerkinElmer, UK). The digests were subsequently analysed by LC-MS/
MS on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer, (ThermoScientific, San Jose, USA). LCMS/MS data were searched against a protein database (UniProt KB) using the Mascot search
engine programme (Matrix Science, UK)21. All data were interrogated manually.
Purification of the DBC-1/ZIRD complex

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Nuclei from ~109 ZIRD-Flag cells were isolated, washed as above, and then sonicated
(Bioruptor, 30sec ON/OFF cycles, max intensity for 15mins). Nucleic acids were digested
by adding 10,000 units/ml Benzonase (Novagen) and 30 μg/ml RNAse A (Sigma), and
incubating at 4°C for 1 hour. The nuclear extract was then brought to 250 mM KOAc and
the insoluble fraction removed by centrifugation (20,000g for 30 mins). The supernatant was
used for Flag-M2 chromatography. After extensive washes (60 column volumes 20 mM
Hepes-KOH pH 7.9, 0.5% Triton, 10% glycerol, 250 mM KOAc), bound proteins were
eluted in the same buffer but containing 0.5 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (and 100 mM KOAc).
The complex was then dialyzed into buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 10% Glycerol,
0.01% NP-40) containing 100 mM NaCl, prior to MonoQ PC 1.6/5 (GE Healthcare) or size
exclusion (Superose 6 PC 3.2/30; GE Healthcare) chromatography. Proteins were eluted
from MonoQ by a salt-gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. For size exclusion
chromatography, samples were loaded in buffer B (20 mM Hepes-KOH, 0.01% NP40, 10%
glycerol, 250 mM KOAc) with or without pre-incubation on ice with a 5- to 10-fold molar
excess of purified mammalian RNAPII, purified as described22. 50 μl fractions were
collected, and sizes were estimated by running protein size markers (Biorad) in parallel.
Microarray Analysis
RNAs were extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), DNAse I-treated on the column, labelled
and hybridized on Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) using standard techniques.
Three independent experiments were performed and used as real triplicate for data analysis.
We processed core probe level signals using RMA implemented in APT (apt-1.10.0,
Affymetrix) to generate quantile normalised probe set and gene level signal estimates. Probe
set to transcript cluster meta-grouping was obtained from Affymetrix. We removed control
probe sets from further analysis. For the gene level analysis, genes displaying a coefficient
of variance <0.05 were assumed uninformative and removed. We determined transcriptional
effects (dbc1 vs ctr, ZIRD vs ctr and dbc1 vs ZIRD) by linear model, moderating the tstatistics by empirical Bayes shrinkage. We selected differential genes using a 0.05 p-value
threshold via a nestedF method. The analysis was carried out using the limma package from
Bioconductor23.

To identify putative alternative splicing events we first filtered probe sets to reduce false
positive events. We removed all probe sets not localising to unique loci in the genome
(Affymetrix annotation). We removed all probe sets from transcripts identified as not
expressed in a given condition since it is not possible to determine alternative splicing
events against an untranscribed background. We defined a transcript as not being expressed
if less than half its member probe sets had a detection p-value (dabg value) <0.05 across all
replicates. We also removed probe sets displaying a dabg value >0.05 in all replicates in
both the conditions being considered. Genes with less than 3 probe sets after filtering were
also removed from the analysis. To identify pairwise alternative splicing events we fitted
transcript cluster specific linear models to probe set signal estimates and tested for
significant interaction between each probe set and gene level signal estimates across
pairwise conditions using a 0.01 p-value threshold and a nestedF method. In cases where
multiple probe sets mapped to a single exon, all probe sets had to be significant to be
included in the results. Once again the analysis was carried out using the limma package
from Bioconductor23.
Computational analysis of sequences around affected exons
In order to investigate sequence features that might explain the differential enrichment of
certain exons upon knock-down of ZIRD or DBC1, we selected a set of 505 exons that were
1.5-fold enriched in both the ZIRD- and the DBC1 knock-downs and which were neither the
first nor the last exon (to avoid including 5′ and 3′ UTRs in the following analyses). As a
negative control set, we further selected 3877 exons that were unaffected upon depletion of
ZIRD and which were also neither the first nor the last exon in the gene. We then prepared a
positive and a negative sequence set for both the 5′ and 3′ splice sites. For the 5′ splice site,
the positive set contained the regions from −200nt to +50nt around the 5′ splice sites of the
505 enriched exons. The negative control set contains corresponding regions for the 3877
unaffected exons. Analogously, the positive set for the 3′ splice site contained the region
from −50nt to +200nt around the 3′ splice sites of the 505 enriched exons, and the negative
set contained the corresponding regions of the 3877 unaffected exons.

The P-values in Suppl. Fig. S9 were obtained in the following way. Suppose ab to be a
dinucleotide and i a position around a splice site. We calculated the frequency Pexp(i,ab) of
ab that we would expect, given the frequency of ab in the negative set, Pneg(i,ab), and given
the frequencies in the positive (pos) and negative (neg) sets of mononucleotide a at position
i, and b at position i+1, respectively:

The P-values for the observed number of dinucleotides ab at position i were calculated by
approximating the binomial distribution with a normal distribution:

where N is the number of sequences in the set of affected exons, K is the number of
observed dinucleotes ab at position i, Np is the expected number of dinucleotides at i,

of dinucleotides at i, p = Pexp(i, ab).
Quantitative RT-PCR

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

RNAs were extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), DNAse I-treated on the column, and 1 μg
of total RNA was retro-transcribed using random primers and first strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Fermentas). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBr Green detection. Specific
primers against the alternatively spliced exon and unaffected exons were designed for
assessment of exon abundance and transcript expression. Sequences are available upon
request.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
ChIP assays were performed as described19, using 4H8, antibody (Abcam), or IgG antibody
as negative control, and then 1 hr with protein G/ Herring sperm DNA. The precipitated
DNA fragments were analyzed by real-time PCR with SYBr Green detection. Input DNA
was analyzed simultaneously and used for normalization.
RNA Immunoprecipitation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

RNA immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described11,24. Briefly, 107
HEK293 cells were crosslinked in 1% PFA for 10 mins, quenched with 0.125 M glycine for
5 mins, washed twice in PBS and finally harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8,
1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 U/500 μl RNAsin and protease inhibitors). Samples were
sonicated 15 mins at maximum power using Bioruptor (Diagenode) to obtain RNA
fragments 200-600 bases long, cleared by centrifugation, and diluted 10-fold in dilution
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 50 U/ml RNAsin
and protease inhibitors). Samples were pre-cleared by incubation with 100 μl of IgG agarose
beads (Sigma) for 2 hrs at 4°C. Anti-Flag M2 Resin (Sigma) was added and samples
incubated for 4 hrs at 4°C. IPs were washed 3 times in wash-buffer 150 (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, RNAsin (50 U/ml), protease
inhibitors), once in wash buffer 500 (same as above, but 500 mM NaCl), once in LiCl (10
mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 50 U/
ml RNAsin, protease inhibitors) and once in TE100 buffer (TE containing 100 mM NaCl, 50
U/ml RNAsin, protease inhibitors). Immunocomplexes were 3 times eluted in 150 μl elution
buffer (TE containing 100 mM NaCl, 200 μg/ml 3xFlag-peptide, 50 U/ml RNAsin) and
incubated for 30 mins at 37°C with 1 μl of proteinase K. Crosslinking was then reversed by
adding 9 μl of 5 M NaCl and incubating the samples at 65°C for 1 hr. Nucleic acids were
phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated and any remaining DNA was eliminated
with Turbo DNase (Ambion) treatment. RNAs were then reverse transcribed using random
primers and the cDNAs were used for subsequent PCR reaction using relevant primers.
Nuclear run-on analysis
Cells were rinsed in PBS, then in buffer A (20mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM
EGTA, 25% Glycerol, 1mM PMSF), and permeabilised in buffer A containing 0.02% Triton
X-100 for 3 mins at room temperature. The nascent RNA labelling reaction was carried out
in buffer A containing 2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.5 mM CTP, 0.2 mM BrUTP (Sigma)
and 25 U/ml RNAsin (Promega) for 15 mins at 37°C. In control reactions, normal UTP was
used instead of BrUTP. After BrU incorporation, cells were rinsed twice in PBS and total
RNA from nuclei of both labelled and control samples was isolated using TriPure Isolation
Reagent (Roche). 2 μg of BrdU antibody (Sigma; also recognizes BrU) was pre-incubated
with 20μl of Protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) per experimental condition. RNA was
then heated at 80°C for 10 mins and incubated with the beads at room temperature for 1 hr
with gentle shaking. The beads were washed 5 times in PBS/0.1% PVP containing RNAsin

eliminated with Turbo DNAse (Ambion). RNA was then reverse transcribed using random
primers and the cDNAs were used for subsequent PCR reaction using relevant primers.
