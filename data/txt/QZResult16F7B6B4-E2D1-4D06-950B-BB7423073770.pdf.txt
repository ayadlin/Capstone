Abstract
Kinase inhibitors such as imatinib have dramatically
improved outcomes for patients with gastrointestinal stromal
tumor (GIST), but many patients develop resistance to these
treatments. Although in some patients this event corresponds
with mutations in the GIST driver oncogenic kinase KIT, other
patients develop resistance without KIT mutations. In this
study, we address this patient subset in reporting a functional
dependence of GIST on the FGF receptor FGFR3 and its crosstalk with KIT in GIST cells. Addition of the FGFR3 ligand
FGF2 to GIST cells restored KIT phosphorylation during imatinib treatment, allowing sensitive cells to proliferate in the
presence of the drug. FGF2 expression was increased in imatinib-resistant GIST cells, the growth of which was blocked by

RNAi-mediated silencing of FGFR3. Moreover, combining KIT
and FGFR3 inhibitors synergized to block the growth of imatinib-resistant cells. Signaling crosstalk between KIT and FGFR3
activated the MAPK pathway to promote resistance to imatinib.
Clinically, an IHC analysis of tumor specimens from imatinibresistant GIST patients revealed a relative increase in FGF2
levels, with a trend toward increased expression in imatinibna€ve samples consistent with possible involvement in drug
resistance. Our ﬁndings provide a mechanistic rationale to
evaluate existing FGFR inhibitors and multikinase inhibitors
that target FGFR3 as promising strategies to improve treatment
of patients with GIST with de novo or acquired resistance to
imatinib. Cancer Res; 75(5); 880–91. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

the RTK platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRA;
refs. 3, 4). Activation of the PI3K pathway downstream of mutant KIT/PDGFRA is essential for GIST cell growth and survival
(5). In addition, MAPK pathway signaling is activated downstream of KIT, and plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis through
the stabilization of the transcription factor ETV1 and activation
of an oncogenic transcriptional program (6). The introduction
of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has revolutionized the clinical management of GIST and exempliﬁes
the success of targeted therapy in solid tumors, where 80%
to 90% of patients with GIST with unresectable or disseminated
disease initially attain at least disease stabilization, or complete
or partial response to imatinib mesylate (7). However, nearly
50% of GIST cases treated with imatinib develop secondary resistance in the ﬁrst 2 years (8). Most frequently, secondary
resistance is due to acquisition of additional mutations in
KIT or PDGFRA that decrease the binding afﬁnity for imatinib
(9). However, another mechanism that is likely to account for
acquired resistance in a subset of GISTs is activation of pathways other than KIT and PDGFRA, thereby bypassing the
inhibitory effects of KIT/PDGFRA-targeted small molecules.
RTKs are tightly regulated in normal cells, but frequently
acquire transforming functions due to mutation(s), overexpression, and autocrine paracrine stimulation in human cancers.
Selective TKIs can block this activity and constitute a promising
approach for molecularly guided therapeutics. For example, the
FGF signaling network is deregulated in several human cancers,
including breast, bladder, prostate, endometrial, and non–small

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract
with 5,000 to 6,000 new cases in the United States each year
(1). The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) KIT is highly expressed
and carries activating mutations in most GISTs (2). The majority of GISTs with wild-type KIT have activating mutations in

FGF Signaling in Imatinib-Resistant GIST

cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 10). Receptors may be aberrantly
activated through mutations (11, 12), ampliﬁcations (13), or
fusions (14). The ligands for FGF receptors have also shown
aberrant activity in a variety of cancers. High expression of FGF3,
FGF8, and FGF10 has been reported in breast cancer (15), and
correlates with malignant behavior. In prostate cancer (16), FGF2
expressed by stromal cells promotes tumor progression (17).
Activation of the FGF signaling axis by FGF8, FGF9, and FGF10
overexpression is also associated with an aggressive clinical phenotype (18). In addition, FGF2 has recently been shown to
mediate resistance to chemotherapy, and, as laid out in this paper,
may also provide intrinsic protection of tumor cells in the presence of small-molecule kinase inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
GIST T1 cells were treated with 10,000 nmol/L imatinib for 2
months and GIST 10R grew out as a resistant colony. The cells were
expanded and sequenced for KIT (exon 11–21) and PDGFRA and
PDGFRB (exon 12, 14, and 18). No secondary mutations were
found in any of these RTKs. GIST T1, GIST 10R, and GIST 882 cells
were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 15% FBS
(Atlanta Biologicals), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and
Fungizone. GIST T1, GIST 10R, and GIST 882 cells were Sanger
sequenced to verify reported activating mutations in KIT. In
addition, comparative RNA sequencing of GIST T1 and GIST
10R cells revealed equivalent gene expression and mutational
proﬁles, conﬁrming that these cell lines were derived from the
same original clone.
siRNA and kinase inhibitors
The RAPID siRNA library has been previously described
(19–21). All siRNAs were from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Dharmacon RNAi Technologies and cumulatively target the entire
tyrosine kinase gene family as well as NRAS and KRAS (93 genes
targeted total). Each well contained a pool of four siRNAs.
Cells were aliquoted at 66 mL per well in a 96-well plate and
34 mL of siRNA/OptiMEM/siRNA mixture was added to each
well. Oligofectamine and siRNA were used at a ratio of 1:6. For
assessment of cell viability and proliferation, cells were subjected to the MTS assay after 96 hours. PD173074, AZD-6244,
and PI-103 were purchased from Selleck; imatinib and CHIR258 were purchased from LC Labs.
Immunoblotting
All immunoblotting was performed using standard protocols.
Data were analyzed with ImageJ.
GIST tissue samples
All patient specimens were obtained with informed consent of
the patients on protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR).
To prepare fresh-frozen GIST tissue samples for immunoblotting,
tissue was dissected on dry ice using a razor blade. Four shavings
per sample were sonicated three times for 3 seconds in 2 Cell
Signaling Lysis Buffer.
Real time RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen). RNA was transcribed to cDNA using Superscript III

www.aacrjournals.org

reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies), using undiluted RNA.
Subsequently, cDNA was diluted 1:4 and quantiﬁed via real-time
RT-PCR following the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay protocol
(Life Technologies). Samples were plated in triplicate, and every
assay included a water control.
IHC
Analysis of GI stromal tumor samples was performed by IHC
on parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections. Antigen retrieval was
conducted using boiling citrate buffer (10 mmol/L sodium
citrate, pH 6.0) for 30 minutes. Please see Supplementary
Materials for a complete description of staining and imaging.
Statistical analyses
For cell proliferation assays, a Student t test was carried out
for each treatment condition compared with untreated cells or
appropriate controls. The P values for the t tests are indicated by
asterisks:  , 0.01  P < 0.05;  , 0.001  P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001.
To determine the signiﬁcance of combination indices to indicate synergy, upper and lower conﬁdence limits were calculated. Data points for combinations with upper conﬁdence limits
below 1 were considered synergistic.

and Methods.

Results
siRNA-mediated knockdown identiﬁes FGFR3 dependence in
GIST cell lines
GIST T1 cells harbor a heterozygous deletion of KIT exon
11 and consequently exhibit high sensitivity to imatinib with
potent suppression of cell proliferation at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1,000 nmol/L. The GIST 10R cell line grew
out as a colony after 2 months treatment of GIST T1 cells with
10,000 nmol/L imatinib. Consequently, GIST 10R cells exhibit
no IC50 at concentrations of imatinib up to 10,000 nmol/L,
although an IC25 is still apparent at 100 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Interestingly, GIST 10R cells do exhibit reduced
phosphorylation of KIT and its downstream signaling molecules after exposure to 1,000 nmol/L imatinib (Supplementary
Fig. S1B), and no secondary mutations were found in KIT,
indicating that drug resistance in GIST 10R cells must be due
to alternative mechanisms. The fact that inhibition is equal
at equal concentrations of imatinib is likely due to the fact
that GIST 10R does not carry additional mutations in KIT that
should render this primary drug target less susceptible to
inhibition. In addition, comparative RNA sequencing between
GIST T1 and 10R revealed no point mutations or remarkable
changes in gene expression that would explain drug resistance
in these cells. To investigate possible alternative therapeutic
targets in these cells, we transfected GIST T1 and 10R cells with
a panel of siRNAs that collectively target the entire tyrosine
kinase gene family in addition to NRAS and KRAS (93 genes
total; refs. 19, 20). As expected, siRNA against KIT signiﬁcantly
reduced the relative number of proliferating GIST T1 cells
(Fig. 1A). We also observed a signiﬁcant reduction in proliferation after silencing of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor,
tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), and FGFR3. Polo-like kinase 1 plays a
critical role in mitosis in all cells and was used as a positive
control for effective siRNA-mediated silencing. Interestingly,
GIST 10R cells retained residual sensitivity to KIT silencing

(Fig. 1B); however, silencing of TYK2 and FGFR3 reduced
growth more signiﬁcantly. To conﬁrm reproducible and significant sensitivity to silencing of these genes, we independently
assessed cell proliferation after silencing of KIT, FGFR3, and
TYK2 compared with nontargeting siRNA. We conﬁrmed the
differential effect of KIT siRNA on GIST 10R and T1 cells
(Fig. 1C). KIT silencing signiﬁcantly impacted both cell lines,
but this impact was much less pronounced in GIST 10R
cells than in GIST T1 cells. We also conﬁrmed that both cell
lines were sensitive to FGFR3 silencing to a comparable degree.
For reference, FGFR3 phosphorylation and expression levels
are compared in all cell line models in Supplementary Fig.
S1C. Expression of FGFR3 after treatment of GIST 10R and T1
cells with four individual siRNA duplexes also resulted in
reductions of GIST cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S2). To
determine whether this impact on relative number of viable
cells was predominantly an effect on cell growth or an induction of apoptosis, we also stained cells with Annexin V after
silencing of KIT, FGFR3, or TYK2. Although we observed minor
increases in Annexin V staining after silencing of each gene,
these changes were markedly less than the reduction observed
in overall numbers of viable cells, indicating that reduced cell
growth is largely responsible for the observed phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Inhibition and silencing of FGFR3 and KIT reveal crosstalk
We next sought to understand the role of FGFR3 in maintenance of GIST T1/10R cell growth. First, we treated both cell
lines with 1,000 nmol/L imatinib for 2 hours and then detected
the active, phosphorylated forms of KIT and FGFR3, as well as
total protein, on an immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, in both cell lines, we observed a reduction in phosphoKIT and phospho-FGFR3 after imatinib treatment. To conﬁrm
that the reduction in phospho-FGFR3 was not due to an offtarget effect of imatinib, we silenced KIT in GIST 10R and again
assessed FGFR3 phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis
(Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation was again reduced, indicating that
FGFR3 activation in GIST cells is dependent on KIT activity.
Next, we asked whether the connection between KIT and FGFR3
was reciprocal, so that FGFR3 inhibition or silencing would
affect KIT activity. We treated GIST 10R cells with the FGFR
inhibitor PD173074 at 1,000 nmol/L for 2 hours and performed immunoblot analyses (Fig. 2C). Phospho-FGFR3 and
total FGFR3 protein levels were markedly reduced after treatment with PD173074. The reduction in total protein may be
due to degradation of the receptor after inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly, KIT is not a reported target of
PD173074, yet phospho-KIT was reduced after treatment in
both cell lines. To rule out direct inhibition of KIT as the source
for reduced phosphorylation, we silenced FGFR3 using siRNA
in GIST 10R cells and assessed KIT phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2D). Again, phospho-KIT was reduced
after FGFR3 silencing, suggesting that reciprocal crosstalk

exists between KIT and FGFR3 in GIST cells. In addition, we
stimulated KIT and FGFR3 by the addition of ligand for each
receptor (SCF and FGF2, respectively) and observed increased
phosphorylation for both KIT and FGFR3 in GIST 10R and, to
a lesser degree, in GIST T1 (Fig. 2E and F). Although FGF1 is
the prototypic ligand of FGFR3, FGF2 also binds and activates
FGFR3 (22). We observed a similar increase in phosphorylation of FGFR3 and KIT in response to FGF1 (Supplementary
Fig. S4A); however, FGF2 elicited a more dramatic protective
effect after imatinib treatment (Fig. 3A–C) compared with FGF1
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). We thus chose to conduct subsequent experiments using FGF2.
Coimmunoprecipitation in HEK 293 cells indicates direct
crosstalk between KIT and FGFR3
Reciprocal crosstalk between two RTKs may result from
indirect interaction (mediated by a common downstream

www.aacrjournals.org

kinase), or direct interaction through the formation of heterodimers or other receptor clustering. To test the hypothesis that
the crosstalk between KIT and FGFR3 is direct, we cotransfected
HEK 293 cells with plasmids containing KIT and FGFR3 wildtype cDNA. We performed immunoprecipitation with a KITspeciﬁc antibody, followed by immunoblotting for FGFR3
(Fig. 2G). We observed coimmunoprecipitation of KIT and
FGFR3, suggesting a direct interaction between these RTKs.
The reverse coimmunoprecipitation was not successful, likely
because there is no antibody suitable for immunoprecipitation
of FGFR3 available to us.
Signaling through FGFR3 desensitizes GIST cells to imatinib
treatment
We reasoned that presence of ligand, in particular FGF2, in
the cell culture media might dampen the response of GIST
T1 cells to imatinib. Consequently, we treated GIST T1 cells

FGF Signaling in Imatinib-Resistant GIST

addition of FGF2 increased cell proliferation in the presence of
imatinib dramatically, with no IC50 even at concentrations as
high as 10,000 nmol/L. Of note, the combination of FGF2 and
SCF conferred a further increase in viability at low concentrations of imatinib. Similar results were observed using a different,
KIT-sensitive GIST-derived cell line, GIST 882 (Fig. 3B). We also
cultured GIST T1 cells with 1,000 nmol/L imatinib in the
presence or absence of 10 ng/mL SCF or FGF2 (Fig. 3C). Viable
cells were counted every 2 to 3 days for 19 days. As expected,
culture with SCF did not confer any growth advantage over cells
cultured with imatinib and a vehicle control. The addition of
FGF2, however, increased the number of viable cells starting at
day 4. Importantly, cells not only persisted in the culture, but,
after a lag phase, continued to divide and exceeded the number
initially plated on day 0. We hypothesized that the desensitization of GIST cells to imatinib is indeed mediated through the
interaction between KIT and FGFR3, and not the result of an
alternative survival pathway replacing KIT signaling. To this end,
we measured GIST T1 cell growth after KIT silencing in the
presence or absence of FGF2 with the hypothesis that presence
of KIT protein would be required for FGF2 rescue (Fig. 3D). As
predicted, rescue of cell growth by FGF2 was ineffective after KIT
knockdown, indicating that FGF2 rescue requires presence of
both KIT and FGFR3. We also showed that inhibition of FGFR3
by PD173074, which inhibits GIST T1 cell proliferation with an
IC50 of 300 nmol/L, can be partially reversed by the addition of
SCF (Supplementary Fig. S5) and that SCF rescue is ineffective
after silencing of FGFR3 (Fig. 3D). To test whether desensitization to imatinib is, indeed, mediated by FGFR3, we performed
siRNA knockdown of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 in GIST T1,
and subsequently treated with imatinib and FGF2 (Fig. 3E).
Knockdown of FGF receptors was conﬁrmed via real-time
RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S6). FGF2 rescue of imatinib
sensitivity remained effective after FGFR1 and FGFR2 silencing;
however, FGFR3 silencing ablated the response to FGF2, implicating FGFR3 but not FGFR1 or FGFR2 in FGF2-mediated
drug resistance. We next treated GIST T1 cells with 0, 50, or
500 nmol/L imatinib and stimulated cells with SCF or FGF2. At
baseline, KIT phosphorylation was responsive to both SCF and
FGF2 stimulation. The response to SCF was conserved in the
context of 50 nmol/L imatinib treatment, but was markedly
decreased after treatment with 500 nmol/L imatinib. In contrast,
FGF2 still restored KIT phosphorylation at 500 nmol/L (Fig. 3F).
To ensure that this observation was not speciﬁc to the cell line
GIST T1, we repeated this experiment in the cell line GIST 882
(Fig. 3G). Again, we observed that KIT phosphorylation in GIST
882 was completely ablated at 500 nmol/L imatinib without
FGF2 stimulation, but could be partially restored by the addition of FGF2. We subsequently sought to determine the effects
of FGF2 stimulation on downstream signaling in the setting of
imatinib treatment (Fig. 3H). Analysis of AKT and MAPK
pathway activation revealed that both pathways are inhibited
after imatinib treatment. However, although AKT phosphorylation remained inhibited after the addition of FGF2, MEK1/2
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was restored.
Combined inhibition of KIT and FGFR3 is highly synergistic in
imatinib-resistant GIST cells
We hypothesized that combination treatment using imatinib and the selective FGFR inhibitor PD173074 may restore
imatinib sensitivity in resistant GIST cells. Accordingly, we

www.aacrjournals.org

performed dose–response curves in the imatinib-resistant GIST
10R cells using imatinib and PD173074 alone as well as a
constant, equimolar ratio combination of the two drugs
(Fig. 4A). We then determined the combination index (CI) for
each dose point using the Chou–Talalay method to quantify
synergy. Figure 4B shows CI values plotted against the log of
drug dose. Over the entire dosing curve, the CI values ranged
from 0.0005 to 0.004, indicating an extremely high degree of
synergy between the two drugs.
We next wanted to determine whether signaling pathways
activated downstream of FGFR3 might also exhibit synergy
with KIT inhibition. To this end, we treated GIST 10R cells
with combinations of imatinib and PLX-4720, a B-Raf inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S7), AZD-6244, a MAPK inhibitor
(Fig. 4C), and PI103, a PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 4D). Combination
of imatinib with inhibitors of the RAF/MAPK pathway exhibited signiﬁcant synergy at all concentrations tested. In contrast,
combination of imatinib with inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT
pathway did not result in synergy with imatinib. Combined
treatment with imatinib and AZD-6244, in particular, led to a
decrease in cell growth similar to that observed after imatinib
and PD173074 treatment, suggesting that the MAPK pathway
is a key mediator of imatinib resistance in GIST 10R cells.
The MAPK signaling pathway is activated in GIST 10R cells in
response to imatinib
We performed immunoblot analysis to assess phosphorylation of AKT, c-Raf, MEK, and ERK in GIST 10R and T1 cells
after 2-hour treatment with 1,000 nmol/L imatinib (Fig. 5A). In
both cell lines, AKT phosphorylation was equivalently reduced
after treatment. However, we observed divergent effects on
MAPK pathway activation. Phosphorylation of c-Raf was
reduced less markedly in GIST 10R compared with GIST T1
cells. Even more strikingly, phosphorylation of MEK and ERK
was abolished in GIST T1 after imatinib treatment, but
increased in GIST 10R. To determine whether this feedback
mechanism could be solely regulated at the receptor level, or
whether it might also be regulated after direct inactivation of
the downstream PI3K signaling, we treated GIST 10R cells with
the PI3K inhibitor PI103 and asked whether the same increased
phosphorylation of MAPK signaling resulted (Fig. 5B). No
increase in c-Raf, MEK, or ERK phosphorylation was observed
after inhibition of PI3K. To assess whether FGF receptors are
involved in mediating this MAPK feedback mechanism, we
inhibited KIT and FGFRs, either by the dual inhibitor CHIR258 (dovitinib; Fig. 5C), or by a combination of imatinib and
PD173074 (Fig. 5D). We found that MAPK activation was
abrogated in both cases, providing a mechanistic basis for the
synergy observed in Fig. 4.
FGF2 is overexpressed in GIST 10R cells and is increased in
tumor tissue after imatinib treatment
Because our data suggest that FGF2 can promote imatinib
resistance in GIST cells, we wanted to determine whether FGF2
levels are higher in GIST 10R than GIST T1 cells and whether
this may underlie the resistance of GIST 10R cells to imatinib. It
is well recognized that FGF2 associates with heparan sulfate in
the extracellular matrix. We were thus unable to detect it in
supernatant but found it present in cell lysate. Evaluation of
FGF2 protein levels did reveal increased levels of FGF2 in GIST
10R cells compared with GIST T1 (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, we

investigated whether silencing of FGF2 in GIST 10R cells
changes cell growth when compared with treatment with nontargeting siRNA. Indeed, we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in
cell growth after GIST 10R cells were treated with FGF2 siRNA
(insert in Fig. 6B). We next asked whether siRNA-mediated
knockdown of FGF2 would resensitize these cells to imatinib.
Silencing of FGF2 dramatically shifted the IC50 for imatinib in
GIST 10R cells (Fig. 6B), indicating that FGF2 contributes to
imatinib resistance in GIST 10R and that the inhibition of FGF
signaling restores the response to imatinib in a resistant GIST
cell line. Knockdown of FGF2 expression was conﬁrmed via
real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S8). We sought to examine whether increased levels of FGF2 correlated with KIT activation in GIST patient samples. We obtained a panel of six
frozen tissue specimens from GI stromal tumors with conﬁrmed activating mutations in KIT exon 11. Five of the tumors
were treatment na€ve at the time of biopsy, while one patient
had received 4 to 5 weeks of imatinib before the tumor being
removed. The treatment was discontinued 3 to 4 days before
surgery. We performed immunoblot analyses for activated KIT
and FGFR, as well as FGF2 levels in these samples (Fig. 6C) and
observed increased FGF2 in specimen TB-7248, which had
been exposed to imatinib. The pan-phospho-FGFR antibody
yielded immunoblot analyses with lower background and was
thus chosen here for use on tumor lysates. Concurrent with
high FGF2 levels, we observed a high degree of phosphorylated
KIT and FGFR. This observation is consistent with our model
of FGF2-mediated reactivation of KIT. We sought to validate
these ﬁndings in a larger number of GIST samples by performing IHC staining for FGF2 on ten sections of formalin-ﬁxed

quantiﬁcation process is provided in Supplementary Fig. S9.
Samples not previously exposed to treatment were segregated
by mitotic rate and tumor size according to the Fletcher risk
table into low-risk and intermediate/high-risk categories.
Figure 6E–G provides examples of IHC staining in treatment
na€ve, low-risk disease, as well as two cases of imatinib exposed
tumor samples. Overall, low risk was associated with low FGF2
staining, whereas intermediate/high-risk and treatment exposure or resistance were associated with elevated levels, warranting further study of FGF2 levels in even larger cohorts of
primary GIST patient specimens in the future.

Discussion
Our study describes for the ﬁrst time a functional cooperation between FGFR3 and KIT in human GIST and analyzes the
molecular mechanisms that underlie this cooperation. The
ﬁndings provide insight into the protective potential of FGF
signaling in GIST and into the signal transduction pathways
that mediate resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of KIT in
these tumors. Moreover, this represents a new mechanism of
resistance in this setting that can account for GIST patients
progressing on imatinib in the absence of a secondary resistance mutation in KIT.
In addition to the paracrine action of cancer cell-secreted
FGF2 on endothelial cells, FGF2 can provide autocrine
prosurvival and mitogenic signals, and confer resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs. FGF2 (over)expression has been
observed after chemoradiation and is correlated with

FGF Signaling in Imatinib-Resistant GIST

respectively (28, 29). FGF2 overexpression is not only associated with resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, but also
correlates with an increased risk of recurrence and reduced
overall survival. The array of tumor types and treatments to
which FGF2 is connected suggests a global protective role for
this ligand, which is in line with FGF2's role in normal tissues
during injury and inﬂammation.
Here, we present one of the ﬁrst accounts of FGF2-mediating
resistance to targeted therapy. Recently, activation of FGFR3 and
the downstream MEK/ERK pathway was also implicated in resistance to a targeted agent, the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib, in
melanoma (25). The protective effect of FGF2 in this setting is
mediated by the MAPK pathway and downstream activation of
ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (30, 31). Similarly, an autocrine
signaling loop was identiﬁed in NSCLC, where FGFRs and their
ligands were coexpressed and provided an alternative pathway to
EGFR signaling in cells treated with geﬁtinib (32). This correlates
well with our ﬁnding that MAPK pathway members are preferentially activated after FGF2 stimulation in the presence of imatinib in GIST T1 cells. Similarly, this pathway remained active in
GIST 10R cells during imatinib treatment, and these cells could be
resensitized by combined imatinib and MAPK inhibitor treatment. The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is already recognized
as an important driver of cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis in GIST, as evidenced by an ongoing phase II multicenter
trial of the Raf inhibitor sorafenib in imatinib- and sunitinibresistant GIST. Selective inhibition of this pathway also inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in
patient-derived GIST xenograft lines (33). Taken together with
our observations, this underscores the potential of the Raf/MEK/
ERK signaling pathway as potential future targets of molecular
therapy in GIST.
We propose that, in addition to preferential activation of
the MAPK pathway, FGFR3 activation partially restores KIT
activity. In the setting of overexpression of both receptors, we
demonstrated an interaction between the two receptors.
Although these data are supportive of a direct interaction
between KIT and FGFR3, this is only one mechanism potentially underlying the crosstalk observed in GIST cells, and
other possibilities such as the involvement of downstream
mediators should not be discarded. Receptor crosstalk and
heterodimerization to circumvent targeted therapy have been
explored extensively in the setting of EGFR inhibition. EGFR
can interact with other RTKs such as MET, ERBB2, and IGF1R[38]. These mechanisms were identiﬁed at the clinical and
preclinical level in NSCLC and breast cancer. Overexpression
and activation of EGFR can promote transphosphorylation of
MET in lung and epidermal carcinoma cell lines. Activation of

MET occurs in an EGFR-ligand dependent manner in the
setting of EGFR overexpression, or independently of ligand
in glioblastomas expressing a constitutively active EGFR variant. Xenograft models of glioblastoma require targeting of
both EGFR and MET to achieve growth inhibition (34). The
crosstalk between KIT and FGFR3 we present in this paper
involves two hitherto unconnected signaling pathways, which
are highly relevant to human cancers. Our ﬁndings are consistent with the biology reported for crosstalk in other systems. Although no previous reports exist of transactivation
between KIT and FGFR3, there is evidence that FGFRs can
crosstalk with other RTKs. For example, the cytoplasmic
domains of FGF receptors and EphA4 can interact and transphosphorylate each other (35).
In light of the propensity of FGF2 to desensitize GIST
cells to the short- and long-term effects of imatinib, we suggest that FGF2 expression in treated tumors provides the
basis for the development of resistance. Future studies should
determine the mechanism of FGF2 upregulation and examine the dynamics of FGF2 expression with imatinib treatment. This would provide valuable information to identify
patient populations who may be at risk of FGF-mediated
resistance, either by constitutive overexpression or by sustained upregulation in response to therapy. Our observations
are an added incentive to pursue targeted treatment that
combines inhibition of KIT with antagonism of protective
signaling from autocrine loops or the tumor stroma. This
strategy could be especially powerful with screening to identify patients at risk for microenvironment-induced resistance.
In summary, we show for the ﬁrst time that the FGFR3 pathway
crosstalks with KIT, and that FGF2 mediates survival and outgrowth of GIST cells during imatinib treatment. We further
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of FGF2-mediated drug
rescue. Our data suggest that incorporation of FGFR3 inhibitors
to combination therapeutic regimens may be beneﬁcial in overcoming clinical resistance to targeted therapies for some patients
with GIST.
