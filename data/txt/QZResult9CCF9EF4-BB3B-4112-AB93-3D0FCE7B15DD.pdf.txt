ABSTRACT
Prostate Cancer (PCa) is an important age-related disease being the most
common cancer malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in
men in Western countries. Initially, PCa progression is androgen receptor (AR)- and
androgen-dependent. Eventually advanced PCa reaches the stage of CastrationResistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), but remains dependent on AR, which indicates
the importance of AR activity also for CRPC. Here, we discuss various pathways that
influence the AR activity in CRPC, which indicates an adaptation of the AR signaling in
PCa to overcome the treatment of PCa. The adaptation pathways include interferences
of the normal regulation of the AR protein level, the expression of AR variants, the
crosstalk of the AR with cytokine tyrosine kinases, the Src-Akt-, the MAPK-signaling
pathways and AR corepressors. Furthermore, we summarize the current treatment
options with regard to the underlying molecular basis of the common adaptation
processes of AR signaling that may arise after the treatment with AR antagonists,
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as well as for CRPC, and point towards novel
therapeutic strategies. The understanding of individualized adaptation processes in
PCa will lead to individualized treatment options in the future.

INTRODUCTION

prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, age
and co-morbidity of the patient, treatment of localized
PCa includes active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or
radiotherapy [2, 3].
Local recurrent PCa after failure of primary surgery/
radiotherapy and hormone-naive metastatic disease are
treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [4].
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists
or LHRH antagonists, eventually combined with antiandrogens as bicalutamide, are used to achieve hormonal
depletion [4]. Initially, the reduction of circulating
androgens decreases androgen receptor (AR)-mediated

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer
type among men in Western countries and the second
leading cause of cancer-related death in males [1]. In
more than 80% of cases, PCa is diagnosed at the local
stage and is often a low-risk disease with indolent clinical
course and favorable survival [2]. The management of
localized PCa is controversial as the identification of
the subset of patients with aggressive, high-risk disease
remains challenging. Considering histopathological
features (i.e. Gleason grade, extent of the tumor), serum

proliferation and survival of tumor cells. Therefore, ADT
leads to remission of the tumor lasting for up to a few
years and results in a decline of serum PSA [5]. However,
after initial response to ADT, tumor cells ultimately
become castration-resistant resulting in progression of the
disease despite anorchid serum androgen levels [6]. Of all
patients diagnosed of PCa, 10-20% develop castrationresistant disease, mostly within a few months to a few
years after initiation of ADT [7].
The underlying molecular basis how PCa cells
escape from the growth control by exogenous androgens
is still poorly understood. Adaptive mechanisms of PCa
cells include molecular alterations in response to androgen
ablation leading to re-activation of the AR despite low
circulating androgens after initial response to ADT [8].
Over the past years, several studies give evidence for
selection advantages resulting in clonal outgrowth of
initial androgen-independent cells [9]. This theory of
castration-resistance is based on the observation that
aggressive castration-resistant cells show distinct gene
expression patterns and molecular properties, which are
not present in parental PCa cells [10].
Mechanisms
mediating
castration-resistance
comprise the re-activation of AR signaling despite low
levels of circulating androgens on the one hand, as well
as the activation of alternative AR-independent pathways
on the other hand.
Maintained AR activity under androgen deprivation
is based on genetic and functional aberrations affecting
components of the AR signaling axis which have been
observed in CRPC cells [11]. Genetic alterations such
as AR gene amplification resulting in increased AR
expression occur in about one third of CRPC tumors
[11, 12], while AR mutation or alternative splice variants
allowing the tumor to respond to very low androgen
levels can be observed in a smaller subset of CRPC cases
[11, 13]. Persistent transcriptional AR activity can also
be mediated through alternative ligands as progesterone
or by ligand-independent transcriptional activity [14].
Furthermore, the intratumoral conversion of androgen
precursors as well as the de novo steroidogenesis provides
persistent intraprostatic androgen concentrations sufficient
to activate the AR despite low serum testosterone [15].
Additionally, alternative AR activation eventuates from
alterations of coactivators and corepressors of the AR
signaling as well as cross-activation through bypass
pathways [16, 17]. Genetic alterations frequently found
in CRPC contributing to dysregulated survival signaling
involve c-myc amplification, PTEN loss, as well as
alterations of genes implicated in the growth factor
receptor signaling such as PI3K, Src kinase, Ras/MAPK
[6, 8].
Admittedly, no treatment options with curative
intent are available for castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) to date [4]. Current palliative therapeutic
strategies for CRPC comprise docetaxel as conventional
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapy, the immunostimulant sipuleucel-T and the
inhibitor of androgen synthesis abiraterone acetate [4].
Cabazitaxel as chemotherapeutic agent, the AR antagonist
enzalutamide and the radiopharmaceutical radium-223 are
available as second line therapy after docetaxel treatment
[4]. Additional options for patients with metastatic CRPC
include the bone-targeting agents zoledronic acid and the
receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand inhibitor
denosumab [4]. Various pre-clinical approaches identified
promising strategies to prevent rapid progression to
castration-resistance [18]. Different classes of agents
targeting components involved in survival pathways
[19], DNA damage repair [20], angiogenesis [21], tumor
microenvironment [22] or the immune system [4, 18]
have reached phase III in clinical trials. Future studies
will reveal whether these agents have the potential to
significantly increase survival of patients with CRPC.
This review will highlight the current knowledge
about adaptive mechanisms of the AR signaling as well as
the significance of its interaction partners contributing to
the development of castration-resistance.

ADAPTIVE RESPONSES IN AR SIGNALING
THROUGH AR MUTANTS AND AR
VARIANTS
An adaptive response in AR signaling may also
occur at the level of mutations and splice variants of
the AR that occur under the selective pressure of ADT.
Structurally, the AR is organized in 4 different domains:
the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), a central
DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region (HR)
which connects the DBD to the carboxy-terminal ligand
binding domain (LBD) (Figure 1A). Upon androgen
binding, the AR dissociates from heat shock proteins
(HSP) and translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes
with another AR molecule. Subsequently, this AR dimer
binds to chromatin and androgen response elements in the
promoter regions of androgen-dependent genes, thereby
activating/inhibiting their transcription. The implication
of HSP in adaptation of AR signaling in PCa has recently
been reviewed and suggests an increased expression of
HSP70 and HSP27 that correlates with PCa aggressiveness
and CRPC [23].
AR mutations are very rare in early stages of PCa.
However, approximately 10-30% of CRPC patients
carry AR mutations, especially when treated with ADT,
indicating an adaptation to ADT by changing AR function
[24]. In CRPC almost 50% of AR mutations cluster to
4 discrete regions of the AR LBD (Figure 1A). Somatic
mutations in the AR LBD usually result in decreased
receptor specificity, thereby broadening the number
of steroids that can bind and activate the receptor. In
addition, many of these mutated AR can be activated by
anti-androgens. A prototype for this promiscuous gain
of function mutants is AR-T877A. Initially identified in
35543

Oncotarget

LNCaP cells, T877A (now T878A, according to the AR
Mutations Database at http://androgendb.mcgill.ca, [25]
was repeatedly found in flutamide-treated CRPC patients
[26-28]. Functional studies demonstrated that T877A
is strongly activated by the anti-androgens flutamide/
hydroxyflutamide and by progesterone. Interestingly, the
CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone was shown to increase
intracellular progesterone levels, thereby allowing
progesterone-inducible T877A to circumvent abirateronemediated inhibition of AR signaling in CRPC cells [29].
While T877A diminishes the efficacy of abiraterone,
another interesting mutation, F876L, is able to convert
AR antagonists like enzalutamide and ARN-509 to AR
agonists [30, 31]. Most importantly, F876L still remained
sensitive to the effects of bicalutamide [30].
Early functional in vitro studies showed a high
constitutive transcriptional activity of AR constructs in
which the LBD has been artificially deleted [32]. Due
to the deletion of the functional LBD situated in the AR

C-terminus, these AR variants are generally referred to as
AR∆LBD. Blocking of the androgen/AR signaling axis
was shown to induce a rapid increase of AR∆LBD in PCa
cells [33]. So far, 17 AR∆LBD variants have been isolated
from castration-resistant tumor cell lines/xenografts
or clinical tumor specimens. Although AR∆LBD are
predominantly products of alternative splicing (AR-V),
they can also be products of nonsense mutations (ARQ640X) or proteolytic cleavage (tr-AR) [34] (Figure 1B).
Although all AR∆LBD lack a functional LBD, they can
be subdivided into 2 structurally different subgroups,
depending on the presence or absence of a HR (Figure
1B). Besides its function as a flexible linker between the
DBD and the LBD, the HR carries a nuclear localization
signal and a microtubule binding domain.
As AR∆LBD do not express a functional LBD,
they are insensitive to all currently available hormonal
therapies targeting directly (anti-androgens) or indirectly
(inhibitors of androgen synthesis) the LBD [35, 36]. These

in vitro observations could explain at least in part the
well described cross-resistance between abiraterone and
enzalutamide in the clinical setting [37, 38]. In addition,
there is experimental evidence that different AR∆LBD
variants are able to determine the sensitivity in PCa cells
towards first generation taxanes like docetaxel or paclitaxel
[39]. Both compounds were shown to impair nuclear
localization of the AR via modulation of the microtubule
AR network [39, 40]. As suggested by Thadani-Mulero,
only AR forms expressing a microtubule binding domain
situated in the HR of the receptor (e.g. wild type AR,
ARv567es) are susceptible to taxane-mediated microtubule
stabilization that is abrogating nuclear translocation and
transcriptional activity of these receptors [40]. In contrast,
HR-negative AR∆LBD like AR-V7 that do not associate
with the microtubule machinery accumulate in the
nucleus via a yet unknown mechanism thereby activating
the transcriptional machinery [40]. However, the ability
of taxanes to modulate AR/AR∆LBD-signaling in the
clinical setting has been discussed with some controversy
[41, 42]. Enzalutamide-resistant tumors often exhibit a
cross-resistance with docetaxel. By contrast, cabazitaxel,
a second generation taxane, remains highly effective
in enzalutamide-resistant tumors, indicating that the
inhibitory effects of docetaxel on AR/AR∆LBD-signaling
represent only a minor part of its antitumor activity [41].
Moreover, the concentrations reported to affect AR and
AR∆LBD translocation in vitro [40] are far beyond the
effective taxane concentrations achieved in the clinical
setting [41, 42]. As a result, a more thorough analysis of
the mechanisms involved in regulation of AR/AR∆LBDsignaling by taxanes is needed.
The occurrence and detection of AR point
mutations and AR∆LBD are of prognostic and therapeutic
significance. In order to guide initial treatment selection
or sequential therapies, there is an urgent need for new
markers. Serum biomarker studies may be difficult to
compare because of different procedures in various
laboratories. Current research is focusing on the noninvasive retrieval of tumor DNA from blood/serum
samples, i.e. circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or DNA
from circulating tumor cells (CTC) to analyze aberrant AR
variants. AR mutants like F876L or T877A have already
been successfully isolated from blood and CTC samples
isolated from patients suffering from advanced CRPC
[31, 43, 44]. Recently, Antonarakis et al. were able to
demonstrate that patients with AR-V7 expression in CTCs
had statistically shorter time to PSA and radiographic
progression and shorter overall survival [45]. These
findings are supported by a recent study from our group,
which analyzed both AR-V7 and AR point mutations in
CTCs of patients suffering from advanced PCa [44].
The discovery of constitutively active AR∆LBD
that do not express a LBD has led to the development of
promising novel experimental approaches targeting ARsignaling in a LBD-independent manner [46-51]. Recent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

efforts to develop drugs targeting the TAD situated in the
N-terminus of the AR have led to the discovery of the
small molecule inhibitor EPI-001, a bisphenol A-derivative
that binds covalently and inhibits the AR amino-terminal
TAD [46]. Low toxicity combined with the ability to block
transactivation of both AR and AR∆LBDs makes EPI-001
the most promising third generation compound for the
treatment of CRPC.
The analysis of AR-point mutations and/or ARsplice variants has led to the discovery of new prognostic
and therapeutic targets in CRPC. In summary, the
combination of new prognostic parameters able to
guide treatment selection along with novel therapeutic
approaches will establish a new era of personalized,
targeted therapies.

ADAPTIVE RESPONSES IN AR SIGNALING
BY TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION OF
THE AR
The upregulation of AR protein is a hallmark of
CRPC and seems to represent an adaptive response to
ADT [52]. Presumably, the increased AR protein level
expedites the reactivation of the AR signaling. On the
one hand, the AR gene amplification is observed in about
one third of these cases [53] as one mechanism while on
the other hand post-translational regulation represents
another underlying molecular mechanism with increasing
importance for enhancing AR signaling. Here the factors
and pathways at the level of translational regulation of the
AR are described in the context of PCa. Interestingly, the
AR transcript has a long 3’untranslated region (3’UTR),
which is predestinated for post-translational regulation via
RNA binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability or
translation efficiency. RNA binding proteins Hu antigen R
and polyC-binding proteins (PCBPs) 1 and 2 were found
to bind to a UC rich motif in the 3’UTR of AR mRNA and
regulate its translation [54, 55]. PCBP1 was identified as a
blocker of AR translation in dedifferentiating endometrial
cells and this role was confirmed in LNCaP PCa cells [56].
An UC-rich 3’UTR motif is also the target site of
another AR post-transcriptional inhibitor, ErbB3 binding
protein (EBP1) that in addition also binds to a RNA
stem-loop formed by the CAG repeats encoding the polyglutamine stretch in the AR N-terminus [57]. Whereas
EBP1 interaction with the UC region in the 3’UTR
promotes mRNA decay, its binding to the CAG stemloop seems to attenuate translation of AR mRNA. This
post-transcriptional inhibition of AR protein synthesis of
EBP1 is an additional function to its described activity as
a repressor protein of AR transcriptional activity [58, 59].
In line with its interference with the AR axis, EBP1 was
found downregulated in advanced stages of PCa [60] and
inhibiting PCa cell growth when overexpressed [58].
The nucleic acid binding protein called
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) is
35545

Oncotarget

an additional inhibitor of AR mRNA translation and an
inhibitor of PCa cell proliferation via binding to several
sites in the AR mRNA including sites in both untranslated
terminal regions and in the coding region [61]. Further
support for its inhibitory role in PCa comes from its
inverse correlation with AR protein in primary prostate
tumors and its altered pattern of expression in tumor
metastases.
A mechanism for enhancement of AR translation
was identified recently and is based on a reciprocal link
between the AR and the ribonucleoprotein transcriptional
enhancer complex assembled by midline 1 (MID1), a
protein that is mutated in the developmental syndrome
Opitz G/BBB [62, 63]. Overexpression of MID1 in PCa
cells results in an upregulation of AR protein and in
line with this an increase of AR transcriptional activity
whereas MID1 knockdown decreases AR protein levels
[64]. Within the AR N-terminus there is a poly-glutamine
and a poly-glycine repeat both encoded by purinerich trinucleotid repeats, a CAG and a GGY repeat,

respectively. Notably, both trinucleotide repeats interact
with the MID1 protein complex. The MID1 protein
complex binds the AR mRNA via both trinucleotide
repeats and enhances AR translation [64]. In addition to
MID1, this transcriptional regulator complex contains
the regulatory and the catalytic subunits of protein
phosphatase 2A (alpha-4 and PP2Ac) [65] and MID1 also
has an ubiquitin ligase activity that targets PP2Ac in the
complex to proteasomal degradation thus regulating PP2A
activity [66]. As PP2A is a major antagonist of protein
kinases involved in growth factor signaling cascades, its
degradation further stimulates tumor cells [67].
AR regulation by MID1 occurs via enhancement
of AR translation. However, the interaction of the MID1
complex and the AR axis is not uni- but bi-directional.
Whereas MID1 regulates AR protein through translation
control, AR is a negative regulator of MID1 via several
AR binding sites in the MID1 gene. This mutual
interaction forms a classical regulatory feedback loop that
was suggested as a fine-tuning mechanism for homeostasis

Figure 2: Schematic view of the AR activation pathway that undergoes adaptation during progression towards CRPC
and therapy resistance. Summarized targets for future therapeutic interventions of CRPC within the AR signaling pathway and AR

adaptive responses. The level of increased AR protein in CRPC is in part regulated at mRNA level. In addition to its cognate hormone,
the AR is activated by tyrosine kinase and MAPK signaling, leading to dissociation of heat shock proteins (HSP). HSPs might thus
present targets of intervention into AR signaling [23]. Further steps of AR signaling are the translocation to the nucleus, DNA binding and
regulation of AR target gene expression. Besides the wild-type (wt) AR, isoforms and mutants of AR exist for which the inhibition is also
an important future goal for treatment of CRPC. Detection of activated individualized pathways that activate the AR may allow using highly
specific inhibitors in combination therapies. Inhibitors of specific AR activation signaling are highlighted in red color.

of AR protein level. ADT of PCa would disrupt this
mechanism and result in MID1 and subsequently
AR protein upregulation. In line with this, MID1 is
significantly overexpressed in PCa in a stage-dependent
manner [64].
Noteworthy, the assembly of the MID1-alpha4/
PP2Ac protein complex is disrupted by the antidiabetic
drug metformin as first reported by Kickstein et al. [68].
Besides decreasing blood glucose levels metformin
inhibits many types of cancer and non-malignant cells,
among them also PCa cells [69, 70]. In addition it was
suggested as a tumor preventive drug, although these
data are still inconclusive [71-74]. Testing its effect
on the MID1-AR feedback loop revealed disruption of
AR mRNA association with the protein complex and
subsequent downregulation of AR protein in PCa cells
treated with metformin [75]. The inhibitory effect of
metformin was mimicked by disruption of the MID1alpha4/PP2As protein complex by siRNA knockdown of
MID1 or alpha4 whereas activation of another target of
metformin, AMP kinase was not required.
Thus, the inhibition of AR protein levels by
metformin suggests its use in the treatment of hormonenaïve PCa and CRPC. In support of this, a metformin
treatment study in 44 men with progressive metastatic
CRPC who received metformin until disease progression
resulted in disease stabilization and prolongation of PSA
doubling time [76]. Retrospective analysis revealed that
the risk of progression to CRPC in patients treated for
localized disease with external-beam radiation therapy
was reduced in metformin users compared to patients
treated with other anti-diabetic drugs [77]. In contrast
another recent study did not confirm a reduced risk for
adverse outcome in PCa patients by metformin alone [78],
which calls for further thorough evaluation of a potential
benefit of metformin in the treatment of PCa. Perhaps, the
combination of metformin and AR antagonists, such as
enzalutamide, that is currently under clinical investigation
(NCT02339168), may provide a benefit for patients.
Last but not least, a new class of post-transcriptional
regulators also acting on AR, are micro-RNAs (miRNAs)
that control gene expression by inhibition of protein
translation or induction of mRNA cleavage. These small
RNAs of about 22 bases in length are generated by
processing of mostly untranslated RNA and each miRNA
can regulate a variety of target mRNAs [79, 80]. Several
miRNAs have been reported to target various sites in AR
mRNA and inhibit androgen receptor-positive PCa cell
lines, e.g. miR488*, miR125, miR205, mir185, miR1,
miR31 [81-86]. A systematic combined experimental
and in silico screen for miRNAs targeting the long
3’UTR of the AR performed in PCa cell lines identified
75 miRNAs that regulate AR protein level [87]. Fifteen
miRNAs downregulating AR were confirmed to decrease
androgen-induced proliferation of PCa cells. This number
underscores the complexity of post-transcriptional
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulation by miRNAs and offer new strategies for
therapeutic intervention.
In conclusion, the diverse mechanisms of AR
modulation at the level of mRNA and translation into
protein can result in adaptation of AR signaling. The
variety of proteins and miRNAs involved define a complex
regulatory network for fine-tuning of AR protein level in
PCa that might be used as drug targets and calls for efforts
to develop methods to interfere with post-transcriptional
AR regulation for improving inhibition of the AR axis in
PCa therapy.

ADAPTIVE RESPONSES IN AR SIGNALING
THROUGH GROWTH FACTORS AND
TYROSINE KINASES
There are several levels of interaction between
growth factor receptors and AR in PCa. Transcription
activation function of the AR could be enhanced by
growth factors and growth factor-related receptors in a
synergistic and ligand-independent manner [88, 89].
Mechanistically, growth factors and related
receptors lead to activation of MAPK that phosphorylate
specific amino acids in the N-terminal region of the AR
[90]. In consequence, HER-2, which activates kinases of
the MAPK group, leads to AR-dependent progression of
PCa, as evidenced in the LAPC-4 model [91]. The effect
of HER-2 on AR could be explained by modulation of
receptor DNA binding and AR stability [92]. Activation
of the AR by HER-2 and HER-3 was reported also in a
PCa recurrent cell line CWR-R1 [93]. Induction of HER2 occurs in vitro in conditions of androgen depletion
and pointing to possible adaptive and compensatory
effects of endocrine therapy [94]. Consistently with these
observations, HER-2 expression is increased during
cancerogenesis of PCa and leads to elevation of expression
of the AR downstream gene PSA [95, 96]. In addition,
compensatory upregulation of the Etx/BMX tyrosine
kinase was observed in CRPC cells [97].
MAPK are implicated in activation of the AR
by interleukin-6, a cytokine whose expression is
elevated in human PCa [98]. It was also demonstrated
that interleukin-6 activation of the AR occurs through
activation of MAPK and phosphorylation of N-terminal
amino acids [99]. Notably, the tyrosine kinase Src and
FAK are implicated in regulation of growth and migration
of PCa cells by interleukin-6 [100]. Interleukin-6 is a
positive growth factor being responsible for inhibition
of apoptosis and angiogenesis in several human cancers,
including PCa. Similarly, tyrosine kinase Pim1 and Etk
are required for AR activation by interleukin-6 [101]. AR
coactivators p300 and SRC-1 are particularly important
for AR activation by IL-6 [102, 103]. Both coactivators
are highly expressed in prostate cancer and are identified
as targets for therapy [104-106]. After IL-6 binding to the
receptor, signal transducer and activator of transcription

(STAT)3 factor is translocated to the nucleus and
phosphorylated. Although in LNCaP cells phosphorylation
of STAT3 may be associated with either growth inhibition
or stimulation, there is evidence obtained with other
models according to which STAT3 is a valid target for
therapy [107]. AR activation by IL-6 is potentiated by
STAT3 and MAPK pathways [108] as evidenced by
association of STAT3 with the AR, which occurs in an IL6-dependent manner [109].
Taken together, the results of several studies
mentioned above have indicated that tyrosine kinases are
particularly important in AR activation in conditions in
which the levels of circulating androgen are diminished
during therapy, indicating an adaptation response.
There is also a link between AR mutations and
growth factor receptors. Androgens and hormones that
activate mutated AR in LNCaP cells increase expression of
epidermal growth factor receptor expression [110]. These
findings could be explained by association between AR
and epidermal growth factor receptor [111]. Proliferative
effect of androgens and epidermal growth factor could
also be explained by their down-regulation of the cell
cycle inhibitor p27 [112].
Because of these findings one can propose the
development of preclinical and clinical inhibitors of
tyrosine kinases to inhibit the crosstalk between growth
factor receptor and AR signaling pathways. Treatment of
cells with an anti-androgen and the anti-HER2 receptor
monoclonal antibody herceptin could open the way for
novel PCa therapies. In line with these observations, the
dual ErbB1/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKI-166
was tested in series of human PCa xenografts [113]. The
effects of the inhibitor could be abolished by androgenic
administration [113].
In context of crosstalk between signaling pathways,
further aspects of inhibition of tyrosine kinases by
sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, have to be discussed.
Sorafenib inhibits proliferation and induced apoptosis in
several PCa cell lines [114]. Sorafenib is a multikinase
inhibitor that is approved for therapy of renal and liver
cancer. Androgen-sensitive PCa cells were inhibited to a
higher extent compared to androgen-insensitive ones. It
was demonstrated that several targets of sorafenib, which
were identified previously, are also inhibited in PCa
cells. It was also demonstrated that cell lines that become
resistant to endocrine and chemotherapy in PCa are at least
partially responsive to sorafenib. A higher sensitivity of
AR-positive cell lines to sorafenib could be explained by
down-regulation of AR expression.
These in vitro findings could also have clinical
implications. Although PCa is a heterogenous disease,
patients with higher expression of AR and several other
sorafenib targets may be good candidates for sorafenib
treatment. Thus, preclinical results obtained with sorafenib
may serve as a basis for the development of a more
personalized approach for PCa patients.

In summary, there are multiple interactions between
signaling pathways that include tyrosine kinase receptors
and the AR. These interactions are basis for a rational
therapeutic targeting of these interactions in clinics.

ADAPTIVE RESPONSES IN AR SIGNALING
THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF THE
SRC-AKT - AND MAPK- PATHWAYS
INACTIVATE
AR-COREPRESSORS
AND LEAD TO ENHANCED CANCER
PROGRESSION
The AR signaling is not only controlled by the
ligands of AR but also by signal transduction pathways
including the MAPK and non-receptor tyrosine kinases.
Among tyrosine kinases, Src is particularly important for
AR phosphorylation [115]. In PCa, a correlation between
AR tyrosine phosphorylation and Src tyrosine kinase
activity was observed. Importantly, AR activation by Src
was confirmed in CRPC cells [116, 117].
Intracellular kinases that mediate the signal
transduction of membrane associated receptor tyrosine
kinases are often linked to cellular growth and seem to
play a critical role in cancer development and progression.
The family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including
Src, are activated by and interact with various cellular
pathways and regulate a plethora of different pathways
including cell proliferation, cell motility, invasion,
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resistance to
apoptosis, and metastatic spread (reviewed in: [118, 119].
Src expression is upregulated in human CRPC cells [116,
118, 120]. Several lines of evidence indicate that the
expression of Src and Src kinase family members can
drive the formation of PCa or the progression to CRPC
[118]. Interestingly the interaction of AR with Src has
been shown to lead to AR activation by phosphorylation
of AR [115].
Another underlying molecular basis to activate the
AR by the Src family has been suggested to be mediated
through inactivation of corepressors. Corepressors are
transcriptional regulators that interact with DNA-bound
transcription factors and lead to inhibition of their
transactivation. Some corepressors interact with the
amino-terminus of AR and some with the DBD, which
may be used to reduce the transcriptional activity of AR
point mutations and AR∆DBD isoforms [121].
In the presence of AR antagonists (anti-androgens),
the corepressor recruitment leads to recruitment of
chromatin repressor complexes to AR target genes or to
coactivator displacement on the AR. These mechanisms
are the molecular basis for AR inactivation mediated by
some AR antagonists [121-123]. In addition to antagonist
induced corepressor binding to AR, LCoR, a liganddependent corepressor for AR, reduces AR activity in
the presence of androgens including dihydrotestosterone
35548

Oncotarget

[117]. In contrast to non-PCa cells, LCoR has only weak
repression function in CRPC cells indicating an adaptive
response in CRPC to inactivate corepressor function.
Therefore, combination therapy of inhibitors against
Src and Src family members and against the AR may be
fruitful.
To analyze the underlying molecular mechanism, a
battery of various inhibitors of signaling pathways were
used to treat CRPC cells. The results indicated that the
LCoR silencing function is repressed by the Src-Akt
pathway [117]. Inhibition of Src signaling represses AR
target gene expression indicating that the Src family
members enhance the AR transactivation at chromatin
level. In the presence of a Src inhibitor, LCoR is more
potently recruited to AR target genes and reduced
the expression such as that of PSA. The Src-LCoRAR pathway was confirmed by LCoR expression and
inactivation of Src to regulate CRPC tumor growth of
human xenografts in mice. Thus, the Src-Akt signaling
inactivates LCoR, which subsequently activates AR
signaling in human CRPC cells in culture and in mouse
xenograft model [117].
These findings and those from other groups strongly
suggest that inhibitors of members of the Src tyrosine
kinase family in combination therapy with antagonists
may be a very useful tool to inactivate AR signaling and
progression of CRPC, which has been nicely reviewed
recently [124]. In line with this combinatorial treatment
idea, the use of PI3K inhibitors is currently under clinical
investigation in combination with AR antagonists such as
enzalutamide (UKCRN Study ID: 16580).
Similarly to LCoR, the corepressor Silencing
Mediator for Retinoid and Thyroid hormone receptors
(SMRT) seems also to be inactivated by signaling
pathways in PCa. An activated MAPK signaling was
shown to inhibit the SMRT corepressor function [125].
SMRT binds to the AR in the presence of AR antagonists
and inactivates the AR-mediated transactivation. SMRT
is recruited to AR binding sites at chromatin and recruits
the SAP30-SIN3A-HDAC repressor complex [126]. In
addition SMRT competes with the coactivator SRC1 for
the binding to AR [127]. However in PCa cells, SMRT
exhibited only little silencing activity. Analyses of various
signaling pathways suggest that the MAPK is one major
pathway that inactivates SMRT repressor function. Using
an ERK1/2 specific inhibitor, the binding of SMRT to
AR was enhanced as well as the chromatin recruitment
of SMRT to the PSA gene was increased. Furthermore,
a synergy by the co-treatment of the AR antagonist
and ERK1/2 inhibitor revealed a potent inhibition of
PCa cell growth and colony formation [125]. These
findings strongly suggest that the MAPK inactivates AR
corepressors and thereby activates the AR signaling as an
adaptive response. These observations also suggest that
inhibitors of the MAPK pathway [128] in combination
therapy with AR antagonists may be a very useful tool to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inactivate AR signaling and progression of PCa.
Thus, mitogenic signaling pathways activate the
AR signaling. One underlying molecular basis is the
inactivation of AR corepressors by the Src kinase family
members and/or the MAPK signaling. Co-treatment with
signal transduction inhibitors may be a useful tool and
therapeutic approach to inhibit CRPC. Presumably tissue
specific inhibitors of Src, PI3K, Akt and MAPK are more
useful in combination with AR inhibitors to reduce sideeffects.
Taken together, multiple adaptation processes
seem to exist that allow persistent AR signaling in PCa
(Figure 2). The detailed knowledge about possible
pathways that lead to the activation of the AR allows to
detect individualized adaptation processes in PCa and
consequently allows an optimal individualized treatment
option.
