ABSTRACT
The molecular determinants governing escape of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
cells from DNA damaging therapy remain poorly defined and account for therapy
failures. To isolate genes responsible for leukemia cells regeneration following multiple
challenges with irradiation we performed a genome-wide shRNA screen. Some of the
isolated hits are known players in the DNA damage response (e.g. p53, CHK2), whereas
other, e.g. SMYD2 lysine methyltransferase (KMT), remains uncharacterized in the
AML context. Here we report that SMYD2 knockdown confers relative resistance to
human AML cells against multiple classes of DNA damaging agents. Induction of the
transient quiescence state upon SMYD2 downregulation correlated with the resistance.
We revealed that diminished SMYD2 expression resulted in the upregulation of the
related methyltransferase SET7/9, suggesting compensatory relationships. Indeed,
pharmacological targeting of SET7/9 with (R)-PFI2 inhibitor preferentially inhibited
the growth of cells expressing low levels of SMYD2.
Finally, decreased expression of SMYD2 in AML patients correlated with the reduced
sensitivity to therapy and lower probability to achieve complete remission. We propose
that the interplay between SMYD2 and SET7/9 levels shifts leukemia cells from growth
to quiescence state that is associated with the higher resistance to DNA damaging
agents and rationalize SET7/9 pharmacological targeting in AML.

INTRODUCTION

cells (HSPC) [1]. Despite the recent advances in our
understanding of AML genetics and extensive modeling
of the disease in vitro and in vivo the long-term survival
remains dismal especially for elder patients [1–3].
Experimental evidences based on thymidine labeling [4],
AML cell sorting into subpopulations followed by xenotransplantation [5, 6], and in-vitro clonogenic assays [7],
indicate that out of billions of AML blasts populating the

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous
group of blood malignancies characterized by accumulation
of malignant blast cells in the patient’s bone marrow [1].
AML arises due to deregulation of molecular pathways

bone marrow, only a minor fraction display sufficient
self-renewal capacity to propagate the disease. Due to
the similarity in the assays used to define self-renewing
leukemic blasts and their functional resemblance to normal
HSPC, these leukemic cells are designated leukemia stem
cells (LSC) [8–11].
DNA-damaging agents in the form of cytarabineanthracycline combination constitutes the mainstay of
the remission induction therapy for the majority of AML
subtypes for the last four decades [1]. Indeed, exponentially
growing AML cells are rapidly killed by this genotoxic
regimen and the majority of patients enter a remission stage.
Unfortunately, AML cells grow back in more than 60%
of the patients, causing leukemia relapse-thus, indicating
LSC persistence during and after the treatment [3, 12]. It is
therefore clear that these therapy-persistent cells represent
the critical and largely unexplored target population in
terms of therapy.
DNA double strand breaks generated via different
modes of action by anti-leukemia drugs [13, 14], as well
as by ionizing radiation (IR), initiate activation of intricate
DNA damage response (DDR) signaling networks that alter
cellular fate toward either survival or cell death. For some
DDR factors, pro- (p53, PUMA) and anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2,
Mcl-1) roles are well documented. In contrast, additional
DDR genes (e.g. ATM, NF-kB, c-myc) may enhance
chemosensitivity or confer resistance depending on the
cellular context and drug type [15, 16]. In recent years the
role of epigenetic modifiers in regulation of the DNA double
strand break repair, cell cycle checkpoints and ultimately
cell survival has emerged. Several lysine methyltransferases
(KMTs), including G9a, Dot1L, SMYD2, EZH2 and Set7/9,
were shown to regulate patterns of gene expression and cell
fate via modifying key lysine residues on histones (H3,
H4, H2B), transcription factors (p53, NF-kB), cell cycle
regulators (Rb) and signaling kinases (MAPKAPK3) [17,
18]. As a result, small molecule inhibitors targeting some of
these enzymes (e.g. DOT1L, EZH2) are currently in clinical
trials for leukemia treatment [19].
Despite this remarkable progress it is clear that
current DNA damaging and even targeted therapies unable
to eliminate all leukemia regenerating cells, and thus,
additional molecular determinants governing escape of
these cells must exist and remain largely undefined. Given
the high molecular and cellular heterogeneity of human
AML and the growing appreciation of the complexity
of the DDR, novel strategies that can pinpoint these
resistance determinants should be developed in parallel.
Functional genomic screen, based on RNA
interference mediated by shRNAs is a robust and unbiased
approach to identify genes mediating resistance and
sensitivity phenotypes [20, 21]. In this work we employed
a whole genome shRNA screen to identify regulators
of leukemia cell survival and regeneration after multiple
rounds of genotoxic therapy. As a result we found that
SMYD2 KMT knockdown confers relative resistance to

multiple classes of DNA damaging agents. Induction of
the transient dormancy in leukemia cells upon SMYD2
downregulation correlated with the increased DNA
damage resistance, but make cells vulnerable to SET7/9
methyltransferase-specific inhibitor. AML patients with
decreased SMYD2 have a lower likelihood of benefitting
from standard chemotherapy. Thus, our study underscores
the power of functional screening for resistance mediators
and rationalizes SET7/9 pharmacological targeting in AML.

RESULTS
Genome wide shRNA screen identifies SMYD2
as a negative regulator of leukemia cell
regeneration after genotoxic stress
Regeneration of normal hematopoietic stem and
progenitor (HSPC) as well as leukemia cells after DNA
damage relies on cellular pathways that coordinate stress,
survival and ultimately preservation of proliferative
potential in the subset of viable cells [15]. IR potently
suppresses normal HSPC regeneration via apoptosis and
a number of cell death-independent pathways, including
precipitous differentiation and senescence [22–25]. As
such, numerous genes that participate in IR-induced DDR
are key regulators of HSPC functions, including p53, ATM,
Bcl2 and others [26]. To identify novel DDR regulators
that mediate leukemia cell survival after IR, we utilized a
pooled genome-wide lentiviral shRNA screen for genes that
regulate cell recovery after 4 rounds of sublethal irradiation
(4 Gy) (Figure 1A). In this screen we utilized the “stem celllike” human hematopoietic cell line TEX generated via TLSERG leukemia fusion oncogene expression in cord-blood
derived HSPC [27]. This leukemia model line maintains
functional heterogeneity (only a minority of cells function
as leukemia stem cells in a xenotransplantation setting),
cytokine dependency (IL-3, SCF), and a functional p53
pathway. These features allowed us to use these cells as
a “surrogate model” to study the biology of LSC [28]. A
lentiviral shRNA library containing 80000 shRNA clones
targeting approximately 16000 human genes was used to
infect TEX cells at low multiplicity of infection to ensure
representation of the library clones. Then one half of the
library-transduced TEX cells were exposed to 4Gy of IR
and the other half served as a control. This dose of IR (4Gy)
resulted in the dramatic increase in cell death, such as only
a low numbers of viable cells remained at 6–7 days post
IR followed by the gradual regeneration (Supplementary
Figure 1). We performed 4 cycles of IR and regeneration
in order to enrich for the most potent shRNA clones and
mimic multiple cycles of genotoxic therapy used in cancer
treatment. Notably, TEX cells infected with the lentiviral
shRNA library exhibited a remarkable increase in cell
recovery rates following each round of sublethal irradiation,
thus confirming the maintenance of regenerative potential
and gain of enhanced survival (Figure 1B, compare 400RX1

with 400RX4). Non–infected, but similarly irradiated,
parental cells did not demonstrate accelerated recovery,
thereby ruling out the possibility of pre-existing resistant
variants (Figure 1C, compare 400RX1 with 400RX4). We
performed DNA deep sequencing of TEX cells regenerated
after four rounds of IR and identified a set of shRNA clones
strongly enriched in this experimental arm compared with
the non-irradiated counterparts (Table 1) suggesting that the
genes targeted by these shRNAs are important mediators of
stress persistence and regeneration in leukemia cells. Indeed,
known regulators of DDR such as CHK2 and p53 were

identified in our screen (ranked 1 and 11 respectively from
15983 gene targets), thus validating our screen platform. In
addition, a number of novel, potential regulators of leukemia
cells DDR were found (Table 1). Validation experiment
using TEX cells infected with individual shRNA targeting
top candidates confirmed potent regeneration advantage of
irradiated leukemia cells upon knockdown of CHK2, p53
and SMYD2 genes (Figure 1D). Enhanced regeneration
was correlated with a reduction in the respective mRNA and
protein levels pointing to the on-target effect (Figure 1E,
Supplementary Figure 2). As the role of SMYD2 in

leukemia cells growth and regeneration remains largely
unexplored we decided to focus on this candidate.

In contrast, downregulation of SMYD2 did not alter IRinduced cell death rate. These results suggest that the
protective effect of SMYD2 on leukemia cell regeneration
after irradiation is most probably apoptosis-independent.

SMYD2 knockdown rescues irradiated leukemia
clonogenic cells in an apoptosis-independent
manner

SMYD2 knockdown induces quiescence in
leukemia cells

To validate potential mechanisms by which SMYD2
participates in leukemia cells survival/recovery following
DNA damage we measured IR-induced cell death upon
SMYD2 knockdown. To that end we employed human
leukemia line OCI-AML2 that possesses intact DNA
damage regulators p53 [29] and CHK2 (this study)
(Figure 2A). Irradiation (4Gy) of this line strongly
diminished their clonogenic potential. SMYD2 knockdown
using two independent SMYD2 shRNAs resulted in a 2-3
fold rescue of clonogenic capacity (Figure 2A). Similarly,
SMYD2 knockdown in TEX cells led to the 4-fold increase
in survival post Etoposide treatment as measured by the
culture-initiating cell frequency analysis (Supplementary
Figure 3). Knockdown of CHK2 and p53 genes also resulted
in the rescue of irradiated OCI-AML2 clonogenic cells to
a similar extent (Figure 2A). We confirmed the efficient
knockdown of SMYD2, CHK2 and p53 genes with their
respected shRNAs (Figure 2B). Decrease in the IR-induced
apoptosis can be one of the mechanisms responsible for
the rescue of irradiated cells clonogenic activity. To test
this idea, we analyzed the rate of IR-induced cell death
upon knockdown of SMYD2, p53 and CHK2 genes
(Figure 2C). As expected, leukemia cells with p53 and
CHK2 downregulation were less susceptible to IR-induced
cell death in agreement with their role in this process.

Ectopic expression of SMYD2 can either enhance
[30, 31] or inhibit [32] cellular growth, probably acting
in a cell type dependent manner. To investigate the role
of the endogenous SMYD2 in leukemia cell proliferation
we analyzed the expansion of OCI-AML2 cells infected
with shSMYD2 lentiviruses. We detected a transient
attenuation in cell growth rate without detectable changes
in cellular viability upon SMYD2 knockdown that lasted
for 5–7 days followed by the growth rate restoration
(Figure 3A). In agreement with the described changes in
proliferation, we observed an approximately 50% decrease
in the frequency of clonogenic leukemia cells shortly after
SMYD2 downregulation (3–5 days post infection) followed
by a restoration of clonogenicity to the shControl levels at
the later period (day 10 post infection) (Figure 3B, 3C). Of
note, SMYD2 protein was consistently downregulated for
the whole period of observation (Supplementary Figure
4). Taking into consideration the lower expansion rates of
cells with diminished SMYD2 levels, we hypothesized that
SMYD2 may affect cell cycle distribution. Using Ki-67 as a
marker for cellular quiescence (G0), we revealed that up to
50% of OCI-AML2 cells with decreased levels of SMYD2
exist in the G0 state of the cell cycle at the end of puromycin
selection period (designated D0) relative to only 10% of
4

Oncotarget

the control cells (Figure 3D, 3E). The fraction of Ki-67(quiescent cells) in shSMYD2 expressing cells gradually
decreased to the shControl level by Day 7 in agreement with
only transient attenuation of cell growth achieved by the
constitutive SMYD2 knockdown (Supplementary Figure 5).
To explore whether physiological regulators of leukemia
cells quiescence, such as growth factors, can affect SMYD2
expression we utilized a growth-factor-dependent AML-193
leukemia line [33, 34]. In this model, GM-CSF withdrawal
induces accumulation of cells in G0 as validated by the
decreased Pyronin Y intensity (Figure 3F left panel). Western
blot analysis revealed lower SMYD2 protein levels in the
quiescence-enriched AML-193 cells relative to their actively
dividing counterparts (Figure 3F right panel). These results
reveal that leukemia growth factors can regulate SMYD2
levels. In correlation with the enlarged quiescent fraction
upon SMYD2 knockdown we detected elevated levels of
p21 mRNA and protein - observation consistent with its role
in regulation of leukemia cells quiescence (Figure 3G, 3H)
[35]. To provide a functional validation of the enhanced
quiescence state induced upon SMYD2 knockdown we
treated control and shSMYD2 expressing cells with a
chemotherapeutic drug cytarabine that kills proliferating
cells by interfering with DNA synthesis. Indeed, shSMYD2expressing cells exhibited relative resistance to cytarabine
(Figure 3I). Of note, whereas SMYD2 knockdown resulted
in proliferation attenuation, SMYD2 overexpression did
not affect OCI-AML2 cells proliferation or IR-induced cell
death (Supplementary Figure 6). These results reveal that
SMYD2 downregulation promotes the entry of leukemia
cells into quiescence state associated with the increased
resistance to anti-leukemia chemotherapy.

inquired whether SMYD2 mediated leukemia cells
growth arrest is mediated by p53. For that purpose we
generated OCI-AML2 cells with the functionally inactive
p53 via overexpressing GSE56 peptide that acts in a
dominant-negative fashion (p53DN) and attenuates p53mediated transactivation and apoptosis [22, 38]. SMYD2
downregulation resulted in the lower expansion rates of
both control and p53DN expressing cells (Figure 4A left and
right panels). In agreement with the decreased proliferation
rates, SMYD2 downregulation strongly reduced colonyforming ability of both control and p53DN expressing cells
(Figure 4B). Moreover, SMYD2 inactivation resulted in
the measurable upregulation of p21 in the absence of the
functional p53 (Figure 4C). These results demonstrate
that SMYD2 downregulation can attenuate leukemia cell
growth via p53-independent mechanisms.

SMYD2 downregulation leads to SET7/9
upregulation in leukemia cells
Transient leukemia cell growth arrest upon SMYD2
downregulation followed by the return to the normal
proliferation rate, as we reported above, can indicate
activation of the compensatory mechanisms in response
to changes in the SMYD2 levels and/or activity. In
pursuance of a candidate gene that can overcome this
SMYD2 knock-down mediated growth arrest we analyzed
the expression of several KMTs with the similar structural
and functional features to SMYD2 [39]. Our candidate
methyltransferase list involved additional members of the
SMYD family (SMYD3, SMYD4 and SMYD5), MLL
family (MLL3 and MLL4) and structurally-related SET7/9
(SETD7). First, we examined their mRNA levels in OCIAML2 and TEX cell lines infected with shSMYD2 and
control shRNAs at the different time points post-infection
(Supplementary Figure 7). Of those, only SET7/9 mRNA
was consistently up regulated in the shSMYD2 expressing
cells as compared to the control shRNA expressing cells

SMYD2 downregulation induces p53independent growth inhibition in leukemia cells
Since p53 is one of the SMYD2 substrates [36]
and a regulator of cell cycle progression [37], we

(Figure 5A). Consistently with mRNA upregulation,
SET7/9 protein levels were also increased upon SMYD2
knock-down in a number of cell lines tested (Figure 5B).
We also revealed that SMYD2 ectopic expression led to

the SET7/9 protein downregulation, further substantiating
potential functional interactions between these two related
KMTs (Figure 5C). In order to test whether SET7/9
upregulation in cells with diminished SMYD2 levels is

functionally important we utilized recently described
inhibitor of SET7/9 methyltransferase activity (R)-PFI-2
[40]. We found that (R)-PFI-2 inhibited the growth
of OCI-AML2 cells expressing shSMYD2, whereas
proliferation of the shControl expressing cells was mostly
unaffected (Figure 5D and Supplementary Table 1).
Collectively, these results reveal the existence of the
functional cross-talk between SMYD2 and SET7/9 lysine
methyltransferases.

in determining primary AML drug sensitivity and patient
survival we utilized leukemia patient derived samples.
Firstly, we determined the sensitivity of a wide spectrum
of primary AML and CML samples (N = 63) to the DNA
damaging drug Etoposide (Figure 6A). Primary samples
were incubated with Etoposide for 24 hrs followed by the
72 hrs long recovery period prior to viability determination
using Presto blue based colorimetric assay. We found
that primary leukemia samples exhibited heterogeneous
sensitivity to Etoposide, which allowed separation into two
groups. Those AML samples whose growth was inhibited
at 10 μM Etoposide were designated “Etoposide sensitive,
(EtopS)”, whereas the less affected samples constituted
the “Etoposide resistant, (EtopR)” group. Importantly,
EtopS samples also exhibited higher susceptibility to the
additional genotoxic agents Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone
relative to the EtopR group (Figure 6B and 6C). Of note,

Our results using cell lines revealed the involvement
of SMYD2 in regulation of leukemia cell growth, survival

these chemotherapeutics are standard of care in AML
treatment. Consistency in sensitivity profiles across multiple
drugs validated this AML samples set as a useful platform
to investigate molecular regulators responsible for the
differential therapy sensitivity [28 and unpublished]. Gene
expression profiling of EtopS (n = 12) and EtopR (n = 12)
samples was undertaken to characterize gene signatures
associated with chemotherapy response. To assess whether
genes identified in our functional shRNA screen (Table
1, top 200 candidates) play a role in Etoposide sensitivity
determination of primary AML samples, we analyzed the
overlap between the two datasets. This analysis revealed 49
candidates (out of the top 200) that were also differentially
expressed (FDR < 0.05) in EtopS and EtopR samples
(Figure 6D). More significantly, 33 out of 49 candidates,

including functionally validated SMYD2 and CHK2 genes,
demonstrated significantly lower expression in EtopR
samples (Figure 6D). This association is in agreement with
the overall functional screen rationale and strongly supports
our results demonstrating that SMYD2 knockdown confers
relative resistance to genotoxic stress.
To test whether SMYD2 levels can predict the
response of AML patients to chemotherapy we measured
its mRNA abundance in peripheral blood or bone marrow
blasts of 71 AML patients treated according to a standard
remission induction protocol (Cytarabine and Daunorubicin
combination) [41]. The average SMYD2 expression level
in 39 patients that achieved complete remission (CR) was
significantly higher than that in 25 patients that had noresponse (NR) (p < 0.05) (Figure 6E). These results indicate

likelihood of benefitting from standard chemotherapy. Of
interest, extracting SMYD2 expression values from the
Oncomine cancer array database [42] revealed that SMYD2

levels in AML are lower than in Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia (ALL) (Supplementary Figure 8).
Collectively, our analysis of primary AML samples

with subsequent changes in the activity of a plethora of
cellular proteins can account for its regulation of cell cycle,
quiescence and survival. Indeed, SMYD2 methylation of
histone H3 on lysine 36 and lysine 4 reported to promote
repression [32] and activation [51] of the distinct gene
subsets. In addition, SMYD2-dependent methylation
alters the activity of nuclear and cytoplasmic non-histone
proteins including p53 [36], Rb [30, 52], estrogen receptor
alpha [53], Hsp90 [54, 55], PTEN [56], MAPKAPK3 [57]
and numerous other [58–60]. Transcriptional induction of
p21 cell cycle inhibitor in leukemia cells with decreased
SMYD2 levels can also account for the observed transient
quiescence [61] and more efficient DNA damage response
critical for the enhanced survival [35].
p53
transcription
factor
regulates
p21
expression [62], promotes cell cycle arrest [37, 63] and also
undergoes SMYD2-dependent repression via methylation
on Lys370 [36]. Thus, p53/p21 axis can account for
SMYD2 mediated growth arrest. In the leukemia cell lines
model we employed, SMYD2 downregulation induced p21
and cell growth inhibition in a p53-independent manner.
Similarly, SMYD2 knockdown reduced proliferation of
cells expressing mutant or no p53 [31]. Although the exact
mechanism/s by which SMYD2 deregulation leads to p21
induction remains to be identified several mechanisms can
be proposed. For instance, knockdown of SMYD2 inhibited
Akt phosphorylation via decreased PTEN methylation that
resulted in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells
[56]. Under these circumstances, FoxO transcription factor
will undergo activation and can induce p21 expression [64].
Recent study also implicated SET7/9 in the regulation of
E2F1 transcriptional targets, including p73, that is known
regulator of p21 [65, 66]. Given these complexity, multiple
rather than a single SMYD2 target might be implicated in
its effect on leukemia cell growth.
Upregulation of SET7/9 KMT mRNA and protein
specifically in SMYD2 knockdown cells, as we discovered
in this study, can provide a clue toward the cellular
substrate and molecular pathways involved in SMYD2mediated growth regulation and stress resistance. A
noticeable feature of the methyltransferase-substrate
network in general, and of SET7/9 and SMYD2 KMTs in
particular, is their substrate promiscuity so that different
KMTs can methylate the same protein regulating its
activity [18, 67]. Indeed, SMYD2 and SET7/9 bind
and modify the activity of histone H3, p53, Rb, ERa
and possibly other proteins. Smyd2-dependent binding,
methylation and regulation of SET7/9 promoter associated
transcription factors might provide plausible mechanism
for the discovered interplay between the two KMTs.
Of note, SET7/9 and SMYD2 methylation on p53, for
example, are mutually inhibitory and the crosstalk between
them and additional posttranslational modifications can
lead to the distinct functional outcomes under different
biological conditions [18, 67, 68]. Enhanced sensitivity of
SMYD2 knockdown cells to the specific SET7/9 inhibitor

DISCUSSION
Molecular determinants of AML resistance to
standard DNA damaging agents remain elusive and
account, at least partially, for the treatment failure.
Expression profiling and more recently high throughput
DNA sequencing technologies provided biomedical
community with rich inventory of genes that are aberrantly
expressed or function in AML. These powerful descriptive
methods also highlighted high genetic and epigenetic
heterogeneity of human AML [43–45]. However, the genes
that actually mediate therapy resistance and thus directly
impact the treatment outcome and patients’ survival is
difficult to extract from these datasets. In this study we
utilized a genome-wide functional screen to rapidly enrich
for shRNAs that confer relative regenerative advantage to
leukemia cells after repetitive DNA damage insults. In
addition to SMYD2, whose role in AML sensitivity to
DNA damage is novel and discussed below, our top list
shRNAs included several well-annotated (p53 and CHK2)
and proposed (PAOX [46]) determinants of cellular
resistance to stress. Beyond these genes, our functional
screen also identified numerous radiation resistance
conferring shRNA clones that target genes previously
unconnected with DNA damage response and that await
experimental validation. These positive results further
highlight the power of functional genetic [20, 47] and
small molecules based [28, 48] screens to identify novel
resistance determinants.
Cell survival at the onset of genotoxic injury relies
on the activation of the signaling pathways regulating DNA
repair, cell cycle checkpoints and cell death [15]. In response
to IR, cells in which SMYD2 was downregulated underwent
cell death at the levels similar to the parental control line.
Despite the similarity in the cell death rates, irradiated
shSMYD2 expressing cells formed more colonies in a
clonogenic assay pointing to the involvement of cell death
independent mechanisms. Indeed, careful examination of the
cell cycle distribution revealed strongly elevated quiescent
(G0) and reduced S phase compartments in leukemia cells
with decreased SMYD2 levels. This transient quiescence
is likely contributes to the observed radio- and cytarabine
resistance in our experiments and was postulated to be a
critical mechanism for therapy resistance of normal and
leukemic stem cells in patients and mouse models [49]. The
involvement of SMYD2 in regulation of cell proliferation
was suggested previously. Indeed, overexpression of
SMYD2 stimulated proliferation of esophageal squamous
cancer cell lines, but inhibited growth of murine fibroblasts
and Embryonic Stem Cells indicating strong cell type
dependency [31, 32, 50]. Moreover, knockdown of SMYD2
attenuated growth of several epithelial and mesenchyme
derived cancer lines [30, 31]. SMYD2 mediated methylation

supports the notion that these two KMTs converge on the
regulation of the same substrate and/or pathway.
In this study we revealed that SMYD2 underexpression correlated positively with the resistance of
primary human AML samples to several genotoxic agents.
Importantly, we have revealed that low SMYD2 expression
predicted no-response of the AML patients to the standard
induction chemotherapy. In line with our findings in AML,
low levels of SMYD2 correlated with shorter survival in
patients with renal cell carcinoma [69] and acquisition of
complex karyotype and disease progression in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia [70]. In other tumor types, including
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [31], gastric
carcinoma [71], acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [72]
and HPV-unrelated head and neck carcinoma [73], SMYD2
overexpression was associated with disease aggressiveness
and worse outcome. These seemingly opposing clinical
observations might stem from the tissue-specific or disease
stage-specific functions of SMYD2. For instance, many
fold higher expression of SMYD2 in ALL vs. AML, as
revealed by our bioinformatics analysis might be required
to sustain the rapid proliferation of ALL blast cells [74]. In
contrast to ALL, low levels of SMYD2 can contribute to the
maintenance of the largely quiescent AML stem cells [75].
Future study of SMYD2 function in the functionally
different AML cellular compartments might validate this
hypothesis. Genetically engineered murine models of
cancer further emphasize tissue- specific and oncogenespecific roles of SMYD2 in tumorigenesis. Indeed, complete
ablation of SMYD2 in the K-Ras/p53-/- model of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [57] and MLL/AF9-N-Ras leukemia
model [76] revealed minor delay in the disease onset or no
difference in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis [76].
In conclusion, we revealed that SMYD2 levels regulate
leukemia cell proliferation and response to genotoxic
stress. We propose that the interplay between SMYD2 and
SET7/9 KMTs levels shifts leukemia cells from growth to
quiescence state that is associated with the higher resistance
to several DNA damaging agents. Better understanding of the
methylation targets and molecular pathways affected by these
enzymes might be beneficial for the rationale use of the small
molecule KMT inhibitors in AML and other types of cancer.

min, 1500 rpm and allowed to recover for 24 h. Next
day cells were washed from the virus and incubated for
additional 24 hours followed by Puromycin addition.
The following selection conditions were used: Jurkat
(0.3 µg/ml Puromycin for 3 days), OCI-AML2 (2 µg/ml
Puromycin for 3 days). After selection completion, cells
were replated for the downstream experiments. This point
was designated “day 0”.

or SET7/9 inhibitor. Cell expansion was calculated by
viable cell counting using Trypan Blue dye.

Genome-wide shRNA library screen
Logarithmically growing TEX cells (80 × 106 cells)
were infected with a genome scale lentivirus library
consisting of ~78,432 shRNAs targeting 16,056 unique
RefSeq genes [77]. Cells were infected at multiplicity
of infection that results in 30% survival after puromycin
selection (0.7 μg/ml for 48 hours) to ensure a single shRNA
clone integration per cell. After puromycin selection
completion, dead cells were removed by washing and
the culture was divided for irradiation (4Gy) and control
experimental arms (30 or 60 × 106 cells respectively). The
reference sample (D0, 30 × 106) was frozen down. After
irradiation, cells were allowed to regenerate with regular
medium changes till their number reached that of the initial
input (~14 days). At this point (designated 4 Gy × 1) part
of the cells were exposed to the second dose of 4Gy and
left for an additional regeneration cycle (4 Gy × 2). In
total, for this screen TEX cells were exposed to 16Gy of
IR. Aliquots (30 × 106 cells) of irradiated and sham treated
cells were collected at different time points. Genomic
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit
(Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation. Genomic DNA was extracted from
triplicate D0, D10, D21, D31 non-irradiated and 4 Gy ×
1, 4 Gy × 2, 4 Gy × 3, 4 Gy × 4 survivors. pLKO1 vector
derived primers flanking unique shRNA sequences were
used for PCR amplification to generate a library of shRNA
products for next generation sequencing. From sequencing
reads, the abundance of shRNA clone in the non-treated
and irradiated samples was determined. shRNA clones
that demonstrated relative enrichment in the repeatedly
irradiated samples were selected for further validation.

Drug sensitivity, cell cycle and viability analysis
Etoposide and Ara-C (both from Sigma, Israel)
were added to cells at the indicated concentrations for
24 h followed by drug wash. Cells were cultured in
drug-free medium for 72 hours and relative cell growth
was quantitated using PrestoBlue® Cell Viability Assay
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Rhenium, Israel) using a
multiplate reader (SpectraMax 340PC, Molecular Devices
Corp, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Cells
were exposed to ionizing radiation using Cs-137 source
at the dose rate 2.8 Gy/min using GMBH BioBeam 8000
gamma irradiation device (Gamma service, UK).
To quantitate clonogenic growth potential of the
leukemic cells we plated shControl and shSMYD2
expressing OCI-AML2 cells (500 cells/plate and 5000
cells/plate respectively) in MethoCult™ H4100 (Stem Cell
Technologies, Canada) supplemented with FBS (30%,
MultiCell, Canada), 5637 cells conditioned medium
(10%), L-Glu (1%) and P/S (1%), 2-mercaptoethanol
(50 µM). Cells were plated at day 0 or at day 10 from the
end of puromycin selection. Colonies were counted under
the microscope after 14 days of incubation.
To induce quiescence, AML-193 leukemia cells
were washed three times with PBS and replated into
IMDM supplemented with BIT-9500 for 4 days. Quiescent
fraction was determined using Hoechst 33342 /Pyronin Y
staining. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were stained with Hoechst
33342 (10 µg/ml, Life Technologies, Rhenium, Israel),
incubated for 45 min at 37°C followed by addition of
500 ng/ml Pyronin Y (Sigma, Israel) for additional 15 min.
For Ki-67 analysis, cells transduced with different
shRNAs were fixed in formaldehyde (1.4%), permeabilized
in ethanol (100%) followed by labeling with Ki-67
antibody conjugated with AxFluor488 (Invitrogen).
DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1 μg/ml) was added
to visualize DNA content.
Apoptosis was measured using Annexin-V and
SYTOX™ Blue dead cell stain (Invitrogen) according
to manufacturer’s protocols. Cells were analyzed with
Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Flow cytometry
data were analyzed using Kaluza flow cytometry analysis
software (Beckman-Coulter).
Inhibition of SET7/9 was done by adding DMSO or
10 µM of (R)-PFI2 to 1 × 105 OCI-AML2 cells infected
with shControl or shSMYD2. Every 3 days cells were
counted and 1 × 105 cells were replated with fresh DMSO

Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript III
(Invitrogen). Real-time PCR reactions were prepared with
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in
triplicates and analyzed on Applied Biosystems 7900HT
instruments. Absolute gene expression was quantified
with SDS software (Applied Biosystems) based on the
standard curve method and presented after normalization
for GAPDH.
