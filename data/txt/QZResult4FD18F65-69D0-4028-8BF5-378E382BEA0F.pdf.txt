ABSTRACT
RY10-4, a novel protoapigenone analog, shows potent cytotoxicity against human
breast cancer cells. However, breast cancer cell lines overexpressing human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), SKBR3 and BT474, showed less sensitivity to RY104 when compared to breast cancer cells lines expressing lower levels of HER2, such
as MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. This was associated with aberrant hyperactivity in
Notch signaling in cells treated with RY10-4, since treatment with RY10-4 causes
an increase in Notch activity by 2-to3.5-fold in SKBR3 and BT474 cell lines. The
increase in activity was abrogated with a γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, or with Notch1
small-interfering RNA (si-Notch1). Cell proliferation was inhibited more effectively by
RY10-4 plus DAPT or si-Notch1 than either agent alone. RY10-4 plus DAPT increases
apoptosis in both HER2-overexpressing cell lines by two-fold compared to RY104 alone, while DAPT alone has no significant effects on apoptosis. In addition, we
previously found RY10-4 could inhibit tumor growth through the PI3K/AKT pathway.
Here we report that the combination of RY10-4 and DAPT exhibit additive suppression
on AKT phosphorylation, contributing to the anti-cancer effects. In an animal model,
this combination therapy inhibits the growth of SKBR3 tumor xenografts in nude mice
to a greater extent than treatment with either reagent alone. These results indicate
that the aberrant activation of Notch signaling impedes the inhibitory effect of RY104 on HER2-amplified cell proliferation. Furthermore, these adverse effects can be
prevented by treatment combining RY10-4 with a Notch pathway inhibitor.

This compound contains an unusual nonaromatic B-ring.
Based on this, we developed a novel compound RY10-4
(Figure S1B, Publication Number: CN 102731456 B),
which is structurally related to protoapigenone but which
exhibits better antitumor activity and fewer side effects
compared to protoapigenone in vitro and in vivo [6]. Our
recent studies show that different human breast cancer
cell lines display variable sensitivity to RY10-4. RY104 exhibits comparable growth-inhibitory effects on the

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
malignancy among women, and it is a leading cause of
cancer death in females from western countries [1]. Novel
strategies for prevention and treatment of breast cancer are
needed to minimize off-target drug-related toxicities and
to ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Protoapigenone

triple-negative cell line MDA-MB-231 and the estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive cell line MCF-7. The HER2-positive
cell lines SKBR3 and BT474 exhibit similar inhibitory
effects but less sensitivity than the other two.
Notch signaling is one of the most important signaling
cascades involved in drug resistance in tumor cells. Notch
genes encode transmembrane receptors that are highly
conserved from invertebrates to mammals. These receptors
interact with ligands expressed by adjacent cells to regulate
cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, and
survival [7]. The Notch system in vertebrates is comprised
of four receptors (Notch1-4) and at least five ligands
from the families Delta and JAG/Serrate (DSL): Deltalike(Dll)-1, Dll-3, Dll-4, JAG1, and JAG2 [8, 9]. In breast
cancer patients who received tomoxifen treatment, the
activity of Notch signaling in tumor tissue correlates with
drug resistance and poor prognosis [10]. Also, in a mouse
model, the Notch1 pathway promotes acquired resistance
to tamoxifen in serially passaged breast cancer xenografts
[11]. Similar drug resistance to Adriamycin, Cisplatin,
Etoposide, and Taxol were reported in breast cancer cells
and lymphoblastic leukemia cells, both due to intracellular
Notch1 signaling [12]. Additionally, treating mice with a
Notch inhibitor restores tamoxifen sensitivity, and inhibiting
glucocorticoid-resistant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cell lines sensitized to Notch-1 lead to glucocorticoidinduced apoptosis [10, 13]. Most interestingly, other
groups found that inhibition of Notch signaling results in
downregulation of HER2 expression, while the expression
of activated Notch1 and Hes1 is significantly increased after
treatment with trastuzumab, a HER2 inhibitor [14, 15]. This
indicates that Notch signaling occurs upstream of HER2
signaling, and HER2 negatively regulates Notch expression.
Based on our previous data reporting that RY10-4
inhibits HER2 expression in SKBR3 cells, we propose that
decreased HER2 expression induces hyperactive Notch
signaling, a possible mechanism of drug resistance caused
by RY10-4 treatment. Here, we report aberrant hyperactive
Notch signaling in HER2-overexpressing cells SKBR3
and BT474 in response to RY10-4 treatment, opposing the
apoptotic effects of RY10-4. Inhibition of Notch signaling
by the γ-secretase blocker DAPT or siNotch1 sensitizes
breast cancer cells to RY10-4 in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
our data illustrates that RY10-4 holds promising antitumor activity against triple-negative breast cancer and
ER-positive breast cancer. In combination with a Notch
inhibitor, RY10-4 offers a new opportunity in HER2positive breast cancer therapy.

breast cancer cells, but the HER-2 overexpressing
SKBR3 cell line proves less sensitive to RY10-4 than
cell lines expressing lower levels of HER2, such as
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. To specifically address
this question, we treated two commonly used HER2overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, SKBR3 and BT474, with RY10-4 for 24 hours. We further evaluated
the anti-proliferation effects of RY10-4 using two
independent colorimetric assays, methylene blue (Figure
1A) and tetrazolium salt (MTT, Figure 1B). Both HER2negtive cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were more
sensitive to RY10-4. Cell proliferation in this cell lines
was inhibited about two-fold compared to the SKBR3
and BT-474 cell lines.

RY10-4 increases Notch-1 transcriptional
activity and expression of endogenous Notch
targets in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells
Since activation of Notch signaling in response to
HER2 targeted treatment is responsible for drug resistance
[17, 18], we first examined Notch activity in four breast
cancer cells lines (SKBR3, BT474, MCF-7, and MDAMB-231) in response to RY10-4 treatment. The results show
that treatment with RY10-4 increases Notch transcriptional
activity three-fold in SKBR3 and two-fold in BT-474
compared to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Figure 2A),
as measured by a C protein binding factor 1/Suppressor of
Hairless/Lag1 (CSL) reporter assay.
We then measured expression of Notch and
downstream target mRNAs in these cell lines in response
to RY10-4 treatment. Both HER2-overexpressing cell lines,
SKBR3 and BT474, show increased expression of Notch
receptor genes (Notch1 and Notch4) and Notch target genes
(Hes1 and Hey1) after RY10-4 treatment. Although RY10-4
increases Notch signaling in both HER2-positive cell lines,
the expression of genes for Notch ligands is slightly reduced
or unchanged only in BT474 cells. This discrepancy may be
explained by the existence of different molecule footprints
of different breast cancer subtypes [19]. Expression of Notch
signaling genes is decreased or unchanged in MCF-7 cells
and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2B−2G and Figure S2).
Furthermore, RY10-4 treatment causes elevated protein
expression of the endogenous Notch target Hes1 and
activated Notch1 (cleaved Notch1) proteins by two-to-eightfold in SKBR3 cells and BT474 cells. However, in MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells, protein levels remain unchanged
upon RY10-4 treatment (Figure 3). These results suggested
that RY10-4 increases Notch activity in HER2-positive
breast cancer cells.
In addition, we tested MAPK and Wnt signaling
pathways in SKBR3 cells to determine whether RY10-4
affects multiple signaling pathways involved in cell
survival. Interestingly, protein levels of phospho-p38,
phospho-JNK, phospho-LRP6, and wnt3a do not change
in response to RY10-4 treatment (Figure S3). These results

effect in the RY10-4-sensitive cell lines, MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7, suggesting that the increased anti-proliferation
effects of DAPT and RY10-4 in HER2-overexpressing cells
are specifically mediated by inhibiting the Notch pathway.
As expected, untreated cells (vehicle control) exhibit
normal shape with clear outlines. Growth of the RY10-4treated cells is inhibited when compared with control cells
and DAPT-treated cells. Further, the cells treated with RY10-4
became rounded and detached. Cell shrinkage and membrane
blebbing were also observed (Figure 4B, Figure S5C). These
data indicate that cells undergo RY10-4-mediated apoptosis.
Notably, RY10-4 markedly induces apoptosis when delivered
in combination with DAPT, as measured by Annexin V-PE
staining (Figure 4C−4D, Figure  S5D). In sharp contrast,
DAPT fails to enhance RY10-4-mediated apoptosis in MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells.
Since DAPT preferentially affects Notch1 activity, we
sought to determine whether the RY10-4-induced increase in
Notch activation is due to specifically Notch1. To do this,
we determined the effect of Notch1-specific knockdown

Down-regulation of Notch sensitizes HER-2 positive
breast cancer cells to RY10-4
To determine the role of Notch signaling in mediating
drug resistance to RY10-4 in HER2-overexpressing cells, we
studied the effect of combining RY10-4 treatment with DAPT,
a highly specific γ-secretase inhibitor that blocks Notch
endoprotrolysis [20]), on cell viability using two HER2positive cell lines (SKBR3 and BT-474) and two HER2negative cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7). The antiproliferation effect was evaluated using the colony formation
assay or the MTT assay. RY10-4 at a concentration of 1
μM markedly suppresses cell growth when compared with
vehicle control (Figure 4A, Figure  S4, Figure S5A−S5B).
Greater suppression is observed with the combinational use
of DAPT (5 μM) and RY10-4 (1 μM) in both SKBR3 and BT474 cell lines. In contrast, we did not observe a synergistic

Combination of RY10-4 and DAPT inhibit Notch
signaling and AKT activation

on cell proliferation and apoptosis using si-Notch1.
The results show that Notch1 siRNA almost completely
abolishes Notch1 protein expression (Figure 5D) and also
prevents the increase in CSL reporter activity initially
observed upon treating cells with RY10-4 (Figure 5A).
In cell proliferation experiments, cell growth is reduced
by 40% in response to RY10-4 alone and by more than
60% upon combining RY10-4 with si-Notch1 (Figure
5C). In addition, combination treatment further induces
cell apoptosis in SKBR3 cells according to morphological
study of cell shape (Figure 5B). These findings show that
the addition of a Notch inhibitor to RY10-4 treatment
is significantly more effective than RY10-4 alone in
suppressing both HER2-overexpressing cell lines.

Since Notch activates the PI3K/AKT pathway
[21, 22] and since AKT activation is necessary for
Notch-conferred resistance to apoptosis [23], we
assessed the effect of combining RY10-4 treatment with
DAPT on Notch signaling and AKT phosphorylation in
SKBR3 cells. First, SKBR3 cells express two-fold higher
levels of active Notch1 (cleaved Notch1) and eight-fold
higher levels of Hes1 protein in response to RY10-4
treatment compared to vehicle control. The increase in
cleaved-Notch1 and Hes1 expression is prevented by
treatment with DAPT (Figure 6A). We next showed that

RY10-4 alone, at a concentration of 0.2 μM, was sufficient
to inhibit AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 by 50% in
SKBR3 cells, and this increased to 95% with DAPT
(Figure 6B). Similar results are seen in BT474 cells (Figure
S6). Interestingly, treating either HER2-positive cells
with DAPT alone proves ineffective in inhibiting AKT
phosphorylation (Figure 6B lane 2 and Figure S6 lane 5),
which suggests that the Notch signaling is suppressed in
the HER2-amplified cells [14]. Thus, DAPT cannot inhibit
AKT phosphorylation through the Notch pathway. Taken
together, these data show that the combination of RY10-4
and DAPT inhibits Notch signaling and Notch-stimulated
AKT activation.

treatment groups in either experiment, suggesting that the
combination of DAPT and RY10-4 does not significantly
increase systemic toxicity (data not shown). In summary,
DAPT treatment enhances the anti-tumor effects of
RY10-4, but it exerts no effect if used alone in nude mice
bearing SKBR3 tumors.
To evaluate the effects of combined and singleagent treatments on SKBR3 cells, we examined levels of
Notch and caspase-3 activity by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 7E). Protein levels of HES1 in SKBR3 tumors
are decreased in mice treated with DAPT. In contrast,
treatment with RY10-4 results in a great increase in both
Dll4 and Hes1 expression, suggesting that Notch signaling
is activated in SKBR3 xenografts exposed to RY10-4
alone. Interestingly, we found that the combination of
DAPT and RY10-4 in treatment helps reverse the induction
effects caused by treatment with RY10-4. Basal levels of
cleaved caspase-3 are low in SKBR3 tumor tissues and
remain low in DAPT-treated tumor tissues. However, we
saw a trend in increased induction by RY10-4 treatment,
and RY10-4 as a single agent was less effective in inducing
cleaved caspase-3 expression than the combination of
DAPT and RY10-4. These results suggest that aberrant
Notch activation by RY10-4 treatment impairs the antitumor effects of RY10-4. Further, combining a Notch
inhibitor with RY10-4 in treatment could help to improve
the anti-cancer effects of RY10-4.

DAPT and RY10-4 combination inhibits breast
tumor growth in vivo
From in vivo studies of the effects of treatment with
DAPT, RY10-4, combination of DAPT and RY10-4, or
vehicle (Figure 7A), we found no statistical difference
(P = 0.81 and 0.15, respectively) in tumor volume and
tumor weight between the DAPT group and the vehicle
control group. In contrast, treatment with RY10-4 (mean
tumor size 225 mm3, mean tumor weight 198 mg) and
treatment with a combination of DAPT and RY10-4
(mean tumor size 121 mm3, mean tumor weight 105 mg)
significantly inhibit SKBR3 tumor progression compared
to vehicle-treated animals (mean tumor size 375.3
mm3, mean tumor weight 363.4 mg Figure 7C, 7D).
Interestingly, we found that, in the combination group,
the tumors are whiter than the other groups (Figure 7B),
hinting that treatment with DAPT in combination with
RY10-4 disturbs angiogenesis in SKBR3 tumors. There
was no significant difference in mouse weight between

DISCUSSION
There are four subtypes of breast cancer based on the
expression of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), or HER2:
ER, PR+, HER2+; ER, PR+, HER2–; ER, PR–, HER2+;

cell lines we tested, the triple negative cell line MDAMB-231 and the ER+, PR+, HER2– cell line MCF-7
are very susceptible to RY10-4 as measured by MTT
and methylene blue methods. To our surprise, The ER–,
PR–, HER2+ cell line SKBR3 and ER+, PR+, HER2+
cell line BT474 are less sensitive. HER2 positive breast
cancer occurs in 25% of breast cancer patients, and
poor prognosis is due to activation of the PI3K/AKT
survival pathway [25]. Although two HER2-targeted
drugs (trastuzumab and lapatinib) have been approved
for clinical use by the FDA, most patients still relapse
after initially responding to treatment [26–28]. Activation
of Notch signaling is a common result of using HER2
inhibitors or a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, such as a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor [14, 15]. The Notch pathway,
an essential upstream regulator of HER2 signaling, is
positively correlated with drug resistance and has a tumorpromoting function in breast cancer [29]. Activation and
subsequent nuclear localization of the Notch intracellular

domain induces the transcription of the target HER2 gene,
which, in turn, activates the PI3K/AKT pathway [30].
Furthermore, other studies have confirmed that AKT
activation is necessary for Notch-conferred resistance to
apoptosis [23].
Since RY10-4 inhibits the HER2/PI3K/AKT axis,
we investigated whether Notch signaling contributes to
RY10-4-induced drug resistance in HER2-positive cells.
Our results demonstrate that treatment with RY10-4
increases expression of Notch ligands, activating Notch1ICD and targets by increasing both mRNA and protein
levels. The increased activity is abrogated by DAPT,
a Notch inhibitor. Importantly, cell proliferation is
inhibited more effectively by RY10-4 plus DAPT or
Notch1 siRNA than by either agent alone. RY10-4 at a
concentration of 0.5 μM alone was sufficient to decrease
cell growth by more than 50% in MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 cells, but only around 30% in HER2-amplified
SKBR3 and BT47 cells. This growth inhibition rises to

Our in vivo data also demonstrates the synergistic
effect of combinationtreatment, which decreases tumor
growth 20–30% more than compared to RY10-4 alone.
Furthermore, we found the decrease in cell proliferation is
due to a significant increase in apoptosis as RY10-4 plus
DAPT increases annexin V staining in SKBR3 cells and
induces cleaved-caspase3 expression in tumor tissue.
The mechanisms responsible for Notch-related drug
resistance are complex and still poorly understood. Some

However, we did not observe a synergistic effect between
DAPT and RY10-4 in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cell
lines. This suggests that the increased anti-proliferative
effects of DAPT when combined with RY10-4 are
specifically mediated by reversal of RY10-4-indued drug
resistance. In addition, we show that RY10-4 alone is
sufficient to inhibit AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 by
50%, which dramatically increases to 95% with DAPT.

studies have demonstrated that Notch signaling is involved
in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in drug resistant
cancer cells [31]. Other studies showed that abnormal
Notch signaling might contribute to carcinogenesis
by regulating the formation of cancer stem cells [32].
However, the mechanisms by which Notch signaling
regulates the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to RY10-4
are still under study.
Our results reveal that RY10-4 is a promising
drug candidate for the treatment of different types of
breast cancer. Cell proliferation of triple-negative and
ER-positive breast cancer is significantly inhibited upon
treatment with RY10-4. For HER2-positive cell lines, we
found that increased activation of Notch signaling upon
RY10-4 treatment can cause drug resistance. Combination
treatment with a Notch inhibitor increases the efficacy of
RY10-4 and prevents resistance. This work helps us gain
important insight into the molecular pathways involved
in the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to RY10-4, and
it allows us to rationally design successful combination
therapies for breast cancer treatment.

Exponentially growing cells (1 × 104) were plated
in a 48-well plate and treated with various concentrations
of RY10-4 dissolved in DMSO (giving a final DMSO
concentration of ≤ 0.1%) in media after 24 h growth.
Incubation was carried out at 37ºC for 24 h. Controls received
vehicle in DMSO at a concentration equal to that of RY104 treated cells. Media was removed, and cells were washed
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), air dried, stained with
0.3 ml methylene blue (2.5 g in 250 ml EtOH + 250 ml H2O),
left at room temperature for 2 h, and then washed with water.
To each well, 0.5 ml 1% Sarkosyl was added, and plates were
rotated at room temperature for 3 h. Transferring 150 μl to a
96-well plate allowed for determining the OD using a plate
reader at 595 nm. Cell viability assays were performed with
three independent experiments.

MTT cell proliferation assay
The effect of RY10-4 on breast cancer
cell proliferation was also assessed by using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
(MTT)bromide assay. Exponentially growing cells
(0.5 × 104) were plated in 96-well plates and treated with
concentrations of RY10-4 in media (giving a final DMSO
concentration of ≤ 0.1%) after 24 h of growth. Incubation
was carried out at 37ºC for 24 h. Controls received DMSO
vehicle at a concentration equal to that of drug-treated
cells. MTT solution was added to each well (2.5 mg/
ml) and incubated for 4 h. Supernatants were removed
from the wells, and the reduced MTT bromide dye was
solubilized in 200 μl/well DMSO. Absorbance at 570 nm
was determined on a plate reader.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
RY10-4 (Figure S1) was synthesized previously in
our laboratory [6], and the structure was confirmed by
NMR and MASS. Purity (95%) was measured by HPLC
analysis. RY10-4 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) to make a 10 μM stock solution, and this was
stored at –20ºC. The working dosage was freshly prepared
in basal medium with a final DMSO concentration of less
than 0.1%. The antibody against β-actin was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), and the antibodies against AKT, p-AKT, Notch1,
NICD, and HES1 were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). The antibody against
Dll4 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). All other chemicals
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Colony-formation assay
Breast cancer cell lines were plated on 6-well plates at
a density of 1 × 103 cells per well and treated with RY10-4
and/or DAPT. Media was changed after 24 h of incubation,
and colonies were observed over seven days. Colonies were
then stained with 0.5% of methylene blue in 50% ethanol
for 2 h. Quantification of colony formation was processed
using the “ColonyArea” plugin on ImageJ [34].

Collection. SKBR3 and BT474 human breast cancer
cells were kindly provided by Dr. Qin Yan (Department
of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine). They were
propagated in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained
at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Total cDNA was reversetranscribed from the total RNA with random hexamers
using the MultiScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase Kit
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Analysis of transcript
copy number relative to that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

with siNotch1 or control, a scrambled sequence, at a
concentration of 100 nM. After each treatment, cells were
incubated at 37ºC for 4 h followed by addition of fresh
culture media. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection
for protein analysis.

Luciferase reporter assays

Western blot analysis

The CSL (CBF1/RBP-J) luciferase reporter, (a gift
from Dr. Yungchi Cheng, Department of Pharmacology,
Yale School of Medicine), which contains a firefly
luciferase gene under the control of the multimerized CSL
responsive element upstream of the minimal promoter, was
transiently transfected into cells using the FuGene (Roche,
San Francisco, USA) transfection reagent. The pRL
plasmid, a vector that constitutively expresses the Renilla
luciferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus
promoter, was used as an internal control. Total DNA was
kept constant by adding empty vector as needed. After
transfection, cells were treated with RY10-4, DAPT, or
si-Notch1 for 6 hours. All transfections were carried out
in triplicate. The luciferase activity was measured with
the luciferase assay kit (Promrga, USA) and the Tecan
FARCyte luminometer (GE Healthcare, USA) according
to the manufacturers’ instructions.

Cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min
in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1% NP-40,
and 0.02% NaN3 with protease inhibitor (1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and, 1 μg/ml aprotinin)
to prevent proteolysis and dephosphorylation. After
centrifugation at 16099 g for 10 min, the supernatant
was harvested as the total cellular protein extract. Protein
concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). The total
cellular protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred to polyvinyldifluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5%
(w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (1 M Tris buffer saline,
pH 7.4, 5 M NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room
temperature and incubated overnight at 4ºC with primary
antibody. Blots were washed three times in TBST buffer,
followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with
the corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibodies.
Specific proteins were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Scientific, USA).

In vitro transfection of siRNA
Cells were transfected with siRNA using
Oligofectamine (Life Technologies, USA), performed
according to the supplier’s instructions. One day prior
to transfection, 2 × 105 cells per six-well plate were
seeded without antibiotics, corresponding to a density of
40%–50% at the time of transfection. Cells were treated

Annexin V labeling
Cells were incubated with RY10-4 and/or DAPT for
24 h. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS

and once with binding buffer (Abcam, USA). After adding
5 μl of Annexin V-PE to the media, cells were incubated
at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Analysis was
performed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus
IX71) with the filter set for rhodamine.

In vivo tumor xenograft study
Six-week-old female nude mice (BALB/c) were
inoculated subcutaneously at the right flank with 2 × 106
SKBR3 cells suspended in 0.2 ml PBS (pH 7.4). When
tumors reached an average diameter of 3 mm (usually in
seven days), the mice were randomized into 4 groups and
administered DAPT, RY10-4, combination of DAPT and
RY10-4, or vehicle. Each group consisted of five animals.
RY10-4 was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every
other day at 200 mg/kg, and DAPT was administered i.p.
every day at 100 mg/kg. The control group was given
vehicle (Figure 6A). Tumor size was measured using
calipers, and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated
according to a standard formula: width2 × length/2. Upon
termination of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed,
and the tumors were excised for weighing.

Immunohistochemistry
After treatment over 14 days, the mice were
sacrificed by euthanasia. The tissues were fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and
coated with wax. Tissue sections were sliced to 4 μm in
thickness and dyed with the primary antibody. Results
were captured by the Nikon TS100 microscope.
