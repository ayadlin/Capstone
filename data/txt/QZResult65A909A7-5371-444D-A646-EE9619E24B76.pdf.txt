Abstract
Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family member, is overexpressed in many types of human
cancer and associates with cell immortalization, malignant
transformation, and chemoresistance. Glycogen synthase
kinase-3B (GSK-3B), a key component of the Wnt signaling
pathway, is involved in multiple physiologic processes such
as protein synthesis, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. Here, we
report that expression of Mcl-1 was correlated with phosphorylated GSK-3B (p-GSK-3B) at Ser9 (an inactivated form
of GSK-3B) in multiple cancer cell lines and primary human
cancer samples. In addition, Mcl-1 was strikingly linked with
poor prognosis of human breast cancer, in which the high
level of Mcl-1 was related to high tumor grade and poor
survival of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, we found
that activation of GSK-3B could down-regulate Mcl-1 and was
required for proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation. Under
some physiologic conditions, such as UV irradiation, anticancer drug treatment, and inhibition of growth factor
pathways, Mcl-1 was down-regulated through activation of
GSK-3B. Our results indicate that Mcl-1 stabilization by GSK3B inactivation could be involved in tumorigenesis and serve
as a useful prognostic marker for human breast cancer.

Introduction
Apoptosis is critical for normal embryonic development, tissue
homeostasis, and cell functions. Deregulation of apoptosis
contributes to diverse human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorder and cancer (1). The antiapoptotic Bcl-2–like
proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and myeloid cell leukemia-1
(Mcl-1), which share three or four Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions
(BH1–BH4), are required for cell survival and have been found
to play key roles in the development of cancer due to their
role in controlling mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathways of
apoptosis (2, 3). Mcl-1, originally characterized in differentiating

myeloid cells, contains three BH domains (BH1–BH3) but lacks
a clearly defined BH4 domain at the NH2 terminus. Mcl-1 also
harbors a transmembrane domain at its COOH terminus, by
which Mcl-1 localizes to various intracellular membranes,
especially, the outer mitochondrial membrane (4). Similar to
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 can interact with Bax and/or Bak to
inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (5, 6). Compared with
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 is unique in that its expression is
quickly and readily induced after exposure to cytokines or
growth factors (7). Increased Mcl-1 expression may enhance cell
survival; that is, up-regulation of Mcl-1 not only promotes
viability in a wide range of cell types in the short term but also
contributes to immortalization and tumorigenesis in the long
term (8, 9). As Mcl-1 is often overexpressed and plays a role in
various human tumors; it may serve as a target for cancer
therapy (10, 11).
Glycogen synthase kinase-3h (GSK-3h), a serine/threonine
protein kinase involved in glycogen metabolism and the Wnt
signaling pathway, plays important roles in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. GSK-3h, through direct phosphorylation
of a broad range of substrates (translation factor eIF2B, cyclin
D1, c-Jun, c-myc, NFAT, cyclic AMP–responsive element binding
protein, Tau, and Snail), is an integral part of multiple
physiologic processes such as protein synthesis, microtubule
dynamics, cell proliferation and differentiation, and cell motility
(12, 13). GSK-3h activity can be abrogated by direct phosphorylation on the Ser9 residue by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/p90RSK, or
mammalian target of rapamycin/S6K upon a number of
extracellular stimuli, such as insulin, epidermal growth factor,
and fibroblast growth factor (13). Recent studies have shown that
overexpression of GSK-3h can induce apoptosis in several cell
types, whereas inactivation of GSK-3h through phosphorylation
of the Ser9 residue can reduce apoptosis (14, 15), indicating that
GSK-3h may play a critical role in linking multiple pathways to
regulate cellular apoptosis. In the current study, we found that
the activity of GSK-3h was required for proteasome-mediated
Mcl-1 degradation, and that Mcl-1 inversely correlated with GSK3h activity and associated with poor prognosis in human breast
cancer.

and J.R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). pHA-hMcl-1
was kindly provided by H-Y. Yan-Yen (Institute of Molecular Biology,
Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). The full-length hMcl-1 cDNA was
subcloned into vector pCMV5-MYC. Using the QuickChange multiple sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), kinase-dead GSK-3h (GSK-3h-KD;
pCGN-GSK-3h-KD) was generated according to the manufacturer’s protocol
and was further verified by automated sequencing. TDZD8, a GSK-3h
inhibitor, was purchased from Calbiochem. PD98059, an extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (Erk)/MAPK inhibitor, was purchased from Cell
Signaling. LY200294 (a PI3K/AKT inhibitor), MG132 (a proteasome
inhibitor), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and staurosporine were
purchased from Sigma.
Cell culture, UV and staurosporine treatment, and small interfering RNA transfection. Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB361, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-453-MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, SKBR3, and T47D;
ovarian cancer cell lines IP1, OVCAR3, and 2774; hepatoma cell lines
HepG2 and Hep3B; and pancreatic cancer cell CFPAC1 were bought from
the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in DMEM/F12
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient or stable
transfections with DNA were done with an optimal ratio of DNA to
liposome based on prior experiment (16). HeLa cells were plated at a
density of 3  106 in a 6-cm dish with DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum for 1 day, then treated with 1.9 J/m2/s of UV
irradiation for 2 min or with 0.1 Amol/L staurosporine at the indicated
time points. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, cells were
transfected with GSK-3h siRNA expression plasmid pKD-GSK-3h-v1
(Upstate Biotechnology) by electroporation (Solution T, program B-16)
using Nucleofector 1(Amaxa), and then lysates were harvested 48 h after
transfection.
Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and in vitro kinase assay.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were done as previously
described (17) with the following antibodies: Mcl-1 and GSK-3h (BD
Transduction Labs), p-GSK-3h (Ser9; Calbiochem and Cell Signaling
Technology), phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), Akt, phosphorylated h-catenin
(Ser33/37/Thr41; Cell Signaling Technology), and phosphorylated Erk and Erk
(Upstate Biotechnology). For in vitro kinase assays, purified GST-h-catenin
protein was incubated with GSK-3h immunocomplexes in the presence
of 50 mmol/L ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30jC. Reaction products
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then blotted with an anti–phosphorylated
h-catenin antibody. For quantification of the Western analysis, the density
of each band was quantified by Quantity One software; the background of
each selected area (band) was automatically calculated and then deducted
by the software.
Immunohistochemical staining. For immunohistochemical staining of
human breast cancer tissue samples, each sample was stained with specific
antibodies as indicated and scored by an H-score method that combines
the values of immunoreaction intensity and the percentage of tumor cell
staining. Briefly, the immunoreactivity of p-GSK-3h and Mcl-1 were ranked
into three groups according to the percentage of the positive tumor cells:
high (++, >25%), low (+, 1–25%), and negative ( , 0%). One hundred
twenty-four surgically resected human breast cancer specimens were
collected from the Department of Pathology, Shanghai East Breast Disease
Hospital, P.R. China. The clinical pathologic characteristics of specimens,
including tumor size, lymph node status, tumor grade, and levels of
estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, were obtained from medical
records. Tissue microarray slides (HistoArray IMH-302) were purchased
from IMGENEX.
Statistical analysis. The linear regression analysis was used to analyze
the correlation between p-GSK-3h expression and level of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and
Bcl-xL, respectively, in multiple cell lines. The m2 test was employed to
analyze the relation between Mcl-1 level with p-GSK-3h expression and the
stage of tumor grade in 125 primary breast cancer tissues. Kaplan-Meier
curves for the overall survival of 125 primary breast cancer patients were
plotted and compared. Log-rank test was used to evaluate the difference
between three levels of Mcl-1 expression with regard to overall survival.
Statistical analysis and graphs were done with SPSS software, and the level
of significance was set at 0.05.

Results
Level of Mcl-1 expression is related to phosphorylation of
GSK-3B at Ser9 in multiple cancer cell lines and primary
tumor samples. To investigate the mechanism of GSK-3h–
induced apoptosis, we searched for correlations between GSK-3h
activity and expression of the apoptosis-associated molecules
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Because phosphorylation of Ser9 is
known to inactivate GSK-3h kinase activity and can be used as
a measurement of GSK-3h inactivation (18), we compared
expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 with GSK-3h phosphorylation level at Ser9. We found that Ser9 phosphorylation of
GSK-3h was significantly correlated with Mcl-1 expression in a
panel of 11 cancer cell lines of breast, ovary, and pancreas;
however, there is no statistically significant correlation between
the level of GSK-3h phosphorylation at Ser9 and the expression
of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (Fig. 1A). To further test whether the
correlation between p-GSK-3h (Ser9) and Mcl-1 expression in
cell culture is a general phenomenon in multiple tumor types,
we examined 21 human tumor specimens from tumor tissue
microarray using immunohistochemical analysis. GSK-3h phosphorylation at Ser9 was correlated with Mcl-1 expression in 18
of the 21 tumor specimens (Fig. 1B), indicating that the
relationship between Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3h and Mcl-1
expression is a general phenomenon in multiple types of human
cancer.
Mcl-1 expression associates with poor survival in human
breast cancer. To justify pathologic relevance of the relationship
between p-GSK-3h (Ser9) and Mcl-1 expression observed in
cancer cell lines, we analyzed these two proteins in 125 human
breast cancer tissue samples. Consistently, immunohistochemical
stainings showed that there is a positive correlation between the
levels of Mcl-1 and p-GSK-3h in human breast cancer samples
(P = 0.025; Fig. 2A and B). Next, we analyzed expression level of
Mcl-1 and clinical-pathologic characteristics of 125 breast cancer
samples: age, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, tumor grade,
and expression of estrogen receptor. We found that a high level
of Mcl-1 was strikingly correlated with high tumor grade,
whereas negative/low expression of Mcl-1 was correlated with
low tumor grade (Fig. 2B). We then compared the Mcl-1
expression in tumor tissues with the patients’ survival followup. The results suggested that the patients’ survival is decreased
significantly with the increasing expression of Mcl-1 (Fig. 2C),
indicating that the expression level of Mcl-1 could be a potential
candidate as a predictive marker of poor prognosis in breast
cancer patients.
GSK-3B kinase activity is required for proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation. The positive correlation between Ser9phosphorylated GSK-3h and Mcl-1 up-regulation suggested that
there is an inverse correlation between GSK-3h activity and Mcl1 expression, which prompted us to test whether activation of
GSK-3h could inhibit the expression of Mcl-1. A wild-type GSK3h (GSK-3h-WT), GSK-3h-CA, or GSK-3h-KD was cotransfected
with Mcl-1 to 293 T cells for 48 h. The expression level of Mcl-1
was much lower in the presence of GSK-3h-CA or GSK-3h-WT
than in the presence of GSK-3h-KD (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2
versus lane 3). In addition, the proteasome inhibitor MG132
blocked GSK-3h-WT– or GSK-3h-CA–induced down-regulation of
Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 1 and 2), suggesting
that proteasome-mediated degradation is involved in active GSK3h–induced Mcl-1 down-regulation. We then tested whether

endogenous Mcl-1 was increased in human cancer cell lines
treated with GSK-3h inhibitors lithium or TDZD8 or the

Figure 3. GSK-3h associates with Mcl-1, and its kinase activity is required for proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation. A, 293T cells transfected with Myc-Mcl-1
and HA-GSK-3h-WT, GSK-3h-CA, or GSK-3h-KD were treated with or without the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 Amol/L) for 10 h and then analyzed by
Western blotting with antibodies against Myc-Mcl-1 and HA-GSK-3h, respectively. The data were consistent with Fig. 1E in our recent publication in Molecular
and Cellular Biology (24). B, human cancer cell lines were treated with GSK-3h inhibitors LiCi (20 mmol/L), TDZD (4 Amol/L) or the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(10 Amol/L) for 10 h, respectively, and then cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting to detect endogenous Mcl-1. C, HA-tagged GSK-3h and Myc-tagged
Mcl-1 were cotransfected into 293T cells, and GSK-3h and Mcl-1 were immunoprecipitated from cotransfected 293T cell lysates, respectively, and then subjected
to Western blotting. D, endogenous GSK-3h and Mcl-1 were immunoprecipitated from the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453, respectively, and then subjected
to Western blotting.

GSK-3h could interact with Mcl-1. The hemagglutinin-tagged
GSK-3h was transfected into 293T cells, and then GSK-3h and
Mcl-1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. The association between GSK-3h and Mcl-1 was clearly detected by Western
blotting (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we also detected in vivo
association of endogenous GSK-3h and Mcl-1 in MDA-MB-453,
a breast cancer cell line (Fig. 3D), whereas under the same
conditions, we did not detect any association between GSK-3h
and two other Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (data not
shown).
UV irradiation, staurosporine, or inhibition of growth
factor pathways down-regulates Mcl-1 through activating
GSK-3B. To investigate whether GSK-3h–mediated down-regulation of Mcl-1 occurs under other physiologic and pathologic
conditions, two cancer cell lines (Hep3B, a hepatoma cell line
and MDA-MB-231, a breast cancer cell line) were treated with

IGF-1, which is known to inhibit GSK-3h activity through
activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk/MAPK pathways (18, 19).
After IGF-1 treatment in both cell lines, we observed that Mcl-1
was stabilized, and GSK-3h was inactivated via phosphorylation
of Ser9 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, once GSK-3h activity was
recovered after cells were treated with the PI3K/AKT inhibitor
LY200294 and the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, which indicated by
reduced Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3h, the expression level of
Mcl-1 was down-regulated (Fig. 4A). These findings provided
further evidence that Mcl-1 expression depends on the activity
of GSK-3h. It is known that UV irradiation and certain
anticancer drugs can down-regulate Mcl-1, but the underlying
mechanism is yet to be clear. We investigated whether GSK-3h
plays a role in down-regulating Mcl-1 under these conditions;
HeLa cells were treated with UV irradiation or the anticancer
drug, staurosporine, which can induce apoptosis (20). Following

these treatments, the level of p-GSK-3h was reduced (Fig. 4B);
concurrently, the Mcl-1 level was decreased, indicating that UV
and staurosporine could stimulate GSK-3h activity and downregulate Mcl-1. We then investigated whether the activity of

GSK-3h is required for UV- or staurosporine-induced Mcl-1
down-regulation. We showed that both Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3h and expression of Mcl-1 were increased in LiCl-pretreated
cells upon treatment with UV or staurosporine (Fig. 4C).

Figure 4. UV irradiation, staurosporine, or inhibition of growth factor pathway down-regulates Mcl-1 through activating GSK-3h. A, Hep3B and MDA-MB-231 (231)
cells were pretreated with the Erk/MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (PD ; 20 Amol/L) and/or the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY200294 (LY ; 2 Amol/L) before treatment with IGF-1
(40 ng/mL). The expression of Mcl-1 and the phosphorylation levels of GSK-3h, Erk (p-Erk ), and Akt (p-Akt ) were examined by Western blotting. B, HeLa cells were
treated with UV or staurosporine at several time points (2, 4, 6, and 8 h). The Ser9-phosphorylated status of GSK-3h and Mcl-1 expression levels were determined
in cell lysates by Western blotting, and then the densities of Mcl-1 and p-GSK-3h (Ser9) were quantified by software Quantity One. p-GSK-3h and Mcl-1 were
normalized by GSK-3h, respectively, then the result of each time point will be compared with the time point without treatment in each group (the result of without
treatment was treated as 100%). The experiments were triplicated. Results were included with error bars. C, HeLa cells were pretreated with the GSK-3h inhibitor LiCl
(40 mmol/L) before stimulation with UV or staurosporine for 6 h, then the Ser9-phosphorylated status of GSK-3h and Mcl-1 expression levels were determined in
cell lysates by Western blotting. D, cells were transfected with GSK-3h siRNA or nontargeting control siRNA (Dharmacon) for 48 h followed by treatment of UV
irradiation or staurosporine for 6 h, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting to detect Ser9-phosphorylated status of GSK-3h and Mcl-1 expression level.

Furthermore, GSK-3h siRNA also blocked UV- or staurosporineinduced Mcl-1 turnover (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these findings
indicate that inactivation of growth factor pathways, UV
irradiation, and staurosporine can down-regulate Mcl-1 through
activation of GSK-3h.

Discussion
It is well documented that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, play critical roles
in the development of human cancers. Transformation of T
lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and mammary epithelial cells were
observed in Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL transgenic mice(21, 22). Mcl-1 also
plays an important role in embryonic development and in
apoptotic control, resulting in long-term immortalization and
tumorigenesis. However, following a wide range of environmental
stimuli, the expression patterns of Mcl-1 and other members of
the Bcl-2 family are significantly different (7). The underlying
mechanism contributing to the different expression patterns
among Bcl-2 family members remains elusive. In the current
study, we found that Ser9-phosphorylated GSK-3h, as an inactive
form of GSK-3h, was correlated with up-regulation of Mcl-1, but
not with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in multiple tumor cell lines and primary
human cancer samples. Furthermore, GSK-3h physically interacted with Mcl-1, but not with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Our results may
explain the differential expression of Mcl-1 and other members
of Bcl-2 family following a wide range of environmental stimuli
(7). In addition, we found that high level expression of Mcl-1 was
linked to high tumor grade and poor survival in breast cancer
patients, and that no or low level expression of Mcl-1 was
correlated with low tumor grade and good survival. These results
suggest that up-regulation of Mcl-1 plays an important role in
development of breast cancer; and high-level expression of Mcl-1
could be used as a predictive marker for poor prognosis of
breast cancer patients.
GSK-3h is a key regulator of numerous signaling pathways
such as the Wnt/h-catenin, growth factor, and receptor tyrosine
kinase pathways. Recently, several studies indicate that GSK-3h–
induced apoptosis is related to the mitochondrial-dependent

intrinsic caspase pathway. In the current study, we found that
GSK-3h down-regulates Mcl-1, and that its kinase activity is
required for proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation, indicating
that activation of GSK-3h may facilitate cell apoptosis through
inhibiting Mcl-1. Our observation is consistent with a newly
published report stating that GSK-3h phosphorylates Mcl-1,
resulting in destabilization of Mcl-1 (23). It is well known that
Mcl-1 protein is tightly regulated and subjected to rapid
degradation when cells undergo apoptosis in response to various
stimuli, such as withdrawal of growth factor, ionizing radiation,
and DNA-damaging reagents. Here, we show that these
pathophysiologic conditions, such as UV and anticancer drug
treatment, activate GSK-3h, causing degradation of Mcl-1.
Importantly, it is well documented that Mcl-1 is overexpressed
and significantly contributes to chemoresistance in various
human malignancies such as leukemia, melanoma, pancreatic
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and others. Chemoresistance,
which may be caused by highly expressed receptor tyrosine
kinase Her2 and other growth factors in breast cancer, is one of
the major obstacles in treating breast cancer patients. The
current study provides a plausible mechanism that Her2 and
growth factors may inactivate GSK-3h through the PI3K/AKT
and MAPK pathways and then stabilize Mcl-1 (11), resulting in
chemoresistance in breast cancer. Further studied are required
for elucidating whether activation of GSK-3h may lead to
chemosensitization of breast cancer cells through down-regulation of Mcl-1, which may provide a novel approach for breast
cancer treatment.
