BACKGROUND. Substantial evidence supports a direct role of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in the development and maintenance of human tumors. Although
antisense oligonucleotide therapy targeting various genes are useful for cancer
treatment, 1 of the major limitations is the problem of delivery. A novel antisense
oligonucleotide delivery method is described that allows prolonged sustainment
and release of ODC antisense oligonucleotides in vivo using atelocollagen.

METHODS. The effect of ODC antisense oligonucleotides in the atelocollagen on
cell growth of gastrointestinal cancer (MKN 45 and COLO201) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) was studied in vitro using a cell-counting method with a hemocytometer. In vivo, the effect of intratumoral, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal

CONCLUSIONS. As various human cancers significantly express ODC, the results
strongly suggest that this new antisense method may be of considerable value for
treatment of human cancers. Cancer 2007;109:993–1002.

olyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are essential
for cell growth and differentiation.1–5 The metabolism of polyamines begins with the decarboxylation of ornithine to form putrescine regulated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC).1–5 Increased ODC
activity and polyamine levels in various human tumors have been
documented.1–10 Several groups including ours reported that ODC
overexpression in mouse fibroblasts induced cell transformation,11–14
and the ODC gene is now considered a protooncogene. Antisense
oligonucleotides including small interfering RNA, which act by
specifically hybridizing with complementary RNA sequences, can
inhibit protein expression.15–18 Modified analogs, particularly phosphorothioate, have been used to specifically inhibit gene expression
both in vitro and in vivo.19–22 Recent clinical studies have tested
antisense compounds directed against cancer-related genes such
as p53, bcl-2, c-raf, H-ras, protein kinase C-alpha, and protein

has been modest and clinical activity has not been
remarkable. Continuous infusion may be necessary to
achieve sufficient and sustained delivery of antisense
oligonucleotides to the tumor.
Recently, the authors of the present study reported that HST-1/FGF-4 plasmid DNA embedded in
the atelocollagen was protected from nuclease attack
and sustained in peripheral blood for as long as
40 days after injection of plasmid DNA embedded in
the atelocollagen in vivo.25 We next reported that a
phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides
of midkine embedded in atelocollagen suppressed
CMT-93 mouse rectal carcinoma cell growth.26 In this
study we extended these studies for elucidating the
potential of antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (ODNs) embedded in the atelocollagen, targeted
against ODC on the growth of human gastrointestinal
tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft inoculated
in nude mice. Here we demonstrate that a single
administration of ODC antisense ODNs embedded
in the atelocollagen remarkably suppressed human
tumor growth over a 35–42 day period.

results were obtained. Thus, we show the results obtained by the cell-counting method using a hemocytometer in the Results. The efficiency of transfection
was evaluated using 10 lM FITC-labeled ODC
antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen (0.018%). The
percentage of positive cells at 8 and 20 hours in
MKN45, COLO201, and RD cells was (47.0  8.2,
59.6  3.7), (58.3  8.6, 62.0  5.8), and (25.4  4.6,
38.7  4.6), respectively.

Measurement of ODC Activities
ODC activities were determined in triplicate using
DL-[l-14C]-ornithine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Buckinghamshire, UK) as a substrate.12 The protein
concentration was measured using a Bradford assay
kit (Bio-Rad, Tokyo).
Measurement of Polyamine Levels by High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography
The contents of polyamines were measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography28 and are
expressed as percent compared with control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Biomaterials
Antigenic telopeptides attached to both ends of the
collagen molecules are eliminated by pepsin treatment, resulting in the formation of atelocollagen.25
Oligonucleotides
The oligonucleotides (ODNs) used were phosphorothioate ones. The sequences for ODC antisense
ODNs (targeting the human ODC translation initiation region, 319–338, NM 002539) and scrambled
ODNs were 50 TCA TGA TTT CTT GAT GTT CC 30 and
50 CCT TGT AGT TCT TTA GTA CT 30 , respectively.27
Treatment of Cells in Culture With Antisense
Oligonucleotides
MKN45 (gastric cancer) and COLO201 (colon cancer)
cells were cultured in RPMI and RD (rhabdomyosarcoma) cells in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf
serum (Health Science Research Resource Bank,
Osaka, Japan). Five 3 105 cells/500 lL media per
well were treated with 10 lM antisense ODNs in the
atelocollagen (0.018%), 10 lM scrambled ODNs in
the atelocollagen, 10 lM scrambled ODNs, 10 lM
antisense ODNs, 0.018% atelocollagen, and 10 lM
antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen (0.018%) þ

Tokyo) and a cell-counting method using a hemocy-

Measurement of Antitumor Effects of ODC Antisense
ODNs in Nude Mouse Tumor Models
This study was approved by a DNA committee,
Faculty of Medicine, the University of Tokyo, and all
procedures involving animal care were in accord
with institutional guidelines in compliance with
national laws. Male BALB/c Slc-nu nude mice (4–
5 weeks old, 16–20 g; SLC, Hamamatsu City, Japan)
were anesthetized with ethylether and inoculated
subcutaneously with 5 3 107 MKN45, COLO201, and
RD cells on the back. After about 7 days (6–8 days)
when palpable tumors reached approximately
200 mg the treatment was started. The weights were
calculated by the formula l 3 w2/2 [length (l), and
width (w)]. One hundred lL of saline solution containing ODC antisense ODNs or scrambled ODNs
(500 lg) embedded in the atelocollagen (1.8%) was
directly injected into tumor or intraperitoneally (i.p.)
or intramuscularly (i.m.) on the back of mice.
To clarify the difference of efficiency of liposome
and atelocollagen, we compared the effect of treatment of liposome (Transfast) þ AS ODC via local injection and that of atelocollagen þ AS ODC via local
injection on RD tumor growth. The liposome called
Transfast was purchased from Promega (Madison,
WI). It is composed of N,N’bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-Nmethyl-N-[2,3-di (tetradecanoyloxy) propyl] ammonium iodido and neutral lipid (DOPE).

Histological Study
At 35 (MKN45 and COLO201) and 42 (RD) days after
treatment, tumor tissues were removed and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin or with the Azan method.
FITC-labeled ODC antisense ODNs with and without
atelocollagen were administered i.p. in RD tumorbearing mice and the intensity of fluorescence was
compared.
Statistical Analysis
The significance was determined by analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher PSLD test
or by Scheffe test (indicated with an asterisk). All
P-values were 2-sided.

RESULTS
Effects of ODC Antisense ODNs on Cell Growth In Vitro
MKN45, COLO201, and RD cells with the highest
ODC activities were selected. In dose-response experiments (0–25 lM), 10 lM antisense ODNs in the
atelocollagen (0.018%) were the most effective in RD
cell growth in vitro (data not shown). Antisense
ODNs in the atelocollagen markedly suppressed
MKN45, COLO201, and RD cell growth (Fig. 1), 83.8%
(P < .0001), 86.5% (P < .0001), and 95.6% (P < .0001),
respectively. Scrambled ODNs had no significant inhibitory effect on MKN45 and COLO201 cell growth

(P ¼ .6281 and P ¼ .4137, respectively). Atelocollagen
inhibited MKN45, COLO201, and RD cell growth
26.8% (P ¼ .0027), 35.4% (P ¼ .0001), and 54.2% (P
< .0001), respectively. Scrambled ODNs in the atelocollagen also inhibited cell growth 32.3% (P ¼ .0006),
38.0% (P < .0001), and 59.9% (P < .0001), respectively,
which was considered to be the effect of atelocollagen. Antisense ODNs also inhibited cell growth 56.1%
(P < .0001), 29.7% (P ¼ .0006), and 69.1% (P < .0001),
respectively. The effect was smaller than antisense
ODNs in the atelocollagen (P ¼ .0140, P < .0001, and
P ¼ .0011). The specificity of growth inhibitory effect
of antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen was shown
by the following results. Twenty lM putrescine completely blocked the inhibitory effect induced by
antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen on MKN45 cell
growth (P ¼ .3014) (Fig. 1A), and rescued the inhibitory effect on COLO201 and RD cell growth up to
87%, and 78%, respectively (Fig. 1B,C). Although the
inhibitory effect of atelocollagen was unexpected, it
seems to be beneficial for ODC antisense therapy
with atelocollagen.

Cell Viability by Trypan Blue Method
The viability of MKN45, COLO201, and RD cells at
6 days was 56.0  5.3% (P < .0001), 57.8  9.2% (P
< .0001), and 42.1  10.3% (P < .0001), respectively.

in the atelocollagen.

Effects of ODC Antisense ODNs on ODC Activities
and Polyamine Levels
At 6 days antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen suppressed ODC activities in MKN45, COLO201, and RD
cells, 93.3% (P < .0001), 90.5% (P < .0001), and 86.4%
(P < .0001), respectively (Fig. 2). Although scrambled
ODNs had no significant inhibitory effect on ODC
activities (P ¼ .3365, P ¼ .8919, and P ¼ .2941), atelocollagen inhibited ODC activities in 3 cells, 41.3% (P
< .0001), 37.2% (P ¼ .0003), and 54.5% (P < .0001),
respectively. Scrambled ODNs in the atelocollagen
also inhibited ODC activities, 48.0% (P < .0001),
34.0% (P ¼ .0006), and 54.5% (P < .0001), respectively,
which was considered to be the effect of atelocollagen. Antisense ODNs also inhibited ODC activities,
62.7% (P < .0001), 54.3% (P < .0001), and 50.0% (P
< .0001), respectively. But the effect of antisense
ODNs on ODC activities was less than that of antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen (P ¼ .0004, 0.0017,
and 0.0007, respectively). Suppression of ODC activities was almost completely blocked by 20lM putrescine (Fig. 2) (P ¼ .8451, P ¼ .0731, and P ¼ .0468,
respectively), indicating the specificity of ODC antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen. At 6 days, antisense

ODNs in the atelocollagen suppressed putrescine
and spermidine contents in MKN45, COLO201, and
RD cells [95.3  4.1% (P < .0001), 53.1  9.3%
(P ¼ .0008) (n ¼ 3)], [88.7  9.1% (P < .0001),
73.3  13.3% (P ¼ .0002) (n ¼ 3)], and [76.2  2.2%
(P < .0001), 45.6  16.7% (P ¼ .0036) (n ¼ 3)], respectively. Spermine contents remained unchanged or
slightly decreased.

Antitumor Effects of ODC Antisense ODNs In Vivo
Antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen remarkably
suppressed tumor growth over a 35–42 day period
(Fig. 3). At 35 days MKN45 tumor growth with antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen was almost completely suppressed (Fig. 3A). The size was 0.2% (P <
.001*) compared with nontreated control. Tumor
growth treated with the atelocollagen and scrambled
ODNs þ atelocollagen was also significantly suppressed and the size was 34.9% (P < .0001*) and
41.0% (P < .0001*), respectively. This effect was considered to be the effect of atelocollagen. At 35 days
COLO201 tumor growth with antisense ODNs in the
atelocollagen was remarkably suppressed and the
size was 3.7% (P < .0001*) (Fig. 3B). Atelocollagen
suppressed COLO201 tumor growth and the size was
9.5% (P < .0001*). At 42 days RD tumor with the antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen was remarkably
suppressed and the size was 13.7% (P < .0001*)

the size was 44.2% (P < .0001*). The effect was less
than that with antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen
(P < .0001*). We next compared the effect of antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen with antisense
ODNs in liposome (TransFast). Antisense ODNs in
liposome suppressed RD tumor 38.5% (P < .0001*),
but the effect was smaller than that of antisense
ODNs in the atelocollagen (P < .0001*) (Fig. 3C).

Comparison of Effects of Antisense ODNs on Tumor
Growth via Different Administration Routes
Administration of antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen via i.m. and i.p. injection remarkably suppressed
RD tumor (Fig. 3C). Intraperitoneal administration of
antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen was the most
effective on RD tumor suppression. The size of tumor
42 days after administration of antisense ODNs in
the atelocollagen via i.m., i.p., and intratumoral (i.t.)
injection was 19.9% (P < .0001*), 3.5% (P < .0001*),
and 13.7% (P < .0001*), respectively (Fig. 3C). At 35
days after i.p. injection the growth of MKN45 and

COLO201 was almost completely suppressed. The
size was 0.7% (P < .0001*) and 3.5% (P < .0001*),
respectively (Fig. 3A,B).

Effects of ODC Antisense ODNs on ODC Activities
and Polyamine Levels In Vivo
Intratumoral administration of ODC antisense ODNs
in the atelocollagen significantly suppressed ODC
activities in MKN45, COLO201, and RD tumors
87.8% (n ¼ 10, P < .0001*), 64.9% (n ¼ 8, P < .0001*),
71.3% (n ¼ 6, P < .0001*), respectively (Fig. 4). Atelocollagen (n ¼ 10) inhibited ODC activities in 3
tumors (Fig. 4A-C), but the effect was less than that
of antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen (P < .0001*, P
¼ .0006*, and P < .0001*, respectively). Scrambled
ODNs in the atelocollagen (n ¼ 10) slightly inhibited
ODC activities in MKN45 cells (Fig. 4A), but its effect
was less than antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen (P
< .0001*, n ¼ 10). ODC antisense ODNs in liposome
(TransFast) (n ¼ 5) also inhibited ODC activities in
RD cells (Fig. 4C), but its effect was less than antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen (P < .0001*) (n ¼ 10).

Histologic Analysis
Effects of a single i.t. administration of antisense
ODNs in the atelocollagen on tumor tissue and other

organs were analyzed histologically under a microscope. At 35 (MKN45 and COLO201) and 42 (RD)
days after treatment tumor tissues were removed and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Collagen was
stained with the Azan method. Typical examples in
MKN45, COLO201, and RD tumor tissues are shown
in Figure 5. Histological examination (H&E stain)
showed marked necrosis, surrounded by a small
number of living cancer cells, indicating that administration of antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen
induced necrosis. Tumor tissues stained by the Azan
method showed a marked proliferation of fibrous tissue and collagenous fiber. Control tumor tissues
showed a marked proliferation of cancer cells (H&E),
surrounded by a slight or modest proliferation of fibrous tissue. We purified genomic DNAs from tumor
tissues treated with antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen. A DNA ladder was not detected (data not
shown). In other organs examined no abnormal
macroscopic and histologic changes were observed
(not shown), indicating that antisense ODNs in the
atelocollagen gave no apparent toxicity in other
organs.

the atelocollagen (1.8%) or FITC-labeled antisense
ODNs were administered i.p. in RD tumor (about
200 mg)-bearing nude mice. After 3 days the tumor
was removed and observed under a fluorescent
microscope. Fluorescence was clearly detected in the
tumor (Fig. 6). The intensity of the fluorescence was
quantified. The intensity in tumor administered with
FITC-labeled antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen
was 3.1  0.6-fold (P < .005) compared with that in
tumor administered with FITC-labeled antisense
ODNs. The data indicate a pivotal role of atelocollagen in protecting ODNs from nuclease attack.

DISCUSSION
We have shown that administration of ODC antisense
ODNs in the atelocollagen markedly suppressed the
growth of human stomach, colon, and rhabdomyosarcoma tumor in vitro and in vivo. A striking point
in this study is that a single administration of ODC
antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen via i.t., i.p. and
i.m. routes had remarkable tumor suppressive effects

for at least 35–42 days. Atelocollagen played a pivotal
role in achieving this effect by preventing nuclease
access to ODNs, as we observed in our previous study
in a case of plasmid DNA in the atelocollagen.25,26 A
single injection of ODC antisense ODNs embedded
in the atelocollagen allowed continuous suppression
of tumor growth, ODC activities, and polyamine levels
for at least 35–42 days without additional administration of ODC antisense ODNs. This indicates that
ODC antisense ODNs embedded in the atelocollagen
remained intact for 35–42 days in vivo and seemed
to be released gradually. Atelocollagen is useful to
avoid rapid degradation of ODC antisense ODNs
in vivo. Inhibition of cell and tumor growth by ODC
antisense ODNs in the atelocollagen was associated
with decreased ODC activities and polyamine levels,
especially with decreased levels of putrescine in cells
or tumor. The results are consistent with those shown
in difluoromethylornithine (synthetic inhibitor of
ODC)-induced tumor suppression and cell death.29–32
One of the major limitations for the therapeutic
use of antisense ODNs is the problem of deliv-

FIGURE 6. Detection of fluorescence in tumors after intraperitoneal administration of FITC-labeled ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antisense oligonucleotides
(ODNs). FITC-labeled antisense ODNs (AS) (500 lg) with and without atelocollagen (1.8%) were administered intraperitoneally in RD tumor (around 200 mg in
size)-bearing nude mice. On 3 day after administration tumors were removed and sections were cut. Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescent microscope. The intensity of fluorescence with (FITC-AS þ atelocollagen) and without atelocollagen (FITC-AS) was compared. Corresponding hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained photos are shown in the right panel. Magnification, 3200.

ery.21,22,33–35 Many classes of compounds have been
used as delivery vehicles including cationic liposomes.33,35 Relatively high cytotoxic properties of cationic liposomes may restrict their use in in vivo
experiments. We compared our system with the commercially available cationic liposome (TransFast).
ODC antisense ODNs in TransFast suppressed RD
tumor growth, but it was less effective than our system. There are reports that describe in vivo efficacy
with antisense ODNs targeted against various genes

such as c-raf-1 kinase, c-myc, and protein kinase
A,21,22 but repeated administration of antisense ODNs
is necessary to obtain sufficient tumor-suppressive
effects. Daily i.v. injection of antisense phosphorothioate c-raf-1 kinase oligonucleotides (up to 6 mg/kg)
was necessary to inhibit tumor growth efficiently,36
and clinical responses were observed only in 3 of
17 ovarian cancer.37 Antisense ODNs directed against
PKC-alpha has been tested in some human tumor
cell lines grown in athymic mice.38 Administration of

Antisense Therapy Suppresses CA Growth/Nakazawa et al.

ODNs, once a day for 14 days, was necessary to
obtain a noticeable tumor suppressive effects with a
50% inhibitory dose between 60 and 600 lg/kg per
day. This ODN entered a Phase I clinical trial.39,40
The effect of antisense ODNs targeted to the c-myc
oncogene was tested on the growth of human melanoma xenografts.41 One mg per mouse per day, i.v.,
daily for 8-day antisense treatment inhibited tumor
growth. A single-injection (50 mg/kg) protein kinase
A-directed antisense ODN treatment inhibited colon
tumor growth.42 Several Phase I/II trials using antisense ODNs have been reported, but the effect was
modest.43–47
Bcl-2-specific antisense oligonucleotides have
shown broad anticancer activities in preclinical models and are currently in several Phase III trials.48,49
Our system also seems to be more applicable for
clinical use as a single administration of ODC antisense ODNs-induced maximum tumor-suppressive
effects over a period of 35–42 days without any
noticeable toxic effects in other organs.
In summary, ODC antisense ODN therapy using
atelocollagen as a carrier had a remarkable growthsuppressive effect on human stomach, colon, and
rhabdomyosarcoma tumor. As a single administration of ODC antisense ODNs had a continuous
tumor suppressive effect and various human cancers
express higher levels of ODC, this novel method of
targeting against ODC expression may be of considerable value for clinical applications.
