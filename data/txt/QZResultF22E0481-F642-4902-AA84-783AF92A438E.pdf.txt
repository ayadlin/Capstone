Abstract
Down-regulation of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein) sensitizes colon cancer cells to the anticancer effect
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-; (PPAR;)
ligands in mice. The aims of this study were to evaluate the
effect of embelin (2,5-dihydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-benzoquinone),
an antagonist of XIAP, on colon cancer, with a particular focus
on whether PPAR; is required for embelin to exert its effect.
A dominant-negative PPAR; was used to antagonize endogenous PPAR; in HCT116 cells. Cells were treated with or
without embelin. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and nuclear
factor-KB (NF-KB) activity were measured. For in vivo studies,
1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) was s.c.
injected to induce colon cancer in PPAR;+/+ and PPAR;+/
mice. Mice were fed embelin daily for 10 days before DMH
injection, and continued for 30 more weeks. Embelin inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells with
marked up-regulation of PPAR;. In addition, embelin significantly inhibited the expressions of survivin, cyclin D1, and
c-Myc. These effects were partially dependent on PPAR;.
PPAR;+/ mice were more susceptible to DMH-induced colon
carcinogenesis than PPAR;+/+ mice, and embelin significantly
reduced the incidence of colon cancer in PPAR;+/+ mice but
not in PPAR;+/ mice. Embelin inhibited NF-KB activity in
PPAR;+/+ mice but marginally so in PPAR;+/ mice. Thus,
reduced expression of PPAR; significantly sensitizes colonic
tissues to the carcinogenic effect of DMH. Embelin inhibits
chemical carcinogen-induced colon carcinogenesis, but this
effect is partially dependent on the presence of functional
PPAR;, indicating that PPAR; is a necessary signaling
pathway involved in the antitumor activity of normal
organisms. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4776–83]

Materials and Methods

Introduction
We have recently observed that down-regulation of XIAP
(X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) coupled with peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARg) ligands could synergistically induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells, and such an approach
could significantly suppress the growth of colon cancer in mice
(1–3). Indeed, XIAP plays a critical role in the resistance of many
cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (4, 5). Thus, direct
inhibition of XIAP may be a promising strategy for the

development of novel anticancer agents. Small-molecule inhibitors
of XIAP have been tested in many in vitro experiments (6, 7).
Embelin (2,5-dihydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-benzoquinone) is a
potent, nonpeptidic, cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor of
XIAP that targets the XIAP BIR3 domain (6). Embelin prevents
the development of chemical carcinogen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats (8, 9). The combination of embelin with recombinant
human tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
could synergistically induce cell death in pancreatic cancer (5).
Although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown,
recent studies have indicated that embelin functions as a strong
antioxidant (10) and a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
in several human cancer cell lines (11). Embelin was found to downregulate NF-nB–dependent genes involved in tumor cell survival,
proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis, making this agent
potentially useful for cancer therapy (11).
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARg) is a
nuclear receptor that acts as a transcription factor. Ligand-induced
activation of PPARg led to the transcription of downstream target
genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in
several malignant cell lines, thus, PPARg plays a crucial role in
carcinogenesis (12, 13). Previous studies indicate that activation of
PPARg inhibits growth and induces differentiation and apoptosis
of colon cancer cells (14, 15), and that PPARg ligands suppress
colon carcinogenesis in vivo (16). Recent studies have shown that
activation of PPARg inhibits multiple steps in the NF-nB signaling
pathway, and such an interaction contributes significantly to the
antitumor effects of PPARg (17, 18).
In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether embelin
has any anticancer effects in colon cancer, and if so, what are the
molecular mechanisms. We focused particularly on whether PPARg
plays any role in the antitumor effect of embelin.

with the indicated concentrations of embelin for 12 h, followed by
incubation with or without 1 ng/mL of TNF-a for an additional 24 h.
Luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega), as we previously reported (2).
Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot.
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was performed as we
described (21). The results were normalized to the expression of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and expressed as the mean F
SD. Primers used for human PPARg detection were forward, 5¶GGTGGCCATCCGCATCT-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TGCTTTTGGCATACTCTGTGATCT-3¶. Western blot was performed as we described (1, 2).
Animals and genotyping. All animal experiments were performed
according to protocols approved by the Committee on the Use of Live
Animals in Teaching and Research of the University of Hong Kong. PPARg
heterozygous mice (PPARg+/ mice) were kind gifts from Dr. Frank
Gonzalez (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; ref. 22). PPARg+/ mice
were mated with wild-type C57 mice to produce offspring. Genomic DNA
extracted from the ear of each mouse was used to do genotyping by PCR
as previously described (22). Both PPARg+/+ and PPARg+/ mice used in the
experiments were littermates with similar genetic backgrounds.
Induction of tumors by DMH and treatment of mice with embelin.
Administration of DMH was performed as described previously (23). A total
of 59 mice, ages 8 to 12 weeks, were randomly divided into four groups, as
detailed in Table 1. Each group consisted of approximately equal numbers
of males and females. All animals were s.c. injected with DMH (20 mg/kg
body weight/wk) for 15 weeks. In groups 2 and 4, embelin was given to mice
10 days prior to the first DMH injection, and then continued till harvest at
week 30. In groups 1 and 3, no embelin but vehicle (DMSO) was added to
the diet. Based on the diet consumption, the daily intake of embelin was
estimated to be f100 mg/d/kg body weight.

Histopathologic evaluation of tumorigenesis. All animals were
sacrificed at week 30 following initial DMH injection. Stomach, small
intestines, large intestines, liver, and kidneys were carefully inspected for
macroscopic lesions. The large bowels were excised and cut open
longitudinally and the number of colon tumors was counted and the
volume of the largest tumors was measured. After the macroscopic
inspection, tumor specimens and their adjacent normal tissues were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. A small portion of tumor and adjacent normal
tissue were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. Histologic diagnosis
was performed in H&E-stained slides.
Extraction of nuclear protein and detection for NF-KB activity.
Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was performed as we
previously described (2). Nuclear extract was assayed for the DNA binding
activity of NF-nB by a Nonradioactive Chemiluminescent Transcription
Factor Assay kit.
Immunohistochemistry. The tissue expression of p-p65 (phosphorylated NF-nB) and Cox-2 were examined by immunohistochemistry in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The tissue sections were incubated
with primary antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–
labeled secondary antibody (Dako). The slides were developed with
diaminobenzidine substrate and results were evaluated by a pathologist.
Statistical analysis. The incidences of colonic cancer were analyzed
using Fisher’s exact test. Student’s independent sample t test was used for
pair-wise comparisons. One-way ANOVA, with Dunnett t test, was used for
multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Embelin up-regulated the expression of PPAR;, inhibited
proliferation, and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells.
Embelin enhanced the expression of PPARg in HCT116 cells in a
time-dependent (Fig. 1B) and dose-dependent (Fig. 1D) manner.

Embelin Inhibits Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice

The dose-dependent effect of embelin on PPARg was also observed
at the mRNA level by real-time PCR (Fig. 1D, top).
In parallel with these changes, embelin significantly reduced cell
proliferation and induced apoptosis in this cell type (Fig. 1A). These
effects were also observed in another colon cancer cell line HT29
cells (data not shown). Inhibition of cell proliferation and induction
of apoptosis were associated with decreased expressions of cyclin
D1, survivin, and c-Myc both in a time-dependent and dosedependent manner (Fig. 1B and C). In addition, an increase in
PARP cleavage was observed (C). However, embelin did not alter
the expression of XIAP (Fig. 1C), and the expressions of other IAP
family members, including cIAP2 and cIAP1, were not altered
either (data not shown).
Blocking PPAR; activity partially abrogated the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of embelin on HCT116 cells.
Additional studies were focused on elucidating the mechanisms by
which embelin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in
HCT116 cells. Previously, we observed that XIAP down-regulation
and ligand-induced PPARg activation synergistically inhibit the
growth of colon cancer cells (1–3).
We used dnPPARg to antagonize endogenous PPARg activity
and tested whether blocking PPARg activity could affect the
embelin-induced growth inhibition of colon cancer cells. This
construct had been confirmed to efficiently block the function of
PPARg in HCT116 cells (24). As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection with

pcDNA3 or dnPPARg did not alter the proliferation of HCT116 cells
as compared with controls (cells without any treatment). Following
treatment with embelin, cell proliferation was suppressed by 62.1%
and 64% in control and pcDNA3 transfected cells, respectively. In
contrast, in cells transfected with dnPPARg followed by embelin
treatment, cell proliferation was suppressed by only 34%.
In addition, we examined the effect of dnPPARg on embelininduced apoptosis. Apoptosis was examined by three complimentary assays and similar results were obtained (Fig. 2B). Treatment
of HCT116 wild-type and empty vector cells by 30 Amol/L of
embelin for 24 hours led to increased apoptosis, which was
associated with decreased cyclin D1 and increased PARP cleavage
(Figs. 1C and 2C). Additional studies revealed that embelin-induced
apoptosis, blockade of cyclin D1, and increased PARP cleavage were
partially abrogated by dnPPARg (Fig. 2B and C).
Loss of PPAR; promoted DMH-induced colonic carcinogenesis and the tumor-preventive effect of embelin was partially
dependent on PPAR;. The above results indicated that the
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of embelin was partially
dependent on endogenous PPARg activation. We therefore
investigated whether embelin could alter the incidence of DMHinduced colon carcinogenesis in heterozygous PPARg-deficient
mice. Overall, PPARg+/ mice showed an increased incidence of
colon tumors and enhanced tumor multiplicity compared with
PPARg+/+ mice (tumor incidence, 100% versus 81.3%, respectively;

P < 0.05; tumor multiplicity, 13 F 8 versus 9.8 F 4.4, respectively;
P < 0.05; Table 1; Fig. 3A).
The DMH-induced tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity in
PPARg+/+ mice receiving embelin were significantly lower than
those in PPARg+/+ mice without embelin (tumor incidence, 66.7%
versus 81.3%; P < 0.05; tumor multiplicity, 2.4 F 1 versus 9.8 F 4.4,
respectively; P < 0.05; Table 1; Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, tumor
incidence and multiplicity in PPARg+/ mice receiving embelin
were not significantly different from those in PPARg+/ mice
without embelin exposure (tumor incidence, 92.3% versus 100%,
respectively; P > 0.05; tumor multiplicity, 10.8 F 6.7 versus 13 F 8,
respectively; P > 0.05; Table 1; Fig. 3A).
Macroscopically, the neoplastic lesions in both PPARg+/ and
PPARg+/+ mice were similar in the forms of nodular, polypoid, or
flat-type tumors, and all confined to the middle and distal colon.
No neoplastic lesions were found in the proximal colon, small
intestines, stomach, liver, and kidney. Tumors tended to be smaller
in PPARg+/+ mice compared with PPARg+/ mice, and there were
more tumors that were >216 mm3 (width  length  height, mm)
in the PPARg+/ mice, regardless of embelin exposure status
(Fig. 3A).
Microscopically, tumors showed a spectrum of progression and
various histopathologic types (Fig. 3B). Some tumors comprised of
well-formed elongated tubular glands, features characteristic of
adenoma (a). Some tumors comprised of closely packed but wellformed dilated glands with complex branching lined by dysplastic
epithelia, features consistent with an early well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma (b). The majority of tumors showed glands with
complex irregular branching, fusion of glands with frequent nuclear
stratification, characteristics of moderately differentiated adenoma
(c). A small percentage of tumors showed extensively fused glands

with clearly visible solid areas of packed tumor cells, characteristic
of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (d).
Overall, the vast majority of tumors in PPARg+/ mice were
adenocarcinomas (93.3%), whereas only two-thirds of tumors in
PPARg+/+ mice were adenocarcinomas (68.75%; Table 1). In both
groups, >85% of adenocarcinomas were moderately differentiated,
f10% were poorly differentiated, and the rest were either
adenomas or well-differentiated adenocarcinomas.
Embelin up-regulated the expression of PPAR; in mouse
colon tissues. We then detected the expression of PPARg in
colon tumors and the surrounding nontumorous colonic tissues.
As expected, the protein expression of PPARg in the normal and
colon tumors of PPARg+/+ mice was significantly higher than
that in PPARg+/ mice (Fig. 4A, top), and there was no significant
difference in PPARg expression between colon tumors and their
adjacent normal colonic tissues in both PPARg+/ mice and
PPARg+/+ mice. Following treatment with embelin, PPARg expression was markedly increased in the tumor tissues of both PPARg+/+
and PPARg+/ mice (Fig. 4A, bottom).
PPAR; deficiency is associated with increased NF-KB
activity in colonic tumors. An increase in NF-nB-p50 activity
was observed in the tumor tissues of PPARg+/ mice compared
with PPARg+/+ mice following DMH treatment (Fig. 4B, top). By
immunohistochemistry, the expression of p-p65 in the normal
colonic mucosa of both PPARg+/+ and PPARg+/ mice was very
weak (data not shown). However, in cancerous tissues, expression
of p-p65 in PPARg+/ mice was significantly higher than that in
PPARg+/+ mice (Fig. 4B, bottom).
Following treatment with embelin, NF-nB-p50 transcription
activity and the expression of p-p65 were significantly decreased
in PPARg+/+ mice (Fig. 4B, top). However, in PPARg+/ mice, the

presence or absence of embelin.

Embelin Inhibits Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice

inhibitory effect of embelin on NF-nB activity and p-p65 expression
was minimal.
Embelin-induced reduction in NF-nB activity was associated
with a down-regulation of cyclin D1 in PPARg+/+ (Fig. 4A, bottom,
lanes 10–12 versus lanes 7–9) but only marginally so in PPARg+/
mice. On the other hand, up-regulation of NF-nB activity in
PPARg+/ mice was associated with an increased cyclin D1 protein
expression as compared with PPARg+/+ mice (Fig. 4A, bottom, lanes
1–3 versus lanes 7–9).
Embelin diminished the expression of Cox-2, c-Myc,
survivin, and PCNA in PPAR;+/+ mice but not in PPAR;+/
mice. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of how embelin exerts
its antitumor effect, we examined the expression of Cox-2 and hcatenin in colon tissues, as DMH was known to cause inflammation
and embelin was known to possess anti-inflammatory properties.
By immunohistochemical staining, there was no difference in the
expression of h-catenin between PPARg+/+ mice and PPARg+/
mice, regardless of embelin exposure. No obvious difference was
observed between normal and tumor tissues of each group (data
not shown). Cox-2 is richly expressed in all groups of tissues. In the
presence of embelin, there was a marked decrease in the expression
of Cox-2 in PPARg+/+ mice, but not in PPARg+/ mice, both in the
tumor and adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the
immunohistochemical staining, embelin decreased the expression
of Cox-2 in the colon cancer tissues from PPARg+/+ mice (Fig. 4C).
In addition, embelin decreased the expression of cell proliferation markers PCNA and c-Myc, as well as survivin in PPARg+/+ mice
(Fig. 4C), but not in PPARg+/ mice (data not shown).
Embelin-induced reduction in NF-KB activity was partially
dependent on functional PPAR;. As shown in Fig. 1, embelin
time- and dose-dependently enhanced the expression of PPARg.
We then performed additional studies to test the effect of embelin
on NF-nB. We performed a NF-nB reporter activity assay. As shown
in Fig. 5A, embelin had a minimal effect on basal NF-nB activity in
HCT116 cells, but it significantly blunted TNF-a–stimulated NF-nB
activation. Transfection of cells with dnPPARg almost reversed the
inhibitory effect of embelin on TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation
(Fig. 5A).
The inhibitory effect of embelin on NF-nB was further evidenced
by its effects on some of the NF-nB downstream target genes. We
measured Bcl-xL, c-Myc, and four members of the IAP family
(cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, and survivin). Survivin and c-Myc were
significantly inhibited by embelin (Fig. 1B and C, and Fig. 5B),
whereas no changes were found in Bcl-xL, cIAP1, and cIAP2.
DnPPARg blunted embelin-induced down-regulation of survivin
and c-Myc. No significant changes were observed in XIAP,
regardless of the embelin and dnPPARg treatment (Figs. 1C and
5B, top). Similar results were observed when PPARg was inhibited
by its specific chemical inhibitor, GW9662. For example, GW9662
significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of embelin on survivin
(Fig. 5B, bottom).

Discussion
In this study, we showed that embelin significantly inhibited
growth and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells in vitro and
effectively suppressed DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis in vivo.
The novel finding of this study is that the antitumor effect of
embelin seems to require the presence of functional PPARg.
Consistent with previous studies by others (10), embelin inhibited
NF-nB activity, and such an inhibition was mediated at least in part
by PPARg.

(bottom ). The PPARg-specific inhibitor GW9662 was used to block the PPARg
function. The semiquantitative results (arbitrary units) from desitometric scans
are shown below the Western blot bands.

We found that embelin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation
and apoptosis were associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1,
c-Myc, and survivin. Cyclin D1 plays a critical role in cell cycle
progression, especially at the early G0-G1 phase (25). As cyclin D1 is
under the control of NF-nB, the reduced cyclin D1 expression may
also indicate an inhibition of NF-nB by embelin. Similarly,
inhibition of survivin and c-Myc was also an indicator for
embelin-induced NF-nB inhibition. As c-Myc is important in colon
tumorigenesis and the regulation of the cell cycle, angiogenesis,
and apoptosis (26–29), inhibition of c-Myc expression by embelin
may be an important mechanism responsible for its antitumor
effect.
Importantly, our results revealed, for the first time, that the
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of embelin seem to be
associated with increased PPARg expression. Based on the evidence
of the important role of PPARg in colon cancers (14–16), the finding
prompted us to investigate whether the antitumor effect of embelin
might be mediated by the activation of PPARg.

The ability of PPARg activation to induce apoptosis and growth
inhibition in human cancer cells including colon cancer cell lines is
widely recognized (14, 16, 30). Using a dnPPARg, we found that
dnPPARg dramatically, if not completely, abrogated the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of embelin. In addition, dnPPARg
significantly abolished or attenuated the ability of embelin to
inhibit the expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and survivin, as well as
PARP cleavage, suggesting that embelin-mediated inhibition of cell
proliferation and apoptosis is mediated by PPARg. Our result is
consistent with previous observations that ligand-induced activation of PPARg could selectively inhibit the expression of cyclin
D1 (31).
To further evaluate the effect of PPARg on colon carcinogenesis
and the chemopreventive potential of embelin, we used DMH, a
colon-specific carcinogen (32), to induce colon cancer in mice, in
the presence or absence of embelin. Compared with PPARg+/+
mice, PPARg+/ littermates exhibited a significantly increased
susceptibility to DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis. Our results
are in good agreement with a previous report (22) that PPARg
haploinsufficiency increased the susceptibility of mice to azoxymethane-induced colon cancer. Clearly, PPARg plays a critical role
in preventing colon carcinogenesis.
The most significant finding of our current study is that embelin
markedly reduced the incidence and multiplicity of total tumors in
PPARg+/+ but not PPARg+/ mice, although embelin increased the
PPARg protein expression in both PPARg+/+ and PPARg+/ groups.
These results indicated that the chemopreventive effect of embelin
requires endogenous rather than stimulated PPARg, and the basal
expression level of PPARg may be important. We found that
embelin suppressed colon carcinogenesis without affecting the
tumor pathology, implying that this agent may act on the very early
stage of colon carcinogenesis.
NF-nB signaling is one of the most commonly altered pathways
associated with the development of many malignancies including
colon cancer (33–35). Activation of PPARg has been shown to
inhibit the activity of NF-nB (36). Thus, both transcription factors
may interact to regulate the response of cancer cells to stimuli. We

speculated that the preventive effect of embelin on colon
carcinogenesis in PPARg+/+ mice may be through inhibiting the
NF-nB–mediated transcription. Indeed, reduction of DMH-induced
colon carcinogenesis by embelin in PPARg+/+ mice was associated
with an inhibited NF-nB-p50 transcription activity and a reduced
expression of p-p65. On the other hand, in PPARg+/ mice which
exhibited increased NF-nB activation and p-p65 expression,
embelin did not significantly suppress DMH-induced colon
carcinogenesis. The inhibitory effect of embelin on NF-nB was
also indicated by our finding that embelin suppressed the
expressions of several NF-nB target genes including cyclin D1,
survivin, Cox-2, and c-Myc. Furthermore, embelin-induced reduction of these target genes was more marked in the presence of
functional PPARg, consistent with the finding that embelin had a
more efficient anticancer effect in PPARg+/+ mice.
In conclusion, embelin significantly inhibited the growth of
colon cancer cells by reducing cell proliferation and inducing
apoptosis. Embelin effectively suppressed DMH-induced colon
carcinogenesis in mice when PPARg is present. Thus, PPARg plays
a critical role in DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis. The
antitumor effect of embelin could be attributed to its inhibition
on NF-nB activity, which is dependent on PPARg. Embelin may be a
potential chemopreventive agent against colon carcinogenesis.
