Abstract
HER2-targeted therapy has been shown to have limited efficacy in ovarian cancer
despite frequent overexpression of this receptor. Photochemical internalization (PCI)
is a modality for cytosolic drug delivery, currently undergoing clinical evaluation. In
the present project we studied the application of PCI in combination with the HER2targeted recombinant fusion toxin, MH3-B1/rGel, for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
The SKOV-3 cell line, resistant to trastuzumab- and MH3-B1/rGel- monotherapy, was
shown to respond strongly to PCI of MH3-B1/rGel to a similar extent as observed for
the treatment-sensitive SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Extensive hydrolytic degradation
of MH3-B1/rGel in acidic endocytic vesicles was indicated as the mechanism of
MH3-B1/rGel resistance in SKOV-3 cells. This was shown by the positive Pearson’s
correlation coefficient between Alexa488-labeled MH3-B1/rGel and Lysotracker
in SKOV-3 cells in contrast to the negative Pearson’s correlation coefficient in SKBR-3 cells. The application of PCI to induce the release of MH3-B1/rGel was also
demonstrated to be effective on SKOV-3 xenografts. Application of PCI with MH3-B1/
rGel was further found highly effective in the HER2 expressing HOC-7 and NuTu-19
ovarian cancer cell lines. The presented results warrant future development of PCI in
combination with MH3-B1/rGel as a novel therapeutic approach in preclinical models
of ovarian cancer.

Introduction

breast cancer, de novo as well as acquired resistance are
major limitations in clinical practice [2], leaving patients
with very limited treatment options. In case of ovarian
cancer with known HER2 expression, several HER2targeted drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials [3,
4, 5]. However, no HER2-targeted drug has so far been
approved for clinical use, despite HER2 overexpression
being reported in up to 35 % of all ovarian cancers [6,
7]. New HER2-targeted modalities with increased toxicity
and less potential for development of resistance should
therefore be an interesting approach for future treatment
of ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecologic
cancers. It is often diagnosed at a late stage and the
sensitivity to available anticancer therapeutics is highly
limited. New treatment approaches are therefore warranted
for the management of this disease. HER2 overexpression
is most commonly associated with breast cancer where
HER2 overexpression is found in 20-30 % of the cases [1].
Several HER2-targeted therapeutics have been approved
for clinical use in the treatment of breast cancer. However,
despite the success of HER2-targeted drugs in treating

A weak HER2 band was also detected on overexposed
western blots of Nu-Tu-19 cells (rat orgin) (Fig. 1A).
However, the apparent weak HER2 expression in NuTu-19 cells may be due to poor recognition of HER2 rat
antigen by the antibody (antibody against human HER2)
and comparison of HER2 level between Nu-Tu-19 and the
human cell lines is therefore not possible.

Increased toxicity of HER2-targeted drugs may be
achieved through the utilization of single-chain HER2
antibody-based immunotoxins. Such constructs have
been proven highly HER2 specific in vitro and induce
considerable tumor growth delay in several animal models
[8, 9, 10, 11]. The toxin component in such drugs acts by
inhibition of protein synthesis and provides increased
cytotoxic potential compared to clinically available
HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Off-target cytotoxicity,
which generally has been considered a major limitation for
clinical use of immunotoxins, may be reduced by utilizing
a type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) [12]. In
contrast to highly potent toxins such as ricin, Pseudomonas
exotoxin (PE) and diphtheria toxin, type 1 RIPs lack a
translocation domain which transports the toxin from
endosomes into the cytosol [13]. Thus, a technology which
allows improved endo/lysosomal release of these agents
has the potential to increase specific cytotoxicity provided
by type 1 RIP-based immunotoxins [14]. Photochemical
internalization (PCI) is a technology which causes
cytosolic release of drugs entrapped in endocytic vesicles
[15, 16]. PCI is based on an amphiphilic photosensitizer
(PS) which accumulates in the membranes of endosomes
and lysosomes. Light exposure with appropriate
wavelengths, excites the PS and initiates the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn destroys the
endo/lysosomal membrane [17]. PCI of several drugs has
been proven as an effective treatment modality for cancer
in vivo [18, 19, 20, 21] and ongoing clinical studies on PCI
are showing highly promising results (www.clinicaltrials.
gov; NCT01606566, NCT01872923, NCT01900158).
In the present study we evaluated PCI of the
HER2-targeted single chain antibody-based recombinant
immunotoxin MH3-B1/rGel in three ovarian cancer cell
lines, generally resistant to HER2-targeted therapy, and
also on ovarian cancer xenografts in athymic mice. These
results indicate PCI of HER2-targeted toxins to be a
promising treatment modality for HER2 overexpressing
ovarian cancer and warrants future evaluation in
preclinical models.

Sensitivity of SK-BR-3 and SKOV-3 cells to
HER2-targeted therapeutics
In this study, the responsiveness to PCI of MH3-B1/
rGel was primarily evaluated in 2 HER2 overexpressing
cell lines; the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 and
the human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 (Fig. 1A).
Subjecting the 2 cell lines to a 72 hrs incubation of the
HER2-targeted immunotoxin MH3-B1/rGel revealed a
low TI50 of ~2.4 in the SKOV-3 cell line, compared to
the TI50 of ~136 in SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 1B and 1C). The
lack of response to MH3-B1/rGel in SKOV-3 cells was
also reflected in the response to the scFv targeting moiety
MH3-B1 which reduced the viability by ~20 % in SKOV3 cells compared to ~60 % in SK-BR-3 cells following
a 72 hrs incubation at a 10 µM concentration (Fig. 1D).
The SKOV-3 cells were in addition found resistant to the
HER2-targeted mAb trastuzumab (Fig. 1E), in agreement
with previous reports [29, 31] while the SK-BR-3 cells
responded well with an LD50 of ~100nM. The present
results therefore indicate that SKOV-3 cells are generally
resistant to HER2-targeted antibody-based therapy.

Uptake and cellular localization of Alexa488MH3-B1/rGel in SK-BR-3 and SKOV-3 cells
PCI is a method for cytosolic release of drugs
entrapped in endosomes and lysosomes. PCI in vitro
is usually performed by a 1-18 hrs incubation of the
macromolecule of interest prior to light exposure
[32, 17]. This relatively short incubation time of the
macromolecule is utilized to avoid strong influence of
lysosomal degradation on the PCI outcome. In the present
in vitro protocol, a 4 hrs pulse of 2 nM MH3-B1/rGel was
used prior to the light exposure. Since the intracellular
trafficking of MH3-B1/rGel in the post-treatment period
is expected to influence on the therapeutic effect, a
cytotoxicity evaluation was performed 72 hrs after the
4 hrs pulse of MH3-B1/rGel to verify that SKOV-3 cells
were resistant to MH3-B1/rGel also after a 4 hrs treatment
(Fig. 2A and 2B). The TI’s after 4 hrs treatment were
found to be higher in both cell lines compared to that after
72 hrs treatment. However, the SKOV-3 cells were found
to be relatively less sensitive to the treatment as e.g. 2 nM
MH3-B1/rGel reduced cell viability by ~35 % in SK-BR-3
cells (Fig. 2B), but did not induce detectable cytotoxicity
in the SKOV-3 cell line (Fig. 2A). Calculating the TI at

HER2 expression among the cell lines
The HER2 expression level in the 4 selected human
cancer cell lines was found to vary in agreement with
other reports. Both SK-BR-3 and SKOV-3 were found to
be HER2-high expressing and the HER2 level in SK-BR-3
was indicated higher than observed in the SKOV-3 cells
[10, 28] (Fig. 1A). An intermediate HER2 expression was
found in the HOC-7 cell line [29] (Fig. 1A) while MDAMB-468 was indicated as HER2-low [30, 10] (Fig. 1A).

IC35 of MH3-B1/rGel vs. rGel (TI35) revealed an ~11fold higher TI35 in SK-BR-3 cells compared to SKOV-3
cells after 4 hrs treatment with MH3-B1/rGel. SKOV-3
cells were therefore found resistant to MH3-B1/rGel also
when administrated for 4 hrs compared to SK-BR-3 cells.
Four hrs incubation of MH3-B1 (without rGel) did not
induce any significant cytotoxicity in any of the cell lines,
indicating MH3-B1/rGel-mediated toxicity to be generated
through ribosomal inhibition (Fig. 2A and 2B).
MH3-B1/rGel primarily exerts its intracellular
action by inducing inhibition of protein synthesis. The
mechanism of MH3-B1/rGel resistance in the SKOV-3
cell line could be due to differences in overall uptake and/
or intracellular MH3-B1/rGel localization and trafficking
compared to SK-BR-3 cells. Subjecting SK-BR-3 and
SKOV-3 cells to a 4 hrs incubation of 2 nM Alexa488labeled MH3-B1/rGel revealed a ~2-fold higher Alexa488MH3-B1/rGel uptake in SK-BR-3 cells compared to
SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 2C and 2D). However, this 2-fold

difference could only partly explain the ~11-fold higher
TI35 in SK-BR-3 cells following a 4 hrs MH3-B1/rGel
incubation (Fig. 2A and 2B).
The MH3-B1/rGel construct must eventually
translocate from endosomes and/or lysosomes into
the cytosol to exert its action on the ribosomes and
avoid lysosomal degradation [12]. Thus, differences in
distribution of the targeting toxin in endocytic vesicles
between SKOV-3 and SK-BR-3 cells could explain the
difference in MH3-B1/rGel sensitivity. Intracellular
localization of Alexa488-labeled MH3-B1/rGel was
detected by confocal microscopy which confirmed both
binding of the immunotoxin to the plasma membrane
and cellular internalization to endocytic compartments
in both cell lines (Fig. 2E). The association of Alexa488MH3-B1/rGel to the plasma membrane appeared much
stronger in the SK-BR-3 cells than in the SKOV-3 cells.
However, this visual appearance may at least partly be
due to the more rounded up morphology of the SK-BR-3

cells. Diffuse fluorescence was, in addition, observed in
the cytoplasm of SKOV-3 cells. The thin morphology
of SKOV-3 cells (~1.5 µm), together with the axial
resolution of the microscope (0.56 µm) and differences
in the optimal plane of microscopy between cells in the
same micrograph was, however, found as the reason for
this diffuse fluorescence which was concluded as noise
from the plasma membrane. A significantly higher fraction
(15.2 % vs. 9.6 %) of Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel was found
to colocalize with LTR in SKOV-3 cells than in SK-BR-3
cells (p = 0.0125) (Fig. 2F). The distribution of Alexa488MH3-B1/rGel correlated also better with the distribution
of LTR as revealed by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient
of 0.17 (±0.04) in SKOV-3 cells as compared to -0.059
(±0.02) in the SK-BR-3 cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2G). A
higher distribution of MH3-B1/rGel in acidic endocytic
vesicles in SKOV-3 cells indicates a higher hydrolytic
degradation of the immunotoxin in the vesicles of these
cells compared to SK-BR-3 cells. This hydrolysis may
take place in all acidic endocytic vesicles including both
endosomes and lysosomes [33, 34]. Attempts have been
made to remove plasma membrane associated fusion toxin
in order to quantitatively measure intracellular fusion
toxin. Such a method would make it possible to compare
the impact of e.g. a lysosomotropic agent on MH3-B1/
rGel degradation in the two cell lines. However, the high
plasma membrane association of MH3-B1/rGel in these
two cell lines makes this a difficult task since only small
contamination from the plasma membrane is likely to
influence strongly on this suggested experiment. Thus, the
increased distribution of Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel in acidic
vesicles in the SKOV-3 cell line together with the higher
overall uptake in the SK-BR-3 cells may explain the lower
sensitivity to MH3-B1/rGel in the SKOV-3 cells compared
to SK-BR-3 cells.

to obtain LD50 with PCI with that of the photochemical
treatment (PS and light) and correct the calculation for
cellular differences in sensitivity to the non-targeted toxin
(as described in Materials and Methods, [23]). The PCI
efficacy corrected for rGel-sensitivity in the two cell lines
revealed similar efficacy of PCI of MH3-B1/rGel in the
resistant SKOV-3 cells as in the SK-BR-3 cells (p > 0.05)
(Fig. 3D). The rGel-corrected PCI efficacy in MDAMB-468 cells was, however, found to be 6.8- and 6.3-fold
reduced compared to that in SK-BR-3 and SKOV-3 cells
respectively (Fig. 3D).

PCI of MH3-B1/rGel in HOC-7 and NuTu-19 cells
Ovarian cancer is generally known to have low
sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapeutics despite strong
HER2 expression [3, 5]. The high PCI-induced efficacy
of MH3-B1/rGel in SKOV-3 cells was therefore also
tested in the ovarian cancer cell lines HOC-7 and NuTu19. HOC-7 cells were found resistant to trastuzumab and
MH3-B1/rGel to a comparable level as detected in SKOV3 cells (Fig. 4A and 4B, Fig. 1B and 1E). Accordingly,
NuTu-19 cells have previously been reported to not
respond to trastuzumab [35] and were also found resistant
to MH3-B1/rGel (Fig. 4C). PCI was shown to increase the
effect of MH3-B1/rGel significantly in HOC-7 and NuTu-19 cells (Fig. 4D and 4E), indicating that MH3-B1/
rGel is accumulating specifically in both cell lines
although the therapeutic specificity is more strongly seen
after activation by PCI. These results are in accordance
with those seen in the SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 3B). HER2
expression in HOC-7 cells was, however, much lower than
observed for SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 1A).

The high efficacy of PCI of MH3-B1/rGel in
the MH3-B1/rGel resistant SKOV-3 cells was further
evaluated on SKOV-3 subcutaneous xenografts in athymic
mice. This is a relatively slow growing tumor model and
the mean time to reach the endpoint of 800 mm3 from
a treatment volume of ~100 mm3 was 43.4 days (Fig.
6D). The photochemical treatment induced edema and
accurate measurements of tumors were therefore difficult
to obtain the first ~2 weeks after treatment. Early effects
on tumor growth following the different treatments were
assessed on day 16 since this was the first day without any
detectable edema in any of the animals. Comparing the
size of all tumors at day 16 revealed significantly smaller
tumors in the PCI group compared to the control groups
receiving either MH3-B1/rGel, photochemical treatment
or no treatment (Fig. 5A and 5C). No significant difference
was found between the no treatment group and the groups
receiving MH3-B1/rGel or photochemical treatment as

Since high hydrolytic degradation was indicated as
a potential mechanistic cause of the low MH3-B1/rGel
sensitivity in the SKOV-3 cells, we hypothesized that PCI
may be useful in addressing this mechanism of resistance.
Studies combining PCI and MH3-B1/rGel demonstrated
highly effective cytotoxicity against SKOV-3 cells and
appeared to reduce the cell viability to the same extent
as observed for the SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 3A and 3B). PCI
of MH3-B1/rGel was also indicated as HER2 selective
when compared to PCI of non-targeted rGel (Fig. 3A and
3B) and also when comparing the PCI data for SK-BR-3
and SKOV-3 cells with those obtained with the HER2 low
expressing cell line MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 3A-3C). The
efficacy of PCI of MH3-B1/rGel has recently been shown
to correlate well with HER2 expression [23]. PCI efficacy
may be established by comparing the light dose needed

monotherapies. Neither was there any difference in tumor
size between the group receiving MH3-B1/rGel and the
photochemical treatment group at day 16 (Fig. 5A and
5C).
The percent change in tumor size at day 16
compared to the tumor size measured at day 0 for each
animal, revealed a stronger inhibition of tumor growth in
the PCI group than in the control groups. All the animals
in the MH3-B1/rGel monotherapy and no treatment group
showed an increase in tumor volume at day 16 compared
to day 0 (Fig. 5B). However, the tumors subjected to the
photochemical treatment (PS and light) showed an overall
lower growth and even some reduction in tumor volume.
The volume of the tumors in the PCI group was even
smaller than those only subjected to the photochemical
treatment (PS and light) and a higher number of tumors
showed a reduced tumor volume.
Although statistically not significant, a treatment
response of SKOV-3 tumors following PCI of MH3-B1/
rGel was also indicated in Kaplan-Meier plots between

day 38 and 50 post light exposure (Fig. 6A). At day 50,
44 % of the animals that received PCI of MH3-B1/rGel
had tumors with a size < 800 mm3 compared to 20 % in
the photochemical treatment group, whereas all the tumors
in the no treatment group and the group that received
MH3-B1/rGel monotherapy had reached the end point
of 800 mm3 (Fig. 6A). Measurements of tumor growth
delay confirmed treatment response in the PCI group
compared to the control groups also at day 20, 30 and 40
post-treatment as illustrated in Fig. 6C. The mean time
to reach a tumor volume of 800 mm3 is presented in Fig.
6D and growth curves is presented in S1. No correlation
was found between the actual tumor size at the day of
treatment and treatment response.
The effect of the applied PCI treatment was smaller
than expected from the encouraging in vitro data presented
here in addition to previous in vivo reports on PCI of other
targeting toxins [20, 21]. The 48 hrs interval between
MH3-B1/rGel administration and light exposure used
in this study was based on MH3-B1/rGel accumulation

decreased to 24 hrs to study if this would increase the
treatment response. No increase in efficacy was, however,
detected by reducing the MH3-B1/rGel-to-light interval to

SKOV-3 tumors verified high expression of HER2 in these

MH3-B1/rGel as the detection limit for MH3-B1/rGel on
a western blot which would correspond to 208 ng (3.78
x10-12 mol) MH3-B1/rGel/g tumor tissue in a 0.2 g tumor.
The amount of MH3-B1/rGel localized to the tumors at
the time of light exposure with the present protocol was
therefore less than 3.78 x 10-12 moles/g tumor tissue.

HER2-positive, although HER2 was more pronounced
in SK-BR-3 cells in agreement with a previous report
[39]. The increased level of HER2 found in SK-BR-3
cells could, however, not explain the ~60-fold higher TI
(72 hrs incubation) of MH3-B1/rGel compared to the
SKOV-3 cells or the significantly decreased sensitivity to
MH3-B1 or trastuzumab in SKOV-3 cells. The mechanism
of MH3-B1/rGel toxicity is dual because it (i): inhibits
HER2 signaling and function through MH3-B1 and
(ii): induces toxicity through the rGel payload which
acts intracellulary by inactivating ribosomes leading
to a generalized inhibition of protein synthesis. SKOV3 cells have also previously been reported resistant to
trastuzumab [28, 31]. Trastuzumab resistance in SKOV3 cells is shown to depend on a constitutive activation
of AKT, caused by lack of the tumor suppressor protein
RAS homolog member I and also on low expression of
PTEN which is recruited to the plasma membrane upon
trastuzumab–HER2 association and inhibits AKT as one
of the main mechanisms of trastuzumab induced G1 arrest
[28, 40]. MH3-B1 binds to another domain of HER2
than trastuzumab (results not published). The present
results show, however, that SKOV-3 cells are resistant
also to MH3-B1. AKT inhibition post MH3-B1 treatment
was not assessed in the present study, and has not been
reported before. However, the observed cross-resistance
between trastuzumab and MH3-B1 may indicate a partial
overlapping mechanism of resistance between these two
HER2-targeted compounds.
In our study, 72 hrs treatment of MH3-B1/rGel
in SKOV-3 cells induced only minor toxicity by HER2
inhibition as shown by the MH3-B1-induced reduction in
viability at comparable concentrations. Four hrs incubation
of MH3-B1 did not induce any reduction in viability in
SKOV-3 or SK-BR-3 cells at doses < 10 µM (Fig. 2A and
2B). The ~11-fold increased TI of MH3-B1/rGel in SKBR-3 cells compared to the SKOV-3 cell line after a 4 hrs
incubation of the toxins therefore indicate that SKOV-3
cells are resistant also to the gelonin-induced toxicity of
MH3-B1/rGel.
PCI is a method for cytosolic release of therapeutics
entrapped in endocytic vesicles [17]. Endocytic trapping
and subsequent hydrolytic degradation of MH3-B1/rGel
as an important mechanism of resistance in SKOV-3
cells was shown by the efficacy of PCI in this cell line.
The similar efficacy of PCI of MH3-B1/rGel (rGelcorrected PCI efficacy) in SKOV-3 and SK-BR-3 cells
found (Fig. 3D), despite the ~2-fold higher MH3-B1/rGel
accumulation in SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 2D), also suggests a
higher distribution of MH3-B1/rGel to endocytic vesicles
in SKOV-3 cells. The higher distribution of MH3-B1/rGel
in acidic vesicles in SKOV-3 cells is also reflected in the
higher Pearson’s correlation coefficient of MH3-B1/rGel
and LTR found in this cell line (Fig. 2G). A more detailed
mechanistic explanation on MH3-B1/rGel resistance
should be addressed in future studies. These studies may

Adverse effects of the treatment
Damage to the liver and kidneys of mice was
evaluated 24 hrs after the PCI treatment. No adverse
effects on the kidneys were noted by histopathology
and also by measuring the serum levels of creatinine,
an indicator of renal function (Fig. 7A and 7B).
Hepatocytes, however, showed their central nuclei
surrounded by many vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7A),
a typical morphological alteration indicating reversible
degeneration. This is consistent with the results which
demonstrated a significant increase in serum levels of
AST and ALT (Fig. 7B) in the PCI-treated animals.
Such reversible hepatic degeneration indicates that the
PCI treatment may induce a slight liver toxicity, but
with no reduction in the daily activities as well as body
weight of the treated mice. In the skin, erythema for up
to 2 weeks was detected at the illuminated area, while
light alone (without PS) as a control did not cause such
effect. In addition, a small wound in the treated area was
observed in 3 out of 10 mice, but leaving no scarring.
Thus, generally, PCI of MH3-B1/rGel was considered as
a tolerable treatment.

Discussion
In the present study, we have utilized the
intracellular drug delivery technology PCI to potentiate
the cytotoxicity of the HER2-targeted recombinant
immunotoxin, MH3-B1/rGel in HER2 overexpressing
ovarian cancer cell lines. Ovarian cancer is the most
lethal of all gynecological cancers with a 5 year survival
of only 44.2% [36]. Up to 35% of ovarian cancers have
been reported as HER2-positive [37, 6, 7]. HER2-targeted
antibodies and molecular inhibitors have, however, failed
to demonstrate significant clinical benefit as monotherapy
[38] and the prognostic value of HER2 expression in
ovarian cancer is controversial [38]. The aim of this study
was to utilize HER2 as the delivery portal for MH3-B1/
rGel to endocytic vesicles in the ovarian cancer cell line
SKOV-3. PCI-induced cytosolic translocation of MH3-B1/
rGel should further facilitate ribosomal binding, inhibition
of protein synthesis and induction of cell death. The
HER2-positive breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, recently
reported as highly sensitive to PCI of MH3-B1/rGel [23]
was used as a positive control throughout the study.
Both SKOV-3 and SK-BR-3 cells were found to be

inhibitors of hydrolytic activity.
PCI of MH3-B1/rGel on SKOV-3 xenografts in
nude mice also revealed significantly smaller tumors
in the PCI group compared to all control groups when
measured 16 days after light exposure. This in vivo effect
was smaller than expected based on the presented in
vitro results and also on other reports on PCI of geloninbased immunotoxins [20, 21]. It has previously been
shown that as little as 6.3 x 10-12 moles/g tumor tissue is
sufficient for complete remission with an immunotoxin
based on PE (anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38) [41]. We have tried,
by western blotting, to evaluate the amount of MH3-B1/
rGel present in SKOV-3 tumors 48 hrs post i.v. injection
of doses of 2 mg/kg (0.05 mg/mouse). We believe that
this dose was likely below the limit of detection of our
western analysis which was found to correspond to 3.78
x10-12 moles/g tumor tissue. Compared to PE, rGel lacks
a domain for cytosolic translocation [13]. If PCI can
induce a 100% cytosolic release of MH3-B1/rGel, the 2
mg/kg dose administered 48 hrs prior to light exposure
is still significant less than what has previously been
indicated as a curative dose of PE. However, we find it
highly promising that the small amount of tumor-localized
MH3-B1/rGel appears to demonstrate antitumor activity in
combination with PCI.
In the present study, only a single i.v. injection
at a dose of 2 mg/kg was used. The increased efficacy
provided by PCI has previously been shown to induce
complete responses following only one injection of
gelonin-based immunotoxins at comparable doses as
here applied, however, the lack of severe adverse effects
following 2 mg/kg of MH3-B1/rGel suggests that this dose
may be increased to improve the PCI-induced efficacy. A
significant effect on tumor growth delay has previously
been reported after a fractionated dose (6 injections
in 10 days) of 24 mg/kg MH3-B1/rGel [9]. This report
therefore warrants a demonstration of higher single doses
of MH3-B1/rGel, than currently available, in combination
with PCI.
Altogether, the presented data suggest PCI of
MH3-B1/rGel as a HER2-targeted treatment approach
for HER2-positive cancers, including ovarian cancers
resistant to HER2-targeted therapeutics. We have recently
reported that PCI of MH3-B1/rGel exerts HER2-induced
toxicity also in breast cancer with low HER2 expression
[23]. PCI of MH3-B1/rGel may therefore be beneficial
not only to the ~35% of ovarian cancers with high
HER2 expression, but also in cases with medium to low
HER2 expression. Although also effective in HER2-low
expressing cancer, the PCI-induced efficacy of MH3-B1/
rGel clearly correlates with HER2 expression [23] (Fig.
3). Off-target effects of the treatment in HER2 positive
normal cells should, in addition, be of minor importance
since off-target tissue in general (except in the liver) will
accumulate less PS [42] and will not be subjected to light
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exposure. The present report warrants further evaluation
in preclinical ovarian cancer models. These studies will
also include pharmacologic evaluation to conclude on the
mechanisms of cell death induced by the treatment. The in
vivo protocol must, however, be optimized with respect to
MH3-B1/rGel dose.

Materials and methods
Cell lines and cultivation
Four HER2 overexpressing cell lines were used in
this study. The ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV3 (ATCC, HTB-77™), purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), the
human breast adenocarcinoma cell line SK-BR-3, kindly
provided by the Department of Biochemistry, Institute
for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo
University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, the human ovarian
carcinoma cell line HOC-7, kindly provided by Dr.
Yvonne Anderson, Department of Tumor Biology, Institute
for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo
University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, and the rat ovarian
cancer cell line NuTu-19, originally a gift from Dr. A.L
Major, University of Geneva, Switzerland [22]. The
HER2 low expressing human breast adenocarcinoma cell
line MDA-MB-468 (ATCC, HTB-132TM) was obtained
from ATCC. SKOV-3 and SK-BR-3 cells were cultured
in McCoy’s 5A medium while HOC-7 and NuTu-19
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. Both media
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis MO) and
modified as previously described [23]. The MDA-MB-468
cells were cultured in Leibovitz`s L-15 medium (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) modified as previously described [23]
with free gas exchange with atmospheric air.

Preparation of MH3-B1 and MH3-B1/rGel
The HER2-targeted single chain antibody-fragment
MH3-B1 and the HER2-targeted recombinant fusion toxin
MH3-B1/rGel were produced as previously reported [9].
rGel is the recombinant version of the type I RIP gelonin.

Evaluation of cytotoxicity
The MTT viability assay was in the present study
used to assess cytotoxicity of the different treatments.
Cytotoxicity data, as measured by clonal cell survival, has
previously been compared with MTT data as obtained here
[24, 25]. No significant difference has been observed in
these studies.

cellular sensitivity to rGel treatment as follows [23]:

Cells were seeded at 2.5x103 (SKOV-3), 6.0x103
(SK-BR-3), 2x103 (HOC-7) and 1.5x103 (NuTu-19) cells/
well in 96-well plates (Nunc) and allowed to attach to
the substratum overnight. The cells were then subjected
to a 72 hrs incubation of increasing concentrations of
trastuzumab (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
or the scFv MH3-B1. To examine the cytotoxicity of the
immunotoxin MH3-B1/rGel, the cells were incubated
with MH3-B1/rGel or rGel for 4 or 72 hrs and the MTT
viability assay was done 72 hrs post treatment initiation
for both incubation procedures as previously reported [23].
IC50 (72 hrs incubation) or IC35 (4 hrs incubation) values
of MH3-B1/rGel and rGel were calculated from sigmoidal
curves (see 2.11) and used for establishing the targeting
index (TI) of MH3-B1/rGel:

Western blot analysis
For assessment of HER2 expression, sample
preparation and western blotting were performed as
previously described [23]. Three different substrate
detection systems were used on the Western blots
dependent on the band signal; LumiGlo chemiluminescent
substrate system (KPL, Gaithesburg, MD USA),
Supersignal West Dura Extended duration Substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and Supersignal
West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo
Scientific). Unfortunately, we were not able to find any
antibody recognizing rat HER2.
For detection of HER2 and MH3-B1/rGel in SKOV3 tumors, MH3-B1/rGel was injected i.v. at 2 mg/kg when
the tumors reached 200mm3. The tumors were harvested
48 hrs post injection and prepared as previously described
[26]. Prior to SDS-PAGE, the samples were mixed with
5x reducing buffer and western blotting was performed
as recently described [23]. The primary anti-gelonin
polyclonal antibody was established by the Rosenblum
lab.

rGel and MH3-B1/rGel. The TI at IC35 (TI35) was assessed
by the same formula inserting the IC35 values.

Light source
The cells were exposed to light from LumiSource®
(PCI Biotech AS, Oslo, Norway), delivering blue light
(λmax = 435 nm) from a bank of four 18W Osram L 18/67
light tubes with an irradiance of 12.6 mW/cm2, varying
less than 10 % across the illumination area.

PCI of MH3-B1/rGel in vitro
The PS TPCS2a (meso-tetraphenyl chlorin with two
sulfonate groups on adjacent phenyl rings, Amphinex®)
was provided by PCI Biotech AS. Experiments with
TPCS2a were performed under subdued light. Cells were
seeded at 10x103 (SK-BR-3), 5x103 (SKOV-3), 3x103
(HOC-7) and 2x103 (NuTu-19) cells/well in 96-well plates
(Nunc) and allowed to attach for 6 hrs. MDA-MB-468
were seeded at 8x103 cells/well and attached over night.
Cells were then subjected to 0.4 µg/ml (SK-BR-3, SKOV3, HOC-7 and NuTu-19) or 0.1 µg/ml (MDA-MB-468)
TPCS2a for 18 hrs, washed twice with culture medium and
incubated with 2 nM MH3-B1/rGel for 4 hrs before the
medium was replaced with new drug-free culture medium
and the cells exposed to increasing doses of light from
LumiSource®. All treatment regimens were performed in
triplicates and the MTT assay was used for cell viability
evaluation 48 hrs (SK-BR-3, HOC-7, NuTu-19 and MDAMB-468) or 96 hrs (SKOV-3) after light exposure as
previously reported [23]. PCI efficacy was corrected for

Cellular uptake and localization of Alexa488MH3-B1/rGel
Alexa488-labeled MH3-B1/rGel was prepared as
recently described [23]. For evaluation of cellular uptake
of Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel, cells were seeded at 4x105
(SK-BR-3) and 3x105 (SKOV-3) cells/well in 6-well
plates and treated and analyzed as previously reported by
a BD FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer and BD CellQuest™
software (Becton-Dickinson) [23].
Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel was also used to evaluate
the cellular localization of MH3-B1/rGel by confocal
microscopy in the presence of Lysotracker® (LTR) as
recently reported [23].
To calculate the degree of overlap between the

chromophores Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel and LTR, the
weighted colocalization coefficient Manders’ thresholded
coefficient (MTC) was used. The calculation of the MTC
designates the sum of intensities of colocalizing pixels in
the respective channel, as compared to the overall sum of
pixel intensities above threshold and formulated by:

was maintained by placing the animal on a water-heated
plate. The mice were covered by aluminum foil during
light exposure, exposing only the tumor area and a ~2 mm
margin to light. Tumor volume, measured by a caliper, and
weight were monitored 2-3 times a week. Tumor volume
was calculated by the equation; 0.5 x L x W2 (L = length
and W = width of tumor). Animals were euthanized by
cervical dislocation when tumor volume exceeded 1000
mm3.

where Ch1i,coloc is the fluorescence intensity of
Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel in each pixel where the intensity
of LTR is above threshold, and ΣCh1i is the sum of
Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel pixel intensities above threshold
in the cells. A threshold was set above the noise level
for each chromophore, and was determined by imaging
control cells in the absence of LTR and PS. The same
threshold was used in all cells [27].
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) was
used to calculate the correlation between the fluorescence
intensity of Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel and LTR where
a value of 1 represents 100 % positive correlation, 0
indicates no correlation and -1 represents a total negative
correlation formulated by:

Assessment of liver and kidney toxicity
The animals were divided in 2 groups: no-treatment
and PCI of MH3-B1/rGel with 4 animals in each
group. The animals were anesthetized and subjected to
cardiac puncture 24 hrs after light exposure when 1 ml
whole blood was transferred with a 1 ml syringe (27
G Kidneys) to a 4 ml LH Lithium Heparin Separator
(Greiner Bio One, Austria). The tubes were subjected to
a 15 min centrifugation at 2500 G and serum aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
and creatinine were assayed on a Cobas6000 (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) within 1.5 hrs after
blood sampling. and liver were removed immediately
after cardiac puncture and fixed 3 days in formalin prior
to H&E staining as previously described [21]. One of the
PCI of MH3-B1/rGel treated animals was excluded from
the study due to difficulties with the cardiac puncture.

where Ch1i and Ch2i is the fluorescence intensity
from Alexa488-MH3-B1/rGel and LTR in each pixel,
respectively, and Ch1avg and Ch2avg are the average
intensity values of the two chromophores [27]. All
calculations were made from nine measured cells from
three independent experiments.

Statistical analysis
Sigmaplot™ version 12.5 (Systat Software Inc.,
San Jose, CA, USA) and IBM SPSS (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, New York, US) were used for statistical analysis.
A 2-sided Student’s t-test was used to measure statistical
differences and a value of p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

PCI of MH3-B1/rGel in vivo
All handling of animals were performed according
to standards set by the institutional animal care and use
committee, in compliance with the Norwegian Animal
Research Authority’s guidelines. Cultured subconfluent
SKOV-3 cells were injected subcutaneously on the left
leg of Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu female mice (5x106
cells/animal). At a tumor size of 75-225 mm3, the mice
were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups; no
treatment, MH3-B1/rGel, photochemical treatment and
PCI of MH3-B1/rGel. The PS TPCS2a was administered
intravenously at 5 mg/kg 72 hrs prior to light exposure
and 2 mg/kg (100 µl of 0.534 mg/ml stock solution) of
MH3-B1/rGel was injected intravenously 24 hrs or 48 hrs
before light exposure. Tumors were illuminated by a 652
nm diode laser (CeramOptec GmbH, Bonn, Germany)
equipped with a laserfiber (Medlight SA, Ecublens,
Switzerland) at an irradiance of 90 mW cm-2 and a total
dose of 20 J cm-2. Sevoflurane inhalation gas was used as
an anesthetic during light exposure and body temperature
