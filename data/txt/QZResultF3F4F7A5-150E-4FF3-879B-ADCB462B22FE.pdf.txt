ABSTRACT
The pharmacological importance of cannabinoids has been in study for several
years. Cannabinoids comprise of (a) the active compounds of the Cannabis sativa
plant, (b) endogenous as well as (c) synthetic cannabinoids. Though cannabinoids
are clinically used for anti-palliative effects, recent studies open a promising
possibility as anti-cancer agents. They have been shown to possess anti-proliferative
and anti-angiogenic effects in vitro as well as in vivo in different cancer models.
Cannabinoids regulate key cell signaling pathways that are involved in cell survival,
invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, etc. There is more focus on CB1 and CB2, the two
cannabinoid receptors which are activated by most of the cannabinoids. In this review
article, we will focus on a broad range of cannabinoids, their receptor dependent and
receptor independent functional roles against various cancer types with respect to
growth, metastasis, energy metabolism, immune environment, stemness and future
perspectives in exploring new possible therapeutic opportunities.

INTRODUCTION

protein-coupled receptors named as cannabinoid receptor,
CB1 (Central receptor) and CB2 (Peripheral receptor)
respectively [4-5]. CB1 and CB2 have been cloned and
characterized from mammalian tissues, the main difference
between them being their tissue expression pattern [6].
CB1 receptors are ubiquitously located, with their highest
presence found in the central nervous system (basal
ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex) where they
mediate cannabinoid psychoactive effects [7-8]. CB1
receptors are also present in peripheral nerve terminals,
as well as in extra-neural tissues such as testis, uterus,
vascular endothelium, eye, spleen, ileum and in adipocytes
[8]. CB2 receptor expression is mostly restricted to
particular elements of the immune system (enriched area
of B lymphocyte) [9-10]. The human CB2 receptor shows
68% amino acid homology with the CB1 receptor in the
trans-membrane domains and a 44% overall homology
[9]. Cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands
termed as the endocannabinoid system have been
used as putative molecular targets for the treatment of
various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases

Cannabis sativa plant has been used for several
hundreds of years both recreationally and medicinally.
Centuries ago, the Chinese medicine refers to cannabis
plant for pain-relief and hallucination. It contains 3 major
classes of bioactive molecules; flavanoids, terpenoids and
more than 60 types of cannabinoids [1]. Cannabinoids
are the active compounds of this marijuana plant. But,
the use of cannabinoids is in question because of their
phsychotropic and addictive issues. The most active
constituent of this plant is ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(∆9-THC), elucidated between 1940s and 1960s [2].
This discovery has opened the way to identification of
the molecular action of various cannabinoids and the
cannabinoid receptors. Evidence shows that smoking of
cannabis preparations caused cancer of the respiratory
and oral tracts or, at least, potentiated tobacco smokeinduced damages [3]. Cannabinoid is a family of complex
chemicals (terpenophenolic compounds) that exert most
of their actions by binding to and activating specific Gαi

Recently cannabinoid’s role has been explored in the
area of cancer research. Cancer is caused by uncontrolled
proliferation of cells and the ability of these cells to invade

into other tissues and spread. Anti-cancer agents function
as apoptotic, cell cycle defective or DNA damage agents.
A major discovery in cancer in cannabinoid use in cancer
treatment is its ability in targeted killing of tumors. Several
preclinical studies suggest that ∆9-THC, other naturally
occurring cannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoid agonists
and endocannabinoids have anti-cancer effects in vitro

bind to CB1 or CB2 receptors. Several pharmacological
evidences show that endocannabinoids also exert
biological effects through non-CB1/CB2 receptors [13].
Endocannabinoids mainly act as neuromodulators or
retrograde messengers which affect the release of various
neurotransmitters in the peripheral and neural tissues [14].
They also play important role in inflammation, insulin
sensitivity, and fat and energy metabolism. Inhibition of
endocannabinoids may be a tool in reducing the prevalence
of metabolic syndrome [15]. Two of the best characterized
endocannabinoids are N-arachidonoylethanolamine
(AEA-anandamide) and 2- arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) which affect our mood, appetite, pain sensation,
inflammation response, and memory [7, 16]. Anandamide
which was isolated from porcine brain in 1992 was shown
as the first brain metabolite, to function as a ligand for
CB1, [7]. 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol which was isolated
from canine gut acts through both CB1 and CB2 receptors
[16-17]. Palmitoyl-ethanolamide, or N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)
hexadecamide (N-acyl-ethanolamide) is co-synthesized
with anandamide in all tissues and acts through CB2
[18-20]. Other unsaturated fatty acid ethanolamides
like Docosatetraenylethanolamide and Homo-γlinoenylethanolamide act as agonists for the neuronal
CB1 receptor [20-21]. Another putative endogenous
cannabinoid, oleamide, or cis-9-octadecenoamide, has
also been isolated and shown to have similar actions to
anandamide in the behavioral rodent tests [22].

against lung carcinoma, gliomas, thyroid epithelioma,
lymphoma, skin carcinoma, uterine carcinoma, breast
cancer, prostate carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and
neuroblastoma [4]. These findings were also supported by
in vivo studies and the majority of effects of cannabinoids
are mediated via CB1 and CB2. The transient receptor
potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) has been described
as an additional receptor target for several cannabinoids.
In addition, the palliative effects of cannabinoids include
inhibition of nausea and emesis which are associated
with chemo- or radiotherapy, appetite stimulation, pain
relief, mood elevation and relief from insomnia in cancer
patients. Synthetic THC (Marinol, Dronabinol) and its
derivative nabilone (Cesamet), as well as Sativex, have
been approved in several countries to control nausea
and cancer-related pain in cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy [11-12]. In this review article we focused
on the role of cannabionds in different cancer types and
the respective signaling pathways.

Cannabinoid and its receptor
Cannabinoids can be classified into three groups
based on their source of production; endogenous
cannabinoids (endocannabinoids), phytocannabinoids
and synthetic cannabinoids (Fig.1) and their putative
molecular targets (CB1 or CB2 receptor or TRPV1) have
been identified (Table I). The central and most of the
peripheral effects of cannabinoids rely on CB1 receptor
activation.

Phytocannabinoids

Endogenous cannabinoids

Phytocannabinoids are only known to occur
naturally in significant quantity in the cannabis plant,
and are concentrated in a viscous resin that is produced
in glandular structures known as trichomes. ∆9-THC,
cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN) are the

Endogenous cannabinoids which are produced in
our body include lipid molecules containing long-chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids, amides, esters and ethers that

most prevalent natural cannabinoids [23]. ∆9-THC
binds with similar affinities for both CB1 and CB2
receptors at submicromolar concentration. It behaves as
a CB1 receptor partial agonist and CB1/CB2 receptor
antagonist [24]. ∆8-THC has similar affinities for CB1
and CB2 receptors as like ∆9-THC [25]. Other common
cannabinoids are cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabigerol
(CBG), Cannabichromene (CBC), Cannabicyclol (CBL),
Cannabivarin (CBV), Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV),
Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromevarin (CBCV),

Synthetic cannabinoids
Synthetic cannabinoids have been extensively used
as a pharmacological agent, both in vitro and in vivo, to
obtain more detailed insight of cannabinoid action, in
order to evaluate their potential clinical use. They showed
both antineoplastic and protumoral activity, depending
5856

Oncotarget

on type of agonist, target tissues, route of administration,
doses and duration of the treatment [26-27]. Synthetic
cannabinoids are classified on the basis of chemical
structure of molecules and they are capable of a more
selective activation of cannabinoid receptor [28].

cannabinoids that fall in this category.
c) Aminoalkylindoles
These are a family of aminoalkylindoles with
cannabimimetic properties. R-(+)-WIN55212 is the most
well known compound in this series. It exhibits high
affinity for both cannabinoid receptors, but more selective
for CB2. It has similar pharmacological effects like
THC in vivo. JWH-015 and L-768242 also show affinity
towards CB2 than R-(+)-WIN55212 [32].

a) Classical cannabinoids
Compounds isolated from the plant C. sativa
or synthetic analogs of these compounds fall into this
category. HU-210, Δ9-THC, Δ8-THC and desacetyl-Lnantradol are synthetic cannabinoids which behave as
CB1/CB2 receptor agonists (lack of CB1/CB2 selectivity.
The most psychotropic component of the C.sativa plant
is Δ9-THC which shows affinity for both the cannabinoid
receptors. Increased affinity of HU-210 is due to replacing
pentyl side chain of Δ8-THC with a dimethylheptyl group.
Other CB2-selective agonists that have been synthesized
by structurally modifying THC molecule are JWH-133,
JWH-139, and HU-308 and L-759633 and L-759656
which was effective in nanomolar range [29-31].

d) Eicosanoids
Anandamide, which is an endogenous cannabinoid
ligand was originally discovered in mammalian brain and
other tissues and acts similar to THC. Methanandamide,
its R-(+)-isomer is nine times more CB1 specific than the
S-(+)-isomer [33]. 2-arachidonoylglycerol, another well
studied endocannabinoid has both CB1 and CB2 affinities.
Other compounds are arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide
(ACEA) and arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA).

b) Nonclassical Cannabinoids

e) Others

These are a family of AC-bicyclic and ACDtricyclic cannabinoid analogs. Furthermore bi-cyclic
analog, CP55940, an important cannabinoid agonist has
similar affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors. Also, it is
highly potent in vivo. CP55244 and CP47497 are other

These represent diarylpyrazole compounds which
function antagonistic to cannabinoid receptors [34].
SR141716A is a potent CB1 antagonist and SR144528 is
a CB2 antagonist [35-36]. AM251 and AM281 are analogs
of SR141716A which block CB1 receptor-mediated
effects.

cancer types.

Cannabinoids and breast cancer

The widespread distribution of cannabinoid
receptors (CB1/2,TRPV1) regulate a variety of central
and peripheral physiological functions, including
neuronal development, neuromodulatory processes,
energy metabolism as well as cardiovascular, respiratory,
reproductive functions. CB1/2 receptors are also
responsible for proliferation, motility, invasion, adhesion
and apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo
(Table II). CB1/2 receptor activation leads to various
events like affecting Ca2+ and K+ channels, modulation
of adenyl cyclase and cyclic AMP (c-AMP) levels
in most tissues and models, regulation of members
mitogen activated protein kinase family (MAPKs), like
extracellular signal regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2),
p38, MAPK and c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) [37-38]
as shown in Fig.2.

Breast cancer is one of the most common human
malignancies and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in women, and its incidence in the
developing world is on the rise [40-41]. It represents
approximately 30% of newly diagnosed cancers each year.
It is mainly classified into three main subtypes according
to their molecular profiles: hormone receptor-positive,
HER2-positive (ErbB2-positive, a member of EGFR
family) and triple-negative tumors [42-43]. Cannabinoidbased medicines have been useful for the treatment of
these three breast cancer subtypes.
CB1 and CB2 receptor expression has been
described in different breast cancer tissue and cell line
by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western blot.
CB1 expression was detected in 14% of human Her-2
positive breast cancer tumor tissue and 28% of human
breast carcinoma [26, 44]. But no correlation between
CB1 expression and ErbB2 expression was found [44].
CB1 receptors are also present in different breast cancer
cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-MB-231, TSA-E1,
MDA-MB-468) and in human breast tissues [26, 45-51].
By contrast, CB2 immunoreactivity was detected in 72%
of human breast tumor tissue and 91% of ErbB2-positive
tumor tissue, suggesting a link between CB2 and ErbB2expression [44].The expression of CB2 receptor was also
analyzed in different breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF7, T-47D, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, EVSA-T,
SkBr3) and human breast tissues [26, 44-46, 49, 51-52].
The putative novel cannabinoid receptor subtype GPR55
was highly expressed in a MDA-MB-231 cells, but it is
expressed at lower (30-fold) levels in MCF-7 cells [53].

1. Role of cannabinoids in regulation of cancer
growth
One of the important aspects of an effective antitumor drug is its ability to inhibit proliferation of cancer
cells. Cancer cells proliferate rapidly in uncontrolled
manner. Also, these cells escape death mechanism which
a normal cell undergoes like apoptosis. Apoptosis is a
kind of programmed cell death (PCD) mechanism which
involves activation of caspase dependent and independent
pathways [39]. Cannabinoids have been proved to be antiproliferative and apoptotic drugs. This section comprises
of the detailed role of cannabinoids in modulation of
tumor proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in various

Cannabinoids modulate the growth of hormone
sensitive breast cancer cells as shown in Fig.3 and 4.
JWH-O15 inhibits hormone sensitive breast cancer
metastasis by modulating CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis
[27, 54]. Endocannabinoids such as anandamide (AEA)
are important lipid ligands regulating cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis. Their levels are regulated
by hydrolase enzymes, the fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). Breast
tumor cells express FAAH abundantly. Inhibition of
FAAH (siRNA-FAAH or FAAH inhibitor URB597)
induced cell death by activating nuclear factor (erythroidderived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant responsive element
(ARE) pathway and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction
and transcription [55]. Anandamide inhibits basal and
nerve growth factor (NGF) induced proliferation of MCF7 and EFM-19 cells in culture through CB1 receptor and
∆9-THC inhibits 17beta-estradiol-induced proliferation of
MCF7 and MCF7-AR1 cells [45, 56-58]. ∆9-THC also
inhibits cell proliferation of ER-/PR+ breast cancer cells.
The effects of anandamide and ∆9-THC were mediated
by blocking transition from one phase of cell cycle to
another, G1-S and G2-M respectively [49, 56, 59-60].
Cell cycle arrest is responsible for apoptotic cell death.
The analog of anandamide, Met-F-AEA reduces MDAMB-231 proliferation by arresting cells in the S phase of
the cell cycle [60]. Anandamide inhibits adenylyl cyclase
(AC) and thus activating the Raf-1/ERK/MAP pathway
in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells whilst THC activates the
transcription factor JunD to finally execute action towards
apoptosis in ER-/PR+ breast cancer cells [49, 56, 59]. One

study shows that anandamide inhibits proliferation of
MDA-MB31 cells by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway [61]. This effect is occurred by inhibition of the
cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 [50, 60].
Synthetic cannabinoids containing naphthoylindole,
JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-122 and JWH-210 and of one
benzoylindole AM-694 shows anti-estrogenic property in
MCF-7 cells [62]. Cannabinoid induced signaling in ER+
breast cancer cells is shown in Fig.3. WIN 55,212-2 and
JWH-133 also produce an inhibition of MDA-MB-231
proliferation by blocking the progression trough the cell
cycle, G1 to S phase transition and induced apoptosis
[26]. The anti-proliferative effect of WIN 55,212-2 and
JWH-133 is validated in both in xenograft-based and
PyMT genetically engineered model of triple-negative
breast cancer modulate through the COX-2/PGE2
signaling pathway [26]. JWH-015 also reduces breast
cancer-induced bone pain, bone loss, and breast cancer
proliferation via cytokine/chemokine suppression.
CBD inhibits AKT and mTOR signaling as well as
decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1,
and cyclin D1. CBD enhances the interaction between
beclin1 and Vps34; it inhibits the association between
beclin1 and Bcl-2 [63]. LPI stimulates proliferation and
this effect was blocked by CBD [53]. Thus, cannabinoids
along with COX-2 inhibitors or other chemotherapeutic
agents may represent as novel chemopreventive tools for
the treatment of breast cancer. Fig.4 shows the effect of
cannabinoids on HER-2 and triple negative breast cancer
pathway.

fragmentation [83]. Recently, we published results on the
role of FAAH in regulating the effects of AEA in NSCLC.
We showed that blocking FAAH increases the levels of
AEA, which in turn inhibits EGFR signaling pathway,
ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [84].
These results generate a rationale for further in vivo
efficacy studies with this compound in preclinical cancer
models.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy
among men of all races and is one of the leading causes
of cancer death in this population. CB1 and CB2
expression levels were higher in prostate cancer tissues
and several cell lines including PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP,
CWR22Rv1, CA-HPV-10 as compared with normal
prostate epithelial cells [45, 64-71]. Moreover, the putative
cannabinoid receptor GPR55 is also expressed in PC-3
and DU-145 cells [72]. ∆9 –THC, WIN-55,212-2, R(+)Methanandamide , Cannabidiol (CBD), Anandamide,
JWH-015, HU120, 2-AG and its stable analogue noladin
have exerted anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-invasive
effects in different prostate cancer cells both in vitro and
in vivo [45, 68-69, 73-77]. ∆9 –THC induced apoptosis via
a receptor-independent manner whilst in another study,
the same group reported that activation of cannabinoid
receptors in PC-3 cells stimulated the PI3K/Akt pathway
with sequential involvement of Raf-1/ERK1/2 and nerve
growth factor induction [66, 68]. Treatment of WIN55,212-2 resulted in sustained activation of ERK1/2
and inhibition of AKT, which was associated with the
induction of phosphatases [74, 78]. CBD also mimicked
the same effect in LNCaP cells as WIN-55,212-2 [78].
The effects of anandamide in LNCaP, DU145, and PC3
cells were mediated through down-regulation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and accumulation of
ceramide [77]. JWH-015 triggered a de novo synthesis
of ceramide, which induced cell death, followed by JNK
(c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation and Akt inhibition
[76]. Effects of R(+)-Methanandamide and JWH-015
were rescued by treatment with SR 144528 in PC-3 cells
[76, 79]. Interestingly, (R)-methanandamide was shown to
have a mitogenic effect on LNCaP cells at very low doses
[46, 75]. FAAH is a serine hydrolase that metabolizes
N-acylethanolamines including AEA, OEA and PEA to
fatty acids plus ethanolamine. A recent report showed that
FAAH is also over-expressed in prostate cancer cells and
the inhibition of FAAH can enhance the survival of cancer
patient [80-81].

Cannabinoids and skin cancer
Melanoma is the mainly cause of skin cancer–related
deaths worldwide. CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed
in normal skin and skin tumors of mice and humans [85].
Activation of CB1/CB2 receptors induced the apoptotic
death of tumorigenic epidermal cells, without affecting the
nontransformed epidermal cells. WIN-55,212-2 or JWH133 induced anti-proliferative effect in epidermal cell lines
(PDV.C57 and HaCa4) and reduces malignant tumors
in nude mice [85]. WIN-55,212-2 or JWH-133 induced
G1 cell cycle arrest on melanoma cells, via inhibition of
p-Akt and hypophosphorylation of the pRb retinoblastoma
protein tumor suppressor [85].

Cannabinoids and pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and
devastating human malignancies. CB1 and CB2 receptors
were expressed in normal and pancreatic cancer tissues,
analyzed by RT-PCR [86]. Cannabinoid receptors on
pancreatic cancer cells may affect prognosis and pain
status of PDAC patients [86]. Cannabinoid administration
leads to apoptosis of pancreatic tumor cells via CB2
receptor and ceramide-dependent up-regulation of p8 and
ATF-4 and TRB3 stress–related genes [87]. Another study
showed that CB1 receptor antagonist AM251–induced
cell death in pancreatic MIAPaCa-2 cells occurred via
receptor-independent manner [88].

Cannabinoids and bone cancer

Cannabinoids and lung cancer

Chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma are the most
frequent primary bone cancers [89]. Bone metastases are
a frequent complication of cancer and the most frequent
type of pain related to cancer. Breast cancer and prostate
cancer mainly metastasize to bone which act as a fertile
soil for the growth of secondary tumors [90]. The skeletal
endocannabinoid system plays a significant role in
regulating bone mass and bone turnover. The expression
levels of CB1 and CB2 receptors were analyzed in
bone cancer patient using immunohistochemistry [91].
Bone metastatic patient has severe pain so cannabinoids
can attenuate pain and hyperalgesia [92]. Sativex is
the combination of delta-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol and

Lung cancer has one of the highest mortality rates
among cancer-suffering patients. Cannabinoids (CBs)
could halt tumor development without side effects via
specific targeting of CB1/CB2 receptor. Studies suggest
the involvement of COX-2 and PPAR-γ in CBD’s
proapoptotic and tumor-regressive action in A549, H460
cells and primary cells from a patient with lung cancer
[82]. Moreover, CBD caused up-regulation of COX2 and PPAR-γ in tumor tissue and tumor regression in
A549-xenografted nude mice [82]. JWH-133 induced
anti-proliferative potential in A549 cell line via DNA

cannabidiol, used to treat pain in cancer [92]. WIN55,2122 induces apoptosis in the NCTC-2472 sarcoma cell line
and AM1241 produced a reduction in bone loss in bone
tumor animal model (NCTC-2472 cell line injected in
to femur of mice) [93-94]. Effects of subcutaneously
administered WIN55,212-2 on weight bearing and
mechanical hyperalgesia were consistent with cannabinoid
receptor mediated anti-nociception [93]. WIN55,212-2
also attenuates tumour-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia
following local (intraplantar) administration through
activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors [95]. Injection of
CP55 940 produced anti-nociceptive properties in the
tail flick test and suppressed mechanical hyperalgesia in
NCTC-2472 or melanoma B16-F10 xenografted bone
tumor model [96]. Indeed, intraplantar administration
of AEA reduces mechanical hyperalgesia, URB597
increases AEA levels and decreases hyperalgesia in a
model of calcaneous bone cancer pain [91]. However,
intrathecal administration of either URB597 or MGL
(URB602) inhibitors failed to produce anti-nociception
when tested for spontaneous flinches, limb use and weight
bearing [97]. Moreover, the CB1 agonist arachidonoyl2-chloroethylamide (ACEA) produces anti–nociceptive
properties following intrathecal administration in this
model; ACEA suppressed spontaneous flinches and
increased limb use and weight bearing [97]. AM1241
produces significantly reduced bone loss and decreased
the incidence of cancer-induced bone fractures [94, 98].
Administration of JWH-015 and AM1241 attenuated
tumor-evoked tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia
by reducing NR2B-dependent activity [98-99]. CB2
agonist, JWH-015 reduced breast cancer induced bone
pain, bone loss, and breast cancer cell proliferation via
cytokine/chemokine suppression in murine mammary cell
line implanted into the femur intramedullary space [100].
JWH-015 increased survival without the major side effects
of current therapeutic options.

∆9-THC and WIN-55,212-2 resulted in sustained activation
of ERK1/2 and inhibition of AKT [104]. Furthermore,
∆9-THC induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor
2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation and thereby activated
an ER stress response that promoted autophagy via tribbles
homolog 3-dependent (TRB3-dependent) inhibition
of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) axis [105]. The activation of this pathway
was necessary for the antitumor action of cannabinoids
in vivo [105]. In contrast to that CBD treatment induces
apoptosis in glioma cells in vitro and tumor regression in
vivo through activation of caspases and reactive oxygen
species via receptor-independent manner Furthermore,
studies revealed that CBD induced TRPV2-dependent
Ca2+ influx which triggers the drug uptake and synergizes
with cytotoxic agents to induce apoptosis of glioma cells
[106]. Authors thought that CBD which do not specifically
interact with CB1/CB2 receptors, can modulate the
activity of ∆9-THC. On that basis Marcu et al determined
the growth inhibitory effect of CBD in combination with
∆9-THC in the U251 and SF126 glioblastoma cell lines
[107]. Furthermore, the combined treatment of Δ9-THC
and temozolomide (TMZ) exert a strong antitumoral
action in glioma xenografts by inducing autophagy
[108]. The submaximal doses of ∆9-THC and CBD in
combination with TMZ produced a strong antitumoral
action in both TMZ-sensitive and TMZ-resistant tumors
[108]. Treatment of KM-233 (novel cannabinoid ligand)
caused a time dependent change in the phosphorylation
profiles of MEK, ERK1/2, Akt, BAD, STAT3, and
p70S6K in U87MG human GBM cells [109]. At 12mg/kg
daily dose of KM-233 for 20 days revealed around 80 %
reduction in tumor size in the orthotopic model of U87MG
[109]. Glioma cells develop resistance to cannabinoid
treatment due to the upregulation of Amphiregulin (EGFR
family ligand) and the growth factor midkine (Mdk)
[110-111]. Amphiregulin expression was associated with
increased ERK activation and Mdk mediated its protective
effect through ALK which interferes with autophagic cell
death [112]. The silencing of amphiregulin and Mdk or
ALK pharmacological inhibition can overcome drug
resistance of glioma to cannabinoids antitumoral action.
Furthermore, to improve the efficacy of cannabinoids
action, microencapsulation methods were used which
facilitates a sustained release of the two cannabinoids for
several days [113]. Administration of CBD- and THCloaded poly-ε-caprolactone microparticles reduced tumor
growth, cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in mice
bearing glioma xenografts with the same efficacy than a
daily local administration of these drugs in solution [113].

Cannabinoids and glioma
Gliomas are the most important group of malignant
primary brain tumors and one of the most aggressive
forms of cancer, exhibit high resistance to conventional
chemotherapies. In glioblastoma endothelial cells, CB1
and CB2 receptors were present in about 38% and 54% of
the cells respectively, analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
CB2 expression levels were higher in glioblastoma tissues
in comparison to CB1. Selective CB2 agonists may
become important targets for the treatment of glioma.
Cannabinoids, inhibit tumor growth in animal models by
inducing apoptosis of tumor cells and impairing tumor
angiogenesis. Administration of ∆9-THC and JWH133 inhibits MMP-2 expression in in vivo model of
glioma [101-103]. The growth inhibitory effect of these
cannabinoids is prevented by blocking ceramide synthesis,
and the expression of the stress protein p8 [102-103]. Both

2. Role of cannabinoids in pro-metastatic
mechanisms like angiogenesis, migration and
invasion

increased apoptosis both in vitro in EL4 and MCL cells and
EL4 tumor bearing mice. In next studies the combination
of ∆9-THC and other cytotoxic agents induced apoptosis
in leukemia cells by MAPK/ERK pathway [114, 116].
In addition R(+)-methanandamide and WIN-55,2122 induced apoptosis in MCL cells, was associated with
ceramide accumulation and p38, depolarization of the
mitochondrial membrane, and caspase activation [117].
R(+)-methanandamide also induced apoptosis in CLL cells
[118]. In contrast, cannabinoids decreased cell viability as
assessed by metabolic activity. The persistent expression
of mammalian homolog of Atg8 with microtubuleassociated protein-1 light chain-3 II (LC3 II) and p62,
as well as the lack of protection from chloroquine,
indicates that lysosomal degradation is not involved in
this cytoplasmic vacuolation process, distinguishing from
classical autophagy [119]. Paraptosis-like cell death-a
third type of a programmed cell death occurred in response
to cannabinoids [119].

Migration and invasion are characteristic features of
cancer cells. Carcinoma cells that are invasive have higher
migratory potential which helps them to disseminate
into the surrounding tissues and spread to other organs,
ultimately leading to metastasis [124]. Angiogenesis,
which involves growth of new vasculature has been shown
to be closely related to cancer metastasis. Developing
novel anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic targets would
be more effective in inhibiting metastasis at earlier stage
[125].
In breast cancer, Met-F-AEA leads to the inhibition
of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and RhoA-ROCK
pathways [126]. JWH-015 reduces CXCL12-induced cell
migration and invasion of a highly metastatic MDA-MB231-derived cell line by inhibiting ERK and cytoskeletal
focal adhesion and stress fiber formation [127]. Novel
synthetic hexahydrocannabinol analogs, LYR-7 and LYR8 reduced tumor growth by targeting VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis signaling in MCF-7 and MCF-7 Tam
resistant cells [128]. Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) inhibits
migration of MDA-MB-231 cells via inhibition of cAMPdependent protein kinase A, coupled with an activation of
the small GTPase, RhoA [129]. Lysophosphatidylinositol
(LPI), the putative endogenous ligand for GPR55, also
stimulates cell migration and invasion in a MDA-MB-231
cell line and its effect is blocked by pretreatment with
cannabidiol (CBD) [53, 130]. Recent study shows that
THC and JWH-133 exert anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic,
anti-angiogenic, and anti-invasive effects in both in vitro
and in vivo models of ErbB-2 breast cancer by modulating
AKT, phospho-S6 ribosomal protein, MMP-2 and MMP-9
expression levels shown in Fig.3 [44, 131-132].
In lung cancer, CBD inhibits invasion of A549 cells
both in vitro and in vivo that was accompanied by upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1
(TIMP-1) and decreased expression of plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) [133-134]. P38 and ERK1/2
were identified as upstream targets for up-regulation of
TIMP-1 [134]. But recent report suggests that CBD
induced TIMP-1 via upregulation of intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [135]. JWH-133 induced antiangiogenic potential in A549 cell line via inhibition of
MMP-2 secretion respectively [83].
In skin cancer, treatment of WIN-55,212-2 or JWH133 caused impairment of tumor vascularization and
decreased expression of proangiogenic factors such as
VEGF, placental growth factor, and angiopoietin-2 [85].
In glioma, [136], one study reveals that CBD also
inhibits angiogenesis by modulating MMP-2 pathway
and Id-1 gene expression in glioblastoma cells [137138]. Administration of CBD- and THC-loaded poly-ε-

Cannabinoids and oral cancer
Oral cancer is mainly occurs in the mouth including
lips, tongue and throat. Smoking, tobacco chewing and
alcohol consumption increases the incidence of oral
cancer. Radiation therapy and surgery is the common
treatment for oral cancer. ∆9-THC induced apoptosis in
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a malignant form
of oral cancer [120].

Cannabinoids and head and neck cancer
Marijuana smoking increases the incidence of
head and neck cancer in young people but its constituent,
cannabinoids have anti-tumor properties. One study
reports that moderate marijuana use is associated with
reduced risk of HNSCC [121].

Cannabinoids and thyroid carcinoma
Thyroid carcinoma is the most aggressive form
which occurs in thyroid gland. IL-12 gene transfer in to
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line (ARO) has antitumorigenic effect [122]. This effect was observed due to
the activation of cannabinoid receptor. Furthermore they
have reported that CB2 agonist JWH-133 and CB1/CB2
agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced apoptosis in ARO and
ARO/IL-12 cells [122]. 2-methyl-2’-F-anandamide (MetF-AEA) also induced apoptosis in thyroid carcinoma cells
via activation of p53 and p21 mediated pathway [123].

5. Role of cannabinoids in energy metabolism and
cancer

caprolactone microparticles reduced tumor growth and
angiogenesis in mice bearing glioma xenografts with the
same efficacy than a daily local administration of these
drugs in solution [113].

One of the important by-products in energy
metabolism is a set of compounds called Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS) which is produced from mitochondria and
consists of H2O2, superoxide O2-, hydroxyl radical O2-,
etc. Increased ROS production has been associated with
triggering of apoptosis [149]. CBD modulates ERK and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways, which lead to
down-regulation of Id-1 expression. Id-1, an inhibitor of
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, has recently
been shown to be a key regulator of the metastatic
potential of breast and additional cancers [141-142].
Arachidonoyl cyclopropamide (ACPA) or GW405833
(GW) induced AMPK mediated autophagy in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells is strictly related to the inhibition
of energy metabolism through a ROS-dependent increase
of the AMP/ATP ratio [150]. The combination of
cannabinoids and gemcitabine, a nucleoside analogue used
in cancer chemotherapy, synergistically inhibit pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell growth by a ROS-mediated
autophagy induction without affecting normal fibroblasts
[151]. Cannabidiol (CBD)-induced endoplasmic reticulum
stress mediated cell death of MDA-MB231 breast cancer
cells, with the coexistence of autophagy and apoptosis
[63]. Recently one published report shows that ∆9-THC
and ∆8-THC inhibited mitochondrial oxygen consumption
rate via receptor independent manner in oral cancer
cells [152]. In primary lymphocytes, treatment with
CBD induced caspase 8 induced apoptosis which was
mediated by oxidative stress. Similar result has been
reported in glioma cells where CBD causes oxidative
stress and higher enzymatic activities of glutathione
reductase and glutathione peroxidase. In NSCLC cell
line H460, agonists AEA, THC and HU-210 modulated
the activity of mitochondrial complexes I and II-III,
decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential. ∆9THC and cannabidiol acted synergistically to inhibit cell
proliferation, modulations of the cell cycle and induction
of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis as well as
specific modulations of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase and caspase activities in glioblastoma [107]. KM233 induced mitochondrial depolarization, cleaved caspase
3, significant cytoskeletal contractions, and redistribution
of the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum structures in U87MG
human GBM cells [109].

3. Role of cannabinoids in cancer metastasis
Met-F-AEA, WIN 55,212-2, JWH-133 and
JWH-015 inhibit the migration and invasion of MDAMB231 breast cancer cells to distant sites such as lung
[27, 50, 126, 139-140]. CBD inhibits cell proliferation
and invasion of 4T1 cells (mammary metastatic cell
line) and reduces primary tumor volume as well as
lung metastasis in 4T1-xenografted orthotopic model
of nude mice [141-142]. This anti-metastatic effect was
mediated by downregulation of Id-1 (a basic helix-loophelix transcription factor inhibitor), ERK and also by
inhibiting the ROS pathway. Furthermore, CBD reduced
the number of metastatic foci in 4T1- tail vein injected
syngenic model. In lung cancer, JWH-015 and Win55,2122 inhibit in vitro chemotaxis, chemoinvasion and in
vivo tumor growth and lung metastasis via inhibition of
AKT, matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression (MMP-9),
but the pretreatment of CB1/CB2 selective antagonists,
AM251 and AM630 antagonized their effects [143]. ∆9THC inhibits growth of Lewis lung adenocarcinoma via
inhibition of DNA synthesis and it suppresses growth and
metastasis of A549 and SW-1573 (human lung cancer
cell lines) both in vitro and in vivo due to inhibition of
epidermal growth factor–induced phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, c-Jun-NH2-kinase1/2 and Akt [144-145].

4. Role of cannabinoids in stemness and cancer
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are part of the tumor cell
population. Though they might be very less in number,
they have the ability to self renew and replicate to produce
enormous cancer cell types. CSCs have been shown to
be drug resistant with higher invasive and metastatic
potential [146]. Studies show that cannabinoid receptors
are involved in differentiation of neural progenitors from
ectoderm and hematopoietic progenitors from mesoderm.
CB1 and CB2 receptor activation modulate proliferation
and differentiation of daughter progenitors. CannabinoidsHU210, WIN55,212-2, AEA and methAEA induced
concentration dependent cytotoxicity in P19 embryonal
carcinoma (EC) cells [147]. It involved partial regulation
by cannabinoid receptors leading to oxidative stress,
necrosis coupled with apoptosis. Both CB1 and CB2
receptors are expressed in glioma stem like cells (GSC).
HU-210 and JWH-133 helped in neural differentiation of
GSC and blocked GSC mediated gliomagenesis [148].
These open further investigation on the function of
cannabinoids and the link between stem cell and tumor
progression.

6. Role of cannabinoids in immune environment
and cancer
Cancer is a type of inflammatory disease, where
immune cells infiltrate into the tumor site and secrete
factors which enhance the prospects of proliferation,
angiogenesis and metastasis [153]. Hence, it is important
5863

Oncotarget

to identify anti-cancer agents that target the immune
related cancer environment. In glioma, WIN-55,212-2
caused accumulation of ceramide which is essential for
cell death and it also had anti-inflammatory effects [154].
WIN55,212-2, abolished the PGN-activated cell growth
which activates a number of inflammatory pathways,
including NF-κB (aggravates tumors) and this effect
was reversed by CB1 antagonist AM281 but not by the
CB2 antagonist, AM630 [155]. Anandamide reduces
proliferation and production of cytokines like IL-2,
TNF-α and INF-γ in human T lymphocytes by activating
CB2 receptor [156]. In astrocytoma and glioblastoma
cells, WIN55,212-2 inhibited IL-1 mediated activation
of adhesion molecules and chemokines like ICAM-1,
VCAM-I and IL-8, which was receptor independent [157].
In murine T cells, cannabinol decreased IL-2 production
by inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) [158]. In CD8+ T
lymphocytes, JWH-133 downregulated SDF-1 induced m
migration in CB2 receptor dependent manner [159].

CONCLUSIONS
DIRECTIONS

AND

understanding of the role of cannabinoids with respect
to the tumor and its microenvironment. The diversity of
affecting multiple signaling pathways might pave way
for developing cannabinoids that selectively obstruct a
particular pathway, thus opening avenues for specific
targeted treatments.
Moreover, cannabinoids are more specific to cancer
cells than normal cells. The administration of single
cannabinoids might produce limited relief compared to
the administration of crude extract of plant containing
multiple cannabinoids, terpenes and flavanoids. Thus,
combination of cannabinoids with other chemotherapeutic
drugs might provide a potent clinical outcome, reduce
toxicity, increase specificity and overcome drug resistance
complications. Additional findings in in vitro and in vivo
models are needed to support studies at preclinical setting.

FUTURE

Cannabinoids exert a direct anti-proliferative effect
on tumors of different origin. They have been shown to
be anti-migratory and anti-invasive and inhibit MMPs
which in turn degrade the extra-cellular matrix (ECM),
thus affecting metastasis of cancer to the distant organs.
Also, cannabinoids modulate other major processes
in our body like energy metabolism, inflammation,
etc. These data are derived not only from cell culture
systems but also from more complex and clinically
relevant animal models. Before cannabinoids could
be used in clinical trials, there is need to explore more
knowledge on several issues such as anti-tumorigenic
and anti-metastatic mechanisms as well as which type
of cancer patient populations would be more responsive
for cannabinoid based therapies. Data presented in this
review suggest that cannabinoids derived from different
sources regulate differently signaling pathways, modulate
different tumor cell types and host physiological system.
It is important to understand which of the cannabinoid
receptors are expressed and activated in different
tumors as each receptor follows a different signaling
mechanism. Furthermore, endocannabinoids- AEA and
2-AG are broken down into secondary metabolites like
prostaglandin (PGE2) and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid
(EE) which enhance tumor growth and metastasis in
diverse cancer types. Understanding the exact signaling
by which cannabinoids function will eventually lead to
targeted clinical approach. Also, the difference in cellular
response to cannabinoids in different cancer types might
be due to the effect of the tumor environment which
involves inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells,
macrophages, etc. Thus, there is a need for an integrative
