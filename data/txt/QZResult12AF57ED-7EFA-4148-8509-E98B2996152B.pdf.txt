Abstract
Current drug therapy for metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) results in temporary disease control but not
cure, necessitating continued investigation into alternative mechanistic approaches. Drugs that inhibit
chromatin-modifying enzymes involved in transcription repression (chromatin-relaxing drugs) could have a
role, by inducing apoptosis and/or through differentiation pathways. At low doses, the cytosine analogue
decitabine (DAC) can be used to deplete DNA methyl-transferase 1 (DNMT1), modify chromatin, and alter
differentiation without causing apoptosis (cytotoxicity). Noncytotoxic regimens of DAC were evaluated for in
vitro and in vivo efficacy against RCC cell lines, including a p53-mutated RCC cell line developed from a
patient with treatment-refractory metastatic RCC. The cell division–permissive mechanism of action—
absence of early apoptosis or DNA damage, increase in expression of HNF4a (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a), a
key driver associated with the mesenchymal to epithelial transition, decrease in mesenchymal marker
expression, increase in epithelial marker expression, and late increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
CDKN1B (p27) protein—was consistent with differentiation-mediated cell-cycle exit. In vivo blood counts and
animal weights were consistent with minimal toxicity of therapy. The distinctive mechanism of action of a
dose and schedule of DAC designed for noncytotoxic depletion of DNMT1 suggests a potential role in treating
RCC. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1431–41. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Therapy targeted at VEGF and mTOR pathways now represents the standard of care in metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC;
reviewed in ref. 1). Typically, resistance develops to treatment
after 6 to 15 months (1). Although the mechanisms by which
VEGF and mTOR pathway inhibitors produce temporary
disease control are not completely understood, these agents
may exercise much of their antitumor activity by antagonizing
HIF-1a–mediated proangiogenic effects (1). Drugs with a
different mechanism of action could complement these existing therapies to extend the period of disease control.
Agents that inhibit chromatin-modifying enzymes involved
in transcription repression (chromatin-relaxing drugs) could
have a role in treating RCC (2–4; reviewed in ref. 5). A number
of downstream pathways have been implicated in mediating
the anti-RCC effects of these drugs (2–5). Broadly speaking,

the antiproliferative effect could be mediated by apoptosis
pathways and/or by differentiation pathways. Effects of some
classes of chromatin-relaxing drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors that are not restricted to inhibition of chromatin-modifying enzymes have been suggested to mediate
antitumor effects by both apoptotic and differentiation pathways. Although the cytosine analogue decitabine (DAC), which
depletes DNA methyl-transferase 1 (DNMT1), can also cause
both apoptosis and alter differentiation (6) at low doses, DAC
can be used to modify chromatin (7) and alter differentiation
without cytotoxicity (8–11). However, DAC has not been
evaluated in vitro and in vivo against RCC at a dose and
schedule designed and verified for noncytotoxic DNMT1
depletion, even though the ability of DAC to activate expression of various methylated or immune-related genes in RCC
cells has been evaluated (2–4, 12). Furthermore, the possible
role of mesenchymal to epithelial differentiation in mediating
cell-cycle exit in response to DAC treatment has not been
studied. Reasons for evaluating a noncytotoxic DAC regimen
in RCC include the likelihood of less toxicity to normal stem
cells (low concentrations of DAC increase normal hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal; refs. 13–16), which could
facilitate increased exposure to therapy (an important consideration with this S-phase-specific agent), and differentiation–mediated cell-cycle exit, which could be p53independent and mechanistically distinct from existing therapy (the p53 pathway is frequently suppressed in malignant
cells, including renal cancer cells; refs. 17, 18).
Therefore, noncytotoxic regimens of DAC were evaluated
for in vitro and in vivo effects in normal kidney epithelial cells

and RCC cell lines, including a TP53-mutated RCC cell line
developed from a patient with treatment refractory metastatic
RCC. The expression of genes and proteins was examined in
the treated cells to understand the pathway and mechanism
for cell-cycle exit and to distinguish between apoptosis- and
differentiation-based mechanisms. Blood counts and animal
weights were used to assess toxicity of in vivo therapy. The
results and mechanism of action information from these
studies provide support for a mechanistically distinct
approach to RCC therapy.

Materials and Methods
Derivation and culture of the Ren-01 cell line
A 2-mm diameter biopsy sample from a patient with sunitinib- and bevacizumab-resistant metastatic RCC was
implanted subcutaneously into the flank of an athymic nu/
nu mouse. Over 4 weeks, the tumor grew to 10-mm diameter.
The tumor was passaged serially into 2 additional mice. Tumor
cells were dissociated in vitro, and a cell line (Ren-01) was
established. The line could be cryopreserved and thawed and
remained tumorigenic. Ren-01 were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin), initially seeding 1 
105 cells per well in 6-well plates (1 mL of medium per well).
Cells were treated with DAC on day 1. Medium was changed
every 2 days. Cells were split at 70% confluence with trypsin/
EDTA, using standard protocols, followed by reseeding of the
appropriate volume of cells. The cells used in these experiments were passaged 5 to 7 times.
Culture of other RCC cell lines
The RCC cell lines SK-RC-29, SK-RC-45, ACHN, and RENCA
were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS at 37 C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air. SK-RC-29 and
SK-RC-45 cell lines were gifts from Dr. N.H. Banker at The New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (19). The ACHN cell line
was established in our laboratory (20). RENCA were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection.
Derivation and culture of normal kidney epithelial cells
Kidney epithelial cells were isolated from surgical specimens obtained from patients undergoing nephrectomy for
renal carcinoma. A 10-mm fragment of normal renal tissue
was manually dissociated by mincing the fragment with
scalpels while submerged in 10-mL medium in a 10-cm dish.
Resultant cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS at
37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air. After cell
expansion for 1 week, aliquots of primary cells were frozen in
liquid nitrogen for later use. The kidney epithelial cells generated in this manner are nonimmortalized, nontumorigenic
in nude mice and senesce after 20 to 30 passages.
Sequencing of TP53
PCR primers were designed to amplify all coding exons 3 to
11 and mRNA open reading frame sequence of TP53
(NM_000546.4). Genomic DNA and first-strand cDNA were
used as templates for PCR amplification. Bidirectional sequen-

cing was done using ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). Primer sequences are given in Supplementary
Table S1. Seqman software was used to analyze the sequences
(DNASTAR)
In vitro treatment of cells with DAC
DAC stock solution (5 mmol/L) was generated by reconstituting lyophilized DAC in 100% methanol. Stock solution
aliquots were stored at 80 C for up to 3 weeks. Working
solution was generated by diluting the stock solution 1:100 in
PBS, immediately before addition to the cells at a further
dilution as per the intended final concentration. Similar
amounts of methanol are added to untreated control cells.
Cells were treated with DAC (0.5 mmol/L) on days 1, 4, and 7 of
culture.
Immunofluorescence to measure DNMT1 levels and
examine nuclear chromatin
Cells on cytospin slides were fixed and permeabilized with
10% formalin and 0.25% triton. Nonspecific binding sites
were blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 6% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). Slides were incubated overnight with
mouse anti-DNMT1 antibody (Abcam; catalogue no.
ab13537, diluted 1:500 in blocking solution), followed by a
655-nm Quantum Dots-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen; catalogue no. Q11022MP, diluted 1:500).
Finally, cells were stained with 3 mmol/L 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 minutes before dehydration in
graded alcohols and xylene.
DNA damage measurement by gH2AX staining
Phosphorylation of the histone H2A family member H2AX
at Ser139 (gH2AX) was measured by flow cytometry. Cells
were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized by adding ice-cold 90% methanol solution. Cells were
then incubated in blocking solution (0.5% BSA) containing
saturating concentration of Alexa 488–conjugated gH2AX
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; catalogue no. 9719).
Percentage of gH2AX-positive cells is analyzed with a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer equipped with CXP software (Beckman-Coulter).
Apoptosis detection
Apoptosis was detected by Annexin-V and 7AAD costaining, using the APOAF commercial kit (Sigma). Cells (5  105),
were washed and incubated for 30 minutes with fluorescein
isothiocyanate–conjugated Annexin-V at room temperature.
Cells were then resuspended in 400 mL of binding
buffer containing 7AAD and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry.
PKH67 methods
PKH67 staining was carried out following the labeling
procedure provided by the manufacturer (Sigma). Briefly,
107 cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin, washed once with
RPMI 1640/10% FBS, and resuspended at the concentration of
2  107/mL in diluent C. The cell suspension was gently mixed
with 1 mL of a 20 mmol/L PKH67 solution and incubated for

3 minutes at room temperature. Staining was stopped by the
addition of an equal volume (2 mL) of RPMI 1640/1% BSA for
1 minute. To remove the excessive dye, cells were washed
3 times and then either analyzed by flow cytometry (day 0) or
replated in RPMI 1640/10% FBS for further analysis at indicated times (days 1, 2, and 3).
Quantitative real-time PCR
mRNA levels were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) by standard methods. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase was amplified as control. Primer sequences are
given in Supplementary Table S1. Real-time detection of the
emission intensity of SYBR Green bound to double-stranded
DNA was detected using the iCycler instrument (Bio-Rad).
Data were reported as "relative expression value," which was
determined by raising 2 to the power of the negative value of
DDCT for each sample.
One-dimensional SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Approximately 50 mg of protein extracts, together with
molecular weight markers, was subjected to one-dimensional
(1D) SDS-PAGE on 4% to 12% gradient gels (Invitrogen). After
electrophoresis per manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen), proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore) at 35 constant voltage for 1 hour, using
Invitrogen's semidry blotting apparatus. Western analyses of
PVDF membranes utilized established protocols and antibodies for p15 (Cell Signaling; catalogue no. 4822), p21 (Cell
Signaling; catalogue no. 2946), p27 (Cell Signaling; catalogue
no. 3686), p57 (Cell Signaling; catalogue no. 2557), p-p53 (Cell
Signaling; catalogue no. 92865), p53 (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue
no. P6874), DNMT1 (Abcam; catalogue no. Ab54759), and anti–
b-actin peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue no. A3854).
Murine xenograft and in vivo therapy with DAC
All experiments were approved by the Cleveland Clinic
Institution Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and
followed approved procedures. Nude mice were inoculated
subcutaneously (right and left flanks) with 1  106 Ren-01
cells in 200-mL sterile vehicle. Nine days after inoculation
(day 9), mice were initiated on treatment (4 mice each per
treatment group) with 0.2 mg/kg DAC administered subcutaneously 3 days per week, sunitinib [a multi-kinase
(including VEGF pathway) inhibitor that is standard of care
for metastatic RCC] 40 mg/kg administered by oral gavage
daily 5 days per week, the combination of DAC and sunitinib,
or mock treated with PBS administered subcutaneously. Size
of the xenograft was recorded twice a week with an electronic caliper, and volume was estimated using the following
equation: volume (mm3) ¼ long (mm)  wide (mm2)/2. Mice
developing tumors of more than 2,000 mm3 in size or
showing signs of distress or necropsy in any area of the
xenograft were euthanized for humanitarian reasons, using
CO2 inhalation and followed by cervical dislocation. Tumor
was harvested from the euthanized rodents for further
analysis. The experiment was terminated when the mice
from any experimental group were completely euthanized.
Similar procedures were followed for experiments using

RENCA, with the following differences: the inoculum consisted of 3  106 RENCA cells. DAC treatment was initiated
3 days after the inoculation with tumor cells. Sunitinib was
not used a treatment regimen.
Correlation of KI67 gene expression with GI50
Quality controlled raw data (Affymetrix CEL files or SOFT
files) from previously published experiments [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Datasets GSE5846; ref. 21] were downloaded from GEO datasets (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). KI67
gene expression data in 8 renal cancer cell lines (786-0, A498,
ACHN, CAKI-1, RXF 393, SN12C, TK-10, and UO-31) were
correlated with GI50 (the concentration of DAC that produced
50% growth inhibition) data from the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI;
http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/index.html; ref. 22). SAS statistical analysis software was used to generate scatter plots and Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients.
Cytospin and Giemsa staining
For morphology evaluation, the renal cancer cell lines were
treated with 0.5 mmol/L DAC at day 1 and day 4 and harvested
at day 7. Slides were spun down onto slides with a Shandon
CytoSpin III cytocentrifuge (Thermo Scientific) at 500 rpm for
5 minutes. After air drying, cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 1 minute and then Giemsa stained: Giemsa staining
stock solution was diluted with PBS (pH 6.5) at a ratio of 1:10,
and the diluted Giemsa solution was added to cells for 30
minutes at room temperature. After rinsing and mounting of
cover-slips, cell morphology was evaluated using an Olympus
light microscope and CCD camera.
PCR and pyrosequencing assay for LINE-1 methylation
Genomic DNA was isolated from RENCA tumor explants
with the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega;
catalogue no. A1125) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bisulfite conversion of the genomic DNA was done using
the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research; catalogue no.
D5001) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Murine
LINE-1 CpG methylation status was determined by pyrosequencing on the Qiagen PyroMark Q24 using PyroMark Gold
Q24 reagents (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence and methylation status analyses were
done using the PyroMark Q24 version 1.0.10 software in the
CpG (methylation) analysis mode. mouse LINE-1 forward
primer: TGGGATTTTAAGATTTTTGGTGAG; reverse primer:
CTTCCCTATTTACCACAATCTCAA (amplicon size 86 bp),
annealing temperature: 60 C. Sequencing primer: TTTTTGGTGAGTGGAATATA (23). The amount of C divided by
the sum of the amounts of C and T at each CpG site was
calculated as percentage (i.e., multiplied by 100).
Statistical analysis
Student's t test was used to compare mean cell counts and
relative expression values. Statistical comparisons involving
more than 2 groups were carried out by 1-way ANOVA, with
Dunnett multiple comparisons as post hoc test. Differences
were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Results
DAC (0.5 mmol/L) depletes DNMT1 in Ren-01 cells
without causing measurable DNA damage, apoptosis, or
senescence
DAC is a cytosine analogue; therefore, as per the class
effect of nucleoside analogues, it can induce DNA damage
and cytotoxicity. However, the sugar backbone of DAC is
unmodified, and DAC is rapidly cleaved and degraded by
hydrolysis (24). Hence, DAC is substantially less efficient at
impeding DNA replication machinery and terminating DNA
strand elongation than an equimolar concentration of cytosine arabinoside (AraC), a cytosine analogue with prominent
cytotoxic effects (8, 9). Here, to support a noncytotoxic
DNMT1 depletion-based (and hence epigenetic) mechanism
of action when low concentrations of DAC are used, we
evaluated DNMT1 depletion, DNA damage, apoptosis, and
senescence induction in RCC cells treated with DAC. Equimolar concentrations of the DNA-damaging cytosine analogue cytarabine (AraC) was used as a control in these

experiments, because DAC and AraC are transported into
cells and metabolized identically to generate nucleotide
analogues that can incorporate into DNA.
DNMT1 was quantified in Ren-01 cells 48 hours after treatment with 0.5 mmol/L DAC. This concentration of DAC produced a substantial decrease in DNMT1 levels (Fig. 1A).
Twenty-four hours after equimolar DAC or AraC treatment,
cells were harvested for flow cytometric measurement of
phospho-H2AX levels as an index of DNA damage/repair. AraC
produced a large increase in phospho-H2AX levels (Fig. 1B). In
contrast, equimolar DAC did not significantly increase phospho-H2AX levels (Fig. 1B). Apoptosis is associated with cell
surface staining with Annexin-V. AraC treatment increased
Annexin-V staining of Ren-01 cells (measured by flow cytometry 24 hours after drug treatment; Fig. 1C). In contrast, DACtreated cells did not show an increase in Annexin-V staining
(Fig. 1C). Another mechanism for cell-cycle exit is senescence,
which is associated with distinctive patterns of chromatin
clumping (25). DAC treatment of normal human fibroblasts
induced chromatin changes associated with senescence

Figure 1. Administration of 0.5 mmol/L DAC depletes DNMT1 in Ren-01 cells without causing significant DNA damage or apoptosis. A, DNMT1 depletion
in Ren-01 cells treated with 0.5 mmol/L DAC. Ren-01 cells (low passage number RCC cells) at less than 40% confluence were treated with 0.5 mmol/L DAC.
DNMT1 was quantified 48 hours later by immunofluorescence (green dots). DAPI was used to stain nuclei (blue stain). B, this concentration did not produce
measurable DNA damage in Ren-01 cells. Twenty-four hours after DAC or AraC exposure, DNA damage was measured by flow cytometric assessment
for phosphorylation of histone H2AX. Equimolar levels of AraC were used as positive control. Grey histogram, isotype control. C, 0.5 mmol/L DAC did
not produce early apoptosis in Ren-01 cells. Twenty-four hours after the addition of 0.5 mmol/L DAC or AraC, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric
assessment for Annexin-V/7AAD staining of exposed phosphatidyl serine. D, DAC produced chromatin changes associated with senescence in normal
fibroblasts but not in Ren-01 cells. Normal human fibroblasts, but not Ren-01 cells, treated with DAC undergo clumping changes in chromatin associated
with senescence (25).

(Fig. 1D). These chromatin changes were not seen in Ren-01
cells treated with DAC (Fig. 1D).
DAC, at concentrations that depleted DNMT1 without
causing measurable DNA damage or apoptosis,
decreased proliferation of RCC cells accompanied by
gene and protein expression changes of epithelial and
terminal differentiation
Gene expression and pathomorphologic observations suggest that RCC cells may have an abnormal mesenchymal
differentiation level (26–28). One potential mechanism of
action by which chromatin-relaxing drugs may terminate
proliferation of renal cancer cells is through restoration of
more normal differentiation patterns, which would be
expected to be accompanied by a decrease in mesenchymal
markers and an increase in epithelial markers.

Early-passage normal kidney epithelial cells, the freshly
derived RCC cell line Ren-01 [a p53 mutated (Supplementary
Fig. S1) cell line derived from a patient with treatment
refractory RCC], and the established RCC cell lines SK-RC29, SK-RC-45, and ACHN were either treated with the concentration of DAC that depleted DNMT1 without causing
measurable apoptosis on days 1 and 4 or mock treated with
PBS. Normal kidney epithelial cells treated with DAC continued to proliferate in a manner similar to the vehicle-treated
control (Fig. 2A). In contrast, DAC treatment decreased the
rate of proliferation in the RCC cell lines (Fig. 2A).
In the normal kidney epithelial cells (Fig. 2B), DAC treatment did not produce a significant change in the gene
expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a), a key
DNA-binding transcription factor associated with mesenchymal to epithelial transition (29), or in the expression of
the kidney epithelial markers cytokeratin 7 (CK7), epithelial
cadherin (E-cadherin), and kidney-specific cadherin (KSPcadherin). Expression of the mesenchymal marker fibronectin
was increased, with a small increase in expression of the
mesenchymal marker Snail (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in the
RCC cell lines, DAC treatment increased expression of
the mesenchymal to epithelial differentiation driver HNF4a,
increased expression of the epithelial markers CK7, E-cadherin in 3 of 4 cell lines, and KSP-cadherin, and decreased
expression of the mesenchymal markers Snail in 2 of 4 cell
lines (Fig. 2B). The decrease in fibronectin levels was not
statistically significant (Fig. 2B). Cells harvested on day 7 were
stained with Giemsa to facilitate morphologic examination.
Normal kidney epithelial cells treated with DAC resembled
vehicle-treated cells. However, RCC cell lines (SK-RC-29, SKRC-45, ANHC, and Ren-O1) treated with DAC showed
increased size, decreased nucleocytoplasmic ratio, and
increased eosinophilic staining of the cytoplasm compared
with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3).

Noncytotoxic RCC Therapy

The gene expression changes suggest that the decrease in
proliferation in the RCC cell lines could be mediated by
epithelial differentiation–associated cell-cycle exit. Key components of the apoptosis and differentiation pathways
that mediate cell-cycle exit have been described. Apoptosis
induced by antimetabolite chemotherapy is associated with
the phosphorylation of p53 serine-15 and the upregulation of
p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21/CDKN1A and
p16/CDKN2A (30–38). Differentiation–mediated cell-cycle
exit is associated with the upregulation of p57/CDKN1C
and p27/CDKN1B (39–42). Protein levels of these key mediators of apoptotic and differentiation cell-cycle exit were
examined in Ren-01 cells at various time points (48–120 hours)
after treatment with DAC or 0.5 mmol/L AraC.
With regard to apoptosis-associated events, AraC but not
DAC produced a significant increase in serine-15 phosphorylation of p53 and levels of total p53 (Fig. 4). Both DAC and
AraC increased p21/CDKN1A levels, with a larger increase
produced by AraC (Fig. 4). p16/CDKN2A protein was not
detected in Ren-01 cells despite using 2 separate antibody
clones for detection (Fig. 4).
With regard to differentiation-associated events, only DAC
but not AraC increased levels of p27/CDKN1B, with the
increase most prominent at late time points (Fig. 4). AraC

decreased p57/CDKN1C levels (Fig. 4). p57/CDKN1C levels
were unaffected by DAC treatment (Fig. 4). Neither AraC nor
DAC affected p15/CDKN2B levels (Fig. 4). DAC but not AraC
decreased levels of DNMT1 (Fig. 4).
Levels of DNMT1 and the above-mentioned apoptosis and
differentiation proteins were also examined in murine RCC
cells (RENCA) treated with DAC or AraC. As per Ren-01, the
most prominent observation was DNMT1 depletion and p27/
CDKN1B upregulation at late time points in DAC-treated cells
but not in AraC-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
DAC-treated Ren-01 cells undergo temporary cell-cycle
arrest and then resume cell division unlike AraCtreated cells which do not divide after treatment
The late upregulation of p27/CDKN1B suggests that cellcycle exit after DAC treatment may be a late effect, with Ren01 cells undergoing 1 or more cell divisions after DAC treatment before eventual differentiation–mediated cell-cycle exit
unlike the immediate cell-cycle exit associated with apoptosisbased therapy.
Ren-01 cell membranes were stained with the fluorescent
marker PHK67 prior to mmol/L DAC or AraC 0.5 treatment.
This cell surface stain is diluted on the cell surface corresponding to the number of cell divisions. Compared with

Figure 5. DAC-treated Ren-01
cells undergo temporary
cell-cycle arrest and then resume
cell division unlike AraC-treated
cells which do not divide after
treatment. Cell membranes were
stained with PHK67 prior to DAC
or AraC treatment. Left shift in
signal corresponds to cell division
with a consequent decrease in
stain intensity on individual
daughter cells. DAC and AraC
treatment one-time addition of
0.5 mmol/L.

PBS-treated control, DAC produced a temporary cell-cycle
arrest, followed by a resumption in cell division (Fig. 5). In
contrast, AraC induced cell-cycle arrest from which the Ren-01
cells did not recover (Fig. 5).

Sensitivity of renal cancer cell lines to DAC inversely
correlates with the proliferative index
Because DAC is S-phase specific, sensitivity to DAC may
depend on the proliferative index of RCC cells. In 8 RCC cell

lines (786-0, A498, ACHN, CAKI-1, RXF 393, SN12C, TK-10, and
UO-31), the DAC GI50 [GI50 data from the Developmental
Therapeutics Program of the NCI (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/
index.html) and gene expression data from GEO data sets
GSE5846; ref. 21] inversely correlated with the expression of
KI67 (a proliferation marker expressed only in cycling cells;
KI67 expression is widely used in clinical pathology as an
index of proliferation in tumor tissue; ref. 22; Supplementary
Fig. S3).
A noncytotoxic dose and schedule of DAC was well
tolerated and decreased tumor volume in xenografted
mice
The in vitro observations suggest that a DAC dose intended
for noncytotoxic DNMT1 depletion could be efficacious therapy. The sensitivity of DAC to the proliferative index suggests
the importance of maximizing time of exposure (to increase
the fraction of cancer cells that undergo cell division in the
presence of DAC). The lower dose of DAC used for noncytotoxic DNMT1 depletion may allow relatively frequent administration to increase time of exposure (3 times per week).
Although low-dose DAC can be noncytotoxic, temporary cellcycle arrest (cytostasis) is likely still produced. Daily administration could prolong cytostasis and thereby cause or exacerbate cytopenia. Nondaily, but relatively frequent, 1 to 3 times
per week, administration is a stratagem to maximize cumulative exposure while minimizing consequences of cytostasis
such as cytopenia. Similarly, subcutaneous administration
may produce lower peak levels but extend the duration of
exposure compared with intraperitoneal administration of
DAC. These principles were tested using a xenograft model
of human RCC.
Nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously (right and left
flanks) with 1  106 Ren-01 cells. Nine days after inoculation,
mice were initiated on treatment with 0.2 mg/kg DAC administered subcutaneously 3 times per week, sunitinib [a multikinase (including VEGF pathway) inhibitor that is a standard
of care for metastatic RCC] 40 mg/kg administered by oral
gavage daily 5 times per week, the combination of DAC and
sunitinib, or mock treated with PBS administered subcutaneously (4 mice each per treatment group).
This regimen of DAC did not induce measurable DNA
damage in the bone marrow of DAC-treated mice (measured
by flow cytometric assessment of phospho-H2AX levels;
Fig. 6A). Murine weights in DAC- and sunitinib-treated mice
were similar and decreased, but not to significant extent,
compared with PBS-treated mice. The largest decrease in
murine weights was seen in mice treated with the combination of DAC and sunitinib (Fig. 6B). No substantial differences
in white blood cell, platelet, or hemoglobin levels were noted
between the different treatment groups, although there was a
trend toward higher platelet counts in mice receiving DAC
(Fig. 6B, increases in platelet counts are noted with low-dose
DAC clinical therapy; ref. 10). The greatest decrease in tumor
volume was produced by treatment with DAC (Fig. 6C). On
day 25 (after 2 weeks of treatment), the tumor volume in DAC,
sunitinib, and combination treated mice was significantly
decreased compared with PBS-treated control mice (P values

www.aacrjournals.org

0.003, 0.028, and 0.048, respectively). Tumor explants were
fixed and embedded in paraffin and evaluated histologically by
hematoxylin and eosin staining. DAC treatment was associated with more extensive necrosis than treatment with
sunitinib or the combination (Fig. 6C).
The DAC regimen produced similar results when a different
RCC cell line was used: nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 3  106 RENCA cells. Subcutaneous administration of 0.2 mg/kg DAC 3 times per week or PBS mock
treatment was initiated on day 3. In vehicle-treated mice,
there was an exponential increase in tumor volume requiring
early sacrifice of the mice (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In DACtreated mice, there was a substantially slower early increase in
tumor volume, followed by no further tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In a parallel experiment, RENCA tumor was
explanted on day 21 from 2 vehicle and 2 DAC-treated mice for
evaluation of tumor DNMT1 by Western blot and DNA
methylation by LINE-1 pyrosequencing. Compared with
explants from vehicle-treated mice, DNMT1 and DNA methylation levels were substantially decreased in explants from
DAC-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2D).

Discussion
Both Wilms’ and non-Wilms’ tumor renal cancer cells have
gene expression profiles, with features of mesenchymal differentiation instead of normal epithelial differentiation (26–28).
This suggests an RCC model in which the self-renewal that
drives expansion of the malignant clone derives from abnormal persistence, or acquisition of, an immature mesenchymal
program (reviewed in ref. 43). A corollary of this model is
abnormal repression of the epithelial differentiation program.
Repression of the epithelial differentiation program could be
mediated epigenetically, even if genetic events are the
upstream triggers for abnormal differentiation. Supporting
a role for aberrant epigenetic repression in RCC oncogenesis,
mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes that create epigenetic activation marks are a feature of RCC (44). The
observations here, in which noncytotoxic DNMT1 depleting
concentrations of DAC increased epithelial marker expression, decreased mesenchymal marker expression and
increased expression of p27/CDKN1B protein, the CDKN
family member with a well-documented role in mediating
cell-cycle exit with differentiation (39–42), are consistent with
this model of RCC oncogenesis.
This noncytotoxic epigenetic approach to therapy could
complement existing therapy in a number of ways. Noncytotoxic DNMT1 depletion with DAC increases normal hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and is well tolerated, even in
subjects with comorbidities (10, 13–16, 45). The mechanism of
action is likely to be distinct from current VEGF- and mTORtargeted therapies. Rapamycin-induced cell-cycle exit was
intact in p27/ cells (41). This suggests that mTOR-targeted
therapy and noncytotoxic DNMT1 depletion could be antiproliferative via different pathways. Moreover, the absence of
early apoptosis, and the protein expression changes noted
with DAC treatment of the p53-mutated RCC cell line, suggests that differentiation-mediated cell-cycle exit may be

independent of p53/apoptosis pathways that are frequently
mutated or attenuated in malignant cells.
DAC was originally developed as a DNA-damaging cytotoxic
agent (46). Therefore, in traditional phase 1 studies, doses were
escalated to maximum tolerated levels. In 14 RCC patients
treated with pulse-cycled cytotoxic DAC (75 mg/m2 administered intravenously for >1 hour every 7 hours for 3 doses, with
cycles repeated every 5 weeks), there was no antitumor activity
(47). Rationalizing the pharmacodynamic objective of therapy
from cytotoxicity to noncytotoxic DNMT1 depletion enables
lowering of the dose to approximately 7.5 mg/m2 (10), because
DNMT1 depletion can be achieved with relatively low
concentrations of DAC. The resulting decrease in toxicity
can enable more frequent administration to increase the time
of exposure, a critical consideration with S-phase–specific
therapy (because increasing time of exposure will facilitate
incorporation of drug into a greater fraction of the tumor cell
population). S-phase dependence of DAC could be a likely
explanation for the decrease in efficacy observed with concurrent sunitinib (sunitinib may have had cytostatic effects on
the RCC cells).
DAC has been investigated as a possible adjunct to immunotherapy to reactivate expression of genes that could favor
immune recognition and destruction of tumor (4, 12). In a
clinical trial examining the combination of DAC and interleukin-2 to treat RCC and melanoma (12), the dose of DAC was
reduced to levels that are noncytotoxic when administered 1
to 3 times per week (10). However, daily administration of this
dose, 5 days per week in weeks 1 and 2 of the 12-week cycles in
this trial, contributed to significant leukopenia. Although lowdose DAC can be noncytotoxic, temporary cell-cycle arrest
(cytostasis) is likely still produced. Therefore, daily DAC
administration could prolong cytostasis and cause or exacerbate cytopenia. The nondaily, but relatively frequent, 3 times
per week administration used in the xenograft model here was
a stratagem to maximize cumulative exposure while minimizing consequences of cytostasis such as cytopenia. This
type of DAC dose and schedule has been used to treat
nonmalignant disease (10). A major side effect was an
increase in platelet counts during therapy, indicating minimal

cytostatic/cytotoxic effects (10). As shown here, extended
cytostasis is not required for differentiation therapy of RCC.
Indeed, the late increase in p27 expression (peaking at day 5
after DAC treatment), the late reduction in cell proliferation
and tumor xenograft size, and the observation that DACtreated RCC cells can resume cell division (by days 2–3)
suggest that differentiation-mediated RCC cell-cycle exit
may occur after 1 to 2 cell divisions. The present in vitro
and in vivo results suggest that noncytotoxic regimens similar
to those used in nonmalignant disease merit clinical study in
RCC; however, responses may be more gradual than with
conventional cytostatic/cytotoxic therapy.
The observations here provide in vitro and in vivo support
for rationalizing dose and schedule of DAC for noncytotoxic
epigenetic differentiation therapy of RCC. The differentiation-based mechanism of action spares normal stem cells,
seems not to depend on p53/apoptosis pathways, and facilitates greater exposure to therapy. This treatment, with a
distinctive mechanism of action, could complement existing
treatment options and warrants further preclinical and
clinical investigation.
