BACKGROUND. The primary objectives were to measure and compare time to
initiation of chemotherapy for patients undergoing treatment either before or after the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), and to measure and compare the location of care
for patients undergoing chemotherapy either before or after the enactment of the
MMA.

METHODS. A Web-based survey was conducted of a convenience sample of
patients with cancer.

RESULTS. A total of 1421 respondents completed the survey, 684 in the pre-MMA

CONCLUSIONS. Overall, the findings do not support generalizations from anecdotal reports that patients have been affected by the change in reimbursement to
oncologists for chemotherapy as a result of the MMA. The analysis may be confounded by payments to physicians in the concurrent Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services cancer demonstration project because these payments may
have delayed changes in care. Moreover, research is needed to examine
the effects of the legislation on vulnerable populations. Cancer 2007;110:2304–

T

he Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act of 2003 (MMA) is estimated to save the government millions of
dollars in excess expenditures through modification of the average
wholesale price payment schedule, which has been widely reported to
over-reimburse for chemotherapy services.1 The MMA seeks to remedy over-reimbursement by restructuring payments for drug acquisition and administration. To facilitate the transition to the new
payment schedule, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) implemented a 1-year demonstration project to evaluate how
changes in reimbursement for chemotherapy affect patients’ quality
of life. Oncologists and patient advocates have expressed concerns
that the MMA may lead to dramatic changes in the provision of cancer
care by forcing many patients to receive treatment in hospitals, sometimes far from their homes, rather than in their physicians’ offices.2

Reimbursement for Chemotherapy/Friedman et al.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients are
feeling the effects of the new payment system, which
went into effect on January 1, 2005. Some oncologists
report that they have begun to eliminate nurses and
other staff, thereby reducing the attention that
patients receive.3 Oncologists in private practice
report that they have closed satellite offices, requiring patients to travel much farther for treatment,
particularly in rural areas.3,4 However, a recent focus
group study commissioned by the Medicare Payment
Advisory Commission found that most beneficiaries
did not perceive changes in their cancer treatment
after implementation of the MMA.5
In light of conflicting perceptions of the effects
of the MMA on patients, we sought to examine
patients’ perceptions of changes in access to and
satisfaction with care since the implementation of
the MMA. Our primary objectives were to 1) measure
and compare time to initiation of chemotherapy for
patients undergoing treatment either before or after
the enactment of the MMA; and 2) measure and
compare the location of care for patients undergoing
chemotherapy either before or after the enactment of
the MMA. We selected these primary objectives for 2
reasons. First, evidence for a relation between survival and the timing of chemotherapy is inconclusive.
For example, Shannon et al.6 found no relation, but
other studies have shown that early initiation of
chemotherapy may improve health outcomes.7,8 Second, patients who move from outpatient facilities to
hospital-based treatment settings may experience
greater burden in receiving chemotherapy and thus
forego necessary treatment. Previous research suggests that distance to a treatment facility and difficulty securing transportation are potential major
barriers to treatment.9 We hypothesized that the
MMA might increase time to initiation of chemotherapy and could affect where patients are treated. Our
secondary objective was to measure and compare
patients’ satisfaction with treatment before and after
the enactment of the MMA. To obtain information
from patients with cancer concurrent with policy
changes, we implemented this study through a Webbased survey of patients with cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
By using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we sought to
recruit 600 patients who received chemotherapy for
cancer before the enactment of the MMA and 600
patients who received chemotherapy for cancer after
the enactment of the MMA. With 600 respondents in
each arm, the study would have 99% statistical
power to detect a 1-week increase in time to initia-

2305

tion of chemotherapy (the primary outcome variable)
and 67% statistical power to detect a half-week
increase in time to initiation of chemotherapy. We
expected Medicare beneficiaries to be differentially
affected because the MMA pertains only to them.
Consequently, we stratified the sample by age
(patients younger than 65 vs patients 65 or older)
and used the younger age group as a control group.

Participants and Procedures
Respondents were adults with cancer who reported
receiving chemotherapy intravenously. We included
respondents in the pre-MMA group if they began and
completed an entire course of chemotherapy between
January 2003 and January 2005. We included respondents in the post-MMA group if they began the first
course of chemotherapy on or after February 1, 2005.
Interactive Clinical Intelligence ([ICI] Ketchum,
Idaho) administered the survey to respondents via
the Internet. ICI is a market research and database
development firm with access to more than 500,000
patients per month in over 100 major US markets
through Cancer Consultants’ (Ketchum, Idaho) portal
and syndication network.
ICI initially used 2 methods to invite potential
study participants to complete the survey. First, they
sent an invitation via E-mail to participants in their
database who previously agreed to participate in survey research. Second, a link to the survey was available on the Cancer Consultants website (http://www.
cancerconsultants.com). ICI encountered recruitment
challenges in the cohort of older patients and had to
implement 2 additional recruitment strategies. First,
ICI sent invitations via e-mail to the e-mail distribution lists of other cancer-related organizations (eg,
Gilda’s Club, National Patient Advocate Foundation).
Second, ICI distributed paper invitations to oncology
practices around the US. Initial recruitment e-mails
were sent during the period from April to July 2006.
This recruitment strategy is similar to using electronically posted advertisements, which results in a convenience sample.
Survey Development
The survey was designed to elicit information about
respondents’ experiences with chemotherapy, particularly with regard to access to and satisfaction with
care. We developed the survey by reviewing existing
surveys and by reviewing the literature.10–12 A draft
of the survey was piloted with 3 oncologists to assess
content validity. In addition, we conducted cognitive
interviews with 10 patients with cancer to assess
understandability and content validity, and we used
information from the cognitive interviews to further

refine the survey. (The survey is available from the
authors upon request.)

Measures
Demographic and descriptive characteristics
Demographic information included cancer type; type
of health insurance at the time of chemotherapy;
state of residence; rural, suburban, or urban location;
sex; race/ethnicity; living situation; annual household
income; and education level. We asked 2 questions
to measure respondents’ exposure to information
about the potential impact of the MMA on patients
with cancer: whether they or their spouse or partner
currently or in the past worked in a medical industry
or profession, and whether the respondent was
aware of the MMA.
Access to chemotherapy
We assessed respondents’ access to chemotherapy by
asking them to describe their experiences with
obtaining a referral for treatment, waiting time before
initiation of treatment, travel to the treatment location, change in treatment location and physician, and
employment status at the time of treatment. We also
asked respondents if they had to stay overnight at a
location other than their home as part of treatment.
Satisfaction with chemotherapy
Respondents rated satisfaction with specific aspects
of their chemotherapy experience, such as the care
provided by the oncologist and other staff, ability to
pay out-of-pocket costs, and the severity and control
of side effects of treatment. We assessed general
satisfaction with chemotherapy by asking respondents to describe their level of satisfaction with the
coordination of care during chemotherapy sessions
and the ease of obtaining answers to questions about
chemotherapy. Satisfaction was measured on a 4point categorical scale (‘‘very dissatisfied’’ to ‘‘very
satisfied’’).
Data Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data
collected in the survey. We used Wilcoxon rank sum
tests to examine differences between groups for continuous variables and v2 tests to examine differences
between groups for categorical variables.
To test the null hypothesis that mean days to
initiation of chemotherapy did not change after
enactment of the MMA, we developed a multivariable regression model in which the dependent variable was the number of days to initiation of
chemotherapy. Independent variables included sex,
race/ethnicity, type of cancer, a binary variable indi-

cating age 65 years, a binary variable indicating the
timing of chemotherapy relative to enactment of the
MMA, and an interaction term between the age
group and timing variables. We also constructed a
model to test the null hypothesis that the location of
chemotherapy was unchanged after enactment of the
MMA. We developed a multivariable, multinomial,
logistic regression model in which the dependent
variable indicated whether the initial cycle of chemotherapy was administered in a private physician’s
office, hospital outpatient clinic or infusion center,
community-based infusion center, or inpatient hospital setting. Independent variables were the same as
those in the regression model for mean days to
initiation of chemotherapy. Finally, we examined differences within 2 subgroups of participants—those in
rural locations and those with Medicare without supplemental insurance because these groups have been
identified as being the most vulnerable to changes in
practice as a result of the MMA.
We used SAS v. 9.1.3 for all analyses (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). The institutional review board of the Duke
University Health System determined that the study
was exempt from the requirement for approval.

RESULTS
A total of 1421 respondents qualified for participation and completed the survey—684 in the pre-MMA
group and 737 in the post-MMA group. There were
an equal number of respondents in each of the 10
Medicare regions (approximately 140 respondents in
each region).

Respondent Characteristics
Table 1 shows respondent characteristics by cohort
and age group. Most respondents were women, most
were white, and the mean age was 60 years. There
were relatively fewer women in the older age group
(51%) than in the younger age group (80.5%), reflecting the relatively high number of patients with breast
cancer in the group aged 65 and younger. About half of
the respondents reported having private, employerbased health insurance at the time of chemotherapy.
Twenty-six percent of the respondents lived in rural
areas.
Access to Chemotherapy
Table 2 shows access to care stratified by age and
MMA cohort. Time to initiation of chemotherapy was
similar in the 2 groups. Respondents aged 65 years
or older in both the pre-MMA and post-MMA groups
had a median waiting time of 3.0 weeks (P 5 .74).
Among respondents aged 65 years or older who

reported waiting 4 weeks or more, having to undergo
surgery before starting chemotherapy was reported
as a reason for the delay by 36% of respondents in
the pre-MMA group versus 61% in the post-MMA
group (P 5 .02).
After adjusting for sex, rural location, cancer type,
and race/ethnicity, we found that respondents aged 65
years or older in the post-MMA cohort received chemotherapy 2.8 days earlier than those in the pre-MMA
cohort. However, this finding was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.59 to 1.02).
Among respondents aged 65 years or older, most
respondents received chemotherapy in outpatient
hospital infusion centers or infusion centers affiliated
with private practices (73% in the pre-MMA group vs
62% in the post-MMA group; P 5 .02). Only 12% of
respondents in both the pre-MMA and post-MMA
groups reported that the treatment location changed
during the course of treatment. Most respondents in
both groups reported traveling approximately 30
minutes to the chemotherapy location. Finally, a
small percentage of respondents reported having to
stay overnight at a location other than home after
the chemotherapy visit (5.5% in the pre-MMA group
vs 5.0% in the post-MMA group; P 5 .66).
After adjusting for sex, rural location, cancer type,
and race/ethnicity, there was no statistically significant change in treatment location between respondents aged 65 or older in the pre-MMA and postMMA cohorts (odds ratio [OR], 1.53, 95% CI, 0.81–2.89
for hospital inpatient settings; OR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.42–

1.08 for hospital outpatient settings; OR, 0.84, 95% CI,
0.53–1.33 for community infusion centers—all compared with private physician practice).
Respondents who were younger than 65 years
reported similar experiences as respondents aged 65
years or older. This finding was contrary to our expectation that the effects of the MMA would only be
reported by respondents older than 65 years because
these respondents were eligible for Medicare.
Younger participants in the pre-MMA group had an
average waiting time of 3.4 weeks, compared with 3.6
weeks in the post-MMA group (P 5 .10). Most respondents in the younger age group received chemotherapy in outpatient hospital infusion centers or
infusion centers affiliated with private practices (70%
in the pre-MMA group vs 64% in the post-MMA
group; P 5 .01).

Satisfaction With Chemotherapy Services
Satisfaction in the pre-MMA and post-MMA groups
was similar. Among respondents aged 65 or older,
65% of respondents in both groups reported being
‘‘very satisfied’’ with the care their oncologist provided (P 5 .13). Seventy-six percent of participants
aged 65 years and older in the pre-MMA group were
‘‘very satisfied’’ with the care that the staff at the
infusion location provided (P 5 .31).
Paying out-of-pocket costs and the ability to pay
those costs differed between the pre-MMA and postMMA groups. Among respondents aged 65 years or
older, fewer respondents in the post-MMA cohort

(25.6% vs 46.4%; P < .001).
Among respondents younger than 65 years, there
was an increase in the number who were ‘‘very satisfied’’ with the care their oncologist provided (58% in
the pre-MMA group vs 67% in the post-MMA group;
P < .01). There was a similar trend with respect to
satisfaction with the care that the infusion center
staff provided (68% in the pre-MMA group vs 76% in
the post-MMA group; P 5 .11) (Table 3).

Subgroup Analyses
We separately examined access to care in 2 subgroups of respondents—those living in rural areas

and Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental insurance. Given the small number of respondents
from rural areas, we could not analyze these
responses by age group.
Among respondents in rural areas, waiting time
was 3.0 weeks in the pre-MMA group and 3.9 weeks
in the post-MMA group (P 5 .25). Among respondents enrolled in Medicare without supplemental
insurance, waiting time was 4.3 weeks in the preMMA group and 4.0 weeks in the post-MMA group
(P 5 .95).
There were differences in treatment location
among respondents in rural areas and among Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental insurance.

post-MMA group (P < .01). Fourteen percent of
respondents in the pre-MMA group received treatment in a private physician’s office, compared with
30% in the post-MMA group (P < .01). The findings
were similar among Medicare beneficiaries without
supplemental insurance. Forty percent of these
respondents in the pre-MMA group reported receiving
chemotherapy in an outpatient hospital infusion center, compared with 21% in the post-MMA group
(P 5 .03), and 17% in the pre-MMA group reported
receiving chemotherapy in a private physician’s office,
compared with 33% in the post-MMA group (P 5 .03).
Given the limited sample size, we could not
assess the robustness of these findings in multivariable analyses (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Reimbursement for chemotherapy drugs changed
considerably with the enactment of the MMA. How
the legislation will affect patients is unclear, but some
commentators have expressed concern that patients’
access to and satisfaction with care will suffer.2–4 To
examine perceived changes in care, we compared time
to initiation of chemotherapy, treatment location, and
satisfaction with care before and after enactment of
the MMA through a Web-based survey of a geographi-

cally diverse sample of patients with cancer. Overall,
we found no difference between the pre-MMA and
post-MMA groups with respect to mean days to initiation of treatment and treatment location.
Four findings are particularly noteworthy. First,
we found no increase in the time from diagnosis to
first chemotherapy visit after the enactment of the
MMA. Respondents reported a mean time to initiation
of treatment of 22 days. The estimates are generally
consistent with the findings of Schrag et al.,13 who
found that the mean time to initiation of adjuvant
chemotherapy after colon resection was 25 to 30 days.
It is noteworthy that for respondents aged 65 or older
who waited at least 4 weeks to begin treatment, a
greater percentage in the post-MMA group reported
that needing to undergo surgery was the main reason
for the delay. The reason for this finding is unclear.
Future research is warranted to assess whether patterns of care have changed and, if so, how those
changes affect tumor response endpoints, overall
survival, performance status, and quality of life.
Second, the univariate analysis suggested changes
in treatment location, with respondents moving from
hospital outpatient settings to hospital inpatient settings. However, this finding was not supported after
controlling for several important confounders. The
results of the multivariable model suggest that treatment location has not changed. Alternatively, it may

be that the 1-year Medicare demonstration project
delayed changes in treatment location so that the full
effect of the MMA will not be felt until the demonstration payments are phased out. In addition, the sample
population had relatively high socioeconomic status.
This cohort may not be the most vulnerable to effects
of the MMA.
Third, approximately 87% of the cohort was satisfied or very satisfied with the care they received. This
finding is consistent with other studies demonstrating
general satisfaction with oncology care.14–16 More
respondents in the older post-MMA group reported
difficulty paying out-of-pocket costs associated with
treatment. This finding supports anecdotal evidence
that some Medicare beneficiaries may have difficulty
paying their coinsurance.5 Currently, data sources to
examine the impact of higher copayments on vulnera-

ble Medicare beneficiaries are limited. Additional
research should examine the effects of higher copayments on access to care and health outcomes.
Finally, the subgroup analyses of respondents in
rural areas and respondents with Medicare without
supplemental insurance suggest that treatment locations have changed for these respondents since the
implementation of the MMA. However, the findings
should be interpreted with caution. The sample sizes
of both groups were small, and covariate adjustments
were not possible. Consequently, the observed differences may reflect baseline differences between the
pre-MMA and post-MMA cohorts in these subgroups.
However, anecdotal reports suggest that these subgroups may be the most vulnerable to changes
caused by the MMA. Further research in this area is
warranted.

Our study has some limitations. First, some
respondents were asked to recall experiences that
occurred up to 3 years prior. We attempted to minimize recall bias by limiting the entry date of the
study to January 2003 and by asking participants to
focus on the first time they received chemotherapy.
Moreover, participants in the cognitive interviews we
conducted during survey development reported having little difficulty remembering when they had their
first course of chemotherapy. Second, the survey
relied on responses from a convenience sample of
patients. However, we stratified the sample by Medicare region (140 respondents from each region) to
ensure nationwide representation. We also compared
key demographic characteristics of our sample to
national cancer prevalence statistics.17 Compared
with the national sample, our sample included more
women (67% vs 53%) and more respondents with
breast cancer (33% vs 23%), lung cancer (12% vs 3%),
and lymphoma (12% vs 5%). These differences may
be explained by the inclusion criteria for our study.
Because the study included only respondents who
underwent intravenous chemotherapy, cancers that
are treated primarily by surgery would not be represented in our sample (eg, prostate cancer). The samples were similar with respect to race/ethnicity (93%
white in the present study vs 88% white in the
national sample). Given these comparisons, our findings may be generalizable to patients affected by the
MMA. Third, because the survey was administered
on the Internet and respondents were recruited
through patient resource Web sites, respondents to
the survey may have a different level of ability to
identify resources to help them navigate the healthcare system compared with patients who did not
participate in the survey.
There is substantial concern about the effects that
changes in reimbursement to physicians for chemotherapy will have on Medicare beneficiaries’ ability to
access care. Overall, our findings do not support generalizations from anecdotal reports that patients are
being affected by these changes as a result of the
MMA. The analysis may be confounded by payments
to physicians in the concurrent CMS cancer demonstration project, because these payments may have
delayed changes in care. Furthermore, additional
research is needed to fully examine the effects of the
legislation on vulnerable populations.
