Abstract

Introduction

Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm of the
biliary tree. It has a high rate of mortality, and currently,
there is no effective chemoprevention and treatment. This
study was designed to investigate the potential effect of W3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (W3-PUFA) on human cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and to determine their mechanisms of
actions. Treatment of three human cholangiocarcinoma cells
(CCLP1, HuCCT1, SG231) with two W3-PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), for 12 to 72
h resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell
growth; in contrast, arachidonic acid, a W6-PUFA, had no
significant effect. The W3-PUFA effect is due to the induction
of apoptosis, given that DHA induced the cleaved form of
PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9. DHA and EPA treatment
caused dephosphorylation (and hence, the activation) of
glycogen synthase kinase-3B (GSK-3B) with a decline of
B-catenin protein. Accordingly, DHA treatment also decreased
the B-catenin–mediated T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
factor (TCF/LEF) reporter activity, and inhibited the expression of c-Met, a B-catenin–controlled downstream gene
implicated in cholangiocarcinogenesis. The GSK-3B inhibitor,
SB216763, partially prevented DHA-induced reduction of
B-catenin protein and TCF/LEF reporter activity, and restored
cell growth, suggesting the involvement of GSK-3B dephosphorylation in W3-PUFA–induced B-catenin degradation. In
parallel, DHA treatment also induced the formation of the
B-catenin/Axin/GSK-3B binding complex, further leading
to B-catenin degradation. Moreover, DHA inhibited the
expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and enhanced the
expression of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, a
physiologic COX-2 antagonist, in human cholangiocarcinoma
cells. These findings suggest that W3-PUFAs block cholangiocarcinoma cell growth at least in part through inhibition of
Wnt/B-catenin and COX-2 signaling pathways. Thus, utilization of W3-PUFAs may represent an effective and safe
therapeutic approach for the chemoprevention and treatment
of human cholangiocarcinoma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):553–60]

Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial neoplasm of the
biliary tree with a high rate of mortality (1–6). Early diagnosis of
cholangiocarcinoma is difficult, and currently, there is no effective
chemoprevention or treatment. The tumor often arises from
background conditions that cause long-standing inflammation,
injury, and reparative biliary epithelial cell proliferation, such as
primary sclerosing cholangitis, clonorchiasis, hepatolithiasis, or
complicated fibropolycystic diseases (1–6). Consistent with the
strong association between bile duct chronic inflammation and
cholangiocarcinoma, recent studies have documented an important role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)–derived prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), a potent lipid inflammatory mediator, in cholangiocarcinogenesis (1, 2, 4, 6). For example, increased COX-2 expression has
been documented in cholangiocarcinoma cells and precancerous
bile duct lesions but not in normal bile duct epithelial cells (BEC;
refs. 7–9). Overexpression of COX-2 in cultured human cholangiocarcinoma cells enhances PGE2 production and promotes tumor
growth, whereas depletion of COX-2 attenuates growth (10, 11).
Treatment of cholangiocarcinoma cells with exogenous PGE2
increases tumor cell growth and prevents apoptosis (10–15).
Consistent with these findings, selective COX-2 inhibitors prevent
cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and invasion, in vitro and in nude
mice (4, 10, 11, 14–16), although their effect may be mediated
through COX-2–dependent and -independent mechanisms.
Recent evidence suggests that alteration of other growthregulatory molecules such as Wnt/h-catenin pathway is also
implicated in cholangiocarcinogenesis (17–20). h-Catenin is a
key mediator in Wnt regulation of multiple cellular functions
in embryogenesis and tumorigenesis (21–24). In adult tissues,
h-catenin is a component of stable cell adherent complexes whereas
its free form functions as a coactivator for a family of transcription
factors termed T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF).
Wnt proteins comprise a family of highly conserved secreted
proteins that signal through the Frizzled receptors (21–24). In the
absence of a Wnt signal, h-catenin exists within a cytoplasmic
complex (h-catenin destruction complex) along with glycogen
synthase kinase-3h (GSK-3h), adenomatous polyposis coli, and
Axin, where it is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation by
the proteasome. Activation of Wnt signaling perturbs this
destruction complex, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of
h-catenin and allowing its translocation into the cell nucleus. In
the nucleus, h-catenin associates with TCF/LEF that stimulate the
transcription of target genes important for proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (21–24). Recent studies have shown that
accumulation of nuclear h-catenin is induced by PGE2, in addition
to the canonical Wnt/Frizzled signaling, in human colon
cancer cells. Castellone et al. reported that PGE2 activates its

pathways. These findings provide important preclinical evidence
and molecular insight for the use of N3-PUFAs in the chemoprevention and treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma.

G protein–coupled receptor, EP2, resulting in direct association of
the G protein a subunit with the regulator of G protein signaling
domain of Axin; this results in the release of GSK-3h from its
complex with Axin, thus leading to h-catenin accumulation (25).
Shao et al. showed the involvement of the cyclic AMP/protein
kinase A pathway in PGE2-induced h-catenin accumulation in
colon cancer cells (26). However, it remains unknown whether the
COX-2/PG and Wnt/h-catenin signaling pathways converge during
cholangiocarcinogenesis.
Although PGE2 derived from arachidonic acid (AA; an N3-PUFA)
is known to promote tumor growth, there is convincing
experimental evidence that the N3-PUFAs rich in fish oil, such as
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
prevent carcinogenesis (27, 28). However, the potential effect of
N3-PUFAs on cholangiocarcinoma growth has not been studied
and the molecular mechanisms for their anticancer actions remain
incompletely understood. This study was designed to investigate
the effect and mechanism of N3-PUFAs in human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Our data show that DHA and EPA inhibited the growth
of three human cholangiocarcinoma cells (CCLP1, SG231, and
HuCCT1). Moreover, our data reveal that COX-2–derived PGE2
activates h-catenin signaling pathways in human cholangiocarcinoma cells and that N3-PUFAs inhibit cholangiocarcinoma cell
growth by simultaneously blocking h-catenin and COX-2 signaling

points (30, 60, 90, and 120 min; right ). The cell lysates
were obtained for immunoprecipitation with Axin
antibody followed by immunoblotting with antibodies
against GSK-3h and Axin.

of cell suspension (containing 0.5–2  104 cells) were plated in each well of a
96-well plate. After 24 h of culture to allow reattachment, the cells then were
treated with specific reagents such as DHA or Wnt3a-conditioned medium
(Wnt3a-CM) for the indicated time points. At the end of each experiment, the
cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (10 AL) was added to each well, and the cells
were incubated at 37jC for 0.5 to 5 h. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured
using an automatic ELISA plate reader. The viability of primary mouse BECs
was determined by using cell counts with trypan blue exclusion.
Immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of cellular protein from the
treated cells were incubated overnight with 10 AL of rabbit anti-human Axin
polyclonal antibody at 4jC, followed by the addition of 20 AL of protein A/G
PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mixture was incubated for
2 h and then washed thrice with the cell lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.55), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets from Roche Diagnostics]. The final pellets were dissolved in 20 AL of
2 protein loading buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analysis using a 1:1,000 dilution of mouse anti-human
GSK-3h or h-catenin monoclonal antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.).
Transient transfection of COX-2 expression plasmid in human
cholangiocarcinoma cells. The cells were exposed to the mixture of
LipofectAMINE plus reagents and COX-2 expression plasmid ( full-length
human COX-2 cDNA cloned in pcDNA3 vector), pcDNA3 control vector,
or TCF/LEF-Luc reporter plasmid for 4 h. Following removal of the
transfection mixtures, fresh serum-free medium was added with specific
reagents as indicated in the text. The cells with optimal overexpression of
COX-2 were confirmed by immunoblotting and subsequently used for
further experiments.
Luciferase reporter activity assay. The cultured cells were seeded at a
concentration achieving 80% confluence in 12-well plates for 18 h before
transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with 0.2 Ag/well of
translucent TCF/LEF-Luc reporter vector, which was designed to measure
the transcriptional activity of TCF/LEF-responsive genes. After transfection,
the cells were treated with specific reagents such as DHA or Wnt3a-CM in
serum-free medium at the indicated time periods. The cell lysates were then
obtained with 1 reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity was
assayed in a Berthold AutoLumat LB953 Luminometer by using the

Culture of human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Three human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell lines—HuCCT1 (obtained from the
Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank), SG231, and CCLP1 were
cultured according to our previously described methods (10, 12, 29). Briefly,
CCLP1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L
of L-glutamine, and 50 Ag/mL of gentamicin. SG231 cells were cultured in
a-MEM with 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 50 Ag/mL of gentamicin, 10 mmol/L
of HEPES, and 10% FBS. HuCCT1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, and 50 Ag/mL of
gentamicin. The cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified CO2 incubator.
The experiments were performed when cells reached f80% confluence
and were conducted in serum-free medium with serum deprivation for
24 h before the experiments.
Culture of primary BECs. Primary mouse BECs were isolated from
normal female C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks old) and cultured as previously
described (30, 31). Briefly, BECs were cultured on collagen gels in complete
serum-free medium, which consisted of DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma)
supplemented with 5.4 g/L of D-glucose, 50 Ag/mL of gentamicin,
antibiotic–antimycotic (100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin sulfate, 250 ng/mL amphotericin B), 10 mmol/L of HEPES,
2.5 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), insulin-transferrin-selenium-X
(10 mg/L insulin, 5.5 mg/L transferrin, 6.7 ng/L sodium selenite), 0.1 mmol/L
of minimal essential media nonessential amino acid solution, 2 mmol/L of
L-glutamine, 32 ng/mL of thyroxin (Sigma), 10 ng/mL of prostaglandin
E1 (Sigma), 40 ng/mL of hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 Amol/L of forskolin
(Sigma), and 50 Ag/mL of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 21 days. Cells (1  105)
in each well of a 48-well plate were subcultured and allowed to reattach in
complete DMEM, which is complete serum-free medium with 50 Ag/mL of
bovine pituitary extract and 10 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor. Then the
cells were held quiescent overnight in simple and serum-free medium, which
is DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5.4 g/L of D-glucose, 50 Ag/mL of
gentamicin, antibiotic–antimycotic (100 units/mL penicillin G sodium,
100 Ag/mL streptomycin sulfate, 250 ng/mL amphotericin B), 10 mmol/L of
HEPES, and 2.5 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin.
Cell viability assay. The viability of human cholangiocarcinoma cells was
determined by using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1, a tetrazolium salt
that is cleaved by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. Briefly, 100 AL

chemistry using antibodies against h-catenin and COX-2. Increased cytoplasmic staining for COX-2 and nuclear staining for
h-catenin was observed in cholangiocarcinoma cells when
compared with the nonneoplastic bile duct epithelium (Fig. 1).
COX-2 is expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm of cholangiocarcinoma cells, and to a lesser degree, in BECs. The average staining
intensity for COX-2 in cholangiocarcinoma cells is 2.04 F 0.52,
which is significantly higher than that in nonneoplastic bile duct
epithelium (0.48 F 0.12; n = 27, P < 0.01, Student’s t test). Different
h-catenin expression patterns were observed between cholangiocarcinoma cells and interlobular bile ducts. In the interlobular
BECs, h-catenin is expressed exclusively in the plasma membrane
with no significant cytoplasmic staining and the absence of
nuclear staining. In cholangiocarcinoma cells, there is evident
cytoplasmic staining with decreased plasma membrane. Nuclear
staining for h-catenin was observed in 9 of 27 cholangiocarcinoma tissues, but not in nonneoplastic BECs. These findings
indicate the activation of h-catenin and overexpression of COX-2
in human cholangiocarcinomas.
Given the presence of active COX-2 and h-catenin signaling
pathways in cholangiocarcinoma, we next examined the potential
effect of COX-2 on h-catenin activation in cultured human
cholangiocarcinoma cells. Our results show that overexpression
of COX-2 increased the TCF/LEF reporter activity in the human
cholangiocarcinoma cell line, CCLP1 (Fig. 2A). Because PGE2 is the
predominant COX-2 metabolite in cholangiocarcinoma cells (4), its
effect on h-catenin activation was next examined. As shown in

luciferase assay system from Promega. The relative luciferase activity was
calculated after normalization of cellular proteins. All values are expressed
as the percentage of activity relative to basal activity.
Immunoblotting. At the end of each indicated treatment, the cells were
scraped off the plates and centrifuged, washed twice with cold PBS
containing 0.5 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 Ag/mL of
leupeptin, and resuspended in 5-fold volume of hypotonic buffer consisting
of 50 mmol/L of HEPES (pH 7.55), 1 mmol/L of EDTA, 1 mmol/L of DTT,
and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
After sonication, the whole cell lysate was collected by centrifugation at
15,000  g, 4jC for 10 min to remove cell debris, and stored in aliquots at
80jC until use. The protein concentration in the cell extracts were
determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty micrograms of
cellular protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4% to 20% Tris-glycine gels
for PARP, h-catenin, GSK-3h, phosphorylated GSK-3h, Akt, phosphorylated
Akt, c-Met, Axin, cytochrome c, caspase-3, caspase-9, COX-2, 15-PGDH, or
h-actin. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto
the nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked
with PBS-T (0.5% Tween 20 in PBS) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at
room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4jC
with individual primary antibodies in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk at
the dilutions specified by the manufacturers. Following three washes with
PBS-T, the membranes were then incubated with the horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:10,000 dilution in PBS-T
containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes
were then washed thrice with PBS-T and the protein bands were visualized
with the ECL Western blotting detection system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Preparation of Wnt3a-CM. Wnt3a-CM and the control L cell–
conditioned medium were prepared as described in the American Type
Culture Collection protocol. Briefly, the cells were split 1:10 in 10 mL culture
medium from 10 cm Petri dishes and cultured at 37jC. After 4 days of culture, the medium was collected, centrifuged, and sterilized through a filter to
obtain the first batch of Wnt3a-CM. An additional 10 mL of fresh medium was
subsequently added to the cells and the cultures were continued for an
additional 3 days; the medium was then removed, centrifuged, and sterilized
through a filter to obtained the second batch of Wnt3a-CM. The first and
second batches of the medium were mixed 1:1 and then used for experiments of Wnt3a-CM. The control L cell–conditioned medium was prepared
following the same procedure. They were stored at 80jC until use.
Immunohistochemical stains for COX-2 and B-catenin in human
cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Twenty-seven archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of human cholangiocarcinoma and adjacent
nonneoplastic liver tissues were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center. The tissue specimens were used for immunohistochemical
analysis for COX-2 and h-catenin according to standard procedures. Briefly,
the slides were incubated with 1:100 diluted monoclonal antibody against
human COX-2 or h-catenin, followed by probing with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:200), incubation with the ABC complex, and addition
of a 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine substrate. The staining intensity for COX-2 was
scored in each specimen on a scale of 0 to 3, in which 0, negative staining;
1, weakly positive staining; 2, moderately positive staining; and 3, strongly
positive staining. For each sample, 10 random high-power fields were
scored. The immunoreactivity for h-catenin was determined in all the
sections, with special attention to the staining patterns (nuclear versus
plasma membrane). The protocol for using human tissue specimens was
approved by the University of Pittsburgh (Institutional Review Board
no. 020134). None of the cases used in this study had patient identifiers and
strict confidentiality was maintained in accordance with the approval
granted by the institutional review board.

Figure 3. DHA treatment induces apoptosis in human cholangiocarcinoma
cells. A, DHA induces activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and cleavage of
PARP. CCLP1 cells were treated with DHA (20 Amol/L) for 24 h and the cell
lysates were obtained for Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of cellular
proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using
antibodies against PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9 as described in Materials
and Methods. B, DHA induces the release of cytochrome c in CCLP1 cells. The
levels of cytochrome c in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were
determined by Western blotting analysis.

We first did immunohistochemical stains for h-catenin and
COX-2 in human cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Twenty-seven paired

Figure 4. N3-PUFAs reduce h-catenin protein level and TCF/LEF transcription activity in human cholangiocarcinoma cells. A and B, DHA and EPA decrease
h-catenin and c-Met expression in CCLP1 cells. The cells were treated with 60 Amol/L of DHA or EPA in serum-free medium for 3 or 6 h. The cell lysates
were obtained for Western blot analysis using antibodies against h-catenin and c-Met as described in Materials and Methods. C, DHA treatment decreases
TCF/LEF reporter activity. CCLP1 cells were transiently transfected with the pTCF/LEF-Luc reporter vector. After transfection, the cells were cultured in serum-free

therapies aimed at simultaneous disruption of the COX-2/PGE2
and Wnt/h-catenin pathways might produce effective chemopreventive and antitumorigenic effects. The results presented
below in this article describe a strong inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth by N3-PUFAs through blocking of Wnt/h-catenin
and COX-2 signaling pathways.
We next examined the effect of N3-PUFAs on the growth of
three human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (CCLP1, SG231, and
HuCCT1). Incubation of CCLP1 cells with two N3-PUFAs
(20 Amol/L), DHA and EPA, resulted in a time-dependent reduction
of cell viability; in contrast AA, a N6-PUFA, had no significant effect
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Treatment with 20 Amol/L of DHA for 12,

Fig. 2B, PGE2 treatment of CCLP1 cells also increased TCF/LEF
reporter activity. In contrast, PGE3, a N3-PUFA metabolite, showed
no significant effect. Moreover, PGE2 treatment also increased
GSK-3h phosphorylation (and thus inactivation; Fig. 2C) and caused
GSK-3h dissociation from Axin (thus preventing the formation of
the h-catenin destruction complex) in a time- and dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2D). These findings suggest that PGE2 activates the
h-catenin signaling pathway through inactivation of GSK-3h and
dissociation of the h-catenin destruction complex in human
cholangiocarcinoma cells.
Because the COX-2/PGE2 and Wnt/h-catenin signaling pathways
are active in human cholangiocarcinoma cells, we postulate that

immunoblotting with antibodies against GSK-3h, h-catenin, and Axin. B, the time course effect of DHA. CCLP1 cells were treated with 60 Amol/L of DHA at different time
points (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Axin antibody followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against GSK-3h, h-catenin,
and Axin. C, the dose-dependent effect of DHA. CCLP1 cells were treated with different concentrations of DHA for 1 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
with anti-Axin antibody followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against GSK-3h and Axin. D, AA inhibits the association of the Axin/GSK-3h/h-catenin complex.
CCLP1 cells were treated with 60 Amol/L of AA, DHA, or vehicle for 1 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Axin antibody followed by immunoblotting
with antibodies against GSK-3h, h-catenin, and Axin.

24, 48, and 72 h induced 20.53 F 1.8%, 16.77 F 2.56%, 5.1 F 1.49%,
and 4.34 F 0.3% reduction of viable cells, respectively. DHA seems to
have more effect, with f80% reduction of viable cells at 12 h and
>95% reduction at 48 and 72 h. The effects of DHA and EPA were
dose-dependent in all three human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines.
The cells treated with DHA and EPA exhibited morphologic features
of cell death, characterized by shrunken cells, rounded cells, and
detachment (Supplementary Fig. S1). The inhibitory effect of
N3-PUFAs on cholangiocarcinoma cell growth is specific, given
that DHA and EPA did not affect the growth of differentiated nonneoplastic primary biliary epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We next examined the proapoptotic molecules in cells treated
with DHA. As shown in Fig. 3, incubation of CCLP1 cells with
25 Amol/L of DHA for 24 h resulted in the activation of caspase-3
and caspase-9 with PARP cleavage and concomitant release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. These findings
indicate that N3-PUFAs inhibit human cholangiocarcinoma cell
growth through the induction of apoptosis.
Additional experiments were performed to assess the potential
effect of N3-PUFAs on h-catenin protein level and activity. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, treatment with DHA or EPA reduced the
level of h-catenin protein as well as c-Met, a h-catenin–controlled
downstream gene. Because h-catenin regulates gene expression via
binding as a transcription factor in complex with the TCF/LEF
transcription factor family to the promoter region of target genes,
we also determined the effect of DHA on TCF/LEF reporter activity.
The TCF/LEF transcription activity was assayed after transient
transfection of a luciferase reporter construct under the control
of the TCF/LEF response element. As shown in Fig. 4C, DHA
treatment significantly inhibited the TCF/LEF reporter activity
(f3.5-fold inhibition, P < 0.01).
The level of h-catenin in cells is tightly controlled by its
degradation complex composed of Axin, GSK-3h, and h-catenin in
which GSK-3h phosphorylates h-catenin and thus triggers its
ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation. The
activity of GSK-3h is regulated by its phosphorylation status, with
GSK-3h phosphorylation at Ser9 being functionally inactive. To
determine whether N3-PUFAs might induce h-catenin degradation
through inhibition of GSK-3h phosphorylation, we examined the
phosphorylated Ser9-GSK-3h and total GSK-3h protein levels in
CCLP1 cells treated with DHA. DHA treatment reduced GSK-3h
phosphorylation, whereas it had no effect on the protein level of
total GSK-3h (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Because the phosphorylation of GSK-3h is controlled by Akt, we also examined the potential
effect of DHA on Akt phosphorylation. Our data showed that DHA
had no effect on Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Thus, DHA most likely inhibited GSK-3h phosphorylation through
mechanisms independent of Akt. These findings provide evidence
for GSK-3h dephosphorylation (activation) in N3-PUFA–induced
degradation of h-catenin in cholangiocarcinoma cells.
To further determine the role of GSK-3h in DHA-induced
h-catenin degradation, CCLP1 cells were pretreated with the GSK3h inhibitor, SB216763 (5 Amol/L), for 1 h prior to DHA treatment
and the cells were analyzed for h-catenin protein level, TCF/LEF
reporter activity, and apoptosis. Inhibition of GSK-3h by SB216763
prevented DHA-induced reduction of h-catenin protein and TCF/
LEF reporter activity as well as c-Met expression (Supplementary
Fig. S3B and C). SB216763 also prevented DHA-induced PARP and
caspase-9 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). Accordingly, inhibition of GSK-3h by SB216763 also
partially restored cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S3E). These

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (2). January 15, 2008

findings further support the role of GSK-3h dephosphorylation
(activation) in DHA-induced h-catenin degradation in cholangiocarcinoma cells.
The degradation of h-catenin depends on h-catenin phosphorylation, which occurs in a multiprotein complex containing Axin,
GSK-3h, and h-catenin. It is believed that in this complex
assembled by Axin, GSK-3h phosphorylates the h-catenin primarily
when it is bound to Axin. To determine whether DHA alters the
assembly of the Axin/GSK-3h/h-catenin complex, immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments were performed to detect the
Axin/GSK-3h/h-catenin binding complex. As shown in Fig. 5A–C,
treatment of CCLP1 cells with DHA induced the association of Axin
with GSK-3h as well as h-catenin. This effect was observed within
1 h and persisted at 5 h. In contrast, AA, an N6-PUFA, decreased

w3-PUFAs Inhibit b-Catenin and COX-2 in Cholangiocarcinomas

the association of Axin with h-catenin and GSK-3h (Fig. 5D).
These findings indicate that DHA induces the formation of
the h-catenin destruction complex. Thus, N3-PUFAs induce
h-catenin degradation through dephosphorylation of GSK-3h and
the formation of the h-catenin destruction complex in human
cholangiocarcinoma cells.
Because Wnt3a is known to activate h-catenin signaling in cells,
additional experiments were carried out to determine whether
Wnt3a might protect cholangiocarcinoma cells from DHA-induced
apoptosis. Treatment of CCLP1 cells with Wnt3a-CM partially
prevented DHA-induced reduction of TCF/LEF transcription activity
and restored cell survival (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results
indicate that DHA inhibits cholangiocarcinoma growth at least in
part through down-regulation of Wnt/h-catenin signaling pathway.
A prominent mechanism for the chemopreventive action of
N3-PUFAs is their suppressive effect on the production of AAderived prostanoids, particularly PGE2 (28, 32). This is important
because PGE2 is implicated in multiple stages of tumorigenesis,
including modulation of inflammation, cancer cell proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and host
immune response to cancer cells (4). Therefore, we next examined
whether DHA might also affect the expression of COX-2 in our
system. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, treatment of CCLP1 cells with
DHA inhibited COX-2 promoter activity in a time- and dosedependent manner. DHA treatment also inhibited the expression of
COX-2 protein in cholangiocarcinoma cells (Fig. 6C). These
findings suggest that DHA inhibits the expression of COX-2 at
least in part through the suppression of gene transcription.
15-PGDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step of prostaglandin
catabolism and thus represents a physiologic antagonist of
COX-2 (33, 34). Recent emerging evidence suggests that elevated
PGE2 in cancers may be the result of enhanced COX-2–mediated
PGE2 synthesis as well as reduced 15-PGDH–mediated degradation
of PGE2. Therefore, we sought to further determine whether DHA
might affect 15-PGDH expression in human cholangiocarcinoma
cells. DHA treatment enhanced the expression of 15-PGDH in CCLP1
cells, whereas AA exhibited no significant effect (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). In fact, DHA treatment induced a dose-dependent
induction of 15-PGDH in all three human cholangiocarcinoma cells
(CCLP1, SG231, and HuCCT1; Supplementary Fig. S5B–D). The latter
observations are noteworthy, because 15-PGDH is a prostaglandindegrading enzyme that physiologically antagonizes COX-2 and
suppresses tumor growth.

Because DHA reduces PGE2 levels through concomitant
inhibition of COX-2 and induction of 15-PGDH, we postulate that
DHA might also inhibit h-catenin through the inhibition of PGE2.
To evaluate this hypothesis, further experiments were performed to
determine whether DHA might prevent PGE2-induced h-catenin
activation. DHA prevented PGE2-induced phosphorylation of GSK3h as well as dissociation of the GSK-3h/Axin complex (Supplementary Fig. S6). Accordingly, DHA treatment also inhibited
PGE2-induced TCF/LEF reporter activity. These findings suggest
that suppression of PGE2 by DHA represents another mechanism
for h-catenin degradation.
Taken together, our data suggest that N3-PUFAs induce hcatenin degradation through three interrelated mechanisms. First,
we show that DHA and EPA induce a rapid dephosphorylation of
GSK-3h in human cholangiocarcinoma cells, suggesting that GSK3h activation is involved in N3-PUFA–induced h-catenin degradation. This assertion is further supported by the observations that
the GSK-3h inhibitor, SB216763, prevents DHA-induced reduction
of h-catenin protein and transcription activity and restored cell
survival. Second, DHA treatment induces the association of Axin
with GSK-3h forming the h-catenin destruction complex. Third,
N3-PUFAs suppress PGE2 signaling through concomitant inhibition
of COX-2 and induction of 15-PGDH, thus preventing PGE2induced h-catenin accumulation. The involvement of h-catenin
degradation in N3-PUFA–induced inhibition of tumor growth is
further supported by the observation that Wnt3a-CM partially
protects cholangiocarcinoma cells from DHA-induced inhibition of
cell growth.
In summary, this study presents the first evidence that COX-2–
derived PGE2 activates h-catenin in human cholangiocarcinoma
cells and that N3-PUFAs inhibit cholangiocarcinoma cell growth by
simultaneously blocking h-catenin and COX-2 signaling pathways.
Our findings provide important preclinical evidence and molecular
insight for potential utilization of N3-PUFAs in the chemoprevention and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.
