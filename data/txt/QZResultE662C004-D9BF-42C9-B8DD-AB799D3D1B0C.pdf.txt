ABSTRACT:
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignant
hematological disorder arising in the thymus from T-cell progenitors. T-ALL mainly
affects children and young adults, and remains fatal in 20% of adolescents and 50%
of adults, despite progress in polychemotherapy protocols. Therefore, innovative
targeted therapies are desperately needed for patients with a dismal prognosis.
Aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is a common event in T-ALL patients
and portends a poor prognosis. Preclinical studies have highlighted that modulators
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could have a therapeutic relevance in T-ALL. However,
the best strategy for inhibiting this highly complex signal transduction pathway is still
unclear, as the pharmaceutical companies have disclosed an impressive array of small
molecules targeting this signaling network at different levels. Here, we demonstrate
that a dual PI3K/PDK1 inhibitor, NVP-BAG956, displayed the most powerful cytotoxic
effects against T-ALL cell lines and primary patients samples, when compared with
a pan class I PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941), an allosteric Akt inhibitor (MK-2206), an
mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor (RAD-001), or an ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2
inhibitor (KU-63794). Moreover, we also document that combinations of some of
the aforementioned drugs strongly synergized against T-ALL cells at concentrations
well below their respective IC50. This observation indicates that vertical inhibition
at different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network could be considered as a future
innovative strategy for treating T-ALL patients.

INTRODUCTION

2]. T-ALL represents approximately 15% and 25% of
pediatric and adult ALL cases, respectively, and mortality
from T-ALL is still 20% for children and about 40-50%
for adults [2]. For this reason, many research efforts are
currently devoted to the development of targeted therapies

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a
group of neoplastic disorders, arising in the thymus, that
affect lymphoblasts committed to the T-cell lineage [1,

to limit side effects of chemotherapy and to increase

blast cells display different molecular characteristics that
affect disease evolution and prognosis [4]. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that the same histopathological

phenotype could be initiated by different point mutations,
translocations, amplifications, deletions, and epigenetic
modulation of gene expression that may contribute to the
development of the cancer [5]. Actually, in different and
potentially oncogenic strategic points, mutations arise and

allow the tumor cells to support their proliferation and
survival [6]. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade is a crucial
signal transduction pathway involved in cell growth,
survival, and drug-resistance [7, 8]. Cancer cells, that
escape the physiological regulation of this axis, increase
their survival and proliferation [9]. Therefore, it is of
great importance to study new therapeutic strategies
to inhibit this signaling pathway. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
constitutive activation is linked both to the pathogenesis
and to progression of a wide variety of human cancers,
including T-ALL [10-12]. In 50-75% of T-ALL patients,
this pathway is constitutively active and negatively affects
patient outcome [13]. Although several preclinical studies
indicated that inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
could be an effective treatment for targeted therapy of
T-ALL [13], it is still unclear which is the best target in this
highly complex and branched signaling network. Indeed,
pharmaceutical companies have disclosed an impressive
array of inhibitors, targeting various components of this
cascade [14, 15].
With the above in mind, we decided to undertake
a comprehensive study where different inhibitors were
tested under the same conditions, against T-ALL cells
(both cell lines and primary samples from patients)
displaying constitutive PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation.
We analyzed the cytotoxic effects of a pan class I PI3K
inhibitor (GDC-0941, [16]), an allosteric Akt inhibitor
(MK-2206 [17]), a dual PI3K/PDK1 inhibitor (NVPBAG956, [18]), an allosteric mTOR inhibitor (RAD-001
or Everolimus [19]), and an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/
mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) ATP-competitive inhibitor
(KU-63794 [20]). Some of the compounds we tested,
have been approved (RAD-001) or have entered phase I/
II clinical trials (GDC-0941, MK-2206) for solid tumor

treatment. Here, we demonstrated that some of these drugs
had a strong cytotoxic activity against T-ALL cell lines
and primary cells. NVP-BAG956 displayed the highest
efficacy. The combined use of some of these compounds
was highly synergistic. We also documented the cytotoxic
effects of NVP-BAG956 and MK-2006 against a T-ALL
cell subpopulation (CD34+/CD7-/CD4-) enriched for
cancer stem cells (or leukemia initiating cells, LICs). The
use of compounds able to eradicate LICs could reduce the
percentage of treatment failures and decrease the relapse
risk of T-ALL patients.

RESULTS
Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling are
cytotoxic to T-ALL cell lines
The effects of inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling on T-ALL cells were first analyzed by treating
the cells with increasing concentrations of the drugs for 24
h and then evaluating the rates of survival by MTT assays.
It is worth recalling here that all the T-ALL cell lines
we used are PTEN-negative and display a defective p53
pathway [21]. Moreover, Jurkat cells do not express the
inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP1 [22]. Both PTEN and SHIP1
are negative regulators of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling [23].
GDC-0941, a pan class I PI3K inhibitor, was
effective on MOLT-4 cells (IC50= 2.8 µM), whereas
CEM-S, and Jurkat cells displayed a much lower
sensitivity (IC50 > 8.2 µM) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). CEM-R
cells, that overexpress the ABCB1 drug transporter (also
referred to as 170-KDa P-glycoprotein, one of major
determinants of drug-resistance [24]), were resistant to

NVP-BAG956, RAD-001, and KU-63794 for 24 h. Then, cells were collected, lysed, and analyzed by western blotting. An antibody to
β-actin documented equal lane loading (50 µg of protein/lane).

GDC-0941. MK-2206 (an allosteric Akt inhibitor) was
effective in both CEM-S and MOLT-4 cells (IC50 around
1.3-1.4 µM) whereas its cytotoxic effects on CEM-R
and Jurkat cells were much lower (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
Overall, NVP-BAG956, a dual PI3K/PDK1 inhibitor,
was more effective than any other inhibitors tested. Most
cell lines displayed an IC50 for NVP-BAG956 near to or
lower than 1 µM, with the MOLT-4 cell line having the
highest sensitivity to the drug (IC50= 500 nM) (Table 1 and
Fig. 1). The allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor, RAD-001, was
maximally efficacious on MOLT-4 (IC50= 900 nM), while
Jurkat and CEM-R cells were less sensitive. The IC50
for RAD-001 on CEM-S cells was not achieved within
the concentration range we utilized (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
Finally, KU-63794, a dual ATP-competitive mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibitor, was effective on MOLT-4 and CEM-S
cells (IC50= 3-4 µM), while Jurkat and CEM-R cells
displayed a much higher IC50 (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

cell cycle progression, MOLT-4 cells were incubated for
24 h with increasing concentrations of the drugs (0.11 µM) and the cell cycle was studied by means of flow
cytometric analysis of propidium iodide (PI) -stained
samples. All the drugs induced a statistically significant
G0/G1 block and a concomitant decrease in both S and
G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 2A). The induction of
apoptosis was investigated by means of Annexin V-FITC/
PI staining and flow cytometric analysis in MOLT-4 cells.
The drugs that most potently induced apoptosis were MK2206 and KU-63794 (Fig. 2B).

Effects of the inhibitors on PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling in T-ALL cell lines
Western blot analysis demonstrated a concentrationdependent decrease in Ser 473 p-Akt, indicative of
mTORC2 inhibition [25], after 24 h of treatment with
all the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, in all the cell lines
analyzed (Fig. 3). Total Akt levels were unaffected
by the drugs, except for NVP-BAG956 at the highest
concentration employed. S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), an
mTORC1 downstream substrate [26], was also efficiently
dephosphorylated by the inhibitors (Fig. 3). A timedependent study was also performed and documented

MK-2206, and NVP-BAG956 (1 µM) dephosphorylated

downstream target [27]) already after 6 h of treatment

63794, NVP-BAG956/KU-63794, NVP-BAG956/RAD001, and RAD-001/KU-63794 combinations (Fig. 5A).
Notably, result analysis documented the existence of
strong synergisms at drug concentrations well below the
respective IC50 for these drugs in CEM-S cells.
Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the RAD001/KU-63794 combination on cell cycle progression, as
these two drugs strongly synergized at 1 µM (CI<0.15).
It is worth emphasizing here that in CEM-S cells the
IC50 for KU-63794 was 4.2 µM, whereas the IC50 for
RAD-001 was not achieved (see Table 1). After 24 h of
administration of the drug combination, it was clearly
noticeable a marked increase in the percentage of G0/G1
cells and a concomitant decrease in S and G2/M cells when
compared with treatment with either drug alone (Fig. 5B).

Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling synergize
together
Then, it was investigated whether GDC-0941, MK2206, NVP-BAG956, KU-63794, and RAD-001 could
mutually synergize in T-ALL cells. CEM-S cells were
incubated for 24 h with either one drug alone or with a
combination of two drugs at an equal ratio. MTT assays
were then performed. The less effective combinations
were those consisting of GDC-0941/KU-63794, GDC0941/MK-2206, GDC-0941/NVP-BAG965, GDC0941/
RAD-001, MK-2206/NVP-BAG965. Indeed, with these
combined treatments, an antagonism was frequently
detected, and, when a synergism was observed, the
combination index (CI) was usually not lower than 0.6,
indicating a weak synergism (data not shown and Fig. 5A).
In contrast, a strong synergism (CI <0.3) was
observed with MK-2206/RAD-001, MK-2206/KU-

isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood and
characterized by constitutive activation of the pathway.

The effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors on
T-ALL lymphoblast samples, grown in the presence of
interleukin-7 (IL-7), were evaluated by first treating the
cells with increasing concentrations of the drugs and
then analyzing the rates of survival by MTT assays. Four
representative patients are presented in Fig. 6A. A marked
reduction of cell viability at 96 h was detected. The two
most powerful drugs were NVP-BAG956 (IC50 about 0.14
µM) and MK-2206 (IC50 about 0.44 µM).
For this reason, we performed western blot analysis
on patient samples treated for 48 h with MK-2206 and
NVP-BAG956, which demonstrated a decrease in the

levels of Thr 308 p-Akt, Ser 473 p-Akt, p-4E-BP1, and
p-S6RP, while their total levels of expression did not
change.

Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling induce
apoptosis in the CD34+/CD7-/CD4- subset of
patient lymphoblasts

PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling dysregulation play
a key role in the onset of human cancers [29, 30].
Indeed, constitutive activation of this axis is associated
with aberrant cell survival [15] and controls neoplastic
motility, invasion, and metastasis [31]. Recent studies
have suggested that this axis could be a promising target
in T-ALL [32, 33], as in more than 70% of T-ALL patients,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is constitutively activated and
portends a poor prognosis [34]. In light of this, it is very
important to develop new therapeutic strategies against
T-ALL cells aimed to negatively modulate this signal
cascade for improving the clinical outcome of the patients.
Since aberrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation
plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, the

DISCUSSION

Finally, using quadruple staining and flow
cytometric analysis, we investigated whether MK-2206
and NVP-BAG956 could induce apoptosis in a T-ALL
patient lymphoblast subset (CD34+/CD7-/CD4-), which is
enriched in putative LICs [28]. After electronic gating on
the CD7-/CD4- lymphoblast subset, cells were analyzed
for CD34 expression and positivity to Annexin V staining.
After 48 h of treatment, the drugs markedly induced
apoptosis in the CD34+/CD7-/CD4- subpopulation (Fig.

aim of this research has been to test and compare the
therapeutic potential of selective inhibitors, such as
GDC-0941, MK-2206, NVP-BAG956, RAD-001, and
KU-63794. In this study, we tested these drugs either
alone or in combination, against T-ALL cell lines and
primary samples from T-ALL patients. The highest
cytotoxic potential against T-ALL cell lines and patient
lymphoblasts was displayed by NVP-BAG956, a dual
PI3K/PDK1 inhibitor which has been shown to be
effective against BCR-ABL- and mutant FLT3-expressing
acute leukemia cells [18]. Subsequently, NVP-BAG956
has been documented to affect proliferation of melanoma
cells [35]. To our knowledge this is the first time this drug
is used against T-ALL cells. NVP-BAG956 was mainly
cytostatic in T-ALL cell lines and was not a strong inducer
of apoptosis. However, it potently induced apoptosis
in T-ALL primary cells, including a cell subset that is
enriched in putative LICs. GDC-0941 is an inhibitor of
class I PI3K that has entered clinical trials for solid tumors
[16]. In T-ALL cell lines and patient samples, GDC-0941
displayed a weak cytostatic effect. MOLT-4 cells were
more sensitive to GDC-0941 than the other cell lines. The
allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206 [36], that is presently
undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of solid
tumors [17], was more powerful than GDC-0941 in both
T-ALL cell lines and primary samples. Apart from being
cytostatic, MK-2206 also induced apoptosis.
Surprisingly, we found that RAD-001 (an allosteric
mTORC1 inhibitor belonging to the rapalog class [37])
was more powerful than KU-63794, an ATP-competitive
mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor [20], especially in MOLT4 cells. Indeed, ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2
inhibitors are generally considered to be more powerful
than rapamycin and rapalogs [38]. However, RAD-001
and KU-63794 displayed nearly similar weak potency
against T-ALL lymphoblasts.
An interesting observation is that RAD-001
treatment resulted in Ser 473 p-Akt dephosphorylation
in T-ALL cell lines. In most cancer cell types, rapalogs
such as RAD-001, increased Akt phosphorylation
through inhibition of a negative feed-back loop based on
mTORC1/p70S6K/IRS1/PI3K [39]. Inhibition of such a
negative feed-back loop up-regulates mTORC2-dependent
phosphorylation of Akt on Ser 473 and increases cell
survival [40]. However, the rapalog inhibitor CCI-779 has
been reported to cause mTORC2 disassembly and Ser 473
p-Akt dephosphorylation [41]. Thus, it may be that RAD001 disassembled mTORC2 complex in T-ALL cell lines.
This finding seems also to indicate that rapamycin and
RAD-001 effects are not superimposable, as rapamycin
treatment of T-ALL cell lines, under the same conditions
employed here as for RAD-001, did not result in Ser 473
p-Akt dephosphorylation in the same T-ALL cell lines
[21].
A rapidly emerging theme in targeted therapy of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, is that combined “vertical”
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition at different nodes of the cascade often leads to
better results that the use of either single or dual inhibitors.
However, most of the studies performed in this field so
far took advantage of solid tumor models [42-44]. As far
as we know, this is the first report which documented the
superior efficacy of vertical targeting of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway in T-ALL cell lines. Previous evidence
has demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network is
characterized by multiple feed-back loops that finely act
to regulate signal transduction [45]. Hence, the existence
of these loops could limit the antitumor effects of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR inhibitors given in monotherapy settings,
and explains the importance of testing the effects of
combination treatment. Consequently, inhibiting at the
same time at different levels and with different inhibitors
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a possible strategy
to enhance their effectiveness on leukemic cells. It is
remarkable that in T-ALL cell lines, a synergism was
detected for drugs used at various concentrations that
were considerably below the IC50 of the drugs when
administered alone. The most effective drug combinations
in T-ALL lines were those consisting of MK-2206/RAD001, MK-2206/KU-63794, NVP-BAG956/KU-63794,
NVP-BAG956/RAD-001, and RAD-001/KU-63794.
These findings could have a clinical relevance for T-ALL
patients. Indeed, as combinations of these drugs increased
the cytotoxicity, the use of a much lower concentration
of the inhibitors was possible and could considerably
attenuate the toxic side effects. Experiments are underway
to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
the increased cytotoxic effects of these combinations.
Moreover, it is important to emphasize that, in
T-ALL patients lymphoblasts, both MK-2206 and NVPBAG956 were cytotoxic to putative LICs. LICs express
surface markers normally exhibited by stem cells and
they are more resistant to various chemotherapies [46].
Strategies that eliminate these cells could have significant
clinical implications [47, 48]. In conclusion, our results
demonstrated that targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at
different levels in T-ALL cell lines resulted in an increase
of cytotoxic effects and then at least some of tested
inhibitors may represent promising drugs also for their
capacity to target T-ALL LICs.

Cell culture and primary samples

After in vitro treatment, T-ALL lymphoblasts
were fixed in Reagent 1 of the Intraprep Kit (Beckman
Coulter) and permeabilized with saponin-based Reagent
2, as reported elsewhere [49]. Cells were incubated with
an anti-cleaved caspase-3 primary antibody conjugated
to AlexaFluor 488. A rabbit IgG conjugated to
AlexaFluor 488 was used as an irrelevant antibody.
Cells were analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer [49].

The T-ALL cell lines Jurkat, MOLT-4, CEM-S,
and CEM-R (CEM VBL100, drug-resistant cells
overexpressing the ABCB1 drug transporter [49])
were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and penicillinstreptomycin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).
Samples from T-ALL pediatric patients were obtained with
informed consent according to institutional guidelines
and isolated using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences,
Little Chalfont, UK) [50, 51] and were grown in complete
medium [RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% FBS, ITS
(insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite), and amphotericin B].

Flow cytometric analysis of putative T-ALL LIC
This was performed essentially as previously
reported [49]. To detect apoptotic cells, samples were
incubated with Annexin V-FITC. Samples were analyzed
on a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) equipped
with Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter).

Cell viability analysis
MTT
(3-[4,5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl]-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were performed
to assess the sensitivity of cells to drugs, as previously
described [52]. In particular, T-ALL patient lymphoblasts
(2 x 106 cells/ml) were cultured in triplicate in flatbottomed 96-well plates at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Cultures were carried out for 96 h in complete medium
supplemented with 10 ng/ml IL-7. Results were
statistically analyzed by GraphPadPrism Software
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Statistical evaluation
The data are presented as mean values from three
separate experiments ± s.d. Data were statistically
analyzed by a Dunnet test after one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) at a level of significance of p < 0.05
vs. control samples.

leukemias against IGF-IR system: new drugs, best drugdrug interactions, mechanisms of resistance and indicators
of efficacy” (to AMM), MIUR PRIN 2008 (2008THTNLC,
to AMM), MIUR FIRB 2010 (RBAP10447J_003 to
AMM).

Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a
PI/RNase A staining according to standard procedures,
as described previously [53, 54]. Samples were analyzed
on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) with the
appropriate software (CXP, Beckman Coulter).
Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-FITC in T-ALL
cell lines and patient samples
After in vitro drug treatment, T-ALL cell lines and
patient lymphoblasts were washed twice in PBS, labeled
with Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer, stained with PI,
and then analyzed by flow cytometry on an FC500 flow
cytometer [55].

The combination effect and potential synergy
were evaluated from quantitative analysis of dose-effect
relationships, as described previously [57]. For each
combination experiment, a CI number was calculated
using the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
This method of analysis generally defines CI values of 0.9
to 1.1 as additive, 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic, and <0.3 as
strongly synergistic, whereas values >1.1 are considered
antagonistic.
