Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) substrate 2 (FRS2) is an adaptor protein that plays a critical role
in FGFR signaling. FRS2 is located on chromosome 12q13-15 that is frequently ampliﬁed in liposarcomas. The
signiﬁcance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling in high-grade liposarcomas is unknown. Herein, we ﬁrst comparatively
examined the ampliﬁcation and expression of FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS)
and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Ampliﬁcation and expression of the three genes
were identiﬁed in 90% to 100% (9–11 of 11) of DDLS, whereas that of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 were observed in 55%
(41 of 75), 48% (36 of 75), and 44% (33/75) of clinically diagnosed UHGPS, suggesting that these "UHGPS" may
represent DDLS despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated FRS2 protein indicated that the FGFR/FRS2 signaling axis was generally activated in about 75% of FRS2positive high-grade liposarcomas. Moreover, we found that FRS2 and FGFRs proteins are highly expressed and
functional in three high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2, and SW872. Importantly, the FGFR
selective inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a
concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Attenuation of FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2
cell lines decreased the phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT and repressed cell
proliferation. These ﬁndings indicate that analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will more
accurately characterize pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Activated FGFR/FRS2 signaling may play
a functional role in the development of high-grade liposarcomas, therefore, serve as a potential therapeutic target.

Introduction
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) substrate 2
(FRS2) is a member of the adaptor/scaffold protein family that
binds to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including FGFR, the
neurotrophin receptor, RET, and ALK, and is required for signal
transduction from FGFRs (1). The FGFR family of 4 RTKs,
FGFR1/2/3/4, mediate numerous physiologic processes
including cell migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation (2). Deregulation of FGFR signaling is associated with
many developmental syndromes (3). Aberrant activation of
FGFR signaling has been associated with tumor formation,

angiogenesis, and metastasis in multiple cancer types including breast cancer, bladder cancer, multiple myeloma, hepatocellular, and renal cell carcinoma. Clinical studies have also
revealed that aberrant FGFR signaling is associated with poor
outcome of different human cancers (4–7). These observations
make FGFRs signaling increasingly attractive as target for
therapeutic intervention in various human cancers (2).
Liposarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal
tumors, and on the basis of morphologic features and cytogenetic aberrations, liposarcoma is classiﬁed into 3 biologic
types encompassing 5 subtypes: well-differentiated liposarcoma/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDLS/DDLS), myxoid/
round cell liposarcoma, and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS; refs. 8–10). Surgery serves as the
mainstay of therapy for localized liposarcoma. However, for
locally advanced and disseminated disease, there are few
effective treatment options (11). Liposarcomas with similar
morphologic appearance can follow different clinical courses
and show divergent responses to systemic therapy (12, 13).
DDLS and UHGPS share similar histologic features, but compared with DDLS, UHGPS displays more aggressive local
behavior and strong resistance to systemic ifosfamide-based
chemotherapy, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of about 50%
(10). DDLS tends to have a lower metastatic rate (15%–20%)
than UHGPS (30%–50%; ref. 12). However, the accurate discrimination of pleomorphic from DDLS based on morphology

FRS2 and FGFR Signaling Pathway in High-Grade Liposarcoma

alone is often a challenge even for an experienced soft-tissue
pathologist. Recent reports indicate that "UHGPS" has been
misused for several better classiﬁable, poorly differentiated
soft-tissue sarcomas (14). For example, a study reported that
23% of 163 high-grade liposarcomas in the Netherlands Cancer
Institute were reclassiﬁed on the basis of molecular characteristics of liposarcoma (15). Similarly, another study re-evaluated
159 cases of previously diagnosed UHGPS and found that a
total of 97 of these cases could be reclassiﬁed as other sarcomas
and 20 were proven to be nonmesenchymal neoplasms (16).
During the past decade, with the insight afforded by immunohistochemistry as well as improved cytogenetic and molecular diagnostics, the term UHGPS has been restricted to a
group of soft-tissue malignancies without a speciﬁc line of
differentiation (17). Therefore, it is critical to better classify and
target various high-grade liposarcomas based on their speciﬁc
pathologic features.
Ampliﬁcation of MDM2 and CDK4 genes on chromosome
12q13-15 is noted to frequently occur in WDLS/DDLS and may
also serve as genetic characteristics of DDLS from UHGPS. For
example, Taylor and colleagues, using high-resolution genomic
analysis, proved that there was no CDK4 ampliﬁcation in
UHGPS (18). The chromosome 12q13-15 amplicon is discontinuous and spans several megabases of DNA and contains
multiple genes (19). The discontinuous ampliﬁcation may lead
to the patterns for overexpressed proteins that may provide
growth advantages to tumors quite different between patients.
Among genes on chromosome 12q13-15, CDK4 gene, a cyclindependent kinase promoting G1-phase cell-cycle progression,
and MDM2 gene, a transcriptional target of p53, which mediates both ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of
p53 and ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of
p21, causing unchecked cell-cycle progression and proliferation, have been well-studied because of their critical function in
oncogenesis of liposarcoma (20, 21). The FRS2 gene is located
close to CDK4 and MDM2 on chromosome 12q13-15. Most
recently, a study showed that the FRS2 gene is also frequently
ampliﬁed in WDLS, and the FRS2 protein was overexpressed in
WDLS, but not in normal fat or preadipocytes, which then
raises the possibility that FRS2 could be a useful target in
malignant liposarcomas (22).
In the present study, we ﬁrst comparatively analyzed the
ampliﬁcation and overexpression of FRS2 with that of CDK4
and MDM2 in clinically diagnosed DDLS/UHGPS. We discovered a high frequency of ampliﬁcation and overexpression of
FRS2 in these high-grade liposarcomas. Considering that FRS2
acts as "a conning center" in FGFR signaling (1, 2), we further
investigated the activation of FGFR signaling in these malignant liposarcomas. We found that FGFR signaling was activated in 75% of high-grade liposarcomas expressing FRS2
protein. The biologic signiﬁcance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling
in the development of these malignant liposarcomas has not
previously been evaluated, to the best of our knowledge. We
examined expression of FRS2 and FGFRs genes in three human
high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2 and
SW872 and found that FRS2 and FGFRs are ubiquitously
expressed and functional in these cell lines. Furthermore, we
improved that targeting FGFR-FRS2 signaling may inhibit the

www.aacrjournals.org

in vitro growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Our ﬁndings for
the ﬁrst time indicate that activated FGFR/FRS2 signaling may
contribute to the progression of high-grade liposarcomas,
therefore representing a potential therapeutic target that
deserves further extensive study. Recent advances in molecular
characterization of liposarcomas have shown that aberrant
ampliﬁcation of MDM2 and CDK4 genes within chromosome
12q13-15 distinguishes WDLS/DDLS from UHGPS (16–18).
Accordingly, we also validated that a subset of clinically
diagnosed "UHGPS" of current study may represent DDLS.
Importantly, we observed that 7% of these "UHGPS" were
immunopositive for FRS2 only. Our study also suggests that
analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will
even more accurately classify high-grade liposarcomas and
lead to better prognostication.

Materials and Methods
Cellular proliferation and FRS2 siRNA knockdown assays
FU-DDLS-1 DDLS cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Hiroshi
Iwasaki (Fukuoka University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka,
Japan; ref. 23) and was maintained in Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM):F12 medium with 10% FBS. SW872
DDLS cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and was cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. LiSa-2
pleomorphic liposarcoma cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Silke
Bruderlein (University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; ref. 24) and was
maintained in Iscove's modiﬁed Dulbecco's medium/RPMI in a
4:1 ratio supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 0.1 mg/mL gentamicin. All cells were newly DNA ﬁngerprinted to conﬁrm identity as previously described (25).
Human adipose tissue total RNA survey Lot #07505959A and
#0903009 were purchased from Ambion Inc. Human FRS2
gene–speciﬁc siRNA and scrambled siRNA (Life Technologies
Corporation) were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine
siRNA Maximum (Life Science, Inc.) according to the user
manual. FRS2 siRNA–mediated inhibition of FU-DDLS-1 and
LiSa-2 cells proliferation was monitored by using a W200 realtime cell electronic sensing analyzer (RT-CES) 16X workstation
(Acea Biosciences) (26). A total of 2,500 cells were seeded into
each well of RT-CES device in multiple duplicate of 8 and
transfected with siRNAs. Twenty-four hours later, the index
and curve of cell proliferation were monitored and plotted
every half hour. At 72 hours after siRNA transfection, cells were
also collected for Western blot analysis.
FGFR-speciﬁc inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 treatment and
MTS assay
FGFR in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells was speciﬁcally inhibited using NVP-BGJ-398 (BGJ-398) purchased from Novartis
Oncology Inc (27). BGJ-398 concentration ranged from 0.125 to
4 mmol/L, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was served as vehicle
controls. MTS assays were done according to manufacturer's
instructions (CellTiter 96 AQueous Assay reagent; Promega) to
quantify the number of viable cells. Brieﬂy, a total of 2,500 cells
were seeded in a 96-well plate in multiples of 10 wells treated
with NVP-BGJ-398. At 72 hours after treatment, cells were
subjected to MTS assays. A function of the logarithm of

inhibitor concentration was used to produce logistic ﬁt of
percentage cell viability. The IC50 value was determined as the
concentration of compound needed to reduce cell viability to
50% of a DMSO control.
Case selection
The diagnosis of DDLS and UHGPS was done by pathologist
P. Chu. The criterions for UHGPS were as follows: showing
marked cytologic and nuclear pleomorphism, admixed
with spindle cells, without histologic (lipogenic) or immunohistochemical (IHC; epithelial, neuromelanocytic, lymphohematopoietic, and muscular) evidence of speciﬁc lineage
differentiation (28). Seventy-ﬁve such cases arising in various
anatomic locations were selected from the surgical pathology
ﬁles at City of Hope National Medical Center from 1990 to 2010
(Supplementary Table S1). Twenty-six of 75 UHGPS from
retroperitoneum and thigh were previously reported (28). The
mean age was 57 years with 1.2:1 male predominance and all 75
cases were resection specimens: 37 cases from lower extremity,
from upper extremity, 11 from abdomen/retroperitoneum, 8
metastases in lung, 8 from chest/trunk, 2 from head/neck
(Supplementary Table S1). In addition, 11 cases of previously
diagnosed DDLS were also enrolled in the study (Supplementary Table S2). All tumor specimens were resected. All tissues
were routinely ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and
embedded in parafﬁn (FFPE). One parafﬁn tissue block with
tumor was selected from each case. For these cases with
quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) analysis and genome-wide
exon capture sequencing, an adjacent normal fat tissue block
was also selected. All samples were selected under City of Hope
IRB-06206.
Illumina Genome Analyzer (Solexa) whole-exome
sequencing, sequence alignment, various calling,
and annotation
Three micrograms of genomic DNA was sheared and endrepaired. Illumina adaptor oligonucleotides were ligated to the
ends. Ligation products were puriﬁed and enriched with a 12cycle PCR. The enriched PCR products were subjected to the
exon capture procedure using the SureSelect Human All Exon
Kit. The captured products were then used for sequencing and
cluster generation by synthesis using the Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx. Image Analysis and base calling, which was
conducted by using Illumina default pipeline. The sequences
were aligned to the human genome reference sequence
(NCBI36) using Bowtie 0.12.7 (29). All subsequent analysis was
done using customized R scripts. The log2 coverage ratio of
each exon was calculated for tumor versus normal tissue and
median-centered. Log2 ratios were smoothed by DNAcopy 25
using default values and copy number variation was detected
by DNAcopy's circular binary segmentation algorithm (30).
gDNA preparation and q-PCR
The gDNAs of liposarcoma and the paired adjacent normal fat tissue were isolated from FFPE tissue sections using
the QIAamp FFPE DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the
user manual. To characterize the ampliﬁcation of the chromosome 12q13-15 region in UHGPS, we selected FRS2 and

CDK4 and MDM2 genes of the region to measure their copy
number by q-PCR analysis. For each gene, 2 primer pairs for
2 exons were designed. The primer sequences of 2 exons of
CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2 genes are listed in Supplementary
Table S3. q-PCR analysis was conducted in 32 randomly
selected UHGPS cases (Supplementary Table S4) and 15
DDLS cases (Supplementary Table S5) using ABI Prism
7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
b-Globin was used as reference gene. Relative gene quantiﬁcation method was used to calculate the fold change of
gene copy number in a liposarcoma tissue (based on average
of 2 exons of each gene) to gDNA extracted from the paired
adjacent fat tissue (26).
Immunohistochemistry
Commercially available monoclonal antibodies against
CDK4 (Clone DCS-31, 1:50, Invitrogen), MDM2 (Clone IF-2,
1:75, Zymed Laboratories), and FRS2 (Clone H-91, 1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and a FRS2-rabbit polyclonal (1:50,
Proteintech) were used. Anti-total FGFR3 (D2G7E), phosphorFGF receptor (Tyr653/654), and phosphor-FRS2 (Tyr436) antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-FRS2 antibodies
for Western blotting were purchased from R&D Systems
(Clone 462910) and GeneTex (N1N3/GTX103288). All UHGPS
and DDLS cases were stained for CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2 by
immunohistochemistry. Only FRS2-postive cases were subjected to phospho-FRS2 staining. Sections were deparafﬁnized
and rehydrated in graded alcohol. For heat-induced epitope
retrieval (HIER), the sections were subjected to DIVA retrieval
buffer (pH 6.0) in a Pressure Cooker (Biocare Medical) at 98 C
for 60 minutes. The sections were then brought to an automated stainer (DAKO) following the vendor's protocol. EnVision Plus and peroxidase detection methods were used and
counterstained in 50% Mayer's hematoxylin for 1 minute.
Nuclear CDK4 immunoreactivity, nuclear and cytoplasmic
MDM2 immunoreactivity, and cytoplasmic FRS2 immunoreactivity were assessed. Those cases with more than 1% of
tumor cells showing positive staining were assessed as positive.
The staining was graded as þ (1%–5% tumor cells positive),
þþ (5%–24% tumor cells positive), and þþþ (>25% tumor
cells positive; ref. 11).
FISH
To further validate FRS2 gene ampliﬁcation, dual color
FISH was conducted using the FISH-mapped conﬁrmed BAC
probe, RP11-1130G21 (12q15) for FRS2 labeled in Spectrum
Orange (Abbott Laboratories, Inc.) and RP11-433j6 (12p13)
for chromosome 12 centromere labeled in Spectrum Green
(Abbott Laboratories, Inc.) were selected for FISH assays.
After the unstained positron emission tomographic (PET)
slides were hybridized with FISH probes, cells were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).
An Applied Imaging System was used to record images of
representative cells. Two hundred interphase cells were
scored per sample. All sections were scorable. Images were
captured with the BioView Imaging System (BioView). Two
red and 2 green signals (2R2G) are considered normal in a
diploid genome. Because of truncation and overlapping cells,

at least 20% of cells must show an abnormal pattern to be
considered abnormal.
Statistics
Data were collected using an MS Excel spreadsheet. Data
were analyzed using the JMP Statistical Discovery Software
version 6.0 (SAS Institute). Group comparisons for continuous
data were done with the Student t test for independent means
or 2-way ANOVA. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
FRS2 and FGFR expression and activation of the FGFR/
FRS2 axis in DDLS/UHGPS cell lines
We ﬁrst measured the copy numbers of CDK4, MDM2, and
FRS2 genes in 3 human high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FUDDLS-1 (DDLS), LiSa-2 (UHGPS), and SW872 (DDLS). Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the ratios of copy numbers of
CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2 to b-globin were about 7 to 10 in FUDDLS-1, whereas the ratios of these 3 genes were less than 2 in
LiSa-2 and SW872, indicating that the ampliﬁcation of these 3
genes was only present in FU-DDLS-1 cells (Fig. 1A). FGFR/
FRS2 signaling has not been studied previously in high-grade
liposarcoma cell lines. We then examined the mRNA expression of both FRS2 and 4 FGFR genes, including isoforms of
FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 in these 3 cell lines in comparison
with that of human normal adipose tissues by quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The qRT-PCR

analyses indicated that these cells expressed relatively high
level of FGFR1 and various levels of FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4
mRNA (Fig. 1B). The levels of FRS2, FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4
mRNA were substantially higher in these cell lines than that of
normal adipose tissues; especially in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2
cells. Western blot analysis showed the relatively high expression of FGFR1 and FGFR3 proteins in these 3 liposarcoma cell
lines (Fig. 1C). Although the copy number and mRNA of FRS2
gene were higher in FU-DDLS-1, the level of FRS2 protein was
slightly higher in FU-DDLS-1 cells than that in other 2 cells,
which may indicate the presence of posttranscriptional regulation of FRS2 expression. Coincidently, a previous article
reported that for the distinction of liposarcomas, genomic proﬁling appears to be more useful than RNA expression analysis
(19). We found that phosphorylated FRS2 protein was generally
present in these 3 liposarcoma cell lines, and the levels of
phosphorylated FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells in
serum were relatively higher (Fig. 1C). Consistently, a most
recent study showed that high level of phosphorylated FRS2
protein was only present in liposarcoma but not in normal fat
or preadipocytes (22). To determine the cellular responses to
bFGF2 stimulation, these 3 cell lines were serum starved for
about 72 hours and then stimulated with 10 ng/mL of basic
FGF2 (bFGF2) for 30 minutes. As shown in Fig. 1D, bFGF2
stimulation promptly increased phosphorylated total FGFR
(p-FGFR), FRS2 (p-FRS2), extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK)1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and AKT (p-AKT) in all 3 high-grade

liposarcoma cell lines, especially in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2,
showing the presence of a functional FGFR/FRS2 signaling
after bFGF2 stimulation.
Effects of FGFR inhibitor BGJ-398 on FU-DDLS-1 and
LiSa-2 cell proliferation
The FGFR pathway is an important stimulus to cancer
development and progression in many epithelial tumors, and
targeted inhibition of FGFR signaling has shown promise in
in vitro studies (2, 31). As FGFR signaling was highly activated
in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 in serum, we tested the effects of an
FGFR inhibitor on the proliferation and activation of AKT and
ERK signaling in these 2 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, the
selective FGFR inhibitor BGJ-398 signiﬁcantly decreased FUDDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner. The IC50 of BGJ-398 was about 0.25 to 0.50 mmol/L
for FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells, respectively. After cells were
exposed to BGJ-398 for 1 to 8 hours, Western blot analysis
showed that p-FRS2, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 proteins rapidly
decreased in a dosage-dependent manner in FU-DDLS-1 (Fig.
2C) and LiSa-2 cells (Fig. 2D). However, p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT in
FU-DDLS-1 (Fig. 2C) and LiSa-2 cells (Fig. 2D) started to
rebound after 24 to 48 hours of exposure to BGJ-398, which
indicated that undeﬁned feedback mechanisms might reactivate these pathways. In consistent with the low level of p-FRS2
in SW872 cells in serum, the same concentration of BGJ-398
barely inhibited the proliferation of SW872 cells, suggesting its
proliferation in serum may be less dependent on FGFR signaling (data not shown). Overall, above data indicated that
BGJ-398 may suppress cellular proliferation and survival
through blocking FGFR-mediated signaling.

Effect of knockdown of FRS2 on cell proliferation and
response to BGJ-398 treatment
FRS2 is an adaptor protein absolutely necessary for transfer
of signal from activated FGFR. Knockdown of FRS2 blocks
FGFR signaling and suppresses cancer cells proliferation (32,
33). Therefore, we further asked whether knockdown of FRS2
can also disrupt FGFR signaling and then attenuate cellular
proliferation of these high-grade liposarcoma cells. Western
blot analysis showed that knockdown of FRS2 substantially
decreased the p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT in both FU-DDLS-1 (Fig.
3A) and LiSa-2 cells (Fig. 3B) in serum and dramatically
reduced bFGF2-induced p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 in both
serum-starved FU-DDLS-1 (Fig. 3A) and LiSa-2 cells (Fig.
3B), which suggested that knockdown of FRS2 may suppress
the bFGF2-stimulated, FGFR-mediated activation of p-AKT
and p-ERK1/2. We further examined the impact of knockdown
of FRS2 on cellular proliferation of both FU-DDLS-1and LiSa-2
cells. Knockdown of FRS2 signiﬁcantly decreased the proliferation of FU-DDLS-1 (Fig. 3C) and LiSa-2 cells (Fig. 3D) monitored in a real-time growth assay. In all, these data strongly
indicate that knockdown of FRS2 may speciﬁcally block FGFR
signaling in these high-grade liposarcoma cell lines.
Ampliﬁcation of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 genes in highgrade liposarcoma
We initiated a pilot study to explore genomic abnormalities
of UHGPS by conducting whole-exome sequencing on 7 cases
of UHGPS. Sequencing results unveiled 2 large and discontinuous ampliﬁed regions of chromosome 12q13-15 and 12q2224 in one "UHGPS" (Fig. 4A). q-PCR analysis showed that
3 selected genes CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2 on chromosome

FRS2 and FGFR Signaling Pathway in High-Grade Liposarcoma

Figure 3. Effect of knockdown of
FRS2 on the response of FU-DDLS-1
and LiSa-2 cells to bFGF2-activated
FGFR signaling and cellular
proliferation. A and B, knockdown of
FRS2 decreased p-FRS2, p-AKT,
and p-ERK1/2 in serum or serumstarved and bFGF2-stimulated FUDDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells. Twentyfour hours after transfection of FRS2
siRNA, FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 were
starved for 48 hours, stimulated with
10 ng/mL bFGF2 for 30 minutes, and
then lysates were immunoblotted
with indicated antibodies. Lysates
from cells in serum were harvested at
48 hours posttransfection of FRS2
siRNA (Con-siR for control siRNA;
FRS2-siR for FRS2 siRNA). C and
D, plot of RT-CES showed that
knockdown of FRS2 signiﬁcantly
decreased the proliferation of FUDDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells at 72 hours
posttransfection of FRS2 siRNA.

compared with control siRNA.

12q13-15 were ampliﬁed 10-fold compared with saliva DNA of
the same patient (Fig. 4B), suggesting the "UHGPS" may
represent a DDLS. The chromosome 12q13-15 amplicon contains several important genes such as CDK4 and MDM2, which
may play important roles in the development of liposarcoma,
and has been well studied in WDLS/AL/DDLS (34, 35). We
selected 8 genes (DDIT3, TSPAN31, CDK4, HMGA2, DYRK2,
MDM2, YEATS4, and FRS2) mapping to chromosome 12q1315 to compare their ampliﬁcation patterns in 15 cases of DDLS
and 32 cases of UHGPS using q-PCR assays. The results of
q-PCR analysis indicated that the frequency for ampliﬁcation
of DDIT3 and DYRK2 was much lower than others (Supplementary Table S3), indicating that the amplicon was discontinuous. Details for gene ampliﬁcation in individual sample of
UHGPS and DDLS are listed in Supplementary Tables S4 and
S5. The frequency of ampliﬁcation of CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2 in
DDLS was 100% (15 of 15), 93% (14 of 15), and 93% (14 of 15),
respectively, whereas the frequency of ampliﬁcation of CDK4,
MDM2, and FRS2 in UHGPS was 44% (14 of 32), 25% (8 of 32),
and 34% (11 of 32), respectively, indicating that a subgroup of
clinically diagnosed "UHGPS" may represent DDLS despite
lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts (14, 16, 17). Figure
4C and D show the copy number distribution of CDK4, MDM2,

and FRS2 genes in DDLS and clinically diagnosed UHGPS
respectively, indicating the presence of co-ampliﬁcation of
FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 on chromosome 12q13-15.
Immunohistochemical analysis of expression FRS2,
CDK4, and MDM2 proteins in high-grade liposarcoma
Furthermore, we measured the ampliﬁcation and overexpression of FRS2 in high-grade liposarcomas by FISH and
immunohistochemistry. The IHC staining results for each case
of clinically diagnosed high-grade liposarcomas are listed in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. All 11 of 11 cases of DDLS
were positive for CDK4 (100%), 10 of 11 for MDM2 (91%), and 9
of 11 for FRS2 (82%). Accordingly, these 44 of 75 of "UHGPS"
with positive IHC staining for one of CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2
proteins should be reclassiﬁed as DDLS (14, 16, 17). Of note, 5 of
75 cases UHGPS (7%) were positive for FRS2 protein only.
Therefore, we concluded that analysis of FRS2 in combination
with CDK4 and MDM2 will more accurately characterize
pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Table 1 summarized semiquantitative analysis of immunostaining of these
3 proteins in these high-grade liposarcomas. Hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) and IHC staining for 4 typical example cases are
presented in Fig. 5. Dual-color FISH analysis showed that FRS2

gene ampliﬁcation was present in case 1 (originally diagnosed
as DDLS) or case 2/3 (originally diagnosed as "UHGPS"),
whereas immunostaining analysis revealed that these cases
were FRS2-positive. FISH of case 4 (originally diagnosed as
"UHGPS") displayed a normal pattern of 2 red signals of FRS2
gene with 2 green signals of centromere in the diploid genome,
suggesting no FRS2 gene ampliﬁcation was present in the
liposarcoma tissue, which corresponded to the negative FRS2
IHC staining.
Phosphorylated FRS2 protein in high-grade liposarcoma
Activation of FGFR results in phosphorylation of FRS2
tyrosine residues and subsequent sustained levels of ERK
activation and also activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT pathway (36). Phosphorylated FRS2 protein may
therefore serve as a marker for activated FGFR signaling. To
further assess whether FGFR/FRS2 signaling was activated in

these high-grade liposarcoma tissues, we investigated the
phosphorylated FRS2 protein by immunohistochemistry. We
found that 75% of 48 cases of high-grade liposarcoma with
FRS2-positive IHC staining were immunopositive for phosphorylated FRS2 protein, which strongly suggests that the
FGFR signaling was activated and might function in these
liposarcoma tissues. The morphology of a high-grade liposarcoma was revealed by H&E staining (Fig. 6A), whereas IHC
analysis showed strong staining for FRS2 protein (Fig. 6B) and
moderately positive staining for phosphorylated FRS2 protein
(Fig. 6C). Quantitative analysis showed that 37.5% of phosphorylated FRS2-positive high-grade liposarcomas were graded as þ (1%–5% tumor cells positive), whereas 35.4% of them
were graded as þþ (5%–24% tumor cells positive), and 2.1% of
them were graded as þþþ (>25% tumor cells positive). The
IHC staining grade of p-FRS2 for each high-grade liposarcoma
is also listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.

Discussion
FISH analysis or immunohistochemistry analysis of ampliﬁcation and overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 on chromosome 12q13-15 have been proven useful adjuncts in diagnosing
WDLS/DDLS (11, 35, 37) and may also represent genetic
characteristics of DDLS from UHGPS. For example, Taylor
and colleagues proved that there was no CDK4 gene ampliﬁcation in UHGPS (18). Accordingly, in the present study, we
also found that 44 of 75 cases of "UHGPS" should be reclassiﬁed
as DDLS. The FRS2 gene is located close to CDK4 and MDM2 on
chromosome 12q13-15 but has not been well-studied in highgrade liposarcoma. The ampliﬁcation of chromosome 12q1315 is typically large and discontinuous (20), which may lead to
the proﬁles for overexpressed proteins that may provide

growth advantages to tumors quite different between patients.
Consistently, we also observed that the patterns for ampliﬁcation and overexpression of genes on chromosome 12q13-15
are quite heterogeneous among high-grade liposarcoma tissues. Of note, 7% of UHGPS were immunopositive for FRS2
only, suggesting molecular and/or IHC analysis of FRS2 gene, in
combination with MDM2 and CDK4 genes, may more precisely
characterize and stratify high-grade liposarcomas.
The FGFR signaling pathways play a pivotal role in normal
embryonic development. FRS2 gene knockout in mice causes
lethality due to the interruption of the FGFR signaling pathway
(36). FRS2 acts as "a conning center" in FGF signaling mainly
because it induces sustained levels of activation of ERK
(31, 38, 39). FGF ligands and their receptors are overexpressed

in a variety of cancers, including breast, stomach, prostate,
pancreas, bladder, and colon (4–7). Aberrant activation of
FGFR signaling has been associated with tumor formation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis of these human cancers. A
recent study has proven that ampliﬁcation of FGFR1 was
the strongest independent predictor of poor outcome in a
cohort of unselected breast carcinomas (4). Increasing studies have uncovered solid evidences that activated FGFRs are
driving oncogenes in certain cancers and act in a cellautonomous fashion to maintain the malignant properties
of tumor cells. These observations make FGFRs increasingly
attractive as targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer
(27, 31, 36). Many small compounds that inhibit RTKs and
humanized antibodies against RTKs have been developed,
and a number of potent inhibitors of the FGF receptors are
in early-phase clinical trials (2, 27, 40). Most recently, Wang
and colleagues showed that the FRS2 gene was co-ampliﬁed,
overexpressed, and activated in WDLS, but not in benign
lipomas (22). To further investigate the biologic signiﬁcance
of FGFR-FRS2 signaling in high-grade liposarcomas, we
examined phosphorylation of FRS2 protein: the functional
form of FRS2, in these tissues expressing FRS2 protein.
Interestingly, we identiﬁed a very high frequency of phosphorylation of FRS2 in these high-grade liposarcomas, indicating the FGFR signaling was generally activated.
Furthermore, we hypothesized that activated FGFR-FRS2
signaling might have a positive contribution to the development of high-grade liposarcoma and serve as a potential
therapeutic target. To test the hypothesis indirectly, we ﬁrst
measured FRS2 and FGFR expression in human high-grade
liposarcoma cell lines, whereas we found that FRS2 and
FGFR1/3 transcripts and proteins are expressed in all 2
liposarcoma cell lines. The phosphorylated FRS2 in these
cells was signiﬁcantly upregulated by bFGF2 stimulation.
Activated FGFR signaling in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells was
indicated by the strong phosphorylated FRS2 signal in the
presence of serum, whereas phosphorylated FRS2 was very
low in the SW872 cell line. We next investigated the effects of
an FGFR inhibitor on the proliferation and activation of AKT
and ERK signaling of these 3 cell lines. Consistent with the
differences observed for phosphorylated FRS2 between these
cell lines, we found that an FGFR-selective inhibitor significantly suppressed the proliferation of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa2 cells, which have highly activated FGFR signaling, but not

in SW872 cells, which do not. We also found that FGFR
inhibitors suppressed the activation of ERK and PI3K signaling pathways. Similarly, studies on breast cancer cells
showed that PD173074 selectively inhibits FGFR tyrosine
kinase activity, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
and PI3K signaling pathways (41, 42). FRS2 itself is also a
potentially attractive target for disruption of the mitogenic
and tumorigenic effects of multiple FGFs. For example,
studies in prostate cancer showed that knockdown of FRS2
might block global FGFR signaling in vitro and in vivo (32,
33). Our ﬁnding that knockdown of FRS2 in a UHGPS cell
line inhibited cell growth and activation of ERK and AKT are
consistent with this. FGFR signaling can be constitutively
activated by upregulation of FGFs or by ampliﬁcation or
mutation of FGFRs (4–7). Currently, the underlying mechanisms responsible for activation of the FGFR/FRS2 signaling
axis in these liposarcomas remain unknown, therefore, is
deserving of further intensive study. However, our ﬁndings
open a door that leads to dissecting and targeting FGFR/
FRS2 signaling in high-grade liposarcoma.
