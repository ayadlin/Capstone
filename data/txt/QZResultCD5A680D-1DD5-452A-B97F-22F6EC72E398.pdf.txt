ABSTRACT
To investigate how mineral dust-induced gene (mdig, also named as mina53,
MINA, or NO52) promotes carcinogenesis through inducing active chromatin,
we performed proteomics analyses for the interacting proteins that were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-mdig antibody from either the lung cancer cell line A549
cells or the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B cells. On SDS-PAGE gels, three
to five unique protein bands were consistently observed in the complexes pulled-down
by mdig antibody, but not the control IgG. In addition to the mdig protein, several DNA
repair or chromatin binding proteins, including XRCC5, XRCC6, RBBP4, CBX8, PRMT5,
and TDRD, were identified in the complexes by the proteomics analyses using both
Orbitrap Fusion and Orbitrap XL nanoESI-MS/MS in four independent experiments.
The interaction of mdig with some of these proteins was further validated by coimmunoprecipitation using antibodies against mdig and its partner proteins,
respectively. These data, thus, provide evidence suggesting that mdig accomplishes
its functions on chromatin, DNA repair and cell growth through interacting with the
partner proteins.

INTRODUCTION

carcinoma [11], cholangiocarcinoma [12] and breast
cancer [13], exhibited increased expression of the mdig
mRNA or protein. More importantly, the expression level
of mdig appears to be an important prognostic factor for
some cancer patients, especially for those patients with
earlier stages of adenocarcinoma lung cancer or breast
cancer [13, 14]. In the cells with overexpression or
silencing by siRNAs, recent experimental data suggest
that mdig promotes cell proliferation but suppresses cell
migration and invasion [15]. In a mouse lung fibrosis
model, genetic disruption of the mdig gene ameliorates
silica particle-induced lung fibrosis, possibly through
reducing infiltrations of the macrophages and Th17 cells
into the lung interstitium [16, 17].
Structurally, the mdig protein contains a conserved
Jmj C domain that was commonly found in most of

Mineral dust-induced gene (mdig) was first
identified in alveolar macrophages (AMs) isolated from
coal miners who were exposed to mineral dust by working
in the mining industry and had developed chronic lung
diseases [1, 2]. Mdig was also independently identified
in human glioblastoma cell line T98G cells with c-Myc
overexpression and named as myc-induced nuclear antigen
53 (mina53) [3]. Because of the predominant localization
of the gene product in the nucleoli of the cells, this gene
was designated as nucleolar protein 52 (NO52) also [4].

the classic histone demethylases [1, 3]. However,
distinguishing from these known histone demethylases,
the mdig protein lacks domains important for chromatin
binding, such as WD repeats, PHD fingers and/or the
Tudor domain. Previous reports suggested moderate
effect of mdig on tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine
9 (H3K9me3) and the expression of ribosomal RNAs
(rRNAs), H19, IGF2, Myc, Jhdm3a, and X56, a gene
located in the heterochromatin regions [18], indicating that
mdig protein may contribute to the epigenetic regulation
and gene expression. Using peptide screening of mdig
interactors in HEK293T cells, studies by Ge et al [19]
revealed that mdig is able to hydroxylate histidine 39 of
Rpl27a in the HXHR motif, suggesting that mdig may be
a ribosomal oxygenase (ROX). Analysis of the crystal
structural characteristics further demonstrated that mdig
may serve as hydroxylase rather than the demethylase
due to the presence of the C-terminal winged helix (WH)
domain and the distinctive features of the Jmj C domain
[20]. Thus, it is very likely that the influence of mdig on
epigenetics is achieved through its interaction with other
chromatin binding proteins.
Protein-protein interaction has long been viewed
as the basis of physiological activities of any living cells,
such as maintaining the cellular integrity, DNA replication,
gene transcription, signal transduction, and immune
response. Understanding the interaction partners of any
given protein is essential for revealing the physiological
or pathological mechanisms of human diseases [21]. In
the past few years, proteomics approaches using highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) have been widely applied to identify key components
of functional protein complexes [22, 23]. Many of the
protein-protein interaction or so-called interactome
studies, however, were made by overexpressing epitopetagged bait proteins, which might alter the binding
stoichiometry of the proteins investigated. To determine
the authentic interaction partners of the mdig protein,
we employed a straightforward, label-free approach
combining HPLC-MS/MS with co-IP using human cancer
cell line A549 cells and human bronchial epithelial cell
line BEAS-2B cells, respectively [24]. This strategy
allowed us to identify several proteins involved in the
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair and
chromatin binding, including Ku80 (XRCC5), Ku70
(XRCC6), retinoblastoma-binding protein 4 (RBBP4),
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), etc., as
the endogenous interaction partners of the mdig protein.
Additional biochemical analyses indicated that interaction
between mdig and XRCC5/6 sensitizes DNA doublestrand break (DSB) induced by the radiomimetic drug,
phleomycin. These data, thus, may shed new lights on our
understanding of the oncogenic role of the mdig protein
that was overexpressed in a number of human cancers.

Identification of mdig interaction proteins
To enrich the naturally occurring mdig interaction
proteins in the cells, we cultured A549 cells or BEAS-2B
cells under the physiological condition without ectopic
overexpression or metabolic labeling. The capability of
the mdig antibodies in immunoprecipitation (IP) were
first tested by incubating the cell lysates with both the
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that were used
in routine Western blotting experiments. Although both
antibodies were able to pull-down the mdig protein, we
found that the polyclonal antibody of mdig exhibited
higher efficiency in IP (Figure 1A). To identify proteins
that interact with mdig, the immunocomplexes from IP of
the control IgG or mdig antibody was separated by SDSPAGE gels, followed by staining with coomassie brilliant
blue. As shown in Figure 1B, several unique protein
bands were consistently presented in the complexes
pulled-down by mdig antibody, but not in the control IgG
in 4 independent experiments (pointed by arrows and
arrowheads, Figure 1B). To determine the protein identities
of these unique protein bands in the IP using mdig
antibody, the three most clear-cut bands with molecular
weight around 80, 60 and 45kDa (pointed by arrows)
along with the gels at the same positions in the lane of
IgG IP were excised, digested by trypsin and analyzed
by Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid mass spectrometer (MS/
MS). It was unexpected that mdig protein was detected
in all of these bands, possibly due to alternatively spliced
isoforms as we reported before or over-enrichment by IP
and lagging in gel separation (Figures 1B and 1C). The
other proteins in these bands include DDX18, XRCC6,
CENPB, KAT7, TDRD3, RBBP4, ORC5, CBX8, NPM,
etc. (Figures 1B, 1D and data not shown). XRCC6 (Ku70)
is one of the key subunits of the non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) repair complex for the DNA double-strand
break (DSB). RBBP4 and CBX8 had been previously
demonstrated as important components of the Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and PRC1, respectively.
PRC2 silences transcription of the genes through inducing
histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). PRC1,
on the other hand, can bind to H3K27me3 to catalyze H2A
monoubiquitination. Thus, it is plausible to speculate that
mdig may be involved in the regulation of DNA repair and
epigenetic silencing by PRC2 and PRC1.

Mdig is in complexes with XRCC6 or RBBP4
To verify the results of MS/MS, we next examined
the interaction of mdig with its partners through co-IP.
Although more than 15 proteins were detected among the
3 major bands in mdig IP in MS/MS, we initially focused
28270

our attentions on XRCC6, RBBP4, TDRD3, and CBX8
because of their well-known function in DNA repair
and chromatin modification. Endogenous mdig and/or
its partner proteins were immunoprecipitated with the
indicated antibodies followed by Western blotting using
the corresponding antibodies. Indeed, in both A549 cells
and BEAS-2B cells, we found XRCC6 and RBBP4 in the
mdig IP (Figure 2A). Vice versa, mdig was found in the IPs
of XRCC6 and RBBP4, respectively. However, no direct
interaction between XRCC6 and RBBP4 was detected
in A549 cells, suggesting that mdig might form different
complexes with XRCC6 and RBBP4 in these cells. The
antibody we used for RBBP4 has cross reactivity with
RBBP7 (RbAP46) due to higher homologues in amino
acid sequences between these two proteins, which might
explain the subtle difference in protein migration position
in Western blotting (middle panel, Figure 2A).
Co-IP experiments were also conducted to confirm
the interaction of mdig with CBX8 and TDRD3,
respectively. CBX8, a homolog of Drosphila Polycomb
protein, was originally characterized as a central subunit
of the PRC1 complex for transcriptional repression. As

depicted in Figure 2B, we detected interaction between
mdig and CBX8 in A549 cells as well as in BEAS-2B
cells. A marginal interaction between mdig and TDRD3,
a Tudor domain containing protein that was previously
identified as a binding protein of the dimethylarginine on
H3R17me2, was observed (Figure 2C).

The expression levels of mdig affect DNA damage
responses
Considering the direct interaction of mdig with
XRCC6, a molecular scaffold with a ring structure that
recognizes the ends of double-strand breaks (Figures
1 and 2), we further explored the role of mdig on DNA
DSB repair by NHEJ. We first established A549 cell
lines with stable expression of control vector, mdigGFP, control shRNA (shCtrl), or shMdig that silences
mdig. Immunoblotting confirmed overexpression of mdig
by transfection of mdig-GFP or silencing of the mdig
protein by the expression of shMdig (Figure 3A). DSB
were induced by the treatment of the cells with 30 µM
phleomycin for 30 min. Overexpression of mdig did not

Mdig interacts with multiple functional protein
modules

influence the protein levels of XRCC5, XRCC6, or DNA
ligase IV. A modest increase of phosphorylated ATM
(pATM) and phosphorylated DNA-PK (pDNA-PK) was
noted in the cells expressing mdig-GFP and treated with
phleomycin (Figure 3B). The effect of mdig on pATM
and pDNA-PK was additionally confirmed in the cells
expressing mdig-targeting shRNA. Silencing mdig by
shMdig minimized induction of pATM and pDNA-PK
by phleomycin (Figure 3C). These data, thus, suggest that
mdig may enhance the DNA damage responses (DDR) of
the cells treated with phleomycin.

It was very likely that many low-abundant proteins
that interact with mdig in IP couldn’t be visualized as
individual bands in the gel by coomassie blue staining.
To explore additional interaction proteins of mdig,
the IP products of mdig or IgG were separated by one
dimensional SDS-PAGE, and the whole lanes of the
gel were randomly sliced and subjected to proteomic
analysis to maximize the coverage of the mdig-interacting
proteins (Figure 5A). To reduce false positives caused by
nonspecific binding during IP, we prepared IP samples in 3
independent experiments, one of which had 4 replications,
and analyzed in two laboratories using different MS/
MS systems. The resulting set of 207 proteins includes
not only the XRCC6, RBBP4, TDRD3, and others
that we had detected in the first experiment (Figure 1),
but also additional proteins involved in DNA repair,
chromatin binding, RNA processing, gene transcription,
DNA replication, and nucleolar function (Figure 5B).
For those proteins that are important for DNA damage
response and repair, several proteins that are known to
contribute to DNA NHEJ repair were identified as mdiginteracting proteins, including XRCC5, XRCC6, DNA-PK
(PRKDC), RFC1, RFC2, POLD3, etc.. Meanwhile, some
of the proteins identified as mdig-interacting proteins had
previously been shown as chromatin-binding proteins for
epigenetic regulation. For example, RBBP7, a protein
usually found associated with RBBP4 in the Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that binds to chromatin
to catalyze the formation of the repressive chromatin
marker, H3K27me3. It is not unexpected to identify some
mdig-interacting proteins as nucleolar proteins or RNA
helicases, given the fact that mdig is mostly localized in
the nucleoli and involved in the biogenesis of rRNAs.
Interestingly, one of the mdig-interacting RNA helicases,
DDX1, had been previously shown as an important
accessory protein that facilitates repairing of the doublestrand DNA break by clearing RNAs at the damage sites
[25].

Mdig sensitizes phleomycin-induced DNA doublestrand breaks
Above data revealed physical interaction of mdig
with XRCC6 and its involvement in the activation of
two key DNA damage response kinases, ATM and DNAPK, in the cells treated with phleomycin that induces
DSB of the DNA. An early marker of the DNA DSB is
a phosphoepitope that appears on serine 139 of the H2A
variant, H2AX, to form γH2AX in chromatin around the
breakage sites. The level and perpetuation of γH2AX are
not only indicators of DNA DSB but also suggestive of
the repairing capacity of the cells on the damaged DNA.
To determine whether interaction between mdig and
XRCC6 affects the NHEJ repair, we measured the level
of γH2AX by immunofluorescent staining following
phleomycin treatment of the cells with overexpression
or silencing of the mdig protein. As shown in Figure
4A, cells expressing a control vector exhibited marginal
increase of γH2AX in response to phleomycin (top panels,
Figure 4A). A substantial increase of the γH2AX positive
cells was noted in cells with an overexpression of mdig
and treated with phleomycin (bottom panels, Figure 4A).
Silencing mdig by the expression of the mdig-targeting
shRNA (shMdig), on the other hand, reduced the level of
γH2AX induced by phleomycin (bottom panels, Figure
4B). Similar patterns of the pDNA-PK were observed in
these cells with overexpression or silencing of the mdig
(Figures 4C & 4D).
To better delineate the effect of mdig on NHEJ
repair, we performed a kinetic analysis of the DNA
damage response by studying the time courses of
γH2AX and pDNA-PK in these cells described above.
Immunofluorescent staining revealed that about 10% of
the mdig-overexpressing cells were γH2AX positive at 15
min after phleomycin treatment. At 30 min to 1 h, more
than 20% of these cells were γH2AX positive. In contrast,
the frequencies of γH2AX positive cells remained much
lower in the cells in which mdig was silenced by shRNA
(Figure 4E). The patterns of pDNA-PK roughly resemble
the time-dependent changes of the γH2AX in both the
mdig overexpressing and silencing cells (Figure 4F).

Identifying mdig-interacting proteins in other
type of the cells
It has been well known that protein-protein
interaction may differ considerably among a wide
spectrum of cell types due to the varied abundance of
the individual proteins. To investigate whether some
of these mdig-interacting proteins identified above
are ubiquitous or cell type specific, we also conducted
mdig IP and proteomic analysis using BEAS-2B cells
and compared the interacting proteins with those found
in A549 cells. The banding pattern obtained with SDSPAGE is very similar for the BEAS-2B and A549 cell

mdig IP samples. Each mdig IP lane contains three clear
bands that are absent from the control IgG IP (Figure 6A,
indicated by arrows). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
following the proteomic profiling of the mdig-interacting
proteins in these two different cell types revealed a similar
enrichment of the proteins in the pathways of DNA NHEJ
repair and telomere extension (Figure 6B). However,
some pathways are unique in the BEAS-2B cells, such
as signaling pathways of the IL-17A, TNFR1, and aryl
hydrocarbon receptor. Detailed analysis of the proteins
that are isolated with mdig IP suggested that in both A549
cells and BEAS-2B cells, mdig can interact with the DNA
repair proteins, including XRCC5, XRCC6, PAXX, RIF1,
and the arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), histone
H2A (HIST1H2A), Rho guanine nucleotide exchange
factor 12 (ARHGEF12), etc. (Figure 6C). Notably,
several proteins that interact with mdig were detected
only in the BEAS-2B cells (Figure 6D), such as CBX3
(HP1γ), CBX5 (HP1α), CCNB2, CDC5L, CDKL3, etc.. In
addition to their long-established role in maintaining the
heterochromatin states by binding to H3K9me3, the CBX
family proteins had been shown to be capable of binding
to the lysine-methylated DNA-PK and XRCC5 to localize
the DNA repair machinery to DSB sites [26-28].

protein and the expression of rRNA, H19, IGF2, Myc,
Jhdm3a, and X56 [2, 18], it remains to be fully elucidated
whether mdig exhibits its regulatory role on chromatin
or gene expression is achieved through interaction with
other chromatin binding proteins. In the present report,
we employed a strategy of IP in combination with
protein profiling by proteomic analysis to investigate the
endogenous proteins that interact with mdig. Our data
indicate that mdig physically interacts with the NHEJ
repair complex containing XRCC5, XRCC6 and DNAPK in response to DNA DSB. This interaction sensitizes
phleomycin-induced double-strand breaks (DSB) of
the DNA in A549 lung cancer cells. Silencing mdig by
shRNA, on the other hand, alleviated DNA DSB induced
by phleomycin (Figure 4). In addition to the verification
in four independent experiments using two different MS/
MS systems, the interaction of mdig with XRCC5 and
XRCC6 was also confirmed in two other cell types, the
human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (Figure 6)
and human multiple myeloma cell line H929 (Wu et al,
unpublished observations). Taken together, these results
suggested a previously uncharacterized role of mdig,
the participation in NHEJ repair processes of the DNA
DSB. Association of mdig with the complex of XRCC5,
XRCC6 and DNA-PK may weaken the NHEJ repair
capacity (Figures 4E &4F) and consequently, increase the
opportunity of genomic mutation and carcinogenesis in
response to toxins that target genomic DNA.
In addition to the NHEJ repair machinery, both
proteomic analysis and co-IP experiment also unraveled
interaction of mdig with RBBP4 and CBX8, the key
subunits of the PRC2 and PRC1, respectively. Both PRC2
and PRC1 had been traditionally viewed as epigenetic
regulators to promote silent chromatin through H3K27me3
and the ubiquitination of the histone proteins [31]. Recent
studies also revealed rapid recruitment of these two
complexes to the sites of DNA DSB for NHEJ repair [32].
Functional disruption of either PRC2 or PRC1 impaired
the DNA repair process or sensitized DNA to damage
following ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DSB [33, 34].
However, it is unclear at the present whether our findings
that mdig interacts with RBBP4 and CBX8 are suggestive
of mdig’s interaction with PRC2 or PRC1 directly at the
DNA damage sites, despite our co-IP experiments detected
weak association between mdig and the EZH2 protein,
the enzymatic component of the PRC2 complex (data not
shown). Thus, the possibility that these interactions may be
beyond the PRC2 and PRC1 cannot be ruled out. Indeed,
several lines of evidence implied PRC2 independent
role of RBBP4. RBBP4 has long been identified as an
essential subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and
deacetylase (NuRD) complex that regulates chromatin
structure, gene transcription, DNA damage repair, and
aging [35]. Meanwhile, RBBP4 may also be involved
in the activity of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1),
a complex acting as histone chaperone for assembly of

DISCUSSION
In mammalian cells, genomic DNA is constantly
damaged, even in normal homeostasis. A plethora of
environmental factors, such UV radiation, chemicals and
heavy metals, can trigger severe DNA damage [29]. To
prevent accumulative mutations due to DNA damage and
the consequent tumorigenesis, the cells deploy a number
of DNA repair machineries to maintain the stability
and integrity of the genome. These repair machineries,
collectively known as the DNA damage response (DDR),
involve detection of the DNA lesion, initiation and
propaganda of the damage signal, and establishment
of conditions that ensure that DNA repair is started
and completed [30]. In addition to cell cycle arrest and
transcriptional termination at the DNA damage sites,
proper chromatin states, including chromatin remodeling,
nucleosome rearrangement, and histone methylation
and ubiquitination, provide the necessary platform to
coordinate the DDR.
We and others had identified mdig gene from
the human alveolar macrophages and tumor cell lines,
respectively [1, 3, 4]. The mdig protein contains a Jmj
C domain that is viewed as a signature motif of a large
family of histone demethylases that regulate the chromatin
status during DNA replication and gene transcription.
However, mdig protein lacks critical domains for
chromatin binding, such as WD repeats, PHD fingers and/
or the Tudor domain. Despite overexpression or silencing
experiments in certain type of cells suggested involvement
of mdig on the methylation states of the histone H3

nucleosome, restoration of chromatin after DNA damage
and heterochromatin duplication [36]. Furthermore, it is
especially interesting to note that RBBP4 has been linked
to the human aging process with hippocampus-related
memory loss [37]. Inhibition of RBBP4 in the forebrain
of young mice caused a reduction of the HAT activity
of CBP on the acetylation of histone H4 lysine12 and
histone H2B lysine20, leading to memory impairment.
Our gene knockout studies showed that mice with mdig
gene deficiency live longer than their wild counterpart
[13], possibly suggesting an inhibitory role of mdig on
RBBP4 through direct interaction. Partial deletion of mdig
gene might indirectly enhance the function of RBBP4
and postpone the onset of memory loss and other aging
processes.
It is not surprising to detect interaction of mdig
and the CBX3 (HP1γ) and CBX5 (HP1α) proteins in the
BEAS-2B cells. Both CBX3 and CBX5 are H3K9me3binding proteins for the formation of the heterochromatin
and the maintenance of the genomic stability. Our previous
studies in BEAS-2B cells implicated possible involvement
of mdig in the demethylation of H3K9me3 [2, 18]. Thus,
at the global level, such an interaction of mdig and CBXs
may contribute to the balance between euchromatin and
heterochromatin through fine-tuning the binding capability
of CBXs to H3K9me3. At the DNA damage sites, this
interaction may impede the function of CBX proteins

in maintaining suitable chromatin states for DNA repair
and the interaction of CBX proteins with other DNA
repair proteins. A number of studies have demonstrated
involvement of CBX proteins in DNA repair [38]. CBXs
may recruit BRCA1/BARD1 to the DNA damage sites
through direct binding to BRCA1/BARD1 and the
H3K9me3 during homologous recombination (HR) repair
of the DSB [39]. Although the role of CBXs in NHEJ
repair is unclear, they may contribute to the restoration
of the correct chromatin states when the damages are
repaired. However, it should be noted that interaction of
mdig with CBX3 and CBX5 may be cell type specific,
because such an interaction was only observed in BEAS2B cells but not in A549 cells or the H199 cells.
There are a number of other proteins that were
identified as mdig-interacting proteins, such as RNA
helicases and several nucleolar proteins. It is unclear
whether interaction of mdig with these proteins is also
involved in DDR or other independent functions. An
additional interesting protein that was identified as an
interacting protein of mdig in all three different cell lines
is the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) that
specializes in arginine methylation of both histones and
non-histone proteins that are involved in cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis and DNA repair [40]. This interaction between
mdig and PRMT5 may explain the regulatory roles of
mdig on the CD4+ T cells [41], Th2 bias [42] and Th17

cells [16, 17]. It has been shown that PRMT5-catalyzed
symmetrical dimethylation of H4R3 is the most repressive
histone marker for the global expression of the genes
in CD4+ T cells [41, 43]. It is also known that arginine
methylation augments the transcriptional ability of NIP45
on Th2 cytokine IL-4 [44, 45]. Binding of PRMT5 by
mdig, therefore, may antagonize the function of PRMT5,
leading to repression of IL-4 secretion and Th2 cell
differentiation. For the differentiation of the Th17 cells,
binding of mdig to PRMT5, a known JAK-binding protein,
may alter the dynamics of the JAK-STAT3 signaling that
is essential for the specialization of the Th17 cells [46].
Together, our results have unraveled previously
unknown functions of mdig in interacting with the proteins
in DDR and possibly other important cellular processes.
These interactions reinforced the regulatory role of mdig
on epigenetics and chromatin organization, and supported
the idea that mdig can be recruited to specific chromatin

sites through association with its partner proteins that
are able to establish and/or recognize unique epigenetic
markers on the chromatin. By extension, our findings may
help to redefine the structure and enzymatic activities
of the mdig protein, considering the fact that active
interactions with other proteins may alter the positions of
the key domains that influence the substrate accessibility
and the enzymatic activities. Several questions, however,
remain to be answered. For example, previous studies
using peptide screening strategy demonstrated association
of mdig with the ribosomal protein Rpl27a and the
subsequent histidine 39 hydroxylation of the Rpl27a
[19, 20, 47]. Does interaction of mdig with these NHEJ
repair proteins and others as reported here also induce
hydroxylation and alter the activity/function of these
proteins? It’ll be also interesting to know why Rpl27a
was not discovered as an interacting protein of mdig in
the current study using three different cell lines. One

possibility is the limited sensitivity of IP experiment to pull
down the endogenous proteins that associated with mdig.
Additional tests are needed to answer these questions,
define the domains in the mdig proteins that interact with
other proteins and learn the detailed role of mdig in DNA
repair, chromatin organization and tumorigenesis.

Specific gel bands in mdig lanes and regions from
IgG lanes at the same position were excised from the
gel. The gel pieces were first washed with water and 25
mM NH4HCO3, 50% ACN for 15 min each, and then
dehydrated in 100% ACN for 5 min. After rehydrating in
50 mM NH4HCO3, and dehydrating in 100% ACN, the
gel pieces were speed vac’ed dry for 5 min. Proteins were
reduced in 5 mM DTT, 50 mM NH4HCO3; alkylation
with 15 mM IAA, 50 mM NH4HCO3; and overnight
digestion with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) in 25
mM NH4HCO3, 10% ACN. Following digestion, peptides
were extracted from the gel using 50% ACN, 0.05% FA.
The free peptides were then speed vac’ed to dryness and
solubilized in 2% ACN, 0.1% FA. The peptides were
separated by reverse phase chromatography (Acclaim
PepMap100 C18 column, Thermo Scientific), followed
by ionization with the Nanospray Flex Ion Source
(Thermo Scientific), and introduced into an Orbitrap
Fusion™ Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
Alternatively, the peptides were separated and analyzed
through Orbitrap XL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
The human lung carcinoma cell line A549 and
bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
or DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with
10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY),
1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and
1% L-Glutamine, and maintained in humidified incubator
at 37°C with 5% CO2. For cell transfection, a total of 5
× 105 A549 cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates
until they reached 60-70% confluency. Transfections
were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) with mdig-GFP expression vector,
control vector, RFP-conjugated mdig shRNA, and RFPconjugated control shRNA (Origene, Rockville, MD).
Stably transfected clone were established by the addition
of G-418 (500 µg/ml) or puromycin (2 µg/ml) (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY), and selected under fluorescent
microscopy.
Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by constantly
agitating in non-denaturing lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40,
2 mM EDTA, and 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30
min at 4 °C. The proteins in the supernatant were collected
by centrifuging at 12,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, pre-cleared protein
extracts (4 µg proteins for proteomics tests, and 400 µg
proteins for immunoblot experiment) were incubated with
Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
coupled with rabbit polyclonal antibody against mdig,
mouse monoclonal antibodies against XRCC6 and
RbAp48 (RBBP4) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against CBX8, TDRD3, and HBO
(Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), normal rabbit
IgG or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at 4 °C overnight, and the immunocomplexes were
eluted by boiling with 2 × SDS-sample buffer after three
washes with lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved by 10%
polyacrylamide Tris-glycine SDS gels and stained by
coomassie brilliant blue.

Proteome analysis
Abundant species were fragmented with high energy
collision-induced dissociation (HCD). Data analysis was
performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo) which
incorporated the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science). The
SwissProt_2014_03 database was searched for human
protein sequences and a reverse decoy protein database
was run simultaneously for false discovery rate (FDR)
determination. Secondary analysis was performed using
Scaffold 4.2.1 (Proteome Software). Minimum protein
identification probability was set at ≥ 99% with 2 unique
peptides at ≥ 99% minimum peptide identification
probability. The specific mdig-interacting proteins were
determined based on the criteria that the peptides were
detected in three out of four experiments with a Mascot
score higher than 50 and at least a 3-fold higher than
the corresponding control immunoprecipitation. The
interaction map between detected proteins was formed by
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).

Immunoblots
Some of the mdig-interacting proteins were
validated by co immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Protein
samples were pulled down as introduced in co-IP method
from the mdig overexpression and mdig knockdown
cells that were treated by 30 μm/ml phleomycin for 30
min, and lysed by RIPA buffer (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
supplemented with phosphatase/protease inhibitor cocktail

and 1 mM PMSF through sonication and centrifugation.
The proteins were quantified by Micro BCA Protein Assay
Reagent Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After
boiled in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1 mM
dithiothreitol, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE
gels, and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Invitrogen).
Blocked in 5% non-fat milk/Tris-buffered saline with
0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h,
the membrane were incubated sequentially with primary
and the second antibody, followed by image development
using ECL substrates (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA/
Millipore, Billerica, MA) and X-ray film. The primary
antibodies include the mouse monoclonal antibody
against mdig (MINA53) (Invitrogen), Rabbit monoclonal
antibodies against Ku70, RbAp46/48 (Cell Signaling
Technology), CBX8, TDRD3, HBO (Bethyl Laboratories,
Montgomery, TX), Non-Homologous End Joining Panel
(H2A.X, gamma H2A.X pS139, DNA Ligase IV, Ku70,
Ku80), DNA Damage Kinases Panel (ATM, ATM phospho
S1981, DNA-PKcs, DNA-PKcs phospho S2056) (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA). The second antibodies include mouse
monoclonal SB62a Anti-Rabbit IgG light chain (HRP) and
Rat monoclonal H139-52.1 Anti-Mouse kappa light chain
(HRP).
