ABSTRACT
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are being tested extensively for
their role in the treatment and prevention of several cancers. Typically NSAIDs exhibit
anti-tumor activities via modulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent mechanisms,
however, an anti-cancer NSAID tolfenamic acid (TA) is believed to work through COXindependent pathways. Results from our laboratory and others have demonstrated
the anti-cancer activity of TA in various cancer models including pancreatic cancer. TA
has been shown to modulate certain cellular processes including, apoptosis, reactive
oxygen species and signaling. In this study, molecular profiling was performed to
precisely understand the mode of action of TA. Three pancreatic cancer cell lines,
L3.6pl, MIA PaCa-2, and Panc1 were treated with TA (50 µM for 48 h) and the changes
in gene expression was evaluated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene ST
Array platform. Microarray results were further validated using quantitative PCR for
seven genes altered by TA treatment in all three cell lines. Functional analysis of
differentially expressed genes (2 fold increase or decrease, p < 0.05) using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis software, revealed that TA treatment predominantly affected
the genes involved in cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, and cell death and
survival. Promoter analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that they
are enriched for Sp1 binding sites, suggesting that Sp1 could be a major contributor
in mediating the effect of TA. The gene expression studies identified new targets
involved in TA’s mode of action, while supporting the hypothesis about the association
of Sp1 in TA mediated effects in pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

treatment. The strategies involving combination treatment
with plant derivatives showed effective response in some
cancers [6] and such strategies are under investigation
for pancreatic cancer [7]. Like many cancers, there is
indication that inflammation plays an important part
in pancreatic cancer initiation. There is also growing
evidence demonstrating the role of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cancer prevention
and as anti-cancer agents. Meta-analysis and data from
clinical trials have shown that NSAIDs, such as aspirin,
can reduce the risk of certain cancers including pancreatic
and colorectal cancer [8, 9]. The anti-cancer activity of
NSAIDs is associated with the disruption of a variety
of cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and

Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with
poor prognosis and a median survival of 4–6 months.
It is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths
in the United States with a 5-year survival rate of about
5–6 % [1]. It remains undetected and asymptomatic in the
initial stages, and is usually diagnosed when it reaches a
metastatic stage, and surgery, chemotherapy and radiation
have minimal effect on survival at this stage. Signaling,
reactive oxygen species and transcription factors such as
NF-kB are known to play critical role in pancreatic cancer
[2–5]. Due to high aggressive nature of this malignancy,
traditional chemotherapy is not often effective for

angiogenesis and can occur in a cyclooxygenase (COX)dependent or COX-independent manner [10–13].
Studies from our laboratory and others using the
NSAID tolfenamic acid (TA) have demonstrated its
potential as an anti-cancer agent in several cancer models
including pancreatic cancer [14–18]. We have also shown
that TA acts as a chemopreventive agent [19]. The anticancer activity of TA is associated with the degradation of
the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor and the
inhibition of expression of its downstream targets such as
cMet, VEGF, and Survivin [15, 16, 18]. Unlike many other
anti-cancer NSAIDs, TA works via a COX-independent
mechanism and, accordingly, has a significantly reduced
toxicity profile [20]. Decrease in Sp1 protein expression
by TA treatment has been demonstrated in several cancer
models, both in vitro and in vivo [14–16]. It has also been
shown that TA treatment leads to cell cycle arrest, increase
in apoptosis, and induction of ROS [15, 16, 21]. In this
study we analyzed the gene expression profiles of three
pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with 50 µM TA, with
the aim of identifying genes or pathways affected by TA
treatment.
RNA from three pancreatic cancer cell lines (L3.6pl,
MIA PaCa-2, and Panc1) treated with physiologically
relevant dose of TA (50 µM) was profiled to identify
differential gene expression using human GeneChip 1.0
ST Arrays (Affimetrix). Classification of these genes using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that they could be
grouped into functional categories, specifically cell cycle,
proliferation, and cell death. Promoter analysis of the
differentially expressed genes identified an enrichment of
Sp1 binding sites, suggesting that many of the identified
genes could be regulated by the Sp1 transcription factor.
This study corroborates our earlier findings and highlights
the importance of targeting Sp1 and its downstream targets.

Array), for each of the three cell lines are shown in
Table 1. A total of 957 (2601) genes were differentially
expressed in L3.6pl, 318 (1317) genes in MIA PaCa-2, and
243 (1226) genes in Panc1 at fold change of ≥ 2 (or 1.5)
and p < 0.05 by TA treatment for 48 h (Table 1). This data
suggests that TA treatment had a greater effect on gene
expression in L3.6pl cells compared to MIA PaCa-2 or
Panc1 cells. This is also reflected in the cell viability data,
where L3.6pl cells were more sensitive to TA treatment
compared to the other two cell lines (data not shown).
The majority of the genes differentially expressed
by TA treatment in L3.6pl cells were found to be
downregulated (704 down vs. 253 up), while the majority
of genes affected by TA in MIA PaCa-2 were upregulated
(211 up vs. 107 down). In Panc1, slightly more genes were
downregulated by TA treatment (137 down vs 106 up). A
subset of 35 genes were differentially expressed (≥ 2.0) in
all three cell lines (Venn diagram Figure 2), of which 21
were upregulated and 14 downregulated (Table 2).

Validation of microarray data
Gene expression changes, induced by TA and
identified by the microarray analysis, were confirmed by
quantitative PCR. Seven genes CENPF, KIF20A, LMNB1,
MYB, SKP2, CCNE2, and DDIT3 were selected for
validation studies (Table 2). Except for DDIT3, all other
genes were downregulated by TA treatment. Also, six of
these genes were differentially expressed in all three cells
lines. CCNE2 was commonly expressed between L3.6pl
and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines only. Quantitative PCR was
carried out using TaqMan gene expression assay. As seen
in Figure 3, the results of the qPCR analysis correlated
with results from the microarray for all the three cell lines.

Pathway analysis

RESULTS

Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software was used
to map the genes that were significantly affected by TA
treatment in the three cell lines according to pathways,
biological process, and disease classification. Also,
relevant networks were explored using the IPA software.
Table 3 shows the top five Molecular and Cellular
functions to which the differentially expressed genes were
mapped in the three cell lines. It is evident from the data
that a set of genes related to Cell Cycle, Cell Growth and
Proliferation, and Cell Death and Survival are altered
by TA in all the three pancreatic cancer cell lines. Not
surprisingly, cancer and gastrointestinal disease categories
were in the top five networks affected by TA treatment
(data not shown).

Genes expression regulation by TA treatment
Differential gene expression by TA treatment in
three pancreatic cancer cell lines L3.6pl, MIA PaCa-2,
and Panc1 was determined using Human GeneChip 1.0
ST array. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the
Euclidian distance-generating function with probe sets
differentially expressed in the microarray analysis. Our
results showed that samples were distributed into two
well-differentiated clusters (Figure 1). The first cluster
contained samples from L3.6pl cells and the other cluster
contained samples from MIA PaCa-2 and Panc1 cells. The
dendrogram further branched into two groups; untreated
and treated samples (Con and TA treated). The hierarchical
clustering analysis suggests that distinct set of genes are
upregulated by TA treatment in each of the three cell lines.

the differentially expressed genes by TA treatment are
regulated by Sp1, promoter analysis was performed
using the program Clover. Clover is an online resource
that looks for enrichment of transcription factor binding
sites. Promoter sequence (1 Kb upstream) for the genes
differentially expressed by TA in each of the three cell
lines was subject to analysis using Clover to determine the
number of putative Sp1 binding sites. As seen in Figure 4,
promoter analysis reveals that there are multiple Sp1
binding sites in the promoter regions of the genes, with
70–80% of the genes having at least ten Sp1 binding sites
in all three cell lines.

demonstrated that both non-selective and COX-2 selective
NSAIDs induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells by
activating death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial
pathway [29]. A more recent study, also using microarray
expression profiling, showed that anti-proliferative and
anti-cancer activity of the NSAID ibuprofen results
from the changes in expression of genes associated with
biological oxidation, cell cycle, and apoptosis [30].
Our lab has been studying the NSAID tolfenamic
acid (TA) as a potent anti-cancer agent. We and others
have demonstrated its anti-cancer activity (both in vitro
and in vivo) in several cancer models, including pancreatic,
colon, lung, prostate, ovarian, and breast [14–17, 31, 32].
The anti-cancer activity of TA was shown to be associated
with the degradation of the Sp (specificity protein) family
of transcription factor and its downstream targets [18].
In pancreatic cancer, TA inhibited the proliferation of
pancreatic cancer cells and tumors in mice [14]. This was
associated with a decrease in Sp1 protein levels and its
downstream targets VEGF and survivin [14, 18]. Sp1
belongs to the Sp family of transcription factors that
includes Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4, all of which are shown to be
involved in numerous biological processes [33, 34]. Sp1
has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers and is
associated with poor prognosis [35–37]. It regulates genes
associated with cell proliferation (cyclin D, cyclin E,
Cdk2, E2F-1, c-Myc), metastasis (VEGF), and apoptosis
(survivin, XIPA), all of which contribute to the hallmarks
of cancer [33, 34]. These studies highlight the importance
of Sp1 in cancer, thus making it an ideal target for therapy.
Numerous compounds, including the NSAIDs such as TA,
have been shown to target Sp1 and inhibit the expression
of its downstream targets [34, 38].
In this study we carried out microarray based
gene expression analysis to understand the mechanism
underlying the anti-cancer activity of TA and identify
potential new biomarkers. Our aim was to gain insights

DISCUSSION
Prognosis for pancreatic cancer remains poor despite
advances made in chemotherapies and surgical treatment
modalities. The very low 5-year survival rate has not
only prompted the search for novel treatment strategies
but has also focused attention on chemoprevention as an
alternative strategy. In this regard NSAIDs have recently
been the focus of many studies as they possess both
chemopreventive as well as anti-cancer properties [22].
Meta-analysis of population based studies provides
evidence that long term use of NSAIDs (such as aspirin
and ibuprofen) provide protection against the risk of
developing certain cancers such as colon, pancreatic,
breast, and prostate [23–25]. Since a majority of the
NSAIDs target either the COX-1, or COX-2 enzymes,
the mechanism of action underlying their anti-cancer and
chemopreventive properties was thought to be mediated by
COX-dependent mechanisms. However, there is growing
evidence suggesting that COX-independent mechanisms
also play an important role. For example, NSAIDs have
been shown to regulate cell death and survival by targeting
PPARδ, the NF-κB pathway, TGF-β, and the lipoxygenase
pathway [26–28]. A study using microarray technology

into pathways or processes, influenced by TA, that affect
proliferation and induce apoptosis using a pancreatic
cancer model. Our results indicate that the profile for
the differentially expressed genes in the three pancreatic
cancer cell lines was different (Figure 1). This is not
surprising as our earlier results with cell proliferation
showed that the three cell lines respond differently to TA
treatment [18], with IC50 values of 42.3 µM for L3.6pl,
68.23 µM for MIA PaCa-2 and 57.50 µM for Panc1.
L3.6pl had the most differentially expressed genes (fold
change ≥ 2, p-value ≤ 0.05) compared to MIA PaCa-2 or
Panc1 cells (Table 1). Pathway analysis was carried out
using IPA software to determine the functional significance
of the differentially expressed genes within the three cell
lines. Our results indicate that TA treatment affects similar
pathways in the three cell lines; ‘Cell Cycle’, ‘Cell Growth
and Proliferation’, and ‘Cell Death and Survival’ (Table 3).
This data correlates with similar microarray studies
performed using NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, NS-398,
and indomethacin, which showed that these compounds
also affect genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell
proliferation and apoptosis [29, 30, 39]. Our previous

studies have shown that TA targets the degradation of the
Sp1 transcription factor in pancreatic cancer cells [18]. A
recent microarray study showed that knockdown of Sp1
using siRNA leads to alteration in genes related to Cell
death and survival, and Cell growth and proliferation [40],
similar to our observations with TA. This suggests that the
differential gene expression by TA treatment is mediated
via its effects on Sp1 transcription factor.
To determine if the differentially expressed
genes in the three cell lines are regulated by Sp1 we
analyzed the promoters of these genes for enrichment
of transcription factor binding sites using the CLOVER
program. Results indicate that there is enrichment for Sp1
binding sites within the promoters, strongly suggesting
possible regulation of these genes by the Sp1 transcription
factor (Figure 4). We were also able to validate the
microarrays data using quantitative PCR using TaqMan
probes for seven genes that are differentially expressed
in all the three cell lines, CCNE2, CENPF, DDIT3,
KIF20A, LMNB1, MYB, and SKP2 (Figure 3). There
is evidence in the literature demonstrating the role of
these TA targeted genes in cancer. CCNE2 (CyclinE2)

TX). The cell were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) with high glucose (4500 mg/L)
and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, in a 37°C
incubator with 5% CO2. All three cell lines were used for
the microarray analysis and quantitative PCR.

Treatment
Tolfenamic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) and a 50 mM stock solution was prepared
in DMSO. For treatment, cells were cultured overnight in
a 100 mm dish. TA (50 µM) was added directly to the
media and the cells cultured for additional 48 h. Control
cells were treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO.

treated cells using TRIzol reagent. RNA was further purified
using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown,  MD).
RNA yields were quantified using A260/280 and the
quality assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyze (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
Microarray analysis was performed using
Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) that consists of
approximately 764,885 probe sets with a resolution
number of 26 probes per gene, covering over 28,869
genes. The entire process was performed following the
manufacturers’ instructions. Briefly, 500 ng of total
RNA was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA by
a chimerical oligonucleotide with oligo-dT and T7 RNA
polymerase. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared by linear
amplification of the poly(A)+ RNA population within the
total RNA sample. Exogenous positive controls were
spiked into the total RNA before cDNA synthesis and were
used to monitor the amplification and labeling process
using a GeneChip® Eukaryotic Poly-A RNA Control Kit
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The quantity and quality of
the cRNA was assayed by spectrophotometry and using the
Agilent Bioanalyzer. Biotinylated cRNA preparation was
fragmented to uniform size and placed in hybridization
cocktail containing biotinylated hybridization controls
(GeneChip® Expression Hybridization Controls,
Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto a GeneChip®

Human Gene 1.0 ST Array at 45°C with 60 rpm for 17
hours in a Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA). Microarray scanned images were obtained
with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA) using the default settings. Images were visually
inspected to eliminate hybridization artifacts.

Statistical analysis
Expression Console software (Affimetrix) was used
to process the scanned images from arrays (gridding and
feature intensity) and the data generated for each feature
on the array were analyzed with GeneSpring software
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Raw intensity
data for each gene on every array were normalized to the
median intensity of the raw values from that array. Data for
all arrays were filtered for intensity values that were above
background in at least two of any set of three replicates
for any condition within each drug treatment. To ensure
that genes were reliably measured, ANOVA was used to
compare the means of each condition (n = 3). Cutoff ratios
> 2.0 and < 0.5 and  P  < 0.05 relative to the respective
control group were selected for this study. Hierarchical
cluster analysis using Euclidean distance was performed
to cluster genes and samples to generate a heat map. Gene
network and pathway analysis were performed using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (http://www.ingenuity.com).

Figure 4: Promoter analysis. Promoter sequences (1 kb upstream of transcription site) of the differentially expressed genes (fold
change ≥ 1.5; p-value ≤ 0.05) were subject to analysis using the CLOVER program. The figure shows the number of putative Sp1 binding

The functional significance of genes differentially
expressed by TA treatment was evaluated using the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity
Systems version 6.3-1402). Genes with a fold change of
> 1.5 and P < 0.05 were selected for network generation
and pathway analyses implemented in IPA tools. GenBank
IDs of the selected genes were uploaded into the IPA,
which were mapped to the functional networks available
in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base. Networks are
composed of biological functions assigned to networks
using significant  P-values for focus gene functions
compared with the whole Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge
Base. Focus genes were identified as the subset having
modeled interaction(s) with the other molecules in the
database. A maximum of 35 molecules comprised a
network. Each network was given a score reflecting the
negative logarithm of the P value based on the chance
of the significant molecules falling into the network by
random. A score of 2 implies that there is a 1 in 100 chance
that the focus genes are together in a network because of
random chance. Therefore, scores of ≥ 2 have at least a 99%
confidence of not being generated by random chance alone.

Hierarchical clustering
Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed
using a complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of a
centered correlation similarity matrix with genes from
the intrinsic gene list previously described. Genes were
filtered and visualized, using the hclust function in R
Package (V3.2.5).

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA, extracted from control and TA treated
cells was converted into single-stranded cDNA using
Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative
PCR was performed with this cDNA using TaqMan
gene expression assay for the selected genes and 96-well
LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR system (Roche, Pleasanton,
CA). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and GAPDH
was used as endogenous control. The Assay ID’s for the
selected genes were, CENPF (Hs01118845_m1), KIF20A
(Hs00993573_m1), LMNB1 (Hs01059210_m1), MYB
(Hs00920556_m1), SKP2 (Hs01021864_m1), DDIT3
(Hs00358796_g1), and CCNE2 (Hs00180319_m1).
The threshold cycle (CT) of the endogenous control
was used to normalize target gene expression (ΔCT) to
correct for experimental variation. The relative change in
gene expression (ΔΔCT) was used to compare the gene
expression in TA treated samples versus DMSO control.
Gene expression results are presented as fold-change of
TA treated sample with respect to DMSO control using
the ΔΔCT method. Differences between the groups were
