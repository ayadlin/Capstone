ABSTRACT
Esophageal cancer remains a poor prognosis cancer due to advanced stage of
presentation and drug resistant disease. To understand the molecular mechanisms
influencing response to chemotherapy, we examined genes that are differentially
expressed between drug sensitive, apoptosis competent esophageal cancer cells
(OE21, OE33, FLO-1) and those which are more resistant and do not exhibit apoptosis
(KYSE450 and OE19). Members of the ISG15 (ubiquitin-like) protein modification
pathway, including UBE2L6 and ISG15, were found to be more highly expressed in the
drug sensitive cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of these proteins
to the response of drug sensitive cells. Depletion of UBE2L6 or ISG15 with siRNA
did not influence caspase-3 activation or nuclear fragmentation following treatment
with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We assessed autophagy by analysis of LC3II expression
and Cyto-ID staining. Depletion of either ISG15 or UBE2L6 resulted in enhanced
endogenous autophagic flux. An increase in autophagic flux was also observed
following treatment with cytotoxic drugs (5-FU, rapamycin). In ISG15 depleted cells,
this increase in autophagy was associated with improved recovery of drug treated
cells. In contrast, UBE2L6 depleted cells, did not show enhanced recovery. UBE2L6
may therefore influence additional targets that limit the pro-survival effect of ISG15
depletion. These data identify UBE2L6 and ISG15 as novel inhibitors of autophagy,
with the potential to influence chemosensitivity in esophageal cancer cells.

cisplatin induce apoptotic cell death in drug sensitive
OE21 and OE33 esophageal cancer cell lines. In contrast,
treatment of apoptosis resistant cell lines KYSE450 and
OE19 results in induction of autophagy and subsequent
recovery following withdrawal of the drug [5]. Autophagy
is a highly conserved process that catabolises and recycles
damaged organelles and protein complexes. This process
can be triggered when a cell is exposed to stressful
conditions such as nutrient deprivation, cellular damage
and hypoxia [6]. In the case of a healthy cell, this can have
a positive, protective function. However, an established
cancer cell can exploit this process to facilitate survival
when treated with a cytotoxic agent, resulting in tumour
cell resistance and cancer recurrence [7, 8].
We undertook gene expression analysis of the
sensitive and resistant esophageal cancer cells lines in

INTRODUCTION
Cancers of the esophagogastric region are highly
malignant tumours with European 1-year and 5-year
survival rates of 40 % and 12 % respectively, according
to the 2015 EUROCARE-5 study [1]. The current gold
standard of treatment involves both chemotherapeutic
intervention and surgery to remove the primary tumour
[2, 3]. However, in the long term, this approach is
often unsuccessful due to the survival of drug resistant
disseminated cells that can recover from treatment [4].
There is therefore a major need to develop new approaches
to treat both primary and recurrent esophageal cancer.
A highly significant factor contributing to drug
resistance is the inactivation of apoptosis in cancer
cells. We have previously shown that 5-fluorouracil and

order to identify patterns of gene expression associated
with cellular response to cytotoxic drug. We found that
several members of the ISG15 conjugation pathway are
upregulated in apoptosis & autophagy competent cell
lines (OE21 and OE33) and downregulated in cell lines
which are apoptosis resistant and which respond to drug
treatment by inducing autophagy only (KYSE450 and
OE19).
Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) is a 15 kD
ubiquitin-like protein modifier which can be conjugated
to protein substrates in order to modify their functions.
Stimulation by Type I Interferons (IFN α or β) activates
the transcription of over 2000 Interferon Stimulated Genes
(ISGs) (reviewed in [9, 10, 11]). Among these ISGs are
three key enzymes: UBE1L (ISG15 specific E1 activating
enzyme), UBE2L6 (ISG15/ubiquitin E2 conjugating
enzyme) and HERC5 (ISG15 specific E3 ligase). In a
mechanism similar to ubiquitination, ISG15 is conjugated
to targets via the sequential co-operation of these E1,
E2 and E3 enzymes. Finally, USP18 (an ISG15 specific
isopeptidase enzyme) can reverse ISG15 conjugation of
target proteins.
Over 300 substrates for ISG15 modification
have been reported. These include existing and newly
synthesised proteins involved in proliferation, chromatin
remodelling, cell cycle regulation and innate immune
system activation [12, 13, 14]. The ISG15 pathway
has been found only in higher eukaryotic cells, indicating
specialised functions [15]. Importantly, UBE2L6 is not
restricted to ISGylation as it can also function as an
E2 enzyme in the conjugation of ubiquitin to target
proteins [16].
In this study, we have identified ISG15 and UBE2L6
as negative regulators of autophagy in esophageal cancer
cells. As the effects of UBE2L6 siRNA on autophagy are
consistent with ISG15 siRNA, it is possible that UBE2L6
influences autophagy by promoting direct conjugation
of ISG15 to targets which directly or indirectly regulate
autophagy.
It is notable however, that the effects of ISG15
and UBE2L6 depletion on overall survival are different.
This is perhaps unsurprising as UBE2L6 can facilitate
ubiquitination, which will expand its repertoire of targets
and thus impact its overall biological effect.

apoptosis in response to drug treatment and instead,
respond by inducing autophagy alone. These cell lines
are more drug resistant and can recover following drug
withdrawal. We reasoned that these two groups may differ
in the genes that they constitutively express, and this may
affect their response to cytotoxic stress. We conducted
Affymetrix gene array analysis of all four cell lines in
triplicate. The array hybridisation and bioinformatics
was carried out by Almac Diagnostics (www.almac.
com; methods are included in Supplementary Figure 1).
We initially identified a list of genes that were common
to group A (apoptosis & autophagy cells) and a separate
list of genes that were common to group B (autophagy
only cells). Each group contained one adenocarcinoma
and one squamous cell carcinoma cell line. Genes which
differed due to histological subtype were eliminated
at this stage. We then looked for genes that are always
expressed in the same direction in Group A (apoptosis &
autophagy competent) but differentially expressed in
Group B. 260 genes had more than a three-fold difference
in the level of expression between the apoptosis competent
(OE21, OE33) and apoptosis incompetent, autophagy only
(KYSE450 and OE19) cell lines. Biological data on these
genes was assimilated and STRING analysis was used to
look for associated protein networks. One of the nodes
identified by STRING included the most differentially
expressed gene (UBE2L6; 17-fold differential) and several
other members of the ISGylation network including ISG15
itself (Figures 1A and 1B). We therefore selected UBE2L6
and ISG15 for further analysis. Differential expression in
the cell lines was confirmed by Western blot. These data
confirm a significant difference in UBE2L6 and ISG15
protein expression between the apoptosis competent and
apoptosis incompetent cell lines (Figures 1C and 1D).

siRNA targeted against UBE2L6 or ISG15 has
no influence on the induction of apoptosis
We initially examined whether the expression levels
of UBE2L6 or ISG15 were important for the induction
of apoptosis in OE21 cells treated with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU). Activation of caspase-3, a standard biochemical
marker of apoptosis, was quantitated by flow cytometry
and morphological features of cell death examined, in
drug treated cells, in the presence or absence of UBE2L6
or ISG15 siRNA (Figure 2).
siRNA mediated depletion of UBE2L6 was
confirmed by Western blot (Figure 2A). OE21 cells are
relatively drug sensitive and activate caspase-3 in response
to treatment with 5-FU. OE21 cells with UBE2L6 siRNA
alone or in the presence of 5-FU (30 μM) for 48 hr (upper
and lower right panels), induced similar levels of activated
caspase-3 as the scrambled controls (upper and lower left
panels). Data from triplicate experiments is presented as
“% caspase positive cells” to the right. Examination of
cell morphology also identified similar levels of apoptotic

Activation of caspase-3 was also examined in ISG15
depleted cells. siRNA mediated depletion of ISG15 was
confirmed by Western blot (Figure 2D). ISG15 depleted
cells showed similar levels of active caspase-3 to
scrambled control cells in the absence (Figure 2E upper

in ISG15 depleted and scrambled control cells treated with
5-FU (Figure 2F arrows).
A colony formation assay was performed to evaluate
the ability of these cells to recover from treatment with

5-FU. In cells transfected with UBE2L6 siRNA, there
was no significant difference in the recovery of cells
following 5-FU treatment [Figure 2G (i)]. In contrast, cells
transfected with ISG15 siRNA demonstrated a significant
rescue from 5-FU relative to scrambled controls (**p =
0.0089) [Figure 2G (ii)] (data is presented as integrated
intensity and colonies shown are representative of three

by ISG15 siRNA (lane 2). In cells treated with 5-FU in
the presence of chloroquine (Figure 3F), LC3II levels
were also further enhanced by ISG15 siRNA, indicating
elevated autophagic flux.
The Cyto-ID assay was used to confirm these
findings (Figure 3G). A significant increase in fluorescence
is observed in ISG15 depleted cells treated with a
combination of 5-FU and chloroquine (red overlay) when
compared to scramble controls (blue overlay) (***p <
0.0001). Data from three independent experiments is
presented as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) to the right.
Analysis of cell morphology indicated extensive
accumulation of vesicles in the presence of both
chloroquine and a combination of 5-FU & chloroquine
in ISG15 depleted cells (Figure 3H lower left and right
panels, arrowheads). Collectively, these data suggest that
ISG15 siRNA is initiating autophagy rather than impeding
autophagosome turnover. Similar effects of ISG15 siRNA
on induced autophagy were observed with rapamycin and
valproic acid (Supplementary Figure 2).
An additional apoptosis competent esophageal
cancer cell line (FLO-1), expressing the ISGylation
pathway was also evaluated. Depletion of ISG15 was
confirmed by Western blot (Supplementary Figure 3A)
and resulted in elevated LC3 II in both untreated and
5-FU treated cells, when compared to scramble controls
(Supplementary Figure 3B). The Cyto-ID assay was used
to confirm that ISG15 siRNA is also initiating autophagy
in this cell line, with enhanced fluorescence observed
in ISG15 depleted cells treated with either chloroquine
alone [Supplementary Figure 3C (i)] (red overlay) (**p
= 0.0046) or combined with 5-FU [Supplementary
Figure 3C (ii)] (red overlay) (**p = 0.0038) relative to
scrambled controls (blue overlays). Depletion of ISG15
also enhanced the recovery of FLO-1 cells, relative to
scrambled controls (Supplementary Figure 3D).

ISG15 silencing with siRNA promotes
endogenous and induced autophagic flux
The enhanced recovery of cells with ISG15 siRNA
suggested that ISG15 expression may be impeding a
survival pathway. Therefore, the effect of ISG15 siRNA on
endogenous and induced autophagy was assessed. For all
autophagy assays, cells were treated with 5-FU (30 μM)
for 24 hr and then replenished with drug free media for
a further 24 hr. As shown in Figure 3A, analysis of LC3
II (an autophagosome marker) by Western blot revealed
a clear increase in LC3 II accumulation in untreated
cells with ISG15 siRNA alone when compared with
untransfected and scrambled controls. LC3 II induction by
5-FU was also further enhanced by ISG15 siRNA (Figure
3B middle lane).
The effect of ISG15 siRNA on autophagy was also
quantified using an additional assay, the Cyto-ID autophagy
detection kit, which specifically labels autophagosomes. As
shown in Figure 3C, ISG15 siRNA significantly increased
5-FU induced Cyto-ID fluorescence confirming enhanced
autophagosome accumulation (red overlay) beyond
scramble control (blue overlay) (**p = 0.0016). Data
from three independent experiments is presented as mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) to the right.
Analysis of cellular morphology showed vesicle
accumulation in cells treated with 5-FU (Figure 3D upper
right panel, arrowheads). When ISG15 is depleted by
siRNA, vesicle accumulation is further enhanced (Figure
3D lower left and right panels, arrowheads).
The entire autophagic process, from sequestration
to degradation is referred to as autophagic flux. LC3 II
accumulation may be a consequence of either increased
autophagy initiation or a block in autophagosome turnover.
Therefore, to differentiate between induction and vesicle
accumulation due to a failure in turnover, cells were
pre-treated with chloroquine to block lysosome function
and autophagosome turnover. Any LC3 II accumulation
beyond that observed with chloroquine alone is then
attributed to enhanced autophagy initiation [17].
The effect of ISG15 siRNA on flux was assessed
by 2 hr pre-treatment of cells with chloroquine (10
μM) followed by treatment with 5-FU for 24hr, which
was followed by an additional 24 hr recovery in drug
free medium. As shown in Figure 3E, treatment of
untransfected or scrambled control cells with chloroquine
alone showed LC3 II accumulation (when compared to
control levels in Figure 3A), which was further enhanced

UBE2L6 siRNA promotes endogenous autophagy
induction
Our data thus far has suggested that ISG15
can influence autophagy. If UBE2L6 is required for
conjugating ISG15 to substrate proteins, then UBE2L6
would be expected to influence autophagy in a similar
manner to ISG15.
To evaluate the contribution of UBE2L6 to
autophagy, gene expression was depleted by siRNA and loss
of UBE2L6 protein was confirmed by Western blot (Figure
4A). UBE2L6 siRNA alone [Figure 4B lane 2 (without
drug)] increased the level of LC3 II relative to controls
(lanes 1 and 3). Chloroquine treatment (10 μM) alone
increased LC3 II in scrambled and untransfected control
cells (lanes 4 and 6) and this is significantly enhanced by
UBE2L6 siRNA (lane 5), suggesting that UBE2L6 also
influences autophagy initiation rather than turnover.
The effect of UBE2L6 siRNA on autophagy was
also quantitated using the Cyto-ID assay. As shown in

UBE2L6 siRNA increases 5-FU induced autophagy,
similar to ISG15. Examination of morphology of 5-FU
treated cells showed enhanced vesicle formation in the

Cyto-ID was also used to quantitate autophagosome

increase in LC3 II above that observed with 5-FU alone
(see Figure 5A ), however the levels of LC3 II were
further increased in UBE2L6 depleted cells (Figure 5D).
Morphology also confirmed a further induction of vesicles
in UBE2L6 depleted cells, when compared to scrambled
control cells treated with a combination of chloroquine
and 5-FU (Figure 5E right panel, arrowheads). Flux
was also assessed using Cyto-ID staining. Chloroquine
(black overlay) or 5-FU alone (orange overlay) caused
an increase in fluorescence above untreated cells (grey
filled peak) (Figure 5F). The combination of chloroquine
and 5-FU (green overlay) resulted in autophagosome
accumulation in excess of either chloroquine or drug
alone, which was further enhanced by UBE2L6 siRNA
(red overlay) relative to scrambled controls (blue overlay)
(***p < 0.0001). Data from three independent experiments
is presented as MFI to the right. The effect of UBE2L6
siRNA on autophagy induction was also confirmed
using rapamycin (100 nM) in the presence or absence of
chloroquine (10 μM) (Supplementary Figure 4).
The effect of UBE2L6 was also evaluated in the
FLO-1 cell line. Silencing of UBE2L6 with siRNA was
confirmed by Western blot (Supplementary Figure 5A).
UBE2L6 siRNA alone increased the levels of LC3 II
relative to controls (Supplementary Figure 5B, lanes
1-3). 5-FU treatment increased LC3 II in scrambled and
untransfected cells (lanes 4 and 5) and this was enhanced
by UBE2L6 siRNA (lane 6), suggesting that UBE2L6
influences 5-FU-induced autophagy in this cell line. The
increase in LC3 II in UBE2L6 depleted cells treated with
a combination of 5-FU and chloroquine (Supplementary
Figure 5C, lane 6) suggests that UBE2L6 also influences
initiation rather than turnover in the FLO-1 cells.
The Cyto-ID assay also demonstrates a significant
difference in autophagosome accumulation in FLO-1 cells
with depleted UBE2L6 (orange overlay) when compared
to scrambled controls (green overlay) (Supplementary
Figure 5D) (**p = 0.0013). This elevation of autophagy
was also evident in response to 5-FU (Supplementary
Figure 5E) (**p = 0.0075) and again in cells treated with
a combination of 5-FU and chloroquine (Supplementary
Figure 5F) (***p < 0.0001)—indicating elevated
autophagic flux in both untreated and 5-FU treated FLO-1
cells (Supplementary Figure 5A-5F). Analysis of recovery
of FLO-1 cells following 5-FU treatment, found no
difference in UBE2L6 depleted cells relative to scrambled
controls (Supplementary Figure 5G).
These data collectively suggest that UBE2L6 can
negatively regulate the initiation of endogenous autophagy
and autophagy induced by a range of other cytotoxic
agents. This is consistent with the effect of ISG15 siRNA
and suggests that UBE2L6 may regulate autophagy
induction via the ISG15 pathway.
Induction of autophagy by ISG15 siRNA is associated
with enhanced recovery in both OE21 and FLO-1 cells. In
contrast, UBE2L6 depletion does not protect either cell line
from 5-FU—despite clear induction of autophagy. UBE2L6

may therefore have other substrates or targets that limit any
protective effects of the induced autophagy.

Evaluation of mRNA expression in tumours
We examined publicly available databases to look
for a potential biological significance of UBE2L6 or
ISG15 transcript expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) had sequence data—but limited expression data
for esophageal or gastric cancer. We then looked at a
gastric cancer database that has been assembled recently
from several sources and includes studies using the same
arrays that we used in our initial analysis of the esophageal
cell lines (HGU133) [18]. This combined database is
publicly available at:
http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&
cancer=gastric.
While this is not the same tissue type as our study, it
is a similar type of cancer in terms of origin and treatment.
Expression of UBE2L6 / UBCH8 (Affy ID201649_at) was
analysed in 876 patients. Patients were split according
to median expression and there was no restriction on
subtype. Kaplan Meier overall survival (OS) analysis is
presented in Supplementary Figure 6. Higher expression
of UBE2L6 was associated with better overall survival
(hazard ratio (HR) = 0.8, P= 0.02) (Supplementary Figure
6A). In our cell lines, this would be associated with
apoptosis competency and repression of autophagy. We do
not know if this is linked to outcome in patients. UBE2L6
expression can be up regulated by Type I interferons and
may also be an indication of immune cell activation.
ISG15 expression was also analysed and while a similar
trend was apparent, this did not achieve significance
(P=0.094) (Supplementary Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have identified ISG15 and UBE2L6
as negative regulators of autophagy in esophageal cancer
cells. This suggests that ISG15 may be a key ubiquitinlike modifier of autophagy and that its conjugation to
substrates is likely to involve the E2 activity of UBE2L6.
Ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like conjugation systems
are a well-known feature of autophagy regulation and
overall regulation of proteostasis. In contrast, modification
of proteins with ISG15 is less well understood and has
been largely associated with innate immune defence
mechanisms. However, recent studies have highlighted
a potential link to autophagy as two key regulators of
autophagy or mitophagy (Beclin 1 and Parkin) have now
been identified as targets of ISGylation.

Autophagy targets
Type I IFN has been reported to induce ISGylation
of Beclin 1 at several lysine residues [19]. This protects
BECN1 from ubiquitination at Lys63 and inhibits PI3KC

kinase activity. As this suppresses autophagy it would
be consistent with our data, which imply a negative
regulatory role for both UBE2L6 and ISG15 in autophagy.
These observations by Xu et al were dependent on
exogenous stimulation of the ISG15 pathway by Type
I interferon. This treatment will upregulate many new
proteins and any of these may be subject to ISGylation.
In our study, the ISG15 pathway was investigated under
conditions of endogenous upregulation. It is possible,
however, that overlapping pathways and targets are
involved in both models. Our study also provides the first
evidence for involvement of UBE2L6 whereas the Xu et al
study highlights the opposing role of USP18, as a positive
regulator of autophagy. Together these studies support a
key role for this pathway in autophagy regulation. Another
study has reported that the E3 ligase Parkin, an important
regulator of mitophagy, is also modified by ISGylation.
Parkin was shown to be modified when ISGylation
components were overexpressed or when cells are treated
with type I IFN, LPS or other selected drugs. ISGylation
at Lys-349 and Lys 369 was reported to enhance Parkins
E3 ligase activity [20].

cells lines suggesting that ISG15 expression in tumours
could be a factor affecting CPT sensitivity in these tumour
cells [28]. In our study we found that while depletion of
both IGS15 and UBE2L6 elevates autophagy, only those
esophageal cancer cells with ISG15 knockdown showed a
decrease in sensitivity to 5-FU, consistent with the effects
of ISG15 silencing reported by Desai et al. In contrast,
sensitivity of esophageal cells to 5-FU was unaffected by
UBE2L6 knockdown. While we do not know the reason
for this—it is clear from other studies that UBE2L6 can
also act as an E2 enzyme for ubiquitin. The ubiquitination
and stability of p21 has been reported to be mediated by
UBE2L6 or UBCH7 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase p53RFP
(p53-inducible RING-finger protein) [29]. The potential of
UBE2L6 to influence ubiquitination of targets in a given
cell type will therefore broaden its biological activity and
may influence its overall effect on survival.

Potential targets in cancer cells?
Interferons are pleiotropic cytokines that interfere
with viral replication. They induce transcription of
more than 2000 interferon stimulated genes which
predominantly serve to activate the immune system. A
number of groups have now identified Type I interferons
as autophagy inducers [30]. In recent years, it has emerged
that autophagy plays a crucial role in the clearance of
bacterial and viral pathogens (reviewed in [31–33]).
Many studies have also implicated UBE2L6 and ISG15
as critical components of the innate immune response to
pathogen infection [34–36]. However, if expression of
the ISG15 pathway was directly required for autophagy
induction, we would have expected silencing of either
UBE2L6 or ISG15 to inhibit autophagy in our cells rather
than inducing it. Indeed, a recent study looking at enforced
overexpression of ISG15, or Type I IFN stimulation,
has reported that ISG15 interacts with HDAC6 and
p62 which facilitates aggresome formation and thereby
promotes autophagy [37]. As ISG15 has a preference
for newly synthesised proteins [38], this may be a way
of eliminating viral proteins which are produced in vast
excess following infection, as they could potentially be
cleared by ISGylation, aggregation and autophagy.
Here, with endogenous expression in esophageal
cancer cells, we report the opposite effect; knockdown of
ISG15 or UBE2L6 promotes autophagy. It is important
to consider that interferon signalling results in elevated
expression of a vast number of genes, any of which may
be the primary inducers of autophagy during infection. It
is possible that the ISG15 pathway can perform a negative
regulatory role to prevent over activation of autophagy.
This sort of negative feedback loop is a common feature
in immune regulation. It is also possible that endogenous
ISGylation (as in these tumour cells) may have a different
function in tumour cells—and distinct targets—compared
to interferon-induced ISGylation. It is notable that, many
of the targets identified by mass spectrometry in IFN

UBE2L6, ISG15 and cancer
Aberrant expression of UBE2L6 or other members
of the ISGylation system have been reported in various
cancers [21]. Significant upregulation of UBE2L6 was
reported in prostate cancer and esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma when compared to corresponding nonmalignant tissues [22, 23]. ISG15 expression was also
associated with differentiation grade and metastasis
in Hepatocellular carcinoma [24] and had prognostic
value in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients,
particularly those who consume alcohol [25]. In
nasopharyngeal cancer, high ISG15 correlated with
frequent local cancer recurrence and shorter overall
survival [26]. In pancreatic cancer, ISG15 was secreted
by tumour associated macrophages and promoted cancer
stem cell renewal and invasiveness [27]. We interrogated
a publically available database to see if we could identify
a relationship between expression of UBE2L6 or ISG15
and overall survival in gastric cancer. Expression of
UBE2L6 was significantly associated with better survival
in this cohort. It would be useful to conduct further
IHC analysis on patient tissue to establish whether this
expression is primarily in the tumour tissue or also in
stromal or immune infiltrating cells.

ISGylation and therapeutic response
A previous study evaluated the effects of silencing
either ISG15 or UBE2L6 on drug sensitivity in breast
cancer cells. They reported a significant decrease in
sensitivity to camptothecin (CPT) when either ISG15 or
UBE2L6 were silenced. They also observed a reduction in
the levels of ISG15 in a number of drug resistant cancer

treated cells, were also constitutively expressed and
involved in processes such as stress response, metabolism,
chromatin remodelling or RNA processing [12].
We currently do not know the mechanism by which
the ISGylation pathway may be regulating autophagy and
it is possible that several targets are involved. Combined
proteomic studies have identified at least 300 proteins that
are targeted by ISGylation [12, 14, 39], although only a
fraction have been experimentally validated as substrates,
with known effects of ISGylation [40]. ISGylation may
modulate stability, activity or interaction with other
proteins. It has been suggested that ISGylation could
increase the stability of substrates as it opposes polyubiquitination [41]. Silencing of UBE2L6 or ISG15 by
siRNA may therefore lead to increased poly-ubiquitination
and degradation of a negative regulator(s) of autophagy.
Further studies must be carried out to identify the
substrates and primary mechanisms involved in autophagy
regulation.
In conclusion, this data has shown that the ISG15
pathway may play a role in chemosensitivity by regulating
autophagy and survival. It is notable that this pathway is
not critical to normal cells and is apparently only required
under certain conditions, such as during an innate immune
response. As such, it provides a relatively tumour specific
targeting opportunity. Clearly, further molecular studies
are required so that strategic targeting can be achieved and
drug resistance eliminated in esophageal cancer.

reagent (Life Technologies 11668500), according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blotting and antibodies
Total cellular protein extracts were prepared by
trypsinization of cells and lysing in modified RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 % sodium
deoxycholate, 1 % Igepal, 1 mM EDTA, 1x Pefabloc, 1x
protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF). All
protein samples (30 or 45 μg) were separated on NuPAGE
4–12 % Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen Life Technologies
NP0322) and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF
membrane using the iBlot gel transfer system (Invitrogen
IB1001). Membranes were incubated with anti-LC3 (MBL
PD014), anti-UBEL26 (Abcam AP2118a) or anti-ISG15
(CST 2743S) antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with antiβ-actin (loading control) (Sigma A5441) for one hour at
room temperature. Proteins were visualized using relevant
IR-Dye conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland) on the
Odyssey IR imaging system (Li-Cor, Cambridge, United
Kingdom). For all Western blots, integrated intensities are
representative of three independent experiments.

Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit
Trypsinized cells were stained with the CytoID autophagy detection kit (Enzo Life Sciences ENZ51031-K200) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
An increase in the number of autophagic vesicles is
detected as an increase in fluorescence in the 488-2
channel. Data was collected on the BD LSR II flow
cytometer with BD FACS Diva acquisition software.
Gating and overlay histograms were generated using
Flowjo data analysis software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Established human esophageal cancer cell
lines OE19, OE21 and OE33 were obtained from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures. KYSE450 and
FLO-1 cells were from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH). OE19,
OE21, OE33 and FLO-1 cell lines were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma R8758) and KYSE450
cells were maintained in 50:50 RPMI 1640:F-12 HAMS
medium (Sigma N6658). All cultures were supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies
15070-063), 10 % (v/v) foetal calf serum (Sigma F7524)
and maintained at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. All reagents were
purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Drugs used
include rapamycin R8781, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) F6627
and valproic acid P4543.

Evaluation of morphology
Cells were cytospun and stained using pro-diff I and
II (Braidwood Laboratories BAPROD1). Apoptotic cells
were characterised based on the appearance of two or
more of the following features: cell shrinkage, chromatin
condensation, DNA degradation and fragmentation into
‘apoptotic bodies’ within an intact plasma membrane.
Cytospin images are representative of at least three
independent experiments. Images were captured using
a DP70 digital microscope camera and Olympus DPSoft823 version 3.2 software (Mason Technologies
Dublin, Ireland).

siRNA transfection

Colony formation assay

Cells were reverse transfected with 20 nM gene
specific siRNAs and non-specific scrambled controls
(Dharmacon ISG15: L-004235-03-0005, UBE2L6:
L-008569-00-0005, Non-targeting siRNA #1: D-00181001-20), using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection

Colony formation (clonogenic) assays were used
to determine the ability of cells to recover from a drug
treatment and re-establish colonies as a monolayer. Cells
were transfected or treated and following drug removal,
the cells were trypsinized and viable cells counted. 1,500

viable cells were reseeded into a well of a six-well plate
(in triplicate). Cells were allowed to attach and grow for
between 10 and 14 days. Following the recovery period,
media was removed and following a PBS wash, cells
were fixed in 96 % ethanol for 5 minutes and stained with
Prodiff II (Braidwood Laboratories E310). Plates were
scanned and quantified using the Odyssey IR imaging
system (Li-Cor, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Results are
presented as integrated intensity ± SEM (standard error
