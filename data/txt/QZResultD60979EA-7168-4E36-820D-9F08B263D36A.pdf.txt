ABSTRACT
Although lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels, indirect markers of
angiogenesis, are associated with a worse outcome in several tumours, their
prognostic value is not defined in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, high levels are
associated even with a lack of efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, contributing to
explain negative results in clinical trials. We assessed the role of LDH in advanced
pancreatic cancer receiving sorafenib.
Seventy-one of 114 patients included in the randomised phase II trial MAPS
(chemotherapy plus or not sorafenib) and with available serum LDH levels, were
included in this analysis. Patients were categorized according to serum LDH levels
(LDH ≤vs.> upper normal rate).
A significant difference was found in progression free survival (PFS) and in
overall survival (OS) between patients with LDH values under or above the cut-off
(PFS: 5.2 vs. 2.7 months, p = 0.0287; OS: 10.7 vs. 5.9 months, p = 0.0021).
After stratification according to LDH serum levels and sorafenib treatment,
patients with low LDH serum levels treated with sorafenib showed an advantage in
PFS (p = 0.05) and OS (p = 0.0012).
LDH appears to be a reliable parameter to assess the prognosis of advanced
pancreatic cancer patients, and it may be a predictive parameter to select patients
candidate to receive sorafenib.

INTRODUCTION

(PFS) (Figure 1a) and overall survival (OS) (Figure 1b)
(Table 1).
Furthermore, in preclinical studies, high levels
of LDH were reported to predict resistance to several
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including sorafenib [10].
Based on these findings, after the encouraging results
of our retrospective assessment, we decided to investigate
the role of LDH in the phase II randomized trial (MAPS
trial) assessing the role of Sorafenib, an anti-angiogenetic
multitarget TKI, in combination with gemcitabine vs.
gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma
in order to find out a possible prognostic and predictive
effect of LDH serum levels in this setting [11].

A growing body of evidence indicates that hypoxia
may promote cancer development and it is involved in the
resistance to treatment of cancer cells via the formation of
new blood vessels.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is a key enzyme
in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic
conditions [1, 2]. The biological link between hypoxia,
LDH levels and the tumor-driven angiogenesis pathway
through the abnormal activation of the hypoxia inducible
factor 1 (HIF-1) is well established. The biological activity
of HIF-1 is determined by the expression and activity
of the HIF-1α subunit [3]. HIF-1α is an essential factor
that up-regulates a series of genes involved in glycolytic
energy metabolism, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis and cell
survival [4]. Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment is
sufficient to activate HIF-dependent expression of several
down-regulated genes [5]. These include genes encoding
for vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin and
many enzymes involved in glucose, iron, and nucleotide
metabolism [6].
The role of hypoxia and how LDH may be useful
to identify “hypoxic” tumours has been investigated by
our group in colorectal carcinoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma [7–9].
Recently, extending our analysis of LDH expression
in pancreatic cancer patients, we have retrospectively
evaluated the role of this serum marker in a common
practice population of 132 advanced pancreatic
cancer patients receiving a first line chemotherapy at
our institution from 2008 to 2012. Results from this
exploratory analysis have shown that LDH serum levels
over the upper normal rate (UNR) were associated
with poor prognosis in terms progression free survival

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients selection
All patients included in the “MAPS” phase
randomized II trial with known LDH values were eligible
for our analysis.
For all patients LDH values were collected within
one month before the start of chemotherapy. We divided
patients according to serum LDH levels in two groups:
A: LDH ≤ upper normal rate (UNR) and B: LDH > UNR).
LDH serum levels were determined according to
IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
and Laboratory Medicine) method. The assay has been
conducted in Institution Laboratories certified for Quality
control according to the present rules in Europe.
The follow-up and evaluation of treatment response
protocols, applied in the MAPS phase two study, are
summarized below.
Evaluations before and during treatment consisted
of a complete medical history and physical examination;

cancer patients receiving a first line chemotherapy at our Institution from 2008 to 2012 were analysed. LDH ≤ UNR (99 patients) vs.
LDH > UNR (33 patients): PFS 4.3 vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.0105; OS 8.6 vs. 3.9 months, p = 0.0042.

The two patients groups proved homogeneous for all
the clinical assessed variables (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In last few years, cytotoxic and “biological”
agents have resulted in no meaningful improvements
in pancreatic cancer patients’ outcome[12, 13]. Several
phase III studies assessing the role of targeted therapies,
such as cetuximab [14], bevacizumab [15], erlotinib [16],
aflibercept [17], and sorafenib [18], failed to show any
significant benefit. One of the reasons of these negative
results is the lack of patient selection.
Data from several analyses on different cancers
seem to suggest that LDH levels may be a significant
prognostic factor.
In colorectal cancer patients, LDH up-regulation
was in fact associated with an increased risk of nodal
and distant metastases and high LDH serum levels have
been shown to correlate with a decreased median overall
survival [19, 20].
A strong association between the expression of LDH
and an aggressive phenotype has also been demonstrated
in gastric cancer [21] and in hepatocellular carcinoma
[7, 8, 22].
This apparently enhanced tumor aggressiveness,
often determining a worse prognosis in cancer patients
whit high LDH levels, have been correlated with
molecular mechanisms underlying tumor hypoxia and
angiogenesis. This possible link, LDH levels and tumor
angiogenesis, has been analyzed in 2 different clinical
trials (the CONFIRM 1 & 2 trials) investigating PTK/ZK
(vatalanib), an oral VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor) inhibitor in advanced colorectal cancer.
Both these trials seemed to suggest that angiogenesis

RESULTS
LDH values were available in 71 out of the
114 MAPS trial enrolled patients. Low LDH serum
levels were present in 58 patients while 13 presented high
LDH values.
A statistically significant difference was found
in PFS (Figure 2a) and in OS (Figure 2b) between
patients with LDH values under (58 patients, 82%), or
above (13 patients, 18%) the cut-off (group A vs. group
B: mPFS 5.2 vs. 2.7 months, HR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.24–1.11,
p = 0.0287; mOS 10.7 vs 5.9 months, HR: 0.36, 95%CI:
0.13–0.98, p = 0.0021).
Stratifying the study population according to LDH
serum levels and treatment (chemotherapy plus sorafenib
or chemotherapy alone), patients with low LDH serum
levels receiving sorafenib showed an advantage in PFS
(Figure 3a; sorafenib and LDH ≤ UNR: 31 patients, 44%,
7.6 months; sorafenib and LDH > UNR: 6 patients, 8%,
2.8 months; no sorafenib and LDH ≤ UNR: 27 patients,
38%, 3.3 months; no sorafenib and LDH > UNR:

p
inhibitors are more effective in patients with high serum
LDH levels, confirming the association between this
serum marker and tumor angiogenesis [23, 24].
This evidence was confirmed in our work assessing
the role of pre-treatment LDH serum levels in colorectal
cancer patients receiving a first-line chemotherapy combined
with bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody.
Bevacizumab showed an advantage in the subgroup
of patients with high LDH levels and poor prognosis,
confirming the predictive role of LDH in this setting [9].
However, it could be quite different using a TKI
inhibitor, such as sorafenib. In fact we recently reported
how high LDH serum levels in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma treated with sorafenib are associated with
a worse outcome [8].
Based on these considerations, we reanalyzed
our MAPS trial in order to evaluate the predictive and
prognostic role of LDH serum levels. This analysis confirms
the prognostic role of LDH serum levels. Of note, we were
also able to show an advantage in PFS and OS in favour of
sorafenib in low LDH serum levels, supporting a potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

predictive value of LDH even for sorafenib. This clinical
findings are supported by a preclinical model, where it has
been demonstrated that the inhibition of LDH production
with oxamic acid in cancer cell lines potentiated the
antiproliferative activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such
as sorafenib [10]. The effect of high LDH levels on TKI low
activity may be explained by a competition between ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) and TKIs inhibition at the ATP
enzymatic site on the protein kinases target of their activity.
LDH catalyzed the final step in the glycolytic
pathway, the conversion of pyruvate and NADH to lactate
and NAD+, determining the maintenance of glycolytic
flow, and consequently, the production of ATP. In cancer
cells, in hypoxic condition, in which anaerobic glycolysis
is the main metabolic pathway to meet the energy request,
the inhibition of LDH could interfere whit this process,
causing the depletion of ATP and therefore a lower
competition against TKIs inhibitors.
These preclinical findings support our hypothesis
about the clinical role of LDH serum levels and are able
to contribute to explain the negative results in our MAPS

trial. Of interest could be a matching analysis of the results
of BAYPAN phase III study [18].
The French authors in a similar trial with
a comparable number of patients found a negative impact
of sorafenib. Reanalyzing this trial according to LDH
serum levels could open new perspectives for the use of
sorafenib in pancreatic cancer patients.
Likewise data from a reanalysis of the
CALGB-80303 phase III trial with bevacizumab could
be interesting [15]. In this case we could observe that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bevacizumab would be useful in patients with high
LDH levels.
Probably, by assaying a single parameter such as
LDH serum levels we could candidate patients to receive
the best anti-angiogenetic treatment.
Although our study was not preplanned in the design
of the MAPS trial and is conducted on a portion of the
original cohort of patients, results are promising. Larger
perspective studies focusing on LDH role are needed to
confirm our findings.
