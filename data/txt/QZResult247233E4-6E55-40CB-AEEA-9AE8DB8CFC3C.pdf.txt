ABSTRACT
Introduction: Mutations (MT) of the KRAS gene are the most common mutation
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), seen in about 20–25% of all adenocarcinomas.
Effect of KRAS MT on response to cytotoxic chemotherapy is unclear.
Methods: We undertook a single-institution retrospective analysis of 93
consecutive patients with stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma with known KRAS and EGFR
MT status to determine the association of KRAS MT with survival. All patients were
treated between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 with standard platinum based
chemotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania. Overall and progression free survival
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods.
Results: All patients in this series received platinum doublet chemotherapy, and
42 (45%) received bevacizumab. Overall survival and progression free survival for
patients with KRAS MT was no worse than for patients with wild type KRAS. Median
overall survival for patients with KRAS MT was 19 months (mo) vs. 15.6 mo for KRAS
WT, p = 0.34, and progression-free survival was 6.2 mo in patients with KRAS MT
vs. 7mo in patients with KRAS WT, p = 0.51. In multivariable analysis including age,
race, gender, and ECOG PS, KRAS MT was not associated with overall survival (HR
1.12, 95% CI 0.58–2.16, p = 0.74) or progression free survival (HR 0.80, 95% CI
0.48–1.34, p = 41). Of note, receipt of bevacizumab was associated with improved
overall survival only in KRAS WT patients (HR 0.34, p = 0.01).
Conclusions: KRAS MT are not associated with inferior progression-free and
overall survival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with standard first-line platinumbased chemotherapy.

in KRAS, usually point mutations in codon 12 or 13.
KRAS is a member of the RAS family of oncogenes
that encode small GTPases involved in cellular signal
transduction. KRAS mutations (MT) are more common
in adenocarcinoma than in other NSCLC histologies [5].
KRAS MT occur more often in smokers than nonsmokers
[6–9] unlike EGFR mutations and ALK translocations.
Targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), for EGFR and EML-4ALK mutations have

INTRODUCTION
Our understanding of the biology of NSCLC
has accelerated dramatically with the recognition that
oncogenic driver mutations often play a decisive role
in prognosis and treatment response. The introduction
of molecular markers is transforming the treatment
paradigms for this disease [1–4]. One of the most
common molecular changes in NSCLC is mutations

improved progression-free survival in patients bearing
the relevant mutations [1–3]. Despite initial forays [10]
into targeted therapy for KRAS MT NSCLC, there are no
such approved agents at this time.
Much of the existing literature suggests that NSCLC
patients with KRAS MT have inferior outcomes compared
to those with KRAS WT [7, 11–13]. This literature has
a number of serious limitations, however, including
small sample sizes and patient heterogeneity. A number
of studies have analyzed patient series comprising
a mix of patients with different NSCLC histologies
(adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and
stages [7, 11, 13–18].
The predictive value of KRAS mutations in
NSCLC for therapy selection also remains unclear [19,
20]. Various reports have suggested that treatment with
TKIs such as erlotinib results in inferior outcomes in
patients with KRAS MT NSCLC, [12, 21] but this view
is not universal [22]. While KRAS MT status is clearly
associated with lack of response to the anti-EGFR
antibody cetuximab in colorectal cancer, [23] in lung
adenocarcinoma KRAS MT status does not appear to
predict response to this agent [24].
Similarly, there are reports suggesting an adverse
effect of chemotherapy in patients with KRAS MT
compared to KRAS WT [20]. For the most part the series
are small and cover diverse therapeutic settings (adjuvant
therapy [14] and therapy of stage IV disease) and some of
the older studies used older chemotherapy regimens such
as cisplatin and vinorelbine.
In the absence of targeted therapies, and personalized
approaches, platinum doublet chemotherapy (with or
without bevacizumab) remains the current standard of
care for these patients. Given persistent uncertainty about
the predictive value of KRAS MT status in NSCLC,
we performed a retrospective, single-institution study
to determine the relationship between KRAS MT and
survival after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients
with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma.

more common in current or previous smokers compared
to lifelong nonsmokers (47% vs 16% p = 0.01).

Treatment
All subjects received first-line platinum doublet
chemotherapy; 96% received carboplatin and the remainder
cisplatin. A majority of patients (78%) received pemetrexed
as the platinum partner; 15 patients (16%) received either
paclitaxel or docetaxel (Table 1). Nearly half (45%) the
subjects received bevacizumab in addition to the platinum
doublet. Patients with KRAS MT were as likely as patients
without KRAS MT to receive pemetrexed or bevacizumab
based chemotherapies (Table 1).

Effect of KRAS on overall survival and
progression-free survival
Among 47 patients who were still alive at the close
of the study, median length of follow-up was 30 months
(range 2–51 months). There were 46 (49%) deaths during
the study period, with a median OS for all patients of
19.0 months (95%CI, 14.–28.9 months). There was no
significant difference in OS between patients with KRAS
WT and KRAS MT (median OS 19 months vs. 15.6
months, p = 0.34; Figure 1A). There were a total of 81
(90%) patients with progression during the study period,
with a median PFS for all subjects of 6.9 months (95%CI,
4.9 to 9.3 months). There was no significant difference
in PFS between patients with KRAS WT and KRAS MT
(median PFS 6.2 mo vs. 7.0 mo; p = 0.51; Figure 1B).
Sex, age, and tobacco history were not associated
with overall survival or PFS in univariate analyses
(Table 3 for OS, data for PFS not shown). There was,
however, significantly longer OS among patients with an
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 compared to patients
with a performance status of 2 (median OS 28.9 months
vs. 14.2 months; p = 0.01). In multivariable analysis
controlling for age, race, gender, and ECOG PS, there
was no significant difference in OS (HR 1.12, 95% CI
0.58–2.16, p = 0.74) or PFS (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.48–1.34,
p = 41) between patients with KRAS MT and those with
KRAS WT.

Median age was 60 years; 51% were women and
20% were lifelong nonsmokers. Baseline characteristics
were similar in both groups (Table 1). Thirty-eight (40%)
patients had KRAS MT (See Table 2). Of the 55 KRAS
wild type (WT) subjects, 5 (5%) had EGFR MT, and
50 (53%) were EGFR WT. Most patients had an ECOG
performance status of 0 or 1 (34% and 49%, respectively).
The majority of KRAS MT were codon 12 mutations with
2 codon 13 mutations and 1 not specified. Gly12Cys was
the most common amino acid substitution (15 patients),
followed by Gly12Val (11 patients). KRAS MTs were

Nearly half (45%) of the subjects received
bevacizumab. We evaluated the effect of bevacizumab
therapy to determine whether outcomes varied by KRAS
mutation status. Among KRAS WT patients, the use of
bevacizumab in addition to platinum doublet therapy
resulted in significant improvements in OS (median 28.9
mo vs. 14.2 mo; p = 0.01) and PFS (median 9.5 mo vs. 4.8
mo, p = 0.004). This effect remained significant for KRAS

in a relatively uniform population of patients with stage IV
adenocarcinoma receiving platinum doublet chemotherapy.
In addition, we found that bevacizumab use was associated
with significantly better outcome in the KRAS WT
population, but not in those with KRAS MTs. A similar
effect was observed in a study of neoadjuvant bevacizumab,
where 10 patients with KRAS MT NSCLC who underwent
resection did not have a major pathological response [27].
KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in
patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and many studies have
been conducted to evaluate its clinical and therapeutic
implications. Despite the successes with targeted therapy
for driver mutations, personalized therapy for patients
with KRAS MT is still under development. Platinum
doublet chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, is
the standard of care.

DISCUSSION
We studied a consecutive series of patients with
stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma and known EGFR and
KRAS mutation status. In our population, KRAS MTs were
common, similar to what has been observed in other series.
As expected, KRAS MTs were more frequent in smokers
and were nearly all codon 12 mutations. Our key finding
is that KRAS MTs were not associated with OS or PFS
when controlling for age, smoking status, and ECOG PS

KRAS

The predictive role of KRAS is controversial,
with prior studies of KRAS MT in lung adenocarcinoma
yielding contradictory conclusions. In the adjuvant
setting, the relationship of KRAS MT to chemotherapy
was explored in a molecular analysis of the patients
included in the JBR.10 clinical trial. In this analysis,
KRAS MT were neither prognostic of survival nor
predictive of a differential benefit from adjuvant cisplatin
and vinorelbine [15]. Shepherd et al reached similar
conclusions in their exploratory analyses characterizing
relationships between KRAS MT and survival outcomes
across three adjuvant trials from the LACE BIO metaanalysis. They analyzed 300 patients with KRAS MT
(predominantly codon 12 mutations). For the patients that
received adjuvant chemotherapy, no significant benefit
was observed for KRAS WT or patients with codon-12
KRAS MT. However, for patients with codon 13 KRAS
MT, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a worse
survival. Since the number of patients with codon 13 MT
was small, the authors concluded that KRAS status could
not be recommended to select patients with NSCLC for
adjuvant chemotherapy [14].
Furthermore, retrospective studies in the metastatic
setting have shown mixed chemotherapy effect based on
the presence or absence of a KRAS MT [28, 29]. Sun et
al [20] reported a worse response rate and PFS for the
pemetrexed-based regimen in KRAS MT compared to
KRAS WT subjects; KRAS MT were also associated with
inferior outcomes after gemcitabine-based chemotherapy,
but there was no difference in KRAS MT and WT patients
receiving a taxane-based regimen.

In contrast to the previous studies, we did not
find a worse survival outcome for patients with KRAS
MT. Majority of our patients had codon 12 MT, and
were treated with a pemetrexed based regimen, making
comparisons between different chemotherapy regimens
difficult. Our study adds to the above literature by
exploring the relationship of KRAS MT to survival in
patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma. The strength
of our investigation is our relatively homogenous pt
population: all patients had stage IV adenocarcinoma,
the percentage of KRAS MT is similar to that reported
in the literature, all patients received platinum based
doublet chemotherapy in 1st line and a majority of
patients received a contemporary regimen of carboplatin
and pemetrexed. In addition, a significant proportion of
the patients received bevacizumab, making this the largest
study to explore the relationship of bevacizumab and
KRAS MT.
Our study also has several important limitations:
first, it is a retrospective study, and inclusion was
limited to patients that had been tested for EGFR and
KRAS MT. Second, although our study population is
large compared to most of the existing literature it is
nevertheless relatively small. Third, progression events
were determined based on the assessment of the treating
oncologist abstracted from the medical record and not
by the formal RECIST metrics that might be used in
a clinical trial. Fourth, our analysis mainly describes
the prognostic role of KRAS codon 12 mutations and
provides no insight into the role of KRAS MT codon
13 mutations. Finally, since our patients received a
30291

Mutational analysis

nearly homogenous treatment regimen, we are unable to
analyze the effects of different chemotherapy regimens
on outcome in patients with KRAS MT compared to
KRAS WT NSCLC. However, the high percentage of
patients receiving pemetrexed in our study is a notable
difference from prior studies [12, 20] which for the
most part noted inferior survival for KRAS MT patients
receiving systemic chemotherapy with pemetrexed [20].
Based on our observations, it is possible that pemetrexed
may have a more favorable effect on KRAS MT tumors
than, but our study was not designed to answer this
question in a formal manner.
Our study suggests that KRAS MT is not
associated with worse PFS and OS in advanced NSCLC
patients treated with platinum doublet chemotherapy.
Our study suggests that patients with KRAS WT may
benefit more from bevacizumab compared to patients
with KRAS MT. Due to the small sample size of our
patient population, this observation is purely hypothesis
generating, and needs further analysis. Our results are
not generalizable to earlier-stage or non-adenocarcinoma
NSCLC. Based on our observations, patients with Stage
IV KRAS MT NSCLC should be treated with similar
chemotherapy regimens as KRAS WT patients, including
the use of bevacizumab when clinically appropriate.
Furthermore, the differential effects of codon 12 and
codon 13 KRAS MT should also be analyzed in a larger
population; utilizing next generation sequencing in
the future would be helpful to explore relationship of
different genetic subgroups to overall outcome. In the
future, the real utility of KRAS testing will depend on
the availability of KRAS directed therapeutics, which
has been elusive to date.

Patients were included only if a written report of
the mutational analysis could be verified. EGFR and
KRAS immunohistochemistry or amplification was not
considered. Only EGFR mutations known to be correlated
with prognosis (i.e., exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R)
were considered in our analysis. All KRAS and EGFR
mutation testing was done with quantitative polymerase
chain reaction. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor
specimens. KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were
assessed by direct sequencing of exon 2 using primers for
the seven most common point mutations (nucleotides c.34G,
c.35G and c.38G) (NM_004985.3). EGFR mutations were
assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods
that detect exon 19 deletions and exon 21 leucine-to-arginine
codon 858 (L858R) amino acid substitutions [26].

Clinical data
The following information was collected from the
electronic medical record: age at diagnosis, sex, race,
ethnicity, smoking status, ECOG performance status at
diagnosis; stage at diagnosis (TNM, according to AJCC
7th edition guidelines), histology, method of diagnosis,
date of diagnosis; treatment (first, second and third line
therapies) and its outcome (response, progression, stable
disease), EGFR and KRAS mutation status and whether
EML4-ALK mutation testing was performed.

Statistical analysis
Progression-free-survival (PFS) was calculated
from date of diagnosis to date of death or progression;
the date of progression was based on documentation
by the treating oncologist in the electronic medical
record. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from date
of diagnosis to date of death or date of last followup. Patients were censored at 5/31/2012 or last follow
up visit if they were subsequently lost to follow-up
prior to the end of data collection. Chi-square analysis
was used to describe the relationship of KRAS MT to
smoking status (never vs. current or former smoker).
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate overall
and progression-free survival. Cox proportional hazard
models were used to determine the relationship of
KRAS MT to survival, with adjustment for ECOG PS,
gender, race, and age. To assess the proportional hazards
assumption, we used the Schoenfeld residuals test and
complementary log-log plots.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population
Consecutive patients diagnosed with Stage IV
NSCLC seen at the University of Pennsylvania’s
Abramson Cancer Center between January 1, 2008
and December 31, 2011 were analyzed retrospectively.
Patients with histology other than adenocarcinoma or
adenosquamous cancer and patients with stages other
than AJCC 7th edition [25] stage IV at presentation
were excluded. Patients who did not receive treatment
(i.e., were seen only once in consultation) were also
excluded, as were those who received no chemotherapy
(for example, radiation only) or who received first-line
erlotinib. Only patients with known KRAS and EGFR
MT status were included. Absence of known EML4ALK status was permitted given the era in which the
study was conducted. Ninety-three patients were
included in the final analysis. This study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Pennsylvania.
