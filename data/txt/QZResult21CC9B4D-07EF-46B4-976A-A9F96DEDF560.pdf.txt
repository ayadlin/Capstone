Significant progress in understanding the mechanisms leading to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has led to the identification of numerous
molecular abnormalities that may be responsible for leukemogenesis. Over the
same period, large trials have established standard regimens combining cytotoxic
agents for the treatment of patients with AML. Current research is attempting to

he traditional chemotherapy regimens used to treat adults with
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not changed significantly.
Large randomized trials failed to demonstrate the superiority of
adding new cytotoxic agents to the traditional cytarabine and
anthracycline-based regimens. With the exception of high-dose
cytarabine in younger patients with favorable cytogenetics, variations in the dose have not improved survival. Understanding the
molecular events of leukemogenesis has led to the identification of
molecular alterations with prognostic significance, which may also
be targets for therapeutic intervention. This has already led to
improvements in outcome in patients with specific subsets such as
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Agents with significant in vitro
activity targeted at leukemia-specific aberrations have been investigated in early clinical trials with promising activity. Herein we
review the progress in the therapy of AML.

Risk Stratification in Adult AML
Predictors of response and survival in AML include: 1) patientrelated factors such as age, performance status, and organ function;
2) disease-related factors recognizing the inherent resistance of
some subsets of AML to existing therapies; and 3) treatment-related
factors (recognizing that identification of highly effective therapies
can overcome the other 2 determinants).
Previous studies have identified a number of consistent prognostic factors. These include age, karyotype, performance status,
organ dysfunction, white blood cell count at presentation, antecedent hematologic disorders, and molecular abnormalities (eg, MDR,
FLT-3 ITD, C/EBPa, BAALC, NPM). Age is an important determinant
of outcome in AML, with investigators defining age cutoffs of 60 or
65 years beyond which the outcome is worse. Poor prognosis in
older patients is a result of an intrinsically more resistant disease

(higher incidence of poor-risk cytogenetics, MDR,
and other as-yet undefined risk factors), and limited
tolerability of traditional cytotoxic agents. In a study
of 998 patients aged 65 years or older with AML
or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we
identified predictive factors for complete remission
(CR), 8-week mortality, and overall survival (OS).1
In all 3 categories, patients aged 75 years or older
fared worse than younger patients. Other studies
have confirmed the influence of age on outcome of
AML.2

Risk Stratification by Cytogenetics
The prognostic effect of karyotype is well established
(Table 1). A Medical Research Council (MRC) study
in 1612 patients confirmed the importance of cytogenetics in risk stratification for AML.3 Patients in this
study were younger (age <55 years) and received
uniform treatment. They could be divided into 3
cytogenetic categories: favorable, intermediate, and
unfavorable karyotypes. Patients with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities had 5-year survival rates of 10%
to 21%. Patients with structural (eg, del[9q],
abn[11q23], del[7q]) or numeric (eg, 18, 121, 122)
cytogenetic abnormalities (as well as diploid cytogenetics) had 5-year survival rates ranging from 23% to
60% and were identified as having intermediate risk
disease. Patients with favorable abnormalities,
including t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17), had 5-year
survival rates of 60% to 70%. The presence of secondary abnormalities did not influence outcome.4 In
a follow-up study including an older population
(ages 44–91 years), all subgroups had worse outcomes, further emphasizing the importance of age4
(Table 1).
The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)
determined the prognostic impact of cytogenetic
abnormalities on CR rate, 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR), and 5-year survival.5 In

1901

this study of 1213 patients with AML, aged 15 to 86
years, the characteristics of the 3 identified subgroups were slightly different from the MRC study.
They defined complex as the presence of more than
3 abnormalities and identified del(9q), as favorable
for survival but intermediate for CR and CIR. In addition, among translocations involving 11q23, t(6;11),
and t(11;19) were unfavorable for survival, whereas
t(9;11) was intermediate. The 3 categories had different expectations for 5-year survival (Table 1). In a
more recent study, the CALGB investigators further
confirmed the importance of pretreatment cytogenetics in predicting outcome in patients aged 60
years and older.6 The Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) studied 609 adults with AML (ages 16–55
years) who were treated with allogeneic transplantation if a donor was available and identified cytogenetic risk groups similar to those observed in the
previous studies (Table 1).7
Cytogenetic risk assessment has led to specific
treatment strategies. Patients with APL may be treated effectively with ATRA and arsenic trioxide.8–10
Patients with favorable-risk AML other than APL are
highly sensitive to cytarabine, and multiple courses
of high-dose cytarabine (range, 3–4 courses) significantly improved their survival.11

Molecular Abnormalities as Predictors of Outcome
Normal or diploid karyotype constitutes the largest
single cytogenetic group in AML.11 Intermediatedose or high-dose cytarabine improved outcome in
younger patients (age 60 years) with diploid karyotype.12 The need to define risk factors within cytogenetic subgroups (particularly with diploid AML) has
led to the identification of several prognostic molecular abnormalities (Table 2).13 The role of these molecular subgroups in identifying subsets within the
favorable and poor-risk cytogenetic categories is less
clear.
The FMS-like tyrosine kinase (TK) 3, or FLT-3 is
a member of class 3 TK receptors. FLT-3 protein is
expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors and
plays a major role in myeloid differentiation.17 An
important mutation in FLT3 is the internal tandem
duplication (ITD), which results in constitutive activation of the TK activity of FLT-3, leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways mediating
survival and proliferation.17 Another mutation, occurring in 7% of patients, is the TK domain point mutation in codon 835. FLT3 ITD mutations occur in 20%
to 30% of patients with AML and are common in
patients with diploid cytogenetics or APL. FLT3

mutations are associated with a poor prognosis, particularly the presence of an ITD in conjunction with
loss of the second wild-type allele.18,19
The brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic gene
(BAALC) encodes a protein of unknown function.
High BAALC expression is an independent predictor
of resistance, high CIR, and shorter survival in
patients with AML and normal karyotype.20 Based on
BAALC mRNA expression and FLT3 ITD mutations,
the investigators distinguished 4 subgroups of
patients with diploid AML. Patients with both high
levels of BAALC expression and FLT3 mutations had
the worst survival, whereas patients with neither
mutation did best.20
The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa)
is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of
myelopoiesis. Mutation of the C/EBPa gene occurs in
15% of patients with AML and normal karyotype and
is associated with longer remission and survival.21,22
The effect of the coexpression of FLT3 ITD mutations
and mutated C/EBPa is unclear.21,22
Partial tandem duplication (PTD) of the MLL
gene (located at 11q23) was the first molecular abnormality described to occur in approximately 10%
of patients with AML and normal karyotype.14 MLL
PTD occurs in conjunction with other cytogenetic
abnormalities (such as complex abnormalities) but
less commonly with favorable cytogenetics (such as
inv(16) or t(8;21)).15 The duration of remission was
shorter if MLL PTD was present.16
Nucleophosmin (NPM) is a nucleo-cytoplasmic
protein that shuttles molecules between cellular
compartments. NPM gene mutations have been

described in a rare form of APL with a translocation
involving NPM and RARa and in anaplastic large cell
lymphoma. NPM gene disruptions are seen in
approximately 35% to 50% of patients with AML, particularly those with normal karyotype, and have been
associated with FLT3 mutations.23 The presence of
NPM11 AML is associated with a higher CR rate, longer
survival, and improved event-free survival (EFS).24
A German cooperative group study of 401 patients with
AML and diploid karyotype found that NPM mutations
were frequently associated with FLT3 mutations but
rarely with other mutations.25 In this study, the negative influence of FLT3 mutations overcomes the positive influence of NPM mutations on survival.25
More recently, 872 patients with normal karyotype, ages 16 to 60 years (median age, 48 years),
were evaluated for the presence of molecular alterations including NPM, FLT3 ITD, FLT3 TKD, C/EBPa,
MLL PTD, and NRAS.26 The overall CR rate was 76%.
In a logistic regression model, the NPM11FLT3-ITD2
(P < .0001) and C/EBPa (P 5 .05) genotypes were
associated with induction success and were prognostic for recurrence-free and overall survival. Allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first CR was beneficial only in patients with normal karyotype who did
not have the NPM11FLT3-ITD2 phenotype.26 However, further validation of the impact of FLT3 status
on the outcome of transplants is needed. The MRC
investigators have suggested that neither an autograft
nor an allograft can overcome the adverse prognostic
effect of mutated FLT3 and that the presence of FLT3
mutation should not be an indication for either procedure in first remission.27

Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Ravandi et al.

In summary, several prognostic molecular
abnormalities have been identified that are particularly useful in AML with diploid karyotype. Similar
abnormalities with potential impact on outcome are
being reported for other cytogenetic subgroups. For
example, The presence of c-kit mutations predicts a
worse outcome in patients with favorable risk disease
with inv(16) and t(8;21).28 More recently, polymorphisms in the genes encoding drug-metabolizing
enzymes and DNA repair mechanisms (XPA and
SULTIC2) have also been found to have prognostic
significance.29 New techniques including gene
expression profiling are employed to identify different subgroups of patients.30,31 Whether these subset
profiles will assist in risk stratification or in identification of new molecular targets for therapy remains
to be determined. Increased availability of these markers and their prospective incorporation into large
multicenter trials will further validate their influence
on the outcome of patients.

Treatment Options in Adult AML
Despite multiple clinical trials examining combinations of cytotoxic agents, the standard regimen for
AML induction is 3 days of an anthracycline and 7
days of standard dose cytarabine (3 1 7). Variations
in this regimen have included the incorporation of
high-dose cytarabine,32 double-dose induction, and
the addition of other agents such as etoposide,33
chlorodeoxyadenosine,34 and fludarabine.35
Controversies concern the optimal dose of daunorubicin, whether high-dose cytarabine during
induction would be more effective, if idarubicin is
better than daunorubicin, and which newer agents
may improve outcome. Large trials have compared
idarubicin with daunorubicin in newly diagnosed
AML.36,37 In a study by Wiernik et al.37 there was an
improvement in CR duration for patients who
received idarubicin. In 2 studies, there was a survival
advantage for idarubicin.36,37 However, the difference
in the efficacy of the 2 anthracyclines may not exist
if a higher dose of daunorubicin is used (eg, 60 mg/
m2 or higher, daily for 3 days).
Vignetti et al.38 reported the results of a European study randomizing 2157 patients with AML to
receive induction with daunorubicin (50 mg/m2 daily
for 3 days), mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2 daily for 3
days), or idarubicin (10 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) in
addition to cytarabine and etoposide. In patients
achieving CR, 1 course of consolidation with the
same agents was followed by allogeneic or autologous SCT. The CR rates were similar for the 3 arms
and during induction the recovery times and toxicity
were comparable. However, during consolidation the

1903

incidence of grade 3 and 4 infections was 14% with
daunorubicin, 23% with mitoxantrone, and 24% with
idarubicin. Recovery times were also significantly
longer with mitoxantrone and idarubicin, suggesting
a more pronounced hematopoietic toxicity with
these agents.38 Among patients who did not undergo
SCT, the disease-free survival was significantly superior in the idarubicin and mitoxantrone arms.
High-dose cytarabine (HIDAC) (generally considered as 1 g/m2/dose), as part of induction therapy,
was associated with longer remission duration and
EFS in younger patients (age <60 years).39,40 Kern
and Estey41 performed a pooled analysis of data
from randomized clinical trials that compared
HIDAC with standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC, 0.2
g/m2/dose) during induction in patients with AML.
No differences were noted with regard to CR rates.
However, the use of HIDAC was associated with better long-term disease control and survival in adults
younger than 60 years of age.41
Age, concomitant cardiotoxicity, congestive heart
failure, or other comorbid conditions may prohibit
the use of anthracyclines. Alternative regimens such
as the combination of fludarabine plus cytarabine or
topotecan plus cytarabine have been used.42,43 These
regimens have produced equivalent CR rates and
outcome to standard anthracycline/cytarabine regimens, without any associated cardiotoxicity.44
Prognostic factors are currently used to guide
therapy in specific subsets of patients such as those
with APL or favorable cytogenetics leukemias. Strategies to develop more effective therapies for patients
with other subsets of AML are needed. These
include: novel nucleoside analogs (eg, clofarabine),
strategies to reverse drug resistance (eg, multidrug
resistance, cell cycle inhibition), monoclonal antibodies (eg, gemtuzumab ozogamicin), and molecularly
targeted therapies (eg, FLT-3 inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and farnesyl transferase inhibitors).45 A
detailed discussion of new agents in AML is beyond
the scope of this article and has been reviewed elsewhere.45 Here we focus on selected agents with promising early clinical data.
Several inhibitors of the FLT-3 kinase are undergoing evaluation.46 Lestaurtinib (CEP701) is being
evaluated in the salvage setting. Patients with FLT-3activating mutations are randomized to treatment
with chemotherapy with or without lestaurtinib.47
Preliminary results indicate that the addition of the
FLT-3 inhibitor may improve the response rate. This
agent has also produced clinical responses as firstline treatment in older patients with AML.48
PKC412 is another FLT-3 kinase inhibitor with
single-agent activity in AML.49 Preliminary results

1904

CANCER

showed a favorable CR rate for the combination of
daunorubicin plus cytarabine plus PKC412 in
patients age 60 years or younger with newly diagnosed AML.50 In the latest follow-up of the study, 38
patients (26 with wild-type FLT-3 [FLT-3wt] blasts and
12 with mutated FLT-3 [FLT-3mut] blasts) were evaluable. CR occurred in 27 of 38 (71%); the CR rate in
patients with FLT-3wt was 18 of 26 (69%) and in
patients with FLT-3mut 11 of 12 (92%).50 Another
agent, tandutinib (MLN518), has shown antileukemic
activity in early trials.51
Tipifarnib (R115777) is a nonpeptidomimetic farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that has been combined with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of
AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
(blasts >10%).52 Induction with idarubicin, cytarabine, and tipifarnib was followed by 5 courses of
attenuated dose consolidation and by maintenance
with single-agent tipifarnib for 6 months. There was
no improvement in CR rate or remission duration
and an increase in toxicity, particularly diarrhea and
liver dysfunction.52 Karp et al.53 are testing the role
of tipifarnib in maintenance in a phase 2 trial for
patients with poor-risk AML in CR after induction
and consolidation.
Aberrant DNA methylation, and other epigenetic
events, are important in the progression of a number
of human neoplasms.54 Methylation of promoterassociated CpG-rich regions (CpG islands) can lead
to silencing and inactivation of tumor suppressor
genes, acting as an alternative mechanism to deletions and mutations.55 Methylation of promoters of
genes such as p15 have been associated with disease
progression and with worse outcome in myeloid
malignancies.56 Decitabine (5-aza-20 -deoxycitidine)
irreversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNAMT),
enzymes that methylate newly synthesized DNA,
leading to hypomethylation of the promoters of
tumor suppressor genes and their activation.54 Decitabine and 5-azacytidine, either alone or in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors, are
currently under evaluation for the treatment of
patients with AML.57 A recent reanalysis of data
from 3 sequential CALGB trials of 5-azacytidine
demonstrated that among 103 patients with AML at
baseline (using World Health Organization [WHO]
criteria), 48% had hematologic improvement or better responses.58

Role of Maintenance Therapy
Maintenance therapy is a well-established strategy in
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)59 but has not
become part of routine treatment of AML due to
conflicting results from prior clinical trials. An early

study by ECOG randomized patients age younger
than 60 years in remission to no further therapy,
short-term high dose consolidation therapy, or prolonged maintenance.60 The observation arm of the
study was closed early due to a significantly poorer
outcome compared with maintenance (P 5 .002). In
a follow-up report, the same investigators compared
the long-term outcome of patients age younger than
41 years with no available donor for a transplant
who were randomized to either 2 years of continuous
outpatient maintenance therapy with cytarabine and
6-thioguanine or a single course of in-patient highdose cytarabine-based consolidation therapy.61 The
EFS and survival were significantly better for patients
who received consolidation therapy.
A randomized study by the CALGB demonstrated
that protracted maintenance for 36 months was not
superior to 8 months of maintenance.62 Sauter
et al.63 reported that patients in remission after a
course of consolidation who were assigned to maintenance chemotherapy every 8 weeks for 2 years did
not do better than those randomized to observation
only. In studies by the German AML cooperative
group, patients achieving CR were randomized to
protracted maintenance or no further therapy.64–66
Monthly maintenance after consolidation was superior to consolidation alone in prolonging the remission duration.64–66 The benefit of this strategy was
particularly evident in patients with poor-risk features, defined by unfavorable karyotype, age 60
years, high lactate dehydrogenous levels, or residual
Day 16 bone marrow blasts >40% (P 5 .006).65 In
another European study, patients in CR received 1
cycle of consolidation therapy and were randomized
to no further therapy or low-dose cytarabine at 42day intervals for a total of 8 cycles or until recurrence.67 Low-dose cytarabine prolonged recurrencefree survival but not overall survival.67 In a study
conducted by SWOG, patients ineligible or unable to
undergo an allogeneic SCT were randomized to
receive intensification alone or intensification followed by monthly maintenance. In multivariate analysis, maintenance was associated with a prolonged
disease-free survival (DFS) but not survival.68
The available data suggest that maintenance
therapy with cytotoxic drugs similar to those used in
induction and consolidation leads to improved DFS
in AML. A potential reason for the lack of success of
maintenance therapy in improving survival in AML is
the use of drugs with mechanisms of action similar
to those used in the induction-consolidation therapy.
These drugs are not discriminatory toward malignant
myeloid cells, are toxic to the normal hematopoietic
myeloid progenitors, and the residual leukemia cells

Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Ravandi et al.

are likely to be resistant to their effect. This argues
for the use of alternative agents with different
mechanisms of action. The use of immune-modulating agents like interleukin-2 (IL-2) in an effort to stimulate the host antileukemic immune effect has
been evaluated in the postremission setting.69 In a
recent international randomized trial, 320 patients
with AML in CR were stratified by CR1 or subsequent
CR (CR >1) and randomized to treatment with IL-2
plus histamine dihydrochloride or no treatment.70
Patients in the experimental arm had significantly
longer leukemia-free survival compared with those in
the control arm (40% vs 26% at 3 years; P 5 .01).
Other agents such as hypomethylating agents, FTIs,
and vaccines may have a potential role in this
setting.

Management of AML in the Elderly
Treatment of elderly patients with AML is challenging and deserves a separate mention. The U.K. AML
trial experience since the 1970s showed that the proportion of patients who achieve 5-year or 10-year
survival remains very low.4 Results from the AML11
trial showed no difference in survival with different
types of regimens or different lengths of treatment.71
The design of the AML14 trial included selection of
intensive or nonintensive chemotherapy for patients
older than age 60 years with AML. This study, which
included 1237 patients, demonstrated no difference
in CR rate or overall survival with high-dose or lowdose daunorubicin, low-dose or high-dose cytarabine
induction, or 3 or 4 total courses of therapy.72 The
5-year survival for intensive chemotherapy was 13%.72
Results from the nonintensive chemotherapy
arm of the AML14 trial showed that median survival
significantly improved with low-dose cytarabine (20
mg twice daily for 10 days, every 4 to 6 weeks) compared with hydroxyurea.73 CR occurred in 1 of 92
(1%) patients in the hydroxyurea treatment arm and
in 15 of 92 (17%) patients in the low-dose cytarabine
arm. Benefits were limited to patients who had intermediate-risk karyotype.
Appelbaum et al.2 analyzed data from 5 SWOG
clinical trials that included 968 patients. Increasing
age was associated with less favorable cytogenetics,
poorer performance status scores, lower white blood
cell counts, and a lower percentage of marrow blasts.
Increasing age was also associated with a higher incidence of early death after induction therapy, a lower
CR rate, and shorter survival.
The poor outcome of elderly patients with AML
has led to the search for less toxic and more effective
agents in this setting. Gemtuzumab ozogamycin has

1905

been approved for treating older patients (age 60
years) with AML in first recurrence with CR1 duration of >3 months.74 Gemtuzumab is not used
widely to treat these patients due to its possible liver
toxicity. Among the patients treated on the U.K.
AML15 trial, which combined gemtuzumab with
chemotherapy in predominantly younger patients,
approximately 140 patients aged 60 years and older
were treated. Preliminary data indicate that these
patients had a high CR rate of 82%.75 This study is
likely to generate further interest in combining low
doses of gemtuzumab with chemotherapy in both
the adult and elderly populations.75
The adenosine nucleoside analog clofarabine
was recently approved for the treatment of pediatric
patients with refractory or recurring ALL. Clofarabine
is being evaluated as monotherapy or in combination
for the treatment of older patients with AML. Faderl
et al.76 reported the results of a phase 2 study of clofarabine (40 mg/m2 given as a 1-hour infusion on
Days 2–6) plus intermediate dose cytarabine (1 g/m2
daily given as a 2-hour infusion for 5 days) in
patients aged 50 years or older with newly diagnosed
AML. Among the 60 enrolled patients, 48% had secondary AML and 50% had abnormal karyotype. The
overall response rate was 60% (52% CR rate and 8%
CR without platelet recovery [CRp]); myelosuppression was frequent but other toxicities were mostly grade
2 or lower. Four patients (7%) died during induction.
In another study, patients aged 60 years or older
with untreated AML were randomized to a lower
dose of clofarabine monotherapy (30 mg/m2, Days 1
through 5) or the same dose of clofarabine plus lowdose cytarabine (20 mg/m2 daily, Days 1 through
14).77 The addition of low-dose cytarabine to this
lower dose of clofarabine improved the CR rate compared with clofarabine monotherapy.78 Unfortunately,
due to the Bayesian randomization strategy, very few
patients were treated with single-agent clofarabine. A
phase 2 trial of single-agent clofarabine (30 mg/m2/
day given intravenously every day for 5 days, every
28 days) in older patients (age >65 years) with previously untreated AML with a nonfavorable cytogenetic profile for whom standard intensive treatment
is deemed unsuitable has been conducted in Europe.79 Among the 66 enrolled patients, 69% had intermediate-risk cytogenetics and 31% had adverserisk cytogenetics. Twenty-five percent had secondary
AML and 74% presented with 1 or more comorbidities. Preliminary efficacy data demonstrated an
encouraging 48% overall CR and CRp rate and little
difference in response rates among patients with intermediate versus unfavorable karyotypes.79 Based
on these results, a phase 2 study in patients aged

transplantation; Chemo, chemotherapy.

60 years old or older with a high mortality risk not fit
for intensive therapy currently is under way in the
U.S.
Tipifarnib has been used in patients age older
than 65 years with previously untreated AML and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In a recent study,
14% of 158 elderly patients with poor-risk AML
achieved a CR.80 Partial remission or hematologic
improvement occurred in 15 patients for an overall
response rate of 23%. The median duration of CR
was 7.3 months and the median survival of complete
responders was 18 months. Adverse karyotype, age
75 years, and poor performance status were found
to be negatively correlated with survival. Early death
in the absence of progressive disease was rare; drugrelated nonhematologic serious adverse events were
observed in 74 patients (47%).80
Cloretazine, a sulfonylhydrazine alkylating agent,
has demonstated activity as monotherapy in first recurrence of AML after an initial CR lasting less than
12 months.81 An ongoing phase 2 trial is evaluating
cloretazine in patients aged 60 years or older with
chemotherapy-naive AML or high-risk MDS. A total
of 107 patients were treated.82 The CR rate was 47%
in de novo AML and 11% in secondary AML. Induction mortality was 18%. An ongoing phase 3 trial is
examining the activity of cytarabine with or without
cloretazine in AML in first recurrence.

Stem Cell Transplantation
Allogeneic SCT for early consolidation therapy in
patients with AML in first remission has been evaluated since early studies of transplantation. Several
studies have attempted to define the optimal transplant strategy. In prospective trials, patients age
younger than 55 years, in first CR, and with an
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling
were assigned to allogeneic transplantation (Table 3).

Those with no donor were randomized to receive an
autologous transplantation or further chemotherapy.83–86 Overall, these trials suggested a possible
advantage for allogeneic transplantation in patients
with poor-risk cytogenetics, although long-term
results remain poor. To our knowledge, there is no
clear advantage with any of these modalities in
patients with other cytogenetic risk groups with the
exception of those with inv(16) and t(8;21), who fare
better with chemotherapy. A recent study of 872
patients with diploid AML treated in 4 German trials
evaluated the prognostic impact of NPM1, FLT3, C/
EBPa , MLL, and NRAS gene mutations on survival after different postremission therapies.26 They reported
a strong benefit for allogeneic SCT in first CR only in
the subgroup of patients without the NPM11FLT3ITD2 marker constellation.26 Therefore, in patients
with diploid cytogenetics, allogeneic SCT should be
considered in first CR only for those without NPM11
FLT3-ITD2.
Newer transplantation strategies such as nonmyeloablative transplants, use of intravenous busulfan, and better management of graft-versus-host
disease have permitted extension of the transplanteligible age, and may lead to a better efficacy/toxicity
ratio for this procedure in the future.87–89 To our
knowledge to date, there are no randomized trials
confirming the benefit of nonmyeloablative SCT in
older patients with AML. However, retrospective
comparative studies have demonstrated that, in older
patients, this strategy may be superior to the traditional transplants.90 Furthermore, the reduced toxicity associated with these less intensive regimens may
allow their use in high-risk groups otherwise not suited for transplants.91 Although autologous transplant
is used commonly for consolidation of remission, no
randomized data to date have demonstrated a survival benefit compared with consolidation chemotherapy.

Conclusions
Recent developments in understanding the biology
of AML have provided multiple targets for developing
agents with potential activity against the disease. It is
likely that a number of these agents, singly or in
combination, will be effective against subgroups of
patients with AML. It is also likely that these agents
will complement traditional and newly developed cytotoxic agents used for treating AML. New strategies,
such as maintenance therapy to suppress minimal
residual disease using 1 or more of these agents, may
prove effective in improving survival.
