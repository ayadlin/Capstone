Abstract
Cancer evolution is a process that is still poorly understood because of the lack of versatile in vivo longitudinal
studies. By generating murine non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) orthoallobanks and paired primary cell lines,
we provide a detailed description of an in vivo, time-dependent cancer malignization process. We identify the
acquisition of metastatic dissemination potential, the selection of co-driver mutations, and the appearance of
naturally occurring intratumor heterogeneity, thus recapitulating the stochastic nature of human cancer
development. This approach combines the robustness of genetically engineered cancer models with the ﬂexibility
of allograft methodology. We have applied this tool for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutic approaches.
This system can be implemented to improve the design of future treatments for patients with NSCLC. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of
cases, with a 5-year survival rate below 15% (1). To improve
control over this devastating disease, a variety of in vivo

preclinical models have been used during the last decade.
Among those, subcutaneous xenografts of human NSCLC cell
lines have been extensively applied for drug sensitivity assays
(2). Alternatively, intrapulmonary delivery of human cell lines
in nude mice has provided a more clinically relevant system to
study NSCLC biology (3). However, these methodologies still
present some disadvantages. In particular, it is troublesome to
obtain a single intraparenchymatous lung tumor that mimics
the clinical situation and allows longitudinal follow-up. Indeed,
localized intrapulmonary disease accounts for the majority of
patients with NSCLC and is the basis of further tumor progression. In parallel, genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMM) have become indispensable tools for our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to tumor development
as well as for treatment design and target validation demands.
However, GEMM lung tumors induced by a single initiating
oncogene are predominantly early-stage lesions, display limited histologic variation, and metastasize rather infrequently
(4).
In sum, there is an urgent necessity to establish suitable
animal models of NSCLC that faithfully recapitulate every
salient aspect of the human disease. Here, we report a versatile
and reproducible approach that circumvents important disadvantages of preexisting animal models of NSCLC, in particular those associated with low histologic heterogeneity and
lack of spontaneous metastasis. This methodology is based on
sequential orthotopic implantation of small solid fragments
from an individual murine primary tumor into recipient mice.
With this approach, we have generated an NSCLC orthoallobank: a comprehensive archived collection of serially passaged
murine lung adenocarcinomas together with paired cell lines.
This methodology enables full recapitulation of human NSCLC
histopathologic features, including selection of mutations in

relevant tumor suppressors together with metastatic dissemination. Our method offers a powerful tool to study the poorly
characterized progression toward full-blown metastatic adenocarcinomas present at the time of diagnose in human
patients. Moreover, it provides a rapid and standardized
platform for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutic treatments in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Animals
The K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo; RERTert/ert strain has been previously described (5). Lung tumors were induced by intraperitoneal
injection of 4-hydroxitamoxifen as previously described (5).
EML4-ALK mice will be reported elsewhere (Voena and colleagues, manuscript submitted). In brief, a cDNA fragment
encoding EML4-ALK (variant 1) was ligated to the surfactant
protein-C (SP-C) promoter as well as to a polyadenylation
signal. The expression cassette was injected into pronuclear
stage embryos of FVB/N mice. The presence of the transgene
was examined by PCR analysis after extraction of DNA from the
tail of founder animals. RT-PCR analysis was performed to
detect EML4-ALK mRNA to conﬁrm the lung-speciﬁc expression of the transgene. Crl:NU-Foxn1nu mice were purchased
from Charles River. All animal experiments were approved by
the Ethical Committee of CNIO and IDIBELL and performed in
accordance with the guidelines for Ethical Conduct in the Care
and Use of Animals as stated in The International Guiding
Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, developed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical
Sciences (CIOMS).
Orthotopic implantation in Crl:NU-Foxn1nu mice
Primary tumors from inducible K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo or EML4ALK mice were aseptically isolated and placed at room temperature in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS plus 50 U/mL
penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin. Within 12 hours from
surgical resection, tumors were implanted in Crl:NU-Foxn1nu
mice following previously reported procedures (3). Brieﬂy,
mice were anesthetized with a continuous ﬂow of 1% to 3%
isoﬂurane/oxygen mixture (2 L/min) and subjected to right
thoracotomy. Mice were situated in left lateral decubitus
position, and a small transverse skin incision (5–8 mm) was
made in the right chest wall. Chest muscles were separated by a
sharp dissection and costal and intercostals muscles were
exposed. An intercostal incision of 2 to 4 mm on the third or
fourth rib on the chest wall was made and a small tumor piece
of 2 to 4 mm3 was introduced into the chest cavity. The tumor
specimen was deposited following two alternative surgical
procedures: (i) tumor specimens were deposited between the
second and the third lung lobule and (ii) for the chemotherapeutic approach, tumor specimens were anchored to the lung
surface with Prolene 7.0 suture. Next, the chest wall incision
was closed with surgery staples, and ﬁnally chest muscles and
skin were closed. Mice were inspected twice a week and
monitored for the presence of breathing problems. On average,
implanted lung tumours were harvested at humane endpoint,
cut into small fragments, and serially transplanted into two to

three new animals. These engrafted tumors (named orthoallografts) were also cryopreserved as 2 to 4 mm3 pieces in a
solution of 90% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in
liquid nitrogen for subsequent future implantations. In addition, a fresh small piece was used to derive matched cell lines in
vitro when appropriate (see below).
In vivo drug treatments
K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo orthoallografts were implanted in Crl:
NU-Foxn1nu mice and randomly allocated into the treatment
groups. Mice were intravenously treated at days 7, 12, and 17
(cisplatin, 3 mg/kg; paclitaxel, 20 mg/kg) and sacriﬁced at day
22 postimplantation.
EML4-ALK orthoallografts were implanted in Crl:NUFoxn1nu mice and randomly allocated into the treatment
groups. Crizotinib (100 mg/kg) was administered daily by oral
gavage starting on day 60 postimplantation and continued
during 10 days. Upon completion of both treatments, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained lung sections were blindly
assessed by a pathologist. Crizotinib (PF-02341066) was a kind
gift from Pﬁzer Inc.
Micro PET-CT imaging and analysis
Images were acquired using eXplore Vista PET-CT (GE
Healthcare). Mice were injected with 15MBq of 18F-FDG into
the lateral tail vein in a volume of 100 mL. During imaging, mice
were anesthetized with a continuous ﬂow of 1% to 3% isoﬂurane/oxygen mixture (2 L/min). Forty-ﬁve minutes after
radiotracer injection, micro-CT images were acquired at 400
projections and collected in one full rotation of the gantry in
approximately 10 minutes. Micro PET scans were performed at
20 minutes per bed. CT images were reconstructed using
ﬁltered back projection with a Shepp–Logan ﬁlter and PET
images with 3D OSEM reconstruction algorithm. 18F-FDG
(2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) PET-CT images were analyzed using Amide Medical Image Data Examiner (AMIDE)
software for evaluation of tumor 18F-FDG uptake. 18F-FDG
uptake is indicated as maximal standardized uptake value
(SUV Max), and was calculated by drawing a 3-dimensional
(3D) region of interest (ROI) over the tumor applying the
formula SUV ¼ ROI radioactivity concentration (MBq/cc)/
injected dose (MBq)/mice body weight (g).
Generation of murine K-RasG12V NSCLC cell lines and
single-cell clones
Freshly collected lung tumor tissues coming from
K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo and EML4-ALK orthotopic implants were
minced with sterile scalpels. Single cells and clumps were
transferred to cell culture plates and maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS plus 50 U/mL penicillin and 50
mg/mL streptomycin under standard culture conditions.
When cell colonies with epithelial cell morphology were
observed, cells were trypsinized and expanded. For the
single-cell colony generation, cells were diluted with culture
medium to obtain a concentration of approximately 1 cell/
100mL and seeded in 96-well plates (100mL/well). After 12
hours, each well was carefully examined by bright-ﬁeld
microscopy. Wells containing single cells with epithelial

morphology were marked, and the culture medium in such
wells was changed every 3 days. Expanded cell populations
derived from these colonies were subjected to further characterization. When appropriate, doxorubicin (SigmaAldrich) was used at 5 mg/mL.
For X-Gal staining, cultured cells were ﬁxed with 0.2%
glutaraldehyde for 15 minutes and incubated in X-Gal staining
solution (0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 5
mmol/L potassium ferrocyanide, and 5 mmol/L potassium
ferricyanide containing 1 mg/mL X-Gal [5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-b-D-galactosidase]) for 12 to 16 hours at 37 C.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA (1 mg), extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN), was reverse-transcribed by random primers using
SuperScript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen),
and the reverse transcription reaction (1 mL) was then subjected to PCR ampliﬁcation using FastStart Universal SYBR
Green Master (Roche). PCR signals were recorded on a
StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and
analyzed using the StepOne version 2.2 software (Applied
Biosystems). Primer sets were the following:

Western blotting
About 25 mg of protein extracts obtained from cell lysates
was separated on SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with primary antibodies
raised against p53 (Cell Signaling Technology), p21 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and GAPDH (Sigma).
Tumorigenicity assays
Cells (1  106) were resuspended in 200 mL of sterile PBS and
then inoculated by tail vein injection into Crl:NU-Foxn1nu mice
of 6 to 10 weeks of age. Animals were euthanized at different
time points postinoculation, and whole lungs or individual
lung tumors were collected.
Histopathology
For routine histologic study, lung lobes were ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin (Sigma) and embedded in parafﬁn. Parafﬁn
sections (5 mm thick) were then processed for either H&E
staining or immunohistochemistry. Images were acquired with
a LEICA DM4000B microscope equipped with LEICA DC500
digital camera. Antibodies used for immunostaining included
those raised against cleaved caspase-3 (R&D Systems), cytokeratin-7, and thyroid transcription factor 1 (Abcam).

Results
Establishment and validation of an orthoallobank of
murine NSCLC by orthotopic implantation in Crl:NUFoxn1nu mice
To develop orthotopic lung cancer implants, we took
advantage of the inducible K-RasG12V model that was engineered as a silent knock-in mutation preceded by a ﬂoxed
transcription stop cassette (Lox-Stop-Lox or LSL). Activation
of the K-RasLSLG12Vgeo allele is achieved upon Cre recombinase–mediated excision of the stop cassette, resulting in the
development of NSCLC (6). To generate a more aggressive
model, we used the K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo strain that includes a
ﬂoxed version of the K-Ras wild-type allele. In this compound
strain, delivery of the Cre recombinase results in expression of
the oncogenic mutation together with the concomitant ablation of the wild-type copy of K-Ras (5). With this approach, we
recapitulated the recurrent LOH event as found in 50% of
human lung tumors with K-Ras activating mutations (7).
A total of 46 primary NSCLC tumors were isolated from four
K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo mice upon appearance of breathing difﬁculties (on average 11 months subsequent to oncogene induction). These primary lesions displayed limited histologic heterogeneity and were mainly classiﬁed as solid or papillary
adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Table S1). All tumors were
individually implanted in the right parieto-pleural lung region
of Crl:NU-Foxn1nu mice (hereafter nude mice) following a
surgical procedure that can be easily implemented in any
standard animal facility. Twenty-seven (60%) implanted
tumors successfully engrafted and were able to grow as orthotopic implants through a period of time ranging from 98 to 150
days from implantation to humane endpoint (Supplementary
Table S1). We observed that papillary primary tumors
engrafted more efﬁciently (82%) when compared with solid
tumors (50%). In 12 cases (26%), tumors did not grow through a
follow-up period of 6 months, whereas the remaining seven
animals had to be prematurely euthanized because of postoperative complications.
Passage #1 implants were used to perform consecutive
mouse-to-mouse serial transplantations, resulting in faster
tumor growth and consequently shorter lifespan (Supplementary Table S1). At the humane endpoint of every passage, all
tumors were harvested and cryopreserved to create a comprehensive NSCLC orthoallobank. In addition, we embedded in
parafﬁn and snap froze all implants upon conclusion of every
passage to generate an inclusive archive of samples for future
analysis. To check the viability of cryopreserved samples, we
thawed and orthotopically reimplanted four different secondpassage orthoallografts (oag-9, oag-12, oag-21, and oag-22)
chosen to represent the three most frequent histologic subtypes (papillary, acinar, and solid; Supplementary Table S2).
Importantly, these tumors not only successfully engrafted but
also displayed median passage duration and histologic features
indistinguishable from paired samples implanted without the
cryopreservation step. Next, to test its suitability as a practical
tool for the validation of preclinical treatments, we assessed
whether the evolution of implanted tumors could be followedup by standard imaging technology. To this end, we analyzed a

cohort of animals orthotopically implanted with cryopreserved
tumors by PET following injection of 18F-FDG. Tumor-speciﬁc
FDG-PET signal was readily measurable upon implantation
and increased during the course of the experiment becoming
detectable in other lung lobules (Fig. 1A and B). This was
further documented by post-mortem histopathologic analysis
(Fig. 1C).
Finally, to prove whether this methodology could be extended to other driver oncogenes found in human NSCLC, we
implanted murine primary lung tumors derived from EML4ALK transgenic mice (Voena and colleagues, manuscript submitted; see Materials and Methods). Eleven tumors were
orthotopically implanted in nude mice, resulting in four successful engraftments (36%). The observed frequency of engraftment increased to 77% when the procedure was replicated with
EML4-ALK; p53/ primary tumors (Supplementary Table S3).
All these lesions were also subjected to sequential passages (up
to passage #3) and cryopreserved. This indicates that the
methodology described above can be potentially extended to
primary tumors from virtually any alternative GEMM.

NSCLC orthoallografts faithfully recapitulate human
disease including histologic heterogeneity and
progressive malignization over time
In humans, invasive adenocarcinoma represents 60% to 70%
of all surgically resected lung cancer cases. According to the
predominant histologic pattern, adenocarcinomas can be further classiﬁed in differentiated (comprising lepidic, acinar,
papillary, and micropapillary) and undifferentiated/solid subtypes (8). However, lung tumors in K-Ras mutant mice display
much lower complexity than human NSCLC. Indeed, the
heterogeneity of human disease is poorly represented in primary tumors from K-Raslox/LSLG12Vgeo mice, which predominantly display a differentiated pattern (Supplementary Table
S1; see also ref. 9). In sharp contrast, orthoallografts obtained
after a single passage in nude mice closely reproduced the
diverse histologic appearance of human NSCLC. Unlike what
we observed in the originating primary tumors, the most
representative histologic subtypes found in human cancers
appeared with variable frequency in the orthoallograft collection (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2).

We next asked whether the serial passaging of NSCLC
orthoallografts could reveal a tendency to acquire increased
malignancy over time. This is an important aspect, as the initial
stages of malignization are difﬁcult to be approached in
humans. To this end, a group of representative primary tumors
(n ¼ 6) including predominant differentiated and undifferentiated histologic subtypes were passed mouse-to-mouse in the
course of up to four sequential passages (Supplementary Table
S4). As an initial evidence of increased malignancy, we ﬁrst
examined whether orthoallografts may have accumulated
mutations with prognostic value. We focused our search to
the tumor suppressor genes p53 and Lkb1 (also known as
Stk11), as both present the highest frequency of co-occurrence
with K-Ras activating mutations in advanced human NSCLC
(10). While we failed to detect changes in the most frequently
mutated p53 exons (exons 4, 6, and 7), on average, 10% of the
tumor cells in two of the 13 orthoallografts analyzed presented
aberrations in the Lkb1 gene, a frequently mutated gene in
human NSCLC (11). We detected one nonsynonymous
mutation (D162G) and one deletion (E354D) affecting the Lkb1
protein kinase and C-terminal regulatory domains, respec-

tively (Fig. 2A). These regions concentrate most Lkb1
cancer–related mutations in humans (11). Importantly, Lkb1
aberrations were not identiﬁed in the originating passage #1
implants (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the expression of the tumor
suppressor p16 was decreased in late-passage samples, thus
resembling the loss of p16 in human NSCLC progression
(Fig. 2B; ref. 12). Finally, it has been proposed that expression
of embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers correlates with undifferentiated NSCLC and is associated with worse prognosis (13).
We took advantage of an RT-PCR array to measure the
expression changes of a collection of established ESC markers
during the orthotopic sequential transplantation (data not
shown). Klf4, Oct4, c-Myc, CD24, and Lgr6 displayed a higher
expression fold change in late- versus early-passage implants in
a cohort of paired samples (n ¼ 8; Fig. 2B).
We further collected other evidences that suggested an
evolution toward a more malignant phenotype during the
serial passaging of orthoallografts. First, we observed that the
period from tumor implantation to humane endpoint was
progressively shortened along the serial transplantation procedure. Yet, beyond passage #3, this period remained constant

Lung Cancer Malignization In Vivo

(Fig. 3A). In all cases and irrespectively of passage duration,
when the initial implant predominantly displayed solid features, we did not observe major histologic changes through
passages being the engrafted tumor histologically stable (data
not shown). In contrast, those implants that initially showed a
predominant differentiated pattern eventually displayed an
increase in the incidence of the solid subtype (Fig. 3B). Importantly, despite of the increment of undifferentiated components, these tumors maintained some degree of histologic
heterogeneity as also observed in human biopsies (Supplementary Table S3).
Notably, in addition to their close histologic resemblance to
human NSCLC, orthoallografts displayed metastatic potential
as early as passage #1. This is in sharp contrast to K-Ras mutant
GEMM models that lack metastatic capacity unless additional
genetic modiﬁcations are included (4). As mentioned above
and akin to human disease, the engrafted implants frequently
invade neighboring lung lobules and disseminate to various
locations forming macroscopic implants in the diaphragm,
ribs, chest cavity, lymph nodes, and liver (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, careful histopathologic scrutiny of brain and liver sections, two of the main metastatic target tissues of primary
human NSCLC, revealed the presence of micrometastasis in 7
of 21 (33%) implant-bearing animals (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Table S5).
Murine NSCLC cell lines generated from primary and
metastatic tumors are p53-proﬁcient
Thus far, it has been unfeasible to efﬁciently establish
murine NSCLC cell lines that are p53-proﬁcient. This is
particularly relevant, as 50% of human NSCLC cases retain a

wild-type p53 (14). In an attempt to establish such primary cell
lines, orthotopic implants were resected and mechanically
disaggregated immediately after passage #1 and maintained
in culture under standard conditions. Following this approach,
a panel of 35 murine K-RasG12V lung cancer (mKLC) cell lines
was successfully derived from their corresponding orthoallografts. The process of cell line generation occurred with similar
efﬁciency irrespectively of the predominant histologic subtype.
Yet, the paired metastatic cell lines predominantly originate
from solid orthoallografts (Supplementary Table S6). To assess
whether these cell lines retained metastatic dissemination
potential, a cohort of mice received a cell line derived from
a diaphragmatic implant via tail vein injection. As expected
because of the inoculation route, all animals developed pulmonary nodules. Remarkably, the injected animals also developed macroscopic tumors in various tissues such as lymph
nodes, bone, liver, adrenal gland, ovary, skin, and salivary gland,
thereby resembling the metastatic pattern reported in human
patients with NSCLC (Fig. 4 and data not shown).
Next, four mKLC lines were further characterized in vitro. To
conﬁrm expression of K-RasG12V and the absence of stromal
contaminants, we took advantage of the surrogate marker
b-geo, inserted as a bicistronic transcript at the 30 –untranslated region (UTR) of the K-Ras locus (6). As expected, all cell
lines displayed strong X-Gal staining, indicative of K-RasG12V
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Although all cell lines
showed a characteristic morphology evocative of an epithelial
origin, we nevertheless assessed by RT-PCR the expression of
prototypical epithelial markers such as cytokeratin 13, cytokeratin 19, and E-cadherin along with the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin. All tested mKLC cell lines

expressed these epithelial markers (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Interestingly, we also observed increased levels of vimentin and
N-cadherin when compared with primary tumors, suggesting
the acquisition of a mesenchymal-like phenotype as previously
reported for other epithelial cancer cell lines in vitro (15).
p53 is known to be stabilized in response to DNA damage
and other stress signals, resulting in the induction of several
downstream targets that mediate a variety of cellular
responses such as cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis (16). To assess
p53 functionality, we exposed the mKLC lines to the genotoxic
agent doxorubicin. This treatment resulted in clear p53 stabilization together with an induction of the p53 transcriptional
target p21, indicating that mKLC cell lines derived by an
orthoallograft procedure can be efﬁciently established preserving a functional p53 response (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Cell-autonomous determination of NSCLC histologic
heterogeneity
Considering that undifferentiated histopathologic subtypes
are associated with poor prognosis in human patients with
NSCLC (17), we set out to assess the capacity of our mKLC cell
lines to fully reconstitute tumor heterogeneity in vivo. To this
end, we used grafting by tail vein injection to favor lung

colonization and performed a time course study to investigate
tumor progression. Injection of 1  106 cells resulted in tumor
formation that recapitulated the histologic heterogeneity as
well as time-dependent evolution observed in the orthoallografted tumors. Whereas early stages (12 days) were characterized by small nodules of tumor cells with focal acinar
differentiation, tumor progression invariably resulted in the
appearance of adenocarcinomas with predominant solid
features at humane endpoint (25 days; Supplementary Fig.
S3). Importantly, the presence of a variable contribution of
other histologic subtypes was also identiﬁed in a cell line–
dependent manner (data not shown). We next aimed to
assess whether this histologic heterogeneity, also observed
in the majority of orthotopic implants as well as in human
disease, was the result of a mosaic composition of cells of
different nature or instead a reﬂection of inherent cellular
plasticity in vivo. To this end, we generated single-cell clones
starting from mKLC mass cultures and injected them via tail
vein into recipient mice. Remarkably, single-cell clones were
able to generate lung lesions displaying different histologic
subtypes with variable composition depending on the individual clone (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Orthotopic implants as a model for preclinical
evaluation of therapeutic intervention
We next wanted to assess whether the orthotopic implants
could be used to anticipate therapeutic response in the clinic.
To this end, we subjected nude mice implanted with K-RasG12V
orthoallografts to the current standard of care for patients with
NSCLC consisting of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (cisplatin
plus paclitaxel). As shown in Fig. 5A, the cohort receiving
chemotherapy showed a reduction in tumor burden when
compared with those receiving vehicle alone. This was accompanied by the appearance of abnormal nuclei in the majority of
cells, displaying enlarged, irregular, or multinucleated morphology (Fig. 5B). Overall, this response and the resulting
histopathologic changes recapitulate the clinical outcome
observed in patients with NSCLC subjected to this chemotherapeutic regime (18, 19).
Next, we aimed to extend our approach to a targeted therapy
currently used in clinical practice with patients with NSCLC.
Because there are no targeted treatments available for K-Ras
mutant tumors, we studied the EML4-ALK model for which a
crizotinib-based therapy is already in use in the clinic. Patients
with NSCLC harboring an EML4-ALK inversion show an initial
response accompanied by substantial tumor regression but
this is inevitably followed by the acquisition of resistance (20).
Interestingly, mice carrying EML4-ALK implants displayed a
substantial tumor burden reduction when subjected to crizotinib treatment (Fig. 5C), with viable tumor areas scattered
among necrotic and ﬁbrotic tissue that may be responsible for
future relapse (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Table S7).

Discussion
We describe a novel and reproducible methodology based
on sequential orthotopic implantation of primary tumors in
recipient mice that circumvents most of the disadvantages

associated with murine models of NSCLC such as the presence
of low histologic heterogeneity and lack of spontaneous metastasis. With this approach, we have been able to document
cancer evolution toward an increased malignant phenotype.
This time-dependent evolutionary trend had been previously
postulated for the progression of human NSCLC but lacked
formal experimental evidence. In our model, the progressive
acquisition of malignant traits is supported by several
observations:

time toward an increase in more undifferentiated
histologic subtypes that resemble those associated with
poor prognosis in humans.
4. Both K-RasG12V- and EML4-ALK–driven implants are
responsive to chemotherapy and crizotinib, respectively,
but invariably display viable tumor cells posttreatment.
5. Serial transplantation allowed for the ﬁrst time the
generation of p53-proﬁcient murine NSCLC primary cell
lines.

1. Serial passaging results in increased local invasion
together with acquisition of distant metastatic potential
displaying the same dissemination tropism observed in
humans.
2. Similarly to advanced human NSCLC, serial passaging
results in the acquisition of tumor-promoting mutations
as well as loss of expression of relevant tumor suppressor
genes. These alterations were not found in the original
primary lesions, suggesting that they are progressively
enriched as a consequence of ﬁtness advantage and
selective pressure.
3. Marked intratumor heterogeneity is generated by NSCLC
cell lines originating form single cells and evolves over

The orthoallobank is a powerful tool to allow a comprehensive study of NSCLC evolution (Fig. 6). Our approach is
well suited for the study of tumor features from a cellautonomous perspective such as target validation exercises
(both genetically and pharmacologically based), appearance
of resistance mechanisms, and the contribution of stromal
components. However, it is now accepted that the immune
system plays both host-protective and tumor-promoting
functions that inﬂuence various important aspects from
tumor onset to metastatic dissemination (21, 22). In this
context, the lack of a functional adaptive immune response
represents an obvious limitation. The implementation of this
technology in syngeneic mice is ongoing and will facilitate

the analysis of the immune system contribution, resulting
in a more comprehensive approach (data not shown). The
collection of archived samples may be used to characterize
by deep sequencing technologies the order of genomic
events that eventually lead to the establishment of aggressive NSCLC. This is particularly relevant, as in humans, many
of the co-driver mutations that trigger or inﬂuence the
progression of the disease remain poorly deﬁned. They
appear with variable frequency and are often difﬁcult to
set apart from the substantial number of passenger mutations. Because there is no ﬁtness advantage associated with
passenger mutations, their accumulation during tumor
development is largely proportional to time (23). Because
of the relatively short period from implantation to malignization, this orthotopic allograft approach may diminish
the chances to accumulate passenger mutations. Instead,
those that play a relevant role during tumor development
will be selected for, thus facilitating their identiﬁcation.
Indeed, we have identiﬁed mutations in the tumor suppressor gene Lkb1 identical to those previously reported in
human NSCLC. Among those, the D162 mutation has been
shown to be important for the structural integrity of human
LKB1, and mutations affecting this residue have been
reported in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome and other types of

5986

cancer (24). Therefore, this methodology will yield the causal
and temporal relationships between speciﬁc genotypic aberrations acquired during multistage carcinogenesis and the
resulting lung cancer phenotype. For instance, our results
suggest that mutations affecting p53 arise later than those in
Lkb1 or p16 silencing in K-RasG12V–driven NSCLC. Interestingly, unlike the originating primary tumor models, the serial
transplantation of both K-RasG12V and EML4-ALK implants
results in the acquisition of metastatic potential. Thus, this
approach offers an invaluable platform to potentially characterize the metastatic dissemination process in vivo as well
as the mutations, gene expression variations, or epigenetic
changes responsible for the acquisition of the invasive
capacity.
Likewise, the orthoallobank is a versatile and rapid platform
for the preclinical assessment of therapeutic regimes including
those dealing with the appearance of resistance mechanisms.
K-RasG12V- and EML4-ALK–driven implants respond to chemotherapy and crizotinib, respectively, and display histopathologic features that could facilitate the understanding of the
clinical outcome in patients subjected to similar regimes.
While this response is comparable to that observed in primary
murine tumors (20, 25), the orthotopic approach is substantially faster, reproducible, and homogenous, thus resulting in a

more reliable and straightforward alternative. Furthermore,
selected tumors from the archived orthoallobank that carry
particular sets of co-driver mutations could be treated simultaneously to assess potential differences in the therapeutic
response that may depend on, or be inﬂuenced by, a particular
genetic composition. Also, proteomic proﬁling of plasma
samples could potentially be applied for the identiﬁcation of
predictive biomarkers of treatment efﬁcacy (26).
In sum, we show a new systematic approach to study the
evolution of cancer that provides a powerful strategy not only
to tease out the molecular events that stimulate NSCLC
progression but also to identify novel therapeutic strategies
to ﬁght this devastating disease.
