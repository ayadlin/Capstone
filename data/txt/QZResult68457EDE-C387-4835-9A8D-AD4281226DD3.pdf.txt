ABSTRACT
Glucose is considered the primary energy source for all cells, and some cancers
are addicted to glucose. Here, we investigated the functional consequences of chronic
glucose deprivation in serous ovarian cancer cells. We found that cells resistant to
glucose starvation (glucose-restricted cells) demonstrated increased metabolic plasticity
that was dependent on NNMT (Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase) expression. We
further show that ZEB1 induced NNMT, rendered cells resistant to glucose deprivation
and recapitulated metabolic adaptations and mesenchymal gene expression observed
in glucose-restricted cells. NNMT depletion reversed metabolic plasticity in glucoserestricted cells and prevented de novo formation of glucose-restricted colonies. In
addition to its role in glucose independence, we found that NNMT was required for other
ZEB1-induced phenotypes, such as increased migration. NNMT protein levels were also
elevated in metastatic and recurrent tumors compared to matched primary carcinomas,
while normal ovary and fallopian tube tissue had no detectable NNMT expression. Our
studies define a novel ZEB1/NNMT signaling axis, which elicits mesenchymal gene
expression, as well as phenotypic and metabolic plasticity in ovarian cancer cells upon
chronic glucose starvation. Understanding the causes of cancer cell plasticity is crucial
for the development of therapeutic strategies to counter intratumoral heterogeneity,
acquired drug resistance and recurrence in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC).

INTRODUCTION

are “PET”-negative tumors, suggesting that some cancers
have a low glucose uptake [8]. These tumors could be less
dependent on glycolysis (i.e. have a low glycolytic activity),
too small for detection, or unable to access the glucose
supply as a result of a poorly developed vasculature [8, 9].
Indeed, the intratumoral glucose concentrations in some
solid tumors, such as breast, colon and prostate cancers,
appear to be lower than in normal cells of the same tissue
sites [10]. Also, there are profound inter- and intratumoral
differences in the tumor vasculature [11–13] and poorly
vascularized regions of the tumor may have restricted
glucose access, causing a heterogeneous intratumoral
glucose distribution. This is partly due to the limited
distance to which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from

Cellular energy metabolism is one of the first
processes altered during neoplastic transformation and
its deregulation is one of the emerging hallmarks of
cancer [1, 2]. Rapidly proliferating cancer cells increase
glucose uptake and undergo aerobic glycolysis (“Warburg
effect” [1, 3, 4]) in order to meet their increased metabolic
demands for the biosynthesis of nucleolipids, lipids, amino
acids and NADPH [5]. This phenomenon can be visualized
by positron emission tomography (PET), which utilizes
glucose analogs as reporters [6]. PET imaging is currently
an indispensable tool in diagnostic oncology for monitoring
neoplastic transformation in patients [7]. Interestingly, there

tumor blood vessels [14]. Cells residing in close proximity
to blood vessels are highly oxygenated and well-nourished
(glucose levels >>2.5 mM), while those residing farther
away are hypoxic and have low glucose levels (< 2.5 mM)
[14]. Furthermore, a study of invasive ovarian carcinomas
showed that tumor cell-lined vasculature was present only
in 30% of tumors (23 out of 77 patients) [15], suggesting
that up to two thirds of all ovarian cancers may have
regions with underdeveloped vasculature. In addition, the
use of anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, which
was recently FDA-approved for recurrent high-grade serous
ovarian cancer (HGSC), impairs tumor vasculature [16–21].
Since the main role of bevacizumab is to deprive the tumor
of its blood supply in order to induce cancer cell starvation
and apoptosis, bevacizumab-treated cancers are exposed
to nutritional stress, such as glucose deprivation. Taken
together, these data suggest that some regions of advanced
solid tumors, including HGSC, are deprived of glucose.
Cancers forced to adapt to a nutrient-deprived environment
may select for highly metabolically plastic cells or rewire
their metabolism in order to survive. Thus, it is crucial to
understand the consequences of adaptation to nutritional
stress as they may substantially influence ovarian cancer
phenotype during cancer expansion or following antiangiogenic therapy. A better understanding of metabolic
events influencing tumor behavior may inform the design
and outcome of novel treatment strategies. To date, a study
on phenotypic consequences of chronic glucose withdrawal
on ovarian cancer cells has not been performed.
Previous studies have focused on the effects of
acute glucose deprivation on signaling pathways that
govern cellular survival or death upon glucose withdrawal
[22–24]. Short-term glucose starvation in ovarian cancer
cells was shown to upregulate SLC2A1 and G6PD mRNA
and protein levels [25]. SLC2A1 (GLUT1) is a constitutive,
high affinity glucose transporter with additional substrate
specificity for transporting various pentoses and hexoses
[26, 27]. G6PD (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) is
a rate-limiting enzyme of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway
(PPP), whose main function is to generate reducing agents
(NADPH) and pentose phosphates for nucleic acids and
lipid synthesis [28–30]. Pasto et al. also showed that glucose
deprivation enriched for CD44+ CD117+ ovarian cancer
cells with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics,
which exhibit higher oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
and PPP activity [25]. However, little is known about the
phenotypic consequences of chronic glucose deprivation in
cells that survive the initial shock of glucose withdrawal.
Here, we sought to uncover the genetic, transcriptional
and metabolic adaptations in serous epithelial ovarian
cancer cells in response to chronic glucose starvation.
We found that resistance to glucose deprivation correlates
with increased expression of specific metabolic genes that
include G6PD, SLC2A1, as well as NNMT (Nicotinamide
N-methyltransferase), the function of which in this context
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was previously unknown. Our studies reveal that NNMT
is required for glucose independence and enables glucosedeprived cells to utilize a number of alternative substrates
as energy sources in the absence of sufficient glucose
levels. We further show that NNMT is induced as part of
a ZEB1-mediated mesenchymal gene expression program,
which determines the metabolic and phenotypic plasticity
in glucose-restricted cells. While ZEB1 is a known inducer
of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we find
that EMT is not required for glucose independence. Rather,
our data suggest that NNMT requirement in glucoserestricted cells selects for ZEB1 expression, which may in
turn result in partial or full EMT and thus enhance cancer
cell plasticity. Therefore, nutritional stress may contribute
to intratumoral heterogeneity, a hallmark feature of HGSC
that is considered to play a role in its high rate of recurrence
and poor overall survival [31–35].

RESULTS
Glucose deprivation induces NNMT expression
In order to assess the impact of glucose deprivation
in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines, we serially cultured
OVCAR3 cells in DMEM without added glucose. Due
to trace amounts of glucose in fetal bovine serum (FBS),
cells cultured in glucose-free DMEM with 10% FBS are
exposed to extremely low levels of glucose (~0.125 g/l ≈
0.69 mM), similar to glucose levels observed in hypoxic
and necrotic regions of solid cancers (< 2.5 mM) [14]
(Figure 1A). Control cells were continuously passaged
in regular DMEM containing 4.5 g/l glucose (25 mM,
hereafter referred to as high glucose levels). After eight
months, three independently derived glucose-restricted
populations of cells (OVCAR3 Gluc-1–3 sublines) were
compared to control cells in the presence of high and
low glucose levels. In regular seeding density conditions
in high glucose DMEM, glucose-restricted OVCAR3
sublines proliferated at similar rates as control cells;
however, proliferation of control cells was drastically
diminished in low glucose conditions, in which glucoserestricted cells were not affected (Figure 1B). During
prolonged (18 d) culturing in low density conditions,
glucose-restricted OVCAR3 sublines maintained their
capacity to proliferate and form viable colonies, whereas
viability of control cells was drastically impaired.
Specifically, the number of viable Gluc-3 cells was
virtually indistinguishable between high and low glucose
conditions, while the number of viable control cells
was reduced at least two-fold in low glucose DMEM
(Figure 1C). This more stringent assay also revealed
phenotypic differences between the three sublines,
where the OVCAR3 Gluc-1 subline had an intermediate
phenotype between glucose deprivation-sensitive control
OVCAR3 cells and fully adapted to glucose withdrawal
OVCAR3 Gluc-3 cells (Figure 1C).

To determine genome-wide transcriptional changes
underlying glucose independence in OVCAR3 cells,
we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on glucoserestricted cells (OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3) and control
OVCAR3 cells (Supplementary Table 1). We have found
613 genes differentially expressed between both Gluc-2
and Gluc-3 sublines and control cells, out of which
243 genes were upregulated and 370 downregulated.
Expression of those genes was altered at least two-fold
in both sublines (P < 0.05, q < 0.2). We have identified
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, NNMT, as the most
upregulated gene in glucose-restricted OVCAR3 cells
(> 140-fold increase in both Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 in two
biological replicates, P = 0.002 for Gluc-2; P = 0.0004
for Gluc-3, Supplementary Table 1, Figure 1D). RNA
and protein levels of NNMT correlated with the extent
of adaptation to glucose deprivation, with no detectable
NNMT expression in control OVCAR3, mild induction
in OVCAR3 Gluc-1, and highest NNMT expression in
OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines (Figure 1D). This
expression pattern was confirmed by immunofluorescence
(IF), which detected robust NNMT protein staining in
OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells but not in control
OVCAR3 (Figure 1E). Staining intensity varied
considerably between individual glucose-restricted cells.
Since OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines demonstrated
the best adaptation to glucose starvation, we prioritized
Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells for further genomic and metabolic
profiling. Using array-based Comparative Genomic
Hybridization (aCGH) we found genomic copy number
gain of NNMT in both OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells
compared to control (Figure 1F). Additionally, several
other genomic regions showed copy number alterations in
glucose-restricted cells, including the chromosomal region
harboring G6PD gene (Figure 1F and Supplementary
Table 2). In line with a published study on ovarian cancer
stem cells that are more resistant to glucose deprivation
[25], glucose-restricted OVCAR3 cells induced G6PD
and SLC2A1 expression at the transcriptional level
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A). In
summary, we identified robust upregulation of the methyl
transferase gene, NNMT, in glucose-restricted ovarian
cancer cells, along with upregulation of genes that were
previously described in the context of glucose starvation,
such as G6PD and SLC2A1.

substrates that can potentially serve as energy sources
in low glucose levels (Figure 1G). Compared to control
OVCAR3 cells, the OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines
acquired distinct patterns of substrate utilization, with
the most striking differences seen in their utilization
of various sugars and methylated substrates, and with
reduced utilization of many amino acids (Figure 1G). We
prioritized substrates, which utilization was statistically
significant between glucose-restricted cells (OVCAR3
Gluc-2 and Gluc-3) and control cells (Figure 1G,
asterisks). We observed that in low glucose conditions,
OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells utilized other sugars,
such as D-fructose, D-arabinose, mannan, maltotriose and
dextrin more efficiently than control cells (Figure 1G),
which may be a result of elevated SLC2A1 expression
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A).
In addition, glucose-restricted cells also utilized adenosine
and D, L- lactic acid at significantly higher rates, both of
which were previously shown to feed metabolism via
gluconeogenesis or glycolysis [36, 37]. These results
suggest that glucose-restricted OVCAR3 sublines can
utilize other carbon sources to bypass the need for glucose.
In addition, D-glucose-6-phosphate, which is a
G6PD substrate, was utilized at much higher levels in
glucose-restricted OVCAR3 sublines compared to control
cells (on average > 20-fold, P = 0.055) (Figure 1G). Along
with upregulated G6PD expression, this result suggests
that glucose-independent cells elevate Pentose Phosphate
Pathway (PPP) activity, as previously described in glucose
deprivation-resistant ovarian cancer stem cells [25]. In
line with this study, we observed that glucose-restricted
OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines had increased
expression of ovarian cancer stem cell markers, such as
CD44 and CD117 [35], as well as decreased expression
of CA125 (MUC16) [38], an ovarian cancer marker
negatively correlated with stemness (Supplementary
Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1B).
Biolog Microarrays also showed that OVCAR3
Gluc sublines utilized more ketone bodies (acetoacetic
acid and D, L-β-hydroxy-butyric acid; all P < 0.05) than
control cells, suggesting that glucose-restricted sublines
may rely more on ketosis, the process in which ketone
bodies are used as a metabolic fuel. Interestingly, in
contrast to control cells, glucose-restricted OVCAR3
cells utilized methylated compounds, such as α-methylD-galactoside, α-methyl-D-glucoside and mono-methyl
succinate. Considering the role of NNMT in methylation
reactions, the use of these methylated substrates may be a
specific adaptation of glucose-restricted cells that may be
linked to NNMT expression.

Glucose-restricted OVCAR3 cells acquire
distinct metabolic adaptations
To determine if glucose-restricted ovarian cancer
cell lines rewire their metabolic pathways in order
to compensate for the lack of glucose, we analyzed
their ability to utilize alternative metabolites as energy
sources in the absence of glucose. For this purpose, we
used Biolog Phenotype Microarrays, in which wells are
individually coated with different carbon and nitrogen

of ovarian cancer cells by allowing them to efficiently
utilize alternative energy substrates, such as methylated
carbohydrates. We next proceeded to test this hypothesis
directly by depleting NNMT in glucose-restricted cells.

deprivation, we next analyzed glucose-restricted cells
generated from two additional epithelial ovarian cancer
cells lines, OVCAR4 and OAW28, both of which are
considered faithful representatives of HGSC [39].
Similarly to OVCAR3 Gluc cells, OVCAR4 and OAW28
Gluc sublines were unperturbed in low glucose conditions
unlike their control cells (Figure 2A). We observed that
NNMT expression was consistently elevated in all glucoserestricted OAW28 and OVCAR4 cells. In contrast,
expression of SLC2A1 and G6PD was increased in
glucose-restricted OAW28 cells but not in OVCAR4 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1A), suggesting that adaptation of
OVCAR4 cells to glucose withdrawal did not depend on
the upregulation of those targets. This could be explained
by the higher baseline expression level of those targets
in parental OVCAR4 cells, which in turn could mediate
greater intrinsic adaptability of this cell line to glucose
deprivation. Indeed, the comparison of parental OVCAR3,
OAW28 and OVCAR4 cells in low density seeding
conditions revealed that OVCAR4 cells had the highest
level of adaptation to glucose deprivation. Following low
density seeding in low glucose, the relative viability of
OVCAR4 cells after 18d was the highest among the three
cell lines and significantly higher than relative viability of
OVCAR3 or OAW28 cells (Figure 2B). This correlated
with higher RNA expression of NNMT and G6PD in
OVCAR4 cells compared to the two other cell lines
(Figure 2C). Contrary, SLC2A1 expression was highest in
OAW28 cells (Figure 2C) and correlated with the most
efficient utilization of sugars such as dextrin, D-fructose
and maltotriose in this cell line (Figure 2D). However,
utilization of methylated substrates, such as α-methylD-galactoside, α-methyl-D-glucoside and mono-methyl
succinate, was only observed in OVCAR4 cells with high
endogenous expression of NNMT. Thus, comparison of
endogenous NNMT expression with the level of adaptation
to glucose deprivation in parental cell lines supports the

NNMT knockdown reverses glucose
independence
To test if NNMT is required for the metabolic
adaptations in glucose-restricted cells, we used shRNA
delivered via lentivirus to deplete NNMT in the glucoserestricted sublines OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3
(Figure 3A). We tested three individual shRNAs targeting
NNMT and chose two (shNNMT-1 and shNNMT-3)
and a non-targeting control shRNA (shCtrl) for further
experiments. Depletion of NNMT reversed proliferative
capacity of OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines but had
no effect on the proliferation of control OVCAR3 cells over
the 5-day long culture in low glucose DMEM at normal
seeding density conditions (Figure 3B). NNMT depletion
also reduced viability of glucose-restricted cells seeded
at low-density in low glucose conditions (Figure 3C).
Interestingly, viability of control OVCAR3 shNNMT cells
was also reduced compared to control OVCAR3 shCtrl
cells (Figure 3C) after long term culture (5 weeks) in low
glucose conditions, suggesting that suppressing NNMT
induction during prolonged glucose deprivation prevents
adaptation to low glucose conditions. In order to assess
if the reversal of glucose independence is accompanied
by changes in the utilization of alternative substrates, we
subjected NNMT-depleted OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3
cells to Biolog Phenotype Microarray analysis (Figure 3D).
Here we found that utilization of methylated carbohydrates,
such as α-methyl-D-galactoside and its isoform, β-methylD-galactoside, was significantly decreased in shNNMT
cells compared to shCtrl (Figure 3E). Together with our

(A) Cells were seeded at low density and allowed to expand for 18d in DMEM with low glucose (black bars) or in high glucose (blue
bars). Using crystal violet staining we show that relative number of viable glucose-restricted OAW28 and OVCAR4 cells is similar in
DMEM with low and high glucose levels, whereas viability of control cells is impaired upon glucose withdrawal. Graphs in the lower panel
depict transcriptional changes in OAW28 and OVCAR4 glucose-restricted sublines determined by qRT-PCR. NNMT mRNA expression is
consistently upregulated in all glucose-restricted sublines generated from OVCAR4 and OAW28 cell lines. NNMT mRNA levels remain
largely unaffected upon 7 d-long release of glucose-restricted sublines (black bars) to high glucose DMEM (H). Similarly, 2 d-long culture
of control cells (red bars) in low glucose DMEM (L) does not induce NNMT mRNA levels. (B) Parental OVCAR4 cells have a superior
ability to expand in low density seeding conditions in low glucose levels, as manifested by the higher total number of viable cells in low
glucose DMEM (black bars) compared to OAW28 and OVCAR3 cells. OAW28 cells have an intermediate phenotype. All cell lines were
cultured for 18 d and treatment in low glucose levels was normalized to treatment in high glucose levels (blue bars) for the same cell line
to account for the intrinsically different proliferation rates of all tested cell lines. Scale bar: 5 mm. (C) NNMT and G6PD mRNA expression
is higher in parental OVCAR4 cells compared to OVCAR3 and OAW28 cell lines. Expression of SLC2A1 (GLUT1) is highest in parental
OAW28 cells. (D) Biolog Microarray results show that parental OVCAR4 cells utilize methylated substrates more efficiently than parental
OVCAR3 cells. Parental OAW28 cells have an intermediate phenotype. Substrates differentially utilized between the given cell line and

observation that these substrates are only metabolized in
NNMT-expressing OVCAR4 cells and glucose-restricted
OVCAR3 cells, but not control OVCAR3, these results
suggest that NNMT is required for the utilization of
α-methyl-D-galactoside and other methylated substrates,
thus establishing a new role for NNMT in metabolic
plasticity required for survival of glucose starvation.
This conclusion was further supported by results
from NNMT-null cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9
(Supplementary Figure 2A). While CRISPR/Cas9mediated knockout of NNMT did not yield viable colonies
in OVCAR3 or its sublines (data not shown), we were able
to generate NNMT-null OVCAR4 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2A). Loss of NNMT expression completely
abolished OVCAR4 growth in low glucose medium upon
culturing in low seeding density conditions for 14 days.
Similarly, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to deplete NNMT in
SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells (endometrioid/clear cell
subtype [40]), a cell line previously shown to have high
NNMT activity [41]. As expected, NNMT depletion in
SKOV3 cells resulted in greatly diminished ability of this
cell line to grow in low glucose medium (Supplementary
Figure 2A). In summary, these results suggest that NNMT
is required for glucose independence in ovarian cancer
cell lines and supports cell survival in glucose-deprived
environment by facilitating metabolic adaptations.

compared them to parental control cells (Figure 4E).
Only ZEB1 robustly induced NNMT expression and
transcriptional changes reminiscent of EMT, such as
loss of E-cadherin and claudins (CLDN4, CLDN7), and
induction of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin,
vimentin, SPARC and MMP2 (Figure 4E and 4F).
Interestingly, ectopic ZEB1 expression had no effect on the
expression of G6PD and SLC2A1 (Figure 4F), suggesting
that upregulation of those targets in glucose-restricted
cells is ZEB1-independent. Ectopic ZEB1 expression in
OVCAR4 cells induced similar transcriptional changes
(Supplementary Figure 3B and 3C). However, relative
upregulation of NNMT was less prominent in OVCAR4ZEB1 cells, consistent with higher baseline expression of
NNMT in OVCAR4 compared to OVCAR3 cells.
Next, we tested if ZEB1 overexpression can
recapitulate the metabolic adaptations seen in glucoserestricted cells. To this end, we compared parental
OVCAR3 cells and OVCAR3-ZEB1 cells using Biolog
Phenotype Microarrays (Figure 4G). Indeed, OVCAR3ZEB1 cells were able to more efficiently utilize methylated
substrates, such as α-methyl-D-galactoside and monomethyl succinate, as well as some additional carbohydrates
previously correlated with glucose-independence, such
as maltotriose (Figure 4G). We validated these results
by overexpressing ZEB1 in another ovarian cancer cell
line of serous histology (OVCA433), which shows no
detectable endogenous expression of NNMT or ZEB1
(Supplementary Figure 4B [45]). OVCA433-ZEB1
cells express NNMT and other mesenchymal markers
(Supplementary Figure 4B) and proliferate at higher rates
in low glucose conditions relative to OVCA433-GFP
control cells (Supplementary Figure 4C). Biolog analysis
revealed that utilization of methylated substrates was
also increased in OVCA433-ZEB1 cells (Supplementary
Figure 4D). We conclude that ectopic ZEB1 expression is
sufficient to upregulate NNMT and other mesenchymal
genes, enable cells to use methylated substrates as
an alternative energy sources, and induce glucose
independence in glucose-dependent epithelial ovarian
cancer cell lines.

ZEB1 is an upstream regulator of NNMT and
mediator of glucose independence
Since NNMT expression is absent in both OVCAR3
and OAW28 epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines but
highly induced in glucose-restricted sublines, we next
sought to determine the upstream mechanisms controlling
NNMT expression. RNAseq analysis in OVCAR3
(Supplementary Table 1) and subsequent qRT-PCR
validation of individual candidate genes in all glucoserestricted cell lines and controls revealed consistent
upregulation of ZEB1, MMP2, SPARC and CTGF in
glucose-restricted sublines (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Figure 3A). These genes are associated with epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) and indeed, we found the
highest NNMT expression in the mesenchymal subtype of
HGSC [32, 33] (Figure 4B). In our panel of ovarian cancer
cell lines, NNMT protein expression positively correlated
with expression of ZEB1 and other mesenchymal markers,
such as vimentin (Figure 4C). Also, all ovarian cancer
cell lines with high ZEB1 expression were positive for
NNMT (Figure 4C and 4D). However, some cell lines with
epithelial morphology (positive for E-cadherin, negative
for vimentin and ZEB1, e.g. CAOV3 and OV90) were still
positive for NNMT (Figure 4C and 4D), suggesting that
ZEB1-independent mechanism can also induce NNMT. To
test directly if ZEB1 mediates some of the transcriptional
changes observed in glucose-restricted cells, we
overexpressed ZEB1 and SLUG in OVCAR3 cells and

Glucose deprivation creates phenotypic
heterogeneity
ZEB1 is a potent inducer of EMT [46–48] and
overexpression of ZEB1 induced EMT in epithelial
OVCAR3 cells, as determined by loss of E-cadherin
protein expression and induction of mesenchymal
markers, such as vimentin and N-cadherin (Figure 4E).
OVCAR3-ZEB1 cells also had increased migratory
potential, as demonstrated by Boyden chamber migration
assays (Supplementary Figure 4A). Therefore, we
considered the possibility that EMT may be a consequence
of glucose deprivation. Indeed, loss of E-cadherin and
induction of N-cadherin and vimentin was observed in

calculations were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (* 0.001 < P <0.05; **P < 0.001).

OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines (Figure 5A). In
addition, both sublines lost expression of genes involved
in maintaining cell-cell junctions, such as PKP3, CLDN4,
CLDN7 (Supplementary Figure 5A), EPCAM, CDH1 and
OCLN (Supplementary Table 1). As a result, OVCAR3
Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells lost cell-cell interactions and
grew as loosely connected cell populations, in contrast
to control OVCAR3 that formed tightly linked patches
of cells (Figure 5B). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis
of RNAseq results for these cell lines also revealed
activation of several processes associated with EMT
[49, 50], such as cell migration, anti-apoptotic signaling
and vasculature development (Supplementary Table 3).
In contrast, downregulated cellular functions included
positive regulation of mitosis, epithelium development
and cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis revealed that the transcriptional changes
observed in OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells were
enriched for both an EMT signature gene set and genes,
which expression is downregulated in cancer cells upon
co-culture with activated stroma [51] (Supplementary
Table 4 and Supplementary Figure 5B). This data supports
the hypothesis that OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 undergo
EMT, similar to what has been shown for another form of
metabolic stress, hypoxia [52–55].
However, the OVCAR3 Gluc-1 subline, which
had an intermediate metabolic phenotype (i.e. was less
proliferative in low glucose DMEM and had lower NNMT
levels), did not undergo full EMT. While OVCAR3
Gluc-1 cells became positive for N-cadherin, they
remained negative for vimentin and retained expression
of E-cadherin (Figure 5A), as well as PKP3, CLDN4 and
CLDN7 (Supplementary Figure 5A). Also, OVCAR3
Gluc-1 cells morphologically resembled control OVCAR3
(Figure 5B). Taken together, these data suggested that
EMT may be a consequence but not a prerequisite of
glucose independence. Analysis of the additional glucoserestricted cell lines confirmed this observation: western
blot and qRT-PCR analysis of the glucose-restricted
OVCAR4 sublines revealed loss of E-cadherin, claudins
(CLDN4, CLDN7) and plakophilin (PKP3), but in
addition, loss of N-cadherin and vimentin in two out of
three sublines (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 5A).
In OAW28, we detected virtually no changes in classic
EMT-associated gene expression: E-cadherin and vimentin
protein levels were similar in glucose-restricted sublines
and control cells (Figure 5A), and RNA expression
of CLDN4, CLDN7 and PKP3 remained unchanged
or were elevated in some sublines (Supplementary
Figure 5A). We next assessed migratory potential in all
glucose-restricted cell lines as a functional property
associated with EMT (Figure 5C). Two out of three
OVCAR3 sublines (OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3) and
one out of three OVCAR4 sublines (OVCAR4 Gluc-1)
became more migratory, while the remaining glucoserestricted sublines, including all OAW28 sublines, did not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 5C). Thus, we conclude that EMT is not required
for glucose independence, but glucose independence may
be associated with transcriptional and functional changes
indicative of EMT, depending on the level of ZEB1
induction. Furthermore, glucose independence generates
phenotypic heterogeneity, resulting in populations with
various degrees of mesenchymal properties.

NNMT maintains the mesenchymal-like
phenotype associated with glucose independence
Since NNMT has been reported as a metabolic
mesenchymal signature gene [56] with potential roles in
migration [57] and aggressive tumor behavior [58, 59],
we next asked if in addition to its requirement for glucose
independence, NNMT also plays a role in maintaining
mesenchymal-like features in glucose-restricted cells. We
found that NNMT depletion elevated expression of CLDN4
and CLDN7 (Figure 5D), as well as partially rescued the
loss of cell–cell interactions in OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and
Gluc-3 cells (Figure 5E). In addition, NNMT depletion
significantly decreased the migratory potential of OVCAR3
Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells compared to shCtrl (Figure 5F),
while it had no effect in epithelial OVCAR3 controls.
We then considered the possibility that glucose
independence may be associated with a mesenchymal gene
signature that is different from the classic EMT signature.
To address this possibility, we compared significantly
upregulated genes in OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells
(Supplementary Table 1) with published signatures of
the mesenchymal (or desmoplastic) subtype of HGSC
[32, 33] (Figure 5G and Supplementary Table 5). Among
the 16 genes common to these signatures, NNMT, LOXL2,
SPARC, MMP2, TAGLN, ACTA2 and CTGF, are known
mesenchymal regulators and were commonly upregulated
in all glucose-restricted sublines (Supplementary
Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 5A), suggesting
that mesenchymal gene signature associated with glucose
independence may be expressed in E-cadherin positive,
vimentin-negative cells. Interestingly, the high baseline
expression level of some of these genes in parental
OVCAR4 cells (Supplementary Figure 5C) correlates
with their resistance to glucose deprivation compared
to other epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines, such as
OVCAR3 and OAW28. Of note, array-CGH (Figure 1F)
revealed DNA copy number gains for LOXL2, TAGLN
and MMP2 in glucose-restricted OVCAR3 cells, implying
that these genomic events may further contribute to the
transcriptional changes observed in glucose-restricted cells.

NNMT is expressed in human HGSC
Finally, we sought to assess NNMT protein levels
in human HGSC. Analysis of published datasets revealed
that NNMT expression is highest in the mesenchymal
subtype of ovarian cancer (Figure 4B), which some

glucose independence. While some glucose-restricted cells acquire a mesenchymal-like phenotype, as manifested by the loss of E-cadherin
and gain of Vimentin and N-cadherin expression (OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3), other sublines assume epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid

DISCUSSION

studies have associated with the worst overall survival
[32, 33]. In line with this, our survival analysis of over
922 publicly available HGSC [60] showed that NNMT
expression is negatively correlated with both overall
and progression-free survival (Supplementary Figure
6A and 6B) in HGSC patients (stage III and IV). Also,
a broad comparison of NNMT expression levels in
tumors of various origin (red bars) and corresponding
normal control tissues (green bars) showed a general
trend toward higher NNMT expression in cancer than in
normal tissue (Supplementary Figure 6C). Specifically,
carcinomas of ovary, cervix, vulva and vagina, all showed
significantly upregulated NNMT expression compared to
healthy tissues.
Taken together, these in silico results prompted us
to assess NNMT protein expression in primary, metastatic
and recurrent ovarian carcinomas. For this purpose, we
performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NNMT
on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 35 triplets of
matched primary, recurrent and metastatic HGSC. Our
results show that NNMT protein expression is detectable
both in the carcinoma and adjacent stroma (Figure
6A–6D), with NNMT expression in some specimens
exclusively present only in one of the compartments
(Figure 6A and 6C). Furthermore, elevated NNMT was
often detected in close proximity to the necrotic tissue
sites (Figure 6D). Of note, normal ovary and fallopian
tube epithelium or stroma had no detectable NNMT
levels (Figure 6E). Also, NNMT was expressed in 54%
of primary (n = 19 positive versus n  = 16 negative),
63% metastatic (n = 22 positive versus n = 13 negative)
and 57% recurrent carcinomas (n  = 20 positive versus
n = 15 negative) (Figure 6F). Detailed analyses of
intratumoral differences in NNMT expression between
primary, recurrent and metastatic specimens demonstrate
that NNMT expression was specifically elevated in
metastatic biopsies compared to corresponding primary
carcinoma sites (n = 18 expressed NNMT higher than
matched primary, n = 9 had the same expression, n = 8
had lower expression) (Figure 6G). In recurrent biopsies,
most of the patients showed higher (n = 13) or the same
(n = 13) NNMT protein level, whereas only 9 patients
had decreased NNMT expression compared to matched
primary carcinoma. Interestingly, NNMT levels in the
stroma compartment were consistently upregulated both
in the metastatic (n = 28 expressed NNMT higher than
matched primary, n = 2 had the same expression, n = 5
had lower expression) and recurrent biopsies (n  = 23
expressed NNMT higher than matched primary, n = 5
had the same expression, n = 7 had lower expression)
compared to primary carcinomas. In summary, we found
that more than half of all primary HGSC contained
NNMT-positive regions. Moreover, NNMT was further
induced in metastatic and recurrent HGSC compared to
their matched primary tumors.

Metabolic adaptations in glucose-restricted
ovarian cancer cells
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) ranks
among the five deadliest cancers in women and is the
second most common gynecological cancer. It remains a
burden for women worldwide and its low 5-year survival
rate (~40%) has not improved significantly in the past
40 years. This is partly due to complex molecular and
phenotypic disease heterogeneity and inherent drug
resistance. Specifically, the mesenchymal subtype of
HGSC correlates with the poorest overall survival [33, 61]
and extensive desmoplastic stromal reaction. Furthermore,
the transition to mesenchymal-like subtype was observed
in chemoresistant HGSC [62]. We hypothesized that
metabolic alterations in the tumor microenvironment,
such as glucose starvation, may have direct phenotypic
consequences on ovarian cancer evolution. Glucose
deprivation is frequently observed in advanced human
malignancies, such as HGSC [15], as a result of intrinsic
intratumoral heterogeneity in the vasculature development
or following anti-angiogenic treatment [18–21]. Such
nutritional stress may select for highly metabolically
plastic cells and alter the molecular subtype of cancer cells
surviving the initial shock of glucose deprivation. This
prompted us to investigate mechanisms and consequences of
adaptation to chronic low glucose levels in epithelial ovarian
cancer cell lines. We identified the methyl transferase NNMT
as a novel regulator of metabolic plasticity in cells adapted
to low glucose levels. Our results suggest that NNMT
plays a crucial role in adaptation to glucose deprivation, in
addition to the glucose transporter, SLC2A1 (GLUT1), and
the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD,
which were previously described in the context of glucose
independence [25, 63] and confirmed in our studies.
In line with increased SLC2A1 expression, we
observed that glucose-restricted cells can utilize other
sugars, such as D-fructose, D-arabinose, mannan,
maltotriose and dextrin more efficiently than control
cells. We also observed increased use of ketone bodies
(acetoacetic acid and D, L-β-hydroxy-butyric acid) in
glucose-restricted cells. Ketone bodies together with
lactic acid can fuel the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA
cycle) and produce NADH and FADH2. These molecules
feed oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to produce
ATP. Thus, ketosis may represent an alternative way to
produce energy by glucose-restricted sublines. However,
as a consequence of elevated OXPHOS activity, levels
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) rise [64], which need
to be offset by PPP activity. The main function of PPP is
the production of reducing agents and pentose phosphates
for nucleic acid and lipid synthesis [28–30], and G6PD
is a rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, which generates

carcinomas shows a heterogeneous expression pattern. In individual HGSC specimens, NNMT protein was detected either in tumor
compartment; (B) both in tumor and adjacent stroma; (C) exclusively in cancer stroma; and (D) frequently next to necrotic tumor regions.
(E) NNMT expression was undetectable in normal ovary (top) and fallopian tube epithelium (Epi) and stroma (Str) (bottom). (F) NNMT
immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray consisting of patient-matched primary, recurrent and metastatic specimens demonstrates that
most of the ovarian cancer specimens, which express NNMT in the tumor compartment, also have detectable NNMT protein in the stroma.
However, many specimens show high NNMT levels only in cancer stroma. Also, a significant portion of primary carcinomas demonstrate
non-detectable NNMT expression both in stroma and tumor, while all metastatic specimens express NNMT in stroma. (G) In most of the
analyzed patients NNMT protein expression in stroma is significantly elevated in metastatic and recurrent biopsies compared to patientmatched primary carcinomas. However, NNMT levels in the carcinoma compartment are elevated only in metastases compared to matched
primary specimens, but not in recurrent biopsies. Scale bar: 50 µm.

NNMT expression, such as SKOV3 and OVCAR4, caused a
drastic decrease in their viability in low glucose conditions.

NADPH required to reduce oxidized glutathione (GSSG)
to reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is required for the
reduction of ROS and the maintenance of the normal redox
state [64]. Thus, elevated expression of G6PD may help
glucose-deprived cells survive oxidative stress and rewire
the metabolism. Of note, elevated expression of SLC2A1
and G6PD, as well as increased PPP and OXPHOS activity,
have recently been linked with resistance of putative ovarian
cancer stem cells to glucose deprivation [25]. Consistent
with this study, we observed that glucose-restricted cells
exhibit increased expression of ovarian cancer stem cell
markers, such as CD117 (KIT [35] and CD44 [35], as well
as decreased expression of CA125 (MUC16) [38].
Both G6PD and NNMT are subject to DNA copy
number gains and transcriptional upregulation in glucoserestricted cells, suggesting that they play non-overlapping
functions in glucose independence. NNMT methylates
nicotinamide using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a
methyl donor, thereby creating the stable metabolite,
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and reducing the amount
of methyl groups available for cellular methylation
reactions [41, 42]. As a result, NNMT plays a fundamental
role in regulating cellular methylation potential and its
elevated expression may induce epigenetic remodeling
of cells by altering histone methylation status [41, 65].
We found that NNMT was required for the utilization of
methylated substrates, such as α-methyl-D-galactoside,
α-methyl-D-glucoside and mono-methyl succinate, as
alternative sources of energy in glucose-restricted cells.
These substrates were poorly utilized in NNMT-low
expressing epithelial ovarian cancer cells, suggesting
that NNMT-deprived cells may not be able to efficiently
metabolize these methylated compounds in the absence
of glucose. Considering the role of NNMT in methylation
reactions, it is plausible that some of those substrates
could serve as potential methyl donors for NNMTmediated enzymatic reactions. In line with this, NNMT
depletion significantly decreased the ability of glucoserestricted sublines to utilize α-methyl-D-galactoside
and its isoform, β-methyl-D-galactoside. However,
little is known about the biochemistry of methylated
carbohydrates and further studies are needed to determine
if and how these compounds are able to fuel metabolic
pathways.
Recent studies also classified NNMT as a
Mesenchymal Metabolic Signature Gene, commonly
expressed at a high level in the human mesenchymallike cancer cells (n = 978) [56]. Our data also show that
NNMT expression is highest in the mesenchymal subtype
of ovarian cancer. Previous studies also showed that NNMT
expression is elevated in “aggressive” cancer cell lines [41]
and NNMT has a role in regulation of cellular migration
[41, 57, 66]. In line with these results, NNMT knockdown
decreased proliferative and migratory properties of glucoserestricted OVCAR3 sublines. In addition, NNMT depletion
in parental ovarian cancer cell lines with high baseline

ZEB1-mediated induction of NNMT links
metabolic stress to mesenchymal gene expression
We found that chronic glucose deprivation in several
epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines induces mesenchymal
gene expression. Although we found that some glucoserestricted cells lose cell-cell interactions and become more
migratory, the extent of mesenchymal transformation in
response to glucose deprivation was variable and most
glucose-restricted ovarian cancer sublines retained their
epithelial morphology. In fact, we observed considerable
phenotypic heterogeneity in the epithelial/mesenchymal
status of glucose-restricted sublines generated from the
same cell line. Therefore, we conclude that full EMT
is not a prerequisite for survival of prolonged glucose
deprivation. Instead, we identified a set of mesenchymal
genes such as MMP2, SPARC, CTGF and NNMT, that
were consistently upregulated in glucose-restricted cells
and shared with the mesenchymal subtype of HGSC
described by Tothill et al. [33] and TCGA [32]. This
set of mesenchymal genes was associated with glucose
independence even when classic epithelial markers, such
as E-cadherin, were retained. Furthermore, ZEB1 was
consistently upregulated in all glucose-restricted sublines
and its ectopic expression partially recapitulated glucose
independence and mesenchymal-like gene expression
observed in Gluc cells, in particular elevated MMP2,
SPARC, and NNMT expression. However, ZEB1 did
not upregulate expression of these genes to the level
observed in glucose-restricted cells (2-40-fold change
by ZEB1 overexpression in OVCAR3 compared to 20200-fold change in glucose-restricted OVCAR3 sublines),
suggesting that additional transcriptional regulators
contribute to mesenchymal-like gene expression in
glucose-restricted cells. Furthermore, ZEB1 did not
alter expression of G6PD and SLC2A1, which supports
the notion that these metabolic genes are regulated by
independent mechanisms. Thus, whether or not EMT
occurs in glucose-restricted cells appears to be dependent
on the level of ZEB1 induction, as well as the activation
status of alternative pathways contributing to glucose
independence. For example, high endogenous expression
of the glucose transporter SLC2A1 in OAW28 cells may
reduce the requirement for ZEB1 and NNMT, and indeed,
the level of upregulation of those targets was moderate in
glucose-restricted OAW28 cells compared to their drastic
induction in glucose-restricted OVCAR3 cells.
Genomic events also seem to contribute to
mesenchymal-like gene expression changes in glucoserestricted cells. Some of the most significantly upregulated
genes, such as NNMT, MMP2, LOXL2, and TAGLN,
gained one or more DNA copies in the process of acquired
glucose independence. Thus, nutritional stress may
26213

Oncotarget

select for transcriptional and genomic events in ovarian
cancer cells to elicit mesenchymal-like gene expression
changes. Of note, glucose-restricted sublines have
comparable passage number to control cells, which were
simultaneously passaged throughout the eight-monthperiod and show the same proliferation rate in glucosecontaining medium as glucose-restricted cells in low
glucose medium (Figure 1B). Thus, the difference in the
number of population doublings could not account for the
observed genomic instability or metabolic alterations.
In addition, our data show that NNMT may play a
crucial role in ovarian cancer progression or metastases
since its expression both in tumor and stroma compartment
is significantly increased in metastatic and recurrent
carcinomas compared to patient-matched primary tumor
specimens. Consistently with our results, studies by
Bignotti et al. [67] and Brodsky et al. [68] identified
NNMT as a part of a signature of significantly upregulated
genes in omental metastasis compared to primary HGSC.
In summary, our results suggest that the ZEB1/
NNMT signaling axis induces phenotypic and metabolic
plasticity, as well as mesenchymal gene expression in
ovarian cancer cells upon chronic glucose deprivation.
Since heterogeneity of tumor vasculature is a common
feature of advanced malignancies, it is plausible that
individual ovarian cancers, irrespective of their expression
subtype, may acquire regions of highly metabolically
plastic, mesenchymal-like cancer cells due to exposure
to nutritional stress. These cells may then contribute to
metastasis and recurrence. Of note, one of the mechanisms
of acquired bevacizumab resistance in glioblastoma [16]
and in colorectal cancer cells [17] is EMT. While our
studies suggest that EMT is not a requirement for glucose
independence, it may represent a phenotypic outcome of
adaptation to nutritional stress as a direct consequence of
ZEB1 activity. Furthermore, results of our studies suggest
that NNMT is required for the resistance to glucose
deprivation and thus, bevacizumab treatment may select
for NNMT overexpressing cells. In fact, recent studies
showed that NNMT expression is significantly elevated
in tumors treated with bevacizumab and remains elevated
even upon removal of anti-angiogenic therapy [16]. Since
bevacizumab is now FDA-approved for HGSC, it will be
interesting to see, if NNMT indeed plays a role in drug
resistance in this context.

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with
110 mg/l sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 1% antibioticantimycotic (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and
2.5 µg/ml plasmocin (Invivogen). Since FBS contains
glucose in the concentration of about 1.25 g/l, the
final glucose level in media used by glucose-restricted
cells was around 0.125 g/l (0.69 mM). Control cells
were maintained for eight months in DMEM medium

washes, samples were blocked with 1% BSA solution
in PBS for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with primary
mouse anti-NNMT antibodies 1:200 (Santa Cruz) at 4ºC
overnight followed by the detection with goat anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at the 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at RT. Cells were
washed three times with PBS, counterstained with DAPI
and imaged using an inverted fluorescent IX51 microscope
(Olympus, Valley, PA).

Viability assays
To create growth curves, cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (1 × 103 per well) in DMEM medium with and
without glucose. Cells were harvested daily for six
consecutive days using a luminometric assay performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega, Madison,
WI). Luminescence was measured after 15 min incubation
with the luminescent substrate and scanned using Glomax
Multi Detection System (Promega). Relative viability
was calculated as described before [73]. Graphs were
generated using GraphPad Prism version 6 software (San
Diego, CA). Cell viability was also assessed by crystal
violet staining. For low seeding density conditions, cells
were seeded at the density 3 × 103 cells per 35 mm well
of a six-well plate and cultured for 2–5 wk in DMEM
medium with and without glucose. Cells were later
washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained
with 0.1% crystal violet. Quantitation was performed
by extracting the crystal violet dye with 10% acetic
acid and measuring the absorbance at 550 nm with the
Glomax Multi Detection System (Promega). At least two
independent experiments were performed in triplicate for
each cell line for all proliferation and viability assays. All
cells were harvested at ≤ 80% confluency.

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue Microarray (TMA) consisting of paraffin
embedded tissue sections were de-paraffinized and
rehydrated as follows: two incubations in xylene for 5 min
each, followed by three incubations in 100% ethanol for
3 min each with subsequent serial dilutions of ethanol
(95%, 70%, 50% and 20%) for 3 min each. After washing
with H2O, the TMA sections were treated with Antigen
Unmasking Solution (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and
then washed in PBS followed by treatment with 0.3%
H2O2 in methanol for 30 min. After washing with PBS,
TMA sections were blocked with normal goat serum for
20 min, and then incubated with primary mouse antiNNMT antibodies (Santa Cruz) at the 1:100 dilution for
30 min, washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated
secondary anti-mouse antibodies (Vector Labs) for 30 min.
Finally, the antigen-antibody complexes were detected
with the Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Labs), stained
with ImmPACT/DAB staining solution (Vector Labs)
for 30 min and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides
were dehydrated, air-dried and mounted with Permount
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). All patients provided written
informed consent for tissue storage and research use of
donated cancer sample.

Boyden chamber migration assay
Cells were trypsinized with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA
solution without glucose (Gibco), washed twice with PBS
and resuspended in DMEM without FBS supplemented
with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 2.5 µg/ml plasmocin.
5 × 104 cells were seeded in 100 µl DMEM without FBS
inside the 24-well Millicell Hanging Cell Culture PET
Insert of 8µm pore diameter (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
and allowed to settle for 30 minutes at 37°C. 650 µl
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (attractant) was then
added carefully to the well, outside of the insert. After a
24 h-long incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed
and stained with Diff-Quick Stain Set (Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). The inside of the insert was
cleaned with Q-tip cotton swabs to remove cells, which

Microarray-based comparative genomic
hybridization
Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Tissue Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen).
Infinium CytoSNP-850k Beadchip array (Illumina, Essex,
UK) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocols
26215

Oncotarget

to determine genome-wide copy number changes in
OVCAR3 control, Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 cells. CytoSNP850K BeadChip oligonucleotide arrays (Illumina) contains
approximately 850,000 probes (50-mer long) with enriched
coverage for 3262 genes of known relevance in cancer
applications. Arrays were imaged using Illumina iScan
and copy number values were determined by the Illumina
BeadStudio software. All copy number calls are provided
in Supplementary Table 2 (0: deletion/no call, 1: 1 copy,
2: 2 copies, 3: 3 copies (genomic gain), 4: 4+ copies
(amplification)). Raw data files are available upon request.

and then corrected for multiple hypotheses by calculating
the q value using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.
Data from well-annotated genes that had significant gene
expression differences with a false discovery rate below
20% (defined as a q value < 0.2) are presented.

Biolog phenotype microarrays
Metabolic profiling was performed with Biolog
Phenotype Microarrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA)
according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly,
cells were seeded in PM-M1 and PM-M2 96-well
plates. The PM-M1 array consists of wells coated with
carbohydrate and carboxylate substrates, whereas PMM2 contains glutamine, individual L-amino acids and
most dipeptide combinations. Cell lines were seeded
into Biolog Microarray wells and cultured at 37°C, 5%
CO2 in a humidified atmosphere and in Biolog IF-M1
proprietary medium without glucose, but with low levels
of glutamine (0.3 mM), 5% FBS and 1% Penicillin/
Streptomycin solution. The assays were incubated
for 48 h and the colorimetric reaction was developed
with MB dye for 6 h. Color intensity reflects the level
of energy produced by cells as a measure of NAD+
reduction to NADH. Absorbance for all substrates was
measured at 600 nm using Glomax Multi Detection
System (Promega) and the values of absorbance were
normalized by deducting the negative control absorbance
(uncoated wells) from the absorbance value of coated
wells, and dividing it by the average of positive control
(wells coated with α-D-glucose). Statistical calculations
were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (*P <
0.05) by comparing normalized absorbance values for a
given substrate measured in two independent biological
and technical replicates with the readings for another
cell line. Biolog Phenotype Microarrays were performed
on glucose-restricted OVCAR3 sublines (Gluc-2 and
Gluc- 3), control OVCAR3, OVCAR3-GFP and -ZEB1
cells, OVCA433-GFP and -ZEB1 cells, as well as
OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and Gluc-3 sublines transformed with
shCtrl and shNNMT-3.

RNA sequencing
RNA extraction and quality control: RNA was
extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
and quantified using NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was qualified
using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit and the Agilent
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), only
high quality samples with high RNA integrity numbers
(RIN < 9) were used. Biological replicates of OVCAR3
control, OVCAR3 Gluc-2 and OVCAR3 Gluc-3 cells were
performed to enable downstream statistics.
Library preparation and sequencing: 1 µg of total
RNA from high quality samples was used as an input
into the Ion Total RNAseq kit v2 (Ion Torrent, Carlsbad,
CA), in which sample RNA was fragmented and reverse
transcribed, adapter-ligated and amplified according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing adapters were
ligated from the Ion Xpress™ Plus Fragment Library Kit
(Life Technologies). Libraries were quantified with Qubit
(Invitrogen) and qualified with the Agilent Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) before being
pooled in equimolar amounts and amplified onto Ion Sphere
Particles using Ion PI™ template OT2 200 Kit v3 (Life
Technologies). Finally, the samples were sequenced on the
Ion Proton™ using semi-conductor sequencing with Ion
PI™ Sequencing 200 v3 kit (Life Technologies) to a depth
of 12 to 25 million reads with a mean read length of 90 bp.
Bioinformatics: In brief, raw reads were filtered and
trimmed by FASTX toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/
fastx_toolkit/) then aligned to human reference genome
(hg19) using TMAP with the Gencode version 19 reference
human genome annotation (http://www.gencodegenes.
org). FPKM (fragment per kilobase of gene per million
reads sequenced) values were calculated for 23,847 genes
using Cufflinks 2.0.8. Poorly measured raw FPKM values
less than 1 were increased to a floor threshold of 1.1.
Raw FPKM values were then log2 transformed. Genes
with an average of 1 or less in addition to miRNAs and
SNORDs were removed from further analysis. In general,
libraries contained less than 2.5% of reads coming from
ribosomal RNA and over 90% of reads mapping to
the genome suggesting high quality RNA libraries for
downstream analysis. A two-tailed t-test was used to
assess the significance of gene expression differences

Computational analyses
Kaplan-Meier plots
The Kaplan-Meier plotter (http://kmplot.com) [60]
was used to generate Kaplan-Meier plots of overall (OS)
and progression-free survival (PFS) of ovarian cancer
patients from TCGA dataset, expressing high and low
levels of NNMT. The criteria for generation of plots were
set up to analyze only patients with ovarian cancer of
high-grade serous histology (stage III and IV).
Classification to different HGSC subtypes
NNMT expression in different HGSC subtypes was
