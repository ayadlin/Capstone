Abstract
Mechanisms of androgen dependence of the prostate are
critical to understanding prostate cancer progression to
androgen independence associated with disease mortality.
Transient elevation of transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B)
occurs after androgen ablation. To determine the role of
TGF-B on prostate response to androgen ablation, conditional TGF-B type II receptor knockout mouse models of
the epithelia (Tgfbr2 NKX3.1KO ) and stromal fibroblasts
(Tgfbr2fspKO) were used. After castration, the prostates of
Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO mice had apoptosis levels similar to those
expected for control Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice. Prostates of
Tgfbr2fspKO mice, however, had reduced regression and high
levels of proliferation associated with canonical Wnt activity throughout the glandular epithelia regardless of
androgen status. In contrast, Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates had
epithelial canonical Wnt activity only in the surviving
proximal ducts after castration. In vitro studies showed that
androgen antagonist, bicalutamide, transiently elevated both
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO stromal expression of
Wnt-2, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a. The neutralization of Wnt
signaling by the expression of secreted frizzled related
protein-2 (SFRP-2) resulted in decreased LNCaP prostate
epithelial cell proliferation in stromal conditioned media
transfer experiments. In vivo tissue recombination studies
using Tgfbr2fspKO prostatic stromal cells in combination with
wild-type or SV40 large T antigen expressing epithelia resulted
in prostates that were refractile to androgen ablation. The
expression of SFRP-2 restored the Tgfbr2fspKO-associated
prostate responsiveness to androgen ablation. These studies
reveal a novel TGF-B, androgen, and Wnt paracrine signaling
axis that enables prostatic regression of the distal ducts after
androgen ablation while supporting proximal duct survival.

Introduction
Prostate cancer continues to be a major cause of death in aging
men (1). The prostate is an androgen-dependent organ. As a result,
treatment for prostate cancer includes the inhibition of androgens.
Regardless of the initial positive response to androgen ablation,

the cancer frequently overcomes its dependence on androgens and
results in a drug-resistant cancer with few options for treatment.
Although androgen ablation therapy is intended to target the
prostate epithelia, the influence of the prostatic stroma on
androgen responsiveness of the adjacent epithelia is likely to be
critical in the long-term effectiveness of treatment.
Mature and differentiated prostate tissue is formed and
maintained by effects on androgen receptors within the stromal
compartment (2, 3). The concept of mesenchymal cells relaying
androgen sensitivity to the epithelia through paracrine interactions
is supported by tissue recombination experiments. Prostate
epithelia expressing a nonfunctional androgen receptor were
equally sensitive to androgen ablation, carried out by castration
of host mice, when compared with the control tissue recombinations generated with wild-type mesenchyme and wild-type
epithelia (4, 5). Yet mesenchymal cells with a nonfunctional
androgen receptor did not even support prostate epithelial
development (6). This suggested that the prostatic stroma plays
an instructive role in glandular development and potentially
influences responsiveness to androgen ablation in prostate cancer
progression (5). As a basis to understanding androgen-independent
prostate cancer, we investigated the mechanism for prostate
epithelial survival in the absence of androgens.
After androgen ablation, the prostate undergoes apoptotic
regression. In mouse models, reintroduction of androgens after
androgen ablation results in prostate regrowth originating from the
proximal ducts. This observation indicates that the proximal ducts
are inherently refractory to androgen ablation (7–9). Canonical
Wnt signaling is known to play a role in cell survival in many
tissues (10–12). Thus, we wanted to investigate a potential role for
Wnt signaling in the survival of proximal ductal tissue upon
castration. Another growth factor, transforming growth factor-h
(TGF-h), is thought to support prostatic apoptosis as its expression
coincides with androgen ablation in benign and cancer tissues
(13–15). TGF-h binds the TGF-h type II receptor (Tgfbr2) at the
cell surface to phosphorylate the TGF-h type I receptor and activate cytoplasmic proteins, predominantly Smad2 and Smad3 (16).
Both cooperative and antagonistic interactions of Wnt, androgen,
and TGF-h signaling pathways occur in the prostatic epithelia
(17–20). However, the role of Wnt and TGF-h signaling on
androgen dependence of the prostate is unknown.
We tested the hypothesis that paracrine Wnt signaling regulates
stromal-epithelial interactions in response to androgen ablation in
a TGF-h–dependent manner using mouse and allografting models.
Canonical Wnt signaling involves the activation of cognate frizzled
receptors at the cell surface that mediate h-catenin accumulation
leading to transcriptional activity in the nucleus (21). Here, we
report that canonical Wnt activity is present in the prostatic
epithelia of the proximal ducts of the prostate after androgen

ablation. Previously, we generated a Tgfbr2 conditional fibroblast
knockout mouse through FSP-1 Cre-mediated recombination of
Tgfbr2 exon 2 (Tgfbr2fspKO), which resulted in the development of
preneoplastic lesions (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) by 5 to
7 weeks of age (22). To further study the role of TGF-h on the
prostate epithelia after androgen ablation, here, we developed a
conditional epithelial Tgfbr2 knockout by crossing NKX3.1-Cre
mice with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice (23), termed Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO.
Another valuable tool was the Tg(Fos-lacZ)34Efu/J mouse model,
termed TOPGal, which enabled the visualization of canonical Wnt
signaling activity (24). Interestingly, the prostates of Tgfbr2fspKO
mice had constitutive Wnt signaling throughout the prostate and
were resistant to androgen ablation–induced regression. The 12T7f
LADY mouse model served as a transformed epithelial counterpart,
expressing SV40 large T antigen in the prostatic epithelia (25).
Tissue recombination allografting of the Tgfbr2fspKO prostatic
stroma was able to convert the androgen-dependent 12T7f LADY
prostatic epithelia to become refractile to androgen ablation.
Together, the data provide a mechanism for androgen-independent
survival of the prostate epithelia.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice. Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 (23) and Tgfbr2fspKO mice of C57BL/6
background were generated as previously described (22). The NKX3.1-Cre
mice, also in the C57BL/6 background, were crossed with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
mice to generate the Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO mouse model. The Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO mice
were further crossed with Rosa26 mice to enable visualization of cells
undergoing Cre-mediated recombination. TOPGal mice (24) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and crossed with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and
Tgfbr2floxE2/wt-CreFSP mice to generate the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal and
Tgfbr2fspKO/TOPGal mouse models. Prostatic epithelial organoids were
generated from 15-wk-old 12T7f LADY mice, at which time they developed
high-grade hyperplastic lesions and foci of adenocarcinoma (25, 26). All
mice were genotyped from ear punch biopsies. NKX3.1-Cre mice were
genotyped using the same Cre primers as the Tgfbr2fspKO mice (22). A single
f200-bp band indicated Cre expression. All other mouse genotyping was
performed as previously reported (23–25). Harlan Sprague-Dawley SCID
CB17/ICR hsd and C57BL/6 mice were used for tissue recombination and
tissue rescue allografting techniques, respectively. All animal procedures
were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Cell culture. Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO mouse primary prostate
stromal cell cultures were generated from prostates of 6-wk-old to 8-wk-old
mice, as described previously (27). Cultures grown between passages 10 and
30 were used for experiments. LNCaP cells were purchased and grown as
recommended by American Type Culture Collection.
Conditioned media experiments and [3H]thymidine incorporation.
Conditioned stromal media was generated by plating 750,000
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or Tgfbr2fspKO cells or for control 3,000,000 LNCaP
cells on a 100-mm dish similar to previously published reports (28).
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells were transduced with
either green fluorescent protein (GFP; control) or secreted frizzled related
protein-2 (SFRP-2) adenovirus at 105 virus particles/mL for 24 h before
replacing standard stromal cell culture media with 5% serum containing
media to allow virus production in stromal cells. The stromal cells were
incubated for 72 h in the stromal cell media containing 10 8 mol/L
testosterone or, if indicated, bicalutamide (10 5 mol/L). The stromal
conditioned media was transferred to 15 mL conical tubes and stored in
80jC at least 24 h up to 3 wk. The stromal conditioned media was thawed
and plated over LNCaP cells (10,000 per well) in 24-well plates. The
conditioned media was replaced after 72 h of incubation with fresh
conditioned media. In select conditions, fresh bicalutamide was also
included as part of the conditioned media. After 120 h of incubation of
LNCaP cells with stromal conditioned media, [3H]thymidine incorporation

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

assays were performed. Three hours before assaying for proliferation, cells
were given 2 ACi [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer) in serum-free RPMI per well.
Cells were washed in 1 mL 10% TCA for 10 min thrice then lysed with
300 AL 200 mmol/L NaOH for 30 min. The cell lysates (100 AL) were
measured for [3H]thymidine activity using a scintillation counter (29). All
treatment conditions were performed in triplicate.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for histologic analysis. GFP (1:1,000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ki67 (1:3,000, Vector Laboratories), and SV40
(1:1,000,Calbiochem) immunohistochemistry was performed by using
antigen retrieval with antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories)
diluted 1:100. After primary antibody incubation overnight, Dako Cytomation universal or rabbit kits were used for the secondary antibody and
development with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine. Terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed
using the ApopTag Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon).
Double immunohistochemical staining was performed for TUNEL followed
by staining for h-galactosidase (1:5,000; Abcam) developed with TrueBlue
Peroxidase Substrate (KPL). Immunohistochemical staining was systematically quantitated by taking a ratio of positively stained cells per epithelial
nuclei per field (200). Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed
Student’s t test.
Immunofluorescence. Cells (50,000) were treated with 5 ng/mL TGF-h
(Cell Sciences) on glass coverslips for 16 h. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4jC. Smad2 localization was visualized
using primary (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondary antigoat
Alexa Fluor 594 antibody (1:500; Invitrogen) on a Nikon epifluorescence
microscope.
B-Galactosidase tissue staining. Whole mouse prostates were dissected
and fixed in 4% PFA for 1 to 2 h, washed in PBS, incubated with X-gal for
3 h at 30jC, washed in PBS, and fixed in 4% PFA overnight. Processed
paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 8 Am and counterstained with
Nuclear Fast Red (Electron Microscopy Sciences).
Tissue recombination allografting. The tissue recombinations were
performed as previously described (30). Epithelial organoids were derived
by digesting prostates of 6-wk-old to 12-wk-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice or
15-wk-old LADY 12T7f mice in 675 units/mL collagenase with 0.04% DNase
type I at 37jC for 40 min as previously described (30). The organoids were
washed and pipetted into 50 AL collagen with stromal cells from
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or Tgfbr2fspKO mouse prostates and allowed to incubate
overnight at 37jC. The tissue recombinants were then allografted under the
renal capsule of syngenic C57BL/6 for 5 to 7 wk or SCID mice for 6 wk.
Castration of host mice was performed 3 to 7 d before sacrifice as indicated.
RNA purification and reverse transcription–PCR. RNA from cell
lysates was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s directions. Reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed for 32 cycles with the following primer sets: Wnt-2 forward
5¶GTTTGCCCGTGCCTTTGTAGATG and reverse 5¶CCGGGTGACGTGGATGTG, Wnt-3a forward 5¶TCTGCAGGAACTACGTGGAGATCA and reverse

Results
Stromal TGF-B responsiveness enables prostatic regression
after androgen depletion. Androgen ablation causes prostate
regression with a transient elevation of TGF-h expression (13).
However, the role of TGF-h on the prostate after androgen ablation
is not clear. We first developed a conditional Tgfbr2 knockout
targeted to the epithelia by crossing NKX3.1-Cre mice with
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice, termed Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO (conditional epithelial Tgfbr2 knockout). Further crossing the Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO mice

Paracrine Signals in Prostate Regression

Figure 1. Conditional knockout of Tgfbr2 in the prostate epithelia (Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO) did not significantly affect the response to androgen ablation compared with control
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostate allografts. A, immunohistochemistry for h-galactosidase expression (brown ) in tissue rescued Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO/Rosa26 prostates indicates
Cre recombination in the prostatic epithelia compared with control Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/Rosa26 prostates with no detectable staining. Sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin (blue ). The epithelial (E) and stromal (S ) compartments are indicated. B, top, H&E staining of Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO and Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 tissue rescue
allografts suggests similar prostatic development (n = 4); bottom, TUNEL staining (brown ) indicates differential apoptosis of the prostatic epithelia of Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO
and Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 allografts in hosts that were not castrated (+Androgen ) compared with hosts that were castrated ( Androgen ). Increased TUNEL-positive
epithelia after castration indicates responsiveness to androgen ablation. The increase in TUNEL-positive epithelia in intact compared with castrated Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
prostates was significant (P = 0.0379). The increase in TUNEL-positive epithelia in intact compared with castrated Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO prostates was significant
(P = 0.0056). Student’s t test evaluation determined P value of <0.05 is significant.

into the Rosa26 line enabled the immunohistochemical localization of h-galactosidase expression associated with Cre-mediated
recombination in the prostatic epithelia (Fig. 1A). Because the
Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO mice died perinatally, the prostates of these and
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice were rescued to the renal capsule of
syngenic C57BL/6 male hosts. H&E staining revealed little
difference in the ductal structures of the Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO prostates
compared with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 controls (Fig. 1B). However, the
Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO prostates had significantly higher epithelial turnover as shown by the apoptotic TUNEL staining (Fig. 1B, bottom)
compared with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 allografts. After castration, there
was a further elevation of epithelial TUNEL staining in the
Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO prostates as observed in Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 allografts.
Taken together, there was no significant difference in apoptotic
response observed between Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO
prostates after castration compared with their intact controls,
respectively.
As epithelial TGF-h signaling did not seem to affect androgen
responsiveness, the role of stromal TGF-h signaling was studied
using the Tgfbr2fspKO mouse model (conditional stromal Tgfbr2
knockout). The castration of Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice resulted in
42% and 55% decrease in the total prostate wet weights, after 7 and
14 days, respectively (Fig. 2A). In contrast, there was a negligible
decrease in Tgfbr2fspKO prostates wet weight 7 days after castration,

with f20% regression by 14 days. Histologic analysis revealed that,
7 days after castration, the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates, with
otherwise low cellular turnover, had an expected increase in
TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in both the epithelial and stromal
compartments and little evidence of proliferation observed by Ki67
staining (Fig. 2B). Before castration, Tgfbr2fspKO mice exhibited
slightly higher rates of apoptosis than Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice
(1.4-fold), accompanied by significant proliferation consistent
with the described PIN phenotype (22). Seven days after castration,
prostates from Tgfbr2fspKO mice had little apparent epithelial
apoptosis, yet remained highly proliferative based on TUNEL and
Ki67 staining, respectively. The apparent elevated proliferation of
the Tgfbr2fspKO stroma coincided with greater stromal expansion
compared with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates. Together, these data
suggested that normal prostate epithelial regression occurs in
response to stromal TGF-h signals.
Before further studying the androgen independence of the
prostates in Tgfbr2fspKO mice, we needed to establish that the
epithelial response resulted from the prostatic stroma and not
other systemic factors in these mice. The FSP-1 Cre promoter
targets a subset of fibroblasts throughout the body, including
prostatic fibroblasts (22, 31). We verified the loss of TGF-h
responsiveness in Tgfbr2fspKO cultured stromal cells by immunolocalization of Smad2 (Fig. 3A). A tissue recombination allograft

Figure 2. Tgfbr2fspKO prostates lose androgen responsiveness after androgen
ablation. A, percentage change in total wet prostate weight is shown 7 and
14 d after castration (Cx). Average Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO total wet
prostate weights are shown as a percentage of the respective total prostate
weight from intact Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 (Flox ) and Tgfbr2fspKO (KO) mice
(n = 5). B, 3 d after castration, DL prostate lobes of Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and
Tgfbr2fspKO mice were subjected to TUNEL staining (brown ), indicating
apoptotic cells and Ki67 staining (brown ) indicating proliferative cells.
Hematoxylin (blue ) was used as a nuclear counter stain. The stromal (S )
compartment is indicated and black arrows indicate positively stained epithelial
cells. Prostates were dissected from 5-wk-old to 7-wk-old male mice.
Dorsolateral lobes are shown and these effects are consistent with all other lobes
(n = 8). The increase in TUNEL positive Tgfbr2fspKO epithelia after castration
was significantly greater than Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 epithelia (P value = 0.0152).
The level of Ki67 positive Tgfbr2fspKO epithelia after castration was significantly
greater than Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 epithelia (P = 0.0003).

approach was then used to identify the role of the prostatic
stromal cells in the phenotype observed. The tissue recombination technique consisted of combining cultured stromal cells
derived from Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or Tgfbr2fspKO prostates with
epithelial organoids isolated by digesting mature wild-type
C57BL/6 mouse prostates. The tissue recombinants were
allografted to the subrenal capsules of syngeneic male mice
(32). Five weeks after grafting, the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and
Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells organized themselves around the
epithelial organoids to form prostatic glands (Fig. 3B). Seven
days after castration of the hosts, there was a 6-fold increase in
TUNEL-positive epithelia in the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stroma-associated glands (Fig. 3C). Note, in comparison, the Tgfbr2fspKO
stroma-associated glands did not show a significant increase in
TUNEL-positive epithelia. Ki67 staining indicated minimal proliferation in recombinants associated with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stroma
after castration (Fig. 3D ). In contrast, the recombinants
associated with Tgfbr2fspKO stroma had greater epithelial
proliferation after castration. Collectively, castration of the host
mice resulted in regression of the allografted tissue recombinants
associated with Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2, but not Tgfbr2fspKO stromal
cells. These observations further supported that the androgen
ablation refractile phenotype of our Tgfbr2fspKO mice resulted
from interactions within the prostate microenvironment.
Proximal ductal epithelial activation of Wnt signaling
after androgen ablation mediates stromal-epithelial crosstalk. The next step was to determine how TGF-h signaling
within the stroma was responsible for the observed regression in
the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or lack thereof in the Tgfbr2fspKO mouse
prostates. The proximal ducts of the prostate remain viable
as the distal ducts regress in the absence of androgen signaling. Up-regulation of Wnt ligands and activating mutations
of h-catenin in prostate cancer epithelium is a potential

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

mechanism for androgen refractory prostatic epithelial proliferation (33–35). To address the potential of a Wnt signaling
mechanism to support the androgen-independent prostate
survival phenotype observed, we developed a Tgfbr2fspKO/TOPGal
mouse model (conditional stromal Tgfbr2 knockout with a
canonical Wnt signaling reporter). Intact and castrated male
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal and Tgfbr2fspKO/TOPGal prostates were
subjected to whole mount h-galactosidase staining to visualize
canonical Wnt activity. In whole mount staining of prostates
from intact Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal mice, h-galactosidase
expression was not detected (Fig. 4A). However, 3 days after
castration, h-galactosidase activity was detected exclusively in
the proximal ducts of the prostate indicating activated h-catenin
signaling. This was further supported by elevated immunolocalization for h-galactosidase expression in the proximal glands
of Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal prostates after castration (Supplementary Fig. S2). By the 7th day after castration, little
h-galactosidase activity was detected in Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal
prostates (data not shown). In contrast to that observed in
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal prostates, Fig. 4A showed that the
Tgfbr2fspKO/TOPGal prostates had h-galactosidase expression in
the entire gland before castration with further elevated
expression after castration. In both Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal
and Tgfbr2fspKO/TOPGal prostates, only the epithelial compartment showed strong positive h-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4B
and C ). Costaining for TUNEL and h-galactosidase in
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal flox prostate glands, 4 days after
castration, illustrated that the epithelia expressing h-galactosidase did not overlap with epithelia undergoing apoptosis
(Fig. 4D). This finding suggested that the epithelia in the
proximal glands supported canonical Wnt activity during normal
prostatic regression after androgen ablation. In addition,
the hormone refractory Tgfbr2fspKO prostates supported constitutive paracrine canonical Wnt signaling. The coincident
localization of canonical Wnt signaling in Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/
TOPGal prostates and the reported region surviving androgen
ablation supported the possibility of a causal relationship
between the two events.
To determine if the observed epithelial Wnt activity could be due
to stromal regulation of Wnt ligand production, Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
and Tgfbr2fspKO cultured prostatic stromal cells were treated with
an androgen receptor antagonist, bicalutamide. The expression of
Wnt ligands was measured after androgen ablation over a time
course of 5 days by semiquantitative RT-PCR. There was a transient
increase in Wnt-2, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a 1 and 3 days after
bicalutamide treatment of Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stromal cells, with a
decrease in expression by 5 days (Fig. 5A). A similar trend was seen
with Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells, but with elevated basal expression
for Wnt-2, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a. Wnt-9a and Wnt-11 expression
were unchanged in both stromal cell types under the same
conditions. When Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stromal cells were treated with
bicalutamide and TGF-h, there was a lack of Wnt expression
compared with treatment with bicalutamide alone (data not
shown). Thus, inhibiting either the androgen or the TGF-h
signaling pathway could induce Wnt-2, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a gene
expression in prostatic stromal cells.
To determine the role of paracrine Wnt signaling on the
epithelial response to androgen ablation, the proliferation of
prostatic epithelial cells was measured in the presence of
conditioned media collected from either Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or
Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cell cultures. As seen in Fig. 5B, bicalutamide

treatment had little proliferative effect on either stromal cell
type grown in culture, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. As anticipated, the Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells were
notably more proliferative than the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stromal
cells. Bicalutamide treatment decreased the proliferation of the
androgen-responsive prostate cancer line, LNCaP epithelial cells,
as expected. Therefore, LNCaP cells were subsequently used as
the target epithelia to assess proliferative responsiveness to
conditioned stromal media treatment and androgen ablation.
Control GFP-transduced Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2-conditioned media had
lower proliferative response on LNCaP cells compared with the
enhanced proliferation using the GFP-transduced Tgfbr2fspKOconditioned media (Fig. 5C). Wnt expression by the stroma was
antagonized through adenoviral expression of SFRP-2 to stromal
cell cultures. The SFRP-2 transduced Tgfbr2fspKO-conditioned
media significantly decreased proliferation of LNCaP cells compared with GFP-transduced Tgfbr2fspKO-conditioned media. Bicalutamide treatment to the Tgfbr2fspKO stroma during generation of
conditioned media (Bic on Stro) further decreased LNCaP
proliferation, demonstrating the paracrine effect of androgen
ablation on epithelial cells. However, most dramatic was the direct
effect of androgen ablation on the epithelia with SFRP-2
transduced Tgfbr2fspKO-conditioned stromal media (Bic on Epi),
which resulted in a 50% decrease in LNCaP proliferation compared
with the GFP-transduced Tgfbr2fspKO-conditioned stromal media
control. This suggested that Wnt ligands expressed by both
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells support epithelial
survival in response to androgen antagonism.
Next, the role of TGF-h on Wnt expression during androgen
ablation in mice was determined. Previously, SFRP-2 has been
shown to inhibit Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a in vivo (36, 37). Based on
SFRP-2–mediated inhibition of prostatic epithelial cell proliferation in vitro, we hypothesized that it may restore androgen
dependence to the Tgfbr2fspKO prostate. The fragile condition of
Tgfbr2fspKO mice did not allow expression of SFRP-2 in these
mice directly. Therefore, we transduced control GFP or SFRP-2
adenovirus in intact Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO prostate
lobes and subsequently allografted the tissues under the renal
capsules of SCID mice in tissue rescue experiments. GFP staining
confirmed successful transduction of the allografted tissues
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Three days after allografting, the host
mice were either left intact or castrated for an additional 3 days.
There were no observable differences in apoptotic rate resulting
from the expression of GFP or SFRP-2 on Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and
Tgfbr2fspKO rescued prostates in the intact host mice based on
TUNEL staining (Supplementary Fig. S4). After castration of the
host mice, the Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates had the expected
elevation of TUNEL staining in both GFP and SFRP-2 transduced
prostates (Fig. 6A and B). The expression of GFP with
Tgfbr2fspKO prostates recapitulated the original observation of
refractivity to androgen ablation. TUNEL-positive epithelia in
GFP-Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates, 3 days after castration, were
significantly elevated compared with GFP-Tgfbr2fspKO prostates.
Note, in comparison, the expression of SFRP-2 resulted in a
3-fold increase in the apoptosis of Tgfbr2fspKO prostates after
castration similar to Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates. The restoration
of prostate regression in SFRP-2–Tgfbr2fspKO prostates after
castration indicated cooperation among the TGF-h, Wnt, and
androgen signaling pathways.

stromal TGF-h signaling in a prostate cancer model system was
examined. Our objective was to determine if the paracrine
instruction from the stroma to the epithelia observed in the
development of androgen refractory PIN lesions continued to
have an androgen refractory influence in the progression from
PIN to adenocarcinoma. This was achieved by allografting tissue
recombinants consisting of Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or Tgfbr2fspKO
stromal cells with prostate epithelial organoids from a prostate
cancer mouse model expressing the SV40 large T antigen in the
epithelia 12T7f LADY (25). Host male SCID mice were treated
weekly with either SFRP-2 or GFP control adenovirus. Five weeks
after allografting, half of the host mice were castrated. All grafts
were analyzed 6 weeks after grafting. The GFP-Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
stroma grafts (with LADY organoids) formed prostatic ductal
structures with minimal hyperplasia (Supplementary Fig. S5A and
B). After castration, the GFP-Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stroma-associated
grafts had elevated TUNEL-positive apoptotic epithelia. In
contrast, GFP-Tgfbr2fspKO stroma-associated grafts developed
adenocarcinoma (Fig. 6C, top). The GFP-Tgfbr2fspKO stromaassociated grafts had low levels of apoptosis (Fig. 6C, bottom).
SFRP-2–Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and GFP-Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stroma-associated grafts were similar with regard to apoptotic response to
androgen ablation. Notably, the SFRP-2–Tgfbr2fspKO stromaassociated grafts had elevated levels of TUNEL-positive epithelia
after castration, typical of normal prostate regression (Fig. 6D,
bottom). We also found that the SFRP-2–Tgfbr2fspKO stromaassociated grafts seemed more differentiated than analogous
GFP-Tgfbr2fspKO stroma-associated grafts. Thus, stromal androgen
and TGF-h signaling cooperates with epithelial Wnt signaling to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

regulate responsiveness to androgen ablation in benign, preneoplastic, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

Discussion
Our study showed that stromal responsiveness to TGF-h
allows androgen sensitivity in the prostate epithelia through
paracrine Wnt signaling. The direct role of TGF-h signaling on
the prostate epithelia after castration was minimal based on
histologic and apoptotic differences between the Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO
and Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostates. It is possible that compensatory
signaling by activin and its cognate receptors may provide Smad
protein activity similar to TGF-h. However, the conditional
knockout of the TGF-h type II receptor in fibroblasts, in the
Tgfbr2fspKO mice and tissue recombinants, indicated the
importance of TGF-h responsiveness in the stromal compartment after castration. Further crossing of the Tgfbr2fspKO mice
to the TOPGal reporter gene mouse model showed the regulatory
role of stromal TGF-h signaling on Wnt signaling in epithelial cells
refractory to androgen ablation. The Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells
themselves acquired a more proliferative phenotype (presumably
due to the loss of the growth inhibitory TGF-h signaling) and
promoted nearby epithelia to increase their rate of proliferation
and overcome hormonal dependence. The mechanisms behind the
observed phenomena highlight a stromal derived paracrine Wnt
signaling axis that is triggered upon androgen ablation. The stark
proximal ductal localization of canonical Wnt signaling activity in
control prostates after castration indicated duplicity of responses
to androgen ablation, one of survival and another for cell death.

Paracrine Signals in Prostate Regression

Thus, the data indicate that the role for TGF-h signaling after
androgen ablation is to suppress Wnt signals in much of the distal
prostate to enable regression.
Previous studies have shown that Wnt genes or proteins in the
Wnt signaling pathway are up-regulated or mutated in androgenindependent prostate cancers (10, 11). Castration provided a
transient elevation of canonical Wnt signaling in Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
prostates (Fig. 4). In parallel, Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 prostatic stromal
cells transiently express specific Wnt genes in response to an

androgen antagonist, bicalutamide (Fig. 5). In contrast, Tgfbr2fspKO
stromal cells had elevated basal expression of Wnt-2, Wnt-3a, and
Wnt-5a. Recently, preosteoblasts were reported to induce Wnt
signaling as a result of androgen stimulation, and through
paracrine signaling, the preosteoblasts subsequently increased the
proliferation of prostate cancer cells in a coculture system in vitro
(38). As preosteoblasts and prostatic stromal cells are both of
mesenchymal origin, together with the results presented, this
suggests a directional regulation of paracrine Wnt signaling by

Figure 5. Wnt signaling induced by androgen ablation of stromal cells affects epithelial proliferation. A, Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells were treated
with bicalutamide over 5 d to analyze Wnt gene expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The expression of 18S rRNA was used as a loading control. The results
shown are representative of three or more sets of RNA used to test each Wnt gene. B, [3H]thymidine incorporation assays were performed on Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
and Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells transduced with GFP-adenovirus and grown either in media containing testosterone or bicalutamide (Bic ) in the absence of testosterone.
[3H]Thymidine incorporation assays were performed on LNCaP epithelial cells also treated with or without bicalutamide for 5 d. Columns, average of three or more
replicates; bars, SD. Asterisks indicate significance compared with the respective control. GFP-Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stromal cells were not significantly affected by
bicalutamide treatment compared with control GFP-Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 stromal cells (P = 0.0580). GFP-Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells had a significant increase in
proliferation with bicalutamide treatment compared with control GFP-Tgfbr2fspKOstromal cells (P = 0.0016). LNCaP epithelial cells treated with bicalutamide
proliferated significantly slower than untreated LNCaP cells (P = 0.0025). Data are representative of three or more individual experiments. C, left, a cartoon of the
generation of conditioned media is shown. Conditioned media was collected from Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells and used to treat the target LNCaP
epithelial cells. Right, bar graphs show the results of these conditioned media experiments. Androgen responsive proliferation of LNCaP cells was measured
in response to a 120-h treatment with conditioned stromal cell media from Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 or Tgfbr2fspKO cells by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2
and Tgfbr2fspKO stromal cells were transduced either with GFP adenovirus as a control or Wnt antagonist SFRP-2 adenovirus before starting collection of conditioned
media. Bic on Stro, bicalutamide was added to stromal cell cultures during the generation of conditioned media; Bic on Epi, bicalutamide was added to epithelial
LNCaP cells simultaneously with stromal conditioned media treatment. Columns, average of three or more replicates; bars, SD. Compared with the GFP control,
P values for SFRP-2–Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 conditions are 0.207, 0.339, and 0.011 and for SFRP-2–Tgfbr2fspKO conditions 0.002, 0.005, and 0.004, respectively.
Each asterisk indicates statistical significance between the control and knockout data points for a given condition with a P value of <0.05 according to a

androgens. LNCaP cells, used in our coculture studies, are human
prostate cancer lymph node metastatic lesion that lack a functional
TGF-h type II receptor and have a functional, yet mutant, androgen
receptor (39). The LNCaP cells, analogous to the Tgfbr2NKX3.1KO
prostates, enabled us to show that androgen responsiveness
mediated by the stroma is not dependent on epithelial TGF-h
signaling. Antagonizing Wnt signaling in the absence of androgen
ablation in Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 and Tgfbr2fspKO prostates did not
induce apoptosis (Fig. 6). Thus, although TGF-h and androgen
signaling converge in the stroma to affect Wnt signaling, they act
through distinct pathways.
We showed that activated canonical Wnt signaling helps to
limit prostatic regression. It is known that Wnt ligands bind
Frizzled receptors on the epithelial surface and transmit signals
through the canonical pathway that activates h-catenin/TCF in
the nucleus (40). Activating mutations in h-catenin have been

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

identified to affect androgen receptor transcriptional activity and
ligand specificity (33, 34). Based on the specific TCF/h-catenin
activity in the proximal prostatic ducts of the castrated
Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2/TOPGal mice, the mechanism for the survival
of the proximal ducts may be through an initial activation of
epithelial canonical Wnt signaling. Comparing the Tgfbr2floxE2/
floxE2
/TOPGal and Tgfbr2fspKO/TOPGal mice, it was evident that
TGF-h signaling is important to regulate the spatial localization
of Wnt signaling to enable regression of the distal ducts in a
temporal coordination with androgen signaling. This is consistent with studies showing androgen-induced regeneration occurring at the distal tips of the prostate (41). One mechanism by
which the localization of Wnt signaling is limited could be due
to secreted Wnt inhibitors (e.g., SFRP-2, DKK-1) in the distal
glands. Long-term androgen ablation responses were not studied,
as the focus of the study was to determine the role of the

immediate up-regulation of TGF-h after androgen ablation.
However, as the prostate continues to regress after day 7, Wnt
signaling apparently is replaced by another mechanism to
prevent continued regression of the proximal ducts. The latter
events and maintenance of the regressed prostate is through a
separate mechanism that is more dependent on the availability
of androgens because some prostate regression was observed in
Tgfbr2fspKO mice 14 days after castration (Fig. 2).
Together, the up-regulation of TGF-h expression in the prostate,
coincident with androgen ablation, would support the regression of
the prostate by antagonizing stromal Wnt expression brought on
from an androgen-regulated mechanism. In normal proximal
prostatic tissue, the epithelial Frizzled receptor is activated
resulting in canonical, and possibly noncanonical, Wnt signaling,
which may contribute to the phenotypes seen in our mouse
models. However, based on previous reports that canonical Wnt
signaling supports survival and proliferation (21, 42), this is the
most likely mechanism that maintains the viability of proximal
prostate tissues in the context of androgen ablation. The entire
prostate does not involute in the absence of androgens, because
subsequent replacement of testosterone results in the regeneration
of prostatic tissue (43). Intriguingly, in other mammals, such as
deer, antler regeneration is reported to show a site-specific Wnt
signaling activation during regeneration (12). The fact that
activating mutations of h-catenin are found in androgen-independent prostate cancers (33) suggests that cancer cells can hijack the
same Wnt signaling pathways used to support proximal prostate
survival to aid in tumor survival. Understanding paracrine
interactions of TGF-h, androgen, and Wnt signaling in regulating
prostate regression may be linked to its regeneration after
androgen supplementation.

Stromal-epithelial interactions have proved to be important in
embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Based on the Knudson
multihit hypothesis of tumor development, we attempted to further
the progression of the PIN lesions associated with LADY 12T7f
epithelia, expressing the large T antigen, by recombining them with
Tgfbr2fspKO prostatic stromal cells, as the second mutagenic hit
(44). Figure 6 illustrated that the Wnt signaling associated with the
Tgfbr2fspKO cells not only enabled the PIN lesions to progress to
adenocarcinoma, but also enabled the epithelia to become
resistant to androgen ablation. Inhibition of Wnt signaling with
SFRP-2 seemed to restore androgen sensitivity and decrease
tumorigenicity of the resulting tumors. Future prostate cancer
therapies would most likely benefit by not only antagonizing the
traditional androgen signaling pathway, but also inhibiting Wnt
signaling. This would allow therapies to target both the epithelial
and stromal compartments, as well as androgen-dependent and
androgen-independent tumor cells.
