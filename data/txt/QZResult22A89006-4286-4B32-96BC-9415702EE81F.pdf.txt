ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comprising 85% of lung cancer cases, has
been associated with resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. The hypoxic tumor microenvironment, where insufficient vasculature results in poor drug penetrance and suboptimal chemotherapy in the tumor interiors contributes heavily to this resistance.
Additionally, epigenetic changes in tumorigenic cells also change their response
to different forms of therapy. In our study, we have investigated the effectiveness
of a combination of cisplatin with scriptaid [a pan-Histone Deacetylase inhibitor
(HDACi)] in a model that mimics the tumor microenvironment of hypoxia and sublethal chemotherapy. Scriptaid synergistically increases the efficacy of cisplatin in
normoxia as well as hypoxia, accompanied with reduced metastasis and enhanced
DNA damage. Addition of scriptaid also overcomes the cisplatin resistance exhibited
in lung cancer cells with stabilized hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1)-α (mutant) and
mutant p53. Molecular studies showed that the combination treatment increased
apoptotic cell death in both normoxia and hypoxia with a dual role of p38MAPK.
Together, our results suggest that the combination of low dose cisplatin and scriptaid
is cytotoxic to NSCLC lines, can overcome hypoxia induced resistance and mutant
p53- induced instability often associated with this cancer, and has the potential to
be an effective therapeutic modality.

INTRODUCTION

Standard treatment for advanced stages of NSCLC is
surgery followed by platinated drug-based adjuvant
therapy. Although cisplatin is a drug of choice for NSCLC
treatment [5, 6], patients are known to acquire drug
resistance.
Overcoming cisplatin-resistance, therefore, is a
crucial factor for developing anticancer therapy [7]. The
hypoxic tumor micro-environment is one of the key players
in acquired chemo/radio resistance mainly due to poor
penetrance. The resulting low doses in tumor interiors leads
to metabolic and genetic changes in a hypoxic cell favoring
cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis [8]. We have
shown previously, that low dose cisplatin induces genomic
instability in hypoxic glioma cells [9]. Hypoxia inducible
factor1α (HIF1α), identified by Wang and Semenza, is the
oxygen sensor which activates a host of hypoxia inducible

Lung cancer is a malignancy of the respiratory
epithelium and the leading cause of cancer related deaths
worldwide. Of the two types of lung cancer, small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
the latter comprises about 85% of the total cases [1].
Among the different genetic abnormalities associated with
lung cancer, mutations in p53, KRAS, EGFR and LKB1
are the most common. Mutations in p53 gene occur early
in cancer development and are maintained throughout the
advanced stages of tumor development [2, 3]. With an
overall survival rate of five years, the treatment outcome
of NSCLC still remains poor. However, the management
of locally advanced NSCLC has progressed significantly
with the use of combined therapeutic interventions [4].

genes [10]. Deletion of HIF1α in a mouse mammary tumor
virus (MMTV) promoter-driven polyoma middle T antigen
mouse model of breast cancer showed reduction in growth
of the primary tumors [11]. In contrast, HIF1α deletion in
a KRAS-driven mouse model of lung cancer had negligible
effect on tumor burden and progression, whereas a
deletion in its isoform, HIF2α increased tumor growth and
progression [12]. In renal cell carcinoma, stabilization of
HIF1α reduced tumor progression, while overexpression of
HIF2α resulted in increased tumorigenesis [13, 14]. Thus,
the role of HIF isoforms is complex and differs with tumor
and stromal cell types.
Overcoming this chemo-resistance with the help
of specific inhibitors and modulators has had moderate
success. For example, initial trials of tirapazamine
(TPZ) in combination with chemo/radiotherapy showed
promising results in NSCLC, cervical and head and neck
cancers [15–18] however, subsequent phase III trials failed
to demonstrate its effectiveness [19, 20].
Alterations in epigenetic marks- histone acetylation
and methylation of gene promoters- are also known to
contribute to the onset and progression of various types of
cancers [21]. Hypoxia has been shown to induce epigenetic
changes in the cancer genome by us [22] and others
[23–25]. In hypoxic conditions, histone deacetylases
interact with HIF1α to regulate the expression of many
genes. While interaction of HIF1α with HDAC1 downregulates HIF-targets such as RECK and Reptin [26, 27],
recruitment of HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC7 increases
the expression of HIF1α-regulated genes [28].
We have investigated the ability of scriptaid, a pan
HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) in sensitizing lung cancer cells
to low dose cisplatin. A low dose cisplatin is reflective
of what the hypoxic interiors of lung cancer are likely to
receive and what a patient needs, to minimize side-effects.
Considering the well-established role of hypoxia and
HIF1 in regulating key cellular and molecular pathways
in cancer progression, it seems relevant to investigate
therapeutic molecules and regimes in in vitro hypoxic
conditions. We have determined whether this combination
treatment can overcome cisplatin-resistance in hypoxia and
have investigated the underlying mechanism of cell death.
We have also studied the effectiveness of this combination
therapy in the p53 dominant negative lung cancer cells,
hence addressing the prevalence of a significant percent
of NSCLC. Lastly, we have studied combination therapy
in mutant HIF1α overexpressing genetic background to
address the molecular mechanism in more detail.

and scriptaid (Figure 1B) in normoxia. The IC50
concentration of cisplatin for A549and H460 was 4.3 μg/ml
and 3.5 μg/ml, respectively. The IC50 concentration of
scriptaid for A549 and H460 was determined at 2.8 μg/ml
and 2 μg/ml, respectively. To confirm the activity of scriptaid,
A549 cells were treated with three different concentrations
for 24 hrs and western blot analysis performed for the
acetylated histone H4. A concentration-dependent increase
in the expression of acetylated histone H4 was observed in
response to scriptaid (Supplementary Figure S1A).

Lung cancer cells showed cisplatin resistance in
hypoxia
Solid tumors are known to harbor heterogeneous
hypoxic regions in the interiors. We have assessed
cytotoxicity to cisplatin treatment in cells cultured in
two grades of hypoxia-1% O2 (1% hypoxia) and 0.2%
O2 (0.2% hypoxia). As expected, they showed variable
response to cytotoxicity. In 1% hypoxia, A549 cells
showed significant resistance to cisplatin compared to
that in normoxia for all four doses. But in near-anoxic
condition of 0.2% hypoxia, A549 cells exhibited resistance
only at higher doses (Figure 1C). On the contrary, H460
cells showed resistance to all doses of cisplatin in 0.2%
hypoxia whereas in conditions of 1% hypoxia the cells
showed resistance at higher doses of cisplatin but not
in lower and median doses (Figure 1D). Induction and
stabilization of HIF1α, was confirmed by western blotting
in A549 cells at both doses of hypoxia (Figure  S2A).
Overexpression of HIF1α-inducible genes- GLUT1
and CAIX validated the conditions of in vitro hypoxia
(Figure S2B). Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry
showed a G2-M and S-phase arrest at lower doses of
cisplatin and a dose-dependent increase in cell death in
normoxic condition. However, in hypoxic conditions, cell
cycle arrest was averted and the amount of cell death was
relatively lower. The G0-G1 population was significantly
higher in hypoxic conditions than that observed in
normoxia (Supplementary Figure S2C).

Scriptaid acts synergistically with cisplatin and
overcomes hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance
One low dose of cisplatin (2 μg/ml) and two
doses of scriptaid (1 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml) were selected
for studying cytotoxicity with combination therapy in
A549 and H460 cells. Sequential addition of drugsscriptaid treatment for 2–4 hrs followed by cisplatin
treatment- did not result in elevated cytotoxicity (data not
shown). Simultaneous addition of both the drugs showed
promising results. The combinations used- 2 μg/ml
cisplatin+1 μg/ml scriptaid and 2 μg/ml cisplatin+2 μg/ml
scriptaid-synergistically improved the efficacy of low
dose cisplatin in normoxic conditions (p < 0.005) in A549
(Figure 2A). Synergism was calculated as described by

Kern et al. (1998), where, an R index of >1.5 signifies
synergism. Further, the combination proved to be effective
in overcoming cisplatin resistance in both conditions of
hypoxia- 1% and 0.2 (p < 0.005). The R index of both
combinations were > 1.5 in 1% hypoxia and 0.2% hypoxia
(Figure 2A). DAPI staining of A549 cells showed an overall
higher number of apoptotic population in combination
treated samples compared to that observed in mono
therapy (Supplementary Figure S1B). It was observed that
scriptaid did not influence the expression of HIF1α under
hypoxia (Supplementary Figure S4A). Although single
agent cisplatin and scriptaid were less effective in hypoxic
conditions, the combination treatment leads to an increase
in apoptosis in these cells. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase

(PARP) expression further supports cytotoxicity data,
where the combination therapy synergistically improves
the toxicity of low dose cisplatin in all three conditionsnormoxia, 1% hypoxia and 0.2% hypoxia (Figure 2B). The
combination treatment was also effective in H460 cells in
both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Figure 2C).

Combination therapy inhibits migratory
behavior of A549 cells
For further analysis, a combination of 2 μg/ml
cisplatin+1 μg/ml scriptaid was used for all in vitro studies.
Clonogenic assay showed that the combination treatment
resulted in significantly fewer colonies compared to

CDH2 and SNAI2, together with the down-regulation
of CDH1- an epithelial marker (Figure 3C). Further
analysis of the EMT markers in response to treatment
shows that the combination treatment down-regulated
the expression of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). The
epithelial marker, CDH1, was up-regulated in response
to combination treatment in hypoxia (Figure 3D). Thus,
the combination treatment inhibits cell migration by
repressing mesenchymal genes.

and inhibited wound healing in both normoxia and hypoxia
(Supplementary Figure S3). In hypoxic conditions, single
agent treatment did not inhibit cell migration to the same
extent as that in normoxia. However, the doublet treatment
significantly inhibits cell migration in both conditions
(Figure 3B). Enhanced migratory behavior of lung
cancer cells in hypoxic conditions can be attributed to the
overexpression of mesenchymal markers viz. MMP-2, 3, 9,

Combination therapy leads to apoptotic cell
death in A549 cells

Cisplatin resistant A549/p53DN cells undergo
apoptotic cell death in presence of scriptaid

The combination therapy induced apoptotic cell
death in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions as
determined by AnnexinV labeling (Figure 4A). Single
agent cisplatin and scriptaid did not induce apoptosis.
However, majority of the cell population in combination
treated samples were in early and late phase apoptosis.
In combination treated samples of both normoxia and
hypoxia, enhanced expression of p53 and γ-H2AX
was observed (Figure 4B). Cleavage of caspase-3 and
caspase-8 indicates that the combination treatment
activates the extrinsic pathway of apoptotic cell death
(Figure 4C). NFκB expression remained unaffected by
mono and combination treatment in both conditions. The
expression of phosphorylated-p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK)
was differentially regulated compared to total p38MAPK.
The increased accumulation of p-p38MAPK in treated
samples indicates its role in apoptosis in normoxic
condition while, the over-expressed p-p38MAPK in
untreated hypoxic conditions is significantly reduced in
treated samples (Figure 4C).

Mutations in p53 are common in cancer, with
R175H position mutation being the most common. We
have generated a stable p53-R175H-dominant negative
(DN) mutant in A549 cell line to answer two questions(a) whether this mutation affects the sensitivity of cancer
cells to cisplatin and (b) can scriptaid improve the efficacy
of cisplatin in such a mutant background. The pCMVNeo-BamR175H vector codes for a mutant p53 gene
which dimerizes with cellular wt-p53 and renders it nonfunctional. The stable mutant cell line was generated and
confirmed by western blot analysis using p53-specific
monoclonal antibody (Figure 7A). Cytotoxicity assays for
cisplatin showed that the mutant cell line was significantly
resistant to all doses of cisplatin compared to the wildtype control (Figure 7B). MTT assay of A549-R175H in
both normoxic and hypoxic conditions shows a synergistic
effect of combination treatment (Figure S4C). In normoxic
condition, A549-R175H cells were less sensitive to single
agent cisplatin and scriptaid, while the combination therapy
lead to an increased accumulation of γ-H2AX indicating
greater amount of DNA damage in these samples (Figure
7C). Protein expression of PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-8
shows that the combination treatment leads to apoptotic
cell death in A549-R175H cells whereas single agent
treatment proved ineffective (Figure 7D). Further proof of
apoptotic cell death was provided by annexinV/PI staining
and flow cytometry analysis (Figure 7E). The combination
therapy led to significantly greater amount of cell death
compared to monotherapy with either cisplatin or scriptaid.
Thus, combination therapy with low dose cisplatin and
scriptaid can also overcome cisplatin-resistance which
results from a dominant-negative mutation of p53 in lung
cancer cells. Molecular analysis of apoptosis markers in
hypoxia shows an activation of caspase-8, while caspase-3
was not significantly affected by the combination treatment
(Supplementary Figure S4C).

Scriptaid sensitizes cisplatin-resistant HIF1αstable mutant cells to apoptotic cell death
One of the key players in regulating hypoxia-induced
cisplatin-resistance is the HIF1α. We generated a HIF1α
overexpressing stable mutant (HA-HIF1alpha P402A/
P564A-pcDNA3 vector) cell line to study the contribution
of HIF1α to our results on hypoxia. Stably transfected A549
cells showed elevated HIF1α expression even under normal
oxygen concentration (Figure 5A). Up-regulation of GLUT1
(about 8 folds) and CAIX (about 6 folds), the two HIF1αinducible genes, in A549-HIF1α mut cell line compared
to the vector control cell line (Figure 5B) confirmed the
effectiveness of HIF1α overexpression. The mutant cell
line also had a proliferative advantage over the vector
control A549 cells (Figure 5C). They showed resistance to
cisplatin induced cytotoxicity compared to A549 cells with
wt-HIF1α (Figure 5D) similar to our results in hypoxia.
The combination treatment also significantly reduced cell
migration (p < 0.05) in the mutant cell line compared to
single agent treatment (Figure 5E). Immunofluorescence
staining using γ-H2AX antibody showed that the mutant
cell line was more resistant to single agent cisplatin
and scriptaid than the wild type counterpart, while the
combination therapy resulted in an increased amount of
DNA damage (Figure 6A). The corrected total fluorescence
(CTCF) was significantly higher in combination treatment
than single agent treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B).
Lastly, annexinV/PI dual staining and flow cytometry analysis
shows the enhanced cytotoxicity via apoptosis of combination
treatment in a HIF1α over-expressing mutant background
(Figure 6B) similar to that in physiological hypoxia.

DISCUSSION
The hypoxic tumor microenvironment is a fertile
bed for chemo-resistance, genetic alterations and changes
in cellular phenotype. Low drug perfusion in hypoxic
interior of tumors changes the cytotoxicity and the
associated signaling networks. Cisplatin is a commonly
used drug for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
and patients often develop resistance to cisplatin over the
course of therapy and multiple mechanisms have been
attributed to the resistance, including hypoxia [31, 32].
On-going research efforts aim to overcome this chemoresistance, however, the outcomes have been limited.
In our study we have addressed this hurdle of hypoxiainduced cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer

cells in vitro, by using a combination of low dose cisplatin
and scriptaid.
We have noted dose-dependent cytotoxicity of
cisplatin and scriptaid on two lung cancer cell lines- A549
and H460. Both cells lines showed resistance to cisplatin
in the two grades of hypoxia studied, albeit at variable
doses. Thus, the heterogeneity of tumor hypoxia elicits
varied responses depending on the cells of origin. Similar
to other reports [33, 34], cisplatin induced an S/G2-M
phase arrest coupled with reduced G0-G1 cell population.
In hypoxic conditions, however, lung cancer cells
overcame S/G2-M phase arrest along with an increase in
G0-G1 population, a characteristic feature of hypoxia [35].
HDAC inhibitors such as TSA (trichostatin A) and

panobinostat have shown potential in overcoming drug
resistance in cancer therapy [36, 37]. While the use of
HDAC inhibitors such as TSA and SAHA (suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid) in cancer therapy has been well
studied, investigations on Scriptaid- a novel pan-HDAC
inhibitor- are less reported. We selected sub-lethal doses of
cisplatin and scriptaid for combination treatment to mimic
conditions likely to occur in hypoxic tumor interiors. In
all three conditions- Normoxia, 1% hypoxia and 0.2%
hypoxia- the combination proved to be significantly more
effective than monotherapy. The synergistic effect of
combination was calculated by the method described by
Kern et al. [38]. The combination was particularly more
effective in hypoxic conditions and led to more cell death

than single agent cisplatin. Low doses of either cisplatin
or scriptaid did not lead to significant DNA damage as a
single agent, while the combination elicits high levels of
DNA damage in both normoxia and hypoxia as observed
by morphology and flow cytometry analysis using
annexinV/PI dual staining.
Cisplatin is known to induce p53 and lead to the
activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [39]. We

observed enhanced p53 activation with increasing dose of
cisplatin. p53 expression in combination treatment was
not similar to high dose cisplatin. Thus, augmentation of
apoptosis upon doublet treatment may also involve other
pathways apart from the p53-induced apoptosis. Cleavage
of pro-caspase3 and pro-caspase 8 indicates that the
extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is active in doublet treated
samples. Our results indicate that p-p38MAPK plays

different roles in survival and cell death in response to
the micro-environment. p38MAPK has shown variable
characteristic in many studies, of promoting cell death
[40, 41] and enhancing survival, depending on the
conditions and cell-type [42]. Expression of p-p38MAPK
appears to play an important role in apoptosis in
normoxic condition, while it may provide cell survival

signals in hypoxic micro-environment. NFκB is a major
downstream effector of hypoxia response [43, 44] and
an important player in the immune response to cancer.
While, NFκB expression was elevated in hypoxia, its
expression remained unaffected in response to treatment
in both conditions. Tumor hypoxia has been shown to be
associated with necrotic cell death [45] and we observed

marginal necrosis in cells exposed to hypoxia. That the
combination treatment proved to be more toxic and
resulted in higher apoptosis than single agent cisplatin or
scriptaid, even in hypoxia, is an extremely relevant and
significant finding. Single agent treatment retards cell
migration and the combination furthers inhibits migratory
properties of cancer cells as observed by functional studies
and molecular analysis of EMT markers.
To determine whether HIF1α is the major effector
molecule of our observations on cisplatin-resistance in
hypoxia, we generated stable A549 cells expressing a
mutant form of HIF1α, which is stabilized under normoxia,
while maintaining the wild-type functions. A549/
HIF1α mut cells were significantly more proliferative
than cells with wild-type HIF1α. Over-expression of
HIF1α has been associated with enhanced cell migration
of cancer cell [46,  47]. The A549/HIF1α mut cells
were highly migratory, and similar to cells exposed to
hypoxia, responded weakly to single agent treatment.
The combination treatment significantly enhanced DNA
damage and apoptotic cell death in A549/HIF1α mut cells
apart from inhibiting cell migration. Thus, we conclude
that cisplatin-resistance of lung cancer cells in hypoxic
micro-environment is mostly regulated by HIF1α and the
combination therapy overcomes this resistance.
In order to address the role of major genetic
mutation in NSCLC, we generated a dominant negative
p53 expressing stable A549 cells- A549-R175H p53
mutant, to determine the effectiveness of the combination
therapy in this genetic background. p53 mutation is
a common phenomenon in lung cancer and linked
to decreased survival in patients receiving cisplatinbased chemotherapy [48], TP53 mutational spectrum in

human cancers has shown the R175H mutation occurs
most frequently with an overall frequency of 4.6% [49].
The A549-R175H cells were significantly resistant to
all doses of cisplatin compared to A549 cells with wtp53. Immunostaining with γ-H2AX showed that single
agent cisplatin and scriptaid did not result in significant
DNA damage in A549/R175H cells. The combination
therapy, however, led to synergistic enhancement in DNA
damage. Using annexinV/PI dual staining and western
blot analysis with cell death markers, we have shown that
the combination therapy is effective in a p53-dominant
negative genetic background and also overcomes cisplatin
resistance in lung cancer cells.
In our study we have determined the effectiveness
of low doses scriptaid and cisplatin combination therapy
in the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Apart from
the pre-dominant EGFR and RAS mutations that occur in
most NSCLC, significant population of patients acquire
p53 (R175H) mutations. The combination dose was,
hence, tested for cytotoxicity in vitro on the genotype
observed in two main groups of activating mutations
found in NSCLC patients, the EGFR-LKB1-RAS (A549
cell line) and EGFR-LKB1-RAS-p53 (A549-R175H p53
mutant cell line), in both normoxia and hypoxia.
Presently, the success rate of drugs from pre-clinical
phase to clinical trials remains poor. The combination of
low dose cisplatin and scriptaid is equally effective in
hypoxia, and possibly, the tumor interiors. The success of
the combination in vivo is, however, yet to be tested. We
believe that screening drugs by exhaustively addressing
the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment at the early
stage of pre-clinical trials, will increase the success rates
in vivo and eventually, in further trials.

harvested followed by an overnight fixation in 70% ethanol
at −20°C. Cells were washed with PBS to remove any
trace of ethanol and RNase (Invitrogen, USA) was added
to remove RNA from the samples. 40 μg of propidium
iodide (Sigma, USA) was then added to each sample and
acquired with BD-FACS Calibur. The data so obtained
were analyzed by WinMDI software (Version 2.9).

The human lung cancer cell lines- A549 (nonsmall cell lung cancer) and H460 (large cell lung cancer)
were procured from the National Centre for Cell Science
(NCCS), Pune and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA), supplemented
with 10% serum (FBS, Gibco, EU approved). Cells were
incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
For maintaining in vitro hypoxic conditions, cell culture
dishes were incubated in Anoxomat chambers (Mart®
Microbiology and the AnoxomatTM system) with regulated
concentrations of N2, CO2 and O2. Culture conditions
with atmospheric oxygen concentration is referred to as
normoxia, whereas culture conditions with 1% O2 and
0.2% O2 is referred to as 1% hypoxia and 0.2% hypoxia
respectively.

AnnexinV/PI staining analysis
AnnexinV FITC/PI dual staining is performed to
differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic cell death.
Cells seeded in cell culture dishes were given the indicated
treatments for 48 hrs. The cells were then harvested and
suspended in cold PBS. The dual staining using FITCAnnexinV and PI was done using manufacturer’s protocol
(#V13242, Invitrogen, USA). The samples were analyzed
by flow cytometry, measuring the fluorescence emission
at 530 nm and > 575 nm. Flow cytometry analysis was
done BD FACS Verse and the experiment performed in
three biological replicates. FlowJo software was used for
data analysis.

Cytotoxicity and viability assays
MTT assay was performed to determine the toxicity
of the drugs on lung cancer cell lines. Cells seeded in 96well plates, at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well, were
given the indicated drug treatment-Cisplatin (Sigma, USA)
and Scriptaid (Sigma, USA) for 72 hrs. 100 μl of MTT
solution (100 μg/ml) was added to each well and after
its conversion to a soluble formazan, cell viability was
measured by spectrophotometric absorbance at 490 nm.
For clonogenic assay, cells were seeded at a density of
1000 cells per well in 6-well plates coated with poly-Llysine (Sigma, USA). After giving the indicated treatment
for 2 hrs, cells were grown in regular growth media for
2 weeks. The resulting colonies were fixed, stained with
0.5% crystal violet and counted using the ImageJ image
analysis software.

Plasmid vectors
Two recombinant plasmid vectors were used in the
study. The HIF1α mutant coding plasmid- HA-HIF1alpha
P402A/P564A-pcDNA3 was gifted by William Kaelin
[29] (#18955). The expressed protein has a mutation
at amino acid position 402 and 564, which prevents its
degradation under normoxic conditions and retains its
function. The p53-dominant negative expressing plasmidpCMV-Neo-Bam-R175H was gifted by Bert Vogelstein
[30] (#16436). The mutant p53 protein has a mutation at
amino acid position 175. This dominant negative protein
dimerizes with the wild-type p53 and prevents its normal
functioning.

Wound healing and migration assay
For wound heal (scratch) assay, 1 × 105 cells per well
were seeded to form a monolayer of cells in 24 well plates.
A single wound was made in each well using a pipette tip
and the indicated treatment given. Images were captured
at time 0 and 24 hrs after wound infliction to determine
the amount of cell migration. ImageJ software was used
to calculate percent migration. In migration assay, cells
were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 in transwell inserts in
serum-free media. 800 μl of serum-containing media was
added in each well and inserts placed on top of each well.
Indicated treatments were then given to each well and the
plates incubated for 24 hrs. Cells trapped in the membrane
of the insert by virtue of the FBS gradient were fixed and
stained with Giemsa stain. The images were captured at a
magnification of 20× and number of cells counted using
the ImageJ image analysis software.

Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Cells were cultured in chamber slides and given
the indicated treatments. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde washed twice with cold PBS and then
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 mins at room
temperature. For immunostaining, cells were incubated
with rabbit-anti- γH2AX antibody in recommended
dilution overnight at 4°C. Alexa Fluor® 488 (Invitrogen,
USA) (1:100), prepared in 1% BSA, was added to each
well of the chamber slide and incubated for 1 hr. Actin
fibers were stained with phalloidin (Cytoskeleton,
USA) and nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma, USA). Fluorescent images

at the respective wavelengths were first captured on
an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX83,
Japan). For high resolution images, confocal images were
captured at 60X magnification of the objective (Leica TCS
SP5). Image analysis of confocal images was performed
using the LAS AF Lite software. CTCF was calculated
using ImageJ software.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Cells cultured in petri dishes were given indicated
treatments in respective conditions for 24hrs. RNA was
isolated using Trizol (Sigma, USA). Total RNA, eluted
in 40 μl of nuclease free water, was quantified using
Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, USA). 1μg of total RNA
was used for preparing 20 μl of cDNA according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Revert Aid cDNA synthesis,
#K1621). All primers for real-time PCR were prepared
using the Primer3 online tool. Real-time PCR was
performed in Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) by using FIREPol
EvaGreen (Solis Biodyne, #08-24-00001) master mix.
β-2-microglobulin (B2M) was used as the internal control.
Each experiment was performed in three replicates.
