Tumoral Selection of Resistance to RAF Inhibitors

Abstract
Activation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) confers resistance to the RAF
inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib in mutant BRAF-driven melanomas. Methods to understand how
resistance develops are important to optimize the clinical use of RAF inhibitors in patients. Here, we report
the development of a novel ERK1/2 reporter system that provides a noninvasive, quantitative, and temporal
analysis of RAF inhibitor efﬁcacy in vivo. Use of this system revealed heterogeneity in the level of ERK1/2
reactivation associated with acquired resistance to RAF inhibition. We identiﬁed several distinct novel and
known molecular changes in resistant tumors emerging from treatment-na€ve cell populations including
BRAF V600E variants and HRAS mutation, both of which were required and sufﬁcient for ERK1/2
reactivation and drug resistance. Our work offers an advance in understanding RAF inhibitor resistance
and the heterogeneity in resistance mechanisms, which emerge from a malignant cell population. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is aberrantly regulated in multiple tumor types. Mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF (mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) that activate ERK1/2 signaling are found in
7% of human cancers with a high frequency (45%–50%) in
cutaneous melanoma. Clinical inhibitors targeting steps in the
ERK1/2 pathway are being actively pursued. Recent successes
are the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of
the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib in
late-stage mutant V600E BRAF melanomas. Vemurafenib,
PLX4720 (the tool compound of vemurafenib), and dabrafenib
are selective inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK)-ERK1/2 pathway in mutant V600E BRAF cells
(1–3). Patients with effective responses showed more than 80%
inhibition of phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK)1/2, as judged by immunohistochemical staining
of biopsy samples (2).
RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib are burdened by two
issues. First, nearly all patients who initially respond to vemurafenib, acquire resistance, and develop progressive disease.
Acquired resistance is associated with reactivation of the

ERK1/2 pathway by mechanisms involving mutations in neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), expression of
COT1/MAP3K8, acquisition of MEK1 mutations, ampliﬁcation
of mutant BRAF, and expression of BRAF V600E splice variants
(4–8). In addition, resistance mechanisms that are MEK-ERK1/
2 independent have been described (8–11). MEK1/2 inhibitors
elicit minimal clinical effects in patients progressing on vemurafenib (12) and there is a critical need to develop second-line
treatments for vemurafenib-resistant disease. A second issue is
that vemurafenib-induced paradoxical activation of the ERK1/
2 pathway in wild-type BRAF cells has been linked to the
formation of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/keratoacanthoma (cuSCC/KA), adenomas, and leukemia (13–18). This
paradoxical signaling effect is driving the design of next
generation of RAF inhibitors.
In this study, we developed an in vivo ERK1/2 activity
reporter system in mutant BRAF melanoma cells. We used
this system to temporally quantitate the effect of the RAF
inhibitor, PLX4720, on ERK1/2 activity across the whole
tumor in vivo and to analyze ERK1/2 pathway reactivation
and associated genetic changes during acquired resistance
to PLX4720.

Gideon Bollag and Plexxikon Inc.. AZD6244 (selumetinib) and
GSK1120212 (trametinib) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Cells lines were authenticated by DNA sequencing at
multiple loci.
Lentiviral cloning
pLenti4.3/V5-DEST, pLentineo3/V5-DEST, pLentihygro3/
V5-DEST, and pLentipuro/V5-DEST vectors are modiﬁcations
of pLenti6/V5-DEST (Invitrogen). Renilla luciferase and GAL4ELK1 were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) from
pRL-TK (Promega Corp.) and pFA2-Elk1 (Agilent Tech.),
respectively. The 50 upstream activation sequences (UAS) and
minimal promoter of pFR-Luc (Agilent Tech.) was cloned into
pENTR/D-TOPO upstream of an EGFP-ﬁreﬂy luciferase fusion
gene. An additional 5 copies of the tandem UAS were added
upstream (10 copies of UAS in total) to enhance transcription
of the transgene. Stop codons were omitted from both Renilla
luciferase and EGFP-ﬁreﬂy luciferase to allow for in frame
fusion with C-terminal V5 epitopes found in all of the aforementioned lentiviral vectors. Wild-type HRAS, full-length
BRAF V600E, BRAF V600E DEx 3-10, and BRAF V600E DEx
2-8 were ampliﬁed from cDNA libraries and cloned into
pENTR/D-TOPO. HRAS Q61K was generated via site directed
mutagenesis of pENTR/D-TOPO/HRAS-WT. Transgene cassettes were transferred to their respective lentiviral vectors by
LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) and lentiviruses were packaged in
293FT cells as previously described (19).
Generation of reporter cells
1205LuTR cells were transduced for 72 hours with UAS/
EGFP-ﬁreﬂy luciferase and UbC/Renilla luciferase lentiviruses.
Cells were selected simultaneously with 500 mg/mL Geneticin
(Invitrogen) and 200 mg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen). Resistant cells
were subsequently transduced with UbC/GAL4-ELK1 virus for
72 hours, followed by selection with 200 mg/mL HygroGold
(Invivogen). 1205LuTR reporter cells expressing high basal
EGFP following transduction of GAL4-ELK1 virus were
enriched by cell sorting for in vivo experiments.

Competitive allele-speciﬁc TaqMan PCR
CAST (competitive allele-speciﬁc TaqMan) PCR reactions
were used to determine percentage of HRAS Q61 allele present
in each sample. Reactions were conducted on the ABI 7500
FAST system (Life Technologies) as a quantitation/standard
curve experiment and compared to internal positive controls.
Mutation percentage of each sample was determined by
Mutation Detector Software v 2.0 (Life Technologies) using
the Ct values of the mutant and wild-type assays.
PCR
To detect BRAF splice variants, cDNA libraries were generated using an oligo(dT) primer and used as templates for
further PCR ampliﬁcation using the following primers: forward, 50 -TTATAAGATGGCGGCGCTGAGCG-30 ; reverse, 50 TCAGTGGACAGGAAACGCACCATATCCC-30 .

Western blotting
Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting, as previously
described (20). Antibodies were purchased from the following:
GFP and V5 (Invitrogen); actin (Sigma-Aldrich); ERK2, BRAF,
HRAS, and cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotech.); and phospho-ERK1/2
and phospho-Rb Ser780 (Cell Signaling Technology).

siRNA transfections
Cells were transfected with siRNAs at a ﬁnal concentration of 25 nmol/L using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Nontargeting control (50 -UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-30 ), ERK1 (50 -CCGCCAGACUGUUAGAAAAUU-30 ),
ERK2 (50 -CCAAAGCUCUGGACUUAUU-30 ), BRAF full length
(50 -CCGAGACAGUCUAAAGAAAUU-30 ), BRAF DEx 3–10 (50 AUAUCUGGAGAAAACACUUUU-30 ), BRAF DEx 2–8 (50 UCCGGAGGAGGACUUGAUUUU-30 ), HRAS smartpool (50 CCAUCCAGCUGAUCCAGAA-30 , 50 -GAACCCUCCUGAUGAGAGU-30 , 50 -GGAAGCAGGUGGUCAUUGA-30 , 50 -GAGUGGAGGAUGCCUUCUA-30 ), and HRAS #8 (50 -AGACGUGCCUGUUGGACAU-30 ) siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon.

In vivo experiments
1205LuTR reporter cells (1  106) were injected intradermally into female athymic mice (NCr-nu/nu: NCI-Frederick,
MD) and allowed 11 days to reach appropriate volume (100
mm3). Mice were then fed either AIN-76A (Vehicle) chow or
AIN-76A with 417 ppm PLX4720 chow (Plexxikon Inc.). Digital

Cell viability assays
Cells were plated at a conﬂuency of 4  104 cells per well of a
6-well plate and treated as indicated. Media and drugs were
replenished once. After 5 days, 1 AlamarBlue (Invitrogen) was
added to each well and allowed to reduce for approximately
30 minutes. Medium was collected in triplicate from each

Dual luciferase assay
Cells were lysed and ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luciferase activities
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega) on a Glomax luminometer (Promega).

caliper measurements of tumor size were taken to calculate
tumor volume using the following formula: volume ¼ (length 
width2)  0.52. In vivo bioluminescence was conducted using
the Caliper IVIS Lumina-XR System (Caliper Life Sciences)
and the data acquisition LivingImage Version 4.0 software
(Caliper Life Sciences). For Renilla luciferase, mice were
imaged after tail vein injection of Rediject coelenterazine
(100 mL of 150 mg/mL stock, Caliper Life Sciences). For ﬁreﬂy
luciferase, mice were imaged after intraperitoneal injection of
D-luciferin (100 mL of 15 mg/mL stock, Caliper Life Sciences).
Fireﬂy luciferase was measured at least 1 hour after Renilla
luciferase measurement, and diminished signal intensity was
conﬁrmed before each ﬁreﬂy luciferase image was acquired.
Signal intensity was quantiﬁed within a region of interest, as
deﬁned by the LivingImage software and was appropriately
adjusted using tumor volume measurements. Because of the
damage inﬂicted on the tail veins following multiple injections,
we chose to normalize tumor volume by the more consistently
determined digital caliper measurements for the extended
experiments.

condition and the absorbances of oxidized and reduced AlamarBlue were measured at wavelengths 600 and 570 nm,
respectively, in a Multiskan Spectrum spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). The change in viability was calculated
from the resulting absorbances using the manufacturer's
guidelines. All conditions were normalized to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control.
Colony formation assays
Cells were plated at a conﬂuency of 1.5  105 cells per 10cm dish and treated as indicated. Media and drugs were
replenished twice. After 7 days, cells were stained with
crystal violet in formalin for 30 minutes. After excess stain
was washed away, colonies were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse
Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) with NIS-Elements AR 3.00
software (Nikon). The percent plate coverage is indicated as
determined from 5 independent areas per plate using ImageJ
software.
Statistical analyses
Where noted, the data were analyzed using 2-tailed,
unpaired Student t test, assuming unequal variances. For
experiments assessing in vivo tumor growth, data were analyzed using mixed effects model and Tukey multiple comparisons correction. Analyses were conducted using SAS software.
Study approval
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care accredited facility at Thomas Jefferson University
(Philadelphia, PA).

Results
Generation of an ERK1/2 melanoma cell reporter system
Mutant BRAF melanoma cells, 1205LuTR, were transduced to express an EGFP-ﬁreﬂy luciferase fusion gene
under the control of a minimal promoter with 10 tandem
copies of the GAL4 upstream activation sequence (UAS;
Supplementary Fig. S1). For an internal control, cells were
also transduced with Renilla luciferase driven from the
constitutive human ubiquitin C (UbC) promoter. TR versions of 1205Lu cells were used to permit future molecularbased approaches. The resulting reporter cells (1205LuTR
Ubc/RL UAS/EGFP-Luc) exhibited virtually no ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity relative to Renilla activity (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). To produce high ﬁreﬂy luciferase expression that was
ERK1/2 responsive, cells were transduced with UbC-driven
GAL4-ELK1, a fusion protein with transcriptional activity
that is dependent upon phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (refs. 21,
22; Supplementary Fig. S2A).
To determine responsiveness to RAF/MEK1/2 inhibition,
we used 2 RAF inhibitors (PLX4720 and vemurafenib) and 2
MEK1/2 inhibitors (AZD6244/selumetinib and GSK1120212/
trametinib). 1205LuTR reporter cells showed a strong reduction in the ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity relative to Renilla luciferase following 24 hours of treatment with these compounds
(Fig. 1A). Depletion of ERK1 and ERK2 via siRNA transfec-

tion also dramatically lowered ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity (Fig.
1B and Supplementary Fig. S2B). Levels of V5-tagged EFGP
ﬁreﬂy luciferase were reduced in response to RAF and MEK
inhibitors, whereas Renilla luciferase levels remained unaffected as measured by Western blotting (Supplementary
Fig. S2C) and ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
These in vitro data show the generation of an ERK1/2
reporter melanoma model.
Efﬁcient ERK1/2 inhibition in vivo precedes effects on
tumor xenograft shrinkage by days
To test the application of this system in vivo, xenograft
tumors were established by injecting 1205LuTR reporter
cells intradermally into athymic nude mice. Tumors were
allowed to form for 11 days at which time tumor volume and
Renilla luciferase expression were comparable between
mouse cohorts (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3). Cohorts
were then treated with either PLX4720 chow or control
chow. After 2 days of treatment, ﬁreﬂy luciferase expression
was signiﬁcantly lower in PLX4720-treated mice compared
to vehicles, an effect that was observed in all mice with a 77%
to 98% range of inhibition (Fig. 1C and D). Fireﬂy luciferase
expression was normalized to tumor volume as determined
by digital caliper measurements as opposed to Renilla
luciferase intensity measurements due to less variability in
the reading caused by the rapid turnover of the Renilla signal
in vivo. Noticeable inhibition of xenograft growth by
PLX4720 lagged behind reduction of ERK1/2 reporter activity and was only apparent in between days 4 and 7 (Fig. 1E).
These data model temporal inhibition of ERK1/2 in vivo and
show that pathway inhibition precedes inhibition of tumor
growth.
ERK1/2 reactivation is associated with rapid tumor
regrowth in vivo
We continued PLX4720 treatment of the 1205LuTR reporter
xenografts. ERK1/2 activity was inhibited by PLX4720 through
treatment day 28; however, xenografts displayed enhanced
ERK1/2 activity between 28 and 35 days, which often increased
to levels above those of pretreatment xenografts by day 42
(Fig. 2A). Reactivation of ERK1/2 was closely associated with
enhanced tumor growth (Fig. 2B). Analysis of individual
tumors showed a dramatic variation in the level of ERK1/2
reactivation. Half of the tumors (4/8) displayed ERK1/2 reactivation to a level above the pretreatment starting point (Fig.
2C and D). The remainder (4 of 8) xenografts showed partial
reactivation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2C and D). These data show that
ERK1/2 pathway reactivation to different levels is associated
with resistance to PLX4720 in vivo.
Heterogeneous molecular changes are found in
PLX4720-resistant xenografts
To characterize molecular events that lead to ERK1/2
pathway reactivation in vivo, tumors were harvested at day
49 and hereafter are referred to as PLX4720-resistant tumors
(PRT). We were able to establish 4 of 8 PRTs as cell lines in
the presence of PLX4720. Consistent with in vivo reporter
activity, Western blotting showed heightened but varied

in the presence of PLX4720 but heightened phosphorylation
of AKT (Supplementary Fig. S4E). These data show differ-

In the 1205Lu reporter system, sequencing of gDNA obtained from tumor tissue showed that all 8 PRTs maintained
BRAF V600E positivity. PRT #8, however, showed enhancement
of the BRAF V600E allele compared to vehicle-treated tumors
indicating BRAF V600E homozygosity (Fig. 3B). This ﬁnding
was conﬁrmed by quantitation of ionTorrent sequencing and
CAST PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). Although no
PRTs showed acquisition of NRAS mutations (Fig. 3B),
sequencing revealed an HRAS Q61K mutation in PRT #6 (Fig.
3B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). CAST PCR, which considers a
sample positive if the level of HRAS Q61K present in the DNA
sample is above 0.1%, did not detect mutant HRAS in the
parental cells (Fig. 3C).

MAPK/ERK1/2 Activity Reporting in Melanoma

whereas knockdown of BRAF V600E variants in their respective cell line reduced basal phospho-ERK1/2 levels (Fig. 4A and
B). In PLX4720-treated conditions, knockdown of full-length
BRAF V600E reduced phospho-ERK1/2 levels by 50% to 80%,
whereas variant knockdown caused a near complete reduction
(Fig. 4A and B). The viability of variant knockdown cells
was also signiﬁcantly reduced by PLX4720 treatment (Fig.
4C). BRAF variant–speciﬁc siRNAs did not inhibit phosphoERK1/2 signaling in parental cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
In PRT #6, knockdown of HRAS in combination with
PLX4720 treatment efﬁciently ablated phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig.
4D). This effect was speciﬁc to HRAS and was not observed
with either NRAS or KRAS knockdowns (Supplementary Fig.
S5C). In addition, viability was signiﬁcantly decreased in HRAS
depleted cells treated with PLX4720 (Fig. 4E). These data show

Identiﬁed BRAF V600E variants and mutant HRAS
promote ERK1/2 reactivation
Next, we tested whether the identiﬁed molecular changes in
PRTs were necessary for resistance to PLX4720. We focused on
1205Lu reporter PRTs #3 (BRAF V600E DEx 3-10), #4 (BRAF
V600E DEx 2-8), and #6 (HRAS Q61K). These cell lines showed
strong resistance to phospho-ERK1/2 inhibition by PLX4720 in
vitro; in contrast, PRT #2 was partially sensitive to PLX4720
(Fig. 3A). In PRT #3 and PRT #4, co-knockdown of full-length
and variant forms of BRAF V600E effectively reduced levels of
phospho-ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). To differentiate
which form of BRAF V600E was important for signaling in PRTs
#3 and #4, we used siRNAs designed to speciﬁcally target either
full-length or variant BRAF. In the absence of PLX4720, knockdown of full-length BRAF had no effect on phospho-ERK1/2,

MAPK/ERK1/2 Activity Reporting in Melanoma

The effects of mutant BRAF inhibition could be visualized
in vivo with PLX4720 rapidly and efﬁciently reducing ﬁreﬂy
luciferase activity in xenografts. The importance of effective
ERK1/2 inhibition is underscored by evidence that more than
80% loss of phospho-ERK1/2 staining is correlated with a
clinical response (2). Of note, this system selectively measures
activity within the tumor as opposed to ﬁne-needle aspirate
samples, which may contain stromal components. Because
of the quantitative readout, a use of this system is to conduct
in vivo side-by-side comparisons of modiﬁed compounds to
select for those with the best efﬁcacy and pharmacokinetic
properties.
Reactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway is one of the main
causes of acquired resistance in patients with melanoma
who initially respond to RAF inhibitors (5, 7, 8). Using this
reporter system, we show reactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway in tumors progressing while on PLX4720, providing an
improved understanding of ERK1/2 reactivation kinetics in
vivo. Interestingly, there is heterogeneity in the response
with some of the tumors showing only a partial reactivation
of ERK1/2. This suggests that only a threshold of ERK1/2
reactivation may be necessary for relapse and/or variations
in growth kinetics may be attributable to other signaling
pathways. The use of this system to determine the extent
and timing of ERK1/2 reactivation may be important in
studying acquired resistance to RAF inhibitor–based combinations such as dabrafenib and trametinib, which is being
tested in ongoing clinical trials (23).
Molecular changes associated with these PLX4720-resistant
tumors also showed heterogeneity and included BRAF V600E
homozygosity, HRAS mutation, and expression of BRAF V600E
variants. Recently, another group generated a vemurafenibresistant tumor from a patient-derived xenograft model and
subsequent sublines (24). One of 9 sublines showed BRAF copy
number gain, consistent with genomic ampliﬁcation at this
locus (24) and underscores our observation that multiple
molecular changes can occur within a single cell line. Although
there have been several reports of NRAS mutations associated
with vemurafenib resistance (5, 8, 25), our data suggest that
analysis of HRAS mutations is also warranted. In addition, we

identiﬁed 2 distinct BRAF V600E variants in PRTs. We were
unable to detect the presence of these molecular changes in the
parental cells; however, we do not rule out that they are present
in a very small percentage of cells and selected for during the in
vivo drug treatment. The heterogeneity of resistant tumors
indicates that biopsies should be taken from multiple sites in a
patient and that a wide range of RAS mutations and BRAF
V600E variants should be included in molecular tests designed
to detect the onset of resistance.
