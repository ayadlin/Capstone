ABSTRACT:
The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has considerably improved
the survival of patients suffering chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Indeed,
inhibition of BCR-ABL by imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib triggers durable responses
in most patients suffering from this disease. Moreover, resistance to imatinib due to
kinase domain mutations can be generally circumvented using dasatinib or nilotinib,
but the multi-resistant T315I mutation that is insensitive to these TKIs, remains
to date a major clinical problem. In this line, ponatinib (AP24534) has emerged
as a promising therapeutic option in patients with all kinds of BCR-ABL mutations,
especially the T315I one. However and surprisingly, the effect of ponatinib has not
been extensively studied on imatinib-resistant CML cell lines. Therefore, in the present
study, we used several CML cell lines with different mechanisms of resistance to
TKI to evaluate the effect of ponatinib on cell viability, apoptosis and signaling. Our
results show that ponatinib is highly effective on both sensitive and resistant CML
cell lines, whatever the mode of resistance and also on BaF3 murine B cells carrying
native BCR-ABL or T315I mutation. We conclude that ponatinib could be effectively
used for all types of TKI-resistant patients.

INTRODUCTION

of resistance to imatinib have been identified, such as
BCR-ABL point mutations involving or not the kinase
domain or increased expression of BCR-ABL [5]. In
addition to these BCR-ABL dependent events, several
BCR-ABL independent mechanisms have been also
reported, including increased expression and/or activation
of tyrosine kinases including, the Src tyrosine kinases Lyn
[6, 7] and Fyn [8, 9] and the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl
[10, 11] as noticeable examples.
Regarding BCR-ABL kinase mutations, the multiresistant T315I one remains a crucial clinical challenge,
since until recently, there is no effective treatment for

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a disease
of the hematopoietic stem cell, characterized by the t(9 ;
22) q(34 ; q11) translocation encoding the oncoprotein
BCR-ABL [1]. Patients suffering CML benefit from newtargeted therapies based on the use of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs). Three TKIs, imatinib, dasatinib and
nilotinib that target BCR-ABL are routinely given with
success as first or second-line treatment for this disease,
but resistance occurs in a significant proportion of CML
patients [2-4]. Several BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms

the patients carrying this particular type of mutation.
Ponatinib is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that exhibits
high activity against the T315I mutation but also other
BCR-ABL kinase mutants in vitro [12, 13]. In addition,
ponatinib has proven efficacy in mouse models of CML
and was also found to be effective in a small cohort of
patients with T315I mutations in two recent clinical
trials [12, 14, 15] (phase 1: NCT00660920 ; phase 2:
NCT01207440; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Surprisingly, although ponatinib represents
a promising molecule for patients with BCR-ABL
mutations, its mechanism of action has not been
extensively studied, more particularly in imatinib-resistant
CML cells with no BCR-ABL mutation. In this line, we
have previously generated several imatinib-resistant cell
lines from the parental K562, JURLMK1 and Lama CML
cell lines [8, 16, 17].
In the present study, we took advantage of the
availability of these cell lines to evaluate the effect of
ponatinib in comparison to other TKIs on cell metabolism,
proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, we used the
murine BaF3 cell line carrying either a wild-type BCRABL protein or its T315I and G250E mutated counterparts
to decipher the mechanisms of action of this TKI. We show
that ponatinib is highly efficient to induce cell growth
inhibition and induction of apoptosis on different imatinib
CML cell lines, whatever their mode of resistance.

CML cells and for the different imatinib-resistant cells
lines were very close (1 to 6nM versus 8 to 30nM) (Figure
1E). The IC50 values for imatinib were 0,15 to 0,5µM
in parental cells versus more than 3µM in the resistant
one. In addition, the IC50 values for dasatinib were 0.5
to 30nM in parental cells and 30 to more than 300nM
in resistant cells. As a whole our findings confirmed the
efficacy of ponatinib on the T315I mutation, but also
highlighted the notion that ponatinib is effective on all
types of imatinib-resistant CML cells, whatever their
mode of resistance. Importantly, the IC50 values obtained
for ponatinib in the present study for BaF3-WT-BCRABL, BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL and BaF3-G250E-BCRABL (1nM, 8nM and 8nM respectively) were very similar
to the one reported previously by O’ Hare et al. (0.5, 11
and 4.1nM respectively) [12].
Moreover, the IC50 values for parental K562 CML
cells (6nM) and Lama CML cells (1nM) were also in
good agreement with the one previously reported in the
literature (3.9 and 0.5nM, respectively) [12].

Ponatinib induces cell death in different TKI cell
lines
It is well established that TKIs induced different
types of cell death, including apoptosis in CML cell lines
[8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20]. Therefore, we next used Annexin V
and PI staining to assess cell death in Ba/F3 cells carrying
wild-type or mutated BCR-ABL proteins and in CML
cell lines treated with either a maximal dose of imatinib
or increasing concentrations of ponatinib. Ponatinib
was found to trigger apoptosis in both BaF3-WT and
BaF3-T315I cells and to a less extend in BaF3-G250E
cells (Figure 2A). Apoptosis induction by ponatinib was
confirmed by the cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase
(PARP), a caspase 3 substrate. Indeed, cleavage of PARP
in its 85kDa fragment was detected in the three BaF3
cell lines (Figure 2A). Imatinib (1uM) was shown to
significantly increased the number of Annexin V positive
cells, a hallmark of apoptosis, in the K562, JURLMK1 and
Lama CML cell lines, but not in their imatinib-resistant
counterparts (Figure 2B, C and D). Ponatinib (10-30nM)
was as efficient as 1uM imatinib to trigger apoptosis in the
three sensitive cell lines. Conversely to imatinib, ponatinib
was found to induce apoptosis in all three imatinibresistant cells lines, even though sensitivity to ponatinib
was lower in K562R and LamaR cells as compared to
JURLMK1R cells. Apoptosis induction by ponatinib
was confirmed by PARP cleavage in each sensitive and
resistant cell lines (Figure 2B, C and D).

RESULTS
The effect of ponatinib on the viability of several
imatinib-resistant cell lines was evaluated in comparison
with that of imatinib and dasatinib. Cell lines were
incubated for 48h with increasing concentrations of
imatinib, dasatinib or ponatinib and cell viability was
assessed using the XTT assay. We first investigated
the effect of these ITKs on the viability of murine Ba/
F3 cells, carrying wild type (WT) BCR-ABL, T315I or
G250E-BCR-ABL mutation. As shown in Figure 1A,
BaF3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL were highly
sensitive to imatinib, dasatinib and ponatinib, whereas
BaF3-T315I-BCR-ABL and BaF3-G250E-BCR-ABL
cells were resistant to both imatinib and dasatinib. By
contrast, ponatinib induced loss of cell viability in BaF3
cells carrying the T315I or G250E mutation, in agreement
with previous results from the literature [12, 18]. As
expected, imatinib-resistant K562, Lama and JURLMK1
cell lines were resistant to high doses of imatinib and
were also cross-resistant to dasatinib (Figure 1B, C and
D). However, the three resistant cell lines exhibited
high sensitivity to ponatinib, even though a higher
concentration of ponatinib was necessary to achieve an
equivalent loss of cell viability in sensitive versus resistant
CML cells. Globally, high doses of ponatinib (30nM)
efficiently killed all imatinib-resistant cell lines.

By contrast, BaF3 cells carrying the T315I or

JURLMK1R) the mechanism of resistance to imatinib
is not fully understood but the data reported here in
clearly show a constitutive activation of ERK1/2 also
in these cells [9, 11]. Nevertheless ponatinib inhibited
BCR-ABL phosphorylation and, to a less extent
CRKL phosphorylation (Figure 3B, C and D). Finally,
maintenance of ERK1/2 activation was detected in
JULMK1R and LamaR CML cells treated with ponatinib
as it is the case in K562R cells (Figure 3B and [9]).

explanation for the partial disconnection of BCR-ABL and
CRKL phosphorylation would be that in imatinib-resistant
cells, reactivation of other kinases including ERK1/2, Fyn
and/or Lyn [8, 10] contributes to the regulation of CRKL
phosphorylation independently on BCR-ABL. As higher
concentrations of ponatinib are required to inhibit SRC
kinases, this would bring a good explanation for the lesser
sensitivity of Imatinib-resistant cells to ponatinib. In line
with this hypothesis, we have previously reported that
a Lyn/ERK1/2 axis is required for imatinib-resistance
in K562 cells [9]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate
that the Lyn/ERK1/2 module could regulate CRKL
phosphorylation independently of BCR-ABL. This
hypothesis is reinforced by the observation that Lyn has
been shown to recruit CRKL in neutrophils [21].
In conclusion, we show here for the first time
that ponatinib is highly efficient to induce cell death in
different imatinib-resistant CML cell lines. Phase II
clinical trial evaluation of oral ponatinib in patients with
refractory CML and other hematologic malignancies are
ongoing. Our results suggest that in addition to T315I
patients, ponatinib could be widely used in resistant CML
patients, whatever the supposed mode of resistance to first
line ITKs.

Ponatinib is highly efficient on CD34+ cells but
not on PBMC from a CML patient at diagnosis
Finally, we assessed the effect of both imatinib
and ponatinib on CD34+ cells from two CML patients at
diagnosis. As expected Imatinib decreased CD34+ cell
viability but failed to affect the viability of PBMC from
the same patients. Ponatinib (30nM) was highly effective
on CD34+ cells from the same patients with only a minor
effect on PBMC at 30nM (Figure 4A). The effect of both
TKIs accounted for by increased apoptosis as judged by
AnnexinV/PI staining (Figure 4B). Finally both TKIs
exhibits potent anti-proliferative effects on CD34+ cells
as attested by a drastic loss of the ability of CD34+ to form
colonies in soft agar (Figure 4C).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DISCUSSION
Reagents and antibodies:

The findings described in the present study confirm
and extend the work previously reported by O’ Hare et al.
in sensitive CML cell lines and BaF3 cells carrying native
and mutated BCR-ABL [12]. However, our work is the
first to investigate the effect of three different TKIs on a
panel of imatinib-resistant cell lines. Our results indicate
that ponatinib is effective on all CML cell lines in vitro,
whatever the mode of resistance to imatinib. Interestingly,
in our hands the cells carrying the G250E mutation
seems less sensitive to the effect of ponatinib that the one
carrying the T315I mutation. Indeed, dephosphorylation
of BCR-ABL and CRKL by ponatinib is less effective in
BaF3 carrying the G250E mutation. This is consistent with
recent data from the literature that show an uncoupling
between the IC50 values for BaF3 cellular proliferation
assays and CRKL dephosphorylation by ponatinib [12].
Therefore, one interesting observation of the present study
is the partial disconnection between BCR-ABL and CRKL
phosphorylation.
CRKL is a direct substrate of BCR-ABL and
therefore the status of CRKL phosphorylation is sought
to be a reflect of the one of BCR-ABL. Although
dephosphorylation of BCR-ABL by ponatinib was
nearly complete at 10-30nM, only a higher concentration

Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) was
purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY,
USA), and Dasatinib and Ponatinib were purchased from
Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). RPMI 1640 medium,
IMDM medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from
life technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sodium fluoride,
sodium orthovanadate, phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin were purchased SigmaAldrich (France). Anti-HSP60 and anti-ERK antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). HRP conjugated anti-mouse and anti-goat
antibodies were from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark).
Anti-PARP, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-CRKL, anti-phosphoCRKL, anti-ABL, anti-phospho-ABL and peroxydaseconjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).

Cell lines:
Human CML cell lines K562, Lama, and
JURLMK-1 were grown at 37°C under 5% CO2 in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50
μg/ml streptomycin, and 1mM sodium pyruvate. K562,
Lama and JURLMK-1 cells imatinib-resistant have been
described earlier [8, 11]. The BaF3 p210 BCR ABL WT,

from CML patients were grown at 37°C under 5% CO2 in
IMDM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 15% BIT (BSA
Insulin Transferin) (Stem Cell Technologies), 100 ng/ml
SCF, 100 ng/ml IL6 and 10 ng/ml IL3 were purchased
from Miltenyi Biotec.

Cell viability:
Cells (15x103 cells/100ml) were incubated in
a 96 well plate with different effectors for the times
indicated in the figure legends. Fifty microliters of
sodium 3-[1-phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate
(XTT) reagent was added to each well. The assay is based
on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt XTT to
form an orange formazan dye by metabolically active
cells. The absorbance of the formazan product, reflecting
cell viability, was measured at 490 nm. Each assay was
performed in quadruplicate.
