ABSTRACT
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in colorectal cancer.
Previous studies showed that 5-FU modulates RNA metabolism and mRNA expression.
In addition, it has been reported that 5-FU incorporates into the RNAs constituting the
translational machinery and that 5-FU affects the amount of some mRNAs associated
with ribosomes. However, the impact of 5-FU on translational regulation remains unclear.
Using translatome profiling, we report that a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU induces
a translational reprogramming in colorectal cancer cell lines. Comparison of mRNA
distribution between polysomal and non-polysomal fractions in response to 5-FU treatment
using microarray quantification identified 313 genes whose translation was selectively
regulated. These regulations were mostly stimulatory (91%). Among these genes, we
showed that 5-FU increases the mRNA translation of HIVEP2, which encodes a transcription
factor whose translation in normal condition is known to be inhibited by mir-155. In
response to 5-FU, the expression of mir-155 decreases thus stimulating the translation of
HIVEP2 mRNA. Interestingly, the 5-FU-induced increase in specific mRNA translation was
associated with reduction of global protein synthesis. Altogether, these findings indicate
that 5-FU promotes a translational reprogramming leading to the increased translation of a
subset of mRNAs that involves at least for some of them, miRNA-dependent mechanisms.
This study supports a still poorly evaluated role of translational control in drug response.

proteins, translational control contributes to tumor initiation,
invasion and metastasis. In contrast, the role of translational
control in anti-cancer drug response is just starting to emerge
and large-scale analysis of the translatome has been carried
out for only a few anti-cancer drugs [3-6].

Among the drugs commonly used in chemotherapy,
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an anti-metabolite widely given in
first-line of treatment in many types of solid cancers. For a
long time, the 5-FU-induced cytotoxic effects were thought
to result exclusively from its impact on DNA metabolism, in
particular from 5-FU-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and
induction of DNA damage [7]. However, several evidences
indicate that the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU also results from
its capacity to alter RNA metabolism and mRNA expression
[7]. 5-FU can be incorporated into all species of RNAs after
its conversion into fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) and
media complementation with uridine, which allowed recovery
of normal RNA metabolism, compensate most of the 5-FUinduced cytotoxic effects [8-11]. Furthermore, exposure to
5-FU promotes a profound transcriptional reprogramming
leading to modification of mRNA and miRNAs expression
profiles that contributes in modifying cell fate [12-14].
Although 5-FU directly alters RNA metabolism and
mRNA expression, the impact of 5-FU on translation has yet
been poorly characterized. Several evidences indicate that
5-FU could alter translation. It has been shown that 5-FU
affects processing and functions of two components of the
translational machinery, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer
RNA (tRNA) [15-18]. Moreover, genome-wide screening in
yeast revealed that rRNA and tRNA processing factors mediate
a part of 5-FU cytotoxicity [19-22]. Finally, two large-scale
studies showed that 5-FU could regulate the translational
output of a set of mRNAs [23, 24]. For some of these mRNAs,
their global expression levels were not strongly affected by
5-FU, while their abundance in the polysomal fractions (i.e.
ribosome-bound mRNAs) was modulated. Although these data
raised the possibility that their translational efficiency might be
regulated by 5-FU, it was not clearly addressed in these studies.
Therefore, the regulation of translational efficiency by 5-FU
has not been determined on a large-scale, and the molecular
mechanisms mediating such regulations were not determined.
In the present study, to investigate whether
treatment with a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU affects
the translational efficiency of specific mRNAs, we
performed a genome-wide analysis of the translatome by
comparing the distribution of mRNAs within polysomes
(actively translated RNAs) and non-polysomes (free nontranslated and poorly translated mRNAs) in a panel of
colorectal cancer cells treated by 5-FU. This approach
showed that 5-FU induces a translational reprogramming,
characterized by an increased translational efficiency of
specific genes that was mediated, at least in part, through
5-FU-modulation of miRNA expression.

and metabolic activity. Cell response to increasing
concentrations of 5-FU was monitored in real-time for
72 hrs using electrical impedance-derived technology
(Figure 1A) [25]. Compared to non-treated cells, two
different kinetics of 5-FU response were observed
depending on the dose. At 100 μM and 500 µM, 5-FU
induced a decrease of impedance signal from 24 hrs posttreatment. At these doses, a significant reduction of total
cell number and an increase in the percentage of dead
cells were also observed (Figures 1B-1C). In response
to 10 μM of 5-FU, the decrease of impedance signal was
delayed by 24 hrs (Figure 1A). In this condition, the total
cell number remained stable between 24 and 48 hrs posttreatment and no significant change in the percentage of
dead cell was observed (Figures 1B-1C), while the 5-FU
treatment was effective as soon as after 4 hrs of exposure
as shown by the increased expression of the stress sensor
p53 (Supplementary Figure 1A). These data showed that,
compared to 100 µM and 500 µM, cytotoxicity in response
to 10 μM of 5-FU was delayed, as cells were still viable at
24 and 48 hrs post-treatment.
To determine whether HCT-116 cells treated with
different doses of 5-FU retained a metabolic activity at 24
hrs and 48 hrs, we performed MTS assays (Figure 1D).
Cells treated with 100 μM and 500 μM of 5-FU showed a
strong decrease of their metabolic activity. In contrast, a
slight but significant increase in metabolic activity 24 hrs
post-treatment was observed in 10 µM 5-FU treated cells,
followed by a decrease back to their initial level by 48
hrs of treatment. Altogether, these data indicated that cells
exposed to 10 μM of 5-FU remained viable and retained
metabolic activity even at 48 hrs post-treatment.

5-FU reduces global protein synthesis
Before analyzing specific changes in translation that
occur in response to 5-FU in viable cells retaining metabolic
activity, we determined whether HCT-116 cells treated with
10 µM of 5-FU maintained their capacity to synthesize
proteins. Using 35S pulse-labeling experiments, we
compared levels of global protein synthesis between nontreated cells (NT) and cells exposed to 10 µM of 5-FU for
24 hrs (Figure 2A). Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment was
used as a positive control of complete inhibition of global
protein synthesis. 35S quantification revealed a decrease of
about 20% of the global level of protein synthesis in treated
cells compared to non-treated cells (Figures 2A-2B).
We then compared polysome profiles through
sucrose gradients from non-treated cells and cells
treated with 10 μM of 5-FU (Figures 2C-2D). Typical
polysome profiles were obtained for non-treated and
treated HCT-116 cells using both real-time absorbance
detection and RNA visualization on agarose gel. The
total quantity of 40S, 60S subunits, 80S monosomes
and polysomes for a given amount of cytosolic extract
was decreased in 5-FU treated cells. In particular, the

60S subunits and the monosomes 80S were drastically
decreased. Using 32P pulse labeling, we confirmed that
levels of ribosome decreased in 5-FU-treated cells
compared to non-treated ones, and that 60S and 80S
are more prone to reduction than 40S (data not shown).
This decrease in ribosomes quantity is concordant
with the reduction of ribosome production previously
described in response to 5-FU [15, 18, 21]. Reduction in
ribosome production in response to 5-FU was probably
partly responsible for the decrease of global protein
synthesis (Figures 2A-2B). These data showed that
HCT-116 cells exposed to 10 µM of 5-FU for 24 hrs

retained the capability to synthesize proteins although
the global protein synthesis rate was reduced.

5-FU promotes association of a subset of mRNAs
with polysomes
Because global protein synthesis was slightly decreased
but still highly effective in response to 10 µM of 5-FU for 24
hrs in HCT-116 cells, we investigated whether this treatment
induced a modulation of the translational efficiency of some
specific mRNAs using translatome profiling, a widely used
method [26]. We used a three-steps process that allows
determining the variation of distribution of each cytosolic

treatment. Cells were treated 24 hrs post-seeding with increasing concentrations of 5-FU. The cell index (CI) relating change in cell
number and attachment was monitored every 15 min for 72 hrs using the xCELLigence System and normalized to the starting time of
5-FU treatment. Delay in cytotoxicity is induced by 10 µM of 5-FU compared to 100 µM or 500 µM. This graph represents mean values

to 100 μM and 500 μM of 5-FU promotes drastic decrease in total cell numbers and increase in cell death, while exposition to 10 μM of
5-FU showed no impact on cell death. (D) Metabolic activity of HCT-116 cells in response to 5-FU treatment. Cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of 5-FU and metabolic activity was analyzed using MTS assays at different time points. Compared to non-treated

with 10 μM of 5-FU. Graphs present means and SD of at least three independent experiments. *: P < 0.05; **: P < 0.01; ***: P < 0.001.

mRNA in non-polysomal fractions (NP, including free
non-translated and poorly translated RNAs) and polysomal
fractions (P, including actively translated RNAs) (Figures 2C2D and Supplementary Figure 2A). First, for every gene, the
detection of mRNA in non-polysomal (NP) and polysomal
(P) fractions was assessed in non-treated and 5-FU treated
cells using DNA microarray. Second, in each condition, the
relative distribution of a given mRNA between NP and P

fractions was estimated by calculating the ratio of the probe
signal obtained for the P fraction to the NP fraction. Third,
comparison of mRNA distribution between non-treated and
treated cells was performed by calculating the translational
index (TI), which represents the variation of the distribution
of a particular mRNA between NP and P in response to 5-FU
treatment. Thus, for each mRNA, the TI reflects the foldchange of its translation efficiency in response to 5-FU.

Two independent experiments were performed using
this approach to determine change in TI in 10 µM 5-FU
treated cells compared to non-treated cells. The probe
intensities issued from the two biological replicates were
significantly correlated supporting the robustness of this
translatome profiling (Supplementary Figures 2B-2E).
Globally, 12,131 genes were commonly detected in both
non-treated and treated conditions (Supplementary Figure
2F). These common genes were used to analyze changes
in translation efficiency in response to 5-FU by calculating
the translational index (TI). By applying cut-off values of
1.5 and P-value < 0.05 to the TI of the 12,131 common
genes [27], we identified 313 genes (2.6%) whose TI was
significantly changed in response to 10 µM of 5-FU for
24 hrs in HCT-116 cells (Figure 3A and Supplementary
Table 1). These data indicated that 5-FU treatment altered
translation efficiency of some mRNAs. Among them, 29
were translationally down-regulated (9%) while 284 were
up-regulated (91%). The range of TI varied from -1.5 to
-2.5 and from 1.5 to 2.9 (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Table 2). In particular, 25 genes displayed a TI above 2,
indicating that 5-FU treatment induces a 2-fold increase
in polysome association of some mRNAs (Table 1). Using
lower or higher cut-off values (TI: 1.3 or 2.0), we observed
that up-regulation of translation efficiency was always
much more frequent than down-regulation (Supplementary
Table 1). Thus, gene-specific modulation of translational
efficiency in response to 10 µM of 5-FU for 24 hrs in
HCT-116 cells corresponded mainly to stimulation (for
genes list see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2).
Validation was performed by calculating the TI
of 11 genes, which were selected on the basis of the
significance and the absolute values of their TI measured
using microarray. RT-qPCR were performed on HCT-116
NP and P fractions that were used for microarrays analyses
(two independent replicates) and from two additional
independent experiments. Compared to microarray data,
similar up- and down-regulation of TI were observed in
the panel of 11 genes analyzed by RT-qPCR (Figure 4A).
A difference in the range of TI was observed between
the two methods that can be explained by a difference in
sensibility of these methods. However, a significant and
positive correlation was observed between TI obtained
from RT-qPCR and microarray analyses (Figure 4B).
Similar analyses using RT-qPCR quantification of mRNA
distribution within polysome profiles were performed in
two additional colorectal cancer cells (Figure 4C). We
used the p53-null HCT-116 cells and the mutant p53.
R273H HT-29 cells (Supplementary Figure 1, IARC
TP53 Database), to determine whether this translational
regulation occurs in different colorectal cancer cell
lines and whether it is dependent of p53 since several
data support a role of p53 as a regulator of translational
reprogramming [28]. Like in HCT-116 cells, TI of a panel
of 7 genes were either reduced or increased in response to
5-FU in these two cell lines, similarly to what observed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in HCT-116 cells. Of note only 3 genes in HT-29 did not
show variation in their TI. Interestingly, since similar
pattern of TI was observed in wild-type p53 HCT-116
cells, p53-null HCT-116 cells and mutant p53.R273H HT29 cells, it appeared that changes in TI of each mRNA
revealed by the translatome profiling are independent
of p53. Altogether, the validation procedure performed
on different genes in several cell lines confirmed that
5-FU treatment at 10 µM for 24 hrs reduced or increased
the association of a subset of mRNAs with polysomes,
indicating respectively either a reduction or an increase in
translational efficiency of some mRNAs.
To decipher whether alteration in translational
efficiency directly resulted from 5-FU treatment or
from 5-FU-induced change in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, we quantified the levels of
total and cytosolic mRNAs in response to 24 hrs of 10
µM 5-FU treatment in HCT-116 p53-null and HT-29 cells
(Supplementary Figure 3). No concordance was observed
between 5-FU-induced transcriptional, post-transcriptional
and translational variation, as confirmed by correlation
analyses. These data suggest that 5-FU alters translational
efficiency independently of any change at mRNA levels.
Finally, no change in TI analyzed in cytosolic lystates
was observed in HCT-116 cells treated for 4 hrs by 10
µM 5-FU while increased in cytosolic mRNA levels
were observed (Supplementary Figure 4). Once again,
no concordance between transcriptional and translational
events was observed at early time point although 5-FU
affects more rapidly transcriptional regulatory events than
the translational ones.
Altogether, our data showed that 5-FU treatment at
10 µM for 24 hrs alters the translatome independently of
any transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of
the targeted mRNA. In addition, 5-FU mainly increases
the translation efficiency of a subset of mRNAs.

Genes involved in DNA replication and gene
expression regulation are selectively regulated by
5-FU at the translation level
To determine the main functions of genes whose
recruitment whithin polysomes was altered in response
to 5-FU in HCT-116 cells, we performed Gene Ontology
analysis using the Functional annotation clustering
analytic modules of DAVID bioinformatics resources
that provides a rank classification of enriched functions
based on determination of P-values and enrichment
scores [29]. Statistical enrichment analyses were
performed separately on genes translationally up- and
down-regulated, using the lists of 313 (TI cut-off of
1.5, P < 0.05) and 798 (TI cut-off of 1.3, P < 0.05)
translationally dysregulated genes. Clusters of functional
annotation common to both lists are presented in Figure
5 (for a complete list of functional annotation clustering,
see Supplementary Table 3).

Using this approach, only one functional cluster
was identified for the genes whose translation efficiency
was down-regulated in response to 5-FU treatment.
This cluster contained 5 of the 29 translationally downregulated genes (17%). It was composed of genes involved
in DNA replication, such as ASF1B or TBCD (Figure
5 and Supplementary Table 3). These data suggested
that 5-FU reduced the translation efficiency of mRNAs
involved in DNA replication.
Genes whose translation efficiency was up-regulated
by 5-FU clustered into five groups showing enrichment
scores ranging from 1.7 to 4.9 (Figure 5). The group which
displayed the most significant P-value and the highest
enrichment score, contained genes encoding zinc finger
proteins, including several ZNF family members and
HIVEP2 (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 3). These

proteins are mainly involved in transcription regulation. A
second cluster closely related to the transcription process
(cluster 3) was enriched in genes coding proteins with
B-box domains. These data suggest that 5-FU treatment
selectively increases the translation efficiency of a subset of
mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators. Translationally
up-regulated genes were also enriched in genes involved
in translation and translational regulation. Indeed, clusters
2 and 4 contained genes involved in translation initiation
and elongation (EIF3F, EIF3E…) and in production of the
translational machinery, including ribosome components
(RPL13…) and tRNA maturation factors. Altogether, these
data showed that genes whose translation efficiency was
up-regulated in response to 5-FU treatment for 24 hrs were
mainly involved in regulation of gene expression, including
transcription and translation.

each in duplicates), 2.6% (n=313) were significantly deregulated at translational levels (TI cut-off = 1.5, P < 0.05). Among these

experiments. (B) Distribution of the Translational Index (TI). Among the 313 genes significantly deregulated at translational levels, TI

5-FU induces translational up-regulation of
HIVEP2 mRNA through down-regulation of
mir-155

cell lines (Figures 3B, 4A, 4C and 6A). We determined
whether this change in HIVEP2 mRNA translation was
paralleled with a change in mRNA and protein levels in
HCT-116 cells. RT-qPCR analysis showed a significant
40% decrease of HIVEP2 mRNA levels in both total and
cytosolic extracts in response to 5-FU treatment (Figure
6B). In parallel, a significant 1.5-fold increase in HIVEP2
protein levels was observed in response to 5-FU treatment
(Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure 5A). These data
demonstrated that despite the decrease of HIVEP2 mRNA
levels in response to 5-FU, the selective increase in its
translational efficiency led to an increase in HIVEP2
protein levels.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms
contributing to the modulation of translational efficiency
of specific mRNA in response to 5-FU treatment, we
focused our attention on HIVEP2 mRNA, one of the most
translationally deregulated genes (Figure 3B). Indeed,
our translatome profiling and validation process showed
that the distribution of HIVEP2 mRNA was significantly
increased in polysomes compared to non-polysomes in
response to 5-FU in a panel of three colorectal cancer

miRNAs reduce mRNA translation by direct
interaction with specific mRNAs that is a pre-requisite
for subsequent mRNA degradation [30, 31]. HIVEP2
mRNA was previously identified as a direct target of mir155 [32]. We thus wondered whether mir-155 expression
may be regulated by 5-FU, thereby participating in the
stimulation of HIVEP2 mRNA translational efficiency.
In HCT-116 cells, quantification of mir-155 expression
by RT-qPCR showed a significant reduction of 50% in
response to 5-FU treatment for 24 hrs (Figure 6D). Thus,
by decreasing mir-155 expression, 5-FU could counteract
mir-155-mediated inhibition of HIVEP2 translation and
thus promote HIVEP2 mRNA translation. Interestingly,
reduction in mir-155 levels was observed from 4 hrs

(Supplementary Figure 5B), suggesting a direct effect of
5-FU on mir-155 expression. To determine the effect of
mir-155 on HIVEP2 mRNA translation, we performed
3’UTR luciferase reporter assays using HIVEP2 3’UTR
reporter. Over-expression of mir-155 in the absence of
5-FU significantly reduced the Firefly/Renilla luciferase
activity ratio of the HIVEP2 3’UTR reporter and of the
positive control BACH1 3’UTR reporter while it had no
impact on a 3’UTR-less negative control (Supplementary
Figure 5C) [32]. Using this system, we assessed the role
of HIVEP2 3’UTR and mir-155 expression in the increase
in HIVEP2 mRNA translation in response to 5-FU
treatment (Figure 6E). In the absence of transient mir-155
over-expression (mir-CTL condition), 5-FU treatment

significantly increased the Firefly/Renilla luciferase
activity ratio of the HIVEP2 3’UTR reporter. Importantly,
this increase in luciferase activity was not paralleled
with a variation in luciferase mRNA levels (Figure 6F).
These data suggested that increase in luciferase activity
results from change in translation rather than change in
transcription of the chimeric Firefly Luciferase – HIVEP2
3’UTR. Thus, HIVEP2 mRNA translation in response
to 5-FU treatment was, at least in part, related to the
3’UTR of HIVEP2 mRNA. In 5-FU treated cells, mir-155
expression was then restored using an expression vector
(Figure 6E). Restoration of mir-155 expression reduces
the induction of Firefly/Renilla luciferase activity ratio
in 5-FU treated cells. In addition, no significant change
in the luciferase mRNA levels was observed, indicating
that restoration of mir-155 in 5-FU treated cells inhibits
translation without affecting transcriptional expression
of the luciferase reporter assay (Figure 6F). Interestingly,
similar reduction in mir-155 expression from 4 hrs posttreatment and in mir-155-dependent HIVEP2 translation
in response to 5-FU was observed in p53-null HCT-116
cells, indicating a p53-independent effect (Supplementary
Figure 6). Thus, over-expression of mir-155 was sufficient
to inhibit the increase in HIVEP2 mRNA translation that
was induced by 5-FU. Altogether, these data showed that
the alteration of mir-155 in response to 5-FU mediated a
translational regulation of the HIVEP2 mRNA.
To determine whether mir-155 may have a broader
role in translational regulation in response to 5-FU
treatment, we first analyzed the enrichment of mir-155

target genes among the genes whose translation efficiency
was altered by 5-FU treatment in HCT-116 cells, using
a list of 719 experimentally validated mir-155 target
genes (miRTarBase [33]) (Figure 6G and Supplementary
Table 4). Interestingly, a significant enrichment in mir155 target genes was observed among the translationally
up-regulated genes (Up) when compared to the whole
genome (Up vs Microarray, P = 0.0389), while no
enrichment of mir-155 target genes was found among the
genes translationally down-regulated by 5-FU (Down vs
Microarray, P = 0.3088). As shown in Figure 6G, 19 of
the genes that were translationally up-regulated by 5-FU
corresponded to mir-155 target genes (6.7%). We validated
the translationnally up-regulation of a panel of mir-155
target genes in response to 5-FU in HCT-116 p53-null and
HT-29 cells. Although the kinetic of mir-155 expression
in response to 5-FU exhibited opposite variation at
24 hrs in HT-29 compared to the isogenic HCT-116
cellular model while this kinetic remained similar at 4
hrs (Supplementary Figures 5B, 6A and 7), the three cell
lines showed a comparable tendency to translationally upregulation of mir-155 target genes in response to 5-FU
(Supplementary Figure 8). These data suggest that the
early down-regulation of mir-155 in response to 5-FU
treatment may contribute to the increased translation of a
subset of mRNAs in colorectal cancer cells. Interestingly,
Gene Ontology analysis of these mir-155 target genes
whose translation was up-regulated in response to 5-FU
mainly corresponded to proteins involved in transcription
(Supplementary Table 5).

Figure 5: Gene ontology analysis of translationally deregulated genes in 5-FU treated HCT-116 cells. GO enrichment
was determined using the Functional annotation clustering tools from DAVID. Translationally up-regulated genes are mainly involved
in transcription and translation, while translationally down-regulated genes are involved in DNA replication. Only the 3 first terms were
shown for all clusters identified (up-regulation: 5 clusters; down-regulation: 1 cluster). For complete data see Supplementary Table 3.

DISCUSSION

several genes including HIVEP2. Change in transcription
can thus not explain the observed change in translation.
Several mechanisms can explain the change in translational
control of only a subset of transcripts in response to 5-FU.
Such modulation in translational efficiency can result for
example from 5-FU-induced alteration of expression of
factors involved in translational control such as proteins or
miRNAs [2]. Our data showed that 5-FU-induced change
in translational efficiently occurred independently of the
p53 protein, a stress sensor known to regulate translation
through numerous mechanisms [28]. Our data rather
identified mir-155 as a common regulator of 5-FU-mediated
alteration of translational efficiency for several target genes.
We indeed showed that reduction of mir-155
in response to 5-FU can promote HIVEP2 mRNA
translation in HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells. In addition,
determination of the molecular mechanism by which
5-FU regulates HIVEP2 also supports that 5-FU regulates
translation efficiency. Indeed, cell exposure to low doses
of 5-FU decreases HIVEP2 mRNA levels in both total
and cytosolic fractions while in the same time, HIVEP2
mRNA is concentrated in the actively translated polysomal
fractions, and HIVEP2 protein levels are increased in 5-FU
treated cells. Moreover, our data reveal that increased
translation of HIVEP2 mRNA in response to 5-FU results
from abolition of mir-155-mediated inhibition of HIVEP2
mRNA translation. By reducing mir-155 expression, 5-FU
promotes translation of HIVEP2 mRNA. This observation
is in accordance with the repressing role of miRNAs,
which have been shown to inhibit translational regulation
before inducing mRNA degradation – inhibition, which
can be removed by reducing miRNA expression [30, 31].
Furthermore, we showed and validated that mir-155 target
genes are enriched in genes translationally up-regulated,
establishing that reduction in mir-155 levels in response
to 5-FU could explain about 7% of the translationally
up-regulated gene. Interestingly, plasmatic mir-155
expression levels were found to be decreased after 5-FUbased chemotherapy exposure of colorectal cancer cells’
patients [40]. miRNA regulation is likely a more general
mechanism leading to alteration of translation in response
to 5-FU, because miRNA profiling identified several
miRNAs, whose expression is either up- or down-regulated
in response to 5-FU [12, 14, 41]. However, until now, these
changes in miRNA expression levels have not been linked
to alteration of translation. Additional mechanisms remain
to be explored to explain the translational control of a
specific subset of mRNAs in response to 5-FU treatment. In
particular, the impact of 5-FU incorporation into RNAs of
the translational machinery on translational control remains
to be investigated.
We show that the selective translation of mRNAs in
response to 5-FU is accompanied by a decrease in global
protein synthesis. This reduction in protein synthesis could
result from the previously described reduction in pre-rRNA
processing in response to 5-FU since a strict correlation

The anti-metabolite 5-FU has been shown to alter
gene expression at transcriptional and splicing levels and
to alter the translation machinery, mainly by affecting the
processing and functions of rRNA and tRNA [15, 18, 19,
21, 22]. However, the impact of 5-FU on translational
control remained unclear. Using translatome profiling,
we show here for the first time that 5-FU induces a
translational reprogramming since, while reducing the
global protein synthesis, 5-FU increases translation of a
subset of mRNAs, at least in part through miRNA-based
mechanisms.
As already reported, we identify two kinetics of
cellular response to 5-FU [7]. While high doses of 5-FU
exposure result in drastic and rapid cytotoxic effects,
low doses, which correspond to doses used in the clinic
[34, 35], promote delay in cytotoxicity. In particular,
cells exposed to 10 μM of 5-FU for 24 hrs remain
viable and metabolically active, and keep their capacity
to synthesize proteins. By comparing mRNA levels in
polysomal (translated mRNAs) and non-polysomal (free
and poorly translated mRNAs) fractions using DNA
microarray [26], we demonstrate that low doses of 5-FU
specifically alter the translation efficiency of about 300
mRNAs. Importantly, the validation procedure performed
on different genes in a panel of three colorectal cancer cell
lines confirmed that 5-FU treatment alters the association
of some mRNAs with polysomes. By analyzing the
abundance of mRNAs in polysomal fractions using
genome-wide approaches two previous studies have
suggested that 5-FU affects translation [23, 24]. However,
since no normalization to non-polysomal fraction or total
RNA was done in these studies, alteration of translation
efficiency was not directly addressed in these studies. In
addition, both studies had potential bias. Indeed, one of
these studies used colorectal cancer cells with decreased
or increased expression of thymidylate synthase, a key
mediator of 5-FU cytotoxicity, thus complicating the
analysis of the direct impact of 5-FU on translation [7,
23]. The second study used Hsp70 immunoprecipitation
to purify ribosomes presenting newly synthesized proteins
[24]. This approach may suffer from several biases since
Hsp70 was recently reported to bind RNA, Hsp70 is not
required for newly synthesized small proteins, and Hsp70
levels are reduced in response to 5-FU [36-39].
Our data indicate that exposure to 5-FU promotes
increase in translational efficiency of only a subset of
mRNAs. It appeared that the 5-FU-induced change
in translation efficiency obtained in our experimental
conditions is independent of any transcriptional and posttranscriptional modulation induced by 5-FU treatment in
a panel of three colorectal cancer cell lines. Indeed, we
showed that, although change in translation efficiency
is not an early event, modulation of translation does not
correlate with modulation of transcription, as shown for

occurs between the rate of ribosome biogenesis and protein
synthesis [18, 42, 43]. Therefore, the concomitant decrease
in global protein synthesis and increase in translation of
a selected subset of mRNAs indicate that 5-FU promotes
translational reprogramming in colorectal cancer cells.
In conclusion, in the present study we provide a
novel mechanism, which supports the importance of
translational control in 5-FU-induced cellular response.
Overall, our data indicate that low doses of 5-FU promote
translational reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells. The
gene-specific stimulation of translation induced by 5-FU
involves at least in part miRNA-dependent translational
regulation. However, additional mechanisms remain to
be investigated in the future. Altogether, our data add to
the growing body of evidences that support the direct
contribution of translation in establishing anti-cancer drug
response as well as potential treatment failures.

Preparation of mRNA-associated polysomes
Cells were seeded at 107 cell/15 cm dish and treated
for 24 hrs with 5-FU. Cells were then incubated for 15 min
with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) and washed twice
with cold 1X PBS-100 μg/ml CHX before harvesting.
Cytosolic lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mM
KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 4.5%
sucrose, 0.5 mM DTE and 100 μg/ml CHX) using dounce
homogenizer and two successive 10 min centrifugations at
4°C at 1,000 and 12,000 x g. Ten-40% sucrose gradients
were prepared using four solutions (10%, 20%, 30%
and 40% of sucrose dissolved in lysis buffer) that were
introduced one by one in increased concentration order
after 30 min at -80°C in Ultra-Clear Tube 9/16 x 3 ½
(Beckman). One mg of cytosolic proteins was loaded
onto a sucrose gradient defrozen overnight at 4°C and
sedimented by ultra-centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 2
hrs at 4°C using SW41 rotor on L7-55 ultracentrifuge
(Beckman). The gradients were collected in 18 fractions
and absorbance profiles were generated at 254 nm using
an ISCO UA-6 detector. RNA quality of the different
fractions was checked on agarose gel. Non-polysomal
or polysomal fractions were pooled for further RNA
extraction using Trizol LS Reagent as described by the
manufacturer (Life technologies).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human colorectal cancer HCT-116 and HT-29 cells
were obtained from ATCC (CCL-247, HTB-38). Cells were
maintained in DMEM-glutaMAX supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life technologies)
at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
was kindly provided by Centre Léon Bérard (purchased at
Sanofi-Aventis), stored at room temperature at 384 mM in
sterile water and diluted in cell culture medium.

Cell proliferation and viability
Real-time cell behavior was monitored using
xCELLigence RTCA system (Roche), which allows
label-free and dynamic monitoring of cells by measuring
electrical impedance. 105 cells were seeded in 96 E-plates
(Roche) 24 hrs prior 5-FU treatments. RTCA system
displays the measurements of impedance signal as Cell
Index (CI) values, providing quantitative information about
the different biological status of the cells including number,
viability, proliferation and mobility. CI values curves were
normalized to the time point of 5-FU administration. MTS
were performed at different time points on 105 cells seeded
into 96 well-plate 24 hrs prior 5-FU treatments using Cell
Titer Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assays as
described by the manufacturer (Promega). Cell viability
and total cell numbers were quantified in response to 5-FU
treatment by trypan blue staining method using Cedex XS
analyzer (Roche) from 150.105 cells seeded in 24 wellplates 24 hrs prior 5-FU treatment.

Affymetrix exon-array
Quality of RNA purified from polysome
fractionation was verified using BioAnalyzer (Agilent)
(RIN ranging from 6.6 to 9.3). 250 ng of total RNA was
processed with the GeneChip WT Sense Target Labeling
kit and hybridized to GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST
arrays. Affymetrix exon-array data were normalized with
quantile normalization. Antigenomic probes were used to
perform the background correction. Only probes targeting
exons annotated from full-length cDNA were retained
for analysis. Cross hybridizing probes and probes with
lower signals intensity than anti-genomic background
probes showing the same GC content were removed. Only
probes with a DABG P-value ≤ 0.05 in at least half of
the arrays were considered for further statistical analysis.

Global protein synthesis
Cells were plated 72 hrs before labeling in normal
medium and treated with 10 µM 5-FU for 24 hrs before

Arrays were performed in two independent replicates.
The median intensity of all constitutive exonic probes
was calculated for each gene in each sample, and the
experimental samples and control groups were compared
using a Student’s paired t-test. The adopted strategy to
identify the translationally regulated genes depends on
calculating the translational index (TI) (Supplementary
Figure 2A). First the ratios of active mRNAs (polysomal
fraction P) to inactive mRNAs (non-polysomal fraction
NP) was calculated for both 5-FU treated and nontreated cells. Then the translational index (5-FU P/NP)/
(Control P/NP) presents the translational changes for
each individual transcript. List of genes significantly
deregulated at translational levels was determined using
Student’s paired t-test (P < 0.05) and TI cut-off (1.3, 1.5
or 2) that are classical values used in translatome analyses
[27]. Gene ontology was performed on gene lists using
the online DAVID tools using Functional annotation
clustering analytic modules that performed dedicated
statistical analysis [29]. The Affymetrix exon-array data
reported in this article have been deposited in NCBI’s
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession
number GSE77180).

of total proteins were separated on a 12 % SDS-PAGE and
transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus. Membranes were saturated with 5%
milk and incubated with mouse monoclonoal antibodies
against HIVEP2 (ab70599, AbCam), p53 (DO-1, ab1101,
AbCam) and Ku80 (ab87860, AbCam). Detection was
performed with the secondary anti-mouse antibody
(A4416, Sigma) with Clarity Western ECL substrat kit
using ChemiDoc Imager (BioRad).

Luciferase reporter assays
500 ng of either miRNA control plasmid (pMSCVpuro-GFP-mir-CTL) or miR-155 expression vector
(pMSCV-puro-GFP-mir-155) was co-transfected with 200
ng of either HIVEP2 reporter plasmid (pMIR-REPORTdCMV 3’ UTR HIVEP2) or control reporter plasmid
(pMIR-REPORT-dCMV) into HCT-116 or HCT-116
p53-null cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s procedure. Firefly luciferase
activity was used to monitor 3’UTR activity while Renilla
luciferase activity was used as a control of transfection
efficiency. 105 cells were seeded 24 hrs prior transfection
and were treated with 5-FU 24 hrs post-transfection for
additional 24 hrs before analyzing luciferase activity using
Dual Reporter Luciferase Assays (Promega). The plasmids
are a kind gift of Dr. Erik K. Flemington laboratory.

Real-time quantitative RT-qPCR
The Affymetrix exon-array was validated by RTqPCR using RNA purified from the two polysomal profiles
used for the exon-array analyses and from four additional
and independent polysomal profiles. Three criteria have
been used to select genes for validation: a significant
difference in mRNA distribution within polysomal and
non-polysomal fractions between non-treated and 5-FUtreated cells; a Translational Index (TI) corresponding to the
highest TI variations; and a mix of translationnally up- and
down-regulated genes. 250 ng of total RNA were reverse
transcribed using the M-MLV RT kit and random primers
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using
the Light cycler 480 II real-time PCR thermocycler (Roche).
Expression of mRNAs was quantified using LightCycler 480
SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche) (Supplementary Table
6) and normalized using GAPDH expression according to
the 2-ΔΔCt method. Reverse transcription of miRNAs was
performed using TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit (no. 4366596,
Life Technologies). miRNA RT-qPCR was carried out using
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
The expression of mature miR-155 and RNU6B was
assessed using qPCR primer sets (Life Technologies, cat.no.
4427975-002623 and 4427975-001093, respectively).

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.0a (GraphPad Software, Inc). Mean comparison
was performed using Student t-test. Correlation between
translational index (TI) issued from DNA microarrays
and RT-qPCR was tested using the non-parametric
Spearman r test. Enrichment of mir-155 target genes was
investigated by Chi-square test. All P-values corresponded
to two-tailed P-values. P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Statistical results are given on the
graphs using conventional annotations: *: P<0.05; **:
P<0.01; ***: P<0.001.
