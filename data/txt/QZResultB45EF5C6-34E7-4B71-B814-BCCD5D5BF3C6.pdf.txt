Abstract
Agents that target components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are under
investigation for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Given the
highly heterogeneous nature of DLBCL, it is not clear whether all subtypes of DLBCL
will be susceptible to PI3K pathway inhibition, or which kinase within this pathway
is the most favorable target. Pharmacological profiling of a panel of DLBCL cell lines
revealed a subset of DLBCL that was resistant to AKT inhibition. Strikingly, sensitivity
to AKT inhibitors correlated with the ability of these inhibitors to block phosphorylation
of S6K1 and ribosomal protein S6. Cell lines resistant to AKT inhibition activated S6K1
independent of AKT either through upregulation of PIM2 or through activation by B
cell receptor (BCR) signaling components. Finally, combined inhibition of AKT and
BTK, PIM2, or S6K1 proved to be an effective strategy to overcome resistance to AKT
inhibition in DLBCL.

INTRODUCTION

in GCB-DLBCL both as monotherapy [12] and in
combination with the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat [13].
Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling through restoration of
PTEN expression was also effective in GCB-DLBCL [14].
Most of these studies suggest that differences in sensitivity
to pathway inhibition exist between DLBCL subtypes,
with most inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
showing activity in a subset of GCB-DLBCL. However, a
detailed understanding of which subtypes of DLBCL are
resistant to inhibitors of component kinases in this cascade
is lacking. Furthermore, the mechanism by which resistant
cell lines bypass the requirement for AKT has remained
elusive.
Here we show that ABC-DLBCL is resistant to
treatment with AKT inhibitors (AKTi) despite being
sensitive to treatment with mTOR inhibitors. We find
that sensitivity to AKTi is regulated at the level of
S6K1phosphorylation. In cell lines that are sensitive
to AKTi, treatment results in dephopshorylation of
S6K1 and S6, whereas resistant cell lines show AKTindependent activation of S6K1/S6 signaling. Hence,
S6K1 phosphorylation status in AKTi-treated cells is
predictive of response. At least two distinct mechanisms
exist to promote AKT-independent activation of S6K1.
A subset of ABC-DLBCL shows upregulation of PIM2

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the
most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
is generally classified as either activated B cell (ABC)
type or germinal center B cell (GCB) type [1]. ABCDLBCL is characterized by constitutive BCR and NF-κB
signalling, which is required for survival of these tumors
[2]. Frequent mutations in the BCR subunits CD79A/B
[3] or in NF-κB pathway components CARD11 [4], A20
[5], and MyD88 [6] are responsible for activation of these
pathways. GCB tumors often have mutations activating
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling as well as amplification of
the mIR-17-92 locus [7, 8].
Currently, few targeted therapies exist for DLBCL
and the standard of care remains chemotherapy combined
with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (R-CHOP).
Preclinical evidence supporting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway as a therapeutic target in DLBCL has recently
been presented in a number of studies. The combination
of ibrutinib, a specific inhibitor of BTK, with mTOR
inhibitors is effective in ABC-DLBCL [9, 10]. The
mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus has also been combined
with rituximab [11]. In addition, the dual mTOR/PI3K
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 was shown to be effective

which activates S6K1/S6 signaling. Another subset
directly activates S6K1 downstream of BCR signaling
through a mechanism that bypasses AKT. Ultimately, we
use this understanding of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling to
demonstrate that combined inhibition of AKT and S6K1,
PIM2, or BTK can overcome resistance to AKTi alone.

dual TORC1/2 inhibitor [17], and rapamycin, an allosteric
inhibitor of mTORC1, in these cell lines. We calculated
pGI50 values across the cell lines for each inhibitor and
performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering
analysis of the data (Figure 1A). Both mTOR inhibitors
showed similar GI50 values across all DLBCL lines tested,
regardless of subtype. By contrast, AZD5363 showed
a wide range of GI50 values and primarily drove the
clustering. Resistance to AKTi, as defined by a high GI50
value (or low pGI50), correlated with the ABC subtype.
Using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, we compared GI50 values
between the ABC and GCB subtypes (Supplemental Table
1). Resistance to AZD5363 was strongly correlated with
ABC identity (p = 0.002) whereas there was no association
with sensitivity to rapamycin (p = 1.000) or AZD2014 (p
= 0.963).
We confirmed differential sensitivity to AKTi by
selecting for further analysis an AKT-sensitive GCB
line, Karpas422, which possesses an inactivating PTEN
mutation, together with an AKTi-resistant ABC line,
TMD8, that carries an activating CD79B mutation

RESULTS
Differential sensitivity of DLBCL subtypes to
AKT inhibitors
To understand the efficacy of AKT and mTOR
inhibitors across DLBCL subtypes, we assembled a
panel of DLBCL lines. We assigned each line to the
ABC or GCB subtype, or to intermediate status, using
gene expression profiling as previously described [15].
We generated dose-response curves for three inhibitors,
AZD5363, a catalytic inhibitor of AKT [16], AZD2014, a

in response to AKTi in all lines, demonstrating that this
pathway is active. Additionally, we assessed expression
of all AKT isoforms (AKT1/2/3) and PTEN across the
panel. Clustering analysis showed that AKT1 expression
did not discriminate between ABC and GCB lines (SF 2).
Surprisingly, higher expression of AKT2 and AKT3 was
associated with the ABC subtype. This may account for
the fact that resistance to MK2206 is particularly apparent
in TMD8 cells. MK2206, unlike catalytic inhibitors of
AKT, inhibits AKT3 to a lesser extent than AKT1 or
AKT2 [18]. PTEN expression was not correlated with
AKTi sensitivity (p = 0.886; SF2).

resulting in constitutive NF-κB activity. We generated
dose-response curves for both cell lines with three different
AKT inhibitors, AZD5363, GSK690693, and MK2206,
the dual TORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the mTORC1
inhibitor everolimus, using an additional proliferation
assay (CellTiterGlo). All three AKT inhibitors showed
more potent inhibition of cell proliferation in Karpas422
compared to TMD8, with a roughly 5-10 fold lower GI50
(Figure 1B). By contrast, both mTOR inhibitors showed
slightly greater activity in TMD8 (SF 1A). To confirm
that AKT inhibition is not ineffective due to a lack of
AKT signaling in resistant lines, we assessed changes
in phosphorylation of two AKT substrates, PRAS40 and
GSK3β, in response to GSK690693 in four DLBCL lines.
All lines showed a similar dephosphorylation of both
substrates, demonstrating that AKT signaling is intact
in all four cell lines (Figure 1C). We also assessed AKT
activation loop phosphorylation at T308, which is essential
for AKT activity. While, ABC lines showed lower basal
AKT phosphorylation, AKT was hyperphosphorylated

Distinct mechanisms of mTOR regulation
determines sensitivity to AKT inhibitors
Our observation that all DLBCL lines tested were
similarly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors while showing
widely divergent sensitivities to AKTi raised the question

Regulation of mTOR by BCR signaling

of whether AKT is the primary regulator of mTOR
signaling in DLBCL. To gain greater mechanistic insight
into the effects of AKTi on downstream signaling, we
decided to compare AKTi sensitive and resistant lines for
qualitative differences in downstream signaling pathways.
For this comparison, we defined a GI50 value of 1μM
as the cutoff point. We treated Karpas422 (sensitive)
and TMD8 (resistant) with GSK690693 and MK2206
and assessed the phosphorylation of various direct and
indirect targets of AKT signaling. As expected, both cell
lines showed hyperphosphorylation of AKT in response to
the catalytic inhibitor GSK690693 [19] and loss of AKT
phosphorylation in response to the allosteric inhibitor
MK2206 (Figure 2A). Both cell lines also showed
inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation (pGSK3 and
pPRAS40). However, we noted a striking discrepancy in
the response of mTOR substrates to AKTi. In Karpas422,
AKTi inhibited phosphorylation of the direct mTOR
substrates 4EBP1 and S6K1, as well as the indirect
substrate S6. This is consistent with the established view of
AKT as the primary regulator of mTOR signaling in most
contexts. However, AKTi treatment of TMD8 resulted
in little to no dephosphorylation of these substrates. In
fact, GSK690693 treatment actually showed a dramatic
increase in S6K1 phosphorylation in TMD8 cells. These
data suggest that mTOR signaling may not be primarily
regulated by AKT in TMD8.
We expanded our analysis by comparing the effects
of an S6K1-specific inhibitor, PF-4708671 [20] with
GSK690693 across eight DLBCL lines of varying AKTi
sensitivity. We observed that AKTi-sensitive cell lines
showed a small but statistically significant (p < 0.05)
drop in viability with GSK690693 that was not seen
in AKTi-resistant lines (Figure 2B). PF-4708671, by
contrast showed a reduction in viability in all cell lines
that was greater in the majority of AKTi-resistant lines.
We interrogated AKT/mTOR signaling by Western blot
and found that AKT-sensitive lines (HT, Karpas422 and
Ri1) showed inhibition of S6K1 phosphorylation by
GSK690693, while AKTi-resistant lines (OCI-LY10,
RC-K8, TMD8, SUDHL8 and WILL-1) showed no
downregulation of pS6K1 or, in some cases, increased
phosphorylation (Figure 2C).
When we examined S6 phosphorylation, we found a
systematic difference between AKTi-sensitive and resistant
lines (Figure 2C). In sensitive lines, the AKT inhibitor
caused greater dephosphorylation relative to PF-4708671,
whereas in AKT-resistant lines PF-4708671 was more
effective in dephosphorylation relative to GSK690693.
Therefore, while the extent of dephosphorylation seen
with these inhibitors varies significantly by cell line, the
relative potency of S6 dephosphorylation between AKT
and S6K1 inhibitors can distinguish AKTi-sensitive and
resistant lines. These data suggest a difference in S6K1/
S6 regulation between these two clusters of DLBCL lines.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Phosphorylation of S6K1 on T389 in its activation
loop is essential to its activity [21]. mTOR is a wellestablished regulator of S6K1 through phosphorylation
of this site. We confirmed that mTOR activity is essential
for S6K1/S6 signaling in AKTi-sensitive and resistant
lines (SF1B, Figure 3A, and [9]). However, given that
T389 phosphorylation is only regulated by AKT in
sensitive lines, there must be an alternative mechanism
regulating S6K1 in those DLBCL lines that were resistant
to AKTi. Since most AKTi-resistant lines are ABCDLBCL, we hypothesized that mTOR signaling in these
cell lines is regulated through BCR signaling to bypass
the requirement for AKT. We previously published
evidence that ibrutinib, a highly specific inhibitor of the
tyrosine kinase and BCR signaling component BTK,
could downregulate mTOR signaling in ABC-DLBCL
[9]. We compared the ability of ibrutinib, inhibitors
of mTOR, and GSK690693 to block mTOR substrate
phosphorylation in ABC-subtype TMD8 cells (Figure 3A).
Ibrutinib could significantly reduce S6K1 pT389 as well
as S6 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, although to a lesser
extent than mTOR inhibitors. By contrast, GSK690693
treatment increased pT389 and had little or no effect on
pS6 or p4EBP1. Unlike AKTi, the mTOR inhibitors did
not affect pGSK3β, demonstrating no evidence of AKT
inhibition, and ibrutinib showed a variable and lesser
effect on pGSK3β (Figure 3A, 3B). These data confirm
our previous results and, further, suggest that BTK might
regulate mTOR independently of AKT. Since BTK and
AKT inhibitors have opposite effects on pS6K1, BTK may
replace AKT as an upstream regulator of mTOR signaling
in ABC-DLBCL.
Given the effect of ibrutinib on mTOR signaling,
we extended our analysis to determine whether other
kinases involved in BCR signaling could also regulate
mTOR. We compared ibrutinib with specific inhibitors of
SYK (GS-9973)[22], an upstream regulator of BTK, and
PKCβ (LY-333531)[23] which lies downstream of BTK
in the regulation of NF-κB. At the concentrations used,
ibrutinib and GS-9973 are reported to be highly specific
[22, 24]. Less information exists for LY-333531, although
it has been shown to be highly selective for PKCβ over
other PKC isoforms [23]. We used pBLNK as a proximal
marker for BCR signaling and pSTAT3 a marker for
signaling downstream of the BCR. As expected, only
TMD8 and OCILY10 showed strong phosphorylation of
these markers, consistent with the presence of activating
mutations in CD79 and all inhibitors blocked pSTAT3,
while only SYK inhibition downregulated pBLNK (Figure
3B).
In all lines tested, other than RCK8, LY-333531
strongly inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3β and S6, and
inhibited PRAS40 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation in some
cell lines (Figure 3B). This suggests that PKCβ may be
9166

an essential regulator of AKT and mTOR signaling in
DLBCL, although we cannot entirely rule out an offtarget effect on AKT, as both AKT and PKCβ are both
AGC family kinases. However, LY-333531 had similar
effects in ABC and GCB lines and so cannot explain our
observation of AKT-independent activation of mTOR
signaling in ABC lines.
GS-9973 downregulated PRAS40 and 4EBP1
phosphorylation in TMD8 and OCI-LY10, but did not
potently inhibit phosphorylation of other AKT/mTOR
substrates. Ibrutinib strongly reduced phosphorylation of
4EBP1, S6, and S6K1 in OCI-LY10 and TMD8 but not in
any other cell lines. Even the other ABC lines tested (RI1,
SUDHL8, and RCK8) did not show a significant reaction
to BTK or SYK inhibition at the concentrations tested.
TMD8 and OCILY10 have activating mutations in one of
the CD79 subunits of the BCR that are not present in the

other cell lines tested [25] as well as a mutation in MyD88
(L265P) which has been demonstrated to directly activate
BTK [26].Therefore, BTK and SYK may be required for
mTOR signaling in cell lines with active BCR signaling.
Our observation that inhibitors of BCR signaling
could block mTOR in ABC lines raised the question of
how BCR and mTOR signaling are integrated in this
context. The primary output of BCR signaling that has
been linked to DLBCL pathogenesis is NF-κB. A key
regulator of NF-κB, the kinase IKKβ, has previously
been shown to regulate mTOR through phosphorylation
of TSC1 [27]. To explore whether NF-κB could be the
link between BCR and mTOR, we used a luciferase
reporter system to measure NF-κB activity in OCILY10 and TMD8 [9]. In both lines, ibrutinib inhibited
luciferase activity to a similar extent and inhibitors of
SYK and PKCβ were more effective in blocking NF-κB

in OCILY10 than TMD8 (Figure 3C). Since the PKCβ
inhibitor could affect mTOR signaling even in GCB lines,
which do not show activation of NF-κB, we discounted
this mechanism as an explanation for the effects of this
inhibitor. However, the extent of NF-κB inhibition by the
SYK inhibitor GS-9973 correlated with downregulation of
mTOR signaling in these cell lines. This result supported a
mechanism whereby IKKβ links BCR signaling to mTOR.
To test this hypothesis, we treated TMD8 and Karpas422
cells with a specific IKKβ inhibitor [28]. This compound
had no effect on mTOR signaling in Karpas422, consistent
with the lack of NF-κB activation in this GCB line (Figure
3D). In stark contrast to the results in Karpas422, IKKβ
inhibition strongly downregulated phosphorylation of both
AKT and mTOR substrates in TMD8. We also confirmed
that changes in phosphoprotein abundance as a result of
treatment with these inhibitors is not the result of changes
in total protein abundance (SF4). These data support a
model through which ABC lines with activating mutations
in BCR require NF-κB signaling to activate mTOR.

to block proliferation would correlate with its effect on
mTOR signaling. We assessed phosphorylation of mTOR
targets in three DLBCL lines treated with AZD1208
(Figure 4C). We found that AZD1208 did not affect the
AKT substrate GSK3β and showed a slight inhibition of
4EBP1 phosphorylation in both ABC lines. Interestingly,
a differential response to PIM inhibition was observed.
S6K1 and S6 phosphorylation were downregulated in
the sensitive line RCK8 but not in TMD8 or Karpas422.
These data suggest that inhibition of S6K1/S6 is a critical
pharmacodynamics surrogate for growth inhibition by
agents specificially targeting mTOR signaling.

Combined inhibition of multiple kinases efficiently
blocks mTOR signaling
Our data have suggested that multiple kinases can
regulate mTOR signaling to influence proliferation and
survival in DLBCL. Agents inhibiting AKT, PIM, BTK,
or S6K1 are each effective in a subset of DLBCL. We
pursued a strategy of combining these inhibitors to achieve
greater efficacy. Karpas422 cells showed particular
sensitivity to AKTi (SF3A) but only underwent a low
level of cell death in response to single agent treatment.
Combined inhibition of AKT and S6K in this line caused
greater cell death relative to either inhibitor alone (SF3B).
When S6 phosphorylation was assessed, we found that
combined inhibition resulted greater dephosphorylation
than the single agents (SF3C). We made use of the dual
AKT/S6K inhibitor AT7867 [31] to see if this was a
general phenomenon in DLBCL lines. AT7867, unlike
S6K or AKT inhibitors, resulted in complete growth
inhibition of five ABC and GCB lines and induced cell
death at higher concentrations (SF3D). These data support
a model in which AKT and S6K are partially redundant in
DLBCL and combined inhibition can overcome intrinsic
resistance to AKTi in ABC-DLBCL.
Based on our data, PIM or AKT inhibition can
downregulate mTOR in some DLBCL cell lines. Using
our GI50 values for AZD5363 and AZD1208, we chose to
test this combination in Ri1 cells, which are moderately
sensitive to both AKT and PIM inhibitors as single agents.
Simultaneous treatment with both AKT and PIM inhibitors
resulted in nearly complete growth inhibition in Ri1 cells
(Figure 5A), a significant combination benefit over the
single agents. Western blot analysis of Ri1 showed that
either AKT or PIM inhibition alone resulted in moderate
inhibition of pS6K1 and pS6 whereas the combination
treatment completely blocked phosphorylation of these
proteins, but not 4EBP1 (Figure 5B). We also tested this
combination in HBL1 cells, which are highly resistant to
AKTi. Synergy was observed although to a much lesser
degree than in RI1 (SF5).
Finally, we tested whether inhibition of BTK
could overcome the AKTi-resistant phenotype exhibited

PIM2 can promote resistance to AKTi
PIM2 has been reported to be upregulated in
some ABC-DLBCL lines and may be necessary for
their proliferation and survival [29]. PIM kinases share
overlapping substrate specificities with AKT kinases
and may regulate mTOR independently of AKT. We
investigated whether PIM2 upregulation is associated with
resistance to AKTi. We profiled sensitivity to AZD1208,
a selective pan-PIM inhibitor [30], across the DLBCL
panel (Figure 4A). In agreement with previous results, we
found that ABC-DLBCL had generally lower GI50 values
than GCB-DLBCL and that sensitivity to AZD1208 was
correlated with ABC identity (p = 0.014)(Supplemental
table 1). We also measured PIM2 protein expression across
the DLBCL panel and confirmed that ABC-DLBCL show
higher expression on average, although there is significant
variability within both subtypes (Figure 4A). Across the
panel, AZD1208 sensitivity was correlated with mRNA
expression of PIM2 (p = 0.034)(Supplemental table 2).
However, it was clear that some ABC lines express high
levels of PIM2 without being sensitive to the compound
and the correlation between PIM2 protein expression
and sensitivity was very weak (least squares regression
= -0.098). This indicates that factors other than PIM2
expression affect AZD1208 sensitivity.
We selected several DLBCL lines and confirmed
their sensitivity to AZD1208 by measuring net growth
after single agent treatment (Figure 4B). Among ABCDLBCL, RCK8 and RI1 were particularly sensitive to
AZD1208 treatment, in agreement with our profiling
data. TMD8, which expressed higher levels of PIM2
than RCK8 and Ri1, was resistant to AZD1208, again
suggesting that PIM2 expression does not solely determine
sensitivity. We hypothesized that the ability of AZD1208

DISCUSSION

by ABC-DLBCL lines. We tested the combination of
ibrutinib and GSK690693 in TMD8 cells and found
that ibrutinib could not only downregulate S6K1
phosphorylation, but also completely block AKTiinduced hyperphosphorylation of S6K1 (Figure 5C). The
combination was also more effective at dephosphorylating
S6. We tested whether there was a synergistic interaction
between AKTi and ibrutinib in this cell line and found
clear evidence of synergy (Figure 5D; synergy score:
14.7). When we measured the synergy between AKTi and
IKKi in TMD8, we found only very low synergy (Figure
5D and SF5; synergy score: 3.6). We confirmed that the
combination of IKK and AKT inhibition is only weakly
synergistic in OCILY10 (SF5; synergy score: 3.9). These
data (along with the data shown in Figure 3) suggest that
in ABC-DLBCL, NF-κB and mTOR signaling converge at
IKK and that BTK serves to link BCR signaling to mTOR,
perhaps through IKK.

Significant evidence supports the examination
of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling as a therapeutic target
in DLBCL. However, little information exists on the
most effective strategy for targeting this pathway in
DLBCL or on the differential response of DLBCL
subtypes. Here we demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors as
a class are broadly effective in arresting proliferation of
DLBCL lines, regardless of ABC or GCB classification.
However, DLBCL lines differ greatly in their sensitivity
to AKT inhibitors, both ATP-competitive and allosteric.
Furthermore, we show a correlation between the ABC
subtype and resistance to inhibition of AKT. The finding
that there is a clear uncoupling between sensitivity to
mTOR and AKT inhibitors is surprising given that AKT
has been well established has a regulator of mTORC1
in response to extracellular stimuli [32]. Therefore,
we explored the regulation of mTOR in DLBCL. We
found that GCB lines, some of which show activation

of AKT through mutation or deletion of PTEN, preserve
canonical signalling between AKT and mTOR and that
AKT inhibitors can downregulate mTORC1 substrate
phosphorylation in these cells. ABC lines, however,
show a regulation of mTOR that is quite distinct
from this described mechanism. In these lines, AKT
inhibitors have a lesser effect on the phosphorylation
of translational inhibitors S6 and 4EBP1. Even more
strikingly, phosphorylation of S6K1, an mTOR
substrate and the immediate upstream regulator of S6,
is downregulated by AKT inhibitors in GCB-DLBCL
but is either entirely unaffected or upregulated in ABCDLBCL. A clear correlation among DLBCL lines is seen
between dephosphorylation of S6 by AKT inhibitors and
sensitivity. And surprisingly, ABC-DLBCL lines that show
a lesser dependence on AKT for S6 phosphorylation show
a greater dependence on S6K1.
These data suggested alternative modes of mTOR,
and particularly S6K1, activation in ABC-DLBCL.
We find that in some ABC-DLBCL lines, the tyrosine
kinase BTK is required for mTOR activation and may act
through NF-κB signaling. In other lines, PIM2 is required
for S6K1/S6 signalling, in agreement with data showing
that PIM kinases share substrates with AKT kinases [33].
These mechanisms can promote AKT-independent but
mTOR-dependent activation of translational machinery
[34]. We have also established that there is a strong
correlation between ABC identity and AKTi resistance in
ABC-DLBCL. Given these data, it is plausible that the
primary explanation for AKTi resistance in ABC lines
is the prevalence of BCR pathway mutations (including
CD79 and MyD88 mutations) that render mTOR
activation independent of AKT. In ABC lines without
these mutations, PIM2 upregulation may serve the same
purpose. Our data also suggests that multiple pathways can
redundantly regulate mTOR activation in DLBCL lines.
For example, AKT and PIM2 can both regulate mTOR
in RI1 and combined inhibition is required to completely
downregulate S6K signaling in this line.
In summary, our data point toward the existence
of multiple mechanisms for the regulation of mTOR
in DLBCL (SF6). The sensitivity of DLBCL lines to
AKT inhibitors appears to be determined by the genetic
background of the cell line, which may help to determine
which of these mechanisms is dominant (Supplemental
Table 4). Therefore, understanding the classification of
DLBCL may be very important for effective targeting
of mTOR signalling and therapeutic use of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors could be influence by
mutational analysis of patient tumors. Given the increasing
importance of PI3K inhibition in targeted therapies for
lymphoma, this may be of clinical interest [35]. We also
show that combination therapy to inhibit more than one
kinase involved in mTOR signaling can more effective
than targeting a single kinase.

Western blots and drug treatments
Western blots were performed as previously
described [9]. Antibodies for AKT, GSK3, S6, 4EBP1,
S6K1, GAPDH, vinculin, and STAT3 were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology. PRAS40 antibody
was purchased from Invitrogen. BLNK antibody was
purchased from BD Biosciences. GSK690693, MK2206,
everolimus, rapamycin, PF-4708671, AT7867, GS-9973,
and ibrutinib were purchased from Selleck. LY-333531
was purchased from Tocris. AZD2014, AZD5363,
AZD1208, and C21H25ClN4O2 were synthesized by
AstraZeneca.

Proliferation and viability assays
Alamar blue assays were performed as previously
described [9]. Net growth proceeded as follows: cells
were seeded at predetermined densities, dosed the next
day (D0), and read on Day 3. Net growth was calculated
using the following formula: (Experimental reading - D0
reading)/(DMSO reading - D0 reading). CellTiterGlo
experiments were performed as Alamar blue assays,
except CellTiterGlo reagents was added 1:1 to medium
containing cells and plates were incubated for 10 minutes
at room temperature before luminescence was read on
a Tecan system. Cell viability was measured by trypan
blue staining (1:2 dilution of cells in 0.1% trypan blue)
followed by automated cell counting using the Cellometer
system. 6x6 matrix-based synergy assays were performed
as previously described [9].

Luciferase assays
Cells were plated at 500,00/ml and treated for 18
hours with indicated compounds. Cells were then collected
by centrifugation and normalized by Cellometer reading.
Cells were plated at 100,000/ml in 96-well white bottom
plates (100μl). Dual-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega)
was added at a 1:1 ratio and plates were incubated at room
temperature for 10 minutes before reading on a Tecan
system.

Bioinformatics
Cell of origin (COO) values were derived as
previously described [15]. Statistical tests were performed
in R version 3.1.1. The expressions of AKT isoforms were
measured using microarray data. Representative probesets
were selected to represent each isoform (207163_s_at
for AKT1, 225471_s_at for AKT2 and 212607_at for
9171

Oncotarget

AKT3). Measured signals were log2 transformed before
the analysis. The transformed values were then clustered
using complete linkage method with Euclidean distance
measure. The heatmap was prepared using R (heatmap.2
method in package gplots). The Affymetrix U133 plus 2
cell line expression data can be found at GEO accession
GSE57083.
GI50 values were transformed into pGI50 using
-log10(GI50), where value of 6.0 corresponds to 1.0
µM. Higher values indicate higher sensitivities. The
transformed values were then clustered using complete
linkage method with Euclidean distance measure. The
heatmap was prepared using R (heatmap.2 method in
package gplots).
