Abstract

Author Manuscript

Human cells have twenty-three pairs of chromosomes but in cancer, genes can be amplified in
chromosomes or in circular extrachromosomal DNA (ECDNA), whose frequency and functional
significance are not understood1–4. We performed whole genome sequencing, structural modeling
and cytogenetic analyses of 17 different cancer types, including 2572 metaphases, and developed
ECdetect to conduct unbiased integrated ECDNA detection and analysis. ECDNA was found in
nearly half of human cancers varying by tumor type, but almost never in normal cells. Driver
oncogenes were amplified most commonly on ECDNA, elevating transcript level. Mathematical
modeling predicted that ECDNA amplification elevates oncogene copy number and increases
intratumoral heterogeneity more effectively than chromosomal amplification, which we validated
by quantitative analyses of cancer samples. These results suggest that ECDNA contributes to
accelerated evolution in cancer.

Cancers evolve in rapidly changing environments from single cells into genetically
heterogeneous masses. Darwinian evolution selects for those cells better fit to their
environment. Heterogeneity provides a pool of mutations upon which selection can act1, 5–9.
Cells that acquire fitness-enhancing mutations are more likely to pass these mutations on to
daughter cells, driving neoplastic progression and therapeutic resistance10, 11. One common
type of cancer mutation, oncogene amplification, can be found either in chromosomes or
nuclear ECDNA elements, including double minutes (DMs)2–4, 12–14. Relative to
chromosomal amplicons, ECDNA is less stable, segregating unequally to daughter
cells15, 16. DMs are reported to occur in 1.4% of cancers with a maximum of 31.7% in
neuroblastoma, based on the Mitelman database4, 17. However, the scope of ECDNA in
cancer has not been accurately quantified, the oncogenes contained therein have not been
systematically examined, and the impact of ECDNA on tumor evolution has yet to be
determined.

DNA sequencing permits unbiased analysis of cancer genomes, but it cannot spatially
resolve amplicons to specific chromosomal or EC regions. Bioinformatic analyses can
potentially infer DNA circularity18, but EC amplicons may vary from cell to cell.
Consequently, ECDNA oncogene amplification may be greatly underestimated. Cytogenetic
analysis of tumor cell metaphases can localize amplicons, but this technique does not permit
unbiased discovery. To quantify the spectrum of ECDNA in human cancer and
systematically interrogate its contents, we integrated whole genome sequencing (WGS) of
117 cancer cell lines, patient-derived tumor cell cultures and tumor tissues from a range of
cancer types (Fig. 1A), with bioinformatic and cytogenetic analysis of 2049 metaphases
from 72 cancer cell samples for which metaphases could be obtained. Additionally, 290
metaphases from 10 immortalized cell cultures, and 233 metaphases from 8 normal tissue
cultures were analyzed, for a total of 2572 metaphases (Source Data Table S1 and Methods).
The fluorescent dye DAPI, 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, permits ECDNA detection (Fig.
1B), as confirmed using genomic DNA and centromeric FISH probes (Fig. 1B–D; Extended
Data Fig. E1). We developed an image analysis software package ECdetect (Fig. 1E;

Methods), providing a robust, reproducible and highly accurate method for quantifying
ECDNA from DAPI-stained metaphases in an unbiased, semi-automated fashion. ECdetect
accurately detected ECDNA and was highly correlated with visual detection (r=0.98, p < 2.2
× 10−16, Fig. 1F), permitting quantification in 2572 metaphases, including at least 20
metaphases from each sample.

ECDNA was abundant in the cancer samples (Fig. 2A), but was rarely found in normal cells.
Approximately 30% of the ECDNAs were paired DMs (Source Data Table S2). ECDNA
levels varied among tumor types, with substantially higher levels in patient-derived cultures
(Fig. 2B). Using the conservative metric of at least 2 ECDNAs in ≥ 10% (2 of 20)
metaphases, ECDNA was detected in nearly 40% of tumor cell lines and nearly 90% of
patient-derived brain tumor models (Fig. 2C–D; Methods; Extended Data Fig. E2). No
significant associations between ECDNA level and either: a) primary vs. metastatic status;
b) untreated vs. treated samples or c) un-irradiated vs. post-irradiated tumors were detected
(Source Data Table S2). The diverse array of treatments relative to sample size limited our
ability to definitively determine the impact of specific therapies on ECDNA levels. ECDNA
number varied greatly from cell to cell within a tumor culture (Fig. 2E–G; Extended Data
Fig. E3; Supplementary Section 2.3), as quantified by the Shannon Index19. These data
demonstrate that ECDNA is common in cancer, varies greatly from cell to cell, and is very
rare in normal tissue.

WGS with median coverage of 1.19× (Extended Data Fig. E4) revealed focal amplifications
that were nearly identical to the amplifications found in the TCGA analyses of the same
cancer types (Fig. 3A; Source Data Table S3), including amplified oncogenes found in a
pan-cancer analysis of 13 different cancer types20. All of the amplified oncogenes tested
were found solely on ECDNA, or concurrently on ECDNA and chromosomal homogenous
staining regions (HSRs) (Fig. 3B–C; Extended Data Fig. E5–6). Oncogenes amplified in
ECDNA expressed high levels of mRNA transcripts (Fig. 3D) and the copy number diversity
of commonly amplified oncogenes in ECDNA far exceeded their copy number diversity if
they were on other chromosomal loci (Extended Data Fig. E7).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether extra- and intrachromosomal structures had a common origin, we
developed ‘AmpliconArchitect’ to elucidate the finer genomic structure using sequencing
data (Methods). To better understand the relationship between subnuclear location and
amplicon structure, we took advantage of spontaneously occurring subclone of GBM39 cells
in which high copy EGFRvIII shifted from ECDNA exclusively to HSRs. Independent
replicates of GBM39 containing an ECDNA amplicon, revealed a consistent circular
structure of 1.29 MB containing one copy of EGFRvIII (Extended Data Fig. E8).
Remarkably, the GBM39 subclone harboring EGFRvIII exclusively on HSRs had an
identical structure with tandem duplications containing multiple copies of EGFRvIII,
indicating that the HSRs arose from reintegration of EGFRvIII-containing ECDNA elements
(Extended Data Fig. E8)14. In GBM39 cells, resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors is caused by reversible loss of EGFRvIII on ECDNA21. Structural analysis
revealed a conservation of the fine structure of the EGFRvIII amplicon containing ECDNA
in naïve cells, in treatment, and upon regrowth with discontinuation of therapy (Extended

Does ECDNA localization confer any particular benefit? We hypothesized ECDNA
amplification may enable an oncogene to rapidly reach higher copy number because of the
unequal segregation to daughter cells15 than would be possible by intrachromosomal
amplification. We used a simplified Galton-Watson branching process to model the evolution
of a tumor23, where each cell in the current generation either replicates or dies to create the
next generation. A cell with k copies of the amplicon is selected for replication with
probability bk; bk/(1-bk) = 1 + sfm(k). We provided a positive selection bias towards cells
with higher ECDNA counts by choosing s ϵ {0.5,1} along with different selection functions
for f. Specifically, fm(k) increases to a maximum value fm(15) = 1, then declines in a logistic
manner with fm(m) = 0.5 to reflect metabolic constraints (Methods). We allowed the
amplicon copy number to grow to 1000 copies (Extended Data Fig. E10), but set bk = 0 for k
≥ 103. During cell division, the 2k copies resulting from the replication of each of the k
ECDNA copies segregate independently into the two daughter cells. We contrasted this with
an intrachromosomal model of duplication with identical selection constraints, but with the
change in copy number affected by mitotic recombination, and achieved by incrementing or
decrementing k by 1, with duplication probability pd. A range of values for pd, (0.01 ≤ pd ≤
0.1) was used, where the upper bound reflects a change in copy number once every 5
divisions. The full assumptions of the model are explained in detail in Supplementary
Material Section 4. Starting with an initial population of 105 cells, with s = 0.5 and m = 100
and a selection function f100(k) (Fig. 4A), we find that an oncogene can reach much higher
copy number in a tumor if it is amplified on ECDNA, rather than on a chromosome (Fig.
4B). As predicted by the model, we detected significantly higher copy number of the most
frequently amplified oncogenes EGFR (including EGFRvIII) and c-MYC, when they were
contained within ECDNA instead of within chromosomes (Fig. 4C). We also reasoned that if
an oncogene is amplified intra-chromosomally, the heterogeneity of the tumor (in terms of
the distribution of copies of the oncogene) would stabilize at a much lower level. In contrast,
unequal segregation of ECDNA would be likely to rapidly enhance heterogeneity and
maintain it. Our model confirmed this prediction (Fig. 4D), consistently for a wide range of
simulation parameters (Supplementary Material Section 4.3). The heterogeneity of copy
number change stabilizes and even decreases over time10, 24, much as predicted in Fig. 4C–
D. We also tested the validity of the model by comparing the Shannon entropy against the
average number of amplicons per cell in our tumor samples. Heterogeneity of a tumor with
respect to oncogene copy number would be more likely to rise relatively slowly if it is
present on a chromosome, but would rise more rapidly and be maintained much longer, if
that oncogene is present on ECDNA, as confirmed by a plot of Shannon entropy vs copy
number (Fig. 4E). Moreover, the predicted correlation in Fig. 4E is completely recapitulated
by the experimental data (Fig. 4F), thereby validating the central tenets of the model.
There is growing evidence that genetically heterogeneous tumors are remarkably difficult to
treat10. The data presented here identifies a mechanism by which tumors maintain cell-tocell variability in the copy number and transcriptional level of oncogenes that drive tumor
progression and drug resistance. We suggest that EC oncogene amplification may enable
tumors to adapt more effectively to variable environmental conditions by increasing the

likelihood that a subpopulation of cells will express that oncogene at a level that maximizes
its proliferation and survival12, 21, 25–28, rendering tumors progressively more aggressive and
difficult to treat over time. Even when using a selection function that only mildly depends on
copy number, we detected a very large difference between intra-and extrachromosomal
amplification mechanisms leading to higher copy number of amplicons and greater
heterogeneity of copy number. Thus, even small increases in selection advantage conferred
by oncogenes amplified on ECDNA would be expected to yield a very high fitness
advantage (Supplementary Material Section 4.3). The strikingly high frequency of ECDNA
in cancer, as shown here, coupled to the benefits to tumors of EC gene amplification relative
to chromosomal inheritance, suggest that oncogene amplification on ECDNA may be a
driving force in tumor evolution and the development of genetic heterogeneity in human
cancer. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor evolution, including
oncogene amplification in ECDNA, may help to identify more effective treatments that
either prevent cancer progression or more effectively eradicate it.

Author Manuscript

Metaphase cells were obtained by treating cells with Karyomax (Gibco) at a final
concentration of 0.01 µg/ml for 1–3 hours. Cells were collected, washed in PBS, and
resuspended in 0.075 M KCl for 15–30 minutes. Carnoy’s fixative (3:1 methanol/glacial
acetic acid) was added dropwise to stop the reaction. Cells were washed an additional 3
times with Carnoy’s fixative, before being dropped onto humidified glass sides for
metaphase cell preparations. For ECdetect analyses, DAPI was added to the slides. Images
in the main figures were captured with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. All other
images were captured at a magnification of 1000 with an Olympus BX43 microscope
equipped with a QiClick cooled camera. FISH was performed by adding the appropriate
DNA FISH probe onto the fixed metaphase spreads. A coverslip was added and sealed with
rubber cement. DNA denaturation was carried out at 75 °C for 3–5 minutes and the slides
were allowed to hybridize overnight at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Slides were
subsequently washed in 0.4× SSC at 50 °C for 2 minutes, followed by a final wash in 2×
SSC/0.05% Tween-20. Metaphase cells and interphase nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI, a coverslip was applied, and images were captured.
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

The NCI-60 cell line panel (gift from Andrew Shiau-obtained from NCI) was grown in
RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS under standard culture conditions. Cell lines were not
authenticated, as they were obtained from the NCI. The PDX cell lines were cultured in
DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with Glutamax, B27, EGF, FGF, and Heparin.
Lymphoblastoid cells (gifts from Bing Ren) were grown in RPMI-1640, supplemented with
2 mM glutamine and 15% FBS. IMR90 and ALS6-Kin4 (gift from John Ravits and Don
Cleveland) cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 20% FBS. Normal human
astrocytes (NHA) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were obtained from Lonza
and cultured according to Lonza-specific recommendation. Cell lines were not tested for
mycoplasma contamination.

Tissue samples

Author Manuscript

Tissues were obtained from the Moores Cancer Center Biorepository Tissue Shared
Resource with IRB approval (#090401). All samples were de-identified and patient consent
was obtained. Additional tissue samples that were obtained were approved by the UCSD
IRB (#120920).
DNA library preparation
DNA was sonicated to produce 300–500bp fragments. DNA end repair was performed using
End-it (Epicentre), DNA library adapters (Illumina) were ligated, and the DNA libraries
were amplified. Paired-end next generation sequencing was performed and samples were run
on the Illumina Hi-Seq using 100 cycles.
DNA extraction

Author Manuscript

Cells were collected and washed with 1× cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer
1 (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 50 µg/ml RNase A), and incubated in Buffer 2 (1.2%
SDS) for 5 minutes on ice. DNA was acidified by the addition of Buffer 3 (3 M CsCl, 1 M
potassium acetate, 0.67 M acetic acid) and incubated for 15 minutes on ice. Samples were
centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to a Qiagen
column and briefly centrifuged. The column was washed (60% ethanol, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5,
50 µM EDTA, 80 mM potassium acetate) and eluted in water.
DNase treatment

Author Manuscript

Metaphase cells were dropped onto slides and visualized via DAPI. Coverslips were
removed and slides washed in 2× SSC, and subsequently treated with 2.5% trypsin, and
incubated at 25 °C for 3 minutes. Slides were then washed in 2× SSC, DNase solution (1
mg/ml) was applied to the slide, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 hours. Slides were
washed in 2× SSC and DAPI was again applied to the slide to visualize DNA.
ECDNA count statistics
In Figures 2A and 2B, the violin plots represent the distribution of ECDNA counts in
different sample types. In order to compare the ECDNA counts between the different
samples, we use a one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, where the null hypothesis assumes the
mean ECDNA count ranks of the compared sample types equal.
Estimation of frequency of samples containing ECDNA

Author Manuscript

There is a wide variation in the number of ECDNA across different samples and within
metaphases of the same sample. We want to estimate and compare the frequency of samples
containing ECDNA for each sample type. We label a sample as being ECDNA-positive by
using the pathology standard: a sample is deemed to be ECDNA-positive if we observe ≥ 2
ECDNA in ≥ 2 images out of 20 metaphase images. Therefore, we ensure that every sample
contains at least 20 metaphases.
We define indicator variable Xij = 1 if metaphase image j in sample i has ≥ 2 ECDNA; Xij =
0 otherwise. Let ni be the number of metaphase images acquired from sample i. We assume

that Xij is the outcome of the jth Bernoulli trial, where the probability of success pi is drawn
at random from a beta distribution with parameters determined by ∑jXij. Formally,

We model the likelihood of observing k successes in n = 20 trials using the binomial density
function as:

Finally, the predictive distribution p(k), is computed using the product of the Binomial
likelihood and Beta prior, modeled as a “beta-binomial distribution”29.

We model the probability for sample i being ECDNA-positive with the random variable Yi
such that:

The expected value of Yi is:

sufficiently small ε. For more detail, please see Supplementary Material Section 1.
Comparison of ECDNA presence between different sample types

Author Manuscript

We construct binary ECDNA presence distributions, based on the ECDNA counts, such that
an image with ≥ 2 ECDNA is represented as a 1, and 0 otherwise. In order to compare the
ECDNA presence between the different samples, we use a one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test
using the binary ECDNA presence distributions, where the null hypothesis assumes the
mean ranks of the compared sample types equal.
ECdetect: Software for detection of extrachromosomal DNA from DAPI staining metaphase
images

Author Manuscript

The software applies an initial coarse adaptive thresholding30, 31 on the DAPI images to
detect the major components in the image with a window size of 150×150 pixels, and T =
10% Components breaching 3000 pixels and 80% of solidity are masked, and small
components discarded. Weakly connected components (CC) of the remaining binary image
are computed to find the separate chromosomal regions. CC breaching a cumulative pixel
count of 5000 are considered as candidate search regions, and their convex hull with a
dilation of 100 pixels are added into the ECDNA search region. Following the manual
masking and verification of the ECDNA search region, a second finer adaptive thresholding
with a window size of 20×20 pixels and T = 7% is performed. Components that are greater
than 75 pixels are designated as non-ECDNA structures and their 15 pixel neighborhood is
removed from the ECDNA search region. Any component detected with a size less than or
equal to 75 and greater than or equal to 3 pixels inside the search region is detected as
ECDNA. For more detail, please see Supplementary Material Section 2.
Bioinformatic datasets

Author Manuscript

We sequenced 117 tumor samples including 63 cell lines, 19 neurospheres and 35 cancer
tissues with coverage ranging from 0.6× to 3.89× and an additional 8 normal tissues as
controls. See Extended Data Figure E4 for the coverage distribution across samples. We
mapped the sequencing reads from each sample to hg19 (GRCh37) human reference
genome32 from UCSC genome browser33 using BWA software version 0.7.9a34. We inferred
an initial set of copy number variants from these mapped sequence samples using the
ReadDepth CNV software35 version 0.9.8.4 with parameters FDR = 0.05 and
overDispersion = 1.
We downloaded copy number variation calls (CNV) for 11079 tumor-normal samples
covering 33 different tumor types from TCGA. We applied similar filtering criteria to
ReadDepth output and TCGA calls to eliminate false CN amplification calls from repetitive
genomic regions and hotspots for mapping artefacts.

We used the filtered set of CNV calls from ReadDepth as input probes for
AmpliconArchitect which revealed the final set of amplified intervals and the architectures
of the amplicons. See Supplementary Material Section 3 for more details.
Reconstruction using AmpliconArchitect

Author Manuscript

We developed a novel tool AmpliconArchitect (AA), to automatically identify connected
amplified genomic regions and reconstruct plausible amplicon architectures. For each
sample, AA takes as input an initial list of amplified intervals and whole genome sequencing
(WGS) paired-end reads aligned to the human reference. It implements the following steps
to reconstruct the one or more architectures for each amplicon present in the sample: (a) Use
discordant read-pair alignments and coverage information to iteratively visit and extend
connected genomic regions with high copy numbers. (b) For each set of connected amplified
regions, segment the regions based on depth of coverage using a mean-shift segmentation to
detect copy number changes and discordant read-pair clusters to identify genomic breaks. (c)
Construct a breakpoint graph connecting segments using discordant read-pair clusters. (d)
Compute a maximum likelihood network to estimate copy counts of genomic segments. (e)
Report paths and cycles in the graph that identify the dominant linear and circular structures
representing one. (Supplementary Material Section 3)
Comparison of CNV gains between the sequencing sample set and TCGA

Author Manuscript

We compared our sample set against TCGA samples to test the assumption that the genomic
intervals amplified in our sample set are broadly representative of a pan-cancer dataset, by
comparing against TCGA samples. Here, we deal with an abstract notation to represent
different datasets and describe a generic procedure to compare amplified regions. Consider a
set of K samples. For any k ∈ [1, …, K], let Sk denote the set of amplified intervals in
sample k.
Let c be the cancer subtype for sample k. We compare Sk against TCGA samples with subtype c. Let T denote the set of all genomic regions which are amplified in at least 1% of
TCGA samples of subtype c. For each interval t ∈ T, let ft denote its frequency in TCGA
samples of subtype c. We define a match score

The cumulative match score for all samples is defined as:

Author Manuscript

To compute the significance of statistic D, we do a permutation test. We generate N random
permutations of the TCGA intervals for subtype c and estimate distribution of match scores
of our sample set against the random permutations. We choose a random assignment of
locations of all intervals in T, while retaining their frequencies. For the jth permuted set Tj,
we computed the cumulative match score Dj relative to our sample set. Thus the significance

of overlap between our sample set and the TCGA amplified intervals is estimated by the
fraction of random permutations with Dj > D. Computing 1 million random permutations
generated exactly one permutation breaching the TCGA score D, implying a p-value ≤ 10−6.
Oncogene Enrichment
We compared the rank correlation of the most frequent oncogenes in our sample set with the
top oncogenes as reported by TCGA pan-cancer analysis by Zack et al20. We identified 14
oncogenes occurring in 2 or more samples of our sample set and compared these with the
top 10 oncogenes from the TCGA pan-cancer analysis. We found that 7 out of the top 10
oncogenes were represented in our list of 14 oncogenes. Considering 490 oncogenes in the
COSMIC database, the significance of observing 7 or more oncogenes in common in the
two datasets is given by the hypergeometric probability

Amplicon structure similarity

Author Manuscript

We found high similarity between amplicon structures of biological replicates (e.g. Extended
Data Figure E8). We estimate probability of common origin between two samples by
measuring the pairwise similarity between amplicon structures. In reconstructing the
structures (Supplementary Material Section 3), we identify a set of locations representing
change in copy number and we use the locations of change in copy number to estimate the
similarity in amplicon structures.
Let L be the total length of amplified intervals. These intervals are binned into windows of
size r, resulting in Nb = L/r bins. We use a segmentation algorithm that determines if there is
a change in copy number in any bin, within a resolution of r = 10,000 bp. (See Meanshift in
coverage: Supplementary Materials Section 3.2.) Note that this is an over-estimate, since
with split-reads and high density sequencing data, we can often get the resolution down to a
few base pairs. Let S1 and S2 represent the set of bins with copy number changes in the two
samples, respectively. S1 and S2 are selected from a candidate set of locations Nb. Under the
null hypothesis that S2 is random with respect to S1, we expect I = S1 ∩ S2 to be small. Let
m = min{|S1|, |S2|}, and M = max{|S1|, |S2|}. A p-value is computed as follows:

In looking at GBM39 replicates (Extended Data Figure E8), we find that all replicates
displaying EGFR ECDNA are similar to each other. Comparing replicates in row 1 and row
2 among |Nb| = 129 bins (1.29 Mbp), |S1| = 5 corresponding to row 1 (EC sample), |S2| = 6

corresponding to row 2 (EC sample) and intersection set size |I| = 5, we compute the p-value
for observing such structural similarity by random chance is 2.18 × 10−8 which is the highest
p-value among all EC replicate pairs. In addition, we compare the replicates displaying
EGFR on ECDNA with the culture displaying EGFR on HSR. Among |Nb| = 129 bins, |S1| =
6 corresponding to row 2 (EC), |S2| = 4 corresponding to row 4 (HSR), the intersection set
has size |I| = 4 intervals giving a p-value of 1.98 × 10−5 which gives the highest p-value
among the 3 ECDNA replicates compared to the HSR culture, suggesting a common origin.
A branching process model for oncogene amplification

Author Manuscript

Consider an initial population of N0 cells, of which Nα cells contain a single extra copy of
an oncogene. We model the population using a discrete generation Galton-Watson branching
process23. In this simplified model, each cell in the current generation containing k
amplicons (amplifying an oncogene) either replicates with probability bk to create the next
generation, or dies with probability 1 - bk to create the next generation. We set the selective
advantage

(1)

In other words, cells with k copies of the amplicon stop dividing after reaching a limit of Mα
amplicons. Otherwise, they have a selective advantage for 0 < k ≤ Mα, where the strength of
selection is described by fm(k), as follows:

(2)

Here, s denotes the selection-coefficient, and parameters m and α are the ‘mid-point’, and
‘steepness’ parameters of the logistic function, respectively. Initially, fm(k) grows linearly,
reaching a peak value of fm(k) = 1 for k = Ms. As the viability of cells with large number of
amplicons is limited by available nutrition36, fm(k) decreases logistically in value for k > Ms
reaching fm(k) → 0 for k ≥ Mα. We model the decrease by a sigmoid function with a single
mid-point parameter m s.t. fm(m) = 1/2. The ‘steepness’ parameter α is automatically
adjusted to ensure that min{1 – fm(Ms), fm(Mα)} → 0.

The copy number change is affected by different mechanisms for extrachromosomal (EC)
and intrachromosomal (HSR) models. In the EC model, the available k amplicons are on EC
elements which replicate and segregate independently. We assume complete replication of
EC elements so that there are 2k copies which are partitioned into the two daughter cells via
independent segregation. Formally, the daughter cells end up with k1 and k2 amplicons
respectively, where

In contrast, in the intrachromosomal model, the change in copy number happens via mitotic
recombination, and the daughter cell of a cell with k amplicons will acquire either k + 1
amplicons or k − 1 amplicons, each with probability pd. With probability 1 – 2pd, the
daughter cell retains k amplicons. See Supplementary Material Section 4 for more details.

Copy number amplification and diversity due to ECDNA. To test how much of the copy
number and diversity could be attributed to ECDNA, we chose FISH probes that bind to four
of the most commonly amplified oncogenes in our sample set, EGFR, MYC, CCND1 or
ERBB2, and quantified the cell-to-cell variability in their DNA copy number in metaphase
spreads, from four tumor cell lines: GBM39, MB411FH, SF295 and PC3 cancer cells. For
each cell line, only the target oncogene marked in red is known to be amplified on ECDNA
(EGFR in GBM39; MYC in MB411FH and PC3, and CCND1 in SF295). The other 3 genes
reside on chromosomal loci. The target oncogene shows consistently higher copy numbers
(Top Panel) and diversity (Bottom Panel).

Fine structure analysis of EGFRvIII Amplification in Extrachromosomal or Chromosomal
DNA in GBM39 Cells: a., FISH images revealed EGFR gene on ECDNAs (top) and HSRs
(bottom) on different passes of the GBM39 cell line. Analysis of the HSR FISH images
shows evidence of multiple integration sites on different chromosomes. b., Next generation
sequencing of DNA from 4 independent cultures of GBM39 was used to analyze the fine
structure of amplifications (Supplementary Material Section 4.3). In 3 biological replicates
(rows 1 to 3) of these cultures, EGFRvIII was exclusively on ECDNA, while one of the later
passage cultures (row 4) was found to contain EGFRvIII entirely on HSRs, with no
detectable ECDNA. The DNA derived from different ECDNA cultures shows identical
structure with some heterogeneity (p < 2.18 × 10−8 for all pairs), suggesting common origin.
However, DNA derived from HSRs reveals a conserved structure that is identical to ECDNA
structure (p < 1.98 × 10−5, Supplementary Material Section 2.4), possibly with tandem
duplications. c., A possible progression of normal genome to cancer genome with EGFRvIII
ECDNAs and amplification to a copy count of around 100 copies. The EGFRvIII ECDNAs
possibly aggregate into tandem duplications and reintegrate into multiple chromosomes as
HSRs such that 5–6 HSRs accommodate around 100 copies of EGFRvIII.

Fine structure analysis of EGFRvIII Amplification in Extrachromosomal or Chromosomal
DNA in naive GBM39 cells and in response to Erlotinib Treatment (ERZ) and Drug
Withdrawal: a., FISH images of naive GBM39 cells, in response to Erlotinib Treatment
(ERZ) and Drug Withdrawal displayed EC amplification, HSR amplification and EC
amplification respectively (top to bottom). b., Next generation sequencing of DNA from 6
independent cultures of GBM39 was used to analyze the fine structure of amplifications
(Supplementary Material Section 4.3). Average copy numbers of amplified intervals as
determined from sequencing analysis in naive samples (biological replicates in rows 1 to 3):
110 to 150, ERZ sample (row 4): 5.4 and Erlotinib removed (biological replicates in rows 5
and 6): 100–105. All three categories show similar fine structure indicating common origin
(Methods). Erlotinib removed replicates show additional rearrangements and heterogeneity
as compared to naive samples. c., Cytogenetic and sequencing progression suggests the
EGFRvIII ECDNAs in naive cells get reintegrated into HSRs after drug application and the
copies in the HSRs break off from the chromosomes again to form ECDNAs with copy
count similar to naive cells. Drug removed samples also show additional heterogeneity in
structure.
