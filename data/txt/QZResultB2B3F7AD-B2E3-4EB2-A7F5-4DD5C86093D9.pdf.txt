ABSTRACT:
Autophagy, a process of regulated turnover of cellular constituents, is essential
for normal growth control but may be defective under pathological conditions. The
Ras/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway negatively regulates autophagy. Ras signaling
has been documented in a large number of human cancers. In this in-vitro study we
examined the effect of the Ras inhibitor Salirasib (S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic
acid; FTS) on autophagy induction and cell viability. We show that Ras inhibition by
FTS induced autophagy in several cell lines, including mouse embryonic fibroblasts
and the human cancer cell lines HeLa, HCT-116 and DLD-1. The autophagy induced by
FTS seems to inhibit the cell death induced by FTS, since in the absence of autophagy
the death of FTS-treated cells was enhanced. Therefore, inhibition of autophagy may
promote the inhibition of tumor cell growth and the cell death mediated by FTS.

INTRODUCTION

including the growth, differentiation, motility and death
of cells [10]. Signals transmitted by activated Ras are
mediated through the protein’s interaction with multiple
effectors including mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK),
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and Ral-GEF [10, 11].
Ras signaling is activated in a large number of human
cancers [12]. Mutations of codons 12, 13 and 61 in Ras
result in constitutively active Ras, and activating mutations
of the three major Ras isoforms (H, K and N) have been
found in more than 30% of human cancers [13-15].
Because Ras signaling represents a convergence
juncture for many different extracellular signals,
Ras and its effectors may be appropriate targets for
therapeutic intervention. Ras is post-translationally
modified by the addition of a farnesyl lipid group
that allows its attachment to the cell membrane [16].
Attempts have therefore been made to block Ras or
Ras-dependent functions in cancer cell lines by the use
of farnesyltransferase inhibitors [17-19]. S-trans, transfarnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; also known as Salirasib)
is a synthetic Ras inhibitor that structurally resembles the
carboxy-terminal farnesylcysteine group common to all
Ras proteins. FTS acts as a functional Ras antagonist in
cells, affecting Ras/membrane interactions, dislodging
the protein from its anchorage domains and facilitating
its degradation, thereby reducing cellular Ras content

Autophagy is a process of self-digestion of cellular
constituents through an autophagosomic-lysosomal
pathway [1, 2]. It is important for normal growth control
but may be defective under pathological conditions [3,
4]. Autophagy plays an essential role in maintaining the
balance between the formation and the degradation of
proteins and as a cell-survival mechanism under stressful
conditions such as absence of nutrients. Thus, autophagy
is important for normal cell growth, differentiation and
survival [5]. Autophagy has been linked to some forms
of cancer, including pancreatic and breast carcinomas
and hepatoma [4]. Studies on regulation of autophagy
by the autophagy-regulating genes Atg (Apg/Aut) have
contributed to our understanding of the molecular control
of autophagy [1, 6]. Formation of the autophagosome
requires class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Vps34)
[7], which forms a complex with the Atg6 (Beclin 1)
protein [8]. Autophagy can be also negatively regulated
by the mTOR signaling pathway, which is regulated by
Ras [9].
The Ras family of small GTPases transmit
extracellular signals, which are initiated by cell-surface
receptors and serve to regulate diverse cellular processes

[20, 21]. FTS inhibits the growth of H-Ras-, K-Ras- and
N-Ras-transformed rodent fibroblasts in vitro [22, 23]. In
addition, FTS can inhibit the anchorage-dependent growth
of LNCaP, PC3 and CWR-R1 cells [24, 25]. Furthermore,
FTS inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of cancer cell
lines such as hepatocarcinoma and prostate cancer [25,
26]. In a number of cancers, however, tumor cells do not

undergo apoptosis when treated with FTS. These include
pancreatic [27], colon [28, 29] and lung cancer cell lines
that express mutant K-Ras [30], an important target for
FTS.
In this in-vitro study we examined the impact of
FTS on autophagy and cell growth, in mouse embryonic
fibroblsts (MEFs) and in various human cancer cell

lines, and determined the contribution of autophagy to
cell viability in response to FTS treatment. Our results
demonstrated that FTS both induces autophagy and
inhibits cell growth. They further showed that inhibition of
autophagy promotes FTS-induced cell death and inhibition
of cell growth.

were determined in wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) and in Atg5-/- MEFs that do not
undergo autophagy because Atg5 is required both for
autophagy and for LC3-II formation [34]. First, we
verified the inability of Atg5-/- MEFs to undergo autophagy
under standard autophagy-inducing conditions. Cells
were cultured under normal conditions (in DMEM) or
under conditions of nutrient (amino-acid) deprivation
(in EBSS). Figure 1A shows that lysates of WT MEFs
contain both LC3-I (the non-lipidated form) and LC3II proteins, whereas Atg5-/- MEF lysates express only
LC3-I. Under nutrient deprivation, WT MEFs exhibited
enhanced autophagy flux as reflected by the marked
decrease in LC3-II. This apparent consumption of
LC3-II could be inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (a specific
inhibitor of vacuolar type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) that
inhibits fusion of autophagosomes with the lysosome,
thereby blocking autophagy). In Atg5-/- MEFs, however,
no change in LC3-I levels was observed under the same
conditions and no LC3-II protein was observed. We also
examined the expression level of p62/SQSTM1, a protein
that binds to LC3 and is degraded by autophagy [35]. As
shown, under the same conditions, p62 was reduced in WT
MEFs but not in Atg5-/- MEFs. Taken together these results

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Recent studies suggest that inhibition of autophagy
may become a new strategy for cancer therapy. Those
studies demonstrated that some cancers depend on
autophagy for survival during external stresses such as
hypoxia, chemotherapy or radiotherapy [31]. Other studies
have suggested the possible involvement of both Ras and
autophagy in cancer cell transformation [32, 33]. It was
not known, however, whether inhibition of Ras by small
molecules can affect autophagy. The present study was
aimed at determining the effect of Ras inhibition by FTS
(Salirasib) on autophagy and on cell viability.
For assessment of autophagy, we used LC3 protein
as a marker. When autophagy is induced this protein
undergoes lipidation, and the lipidated LC3 (LC3-II)
marks the autophagosomal membrane [6]. LC3 levels

The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclei were stained with bisbenzimide (Hoecsht 33258). Following fixation and

strongly suggest that Atg5-/-MEFs indeed cannot undergo
autophagy.
Next we examined whether autophagy can be
induced by FTS. To measure autophagic flux, cells were
treated with FTS in the presence or absence of bafilomycin
A1. As shown in Figure 1B, in WT MEFs, in the absence of
bafilomycin A1, LC3 levels decreased (reflecting enhanced
autophagy), but LC3-II was increased upon addition of the
inhibitor. These findings suggest that the FTS treatment
induced autophagy in WT MEFs. Figure 1B shows,
however, that in Atg5-/- MEFs (which are constitutionally
incapable of autophagy), LC3 levels were unaffected by
treatment with FTS. To further study the FTS-induced
autophagy, we examined the expression levels of p62/
SQSTM1 in the FTS-treated cells. FTS at 50‒75µM
enhanced p62 degradation in the WT MEFs, presumably
due to autophagy. At 100 µM, however, FTS induced an
increase in p62 possibly as a result of p62 synthesis. At
this concentration, furthermore, there was no significant
difference between bafilomycin A1-treated and -untreated
cells.
To further demonstrate autophagy induction, we
repeated the above experiment using WT MEFs stably
expressing GFP-LC3. As shown in Figure 2, FTS induced
enhanced autophagosome formation as reflected by
enhanced punctated staining of GFP-LC3. These findings
further support our results suggesting that FTS can induce
autophagy in MEFs.
We next examined whether FTS treatment affects

cell viability and, if so, whether the cell viability is
affected by autophagy induction. For these experiments
we again used WT MEFs and Atg5-/- MEFs. Cells
were treated with FTS at the indicated time periods or
concentrations, and cell viability was determined using
the methylene blue staining assay. As shown in Figure
3, FTS treatment significantly inhibited cell viability but
its effect was significantly more pronounced in the Atg5/MEFs (examined in two different clones) than in the WT
MEFs. These results suggest that although FTS inhibited
cell viability, autophagy induced by the FTS treatment
may have provided the cells with partial protection
from such inhibition. This conclusion is supported by
the results of two additional methods for detection of
cell death, namely flow cytometry and Hoechst dye
exclusion assay (Figure 4). FTS-induced cell death in
Atg5-/- MEFs was significantly more enhanced than in WT
MEFs, as indicated both by the increase in the sub-G1
population (Figure 4A) and by the high percentage of
Hoechst-positive cells (Figure 4B). Hence, our findings
strongly suggest that FTS treatment of WT MEFs induces
autophagy, which partially protects these cells from FTSinduced cell death and inhibition of cell growth.
Our findings of FTS-induced autophagy together
with inhibition of cell growth prompted us to investigate
whether these two effects of FTS are related and might
be of relevance to cancer cells. The cells we used for
this purpose were human cervical cancer (HeLa) and
human colon cancer (HCT-116 and DLD-1) cell lines.

First, we examined whether the observed effect of FTS
on autophagy induction is specific to MEFs or is also
applicable to other cells such as the above cancer cell
lines. As shown in Figure 5, FTS treatment induced
autophagy as judged by the enhanced conversion of
LC3-I to LC3-II. Moreover, p62 levels were decreased

by treatment with FTS compared to the control untreated
cells (Figure 5B). These results further confirmed the
ability of FTS treatment to induce autophagy. We also
examined the effect of FTS treatment on S-6-kinase (S6K)
phosphorylation (Figure 5C). Phosphorylated S6K was
reduced in MEF and HCT-116 cells but not in HeLa and

percentage of live cells at different cell cycle stages is indicated. (B) WT and Atg5-/- MEFs were treated for 4 days with FTS (75 µM or

of dead cells. After staining the cells were photographed with an Olympus optical inverted phase-contrast microscope Model IX70 (20×
magnification; scale bars, 100 µm). Left: Representative images. Right: In each field (10‒15 fields for each treatment) the percentage of
dying cells was estimated by counting the Hoechst-positive cells after each treatment, subtracting this number from the total number of

DLD-1 cells. Thus, only in certain cell types, FTS induced
autophagy may depend on mTOR inhibition. Next, we
inhibited autophagy induction using 3-methyladenine
and chloroquine and examined whether this would
affect the response of the cells to FTS treatment. As
shown in Figure 6, cell viability in response to FTS was
significantly lower in the presence than in the absence of
3-methyladenine or chloroquine. Of note, the effect of
FTS and 3- methyladenine treatment on Rat-1 fibroblasts
viability was significantly lower compared to the effect
of the treatment on Ras transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts
(EJ). To further examine the effect of Ras and autophagy
inhibition on cell viability, we have used the long-term
clonogenic assay (Figure 7). As shown, the combined
treatment significantly reduced the number of colonies.
Taken together, these results further supported the notion
that autophagy, induced by FTS, partially protects cancer
cells.

The precise role of autophagy in cancer depends on
the cellular context of the cells. A large number of studies,
summarized in a recent review [36], testify to the fact that
autophagy can be both tumorigenic and tumor suppressive.
Moreover, oncogenic Ras has been shown to be capable of
elevating the pro-survival activity of autophagy [32, 37,
38]. Other studies have shown, however, that Ras-driven
autophagy might be part of a pro-death mechanism. In
particular, H-Ras-induced autophagy was recently shown
to contribute to caspase-independent cell death [39]. It was
also demonstrated that Ras upregulates Beclin 1 and that
knockdown of the key autophagy genes Beclin 1, Atg5 or
Atg7 reduces oncogenic Ras-mediated cell death [39, 40].
The results of the present study show that the Ras inhibitor
FTS promoted autophagy in several cell lines. Our results
also point to a pro-survival function of autophagy, as
shown by the observation that in cells with impaired
autophagy the FTS-induced cell death and inhibition of

the methylene blue staining assay. Results are presented as percent of control; values are means ± S.D. of 4‒6 determinations. **, p < 0.01.

C6628) and bafilomycin A1 (B1793) were from Sigma.

cell growth were significantly enhanced, and is further
supported by confirmation of these results in three cancer
cell lines. In these cells, both FTS-induced autophagy
and inhibition of autophagy by the PI3K inhibitor,
3-methyladenine, enhanced FTS-mediated cell death. We
suggest that FTS, in addition to inhibiting proliferation
of cancer cells, induces pro-survival autophagy. Thus,
inhibition of both Ras and autophagy may have a better
effect on inhibition of cancer cell growth than inhibition
of Ras or autophagy alone.

Cell lines
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown
in DMEM or EBSS (Gibco/Life Technologies, Bethesda,
MD). The human cancer cell lines DLD-1, HCT-116
and HeLa were grown in RPMI-1640 (Gibco), McCoy’s
5A modified medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and DMEM,
respectively. Rat-1 fibroblast cells and H-Ras-transformed
Rat-1 cells (EJ cells) were grown in DMEM. All media
were supplemented with antibiotics and 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Thermo
Scientific, CITY, STATE). Cells were incubated at 37°C
in 5% CO2 in air, and the medium was changed every
3‒4 days. When 70% confluent, cells were passaged
in trypsin/disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel). One day
before treatment the cells were plated at ~50% confluence
in medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (10%
for EJ and Rat-1 cells). Concentrations for FTS treatments

as the duration of treatment where relevant, are indicated
for each experiment.

MEFs were stably transfected with the
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable clones
expressing LC3-GFP were selected and cultured with 500
µg/ml geneticin (G-418, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA).

HCT-116, DLD-1 and HELA cells were plated at a
density of 60*103, 50*103, 75*103 cells, respectively, onto
6-well plate, grown for 24 hr and then treated as indicated.
After treatment, the cells were detached and replated on
10-cm plates (1:10, 1:400, 1:40 dilution, respectively).
5,7,10 days later, respectively, the cells were fixed with
0.1% acetic acid in PBS and then stained with 0.4% crystal
violet in acetic acid. Total colonies area was calculated
using the ImageJ program

Assays of cell survival and cell death

Lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation

Cells were plated in medium supplemented with 5%
FBS and treated as indicated for the different experiments.
Cell numbers were determined by the methylene blue
assay. For this purpose, the cells were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 hours,
then washed once with 0.1 M boric acid (pH 8.5) and
incubated with the DNA-binding dye methylene blue (1%
in boric acid) for 20 minutes at room temperature. The
cells were then washed three times and lysed with 0.1 M
HCl. Absorbance was measured with a Tecan Spectrafluor
Plus spectrophotometer (Mannedorf, Switzerland) at 595
nm. Cell viability was calculated as the ratio of absorbance
in treated cultures to that in untreated control cultures.
Dead cells were scored by nuclear staining and nuclear
morphology. To estimate the number of dying cells, live
cells were incubated for 10 minutes with 1µg/ml of
the fluorescent DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258;
Sigma). After staining, the cells were photographed with
an Olympus optical inverted phase-contrast microscope
Model IX70 (20× magnification). The percentage of dead
cells was estimated by calculating the number of Hoechststained nuclei relative to the total cell number in each
field.

After the indicated treatment, cells were lysed in
solubilization buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA
pH 8, 1 mM EGTA pH 8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM
Na3VO4, 150 nM aprotinin, 1 µM leupeptin and 500 µM
4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride
(Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and
a boiling gel sample buffer was added. Lysates were
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis through 10%‒12.5% polyacrylamide gels,
and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in TBST
buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1%
Tween 20) containing 6% milk, and then blotted with
primary antibodies for 2 hours. Secondary antibody linked
to horseradish peroxidase was then added for 1 hour.
Immunoreactive bands were detected with the enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent.
