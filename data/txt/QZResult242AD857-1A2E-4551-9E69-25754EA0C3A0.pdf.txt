Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a cytosolic enzyme that protects cells against
chemical and radiation-induced oxidative stress and skin cancer. Disruption of NQO1 gene in mice
showed thinning of skin epithelium and loss of cytokeratin 14, an early marker of skin
differentiation. Immunohistochemistry and western analysis demonstrated downregulation of p63
in NQO1−/− mouse skin, as compared with wild-type (WT) mouse. Further analysis including
modulation of NQO1 expression revealed a direct correlation between the levels of NQO1 and p63
in skin-derived keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Modulation of proteasomal activity revealed
that p63 is degraded by 20S proteasome and that this degradation is significantly rescued by
NQO1. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that NQO1 interacts directly with p63 but not 20S
to protect against this degradation. In addition, benzo[a]pyrene treatment led to induction of
NQO1 and stabilization of p63 inWT but not in NQO1−/− mouse skin and keratinocytes. These
data suggest that NQO1 controls stabilization of p63 and progression towards keratinocyte
differentiation leading to normal skin development and presumably skin carcinogenesis.

Introduction
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a cytosolic phase II biotransformation
enzyme, which catalyzes two-electron reduction and detoxification of quinones (Ross et al.,
2000). Two-electron reduction of quinones catalyzed by NQO1 competes with one-electron
reduction of quinones catalyzed by cytochromes P450, and leads to the formation of
hydroquinone, a species that is quickly metabolized by other phase II biotransformation
enzymes and removed from the cells. Unlike NQO1, one-electron reduction of quinones
carried out by cytochrome P450 complexes leads to the formation of semiquinones and other
reactive oxygen species. Therefore, NQO1 is considered a protective enzyme. NQO1 is
ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (Talalay et al., 1995; Ross et al., 2000) and its

expression is increased in response to chemical and radiation exposure (Jaiswal, 2004).
NQO1 detoxifies benzo[a]pyrene (BP) quinones thus reducing the BP-induced mutagenicity
and carcinogenicity (Joseph and Jaiswal, 1994, 1998; Joseph et al., 1998).
The p53 family of transcription factors consists of p53, p63 and p73, each have multiple
isoforms, eliciting various effects on downstream regulators of cell cycle progression and
apoptosis (Moll and Slade, 2004; Pietsch et al., 2008). Though p63 is present in all tissues,
the role of p63 is most relevant to epithelial tissues such as skin (King and Weinberg, 2007;
Koster et al., 2007a, b; Candi et al., 2008). Such roles in dermal development are still being
elucidated, although knockout mouse studies have confirmed that the loss of p63 is
sufficient to prevent normal epithelial development (Yang et al., 1999). The p63−/− mice
die at or before birth, lacking skin and with profound limb underdevelopment, which can be
partially rescued by returning p63 expression to the mice, suggesting the vital role(s) played
by p63 in skin differentiation (Mills et al., 1999).

BP is a potent environmental carcinogen, which is capable of inducing considerable DNA
damage and cell toxicity (Gelboin, 1980). Conversion of BP into metabolites is required for
toxicity, and is mediated mainly by CYP450, a process that leads to production of quinones
and reactive oxygen species (Guengerich, 1988). NQO1, expression of which and activity
are induced following exposure to xenobiotics and other sources of oxidative stress (Talalay
et al., 1995; Radjendirane et al., 1997), exhibits activity against these quinone metabolites,
and this quinone detoxifying activity has been well-characterized as one mechanism for
NQO1 protection against BP-induced mutagenicity and carcinogenesis (Joseph and Jaiswal,
1994, 1998; Joseph et al., 1998).
In this report, we demonstrate that inactivation of NQO1 gene in mice led to the loss of
cytokeratin 14 (K14), an early marker of skin differentiation and thinning of skin epithelium.
Previous studies from our laboratory have shown increased sensitivity of NQO1−/− mice to
BP-induced skin cancer (Long et al., 2000). NQO1−/− mouse skin, as compared with wildtype (WT) mouse demonstrated downregulation of p63. Further analysis including
modulation of NQO1 expression revealed a direct correlation between the levels of NQO1
and p63 in skin-derived keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that p63
is degraded by 20S proteasomes. NQO1 physically interacts with p63 and protects against
20S proteasomal degradation of p63. This leads to the stabilization of p63, increased
expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers, which may provide the mechanism
leading to normal skin epithelium development and protection against BP-induced skin
carcinogenesis.

Results
Studies using NQO1−/− mice show that in skin, as in all tissues, NQO1 expression and
activity is essentially lost and cannot be detected (Long II et al., 2000). H&E stained skin
sections from WT, NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− were compared and analyzed for lesions
(Figure 1a). Intriguingly, NQO1−/− skin sections showed thinning of epithelium, as
compared with WT mice skin. NQO2−/− skin sections did not demonstrate thinning of
epithelium as observed in NQO1−/− mice. Immunohistochemistry of skin sections from
WT, NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mice revealed significantly decreased p63 and downstream
gene keratin 14 in the NQO1-null but not NQO2-null mice (Figures 1b and c). Western
analysis of these mice skin supported the immunohistochemistry results showing a decrease
in keratin 14 in NQO1−/− but not NQO2−/− skin (Figure 1c). Interestingly, NQO1−/− mice
have demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity to development of BP and 7,12dimethylbenzanthracene-induced skin tumors, as compared with WT mice (Long et al.,
2000, 2001). Most of the tumors were squamous cell papilloma and some were carcinomas.

Western analysis of skin tissue demonstrated that the expression of p63 was strongly
downregulated in NQO1−/− skin, as well as in skin from NQO1/NQO2 double-knockout
mice, whereas mice lacking only NQO2 did not lack p63 (Figure 2a). Epidermal
keratinocyte cell lines derived from BP-induced skin tumors in these mice also showed
similar downregulation of p63 in cells lacking NQO1 expression, whereas no similar effect
on p63 was observed in mice and cell lines lacking NQO2, with the ΔNp63α isoform
existing as the dominant isoform (Figure 2b). These results together with
immunohistochemistry observations (Figure 1b) suggested that NQO1 and not NQO2
regulated p63 in mouse skin. The relationship between NQO1 and p63 expression was
further explored as p63 is known to have a significant role in the development of skin
epithelium (Yang et al., 1999). We included primary dermal fibroblasts because of problems
inherent in keratinocyte transfection efficiency. Overexpression of NQO1 in dermal
fibroblasts led to the significant increase in p63 expression (Figure 2c), whereas knockdown
of endogenous NQO1 expression with small interfering RNA led to the profound loss of p63
expression, which while variable in extent was consistently significant across experiments
(Figure 2d). This loss of endogenous p63 expression was blocked and in fact p63 levels
were stabilized to levels above physiological levels due to inhibition of steady-state
proteasomal degradation, however, by pretreatment with the well-characterized proteasome
inhibitor MG-132, suggesting that NQO1 controls the stability of p63 and such stability is
mediated through proteasomal degradation. In the same experiment, positive control p53
followed same pattern as p63 and reported earlier (Gong et al., 2007).
Quantitative PCR experiments revealed that there was a decrease in p63 RNA transcripts in
NQO1-null keratinocytes and tissues relative to WT controls. However, the percentage
decrease of RNA in these cells and tissues was much smaller than the percentage decrease of
protein levels observed in NQO1-null samples (Figures 2a and b). These findings suggest
that although NQO1 may exert some transcriptional control over p63, the more significant
mechanism by which NQO1 can control p63 expression is likely to be at the level of protein
stability.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch has been previously investigated as a negative regulator of p63
expression in some systems (Melino et al., 2008), and so was an initial target of our studies
on NQO1 control of Itch as means to control p63. Western blot studies revealed, however,
that there was no significant increase in Itch expression in NQO1-null keratinocytes (Figure
3a), suggesting that this system is not primarily responsible for decreased p63 in these cells.
NQO1 is known to protect p53 family members p53 and p73 against 20S proteasomal
degradation (Asher et al., 2005; Gong et al., 2007). 20S proteasomes degrade
unubiquitinated p53. In response to stress, NQO1 is induced to interfere with 20S
degradation of p53 (Gong et al., 2007). This leads to the stabilization of p53 and cellular
protection. Therefore, the role of NQO1 in protection against ubiquitin-independent 20S
proteasomal degradation was investigated. In vitro translated ΔNp63α and p53 when
incubated with purified 20S proteasomes led to the degradation of both proteins within 2 h
(Figures 3b–d). We then investigated what effect NQO1 may have on this proteasomal
degradation using in vitro degradation assays, and discovered that indeed, NQO1 along with
cofactor NADH is sufficient to protect ΔNp63α isoform from 20S-mediated destruction
(Figure 3b, upper panels). This result was similar as observed with NQO1/NADH protection
of p53 against 20S proteasomal degradation (Figure 3b, Lower Panels; Gong et al., 2007).
Inclusion of dicoumarol, a competitive inhibitor of NADH binding to NQO1, inhibited
NQO1/NADH protection of ΔNp63α against 20S proteasomal degradation (Figure 3c). We
then examined the role of known mutations in NQO1, such as the tyrosine 126–128 area of
the L5 loop, which has been identified as relevant to NAD(P)H binding and in p53
interaction (Asher et al., 2006), as well as the clinically-relevant proline–serine 187
mutation, which interferes with NQO1 protein stability and therefore possible ability to

regulate stability of other factors (Chen et al., 2000). In in vitro degradation assays we
compared ΔNp63α degradation by purified 20S proteasome without NQO1 (No NQO1),
with WT NQO1, and mutants (Y126/128A, P187S), which were constructed and verified in
our laboratory. We observed that while WT NQO1 and the P1287S mutated form both
protected ΔNp63α against 20S-mediated degradation over 4 h, the Y126/129A mutated form
of NQO1 did not have the same protective effect (Figure 3d). This suggests that one or both
tyrosines at 126/128 in the L5 loop of NAD(P)H and quinone binding pocket has a key role
in NQO1–ΔNp63α interactions, which stabilize ΔNp63α. The proline at 187, although
clinically relevant (Chen et al., 2000), does not appear to directly regulate protection of
ΔNp63α against 20S proteasomal degradation. The role of ubiquitin-independent
proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α was further explored using A31N-ts20 mouse
fibroblasts. These cells express a thermosensitive E1 ubiquitin ligase, which is active at 35
but inactive at 39 °C (Salvat et al., 2000). Results indicate that ΔNp63α stability is
dependent on NQO1 expression, as is evident by decrease of ΔNp63α expression following
NQO1 knockdown. The extent of ΔNp63α degradation subsequent to the loss of NQO1 at
ubiquitin-permissive 35 °C is similar to the extent observed at ubiquitin-inactive 39 °C
(Figure 3e), which suggests that the role of ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteasomal
degradation of ΔNp63α is relatively minor in comparison with ubiquitin-independent 20Smediated degradation. These results were similar as observed with p53 (Figure 3e) and
published earlier (Gong et al., 2007). It is noteworthy that changing of culture temperature
from 35 to 39 °C led to an increase in p53 but not in p63 (Figure 3e compare lanes 1 with 4).
This suggested that p53 and not p63 is also degraded through ubiquitination/26S
proteasomes.

Subsequently, we investigated whether, similar to what we have previously reported with
p53 (Gong et al., 2007), NQO1 is directly interacting with ΔNp63α alone to inhibit
proteasome-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that
ΔNp63α is capable of interaction with 20S proteasome (Figure 4a), and similarly we
determined that ΔNp63α is directly interacting with NQO1. We then investigated whether,
similar to what has been reported to occur with p73 (Asher et al., 2005) as opposed to what
has been reported by us to occur with p53, NQO1 is directly interacting with the 20S
proteasome to prevent degradation of ΔNp63α. Immunoprecipitation studies found no
interaction between NQO1 and 20S proteasome (Figure 4a). These results indicate that
while ΔNp63α interacts directly with and is degraded significantly by the 20S proteasomal
complex, NQO1 is capable of interacting with and protecting ΔNp63α against 20S-mediated
degradation and this effect appears to occur without direct interaction with the 20S complex
itself. This further suggested that the pool of ΔNp63α protein, which interacts with NQO1 is
separate from the pool which interacts with the 20S proteasome, and that direct interaction
between NQO1 and ΔNp63α prevents interaction and eventual degradation by 20S
proteasome. We next looked to determine if the sterile alpha motif (Arrowsmith, 1999)
domain of ΔNp63α has a role in NQO1–ΔNp63α interactions. In this regard we performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments with cells cotransfected with WT NQO1-V5 and either
Flag-tagged ΔNp63α or ΔNp63γ. We found that there was no decrease in NQO1–p63
interaction with the SAM-lacking ΔNp63γ isoform, compared with NQO1–ΔNp63α
interaction (Figure 4b). This suggests that the SAM may not be an important domain of p63
in its stability against 20S proteasomal degradation. We then investigated whether the
NQO1 mutations investigated earlier, which affected 20S-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α
would affect direct interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation studies in cells cotransfected with
Flag-tagged ΔNp63α and either WT NQO1-V5, NQO1-Y127/129A-V5 or NQO1-P187S-V5
revealed that interaction between NQO1 and Flag-tagged ΔNp63α does indeed require the
Y127/129 residues to be intact but not the P187 residue, as in only the Y127/129A mutant
interaction was significantly decreased, not in the P187S mutant (Figure 4c).

Subsequent studies were performed to determine the physiological relevance of NQO1mediated protection of ΔNp63α in response to classical models of carcinogenesis and stressresponse. These in vivo and in vitro studies involved the well-characterized environmental
carcinogen BP and the antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone, which induces upregulation of
antioxidant response element-mediated enzymes such as NQO1. In both WT skin tissues and
keratinocytes the induction of NQO1 by BP was followed by strong ΔNp63α upregulation,
whereas induction was strongly muted in NQO1−/− tissues and keratinocytes (Figure 5a).
Similarly, tert-butylhydroquinone induction of NQO1 was followed by ΔNp63α
upregulation in WT but not NQO1−/− keratinocytes (Figure 5b). Follow-up studies in the
same tumor-derived keratinocytes showed that induction of NQO1 through stress-response
pathways, such as ultraviolet light and gamma ionizing irradiation, also led to significant
increase in ΔNp63α expression as determined by densitometry (Figures 5c and d). These
data strongly suggest that NQO1 induction is crucial to the increase in expression of
ΔNp63α following exposure to environmental stressors.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is an established fact that ΔNp63α significantly contributes to the development of normal
skin epithelium (Mills et al., 1999; Yang et al., 1999). Therefore, the observation of thinning
of epithelium in NQO1−/− skin suggested a connection between NQO1 and ΔNp63α.
Further studies indeed revealed that ΔNp63α was downregulated in skin from NQO1−/−
mice. The NQO2−/− mice skin showed normal levels of ΔNp63α and absence of thinning of
skin epithelium. These studies together revealed that NQO1 and not NQO2 regulated
ΔNp63α and normal development and protection of skin epithelium.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The downregulation of ΔNp63α in NQO1−/− mice also raised an interesting question. How
does NQO1 regulate ΔNp63α? The experiments demonstrated that the modulation of NQO1
levels led to the parallel changes in ΔNp63α levels. In addition, NQO1 small interfering
RNA-mediated loss of ΔNp63α was rescued by proteasome inhibition. These results
suggested that NQO1 protected specifically against proteasomal-mediated degradation of
ΔNp63α. Further studies showed that NQO1 protected against 20S proteasomal degradation
of ΔNp63α. This was confirmed by in vitro studies showing that purified 20S proteasome,
lacking the 19S component of the larger 26S complex, is capable of degradation of ΔNp63α.
These studies also show that the presence of NQO1 is sufficient to protect ΔNp63α protein
levels, establishing that NQO1 is capable of interfering with 20S-mediated ΔNp63α
degradation. The results also revealed that NQO1 protection against 20S proteasomal
degradation of ΔNp63α requires NADH binding to NQO1. This was evident from the
requirement of NADH for complete protection against 20S degradation of ΔNp63α and the
dicoumarol inhibition of NQO1 protection against 20S degradation of ΔNp63α and the loss
of protection in case of NADH-binding mutant NQO1Y127/129A. Dicoumarol is a
competitive inhibitor of binding of NADH to NQO1. This also raises interesting questions
regarding the role of NADH in NQO1 protection against 20S degradation of p63. As is
revealed through IP studies, the NQO1 protection occurs by directly binding to ΔNp63α and
not to 20S itself. The loss of this protection in NQO1−/− mice led to the downregulation of
ΔNp63α and thinning of skin epithelium. The thinning of epithelium could have been due to
decreased differentiation of epithelial cells and/or damage due to endogenous/environmental
stress response(s).
It is noteworthy that NQO1 also contributes to the transcription of p63 as evident from
significantly decreased NQO1 transcripts in skin tissues from NQO1−/− mice, as compared
with WT mice. The NQO1 control of transcription of p63 is in addition to its role in
stabilization of p63 protein. Therefore, both stabilization of protein and increase in
transcription contribute to NQO1-mediated regulation of p63. The NQO1 control of p63

transcription has to be mediated through NQO1 regulation of factor(s) that regulate
transcription of p63 and signaling pathway remains to be determined.

NQO1 is a stress responsive gene (Jaiswal, 2004). The expression of NQO1 is coordinately
activated along with another 200+ genes in response to chemical and radiation stress
(Jaiswal, 2004). This was also evident from increased expression of NQO1 in response to
BP, antioxidant and ultraviolet light light (Present studies). This induction is critical in
protection against damage to skin, against exposure to chemicals and radiation. NQO1mediated protection of ΔNp63α allows accumulation of ΔNp63α in keratinocytes and
subsequent accumulation of ΔNp63α-downstream keratinocyte differentiation genes such as
K14 (Romano et al., 2009) and in addition, may constitute a mechanism for the wellestablished protection (Radjendirane et al., 1998).

The role of ΔNp63α in chemical/radiation-induced skin cancer is expected but remains
controversial (Moll and Slade, 2004). Both NQO1−/− and NQO2−/− mice demonstrate
significantly increased sensitivity to BP and dimethylbenzanthracece-induced skin
carcinogenesis, as compared with WT mice (Long et al., 2000, 2001; Iskander et al., 2004).
The studies have also suggested that lower induction of p53 and apoptosis in NQO1−/− and
NQO2−/− mice led to skin carcinogenesis (Gong et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2010). It is
possible that lack of induction of ΔNp63α and proper differentiation of epithelial cells also
contributed to skin carcinogenesis. This might also explain higher sensitivity of NQO1−/−
to skin carcinogenesis than NQO2−/− mice (Long et al., 2000, 2001; Iskander et al., 2004).
A hypothetical model of NQO1–ΔNp63α interaction in epidermal tissues shows that in WT,
NQO1-positive cells and skin tissues, ΔNp63α is protected against 20S-mediated
proteasomal degradation because of sequestration by NQO1 in cytosol (Figure 6). It is
important to note that this hypothesis for protection of ΔNp63α by NQO1 does not require
that NQO1 interact directly with the 20S proteasome but hypothesizes that NQO1 may
interact with ΔNp63α at some region, which is different from the region with which ΔNp63α
interacts with the 20S proteasome (to facilitate normal 20S-mediated ΔNp63α degradation).
This lack of interaction between NQO1 and 20S proteasome has been observed before in our
previous studies regarding NQO1 protection of p53 from 20S-mediated proteasomal
degradation (Gong et al., 2007). This protection allows buildup of ΔNp63α within the cell,
which is then available for ΔNp63α-mediated downstream biological effects such as
induction of markers of keratinocyte differentiation (for example, K14) (Fuchs, 1996), and
thereby allowing correct physiological differentiation of skin tissues. ΔNp63α is degraded
and does not induce in NQO1−/− mice deficient in NQO1. This leads to loss of protection,
thinning of epithelium and presumably skin cancer.

Animals were euthanized with isofluorane according to IACUC-approved protocols and skin
was removed using scissors. Shaved skin patches were fixed in formalin solution (Sigma)
overnight and afterwards placed into cassettes and embedded in paraffin at University of
Maryland Dermatopathology Laboratory. Paraffin blocks were sliced and sections were
affixed to charged slides. Slides were hydrated in xylene, 100% EtOH, 95, 90, 70, 30%,
followed by peroxidase blocking with 3% H2O2/MeOH, Retrievagen antigen retrieval (BD
Pharmingen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) at ~95 °C for 30 min, blocking 30 min in 5% goat
serum/TBS-T, washing, and primary antibodies (1:1000 p63 4A4 or 1:50 K14) for 1 h,
washing, followed by secondary antibody for 30 min, horse radish peroxidase developing
for 10 min, DAB for 25 s, and hematoxylin counterstaining for 3 min, all according to
manufacturers recommendations (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by dehydration
in EtOH and xylene, and sealing under coverslips with Permount (Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Slides were photographed with Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope
under Plan Apo ×20/0.75 DIC N2 WD 1.0 and Plan Apo ×40/0.95 DIC M/N2 WD 0.14
objectives, and fields were rotated as necessary to match. Nikon NIS-Elements BR 3.0
software was used with the microscope, along with DS-Fi1 bright-field camera. All
photography was done at room temperature and files saved as jpeg format with each field
subjected to ‘auto-white balance’ before capturing, with no other manipulation.

Expression of NQO1 is concomitant with expression of ΔNp63α in mouse skin and skinderived keratinocytes. (a) Expression of ΔNp63α is dependent on the presence of NQO1 in
vivo. Mice aged 7–10 weeks were euthanized and shaved, and skin was collected and frozen,
and homogenized in RIPA. Aliquots were run on 10% gel and probed against GAPDH,
NQO1, NQO2, p53 and ΔNp63α. A bar graph shows the percentage decrease of protein
levels (measured by densitometry and normalized to wild type (WT) mice) compared with
WT mice relative to the percentage decrease in RNA (measured by qPCR and normalized to
WT mice). A number >1.0 indicates that the decrease in protein levels exceeds the decrease
in RNA levels. (b) Expression of ΔNp63α is dependent on the presence of NQO1 in vitro.
Mouse-derived keratinocytes were plated in 10 cm dishes and harvested in RIPA, run on
10% gel, and probed against GAPDH, NQO1, NQO2, p53 and p63-HRP. A bar graph shows
the percentage decrease of protein levels (measured by densitometry and normalized to WT)
compared with WT relative to the percentage decrease in RNA (measured by qPCR and
normalized to WT mice). (c) NQO1 overexpression in primary dermal fibroblasts leads to
the upregulation of ΔNp63α. Cells were plated into 10 cm dishes and transfected with either
empty vector or pcDNA-NQO1-V5 for 48 h, harvested in RIPA, then run on 10% gel and
probed against GAPDH, NQO1 and p63-HRP. The cells were also analyzed for p63 RNA
by qPCR. The bar diagram on right shows NQO1 and p63 band intensities. Bar diagram on
bottom shows ΔNp63α RNA levels relative to control. (d) Knockdown of NQO1 leads to

NQO1 protects against 20S-mediated ubiquitin-independent degradation of ΔNp63α. (a)
Itch expression is not increased in NQO1−/− keratinocytes. Cells were plated for 24 h in 10
cm dishes and aliquots were probed for Itch, ΔNp63α and α-actin. (b) NQO1/NADH

degradation buffer at 37 °C for 2 h with or without recombinant NQO1 and NADH (1 mM).
Reactions were quenched with sample buffer and analyzed by western blotting. (c)
Dicoumarol inhibits NQO1/NADH protection against 20S degradation of ΔNp63α. In vitrotranslated ΔNp63α was incubated with 20S and/or NQO1 and/or 1 mM NADH and/or 300µM
dicoumarol to determine the effect of specific inhibition of NADH binding to NQO1 on
ΔNp63α stability. Western blotting analyzed ΔNp63α NQO1 and 20S. (d) Mutations in

Product from 1 µg of recombinant ΔNp63α was incubated at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2 and 4 h with 2
µg 20S proteasome in degradation buffer with either in vitro-translated WT NQO1 or
NQO1-V5 mutated at either Y126/128A or P187S with 1 mM NADH to determine the effect
of these mutations of NQO1 on ΔNp63α stability. Western blotting analyzed ΔNp63α
NQO1-V5 and 20S. Bar graph below is densitometry: dark bars are values at 0 h and white
bars are corresponding values at 4 h, each normalized to 0 h values. (e) NQO1 stabilizes
against ubiquitin-independent degradation of ΔNp63α and p53. E1 ligase-thermosensitive
A31N ts20 fibroblasts were transefected in 6 cm dishes at 35 °C with siNQO1 or control
siRNA for 48 h and one set transferred to ubiquin-inactive 39 °C for 24 h before lysis.
Densitometry of bands are shown below western blots.

Physiological significance of NQO1 regulation of ΔNp63α stability. (a) Benzo[a]pyrene
induction of NQO1 leads to ΔNp63α upregulation in skin and skin cells. WT and NQO1−/−
mice were shaved and either 100 µl of acetone or 1200 nmol of benzo[a]pyrene in acetone
was applied to skin. After 24 h, mice were euthanized and skin was collected and frozen,
and samples were prepared in RIPA buffer and run on 10% gel, and probed against GAPDH,
NQO1 and p63 HRP. In cells, WT and NQO1−/− keratinocytes were plated in 10 cm dishes
and exposed to 1800 nmol benzo[a]pyrene in DMSO for 24 h, then harvested in RIPA buffer
and run on 10% gel, and probed against GAPDH, NQO1 and p63 HRP. (b) Antioxidant
response-mediated induction of NQO1 leads to ΔNp63α the upregulation in keratinocytes.
WT and NQO1−/− keratinocytes were plated in 10 cm dishes and exposed to tertbutylhydroquinone (tBHQ) in DMSO for 24 h, then harvested in RIPA buffer and run on
10% gel, and probed against GAPDH, NQO1 and p63 HRP. (c) Stress-response induction of
NQO1 in tumor-derived keratinocytes induces ΔNp63α. Cells were plated in 10 cm dishes
and subjected to 0–30J/m2 UVB, followed by 4 h rest at 37 °C and probed against GAPDH,
NQO1 and p63 HRP. (d) Induction of NQO1 in tumor-derived keratinocytes leads to the

Hypothetical model of NQO1-mediated protection of ΔNp63α against 20S proteasomal
degradation in cells. In WT (NQO1-positive) cells, NQO1 can directly interact with and
prevent some ΔNp63α interaction with 20S proteasome, sparing ΔNp63α protein levels,
thereby allowing p63-mediated processes such as keratinocyte differentiation. During stress,
NQO1 induction allows increased ΔNp63α protection. In NQO1−/− cells, loss of NQO1
leaves ΔNp63α unprotected and therefore more likely to undergo 20S-mediated degradation,
decreasing the intracellular ΔNp63α pool and thereby decreasing ΔNp63α-mediated
processes. During stress, only limited ΔNp63α induction is possible due to lack of
stabilizing activity from NQO1.
