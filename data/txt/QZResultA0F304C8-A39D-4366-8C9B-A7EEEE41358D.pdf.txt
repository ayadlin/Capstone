Mediated by Formation of a Redox-Active Copper Complex
That Accumulates in Lysosomes

Abstract
The metal-chelating compound Dp44mT is a di-2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone (DpT) which displays
potent and selective antitumor activity. This compound is receiving translational attention, but its mechanism is
poorly understood. Here, we report that Dp44mT targets lysosome integrity through copper binding. Studies
using the lysosomotropic fluorochrome acridine orange established that the copper–Dp44mT complex
(Cu[Dp44mT]) disrupted lysosomes. This targeting was confirmed with pepstatin A–BODIPY FL, which showed
redistribution of cathepsin D to the cytosol with ensuing cleavage of the proapoptotic BH3 protein Bid. Redox
activity of Cu[Dp44mT] caused cellular depletion of glutathione, and lysosomal damage was prevented by
cotreatment with the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine. Copper binding was essential for the potent
antitumor activity of Dp44mT, as coincubation with nontoxic copper chelators markedly attenuated its
cytotoxicity. Taken together, our studies show how the lysosomal apoptotic pathway can be selectively activated
in cancer cells by sequestration of redox-active copper. Our findings define a novel generalized strategy
to selectively target lysosome function for chemotherapeutic intervention against cancer. Cancer Res; 71(17);

Introduction
Neoplastic cells have high requirements for iron (Fe) due to
their generally higher rates of proliferation than normal cells
(1). In fact, neoplastic cells express enhanced transferrin
receptor 1 (TfR1) levels relative to their normal counterparts
(2) and take up Fe from transferrin (Tf) at a rapid rate (3),
making them selectively sensitive to Fe chelation. Cancer cells
also take up more copper (Cu) than their normal counterparts,
as this metal is essential for angiogenesis and metastasis (4).
Considering the crucial roles of these metals, development of
novel Fe and Cu chelators has become a promising anticancer
strategy (1, 5). Indeed, the chelator, Triapine (3-aminopyridine2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone; Fig. 1), which inhibits
tumor growth, has entered clinical trials (1). However, the di2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone (DpT) chelators possess far
greater antitumor activity and selectivity than Triapine (6, 7).

One of the most effective DpT chelators is di-2-pyridylketone-4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT; Fig. 1; ref.
6). Dp44mT shows marked and selective activity against
tumor xenografts in mice (6, 7). The proposed mechanism
of action of Dp44mT involves Fe chelation and redox cycling of
its Fe complex to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs.
6, 8, 9). The potent and antitumor activity of Dp44mT has been
verified by others (10–12). In particular, Rao and colleagues
reported topoisomerase IIa inhibition (10) and broad and
specific antitumor activity (12). Additional modes of anticancer activity reported for Dp44mT include inhibition of the
metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg-1 (1), and modulation of
the cell-cycle control proteins of the cyclin family (A, B, D1, D2,
and D3) as well as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (1, 5).
Dp44mT not only binds Fe, but also Cu, and both complexes
are redox active, contributing to their marked cytotoxicity
(13). Considering: (i) the potential of lysosomes as a therapeutic target; (ii) their key role in metal metabolism (14, 15);
and (iii) their pronounced susceptibility to ROS (15, 16), our
goals were to examine the effects of the DpT compounds on
Cu and Fe and their interaction with lysosomes. Our work has
elucidated a novel strategy for the design of new therapeutics
that activate the lysosomal apoptotic pathway by binding
redox-active Cu.

described (6, 8). Desferrioxamine (DFO) was from Novartis.
Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), D-penicillamine (D-pen), tetrathiomolybdate (TM), and Trientine (Trien) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Triapine was from Vion Pharmaceuticals.
Cell culture
Human SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells, MCF-7 breast
cancer cells, DMS-53 lung carcinoma cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and grown as described (17,
18). Cells were used within 2 months of purchase after
resuscitation of frozen aliquots. Cell lines were authenticated
on the basis of viability, recovery, growth, morphology, and
also cytogenetic analysis, antigen expression, DNA profile, and
isoenzymology by the provider.
Procedures involved in preparing 59Fe-transferrin and conducting cytotoxicity assays have been described previously
(17, 18).
Cu and 59Fe efflux assays
Efflux studies examining the ability of chelators to mobilize 59Fe or 64Cu (10 mCi/mL; 64CuCl2; ANSTO) from cells
were done by standard methods (17). Briefly, cells were
prelabeled for 3 hours at 37 C with 64Cu (10 mCi) or 59Fetransferrin (59Fe-Tf; 0.75 mmol/L), washed 4 times on ice and
reincubated with medium (control) or medium and chelators (25 mmol/L) for up to 6 hours at 37 C and then
harvested (17). Radioactivity was measured in the pellet
and supernatant using a g-scintillation counter (Wallac
Wizard 3; Perkin Elmer).

Cellular retention of 64Cu complexes
Complexes were prepared by adding equimolar 64Cu and
chelator. SK-N-MC cells were incubated with the complexes
for 3 hours at 37 C, washed 4 times on ice, reincubated for 3
hours at 37 C in control media, and the percentage of 64Cu
remaining cell associated assessed (17).
Subcellular fractionation
SK-N-MC cells (3  T175 flasks, 80% confluent) were
prelabeled for 3 hours at 37 C with 64Cu (10 mCi), washed
and reincubated at 37 C with medium (control) or Dp44mT (5
mmol/L) for 3 hours at 37 C. Cells were added to extraction
buffer (0.25 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl) and disrupted using a Dounce "B" homogenizer on ice. To prevent
damage to the released lysosomes, disruption of cells was
discontinued when approximately 50% of the intact cells were
disrupted. The suspension was centrifuged 1,000  g for 15
minutes at 4 C, the pellet discarded, and supernatant centrifuged at 16,000  g for 15 minutes at 4 C to yield a crude
lysosomal/mitochondrial fraction. As a further control,
enzyme marker analysis for the lysosomal specific enzyme
acid phosphatase (Sigma) showed that this fraction was
enriched with lysosomes (as determined by spectrophotometric assessment at 405 nm).

Potentiometric titrations were conducted as described (8).
Assessment of lysosomal membrane permeability
Distribution of acridine orange (Sigma) was used to determine lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) as previously
reported (18) and was quantified by flow cytometry (19).
Briefly, cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 37 C with
acridine orange (20 mmol/L), washed 3 times with PBS, and
then incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C with 25 mmol/L

chelator or reagent. Cathepsin D release was examined by
fluorescence microscopy as previously reported (20) using a
pepstatin A–BODIPY FL conjugate (Invitrogen) that selectively binds to cathepsin D. LysoTracker red (Invitrogen) was
used to confirm colocalization of cathepsin D with lysosomes.
For details, see Supplementary Methods.
Western blot analysis
Assessment of Bid cleavage was assessed by Western blotting by standard methods (6) using antibodies to Bid (Cell
Signaling Technology) and b-actin (clone AC-1; Sigma).
Mitochondrial stability assay
Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE; Invitrogen) partitions to the mitochondrial matrix (21). SK-N-MC cells were
incubated with 20 nmol/L of TMRE for 0.25 hours at 37 C and
then incubated with 5 mmol/L of Cu[Dp44mT] for 0.5 to 2
hours at 37 C. Mitochondrial damage was examined by flow
cytometry (21).
GSH/GSSG assay
This assay was conducted using a kit (Calbiochem). SK-NMC cells were treated at 25 mmol/L for up to 24 hours at 37 C
with Cu(II), Fe(III), Dp44mT, Cu[Dp44mT], or Fe[Dp44mT]2.
As a control, BSO (100 mmol/L) was added as a glutathione
synthesis inhibitor (22).
Redox studies: oxidation of H2DCF
Studies without cells were conducted as described with
H2DCF (5 mmol/L; ref. 23). As a positive control, Fe(III) at 5
mmol/L was reduced to Fe(II) using cysteine (100 mmol/L) in
150 mmol/L acetate buffer (pH ¼ 5.0). Hydrogen peroxide (100
mmol/L) was then added to initiate hydroxyl radical generation. To confirm hydroxyl radical production, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 10% v/v) was used, as it has been reported to be
an effective hydroxyl radical scavenger (24, 25). Cu[Dp44mT]
and other reagents (at 5 mmol/L, except DMSO at 10% v/v)
were added to examine hydroxyl radical production. Intracellular oxidation of H2DCF studies were conducted as described
in previous studies (6, 23).
Statistics
Data were compared using Student's t test. Results were
expressed as mean  SD (number of experiments) and
considered to be statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Results
Active DpT chelators prevent 64Cu mobilization but
markedly induce 59Fe efflux
To assess the antineoplastic mechanisms of the DpT analogues (Fig. 1), their ability to remove 64Cu from prelabeled
cells was compared with their interaction with 59Fe. The
activity of DpT chelators was compared with the Fe chelators,
DFO, PIH, and 311 (17), and Cu chelators, D-pen, Trien, and TM
(Fig. 1; ref. 1). The DpT chelators, Dp4mT, Dp44mT, Dp4eT,
Dp4aT, and Dp4pT, were found to be ineffective at 25 mmol/L
at inducing 64Cu release from cells (leading to 64Cu retention)

www.aacrjournals.org

relative to when cells were incubated with control medium
(Fig. 2A). In these studies, SK-N-MC cells were used as their
response to chelators is well characterized (6, 17).
The results above were in contrast to their ability to
mobilize 59Fe, where the DpT chelators significantly (P <
0.001) induced a more than 700% increase in 59Fe release
relative to control cells (Fig. 2B). Hence, there was a difference in the ability of DpT chelators to mobilize these metals.
The only exception was the negative control, Dp2mT, which
failed to induce significant 64Cu or 59Fe efflux (Fig. 2A and B).
By design, Dp2mT cannot bind metals (6), showing the
importance of metal binding for DpT chelator activity.
The chelators DFO, PIH, and 311 were included as positive
controls to increase 59Fe efflux, and we also examined their
effects on 64Cu release. Only 311 showed a marked interaction with 64Cu, significantly (P < 0.001) reducing its efflux to
43%  10% of the control (Fig. 2A). The Cu chelators, D-pen
and Trien, were ineffective at inducing 64Cu efflux at 25
mmol/L (Fig. 2A). However, the Cu chelator, TM, significantly
(P < 0.05) reduced 64Cu efflux to 76%  2% of the control.
The low activity of the Cu chelators, D-pen, Trien, and TM, at
mobilizing 64Cu was unexpected on the basis of their in vivo
efficacy (1). However, their mechanism of action in cell
culture is unclear, and the efficacy in vivo could relate to
extracellular rather than intracellular chelation (26). These
efflux experiments were repeated using MCF-7 (Fig. 2C and
D), and to provide a comparison with tumor cells, normal
HUVECs were used (Fig. 2E and F). Generally, the active
chelators accumulated 64Cu similarly across the 3 cell types
(Fig. 2A–F). In terms of the effect of Dp44mT on inhibiting
64
Cu release, its effect was greater in HUVECs and MCF-7
cells than SK-N-MC.
The kinetics of 64Cu and 59Fe release were assessed over a
range of reincubation times (0.5–6 hours) using SK-N-MC
cells and HUVECs that were prelabeled with 64Cu or 59Fe-Tf
for 3 hours at 37 C (Supplementary Fig. S1A–D). These
results showed that Dp44mT and 311 decreased 64Cu
release relative to the control while both ligands markedly
increased 59Fe efflux as a function of time. In addition,
dose–response curves showed that 311 and Dp44mT
decreased 64Cu release compared with the control, leading
to 64Cu accumulation in cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
With Dp44mT, this effect was reversible as its concentration
increased to more than 5 mmol/L, and at these higher
concentrations, cellular damage results in the release of
the Cu–Dp44mT complex from the cells. In contrast, at
lower concentrations, the cells are still intact preventing
64
Cu release. In terms of 59Fe efflux, 311 and Dp44mT
markedly increased cellular 59Fe release as a function of
concentration (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Collectively, the
active DpT group of chelators markedly prevented 64Cu
efflux from all cell types, leading to 64Cu accumulation.
Precomplexation of 64Cu with 311 and the DpT ligands
leads to intracellular accumulation of their 64Cu
complexes
The results indicating intracellular accumulation of
DpT–64Cu complexes were confirmed by studies where

SK-N-MC cells were labeled for 3 hours at 37 C with preformed 64Cu–chelator complexes. The cells were then washed
and reincubated for 3 hours at 37 C in control media and the
percentage of 64Cu remaining cell associated then quantified.
In control cells incubated with 64Cu only, only 4%  1% of
64
Cu remained intracellular (Fig. 3A). Hence, most 64Cu had
been released during the reincubation. Cells labeled with the
64
Cu complexes of the active DpT analogues (Dp4mT,
Dp44mT, Dp4eT, Dp4aT, and Dp4pT) and then reincubated
with control medium, showed that 39% to 68% of 64Cu
remained cell associated (Fig. 3A). In contrast, 64Cu complexes
of Dp2mT, D-pen, and Trien were no more effective than the
control at retaining intracellular 64Cu (Fig. 3A). The 64Cu–TM
complex also led to intracellular 64Cu accumulation relative to
the control. These results explain the low efflux of 64Cu
observed with the active DpT analogues (Fig. 2A), as their
64
Cu complexes become "trapped" within cells.

Subcellular fractionation indicates 64Cu[Dp44mT]
accumulates within a crude lysosomal/mitochondrial
fraction
To examine the subcellular localization of the accumulated
64
Cu, SK-N-MC cells were labeled for 3 hours at 37 C with
64
Cu, washed, and reincubated for 3 hours at 37 C with
Dp44mT (5 mmol/L) or control media. The distribution of
64
Cu in the cytosol and crude lysosomal/mitochondrial fraction was examined by differential centrifugation. In cells
reincubated with Dp44mT, a significantly (P < 0.001) greater
proportion of 64Cu accumulated in the lysosomal/mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 3B).
Considering this observation, we hypothesized that because
of the polyprotic nature of Dp44mT (8), it was trapped in
acidic lysosomes as it became positively charged. To assess
this, speciation studies of the chelator as a function of pH were
conducted. At a pH of 7.4, 100% of the ligand is in its neutral

state (Dp44mT), allowing facile transport through membranes, whereas at a lysosomal pH of 5, 16% is charged leading
to lysosomal accumulation (Dp44mTþ; Fig. 3C). It should be
noted that while 16% of the ligand is protonated at a pH of 5,
this leads to accumulation of the ligand over time. This occurs
due to the process of: (i) the neutral ligand entering the
lysosome; (ii) the ligand becoming protonated and charged
at lysosomal pH (pH ¼ 5), preventing its passage out of the
organelle; (iii) the charged ligand-binding copper in the lysosome; and (iv), as the so formed copper complex is probably
positively charged, it also cannot escape the lysosome
accounting for the 64Cu accumulation in this compartment
(see Fig. 3B).
Acridine orange indicates lysosomal permeabilization
by Cu[Dp44mT]
To further explore the potential effect of Dp44mT and its Cu
complex (Cu[Dp44mT]) on the lysosome, we implemented the
lysosomotropic fluorophore, acridine orange (Fig. 3D) that
accumulates within lysosomes (18). High lysosomal concentrations of acridine orange give a red fluorescence, whereas
lower cytosolic and nuclear concentrations give a green
fluorescence (18).
Examining control cells by fluorescence microscopy, a
granular red fluorescence consistent with acridine orange
concentration in lysosomes was found (Fig. 3D; ref. 18).

However, incubation of cells with 25 mmol/L of Cu[Dp44mT]
for 0.5 hours resulted in a marked loss of red fluorescence and
the disappearance of red vesicles consistent with increased
LMP, as well as the appearance of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, the Fe[Dp44mT]2 complex, Dp44mT, CuCl2, or
FeCl3 (at 25 mmol/L), had no significant effect relative to the
control (Fig. 3D). The lack of activity of Dp44mT or
Fe[Dp44mT]2 is due to the short incubation period (0.5 hours)
used, which was optimal for detecting the effect of
Cu[Dp44mT]. Indeed, Dp44mT and Fe[Dp44mT]2 only induce
significant cytotoxicity after 24 hours (Fig. 6A). These data
using fluorescence microscopy were confirmed upon quantification by flow cytometry, where only the Cu[Dp44mT]
complex (25 mmol/L) significantly (P < 0.001) reduced red
fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To further examine the effect of Cu[Dp44mT] on the
lysosome, we examined the intracellular distribution of
LysoTracker red and a lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin D
(18), utilizing a fluorescent probe (pepstatin A–BODIPY
FL) that binds to cathepsin D (20). Control cells stained
with LysoTracker red and pepstatin A–BODIPY FL showed a
granular/vesicular pattern consistent with lysosomes
(Fig. 4A). The overlay of LysoTracker red and pepstatin
A–BODIPY FL–stained cells showed colocalization. After a
0.5-hour incubation with 25 mmol/L of Cu[Dp44mT], the
granular, lysosomal type pattern disappeared, with the

Ability of the Cu-Dp44mT and Fe–Dp44mT complexes
to generate ROS
To understand why lysosomes were so sensitive to
Cu[Dp44mT], we assessed whether the Fe or Cu complexes
of Dp44mT generate oxidative stress that could damage
lysosomes. These studies in a cell-free system were conducted
under lysosomal like conditions at a pH of 5.0 and in the
presence of cysteine (ref. 28; Fig. 5A and B). Oxidative stress
was determined by the oxidation of nonfluorescent H2DCF to
fluorescent DCF, a well-characterized probe for assessing
redox stress (6, 23). The high redox activity of 5 mmol/L of
Cu[Dp44mT] was significantly (P < 0.01) greater than 5 mmol/
L of CuCl2, FeCl3, and Fe[Dp44mT]2 after only 2 minutes
(Fig. 5A). Addition of the 5 mmol/L of Cu chelator TM to 5
mmol/L of Cu[Dp44mT] totally prevented its activity, consistent with the ability of TM to bind Cu from Cu[Dp44mT], as
shown in Fig. 5A and B.

Considering these results, the potential of Cu[Dp44mT] to

(P < 0.001) increase in intracellular H2DCF oxidation to 273%
 20% of that found for control cells after a 0.5-hour incubation (Fig. 5C). No increase in H2DCF oxidation was observed
with Cu(II) as CuCl2, Fe(III) as FeCl3, Dp44mT alone, or

marked redox activity of Cu[Dp44mT].
Effect of Cu[Dp44mT] on GSH and GSSG levels
To examine the redox activity of Cu[Dp44mT] on physiologic substrates, levels of the well-described indicator of
oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH), and oxidized GSH (GSSG;

Cell survival after exposure to Dp44mT and its Cu and

The studies above indicate that Dp44mT enters cells and
forms a redox-active Cu complex that damages lysosomes.
Considering this, we examined the cytotoxicity of Dp44mT
and its Cu and Fe complexes. As shown in Fig. 6A, after a
3-hour incubation, 5 mmol/L of Cu[Dp44mT] significantly
(P < 0.001) decreased viability to 28%  4% of the control.
In contrast, Dp44mT or Fe[Dp44mT]2 (both at 5 mmol/L) did

ing Dp44mT concentrations, Dp44mT in the presence of the
Cu chelator, TM, or the preformed TM–Cu complex, which
blocks the ability of TM to bind cellular Cu (Fig. 6B). The
addition of TM to Dp44mT markedly prevented the ability of
the latter to reduce cellular viability up to a Dp44mT concentration of 2.5 mmol/L, whereas the preformed Cu-TM
complex (which cannot bind cellular Cu) had no significant
rescue effect on Dp44mT cytotoxicity (Fig. 6B).
To confirm that the ability of TM to rescue Dp44mT
cytotoxicity was due to Cu chelation, we used the structurally
unrelated Cu chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), in
identical studies and observed a similar, but less pronounced,
rescue effect on Dp44mT cytotoxicity (Fig. 6B). Like TM, BCS
decreased Dp44mT cytotoxicity, whereas its Cu complex
(BCS-Cu) had no significant influence (Fig. 6B), as its binding
site was saturated with Cu. Notably, BCS or TM alone or their
Cu complexes had no significant effect on viability (Supplementary Fig. S3).
As Dp44mT concentration increased, the ability of the Cu
chelators BCS or TM to prevent cytotoxicity was markedly
reduced after 72 hours (Fig. 6B). This may reflect chelation of
Fe by Dp44mT which becomes significant at these higher concentrations and leads to Fe deprivation and cytotoxicity (6).
Indeed, while the binding of Cu by Dp44mT is crucial for its
antitumor efficacy, its Fe chelation efficacy is also important (6, 8).

Dp44mT Forms a Copper Complex That Targets Lysosomes

GSH levels modulate Cu[Dp44mT] cytotoxicity
Because GSH plays an important role in buffering redox
stress (22) and considering the marked redox activity of
Cu[Dp44mT], as shown in Fig. 5A–C, further studies examined
its effect on GSH (Fig. 6C–F). To investigate this, the effect
of GSH supplementation or depletion on viability was assessed
by incubating cells in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
that enhances GSH levels (22), or the GSH synthesis inhibitor,
BSO, that decreases GSH (22). Indeed, a 24-hour incubation of
SK-N-MC cells with NAC (5 mmol/L) or BSO (100 mmol/L)
significantly (P < 0.001) increased and decreased the GSH/
GSSG ratio to 155%  5% and 4%  2% (n ¼ 3) of the control,
respectively.
The addition of NAC (5 mmol/L) with Cu[Dp44mT] significantly (P < 0.001) prevented the decrease in viability due
to Cu[Dp44mT] after 3 and 24 hours (Fig. 6C), and similar
results were observed as a function of concentration over
72 hours (Fig. 6D). Supplementation with NAC also significantly (P < 0.01) protected against the decreased viability
observed with Fe[Dp44mT]2 or Dp44mT alone after 72 hours
(Fig. 6C and D), and thus decreased their cytotoxicity. Further, morphologic studies using acridine orange also showed
that NAC preserved lysosomal integrity in the presence of
Cu[Dp44mT], as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.
In contrast to NAC, the addition of BSO with Dp44mT and
Fe[Dp44mT]2 significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced their cytotoxicity particularly at 24 hours (Fig. 6E). However, the addition of BSO with 5 mmol/L of Cu[Dp44mT] did not increase its
cytotoxicity (Fig. 6E). This may be due to the marked redox
activity of Cu[Dp44mT] relative to Dp44mT and Fe[Dp44mT]2
at high concentrations (Fig. 5A), which rapidly depresses GSH
levels (Fig. 5D).
As a function of chelator or complex concentration (0.02–
0.25 mmol/L), BSO potentiated cytotoxicity of Dp44mT,
Fe[Dp44mT]2, and Cu[Dp44mT] after 72 hours (Fig. 6F).
Hence, at low Cu[Dp44mT] concentrations (i.e., 0.02–0.25
mmol/L; Fig. 6F), BSO clearly potentiated the cytotoxicity of
this complex after 72 hours, in contrast to higher Cu[Dp44mT]
concentrations (i.e., 5 mmol/L; Fig. 6E).

(Fig. 4A) and concomitant cleavage of Bid into its proapoptotic form (Fig. 4B). Indeed, cathepsins can cleave Bid, which
migrates to mitochondria and induces outer membrane permeabilization that is dependent on proapoptotic Bax (30). Bax
plays a role in inducing release of mitochondrial h-cytc,
thereby activating the caspase cascade (31), which we showed
occurs after Dp44mT treatment (6). Hence, LMP by redoxactive Cu[Dp44mT] could result in downstream effects on
mitochondria that lead to h-cytc release.
The Dp44mT-Cu complex showed far greater cytotoxicity as
a function of time than either the Fe complex or the ligand
alone. This was also reflected in the faster kinetics of lysosomal rupture (Fig. 3D), cathepsin D release (Fig. 4A), and
decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig. 5D) induced by
Cu[Dp44mT]. As these events all occur over the same time
scale, they suggest a coherent and coordinated series of events
that ultimately induces significant cytotoxicity. Intriguingly,
the importance of Cu in mediating the cytotoxicity of the free
ligand was shown by the rescue effect of the nontoxic Cu
chelators, TM and BCS. This indicated that formation of a
redox-active Cu[Dp44mT] complex is important for Dp44mT
activity. Moreover, it was shown that Cu[Dp44mT] results in a
marked decrease in GSH and the cytotoxicity of this complex
can be reduced by NAC, which enhances GSH levels (22).
Conversely, cytotoxicity can be potentiated by the GSH inhibitor, BSO. These results indicate that lysosomal damage
caused by Cu[Dp44mT] was directly due to its redox activity.
On the basis of these data, we propose a model of the
mechanism of action of Dp44mT (Fig. 7).
Another aspect of the mechanism of action of Dp44mT is
that it shows selectivity against tumor cells in vitro and in vivo
(7). The basis for this relates, in part, to the greater uptake and
metabolism of Cu and Fe for essential processes in cancer cells
relative to normal cells (5). Under such conditions, the lysosome could be more active in terms of its metal metabolism,
and hence, more susceptible to Dp44mT. It is also known that
lysosomal autophagic pathways in cancer cells are abnormal
due to the monoallelic deletion of the essential autophagy

Discussion
N

In this investigation, we showed that incubation of cells
with Dp44mT leads to retention of its 64Cu complex. The
probable reason for this is the ionization characteristics of
Dp44mT (8). At physiologic pH, Dp44mT is neutral and
permeates cell membranes (6, 8). However, in the lysosomal
compartment (pH 5; ref. 29), an increased proportion of
Dp44mT becomes positively charged leading to accumulation,
ROS formation, and LMP.
Dp44mT induces apoptosis using several cell types and a
tumor model in vivo (6). Moreover, we showed that apoptosis
occurred via the mitochondrial pathway, where decreased Bcl2 and increased Bax expression occurred along with holocytochrome c (h-cytc) release and caspase activation (6). Our
study suggests that these apoptotic events could be caused by
Cu[Dp44mT]-induced redox stress that results in LMP, causing redistribution of lysosomal cathepsins to the cytosol

regulator, beclin1 (32). As such, metal recycling due to autophagy could be disturbed and lead to differences between
neoplastic and normal cells in their response to agents such
as Dp44mT.
In summary, we have dissected the mechanism of action of
Dp44mT and showed that it accumulates in lysosomes due to
its unique ionization characteristics. Our investigation reveals
the marked redox activity of Cu[Dp44mT] leads to LMP that
induces cell death. Moreover, this study shows that targeting
lysosomes can lead to potent and selective anticancer therapeutics. Knowledge of this mechanism can be used to design
more potent cytotoxic agents that affect the lysosomal apoptosis pathway.
