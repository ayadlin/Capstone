Abstract

Author Manuscript

‘Gain’ of supernumerary copies of the 8q24.21 chromosomal region has been shown to be
common in many human cancers1–13 and is associated with poor prognosis7,10,14. The wellcharacterized myelocytomatosis (MYC) oncogene resides in the 8q24.21 region and is consistently
co-gained with an adjacent ‘gene desert’ of approximately 2 megabases that contains the long noncoding RNA gene PVT1, the CCDC26 gene candidate and the GSDMC gene. Whether low copynumber gain of one or more of these genes drives neoplasia is not known. Here we use
chromosome engineering in mice to show that a single extra copy of either the Myc gene or the
region encompassing Pvt1, Ccdc26 and Gsdmc fails to advance cancer measurably, whereas a
single supernumerary segment encompassing all four genes successfully promotes cancer. Gain of
PVT1 long non-coding RNA expression was required for high MYC protein levels in 8q24amplified human cancer cells. PVT1 RNA and MYC protein expression correlated in primary
human tumours, and copy number of PVT1 was co-increased in more than 98% of MYC-copyincrease cancers. Ablation of PVT1 from MYC-driven colon cancer line HCT116 diminished its

tumorigenic potency. As MYC protein has been refractory to small-molecule inhibition, the
dependence of high MYC protein levels on PVT1 long non-coding RNA provides a much needed
therapeutic target.

To determine whether low copy-number gain of MYC and/or other genetic element(s) in the
8q24.21 region (PVT1, CCDC26 and GSDMC; Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1) promotes
cancer, chromosome engineering15 (Extended Data Fig. 2) was used to derive mice bearing
single-copy gain of (1) Myc alone (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a), (2) Pvt1, Ccdc26 and
Gsdmc (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2b) and (3) the entire 2-Mb
Myc,Pvt1,Ccdc26,Gsdmc syntenic region (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2c). All three
strains were viable and fertile and showed no overt developmental defect. In human breast
and ovarian cancers, gain of 8q24 is often accompanied by ERBB2 amplification16,17.
Accordingly, each mutant line was bred to MMTVneu transgenic mice18 and mammary
tumour latency was examined. gain(Myc), MMTVneu mice developed mammary tumours at
essentially the same median latency (345 days) as MMTVneu mice (Fig. 1e), indicating that
a single supernumerary Myc gene is insufficient to promote MMTVneu-driven cancer.
Tumour latency of gain(Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc), MMTVneu mice was also indistinguishable
from MMTVneu mice (316 days; Fig. 1e). In contrast, gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc),
MMTVneu mice showed shorter mammary tumour latency (224 days; Fig. 1e) and increased
penetrance (90%) compared with the other three genotypes (40–60%). Compared with agematched MMTVneu adenomas, gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc), MMTVneu tumours
presented a high mitotic index involving locally invasive solid masses that invaded adjacent
thin-walled blood vessels, consistent with adenocarcinomas (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c).
Three out of ten gain(Myc, Pvt1, Cdc26, Gsdmc) mice, but none of gain(Myc), gain(Pvt1,
Cdc26, Gsdmc) and wild-type mice (n = 10 for each genotype), developed metastasis in the
absence of MMTVneu in a limited-lifespan study (500 days), indicating that gain(Myc, Pvt1,
Cdc26, Gsdmc) contributes to spontaneous metastasis in older mice, albeit with low
penetrance (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). These data demonstrate that gain of a single copy of
Myc cooperates with one or more genetic element(s) in the Pvt1/Ccdc26/Gsdmc region to
promote mammary tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

The mammary epithelium of 10-week-old gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) mice showed
pre-cancerous properties in the absence of MMTVneu, including elevated levels of γ-H2AX
(a marker of DNA damage; Fig. 2a), p53 (a key mediator of cellular stress response) and
phospho-ERK1/2 (a pro-survival signaling molecule; Extended Data Fig. 4a, b).
Accordingly, gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) mammary epithelium showed increased
DNA replication (Fig. 2b), reduced oestrogen receptor-α expression19 (Extended Data Fig.
4c) and 5.5 times more lateral ductal branching than wild type (Fig. 2c). gain(Myc) glands
showed a more modest twofold increase in branching compared with wild type.
Furthermore, gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) mice showed aberrant differentiation,
including a precocious alveolar-like phenotype and co-expression of keratin-14 (a
myoepithelial marker) with keratin-8, in luminal epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 4d, e).
Crossing gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) mice with mice carrying a deletion of precisely
the same region resulted in mice with two copies of this region on one chromosome 15
homologue and no copy on the other, which completely abolished aberrant cellular

proliferation (Fig. 2d) and excessive branching (Fig. 2e). Three copies of the Myc/Pvt1/
Ccdc26/Gsdmc region, therefore, produced pre-cancerous phenotypes.

We next sought to identify genetic elements driving gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc)
neoplasia. Ccdc26 transcript has not been detected in mouse, and Gsdmc expression was low
in mouse mammary tissue with no differences in Gsdmc2–4 transcript levels across
genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 5). Consequently, we focused on Myc and Pvt1. Cells from
two independent gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc), MMTVneu mammary tumours were
transfected with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knockdown Myc (siMyc), Pvt1 (siPvt1)
or both, and grown in three-dimensional culture. siMyc had no effect on Pvt1 RNA levels,
and siPvt1 had no effect on Myc messenger RNA (mRNA) (Fig. 3a). Depletion of either
Myc or Pvt1 RNA resulted in approximately 60% reduction in proliferation as measured by
Ki67 staining (Fig. 3b). Surprisingly, simultaneous knockdown of both Myc and Pvt1 failed
to reduce proliferation below individual knockdown of either gene (Fig. 3b), suggesting that
Myc and Pvt1 promote proliferation through the same pathway.

Author Manuscript

Analysis of Myc and Pvt1 expression showed that both gain(Myc) and gain(Myc, Pvt1,
Ccdc26, Gsdmc) mammary glands showed approximately 3.5-fold more Myc mRNA than
wild type or gain(Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) (Fig. 3c). Pvt1 mRNA levels were approximately
1.5 times higher in gain(Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) than wild type, as expected, but were
surprisingly tenfold elevated in gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) and fourfold increased in
gain(Myc) mammary glands (Fig. 3c). Because MYC protein is a transcriptional activator of
PVT1 (refs 20, 21), this result suggested higher levels of Myc protein and/or activity in
gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc). Threefold higher Myc protein levels were observed in
gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc) mammary gland compared with the other three strains
(Fig. 3d). Thus, a third copy of Myc + Pvt1 increased Pvt1 transcription and Myc protein in
mice.
To extend these findings to high-8q24.21 copy cancers, we examined human breast-cancer
cell lines SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231, which harbour high copy gains3. siMYC and
siPVT1 had no effect on PVT1 and MYC RNA, respectively (Fig. 3e), but reduced
proliferation to similar extents with combined siMYC + siPVT1 failing to reduce
proliferation further (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Furthermore, siPVT1 led to suppression of
MYC protein levels (Fig. 3f), verifying that MYC protein levels are dependent upon PVT1
mRNA in high-copy 8q24-gain cancer cells. Knockdown of individual microRNAs
(miRNAs) encoded in the human PVT1 introns had no detectable effect on proliferation
(Extended Data Fig. 6c, d).

The half-life of MYC protein is increased in SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells compared
with non-transformed breast epithelial cells22. To determine whether MYC protein stability
is PVT1-RNA dependent, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with siPVT1
or control siRNA and exposed to cycloheximide. PVT1 depletion resulted in more rapid loss
of MYC protein than control cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 7). MYC protein
degradation is promoted by phosphorylation at threonine 58 (ref. 23), and mice expressing
MycT58A show enhanced mammary gland density, and mammary carcinoma24. Although
siPVT1-mediated reduction of MYC protein levels was not accompanied by changes in

levels of FBW7 and AXIN1, which are key downstream components of MYC degradation,
T58 phosphorylation was increased fivefold (Fig. 3h). Thus, MYC is protected from
phosphorylation at the T58 residue and subsequent degradation in a PVT1-RNA-dependent
manner, raising the possibility of a MYC/PVT1 ribonucleoprotein complex. Simultaneous
RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect PVT1 and immunofluorescence for
MYC showed nuclear co-localization in 85.1% of SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 3i and Extended Data
Fig.8). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation using anti-MYC followed by PCR with reverse
transcription (RT–PCR) identified PVT1 RNA in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3j),
suggesting that PVT1 and MYC physically interact directly or indirectly. Whether specific
PVT1 isoform(s), CCDC26 and GSDMC promote malignancy remains to be investigated.
Together, these results indicate that gain of the Myc/MYC gene alone fails to increase MYC
protein levels but that co-gain of the Pvt1/PVT1 gene disrupts Myc/MYC instability,
resulting in increased protein levels and enhanced proliferation.

If PVT1 copy increase is critical for high MYC protein levels, then co-gain of PVT1 should
be mandatory in MYC-driven cancer. Analysis of 30,681 tumours from the Progenetix copynumber database showed that 18.8% (5,836 tumours) showed increased 8q24 copy number
and 5,763 out of 5,836 of these tumours (98.7%) had increased copy number of both MYC
and PVT1 genes. Similarly, analysis of 15,241 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) database showed that 18.02% (2,821 tumours) showed 8q24 copy-number increase
and that 2,746 out of 2,821 tumours (97.34%) showed co-gain of both MYC and PVT1
whereas fewer than 0.15% of tumours showed increased copy number of MYC but not PVT1
(Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Sorting TCGA tumours by cancer type showed
differences in the incidence of 8q24 copy-number increase in individual cancer types
ranging from MYC + PVT1 increase in almost half of ovarian and oesophageal carcinomas
to essentially no MYC and/or PVT1 increase among papillary thyroid tumours (Fig. 4b).
Gain of MYC and PVT1 was observed in 62% of 483 HER2+ breast cancer samples
(Extended Data Fig. 9b). Unlike mouse, GSDMC orthologues are expressed in human
mammary tissue (http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene5GSDMC). Although
gain of MYC + PVT1 + CCDC26 + GSDMC prevailed in low copy-number gain of 8q24
segments, co-gain of MYC + PVT1 (but not CCDC26 or GSDMC) prevailed in high copy
amplifications (Extended Data Fig. 9c, d). Co-gain of MYC and PVT1, therefore, dominated
over gain of MYC alone across all cancer types showing 8q24 copy-number increases.

To verify these findings, we examined tissue microarrays for PVT1 RNA using in situ
hybridization and MYC protein using immunohistochemistry on serial sections of human
lung, colon, rectum, stomach, oesophagus, liver, kidney and breast tumours. Concurrent
PVT1 RNA and MYC protein expressions were found in all eight cancers (Fig. 4c and
Extended Data Fig. 9e, f), confirming that PVT1 RNA and the MYC protein are correlated
in primary tumours.
Finally, effects of PVT1 loss on MYC-driven tumours were assessed using HCT116 human
colorectal carcinoma cells, which harbour low copy-number 8q24 gain and stable mutant βcatenin leading to MYC overexpression (Fig. 4d)25. CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas9) was
used to excise precisely all copies of the PVT1 gene (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 10a, b)
generating PVT1-null (ΔPVT1) HCT116 cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 10c). ΔPVT1 lines

demonstrated reduced proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 10d) and impaired colony formation
in soft agar compared with PVT1 + HCT116 cells (232.2 ± 23.8 versus 2,022.3 ± 140.7
colonies; Fig. 4f). In xenograft studies, ΔPVT1 HCT116 cells either failed to formtumours
(three out of six xenografts; Fig.4g) or showed markedly reduced volume (three out of six
xenografts; Extended Data Fig. 10e) compared with PVT1+ counterparts (Fig. 4g). Finally,
MYC protein was significantly reduced (49.1% ± 3.4) in ΔPVT1 HCT116 clones compared
with PVT11 HCT116 cells (Fig. 4h). PVT1 therefore regulates MYC protein level, and
bestows tumorigenic potential to an MYC-driven non-breast cancer line.

Author Manuscript

Targeting MYC directly with therapeutic interventions has proved challenging26–28; thus
regulation of high MYC protein levels by the PVT1 long non-coding (lncRNA) bears
considerable implications for therapeutic treatment of MYC-driven cancers. Because MYC
is an important transcription factor and an essential protein27, direct inhibition may have
severe effects on patients. Our findings indicate that PVT1 lncRNA increases MYC protein
levels in 8q24-gain cancers and that loss of PVT1 RNA reduces MYC protein to more
normal levels. PVT1, therefore, may be a more accessible and less deleterious target than
MYC itself for curtailing MYC-driven cancers (Fig. 4i). Future studies on the role of PVT1
on the MYC protein level in cancers without supernumerary 8q24 and illuminating the
molecular details of MYC/PVT1 cooperation may lead to rational drug discovery
specifically targeting the MYC/PVT1 axis in human cancers.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Chromosome engineering on mouse AB2.2 embryonic stem cells was as previously
described29 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Mouse mammary glands were analysed as described30.
Tissue microarray slides of human multiple-organ tumours (BC00119) were obtained from
US Biomax. For copy-number analysis of TCGA tumours, data were derived from the
Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform from the open-access directory
of TCGA (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/
tumor/). CRISPR-mediated ΔPVT1 HCT116 cells were generated using piggyBac cotransposition enrichment.

METHODS
Mouse strains and tumour analysis

Author Manuscript

Correctly targeted df/dp embryonic stem clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to
establish chimaeric mice. The F1 dp/+ progeny generated from chimaera crossed with
C57BL/6J were genotyped by PCR and backcrossed three times to FVB/N mice. For tumour
analysis, dp/+ mouse strains were crossed with FVB/N-Tg (MMTVneu) 202Mul/J transgenic
mice (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory) to generate the control (hemizygous
MMTVneu) and experimental (gain, hemizygous MMTVneu) animals. After 4 months, these
mice were monitored weekly by palpation for tumour induction. Tumours were documented
in a double-blinded manner. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of University of Minnesota and were conducted in accordance
with the procedures in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (IACUC code
number 1206A16225). We calculated our sample size for a power of 0.80 of a significance

level of 0.05 for pre-specific effect size. The occurrence of spontaneously developing
mammary tumour in a group of MMTVneu transgenic mice was 70% (pc = 0.7) and we
wished to test whether a group of gain(Myc, Pvt1, Ccdc26, Gsdmc), MMTVneu mice could
reduce the tumour latency by at least 20% (pe = 0.20), with a power of 80% and a
significance level of 5%. Then d = 0.5 and C = 7.85 (formula: n = [C(pc × qc + pe × qe)/d2 +
2/d + 2], where qc = 1 − pc, qe = 1 − pe and d = |pc − pe|β). All animals were included. Each
animal was assigned to its cohort as determined by its genotype. The animals were housed
randomly and monitored for tumour induction in a double-blinded fashion. The tumour
latency study was done in a double-blinded fashion, where the animals were assigned
numbers instead of their genotypes. After the tumour study, the numbers were replaced with
their respective genotypes.
Mammary gland isolation, wholemounts and measurement of mammary ductal branching

Author Manuscript

Ten-week-old virgin mice were killed for dissecting mammary glands. Mammary glands
from at least three mice per genotype were analysed. For the mammary ductal branching
studies, inguinal (No. 4) mammary glands were spread out, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Merck) for 2 h, then stained.Images were acquired using Leica Application Suite software
on a Leica dissecting microscope and analysed using Adobe Photoshop and ImageJ
software. The number of ductal branch points was measured from the 25-mm2 area near the
lymph node of the mammary gland. All experimental mice and control mice were littermates
with matching oestrous cycles.
Histological analysis and tissue immunofluorescence staining

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We analysed paraffin sections of paraformaldehyde-fix (4%) mammary glands and tumours
stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescence analyses, 5-μm sections were
de-paraffinized and rehydrated, and antigens were retrieved using the Antigen Unmasking
Solution (Vector Laboratories). Section samples were washed with PBS and blocked using
M.O.M. Basic Kit (Vector Laboratories) or 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. Primary
antibodies were incubated for overnight at 4 °C. For proliferation assays, mice were injected
with 100 mg kg−1 BrdU drug (Sigma) 2 h before being killed, tissues were stained with antiBrdU (Abcam, ab1893) at 1:300 dilution as described previously31 and sections were
counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Other primary antibodies were diluted with M.O.M.
diluent using the following conditions: cytokeratin 8 (1:100, Epitomics, 2032-1), cytokeratin
14 (1:150, Covance, PRB-155P), oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (1:50, Santa Cluz
Biotechnology, sc-542) and γ-H2AX (1:100, Cell Signaling, 2577). Each staining was
performed in mammary gland sections dissected from at least three mice of experimental
groups and the control group. Fluorescent images were acquired using fluorescence
microscopy (Carl Zeiss Axio Obersever.Z1).
Cell culture and reagents
Primary mouse tumour cells or primary mouse mammary epithelial cells were dissociated
from mammary tumours or mammary glands by incubation with collagenase type I
(Invitrogen) for 3 h and then plated on fetuin (Sigma) in growth media (DMEM/F12
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 5 μg ml−1 insulin (Sigma), 1 μg ml−1

(Invitrogen)) as described previously30. After 3 days, mammary epithelial cells and tumour
cells were collected and stored at −80 °C for further experiments. Only early passages of
tumour cells were used for advanced assays. Human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and
MDA-MB-231 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. SK-BR-3 was
short tandem repeat profiled (https://www.atcc.org/Products/All/
HTB-30.aspx#A7931A04156C4C7FA40828AEF707302F) and Mycoplasma tested. MDAMB-231 was also short tandem repeat profiled and Mycoplasma tested (https://
www.atcc.org/Products/All/HTB-26.aspx#A7931A04156C4C7FA40828AEF707302F) SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in McCoys5A (Lonza) containing 10% FBS
and DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS respectively. Human colorectal cancer cell
line HCT116 was a gift from D. Largaespada. These cells were cultured in ATCCformulated McCoy’s 5a Medium Modified (catalogue number 30–2007) supplemented with
10% FBS.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and RT–qPCR analysis

Author Manuscript

Mouse mammary glands were removed at 6 and 10 weeks of age and immediately stored in
the liquid nitrogen. Frozen mammary tissue lysates were prepared in Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen) by using the SHREDDER SG3 system (Pressure BioSciences) as described by
the manufacturer. Cell lysates were collected from six-well plates. RNA was isolated from
the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), including a DNase digestion step (Qiagen), as described by
the manufacturer. Total RNA was quantified by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). RNA quality
was estimated by running RNA on agarose gels. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was
synthesized from equal amounts of total RNA and followed the manufacturer’s protocol
using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with Random Hexamer primers. For
qPCR, the 50 ng of cDNA was added in reactions performed on an ep realplex S machine
(Eppendorf) using SYBR Green Master Mix (Promega) and gene-specific primers
(Supplementary Table 4). Primers for all amplification were designed the location on exon–
exon borders by using Primer3 software. We used melting curve analysis to confirm the
specificity of primers. Amplifications were done as technical duplicates and biological
triplicates in 96-well plates.
Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Mouse mammary tissues were collected as above and protein extracted by using the
SHREDDER SG3 system (Pressure BioSciences) in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH
7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton-X-100; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1%
SDS) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were
also prepared in RIPA buffer at the indicated time points. Lysates were centrifuged at
18,620g at 4 °C for 30 min, supernatants were collected, and protein was quantified with a
Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were loaded and analysed by SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was done using the following: c-Myc
(Abcam, ab32), T58 (Abcam, ab85380), S62 (Abcam, ab51156), FBW7 (Novus Biologicals
NBP1-59631), AXIN1 (Cell Signaling, 2087), GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 5174), pERK1/2

siRNAtransfections and three-dimensional culture

Author Manuscript

siRNA against human PVT1 and MYC as well as mouse Pvt1 and Myc were designed and
purchased from FlexiTube siRNA (Qiagen). Two siRNAs located different parts of the
PVT1/Pvt1 mRNA sequence (Hs_PVT1_5 FlexiTube siRNA and Hs_PVT1_6 FlexiTube
siRNA; Mm_Pvt1_1 FlexiTube siRNA and Mm_Pvt1_4 FlexiTube siRNA) and two
siRNAs located different parts of the MYC/Myc mRNA sequence (Hs_MYC_5 FlexiTube
siRNA and Hs_MYC_7 FlexiTube siRNA; Mm_Myc_1 FlexiTube siRNA and Mm_Myc_4
FlexiTube siRNA) were used in this study. A predesigned siRNA (All Stars Negative
Control siRNA, Qiagen) was used for the negative control and conjugated with Alexa Fluor
488 to confirm the transfection efficiency. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were plated to each
well of a six-well plate 24 h before the transfection procedure; the cell confluency of each
well was 50%. siRNA transfection was applied with DharmaFECT 4 (Thermo Scientific)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were collected for RNA isolation 48 h after
transfection and for protein extraction 72 h after transfection. siRNA (5 μM) was tranfected
into cells. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. For the Ki67 proliferation
assay, cells were trypsinized from the well of a six-well plate 24 h after transfection, and 1 ×
104 cells were re-plated in the three-dimensional on-top culture system to grow for 72 h. For
the three-dimensional culture procedure, a total 1 × 104 cells were plated on growth-factor
reduced matrigel (BD Bioscience) in the eight-well chamber slide as described previously32.
Mouse mammary epithelial cells were maintained in growth media with 2% matrigel for
observing the morphology and measuring the size of acinus-like structures.
Ki67 proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

We performed cell proliferation assays in breast cancer cell lines as previously described33.
In brief, cells were directly fixed in eight-well chamber slides with 4% paraformaldehyde
after siRNA treatments for 96 h. Cells were blocked and stained with Ki67 antibody (1:500,
Vector Laboratories) and then counterstained with DAPI for the total number of cells as
described previously32. Ki67 index was assessed by counting the proportion of Ki67positive cells. The number of Ki67-positive cells was scored by eye and divided by the total
number of cells. The number of total nuclei counted per well was above 500 for each
experimental assay.
Double fluorescent detection of MYC protein and PVT1 mRNA in SK-BR-3 cells

SK-BR-3 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS and then
dehydrated. After rehydration, in situ hybridization was performed with fluorescein-labelled
PVT1 probe (cDNA clone IMAGE:5517530, Open Bio-systems) according to a standard
procedure34, followed by goat anti-MYC antibody (AF3696, 10 μg ml−1, R&D Systems)
reaction at 4 °C overnight. The samples were treated with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-Fluorescein/
Oregon Green (Invitrogen; A11091, 1:100) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen;
A11055, 1:1,000), and counterstained with DAPI. Fluorescent signals were detected using a
Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) and analysed by
ZEN2009 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). Because the sense PVT1 probe detected some
nuclear signal, albeit much weaker than the antisense probe, it is possible that the observed
PVT1 FISH staining could have contained some non-specific nuclear staining.

Tissue microarray analysis

Author Manuscript

Human multiple organ tumour tissue microarray slides (BC00119) were obtained from US
Biomax. In situ hybridization used digoxigenin-labelled PVT134 probe according to a
standard procedure34 and counterstaining with nuclear fast red. MYC
immunohistochemistry was done using anti-MYC antibodies HRP-conjugated rabbit antigoat IgG (Bio-Rad, 172-1034, 1:500), and visualized by a peroxidase substrate kit (Vector
Laboratories, SK-4105).
RNA-immunoprecipitation analysis

Author Manuscript

RNA-immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-MYC or preimmune IgG (negative control)
antibody was performed as described before35 using Immunoprecipitation Kit Dynabeads
Protein G (Invitrogen). Twenty million SK-BR-3 cells were used to generate 2–5 mg of total
protein per RNA-immunoprecipitation.
MYC and PVT1 gain across human cancers

Author Manuscript

Copy-number gain of MYC, PVT1 or MYC 1 PVT1 in human tumours was assessed by
examining the copy-number data from the TCGA and Progenetix genomic copy-number
aberration databases. For TCGA, the copy-number variation results (level 3) derived from
Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform for 15,888 tumour samples were
downloaded from TCGA’s open-access HTTP directory (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/tumor/). For Progenetix, the chromosomal
regions with copy-number aberration derived from chromosomal comparative genomic
hybridization and array comparative genomic hybridization for 30,681 tumour samples were
downloaded from the Progeneix website (http://www.progenetix.org/). For each sample, we
cross-compared the loci of three MYC exons (chromosome 8: 128748314–128748868,
chromosome 8: 128750493–128751264 and chromosome 8: 128752641–128753679) and
eight PVT1 exons (chromosome 8: 128902873–128903243, chromosome 8: 128951753–
128951921, chromosome 8: 128996149–128996449, chromosome 8: 129001407–
129001536, chromosome 8: 129082405–129082517, chromosome 8: 129108763–
129108899, chromosome 8: 129111615–129111818 and chromosome 8: 129113225–
129113498), with chromosomal regions having copy gains. For TCGA, segmentation mean
value was greater than 0.22; and for chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization and
array comparative genomic hybridization data from Progenetix, the regions with segvalue 1
were considered as copy gains. Overlapped exon(s) were recorded.
Co-gain of MYC + PVT1 + CCDC26 + GSDMC in low versus high copy-number gain of 8q24

Author Manuscript

We investigated the relationship between ratio of MYC + PVT1 + CCDC26 or MYC + PVT1
+ GSDMC co-amplification on MYC + PVT1 co-amplification at different amplification
levels on TCGA data. The level 3 copy-number variation data from TCGA provided a logratio-based mean copy-number estimate of segments covering genomic regions (inferred
from the Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform). We used segment
mean 0.32 (2.5 copies) as a cutoff for copy gains. The Progenetix database did not provide
such a distinction between amplification levels.

Generating ΔPVT1 HCT116 cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The human-codon-optimized Cas9 cDNA and chimaeric guide RNA (gRNA) were acquired
from Addgene (41815 and 41824). Cas9 was PCR amplified and cloned into pENTR221
using SnaBI and XbaI sites engineered into the PCR primers. pENTR221 was then
transferred to pT3.5-CAG-DEST by standard LR Clonase (Invitrogen) reaction, following
the manufacturer’s instructions. The chimaeric gRNA was PCR amplified and cloned into
pENTR221 using SnaBI and XbaI. gRNAs targeting the 5′ and 3′ ends of PVT1 were
designed using Zfit software (http://zifit.partners.org/ZiFiT/). gRNAs targeting PVT1 were
generated using inverse PCR of pENTR221-gRNA using the common reverse primer 5′CGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCAC-3′, and target specific forward primer for the 5′ end (5′CATCACCGGGGATTCCCTCGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATA GC-3′) and 3′ end (5′GCCTGGAGGCCAGCTCAAAGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGC-3′) of PVT1 using
Accuprime Pfx Supermix (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified
PCR products were then treated with polynucleotide kinase and T4 Ligase (New England
Biolabs), following the manufacturer’s instructions. New gRNAs were sequence verified by
standard Sanger sequencing.

Author Manuscript

CRISPR-mediated ΔPVT1 HCT116 cells were then generated using piggyBac cotransposition enrichment as described36. Briefly, cells were NEON electroporated with 2 μg
each of hCas9 and the 5′ and 3′ PVT1 gRNA in addition to the 500 ng each of PB7
transposase and PB-CAG-Luc (puro) transposon vector. CRISPR treated cells were then
incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Cells were then seeded at varying densities (100–1000 cells
per well) in 96-well plates with Puromycin containing DMEM media. Wells that produced
single colonies were expanded and DNA extracted. Clones were then genotyped for deletion
of PVT1 using standard PCR genotyping (primer sequences are provided). Identified wildtype clones were used as controls.
Proliferation, soft agar and xenograft assay for PVT1+ and ΔPVT1 HCT116 cells
The proliferation assay used CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(MTS) (Promega G3580) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two thousand cells
were seeded per well. Three independent clones for each genotype were used for the study
in triplicate (n = 3).

Author Manuscript

Soft agar and xenograft assays for PVT1+ and ΔPVT1 HCT116 cells were performed using
established protocol37. For the soft-agar anchorage-independent colony-formation assay,
experiments were performed intriplicate. Three independent clones from each genotype
were used. Three thousand cells per plate were seeded in soft agar. Colonies were allowed to
grow for 2 weeks and then fixed in 10% formalin containing 0.005% crystal violet for 1 h at
25 °C. After removing formalin, colonies were imaged on a Leica S8 AP0 microscope.
Twelve images for each plate were taken and the colonies counted by using ImageJ
software.
For xenograft assay, 2 × 106 ΔPVT1 HCT116 and approximately equal numbers of PVT1 +
HCT116 were injected subcutaneously on the left and the right flank of a nude mouse
respectively. Six nude mice were used for the study. Tumour growth was monitored on the

100 μl of 28.5 mg ml−1 luciferin by intraperitoneal injection. The tumour volumes were
measured by using electronic calliper (length × width × height).
Eliminating bias by blinded analysis
All analyses were in a double-blinded fashion.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

For tumour-free survival curves, statistical analyses used Prism 4 (GraphPad Software), and
P values were calculated by the log-rank test. All other P values were calculated using
Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed, P<0.05 was considered significant). Results are
reported as mean ± s.e.m. or mean ± s.d. The biological replicates for each experiment are
represented in the figure legends. All technical replicates were performed three times.
