Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Integration of cellular signaling pathways with androgen receptor (AR) signaling can be achieved
through phosphorylation of AR by cellular kinases. However, the kinases responsible for
phosphorylating the androgen receptor at numerous sites and the functional consequences of AR
phosphorylation are only partially understood. Bioinformatic analysis revealed AR serine 213
(S213) as a putative substrate for PIM1, a kinase overexpressed in prostate cancer. Therefore,
phosphorylation of AR serine 213 by PIM1 was examined using a phosphorylation site-specific
antibody. Wild type PIM1, but not catalytically inactive PIM1, specifically phosphorylated AR but
not an AR serine to alanine mutant (S213A). In vitro kinase assays confirmed that PIM1 can
phosphorylate AR S213 in a ligand independent manner and cell type specific phosphorylation
was observed in prostate cancer cell lines. Upon PIM1 overexpression AR phosphorylation was
observed in the absence of hormone and was further increased in the presence of hormone in
LNCaP, LNCaP-abl, and VCaP cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AR was reduced in the
presence of PIM kinase inhibitors. An examination of AR mediated transcription showed that
reporter gene activity was reduced in the presence of PIM1 and wild type AR, but not S213A
mutant AR. Androgen mediated transcription of endogenous PSA, Nkx3.1, and IGFBP5 was also
decreased in the presence of PIM1 whereas IL6, cyclin A1, and caveolin 2 were increased.
Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue microarrays showed significant P-AR
S213 expression that was associated with hormone refractory prostate cancers, likely identifying

cells with catalytically active PIM1. In addition, prostate cancers expressing a high level of P-AR
S213 were twice as likely to be from biochemically recurrent cancers. Thus, AR phosphorylation
by PIM1 at S213 impacts gene transcription and is highly prevalent in aggressive prostate cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The androgen receptor (AR), a phospho-protein (1), must respond to carefully timed
developmental and extracellular signals to direct differentiation and proliferation of the
prostate but the impact of AR phosphorylation on AR function and cancer progression is not
well understood. Studies using pharmacological inhibitors and kinase overexpression have
shown that Akt can phosphorylate the AR on serines 213 and 791 depending on cell type (2–
4). Moreover, our previous studies show that AR is rapidly phosphorylated at S213 in
response to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the synthetic androgen, R1881 and is tightly
regulated in prostate epithelial cells and tissues (5). While AR S213 is embedded in a
putative Akt consensus site, recent bioinformatic analysis (http://www.netphorest.info)
indicates that it is also a consensus site for PIM1 kinase. Using the phosphorylation sitespecific antibody against AR phospho-serine 213 (P-AR S213) developed in our laboratory,
we examined whether PIM1 could phosphorylate AR S213.

PIM1 is expressed as two isoforms, a longer form (44 kDa) resulting from an alternative
translation initiation site (6) and localized to the plasma membrane and a shorter form (33
kDa) that is localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleus (7–8). PIM1 promotes cell cycle
progression and cell survival by phosphorylation of Cdc25A (9), downregulation of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27 (10) and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic pathway by
phosphorylating BAD protein on the regulatory serine 112 site (11).
While PIM1 has been more extensively studied in lymphoma, there is increasing evidence to
suggest that PIM1 overexpression plays a role in prostate cancer (12–13). Consistent with
the synergy between c-myc and PIM1 in promoting leukemia (14–15), a mouse model of cmyc-driven prostate cancer shows that PIM1 is upregulated (16) and in a tissue
recombination model, PIM1 synergizes with c-myc to induce carcinoma (17). In addition, a
metastatic mouse model of prostate specific p53 and Rb deficiencies demonstrate increased
levels of PIM1 protein (18).

Author Manuscript

Several substrates of PIM1 have been identified: Cdc25A, p27, BAD, HP1γ, 4EBP1, and
p21, (9–11, 19–21). Here we identify AR as a novel PIM1 substrate. In the context of
prostate cancer, the proto-oncogene (22) PIM1 can phosphorylate AR S213 in a ligand
independent manner. Moreover, AR S213 phosphorylation is prevalent in recurring prostate
cancers, suggesting possible upregulation of a phosphorylating kinase and the marking of
cells with functionally active PIM1 in castration resistant prostate cancer.

Results
PIM1 Phosphorylates the Androgen Receptor at Serine 213
PIM1 and Akt kinases were assessed for their impact on AR phosphorylation at serine 213.
PIM1 (isoform 2, 33kDa) kinase was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293
cells with either wild type AR or an AR serine to alanine (S213A) mutant that cannot be
phosphorylated (Figure 1A). Figure 1A indicates that expression of PIM1 kinase results in
robust phosphorylation at AR S213 (lanes 2 and 8), without detectable phosphorylation of
the AR S213A mutant (lanes 5 and 11) indicating that PIM1 specifically phosphorylates
S213. While phosphorylation is more prevalent in the presence of ligand (10nM R1881, lane
8), there is also marked phosphorylation in the absence of exogenously added ligand (0nM
R1881, lane 2), suggesting that in the presence of PIM1 phosphorylation can occur under
low hormone conditions.

Since AR S213 may also be phosphorylated by Akt (2–4), we examined the impact of
constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) on AR S213 phosphorylation. The results indicate that
Akt also appears to increase AR S213 phosphorylation (Figure 1A). However, consistent
with previous results (23–24), the total AR protein levels are increased in the presence of
Akt, indicating that the apparent increase in phosphorylation is likely due to upregulation of
AR protein levels (compare AR panel, lane 7 versus 9 to P-AR S213 panel, lane 7 versus 9).
Upregulation of AR through Akt seems to be independent of AR phosphorylation since the
AR mutant S213A is also increased. However we cannot exclude the possibility that Akt
makes a contribution to AR phosphorylation under these conditions. To determine if the
catalytic activity of PIM1 kinase was necessary for AR S213 phosphorylation, a kinase
deficient PIM1 mutant (K67M) was co-expressed with AR and compared to PIM1 WT. As
shown in Figure 1B, co-expression of PIM1 K67M and AR did not increase P-AR S213
over the basal level of phosphorylation whereas the PIM1 WT increased phosphorylation of
AR S213.
Our previous work indicated that the ligand-dependent modification detected by the P-AR
S213 antibody, was phosphorylation (5) as demonstrated by the absence of antigen detection
following treatment with lambda phosphatase. The apparent increase in AR S213
phosphorylation in the presence of PIM1 was also sensitive to lambda phosphatase treatment
(Figure 2). Lambda phosphatase (λ PPase) treatment abolished AR S213 phosphorylation in
response to PIM1 in the absence of R1881 (Figure 2, lane 2 vs lane 4) and the presence of
R1881 (Figure 2, lane 6 vs 8), indicating that overexpression of PIM1 in fact, results in
phosphorylation on AR S213.

PIM1 Phosphorylates AR in vitro
Results shown above indicate that AR is phosphorylated at S213 in the presence of
overexpressed PIM1, but do not prove that PIM1 can directly phosphorylate AR. To
determine if AR is a PIM1 substrate we performed in vitro kinase assays. As a comparison,
the ability of Akt to phosphorylate AR S213 was also examined in these assays since Akt
has been reported to phosphorylate S213 (2–4). As shown in Figure 3A, P-AR S213 was
detected in the presence of GST-PIM1, but not His-tagged Akt (His-Akt) or GST-GSK3,

included as a negative control. In addition, AR S213 phosphorylation occurred in both the
presence and absence of ligand (compare 0nM R1881 to 10nM R1881). Interestingly, active
Akt was not able to phosphorylate AR under the conditions of these kinase reactions. To
ensure the His-tagged Akt was catalytically active, we incubated Akt with GST- GSK3 α/β,
a well-established substrate of Akt. As shown in Figure 3B, Akt was able to phosphorylate
GSK3 α/β at S21/9 and as expected, active PIM1 phosphorylated Bad at S112 (Figure 3C).
In addition, recombinant full length His-AR, was used in the in vitro kinase assay to
eliminate the possibility that phosphorylation was occurring because of proteins in complex
with immunoprecipitated AR. An in vitro kinase reaction containing 10nM R1881 was
performed using His-AR in the presence or absence of recombinant GST-PIM1.
Phosphorylation of AR S213 was only observed in the presence of PIM1 (Figure 3D), once
again indicating that AR is a substrate of PIM1 kinase.

PIM1 Expression in LNCaP and LNCaP-abl Cells Enhances AR Phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

Experiments shown above indicate that under conditions of AR and PIM1 overexpression,
AR becomes phosphorylated on S213. To determine if increased levels of PIM1 result in
phosphorylation of endogenous AR, PIM1 was overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines
including androgen dependent LNCaP and VCaP cells and an androgen independent LNCaP
subline, LNCaP-abl (abl). Overexpression of PIM1 resulted in phosphorylation of AR S213
that was readily detectable in LNCaP and abl cell lines compared to the vector only
conditions (Figure 4A). As in the 293 cell line experiments, phosphorylation occurred in
both the presence and absence of hormone. As expected, expression of the kinase deficient
mutant K67M did not result in P-AR S213 expression in LNCaP or abl cells (data not
shown). In VCaP cells P-AR S213 was observed in a hormone-sensitive manner in the
absence of PIM1 overexpression (see VCaP, vector only (v.o.) lanes, and compare minus
versus plus R1881). This is in contrast to LNCaP and LNCaP-abl cells where little
phosphorylation was observed in the absence of overexpressed PIM1. Moreover,
phosphorylated AR S213 significantly increased in the presence of overexpressed PIM1 in
VCaP cells. VCaP cells stably overexpressing vector only (v.o.) or PIM1 were generated to
assess the effect of PIM1 on cell proliferation (Figure 4B, right). PIM1 overexpression does
not appear to effect cell proliferation in adherent culture conditions but under anchorage
independent conditions using ultra-low attachment plates, VCaP cells overexpressing PIM1
formed more spheres than the vector control cell line (Figure 4B, left). The increased
number of spheres formed in the VCaP-PIM1 cell line suggests that these cells are more
transformed than the vector only cell line. A similar result has been reported for LNCaP
cells overexpressing PIM1 grown in soft agar (25).

Inhibition of AR S213 Phosphorylation in the Presence of PIM kinase Inhibitors
To determine if inhibition of PIM1 affected phosphorylation of AR S213, VCaP cells were
treated with 10nM R1881 in the presence of a PIM kinase inhibitor, SGI-1776. Treatment
with the inhibitor reduced phosphorylation of S213 and P-4EBP1 Thr37/46, an established
substrate of PIM1 (21, 26–27), in a dose dependent manner (Figure 5A). SGI-1176 also
significantly reduced the level of P-AR S213 in VCaP and LNCaP cells overexpressing
PIM1 (Figure 5B), indicating that PIM1 inhibition of both endogenous and upregulated

levels of PIM1 result in decreased expression of P-AR S213. In addition, a structurally
different PIM1 inhibitor, PIM1/2 inhibitor V, reduced endogenous phosphorylation of S213
in VCaP cells (Figure 5D). PIM1/2 inhibitor V was able to dramatically inhibit S213
phosphorylation in in vitro kinase reactions where immunopurified AR was incubated with
GST-PIM1 in the presence or absence of PIM 1/2 inhibitor V (Figure 5C). The robust
phosphorylation of AR by GST-PIM1 was reduced in the presence of inhibitor, independent
of the presence of hormone.
PIM1 Expression Affects AR Mediated Transcription

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The impact of PIM1 phosphorylation of AR S213 on AR function is not known. To evaluate
the effect of PIM1 phosphorylation of AR on gene transcription we conducted luciferase
assays using the AR reporter gene ARR3-luciferase (28) in the presence of either WT AR or
AR S213A. As shown in Figure 6A, co-expression of WT AR and PIM1 repressed AR
mediated transcription in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, PIM1 co-expression with
AR S213A had no effect on the same reporter gene (Figure 6B). The effect of PIM1
overexpression on AR WT and AR S213A transcriptional activity is not due to AR protein
levels, as AR levels are equivalent or increased slightly in the presence of PIM1 and 24
hours exposure to R1881 (Figure 6A and 6B, insets). In support of these studies,
examination of increased PIM1 expression in VCaP and LNCaP cells with endogenous
levels of AR showed diminished luciferase reporter gene activity in the presence of PIM1
(Figure 6C and D). In LNCaP cells stably expressing vector only or PIM1, we next
examined androgen mediated transcription of endogenous target genes PSA and Nkx3.1.
Androgen treatment increased mRNA transcript levels of PSA and Nkx3.1 in the vector only
cells as expected. However, in cells overexpressing PIM1, levels of PSA and Nkx3.1 mRNA
were reduced 1.9 to 3.7 fold (Figure 6E). Repression of androgen mediated transcription of
PSA and Nkx3.1 was not due to decreased levels of AR protein. Figure 6F shows that AR
protein levels were equivalent between vector only and PIM1 expressing cells and as
expected AR levels were increased in the presence of androgen. Thus, PIM1 appears to
decrease androgen mediated transcription of PSA and Nkx3.1, genes expressed by
differentiated prostate epithelial cells.

Author Manuscript

We also examined the impact of PIM1 expression on genes selected from the RT2 Profiler
PCR Array, representing 84 genes regulated in prostate cancer. Of the 84 genes, 13 were
upregulated greater than 2 fold and 7 were downregulated greater than 1.5 fold when
comparing PIM1 and vector only in the presence of R1881 (data not shown). IL6, cyclin A1
(CCNA1), caveolin 2 (CAV2), and IGFBP5 were highly up- or downregulated and were
chosen for validation based on androgen regulated expression, effect of PIM1 on
transcription, and relevance to prostate cancer. Androgen regulated expression of IGFBP5,
CCNA1, IL6, and CAV2 was observed (vo controls (Figure 7A)). In the presence of PIM1
and R1881, IL6, cyclin A1, and caveolin 2 were upregulated 5, 2.2, and 4 fold, respectively
while IGFBP5 was downregulated almost 7 fold (Figure 7A, compare black bars). In
addition, siRNA knockdown of PIM1 in VCaP cells resulted in increased PSA and IGFBP5
mRNA compared to non-silencing controls (Figure 7B, compare black bars). Reduced
protein expression of PIM1 in siRNA treated cells and equivalent AR levels are shown in
Figure 7C.

AR S213 and PIM1 Expression in Human Prostate Cancer

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate the possible clinical relevance of AR S213 phosphorylation, we examined the
expression pattern of antigen detected by antibody against P-AR S213 compared to antigen
detected by antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphoryated AR (total
AR). The studies were conducted on two different sets of tissue microarrays (TMAs)
obtained from the New York University (NYU) Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network and
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Disease outcome data was available
for both tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemistry was performed on both TMAs
examining the expression of P-ARS213 (Figure 8A, panels A–C) and AR (not shown). The
NYU TMA was also analyzed for PIM1 expression (Figure 8A, panels D–F). Histoscore (Hscore) analysis of the TMAs indicates that nuclear P-AR S213 expression was significantly
increased in hormone refractory cancers versus non-hormone refractory cancers (H-score of
64.28 ± 55.59 vs 13.41 ± 35.80, p<0.0001) (Figure 8B). In addition, expression of nuclear PAR S213 was increased in cases with high Gleason scores (Gleason 8–10) vs low Gleason
scores (Gleason 5–7) (H-score 43.07 ± 54.27 vs 0.90 ± 3.51, p<0.001) (Figure 8B).
Expression of nuclear P-AR S213 and PIM1 was much more prevalent in hormone
refractory cancer (Figure 8A, panels A–B and panels D–E) compared to non-hormone
refractory cancer (Figures 8A, panels C and F). PIM1 was expressed in 50% (32/64) of all
cases, of which 14 were hormone refractory. 88.9% (16/18) of hormone refractory cancers
were positive for P-AR S213 and 72.2% (12/18) of hormone refractory cases were positive
for P-AR S213 and PIM1.

Author Manuscript

In the MSKCC TMA, nuclear P-AR S213 expression was detected in a wide range of cases.
A far greater proportion of biochemically recurrent cancers have an H-score >100 (62.5%
recurrent vs 31.4% non-recurrent). If the H-score is dichotomized to 125, 40.6% of P-AR
S213 positive cases were recurrent vs 17.1% non-recurrent. While a high P-AR S213 Hscore was twice as likely to be from recurrent cancer, the H-scores of recurrent vs nonrecurrent cancer did not reach statistical significance. Overall, P-AR S213 expression did
not correlate to clinical parameters available with the MSKCC TMA, including PSA levels,
Gleason score, stage, recurrence, disease free interval or capsular penetration.

Author Manuscript

While the results from the microarrays have a similar trend, differences may be ascribed to
the tissue type represented on the TMAs. The NYU TMA consists of tissue from clinically
advanced prostate cancer obtained from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
Samples designated as hormone refractory were from patients that had failed hormone
ablation therapies. The MSKCC TMA consists of tissue from patients that have undergone
radical prostatectomy. Recurrent and non-recurrent cases were determined by biochemical
recurrence defined as three consecutive rises in PSA levels, as opposed to cancer
progression after hormone ablation.
Interestingly, a small number of cases had cytoplasmic staining in addition to nuclear
staining of P-AR S213 (21.5% NYU; 14.9% MSKCC). Positive P-AR S213 staining in the
cytoplasm was associated with a shorter disease-free interval (30 months vs 55 months). All
cases of cytoplasmic P-AR S213 in the NYU TMA were Gleason 9 and 10.

Discussion
The AR possesses consensus sequences for the kinases Akt (RXRXXS/T) and PIM1
(RXRHXS) that are highly similar, suggesting that either kinase may phosphorylate AR
depending on the cellular context. Our studies indicate that in prostate epithelial cells PIM1
robustly phosphorylates AR at S213 and AR is likely a direct substrate of PIM1. While
overexpression of Akt does result in slightly increased AR S213 phosphorylation in 293
cells (Figure 1) and VCaP cells (29), this more likely reflects the increase in AR protein
levels in the presence of Akt. However, it is possible that the kinase activity of the
myristoylated, constitutively active Akt construct used was not robust enough to elicit
phosphorylation of AR S213 and that more than one kinase can phosphorylate AR S213
depending on the cellular context.

Author Manuscript

Our studies indicate that AR is phosphorylated at S213 by endogenous PIM1 in VCaP cells.
This is in contrast to LNCaP cells, where very little phosphorylation is observed in the
absence of PIM1 overexpression. Since levels of PIM1 appear similar between all the cell
lines, this may reflect higher catalytic activity of PIM1 in VCaP cells than LNCaP cells.
Alternatively, it may simply be easier to detect S213 phosphorylation in VCaP cells since
AR levels are much higher than in LNCaP cells (Figure 4A).

We observe that overexpression of PIM1 results in decreased expression of an androgenresponsive reporter gene; consistent with a previous study that showed repression of a
probasin-luciferase reporter gene (30). However, PIM1 expression appears to have differing
affects on endogenous AR target gene transcription increasing proliferative and decreasing
differentiation signals. PIM1 overexpressing cells exhibit decreased androgen mediated
transcription of PSA, Nkx3.1, and IGFBP5 compared to vector only containing cells.
Repression or loss of the tumor suppressor, Nkx3.1, has been reported as an early event in
PTEN models of prostate cancer and correlates with cancer progression (31–32). Nkx3.1
and PSA are also markers of differentiated prostate epithelium (reviewed in (33)) suggesting
that PIM1 overexpression may cause de-differentiation of prostate tissue. IGFBP5 has also
been shown to be downregulated in metastases (34–35). In addition to repressing some AR
target genes, we also show that PIM1 is involved in activation of AR target genes important
in cell proliferation and signaling such as cyclin A1, IL6, and caveolin 2. Cyclin A1 has
been shown to be involved in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis (36–37). IL6 has been
implicated in androgen independent activation of AR (38), is elevated in the sera of patients
with advanced disease (39–41), and may be involved in intracrine production of androgens
(42). CAV2 expression was demonstrated to be increased in poorly differentiated prostate
tissues (43). We speculate that activation of PIM1 in prostate cancer cells may repress genes
involved in tumor suppression and differentiation and activate genes important in cellular
transformation.
While we have not demonstrated the mechanism by which PIM1 phosphorylation of AR
S213 changes AR target gene expression, we speculate that AR phosphorylation likely alters
interaction with chromatin, as recently demonstrated for AR S81 (44), as well as interaction
with cofactors resulting in differential target gene expression as demonstrated for
phosphorylated glucocorticoid receptor interaction with Mediator (MED) 14 (45).

Understanding the impact of AR S213 phosphorylation by PIM1 is also complicated by the
fact that PIM1 is likely to have AR independent effects on chromatin since PIM1
phosphorylates HP1γ (19) and histone H3 (46). These findings are consistent with the fact
that our data demonstrates synergistic effects of PIM1 overexpression with hormone
treatment.

Author Manuscript

Hormone refractory prostate cancer still relies on the AR, but the impact on AR-mediated
gene transcription is pleiotropic during cancer progression. AR pathways associated with
proliferation, de-differentiation, and decreased apoptosis are upregulated while AR
pathways that inhibit proliferation, induce differentiation, or promote apoptosis are
downregulated. Gene profiling of normal prostatic epithelium, low to high grade prostate
cancers, and metastatic prostate cancers revealed that androgen receptor signaling and
certain androgen receptor pathways that inhibit proliferation, increase apoptosis, or induce
differentiation are downregulated in high grade prostate cancers and metastatic disease (47–
48). Consistent with PSA mRNA downregulation in metastases (48), a recent study
demonstrated that the proportion of tumor cells expressing low amounts of PSA increase in
high grade cancer and hormone refractory cancers (49). Thus, although the finding that PSA
is repressed in the presence of PIM1 appears to be paradoxical considering that PSA is
associated with tumor growth, studies have shown that the utility of PSA as a surrogate
marker for disease progression decreases as tumors become more de-differentiated in high
grade and hormone refractory tumors (49–50). It is possible that P-AR S213 expression
marks cells that express low amounts of PSA and are resistant to androgen ablative
treatments.

While PIM1 overexpression in prostate cancer (12–13, 25) is detectable by
immunohistochemistry, there is no easy method to determine when PIM1 is active in vivo
since its activation does not correlate with phosphorylation detectable by an antibody. While
not predictive of disease outcome, detection of AR phosphorylated at S213 is much more
prevalent in aggressive, hormone refractory prostate cancer (Figure 8). Our studies indicate
that AR is a direct target of PIM1 and as such, detection of P-AR S213 can serve as an in
vivo marker for activated PIM1. This may be important to stratify patient populations who
might benefit from small molecule PIM1 inhibitors in development. In fact, a PIM1 inhibitor
was in a trial for lymphoma and prostate cancer (see clinical trials.gov Identifier
NCT00848601, Safety of SGI-1776, A PIM kinase inhibitor to treat docetaxol refractory
prostate cancer and relapsed/refractory non Hodgkin’s lymphoma). There is also some
evidence that PIM1 inhibitors may enhance chemotherapy because treatment of prostate
cancer cells with PIM1 inhibitors enhances sensitivity to taxane-based chemotherapy (51).
Thus our studies indicate that AR is a PIM1 substrate and phosphorylated AR may serve as
a biomarker for activated PIM1.

were extensively washed in lysis buffer and eluted from the agarose beads with 3X FLAG
peptide (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunopurified FLAG-AR was incubated with 1 µg of
recombinant protein GST-GSK3 (Cell Signaling), GST-PIM1, active (Millipore; Billerica,
MA), or His-Akt, active (Millipore) in kinase buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with
0.2mM ATP. The reaction proceeded for 30 minutes at 30°C. In vitro kinase reactions were
conducted in Assay Dilution Buffer I and Magnesium/ATP cocktail (Millipore). 3µg of HisBad (Millipore) or GST-GSK3 and 250ng of His-Akt or GST-PIM1 kinases were incubated
for 10 minutes at 30°C. 1µg of full length His-Androgen Receptor (Abcam) and 250ng GSTPIM1 were incubated for 30 minutes at 30°C in the presence of 10nM R1881. Inhibition of
phosphorylated AR in the presence of PIM kinase inhibitor was performed as previously
described (27) with some modifications. Immunopurified FLAG-AR and 1µg of GST-PIM1
kinase reactions proceeded in the presence and absence of 100µM Pim kinase 1/2 inhibitor
V for 30 minutes at 30°C. Kinase reactions were terminated with the addition of 3X SDS
sample buffer.
Sphere Formation
VCaP stables lines were plated at a low density on ultra-low attachment plates (Corning,
Corning, NY) and cultured the absence of serum and hormone as previously described (54),
with the addition of N2 (Invitrogen).
Quantitative RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as previously described
for PSA, Nkx 3.1, and RPL19 (55) with the following modifications. RNA was reverse
transcribed using First Strand cDNA Synthesis for Real-Time PCR (USB; Cleveland, OH)
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with HotStart-IT SYBR green qPCR Master
Mix (2X), (USB). The RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAHS-135) and primers for CCNA1, IL6,
and CAV2 were purchased from SABiosciences (Valencia, CA). The primers sequences
used to quantify IGFBP5 were F 5’-ATTGTGACCGCAAAGGATTC and R 5’AGGTGTGGCACTGAAAGTCC.
Human Prostate Cancer Tissue Microarrays, Immunohistochemistry, and Scoring

Author Manuscript

Human prostate cancer tissue microarrays were obtained from the New York University
(NYU) Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center. Tissues were acquired according to each institution’s institutional review board’s
policies. The NYU tissue microarray contains 65 cases represented as 4 cores per case. The
samples are designated as being either hormone refractory (n=18) or non-hormone refractory
(n=47), which includes hormone naïve (n=18) samples. The samples range from Gleason
score 5 through 10. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) tissue
microarray contains 68 cases represented as 3 cores per case. The cases are designated as
being either biochemically recurrent (n=33) or non-recurrent (n=35). The samples range
from Gleason score 4 through 9. Other clinical parameters include PSA levels, Gleason
score, stage, recurrence, disease free interval or capsular penetration.

Immunohistochemistry and image acquisition was conducted as previously described (29)
on the NYU and MSKCC tissue microarrays for P-AR S213. In addition, the NYU
microarray was immunostained for PIM1 (Abcam). Protein expression in each core was
assessed using the semi-quantitative weighted histoscore method, representing staining
intensity (negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3) and the percentage of positive
cells within each intensity category. The final histoscore was determined for each case by
taking the average histoscore of all the present cores. Both TMAs were scored by two
independent observers. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined by t-test.

normalized to 10 nM R1881 in the absence of PIM1 and set to 100% activity. C) VCaP cells
were transfected with lacZ reporter, ARR3-Luciferase reporter, and increasing amounts of
PIM1 in the presence and absence of 10nM R1881. D) LNCaP cells were transfected as
above in the presence of 10nM R1881. E and F LNCaP cells stably expressing vector only

(vo), or PIM1 (pools#1 and #2) were steroid starved overnight and then treated in the
presence and absence of 10nM R1881 for 24 hours. qPCR was performed to quantify
transcript levels of PSA and Nkx3.1 (E) and AR and PIM1 protein expression was
determined (F). Graphs are representative of at least three independent experiments. Error
was calculated using the standard deviation.

Figure 7. PIM1 Affects AR Target Gene Expression

A) LNCaP stable cell lines overexpressing vector only (vo pool #1) or PIM1 (pool #2) were
treated as in Figure 6E and the gene expression of IGFBP5, CCNA1, IL6, and CAV2 was
quantified by qPCR. B) VCaP cells were transfected with siRNA against PIM1 and treated
as above. Gene expression of PSA and IGFBP5 was quantified by qPCR and protein
expression of AR and PIM1 determined C. Graphs are representative of at least three
independent experiments. Error was calculated using the standard deviation.

Figure 8. Expression of Phosphorylated AR S213 in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancers

A) Immunohistochemistry on prostate tissues using antibodies against P-AR S213 (A–C) or
PIM1 (D–F). For P-AR S213, a separate histoscore was given for nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining positivity while PIM1 was present only in the nucleus. The total histoscore ranges
from 0 for a completely negative sample to a maximum score of 300. Magnification is 10X
with insets of the same tissue at a 40X magnification. B) Histoscores (H-Scores) of hormone
refractory (HR) vs non- hormone refractory prostate cancers and Gleason score 5–7 vs
Gleason 8–10 were compared. The distribution of H-Scores is shown with the mean
