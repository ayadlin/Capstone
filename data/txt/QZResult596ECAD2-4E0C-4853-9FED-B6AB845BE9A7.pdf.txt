The Use of Recombinant Erythropoietin for
the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced
Anemia in Patients With Ovarian Cancer
Does Not Affect Progression-Free or Overall
Survival
Leigh A. Cantrell, MD1; Shannon N. Westin, MD2; and Linda Van Le, MD3

BACKGROUND. Studies have suggested that erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) may affect progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in a variety of cancer types. Because this finding had not been explored previously in ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma, the authors of this report analyzed their ovarian cancer population
to determine whether ESA treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia affected PFS or OS. METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of women who were treated for ovarian cancer at the corresponding author’s institution
over a 10-year period (from January 1994 to May 2004). Treatment groups were formed based on the use of an ESA.
Two analyses of survival were conducted to determine the effect of ESA therapy on PFS and OS. Disease status was
modeled as a function of treatment group using a logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to
compare the groups, and a Cox proportional hazards model was fit to the data. RESULTS. In total, 343 women were
identified. The median age was 57 (interquartile range, 48-68 years). The majority of women were Caucasian (n ¼
255; 74%) and were diagnosed with stage III (n ¼ 210; 61%), epithelial (n ¼ 268; 78%) ovarian cancer. Although the
disease stage at diagnosis and surgical staging significantly affected the rates of disease recurrence and OS, the
receipt of an ESA had no effect on PFS (P ¼ .9) or OS (P ¼ .25). CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that
there was no difference in cancer-related PFS or OS with use of ESA in this cohort of women treated for ovarian canC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a renal hormone that increases the production of erythrocytes in response to hypoxia.
Recombinant human EPO was introduced initially 20 years ago to treat anemia diagnosed in renal dialysis patients. Two
preparations of recombinant EPO-stimulating agents (ESAs) currently are marketed in the United States (epoetin alfa and
darbepoetin alfa), and both have similar clinical results and safety profiles; a third preparation, epoetin beta, is available
outside of the United States. ESA use in patients with cancer was initiated to reduce the need for erythrocyte transfusion.
When administered to patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia, treatment with an ESA consistently decreases the
need for erythrocyte transfusion by 50%.1 Additional studies have correlated the use of ESAs with improvements in fatigue and productivity in patients with cancer.2-4 Initial labeling or treatment guidelines for ESAs included use for chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) and anemia associated with cancer and allowed for the initiation of ESA treatment at
hemoglobin (Hgb) levels 11 g/dL.
After the use of ESAs became commonplace for the treatment of CIA, the safety of that use came into question. A
few studies suggested that prognosis was compromised with use of ESAs, specifically with regard to disease progression

and survival. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled
trials (N ¼ 13,933 patients) reported that ESA use in
patients with cancer was associated with increased mortality and shortened survival; however, when ESAs were evaluated using only studies that treated CIA (N ¼ 10,441
patients), there was no difference in survival.5 This led to
class labeling revisions in 2007 and 2008. In 2010, an
updated meta-analysis (N ¼ 15,323 patients) confirmed
that there was no significant affect of ESAs on survival or
disease progression in patients who received ESAs for the
treatment of CIA or anemia from cancer.6 Current US
Food and Drug Administration recommendations state
that ESAs are not to be used if there is intent to cure and
should be used only in patients who are receiving chemotherapy with Hgb levels <10 g/dL.7 Recent literature
indicates that there also may be an undefined association
with decreased survival.8
It is estimated that 21,500 American women were
diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2009.9 Standard ovarian
cancer therapy includes surgical cytoreduction followed
by platinum-based chemotherapy, which has known myelosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects and is associated
with a high rate of anemia. In addition, women with ovarian cancer generally are postmenopausal, elderly and are
less tolerant of anemia. A recent Gynecologic Oncology
Group study of 5 different chemotherapy regimens noted
a 20% incidence of grade 3 or 4 anemia.10 In a review of
the role of epoetin beta in patients with gynecologic
malignancies, Cornes and Boiangiu opined that women
with gynecologic cancer may comprise a subgroup of cancer patients who potentially benefit the most from treatment with epoetin.11 We sought to examine this cohort of
women with ovarian cancer who received chemotherapy
with or without an ESA before the ESA labeling changes
and to determine whether there was a difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After obtaining an institutional review board exemption,
all women who were diagnosed with ovarian or primary
peritoneal cancer and received chemotherapy between
January 1994 and May 2004 were identified from medical
records at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. Charts were reviewed, and demographic, treatment,
and survival data were abstracted. Demographic data were
collected and included age at diagnosis, race, body mass
index (BMI), tobacco use, and pertinent comorbidities.
Disease and treatment data included disease stage at diagCancer

nosis, histology, type of chemotherapy, blood transfusion,
and use of ESA (epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa). Survival
data included dates of recurrence and death and the date
of last follow-up or discharge to hospice.
ESA use during the study period was initiated when
Hgb values fell below 11 g/dL at the discretion of the
treating physician. All patients had a workup for correctable causes of anemia (ie, iron studies). No patient was
treated who had an Hgb level>11g/dL. Patients received
either weekly epoetin alfa (40,000 IU dosing) or darbepoetin alfa (2.25 mcg/kg dosing), which was added to
ESA treatment regimens when it became available in
2002. During the study period, epoetin and darbepoetin
alfa were analyzed together as ‘‘ESA received.’’ Many
patients in this cohort received chemotherapy with curative intent and would not have been compliant with current ESA labeling. Various chemotherapy regimens
were used and the majority contained a platinum agent
(Table 1).
We measured PFS from the date of diagnosis to the
date of first recurrence. Disease-specific OS was measured
from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from disease or entry into hospice. Patients who had recurrent disease or were disease free were censored at the date of their
last visit (through March 30, 2009) to calculate OS in
months. Covariates that were included in the analysis
included age at diagnosis (as a continuous variable), race,
BMI, disease stage at diagnosis, histology, tobacco use,
and diagnosis of hypertension. BMI was defined according to World Health Organization criteria.12
For survival analyses, patients were divided into 2
groups: those who received an ESA (Group 1) and a control group of patients who did not receive an ESA (Group
2). To determine PFS, disease status was modeled as a
function of treatment group with the covariates mentioned above using a logistic regression model. All covariates were included in the initial model, and backward
selection (the elimination of variables analyzed one by one
that were not statistically significant) was used to remove

Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare the
groups, and a Cox proportional hazards model was fit to
the data using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC). Treatment with ESA status was forced to remain in
the model as the variable of interest.

RESULTS
In total, 343 women were identified using the inclusion
criteria. The median age of our population was 57 years
(interquartile range, 48-68 years). The majority of
patients were Caucasian (255 women; 74%), and AfricanAmerican women composed the next most common
patient group (78 women; 23%). The majority of patients
were diagnosed with stage III (210 women; 61%), epithelial (268 women; 78%) disease. The median follow-up of

1222

both groups was similar (35 months in the ESA-treated
group and 37 months in the untreated group). Most
women were normal weight (134 women; 39%), had
never used tobacco (237 women; 69%), and were normotensive at diagnosis (213 women; 62%). No patient was
treated if their Hgb level was >11 g/dL. Ninety patients
(26%) received an ESA. Notable differences between
treatment groups included older age at diagnosis, a greater
proportion of women with hypertension, fewer patients
who used tobacco, and a greater proportion of stage IV
disease in the ESA treatment group. Table 2 describes the
demographics of the study group in detail.
Disease stage at diagnosis and surgical staging status
had significant effects on disease recurrence. Patients who
had stage III or IV ovarian cancer had greater odds (OR,

developing recurrent disease compared with women who

had early stage disease (OR, 2.3; P ¼ .15). Similarly,
women who did not undergo surgical staging had greater
odds of developing recurrent disease (OR, 7.9; P ¼
.0003). Although a difference in the recurrence rate by age
was noted, older women trended toward more recurrent
disease; the difference did not reach statistical
significance.
Our variable of interest, treatment with an ESA, had
no effect on PFS or the disease recurrence rate (OR, 1.04;
P ¼ .9). Twenty-six percent of the study population
received an ESA. Among the women who had no evidence
of disease, 20% received an ESA. Among the women who
remained alive with disease, 36% had received an ESA.

regression model, which contained only the significant
variables and ESA, are presented in Table 3. Backward
selection was used to remove variables from the model in
the following order: hypertension, histology, race, BMI,

nificantly increased the risk of death. It is noteworthy that
African-American patients also experienced a significant
increase in the risk of death (HR, 1.4; P ¼ .039)
(Table 4).
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to generate survival
curves, which also demonstrated the lack of an association
between receiving an ESA and disease-specific OS; the
median survival of patients who received an ESA was 35
months compared with 37 months for patients who did
not receive an ESA (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
In the current retrospective study of patients with ovarian
cancer, there was no difference in PFS or disease-specific
OS between patients who did and did not receive ESAs. It
is important to note that our patients received ESAs for
the treatment of CIA, and the targeted Hgb levels were
consistent with product labeling and recommendations at
that time. Although higher disease stage and age were
associated with worse outcomes, we did not observe that
the receipt of an ESA had an impact on either PFS or OS.
Concerns regarding the safety of ESAs and their possible association with disease progression started to

emerge in 2003. Studies of patients with head and neck
cancer who were receiving radiation therapy suggested
that locoregional PFS was compromised in patients who
received ESAs. ESAs were added to radiation study protocols initially, because it was hypothesized that increasing
Hgb concentrations would raise tumor oxygenation,
resulting in improved treatment.13,14 Several breast cancer
studies also demonstrated that survival was decreased for
patients who received an ESA with their chemotherapy.15
Criticisms of those studies have included inadequate analysis of prognostic factors, targeting Hgb levels >12 g/dL,
and imbalanced control and treatment groups.15 However, several studies with targeted Hgb levels <12 g/dL
have also suggested a compromised outcome. In a study of
156 patients with lung cancer, survival was decreased in
patients who received ESAs with a target Hgb level <12
g/dL; however, that study was not designed to determine
differences in survival.16
This group of studies collectively led to concern
regarding compromised disease outcome, however there
are studies that did not demonstrate compromised PFS or
overall survival. Many of those studies used a target
Hgb level consistent with product labeling. Unfortunately, 1 limitation of this group of studies, is that they
were not designed prospectively to study survival as an
outcome.17-20 In a recent meta-analysis of darbepoetin a
administered to patients with CIA, no association was
observed with increased disease progression or death. It is
noteworthy that, although there has been concern that
negative results, from off-label studies using Hgb targets
of >12 g/dL, were caused by using the higher Hgb level,
in that analysis, PFS reportedly was not effected when
Hgb levels were 12 g/dL or 13 g/dL.3,6 To our knowledge,

1224

no studies of ESAs used in accordance with labeling
guidelines (treatment of CIA with a starting Hgb level
<11 g/dL) have demonstrated a negative impact on
survival.
To date, there have been only 3 studies of ESA treatment in patients with gynecologic cancers. The results
from 2 studies of patients with cervical cancer suggested
that ESAs have a negative impact on this particular patient
population. In a retrospective review of women with cervical cancer who received radiation therapy as their primary
treatment, ESA treatment was correlated with disease recurrence and death.21 In a prospective Gynecologic Oncology Group study of 114 patients, an ESA was given
concurrent with radiation plus weekly platinum, and a
target Hgb level of 14 g/dL was used. The hypothesis for
that trial was that increasing oxygen-carrying capacity
would improve the therapeutic effect of radiation. The
study was terminated early because of a higher incidence of
thrombotic events in the ESA-treated group; and, at 30
months of follow-up, there was no difference in PFS or
OS. In both of those studies, ESA was administered with
elevated target Hgb levels.22 Wilkinson et al prospectively
studied patients with ovarian cancer who received ESA
treatment to determine the impact on quality of life and
hematologic changes. Those authors incidentally observed
a nonsignificant trend toward worsening disease among
patients who received ESAs and concluded that this finding
was associated with disease stage.23 To our knowledge, no
studies have evaluated the impact of ESAs on the outcome
of ovarian cancer patients who received chemotherapy.
The mechanisms by which ESAs may affect cancer
behavior are multiple and complex. EPO receptor expression has been observed in a variety of tumor cell lines in
vitro (breast, lung, central nervous system, head and neck)
and in a variety of tissues, including cardiomyocytes,
smooth muscle, and vascular endothelium. These observations have raised concern that there may be direct stimulation of tumor growth through these receptors.
However, in a recent, extensive study of EPO receptor
expression in tumor cell lines, no ESA-induced activation
of the EPO receptor was observed.24 In addition, in studies by Sinclair et al, EPO messenger RNA was detected in
all cell types without evidence of subsequent signaling or
expression.25 Thus, evidence demonstrating the reliable
function of these receptors and signaling and lack of evidence of their functionality in mouse models have not
supported this route as a clear mechanism for tumor
growth. Direct stimulation of endothelial cells by ESAs is
another consideration for promotion of tumor growth.26

ESAs in Ovarian Cancer/Cantrell et al

It is hypothesized that stimulation of endothelial cells
would lead to further neovascularization of tumors, resulting in increased growth or reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy or radiation. Finally, some investigators believe
that ESA stimulation of platelet activation may stimulate
tumor growth. Studies currently are underway to determine whether the latter 2 hypotheses have biologic
validity.
The recent controversy surrounding the use of ESAs
has made many physicians wary of prescribing them and
has limited their utility. In the current study, we observed
no correlation between ESA use and the rate of ovarian
cancer progression or survival in patients who had
received an ESA within labeling guidelines. We acknowledge the weaknesses inherent to retrospective studies and
do not propose that our results should lead to prescribing
changes. However, we do believe that these results should
continue to stimulate relevant discussion and research
regarding the true risks and benefits of ESAs, and we caution against the broad rejection of ESA use in a patient
population that may find symptomatic relief from the
benefits of ESA therapy.
