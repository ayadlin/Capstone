Insulin Receptor A and IGF-1R in AML – Letter
Nicolas Chapuis1,2,3, Catherine Lacombe1,2,3, Jerome Tamburini1,2,4, Didier Bouscary1,2,4, and Patrick Mayeux1,2

In support of the recent article by Wahner Hendrickson
and colleagues (1), we wish to share our data on the implication of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1)/IGF-1 receptor
(IGF-1R) signaling in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Indeed, we recently reported that a constitutively activated
IGF-1R is expressed in AML cells (2). The authors hypothesize that an autocrine/paracrine stimulation of IGF-1R or
insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) could explain the overactivation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and ERK/
MAPK signaling in AML cells, thereby providing a rationale
for dual IGF-1R/IR-A inhibition. In fact, in our previous
works, we clearly established the existence of an IGF-1
autocrine production (3) and its critical role in PI3K deregulation in a cohort of 40 primary AML samples (2). Our
results suggest that this PI3K/Akt activation is mediated
through the IGF-1R rather than the IR-A, as specific inhibition of IGF-1R signaling with a neutralizing anti–IGF-1R
antibody (αIR3) markedly inhibits the Akt constitutive
phosphorylation in 70% of AML samples with deregulated
PI3K activity (2). Interestingly, according to Wahner Hendrickson's data, IR-A signaling might potentially be implicated in PI3K deregulation in αIR3-resistant patients.
Conversely, we assume that deregulation of ERK1/2 does
not occur downstream of the IGF-1R, as αIR3 does not
decrease ERK1/2 phosphorylation (2). The implication of
IR-A in ERK1/2 constitutive activity is unlikely because,
in our experiments, exogenous IGF-1 stimulation, which also triggers IR-A activation (1), never led to an increase of

ERK1/2 phosphorylation (2). Finally, a constitutive ERK1/2
phosphorylation is detectable even in samples without
constitutive PI3K activity, thereby suggesting that both
deregulations proceed from different mechanisms (2).
Altogether, Wahner Hendrickson and colleagues suggest
that targeting IGF-1R and IR could have a significant therapeutic value in AML. Accordingly, we found that αIR3 inhibits the proliferation of primary AML cells but does not
induce apoptosis (2). Interestingly, dual IGF-1R and IR-A inhibition may have stronger activity in AML, as suggested by
the induction of apoptosis by BMS-536924 (1), thereby underlying a potential contribution of IR-A signaling to the survival
of AML cells. However, it cannot be ruled out that other
kinases involved in cell survival are also inhibited by
BMS-536924, as the specificity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
is generally uncertain. Furthermore, generalized IR inhibition might induce more serious side effects than blocking
IGF-1R alone, especially towards the glucose metabolism.
Indeed, insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia have been reported in mice treated with BMS-554417,
another dual IGF-1R/IR inhibitor (4). Finally, how to introduce these new strategies in the arsenal of AML therapy
remains an ongoing challenge.
