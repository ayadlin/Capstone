BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that the tumor proliferation index has prognostic significance in
patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Patients in most of studies, however, have been treated with
relatively traditional chemotherapy regimens. At the authors’ institution, patients with MCL received an
aggressive chemotherapy regimen: rituximab plus hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (Rhyper-CVAD). METHODS: The authors assessed the proliferation rate of MCL using immunohistochemistry
and an antibody specific for Ki-67 in 71 untreated patients who subsequently received R-hyper-CVAD. The
study group included 59 patients who had classic MCL and 12 patients who had the blastoid variant of
MCL. RESULTS: For the entire study group and for the group of patients with classic MCL, a proliferation
index of >20% Ki-67-positive cells was correlated significantly with shorter failure-free survival. There was
no correlation between the proliferation index and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the proliferation index in patients with MCL predicted prognosis in those who uniformly received

Original Article

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct type of Bcell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that accounts for approximately 6% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.1 Histologically, most cases of MCL, known as the classic or common
variant, are composed of a monotonous proliferation of
small-to-intermediate sized, neoplastic lymphocytes with
scant cytoplasm and more or less irregular nuclei. Blastoid
variants of MCL also are described; these variants have
aggressive histologic features and a high mitotic rate.1 In
both the classic and blastoid variants of MCL, the neoplastic
cells are positive for pan-B-cell antigens and CD5 and
are negative for CD10, CD23, and BCL-6. The
t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation is a hallmark of MCL, juxtaposing the cyclin-D1 gene CCND1 at 11q13 with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) on the derivative
chromosome 14, resulting in cyclin D1 over-expression.
Several other molecular alterations have been identified in
subsets of MCL cases, most of which dysregulate the cell
cycle or impair the DNA damage-response pathway.2
It has been demonstrated in several clinical studies3-5
that the prognosis for patients with MCL is poor. The
clinical course of MCL usually is aggressive, and the median survival is 3 to 5 years. In most of these studies, MCL
patients were treated in a heterogeneous manner, mostly
with standard chemotherapy regimens, and the most
commonly used regimen was combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP).
Attempts to predict the prognosis for patients with MCL
using clinical and laboratory parameters, such us the
International Prognostic Index (IPI), have been suboptimal, although a newly developed MCL IPI (MIPI) may
prove to be more useful.6 The poor prognosis for patients
with MCL led investigators at our institution and others
to develop dose-intensified treatment approaches to treat
MCL; the results are promising and suggest that dose
intensification is superior to CHOP chemotherapy.7-9 At
our institution, Romaguera and colleagues7 have used rituximab plus hyperfractioned cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with
rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate-cytarabine (Rhyper-CVAD) as frontline therapy. This approach has
been proven as an effective cytoreductive regimen in
patients with MCL, achieving an overall complete
response/unconfirmed complete response rate of 87%
and a 3-year failure-free survival (FFS) rate of 64% after a
median follow-up of 40 months.7
1042

By using gene expression profiling methods, Rosenwald and colleagues10 demonstrated that MCL has a
unique signature. They also observed that the expression
of a relatively small number of genes involved in proliferation subdivided MCL patients into 4 groups that correlated with prognosis. Others have used Ki-67 expression,
assessed by immunohistochemical methods, to assess the
proliferation index (PI) in MCL tumors and demonstrated that this approach has prognostic value.11-15 Most
patients in those Ki-67 studies received various traditional
chemotherapy regimens, most commonly CHOP. There
is also a recent study in which a subset of 96 patients with
MCL received R-CHOP.15 Currently, however, it is
unknown whether the PI also has prognostic significance
in patients with MCL who receive dose-intensified chemotherapy regimens, such us the R-hyper-CVAD developed at our institution. In the current study, we assessed
the prognostic value of the PI, as assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemical analysis, in a group of patients with
MCL who uniformly received R-hyper-CVAD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
The study group included 76 patients who were previously untreated, had a diagnosis of MCL confirmed at the
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and had available pretreatment paraffin blocks or unstained slides for immunohistochemical analysis. At our institution, patients who
have MCL with a purely mantle zone pattern are not
treated with R-hyper-CVAD and, thus, were not included
in this study. All patients were treated uniformly according to the protocol, as described previously.7 The diagnosis of MCL was established using the criteria of the World
Health Organization classification.1 The survival analysis
included 71 patients; 5 patients were excluded because of
inadequate length of follow-up.

Pathologic Analysis
The type of biopsy specimens reviewed included 53
lymph node, 9 gastrointestinal tract (GI), 5 tonsil, 3
spleen, 1 bone marrow, 1 nasopharynx, 1 submandibular
mass, 1 palatine tongue, 1 base of tongue, and 1 eyelid
mass. All specimens histologically met the criteria for

either classic or blastoid MCL, had a B-cell immunophenotype, and either overexpressed cyclin D1 or carried the
t(11;14)(q13;q32). The latter was confirmed by either
conventional cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization, as described previously.16 In most specimens,
both cyclin D1 overexpression and the t(11;14) were
demonstrated.

Staging and Therapy
All patients received a pretreatment staging evaluation
that included a complete physical examination, chest radiograph, upper and lower GI endoscopy, bilateral bone
marrow aspirations and biopsies, whole body computerized tomography scans, and gallium and/or positron
emission tomography scans when indicated, as described
previously.7 Patients also had blood drawn for a complete
blood count with differential, serum levels of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) and b2-microglobulin, and other
routine chemistry studies. Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis for lymphoid cell surface markers was
performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate
specimens from each patient. A serum LDH level >618
IU/L (normal range, 313-618 IU/L) was considered high.
A b2-microglobulin level >3.0 mg/L (normal range, 0.71.8 mg/L) was considered high, as determined in an earlier study.7 After signing of informed consent approved
by the Institutional Review Board, all patients were enrolled into a prospective clinical trial that included administration of the R-hyper-CVAD chemotherapy regimen
for 6 to 8 cycles.7

was divided by the total cells counted and was expressed as
a percentage for the PI.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed comparing patients who
had tumors with high versus low PI. The cutoffs that initially were considered were the median percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells for the entire study and, separately, for the group of patients who had the classic MCL
variant. Four additional cutoffs for the entire study group
also were assessed based on a review of histograms: 5%,
10%, 15%, and 20% Ki-67-positive tumor cells (Fig. 1).
Failure-free survival (FFS) was defined as the time from
the beginning of treatment to initial treatment failure or
to last follow-up. Treatment failure was defined as recurrence or progression of disease, death caused by disease or
toxic effects, and death caused by treatment-related second malignancies.7 Overall survival (OS) was measured
from the onset of therapy to the date of last follow-up or
death from any cause, whichever occurred first. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to measure actuarial survival using the log-rank test. The statistical independence
of individual prognostic factors was evaluated by multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards
model. The PI was compared with a variety of clinical and
laboratory features using the chi-square test and the Fisher
exact test. For part of this analysis, we assessed both the
traditional IPI and the recently proposed MIPI.6 Statistical analysis was carried out using Statview software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, Calif).

Immunohistochemical Analysis
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using
previously published methods.17 Briefly, formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 lm thick) were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded series of
alcohol solutions. A monoclonal antibody specific for
Ki-67 (DAKO, Carpinteria, Calif) was used for immunostaining. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was carried out
using a preheated target retrieval solution (DAKO). The
PI was calculated by evaluating the entire slide stained for
Ki-67, selecting a representative area, and manually
counting 1000 cells. The number of Ki-67-positive cells

Study Group
There were 60 men and 16 women, and the median
patient age was 62 years (range, 42-82 years). The median
follow-up was 51 months for the entire study group.
Sixty-three tumors were identified as the classic variant of
MCL, and 13 tumors were identified as blastoid variants
of MCL. The patterns of growth were diffuse in 30
tumors, nodular and diffuse in 27 tumors, nodular in 18
tumors, and nodular and mantle zone in 1 tumor.

Association of the Proliferation Index With
Clinical, Histologic, and Laboratory
Parameters in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Table 1 summarizes the association of the PI with various
clinical, histologic, and laboratory parameters. The median PI for the entire study group was 11.4%. Within the
group of patients with the classic MCL variant, the median PI was 10% (range, 1%-55%), whereas patients with
the blastoid variant MCL had a median PI of 22% (range,
12%-87%; P ¼ .0038; Mann-Whitney test). Figure 1A
provides examples of the classic MCL variant with either a
low or high PI. The PI was not correlated with presenting
clinical or laboratory features in the entire study group
(Table 1). Similarly, the PI was not correlated with the IPI
(score range, 0-4) (Table 1).
A new prognostic index has been proposed for
assessing the prognosis of MCL patients, the so-called
MIPI.6 For the current analysis, we could assess only 64
patients, because data were incomplete for 7 patients. The
1044

percentage of Ki-67-positive cells (the PI) was not correlated with low risk versus intermediate/high risk according
to the MIPI (Table 1). Only the blastoid variant of MCL
had a positive, significant correlation with a high PI using
the 11.4% cutoff (Fisher exact test; P ¼ .01).
Univariate Survival Analysis
Complete clinical and laboratory parameters and followup data were available on 71 patients for survival analysis.
The significance of the established prognostic parameters
initially was evaluated by using univariate statistical analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method. Age, sex, histology
(classic vs blastoid variant), serum b2-microglobulin or
LDH levels, the presence of B-symptoms, the presence of
peripheral blood involvement, and IPI score (0-2 vs >2)
were not correlated with OS or FFS.
For the assessment of PI and prognosis, we initially
used a median of 11.4% Ki-67-positive cells as a cutoff for
the entire study group. After a median follow-up of 51

months, 20 of 36 patients (56%) who had MCL with a
high PI failed therapy compared with 12 of 35 patients
(44%) patients who had MCL with a low PI. At 5 years,
the FFS rate was 32.2% for patients who had MCL with a
high PI versus 62% for patients who had MCL with a low
PI (P ¼ .14; log-rank test). Regarding survival, 12 of 36
patients (33.3%) who had MCL with a high PI died compared with 13 of 35 patients (37%) who had MCL with a
low PI. The OS rate at 5 years was 50% for patients who

had MCL with a high PI versus 66.5% for patients who
had MCL with a low PI (P ¼ .51; log-rank test). For the
subset patients with the classic MCL variant, using a
median of 10% Ki-67-positive cells as a cutoff, we
observed a significant difference in the FFS rate. At 5
years, the FFS rate was 37% for patients who had MCL
with a high PI versus 70% for patients who had MCL
with a low PI (P ¼ .028; log-rank test) (Fig. 2A). There
was no difference in OS using the 10% cutoff.
We also assessed other Ki-67 percentages as cutoffs
for the entire group of patients with MCL and for the subset of patients with the classic MCL variant. Cutoffs of
15% and 20% both were statistically significant, but the
20% cutoff yielded the lowest P value. By using this cutoff, the 5-year FFS rate was 28.6% for patients who had
MCL with a high PI (>20%) compared with 53.1% for
patients who had MCL with a low PI (20%; P ¼ .003)
(Fig. 2B). Similarly, in the group with the classic MCL
variant, the 5-year FFS rate was 14% for patients who had
MCL with a high PI compared with 58% for patients who
had MCL with a low PI (P ¼ .0005) (Fig. 2C). Table 2
summarizes the differences in 5-year FFS depending on
the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells (PI) chosen as a cutoff. Regarding OS, none of the PI cutoffs that we tested
yielded a significant difference at 5 years. By using the
20% cutoff, the OS rate was 51.4% for patients who had
MCL with a high PI versus 64.3% for patients who had
MCL with a low PI (P ¼ .19; log-rank test).

Multivariate Survival Analysis
Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards
model was applied to the entire study group using PI (Ki67 expression) as the standard covariate and introducing
all other prognostic variables 1 by 1 as covariates into the
model. This analysis revealed that a high PI was an independent, adverse prognostic factor associated with a
shorter FFS (P ¼ .03) along with age 60 years
(P ¼ .033) and high serum levels of b2-microglobulin
(P ¼ .055) (Table 3). These prognostic parameters were
not significant for OS.

approaches. Although response rates to single-agent and
combination chemotherapy regimens range from 40% to
70%, they are short-lived, disease progression develops in
6 to 18 months, and the median survival is 30 to 40
months.7-9 At our institution, the poor prognosis for
patients with MCL lead to the use of dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens for these patients as a part of clinical
trials; currently, the regimen that we use is R-hyperCVAD.7 This regimen has yielded a response rate of 93%,
which increased to 100% after the addition of high-dose
cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by
autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation.7
Molecular studies of MCL have revealed several
genetic alterations that dysregulate the cell cycle.2 The

cytogenetic hallmark of MCL, the t(11;14)(q13;q32),
results in the overexpression of cyclin D1, which accelerates G1/S phase cell cycle transition. Rosenwald and
colleagues demonstrated that10 the proliferation gene
expression signature of MCL has prognostic significance.
Ki-67 is a well accepted marker of cell proliferation that
can be tested easily by immunohistochemical methods in
routinely processed archival tumor specimens. Ki-67 is a
nuclear antigen that is expressed in all phases of the cell
cycle except in resting cells (G0 phase). Others investigators have used Ki-67 immunohistochemistry as an alternative to gene expression profiling to assess MCL
proliferation.11-15 In every study, the immunohistochemical assessment of Ki-67 has demonstrated prognostic significance in patients with MCL. In the largest study of
304 patients by Tiemann and colleagues, the percentage
of Ki-67-positive cells subdivided patients with MCL into
3 prognostic groups in which higher percentages of Ki67-positive cells predicted shorter OS.13 In earlier studies,
however, patients with MCL were treated with traditional
chemotherapy regimens, most often CHOP chemotherapy; and, in most studies, patients with MCL were not
treated in a uniform manner. In a recent study by Determann and colleagues,15 Ki-67 also had prognostic
significance in 96 patients who received R-CHOP chemotherapy. To our knowledge, the prognostic significance of
Ki-67 expression, which has been evaluated by several
groups,7-9 has not yet been assessed in patients with MCL
who received intensive chemotherapy regimens With the
high complete remission rate and improved survival of
patients with MCL who receive the R-hyper-CVAD regimen at our institution, we wondered whether Ki-67
expression would retain prognostic significance in this
group of patients.
Within the group with classic MCL, using a median
of 10% Ki-67-positive cells as a cutoff, a high Ki-67 PI
was correlated with worse 5-year FFS. By using a higher
cutoff of 20% Ki-67-positive cells, a high Ki-67 PI was
correlated with poorer 5-year FFS both for the group with
classic MCL and for the entire study group. Therefore,
our results indicate that tumor PI has prognostic importance even in patients with MCL who are treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens, such as the R-hyperCVAD regimen used at our institution.
The current results for patients with the blastoid variant of MCL in this study agree with previous data from
Cancer

March 1, 2009

our institution. Previously, Romaguera et al18 compared
patients who had the classic MCL variant with patients
who had the blastoid variant. The rates of complete remission in that study were slightly lower for patients with the
blastoid variant (79% vs 89%), but the difference was not
statistically significant (P ¼ .72). At a median follow-up
of 57 months, there was a plateau in the FFS curve for
patients with blastoid MCL, and the median OS was not
reached. The improved outcome of patients who have
MCL with blastoid cytologic features suggests the potential for long-term remission after intense, nonmyeloablative chemotherapy in this subgroup of patients.
In summary, the data presented here demonstrate
that the PI has prognostic significance in patients with
MCL. The data support the results of earlier studies but
also supplement those prior studies by demonstrating that
the MIPI has prognostic value in patients who uniformly
receive an aggressive chemotherapy regimen, R-hyperCVAD, which is used to treat patients with MCL at our
institution and elsewhere.
