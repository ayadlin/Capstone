Abstract
Cyclophilin A (CypA) has been reported to be overexpressed in
cancer cells, especially in solid tumors. To determine the role
of CypA in tumorigenesis, we investigated the induction of
CypA as well as the role it plays in cancer cells. Here, we have
shown that induction of CypA is associated with hypoxia in a
variety of cells, including DU145 human prostate cancer cell
line. Our analysis of the CypA promoter clearly showed that
CypA up-regulation is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor1A transcription factor. Interestingly, overexpression of CypA
prevented hypoxia- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and this
was associated with the suppression of reactive oxygen species
generation and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane
potential, whereas small interfering RNA–based CypA knockdown aggravated these factors. These results suggest that
CypA is important in tumorigenesis, especially in tumor
apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3654–62]

Introduction
Cyclophilin A (CypA), the prototypical member of the cyclophilin
family, is a highly conserved protein in mammalian cells (1).
Traditionally, the cyclophilins are composed of four isoforms
(cyclophilins A, B, C, and D). Sequence homology analysis of human
CypA shows that it is highly homologous to human cyclophilin B
(CypB), C (CypC), and D (CypD; ref. 2). Although CypB and CypC
have the NH2-terminal sequences that target them to endoplasmic
reticulum, CypA, an 18-kDa protein, is predominantly localized
in the cytoplasm (2). It is known as an immunophilin and a cytosolic receptor for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (1).
In addition, it possesses enzymatic peptidyl-prolyl cis–transisomerase (PPIase) activity, which is essential for protein folding
in vivo. In addition, the PPIase activity of cyclophilins has recently
been shown to be involved in diverse cellular processes, including
intracellular protein trafficking (3, 4), mitochondrial function (5, 6),
pre-mRNA processing (7), and maintenance of multiprotein complex stability (3).
Although little is known about the function of CypA in cancer
cells, it has been recently reported that CypA is overexpressed in
many cancer cells, including human pancreatic cancer cells (8, 9),
oral squamous cancer cells (10, 11) and non–small cell lung cancer
(12, 13). Recent reports have shown that CypA interacts with the
retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) in Jurkat T cells

(14). Although the role of CypA in apoptosis is not clear at this
point, several reports show that CypA is released from cardiac
myocytes in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation and may protect
cardiac myocytes from oxidative stress–induced apoptosis (15),
and that CypA also protects other cells from oxidative stress–
induced apoptosis (16, 17). These reports suggest that CypA might
be important for tumorigenesis in solid tumors.
To elucidate the role of overexpressed CypA in cancer cells, we
examined CypA induction under hypoxic conditions and investigated the effect of CypA on hypoxia- or cisplatin-induced cell
death. In this study, we show, for the first time, that CypA is
transcriptionally induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)
transcription factor. Furthermore, we show that overexpressed
CypA in cancer cells protects cells against cellular stresses, including hypoxia and cisplatin treatment, at least in part as a result of
its antioxidant function.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and hypoxia. Human prostate carcinoma DU145, human
cervical carcinoma HeLa, human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 p53+/+ and
p53 / cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Mouse
embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3, human hepatoblastoma HepG2 and human
embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells were propagated in DMEM supplemented
as above. Hypoxic conditions were generated by placing the cells in the
hypoxia chamber (0.5% O2) for indicated periods of time.
Reverse transcription-PCR. For the analysis of CypA mRNA, total RNA
was prepared from cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego,
CA). Total RNA (2 Ag) was amplified by a two-step protocol using the avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse-transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and Taq
polymerase. Primers for amplifying CypA transcripts were as follows:
forward, 5¶-GCAAGCTTACCATGGTCAACCCCACC-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GCGGATCCGAGTTGTCCACAGTCGGA-3¶. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified as an internal control for reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR). Amplified products were separated on 1% agarose gel.
Construction of plasmids for CypA promoter analysis. The CypA
promoter sequence was analyzed using MatInspector of Genomatrix.4 Four
hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) candidates were identified in the CypA
promoter. For the construction of luciferase reporter plasmids, 1,012 bp of
the CypA promoter sequence were serially deleted by 200 bp through PCR.
The deleted fragments were cloned into pGL3 basic vector (Promega) with
KpnI and HindIII. For mutational analysis, each putative HRE site on the
CypA promoter was mutated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis.
Primers used for constructing luciferase reporters containing various
regions of the CypA promoter or mutated HRE sites are as follows:

Luciferase assay. NIH3T3, DU145, and HeLa cells were transfected with
0.5-Ag amounts of the pGL3 basic-derived plasmids, together with internal
control plasmid pSV-h-gal (Promega). The cells were exposed to hypoxia for
12 h and harvested in 150 AL of lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 25 mmol/L
Gly-Gly, 15 mmol/L MgSO4, and 2 mmol/L EGTA (pH 8.0)]. Luciferase and
h-gal activities (data not shown) were measured using 20 AL of each cell
lysate using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA), and luciferase
activity was normalized based on h-gal activity, as reported previously (18).
Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility
shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to previous
reports (19–21). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was done with
oligonucleotides (CypA-WT, 5¶-CCTTTTATACCACGTTCGGC CCCG-3¶;
CypA-M, 5¶-GCCCCTTTTATACTATATTCGGCCCCGCCC-3¶) derived from
the CypA promoter sequences. Sense and antisense strands of oligonucleotides were annealed into double-stranded oligonucleotides and were
labeled with [g-32P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United
Kingdom). Nuclear extracts were obtained from DU145 and NIH3T3 cells
after hypoxic incubation for 12 h. The nuclear extracts (10 Ag) were
incubated in the presence of 5 binding buffer [25% glycerol, 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L DTT, 1 mg/mL
poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid), 5 mmol/L EDTA]. For the interaction of the nuclear extracts and radiolabeled oligonucleotides, the reaction
mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For a competition
study, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucloetides was added to
the reaction mixture before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The
samples were run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were
then dried and exposed to X-ray film with an intensifying screen at 80jC.
MTT assay. Cell viability was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) conversion assay in a 12-well
plate. The culture medium was replaced with 1 mL medium containing
0.5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and incubated for 60 min at
37jC. The blue-colored tetrazolium crystals resulting from mitochondrial
enzymatic activity on the MTT substrate were solubilized with 150 AL
DMSO. The absorbance was read at 595 nm in a microplate reader (BioRad). Cell survival was expressed as the percentage of absorbance relative
to that of untreated cells.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were grown to 60% confluence and treated with
2 mmol/L thymidine for up to 24 h to arrest the cells in the S phase. The
cells were washed in PBS and released in fresh medium for specified periods
of time. For cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and
fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4jC. The fixed cells were centrifuged
and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide
and 0.2 mg/mL RNase-A and then incubated at 4jC for 1 h. DNA content
was determined by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) to analyze the cell cycle.
Analysis of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (#y m)
measurement. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using 2¶-7¶dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA, Molecular Probe) dye.
Human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells were grown to 80% confluence in
complete media and treated with and without cisplatin (30 Amol/L). Then,
the cells were loaded with 10 Amol/L DCF-DA at 37jC for 30 min and
resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. Fluorescence was measured by a flow
cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). The mean DCF fluorescence
intensity was measured with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm.
Untreated cells were used as a reference for ROS levels. The mitochondrial
membrane potential was measured using 3, 3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine
iodide dye (DiOC6; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After treatment with
cisplatin (30 Amol/L), cells were loaded with 40 nmol/L DiOC6 for 40 min at

www.aacrjournals.org

37jC and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS before the flow-cytometric analysis.
DiOC6 was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence was analyzed at 525 nm.
Subcellular fractionation. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer
[250 mmol/L sucrose, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4)],
homogenized, and centrifuged at 900  g for 10 min. Then, the supernatants
were recentrifuged at 10,000  g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants
(cytosol) were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting
with anti–cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX4) antibody (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA) to confirm that the cytosolic fraction was successfully
separated from the mitochondrial fraction (data not shown).
Hoechst staining. Cells were incubated for 30 min with Hoechst 33342
(Molecular Probes) loading dye and fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde.
After washing with ice-cold PBS thrice, stained cells were monitored using
the confocal laser microscope (META 510, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).
Apoptotic cells were identified by nuclear condensation and fragmentation.
Stable transfection. pcDNA3-CypA/WT (3 Ag) or pcDNA3 (3 Ag) alone
was transfected into DU145 cells using GenePORTER (Genlantis, San Diego,
CA). Cells used for stable transfection were cultured in the selective
medium with 600 mg/mL G418 for a month. Then, drug-resistant individual
clones were isolated and transferred to a six-well plate for further
amplification in the presence of selective medium.
Small interfering RNA. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specific to either
CypA (CypA-siRNA) or control sequence (control-siRNA) were prepared by
Eurogene tech (Intron Biotechnology, Kyungki, Korea). siRNA (0.5 Ag) was
transfected into cells using METAFECTENE transfection reagent (Biontex,
Munich, Germany). siRNA target sequences were as follows: CypA-siRNA
(sense, 5¶-UGACUUCACACGCCAUAAUdTdT-3¶; antisense, 5¶-AUUAUGGCGUGUGAAGUCAdTdT-3¶) and control-siRNA (universal negative control).
The efficiency of siRNA-based interference of CypA was monitored by
immunoblot.

propagated in HEK 293 cells. The viral DNA constructs were confirmed by
HindIII restriction enzyme digestion (data not shown). Adenovirus stocks
were purified through a cesium gradient for 4 h (444,000  g, 10jC) and
titrated using a standard plaque assay. Cells were infected with
recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 300 for
24 h to express exogeneous CypA. Uninfected or infected cells with adenoGFP (Ad) were used as a negative control for CypA expression.

CypA in Tumorigenesis

by hypoxia, RT-PCR analysis was done using mRNA extracted from
NIH3T3 fibroblasts exposed to hypoxia for indicated periods of
time. CypA transcripts increased after 3 h incubation and kept
increasing up to 12 h under hypoxic conditions, whereas GAPDH
mRNA used as a control was unchanged (Fig. 1A). To confirm this
result, we repeated the RT-PCR analysis using a drug that mimics
hypoxia, CoCl2, instead of incubation under hypoxic conditions.
An increase in CypA mRNA was also observed after 12 h of CoCl2
treatment (Fig. 1B). We assumed that the increase in gene expression of CypA occurred at the transcriptional level by increasing
the transcriptional rate or at the post-transcriptional level by
stabilizing mRNA. To rule out the possibility of stabilizing mRNA,
the level of CypA mRNA in hypoxia was compared with that in
normoxia by induction of CypA mRNA in hypoxia for 9 h and
subsequent treatment with actinomycin D (5 Ag/mL) up to 12 h
under hypoxic or normoxic conditions. Actinomycin D was used to
inhibit the de novo synthesis of the CypA transcript. As shown in
Fig. 1C, the half-life of CypA mRNA turned out to be similar in both
conditions. These results showed that transcriptional activation,
not mRNA stabilization, causes induction of CypA under hypoxic
conditions. To determine whether accumulation of CypA mRNA
would lead to an elevated level of CypA protein, immunoblotting
analysis was done using total cell lysate from NIH3T3 fibroblasts
subjected to hypoxic conditions for the specified periods of time.
As shown in Fig. 1D, a rapid increase in the CypA protein level was
detected after 3 h exposure to hypoxia and kept continuously
increasing up to 12 h exposure, whereas the actin protein level,
used as a control, was constant.
CypA promoter is activated by the HIF-1A transcription
factor. Up-regulation of CypA by hypoxia led us to explore whether
the CypA promoter has a HRE, the HIF-1a binding site. First,
bioinformatic analysis of the promoter of the human CypA gene
was done to search for a consensus HRE sequence 5¶-CGTG-3¶. We
identified four putative HRE sequences located at 47 bp (HRE1),
77 bp (HRE2), 309 bp (HRE3), and 589 bp (HRE4) upstream to
the CypA start codon (Fig. 2A).
To identify which HRE was responsive to hypoxia, several
luciferase reporter constructs, containing various regions of the
1,012-bp CypA promoter, were constructed (Fig. 2A). The activity
of the CypA promoter was monitored by luciferase assay after
12 h incubation under hypoxic conditions. Neither under normoxic
nor hypoxic conditions was any luciferase activity observed for the
empty pGL3-Basic plasmid. However, for pGL3-CypA-200 and
pGL3-CypA-1012, there was an almost 2-fold increase in luciferase
activity under hypoxic conditions compared with normoxic
conditions (Fig. 2B). Therefore, this suggested that pGL3-CypA200 and pGL3-CypA-1012 showed hypoxia-induced luciferase
activity because they contain the HRE1 and HRE2 sites. Further
deletion analysis of the CypA promoter showed that any luciferase
construct without the HRE2 site did not respond to hypoxic
conditions (data not shown). To confirm that the HRE2 site is
responsible for the induction of hypoxia, we mutated each HRE site
(5¶-CGTG-3¶) to 5¶-TATA-3¶ on the CypA promoter. pGL3-CypA47M, pGL3-CypA-309M, and pGL3-CypA-589M showed about a
2-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to hypoxia
compared with normoxic conditions. By contrast, the luciferase
activity of pGL3-CypA-77M containing the mutated HRE2 was not
induced by hypoxia, indicating that the HRE2 site is responsible for
the induction of CypA by hypoxia. HIF-1a is known to be a major
transcription factor in hypoxia (22). Thus, we overexpressed HIF-1a
by transfection of pcDNA3-HIF-1a and compared the luciferase

activity of the transfectants in normoxia with that of controls to
determine whether HIF-1a induces the transcription of CypA. As in
the hypoxia experiments, all luciferase constructs containing a
functional HRE2 showed about a 2-fold increase in luciferase
activity when pcDNA3-HIF-1a was cotransfected (Fig. 2B ).
Interestingly, pGL3-CypA-200 displayed a low luciferase activity

under normoxic conditions, compared with other CypA luciferase
constructs (Fig. 2B). In addition, pGL3-CypA-200 showed a weaker
basal luciferase activity, compared with pGL3-CypA-1012 in the
HIF-1a transfection experiment, indicating that other cis-acting
elements required for the general expression of CypA are located
upstream of HRE2. We finally located a putative GC box at 317 bp
from the starting codon of CypA (data not shown).
Next, because CypA has been reported to be expressed more in
tumor than in normal cells (8–13), the luciferase activity of pGL3CypA-1012 was measured in cancer cells, such as DU145 and HeLa
cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, the luciferase activity was increased by
3.5- and 3-fold in these cancer cells by hypoxia and HIF-1a
transfection, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that
HIF-1a regulates CypA expression in response to hypoxia.
Binding of HIF-1A to the HRE sequence of CypA promoter.
To determine if HIF-1a binds to the HRE2 sequence of the CypA
promoter, EMSA experiments were done using nuclear extracts
from DU145 cells incubated for 12 h under hypoxic conditions.
Oligonucleotides containing wild-type (WT) or mutated version of
HRE2 (see Materials and Methods) were used in the experiments.
First, we tested whether HIF-1a binds to the HRE2 sequences of the
CypA promoter under normoxic conditions. 32P-labeled oligonuleotides containing WT HRE2 were complexed with nuclear protein
extracts from DU145 cells cultured under normoxic conditions,
whereas the 32P-labeled oligonuleotides containing mutated HRE2
were not (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). The complex was more easily
observed when cultured under conditions of hypoxia, whereas
oligonuleotides containing mutated HRE2 did not form complexes
(Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 5). The specificity of this complex was verified
by competitive inhibition with an excess of the same unlabeled
oligonucleotide (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 6). We verified the results by
reproducing consistent EMSA data with nuclear extracts from
NIH3T3 (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that upregulation of CypA is indeed mediated by HIF-1a in response to
hypoxia.
CypA desensitizes cells to hypoxia- and cisplatin-induced
cell death by suppression of ROS increase and loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential. HIF-1a has been known
to play an important role in growth and survival of solid tumor
cells (23, 24). We have shown that CypA is induced under hypoxic
conditions via the HIF-1a transcription factor. Therefore, we
hypothesized that CypA might play an important role in growth
and survival of solid tumor cells, especially in response to cellular
stress including hypoxia, cisplatin, and oxidative stress such as
H2O2 treatment.
First, to assess the role of CypA in hypoxia-induced cell death, we
did a MTT assay after DU145 cells were stably transfected with
mock vector, pcDNA3-CypA/WT or transiently transfected with
CypA-siRNA and were exposed to hypoxia for up to 4 days. Before
the hypoxic experiments, the expression level of exogenous CypA
was evaluated in the transfected cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A).
Compared with endogenous CypA, exogenous CypA showed an
almost 2-fold increase in expression. In addition, the expression of
CypA was almost 95% suppressed by specific siRNA interference
(Fig. 3A). As presented in Fig. 3B, CypA transfectants exposed to
hypoxia for 4 days showed significantly higher cell survival rates
than mock transfectants; CypA knockdown showed the highest cell
death rate among the transfectants, indicating that CypA protects
cells from hypoxia-induced cell death.
Next, we monitored the chemoresistance of CypA transfectants
and CypA knockdown to cisplatin by MTT assay. Cisplatin gave rise

to cellular death, but CypA transfectants showed a higher cell
survival rate than mock transfectants. By contrast, CypA knockdown cells showed significantly lower cell survival rates than
control siRNA transfectants (Fig. 3B). Cisplatin is known to induce
apoptosis partly through the generation of ROS (25–27). To determine if overexpression of CypA attenuates apoptosis by suppression of increased ROS generation, we tested cellular resistance to
H2O2 treatment in both CypA transfectants and CypA knockdown samples. As shown in Fig. 3B, H2O2 caused cellular death,
but CypA transfectants showed a higher cell survival rate than
mock transfectants. By contrast, CypA knockdown samples showed

a significantly lower cell survival rate than control siRNA transfectants. Therefore, we assessed for antioxidant activity of CypA in
each transfected cell line. As clearly shown in Fig. 3C, treatment
with cisplatin gave rise to the generation of ROS. Interestingly,
CypA overexpression did not increase ROS significantly, whereas
CypA knockdown aggravated ROS generation. In addition,
mitochondrial membrane potentials were also analyzed with or
without cisplatin treatment. As presented in Fig. 3D, CypA
knockdown showed the most significant cisplatin-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, followed by mock-transfected
samples. CypA-overexpressed cells led to a negligible cisplatininduced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential.
These data show that CypA overexpression suppresses cisplatininduced ROS increase and the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential. Next, we monitored cellular ROS and mitochondrial
membrane potential in CypA transfectants and CypA knockdown
samples under hypoxic and H2O2 treatment conditions. As in
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, hypoxia and H2O2 treatment induced
a similar pattern of changes in ROS generation and depolarization
of mitochondrial membrane in these transfected cells (data not
shown). Therefore, our findings show that CypA protects cells from

stress-induced cell death at least in part as a result of its antioxidant role.
Cytoprotective roles of CypA against apoptosis. The effects
of hypoxia, cisplatin, and H2O2 treatment on the processing of
apoptosis-related protein PARP and cytochrome c release from
mitochondria to cytoplasm in CypA transfectants and CypA
knockdown were investigated using immunoblotting. Incubation
of cells under hypoxic conditions or treatment with cisplatin or
H2O2 showed cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate, PARP, as
indicated by the appearance of the 85-kDa cleaved PARP product
(Fig. 4A and B). Accordingly, the extent of cytochrome c release
was also increased with cellular stress. As expected, overexpression
of CypA reduced the processing of PARP and cytochrome c release
(Fig. 4A). By contrast, CypA knockdown increased the processing of
PARP and cytosolic release of cytochrome c significantly, compared
with control-siRNA (Fig. 4B). In addition, suppression of CypA
in cisplatin-induced apoptosis was verified by Hoechst staining
(Fig. 4C). These data show that CypA overexpression desensitizes
responses of apoptosis-related proteins to hypoxia, cisplatin, and
H2O2, suggesting that overexpressed CypA in cancer cells protects
cells by attenuating stress-induced apoptosis.

Cancer Research

Cytoprotective role of CypA against cell death is not limited
to a cell type. Next, to determine whether our findings are limited
to human prostate DU145 cancer cells, we also tested for a
suppressive role of CypA in hypoxia-, cisplatin-, or H2O2-induced
apoptosis in HepG2 and HeLa cells. First, after establishing a CypA
adenovirus or CypA knockdown in HepG2 and HeLa cells, the
protein expression level of CypA was tested. In CypA infectants,
exogenous CypA was expressed almost 1.5-fold more than
endogenous CypA (Fig. 5A). As expected, siRNA-based CypA
inhibition also suppressed CypA expression effectively both in
HepG2 and HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, CypA infectants
showed a reduced cell death compared with mock samples,
whereas CypA knockdown samples gave rise to increased cell
death, when subjected to hypoxia, cisplatin, or H2O2 treatment.
These results clearly indicate that the ability of CypA to suppress
apoptosis is not limited to specific cells.
We also investigated whether CypA knockdown aggravates
apoptosis in p53-defective cells because p53 is one of the key
regulators of apoptosis. For this study, we successfully suppressed
CypA by siRNA inhibition in HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 /
cell lines (Fig. 5A). The resistance of CypA knockdown to cellular
stress was monitored in HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 /
backgrounds. In both HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / cells,
CypA knockdown gave rise to increased cell death, compared with
control-siRNA, when subjected to hypoxia, cisplatin, or H2O2
treatment. Therefore, we concluded that CypA knockdown can
significantly aggravate apoptosis even without p53 (Fig. 5D).
CypA does not affect cellular proliferation. Recently, it has
been proposed that CypA might enhance tumor growth by
affecting cellular proliferation (12). To examine this hypothesis in
our cell lines, we monitored the effects of CypA on cell cycle
progression and on the doubling time of cells. Mock, CypA
transfectant, and CypA knockdown were grown, synchronized by
2 mmol/L thymidine, and released in fresh medium for the
specified periods of time and then subjected to fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to determine DNA content.
As presented in Fig. 6A, normal cell cycle progression was observed
in each cell line. We could not see any difference in DNA content
among mock, CypA transfectants, and CypA knockdown over time
up to 16 h. In addition, there was no difference in the doubling time
(Fig. 6B). Their doubling time was about 15 h. These data suggest
that the cellular function of CypA may be related to apoptosis,
rather than cellular proliferation, in our tested cell lines.

Discussion
To date, the role of CypA in cancer pathogenesis has not been
extensively investigated, although some recent reports have shown
CypA overexpression in many cancer cells (8–13). We first
investigated whether CypA could be induced by HIF-1a under
hypoxic conditions, a microenvironment in solid tumors. We
also investigated the role of overexpressed CypA in cancer cells. In
this paper, we showed that transcription of the CypA was induced
by hypoxic conditions through a mechanism that involves binding
of HIF-1a to the HRE2 site located at 77 within the CypA
promoter. We reproduced these results using a variety of cell lines,
including DU145 and HeLa cells. Therefore, induction of CypA in
response to hypoxia is not limited to a specific cell line.
Interestingly, luciferase activity of pGL3-CypA-200 was lower than
that of pGL3-CypA-1012 (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the
promoter region from 1,012 to 201 might have other cis-acting

elements required for general transcriptional induction. In fact, we
found a putative GC box ( 317 bp) in the region (data not shown).
Because a functional GC box is a positive regulatory element in
the promoter, the putative GC box is possibly responsible for the
high constitutive expression of CypA gene.
Cancer cells are more resistant to stress than normal nontransformed cells. They use multiple defense systems against a
variety of stresses, including hypoxia, radiation, and anticancer
drugs. Under hypoxic conditions, cancer cells can survive by
inducing HIF-1a expression (10, 22). Therefore, HIF-1a has been
suggested as a potential regulator of hypoxia-induced apoptotic
cell death (23). Induction of apoptosis by hypoxia in HIF-1a

CypA in Tumorigenesis

transfected cells has been shown to be more difficult than in cells
that do not express HIF-1a. This led us to speculate that the
resistance of HIF-1a transfected cells to hypoxia-induced cell death
may be, at least in part, due to the ability of HIF-1a to up-regulate
CypA expression in cells; this was because our data showed that
hypoxia induced expression of CypA through direct activation of
HIF-1a, and that the induced CypA seemed to resist cellular
stresses, such as hypoxia insult, cisplatin treatment, and oxidative
stress. In addition, our results also showed that CypA knockdown
aggravated cell death induced by hypoxia, cisplatin treatment, and
oxidative stress in the tested cell lines. Because a cytoprotective
role of CypA was also observed even in p53-defective cells, CypA
may be a good target for new chemotherapeutic drug development
to alleviate cisplatin resistance frequently observed in p53-defective
cancer patients.
Interestingly, overexpression of CypA did not offer any resistance
to other anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil
(data not shown). Considering that apoptosis induced by these
drugs is not directly related to the increased ROS, although ROS are
generated after treatment with these drugs (28, 29), we thought
that the suppression of the increased ROS generation may be
involved, at least in part, in the cytoprotection of overexpressed
CypA against cellular stresses, such as hypoxia and cisplatin
treatment; this hypothesis turned out to be true in this case
(Fig. 3C and D). Accordingly, evidence that CypA functions as an
antioxidant has been recently accumulated (16, 30–32). Our
previous study also showed that overexpressed CypA removed
ROS generated by cyclosporin A (17). Moreover, CypA has been
reported to be secreted in response to ROS in vascular smooth
muscle cells (33). Therefore, it seems that the antioxidant role of
CypA is at least partly critical for cytoprotection of overexposed
CypA against hypoxia and cisplatin treatment. We propose here
that the antioxidant function of CypA might require PPIase activity
because the CypA R55A mutation, which is defective in PPIase
activity, also aggravated ROS generation and depolarization of the
mitochondrial membrane (data not shown). Consistent with our

proposal, cyclosporin A, a well-known inhibitor of PPIase activity in
CypA, has been reported to have chemotherapeutic effects in a
variety of cancer cells (34, 35). The molecular mechanism of CypA
as an antioxidant should be pursued in future studies.
Recently, Howard et al. reported on the importance of CypA to
tumor growth in vivo, specifically on proliferation and apoptosis
(12). We also investigated the possibility that CypA may influence
proliferation by monitoring cell cycle progression and doubling
time of CypA transfectants and CypA knockdown samples. We
found no difference in cellular proliferation among mock, CypA
transfectants, and CypA knockdown samples. Our data are
consistent with a recent report showing that loss of CypA in
mouse embryonic stem cells had no detectable effect on cell
growth or viability (36). The discrepancy between our findings and
those of Howard et al. (12) concerning the involvement of CypA in
proliferation is not understood at this time. Therefore, we cannot
rule out the possibility that CypA might affect cellular proliferation
in specific cell lines.
In conclusion, our data suggest that CypA may play a critical role
in tumorigenesis by reducing apoptosis both under hypoxic
conditions and with cisplatin treatment. The cytoprotective role
of CypA seems to require PPIase activity. Therefore, the PPIase
activity of CypA may be a good chemotherapeutic target for
treatments that could facilitate to alleviate the chemoresistance in
tumor cells including p53-defective tumors. We continue to study
CypA to further understand its cytoprotective mechanisms, which
will hopefully lead to new chemotherapeutic strategies against
solid tumors.
