ABSTRACT
Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent pro-inflammatory eicosanoid that is derived
from arachidonic acid, and its signaling is known to have a tumor-promoting role
in several cancer types. In this study, we investigated whether enhanced LTB4
signaling confers resistance to the cytostatic transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)
response. We found that LTB4 pretreatment or ectopic expression of BLT1, a high
affinity LTB4 receptor, fully abrogated TGF-β1-induced cell cycle arrest and expression
of p15INK4B and p27KIP1. Mechanism study revealed that LTB4-mediated suppression
of TGF-β1-induced Smad3 activation and growth inhibition was due to enhanced
phosphorylation of Smad3 linker region (pSmad3L) through activation of BLT1NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX)-reactive oxygen species (ROS)-epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-extracellular signal-activated
kinase1/2 (ERK1/2)-linked signaling cascade. Furthermore, the LTB4/BLT1 signaling
pathway leading to pSmad3L was constitutively activated in breast cancer cells and
was correlated with TGF-β1-resistant growth of the cells in vitro and in vivo. In
human breast cancer tissues, the expression level of pSmad3L (Thr179) had a positive
correlation with BLT1 expression. Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time
that the induction of pSmad3L through BLT1-NOX-ROS-EGFR-PI3K-ERK1/2 signaling
pathway is a key mechanism by which LTB4 blocks the anti-proliferative responses of
TGF-β1, providing a novel mechanistic insight into the connection between enhanced
inflammatory signal and cancer cell growth.

INTRODUCTION

chemokines act to create a favorable microenvironment
for the progression of tumor, and inflammatory signaling

the contribution of inflammatory signal to cancer
development remain to be elucidated.
Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an oxidized fatty acid
derived from a multi-step 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)
pathway in arachidonic acid metabolism, is a wellknown chemotactic agent for recruitment to, activation,
and survival of phagocytes at the site of tissue injury
[2, 3]. Overexpression of LTB4 is frequently observed
in the airways of asthma patients and its levels are
correlated with the severity of asthma [4], indicating its
importance in inflammatory disease processes. Recently,
mounting evidences suggest that 5-LO metabolites are
also linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of human
cancers, including colon, liver, and pancreatic cancers.
For example, the blockade of LTB4-extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway suppresses the
proliferation and survival of colon cancer cells [5]. LTB4
also is a potential mediator of oncogenic hepatitis B virus
X-induced proliferation of hepatoma cells [6]. Celecobix,
a cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor, exerts its anti-cancer effect
primarily via down-regulating LTB4 production in colon
cancer cells [7]. In addition, two LTB4 receptor subtypes,
BLT1 and BLT2, are overexpressed in various human
cancers [8, 9]. LY293111, an antagonist of BLT1, induces
apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer and lymphoma
cells and reduces the growth of tumor xenografts [10,
11]. Although these evidences clearly suggest that LTB4/
BLT axis may play an important role in the progression of
human cancer by increasing proliferation and survival, the
molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an
important cytokine that modulates diverse cellular
functions [12]. The most well defined TGF-β1 response
is cell growth inhibition. TGF-β1 causes cell cycle arrest
at the G1 phase by suppressing cyclin-dependent kinase
activity through the induction of p15INK4B and p21WAF1
[13, 14]. Another key event in the anti-proliferative
TGF-β1 action is down-regulation of growth promoting
factors such as c-Myc and Id1, and those responses are
lost in certain types of tumor cells [15-17]. Therefore,
maintenance of the cytostatic function of TGF-β1
is important for prevention of early-stage cancer
development [17].
TGF-β1 transmits signals from the cell surface to
the nucleus by activating a signaling cascade that involves
Smad proteins through a hetero-oligomerization of type
I and type II transmembrane TGF-β receptors (TβRI and
TβRII) [17]. Smad3, one component of the Smad signaling
pathway, plays a central role in mediating TGF-β1 growth
inhibitory signal from receptors to the nucleus. For
example, TGF-β1-stimulated Smad3 binds to a SmadE2F site on the c-myc promoter together with cofactors
p107 and E2F4/5, resulting in c-myc repression [17, 18],
whereas overexpressed Smad3 induces transcription of
the CDK inhibitor p21WAF1 through functional cooperation
with the transcription factor Sp1, driving G1 cell cycle
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arrest [19, 20].
The Smad3 protein is composed of highly conserved
N-terminal MH1 domain (Mad-homology-1) responsible
for DNA binding and C-terminal MH2 domain (Madhomology-2) responsible for transactivation, which are
connected by a proline-rich linker region. Accumulating
evidences indicate that the linker region of Smad3
contains phosphorylation sites for several classes of
protein kinases and serves an important function in
regulating its transcriptional activity under physiologic
and pathologic conditions. For example, mitogenic
signal-activated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) or
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) causes
phosphorylation of Smad3 at the linker region, resulting
in suppression of TGF-β1-mediated Smad3 transcriptional
activation and growth inhibition [21, 22]. In contrast,
linker region phosphorylated Smad3 functions as a
stimulator of cell growth and invasion in oncogenic Rastransformed epithelial cells [23]. Based on these clues,
the Smad3 linker region phosphorylation (pSmad3L)
closely associates with cancer progression, although the
detailed cellular signaling mechanisms responsible for the
phosphorylation and its biological significance have not
been fully understood.
In this study, we showed that LTB4 negatively
regulates the anti-proliferative TGF-β1 signaling by
targeting Smad3 linker region. In mammary epithelial
cells, LTB4 strongly induced phosphorylation of Smad3
at the linker region via a BLT1-NOX-ROS-EGFR-PI3KERK1/2-linked signaling cascade, resulting in decreased
transcriptional activity of Smad3 and eventually impaired
growth inhibition response to TGF-β1. We also found
that the LTB4 signaling pathway leading to pSmad3L was
markedly activated in MDA-MB231 human breast cancer
cells and was correlated with TGF-β1-resistant growth
of the cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the level
of pSmad3L was higher in human breast cancer tissues
compared with that of normal counterparts and positively
correlated with BLT1 expression. These findings provide
an important mechanistic insight into the connection
between inflammatory LTB4 signal and cancer cell growth.

RESULTS
LTB4/BLT1 axis inhibits TGF-β1-induced cell
cycle arrest
Since LTB4 and its cognate receptors are implicated
in promotion of cancer cell growth [8, 9], we investigated
whether LTB4 signal would influence the antiproliferative
effect of TGF-β1. Cell cycle profiling by FACS analysis
showed that pretreatment of MCF10A cells with LTB4
completely inhibits TGF-β1-induced G1 cell cycle arrest,
but the effect is greatly diminished by either pretreatment

small interference (si) RNA (Figure 1A). Down-regulation
of endogenous BLT1 protein expression by siRNA BLT1
was confirmed by immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure
S1). In agreement with these results, TGF-β1-induced
p27KIP1 protein expression was significantly inhibited in
MCF10A (Figure 1B) and Eph4 (Figure 1C) mammary
epithelial cells that pretreated with LTB4. Similarly, TGFβ1-induced p15INK4B protein expression was strongly

attenuated in both HepG2-BLT1 (Figure 1D) and Mv1LuBLT1 (Figure 1E) stable cell lines that overexpress BLT1
compared to that of their control pcDNA3 vector cell
lines. Consistently, TGF-β1-induced p15INK4B-Luc reporter
gene expression was inhibited by LTB4 pretreatment
(Figure 1F) or ectopic expression of BLT1 (Figure 1G) in
a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. These results
strongly suggest that LTB4/BLT1 axis suppresses the antiproliferative function of TGF-β1.

LTB4/BLT1 axis inhibits TGF-β1-induced Smad3
activation and G1 arrest through increasing
Smad3 linker region phosphorylation

LTB4 or ectopic expression of BLT1 resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of TGF-β1-induced SBE4-Luc
reporter gene expression in HepG2 cells. In addition, LTB4
suppressed TGF-β1-stimulated transcriptional activity of
GAL4-Smad3 fusion protein in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2C). Consistent with these results,
electrophoretic mobility-shift assay revealed that the
increased binding affinity of Smad3 to SBE in response
to TGF-β1 is markedly diminished in HepG2-BLT1 cells
compared with HepG2-pcDNA3 control cells (Figure
2D). However, in Mv1Lu cells pretreated with LTB4,
no difference on Smad3 C-terminus phosphorylation
was seen with TGF-β1 treatment compared with LTB4untreated cells (Figure 2E). Similarly, the C-terminus
phosphorylation of Smad3 in Mv1Lu-BLT1 cells was

We next explored the mechanisms by which LTB4
inhibits TGF-β1-induced cell cycle arrest. Because Smad3
is well known to have an essential role in mediating
TGF-β growth inhibitory signal from the receptors to the
nucleus, we examined the influence of LTB4/BLT1 axis
on TGF-β1-stimulated Smad3 transcriptional activity. To
do this, we used the artificial SBE4-Luc reporter, which
comprises four tandem repeats of Smad-binding elements
(SBEs) and measures a Smad3/4-specific response [29].
As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, pretreatment with

TGF-β1 for 30 min. The protein levels of Smad3 and its phosphorylation were analyzed by immunoblot with Smad3 and phospho-Smad3

comparable with that of control Mv1Lu-pcDNA3 cells
after TGF-β1 treatment (Figure 2F). We also found that
TGF-β1 treatment causes the nuclear accumulation
of Smad3 in Mv1Lu-BLT1 cells without significant
difference to that seen in control Mv1Lu-pcDNA3 cells
(Figures 2G and 2H). These results indicate that LTB4BLT1 axis suppresses the transcriptional activity of Smad3
without affecting its C-terminus phosphorylation and
nuclear accumulation under TGF-β1 stimulation.
There is a growing body of evidences pointing to
an important role of Smad3 linker region phosphorylation
(pSmad3L) in the regulation of Smad3 function under
physiologic and pathologic conditions [21, 22] So, we

examined whether LTB4/BLT1 axis affects the pSmad3L.
Western blot analysis showed that LTB4 increases the
amounts of Smad3 phosphorylated at two serine and
threonine residues (Thr179 and Ser208) in the linker
region in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure
3A). Concentrations of LTB4 as low as 100 nM were
capable of inducing maximal phosphorylation of Smad3
at Thr179 or Ser208. Using 100 nM LTB4, induction
reached a maximum after 10 minutes of treatment with
LTB4 (Figure 3B). Consistent with this result, the Smad3
phosphorylation at Thr179 or Ser208 was markedly
enhanced in Mv1Lu-BLT1 cells compared with control
Mv1Lu-pcDNA3cells (Figure 3C), raising a possibility

that Smad3 linker region can be a potential target of LTB4/
BLT1 axis to blocks the anti-proliferative TGF-β1 signal.
To determine whether pSmad3L contributes
to the LTB4-mediated inhibition of TGF-β1-induced
Smad3 transcriptional activity and G1 cell cycle arrest,
we used Smad3 mutated at all four of the linker region
phosphorylation sites, including Thr179, Ser204, Ser208,
and Ser213, called Smad3EPSM [30]. In HepG2 cells, the
LTB4-, and BLT1-mediated inhibitions of TGF-β1-induced
SBE4-Luc (Figures 3D and 3E) or p15INK4B-Luc (Figures
3F and 3G) reporter gene expression were significantly
reduced by co-transfection with Smad3EPSM, but not by

co-transfection with Smad3WT. Similarly, western blot
analysis showed that BLT1-mediated suppressions of
TGF-β1-induced p27KIP1 (Figure 3H) and p15INK4B (Figure
3I) expression were significantly attenuated by ectopic
expression of Smad3EPSM, but not by ectopic expression of
Smad3WT. Together, these results suggest that the pSmad3L
is involved in the LTB4- and BLT1-mediated suppression
of TGF-β1-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity and G1
cell cycle arrest.

with that of control MCF10A-pcDNA3 cells, and NOX
inhibition by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI),
an inhibitor of flavoproteins, significantly diminished the
ROS generation in MCF10A-BLT1 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2B). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed
that MCF10A-BLT1 cells caused an increase in NOX1
and NOX4 expression levels (Supplementary Figure
S2C), suggesting that the LTB4/BLT1/NOX axis plays a
role in generating intracellular ROS. We thus investigated
whether ROS generated by NOX mediate the effect of

LTB4 signaling on pSmad3L and TGF-β1-induced cell
cycle arrest. In Mv1Lu cells, NOX inhibition by Rac1
inhibitor or DPI treatment markedly diminishes LTB4induced Smad3 phosphorylation at Thr179 or Ser208
(Figure 4A). Similarly, depletion of NOX4 by RNAi
knockdown clearly diminished the amount of Thr179-,
or Ser208-phosphorylated Smad3 in Mv1Lu-BLT1 cells
(Figure 4B). Conversely, lentivirus-mediated NOX4
overexpression in MCF10A cells markedly increased the
amounts of Smad3 phosphorylated at Thr179 or Ser208

compared with vector control infected cells (Figure 4C). In
parallel with this result, treatment of MCF10A cells with
H2O2 resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the
amount of Smad3 phosphorylated at Thr179 or Ser208
(Supplementary Figure S3), indicating an involvement of
NOX4 in the induction of pSmad3L by LTB4/BLT1 axis.
We further assessed the role of NOX4 in LTB4-mediated
inhibition of TGF-β1-induced Smad3 transcriptional
activity. As shown in Figures 4D and 4E, the LTB4-, or
BLT1-mediated suppression of TGF-β1-induced SBE4Luc reporter gene expression was significantly attenuated
by transfection with NOX4 siRNA. Conversely, ectopic
expression of NOX4 or H2O2 treatment drastically reduced
TGF-β1-induced SBE4-Luc reporter gene expression,
but the reduction was largely rescued by cotransfection
with Smad3EPSM (Figures 4F and 4G), suggesting that
ROS derived by NOX4 function downstream of BLT1
to mediate the suppression of TGF-β1-induced Smad3
transcriptional activity by LTB4.
We next investigated whether NOX4 is necessary
for the suppression of TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition
by LTB4/BLT1 signaling axis. Results showed that in
MCF10A and Mv1Lu cells, inhibition by LTB4 treatment
(Figure 5A) or BLT1 overexpression (Figure 5B) of TGFβ1-induced suppression of [3H]thymidine incorporation
was significantly attenuated by targeted depletion of
NOX4 (Figure 5A) or treatment with DPI (Figure 5B).
In addition, ectopic expression of NOX4 in Mv1Lu cells
strongly inhibited the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β1
on [3H]thymidine incorporation, but the inhibition was
significantly abolished by co-expression of Smad3EPSM
(Figure 5C). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the

BLT1-mediated suppression of TGF-β1-induced p15INK4B
and p27KIP1 expression was completely rescued by Rac1
inhibitor as well as by apocyanin, a specific inhibitor of
NOX (Figure 5D). RNAi-mediated depletion of NOX4
or ectopic expression of Rac1N17, a dominant negative
form of Rac1, also greatly diminished the inhibitory effect
of BLT1 on TGF-β1-induced p15INK4B-Luc reporter gene
expression (Figure 5E). In contrast, ectopic expression of
NOX4 or Rac1V12, a constitutively active form of Rac1,
effectively suppressed the reporter gene activity, but the
suppression was markedly rescued by Smad3EPSM (Figure
5F). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that NOX
plays a pivotal role in the negative regulation of TGF-β1induced growth inhibition by LTB4/BLT1 signaling axis.

The EGFR-PI3K-ERK1/2-pSmad3L-linked
cascade lies downstream of NOX in LTB4/BLT1
signal axis
The Smad3 linker domain undergoes regulatory
phosphorylation by several intracellular signaling
kinases [21, 22] To identify a signaling kinase involved
in the LTB4-mediated pSmad3L,we tested the effects of
inhibitors specific to several candidate kinases, including
AG1478 (an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor),
Calphostin C (a general protein kinase C inhibitor), KN92 (a calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
inhibitor), LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
inhibitor), BI-D1870 (a p90 ribosomal S6 kinase
inhibitor), BIX02189 (an extracellular signal-regulated

ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor), SP600125 (a c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase inhibitor), and SB203580 (a p38
kinase inhibitor). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the
increased amounts of Smad3 phosphorylated at Thr179 or
Ser208 in Mv1Lu-BLT1 cells were markedly diminished
by treatment with AG1478, LY294002, or U0126, whereas
similar concentrations of other inhibitors had no significant
effects (Figure 6A). LTB4-induced pSmad3L at Thr179 or
Ser208 was also abrogated by treatment with U0126 in a
concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure
S4). These results indicate an involvement of EGFR,
PI3-kinase, and ERK1/2 in LTB4 signaling pathway
leading to the phosphorylation of pSmad3L. We next
examined whether activation of these candidate kinases
is responsible for the BLT1-mediated suppression of
cytostatic TGF-β1 responses. We found that the BLT1mediated suppression of TGF-β1-induced SBE4-Luc
(Figures 6B and 6C) and p15INK4B-Luc (Figures 6D and 6E)
reporter gene expression was significantly attenuated by
treatment with U0126, LY294002, or AG1478, or by cotransfection with a plasmid expressing dominant negative
form of MEK1 or p85α. Furthermore, we established
that an EGFR-PI3-kinase-ERK1/2-linked cascade lies
downstream of NOX4 in LTB4/BLT1 signaling (Figures
6F, 6G, and 6H). Taken together, these results suggest that
the NOX-ROS-EGFR-PI3K-ERK1/2-pSmad3L-linked

cascade constitutes a fundamental intracellular signaling
pathway that mediates LTB4 signal from BLT1 receptor,
and activation of this pathway is responsible for the
suppression of antiproliferative TGF-β1 signal by LTB4.

Enhanced pSmad3L through BLT1-Rac1/NOX4EGFR-ERK1/2 linked signaling contributes to the
resistance of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells to
the TGF-β1 growth-inhibitory response in vitro
and in vivo
Loss of response to growth inhibition induced by
TGF-β1 is closely linked to the occurrence of cancer. We
thus evaluated the significance of aforementioned LTB4
signaling pathway in TGF-β1 resistance of cancer cells.
To do this, we chose MDA-MB231 human breast cancer
cells that were refractory to TGF-β1-induced growth
inhibition (Supplementary Figures S5A and S5B). FACS
and immunoblot analysis revealed that abundances of
intracellular ROS (Supplementary Figure S6), BLT1 and
NOX4 proteins, and phosphorylated forms of Smad3
(Thr179 and Ser208), ERK1/2, and EGFR proteins
(Figure 7A) were markedly greater in TGF-β1-resistant
MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells compared with TGFβ1-responsive non-malignant MCF10A cells. Depletion

of cancer cell proliferation by proinflammatory LTB4/BLT1 signal. In cancer cells, LTB4-evoked BLT1 activation induces production
of ROS by increasing NOX4 association with membrane, resulting in activation of EGFR through protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)
oxidation. The activated receptor induces the phosphorylation of Smad3 in the linker region through a EGFR-PI3K-ERK1/2- and EGFRERK1/2-linked signaling pathways, which leads to blockade of suppression of c-myc expression as well as induction of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors (p15INK4B and p27KIP1) in TGF-β signaling necessary for growth inhibition. The proposed mechanism suggests that the
proinflammatory LTB4/BLT1 signal contributes to promotion of cancer cell proliferation by tipping growth balance to cell cycle progression
through inhibition of cytostatic TGF-β1 signaling.

of BLT1 (Figure 7B) or NOX4 (Figure 7C) by siRNAmediated knockdown in MDA-MB231 cells resulted in
a marked reduction of the amount of phosphor-Smad3
(Thr179 and Ser208), phosphor-ERK1/2, and phosphorEGFR. Similar effects were observed in MDA-MB231
cells treated with U75302 (Supplementary Figure S7A)
or apocyanin (Supplementary Figure S7B). We then
examined whether the BLT1-linked signaling cascade
significantly contributes to the resistance of MDAMB231 cells to TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition.
RNAi-mediated silencing of BLT1 (Figure 7D) or ectopic
expression of Smad3EPSM (Figure 7E) markedly abolished
the resistance of MDA-MB231 cells to TβRI(T204D)induced p15INK4B expression. TGF-β1-induced p15INK4BLuc reporter gene expression was also significantly
enhanced by co-transfection with a plasmid expressing
Smad3EPSM or dominant-negative forms of p85α or NOX4
(Figure 7F), or by treatment with U75302, AG1478, or
U0126 (Figure 7G). Furthermore, FACS analysis revealed
that co-treatment of TGF-β1 with apocyanin (Figure
7H) or LY294002 (Figure 7I) substantially increased the
accumulation of MDA-MB231 cells in G1 phase compared
with TGF-β1 treatment alone.
To evaluate our in vitro findings on MDA-MB231
cell growth in vivo, we xenografted the following cell
types subcutaneously in the right flank of athymic nude
mice: MDA-MB231-shBLT1 cells that stably expressing
shRNA against human BLT1 and MDA-MB231-pLKO1
cells that stably expressing control vector. At a postmortem
examination conducted after 28 days, we observed that
tumors derived from MDA-MB231-shBLT1 cells grew at
a much slower rate than those from control MDA-MB231pLKO1 cells (Figure 8A). In addition, the MDA-MB231shBLT1 xenograft tumors showed the reduced levels
of BLT1 and NOX4 proteins and EGFR, Smad3Thr179,
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with those of
MDA-MB231-pLKO1 tumors (Figure 8B). Furthermore,
immunohistochemistry analysis on human breast tumor
tissue micro-array revealed that the protein levels of BLT1
and p-Smad3Thr179 were greater in tumor tissues compared
with those in normal tissues (Figures 9A and 9B). Kendall
tau rank correlation test showed the positive correlation
between BLT1 and p-Smad3Thr179 expression in the
human breast cancer tissues (Figure 9C). Collectively,
these data suggest that enhanced pSmad3L through BLT1NOX-ROS-EGFR-PI3K-ERK1/2-linked signaling cascade

cells to TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition.

progression, but limited information is available regarding
molecular mechanisms for its action in cancer. This study
demonstrated a new role for LTB4 as a negative regulator
at a key point of TGF-β1 signaling necessary for growth
inhibition, and revealed that blockade of BLT1 expression
sensitizes breast cancer cells to TGF-β1-induced growth
inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Results mechanistically
showed increased pSmad3L through BLT1/NOX4/ROS/
EGFR/PI3-K/ERK1/2-linked signaling cascade is crucial
for LTB4-mediated inhibition of TGF-β1-induced cell
cycle arrest at the G1 phase. This is the first report to show
inflammatory LTB4/BLT1 signal in control of cancer cell
proliferation through the inhibition of anti-proliferative
TGF-β1 activity. These findings thus provide a mechanism
that allows connection between inflammatory signal and
tumor growth.
Most of LTB4 signaling research in relation to
cancer progression has been focused on the role of BLT2.
The study by Kim H et al. showed that oncogenic Ras
promotes TGF-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition via a BLT2-linked signaling pathway in
mammary epithelial cells [36]. BLT2 has also been shown
to mediate lipopolysaccharide-potentiated invasiveness
and metastasis of breast cancer cells [37]. In this study, we
observed an inhibitory effects of BLT2 in TGF-β1-induced
cell cycle arrest and p15INK4B expression (data not shown).
However, since BLT2 was characterized to function as a
low affinity receptor, with broader ligand specificity for
various eicosanoids, including HETEs and HPETEs [38],
our study has focused on BLT1 with ligand specificity
for LTB4 only [39]. In mammary epithelial cells, LTB4
strongly inhibited TGF-β1-induced cell cycle arrest at the
G1 phase and this effect was dependent on BLT1 (Figure
1). Notably, FACS analysis showed that LTB4 by itself
does not significantly stimulate cell cycle progression
from G1 to S phase, suggesting that enhanced LTB4-BLT1
axis in cancer cells may facilitate proliferation by tipping
growth balance to cell cycle progression through inhibition
of TGF-β1 growth-inhibitory response.
Previous studies have established that Smad3 has a
key function in mediating the anti-proliferative TGF-β1
response [19, 20]. However, recent growing evidences
suggested that Smad3-phosphoisoforms have different
roles in TGF-β signaling; C-terminally phosphorylated
Smad3 transmits cytostatic TGF-β signal, whereas
pSmad3L is induced by oncogenes or mitogenic signals
and contributes to a shift from tumor suppressive to
oncogenic activity [40] In addition, increased pSmad3L
level has been frequently observed in several types of
pathological conditions such as chronic inflammation,
fibrosis, and cancer [41-43] In line with these reports,
our data showed that LTB4/BLT1 inflammatory signal
axis impairs TGF-β1-induced Smad3 transcriptional
activity by inducing pSmad3L without affecting its
canonical activation processes. Mutation of all four
sites in the Smad3 linker region can largely rescue the

DISCUSSION
Pro-inflammatory mediators released from tumor
and stromal cells in tumor microenvironment play critical
roles in fueling tumor development. Recently, growing
evidences have implicated LTB4, a proinflammatory
eicosanoid, in a number of processes linked to cancer

inhibition by LTB4/BLT1 axis of anti-proliferative TGF-β1
response. In MDA-MB231 xenografts, knockdown
of BLT1 significantly reduced the level of pSmad3L
at Thr179 concomitant with tumor growth inhibition.
Importantly, immunohistochemical staining of human
breast tumors has provided support for the relevance of
BLT1 overexpression and increased pSmad3L. Therefore,
our study suggests that Smad3 linker region can be an
important target of LTB4 inflammatory signal leading to
cancer cell proliferation.
A recent study by O’Leay et al. showed that TLR/
NOX1 redox signaling axis accelerate colon cancer cell
adhesion, thus increasing metastatic potential of the colon
cancer cells [44] Similarly, NOX1-derived ROS generation
had impact on TLR4 signaling to enhance tumor metastasis
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [45]. NOXderived ROS generation is also essential for activation
of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation
through tyrosine phosphatase oxidation and subsequently
sustained tyrosine kinase receptor phosphorylation [46].
Li et al. reported that reciprocal activation between IL-6/
STAT3 and NOX4/Akt signaling promotes proliferation
of NSCLC [47]. These evidences indicate an important
role of NOX enzyme in the pathogenesis of inflammationassociated tumor development. Nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-κB) has been shown as a major transcription factor
that regulates NOX4 gene expression [48, 49], and LTB4
activates NF-κB pathway [50]. Consistent with these
findings, our data showed that BLT1 increased NF-κBdependent reporter gene activity, and BLT1-induced
NOX4 expression was strongly inhibited by NF-κB
inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate hydrochloride
(Supplementary Figure S8). We demonstrated in this study
that enhanced NOX1 and NOX4 expression and ROS
production triggered by LTB4/BLT1 signal axis increases
the pSmad3L, contributing to the resistance to the TGF-β1
growth-inhibitory effects in cancer cells. Furthermore, our
study identified the EGFR-PI3K-ERK1/2-linked cascade
as a major signaling route connecting BLT1/NOX-derived
ROS generation and pSmad3L. These findings suggest a
novel functionality of NOX in the context of inhibition
of Smad3 tumor suppressive function through linker
phosphorylation level. Inhibition of NOX can contribute
to decreased levels of pSmad3L, and hence help restore
TGF-β1 growth-inhibitory response in cancer cells.
In summary, we showed that LTB4 can target
Smad3 linker region through a ‘BLT1-NOX-ROS-EGFRPI3K-ERK1/2’ signaling cascade. This contributes to
the resistant to the TGF-β1 growth-inhibitory effects,
thus increased proliferation of highly aggressive breast
cancer cells (Figure 9D). Therefore, the elucidation of
this mechanism provides an important insight into how
proinflammatory LTB4 promotes the proliferation of breast
cancer cells.

Animal experimental procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Kangwon National University. Female Balb/c nude
mice (4 weeks, 16 ~ 20 g) were purchased from Orient
Bio (Seongnam, Korea) and allowed to acclimatize for
1 week. Suspensions of 1 x 107 MDA-MB231-pLKO1
or MDA-MB231-shBLT1 stable cells in 0.2 ml of PBS
were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of mice
(n=5 per group). Tumor volumes were measured weekly
using a microcaliper for 4 weeks and calculated by
utilizing the following formula: TV (mm3)=L x (W)2/2,
where TV=tumor volume, L=length and W=with. On day
28, mice were euthanized according to the institutional
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, and
tumors were excised. Proteins and mRNAs extracted from
the xenografted tumors were subjected to immunoblot and
semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, respectively.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR

assay (20 µl final volume) was carried out for 30
min at 4 oC, with 10 µg of nuclear extracts, 30, 000
cpm of 32P-labelled probes, and 1 µg of poly(dI-dC)
[poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidic acid)] in 10 mM TrisCl, pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol. For
supershift assay, the extracts were incubated with 0.5 µg of
Smad3 antibody for 1 h at 4 oC and were loaded onto 4%
nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis,
gels were dried, exposed to imaging plates, and analyzed.
