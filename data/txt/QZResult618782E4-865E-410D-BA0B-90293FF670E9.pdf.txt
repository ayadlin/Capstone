ABSTRACT
Paclitaxel, a taxane, is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent that targets
microtubules. It has become a front-line therapy for a broad range of malignancies,
including lung, breast, gastric, esophageal, and bladder carcinomas. Although
paclitaxel can inhibit tumor development and improve survival, poor solubility,
myelotoxicity, allergic reactions, and drug resistance have restricted its clinical
application. Paclitaxel is frequently combined with other chemotherapeutics to
enhance the antitumor effects and reduce side effects. We synthesized geridonin,
a derivative of oridonin, and demonstrate that geridonin and paclitaxel act
synergistically to inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells. Importantly, geridonin
enhanced the antitumor effects of paclitaxel without increasing toxicity in vivo.
Mechanistic analysis revealed that administration of geridonin in combination with
paclitaxel up-regulated the tumor suppressor PTEN and inhibited phosphorylation
of Akt and MDM2. This led to the accumulation of p53 and induced apoptosis though
the mitochondrial pathway. Thus, geridonin in combination with paclitaxel is a new
treatment strategy for gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Oridonin is an ent-kaurene diterpenoid isolated
from Rabdosia rubescens. It displays broad antitumor
effects in various cancers including liver, breast, prostate,
esophagus, stomach, and leukemia, and exhibits low
toxicity to normal cells [9–12]. However, the clinical
applications of oridonin are limited due to poor water
solubility and unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic properties
[13, 14]. As a consequence, oridonin derivatives have
been synthesized, which are potential antineoplastic drugs
[15–17].
Apoptosis-targeted therapies are effective because
dysregulated cell death contributes to cancer development.
Apoptosis is typically induced through death receptors
(the extrinsic pathway) or the mitochondrial (intrinsic)
pathway to eliminate damaged cells and maintain
homeostasis [18]. In both pathways, active caspases 3
and 7 cleave poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in
response to DNA damage [19].

The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are some of
the most efficacious and broadly used chemotherapeutics
worldwide [1]. Paclitaxel inhibits microtubule
depolymerization, down-regulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
expression, and causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase
[2], thereby suppressing tumor growth [3]. Paclitaxel can
improve survival and sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy.
Therefore, it is a first-line chemotherapy for many types
of cancer including ovarian, breast, non-small cell lung,
and esophageal [4]. However, the clinical applications
of paclitaxel are limited due to side effects such as
gastrointestinal reactions, allergies [5], cardiotoxicity, and
drug resistance [6]. In order to improve the therapeutic
efficacy and delay drug resistance, combination
chemotherapies involving paclitaxel have been developed
[7], but enhanced toxicity has been observed [8].

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) including peroxides,
superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen, are vital
chemical messengers in cell signaling and homeostasis
[20]. They are produced as natural byproducts of normal
oxygen metabolism and are balanced by a scavenging
system. However, environmental stress (e.g. ultraviolet
radiation and imbalances in the oxygen scavenging system)
can contribute to an increase in ROS levels [20]. ROS
regulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in both
a direct and indirect manner. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
induces dimerization of Bax, which promotes translocation
of Bax from the cytoplasm to the outer mitochondrial
membrane. ROS can also indirectly mediate apoptosis
through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), and Akt pathways [21].
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling
pathway regulates numerous cellular processes including
cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis
[22, 23]. Active PI3K mediates phosphorylation of
Akt on Thr 308 in the catalytic domain and Ser 473 in
the regulatory domain, which leads to partial and full
activation of Akt, respectively [24]. Activated Akt controls
various biological responses. It can suppress apoptosis by
directly phosphorylating apoptotic signaling proteins or by
modulating the activity of transcription factors [25].
In this study, we synthesized geridonin (Figure 1A
and Supplementary Figure S1), a novel derivative of
oridonin, and determined that it synergistically enhanced
the anti-proliferation efficacy of paclitaxel against gastric
cancer MGC 803 cells via ROS-induced inactivation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway.

various concentrations of paclitaxel, either alone or
in combination with 10 μM geridonin, for 24 h. Low
doses of paclitaxel had a weak inhibitory effect on MGC
803 cell proliferation, while 10 μM geridonin significantly
enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of paclitaxel
(Figure 1C). We calculated the combination index (CI)
using the CompuSyn software and the Chou-Talalay
method, in which the combination index (CI) theorem
offers a quantitative definition for an additive (CI = 1),
synergistic (CI < 1), or antagonistic (CI > 1) effect of a
drug combination. The CI values for 10 μM geridonin
and paclitaxel (0.01–100 nM) were < 1, which was
suggestive of synergism between geridonin and paclitaxel
(Figure  1D). Therefore, we used 10 μM geridonin and
15 nM paclitaxel in all subsequent experiments.
Simultaneous treatment of MGC 803 cells with
10 μM geridonin and 15 nM paclitaxel for 24 h resulted
in significant alterations in cell morphology (Figure 2A).
Normal MGC 803 cells were spindle-shaped or polygonal
with a homogeneous size distribution. Geridonin and
paclitaxel treatment resulted in round-shaped cells. Cells
treated with both geridonin and paclitaxel exhibited
bubbling on the cell membrane (bright field). Normal
MGC 803 cells had round nuclei. In contrast, nuclei in the
treatment group had irregular shapes, were smaller, and in
some cases exhibited perforation. Multinucleate cells were
also observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. Since paclitaxel
targets microtubules, we assessed changes in microtubule
dynamics after treatment with geridonin and paclitaxel.
In the untreated group, filamentous microtubules were
clearly observed. In contrast, the majority of filamentous
microtubules disappeared in the treatment group. In
the geridonin and combination treatment groups, the
remaining microtubules tightly embraced the nucleus,
suggesting that geridonin and paclitaxel perturbed
microtubule organization in MGC 803 cells.
We next performed colony formation assays to
investigate the cytotoxicity of geridonin and paclitaxel
[27]. MGC 803 cells were treated with either geridonin
(10 μM), paclitaxel (15 nM), or geridonin plus paclitaxel
for 12 h. The drugs were then removed and the MGC
803 cells cultured for an additional 10 days before the
colonies were counted. Colony number and size decreased
after treatment with geridonin or paclitaxel compared to
the negative control (P < 0.01), and significantly fewer
colonies were observed in the geridonin plus paclitaxel
treatment group (P < 0.01 versus single-drug treatment)
(Figure 2B).

RESULTS
Geridonin synergistically enhances the
paclitaxel-mediated growth inhibition of MGC
803 gastric cancer cells
Rabdosia rubescens has been used in China for
the treatment of gastric and esophageal cancer [14]. We
first evaluated the cytotoxicity of oridonin and geridonin
(Figure 1A) on a series of human gastrointestinal cancer
cell lines including esophageal (KYSE-450-, EC109, and
EC109/Taxol [26]), colon (Colo205 and SW620), and
gastric (MGC 803 and SGC 7901). All of the cell lines
with the exception of SW620 showed higher sensitivity
to geridonin than to oridonin (Figure 1B). Geridonin
displayed a stronger growth-inhibitory effect against the
paclitaxel-resistant cell line EC109/Taxol (derived from
EC109) than against the parental cell line EC109. Both
geridonin and oridonin were cytotoxic to GES-1 human
gastric epithelial cells. The IC50 values of geridonin and
oridonin at 72 h are shown in Table 1.
To examine the combined effects of geridonin
and paclitaxel, MGC 803 cells were treated with

To analyze geridonin- and paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis, we assessed caspase activation by western
blotting. We found that 15 nM paclitaxel was not sufficient
for activation of the caspase cascade. Treatment of the
cells with 10 μM geridonin increased the levels of cleaved
caspase-9, -3, -7, and PARP1 (Figure 3B). Combination
treatment was more effective in activating caspase-9, -3,
-7, and PARP1 than either agent alone, suggesting that

Geridonin plus paclitaxel treatment resulted in a 42.7%
± 9.7% (P < 0.01 versus negative control; P < 0.01
versus each agent alone) loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential. These data indicate geridonin and paclitaxel act
synergistically to decrease the mitochondrial membrane
potential in MGC 803 cells.
Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins promote
apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway [30]. We found
that geridonin primarily promoted the expression of the
pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, while paclitaxel
treatment resulted in up-regulation of Bad (Figure 4B)

geridonin may enhance the apoptosis-inducing effect of
paclitaxel through the mitochondrial pathway.

in MGC 803 cells. Geridonin plus paclitaxel treatment
resulted in an increase in the levels of these pro-apoptotic
proteins compared to control cells (P < 0.01). Geridonin
and paclitaxel slightly altered the expression of Bcl-xL,
Mcl-1, and Bcl-2. However, geridonin plus paclitaxel
treatment reduced the levels of Bak and Bax (P < 0.01
versus negative control). In contrast, geridonin and
oridonin did not affect the expression of Fas, DR4,
DR5, or DcR1, which are all components of the death
receptor pathway (Supplementary Figure S2). Overall,
the data indicated that the synergetic effect of geridonin
and paclitaxel on apoptosis was induced through the
mitochondrial pathway through up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins and simultaneous down-regulation of
anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.

(Figure 5A) and flow cytometry (Figure 5B), respectively.
Treatment with 10 μM geridonin or 15 nM paclitaxel alone
resulted in only a slight increase in ROS levels (1.59- and
1.38-fold compared to the negative control) (Figure 5B).
Simultaneous treatment of MGC 803 cells with geridonin
and paclitaxel increased ROS levels by 3.08-fold compared
to the negative control (P < 0.01 versus the negative
control and each drug alone). We next examined the
effects of treating MGC 803 cells with the ROS scavenger
N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 2.5 mM) in combination with
geridonin, paclitaxel, or geridonin plus paclitaxel for 24 h.
NAC reduced the anti-proliferative effects of geridonin
(P < 0.01 versus the control), paclitaxel (P < 0.05), and
geridonin plus paclitaxel (P < 0.01), suggesting that ROS
may play a pivotal role in the synergism between geridonin
and paclitaxel (Figure 5C). We also confirmed that
geridonin and paclitaxel predominantly generated H2O2 in
MGC 803 cells (Figure 5D).

Geridonin and paclitaxel act synergistically
through the PI3K/Akt pathway to inhibit MGC
803 cell growth in a xenograft mouse model

inhibited Akt phosphorylation at both Thr 308 and Ser
473 (Figure 6). Geridonin plus paclitaxel treatment
enhanced phosphorylation at Ser 473, but not at Thr 308,
compared to treatment with either drug alone. Because Akt
phosphorylation can be blocked by the tumor suppressor
PTEN [31], we next measured PTEN expression.
Geridonin and paclitaxel up-regulated PTEN expression to
various extents, and combined treatment had a synergistic
effect on PTEN expression. MDM2 is an important Akt
substrate. Once phosphorylated by Akt, MDM2 can
target the tumor suppressor p53 for degradation through
ubiquitination. Phosphorylation of MDM2 at Ser 186 and
Ser 166 residues was suppressed by geridonin, paclitaxel,
and geridonin plus paclitaxel treatment, which resulted
in inactivation of MDM2. Geridonin and paclitaxel also
increased p53 expression, particularly when combined,
which could have contributed to the deactivation of
MDM2 (Figure 6). Akt also phosphorylates Bad at Ser
136 to block the antagonism between Bad and Bcl-2 or
Bad and Bcl-xL and promote cell survival. However, none
of the drugs altered phosphorylation of Bad at Ser 136
(Figure 6).

To analyze the synergism between geridonin and
paclitaxel in vivo, we generated human tumor xenografts
in nude mice. Both geridonin (20 mg/kg/d) and paclitaxel
(5 mg/kg/3d) reduced tumor volume (Figure 7B) and
weight (Figure 7C) compared to normal saline. After
treatment for 21 days, the growth inhibition rates of
geridonin and paclitaxel were 61.02% and 50.78%
respectively. Slower tumor growth was observed in
animals treated with geridonin plus paclitaxel compared
to those treated with either drug alone. At the end of
therapy, the inhibition rate of geridonin plus paclitaxel
was 83.56% (P < 0.01 versus single-agent treatment).
No obvious loss of body weight was observed in any of
the four treatment groups, suggesting the therapies were
well-tolerated (Figure 7A). Overall, the data indicated that
geridonin enhanced the antitumor effects of paclitaxel
without increasing toxicity. Additionally, we found that
geridonin and oridonin generated a surplus of H2O2 in the
tumor tissue (Figure 7E).

We next investigated the tumor-suppressive effects
of geridonin, paclitaxel, geridonin plus paclitaxel using
histological analysis and TUNEL assays. Hematoxylin and
eosin staining revealed a high density of tumor cell nuclei
in the normal saline-treated group that had a relatively
uniform, spherical morphology. Treatment with either
geridonin or paclitaxel alone resulted in the appearance
of condensed nuclei that displayed darker blue staining
compared to normal nuclei. The density of the nuclei also
decreased, which was indicative of apoptosis. Following
geridonin plus paclitaxel treatment, the majority of
the cells exhibited condensed nuclei and a reduction in
cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. These observations were
indicative of apoptosis and necrosis (Figure 7F, row 1).

We performed TUNEL assays to detect DNA
fragmentation, which results from apoptosis. Treatment
with either geridonin or paclitaxel alone resulted in an
increase in the green fluorescence signal in tumor tissues
compared to the negative control, which was indicative
of apoptosis (Figure 7F, rows 3 and 4). Treatment with
paclitaxel plus geridonin enhanced apoptosis compared to
either treatment alone.
To further investigate the mechanisms underlying
the synergistic anti-tumor effects of geridonin and
paclitaxel in vivo, we analyzed tumor tissue by western
blotting. Increased levels of PTEN and decreased
phosphorylation of Akt both at Ser 473 and Thr 308 were
observed in vivo, consistent with the synergist effects of

geridonin and paclitaxel observed in vitro. Deactivation
of Akt resulted in a reduction in phosphorylated MDM2 at
Ser 186 and Ser 166, and accumulation of p53 (Figure 8B).
As a consequence, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
were up-regulated, while anti-apoptotic members were
down-regulated. This resulted in activation of caspase-3,
-9, -7, and PARP1 by geridonin, paclitaxel, or geridonin
plus paclitaxel treatment (Figure 8A).

and microtubule dynamics (Figure 2A). In addition to
affecting microtubule dynamics, paclitaxel can induce
apoptosis through activation or suppression of proand anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members [36–38]. We
determined that geridonin enhanced paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis (Figure 3A). Geridonin in combination with
paclitaxel disrupted the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members resulting in destruction
of the mitochondrial membrane and apoptosis mediated by
the intrinsic pathway (Figure 4). Interestingly, geridonin
and paclitaxel also suppressed the growth of MGC 803
xenograft tumors in vivo. Moreover, combination therapy
was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than either
drug alone, and did not enhance the toxicity of paclitaxel.
Histological analysis revealed that paclitaxel induced
tumor cell apoptosis, which was enhanced by geridonin
(Figure 7).
Redundant ROS induce apoptosis through both
the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [39]. We therefore
examined the possibility that ROS induced apoptosis.
ROS levels (e.g., H2O2) were elevated after treatment
with either geridonin or paclitaxel alone, and combined
treatment resulted in overproduction of H2O2 both in vitro
and in vivo (Figure 5 and 7E).
Alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway have been
observed in many types of tumors [34]. This can promote
cell survival and proliferation [40–42]. PTEN negatively
regulates the Akt signaling pathway by dephosphorylating
PIP3 to generate PIP2. The PTEN gene is frequently
mutated in many different types of cancer [43, 44]. In this

DISCUSSION
To improve efficacy and reduce toxicity,
chemotherapeutic drugs or other gene- [32], proteinor natural product-based [33] therapeutic agents are
typically combined. In this study, we synthesized
geridonin, which is a derivative of oridonin that exhibits
enhanced cytotoxicity (Figure 1B). Geridonin enhanced
the inhibitory effect of low dose paclitaxel on MGC 803
gastric cancer cell growth (Figure 1C) with CI values < 1
(Figure 1D). These results demonstrated a synergistic
effect between geridonin and paclitaxel. A similar
synergistic effect on cell growth was observed in colony
formation assays (Figure 2B).
Paclitaxel targets β-tubulin to inhibit microtubule
dynamics, and causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M
phase [34, 35]. Treatment of MGC 803 cells with
paclitaxel resulted in alterations in cell morphology, the
disappearance of normal microtubules, and multinucleate
cells. Geridonin alone and in combination with
paclitaxel induced similar changes in cell morphology

study, we observed up-regulation of PTEN after treatment
with geridonin and paclitaxel alone, which was enhanced
by geridonin plus paclitaxel treatment. PTEN degraded
PIP3, which resulted in a decrease in Akt phosphorylation
at Ser 473 and Thr 308. Inactivation of Akt decreased
MDM2 phosphorylation, inhibited nuclear translocation,
abolished MDM2-induced degradation of p53, and
ultimately led to increased p53 expression and inhibition
of tumor progression (Figure 8).
In summary, we have demonstrated that geridonin
and paclitaxel act synergistically to suppress the growth
of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo through
ROS-mediated PTEN activation and deactivation of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, geridonin in
combination with paclitaxel may serve as a promising
strategy for gastric cancer treatment.

Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assays [45].
The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 4,000
cells per well and then treated with geridonin, paclitaxel, or
oridonin. After treatment with the indicated drugs, 20 μL
of MTT was added to each well at a final concentration of
500 μg/mL. The plates were then incubated for 4 h at 37°C.
The supernatant was removed after staining and 150 μL of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) added to each well. The plates
were vigorously shaken and the absorbance measured at
570 nm. The percent cytotoxicity was calculated using
the following formula: % cytotoxicity = [1 – (absorbance
of the experimental well - absorbance of the blank)/
(absorbance of the untreated control well - absorbance of
the blank)] × 100. Drug interactions were analyzed using
the median effect principle (Talalay-Chou method). The
CI was calculated using the CompuSyn software, where
a CI = 1 was indicative of an additive effect, a CI < 1 was
indicative of a synergistic effect, and a CI > 1 was indicated
of an antagonistic effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Colony formation assays
A total of 1,000 MGC 803 cells per well were
seeded in 6-well plates and treated with geridonin,
paclitaxel, or geridonin plus paclitaxel for 12 h. Following
the incubation, the medium was replaced and the cells
cultured for an additional 10 days. Colonies were fixed
with methanol, stained with crystal violet (Beyotime
Biotechnology), and counted in ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health) [27, 46].

Apoptosis assays
Apoptosis was analyzed using the Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, Nanjing,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, MGC 803 cells were washed twice with cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in
500 μL binding buffer containing 5 μL Annexin V-FITC
staining solution. The cells were incubated in the dark for
20 min, and then 5 μL PI staining solution was added to the
cell suspension. After 5 min, apoptosis was detected using
a BD AccuriTM C6 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The data were analyzed with
the CFlow Plus software (Becton Dickinson).

Cell culture
All cell lines were purchased from the Cell Bank
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
The MGC 803 cell line was authenticated by GENEWIZ
Inc. (Suzhou, China). Colo205 and SW620 cells were
cultured in DMEM (Solarbio, Beijing, China), and all
other cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Solarbio,
Beijing, China). Media was supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit

for 24 h. The cells were then treated with geridonin,
paclitaxel, or geridonin plus paclitaxel for 24 h.
Following the incubation, the cells were fixed with 4%
(v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature
and then washed three times with PBS (5 min/wash).
Next, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton
X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. After washing, the
coverslips were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated
with an α-tubulin primary antibody at 4°C overnight.
After washing, coverslips were incubated with an Alexa
Fluor® 488 Rabbit Anti-Goat IgG (H+L) for 1 h at room
temperature. The cells were then washed and stained with
Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/mL, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing,
China) for 10 min. Images were collected using a laser
scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, FV10i, Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

fluorescence. The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst
33342 (5 μg/mL).

In vivo assays of antitumor activity
All animal experiments were approved by the
Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University. Six-weekold male BALB/c nude mice (Silikejingda, Hunan,
China) were housed in individually ventilated cages and
maintained with food and sterile water. After approximately
1  week of acclimatization, MGC 803 cells (1.0 × 107)
were resuspended in 0.2 mL of saline and inoculated
subcutaneously into the right forelimb of each mouse.
When the tumor volume reached 100–150 mm3, the animals
were randomized to the following treatment groups: NS
(normal saline, 0.2 mL/kg/day, intravenous injection),
paclitaxel (5 mg/kg/3 day, intravenous injection), geridonin
(20 mg/kg/day, intravenous injection), and geridonin plus
paclitaxel. Tumor length, width, and animal body weight
were measured every 2 days. Tumor volume was calculated
using the following formula: tumor volume (mm3) = length
× width × width/2. Animals were sacrificed at the end of
the experiment using the cervical dislocation method, and
the tumors were excised and weighed. Tumors were stored
at −80°C for later use in western blotting. Tumor samples
were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin for histological analysis.

Mitochondrial membrane potential assays
The mitochondrial membrane potential was
measured using JC-1 dye [45, 47]. MGC 803 cells were
seeded on glass coverslips and treated with geridonin,
paclitaxel, or geridonin plus paclitaxel for 24 h. MGC
803 cells were then stained with 5 μg/mL JC-1 (Beyotime
Biotechnology) at 37°C for 20 min. Following the
incubation, the cells were rinsed and the JC-1 signal
visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Nikon,
A1, Tokyo, Japan). Monomers and J-aggregates were
excited simultaneously with a 488 nm wavelength laser
(green), while J-aggregates were excited using a 561 nm
wavelength laser (red). Quantitative analysis (the relative
ratio of red/green fluorescence) was performed using the
NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon).

Western blotting
Cells or tumor tissue samples were lysed on ice
for 30 min in RIPA buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology)
containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Biotool, Houston, TX, USA). The
lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at
4°C. The total protein concentrations were estimated
using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Solarbio Life Sciences,
Beijing, China). Identical amounts of cell lysates were
boiled for 10 min and then separated by SDS-PAGE. After
electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5%
non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20
(TBST) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated
with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The membranes
were washed three times with TBST and then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Zhongshan Golden Bridge, Beijing, China)
for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then
washed three times with TBST and immunoreactive bands
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
reagent (Pierce Fast Western Blot Kit, Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The relative expression ratios for the experimental
and control groups were calculated based on density using
the ImageJ software and the GAPDH signal as a reference.

ROS and H2O2 assays
ROS levels were probed using dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and detected by flow
cytometry (BD Biosciences) and fluorescence microscopy
(Nikon). H2O2 were measured using a Hydrogen Peroxide
Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) [48] according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. After treatment for 12 h,
5 × 107 cells were collected and lysed to measure H2O2
levels in vitro. Tumor tissue samples (20 mg) were lysed
to measure H2O2 levels in vivo.

Histological analysis and TUNEL assays
We prepared 5 μm tissue sections from paraffinembedded tumor tissue samples. The sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis.
TUNEL assays of apoptosis were performed using the
TUNEL Staining Kit (FITC dye; KeyGen Biotech,
Nanjing, China). Apoptosis was visualized as green
