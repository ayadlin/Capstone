Abstract
Curcumin induces cancer cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vitro, but its poor bioavailability in vivo limits
its antitumor efficacy. We have previously evaluated the bioavailability of novel analogues of curcumin compared with curcumin, and we found that the analogue CDF exhibited greater systemic and pancreatic tissue
bioavailability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of CDF or curcumin alone or in combination with gemcitabine on cell viability and apoptosis in gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer
(PC) cell lines. Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant reduction in cell viability in CDF-treated cells
compared with curcumin-treated cells, which were also associated with the induction of apoptosis, and these
results were consistent with the downregulation of Akt, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and NF-κB DNA binding activity. We have also documented attenuated expression of
miR-200 and increased expression of miR-21 (a signature of tumor aggressiveness) in gemcitabine-resistant
cells relative to gemcitabine-sensitive cells. Interestingly, CDF treatment upregulated miR-200 expression
and downregulated the expression of miR-21, and the downregulation of miR-21 resulted in the induction
of PTEN. These results prompt further interest in CDF as a drug modality to improve treatment outcome
of patients diagnosed with PC as a result of its greater bioavailability in pancreatic tissue. Cancer Res; 70(9);

Introduction
Although significant progress has been made in systemic
treatments, pancreatic cancer (PC) still remains the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States
with an estimated 42,470 new cases and 35,240 deaths in
2009 (1). Many attempts in recent years aimed at improving
the survival of patients diagnosed with PC have been disappointing, suggesting that newer treatment strategies must
be developed.
Gemcitabine is considered the standard agent for the
treatment of advanced disease and has offered some relief
over the past two decades; however, the combination treatment using gemcitabine with other agents has not been successful in increasing the overall survival. These disappointing
results call for novel combination therapies to improve the

survival outcome of PC patients. Emerging evidence has
shown combination therapies involving treatment with curcumin, an active component of turmeric, with gemcitabine in
PC cell lines (2–4). Curcumin in combination with celecoxib,
a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, showed significant
growth inhibition of PC cell lines (5) and, interestingly, in
combination with ω-3 fatty acids showed synergistic tumor
inhibitory properties (6). These results suggest that curcumin
could be useful in combination therapy, especially because
curcumin is nontoxic to humans and showed multitargeted
effects (7). Furthermore, curcumin alone can alter the expression of microRNAs (miRNA) in PC cells (8), which could be
important in mediating its biological effects. Although curcumin could inhibit cell viability; induces apoptosis in pancreatic, breast, lung, prostate, and several other cancer cell lines
(7, 9–11); and is also well tolerated, its limited absorbance
across the gut and rapid metabolism in animal models and
human clinical trials raised major concern regarding its target tissue bioavailability, limiting its therapeutic value
(12, 13) especially for the treatment of patients with pancreatic tumor. Numerous analogues of curcumin have been created to overcome its low bioavailability and have attempted
to increase its absorption without loss of activity (14–17);
however, none has shown better target tissue bioavailability
especially in the pancreas. We have previously shown the
synthesis of a new analogue (CDF) with potent biological activity against PC cells and have also documented significantly

CDF, Curcumin, and Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer

greater pancreatic tissue bioavailability in mice compared
with curcumin (18, 19), which led us to conduct the current
study.
Studies have shown that the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is due to the aberrant
expression of PTEN in PC cell lines (20, 21). Phosphorylation
and activation of PI3K/Akt can activate NF-κB, and the development and progression of PC are linked with the activation of NF-κB, a key transcriptional regulator of genes
involved in cell survival, proliferation, and induction of apoptosis, thus suggesting that targeting inactivation of NF-κB
could be therapeutically important (22, 23). Moreover, COX-2,
a transcriptional downstream target of NF-κB, which mediates the production of prostaglandins [prostaglandin E 2
(PGE2)] could also be a potential target for the treatment
of PC (24). Interestingly, we have shown that curcumin
and its analogue CDF could target both NF-κB and COX-2
(19), suggesting that CDF could be useful for the treatment
of PC, especially because of its greater pancreatic tissue
bioavailability.
Emerging evidence has shown that gene expression
could be regulated by miRNAs, suggesting that miRNAs
may play important functional role in a wide array of physiologic cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (25). It has also been suggested that
the processes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
are regulated by the expression status of specific miRNAs
during tumor development and progression (26, 27). The
miRNA-200 family is one such example, which plays important role in regulation of EMT (28, 29), and is associated
with cancer recurrence and overall survival. Low expression
of miRNA-200 plays important roles in cancer metastasis in
ovarian (30) and breast cancer (31). Hence reactivation of
miR-200 by novel approaches could serve as inhibitors of
EMT, which may either kill or reverse the EMT phenotype,
thereby conventional agent, such as gemcitabine, could
effectively kill those EMT-type cells. Another miRNA,
miR-21, is overexpressed in solid tumors, including PC
(32–34), breast cancer (35), and thyroid cancer (36), compared with paired benign and normal tissues. Induction of
Stat-3 by interleukin-6 has been linked to miR-21 in multiple myeloma cells (37), and miR-21 is considered an oncogenic miRNA exhibiting antiapoptotic activity in various
carcinomas cell lines (38, 39), suggesting that the inactivation of miR-21 could be therapeutically beneficial toward
the treatment of PC.
Here we report for the first time that CDF, a novel analogue
of curcumin, upregulated miRNA-200b and miRNA-200c
and downregulated miR-21 in both gemcitabine-sensitive
(BxPC-3) and gemcitabine-resistant (MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M) cell lines, which were associated with induction
of apoptosis. We also showed that combination of CDF
with gemcitabine was much more effective than either
agent alone compared with curcumin, suggesting that
CDF-mediated alterations in specific miRNAs, along with
inactivation of NF-κB and its downstream genes, could
be a novel approach for the treatment of patients diagnosed with PC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, drugs, and reagents. Human PC cell lines
MIAPaCa-E, MIAPaCa-M, and BxPC-3 were chosen for this
study based on their sensitivities to gemcitabine. MIAPaCa
cells were exposed to gemcitabine every other week for
4 months to create a gemcitabine-resistant cell line. We
named this paired cell line as MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M
based on the changes in morphology from epithelial-like to
mesenchymal-like phenotype. The cell lines have been tested
and authenticated in core facility Applied Genomics Technology Center at Wayne State University on March 13,
2009. The method used for testing was short tandem repeat
profiling using the PowerPlex 16 System from Promega.
Gemcitabine and curcumin were purchased from Eli Lilly
and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. CDF was synthesized as
described in our earlier publication (18, 19).
Cell viability assay. To test the viability of cells, 3,000 cells
per well were plated in a 96-well plate for 24 hours. We initially tested a range of concentrations for CDF/curcumin
(0.1–4 μmol/L) and gemcitabine (10–50 nmol/L). Based on
the initial results for BxPC-3 cells, we chose the concentration
of CDF/curcumin (1 μmol/L) and gemcitabine (10 nmol/L) for
all subsequent assays. Next, we tested the effect of treatments
on MIAPaCa-E (relatively resistant to gemcitabine) and
MIAPaCa-M (highly resistant to gemcitabine) cell line with
higher doses of CDF/curcumin (4 or 10 μmol/L), gemcitabine
(10 nmol/L), and their combinations. Standard assay using
MTT was performed after treatment for 72 hours, and experiments were repeated thrice. The color intensity was measured
by TECAN's microplate fluorometer (TECAN) at 595 nm.
Clonogenic assay. MIAPaCa-E cells were plated (50,000 per
well) in a six-well plate. After 72 hours of exposure to 4 μmol/L
of CDF/curcumin, 10 nmol/L of gemcitabine, and the combination, cells were trypsinized, and 1,000 viable cells were plated in
100-mm Petri dishes. The cells were then incubated for ∼10 to
12 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 incubator. Colonies
were stained with 2% crystal violet and quantitated.
Quantification of apoptosis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Roche Applied Science)
was used to detect apoptosis in untreated and treated cells.
Cells seeded in six-well plates were treated with CDF/curcumin (1, 4, or 10 μmol/L), gemcitabine (10 nmol/L), or their
combination and trypsinized, and ∼10,000 cells were assayed
as described earlier (40). TECAN's microplate fluorometer
(TECAN) was used to measure color intensity at 405 nm.
The experiment was repeated thrice.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. BxPC-3,
MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M cells treated with CDF/curcumin
(1 or 4 μmol/L), gemcitabine (10 nmol/L), or the combination
for 72 hours were used to evaluate the effects on COX-2,
E-cadherin, PTEN, pAkt, tropomyosin, and β-actin expression. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (40), and the signal intensity was measured using
chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce).
PTEN cDNA transfection. To determine the effect of PTEN
cDNA transfection, MIAPaCa-E cells were plated in 100-mm

Petri dishes overnight and transfected with 15 μg of PTEN
cDNA or the control empty vector by ExGen 500 (Fermentas)
following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated
with gemcitabine (10 nmol/L) or left untreated for 48 hours
and assessed for the expression of PTEN, pAkt, NF-κB, and
β-actin by Western blot analysis.
Antisense miR-21 oligonucleotide transfection. MIAPaCa-E
cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes overnight. Cells
were transfected with antisense miR-21 oligonucleotide or
the nonspecific control using ExGen 500 (Fermentas) following the manufacture's protocol. Treatment with 10 nmol/L
of gemcitabine was done for 48 hours, and transfection efficiency of targeted proteins PTEN, pAkt, and NF-κB was determined by Western blot analysis.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for NF-κB activation.
To evaluate the effect of CDF, curcumin, and gemcitabine on
BxPC-3, MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M cells, the cells were either
untreated or treated with CDF/curcumin (1 or 4 μmol/L),
gemcitabine (10 nmol/L), or the combination for 72 hours.
The cells were lysed in 400 μL of lysis buffer, and the reaction
was set up as described earlier (40). The gel was scanned using
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Inc.). Equal protein
loading was ensured by immunoblotting 10 μg of nuclear
protein and probing with antiretinoblastoma antibody.
Determination of PGE2. To determine PGE2 levels, BxPC-3,
MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M cells were treated with CDF/
curcumin (1–4 μmol/L), gemcitabine (10 nmol/L), or the combination for 24 hours in serum-free media. PGE2 secreted in
the culture medium was analyzed using PGE2 immunoassay
kit, as suggested by the manufacturer (R&D Systems).
Determination of vascular endothelial growth factor.
All three human PC cells were seeded in six-well plates overnight followed by treatment with CDF/curcumin (1–4 μmol/L),
gemcitabine (10 nmol/L), or their combination for 72 hours.
The supernatant was assayed for vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) assay using AlphaLISA VEGF 500 data point
kit from Perkin-Elmer.
TaqMan miRNA real-time reverse transcription–PCR.
To determine the expression of miRNAs (miRNA-200a,
miR-200b, and miR-21) in all three PC cell lines, we used TaqMan miRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystems) following manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with CDF/curcumin
(1–4 μmol/L), gemcitabine (10 nmol/L), or combination for
72 hours. Total RNA was extracted, and 5 ng from each sample
were reverse transcribed as described earlier (29). Real-time
PCR reactions were then carried out in a total volume of
25 μL reaction mixture as described earlier (29) using Smart
Cycler II (Cepheid). Data were analyzed using Ct method
and were normalized by RNU6B expression in each sample.
Statistical methods. Comparisons of treatment outcome
were tested for statistical difference by the paired t test. Statistical significance was assumed at a P value of <0.05.

Results
The effects of CDF, curcumin, and gemcitabine on the
viability of human PC cell lines, as assessed by MTT and
clonogenic assays. BxPC-3 cells treated with different

3608

Cancer Res; 70(9) May 1, 2010

concentrations of CDF/curcumin (0.1–4 μmol/L) for 72 hours
(Fig. 1A) were assessed for cell growth, as determined by
MTT assay. Significant reduction in cell viability was seen
in cells treated with CDF and curcumin. Based on our initial
results, we selected the concentration of CDF/curcumin as
(1 μmol/L) and gemcitabine (10 nmol/L) for BxPC-3 cells
for conducting the combination experiments (Fig. 1B). Significant inhibition of cell viability was seen in combination
treatments in BxPC-3 cells. MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M cells
when treated with higher concentration of either 4 μmol/L or
10 μmol/L CDF/curcumin showed greater inhibition with
CDF alone than curcumin alone; however, the growth inhibition was more superior in CDF combinations than curcumin
combinations (Fig. 1B and C). The effect of treatment on cell
growth was also assessed by clonogenic assay. The combination treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of colony
formation in MIAPaCa-E cells when compared with singleagent treatment (Fig. 1D), and this was much more pronounced by CDF compared with curcumin combination.
Similar results were observed with other cell lines (data not
shown). Based on differential sensitivities of these cell lines
to the above-mentioned agents, we chose different concentrations of CDF/curcumin for BxPC-3 (1 μmol/L), MIAPaCa-E
(4 μmol/L), and MIAPaCa-M (4 μmol/L) for all subsequent
experiments.
Light micrographic pictures. Figure 2A shows the morphologic differences in BxPC-3, MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M
cells. The MIAPaCa-E cells were exposed to gemcitabine every other week for a period of 4 months, which led to this
mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 2A). These cells (MIAPaCa-M)
were subsequently used for our experiments.
Induction of apoptosis by CDF, curcumin, gemcitabine,
and the combination. The underlying mechanism on the inhibition of cell viability was further studied by determining
the apoptotic effects using the cell death detection ELISA.
The combination of CDF and gemcitabine resulted in a significant induction of apoptosis in all three cell lines tested
when compared with curcumin combination or single agents
alone (Fig. 2B). We also wanted to test whether increasing the
concentration of CDF and curcumin from 4 to 10 μmol/L in
MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M would have any differential
effects. We observed a substantial induction of apoptosis
in cells treated with both combinations (Fig. 2C). These
results are consistent with the cell viability assay. Subsequently, the mechanisms of such differences were further
investigated, and the results are presented in the following
sections.
Treatment effects on the expression of selective proteins.
BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-E, and MiaPaCa-M cells were used to evaluate the effects of CDF, curcumin, and/or gemcitabine on the
expression of COX-2, E-cadherin, PTEN, pAkt, and tropomyosin. Cells were treated with CDF/curcumin (1 or 4 μmol/L)
and/or gemcitabine (10 nmol/L) for 72 hours. There was
a complete loss of basal level of expression of COX-2 in
MiaPaCa-M cells exposed to gemcitabine for a period of
∼4 months. Expression of COX-2, pAkt, and tropomyosin
proteins were significantly reduced in cells treated with
CDF and its combination when compared with curcumin

and its combination (Fig. 3A). Epithelial marker E-cadherin expression was significantly enhanced with CDF, curcumin, or

was observed in MiaPaCa-E and MiaPaCa-M cells due to lack

treatment combinations. These results suggest that CDF is
much more effective than curcumin. Because PTEN is a known
target of miR-21, which has been reported to be upregulated in
PC (32, 41, 42), we assessed the expression levels of miR-21 and

assessed its interrelationship with the expression of PTEN in
PC cells.

of miR-21, which is an oncogenic miRNA and showed to have
antiapoptotic activity in various carcinomas cell lines (38,
39), between BxPC-3 (gemcitabine-sensitive), MIAPaCa-E
(relatively resistant to gemcitabine), and MIAPaCa-M (highly
resistant to gemcitabine) cells by real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). Overexpression of miR-21 was observed
in both MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M cells compared with
BxPC-3 cells. In addition, we found a significant reduction
in the expression of miR-21 in cells treated with either
CDF alone or in combination with gemcitabine (Fig. 3B).
To further validate whether miR-21 indeed could target the
expression levels of a tumor suppressor PTEN, we investigated the effect of transfection of PTEN cDNA and miR-21
antisense oligonucleotide in MIAPaCa-E cells.
Effects of PTEN cDNA transfection and miR-21 antisense
oligonucleotide transfection on selective proteins. MIAPaCa-E cells showed increased expression of miR-21, and thus,
this cell line was used to evaluate the effect of both PTEN
cDNA and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide transfection on
the expression of PTEN, pAkt, and NF-κB. The cells were
transfected with either PTEN cDNA or miR-21 antisense
oligonucleotide for 48 hours followed by gemcitabine treatment for 48 hours. The expression of PTEN was enhanced
by both transfection studies compared with either untreated
cells or cells treated with control vector or oligos, respectively. On the other hand, the expression of pAkt and NF-κB
was further reduced with both the transfection (Fig. 3C and D).
These findings clearly suggest that CDF and curcumin are
capable of reactivating the expression of PTEN, which is normally lost in malignant tumors, and this is mediated by
downregulating the expression of miR-21. To gain mechanistic insight on how CDF and curcumin could sensitize PC cell
lines to gemcitabine-induced inhibition of cell viability and
induction of apoptosis, we investigated the DNA binding
activity of NF-κB and assessed the effects of treatments on
NF-κB downstream gene, such as COX-2.
CDF and curcumin inhibits NF-κB DNA binding activity.
The DNA binding activity of NF-κB, a nuclear transcription
factor, was assessed in all three PC cell lines treated with
CDF, curcumin, gemcitabine, and the combination treatment. Gemcitabine-treated cells caused activation of NF-κB
in all three cell lines, whereas CDF-treated cells caused significant inhibition in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in all
three cell lines. Interestingly, gemcitabine-induced activation
of NF-κB was attenuated by CDF treatment (Fig. 4). However,
the curcumin-treated cells or its combination with gemcitabine showed much lower effects on NF-κB DNA binding activity compared with CDF-treated cells (Fig. 4). These results
suggest that the combination of CDF and gemcitabine causes
greater inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis,
inhibition of COX-2 protein, and all of which could in
part be due to inactivation of NF-κB in both gemcitabineresistant and gemcitabine-sensitive cell lines. Because we
found that CDF could inhibit COX-2, we assessed the
COX-2 enzymatic product PGE2 in the conditioned medium
under our experimental conditions.
Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis. Because it is known that the
inhibition of COX-2 will reduce the synthesis of PGE2, we

3612

Cancer Res; 70(9) May 1, 2010

have tested the effects of treatments on the production of
PGE2. We measured the levels of PGE2 in the conditioned medium collected from BxPC-3, MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M
cells after treatments. It is important to note that we found
a higher level of PGE2 secretion by BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 5A),
whereas MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M cells showed very low
basal levels of secreted PGE2, which are consistent with low
constitutive expression of COX-2 protein (43). There was a
substantial increase in the PGE2 level in gemcitabine-treated
BxPC-3 cells compared with untreated cells, suggesting that
gemcitabine-induced NF-κB could be responsible for the induction of COX-2 and thereby caused induction in the secretion of PGE 2 . A significant reduction in PGE 2 level was
observed in cells treated with CDF, curcumin, or their combinations with gemcitabine; however, the effect was much more
pronounced in cells treated with CDF than curcumin. Collectively, these results suggest that the production of PGE2 is mediated through NF-κB and COX-2 pathway and that CDF could
downregulate both NF-κB and COX-2 and thereby reduces the
synthesis and secretion of PGE2.
Inhibition of VEGF secretion. We have shown that CDF
and curcumin attenuated gemcitabine-induced activation
of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in the previous section;
thus, we investigated the effect of CDF, curcumin, gemcitabine, or their combination on another downstream transcriptional target of NF-κB, i.e., VEGF secretion by BxPC-3,
MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M cells. Conditioned media from
cells treated with CDF, curcumin, gemcitabine, or their combination were analyzed using AlphaLISA VEGF 500 data
point kit from Perkin-Elmer. Compared with untreated
cells and cells treated with curcumin, both MIAPaCa-E
and MIAPaCa-M cells treated with CDF showed a significant inhibition in the secreted levels of VEGF (Fig. 5B).
Because previous studies have shown that the loss of
miR-200 family is associated with drug-resistant phenotype
especially in those cells having mesenchymal phenotype
(29), we assessed the level of expression of miR-200 in
PC cells under our experimental conditions to gain further
mechanistic insight as to the biological effects of CDF.
Modulation of miR-200b and miR-200c expression in
BxPC-3, MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M cells. We determined the comparative level of expression of miRNA-200

gemcitabine-resistant MIAPaCa-E (relatively resistant to
gemcitabine) and MIAPaCa-M (highly resistant to gemcitabine) by real-time RT-PCR. The miR-200b and miR-200c,
which are known regulators of EMT, were significantly decreased in both MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M compared
with BxPC-3 cells, which are also consistent with their
differential sensitivities to gemcitabine (Fig. 6A). BxPC-3,
MIAPaCa-E, and MIAPaCa-M cells treated with CDF, curcumin, or gemcitabine and their combination for 72 hours
showed increased expression of miR-200b and miR-200c,
but the effect was much more pronounced in CDF-treated
cells (Fig. 6B and C), suggesting the superiority of CDF
compared with curcumin.

reversed by CDF treatment and, as such, will render these
cells to gemcitabine chemosensitivity, which of course needs
further in-depth investigation.

Discussion
Here, we have shown that a synthetic analogue of curcumin, CDF, is significantly more effective in the killing of gemcitabine-resistant cells, which could in part be due to better
cellular uptake and retention of CDF by PC cells, which is
consistent with our published findings on pharmacokinetic
data in mice (18, 19). Mechanistically, this could be due to
inactivation of NF-κB and COX-2 as predicted previously
(19). Because the expression and activation of COX-2 and
NF-κB pathways is common in PC cells and contributes to
the observed resistance of PC cells to chemotherapeutic
agents (44), a rational approach for the successful inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

of cell growth would be to combine natural agents that are
nontoxic but could be highly effective in the inhibition of
NF-κB and COX-2. To that end, curcumin, a natural dietary
chemopreventive agent, has shown multitargeted effects, including the inhibition of NF-κB and COX-2, and thus, curcumin when combined with gemcitabine could be very effective
in vitro, but its limited absorbance across the gut in humans
limits its therapeutic utilities. In our study, we have found
that our novel synthetic analogue (CDF) of curcumin is much
more effective in inhibiting NF-κB, COX-2, PGE2, and VEGF
either alone or when combined with gemcitabine. The COX-2
generated PGE2 plays important roles during pancreatic tumorigenesis, and our data clearly suggest that CDF alone or
in combination with gemcitabine could inhibit the production of PGE2. These results are also due to CDF-mediated
inactivation of NF-κB, which in turn inactivates the transcription of COX-2 and thereby leads to the inhibition in
the production of PGE2. These results suggest that the combinatorial approach led to the discovery of our novel agent

CDF, which could be useful for the prevention of tumor progression and/or treatment of PC.
Here, we also report for the first time that both CDF and
curcumin are effective in reducing specific miRNAs. miRNAs
are moderately stable compared with large molecules, such
as proteins, and can be efficiently extracted because they
are well preserved in both formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded tissues (45). miRNAs can also normalize multiple
coding genes associated with tumor growth, and thus, assessment of specific miRNA expression could be useful for
predicting disease outcome. It is well known that the develop-

ment of cancer involves alterations in the expression of multiple genes regulated by transcriptional, posttranscription,
translational, and posttranslational modification, and thus,
a single gene or protein expression cannot accurately reflect
the status of the disease. miR-21 is overexpressed in many
solid tumors and has been shown to be associated with
tumor progression, poor survival, and reduced therapeutic
effects (25, 38, 46). In fact we have reviewed the role of
miRNAs in cancer (41), which is consistent with another
review article recently published (42). Here, we found that
miR-21 expression is upregulated in gemcitabine-resistant

for 24 h. Please note that the basal
level of PGE2 in BxPC-3 cells was
10 times higher than MIAPaCa-E
and MIAPaCa-M cells.

CDF, Curcumin, and Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer

cell lines (MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M) compared with
gemcitabine-sensitive BxPC-3 cells and that the expression
of miR-21 could be significantly downregulated by CDF and
its combination with gemcitabine. There are several genes
that are regulated by miR-21, and the increased expression
of miR-21 could downregulate specific genes among such
genes. PTEN, a well known tumor suppressor gene, has
been reported to be lost in tumors and is regulated by
miR-21 (32, 41, 42), which is consistent with our findings
showing the reactivation of PTEN in PC cells treated with
CDF or curcumin. Consistent with our results, it was shown
that inactivation of miR-21 by treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotide of miR-21 increased PTEN protein expression and induced cell cycle arrest in human PC cells
(47). The implication or the effect of our data would be
enormous because natural nontoxic agents or their synthetic analogues could be useful for the upregulation of
PTEN mediated via inactivation of miR-21, and our data
further suggest that such strategy could in fact be useful
for sensitization of drug-resistant PC cells to conventional

www.aacrjournals.org

cytotoxic agents that are not very effective by themselves,
such as gemcitabine. The activation of PTEN by CDF or
curcumin would decrease Akt phosphorylation as shown
in Fig. 3, which would likely contribute to the inhibition
of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and such effects
could be exploited in a preclinical animal model in future
studies.
The data presented on miR-21 inactivation is in sharp contrast to the data on miR-200b and miR-200c, whose expression was drastically reduced in gemcitabine-resistant PC
cells, which is consistent with previous findings showing
that the expression of these miRNAs was either lost or substantially reduced in various tumors, including pancreas
(29). Interestingly, we found that that the expression of
miR-200b and miR-200c could be upregulated by CDF and
curcumin, suggesting that the mesenchymal phenotype of
gemcitabine-resistant PC cells could be reversed by simply
treating the cells with either CDF or curcumin. We found that
both MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M cells showed lower expression of both miR-200b and miR-200c and loss of E-cadherin

expression, consistent with mesenchymal-like morphology
(Fig. 2A) compared with BxPC-3 cells having epithelial
morphology and higher expression of both miR-200b and
miR-200c and E-cadherin. Our results also showed that the
treatment of MIAPaCa-E and MIAPaCa-M cells with CDF
alone or in combination with gemcitabine significantly upregulated miR-200 expression, although the expression of Ecadherin was not upregulated, suggesting that only partial
reversal of the EMT could be achieved, which will lead to
sensitization of gemcitabine-resistant cells to gemcitabineinduced killing.
In conclusion, our results suggest that CDF could sensitize
PC cells to gemcitabine by inactivation of NF-κB, COX-2,
and their downstream target molecules, which is in part
due to inactivation of miR-21 and reactivation of miR-200b
and miR-200c. The inactivation of miR-21 led to the reactivation of PTEN, resulting in the inactivation of phosphorylated
Akt. In addition, CDF was able to cause reactivation of
miR-200b and miR-200c, which may in turn result in the reversal of EMT phenotype and thus, sensitizing gemcitabineresistant PC cells to gemcitabine again, could be exploited

for designing novel strategies for the prevention of tumor
progression and/or treatment of pancreatic tumors using
the combination of CDF and gemcitabine in the immediate
future.
