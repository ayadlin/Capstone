BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a widely used staging method for patients with early breast
cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy modifies the anatomical conditions in the breast and axilla, and thus SLNB
remains controversial in patients treated preoperatively. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the reliability and
accuracy of this procedure in this particular group of patients. METHODS: The retrospective study analyzed medical
records of patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer between the years 2005 and 2009. Of the patients treated
by neoadjuvant therapy, 343 underwent lymphatic mapping to identify sentinel lymph nodes, and these were
included in the analysis. RESULTS: The overall detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes was 80.8%. It was strongly influenced by clinical lymph node status (significantly higher success rate in lymph node-negative patients); higher detection rates were also associated with age <50 years, estrogen receptor positivity, lower proliferation index, and absent
lymphovascular space invasion. The false-negative rate was 19.5% and was only marginally significantly dependent on
lymphovascular space invasion. The overall accuracy of the method was 91.5%. CONCLUSIONS: By using the present
technique, sentinel lymph node biopsy cannot be recommended as a reliable predictor of axillary lymph node status
when performed at the authors’ institution after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Infrequent use of blue dye for lymphatic
mapping, low number of resected sentinel lymph nodes, and absence of any selection among patients included in
the study could be the main factors responsible for the low detection rate and high false-negative rate. Cancer

Axillary lymph node status is among the key determinants of the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Knowledge of it
is necessary not only for staging of the disease but also to assign patients to the appropriate adjuvant treatment. Axillary
lymph node dissection (ALND) is still considered the only reliable way to determine axillary lymph node status in patients
treated by neoadjuvant therapy, although some authors have attempted to find a less invasive alternative to this procedure,
namely ultrasound. Unfortunately, this surgical procedure is associated with severe postoperative morbidity, such as nerve
injury, pain, restricted shoulder motion, arm weakness, and infections. Usual rates of these acute complications are 20%
to 30%.1 However, up to 73% of patients can be affected a few days after ALND, and the severity of the problems positively correlates with the number of lymph nodes removed.2 Many of these conditions can persist for a long time, and
some can even cause impairment of patients until the end of their lives (especially lymphedema).
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a firmly established surrogate for standard axillary dissection in early
breast cancer, with considerably lower morbidity.3,4 Reliability of this approach has been validated in many clinical studies,
the majority of them attaining success rates for identification and removal of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) between 95%
and 100% and false-negative rates between 5% and 10%. Krag published an analysis of 5611 patients from the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-32 study and documented a detection rate of 97.2% and false-negative

rate of 9.8%.5 These results were confirmed by multiple
meta-analyses of the trials; for instance, Kim et al analyzed 8059 patients and calculated a detection rate of
96% and false-negative rate of 7.3%.6 On the basis of
analysis of available data, the American Society of Clinical
Oncology recommended SLNB for routine staging of
early breast cancer.7 This conclusion is in agreement with
the Consensus Conference for SLN recommendation:
SLNB can be considered an accurate method for predicting axillary lymphatic status, with an identification rate of
>90% and false-negativity rate of <5%.8
Preoperative systemic therapy is at present a widely
accepted approach in the treatment of malignant diseases
of the breast. Originally, the reason for its introduction
into treatment was down-staging of tumors that were primarily inoperable (locally advanced or metastatic disease).
Good therapeutic results broadened the usage of this
method to the area of primary operable tumors; diminishing the size of the tumor increases the chance of conservative breast surgery (instead of mastectomy). However,
randomized controlled trials on neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NCT) generally failed to demonstrate prolongation of disease-free interval and overall survival. There are several
advantages to this approach: evaluation of in vivo chemosensitivity of the tumor, possibility of correlating tumor
response with long-term outcome,9 and also opportunity
to address malignant cells located outside the breast. Eradication of these potential sources of metastases occurs not
only in distant locations but also primarily in the axilla. Preoperative chemotherapy was proven to result in significant
regression of axillary nodal involvement; lymph nodes
affected at the time of diagnosis became sterilized in 35%
to 40% cases after NCT.10,11 These dramatic changes considerably alter axillary anatomy; many lymph channels are
blocked (eg, by necrotic cells, apoptosis of tumor cells,12
fibrotic distortion), some lymph nodes can become
unavailable, and lymphatic flow creates alternative pathways for drainage. Moreover, the regression of nodal
involvement is not proportional (it may not follow the
principle of successive regression in nonsentinel lymph
nodes and only after them in SLNs). Identification of the
SLN can be markedly influenced by obstruction of lymph
vessels; the false-negative rate can be increased because of alternative pathways and nonproportional regression of
lymph node metastases. All of these issues raise significant
controversies about the accuracy of sentinel biopsy in
patients after preoperative systemic treatment.
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate success rates for identification and isolation of SLN(s) as well

as false-negative rates of this procedure to determine
whether SLNB technique is feasible also in patients
treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The secondary
aim was to identify factors that can influence the accuracy
of this technique.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This trial presents a retrospective analysis of the medical
records concerning feasibility and accuracy of the combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and SLNB.
The study population was composed of patients
recruited from the leading oncosurgical institution in
Prague, Czech Republic; data collection and analysis were
approved by the institutional headquarters. Between the
years 2005 to 2009, there were 1719 new patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer; 531 of them started
neoadjuvant therapy in a curative manner with the intention of having surgery afterward. In 66 cases, neoadjuvant
hormonal therapy was introduced, and those patients
were not included in this study. No further selection has
been made from the rest of the study population, including those with large tumors, inflammatory cancer, clinically positive lymph nodes, and also with distant organ
metastases. Of these 465 patients, 23 had to be excluded
because they either did not undergo any surgery or the
surgery was performed at other institutions and their medical records were not available. The remaining 442 underwent curative surgery after completing neoadjuvant
treatment—either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy followed by standard axillary dissection. In 343 of
these patients, lymphatic mapping was also introduced
before surgery to identify SLNs. Surgeries were performed
between the years 2005 and 2010 in 3 different teaching
hospitals in Prague.
All patients in this trial had their diagnosis confirmed by core needle biopsy. Complete diagnostic
workup was performed before initiation of treatment,
including physical examination, mammography, ultrasound of the breast and axilla, and staging procedures to
identify distant spread of the disease, so that each patient
was precisely staged according to the TNM system. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans
were used selectively on an individual basis. Pretreatment
biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes was not used, because it
would not change our therapeutic decision. In all patients,
markings of the tumor margins were performed before the
initiation of the therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
always based on a combination containing anthracyclines,

with or without taxanes. Response of the disease was
monitored during neoadjuvant treatment. The number of
chemotherapy cycles was adjusted according to individual
response and tolerability of the drugs. Usually 4 to 8 cycles
were applied to each patient.
The technique of lymphatic mapping has been used
in our practice since 2001. After firmly establishing the
proper technique of mapping and dissection (identification rate 98.1% and false-negative rate 2.4% in early
breast cancer; unpublished data), we started the research
project using SLNB also in patients after NCT. One day
(range, 20-26 hours) before surgery, a single subcutaneous
injection of 0.1 mL radionuclide was used,9,13-15 containing particles of 600 nm in diameter, with total activity
approximating 80 MBq per injection (usually in range of
60-100 MBq). After 30 minutes, lymphoscintigraphy was
performed, and skin was marked with projections of
SLN(s). When breast-conserving surgery was performed,
a separate incision was used for detection of SLNs; in cases
of modified radical mastectomy, the axillary dissection
was performed from the same incision. A handheld probe
was used to measure the gamma activity over the nodes.
Each lymph node exhibiting at least 10% of the activity of
the most active lymph node in the axillary basin was designated as the SLN. After all active nodes in the axilla were
removed, standard level I and II axillary dissection was
performed. Blue dye was reserved for use in only relatively
rare cases (eg, when no SLNs appeared in preoperative
lymphoscintigraphy), because the radio navigation
method was associated with significantly higher identification rates of SLNs.9,13-15 This topic is discussed further.
Histopathological processing of the sentinel and
nonsentinel lymph nodes followed the standards recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer in
2002.16 These methods are routinely used in all breast
cancer patients; no special modification was applied to
this study. All the nodes were formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded; no intraoperative histopathological examinations were performed. Nonsentinel nodes were sectioned
in an interval of 3 mm perpendicularly to their long axis,
embedded into paraffin blocks, and evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining; immunohistochemistry was only used in exceptional cases where suspicious
but not diagnostically malignant cells were identified.
SLNs were cut in the same way; however, 4 serial sections
with an interval of 10 lm were made from each block.
Three of these sections were evaluated with H&E; the
fourth was stained for cytokeratin that detects the presence of malignant elements (antibodies to cytokeratin

4608

AE1/AE3 [DAKO, Carpentaria, Calif] and/or to cytokeratin CK19 [DAKO] were used). Metastatic foci of 0.2 to
2 mm were designated as micrometastases, and metastatic
clusters smaller than 0.2 mm were considered as isolated
tumor cells, irrespective of whether detected by H&E or
by immunohistochemistry.
Statistical analysis was used to determine whether
the categories of variables mentioned in Tables 1 and 2
could influence success rates and/or false-negative rates of
SLNB. Statistical software Statistica 9.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa,
Okla) has been used. A chi-square test for homogeneity
was applied in instances in which at least 75% of cells had
expected counts of 5 or more. In the cases where this condition was not fulfilled, the Fisher exact test was performed. The null hypothesis of homogeneity was rejected
for P < .05 (a statistically significant difference of success
rate and/or false-negative rate of SLNB does exist among
categories of the variable).

RESULTS
The primary goals of our study were to calculate the success rate for identification and removal of SLNs (in
patients for whom SLNB was attempted) and the falsenegative rate of SLNs (in patients with at least 1 positive
axillary lymph node, sentinel or nonsentinel). To our
knowledge, in the field of SLNB after preoperative chemotherapy this series is among the largest studies performed
and is the largest single-institution study ever published.
Study population characteristics before administration of preoperative treatment are summarized in Table 3.
Discrimination values for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and proliferation index were set according
to recommendations for adjuvant therapy from the International Expert Consensus on the Primary Therapy of
Early Breast Cancer 2005.17 As a result of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, a complete pathological response (with no
invasive tumor detected in the surgical specimen of breast
tissue) was reached in 33 (9.6%) patients.
Success Rate for Identification and Removal
of SLNs
At least 1 SLN (with documented gamma activity) was
identified and excised in 277 patients of all the subjects in
whom radiolabeled colloid was applied before surgery
(343 cases). The overall success rate for identification and
removal of at least 1 SLN was 80.8% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 76.6%-84.9%). In the remaining 66
(19.2%) patients there were 54 (15.7%) in whom no

patients. The mean number of dissected axillary nodes,
sentinel or nonsentinel, was 8.38 (range, 1-28).
This success rate was strongly influenced by clinical
lymph node status (significantly higher success rate in
lymph node-negative patients). It was also dependent on
patients’ age (SLN[s] were more often found in patients
<50 years of age) and on tumor features (more frequent
identification rate associated with estrogen receptor positivity, lower proliferation index, and absent lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI]). Other factors were not found
to determine identification rate (patients’ body mass
index, tumor size, tumor localization, grade, histological
type, progesterone receptor positivity, and degree of
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; see also Table 1).

False Negativity of the SLNs
From the 277 patients with at least 1 isolated SLN, 6 subjects had to be excluded because no nonsentinel lymph
nodes were described in the final histopathological report.
One or more SLNs were positive in 95 (35.1%)
cases of 271 subjects with identified SLNs and at least 1
nonsentinel lymph node. In 53 (19.6%) patients SLN(s)
were the only positive lymph nodes in the axillary basin.
In 23 patients, SLNs were negative even in the case of at
least 1 nonsentinel lymph node with detected malignant
cells. This results in a false-negative rate of 19.5% (23/[95
þ 23]; see Table 4; 95% CI, 12.3%-26.6%).
This false negativity was only marginally significantly different according to LVSI: higher false negativity
occurred when neither lymphatic nor vascular invasion
was detected in the tumor (P ¼ .048). None of the other
features significantly influenced the false-negative rate
(characteristics of the tumor, age or weight of patients,
and degree of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; see
also Table 2).

A insignificant trend exists toward higher false negativity with absent estrogen receptors (33.3% with negative
receptors and 15.1% with at least 10% positivity of receptors) and absent progesterone receptors (30.3% with negative receptors and 16.5% with at least 10% positivity of
receptors).
Accuracy of SLN Biopsy
Accuracy is defined by the proportion of patients in
whom SLNB correctly predicted axillary lymph node status. It is calculated as a ratio between all positive SLNs
and true negative SLNs divided by the number of patients
with at least 1 SLN ([95 þ 153]/271); thus, overall accuracy was 91.5% (95% CI, 86.5%-96.5%). The sensitivity
of SLNB was 80.5% (95 of 118; 95% CI, 73.4%-87.7%),
and negative predictive value was 86.9% (153 of 176;
95% CI, 80.9%-93.0%).
Another analysis has been performed to determine
the role of the number of resected SLNs; see also Table 5.
No statistically significant differences were found between
the group of patients with 1 resected SLN and 2 resected
SLNs, neither in false-negative rates nor in accuracy rates.
The false-negative rate was 0% among women with 3 or
more resected SLNs; thus, no statistical comparison was
possible with this group.

DISCUSSION
The role of sentinel biopsy in patients receiving preoperative systemic treatment is currently the subject of numerous debates. Many institutions using SLNB in early breast
cancer are trying to transfer their experience to the group
of patients treated with preoperative therapy. Some of
them are performing SLNB at the time of diagnosis; in
the group of patients with negative SLN, the axillary dissection can be safely omitted. This approach is very similar to the cases of early breast cancer (intact axillary
anatomy); however, the percentage of sentinel negativity
declines with the course of malignant disease, thus leaving

4612

a high proportion of patients subject to standard axillary
dissection. More frequently the opposite approach is
used: performing SLNB after completion of neoadjuvant
therapy. About 1=3 of originally lymph node-positive
patients will benefit from sterilization of axillary nodes
(see above), but this advantage is counteracted by hypothetically altered axillary anatomy decreasing the reliability of sentinel biopsy. Many clinical studies have tried to
evaluate the role of SLNB in this situation. Their results
are slightly controversial; the identification rate varies
among studies between 70% and 100% (usual range is
85%-95%); the false-negative rate oscillates between 0
and 33% (usually reaching 5%-15%). To date, we have
been able to find 7 published studies concerning sentinel
biopsy after preoperative therapy with the number of subjects exceeding 100 cases. Table 6 summarizes the most
important clinical trials in this field.9,18-31 A meta-analysis
of 21 methodologically correct studies (evaluating 1273
patients) confirmed the abovementioned results; the identification rate was 90%, and the false-negative rate was
12%.15
It is interesting to compare these results with metaanalyses of studies without neoadjuvant chemotherapy6,32,33; the identification rate is only slightly lower, but
the false-negative rate is 1.5 to 3 higher after NCT.15 In
contrast, in a Korean study directly comparing patients
with and without neoadjuvant therapy, there were significant differences between identification rates (77.6% vs
97%), but false-negative rates and overall accuracy were
comparable (7.4% and 92.6% vs 5.6% and 95.9%,
respectively).31
Statistical analysis of the results looked at the significance of various characteristics of tumor, patient, surgeon,
and technique in determining whether they can influence
the identification rate and/or false-negative rate of sentinel
biopsy. We analyzed the previously published studies to
compare these results with the significance of corresponding features found by other authors (15 studies are listed
in Table 6). Unfortunately, not all the investigators were

able to perform detailed stratification of both identification rates and false-negative rates according to all abovementioned characteristics (especially in smaller studies,
where the low numbers of cases did not allow statistical
analysis). Therefore, it is not always possible to draw clear
conclusions. The following overview provides comparison
of our results with the findings from other relevant published articles.
Clinical Nodal Status
The significance of clinical nodal status at the time of
presentation has been analyzed in 8 studies; 3 of them
showed higher identification rates in lymph node-negative patients,24,30,31 whereas the remaining 5 did not
find a statistically significant difference.9,21,22,26,28 Moreover, 2 authors found significantly higher identification
rates in lymph node-negative patients after completion
of preoperative chemotherapy.21,31 Nine authors calculated differences in false-negative rates; 3 of them found
higher false-negative rates in lymph node-positive
patients,18,23,28 whereas others did not find significant
differences9,22,24,26,30,31; in 2 studies false-negative rates
were also higher in patients with positive nodes after
completion of chemotherapy.28,30 In our study, the initial lymph node status was highly statistically significant
for detection rate (89.5% in lymph node-negative
patients vs 71.9% in lymph node-positive patients),
whereas false-negative rates did not differ. To generalize,
clinically involved lymph nodes (either at the time of diagnosis or after completion of preoperative chemotherapy) can lower the identification rates of SLNs and
increase false-negative rates of SLNB in breast cancer
patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Size of the Tumor
Size of the tumor at the time of presentation has not been
proved to be a predictive factor for detection of
SLN9,21,24,25,28,34; in only 1 study was the identification
rate significantly lower in larger tumors,31 although in
another study it was lower in larger tumors after finishing
preoperative treatment.21 Two studies proved higher falsenegative rates in patients with larger tumors22,28; a similar
trend (without reaching statistical significance) occurred
in the largest published study (false-negative rate was
5.0% in initial tumor size <2 cm, 9.7% in tumors 2-4
cm, and 13.8% in tumors >4 cm).9 Other authors did
not emphasize original tumor size as a decisive factor for
the false-negative rates.24,26 In our cohort of patients, initial tumor size significantly influenced neither detection

4614

rate nor false-negative rate. With some simplification, we
can conclude that larger size of the tumor usually does not
change detection rates of SLNs, but can be associated with
higher risk of false negativity of SLN.
Response of the Tumor to
Neoadjuvant Therapy
In several trials, a trend toward higher identification rate
was found in patients with poor response to NCT,24,26,30
whereas other investigators confirmed no significant differences.9,25,28 Influence of the therapeutic response to
false-negative rates is not uniform; the differences mostly
do not reach the statistical significance.9,22,24,26,29 No valuable conclusion can be reached on the basis of these
results; the same is true in our study.
Occasionally other factors significantly influenced the
results, including age of the patient and body mass index.
In older patients, the capacity of lymph nodes to retain
radiolabeled colloid may be limited, and thus the detection
rate was decreased13,19,21,25,28,31; the same trend was confirmed in our study. Regarding body mass index, we
hypothesized that radiolabeled colloid might be poorly
taken up by the lymphatic system in fat-replaced postmenopausal breast.21 Our study also found higher detection rates
in patients with >10% positive estrogen receptors, lower
proliferation index Ki67 15%, and absent LVSI; this lymphovascular invasion was the only characteristic that statistically significantly influenced false-negative rate (with higher
false-negative rate in the absence of LVSI).
Regarding the Consensus Conference for SLN recommendation (SLNB can be considered accurate in the
case of identification rate >90% and false-negative rate
<5%8), we must conclude that using the present technique, SLNB cannot be recommended as a reliable predictor of axillary lymph node status when performed at our
institution after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Multiple reasons can be responsible for the results of an overall identification rate of 80.8% and falsenegative rate of 19.5%. Primarily, we must emphasize that
our study population was completely unselected; no group
of patients was a priori excluded. We included also
patients with clinically positive axillary and/or nonaxillary
lymph nodes, cases of inflammatory cancers, and even
metastatic tumors. This is a key difference in comparison
to the vast majority of other published large series.
The second reason for our results could be low
mean number of resected SLNs per patient (n ¼ 1.35).
The abovementioned studies have reported mean
counts of SLNs in the range of 1.5 to 2.08.9,21-23,28-30

Cancer

We can explain this lower number by strictly following
the definition of an SLN; a lymph node can be designated as sentinel when its gamma activity is >10% of
ex vivo counts of the most active SLN and also >10
higher than the background activity.35-37 Thus, some
less active lymph nodes can be regarded as nonsentinel.
We have investigated the influence of the number of
dissected SLNs; neither the false-negative rates nor the
overall accuracy were different between the groups with
1 or 2 resected SLNs. However, among the patients
with 3 resected SLNs, there was not a single case of
false negativity. This suggests that higher numbers of
SLNs obtained can be associated with lower false negativity. We were able to find 2 studies in the literature
supporting this prerequisite (however, neither of them
used neoadjuvant chemotherapy); false-negative rates
were higher only in cases where 1 SLN was obtained
compared with situations where more SLNs were dissected.38,39 Also, the mean number of dissected axillary
lymph nodes (8.38 per patient, sentinel and nonsentinel) was relatively low in our study. The number of
nodes required for TNM and International Federation
of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging is 6. Our intention was not to remove the maximum number of axillary nodes because of our doubts regarding the benefit
to patients (either diagnostic or therapeutic) of extensive axillary dissection of clinically negative lymph
nodes. The lower number of dissected axillary nodes
probably did not negatively influence either the resulting false-negative or detection rates.38
Finally, infrequent usage of blue dye can also participate in lowering of the detection rate of SLNs. The lymph
node can be considered as sentinel when it either stains
with blue dye or has blue afferent lymph vessel. The
necessity of direct visual control during the dissection is
the major flaw of this method and accounts for lower
identification rates compared with radio navigation methods.9,13-15,40 The use of radiolabeled colloid alone or in
combination with blue dye showed comparable identification rates in a meta-analysis of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.15 That is why in our institutions
blue dye was reserved for use in only cases where no SLNs
appear in preoperative lymphoscintigraphy or can be identified by gamma probe (this method was also reported by
other investigators31). Conversely, many authors have
reported higher identification rates and lower false-negative rates when using a combination of radiocolloid with
dye.6,41-43 Blue dye contains smaller particles than radiolabeled colloid, and its chance of passing through partially

blocked lymphatic channels is higher.35 Routine use of
dual agents for SLN mapping may therefore be useful to
increase the identification rates.
Conclusions
With the present technique, SLNB cannot be recommended as a reliable predictor of axillary lymph node status when performed at our institution after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Infrequent use of blue dye for lymphatic
mapping, low number of resected SLNs, and absence of
any selection among patients included in the study could
be the main factors responsible for low detection rate and
high false-negative rate.
