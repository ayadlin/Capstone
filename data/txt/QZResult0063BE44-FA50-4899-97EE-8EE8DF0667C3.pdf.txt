Abstract
Taxanes are very effective at causing mitotic arrest; however, there is variability among cancer cells in the
apoptotic response to mitotic arrest. The variability in clinical efficacy of taxane-based therapy is likely a reflection of this variability in apoptotic response, thus elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the apoptotic
response to mitotic stress could lead to improved clinical strategies. To identify genes whose expression influences the rate and extent of apoptosis after mitotic arrest, we screened a kinase-enriched small interfering
RNA library for effects on caspase activation in response to maximally effective doses of paclitaxel, a PLK1
inhibitor, or cisplatin. Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides directed against an atypical protein kinase,
TP53RK, caused the greatest increase in caspase-3/7 activation in response to antimitotic agents. Time-lapse
microscopy revealed that cells entered mitosis with normal kinetics, but died after entry into mitosis in the
presence of paclitaxel more rapidly when TP53RK was depleted. Because expression levels of TP53RK vary in
cancers, TP53RK levels could provide a molecular marker to predict response to antimitotic agents. TP53RK
inhibition may also sensitize cancers to taxanes. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6325–35. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Paclitaxel, a broadly used cancer drug, binds and stabilizes
microtubules, causing cells to arrest in mitosis due to the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The response
rate is ∼30%, and most responsive patients eventually
relapse, thus, generating interest in understanding mechanisms of resistance to taxanes. Resistance mechanisms include
high expression of efflux pumps, mutations in β1 tubulin,
and aberrant expression of βIII tubulin (1–3). However, it
is unlikely that the large number of taxane nonresponders
can be accounted for by mutations in tubulin or upregulation
of drug transporters. Recent work suggests that the apoptotic
response to mitotic arrest is the key driver of efficacy in preclinical models (4), and a study evaluating serial fine needle
aspirates from breast cancer patients showed that apoptosis,
not mitotic arrest, predicted response to paclitaxel (5). In addition to microtubule-binding agents, there are investigational drugs that inhibit mitotic kinesins or kinases (6, 7). Thus,
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that determine
apoptotic response to antimitotic agents will be critical to
patient selection for taxanes as well as novel agents.

Studies have elucidated some steps in mitotic activation of
apoptosis. Although the initiating events are not clear, mitotic arrest activates c-jun NH2-terminal kinase, which activates Bim by phosphorylating T56 (8), disrupting the
sequestration of Bim by the dynein light chain (9). Bim protein levels also increase during mitotic arrest (10). After release, Bim binds to the antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and
BclXL, releasing Bax and Bak and allowing them to oligomerize and form mitochondrial pores. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization commits cells to death through
apoptosis (11). Bcl-2 and BclXL also undergo inhibitory phosphorylation during mitosis and mitotic arrest (12–16). All
these proapoptotic events occur in mitosis, yet most cells
complete mitosis, even after mitotic delay, without dying.
Therefore, these proapoptotic signals must be restrained,
and some antiapoptotic signaling during mitosis has been
discovered. Caspase-9 and caspase-2 are phosphorylated
and inhibited by CDK1, the mitotic cyclin-dependant kinase
(17, 18), and DAP5 promotes cap-independent translation of
CDK1 and Bcl-2 during mitosis (19).
To identify additional regulators of mitotic induction of
apoptosis, we executed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) chemosensitization screen to identify genes whose expression
modulates the apoptotic response to paclitaxel, a PLK inhibitor (20), or cisplatin. We included cisplatin to distinguish
siRNAs that specifically enhanced mitotic death from those
that were general chemosensitizers, and we included the PLK
inhibitor to determine if the effects were specific to paclitaxel
or mitotic arrest in general. Our screen differs from previous
siRNA chemosensitization screens because we used concentrations of drug that maximally induce cell cycle arrest to identify gene products that influenced the extent of apoptotis

rather than mitotic arrest, as in the case of previous enhancer
screens performed at submaximal doses (21–24). Because of
differences in design of the screen, the hits were largely
distinct from hits identified in previous paclitaxel sensitization screens.
The strongest hit, TP53RK, is an atypical protein kinase
that was first identified in an interleukin-2–activated cytotoxic T-cell subtraction library and shown to bind and phosphorylate p53 on S15 in the presence of an activating cellular
lysate (25). Later studies showed that purified TP53RK is activated by phopshorylation at S250 by Akt (26). Elevated
TP53RK levels are associated with tumor grade in colorectal
adenocarcinoma and, thus, may be an indicator of poor prognosis (27). We characterized the effects of depletion of
TP53RK on the kinetics of mitotic fate.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
MES-SA, MES-SA/MX2, A549, RPE, and HeLa cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection; p53deleted and parental Hct116 cells were obtained from the
Vogelstein laboratory (28); and HeLa-expressing GFP-H2b
were obtained from Hongtao Yu (29). MES-SA and MESSA/MX2 were obtained in 2010; HeLa GFP-H2b and Hct116
p53-matched lines were obtained in 2007; A549, RPE, and
HeLa cells were obtained in 2006. Cell line stocks were frozen
within three passages of receipt, and defrosted stocks were
used within 15 passages after thawing. Inducible p53 small
hairpin RNA (shRNA) RPE cells were constructed using the
pHUSH tetracycline-inducible retrovirus gene transfer vector
(30–32) with a previously described hairpin sequence for p53
(33). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Gene knockdown was verified by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.
paclitaxel (LKT Laboratories, Inc.), cisplatin (Sigma), and
BI2536 were dissolved in DMSO or PBS. CelltiterGlo, CaspaseGlo
3/7 (Promega), RNAiMax (Invitrogen), and TP53RK antibody
(Abnova) were used as per manufacturer's recommendations.
Screening conditions and plate-based assays
A siRNA library consisting of four siRNA duplexes per gene
and designed to target all known kinases and several kinaseregulatory proteins (778 genes) was purchased from Dharmacon. Confirmation and titration assays were performed in
duplicate. shRNA-inducible cells were treated 24 hours before
transfection and maintained in doxycyclin (0.2 μg/mL). Cells
were reverse transfected (20 nmol/L siRNA) for 24 hours followed by 48 hours of drug exposure. Final drug doses were
200 nmol/L paclitaxel, 200 nmol/L BI2536, or 50 μmol/L cisplatin. For caspase inhibition, ZVAD was added 1 hour before
drug addition. A minimal z' of 0.5 or 0.4 for the CelltiterGlo or
CaspaseGlo 3/7, respectively, was required. Dose-response
was analyzed using 4 parameter logistic fit (GraphPad Prism).
Statistical methods
For each test siRNA oligo, two-factor ANOVA was applied to
the natural logarithms of the CellTiterGlo (CTG) response and

6326

Cancer Res; 70(15) August 1, 2010

the ratio of CaspaseGlo (CG) to CTG response. The two factors
were oligo IDs and treatments (e.g., paclitaxel versus DMSO).
The estimates of the interaction terms between the two factors were extracted from the ANOVA analyses, along with
the estimates were the SEMs, P values, and computed q-values.
The interaction terms can be considered as the fold change
between the changes of treatment effects (e.g., paclitaxel versus DMSO) of two oligonucletides. Oligonuceotides were first
selected based on the computed q-values of <0.10, then a hit
list was generated of genes for which two or more of its oligonucleotides had q-values of <0.10. If the effect is >0 (in log
scale), then the effect was termed synergistic; if the effect
was <0 (in log scale), then the effect was termed antagonistic.
Messenger RNA quantification
Messenger RNA was measured with Quantigene2.0 (Panomics) and normalized to cyclophilin. TP53RK Dharmacon
siRNA were TP53RK-6 (D-003108-6), BCL2L1 (J-003458-14),
and BUBR1 (L-004101-00).
Flow cytometry
hTERT-RPE P53(−) shRNA and HELA cells were transfected
with siRNA for 24 hours then treated with 200 nmol/L
paclitaxel. At varying times posttreatment, live cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide (Fluka) or Annexin
V FITC/propidium iodide (Millipore), and analyzed on FACSCaliber (Becton Dickinson), or cells were fixed overnight with
70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide.
Time-lapse microscopy
GFP-H2B–expressing cells were plated on glass-bottomed
24-well plates (Greiner Bio-one) and transfected with indicated siRNA for 24 hours before addition of drug. Fluorescent and phase-contrast images were recorded with a ×10
objective every 15′ on an AxioObserver inverted microscope
(Carl Zeiss) equipped with an environmental chamber
(Okolab), an MS2000 XY stage (Applied Scientific Instruments, Inc.), and a CoolSnap CCD camera (HP). The
chamber was maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2. Devices were
controlled using Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Design).

Results
Identification and validation of screening conditions
We validated our screening procedure using TTK1 and
BubR1 as antagonist controls (34), and BCL2L1 (which encodes BclXL and BclXS) as an agonist control (35). Depletion
of TTK1 or BubR1 dampened the paclitaxel dose response as
measured by cellular ATP using CellTiterGlo. BCL2L1 depletion causes a slight increase in the maximum inhibition
(ymin) with CellTiterGlo, but does not provide an adequate
signal for screening (Fig. 1A). To maximize signal, we measured the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 using a luminescence assay (CaspaseGlo3/7). The total caspase activation
signal will be reduced under conditions in which cell cycle
arrest precedes apoptosis due to the decreased cell number.
To minimize contributions of cell cycle arrest, we normalized
caspase activation to CellTiterGlo signal, which we used as a

surrogate for cell number. This gives a better estimate of caspase activation per cell (Fig. 1B).
In a 384-well plate format, three of four of the BCL2L1
siRNAs significantly increased apoptosis in response to paclitaxel, and all four siRNAs directed against BubR1 decreased
apoptosis in response to paclitaxel (Fig. 1C). The P values for
the four BubR1 siRNAs ranged from 2 × 10−30 to 7 × 10−20. We
concluded that these were suitable screening conditions, and
screened hTERT immortalized RPE cells harboring an inducible shRNA directed against p53. With this cell line, we could
start with a relatively normal genetic background and assess
the contribution of p53 to maintenance of cell viability.
Identification of siRNAs that alter the response of cells
to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and a PLK inhibitor
We screened a kinase-enriched library of synthetic siRNAs
containing four siRNA oligonucleotides for each target. An
example of the analysis (Fig. 1D) illustrates that BubR1 siRNA
antagonizes the apoptotic response to paclitaxel or BI2536
(increased slope compared with DMSO control), but not cisplatin (slope parallel to that of the DMSO control). Using a
false discovery rate of 10% (q value < 0.1), we identified all the
significant interactions from 60,000 data points. These interactions included 115 siRNA targets that enhanced apoptotic
response to paclitaxel, 198 siRNA targets that enhanced response to BI2536, and 58 that enhanced response to cisplatin.
Examples of screening data are show for two hits, TP53RK
and BRAF (Fig. 2A). TP53RK-6 (D-003108-06) enhanced the
apoptotic response to paclitaxel and BI2536, whereas
TP53RK-7 only enhanced the BI2536 response. Both siRNA
oligos reduced levels of TP53RK, but TP53RK-6 was much
more effective than TP53RK-7 (Fig. 3B), suggesting different
thresholds for effect on paclitaxel versus BI2536 response.
Two BRAF-directed siRNA oligonucleotides specifically reduced the apoptotic response to BI2536 (Fig. 2A).
Because a large number of hits were statistically significant, we set a threshold for biological significance. A 2-fold
change in apoptotic response is consistently observed with
siRNA directed against the positive controls for enhancement
(BCL2L1) and antagonism (BubR1), so we selected genes for
which at least two independent siRNA oligonucleotides
caused a 2-fold or greater change in apoptotic response (Supplementary Table S1). We identified 52 genes whose depletion enhanced the apoptotic effects of paclitaxel by the
above criteria. Of these, 21 were also identified as enhancers
of BI2536, whereas only 9 overlapped with cisplatin hits. Only
three hits were common to all three, suggesting that most
were not general chemosensitizers. The antagonistic siRNA
targets displayed even greater overlap between paclitaxel
and BI2536. Of the 52 paclitaxel antagonists, 30 were identified in the BI2536 screen, whereas only 7 overlapped with cisplatin hits. siRNA targets that antagonized the apoptotic
response to paclitaxel or BI2536 included many proteins
required to maintain mitotic arrest, TTK, BubR1, Aurora B
kinase, and CDK1. This is expected and increases our confidence that the hits identified in the screen are mechanism
dependent. The hits from the paclitaxel sensitization screen
were classified into functional classifications using Ingenuity

6328

Cancer Res; 70(15) August 1, 2010

software. After the more general categories such as amino
acid metabolism and posttranslational modification (reflective of the kinase bias of the library), we noted a significant
number of hits related to cell death and cell cycle. Cell
death–related hits were more prevalent in the paclitaxel enhancer list, and cell cycle and cell proliferation hits were
more prevalent in antagonist hits (Fig. 2B).
Confirmation of hits that enhance apoptotic
response to paclitaxel
To evaluate the confirmation rate of the screen, we tested 20
of the top hits for enhancement of paclitaxel or BI2536 response with a 10-point dose response. Eight of 20 hits
confirmed in this assay, giving a confirmation rate of 40%
(Fig. 2C). There were no genes in the set of 20 tested that caused
a significant shift in the CaspaseGlo/CelltiterGlo EC50 compared with the control siRNA. This is consistent with our
assumption that potentiation of the paclitaxel response increases maximum caspase activation rather than shifting the
EC50. siRNA directed against TP53RK (also known as PRPK)
gave the strongest increase in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 2C and D), so we focused on it for detailed analysis.
Of the four TP53RK-directed siRNA oligonucleotides,
TP53RK-6 caused the greatest enhancement of caspase activity in response to BI2536, and TP53RK-7 caused a modest increase (Fig. 3A). Quantification of mRNA and Western blotting
confirmed that TP53RK-6 was the most effective at depleting
TP53RK (95% mRNA reduction), and TP53RK-7 had a more
modest effect (∼60% mRNA reduction; Fig. 3B and C). The
other two siRNAs were not effective at reducing TP53RK levels
and did not have a significant effect on the apoptotic response
to antimitotic agents. Thus, extent of TP53RK depletion correlated with the biological effect of apoptotic enhancement.
TP53RK has p53-dependent and p53-independent
effects on apoptosis
TP53RK has been reported to phosphorylate p53 on Ser15
(25). To determine if p53 was essential for TP53RK function,
we used RPE cells that express a doxycycline-inducible shRNA
directed against p53, and Hct116 cells with homozygous chromosomal deletions of p53 (28). We measured the effects of
BCL2L1 or TP53RK depletion in the pairs of p53+/− cell lines.
Depletion of BCL2L1 had similar effects on enhancement of
caspase activity irrespective of p53 status, resulting in a 2- or
3-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity in Hct116 and RPE cells,
respectively. However, the effects of TP53RK depletion were
greater in the cell lines with wild-type p53 compared with
the p53 minus pair (Fig. 3D). Thus, depletion of TP53RK
causes a p53-dependent and a p53-independent increase in
paclitaxel-induced caspase activation.
TP53RK depletion increases the rate at which
paclitaxel-treated cells die after entry into mitosis
We performed flow cytometry of RPE cells transfected with
siRNA directed against TP53RK, PLK1, BCL2L1, or a control
and exposed to paclitaxel. As expected, cells transfected with
siRNA oligonucleotides directed against PLK1 accumulated
with 4N DNA content. By 24 hours after paclitaxel treatment,

the control siRNA cells had accumulated with 4N DNA content; however, cells transfected with TP53RK, PLK1, or BCL2L1
oligonucleotides had already accumulated with sub2N DNA
content. The siRNA control cells accumulated with sub2N
DNA content by 48 hours posttreatment (Fig. 4A). To confirm
increased apoptosis after paclitaxel in TP53RK or BCL2L1 depletion, we performed a time course using Annexin V and propidium idodide. The peak of Annexin V staining is observed
36 hours after paclitaxel addition, whereas the percent of cells
that are permeable to propidium iodide plateaus later (Supplementary S1; Fig. 4B). To confirm that cells were dying due to
apoptosis after mitotic entry, we performed Western blots on
synchronized cells. SiRNA-transfected cells were released
from S phase into paclitaxel and harvested before mitotic
entry and during mitotic arrest. Cyclin B levels were mon-

itored to confirm mitotic arrest. Caspase-3 cleavage was
evident at an earlier time point after mitotic entry in BCL2L1and TP53RK-depleted cells compared with control. It was
difficult to detect caspase-3 in HeLa cells, so we evaluated
poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which is cleaved more
completely after TP53RK and BCL2L1 depletion. In Hct116
cells, we also noted that levels of bim and noxa were higher
at earlier time points during mitotic arrest in TP53RK or
BCL2L1-depleted cells. To confirm that the observed effects
were dependent on the cellular response to paclitaxel, we assayed cells that overexpress P-gp (MES-SA/MX2), resulting in
a 100-fold diminished sensitivity to paclitaxel. The parent
cells (MES-SA) were sensitized to paclitaxel after TP53RK
depletion. The P-gp–expressing cells also exhibited increased
cell death in response to paclitaxel after TP53RK depletion,

but required100-fold higher concentrations of paclitaxel. To
confirm that sensitization was caspase dependent, we repeated the confirmation assay in the presence of the caspase inhibitor, ZVAD. This completely blocked response in control and
TP53RK-depleted cells (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these
data show that depletion of TP53RK accelerates the rate and
extent of apoptosis after exposure to maximally effective doses
of paclitaxel, and that the effect is dependent on caspase
activity the response to pacitaxel.
For more detailed kinetic and morphologic analysis, we
performed live cell time-lapse microscopy on Hct116 and
HeLa cells expressing GFP-H2b (36, 37). The mitotic fates

observed were completion of mitosis, mitotic slippage, or
death before mitotic exit (Fig. 5A). We could clearly distinguish interphase and mitotic nuclei (Fig. 5B). We used the
phase-contrast images to identify cell death, which we defined as the time at which the cells ceased blebbing, the
plasma membrane was ruptured, and cytoplasm leaked of
the cell. Most HeLa cells died before mitotic exit when exposed to 200 nmol/L paclitaxel, and depletion of TP53RK
or BCL2L1 did not significantly change this. However,
Hct116 cells exhibited a more variable fate, with 55% of the
cells dying before mitotic exit and ∼18% of the cells undergoing mitotic slippage. Depletion of BCL2L1 or TP53RK

decreased the percentage of cells that underwent mitotic
slippage and increased the percentage that died before mitotic exit (Fig. 5C). Dramatic effects were observed in kinetics
of the apoptotic response to paclitaxel. Depletion of BCL2L1
did not affect duration of mitosis in nontreated cells, but
significantly reduced the time between mitotic entry and cell
death in the presence of paclitaxel in HeLa and Hct116 cells
(Fig. 5D). We defined this as the mitotic death interval. The
average mitotic death interval was decreased by ∼4 hours
in the BCL2L1- or TP53RK-depleted HeLa cells compared
with control. These differences were highly significant with
P values of 3.5 × 10−16 and 8.4 × 10−15 for BCL2L1 and TP53RK,
respectively. A similar effect was observed in TP53RKdepleted Hct116 cells (Fig. 5D). The timing of mitotic death
by live cell microscopy correlated well with cytochrome C

release, PARP, and caspase-3 cleavage in the synchronized cell
experiments, ∼10 hours for HeLa cells depleted of TP53RK or
BCL2L1. The kinetics of cell death are faster in Hct116 cells,
with the average mitotic death interval at 7 hours, consistent
with the appearance of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4C). Simultaneously depletion of TP53RK and BCL2L1 (Supplementary
Fig. S1) did not enhance the effect on mitotic death interval
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that both proteins are acting in the
same pathway. We conclude that TP53RK opposes intrinsic
apoptosis signals that result from mitotic stress.

Discussion
We executed a siRNA drug sensitization screen using paclitaxel, BI2536, and cisplatin at concentrations that maximally

induce cell cycle arrest. The choice of screening conditions
was based on the observation that clinically achievable levels
of antimitotic agents cause robust mitotic arrest and that efficacy depends on the efficiency with which mitotic arrest
leads to cancer cell death. To maximize this signal, we measured the ratio of caspase activation to total ATP to separate
the effects of cell cycle arrest from apoptosis. In addition, we
performed our screen in a relatively normal genetic background of hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial
cells. Our screen identified a largely distinct set of hits compared with previous screens in transformed cell lines at subefficacious doses. MacKeigan and colleagues (21) ran a screen
in HeLa cells to identify kinases that promoted resistance to
chemotherapuetic agents, and identified CDK6, CDK8, SGK,
mTOR, FER, JIK, PLK2, and PINK. Of these, we identified
CDK6 as a cisplatin sensitizer, and both CDK6 and CDK8 as
weak paclitaxel sensitizers. A genome-wide paclitaxel sensitization screen run on H1155 cells identified 87 high-confidence
hits that had no overlap with our hits (22). Finally, Swanton
and colleagues (38) ran siRNA sensitization screens on three
cell lines with KRAS mutations. There were a few overlapping
hits for paclitaxel sensitization, including ALK, ARK5, CARKL,
and COL4A3BP. Overlapping antagonist hits include proteins
required to maintain mitotic arrest such as TTK, AURKB, and
BUB1B. Although we had significant overlap in antagonists,
our screen identified many unique paclitaxel sensitizers, as
well as sensitizers to PLK1 inhibition.
Two interesting confirmed hits from our screen are
CDK11 and ALK. CDK11 is required for centrosome maturation (39), required for sister chromatid cohesion (40), and
has recently been shown to be a RanGTP-dependent microtubule stabilization factor that regulates the rate of spindle
assembly (41). Other kinases required for mitotic progression, such as PLK1 and Aurora A kinase (STK6), scored
as antagonistic in the screen, most likely because the individual effects of depletion or paclitaxel cause maximal mitotic arrest but no additional effect on cell death. Because
CDK11 depletion enhances the apoptotic response to antimitotic agents, it may have an additional role in protecting
cells from apoptosis. ALK depletion also enhances the apoptotic response to BI2536 and paclitaxel. Oncogenic ALK
translocations have been identified in lymphoma (42) and

non–small cell lung carcinoma (43), and there are efforts
to develop inhibitors of ALK (44). If normal levels of ALK
protect cancer cells from the cytotoxic effects of antimitotic
agents, ALK inhibitors could have broader utility as chemopotentiating agents.
Depletion of BRAF made cells less sensitive to a PLK inhibitor, leading us to postulate that activating mutations of
BRAF could sensitize cells to PLK inhibition. Interestingly,
in xenograft studies of response to a PLK1 inhibitor, two of
the five sensitive models, Colo-205 and HT29, have the
V600E-activating mutation in BRAF (45). Thus, PLK inhibitors may be useful in cancers that have a high frequency
of BRAF mutation, such as melanoma or colorectal cancer.
This is consistent with work showing that Ras mutant cancer
cells are more sensitive to antimitotic agents, including
BI2536 (46).
Depletion of TP53RK caused the greatest increase in the
apoptotic response to antimitotic agents in confirmation assays. Recent work has shown that there is variability in the
fate of cancer cells in response to mitotic arrest (47–49). Cells
either die directly from mitotic arrest, complete mitosis after
a delay, or slip out of mitotic arrest without completing mitosis and cytokinesis (mitotic slippage). The cells that undergo mitotic slippage either die in the next cell cycle, arrest
their cell cycle, or continue to proliferate. Using time-lapse
microscopy and single cell analysis, we showed that depletion of either BCL2L1 or TP53RK decreases the time from
entry into mitosis in the presence of paclitaxel to cell death.
Although it has been hypothesized that the levels of Bcl-2
family members could influence the fate and kinetics of the
apoptotic response to mitotic arrest (49), this is the first direct demonstration that manipulation of BclX levels decreases the time from mitotic entry to cell death in the
presence of an antimitotic agent. This is important to consider in the context of Bcl-2 and BclXL inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials (11). Combining these Bcl-2 family
antagonists with taxane-based chemotherapy could increase
their efficacy in cancer cell killing during the window of time
when the drug is present in the tumor at pharmacologically
active concentrations.
siRNA depletion of TP53RK had a nearly identical effect of
decreasing the time from mitotic entry to death. This was not

by inhibiting the activity of bim,
either by promoting degradation
or inhibiting its interaction with
BclXL. Alternatively, it could
activate BclXL.

expected from what is known about this protein. TP53RK
was reported to phosphorylate p53 on Ser15, activating its
proapoptotic activity (25, 50). We therefore might expect
more survival upon depletion of TP53RK. However, p53 is
also phosphorylated by ATR and ATM on Ser15 (51), making
this activity redundant. p53 remains phosphorylated on
Ser15 even after depletion of TP53RK,4 suggesting that this
is not the major role of TP53RK in proliferating cells.
Depletion of TP53RK and BCL2L1 had similar effects on
the timing of cell during mitotic arrest, and simultaneous depletion of both TP53RK and BCL2L1 did not enhance the effect. This suggests that these proteins are acting within the
same pathway. Because BclXL sequesters Bax and Bak, we
think it is unlikely that TP53RK acts downstream of BclXL.
We therefore propose two models by which TP53RK could
regulate BclXL during mitotic arrest. The first hypothesis is
that TP53RK activates BCLXL during mitotic arrest, and thus,
its depletion effect is similar to that of BCL2L1 depletion. The
second model is that TP53RK inhibits the activity of Bim, the
BH3-only sensor protein that antagonizes the antiapoptotic
effects of BclXL and Mcl-1 in mitosis. TP53RK could act by
decreasing the binding of Bim to BclXL or by destabilizing
Bim. It has been reported that Bim is phosphorylated by
extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which primes it for
phosphorylation by RSK1/2, leading to ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis (52). Distinct kinases could regulate Bim stability

in mitosis, and TP53RK could have a role either in priming or
directly phosphorylating the degron (Fig. 6).
The levels of TP53PK are variably expressed in cancer
cells, suggesting that it might be useful as a predictive biomarker of response to antimitotic agents. In a study of
breast cancer tissue, TP53RK was significantly overexpressed in lobular breast cancer versus normal tissue (P =
1 × 10−11) and in invasive ductal carcinoma versus normal
(P = 1.8 × 10−12). In an independent breast cancer study,
TP53RK was overexpressed in ductal breast carcinoma
(P = 1 × 10−3; Oncomine). Our studies suggest that expression level of TP53RK may predict response to antimitotic
agents such as taxanes, and inhibitors of mitotic kinases
such as PLK1. Additionally, TP53RK may have potential as
a drug target whose inhibition could sensitize cancer cells
to taxanes or other antimitotic agents.
