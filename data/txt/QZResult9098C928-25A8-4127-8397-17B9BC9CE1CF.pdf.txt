BACKGROUND: Currently, no tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system exists for patients with diffuse malignant
peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM). The primary objective was to formulate a clinicopathological staging system
through the identification of significant prognostic parameters. METHODS: Eight international institutions with prospectively collected data on patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy contributed to the registry. Two hundred ninety-four patients had complete clinicopathological data and
formed the basis of this staging project. RESULTS: Peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was categorized into T1 (PCI 1-10),
T2 (PCI 11-20), T3 (PCI 21-30), and T4 (PCI 30-39). Twenty-two patients had positive lymph nodes (N1) and 12 patients
had extra-abdominal metastases (M1). The survival for patients with T1 (PCI 1-10) N0 M0 was significantly superior to
the other patients. This group of patients is therefore designated as Stage I. The survival of patients with T2 (PCI 1120) and T3 (PCI 21-30), in absence of N1 or M1 disease, was similar. This group of patients was categorized as Stage II.
The survival of patients with T4 (PCI 30-39), N1, and/or M1 was similarly poor. This group of patients was therefore
categorized as Stage III. Three prognostic factors were independently associated with survival in the multivariate
analysis: histological subtype, completeness of cytoreduction, and the proposed TNM staging. The 5-year survival
associated with Stage I, II, and III disease was 87%, 53%, and 29%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed TNM
staging system resulted in significant stratification of survival by stage when applied to the current multi-institutional

Precise, globally accepted staging systems are key to assessing treatment outcomes, comparing results across institutions, designing and analyzing clinical trials, and selecting therapy for individual patients. Currently, no tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system exists for patients with diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM), because the
disease is rare and no effective therapies were available. In this disease with a unique natural history, the new system
requires a logical application of TNM to the primary disease state that is usable by the clinician on a routine basis.
Recently, cytoreductive surgery (CRS), combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), has
emerged as a treatment option that offers a prolonged survival in selected patients, achieving a median survival of up to 60
months and a 5-year survival of 50%.1-5 With this multimodality treatment approach, complete macroscopic cytoreduction is performed. Importantly, this allows adequate tumor specimens to be analyzed.

Original Article

In an attempt to formulate a clinical staging system
with sufficient statistical power, a multi-institutional data
registry on peritoneal mesothelioma was established during the 6th International Workshop on Peritoneal Surface
Malignancy in Lyon in late 2008. Eight international
institutions with prospectively collected data on patients
who underwent treatment consisting of CRS and HIPEC
contributed to the registry. The primary objective was to
formulate a clinicopathological staging system through
identification of statistically significant prognostic
parameters.
Figure 1. Peritoneal cancer index (PCI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Ethics approval was obtained from the participating institutions through their IRB—or the chairperson of the
ethics committee who waived the need for patient consent
for the study, as individual patients were not identified.
Between October 1989 and February 2009, the present
multi-institutional registry collected data on 405 patients
with DMPM, who were considered preoperatively to be
candidates for CRS and HIPEC. Of these 405 patients,
peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was unknown in 110
patients and follow-up data were unavailable in 4 patients.
A total of 294 patients with complete clinicopathologic
and follow-up data were included in this staging project.
All of the included patients had peritoneal mesothelioma confirmed by histopathologic examination and a
treatment strategy that used CRS followed by HIPEC.
Peritonectomy and visceral resections were performed at
the sites of disease involvement, with intent to remove all
tumor deposits together with involved peritoneum. CRS
was performed according to protocol Sugarbaker
described previously.6 In short, peritonectomy procedures
include total anterior parietal peritonectomy, omentectomy  splenectomy, right and left subphrenic peritonectomy, pelvic peritonectomy  rectosigmoid colon
resection, lesser omentectomy  cholecystectomy, and 
peritonectomy of the omental bursa.6 All HIPEC procedures were performed intraoperatively after CRS. The
most common HIPEC regimen was cisplatin combined
with doxorubicin, and paclitaxel for early perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy. It is acknowledged that there
were variations in intraperitoneal chemotherapy exposure
techniques (open or closed), duration (30 to 120
minutes), and intraperitoneal temperatures (40 C to
43 C) among the institutions. However, all studies shared
the 2 most important concepts in treatment rationale:

1856

maximal cytoreduction to remove macroscopic disease
and intraperitoneal chemotherapy delivered immediately
after CRS to eradicate residual tumor cells. The multiple
specimens of gross disease available in all patients provided the clinical material for a thorough assessment of
lymph node status and tumor invasion.

Standardized Data Form
A blinded standard data form was created to retrieve relevant clinical/pathologic data, including age, sex, date of
surgery, extent of prior surgical intervention and performance status, histopathologic subtype, peritoneal cancer
index (PCI), presence of lymph node metastasis, presence
of extra-abdominal metastasis, and completeness of cytoreduction. These variables were included in the subsequent
data analysis for overall survival. The volume and extent
of the tumor deposits were prospectively recorded using
the PCI.7 This assessment combines lesion size (0 to 3)
with tumor distribution (abdominopelvic region 0 to13)
to quantify the extent of disease as a numerical score
(PCI-0 to 39) (Fig. 1).7 Sites and volumes of the residual
disease after CRS were also prospectively recorded using
the completeness of cytoreduction (CC) Score.7 A CC-0
indicated no visible evidence of disease, CC-1 indicated
residual tumors 2.5 mm in diameter, CC-2 indicated
residual tumors between 2.5 mm and 2.5 cm in diameter,
and CC-3 indicated residual tumors >2.5 cm in diameter
or a confluence of tumor nodules present at any site.
Standardized clinical data on consecutive patients from
each of the 8 institutions were entered into a central database. Follow-up data from most recent reviews were
included, consisting of clinical examination and assessment of abdominopelvic CT scans. Each institution confirmed that the pooled data represented consecutive

Variable

Statistical Analysis
The data were reported on intention-to-treat basis; ie, all
patients were selected for the combined procedure, irrespective of completeness of cytoreduction or whether
HIPEC was given or not. Perioperative mortality was
included in the overall survival analysis. Overall survival
was used as the primary endpoint, which was determined
from the time of surgery. Survival analysis was performed
by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using
the log-rank test. For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model (with forward stepwise selection of
covariates and entering/removing limits of P < .10 and
P>.05) was used. All statistical analyses were performed
using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows (Version 17.5; SPSS GmbH, Munich Germany). A
significant difference was defined as P < .05.

Analysis of Standardized Data Form
The mean age at the time of CRS was 50 (S.D. ¼ 14)
years. There were 159 (54%) male patients. Two hundred
fifty-nine patients (88%) had epithelial and 27 patients
(9%) had biphasic or sarcomatoid tumors. Twenty-two
patients (7%) had lymph node metastases. Twelve
patients (4%) had extra-abdominal metastatic disease in
the form of disease penetrating the diaphragm or old abdominal wall scar, which was resected at the time of CRS.
The mean PCI was 20 (S.D. ¼ 10). At the end of surgery,
74 patients (25%) had CC-0 cytoreduction, 64 patients
(22%) had CC-1 cytoreduction, 39 patients had CC-2
cytoreduction (13%), and 35 patients (12%) had CC-3
cytoreduction.
Survival Outcome
One hundred nine patients (37%) were deceased at the
last-time follow-up. The median follow-up period was 24
months (range 1 to 235 months). The overall median survival was 67 months (range 1 to 235 months), with 1-, 3-,
and 5-year survival of 83%, 62% and 52%, respectively.
Univariate analysis identified 7 significant prognostic variables associated with improved survival: age 50 (P ¼
.011), female (P < .001), epithelial subtype (P ¼ .006),
PCI 1-10 (P < .001), absence of lymph node metastasis
(P < .001), absence of extra-abdominal metastasis (P ¼
.004), and CC-0/1 (P < .001) (Table 1).

Selection of Data to be Utilized as a TNM
Staging System
Among these 7 significant prognostic factors, age, gender,
and histopathologic subtype are intrinsic (ie, they are not
influenced by disease progression), and CC score can only
be determined postoperatively. Therefore, these parameters were not suitable for preoperative staging. The
remaining 3 significant prognostic parameters (PCI,
lymph node status, and extra-abdominal metastasis) were
selected for formulating the clinicopathological staging
system.

into novel T stages (n ¼ 294).

T factor—peritoneal cancer index

In the present analysis, PCI was categorized into 4
subgroups: T1 (PCI 1-10), T2 (PCI 11-20), T3 (PCI 2130), and T4 (PCI 30-39), and associated with significant
difference in survival (Fig. 2). The number of patients was
similar in low PCI (T1) and high PCI (T4) subgroups.
Fifty-four patients were categorized into T1 subgroup,
with 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of 92%, 85%, and
85%, respectively. One hundred six patients were categorized into T2 subgroup and had a median survival of 67
months, with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 86%,
65%, and 52%, respectively. Eighty-one patients were
categorized into T3 subgroup and had a median survival
of 56 months, with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of
84%, 57%, and 48%, respectively. Fifty-three patients
were categorized into T4 subgroup and had a median survival of 26 months, with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates
of 63%, 40%, and 30%, respectively.
N factor—lymph node status

Twenty-two patients were found to have positive
lymph nodes (N1) during surgical exploration. Their median survival was 20 months, with 1- and 3-year survival
rates of 62% and 30%, respectively. The median survival
for the patients without positive lymph nodes (N0) was 76
months and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 84%,
64%, and 54%, respectively (Fig. 3). The most common
sites for positive lymph nodes were external, internal, and

common iliac lymph nodes. Ten patients had positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes located along the external,
internal, and common iliac vessels. Among these 10
patients, 1 also had positive gastrohepatic ligament nodes;
1 had epigastric, left inguinal, paracaval, and para-aortic
nodes; and 1 had positive ileocolic, right deep inferior epigastric, and right inguinal nodes. Four patients had positive ileocolic lymph nodes only. Two patients had positive
mesenteric lymph nodes only. Two patients had positive
lymph nodes located in the gastrohepatic ligament only.
M factor—extra-abdominal disease

Twelve patients had extra-abdominal metastatic disease (M1) in the form of tumor penetrating the diaphragm
(or old abdominal wall scar), which was resected at the
time of CRS. Despite resection, the prognosis for these
patients was markedly poorer than the patients without
extra-abdominal metastasis (M0) (Fig. 4). The median
survival for M0 disease was 76 months, with 1-, 3-, and 5year survival of 83%, 63%, and 54%, respectively. In contrast, the median survival of M1 disease was 20 months,
with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of 74%, 33%, and 0%,
respectively.
Superimposed survival curves consisting of PCI,
lymph node status, and extra-abdominal metastasis are
demonstrated in Figure 5 (P < .001). The figure demonstrated that 1) the survival for patients with T1 (PCI 1-10)

as Stage I DMPM; 2) the survival outcomes of patients
with T2 (PCI 11-20) and T3 (PCI 21-30) in absence of
N1 or M1, were similar, and therefore they should be

categorized as Stage II DMPM; and 3) the survival outcomes of patients with T4 (PCI 30-39), N1, and/or M1
were similarly poor, and therefore should be categorized
as Stage III disease. The proposed TNM staging system
(Table 2) resulted in significant stratification of survival
by stage when applied to the current multi-institutional
registry data (Fig. 6). The 5-year survival for patients
with Stage I, II, and III disease was 87%, 53%, and 29%,
respectively.
Multivariate Analysis
The significant prognostic variables identified in univariate analysis, including age, gender, subtype, the proposed
clinical staging system, and CC score, were entered into a
Cox proportional hazards model. Three prognostic factors
were independently associated with survival in the multivariate analysis: biphasic/sarcomatoid subtypes versus
epithelial subtype (P < .001; hazard ratio: 5.507; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 2.877-10.540); CC-2/3 versus
CC-0/1 (P ¼ .005; hazard ratio: 1.983; 95% CI, 1.2253.209); and the proposed TNM staging system (P <.001;
stage II vs stage I hazard ratio: 3.313; 95% CI, 1.1539.435; stage III vs stage I hazard ratio: 5.952; 95% CI,
2.054-17.248).

DISCUSSION
The aim of establishing a clinical staging system for
DMPM is to allow clinicians to identify the most appropriate surgical candidates, stratify treatment regimens,
and more accurately predict prognosis. In the past
DMPM was regarded as a terminal disease, and no effective therapies existed.8 Because of the localized nature of
the disease, a renewed interest in selecting appropriate surTable 2. Proposed TNM Stage Grouping for Diffuse Malignant

gical candidates for the combined treatment approach
involving CRS and HIPEC has emerged in recent years.
This is encouraged by promising treatment outcomes
published by several specialist centers worldwide.1-5 As
DMPM evolves into a surgically treatable disease, a globally accepted staging system is needed to allow meaningful
comparisons and evaluations.
Because of the unusual natural history of DMPM,
lack of a TNM system in DMPM is not surprising. The T
stage is diffuse disease widely dispersed on peritoneal
surfaces. Also, the disease is rare, and most centers do not
have a sufficient number of patients to statistically evaluate results of treatment. Before CRS and HIPEC, treatments used in these patients varied greatly. Most studies
in the current literature have a relatively small sample size,
and the clinical implications of these reports, in terms of
their value for patient management, are limited. The present registry represents a collaborative effort demonstrating

clinical outcomes of peritoneal mesothelioma patients
treated by the combined treatment strategy. This comprehensive analysis enabled the unambiguous retrospective
audit of key clinicopathological features in the multi-institutional registry required for establishing an outcomebased staging system. From our database we demonstrated
that the prognosis of patients with DMPM, as with a
majority of other solid tumors, is largely determined by
tumor pathology (histopathologic subtype), surgical intervention (completeness of cytoreduction), and TNM staging. The proposed TNM staging system involves distinct
clinical and pathological parameters, where the T factor is
examined intraoperatively at the time of exploratory laparotomy, N factor is examined during histopathology of the
surgical specimens, and M factor is examined preoperatively using various imaging techniques.

lems with using CC score for staging DMPM, as this
prognostic information is unavailable preoperatively in
the patient selection process. In an attempt to predict the
likelihood of achieving complete cytoreduction, Yan et al
published a radiologic staging system for DMPM showing that interpretive CT findings of the small bowel and
mesentery are useful in determining operability of a
patient with DMPM.12 Small volume disease in abdominopelvic region II (epigastric region) or Class I/II small
bowel regions indicating no distortion of gross anatomy
identifies patients likely to receive complete cytoreduction. Conversely, in Class III disease, whereby the small
bowel and mesentery on CT appear so thickened and
grossly distorted, complete cytoreduction is never achievable. Knowledgeable use of preoperative CT allows the
oncologist to avoid extensive treatments in patients
unlikely to benefit.

Tumor pathology

The pathological classification of DMPM consists
of epithelial, sarcomatoid, and biphasic types.9 Survival of
the nonepithelial subtype is extremely poor.4 However,
the clinical significance of this finding is restricted,
because of the small percentage of patients with the nonepithelial subtype in DMPM. Based on current clinical
data, the combined procedure is not recommended to
patients with nonepithelial subtype. The first attempt to
formulate a pathologic grading system for DMPM was by
Goldblum and Hart in 1995.10 They described a nuclear
grading system, which categorized nuclear size into 4
grades. Kerrigan and colleagues first tested this nuclear
grading system in 25 female patients with DMPM who
underwent a variety of surgical, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy treatments and found that the nuclear grading
was not strongly associated with long-term survival.11 Yan
and colleagues recently demonstrated nuclear size was the
only independent prognostic factor for overall survival in
62 patients.5 The 3-year survival rates with nuclear size of
10-20 lm, 21-30 lm, 31-40 lm and >40 lm were
100%, 87%, 27%, and 0%, respectively. However, the
relationship of increasing nuclear size to a tumor’s aggressive biological behavior has not been determined, and the
reproducibility of the pathologic grading system derived
from nuclear size needs to be validated in larger prospective cohorts.
Completeness of cytoreduction

Nearly all peritonectomy centers agree that adequate
cytoreduction is one of the most significant prognostic
factors for long-term survival.1-5 However, there are prob-

Proposed TNM staging system

For most solid tumors, the disease process has been
effectively modeled in terms of assessment of the primary
lesion (T factor), lymphatic spread (N factor), and distant
metastasis (M factor), expressed in a TNM staging framework.13 With better understanding of the natural history
of DMPM, it is realized that the disease is initially confined to the peritoneal cavity and rarely metastasizes to
lymph node and distant sites, unless in the advanced stage.
As DMPM becomes a surgical disease, developing a
TNM staging is plausible.
The use of PCI is the innovation that causes our
present proposal to function for DMPM as a surrogate
for T stage. In this disease, no single primary tumor is
the focus for subsequent cancer spread and metastases.
Rather, at diagnosis thousands of mesothelioma nodules
are present, widely distributed on peritoneal surfaces.
To quantify the diffuse peritoneal cancer dissemination,
we suggest the PCI be used to measure the extent of the
primary disease. The PCI has been validated as an accurate metric of peritoneal surface dissemination.14-16 The
T factor (as examined in this study) is performed intraoperatively through PCI scoring. Whether a preoperative T factor may be classified using radiological scoring
of the PCI remains uncertain, owing to the failures of
modern imaging techniques on capturing peritoneal
disease.17
Another important finding about DMPM recently
uncovered regards the necessary assessment of lymph
node status as part of the CRS. Several reports have shown
that nodal dissemination is one of the most significant

1861

indicators for survival.18,19 Lymph node metastases are
uncommon in patients with DMPM, but when they
occur they are associated with a poor prognosis. Data
from the Washington Cancer Institute showed that 7
patients had positive lymph nodes.18 Their median survival was 6 months, with 1- and 2-year survival of 43%
and 0%, respectively. Ninety-three patients had absence
of lymph node involvement and their median survival was
59 months, with 5- and 7-year survival of 50% and 43%,
respectively.18 Baratti and coworkers demonstrated a 5year survival of 82.5% for patients with pathologically
negative lymph nodes, compared with 16.7% for those
with positive lymph nodes.19 Inclusion of a N stage in a
TNM system for DMPM may lead to improved intraoperative assessment of the prognosis. The crucial importance of lymph node metastasis should encourage
surgeons to vigorously search for abnormal appearing
nodes when performing CRS. Any enlarged or firm
lymph nodes should be submitted for pathological evaluation separately from the rest of the specimens. It should
become current surgical practice to sample all suspicious
lymph nodes, identify their location, and submit them
separately in patients with DMPM to better determine
prognosis and provide more knowledge in the management of these patients.
In this series, 12 patients had extra-abdominal metastatic disease in the form of disease penetrating the diaphragm, and 2 patients also had disease invading through
the old abdominal wall scar. Although the extra-abdominal disease was resected at the time of surgery, the prognosis for these 12 patients was markedly poorer than the
patients without extra-abdominal metastasis. This may
represent the biologically invasive nature of the tumor,
and the prognosis of this subgroup of patients should be
guarded. It must be emphasized that the total number of
patients with nodal disease and distant metastases was
small, as these patients are often not candidates for the
combined treatment. Hence, adequate characterization of
subgroups within this patient cohort with advanced disease is not possible through this registry. Patients with
advanced disease (ie, stage III) in this study nevertheless
still showed encouraging survival results with median survival of 26 months. It is likely that the patients with more
advanced disease (those excluded from the combined
treatment) would be classified as stage IV disease.
The proposed clinicopathologic staging system is
based exclusively on patients treated with CRS and
HIPEC. It emphasizes the prognostic importance of tumor volume and distribution within the peritoneal cavity

1862

(PCI), lymph node involvement, and extra-abdominal
metastasis. This staging system would be extremely useful
for patients considered for the combined treatment modality, which is the only therapeutic option associated
with a prolonged survival in this disease to date. The proposed TNM staging system should be validated in a prospective manner in the future.
