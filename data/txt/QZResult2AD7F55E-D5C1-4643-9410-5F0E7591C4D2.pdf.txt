ABSTRACT
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies
of the digestive tract in East Asian countries. Multimodal therapies, including adjuvant
chemotherapy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, have become more often used for
patients with advanced ESCC. However, the chemotherapy effect is often limited by
patients’ drug resistance. This study demonstrated that EIF5A2 (eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 5A2) overexpression induced stemness and chemoresistance in ESCC
cells. We showed that EIF5A2 overexpression in ESCC cells resulted in increased
chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), docetaxel and taxol. In contrast, shRNAs
suppressing eIF5A2 increased tumor sensitivity to these chemotherapeutic drugs.
In addition, EIF5A2 overexpression was correlated with a poorer overall survival in
patients with ESCC who underwent taxane-based chemotherapy after esophagectomy
(P < 0.05). Based on these results, we suggest that EIF5A2 could be a predictive
biomarker for selecting appropriate chemo-treatment for ESCC patients and EIF5A2
inhibitors might be considered as combination therapy to enhance chemosensitivity
in patients with ESCC.

5A2, and that it was important in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and metastasis of ESCC [5]. Recently,
the ablation or inhibition of EIF5A2 was also reported
to enhance the chemosensitivity of HCC (hepatocellular
carcinoma) cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/doxorubicin and
breast cancer cells and bladder cancer cells to doxorubicin
[6–9]. Despite these reports, the underlying mechanism of
acquired chemosensitivity of silencing EIF5A2 is poorly
defined. Because chemotherapy is becoming more widely
used as adjuvant therapy for patients with ESCC, a better
understanding of the mechanisms of chemoresistance
of EIF5A2 is therefore critical for selecting treatments
and the development of potential strategies to overcome
chemoresistance.
In this study, we sought to explore the role of
EIF5A2 in the chemoresistance of ESCC cells, and we
tested the chemosensitivity in both EIF5A2 overexpressed
cells and knock-down cells. In addition, EIF5A2
overexpression enhanced the stemness of ESCC cells

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
is the seventh most common cancer and the fifth most
common cause of cancer-related death in the world [1].
Esophagectomy remains the mainstay of treatment for
resectable disease. However, the prognosis for patients
treated by surgery alone is poor. Recent developments
in postoperative management, including chemotherapy
and fractionized radiation therapy, have contributed to
improvements in the surgical outcome [2–4]. Because
chemotherapy is useful as adjuvant therapy before or
after surgery for potentially resectable tumors, it has led
to considerable interest in the identification of predictive
biomarkers for selecting appropriate treatments for
patients with ESCC.
Our previous study demonstrated that chromosomal
amplification and hypoxia could induce the expression
of EIF5A2, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor

and inhibited the apoptosis activated by chemotherapy
treatment. Moreover, our results show that the EIF5A2
expression in resected ESCC specimens is correlated
with a worse clinical outcome and response to adjuvant
chemotherapy, suggesting an important clinical application
of EIF5A2 in selecting appropriate chemo-treatments for
patients with ESCC.

taxol than 510-Vec cells (Figure 2A). To rule out the
possibility that the resistance of chemotherapy induced
by EIF5A2 overexpression is specific to KYSE510 and
its derivative cells, another ESCC cell line, KYSE410,
was next studied. Similar results were observed in the
410-eIF5A2 cells and 410-Vec cells (Figure 2B).

Chemo-sensitivity increased by EIF5A2 silencing

RESULTS

We next examined whether silencing EIF5A2
expression would increase the chemo-sensitivity by
knocking down EIF5A2 expression in KYSE180 and
EC109 cells. The ESCC cells were transduced with
lentivirus containing shRNAs (sh1 and sh2) against
eIF5A2 (Figure 3A), and cytotoxicity assays were
carried out. It was found that KYSE180 with reduced
EIF5A2 expression were more sensitive to 5-FU,
docetaxel and taxol than the vector control cells (Figure
3B, 3C). Similar results were observed in EC109 cells
(Figure 3D, 3E and 3F).

EIF5A2 increased the stemness of ESCC cells
Our previous study showed that EIF5A2
introduction could increase the tumorigenicity of ESCC
cells in vivo and in vitro [5]. To determine whether
EIF5A2 introduction is sufficient to enhance the stemness
of ESCC cells, the eIF5A2 and vector stably transfected
KYSE510 cells were established, and sphere assays were
performed. The sphere-forming ability of 510-eIF5A2
cells was significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared to
that of vector control cells (510-Vec) (Figure 1A and 1B),
suggesting that EIF5A2 increased self-renewal ability.
Then, we extended our analysis by examining
the expression levels of stemness-associated genes by
qRT-PCR on EIF5A2 overexpressed cells. The RNA
levels of nanog [10], p75NTR [11], OCT-4 [12], CD24
[13] and CD44 [14] increased in the range of 2.8-fold
(p75NTR) up to 11-fold (nanog) in EIF5A2 overexpressed
KYSE510 cells (510-eIF5A2) compared with vector
control cells (P < 0.01; Figure 1C). Similar results were
also observed in EIF5A2 overexpressed KYSE410 cells
(410-eIF5A2) (Figure 1A and 1D). Taken together, these
findings revealed that EIF5A2 overexpression increased
the stemness of ESCC cells. The RNA level of ABCG2
(ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G, member 2) [15], a
multiple drug-resistant transporter gene, also increased by
1.6-fold in 510-eIF5A2 and 5.9-fold in 410-eIF5A2 cells
(P < 0.01; Figure 1C and 1D). The protein levels of nanog,
p75NTR, CD24, CD44 and ABCG2 increased in varying
degrees in EIF5A2 overexpressed cells (510-eIF5A2 and
410-eIF5A2) compared with their respective vector control
cells (Figure 1E and 1F).

EIF5A2 conferred chemoresistance by inhibiting
apoptosis in ESCC cells
We next elucidated whether EIF5A2 accounts for
chemoresistance through inhibiting apoptosis. 510-eIF5A2
cells and 510-Vec cells were treated with 5-FU, docetaxel
and taxol, and in situ TUNEL assays were performed.
As shown in Figure 4A, the number of apoptotic cells
decreased in 510-eIF5A2 cells compared with 510-Vec
cells. Similar results were obtained in KYSE410 derived
cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, KYSE180 transduced with
shRNA suppressing eIF5A2 (180-sh1) and vector control
cells (180-Vec) were also treated with chemotherapeutic
reagents, and the in situ TUNEL results also indicated
an increased apoptotic response toward 5-FU, docetaxel
and taxol in EIF5A2 knock-down cells compared with
vector control cells (Figure 4C). Similar results were
also obtained in EC109-derived cells (Figure 4D). These
findings support that the preferential survival of EIF5A2
overexpressed cells after chemotherapy reagents was
attributed to low rates of apoptosis. The activation of
PARP and caspase-8, two typical characteristics of cell
apoptosis, was also investigated by western blotting
in EIF5A2 overexpressed cells and silenced cells. As
shown in Figure 5A, the cleaved PARP and caspase-8
were decreased in the 510-eIF5A2 cells compared with
510-Vec cells after treatment with 5-FU, docetaxel and
taxol. In addition, overexpression of eIF5A2 in KYSE410
significantly decreased the cleaved PARP in comparison
with the vector control cells (Figure 5B). As shown in
Figure 5C, EIF5A2 knock-down resulted in an increase
of PARP and caspase-8 activation in KYSE180 cells after
treatment with 5-FU, docetaxel and taxol. Additionally,
EIF5A2 knock-down resulted in an activation of PARP
in EC109 cells treated with 5-FU, docetaxel and taxol
(Figure 5D).

Chemoresistance induced by EIF5A2
overexpression
Because drug resistance is one of the characters of
cancer stem cells and a multiple drug-resistant transporter
gene increased in the EIF5A2 overexpressed cells, we next
investigated whether EIF5A2 overexpression contributes
to the chemoresistance of ESCC cells. For this purpose,
XTT assays were used to evaluate the chemoresistance
between EIF5A2 overexpressed KYSE510 cells
(510-eIF5A2) and vector control cells (510-Vec). The
510-eIF5A2 cells were more resistant to 5-FU than the
vector cells (Figure 2A). The results demonstrated that
510-eIF5A2 cells were more resistant to docetaxel and

with N status (P = 0.011) (Table 1). The Kaplan-Meier

correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) in patients

metastasis but also a complicated reprogramming process
through which differentiated epithelial cells reverse to an
undifferentiated state by acquiring stem cell-like function
[24], we tested whether forced expression of EIF5A2
could endow the cells with stem cell properties. Our
results indicated that EIF5A2 overexpression enhanced the
stemness of the 510-eIF5A2 cells and induced multiple
cancer stem cell markers.
Cancer stem cells are supposed to be responsible
for not only tumor initiation and maintenance but also
resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and early
recurrence. We previously reported that shRNAs
suppressing eIF5A2 combined with chemotherapeutic
reagent effectively reduced the volume and weight
of xenografts in nude mice [5]. Additionally, some
in vitro studies reported that knock-down or inhibition
of EIF5A2 enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCC
cells to 5-FU/ doxorubicin and breast cancer cells and
bladder cancer cells to doxorubicin [6–9]. Because
adjuvant therapy has been increasingly used in the
treatment of advanced ESCC, we tested whether
EIF5A2 induced chemoresistance of ESCC cells. The
overexpression of eIF5A2 in the ESCC cells (KYSE510
and KYSE410) led to increased chemoresistance to
5-FU, docetaxel and taxol; whereas shRNA-mediated
silencing of eIF5A2 in the ESCC cells (KYSE180
and EC109) increased chemosensitivity towards these
chemotherapeutic agents.

DISCUSSION
ESCC is one of the most lethal malignancies of the
digestive tract in East Asian countries. Often, when many
cases are initially diagnosed, the malignancy is already in
an advanced stage. Multimodal therapies are necessary
to prolong the survival of patients with ESCC. Adjuvant
chemotherapy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy have
become the first-line therapy for patients with advanced
ESCC [4]. However, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is
often limited by drug resistance of the patients. Therefore,
it is very important to screen predictive biomarkers for
chemosensitivity to select appropriate regimens for
patients with ESCC.
Overexpression of EIF5A2 has been detected
in many solid tumors, including ovarian cancer [16],
hepatocellular carcinoma [17, 18], non-small cell
lung cancer [19], bladder cancer [20], melanoma [21],
colorectal cancer [22], pancreatic adenocarcinoma [23]
and ESCC [5]. It was also reported that EIF5A2 could
promote tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in ESCC and
hepatocellular carcinoma [5, 6, 18]. Our previous studies
found that EMT was involved in the above processes
[5, 18]. Because EMT is not only a process to acquire

Cancer stem cell chemoresistance is explained
by slow cycling, efflux of drugs by ATP binding
cassette transporters and upregulation of anti-apoptosis
[25, 26]. Our study found that the RNA and protein levels
of ABCG2 were increased in EIF5A2 overexpressed
cells. ABCG2 is an important member of the ABC
transporter superfamily that has been suggested to be
involved in multidrug resistance in cancer [27]. It has
a diverse range of substrates, including doxorubicin,
imatinib, and mitoxantrone [28]. This result is consistent
with the previous findings that silencing or inhibition of
EIF5A2 led to sensitization of some cancer cells toward
doxorubicin [7–9].

5-FU is widely used in cancer chemotherapy. It
inhibits thymidylate synthase, an essential enzyme for
the de novo synthesis of thymidylate and subsequently
DNA synthesis. This results in imbalance of dTTP/
dUTP and DNA damage. Both the imbalance and DNA
damage lead to apoptosis [29]. It was also reported
that silencing of endogenous EIF5A2 increased tumor
perfusion by remodeling tumor vessels, thus increased
the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to 5-FU in vivo [6].
In this study, western blotting assay demonstrated that
overexpression of EIF5A2 reduced the activation of PARP
and caspase-8 after treatment with chemotherapeutics; in
contrast, knock-down of EIF5A2 increased the PARP and

caspase-8 activation in comparison with the vector control
cells. These findings support the role of anti-apoptosis in
the gain and manifestation of chemoresistance conferred
by EIF5A2 in ESCC cells.
Long-term survival of patients with ESCC is poor
due to high rates of therapeutic failure and tumor relapse.
Discovering reliable chemosensitivity markers that could
accurately predict clinical outcome is beneficial. In our
study, the Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that EIF5A2
expression was associated with a poorer survival in patients
with ESCC who underwent taxane-based chemotherapy
after esophagectomy. Based on our results, we believe that
inhibition of EIF5A2 could be a highly effective strategy
in overcoming 5-FU or taxane-based chemoresistance in
a clinical setting. N1-guanyl-1, 7-diaminoheptane (GC7),

which inhibits EIF5A2 activation [8], could be considered
as a combination therapy to enhance chemosensitivity in
patients with ESCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue samples
Between December 2004 and August 2009, a
retrospective cohort of 89 patients with ESCC who
underwent esophagectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy at
Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center was enrolled in this
study. The patients were diagnosed with primary ESCC,
and none of them had received preoperative chemotherapy,
preoperative radiotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

shRNAs suppressing eIF5A2 were from Sigma-Aldrich
company (Shanghai, China). The lentiviruses were packaged
in 293FT cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen, CA). The stable cell lines (overexpressed or
knock-down) were established after cells were transduced
with lentiviruses (plenti-eIF5A2 or shRNAs) and selected
with puromycin. The concentration of puromycin for the
cell lines selection was listed as: KYSE510 (1.2 μg/ml),
KYSE410 (0.6 μg/ml), KYSE180 (0.5 μg/ml) and EC109
(0.6 μg/ml).

Staging was uniformly defined using the criteria set forth
by the 6th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer
Guidelines. Of the 89 patients who received taxane-based
chemotherapy, 62 (69.7%) underwent taxol-based regimens
and 27 (30.3%) underwent docetaxel-based regimens. The
age of the patients ranged from 35 to 72 years at the time
of surgery (median age: 55 years). The median followup time was 60 months (inverted Kaplan-Meier analysis)
[30]. Tissue samples used in the study were approved by
the Committees for Ethical Review of Research Involving
Human Subjects in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.

Concerter-POD and analyzed under light microscope.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC was performed using the standard streptavidinbiotin-peroxidase complex method. Briefly, the tissue
sections were deparaffinized and subjected to antigen
retrieval in EDTA antigen retrieval buffer (ZSGB-BIO,
Beijing, China). Then the sections were incubated with
the diluted primary antibody EIF5A2 (1:50) (Wolwo,
Shanghai, China) overnight at 4°C. After incubation with
horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Real
Envision Detection Kit, Gene Tech, Shanghai, China) for
30 min, the sections were counterstained with Mayer’s
hematoxylin. Expression of EIF5A2 was scored as absent
(total absence of staining), very weak (faint staining in
< 25% of tumor cells), moderate (moderate staining in ≥
25% to < 75%, or strong staining in < 25% of tumor cells),
and strong (moderate staining in ≥ 75% or strong staining
in ≥ 25% of tumor cells). In the present study, absent/
very weak staining was defined as negative staining and
moderate/strong staining as positive staining.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Cell signaling
technology, Danvers, MA), the proteins were fractionated
by SDS-PAGE and western blotting was performed. The
blots were incubated with diluted primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C. Then, blots were exposed to the
appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology, MA) at 1:3000 for 2 h at room
temperature. Finally blots were developed with Luminata
Crescendo western HRP substrate (Millipore, MA). The
following antibodies were used: EIF5A2 (1:1000) (Wolwo,
Shanghai, China), Casepase-8 (1:1000), PARP (1:1000),
CD44 (1:500), nanog (1:500) and p75NTR (1:500) (Cell
Signaling Technology, MA), ABCG2 (1:500), CD24
(1:500), β-tubulin (1:1000) and actin (1:1000) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, TX).

Statistical analysis
Statistical calculations were carried out with the
SPSS 16.0 software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
Survival curves were generated according to the KaplanMeier method and log-rank tests. All data were expressed
as the means ± SEM. The results were considered
statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Cytotoxicity assay
The drugs used in the study were: 5-FU (SunRise
Ltd., Shanghai, China), docetaxel (Aventis Pharma
S.A., Bridgewater, NJ) and taxol (Wellso Pharma,
Beijing, China). Chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity
was determined using an XTT assay (CCK-8, Dojindo,
Kyushu, Japan). Cells were plated in 96-well plates at
the appropriate density. Twenty-four hours later, cells
were treated with 2-fold diluted concentrations of drugs
for another 70 hours at 37°C. Then the XTT assay was
performed and assayed at OD450 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Three independent assays
were performed.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In situ cell death detection assay

The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Apoptotic cells were detected using an in situ
Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science, IN)
according to the protocol. Cells were plated on the cover
slides and treated with different chemotherapy regents.
Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed with PBS
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking and
incubation in permeabilisation buffer, apoptotic cells
were determined by the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end
