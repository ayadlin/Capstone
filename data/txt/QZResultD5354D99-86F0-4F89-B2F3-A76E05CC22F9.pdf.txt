Abstract
Resistance to anticancer therapeutics greatly affects the phenotypic and functional properties of tumor cells,
but how chemoresistance contributes to the tumorigenic activities of cancer stem-like cells remains unclear. In
this study, we found that a characteristic of cancer stem-like cells from chemoresistant tumors (CSC-R) is the
ability to produce a variety of proinﬂammatory cytokines and to generate M2-like immunoregulatory myeloid
cells from CD14þ monocytes. Furthermore, we identiﬁed the IFN-regulated transcription factor IRF5 as a CSC-R–
speciﬁc factor critical for promoting M-CSF production and generating tumorigenic myeloid cells. Importantly,
myeloid cells primed with IRF5þ CSC-R facilitate the tumorigenic and stem cell activities of bulk tumors.
Importantly, the activation of IRF5/M-CSF pathways in tumor cells were correlated with the number of tumorassociated CSF1 receptorþ M2 macrophages in patients with non–small lung cancer. Collectively, our ﬁndings
show how chemoresistance affects the properties of CSCs in their niche microenvironments. Cancer Res; 74(10);

Introduction
Resistance to anticancer modalities poses serious obstacles
that must be addressed to improve the clinical prognosis for
patients with cancer. Recent studies have revealed that multiple mechanisms enable the development of resistance to
anticancer therapies through genetic alterations and environmental modiﬁcations such as vascular and immunologic
remodeling within tumor tissues (1–4). Coordinated intrinsic
and extrinsic pressures force tumor cells to accommodate to
stressful microenvironments and coopt multiple strategies for
survival, invasion, and distant metastasis, further enhancing
tumorigenicity and worsening clinical prognosis. Accumulating evidence has established that rare populations termed
cancer stem cells (CSC) are indispensable as a main source
of tumorigenicity and anticancer drug resistance (5). Although
it remains largely unclear whether chemoresistance further
modiﬁes the phenotypic and functional manifestations of
CSCs, previous studies have revealed that the low sensitivity
to cytotoxic therapies of CSCs derives mainly from cellular
quiescence and multidrug transporter activity (6).

In this study, we elucidate an unexpected property of CSCs
derived from chemoresistant tumors (CSC-R). Although such
CSCs are identical to untreated CSCs in self-renewal and
phenotypic properties, they have a unique ability to produce
various proinﬂammatory mediators that act to generate tumorigenic myeloid cells. IFN regulatory factor-5 (IRF5) plays a
critical role as a CSC-R–speciﬁc transcription factor that facilitates M-CSF production and promotes myeloid cell–mediated
tumorigenic activities. Our ﬁndings provide novel mechanisms,
whereby resistance to anticancer therapies changes the biologic
character of CSCs in distinct niche microenvironments.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor cell lines
NOD–SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient) animals were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All experiments were conducted under a protocol
approved by the animal care committees of Hokkaido University (Sapporo, Japan).
Tumor cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and HCT116) were obtained
from the American Tissue Culture Collection. All cell lines
described above were obtained 1 year before being used in
experiments and authenticated by the Central Institute for
Experimental Animals (Kawasaki, Japan) for interspecies and
mycoplasma contamination by PCR within 3 months before
the experiments.
Patient samples
The clinical protocols for this study were approved by the
committees in the Institutional Review Board of Hokkaido
University Hospital (approval number, 10-0114). Pleural effusion cells were obtained from patients with stage IV non–small
cell lung cancers (NSCLC) after written informed consents had

been obtained. The cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque
density centrifugation, and further puriﬁed as EpCAMþ epithelial cells and CD14þ monocytes from tumor tissues or
pleural effusion.
Generation of chemoresistant tumor cells
To generate chemoresistant tumor cells, MDA-MB-231 cells
or HCT116 cells were treated with taxane or CDDP at low
concentrations (1 mg/mL) for 96 hours, respectively. The cells
were extensively washed three times and then treated with the
identical drug at same concentrations for additional ﬁve
passage times. The generation of chemoresistant cell variants
of MDA-MB-231 or HCT116 cells was conﬁrmed by the nearcomplete resistance to cell death (90% or more) by the treatment with taxane or CDDP, respectively.
Flow cytometry
The expression levels of CD44 and ALDH1 for CSC-R and
CSC-N were evaluated with anti-human CD44 antibody
(BD Biosciences) and ALDEFOUR reagents (VERITAS),
respectively. For myeloid cell analysis, monocytes stimulated
with M-CSF, with supernatants of CSC-R or with those of
CSC-N were stained with anti-CD206 antibody and antiCD68 antibody (BD Biosciences). The cell viability of tumor
cells treated cytotoxic drugs was examined by staining with
Annexin V/propidium iodide staining according to the
manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). The cells were
subjected to ﬂow cytometry using a FACSCaliber.
Sphere-forming assay
For sphere-forming assays, CSC-R, CSC-N, or bulk MDA-MB231 cells primed with myeloid cells (1,000 cells/well) were
cultured in ultra-low attachment culture dishes (Corning) in
serum-free medium. Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium/F-12
serum-free medium was supplemented with 20 ng/mL epithelial growth factor and 10 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth factor
(bFGF)-2 (PeproTech). Digestion and cell passage were performed every 3 days, and the sphere-forming colonies were
counted after three serial passages.

polarization (ARG-1, Relm-a, IL-4R) or effector functions (IL10, IL-12p70, CXCL9, IFN-g) were quantiﬁed by real-time PCR
(RT-PCR) using SYBR Green Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems).
Luciferase reporter assay for NF-kB and IFN-stimulated
response element
CSC-R or CSC-N from MDA-MB-231 or HCT116 was treated
with taxane or CDDP, respectively, and transfected with control or IRF5 siRNA (50 rGrArCUrCrCUrGUUrCrCrArArATT30 )
for 24 hours. The cells were then transiently transfected with
ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter plasmid encoding NF-kB or IFNstimulated response element (ISRE) and control Renilla luciferase plasmid (1 ng) for 20 hours. The luciferase activities of
lysates from the cells were shown as a ratio of ﬁreﬂy reporter
intensities to control Renilla intensities.
Immunoblotting
CSC-R or CSC-N from MDA-MB-231 or HCT116 was subjected to Western blotting to quantify the protein levels of IRF5
by using antibodies for human IRF5 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology). b-Actin was used as a loading control to check
the integrity of each sample.
RNA interference
The siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed by Ontarget plus SMART pool reagents designed to target human
IRF5 (Thermo-Dharmacon). The human IRF5 or control siRNAs
were transfected into tumor cells by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Myeloid cell–mediated tumorigenic activities
CSC-R, CSC-N, or bulk tumor populations from MDA-MB231 cells were transfected with control or IRF5 siRNA for 48
hours, and then cocultured with CD14þ monocytes for 96
hours. The myeloid cells primed with CSC-R were isolated
from cocultured cells and further cultured for 24 hours to
obtain culture supernatant. Bulk MDA-MB-231 or HCT116
cells treated with the supernatant of CSC-R–primed myeloid
cells were subjected to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and
sphere formation analysis.

Measurement of cytokine and chemokines
CSCs, non-CSC, or bulk cells from treatment-na€ve or chemoresistant tumors (MDA-MB-231 or HCT116; 1  106/well at
start point) were cultured for 48 hours, and the protein levels of
cytokines and chemokines were quantiﬁed by ELISA using
supernatants obtained from cultured CSC-R and CSC-N
according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences).

In vivo tumorigenic activities of CSCs mediated by
human myeloid cells
After depletion of endogenous myeloid cells by clodronate
liposome (200 mg/mouse) intraperitoneally administered twice
a week, the CSC-N or CSC-R isolated from HCT-116 cells were
injected subcutaneously into NOD–SCID mice at small doses
(1  102/mice) in conjunction with intravenous administration
of CD68þ macrophage (1  106/mice) isolated from the
peripheral blood of the healthy donor. The tumor growth was
measured on the indicated days, and numbers of human
macrophages were evaluated in tumors from each mice.

Results
Characterization of CSCs derived from chemoresistant
tumors
Cytotoxic chemotherapy manipulates multiple signaling
cascades, including DNA damage pathways, cell death machineries, oncogenic signaling, and chromatin remodeling–associated events (1, 7). CSCs serve as the apex of cellular hierarchy
responsible for tumor initiation and progression, but whether
biologic alterations linked with chemoresistance further modulate the tumorigenic activities of CSCs remains largely
unknown. To deﬁne this, we generated chemoresistant variants of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and HCT116 colon
cancer cells through repetitive exposure to low doses of taxane
and cisplatin, respectively (8). CSCs were isolated from these
chemoresistant and sensitive variants based on their identical
CSC marker expression (Fig. 1A). CSCs derived from chemoresistant variants (CSC-R) were refractory to cytotoxic therapies
compared with CSCs from untreated tumor cells (CSC-N).
However, the frequencies of CSCs were nearly identical with
similar expression levels of CSC markers (ALDH1 and CD44)
on na€ve and chemoresistant tumor cells (Fig. 1B), and there
were little differences between CSC-N and CSC-R on the selfrenewal activities as shown by similar levels of sphere-forming
activities (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the chemoresistant cell variants generated from the treatment-na€ve CD44 non-CSC
subsets did not exhibit the phenotypic and functional properties of CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, chemoresistance
does not render non-CSC with plasticity to undergo transdifferentiate into CSCs.
Together, our ﬁndings potentially suggest that CSC-N undergoes intrinsic genetic and/or epigenetic alternation to transform into the CSC-R upon chronic exposure with cytotoxic
drugs, but further studies should be required for deﬁning this
possibility by comprehensive genetic analysis.
Proinﬂammatory proﬁle of CSCs derived from
chemoresistant tumor cells
Inﬂammatory signals play a critical role in the regulation
of the stem cell characteristics and tumorigenic activities

of CSCs through autocrine and paracrine-mediated mechanisms (9–11). We, therefore, next evaluated the possibility
that chemoresistance modiﬁes inﬂammatory proﬁles in
CSCs from MDA-MB-231. To our surprise, we found that
mRNA levels of various cytokines and chemokines, such as
IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40, TNF-a, M-CSF, and CCL2 were
produced in CSC-R subsets at higher amounts compared
with the bulk tumor cell counterparts, although bulk chemoresistant cells could produce proinﬂammatory mediators at higher levels than CSC-N or treatment-na€ve bulk
tumor cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). We also
conﬁrmed the higher protein levels of several cytokines
(M-CSF, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa) in CSC-R compared with
bulk or non-CSC populations (Fig. 2B and data not shown).
Consistent with its proinﬂammatory activities, the transcriptional activity of NF-kB was higher in CSC-R compared
with CSC-N (Fig. 2C). We observed similar trends in CSC-R
from HCT-116 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore,
the chemotherapy-na€ve CSCs from MDA-MB-231 cells did
not produce proinﬂammatory cytokines such as M-CSF
when they were treated with cytotoxic drug taxane for a
brief period, suggesting that acute stress responses changes
evoked by exposure of cytotoxic drugs had little effects in
modifying inﬂammatory proﬁles of CSCs (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that chemoresistance rendered CSCs with the ability to triggers
autocrine activation of inﬂammatory signals, which subsequently resulted in the production of proinﬂammatory
mediators.
CSC-R prime monocytes to differentiate into M2
macrophages
Given the characteristic proinﬂammatory cytokine proﬁles of CSC-R, we focused our study on the effects of CSC-R–
mediated inﬂammatory signals on phenotypic and functional properties of macrophages, because myeloid cells have a
tremendous impact on the regulation of tumorigenic activities and anticancer drug resistance (12, 13). Macrophages
express several immunoregulatory genes that are closely
linked with impaired tumor immunosurveillance (14). We
found that CSC-R culture supernatants induced several
factors characteristic of M2 macrophages, such as arginase-I, CSF1R, IL-4R, Relm-a and IL-10, C/EBPa, and PU.1
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2B). In contrast, there was
little difference between CSC-R and CSC-N in the expression
of IL-12p70, IFN-g, and CXCL9, which are associated with M1
phenotypes (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the treatment with CSCR–derived soluble factors upregulated the M2 macrophage
marker CD206 mannose receptor at comparable levels with
the treatment with M-CSF. However, bulk chemoresistant
cells could generate M2 macrophages at higher levels than
CSC-N or treatment-na€ve tumor counterparts (Fig. 3C). It is
notable that bulk tumor cells are capable for differentiating
the M2 macrophages from CD14þ monocytes, but non-CSCs
had little ability in differentiating into M2 macrophages
compared with nontreatment control (Fig. 3C). Thus, it is
highly likely that the M2 macrophage differentiation by
the bulk tumors relies mainly on the CSCs contained within

chemoresistance itself differentiate M2 macrophage by CSCindependent fashion. Furthermore, supernatant of the chemotherapy-na€ve MDA-MB-231 CSC-N treated with taxane

treatment/passage cycles. We found that the CSC-N generate M-CSF and prime M2 macrophages in concomitant with
acquisition of chemoresistant phenotype (Supplementary
Fig. S3C and S3D). To further address whether CSC-R differs
from CSC-N in their unique activities of priming M2-macrophages in vivo, CSC-N or CSC-R isolated from HCT-116 cells
were injected subcutaneously into NOD–SCID mice at small
doses (1  102/mice) in conjunction with intravenous administration of CD14þ monocytes (1  106/mice) isolated from
the peripheral blood of the healthy donor, and the tumor
formations were evaluated in vivo. In this experiment, NOD–
SCID mice were pretreated with clodronate liposome to
remove endogenous macrophages. Although the CSC-R–driven tumors were grown at greater levels than CSC-N tumors,
their tumorigenicity was positively correlated with the presence of myeloid cells, because its tumor growth was accelerated by adoptive transfer of human monocytes. In marked
contrast, the transfer of human monocytes had little effects
on the CSC-N–derived tumor growth (Fig. 3D). More importantly, human CD68þ macrophages expressing the putative
M2 marker CD163 and CD206 were inﬁltrated into the tumor
tissues of CSC-R at greater levels than those of CSC-N (Fig.
3E). In contrast, the frequencies of CD163lowHLA-DRhigh M1
macrophages were comparable in tumors from CSC-R and
CSC-N (Fig. 3E). Together, these results further support our
hypothesis that CSC-R speciﬁcally regulates inﬁltration and
differentiation of immunoregulatory M2 macrophages.

2702

Cancer Res; 74(10) May 15, 2014

Interestingly, the supernatants of CSC-R contributed to the
induction of CD33þHLA-DRlow myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC) at higher levels than those of CSC-N or non-CSC
counterparts. In addition, the induced MDSCs were homogenously CD14þCD15 monocytic subsets when treated with
either CSC or non-CSCs from chemoresistant or treatmentna€ve cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Again, CSC-N acutely
treated with chemotherapy did not induce M2-like macrophages, suggesting that CSCs could not acquire an ability to
prime tolerogenic myeloid cells by chemotherapy-mediated
acute stress responses (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Together, these results suggested that soluble factors
released from CSC-R may regulate the differentiation of immunosuppressive macrophages from monocyte precursors, which
have a great impact on tumorigenicity.
Upregulation of IRF5 promotes M-CSF production from
CSC-R
In addition to NF-kB–mediated inﬂammatory signals, transcriptional activities mediated by ISREs were detected in CSCR at much higher levels than those in CSC-N (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, type I IFN and transcriptional activities of IFN-g
activation sequences (GAS) were detected in CSC-R at levels
similar to those in CSC-N upon chemotherapy (Fig. 4A).
Given that IFNs signal through Janus-activated kinase (JAK)/
STAT pathways to induce IFN stimulation genes, which are
under control of ISRE and GAS elements, we hypothesized that

CSC-R have a unique ability to stimulate ISRE-mediated transcriptional activities using autocrine IFN and/or JAK/STAT–
independent mechanisms (15). IRFs serve upstream of ISREs,
which have distinct and overlapping roles for IFN-g/GAS–
related signals. To evaluate the role of IRFs in the regulation
of ISRE transcriptional activities, we used speciﬁc siRNA gene
knockdown (KD) of each of the IRF genes (IRF1-9) in HCT-116
CSC-R and then treated the cells with cisplatin for 24 hours. In
this analysis, we identiﬁed IRF5 as a critical factor, which is
speciﬁcally expressed in CSC-R and regulate ISRE activities.
The knockdown of IRF5, but not that of other IRF families,
diminished the transcriptional activities of ISRE in CSC-R (Fig.
4B). In contrast, ISRE activities remained unchanged in CSC-N

www.aacrjournals.org

regardless to the inhibition of IRF members, including IRF5
(Fig. 4B). We also conﬁrmed that the mRNA levels of IRF5
expression were detected in CSC-R at much higher levels than
parental tumors or CSC-N, and the protein levels of IRF5 were
also higher in CSC-R from MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 compared with the CSC-N counterparts (Fig. 4C and D).
To deﬁne the functional relevance of IRF5 to the immunemodulatory effects of CSC-R, we next examined whether IRF5
either regulates selective sets of cytokines or, instead, generally
affects inﬂammatory signals. The siRNA knockdown of IRF5
suppressed M-CSF production from CSC-R but not non–CSC-R
or CSC-N, whereas IRF5 had little impact on the regulation of
other soluble mediators in CSC-R (Fig. 4E and data not shown).

of CSF1R, arginase-I (ArgI) or Relm-a in macrophages primed with CSCs were measured by RT-PCR. G, CSC-R, CSC-N, or bulk tumor cells (HCT-116)
were transfected with control or IRF5 siRNA for 48 hours and then treated with anti–M-CSF–neutralizing antibody (clone 26730), control Ig, or recombinant
þ
M-CSF for 24 hours. The 20% supernatant of each tumor subsets was used for treating with CD14 monocytes isolated from PBL for 48 hours. The
þ
CD206 expression on CD68 macrophages was determined by ﬂow cytometry. We repeated three experiments with all similar results.  , P < 0.05.

Importantly, IRF5 inhibition substantially reduced the ability
of CSC-R to induce several factors critical for M2 macrophage
differentiation in CD14þmonocytes, but addition of M-CSF
recovered the expression levels of M2 factors in macrophages
primed with IRF5-KD CSC-R at comparable levels with those
primed with control CSC-R, further indicating that IRF5-mediated M-CSF of CSC-R is critical for inducting M2 macrophage–
associated factors (Fig. 4F).
The IRF5-dependent effects in priming M2 macrophage
differentiation were largely dependent on M-CSF from CSCR because the CSC-R–mediated induction of CD206þ macro-

phages was substantially diminished by the treatment with
anti–M-CSF–neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4G). Moreover, the
treatment with recombinant M-CSF proteins increased CD206
expression on monocytes treated with CSC-N at similar levels
to those with CSC-R, and abrogated the suppressive effect of
IRF5 siRNA in priming M2-like macrophages by CSC-R (Fig.
4G). Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrated that the IRF5–
M-CSF pathway speciﬁcally regulated by CSC-R plays a critical
role in priming immunoregulatory myeloid cells.

Characteristics of Chemoresistant CSCs

CD166 (16). We found that the frequencies of CD133þCD44þ
populations were similar on na€ve tumor cells and their chemoresistant variants. Furthermore, CD44þCD133þHCT116CSC-R displayed higher expression of IRF5, M-CSF production,
and M2 macrophage differentiation, compared with CD44þ
CD133þ CSC-N, further validating the importance of the
IRF5–M-CSF pathway in deﬁning CSC-R to activate immunosuppressive myeloid cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly,
M-CSF was detected in the CSC-N from HCT116 cells, unlike
those from MDA-MB-231 cells. However, M-CSF was produced
from HCT-116–derived CSC-N by an IRF5-independent manner,
because the knockdown of IRF5 had a little impact on basal
levels of M-CSF in HCT116-CSC-N (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Therefore, the baseline levels of M-CSF were valuable among
different cell lines, but chemoresistance conferred CSCs capable
of selectively using IRF5 for M-CSF production.
Taken together, these results identiﬁed IRF5 as a critical
transcriptional factor in CSC-R that suppresses the induction
of tumorigenic and immunosuppressive macrophages by promoting M-CSF production.
CSC-R–derived IRF5 renders myeloid cells competent to
promote tumorigenicity and chemoresistance
Several studies have revealed that IRF5 plays an antitumor
role through the induction of cell death programs by cellintrinsic and immune-mediated mechanisms (17–19). Our
ﬁndings that IRF5 is selectively activated in CSC-R suggest
that this transcription factor may potentially have unique
functions distinct from those it has in chemosensitive tumors
and immune cells. To deﬁne the functional signiﬁcance of
IRF5-regulated CSC-R/macrophage cross-talk, bulk HCT116
colon cancer cells were treated with supernatants from human
macrophages prestimulated with CSC-R or IRF5-KD CSC-R,
and then subjected to in vitro chemotherapy to induce apoptosis. The supernatant from macrophages primed with CSC-R
suppressed apoptosis. In contrast, supernatant from macrophages stimulated by IRF5-KD CSC-R sensitized bulk HCT116
tumor cells to apoptotic cell death upon CDDP treatment at
levels comparable with untreated cells (Fig. 5A). The importance of IRF5-regulated pathways in CSC/macrophage interaction was further conﬁrmed using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (data not shown).
We next evaluated the role of IRF5 in long-term tumor
sphere-forming activity, which is a common characteristic of
CSCs. The supernatant of CSC-R–primed macrophages increased sphere numbers and diameters in bulk MDA-MB-231
cells, but knockdown of IRF5 in CSC-R decreased the macrophage-mediated sphere-forming activities of MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, treatment with anti-CSF1R–neutralizing antibodies completely suppressed sphere formation
in HCT-116 cells primed by either control CSC-R or IRF5-KD
CSC-R, suggesting that M-CSF produced by CSC-R–stimulated
macrophages plays a critical role in inducing the stem cell
activities of bulk tumor cells (Fig. 5B). Although the supernatants of CSC-N had a little ability in promoting sphere
formation of bulk MDA-MB-231 cells, they support the sphere
formation in the presence of recombinant M-CSF at similar
extent with the CSC-R supernatants (Supplementary Fig. S6).

www.aacrjournals.org

These results further support our hypothesis that IRF5-mediated M-CSF of CSC-R plays an indispensable role in activating
tumorigenic activities of bulk tumor cells by triggering CSC
properties.
To further deﬁne the contribution of CSC-R–speciﬁc
IRF5 to the regulation of in vivo tumorigenic activities in
clinically relevant settings, we used clinical samples of patient refractory to anticancer therapies after extensive intervention by multiple rounds of chemotherapy and EGFR–TKI
(tyrosine kinase inhibitor; geﬁtinib). The CD14þ monocytes
isolated from peripheral blood of these patients were cocultured with EpCAMþCD133þ autologous CSCs transfected
with control or IRF5 siRNA for 48 hours. Interestingly, the
CSC marker ALDH1 expression were substantially increased in bulk primary NSCLC cells stimulated by the CSCprimed monocytes, whereas CSC-primed monocytes had
little effects on ALDH1 expression in the CSC-depleted bulk
tumor cells (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that CSC-R–
activated myeloid cells speciﬁcally expand the resident
populations of CSCs, but they did not undergo the transdifferentiation from non-CSC to CSCs or increased tumorigenicity by CSC-independent manner.
We next evaluated whether the IRF5–M-CSF axis in CSCs
promote in vivo tumorigenicity by using these primary
NSCLC tumors. To do so, the bulk tumor populations were
injected subcutaneously into NOD–SCID mice in low numbers
(1  102/mice) in conjunction with the CSC-primed monocytes, and the in vivo tumor formations were evaluated at the
indicated times. To exclude the involvement of endogenous
macrophages, NOD–SCID mice were pretreated with clodronate liposomes to remove endogenous macrophages before all
procedures. Cotransfer of CSC-primed monocytes resulted in
larger tumor formation compared with those of non–CSCprimed monocytes or untreated tumor cells. Importantly,
tumor growth was markedly suppressed by adoptive transfer
of CSC–IRF5-KD–primed monocytes (Fig. 5D). Overall, these
ﬁndings provide clear evidence that IRF5-mediated regulation
of CSC–myeloid cell interactions serves as a critical pathway
supporting tumorigenicity and chemoresistance.
Clinical signiﬁcance of IRF5–M-CSF pathways
Finally, we sought to determine whether our observations
could be veriﬁed in the clinically relevant settings. To do so,
we obtained pleural effusion cells from patients with stage
IV NSCLC to check the mRNA levels of IRF5 and M-CSF in
EpCAMþ epithelial cells. We also analyzed total numbers of
CSF1R-positive macrophages in NSCLC tumors, which have
been known as tumorigenic and immunosuppressive subsets
in human cancers (20, 21). We found that mRNA levels of
IRF5 were highly correlated with those of M-CSF in tumor
tissues in patients with NSCLC (Fig. 6). Moreover, there
were positive relationships between the number of CSF1Rþ
CD68þ macrophages and levels of IRF5 or M-CSF in NSCLC
tumors, whereas the activation of IRF5–M-CSF pathways
was not correlated with total numbers of CD68þ macrophages (Fig. 6). Finally, the expression levels of CSC maker
ALDH1 mRNA was also correlated with the those of IRF5,
M-CSF, as well as CSF1Rþ cell numbers (Fig. 6). Together,

these ﬁndings support the notion that the IRF5/M-CSF
pathway positively regulates tumorigenic myeloid cells and
CSC activities in patients with cancer.

Discussion
Although intrinsic genetic and epigenetic alterations serve
as a mainstay, leading to generalized chemoresistance in transformed cells, it remains largely unclear whether these chemoresistant phenotypes further modulate the biologic prop-

erties of specialized subsets of tumorigenic populations. In
particular, CSCs have emerged as the main tumor-initiating
and -propagating cells and are responsible for acquiring chemoresistance through multidrug transporter activities and
cellular quiescence. Therefore, it is critical to clarify whether
altered drug sensitivities modulate other functional properties of CSCs. Here, we provide the ﬁrst evidence that CSCs
isolated from therapy-resistant tumors have unique tumorigenic properties compared with those from untreated counterparts. CSC-R promoted M-CSF production through an

IRF5-dependent mechanism, and IRF5-mediated M-CSF further facilitated the tumorigenicity of bulk tumor cells by
activating tumorigenic myeloid cells. These ﬁndings offer a
major advance in understanding the molecular machineries,
whereby responses to anticancer therapeutics serve as a critical factor in regulating the functional plasticity of CSCs and
may greatly affect prognosis and therapeutic responses in
patients with cancer.
IRF5 has been considered a tumor-suppressive factor that
activates apoptosis-related signaling pathways in transformed
cells and creates antitumor inﬂammatory microenvironments
through immune cells (17–19). Moreover, deletions of chromosome 7q32 are associated with downregulation of IRF5
function, disease progression, and poor prognosis in patients
with marginal zone lymphoma. Genetic polymorphisms of
IRF5 may serve as biomarkers to predict clinical responses to
immunotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with melanoma
and hematologic malignancies, respectively (22–24).

www.aacrjournals.org

Previous study revealed that IRF5 serves as a lineage marker
for M1-type macrophages, and macrophages promote the
generation of immunogenic Th1 or Th17 subsets by an
IRF5-dependent manner (25). In marked contrast, we demonstrate that IRF5 expressed on chemoresistant CSCs contributes
to the differentiation of M2-like macrophages by M-CSF–
mediated mechanisms. Thus, transcription factors that have
been known as a proinﬂammatory mediator might be changed
to an immune suppressor under speciﬁc conditions in which
therapeutic interventions could reconstruct the complex
genetic and epigenetic networks in tumor cells. Moreover,
these "transformation" of cross-talks between tumor cells and
immune cells may dramatically change phenotypic properties
and biologic actions of identical genes and their pathways.
Furthermore, chemoresistance may modify the tumor microenvironments and create a specialized chemoresistant niche
that further ampliﬁes the tumorigenic and therapy-resistant
behaviors of tumor cells (1–4). Thus, it is essential to reexamine

the molecular and functional dynamics of various regulators
identiﬁed as "tumor suppressors" according to therapeutic
interventions.
We demonstrated that IRF5-dependent induction of M-CSF
is a key step in the generation of tumorigenic myeloid cells by
CSC-R. Although the molecular mechanisms by which CSC-R
regulate M-CSF production remain to be deﬁned, several
transcription factors, such as PU.1, C/EBP-a, and NF-kB, may
coordinate with IRF5 to regulate speciﬁc sets of cytokines and
growth factors. Moreover, PU.1 associates with various types of
IRFs to amplify its transcriptional activities, which greatly
modiﬁes the immunologic functions of myeloid cells in multiple ways (26–29). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that IRF5
may cooperate with various myeloid cell differentiation factors
in CSC-R and that such cooperation may be critically involved
in the genetic and epigenetic control of M-CSF expression.
We also found that CSC-R have unique propensities to
activate inﬂammatory signals, thus inducing multiple sets of
cytokines and chemokines. Among them, TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8
have emerged as tumorigenic mediators that link various
inﬂammatory signals with oncogenic cascades to create
tumorigenic microenvironments (30–32). In addition, CCL2
supports the recruitment of CCR2þ inﬂammatory monocytes
into tumor tissues, which serves as a key step in generating
tumorigenic macrophages (33, 34). Thus, it is important to
address how the distinct and coordinated actions of these
inﬂammatory mediators affect the tumorigenicity and anticancer drug responses of CSCs within the privileged tumor
microenvironments.
In conclusion, we provide a novel pathway whereby
responsiveness to anticancer drugs determines the plasticity

and biologic properties of CSCs in part through the paracrine regulation of tumor-associated nontransformed cells.
Comprehensive analysis of CSC-niche interactions upon
exposure to various types of anticancer agents should clarify
the molecular and cellular pathways that govern CSC functions and reveal new therapeutic options in clinically relevant settings.
