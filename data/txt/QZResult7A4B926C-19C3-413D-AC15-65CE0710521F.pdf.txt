ABSTRACT
Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors prevent the breakdown of cGMP that
results in prolonged protein kinase G activation and the generation of nitric oxide.
PDE5 inhibitors enhanced the anti-NSCLC cell effects of the NSCLC therapeutic
pemetrexed. [Pemetrexed + sildenafil] activated an eIF2α – ATF4 – CHOP – Beclin1
pathway causing formation of toxic autophagosomes; activated a protective IRE1 –
XBP-1 – chaperone induction pathway; and activated a toxic eIF2α – CHOP – DR4 /
DR5 / CD95 induction pathway. [Pemetrexed + sildenafil] reduced the expression of
c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL that was blocked in a cell-type -dependent fashion by
either over-expression of HSP90 / GRP78 / HSP70 / HSP27 or by blockade of eIF2αCHOP signaling. Knock down of PKGI/II abolished the ability of sildenafil to enhance
pemetrexed toxicity whereas pan-inhibition of NOS using L-NAME or knock down of
[iNOS + eNOS] only partially reduced the lethal drug interaction. Pemetrexed reduced
the ATPase activities of HSP90 and HSP70 in an ATM-AMPK-dependent fashion that
was enhanced by sildenafil signaling via PKGI/II. The drug combination activated an
ATM-AMPK-TSC2 pathway that was associated with reduced mTOR S2448 and ULK-1
S757 phosphorylation and increased ULK-1 S317 and ATG13 S318 phosphorylation.
These effects were prevented by chaperone over-expression or by expression of an
activated form of mTOR that prevented autophagosome formation and reduced cell
killing. In two models of NSCLC, sildenafil enhanced the ability of pemetrexed to
suppress tumor growth. Collectively we argue that the combination of [pemetrexed
+ PDE5 inhibitor] should be explored in a new NSCLC phase I trial.

drugs sorafenib, regorafenib and pazopanib to cause
further inhibition of chaperone ATPase activities and a
more rapid NH2-terminus conformational change [1, 2,
5–9].
The changes in chaperone ATPase activity
and conformation after [regorafenib + sildenafil],
[sorafenib + sildenafil] and [pazopanib + sildenafil]
exposure in prior publications were also reflected in the
phosphorylation / activity of key chaperoned proteins
[1, 2]. The multi-kinase inhibitor drugs interacted
with sildenafil to inactivate the chaperone GRP78
that was associated with a large increase in PERK
auto-phosphorylation and with subsequent eIF2α
phosphorylation. Elevated eIF2α signaling increased

INTRODUCTION
Sorafenib, in addition to being an inhibitor of
protein kinases was also recently discovered to be a potent
inhibitor of chaperone ATPase activities that are associated
with conformational changes in the ATP binding NH2termini of the chaperone proteins and with the abilities
of these chaperones to associate and co-localize with
other chaperones as well as client proteins [1, 2]. It was
reported that cGMP/PKG phosphorylation of chaperones
inactivates their ATPase activities [3, 4]. More recently,
it was shown that that PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil
(Viagra) did not significantly alter basal chaperone ATPase
activities but instead facilitated the multi-kinase inhibitor

the expression of the autophagy regulatory protein
Beclin1. The drugs also interacted with sildenafil to
inactivate HSP90 and HSP70 which in turn lost their
ability to associate with HSP27. Combined loss of
GRP78 and HSP27 function reduced signaling through
the PI3 kinase pathway, causing mTOR inactivation.
Reduced mTOR activity resulted in ULK-1 S757
phosphorylation declining and the phosphorylation of
the ULK-1 substrate, ATG13 S318, becoming elevated.
Phospho-ATG13 S318 was localized in autophagosomes
with Beclin1. Knock down of ULK-1, ATG13 or Beclin1
prevented autophagosome formation and killing by these
drug combinations. Over-expression of the chaperones
GRP78 and HSP27 both prevented PERK activation
and mTOR inactivation resulting in less autophagosome
formation and less cell killing [1, 2].
Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors)
are used to treat erectile dysfunction [10]. PDE5 is also
expressed in the wider vasculature and myocardium
[11]. Tumor cells can over-express PDE5, as has been
demonstrated in hepatoma, breast and NSCLC [7, 9].
PDE5 inhibitors have a well-established safety record
and have been shown to be safe in combination with most
other medications [12, 13]. The vast majority of studies
examining the molecular biology of PDE5 inhibitors
have been performed in vascular smooth muscle cells,
monocytes and cardiac tissue; not in tumor cells. PDE5
catalyzes the degradation of cyclic GMP (cGMP); i.e.
thus PDE5 inhibitors increase cGMP levels [reviewed
in 14]. The second messenger nitric oxide (NO) induces
smooth muscle relaxation via the actions of cGMP
[15–18]. NO at nanomolar levels binds tightly to a
heme group in NO-guanylyl cyclase (GC), also known

as soluble guanylyl cyclase, and causes a ~150-fold
activation of the enzyme. Activation of NO-GC elevates
cGMP levels, which initiates the cGMP signaling
pathway, in part through activation of cGMP dependent
protein kinase (PKG) [19, 20].
It is known in non-tumor cells that cGMP/PKG,
through its stimulatory actions upon the ERK1/2, p38
MAPK, JNK1/2 and NFκB pathways can increase the
expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
[21–23]. Thus increased levels of NO activate GC and
increase cGMP levels, that activates signaling pathways
which increase iNOS levels; and, increased iNOS levels
lead to further increases in cellular NO. i.e. potentially a
self-stimulatory pathway. One mechanism by which NO is
inactivated is by its reaction with the superoxide anion (O2) [24, 25]. Compared to non-transformed cells, tumor cells
generate greater amounts of O2-. The reaction of NO with
O2- forms the more potent oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO-)
that causes damaging S-nitrosylation of proteins and lipids
[26–30].
The present studies were designed to determine the
molecular mechanisms by which PDE5 inhibitors such as
sildenafil (Viagra) enhance the anti-tumor effects of the
standard of care drug pemetrexed in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).

RESULTS
Initial studies determined whether pemetrexed
and sildenafil interacted to cause enhanced cell killing.
To varying degrees, sildenafil enhanced the killing
potential of pemetrexed in a genetically diverse range of
lung cancer cells (Figure 1A and 1B). Similar data were

of pemetrexed and sildenafil for 24h. Cells were isolated and viability determined by trypan blue exclusion assay (n = 3 +/- SEM) # p <
0.05 greater than corresponding value in vehicle treated cells. B. NSCLC cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of pemetrexed
and sildenafil for 24h. Cells were isolated and viability determined by trypan blue exclusion assay (n = 3 +/- SEM) # p < 0.05 greater than

obtained using other clinically relevant PDE5 inhibitors,
tadalafil and vardenafil; the combination did not kill nontransformed cells in the same time-frame (Figure 2A).
After a transient exposure, pemetrexed and sildenafil
interacted in a synergistic fashion to kill lung cancer cells
in colony formation assays (Figure 2B).
Combined, but not individual, treatment of lung
cancer cells strongly increased the phosphorylation
of eIF2α S51, ATG13 S318, JNK and p38 whereas it
decreased the phosphorylation of AKT T308, p70 S6K
T389, mTOR S2448 and ULK-1 S757 (Figure 3A and
3B). These changes in phosphorylation were associated
with reduced expression of BCL-XL and MCL-1, and
increased expression of Beclin1. Expression of activated
forms of AKT, mTOR or p70 S6K significantly reduced
cell killing by [pemetrexed + sildenafil], as did inhibition
of JNK pathway signaling (Figure 3C). Inhibition of
p38 MAPK signaling did not alter the lethality of the
drug combination. [Pemetrexed + sildenafil] treatment
increased the phosphorylation of IκB and NFκB and
reduced total IκB expression (Figure 3D). Blockade of

NFκB signaling by expressing the super-repressor IκB
S32A S36A suppressed [pemetrexed + sildenafil] lethality
(Figure 3E). Pemetrexed, as a thymidylate synthase
inhibitor, causes DNA damage which will activate the
ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) protein [2]. The kinase
ATM that can signal through IKKγ (NEMO) to activate
NFκB; the drug-induced changes in NFκB and IκB
phosphorylation as well as expression were dependent on
ATM signaling (Figure 3F).
In agreement with the drug combination causing
elevated levels of Beclin1 and increased phosphorylation
of ATG13 S318; increased numbers of autophagosomes
were also detected in cells treated with [pemetrexed
+ sildenafil] (Figure 4A). Knock down of Beclin1 or
ATG5 reduced the lethality of [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
treatment (Figure 4B). Pemetrexed, via elevating ZMP
levels, promotes activation of the AMP-dependent
kinase (AMPK) [31, 32]. The AMPK phosphorylates
ULK-1 on S317 which causes ULK-1 activation [33].
Pemetrexed, and to a greater extent [pemetrexed +
sildenafil], increased both ULK-1 S317 and ATG13

Figure 2: Tadalafil and vardenafil also selectively enhance pemetrexed lethality in tumor cells. A. Lung cancer cells as

well as primary lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of pemetrexed, vardenafil, tadalafil and
sildenafil, as indicated in the panel. Twenty-four h after treatment cells were isolated and viability determined by trypan blue exclusion
assay (n = 3 +/- SEM) # p < 0.05 greater than the value in pemetrexed treated cells. B. NSCLC cells were plated in sextuplicate as single
cells in 100 mm dishes (250, 500, 1,000 cells per dish). Twenty-four h after plating cells were treated for 12h with vehicle control, sildenafil,
pemetrexed or the drugs in combination as indicated, at the indicated concentrations. After 12h the media was removed, the cells washed
and fresh media added that did not contain drugs. Upper: Ten days after treatment cells were fixed in place, stained with crystal violet,
and the number of colonies counted, with determination of changes in plating efficiency. The combination index (CI) for synergy was
determined using the Calcusyn for Windows program. (n = 2 in sextuplicate +/- SEM). Lower: Ten days after treatment cells were fixed
in place, stained with crystal violet, and the number of colonies counted, with determination of changes in plating efficiency (n = 2 in

S318 phosphorylation in an AMPK-dependent manner
(Figure 4C). Thus for ATG13 phosphorylation and hence
autophagosome formation to occur requires ULK-1
S757 dephosphorylation and increased ULK-1 S317
phosphorylation. In agreement with our ULK-1 S317
data, knock down of AMPK also significantly reduced
the ability of [pemetrexed + sildenafil] to increase
autophagosome levels and to cause tumor cell death
(Figure 4D and 4E).
Pemetrexed causes DNA damage which will
activate ATM [2]. Sildenafil, through generation of
nitric oxide would also be predicted to activate ATM.
Treatment of cells with [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
activated ATM as judged by increased phosphorylation
of ATM itself and histone γ2AX, and the lack of

γH2AX phosphorylation when ATM expression was
knocked down (Figure 5A). ATM has been proposed to
phosphorylate the AMPK on T172 and TSC2 on T1462.
In an ATM-dependent fashion, [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
increased the phosphorylation of AMPK T172, Raptor
S792 and TSC2 T1462. These findings correlated with
increased ULK-1 S317 phosphorylation. In an AMPKdependent fashion, [pemetrexed + sildenafil] increased
phosphorylation of Raptor S792 and TSC2 T1462
and decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR S2448
and S2481 (Figure 5B). The drug-induced decreased
phosphorylation of mTOR S2448, mTOR S2481 and
ULK-1 S757 was prevented by knock down of ATM
(Figure 5C). To our surprise, knock down of either ATM
or of AMPK also increased the basal phosphorylation

cell survival. A and B. H460 cells were treated with vehicle control, pemetrexed (1.0 μM), sildenafil (2 μM) or the drugs in combination
for 6h. Cells were fixed in place and immuno-fluorescence staining performed to determine the phosphorylation and expression of the
indicated proteins (n = 3 +/- SEM) # p < 0.05 greater than pemetrexed alone value; * p < 0.05 less than vehicle control value. C. NSCLC
cells were transfected with an empty vector plasmid (CMV) or with plasmids to express activated forms of AKT, mTOR or p70 S6K, or

treated with the JNK inhibitory peptide (10 μM). Twenty-four h after transfection cells were treated with vehicle control, pemetrexed
(1.0 μM), sildenafil (2 μM) or the drugs in combination for 24h. Floating cells were cytospun onto the 96 well plate and cell viability
determined using a live / dead viability stain. D. NSCLC cells were treated with vehicle control or with [pemetrexed (1.0 μM), sildenafil

cytospun onto the 96 well plate and cell viability determined using a live / dead viability stain. (n = 3 +/- SEM) # p < 0.05 less than value
in CMV transfected cells. F. NSCLC cells were transfected with a scrambled siRNA or with an siRNA to knock down ATM. Twenty-four
h after transfection cells were treated with vehicle control or [pemetrexed (1.0 μM) + sildenafil (2 μM)] in combination for 6h. Cells were
fixed in place and immuno-fluorescence staining performed to determine the phosphorylation and expression of the indicated proteins. (n

levels of mTOR S2448, mTOR S2481 as well as of
their downstream target ULK-1 S757. Low levels
of nitrosative stress have been shown to activate the
ATM-AMPK pathway in an LKB-1 -dependent fashion,
however as A549 and H460 cells do not express LKB1 this argues in our drug combination system LKB-1
is dispensable for AMPK activation which may be due
to pemetrexed increasing the levels of ZMP that will
allosterically activate the enzyme. One other possible
reason for this may be that in our system ATM activation
is induced by both pemetrexed-induced DNA damage
and by sildenafil-induced nitric oxide. To test whether
nitric oxide signaling facilitated ATM and AMPK

phosphorylation we knocked down the expression of
[iNOS + eNOS]. Inhibition of nitric oxide generation
reduced by ~50% to 100% the ability of [pemetrexed +
sildenafil] to increase ATM and AMPK phosphorylation
(Figure 5E). Collectively these findings imply that
[pemetrexed + sildenafil] induces an ATM-AMPK
signaling module which, through multiple overlapping
mechanisms, reduces mTOR activity and increases
ULK-1 activity, leading to toxic autophagosome
formation.
In addition to our findings in Figure 5, the
phosphorylation of AKT T308 and AKT T473 was
also variably enhanced by knock down of ATM or of

μM), sildenafil (2 μM) or the drugs in combination for 6h, 12h or 24h. At each time point the cells were visualized and the number of intense
punctate LC3-GFP bodies in each cell counted, with data acquired from at least 40 cells per condition, and the mean number of punctae per

= 3 +/- SEM) * p < 0.05 less than corresponding value in siSCR cells. E. NSCLC cells were transfected with a scrambled siRNA control

AMPK (Figure 6A). Treatment of NSCLC cells with a
clinically relevant concentration of the mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimus enhanced the lethality of [pemetrexed
+ sildenafil] (Figure 6B). Of note, sildenafil and
temsirolimus also interacted in a greater than additive
fashion to kill tumor cells. Knock down of mTOR also
enhanced the lethality of [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
(Figure 6C). Knock down of PKG or of iNOS/eNOS
prevented sildenafil interacting with temsirolimus to
kill tumor cells (Figure 6D). In Figure 5 we found that
knock down of ATM or of AMPK modestly enhanced the
activities of mTOR and AKT. Expression of dominant
negative AKT weakly and variably enhanced cell death
in tumor cells transfected to knock down the expression
of ATM or AMPK (Figure 6E). In contrast, knock down
of mTOR enhanced cell death in tumor cells transfected

to knock down the expression of AMPK, and to a lesser
extent than that caused by ATM knock down (Figure
6E).
As eIF2α was phosphorylated after drug
combination exposure, and autophagosome formation
enhanced, we next determined the relative importance
of the known endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling
pathways in the death and/or survival of tumor cells treated
with [pemetrexed + sildenafil]. Knock down of eIF2α,
ATF4 or CHOP reduced the lethality of [pemetrexed +
sildenafil] treatment (Figure 7A). Knock down of ATF6
neither enhanced nor suppressed [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
lethality. In contrast, knock down of IRE1 or XBP1
increased the lethality of pemetrexed and of [pemetrexed
+ sildenafil]. Knock down of IRE1 or XBP1 reduced
expression of the cyto-protective chaperones GRP78,

HSP27, HSP40, HSP60 and HSP70, with a cell-type
dependent reduction in HSP90 levels (Figure 7B). The
reduction in GRP78 levels was mirrored in the increased
phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α. Treatment of cells
with [pemetrexed + sildenafil] reduced the expression
of the cyto-protective proteins BCL-XL, MCL-1 and
c-FLIP-s, an effect that was blocked by knock down of
eIF2α (Figure 7C). In parallel the drug combination also
increased expression of Beclin1 that was prevented by
eIF2α knock down.
Over-expression of HSP90, HSP70, GRP78
and [HSP70 + GRP78], [HSP70 + HSP90] or [HSP70
+ HSP27] significantly reduced the lethality of
[pemetrexed + sildenafil] treatment (Supplementary
Figure S1A). Notably the combinations of [HSP70 +

GRP78] and [HSP70 + HSP27] in a cell-type dependent
fashion were able to further reduce cell killing
beyond that afforded by individual expression of the
chaperones. Over-expression of chaperones increased
the basal expression of Beclin1 and maintained
Beclin1 expression after [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
exposure (Supplementary Figure S1B). [Pemetrexed

BCL-XL, MCL-1 and c-FLIP-s that was preserved in
a cell-type dependent fashion by over-expression of
chaperones (Supplementary Figures S1C, S1D and
S1E). As shown in Figure 7C, knock down of eIF2α
prevented [pemetrexed + sildenafil] treatment reducing
BCL-XL, MCL-1 and c-FLIP-s levels; over-expression
of chaperones, alone or in combination, reduced the

drug combination-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α
(Supplementary Figure S1F). More noticeably were
the differential effects on autophagy gate-keeper kinase
mTOR phosphorylation, caused by chaperone overexpression; mTOR occurs in two protein complexes
termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. Phosphorylation of
mTOR at Serine 2448 is a biomarker for mTORC1
activity whereas phosphorylation of mTOR Serine
2481 is a biomarker for mTORC2 activity. Chaperone
over-expression consistently rescued mTOR S2448
phosphorylation (mTORC1) from the inhibitory effects
of [pemetrexed + sildenafil] exposure (Supplementary
Figure S1F). However, chaperone over-expression in
a cell type dependent manner only partially protected
mTOR S2481 (mTORC2) phosphorylation.
Additional modes of tumor cell killing were also
interrogated for any possible role in drug combination
lethality. Over-expression of a dominant negative
caspase 9 protein significantly reduced [pemetrexed +

sildenafil] lethality by ~50% whereas over-expression
of BCL-XL or c-FLIP-s reduced killing by > 75%
(Figure 8A). Knock down of apoptosis inducing factor
(AIF) or of RIP-1 also significantly reduced killing
by the drug combination in A549 and H1975 cells
though did not alter killing in H460 cells (Figure 8B).
Knock down of ULK-1 was uniformly protective.
Knock down of the death receptor CD95 or the death
receptor docking effector protein FADD significantly
reduced the ability of sildenafil to enhance pemetrexed
lethality (Figure 8C and 8D). Activation of eIF2α-CHOP
signaling has also been linked to increased expression
of the death receptors DR4 and DR5. Treatment of

and DR5 expression in an eIF2α-CHOP -dependent
manner (Figure 9A). Knock down of DR4 or DR5 in a

[pemetrexed + sildenafil] (Figure 9B).

The roles of cGMP and nitric oxide in the
regulation of pemetrexed toxicity were next investigated.
Combined knock down of PKGI and PKGII expression
significantly reduced the ability of sildenafil to enhance
pemetrexed toxicity (Figure 10A). Pan-inhibition of nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes using L-NAME also
significantly reduced the ability of sildenafil to enhance
pemetrexed lethality although this effect was significantly
less than that afforded by knock down of PKGI/II. We
then determine which NOS enzymes were responsible for
facilitating the sildenafil effect. We did not observe nNOS
expression in our lung cancer cells. In H1975 cells knock
down of eNOS, but not iNOS, reduced [pemetrexed +
sildenafil] lethality (Figure 10B). In H460 and A549 cells,
however, knock down of either iNOS or eNOS reduced

drug combination lethality. Prior studies with the drugs
AR12, sorafenib and pazopanib, alone or in combination
with sildenafil, demonstrated that they reduce the ATPase
activities of the HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone proteins
which correlates with altered tertiary conformation and
altered chaperone-client interactions [1, 2].
Treatment of cells with pemetrexed as a single
agent followed by chaperone isolation reduced the
in vitro ATPase activities of HSP90 and HSP70; an
effect that was enhanced by sildenafil (Figure 11A).
For HSP90 and HSP70 isolated from [pemetrexed
+ sorafenib] treated cells knock down of PKGI/II
prevented sildenafil enhancing the chaperone inhibitory
activity of pemetrexed whereas knock down of iNOS and
eNOS had no effect (Figures 11B, 11C and 11D). Knock

down of PKGI/II also significantly reduced the ability of
pemetrexed to suppress chaperone activities suggesting
that basal levels of PKG-mediated phosphorylation are
required to prime the chaperones for the pemetrexed
inhibitory effect. In H460 cells with HSP90 and in
A549 cells for HSP70, knock down of ATM reduced
the chaperone inhibitory effect of pemetrexed arguing
that ATM-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of
the chaperones was in part a mechanism by which
pemetrexed was reducing chaperone activity (Figure
12A). The activity of HSP90 can also be regulated by
acetylation. Treatment of NSCLC cells with pemetrexed
increased the acetylation of HSP90 (Figure 12B). In
A549 and H460 cells the combination of [pemetrexed
+ sildenafil] caused more acetylation than pemetrexed
alone (p < 0.05). HSP90 acetylation is regulated in part
by HDAC6. Treatment of NSCLC cells for 6h with
[pemetrexed + sildenafil] reduced the protein levels of
HDAC6, which correlated with the increased levels of
HSP90 acetylation we had observed (Figure 12B and
12C). Knock down of AMPKα or Beclin1 prevented
[pemetrexed + sildenafil] from reducing HDAC6

expression, arguing that HDAC6 was being eliminated
through a process involving autophagic digestion.
Finally, we determined whether pemetrexed and
sildenafil interacted in vivo to suppress lung tumor
growth. A transient three-day exposure of established
A549 tumors to pemetrexed and sildenafil significantly
reduced the rate of tumor growth compared to either
drug individually (Figure 13A). This was associated with
prolonged animal survival (Figure 13B). Very similar
data were obtained using the H460 lung cancer cell line
(Figure 13C). Based on our earlier data using an mTOR
inhibitor, we determined whether temsirolimus could
enhance [pemetrexed + sildenafil] lethality. The growth
of A549 cells was reduced by [pemetrexed + sildenafil]
that was significantly enhanced by the mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimus (Figure 13D). Finally, with a view to
performing future additional immunotherapy based
studies in immune-competent animals, we determined
whether [pemetrexed + sildenafil] altered expression of the
immuno-regulatory proteins PD-L1 and PD-L2 in NSCLC
cells. A 12h exposure to [pemetrexed + sildenafil] reduced
PD-L1 expression whilst that of PD-L2 remained constant

kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and pazopanib [5–9,
12, 13]. Clinical trials are also open at Massey Cancer
Center translating these discoveries with sildenafil
(NCT02466802, NCT01817751).
In 2012 Nagai et al demonstrated that increased
nitric oxide levels, via cGMP signaling, enhance
pemetrexed toxicity in lung cancer cells [36]. Based on
our prior data and the results of Nagai et al we attempted
to determine whether clinically relevant PDE5 inhibitors
such as sildenafil, that in endothelial cells via NO and
cGMP counter erectile dysfunction, could through the
same signaling pathway enhance pemetrexed toxicity in
lung tumor cells. PDE5 inhibitors in a diverse range of
lung cancer cell types significantly enhanced pemetrexed
toxicity using short-term death assessments and longterm colony formation assays. Although increased
signaling through nitric oxide was partially responsible

DISCUSSION
The present studies using the lung cancer
chemotherapy drug pemetrexed were based on the
foundation of our prior studies combining pemetrexed
with the multi-kinase and chaperone inhibitor
sorafenib [2, 34]. This concept has moved through
phase I evaluation and into phase II for triple negative
breast cancer patients [35] (NCT02624700). In
contemporaneous parallel studies we had discovered
that PDE5 inhibitors in an on-target -dependent fashion
could enhance the anti-cancer effects of many standard
of care chemotherapeutic drugs, but also of multi-

for sildenafil enhancing pemetrexed lethality, knock
down of PKGI/II almost abolished the enhancing effect.
The precise downstream targets for PKG signaling are
likely to be multi-factorial, and our present analyses
highlighted that PKG signaling, alongside enhanced
signaling by the AMPK, was responsible for the
inhibition of chaperone ATPase activities. Reduced
chaperone function in a tumor cell would facilitate
the inactivation of multiple cyto-protective signaling
modules such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and
lower expression of protective proteins with short halflives e.g. MCL-1 and c-FLIP-s, as well as facilitating
an unfolded protein response that promoted the
formation of toxic autophagosomes. Other possible proapoptotic targets for PKG signaling include inhibitory
phosphorylation of growth factor receptors e.g. c-MET;
the inhibition of β-catenin signaling; increasing the
expression of 15-LOX-1 with increased synthesis of
the bioactive metabolites 13-S-HODE and 15-S-HETE,

leading to activation of PPARγ [37–41]. This is of
particular note because 15-LOX-1 expression and
13-S-HODE levels are suppressed in lung cancer cells
and in other systems, sildenafil has been shown through
PKG to regulate PPARγ [42, 43]. It is also known
that PPARγ can regulate AMPK and eNOS signaling,
which in our system using pemetrexed and sildenafil
could be a point of convergence for the observed anticancer effects of both drugs [44]. Thus the combination
of the Type II diabetes medication rostiglazone with
erectile dysfunction drug sildenafil could be a novel
way to enhance the anti-tumor effects of maintenance
pemetrexed therapy in NSCLC.
Pemetrexed and sildenafil interacted to cause
endoplasmic reticulum stress as judged by increased eIF2α
serine 51 phosphorylation. Increased eIF2α signaling was
essential in the down-regulation of the cyto-protective
proteins c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL, as well as
the increase in Beclin1 expression and formation of

autophagosomes. However, in contrast to signaling from
eIF2α, knock down of IRE1 or XBP-1 enhanced the
lethality of [pemetrexed + sildenafil]. Reduced IRE1XBP-1 signaling increased the basal activities of PERK
and eIF2α and reduced the expression of multiple cytoprotective chaperone proteins as well as in a cell-type
dependent manner PP1c. These cyto-toxic effect were
counteracted by over expression of chaperone proteins.
The regulation of GRP78 expression by IRE1-XBP-1
signaling has been established for many years though
relatively fewer studies have determined whether this
signaling pathway controls the transcription of other
chaperone proteins. Nevertheless, XBP-1 signaling has
been linked to regulating the expression of GRP94 and
HSP40 as well as the p300/PCAF complex which will
regulate the function of many genes [45–50].

The molecular mechanisms by which tumor
cell death was induced by the drug combination were
complex (Figure 14). One component of killing was
via increasing the levels of toxic autophagosomes (see
below). However, another key component of cell killing
was through the activation of extant death receptors
(CD95) and PERK-eIF2α-CHOP -dependent increased
expression of other death receptors (DR4, DR5). In
a cell-type -dependent fashion knock down of CD95,
DR4 and DR5 variably prevented the drug combination
from killing; knock down of FADD was also protective.
Downstream of the receptors caspase 8/10 signaling
played a greater role in mediating the death signal than
did necroptotic signaling through RIP-1. The PERKeIF2α-dependent reduction in c-FLIP-s levels played a
key role in facilitating death signaling through caspases

8/10. Many investigators over the past 10-15 years
have attempted to develop DR4/DR5 as anti-cancer
therapeutic targets, e.g. using their natural ligand
TRAIL or using DR4/DR5 agonist antibodies. Although
TRAIL-DR4/DR5 signaling selectively kills tumor cells
over non-transformed cells, the clinical translation of
the ligand as a cancer therapeutic has not resulted in
significant patient responses. Agonist antibodies against
DR4/DR5 are presently being studied in the clinic. Our
data would suggest that the combination of [pemetrexed
+ sildenafil] together with such an agonist antibody may
have utility for the treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer.
As noted earlier, in parallel to the changes in
chaperone expression / function we also found that
the combination of [pemetrexed + sildenafil] caused
inactivation of the PI3K signaling pathway as judged by
reduced phosphorylation of AKT, p70 S6K and mTOR,
and activation of AMPK. We discovered that an ATMAMPK signaling pathway was induced by [pemetrexed +
sildenafil] exposure which was responsible for enhancing

the mTOR-inhibitory activities of TSC2 and Raptor.
Inactivation of mTOR reduces the phosphorylation of
the autophagy gate-keeper kinase ULK-1 at serine 757
which promotes kinase activation. Activation of AMPK
enhances the phosphorylation of ULK-1 at serine 317
which also promotes kinase activation. Our data argued
that for robust ATG13 serine 318 phosphorylation and
toxic autophagosome formation to occur, and thus lead to
tumor cell death, required both the inactivation of mTOR
and the activation of AMPK. Several groups have shown
that reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species
can activate ATM in the cytoplasm which in turn regulates
AMPK that phosphorylates TSC2 and Raptor, inactivating
mTOR, leading to a toxic form of autophagy [51, 52]. In
glioma cells treated with temozolomide, however, DNA
damage activated ATM also signals through AMPKULK-1 to promote a protective form of autophagy [53].
And, as pemetrexed increases ZMP levels, the enhanced
level of AMPK phosphorylation observed in our system
will further stimulate AMPK activity in an allosteric
fashion. Thus, [pemetrexed + sildenafil] exposure causes

a hyper-activation of the ATM-AMPK pathway through
the mechanisms of DNA damage, nitrosative stress and
ZMP accumulation which leads to toxic autophagosome
formation.
In two models of human NSCLC cells growing in
athymic mice we found that pemetrexed and sildenafil
interacted in an additive to greater than additive fashion to
suppress tumor growth. This effect was further enhanced in
vivo by the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. A549 cells express
a mutant active K-RAS and lack expression of p16; H460
cells lack p16, have a mutant active PI3K p110 protein and
a mutant active K-RAS. Both cell lines express mutated and
truncated LKB1. The H1975 line, used in our in vitro studies,
expresses a double mutant ERBB1; a mutant PI3K p110 and

lacks p16. We have also tested multiple other genetically
different NSCLC lines which include lines, e.g. H1573
that expresses a mutant active PI3K p85 protein. From in
vitro studies using primary non-transformed cells or H&E
staining of normal tissues from drug treated mice, as well
as examining alterations in mouse body-mass, we conclude
that [pemetrexed + sildenafil] treatment is well-tolerated
by non-transformed cells and animals under treatment.
Unfortunately, Massey Cancer Center has very recently
stated to the authors that it is uninterested in translating this
concept into the clinic as Massey traditionally has had poor
accrual to lung cancer trials and believes it would require too
many resources. It is hope other institutions act on the novel
data in this manuscript.

Figure 14: A simplified model of the molecular pathways by which pemetrexed and sildenafil combine to kill lung
cancer cells. As a thymidylate synthase inhibitor pemetrexed causes DNA damage and increases the levels of ZMP due to inhibition of

AICAR. Sildenafil, as a PDE5 inhibitor, increases the levels of cGMP which activates PKG and subsequently leads to the generation of
nitric oxide. Nitric oxide enhances the activation of ATM caused initially by DNA damage. ATM signals to activate the AMPK which is
further allosterically activated by ZMP. Collectively this strong AMPK signal inactivates RAPTOR and TSC2 resulting in the inactivation
of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Downstream of mTOR is the kinase ULK-1; the drug combination via AMPK promotes ULK-1 S317
phosphorylation which activates the kinase; the drug combination via mTOR inactivation reduces ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation which also
activates the kinase. Activated ULK-1 phosphorylates ATG13 which is the key gate-keeper step in permitting autophagosome formation.
Sildenafil-induced PKG signaling also acts to reduce the activities of multiple chaperone proteins which is augmented by DNA damage
induced ATM signaling. Reduced HSP90 and HSP70 function lowers the activities of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2 and AKT that results in
lower expression of ROS / RNS detoxifying enzymes such as TRX and SOD2. Reduced GRP78 function causes activation of PERK and
subsequently eIF2α. Enhanced eIF2α signaling reduces the transcription of proteins with short half-lives such as c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and
BCL-XL, and enhances expression of Beclin1, DR4 and DR5. Thus the convergent actions of reduced HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone
activity and eIF2α signaling lead to a profound reduction in the protein levels of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL which facilitates death
receptor signaling through CD95, DR4 and DR5 to activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Enhanced Beclin1 expression converges
with elevated ATG13 phosphorylation to produce high levels of autophagosome formation that, when fused with lysosomes and releasing
proteases into the cytosol, converges with the extrinsic apoptosis pathway to cleave BID and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Tumor cell
killing downstream of the mitochondrion was mediated by AIF and not caspases 3/7. The tumoricidal actions of AIF were facilitated by
reduced HSP70 functionality as this chaperone can sequester AIF in the cytosol and prevent its translocation to the nucleus.

and 10% (v/v) Non-essential amino acids. Cells growing in
“complete” fetal calf serum that contains thymidine were
gradually weaned into dialyzed serum lacking thymidine
over 2 weeks and were then used for experimental analyses
for the following 3 weeks before discarding. Cells were reisolated in thymidine-less media as required. Nota bene:
cell killing is reduced by > 50% if exogenous thymidine
is supplemented into the growth media. For short term cell
killing assays, immunoblotting studies, cells were plated at
a density of 3 x 103 per cm2 (~2 x 105 cells per well of a 12
well plate) and 48h after plating treated with various drugs,
as indicated. In vitro pemetrexed, sildenafil and other drug
treatments were generally from a 100 mM stock solution of
each drug and the maximal concentration of Vehicle carrier
(VEH; DMSO) in media was 0.02% (v/v). Cells were not
cultured in reduced serum media during any study in this
manuscript.

Animal studies
Studies were performed according to USDA
regulations under VCU IACUC protocol AD20008.
Athymic nude mice (~20 g) were injected with 1 x 107
A549 or H460 cells into their rear flank (10 animals per
treatment group; 4 groups; a total of 40 mice +/- SEM).
Tumors were permitted to form for 7 days with tumors at
that time exhibiting a mean volume of ~25 mm3. Athymic
mice were treated by oral gavage once every day QD for
four days as indicated in the Figure and Figure Legend
with vehicle (Cremophore); with pemetrexed (50 mg/
kg) only on day 1; with sildenafil (5 mg/kg) on days 1-3
and/or with Temsirolimus (10 mg/kg) on Days 1-3. After
cessation of drug treatment tumors are again calipered as
indicated in the Figure and tumor volume was assessed up
to 20-30 days later.

attach and grow for the next 18h. Based on the experiment,
after 18h, cells are then either genetically manipulated,
or are treated with drugs. For genetic manipulation,
cells are transfected with plasmids or siRNA molecules
and incubated for an additional 24h. Cells are treated
with vehicle control or with drugs at the indicated final
concentrations, alone or in combination. Cells are then
isolated for processing at various times following drug
exposure. The 96 well plate is centrifuged / cyto-spun to
associate dead cells (for live-dead assays) with the base
of each well. For live dead assays, after centrifugation,
the media is removed and cells treated with live-dead
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) and
after 10 min this is removed and the cells in each well are
visualized in the Hermes instrument at 10X magnification.
Green cells = viable; yellow/red cells = dying/dead. The
numbers of viable and dead cells were counted manually
from three images taken from each well combined with
data from another two wells of separately treated cells
(i.e. the data is the mean cell dead from 9 data points
from three separate exposures). For immuno-fluorescence
studies, after centrifugation, the media is removed and
cells are fixed in place and permeabilized using ice cold
PBS containing 0.4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton
X-100. After 30 min the cells are washed three times with
ice cold PBS and cells are pre-blocked with rat serum
for 3h. Cells are then incubated with a primary antibody
to detect the expression / phosphorylation of a protein
(usually at 1:100 dilution from a commercial vendor)
overnight at 37°C. Cells are washed three times with
PBS followed by application of the secondary antibody
containing an associated fluorescent red or green chemical
tag. After 3h of incubation the antibody is removed
and the cells washed again. The cells are visualized at
either 10X or 60X in the Hermes machine for imaging
assessments. All immunofluorescent images for each
individual protein / phospho-protein are taken using the
identical machine settings so that the levels of signal in
each image can be directly compared to the level of signal
in the cells treated with drugs. Similarly, for presentation,
the enhancement of image brightness/contrast using
PhotoShop CS6 is simultaneously performed for each
individual set of protein/phospho-protein to permit direct
comparison of the image intensity between treatments.
Antibodies used include: HSP90 (E289) (Cell Signaling);
HSP90 (#2928) (Abcam); HSP90 (ab195575) Abcam;
HSP90 3G3 (13495) (Abcam); GRP78 (50b12) (31772)
(Cell Signaling); GRP78 (ab191023) Abcam; GRP78
(ab103336) Abcam; GRP78 (N-20) (sc-1050) Santa Cruz;
HSP27 (G31) (2402P) Cell Signaling); HSP27 [EP1724Y]
(ab62339) Abcam; HSP27 (H-77) (sc-9012) Santa Cruz;
HSP27 (LS-C31836) Lifespan science Corp. Other
antibodies were as used in prior studies by the laboratory.
All immunofluorescent images were initially visualized at
75 dpi using an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor, Lincoln,
NE), then processed at 9999 dpi using Adobe Photoshop
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CS6. For presentation, immunoblots were digitally
assessed using the provided Odyssey imager software.
Images have their color removed and labeled figures
generated in Microsoft PowerPoint.

The measurement of chaperone ATPase activity
Chaperone ATPase activity using the ATPlite
1step kit (PerkinElmer) was determined using immunoprecipitated HSP90 and HSP70. The Sepharose beads
are equilibrated in the reaction buffer provided by the
manufacturer for 30 min with gentle mixing, and the
beads recovered by centrifugation. The beads are then
resuspended 1:1 with reaction buffer. To each well of a
96 well plate is added 50 μl of bead slurry and 50 μl of
substrate buffer solution containing vehicle control or drug
to achieve the desired final concentration. The reactions
are started using a multi-channel pipette delivering 50 μl
of reconstituted reagent to each well. The plate is placed
in foil in an orbital shaker at 37°C for 15 min. The plate is
removed; centrifuged to remove floating Sepharose beads;
and 100 μl of the supernatant from each well placed into a
new well in another 96 well plate. The light emitted from
each well / treatment condition is quantified using a Vector
3 plate reader (n = 3 of three studies +/- SEM).

Data analysis
Comparison of the effects of various treatments was
performed using one-way analysis of variance and a two
tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical examination of in vivo
animal survival data utilized log rank statistical analyses
between the different treatment groups. Differences with a
p-value of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Experiments shown are the means of multiple individual
points from multiple experiments (± SEM).
