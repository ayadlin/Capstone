ABSTRACT
Discovery of new drugs for cancer treatment is an expensive and time-consuming
process and the percentage of drugs reaching the clinic remains quite low.
Drug repositioning refers to the identification and development of new uses for
existing drugs and represents an alternative drug development strategy.
In this work, we evaluated the antitumor effect of metronomic treatment with a
combination of two repositioned drugs, metformin and propranolol, in triple negative
breast cancer models.
By in vitro studies with five different breast cancer derived cells, we observed
that combined treatment decreased proliferation (P < 0.001), mitochondrial activity
(P < 0.001), migration (P < 0.001) and invasion (P < 0.001). In vivo studies in
immunocompetent mice confirmed the potential of this combination in reducing tumor
growth (P < 0.001) and preventing metastasis (P < 0.05).
Taken together our results suggest that metformin plus propranolol combined
treatment might be beneficial for triple negative breast cancer control, with no
symptoms of toxicity.

INTRODUCTION

dynamics and toxicities, and because most repositioned
drugs are available at low cost, normally as generics [2]
which provides an opportunity to bypass partially the early
costs and time associated to new drugs development. This
is a particular issue for low-income countries, where the
availability of drugs for cancer treatment is very limited and
restricted to some essential cytotoxic drugs and cost is a
major factor in influencing access to cancer therapies [3].
Drug repositioning is frequently combined with
metronomic chemotherapy to what has been defined as
“metronomics” [3]. Metronomic chemotherapy refers to
the regular administration of conventional chemotherapy
drugs at low, minimally toxic doses, without long resting
periods of time [4]. Importantly, several phase II trials
have shown effectiveness of metronomic therapies on

Among breast cancer subtypes, triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) exhibit characteristics distinct from
the others, as they are particularly aggressive, frequently
recur and become metastatic. TNBC accounts for 15%
of all breast cancer types with higher percentages in
premenopausal African-American and Hispanic women,
and it is associated with very poor prognosis and limited
treatment options availability [1].
Drug repositioning refers to the assignation of new
uses for existing drugs and represents an alternative drug
development strategy. In oncology there is an increasing
interest in the use of non-cancer drugs for cancer treatments
due to the previous detailed knowledge of pharmacokinetics/

and Prop, on different models of TNBC both in vitro
and in vivo. We found that combined treatment was
effective on preventing cell growth, triggering apoptosis
and decreasing migratory/invasive capabilities of cells
in vitro, probably through their action on mitochondrial
bioenergetics. In a similar way, combined treatment
was able to reduce tumor growth in vivo, preventing
development of lung metastasis and increasing mice
survival, without symptoms of toxicity. These results
unveil a new combinatorial low-cost treatment with no
signs of toxicity for a type of tumors that normally have
limited treatment options paving the way for genuine
global oncology.

different cancer types including TNBC with different
drugs [5]. Interestingly, developed and approved drugs
that showed an anti-cancer opportunity for therapy can
be administered orally, on daily basis, in a metronomic
fashion.
The anti-diabetic metformin (Met) has been shown
to have anticancer properties involving both direct
(insulin-independent) and indirect (insulin-dependent)
actions. Retrospective studies have reported that patients
with diabetes receiving Met exhibited decreased cancer
incidence and cancer-related mortality [6–8]. These
studies were complemented with a growth-inhibitory
effect observed for Met on breast cancer cells in culture
and a reduction on mammary tumor growth in mice
[9, 10] and a synergistic action of Met with EGFR
inhibitors [11, 12]. Interestingly, Met was also found to be
effective against tumors expressing constitutively active
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase [PI3K; 13] and trastuzumabrefractory breast cancer xenografts [14]. Also, preliminary
results from clinical trials showed that Met administration
have an impact on tumor proliferation markers [15].
The indirect anticancer effect of Met involves
insulin dependent actions, associated with a reduction
of insulin circulating levels that lead to a decrease in
the mitogenic and antiapoptotic potential of insulin. In
this way, Met may diminish the pro-stimulatory effect
of insulin on cancer cells. Met direct effects are linked
to inhibition of mitochondrial complex I [16]. This
inhibition interrupts mitochondrial respiration, decreasing
proton-driven synthesis of ATP, causing cellular energetic
stress and elevation of the AMP:ATP ratio which, in turn,
activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key
cellular energy sensor kinase [10]. AMPK activation leads
to a reduction in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling, protein synthesis and proliferation [16–18].
Propranolol (Prop) is a noncardioselective
β-adrenergic receptor blocker with reported antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory properties, used traditionally for
hypertension, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction,
migraines, anxiety disorders, and tremor [19]. It was
previously shown that Prop reduces intracellular calcium
levels, Bax-mediated cytochrome C release and inhibits
protein kinase C (PKC) activity in a β-adrenoreceptor
independent manner [19–21], and it induces cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis via Akt/MAPK pathway in melanoma
cells [22]. Many studies in humans have demonstrated
its efficacy for the treatment of infantile haemangioma.
In this regard, it seems that Prop exerts its suppressive
effects acting through the HIF-1α-VEGF-A angiogenesis
axis, with effects mediated through the PI3K/Akt and
p38/MAPK pathways [23]. In relation to breast cancer,
retrospective studies reported an improved survival with
reduction in the risk of recurrence in woman receiving this
β-blocker therapy [24].
In this study we evaluated the effect of metronomic
combined administration of two repositioned drugs, Met

RESULTS
Met and Prop act synergically on breast tumor
cell lines viability
We first analyzed the effect of treatment with Met
and Prop on the growth of 5 different breast tumorderived cells. Both drugs were able to reduce cell
growth in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1A, 1B and
Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B) at different levels
in all the cells tested, as seen by colorimetric assays.
Noteworthy, combined treatment with Met  + Prop
showed a stronger effect on cell growth that single agent
treatment (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1C).
Interestingly, nor single or combined treatments caused
significant effects on non-tumoral cell line MDCK
(Supplementary Figure S1A–S1C). Dynamic monitoring
of cell proliferation using impedance technology
strengthened these observations. 4T1 cells growth
kinetics was slowed down by Met or Prop individual
treatment compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 1D).
Indeed, cell-doubling time determined before cell
confluence, was significantly (Met: P < 0.05; Prop:
P < 0.01) increased by those treatments (Figure  1E).
More importantly, combination of Met and Prop was
significantly more potent to reduce ability of 4T1 cells
to divide, showed by growth kinetics and doubling time
calculation (Figure 1D, 1E; Supplementary Figure S1D).
Drug cytostatic effects were further highlighted by 4T1
cell population stabilization from 16 h after starting
treatment (i.e. 40–88 h; Figure 1D). Combining Met
with Prop led to greater activity as shown by reductions
in slope values (Supplementary Figure S1E). Impedance
measurements in MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed that
combination of Met and Prop was effective leading to
a decrease in both growth kinetics and doubling time
(Figure 1F, 1G). Indeed, the combination was found
to act synergically on 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as
demonstrated by calculation of IC50 for each drug in the
presence of the other (Supplementary Figure S1F, S1G).
As Met and Prop administration to patients is
usually carried out on a “metronomic” manner, we decided

to explore if the continuous exposure to these drugs could
lead to stronger effects on cell proliferation. We compared
the impact on proliferation of short-term treatment
(approximately equivalent to a cell doubling time) and a
continuous 144 hours metronomic treatment. Calculations
of IC50 in these two conditions revealed that treatment with
Met and Prop in a metronomic basis increased drastically
(as example, Met IC50 values for 4T1 cells: from 5.8664 to
0.1656) cells sensitivity to these two repositioned drugs
(Table 1).
Treatment with Met and Prop also affected the
ability of 4T1 (Figure 2A, 2B and Supplementary
Figure  S2A) and MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary
Figure S2B) cells to form colonies, altering the number of
viable clones (Met+Prop, P < 0.001) and their size (Met
+ Prop, P < 0.001).
To further characterize the effect of Met and Prop
on viability, we evaluated the induction of apoptosis by

treatments. Both, Met and Prop increased significantly the
number of 4T1 and MCF7 apoptotic cells (Figure 2C, 2D
and Supplementary Figure S2C). Prop induced apoptosis
in MDA-MB-231 and M-234p-derived cells. In a similar
manner, Met alone promoted increase in apoptotic
population of M-406-derived cells (Supplementary
Figure S2C). Nevertheless, regardless the cell type or the
individual treatment effect, combination of drugs triggered
apoptotic response in all the cells tested, in significant
higher levels than any individual treatment (Figure 2C,
2D and Supplementary Figure S2C).

Combining Met to Prop leads to a strong
inhibition of mitochondrial bioenergetics
To assess the effect of treatment on mitochondrial
respiration in intact 4T1 cells, we performed realtime measurements of the oxygen consumption rate

were cultured in the presence of Met (5 mM) and/or Prop (5 µM) during 8 days. Colonies were visualized by Giemsa staining (A) in order to
allow quantification (B, top panel). Clones photos were taken at different times (A, lower panel) and their size was estimated by measuring
colonies diameters with the Image J software (B, bottom panel). (C, D) Analysis of the degree of apoptosis triggered by Met (5 mM) and/

(OCR). After a 4 h-incubation with Prop, cells showed
a basal respiration and a mitochondria-governed ATP
generation reduced by 35% and 33%, respectively, as
compared to control (Figure 3A, 3B). Met also induced a
noticeable dose-dependent decrease in both mitochondrial
respiration and ATP production, which reached -77% and
-83% respectively at 7.5 mM (Figure  3A, 3B). These
mitochondrial activities were completely abolished at
24 h, even with the lowest concentration of Met (-93%
respiration at 1 mM; Figure 3C). Importantly, the
mitochondrial inhibitory functions of Met were increased
by Prop (Figure 3A–3C). This was especially the case
for the lowest concentration of Met that, when combined
to Prop, further significantly reduced basal respiration
by 71% (Figure 3A) and respiration-linked ATP by 69%
(Figure 3B). When electron transport chain uncoupler
FCCP was added, mitochondrial respiration was stimulated
mimicking an increase in energy demand and showing the
maximal respiration rate (Figure 3D). In this case, the
combination between small doses of Met with Prop was
still more active than the two drugs alone to reduce 4T1
cells oxygen consumption rate (OCR). In line with this, the
spare capacity –defined as the difference between maximal
and basal respiration– was also significantly diminished
by the combinatorial treatment (P < 0.01; Figure 3E).
These results definitely demonstrated the potent antimitochondrial properties of the Prop/Met combination,
even at low concentrations.

(Figure  3H). Following addition of the ATP synthase
inhibitor oligomycin, cells treated with either vehicle, Prop
alone or Met alone exhibited higher ECAR (Figure 3H).
In contrast, the Met/Prop combinations –whatever
the concentrations used– forced 4T1 cells to activate
glycolysis up to the maximum extent, as revealed by their
insensitivity to oligomycin. Lastly, we represented 4T1
cell energy phenotype that comprises a baseline phenotype
(starting medium condition), a stressed phenotype
(mediated by FCCP for OCR and by oligomycin for
ECAR), and a metabolic potential (Figure 3I). This
last parameter reveals the cells’ ability, and preferred
energetic pathway, to respond to supplemental energy
demand due to stress. It confirmed that, when exposed to
the combinatorial treatment, 4T1 cells energy phenotype
dramatically changed, due to both treatment inhibitory
properties of mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation and
cells incapacity to further mobilize the glycolytic pathway.

Met and Prop affect metastasis related events
in vitro
In order to characterize properties of the cells related
to metastatic processes, we explored breast cancer cell
migration and invasion abilities in the presence of Met
and/or Prop. Both drugs significantly reduced (P < 0.01)
the migratory properties of 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells
in an in vitro wound-healing assay (Figure 4A–4E). In
addition, both drugs reduced the invasion efficiency of
4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a conventional assay
with matrigel, but only metformin did it significantly
(P < 0.01) for human cells (Figure 4F–4H). Furthermore,
as previously shown for growth and apoptosis, combined
treatment exacerbated migratory and invasive defects
triggered by treatments in both cell lines (Figure 4A–4F,
Supplementary Figure S3).

Met and Prop combination drastically activates
glycolysis
Cancer cells are known for their ability to shift
their metabolic phenotype. Taking into account the
inhibition of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
by Prop and Met, we then determined whether 4T1
cells in turn hyper-activated glycolysis. We therefore
measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)
that reflects lactate release over time. In this context,
we found that cells exposed to different doses of Met
for 4 h showed a dose-dependent increase in ECAR,
after glucose addition (Figure 3F). Prop treatment also
stimulated basal glycolysis, in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 3G). While its effect was limited after 4 h when
used alone, Prop significantly enhanced the pro-glycolysis
properties of Met, especially for the lowest concentrations

in vivo breast tumor growth affecting positively
mice survival
To confirm our in vitro findings, we examined the
effect of metronomic treatment with the drugs in two
models of TNBC: 4T1 and M-406. Drug dosage was based
on literature data and was associated with no toxicity. The
choice was based in articles using Met or Prop to treat

DISCUSSION

diabetes and hypertension respectively [25, 26]. Mice
treated with Met and/or Prop developed tumors which
showed a significant slower growth kinetics, as measured
by the decreased tumor volume when compared to the
control and the increased tumor doubling time (Figure 5A,
5C and Supplementary Figure  S4A, S4B). This
decrease in tumor growth also correlated with reduced
proliferation associated with treatments (P < 0.001), as
seen by immunostaining with Ki67 proliferation marker
(Figure  5E, 5F). The combined treatment was more
efficient in slowing down tumor growth (4T1: P < 0.05
from day 15; M-406: P < 0.05 from day 20; Figure 5A, 5C
and Supplementary Figure S4A, S4B), which is related to a
significant increase in apoptosis (P < 0.05; Figure 5G, 5H).
Combined treatment was also associated with a
significantly (P < 0.001) improved survival of mice
bearing both 4T1 and M-406 tumors (Figure 5B, 5D).
Interestingly, there were no signs of toxicity associated
with treatments as seen by analysis of mice weight
evolution (Supplementary Figure S4C, S4D) and general
behavior (data not shown).

TNBC represent from 10 to 20% of breast cancer
and is usually associated with poor prognosis and limited
treatment options [27]. Cancer therapies currently applied
cause significant side effects negatively impacting the
patient’s quality of life [28, 29]. Hence, there is an urgent
need to develop clinically effective and well-tolerated new
therapeutic approaches.
Met and Prop are being currently used to treat
diabetes and cardiovascular illnesses, both conditions
known as age-related diseases. Common cancer is also
considered an aging-related condition, so the use of antiaging repurposing drugs could be helpful to prevent or
treat cancer [30–32]. During the last decade Met has been
associated with a reduced incidence and severity of several
types of cancer, and retrospective studies suggested a benefit
of using ß-blockers for breast cancer patients [6–8; 33].
We report here that a combination of two
repositioned drugs, namely Met and Prop, was able to slow
down the growth of all the triple negative tumor cell lines
and tumor-derived cells tested. They also were effective on
the estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF7 cells. Indeed, in
all the cell types analyzed and regardless the method used,
combination of Met+Prop showed a significantly stronger
effect on cell growth than any individual drug. In fact, our
in vitro data with 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells revealed
that Met and Prop worked together in a synergistic
manner blocking proliferation as it can be easily seen by
the position of IC50 values falling below the additivity
curve. Interestingly, the combination of these two drugs
was effective not only to inhibit proliferation, but also
to diminish the clonogenic capability and to increase
apoptosis of the tumor cells.
In order to somehow mimic the metronomic
administration of drugs under study, we performed
proliferation assays in continuous presence of Met or
Prop. It was evident that constant administration of
low doses of Met and Prop had a stronger effect on cell
proliferation than a short-term exposure, as seen by the
drastic decrease (around 20 times for Met and 40 times for
Prop) on IC50 value for these drugs when metronomically
administered. This is not a special feature of these two
drugs, but rather a consequence of the administration
schedule. Indeed a stronger effect of topotecan and
pazopanib was also recently described when supplied

Combination of Met and Prop reduces
metastasis development
The examination of tumor-bearing animals, at the
end of the tumorigenesis assays, indicated that the number
of metastasis of M-406 cells to the lungs was significantly
decreased (P < 0.05) upon treatment with Met and Prop
(Figure 6A, 6B; Table 2). Nevertheless, there were no
significant differences in metastasis number at the end of
the experiment for 4T1 cells (Supplementary Figure S4E).
To further widen the analysis of the effect of
treatments on lung colonization properties by breast cancer
cells, we introduced M-406 or 4T1 cells intravenously
in recipient mice. Consistent with our previous finding,
we observed that breast cancer cells had impaired lung
colonization ability when mice were under combined
treatment (Figure 6C–6F), suggesting that treatments
are, at least, affecting post-intravasation steps during
metastasis process. Indeed, inspection of metastasis
evinced a reduced size for metastatic nodules when mice
were treated with Prop, either alone or in combination
with Met (Figure 6G, 6H), suggesting also an effect of
this β-blocker on the ability of cells to grow on lung
epithelium.

metronomically in breast cancer preclinical models [34].
To date, there is not clear correlation between in vitro Met
effective antitumoral doses and the concentration of this
drug observed in patient’s plasma [35, 36]. Nevertheless,
our observation of increased effectiveness (i.e. decrease
on IC50 values) for both Met and Prop when administrated
metronomically, together with their synergistic action,
allow us to speculate that metronomic administration of
this combined treatment could be effective at levels of Met
as low as the ones found in patient’s plasma.
Importantly, results from our in vivo experiments
in TNBC models corroborate the in vitro efficacy of the
combination. Animals receiving combined treatment
were indeed those with a slower tumor growth, for both

M-406 and 4T1 tumors. Moreover, Met+Prop treatment
improved survival of tumor bearing mice, which also
showed no signs of toxicity. This combinatorial treatment
thus endows with two important features: effectiveness
and lack of toxicity. Our data are in agreement with
a recent publication that reported the effectiveness of
combining Met and β-blocker atenolol in a mouse tumor
model [37]. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile mentioning
that the antitumor effect was achieved with atenolol doses
that were quite higher than those of Prop used herein.
This could be due to the action of propranolol on beta2 adrenergic receptors (ADRB2). Interestingly, it was
recently reported that Prop inhibits glucose metabolism
of breast cancer cells through ADRB2-dependent

posttranscriptional downregulation of hexokinase-2 [38].
It is also important to note that Prop is able to inhibit
M2 macrophages polarization, triggered by activation of
ADRB2 [39], an issue that could account for the reduced

tumor growth in immunocompetent mice which, however,
needs to be explored in more detail.
The antineoplastic activity of Met has attracted
the attention of many researchers. It has been found that

Met triggers cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and induces
apoptosis in a wide panel of breast cancer cell lines [40].
These effects are likely to be related to AMPK activation,
enzyme that senses redox and metabolic imbalance [41].
Conversely to what was initially hypothesized by Warburg,
it is now widely accepted that mitochondria are functional
in a large majority of tumors [42]. The discovery that
Met inhibits mitochondrial complex 1 activity in cancer
cells opened new horizons for biguanides in the field of
cancer metabolism. The mitochondrial effect is confirmed
in our study by OCR abolition in breast cancer 4T1 cells
and, consequently, by a severe reduction in mitochondriadriven ATP synthesis.
On the other hand, we showed here the antiproliferative properties of Prop in various breast cancer
cells, in agreement with our previous results in breast
carcinoma in vitro and in vivo models [43]. We contributed
to highlight the drug deleterious effects on mitochondrial
network functions and dynamics in various cancer cells
[44, 45], but Prop mechanism of action remained nonelucidated in breast cancer cells. Here, we showed that
Prop induces apoptosis in various breast cancer cell lines.
Moreover, we revealed that it disrupts bioenergetics

in intact cells, and especially through the inhibition of
respiration and ATP generation by mitochondria. Our
results are consistent with a very recent study showing that
atenolol inhibits the respiratory chain complex I in MDAMB-436 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells [37].
We further showed the efficacy of combining Prop
to low doses of Met to achieve a complete suppression
of the mitochondrial bioenergetics. Prop may thus
enhance the Met-mediated inhibition of mitochondrialdependent metabolic intermediates required for cell
growth and survival [16, 46]. Consistently, complete
abolition of mitochondrial respiratory activity has been
shown to prevent tumorigenesis in murine breast cancer
models [47] and to inhibit the in vivo growth of human
breast cancer cells [48]. The drop in mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation rate in cells exposed to the
Met+Prop combination led, in turn, to a noticeable
increase in glycolysis. The metabolic reprogramming
from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis is
generally described to support cancer cell proliferation and
tumor growth [49]. Nevertheless, previous studies have
demonstrated that Met can slow down cancer cell division
in presence of abundant amounts of glucose and induce

observed at the time of death to determine the presence of spontaneous metastasis (A, B). Mice were i.v. injected with 4T1 cells (C) or
M-406-derived cells (D). Fifteen days after injection lungs were stained with ink to allow metastasis quantification. Data are shown in a
box and whisker plot and represented as median, first and third quartiles, and maximum and minimum of all data (E: 4T1 cells; F: M-406derived cells). Metastatic nodes diameters were measured with a calliper (G: 4T1 cells; H: M-406-derived cells; C: control; M: Met (2 g/l);
P:Prop (25 mg/l); M+P: Met+Prop; n = 7).

cancer cell death in deprived glucose conditions [16, 50].
By enhancing glycolysis to an extraordinarily high rate,
the Met + Prop combination probably leads to glucose
deprivation in tumor cell microenvironment. Combining
these two stress-energy mimickers may thus first inhibit
cell proliferation and ultimately produce metabolic
synthetic lethality, as glucose levels decrease. Moreover,
the rapid glucose processing in Met-treated cells has been
suggested to result in the depletion of key glycolytic
intermediates [51], effect that could be intensified by the
combination with Prop. Indeed, it is important to note that
all the observed effects of Met and Prop on mitochondrialdependent metabolism could be associated with a putative
inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide production as
these drugs both inhibit mitochondrial complex I and
propranolol display antioxidant effects [19].
Progression of cancer is a dynamic process that also
requires the gain of invasive and migratory capabilities. A
proof-of principle epidemiological pilot study highlighted
that β-blockers reduce distant metastasis in breast cancer
patients [52]. Recent studies showed that these drugs
could decrease the pro-migratory effect of β-adrenergic
receptors [53] and inhibit cell scattering by enhancing cellcell adhesion [54] in breast cancer models. In the present
study, we observed that the combination of Met + Prop
altered breast cancer cell abilities to migrate and invade
in vitro. Consistently, Met + Prop combination was highly
efficient in preventing metastatic spreading in vivo, by
diminishing the seeding capacity and the cell growth at the
secondary tumor sites. This treatment feature is extremely
important, as the main cause of mortality in patients with
breast cancer is the development of metastasis and the
scarcity of therapeutic options.
There is increasing evidence that metabolic
plasticity is a major driver of cancer metastasis. While
the aerobic glycolysis has long been thought to be linked
to the metastatic potential of tumors, recent studies
demonstrate that OXPHOS is indispensable for tumor
migration and metastasis (extensively reviewed in [55]).
Disseminating breast cancer cells indeed display increased
levels of mitochondrial respiration [56]. The ability of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Met + Prop combination to inhibit rapidly and efficiently
the mitochondrial bioenergetics thus likely underlies the
strong anti-metastatic properties of the treatment. Of note,
this therapeutic strategy could especially be important to
prevent breast cancer brain metastases, in which enhanced
oxidative metabolism is associated with strongly increased
tumor cell survival and proliferation [57].
Taking all together, our results indicate that the
combination between Met and Prop is particularly
effective in two different triple-negative, syngeneic
breast cancer models, causing a significant metastasisfree prolonged survival with a favorable toxicity profile.
This strongly suggests the possibility of using these
repositioned drugs combination for the treatment of triplenegative metastatic breast cancer. As a matter of fact, it
would be extremely interesting to test the benefits of such
a combination when using as an adjuvant treatment after
surgery in order to prevent metastasis development and/or
recurrences or even as a perioperative therapy during the
surgical resection of tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
All cells were incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2. 4T1
cells were kindly provided by Dr. N. Zwirner (IBYMECONICET). M-406 and M-234p derived-cells were
obtained by disruption of tumors as described before [58].
These cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (10 μg/ml), and
streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were
kindly provided by Dr. G. Gil (CIQUIBIC-CONICET) and
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
penicillin (10 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

Proliferation

Aldrich) and their combination on breast cancer cells,
5 × 103 cells/well were plated on 96-well culture plates.
After attachment, different concentrations of Met and/
or Prop were added and cells were allowed to grow
for 24 hours. The number of living cells was estimated
indirectly by tetrazolium salts reduction method (WST-1,
Sigma Aldrich) as described by the manufacturer. The
amount of formazan dye formed directly correlates to
the number of metabolically active cells in the culture.
Proliferation was expressed as the percentage of control
untreated samples.
The concentration of drugs that decreased cell
proliferation by 50% (IC50) as compared to controls was
calculated using experimental data with the ED50plus
v1.0 program. To determine IC50 values on metronomic
treatment, cells were plated in 24-well plates (103 cells/well)
and allowed to attach. Cells were treated with Met or
Prop continuously for 144 h in 0.1 ml of medium, adding
fresh medium and drug every 24 h to mimic continuous
metronomic treatment [59].

A wound was performed with a yellow tip on
subconfluent 4T1 or MDA-MB-231 cells (time 0).
Cellular motility was estimated by measuring closure
of the initial wound. Photos were taken at the indicated
times and quantification of healing was performed using
the Image J software. Areas under the curve values were
determined as described [60]. To analyze cellular motility
in non-proliferative conditions, cells were put on media
supplemented with 0,1% FCS overnight, and maintained
under this condition during the whole assay.

Invasion assay
In vitro cell invasion assays were performed in 10-mm
diameter and 8 μm pore polycarbonate filter transwell
plates (Millipore). Membranes were pre-coated with
20 μg of matrigel (BD Biosciences) on the upper surface,
which formed a reconstituted basement membrane at
37°C. Cells (8 × 105 in 100 μL media + 1% FBS) were
seeded onto the upper well of the chamber, and the lower
well was filled to the top (600 μL) with media + 10%
FCS as chemoattractant. Treatments (Met 5 mM and/or
Prop 5 µM) were added to both upper and lower media.
After 24  hours incubation, cells were fixed in formalin
and stained with Giemsa. Non-migrating cells were then
carefully removed from the upper surface of the transwell
with a wet cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to or
invaded the bottom surface of the filter were counted. Six
evenly spaced fields of cells were counted in each well
using an inverted phase-contrast microscope.

Impedance measurements of cell proliferation
Impedance-based real time detection of
cell proliferation and viability was done using the
xCELLingence technology of the RTCA SP system
(ACEA Biosciences, Ozyme, France). 4T1 or MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells were seeded in E-Plate 96-well
plates (5 × 103 cells/well) for 24 hours, and were treated
with metformin 1–7.5 mM alone, propranolol 10  µM
alone, or their combinations. At cell seeding and after drug
administration impedance changes were monitored every
5 minutes for 8 hours, and every 15 minutes for the rest
of the experiment. Cell index (CI) values derived from the
recorded impedance data, were normalized (NCI) using
the RTCA Software 2.0 (ACEA Biosciences, Ozyme,
France). Data of each single well were normalized to
the first measurement after starting treatment using the
equation NCI(time) = CItime/CInml time.

Real-time analysis of energetic metabolism
Multiparameter metabolic analysis of intact cells
was performed in the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux
analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA).
4T1 cells were seeded in XF24 V7 24-well plates
(1.5 × 104 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37°C in
5 % CO2. Cells were then treated with metformin and/or
propranolol for 4, 24 or 48 hours prior to the assay. To
measure the glycolytic activity, cell culture medium was
replaced for 1 h with minimal DMEM (0 mM glucose)
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, pH 7.4. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)
was measured after sequential injections of glucose
(10 mM), of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin
(1 µM), and of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose
(100 mM). To measure the mitochondrial activity, the
same assay medium was used and supplemented with
10 mM glucose. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was
analyzed under these basal conditions and after sequential
injections of oligomycin (1 µM), of the electron transport
chain uncoupler FCCP (1 µM) and of specific inhibitors

Clonogenic efficiency
Cells (500/well) were plated on 6-well plates. After
attachment, they were cultured in the presence of Met
(5 mM) and/or Prop (5 µM) during 8 days. Photos of the
clones were taken at different times and their size was
estimated by measuring colonies diameters with the Image
J software. After fixing the cells with formalin (4% PBSbuffered p-formaldehyde (Anedra)), colonies were stained
with Giemsa to allow quantification.

Apoptosis
After 24 hours of treatment with Met (5 mM) and/or
Prop (5 µM), cells were collected, washed and stained with
Annexin V-FITC (AP-Biotech) and Propidium Iiodide.
Apoptotic rates were determined by flow cytometry.

with H&E. For immunohistochemical staining, paraffinembedded sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal
antibody to Ki67 (Leica Biosystems, 1:50 dilution). After
overnight incubation, tissue slides were rinsed with PBS,
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Vectastain
Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, USA), developed with
3,3´-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and counterstained with
hematoxilin. Quantification was done in a blind fashion
by counting positive cells in 10 fields (400X). Apoptotic
cells were detected with the TUNEL-based In Situ Cell
Detection Kit (In situ cell death fluorescein, Sigma):
Sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and digested with
proteinase K (Dako) for 30 min at 37°C and then subjected
to the TUNEL reaction according to the manufacturer’s
instructions; TUNEL-positive cells were visually scored
with a standard immunofluorescence microscope (CTR600,
Leica) and counted blindly in 8 fields (400X) chosen at
random.

Animal experiments
Six to eight-week-old inbred BALB/c and CBi
female mice were obtained from our breeding facilities.
Animals were fed with commercial chow and water
ad libitum and maintained in a 12 h light/dark cycle.
The animals were treated in accordance to the Canadian
Council on Animal Care guidelines. Tumor bearing
mice were euthanized by CO2 exposure. CBi mice were
described before [58].
To carry out 4T1 primary breast cancer
tumorigenesis analysis, 5 × 103 viable cells were
resuspended in PBS (100 μl) and injected orthotopically
into the fourth right mammary gland of the recipient
mouse. For M-406 tumorigenesis, a tumor fragment of
around 1 mm3 was orthotopically implanted in the fat pad,
in the right mammary flank. Three days later, animals
(N = 5–8/group) were distributed and treated as follows:
Control: regular drinking water; Met: Met in drinking
water (400 mg/kg BW/day); Prop: Prop in drinking water
(7 mg/kg BW/day); Met × Prop: Met + Prop treatments
combined. Primary tumor growth was analyzed by
measuring tumor length (a) and width (b) with a caliper,
and by calculating tumor volume (V) with the formula
V = 0.4ab2. Fitting to exponential growth and tumor
volume doubling times were calculated with the Prism
6 software. Metastatic dissemination of tumor cells was
quantified de visu after sacrificing the mice and at the same
time tumors were extracted, fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
and embedded in paraffin for hematoxylin/eosin staining.
To highlight metastatic nodes, lungs were stained as
described later on.
To carry out direct lung colonization assays, either
5 × 104 4T1 cells or 2 × 105 M-406 cells were resuspended
in 100 μl PBS and injected into the lateral tail vein. After
2 wk, mice were euthanized, the chest cavity was exposed
through a midline chest incision, the trachea cannulated
with a 20-gauge needle, and lungs slowly inflated using
1 ml of India ink (Pelikan, 1:16 dilution in PBS). Lungs
were then extracted, immersed in Fekete’s solution
(100 ml 70% ethanol (Cicarelli), 10 ml 4% formaldehyde
(Anedra), and 5 ml 100% glacial acetic acid (Cicarelli)) to
destain and metastatic nodules counted de visu.

Statistics
Data obtained in lab experiments were analyzed
using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparison
tests, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-test, and Logrank test were used to examine the differences between
groups with GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA). Unless otherwise indicated,
results are expressed as mean ± sem of three independent
experiments. P values lower than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
