ABSTRACT
Disulfiram (DS), a clinically used drug to control alcoholism, has displayed
promising anti-cancer activity against a wide range of tumors. Here, we demonstrated
that DS/copper (Cu) complex effectively eliminated adult B-ALL cells in vitro and
in vivo in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) humanized mouse models, reflected
by inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, suppression of colony
formation, and reduction of PDX tumor growth, while sparing normal peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. Mechanistically, these events were associated with disruption of
mitochondrial membrane potential and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Further analysis on B-ALL patients’ clinical characteristics revealed
that the ex vivo efficacy of DS/Cu in primary samples was significantly correlated
to p16 gene deletion and peripheral blood WBC counts at diagnosis, while age, LDH
level, extramedullary infiltration, status post intensive induction therapy, immune
phenotype, risk category, and Ph chromosome had no effect. Together, these findings
indicate that disulfiram, particularly when administrated in combination with copper,
might represent a potential repurposing agent for treatment of adult B-ALL patients,
including those clinically characterized by one or more adverse prognostic factors.

(DFS) [3–5]. Among others, severe adverse events that
threaten the lives of adult, especially elderly, patients
with ALL represent the major hindrances to the highdose multi-agent combination chemotherapy regimens.
Therefore, new therapeutic approaches with high efficacy
but low toxicity are urgently needed to treat adults with
ALL, in order to improve their long-term DFS as well as
overall survival.
Disulfiram (DS), a member of the dithiocarbamate
family, is an FDA-approved drug that has been clinically
used as an alcohol-abuse deterrent for more than six

INTRODUCTION
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a clinically
and biologically heterogeneous disorder [1, 2]. Despite
the introduction of the first-line therapy, including highdose multi-agent combination chemotherapy (increasingly
inspired to pediatric principles), hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, and new targeted therapy, which has
significantly improved overall survival rate (approximately
85%) of pediatric ALL patients, only about 30-40% of
adults with ALL achieve long-term disease-free survival

decades [6, 7]. In contrast to conventional chemotherapy
agents, it exhibits low toxicity, while easily available and
inexpensive. DS, as a strong metal-ion chelating agent,
interacts with copper (Cu) to form the Ds/Cu complex with
enhanced anti-tumor activity [8–10]. Recently, several
studies have demonstrated that DS is highly effective
against various types of solid tumors such as breast cancer
[11–13], melanoma [9, 14, 15], and prostate cancer [16],
as well as hematological malignancies, including ALL
[17–19].
Apoptosis, known as type I programmed cell death,
plays a critical role in development and homeostasis
of organisms [20, 21]. There are two major apoptotic
signaling
cascades,
the
mitochondria-mediated
intrinsic pathway and the death receptor-mediated
extrinsic pathway. The former is often considered
as the classic apoptotic pathway, which is initiated
with mitochondrial injury (e.g., loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential), resulting in mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and thus release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm where it
forms apoptosome with Apaf-1 to cleave/activate caspase
9, followed by cleavage/activation of the executioner
caspase-3, ultimately inducing apoptosis [22, 23, 24].
Currently, it remains to be defined whether and by
what mechanism(s) DS/Cu would be active against adult
B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Here
we report that DS/Cu is significantly and selectively
cytotoxic in vitro against human B-ALL cell lines and
primary samples obtained from adults with B-ALL,
particularly those carrying adverse prognostic genetic
abnormalities (e.g., p16 deletion), as well as effective in
vivo in B-ALL patient-derived xenografts, in association
with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, at least
in part, due to down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.

We next examined whether DS with or without
Cu induce apoptosis in B-ALL cell lines. To this end,
after exposed to various indicated concentrations of
DS in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM Cu for 24 hrs,
flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V/PI double
staining was performed to determine the percentage of
apoptotic cells. In both Nalm6 and REH cells, Cu (0.5
µM) administrated alone was unable to induce apoptosis
(P>0.05 vs untreated control; see below Figure 1D).
However, whereas ≥0.1 μM DS alone had significant
effects, treatment with DS at different doses (0.025, 0.05,
0.1, 0.2 μM) in combination with 0.5 μM Cu for 24 hrs
resulted in significantly increased apoptosis in a dosedependent manner in Nalm6 cells (Figure 1B; P<0.05 for
each DS dose, DS/Cu vs either untreated control or DS
alone). Comparable phenomena were observed in REH
cells (Figure 1C; P<0.05 for each DS dose, except 0.025
µM, DS/Cu vs untreated control or DS alone). In addition
to marked increases in overall percentage of Annexin V+
apoptotic cells when compared DS/Cu with DS alone,
representative flow cytometric data also demonstrated that
whereas DS (≥ 0.1 µM) by itself predominantly induced
early apoptosis (Annexin V+/PI−, lower/right quadrant Q3;
Figure 1D, top panels), co-treatment (24 hrs) with DS (≥
0.05 µM) and Cu (0.5 µM) resulted in robust increases
in both early and late apoptosis (Annexin V+/PI+, upper/
right quadrant Q2; Figure 1D, bottom panels). However,
exposure to neither DS nor DS/Cu resulted in necrosis
(Annexin V−/PI+, upper/left quadrant Q1). Taken together,
these results indicate that whereas DS itself is active
against B-ALL cell lines, combined administration with
non-toxic concentrations of Cu (e.g., 0.5 µM) remarkably
potentiates cytotoxicity of DS, primarily via induction of
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.

DS/Cu preferentially induces apoptosis of
primary adult B-ALL cells, but not normal
PBMCs

RESULTS
DS/Cu exhibits dose-dependent cytotoxicity in
human B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cell lines

We then tested activity of DS/Cu in primary samples
(bone marrow mononuclear cells) obtained from adults
with B-ALL. Clinical characteristics of these B-ALL
patients are summarized in Table 1 (also see Supplemental
Table S1 for details). Consistent with the anti-leukemia
activity of DS/Cu observed in B-ALL cell lines, cotreatment (24 hrs) with ≥ 0.05 µM DS and 0.5 µM Cu
resulted in significant increases in apoptosis of primary
B-ALL cells (P<0.001 vs untreated control, n=32; Figure
2A), although the responses varied among patients.
Regardless of the marked differences in basal levels of
spontaneous cell death among these primary samples,
average net increases in percentage of apoptotic cells were
7.16% 20.14% 29.52% 36.01% for 0.025, 0.05, 0.10 and
0.20 µM DS in combination with 0.5 µM Cu, respectively,
while only 1.29% for Cu alone (Table 2). Of note, identical
treatments with DS/Cu displayed minimal toxic towards

First, we examined the cytotoxic effect of DS/Cu on
two human B-ALL cell lines (i.e., Nalm6 and REH) using
the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). As shown in Figure 1A,
while treatment with Cu alone had no significant effect on
cell proliferation (inhibition rate=6.39±4.93%, t=-2.244,
P=0.154 vs untreated control; not shown), exposure to a
series of the indicated concentrations of DS coupled with
0.5 μM Cu (DS/Cu) for 24 hrs significantly inhibited
proliferation of Nalm6 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(P<0.05 for each condition vs untreated control), with
IC50 values of 0.18±0.08 µM. Analogous results were
obtained in another B-ALL cell line, REH (Figure 1A;
P<0.05 for each condition vs untreated control), with IC50
values of 0.243±0.256 μM.

normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
obtained from healthy donors of hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT, Figure 2B and Table 2). These
findings argue that DS/Cu might selectively eliminate
B-ALL cells, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells,
in consistence with low-toxicity of DS as a safe antialcoholism drug.

DS/Cu against primary B-ALL cells, we analyzed the
potential relationship between patients’ characteristics
and the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by a series
of concentrations of DS in combination with 0.5 μM Cu.
According to the NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2015 Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, high risk is generally defined as
having any of the following poor-risk cytogenetic factors:
hypodiploidy (<44 chromosomes); t(v;11q23) or MLL
rearrangements; t(9;22) or BCR-ABL gene mutations;
or complex karyotype (≥5 chromosomal abnormalities),
while the absence of all poor-risk factors is considered
standard risk.
Of total 32 patients enrolled in this study, median
age was 27.5 years (range, 15-61 years); 11 (34.4%)
were age ≥ 35 years; median peripheral white blood cell

risk category, Ph chromosome, etc.) did not significantly
affect response of primary B-ALL cells to DS/Cu (P>0.05
for each of these parameters). These results raise a
possibility that adults with B-ALL carrying certain adverse
prognostic genetic abnormalities (e.g., p16 gene deletion)
might be particularly susceptible to the DS/Cu regimen.

and primary B-ALL cells. As shown in Figure 4, treatment
with DS in combination with Cu (0.5 μM) significantly
reduced JC-1 up-take by Nalm6 (Figure 4A) and REH
cells (Figure 4B; P<0.05 for DS at doses ≥ 0.05 μM,
compared to untreated control, in both cell lines), of which
representative data is shown in Figure 4C, consistent with
induction of apoptosis (Figure 1B and 1C). Significantly,
exposure (12 hrs) to DS/Cu also dose-dependently induced
loss of ∆Ψm in primary B-ALL cells (Figure 4D, P<0.05
for DS at doses ≥ 0.1 μM, compared to untreated control,
n=6), isolated from the adults with B-ALL as marked
in Supplemental Table S1. Furthermore, Western blot
analysis revealed that whereas DS alone (24 hrs) modestly
down-regulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL, these effects of DS was markedly enhanced in
the presence of Cu, accompanied by increased caspase-3
cleavage (activation) and PARP degradation (Figure 4E).
Together, these findings suggest that DS, particularly in
combination with Cu, acts to induce cell death of adult
B-ALL cells primarily via activation of the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway, at least in part, due to down-regulation
of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 and
Bxl-xL).

DS/Cu suppresses colony formation of B-ALL
cells
Clonogenic assays were carried out to investigate
the ability of DS/Cu to induce “reproductive death” in
B-ALL cells. As shown in Figure 3, while treatment with
Cu (0.5 μM) had no effect (P>0.05 vs untreated control),
treatment (6 hrs) with DS (0.05 μM) alone markedly
reduced colony number in Nalm6 cells (P<0.01 vs
untreated control). Of note, combined treatment with DS
and Cu (6 hr prior to plating) almost completely abolished
the colony-forming ability of Nalm6 cells after cultured
for 10-14 days (P<0.01 and P<0.05 vs untreated control
and DS alone, respectively). These results indicate that DS
is able suppress clonogenicity of B-ALL cells, an event
dramatically enhanced by co-administration of Cu.

DS/Cu induces loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway, in association with down-regulation of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL

DS/Cu is active in vivo in patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models of adult B-ALL
Last, in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy of DS/Cu was
examined in patient-derived xenograft models of NODscid-IL2Rg-/- (NSI) mice, generated from the primary
sample of an adult B-ALL patient with p16 deletion. Cu
and DS were administered by oral gavage in the morning
and afternoon respectively, from Monday to Friday for

To further investigate the mechanism of action for
DS/Cu to kill B-ALL cells, mitochondrial membrane
potential (∆Ψm) was analyzed by flow cytometry using
the ∆Ψm probe JC-1 in both cultured B-ALL cell lines

displayed a substantial delay in tumor growth, manifested
by appearance of human CD45+ cells in peripheral blood

Consistently, co-administration of DS/Cu remarkably
reduced tumor burden in the B-ALL PDX models,

histopathology after 5 weeks following transplantation
revealed a remarkable reduction in infiltration of leukemic
cells, accompanied by well preserved normal tissue
architecture, in the spleen, bone marrow, lung, liver, and
kidney of the PDX mice receiving DS/Cu, compared to
control mice (Figure 5F). Finally, immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining demonstrated that treatment with DS/Cu
clearly down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
in bone marrow of the PDX mice (Figure 5G), consistent
with the in vitro observation that DS/Cu activated the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Figure 4E). Together, these
findings argue strongly that the DS/Cu regimen is highly
active in vivo in adult B-ALL PDX models.

for Cu recommended dietary intake [19]. Thus, the doses
of DS and Cu that were effective against B-ALL cells
fall within these low- or non-toxic dose range of these
agents. Indeed, while exposure to 0.05-0.2 µM DS with
0.5 µM Cu was highly active to induce apoptosis in both
B-ALL cell lines and primary adult B-ALL cells in a dosedependent manner, treatment with the identical doses
(i.e., ≤ 0.2 µM) of DS with 0.5 µM Cu displayed only
minor toxicity towards normal cells. Moreover, whereas
DS administrated alone had clear effects on B-ALL cells,
combined treatment with non-toxic doses of Cu (e.g.,
0.5 μM) dramatically enhanced activity of DS, including
markedly increased induction of apoptosis and suppression
of colony formation in B-ALL cells. Moreover, the latter
also provides evidence for the capability of DS/Cu to
impair clonogenicity of B-ALL cells. Notably, DS/Cu
was also highly active in vivo in PDX models of adult
B-ALL, which were developed using humanized NSI
mouse [25, 26], including substantial delay of tumor
growth, reduction of tumor burden, and attenuation of
leukemic cell infiltration in multiple organs (e.g., spleen,
bone marrow, lung, liver, and kidney). Taken together,
these in vitro and in vivo findings argue strongly that DS,
especially when administrated in combination with Cu,
might represent an effective repurposing regimen for the
treatment of adult B-ALL.
It is well established that the therapeutic response
and prognosis of patients with ALL are significantly
influenced by multiple risk factors, including age, WBC
count at the time of first diagnosis, extramedullary
infiltration, cytogenetic abnormalities, etc. [27–31]
Moreover, high-risk diseases are associated with greater
incidence of chemo-resistance, higher rate of relapse, and
lower rate of survival. To this end, we further analyzed
the relationship between clinical characteristics and antitumor activity of DS/Cu in their primary samples obtained
from 32 adults with B-ALL. Interestingly, we found
that the ex vivo cytotoxicity of DS/Cu was significantly
associated with peripheral WBC count at diagnosis and
p16 gene deletion, but not other clinical features such
as age, LDH value, extramedullary infiltration, status at
day 14 and 28 after intensive induction therapy, immune
phenotype, risk category, and Ph chromosome. While
the mechanisms underlying such correlations between
therapeutic responses to DS/Cu and WBC counts or
p16 deletion remain to be explored in successor studies,
these findings might provide initial evidence for future
development of the DS/Cu regimen as personalized
treatment of adult B-ALL.
Several mechanisms have been reported for
induction of apoptosis by DS/Cu in cancer cells, including
production of reactive oxygen species [10], inhibition of
proteasome activity [11], regulation of transcription factors
(e.g., NF-κB), and activation of the stress-related JNK
signaling pathway [17, 18]. It has also been demonstrated
that DS/Cu cytotoxicity may attribute to modulation of the

DISCUSSION
Evidence has been emerging on identifying new uses
for existing drugs, termed repurposing or repositioning, as
an accelerated way for drug development. Repositioning
existing drugs could increase productivity of drug
development by shortening the process from laboratory
investigation to clinical application due to their easy
availability and known safety or toxicity profile. DS, also
known as Antabuse, has been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of alcohol
abuse and dependence (alcoholism) for more than six
decades. Recently, repositioning DS for new indications
has attracted a lot of attention in treatment of cancer.
The anti-cancer activity of DS, particularly in a form of
coupling with Cu (DS/Cu), has been demonstrated in a
variety of cancers. For example, Conticello et al. have
reported that primary cells isolated from patients with
various hematological malignancies, including multiple
myeloma (MM), acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), were significantly sensitive to DS alone
or in combination with Cu [19]. Consistently, the present
studies have further validated the anti-leukemia activity
of DS/Cu in vitro in B-ALL cell lines and especially in
primary samples obtained adults with B-ALL. Of note, in
vivo efficacy of DS/Cu was identified, to the best of our
knowledge, for the first time in PDX models generated
from tumor cells derived from an adult B-ALL patient.
In this pre-clinical setting, DS/Cu exhibited
remarkable cytotoxicity against both B-ALL cell lines
and primary adult B-ALL cells, while was only minimally
toxic towards normal PBMCs obtained from healthy
HSCT donors and cord blood, suggesting that the DS/Cu
regimen might be able to potently and selectively eliminate
adult B-ALL cells. The IC50 of DS in combination
with Cu (0.5 μM) for inhibiting proliferation of Nalm6
and REH cells was 0.18 μM and 0.24 μM, respectively,
which are lower than the DS IC50 of 0.5 μM in a mixture
with Cu in MM cell lines [19]. It is noteworthy that the
anti-proliferative IC50 of 0.5 μM for both DS and Cu is
significantly lower than the concentration achieved with
a normal adult dose for the treatment of alcoholism and

anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in human
glioblastoma cells, as well as ALDH-positive cancer
stem-like cells [10] and breast cancer stem cells [12]. The
results of the present study elucidate that DS/Cu induced
apoptosis of B-ALL cells most likely via activation of the
mitochondria-related intrinsic apoptotic pathway, reflected
by loss of mitochondria membrane potential, downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g.,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), and following caspase-3 activation and
PARP degradation. A similar mechanism for anti-leukemia
activity of DS/Cu might also operate in vivo in PDX
models of adult B-ALL, manifested by down-regulation
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL after co-administration of DS/Cu.
While the mechanisms underlying down-regulation of
these anti-apoptotic proteins by DS/Cu remains to be
defined, the results of the present study suggest that DS/Cu
might primarily act to activate the mitochondria-mediated
intrinsic apoptotic pathway, at least in part, via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g.,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL).
In summary, the present study demonstrated that
DS in combination with Cu effectively and selectively
eradicates adult B-ALL cells, including inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, impair of
clonogenicity, and suppression of tumor growth in PDX
models. Significantly, cytotoxicity of DS/Cu correlated to
certain clinical adverse prognostic factors including WBC
counts at diagnosis and p16 gene deletion. Moreover,
anti-leukemia activity of DS/Cu was mechanistically
associated with down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family members and activation of the mitochondriamediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Therefore, the
present findings suggest that the DS/Cu regimen warrants
further consideration in adult B-ALL, particularly certain
clinical/genetic subsets with poor prognosis.

Primary samples

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apoptosis was measured using Annexin V-APC/
PI (Ebioscience, San Diego, USA) dual staining by flow
cytometry. Briefly, cells (2×105/well) were seeded into 24well plates and exposed to DS at different doses (0.025,
0.05, 0.1, 0.2 µM) either with or without Cu (0.5 µM)
for 24 hrs. Cells were harvested, washed twice with iced
PBS, and double labeled with Annexin V-APC/PI for 30
minutes at 4°C in the dark. Cells were then analyzed by
flow cytometry using FACS C6 (BD, Oxford, UK).

Peripheral blood (PB) samples from healthy
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) donors
and bone marrow (BM) samples from newly diagnosed
adult B-ALL patients were obtained at Department
of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical
University. Informed consent was provided for research
purposes only, approved by the Nanfang Hospital Ethics
Review Board, in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Clinical characteristics of the B-ALL patients
are summarized in Table 1 and Supplemental Table S1.
Mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation using LymphoprepTM (BD, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA), washed twice with PBS, and cultured in IMDM
(HyClone, Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10%
FBS (Gibco, Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin and
100µg/ml streptomycin (1×P/S).

Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay
Cytotoxicity of DS/Cu was determined using
a CCK-8 kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Briefly,
cells (5×104 cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates
containing 100 μl of growth medium and then treated
with designated doses of DS in combination with 0.5 µM
Cu for 24 hrs. After treatment, CCK-8 reagents (10 µl/
well) were added and incubated for 2 hrs at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 incubator. Finally, absorbance at 450 nm were read
by a microplate reader (ELX800, Bio TEK, USA). All
experiments were repeated three times and performed in
triplicate in each experiment. The IC50 value of each cell
line was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.

Annexin V-APC/PI double staining assay by flow
cytometry

Chemicals and reagents
Disulfiram (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) and copper (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset,
UK) were dissolved in DMSO as 5 mM stock solution
and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as 100 mM stock
solution, respectively. Both stock solutions were stored at
-20°C and freshly diluted with culture medium before use.

Clonogenic assay

Cell lines and cell culture

Cells (2×105/well) were seeded in 24-well plates
and treated for 6 hrs with DS (0.05 µM) alone or in
combination with Cu (0.5 µM). Cells were collected and
further cultured in complete methylcellulose medium at
a cell density of 500/well in 6-well plates for 14 days.
Colonies consisting of at least 50 cells were counted and
analyzed for clonogenicity.

Nalm6 and REH cell lines were purchased from
ATCC (Teddington, UK). Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (HyClone, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco,
Life Technologies, NY, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and
100µg/ml streptomycin (1×P/S).

Analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential

euthanized, after which their spleens were photographed
and weighed, and leukemia load (human CD45+ cells) in
peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and spleen was
determined by flow cytometry after staining with antihuman-CD45 antibody. The viscera organs (including
BM, spleen, liver and kidney) were removed and fixed in
10% paraformaldehyde for 24 hrs, after which paraffinembedded sections were prepared and subjected to H&E
staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for human Bcl2 and Bcl-xL.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ∆Ψm)
was determined using a JC-1 kit (Beyotime Biotechnology,
China) as per the manufacturer’s instruction. After
exposed to various concentrations of DS in combination
with 0.5 µM Cu for 12 hrs, cells were collected, washed
twice with iced PBS, resuspended in 500 µl 1× working
JC-1 solution, and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in the
dark. After washing twice with a JC-1 buffer solution,
MMP were analyzed by FACS C6 (BD).

Statistical analysis

Western blot analysis

Values represent the mean ±SD for at least three
independent experiments. Comparisons between two
groups were analyzed using the 2-tailed Student’s t test.
Multiple-group comparisons were performed using the
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the
Bonferroni posthoc test. Two-way ANOVA analysis was
used to examine the relationship between various clinical
characteristics of B-ALL patients and cytotoxicity of DS/
Cu against primary B-ALL cells. Analyses utilized IBM
SPSS 19.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. P values <
0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Whole cell lysates (30 μg protein/lane) was
electrophoresed in 10% SDS- PAGE and transferred to
a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
After blocked for 1 hr for non-specific binding in TBS-T
with 5% non-fat milk, blots were incubated with primary
antibodies (Bcl-2, rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; PARP, rabbit
polyclonal, 1:500; Bcl-xL, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. Herts, UK; caspase-3, rabbit
monoclonal, 1:1000, Beyotime, China) overnight at 4°C,
followed by secondary HRP-conjugated monoclonal
antibody (1:10000, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h
at room temperature. Blots were re-probed with β-actin
antibody (rabbit-monoclonal, 1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology) to ensure equal protein loading. Blots
were visualized on X-ray films using an enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit
(Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK).
