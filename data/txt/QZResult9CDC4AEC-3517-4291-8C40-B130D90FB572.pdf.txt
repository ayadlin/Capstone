ABSTRACT
Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay of treatment of advanced prostate
cancer (PCa). However, a significant portion of patients experience disease relapse
and tumors ultimately evolve into castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), for
which there is no cure in the clinic. The Polycomb protein enhancer of zeste homolog
2 (EZH2) is frequently overexpressed in CRPC. It is unclear whether EZH2 can be a
therapeutic target in CRPC. Here, we demonstrated that chemo- and radiotherapy
agents such as camptothecin (CPT) and γ irradiation decrease EZH2 expression in
various PCa cell lines. We provided evidence that functional p53 and RB proteins are
required for CPT- and irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2 in CRPC cells. We
demonstrated that EZH2-specific small molecule inhibitors mitigate CRPC cell growth.
We further showed that the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 inhibits both Polycomb-dependent
and -independent functions of EZH2 in PCa cells. Importantly, we found that inhibition
of EZH2 by genetic and pharmacological means sensitizes CRPC cells to CPT-induced
apoptotic death and growth inhibition in culture and in mice. Our data suggest that
concomitant administration of small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 may significantly
increase the anti-tumor efficacy of conventional chemo- and radiotherapies in CRPC.

repressive complex-2 (PRC2). EZH2 functions as a
methyltranstranferase in the PRC2 complex that promotes
histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) [1]. This
histone modification promotes formation of repressive
chromatin and causes epigenetic silencing of a large
number of genes that drive cell differentiation and inhibit
cell proliferation, migration and invasion [2–5].
Earlier studies show that the promoter activity of the
EZH2 gene is regulated by the transcription factor E2F1
and that EZH2 mRNA expression is regulated by the
RB-E2F1 pathway [6]. Further studies demonstrate that
expression of EZH2 is also regulated by sex hormones
such as androgens and that this effect is mediated by

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly
diagnosed malignancy in men and the second leading
cause of male cancer death in the United States. Androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for
patients with advanced/metastatic PCa. Unfortunately,
this treatment is palliative, and 2–3 years after hormonal
therapy most patients develop castration-resistant PCa
(CRPC), from which patients eventually succumb.
The Polycomb group (PcG) protein EZH2

EED and forms a protein complex called Polycomb

p130, another pocket protein in the RB family and the
transcription factor E2F4 [7]. In addition to regulation by
transcription factors, EZH2 expression is also regulated by
microRNAs such as miR101 [3].
Expression and function of EZH2 are often deregulated
in PCa cells. The relevance of EZH2 in human prostate
cancers is first evident by the finding that expression of
EZH2 is highly upregulated in metastatic CRPC relative to
the benign prostatic tissues and primary PCa [2]. Since this
seminal discovery, interest in the crucial roles of EZH2 in
PCa and other types of cancer is increasing exponentially
[8–10]. EZH2 not only plays an essential role in anchorageindependent growth of PCa cells [9, 11], but is also required
for PCa cell growth and invasion in vitro and metastasis
in animals [3, 9, 11–14]. Moreover, it has been shown
that AKT phosphorylates EZH2 at serine 21 and that this
phosphorylation inhibits the Polycomb-dependent (PcD)
function of EZH2 by blocking the assembling a functional
PRC2 complex [15]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated
that serine 21 on EZH2 becomes hyperphosphorylated in
CPRC cells [16]. Hyperphosphorylation of EZH2 not only
inhibits its H3K27me3-dependent gene repression function,
but also renders EZH2 a Polycomb-independent (PcI) gene
activation function in CRPC cells [16]. Notably, this function
of EZH2 still depends on the methyltransferase activity
[16]. Thus, EZH2 is not only overexpressed, but also gains
new functions in CRPC cells, implying that it is a viable
therapeutic target of CRPC.
Because of the deregulation of EZH2 in human
PCa and many other cancer types, it becomes an ideal
target for drug development. A number of EZH2 small
molecule inhibitors have been developed and their
antitumor efficacy has been tested in a number of
tumor models such as lymphoma [17, 18]. However,
their inhibitory effects on the PcI function of EZH2
and CRPC cell growth have not been tested. In the
present study, we demonstrated that expression of EZH2
protein is downregulated by treatment of PCa cells
with the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin (CPT)
and irradiation. This effect was primarily dependent on
the activation of the p53 and RB pathways. We further
showed that treatment of EZH2 inhibitors induces
apoptosis of CRPC cells and this effect is largely
enhanced by co-treatment of cells with CPT.

To test this hypothesis, we treated three different PCa
cell lines LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145 with camptothecin
(CPT), a chemotherapeutic drug that inhibits the
religation activity of topoisomerase-1 and therefore
causes DNA double-strand breaks. We found that CPT
treatment invariably decreased EZH2 protein expression,
but to various extents in these cell lines (Figure 1A, 1B
and 1C). By 48 h after CPT treatment, none, little and
significant amount of EZH2 proteins were detected in
LNCaP (p53- and RB-positive), PC-3 (p53-negative
and RB-positive) and DU145 (p53- and RB-negative)
cells, respectively (Figure 1A, 1B and 1C). These data
suggest that the intactness of the p53 and RB pathways
is important for CPT-induced downregulation of EZH2
proteins in PCa cells. This concept is further supported
by the studies using γ irradiation. Although not robust as
CPT treatment, γ irradiation also decreased EZH2 protein
expression, at least at a very high dose, in LNCaP cells,
which express a wild-type p53 (Figure 1D). In contrast, γ
irradiation had little or no effect on EZH2 expression in
PC-3 and DU145 cells, both of which are p53-deficient
(Figure 1E and 1F).
It has been shown previously that castration
increases EZH2 expression in LNCaP xenograft
tumors in mice [7]. In agreement with this observation,
EZH2 levels were substantially upregulated in LNCaP
cells when cultured in androgen depleted medium
(Figure 1G). Importantly, CPT treatment completely
inhibited androgen deprivation-induced increase in
EZH2 expression (Figure 1G). Also, consistent with
the previous finding [7], EZH2 expression was much
higher in castration-resistant C4-2 cells compared to
androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells (Figure 1H). However,
CPT treatment completely inhibited EZH2 expression
in both cell lines (Figure 1H). Thus, our data show that
expression of EZH2 is regulated by the chemotherapeutic
agents such as CPT and irradiation and that the effects
of these treatments are substantially affected by the
intactness of p53 and/or RB pathways in PCa cells.
These data also suggest that CPT treatment can overcome
androgen deprivation-induced upregulation of EZH2 in
CRPC cells.

p53 is required for irradiation-induced
downregulation of EZH2 in PCa cells

RESULTS

To determine the importance of a functional p53
in irradiation-mediated inhibition of EZH2 expression in
PCa cells, endogenous p53 was knocked down by a pool
of gene-specific siRNAs in androgen-sensitive LNCaP
and castration-resistant C4-2 cells prior to irradiation
treatment. As demonstrated in Figure 2A and 2B,
endogenous p53 was effectively knocked down in both
cell lines (at the 0-h time point of γ irradiation treatment).
Importantly, depletion of p53 completely blocked
irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2 protein in

Inhibition of EZH2 expression by chemo- and
radiotherapy agents in PCa cells
Because expression of EZH2 is regulated by the
RB/p130-E2F axis [6, 7] and this pathway is directly
under the control of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs),
we hypothesized that EZH2 expression can be inhibited
due to the activation of the DNA damage-responsive
pathways, which often leads to inhibition of CDKs [21].

both cell lines (Figure 2A and 2B). Thus, these results
provide further support to the finding in p53-deficient
PC-3 and DU145 cell lines (Figure 1E and 1F) that p53 is
required for irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2
protein in PCa cells.

Treatment of C4-2 cells with other two EZH2
inhibitors GSK343 and GSK503 (Figure 4A) also decreased
cell growth (Figure 4B and 4C). We also examined the antitumor effect of these EZH2 inhibitors on murine PTEN-null
CRPC cell line PTEN-CaP8 [19]. Treatment with GSK343
and GSK503 also inhibited the growth of PTEN-CaP8
cells (Figure 4D and 4E). Intriguingly, the effect of these
compounds was more pronounced in PTEN-CaP8 than in
C4-2 cells (Figure 4B–4E). It has been showed previously
that phosphorylation of threonine 350 on EZH2 is important
for the functions of EZH2 in promoting H3K27me3 and
gene silencing [5, 24] We demonstrated that EZH2
threonine 350 phosphorylation was substantially higher
in C4-2 cells compared to PTEN-CaP8 cells (Figure 4F).
We did not detect any overt difference in expression of
total EZH2, total AKT and phosphorylated AKT (serine
473) between these two cell lines (Figure 4F). These data
suggest that hypersensitivity of PTEN-CaP8 cells to the
EZH2 inhibitors may be attributed to the lower activity of
EZH2 in this cell line. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that
different EZH2 inhibitors invariably inhibit the growth of
both human and mouse CRPC cell lines, suggesting that
EZH2 is a viable therapeutic target of CRPC.

RB is important for irradiation-induced
inhibition of EZH2 expression
Next, we examined the causal role of RB and other
pocket proteins p107 and p130 in irradiation-induced
suppression of EZH2 expression. To this end, endogenous
RB, p107 and p130 was knocked down individually by
a pool of gene-specific siRNAs in LNCaP cells, which
express functional RB, p107 and p130 proteins [7].
Consistent with the previous reports that RB and p130
act as negative regulators of EZH2 [6, 7], knockdown
of endogenous RB or p130 increased expression of
EZH2 protein (Figure 2C and 2D). A similar result
was obtained by knockdown of p107 (Figure 2E). As
expected, treatment of LNCaP cells with γ irradiation
decreased EZH2 protein levels, but this effect was
completely abrogated by knockdown of endogenous
RB (Figure 2C). In contrast, the effect of knockdown of
p130 on irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2
protein was very minimal compared to the effect of RB
(Figure 2C and 2D). Similarly, knockdown of endogenous
p107 failed to block irradiation-induced downregulation
of EZH2 protein in these cells (Figure 2E). These data
imply that the p53-CDK-RB signaling axis is important
for irradiation-induced inhibition of EZH2 expression in
PCa cells (Figure 2F).

GSK126 inhibits Polycomb-dependent and
-independent functions of EZH2 in PCa cells
In addition to canonical Polycomb-dependent (PcD)
gene repression function, EZH2 also gains a Polycombindependent (PcI) gene activation function in CRPC cells
[16]. Given that both PcD and PcI functions of EZH2 are
dependent on its methyltransferase activity [16], we sought
to determine whether the EZH2 inhibitor can inhibit both
PcD and PcI functions of EZH2 by affecting target gene
expression. Consistent with the finding that treatment of
C4-2 cells with GSK126 increased protein expression of
the EZH2-repressed genes DAB2IP and FOXJ1 (Figure
3C), GSK126 treatment also upregulated the expression of
two other well-studied EZH2-repressed genes HOXA9 and
BRACHYURY (or called T gene) [5, 23] (Figure 5A). In
agreement with the previous finding that EZH2 PcI target
genes are well expressed in human CRPC cell lines C4-2B
and CWR22Rv1 [16], we demonstrated that the PcI genes
TMEM48, CSK2 and KIAA0101 were readily expressed
in C4-2 CRPC cells (Figure 5B). Importantly, expression
of these EZH2-activated genes was downregulated by
GSK126, at least in a high dose (Figure 5B). Thus, both
PcD and PcI functions of EZH2 can be inhibited by the
EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 in human CRPC cells.

EZH2-specific small molecule inhibitors mitigate
CRPC cell growth
A series of EZH2-specific small molecule inhibitors
including GSK126, GSK343 and GSK503 have been
developed recently by GlaxoSmithKline and their effective
anti-cancer activity has been demonstrated in various
cancer models [17, 18, 22]. We have acquired these EZH2
inhibitors from GSK. Treatment of C4-2 CRPC cells with
GSK126 (Figure 3A) decreased cell viability in a dosedependent manner (Figure 3B). In agreement with this
observation, treatment of GSK126 increased expression of
BIM, a well-studied pro-apoptotic protein and caspase-3
activity (Figure 3C and 3D). The inhibition of the PcD
function of EZH2 by GSK126 was evident by increased
expression of known EZH2 targets DAB2IP and FOXJ1
[5, 23] and decreased levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 3C).
Moreover, GSK126 treatment also decreased the number
of C4-2, PTEN-CaP8 and PC-3 PCa cells invaded through
the matrix (Figure 3E and 3F), although these data cannot
rule out the possibility that the effect of GSK126 on cell
invasion can be attributed, at least in part, to GSK126induced cell death (Figure 3B and 3D).

DISCUSSION

CPT treatment enables to sensitize CRPC cells to
apoptotic death induced by the EZH2 inhibitor. To this
end, we treated C4-2 CRPC cells with CPT alone or in
combination with GSK126. As shown in Figure 6A,
treatment with CPT or GSK126 alone decreased C4-2
cell viability. Intriguingly, an additive inhibitory effect
was observed when cells were treated with both agents
(Figure 6A). In agreement with these observations,
co-treatment with CPT and GSK126 resulted in much
greater induction of EZH2-repressed target FOXJ1 and the
pro-apoptotic protein BIM in C4-2 cells (Figure 6B) as
well as higher caspase-3 activity (Figure 6C). Moreover,
FACS analysis indicated that the percentage of sub-G1
cells was much higher in CPT and GSK126 co-treated
cells than in cells treated with each individual agent
alone (Figure 6D). Furthermore, we demonstrated that
combination of CPT treatment and shRNA-mediated
knockdown of EZH2 resulted in much greater inhibition of
C4-2 tumor xenograft growth in mice (Figure 6E and 6F).
These data indicate that inhibition of EZH2 expression
by chemotherapy agents and EZH2 activity by the small
molecule inhibitors may have a greater therapeutic effect
on CRPC cells.

EZH2 is an oncogenic protein relevant to many,
if not all, aspects of PCa, including cell proliferation,
invasion and metastasis [2, 3]. Although significant
progress has been made toward understanding the
function and deregulation of EZH2 in PCa cells in vitro
and prostate tumors in vivo, it remains largely unclear
regarding how the novel regulatory mechanisms of EZH2
can be translated to effectively kill CRPC cells. In the
present study we demonstrated for the first time that EZH2
expression is downregulated by the chemotherapeutic
agent CPT and γ irradiation. Because expression of EZH2
is elevated following androgen deprivation in PCa cells in
culture, in mice and in human patients [2, 7], our findings
suggest that androgen deprivation-induced upregulation
of EZH2 and associated oncogenic impacts on PCa cell
function can be targeted by chemo- and radiotherapies.
This notion is supported by our observation that CPT
treatment abolishes androgen deprivation-induced increase
in EZH2 protein levels in LNCaP and C4-2 cell models.
Moreover, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined
with radiation therapy (RT) has become a mainstay of

such as TMEM48, CSK2 and KIAA0101. Thus, the antitumor effect of EZH2 inhibitors is likely attributed to their
inhibition of both PcD and PcI functions of EZH2.
The anti-tumor effect of the EZH2 inhibitor
GSK126 was detected in the lymphoma model at the
concentrations of nanomoles. However, the effective
concentrations of GSK126 in CPRC cells were much
higher than those used in lymphoma models. Our
finding that the level of EZH2 can be downregulated
by the chemotherapeutic agent CPT suggests that cotreatment of PCa with CPT may increase the sensitivity
of CRPC cells to the EZH2 inhibitor. Indeed, we
provide evidence that CPT largely enhances cell death
induced by GSK126 and co-administration of both drugs
results in much greater inhibitory effect on CRPC cell
growth. Together, our findings suggest that combined
administration of small molecule inhibitors of EZH2
with the conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy
represents a new strategy for effective treatment of
CRPC in patients.

treatment for intermediate-to-high risk, locally advanced
PCa [25–27]. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) [28, 29], European Organization for Research
and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) [30] and others
[31] have conducted randomized prospective trials and
demonstrated an overall survival benefit in intermediateand high-risk localized PCa when external beam radiation
therapy (EBRT) is combined with ADT versus EBRT or
ADT alone [32–34]. Thus, it is warranted to investigate
whether irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2
contributes to the therapeutic effect of ADT and RT in
clinic. Furthermore, expression of EZH2 mRNA and
protein are upregulated due to deletion of the PTEN tumor
suppressor in PCa cells in culture and in mice [35–37].
Given that loss of PTEN occurs in approximately 20%
of localized and over 60% of advanced/metastatic PCa in
patients, it is also of paramount importance to explore in
the future whether PTEN loss could serve as a molecular
determinant for irradiation-induced downregulation of
EZH2 protein and the associated therapeutic benefits in
PCa patients.
An important aspect of our findings is that
irradiation-induced downregulation of EZH2 is abolished
by depletion of p53. The same is true in RB-deficient
PCa cells. It is well documented that the TP53 gene is
frequently mutated in metastatic or CRPC samples
[38, 39]. Also, a significant portion of human prostate
cancers have loss of RB [38]. Therefore, it can be
postulated that frequent loss of p53 and RB in PCa may
cause the resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy-induced
downregulation of EZH2 and thereby compromise the
therapeutic effect of these regimens in a large segment of
patients.
EZH2-specific inhibitors have been developed
recently and their anti-cancer activity has been manifested
in various cancer models including lymphomas [17, 40].
Because EZH2 is frequently overexpressed in human
metastatic CRPC in patients [2], it is both relevant and
significant to determine the therapeutic effect of EZH2
inhibitors on CRPC cells. Using both human and murine
CRPC cell lines as working models, we demonstrated that
treatment with different EZH2 inhibitors invariably induce
a decrease in cell growth and viability. We further showed
that this effect is attributed to apoptotic cell death. At
present, it is unclear which downstream pathways mediate
EZH2 inhibitor-induced apoptotic death of CRPC cells
and further investigation is warranted. It is worth noting
that in addition to the well-studied PcD gene repression
function of EZH2, a PcI gene activation function of EZH2
has been uncovered recently [16]. In agreement with the
findings that both PcD and PcI functions of EZH2 require
the methyltransferase activity [16], we demonstrated
that treatment of the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 not only
causes de-repression of EZH2-repressed genes such as
BRACHYURY, HOXA9, DAB2IP and FOXJ1, but also
downregulates the expression of EZH2-activated genes

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, cell culture and reagents
LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145 PCa cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) in 2010. C4-2 CRPC cell line was
purchased from Uro Corporation (Oklahoma City, OK) in
2006. PTEN-CaP8 murine PTEN-deficient CRPC cell line
was kindly provided by Dr. Hong Wu at UCLA [19]. Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (Life Technologies) and 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). All cell
lines were cultured at 5% CO2, 37°C and 95% humidity.
Authentication of these cell lines was performed in
our laboratory within 6 months of this submission by
examining the expression of epithelial cell markers,
androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
PTEN, total AKT and AKT phosphorylation at serine
residues 473 and 308 using western blots. Camptothecin
(CPT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The EZH2
small molecule inhibitors GSK126, GSK343 and GSK503
[17, 18] were kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK). Non-specific control and EZH2-specific small
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were purchased from SigmaAldrich.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer [1 × PBS,
1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)]. The concentration
of samples was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Equal amounts of samples were separated

nitrocellulose membranes. Subsequently, membranes
were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C.
Next day, the membranes were washed with 1 × TBST
and incubated in room temperature with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 h. Proteins were detected by
chemiluminescence. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
were purchased from GE Healthcare. The following
antibodies were used: EZH2, RB, histone H3, AKT and
phosphor-AKT (serine 473) (Cell Signaling Technology);
p53, p130 and p107 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); FOXJ1
and BIM (Millipore); DAB2IP and H3K27me3 (Abcam).
EZH2 threonine 350 phosphorylation-specific antibodies
were generated as we reported previously [5].

C4-2 and PTEN-CaP8 cells (5 × 103) were plated
into 96-well plates and cultured in medium containing
10% FBS. At 24 h after plating, cells were treated with
EZH2 inhibitors and MTS solution (Promega) was added
into each well. At different time points (from 0 to 96 h
after drug treatment), plates were incubated for 2 h at
37°C. Absorbance at a wavelength of 490 nm (A490) was
measured with a Versamax Microplate Reader. Growth
curve was calculated according to the values of A490 of
six replicates at each time point.

Analysis of apoptotic cells using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS)

RNA extraction and real-time PCR

Apoptotic cell death (sub-G1) was analyzed using
FACS as we described previously [20]. C4-2 cells were
treated with vehicle (DMSO), CPT, GSK126 or both. At
48 h after treatment, cells were collected and washed with
1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After fixation with
70% ethanol, cells were washed twice with 1 × PBS and
stained with a solution containing 20 μg/ml propidium
iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A. Cells were incubated for 30
min at the room temperature and cell cycle profiles were
determined by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BectonDickinson).

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells
using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). cDNA was
synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life
Technologies). Real-time PCR was performed using IQ
SYRB Green Supermix and an iCycler iQTX detection
system (Bio-Rad). All the signals were normalized by
GAPDH and the 2-∆∆Ct method was used to determine the
fold changes. Primers used were as follows: BRACHYURY,
forward 5′-AGGTGGGGAAGTTTCCTTCT-3′ and
reverse 5′-GCAAATGAGGTCCTTTTGGT-3′; HOXA9,
forward 5′-TTGGAGGAAATGAATGCTGA-3′ and
reverse 5′-TGGTCAGTAGGCCTTGAGGT-3′; TMEM48,
forward 5′-AGGTCGCGGGACATACTGT-3′ and reverse
5′-TGCAGATGGGTAGAAATAGCACT-3′;
CSK2,
forward 5′-TTCGACGAACACTACGAGTACC-3′ and
reverse 5′-GGACACCAAGTCTCCTCCAC-3′; KIAA0101,
forward 5′-ATGGTGCGGACTAAAGCAGAC-3′ and
reverse
5′-CCTCGATGAAACTGATGTCGAAT-3′;
GAPDH, forward 5′-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGAC-3′
and reverse 5′-TGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTT-3′.

Caspase-3 activity measurement
The activity of caspase-3 was measured
by Caspase-3 Colorimetric Protease Assay (Life
Technologies). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 50 μl
lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cellular
proteins (100 μg) were diluted in 50 μl lysis buffer and
50 μl reaction buffer (containing 10 mmol/L DTT). Five
microliters of the 4 mmol/l DEVD-pNA substrate (200
μmol/l final concentration) were added, and the reaction
was carried out at 37°C for 2 h in the dark. Reactions were
measured in a microplate reader at 405 nm (A405).

Small interference RNA (siRNA)
Pools of non-specific control siRNAs (siC) or
gene-specific siRNAs for p53, RB, p107 and p130 were
purchased from GE Health Dharmacon. Transfections
were performed by electroporation using an Electro Square
Porator ECM 830 (BTX) or by using Lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies). Approximately 75–90% transfection
efficiencies were routinely achieved.

Generation and treatment of PCa xenografts
in mice
Six-week-old NOD-SCID IL-2-receptor gamma null
(NSG) mice were generated in house and used for animal
experiments. The animal study was approved by the
Mayo Clinic IACUC. All mice were housed in standard
conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle and access to food
and water ad libitum. C4-2 cells (3 × 106) infected with
lentivirus expressing control shRNA (control) or EZH2
shRNA were injected s.c. into the right flank of mice.
When xenografts were well established (7 days after
injection), mice were treated i.p. with CPT-11 (10 mg/kg/
day). The tumor size was measured every other day for 21
days and calculated using the formula LxW2x0.5.

Cell invasion assay
In vitro cell invasion assay was performed using
BioCoat Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. C4-2, PTEN-CaP8
and PC-3 cells were cultured in the insert for 24 h. Cells were
fixed in methanol for 15 min and then stained with 1 mg/ml
crystal violet for 20 min. At least 5 fields for each group were
photographed after staining and invaded cells were counted.
