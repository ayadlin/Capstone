ABSTRACT
We recently showed that the addition of fractionated doses of gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (GO) to standard chemotherapy improves clinical outcome of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In the present study, we performed mutational
analysis of 11 genes (FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, MLL, WT1, IDH1/2, RUNX1, ASXL1, TET2,
DNMT3A), EVI1 overexpression screening, and 6.0 single-nucleotide polymorphism
array (SNP-A) analysis in diagnostic samples of the 278 AML patients enrolled in the
ALFA-0701 trial. In cytogenetically normal (CN) AML (n = 146), 38% of the patients
had at least 1 SNP-A lesion and 89% of the patients had at least 1 molecular alteration.
In multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of higher cumulative incidence
of relapse were unfavorable karyotype (P = 0.013) and randomization in the control
arm (P = 0.007) in the whole cohort, and MLL partial tandem duplications (P = 0.014)
and DNMT3A mutations (P = 0.010) in CN-AML. The independent predictors of shorter
overall survival (OS) were unfavorable karyotype (P < 0.001) and SNP-A lesion(s)
(P = 0.001) in the whole cohort, and SNP-A lesion(s) (P = 0.006), DNMT3A mutations
(P = 0.042) and randomization in the control arm (P = 0.043) in CN-AML. Interestingly,
CN-AML patients benefited preferentially more from GO treatment as compared to AML
patients with abnormal cytogenetics (hazard ratio for death, 0.52 versus 1.14; test for
interaction, P = 0.04). Although the interaction test was not statistically significant,
the OS benefit associated with GO treatment appeared also more pronounced in FLT3
internal tandem duplication positive than in negative patients.

INTRODUCTION

some studies reported that novel lesions detected by
SNP-A-based karyotyping may complement CC and
improve AML outcome prediction [18–20].
In the present study, we thus performed SNP-Abased karyotyping and extensive mutational analysis in the
278 AML patients enrolled on the ALFA-0701 trial. Our
objectives were first to evaluate the prognostic impact of
these genetic alterations on clinical outcome, particularly
within the subset of CN-AML, and second to analyze
potential interactions between these genetic alterations
and GO treatment.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous
group of hematological malignancies with variable
responses to therapy. Age and karyotype have been
recognized as the most prominent prognostic factors
in AML patients. Over the last decade, it has been
reported that mutations of some genes of interest may
have prognostic significance, especially in patients with
cytogenetically normal (CN) AML. Prognostic impact
within CN-AML has been well established for FLT3
internal tandem duplication (FLT3–ITD), NPM1 and
CEBPA mutations. Mutations of these three genes allowed
a refined prognostic classification of CN-AML and
improved risk stratification in this subset of AML patients
[1, 2]. With recent progress in genomic technologies, a
large number of recurrent somatic mutations have been
discovered in AML, including mutations in ASXL1 [3],
TET2 [4], IDH1/2 [5], DNMT3A [6, 7], PFH6 [8],
and BCOR [9], thus providing new insights into the
mechanisms of leukemogenesis and further evidence of
the genetic complexity of AML. Retrospective studies
have suggested that these novel mutations may have
prognostic significance in AML, but these findings need
to be confirmed and validated prospectively in clinical trial
cohorts [10–12].
For years, standard induction chemotherapy in
AML patients has relied on the combination of cytarabine
and anthracycline, the so-called 7 
+ 
3 regimen. We
recently published the results of the ALFA-0701 Phase
3 trial, showing that the addition of fractionated doses
of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) during induction and
consolidation may significantly improve outcome of
AML patients aged 50–70 years [13]. GO is a humanized
immunoconjugate targeting the CD33 antigen, a myeloid
antigen expressed on the majority of AML leukemic cells.
Similar positive results have been reported in two Medical
Research Council (MRC) trials [14, 15], and, as in the
ALFA trial, it appeared that patients with favorable or
intermediate cytogenetics, including those with CN-AML,
may benefit from GO, while not those with adverse
karyotype. In this context, there is a growing interest in
identifying molecular determinants of response to this
targeted agent.
Refining conventional cytogenetics (CC) represents
another promising approach to improve prognostic
classification of AML, as CC detects an abnormal
karyotype in only half of AML patients. Single-nucleotide
polymorphism array (SNP-A)–based karyotyping has
revealed previously unrecognized acquired copy number
abnormalities (CNA) in AML genome [16, 17]. In addition
to a high level of resolution, SNP-A allows the detection
of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH), also
referred to as uniparental disomy (UPD) [17]. Moreover,

RESULTS
Patient characteristics at diagnosis
Baseline patient and AML characteristics are
provided in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary
Data, for all patients and CN-AML patients, respectively.
Median age was 62 years in the whole cohort and in
CN-AML. CC results were available for 254 patients, of
which 146 had a CN-AML. SNP-A data were available
for 248 patients. Among these 248 patients, 228 were also
analyzed by CC, of which 132 had a CN-AML.

Conventional cytogenetics and SNP-A
karyotyping
Among the 248 patients with available SNP-A data,
we found 450 genomic aberrations in 135 patients. CNA
(245 losses and 117 gains) concerned all chromosomes and
UPD (n  =  88) were located over all chromosomes except
chromosomes 7, 14 and 18. Details of SNP-A lesions are
provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Data. Types
and genomic distribution of SNP-A abnormalities were
highly distinct between normal and abnormal karyotypes
as defined by CC. Indeed, in AML with abnormal
karyotype (n  =  96), SNP-A lesions were more often CNA
(222 losses and 102 gains) than UPD (n  =  32). The median
size was 33 Mb (range, 0.16–243) for deletions, 87 Mb
(range, 0.4–249) for gains, and 24 Mb (range, 3–141) for
UPDs. Most deletions were identified at chromosomes 5
(n  =  28) and 7 (n  =  27), gains at chromosome 8 (n  =  23)
and UPD at the short arm of chromosome 17 (n = 5).
Nineteen patients with abnormal conventional karyotype
had no detectable SNP-A lesions, including 5 with
balanced chromosomal translocations or inversions, 13
with subclonal chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with
complex karyotype and several chromosome markers
that may result from complex balanced translocations.
In CN-AML, a total of 72 genomic aberrations were
detected by SNP-A analysis in 50/132 (38%) of the
patients, with a mean of 1.44 lesions per patient (range,
1–5). We detected 13 deletions (median size, 2 Mb;

range, 0.15–64), 11 gains (median size, 0.5 Mb; range,
0.12–191), and 48 regions of UPDs (median size,
38  Mb; range, 2–136). Most UPDs were identified at
chromosomes 13 and 1p in 7 and 6 patients, respectively
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Data).
Overall, in the 228 patients analyzed by both
techniques, the combination of CC and SNP-A karyotyping
leads to a higher proportion of abnormal karyotypes (64%)
compared with CC alone (42%) or SNP-A alone (56%)
(Figure S1 in the Supplementary Data).

Co-occurrence of genetic alterations in CN-AML

Response to induction therapy

Integrated SNP-A karyotyping and molecular
analysis in CN-AML allowed us to identify positive
and negative associations between those different
genetic alterations. We found that FLT3–ITD and
DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with
NPM1 mutations (P 
< 
0.001 for both comparisons).

Overall, complete remission (CR) or CRp
were achieved in 217 patients (202 CR and 15 CRp),
including 104 patients in the control arm and 113
patients in the GO arm. In the whole cohort, the presence
of unfavorable karyotype (P < 0.001), SNP-A lesion(s)
(P = 0.014) were associated with a lower CR/CRp rate,

The incidence of gene mutations and EVI1
overexpression in the whole cohort and in the subset of
CN-AML are respectively indicated in Table 2, and
Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Data. At least
one molecular abnormality was identified in 89% of the
patients with CN-AML and 60% showed mutations in more
than one of the studied genes (not shown). The description
of all gene mutations identified by Sanger sequencing is
provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Data.

Overall, NPM1 mutations co-occurred with at least 1
other mutation in 90% of cases. Frequent associations
between FLT3–ITD and DNMT3A mutations (P = 0.001),
RUNX1 and ASXL1 mutations (P = 0.033), RUNX1 and
MLL partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD) (P = 0.049)
were also observed. In contrast, RUNX1 (P = 0.009) and
CEBPA (P 
= 
0.033) mutations rarely co-existed with
NPM1 mutations. NPM1 and ASXL1 mutations were
mutually exclusive (P  =  0.003) (Figure 1A and 1B). EVI1
overexpression was not found concomitantly with any
gene mutation (P < 0.001) (Figure 1B).
When correlating mutational profile with SNP-A
data, we found a higher incidence of RUNX1 mutations
(P = 0.01) and a lower incidence of IDH2R140 mutations
(P = 0.03) in patients with SNP-A lesions compared
to patients without SNP-A lesions (Table S5 in the
Supplementary Data). We also observed that mutations
affecting CEBPA, RUNX1, DNMT3A, TET2 or WT1 were
found in 8/14 patients with UPDs (n = 12) or mono-allelic
losses (n = 2) encompassing the corresponding gene locus.
In addition, all 7 patients with UPD(13q) harbored a
FLT3–ITD (Figure 1).

karyotype and SNP-A lesions were predictive of a higher
cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (P < 0.001 and
P = 0.017, respectively). None of the molecular markers
studied significantly influenced CIR. In the subset of
CN-AML, MLL-PTD (P = 0.028) and DNMT3A mutations
(P = 0.004) were both associated with an increased risk of
relapse (Table 1).
Karyotype had a strong influence on overall survival
(OS), as expected (Table 2). Interestingly, we found
that OS was also significantly reduced in patients with
SNP-A lesion(s), either in the whole cohort (Figure 2A)
or in the subset of CN-AML (Figure 2B). In the whole
cohort, NPM1 mutations were associated with a longer OS
(P = 0.022), whereas EVI1 overexpression was associated
with a shorter OS (P = 0.010). In the CN-AML subset,
DNMT3A mutated patients had markedly reduced OS
compared to DNMT3A wild-type patients (Figure 3C).
Other molecular abnormalities studied did not significantly
affect OS of CN-AML patients (Table 2).

in contrast to FLT3–ITD and NPM1 mutations, which
conferred a higher CR/CRp rate (P = 0.035 and P = 0.022,
respectively). However, neither SNP-A lesion(s) nor
gene mutations had an impact on response to induction
therapy in the subset of CN-AML patients (Table S6 in
the Supplementary Data). In multivariate analysis of the
whole cohort, unfavorable karyotype remained the only
factor significantly associated with a lower probability
of achieving CR/CRp (P < 0.001). Randomization in the
GO arm was associated with a trend (P = 0.053) towards
a higher probability of CR/CRp achievement (Table S7
in the Supplementary Data).

Figure 2: (C) in CN-AML patients tested for DNMT3A mutation, 2–year OS was estimated at 68% (95%CI, 55–78) in those without
mutation versus 41% (95%CI, 24–57) in those with mutation (P = 0.0045 by the log-rank test).

We then performed a multivariate analysis on CIR
and OS considering the covariates previously selected
as associated with clinical outcome at the 10% level,
together with the treatment arm. The complete list of
covariates that entered the multivariate models for CIR
and OS is provided in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
The presence of unfavorable karyotype (P = 0.013) and
randomization in the control arm (P = 0.007) were retained
as significantly associated with higher CIR in the whole
cohort, while, only the presence of MLL-PTD (P = 0.014)
and DNMT3A mutations (P 
= 
0.010) independently
predicted higher CIR in CN-AML patients (Table 3). The
presence of unfavorable karyotype (P<0.001) and SNP-A
lesion(s) (P 
= 
0.001) independently predicted shorter
OS in the whole cohort, while the presence of SNP-A
lesion(s) (P = 0.006), DNMT3A mutations (P = 0.042) and
randomization in the control arm (P = 0.043) independently
predicted shorter OS in CN-AML patients (Table 4).

mutations in the whole cohort and in the CN-AML subset,
additionally with DNMT3A mutations in the CN-AML
subset. When testing these potential interactions by the
Gail and Simon statistics, no evidence of any statistically
significant interaction was found regarding CR/CRp
achievement (data not shown), CIR (Figure 3), and the
variables SNP-A lesions, DNMT3A mutations, and NPM1
mutations, irrespective of the endpoint.
Interestingly, we observed that the survival benefit
associated with GO addition was not apparent in patients
with unfavorable cytogenetics, conversely to those with
favorable/intermediate cytogenetics (HR, 1.44 versus 0.62;
test for interaction, P =  0.04; Figure 3). More specifically,
CN-AML patients benefited preferentially more from GO
treatment as compared to AML patients with abnormal
CC (HR, 0.52 versus 1.14; test for interaction, P  = 0.04;
Figure 3).
Moreover, the OS benefit associated with GO
treatment appeared more pronounced in FLT3–ITD
positive than in negative patients, in the whole cohort
as well as in CN-AML (Figure 4), although the Gail and
Simon test did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3).

In the ALFA-0701 trial, the NPM1 mutated/FLT3–ITD
negative genotype showed no significant influence on
outcome in CN-AML (data not shown). However, when
comparing the outcome of CN-AML patients with NPM1
mutated/FLT3–ITD negative genotype to those with other

genotypes, and according to the randomization arm, we
observed that the NPM1 mutated/FLT3–ITD negative
genotype was associated with favorable outcome in the
control arm (P = 0.04), but not in the GO arm (P = 0.89)
(Figure S4).

DISCUSSION

GO can be at least partially explained by the fact that
FLT3–ITD mutations confer a higher sensitivity to GO
(see below), which is likely to compensate the benefit
of being FLT3–ITD negative. Besides, the prognostic
analysis for less common molecular alterations like
CEBPA or IDH1/2 mutations was limited by the small
number of mutated cases in our cohort.
We and others [13–15] previously reported that
the benefit of GO addition was limited to patients with
cytogenetically favorable or intermediate-risk AML.
Presence of FLT3–ITD has been recognized as a
major predictor of outcome in AML, especially in the
CN-AML subset [11]. Nevertheless, in the ALFA-0701
trial, FLT3–ITD did not significantly impact on CIR and
OS in univariate analysis, suggesting that treatment with
GO may improve outcome of FLT3–ITD positive patients.
Actually, we found that the OS benefit associated with GO
treatment was more pronounced in FLT3–ITD positive
than in negative patients. Interestingly, these findings are
consistent with results from Jawad et al. who found that
leukemic stem and progenitor cells carrying FLT3–ITD
were more sensitive to GO and that FLT3–ITD status was
an independent predictor of in vitro chemosensitivity to
GO [27]. However, the mechanisms underlying these
differential responses remain unknown. Because GO has
been withdrawn from the market, very few data on the
genetic basis of response to GO in patients are available.
In the MRC AML16 trial, FLT3–ITD mutations were
found independently prognostic in older AML patients, but
not predictive of response to GO. However, the cumulative
dose of GO in this study was much lower than in the
ALFA-0701 trial, which may account for these discordant
results [15].
Overall, the current information about GO
supports the efficacy of this agent in newly diagnosed
AML, with acceptable toxicity [28, 29]. In light of three
published randomized trials [13–15], the most appropriate
indications for reapproval of GO in AML would be
patients with cytogenetically favorable or intermediaterisk AML [13–15, 28, 29]. Moreover, the present data
suggest that the addition of GO to standard chemotherapy
may be a promising treatment option especially for
FLT3–ITD positive AML. Although patients with FLT3–
ITD positive AML are usually considered as candidates
for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), the
benefit of this high-risk procedure in first CR for those
patients is still a matter of debate [30–32]. During the last
decade, FLT3 tyrosine kinase has emerged as an attractive
therapeutic target in FLT3 mutated AML. Several antiFLT3 compounds are undergoing evaluation in different
phases of clinical trials, as monotherapy or in combination
with standard chemotherapy. Despite promising in vitro
studies, clinical responses to single-agent FLT3 inhibitors
in AML patients are generally incomplete and not
sustained, and no significant improvement in OS has been

Our study is the first to prospectively analyze
SNP-A lesions along with a large panel of gene mutations
in a homogeneous cohort of adult patients with primary
AML. This combined analysis allowed us to evaluate the
relationships between these genetic alterations and their
prognostic significance in the context of treatment with GO.
Furthermore, we studied the interactions between treatment
with GO and the most frequent genetic markers in AML.
Several studies in AML [18–20] have shown
that SNP-A analysis allows a higher detection rate of
chromosomal defects than CC, mostly due to its ability
to detect small CNA and UPDs. In our cohort, we showed
that, whilst having a normal conventional karyotype, 38%
of the patients had ≥ 1 SNP-A lesion, UPDs being the most
common abnormalities. The spectrum of gene mutations
we observed is in agreement with previous studies and
underlines the particularly high incidence of NPM1 (52%),
DNMT3A (34%), and FLT3–ITD (25%) mutations in
older patients with CN-AML. Our study also confirms the
previously reported patterns of cooperativity between gene
mutations in CN-AML [11, 12, 21].
As previously described, the prognostic impact
of age and white blood cell count, two well-established
risk factors in AML, was not statistically significant
in our cohort [13]. The only independent predictors of
OS we identified in the whole cohort were unfavorable
cytogenetics and SNP-A lesions. Unfavorable cytogenetics
was also the only independent prognostic factor for
relapse risk in the whole cohort. The potential of
genetic profiling to refine prognosis in CN-AML has
been highlighted by many studies [10–12, 19, 20]. In
our study, multivariate analysis in CN-AML showed
that presence of SNP-A lesions, MLL-PTD, DNMT3A
mutations, and randomization in the control arm were
associated with poor clinical outcome. Thus, our study
confirmed the markedly poor prognostic impact of SNP-A
lesions, both in the whole cohort and in the CN-AML
subset, in accordance with previous reports [18–20]. The
adverse prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in CNAML has been consistently reported by several groups,
including our own [22]. However, the molecular subgroup
in which DNMT3A mutations are found significantly
associated to a worse outcome varies across studies,
most reports showing that the poor prognostic impact of
DNMT3A mutations was most obvious in CN-AML with
NPM1/FLT3 non-favorable genotypes [11, 23–26]. These
subgroup analyses were not relevant in the ALFA-0701
trial since the prognostic impact of NPM1 mutated/FLT3–
ITD negative genotype was not significant in the whole
CN-AML cohort, but only in CN-AML patients treated
in the control arm. In our study, the lack of favorable
prognostic value of the NPM1 mutated/FLT3–ITD
negative genotype in CN-AML patients treated with

demonstrated so far [33, 34]. Therefore, in FLT3–ITD
positive AML patients, particularly in those not eligible
for allo-SCT, the addition of GO to standard chemotherapy
appears as an interesting treatment option, that would be
worthy of further investigation in clinical trials.
In conclusion, our study emphasizes that SNP-A
lesions and DNMT3A mutations represent adverse
prognostic factors, particularly in CN-AML. Both markers
add independent prognostic information and, therefore,
could contribute to improve risk stratification in patients
with CN-AML. Importantly, our results suggest that
addition of GO to standard chemotherapy might overcome
the poor prognosis of FLT3–ITD. However, further studies
based on larger patient cohorts are required to formally
identify the molecular determinants of response to GO.

from the same specimen and reverse transcribed using the
High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems,

available in the Supplementary Data.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients and treatment
From January 2008 to November 2010, 278 patients
aged 50–70 years with previously untreated primary AML
were included in the randomized multicentric Phase 3
ALFA-0701 trial (NCT00927498), investigating the
benefit of the addition of low fractionated doses of GO to
standard front-line chemotherapy (Supplementary Data)
[13]. The study was approved by the ethics committee of
Saint-Germain en Laye, France, and by the institutional
review board (IRB) of the French Regulatory Agency
and undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.
Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples collected at
AML diagnosis and after treatment were obtained from
the tissue bank “Tumorothèque du Centre de Référence
Régional en Cancérologie de Lille (C.R.R.C.)” and an
approval of this study was obtained from the IRB of
CHRU of Lille (CSTMT089).

SNP-A analysis
Patient genomic DNA was processed and hybridized
to Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer
instructions. Raw data were analyzed using the Genotyping
Console version 4.1 software (Affymetrix). In order to
distinguish somatic from constitutional SNP array lesions,
we adopted a stringent and conservative algorithm.
Aberrations were excluded as known copy number variants
if there was > 50% overlap with variants from the public
Database of Genomic Variants (DGV Beta version 10).
Interstitial UPD < 20 Mb were considered as constitutional
and excluded from the analysis. Subsequently, all CNA and
UPD were validated by visual inspection and annotated
based on the hg19 human genome assembly.

Conventional cytogenetic analysis
Cytogenetic R-banding analysis was performed
on diagnostic bone marrow samples using standard
methods. The karyotypes were described according
to the International System for Human Cytogenetic
Nomenclature recommendations [35] and classified
according to the revised MRC criteria within 3 groups
(favorable, intermediate and unfavorable) [36].

Statistical analysis
Median with interquartile range and percentages
were computed as summary statistics. Clinical endpoints
considered for prognostic analyses were CR/CRp rate,
CIR and OS. CIR and OS were calculated after censoring
patients who received allo-SCT in first CR at allo-SCT
time. We focused here on the prognostic influence of CC,
SNP-A, and molecular alterations. First, univariate analyses
for CR/CRp were based on logistic regression models with
prognostic influence measured by odds ratio (OR) with 95%

method, compared by the log-rank test [46, 47]. Stepwise
multivariable Cox models allowed assessing the additional
prognostic influence of those variables previously selected
at the 10% level [48]. Secondly, prognostic analyses were
limited to the subset of patients with CN-AML. Finally, to
identify optimal treatment groups, interactions were tested
using the Gail and Simon statistics [49]. This consisted of
testing the heterogeneity in the OR of CR/CRp or in the
HR of relapse or death according to cytogenetics, SNP-A
karyotyping, and molecular findings in the two randomized
treatment arms. Statistical analysis was performed with
SAS (version 9.2, SAS Inc., Cary, NC) and R (version
2.13.1) softwares. All reported P-values are two-sided, with
a nominal type I error of 0.05.
