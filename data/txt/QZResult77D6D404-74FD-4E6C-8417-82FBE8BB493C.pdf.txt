Optimal Targeting of HER2–PI3K Signaling in Breast Cancer:
Mechanistic Insights and Clinical Implications
Brent N. Rexer and Carlos L. Arteaga

Abstract
The combination of a PI3K inhibitor with trastuzumab has been shown to be effective at overcoming
trastuzumab resistance in models of HER2þ breast cancer by inhibiting HER2–PI3K–FOXO–survivin signaling.
In this review the potential clinical implications of these ﬁndings are discussed. Cancer Res; 73(13); 3817–20.

Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor
encoded by the HER2 protooncogene, is the mainstay of treatment for patients with HER2 gene–ampliﬁed breast cancer. The
main mechanisms of action of the antibody are antibodydependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) with reconstitution of adoptive immunity to HER2 (1, 2), downregulation of
HER2 from the cell surface (3), and disruption of ligand-independent HER2–HER3 dimers, thus partially inhibiting postreceptor phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (4). Despite
its effectiveness in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings,
therapeutic resistance to trastuzumab remains an important
clinical problem. A number of preclinical studies have proposed
several molecular mechanisms whereby tumors can evade the
action of trastuzumab. These mechanisms include engagement
of alternate signaling pathways, alterations in antibody binding
to HER2, loss of the apoptotic response, or evasion of the
immunomodulatory effects conferred by trastuzumab; in several cases, analysis of cohorts of patients treated with trastuzumab has suggested that at least some of these mechanisms
are operative in vivo (5). Signaling to PI3K–Akt as a result of
HER2–HER3 dimerization is the most important survival pathway downstream of HER2 (4, 6). Several lines of evidence suggest
that inhibition of PI3K–Akt is critical for the antitumor effect of
HER2-directed therapies. Indeed, several of the proposed
mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab involve persistence
or reactivation of PI3K signaling via alternative ampliﬁed
receptor tyrosine kinases and/or mutations in PI3K pathway
components, thus suggesting that direct and more sustained
inhibition of PI3K might be a strategy to overcome or prevent
resistance to trastuzumab or other HER2 inhibitors.
There are a number of therapeutic inhibitors of PI3K–AKT
currently in clinical development. Results from several pre-

clinical studies suggest that trastuzumab resistance is overcome by PI3K pathway inhibitors (4, 7, 8). Inhibition of nodes in
the PI3K pathway downstream of AKT may also prove to be an
effective and potentially less toxic strategy. For example,
emerging clinical evidence suggests that blockade of mTOR
downstream of HER2 with the TORC1 inhibitor everolimus, in
combination with trastuzumab and a taxane, can induce
signiﬁcant clinical responses in patients with metastatic
HER2þ breast cancer who had previously progressed on trastuzumab therapy (9, 10). Thus, the recent study by Chakrabarty
and colleagues (11) is timely and of interest because it provides
further insights into why maximal inhibition of PI3K is
required for optimal inhibition of HER2þ breast cancer cells.
This work also raises some important considerations for the
future clinical development of PI3K inhibitors in this subtype of
breast cancer that will be discussed herein.
In this study, the authors used the ATP-competitive, panPI3K (p110) inhibitor, XL147, to inhibit PI3K in several HER2
gene–ampliﬁed trastuzumab-resistant cell lines. These included the Herceptin-resistant HR5 and HR6 cells that escape
trastuzumab action by upregulation of EGFR and HER3 ligands
(12), and two cell lines with somatic genetic alterations in the
PI3K pathway: HCC1569 cells, with deletion of PTEN, and the
HCC1954 and SUM190 cells, both with "hotspot" activating
mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110a catalytic
subunit of PI3K. PTEN is the lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3, the product of PI3K activity. Both "hotspot"
mutations in PIK3CA confer p110a with increased catalytic
activity over that of the wild-type enzyme (13, 14). Thus, loss of
PTEN and PIK3CA mutations ampliﬁes PI3K signaling beyond
a level conferred by HER2 overexpression alone and, as a result,
counteracts the action of trastuzumab and other HER2 inhibitors. In several retrospective studies, aberrant activation
of PI3K as deﬁned by either of these alterations, that is, PTEN
loss or PIK3CA mutation, was statistically correlated with
decreased beneﬁt from trastuzumab in patients with metastatic HER2þ breast cancer (15–19). Treatment with the PI3K
inhibitor XL147 prevented growth and/or induced apoptosis in
all trastuzumab-resistant cells, thus conﬁrming their dependence on PI3K. Even though trastuzumab alone had no effect,
combining trastuzumab with the PI3K inhibitor resulted in
additive effects compared with XL147 alone.

Rexer and Arteaga

Induction of apoptosis of primary breast tumors after
neoadjuvant trastuzumab, as measured by cleaved caspase-3
immunohistochemisty, has been reported previously (20). The
current study provides mechanistic insights into how HER2
function is connected to apoptosis by exploring differences
between antibody-sensitive and resistant cells. The investigators ﬁrst noted that survivin, a member of the inhibitor of
apoptosis family of proteins, was the only apoptosis-related
protein modulated upon treatment with the combination of
XL147 and trastuzumab. In antibody-sensitive cells, survivin is
downregulated by trastuzumab alone, whereas in resistant
cells, addition of a PI3K inhibitor to trastuzumab is required
to achieve such effect on survivin levels. In this case, blockade
of PI3K–AKT inhibits the phosphorylation of FoxO factors,
which, in turn, translocate to the nucleus, where they repress
the transcription of survivin. Furthermore, modulation of FoxO
function using dominant-negative or constitutively active
FoxO mutants uncoupled survivin from PI3K signaling. An
interesting aspect of these studies is the demonstration that
downregulation of survivin was sufﬁcient to restore sensitivity
to trastuzumab in drug-resistant cells.
Another interesting ﬁnding from this work was the observation that treatment of trastuzumab-resistant cell lines with
PI3K inhibitors reduced their cancer stem cell (CSC) fraction.
These CSCs or tumor-initiating cells are hypothesized to be
resistant to therapy and thus are able to repopulate the tumor
after treatment, potentially accounting for cancer recurrences
(21). Therefore, strategies that eliminate CSCs may overcome
drug resistance and prevent cancer relapses. In trastuzumabsensitive HER2 gene–ampliﬁed tumors, the antibody has been
proposed to target this CSC fraction (22, 23). In the resistant
cells used in this study, treatment with XL147, but not
trastuzumab, reduced CSCs as measured by mammosphere
formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and
interleukin (IL)-8 expression. Again, the combination of trastuzumab with the PI3K inhibitor was more effective in some
cases even though trastuzumab itself had little effect. Derepression of FoxO-mediated transcription also explained the
effects of IL-8. Knockdown via siRNA of FoxO3a upregulated
IL-8 mRNA levels as well as mammosphere formation. Survivin also played a role in maintenance of the CSC fraction, as
downregulation of survivin with siRNAs decreased mammosphere formation and ALDH activity.
Next, this study tested the combination of trastuzumab and
XL147 in athymic mice with established trastuzumab-resistant
human tumors. In two different resistant xenografts, treatment
with trastuzumab and the PI3K inhibitor blocked PI3K signaling, reduced ALDH1 and IL-8, both markers of stem-like cells,
and survivin levels. Finally, the authors explored the role of
survivin in patients with HER2þ breast cancer treated with
neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. Survivin mRNA
levels in tumors were signiﬁcantly reduced after treatment in 5
of 13 patients who exhibited a clinical response. Furthermore,
in tumors of patients who did not have a response, survivin
mRNA levels were statistically higher than those in patients
who responded.
In summary, this work is the ﬁrst to elucidate molecular
mechanisms of combined inhibition of HER2þ breast cancer

cells with trastuzumab and a PI3K inhibitor. This research also
shows a link between HER2, PI3K signaling, tumor cell apoptosis, and cancer stem-like cell maintenance through FoxOmediated suppression of survivin and IL-8 (Fig. 1). We speculate
that both of these cellular effects, induction of apoptosis and
elimination of CSCs, may explain the ability of (1 year) adjuvant
trastuzumab to completely eradicate micrometastases and
potentially induce cures. During early therapy, the major effect
of trastuzumab may be to elicit apoptotic and antisignaling
responses, whereas longer therapy is required to eradicate the
smaller, more intrinsically refractory CSC fraction.
This preclinical study also raises questions regarding the
clinical development of combinations of PI3K and HER2
antagonists in HER2þ breast cancer. Should PI3K and HER2
inhibitors be combined upfront, or should the PI3K inhibitor be

Targeting HER2–PI3K Signaling in Breast Cancer

p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor be superior to a pan-PI3K inhibitor in
this setting? Should all patients be treated with PI3K inhibitors
in combination with trastuzumab? Or should this combinatorial approach be reserved for those patients with HER2þ
tumors that also harbor mutations in the PI3K pathway? For
what duration should the PI3K inhibitor be used in combination with trastuzumab? Perhaps the mechanistic insights provided by this study can assist in the answers to these questions.
First, the authors noted that even in antibody-sensitive cells,
addition of the PI3K inhibitor resulted in a greater magnitude of
response compared with trastuzumab alone. This may not be
surprising, given the importance of sustained inhibition of PI3K
signaling that is required for the antitumor effect of trastuzumab (4, 6). Another rationale for the simultaneous use of both
inhibitors is the ability of trastuzumab to interfere with the
enhanced HER2–HER3 dimerization resulting from compensatory FoxO-dependent upregulation of HER3 mRNA and protein that has been reported following the inhibition of PI3K–Akt
(24, 25). In preclinical studies, trastuzumab was only a partial
inhibitor of HER2–HER3 signaling to PI3K. Hence, not surprisingly, clinical studies have shown superior efﬁcacy of "double
HER2 blockade" with combinations of trastuzumab with lapatinib or trastuzumab with pertuzumab, compared with lapatinib or trastuzumab alone, respectively (26, 27). Obviously, the
tolerability and efﬁcacy of a HER2–PI3K targeting strategy will
require testing in the clinic. If toxicities limit such a combination, data in this report would support a sequential strategy
whereby addition of a PI3K inhibitor at the time of progression
on trastuzumab could restore sensitivity to the antibody. This
would be in line with controlled clinical trials showing the
merits of continuing trastuzumab at the time of progression
(27–29). An alternative approach that may also avoid the
toxicity of a pan-PI3K inhibitor would be use of a p110a
isoform–speciﬁc inhibitor. Recent studies in the HER2/neu
transgenic mouse model of HER2þ breast cancer showed the
requirement for p110a for cancer growth and progression and
showed that selective targeting of p110a but not p110b was
effective at blocking growth of the transgenic tumors (30).
Ideally, only patients who are likely to develop resistance to
trastuzumab should be selected for treatment with the HER2–
PI3K–targeted combination. However, at the present time,
biomarkers that predict de novo or acquired resistance are
unknown. The PI3K–FOXO–survivin mechanism outlined in
this study suggests that measurement of pretreatment survivin
levels may aid in identifying patients who are less likely to
respond to trastuzumab. Survivin expression alone has been
shown to correlate with poorer outcome in breast cancer (31),
and survivin is one of 16 genes in the 21-gene Oncotype DX
recurrence score used for risk stratiﬁcation of patients with ERþ

HER2-negative breast cancer (32). We speculate that survivin
expression in addition to biomarkers of aberrant PI3K activation, such as PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss, should provide
a more robust predictor than any parameter alone.
Finally, the reduction in the tumor-initiating cell fraction
upon treatment with XL147 and trastuzumab raises the question of whether these inhibitors should be tested in the adjuvant
setting as well as the metastatic setting. We speculate that
through targeting the stem cell fraction by adding a PI3K
antagonist to adjuvant therapy, the duration of adjuvant trastuzumab could be reduced while maintaining or even improving its efﬁcacy. This will be a difﬁcult question to answer directly
given the required size of a clinical trial to test such a question.
One alternative might be to test whether the rate of pathologic
complete response after neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy is
improved by the addition of a PI3K inhibitor. The Neo-ALTTO
study showed an improvement in the rate of pathologic complete response using the combination of trastuzumab with
lapatinib versus either drug alone (33), so it would be feasible
to compare the effect of dual blockade with or without a PI3K
inhibitor in this setting. Indeed, the success of a therapeutic
combination identiﬁed in the neoadjuvant setting may serve as
a surrogate predictor of long-term clinical beneﬁt (34).
In conclusion, the data presented in this article underscore
the importance of PI3K signaling in HER2-mediated tumor
progression. The results extend our understanding of how the
HER2–PI3K axis modulates downstream effectors of apoptosis
and maintenance of tumor-initiating cells. Important questions remain as to how to best incorporate PI3K inhibitors into
the treatment of HER2þ breast cancer, but there is an increasing consensus that they should be considered as an integral
part of HER2-targeted combinations.
