ABSTRACT:
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway is involved in certain
human cancers, and the feasibility of directly targeting the IGF receptor has been
actively investigated. However, recent evidence from clinical trials suggests that this
approach can be problematic. We have developed an alternative strategy to indirectly
inhibit the IGF signaling by targeting the metalloproteinase, pregnancy-associated
plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). PAPP-A associated with the cell surface cleaves IGF
binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4), when IGF is bound to IGFBP-4, and thereby increases
IGF bioavailability for receptor activation in an autocrine/paracrine manner. We
hypothesized that inhibition of PAPP-A would suppress excessive local IGF signaling
in tissues where this is caused by increased PAPP-A proteolytic activity. To test this
hypothesis, we developed an inhibitory monoclonal antibody, mAb 1/41, which targets
a unique substrate-binding exosite of PAPP-A. This inhibitor selectively and specifically
inhibits proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP-4 with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 135 pM. In
addition, it inhibited intracellular signaling of the IGF receptor (AKT phosphorylation)
in monolayers of A549 cells, an IGF-responsive lung cancer-derived cell line found to
express high levels of PAPP-A. We further showed that mAb 1/41 is effective towards
PAPP-A bound to cell surfaces, and that it is capable of inhibiting PAPP-A activity
in vivo. Using a murine xenograft model of A549 cells, we demonstrated that mAb
1/41 administered intraperitoneally significantly inhibited tumor growth. Analysis
of xenograft tumor tissue recovered from treated mice showed penetration of mAb
1/41, reduced IGFBP-4 proteolysis, and reduced AKT phosphorylation. Our study
provides proof of concept that IGF signaling can be selectively reduced by targeting
a regulatory proteinase that functions extracellularly, upstream of the IGF receptor.
PAPP-A targeting thus represents an alternative therapeutic strategy for inhibiting
IGF receptor signaling.

INTRODUCTION

One such IGF-releasing enzyme is the
metalloproteinase, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A
(PAPP-A), whose known substrates are IGFBP-4 [18]
and -5 [19]. While several different proteinases are
capable of cleaving IGFBP-5, physiological cleavage
of IGFBP-4 may be limited to PAPP-A, suggesting that
in the IGF system, PAPP-A and IGFBP-4 function as
an interdependent pair [20, 21]. PAPP-A may therefore
comprise a desirable therapeutic target to inhibit focal
growth where an excessive level of bioactive IGF is
caused by increased PAPP-A proteolytic activity. By
using such a strategy, fewer side effects are likely because
tissues where PAPP-A is absent will not be affected. To
test the hypothesis that IGF-IR stimulation can be reduced
by inhibition of PAPP-A, we generated a monoclonal
antibody that selectively inhibits the cleavage of IGFBP-4
by targeting a unique substrate-binding exosite of PAPP-A,
analyzed its efficacy in vitro, and assessed the principle in
vivo by using a mouse xenograft model.

The insulin-like growth factor receptor type I (IGFIR) and its native ligands, IGF-I and IGF-II, play crucial
regulatory roles in many cellular processes, particularly
during normal development and growth [1, 2]. In addition,
dysregulated IGF-IR signaling has been linked to various
diseases, especially cancer [3-6]. In fact, the relationship
between the IGF system and cancer has been extensively
studied for decades. It includes early evidence that cancer
cell lines secrete IGF-I [7], express the IGF-IR on their
surface [8], and that IGF-IR is required for embryonic
cells to be transformed by oncogenes [9]. Furthermore,
numerous epidemiological studies have linked the
circulating level of IGF-I to cancer risk [5, 10].
For these reasons it is not surprising that major
efforts have focused on targeting IGF-IR signaling in
cancer therapy. Several different strategies have been
developed, including the use of 1) anti-ligand antibodies
to reduce the concentration of bioactive ligand capable
of stimulating the receptor, 2) anti-receptor antibodies,
which trigger receptor internalization and block binding
of active IGF-I or -II, and 3) small molecule inhibitors of
the intracellular receptor tyrosine kinase domain [11, 12].
Although all of these strategies have made the transition
into clinical trials, each of them is connected with potential
problems, and the outcomes have been less fruitful than
anticipated [13, 14].
Some of the problems arise from the fact that IGF
signaling is similar structurally and functionally to insulin
signaling with shared intracellular signaling machinery
and homologous receptor subunits, capable of forming
hybrid receptors [15]. Structural similarity also poses a
problem for the use of kinase inhibitors, which are likely
to inhibit the kinase domain of both receptors [13]. In
addition, cancer cells frequently express the A-isoform
of the insulin receptor (IR), which lacks exon 11 (IR-A)
[16]. IR-A has high affinity for both insulin and IGFII, but is not targeted by IGF-IR blocking antibodies.
Furthermore, the IGF-IR has widespread occurrence,
and it is increasingly recognized that therapeutic, global
manipulation of the receptor may have undesirable side
effects related to metabolism, some of which had not been
predicted prior to clinical trials [13].
A fundamental difference between insulin and
IGF signaling is the mechanisms that control the level
of bioactive ligand. In contrast to insulin signaling,
IGF signaling is often based on local synthesis of either
IGF-I or -II. The IGFs are present in tissues at relatively
high concentrations, but at the same time, their ability
to interact with IGF-IR is counteracted by differentially
expressed IGF binding proteins, IGFBP-1 through -6. The
high-affinity complexes of IGFBP and IGF constitute a
local reservoir from which bioactive IGF can be released
by different mechanisms, principally enzymatic cleavage
of the IGFBP [17].

RESULTS
Targeting the proteolytic activity of PAPP-A
towards IGFBP-4
The C-terminally located LNR3 module of PAPP-A
(Fig. 1A) harbors a unique substrate-binding exosite,
which is required for binding and proteolytic cleavage of
IGFBP-4 [22, 23]. To develop an inhibitory monoclonal
antibody targeting this site, mice were immunized with
full-length human PAPP-A. PAPP-A knockout mice [24]
were used to ensure an efficient immune response towards
conserved regions of the protein, in particular the LNR3
region which is highly conserved between species [25].
Antibodies secreted by hybridoma clones were screened
successively for 1) recognition of the immunogen, 2)
recognition of a recombinant C-terminal fragment of
PAPP-A containing the target site (Fig. 1A and 1B), and
3) for lack of recognition of mutant PAPP-A(D1484A), in
which the structure of LNR3 is disrupted [26]. Selected
candidates were then screened for their ability to inhibit
PAPP-A cleavage of IGFBP-4, and one antibody, mAb
1/41, was chosen for further characterization following
production in milligram quantities. In reducing SDSPAGE, this IgG2a antibody migrated as two distinct
bands, suggesting homogenously glycosylation of its
subunits (Fig. 1C). Qualitative analysis demonstrated that
mAb 1/41 efficiently inhibited the cleavage of IGFBP-4
by both human and murine PAPP-A (Fig. 1D). Cleavage
of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A2 [27], the only other homologous
proteinase (Fig. 1A), was not affected by mAb 1/41
(Fig. 1E), even at a large molar excess (10.000 fold) of
mAb 1/41 over PAPP-A2. Analysis by surface plasmon
resonance confirmed the suspected high-affinity binding

of the antibody to the target site of recombinant PAPP-A
(KD = 97 pM) (Fig. 2A), and by kinetic analysis, mAb 1/41
qualified as a potentially useful reagent for inhibition of
PAPP-A activity with a favorable inhibitory constant (Ki)
of 135 pM (Fig. 2B).

Specific and IGF-dependent proteolytic cleavage of
IGFBP-4 has previously been documented in conditioned
media from non-small cell lung cancer cell lines [28],
although the identity of the responsible proteinase was
unknown then. Recently, the level of circulating PAPP-A
was found to be increased in patients with lung cancer
[29]. We therefore screened a panel of human lung cancer
derived cells (Table 1), and picked the adenocarcinoma
cell line, A549, as a model for PAPP-A-mediated
stimulation of the IGF receptor based on its high level of
PAPP-A secretion.
Using the A549 cell line, we assessed the ability of
mAb 1/41 to inhibit IGF receptor signaling measured as
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in cultured monolayers
of adherent cells (Fig. 3A). Compared to untreated cells,
the addition of IGF-I caused a six-fold enhancement of
AKT phosphorylation; a similar enhancement (fourfold) was observed with IGF-I pretreated with equimolar
amounts of IGFBP-4. This might seem contradictory,
considering the inhibitory action of IGFBP-4. However,
IGF-I is released from the inactive IGF/IGFBP-4 complex
by the high levels of PAPP-A secreted by the A549 cells.
In agreement with this, we observed a dramatic decrease
in AKT phosphorylation when the cells treated with the
IGF/IGFBP-4 complex were also treated with inhibitory
mAb 1/41. The effect appeared to be saturable and to

To verify at the level of proteolysis that mAb 1/41
was capable of inhibiting the native PAPP-A secreted
from the A549 cells, culture medium from these cells was
treated with a variable amount of mAb 1/41, or a control
antibody of the same subtype. The control antibody had
no effect on the proteolytic activity towards IGFBP-4,
while mAb 1/41 efficiently inhibited cleavage (Fig. 3B).

PAPP-A (Fig. 1), but also native PAPP-A can be targeted

monitored. For both the high and the low dose, the level
of antibody had decreased to about 65% of the initial
concentration following eight days.

Assessment of the ability of mAb 1/41 to inhibit
PAPP-A activity in vivo
To address the question whether mAb 1/41 is
a functional inhibitor of PAPP-A in vivo, mice were
administered the inhibitor or a control antibody
intraperitoneally. Four hours later, the mice were given
heparin to increase the concentration of PAPP-A present in
the circulation [30, 31], and trace amounts of radiolabeled
IGFBP-4 pre-bound with IGF-II was injected into the
tail vein. Proteolytic cleavage of the injected IGFBP-4
was then assessed by autoradiography of serum samples
separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). No cleavage of
IGFBP-4 was observed at the high dose of mAb 1/41.
At a lower dose, cleavage was not completely inhibited.
Eight days after injection of the antibody, faint traces of
IGFBP-4 cleavage fragments were present at both the high
and the low dose of antibody, although efficient inhibition
was still evident (Fig. 4B). We therefore conclude that
mAb 1/41 is capable of inhibiting PAPP-A present in the
extracellular environment of a living organism. By using
flow cytometry, we further demonstrated that mAb 1/41 is
capable of binding the fraction of PAPP-A that in vivo is
likely to be bound to surfaces of cells [30] (Fig. 4C).
Finally, we assessed the pharmacokinetic properties
of mAb 1/41 in mice (Fig. 4D). A high (30 mg/kg) and
a low (3.0 mg/kg) dose of the antibody were injected
intraperitoneally, and the circulating levels were

DISCUSSION

1/41, or an subtype control antibody. Following onset of
treatment, the tumor sizes were measured twice weekly
for two weeks. The animals were then sacrificed and the
tumor masses were determined by weighing. Treatment
with mAb 1/41 showed a significant reduction in growth
rate (Fig. 5A), most prominent until day 15, where the
total reduction was greater than 50%. The difference in
tumor mass at harvest (day 21) was significant between
the two groups (Fig. 5B).
The ability of tumor extracts to proteolyze IGFBP-4
was then assessed. As expected, extracts from mice treated
with the inhibitory antibody showed a clear reduction in
proteolysis (Fig. 6A). Concordantly, we found a significant
reduction in IGF signaling, as measured by AKT
phosphorylation, between the groups (Fig. 6B). Finally, we
verified by IgG2a immunostaining that the antibody was
present in the xenograft tissue at the end of the experiment
(Fig. 6C). Although, based on this experiment, it is not
possible to determine the degree of mAb 1/41 penetration,
the presence of the antibody within the tissue is evident
and most likely the reason for the reduced IGF signaling.

Despite the enormous interest in therapeutic
manipulation of IGF signaling, very few efforts have
been made to target upstream regulatory molecules in the
extracellular part of the IGF signaling network. Use of
IGFBPs to sequester IGF bioactivity is being attempted
[15], but there are no prior reports in which the proteolytic
activity of an IGFBP proteinase has been targeted.
Reasons for that might be that some proteinases shown
to cleave IGFBPs, e.g. matrix metallloproteinases, are
known to be involved in proteolytic regulation outside the
IGF system [17]. Hence, proteolytic targeting clearly can
have unwanted and unpredictable consequences. For two
reasons we believe that targeting of PAPP-A is different:
First, targeting the substrate-binding exosite of PAPP-A
selectively inhibits cleavage of IGFBP-4 [22, 23]. Second,
IGFBP-4 is cleaved in an unusual IGF-dependent manner
by PAPP-A [19], and does not appear to be a physiological
substrate of other proteinases [20, 21].
By immunizing PAPP-A knockout mice, we have
developed a prototype PAPP-A inhibitor in the form of a
monoclonal antibody, mAb 1/41, that targets the substratebinding exosite, present in the highly conserved C-terminal
LNR module (LNR3) of PAPP-A. The antibody binds
PAPP-A with picomolar affinity (KD = 97 pM), is specific
for PAPP-A, and shows excellent inhibitory kinetics (Ki
of = 135 pM) towards the cleavage of IGFBP-4 for both
human and murine PAPP-A (Fig. 1 and 2).
Using cultured A549 cells, which secrete both
PAPP-A and IGFBP-4, we demonstrated that mAb
1/41 is capable of inhibiting both proteolytic cleavage
of IGFBP-4 and IGF signaling, the latter assessed by
measuring decreased AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3). This
experiment provides an in vitro model system in which
the coupled action of IGFBP-4 and PAPP-A regulates
IGF receptor stimulation. It is important to note that the
inhibitory antibody is effective towards native PAPP-A,
not only recombinant PAPP-A, which was used in the
selection process of the antibody. We further demonstrated
that mAb 1/41 is capable of exerting its inhibitory function
in vivo towards native murine PAPP-A (Fig. 4).
Cleavage of IGFBP-4 and resulting release of
bioactive IGF in close proximity to the IGF-IR is believed
to be important for efficient IGF-IR stimulation [20], in
agreement with the ability of PAPP-A to bind to cellular
surfaces [30]. Because the cell surface binding site of
PAPP-A is located in modules SCR3 and SCR4 (Fig.
1A), close to the LNR3 module containing the epitope
of mAb 1/41, the accessibility of the epitope of surfacebound PAPP-A might be compromised. However, the
simultaneous binding of PAPP-A to the cell surface and
to mAb 1/41 demonstrates that this is not the case (Fig.
4C). Therefore, mAb 1/41 can inhibit PAPP-A present in
tissues, where it is reasonable to assume that the majority
of PAPP-A is associated with cell surfaces.

To then test the hypothesis that targeting of PAPP-A
can indirectly reduce excessive IGF-IR stimulation in vivo,
we assessed the ability of mAb 1/41 to inhibit growth
in a xenograft mouse model based on subcutaneously
implanted A549 cells (Fig. 5). We found, in agreement
with our hypothesis, that inhibition of PAPP-A decreased
the tumor growth rate, even in this experimental system
with secretion from A549 cells being extremely high
compared to measured physiological levels of the protein.
Our results therefore provide proof of principle for a
strategy of targeting upstream extracellular components of
the IGF system in vivo to reduce IGF signaling locally. For
further studies, it may be desirable to substitute the current
heterotopic xenograft model with a more sophisticated
model system, in which extracellular IGF system
components are characterized, and dose and treatment
regimen can be optimized.
The involvement of PAPP-A in the development
or growth of different types of cancer is increasingly
suggested in the literature. These include ovarian cancer,
renal cancer, mammary cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer,
and pleural mesothelioma [29, 32-41]. Furthermore,
studies in mice have shown that PAPP-A transcription is
activated by mutant p53 [42], and, of particular interest,
PAPP-A null mice have a markedly reduced incidence of
spontaneous cancers of age [43]. Finally, recent reports
demonstrate that a shRNA- [39] or siRNA-mediated [41]
reduction in PAPP-A gene expression causes reduced

tumor cell proliferation in xenograft models.
It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that in some
cancers, where the tumor phenotype is driven by increased
IGF signaling, increased PAPP-A activity may be part of
the underlying mechanism. In these cases inhibition of
PAPP-A might be beneficial – and include the advantage
of local and indirect targeting of the IGF-IR, rather than
direct global targeting which lacks specificity and is likely
to interfere with metabolism. Importantly in this regard,
the PAPP-A knockout mice do not show secondary
endocrine alterations [24].
Furthermore, PAPP-A may serve as a predictive
biomarker to identify probable responders, the lack of
which is currently recognized as a major problem in
cancer treatment based on IGF-IR antagonists [44]. In
line with this, it is also possible that IGFBP-4 cleavage
fragments, generated by PAPP-A activity, have biomarker
value, either for patient selection or as a tool to monitor
efficacy of the treatment.
In conclusion, we have developed the concept
of indirect inhibition of IGF-IR signaling by inhibiting
a proteolytic enzyme, PAPP-A. Inhibition of PAPP-A
prevents the generation of bioactive IGF by specific
cleavage of IGFBP-4, and we have demonstrated that this
local targeting approach works in vivo. The advantage
of targeting PAPP-A is principally increased specificity,
fewer side effects, as well as its potential use as a
biomarker. Future work will aim at optimizing the efficacy

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM
glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and gentamicin
(Invitrogen). Cells were plated onto 6-cm tissue culture
dishes and transiently transfected 18 h later by calcium
phosphate co-precipitation using 10 µg of plasmid DNA.
The plasmids encoded the following: Wild-type human

of plasmid PA(1133–1547) [22], encoding a C-terminal
fragment of human PAPP-A, starting at SCR module 1,
PAPP-A(1133-1547). After 48 h, the culture media were
harvested and cleared by centrifugation, or the cells
were further cultured in serum free medium, CD293
(Invitrogen), to facilitate purification. Tagged proteins
were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using
Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (1 ml) (Amersham

and cleavage reactions (t = 60 min) were carried out in
50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5,
in the presence of a molar excess of IGF-II (Diagnostic
Systems Laboratories) at 37 °C. Concentrations were:
PAPP-A, 200 pM; IGFBP-4, 10 nM; IGF-II, 100 nM. In
some reactions, purified antibody was added in known
amounts as specified. Reactions were terminated by the
addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with
25 mM EGTA. For kinetic analysis, reaction times were
0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Cleavage products were separated
by 10-20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.
The degree of cleavage was determined by quantification
of band intensities using a Typhoon imaging system
(GE Healthcare), and background levels (mock signals)
were subtracted. Relative initial velocities (Vi/V0) were
determined by linear regression assuming no substrate
depletion. Quantitative analyses for inhibitory constant
(Ki) determination were carried out with GraphPad Prism
5.0 software using the Morrison Ki model (competitive
inhibition). For semi-quantitative experiments, unlabeled
IGFBP-4 (R&D Systems) was used, and proteolytic
activity was assessed by the separation of cleavage
products in Western blotting. Briefly, samples were
separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF
membrane (Millipore), blocked with LI-COR blocking
buffer, and probed for the N- and C-terminal fragment
of IGFBP-4 using specific antibodies (ab92625 and
ab153654, Abcam) by incubation for 20 h at 4°C.
Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (LI-COR)
were used for detection of intact and cleaved IGFBP-4,
images were captured using a LI-COR Odyssey scanner,
and intensities measured using the Image J software.
Cleavage (t = 30 min at 37 °C) of IGFBP-5 by human

Generation of inhibitory antibody
PAPP-A knockout mice [24] were immunized
with human PAPP-A complex purified from human
pregnancy serum [48]. Initial injections of 50 μg were
given subcutaneously in Freund’s Complete Adjuvant
(MP Biomedical, 0855828). After one month, each mouse
was given a booster injection in Freund’s Incomplete
Adjuvant (MP Biomedical, 0855829). Based on screening
of tail blood on plates coated with the antigen, good
responders were selected for final boosting following
one additional month: For four consecutive days,
mice received approximately 160 μg of the antigen
intraperitoneally. On the fifth day, the mice were sacrificed
and the spleens removed aseptically. Spleen cells were
centrifuged, aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Fusion with SP2/0 cells was performed with one aliquot
of the spleen cells. Culture supernatants of picked clones
were screened on antigen coated plates, and positive
clones were re-cloned. The clones were then screened

Flow cytometry

PAPP-A2 was carried out as previously detailed [27],
using 10 nM IGFBP-5, 100 nM IGF-II, 100 pM PAPP-A2
and a variable concentration (0-1000 nM) of mAb 1/41.

Transfected 293T cells were detached with 20 mM
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 containing 5mM EDTA
48 h post-transfection with PAPP-A cDNA and washed
with cold culture medium containing 5% FBS. The cells
were incubated on ice with primary antibody (mAb 1/41)
diluted in culture medium with 10% FBS to 0.5 µg/ml for
1 h. After washing three times, the cells were incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse diluted to 2 µg/ml
for 1 h. After 3 washes, the cells were suspended in PBS
with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a Beckman
Coulter FC500 instrument. At least 10,000 cells were
analyzed.

Surface plasmon resonance analysis
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were
carried out on a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare). Purified
antibody was captured in flow cell 2 of a protein A coupled
PAD 500L chip (XanTec Bioanalytics) to a density of 100
response units. To collect kinetic binding data, a twofold
serial dilution of the analyte, PAPP-A(1133-1547),
ranging from 6.25 nM to 97.5 pM, in 10 mM HEPES pH
7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween-20,
was injected over flow cells 1 and 2 at 30 μl/min. The
association phase was 180 s, followed by a 600 s
dissociation phase. Binding analysis was performed at 25
°C. At the end of each binding cycle, all surfaces were
regenerated by a 60 s injection of 10 mM glycine pH 1.7.
Analyte concentrations were determined by amino acid
analysis. Data were collected at a rate of 10 Hz. Recorded
signals were subtracted the background signal, as
determined by the response obtained from a reference cell
(flow cell 1) without antibody capture. Global fitting of
a 1:1 Langmuir model was performed, using the Biacore
T200 Evaluation Software, version 1.0

Analysis of IGFBP-4 cleavage in vivo
Adult, male FVB mice (Charles River Laboratories)
were administered control IgG2a (BioXCell) or PAPP-A
mAb 1/41 by intra-peritoneal injection of 3.0 or 30 mg/
kg. Serum was collected from previously antibodytreated mice by eye bleed at various time points for the
determination of circulating levels of PAPP-A mAb
1/41 (eBioscience). At 24 h and 8 days post injection of
antibody, the inhibitory potential in the circulation was
assessed: Mice were administered 10 U heparin (Sigma)
(to release cell surface-associated PAPP-A) followed
by radiolabeled IGFBP-4 (cf. above) and IGF-II via tail
vein injection. Animals were sacrificed 10 minutes after
the injection of trace amounts of 125I-labeled IGFBP-4.
Serum was collected and stored at -80 prior to separation
by 4-20% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed
to X-ray films (Kodak) for visualization of IGFBP-4
proteolysis.

Determination of AKT phosphorylation
A panel of human lung cancer derived cell lines
(ATCC, Table 1) were assessed by ELISA for the presence
of PAPP-A in the culture medium. Human alveolar
adenocarcinoma cells (A549, ATCC) [50] were selected
and thereafter maintained in DMEM containing 10%
FBS, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. The
cells were allowed to reach confluence in a 96-well plate,
washed three times and switched to DMEM containing
antibiotics and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 16 hours
to allow PAPP-A secretion and accumulation in the
medium. Varying doses of an irrelevant control IgG2a
antibody (BioXCell) or PAPP-A mAb 1/41 were added 1
h prior to the addition of recombinant human IGF-I (50
ng/ml, R&D Systems), or IGF-I and human recombinant
IGFBP-4 (50/500 ng/ml, R&D Systems) pre-incubated for
30 minutes to allow the IGF/IGFBP-4 complex to form.
Fifteen minutes after IGF stimulation, conditioned media
were collected and cells fixed and permeabilized for InCell Western analysis (LI-COR). An anti-phospho-AKT
antibody (Novus Biologicals) was used to assess IGF
receptor signaling using the LI-COR Odyssey system.
Levels of PAPP-A were determined by ELISA (AL-101,
Ansh Labs).

Xenograft model
Adult, female athymic nude mice (Charles River
Laboratories) were allowed to acclimatize for one week
following delivery to the animal facility. The mice were
housed in pathogen-free conditions for the duration of the
study. A549 cells were propagated, lifted by trypsinization,
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and counted. Animals (n = 15 per group) were delivered
5.0 x 105 cells suspended in a volume of 100 µl PBS
subcutaneously mid-thigh. The mice were followed for
six days, and tumor volumes (in mm2) were determined
by two-dimensional caliper measurement using the
modified ellipsoid formula, Vt = ½ (L x W2), where L =
length in mm, and W = width in mm, and randomized to
treatment group. Treatments were initiated at day 6 by
intraperitoneal injections of control IgG2a or PAPP-A
mAb 1/41 at 10 mg/kg. A second dose was given one
week later for a total of two treatments. Tumor volumes

were determined every three days. The animals were
sacrificed three weeks after xenografting, the tumors
were weighed, and serum was collected. Portions of the
tumor were flash-frozen for biochemical analysis or OCTembedded for immunohistochemistry and stored at -80
until further analysis. The levels of AKT phosphorylation
in tumor extracts from mice treated with mAb 1/41 (n
= 6) or control IgG2a (n = 5) were assessed as above.
Tumor extracts were also assessed for the ability to cleave
IGFBP-4. All protocols involving animals were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Mayo Clinic.
