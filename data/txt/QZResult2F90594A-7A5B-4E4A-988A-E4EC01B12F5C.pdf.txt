BACKGROUND: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the ability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to predict chemosensitivity in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients underwent 18FFDG PET/CT scanning at baseline and after the second course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The evolution (D) between the 2
scans of image parameters (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax], SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis [TLG]) was measured. Correlations between early changes in PET-derived parameters and pathologic response observed in surgical specimens after the completion of 8 courses of NAC were estimated with Mann-Whitney U tests. Response prediction on the
basis of clinical data, histologic type, or molecular markers also was assessed (Fisher exact test). Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis was used to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of each parameter. RESULTS: The best prediction of chemosensitivity was obtained with DTLG (49%  31% in nonresponders vs 73%  25% in responders; P <.0001). Among the biologic parameters, only negative progesterone receptor status (57% responders vs 31% nonresponders; P ¼.04) and luminal B subtype (63%
responders vs 22% nonresponders; P ¼.02) were predictive of a pathologic response. ROC analysis resulted in an AUC of 0.81, 0.73,
0.71, and 0.63 for DTLG, DSUVmax, luminal subtype, and progesterone receptor status, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When patients
responded to NAC, the majority of ER-positive/HER2 negative tumors exhibited partial tumor shrinkage; and the PET parameters that
combined volume and activity measurements, such as TLG, offered better accuracy for early prediction than the SUVmax. Negative
progesterone receptor status and luminal B subtype had weaker predictive power than PET-derived parameters. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly offered to patients with locally advanced breast cancer and to women with
primary operable but large breast cancer. This strategy allows more patients to undergo breast-conserving surgery and provides information on the efficacy of chemotherapy. Breast carcinoma is a heterogeneous class of tumors, and gene-expression
profiling has led to the identification of 5 different subtypes with clinical implications (ie, luminal A, luminal B, basal-like,
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-like, and normal-like subtypes).1 To some degree, these molecular subtypes can be distinguished using immunohistochemistry.2 Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative (ERþ/HER2)
breast cancer regroups the majority of luminal A and B tumors. This important group is characterized by potential hormone
sensitivity and a relatively good prognosis, mainly for luminal A subtype.3 Chemosensitivity of ERþ/HER2 tumors is
variable and mostly limited.3-6 Therefore, factors that may help in predicting chemosensitivity are required.
Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is gaining importance for the staging of patients with large or locally advanced breast cancer.7 Also, an early change in 18F-FDG

uptake is a potential predictive biomarker of response to
NAC.8-12 However, at baseline, as demonstrated in recent
studies, ER-positive tumors are usually characterized by
rather low standardized uptake values (SUVs) because of
lower 18F-FDG uptake compared with other breast cancer phenotypes.8,10,11,13 Because of this limitation and
because of incomplete regression when ERþ/HER2
tumors are treated by NAC, PET parameters taking into
account volume measurements may be of interest in this
specific subgroup. The value of some PET-derived parameters as biomarkers, such as the metabolically active tumor
volume (MATV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), which
takes into account the MATV and the mean tumor SUV
(SUVmean), is being actively investigated in several malignancies.14-16 Given the potential of these new biomarkers,
their role in breast cancer deserves investigation.
The main objective of the current prospective study
was to investigate the value of several PET parameters
(SUVmean, maximum SUV [SUVmax]. MATV, and TLG)
for early tumor response prediction after 2 cycles of NAC
in ERþ/HER2 breast cancer. The second objective was
to compare PET performance with the performance of
several previously established molecular markers, such as
histologic type, tumor grade, progesterone receptor (PR)
expression, and luminal subtype.3,17
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Inclusion and Treatment

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the ability
of 18F-FDG PET/CT to predict chemosensitivity in
ERþ/HER2 breast cancer. From July 2007 to October
2011 (52 months), 64 consecutive patients with a large or
locally advanced breast carcinoma and an ERþ/HER2
phenotype underwent an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan before
treatment (PET1) and just before the third course of
chemotherapy (PET2). NAC is routinely used in our institution for large/locally advanced breast carcinoma, even
for luminal A tumors. Patients received 4 cycles of epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2
administered every 3 weeks, followed by 4 courses of
docetaxel 100 mg/m2. After the completion of NAC, all
patients underwent breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and axillary dissection. The study followed the
guidelines of the institutional ethical committee.
Histology, Immunohistochemistry,
and Molecular Biology

Tumor histology and biologic parameters were evaluated
on core-needle biopsy before NAC. Histologic grade was
determined using the modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson
system.18

Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. All immunostainings were performed on an automated immunostainer
(Ventana XT; Ventana, Tucson, Ariz). Tumors that had
10% positive cells using ER antibody were considered
ER-positive.19 Tumors that had 10% positive cells
using PR antibody were considered PR-positive.19
Tumors were considered to overexpress c-erbB-2 oncoprotein (HER2-positive) if >30% of invasive tumor cells
had definite membrane staining that resulted in a
so-called fish net appearance.20 Control experiments with
fluorescence in situ hybridization or silver-enhanced in
situ hybridization were performed for ambiguous cases.
Ki67 was quantified by immunohistochemistry with
MIB-1. A Ki67 level <14% was considered low and was
associated with the luminal A subtype.21
Luminal A and B subclassification is a molecular
classification based on transcriptome analysis. To some
extent, however, ER-positive tumors, can be segregated
into ‘‘luminal A’’ and ‘‘luminal B’’ on the basis of PR
expression, Ki67 expression, and tumor grade.21,22 This is
convenient for the prediction of responsiveness to hormone therapy (luminal A > luminal B) and to chemotherapy (luminal B > luminal A). We considered luminal A
tumors as those with positive ER and PR expression, low
Ki67 expression, and/or low grade; all other tumors were
classified as luminal B. Note that the molecular definition
of luminal B also extends to some ER-positive and
HER2-overexpressing tumors,23 which were not included
in the current study.

F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission
Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging

Patients fasted for 6 hours and had to achieve a blood glucose level <7 mmol/L. 18F-FDG (5 megabecquerels/kg)
was administered into the arm opposite to the breast
tumor using a venous line to prevent extravasations. Imaging started 60 minutes after injection on a Philips Gemini
XL PET/CT scanner (Phillips Healthcare, Amsterdam,
the Netherlands). CT data were acquired first (120 kV,
100 mAs, no contrast enhancement). Three-dimensional
(3D) PET data were acquired with 2 minutes per bed
position and were reconstructed using a 3D row-action
maximum likelihood algorithm. The SUV was defined as
follows: (tracer concentration [kBq/mL])/(injected activity [kBq]/patient body weight [g]).
Image Analysis

The pathologic response was unknown by the team that
measured PET parameters. For each image, the tumor
was identified by a nuclear physician who had more than
1961

Original Article

10 years of experience and was isolated semiautomatically
in a volume of interest that contained the tumor and its
surrounding background. Tumors were subsequently
delineated using the Fuzzy Locally Adaptive Bayesian
(FLAB) algorithm24 applied to the previously defined volume of interest.
The MATV is the functional tumor volume that can
be observed and delineated on the PET image and is
different from morphologic tumor volume measured by
anatomic/morphologic imaging (ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging).25 It is determined by a number
of voxels with 18F-FDG uptake (reflecting viable tumor
cells) that is significantly higher than the uptake level in
background healthy tissues. To decide which voxels were
included in the MATV, we used an automatic image segmentation algorithm (FLAB) that was not based on the
use of thresholding but took into account, through iterative estimation, the following parameters: statistical noise
distributions in the image, partial volume effects specific
to PET imaging, and spatial correlation between voxels.
This method was previously validated against both simulated images and clinical images for accuracy and
robustness.24,26
The SUVmax, SUVmean, MATV, and TLG were
automatically calculated from the tumor delineations.
The SUVmax was defined as the maximum SUV value
within the MATV. The MATV was defined as the sum of
all voxels (64 mm3 each) included in the delineation. The
TLG was determined by multiplying the MATV and its
associated SUVmean. The percentage evolution of each
parameter between baseline and after the second NAC
cycle (Dparam) was calculated as follows: Dparam ¼
(param_PET2  param_PET1)/param_PET1  100.
Response assessment with PET is known as difficult
when the baseline 18F-FDG tumor uptake is low.10
Therefore, we performed analyses on the entire group of
64 patients and on those who had an initial SUVmax >3
(59 patients).
Pathologic Response

Histopathologic response was assessed on surgical specimens at the completion of NAC. Response was graded
according to the Sataloff scale in primary tumor (T) and
lymph nodes (N).27 On this scale, TA indicates a total or
near-total therapeutic effect; TB, >50% therapeutic effect
but less than total or near-total effect; TC, <50% therapeutic effect; TD, no therapeutic effect; NA, evidence of
therapeutic effect and no residual disease; NB, no lymph
node metastases or therapeutic effect; NC, evidence of a
therapeutic effect but metastasis still present; and ND,
1962

metastasis still present and viable, no therapeutic effect.
For the purpose of the current study, patients with TATB and NA-NB-NC scores were considered responders
(complete or partial response), and patients with TC-TD
and/or ND scores were considered nonresponders.27 The
percentage of patients who attained a pathologic complete
response (pCR) also was measured, with a pCR defined as
no residual invasive cancer in both breast tissues and
lymph nodes.28
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc
(MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Sample size was
calculated to assess the efficacy of PET-derived parameters
in predicting response with an AUC of approximately
0.85 considered significantly different from the null
hypothesis value of 0.5 (indicating no discriminating
power), with type I and II errors levels of 0.05, leading to
a required size of 31 patients per group,29 assuming a rate
of pathologic response (total þ partial responses) of 50%
based on previously published data.9
For each PET parameter, the correlation between
the response and the absolute values at baseline and after
the second cycle, as well as the evolution (D) between
baseline and the second cycle, was evaluated using the
Mann-Whitney U test. The predictive performance
regarding the identification of nonresponders was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Optimal cutoff values were determined based on the
highest Youden index.30
Some molecular markers are known to be somewhat
predictive of response to chemotherapy in ERþ/HER2
tumors. It has been suggested that positive PR status,3
luminal A status,3 and lobular histology type17 are associated with a poor response to NAC. The performance of
clinical data, histologic type, and molecular markers in
predicting a pathologic response was assessed by univariate analysis with the Fisher exact test.
ROC analysis was used to compare the areas under
the ROC curve (AUCs) of PET parameters and clinical
and molecular markers that were significant in the univariate analysis. All tests were 2-sided, and P values  .05
were considered statistically significant.

and 37 nonresponders (58%). Only 4 women (6%) had a
pCR (Table 1).
Predictive Value of Positron Emission
Tomography Parameters

Table 2 provides the 18F-FDG PET parameter values at
baseline (PET1), after 2 cycles (PET2), and the variation
in D(PET1, PET2). SUVmax values ranged between 2.1
and 15.8 (median SUVmax, 6.4) at PET1 and between 1.1
and 13.6 at PET2 (median SUVmax, 3.8). The SUVmax
decreased after 2 cycles in 59 of 64 patients, was
unchanged in 2 patients, and had a slight nonmeaningful
increase (þ2.0% to þ6.2%) in 3 patients.
No correlation was observed between histopathologic response and SUVmax values at baseline (P ¼ .8),
and a weak correlation was observed with SUVmax values
after the second cycle of chemotherapy (P ¼ .05). Variation in the SUVmax between PET1 and PET2 was more
predictive (Table 2): the median DSUVmax was
31%  20% in nonresponders versus 48%  18% in
pathologic responders (P ¼ .002). The optimal DSUVmax
cutoff value was 38% (Fig. 1a), with sensitivity of
62.2% and specificity of 77.8% for identifying nonresponders. The ability of DSUVmax to predict response was
assessed with an AUC of 0.73, whereas a lower predictive
value (0.67) was observed for DSUVmean.
On the 1 hand, no correlation was observed between
a pathologic response and TLG values measured at PET1
(P ¼ .9) or PET2 (P ¼ .07) (Table 2). Conversely, we
observed a strong correlation between DTLG and pathologic response. The median DTLG was 49%  31% in
nonresponders versus 73%  25% in responders
(P < .0001). The optimal DTLG cutoff value was 71%
(Fig. 1b), with sensitivity of 89.2% and specificity of
74.1% for identifying nonresponders. The AUC of TLG
for predicting pathology outcome was 0.81 compared
with 0.73 for DSUVmax (P ¼ .097) (Fig. 2a).
When we excluded the 5 patients who had an initial
SUVmax <3 (n ¼ 59), the performance of both DTLG
and DSUVmax improved, with superiority observed for
DTLG (AUC: 0.84 for DTLG vs 0.77 for DSUVmax;
P ¼ .038) (Fig. 2b).
Predictive Value of Clinical, Pathologic,
and Molecular Parameters

We observed no association between clinical findings
(patient age, menopausal status, tumor classification,
lymph node stage) and response (Table 3). A pathologic
response was more frequent in grade 3 tumors than in
lower grade tumors (62.5% vs 34.8%) and more frequent

in invasive ductal carcinoma than in invasive lobular carcinoma (47.3% vs 20%) without reaching statistical significance, but the number of women with invasive lobular
carcinoma was limited (n ¼ 5). Only PR status and
molecular subtype were identified as significantly predictive of response. The overall pathologic response rate
(total þ partial responses) was significantly higher in the
luminal B subgroup (62.5%; 20 of 32 tumors) than in the
luminal A subgroup (21.9%; 7 of 32 tumors; P ¼ .02).
Response was also more frequent in PR-negative tumors
than in PR-positive tumors (P ¼ .04).
Comparison of the Predictive Value of Positron
Emission Tomography Parameters and
Molecular Markers

In all 64 patients, ROC analysis led to an AUC of 0.81,
0.73, 0.71, and 0.63 for TLG, SUVmax, luminal subtype,
and PR status, respectively (Fig. 3a). DTLG was significantly more predictive than PR status (P ¼ .02), and the
difference was not significant between DTLG, DSUVmax,
and luminal subtype.
It is noteworthy that the subgroup analysis indicated
that DTLG still had value when considering the more responsive subtypes (PR-negative and luminal B). Among
the PR-negative patients, DTLG, DSUVmax, and luminal
B status provided AUCs of 0.90, 0.82, and 0.58, respectively, in distinguishing the 16 responders from the 12
nonresponders (Fig. 3b); DTLG was significantly more
predictive than luminal B status (P ¼ .0001). For the 32
patients with luminal B tumors (Fig. 3c), DTLG was sig1964

nificantly more predictive than PR status (AUC, 0.85 vs
0.52; P ¼ .0064). DSUVmax had intermediate predictive
power (AUC, 0.75). The PET parameters were less predictive in the lower response rate subgroups; specifically,
PR-positive tumors (AUC: 0.69 for DTLG, 0.64 for
DSUVmax) and luminal A tumors (AUC: 0.76 for DTLG,
0.74 for DSUVmax).
DISCUSSION
The chemosensitivity of ERþ/HER2 tumors varies, is
mostly limited, and a pCR is rarely achieved.3-6 In a study
on the role of 18F-FDG PET in predicting a complete
response to NAC that involved different breast cancer
subtypes, only 1 of 53 patients with ERþ/HER2 disease
achieved a pCR.8 Thus, the authors could not evaluate the
role of 18F-FDG PET in that subgroup.8 In our current
study, 4 women (6%) achieved a pCR after 8 courses of
NAC. In ERþ/HER2 tumors, especially the luminal A
subtype, the impact of a pCR on patient survival remains
less established than in the triple-negative group (ER-negative, PR-negative, and no HER2 overexpression) and the
HER2-positive group6,31; and an intermediate response
with tumor shrinkage that allows breast-conserving surgery may be considered a reasonable clinical objective.11
We investigated the performance of 2 different PET
parameters in predicting response after 2 NAC cycles:
SUVmax, which is a simple parameter often used to
evaluate response to chemotherapy, and TLG, which
corresponds to the metabolically active tumor volume

multiplied by its associated SUVmean.15 All patients
underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning before treatment
and again after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. At surgery, 27
patients (42%) had a complete or partial pathologic
response, whereas the others were nonresponders. In
line with previous findings,10,12,32 a relative variation
in parameters between PET1 and PET2 was significantly more accurate in predicting response than the
absolute values at any time point. The best prediction
was observed with DTLG. Although a recent study
indicated that DSUVmax was superior to DTLG,32 the
tumor volumes were contoured with fixed thresholding, which a previous report indicated was inappropriate.33 In addition, all cancer subtypes were mixed
(ERþ/HER2, triple-negative, and HER2-positive),
and the endpoint was to predict pCR.32
The higher predictive value of DTLG over
DSUVmax that we observed in these ERþ/HER2
Cancer

tumors may have several explanations. Baseline 18F-FDG
uptake is weaker and the decrease in SUV during NAC is
lower than for other phenotypes,8,10,13 as demonstrated in
1 study (45%  25% and 57%  30%, respectively,
in the TN and HER2-positive subtypes versus
19%  35% in the ERþ/HER2 subtype;
P < .0001).8 In the current series, when taking into
account modifications in volume in addition to activity,
discrimination increased. DTLG values exhibited a greater
dispersion range than DSUVmax measurements (Fig. 1),
which also may contribute toward explaining its higher
discriminative power.
We observed no correlation between patient age,
menopausal status, tumor classification, lymph node status, and response. Only 2 biologic markers were associated significantly with response: PR status and luminal
subtype. These findings are in agreement with a report
from Lips and colleagues.3 However, these markers had
only weak accuracy, and those authors reported that the
decision to refrain from using NAC to treat ERþ/
HER2 breast tumors should be based not on predictive
biological markers but exclusively on estimates of prognosis.3 In the current study, biologic markers were less predictive than DTLG (Fig. 3).
Our study had some limitations. Although we identified TLG as superior to SUVmax in this patient population, the use of TLG requires robust and accurate MATV
delineation. Therefore, the results from this study remain
hypothesis-generating and need confirmation by larger
studies. It also would be interesting to compare the
predictive values of PET performed at 2 cycles with PET
performed at an earlier time point (1 cycle).8
Because a pCR is rare in ERþ/HER2 breast cancer, we chose to consider both pCRs and partial responses
(>50% therapeutic effect according to the Sataloff scale),
which also was used by Rousseau and colleagues.9 We
acknowledge that this definition of response is somewhat
arbitrary and less meaningful than an assessment of clinical outcome. However, correlation of changes in PET
parameters with outcomes would have been challenging,
requiring long-term follow-up, because recurrences in
ERþ/HER2 often occur late, several years after
surgery.34
Our study population included both subtypes of
luminal breast cancer. However, the response rate
(total þ partial responses) was higher for luminal B
tumors than for luminal A tumors (62.5% vs 21.9%;
P ¼ .02). Because patients with luminal A tumors are less
likely to respond, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy may be
an alternative to chemotherapy.4 It is noteworthy that

response prediction based on TLG was also more effective
in the luminal B subtype (AUC ¼ 0.85 vs 0.76 for luminal A tumors). Therefore, if chemotherapy is received
only by patients who have luminal B tumors, then prediction based on PET may be expected to yield excellent
results.
Future studies also should focus on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, especially for luminal A breast cancer. If
our study is replicated in this setting, then use of the preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score, which
has been correlated with patient outcomes,35 should be
preferred to the Sataloff scale. It will also be helpful in
future studies to compare PET parameters with other factors, such as gene expression signatures (Oncotype DX;
Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, Calif).36
In conclusion, our current results indicate that PET
parameters may help in predicting chemosensitivity of
ERþ/HER2 breast cancer early during treatment.
When they respond to neoadjuvant treatment, most of
these tumors exhibit partial tumor shrinkage, and parameters like TLG provide higher predictive accuracy than
SUVmax measurements.
