Abstract

Author Manuscript

In response to cell stress, cancer cells often activate the endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress
sensor, the unfolded protein response (UPR). Little was known about the potential role in cancer
of a different mode of UPR activation; anticipatory activation of the UPR prior to accumulation of
unfolded protein or cell stress. We show that estrogen, acting via estrogen receptor α (ERα),
induces rapid anticipatory activation of the UPR, resulting in increased production of the
antiapoptotic chaperone BiP/GRP78, preparing cancer cells for the increased protein production
required for subsequent estrogen-ERα induced cell proliferation. In ERα containing cancer cells,
the estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2) activates the UPR through a phospholipase C γ (PLCγ)-mediated
opening of EnR IP3R calcium channels, enabling passage of calcium from the lumen of the EnR
into the cytosol. siRNA knockdown of ERα blocked the estrogen-mediated increase in cytosol
calcium and UPR activation. Knockdown or inhibition of PLCγ, or of IP3R, strongly inhibited the
estrogen-mediated increases in cytosol calcium, UPR activation and cell proliferation. E2-ERα
activates all three arms of the UPR in breast and ovarian cancer cells in culture and in a mouse
xenograft. Knockdown of ATF6α, which regulates UPR chaperones, blocked estrogen induction
of BiP and strongly inhibited E2-ERα stimulated cell proliferation. Mild and transient UPR
activation by estrogen promotes an adaptive UPR response that protects cells against subsequent
UPR-mediated apoptosis. Analysis of data from ERα positive breast cancers demonstrates
elevated expression of a UPR gene signature that is a powerful new prognostic marker tightly
correlated with subsequent resistance to tamoxifen therapy, reduced time to recurrence and poor
survival. Thus, as an early component of the E2-ERα proliferation program, the mitogen estrogen,

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Estrogens, acting via estrogen receptor α (ERα), stimulate cell proliferation and tumor
growth.1–3 The importance of estrogens and ERα in breast cancer is illustrated by the central
role of endocrine therapy targeting estrogens and ERα in treatment of ERα+ breast
cancer.1–5 To help fold and sort the increased protein required for estrogen-ERα induced
cell proliferation, cells must increase chaperone levels. The endoplasmic reticulum (EnR)
stress sensor, the unfolded protein response (UPR) monitors and maintains protein-folding
homeostasis.6, 7 The UPR responds to misfolded proteins, or other forms of stress, by
activating three signal transduction pathways, which reduce protein production and increase
EnR protein-folding capacity. Protein production is regulated by autophosphorylation of the
stress-activated transmembrane kinase, PERK.6, 7 P-PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic
initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), resulting in transient inhibition of protein synthesis. The other
UPR arms initiate with proteolytic activation of the transcription factor ATF6α, leading to
increased chaperone production and activation of the EnR splicing factor IRE1α, which
alternatively splices the transcription factor XBP1, leading to production of active splicedXBP1, increased protein folding capacity and altered mRNA decay and translation.6, 7

The UPR is usually inactive in normal cells, but is overexpressed in several cancers.8
Chronic UPR activation leads to increased expression of EnR chaperones, such as BiP
(GRP78/HSAP5), p58IPK and calreticulin that facilitate protein folding and promote
survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to chemotherapy and endocrine
therapy.9–12 In the widely studied “reactive mode”, the UPR in tumor cells is activated in
response to accumulation of stress from rapid cell division, hypoxia and therapy. A few
studies in immune cells describe a different type of UPR activation; in this “anticipatory
mode”, the UPR is activated in the absence of EnR stress and prior to the accumulation of
unfolded proteins.13, 14 We explored whether estrogen induces anticipatory activation of the
UPR in the absence of EnR stress, increasing protein folding capacity prior to the increased
protein production and protein folding load that accompanies activation of the genomic
estrogen-ERα cell proliferation program. Previous studies of the UPR and of estrogen-ERα
action focused on the estrogen-inducible UPR gene, XBP1. XBP1 binds to and activates
ERα; XBP1 expression is associated with tamoxifen resistance in ERα+ breast cancer.15–18
The plasma membrane enzyme phospholipase C γ (PLCγ) hydrolyzes PIP2 to diacyglycerol
(DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). We show that the mitogen estrogen, 17βestradiol (E2), acting through a rapid extranuclear action of ERα, elicits a PLCγ-mediated
opening of EnR IP3R calcium channels, increasing cytosol calcium and triggering
anticipatory activation of each arm of the UPR. Opening the IP3R calcium channel and

activating the ATF6α arm of the UPR, resulting in BiP induction, are important for
subsequent E2-ERα induced cell proliferation. Consistent with an important role in cancer
for anticipatory activation of the UPR, analysis of data from ~1,000 ERα+ breast cancer
patients demonstrates that elevated expression of a UPR gene signature is tightly correlated
with subsequent resistance to tamoxifen therapy, time to tumor recurrence and poor survival.

RESULTS
Estrogen Activates all 3 Arms of the UPR

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the ability of E2-ERα to activate the UPR, we focused on production of spliced
and modified proteins that result from activating the three arms of the UPR (Supplementary
Figure 1). E2 rapidly activated the IRE1α arm of the UPR, as shown by increases in splicedXBP1 (sp-XBP1) mRNA in T47D and MCF-7 breast and PEO4 ovarian cancer cells (Figure
1a and b), and by induction of downstream sp-XBP1 targets, SERP1 and ERDJ
(Supplementary Figure 2a).19 The antiestrogens ICI 182,780/Faslodex/fulvestrant (ICI) and
4-hydroxytamoxifen, (4-OHT), which compete with E2 for binding to ERα, blocked the E2mediated increase in sp-XBP1 (Figure 1a). Consistent with E2-ERα activating the IRE1α
arm of the UPR, RNAi knockdown of ERα blocked E2-induction of sp-XBP1 mRNA
(Figure 1c), and induction of GREB1 by nuclear E2-ERα (Supplementary Figure 2b).

We next assessed whether estrogen activates the ATF6α arm of the UPR. ATF6α is a 90
kDa protein (p90-ATF6α) that translocates from the EnR to the Golgi in response to stress,
where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage to its active 50 kDa form (p50-ATF6α)
(Supplementary Figure 1b).6, 7, 20 Increased ATF6α proteolysis in T47D cells and PEO4
cells demonstrates that E2-ERα transiently activates the ATF6α arm of the UPR (Figure 1d;
Supplementary Figure 2c). Since pretreatment with ICI, abolished the E2-mediated increase
in p50-ATF6α, this effect is mediated through ERα (Figure 1d). Active cleaved ATF6α
regulates induction of BiP and other EnR chaperones.20, 21 Consistent with this, ATF6α
knockdown in T47D cells blocked BiP induction (Figure 1e). BiP increases EnR protein
folding capacity, contributing to resolution of the stress, and helps reverse UPR activation;
likely preventing the cytotoxicity that would result if UPR activation was sustained.
Consistent with its antiapoptotic role, in several cancers, elevated levels of BiP are
associated with a poor prognosis.9 Estrogen rapidly induced BiP mRNA in breast and
ovarian cancer cells (Figure 1f), leading to a 2.3-fold increase in BiP protein (Figure 1g).
RNAi knockdown of ERα prevented E2-induction of BiP mRNA (Figure 1h).

Author Manuscript

PERK activation leads to inhibition of protein synthesis (Supplementary Figure 1c).
Surprisingly, E2 induces a rapid and transient increase in PERK phosphorylation (Figure
2a), resulting in increased phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figure 2b) and a modest transient
decline in overall protein synthesis (Figure 2c). Consistent with p-PERK catalyzing
formation of p-eIF2α, PERK knockdown inhibited formation of p-eIF2α (Figure 2d).
Consistent with E2 acting through ERα, ICI inhibited E2-stimulated phosphorylation of
PERK and eIF2α and largely reversed the E2-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis
(Figure 2a, b, and c). PERK activation leads to ATF4 expression, and we observed a
transient increase in ATF4 expression (Figure 2e). However, the proapoptotic protein CHOP
was not induced because mild and transient activation of PERK does not induce CHOP

(Figure 2f; Supplementary Figure 2d).22 Together, this data demonstrates that E2, acting
through ERα, activates all three UPR arms.
E2-ERα Rapidly Increases Cytosol Ca2+ by a PLCγ-mediated Opening of the EnR IP3R Ca2+
Channel, Activating the UPR

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Rapid UPR activation by E2-ERα suggested accumulation of unfolded protein was not
triggering UPR activation. Some UPR activators, such as thapsigargin, rapidly activate the
UPR by depleting Ca2+ stores in the lumen of the EnR, increasing intracellular Ca2+. To test
whether E2 rapidly alters cytosol Ca2+, we monitored cytosol calcium using the sensor dye
Fluo-4 AM. In the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, estrogen produced a rapid and
transient increase in fluorescence in T47D breast cancer cells (Figure 3a and b). Since E2
increases cytosol Ca2+ when there is no extracellular Ca2+, and the EnR lumen is the major
Ca2+ store available to increase cytosol Ca2+, E2 is acting by depleting the EnR Ca2+ store.
Estrogen also increased cytosol calcium in PEO4 ovarian cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure 3). Inhibition of the IP3R channel with 2-APB, which locks the IP3R Ca2+ channels
closed, and RNAi knockdown of the three isoforms of the IP3R channels (Figure 3c),
abolished the rapid E2-ERα-mediated increase in cytosol Ca2+ (Figure 3a, b, and d). In
contrast, high concentration ryanodine (Ry), which closes the ryanodine receptor (RyR)
Ca2+ channels, did not block the increase in cytosol Ca2+ (Figure 3a and b). We next
assessed whether Ca2+ release was necessary for UPR activation using 2-APB and
ryanodine individually, or in combination. 2-APB, but not ryanodine, inhibited E2-ERα
activation of the PERK arm of the UPR, as shown by inhibition of formation of p-eIF2α
(Supplementary Figure 4a). RNAi knockdown of IP3R (Figure 3c) blocked E2-induced Ca2+
release (Figure 3d), activation of the IRE1α arm of the UPR (Supplementary Figure 4b), and
blocked E2-induction of BiP (Figure 3c), which is a commonly used surrogate readout for
UPR activation.
We next tested the possibility that activation of PLCγ, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to DAG and
IP3, plays a role in E2-mediated opening of the IP3R Ca2+ channels. Treating T47D cells
with the PLCγ inhibitor, U73122, or siRNA knockdown of PLCγ, abolished the rapid E2ERα-mediated increase in cytosol Ca2+ (Figure 3e and f; Supplementary Figure 5). Since
PLCγ mediates E2-dependent opening of the IP3R Ca2+ channels and calcium release
(Figure 3f), we examined the effect of siRNA knockdown of PLCγ on E2-ERα-dependent
activation of the UPR. siRNA knockdown of PLCγ blocked E2-ERα activation of the
ATF6α arm of the UPR, as shown by a reduction in p50-ATF6α, and inhibition of BiP
induction (Figure 3e).

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the role of ERα in the E2-mediated increase in cytosol calcium, we performed
siRNA knockdown. In T47D cells, RNAi knockdown of ERα, in the absence of
extracellular Ca2+, prevented E2-stimulated calcium release (Figure 3g and h;
Supplementary Movie 1 and 2). PLCγ is on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and
the E2-ERα-mediated increase in cytosol Ca2+ occurs in <2 min. Thus, the E2-ERαmediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ that leads to UPR activation is a rapid, extranuclear
action of ERα at the plasma membrane.

The UPR and E2-ERα Action in E2-ERα Stimulated Cell Proliferation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We explored the role of Ca2+ release from the EnR in promoting E2-ERα induced gene
expression, UPR activation, and subsequent cell proliferation. Consistent with a possible
role for intracellular Ca2+ in E2-ERα action,23 chelating intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTAAM blocked E2-stimulated cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure 6a). In T47D cells,
PLCγ or IP3R knockdown, or locking IP3R with 2-APB, strongly inhibited the increase in
cytosol Ca2+ (Figure 3a, b, d, and f), UPR activation (Figure 3c and e; Supplementary
Figure 4), and E2-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation (Figure 4a and b). However, IP3R
knockdown did not inhibit E2-dependent down-regulation of ERα or E2-induction of
GREB1 or pS2 mRNA (Figure 4c; Supplementary Figure 6b).24, 25 Similarly, 2-APB did not
abolish E2-ERα induced expression of stably transfected ERE-luciferase in T47D cells,
while 2-APB and Ry together, strongly inhibited reporter gene expression (Figure 4d). This
suggests there are different intracellular Ca2+ requirements for E2-ERα-mediated UPR
activation and E2-ERα-mediated gene expression. Importantly, the IP3R knockdown data
uncouples UPR activation from E2-ERα-mediated gene expression, and demonstrates that
blocking UPR activation is sufficient to inhibit estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation.
We next evaluated the role of E2-induction of EnR chaperones in E2-ERα-stimulated cell
proliferation. Knockdown of PLCγ or IP3R strongly inhibited E2-induction of BiP and E2ERα-stimulated cell proliferation (Figures 3c, 3e, and 4a). Knockdown of the primary UPR
regulator of EnR chaperones, ATF6α, also strongly inhibited E2-induction of BiP and E2ERα-stimulated cell proliferation (Figure 1e and 4a). Thus, UPR activation and subsequent
induction of EnR chaperones plays an important role in E2-ERα-stimulated cell
proliferation.

We further evaluated the effects of PLCγ, IP3R, ATF6α, XBP1, and PERK knockdown on
E2-stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 7). Knockdown of the
ATF6α and XBP1 arms of the UPR produced 40% declines in E2-stimulated in cell
proliferation, while PERK knockdown produced a 20% decline (Figure 4e). IP3R
knockdown produced a 50% decline in E2-ERα-stimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation (Figure
4e). This is consistent with the 40% decline in proliferation following 2-APB treatment
(Supplementary Figure 6c), which did not fully abolish E2-induction of pS2 and GREB1
mRNA (Figure 4f; Supplementary Figure 6d). Targeting IP3R in MCF-7 cells produced less
dramatic inhibition of E2-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation compared to T47D cells or BG-1
ovarian cancer cells (Figure 4a, b, and e; Supplementary Figure 6c and e). Knockdown of
PLCγ in MCF-7 cells nearly abolished E2-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation (Figure 4e).
Together, this data demonstrates that weak anticipatory activation of the UPR, resulting in
induction of chaperones, plays an important role in E2-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation.
This novel E2-ERα pathway leading to cancer cell proliferation is shown (Figure 4g).
E2-ERα Action Increases Levels of UPR Sensors and Downstream Targets
We investigated whether E2-ERα facilitates UPR activation by inducing the sensors that
trigger activation of the three UPR arms. E2 rapidly induced mRNAs encoding sensors for
all 3 UPR arms and the chaperones BiP and GRP94 (Figure 5a). These were early responses,
usually visible within 2 hours. Although some responses declined at later times, estrogen

produced sustained increases in resident chaperones and some UPR components, such as
eIF2α (Figure 5a).
E2-ERα-regulated Gene Expression and UPR Activation are Correlated In Vivo

Author Manuscript

To assess in vivo relevance, we used growing MCF-7 tumors receiving estrogen and
regressing MCF-7 tumors receiving only cholesterol vehicle (Figure 5b) and compared
expression of classical measures of E2-ERα activity to markers of UPR activation.26 In the
+E2 tumors, the markers for E2-ERα activity, pS2 and GREB1 mRNAs,24, 25 were induced
12-fold and 17-fold and all three UPR arms were moderately activated (Figure 5c and d).
Consistent with activation of the IRE1α arm of the UPR, sp-XBP1 increased 3-fold, while
total XBP1 declined (Figure 5d). Consistent with E2-activation of the ATF6α arm of the
UPR, +E2 tumors displayed 2.0 and 1.8-fold increases in BiP and GRP94 mRNAs,
respectively (Figure 5d). Levels of CHOP and GADD34 mRNA were 2.1-fold and 1.4-fold
higher in the +E2 group, respectively, indicating weak activation of the PERK arm (Figure
5d). While levels of primary UPR sensors IRE1α and PERK were reduced in these
tamoxifen-sensitive tumors, their immediate targets eIF2α and sp-XBP1 were increased
(Figure 5d).

Author Manuscript

To assess UPR activity early in ERα+ breast cancer development, we compared E2-ERα
activity and UPR pathway activity in samples of histologically normal breast epithelium and
invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Compared to normal epithelium from IDC patients, IDC
samples displayed elevated levels of ERα mRNA and E2-ERα induced pS2 and GREB1
mRNAs, and reduced levels of E2-ERα downregulated IL1-R1 mRNA (Figure 5e). IDC
samples displayed elevated SERP1 mRNA, a marker for IRE1α activation;19 CHOP and
GADD34, which are markers of PERK activation; and BiP and GRP94 chaperones, which
are markers of ATF6α activation (Figure 5f). These data suggest UPR activation occurs very
early in tumor development.
Using data from an independent cohort of 278 ERα+ breast cancers we explored whether
expression of ERα mRNA and protein, or E2-ERα-regulated genes, correlates with
expression of UPR genes. Expression of several UPR genes displayed highly significant
correlation with expression of ERα and ERα-target genes (Supplementary Table 1).
Prior Estrogen Activation of the UPR Protect Cells from Subsequent Exposure to Cell
Stress

Author Manuscript

Weakly activating, non-toxic, concentrations of the UPR activator, tunicamcyin (TUN),
elicit an adaptive stress response that increases EnR chaperones, and renders cells resistant
to subsequent exposure to an otherwise lethal concentration of tunicamycin.27, 22 Consistent
with weak E2 activation of the UPR, E2 induces a 2.3-fold increase in BiP protein compared
to a 5.5-fold increase in BiP following maximal UPR activation by a lethal concentration of
tunicamycin (Figure 1g and Supplementary Figure 8). We tested whether prior exposure of
T47D cells to E2, or a low concentration of tunicamycin, altered the concentration of
tunicamycin required to subsequently induce substantial cell death. Pre-treating cells with
estrogen or TUN had nearly identical effects; each elicited an ~10 fold increase in the
concentration of tunicamycin required to induce apoptosis (Figure 6a). Thus, the E2-induced

weak anticipatory activation of the UPR both facilitates tumor cell proliferation and is a
potential mechanism by which estrogen might protect ERα+ breast tumors against
subsequent apoptosis due to hypoxia, nutritional deprivation and therapy.
A UPR Gene Signature Predicts Clinical Outcome in ERαPositive Breast Cancer

Author Manuscript

To explore UPR activation as a potential prognostic marker in ERα+ breast cancer, we
developed a UPR gene signature consisting of genes encoding components of the UPR
pathway and downstream targets of UPR activation (Supplementary Table 2). Using data
from 261 ERα+ breast cancer patients, each assigned to a high- or low-genomic UPR grade,
we observed reduced time to relapse for patients overexpressing the UPR signature (hazard
ratio (HR) = 5.5, 95% CI: 3.1–9.8) (Supplementary Figures 9a and b). To evaluate the UPR
signature in patients undergoing tamoxifen therapy, samples collected from 474 ERα+ breast
cancer patients, prior to starting 5-years of tamoxifen therapy, were assigned to low,
medium, or high UPR risk groups. Increased prior expression of the UPR gene signature
was tightly correlated with subsequent reduced time to recurrence (Figure 6b and d;
Supplementary Figure 9c). Hazard ratios increased from 2.2 to 3.7 for the medium and highrisk groups, respectively, suggesting that recurrence risk is sensitive to levels of the UPR
gene signature (Figure 6b). The UPR index provides prognostic information beyond current
clinical covariates. In a cohort of 236 ERα+ breast cancer patients, UPR overexpression was
strongly predictive of reduced survival (HR 2.69, 95% CI: 1.3–5.6), over and above clinical
covariates alone (tumor grade, node involvement, tumor size and ERα status) (Figures 6c
and d; Supplementary Figure 9d). Thus, the UPR index is a powerful prognostic gene
signature in ERα+ breast cancer with predictive power to stratify patients into high and low
risk groups.

DISCUSSION
In contrast to the well-studied “reactive mode” of UPR activation that occurs in response to
endoplasmic reticulum stress, there are few studies of UPR activation that anticipates the
future need for increased capacity to fold and sort proteins, and occurs in the absence of
endoplasmic reticulum stress.7 Anticipatory UPR activation is observed in B-cell
differentiation where UPR activation in plasma cells precedes the massive production and
secretion of immunoglobulins.13, 14 Because the signals responsible for anticipatory
activation of the UPR are largely unknown, it is poorly understood.

Author Manuscript

In the absence of cell stress or misfolded proteins, the mitogen, estrogen, acting via ERα,
triggers anticipatory activation of the UPR in breast and ovarian cancer cells. In less than 2
minutes, E2-ERα triggers PLCγ-mediated opening of EnR IP3R calcium channels and
release of Ca2+ into the cytosol. This increase in cytosol Ca2+ stimulates activation of all
three arms of the UPR and is required for E2-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation.
Anticipatory activation of the UPR by E2-ERα enhances EnR protein folding capacity, and
thereby primes cells to meet the higher protein folding and sorting demands that characterize
the later growth phases of the cell cycle. The major EnR chaperone BiP, plays a central role
in EnR homeostasis, protein processing, and UPR signaling. Since BiP knockdown
stimulates UPR activation and promotes EnR stress-induced apoptosis,10, 28 and cells

undergoing E2-mediated apoptosis have lower levels of chaperones,29 we assessed the
consequences of abrogating the expansion of EnR protein-folding capacity by blocking
anticipatory activation of the UPR. PLCγ, IP3R or ATF6α knockdown blocked E2-induction
of BiP and inhibited E2-ERα stimulated proliferation of T47D cells. While IP3R knockdown
nearly abolished E2-ERα-stimulated Ca2+ release from the EnR, and this blocked UPR
activation, it did not inhibit E2-ERα-mediated gene expression. Thus, inhibition of E2-ERαstimulated UPR activation and chaperone induction is sufficient to inhibit E2-ERαstimulated cell proliferation. Using 2-APB and ryanodine together, or chelating intracellular
calcium with BAPTA, completely abrogated the increase in intracellular calcium, and
blocked E2-ERα-regulated gene expression. Based on the inhibitor and knockdown data, we
hypothesize that very small increases in intracellular calcium are sufficient to enable E2ERα-regulated gene expression and that somewhat larger increases in intracellular calcium
are likely required for E2-ERα activation of the UPR. E2-ERα induces a substantial increase
in intracellular calcium, which may promote coordination between the nucleus and
endoplasmic reticulum, and couple activation of the E2-ERα genomic program with UPR
activation and expansion of the EnR protein-folding capacity.

Author Manuscript

We further validated the importance of this novel extranuclear pathway of E2-ERα action
using MCF-7 cells to assess how knockdown of each pathway component affects E2-ERαstimulated cell proliferation. PERK knockdown produced a 20% decline in E2-ERαstimulated cell proliferation. Although seemingly detrimental to promoting cell proliferation,
PERK activation may be required to fully activate the ATF6α arm of the UPR.30
Knockdown of XBP1 or ATF6α produced a 40% decline in E2-ERα-stimulated cell
proliferation. IP3R knockdown produced an even larger reduction in E2-ERα stimulated cell
proliferation, while PLCγ knockdown had the largest effect. Thus, anticipatory activation of
the UPR plays an important role in E2-ERα dependent proliferation of cancer cells.
As expected,1, 3 IDC tumor samples exhibited increased ERα expression and activation
compared to normal breast epithelial tissue. Consistent with a role for the UPR in this
proliferative phase of early tumor development, increased UPR expression and activation
was observed in IDC tumor samples. This suggests that increased UPR expression occurs
early in tumor development, long before detection, diagnosis, and the initiation of treatment.

Author Manuscript

Activation of the UPR by E2-ERα exerts a long-term impact on the pathology of ERα
positive breast cancer. Weak activation of the UPR by estrogen, or by tunicamcyin, elicits an
adaptive response that protects cells from subsequent exposure to higher levels of cell stress.
We explored whether the effects of E2-ERα on the UPR correlated with clinical resistance to
tamoxifen therapy. Increased UPR activation and elevated expression of UPR components
were predictive of a poor response to tamoxifen-therapy, shorter time to recurrence, and
decreased overall survival. If UPR expression promotes resistance to tamoxifen therapy,
some UPR genes should exhibit differential regulation in our tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7
tumors,26 compared to their expression in the tamoxifen-resistance gene signature.
Supporting this view, several genes encoding UPR components were E2-downregulated in
tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 tumors, but elevated in the human tumors expressing the
tamoxifen-resistance gene signature (PERK, p58IPK).

For ERα+ breast cancers resistant to endocrine therapies, an important objective is
development of more specific biomarkers that predict therapeutic response and identification
of new therapeutic targets. The UPR is a new biomarker and therapeutic target in ERα+
breast cancer; validated through mechanistic studies in culture, a mouse xenograft, and
bioinformatics analysis of patient tumor samples. Anticipatory estrogen activation of the
UPR is a novel extranuclear action of ERα, a previously undescribed early component of the
estrogen-ERα cell proliferation program and a new paradigm by which estrogens may
influence tumor development and resistance to therapy.

in buffer (140 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.13 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM Glucose,
pH = 7.4) for 30 minutes at 37° C. The cells were washed three times with buffer and
incubated with either 2 mM or 0 mM CaCl2 for 10 minutes. Images were captured for one
minute to determine basal fluorescence intensity, and then the appropriate treatment was
added. Measurements used a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with a Plan-Four 20X
objective (N.A. = 0.8) and 488-nM laser excitation (7% power). Images were obtained
through monitoring fluorescence emission at 525 nM, and analyzed with AxioVision and
Zen software (Zeiss).

Luciferase Assays, qRT-PCR, and siRNA Transfections

Author Manuscript

Reporter gene assays and qRT-PCR were previously described.31, 32 siRNA knockdowns
were performed using DharmaFECT1 Transfection Reagent and 100 nM ON-TARGETplus
non-targeting pool or SMARTpools for ERα (ESR1), PLCγ (PLCG1), PERK (EIF2AK3),
ATF6α (ATF6), XBP1, or pan-IP3R (Dharmacon). The pan-IP3R SmartPool consisted of
three individual SmartPools, each at 33 nM, directed against each isoform of the IP3R
(ITPR1, ITPR2, and ITPR3).
MCF-7 Xenograft

Author Manuscript

Experiment were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee (IACUC) of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The MCF-7 cell mouse xenograft model has
been described previously.26 Estrogen pellets (1 mg:19 mg estrogen:cholesterol) were
implanted into 30 athymic female OVX mice at 7 weeks of age. Three days later, 1 million
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells suspended in matrigel were subcutaneously injected into
two sites on each flank, for a total of 4 tumors per mouse. When average tumor size reached
17.6 mm2, E2 pellets were removed and a lower dose of E2 in sealed silastic tubing (1:31
estrogen:cholesterol, 3 mg total weight) was implanted. When average tumor size reached
23.5 mm2, 15 mice retained E2 silastic tubes (+E2 group) and 15 mice received silastic tubes
containing only cholesterol (−E2 group). Tumors were measured every 4 days with a caliper.
Tumor cross sectional area was calculated as (a/2)*(b/2)*3.14, where a and b were the
measured diameters of each tumor. Upon termination of the experiments, mice were
euthanized and tumors were excised.
Tumor Microarray Data Analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Analysis was performed using publically available tumors cohorts. ERα and UPR gene
expression profiles of histologically normal breast epithelium (GSE20437)36 were compared
to IDC tumors from ERα+ breast cancer patients (GSE20194). ERα and UPR correlation
analysis was performed on 278 invasive ductal carcinoma samples (GSE20194).37 A “UPR
Gene Signature” was constructed to carry out risk prediction analysis. The UPR gene
signature was evaluated for its ability to predict: (i) tumor relapse in 261 early-stage ERα+
breast cancers (GSE6532),37 (ii) tumor relapse in 474 ERα+ patients receiving solely
tamoxifen therapy for 5 years (GSE6532, GSE17705),38, 39 and (iii) overall survival in a
mixed-cohort of 236 breast cancer patients (GSE3494).40 Microarray data analysis was
performed using BRB ArrayTools (version 4.2.1) and R software version 2.13.2. Gene
expression values from CEL files were normalized by use of the standard quantile
normalization method.41 Pearson correlation tests and Spearman log rank tests were used to
determine gene expression correlation coefficients. Wald tests were used to test whether
UPR genes were predictive of tumor recurrence and overall survival. Univariate and
multivariate hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression analysis. Covariates
statistically significant in univariate analysis were further assessed in multivariate analysis.
A patient was excluded from multivariate analysis, if data for one or more variables was
missing. Risk prediction using the UPR gene signature was carried out using the supervised
principle components method,42 and visualized using Kaplan-Meier plots and compared
using log-rank tests.

group (n = 15), while silastic tubes were retained in the +E2 treatment group (n = 15). qRTPCR analysis of (c) classical E2-ERα regulated genes and (d) the UPR in mouse tumors
collected after 24 days of exposure to estrogen (+E2) or vehicle-control (−E2) (n = 15).
Relative mRNA levels of (e) classical E2-ERα regulated genes and (f) the UPR pathway in
patient samples of normal breast epithelium taken from patients undergoing reduction
mammoplasty (RM) (n = 18), histologically normal breast epithelium taken from patients
diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (n = 9), and carcinoma epithelium taken
from IDC patients (n = 20). p-values represent comparisons to –E2 groups (a, c, d) or to
histologically normal breast epithelium from patients who underwent reduction
mammoplasty (e, f). Data is mean ± SEM. * P <0.05; ** P <0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns, not
significant.

Anticipatory activation of the UPR by estrogen protects cells from subsequent cell stress,
and expression of the UPR gene signature predicts relapse-free and overall survival in ERα
positive breast tumor cohorts. (a) Weak anticipatory activation of the UPR with estrogen or
tunicamycin protects cells from subsequent UPR stress. T47D cells were maintained in 10%
CD-FBS for 8 days and treated with either 250 ng/ml tunicamycin (TUN), 100 pM E2, or
ethanol/DMSO-vehicle (Untreated). E2, TUN, or the vehicle control were removed from
medium, and cells were harvested in 10% CD-calf serum and treated with the indicated
concentrations of tunicamycin. Data is mean ± SEM (n = 6). Different letters indicate a
significant difference among groups (p < 0.05) using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s
LSD post hoc test. (b) Relapse-free survival as a function of the UPR gene signature for
patients with ERα+ breast cancer who subsequently received tamoxifen alone for 5 years.
Interquartile range used to assign tumors to risk groups, representing UPR activity from high
to low. Hazard ratios are between low and medium and low and high UPR groups (n = 474).
(c) Overall survival as a function of the UPR signature and clinical covariates (node status,
tumor grade, ERα-status, tumor size). p-value is testing for significance between the
combined model (UPR gene signature and clinical covariates) versus the covariates only
model (multivariate analysis) (n = 236). (d) Univariate and multivariate Cox regression
analysis of the UPR signature, clinical covariates, and classical estrogen-induced genes for
time to recurrence and survival (n.s., not significant). Median used to classify tumors into
high and low risk groups.
