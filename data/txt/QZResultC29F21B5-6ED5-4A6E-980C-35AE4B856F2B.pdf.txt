Abstract
ZD6474, a small molecule VEGFR and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been
considered as a promising tumor-targeted drug in various malignancies. EGFR and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were found overexpressed in osteosarcoma in previous
reports, so here we tried to explore the anti-osteosarcoma effect of ZD6474 alone
or combination with celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor. The data demonstrated that
ZD6474 inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma cells, and promoted G1-phase cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase, and
consequently suppressing its downstream PI3k/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathway.
Additionally, daily administration of ZD6474 produced a dose-dependent inhibition
of tumor growth in nude mice. Celecoxib also significantly inhibited the growth of
osteosarcoma cells in dose-dependent manner, while combination of ZD6474 and
celecoxib displayed a synergistic or additive antitumor effect on osteosarcoma in vitro
and in vivo. The possible molecular mechanisms to address the synergism are likely
that ZD6474 induces the down-regulation of COX-2 expression through inhibiting
ERK phosphorylation, while celecoxib promotes ZD6474-directed inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation. In conclusion, ZD6474 exerts direct anti-proliferative effects on
osteosarcoma cells, and the synergistic antitumor effect of the combination of ZD6474
with celecoxib may indicate a new strategy of the combinative treatment of human
osteosarcoma.

INTRODUCTION

multiple signaling pathways and microRNAs [2-5].
Although aggressive surgery, intensive radiotherapy and
chemotherapy regimens (with agents such as doxorubicin,
methotrexate, cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide) have
been utilized, the clinical outcome for osteosarcoma
remains discouraging [6-8]. Moreover, traditional

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary
malignant bone tumor in children and young adults [1, 2],
which has been found to harbor a highly unstable genome
and several important genomic alteration including

chemotherapy always leads to the enrichment or induction
of osteosarcoma stem cells [9] and consenquently resulted
in treatment resistance. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches
targeting important pathways are urgently needed to
improve the treatment of osteosarcoma [7, 10, 11].
Various overexpressed cell surface transmembrane
receptors, such as ErbB2, EGFR, IGF-1R, PDGFR and
VEGFR, activate diverse signaling cascades that have been
implicated in osteosarcoma oncogenesis [12-15]. Certain
targeted small molecule inhibitors have been expected to
lead an efficient treatment in osteosarcoma [16]. However,
gefitinib and BIBW2992, two EGFR inhibitors, were
reported not effective against osteosarcoma cells in a
recent report, though osteosarcoma cells do over-express
EGFR [14]. So further studies are necessary to explore the
potential of other therapeutic agents targeting EGFR [14].
ZD6474 is a small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple
tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR-2 and EGFR) [17],
which can block multiple intracellular signaling pathways
involved in tumor growth, progression, and angiogenesis
in several tumors [17-19]. In this study, we firstly tried
to explore whether ZD6474 demonstrated a potential
therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of osteosarcoma.
COX-2 was also found overexpressed frequently
in osteosarcoma, which promoted malignant potential of
neoplasms [20, 21] and was associated with poor prognosis
for patients with osteosarcoma [22, 23]. Celecoxib, a

selective COX-2 inhibitor, can induce osteosarcoma
cell apoptosis via inhibiting COX-2 [24, 25], and has
been applied for the clinical trials to treat osteosarcoma
and Ewing sarcoma [26, 27]. Here, we also investigate
the anti-proliferative effect of combined treatment with
celecoxib and ZD6474 on human osteosarcoma in vitro
and the antitumor activity on osteosarcoma xenografts
in vivo, to search a potential efficient comprehensive
therapeutics for osteosarcoma.

RESULTS
ZD6474 inhibits the proliferation of human
osteosarcoma cells
The anti-proliferation effect of ZD6474 on
osteosarcoma cells was measured by MTT assay and clone
formation assay. The data demonstrated that ZD6474
efficiently inhibited the proliferation of osteosarcoma
cells (Figure 1A), and the half maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of ZD6474 in MG-63, MNNG/
HOS CL#5, and U2OS cells were 22.26±3.82, 26.55±5.20
and 21.85±3.65 μM, respectively, after treated for 72
hours (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, the clone formation of
3 osteosarcoma cells was all significantly inhibited by

To further dissect the G1-S cell cycle arrest induced
by ZD6474, MG-63 cells were re-entered into the cell
cycle by addition of serum, and cell cycle progression
was monitored in the presence or absence of ZD6474
after synchronized in G0/G1 phase by serum starvation
overnight. The results showed that untreated cells rapidly
exited G0/G1 phase and went through S phase, oppositely
ZD6474-treated cells showed an accumulating during G0/
G1 phase (Figure 2C). That is to say, cells during G0/G1
phase gradually increased in ZD6474-treated group while
decreased in control group after serum recovery (12 hours,
71.44% verse 58.14%; 24 hours, 82.09% vserse 55.45%).
These data suggested that ZD6474 induced G1/S phase
cell cycle arrest in human osteosarcoma cells.

ZD6474 (Figure 1C and 1D) (p < 0.01). In summary,
ZD6474 inhibited the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells
in a dose-dependent manner.

ZD6474 induces cell cycle arrest in human
osteosarcoma cells
To examine whether the antiproliferative effect of
ZD6474 on osteosarcoma cell lines was mediated via
specific cell cycle arrest, we investigated the cell cycle
phase distribution by flow cytometric analysis after
ZD6474 treatment. We found that there was an obvious
accumulation of cells during G0/G1 phase in MG-63,
MNNG/HOS CL#5, and U2OS cells treated with 16 μM
of ZD6474 for 24 hours (Figure 2A). Next, we incubated
U2OS cells with ZD6474 at gradient concentrations, and
found that the percentages of cells during G0/G1 phase
were increased with increasing concentration of ZD6474
within a certain range (Figure 2B). Moreover, the G1phase cell cycle arrest induced by ZD6474 was also timedependent in U2OS cells (data not shown).

of ZD6474 on cell apoptosis. The data showed that the
percentage of early apoptotic cells (Annexin-V-positive)
increased in osteosarcoma cells treated with ZD6474
compared with the control group (p < 0.05) (Figure 3).
The percentages of early apoptotic cells in U2OS cells
treated with 5 μM, 10 μM or 20 μM of ZD6474 were
37.9±1.1%, 46.4±1.1% and 51.4±1.8%, respectively, while
that of the control group was only 5.9 ± 1.2% (Figure 3).
Similar results were observed in MG-63 and MNNG/HOS
CL#5 cells (p < 0.05). These data suggested that ZD6474
promoted apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells in a
dose-dependent manner.

HOS CL#5 cells though total Akt and ERK proteins
had no obvious changes (Figure 4B). These findings
suggested that ZD6474 inhibited the phosphorylation of
key signaling molecules (such as Akt, ERK) by blocking
EGFR tyrokinase activity, and restrained the activation of
two major downstream signal pathways, PI3K/Akt and
MAPK/ERK.

ZD6474 inhibits the activation of EGFR pathway

We measured COX-2 expression at the protein level
in osteosarcoma cells and high level of COX-2 protein
was found in MG-63 and MNNG/HOS CL#5 cells while
lower expression in U2OS (Figure 5A). And COX-2
expression could be inhibited by celecoxib treatment
within 24 hours in MNNG/HOS CL#5 cells (Figure 5E).
MTT assay revealed that the proliferation of osteosarcoma
MG-63, MNNG/HOS CL#5 and U2OS cells was inhibited
by celecoxib treatment in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 5B), and IC50 values of celecoxib for 72 hours of
incubation were 80.5±7.9, 69.1±13.5 and 64.3±8.6 μM,
respectively (Figure 5C).

To explore the mechanisms by which ZD6474
inhibits the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells, EGFR
expression was firstly evaluated at the protein level, and
visible bands of EGFR protein was detected in all of
osteosarcoma cells, and these is a high EGFR expression
in MG-63 and MNNG/HOS CL#5 cells compared with
that in U2OS cells (Figure 4A). After ZD6474 treatment
for 2 hours, the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK
decreased significantly in U2OS, MG-63 and MNNG/

Considering that multi-target therapy always
show stronger antitumor effect than single-target one,
we examined the antiproliferation activity of ZD6474
combined with celecoxib, and found that combination
treatment with ZD6474 (10 µM) and celecoxib (40 µM)
displayed a significantly higher activity than treatment
with ZD6474 or celecoxib alone (p < 0.05 or 0.01) (Figure
5D), and combined treatment showed additive effects in
MG-63 and MNNG/HOS CL#5 cells (Q = 1.120 and
1.076) or synergistic effect in U2OS cells (Q = 1.268).
To clarify the possible mechanisms to address
the synergistic or additive effect between ZD6474 and
celecoxib, we checked COX-2, p-ERK levels after treated
cells with ZD6474 or/and celecoxib. The results showed
that not only celecoxib but ZD6474 down-regulated COX2 expression, meanwhile celecoxib promoted the inhibition

of ERK phosphorylation directed by ZD6474 though
celecoxib alone had no obvious effect (Figure 5E). To
make clear how ZD6474 caused COX-2 down-regulation,
we checked the effect of ERK inhibitor (PD98059) on
COX-2 expression, and found that the protein level of
COX-2 was down-regulated in MNNG/HOS CL#5 cells
and MG-63 cells after PD98059 treatment (Figure 5F). So
we assume that ZD6474 and celecoxib likely produce an
additive or synergistic anti-tumor effect on osteosarcoma
via ZD6474-mediated the downregulation of COX2 expression and celecoxib-directed the enhancement
of ERK phosphorylation inhibition. Meanwhile, the
inhibitory effect of ZD6474 on COX-2 expression is likely
functioned via inhibiting MAPK/ERK pathway.

mg/kg/day) combined with celecoxib (150mg/kg/day)
displayed more antitumor effects compared with ZD6474
or celecoxib alone (p < 0.01) (Figure 6C). The inhibition
rates were 81.1% (combination group) vs. 59.5% (ZD6474

(Figure 6D). The combined treatment showed a synergistic
antitumor effect (Q = 1.156). There were not obvious
effects on the body weight of mice in animal studies
described above (data not shown), indicating that singleagent ZD6474 and ZD6474 combined with celecoxib are
likely well-tolerated.
After treated for 22 days, xenografts were resected
(Figure 6E) and cell apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL
assay. There were obvious cell apoptosis (cells with green
fluorescence indicating apoptotic cells) found in all tumor

Consequently, we investigated antitumor effect of
treatment with ZD6474 and/or celecoxib in nude mice
suffering MNNG/HOS CL#5 osteosarcoma xenografts.
The results showed that the growth of tumors in the groups
treated with ZD6474 was significantly slower than that in
the control group (p < 0.01) (Figure 6A). Once-daily oral
administration of ZD6474 produced a significant dosedependent inhibition effect. Inhibition rates were 59.5%
and 39.8% in the groups treated with ZD6474 100 or 50
mg/kg/day respectively (p < 0.01) (Figure 6B). Celecoxib
(150mg/kg/day) alone also significantly inhibited the

suppresses a number of tumors, including non-small cell
lung cancer as well as breast, gastric, prostate, colorectal,
nasopharyngeal cancers and leukemia, through inhibiting
tumor cell growth and survival [31-34].
The expression of EGFR was detected in the vast
majority of osteosarcoma [14]. We also found that EGFR
was expressed in all of three osteosarcoma cell lines used
in this study, though the EGFR protein level in U2OS cells
was markedly lower than in other two cell lines. Although
gefitinib and BIBW2992, two EGFR inhibitors, were
reported not effective against osteosarcoma cells [14],
we found in this study that ZD6474 exerts a direct antiosteosarcoma effect in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
1 and Figure 6). Inhibiting the activity of EGFR tyrosine
kinase and consequently retarding its downstream PI3k/
Akt and MAPK/ERK pathway (Figure 4; [31]) is likely
main molecular mechanism how ZD6474 functions as
an effective anti-osteosarcoma drug. These findings will
partially account for the reasons that ZD6474 induces
G1-S phase arrest and cell apoptosis, in turn, inhibits the
proliferation and growth of osteosarcoma cells/xenografts.
The inhibitory effects of ZD6474 on osteosarcoma cells in
vitro are not related with the EGFR levels (Figure 1 and
Figure 4A) furtherly suggests that ZD6474 is a multipletarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and plays anti-pliferation
role also via inhibiting other signal pathways.

DISCUSSION
Growth-inducing signaling is needed for cells to
move from a quiescent state into an active proliferative
state. Growth factor receptors overexpressed in many
cancers carry tyrosine kinase activity in their cytoplasmic
domains and transduce stimulatory growth signals into the
cell interior. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases blocks multiple
intracellular signaling pathways involved in tumor
growth, progression, and angiogenesis [28]. Osteosarcoma
expresses cell surface transmembrane receptors that
share common features of transmembrane receptors
with tyrosine kinase activity, and these receptors activate
different intracellular signaling cascades that have been
implicated in oncogenesis [29, 30]. ZD6474 is a novel
VEGFR-2, EGFR and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which

COX-2 is an enzyme responsible for formation
of important biological mediators called prostanoids,
including prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane.
Increasing evidence supports the role of COX-2 in
promoting tumor cell growth, survival and angiogenesis
through the activity of COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) [35]. PGE2 stimulates prostaglandin E2 receptor
to activate MAPK/ERK (also known as the Ras-RafMEK-ERK) and PI3K/Akt pathways, and activates
multiple transcription factors, such as AP-1 and CREB,
which promote the expression of Cyclin D1, VEGF,
AREG, Bcl-2, etc., and result in tumor cell proliferation,
survival, antiapoptosis and angiogenesis ([36-39]; Figure
7). So COX-2 is considered as a promising therapeutic
target for multiple malignancies [35].
High levels of COX-2 expression have been
observed in osteosarcoma tissues [20, 21] and was
associated with poor prognosis for osteosarcoma patients
[22, 23]. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib, have
been reported to inhibit osteosarcoma growth in previous
reports [25, 40] and in our study (Figure 5 and Figure
6). Strangely, U2OS cells with low COX-2 expression
display similar sensitivity to celecoxib with other two
osteosarcoma cells (MNNG/HOS CL#5 and MG-63)
which highly express COX-2 in vitro (Figure 5A-5C). It
needs more detailed experiments to clarify and explain this
phenomenon.
There is now an increasing number of preclinical
evidence showing that simultaneous targeting multiple
pathways improves the treatment of cancer. In this paper,
we also found that the combinative treatment with COX-2
inhibitor celecoxib and EGFR inhibitor ZD6474 presented
a synergistic/additive antitumor effect on osteosarcoma in
vivo and in vitro (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Celecoxib was
reported to inhibit PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways
via targeting COX-2 [25, 36, 39], and we found that
celecoxib also promoted ZD6474-directed inhibition of
MAPK/ERK pathway (Figure 5E). Meanwhile, not only
celecoxib but ZD6474 inhibited COX-2 expression via
suppressing MAPK/ERK pathway (Figure 5E), which
had also been confirmed by the downregulation of COX-2
expression resulted from ERK inhibitor PD98059 (Figure
5F) and upregulation of COX-2 expression induced by
epidermal growth factor [41]. These findings may provide
a reasonable explanation for the synergism of ZD6474 and
celecoxib on anti-osteosarcoma activity.
ZD6474 is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
so it likely exerted the anti-osteosarcoma effect also
through antiangiogenesis or other growth signal pathway
[19]. Similarly, celecoxib may play additional antitumor
role in osteosarcoma by suppressing angiogenesis
and inflammatory response in animal model. These
assumptions, supported partially by the report that
celecoxib inhibits VEGF expression via suppressing the
COX-2/PGE2 pathway [36, 39], need to be confirmed in
further study.

In summary, ZD6474 exerts direct antitumor effects
on osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in xenograft nude
mouse model through inhibiting the activation of EGFR
pathway and consequently suppressing downstream PI3k/
Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, and the combination
of ZD6474 with celecoxib demonstrated a synergistic/
additive antitumor effect by the interaction and regulation
of EGFR and COX-2/PGE2 pathway (a schematic
diagram was shown in Figure 7). These findings shed light
on the molecular basis of tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone
or in combination with COX-2 inhibitors and a possible
new strategy for comprehensive treatment of human
osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
ZD6474 was synthesized according to a patent
(number: wo2,003,039,551) procedure [31-33]. Celecoxib

well, allowed to recover for 24 hours and then treated using
complete media alone or containing ZD6474 or celecoxib
at different concentrations for 72 hours. Afterwards, 20 μl
of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added into each well and
incubated for 4 hours After removing the medium, 150 µl
of DMSO were added per well to dissolve the formazan
crystal, and the absorbance was recorded at a 490 nm
wavelength using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
reader (Molecular Device Inc, Silicon Valley, CA). The
data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software to
obtain the IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration).
For the clone formation assay, cells were seeded in
6-well plates at a density of 500 cells per well, recovered
for 24 hours and then treated with ZD6474 at different
concentrations. The cells were grown for 10-14 days till
there was visible clonal colony formation. The colonies
were washed gently with phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
0.01 mol/L, pH 7.4) twice, and fixed and dyed with 5 ml
of 0.5% crystal violet solution for 15 min, then washed
with PBS and air-dried. Cell proliferation assays were
performed at least three times (in replicates of six wells for
each data point in each experiment). Monoclone number
was counted and data were presented as the mean and
standard deviation (SD) for a representative experiment.

Total cell lysates were prepared by extracting
proteins with RIPA lysis buffer (PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 mg/ml
aprotinin, leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. After incubation on ice for 30 min, samples were
centrifuged at 18,000 g for 15 min to remove insoluble
materials. Protein concentration in supernatant was
measured by Bradford Protein assay. Using 4–12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel, 20-40 μg of total protein was resolved
by electrophoresis and was then transferred to a PVDF
membrane. The membrane was blocked with either 5%
BSA or 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline followed
by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C
with gentle shaking. Then, blots were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
for 1 hour at room temperature and signals were enhanced
by ECL detection system and captured using X-ray film.

> 18 g) were obtained from the Guangdong experimental
animal center (Guangdong, China; license No. SYXK
(Yue) 2010-0102). Mice were housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions according to protocols approved
by the Sun Yat-sen University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. After 1-week adaptation, mice were
subcutaneously injected in the scapular region with 3×106
MNNG/HOS CL#5 cells in 100 µl of serum-free media.
When tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3, mice were
sacrificed, and the tumors were isolated. Tumors were
sheared into small patches (30 mm3) and implanted in
the scapular region. When tumors reached a volume of
80 mm3, the mice with implanted tumors were randomly
allocated into groups (n = 7 per group) that received (i.g.)
ZD6474 (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day), celecoxib (150 mg/
kg/day), ZD6474 (100 mg/kg/day) and celecoxib (150
mg/kg/day), or vehicle (sterilized water) once daily at
a dose of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. Tumor volume was
assessed every three days by caliper measurement of
tumor diameter and calculated according to the formula
V = L ×W2/2 (L, length; W, width). After 22 days of
treatment, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were resected
and weighed. All animal experiments were conducted
in accordance with the ‘‘Guidelines for the Welfare of
Animals in Experimental Neoplasia’’.

Cell cycle analysis
After ZD6474 treatment for 24 hours, cells were
harvested, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, then
fixed by resuspension in 75% ice-cold methanol/PBS and
incubated overnight at 4°C. After fixing, samples were
pelleted at 400 g for 5 min, and the pellets were washed
three times with ice-cold PBS, and then resuspended in
500 μl of PBS. After addition of 10 μl of RNase (10 mg/
ml), cells were stained with 10 μl of propidium iodide (1
mg/ml) at 37°C for 30 min in the dark. Flow cytometric
analysis was performed using a Coulter Epics Elite flow
cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, CA, USA).

Annexin-V/PI binding assay
Floating cells collected by centrifugation and
adherent cells harvested by trypsinization were both used
for Annexin-V/PI binding assay. After ZD6474 treatment
for 48 hours, cells were harvested and washed with icecold PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer, and
stained by adding 5 μl of FITC-Annexin V and 1 μl of PI
working solution and incubation at room temperature for
15 min. After diluted with 500 μl of binding buffer, stained
cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.

TUNEL assays
The tumor tissues stripped from xenograft nude
mice were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, followed
by paraffin embedding and section, and then terminal

deoxyribonucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions for the assessment of
cell apoptosis in the sections. Labeled cells were then
counted in 10 random fields of 200× magnification per
study group.

Statistical analysis
The data were evaluated using ANOVA with
SPSS16.0 software. The combined effect of the drugs was
assessed with the Q value using Zheng-Jun Jin’s method
as previously described [42-44]: Q = EAB/[EA+EB(1-EA)]
(EA, EB and EAB indicate the inhibitory rates of A, B and
the combination of the two drugs). The effect of the
combination of two drugs can be classified as antagonistic
(Q < 0.85), additive (0.85 < Q < 1.15), or synergistic
(Q>1.15).
