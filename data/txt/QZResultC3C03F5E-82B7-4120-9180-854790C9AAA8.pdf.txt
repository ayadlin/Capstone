Abstract
p38 kinases are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family that transduce signals from various environmental stresses, growth factors, and steroid hormones. p38 is
highly expressed in aggressive and invasive breast cancers. Increased levels of activated p38 are markers of poor prognosis.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of p38
signaling would inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation.
We studied breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation upon p38 blockade by using three independent
approaches: dominant-negative (DN) constructs, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and small molecule inhibitors. p38α
and p38δ are the most abundant isoforms expressed by all
examined human breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines.
Expression of a DN p38 inhibited both anchorage-dependent
and -independent proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells. Silencing
of p38α, but not p38δ, using siRNA suppressed MDA-MB-468 cell
proliferation. Pharmacologic inhibitors of p38 significantly inhibited the proliferation of p53 mutant and ER-negative breast
cancer cells. Whereas p38 has previously been considered as a
mediator of stress-induced apoptosis, we propose that p38 may
have dual activities regulating survival and proliferation depending on the expression of p53. Our data suggest that p38
mediates the proliferation signal in breast cancer cells expressing mutant but not wild-type p53. Because most ER-negative
breast tumors express mutant p53, our results provide the
foundation for future development of p38 inhibitors to target
p38 for the treatment of p53 mutant and ER-negative breast
cancers. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):8853–61]

Introduction
It is predicted that, in 2009, 192,370 women in the United States
will develop breast cancer and 40,170 women will die from the disease (1). Selective estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) reduce ER-positive breast cancer
recurrence by ∼50% (2, 3). However, these agents are not effective
in treating ER-negative breast cancer, which accounts for 30% to
40% of all breast cancers (4). The only effective targeted therapy for
ER-negative breast cancer is trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody that targets the subset of breast cancer that overexpresses HER-2 protein (5). Standard treatment for patients

with ER-negative and HER-2–negative breast cancer is chemotherapy, which is nonspecific and generally toxic. Thus, there is an
urgent need to develop more effective agents that can treat ERnegative and HER-2–negative breast cancer.
Because several different growth factor pathways can stimulate
breast cell proliferation, agents that target a single signal transduction pathway only have transient effects on the growth of breast
cancer. It may be more effective to inhibit signal transduction at
a more distal point in the cascade, where many mitogenic signals
converge. One such point of convergence is the p38 mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK).
p38s are members of the MAPK family that also includes the
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and the c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK). p38s can be activated by multiple stimuli, including various growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and
chemical/physical stresses (6). Activated p38 kinases can regulate
cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and responses to inflammation or stress (6–8). Four mammalian p38 isoforms have been identified: p38α (9, 10), p38β (11), p38γ (12–14), and p38δ (15, 16). p38
isoforms are differentially expressed, produce responses in a cell
type–specific manner, and activate selective downstream substrates (15–18).
High levels of p38 have been correlated with highly invasive and
poor prognostic breast cancers. Selective activation of p38 was
found in Grade II or III intraductal tumors (19). p38 phosphorylation occurred in ∼20% of primary breast carcinomas (20). Increased expression of phosphorylated p38 was correlated with
HER-2 amplification and tamoxifen resistance (21). Davidson and
colleagues observed significantly higher nuclear expression of
phosphorylated p38 in breast carcinoma effusions when compared
with both primary tumors and lymph node metastases, making
p38 a potential prognostic marker for patients with breast cancer
effusions (22).
The role of p38 in regulating breast cancer cell proliferation has
not been investigated. We hypothesized that blockade of p38 signaling would inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. To test this
hypothesis, we blocked p38 signaling in a panel of breast cancer
cells using three independent approaches: dominant-negative
(DN) constructs, small interfering RNAs (siRNA), and small molecule inhibitors. We found that blockade of p38 signaling significantly inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells with a
p53 mutation (p53MUT). We propose that whereas p38 may function as a regulator of survival in the context of wild-type p53
(p53WT), it is a crucial regulator of proliferation when cells express
p53MUT. These studies provide the foundation for future development of p38 inhibitors and clinical trials to target p38 signaling for
the treatment of breast cancer, especially those with p53MUT and
with a triple-negative (ER negative, PR negative, and Her2 negative)
molecular profile.

MCF-7 cells were infected with retrovirus pBabe or pBabe-Flag-DN p38 produced using Phoenix A packaging cells, according to Dr. Garry Nolan's protocol (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Puromycin resistant pools of cells
were screened for Flag-DN p38 expression. Two small molecule p38 inhibitors, SB203580 (Calbiochem) and AZ10164773 (obtained from AstraZeneca),
were used in this study. Anisomycin and DMSO were purchased from Sigma.
For anisomycin treatment, cells were cultured in serum-free improved
modified Eagle's medium (IMEM) for 24 h and then treated with DMSO or
50 ng/mL anisomycin for 15 min.
Western blot analysis. Cells lysates were prepared as described previously (23). Total protein extract (20 μg) was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). Primary anti‐
bodies specific for p38 (#9212), phosphorylated p38 (T180/Y182; #9211),
MAPKAPK-2 (#3042), JNK(#9252), phosphorylated JNK (#9251), ERK1/2

β-actin (#A-5441) were purchased from Sigma. Antimouse (#NA931V) and
antirabbit (#NA934V) secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham.
Cell proliferation assays. Cells were plated in six-well plates at 2 × 104 or
3 × 104 per well for slower growing cells. Cell proliferation was measured by
counting cells using a hemocytometer. Each data point was performed in triplicate, and results are reported as average percentage ± SD. Cell growth was
also measured using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous NonRadioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay, Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol
in the presence of SB203580 or AZ10164773. Each data point was performed
in quadruplet, and results are reported as average absorption ± SD.
Human breast tumors. Thirty-seven human breast tumor samples were
isolated from the Asterand tumor bank purchased by the Breast Center at
Baylor College of Medicine. All studies were conducted with approval from
the Institutional Review Boards at Baylor College of Medicine. Tumor tissue was flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation was
performed. Tumor tissue was disrupted by homogenization using a PRO
Scientific rotor-stator homogenizer with Multi-Gen7 generators.
RNA preparation and quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. Total
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and probe-based quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was performed as described
previously (24). Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Data were
reported as normalized copy numbers ± SD.
siRNA transfection. Pools of siRNAs for p38α and p38δ were purchased
from Dharmacon. Additional siRNAs for p38α were purchased from Sigma.

stimulation and stained with propidium iodide (23). Cell cycle distribution
for ∼10,000 cells was analyzed using a Coulter Epics-XL-MCL flow cytometer and XL System Software (Beckman Coulter).
Anchorage-independent cell growth. Cells (5 × 103) were suspended in
0.375% Seaplaque agar (FMC) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, and 0.1% gentamicin. Suspended cells were layered over 0.75% agar
base in the same medium. Microscopically visible colonies (average size, 50
cells) were counted 4 wk after plating by Giemsa staining. All experiments
were performed in triplicates. Data reported represent average colony
number per cm2 ± SD.
Statistical analyses. Analysis was performed using SAS software version
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.). Friedman χ2 test and pair-wise Wilcoxon signedrank test with Bonferroni adjustment were used to determine differences in
the abundance of p38 isoforms in the human breast tumors. P < 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant. We also used a mixed linear model
with random experiment effects to determine significance for all growth
assays.

Results
p38 expression in human breast tumors and established
breast cancer cell lines. To study p38 signaling in breast cancer,
we measured p38 mRNA expression in 37 human breast tumors
(see Materials and Methods) using Q-RT-PCR. p38α is the most
abundant of the four p38 isoforms in these human breast tumors
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). These tumors also express high levels of p38δ
but minimal expression of p38β and p38γ. We then measured p38
mRNA levels in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B).
The expression pattern of p38 isoforms in these breast cancer cell
lines is consistent with the human breast tumors, with p38α and
p38δ isoforms being the most abundant. The RNA and protein levels do not exactly correlate with each other. This may relate to
minor differences in RNA or protein stability in the cell lines or
alternatively reflects the semiquantitative nature of Western blot
analysis. Finally, we measured the total p38 level in breast cancer
cell lines using an antibody that recognizes all p38 isoforms
(Fig. 1C). The Western blot analysis showed that the p38 protein
is expressed in all the examined breast cancer cell lines.
DN p38 inhibits proliferation of MDA-MB-468 and MDAMB-231 cells but not MCF-7 cells. To further evaluate the role
of p38 in regulating breast cancer cell proliferation, we expressed
a DN form of p38 in several human breast cancer cell lines. This
DN p38 was generated by mutating Thr180 to Ala and Tyr182 to Phe.
The phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 is required for p38 kinase
activity but is not required for p38 to form complex with upstream
kinases (i.e., MKK3 and MKK6) that phosphorylate p38 (25). Stable
pools of MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells were created expressing this DN p38 (Fig. 2A and B). MAPKAPK-2 has been
previously shown to be regulated by p38, and anisomycin can
phosphorylate p38 and subsequently phosphorylate MAPKAPK-2
(26). Expression of the DN p38 is visualized as a larger Flag-tagged
p38 protein, as well as by the anti-Flag antibody. This DN p38 protein inhibited phosphorylation MAPKAPK-2 as seen by the absence
of a supershift in MAPKAPK-2 expression (Fig. 2A), indicating that
p38 signaling in the MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells
was effectively blocked. Expression of the DN p38 also significantly
inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells (P < 0.0001) and
MDA-MB-231 cells (P = 0.0007; Fig. 2B). However, the growth
of MCF-7 cells was not significantly suppressed in the presence
of the DN p38 (P = 0.1809; Fig. 2B). MDA-MB-231 cells were not
as effectively suppressed by the DN p38 as MDA-MB-468 cells, although they are both triple-negative cell lines and p53MUT. One

p38 Blockade Suppresses ER-Negative Breast Cancer

Figure 1. Expression of p38 in human breast tumors and cancer cell lines. A, mRNA levels of p38α, β, γ, and δ in 37 human breast tumors were measured by
Q-RT-PCR. Genomic equivalent copies for each p38 isoform were normalized to cyclophilin. Statistical analysis was performed using Friedman χ2 test and pair-wise
Wilcoxon signed-rank test and found that p38α is the most abundant isoform (P < 0.0001). B, mRNA levels of p38α, β, γ, and δ in a panel of human breast cancer
cells measured by Q-RT-PCR. Genomic equivalent copies for each p38 isoform were normalized to cyclophilin (n = 3). C, Total p38 protein levels in the cell lines were
measured by Western blots. The level of total p38 protein was normalized to that of β-actin (n = 3).

possible reason for this difference in sensitivity to p38 blockade
may be because MDA-MB-231 cells express an activated and mutant Ras protein, which may provide an additional growth signal
(thus making them slightly less sensitive to p38 blockade). Taken
together these data provide evidence that p38 blockade can inhibit
the proliferation of some breast cancer cells, particularly those that
are p53MUT and triple negative.

DN p38 inhibits anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells. Stable clones of MDA-MB-468 cells
expressing the DN p38 were created to study the mechanisms by
which p38 blockade induces growth suppression in breast cancer
cells. In three independent clones of MDA-MB-468/Flag-DN p38
#9, #25, and #29, expression of the DN p38 blocked serum-induced
phosphorylation of MAPKAPK-2 (Fig. 2C) but not that of JNK or

Figure 2. Expression of DN p38 inhibited MDA-MB-468 cell growth both in anchorage-dependent and -independent manner. A, stable pools were cultured in serum free
IMEM for 24 h and treated with 50 ng/mL anisomycin for 15 min. The levels of total p38, total MAPKAPK-2, Flag, and β-actin were measured by Western blot. B,
to measure growth, the stable pools of cells in A were plated in six-well plates at 2 × 104 per well. Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells (n = 3) every 24 h.
Analysis was performed using a mixed linear model, and P values were as follows for MDA-MB-468 (P < 0.0001), MDA-MB-231 (P = 0.0007), and MCF-7 cells
(P = 0.1809). C, clones of MDA-MB-468/pcDNA3 (#1, #2, and #4) and MDA-MB-468/pcDNA3-DN p38 (#9, #25, and #29) were plated and maintained in serum-free
IMEM for 48 h. Medium was then replaced with full growth medium IMEM containing 10% heat inactivated FBS. Cells were harvested at either 0 (−) or 10 min (+)
after serum stimulation. The levels of total p38, MAPKAPK-2, and β-actin were measured by Western blot. The arrow indicates the larger Flag-tagged p38 protein. D, the
above pcDNA3 clones were plated in six-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well to measure anchorage-dependent growth. Cell proliferation was measured daily by
counting cells (n = 3). Analysis was performed using a mixed linear model (P = 0.0005). The clones were also plated in soft agar in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at 5 ×
103 cells per dish. Anchorage independent growth was measured by counting colonies formed in soft agar 4 wk after plating (n = 3). Analysis was performed
using a mixed linear model (P < 0.0001).

ERK1/2 (data not shown), suggesting that the blockade is specific
for the p38 signaling pathway. These results were determined by
comparing to control pcDNA3 clones #1, #2, and #4. The anchoragedependent growth of MDA-MB-468/Flag-DN p38 cells was significantly repressed when compared with that of MDA-MB-468
transfected with only the empty vector (P = 0.0005; Fig. 2D).
The expression of DN p38 also significantly suppressed anchorageindependent growth of MDA-MB-468 cells (P < 0.0001; Fig. 2D).
These data indicate that expression of DN p38 inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells in an anchorage-dependent and
-independent manner.
We then analyzed the cell cycle distribution of MDA-MB-468 cells
expressing the DN p38. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A, 27%
of the MDA-MB-468/pcDNA3 cells were in S phase 24 hours after
serum stimulation. However, only 16% of MDA-MB-468/Flag-DN
p38 cells were in S phase at that time point. There was a second
G1-S progression 48 hours after serum stimulation. The percentage
of cells in S phase was 15% and 10% for MDA-MB-468/pcDNA3s
and MDA-MB-468/Flag-DN p38s, respectively. We did not observe
apoptosis induced by expression of DN p38 (data not shown). These
data suggest that the antiproliferation effect caused by expression
of DN p38 is due to inhibition of G1-S cell cycle progression. Because
cyclin D1 is a major regulator of G1-S progression, we measured
RNA (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and protein levels (Supplementary
Fig. S1C) of cyclin D1 and found that the induction of cyclin D1
was blocked in MDA-MB-468 cells expressing DN p38 after serum
stimulation.
Silencing of p38α, but not p38δ, by siRNA inhibits proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells. To investigate the effect of individual p38 isoforms on breast cancer cell proliferation, we used
siRNA to specifically silence p38α and p38δ. As shown in Fig. 1,
p38α and p38δ are the two most abundant isoforms in breast
cancer cell lines and in human breast tumors. MDA-MB-468
cells were transfected with siRNAs to either p38α or p38δ. Cells
transfected with siRNA dilution buffer (mock transfection) or
nonspecific (siLuciferase) siRNA were used as controls. After
24 hours, we replated the transfected cells for MTS growth assays, mRNA, and protein analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
p38α mRNA level was decreased by nearly 80% when p38α siRNA, but not p38δ siRNA, was transfected. Likewise, p38δ expression is suppressed by p38δ siRNA, but not p38α siRNA.
We did not detect p38 total protein by Western blot in cells
transfected with p38α siRNA (Fig. 3B). In addition, p38α siRNA
by both pools of siRNA or by individual duplexes caused loss of
MAPKAPK-2 protein expression. One possible reason might be
that p38α is required for the stability of MAPKAPK-2. On the
other hand, silencing of the p38δ gene with p38δ siRNA did not
decrease p38 total protein or MAPKAPK-2 expression or
phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that p38δ does
not phosphorylate MAPKAPK-2 in these cells, presumably because p38δ is not as abundant as p38α. With these data confirming the knockdown of p38 expression and suppression of
p38 activity, we next tested the effect of the p38α siRNA or
p38δ siRNA on MDA-MB-468 cell proliferation. As shown in
Fig. 3C, p38α siRNA alone inhibited cell proliferation by ∼50%
(P = 0.0463), whereas p38δ siRNA alone had no significant
effect on cell proliferation (P = 0.3318). These data suggest that
p38α, but not p38δ, is the major mediator of proliferation signaling in MDA-MB-468 cells. Blockade of p38 signaling by silencing p38α gene alone is sufficient to inhibit MDA-MB-468
cell proliferation.

Figure 3. Silencing p38α gene with siRNA inhibited MDA-MB-468 cell growth.
A, Q-RT-PCR was used to measure p38α and p38δ mRNA levels 2 d after
transfection. Relative p38α and p38δ mRNA abundance was normalized to
that of cyclophilin (n = 3). B, four days after transfection, cells were treated
with DMSO (−) or 50 ng/mL anisomycin for 15 min. Levels of total p38, total
MAPKAPK-2, and β-actin were measured by Western blot. C, transfected cells
(2 × 103) were plated in 96-well plates. Proliferation was measured by MTS
assay every 24 h (n = 4). p38α significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-468
cells (P = 0.0463), whereas p38δ had no significant effect (P = 0.3318).

p38 inhibitors suppress breast cancer cell proliferation. To
further confirm whether p38 is involved in regulating breast cancer cell proliferation, we blocked p38 signaling using two pharmacologic p38 inhibitors: SB203580 and AZ10164773. Both of these
compounds can bind the ATP-binding pocket of the p38 enzyme
and inhibit p38 activity by blocking the binding of ATP. We measured the proliferation of a panel of ER-positive and ER-negative
breast cancer cells using cell counts in the presence of increasing
amounts of SB203580 or AZ10164773 (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
AZ10164773 is a more potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell
growth than SB203580. Of the cell lines analyzed, MDA-MB-468

cells are the most sensitive to p38 blockade. SB203580 blocked
the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells by >50% at 9 μmol/L,
whereas <0.1 μmol/L of AZ10164773 had the same effect.
SB203580 and AZ10164773 inhibited the proliferation of other
breast cancer cell lines tested (MDA-MB-361, BT474, MDA-MB453, MDA-MB-231, and BT20) to various degrees (Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, the proliferation of MCF-7
and ZR75-1 cells is only moderately inhibited by either of the p38
inhibitors, whereas normal breast cells (HMECs) and immortalized breast cells (MCF10A) were not inhibited. MCF-7 and
ZR75-1 cells differ from the rest of the cell lines used in this
study (27) in that they express p53WT (28, 29). These data suggest

that p53 status may be associated with the cell's sensitivity to p38
inhibitors rather than the levels of p38 protein. p38 protein levels,
when normalized to β-actin, do not vary greatly between cell
lines as displayed in Table 1. However, within the group of cells
that are p53MUT, the triple-negative breast cancer cells are among
the most sensitive to p38 inhibitors.
Biochemical effects of the small molecule inhibitors were tested
in MBA-MB-468 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The cells were incubated for 1 hour in the presence of DMSO or increasing amounts
of SB203580 or AZ10164773. This was followed by stimulation with
anisomycin for 15 minutes. Results indicate that the AZ10164773
compound is more effective at inhibiting p38 pathway activation

compared with SB203580. AZ10164773 inhibited MAPKAPK-2
phosphorylation at the lowest dose tested and confirmed that
AZ10164773 inhibits p38 pathway activation more efficiently than
SB203580.
Knockdown of p53 or Wip1 in MCF7 and ZR75-30 cells sensitizes them to p38 inhibitors. We next tested whether knockdown of p53WT causes cells resistant to p38 inhibitors to become
sensitive to the growth suppressive effects of AZ10164773 (Fig. 4).
Using siRNA, we effectively inhibited p53WT mRNA expression in
MCF7 cells compared with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4A). As shown
in Fig. 4A, MCF7 cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA remain
resistant to AZ10164773, whereas MCF7 cells transfected with
siRNA against p53WT became sensitive to this p38 inhibitor (P <
0.0001). Thus, loss of p53 expression causes breast cancer cells to
become dependent on p38 for their growth.
Wip1 is a protein phosphatase that is p53 stimulated and can dephosphorylate p38. So we also wanted to test if knocking down Wip1
would have a similar effect on MCF7 cells, as did knocking down
p53WT. Wip1 was able to be effectively suppressed in the MCF7 cells
treated with Wip1 siRNA (Fig. 4B). MCF7 cells transfected with
nonspecific siRNA remain resistant to AZ10164773, whereas cells

treated with Wip1 siRNA caused them to be sensitive to the p38 inhibitor (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B). We also performed similar studies in
ZR75-30 cells (which are p53WT and resistant to p38 inhibitors).
These results showed that p53 or Wip1 knockdown in ZR75-30 cells
also induced sensitivity to the p38 inhibitor (data not shown).
These siRNA studies show that, just like p53MUT breast cancer
cells, p53WT breast cancer cells, in which p53 or Wip1 is reduced,
become dependent on p38 signals for their growth and become
sensitive to p38 inhibitors. Loss of p53 alone might cause these
cells to become resistant to other pathway inhibitors or the induction of stress, both of which were not tested in this study. However, these results show that the p38 pathway is an important
transducer of proliferative signals in the setting of an impaired p53
pathway, such occurs in ER-negative breast cancers with p53MUT.

Discussion
This study shows that p38 is an important transducer of proliferative signals in human breast cancer cells. We show that blockade of p38 signaling can inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation,
particularly those that are ER-negative and contain p53MUT. These

Figure 5. Proposed model for p38 signaling in p53
wild-type or mutant cells. p38 is activated by various
extracellular stimuli. In cells with p53WT (A), p38
phosphorylates and activates p53, leading to
p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis. p53WT is
required for the induction of Wip1, which can
dephosphorylate and inactivate p38. Thus, there exists
a negative feedback regulation among p38, p53WT, and
Wip1. p38 can also regulate ATF-2, MAPKAPK-2,
and other targets that are involved in regulating cell
cycle and cell proliferation. However, in the context of
p53WT, the predominant effect of p38 signaling may be
regulating p53-dependent apoptosis rather than cell
proliferation. On the other hand, when cells have
p53MUT (B), they cannot undergo p53-dependent
apoptosis and they lose the negative feedback
regulation involving Wip1. Signaling through p38
continues to activate proliferative pathways and
stimulates cell cycle progression and cell proliferation
through mediators, such as ATF-2 and MAPKAPK-2.
In such p53MUT cells, blockade of p38 signaling
suppresses cancer cell growth (PIGs, p53-induced
genes; ds genes, downstream genes).

studies show that sensitivity to p38 inhibitors is associated with
p53MUT and that, in cells with p53WT, knockdown of p53 induces
sensitivity to p38 blockade.
Depending on the nature of the stimuli and the cellular context,
p38 can mediate a wide variety of cellular responses. p38 induces
apoptosis in some cells (30–32) but prevents apoptosis in others
(33–38). Likewise, p38 exhibits opposing effects on cell cycle regulation (39). p38 has been shown to be involved in cell proliferation
and tumorigenesis (40, 41). Conversely a number of studies implicate p38 as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (42–44). The
reasons for such discrepancy in p38's role are still unclear.
In breast cancer patients, high levels of p38 have been correlated
with highly invasive and poor prognostic breast cancer (19–22). In
this report we present direct evidence that p38 can transduce proliferative signals in breast cancer cells that have p53MUT (Fig. 5)
and that the proliferation of these cells is dependent upon intact
p38 signaling. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in breast cancer (45). Wip1 expression is regulated in a p53dependent manner (46). Wip1 negatively regulates the activity of
p38 by dephosphorylating Thr180, reducing p38-induced phosphorylation of p53 and suppressing p53-mediated transcription and
apoptosis (47). Cells expressing p53WT maintain the negative feedback regulation of the p38-p53WT-Wip1 signaling. In the context of
a cell expressing p53WT, signaling through p38 may predominantly
lead to p53-mediated apoptosis rather than proliferation (Fig. 5A).
Conversely, cells that contain a p53MUT lose the ability to undergo
p53-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that under this condition, the function of p38 in these cells is shifted to regulate proliferation (Fig. 5B). p53MUT cells also lose the feedback regulation by
Wip1. This may promote dependency upon p38 for their proliferation — “p38 addiction.” In such p38-addicted cells, p38 blockade
inhibits proliferation.
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-361 cells have DNA amplification at 17q23,
the region that contains the Wip1 gene (48) and thus overexpress
the Wip1 protein. It is arguable that the high endogenous levels of
Wip1 cause the cells to become independent of p38 for proliferation. However, MDA-MB-361 cells, despite having high endogenous
Wip1 expression, have a p53MUT and are relatively sensitive to p38
blockade. This suggests that it is the dynamic balance among p38-

p53WT-Wip1 and not the constitutive expression of Wip1, which is
associated with the lack of growth suppression.
There is a significant negative correlation between levels of
p53 and steroid hormone receptors (49). Most of the existing ERnegative breast cancer cell lines have p53 somatic mutations. Our
data show that the ER-negative and p53MUT breast cancer cell lines
are more sensitive to p38 blockade than are the ER-positive and
p53WT breast cell lines. However, there may be a range of sensitivity depending on the acquisition of additional mutations that
could confer a growth advantage. Our findings that p38 inhibitors
significantly suppress the growth of ER-negative p53MUT breast
cancer cells suggest that targeting p38 signaling may be clinically
useful for the treatment of the highly aggressive triple-negative
breast cancers that are p53MUT. p38 inhibitors are now being tested
for treatment of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular diseases, and have been well tolerated
with minimal side effects (50). Based on these studies, clinical trials
of p38 inhibitors, alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, should be considered for the treatment of patients with
ER-negative p53MUT breast cancer.
