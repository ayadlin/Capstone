toxicity of therapy and patient/physician acceptance.

METHODS. The impact of completion versus noncompletion of intended treatment steps was examined in protocols TT2 (n 5 668) and TT3 (n 5 303) on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS).

RESULTS. By using appropriate landmarks of 36 months with TT2 and 18 months
with TT3, representing the maxima to completion of premaintenance phases,
postconsolidation OS was superior for 211 patients completing versus 311
patients not completing premaintenance steps on TT2 (P 5 .001), which also pertained to the 161 patients completing versus 47 not completing intended treat-

ment steps on TT3 (P 5 .01). On multivariate analysis that included all patients,
completion of therapy independently favored longer OS and EFS in the context
of both standard prognostic factors and gene expression profiling-defined risk; in
addition, TT3 prolonged EFS over results obtained with TT2.

CONCLUSIONS. 1) Completion of intended therapy was a significant independent
variable conferring superior OS and EFS in TT programs; and 2) after adjusting
for completion of therapy, EFS was still superior with TT3 versus TT2, supporting
the beneficial role of bortezomib included in TT3. Collectively, these data point
to the importance of designing clinical trials that balance the treatment requirements for disease control with host acceptance and tolerance. Cancer

O

ur Total Therapy (TT) programs, modeled after those of St. Jude
Hospital for children with acute leukemia, have been geared to
bring to the frontline the entire treatment armamentarium available
at any given time in an effort to maximally reduce tumor burden
and thus avoid the development of resistance.1 Appreciating that
multiple myeloma (MM) is a more hypoproliferative tumor than
many other hematologic malignancies, the onset of complete remission (CR) occurs gradually over the course of 12 months to 18
months despite the use of high-dose therapy.2,3 TT protocols used
remission induction therapy, followed by melphalan (MEL)-based
tandem transplants and maintenance treatment. In TT2 we introduced more intensive, hematopoietic growth factor-requiring induction regimens before and, for the first time, consolidation

THAL, the drug was continued indefinitely until disease progression or untoward toxicity.
We now examine the impact of completion versus noncompletion of all intended treatment steps in
complex protocols TT2 (n 5 668) and TT3 (n 5 303)
on clinical outcomes per protocol and across protocols.

chemotherapy after transplants, before the maintenance phase.4 Thus, the TT protocols are very complex and their execution over the course of several
years is fraught with patient attrition due to failure
and toxicity of therapy and patient/physician acceptance. We therefore pondered the question whether
patients’ clinical outcome depended on the rate of
compliance with intended protocols, which was
determined by patient and physician preference,
toxicities incurred, and insurance/financial considerations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Treatment Details
Regimen details of TT2 and TT3 have recently been
published4–7 and their essential features are summarized in Figure 1. Briefly, TT3 used abbreviated induction and consolidation therapies with 2 rather than 4
cycles each in TT2, on the assumption that the addition of bortezomib (V) to DT-PACE (dexamethasone
[DEX], thalidomide [THAL], cisplatin, doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, etoposide) in VDT-PACE would
be highly synergistic so that comparable antitumor
activity would be delivered with 2 rather than 4
cycles. As a result, we anticipated and indeed accomplished higher compliance with both transplants so
that the intended therapies could be delivered to a
higher proportion of patients. Drug-free phases of
TT2 were ‘bridged’ by THAL-DEX in an effort to
suppress the potentially MM-stimulatory signals
associated with postchemotherapy hematopoietic recovery. Finally, bortezomib was combined with
THAL-DEX in VTD, which was applied in monthly
cycles during the first year of maintenance, followed
by THAL-DEX for 2 more years. In TT2, maintenance
was comprised of interferon with added DEX pulsing
during the first year; in case of randomization to

Laboratory Investigations
Protocol-directed laboratory monitoring for response
and toxicities was applied with both trials as
reported previously.4,6 Standard laboratory studies
included hemogram and multichemical scans. Cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) were detected by metaphase analysis of Giemsa-banded chromosomes in
20 cells.8 By using the Affymetrix platform,9 gene
expression profiling (GEP) was performed on CD138purified plasma cells to establish a risk score applying a 70 gene model, as recently published.10
Clinical Endpoints of Study
Response and relapse definitions used criteria similar
to those reported by Blade et al.7,11 CR required the
absence of M-protein in serum and urine on immunofixation analysis as well as normal bone marrow
aspirate and biopsy by microscopy and flow cytometry (absence of aneuploidy and monoclonal cytoplasmic light chain); in addition, metaphase CAs had to
be absent. Response criteria had to be documented
on at least 2 subsequent occasions at least 2 months
apart. Relapse from CR suggested the reappearance
of M-protein in serum or urine on immunofixation,
reappearance of monoclonal bone marrow plasmacytosis or of CA, the development of extramedullary
disease or of new bone lesions recognized on at least
annually performed magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) or skeletal survey. Nonsecretory relapses in the
absence of M-protein recurrence also constituted
relapse, such as new focal lesions on MRI or positron
emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography
(CT) scan, reemergence of bone marrow monoclonal
plasmacytosis, or extramedullary disease often associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH).
Statistical Methods
The Kaplan-Meier Method was used in estimating
event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS),12
with group comparisons made using the log-rank
test. EFS was defined as the time from the date of
registration to death from any cause, disease progression, or relapse. Patients experiencing no event were
censored at the time of last contact. OS was defined
from the date of registration until death from any

contact. The cumulative incidence of CR was estimated using the method outlined in Gooley et al.13;
results of different trials were compared using the
log-rank test. Multivariate models of prognostic factors were carried out using Cox regression.14

Informed Consent
Both the TT3 and TT2 protocols were approved by
the Institutional Review Board and the Food and
Drug Administration. Patients signed an informed
consent indicating that they understood the investigative nature of the trials along with treatment alternatives, in keeping with Institutional Review Board,
National Institutes of Health, and Food and Drug
Administration policies.
Audits of Response and Toxicity Data
Response and toxicity details had been monitored by
an independent certified audit team that reviewed
data on 285 of 303 patients enrolled in TT3 and on
651 of 668 patients enrolled in TT2. A Safety and
Monitoring Board reviewed data twice and gave permission for article submission.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Data presented in Table 1 show that prognostically
relevant parameters were similar in patients treated
on TT3 and TT2 regimens. Notably, the proportions

of patients with CA as the major standard adverse
prognostic feature in our TT trials were in the 30%
range, and GEP-defined high-risk percentages were
virtually identical in TT2 and TT3 protocols. Differences were observed with regard to greater representation of patients in TT3 who were older than 65
years of age, had advanced International Staging
System for multiple myeloma (ISS) stage II, anemia,
elevation of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels and
hypoalbuminemia; also, higher C-reactive protein
(CRP) levels were more frequent in TT2. The median
follow-up of live patients on TT3 is 2 years and on
TT2 5 years.

Clinical Outcomes According to the Completion of
Protocol Steps
Thirty-six months were required to complete all premaintenance steps in TT2 and only 18 months in
TT3 (Fig. 2). Postmaintenance OS in TT2 (36 months
landmark) was superior for the 211 patients completing versus the 311 patients not completing premaintenance steps (P 5 .001), which pertained regardless
of the absence (P 5 .04) or presence of CAs (P 5 .03)
(Fig. 3a–c). Postmaintenance OS in TT3 (18 months
landmark) was also superior among the 161 patients
who completed versus the 47 who did not complete
premaintenance steps (P 5 .01), pertaining especially
to those with CA (P 5 .006) (Fig. 3d-f). Comparing
TT3 versus TT2 outcomes and using a joint landmark
of 27 months (mean of maxima to maintenance for
TT2 and TT3), 1-year postlandmark EFS estimates
were 98% with TT3 versus 90% with TT2 (P 5 .04)
(Fig. 4a); OS was not different (Fig. 4b).

results pertained to EFS (Table 2). Additional independently significant variables were baseline CA,
GEP-defined risk, LDH and creatinine for both OS
and EFS, along with CR as a favorable time-dependent variable. EFS was also significantly prolonged by
TT3 versus TT2, supporting a critical contribution of
bortezomib to TT3’s success.

DISCUSSION
Clinical trial designs need to take into consideration
the objectives of therapy and the host for whom the
treatment is prescribed. In the case of MM, palliation
had been the mainstay of therapeutic intent for decades until, with the advent of autotransplantsupported high-dose melphalan, the emphasis shifted
toward prolonging EFS and OS through markedly
enhancing the frequency of CR. Once CR rates
reached the 50% mark with tandem transplants, the
term ‘cure’ could be entertained in earnest, as such
levels had been critical to observing continuous CRs
and cures in acute leukemia, as a result of profound
tumor cytoreduction and lack of regrowth in a subset
of such patients.
As we embarked on the TT concepts in 1989
with TT1, the median times to CR onset for those
achieving CR status were 8 months in TT1, 10

months in TT2, and 7 months in TT3. In the latter
study we purposely shortened induction and consolidation phases before and after tandem transplant,
respectively, to attempt to increase compliance with
the intended therapies without sacrificing efficacy
through the addition of bortezomib, a goal that
indeed was accomplished.6,7
Here we show that completion of premaintenance treatment steps significantly extended OS in
both TT2 and TT3, using appropriate 36 months and
18 months landmarks (see Fig. 3a,c). In both protocols we demonstrated that the major benefit of completion of intended therapies was derived by patients
with high-risk features as defined by CA in both TT2
and TT3 studies (see Fig. 3b,d). Applying a joint
landmark of 27 months for both trials (mean of maxima required in TT3 and TT2 to complete premaintenance steps), we observed that TT3 was superior to
TT2 among the subjects completing premaintenance
steps in terms of EFS but not OS, which may be an
issue in short follow-up (see Fig. 4).
Interestingly, when Cox regression analyses were
used to determine whether completion of intended
treatment steps was an independent feature for clinical outcome of the entire population, we indeed
noted this to be the case for both OS and EFS regardless of risk and how it was defined (by CA or GEP).

Clinical Trial Compliance and Prognosis in Myeloma/Barlogie et al.

Attaining CR status independently favored superior
OS and EFS in the context of SPF alone and with
GEP. Importantly, CA and elevated serum levels of
both LDH and creatinine still conferred independently adverse implications for OS and EFS in both
models with and without GEP.
We conclude from these observations: 1) completion of intended therapy was an independently significant variable conferring superior OS and EFS in
TT programs; 2) attaining CR was beneficial independent of completion of therapy; and 3) the superior performance of TT3 versus TT2 for EFS,
independent of completion of intended treatment
steps, supports the beneficial role of bortezomib
included in TT3. Collectively, these data point to the
importance of executing in their entirety clinical
trials designed to significantly prolong survival in
MM. It will be important to determine whether, in
the case of new agent combinations such as MPT
(melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide) or MPT with
added bortezomib, greater compliance with intended
therapies is at least partially responsible for their
unexpected high success rate.15,16
