BACKGROUND. Significant controversy surrounds the use of remission induction
chemotherapy (IC) in older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Earlier
clinical trials have yielded conflicting results and possibly a minor survival benefit, often offset by a longer hospitalization time.

METHODS. To evaluate the role of IC in patients with AML, a case control study
of patients 60 years or older treated at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center between 1997 and 2005 was conducted. Forty-four patients who did not
receive IC were matched by a propensity analysis to 138 patients who received
an anthracycline-based regimen.

53 days, compared with 197 days (P < .001) for those who did. After further
adjusting for age, gender, race, leukocyte count at presentation, AML cytogenetreceiving IC was still associated with worse survival (hazards ratio of 1.88; 95%
confidence interval, 1.15–3.05 [P 5 .01]). Additional predictors of poor outcomes
in older adults with AML included higher leukocyte count at presentation, poorrisk cytogenetics, and African-American race (compared with Caucasians).

t is estimated that approximately 13,400 patients will be diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the U.S. in 2007.1
AML is a disorder that afflicts mainly older adults, with a median
age at diagnosis of 67 years. Standard therapy involves remission
induction with intensive combination chemotherapy, which often
consists of an anthracycline or anthracenedione and cytarabine.2–5
For younger adults, this approach results in a long-term disease-free
survival of approximately 30% at the cost of a treatment-related
mortality of 5% to 10%.5–7 These outcomes are significantly worse
for older adults, who have a dismal long-term disease-free survival
of less than 10%, and a treatment-related mortality as high as 20%
to 30%.4,5,8,9
Whereas remission induction therapy prolongs survival and
allows for a significant disease-free interval in younger adults, its
benefit in older adults is not as obvious.2 Two studies, performed
approximately 2 decades ago, have attempted to address this question. The first randomized 71 patients older than 65 years of age
with newly diagnosed AML to remission induction therapy (with
daunorubicin, vincristine, and cytarabine) or supportive care

(including low-dose chemotherapy for the palliation
of symptoms of acute leukemia).10 This trial noted a
significant median survival benefit of only 10 weeks
for patients receiving remission induction chemotherapy—approximately the same amount of time
these patients spent in the hospital, compared with
those randomized to receive best supportive care or
nonintensive chemotherapy. The second study, by
Tilly et al.,11 randomized 87 older patients to lowdose cytarabine (nonintensive chemotherapy) or
induction chemotherapy with the combination of an
anthracycline and cytarabine, but showed no statistically significant survival difference between the 2
groups (median survival 8.8 months in the nonintensive chemotherapy group vs 12.8 months in the
induction chemotherapy group).11 In addition,
patients receiving induction chemotherapy required
greater transfusion support, had a longer hospital
stay, and had a higher treatment-related mortality.11
More recently, Menzin et al.12 surveyed the SEERMedicare database and compared the outcomes of
patients treated with chemotherapy to those who
had not received chemotherapy after adjusting for
age, comorbidities, and geographical region. Whereas
patients who received chemotherapy had a superior
median survival than those who had not received
chemotherapy (6.1 vs 1.7 months; P < .0001), the
cohort treated with chemotherapy included patients
who received nonintensive chemotherapy as well as
remission induction chemotherapy.12
Because of the high treatment-related mortality,
and poor overall outcomes of remission induction
therapy, many older patients with AML forego induction chemotherapy in favor of less aggressive therapy
with hydroxurea, cytarabine, and more recently
hypomethylating agents (such as azacitidine and
decitabine),2,13 often at the recommendation of their
physicians. With improvements in supportive care,
however, older patients can increasingly be supported through induction chemotherapy with greater
success. Similarly, advances in nonintensive chemotherapy have occurred: Low-dose cytarabine was
found to result in a survival advantage compared
with hydroxyurea, immunomodulatory agents have
shown efficacy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and AML, and the hypomethylating agent
decitabine was superior to induction chemotherapy
in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS).13–16 Given the controversy surrounding the
relative benefit of induction chemotherapy, and
advances in nonintensive chemotherapy approaches
(including supportive care), it is not clear whether or
not the decision to withhold remission induction
therapy from older adults is valid.

We performed a case-control study to compare
the outcomes of older adults with AML who received
induction chemotherapy and those who did not to
address this question.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 457 patients with AML evaluated at the
Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center between 1997
and 2005 were identified. An AML diagnosis was
based on morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic review, with classification according to
the French-American-British system17 or, beginning
in 2001, by the World Health Organization classification.18 Two patients were excluded for missing data
and 48 patients did not receive remission induction
chemotherapy. Of the remaining 407 patients, 280
patients received systemic therapy at Cleveland
Clinic, whereas the remainder received AML therapy
at the referring institution. After restricting the sample to age 60 years, 44 patients did not receive
remission induction chemotherapy, whereas 138
patients did (Fig. 1). Patients’ records were reviewed
for demographic data, laboratory data, AML etiology
(de novo or secondary [including those after an antecedent hematologic disorder or treatment-related]),
and survival outcomes. A patient was considered to
have cardiac comorbidities if he/she had a history
of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy, history of
symptomatic valvular heart disease, or an echocardiogram demonstrating an ejection fraction 50%.
Renal dysfunction was defined as a serum creatinine
1.5 mg/dL. Hepatic dysfunction was defined as a
serum alkaline phosphatase or alanine transaminase
greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (150
U/L and 50 U/L, respectively). AML cytogenetics
were recorded as favorable, intermediate, adverse, or
missing (no growth or not available) based on the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) classification system.19 Briefly, good-risk cytogenetics comprised the following: inversion 16 or translocation
(16;16) and translocation (8;21); intermediate-risk cytogenetics included: normal karyotype, deletion Y,
deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 (29q), or
addition of chromosomes 11, 13, or 21; adverse-risk
cytogenetics included: complex cytogenetics (3 or
more abnormalities), addition of chromosome 8, and
deletion of chromosome 7. Performance status was
not recorded for many patients and hence was not
included in this analysis. This study was approved by
the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board.

Therapy
Patients treated with remission induction chemotherapy received combination therapy with an anthracycline or anthracenedione (consisting of daunorubicin,
mitoxantrone, or idarubicin) and cytarabine. Postremission therapy consisted of cytarabine-based regimens.
Patients who opted against induction chemotherapy
received supportive measures, consisting of antibiotics
and transfusion support when indicated. In addition,
nonintensive chemotherapy patients received low-dose
subcutaneous cytarabine, hydroxyurea, azacitidine, or
arsenic trioxide-based therapy at the discretion of the
treating physicians usually for the palliation of symptoms of AML and control of leukocytosis.
Statistical Analysis
The outcome of the study was survival time measured from the date of diagnosis. A Cox proportional
hazards model was developed as a basic approach to
predict overall survival. The exponential of the parameter estimate represented the hazards ratio (HR)
associated with an increase of 1 unit in an independent variable, assuming all other covariates remained
constant. The Cox proportional hazards model takes
maximum advantage of each subject’s available data
even though subjects were tracked for different
lengths of time, and the outcome of interest might
not have occurred. Therefore, subjects exited the
cohort at the time of death or at the last follow-up,
whichever occurred first.
A case-control study was designed in which
cases comprised patients opting against induction
chemotherapy and controls represented patients who
received induction chemotherapy. As it is possible
that a patient’s baseline characteristics could have
influenced both the type of therapy selected (intensive vs nonintensive chemotherapy) and the outcome

of interest, a propensity score method was used to
address potential sample selection bias and to better
balance the patient characteristics.20 A logistic
regression was used first to predict the probabilities
(P) of receiving no induction chemotherapy versus
induction chemotherapy using individual characteristics: age, gender, race, leukocyte count at presentation, AML cytogenetics, secondary AML, and comorbid conditions including renal dysfunction, hepatic
dysfunction, and cardiac comorbidity. The propensity
scores were achieved by taking the logit of the predicted probability (ie, log[(12p)/p]), to normalize the
distribution of the scores. The cases and controls
were matched by propensity scores 1:3, with the
nearest neighbor being matched with a replacement.21 The matching was restricted by a radius of
0.5 to limit the risk of imprecise matches if the closest neighbor was numerically distant.22
The purpose of propensity score matching is to
balance the patient characteristics between the comparison groups. Thus, chi-square tests were used for
categorical variables and Student t-tests were used
for continuous variables to examine the extent to
which the matching procedure resulted in comparable samples. The matched samples were used as the
analytic dataset for this approach. For matching with
replacement, the weight of the sample was considered where case units were weighted at 1 and the
weight for a control is the number of times it is
matched to a case unit. In addition, robust standard
errors were adjusted.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred and eighty-two patients (44 patients
who did not receive induction chemotherapy [cases]
and 138 patients who received induction chemotherapy [controls]) were the subjects of this study. The
median age of patients who did not receive induction
chemotherapy was 75 years (range, 60–92 years), and
19 patients were female (43%). Patients who did not
receive induction chemotherapy were generally older
than patients who received induction chemotherapy
before matching (median age, 75 vs 68 years in the
nonintensive chemotherapy and induction chemotherapy groups, respectively; P < .0001). Gender and
race were not significantly different between the 2
groups. However, patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy were more likely than patients
who received induction chemotherapy to have missing cytogenetics (43% vs 17%; P < .0001), but less
likely to have intermediate-risk cytogenetics (20% vs
43%; P < .01). The leukocyte count at presentation

Baseline comorbidities were similar in the 2 groups
with the exception of a higher prevalence of renal
dysfunction among patients who received induction
chemotherapy (27% vs 12%; P < .05). After matching
for propensity scores, the patients who received
induction chemotherapy and those who did not
receive induction chemotherapy were no different

Patient characteristics are summarized in Table
1 (before matching) and in Table 2 (after propensity

Survival and Outcomes
The median survival for patients who received nonintensive chemotherapy was 53 days, compared with
197 days for patients who received induction chemotherapy (Fig. 2) (log-rank P < .0001). Among patients
who received induction chemotherapy, 87 (63%)
achieved a complete remission (CR), whereas none
of the patients who received nonintensive chemotherapy achieved a CR. The 4-week and 8-week mor-

who received induction chemotherapy, whereas the
4-week and 8-week mortality for patients who did
not receive induction chemotherapy was 28% and
52%, respectively. After further adjustment for age,
gender, race, leukocyte count at presentation, cytogenetics, and AML etiology (de novo vs secondary),
withholding induction chemotherapy remained associated with worse outcomes (HR of 1.88; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.15–3.05 [P 5 .011]). In

As expected, both favorable and intermediate AML cytogenetics was associated with better survival compared with adverse cytogenetics (HR of 0.29;, 95% CI,

analyses are reported in Table 3.

Additional Testing to Validate the Model
Because knowledge of the patient’s cytogenetics may
impact the decision to deliver or withhold induction
chemotherapy, additional analyses were performed.
The interaction between AML cytogenetics and treatment decision was added to the proportional hazards
model, but it did not achieve a level of statistical significance (data not shown). In addition, subgroup
analyses in which adverse risk or missing cytogenetics were respectively excluded were performed.
When patients with adverse risk cytogenetics were
excluded from the model, and after controlling for all
other covariates (age, gender, race, WBC at presentation, other cytogenetics, and AML etiology), not
receiving induction chemotherapy remained associated with worse outcomes; because of the smaller
sample size, this did not achieve the level of statisti-

cal significance (HR of 1.62; 95% CI, 0.85–3.10
[P 5 .14]). However, when patients with missing
cytogenetics were excluded, not receiving induction
chemotherapy remained significantly associated
with worse outcomes (HR of 2.35; 95% CI, 1.26–4.40
[P 5 .007]).
The propensity score matching yielded more
balanced groups in terms of the measured covariates.
All of the variables with statistically significant differences before matching had no significant differences
after matching (Tables 1 and 2). The Cox proportional hazards model with 1:3 matching sample
demonstrated that nonintensive chemotherapy
remains associated with shorter survival (HR of 2.14;
95% CI, 1.23–3.75 [P 5 .007]) (Table 4).
To account for the fact that patients with poor
performance status might not survive greater than 1
week regardless of whether they receive chemotherapy,
patients who had died within 1 week of diagnosis were
excluded (n 5 6) and nonintensive chemotherapy
remained associated with shorter survival compared
with intensive chemotherapy (HR of 1.76; 95% CI,
1.06–2.90 [P 5 .028]).

DISCUSSION
The management of older adults with AML is far
from straightforward. For patients not thought to be

Induction Therapy in Older Adults With AML/Baz et al.

good candidates for intensive chemotherapy, the use
of low-dose cytarabine is currently considered a
standard treatment strategy.14 For older adults who
are eligible for induction chemotherapy, considerable
controversy persists. Whereas approximately 40% to
50% of patients will achieve a CR with this approach,
a significant number will not survive induction
chemotherapy. Less aggressive chemotherapy (such
as low-dose cytarabine) will achieve a lower CR rate,
but to our knowledge has not been compared with
remission induction chemotherapy.14 Kantarjian
et al.15 compared the outcomes of a cohort of patient
with high-risk MDS treated with decitabine with a
historic cohort of patients who received intensive
chemotherapy. After matching for age, International
Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics, patients
who received decitabine had a similar CR rate and
survival benefit of approximately 10 months compared with patients treated with intensive chemotherapy.15 It is unclear whether these findings can be
applied to older patients with AML.
Because prior studies had suggested an overall
survival benefit of induction chemotherapy, which is
often completely or partially offset by prolonged hospitalization and decreased quality of life, and
because of the very small number of patients who
derive long-term disease-free survival from induction
chemotherapy, this approach may not be offered to,
or accepted by, patients.2,3,23 Our study suggests a
more substantial survival benefit to induction chemotherapy in a more contemporary series.
In this study, age, leukocyte count at presentation, race, AML cytogenetics, and treatment (induction chemotherapy vs withholding induction
chemotherapy) were found to influence outcomes.
These predictive factors have been validated among
patients who received remission induction chemotherapy by other investigators.5,24–28 African-American
race was identified as a poor prognostic factor in this
study. This is in agreement with data from the CALGB
that noted a worse complete remission rate and
survival of African-American patients, particularly
African-American men, with AML.24 In that study,
because all patients were enrolled on CALGB leukemia trials, access to care and treatment variability
were eliminated as possible causative factors for
the difference in outcome, leaving the possibility of
true biologic heterogeneity. It is difficult to know in
the current study what factors play into the worse
outcome experienced by African-Americans.
Patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy had an overall survival of 53 days (approximately 8 weeks) in this study. This is in contrast to
the study by Lowenberg et al.,10 which reported a

1757

median survival of 11 weeks for patients who did not
receive induction chemotherapy. However, the former study included patients eligible to receive induction chemotherapy, who were likely healthier than in
the present study. It is interesting to note that
patients who received induction chemotherapy in
the present study had a comparable overall survival
and CR rate to that reported by Lowenberg et al. in
1990 (overall survival, 28 weeks vs 21 weeks; CR rate
of 63% vs 58%). The group that did not receive
induction chemotherapy had a shorter survival than
patients who received nonintensive chemotherapy in
the study by Tilly et al.11, although patients in that
study received low-dose cytarabine, which has been
shown to produce a CR rate of 18% and to have a
survival advantage over treatment with hydroxyurea.14 Survivals noted among induction chemotherapy patients in the present study, as well as risk
factors for outcome, are similar to other large studies
in older AML patients, and to the study by Tilly
et al.8,11,29,30 Improved CR rates and survival duration
in the present study may also reflect improvement in
supportive care in older adults in the current era,
including the routine use of better antifungal agents,
compared with older studies.
This study has several potential limitations. The
nonrandomized, retrospective nature may have
resulted in the introduction of bias. Specifically,
treating physicians may have advocated to patients
an approach avoiding intensive chemotherapy in the
presence of indicators suggesting poor outcomes
with this approach. Important factors when considering intensive chemotherapy in this group of patients
include patient age and comorbidities, performance
status, secondary AML, and cytogenetics. With the
exception of patient performance status, these factors were accounted for in this analysis and the benefit of induction chemotherapy persisted. Whereas
exploratory analysis excluding patients experiencing
an early death were performed to nullify the impact
poor performance status patients may have on the
results, and comorbidities were taken into account in
comparing the groups, these analyses likely do not
account fully for the impact of the performance status on survival, which cannot be inferred from this
study.
In addition, although a retrospective analysis of
induction chemotherapy versus no induction chemotherapy in older AML patients is not ideal, it is likely
the only source of evidence for this question, as prospective randomized trials are unlikely to be performed. One attempt to randomize patients to
nonintensive chemotherapy and induction chemotherapy was terminated early because of poor patient

accrual.31 In particular, case-control studies are often
criticized for the selection of controls because this
group can make cases look either better or worse if
not well matched. Because nearly identical results
were obtained from both the basic regression
approach and propensity score approach, this confirms the validity of the study results.
In conclusion, remission induction chemotherapy in older adults with AML is associated with a significant survival benefit (of approximately 28 weeks)
compared with nonintensive chemotherapy. Older
adults with AML should not be denied induction
chemotherapy because of age alone, and can be
informed that induction chemotherapy does appear
to provide a survival advantage, albeit based on retrospective data. Because few older AML patients
achieve long-term disease-free survival, however,
clinical trial participation should be encouraged in
this group of patients.
