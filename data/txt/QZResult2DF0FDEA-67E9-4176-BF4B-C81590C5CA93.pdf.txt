Drugging the “undruggable” DNA-binding domain of STAT3
Jian-Ting Zhang and Jing-Yuan Liu
STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3) is a transcription factor in the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway in response to extracellular cytokines
and growth factors [1]. STAT3 is constitutively activated
in human malignancies and has been shown to play an
important role in many facets of human cancers including
oncogenesis, angiogenesis, metastasis, immune evasion,
and EMT [2]. Thus, STAT3 has been a sought-after target
for drug discovery. Although many STAT3 inhibitors have
been identified and studied over the last decade including
peptidomimetics and small molecule compounds [3],
most of them target the SH2 domain, inhibiting activation
and dimerization of STAT3 (Figure 1). This approach
has yet to result in an FDA-approved STAT3-targeting
therapeutics. Recently, STAT3-selective small molecule
inhibitors targeting the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of
STAT3 were identified that effectively inhibited growth
and metastasis of xenograft tumors [4, 5], which may have
the potential to be further developed as cancer therapeutics
targeting STAT3.

DBDs of transcription factors and DNA damage
repair proteins are generally considered “undruggable”
with flat and similar surface areas [6, 7], which may not
allow appropriate and selective inhibitor binding. Thus,
these domains and sometimes the entire proteins are
avoided as targets for drug discovery. In a recent study
[4], Huang et al. challenged this prevailing taboo by
developing an improved in-silico screening approach
to eliminate potential non-selective inhibitors, in which
top-scoring compounds targeting the DBD of STAT3 off
the in-silico screening of a ChemDiv chemical library
were docked onto the DBD of STAT1. Any compounds
that were predicted to also bind to the DBD of STAT1
were eliminated due to potential lack of selectivity. This
improved approach helped the authors identify a STAT3selective hit molecule, inS3-54, which inhibited cancer
cell proliferation with an IC50 of 3.2-5.4 µM in multiple
cancer cell lines by inhibiting STAT3-dependent gene
expression and inducing apoptosis [4]. However, inS354 had poor pharmacokinetics and was not absorbed in
animal studies.

To improve the pharmacokinetic properties of inS354, Huang et al. [5] analyzed 69 analogues of inS3-54
and identified three analogues that were more effective
than inS3-54 with IC50 of 1.8-5.3 µM against multiple
cancer cell lines. These active analogues were not only
selective to STAT3 over STAT1 as demonstrated using
electrophoretic mobility shift assay, they had no effect on
the survival of STAT3-null hematopoietic progenitor cells,
suggesting that they are likely specific to STAT3. One of
the effective analogues, inS3-54A18, was selected as a
lead compound because it was soluble in a proprietary oral
formulation suitable for in-vivo study and demonstrated
to not only effectively inhibit cancer cell survival, but also
inhibited migration and invasion of cancer cells, the insitu DNA-binding activity of STAT3, and the growth and
metastasis of xenograft tumors in vivo with repeated oral
dosing.
Huang et al. also conducted structure-activity
relationship analysis of all analogues [5], which revealed
a pharmacophore, 5-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-2(3H)-ketone
core structure with different functional groups (Figure1).
Compounds with R1 being p-hydroxybenzene or
p-carboxybenzene had high while compounds with R1
being m-hydroxybenzene or m-carboxybenzene had low
or no STAT3-inhibitory activity. The active compounds
also appeared to have nitrobenzene, p-chlorobenzene, or
benzenamine while inactive ones had p-methoxylbenzene
as R2 group [5].
Although many inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain
of STAT3 have previously been reported, most of these
studies provided no direct evidence that these inhibitors
indeed bind to the intended targeting site. In contrast,
direct and specific binding to the DBD of STAT3 by the
DBD-targeting inhibitors was validated by Huang et al [5]
using immobilized compounds and purified recombinant
STAT3 proteins of various domains in a pulldown assay.
These findings on inhibitors targeting the DBD of
STAT3 by Huang et al. [4, 5] not only provide potential
candidates for novel anticancer drug development targeting
STAT3, but also suggest that DBDs of transcription factors
can be exploited as targeting sites for drug discovery and
that the prevailing “undruggable” DBD of transcription
factors may be druggable. Thus, targeting the DBD of
oncogenic transcription factors may lead to identification
of novel inhibitors that can be developed into a new class
of therapeutics.
