ABSTRACT
Exosomes (EVs) have relevance in cell-to-cell communication carrying protumorigenic factors that participate in oncogenesis and drug resistance and are
proposed to have potential as self-delivery systems. Advancing on our studies of EVs
in triple-negative breast cancer, here we more comprehensively analysed isogenic
cell line variants and their EV populations, tissues cell line variants and their EV
populations, as well as breast tumour and normal tissues. Profiling 384 miRNAs
showed EV miRNA content to be highly representative of their cells of origin. miRNAs
most substantially down-regulated in aggressive cells and their EVs originated
from 14q32. Analysis of miR-134, the most substantially down-regulated miRNA,
supported its clinical relevance in breast tumours compared to matched normal
breast tissue. Functional studies indicated that miR-134 controls STAT5B which, in
turn, controls Hsp90. miR-134 delivered by direct transfection into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
(in which it was greatly down-regulated) reduced STAT5B, Hsp90, and Bcl-2 levels,
reduced cellular proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Delivery via
miR-134-enriched EVs also reduced STAT5B and Hsp90, reduced cellular migration
and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 drugs. While the differing effects
achieved by transfection or EV delivery are likely to be, at least partly, due to specific
amounts of miR-134 delivered by these routes, these EV-based studies identified
miRNA-134 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic for breast cancer.

tumours [9–11]. Recently, microRNA (miRNA) profiling
has been used in an attempt to discover TNBC subclassifications [12], as well as to identify biomarkers or
therapeutics for TNBC.
miRNAs [13] regulate a plethora of cellular
processes including apoptosis, proliferation and
differentiation [14], are commonly down-regulated in
cancers and have relevance as biomarkers and therapeutic
potential as tumour suppressing agents in many cancers
[15, 16], including breast cancer [17–19]. Exosomes
contain miRNAs [20] and it has been established that
miRNAs can be transferred from cell-to-cell by exosomes,

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is responsible
for 15–20% of breast cancers and it accounts for
a disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths. Poor
outcome corresponds with the innate aggressiveness of
TNBC, augmented by the lack of targeted treatments
[1–4]. Platinum-containing agents are among the drugs
showing some benefit in TNBC [5, 6]. Anti-Hsp90
drugs also show promising results [7, 8], although
some pre-clinical studies indicate TNBC to be less
sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors than HER2-overexpressing

subsequently mediating epigenetic alterations in recipient
cells [21]. It has also been shown that exosomes can be
manipulated to transfer miRNAs representing therapeutics
to recipient cells e.g. by acting in combination with VEGF
inhibitors in leukaemia treatment [22].
Previously using a TNBC cell line (Hs578T) and
its aggressive clonal variant (Hs578Ts(i)8) as models
systems, we investigated the potential of exosomes/
microvesicles (collectively termed extracellular vesicles/
EVs) to influence the phenotype of “recipient”/secondary
cells. We also assessed effects of EVs isolated from TNBC
patients’ sera compared to those from healthy volunteers.
These results indicated that the EVs released by the more
aggressive cells carried the same traits to all secondary
cell lines analysed (i.e. increasing their proliferation,
migration, and inducing neovascularisation/angiogenesis),
in a manner indicative of the innate phenotypes of the cells
of origin. Additionally, EVs from TNBC patients’ sera,
compared to those from healthy controls, increased the
invasiveness of recipient breast cancer cells [23].
Here we chose to commence our studies with the same
isogenic cell line variants (Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8) and
their corresponding EVs. Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 have the
same genetic background, which make them an interesting
comparison model. However, Hs578Ts(i)8, compared
to Hs578T cells, have a more aggressive phenotype.
Specifically they have 2.5-fold higher migratory capacity,
3-fold higher invasive (through extracellular matrix)
capacity, and form 25 times more colonies in soft agar.
Furthermore Hs578Ts(i)8, unlike Hs578T, produce tumours
in vivo in nude mice [24]. This cell line pair is, therefore,
very useful for investigating the comparative capabilities of
EVs to transfer phenotypic traits representative of their cell
of origin to secondary recipient cells. So, advancing on our
previous studies, here we profiled the miRNA content of EVs
to potentially identify mediators of the EV-induced signals
and questioned whether the EVs could be manipulated into
transporting miRNAs of choice to secondary cells, to both
decrease cell aggression and to increase their sensitivity to
anti-cancer drugs. From this, we have identified loss of miR134 in cells and their EVs to be associated with increased
cellular aggressiveness. Our functional studies support miR134′s potential use as a therapeutic agent in TNBC, through
its targeting of STAT5B [25] to subsequently reduce Hsp90
[26] and Bcl-2 expression, ultimately adding value to anticancer agents.

that our isolates had hallmarks of EVs (as we previously
described [23]), the presence of three exosomal
markers i.e. PDC6I/Alix, TSG101 and CD63 were
verified (Figure 1A). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) confirmed that our isolates were of the expected
30–100 nm in diameter, indicative of exosomes. However,
here we use the term extracellular vesicles/EVs as the
presence of some microvesicles cannot be completely
ruled out.

miRNA profiling of Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
and their respective EVs
To identify miRNAs that are substantially
altered in the more “aggressive” Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and
corresponding Hs578Ts(i)8 EVs, compared to the parent
cell line (Hs578T) and its EVs, we performed miRNA
expression profiling on biological triplicates of each of
these 4 populations. Considering both parent Hs578T
and Hs578T-derived EVs, a total of 308 miRNAs were
detected. As indicated in Figure 2A, 244 (79%) of these
miRNAs were detected in both the cells and their EVs;
24 (8%) were detected in the cells only and 40 (13%) were
detected in the EVs only. Similarly, for the Hs578Ts(i)8
cells and their EVs, a total of 270 miRNAs were detected
in both the cells and EVs, 202 (75%) of these were in
both Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and EVs with 16 (6%) in the cells
only and 51 (19%) miRNAs detected in the EVs only
(Figure 2B).
Distinct differences between the miRNA profiles of
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and Hs578Ts(i)8 EVs compared to their
parental (Hs578T) counterparts were found. As shown in
Figure 2C & 2D, there is an overall tendency for miRNAs
to be down-regulated in the more aggressive Hs578Ts(i)8
cells and their corresponding EVs, when compared
directly with Hs578T cells and EVs. Eighty-three miRNAs
were commonly down-regulated in both Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
and EVs compared to Hs578T and EVs, respectively
(Figure 2E; see Suppl. Table 1 for all 83). One miRNA,
miR-146b-3p, was at higher levels in both Hs578Ts(i)8
cells and EVs, but this was not statistically significant
(2.17 ± 0.826; p = 0.229). Figure 2F represents the fold
changes for the ten most substantially down-regulated
miRNAs in Hs578Ts(i)8 cells. Of these, miR-134 was most
substantially down-regulated in Hs578Ts(i)8 EVs versus
Hs578T EVs. Linear regression analysis showed strong
correlation between miRNAs detected in Hs578T cells and
their EVs (Figure 2G), with Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and EVs
showing a similar finding (Figure 2H).

apparent using low density arrays, miR-134, miR-370, miR889 and miR-376c were all confirmed to be at significantly
lower levels in Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and its EVs when compared
to Hs578T cells and EVs (Table 1).

Investigation of the chromosomal location for the
83 miRNAs commonly down-regulated in Hs578Ts(i)8
cells and Hs578Ts(i)8 EVs compared to their Hs578T cells

miRNAs originate from two chromosomes i.e. chromosome
19 (26 miRNAs) and chromosome 14  (25  miRNAs)
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, nine of the ten most substantially
down-regulated are encoded from 14q32.31, with the tenth
miRNA from 14q32.2 (Figure 3B(i) & 3B(ii)). As detailed

2, 3, 4, 5), cytogenetic analysis was performed to establish
if this region of chromosome 14 was deleted. No structural
anomalies at chromosomes 14q32 were observed. However,
qPCR assessment for the neighbouring MEG3 locus showed
significantly reduced MEG3 expression levels in Hs578Ts(i)8
compared to Hs578T cells indicating transcriptional
silencing in this chromosomal region in Hs578Ts(i)8 cells,
reflected in their EV content.

(Suppl. Figure 7A & 7B); however this may be due, at least
partly, to reduced proliferation. miR-134 over-expression
in these Hs578Ts(i)8 cells did not significantly augment
the anti-proliferative effects of the anti-Hsp90 compounds
17-AAG and PU-H71 (Suppl. Figure 7C).
As ectopic miR-134 over-expression in Hs578Ts(i)8
cells was associated with reduced expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, we more extensively analysed the
effect of miR-134 transfection on apoptosis in combination
with cisplatin treatment. First, we determined the effect of
15 μM cisplatin on non-transfected (NT) cells. After 24 h,
flow cytometric analysis showed that 15 μM cisplatin
significantly increased the percentage of Hs578Ts(i)8 total
apoptotic events (early, represented by AnnexinV positive
cells, and late, represented by Annexin V and PI positive
cells) from 4.6% in untreated cells to 40% in cisplatintreated cells (p = 0.0002) (Figure 5D(i) & 5D(ii) & 5E).
24 h following transfection of Hs578Ts(i)8 with
miR-134-mimic or NC-mimic, cells were treated
with 15 μM cisplatin for 24 h. An additional 10 ± 3%
increase (p = 0.017) in apoptosis in response to cisplatin
in miR-134-mimic versus NC-mimic transfected cells
was achieved (Figure 5F(i) & 5F(ii) & Figure 5G), again
in all cells with characteristics of early and late apoptosis.

miR-134 levels are significantly lower in tumour
tissue from patients with breast cancer compared
to matched normal specimens
As miR-134 was most substantially down-regulated
in both Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and EVs compared to their
Hs578T counterparts, prior to exploring its functional
relevance we felt it was important to establish if it may
have relevance in breast cancer rather than being solely
a cell line related observation. For this we mined relevant
publically-available datasets through Gene expression
omnibus. From the GSE40525 and GSE26659 datasets,
miR-134 was found to be significantly down-regulated
in breast cancer (Figure 4A & 4B, respectively) when
compared its levels in healthy breast tissue.

miR-134-enriched EVs released from
miR-134-transfected Hs578Ts(i)8 cells reduce
aggressiveness of secondary cells (apparently
via down-regulation of STAT5B-Hsp90) and
increased sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 drugs

miR-134 over-expression is associated with
STAT5B, Hsp90 and Bcl-2 expression and
increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis
TargetScan predicted miR-134 to target STAT5B
at position 2510–2517 3′UTR [25]. In order to assess
the  functional relevance of miR-134, Hs578Ts(i)8
cells  were directly transfected with a miR-134mimic (or negative control (NC)-mimic). Successful
transfection and miR-134 over-expression was confirmed
by qPCR (Suppl.  Figure 6). Immunoblotting showed
that STAT5B, Hsp90 and Bcl-2 expressions were
significantly  reduced  by  2.2-fold (p = 0.008), 1.5-fold
(p = 0.0001) and 1.6-fold (p = 0.000004), respectively,
following miR-134 transfection (Figure 5A & 5B).
This was associated with reduced aggressiveness of
the Hs578Ts(i)8 cells, evidenced by their reduced
proliferation (2.2-fold; p=0.00004) (Figure 5C).
Migration and invasion were also observed to be reduced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Following analysis of directly transfected miR-134
back into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells, we proceeded to investigate
if EVs from miR-134-transfected Hs578Ts(i)8 would be
enriched with miR-134 and, if so, could they deliver this
miRNA to secondary cells where it could function. Following
RNAse-treatment of the EV isolates to ensure that the
miR-134 considered was internal to the EVs, qPCR analysis
confirmed that EVs expelled from the miR-134-transfected
cells were, indeed, enriched with miR-134 (Figure 6A). As
a consequence of their subsequent addition to secondary
cells (in this case, Hs578Ts(i)8 parent cells as they have
low  endogenous miR-134 levels), STAT5B and Hsp90
protein levels were significantly reduced (1.6-fold, p = 0.005;

2.3-fold, p = 0.04; Figure 6C(i) & 6C(ii), respectively).
Furthermore, a significant reduction of Hs578Ts(i)8 migration
(1.2-fold; p = 0.002; Figure 6D) and invasion (Figure 6E;
1.2-fold; p = 0.009) resulted. Here, unlike directly
transfecting miR-134, the application of miR-134-enriched
EVs did not significantly alter Hs578Ts(i)8 proliferation or
cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Suppl. Figure 8).
As treatment with miR-134-enriched EVs has
the ability to reduce Hsp90 expression levels and did
not  impact on cellular proliferation, we examined if
miR-134-enriched EVs could increase sensitivity to antiHsp90 drugs. Here, miR-134-enriched EVs increased the
sensitivity of Hs578Ts(i)8 cells to their approximate IC50
concentration of 17-AAG and PU-H71; drugs that robust
pre-clinical studies have indicated to possess potential
as anti-cancer treatments in TNBC and thus have been
proposed as relevant drugs to advance to clinical trials in
TNBC [7, 27].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Regarding 17-AAG (Figure 7A), cells treated with
miR-134-enriched EVs showed 4.1-fold reduced growth
(p = 0.0000004) in response to 17-AAG, compared to
cells treated with NC mimic-enriched EVs and no drug.
This is in comparison to 2.8-fold increased toxicity
(p = 0.00000007) with cells treated with NC-mimic EVs
and 70 nM 17-AAG. Comparing the effects of NC-mimic
EVs to miR-134-mimic EVs, the latter produced a 1.5-fold
(p = 0.001) increase in sensitivity to 17-AAG (Figure 7A).
Likewise with PU-H71 (Figure 7B), cells treated
with miR-134-enriched EVs showed 4.5-fold toxicity
(p =0.000004) in response to PU-H71, compared to cells
treated with NC-mimic-enriched EVs and no drug. This is
in comparison to 2.2-fold increase in toxicity (p = 0.000007)
with NC-mimic EVs and PU-H71. Comparing the effects
of miR-134-mimic EVs and NC-mimic EVs, a 2.1-fold
(p = 0.0001) increase in Hs578Ts(i)8 sensitivity to PU-H71
was observed (Figure 7B).

DISCUSSION

“sentinel” MEG3 locus was observed in Hs578Ts(i)8
compared to Hs578T cells, suggesting transcriptional
silencing in this chromosomal region of Hs578Ts(i)8 cells;
which is reflected in their EV content.
miR-134 (from 14q32.31) showed the greatest
level of reduction in the Hs578Ts(i)8-derived EVs. This
suggests that loss, or at least reduced levels, of miR-134
may play an important role in TNBC aggressiveness.
Similar observations to this have recently been reported
in other cancers where miR-134 levels were found to
inversely correlate with the aggression of NSCLC [44]
and osteosarcoma [45]. Additionally, miR-134 exerts antitumour effects in NSCLC, as well as playing a tumour
suppressive role in hepatocellular carcinoma [46].
However, no such observation has been reported in breast
cancer to the best of our knowledge. Strengthening our
observations, our analysis of two independent publicallyavailable datasets demonstrated that miR-134 levels are
significantly reduced in breast cancer tumours compared
to normal control tissue. Similar to other miRNA profiling
studies performed in breast cancer, here we also identified
miR-31 and miR-245 to be down-regulated in our
aggressive TNBC cells and EV variants. Although we did
not find miR-15a, miR-126 and miR-200b to be downregulated in our Hs578Ts(i)8 cells, we identified them to
be present at reduced levels in the corresponding EVs, in
keeping with observations made by others in breast cancer
[18]. Complimenting others [47], we found that miR-200a
is down-regulated in more aggressive breast cancer cells
[47]. However, neither of these studies [18, 47] identified
miR-134 as being reduced in breast cancer.
We, therefore, analysed the functional relevance of
miR-134 in the aggressive TNBC cell line, Hs578Ts(i)8.
We established that directly re-introducing/transfecting
miR-134 back into these cells, from where it has been

Advancing on our previous analysis of exosomes in
relation to TNBC [23], we believe this to be the first study
to profile the miRNA contents of both TNBC derivedEVs and cells to identify miRNAs which may have
therapeutic potential in TNBC and aim to exploit these
EVs as therapeutic miRNA delivery vesicles to reduce
TNBC aggression and increase TNBC drug sensitivity.
Additionally, this is the first report detailing the relevance
of miR-134 in TNBC, as well as its potential as a tumour
suppressor.
Here, we observed that the miRNA contents of EVs
are highly representative of the miRNAs contents of their
cells of origin, an observation made by ourselves and
others in other cancer types including melanoma [28],
ovarian [29], oesophageal [30] and prostate [31] cancers.
Of particular interest to identifying a tumour suppressor
miRNA, we found 83 miRNAs commonly down in both
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and their EVs compared to Hs578T
counterparts. It has been established that human miRNAs
tend to be derived from fragile chromosomal regions
or genomic regions associated with cancer progression
[32]. Notably, the ten most substantially down-regulated
miRNAs in Hs578Ts(i)8 cells/EVs all stem from the
same chromosomal cluster of chromosome 14, 14q32,
which has been identified as a region commonly deleted
in cancer progression [33–38]. Additionally, downregulated miRNAs derived from this cluster have been
suggested to be involved in cancer progression [39–42].
Noncoding genes at this locus, including miR-134 and
the co-regulated MEG3, are physiologically expressed
from the maternal allele [43]. Our cytogenetic analysis
detected no structural anomalies at chromosomes 14q32,
although significantly reduced expression of neighbouring

substantially lost, resulted in significantly reduced levels
of its predicted target protein, STAT5B. Of particular
interest, it has been previously reported that STAT5B
induces the transcription of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone
protein widely expressed in breast cancer [26]. Hsp90 is
implicated in increasing the survival of breast cancer cells
by stabilising oncogenic proteins [48] including Bcl-2, and
if targeted, can allow tumour cells to overcome apoptotic
resistance through Hsp90-Bcl-2 interactions [49]. As
mentioned above, Hsp90 is also a potential therapeutic
target for TNBC [7]. Here its expression was significantly
reduced as a consequence of miR-134 over-expression.
As Bcl-2 expression was also observed to be
decreased upon miR-134 transfection, we initially opted to
investigate miR-134′s potential relevance as an apoptosis
inducer/enhancer. Transfection of Hs578Ts(i)8 cells with
miR-134-mimic in combination with cisplatin treatment
[50] increased cellular sensitivity to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis. This result suggests that miR-134 may have
potential as an onco-suppressor when used in combination
with chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin. This finding
compliments previous observations that miR-195, miR-24–2
and miR-365–2 amplify the apoptotic effect of etoposide in
MCF7 breast cancer cells [51]. Further investigations of the
effects of miR-134 in TNBC aggression led us to analysing
its effects on migration and invasion. Although miR-134
appears to significantly reduce the invasion and migration
of TNBC cells, it apparently does not give substantial
benefit to migration and invasion additional to its effects on
proliferation (which would cause fewer cells to be available
to migrate or invade and thus give the, possibly misleading,
impression of reduced migration and invasion). Furthermore,
combining the direct transfection of miR-134-mimic with
Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG or PU-H71 treatment [7] did
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not significantly amplify the anti-proliferative effects of
17-AAG or PU-H71 on Hs578Ts(i)8 cells. Together, these
results show that directly transfecting miR-134 back into
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells resulted in significantly reduced cellular
growth rate and reduced levels of STAT5B and subsequently
Hsp90, but with no obvious effects on migration/invasion
or response to anti-Hsp90 agents additional to its effects
on growth rate. This direct transfection of miR-134 did,
however, significantly enhance the apoptotic response to
cisplatin.
As EVs are often proposed as having potential
as “self” delivery systems [52, 53] we subsequently
investigated here if EVs could be manipulated as miR-134
delivery vesicles. Here, post-transfection of Hs578Ts(i)8
cells with miR-134, the released miR-134-enriched EVs
resulted in down-regulation of both STAT5B and Hsp90
in recipient (Hs578Ts(i)8) cells and they significantly
increased sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 inhibitors, 17-AAG
and PH-H71. Furthermore, migration and invasion of the
recipient cells was significantly reduced, without effect on
proliferation or cellular response to cisplatin.
Overall, here we showed that the miRNA content
of EVs is highly representative of their cells of origin.
The miRNAs most substantially down-regulated in the
aggressive TNBC cells and their EVs originate from
14q32, a region commonly deleted in cancer progression.
Analysis of miR-134 i.e. the most substantially downregulated miRNA, supported its clinical relevance
in breast tumours. miR-134 was predicted to control
STAT5B expression and our functional studies support
its effects to be, at least partly, via this route. Delivery
of miR-134 into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells substantially changed
their phenotype. Specifically, when delivered directly by
transfection the STAT5B and Hsp90 expression levels

were reduced, but response to anti-Hsp90 drugs was not
augmented. However, cellular growth was reduced and
cisplatin-induced apoptosis was enhanced. Delivery via
miR-134-enriched EVs also reduced STAT5B and Hsp90
expression, had no apparent effects on proliferation,
but cellular migration and invasion were reduced and
sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 drugs was enhanced. While
the phenotypic influences observed are likely to be, at
least  partly, due to the amounts of miR-134 delivered
(~15,000-fold by transfection versus < 2-fold via EVs),
these studies -originating with EV analysis- have identified
miRNA-134 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic for
breast cancer. Future studies aimed at titrating the amount
of miR-134 delivered may help to achieve maximum
benefit. Of course a limitation of this study is that fact
that we only had access to one pair of isogenic TNBC cell
line variants. Expanding this work to a more extensive
analysis of a larger number of cell lines (and their isogenic
variants, if possible) would be ideal and is recommended.
In conclusion, these studies indicate the potential
diagnostic relevance of miR-134 both as a biomarker for
TNBC and as a potential therapeutic option. In addition
to extending these studies to more cell line models and
analysis of independent cohorts of breast tumour and
normal tissue specimens, investigating the prognostic
and predictive nature of miR-134 would be of value. We
propose that such studies could initially include analysis
of specimens procured retrospectively where patients’
response to systemic treatment (e.g. cisplatin and/or
Hsp90 inhibitors) and/or survival outcome is now already
known. Positive results emerging from such analysis could
then be advanced to blinded prospective longitudinal
studies, statistically powered based on the outcome
from the retrospective analysis, where specimens would
be procured prior to any treatment, during the course
of treatment and post-treatment to help determine and
validate the true relevance of miR-134 in TNBC.

described [23].
EVs from miR-134 transfected cells
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells were transfected with miR-134
(as described below) in medium containing EV-depleted
FBS (dFBS) [23] and cultured for 48 h. 10 ml of CM was
collected and treated with 5 μg/ml RNase A (SigmaAldrich) for 30 mins at 37°C, according to a previous study
[22]; centrifuged at 3 000 g for 15 min to remove cellular
debris. EVs were then isolated from the supernatants
using Exoquick (System Biosciences, Mountain View,
CA, USA) and re-suspended in 100 μl of PBS, following
manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described [22].

Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, cell pellets and EVs were
lysed using SDS lysis buffer (250 nM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4;
2.5%  SDS). Proteins (30 μg) were resolved on 12.5%
SDS gels (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked
in 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies to
PDC6I/Alix (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), TSG101
(1:1000; Abcam), CD63 (1:500; Abcam), STAT5B (1:500;
Cell Signalling, Danvers, MA, USA), total Hsp90 (1:1000;
StressMarq, Victoria, Canada), Bcl-2 (1:500; Calbiochem,
San Diego, USA) or β-Actin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich).
Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Blots were developed as we previously
described [23].

Transmission electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
approximately 10 μl aliquot of EVs were examined at
100 kV using a JEOL JEM-2100 TEM (JOEL, Peabody,
USA), as we previously described [23].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNA isolation

Cell culture

Total RNA was isolated from cells and EVs using
the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands)
following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was
quantified by Nanodrop-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington USA).

Hs578T (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), a TNBC
cell line, and its isogenic sub-clone Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
(gift from Dr. Linda Hughes and Dr. Susan McDonnell
[24]) were cultured at 37oC/5% CO2 in DMEM (SigmaAldrich, St.  Louis, MO, USA)), 10% FBS (PAA,
Pasching, Austria), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 10 μg/ml of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell line
authentication is described in the Supplementary Material.

miRNA profiling
miRNA profiling (384 miRNAs) was performed
on biological triplicates of Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
and their derived EVs using TaqMan Low-Density Assays
(TLDA). qPCR reactions were performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Briefly, 20 ng of RNA was reverse
transcribed using TaqMan miRNA RT Kit in combination

with the Megaplex primers pool set A. The resulting cDNA
was pre-amplified using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix
and Megaplex PreAmp primers. TLDAs were run using a
ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Systems). Cycle
threshold values were calculated using SDS software.
CT  values ≥35 were considered as undetected [54].
Relative quantities of miRNAs were calculated using the
2−ΔΔCT method after normalisation to RNU48 as control,
which was established as unchanged between Hs578T and
Hs578Ts(i)8 cell and EV samples. A ≥2-fold change and
p < 0.05 were cut-offs for determining if a miRNA was
comparatively up- or down-regulated.

complete medium. 5 μl of lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) per well was diluted in 250 μl
Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). miRNA-mimics were
diluted in 250 μl Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min. The
lipofectamine/Opti-MEM mixture was subsequently mixed
with the miRNA/Opti-MEM mixture and incubated for
20 min at room temperature. This was subsequently added
to the cells and allowed to transfect for 4 h at 37°C/5% CO2.
Medium was then removed and cells were gently washed
twice with base medium and fed with complete medium.

qPCR

With direct miR-134 transfection

In order to validate key findings from the
miRNA  profiling, qPCR was performed for specific
miRNAs of  interest. All TaqMan miRNA assays
used  (miR-134: ID:001186; miR-370: ID:002275;
miR-655: ID:001612;  miR-376c: ID: 002122; miR889: ID:002202 and miR-146b-3p: ID:002361) were from
Applied Biosystems. cDNA synthesis was performed
using TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription assays
kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, reverse transcriptions were performed
on biological triplicates, using 10 ng total RNA and qPCR
was subsequently performed using TaqMan microRNA
assay kit (Applied Biosystems) using 1.33 μl of cDNA
from reverse transcription. Relative quantities of miRNA
were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method for cells and EVs
after normalisation to RNU48.

Proliferation analysis was initiated 48 h post
transfection of cells and cultured for 48 h before analysing
growth. Specifically, transfected Hs578Ts(i)8 cells (with miR134-mimic or NC-mimic) were seeded at 2 × 103 cells/well
in a 96-well plate and cultured for 48 h, when growth was
assessed using the acid phosphatase assay [58].
With miR-134-enriched EVs
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells were seeded at a density of
2 ×  103 cells/well in a 96-well plate in the presence
of 2  μg of EVs from miR-134-mimic or NC-mimic
transfected cells. After 48 h, growth was assessed using
acid phosphatase51.

Effect of miR-134 on cisplatin-induced apoptosis
With direct miR-134 transfection

miR-134 in breast tumour and normal
tissue specimens

To analyse the effects of miR-134 on apoptosis
induction, cells were transfected with miR-134-mimic or
NC-mimic and, 24 h later, transfected cells were treated
with 15 μM cisplatin for a further 24 h. CM was then
collected and cells were trypsinised and pelleted. CM
was used to neutralise trypsin and to collect any apoptotic
cells which may be present in the CM. Cell pellets were
re-suspended in 2 ml 1X binding buffer (BB) (0.1 M
HEPES, 1.4 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), centrifuged
at 200 g and supernatant discarded and resuspended in
30 μl of BB solution. 20 μl of cell suspension, 5 μl of
Annexin-V-allophycocyanin (APC) (BD Biosciences)
and 5 μl of propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (BD
Biosciences) were mixed. 70 μl of 1X BB was added and
incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 mins.
400 μl of 1X BB solution was subsequently added and
mixed by pipetting. Levels of apoptosis was analysed on
2 × 104 cells using a BD Accuri™-C6 flow cytometer.

miR-134 levels in breast tumours and matched
normal breast tissue were determined using two publicallyavailable tumour datasets by Gene expression omnibus
(GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Specifically
GEO accession GSE26659 [55] is comprised of a total
of 77 breast tumour specimens obtained from patients
who underwent primary surgical treatment and 17 normal
breast tissue specimens obtained from mammoplastic
reductions. GEO accession GSE40525 [56] consists of
breast tumour specimens (n = 61) with 56 control tissues
obtained from matched adjacent peri-tumoural normal
breast tissues. miRNA expression values were determined
using GEO2R [57].

Transfection of miR-134 into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells were transfected with miR-134mimic (4464066; Applied Biosystems) or NC-mimic
(4464058; Applied Biosystems) at a  final concentration
of 30  nM, as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/well (6-well
plate). The following day, medium was replaced with fresh

15 μM of cisplatin and re-treated with 5 μg of the same
EVs. 24 h later, cells were analysed for apoptosis as
above.

To investigate the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on
Hs578Ts(i)8 cells following exposure to miR-134-mimic
EVs or NC-mimic EVs, Hs578Ts(i)8 cells were seeded
at 2 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The following
day,  EVs (2 μg) derived from miR-134-mimic or
NC-mimic-transfected cells were added with 17-AAG or
PU-H71 drugs and analysed as above [58].

Migration and invasion following miR-134
re-introduction into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells
With direct miR-134 transfection
Migration and invasion assays were performed
as we previously described [23, 59]. 48 h posttransfection of Hs578Ts(i)8 cells with miR-134-mimic.
Briefly, medium (500 μl) containing 10% dFBS was
added to each well, below the insert. 2.5 × 104 cells
in 500 μl complete medium were added to each insert
(for migration assay, cells were seeded on a noncoated transwell chamber, whereas for invasion, cells
were seeded on an ECM-coated transwell chamber).
Five  hours later, when cells had attached, medium
within the inserts was replaced with medium containing
only 1% FBS. After allowing 48 h for migration, cells
were stained and evaluated [23].

Statistical and bioinformatics analysis
Online miRNA target prediction software
(TargetScan Human Release 6.2) predicted protein
targets regulated by miR-134. Chromosomal origins
of miRNAs were identified using miRBase. Statistical
analysis was performed in Excel. P-values were
generated using Student’s t-tests, with p < 0.05
considered significant. GraphPad Prism 5.0 was
used for graph generation (GraphPad Software Inc,
La Jolla,  USA).

for invasion and allowed to attach for 5 h in complete
medium. This was then replaced with DMEM including
1% FBS and 10 μg (migration) or 15 μg (invasion) of
miR-134-mimic or NC-mimic EVs were added. Cells were
cultured for 48 h and analysed as above.
