Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs are essential in promoting breast cancer
invasion, systemic dissemination, and in arousing proliferative programs in breast cancer
micrometastases, a reaction that is partially dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Many
functions of FAK are shared by its homologue, Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Pyk2), raising the
question as to whether Pyk2 also participates in driving the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated
breast cancer cells. In addressing this question, we observed Pyk2 expression to be (i) significantly
upregulated in recurrent human breast cancers; (ii) differentially expressed across clonal isolates
of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a manner predictive for metastatic outgrowth, but
not for invasiveness; and (iii) dramatically elevated in ex vivo cultures of breast cancer cells
isolated from metastatic lesions as compared to cells that produced the primary tumor. We further
show that metastatic human and murine breast cancer cells robustly upregulate their expression of
Pyk2 during EMT programs stimulated by TGF-β. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Pyk2
demonstrated that the activity of this protein tyrosine kinase was dispensable for the ability of
breast cancer cells to undergo invasion in response to TGF-β, and to form orthotopic mammary
tumors in mice. In stark contrast, Pyk2-deficiency prevented TGF-β from stimulating the growth
of breast cancer cells in 3D-organotypic cultures that recapitulated pulmonary microenvironments,
as well as inhibited the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells in the lungs of
mice. Mechanistically, Pyk2 expression was directly and inversely related to that of E-cadherin,
such that elevated Pyk2 levels stabilized β1 integrin expression necessary to initiate the metastatic
outgrowth of breast cancer cells. Thus, we have delineated novel functions for Pyk2 in mediating
distinct elements of the EMT program and metastatic cascade regulated by TGF-β, particularly the
initiation of secondary tumor outgrowth by disseminated cells.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and its induction of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) are essential mediators underlying the acquisition of invasive and
metastatic phenotypes in breast cancers. Recent findings have begun to delineate the
molecular mechanisms whereby EMT programs are stimulated by TGF-β, which targets a
variety of transcription factors and microRNAs that collectively induce polarized epithelial
cells to acquire apolar mesenchymal-like characteristics (1, 2). Along these lines, we
recently established the essential function of integrins and focal adhesion complexes in
mediating oncogenic TGF-β signaling and its coupling to EMT programs (see (1, 2)).
Indeed, formation of TβR-II:β3 integrin complexes amplifies the transduction through a
Src:FAK:Grb2:p38 MAPK signaling axis coupled to the initiation of EMT and metastasis in
breast cancers (see (1, 2)). Despite these recent advances, science and medicine still know
very little as to how the progression through and eventual emergence from an EMT program
impacts the flux through cellular signaling systems. Two recent studies by our group have
attempted to address this question and demonstrated that breast cancer cells that have
undergone EMT possess a selective advantage to (i) escape the confines of the primary
tumor via an EGF-dependent mechanism (3), and (ii) circumvent the inhibitory actions of Ecadherin (E-cad) in suppressing β1 integrin expression necessary to reinitiate proliferative
programs and metastatic outgrowth (4). Collectively, these findings provided novel insights
into the functions of TGF-β and EMT in supporting late events of the metastatic cascade;
however, the identity and relative contribution of specific TGF-β effectors in mediating
these events remains to be fully elucidated.

Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Pyk2; also known as CAKB, FAK2, CADTK, FADK2, or
RAFTK) is a homologue of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and shares an overall amino acid
identity of 46%, which increases to 60% within the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain
(5, 6). Despite their structural similarities, FAK and Pyk2 exhibit important functional
differences. For instance, FAK expression is ubiquitous, essential for life, and localizes
primarily to focal adhesion complexes where it is activated by integrins and growth factor
receptors. In stark contrast, the expression of Pyk2 is highly restricted, dispensable for life,
and localizes primarily to the cytoplasm where it is activated by chemokines and G proteincoupled receptors (7–11). Although both PTKs are known to regulate cell migration and
invasion in a compensatory manner (12–15), the differences existing in their tissue
distribution, subcellular localization, and necessity for survival indicate that FAK and Pyk2
play unique roles in regulating cell and tissue homeostasis (9, 16, 17). With respect to breast
cancers, we (18) and others (19–22) have identified FAK as a key player operant in coupling
TGF-β to EMT, invasive, and metastatic behaviors. However, the expression and activity of
Pyk2 has also been implicated in regulating the production and expansion of breast cancer
stem cells (13), as well as in promoting the motility and survival of breast cancer cells (13,
23, 24). Herein, we identify Pyk2 as novel EMT biomarker and found its expression to be
robustly upregulated by TGF-β in transdifferentiating breast cancer cells. Thus, the objective
of this study was to determine the mechanism whereby Pyk2 contributes to breast cancer
metastasis.

Results
Pyk2 expression is elevated in aggressive breast cancers
Although elevations in the expression and activity of FAK are clearly associated with breast
cancer progression and metastasis (18–22), a similar understanding related to the function of
Pyk2 during mammary tumorigenesis remains to be elucidated. As such, we performed
Oncomine 4.4 analyses and observed Pyk2 expression to be significantly upregulated in HRas-transformed mammary epithelial cells (MECs), and in invasive human breast

carcinomas, particularly those that exhibited recurrence (Table 1). Moreover, Pyk2
expression was significantly reduced in human MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) metastatic breast
cancer cells engineered to lack expression of Coco (25), a bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) antagonist (GSE28049; Table 1). BMP and TGF-β signaling typically oppose one
another, particularly during the induction of EMT programs (4). Therefore, this finding
suggests that expression of Pyk2 may reflect the overall balance of signaling inputs
originating from TGF-β and BMP.

Along these lines, we monitored Pyk2 expression levels in parental and clonal cell
populations of MDA-231 cells (Figure 1a), which were established from a pleural effusion
and represent a heterogeneous mixture of aggressive and nonaggressive carcinoma cells
(26). Interestingly, while FAK expression was equivalent across all MDA-231 clonal
populations, we observed Pyk2 expression to be highly variable and dissociated from the
differential invasiveness exhibited by these clonal populations (Figures 1a and b). However,
Pyk2 expression was positively associated with the competency of MDA-231 cells to thrive
in 3D-organotypic cultures that mimicked the pulmonary microenvironment. Indeed, Figure
1c shows that Pyk2-positive CP2-MDA-231 cells grew robustly in 3D–cultures, while Pyk2deficient CP4-MDA-231 cells grew poorly and displayed loosely packed and branched
organoid structures that we previously linked to the development of metastatic dormancy
(Figure 1d; (3, 4)). It should be noted that FAK activation has also been implicated as a
mediator of metastatic outgrowth (27). Thus, to gauge the extent to which FAK or Pyk2
activity drives the outgrowth of metastatic breast cancer cells, we compared the activities of
two related FAK and Pyk2 antagonists, PF562271 (PF-271) and PF573228 (PF-228).
Importantly, while PF-271 and PF-228 are equivalent in their ability to inhibit FAK (IC50 of
1.5 and 4 nM, respectively), these compounds differ significantly in their ability to inhibit
Pyk2 (IC50 of 14 and 1000 nM, respectively; (28, 29)). Administration of the dual FAK/
Pyk2 inhibitor, PF-271, was significantly more effective at inhibiting the 3D–outgrowth of
CP2-MDA-231 cells as compared to equivalent concentrations of the FAK-specific
inhibitor, PF-228 (Figures 1d and e). Collectively, these findings implicate elevated Pyk2
expression and activity as a potential mediator of metastatic outgrowth by breast cancer
cells.
TGF-β induces Pyk2 expression via Smad4- and Src-dependent pathways

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the strong correlation between elevated Pyk2 expression and breast cancer
progression (Table 1 and Figure 1), we next sought to determine whether and how TGF-β
coupled to Pyk2 in metastatic breast cancers. Figure 2a shows that TGF-β readily induced
Pyk2 expression in MDA-231 cells propagated in traditional 2D cultures, and that the
magnitude of Pyk2 expression was potentiated by propagating MDA-231 cells in compliant
3D-organotypic cultures. Likewise, we also observed Pyk2 expression to increase as a
function of the metastatic ability of derivatives belonging to the murine 4T1 breast cancer
progression series (Supplementary Figure 1a; (30)). Indeed, the tonic levels of Pyk2 mRNA
and protein were significantly higher in 4T1 cells as compared to their less aggressive 4T07
counterparts (Figures 2b and c). Moreover, both cell lines rapidly and dramatically
upregulated their synthesis of Pyk2 transcripts and protein when stimulated by TGF-β
(Figures 2b and c). Importantly, increases in Pyk2 expression were paralleled by elevations
in its phosphorylation status (Supplementary Figure 1b). Furthermore, administration of
TβR-I or Src inhibitors to 4T1 cells suppressed their expression of Pyk2, thereby implicating
autocrine TGF-β signaling and its activation of Src (31–33) as drivers of elevated Pyk2
expression in metastatic breast cancer cells (Figure 2d). It is interesting to note that TGF-β
failed to upregulate Pyk2 expression in nonmetastatic and dormant human MCF-7 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1c), but readily did so in our recently established model of EGFRmediated transformation and EMT-driven metastatic progression of normal murine

mammary gland cells (NMuMG) cells (Supplementary Figure 1d; (3, 4)). Collectively, these
findings suggest that the extent to which TGF-β induces Pyk2 expression is directly
proportional to the metastatic potential of individual breast cancer cells.
Recent studies have linked chemotherapeutic resistance to the ability of these drugs to elicit
an EMT reaction (34–37). Along these lines, we too found that chronic treatment of 4T07
cells with PF-228 resulted in the generation and expansion of chemoresistant 4T07 cells that
displayed an overt EMT phenotype (Supplementary Figure 2a), while similar chronic
treatment with PF-271 failed to yield chemoresistance cells capable of thriving in culture
(data not shown). However, upregulated Pyk2 expression was not associated with
chemotherapy-induced EMT reactions (Supplementary Figure 2b). Similarly,
overexpression of the EMT-associated transcription factors Twist or Snail in 4T07 cells had
little affect on their expression of Pyk2 in the absence or presence of TGF-β (Supplementary
Figure 2c). Taken together, these data suggest that Pyk2 may represent a novel and specific
target of TGF-β-induced EMT.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we sought to delineate the mechanisms whereby TGF-β stimulates the expression of
Pyk2. Supplementary Figure 2d shows that the ability of TGF-β to induce Pyk2 expression
was blocked by treating 4T07 cells with inhibitors against TβR-I (i.e., SB431542 or TβR-I
inhibitor II) or Src (i.e., PP2), but not by treating these cells with inhibitors against a variety
of noncanonical TGF-β effector molecules, including MEK1/2, MAP kinases (p38 MAPK
and JNK), AKT1/2, STAT3, MLCK, c-Abl, PI3K, IKK, Rho kinase, GSK3β, or Cox2
(Supplemental Figure 2d). Additionally, the oncogenic activities of TGF-β are aided through
its ability to cross-talk with a variety of chemokine and growth factor receptors (1, 2);
however, pharmacology inactivation of the receptors for FGF, IGF, EGF, and PGE2 failed
to significantly alter the coupling of TGF-β to Pyk2 expression in 4T07 cells
(Supplementary Figures 2d). However, activation of Smad2/3 by TGF-β was abrogated
upon propagating the cells in mechanically compliant 3D-organotypic cultures (Figure 2e
and Supplementary Figure 3a), an experimental condition that elicited Pyk2 expression
independent of TGF-β signaling (Figure 2a). Moreover, inhibiting the activation of Src not
only decreased the ability of TGF-β to induce Pyk2 expression, but also diminished its
ability to induce the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (Supplementary Figures 2d and
Supplementary Figure 3b), suggesting a role of Smad2/3/4 signaling in coupling TGF-β to
Pyk2 expression. Accordingly, shRNA-mediated depletion of Smad4 abrogated the coupling
of TGF-β to Pyk2 expression (Figure 2f). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the
importance of autocrine and paracrine TGF-β signaling to govern Pyk2 expression via the
combined actions of a Smad4 and Src signaling axis.

Pyk2 expression is essential for pulmonary tumor formation in mice
Our aforementioned findings suggest that Pyk2 may play a critical role in facilitating breast
cancer metastasis. Therefore, we depleted Pyk2 expression in highly metastatic 4T1 cells,
which then were engrafted onto the mammary fat pads of Balb/C mice (Figure 3a). Although
Pyk2-deficiency failed to affect the growth and latency of primary 4T1 tumors (Figure 3b),
this same cellular condition did significantly impair the extent and size to which
disseminated 4T1 cells formed macroscopic pulmonary metastases (Figures 3c and d).
We also examined the necessity of Pyk2 in regulating the metastatic ability of 4T07 cells,
which dramatically upregulate their expression of this PTK in response to TGF-β (Figure 2).
Although 4T07 cells are capable of forming and exiting a primary orthotopic tumor and
being readily detected in the circulatory system of mice, these cells cannot establish
proliferating secondary tumors at disseminated organ sites (3, 30). However, when injected
into the lateral tail of Balb/C mice, 4T07 cells exhibited widespread dissemination and
aggressive colonization of multiple tissues, including the brain (data not shown), lung, and

various skeletal sites (Figure 4a; Supplementary Figure 4a). Importantly, Pyk2 expression
was uniformly upregulated in ex vivo cultures of 4T07 metastases as compared their
parental counterparts (Figures 4b; Supplementary Figure 4b). Moreover, rendering 4T07
cells deficient in Pyk2 expression (Supplementary Figure 4b) elicited a significant reduction
in the growth of secondary tumor lesions in the lung and other organ sites (Figures 4c and
d), as well as greatly extended the overall survival of tumor bearing mice (Figure 4e). Thus,
Pyk2 expression and activity function to mediate 4T1 pulmonary metastases.
Pyk2 expression is dispensable for breast cancer cell invasion stimulated by TGF-β

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next sought to establish the specific role played by Pyk2 during breast cancer metastasis
stimulated by TGF-β. Figure 5a shows that TGF-β treatment of 4T07 cells resulted in a
robust rearrangement of the actin cytoskeletal system. Interestingly, administration of
PF-228 (FAK) or PF-271 (FAK/Pyk2) both elicited the accumulation of filopodia and
formation of actin stress fibers in a TGF-β-independent manner (Figure 5a). However,
despite the morphological similarities observed in these static photomicrographs, time-lapse
microscopy showed that administration of PF-228 inhibited the motility of 4T07 cells by
preventing their ability to turnover focal adhesion complexes (Supplementary Movie 1–3;
(29, 38, 39)). In stark contrast, we observed EMT induced by TGF-β to significantly
enhance the invasion (Figure 5b) and migration (Supplementary Movie 2) of 4T07 cells.
Interestingly, pharmacologic inhibition of FAK (PF-228) or FAK/Pyk2 (PF-271) similarly
prevented 4T07 cells from acquiring invasive phenotypes in response to TGF-β (Figure 5b),
an event reminiscent of the failure of TGF-β to induce the invasion of FAK-deficient breast
cancer cells (18). Collectively, these findings suggest that FAK, but not Pyk2, is responsible
for coupling TGF-β to breast cancer cell invasion, and as such, predict that targeted
inactivation of Pyk2 would be ineffective in altering breast cancer cell invasion stimulated
by TGF-β. To test this hypothesis, we utilized two-independent shRNAs to deplete the
expression of Pyk2 in 4T07 cells, whose invasive response to TGF-β was indistinguishable
from that displayed by their parental counterparts (Figure 5c). Collectively, these findings
demonstrate that Pyk2 expression is dispensable for TGF-β stimulation of breast cancer
invasion, a process dependent upon FAK-mediated turnover of focal adhesion complexes
(Supplementary Movies 1–3; (18)).
Upregulated Pyk2 expression couples EMT to metastatic outgrowth stimulated by TGF-β

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We recently showed that EMT can circumvent breast cancer dormancy and initiate
proliferative programs operant in mediating metastatic outgrowth (4). This scenario is
reminiscent of the ability of Pyk2 to enable disseminated breast cancer cells to form
macroscopic secondary tumors in the lungs and other tissues in mice (Figures 3 and 4).
Given these parallels, we sought to address the hypothesis that upregulated Pyk2 expression
is encompassed in an EMT signature operant in driving metastatic outgrowth. Figure 6a
shows that TGF-β stimulation of EMT (Post-EMT) significantly increased the outgrowth of
4T07 cells in pulmonary 3D-organotypic cultures (4, 27, 40, 41). Dual inactivation of FAK
and Pyk2 by administration of PF-271 was more effective in diminishing TGF-β-mediated
4T07 outgrowth as compared to singular inactivation of FAK by PF-228 (Figure 6a). In light
of the dramatic increase in Pyk2 expression observed in Post-EMT 4T07 cells (Figure 2),
this finding suggests that the significantly greater effectiveness of PF-271 to inhibit 4T07
organoid outgrowth relative to that mediated by PF-228 likely reflects the preferential
targeting of PF-271 to inactivate the upregulated pool of Pyk2 in Post-EMT cells.
Accordingly, while Pyk2-deficiency did not alter the 2D morphology of the 4T07 cells, this
cellular condition did (i) dramatically enhance their formation of branched organoids in 3D–
cultures (Supplementary Figures 5a and Figure 6b), a phenotype we have previously
associated with mammary gland differentiation and metastatic dormancy (3, 4); and (ii)
significantly impair their growth in 3D–cultures in response to TGF-β (Figure 6c). Finally,

we observed TGF-β stimulation of EMT to bestow 4T07 cells with a dramatic outgrowth
advantage in the lungs of mice, a reaction that was absolutely dependent upon Pyk2
expression (Figures 6d and e). Taken together, our findings clearly establish the importance
of upregulated Pyk2 expression in coupling oncogenic TGF-β signaling to the metastatic
outgrowth of breast cancer cells.
Pyk2 is required for TGF-β stimulation of an outgrowth proficient phenotype

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next sought to determine the relationship of Pyk2 in coordinating the mutually exclusive
expression patterns exhibited by E-cad and β1 integrin in outgrowth-incompetent (e.g., Ecad high, β1 integrin low) or -proficient (e.g., E-cad low, β1 integrin high) breast cancer
cells (4). In doing so, we observed Pyk2-deficiency in 4T07 cells to elicit a dramatic
upregulation in E-cad expression and prevent TGF-β from inducing that of β1 integrin
(Figure 7a). Despite their elevated basal expression of E-cad, Pyk2-deficient 4T07 cells
remained competent to downregulate E-cad expression (Figure 7a) and stimulate Smad2/3
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 5b) in response to TGF-β. Thus, unlike FAK (18),
Pyk2 expression appeared dispensable for general TGF-β signaling, but was essential in
coupling TGF-β to β1 integrin expression in outgrowth proficient breast cancer cells.
Accordingly, ectopic expression of wild-type E-cad, but not that of a dominant-negative
mutant lacking its extracellular domain (ΔE-Ecad; (42, 43)), prevented TGF-β from
inducing Pyk2 expression in a manner that correlated with the ability of wild-type E-cad to
repress the expression of β1 integrin in metastatic D2.A1 breast cancer cells (Figure 7b; (4)).
Moreover, when propagated in 3D-organotypic cultures, 4T07 cells simultaneously
downregulated their expression of E-cad and upregulated that of Pyk2 (Figure 7c; (4)).
Importantly, the ability of Pyk2-deficient 4T07 cells to maintain E-cad expression
destabilized β1 integrin expression under pulmonary growth conditions (Figure 7c), an event
that we (4) and others (27, 41) have shown to prevent the initiation of metastatic outgrowth.
Accordingly, β1 integrin-deficiency elicited an upregulation of E-cad expression that
abrogated the ability of TGF-β to induce Pyk2 expression (Figure 7d). Taken together, these
findings highlight the dynamic events required for TGF-β and EMT to initiate the
pulmonary outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells, a process culminating in
diminished E-cad expression, upregulated Pyk2 expression, and stabilized β1 integrin
expression (Figure 8).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The switch in TGF-β function from that of a tumor suppressor to a promoter of metastasis is
largely thought to reflect the processes associated with EMT. Indeed, EMT elicits the
physical interaction of TGF-β receptors with integrins (31, 33), growth factor receptors (3),
and molecules housed within focal adhesion complexes, including FAK and p130Cas (18,
44). Collectively, these events coalesce in amplifying the invasive potential of breast cancer
cells via stimulation several different signaling pathways, including p38 MAPK, NF-κB,
and Cox-2 (see (2, 45)). Indeed, based on structural similarities that exist between FAK and
Pyk2 (5, 6), we anticipated Pyk2 to play an essential function in driving breast cancer cell
invasion stimulated by TGF-β. However, disrupting Pyk2 activity through pharmacologic or
genetic means failed to alter TGF-β signaling and its stimulation of breast cancer cell
invasion, events that are clearly reliant upon FAK (Figure 5; (18)). Instead, we defined a
novel positive-feedback loop that enables TGF-β to overcome systemic dormancy and
initiate the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells by simultaneously
regulating the expression of E-cad, Pyk2, and β1 integrin (Figure 8).
Pyk2 expression was variably across clonal populations of human MDA-231 breast cancer
cells. Moreover, the level of Pyk2 expression directly correlated with the ability of these
cells to thrive in pulmonary 3D-organotypic cultures, but not with their ability to invade

through Matrigel (Figure 1). Accordingly, we observed Pyk2 expression to be selectively
and specifically upregulated in ex vivo cultures of macroscopic breast cancer metastases
(Figure 2). Moreover, TGF-β-induced EMT significantly enhanced the production of
pulmonary tumors, an event that was lacking in Pyk2-deficient cells. Mechanistically, the
ability of TGF-β to induce Pyk2 transpires through both Smad4-dependent and -independent
pathways. For instance, we previously observed Smad3/4-based signaling to be robust in
primary mammary tumors and greatly diminished in their resultant pulmonary metastases
(46). Our current findings indicate that the differential activation of Smad3/4 by TGF-β is
due in part to alterations in tissue compliance, such that Smads are strongly stimulated in
biomechanically rigid microenvironments and weakly stimulated in their biomechanically
compliant counterparts. Thus, our findings imply that metastatic breast cancers must
upregulate expression of Pyk2 prior to exiting the rigid primary tumor and subsequent
blunting of their capacity to activate Smad3/4 upon seeding within the compliant pulmonary
microenvironment. As such, it is tempting to speculate that Pyk2 directs an intricate Smadbased EMT program that must be fully operational at the time of metastatic dissemination to
avoid succumbing to pulmonary dormancy. Finally, it is important to note that these Pyk2and EMT-dependent events operant in initiating pulmonary outgrowth must ultimately give
way to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), which is required to sustain macroscopic
outgrowth of breast metastases (4, 47).

Our findings clearly link Smad4 to increased Pyk2 expression stimulated by TGF-β (Figure
2); however, the simple activation of Smad4 by TGF-β was insufficient to universally
elevate Pyk2 levels in all breast cancer cells, particularly those that possess low-grade and
nonmetastatic phenotypes (e.g., MCF-7 and 67NR cells; Supplementary Figure 1). For
instance, we previously observed metastatic 4T1 cells to poorly activate Smad3/4 as
compared to their weakly tumorigenic 67NR counterparts (44), which failed to elevate Pyk2
expression in response to TGF-β (Supplementary Figure 1). Likewise, re-expression of
Smad4 in Smad4-null MDA-MB-468 cells also failed to couple TGF-β to the expression of
Pyk2 (data not shown). These findings suggest that metastatic breast cancer cells selectively
express additional Smad4 transcriptional regulators and/or activate alternative effector
pathways required to mediate TGF-β stimulation of Pyk2 expression. We previously
established Src as an essential player in mediating the oncogenic activities of TGF-β and its
stimulation of breast cancer EMT and metastasis (18, 48). Along these lines, we show herein
that pharmacological inactivation of Src not only decreased the coupling of TGF-β to Pyk2
expression, but also its stimulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, thereby potentially
implicating Src as an upstream effector operant in coupling TGF-β to the activation of
Smads and Pyk2. However, at present, we cannot discount a direct inhibitory effect of PP2
on the activity of TGF-β receptors (49). Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that Smad4 and
Src are both essential in mediating the metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone (50, 51),
which provides a biomechanically rigid microenvironment capable of supporting strong
Smad-dependent signaling (52). Collectively, these studies and the findings presented herein
implicate Pyk2 as an important mediator of breast cancer metastasis, particularly their ability
to reinitiate proliferative programs at sites of secondary tumor formation.
Our conclusion that Pyk2 and E-cad expression are directly related is supported by a recent
study that observed overexpression of Pyk2 to elicit the downregulation of E-cad (14). We
show herein that TGF-β controls these interdependent activities, events that coalesce in the
stabilization of β1 integrin and production of an outgrowth proficient phenotype (Figure 8;
(4)). Precisely how these effectors reinitiate proliferative programs in disseminated breast
cancer cells remains incompletely understood. However, FAK (53) and Pyk2 (54) have been
detected in the nucleus of malignant cells where they promote Mdm2-mediated
ubiquitination and degradation of p53, thereby facilitating enhanced cell proliferation and
survival. In response to TGF-β administration, we recently detected both the full-length and

FERM domains of Pyk2 and FAK in the nuclei of several human and murine triple-negative
breast cancer cell lines (data not shown). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the activation
of β1 integrin promotes the outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells via a p53 pathway
that relies in part on nuclear localization of Pyk2. Future studies are currently underway to
address these questions, and to determine the extent to which cytoplasmic and nuclear Pyk2
drive metastatic progression stimulated by TGF-β.

Murine D2-HAN (D2.OR and D2.A1) and 4T1 derivatives (67NR, 168FARN, 4T07,
66cl14, and 4T1) cells were obtained from Dr. Fred Miller (Wayne State University, Detroit,
MI, USA), while human MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas,
VA, USA). All human and murine breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep as described previously (3). Bioluminescent
4T07 and MDA-MB-231 cells were engineered to stably express firefly luciferase as
described (3, 18). Dual-bioluminescent SBE-reporter cells were generated by stably
transfecting 4T1 cells with pcDNA3.1-Hygro (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) that
constitutively-expressed renilla luciferase under control of the CMV promoter. Afterward,
the resulting hygromycin-resistant 4T1 cell populations were stably transfected with
pGL4.20-Puro (Promega) that expressed firefly luciferase under control of the synthetic
SBE (4xSmad-binding element) promoter. Clonal MDA-MB-231 cell populations CP1–3
were constructed by transfection with pNifty-CMV-luciferase and clonal isolation under
antibiotic selection, while CP4–6 (SCP2–4) were kindly provide by the lab of Dr. Joan
Massague (55). MDA-231-SCP-2 cells that lacked Smad4 were previously described (50).
Cellular depletion of β1 integrin and Pyk2 expression was achieved by VSVG lentiviral
transduction of pLKO.1 shRNA vectors (Open Biosystems, Supplementary Table 1) as
described (4, 18). Ectopic expression of wild-type or a dominant-negative E-cad mutant
lacking its extracellular domain (ΔE-Ecad; (42, 43)) was accomplished as described (4).
Finally, time-lapse microscopy was performed using a Leica DMI6000 over a span of 24 h
with the resulting images being captured once every 10 min.

tail vein of 4- (Figure 3) or 14- (Figure 5) week old Balb/C mice. Alternatively, parental and
Pyk2-deficient 4T1 cells (1×104 cells) were engrafted onto the mammary fat pad of 4-week
old Balb/C mice. All bioluminescent images were captured on a Xenogen IVIS-200 (Caliper
Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA), and pulmonary tumor development was assessed by
weekly bioluminescent imaging on a Xenogen IVIS-200 (Caliper Life Sciences) as
described (3, 18, 44). Upon completion of these studies, the mice were euthanized and their
metastases were rapidly resected, enzymatically dissociated, and immediately subcultured ex
vivo in Zeocin-containing media for 5–7 days, at which point the cells were collected and
prepared for immunoblot analysis. Where indicated, metastatic 4T1 lung nodules were
quantified by three individuals who were blinded to experimental conditions. All animal
procedures were performed in accordance to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee for Case Western Reserve University.
Immunoblot assays
Lysates generated from 2D- and 3D–cultures were prepared as described previously (4).
Antibodies used herein are described in the Supplementary Table 2.

3D-organotypic growth assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human and murine breast cancer were diluted in complete media supplemented with 5%
Cultrex (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and seeded onto solidified Cultrex cushions (50
µl/well) contained in 96-well plates (1×104 cells/cm2). Longitudinal bioluminescent growth
assays were performed as described (3, 4). Pharmacological inhibitors used herein are
described in the Supplementary Table 3.
Cell biological assays
The ability of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) to alter serum-induced invasion of MDA-231 and 4T07
cells was analyzed using a Matrigel-coated transwell assay as described (31). For real-time
PCR analysis, 4T07 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for varying lengths of
time, at which point total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen). Afterward,
total RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis System (BioRad), and
semi-quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using iQ SYBR Green (BioRad) as
described previously (18). The oligonucleotide primer pairs used are provided in
Supplementary Table 1. Lastly, direct phalloidin-fluorescence to visualize the actin
cytoskeleton was accomplished as described previously (18, 44).
Statistical analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Statistical values were defined using an unpaired Student’s T-test, where a P value < 0.05
was considered significant. Statistically significant difference in the overall survival of mice
bearing parental or Pyk2-deficient 4T07 tumors was analyzed using a Log-Rank Test. P
values for all experiments are indicated.

TGF-β induces Pyk2 expression via Src and Smad4 signaling. (a) Human MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells were propagated in traditional 2D–cultures (2D) or 3D-organotypic
cultures (3D) for 5 days in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) as indicated.
Afterward, differences in the expression levels of Pyk2 and FAK were monitored by
immunoblotting. The N-terminally-directed FAK antibody also readily detected the
accumulation of the FAK FERM domain as shown. β-actin served as a loading control. (b
and c) 4T07 and 4T1 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) over a span of 48 h as
indicated. Afterward, changes in the levels of Pyk2 and FAK mRNA were quantified by
real-time PCR (b), or by immunoblotting (c). Changes in β3 integrin (β3-Int) expression
served as a surrogate marker for EMT, while β-actin served as a loading control. (d) 4T1
cells were treated for 0–72 h with the inhibitors against TβR-I (TBR1 or SBTBR) or Src
(PP2). Afterward, changes in basal levels of Pyk2 expression were assessed by immunoblot
analysis. (e) Dual-bioluminescent SBE reporter 4T1 cells were propagated in traditional 2Dor 3D-organotypic cultures for 4 days in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) prior
to monitoring firefly and renilla luciferase activity. Data are the mean (±SE) of 3
independent experiments completed in triplicate. (f) Control (scram) or Smad4-depleted
(shSmad4) MDA-231-CP4 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 48 h. Smad4depleted cells failed to upregulate Pyk2. Data in Panels a, c, d, and f are representative of at
least 2 independent experiments, while those in Panel b are the mean (±SD) of 2
independent experiments completed in duplicate.

(shPyk2) 4T07 cells were propagated in 3D-organotypic cultures for 4 days in the absence
or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) or the TβR-I inhibitor, SB431542 (SBTBR; 10 µM) as
shown. Changes in organoid outgrowth were quantified by bioluminescence. Data in Panels
a and c are the mean (±SE) of 3 independent experiments completed in triplicate. (d) Preand Post-EMT control (i.e., scram) or Pyk2-deficient (shPyk2) 4T07 cells were inoculated
into the lateral tail vein (5×104 cells/mouse). Shown are bioluminescent images of
representative mice 2 weeks after injection. (e) Data are the mean (±SE; n=5 mice per
group) area flux values normalized to the injected values (T0) for Panel d.

Pyk2 is essential in generating an outgrowth proficient phenotype. (a) Control (i.e., scram)
and Pyk2-deficient (shPyk2#1 and #2) 4T07 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml)
for 48 h, at which point altered expression of Pyk2, FAK, β1-Integrin and E-cad were
monitored by immunoblot analyses. (b) Parental (GFP), wild-type (WT), or ΔE-E-cadexpressing D2.A1 cells expressing were propagated in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5
ng/ml) in 3D-organotypic cultures for 72 h conditions, at which point differences in Pyk2
expression were monitored by immunoblot analyses. (c) Control and Pyk2-depleted 4T07
cells were propagated for 5 days in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) in
traditional 2D–cultures (2D) or in 3D-organotypic cultures (3D). Afterward, changes in
Pyk2, E-cad, β1 Integrin and β-actin were monitored by immunoblotting. (d) Control (i.e.,
scram) and β1 Integrin-deficient (shβ1 Int) 4T07 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/
ml) for 48 h, at which point altered expression of Pyk2, E-cad, β1-Integrin and were
monitored by immunoblot analyses. Data in Panels a-d are representative of at least 2
independent experiments.

Schematic depicting the formation of “Oncogenic TGF-β Signaling Complexes” comprised
of β3 integrin (32), Src (48), and FAK (18), whose activation is required for TGF-β aberrant
signaling and the initiation of EMT programs (Left). The consequences of these reactions
results in the regulation of several factors that contribute to increased cellular invasiveness,
including the upregulation of β3 Integrin and downregulation of E-cad. Subsequent to
seeding at a secondary site, downregulated E-cad expression, upregulated Pyk2 expression
and the stabilization of β1 integrin are necessary to escape systemic dormancy (4).
Collectively, this interdependent relationship between E-cad, Pyk2, and β1 integrin
functions in EMT-initiated pulmonary outgrowth by metastatic breast cancers (Right).

Oncomine 4.4 analysis of Pyk2 expression in normal and malignant MECs and tissues revealed significant increases in Pyk2 expression in invasive
and recurrent human breast cancers. Analysis of microarray data from MDA-231 cells depleted for the BMP-antagonist, Coco (GSE28049),
demonstrated that elevated BMP signaling suppressed Pyk2 expression. shScram, nontargeting shRNA. shCoco, shRNA targeting Coco.
