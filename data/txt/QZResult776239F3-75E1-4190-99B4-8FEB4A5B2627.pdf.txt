Abstract
Treatment with ipilimumab improves overall survival (OS)
in patients with metastatic melanoma. Because ipilimumab
targets T lymphocytes and not the tumor itself, efﬁcacy may
be uniquely sensitive to immunomodulatory factors present at
the time of treatment. We analyzed serum from patients with
metastatic melanoma (247 of 273, 90.4%) randomly assigned
to receive ipilimumab or gp100 peptide vaccine. We quantiﬁed
candidate biomarkers at baseline and assessed the association
of each using multivariate analyses. Results were conﬁrmed in
an independent cohort of similar patients (48 of 52, 92.3%)
treated with ipilimumab. After controlling for baseline covariates, elevated chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 11 (CXCL11)
and soluble MHC class I polypeptide–related chain A (sMICA)
were associated with poor OS in ipilimumab-treated patients

[log10 CXCL11: HR, 1.88; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 1.14–
3.12; P ¼ 0.014; and log10 sMICA quadratic effect P ¼ 0.066;
sMICA ( 247 vs. 247): HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.02–3.01]. Multivariate analysis of an independent ipilimumab-treated cohort
conﬁrmed the association between log10 CXCL11 and OS (HR,
3.18; 95% CI, 1.13–8.95; P ¼ 0.029), whereas sMICA was less
strongly associated with OS [log10 sMICA quadratic effect P ¼
0.16; sMICA (247 vs. 247): HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.67–3.27].
High baseline CXCL11 and sMICA were associated with poor
OS in patients with metastatic melanoma after ipilimumab
treatment but not vaccine treatment. Thus, pretreatment
CXCL11 and sMICA may represent predictors of survival beneﬁt
after ipilimumab treatment as well as therapeutic targets. Cancer

Introduction

received ipilimumab monotherapy achieved a 28.4% four-year
OS rate (6). Despite the success of ipilimumab, the majority of the
patients on this study died as a consequence of melanoma. With
an increasing number of treatment options available and
increased use of targeted therapies, predictive biomarkers that
identify those patients most likely to beneﬁt from a speciﬁc
treatment are needed (7, 8).
Unlike traditional cancer therapies, immunotherapeutics act
primarily upon cells of the immune system. The requirement for
the immune system as a third-party mediator of the drug's activity
suggests the balance of positive and negative regulators of the
immune response at the time of therapy may be a critical determinant of efﬁcacy for any immunotherapy. Cytokines, chemokines, and soluble receptors regulate the survival, activity, and
location of immune effector cells and thus represent potential
players in determining drug efﬁcacy. Of particular interest are
soluble factors involved in the recruitment and regulation of
effector T cells representing the most readily measurable clinical
biomarkers.
To identify candidate soluble factor(s) predictive of improved
survival following ipilimumab treatment, we analyzed pretreatment sera from treatment (ipilimumab) and "active control"
(gp100 vaccine) patients from the pivotal phase III clinical trial
of ipilimumab (4) for a variety of factors and correlated their
levels with OS. A hypothesis-guided panel of candidate biomarkers was selected, including biomarkers previously reported to
associate with response to ipilimumab. Each analyte was assessed
in univariate and multivariate models for its correlation with OS.

Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4). CTLA-4 is expressed on
activated T cells, has structural similarities to the costimulatory
molecule CD28, and binds to the same ligands as CD28 albeit
with higher afﬁnity. Binding of CTLA-4 to CD80/CD86 inhibits Tcell activation by limiting IL2 production and expression of the
IL2 receptor (CD25; ref. 1). Ipilimumab prevents CTLA-4 from
binding its ligands, thus promoting activation of effector T cells
via prolonged CD28 signaling (2). In addition, anti-CTLA-4
antibodies can deplete intratumoral regulatory T cells, subverting
yet another mechanism of immunosuppression (3).
Ipilimumab improved overall survival (OS) in patients with
metastatic melanoma in a randomized, double-blinded phase III
clinical trial (4, 5). Patients with metastatic melanoma who

Immunoregulatory Proteins Predict Outcome of Ipilimumab Treatment

Correlative biomarkers identiﬁed in the initial screen were further
validated by testing sera from an independent cohort of ipilimumab-treated patients at our institution.

Patients and Methods
Clinical trials
Detailed information regarding the phase III clinical trial of
ipilimumab (NCT00094653) was reported elsewhere (4). Brieﬂy,
patients with metastatic melanoma having failed at least one prior
therapy that may have included IL2, dacarbazine, and/or temozolomide were enrolled excluding those with ocular melanoma.
All patients were HLA-A 0201þ as the restricting element for the
gp100 peptides used. All ipilimumab-treated patients received
ipilimumab alone at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 treatments. In
the gp100 group, patients received two peptides (1 mg each),
injected subcutaneously as an emulsion with incomplete Freund's
adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51). Peptide injections were given
immediately after 90-minute intravenous infusion of placebo.
Tumor burden was assessed by the treating physician as previously described (4).
Serum samples were also obtained from patients treated on an
expanded access program at the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute
(EACRI cohort). Detailed information regarding this Compassionate Use Trial for Unresectable Melanoma with Ipilimumab is
available elsewhere (NCT00495066). All patients received ipilimumab alone (3 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 treatments) with
no exclusions for ocular primary melanomas or HLA type.
All patients provided written informed consent and all studies
were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
under good clinical practice and Institutional Review Board
approval.
Serum cytokine analysis
Serum was collected and stored at 80 C. Chemokine (C-C
motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3, CCL4, CCL8, CCL18, CCL26,
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL9), CXCL10, CXCL11,
CXCL13, and VEGF were measured using a bead-based multiplexed immunoassay (R&D Systems). Soluble MHC class I polypeptide–related sequence A (sMICA), sMICB, soluble UL16-binding protein (sULBP)-1, sULBP-2, sULBP-3, and sULBP-4 were
measured using a custom multiplex bead array (R&D Systems).
Bead-based assays were analyzed using the Luminex-based BioPlex system (BIO-RAD). Soluble CD25 (sCD25) and soluble
lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (sLAG-3) were measured by ELISA
(R&D Systems). Serum sHLA-G was measured by ELISA (Exbio
Vestec). Only serum cytokines having statistical signiﬁcance in
univariate analyses of OS were reported.
Statistical considerations
Differences in patient baseline characteristics between treatment groups (ipilimumab vs. gp100) or trials (phase III vs.
compassionate use) were evaluated using a t test for age and c2
tests for gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prior IL2 therapy, and prior immunotherapy. Differences in baseline serum
biomarkers between study and treatment groups were tested with
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests because of skewed distributions.
Analysis of OS was conducted in the phase III trial and separately in the conﬁrmatory EACRI cohort due to the differences in
the patient populations, study design, and study protocol. In the

www.aacrjournals.org

phase III trial, differences within treatment group were of primary
interest and thus tested in separate models. Survival was deﬁned
as time from beginning of ipilimumab treatment to date of death,
censoring at date of last follow-up. To calculate median follow-up
time, deaths were censored.
Univariate survival analysis was performed for each treatment
subgroup using Cox proportional hazards regression. Effects of
CXCL11, sMICA, sMICB, sCD25, VEGF, absolute lymphocyte
counts (ALC), tumor burden, and effect of LDH [ vs. > upper
limit of normal (ULN)] were shown. Models of quadratic effects
to examine possible nonlinear effects and models of linear effects
of continuous variables were tested. When the quadratic effect was
not signiﬁcant or the linear effect was more strongly signiﬁcant,
main effects model results were reported. For sMICA and VEGF,
quadratic effect was signiﬁcant in some models. To present an HR,
results are also reported for a categorized variable, with the cutoff
point determined as the quintile where a threshold effect was
observed in the phase III trial. Kaplan–Meier plots used for
determining cutoff points are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.
In multivariate analyses, model results of the remaining variables
(other than sMICA), however, are from the model containing the
continuous form of the variable with the quadratic effect. Continuous measures were approximately log normal and analyzed as
log10-transformed.
In multivariate analysis of OS, Cox proportional hazards
regression was used to test effects of biomarker candidates on
survival after controlling for other biomarkers and baseline
patient characteristics. Only CXCL11 and sMICA were included,
as they were signiﬁcant in univariate survival models of the
ipilimumab group but not the gp100 group. Covariates in models
for both studies were age, gender, ECOG status, prior immunotherapy, LDH, and ALC. Tumor burden was also included in
multivariate model for the phase III trial cohort, but not the EACRI
cohort as these data were not captured.
Analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.).
Forest plots were prepared using Forest Plot Viewer (9) and edited
using Adobe Illustrator. GraphPad Prism was used for depicting
some Kaplan–Meier plots.

Results
Patient characteristics of phase III study
Demographics for the phase III study were previously reported
(4). Brieﬂy, 676 patients were enrolled with 137 selected to receive
ipilimumab monotherapy (treatment group), 136 to receive
gp100 monotherapy (control group), and 403 treated with the
combination of these agents. Biomarker analysis was restricted to
the monotherapy groups. Baseline characteristics were similar
between monotherapy groups (Table 1), except that a higher
proportion of patients received prior immunotherapy in the
gp100 alone group (P ¼ 0.036; Table 1, column D). Patients
were followed for a median of 31 months (range, 27–43 months).
OS of the ipilimumab group was 45.6% at 12 months, 33.2% at
18 months, and 23.5% at 24 months, with a median OS of 10.1
months [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 8.0–13.8]. OS of the
gp100 group was 25.3% at 12 months, 16.3% at 18 months, and
13.7% at 24 months with a median OS of 6.4 months (95% CI,
5.5–8.7). Analysis of soluble immunomodulatory proteins was
performed on serum collected prior to treatment. Baseline
CXCL11 concentrations were comparable between ipilimumab
(median, 38; range, 2–1,027 pg/mL) and gp100 (median, 39;

were consistent between ipilimumab (median, 115; range, 13–
1,573 pg/mL) and gp100 (median, 121; range, 13–2,074 pg/mL)
groups.
CXCL11, sMICA, and OS
Univariate analysis of ipilimumab-treated patients showed that
a 10-fold increase in CXCL11 was associated with double the risk
of death (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.40–3.11; P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 1),
whereas CXCL11 was not associated with OS in the gp100 group
(HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.87–1.68; P ¼ 0.2597). The effect of CXCL11
on OS was signiﬁcantly different for the ipilimumab group versus
the gp100 group (P ¼ 0.040). In the univariate analysis of log10
sMICA, higher sMICA was associated with decreased survival in
the ipilimumab group [log10 sMICA quadratic effect P < 0.0001;
sMICA (247 vs. <247): HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.16–5.56 with P <
0.0001] but not in the gp100 group (log10 sMICA HR, 0.91; 95%
CI, 0.61–1.36; P ¼ 0.6373). Elevated sMICB, LDH, tumor burden,
and sCD25 were all associated with poorer survival regardless of
treatment (Fig. 1). Elevated VEGF was also associated with
decreased survival in both groups, although marginally so for
the ipilimumab-treated group (Fig. 1). Higher numbers of lymphocytes (ALC) at baseline were associated with better OS in both
treatment groups (Fig. 1). These univariate analyses suggest that
CXCL11 and sMICA are potential predictors of OS in ipilimumabtreated melanoma patients, whereas sMICB, sCD25, VEGF, LDH,
tumor burden, and ALC represent putative prognostic biomarkers.
Multivariate analyses were also conducted focusing on CXCL11
and sMICA, as these two biomarkers were identiﬁed in the
univariate analysis as correlating with ipilimumab but not gp100
treatment. Models were used to test the independent effects of
CXCL11 and sMICA after adjusting for each other and the covariates LDH, ALC, tumor burden, age, sex, and ECOG status.

5086 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

Within the ipilimumab-treated group CXCL11 and LDH, but not
tumor burden, ALC, age, sex, or ECOG score, were associated with
OS (log10 CXCL11 HR, 1.88; 95% CI; 1.14–3.12; P ¼ 0.014: LDH
HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.78–5.02; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2A). sMICA was also
associated with OS [log10 sMICA quadratic effect P ¼ 0.0659;
sMICA (247 vs. <247): HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.02–3.01 with P ¼
0.0420] but less strongly than CXCL11 (Fig. 2A). In the gp100treated group, only LDH was independently associated with OS
(LDH: HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.36–3.69; P ¼ 0.0016; Fig. 2B). These
multivariate results again suggest that CXCL11 and sMICA are
potential predictive biomarkers of OS in ipilimumab-treated
melanoma patients, whereas LDH represents a prognostic biomarker for patients with melanoma irrespective of treatment.
CXCL11 and sMICA in an independent ipilimumab-treated
cohort
We analyzed sera from patients with melanoma (48 of 52,
92.3%) collected prior to treatment with ipilimumab in an
expanded access program at our institution (EACRI cohort).
When comparing patient characteristics between the ipilimumab-treated phase III trial cohort and the EACRI cohort, we found
more patients in the EACRI cohort with elevated LDH (P ¼
0.0007), prior IL2 therapy (P < 0.0001), and prior immunotherapy (P < 0.0001; Table 1, column A, C, and E). This comparison
suggests that the EACRI cohort included more patients with
advanced disease and poorer prognosis. This discrepancy may
account for shorter median survival of the EACRI cohort (8.6
months) relative to that of ipilimumab-treated phase III trial
cohort (10.1 months). In the EACRI cohort, median follow-up
was 39 months (range, 0.8–40 months).
Univariate analyses showed that elevated pretreatment concentrations of CXCL11, sCD25, and LDH were associated with an
increased risk of death (Fig. 3). Similar to phase III study ﬁndings,

a 10-fold increase in CXCL11 was associated with a 3.7-fold
increase in the risk of death (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.71–8.22; P ¼

threshold effect as seen in the Kaplan–Meier plots of survival
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Elevated sMICA was also associated with
increased risk of death [log10 sMICA quadratic effect: P ¼ 0.0244;

OS in this cohort [log10 sMICA quadratic effect: P ¼ 0.1589;
sMICA (247 vs. <247): HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.67–3.27 with P ¼

LDH and somewhat small cohort size. Thus, we conﬁrmed the
predictive association between CXCL11 and OS in ipilimumabtreated melanoma patients but found a weaker association
between sMICA and OS in the EACRI cohort. We also conﬁrmed
the association between LDH and OS in the EACRI cohort,
compatible with the notion that LDH is a prognostic marker for
patients with metastatic melanoma.

Kaplan–Meier survival curves
To illustrate the effects of CXC11 and sMICA on OS in the
phase III trial, Kaplan–Meier survival plots are shown (Fig. 5)
for the biomarker high or low groups on the basis of selected
cutoff points (the median of CXC11; 35 pg/mL, the 80th
percentile of sMICA; 247 pg/mL, Fig. 5A and B). Because of
the quadratic association of sMICA with survival, the 80th
percentile was the cutoff point chosen on the basis of the
approximate threshold value seen in the sMICA quintile plot
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Kaplan–Meier survival plots for the
EACRI cohort are also shown using the same cutoff points as
used for the phase III study data plot (Fig. 5C and D). The
distribution of baseline CXCL11 was lower and the distribution
of sMICA levels was higher in the conﬁrmatory cohort (Table 1,
column E). Nonetheless, both cutoff points successfully dichotomize patients treated with ipilimumab into patients with poor
or better OS.

Discussion
We found that high baseline serum CXCL11 and sMICA were
associated with poor OS in patients with metastatic melanoma
treated with ipilimumab but not in patients treated with a
"control" gp100 vaccine. This association was validated in an
independent cohort of ipilimumab-treated melanoma patients,
strongly suggesting that measurement of pretreatment serum
CXCL11 and sMICA levels may identify patients most likely to

beneﬁt from ipilimumab. Because a minority of patients with
melanoma beneﬁt from ipilimumab, avoiding treatment of these
refractory patients would reduce exposure to inefﬁcient therapy,
eliminate their risks for adverse effects and lower overall costs of
therapy.
Potential predictors of responsiveness to ipilimumab treatment
have been identiﬁed in previous reports. For instance, elevated
levels of several candidate biomarkers [e.g., C-reactive protein
(CRP; refs. 10, 11), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; ref. 12),
LDH (10–14), S100 protein (12), sCD25 (15), and VEGF (16)]
were thought to associate with reduced beneﬁt following ipilimumab treatment. In contrast, increased baseline ALC were
associated with improved OS upon ipilimumab treatment (10–
14, 17). Interestingly, each of these candidate biomarkers were at
some time reported as prognostic biomarkers for melanoma (18,
19). We were fortunate to have serum samples from the phase III
study comparing an ipilimumab-treated cohort with a control
cohort allowing us to differentiate predictive versus prognostic
biomarkers (20). We also used samples from a second independent cohort of ipilimumab-treated patients to validate our basic
ﬁndings, which together with multivariate analyses, diminished
the possibility of coincidental inﬂuence from other covariates.
These analyses have demonstrated the predictive nature of
CXCL11 and sMICA for patients treated with ipilimumab, and
the prognostic nature of sMICB, VEGF, sCD25, LDH, and ALC for
all patients with melanoma independent of treatment with
ipilimumab.

High biomarker level better High biomarker level worse

Our data revealed a strong association between elevated
serum CXCL11 protein and reduced OS upon ipilimumab
treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma. CXCL11,
along with CXCL9 and CXCL10, binds to CXCR3, a critical
chemokine receptor for directional migration of TH1 and cytotoxic T cells (21). In contrast to our ﬁndings with serum
CXCL11, tissue expression of CXCL11 mRNA correlates with
T-cell inﬁltration into tumors and improved prognosis (22).
Microarray analysis of mRNA expression in melanoma tissues
from ipilimumab-treated patients also associated baseline and
posttreatment tissue expression of CXCL11 with presence of T
cells in tumor and favorable clinical responses (23). The discrepancy between these results and ours may be attributed to
sample source (tissue vs. serum) and/or assay targets (mRNA
vs. protein). Paired analysis of mRNAs and proteins in tissue
and serum might provide evidence to resolve this discrepancy.
As CXCL11 has distinct immunoregulatory functions, in contrast to immunostimulatory functions mediated by CXCL9 and
CXCL10 (24, 25), we prefer the following nonmutually exclusive explanations of how CXCL11, even in the presence of
CXCL9 and CXCL10, may limit T-cell effector function as a
part of negative feedback loop: (i) disrupting chemokine gradients for directional migration of T cells (26), (ii) preventing
CXCR3–CXCL9/10 interaction by promoting receptor internalization (24), (iii) suppressing T-cell responses through induction and/or recruitment of regulatory T cells (25, 27), and (iv)
promoting growth and metastasis of tumors expressing CXCR3
(28–31).

Elevated levels of sMICA and sMICB have been reported in
several types of malignant diseases and implicated in cancer
immunoevasion (32). While the cellular stress response in transformed cells induces expression of membrane-bound MICA/
MICB, the cleavage of these molecules produces soluble forms
of MICA and MICB capable of inhibiting interactions between
membrane-bound MICA/MICB and NKG2D, thus desensitizing
the activation signal through NKG2D in effector T cells and
natural killer (NK) cells (33). The cleavage of membrane-bound
MICA/MICB is promoted by the metalloprotease ADAM10 and is
enhanced within hypoxic tumor environments (34). As hypoxia
also promotes expression of immune inhibitory molecules (e.g.,
PD-L1 and LAG-3) and favors accumulation of regulatory
immune cells (35), sMICA may be a biomarker that reﬂects this
immunosuppressive tumor environment.
The greatest signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings may ultimately be in
the identiﬁcation of CXCL11 and sMICA as immunotherapeutic
targets. Agents that inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of
CXCL11 and sMICA without preventing interaction of the receptors (CXCR3 and NKG2D, respectively) with immunopotentiating ligands (CXCL9/CXCL10 and membrane-bound MICA,
respectively) may have therapeutic activity in patients with cancer,
either alone or with other agents, including chemotherapeutics,
radiation, or other immunotherapeutics. To explore this idea,
future studies should address whether CXCL11 and sMICA directly interfere with ipilimumab-enabled effector T cells or are merely
elevated as a result of the immunosuppressive environment found
in patients refractory to ipilimumab therapy.
