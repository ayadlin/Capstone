ABSTRACT
Since disturbance of angiogenesis predisposes to ischemic injuries, attempts to
promote angiogenesis have been made to improve clinical outcomes of patients with
many ischemic disorders. While hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) stimulate vascular
remodeling and angiogenesis, hyperlipidemia impairs angiogenesis in response to
various pro-angiogenic factors. However, it remains uncertain how HIFs regulate
angiogenesis under hyperlipidemia. Here, we report that exposure to low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) suppressed in vitro angiogenesis of human brain microvascular
endothelial cells. Whereas LDL exposure diminished expression of HIF-1` and HIF-2`
induced by hypoxia, it inhibited DMOG- and TNF`-induced HIF-1` and HIF-2`
expression in normoxia. Notably, in both hypoxia and normoxia, LDL markedly reduced
expression of HIF-1β, a constitutively stable HIF subunit, an event associated with NFκB inactivation. Moreover, knockdown of HIF-1β down-regulated HIF-1` and HIF-2`
expression, in association with increased HIF-1` hydroxylation and 20S proteasome
activity after LDL exposure. Significantly, the proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 prevented
angiogenesis attenuation by LDL through restoring expression of HIFs. Together, these
findings argue that HIF-1β might act as a novel cross-link between the HIF and NF-κB
pathways in suppression of angiogenesis by LDL, while proteasome inhibitors might
promote angiogenesis by reactivating this signaling cascade under hyperlipidemia.

under the conditions of hypoperfusion, in order to improve
outcomes of patients with ischemic disorders. Among
them, the approaches for ischemic preconditioning (IPC)
or stabilizing HIF-α (e.g., by inhibition of HIF-specific
prolyl hydroxylases, PHDs) offer potential therapeutic
strategies to treat various ischemic disorders, including

peripheral artery occlusive disease, myocardial infarction,
and stroke. [1–6] HIF-1α, a protein expressed ubiquitously
in virtually all cell types, governs cellular responses
to hypoxia, including initiation of angiogenesis. [7–9]
HIF-2α is selectively expressed in certain cell types,
particularly in vascular endothelial cells, which therefore
has recently implicated in regulation of angiogenesis
and neovascularization. [10, 11] In hypoxia, HIF-α
subunits form the heterodimers with the constitutively
stable subunit HIF-1β (also known as ARNT) to induce
transcription of genes with diverse adaptive functions.
However, under well-oxygenated conditions, HIF-α
subunits are hydroxylated at the conserved proline
residues, which are then recognized by the von HippelLindau protein (pVHL) complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
leading to degradation via the 26S proteasome. [7–9, 12]
Moreover, NF-κB increases HIF-1β stabilization, [13, 14]
suggesting a potential role of NF-κB in regulation of the
HIF pathways in ischemic diseases. [6, 15]
However, vascular remodeling remains a challenge
particularly in patients with severe atherosclerosis.
[16–18] Atherosclerosis is known to associate with
hypercholesterolemia that causes deposition of lipids
into the blood vessel wall. For example, about half of
patients with ischemic stroke have hypercholesterolemia,
[19] while human subjects with hypercholesterolemia
often have high risk of stroke mortality. [20, 21] In this
context, increased cholesterol levels can trigger a number
of vascular abnormalities, such as oxidative stress,
incapacitated vasodilation, inflammation, as well as
impaired angiogenesis. [22–24]
To address the clinical issue that ischemic diseases
occur frequently in atherosclerosis patients with
hyperlipidemia, we hypothesized that blood lipids might
impair angiogenic responses to hypoxia, TNFα, or PHD
inhibitors, via inhibition of the HIF pathways. The present
studies provide evidence for the role of LDL in attenuating
angiogenic response of endothelial cells to hypoxia,

DMOG (dimethyloxaloylglycine, an inhibitor of PHD) or
TNFα, in association with ­down-regulation of HIFs, most
likely through promoting their proteasomal degradation.
Of note, it is the first time, to the best of our knowledge,
to show that the proteasomal inhibitor BSc2118 restore
LDL-attenuated angiogenesis by reactivation of HIF-1α
and HIF-2α.

RESULTS
Native, but not oxidized, LDL attenuates
angiogenesis of endothelial cells, an event
associated with down-regulation of HIF-1α,
HIF-2α, and HIF-1β
To test our hypothesis that the HIF family is involved
in attenuation of angiogenesis under hyperlipidemia, we first
examined whether LDL impairs angiogenesis induced by
hypoxia using an immortalised human brain microvascular
endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) as a model. hCMEC/
D3 cells were exposed to 50–100 μg/ml native LDL under
hypoxic (1% O2) condition, after which cell proliferation and
Matrigel-based tube formation assays were performed. As
shown in Fig. 1, native form of LDL markedly attenuated
both proliferation (Fig. 1A) and tube formation (Fig. 1B–
1C) of hCMEC/D3 cells in hypoxia. Western blot analysis
revealed that whereas hypoxia markedly induced expression
of HIF-1α and HIF-2α (Suppl. Fig. 1), native LDL
significantly reduced the protein abundance of HIF-1α and
HIF-2α in hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Notably, while HIF-1β was
constitutively expressed regardless of oxygen availability
(i.e., in both normoxia and hypoxia; Suppl. Fig. 1), native
LDL reduced expression of HIF-1β under normoxic
condition (Fig. 2B–2D). In contrast, oxidized LDL (oxLDL) failed to reduce mRNA levels of HIF-1β (Suppl. Fig.
2A). Moreover, native LDL also attenuated protein levels
of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-1β in cytoplasmic and especially
nuclear fraction of hCMEC/D3 cells treated with the

immortalised human brain microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 cells cultured in Microvascular Endothelial Cell Medium-2,
containing either 0.5% FBS for proliferation assay or 5% FBS for tube formation assay, were treated (72 hr) with the indicated concentrations
of native LDL under hypoxic (1% oxygen) condition, after which cells were subjected to the following assays: A. cell proliferation assay
using the BrdU Flow Kit; B–C. Matrigel-based tube formation assay. Three independent experiments (n = 3) were performed. *p < 0.05,

50–100 μg/ml LDL for additional 72 hr, after which expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
was assessed by Western blot analysis. Blots re-probed for β-actin and laminin A were used as loading controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractions, respectively. All blots were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ software. The relative protein abundance was calculated
by comparing to either β-actin or Laminin A and expressed as fold increase over controls (without LDL treatment). Values for controls were
arbitrarily set to 1.0. At least three independent experiments (n ≥ 3) were performed. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (for whole cell
lysates or cytoplasmic fraction); +p < 0.05, ++p < 0.01, +++p < 0.001 (for nuclear fraction) versus their controls; ns, not significant.

prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine
(DMOG, an agent known to induce HIF activation; [26]
Fig. 2E), suggesting that LDL might prevent dimerization
of HIF-1β with HIF-1α or HIF-2α and thus inhibit their
transcriptional activation in the nuclei. However, oxLDL was not able to alter protein levels of HIF-1α, HIF2α, and HIF-1β in hCMEC/D3 cells treated with DMOG
(Suppl. Fig. 2B). Further, the free radical scavenger phenylN-tert-butyLnitrone (PBN) [27] failed to prevent downregulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α by LDL in hCMEC/
D3 cells treated with DMOG (Suppl. Fig. 2C), supporting
the notion that oxidation might be not required for LDL
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to inhibit HIF activation. However, whereas no effect on
mRNA levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α was noted (Suppl.
Fig. 3A–3B), LDL increased, rather than reduced, HIF-1β
mRNA expression in hCMEC/D3 cells with or without
DMOG (24 h in particular; Suppl. Fig. 3C–3D), probably
reflecting a compensatory response to down-regulation
of HIF-1β protein. Together, these findings argue that in
normoxia, native LDL (but not oxidized LDL) inhibits
angiogenesis likely through down-regulation of HIF-1β.
They also raise a possibility that the mechanism(s) other than
inhibition of de novo gene expression might be involved in
HIF-1β down-regulation by LDL.

LDL prevents TNFα-induced expression of HIFs
through inactivation of the NF-κB pathway in
endothelial cells

largely prevented TNFα-induced expression of HIF-1α,
HIF-2α, and HIF-1β at protein level in hCMEC/D3 cells
(Suppl. Fig. 4A–4D). Similarly, LDL diminished  both
NF-κB activation (e.g., inhibition of p65 induction) and
up-regulation of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and particularly HIF-1β
in response of hCMEC/D3 cells to TNFα (Fig. 3A). Of
note, LDL also decreased basal levels of NF-κB p65 in
a dose-dependent manner in hCMEC/D3 cells (Fig. 3B).
To validate the role of the NF-κB pathway in this setting,
NF-κB p65 was knocked down using shRNA. Indeed,
down-regulation of p65 by shRNA mimicked the capability
of LDL to inhibit HIF-1β expression in hCMEC/D3 cells
(Fig. 3C). In contrast,  shRNA knockdown of HIF-1β
failed to decrease NF-κB p65 expression (Fig. 3D). These
findings argue that LDL down-regulates expression of
HIF-1β via a NF-κB-dependent process.

Ischemia induces production of TNFα, which
in turn promotes cerebral angiogenesis. [15] In this
context, we observed that TNFα sharply induced
expression of HIF-1β, while moderately increased
protein levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in hCMEC/D3
cells (Fig. 3A). These events  were accompanied by
activation of the NF-κB pathway, reflected by a marked
increase in protein expression of p65, a key component
of  the  most  abundant NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer, in
hCMEC/D3 cells  exposed to TNFα, a  classical NF-κB
agonist. Moreover, co-administration of either the NF-κB
inhibitor PDTC or  the IKK inhibitor Bay 11-7082

HIF-1β acts as a cross-link between inhibition
of NF-κB and attenuation of HIF-1α/HIF-2α
expression in endothelial cells exposed to LDL

(Fig. 4F). Together, these findings argue that LDL induces
HIF-1α degradation via the UPS, in association with
increased proline hydroxylation as well as 20S proteasome
activity. They also suggest that inhibition of the UPS
by proteasome inhibitors (e.g., BSc2118) might reverse
impairment of angiogenesis by LDL via restoration of HIF
(HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-1β) expression.

Up-regulation of HIF-1α expression by NF-κB
represents an important mechanism that governs the 
HIF pathway. [13, 14] While inhibitors of the NF-κB
pathway (e.g., PDTC, Bay 11-7082) blocked TNFαinduced expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β
(Suppl. Fig. 4A–4D), qPCR revealed that NF-κB inhibition
(e.g.,  by  Bay 11-7082) only abrogated up-regulation
of HIF-1β mRNA in hCMEC/D3 cells exposed TNFα
(Suppl. Fig. 5A–5C). Interestingly, whereas TNFα did
not induce mRNA expression of either HIF-1α or HIF2α, Bay 11-7082 failed to reduce their mRNA levels in
hCMEC/D3 cells with or without induction by TNFα.
Thus, these results raise a possibility that HIF-1α, as well
as HIF-2α, might not be up-regulated directly by NF-κB.
To this end, it was observed that HIF-1β knockdown by
shRNA decreased protein expression of both HIF-1α and
HIF-2α in the presence of TNFalpha in hCMEC/D3 cells,
while did not alter NF-κB p65 abundance (Fig.  3D).
However, the protein level of aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR), known as a binding partner of HIF-1β, was not
changed after HIF-1β knockdown (Fig.  3D). These
findings support a notion that LDL suppresses HIF-1β gene
expression through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, which
in turn specifically results in reduction of HIF-1α and HIF2α protein levels. Thus, HIF-1β may act as a cross-link
between the NF-κB and HIF signaling pathways, as well as
play a crucial role in inhibition of the HIF family by LDL.

The proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 restores
LDL-attenuated angiogenesis of endothelial
cells, in association with reactivation of the
HIF pathway
Finally, to examine whether up-regulation of HIFs
by proteasome inhibitors could reverse attenuation of
angiogenesis in hyperlipidemia, the effects of BSc2118
on hCMEC/D3 cells after exposed to LDL were analyzed.
First, the dose-response experiments were performed
to determine the non-toxic doses of BSc2118 towards
hCMEC/D3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, although
BSc2118 concentrations ≥ 400 nM were cytotoxic, the
doses ≤ 200 nM of this agent had virtually no effect
on viability  of  hCMEC/D3 cells. The latter nontoxic
doses were then chosen to further conduct the following
experiments. Second, Western blot analysis revealed that
administration of 200 nM BSc2118 resulted in marked
increases in proteins levels of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and
HIF-1β in hCMEC/D3 cells, with or without induction
by DMOG (Fig. 5B–5C). Notably, lower concentrations
(e.g.,  100  nM) of BSc2118 also strikingly induced
expression of HIF-1β, but not HIF-1α and HIF-2α
(Fig. 5B–5C). These results further support the critical role
of HIF-1β in regulation of the HIF pathway. HIF-1α and
HIF-2α accumulation also reflected a synergistic  effect
between DMOG and BSc2118 (Fig. 5B–5C). Third,
consistent with up-regulation of HIFs, the non-toxic
concentrations (e.g., 200 nM) of BSc2118 significantly
promoted tube formation of hCMEC/D3 cells (Fig. 5D).
Last, although there was a little effect by itself (Fig. 5D),
lower concentrations (e.g., 100 nM) of BSc2118 also
restored LDL-attenuated angiogeneisis of hCMEC/D3
cells reflected by increased cell proliferation and tube
formation, in both normoxia (Fig. 6A–6B) and hypoxia
(Fig. 6C–6D). Together, these findings indicate that the
proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 is able to reverse inhibition
of angiogenesis by LDL, most likely through reactivation
of the HIF pathway. They also raise a possibility that
proteasome inhibitors (e.g., BSc2118) might be effective
to treat patients with ischemic diseases, particularly those
related to hyperlipidemia such as atherosclerosis.

LDL induces HIF-1α proline hydroxylation and
promotes 20S proteasome activity in endothelial
cells in both normoxia and hypoxia
In well-oxygenated environments, HIF-1α proline
hydroxylation is critical for recognition by E3 ubiquitin
ligase in the pVHL complex, followed by degradation via
the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). [28] In this context,
LDL reduced abundance of HIF-1α protein (Fig. 2A, 2E, and
3A), but not mRNA (Suppl. Fig. 5A), raising a possibility
that HIF-1α down-regulation by LDL might involve its
turnover through the UPS. Thus, the effect of LDL on HIF-1α
proline hydroxylation was examined. Under hypoxic
condition, exposure to LDL resulted in a marked increase in
proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α at both Pro402 and Pro564
residues in hCMEC/D3 cells (Fig. 4A–4B), accompanied
by sharply increased  chymotrypsin-like activity of 20S
proteasome in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Similar
phenomena were also observed under normoxic condition
(Fig. 4D). Significantly, administration of the proteasome
inhibitor BSc2118 restored abundance of both NF-κB p65
and HIF-1β in cells exposed to LDL in normoxia (Fig. 4E).
Moreover, BSc2118 also reversed attenuation of HIF-1α
and HIF-2α expression by LDL under hypoxic condition

DISCUSSION
Ischemic diseases often correlate to hyperlipidemia
(e.g., in atherosclerosis patients), due to deficiency
of angiogenesis in response to hypoxia in the latter

circumstances. [29] Herein, we hypothesized that
blood lipids such as LDL might inhibit angiogenic
responses. Indeed, the present study demonstrated that
exposure to native LDL, rather than its oxidized form,
markedly suppressed proliferation and tube formation
of endothelial cells in an in vitro model of angiogenesis
using hCMEC/D3 cells, an immortalised human brain
microvascular endothelial cell line. Moreover, it was
found that attenuation of endothelial angiogenesis by
LDL was associated with disruption of the HIF pathway,
including down-regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, in
hypoxia. Furthermore, it was also identified that HIF-1β
plays a central role in regulation of the HIF pathway in
this setting. In this case, LDL down-regulated HIF-1β at
transcriptional level through inhibition of NF-κB, leading
to inactivation of the HIF pathway (e.g., down-regulation
of HIF-1α and HIF-2α) and the resulting attenuation of
angiogenesis in responses to various pro-angiogenic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

factors, including hypoxia, DMOG, and TNFα. Thus, these
findings might provide a new insight into the mechanisms
underlying defective angiogenesis in hyperlipidemia.
In the present study, up-regulation (activation) of
HIF-1α and HIF-2α was not observed in response to the
PHD inhibitor DMOG in endothelial cells after exposed
to LDL. However, expression of HIF-1β, a constitutively
stable subunit that is ubiquitously expressed and forms
a heterodimer with HIF-α, was dramatically decreased
after exposure to LDL, even in the presence of DMOG.
Further, nuclear localization of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and
HIF-1β was diminished by LDL in cells treated with
DMOG, suggesting perturbations of HIF-α/HIF-1β
heterodimerization and transcriptional activation in the
nuclei, an event required for induction of angiogenesis.
On the other hand, hypercholesterolemia has been shown
to impair angiogenesis in vivo by inducing oxidative
stress in blood vessels. [22] Moreover, oxidized LDL

has been found to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation
and migration in vitro, in association with decreased NO
synthase and Akt activity in endothelial cells. [30–32]
However, it is noteworthy that the native form of LDL
displayed anti-angiogenic activity, consistent with those
reported earlier. [33, 34] Surprisingly, oxidized LDL failed
to reduce abundance of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β,
while the antioxidant PBN was not able to rescue LDLinduced down-regulation of HIFs. These results argue
against the role of LDL oxidation in regulation of the HIF
pathway in angiogenesis.

Emerging evidence indicates the cross-talk
between the HIF and NF-κB pathways. For example,
inflammatory stimuli like TNFα activate HIF-1α in
a NF-κB-dependent manner. [13, 14] Moreover, the
role of NF-κB in HIF-1α regulation have implicated in
ischemic diseases. [6] In the present study, it was found
that TNFα not only induced HIF-1α expression, but also
up-regulated HIF-2α and HIF-1β. However, disruption
of NF-κB activation  either by directly suppressing this
pathway (e.g.,  by pharmacological inhibitors) or by
LDL abrogated TNFα-induced up-regulation of HIF-1α,

such as those with middle cerebral artery occlusion.
[35–37] Among others, the potential mechanisms involve
inhibition of the NF-κB and toll-like receptor signaling
pathways. [36–38] Significantly, the proteasome inhibitor
BSc2118 prevented down-regulation of NF-κB p65 as
well as HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β in endothelial cells
exposed to LDL. Consistent with these novel findings,
BSc2118 also restores LDL-attenuated proliferation
and tube formation of endothelial cells. In this context,
our previous study has demonstrated that treatment
with BSc2118 leads to long-term neuroprotection. [38]
Together, the present findings argue that the proteasome
inhibitors (e.g., BSc2118) might promote angiogenesis,
particularly in hyperlipidemia, via restoring activity of the
HIF pathway. However, it cannot be ruled out that other
proteins, particularly those subjected to degradation via
the UPS, also contribute to the mechanism of action of
BSc2118 in this setting.
In summary, the present study using an in vitro
angiogenesis model showed that whereas LDL attenuated
angiogenesis in response to hypoxia through inactivation of
the NF-κB-and HIF-1β-dependent HIF signaling pathway,
the proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 was able to prevent
LDL-mediated anti-angiogenesis by restoration of HIF

HIF-2α, and HIF-1β,  while only blocked transcription
of HIF-1β. Furthermore, whereas shRNA knockdown
of NF-κB p65 directly down-regulated HIF-1β, genetic
knockdown of HIF-1β diminished expression of both
HIF-1α and HIF-2α. These findings further highlight a
functional role of HIF-1β as a novel cross-link between
the NF-κB and HIF signaling pathways.
As down-regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α did
not occur at transcriptional level, a possibility arises that
other mechanism(s) may be involved. To this end, it was
observed that exposure to LDL clearly increased proline
hydroxylation of HIF-1α, an event driving its recognition
by E3 ligase in the VHL complex and subsequently
degradation via the UPS. [7] Importantly, LDL also
markedly promoted chymotrypsin-like activity of 20S
proteasome in both hypoxia and normoxia. To the best of
our knowledge, the phenomena that LDL induces downregulation of HIFs through increasing HIF hydroxylation
and proteasome activity have never been reported before,
which might lay a basis for a therapeutic strategy to
promote angiogenesis in hyperlipidemia by interference
with these events.
Recently, it has been shown that proteasome
inhibition has a neuroprotective effect in animal models

activity. The former might provide a rationale to target
anti-angiogenic effects of LDL that often occurs in patients
with hyperlipidemia. Importantly, the latter findings lay a
foundation for a novel therapeutic strategy using proteasome
inhibitors (e.g., BSc2118) to treat ischemic diseases in
patients with hyperlipidemia. This strategy may have
particular relevance to conditions of chronic hypoperfusion
derived from advanced atherosclerosis in organs like heart
and brain. However, the present findings are solely based on
an in vitro model of angiogenesis using a human endothelial
cell line, which might not entirely reflect the physiological
conditions in intact animals, while acute exposure to LDL
might differ from chronic hyperlipidemia status in patients.
Thus, whereas the succeeding in vivo studies in living
animals is required for further validation of these in vitro
findings, proteasome inhibitors warrant consideration in
the treatment of patients with ischemic diseases such as
stroke or coronary heart disease, particularly those with
hyperlipidemia.

Pro564) antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerca, MA). The
NE-PER Nuclear Protein Extraction Reagent Kit was
purchased from Pierce (Life Technologies, Frederick, MD).

Plasmids and lentivirus transduction
E.coli XL1-blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany)
was generally used for plasmid preparation, while E.coli
Stbl3 (Invitrogen) were used for preparation of pLKO.1
(8453, Addgene, Cambridge, MA), pLKO.1-shRNA-HIF-1α,
pLKO.1-shRNA-HIF-2α, pLKO.1-shRNA-HIF-1β, and
pLKO.1-shRNA-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant
lentivirus was produced as described previously. [25]
hCMEC/D3 cells were infected with lentivirus and then
selected. Western blot analysis was performed to monitor
gene silencing.

LDL oxidation
Briefly, native LDL was dialysed against 1× PBS for
24 hours and then incubated with 10 μM CuSO4 for 24 hours
at 37°C, followed by dialysis against 1× PBS containing
0.1 mM EDTA for 48 hours. Oxidized LDL was harvested
through a 0.22 μm filter and used within one week.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
hCMEC/D3 cells, an immortalised human
brain microvascular endothelial cell line, were kindly
provided by Dr. Pierre-Olivier Couraud (Institut Cochin,
INSERM, Paris), and propagated from passages 25 to 35
in Microvascular Endothelial Cell Medium-2 with 5%
FBS (Lonza, Allendale, NJ, U.S.A.). Cells were cultured
in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. 1% O2
condition used for all hypoxic experiments was achieved
in a chamber with continuous infusion of pre-tested gas
mixture containing 95% N2 and 5% CO2.

Cell viability and proliferation assays
2 × 104 hCMEC/D3 cells suspended in Microvascular
Endothelial Cell Medium-2 containing 0.5% serum were
seeded into 24-well plates. LDL (50–100 μg/ml) and BSc2118
(50–1000 nM) were added either alone or in combination. For
the latter, BSc2118 was added 4 hours prior to LDL. After
incubation for 24 hours, cell viability was analyzed using
the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories,
Kumamoto, Japan). Alternatively, after incubation for
72 hours, cell proliferation was monitored using the BrdU
Flow Kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Reagents
BSc2118, a proteasome inhibitor, was a gift from
Dr.  Kuckelkorn (Charité Universitätsmedizin). LDL and
recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and Peprotech
(Rocky Jill, NJ), respectively. The free radical scavenger
phenyl-N-tert-butyLnitrone (PBN), the NF-κB inhibitor
pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid (PDTC), the IκB kinase
(IKK) inhibitor Bay 11-7082, the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor
dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), and the proteasome
inhibitor MG132, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). The antibodies used in this study include
rabbit anti-human laminin A polyclonal antibody (SigmaAldrich); mouse anti-Human HIF-1α monoclonal antibody
(BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA); human/rat
HIF-2α antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); rabbit
anti-human HIF-1β/ARNT polyclonal antibody, rabbit antihuman NF-κB p65 monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-human
β-actin monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danver, MA); and anti-HIF-1α (hydroxylated Pro402 and

Endothelial cell tube formation assay
2 × 104 hCMEC/D3 cells suspended in Microvascular
Endothelial Cell Medium-2 containing 5% serum were
seeded into 96-well plates pre-coated with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were then incubated
in normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2), in the absence
or presence of 50–100 μg/ml LDL +/− 100 nM BSc2118
(pre-treatment for 4 hours) as described above. After 24
hours, images (magnification, 5 ×) were captured in a 5%
CO2 incubator using a microscope with a DFC-290 camera
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

In vitro proteasome activity assay
Chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) proteasome activity
assay was conducted using the 20S Proteasome Assay Kit,
SDS-Activated (EMD Millipore) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

After exposed to LDL, TNFα, BSc2118, or other
pharmacological inhibitors, or transduced with lentivirus
vectors as described above for the indicated intervals,
hCMEC/D3 cells were harvested. Whole cell lysates were
prepared in NP40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Deutschland, Germany). Whole cell lysates
or cellular fractions (prepared as above) were resolved on
7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDSPAGE) and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes. Membranes were then blocked with 5%
skimmed milk in TBS-T (tris-buffered saline containing
0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.2), followed by incubation with the
primary antibodies (see “Reagents”). Blots were visualized
with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Kit (Pierce,
Life Technologies). Blots were re-probed with anti-β-actin
(Cell Signaling Technology) to ensure equal protein loading.

Author Contributions

hCMEC/D3 cells were pretreated with PDTC or
Bay 11-7082 for 24 hours, followed by exposed to LDL,
DMOG, TNFα alone or in combination with LDL for the
indicated intervals. qPCR analysis using the ABI PRISM
7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) were performed to quantify mRNA
levels of human target genes. Briefly, total RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was
synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA. Gene expression
was then analyzed by two-step real-time PCR: 95°C for
30 seconds, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds,
and 60°C for 34 seconds. The following primers were
used: Hif-1α, 5′-CAAGGGCCACCAGAAGCGCAA-3′,
3′-TTTGGAGAGGATCTTGAGGCTGGA-5′;
Hif-2α,
5′-AGGACTACAGCCTGTCGTCAGC-3′, 3′-CCTTGCA
GGAGCGTGGAG-5′; Hif-1β, 5′-GTGGCAGTAGCT
CTGTGGACC-3′, 3′-AGCCAAGTCCATTCCTGCAT-3′;

3′-GATCTTGAGCTCGGCAGTGT-3; Gapdh, 5′-CATCT
TCCAGGAGCGAGATCC-3′, 3′-GGTGCAGGTGGCA
TTGCTGATG-5′. Reference for quantitation was the
human housekeeping gene Gapdh. All PCR reactions were
run in triplicate, and gene expression relative to Gapdh was
calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method.
