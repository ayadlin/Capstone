tumor surface antigens (Ags). This shortfall may be due to barriers to achieving

ver 85% of human cancers are solid tumors, yet of the 8 mAbs
approved as cancer therapeutics as of 2005, 5 are specific to hematologic malignancies; only 3 (trastuzumab, cetuximab, and bevacizumab) can be used for solid tumors and 1 of these, bevacizumab,
is directed at a soluble ligand, not at a surface protein within solid
tumors.1 This disproportionality reflects the challenges of achieving
effective concentrations within solid tumor masses. With hematologic cancers, Abs can be readily dose-adjusted to reach the desired
serum concentration. However, with solid tumors Abs are in relatively remote equilibrium with their target sites. Anatomical and
physiological properties of solid tumors make them particularly
hard to penetrate. Experimental data using radiolabeled Abs suggests tumor penetration is generally on the order of 0.01% of the
injected dose per gram of tumor,2 corresponding to a maximal intratumoral Ab concentration of approximately 100 nM, in agreement
with that seen in human xenografts in mice.3–5
Recent advancements in protein engineering are bringing drug
developers nearer to overcoming the barriers to developing Abs against solid tumors. Researchers can now create customized Ab-based
molecules with optimized molecular size, valence, charge, and affinity.
The primary building blocks of Ab-based molecules are Fab
fragments (55 kDa) and single-chain Fv (scFV; 25 kDa),6,7 both of

which can be used alone or as units of larger protein
constructs. Fab fragments, obtained by proteolytic
digestion of IgG, include a single Ab light chain
linked by a disulfide bond to a heavy chain fragment
consisting of the variable region and the first heavy
chain constant region, and form a single Ag binding
site from the noncovalent association of heavy chain
and light chain variable regions. (Fab)2 fragments
retain the heavy chain hinge region and are bivalent.
Single-chain Fv (scFv) are single polypeptide chains
incorporating a heavy chain variable and a light
chain variable region, with a polypeptide linker. The
heavy and light chain regions from the same chain
form a single Ab-binding site. scFv molecules can also
be engineered to incorporate a carboxy terminal cysteine residue, thereby enabling formation of a (scFv)2
fragment by virtue of disulfide bridging.6,7 Another bivalent molecule is a ‘‘diabody,’’ which is formed from
2 scFvs linked noncovalently. Each of 2 Ag-binding
sites is formed from the heavy chain variable region
of 1 chain and the light chain variable region of the
other, with extensive noncovalent interaction.
Diabodies have rigid, compact structures, resulting in a separation of the 2 binding sites by 65 Å,
less than half the separation of the Ag binding sites
within an IgG. As such, they may be ideal for bridging between cells.8 A further possibility is a
‘‘minibody,’’ in which 2 scFv fragments are linked by
a component of the heavy-chain region (for example,
CH3), resulting in a bivalent molecule.9
Antibodies attack tumors by 3 general mechanisms1,10: 1) opsonization, which triggers killing by
immune cells, 2) modification of innate biological
processes such as growth and apoptosis, and 3)
delivery of a cytotoxic payload such as a chemotherapy drug, catalytic toxin, radioisotope, or enzyme.
Regardless of the mechanism, unless the Ab is directed at soluble factors in the bloodstream or at tumor
vascular endothelium, is conjugated to a radioisotope
with a long path length, or works primarily in conjunction with immune effector cells at the periphery
of the tumor, a necessary first step is penetration of
the Ab into tumor tissue and binding to the target.
In many cases optimal antigrowth effects are not
achieved if binding is restricted to the periphery of
the tumor.11 Rather, the Ab must gain access to all
viable cells within tumors at sufficient concentrations to effect a maximal change in the tumor.
The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework for capitalizing on recent scientific
advancements that can promote tumor exposure. The
focus is on 2 particular properties: 1) physical properties that enable penetration of and retention by
tumors, and 2) favorable plasma pharmacokinetics.

Physical Properties Governing Tumor Penetration
and Retention
Biological properties of solid tumors
Several barriers to transport exist within solid
tumors. Solid tumors differ from normal tissue with
regard to vasculature, interstitial fluid pressure, cell
density, tissue structure and composition, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components.12 Compared with
normal tissue ECM, tumor ECM is richer in collagen,
the primary determinant of tissue resistance to macromolecular transport, and is stiffer.13 Measurements
within murine solid tumors showed that macromolecular diffusion slowed 2-fold within 200 mm of the
surface of the tumor, and more than 10-fold beyond
500 mm, correlating with increasing density of ECM
and tighter collagen organization near the core of the
tumor.14 ECM composition differs among tumor types13,15 and can also change in response to radiation
therapy.16
Tumor vasculature differs from that of normal
tissues in that tumor blood vessels generally are
more heterogeneous in distribution, more tortuous,
larger in size, and more permeable.17,18 Tumor blood
supplies have high viscosity, due to cells and large
molecules drained from the interstitium,12 resulting,
together with vessel tortuosity, in greater blood flow
resistance and lower blood flow relative to normal
tissues.19
Vascularity is an important determinant of tumor
biodistribution of Abs. In order to uniformly penetrate a tumor, an Ab or fragment must penetrate half
the distance to the nearest vessel. Average intervessel
distances range from 40 to 100 microns.20,21 However, in areas of anatomic hypoperfusion individual
intervessel distances can range up to as high as 1
mm to 1 cm.22 In addition, areas of functional hypoperfusion can exist due to local elevations in interstitial pressure.23 Because diffusion distance is proportional only to the square root of time, diffusion of
an IgG across half a centimeter into such a region of
hypoperfusion could take weeks to months. Diffusion
of a smaller fragment such as scFv into this space
could be 2–6-fold faster but could still take up to a
month. The therapeutic relevance of penetrating
these extremely hypoperfused areas depends on
whether they contain viable tumor cells despite the
hypoperfusion.
In solid tumors, large particles such as tumor
cells commonly enter lymphatic capillaries, impairing lymphatic drainage12 and decreasing the clearance of high molecular weight compounds from the
tumor interstitium. This decrease in clearance, coupled with leakiness of the microvasculature, results in
a tendency for macromolecules greater than 45 kDa

172

to be retained in solid tumors, a phenomenon termed
‘‘enhanced permeability and retention’’ (EPR).24
Retention of macromolecules elevates oncotic
pressure, in turn drawing water into the tumor interstitium25 and raising interstitial pressure compared
with normal tissues. Interstitial fluid pressure is elevated uniformly throughout a tumor and drops precipitously to normal values in the tumor’s periphery
or in the immediately surrounding tissue.26 Elevated
interstitial pressure correlates with increased tumor
size, decreased oxygenation, and decreased radiosensitivity.27–29 Macromolecules must diffuse against this
pressure gradient to penetrate tumors.
Because tumor size affects both the distance,
which Abs and their fragments must diffuse to uniformly penetrate, as well as the interstitial pressure,
which sets up convection currents unfavorable to
penetration, larger tumor masses may be more difficult to treat with monoclonal Ab therapies. A study
in colorectal patients with tumors of varying sizes,
utilizing radiolabeled anti-CEA Mab, showed that the
tumor penetration in percent injected dose per gram
of tumor was proportional to the reciprocal of the tumor mass to the 0.362 power—i.e., approximately inversely proportional to the tumor diameter.30

Physical Properties of Ab Constructs
That Favor Tumor Exposure
Subsequent to extravascularization, an anticancer
agent must reach its binding sites on tumor cells.
The agent would then ideally fully penetrate the tumor to maximize potential therapeutic efficacy. A
strong molecular attraction tends to compete with
tumor penetration because the agent can get stuck at
the periphery. Moreover, the ability to rapidly penetrate deep into a tumor mass is often associated with
suboptimal retention within the tumor. In designing
antitumor constructs, a suitable balance must be
found between properties that promote tumor penetration and those that promote tumor retention.
The transport of macromolecules in normal tissues is frequently by convection,25 which is governed
by hydraulic conductivity and pressure differences.
However, within tumors, elevated and uniform interstitial pressure limits convection, and diffusion plays
a prominent role in transport.15 To achieve favorable
tumor exposure, it is important to optimize diffusion.
A major determinant of speed of diffusion
through tumors is molecular size.15,20,22 The rate of
diffusion is inversely proportional to the molecular
radius, or approximately to the cube root of molecular weight.20,21 scFv fragments diffuse approximately
6 times faster than IgG, due to their smaller size and
other factors.31

Molecular charge and shape also affect tumor
distribution. Because of its elongated shape and
charge characteristics, IgG diffuses more slowly than
dextrans of a similar molecular weight22 and, indeed,
the interstitial volume accessible for diffusion of an
IgG is approximately one-third that of an scFv.32 An
analysis of 13 derivatives of scFv showed that the
molecules with isoelectric points between 5 and 9
had superior tumor penetration relative to those outside this range.33 These results led to the hypothesis
that therapeutic proteins with isoelectric points
below 5 or above 9 are prone to immobilization by
electrostatic interactions with the vascular endothelium and/or extracellular matrix.33
Affinity for the target antigen (Ag) is an important
variable affecting tumor distribution. Whereas one
might presume that tighter binding is better, modeling
by Weinstein and van Osdol34 showed that tighter
binding tends to result in increased retention of Ab at
the periphery of 0.3-mm tumor nodules. The term
‘‘binding site barrier’’ was coined to describe the phenomenon of high-affinity Abs getting stuck at the tumor periphery.35
Originally, the idea that Ab affinity could increase
beyond an optimum seemed counterintuitive, but it
was subsequently confirmed experimentally by Adams
et al.,4,5 who prepared a series of radiolabeled mutant
scFvs that bound to an identical HER2/neu epitope,
but with varying affinity from 107 to 1011 M, and
studied their biodistributions in SCID mice bearing 1
mm human ovarian tumor xenografts. Biodistribution
into the tumor, plasma, and normal tissues was evaluated and immunohistochemistry assessed uniformity
of tumor penetration. The studies were done both in
normal mice and in mice rendered anephric for 48
hours to prolong the serum half-life of the scFv.
Peak tumor: normal organ ratios and maximum
tumor retentions of label were obtained with the 109
M kD affinity variant. Lower dissociation constants
(1010 to 1011 M) resulted in equal tumor accumulation but less selectivity for targeting tumors. The most
uniform intratumoral distribution was achieved with
the scFv possessing the highest dissociation constant,
107 M. Intratumoral distribution became more uniform with more time for equilibration by rendering
the mouse anephric for 24 hours compared with the
normal scFv half-life in mice of 3.5 hours. Thus, homogeneity of tumor penetration was optimal at a lower affinity than the affinity associated with the best
tumor retention and selectivity.4 In interpreting these
results, one must bear in mind that radioiodinated
antibodies can suffer hydrolysis of the label upon cellular internalization,36 which may occur to a greater
extent with a higher-affinity antibody.

Ab Engineering for Solid Tumor Exposure/Beckman et al.

To address the question of optimal affinity, Graff
and Wittrup31 modeled successive penetration of
layers of 100-mm tumor spheroids in the setting of
Ab excess. Using parameters derived from the literature their simulations were in qualitative and quantitative agreement with a variety of experimental datasets including kinetics and dose dependence of Ab
uptake into spheroids37–42 and biodistribution of Abs
and Ab fragments into tumor xenografts as a function of affinity, molecular weight, and elimination
half-life.4,43–45
During an initial loading phase, intratumoral diffusion competes with systemic clearance, and bound
Ab moves toward the tumor core, whereas the concentration of free Ab at the tumor surface remains
high. Low-affinity Abs penetrate more deeply into
the tumor than high-affinity Abs. Penetration of the
spheroids is proportional to the free diffusion rate
and to the surrounding plasma area under the curve
(AUC), according to the model.
In the model’s second, or retention, phase, Ag
internalization or shedding depletes Ag-Ab complexes, in competition with Ag-Ab dissociation. Internalization may be associated with antitumor effect,
either by cellular internalization of a toxic moiety
conjugated to the Ab, or by elimination of the Ag as
a cellular signaling receptor. As the affinity increases,
more Ag-Ab complexes will internalize. Maximal tumor retention and exposure require Ag-Ab dissociation rates equal to or less than elimination/internalization rates, so as not to compete with this process. This corresponds to a Kd of 109 to 1010 M for
a construct with a metabolic half-life of 1 day, or to a
weaker Kd for more rapidly internalizing Ags.
Jain and Baxter23,46 also modeled the effect of
binding, concluding that higher affinity Abs have
slower penetration but increased retention. They further demonstrated that in Ab excess higher affinity is
better, but in Ag excess high affinity Abs can be stuck
at the periphery.
Thus, the optimal binding affinity balances 2
goals: 1) sufficiently rapid diffusion to enable penetration into the core of the tumor, and 2) sufficiently
long retention to enable signaling inhibition, internalization, or other events required for a pharmacodynamic effect. Overall, the optimal Kd is governed not
only by characteristics of the Ab, but by the Ag and
by the requirements for therapeutic efficacy as well.
Experimental results are consistent with these
theoretical principles. Yokota et al.50 tested the efficacy of 3 radiolabeled Abs with affinities varying from
4  1010 to 4  1011 M in a murine xenograft model.
The tighter binding Abs were more potent and more
efficacious. However, the initial tumors were small,

173

about 30 mm3, and given that the attached I-131 has a
radiation pathlength on the order of 1-2 mm, not much
penetration would have been required.
Adams et al.4 demonstrated that there was an affinity optimum for scFv, and higher affinities beyond
the optimum resulted in inhomogeneous tumor
penetration and decreased tumor/normal tissue selectivity.
Blumenthal47 investigated the effect of total Ab
dose and tumor size on uniformity of biodistribution
using radiolabeled IgG1 of affinities from 108 to
109 M in xenografts varying in size from 0.25 to 1.5 g.
Total Ag measurements by immunoassay suggested
an intratumoral Ag concentration of 107 M and
that, at a total Ab dose of 400–500 mg, Ag and Ab
were present at 1:1 stoichiometry within the tumor.
Doses of up to 800 mg were utilized, which is 7-fold
higher on a molar basis than used by Adams et al.4
The IgG would have a half-life of about 100 hours in
mice.48 The higher doses resulted in improved homogeneity of distribution in most cases, although distribution was still heterogeneous in the larger tumors
using the higher-affinity Abs. This study suggests that
if dosing to Ab excess can be achieved, the ‘‘binding
site barrier’’ may be overcome, although slow diffusion is still an issue for IgG in larger tumor masses.
Verel et al.49 compared tumor biodistribution
and radiotherapy efficacy of a series of 5 IgG1 Abs,
with kDs ranging from 108 to 1010 M in a xenograft
model. The lower-affinity Abs demonstrated increased tumor accumulation and radiotherapy efficacy for 100 mm3 tumors at the very low dose used
(20 mg), 40-fold lower than in the Blumenthal47 study.
From the above experimental and theoretical
studies, it is clear that the optimal affinity for an AgAb complex depends on a variety of factors, including the intervessel distance over which diffusion is
required, the size of the construct, the plasma AUC
over single and repeat dosing, the target Ag density,
the relative intratumoral stoichiometry of Ag and Ab,
and the complex dissociation rate relative to rates of
Ag dissociation, elimination, and/or internalization.
In general, the studies with higher Ab exposure and
smaller tumors demonstrate tighter affinities at the
optimum than those with larger tumors or lesser
total Ab exposure. Plasma concentrations from clinical doses of trastuzumab (Herceptin) are about
1 mM, more comparable to that achieved in the Blumenthal study,47 than the lower concentrations considered in the other studies by Verel,49 Adams et al.,4,5
or the theoretical study that raised the binding site
barrier question.35
A variety of Ab constructs have been investigated
as alternatives to full Abs for diagnostic and thera-

174

peutic applications, exploiting the importance of molecular size in tumor biodistribution, as discussed
above, and additionally exploring the role of multivalent constructs. These alternatives include Fab and
Fab20 fragments; scFv constructs, both monovalent
and multivalent (diabodies, triabodies, and tetrabodies); minibodies (i.e., scFv-CH3 dimers); bispecific
Abs; and camel variable functional heavy chain
domains. In general, lower molecular weight constructs penetrate more quickly into tumors but have
shorter and lower overall retention. Increased valence
generally increases tumor uptake and specificity.
Thus, several groups50,51 demonstrated rapid tumor uptake and plasma clearance of scFvs in a murine xenograft system, as well as more homogeneous
penetration of the tumor compared with larger
forms. This was also true for variable domains from
camel-derived heavy chains, at 15 kDa the smallest
known Ag-binding fragment.52 Smaller constructs
such as scFv, diabodies, triabodies, minibodies, and
Fab have been shown in xenograft systems to have
shorter half-lives and higher tumor-to-organ ratios,
but lower overall tumor uptake at long times compared with corresponding Fab0 2 constructs.53,54 Liu
et al.55 demonstrated superior tumor uptake of an
Fab compared with the parent Ab in a xenograft
model during a 3–14-hour time window suggesting
applicability for imaging, whereas Sundaresan et al.56
reached similar conclusions for minibodies and diabodies. Holton et al. and Covell et al.57,58 systematically compared biodistribution of mAbs with the
corresponding Fab and Fab20 constructs, both for
binding Abs and nonspecific Abs.
Several groups have examined the effect of
increased valence. Adams et al.5 showed that a diabody possessed significantly improved in vivo tumor
retention compared with its corresponding scFv
monomer. Nielsen et al.59 created bivalent diabodies
from scFv ranging in affinity from 107 to 109 M,
targeted to the same epitope. These bivalent diabodies possessed affinities with a much narrower range
of 6  109 to 3  1010 M. Tumor retention was
improved by conversion to the diabody format, and
optimal tumor biodistribution was seen for the weakest-binding diabody, again demonstrating that
increases in affinity and avidity beyond the optimum
may have little utility. Adams et al.60 compared scFv
dimers with 1 and 2 Ag-specific binding sites to the
parent scFv, and showed that the enhanced tumor
retention of such dimeric Abs in a murine xenograft
model compared with scFv is due to increased valence, not to increased molecular weight. However,
both of these constructs are below the 60-kDa glomerular filtration threshold, and thus are consider-

ably smaller than IgG molecules. Rossi et al.61 show
in a xenograft system that tetrabodies have higher
tumor uptake than the corresponding triabodies or
diabodies. Chauhan et al.62 compared diabodies and
tetrabodies to monovalent scFv in xenografts and
found that the multivalent constructs had 3–4-fold
higher tumor uptake and 6–8-fold lower renal uptake.
In contrast, little difference was seen in the biodistribution between monovalent and divalent constructs
of variable domains from camel functional heavy
chains.51 Storto et al.63 found in patients with hepatic
metastases from colorectal cancer that a trivalent
Fab0 3 construct had comparable tumor uptake and
tumor:blood ratios to the parent mAb.
Bivalent Ab constructs may be either monospecific or bispecific. Gruaz-Guyon et al.64 noted enhanced
tumor targeting by bispecific Abs in a pretargeted
radioimmunotherapy strategy. Renner et al.65 found
similar biodistribution of a bispecific anti-CD16/antiCD30 mAb compared with a monospecific anti-CD30
mAb. The bispecific Ab had previously shown a 30%
response rate in Hodgkin lymphoma patients resistant to standard therapy.
Clearly, tumor penetration requires sufficient serum exposure. Below we consider factors that influence serum pharmacokinetics.

Pharmacokinetic Considerations
Systemic clearance
Because of their large size, IgGs are resistant to filtration by the kidney and urinary elimination is negligible. Ab fragments such as Fab and Fv are sufficiently
small to undergo glomerular filtration. However,
because of the highly efficient mechanisms for recycling amino acids, the majority of the filtered proteins are reabsorbed rather than passed into the
urine. With the exception of IgA (which is subject to
a minor extent of biliary excretion), immunoglobulins are generally not eliminated in the feces.66
The receptor FcRn (neonatal receptor or Brambell receptor), binds to the Fc portion of Abs and
plays a major role in clearance of IgG from the circulation.67,68 FcRn is expressed in cells in close contact
with serum. Most serum proteins are pinocytosed
and undergo gradual acidification in endosomes, followed by fusion with lysosomes and hydrolysis. However, IgGs bind to FcRn at low pH and the complex
is carried back to the cell surface, whereupon it dissociates at neutral pH. FcRn therefore serves as a
protective carrier that shuttles IgG away from the lysosome and back into the serum.
Endogenous human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 all have
high affinities for FcRn, and these high affinities
largely account for the 3-week circulating half-lives

Ab Engineering for Solid Tumor Exposure/Beckman et al.

for these isotypes. Human IgG3, which has relatively
low affinity for FcRn, has a shorter half-life (1 week).
Murine Abs have low affinity for human FcRn and a
much shorter serum half-life in humans.69,70 Mutation of specific amino acids in the CH2 or CH3 domain of Fc alters affinity for FcRn, in turn altering an
Ab’s serum half-life.67,71
Interactions with the target Ag are important to
Ab clearance.72 Many therapeutic Abs demonstrate
rapid clearance when their serum concentrations fall
below a threshold concentration, corresponding to
the point of equal amounts of Ab and target.73–75

Volumes of distribution
After intravenous administration, mAbs initially distribute into a volume roughly equal to the plasma
volume (0.045 L/kg)3,73,76 and on approaching steady
state the volume of distribution increases to approximately 0.1 L/kg, reflecting only limited extravascular
distribution.77–79 Biodistribution studies in animals
lacking the target Ag have shown that the largest percentage of the dose of mAb is in the plasma and
that whole-body distribution predominantly targets
organs that are highly perfused with blood.80–82 In
murine xenograft models, mAbs directed against tumor-specific Ags still largely remain in the blood; no
more than 20% of the administered dose typically
associates with the tumor.2,83
The limited extravascular distribution of Abs
reflects limited extravasation in normal tissues and
elevated interstitial pressure in tumor tissues, as
alluded to above. One strategy to promoting vascular
penetration into solid tumors exploits surface molecules expressed on tumor vascular endothelia.84,85 In
1 case, an Ab directed against an endothelial cell surface protein, annexin A1, determined by subtractive
proteomics to be specific to solid tumor vascular endothelium, enabled efficient tumor targeting via
specialized vascular endothelial structures called
caveolae. Caveolae are invaginations of the plasma
membrane of endothelial cells, rich in the membrane
protein caveolin, through which ‘‘transcytosis’’ of
macromolecules from the vascular compartment to
the interstitium may occur.86
Excretion of novel Ab constructs
Molecular size of Ab-based molecules is an important determinant of renal excretion. The T1/2 of a
protein molecule correlates with its size relative to
the threshold for glomerular filtration, which is estimated to be approximately 60 kDa.87 Whereas intact
IgG molecules (150 kDa) are too large to be filtered
by the kidneys, smaller constructs may be subject to
extensive renal clearance, resulting in shorter half-

175

lives. For example; small scFv fragments (30 kDa)
have T1/2 values in the range of 2 hours.83

Current Perspectives, Challenges, and Future Directions
Optimizing biodistribution properties of Ab constructs depends on a large number of host and tumor variables. These include: the density and
distribution of target Ag in tumors and normal tissues; the degree of target occupancy and residence
time required for tumor cell kill; possible toxicities
from normal tissue distribution; tumor size and vascularity; tumor interstitial pressure, convection, and
diffusion; and metabolism and internalization rates
for Ag-Ab constructs.
An equally large number of Ab construct and
therapy variables are available for optimization,
including size, charge, and valence; constant region
type and glycosylation pattern; presence or absence of
a radioisotope or a toxic moiety; dose, route, and
schedule of administration; and use of a traditional or
of a pretargeting strategy. Given the complexity of the
problem, systematic preclinical programs may enhance the likelihood of success in subsequent clinical
studies. Such preclinical investigations should integrate both experimental and theoretical approaches.
Preclinical studies of a putative Ab-based therapeutic agent can encompass a variety of constructs,
differing in molecular weight, affinity, valence, and/
or other features of interest, which bind to the same
epitope as demonstrated by competition experiments. The Ag density and target affinities should be
known for both tumor cell and cross-reacting normal
tissues, and the percent target occupancy and
required residence time for tumor cell kill should
ideally be estimated in vitro. Similarly, rate constants
for Ab-Ag internalization should be determined, if
applicable. Dose and schedule should be varied and
antitumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, overall biodistribution, homogeneity of intratumoral distribution,
and tumor microvessel density and distribution ideally should be measured in tumor-bearing animals
with a variety of tumor sizes. Many of these features
have been present in the work reviewed above, and
they have shed light not only on specific applications
but also on general principles.
Studies in tumor-bearing rodents are often confounded by lack of normal tissue reactivity with Ab
constructs directed toward human Ags, but studies in
transgenic animals can be performed in some
instances to alleviate this issue. For example, CEAtransgenic mice were used to test anti-CEA mAbs
and revealed specific accumulation in normal gastrointestinal mucosa as well as in adenomas and
tumors.88,89

Theoretical models may help to understand and
interpret experimental results, to prioritize further
experimental work, and to translate experiments in
murine systems to humans. Baxter et al.90,91 developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model
that included tumor, interstitial, plasma, and a variety of organ compartments. The model accounted
for transcapillary transport and specific and nonspecific binding, but not for heterogeneity of tumor biodistribution. Adjustable parameters were determined
from work with a nonspecific IgG and then carried
over to specific Ab constructs with good agreement
with experimental data in mice. Importantly, it was
feasible to scale up the predictions from mouse to
human, taking some adjustable parameters from the
literature, other parameters directly from the mouse,
and others from the mouse by allometric scaling.
Agreement with human data was qualitatively good
for a variety of Ab constructs, although the largest
discrepancies involved distribution into the tumor.
In optimizing Ag-Ab constructs for affinity and
other properties it is well to bear in mind the mechanism of cell kill, and the requirements in terms of
percent occupancy of target sites and residence
times required to effect killing. If a high percentage
occupancy and long residence time are required for
cell kill, high affinity may be preferable and the
approach would have to be to treat the outer layer of
the tumor with each course, ‘‘peeling the onion’’ step
by step. Tumors are genetically unstable, however,
and if antibody therapies take too long to penetrate
them, may acquire resistance.92 Conjugates of Abs
with toxins or chemotherapy must have a sufficient
residence time to internalize, but depending on the
potency of the toxin or chemotherapy, may require
that residence time for only a small percentage of
receptors. When only brief residence time or low percentage occupancy is required for cell kill, a loweraffinity Ab might enhance uniformity of tumor penetration. Radioimmunotherapy is a special case in that only
a brief residence time may be required but the path
length of the radiation may enhance the effective tumor penetration. Similarly, Abs which bind to circulating soluble factors, to the vascular endothelium, to the
extracellular matrix, or to immune effector cells, may
not need to penetrate the tumor to the same extent.
In summary, we suggest the following algorithm,
supported in each case by preclinical experimental
and theoretical studies, and if possible clinical biodistribution studies, when designing an Ab construct
and dosing schedule:

cell surface, on the extracellular matrix, on immune
effector cells, or on circulating factors, and to what
extent its effect is extended by bystander effects or radiation path-length if the antibody is to be radiolabeled.
Radiolabeled antibodies and those acting on circulating
factors or immune complexes may not need to penetrate
tumors to the same extent. The answer to this question
determines the applicability of Questions 3 and 4.
2. Determine the extent and duration of receptor occupancy that are required to achieve the desired pharmacodynamic effects. The affinity or avidity for the target
must be sufficient to achieve this goal, irrespective of
other considerations. Once this minimal affinity is
achieved, further increases in affinity must be balanced
against possible reductions in homogeneous tumor penetration. These considerations apply in settings of Ag
excess. If Ab excess can be achieved, all binding sites can
be saturated. Determining whether the situation reflects
Ag excess or Ab excess requires knowledge of the target
density on tumor and other cells as well as the pharmacokinetics of the Ab. Radiolabeled antibodies may require
much lower receptor occupancy in that they can achieve
cytotoxicity at a distance determined by their radiation
pathlength.
3. Ab constructs should have isoelectric points near physiologic pH if they are required to diffuse through the extracellular matrix or penetrate into tumors (see Question 1),
as molecules with neutral charge diffuse more readily.
4. If tumor penetration is required (see Question 1), consider smaller Ab constructs that diffuse more readily into
the tumor, enhancing their tumor-specific retention by
increasing their valence, as may be achieved with such
constructs as diabodies. Smaller constructs that are
below the 60-kDa threshold for glomerular filtration will
be more rapidly excreted if they are not retained in the
tumor, particularly if they do not have an Fc portion enabling recycling through the FcRn receptor. As long as tumor retention is sufficient, however, rapid excretion may
lead to reduced normal tissue binding, and hence
reduced toxicity.

These principles should prove useful in guiding
the development of Abs for cancer therapy.
