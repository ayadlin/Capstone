Abstract
Previous evidence showed the ability of the quinazoline-based
A1-adrenoreceptor antagonist doxazosin to suppress prostate
tumor growth via apoptosis. In this study, we carried out
structural optimization of the chemical nucleus of doxazosin
and a subsequent structure-function analysis toward the
development of a novel class of apoptosis-inducing and
angiogenesis-targeting agents. Our lead compound, DZ-50,
was effective at reducing endothelial cell viability via a
nonapoptotic mechanism. Treatment with DZ-50 effectively
prevented in vitro tube formation and in vivo chorioallantoic
membrane vessel development. Confocal microscopy revealed
a significantly reduced ability of tumor cells to attach to
extracellular matrix and migrate through endothelial cells in
the presence of DZ-50. In vivo tumorigenicty studies using
two androgen-independent human prostate cancer xenografts, PC-3 and DU-145, showed that DZ-50 treatment leads
to significant suppression of tumorigenic growth. Exposure
to the drug at the time of tumor cell inoculation led to
prevention of prostate cancer initiation. Furthermore, DZ-50
resulted in a reduced formation of prostate-tumor derived
metastatic lesions to the lungs in an in vivo spontaneous
metastasis assay. Thus, our drug discovery approach led to the
development of a class of lead (quinazoline-based) compounds with higher potency than doxazosin in suppressing
prostate growth by targeting tissue vascularity. This new class
of quinazoline-based compounds provides considerable promise as antitumor drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11344–52]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is a major contributor to cancer mortality in
American males, causing the death of f30,000 men in 2006 (1).
Therapeutic modalities such as radical prostatectomy and
radiotherapy are considered curative for localized disease, yet
no treatments for metastatic prostate cancer are available that
significantly increases patient survival (2). Clinical and experimental evidence implicates two components as contributors
toward the emergence of the androgen-independent phenotype:
activation of survival (apoptosis suppression) pathways and
increased tumor neovascularization (3, 4). Consequently, targeting
of apoptotic players is of vital therapeutic significance because

resistance to apoptosis is not only critical in conferring
therapeutic failure to standard treatment strategies but anoikis
[cell death on detachment from extracellular matrix (ECM)] also
plays an important role in angiogenesis and metastasis of
malignant cells (5, 6).
Angiogenesis is critical in tumor progression and metastasis
because a functional vascular supply is required for the continued
growth of solid tumors and the spread of cancer cells (7). Small
nongrowing tumors may remain dormant for years and the
angiogenic switch to aggressive metastatic phenotype involves a
change in the local equilibrium between factors inducing blood
vessel formation and those inhibiting the process (8, 9). During
angiogenesis, cells are in a dynamic state, lacking firm attachment
to the ECM, and exceedingly vulnerable to anoikis. Consequently,
targeting tumor endothelial cell survival by triggering anoikis may
provide a molecular basis for novel therapeutic strategies for
metastatic prostate cancer. Two classes of angiogenesis-targeting
agents consequently emerge: those preventing the development of
neovasculature of tumors (via inducing apoptosis and/or inhibiting
cell proliferation and migration) and those that directly target the
existing tumor vasculature (via anoikis of tumor endothelial and
epithelial cells; refs. 10, 11).
The quinazoline-based compounds doxazosin and terazosin are
known a1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, which are clinically effective for the relief of benign prostate hyperplasia symptoms via
their ability to selectively antagonize the a1a-adrenoreceptors,
which are distributed in the bladder neck and prostate gland (12).
Recent experimental and clinical evidence, however, documented
additional antigrowth effects by the quinazoline-based adrenoreceptor antagonists, with induction of prostate epithelial and
smooth muscle cell apoptosis as one of the molecular mechanisms contributing to their overall long-term clinical efficacy
in benign prostate hyperplasia patients (13, 14). Suppression of
prostate tumor growth by these drugs proceeds via an a1adrenoreceptor–independent mechanism, mediated by transforming growth factor-h1 (TGF-h1) apoptotic signaling (15, 16),
receptor-mediated apoptosis involving death-inducing signaling
complex formation and caspase-8 activity (17), and inhibition of
Akt activation (17, 18).
The separation of the effect of doxazosin on cancer cell
apoptosis from its original pharmacologic activity in vascular cells
provides an intriguing molecular basis to develop a novel class of
apoptosis-inducing agents through lead optimization. Our recent
pharmacologic exploitation of the quinazoline nucleus of doxazosin led to the development of novel compounds with and without
the characteristic ‘‘classic’’ apoptotic activity but exhibiting potent
antivascular activity (18). In this study, we report the targeting by
the new lead quinazoline-based compounds of prostate tumor
epithelial and endothelial cell survival, migration, neovascularization, and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

chorioallantoic membrane was quantified by counting under a dissecting
microscope.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Reagents
The androgen-independent human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145
cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection
and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Invitrogen) and antibiotics. The human benign prostatic epithelial
cell line BPH-1 (a gift from Dr. Simon W. Hayward, Department of
Urological Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN)
was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and
antibiotics. Human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human lung
microvascular endothelial cells-lung (HMVEC-L) were cultured in endothelial medium (EGM-2; Cambrex) supplemented with EGM-2 and EGM2MV (Cambrex). Recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) was purchased from Landing Biotech. Doxazosin derivatives
(DZ-1-23, DZ-38, DZ-40, DZ-42, and DZ-50) were synthesized as described
previously (18).

Apoptosis and Cell Viability Evaluation

Hoechst staining. Cells were plated in six-well culture dishes at 5  104
per well and, at subconfluency, were treated with increasing concentrations
of DZ-1-23, DZ-38, DZ-40, DZ-42, and DZ-50 (0–25 Amol/L). After 24 and
48 h of treatment, cells were fixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde
(Sigma) and stained with 10 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 (B2261; Sigma) in the
presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) as previously described. Cells were
visualized under a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescent microscope with a UV
filter (365 nm), and cells with condensed chromatin were designated
apoptotic (100 magnification). The apoptotic index was determined by
counting three random fields in duplicate wells per group. Each experiment
was done twice.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
Subconfluent cultures of cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of
DZ-1-23, DZ-38, DZ-40, DZ-42, and DZ-50 (0–25 Amol/L). After treatment,
the medium was replaced with 250 AL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma; 1 mg/mL) and incubated at
37jC to form blue crystals. After 2 h, the MTT was removed and replaced
with DMSO (250 AL) and incubated overnight at 37jC. The DMSO-crystal
solution absorbance was read at 540 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments). Numerical data represent the average of three independent
experiments done in triplicate.
Cell migration assay (wounding assay). Confluent monolayers of PC-3,
DU-145, HUVEC, or HMVEC-L cells were wounded with a toothpick. After
wounding, medium was changed to DZ-3 or DZ-50 (5 Amol/L). After
incubation for 12 or 24 h, wounding areas were examined by light
microscopy (Axiovert 10, Zeiss). Cells that had migrated to the wounded
areas were counted under a microscope for quantification of cell migration.
Migration was calculated as the average number of cells observed in five
random high-power (400) wounded fields per well in duplicate wells.
Tube formation assay: in vitro angiogenesis evaluation. In vitro
formation of tubular structures was studied on ECM with an angiogenesis
kit as described by the manufacturer (Chemicon International, Inc.).
HUVEC or HMVEC-L (10  104 per well) in 96-well plates were seeded onto
ECMatrigel-coated wells in the presence or absence of DZ-3 or DZ-50 and
VEGF. Cells were treated with cytokines as single agents or in combination
(e.g., DZ-50 and VEGF). Twenty-four hours after treatment, angiogenesis
was assessed on the basis of formation of capillary-like structures of HUVEC
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The capillary-like tubes were
counted (Nikon Eclipse, TE2000-U) in each well.

Chicken Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay
Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated at 37jC. At E8, a window was
created to allow visualization of the egg shell membrane. Blank paper discs
(6 mm; Becton Dickinson) were placed on the egg shell membrane along
with VEGF (100 ng) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 100 ng) and
DZ-50. The windows were sealed with porous adhesive and allowed to
incubate for 48 h. At E10, the adhesive was removed along with the egg shell
membrane to expose the chorioallantoic membrane and 4% paraformaldehyde was added. Following excision, the number of vessels per

Cell Attachment Assay
Prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145 cells were treated for 3, 6, 9, 12, or
15 h with DZ-50 (5 Amol/L) and harvested. Cells (5  104) were added to
each well of a six-well culture dish coated with either collagen or fibronectin
and incubated for 30 min at 37jC. Following incubation, cells were fixed
and the number of cells per well was recorded. Numerical data represent
the average of three independent experiments in triplicate.

Transendothelial Migration Assay
Sterile (12-mm diameter) glass coverslips were coated with Matrigel
(Becton Dickinson) at a dilution of 1:8 and air-dried at room temperature
(1 h). Coverslips received f6.25  104 HMVEC-L to form a complete
monolayer. The cells were allowed to spread on the Matrigel for 24 h before
the experiment. PC-3 cells were resuspended in EGM-2MV (Cambrex) and
added to the HMVEC-L monolayer at a concentration of 8  103 per
coverslip. Cocultures were incubated at 37jC at 5% CO2 for 3, 6, 9, 12, and
24 h. Before the addition of prostate epithelial cells, cells were incubated
with the lipophilic tracer 1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3¶,3¶-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Invitrogen) at 10 Ag/mL for 20 min to stain cell
membranes. To label F-actin, PC-3 cells, or cocultures of PC-3 cells,
HMVEC-L were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and were permeabilized for 5 min with a buffer containing 15
mmol/L Tris, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L EGTA, and 0.5%
Triton X-100 (pH 7.4). Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with Alexa 488–conjugated phalloidin at a dilution of 1:50 in blocking
solution, followed by 5 min of incubation with 10 mmol/L Hoechst 33342
(Sigma) in PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories) on glass slides and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Western Blot Analysis
Cultures of PC-3, DU-145, BPH-1, HUVEC, and HMVEC-L cells were
treated with DZ-50 (10 Amol/L) for various time periods and cell lysates
were subsequently generated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
[150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1%
NP40 with 1 mmol/L phenyl methyl-sulfonyl fluoride]. The total protein
concentration in the lysates was quantified with BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce) and protein samples (30 Ag) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.).
After blocking with 5% dry milk in TBS-0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room
temperature, membranes were incubated overnight at 4jC with antibodies
against caspase-8, Akt, or phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling Technology).
Following incubation with the respective primary antibody, membranes
were exposed to species-specific horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary
antibodies. Signal detection was achieved with SuperSignal West Dura
Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) and visualized with a UVP Bioimaging
System (Upland). All bands were normalized to a-actin expression
(Oncogene Research Products).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting—(FACS) analysis. PC-3 cells were
treated with DZ-50 (10 Amol/L) and harvested with 0.5 mmol/L EDTA
solution. Prostate cancer epithelial cells were then incubated with HBSS
supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide for
30 min at 4jC. Cells were subsequently fixed in 4% (wt/vol) formaldehyde,
washed, and incubated with the designated integrin antibody followed by
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary. Flow-cytometry analysis was
done on a Partec FlowMax (Partec).
Tumorigenicity studies. Human prostate cells (PC-3 and DU-145)
suspended in PBS were inoculated s.c. (2.5  106 per site) in the flank of
male nude mice 4 to 6 weeks of age. Tumors were measured every 48 h with
a digital caliber, and tumor volumes were calculated using the following
formula: length  (width)2 / 2. When tumors reached 50 mm3, mice were
stratified into treatment groups of six mice per treatment. DZ-50 was
administered at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose
(wt/vol) + 0.1% Tween-80 (vol/vol) in water by oral gavage using a 22-gauge,
1.5-in. gavage needle. Animals were sacrificed after 2 weeks of treatment
unless otherwise indicated. In a separate experiment, human prostate cells

(PC-3) were inoculated as described above and dosing began (200 mg/kg)
concurrently for 2 weeks. On termination of the experiment, tumors were
surgically excised and tissue specimens were fixed in a 10% (vol/vol)
formalin solution (Sigma) and subsequently embedded in Paraplast X-tra
paraffin (VWR). Blocks were sectioned (6 Am) on a Finesse Microtome
(ThermoShandon).
Spontaneous metastasis assay. Human prostate cells (PC-3) were
injected (2  106/80 AL of PBS) in the tail vein of male nude mice 4 to
6 weeks of age; mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment. At
10 days postinoculation, 200 mg/kg DZ-50 was given daily (via oral gavage
as described above). After 2 weeks of treatment, DZ-50–treated and vehicle
control mice were sacrificed and lungs, spleen, kidneys, and prostate organs
were excised and subjected to examination for metastatic tumor lesions.
Apoptosis evaluation. Apoptotic cells were detected with the ApopTag
Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Kit (Chemicon). Briefly, paraffin-embedded
sections were treated with Proteinase K (DAKO) and were subsequently
incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme. Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)–
positive cells were counted in five different fields (400) and the apoptotic
index was determined based on the number of apoptotic cells over the total
number of cells.
Vascularity evaluation. CD31 staining was done for endothelial cells by
enzymatic digestion with Proteinase K (DAKO). The primary antibody used

was the mouse anti-human CD31 specific for endothelial cells from DAKO
(overnight incubation at 4jC). CD31-positive endothelial cells were counted
in five different fields (400).
Cell proliferation. Cell proliferation index was evaluated on the basis of
Ki67 nuclear antigen immunoreactivity. Following antigen retrieval, slides
were incubated with an antibody directed against the Ki67 nuclear antigen
(AMAC). Ki67+ cells were counted from five different fields (400).

Statistical Analysis
One-way ANOVA was done using the StatView statistical program to
determine the statistical significance between values. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
DZ-50 is effective at inducing cell death via a nonapoptotic
mechanism. Pharmacologic exploitation of the quinazoline nucleus
of doxazosin led to the development of several novel agents with
varying effects on apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Functional characterization of
these compounds revealed two classes of agents: those that are not
effective at inducing apoptosis but elicit their effects by an
alternative cell-death mechanism (DZ-50) and those that trigger

Figure 2. DZ-50 prevents cell migration and adhesion to ECM of human prostate tumor epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. A, wounding assays were
done on endothelial and epithelial cells and the number of migratory cells was quantified as described in Materials and Methods. There was a significant reduction in the
migratory capacity detected in the vascular endothelial and tumor epithelial cells analyzed (*, P < 0.0001; **, P < 0.001; ***, P = 0.004). B and C, DZ-50 partially inhibits
prostate tumor epithelial cell attachment to ECM components. The ability of PC-3 prostate cancer cells to adhere to ECM protein components was evaluated after
exposure to DZ-50 for 6, 9, and 12 h at concentrations of 5 and 10 Amol/L. Attached prostate cancer cells were counted on fibronectin- or collagen-coated culture dishes
(columns, mean; bars, SD). DZ-50 reduced the ability of PC-3 cells to attach to either fibronectin or collagen, but this effect was not statistically significant. D-I and
II, DZ-50 prevents prostate cancer epithelial cell adhesion to endothelial cells. Transendothelial migration assays were done to assess the ability of PC-3 prostate
cancer cells to attach and migrate through a monolayer of HMVEC-L following exposure to DZ-50. D-I, PC-3 cells were stained with the lipophilic tracer DiI (red ) and
were subsequently added to a confluent monolayer of HMVEC-L and exposed to DZ-50 for 3 and 9 h. DAPI staining identified the nuclei (blue ). Epithelial cell adhesion
to the endothelial cell monolayer was prevented following 9 h of exposure to the drug (10 Amol/L). Cell viability assays were done on PC-3 and HMVEC-L cells
treated with DZ-50 (10 Amol/L). No death was detected within the first 24 h of treatment, indicating that blocking of transendothelial tumor migration was not due to
drug-induced loss of cell viability (D-II ).

apoptotic cell death (DZ-3; Fig. 1A–C). The most intriguing
compound from the first category was DZ-50, which reduced cell
viability in a number of endothelial and epithelial cell lines at both
24 and 48 h without induction of classic apoptosis (Fig. 1D).
Anoikis effect of DZ-50: inhibition of cell migration and cell

led to a significant inhibition of migration of endothelial cells and

cancer cells to DZ-50 reduced cellular adhesion to the ECM

however, this failed to reach statistical significance. Attachment of
DU-145 prostate cancer cells to either fibronectin or collagen was
significantly inhibited by the drug treatment (Fig. 2C). Transendothelial migration assays were done to assess the ability of
PC-3 prostate cancer cells to migrate through an endothelial cell

Figure 3. DZ-50 prevents angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. A and B, in vitro angiogenesis is blocked following exposure to DZ-50. Endothelial cells were seeded in
Matrigel in the presence or absence of either DZ-50 or doxazosin at 10 Amol/L concentration and tube formation was visualized and quantified in the presence or

abrogated branch point formation. B, quantitative analysis of the data; a significant reduction in tube formation is detected in the presence of DZ-50 compared with
controls, whereas the novel quinazoline DZ-10 (no effect on cell viability-negative control) does not change the ability of HUVEC cells to form multibranched tubular
networks. VEGF cannot reverse the antiangiogenic effect of DZ-50. C and D, in vivo angiogenesis is blocked by DZ-50. Chorioallantoic membrane assays were

monolayer of HMVEC-L following exposure to DZ-50. PC-3 cells
were stained with the lipophilic tracer DiI (red) and subsequently
added to a confluent monolayer of HMVEC-L and exposed to DZ50 for 3 and 9 h (Fig. 2D). 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
staining identified the nuclei (blue). As shown in Fig. 2D, tumor
epithelial cell adhesion to the endothelial cell monolayer was
prevented following 9 h of exposure to the drug (10 Amol/L). There
was no effect on cell viability or cell death in either cell population
(PC-3 or HMVEC-L cells) in response to the drug DZ-50 (10 Amol/L)
within the first 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2D), indicating that the effect
on transendothelial tumor cell migration was not due to druginduced cell death.
We subsequently investigated the direct effect of our lead drug
DZ-50 on angiogenesis in vitro by the tube formation assay. As
shown in Fig. 3A and B, after treatment with DZ-50, vascular
endothelial cell tube formation was significantly inhibited.
Furthermore, exposure to DZ-50 led to a significant suppression
of angiogenesis or vascularity in the in vivo chorioallantoic
membrane blood vessel development assay (Fig. 3C and D).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

Simultaneous presence of a potent angiogenic factor, VEGF and/or
bFGF (data not shown), was not able to rescue the cells from the
antiangiogenic effect of DZ-50.
Reduction of integrin B1 surface expression by DZ-50. To
explore the potential mechanism underlying that action of DZ-50
against prostate tumor epithelial cells, analysis of the integrin
expression profile was done. PC-3 untreated control cells were
found to express integrin subunits a2, a3, aV, h1, and h3
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Exposure to DZ-50 did not affect the
surface expression of integrins a2, a3, aV, and h3 (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 4A, integrin h1 subunit was undetectable in cells
treated with DZ-50 for 12 to 24 h, compared with vehicle control
(Fig. 4A). DU-145 prostate cells exposed to DZ-50 exhibited a
significantly smaller shift in integrin h1 expression intensity
(Fig. 4B).
DZ-50 treatment suppresses prostate tumor growth in vivo.
To assess the ability of DZ-50 to suppress prostate cancer growth,
we subsequently investigated the in vivo antitumor efficacy in
human prostate cancer xenografts growing in nude mice. Our

initial toxicity studies revealed no change in the animal’s behavioral
pattern and weight (data not shown). Both gross and histologic
examination of lung, liver, spleen, and prostate showed no apparent
changes compared with control animals (data not shown). The
tumorigenicity studies showed a significant reduction in tumor
volume in both androgen-independent human prostate cancer
PC-3 and DU-145 tumor xenografts following treatment with DZ-50
(200 mg/kg; Fig. 5A and B). The efficacy of DZ-50 to hinder the
growth initiation of prostate tumors was examined by inoculation
of nude mice with PC-3 prostate cancer cells with simultaneous
treatment with DZ-50 (200 mg/kg). As shown in Fig. 5C, prostate
tumor development was dramatically suppressed with drug
exposure (2 weeks).
In situ detection of apoptosis in prostate tumors revealed no
significant change in the apoptotic index of DZ-50 of prostate
cancer xenografts from treated tumor-bearing mice compared
with control (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3), further verifying
that this compound does not induce apoptosis. Also shown in
Table 1 is that there are no significant changes in the proliferative

index of human prostate tumor xenografts from PC-3 and DU-145
cells derived from untreated and DZ-50–treated tumor-bearing
hosts. In contrast, treatment with DZ-50 led to a significant
suppression of vascularity and angiogenesis, as detected by the
reduced CD31 immunoreactivity in both PC-3– and DU-145–
derived prostate tumor xenografts compared with the untreated
prostate tissue (control mice; Table 1; Supplementary Table S2).
The results from the immunohistochemical analysis of prostate
tumor apoptosis, vascularity, and cell proliferation indicate that
the DZ-50–mediated reduction in prostate tumor growth is, at
least in part, consequential to targeting and reduction of
angiogenesis.
The ability of DZ-50 to directly affect tumor cell metastasis was
evaluated with the in vivo spontaneous metastasis assay. Following
21 days of DZ-50 treatment, there was a significant reduction in the
number of metastatic foci to the lungs compared with the
untreated control mice (Fig. 6). These results indicate the ability
of DZ-50 to prevent and reduce prostate tumor growth, as well as
inhibit invasion and metastatic potential in vivo.

Discussion
This study shows that our lead drug, DZ-50, a novel quinazolinebased compound, effectively targets human prostate tumor epithelial cells as well as vascular endothelial cells without inducing
classic apoptosis. This unique feature of the antitumor action of
the new drug, inducing a pattern of cell death that is independent
of caspase-activation characteristic of apoptotic signaling, is
mechanistically intriguing. The invasion process requires a range
of cell-to-cell interactions, primarily through the association of
adhesion complexes between tumor cells and the adjacent
endothelial cells. The present findings indicate that DZ-50 triggers
the anoikis phenomenon, as it interferes with prostate tumor cell
migration and attachment to ECM components fibronectin and
type I collagen (most abundant protein in bone). Examination of
the ability of tumor cells to extravasate by an in vitro model of
transendothelial migration revealed that prostate tumor cells, on
treatment with DZ-50, lost their ability to attach to the monolayer
of endothelial cells; our results indicate that attachment of tumor
epithelial cells to an endothelial monolayer was significantly

inhibited after 6 h of exposure to DZ-50 and was completely
abrogated after 9 h of treatment at noncytotoxic doses. These
in vitro data indicate that the lead compound can effectively
minimize the possibility of transendothelial invasion and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells.
Collagen I binds the integrin pairs a1h1, a2h1, and a3h1 (19), and
although we were unable to detect a1 expression in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cells, there was strong expression of integrins a2h1
and a3h1. Following exposure to DZ-50, the PC-3 prostate cancer
cells (originally isolated from a prostate tumor bone metastasis)
exhibited complete loss of integrin h1 surface expression, whereas
DU-145 prostate cancer cells had a minimal loss. Interestingly,
human prostate cancer cells, characterized by a specific ability
for bone metastasis, migrate toward collagen type I in an a2h1dependent manner, leading to increased in vivo growth within the
bone (20). Thus, one could argue that down-regulation of integrin
h1 could provide the molecular basis for the response of prostate
cancer cells to DZ-50. The regulation of h1 integrin expression
has been shown to be altered by TGF-h1 signaling (21), at the

200 mg/kg) was administered p.o. (via oral gavage) to tumor-bearing hosts for 14 d (subsequent to palpable tumor formation). Tumor volume was measured daily as
described in Materials and Methods; DZ-50 treatment significantly suppressed prostate tumor volume compared with the vehicle control (P < 0.001). C, primary

nude mice were s.c. inoculated (n = 6 per group) with PC-3 cells with concurrent exposure (p.o.) to DZ-50 (200 mg/kg) for 2 wk. D, prostate cancer xenografts were
excised from DZ-50–treated and vehicle control tumor-bearing mice, paraffin embedded, and then tissue sections (6 Amol/L) were subjected to immunohistochemical
analysis for apoptosis, cell proliferation, and tumor vascularity (A and B ). The three images represent TUNEL staining for apoptosis, CD31 immunoreactivity for
vascularity, and Ki67 expression for cell proliferation (magnification, 400).

NOTE: Quantitative analysis of immunostaining of tumor sections (Fig. 5) revealed significant decrease in the number of CD31-positive cells was
detected in both PC-3–, and DU-145– derived prostate tumors following treatment with DZ-50. Neither the apoptotic nor the proliferative index of the

transcriptional level by its attachment to the ECM, at posttranscriptional or translational level (22, 23), and during differentiation
(24) and cancer progression (25). Moreover, integrin a2h1 mediates
PC-3 cell adhesion to collagen and fibronectin, both major
components of bone microenvironment (19), with some therapeutic promise. Thus, ionizing radiation leads to a significant
reduction in h1 integrin levels and a decrease in cell adhesion to
fibronectin (26).
The present findings indicate that in vivo administration of
the novel lead drug DZ-50 (at well-tolerated doses) not only
significantly inhibits the growth of established human xenograft
prostate tumors but also prevents the initiation of prostate
cancer development in this model. Moreover, exposure to DZ-50

resulted in a considerable suppression of the metastatic capacity
of human prostate cancer cells, potentially by targeting their
invasion and migration potential. Initial mechanistic dissection
pointed to integrins as primary candidates of drug targeting.
Integrin h1–knockout mice fail to develop a vasculature (27);
thus, a direct functional link between reduced tumor growth and
a lack of integrin h1 is an attractive possibility. Furthermore,
VEGF directly activates integrins a5h1 and a2h1, which are both
implicated in angiogenesis (28). One could easily argue that loss
of integrin h1 expression by DZ-50 (as detected in the present
study) could interfere with VEGF signaling and thus lead to
reduced tumor vascularity without affecting tumor cell death.
VEGF has been specifically targeted by strategies such as

monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab) and inhibitors of endothelial cell receptor–associated tyrosine kinase activity (9). Other
approaches including targeting basement membrane degradation,
endothelial cell migration, and endothelial cell proliferation
have also been clinically evaluated, but success has been variable
(29, 30).
Increases in patient survival in response to any antiangiogenic
therapy have yet to be reported and current antiangiogenic therapy
has been clinically ineffective. Phase III clinical trial data are lacking
for any novel antiangiogenic compound, thus the immediate need
for new targeted therapies for metastatic prostate cancer. Ongoing
studies focus on dissecting the ability of the lead DZ compounds to
target the interactions between integrin h1 and its intracellular
signaling partners. Decreased surface expression of integrin h1
might result from down-regulation at the transcriptional or translational level. Alternatively, integrin h1 deregulation in response to
DZ-50 might be an indirect effect from alterations in the focal
adhesion complex (talin, focal adhesion kinase) and other key
components of the actin microfilaments that determine cell motility
and migration. From a therapeutic standpoint, either mechanism
could prove beneficial because by reducing the migratory capacity
of tumor epithelial cells and/or inducing anoikis of endothelial
cells, we could effectively prevent their ability to metastasize.
Because analytic measurement of DZ-50 levels in plasma and/or
tissues has yet to be developed, we cannot conclude that the drug
concentrations shown to be effective in vitro (10 Amol/L) could be
achieved in vivo. While recognizing this as a caveat that might
affect the translational value of the present findings, one has to also
consider the significant tumor growth suppression detected in

collectively suggesting that well-tolerated, effective concentrations
of DZ-50 can be achieved in vivo after p.o. administration. Ongoing
studies focus on the evaluation of the drug levels in biological
samples as well as subsequent biodistribution and pharmacokinetic analyses.
The observed effect of DZ-50 in preventing prostate tumor
development in the xenograft model implies a prophylactic value
for these compounds. Indirect support for such a concept stems
from the recent epidemiologic cohort study indicating that
exposure to doxazosin significantly decreases the incidence of
prostate cancer among men (31), thus suggesting a chemopreventive role for the quinazoline-based compounds.
Finally, a combination of DZ-50 (targeting vascularity) with an
apoptosis-inducing regimen for the treatment of metastatic
prostate cancer emerges as an attractive therapeutic possibility
