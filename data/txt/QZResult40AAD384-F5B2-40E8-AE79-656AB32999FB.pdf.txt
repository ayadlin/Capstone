Oncogene-Induced Sensitization to Chemotherapy-Induced
Death Requires Induction as well as Deregulation of E2F1
G. Vignir Helgason, Jim O'Prey, and Kevin M. Ryan

Abstract
The analysis of DNA tumor viruses has provided landmark insights into the molecular pathogenesis of
cancer. A paradigm for this field has been the study of the adenoviral E1a protein, which has led to the identification of proteins such as p300, p400, and members of the retinoblastoma family. Through binding Rb
family members, E1a causes deregulation of E2F proteins—an event common to most human cancers and
a central pathway in which oncogenes, including E1a, sensitize cells to chemotherapy-induced programmed
cell death. We report here, however, that E1a not only causes deregulation of E2F, but importantly that it also
causes the posttranscriptional upregulation of E2F1 protein levels. This effect is distinct from the deregulation
of E2F1, however, as mutants of E2F1 impaired in pRb binding are induced by E1a and E2F1 induction can also
be observed in Rb-null cells. Analysis of E1a mutants selectively deficient in cellular protein binding revealed
that induction of E2F1 is instead intrinsically linked to p400. Mutants unable to bind p400, despite being able
to deregulate E2F1, do not increase E2F1 protein levels and they do not sensitize cells to apoptotic death.
These mutants can, however, be complemented by either the knockdown of p400, resulting in the restoration
of the ability to induce E2F1, or by the overexpression of E2F1, with both events reenabling sensitization to
chemotherapy-induced death. Due to the frequent deregulation of E2F1 in human cancer, these studies reveal
potentially important insights into E2F1-mediated chemotherapeutic responses that may aid the development
of novel targeted therapies for malignant disease. Cancer Res; 70(10); 4074–80. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
At the cornerstone of our understanding of tumor development has been the mechanistic analysis of DNA tumor
viruses, which has led to seminal discoveries such as the identification of p53 and members of the retinoblastoma family
(1). Perhaps the most extensively studied among the oncoproteins from these viruses is the adenoviral E1a protein, which
in combination with other oncogenes has potent transforming potential (2). Central to this activity was the discovery that
E1a can inactivate the cellular Retinoblastoma protein, pRb
(3). Inactivation of pRb also occurs in many human tumors
in the absence of viral intervention and results in the deregulation of the cellular E2F family, which promotes cell cycle
progression (4, 5). Human cells have many checkpoints against
malignant transformation and oncogenes often also sensitize
cells to death to counter the potential replication of mutated
cells. The deregulation of E2F1 is no exception which, although

stimulating cell cycle progression, also primes for cell death induction by many agents including chemotherapeutic drugs (5).
In addition to binding members of the Rb family, studies of
E1a have also led to the identification of many other important cellular factors including p300/CBP, CtBP, and p400 (6).
p400 is the most recently described of these factors and has
been reported to be critical for the transforming potential of
E1a as well as for the ability of E1a to sensitize cells to death
(7). We report here another layer of complexity in the way
E1a sensitizes cells to death that has implications for the
way in which cellular E2F1 can be modulated to enhance
chemotherapy-induced tumor cell death.

E2F1 protein levels (Fig. 1A; ref. 5). This induction, as shown
here with the DNA-damaging agent, Adriamycin, is often a
posttranscriptional event with no change in E2F1 mRNA levels
(Fig. 1B). Significantly, we also observed that infection of primary, Tert-immortalized, human RPE cells with type 5 adenovirus 12S E1a markedly induces E2F1 protein levels (Fig. 1C),
without a concomitant increase in E2F1 mRNA (Fig. 1D).
E1a is known to regulate the activity of E2F1 by binding
members of the retinoblastoma family and in particular by
binding to the retinoblastoma protein itself, pRb (17–19). Because E1a-induced upregulation of E2F1 has not previously
been reported, we sought to determine if this new effect on
E2F1 was also mediated through a similar mechanism involving pRb. Wild-type E2F1, as well as a mutant lacking the
COOH-terminus of E2F1, which is deficient in Rb family
binding, (Δ374), were therefore infected into E2F1−/− MEFs,
which contain a transgene expressing E1aER (E1a fused
to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor;
refs. 20, 21). Treatment of these E1aER-expressing cells with
the weak estrogen, tamoxifen, causes the activation of E1a in
this system. In the E2F1−/− cells expressing the WT E2F1

transgene, E2F1 upregulation was again observed following
E1a activation, confirming the result observed in RPE cells
(Fig. 2A). E2F1-Δ374 levels were also increased following
E1a activation, indicating that the mechanism of E2F1 upregulation is distinct from E2F1 deregulation, as it does not
simply occur by E1a binding to Rb family proteins and sequestering them away from E2F1 (Fig. 2A; ref. 22).
Although pRb binding was not involved in the upregulation
of E2F1-Δ374 by E1a, it remained possible that the upregulation of WT E2F1 may involve an interaction between E1a and
pRB. To test this possibility, E1aER was infected into WT and
Rb−/− MEFs. In both cases, and in agreement with the result
obtained with the E2F1-Δ374 mutant, treatment with tamoxifen caused a considerable increase in endogenous E2F1 protein levels (Fig. 2B). Taken together, therefore, these results
show that E1a can upregulate E2F1 protein levels and that this
effect is independent of the binding of E1a to pRB (17–19).
Upregulation of E2F1 and sensitization to chemotherapyinduced death requires the region of E1a, which binds p400/
TRRAP. To investigate further the mechanism by which E1a
can increase E2F1 protein levels, we used a panel of previously

Figure 3. E1a mutants lacking p400 binding cannot induce E2F1 and are impaired in sensitization to chemotherapy-induced death. A, E1A mutants
that selectively lack the ability to bind cellular proteins were retrovirally transduced into RPE cells. The mutants lack amino acids, as defined. The mutant
R2G comprises full-length E1a with the second arginine mutated to glycine. The mutant tr143 consists of the first 143 amino acids of E1a. B, protein
lysates were prepared from cells and analyzed by Western blotting for E1a, E2F1, and actin. C, cells containing the E1a mutants, cells containing the empty
retroviral vector (pLPC), and uninfected RPE cells were treated with 0.5 μg/mL Adriamycin for 48 h. Cell populations were then analyzed for cell death
by flow cytometry.

E2F1 Induction in E1a-Induced Sensitization to Death

described E1a mutants that lack regions required for binding
different cellular proteins including p300/CBP, p400/TRRAP,
and CtBP (7, 11, 22). These mutants are therefore
either selectively or collectively impaired in the engagement
of these factors (Fig. 3A; ref. 11). RPE cells were infected with
these mutants and their expression was assessed by Western
blotting (Fig. 3B). The majority of the mutants, even the tr143
mutant, which is expressed at relatively low levels, were able
to induce E2F1 protein levels (Fig. 3B). The mutants Δ2-24,
Δ2-36, and Δ26-35, however, were either unable or severely
impaired in their ability to induce E2F1 (Fig. 3B). All of these
E1a mutants retain an intact CR2 region, and in line with
this, two of the mutants have previously been shown to bind
pRb (22). As a result of pRB binding, this will cause the deregulation of E2F1, indicating once again that E2F1 induction
is not simply a result of E2F1 transcriptional deregulation (7).
Each of these mutants, however, share one common feature
in that they are all unable to bind the cellular proteins p400/
TRRAP (Fig. 3A). In contrast, all of the E1a mutants that are
able to induce E2F1 retain the ability to bind p400/TRRAP
(Fig. 3A; refs. 7, 11, 22).
Because the ability of E1a to induce E2F1 protein levels
required regions involved in p400/TRAPP binding, we next
tested if this correlated with the ability of E1a to sensitize
to cell death. The panel of E1a mutants were therefore infected into RPE cells and sensitivity to cell death was assessed following treatment with Adriamycin by observing
the visual detachment of cells and the appearance of cells
with sub-G1 DNA content by flow cytometry. This revealed,
in an identical manner to what was observed for E2F1 induction, that those mutants lacking p400/TRRAP binding were
refractory to death induction by Adriamycin (Fig. 3C).
Knockdown of p400 enables E2F1 induction and sensitizes
cells to chemotherapy-induced programmed cell death
in cells expressing an E1a mutant lacking p400/TRRAP
binding. Because only E1a mutants able to bind p400 were
able to affect E2F1 protein levels, we next questioned if
there could be a direct interaction between E2F1 and p400
in cells. In agreement with previous studies that have shown
an interaction between E2F1 and the Tip60 acetyltransferase
complex, which has been shown to contain p400 (23, 24), immunoprecipitation of p400 with an antibody that does not
cross-react with E2F1 (data not shown) could effectively
bring down E2F1 in situations where both E2F1 and p400
were coexpressed in cells (Fig. 4). In light of this result and
the results with E1a deletion mutants, we next tested whether the inability of the E1a mutant Δ26-35 to induce E2F1 protein levels could be connected to its inability to modulate
p400. RPE cells and RPE cells expressing E1a-Δ26-35 were
therefore transfected with siRNAs targeting p400 or a scrambled
siRNA as control. Both p400-targeted siRNAs caused a 70% to
80% reduction in p400 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Analysis of E2F1 by Western blotting revealed that knockdown
of p400 either in the absence or presence of E1a-Δ26-35 caused
a marked increase in E2F1 protein levels (Fig. 5A).
We also questioned if the inability of E1a-Δ26-35 to sensitize cells to chemotherapy-induced death could be rescued
by knockdown of p400. RPE cells and RPE cells expressing

Figure 4. E2F1 interacts with p400. Cells were transiently transfected
with the indicated plasmids. Cell lysates were generated and
immunoprecipitated (IP) with an antibody against p400. Lysates were
then assayed by Western analyses (WB) for the presence of p400,
E1a, and E2F1. Input lysates were also assayed by Western blotting to
confirm equal expression in different samples of E2F1, E1a, and actin.

E1a-Δ26-35 were therefore subjected to p400 knockdown
and subsequently treated with Adriamycin. In RPE cells expressing E1a-Δ26-35, despite increased cell death being observed in all cases due to the siRNA transfection, this
revealed that knockdown of p400 caused a marked increase
in the ability of these cells to undergo chemotherapy-induced
programmed cell death as assessed by visible detachment
of the cells from the dish and the appearance of cells with
sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 5B). This result was surprising as
previous studies had shown that p400 knockdown could not
rescue the ability of E1a-Δ26-35 to sensitize cells to death (7).
Although we are not clear about the reason for this discrepancy, this may simply be a reflection of the different cell
types used in each study or the extent, or mode of action,
of RNA interference used in the separate studies—acute
(siRNA) in our study versus chronic (short hairpin RNA) used
by Samuelson and colleagues (7).
In contrast to the effect we observed in RPE cells expressing E1a-Δ26-35, no increase in cell death was observed,
however, in RPE cells, which had not been transduced with
a virus expressing E1a-Δ26-35 (Fig. 5B), indicating that
simple upregulation of E2F1 as observed in Fig. 5A is
insufficient to sensitize cells to death and that other
activities of E1a—presumably through the binding of Rb
family members, which leads to E2F1 transcriptional
deregulation—are also required for effective sensitization
to death (22).
Ectopic expression of E2F1 complements the lack of
p400 binding by E1a mutants to sensitize cells to
chemotherapy-induced programmed cell death. We next
questioned whether the increased levels of E2F1 following
p400 knockdown were potentially responsible for the increased
sensitivity of cells to Adriamycin. Mutant E1a–expressing

cells or control cells (which express an “empty” pLPC
retrovirus) were therefore infected with either an adenovirus
expressing E2F1 or an adenovirus containing no transgene
as control followed by treatment with Adriamycin for 48 hours
(Fig. 5C). In the presence of mutant E1a, the ectopic expression
of E2F1 caused a marked increase in the sensitivity of these
cells to undergo Adriamycin-induced death as assessed by visible detachment of the cells from the dish and the appearance
of cells with sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 5D). Expression of E2F1
alone, however, in the absence of Adriamycin, did not cause
cell death either in mutant E1a–expressing or control cells.
Moreover, only a minimal increase in cell death was observed
following Adriamycin treatment of control cells (no E1a) that
had been infected with E2F1 (Fig. 5D). These results, therefore,
underscore the fact that it is both the increased expression, as
well as the deregulation (22), of E2F1 by E1a that are required
to sensitize cells to chemotherapy-induced programmed cell
death.

Discussion
Taken together, these studies add a new and important
layer of complexity that redefines our comprehension of
the way the extensively studied E1a protein modulates the
cellular Rb:E2F axis to sensitize cells to death. Because the
actions of the E1a protein have been extensively studied, it
is therefore vitally important to consider how these findings
fit in with those previously provided by others.

In an almost parallel study, Tansey and coworkers (25, 26)
have shown that E1a can cause the stabilization of c-Myc
protein levels and that this stabilization is required for the
ability of E1a to fully sensitize cells to chemotherapy-induced
death (Fig. 6). The stabilization of c-Myc also involved the
ability of E1a to bind p400, but this seems mechanistically
distinct from the way in which E2F1 is stabilized. In the case
of c-Myc, E1a was reported to facilitate the formation of a
complex between c-Myc and p400, and this resulted in
c-Myc protein stabilization (25). In the study we present here,
however, it would be predicted by the fact that the knockdown of p400 causes an increase in E2F1 protein levels
(Fig. 5) and that a complex between p400 and E2F1 is not
required for E2F1 stabilization to occur. Because we show
that E2F1 can bind p400 (Fig. 4), it could be predicted instead
that E1a may sequester p400 away from E2F1-causing stabilization, although the way in which this ultimately leads to
E2F1 stabilization is yet to be determined and we cannot
completely discount the possibility that other proteins that
bind in the E1a Δ25-36 region may also be involved
(Fig. 6). It is tempting to speculate, however, that if E1a does
take a component of the cellular p400 pool away from E2F1,
it is then used by E1a to form c-Myc:p400 complexes resulting in sensitization to death by accumulation of both c-Myc
and E2F1. In an attempt to address if this were the case, we
first assessed if c-Myc levels were also increased in our cell
systems following activation of E1aER in MEFs and RPE cells.
In both cell types, although clear increases of E2F1 protein

Figure 5. The activity of E1a mutants deficient in p400 binding can be complemented by p400 knockdown or ectopic expression of E2F1. A, RPE cells
and RPE cells expressing the E1a mutant Δ26-35 were transfected with two different siRNAs targeting p400 or a scrambled siRNA (Scr) as control.
Protein lysates were prepared from cells and analyzed by Western blotting for E2F1 and actin. B, RPE cells and RPE cells expressing Δ26-35 and which
had been subjected to either p400 or control siRNA transfection were treated with 0.1 μg/mL Adriamycin (Adr) for 48 h and analyzed for cell death by
flow cytometry. C and D, RPE cells expressing Δ2-36 or empty viral vector as control (cont.) were infected with an adenovirus lacking E1 sequences,
which expresses WT E2F1 or empty adenoviral vector as control (also lacking E1 sequences). Where indicated, cells were treated with 0.5 μg/mL
Adriamycin for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting for E2F1, E1a, and actin (C). Cell populations were also analyzed for
cell death by flow cytometry (D).

E2F1 Induction in E1a-Induced Sensitization to Death

Figure 6. A model summarizing the reported effects of E1a on c-Myc,
E2F1, and p400. Previous studies have shown, and we report here, that
E2F1 can bind pRb and p400. Numerous previous studies have also
shown that E1a can bind pRb and p400. Binding of pRb by p400 results
in the transcriptional deregulation of E2F1. From the studies we report
here, we propose that E1a also sequesters p400 away from E2F1 and
causes stabilization of E2F1 protein levels. Both upregulation and
transcriptional deregulation of E2F1 are required for full sensitization
to chemotherapy-induced death. Previous studies have also reported
that E1a promotes an interaction between p400 and c-Myc and this
causes the stabilization of c-Myc protein levels. Stabilization of c-Myc
is also required for complete sensitization to death. Various studies
have reported cross-talk between E2F1 and c-Myc. Questions still remain
at this point and at other points indicated by “?” in the schematic.
These questions are discussed further in the main body of the article.

levels could be detected, no increase in c-Myc was observed
in either system (Supplementary Fig. S2). This clearly indicated therefore that the stabilization of c-Myc, and potentially also E2F1, by E1a are cell type and maybe context
dependent.

Despite the fact that c-Myc was not upregulated in our cell
systems, the protein was clearly expressed and so it is still
important to consider the numerous reports that have shown
interplay between c-Myc and E2F1. On the one hand, E2F1
has been shown to increase the expression of c-Myc, and
in a converse manner, c-Myc has been shown to modulate
microRNA control of E2F1 expression and facilitate transactivation by E2F1 (27–30). In addition, E2F1 and c-Myc have
been shown to cooperate in cell death induction through p53
(31). Ultimately in Fig. 6, we draw together the findings of our
study with those of others on the effects of E1a on E2F1 and
c-Myc. We also attempt to rationalize how E2F1 and c-Myc
come together in the absence of E1a to ultimately regulate
sensitivity to death. Where questions remain is also highlighted and these undoubtedly represent areas worthy of further investigation (Fig. 6).
Although many questions still remain because the deregulation of E2F1 is a facet of multiple human cancers and because many chemotherapeutic drugs independently cause
the upregulation of E2F1 protein levels, the potential implications of these findings may well be more widespread than
studies focused on E1a. Subsequent studies in this regard,
particularly with respect to the use of differing concentrations of Adriamycin and additional chemotherapeutic drugs,
will therefore hopefully lead to a fuller understanding of
the generality and potential consequences of this important
observation.
