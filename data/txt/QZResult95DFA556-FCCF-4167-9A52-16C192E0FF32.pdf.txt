ABSTRACT
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPIs) kill cancer cells by trapping
PARP1 and PARP2. Talazoparib, the most potent PARPI inhibitor (PARPI), exhibits
remarkable selectivity among the NCI-60 cancer cell lines beyond BRCA inactivation.
Our genomic analyses reveal high correlation between response to talazoparib and
Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) expression. Causality was established in four isogenic SLFN11positive and -negative cell lines and extended to olaparib. Response to the talazoparibtemozolomide combination was also driven by SLFN11 and validated in 36 small cell
lung cancer cell lines, and in xenograft models. Resistance in SLFN11-deficient cells
was caused neither by impaired drug penetration nor by activation of homologous
recombination. Rather, SLFN11 induced irreversible and lethal replication inhibition,
which was independent of ATR-mediated S-phase checkpoint. The resistance to
PARPIs by SLFN11 inactivation was overcome by ATR inhibition, mechanistically
because SLFN11-deficient cells solely rely on ATR activation for their survival under
PARPI treatment. Our study reveals that SLFN11 inactivation, which is common
(~45%) in cancer cells, is a novel and dominant resistance determinant to PARPIs.

INTRODUCTION

had widely different cytotoxicity [2, 7, 8], and that this
differential cytotoxicity was driven by the potency of the
drugs to stabilize PARP-DNA complexes at SSBs (PARPtrapping) [7, 8]. Hence, the clinical PARPIs differ by
their PARP trapping potency (talazoparib >> niraparib ≈
olaparib ≈ rucaparib >> veliparib), which corresponds to
their cytotoxic potency [9].
PARP-DNA complexes can be obstacles for
replication and induce replicative DNA damage [8]. In
response to replicative damage, ATR (ataxia telangiectasia
and Rad3-related protein kinase) plays a major role for
coordinating cell cycle progression and DNA repair
[10, 11]. ATR activates the S-phase checkpoint by
phosphorylating the cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1,
CHK1 at serine 345, which slows down replication forks
(elongation checkpoint), stabilizes stalled replication
forks and prevents replication origin firing (origin firing
checkpoint) [12-14]. The S-phase checkpoint promotes
DNA repair and prevents premature mitosis, thereby

Several PARP inhibitors (PARPIs) are in advanced
clinical trials, and olaparib has recently been approved
for advanced ovarian cancer carrying BRCA mutations.
All clinical PARPIs are competitive NAD+ inhibitors.
They all block poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation)
[1, 2], which is a critical step of base excision repair
(BER), the major pathway for repairing DNA singlestrand breaks (SSBs) [3, 4]. Since SSBs are among the
most frequent endogenous DNA lesions repaired by
PARP1 and PARP2, and the discovery of the synthetic
lethality of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-deficient cells,
the mechanism by which PARPIs exert their cytotoxicity
has been dominantly interpreted as an accumulation of
SSBs resulting in lethal DNA double-strand breaks upon
replication stalling in cancer cells defective in homologous
recombination (HR) [5, 6]. Further studies showed that
PARPIs with equivalent potency as PARylation inhibitors

maintaining genomic stability [10, 11]. Loss of the
S-phase checkpoint by inhibitors of ATR or CHK1 causes
unscheduled firing of replication origins in S-phase and
the induction of DNA double-strand breaks [13, 15-17].
The US National Cancer Institute cancer cell lines
(NCI-60), which are derived from 9 tissues of origin:
breast, colon, skin, blood, central nervous system,
lung, prostate, ovary and kidney, is the most annotated
set of cancer cell lines with whole genome expression
and mutation profiles, and drug responses for more
than 200,000 compounds [18-20], as well as a variety
of molecular and cellular processes [20, 21]. Taking
advantage of the NCI-60, we previously discovered
Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) expression as an unanticipated
genomic determinant of response to topoisomerase (Top)
1 inhibitors, Top2 inhibitors, alkylating agents, and DNA
synthesis inhibitors [22-24]. Independently, SLFN11 was
identified as a predictive genomic biomarker for Top1
inhibitors in the larger database of the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) [25]. Importantly, lack of SLFN11
mRNA expression is observed in ~45% of the cancer
cells in the NCI-60 and CCLE panel. The importance of
SLFN11 for drug sensitivity has recently been extended
to Ewing’s sarcomas [26], and to patient responses in
ovarian, non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers [23,
24, 27]. A recent study revealed that SLFN11 inhibits
checkpoint maintenance and homologous recombination
by removing RPA from single stranded DNA [28].
Although talazoparib is the most potent PARPI
for PARP-trapping [7, 9], approximately half of the
NCI-60 cell lines are highly resistant to the drug, with
cell viability above 50% even when the cells are treated
with 100 µM talazoparib (~1,000-fold more than
clinical relevant blood concentrations) [7]. On the other
hand, about half of the cell lines are highly sensitive to
talazoparib at low micromolar or nanomolar ranges of IC50
(inhibitory concentration 50%). Although BRCA status
may affect the differential sensitivity in each cell line,
BRCA deficiency by homozygous deleterious mutation
or lack of expression is only found in one of the NCI60 cell lines [22]. Moreover, this BRCA2-deficient cell
line (HCC2998) is resistant to talazoparib [7] (Figure
1A). Therefore, uncovered determinants of response to
talazoparib, olaparib and other PARPIs beyond BRCA
are awaiting discovery. In this study, we demonstrate
the importance of SLFN11 expression as a determinant
of response to talazoparib in cancer cell lines and in
xenograft models, and extend these findings to olaparib
and to the combination of talazoparib with temozolomide.
We also provide a rationale to overcome resistance to
PARP inhibitors in SLFN11-negative cells by combining
PARP and ATR inhibitors.

SLFN11 expression correlates with sensitivity to
PARP inhibitors
To identify novel genomic determinants of response
to talazoparib, we took advantage of the fact that
talazoparib (BMN 673) had been tested in the NCI-60 [7]
and of the extensive NCI-60 genomic databases available
through the Web application CellMiner (http://discover.
nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) [20, 22]. Schlafen 11 (SLFN11)
came up as one of the top ranking genes (Pearson’s r
= 0.62, p = 5.4x10-7) (Figure 1A). The two other PARP
inhibitors in the NCI-60 database, olaparib and veliparib,
showed positive but not statistically significant correlation
with SLFN11 expression (Figure 1A, right panels).
The correlation between SLFN11 expression and
PARPI response was independently tested in five NCI60 cells lines, two with high SLFN11 transcripts, prostate
DU145 and CNS SF295, and three with low transcripts,
breast MDA_MB231, colon HT29 and HCT116.
Additionally, we tested two Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines,
EW8 and A673 with high SLFN11 transcripts [25, 26].
SLFN11 protein levels were consistent with transcript
levels (Figure 1B). SLFN11-positive cells (red) were more
sensitive to both talazoparib and olaparib with lower IC50
(inhibitory concentration 50%) than SLFN11-negative cells
(blue) (Figure 1C). The differential sensitivity of SLFN11positive vs. -negative cells was even more pronounced for
talazoparib than olaparib. On the other hand, for veliparib,
none of the cells reached IC50 at drug concentrations up to
25 µM. These results revealed that SLFN11 expression is
correlated with the sensitivity to PARP-trapping inhibitors
(olaparib and talazoparib) but not to the relatively pure
catalytic PARP inhibitor (veliparib) [7, 9].

Genetic inactivation of SLFN11 renders cancer
cells resistant to PARPIs
To determine the causal involvement of SLFN11
for PARPI sensitivity, we generated SLFN11-deleted
(SLFN11-del) isogenic cell lines from four cell lines with
high SLFN11 (prostate DU145, leukemia CCRF-CEM
and MOLT4, and Ewing’s sarcoma EW8) [23, 26] using
CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure S1). To avoid off-target effects
by the similarity of guide RNA sequences to off-target
genome regions, we designed two guide RNA sequences,
(A) and (B), and generated independent clones using
each guide RNA in every cell line. In the absence of drug
treatment, there was no apparent difference in cell cycle
or growth rate between the parental and SLFN11-del cells
across the four cell lines (Figure S1).
All four SLFN11-del cell lines showed resistance to
both talazoparib and olaparib compared to their parental

have very low SLFN11 transcript (Figure 1A) conferred
hypersensitivity to talazoparib and olaparib (Figure
S2C). Hence, we conclude that SLFN11 is a dominant
determinant of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.
Temozolomide, which is FDA-approved for
glioblastomas, is highly synergistic with PARPIs
even at concentrations where neither talazoparib nor
temozolomide alone affect cell viability [7, 29]. This is

counterpart in 72 hours cell viability assays (Figure 2A).
Consistent results were obtained by clonogenic assays
(Figure S2A) and acute depletion of SLFN11 with siRNA
transfection (Figure S2B). Depletion of SLFN11 by
siRNA conferred as much resistance as depleting PARP1
itself, which mediates the cytotoxicity of talazoparib and
olaparib [7, 8] (Figure S2B). Conversely, exogenous
expression of SLFN11 in leukemia K562 cells that

and EW8 parental and SLFN11-del cells (Figure 3D).
Consistent with the known role of HR for PARPI response,
BRCA2 depletion augmented the sensitivity to talazoparib
in parental SLFN11-expressing DU145 and EW8 cells.
Furthermore, BRCA2 depletion also reduced the viability
of the SLFN11-del cells, and this sensitization was as
extensive as in the case of the parental cells. These results
demonstrate that HR is functional regardless of SLFN11,
and that, SLFN11 is involved in a different pathway from
the currently recognized HR and drug efflux pathways that
determine response to PARPI.

because temozolomide alkylates guanine N7 resulting in
abasic sites and single-strand breaks that recruit PARP1
and PARP2 and lead to PARP trapping [29]. Accordingly,
combinations of PARP inhibitors and temozolomide are
currently in clinical trials for various cancers beyond
BRCA status [30]. We compared the talazoparibtemozolomide combination in the four isogenic parental
and SLFN11-del cells (Figure 2B). The MGMT (O6methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) status is known
to determine temozolomide sensitivity [31, 32]. All four
cell lines used for knocking out SLFN11 are MGMTproficient (data not shown), and therefore highly resistant
to temozolomide because O6-methylguanine adducts
are readily repaired by MGMT, and the DNA nicks
generated by N7-methylguanine [32] are readily repaired
in PARP1/2 proficient cells (Figure 2B). The addition of
talazoparib markedly and synergistically sensitized the
parental cells to temozolomide. However, in SLFN11del cells, the combination had marginal effect (Figure
2B). These results demonstrate that SLFN11 expression
determines the sensitivity to PARP inhibitor-temozolomide
combination in MGMT-proficient cells.

SLFN11 induces prolonged S-phase arrest under
talazoparib treatment, and exerts apoptosis
Because talazoparib induces replicative DNA
damage (Figure 3B), we examined the effects of SLFN11
on cell cycle progression after talazoparib treatment. In
response to talazoparib, DU145 parental cells showed
marked S-phase arrest with suppression of BrdU
incorporation in mid- and late-S phase at 24 hours, and
throughout S-phase at 48 hours (Figure 4A, 1, 3, 7). By
contrast, the SLFN11-del cells showed an attenuated
replication inhibition at 24 hours, and reached G2-phase
(4N) at 48 hours (Figure 4A, 2, 5, 9). Similar results were
obtained with the other three isogenic cell lines. They
also showed higher G2 peaks in SLFN11-del cells than
in the parental cells whereas the parental cells showed
mid-S phase arrest under talazoparib treatment at 24 hours
(Figure S3). Because prolonged replication fork stalling
leads to lethal replisome disassembly and fork breakage
[38], the prolonged S-phase arrest is likely to cause the
hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors in SLFN11-expressing
cells.
Apoptosis analyses revealed that the percentage
of apoptotic cells at 48 hours after talazoparib treatment
increased from 9% to 29% and from 5% to 58% in DU145
and CCRF-CEM parental cells, respectively. By contrast,
in the SLFN11-del DU145 and CCRF-CEM cells, the
percentage of apoptotic cells increased only marginally
from 5% to 9% and from 5% to 7%, respectively (Figure
S4). These results imply that SLFN11 enforces S-phase
arrest, and that prolonged S-phase arrest by SLFN11
induces apoptosis and causes hypersensitivity to PARP
inhibitors.

SLFN11 does not impact drug penetration or
homologous recombination (HR) activation
Two well-established mechanisms of resistance to
PARPIs include [33, 34]: 1/ reactivation of HR, which
enables cells to overcome replicative damage [35-37], and
2/ activation of multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps,
which limits cellular drug levels [33]. To examine whether
SLFN11 is involved in these mechanisms of resistance,
first we checked the kinetics of PARP trapping in response
to talazoparib [8] (Figure 3A). Similar accumulation of
PARP1 in chromatin-bound fractions was observed
regardless of the cellular SLFN11 status, indicating that
SLFN11 does not affect cellular penetration or efflux of
talazoparib.
Next we examined replicative damage induced
by PARP trapping and whether the effects of SLFN11
were related to HR. FACS analyses showed that cells
in S- and G2-phase increased γH2AX level after
talazoparib treatment regardless of SLFN11 expression
(Figure 3B), suggesting that replicative damage was
induced by talazoparib regardless of the SLFN11 status.
Intensity of γH2AX and RAD51 foci measured by
immunofluorescence microscopy were also comparably
increased in DU145 parental and SLFN11-del cells
treated with talazoparib for 3 hours (Figure 3C). Because
BRCA1/2 are necessary for the formation of RAD51
foci, the similar level of RAD51 foci formation in both
cell lines indicates that the BRCA1/2 are functional in
dependently of SLFN11.
To further examine the parallel activities SLFN11
and HR, we depleted BRCA2 by siRNA transfection and
compared the effects of BRCA2 inactivation in DU145

ATR inhibition overcomes the resistance of
SLFN11-negative cells to PARPIs
Because ATR plays a major role in coordinating
cell cycle progression and DNA repair in response to
replicative damage, we examined whether SLFN11
affects the ATR-dependent S-phase checkpoint or not. We
measured phospho-CHK1 (S345), a key effector of ATR
[10, 11], after talazoparib treatment. Comparable levels

phospho-CHK1 (S345) were observed in parental and
SLFN11-del cells across the four cell line pairs (Figure
S5), demonstrating that ATR activation by talazoparib is
independent of SLFN11.
To determine whether the SLFN11-dependent
S-phase arrest was linked to ATR, we combined the ATR
inhibitor (VE-821) with talazoparib. Addition of the
ATR inhibitor recovered replication almost completely
at 24 hours in SLFN11-del cells, but induced incomplete
replication with accumulation of sub-G1 population at 48
hours (Figure 4A, 6 and 10), indicating that ATR-mediated

S-phase checkpoint dominantly regulates cell cycle
progression in the SLFN11-del cells. On the other hand,
the effect of ATR inhibition was marginal in the parental
cells at 24 and 48 hours with the bulk of the S-phase peak
only slightly shifted to 4N (Figure 4A, 4 and 8). These
results show that SLFN11 inhibits DNA replication in
parallel to ATR-mediated S-phase checkpoint.
ATR inhibitors, which are in clinical development
[17], synergize with DNA damaging agents including
topoisomerase inhibitors, gemcitabine, cisplatin and
veliparib by abrogating the S-phase checkpoint, resulting

in DNA damage accumulation. Because ATR inhibition
had marginal impact on cell cycle in SLFN11-positive
cells, while it had substantial impact in SLFN11-negative

cells, we examined whether the ATR inhibitor had a
different impact on the viability of SLFN11-positive and
-negative cells. Viability assays with PARP inhibitors

combined with or without VE-821 showed that ATR
inhibition was synergistic both with talazoparib and
olaparib in both the parental and SLFN11-del cells (Figure
4B). However, the synergy was consistently greater (with
lower Combination Index (CI) values) for all four isogenic
cell lines tested in the SLFN11-del than in the parental
cells (Figure 4B and Table S1).
Consistent to the results of cell cycle and viability
assays, apoptotic cells increased from 9% to 34% in
SLFN11-del DU145 cells, while they were already high
(29%) with talazoparib alone, and increased only slightly
(from 29% to 38%) by ATR inhibition in SLFN11-positive
DU145 cells (Figure S4A). Similar results were obtained
using CCRF-CEM parent and SLFN11-del cells (Figure
S4B). These results demonstrate the potential value of
combining talazoparib or olaparib with ATR inhibitors,
especially as a way to overcome the resistance of SLFN11negative cells to PARP inhibitors.

by a factor of approximately 10-fold (Figure 5C).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that, in SCLC cell
lines, SLFN11 expression determines cellular sensitivity
to both talazoparib and the talazoparib-temozolomide
combination, suggesting the potential value of combining
temozolomide with talazoparib in SLFN11-positive SCLC.

The combination talazoparib-temozolomide
shows greater synergy in SCLC xenograft models
with SLFN11-positive than SLFN11-negative cells
Next we examined the talazoparib-temozolomide
combination in xenograft models using three SCLC cell
lines harboring different SLFN11 and MGMT status:
NCI-H209 (high SLFN11, high MGMT), NCI-H841 (low
SLFN11, high MGMT) and NCI-H1092 (high SLFN11,
low MGMT) (Table S3) (Figure 5D). A preceding paper
showed that MGMT-positive cancer cells strongly
respond to the combination of temozolomide and PARP
inhibitors (PARPi), whereas MGMT-deficient cells do
not because MGMT-negative cells are primarily killed by
unrepaired O6-methyl-guanine generated by low dose of
temozolomide [42].
As NCI-H209 cells (with high SLFN11 expression)
respond well to daily talazoparib treatment [43], in this
study, to examine the effect of talazoparib + temozolomide
combination, we administrated drugs during the initial 4
or 5 days, and then left mice without drugs for at least 14
days. We first tested a range of combination regimen using
low doses of temozolomide, and found that temozolomide
at 3 mg/kg/day for 4-5 days plus talazoparib at 0.25-0.33
mg/kg/day for 4-5 days can be tolerated in different host
mouse strains (Figure 5D). We then conducted comparative
assessment of each single agent versus the combination of
talazoparib plus temozolomide in these models. Although
temolozomide and talazoparib alone had marginal antitumor activity in NCI-H209 and NCI-H841 xenografts
models, the combination induced marked synergy in
NCI-H209 (high SLFN11) but not in NCI-H841 (low
SLFN11) (Figure 5D). On the other hand, temozolomide
alone was sufficient to reduce tumor growth in NCI-H1092
(low MGMT) xenograft (Figure 5D). These results show
that SLFN11 expression can determines cellular sensitivity
to talazoparib and temozolomide combination treatment
in tumor models, and that temozolomide single treatment
can be sufficient to reduce tumor growth if tumor cells are
MGMT-negative.

Screening with 36 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
cell lines reveals significant correlation between
SLFN11 expression and talazoparib sensitivity
Because of the promising activity of PARP inhibitors
for patients with SCLC [39, 40], we extended our findings
from the NCI-60 and our four isogenic SLFN11-del cell
lines to a panel of 36 SCLC cell lines (Table S2). All cells
have published genomic profiles (gene expression data)
from the Broad CCLE portal site, and examination of
SLFN11 expression revealed a non-normal distribution
with half of the cell lines (18 out 36) having minimal
or no SLFN11 expression (Log2 value below 4.5) and
15/36 having high SLFN11 expression (Log2 value above
6.5) (Figure 5A, Y-axis). Next, we measured the IC50 of
talazoparib (50% inhibition concentration) across the 36
SCLC cell lines (Table S3). SLFN11 transcript levels were
significantly correlated to the IC50 of talazoparib (p < 0.01,
Figure 5A). We also measured SLFN11 protein levels in
the SCLC lines by Western blotting and found that protein
levels matched SLFN11 transcripts (Figure 5B), which is
consistent with our NCI-60 data (Figure 1B) [23].
Because talazoparib in combination with
temozolomide results in remarkable synergy [29] and
activity in Ewing’s sarcoma models [41], we evaluated
the combination of temozolomide with talazoparib across
our SCLC cell line panel. We combined a non-toxic dose
of temozolomide (10 µM) with a range of talazoparib
concentrations, and determined the IC50 of talazoparib in
the presence and absence of temozolomide (Table S3). The

DISCUSSION
Our study establishes SLFN11 as a causal and
dominant determinant of cellular response to PARPIs
(talazoparib and olaparib), given as single agents and
in combination with temozolomide. It is the first report
demonstrating that SLFN11 affect cellular responses to

PARPIs independently of homologous recombination and
drug efflux by blocking DNA replication independently
of ATR. Moreover, we provide the rationale and proof of
concept for evaluating SLFN11 as a potentially important
biomarker of response for patients treated with PARPIs,
and for combining ATR and PARP inhibitors to overcome
the resistance of SLFN11-negative cells to PARPIs.

PARP-trapping by combining talazoparib or olaparib with
temozolomide [29] yielded SLFN11-dependent response
(Figures 2B). Although veliparib has weak PARP-trapping
potency [8, 9], it can exert cytotoxicity with temozolomide
by catalytic inhibition and by PARP-trapping at high dose
[45]. As our study went to press, similar conclusions
were reported by Lok et al. using SCLC cell lines and
SCLC patient derived xenograft models [46]. Together
both studies imply the potential of SLFN11 expression
as a dominant biomarker to predict response to PARPIs
as single agent acting by trapping PARP and damaging
DNA (talazoparib, olaparib, and probably niraparib and
rucaparib), as well as for combination regimens of broad
PARPis with temozolomide, which are in a large number
of ongoing clinical trials.
The synthetic lethality of PARPIs for BRCAdeficient cells is an elegant strategy, but the reality is
that not all BRCA deficient tumors respond to PARP
inhibitors [47, 48], and that PARPIs are also active beyond
homologous recombination deficiencies (HRD) [8, 49,
50]. Here we show that SLFN11 expression sensitizes to
PARPIs in parallel to BRCA-deficiency status (Figures
3 and 6). Therefore, tumors harboring HRD as well as
SLFN11 expression should be better responders than
tumors harboring either parameter. By contrast, tumors
without HRD and lacking SLFN11 expression should be
the worst responder for PARPIs (Figure 3D). Because
approximately 45% of cancer cell lines are SLFN11negative at the transcript level [23, 25], frequently
by promoter hypermethylation [24], SLFN11 can be

Clinical implications of SLFN11 for precision
medicine
A notable consideration is that the impact of SLFN11
is dependent on PARP trapping, which depends on the
PARPI (talazoparib >> niraparib ≈ olaparib ≈ rucaparib
>> veliparib) [8, 9]. Our data mining of the NCI-60
readily picked talazoparib, the most potent PARP trapping
inhibitor [7] as showing a highly significant correlation
between cancer cell killing and SLFN11 transcript levels
(Figure 1A). We also found that olaparib sensitivity but
not veliparib sensitivity was linked to SLFN11 expression
(Figure 1C). Moreover, highly significant correlation
between SLFN11 expression and olaparib response also
emerges from the recently released independent database
including 780 individual cancer cell lines treated with
olaparib (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ctrp/) [44]. Yet,
the impact of SLFN11 status on drug sensitivity was
higher for talazoparib than for olaparib throughout our
experiments. Consistent with the connection between
PARP-trapping and SLFN11, we found that increasing

to PARPIs in addition to BRCA mutations and HRD.
SLFN11 is detectable by immunohistochemistry from
tissue samples [27] [46]. Because SLFN11 determines
response to a wide range of DNA damaging drugs in
addition to PARPIs, further clinical studies and assays
are warranted to score SLFN11 expression in tumor

immunohistochemistry in breast cancer.

drug penetration nor by activation of homologous
recombination but by sustained cellular replicative
potential following DNA damage.
Our data clearly show that SLFN11 inhibits
replication and forces cell cycle arrest at mid S-phase
under talazoparib treatment, while SLFN11-negative
cells keep replicating and reach G2 (Figure 4A). Because
prolonged stalling of replication forks lead to lethal
replisome disassembly and fork breakage [38], the
prolonged S-phase arrest by SLFN11 is likely the cause
of SLFN11-dependent cell killing by PARP inhibitors.
Indeed, we found that apoptotic cell populations increased
after talazoparib treatment in SLFN11-positive cells
(Figure S5). Hence, we propose that prolonged S-phase
arrest by SLFN11 exerts apoptosis and hypersensitivity to
PARP inhibitors. Further studies are warranted to elucidate
the molecular details of how SLFN11 inhibits replication.

How does SLFN11 sensitize cancer cells to
PARPIs?
Two well-established mechanisms of resistance to
PARPIs include [33, 34]: 1/ reactivation of HR, which
enables cells to overcome replicative damage [35-37],
and 2/ activation of multidrug resistance (MDR) drug
efflux pumps, which limits cellular drug levels [33].
However, neither is related to SLFN11, as SLFN11
does not affect DNA damage level at early time point
(PARP-trapping, γH2AX and RAD51 level, Figure 3A
and 3C). We conclude that HR is functional regardless
of SLFN11 expression, which seems contradictory to
the recent publication of Mu et al. [28], who found that
SLFN11 inhibits checkpoint maintenance and homologous
recombination by removing RPA on single stranded DNA.
However, their conclusion was based on data collected
at 24 and 48 hours after camptothecin pulse treatment
(1 hour treatment, and then wash and release in drug
free medium) when cell cycle distributions are different
between SLFN11-positive and negative cells [23]. Our
study shows that SLFN11 induces prolonged S-phase
arrest at least until 48 hours after continuous talazoaparib
treatment while SLFN11-negative cells continue cell
cycle progression until reaching G2-phase (Figure 4A).
Because sister chromatids are not fully available under
the condition where replication is blocked at mid-Sphase by SLFN11, it is plausible that, at relatively late
time points, SLFN11 indirectly reduces HR marked by
RPA and RAD51 foci, and reduces ATR activation due
to diminished RPA loading. Consistent to the report by
Mu et al., we observed significantly higher RAD51 foci
formation in SLFN11-del cells than SLFN11-positive cells
at 24 hours after talazoparib treatment (data not shown).
We do not exclude the possibility that SLFN11 inhibits
HR via removal of RPA polymer as proposed by Mu et
al. [28]. However, we and Mu et al. observed comparable
RAD51 foci formation regardless of SLFN11 at early time
points after drug treatment (Figure 3C), indicating that
BRCAs are properly working for RAD51 deposition, and
that SLFN11 does not directly interfere with HR factors
like BRCAs. Our experiments using siRNA BRCA2
support our conclusion that SLFN11 acts in parallel with
HR (Figures 3 and 6). Hence, we conclude that resistance
in SLFN11-deficient cells is caused neither by impaired

Rationale for combining ATR and PARP
inhibitors to overcome resistance to PARPIs due
to SLFN11 inactivation
Although lack of SLFN11 expression is a major
cause of resistance to PARP inhibitors, we demonstrate
that the addition of an ATR inhibitor overcomes such
resistance (Figure 4). ATR is a guardian for S-phase cell
cycle under replicative damage [10, 11]. ATR inhibition
promotes unscheduled origin firing, and generates excess
single strand DNA leading to fork breakage and cell death
[16]. While ATR inhibition kills cell by accelerating
replication under replicative stress, in an opposite way,
SLFN11 kills cells by enforcing prolonged S-phase arrest
under PARP inhibitor treatment. Our experiments show
that ATR and PARP inhibitor combination synergizes
more in SLFN11-del cells than SLFN11-positive cells
(Figure 4B and Table S1). Figure 6 provides a schematic
representation of the role of SLFN11 in the context of
ATR activation. In response to replicative damage by
PARP trapping, SLFN11-positive cells use dual cell
cycle regulation: one is SLFN11-dependent prolonged
replication arrest leading to cell death, and the other is
ATR-dependent S-phase checkpoint that slows down cell
cycle and promotes cell survival. By contrast, SLFN11
deficient cells rely primarily on ATR activation for their
cell cycle regulation under the replicative damage. This
creates a synthetic lethality scenario [49, 50] for ATR
inhibitors in SLFN11-deficient cells as the combination of
PARP and ATR inhibitors abolishes cell cycle regulation
completely in SLFN11-deficient cell, but only partially
in the parental cells. Thus, the ATR-PARP inhibitors
combination has more impact in SLFN11-negative than in
SLFN11-positive cells. This conclusion could have broad
implications as 45-50% of cancer cell lines inactivate
SLFN11 [23-25].
In addition, our findings provide a link between

the marked sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma (EWS) cells
to olaparib [51] and the high SLFN11 expression in EWS
cells [25]. Combined with our recent finding that FLI1,
a transcription factor, upregulates of SLFN11 expression
[26], the link between EWS cells and the hypersensitivity
to PARP inhibitors can be derived from the high SLFN11
expression induced by EWS-FLI1 translocations in EWS
cells. An additional mechanism of hypersensitivity of
EWS cells to PARP inhibitors could be the importance
of PARP1 as a cofactor of FLI1 based on protein-protein
interaction between EWS-FLI1 and PARP1, and EWSFLI1:PARP1-positive feedback loop in transcriptional
activation [52]. Because, Ewing’s sarcoma initially
responds to DNA damaging agents, for which cell killing
depends on SLFN11 [22, 24, 44], it will be important
to determine the SLFN11 status of tumors in patients at
relapse.
In summary, our study reveals the relevance of
SLFN11 for PARPIs given alone and in combination with
temozolomide. Developing assays for assessing SLFN11
status as a predictive marker for tumor response to DNA
damaging agents and clarifying the molecular details
underlying SLFN11 biology are pressing tasks for the
future.

Cells were continuously exposed to the indicated
drug concentrations for 72 hours in triplicate. Five
thousand cells for CCRF-CEM, MOLT4 and K562, and
1,500 cells for SF295, DU145, EW8, A673, MDA_
MB231, H29 and HCT116 cells were seeded in 96-well
white plates (#6005680 Perkin Elmer Life Sciences)
in 100 µl of medium per well. Cellular viability was
determined using ATPlite 1-step kits (PerkinElmer). The
ATP level in untreated cells was defined as 100%. Viability
of treated cells was defined as: (ATP in treated cells)/(ATP

Generation of SLFN11-deleted cells
To delete the SLFN11 gene, we designed two
independent guide RNAs (A and B) targeting just
downstream of the start codon in the 4th exon using the
CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu) [55]. A human
codon-optimized SpCas9 and chimeric guide RNA
expression plasmid (pX330: pX330-U6-chimeric_BBCBh-hSpCas9) was purchased from Addgene. Each guide
RNA was inserted into the pX330 plasmid (pX330-A,
and pX330-B). The gene-targeting constructs harboring
homology arms and a puromycin-resistance gene were
prepared. Briefly, ~1 kb genomic sequences just upstream
and downstream of the Cas9 cleavage sites were amplified
by PCR methods from genomic DNA. The PCR products
of upstream site (left homology arm) and downstream
site (right homology arm) were subcloned into pCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen) at TA cloning site and ApaI/
XhoI restriction endonuclease site, respectively in the
desired direction. Puromycin resistance gene was finally
subcloned between the homology arms at the NotI
restriction endonuclease site. The targeting construct and
pX330-A or pX330-B were co-transfected into DU145 and
EW8 cells by lipofection and into CCRF-CEM and MOLT
cells by electroporation. After transfection, cells were
released into drug-free medium for 48 hours followed by
puromycin selection until single colonies were formed.
Single clones were expanded, and gene-deletion was
confirmed by Western blotting. PCR primers and guide
RNA sequences will be provided on request.

nanomolar of each siRNA was transfected to DU145
or EW8 cells with Lipofectamin RNAiMAX Reagent
(13778, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Culture medium was changed 6-8 hours after
the transfection. Two days after the transfection, total
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen),
followed by further purification using PureLink RNA Mini
Kit (Life Technology) with DNase treatment (Qiagen).
