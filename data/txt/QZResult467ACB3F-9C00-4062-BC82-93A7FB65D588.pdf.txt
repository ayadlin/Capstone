Abstract
Cancer molecular heterogeneity might explain the variable response of EGFR
mutant lung adenocarcinomas to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We assessed the
mutational status of 22 cancer genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in poor,
intermediate or good responders to first-line gefitinib. Clinical outcome was correlated
with Additional Coexisting Mutations (ACMs) and the EGFR Proportion of Mutated
Alleles (PMA). Thirteen ACMs were found in 10/17 patients: TP53 (n=6), KRAS (n=2),
CTNNB1 (n=2), PIK3CA, SMAD4 and MET (n=1 each). TP53 mutations were exclusive
of poor/intermediate responders (66.7% versus 0, p=0.009). Presence of ACMs
significantly affected both PFS (median 3.0 versus 12.3 months, p=0.03) and survival
(3.6 months versus not reached, p=0.03). TP53 mutation was the strongest negative
modifier (median PFS 4.0 versus 14.0 months). Higher EGFR PMA was present in
good versus poor/intermediate responders. Median PFS and survival were longer
in patients with EGFR PMA ≥0.36 (12.0 versus 4.0 months, p=0.31; not reached
versus 18.0 months, p=0.59). Patients with an EGFR PMA ≥0.36 and no ACMs fared
significantly better (p=0.03), with a trend towards increased survival (p=0.06). Our
exploratory data suggest that a quantitative (PMA) and qualitative (ACMs) molecular
heterogeneity assessment using NGS might be useful for a better selection of patients.

Introduction

traditional platinum-based chemotherapy [1-5]. A recent
meta-analysis confirmed that EGFR mutant NSCLC
patients derived a significant progression-free-survival
(PFS) advantage from TKIs over platinum-doublet
chemotherapy as first-line treatment, although a significant
differential benefit may be observed according to smoking
status (HR for never-smokers 0.29 versus 0.54 for eversmokers; p < 0.007) and to the type of EGFR mutation

Randomized clinical trials conducted in non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying activating mutations
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have
clearly shown that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
dramatically contribute to improve prognosis, disease
control, symptoms and quality of life when compared to

(HR for exon 19 deletion 0.25 versus 0.44 for exon 21
substitution; p < 0.001) [6].
Therefore, the anti-EGFR TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib
and afatinib are currently employed for the treatment of
patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring
EGFR activating mutations. However, the duration of
response is variable and almost 25% of patients rapidly
progress during treatment, many at the first disease
assessment time-point. The question arises whether
there are additional candidate clinical and/or molecular
predictive factors permitting a further selection (‘superselection’) of patients with EGFR mutated cancers to
implement prediction of the awaited TKIs efficacy and
identify those patients not beneficiating from TKIs despite
the presence of the EGFR alteration.
The onset of resistance seems to represent an
inevitable consequence of targeted therapies in solid
tumors. Classically, the resistance develops after an
initial response to therapy (acquired resistance) and may
be pharmacological (failure of delivery of the drug to its
target) or biological, primarily deriving from the activation
of coexisting pathways, bypassing the oncogenic
dependency of a given driven alteration [7].
Although the widely validated role of the EGFR
T790M mutation as the main mechanism of acquired
resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib [8, 9], the reliable
impact of this genetic alteration at diagnosis is still
debatable, relying on contradictory data regarding its
true incidence and clinico-biological role. The rate of
pretreatment T790M mutation is strongly dependent on
the sensitivity of the detection method (ranging from 2%
to 35%) [10, 11]. Recently, Costa et al. detected a high
frequency (65%) of coexisting EGFR T790M before
treatment, using a highly sensitive method based on
laser microdissection and peptide-nucleic acid-clamping
PCR [12]. The presence of a pretreatment T790M EGFR
mutation seems to be associated with worse clinical
outcomes (in term of objective response and PFS) to
EGFR TKIs compared with patients with classic EGFR
activating alterations without any detected T790M
mutation [13, 14].
Other genetic abnormalities and signaling pathways
are currently under investigation because of their potential
implication in the development of TKIs resistance. TP53
represents the most frequently mutated gene in lung
cancer, occurring in over half of adenocarcinoma, 80%
of squamous cell carcinoma and 70% of small-celllung cancer [15]. Although the prognostic role of TP53
is still debatable, some preclinical data seem to suggest
an intriguing predictive influence of TP53 mutation.
In this regard, the persistent STAT3 activation has been
observed in the residual survivor lung cancer cells both
in vitro and in vivo under targeted TKIs, suggesting that
early STAT3 phosphorylation may represent an important
transcriptional programming event prior to the resurgence
of resistant tumor survivors [16]. Moreover, TP53 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PTEN knowkdown synergize to activate pro-inflammatory
interleukin-6/STAT3/nuclear factor kB signaling generating
highly metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionlike cancer stem cells. The constitutive activation of this
loop leads to the suppression of SOCS3 (suppressor of
cytokine signaling 3), a critical negative regulator of proinflammatory pathways, suggesting interesting connection
between inflammation and carcinogenesis [17].
Several clinical approaches can help to maintain
the disease control in the resistance setting, including
the use of radiation to treat isolated areas of progression
(classically the central nervous system) and switching
to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Moreover, novel approaches
have already demonstrated a strong signal of activity,
such as the development of second-generation and thirdgeneration inhibitors and the combination of some of
these inhibitors with antibodies directed against the same
target. In this continuously evolving setting, the increased
understanding of the spectrum of resistance is mandatory
to make progress in clinical research [18].
Recently, many new facets emerged, highlighting
the fact that EGFR mutations may be potentially targeted
even with drugs without a peculiar EGFR action, such
as bisphosphonates [19] and ibrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine
kinase and BMX inhibitor) [20], that have demonstrated
activity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, including
erlotinib-resistant tumors. Other promising data suggest
the fact that the EGFR mutation may represent a
genetic biomarker predicting enhanced sensitivity to
topoisomerase II inhibitor (such as etoposide), in response
to a methyltransferase EZH2 inhibitor, supporting the
biological rationale underlying the possibility of a
combined approach with these molecules [21]. With regard
to the hypothesis of a multi-targeted approach, another
recent preclinical analysis demonstrated that adding
chloroquine (acting as an autophagy inhibitor) to EGFR
and AKT inhibition might potentially improve tumor
responses in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells [22]. Several
experimental approaches, such as the establishment of
pooled short-hairpin RNAs library screen, are currently
under investigation to identify promising drugs and
pathways for further study in EGFR mutant NSCLC,
including TKIs-resistant NSCLC [23].
Tumor heterogeneity strongly contribute to primary
resistance. The demonstration that human cancers are
frequently represented by a molecular mosaic of cells,
spatially and temporally different, derived from several
genomic studies (reviewed in [24]). Next-generation
sequencing approaches in renal and pancreatic cancers
have demonstrated the existence of a strong heterogeneity
among different regions within the same tumor and
between the primary tumor and metastasis [25, 26].
The codification of tumor heterogeneity, improving
the understanding of the oncogenic mechanism inclusive
of the totality of the genomic and epigenomic processes,
may help to identify clinically relevant subgroups of

patients, leading to a better management of the therapeutic
resistance to targeted agents.
In this context, the assessment of molecular
heterogeneity with the innovative multigene next
generation sequencing (NGS) technology may help to
concurrent screen for additional genetic abnormalities
potentially deputed to drive cancer predictive testing
for therapeutic decisions [27]. The implications for
future research are challenging: the EGFR mutated
dosage as well as coexisting mutations could become a
new predictive tool for lung cancer patients and new
technologies, such as NGS, may potentially be introduced
in routine practice.

among poor and intermediate patients and lacked in good
responders (66.7% versus 0%, p[Fisher]=0.009) (Figure
1, Panel A).
A paradigmatic case of a poor responder patient
with a clear molecular heterogeneity is shown in Figure
1 (panels B-C) where an EGFR deletion in exon 19
in an area of the lesion presenting a well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma (panels B-2 and C-3) is associated
with a concomitant TP53 mutation (R248W) in a more
dedifferentiated area (panels B-1 and C-3); both mutations
were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing (Figure 1, Panel
C-4).
No significant difference according to PMA in term
of PFS was found (PMA ≥ 0.36, median PFS 12.0 months,

versus PMA < 0.36, median PFS 4.0 months, 95% CI 1-9;

comparison with those 9 with a ACM≥1 (median PFS

of 5.07 (95% CI 0.99-26.03; p=0.052) (Figure 2, Panel D).
A significant difference in favor of the 11 patients
with wild type TP53 (median PFS 14 months, 95% CI

(p=0.02), with a HR of 4.66 (95% CI 1.12-19.37; p=0.03)
(Figure 3, Panel A). With regard to OS, no significant
difference according the presence of p53 status was found
(wild type TP53, median OS not reached; 1-year OS
71.7%, 2-year OS 52.0% versus mutant TP53, median OS

Results
Eighteen patients from two institutions, whose
characteristics are reported in Table 1, were studied.
Median age was 71 years (range 37-83). Smokers were
significantly more represented in the poor group than in the
others (66.7% versus 10.0%, p[Fisher]=0.04). Seventeen
patients were evaluable for PFS at least at first evaluation.
At a median follow-up of 8 months (range: 1-33), 14
events of progression and 7 deaths were recorded. None
of the patients had rearrangements of the ALK gene. Six,
3 and 8 patients were grouped as poor, intermediate and
good responders, respectively, according to the treatment
resistance to gefitinib and PFS (Table 2). The median PFS
was 1.7, 6.1 and 17.3 months for poor, intermediate and
good responders, respectively (p < 0.0001, Table 2).
The proportion of cancer cells carrying mutated
EGFR was calculated on the basis of the output of NGS
analysis that furnishes the proportion of the mutated
alleles (PMA), i.e., the number of mutated alleles over
the total alleles analyzed. Thus, as the alleles in a cell are
two, the proportion of cancer cells carrying a mutated
allele is generally the double of the PMA indicated by
NGS analysis, and referred to a cancer cellularity of at
least 60% obtained through microdissection. As for EGFR
mutations, median PMA was 0.2 (range 0.12-0.36), 0.16
(range 0.15-0.65) and 0.35 (range 0.17-0.61) for poor,
intermediate and good responders, respectively. A nonsignificant trend between the good responder group and
the 2 others was found in median PMA (0.35 versus 0.21,
p[t-student]=0.08; p-value[Mann-Whitney]=0.16). A rate
of 0.36 for PMA was identified at the ROC analysis as the
best cut-off to split patients according to PFS.
Thirteen mutations in addition to the one in EGFR
were found in the TP53 (n=6), KRAS (n=2), CTNNB1
(n=2), PIK3CA, SMAD4 and MET (n=1 each) gene. All
mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. None of
the patients had more than 2 concomitant mutations. The
association of additional mutations and prognostic groups
are reported in Table 3 and Supplementary Table 1. TP53
mutations (median PMA 0.45) were exclusively found

Our study on a series of EGFR mutant advanced
lung cancers receiving 1st line Gefitinib suggests that the
presence of ACM significantly decreases the expected
benefit of TKIs.
Among the identified ACMs, TP53 mutations
were exclusively documented among poor/intermediate
responders than in good responders (66.7% versus 0%,
p=0.009), suggesting the potential implication of this gene
in influencing the chance of response to the anti-EGFR
agents. In lung cancer, TP53 represents the most frequently
mutated gene, occurring in over half of adenocarcinoma,
80% of squamous cell carcinoma and 70% of small-celllung cancer [15], and, despite debated [28], it has been
suggested as an independent marker for shorter survival
in advanced NSCLC. A recent evidence demonstrated that
not all TP53 mutations are equal: non-disruptive TP53
mutations (those preserving some functional properties of
the protein) represents an independent prognostic factor
of shorter survival in advanced NSCLC (13.3 versus 24.6
months; HR=2.08; p < 0.001) [29].
In contrast to EGFR-activating mutations, KRAS

1.0-6.0; 1-year PFS 19.4%, 2-year PFS 10%) was found
(p=0.03), with a HR of 3.26 (95% CI 0.78-10.85, p=0.054)
(Figure 3, Panel C). With regard to OS, a trend towards
significance in favor of patients with an PMA ≥ 0.36
and ACM=0 (median OS not reached; 1-year OS 86.0%,
2-year OS 68.6%) in comparison with patients with an
EGFR PMA < 0.36 and ACM ≥ 1 (median OS 4.0 months,
95% CI 1-18; 1-year OS 50.5%, 2-year OS 25.0%) was
found (p0.06), with a HR of 4.01 (95% CI 0.78-20.59,
p=0.10) (Figure 3, Panel D).

Discussion
Despite exploratory and unpowered for conclusive
interpretations, the results reported herein indicate
that the application of NGS technology may furnish a
baseline genetic portrait of advanced NSCLC that gives
information on the presence of actionable and additional
mutations that may impair the efficacy of targeted
therapies. A prospective validation in a large set of patients
is required to corroborate our results.

of EGFR mutant patients that were smoker, suggesting
a potential correlation between smoking status and the
presence of ACMs.
Our data may contribute to generate hypotheses
with regard to the biological intrinsic difference between
primary and acquired resistance, being the latest event
supported by a series of data indicating the EGFR
T790M mutation as the more common mechanism of
acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib [8]. Indeed,
approximately 50-80% of rebiopses of EGFR-mutant
patients progressing under the selective pressure of
EGFR TKIs display this kind of mutation [8, 9]. Globally
considered, our results support the hypothesis that TP53
(and perhaps other tumor suppressor genes) may affect
the efficacy of the traditional target therapy in molecularly
addicted patients, thus triggering cell proliferation
stimulus, and bypassing the oncogenic power of the EGFR
pathway.
In this population carrying ‘bad’ genetic alterations,

mutations are usually detected in smokers, and associated
with poor prognosis and no benefit from TKIs and
adjuvant chemotherapy. However, some evidences are
available regarding the coexistence of KRAS and EGFR
mutations, raising questions about the relative values
of these genetic abnormalities as predictors of outcome
in NSCLC [30]. Marchetti et al. reported that patients
carrying both mutations were resistant to TKIs and showed
a shorter survival compared with those patients with only
EGFR mutations, suggesting that the biological power
determined by the presence of KRAS mutation, even if
only in minor cellular clones, may potentially overcome
the dependence to EGFR [31].
EGFR mutations are very uncommon among
smokers and former smokers, enforcing the rationale that
coexisting mutations may feature the disease. From a
purely speculative point-of-view, we observed that 4 out
of 6 TP53 mutations, KRAS mutations (n=2) and the MET
mutation (n=1) have been detected in the smaller group

concurrently with the classical EGFR-activating
mutations, the employment of a combination strategy of
chemotherapy and target agents may preserve a clinicobiological rationale. Although no benefit was demonstrated
for adding TKIs to chemotherapy (INTACT-1 and 2 [32,
33], TRIBUTE [34] and TALENT trials [35]), intercalated
erlotinib to cisplatin or carboplatin demonstrated a
significant benefit in the context of an EGFR mutationpositive subgroup (FASTACT-1 and 2) [36, 37], although
these evidences warrant to be replicate in the context of
non-asian patients’ populations.
In addition to this ‘qualitative’ analysis exploring
the number of ACM, we tried to determine if the
‘quantitative’ analysis of the EGFR mutation (PMA)
might have a role in influencing the efficacy of TKIs.
These data allow speculating upon the exploration of
those key processes critical to the tumor development and
progression, as the tumor heterogeneity.
With regard to the ‘quantitative’ analysis of the
EGFR mutation, Zhou et al. firstly hypothesized that
the quantification of EGFR mutations might predict the
extent of EGFR TKIs benefit, demonstrating an advantage
in term of PFS for those patients with high abundance of
EGFR mutations (detected concurrently with two methods
with a different sensitivity) [38]. Our results support this
hypothesis, although, given the limited number of patients,
only a weak trend in favor of those patients with a high
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PMA (≥ 0.36) was found.
Nevertheless, given the intrinsic differences in the
adopted EGFR detection methods, the reliability of the
observed evidences and their overall conclusions must be
considered purely speculative for further research in this
regard. Indeed, as recently demonstrated by Tseng et al., a
significant portion of responses to erlotinib in EGFR wildtype patients was related to the limitations of detection
methods (both direct sequencing and mutant type-specific
sensitive methods) [39].
Although no detailed study on tumor heterogeneity
have been published in lung cancer, several data regarding
the complexity of the molecular background of lung
cancer are available. From the morphological perspective,
the most recent clinico-pathological classification of lung
adenocarcinoma identifies multiple histologic subtypes,
frequently co-existing in the same tumor [40]. From the
genomic standpoint, recent data demonstrate the high
mutational rate of lung cancer, supporting the hypothesis
of a strong heterogeneity [41, 42]. Nevertheless, a
series of data suggest that the mutational load of lung
adenocarcinoma in non-smoker patients (where the
chance of detecting the EGFR mutation is the highest)
is significantly lower [43], and that few (but critical)
mutations may be enough to switch cells from normal to
malignant [44].
While conflicting evidences exist regarding the
12790

Oncotarget

discordance rate of EGFR mutation status between
primary tumors and metastases, a substantial consistency
supports the lack of a reliable heterogeneity of EGFR
mutations at the intratumor level [24]. Recently, Wright
et al. analyzed different areas in the context of a series
of lung adenocarcinoma specimens and found that
KRAS and BRAF mutations were confined to high-grade
morphological domains, while the EGFR mutations were
identifiable through all histological subtypes in the tumor
according to the driver status of the mutations [45].
Globally considered, these results suggest that
the heterogeneity of a driver-gene mutation, such as
that of EGFR in lung cancer is a rare molecular event.
However, the alterations in the target gene itself (affecting
the delivery of the drug to its target) and the concurrent
activation or suppression of other signaling pathways
(relevant for tumor progression and survival), may justify
the heterogeneity in term of the clinical benefit deriving
from the employment of target agents.
The data emerging from our analysis support
the potential role of the NGS technology in the deeper
analysis of the molecular background, also in the context
of a recognized oncogene-addicted disease, with the
ideal aim to further improve the EGFR mutant patients’
selection. Our group already highlighted the basic
contribution of NGS technique in the development of
the translational research in the diagnostic field, able to
provide, with limited amounts of the biological material
(DNA), reliable quantitative and qualitative data, critical
for the application of the tailored medicine [46].
Together with other emerging scientific evidences,
our analysis may represent a proof-of-principle study
supporting the existence of a tumor heterogeneity which,
from now on, should be considered clinically relevant and
deserving to be deepened for clinical validation [47]. In
this new era of precision medicine, our study highlights
the potential strong contribution to the understanding
of the molecular bases of cancer yielded by NGS
technologies, which may allow to provide a ‘qualitative’
(presence of ACM) and ‘quantitative’ (PMA) measure
of the tumor heterogeneity [48]. In this regard, the found
genetic portrait of cancer cells may mirror the underlying
tumor heterogeneity, thus allowing to ultra-stratifying
those EGFR mutant NSCLC patients, and estimating a
differential clinical benefit of anti-EGFR TKIs in such
already-selected subpopulation.

with deep sequencing technology. In all cases, a formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor excisional/
trans-bronchial biopsy was available. Patients were
retrospectively grouped according to time to progression
during gefitinib treatment in: poor responders (progression
at first tumor response assessment), intermediate
responders (progression within 12 months), and good
responders (progression or treatment still ongoing after 12
months). The principal aim of the study was to correlate
the activity of gefitinib (in terms of treatment resistance
and Progression-Free Survival, PFS) with: 1) the
proportion of cells carrying the EGFR mutation, calculated
on the basis of the value of the proportion of mutated
alleles (PMA) that is derived from NGS analysis readout
[Quantitative analysis], and 2) the presence of Additional
Coexisting Mutations [ACM] (other than EGFR mutation)
[Qualitative analysis]. All the samples were received
anonymously and processed at the Molecular Pathology
Unit of the Department of Pathology and Diagnostics of
the University of Verona.

Tissue microdissection and DNA preparation
Four 10-µm paraffin sections were manually
microdissected to ensure that each tumor sample contained
at least 60% of neoplastic cells. DNA was isolated using
the QIAmp DNA FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen) and quantified
and its quality assessed using NanoDrop® (Invitrogen
Life Technologies; Milan, Italy) and Qubit® (Invitrogen

Briefly, 10 ng of purified genomic DNA were used for
library construction with the Ion AmpliSeq Colon and
Lung Cancer Panel v2 (Life Technologies) that targets
504 mutational hotspot regions of the following 22
cancer-associated genes, in alphabetical order: AKT1,
ALK, BRAF, CTNNB1, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4,
FBXW7, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, KRAS, MAP2K1,
MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, SMAD4, STK11,
TP53. Emulsion PCR was performed either manually
or with the OneTouch DL system (Life Technologies).
The quality of the obtained library was evaluated by
the Agilent® 2100 Bioanalyzer on-chip electrophoresis
(Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA). Sequencing
was run on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine™
(PGM, Life Technologies) loaded with a 316 chip as
per manufacturer’s protocol. Data analysis, including
alignment to the hg19 human reference genome and
variant calling, was done using the Torrent Suite
Software v.3.2 (Life Technologies). Filtered variants were
annotated using both the Ion Reporter software v1.2 (Life

Descriptive statistics was used to summarize
pertinent study information. Follow-up was analyzed and
reported according to Shuster[50]. The correlation between
variables were analyzed according to chi-square, Student’s
t, and Mann–Whitney (nonparametric) tests. The PMA
value for each patient was normalized taking into account
the rate of cellularity of malignant cells for each sample.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
was adopted for dichotomization of continuous variables
according to outcome [51]. The hazard ratio (HR) and the
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was estimated for each
variable using the Cox univariate model[52]. Progressionfree- and Overall-survival (PFS and OS) were calculated
by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method from the date
of treatment start until progression or death for any cause.
The Log-rank and Tarone-Ware analyses were adopted
to assess differences between curves. Significance was
defined at the p < 0.05 level. The SPSS® (18.0) licensed
statistical program was used for all analyses.
