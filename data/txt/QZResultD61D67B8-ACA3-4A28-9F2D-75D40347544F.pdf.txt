ABSTRACT
The fucoidan with high anticancer activity was isolated from brown alga Fucus
evanescens. The compound effectively prevented EGF-induced neoplastic cell
transformation through inhibition of TOPK/ERK1/2/MSK 1 signaling axis. In vitro
studies showed that the fucoidan attenuated mitogen-activated protein kinases
downstream signaling in a colon cancer cells with different expression level of TOPK,
resulting in growth inhibition. The fucoidan exerts its effects by directly interacting
with TOPK kinase in vitro and ex vivo and inhibits its kinase activity. In xenograft
animal model, oral administration of the fucoidan suppressed HCT 116 colon tumor
growth. The phosphorylation of TOPK downstream signaling molecules in tumor
tissues was also inhibited by the fucoidan. Taken together, our findings support
the cancer preventive efficacy of the fucoidan through its targeting of TOPK for the
prevention of neoplastic cell transformation and progression of colon carcinomas
in vitro and ex vivo.

before invasion and metastasis can occur. On the basis
of this idea, and numerous epidemiological findings,
attention has centred on dietary natural compounds as an
effective intervention in cancer development [1].
A great deal of interest has been developed in the
nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries to isolate
natural biological active compounds from marine
resources. Among marine organisms, brown algae
belonging to Saccharina, Fucus, Alaria, Sargassum,
Undaria, Pelvetia genera have traditionally formed part
of the oriental diet, especially in Asian-pacific region,

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is considered to be a leading cause of death
worldwide despite the intensive efforts and substantial
advances that have occurred through focusing on
improving treatments. Recently it was indicated that onethird of all cancer deaths are preventable and that diet is
closely linked to cancer prevention. Chemoprevention may
be defined as the use of non-toxic substances, including
many food factors and natural compounds to interfere
with the process of cancer development or carcinogenesis

while the purified gelling and thickening ingredients are
predominant as food products of algal origin in European
countries and USA. Nowadays, algae have been marketed
worldwide as constituents of dietary supplements due
to their antimutagenic, anticoagulant, and antitumor
properties as well as the high content of so-called dietary
fiber [2]. Brown algae are known to produce a range of
active components including unique secondary metabolites
such as phlorotannins and polysaccharides, namely
alginic acids, laminarans, and sulfated polysaccharides
(fucoidans). The fucoidans are shown to be a topic of
numerous studies as nontoxic compounds, possessing wide
spectrum of biological activities [3, 4]. The fucoidans from
different species of brown algae have been found to inhibit
carcinogenesis in variety of cancer cells, including gastric
adenocarcinoma [5], prostate cancer [6], melanoma [7],
hepatocellular carcinoma [8], breast cancer [9], and colon
cancer cells [10].
The key molecular mechanism of anticancer effect
of the fucoidans is the induction of apotosis through
caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways
[11–14]. Moreover the fucoidans were shown to suppress
tumor growth by inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis
and metastasis [15]. The mechanism by which the
fucoidans inhibited these processes has not been clearly
elucidated. Probably, the fucoidans are responsible for
the reduction of activities of Matrix Metalloproteinases
(MMPs) and the decrease of Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor (VEGF) expression with subsequent inhibition of
invasion and suppression of tubules formation in tumor
cells [16–18].
While the development of research efforts
involving structure of the fucoidans and their biological
activities are advancing, the understanding of molecular
mechanisms of their action is still incomplete. Moreover,
a direct molecular target of the fucoidan from brown
alga Fucus evanescens has not been identified in vitro or
ex vivo.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MAPKK) signaling pathway is a major component of the
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis which is activated
by a multitude of extracellular stimuli, including a variety
of tumor promoters; and they participate in the regulation
of a host of cellular functions such as transformation,
proliferation and growth, cell movement, differentiation,
and death [19].
The Lymphokine-activated killer T-cell-originated
protein kinase (TOPK) is a serine-threonine kinase, a
member of MAPKK family. TOPK was confirmed to
highly express in many cancers such as lymphoma,
leukemia, melanoma, colorectal, breast, lung cancer, and
cholangiocarcinoma [20–22]. In addition, TOPK may
contribute to oncogenic cellular functions including tumor
development, cancer growth, and antiapoptotic effects [23–
25]. On the basis of the above the TOPK kinase is certain
to be a potential target for development of anticancer
agents.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate
molecular mechanism of chemopreventive effect of the
fucoidan from brown alga Fucus evanescens and identify
its direct molecular target.

RESULTS
The fucoidan inhibits EGF-induced neoplastic
transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells through TOPK/
ERK1/2/MSK 1 pathway
The carcinogenesis is multistage process, including
initiation, promotion, and progression [26]. One of the
perspective approaches for cancer therapy is search and
development of nontoxic compounds, which are effective
in preventing of cancer initiation.
The promotion-sensitive mouse epidermal cells
JB6 Cl41 are known to respond irreversibly to tumor
promoters such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) with
induction of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar
[27, 28]. That is why this well-established culture system
was used to identify effect of the fucoidan from brown
alga Fucus evanescens (FeF) on EGF-induced neoplastic
cell transformation.
FeF (Figure 1A) was shown to inhibit EGF-induced
neoplastic transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells in dosedependent manner. FeF at concentrations 100, 200, 400
μg/mL decreased the number of transformed cells on
30, 35, 60%, respectively (Figure 1B). It should be noted
that the chemopreventive effect of FeF was not due to
its cytotoxicity, because it did not possess cytotoxicity
at concentration range up to 1 mg/mL even in 3 days of
treatment (Figure 1C).
To
elucidate
molecular
mechanism
of
chemopreventive effect of FeF we tested MEK1/2/TOPK/
ERK1/2/MSK 1 pathway, which is link extracellular
signals to the machinery that controls fundamental cellular
processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation,
migration and apoptosis [29, 30]. Therefore, herein we
investigated the effect of FeF on the phosphorylation
of MEK1/2, TOPK, ERK1/2, MSK 1 kinases in JB6
Cl41 cells. The FeF was found to inhibit EGF-induced
phosphorylation of TOPK, ERK1/2, and MSK 1, but
not MEK1/2 kinase. FeF did not influence expression of
MEK1/2, TOPK, ERK1/2, and MSK 1 total protein level
(Figure 1D).

The fucoidan inhibits colony formation of colon
cancer cells
Previous studies suggested that TOPK is highly
activated in human colon cancer [20]. Therefore, in our
study to determine the effect of FeF on colony formation
we used colon cancer cell lines HCT 116, HT-29, and
WiDr with high, middle, and low expression level of
TOPK, respectively (Figure 2A). Cells were maintained
18764

with different concentrations of FeF (0 – 400 μg/mL)
and colony numbers were counted after culturing for 14
days. The results showed that the fucoidan at 100, 200,
and 400 μg/mL inhibited colony formation of HCT 116
on 35, 57, and 58%; HT-29 cells on 21, 31, and 36% and
WiDr on 6, 14, and 16%, respectively, compared with nontreated cells (Figure 2B–2D). Overall, our results suggest
that inhibitory effect of FeF on colony formation was
significant in HCT 116 cells with high expression level
of TOPK.
In addition, to examine the mechanism explaining
the chemopreventive effect of FeF on colony formation of
colon cancer cells, Western Blotting was used to evaluate
the effect of FeF on phosphorylation of MEK1/2, TOPK
and its downstream targets, including the phosphorylation
of histone H2AX, ERK1/2, and MSK 1 proteins in HCT
116 cells, which were relatively more sensitive to FeF. As
expected, phosphorylation of TOPK and down-regulated
kinases was inhibited dose-dependently, but not MEK1/2

(Figure 3). It should be noted that FeF did not influence
expression of MEK1/2, TOPK, ERK1/2, and MSK 1 total
protein level.

The fucoidan inhibits TOPK kinase activity
in vitro
We next investigated whether the fucoidan might
influence kinase activity of TOPK for the inhibition of cells
transformation. Data from in vitro kinase assays indicated
that FeF decreased TOPK kinase activity (Figure 4A). FeF
at concentrations of 200 or 400 μg/mL inhibited TOPK
kinase activity on 28% or 64%, respectively.

The fucoidan specifically binds with TOPK
in vitro and ex vivo
The results above showed that the inhibition of

formation of colon cancer cells by FeF involves the
suppression of TOPK kinase activity and, subsequently,
TOPK downstream signaling pathways. To determine
whether FeF exerts its effects by directly interacting with
TOPK, we performed pull-down assay using insoluble
fucoidan (IFeF) and TOPK-Ni-NTA-agarose beads. We
found that TOPK associated with IFeF in vitro (Figure 4B,
lane 3) and ex vivo (Figure 4C, lane 3), but not with BaSO4
beads alone (Figure 4B, 4C, lane 2). Moreover FeF was
proved to bind with TOPK-Ni-NTA-agarose beads
(Figure 4D, lane 5), but not to Ni-NTA-agarose alone

kg of body weight) by oral injection, 3 times a week for
20 days. The treatment of mice with 1, 10, and 50 mg/
kg of body weight of FeF was found to inhibit HCT 116
tumor growth by 2, 37, and 72%, respectively, compared
with vehicle-treated group (Figure 5A, 5B). It was also
shown that mice treated with FeF did not lose body weight
compared with vehicle-treated group, which indicated that
the dose of FeF used for the experiment had no toxicity to
the mice (Figure 5C).
To check whether the antitumor effect of FeF was
associated with its inhibition of TOPK activity, tumor
tissues from each group were prepared after 20 days of
treatment and analyzed for phosphorylation of TOPK
downstream targets (p-ERK1/2 (Tyr202/Tyr204) and
p-histone H3 (Ser10)) by H&E and immunohistochemistry
analyses. The results revealed that expression of p-ERK1/2
and p-histone H3 was decreased after treatment with FeF
at either 10 or 50 mg/kg of body weight compared with
the control group (Figure 5D). Our data confirm that the
fucoidan from brown alga F. evanescens suppresses tumor
growth by inhibiting TOPK activity ex vivo.

In order to determine the antitumor activity of FeF
ex vivo, HCT 116 colon cancer cells were innoculated
into the right flank of individual athymic nude mice. Then
mice were administered vehicle or FeF (1, 10 or 50 mg/

DISCUSSION

prevention of angiogenesis and invasion in fibrosarcoma
cells [9–18]. However the molecular mechanism of cancer
preventive effect of the fucoidans and, moreover, their
direct molecular targets has not been identified in vitro or
ex vivo.
The MAP kinases comprise a family of proteins
that mediate a succession of discrete signaling cascades.
These signaling cascades are activated by a multitude
of extracellular stimuli, including a variety of tumor
promoters; and they participate in the regulation of a host
of cellular functions such as proliferation, cell movement,
differentiation, senescence, and death [19]. T-LAK celloriginated protein kinase (TOPK) is a novel serinethreonine kinase that is a member of MAPKK family and
is involved in many cellular functions, including tumor
development, cell growth, apoptosis, and inflammation
[20, 37–39]. Thus, TOPK is found to be a potential
target for development of anticancer agents. Our results
showed that FeF at nontoxic doses effectively suppressed
EGF-induced transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells that was
accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of TOPK

The fucoidans, sulfated polysaccharides, are
constituents of brown algae and some marine invertebrates
(such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers) [31, 32]. The
fucoidans isolated from different species of brown algae
have extremely diverse chemical structure. And biological
activity of the fucoidans was proved to depend on their
structural characteristics [33, 34]. The fucoidan from
brown alga Fucus evanescens (FeF), studied in this work
consists of alternating (1→3)- and (1→4)-linked α-Lfucopyranose residues, sulfated and partially acetylated
at C2 and/or C4 positions [35, 36]. For the past decade
the fucoidans isolated from different species of brown
algae have been extensively studied due to their varied
biological activities including anticoagulant, antivirus,
antitumor,
immunomodulatory,
anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, and anticomplementary activities [3, 4].
In vitro, several mechanisms have been postulated to
underlie the anticancer activity of the fucoidans including
induction of apoptosis in different types of cancer cells and

(Thr9), ERK1/2 (Tyr202/204) and MSK 1 (Thr581),
but not MEK1/2 (Ser221), which suggested that FeF
attenuated EGF-induced cell transformation by inhibiting
of TOPK activity. TOPK/ERK1/2/ MSK 1 pathway is
likely to play an important role in the cancer preventive
activity of FeF. To the best of our (admittedly limited)
knowledge, the effect of algal fucoidans on neoplastic
cell transformation was not investigated in detail with
the notable exception of our works [40, 41], in which
the fucoidans were effective in inhibiting EGF-induced
cell transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells. The inhibition
was found to be associated with the inhibitory effects of
polysaccharides on AP-1 activity. However the antitumor
activity is known to depend on the structure of the
fucoidans, therefore we can affirm that FeF has a unique
molecular mechanism of cancer preventive action, which
is necessary to be elucidated.
Because TOPK is highly activated in colon cancer
cells we checked the idea whether FeF could suppress
colony formation of colon cancer cells. In our study we
compare the effect of FeF on anchorage-independent
growth of colon cancer cells with different level of TOPK
expression. It was shown that the fucoidan effectively
suppressed colony formation of colon cancer cells HCT
116 with high expression level of TOPK and had less
effect on HT-29 and WiDr cells with middle and low
TOPK expression level, respectively. The fucoidan was
confirmed to inhibit activity of TOPK, The fucoidan was

confirmed to inhibit phosphorylation of TOPK (Thr 9),
and suggesting fucoidan may inhibit upstream kinase of
TOPK, such as Erk-2 (Figure 1D and Figure 3). Further
study is needed to explore the effect of fucoidan on
feedback loop between TOPK and Erk2 or other upstream
kinases of TOPK.
We first determined that FeF could potently suppress
TOPK kinase activity in vitro. We further conducted
in vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays and confirmed
the direct binding between FeF and the TOPK kinase.
Recently it was shown that TOPK inhibitor HI-TOPK-032
strongly suppressed TOPK kinase activity and inhibited
anchorage-dependent and -independent colon cancer cell
growth by reducing ERK-RSK phosphorylation as well as
increasing colon cancer cell apoptosis through regulation
of the abundance of p53, cleaved caspase-7, and cleaved
PARP [42]. However in our study the inhibitory effect
of natural compound from brown alga on TOPK was
demonstrated for the first time.
Importantly, it was shown that FeF inhibited growth
of HCT 116 colon tumor in xenograft animal model. The
chemopreventive effect of FeF seemed to be associated
with inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
histone H3, direct downstream signaling targets of
TOPK. The obtained data strongly indicate that the
chemopreventive effect of the fucoidan from brown alga
F. evanescens in vitro corresponds closely with the results
ex vivo.

In summary, we provided evidence showing
that natural sulfated polysaccharide from brown alga
Fucus evanescens effectively suppresses EGF-induced
transformation of mouse epidermal cells JB6 Cl41 and
colony formation of colon cancer cells through TOPK/
ERK1/2/ MSK 1 signal pathway by inhibiting TOPK
kinase activity in vitro and ex vivo. Overall, our findings
support the cancer preventive efficacy of the fucoidan
through its targeting of TOPK for the treatment of colon
carcinomas.

leupeptin, 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyluoride (PMSF),
1 mM dithiolthreitol (DTT) containing 1% Triton X-100).
Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000
rpm for 15 min, and protein’s content was determined
using Bradford reagent “Bio-Rad” (Hercules, California,
USA). Lysate protein (20-40 μg) was subjected to 10%
sodium-dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS PAG)
and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (PVDF) “Millipore” (Billerica, MA,
USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
milk for 1 h and then incubated with the respective specific
primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Protein bands were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent
(ECL Plus) after hybridization with a HRP conjugated
secondary antibody. Band density was quantified using
the ImageJ software program (NIH).

Mouse epidermal JB6 Cl41 cells (ATCC # CRL2010) and human colon cancer cells HCT 116 (ATCC #
CCL-247™), HT-29 (ATCC # HTB-38), WiDr (ATCC
# CCL-218™) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
Mouse epidermal JB6 Cl41, human colon cancer
HCT 116, HT-29, and WiDr cells were cultured in
MEM/5% FBS, DMEM/10% FBS, McCoy’s 5 A/10%
FBS, and RPMI-1640/10% FBS media, respectively.
The cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

MTS assay
To estimate cell viability, JB6 Cl41, HCT 116,
HT-29 or WiDr cells (8 × 103/well) were seeded in 96well plates for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator. The
attached cells were fed with fresh medium containing
various concentrations of the fucoidan from brown alga
F. evanescens (FeF) (0-1000 μg/mL) for additional 24, 48,
72 h. After culturing for various times, the cytotoxicity
of FeF was measured using an MTS assay kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. All the experiments
were performed in triplicate, and the mean absorbance
values were calculated. The results are expressed as the
percentage of inhibition that produced a reduction in
absorbance by the fucoidan’s treatment compared to the
non-treated cells (control).

In vitro kinase assay
Inactive ERK2 proteins (1 μg) were used as the
substrate for an in vitro kinase assay with 1.5 μg of active
TOPK. Firstly, active TOPK was incubated with FeF (200
and 400 μg/mL) in 1× kinase buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 7.5),
5 mM b-glycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),
0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM MnCl2) at
32°C for 15 min. Then inactive ERK2 and 100 mM ATP
were added to reaction and incubated at 32°C for 1.5 h.
Reactions were stopped by adding 5× SDS sample buffer
and then were analyzed by Western blotting. Band density
was determined by GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer and
quantified using “Quantity One 1-D analysis” software
(“Bio Rad”, USA). The percentage of inhibition of kinase
activity by FeF was calculated compared with control
(sample with TOPK active and ERK2 inactive).

Anchorage-independent growth assay
(soft agar assay)
JB6 Cl41 cells (2.4 × 104) were exposed to EGF (10
ng/mL) and treated with FeF (0 – 400 μg/mL) in 1 mL of
0.3% Basal Medium Eagle (BME) agar containing 10%
FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 25 μg/mL gentamicin. The
cultures were maintained at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 incubator
for 14 days, and the cell’s colonies were scored using a
microscope «Motic AE 20» (China) and the Motic Image
Plus computer program.
To estimate the effect of FeF on colony formation,
HCT 116, HT-29 or WiDR (2.4 × 104) were treated with
FeF (0 – 400 μg/mL) in 1 mL of 0.3% Basal Medium Eagle
(BME) agar containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and
25 μg/mL gentamicin. The cultures were maintained in a
37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 14 days, and the cell colonies
were scored as described above.

Preparation of water-insoluble fucoidan (IFeF)
FeF (1 mL, 10%, w/v) was mixed with BaCl2
(1  mL, 10%, w/v) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The
pellet was washed three times with 96% ethanol. The
precipitated insoluble fucoidan (IFeF) was dried at room
temperature [41].

In vitro and ex vivo IFeF pull-down assays
Human TOPK (1 μg) was incubated with IFeF pellet
(1 mg) (or BaSO4 alone as a control) in 1× reaction buffer
(50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
DTT, 0,01% NP40, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.02
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitors)
with gentle rocking overnight at 4°C. The samples were
washed five times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris (pH
7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01%
NP40, 0.02 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and
TOPK bound to IFeF was analyzed by Western Blotting

Western blotting
After cells (6 × 105) were cultured in a 10-cm
dish overnight, they were treated with FeF (0-400 μg/
mL) for 48 h. Then the cells were starved in serum-free
medium for another 12 h and treated with EGF (10 ng/
mL) for 15 min. The harvested cells were lysed with

with the primary antibody against human TOPK. For the
ex vivo pull-down assay, HCT 116 cell lysate (500  μg)
were incubated with IFeF (1 mg) (or BaSO4 alone as a
control) in 1× reaction buffer. After incubation with gentle
rocking overnight at 4°C, the pellet was washed 5 times
with washing buffer and proteins bound to IFeF was
analyzed by Western Blotting as previously described.

Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University.
Mice were divided into different groups (n = 6 of each
group). HCT 116 colon cancer cells (3 × 106/0.1 ml
1×  PBS) were injected subcutaneously into the right
flank of each mouse. FeF (1, 10, and 50 mg/kg of body
weight) or vehicle was administered by oral injection
three times a week for 20 days. Tumor volumes and body
weights were measured every other day. The volume (V)
of the tumor was calculated using the formula: volume
(v) = 0.52 (length (l) × width (w) × height (h)). Treated or
non-treated groups of mice were euthanized and tumors
extracted. Colon cancer tissue slides were prepared with
paraffin sections after fixation with formalin and then
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining or
p-ERK1/2 (Tyr202/Tyr204) and p-histone H3 (Ser10).

Bacterial expression and purification
of pET46-TOPK (His-TOPK)
The topk gene was amplified by PCR and then
cloned into pET-46 using a pET-46 Ek/LIC kit (Novagen,
USA). His-TOPK fusion protein was expressed in BL21
(DE3) bacteria (Novagen, USA). Bacteria was grown at
37°C to an absorbance of 0.9 - 1.0 at 600 nm and induced
with 0.5 mM IPTG overnight at 15°C and harvested by
centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 50 mM
Tris (pH 8.0) lysis buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and
10 mM imidazole. After sonication and centrifugation, the
supernatant fraction was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose
beads “Qiagen” (Germany) overnight at 4°C. Beads were
washed with lysis buffer and PBS and used for binding
assay as 50% slurry.

Statistical analysis
All assays were performed at least in triplicate. The
results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD). A Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the data with
the following significance levels: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001.

FeF (1 mg/mL) was incubated with TOPK-NiNTA-agarose beads (or Ni-NTA-agarose beads alone as a
control; 200 μL, 50% slurry) in the reaction buffer (50 mM
Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,
0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin,
0.02 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/mL
protease inhibitor mixture). After incubation with gentle
rocking overnight at 4°C, the beads were washed 5 times
with washing buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride).
The binding between the TOPK-Ni-NTA-agarose
beads and FeF was examined by color reaction with
toluidine blue stain. Firstly, FeF (control) and TOPK-NiNTA-agarose-FeF complex were applied to the agarose
gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis was carried out in
Tris-borate buffer pH 8.3 (0.09 M Tris, 0.4 M H3BO3, 0.01
M EDTA) at 25 mA for 2h. The gel was stained with 0.025
% solution of toluidine blue in acetic acid. Band density
was determined by GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer and
quantified using “Quantity One 1-D analysis” software
“Bio-Rad” (Hercules, California, USA).
