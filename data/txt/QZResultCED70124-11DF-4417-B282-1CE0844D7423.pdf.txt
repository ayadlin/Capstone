Abstract
The drug efﬂux function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by MDR1 can be inﬂuenced by genetic polymorphisms, including two synonymous changes in the coding region of MDR1. Here we report that the conformation of
P-gp and its drug efﬂux activity can be altered by synonymous polymorphisms in stable epithelial monolayers
expressing P-gp. Several cell lines with similar MDR1 DNA copy number were developed and termed LLC-MDR1WT (expresses wild-type P-gp), LLC-MDR1-3H (expresses common haplotype P-gp), and LLC-MDR1-3HA
(a mutant that carries a different valine codon in position 3435). These cell lines express similar levels of
recombinant mRNA and protein. P-gp in each case is localized on the apical surface of polarized cells. However,
the haplotype and its mutant P-gps fold differently from the wild-type, as determined by UIC2 antibody shift
assays and limited proteolysis assays. Surface biotinylation experiments suggest that the non-wild-type P-gps
have longer recycling times. Drug transport assays show that wild-type and haplotype P-gp respond differently to
P-gp inhibitors that block efﬂux of rhodamine 123 or mitoxantrone. In addition, cytotoxicity assays show that the
LLC-MDR1-3H cells are more resistant to mitoxantrone than the LLC-MDR1-WT cells after being treated with a
P-gp inhibitor. Expression of polymorphic P-gp, however, does not affect the host cell's morphology, growth rate,
or monolayer formation. Also, ATPase activity assays indicate that neither basal nor drug-stimulated ATPase
activities are affected in the variant P-gps. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate that "silent" polymorphisms
signiﬁcantly change P-gp function, which would be expected to affect interindividual drug disposition and
response. Cancer Res; 74(2); 598–608. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
MDR1 [P-glycoprotein (P-gp), ABCB1] is one of the major
drug transporters found in humans. This gene encodes P-gp, an
efﬂux transporter in the plasma membrane that actively
transports a broad range of drugs in an ATP-dependent
manner (1). It is found in multiple organs (2), and is expressed
in the trophoblast layer of the placenta during pregnancy (3).
Mice carrying null abcb1a and abcb1b genes are viable, but

have altered pharmacokinetics of many drugs that are P-gp
substrates (4–6). American collies carrying truncated MDR1
genes have lower tolerance to vincristine and the deworming
agent ivermectin, a substrate of P-gp (7, 8). Overexpression
of P-gp is a common cause of acquired drug resistance in
cultured cancer cells (9–13). In polarized epithelia, P-gp is
located on the apical membrane, facilitating transport in a
directional manner (14, 15).
P-gp contains 2 important functional domains: the substrate binding site and the ATPase domain. It is well documented that mutations in these domains change P-gp function
(reviewed in refs. 16 and 17). In humans, the MDR1 gene is
highly polymorphic, with at least 50 coding single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) in the MDR1 coding region documented.
In particular, 3 SNPs at positions 1236C>T, 2677G>T, and
3435C>T, which form the most common haplotype, have been
studied extensively (16, 18–20). Since the ﬁrst report showing
the alteration of P-gp function with these SNPs (18), many
studies have been done to deﬁne the inﬂuence of these
SNPs individually, or of the complete haplotype. However, the
results of these population-based studies are indecisive, possibly because of variations in terms of experimental settings
including inadequate population sizes to assure statistical
signiﬁcance, incomplete sequence of individuals, differences

Effect of Coding Synonymous Polymorphisms on MDR1

in tissue-speciﬁc P-gp expression, and other unknown environmental factors (21).
The synonymous SNP 3435C>T, usually part of the haplotype noted above, plays an inﬂuential role in P-gp function,
including elevated digoxin, cyclosporin A (CsA), and fexofenadine bioavailability (22–24). Our previous study using a vaccinia virus–based transient expression system showed that
wild-type P-gp and its haplotype are different in function (25).
We also suggested that differences in protein characteristics of
3435C>T, such as those mentioned earlier, might be related to
the introduction of a rare codon that alters the translational
rhythm and folding of P-gp. However, there are technical
limitations in vaccinia virus–based high-level transient expression systems that led us to conduct transport studies and
protein stability experiments in polarized cells. To study
haplotype P-gp and compare its function with wild-type P-gp
under conditions more physiological than those in the transient expression experiments, we developed stable cell lines in
which the human MDR1 gene and its variants were translated
from recombinant DNA and inserted into genomic DNA in a
subclone of LLC-PK1 cells that can form polarized monolayers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and materials
The LLC-PK1 cell line was obtained from American Type
Culture Collection, and maintained in Medium199 þ 3% (v/v)
FBS þ 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The recombinant cell lines
were incubated in the same medium with 500 mg/mL geneticin.
KB-3-1, KB-V1, and KB-8-5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium þ 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 C with 5% CO2 and relative
humidity maintained at 95%.
Cell culture media and geneticin were purchased from
Invitrogen. Biotin, paraformaldehyde, verapamil, vinblastine,
rodamine 123, calcein-AM, mitoxantrone, trypsin, soybean
trypsin inhibitor, MTT, and valinomycin were obtained from
Sigma. Bodipy-FL–vinblastine was obtained from Molecular
Probes. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England
Biolabs. The antibodies were purchased from the following
companies: DAKO (C219, MRK16), Invitrogen (IgG2a-Alexa
Fluor 488, CY3-streptavidine), eBiosciences (UIC2-PE, 17F9,
IgG2a-HRP; Strepavidin-PE), and Jackson Immuno Research
(IgG2a-FITC). ECL reagents were obtained from GE Healthcare. 125I-iodoarylazidoprazosin (125I-IAAP; 2,200 Ci/mmol)
was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.
Preparation of pcDNA-MDR1 constructs
Details about the preparation of constructs can be found in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Generation of LLC-MDR1 cell lines
Generation of cell lines is detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis
Total protein extraction from cell culture and protein concentration estimation methods were reported previously (26).

www.aacrjournals.org

For SDS-PAGE, protein samples (50 mg) were loaded onto a 3%
to 8% Tris-acetate gel (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by iBlot (Invitrogen).
The membrane was blocked in PBS þ 20% milk and incubated
overnight with C219 antibody (1:2,000) followed by incubation
with anti-IgG-2a-HRP antibody and ECLþ (GE Healthcare).
Southern blot analysis
Total genomic DNA was extracted using a GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Sigma). Total DNA (50
mg) and pcDNA-MDR1 (1236C-2677G-3435C; as copy number
standard) were digested with NdeI for 24 hours and separated
in a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA in the gel was denatured and was
transferred onto a Hybond-XL membrane (GE Healthcare).
The membrane was washed brieﬂy with 2  saline-sodium
citrate (SSC) and soaked with hybridsol in 42 C for 2 hours. A
NdeI-digested DNA [32P]-labeled DNA probe was prepared by
Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Kit (GE Healthcare) and was
added on the membrane for 16-hour incubation at 42 C. The
membrane was washed with 2  SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 C for
30 minutes, 2  0.1  SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 C for 10 minutes. The
image was recorded by a phosphoimager and was analyzed by
ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).
TaqMan qRT-PCR
Expression levels of human MDR1 genes were measured
using the TaqMan method. One microgram of total RNA,
isolated by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), was used to
synthesize cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was mixed with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen), run on an ABI
Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Invitrogen) as
per the manufacturer's instructions. Porcine plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 gene (PMCA4) was used as the
reference gene.
Confocal microscopy
Cells were grown on Transwell 3470 membrane inserts
(Corning) until conﬂuent. Tight cell monolayers were ﬁxed by
treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, then
incubated with PBS þ 1 mmol/L MgCl2 þ 0.1 mmol/L CaCl2 þ
1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour. To label P-gp, cell
monolayers were incubated with MRK16 (1:100) for 1 hour,
followed by incubation with anti-IgG2a-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody. To label nuclei, cells were incubated with 4',6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; 300 nmol/L). For cell surface labeling,
biotin was incubated for 15 minutes before cell monolayers
were ﬁxed. Strepavidin-PE (1:100) was added to the ﬁxed cell
monolayers for 1 hour. Fluorescence images were acquired
with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope, and the images
were analyzed by LSM Image Browser (version 4.2.0; Zeiss).
Cell growth assay
Cells were seeded on 60-mm culture dishes and cultured at
37 C. Starting from day 3 after cell seeding, 3 dishes of cells
from each cell line were trypsinized. Cell numbers were
recorded daily until day 14. Cell counting was measured by
the AutoT4 cellometer (Nexcelom Bioscience).

Cell surface immunolabeling by ﬂow cytometry
Cell surface P-gp expression was detected by incubating
cells with 1 mg of MRK16, UIC2, and 17F9 antibodies per
200,000 cells for 30 minutes. For experiments using CsA
(10 mmol/L), cells were preincubated with drug for 10
minutes. After primary antibody incubation, cells were incubated with anti-mouse IgG2a FITC-conjugated antibody for
40 minutes.
Drug inﬂux/efﬂux assay
Actively growing cells (2  105) were harvested by trypsinization and were incubated in Iscove's modiﬁed Dulbecco's
medium (IMDM) þ 5% FBS medium, with rhodamine 123
(0.5 mg/mL), mitoxantrone (5 mmol/L), or bodipy-FL–vinblastine (0.5 mmol/L) in the presence or absence of CsA (10
mmol/L), DCPQ (50 nmol/L), Tariquidar (50 nmol/L), verapamil (5 mmol/L), digoxin (125 mmol/L) at 37 C. Cells were
washed and further incubate with IMDM or IMDM with drugs
for 40 minutes before FACS analysis.
Limited trypsin digestion assay
Limited protein digestions by trypsin were performed with
crude membranes. Three micrograms of the crude membranes
were treated with different concentrations of trypsin for 5
minutes at 37 C. The reaction was stopped with 5  excess of
soybean trypsin inhibitor. Remaining P-gp was detected by
Western blot analysis using C219 antibody.
Cell surface P-gp biotinylation
For cell surface biotinylation, cells were washed with ice cold
PBS, and then incubated with 0.2 mg/mL EZ-Link Sulfo-NHSLC-Biotin (Thermo Scientiﬁc) in ice-cold PBS for 30 minutes.
Excess biotin was washed with glycine/PBS and PBS. For ﬂow
cytometry analysis, cells were trypsinized, washed, and incubated with MRK16 þ IgG2a-FITC (0.5 mg per 200,000 cells) þ
CY3-streptavidine (1:50). Labeling of cells with sulfo-NHS-LCbiotin just before trypsinization was considered as time 0. The
percentage of biotinylated P-gp remaining at each time point
was determined by measuring the percentage of biotinylated Pgp cells remaining compared with the number of biotinylated
P-gp cells at time 0. Data calculations were performed by
CellQuest software BD Biosciences.
Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of drugs on LLC-MDR1 cells was measured
by a colorimetric viability assay using MTT as previously
described (26). Cytotoxicity (IC50) was deﬁned as the drug
concentration that reduced cell viability to 50% of the untreated control.
Crude membrane preparations and ATPase assays
The crude membranes from cells were prepared as described previously (27). ATPase activities were measured as
reported previously (28). Brieﬂy, crude membrane protein
(10 mg protein per 100 mL) was incubated at 37 C for 30
minutes in 100 mL of reaction buffer (50 mmol/L MOPS-KOH,
pH 7.5, 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L sodium azide, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L ouabain, 10 mmol/L MgCl2) in the presence

600

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

and absence of 0.3 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate (Vi).
The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mmol/L ATP
for 20 minutes at 37 C. SDS solution (2.5%, v/v) was added
to terminate the reaction, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was quantiﬁed with a colorimetric reaction,
as described previously (28). The basal P-gp ATPase activity
was determined by subtracting the ATPase activity in the
P-gp–containing membranes with the ATPase activity in the
control membranes in the same experiment. Drug-stimulated
P-gp ATPase activity was measured in an ATPase reaction
mixture that contained 2.5 mmol/L paclitaxel, 10 mmol/L
vinblastine, 10 mmol/L valinomycin, and 30 mmol/L verapamil,
and the activity obtained was corrected for the basal ATPase
activity.
Photoafﬁnity labeling with 125I-IAAP
Photoafﬁnity assays were performed by incubating crude
membranes (1 mg/mL) with drugs for 10 minutes at room
temperature in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 followed by the
addition of 3-6 nmol/L [125I]-IAAP (2,200 Ci/mmol). The samples were cross-linked and incorporation of [125I]-IAAP was
determined as described previously (29).
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance of the experimental results was
obtained by the 2-sample t test. Results were considered
statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
Characterization of LLC-PK1 cell lines expressing wildtype, haplotype, and mutant P-gps
To characterize the effect of P-gp variants, stable cell lines
expressing human P-gp were developed. The original LLC-PK1
cell line, isolated from porcine kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (30), expresses a low level of P-gp (31). Taking this
into consideration, the LLC-PK1 subclone termed LLC-PK1#7
was prepared by clonal selection. LLC-PK1#7 has undetectable endogenous P-gp and is unable to efﬂux P-gp substrates
including rhodamine 123 and calcein-AM (data not shown).
The MDR1 wild-type [pTM1-MDR1(1236C-2677G-3435C)],
haplotype [pTM1-MDR1(1236T-2677T-3435T)], and a MDR1
haplotype mutant encoding the isoleucine at 1145 using a rarer
tRNA [pTM1-MDR1(1236T-2677T-3435A)] were used for this
study. After transfection, LLC-PK1 clones were isolated and
grown under the same culture conditions. During establishment of stable cells, we did not select P-gp expression
with P-gp substrates such as colchicine or vinblastine to
prevent endogenous P-gp induction and/or alteration of
other endogenous resistance mechanisms (32, 33). We designated the cell lines in this study as follows: LLC-vector
(vector-transfected cells), LLC-MDR1-WT [MDR1(1236C2677G-3435C)-expressing cells], LLC-MDR1-3H [MDR1
(1236T-2677T-3435T)-expressing cells], and LLC-MDR1-3HA
[MDR1(1236T-2677T-3435A)-expressing cells]. As shown in Fig.
1A, all the P-gp–expressing cell clones, numbered 1 to 4, have one
copy of MDR1 cDNA. qRT-PCR analysis determined that
the transfected DNA expressed a comparable level of MDR1

transcripts (Fig. 1B, 2–4). Recombinant P-gp expression was
identiﬁed by Western blotting using C219 antibody. In Fig. 1C,
P-gp was not detectable in the LLC-vector cells (lane 1), but was
evident in the P-gp–expressing cells (lanes 2–4). P-gp in all P-gp–
expressing LLC-PK1 cell lines was found as a single band with an
apparent molecular weight of 160 kDa and no immature bands
were detected (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1). The P-gp
protein from LLC-MDR1-WT cells had lower mobility than the Pgp expressed in High-Five insect cell membranes, indicating that
P-gp is likely N-glycosylated in the LLC-PK1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The N-glycosylation pattern of the different P-gps may
differ, because we observed that the WT-P-gp (Fig. 1C, lane 2)
had slightly higher mobility than the 3H-P-gp (Fig. 1C, lane 3) and
the 3HA-P-gp (Fig. 1C, lane 4). P-gp–expressing cell lines
expressed high levels of P-gp and all the clones expressed

comparable levels. P-gp expression in the KB-V1 cells (Fig. 1C,
lane 5) was greater than in KB-8-5 cells (Fig. 1C, lane 6), as
expected.
We compared the growth rate of the LLC-PK1 cell lines. The
cells were allowed to grow in culture dishes for 2 weeks until
conﬂuency. The growth curves indicated that these cell lines
had similar growth rates (Fig. 1D).
To determine whether P-gp polarization could be affected
by P-gp polymorphisms and synonymous mutations, cell surface immunolabeling was performed on LLC-PK1 cell monolayers. Cells were grown in Transwell chambers until cell
monolayers were formed. Light microscopy images showed
no signiﬁcant morphologic differences among the tested
cell lines (Fig. 1E, top). Using confocal microscopy, in the
P-gp–expressing cells, P-gp signals (green) were detected on

the apical side, but not in the vector-transfected stable cells
(LLC-vector). WT-P-gp, 3H-P-gp, and 3HA-P-gp expression
on the apical membranes were comparable (Fig. 1E, middle).
On the basolateral side, as expected, P-gp was undetectable
(Fig. 1E, bottom). These results indicate that in the LLC-PK1
cells, P-gp polymorphisms do not affect protein expression
or targeting to the apical cell surface.
MDR1 mutations alter P-gp conformation in the LLC-PK1
cells
To determine whether polymorphisms of MDR1 could
change protein conformation, we examined the LLC-MDR1
cell lines with the conformation-sensitive antibody UIC2. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the vector cells showed minimal reactivity
toward all antibodies tested (black histogram). The wild-type
and haplotype P-gp–expressing cells showed high and comparable reactivity with conformation-insensitive MRK16 and

17F9 antibodies. However, these P-gp–expressing cells showed
differential reactivity with UIC2 and with UIC2 in the presence
of CsA (10 mmol/L).
To further examine the effect of conformation differences,
the accessibility to various trypsin concentrations of P-gp was
determined. Figure 2B shows Western blots of wild type and
polymorphic forms of P-gp with trypsin. Membrane proteins
from each P-gp–expressing cell line were prepared and they
were digested for 5 minutes with increasing amounts of trypsin, and the remaining P-gp protein was analyzed using C219
antibody. For each protein sample, the concentration of trypsin required for a 50% decrease in P-gp was determined and
plotted. We observed differences in trypsin sensitivity with
LLC-MDR1-WT (most sensitive) < LLC-MDR1-3H < LLCMDR1-3HA. The fold change in IC50 for LLC-MDR1-WT and
LLC-MDR1-3H was 1.2- and 1.4-fold for LLC-MDR1-3HA. In

P-gp synonymous polymorphisms inﬂuence protein
stability
To elucidate the impact of conformation changes of P-gp by
its polymorphisms in LLC-PK1 cells, we determined the halflife of plasma membrane P-gp in LLC-PK1 cell lines by cell
surface biotinylation. Cells were labeled with biotin for 30
minutes and cultured for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cells were
stained with strepavidin-PE and MRK16 antibody. The remaining biotinylated P-gp at each time point was determined by
ﬂow cytometry and a plot was drawn to calculate the time
required for 50% disappearance of biotinylated P-gp (Fig. 2B).
The mean half-lives of plasma membrane P-gp were 45 hours
(LLC-MDR1-WT), 47 hours (LLC-MDR1-3H), and 53 hours
(LLC-MDR1-3HA), respectively (Fig. 3), which are signiﬁcantly
different from each other (P < 0.05), and consistent with the
in vitro trypsin sensitivity experiments shown in Fig. 3.
Synonymous mutations affect P-gp function
The effect of drug transport function of P-gp wild type
and its variants in LLC-PK1 cells was tested using rhodamine 123 with various P-gp inhibitors. In Fig. 4, FACS histograms show transport of rhodamine 123 by cells transfected
with the LLC-vector, LLC-MDR1-WT, LLC-MDR1-3H, and
LLC-MDR1-3HA cells. In the absence of P-gp inhibitors, efﬂux

was the same. Complete inhibition of rhodamine 123 efﬂux was
observed when a high concentration of verapamil (20 mmol/L)
was used (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar observations were
also made for high concentrations of the P-gp inhibitors
tariquidar (200 nmol/L) and CsA (20 mmol/L; data not shown).
However, we observed differential inhibition of P-gp function
when suboptimal inhibitor concentrations were used. For
example, in the presence of 50 nmol/L tariquidar, efﬂux of
rhodamine 123 was least affected in LLC-MDR1-3H cells. Also,
in the presence of 10 mmol/L CsA or 5 mmol/L verapamil, the
LLC-MDR1-3HA cells showed slightly higher efﬂux of rhodamine 123. When we tested the efﬂux of rhodamine 123 in the
presence of digoxin (125 mmol/L), the LLC-MDR1-3HA cells
showed the poorest inhibition to digoxin compared with
the LLC-MDR1-3H cells and the LLC-MDR1-WT cells, consistent with the original clinical observations that the P-gp
haplotype affected digoxin levels in patients (18). These results
suggest that the variant forms of P-gp have different sensitivities to the inhibitors digoxin, CsA, and tariquidar.
The LLC-vector cells were used as a control. This cell line
was not able to efﬂux rhodamine 123, and P-gp inhibitors did

not inﬂuence its accumulation of rhodamine 123 (Figs. 4
and 5, black histogram).
Variant P-gps affect drug efﬂux and cytotoxicity
The stable LLC-PK1 cells expressing human P-gps enabled
us to conduct short-term assays and long-term assays. We
conﬁrmed that WT-P-gp, 3H-P-gp, and 3HA-P-gp expression
levels remain unchanged for at least 96 hours after geneticin
removal (results not shown). Growth assays revealed that
all the LLC-PK1 cell lines tested had comparable growth
rates (Fig. 1D), indicating that these cells are suitable for
cytotoxicity experiments. We tested 2 anticancer drugs that
are P-gp substrates (vinblastine, mitoxantrone) in the presence or absence of P-gp inhibitors (DCPQ, CsA). We compared the efﬂux function of P-gp in different LLC-PK1 cell
lines using drug transport inﬂux/efﬂux assays (short-term)
and growth-inhibition assays (long-term) by the MTT
method. In Fig. 5, the P-gp–expressing cells show different
mitoxantrone efﬂux. The LLC-MDR1-3H cells showed signiﬁcantly higher efﬂux than the LLC-MDR1-3HA and the LLCMDR1-WT cells. This difference correlated with increased

mitoxantrone resistance of the LLC-MDR1-3H and LLCMDR1-3HA cells in the presence of mitoxantrone. The
calculated IC50 values showed that the LLC-MDR1-3H cells
(14.6  1.9 mmol/L) were 10 times more resistant to mitoxantrone (P < 0.001) than the LLC-MDR1-WT (1.5  0.3
mmol/L) cells, and the LLC-MDR1-3HA (9.2  2.5 mmol/L)
cells were 6.3-fold (P < 0.001) more resistant than the wildtype cells (Table 1). Also, the fold differences of the IC50
values of LLC-MDR1-WT versus LLC-MDR1-3H, LLC-MDR1WT versus LLC-MDR1-3HA, and LLC-MDR1-3H versus LLCMDR1-3HA cells were also signiﬁcant. In the presence of
100 nmol/L DCPQ, resistance to mitoxantrone was reversed
in the LLC-MDR1-WT (0.2  0.04 mmol/L) and the LLCMDR1-3HA 0.8  0.2 mmol/L) cells when compared with
LLC-vector cells (0.065  0.015 mmol/L). In the presence of
DCPQ, the IC50 of the LLC-MDR1-3H cells decreased from
14.6  1.9 mmol/L to 3.2  0.6 mmol/L. However, they are
still signiﬁcantly (49.8-fold, P < 0.001) resistant to mitoxantrone compared with the LLC-vector and the LLC-MDR1WT cells (Fig. 5 and Table 1). These experiments suggest that
the LLC-MDR1-3H cells are less sensitive to DCPQ.
The effect of drug efﬂux function by P-gp variants was
tested using vinblastine. For drug accumulation/efﬂux
assays, bodipy-vinblastine was selected as a substrate. The
drug efﬂux assays showed that all the P-gp–expressing cell
lines exported bodipy-vinblastine at the same rate. In
the presence of 5 mmol/L CsA, all the P-gp–expressing cells
showed reduced efﬂux of bodipy-vinblastine. Using MTT
assays, the P-gp–expressing cells had comparable resistance
to vinblastine and no statistical signiﬁcance was found in
IC50 values between LLC-MDR1-WT versus LLC-MDR1-3H
and LLC-MDR1-3HA cells (Fig. 5 and Table 1). In the presence of CsA, the P-gp–expressing cells showed reduced and
comparable sensitivity to vinblastine.
Effect of substrates on P-gp wild-type and haplotype
ATPase activity
The synonymous SNPs 1236C>T and MDR1 3435C>T are
in amino acid codons found in the nucleotide binding
domains (34). To examine whether P-gp conformation could
change drug-stimulated ATPase activity or photoafﬁnity
labeling with a transport substrate, we performed ATPase
activity assays and photoafﬁnity labeling assays. Using membrane protein isolated from LLC-MDR1-WT cells and
LLC-MDR1-3H, the basal rate of ATP hydrolysis could be
increased signiﬁcantly by paclitaxel, vinblastine, valinomycin, and verapamil (Fig. 6A). There were no signiﬁcant
differences between the cell lines in basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activities.
Photoafﬁnity labeling assays with [125I]-IAAP in the presence of tasigna, verapamil, paclitaxel, vinblastine, valinomycin, and tariquidar indicated that all tested compounds except
verapamil could effectively inhibit [125I]-IAAP binding to P-gp
(Fig. 6B). No signiﬁcant differences were found between the
2 cell lines. To further examine the effect of IAAP binding,
experiments showed that the IC50 value of the LLC-MDR1WT cell line was 1.9 mmol/L and that of the LLC-MDR1-3H
cell line was 2.2 mmol/L (P > 0.05).

Discussion
In this study, we developed 4 recombinant P-gp–expressing cell lines to elucidate the effect of synonymous polymorphisms and haplotypes of MDR1. Until recently, the
effect of synonymous mutations has generally been ignored.
Nevertheless, mounting evidence strongly suggests these
polymorphisms can inﬂuence gene function and cellular
activity via multiple pathways (35–38). In fact, Lawrie and
colleagues reported that a signiﬁcant portion of synonymous
mutation sites in Drosophila melanogaster are subject to
strong purifying selection, and the genes harboring these
mutations are related to key developmental pathways (39).

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

In the MDR1 gene, there are 2 synonymous polymorphisms
that frequently occur in certain human populations
(34, 40, 41). Many clinical and in vitro studies have suggested
that the 3435C>T SNP plays an important role in the
function of MDR1. However, the functional effects of synonymous mutations in MDR1 have not been studied to any
signiﬁcant degree except after transient, high-level expression (25). Therefore, we decided to use the LLC-PK1 epithelial cell line, which can form a polarized tight monolayer, to
evaluate the effect of MDR1 synonymous polymorphisms,
and the effects of codon usage.
Our results show that synonymous mutations do inﬂuence
protein stability in intact cells in addition to trypsin sensitivity in vitro as previously reported (25). The MDR1 haplotype causes a change in P-gp conformation, as determined
using cell surface labeling by UIC2, a P-gp conformationsensitive antibody (42). We further showed that the 3435C>A
synonymous mutation increases binding of UIC2 MAb, and
increases resistance to trypsin. The surface protein biotinylation experiments and FACS assays showed the wild-type
P-gp had the shortest half-life (45 hours), followed by the
haplotype (47 hours) and 3HA mutant (53 hours). These
differences are consistent with the protein stability differences demonstrated earlier using the trypsin-sensitivity
assay (25). We hypothesize that the difference in protein
half-life may be linked to protein recycling. Kim and colleagues (43) have reported that P-gp is recycled through a
clathrin-dependent pathway and interacts with the AP-2
adaptor complex. The P-gp variations we are studying might
cause a change in protein conformation involving a tight
turn structure or a di-leucine motif, which interacts with
AP-2 adaptor complexes. Also, our functional assays showed
that, in certain cases, the haplotype mutants are more
resistant to inhibitors because the frequency of haplotype
forms of P-gp varies in different human populations (19, 20).
These results suggest an evolutionary force driving MDR1
to alter its ability to interact with drugs and dietary materials through altered protein conformation resulting from the
haplotype studied here.
However, common synonymous mutations of MDR1 did
not inﬂuence mRNA expression, total protein expression, or
translocation to the apical membrane surface. Also, the presence of P-gp on the cell surface did not affect cell growth or
formation of a tight polarized monolayer. Our observation
does not support some clinical reports suggesting that the
haplotype allele often correlates with lower P-gp expression
(18, 44, 45).
Our cell lines with stable P-gp expression allowed us to
conduct physiologically relevant experiments, including drug
efﬂux assays and cytotoxicity assays. Drug efﬂux assays suggested that the transport function of P-gp variants is dependent on the drug of choice. Our results indicated that P-gp
polymorphisms do not affect rhodamine 123 transport in the
presence of verapamil or CsA. In contrast, the LLC-MDR1-3H
cell line is less sensitive to tariquidar than LLC-MDR1-WT cells.
The LLC-MDR1-3HA cells are more resistant to inhibition by
digoxin than the cells carrying the haplotype and the wild-type
forms of P-gp. Our results with mitoxantrone indicate that the

Effect of Coding Synonymous Polymorphisms on MDR1

drug transport function of P-gp is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
by the synonymous mutations in MDR1. Mitoxantrone is an
anthracene derivative that is a relatively poor substrate of
P-gp. Expression of P-gp is able to reduce mitoxantrone
accumulation and therefore increase cytotoxic resistance
(46). In this study, we found that P-gp polymorphisms directly
affect mitoxantrone efﬂux and cytotoxicity. The exact cause
of these observations is unclear, but we hypothesize that
the conformational differences affect the relative efﬁciency of
substrate and inhibitor binding between wild-type and haplotype-expressing cells.
In this study, the MDR1 1236C>T and 3435C>T SNPs
showed a signiﬁcant impact on the overall folding of P-gp,
and not just a localized effect. These "silent" mutations
encode glycine 412 and isoleucine 1145, which are found in
the ﬁrst and second ATP-binding domains and are
unchanged in the wild-type and haplotype P-gp. These SNPs
do not affect basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activity,
suggesting changes in conformation in these polymorphic
P-gps do not affect ATP binding or hydrolysis (47). These
"silent" polymorphisms do not result in mRNA degradation,
nor do the resulting P-gp conformational changes result
in obstruction in the protein folding pathway (like CFTR),
mis-localization, posttranslational modiﬁcation defects,
protein truncation, and/or misfolding. In fact, P-gp encoded
by the MDR1 common haplotype is expressed properly on
the cell surface, targeted to the apical side in polarized
monolayers, and functions as a drug transporter. Furthermore, some of our results indicate that the function of
haplotype P-gp might be more efﬁcient than the wild-type
P-gp. These results in stably transfected cells strongly
suggest that human P-gp exists in at least 2 conformational
states of equivalent stability. The haplotype form folds
differently than wild-type P-gp (48). It seems that the silent
polymorphisms encode a protein with alternate (or new)
energy minima, similar to the model suggested by Tsai and
colleagues (48). However, the results do not demonstrate the
mechanism of the effect of synonymous mutations on
MDR1. More experiments are warranted to examine various
hypotheses.
In summary, the role of P-gp synonymous polymorphisms
was examined in polarized epithelial cells. We showed that the

synonymous mutations do inﬂuence protein folding and function in stable cells expressing recombinant P-gp. P-gp conformational alterations subtly changed drug efﬂux function
and interaction with P-gp inhibitors. By comparing data from
short-term transport assays and cytotoxicity assays, these
subtle changes signiﬁcantly alter cellular cytotoxicity of
drugs such as mitoxantrone that do not bind tightly to P-gp.
The P-gp–expressing cell lines will help to identify substrates
and inhibitors that are inﬂuenced by the common variants
of P-gp, allowing better predictions about the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates for P-gp, and improved
design of clinical studies that seek to inhibit the function of
P-gp to reverse drug resistance.
