BACKGROUND. Data on the impact of age in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
patients <30 years treated in pediatric and adult trials are scarce.

METHODS. In all, 891 patients <18 years were treated in the pediatric trials AMLBFM 93/98 and 290 adolescents and young adults (>16 to <30 years) in the
AMLCG 92/99 and AMLSG HD93/98A trials. Treatment schedules and dose intensities were comparable.

RESULTS. Initial features and risk factors differed considerably between infants
(<2 years) and older age groups and only slightly between children (2 to <13),

adolescents (13 to <21) and young adults (21 to <30). Treatment results were
most favorable in children (5-year event free survival [EFS]: 54%  3%), slightly
inferior in adolescents (46%  4%, P 5 .03), and unfavorable in young adults
(28%  5%, P 5 .0001). Excluding patients with favorable karyotypes, the results
were similar in infants and children (EFS: 44%  4% and 46%  3%, respectively)

and inferior in adolescents (35%  4%) and young adults (23%  4%). There was

with blasts >5%. The blast count after induction was of no prognostic value in
patients with favorable karyotypes, but a significant risk factor in patients with
other cytogenetics.
CONCLUSIONS. Biologic data differed mainly between infants and older age
groups. When comparing the same age groups, outcome was similar between the
trial groups, which differed from reports concerning acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the prognosis decreased after childhood independent of other risk
factors. This indicates that even in the younger cohorts increasing age may be
an additional unfavorable factor. Cancer 2008;112:562–71.  2007 American

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, age, prognostic factors, childhood, adolescents, young adults.

A

cute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents 15% to 20% of all
childhood leukemias, about 33% of adolescent, and about 50%
of adult leukemias. After a peak during the first 2 years of life the
subsequent low annual incidence of AML slowly increases after 9
years of age (incidence rate 5/1 million in 5–9-year-olds, during
adolescence 9/1 million in 15–19-year-olds).1 In general the biological features besides age of pediatric and adult AML appear to be
similar, but the differences have not been reviewed systematically.
Treatment results in AML have improved during the last 20 years for
all age groups; however, outcome decreases slowly with advancing

age even when risk factors are considered.2 In contrast
to children and adults, data on biological features and
outcome are scarce in the adolescent age group,
which represents only a small group, both in pediatric
and adult trials. Treatment protocols designed for
children and adults often differ in various aspects
from each other, and there are no data elucidating
which kind of therapy could be particularly appropriate for young adults. To evaluate the impact of age we
analyzed the clinical and biological features, treatment modalities, and outcome within different age
groups below 30 years by using a common dataset
from 1 pediatric and 2 adult AML trial groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Entry criteria were: age 0 to 30 years, newly diagnosed AML, treated in the pediatric trials AML-BFM
93/98 (n 5 891, aged <18 years, diagnosed January,
1993, to June, 2003) as well as adolescents and young
adults (>16 to <30 years) of studies AMLCG 92/99
(n 5 182, diagnosed November, 1992 to June, 2003)
and AMLSG HD 93/98A (n 5 108, diagnosed July,
1993 to November, 2004).
Written informed consent was obtained at study
entry. Patients with AML and Down syndrome, myelosarcoma (<30% blasts), acute promyelocytic leukemia, secondary AML, or myelodysplastic syndrome
were excluded. The FAB classification was used for
the initial diagnosis of AML.3–5
Treatment
Treatment schedules and dose intensities of studies
AML-BFM 93/98, AMLCG 92/99, and AMLSG HD93/
98A were mostly comparable (Fig. 1).
For more details of the treatment protocols, see
Creutzig et al., 2001, 2005, 2006 (AML-BFM 93/98),6–8
Büchner et al., 2003 and 2006 (AMLCG 92),9,10
Schlenk et al., 2003 and 2004 (AMLSG HD93),11,12
and Schlenk et al., 2006 (AMLSG HD98A).13 The
main differences concerned central nervous system
(CNS) irradiation, intrathecal therapy (only given in
AML-BFM 93/98), and maintenance (1 year in AMLBFM 93/98 and 3 years in AMLCG 92/99) as well as
risk-adapted introduction of autologous and allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation in the AMLSG
trials. The percentage of patients transplanted from
an allogeneic donor in first complete remission (CR)
was similar in all trials and also similar in the
defined age groups (see below, 7%–11%).
Definitions
Four age groups were defined: infants, < 2 years;
children, 2 to <13 years (because there were signifi-

563

cant differences in biologic parameters between
these age groups14); adolescents, 13 to <21 years;
and young adults, 21 to <30 years.

Methods and Statistics
A common dataset including the initial clinical and
outcome data was the basis for the analysis (Table
1). As risk groups were defined according to different
parameters in the trials, risk criteria based on cytogenetics that are widely accepted were used for stratified and multivariate analysis (favorable cytogenetics:
t(8;21) and inv(16); unfavorable cytogenetics: complex karyotypes, defined as 3 aberrations15 or
monosomy 7; intermediate cytogenetics: normal and
other karyotypes).
CR was defined according to the CALGB criteria.16 Early death (ED) patients were those dying
within the first 6 weeks of treatment. Response after
induction was evaluated by blast count in the bone
marrow (BM) /> 5%. EFS was calculated from the
date of diagnosis to last follow-up or first event (ED,
nonresponse, recurrence, second malignancy, or
death from any cause). Patients who did not attain
CR were considered failures at time zero. Survival
was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date
of death of any cause or last follow-up.
When frequencies were sufficiently large, a v2
statistic was used. Probabilities of survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with standard
errors according to Greenwood and were compared
with the log-rank test. Cumulative incidence functions of recurrence and death in CCR were constructed by the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice
and compared with Gray’s test. Computations were
performed using SAS (v. 9.1, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between November 1992 and 2004 a total of 1181
patients were enrolled; AML-BFM 93/98 trials: 891
patients 18 years, AMLCG 92/99 and AMLSG HD93/
98A trials: 182 and 108 patients, respectively, in the
age group chosen for this analysis (>16 to <30 years).
The median follow-up was 5.4 years.17
Comparison of initial clinical, morphologic, and
cytogenetic data of the patients included in the 6
trials was possible for most features (see Table 1);
however, there were reduced data on CNS involvement in the adult studies because lumbar punctures
were performed only in case of suspected CNS involvement. Initial data in studies AMLCG 92/99 and
AMLSG HD93/98A were similar (data not shown).

Initial clinical data according to age groups are
given in Table 1. Infants showed higher rates of
grade 3/4 performance status and higher white
blood cell count compared with all other age
groups. Initial CNS involvement was more frequent
in infants (19%) than in older children (8%) and
adolescents (11%). In addition, FAB distribution
was quite different in infants who predominantly

(134/222 [60%]) presented with FAB subtypes M5
or M7, compared with 168/959 (18%) in the older
age groups (P [v2] < .0001). However, apart from a
trend toward increasing frequency of FAB M1 and
decreasing frequency of FAB M7 types, there was
no significant difference in FAB distribution in children (2 to <13 years) and patients 13 to <30 years
old.

** In 3 patients the FAB type was unknown.

The favorable karyotypes [t(8;21), inv16] were
rarely seen in infants (7/155 5 4.5%) as compared
with older patients (P [v2] < .0001); most frequently
in the 2 to <13-year-olds (111/345 5 32%), and less
frequent in adolescents (52/207 5 25%) and young
adults (35/158 5 22%, P [v2] .03). In contrast, 11q23
aberrations were frequent in infants (53/155 5 34%)
and less frequent in the other age groups (77/
710 5 11%).
In summary, the initial features and risk factors
were significantly different when comparing infants
with older patients (<30 years) but only slightly different when comparing the age groups 2 to <13, 13
to <21, and 21 to <30 years.

Bone Marrow Blast Cell Reduction After First Induction
Data on BM blast cell reduction after start of induction were available on more than 85% of the patients.
There was an increasing percentage of patients with
>5% BM blasts with increasing age (P [v2] < .0001,
Table 2).
Results According to Overlapping and Nonoverlapping
Age Groups in Trials AML-BFM 93/98, AMLCG 92/99,
and AMLSG HD93/98A
To compare data from similar age groups in pediatric
and adult trials, the results for overlapping and nonoverlapping age groups within the trial groups (pedi-

atric/adult) are given separately in Table 3a. Results
for EFS and survival were comparable in the overlapping age groups (>15 to <21 years) in all trials. In a
Cox regression model including cytogenetic groups
(favorable/unfavorable) and blast count after induction (/>5%) the risk ratio (RR) for the factor ‘trial
group’ was 0.92 (confidence interval [CI] 0.79–1.05).
Therefore, all further results are presented only
according to age groups.

Overall Outcome According to Age Groups (Table 3b)
The CR rate was highest in children (89%) and lowest
in infants and patients older than age 21 (<2 years:
79%, 13 to <21: 82%, 21 to <30: 72%). This was
mainly due to a low rate of nonresponders in the
cohort of 2 to <13-year-old children. Five-year EFS
results were also most favorable in children
(53%  2%), slightly inferior in infants (42%  3%,
Plogrank 5 .0002)
and
adolescents
(45%  3%,
Plogrank 5 .007) and unfavorable in young adults
(28%  3%, Plogrank < .0001, Fig. 2A). Excluding
patients with favorable karyotypes, results were similar in infants and children (EFS 5 44%  4% and
46%  3%, respectively) and inferior in adolescents
(35%  4%) and young adults (23%  4%). Differences in 5-year survival were smaller between the
age groups and mainly seen between young adults
and the younger cohorts (Fig. 2B).

The ED rate was low in all age groups, but
slightly higher in infants, who often presented initially with hyperleukocytosis, a risk factor for ED due
to cerebral hemorrhage.18 The main reason for a better outcome in 2 to <13-year-old children was a
higher CR and lower recurrence rate compared with
other age groups.

There was a trend for higher treatment related
mortality in remission (TRM) which increased with
age (PGray 5 .09, Table 3b).

young adults (Plogrank 5 .04, Fig. 3A). In patients
without favorable cytogenetics there was a trend for
inferior results after childhood (Plogrank 5 .002).
Excluding infants, EFS in patients with > 5% BM
blasts was inferior compared with patients with 5%
blasts after induction (Table 2). In patients with
favorable karyotypes the results were independent
from the BM blasts cell count after induction (EFS:
5% blasts 72%  3% and >5% blasts 65%  10%).
In addition, patients with intermediate or unfavorable cytogenetics showed similar results in case of 5%
BM blasts (EFS 48%  3% and 42%  7%, Fig. 3B).
Presenting with >5% BM blasts after induction
was an adverse factor in patients with intermediate
and unfavorable cytogenetics (EFS 21%  4% and
10%  5%, Fig. 3C).
When combining cytogenetics and data on BM
blasts after induction it was possible to clearly separate 3 risk groups (Fig. 4).

patients with favorable cytogenetics (independent from blast count). Group 2:
patients with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics excluding patients

cytogenetics, see Group 1).

In a Cox regression model including cytogenetic
groups (favorable/intermediate/unfavorable), blast
count after induction (/>5%) and age groups (<2/
21 years), favorable cytogenetics (RR .43, CI 0.32–
0.58), blast count after induction >5% (RR 1.98, CI
1.58–2.47), and age 21 (RR 1.65, CI 1.29–2.12)
remained of prognostic significance. When analyzing
only patients below 21 years of age no increased risk
for a specific age group could be found.

DISCUSSION
The results presented here are based on original data
of AML patients aged <30 from 6 trials performed in
pediatric and adult study groups. The aim was to
assess the possible effect of the biological factor
‘‘age’’ and the clinical factor ‘‘treatment group’’ (pediatric/adult trial) on outcome of patients with AML.
In contrast to data on elderly AML patients, biological parameters in different age groups of young
AML patients are found rarely in the literature. Jeha
et al.19 reported the influence of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in pediatric and adult patients.
Unlike in adults, VEGF and VEGF-R2 levels in pediatric AML patients did not correlate with survival.
Similarly, and likewise contrary to adults, expression
of the multidrug resistance gene (MRD1) failed to
define a poor-prognostic group in childhood AML.20
However, the prognostic value of cytogenetics is well
established in all age groups.21–23

The biologic data differ considerably between
infants and older age groups and only slightly
between children, adolescents, and young adults.
The distribution of cytogenetic aberrations in infants
is different from that in older patients. Infants
showed nearly no favorable aberrations, but frequently 11q23 aberrations and complex karyotypes,
which indicates some similarities with old AML
patients (>60 years).24 Conversely, the percentage of
favorable cytogenetics [t(8;21) and inv(16)] was highest in children (32%) and decreased in the older age
groups (<25%). Interestingly, only t(8;21) was less
frequently seen in adolescents and young adults than
in the 2 to <13-year-old children, but not inv(16).
Survival data for the specific age groups of adolescents and young adults are scarce. Population-based
data from England and Wales showed a 5-year survival
of 46% for 15–29-year-old AML patients (period 1989–
1994). For patients of this age group treated in the
Medical Research Council (MRC) trials AML9 and
AML10, 5-year survival was 55% during the same period.25 Currently, 5-year survival in children enrolled
in clinical trials is in the range of 45% to 60%.26 In the
AML-BFM studies, survival results improved from 49%
(period 1987–1992) to 60% (period 1993–1998).7 For
adults <50 years of age treated in the AMLCG trials
the overall survival was 50% without significant differences between the different age decades.27
There are several reports comparing pediatric
and adult treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) in adolescents that demonstrate a better outcome with the more intensive pediatric protocols.28,29 The same was reported after comparing
adolescents with AML treated on CCG 2891 with intensive timing (1989–1995) and patients of the same
age group treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center on relatively less aggressive adult protocols
(1980–2000). Patient characteristics were similar;
however, 5-year survival in the CCG-trial was 51%
compared with 32% in the adult trial.30
As outcome data strongly depend on treatment,
it is important to evaluate whether different age
groups have been treated similarly. Regarding induction and consolidation the treatment schedules and
dosages of the pediatric trials AML-BFM 93/98 and
the adult AMLCG and AMLSG trials were similar
(Fig. 1).9,11 Accordingly, the overlapping age groups
treated in pediatric and adult trials showed similar
outcome. The CR rate was highest in the age group 2
to <13 and lower in infants and patients of older
age. Also, long-term treatment results were most
favorable in 2 to <13-year-old children (5-year EFS:
54%  3%),
slightly
inferior
in
adolescents

Age Groups in AML <30 Years/Creutzig et al.

(46%  4%, P 5 .03), and unfavorable in young
adults (28%  5%, P 5 .0001). The same decline in
results with increasing age was seen when risk factors were considered.
Results on BM blasts after induction showed 1)
an age-related increased percentage of patients
with >5% blasts and 2) inferior outcome in all
groups of patients with >5% blasts except in infants.
EFS was especially poor in young adults with >5%
blasts after induction (Table 2). Kern et al.31 reported
that early blast clearance by remission induction
therapy was a major independent prognostic factor
for achievement of CR and long-term outcome in
adult AML. They found no correlation between outcome and blast clearance within the cohorts with
favorable karyotypes, a finding that was similar in
our analysis: the blast count after induction was only
a significant risk factor in patients with intermediate
or unfavorable cytogenetics.
When comparing the same age groups, differences in outcome were minimal between the trial
groups; however, survival and EFS decreased after
childhood irrespective of other risk factors. Schoch
et al.27 analyzed the effect of age and cytogenetics on
clinical outcome in adult patients (>16 years). They
found that both age and cytogenetics were independent prognostic parameters in AML, but up to the
age of 49 years age had no major impact on prognosis, whereas the karyotype did. Our analysis showed
that especially the age group of 21 to 30 years has an
unfavorable outcome that could not be explained by
different therapy intensities; other factors may play a
role, eg, varying therapy compliance with more or
less rigid adherence to the protocol or varying practice of CNS therapy.
A similar observation of an adverse age effect
was reported by Razzouk et al.32 when comparing
patients < 10 years and 10 to 21 years. They concluded that younger children benefit more than older
children from newer intensive therapies.
Register data show a trend to lower survival rates
after the age of 30 when comparing them to the
younger age groups: 44% (0–15 years), 42% (15–29
years), and 32% (30–44 years), time period 1993–1998.1
Data from trials including children, adolescents,
and young adults indicate only small differences
between these age groups: The CCG-2891 trial
included patients <22 years. Five-year survival in 0
to 16 and 16–21-year-old patients treated at intensive
timing chemotherapy was 49% and 51%, respectively.30 The MRC trial AML10 (1988–1995) included
AML patients <35 years on the same treatment regimen. They achieved high CR rates for children <15

569

years (91%) and young adults aged 15–34 (85%). Survival at 5 years was 53% and 60% in children (after
ADE and DAT induction, respectively) and 46% and
47% for the age groups from 15 to 24 and 25 to 34.33
These data do not show the same decrease in the
young adult group that we found in our analysis.
However, similar unfavorable outcome data for
young adults have been reported in more than 1000
Japanese AML patients aged <29 (period 1986–1999)
and treated in a variety of institutions and protocols.
Seven-year EFS was 34% and 32% in the age groups
10 to 15 and 15 to 19, respectively, and decreased to
26% in the 20–29-year-old adults.34
Generally there were similar results in children
and adolescents treated in the same pediatric trial
up to 21 years of age (CCG study), a tendency to inferior outcome after childhood when the same treatment protocol was applied in pediatric and adult
units (MRC trial), and with various protocols in the
Japanese analysis.
Most difficult in the management of adolescents
is the indispensable psychosocial care. The needs of
adolescents differ from those of young children and
arise with the conventional problems that are found
in this age group, eg, need of autonomy and independence, social development, sexual maturation,
education, and employment.35 In view of the specific
needs of adolescents, it is recommended to treat
these patients in special units whenever possible.25
There is also a big difference for children and
adolescents to access treatment in clinical trials,
which might influence prognosis.36,37 In the Nordic
countries and in Germany more than 90% of children <15 years with AML are treated within clinical
trials38,39; in the UK this applies to 67%40 and in the
US to >60%. However, regarding the 15–20-year-olds
or older with cancer, the number of patients enrolled
in clinical trials is much lower.36,37
The data of our pediatric and adult AML trials
indicate that biological factors are similar in children,
adolescents, and young adults. Currently, 5-year survival is in the range of 50% to 60% for patients below
age 21, but inferior in the age group 21 to 30 years
(in the range of 40%). This trend for better survival
rates in the younger age groups can be at least partly
explained by the finding that age is 1 of the independent risk factors.
