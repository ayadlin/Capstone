Mitochondrial metabolism provides precursors to build macromolecules in growing cancer
cells1,2. In normally-functioning tumor cell mitochondria, oxidative metabolism of glucoseand glutamine-derived carbon produces citrate and acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis, which is
required for tumorigenesis3. Yet some tumors harbor mutations in the citric acid cycle
(CAC) or electron transport chain (ETC) that disable normal oxidative mitochondrial
function4–7, and it is unknown how cells from such tumors generate precursors for
macromolecular synthesis. Here we show that tumor cells with defective mitochondria use
glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation rather than oxidative metabolism as the major
pathway of citrate formation. This pathway uses mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of

NADP+/NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and subsequent metabolism of
glutamine-derived citrate provides both the acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis and the 4-carbon
intermediates needed to produce remaining CAC metabolites and related macromolecular
precursors. This reductive, glutamine-dependent pathway is the dominant mode of
metabolism in rapidly-growing malignant cells containing mutations in complex I or
complex III of the ETC, in patient-derived renal carcinoma cells with mutations in fumarate
hydratase (FH), and in cells with normal mitochondria subjected to acute pharmacological
ETC inhibition. Our findings reveal the novel induction of a versatile glutamine-dependent
pathway that reverses many of the reactions of the canonical CAC, supports tumor cell
growth, and explains how cells generate pools of CAC intermediates in the face of impaired
mitochondrial metabolism.

We first studied the metabolism of isogenic 143B human osteosarcoma cells that contained
or lacked a loss-of-function mutation in ETC complex III (cytochrome b-c1 complex). These
cell lines were generated by depleting 143B mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and repopulating
with either wild-type mtDNA or mtDNA containing a frameshift mutation in the gene
encoding cytochrome b (cytb), an essential complex III component8. Despite lack of
respiration and complex III function in the mutants8, both wild-type (143Bwt) and cytbmutant (143Bcytb) cells form colonies in soft agar9 and proliferate at comparable rates
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), making these cells a good model to study growth during
mitochondrial dysfunction. Both cell lines had detectable CAC intermediates, although
citrate was less abundant and succinate was significantly more abundant in the 143Bcytb
cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b). As expected for cells with defective oxidative
phosphorylation, 143Bcytb cells had higher glucose consumption and lactate production
than 143Bwt cells, indicating a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis (Fig. 1a). To
determine the effects of cytb mutation on the metabolic fates of glucose, we cultured both
cell lines in medium containing D[U-13C]glucose and measured 13C enrichment of
intracellular metabolites by mass spectrometry. In 143Bwt cells, most citrate molecules
contained glucose-derived 13C (Fig. 1b). Citrate m+2 results from oxidative decarboxylation
of glucose-derived pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to form [1,2-13C]acetylcoA, followed by condensation with an unlabeled oxaloacetate (OAA). Processing of citrate
m+2 around one turn of the CAC produces citrate m+4 (Supplementary Fig. 2). In 143Bcytb
cells, most citrate contained no glucose carbon (m+0), indicating suppressed PDH
contribution to acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1b). Fumarate and malate m+2 were also decreased
(Supplementary Fig. 1c,d).

Glutamine is a major respiratory substrate in cancer cells, providing energy and anaplerotic
carbon for growth3,10. Both 143Bwt and 143Bcytb cells require glutamine for colony
formation, implying a respiration-independent function for glutamine in cell growth9.
143Bcytb and 143Bwt cells consumed glutamine at similar rates (Fig. 1a). We cultured both
cell lines with L[U-13C]glutamine to define the metabolic fates of glutamine. Similar to
other glutamine-dependent cancer cells11, 143Bwt cells used glutamine as the major
anaplerotic precursor, resulting in a large amount of fumarate, malate and citrate m+4 (Fig.
1c,d; Supplementary Figs. 1e and 3, top). In contrast, 143Bcytb cells produced only trace
quantities of citrate m+4. Instead, they produced citrate m+5 through reductive

carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate (Fig. 1c). This reaction involves addition
of an unlabeled carbon by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) acting in reverse relative to the
canonical oxidative CAC12. Cleavage of citrate m+5 by ATP-citrate lyase then produces
acetyl-CoA m+2 and OAA m+3, with the unlabeled carbon retained on OAA
(Supplementary Fig. 3, bottom). Examination of other CAC metabolites in 143Bcytb cells
revealed that they were formed downstream of citrate m+5 and OAA m+3. These cells
contained abundant malate and fumarate m+3, which was essentially absent from 143Bwt
cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1e). Thus these metabolites are generated from
reductive, rather than oxidative glutamine metabolism (Fig. 1e). Succinate was formed
through both reductive and oxidative glutamine metabolism in 143Bcytb cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1f). Glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation was also observed in
143Bcytb cells cultured in medium containing a full complement of amino acids
(Supplementary Fig. 4), and in cells with a genetic defect in ETC complex I (Supplementary
Fig. 5).

Author Manuscript

To determine which of the three IDH isoforms contributed to reductive carboxylation, we
used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence expression of IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3 in 143Bcytb
cells and measured glutamine-derived 13C labeling in citrate. Silencing either of the
NADP+/NADPH-dependent IDH isoforms, IDH1 or IDH2, reduced citrate m+5 in cells
cultured with L[U-13C]glutamine and silencing both at once further reduced citrate m+5
(Fig. 2a,b). Conversion of glutamine to glutamate was unaffected (Fig. 2b). Silencing IDH3,
the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH-dependent isoform, had no effect on labeling (Fig. 2a,b).
Thus reductive carboxylation in 143Bcytb cells involves IDH1 and IDH2, but not IDH3.
Because IDH1 and IDH2 proteins are localized primarily in the cytoplasm and
mitochondria, respectively, of both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 6), the data suggest that
reductive carboxylation in 143Bcytb cells may occur in either compartment.
To determine whether IDH1 and IDH2 are required for growth, we stably silenced each
enzyme using lentiviral RNAi. In 143Bwt cells, silencing either isoform reduced cell growth
(Supplementary Fig. 7), consistent with findings in other cancer cells with normal
mitochondria13. In 143Bcytb cells, a similar growth reduction occurred when either isoform
was silenced (Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus both IDH1 and IDH2 support growth in cells that
use glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation.

We next determined whether reductive glutamine metabolism contributed to lipogenesis, a
biosynthetic activity required for cancer cell growth. Both 143Bwt and 143Bcytb cells
produced fatty acids de novo, as indicated by incorporation of 3H2O into lipids (Fig. 3a).
The two cell lines were then cultured with 14C-labeled lipogenic substrates to examine
carbon preferences for lipogenesis (Fig. 3a). Both cell lines had an intact pathway of
lipogenesis from exogenously-supplied acetate. The enhanced labeling in 143Bcytb cells
likely resulted from an increased specific activity of the intracellular 2-carbon pool because
of suppressed PDH. Lipids derived from 143Bcytb cells contained little radioactivity from
glucose, but abundant radioactivity from glutamine, indicating a switch in the extent to
which these nutrients supplied lipogenesis. To quantify the contribution of glucose and
glutamine to lipogenic acetyl-CoA, cells were cultured in medium containing either
D[U-13C]glucose and unlabeled glutamine, or L[U-13C]glutamine and unlabeled glucose.

Extracted lipids were analyzed by 13C NMR. Because fatty acids are synthesized by the
sequential addition of 2-carbon units, analyzing 13C-13C coupling between the ω-1 and ω-2
carbons – which enter the fatty acyl chain on different 2-carbon units – enables calculation
of 13C enrichment in lipogenic acetyl-CoA3. In the ω-1 multiplet, 13C-13C coupling
produces a triplet when two 13C-labeled 2-carbon units are added in succession, whereas one
labeled and one unlabeled unit produce a doublet (Fig. 3b). Therefore 13C labeling in
lipogenic acetyl-CoA is proportional to the contribution of the triplet to the overall area of
the ω-1 multiplet. In 143Bwt cells cultured with D[U-13C]glucose, the ω-1 resonance was
dominated by the triplet, which accounted for 65% of the total area (Fig. 3c, left). Glutamine
was a minor source of fatty acyl carbon, as the triplet accounted for only 15% of the area
when the cells were cultured with L[U-13C]glutamine (Fig. 3d, left). This pattern was
reversed in the 143Bcytb cells, with glutamine providing 67% of the lipogenic carbon (Fig.
3c,d, right; Supplementary Fig. 8a). Thus, reductive glutamine metabolism was the major
pathway of fatty acid production in newly-synthesized lipids during 143Bcytb growth.

Although most cancer cells have functional mitochondria, a subset of human tumors harbors
mutations that impair mitochondrial metabolism. Two major classes of mutations occur in
genes required for function of the CAC enzymes succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA-D,
SDHAF2) or fumarate hydratase (FH)14. To test whether glutamine-dependent reductive
carboxylation occurs in tumor cells harboring these mutations, we studied UOK262 cells
derived from a renal tumor in a patient with hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma
syndrome. In this syndrome, affected individuals inherit one loss-of-function FH allele and
their tumors display loss of heterozygosity for the FH locus15. UOK262 cells are defective
in respiration and devoid of FH activity15. They failed to survive culture in glucose-free
medium containing galactose and glutamine (Fig. 4a), a condition that forces cells to use
mitochondrial metabolism to generate ATP16. Lack of FH activity precludes the use of
glutamine as a carbon source in the conventional oxidative CAC. Yet the UOK262 cells
required glutamine to proliferate (Fig. 4b). Culture of these cells with D[U-13C]glucose
produced mass isotopomer data similar to 143Bcytb cells, with minimal formation of citrate
m+2 (Fig. 4c, left). In cells cultured with L[U-13C]glutamine, the most abundant mass
isotopomer of citrate was m+5 formed by reductive carboxylation (Fig. 4c, left). Fumarate
was predominantly formed through oxidative glutamine metabolism, producing fumarate m
+4 (Fig. 4c, middle). However, a large fraction of the malate pool (m+3) was formed via
citrate cleavage and subsequent reductive metabolism (Fig. 4c, right). Lipid labeling using
D[U-13C]glucose or L[U-13C]glutamine revealed that, like 143Bcytb cells, glutamine is the
major carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Thus these cancer
cells produce CAC intermediates using two distinct pathways to compensate for the loss of
FH enzyme activity: oxidative metabolism of glutamine to fumarate, and glutaminedependent reductive carboxylation to produce citrate, acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis, and
remaining 4-carbon CAC intermediates.
Finally, we tested whether glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation was unique to cells
with permanent abnormalities in mitochondrial metabolism. 143Bwt cells and transformed
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were subjected to acute ETC inhibition. Exposure to
inhibitors of complex III (antimycin) or complex I (rotenone) induced a switch from

oxidative to reductive metabolism of glutamine (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 9a). Enhanced
reductive carboxylation was evident one hour after ETC inhibition and was not eliminated
by pre-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Supplementary Fig.
9b,c). Metformin, an antidiabetic agent that inhibits respiration through effects on complex
I17, also induced glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation at high doses (Fig. 4d,
Supplementary Fig. 9a). Interestingly, doses that mimicked plasma concentrations in
patients with acute metformin toxicity and lactic acidosis induced reductive glutamine
metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 10). These data demonstrate that glutamine-dependent
reductive carboxylation is a common cellular response to impaired mitochondrial
metabolism.

Glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation has been described previously as a minor
source of isocitrate/citrate and lipogenic carbon in mammalian cells12,13,18–20. In
Plasmodium falciparum, a unicellular protozoan with limited respiration, the pathway is a
major source of citrate and acetyl units21. We show that this pathway can also function as
the predominant metabolic strategy to produce lipids for cancer cell growth, and can be
induced acutely during ETC inhibition. We speculate that reductive carboxylation is
stimulated by a disturbance in the redox ratio of the mitochondria caused by ETC
impairment, decreasing the NAD+/NADH ratio and rendering oxidative function of the CAC
less efficient. This ratio could be dissipated in part by NAD(P)-transhydrogenases, which
transfer reducing equivalents from NADH to NADPH, and this in turn may drive NADPHdependent reductive carboxylation by IDH1 and IDH2. This redirection of the CAC extends
the versatility of glutamine metabolism in cancer cell growth. In cells with normal
mitochondria, glutamine oxidation is frequently the major source of anaplerosis, providing
most of the carbon to pools of CAC intermediates and facilitating production of
macromolecular precursors in the mitochondria22. Glutamine-dependent reductive
carboxylation enables glutamine to retain this status as a growth-promoting nutrient even
when mitochondrial metabolism is impaired. Therefore, during malignant transformation the
acquisition of somatic mutations that impair mitochondrial function and stimulate aerobic
glycolysis (the Warburg effect) does not diminish the importance of glutamine metabolism
or of the mitochondria themselves for tumor cell proliferation.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

143Bwt and 143Bcytb and UOK262 cells were cultured as described9,15. MEFs were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Hyclone), penicillin/streptomycin and 6mM L-glutamine. Cell growth was monitored
in sub-confluent cultures by trypsinizing and counting with a hemacytometer. Glucose,
lactate, and glutamine were measured as described23. Isotopic labeling was performed in
DMEM with 10% dialyzed FBS supplemented with either 15mM D-[U-13C]glucose or
2mM L-[U-13C]glutamine. Aqueous metabolites were analyzed using an Agilent 6970 gas
chromatograph and an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector. To determine relative
metabolite abundance across samples, the area of the total ion current peak for the relevant
metabolite was compared to that of an internal standard (2-oxobutyrate) and normalized for
protein content. Analysis of 13C enrichment and mass isotopomer distribution was
performed as published11,24. For radioisotope lipid synthesis assays, cells were cultured for

18 hours in complete medium supplemented with 3H2O or 14C tracers (Perkin Elmer).
Lipids were extracted and analyzed as described3. For lipid synthesis experiments using
NMR, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and allowed to proliferate exponentially in medium
containing D[U-13C]glucose and unlabeled glutamine, or unlabeled glucose and
L[U-13C]glutamine until two confluent 15-cm dishes were obtained. Lipids were then
extracted and analyzed by 13C NMR as described3. Gene silencing was performed using
commercial small interfering RNAs (Thermo) directed against IDH1, IDH2 or IDH3. Cells
were transfected with DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Thermo) and protein abundance
was examined after 72 hours using western blots with commercial antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Cells were incubated with L[U-13C]glutamine for two hours prior to
extraction of metabolites for mass isotopomer distribution analysis. Stable silencing used
lentiviral shRNAs from the Mission shRNA pLKO.1-puro library (Sigma). Additional
details are in the online Methods.

or 14C content by scintillation counting. In the 14C experiments, raw counts per thousand
cells were normalized to the absolute rate of fatty acid synthesis established using 3H2O.
*p<0.05, Student’s t-test. b, Schematic outlining synthesis of fatty acids (FA) from acetylCoA (Ac-CoA) and the source of the triplet and doublet at ω-1 in 13C NMR spectroscopy.
c,d, 13C NMR of lipids labeled with D[U-13C]glucose (c) or L[U-13C]glutamine (d). Insets
are expansions of the ω-1 resonance. Abbreviations: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet.

Figure 4. Glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation in renal carcinoma cells lacking
fumarate hydratase and during ETC inhibition in tumor cells with normal mitochondria

Growth of UOK262 renal carcinoma cells in complete medium, in medium in which glucose
was replaced with galactose (a), and in medium lacking glutamine (b). c, Mass isotopomer
analysis of citrate, fumarate and malate from UOK262 cells cultured in medium containing
D[U-13C]glucose and unlabeled glutamine, or L[U-13C]glutamine and unlabeled glucose. d,
Mass isotopomer analysis for citrate, fumarate and malate from 143Bwt cells cultured in
medium containing unlabeled glucose and L[U-13C]glutamine. The labeled glutamine was
introduced at the same time the cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), metformin,
rotenone or antimycin. Metabolites were extracted 6 hours later. In all experiments, data are
the average ± S.D. of three independent cultures.
