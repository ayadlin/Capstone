Abstract
Oxidative stress suppresses host immunity by generating oxidized lipid agonists of the platelet-activating factor
receptor (PAF-R). Because many classical chemotherapeutic drugs induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), we
investigated whether these drugs might subvert host immunity by activating PAF-R. Here, we show that PAF-R
agonists are produced in melanoma cells by chemotherapy that is administered in vitro, in vivo, or in human
subjects. Structural characterization of the PAF-R agonists induced revealed multiple oxidized glycerophosphocholines that are generated nonenzymatically. In a murine model of melanoma, chemotherapeutic administration could augment tumor growth by a PAF-R–dependent process that could be blocked by treatment with
antioxidants or COX-2 inhibitors or by depletion of regulatory T cells. Our ﬁndings reveal how PAF-R agonists
induced by chemotherapy treatment can promote treatment failure. Furthermore, they offer new insights into
how to improve the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy by blocking its heretofore unknown impact on PAF-R activation.

Introduction
Though not the most common type of skin cancer, malignant melanoma is one of the most lethal cancers (1). The
American Cancer Society estimates over 76,000 new patients
were diagnosed with melanoma of the skin, and 9,480 died from
malignant melanoma in 2013 (www.cancer.org/statistics). The
treatment for early-stage (nonmetastatic) melanoma is surgical excision. The treatment of metastatic melanoma is unsatisfactory as this tumor type is relatively resistant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, possibly in part through cellular
resistance to these agents (2, 3). However, regional chemotherapy such as isolated limb chemoperfusion (ILP) with highdose melphalan (10 times more than standard chemotherapy)

for localized disease has proven efﬁcacious, with complete
responses in up to 50% and overall response rates approaching
90% (4–6). Yet, most of these responses are short-lived. Immunotherapy strategies appear to have the most promise for cure
as the immune response is critical for the eradication of this
tumor type (7, 8).
Chemotherapeutic agents are designed to selectively kill
tumor cells, and spare their non-neoplastic counterparts.
Several targets for chemotherapeutic agents exist, including
DNA and/or DNA replication/repair machinery (9). One of the
consequences of many chemotherapeutic agents is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (10–13). Several groups
have demonstrated suppression of host immunity in the
presence of various pro-oxidative stressors through a mechanism involving platelet-activating factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-glycerophosphocholine; PAF). Pro-oxidative stressors including
aromatic hydrocarbons found in jet fuel, cigarette smoke, and
ultraviolet B radiation (UVB; refs. 14–18) generate ROS that can
act directly on glycerophosphocholines (GPC) to produce
oxidized GPC (Ox-GPC), which are potent PAF-receptor
(PAF-R) agonists (18–21). Structural studies using mass spectrometry have identiﬁed more than a dozen Ox-GPC, including
native PAF itself (20–24). There is evidence for hundreds of
these biologically active compounds (22–25) that have
bypassed the tightly controlled enzymatic process of PAF
production (26, 27). Like native PAF, these Ox-GPC are metabolically unstable and their half lives in tissue/blood are
measured in minutes (27, 28).
In addition to the ability of pro-oxidative stressors (e.g.,
UVB) or exogenous PAF-R agonists to inhibit host immunity as
measured by contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses to
either chemical antigens such as 2, 4-dinitroﬂuorobenzene

(DNFB) or delayed type hypersensitivity responses to antigens
such as Candida albicans (14–18, 29), recent studies have
indicated that systemic PAF-R activation can augment experimental tumor growth in a process involving the cytokine IL10
and Tregs (30). PAF-R antagonists have also been demonstrated to protect against UVB-mediated photocarcinogenesis in
mice (31). PAF-mediated systemic immunosuppression
involves IL10 and COX-2–generated eicosanoids with mast
cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as effectors.
As chemotherapeutic agents can induce ROS, the present
studies were designed to test whether chemotherapeutic
agents can generate PAF-R agonists as well as their structural
characterization. Finally, these studies sought to deﬁne whether ROS-generated PAF-R agonists impact chemotherapy
effectiveness. These studies provide the ﬁrst evidence that
chemotherapeutic agents induce systemic immunosuppression via systemic PAF-R signaling in a process that can be
ameliorated via antioxidants and COX-2 inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell lines
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless
indicated otherwise. B16F10 and SK23MEL cells obtained from
ATCC were grown in DMEM high glucose with 10% fetal calf
serum as previously described (30). Cell lines were grown to
approximately 80% to 90% conﬂuence in 10 cm dishes, and
washed three times with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)
and then incubated with 2 mL of prewarmed (37 C) HBSS with
10 mg/mL fatty acid-free BSA with 2 mmol/L of the serine
hydrolase inhibitor pefabloc. In some experiments, antioxidants were preincubated for 60 minutes before addition of
chemotherapeutic agents or DMSO (0.5%) vehicle. The incubations were quenched by addition of 2 mL of ice-cold methanol
followed by methylene chloride, and lipids extracted as
described (17, 18, 20).
Mice. Female C57BL/6-wild-type mice (PAF-R expressing; age 6–8 weeks) were purchased from the Charles
River Laboratories. Age-matched female PAF-R–deﬁcient
(Ptafr/) mice on a C57BL/6 background, generated as
described previously (32), were a kind gift of Prof. Takao
Shimizu (University of Tokyo Department of Biochemistry,
Tokyo, Japan). FoxP3-EGFP reporter mice (33) obtained
from JAX, and FoxP3EGFP mice crossed with Ptafr/ mice
were used in some experiments. It should be noted that
similar effects were noted between Ptafr/ and Ptafr/
Foxp3EGFP mice. Immunodeﬁcient NOD.CB17-PrkdcSCID/J
(Common name: NOD SCID) mice were purchased from the
Indiana University Simon Cancer Center Core facility. In
some experiments, mice were fed with vitamin C-enriched
(10 g/kg; Research Diets, Inc.) and 5 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in water ad libitum for 10 days before intratumoral chemotherapy injection of tumor and until the
termination of the experiment as per our previous studies
(17, 30). All mice were housed under speciﬁc pathogen-free
conditions at the Indiana University School of Medicine. All
procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Indiana University School of Medicine.

Measurement of PAF-R agonists
Calcium mobilization studies. The presence of systemic
PAF-R agonists in lipid extracts derived from the chemotherapeutic agent-treated tumors/cell lines was measured by the
ability of the lipid extracts to induce an intracellular Ca2þ
mobilization response in PAF-R–expressing KBP cells, but not
in KBM cells lacking the PAF-R, as previously described (17, 34).
In brief, KBP and KBM cells were preloaded with the Ca2þ
-sensitive indicator, fura-2-AM (4 mmol/L in HBSS without dye)
at 37 C for 90 minutes, washed, and resuspended in HBSS at
room temperature before use. Lipid extracts from cells or
weighed tumors obtained from groups of chemotherapy versus
vehicle-treated cells/tumors untreated (sham) exposed mice
were added to an aliquot of these cells (1.0–1.5  106 cells/2
mL) in a cuvette at 37 C with constant stirring. The lipid
extracts were normalized to cell number or mg wet tissue
weight or 1/10th volume of perfusate. CPAF and endothelin-1
(ET-1) dissolved in ethanol (adjusted to 1 mmol/L) were used as
positive controls. Fura-2-AM ﬂuorescence was monitored in a
Hitachi F-4010 spectrophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 331 and 410 nm, respectively. The Ca2þ
inﬂux in suspensions was calculated as described (17, 18, 34)
and shown as percentage of maximal peak calcium ﬂux
induced by either CPAF or ET-1.
Mass spectrometry studies. Mass spectrometry was performed on cell lines and perfusion samples using the AB Sciex
triple quadrupole QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer, equipped
with a CTC-PAL autosampler and a Shimadzu HPLC as previously described (24). Please see Supplementary Materials and
Methods for details of instrument settings and characterization of the various species monitored.
In vivo tumor growth studies. To determine the ability of
intratumoral chemotherapy to modulate melanoma tumor
growth, 0.5  106 B16F10 cells, which lack functional PAF-R
(30), were implanted subcutaneously into both shaved hind
ﬂanks of WT and Ptafr/ mice to produce two tumors. Tumor
growth (length and width) was monitored and measured at
various times with digital calipers (Mitituyo), and tumor
volume was calculated (major length  minor length2/2). On
day 6 of tumor implantation and every 3 days afterwards, the
left ﬂank tumor was injected with 100 mL of either etoposide
(36 mg/kg), melphalan (15 mg/kg), or PBS with 0.5% DMSO
vehicle. The working dose of etoposide and melphalan was
achieved by performing dose-dependent pilot studies in WT
mice (n ¼ 3–5). To deﬁne the ability of COX-2 inhibitors to
modulate the effects of chemotherapy, SC-236 (200 ng), NS-398
(5 mg), or 100 mL PBS with 0.5% DMSO vehicle were injected
intraperitoneally at day 0 and every 3 days afterwards.
Human regional chemotherapy studies. Subjects undergoing regional chemotherapy with melphalan for melanoma
were recruited for these studies. During the procedure, 8 mL of
perfusate was removed at various times (after establishment of
the perfusion, once the core limb temperature was 40 C, and
15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following melphalan treatment) from
the circuit and placed into equal volumes of ice-cold methanol
and methylene chloride, and lipids extracted. The human
studies were approved by the Indiana University's and Duke
University's School of Medicine Institutional Review Boards.

Chemotherapy Immunosuppression via PAF Agonists

Statistical analysis
For all murine studies, individual experiments were performed using at least four mice per experimental group and
repeated as necessary (at least once) to verify reproducibility
and provide additional data for analysis. All statistical calculations were performed using SAS Version 9.3. Tumor volume
was calculated as (major  minor2)/2.For the mice studies, the
analysis focused on the end of the study, speciﬁcally on days 14
to 18, where available. The normality of data and equal
variances were checked by the Shapiro–Wilk and the Levene
tests and was a reasonable assumption in all cases. For the
mice data and in vitro data, we used equal or unequal variance t
tests to compare two groups. For comparing more than two
groups, we used ANOVA (with the Welch approximation if the
variances were unequal) and post hoc Tukey-adjusted pairwise
tests. The data represent mean values with SE. Differences were
considered statistically signiﬁcant when the P value was less
than 0.05 and marginally signiﬁcant when the P value was less
than 0.10.

Results
Chemotherapeutic agents generate PAF-R agonists in a
process blocked by antioxidants
The ﬁrst studies were designed to test whether chemotherapeutic agents can induce PAF-R agonists in melanoma cells.
As multiple glycerophosphocholine species can act as PAF-R
agonists, we quantiﬁed total PAF-R biochemical activity as
measured by intracellular calcium mobilization responses in
Fura-2–loaded PAF-R–expressing KBP cells (34) compared
with excess (1 mmol/L) of the metabolically stable PAF-R
agonist carbamoyl-PAF (CPAF) in lipid extracts from murine
B16F10 cells following treatment with the diverse agents
etoposide, cisplatin, or melphalan. Note that the amount of
total PAF-R agonistic activity is deﬁned as the Ca2þ mobilization peak height of the normalized lipid extract as a % of the
peak height from excess CPAF (1 mmol/L) response (17, 18, 34).
Use of this semiquantitative biochemical assay allows all PAFR activity to be measured. As shown in Fig. 1A, lipid extracts
from B16F10 melanoma cells treated with chemotherapeutic
agents induced PAF-R agonistic activity only in PAF-R–
expressing KBP but not in PAF-R–negative KBM cells. Moreover, treatment of KBP but not KBM with these lipid extracts
derived from chemotherapeutic agent-treated B16F10 cells
resulted in the release of IL8 in the supernatants using our
published (18) methodology (data not shown). Time course
studies revealed that chemotherapeutic agents triggered
PAF agonistic activity in murine B16F10 cells that were
similar to human SK23MEL cells (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S1). Murine B16F10 melanoma cells do not express
functional PAF-Rs as measured by lack of Ca2þ response
to CPAF, and lack of PAF-R mRNA by quantitative PCR (35).
To deﬁne whether the presence of the PAF-R (which has
been reported to be expressed on many human melanomas;
ref. 36) can modulate chemotherapy-induced PAF agonistic
activity, we transduced B16F10 cells with the PAF-R gene
construct using MSCV2.1 retrovirus, generating B16F10PAFR (PAF-R-expressing;B16P) and B16F10MSCV2.1 (control

www.aacrjournals.org

PAF-R-negative; B16M) cells (see ref 30 for characterization
of these cell lines). Chemotherapeutic agent treatment
resulted in signiﬁcantly more PAF-R agonistic activity in
the PAF-R–expressing B16P cells (Fig. 1C). Similar to our
previously published ﬁndings examining PAF-R biochemical
activity generated in human epithelial tumor cells or human
skin in response to the pro-oxidative stressor UVB
(20, 24, 37), preincubation of melanoma cells with antioxidants vitamin C or NAC blocked this PAF agonistic activity
(Fig. 1D).
Mass spectrometry-based structural studies using deuterium-labeled internal standards revealed that there were significantly increased levels of not only native PAF, but also Ox-GPC
PAF-R agonists produced nonenzymatically in B16F10 cells in
response to etoposide treatment (Fig. 2). Levels of a large
number of individual Ox-GPC were increased 2- to 3-fold over
baseline, but no consistent changes in lyso-GPC species were
noted (data not shown). The actual amounts, structures and
methods used to measure the Ox-GPCs are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Methods. These studies
indicate that chemotherapeutic agents can trigger the generation of Ox-GPCs with PAF-R activity in murine and human
melanoma cells in vitro.
Intratumoral injection of chemotherapeutic agents
generates PAF-R agonists
Though not commonly used, intratumoral injection of chemotherapeutic agents is a viable treatment for localized disease (38, 39). To deﬁne whether chemotherapeutic agents can
induce the production of PAF-R agonists in vivo, B16F10
tumors were implanted into syngeneic C57BL/6 murine hosts
or human SK23MEL tumors implanted into immunodeﬁcient
SCID mice. When the tumors were approximately 10 mm in
diameter, they were injected with either etoposide or melphalan or PBS vehicle control. Tumors were removed one hour
after injection, weighed, and lipids extracted and PAF-R biochemical activity assayed. Intratumoral injections of chemotherapy agents but not PBS vehicle resulted in the production
of PAF-R agonists in both murine B16F10 and human
SK23MEL tumors (Fig. 3). Of interest, injection of chemotherapeutic agents directly into skin without tumors did not result
in the generation of signiﬁcant levels of PAF-R agonistic
activity (data not shown).
To assess the ability of antioxidants treatment to modulate
chemotherapy-generated PAF-R agonists in vivo, C57BL/6
mice were fed with vitamin C-enriched chow and 5 mmol/L
NAC in water ad libitum for 10 days before tumor implantation
and continued on antioxidant diet until the termination of the
experiment. Tumors were treated with either etoposide, melphalan, or vehicle and PAF-R agonist activity determined from
lipid extracts of 1 hour treated tumors. This antioxidant
regimen, which we have previously demonstrated blocks both
the inhibition of CHS and augmentation of tumor growth
induced by UVB treatment (17, 30) results in the decreased
formation of PAF-R agonists by chemotherapy (Fig. 3A). These
studies indicate that chemotherapeutic agents can generate
PAF-R agonists in vivo, in a process partially blocked by
antioxidants.

PAF-R activation diminishes experimental
chemotherapy effectiveness via Tregs in a COX-2–
dependent process
Given our ﬁndings that intratumoral chemotherapy generates PAF-R agonists in vivo and that systemic PAF-R activation
augments experimental tumor growth via immunosuppression (30), we assessed whether intratumoral chemotherapy
could generate enough PAF-R agonists to modulate tumor
growth. Our protocol was modiﬁed in that WT and PAF-R–
deﬁcient (Ptafr/, PAFR-KO) mice underwent implantation
with B16F10 tumors on both dorsal hindquarters (2 tumors/
mouse). The left ﬂank tumors were treated with intratumoral
chemotherapy or PBS vehicle control starting at day 6 of tumor

cell implantation and repeated every 3 days until the termination of the experiment, whereas the other (right ﬂank)
tumors were left undisturbed. Intratumoral chemotherapy of
one tumor with melphalan (15 mg/kg) or etoposide (36 mg/kg)
resulted in an enhanced growth of the second (undisturbed)
tumor in PAF-R–positive WT compared with Ptafr/ hosts
(Fig. 4A–C). Though intratumoral chemotherapy resulted in
growth inhibition of the chemotherapy-treated left ﬂank
tumors, loss of host PAF-R function exerted no perceptible
effect on the left ﬂank tumor growth characteristics (Supplementary Fig. S2). Subjecting mice to antioxidant treatment had
no effects on the untreated right ﬂank tumor growth by itself,
yet inhibited the melphalan-mediated augmentation of growth

assess whether COX-2 is crucial for PAF-R–mediated augmentation of experimental tumor growth, WT and Ptafr/ mice
were implanted with a single B16F10 tumor and then treated
with COX-2 inhibitors (SC-236 and NS-398) alone or along with
systemic CPAF. COX-2 inhibitors alone did not affect tumor
growth, yet blocked CPAF-mediated augmentation of B16F10
tumor growth in WT mice (Fig. 5A and B) but had no effect on
Ptafr/ hosts (Supplementary Fig. S4). Pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 also blocked the augmentation of tumor
growth associated with chemotherapy (Fig. 5C for melphalan
and Supplementary Fig. S5 for etoposide). These studies indicate that chemotherapy-generated PAF-R agonists augment
experimental tumor growth in a process inhibited by antioxidants and COX-2 inhibitors.
PAF-R–dependent inhibition of CHS reactions is due to an
increase in Tregs (18). Our previous studies have also demonstrated that Tregs are necessary for UVB-mediated augmentation of B16F10 tumor growth (30). The next studies were
designed to deﬁne the role of Tregs in chemotherapy-mediated
augmentation of experimental tumor growth. Use of a Tregdepleting strategy (anti-CD25 antibodies) that we have previously reported blocked UVB-mediated upregulation of tumoral
Tregs (30) inhibited the chemotherapy-mediated augmentation of second tumor growth (Fig. 5D). Using Foxp3EGFP
reporter transgenic mice we measured increased numbers of
Tregs in tumors in response to systemic PAF-R activation that
was blocked by COX-2 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6).
These studies demonstrate that systemic PAF-R–mediated
augmentation of tumor growth is dependent upon Tregs and
suggest that COX-2 is necessary for their formation.

etoposide-mediated augmentation of right ﬂank tumor growth
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Importantly, antioxidant diet had no
effect on the growth of right ﬂank tumors in chemotherapytreated PAF-R–deﬁcient hosts (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Of note, we did not detect differences in the growth of
the chemotherapy-treated left ﬂank tumors when WT or
Ptafr/ mice were placed on an antioxidant diet. Overall,
these ﬁndings ﬁt with the concept that chemotherapeutic
agents generate Ox-GPCs via ROS, which then inhibit tumor
immunity, resulting in an augmentation of tumor growth in a
PAF-R–dependent manner.

30 to 60 minutes in the heated (40 C) limb (39). Minimal
amounts of PAF-R agonists were found in the circulating
perfusate before addition of the melphalan (Fig. 6A). However,
once the melphalan chemotherapy began perfusing in the
heated limb, signiﬁcant amounts of PAF-R agonistic activity

were measured in the perfusates, with the highest amounts
found at the conclusion of regional chemotherapy treatment.
Structural characterization of perfusates using mass spectrometry identiﬁed PAF and several Ox-GPC species
(Fig. 6B). These studies indicate that chemotherapy exposure
generates systemic PAF-R agonists in humans.

Discussion
Chemotherapy is the most commonly used medical treatment for cancer. The present study describes a previously
unappreciated mechanism by which chemotherapy exposure
results in the production of PAF-R agonists, which are known
to inhibit tumor immunity (30). These data support the model
that Ox-GPC PAF-R agonists produced in part due to ROS from
chemotherapeutic agents can exert systemic immunosuppressive effects. That chemotherapeutic agent-triggered PAF-R
agonist formation and augmentation of tumor growth are
partially inhibited by antioxidants suggests that antioxidants
could have potential use in chemotherapy protocols. Of interest, systemic antioxidants have been championed for adjuvant
use along with chemotherapy to decrease therapy side effects
(40, 41). Yet, use of antioxidants along with chemotherapy is
considered controversial due to concerns about possible interference with chemotherapeutic agent-mediated direct killing
of tumor cells (42, 43). It should be noted that the present
studies indicate that antioxidant treatment alone or in

www.aacrjournals.org

chemotherapy-treated PAF-R–deﬁcient mice did not have any
perceptible effects on tumor growth.
Oxidation of esteriﬁed fatty acyl residues introduces oxy
functions, rearranges bonds and fragments carbon-carbon
bonds by b-scission that generate a myriad of phospholipid
reaction products including PAF-R agonists (19–25). In contrast to the tightly controlled enzymatic pathways for PAF
biosynthesis, large amounts of numerous Ox-GPC PAF-R agonists can be produced nonenzymatically. The present studies
not only demonstrate that chemotherapy-generated PAF-R
agonistic activity is diminished by antioxidants, but structural
characterization of this activity reveals Ox-GPCs known to be
produced nonenzymatically. Consistent with the notion that
chemotherapy is a potent pro-oxidative stressor, intratumoral
injection of melphalan resulted in increased urine levels of
immunoreactive 8-isoprostane (8-iso Prostaglandin F2a), an
eicosanoid formed from free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of
arachidonate, which was blunted in mice fed antioxidant diet
(data not shown). It is likely that tumor cellular membranes

A, lipid extracts were obtained from 8 mL of perfusate drawn at various
times [once the circuit was placed (Control), once the limb was at 40 C

during isolated limb chemoperfusion and tested for PAF-R activity as

serve as the source of oxidized phospholipids from the chemotherapeutic agent intratumoral injections and are thus the
source of chemotherapy-mediated PAF-R agonist formation in
the experimental murine models used. However, it is not clear
whether the source of PAF-R agonists produced during human
regional chemotherapy is derived from the tumors or from
normal tissue.
The present study demonstrates that high levels of PAF-R
agonist activity are measured during regional chemotherapy.
In contrast with the poor responsiveness of metastatic melanoma to standard chemotherapy, regional chemotherapy
appears to be one of the most successful antimelanoma
therapies as measured by percentage of clinical responders
(4–6). Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion, ﬁrst reported in
1958, allows the regional delivery of chemotherapeutic agents
(commonly melphalan) to patients with intransit metastases
localized to extremities that would not be approachable by
surgical resection. The ability to use 10-fold higher than the

7076

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

standard chemotherapy doses along with heat provides a very
potent combination to kill tumor cells. Another advantage of
regional chemotherapy is the ability to treat the entire area at
highest risk of reoccurrence by eliminating clinically occult
microscopic tumor disease with minimal risk of systemic
toxicity. We hypothesize that this combination of heat and
high-dose melphalan also allows a rather unique environment
that promotes ROS. Though it is possible that standard doses of
systemic chemotherapy could generate immunosuppressive
Ox-GPC PAF-R agonists that impede therapy effectiveness, this
novel and previously unappreciated pathway would more
likely play an important role in regional chemotherapy.
Tumoral resistance to chemotherapy is an important clinical problem and is an area of active study. In contrast to
cellular resistance to the effects of chemotherapy, the present
studies describe a novel mechanism by which chemotherapeutic agents can subvert antitumor immunity. Indeed, our
previous studies using UVB irradiation of skin as the source for
PAF-R agonists provide several lines of evidence implicating
antitumor immunity, in particular Tregs in the PAF-mediated
effects on experimental B16F10 tumor growth (30). First, PAF
effects are not seen when tumors are placed in immunodeﬁcient murine hosts. Second, use of PAF-R–negative B16F10
cells transduced with functional PAF-Rs implanted in WT
versus Ptafr/ hosts have conﬁrmed that the PAF-R mediating the response is on the host, not tumor. Finally, use of
neutralizing antibodies against IL10 or depleting Tregs both
block PAF-mediated augmentation of experimental tumor
growth. It is possible that this previously unappreciated pathway could provide an explanation for why immunotherapy
strategies tend to be more effective when given to patients who
have not received prior chemotherapy, which according to our
model could potentially tolerize the immune system to the
tumors (44–46).
Exogenous pro-oxidative stressors ranging from aromatic
hydrocarbons to cigarette smoke to UVB radiation have been
shown to induce systemic immunosuppression via PAF-R
signaling, which is blocked by antioxidants (16–18). Apoptotic
cells generate PAF and also contribute to melanoma tumor
progression via PAF-R activation (47). The production of PAFR agonists from these various agents begins a cascade of events
leading to systemic immunosuppression. The cytokines that
appear to be critical for the immunosuppression include IL10
and COX-2–generated eicosanoids (14, 15, 18). Mast cells and
regulatory T cells are also implicated in PAF-R–dependent
systemic immunosuppression (18, 30, 48). The present studies
demonstrating that COX-2 inhibitors block chemotherapymediated augmentation of experimental tumor growth are
not only consistent with previous studies characterizing the
role of this eicosanoid-generating enzyme in PAF-mediated
systemic immunosuppression (14, 15, 18), they also provide the
rationale for future studies testing the ability of COX-2 inhibitors to enhance the effectiveness of regional chemotherapy.
It should be noted that COX-2 inhibition has been shown to
exert not only protective properties on the host, but also direct
antitumor effects in a variety of tumor types (49, 50). In
contrast, antioxidant use along with chemotherapy is associated with controversy due to possible concerns that these

agents could interfere with the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy (42,
43).
In summary, the present studies provide the ﬁrst evidence
that PAF-R signaling can inhibit chemotherapy effectiveness.
In contrast to chemotherapy resistance that is applicable at the
tumor cell level, this process is due to the subversion of host
tumor immunity. That chemotherapy generates PAF-R agonists in humans is suggestive that this novel pathway could
have tremendous clinical signiﬁcance. As this process involves
the pro-oxidative qualities of chemotherapeutic agents and is
neutralized by antioxidants, with downstream effects susceptible to COX-2 inhibition, these studies could provide the
impetus for future studies to deﬁne the clinical signiﬁcance
of this novel pathway in humans.
