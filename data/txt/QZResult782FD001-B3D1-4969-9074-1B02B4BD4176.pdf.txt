Abstract
S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) represents the bestdocumented denitrosylase implicated in regulating the levels of
proteins posttranslationally modiﬁed by nitric oxide on cysteine
residues by S-nitrosylation. GSNOR controls a diverse array of
physiologic functions, including cellular growth and differentiation, inﬂammation, and metabolism. Chromosomal deletion of
GSNOR results in pathologic protein S-nitrosylation that is
implicated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we
identify a metabolic hallmark of aberrant S-nitrosylation in HCC
and exploit it for therapeutic gain. We ﬁnd that hepatocyte
GSNOR deﬁciency is characterized by mitochondrial alteration

and by marked increases in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)
levels and activity. We ﬁnd that this depends on the selective
S-nitrosylation of Cys501 in the mitochondrial chaperone
TRAP1, which mediates its degradation. As a result, GSNORdeﬁcient cells and tumors are highly sensitive to SDH inhibition, namely to a-tocopheryl succinate, an SDH-targeting molecule that induced RIP1/PARP1-mediated necroptosis and
inhibited tumor growth. Our work provides a speciﬁc molecular signature of aberrant S-nitrosylation in HCC, a novel
molecular target in SDH, and a ﬁrst-in-class therapy to treat
the disease. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4170–82. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

Note: Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research
Online (http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/).

GSNOR-KO mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
association with S-nitrosylation and proteasomal degradation of
the DNA repair enzyme O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase
(AGT; ref. 6). Studies performed on human patients with HCC
showed a signiﬁcant decrease of GSNOR protein levels and
activity (7), arguing for a functional link between GSNOR-dependent S-nitrosylation and HCC existing also in humans.
We recently observed that skeletal muscle of GSNOR-KO mice
show altered mitochondrial network (8), suggesting that excessive
S-nitrosylation affects mitochondrial homeostasis. This is in line
with the evidence arguing for mitochondria representing a preferential target of NO (9), and respiratory chain being susceptible
to S-nitrosylation (10).
Here, we demonstrate that GSNOR deﬁciency induces mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, SDH) upregulation due to S-nitrosylation and subsequent degradation of the
TNF receptor–associated protein 1 (TRAP1). TRAP1 is a mitochondrial chaperone: (i) suppressing mitochondrial ROS production (11, 12); (ii) inhibiting permeability transition pore opening;
(iii) preserving mitochondrial bioenergetics (11, 13); and (iv)
acting as SDH activity inhibitor (14, 15). We provide evidence that
TRAP1 degradation by S-nitrosylation upregulates SDH and sensitizes GSNOR-deﬁcient HCC cells to SDH inhibitors, paving the
way for the development of novel chemotherapeutic approaches.

Materials and Methods

S-nitrosylation is a cysteine posttranslational modiﬁcation
emerging as the main modiﬁcation underlying nitric oxide
(NO) bioactivity (1). The extent of S-nitrosocysteines (SNO)
depends on: (i) NO production by NO synthase (NOS); (ii)
how NO is conveyed by S-nitrosylase complexes on target
proteins (2); (iii) SNO removal by denitrosylases, among
which S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) is the bestcharacterized example (3, 4). GSNOR catalyzes S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reduction, thus indirectly controlling cellular
levels of protein SNOs (PSNO; refs. 3, 5).

TRAP1 and SDH as Therapeutic Targets of HCC

lines were passaged for fewer than 2 months after resuscitation
and were used from the third to the ﬁfteenth passage in culture.
Cell line validation was carried out by the manufacturer by
means of DNA Proﬁle STR (short tandem repeat). Cell lines
were routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination by a
PCR-based assay. Primary hepatocytes were obtained from
GSNOR-KO and WT mice as described previously (16) and
cultured in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (MEGM).
Compounds and relative concentrations used in this study
are as follows: 40 or 60 mmol/L a-TOS, 20 mmol/L 3BrPA, 5
mmol/L NAC, 200 mmol/L TROLOX, 100 mmol/L DHQ, 1 mmol/L
3AP, 1 mmol/L DTT, 50 mmol/L CHX, 500 mmol/L L-NAME
(Sigma). 5 mmol/L DHE, 5 mmol/L H2DCFDA and 20 mmol/L
DAF-FM-DA (Life Technologies); 10 mmol/L MG132 (Merck
Millipore); 0.5 mmol/L epoxomicin and 10 mmol/L necrostatin1 (NEC-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 20 mmol/L z-VAD (MP
Biomedicals). Cells transfections, Western blot analysis, and qRTPCR analysis are described in Supplementary Materials.
Analysis of cell viability, survival, and apoptosis
Dead cells were evaluated by direct cell count upon Trypan blue
staining or by ﬂuorescence microscopy upon staining with LIVE/
DEAD Cell Imaging Kit (488/570; Life Technologies). Cell viability was determined following ﬂuorescence emission at 590 nm
after 4-hour incubation with AlamarBlue Reagent (Life Technologies). Apoptotic cells were evaluated upon staining with 50
mmol/L propidium iodide (Sigma) by a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences; ref. 17). Apoptotic cells refer to the
hypodiploid nuclei (sub-G1) population. Clonogenic survival
assay was performed as described previously (18). Electron and
immunoﬂuorescence microscopy analyses are described in Supplementary Materials.
ROS and nitric oxide evaluation
Thirty minutes before the end of treatment with SDH inhibitors
(6 hours), cells were incubated with DHE or H2DCFDA at 37 C
for the detection of superoxide or H2O2, respectively. Endogenous
nitric oxide production was assessed in cells 24 hours after plating
by 30-minute incubation with DAF-FM-DA. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed cytoﬂuorometrically.

ments were performed on an EASY-nLC system (Proxeon Biosystems) connected to the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion
source (Proxeon Biosystems). The Q-Exactive was operated in
data-dependent mode with the MS survey scan ranging from
300 to 1,750 m/z and a resolution of 70,000. The 12 most
abundant ions with charge  2þ from each survey scan were
sequentially isolated (isolation window of 2 m/z) and subjected to MS/MS fragmentation by high-energy collisional
dissociation (HCD; ref. 23). Raw data were processed with
MaxQuant software suite version 1.3.0.5 searching peak lists
agains UniProt human database. Methylthiolation and HPDPBiotinylation were manually conﬁgured as variable peptide
modiﬁcations. Maximum false discovery rates were set to
0.01 for proteins, peptides, and modiﬁcation sites.
Animal experimentation
Mouse experiments were conducted at the mouse facility of the
Danish Cancer Society Research Center with the approval of the
Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in Denmark.
GSNOR-KO mice were generated in J.S. Stamler's laboratory on
C57BL/6J background (4). Livers were collected from 2-monthold mice and used for Western blot analyses or processed to
evaluate mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Xenograft experiments were conducted on NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (SCID)
mice strains. Tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection,
into the right lower ﬂank, of 5  106 HepG2 cells stably downregulating GSNOR (n ¼ 16) or scrambled counterparts (n ¼ 16).
When palpable tumors were recognized, each group was split into
a-TOS–treated (n ¼ 10) and vehicle-treated (n ¼ 6) groups. a-TOS
was dissolved in Corn oil/4% ethanol as reported previously (24)
and used at 5 mmol (2 injections/week). Treatments started when
tumor diameter reached 5 mm, and tumor size was measured
twice per week for 2 weeks.
ATP measurement
ATP levels were measured by the ATP Bioluminescence
Assay Kit CLS II (Roche) using a microplate luminometer
(PerkinElmer).

Enzymatic activities
Succinate:coenzyme Q oxidoreductase activity was assayed
spectrophotometrically in puriﬁed mitochondria after the
reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, DCPIP (Sigma)
as reported previously (19). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
activity was measured in cell media after the oxidation of
NADH (Roche). GSNOR activity was assayed as described by
Jensen and colleagues (5).

Analyses of mitochondrial mass and transmembrane
potential (Dcm)
Total mitochondrial mass and Dym were analyzed cytoﬂuorometrically by incubating the cells with 50 nmol/L MitoTracker
Green-FM and 200 nmol/L MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Life Technologies), respectively. Alternatively, Dym was evaluated by ﬂuorescence microscopy upon JC-1 staining (Life Technologies;
ref. 8).

Detection of PSNOs and TRAP1 S-nitrosylation
PSNOs were evaluated by biotin switch assay as described
previously (8, 20). To identify TRAP1 S-nitrosylated sites,
human recombinant TRAP1 (ADI-SPP-848; Enzo Life Sciences)
was incubated with 2 mmol/L DTT for 1 hour, washed with
PBS, and then maintained for 2 hours with 5 mmol/L DPTANONOate (Sigma). As control, equal amount of protein was
left in DTT. Proteins were then subjected to biotin switch assay
and digested with endopeptidase LysC (Wako) followed by
trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega; ref. 21). Resulted peptides
were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS as in ref. 22 and measure-

Cell fractionation and oxygen consumption
Mitochondria were isolated and oxygen consumption determined as described previously (25) in intact mitochondria, or in
mitochondrial membranes obtained upon osmotic lysis in water
as previously reported (26). P:O ratio calculated in intact mitochondria of WT and GSNOR-KO livers was 2.34  0.13 versus
2.09  0.13, respectively.

Results
GSNOR downregulation results in mitochondrial defects
GSNOR-KO mice spontaneously develop HCC (7) and show
mitochondrial fragmentation in skeletal muscle (8). On the
basis of this, we investigated whether mitochondria of liver
obtained from 2-month-old GSNOR-KO mice (which did
show no sign of HCC hitherto) exhibited defects in mitochondrial respiration and function. Respiration, measured upon
malate/glutamate addition (involving complex I), was significantly dampened in GSNOR-KO mitochondria, whereas res-

piration measured upon succinate addition (starting from
complex II) was about 40% higher than the WT counterparts,
notwithstanding complex IV efﬁciency was decreased (Fig. 1A,
left). To untie complex I and II activities from complex IV
oxygen consumption, we repeated the analyses in mitochondrial membranes obtained upon osmotic lysis. Figure 1A
(right) shows no difference of complex I activity between the
two genotypes. In contrast, complex II activity was even more
increased in GSNOR-KO samples, suggesting that this effect
was masked in intact mitochondria due to the downstream
inhibition of complex IV. These results were strengthened by
Western blot analysis of complex IV (subunit I), which were
reduced in GSNOR-KO liver extracts, and complex II (as
revealed by its subunit A) that, conversely, signiﬁcantly
increased (Fig. 1B).
To investigate the effects of GSNOR deﬁciency in the context of
HCC, we silenced GSNOR in the human HCC cell line HepG2

TRAP1 and SDH as Therapeutic Targets of HCC

(siGSNOR HepG2) with two different pools of siRNAs (Fig. 1C
and D), inducing 2-fold increase in PSNOs content (Fig. 1E).
However, they did not affect NOS isoform expression pattern
(with nNOS being undetectable, see Fig. 1C), or alter NO production (Fig. 1F), indicating that changes in S-nitrosylation were
independent on NO synthesis.
In line with results obtained in liver extracts, SDHA levels
and Complex II activity were upregulated in GSNOR-silenced
cells (Fig. 1G and H). However, mitochondrial proteins and
mass (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) and gene expression
of all four SDH subunits (Supplementary Fig. S1C) did not
change, indicating that SDH upregulation was not due to any
transcriptional regulation or change in the number of mitochondria. We also observed that ATP levels tend to decrease
(Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E), whereas Dym signiﬁcantly
dropped with respect to siScr cells (Supplementary Fig. S1F
and S1G).
GSNOR downregulation modulates SDH by affecting TRAP1
stability via S-nitrosylation at Cys501
To unveil whether SDH upregulation upon GSNOR depletion was related to S-nitrosylation, we focused on the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which has recently been found to
affect SDH activity (14). Western blot analysis revealed that
TRAP1 protein levels were reduced in GSNOR-depleted cells
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S3), despite no change in mRNA
was detected (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We then hypothesized
that TRAP1 could be destabilized and undergo degradation
owing to S-nitrosylation, with this assumption strengthening
by the evidence that: (i) incubations with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 completely restored TRAP1 levels in siGSNOR cells (Fig. 2B) and (ii) pretreatment with the NOS inhibitor Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) prevented
TRAP1 decrease and SDHA upregulation (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). We then evaluated TRAP1 protein levels by Western blot
analysis on a pool of PSNOs obtained by biotin switch assays.
Results shown in Fig. 2C indicate that S-nitrosylated TRAP1
accumulated upon proteasome inhibition only in siGSNOR
cells, arguing for S-nitrosylation being associated with TRAP1selective degradation. Consistently, siGSNOR or siTRAP1
HepG2 cells showed the same expression pattern as SDHA and
TRAP1, with the former upregulated and the latter decreased
(Fig. 2D). Moreover, TRAP1 overexpression was able to downregulate SDH (Fig. 2E) and to accelerate its turnover in the
presence of the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide
(Fig. 2F).
The possibility that TRAP1 could be degraded via the proteasome has been suggested (28). However, mitochondrial proteins
are usually targets of specialized mitochondrial proteases (29).
Therefore, to clarify whether S-nitrosylation–induced degradation of TRAP1 was mediated by the proteasome, we puriﬁed
cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of HepG2 cells and mouse
livers, conﬁrming that TRAP1 signiﬁcantly decreased only in
mitochondria of GSNOR-deﬁcient systems (Fig. 2G and H).
Moreover, incubation with MG132 showed that TRAP1 accumulated exclusively in the cytosol of siGSNOR cells (Fig. 2G), where
the levels of ubiquitylated TRAP1 increased even in the absence of
MG132 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The evidence that the highly
selective proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin produced the same
effects of MG132 (Fig. 2I) reinforced the hypothesis that TRAP1
degradation occurred via the proteasome. In agreement, incuba-

tions with cycloheximide resulted in a more rapid turnover of
TRAP1 in siGSNOR cells (Fig. 2J).
To identify the cysteine residue(s) being modiﬁed by NO, we
treated recombinant human TRAP1 with DETA-NONOate and
performed a biotin switch assay, followed by analysis with high
accuracy mass spectrometry (Fig. 2K). The mass spectrometric
measurements unambiguously identiﬁed TRAP1 peptide bearing
biotinylation at Cys501 residue, implementing Cys501 as S-nitrosylation site (Fig. 2L), and conﬁrming previous high-throughput
proteomic studies (30). On the basis of these results, we generated
a human TRAP1-C501S mutant and induced its expression in
siGSNOR cells. Western blots, obtained upon incubation with
cycloheximide, indicate that TRAP1-C501S was more stable (Fig.
2M), conﬁrming that S-nitrosylation of Cys501 prepares the way
for TRAP1 degradation.
To understand whether Cys-to-Ser substitution was still able to
maintain TRAP1 functional relationship with SDH, we overexpressed TRAP1-C501S mutant in parental HepG2. Under these
conditions, SDH protein levels were reduced (Fig. 2N) and its
turnover accordingly decreased (Fig. 2O). In agreement, TRAP1C501S was able to revert the increase of Complex II activity
observed in siGSNOR cells (Fig. 2P).
GSNOR downregulation sensitizes HepG2 cells to oxidative
stress and cytotoxicity induced by SDH-targeting mitocans
We attempted to exploit the unusual TRAP1 decrease and
take advantage by SDH upregulation to selectively target HCC
cells. We analyzed the occurrence of cell death upon treatment
with two different SDH inhibitors listed as mitocans, namely:
3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), which alkylates SDH sulfhydryl
groups (31), and a-tocopheryl succinate (a-TOS), which speciﬁcally binds to ubiquinone binding site of SDH (32). As
negative control, we used malonate, the physiologic SDH
inhibitor, at a concentration of 20 mmol/L to abolish Complex
II activity. Direct cell counts showed that siGSNOR cells were
insensitive to malonate, but more susceptible to treatments
with a-TOS and 3-BrPA used at concentrations in a range that
provides a similar extent of cell death (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Further cell viability and clonogenic survival assays
performed with a-TOS produced similar results, conﬁrming
that GSNOR downregulation sensitized HepG2 cells to a-TOS
treatment (Fig. 3A and B).
Oxidative stress is one of the main effects induced by mitocans, thus contributing to their antitumor activity (24, 33).
Therefore, we measured superoxide and H2O2 levels and found
that both increased signiﬁcantly when GSNOR was downregulated (Fig. 4C and D). Interestingly, when we preincubated the
cells with the ROS scavenger TROLOX, as well as when we
ectopically overexpressed either mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) or catalase fused with a mitochondrial import
sequence (mitoCAT; Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D), ROS
production was inhibited and protein oxidative damage was
prevented (Fig. 3C–E). This was associated with a complete
recovery of cell viability (Fig. 3F and G and Supplementary Fig.
S3B). We then transfected HepG2 cells with siRNA against
GSNOR in combination with siRNAs against each SDH subunit
(SDH A–D). In these conditions, superoxide production was
prevented and a-TOS cytotoxicity was completely abolished
(Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F), conﬁrming the selectivity of
a-TOS towards mitochondrial complex II. Moreover, TRAP1C501S rendered siGSNOR cells insensitive to a-TOS toxicity

TRAP1 and SDH as Therapeutic Targets of HCC

(Fig. 3H and I) and abolished superoxide production (Supplementary Fig. S3G), implying that TRAP1 S-nitrosylation is
required for a-TOS toxicity. In agreement, TRAP1 silencing
enhanced a-TOS vulnerability of parental HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3H).
SDH inhibitors induce PARP1/RIP1-dependent necroptosis in
GSNOR downregulating HepG2 cells
By looking at the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell
death process observed, we analyzed the possible occurrence of
apoptosis. Western blot analyses indicated that cleavage of
caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as proteolysis of PARP1, were
not induced in a-TOS–treated siGSNOR cells (Fig. 4A). No
increase of apoptotic cells was observed (Supplementary
Fig. S4A), and no rescue of cell viability was achieved upon
the inhibition of caspases (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Subcellular localization analyses of the apoptosis inducing factor 1
(AIF1) also excluded a caspase-independent apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Conversely, we observed an increase of
LDH release in the extracellular medium (Fig. 4B), suggesting
that treatment with a-TOS reasonably induced necrosis in
siGSNOR cells.
Several ﬁndings have reported that caspases undergo S-nitrosylation and inactivation (34–36). Consistently, we observed
that caspase-3 underwent massive S-nitrosylation in siGSNOR
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D), suggesting that apoptosis,
even though induced, could be inhibited by excessive S-nitrosylation. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we preincubated the
cells with the thiol-reducing agent dithiotreitol (DTT) and
treated them with higher concentration of a-TOS to also
induce a signiﬁcant extent of cell death in siScr cells. DTT
signiﬁcantly switched cell death response in siGSNOR cells
from full necrosis to apoptosis at the same extent measured
in siScr cells (Supplementary Fig. S4E), thus arguing for the
denitrosylating effect of DTT being entirely compensatory of
GSNOR deﬁciency. In agreement, PARP1 was cleaved, signaling the effective accomplishment of the apoptotic program
(Supplementary Fig. S4F).
In the search for the molecular determinants of mitocaninduced necrosis, we pondered the evidence that full-length
PARP1 seemed actually to be induced upon a-TOS treatment
(see Fig. 4A). Consistently, polyADP-ribosylated (pADPr) protein levels also increased in siGSNOR cells, even in the absence
of a-TOS (Supplementary Fig. S4G). Long-lasting PARP1
hyperactivation results in necrosis (37). Therefore, we investigated whether PARP1 could have a role in a-TOS–induced cell
death. Figure 4C and D indicate that the extent of dead cells

signiﬁcantly decreased by inhibiting PARP1 activity either
genetically (siRNA against PARP1), or pharmacologically (pretreatments with PARP1 inhibitors).
We then veriﬁed whether PARP1 triggered programmed
necrosis by the activation of the receptor-activating protein 1
(RIP1; ref. 38). Particularly, we observed that RIP1 was induced
in siGSNOR cells treated with a-TOS (Fig. 4E) and that preincubation with the RIP1 inhibitor NEC-1 reverted cell death
(Fig. 4F). Moreover, PARP1 inhibition reduced RIP1 levels
(Fig. 4G), conﬁrming the crucial role of PARP1/RIP1 signaling
axis in transducing death signals under nitrosative stress.
Indeed, both NEC-1 and DTT restored clonogenic survival of
siGSNOR cells treated with a-TOS (Fig. 4H). To widen the
biologic signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings, we also performed experiments with 3-BrPa obtaining similar results (Supplementary
Fig. S4H).
To ﬁnally conﬁrm the occurrence of necroptosis, we analyzed
the cell ultrastructure through electron microscopy (39). siGSNOR cells exposed to a-TOS generally display mitochondrial
swelling and damage, whose severity increased in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4I). Particularly, upon treatment with
40 mmol/L a-TOS, the normal structure of inner mitochondrial
cristae appeared almost completely lost. Nuclei were still intact
but swollen and cytoplasmic volume was substantially reduced.
Conversely, in siScr cells, a-TOS induced changes in subcellular
structures only at the highest concentrations used (60 mmol/L),
with many of them resembling the canonical features of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4I).
GSNOR downregulation selectively sensitizes HCC cells to
a-TOS in an SDH-dependent manner
We next tested a-TOS effects on cell viability of other two
different HCC cell lines, HuH7 and Hepa1-6, along with primary murine hepatocytes (Fig. 5A). a-TOS did not affect cell
viability of hepatocytes as previously reported (40), but induced
only a mild cytostatic effect above 80 mmol/L, with this being
independent on GSNOR expression (Fig. 5B and C). In contrast,
a-TOS induced cell death in HCC cells, although to different
extents. In particular, Hepa1-6 were less susceptible, displaying
an EC50 ¼ 175.04 mmol/L versus 74.07 and 60.06 mmol/L of
HuH7 and HepG2, respectively. Furthermore, GSNOR downregulation did not enhance a-TOS toxicity in Hepa1-6 cells
(Fig. 5D). Going into depth on this different response, we found
that Hepa1-6 cells displayed a halved mitochondrial content
and 8-fold decrease of SDH activity (Supplementary Fig. S5A
and Fig. 5E), conﬁrming the role of mitochondria as elective
target for HCC selective killing. On the other hand, GSNOR-

TRAP1 and SDH as Therapeutic Targets of HCC

downregulating HuH7 cells recapitulated what previously
observed in HepG2. In particular, GSNOR deﬁciency resulted
in TRAP1 downregulation and SDH increase (Fig. 5F), condition enhancing a-TOS toxicity (Fig. 5G and H). Cell death was
reverted by preincubation with DTT and NEC-1, as well as by
overexpressing TRAP1-C501S mutant (Fig. 5I). Similarly, a-TOS
induced cell death by means of massive superoxide and H2O2
production that were dampened upon preincubation with
TROLOX or by overexpression of SOD2 and mitoCAT (Fig.
5K and L and Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C).
a-TOS induces tumor regression in GSNOR-downregulating
HepG2 tumor xenografts
We next moved to HepG2 xenografts implanted in SCID mice,
and evaluated a-TOS antitumor efﬁcacy. We generated HepG2
cell lines stably expressing shRNAs against GSNOR (shGSNOR)
(Fig. 6A). Then, we selected two clones showing TRAP1 downregulation, SDHA increase (Fig. 6B), and sensitivity to a-TOS
cytotoxicity (Fig. 6C) to exclude any cellular compensatory mechanism(s) emerging during clonal selection. We injected subcutaneously shGSNOR or control shSrc HepG2 cells and once tumor
masses reached 5 mm diameter, we treated the mice for 2 weeks by
intraperitoneal administrations of a-TOS, provided at low doses
(5 mmol each three days). Results shown in Fig. 6D and E indicate
that volumes, as well as ﬁnal weights and size, were signiﬁcantly
reduced in shGSNOR HCC xenografts with respect to the vehicletreated counterparts, whereas no signiﬁcant difference was
observed in shScr xenografts. shGSNOR xenografts treated with
a-TOS showed increased protein carbonylation (Fig. 6F), and
induction of RIP1 expression (Fig. 6G), conﬁrming that a-TOS
susceptibility was due to necroptosis-like cell death induced by
oxidative stress.

Discussion
Conﬂicting lines of evidence argue that NO can carry out antior protumor activities, as well as having a still not clariﬁed role
in tumorigenesis. HCC is a case in point, as iNOS is often increased in pathologies predisposing to HCC (41) but iNOS/
mice revealed only very little effects of NO in hepatocarcinogenesis (42). In reconciling these apparently contradictory
results, several pieces of evidence about the establishment of
excessive S-nitrosylation in HCC due to GSNOR downregulation are accumulating (6). Moreover, human GSNOR gene is
located at approximately 4q23, a region frequently subjected to
chromosomal deletion in HCC (43–45) and GSNOR downregulation has been found associated with de novo hepatocarcinogenesis after tumor resection and a poor prognosis in
patients with HCC (46). Finally, meta-analyses present in the
Oncomine platform (Supplementary Fig. S6A) and quantitative

evaluation of human HCC samples obtained by The Human
Protein Atlas collection by IHC proﬁler (Supplementary
Fig. S6B; ref. 47) show a direct correlation between GSNOR
underexpression and HCC.
Here, we have characterized that GSNOR downregulation
induces a rearrangement of the mitochondrial electron transfer
chain. Although the downregulation of complex IV was already
reported as being negatively affected by S-nitrosylation, and,
for this reason, expected to occur in conditions of GSNOR
deﬁciency, the evidence that SDH is upregulated is new and
noteworthy, and may constitute a mechanism of cell adaptation. In support of this hypothesis, it should be noticed that,
notwithstanding the fact that GSNOR-downregulating cells
show a decreased Dy, ATP levels are relatively preserved,
indicating that a metabolic reprogramming is nevertheless
activated to sustain cell energetic needs.
From a mechanistic point of view, we have demonstrated
that TRAP1 S-nitrosylation at Cys501 is the causative event
underlying the increase of SDH levels and activity. TRAP1 is
essential for mitochondrial protein quality control (48, 49). As
it preferentially accumulates in the matrix (50), it is plausible
that TRAP1 could interact with SDH, mainly with subunits A
and B that are exposed to this mitochondrial compartment,
and, in turn, regulate SDH turnover. This hypothesis would
support our data, and would also partly agree with recent
results highlighting a negative correlation between TRAP1 and
SDH activity (14). However, the role of TRAP1 downregulation
that we have here outlined as responsible for HCC sensitivity to
mitochondrial drugs, to the best of our knowledge does not
represent a condition concurring to HCC onset. This would be
inconsistent with the current literature that, in contrast, indicates that TRAP1 is upregulated in several cancers (51, 52). We
do not currently know the kinetics of TRAP1 modulation
during the complex process of hepatocarcinogenesis. We only
indicate that at least in the GSNOR-downregulating subtype
of HCC, TRAP1 is target of S-nitrosylation and subjected to
accelerated degradation. This condition, resulting in SDH upregulation, makes it possible to envision that SDH inhibitors
might selectively target this HCC subtype.
It is worthwhile noting that excessive S-nitrosylation, because
of GSNOR deﬁciency, also has an effect on the modality of cell
death induced by SDH inhibitors, with the RIP1-mediated
necroptosis activated in place of apoptosis. This depends both
on the high levels of ROS produced and on the incapability of
GSNOR-downregulating HCC cells to correctly activate caspase-3,
as caspases undergo S-nitrosylation on catalytic cysteine and
inactivation of their proteolytic activity (34, 35). The incapability
to correctly activate apoptosis could be, in principle, another
factor that contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis in conditions of
GSNOR deﬁciency.

TRAP1 and SDH as Therapeutic Targets of HCC

Altogether, if on the one hand, our results provide the molecular basis for designing highly selective SDH-targeting drugs
aimed at improving chemotherapy against HCC, on the one other
they also set the stage for comprehending a redox-based regulation of TRAP1 stability.
