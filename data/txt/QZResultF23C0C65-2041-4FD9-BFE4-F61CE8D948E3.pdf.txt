Abstract
There is no tailored therapy yet for human basal-like mammary carcinomas. However, BRCA1 dysfunction is
frequently present in these malignancies, compromising homology-directed DNA repair. This defect may serve
as the tumor's Achilles heel and make the tumor hypersensitive to DNA breaks. We have evaluated this putative synthetic lethality in a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA1-associated breast cancer, using
the topoisomerase I (Top1) poison topotecan as monotherapy and in combination with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition by olaparib. All 20 tumors tested were topotecan sensitive, but response heterogeneity was
substantial. Although topotecan increased mouse survival, all tumors eventually acquired resistance. As mechanisms of in vivo resistance, we identified overexpression of Abcg2/Bcrp and markedly reduced protein levels
of the drug target Top1 (without altered mRNA levels). Tumor-specific genetic ablation of Abcg2 significantly
increased overall survival of topotecan-treated animals (P < 0.001), confirming the in vivo relevance of ABCG2
for topotecan resistance in a novel approach. Despite the lack of ABCG2, a putative tumor-initiating cell marker, none of the 11 Abcg2−/−;Brca1−/−;p53−/− tumors were eradicated, not even by the combination topotecanolaparib. We find that olaparib substantially increases topotecan toxicity in this model, and we suggest that
this might also happen in humans. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1700–10. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Topotecan is used to treat ovarian, cervical, and small cell
lung cancer patients. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase I
(Top1)–mediated religation of ssDNA breaks (SSB). When
drug-stabilized covalent Top1-DNA complexes cause stalling
of the replication machinery, SSBs are converted into doublestranded DNA breaks (DSB). Such replication-mediated DSBs
seem to be the primary cytotoxic mechanism of Top1 inhibitors in dividing cells (1). Cell lines defective in proper DSB
repair pathways show an increased sensitivity to Top1 poisons (reviewed in ref. 1). An example is a defect in BRCA1

(2), which is required for error-free repair of DSB by homologous recombination (HR). HR is frequently impaired in basal-like breast cancer, and BRCA1 dysfunction is one of the
causes of this defect (3–5). About 15% of clinical patients
are diagnosed with basal-like breast cancer, which is usually
negative for ERBB2 and hormone receptors (“triple negative”;
refs. 6, 7). Patients with this disease face a poor prognosis, as
there is no targeted therapy available (6, 7). Topotecan is not
applied in the clinic to breast cancer patients; hence, we have
investigated in a mouse model whether the use of this Top1
inhibitor is an alternative therapeutic approach for patients
with basal-like breast cancer. We used the K14cre;Brca1F/F;
p53 F/F genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), in
which Brca1−/−;p53−/− mammary adenocarcinomas arise, that
recapitulate key features of human BRCA1-associated breast
cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified)
and can be transplanted orthotopically into syngeneic mice
without loss of their genomic profile, morphology, or sensitivity to drug (8, 9). In this model inhibition of SSB repair by
the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib
(AZD2281; KU-0059436) induces DNA damage resulting in
synthetic lethality of Brca1−/−;p53−/− tumor cells and a strong
increase in overall survival (10). Remarkable responses to olaparib treatment with only few adverse effects were also observed in a phase I clinical trial with patients that carry
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (11). Because in our model olaparib treatment alone did not result in tumor eradication
(10), we have tested whether increasing the induction of SSBs

Sensitivity of Brca1−/−;p53−/− Tumors to Topotecan

by a Top1 poison would enhance antitumoral efficacy of this
PARP inhibitor.
Here we show that topotecan alone or in combination
with olaparib may be another therapeutic option for breast
cancer patients who carry cancers with HR defects. However,
we find that Brca1−/−;p53−/− tumors relapse and eventually
acquire resistance. Of the various mechanisms reported in
cultured cells to cause resistance to Top1 inhibitors (1, 12,
13), we identified only two in our model: an increased expression of the drug efflux transporter ABCG2 and reduced protein levels of the drug target Top1. We confirmed the in vivo
relevance of ABCG2 for topotecan resistance through orthotopic transplantation of Abcg2−/−;Brca1−/−;p53−/− tumors into
syngeneic wild-type mice. The generation of spontaneous
mammary tumors deficient for a drug efflux transporter
that might protect tumor-initiating cells from chemotherapy (14, 15) is novel and cannot be achieved in humans. Our
data strongly suggest that ABCG2 is dispensable for the
survival of tumor-initiating cells in this model.

Materials and Methods
Animals, generation of (Abcg2-deficient) mammary tumors, and orthotopic transplantation of tumor fragments
into syngeneic wild-type mice. Brca1−/−;p53−/− mammary tumors were generated and genotyped as described (8). To generate Abcg2 −/−;Brca1−/−;p53−/− mammary tumors, animals
carrying Abcg2-deleted alleles (16) were bred with K14cre;
Brca1 F/F ;p53 F/F mice to homozygocity (Abcg2 −/− ;K14cre;
Brca1F/F;p53F/F) on a mixed 129/Ola and FVB/N genetic background. Abcg2 genotypes were confirmed by PCR with specific primers (forward: 5′-CTTCTCCATTCATCAGCCTCG-3′)
for wild-type (reverse: 5′-GGAGCAAAGCTGCTATTGGC-3′)
and deleted alleles (reverse: 5′-CAGTCGATGGATCCACTTAGG-3′). Orthotopic transplantations, mammary tumor
measurements, and sampling were performed as explained
previously (9). All experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Netherlands Cancer
Institute.
Drugs and treatment of tumor-bearing animals. Topotecan was dissolved in glucose (5%, w/v) to yield a solution of
0.4 mg/mL (of active compound) and administered at 10 μL/g
of body weight by i.p. injection. When tumors reached a size
of ∼200 mm3, 4 mg/kg topotecan were administered i.p. daily
for 4 (Fig. 1A) or 5 (Fig. 1B) consecutive days or on days 0 to
4 and 14 to 18 (Figs. 1C, 3A and 4A). Tumors that responded
[volume, <50% 14 d after the first topotecan injection of the
first treatment course (Fig. 1A, B) or second course (Figs. 1C,
3A and 4A)] were left untreated until they relapsed to 100%.
If tumors did not respond (volume remaining, ≥50%), treatments were continued after a recovery time of 9 d after the
last treatment. Olaparib and tariquidar were applied as reported (10, 17). In topotecan-olaparib combination–treated
animals (Fig. 6B and C), the topotecan dose was lowered
8-fold to 0.5 mg/kg and administered on days 0 to 4, 14 to
18, and 28 to 32, whereas 50 mg/kg olaparib were injected i.p.
daily for 42 d and, when combined with topotecan, administered 15 min after topotecan injection. Tariquidar (2 mg/kg;

www.aacrjournals.org

Fig. 6C) was administered i.p. every second day during this
42-d period.
Genome-wide expression profiling. RNA extraction, amplification, microarray hybridization, data processing, and
statistical analyses were performed as described (9). Twocolor duplicate hybridizations on mouse microarrays (NKI
Central Microarray Facility) were used, containing 38,784
70-mer probes representing 23,527 genes and 35,172 gene
transcripts (MEEBO, Illumina BV). The microarray data reported in this article have been deposited in the Array Express database of the European Bioinformatics Institute
(Cambridge, United Kingdom; accession no. E-NCMF-28).
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis. (Reverse Transcriptase-)Multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) analyses on tumor DNA or
RNA were carried out as before (9, 17).
Immunohistologic analysis. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed as described (10). ABCG2 was probed
with the rat anti-mouse monoclonal (BXP53) from Abcam
(ab24115, 1:400) and detected with a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (Dakocytomation, E0468, 1:100).
Tumor protein extraction and Top1 immunoblotting.
Snap-frozen tumor samples were ground into a fine powder
by pestle in a liquid nitrogen cooled mortar and transferred
into 1.5-mL Eppendorf vials containing 20 μL 1× Lämmli lysis
buffer/mg tumor sample. Lysates were spun 5 min at 20,800 × g
to obtain the soluble protein fraction. The supernatants were
boiled for 5 min at 100°C, and equal amounts of protein were
size-fractionated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Protran BA83, Whatman). After a 2× 15-min block with
Blotto (5% w/v milkpowder in 1× TBS–0.1% Tween 20), both
anti-Top1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Topogen, 2012-2) and
anti-Lamin A/C (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz,
sc-20681) antibodies were used as probes and visualized
by enhanced chemoluminescence after incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG
(1:10,000; Dakocytomation, P0217). Top1 band intensities
were quantified digitally (ImageJ, NIH) in scanned pictures
of linearly exposed films and normalized to Lamin A/C.

Results
Brca1−/−,p53−/− mammary tumors respond to the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan but relapse and eventually acquire resistance. We established the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan in 12- to 14-week-old female K14cre,Brca1F/F,p53F/F mice to maximize antitumoral
drug efficacy and thereby mimicking a clinically relevant
dose (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Topotecan (4 mg/kg) i.p. on
4 consecutive days was tolerated and resulted in 10% to 20%
weight loss. When two animals carrying “spontaneous” mammary tumors (∼200 mm3 in volume) were treated with this
dose, tumors shrank (Fig. 1A, T1 and T2). Despite this good
response, tumors were not eradicated and relapsed. Once the
tumors grew back to a volume of ∼200 mm 3 (100%) or
showed progressive growth after a recovery period of 14 days
after the first topotecan injection, treatments were resumed.

Sensitivity of Brca1−/−;p53−/− Tumors to Topotecan

Eventually, both tumors acquired resistance to the MTD of
topotecan. In an attempt to eradicate the tumors by intensifying the topotecan therapy, we used wild-type animals with
orthotopically transplanted Brca1;p53-deficient tumors, because wild-type animals could take an additional dose of topotecan (4 mg/kg drug i.p. on 5 consecutive days; Supplementary
Fig. S1B). The orthotopically transplanted tumors responded
to topotecan like the primary tumors, but also the intensified topotecan therapy was unable to eradicate the tumors
(Fig. 1B, T3–T6). We therefore added a second MTD schedule
after a 14-day recovery period after the first topotecan injection and tested this treatment in 14 individual Brca1−/−;p53−/−
tumors (4 mg/kg drug i.p. on days 0–4 and 14–18; Fig. 1C, T7–
T20). Although some tumors became nonpalpable after this
dose-dense treatment, eventually all tumors relapsed and acquired topotecan resistance. Interestingly, the time until resistance developed varied substantially between individual
tumors, showing the response heterogeneity of these tumors.
In drug-sensitive tumors we identified a strong increase in
nuclear DNA damage foci 24 hours after a 5-day topotecan
schedule using γ-H2AX as marker (Supplementary Fig. S2).
γ-H2AX foci are associated with DSBs (18); hence, our finding supports the notion that topotecan-induced SSBs are
converted into DSBs in the tumors. Moreover, we observed a
significant decrease in the proliferation marker Ki-67 and an
increase in senescense-associated β-galactosidase activity, as
well as increased nuclear p19ARF staining (Supplementary
Fig. S3) after topotecan treatment. On the basis of published
findings in cell lines (19), we expected to find many apoptotic
cells. However, only a modest increase in apoptosis-related
cell death [cleaved caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive] was detected in shrinking tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S3A).
Abcg2 is frequently upregulated in topotecan-resistant
tumors. We looked for alterations in gene expression using
a two-class paired significance of microarray analysis (SAM)
comparing 39K oligo expression arrays of resistant to matched
untreated control tumor samples. We found elevated expression of 150 genes at a δ of 1.058 (false discovery rate of 2.21%;
Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S2). Of these 150 genes only
Abcg2 has previously been linked to topotecan resistance.
Abcg2 encodes the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux
transporter ABCG2/BCRP, which is known to cause topotecan
resistance in cultured cells (20, 21). Quantification of Abcg2
transcript levels confirmed that the level of Abcg2 was at least
2-fold elevated in 9 of 20 tumors (Fig. 2B, T1, T2, T4, T6, T9,
T11, T13, T15, and T16). Moreover, ABCG2-positive tumor
cells could be detected in situ (Fig. 2C) with the ABCG2-specific antibody Bxp53 (16), and immunoreactivity correlated with
Abcg2 transcript levels (Supplementary Table S3). The increased Abcg2 gene expression was not due to DNA amplification: we quantified the DNA content in whole tumor lysates by
MLPA and found no copy number alterations of Abcg2 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
ABC transporters other than ABCG2 that have been linked
to topotecan resistance by others (13, 22–27) include ABCB1A (MDR1A), ABCB1B (MDR1B), ABCC1 (MRP1), and

www.aacrjournals.org

ABCC4 (MRP4). Of these, only the expression of Abcb1a
and/or Abcb1b was elevated in a number of tumors: 9 of 20
tumors showed at least a 2-fold increase in Abcb1a or Abcb1b
transcript levels (Fig. 2B).
Doxorubicin-resistant and Abcb1a/b-overexpressing
tumors respond to topotecan after orthotopic transplantation. To investigate whether the mouse P-glycoproteins
ABCB1A and ABCB1B can cause topotecan resistance in our
tumor model, three individual doxorubicin-resistant and docetaxel cross-resistant Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors were orthotopically transplanted into syngeneic wild-type hosts and treated
with the MTD of several drugs (Fig. 3A). The tumors maintained their elevated Abcb1a and Abcb1b RNA levels (Fig. 3B)
and accordingly their resistant phenotype after transplantation but were completely sensitive to topotecan. This shows
that upregulation of the mouse P-glycoproteins by itself does
not lead to topotecan resistance in this tumor model.
Introduction of Abcg2 null alleles into the mouse model.
To study ABCG2-independent topotecan resistance mechanisms, Abcg2 null alleles were introduced into the K14cre,
Brca1 F/F ,p53 F/F mouse model (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Abcg2−/−,K14cre,Brca1F/F,p53F/F animals with spontaneous
mammary tumors cannot be treated with the topotecan
MTD established in Abcg2+/+ mice, because the ablation of
ABCG2 alters topotecan pharmacokinetics (28, 29). This
problem was solved by orthotopic transplantation of tumors
into syngeneic wild-type animals (Fig. 4A). In comparison
with Abcg2-proficient tumors, we found an increased topotecan sensitivity in Abcg2-deficient tumors resulting in an
augmented overall survival (P < 0.001; Fig. 4B). This confirms that ABCG2 is contributing to topotecan resistance
in vivo. Nevertheless, ablation of Abcg2 did not result in tumor eradication. Eventually, most of the Abcg2−/−;Brca1−/−;
p53−/− tumors developed topotecan resistance after a median latency of 137 days (n = 11) after start of treatment.
ABCG2-independent mechanisms of topotecan resistance. Alterations of the drug target Top1 result in camptothecin resistance in cultured cells (12, 13, 25). Several
point mutations, which disable camptothecin (analogue)–
mediated stabilization of Top1 cleavage complexes, have
been detected in the core and catalytic domain of Top1
(12, 13, 25, 30). We therefore sequenced nucleotides 1051 to
2257 (starting from ATG) of Top1 cDNA, which include the
previously described mutations. However, using Top1 cDNA
derived from five individual topotecan-resistant Abcg2−/−,
Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors (TB1, TB2, TB4, TB5, and TB8), we
did not find a single-point mutation analyzing eight independent clones per tumor (not shown). Another alteration reported to cause topotecan resistance is a reduction in the
level of the drug target (12, 31, 32). Yet, in both Abcg2-proficient
and -deficient tumors, we did not observe a significant decline of Top1 transcripts (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S6). Only
T10 showed a reduction of Top1 mRNA to 48% in the resistant
tumor compared with the control. At the protein level, however, immunoblotting revealed substantially decreased Top1
levels in five of nine topotecan-resistant Abcg2−/−,Brca1−/−,
p53−/− tumors compared with their matched untreated controls (Fig. 5A, TB1, TB2, TB8, TB9, and TB10). In addition, five

of eight Brca1 −/− ,p53 −/− tumors, lacking Abcg2 upregulation, also showed marked decreases in Top1 protein levels
(Fig. 5B, T5, T10, T18–T20). Downregulation of Top1 is
therefore another major biochemical mechanism of topotecan
resistance in this model.
Topotecan-olaparib combination therapy does not eradicate tumors either. Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors are sensitive to
the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and its combination with cisplatin or carboplatin increased the overall survival of tumor-bearing mice (10). Topotecan might even be more
effective in combination with olaparib, because topotecan increases SSBs, which require PARP-mediated repair. In the absence of functional PARP, topotecan should drastically
increase SSBs and thus increase synthetic lethality with
BRCA1 deficiency. When we tested 4 mg/kg topotecan i.p.
on days 0 to 4 in combination with 50 mg/kg olaparib i.p.
daily, the mice had to be killed due to diarrhea with accompanying weight loss that could not be compensated by additional fluid supplementation (Fig. 6A). This is not surprising,

1704

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

as PARP deficiency is known to sensitize mammalian cells to
Top1 poisons (33). The combination with olaparib was tolerated only when topotecan was lowered to 0.5 mg/kg i.p. on 5
consecutive days (Fig. 6A). We then treated Abcg2-deficient
Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors to avoid ABCG2-mediated topotecan
resistance and to maximize the chance of tumor eradication.
Nevertheless, the topotecan-olaparib combination did not
increase the relapse-free survival of four individual tumors
compared with olaparib as single agent (Fig. 6B, TB1, TB5,
TB7, and TB11). Even the addition of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor tariquidar to the regimen, to prevent Abcb1a/b-mediated
olaparib resistance (10), did not result in the eradication of
the tumors (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
We show here that spontaneous and transplanted Brca1−/−;
p53−/− mammary tumors are sensitive to topotecan, albeit
with considerable variability in drug response. The median

Sensitivity of Brca1−/−;p53−/− Tumors to Topotecan

overall survival of mice with transplanted tumors under
the dose-densest topotecan therapy (T7–T20) was 53.5 days
(±39 SD) compared with 8 days (±1 SD) of their matched untreated controls (Fig. 1C). Such intertumoral differences,
which did not correlate with a specific histomorphology, were
also observed with other drugs in this model (9, 10) and seem
to mimic the response heterogeneity seen in patients. We
know that tumors differ in additional mutations acquired
after the initial Brca1 and p53 deletion (8), and these must
be responsible for response variability.
Despite their initial sensitivity, tumors eventually acquire
resistance to the MTD of topotecan. Research with cell lines
has identified several mechanisms of camptothecin/topotecan resistance. These include overexpression of the drug efflux transporters ABCG2, ABCC4, ABCB1, ABCC2, reduced
expression of Top1, Top1 mutations, Top1 mislocalization,
elevated DNA repair, and resistance to apoptosis (reviewed
in refs. 1, 12, 13). Which of these mechanisms contribute to
topotecan resistance in real tumors has remained unclear,
however (34, 35). We show here that increased levels of
ABCG2 are a major mechanism of topotecan resistance
in vivo, as in cultured cells (21, 36, 37). The importance of this
mechanism is illustrated by the Abcg2−/− tumors in which the
development of topotecan resistance was substantially delayed (Fig. 4B). Abcg2−/−;Brca1−/−;p53−/− tumors can still de-

velop full topotecan resistance, however, and a substantial
decrease in the level of Top1 can explain resistance in several
of these tumors. Remarkably, this profound decrease in Top1
protein was not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in
Top1 mRNA in most tumors, in sharp contrast with the observations on camptothecin-resistant tumor cell lines (12, 32,
38). If downregulation of Top1 would also be posttranscriptional in human tumors, its detection by gene expression
profiling would be impossible. Top1 degradation is mediated
by ubiquitin- or SUMO1-associated posttranscriptional modification (39–42), and which mechanism applies in our mouse
tumors is under investigation.
It is notable that some mechanisms of topotecan resistance identified in cell lines, such as upregulation of ABCC4
or mutations in Top1, have not yet turned up in our tumor
model. ABCG2-mediated drug efflux or downregulation of
Top1 can explain topotecan resistance in 14 of 20 individual
Brca1−/−;p53−/− tumors, and the study of topotecan resistance
in the remaining tumors is ongoing.
P-glycoprotein is not such an effective transporter of topotecan as ABCG2 (23, 43, 44), but how effective it is cannot
be deduced from the literature. Relative resistance levels
up to 20-fold have been reported (25), although most recent
papers find much lower P-glycoprotein–mediated resistance
or transport (45–47). Our results show that even a 53-fold

Sensitivity of Brca1−/−;p53−/− Tumors to Topotecan

Figure 5. Western blot analysis of Top1 levels in topotecan-resistant tumors. Lysates of nine resistant Abcg2−/−, Brca1−/−, p53−/− tumors (TB1–TB4 and
TB6–TB10; A) and lysates of eight resistant Brca1−/−, p53−/− tumors without increased Abcg2 gene expression (T5, T8, T10, T12, and T17–T20; B)
were probed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human Top1 antibody (Topogen) and compared with matched topotecan-sensitive controls (Top1 MW = 100 kDa).
As loading control we used Lamin A/C, detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human antibody (Santa Cruz; Lamin A MW = 69 kDa, Lamin C MW = 62 kDa).
Resistant/control ratios of relative Top1 band intensities are indicated for each individual tumor.

upregulation of P-glycoprotein, which makes the tumor completely resistant to doxorubicin, does not result in clear-cut
resistance to topotecan. In real tumors, P-glycoprotein is
therefore unable by itself to cause topotecan resistance. Nevertheless, we found in many tumors a significant (2- to 13fold) upregulation of the Abcb1 genes (Fig. 2B). Although
this could be incidental, we think that P-glycoprotein,
in conjunction with other weak resistance mechanisms,
could allow the tumor cell sufficient time to develop more
robust resistance. Effective cooperation between ABCG2
and P-glycoprotein in the defense against topotecan penetration into the brain has been documented by de Vries and colleagues (48). Whereas only minor increases (up to 2-fold) of
brain topotecan were found in Abcg2−/− or Abcb1a/1b−/− mice,

the compound knockout mice showed 12-fold increased
brain penetration relative to wild-type mice. This shows that
P-glycoprotein can significantly contribute to the prevention
of cellular topotecan accumulation, if it gets help.
It is remarkable that deletion of Abcg2 did not result in
tumor eradication by topotecan. ABCG2 has been proposed
as a critical factor in the chemotherapy resistance of tumorinitiating cells of various tumor types (14, 15, 22), but our
results argue against this proposal. We cannot exclude that
topotecan does not reach remnant tumor cells but we consider this unlikely, as there are no obvious histologic sanctuaries in the remnants. Another possibility is that the
tumor-initiating cells are protected by another drug efflux
transporter, but there is no evidence for this either. Our

under topotecan therapy. A, response of Abcg2;Brca1;p53-deficient tumors to the MTD of topotecan. Animals with orthotopically transplanted
Abcg2;Brca1;p53-deficient mammary tumors (volume, ∼200 mm3) were left untreated (pink line) or treated with 4 mg/kg topotecan i.p. on days 0 to 4 and 14
to 18. When tumors relapsed or showed progressive growth (tumor size, ≥50%) after a recovery period of 14 d after the day 0 injection, treatment was
resumed as indicated by the arrows. B, overall survival (%) over time (d) of wild-type animals carrying orthotopically transplanted Abcg2-proficient
(T7–T20) or -deficient (TB1–TB11) Brca1−/−, p53−/− mammary tumors. Topotecan was administered as in A and Fig. 1C. All animals carrying
Abcg2-proficient tumors and 10 of 11 animals carrying Abcg2-deficient tumors had to be killed, because the resistant tumor reached a volume of ∼1,500
mm3. One animal (TB11) had to be sacrificed due to a rectum prolapse on day 198, before having acquired full topotecan resistance. The P value was
calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Figure 6. Response of transplanted Abcg2−/−,Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors to topotecan-olaparib combination therapy. A, relative animal weights (%) in
response to topotecan-olaparib combination treatment. Female wild-type (FVB/N × 129/Ola)F1 animals were treated with 4 mg/kg topotecan i.p. on days 0,
1, 2, 3, and 4 in combination with 50 mg/kg olaparib i.p. daily (blue triangles). On day 5 the animals had to be killed due to severe weight loss caused
by diarrhea. Weight monitoring in response to the 8-fold lower dose of 0.5 mg/kg is shown as red squares. The average of five animals is presented. Error
bars, SD. B, response of four Abcg2−/−,Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors (TB1, TB5, TB7, and TB11) to topotecan (orange) and olaparib (brown) monotherapy or
topotecan-olaparib (green) combination therapy (untreated controls in blue). Animals received 0.5 mg/kg topotecan i.p. on days 0 to 4, 14 to 18, and 28 to
32; 50 mg/kg olaparib i.p. daily for 42 d or both antitumor agents in these dosages combined. After a 42-d dosing schedule animals were left untreated
and screened for tumor relapse. C, response of the same Abcg2−/−,Brca1−/−,p53−/− tumors as in B to tariquidar-topotecan and tariquidar-olaparib treatment
and tariquidar-topotecan-olaparib combination therapy. In addition to the same olaparib and topotecan dosages as in B, animals received 2 mg/kg
tariquidar i.p. every second day during 42 d of drug administration to prevent ABCB1A/B-mediated olaparib resistance. After a 42-d dosing schedule
animals were left untreated and screened for tumor relapse.

current hypothesis is that remnant tumor cells arrest in the
cell cycle and thereby escape anticancer drug-mediated cell
death (49). This hypothesis is supported by the observation
that cycling cells (Ki-67 positive) are drastically reduced after treatment. Because we found many senescent-like cells in
the topotecan-sensitive tumors after treatment, it is possible
that therapy-induced senescence allows escape from topotecan-induced cell death.
How cells in topotecan-sensitive tumors are killed is unclear. We found only a slight increase in apoptosis-related
cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL immunoreactivity, as was also
observed in reponse to olaparib (10). Necrosis or mitotic catastrophe (50) may be more important mechanisms of cell death
in this tumor, but we cannot exclude that cleaved caspase-3–
mediated cell cycle–dependent apoptosis is only detectable
for a short period of time and therefore underestimated in

tumor sections. In vitro studies with Brca1−/−;p53−/− cells are
in progress to settle this issue. In any case, our data show that
in vivo imaging of apoptosis is not a suitable readout for therapy response in this tumor model.
To explore new therapeutic alternatives for breast cancers
associated with BRCA1 defects, we tested the combination of
topotecan with the PARP inhibitor olaparib. This combination did not result in tumor eradication, even if we prevented
efflux of topotecan by using Abcg2−/− tumors and P-glycoprotein–mediated olaparib extrusion by inhibiting this transporter with tariquidar. We also observed this lack of
complete cell kill when olaparib was combined with platinum drugs (10). It is clinically relevant that the topotecanolaparib combination proved so toxic in mice that we had
to reduce the topotecan concentration 8-fold. We have not
seen this increased toxicity in the combination of olaparib

Sensitivity of Brca1−/−;p53−/− Tumors to Topotecan

with cisplatin or carboplatin (10). We do not think that topotecan toxicity is increased because olaparib inhibits ABCG2,
because methotrexate transport by ABCG2-overexpressing
cells was not altered by olaparib (data not shown). It seems
more likely that the level of endogenous DNA damage requiring PARP-mediated repair is already close to the maximum
that normal cells can deal with. A further increase in SSBs
induced by topotecan would overtax the DNA repair capacity
remaining in the absence of functional PARP.
Our study shows that GEMMs of human cancer are not
only useful for studying the response of real tumors to drugs
but also for the identification of resistance mechanisms actually occurring in vivo. Eventually, novel strategies to prevent or reverse topotecan resistance can be tested in this
model as well.
