ABSTRACT
Drug resistance hinder most cancer chemotherapies and leads to disease
recurrence and poor survival of patients. Resistance of cancer cells towards
apoptosis is the major cause of these symptomatic behaviours. Here, we showed that
isoquinoline alkaloids, including liensinine, isoliensinine, dauricine, cepharanthine and
hernandezine, putatively induce cytotoxicity against a repertoire of cancer cell lines
(HeLa, A549, MCF-7, PC3, HepG2, Hep3B and H1299). Proven by the use of apoptosisresistant cellular models and autophagic assays, such isoquinoline alkaloid-induced
cytotoxic effect involves energy- and autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7)-dependent
autophagy that resulted from direct activation of AMP activated protein kinase
(AMPK). Hernandezine possess the highest efficacy in provoking such cell death
when compared with other examined compounds. We confirmed that isoquinoline
alkaloid is structurally varied from the existing direct AMPK activators. In conclusion,
isoquinoline alkaloid is a new class of compound that induce autophagic cell death
in drug-resistant fibroblasts or cancers by exhibiting its direct activation on AMPK.

INTRODUCTION

the activation of mTOR prevents the phosphorylation of
Ulk1 activation through Ser 757, which finally inhibits
the Ulk1-AMPK dependent induction of autophagy
[4]. AMPK stimulates autophagy through the inhibition
of mTORC1, which is the key regulator of growth
factor and nutrient signals transduction [4]. Recently,
small-molecule AMPK activators have been identified
as potential therapeutic agent for metabolic diseases or
cancers [2, 8,  9]. Natural compounds such as α-Lipoic
acid, polyphenols (resveratrol) and isoquinoline alkaloid
(berberine); small molecule activators such as A-769662,
metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and alkyl benzo­
quinones could directly or indirectly activate AMPK in
a variety of cell types [10, 11]. In fact, autophagy may
play its anti-cancer role by preventing accumulation
of damaged proteins and organelles which lead to the
progression of tumor growth [12], or via the induction of
autophagic cell death [13].
Hernandezine, an alkaloid isolated from Chinese
medicinal herb, has long been used for treating hypertension
and angina pectoris [14, 15]. There was report suggesting
hernandezine blocks the influx of calcium via non

Autophagy is a highly coordinated process respon­
sible for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis under
nutrient deprivation conditions. This process involves
the lysosomal degradation of cellular components such
as misfolded proteins or damaged organelles. Defects in
autophagy are correlated to the pathogenesis of diseases
such as cancer, myopathy and neurodegeneration [1].
AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), maintains normal
energy balance by regulating cellular metabolisms in an
AMP/ADP ratio-dependent manner, is responsible for
the proper mechanistic modulation of autophagy [2].
During cellular starvation, AMPK induces autophagy
by phosphorylating Ulk1, the mammalian counterpart
of ATG1, at Ser 317 and 777 [3, 4]. Molecular studies
demonstrated that Ulk1 together with another mammalian
ATG1 homolog, Ulk2, form complex with mATG13 and
FIP200 (mammalian homologues of ATG13 and ATG17)
and regulate the autophagic machinery [5, 6]. Yeast
models have also suggested the inductive role of ATG1
kinase in autophagy [7]. Under nutrient-rich conditions,

selective cation channels in HL-60 cells [16]. Further
study showed that the calcium influx triggered by
depletion of internal calcium stores was blocked by
hernandezine [17]. In the present study, we depicted
the role of hernandezine in inducing autophagy and
autophagic cell death in apoptosis-resistant cells via the
direct activation of AMPK.

LO2, were used for comparison. As shown in Figure 1B,
hernandezine demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects
towards all these cancer cells types, especially on A549
lung cancer (mean IC50, 7.59 µM), HepG2 liver cancer
(mean IC50, 7.42 µM), Hep3B liver cancer (mean IC50,
6.71 µM) and H1299 lung cancer (mean IC50, 6.74 µM). In
contrast, hernandezine exhibited relative low cytotoxicity
towards normal liver hepatocytes, LO2 (mean IC50,
65.1  µM), suggesting that its specific cytotoxic effect
towards cancer cells.

Hernandezine induces autophagic GFP-LC3
puncta in various types of cancer cells

We previously demonstrated that a group of
alkaloid compounds including liensinine, isoliensinine,
dauricine and cepharanthine exhibit potent anti-cancer
effect via autophagy induction [13]. Hernandezine, an
alkaloid isolated from Thalictrum glandulosissimum
sharing structural similarity with isoquinoline alkaloids
(Figure 1A), may also possess potent anti-cancer efficacy.
To investigate the anti-cancer effect of hernandezine, a
panel of cancer cells, including HeLa (cervical), A549
(lung), MCF-7 (breast), PC3 (prostate), HepG2 (liver),
Hep3B (liver) and H1299 (lung) were adopted in the
cytotoxicity assay, whereas normal human hepatocytes,

To confirm whether hernandezine is capable
of inducing autophagy in variety of cancer cells, we
utilized HeLa, MCF-7, PC-3, Hep3B, A549 and H1299,
and LO2  normal human hepatocytes for detecting the
autophagic GFP-LC3 puncta. As shown in Figure  2A,
10  μM of hernandezine induced GFP-LC3 puncta
formation in all the cancer cells and normal hepatocytes,
indicating the autophagic effect of hernandezine is
not cell-type specific. However, quantitation of the
percentages of cells with autophagic puncta formation
showed that, different cancer cell types possess
different potency for autophagy induction in response

to hernandezine treatment (Figure 2B). In addition,
the formation of LC3-II puncta was further verified
by immunofluorescence staining against endogenous
LC3-II in HeLa cancer cells (Figure  2C). Besides, the
hernandezine-induced autophagic effect was further

validated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a well-known
PI3K inhibitor commonly used to inhibit autophagy [18].
As demonstrated by the decreased percentage of cells with
GFP-LC3 puncta formation (Figure 2D), addition of 3-MA
abrogated hernandezine-induced autophagy.

Hernandezine induces autophagic flux in HeLa
cancer cells

B, D and L; or bafilomycin, which inhibits the fusion of
autophagosome and lysosome by raising lysosomal pH
[19, 20]. As expected, hernandezine increased the rate of
LC3-II formation in the presence of the inhibitors when
compared with the use of inhibitors or hernandezine
alone (Figure 3A and 3B). This result suggested that
hernandezine induced autophagic activity through
enhanced autophagic flux and autophagosome formation.
We further monitored the autophagic flux using
mRFP-GFP tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 (tfLC3)
plasmid. Given that the localisation pattern of GFP-LC3

Induction of autophagy indicated by an increased
formation of GFP-LC3 puncta using fluorescence
microscopy, or LC3 lipidation using western blot, can
be resulted from either an induction of autophagic flux
or failure in fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.
Hence, we measured the conversion of soluble LC3-I to
lipid-bound LC3-II in the presence of E64d and pepstatin
A, which inhibit lysosomal proteases including cathepsins

Figure 3: Hernandezine induced autophagic flux in HeLa cancer cells. (A and B) Hernandezine induced LC3-II conversion in the

presence of lysosomal inhibitors. HeLa cells were treated with 10 µM of hernandezine in the presence or absence of 10 mg/mL lysosomal protease
inhibitors (E64d and pep. A) for 24 h, or 50 nM bafilomycin A for 8 h. Cell lysates were analysed by western blot for LC3 conversion (LC3-I,
18 kDa; LC3-II, 16 kDa) and β-actin. LC3-II band intensities were quantified using densitometric analysis and normalised to β-actin. Data were
expressed as a fold change relative to the DMSO-treated negative control. Bar charts were representatives of three independent experiments.

GFP+ (yellow) puncta were scored; scale bar, 15 mm. Each correlation plot was derived from the field shown in the immunofluorescence
image. The colocalisation of mRFP with GFP signal from tfLC3 puncta was measured using ImageJ software. The percentage of colocalisation
was displayed in the bar chart. The values indicated the average of at least five images. Error bars, S.D., ***P < 0.001.

Hernandezine-induced autophagy promotes cell
death

and tfLC3 are different, the LC3 fusion construct with
both red (mRFP) and green (GFP) fluorescence proteins
is therefore widely used for detection of autophagosomes
[21]. Due to the difference in the stability of GFP
and mRFP under different pH conditions [22], acidic
environment of lysosome will quench the GFP signal but
not the mRFP signal. Therefore, we overexpressed the
tfLC3 plasmid to monitor autophagic flux. As shown in
Figure 3C, while the yellow merged image (mRFP+-GFP+)
represents the autophagosomes, merged images with
red puncta (mRFP+-GFP−) indicates autophagic flux
with the formation of autolysosomes [21]. Our results
demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in the percentage
of cells with mRFP-GFP colocalisation after hernandezine
treatment, confirming the induction of autophagic flux by
this alkaloid in HeLa cancer cells.

Autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) is essential for
vesicle nucleation and elongation during autophagy [20].
Previous studies showed that Atg7-knockout mice die due
to their failure in adaptation of neonatal starvation [25].
Meanwhile, cancer cells lacking Atg7 gene are insensitive
to small-molecules-induced autophagy [13, 26].
To determine whether hernandezine requires Atg7 for
autophagy induction, GFP-LC3 transfected Atg7-wild-type
and -deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were
incubated with hernandezine for 24 h. The hernandezinetreated MEFs were then fixed for quantification of GFPLC3 puncta formation. As shown in Figure 5A, 10 μM
of hernandezine increased GFP-LC3 puncta formation in
Atg7 wild-type MEFs, but not in Atg7-deficient MEFs,
indicating the involvement of Atg7 in hernandezineinduced activation of autophagy.
A number of anti-cancer agents have been reported
to induce autophagy in various types of cancers [27],
however it remains controversial whether autophagy
promotes cell death or acts as a pro-survival mechanism.
Studies showed that Atg7-deficient MEFs are resistant to
induction of autophagy [25]. As hernandezine-induced
autophagy required Atg7 (Figure 5A), we therefore
utilized both Atg7 wild-type and Atg7-deficient MEFs
to determine whether hernandezine-induced autophagy
leads to cell death or acts as a pro-survival mechanism
[19]. Results showed that hernandezine exhibited less
cytotoxicity in Atg7-deficient MEFs when compared to
their wild-type counterparts (Figure 5B), similar results
were found in HeLa cancer cells with Atg7 knockdown
(Figure 5C). These data suggested that hernandezineinduced autophagy could lead to autophagic cell death,
because the failure in the induction of autophagy in Atg7deficient cells suppressed the hernandezine-induced cell
death. Hernandezine-induced autophagy requires the
involvement of Atg7 and promotes cell death in cancer
cells.

Hernandezine activates AMPK kinase for
induction of autophagy and cell death
AMPK is a sensor of cellular energy status and
is activated under high intracellular AMP conditions
such as hypoxia or nutrient deprivation, thereby induces
autophagy via the mTOR-dependent pathway [23].
Phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target
Acetyl-Coenzyme A Carboxylase (ACC) are required for
small-molecule induced autophagy [24]. As demonstrated
by western blot analysis, AMPK phosphorylation
was increased in response to hernandezine treatments
(Figure 4A). The phosphorylation was accompanied by
a reduction in phosphorylated p70S6K, a downstream
target of mTOR (Figure 4A). Concomitantly, ACC, the
direct downstream target of AMPK, was phosphorylated
upon hernandezine treatments (Figure 4A, lower panel).
In addition, a decrease in hernandezine-induced GFP-LC3
autophagic puncta formation was observed in cells
pre-treated with the AMPK inhibitor compound C
(CC) (Figure 4B), suggesting the involvement of
AMPK signalling in hernandezine-induced autophagy.
Alternatively, supplementation of glycolytic intermediate,
methyl pyruvate (MP), was able to suppress hernandezineinduced LC3-II conversion and GFP-LC3 puncta
formation (Figure 4C and 4D), suggesting hernandezineinduced autophagy involved energy depletion. To
address whether hernandezine-induced cell death is due
to energy depletion, we examined its cytotoxicity with
the presence of methyl pyruvate using annexin V flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 4E, while hernandezine
induced cell death in HeLa cancer cells, the addition of
methyl pyruvate abolished the compound-induced cell
death. Most importantly, cell-free AMPK kinase assay
has revealed that liensinine, isoliensinine, dauricine,
cepharanthine and hernandezine, could activate the AMPK
kinase activity dose-dependently (Figure 4F). All these
evidence suggested that isoquinoline alkaloid activates on
AMPK kinase directly.

Hernandezine induces autophagic cell death in
apoptosis-resistant cancer cells
Cancer cells are frequently resistant to drug-mediated
apoptosis [28]. Therefore, the use of small-molecules
to induce autophagic cell death in apoptosis-defective
or apoptosis-resistant cancer cells may become a prom­
ising therapeutic approach [13, 29]. To investigate if
the identified AMPK activator hernandezine can exhibit
cytotoxic effects towards apoptosis-resistant cells, we
adopted a panel of apoptosis-defective or apoptosisresistant cells such as caspase 3/-7/-8 deficient MEFs,
Bax-Bak double knockout (DKO) MEFs and DLD-1 BaxBak DKO human colon cancer cells as the cellular models.
As shown in Figure 6A, hernandezine demonstrated

cancer cells were also adopted to evaluate the potential
anti-cancer effect of hernandezine. For this purpose, taxolresistant HCT-8 colon cancers were incubated with 10 µM
of hernandezine in the presence of CC prior to annexin

cells (Figure 7C).

as liensinine, isoliensinine, dauricine and cepharanthine,
trigger cell death in a non-apoptotic manner, therefore,
immortalized cell lines with hampered apoptosis are
sensitized to their stimulation. This alkaloid-induced
cellular toxicity is associated with the up-regulation
of Atg7-dependent autophagy, which is potentially
beneficial to anti-cancer therapy [13]. Although the
molecular mechanisms underpinning the alkaloidinduced cell death is still elusive, we and others
have demonstrated that the AMPK-mTOR signaling
cascade is activated by these alkaloids [13, 30–32].
Although other natural compounds such as co-enzyme
Q (CoQ), and polyphenol including flavonoids, lignans,
stilbenes and phenolic acids were found intertwining with
the AMPK signaling pathway [33–35], there is lack of
evidence pointing towards the direct activation of AMPK

DISCUSSION
Natural alkaloids namely isoquinoline alkaloids
comprising the common structure of isoquinoline
nucleus, have been shown to possess anticancer
properties as demonstrated by their cytotoxic effect on
various types of cancer cells [13]. These alkaloids such

by these compounds. CoQ and polyphenol activate AMPK
signaling via the upstream kinases, Ca2+–stimulated
kinase (CaMKK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which
are correlated to their therapeutic potency upon different
disease conditions such as obesity, hyperglycemia and
insulin resistance [33–35]. Other studies showed that
genistein (flavonoid) contributes to obesity control by
regulating the transcriptional expression of fatty acid
ω-hydroxylase (CYP4F2) through the manipulation of
CaMKK [36]. Sauchinone (lignan) activates AMPK
phosphorylation by LKB1 kinase, which perturbed the
iron-induced oxidative mitochondrial stress and lead
to the alleviation of chronic disorders progression [37].
Also, application of CoQ10 to the 3T3-L1 adipocytes
culture have demonstrated the anti-adipogenic effect of
CoQ is mechanistically relevant to the CaMKKβ-AMPKaxis-driven peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
alpha (PPAR-α) expression [38].
AMPK activators are ideal pharmacological com­
pounds for cancer therapy, since mTOR kinase that
frequently activated in a wide spectrum of tumors are
negatively regulated by the LKB1-AMPK pathway
[39–41]. Both in vitro and animal studies have highlighted
the anti-cancer effect of direct activation of AMPK. MT
63–78 (Debio 0903), a direct AMPK activator, thwarts
the growth of androgen sensitive and castration resistant
prostate cancer cell model (CRPC), and reduces tumor
volume of mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) or orally treated
with the compound [42]. Recent studies showed that BLAD008 is a novel dual-target activator of AMPK/ZIPK
and induces apoptosis in cervical cancer [43]. Commonly
prescribed anti-diabetic drug, metformin, functioning
through direct AMPK activation has epidemiologically
been proven to downscale the occurrence of pancreas,
colon and hepatocellular carcinoma in type 2 diabetic
patients [44–47]. Other studies demonstrated that
metformin potentiates anticancer effect of dasatinib in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells via AMPKdependent ER stress [48]. It is noteworthy that, metformin
has already been approved in clinical trials for the treatment
of pancreatic and breast cancers (http://clinicaltrials.gov,
IDs NCT01210911, NCT01266486). The association
of high glucose uptake with elevated cancer cell
proliferation also reinforced the notion of applying AMPK
activators clinically for cancer therapy and prevention
[49]. Higher mortality rate and cancer risk are linked
to the pathological condition of excessive circulatory
glucose concentration such as hyperglycemia [50].
AMPK activation in hernandezine-treated cancer cells
was induced when the cellular energy state is suppressed,
suggesting the close relationship between metabolic
glucose anomalies and the pharmacological action
of hernandezine towards cancer cell death. However,
activation of AMPK may protect cancer cells in response
to the micro-environmental stresses that the cancer
cells are encountering [51, 52]. Therefore, clinical trials
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

designated to define the optimal clinical stages for AMPK
activator application is needed for maximizing their
efficacy.
In line with our previous findings that isoquinoline
alkaloid is able to induce autophagic cell death in
cancer cells [13], hernandezine-induced cytotoxicity
is autophagy-dependent. Similar to other isoquinoline
alkaloids,
hernandezine-induced
cytotoxicity
is
independent of apoptosis. By using a wide spectrum of
caspase (-3/-7/-8) and Bax/Bak-deficient cell lines, we
concluded that hernandezine may activate autophagic
cell death without Bax-Bak or caspases. Apoptoticrelated mitochondrial/cytochrome c pathway is frequently
disrupted in human cancers and many malignancies
[27, 53]. Most chemotherapy-resistant cancers are having
defective apoptotic pathways. For example, the Bax-Bak
double-knockout MEFs are resistant to various apoptosisinducing agents [53]. Caspase-3, -8 and -9 are associated
with apoptosis-resistance and drug-resistance phenotypes,
as well as apoptosis induced by anti-cancer agents [54].
Although caspase-3 activation is crucial to apoptosis, study
showed that the induction of apoptosis could be happened
in the absence of caspase-3 [55]. Recent studies further
highlighted that induction of autophagy for treatment
of cisplatin-resistant and p53 mutated cancers [56].
Therefore, novel pharmaceutical interventions inducing
cancer cells cytotoxicity through non-apoptotic signaling
is inevitable. Hernandezine or generally isoquinoline
alkaloids may actually serve more than simply an anticancer agent. AMPK is engaged with glucose and lipid
metabolisms extensively in different organs and tissues,
controlling pancreatic insulin secretion, fatty acid and
cholesterol synthesis in liver, lipolysis in adipose tissue,
cardiac and skeletal fatty acid oxidation, and glucose
uptake [57–60]. Apart from glucose concentration,
factors like hormones and cytokines are stimuli of
AMPK, illustrating the involvement of multiple pathways
in AMPK regulation [61–63]. Therefore, AMPK is
positioned at the center of AMPK-mTOR cascade making
the kinase the key molecular target for pharmaceutical
interventions of different metabolic disorders.
Literatures concerning the direct action of natural
compounds on AMPK are scarce. Up to 2012, around
26 patent applications claiming the discovery of direct
AMPK activators have been filed [64]. These smallmolecules AMPK activators belong to the derivatives
of thienopyridone, cyclic benzimidazole, pyrimidine,
alkene oxindole and ring-fused imidazole [64]. Accurate
examination disclosing that they are reminiscent to
each other due to the 4-(2-hydroxypheny)phenyl-side
chain and a negatively ionizable group. These structural
resemblances seem not to be a mandatory criteria for
AMPK activation, because structural modifications
of this particular side chain do not induce notable
differences in AMPK activation [64]. However, the robust
AMPK activation induced by hernandezine, liensinine,
8099

Oncotarget

isoliensinine, dauricine and cepharanthine agreed with this
observation as they do not contain the 4-(2-hydroxypheny)
phenyl-side chain. Accordingly, we have proposed a new
class of compound exhibiting direct activation of AMPK
kinase, and widen the chemical scope for searching new
direct AMPK activators.
Isoquinoline alkaloid is a direct activator of AMPK
and autophagy, and exhibits its anti-cancer property by
inducing cancer cell death. Provided that our candidates
are structurally different from other proprietary direct
AMPK activators, the present study unveils a novel class
of natural small-molecule directly activating AMPK which
induces autophagy particularly on apoptotic-resistance
cancer.

China). All cells were cultured with medium supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin,
and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland,
UK). All cell cultures were incubated in a humidified
incubator at 37ºC with 5% CO2.

Quantification of GFP-LC3 puncta formation
GFP-LC3 puncta were quantified as described
previously [26]. Localisation of GFP-LC3 and the
fluorescent images were acquired using high magnification
widefield epifluorescence microscopy. Images were
captured by a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera
on the Olympus IX71-Applied Precision DeltaVision
restoration microscope (Applied Precision, Inc, USA), and
the epifluorescence images were numerically deconvolved
using DeltaVision algorithms (Applied Precision, Inc.).
To quantify autophagy, the percentage of autophagic cells
was calculated by counting the number of cells showing
increased punctate pattern of GFP-LC3 and dividing by
the total number of GFP-positive cells. A minimum of
1000 cells from randomly selected fields was scored per
condition per experiment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, plasmids and antibodies
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from
Sigma (MO, USA) unless otherwise stated. Hernandezine
was purchased from China Chengdu Biotech­
nology
Company Ltd. (Chengdu, China) (> 98% purity, HPLC).
E64D, pepstatin A, bafilomycin A and compound C were
obtained from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). The
pEGFP-LC3 and mRFP‑GFP tandem fluorescent‑tagged
LC3 (tfLC3) plasmids were gifts from Prof. Tamotsu
Yoshimori (Osaka University, Japan). Antibodies against
LC3B, p-AMPK (Thr172), AMPK, p-p70S6K (Thr389),
p70S6K and p-Acc were purchased from Cell Signalling
Technologies Inc. (Beverly, MA). The ZyMax™ TRITCconjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were
purchased from Invitrogen (Scotland, UK). Actin antibody
was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA).

Endogenous autophagy detection
Hernandezine-treated cancer cells on cover slips
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and
then immersed in methanol for 2 min. Cells were then
incubated with anti-LC3 antibody (1:200) in TBST
(100 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween
20 and 5% BSA) overnight at 4°C. Cells were incubated
with anti-mouse secondary antibody (TRITC) (1:200) in
TBST containing 5% BSA at 37°C for 1 h in the dark. The
coverslips were mounted with FluorSave™ mounting media
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for fluorescence
imaging. Localization of LC3 autophagosomes were
captured under the API Delta Vision Live-cell Imaging
System (Applied Precision Inc., GE Healthcare Company,
Washington, USA). Standard guidelines were followed
to monitor autophagy [20]. The percentage of autophagic
cells was calculated by counting the number of the cells
showing increased punctuate pattern of LC3 fluorescence
(≥ 10 dots/cell) in immunofluorescence positive cells over
the total number of cells in the same field. A minimum of
1000 cells from randomly selected fields were scored.

AMPK kinase assay

REFERENCES

AMPK kinase assay was performed using CycLex®
AMPK Kinase Assay Kit (MBL, Japan) according to
manufacturing instructions. In brief, 0.2 ng of AMPK
(α1/β1γ1) active enzyme (CycLex Co., Ltd.) was incubated
in well with 10X of hernandezine (50 & 100  μM) or
10X of positive control, AMP (100 µM) in kinase assay
buffer (50 μM ATP & 10 mM DTT) at 30oC for 20 min.
The reaction was then stopped by washing with buffer for
5 times. Then, anti-phospho-mouse IRS-1 S789 monoclonal
antibody was added to each well at room temperature
for 30 min. After washing with buffer for 5 times, HRPconjugated anti-mouse IgG was added to each well at room
temperature for 30 min. After washing with wash buffer,
the TMB substrate reagent was incubated in wells at room
temperature for 5–15 min. Stop solution was added to each
well before measuring absorbance at 450/550 nm.
