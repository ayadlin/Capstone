Abstract

Author Manuscript

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma localized
predominantly in body cavities. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus is the causative agent of
PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and has extremely poor prognosis when treated with
conventional chemotherapy. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide
are FDA approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines within their clinically achievable
concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell-cycle, and without any induction of
KSHV lytic-cycle reactivation. Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with
lenalidomide revealed activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not
block the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved cereblon-dependent
suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not IKZF3. Small hairpin-RNA (shRNA)
mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs. Bromodomain and
extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers which perform a vital role in
chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional
coactivator, belongs to BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the superenhancers associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed which suppress MYC

transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several structurally distinct
BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151, and PFI-1). Furthermore, combined administration of
lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly increased the survival of PEL bearing
NOD.SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft model as compared to either agent alone. These
results provide compelling evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with
BRD4 inhibitors for PEL.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
localized predominantly in body cavities that is observed primarily in patients with human
1
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and is associated with infection by Kaposi’s
2
sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) . The prognosis of PEL is extremely poor with
3
median survival of 4 and 6 months in HIV-positive and -negative patients, respectively.
Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new treatment regimens for PEL.

Author Manuscript

Thalidomide and its analogues, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are collectively known as
4
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Thalidomide was originally introduced as a sedative but
5
was later withdrawn from the market due to birth defects and neuropathy. Subsequently,
thalidomide was found to significantly improve the response rate and survival of patients
6
with multiple myeloma (MM). The second generation IMiDs, lenalidomide and
pomalidomide, possess more potent anti-myeloma, anti-inflammatory and
5
immunomodulatory activities than thalidomide. Thalidomide directly binds to and inhibits
7
the cereblon (CRBN) ubiquitin ligase, and CRBN has been shown to be required for the
8 9
anti-myeloma activity of IMiDs. , Lenalidomide-bound CRBN acquires the ability to
degrade Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3), two specific B-cell
transcription factors. The loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 was shown to be both necessary and
10 11
sufficient for the anti-myeloma effect of lenalidomide. ,

Bromodomain (BRD)-containing proteins regulate lysine acetylation , an important
mechanism to regulate chromatin structure. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET)
subfamily has four members, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, all of them share common
domain structure. Recently, potent and highly specific BRD4 inhibitors were
13 15
developed – . These inhibitors were shown to suppress MYC transcriptionally and
16 18
demonstrate promising preclinical activity against MYC-driven cancers – .
Here, we report that PEL cells are highly sensitive to IMiDs, lenalidomide and
pomalidomide within their physiologically achievable concentrations. Furthermore, we
discovered that low-dose combinations of IMiDs with BRD4 inhibitors, displayed
synergistic anti-proliferative activity against PEL.

Results
IMiDs show selective cytotoxicity towards PEL

Author Manuscript

To examine the cytotoxicity of IMiDs against PEL, we treated a panel of 35 logarithmically
growing hematopoietic cell lines (Supplementary Table 1) for 5 days with increasing
concentrations of IMiDs. At concentrations that are achievable clinically [2.2 μM for
19
20
lenalidomide and 179 nM for pomalidomide ], 6 out of the 9 PEL cell lines (BC-3,
BCBL-1, JSC-1, VG-1, UMPEL-1, and UMPEL-3) were sensitive to IMiDs with IC50
ranging from 0.2–1.2 μM and 32–111 nM for lenalidomide and pomalidomide, respectively
(Figure 1A and Table1). Whereas BC-1, BCP-1 and APK-1 were sensitive to only higher
doses of IMiDs with IC50 ranging from 2.6–10 μM and 226–744 nM for lenalidomide and
pomalidomide, respectively (Figure 1A and Table 1). MM.1S (Myeloma), Daudi (Burkitt’s
lymphoma) and TMD8 (Activated B-Cell Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma; ABC-DLBCL)
were also sensitive to both IMiDs with IC50 ranging from 0.2 – 2.1 μM and 38–113 nM for
lenalidomide and pomalidomide, respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). All the remaining
cell lines were either resistant to IMiDs or required higher doses for a moderate effect
8
(Supplementary Figure S1). Consistent with its known requirement for in vivo metabolism,
thalidomide did not have any major effect on the growth of any of the cell lines tested or
required a high dose for moderate effect (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1).
Treatment of PEL cells with IMiDs resulted in G1 cell-cyle arrest (Figure 1B and
Supplementary Figure S2A). In contrast, IMiDs had no major effect on cell-cycle
progression in DG-75 (Burkitt lymphoma) and OCILY-8 (Germinal Center B-cell Diffuse
Large B-Cell Lymphoma; GCB-DLBCL) cells that were resistant to their anti-proliferative
effect (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2A).

GSEA analysis identifies activation of interferon signaling in PEL by lenalidomide

Author Manuscript

To delineate the gene network affected by lenalidomide, BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells were
treated with lenalidomide (5 μM) for 24 hours (h) followed by genome-wide microarray
analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated samples according to their
treatment group, indicating a common transcriptional response to treatment with
lenalidomide in PEL (Figure 1C). Rather than inducing non-specific changes in gene
expression, lenalidomide induced significant changes in a limited number of genes. Thus,
there were 992 genes (390 down- and 602 up-regulated genes) whose expression were
changed significantly (p<0.05) in both the cell lines. We used a Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) program to identify functional gene sets that were enriched in PEL cells
21
upon treatment with lenalidomide. Among the gene signatures identified by this analysis
were gene sets containing genes that are known targets of interferon (IFN) and MYC
signaling pathways (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S2B). We used qRT-PCR to
confirm up-regulation of IFNs and interferon specific genes (ISGs) by lenalidomide in PEL
(Supplementary Figure S2C).
Interferons α, β & γ are cytotoxic to PEL but are not essential for the anti-proliferative
effect of IMiDs
In the case IMiDs block the proliferation of PEL by activating the IFN pathway, then
treatment with recombinant IFNs (rIFNs) should mimic the effect of IMiDs. To test this

hypothesis, we treated a panel of cell lines with increasing concentrations of rIFNs α, β and
γ. All the PEL cell lines were sensitive to recombinant IFNs α, β or γ (Figure 2A). In
particular, BC-3, BCBL-1 and JSC-1 were highly sensitivity to IFNs α and β. Although
BC-1 and VG-1 cells were relatively resistant to IFNs α and β, they were sensitive to IFN-γ.
In contrast, DG-75 and BJAB, the two IMiD-resistant cell lines, showed little or no
inhibitory effect upon treatment with any IFN (Figure 2A).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, the neutralizing antibodies against IFNs α, β and γ, when used singly
(Supplementary Figure S3) or in combination (Figure 2B), did not block the antiproliferative effect of IMiDs against PEL although they effectively blocked the antiproliferative effect of their respective rIFNs. Further none of the interferons were secreted
into the supernatants of the PEL cells treated with IMiDs (Figure 2C). Collectively, these
results suggest that activation of the interferon pathway is not solely responsible for the antiproliferative effect of IMiDs against PEL.
IMiDs have no effect on KSHV lytic replication in PEL
It was conceivable that induction of KSHV lytic replication contributed to the cell death and
activation of IFN signaling observed following treatment with IMiDs. KSHV Replication
22
and Transcription Activator (RTA), is a master regulator and marker for lytic reactivation.
Treatment of PEL cell lines with IMiDs failed to induce RTA expression, as determined by
immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure S4A). Additionally, we failed to detect infectious
virions in the supernatant from IMiDs-treated PEL cells when assayed on 293-PAN-Luc
23
reporter cell line (Supplementary Figure S4B). Thus, IMiDs do not induce lytic
reactivation of KSHV.

IMiDs down-regulate IRF4 expression in PEL
24

Author Manuscript

MM cells are addicted to IRF4 and the anti-proliferative activity of lenalidomide and
pomalidomide in myeloma and ABC-DLBCL is associated with down-regulation of
25 26
IRF4. , To delineate the role of IRF4 in the survival of PEL and in their response to
IMiDs, we used western blotting to compare its expression in a panel of 35 cell lines
comprising 11 hematologic malignancies, including 9 PEL cell lines. Expression of IRF4
was robust in all cell lines derived from PEL, MM, ABC-DLBCL, Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia and Hodgkin lymphoma, but was weak to absent in the cell lines derived
from other hematologic malignancies (Figure 3A). Treatment of BC-3, BCBL-1 and JSC-1
with IMiDs resulted in significant decrease in the expression of IRF4 and its downstream
target MYC, thus suggesting that IMiDs exert their cytotoxicity towards PEL by downregulating IRF4 (Figure 3B). In contrast IMiDs had no significant effect on the levels of
IRF4 and MYC in DG-75 cells (Figure 3B).

PEL cells have constitutive NF-κB activity due to the presence of KSHV viral proteins –
30
and aberrant NF-κB activity has been shown to up regulate the expression of IRF4 . To test
whether IMiDs represses IRF4 expression by inhibiting NF-κB pathway, BC-3 and BCBL-1
cells stably expressing an NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct were treated
with increasing concentrations of IMiDs. As shown in Supplementary Figure S5A, IMiDs
failed to block NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase activity. Further, no change in the

secretion of IL-6, a known target of classical NF-κB pathway , processing of p100 into
p52, and expression of NF-κB pathway proteins, were observed in IMiDs-treated PEL cells
(Supplementary Figure S5B–C). Taken collectively, these results demonstrate that IMiDs
have no significant effect on the constitutive NF-κB activity present in PEL cells.
PEL cells are addicted to IRF4 for survival

Author Manuscript

To provide genetic evidence in support of the hypothesis that IMiDs exert their cytotoxic
effect against PEL through down-regulation of IRF4, we studied the effect of IRF4
knockdown in BC-3 cells. For this purpose, we generated a polyclonal population of BC-3
cells expressing a tetracycline-inducible-H1 (TO/H1) promoter-driven shRNA targeting
IRF4 (shIRF4) (Supplementary Figure S6A–B) followed by generation of single cell clones
(Supplementary Figure S6C). Upon treatment with doxycycline (Dox) significant downregulation of IRF4 was observed in a number of clones (Supplementary Figure S6C). Down24
regulation of MYC, a target of IRF4, and cleavage of PARP upon Dox-treatment was
observed only in those clones where IRF4 was down-regulated (Figure 4A and
Supplementary Figure S6C). Strikingly, Cellular proliferation was decreased rapidly only in
clones were IRF4 is down-regulated upon treatment with Dox (Figure 4B and
Supplementary Figure S6D). Treatment of a clone, BC-3-shIRF4-F11 with Dox resulted in
G1 cell-cycle arrest (Figure 4C) and appearance of cells with condensed and fragmented
nuclei suggestive of apoptosis (Figure 4D), a finding further confirmed by staining with
annexinV/propidium iodide (Figure 4E). In contrast, Dox treatment had no significant
effects on cell-cycle progression and apoptosis in BC-3-shSCR cells (Figure 4C–E).
Collectively, the above results suggest that down-regulation of IRF4 is toxic to BC-3 cells by
inhibiting cell-cycle progression and through induction of apoptosis.

IMiDs rapidly down-regulate IKZF1 and silencing of IKZF1 is toxic to PEL

Author Manuscript

Ikaros family proteins IKZF1 and IKZF3 are B cell transcription factors that play crucial
32
roles in immunity and cell-fate decisions. Recently, it was shown that IMiDs selectively
10 11
degrade these transcription factors in MM cells. , In PEL, both IMiDs led to significant
and near complete down-regulation of IKZF1 in all the three PEL cell lines even at the
lowest concentration (i.e. 0.5 μM lenalidomide and 50 nM pomalidomide) tested, but had
only a modest effect in the DG-75 cell line (Figure 5A). In contrast, the effect of IMiDs on
the level of expression of IKZF3 was modest at best and, in general, required higher doses of
the drugs (Figure 5A). Consistent with the results seen with IMiDs, silencing of IKZF1 by
two different shRNAs were selectively toxic to PEL cells (Figure 5B and Supplementary
Figure S7A), and was accompanied by partially reduced expressions of IRF4 and MYC
(Figure 5C). Additional studies revealed that IMiDs down-regulate IKZF1 expression at the
post-translational level (Supplementary Figure S7B–C). Furthermore, time-course
experiments revealed rapid and near complete down-regulation of IKZF1 expression as early
as 12 h post-treatment even at the lowest concentrations of both IMiDs (Figure 5D). In
contrast, the levels of IRF4 and MYC were less sensitive to down-regulation by IMiDs
(Figure 5D). Thus, near complete down-regulation of these proteins was either not observed
or required treatment with longer duration (i.e. 48 h) and higher concentrations of the drugs
(Figure 5D). Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that IKZF1 is an upstream
target of IMiDs in PEL.

We also checked the hypothesis that IKZF1 may be responsible for the high level expression
of IRF4 observed in PEL cells. We found that IRF4 and IKZF1 are both consistently
expressed in PEL, myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, ABC-DLBCL and
Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines. However, there was little correlation between IRF4 and
IKZF1 expression in cell lines derived from other hematologic malignancies (Supplementary
Figure S8). Therefore, while it is possible that IKZF1 may contribute to the overexpression
of IRF4 (and MYC) in PEL, it is unlikely to be the sole regulator of their expression.
CRBN is dispensable for the survival of PEL

CRBN. – However, we failed to observe a significant and consistent effect of IMiDs on the
expression of CRBN in BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells (Figure 6A). It has been shown that
8
silencing of CRBN by shRNA significantly decreases the proliferation of MM and ABC25
DLBCL cells. We generated polyclonal populations of BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells stably
10
expressing a TO/U6 promoter-driven shRNA targeting CRBN (shCRBN). Treatment of
shCRBN-expressing cells with Dox for 4 days significantly down-regulated the expression
of CRBN (Figure 6B, Upper panel), while Dox-treatment was without effect in control
shRNA-expressing cells (Figure 6B, Upper panel). Interestingly, silencing of CRBN
expression did not have any significant effect on the proliferation of BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells
(Figure 6B, lower panel). Thus, in contrast to myeloma and ABC-DLBCL cells, CRBN is
dispensable for the survival of PEL.
CRBN is essential for the anti-proliferative effect of IMiDs in PEL

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next asked the question if CRBN is essential for the activity of IMiDs in PEL. Although
IMiDs significantly inhibited the proliferation of shCON-expressing PEL cells, the antiproliferative activity of IMiDs was almost completely blocked in shCRBN-expressing PEL
cells (Figure 6C). Furthermore, treatment with IMiDs failed to induce G1 cell-cycle arrest in
shCRBN-expressing PEL cells, but successfully did so in shCON-expressing PEL cells
(Supplementary Figure S9). Further, IMiDs treatment resulted in near complete abrogation
of IKZF1 expression in shCON-expressing BC-3 and BCBL-1, which was accompanied by
a significant decrease in the expressions of IRF4 and MYC but was without any effect on the
expression of CRBN (Figure 6D). Remarkably, IMiDs had no significant effect on the
expression levels of IKZF1, IRF4 and MYC in the shCRBN- expressing BC-3 and BCBL-1
cells. (Figure 6D). In addition, CRBN is essential for the post-translational degradation of
IKZF1 by IMiDs, as observed by a complete block in the degradation of IKZF1 by IMiDs in
shCRBN-expressing cells (Figure 6E). Whereas, IKZF1 was degraded within 1 h by IMiDs
in shCON-expressing cells (Figure 6E). These results clearly suggest that CRBN is essential
for the anti-proliferative potential of IMiDs in PEL. However, we did not observe a
significant difference in the level of expression of CRBN between IMiDs-sensitive andresistant cell lines (Supplementary Figure S10), suggesting that the resistance to IMiDs in
these cells is not linked to CRBN expression.
Knocking down MYC by shRNA enhances the sensitivity of IMiDs to PEL
To test if the loss of MYC could synergize with IMiDs, we generated polyclonal population
of BC-3 cells stably expressing TO/H1-driven shRNAs targeting MYC (shMYC) and a

scrambled sequence (shSCR). Consistent with our published results , treatment of BC3shMYC cells with Dox resulted in a significant down-regulation of MYC (Figure 7A),
which was accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation (Figure 7B), while without any
effect on BC-3-shSCR cells (Figure 7A–B). Interestingly, knockdown of MYC significantly
enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of IMiDs (Figure 7C), which was accompanied by cellcycle arrest and apoptosis (Figure 7D–E). In contrast, no significant difference in cell
proliferation, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis was observed in BC-3 shSCR cells treated
with IMiDs in the presence or absence of Dox (Figure 7C–E). These results pointed to the
existence of a potential synergism between IMiDs and inhibition of MYC.
BRD4 inhibitors JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1 are synergistic with IMiDs in PEL

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Recently, it has been shown that MYC transcription can be targeted using BRD4
16 18
inhibitors. – JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1 are three structurally distinct BRD4
13 15
inhibitors. – To test whether IMiDs show synergistic anti-proliferative activity when
combined with BRD4 inhibitors, BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells were treated with low doses of
lenalidomide in combination with low doses of JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1, respectively. The
combination index (CI) was calculated using the calcusyn software, which is based on the
33
method of Chou and Talalay. Lenalidomide was highly synergistic with all BRD4
inhibitors at all the combination doses tested in both BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells (Figure 7F and
Supplementary Tables 2–8). In contrast, lenalidomide is not synergistic with the inactive
isomer of JQ-1 in either cell line (Supplementary Tables 9–10). Furthermore, combined
treatment with lenalidomide and JQ-1 in BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells significantly decreased the
expression of MYC and IRF4 at both protein (Figure 8A) and mRNA (Supplementary
Figure S11A) levels as compared to treatment with either drug alone. The combination of
lenalidomide with JQ-1 also resulted in G1 cell-cycle arrest, cleavage of PARP, and
appearance of apoptotic cells as compared to treatment with either drug alone
(Supplementary Figure S11B and Figures 8A–B, respectively).
Knocking down BRD4 by shRNA enhances the sensitivity of IMiDs to PEL

Author Manuscript

To confirm whether the observed synergism between lenalidomide and the BRD4 inhibitors
is due to inhibition of BRD4, we generated stable clones of BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells
expressing TO/H1 promoter-driven shRNA targeting BRD4 (shBRD4). Treatment of BC-3
and BCBL-1 cells expressing shBRD4 with Dox resulted in a significant down-regulation of
BRD4 (Figure 8C and Supplementary Figure S11C) and decrease in cellular proliferation
(Figure 8D and Supplementary Figure S11D), while Dox treatment had no effect on BRD4
expression or cellular proliferation in BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells expressing a scrambled
shRNA sequence (shSCR) as control (Figure 8C–D and Supplementary Figure S11C–D).
More importantly, Dox enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of IMiDs in the shBRD4expressing BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells but was without effect in shSCR-expressing cells (Figure
8D and Supplementary Figure S11D).
Lenalidomide and JQ-1 are synergistic against PEL in vivo
To check the in vivo efficacy of lenalidomide, alone and in combination with JQ-1, BC-3
cells were injected into the intra-peritoneal cavity of NOD.SCID mice. Five days after the
injection, animals were randomly assigned to vehicle control, lenalidomide (50 mg/kg once

daily for 28 days), JQ-1 (50 mg/kg once daily for 28 days), and the combination.
Intraperitoneal inoculation of BC-3 cells resulted in rapid tumor growth and massive ascites,
which resulted in weight gain (Figure 8E). There was a significant reduction (p≤0.01) in
34
body weight gain (a measure of ascites) of animals treated with lenalidomide and JQ-1
when compared to vehicle control (Figure 8E). Additionally, the combination of
lenalidomide and JQ-1 showed a further reduction in body weight gain over time when
compared with mice treated with either agent alone (Figure 8E). Furthermore, the median
survival of mice that received combination treatment (51 days) was significantly (p≤0.01)
increased as compared with the median survival of mice treated with lenalidomide (35 days)
or JQ-1(42 days) alone (Figure 8F).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

In this report, we demonstrate that majority of the PEL cells are highly sensitive to
lenalidomide and pomalidomide, two FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of MM. Both
drugs have predictable and manageable safety profiles and limited cumulative long-term
35 36
toxicity, , making them attractive treatment options for PEL.

The anti-proliferative action of lenalidomide in PEL cell lines was associated with the
activation of the IFN signaling pathway. However, we did not detect IFN in the supernatant
of IMiDs-treated cells and neutralizing antibodies against IFNs failed to block the activity of
25
IMiDs against PEL. Since IRF4 has been recently shown to modulate IFN signaling, these
results prompted us to explore the role of IRF4 in the anti-proliferative effects of IMiDs in
PEL. We observed that IRF4 is not only uniformly expressed in PEL cell lines but is
significantly down-regulated following treatment with IMiDs. Furthermore, shRNAmediated silencing of IRF4 was toxic to PEL cells, thereby supporting the argument that
down-regulation of IRF4 contributes to the anti-proliferative effect of IMiDs in PEL.
Expression of IRF4 in myeloma cells has been attributed to their plasmacytic
24
37
differentiation. As PEL cells resemble plasma cells in the gene expression profile, the
uniform expression of IRF4 in these cells may also reflect their plasma cell lineage. IRF4
25 38
expression is also a feature of ABC-DLBCL. , In these cells oncogenic mutations
39 40
affecting the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MYD88 signaling pathways induce NF-κB, ,
41
which is a strong inducer of cytotoxic IFNβ. IRF4, however, places a brake on IFNβ
25
production by repressing IRF7, thereby allowing ABC-DLBCL to survive and proliferate.
Furthermore, IRF4 is believed to promote ABC-DLBCL survival by transactivating
25
CARD11 and potentiating NF-κB signaling. Although oncogenic mutations affecting the
BCR and MYD88 signaling pathways have not been reported in PEL, they do possess
constitutively active NF-κB signaling pathway due to the activity of KSHV-encoded viral
27 28 42
FLICE Inhibitory Protein (vFLIP) K13. , , Therefore, similar to ABC-DLBCL, IRF4
may be up-regulated in PEL cells to augment the pro-survival aspect of NF-κB signaling
while simultaneously protecting against the deleterious effects (e.g. IFNβ production) of
uncontrolled NF-κB activation. IRF4 is also known to bind to MYC promoter and stimulate
24
MYC gene expression. Even though PEL cells lack structural alterations in the MYC
43
gene, they nevertheless demonstrate elevated MYC expression, which has been shown to
44
be essential for their survival and proliferation. The over-expression of IRF4 in PEL might
contribute to the elevated MYC expression observed in these cells.

IMiDs were shown to degrade both IKZF1 and IKZF3 in MM. , In contrast, we observed
that IKZF1 was the primary target of IMiDs in PEL cells. The expression of IKZF1 was
down-regulated earlier than IRF4 and MYC. Additionally, IKZF1-specific shRNAs was not
only toxic to PEL cells but also partially down-regulated the expression of IRF4 and MYC.
IKZF1 has been previously shown to bind to IRF4 promoter and regulate its expression at
10
24
the transcriptional level. Furthermore, MYC is a known transcriptional target of IRF4.
Taken collectively with prior studies, our results suggest that degradation of IKZF1 by
IMiDs down-regulates IRF4 expression at the transcriptional level, which in turn,
downregulates MYC expression.

CRBN is the direct cellular binding-target of IMiDs and essential for their
8 9
immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities. , We observed that CRBN is
dispensable for the survival of PEL, which is in contrast to the situtation in MM and ABCDLBCL cells where shRNA-mediated knock down of CRBN has been reported to be
8 25
toxic. , However, while CRBN is not essential for the survival of PEL, it is essential for
the anti-proliferative activity of IMiDs in PEL since all the IMiDs induced anti-PEL effects
are blunted in cells expressing an shRNA targeting CRBN.

Our study along with work of others suggest that MYC is one of the down-stream target of
IMiDs in PEL. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the antiproliferative effect of IMiDs on PEL, thus suggesting a potential synergism between IMiDs
16 18
and inhibition of MYC. BRD4 inhibitors have been shown to block MYC expression. –
In support of this premise, we observed striking synergy between low doses of lenalidomide
and BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1) against PEL. Furthermore, shRNAmediated BRD4 knockdown also enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs towards PEL
suggesting that the synergism observed between IMiDs and BRD4 inhibition may not be
limited only to the BRD4 inhibitors used in our study. There are several potential
explanations for the observed synergism between IMiDs and BRD4 inhibitors. First, since
inhibition of MYC is not complete upon treatment with lower doses of IMiDs (Figure 5D);
addition of low doses of BRD4 inhibitors may eliminate any residual MYC expression seen
following IMiDs treatment. Second, apart from MYC, BRD4 inhibitors are known to
45
modulate the expression of other genes , which may have synergistic cytotoxicity when
combined with IMiDs. Finally, in addition to degrading IKZF1/IKZF3 via CRBN, IMiDs
may also degrade other proteins, which may result in synergistic cytotoxicity when
combined with BRD4 inhibitors.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we provide strong in vitro and in vivo data showing that IMiDs are effective
against PEL and combined treatment of IMiDs with BRD4 inhibitors have synergistic
activity against this deadly incurable cancer. BRD4 inhibitors have shown promising activity
against multiple cancers in pre-clinical studies and at present there are 5 BRD4 inhibitors in
12
phase 1–2 clinical trials. Our results suggest that IMiDs, alone and in combination with
BRD4 inhibitors, deserve further testing for the treatment of PEL. While this study was in its
final stage of completion, a case report was published describing the successful treatment of
46
a PEL patient with lenalidomide, which supports our pre-clinical data.

A total of 2×107 BC-3 cells were injected intraperitoneally into female NOD.SCID mice
(NCI Frederick, 6 weeks old). 5 days later the mice were randomly divided in to 4 groups
(n=7 each). Investigators are not blinded. Vehicle control (10 % Hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin), lenalidomide 50 mg/kg b.w. (once daily), JQ-1 50 mg/kg b.w. (once daily) and
the combination were administered intraperitoneally for 28 days. Then the animals were
monitored for survival. Body weight gain was measured once in 3 days as a surrogate
34
measure of tumor progression . The experiments were performed following the approval of
institutional animal ethics committee of University of Southern California.
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used to test for differences between two groups.
Differences with a p value ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The data’s were
given as mean±SE. All the experiments were reproduced at-least twice. No inclusion/
exclusion criteria are applied and none of the samples or animals was excluded from the

CRBN is dispensable for the survival of PEL cells but is essential for the anti-proliferative
activity of IMiDs in PEL cells. A, Immunoblot analysis showing the effect of lenalidomide
(Len) and pomalidomide (Pom) at the indicated doses for 48 h on the expression of cereblon
(CRBN) and GAPDH in BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells. The band corresponding to CRBN is
marked with an asterisk. Blots are representative of 2 individual experiments. B, Upper
panel: BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible shRNA targeting
CRBN (shCRBN) and shRNA targeting scrambled sequence (shCON) were treated with
doxycycline (Dox, 500 ng/ml) for 4 days and immunoblotted for the expression of CRBN,
GAPDH and TUBA. Blots are representative of 2 individual experiments. Lower panel:
BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells stably expressing shCON and shCRBN were treated with Dox for
indicated time points and cell viability was measured by MTS assay. The values shown are
mean±SE of a representative experiment performed in triplicate for 2 times. C, BC-3 and
BCBL-1 cells stably expressing shCON and shCRBN were pre-treated with Dox for 3 days
followed by treatment with vehicle and IMiDs at indicated concentrations for 6 days in the
presence of Dox and cell viability was measured by MTS assay. The values shown are mean
±SE of a representative experiment performed in triplicate for 3 times. D, BC-3 and BCBL-1
cells stably expressing shCON and shCRBN were pre-treated with Dox for 3 days followed
by treatment with vehicle and IMiDs at indicated concentrations for 48 h in the presence of
Dox and cell lysates were collected and immunoblotted for indicated proteins. Blots are

representative of 2 individual experiments. E, BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells stably expressing
shCON and shCRBN were pre-treated with Dox for 3 days followed by treatment with
vehicle or IMiDs along with Dox in the presence of 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) for
0, 1, 2, and 3h respectively. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for IKZF1, CRBN and
GAPDH. Blots are representative of 2 individual experiments. Note: The CRBN antibody
gives a non-specific band when CRBN is probed as first antigen but when the blot is probed
for some other antigen then stripped and probed for CRBN then the intensity of the nonspecific band is decreased or gone.

Knocking down MYC enhances the anti-proliferative effect of IMiDs in PEL, BRD4
inhibitors and IMiDs display synergistic anti-proliferative activity against PEL. A, BC-3
cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible H1 promoter (H1/TO)-driven shRNA targeting
MYC (shMYC) and shRNA targeting scrambled sequence (shSCR) were treated with
doxycycline (Dox, 500 ng/ml) for 4 days and immunoblotted for the expression of MYC and
GAPDH. Blots are representative of 2 individual experiments. B, BC-3 cells stably
expressing shSCR and shMYC were treated with Dox for indicated time points and cell
viability was measured by MTS assay. The values shown are mean±SE of a representative
experiment performed in triplicate for 3 times. C, BC-3 cells stably expressing shSCR and
shMYC were treated in the presence/absence of Dox with indicated concentrations of IMiDs
or vehicle for 72 h and cell viability was measured by MTS assay. Asterisks (***) indicate
significance at the level of p≤0.001. The values shown are mean±SE of a representative
experiment performed in triplicate for 3 times. D, Cell cycle analysis of BC-3 cells stably
expressing shSCR and shMYC that were treated in the presence/absence Dox with indicated
concentrations of IMiDs or vehicle for 72 h. Data is representative of 2 individual

experiments. E, Apoptosis analysis of BC-3 cells stably expressing shSCR and shMYC that
were treated in the presence/absence Dox with indicated concentrations of IMiDs or vehicle
for 48 h. Data is representative of 2 individual experiments. F, BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells were
treated with low doses of lenalidomide (Len) in combination with low doses of three
structurally different BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1) for 5 days and then
assessed for viability using MTS assay. Combination index (CI) was calculated using the
33
calcusyn software which is based on the method of Chou and Talalay. Each BRD4
inhibitor was tested in combination with lenalidomide at 12 different combinations (please
see supplementary Tables 2–8 for details). CI values of <1 denotes synergism and CI values
>1 denotes antagonism. Data presented is representative of 3 individual experiments
performed in triplicate.
