BACKGROUND: Although many patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) respond well to imatinib
therapy, a significant proportion loses their initial response. Loss of response on imatinib is often because
of BCR-ABL mutations. Dasatinib is a 325-fold more potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl than imatinib and has been
associated with high rates of durable responses in patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) after imatinib
failure. METHODS: To determine the optimal time for initiating dasatinib after loss of response on imatinib,
data from dasatinib trials in CML-CP were analyzed. Patients were grouped according to whether they
received early intervention with dasatinib (ie, after cytogenetic recurrence on imatinib), rather than after
both cytogenetic and hematologic recurrence. RESULTS: Overall, 72% of patients who received dasatinib
after loss of a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) on imatinib achieved a complete cytogenetic response
(CCyR) compared with 42% of patients who were treated after loss of both MCyR and complete hematologic response (CHR). Event-free survival (EFS) also was higher after earlier dasatinib treatment (24-month
EFS rates: 89% after loss of MCyR on imatinib vs 29% after loss of both MCyR and CHR). Among patients
who were treated after loss of CHR on imatinib with no prior MCyR, 26% achieved a CCyR with dasatinib,
and the 24-month EFS rate was 64%. In all 3 groups, CCyR rates were similar in patients with or without
pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggested that optimal
outcomes are achieved when dasatinib is administered early after imatinib resistance. Cancer

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a reciprocal
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) chromosomal translocation that gives rise to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and
the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The resulting Bcr-Abl oncoprotein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that
promotes the growth advantage of leukemia cells through enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis
and promotes genomic instability through inhibition of DNA repair.1 Greater than 80% of patients are

diagnosed with CML during the initial chronic phase
(CP).2 Without effective therapeutic intervention,
patients with CML-CP inevitably progress to advanced
phases of disease and have a short survival.
Currently, treatment of CML is based on efficient blockade of Bcr-Abl activity. Imatinib mesylate
(Glivec [Gleevec in the US]; Novartis Pharmaceuticals,
Basel, Switzerland) was the first Bcr-Abl–targeted agent
approved for the treatment of CML.3,4 Although most
patients respond well to imatinib therapy, an estimated
31% of patients who were treated during the phase
3 International Randomized Study of Interferon and
STI571 or IRIS trial did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within 12 months, and 0.4%
to 5.5% of patients who achieved a CCyR experienced
treatment failure each year.3 Resistance to imatinib
most commonly is a result of mutations that cause
conformational changes or that alter critical residues
within the imatinib-binding region of the Bcr-Abl
oncoprotein.5
Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New
York, NY) is a second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitor that is
indicated for the treatment of adults with CML in all
phases who have resistance or intolerance to imatinib. In
vitro, dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib.6
Dasatinib treatment has induced a high rate of durable
responses among patients with both resistance and intolerance to imatinib, including patients with all BCR-ABL
mutations examined, except for the threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I).7-9
The timing of second-line treatment after failure of
initial treatment may have a significant impact on longterm outcome. Among patients who received imatinib after failure on prior interferon-a (IFN) therapy, improved
responses and higher rates of survival were achieved if
imatinib was initiated at the time of cytogenetic recurrence rather than after hematologic recurrence.10,11 Similarly, a recent analysis of patients with imatinib failure
identified the administration of second-line treatment after hematologic resistance or recurrence as an independent
prognostic factor for poor survival compared with treatment after cytogenetic resistance/recurrence (P ¼ .01; 3year overall survival (OS) rate, 57% compared with 92%,
respectively).12 The objective of the analysis presented
here was to assess the impact of earlier intervention with
dasatinib (ie, after cytogenetic recurrence rather than after

hematologic recurrence on imatinib) on subsequent
response rates and long-term outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Patient data were analyzed retrospectively from 3 dasatinib trials in patients with CML-CP: CA180-013,
CA180-017, and CA180-034 (Table 1). Study CA180013 (START-C) is a phase 2 trial of dasatinib administered at a dose of 70 mg twice daily in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance (N ¼ 387).7 Study CA180017 (START-R) is a phase 2 randomized trial of dasatinib
versus imatinib dose escalation in patients who were resistant to imatinib at doses from 400 mg daily to 600 mg
daily, including 101 patients who received dasatinib (70
mg twice daily).13 In both the CA180-013 study and the
CA180-017 study, dose escalation to 90 mg twice daily
was permitted for patients who were not responding or
progressing, and dose interruption or reduction to 40 mg
twice daily was permitted for adverse events. Study
CA180-034 is a randomized, phase 3 dose-optimization
trial in patients with imatinib resistance (including both
suboptimal response and treatment failure) or intolerance
(N ¼ 670).14 Dasatinib was administered at 1 of 4 dosing
schedules: 100 mg once daily (n ¼ 167), 50 mg twice
daily (n ¼ 168), 140 mg once daily (n ¼ 167), or 70 mg
twice daily (n ¼ 168). Escalation to 180 mg once daily or
90 mg twice daily was permitted for lack of response, and
dose interruption or reduction to 80 mg once daily or 40
mg twice daily was permitted for adverse events. Each trial
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board/
ethics committee at each participating center. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Response Definitions and Assessments
A complete hematologic response (CHR) was defined as a
white blood cell count no higher than the institutional
upper limit of normal, an absolute neutrophil count 1
 109/L, a platelet count <450  109/L and no more
than the institutional upper limit of normal, <5% myelocytes plus metamyelocytes in peripheral blood, <20%
basophils in peripheral blood, and no extramedullary

involvement, all maintained for at least 4 weeks. Cytogenetic responses (CyRs) were classified according the percentage of Ph-positive metaphases in bone marrow using
the following standard definitions: 0% Ph-positive metaphases, complete CyR (CCyR); and from 1% to 35% Phpositive metaphases, partial CyR (PCyR). A major CyR
(MCyR) was defined as the sum of CCyRs and PCyRs
(ie, 35% Ph-positive metaphases). A major molecular
response (MMR) was defined as a reduction in BCR-ABL
transcripts to 0.1% compared with the international
standardized baseline BCR-ABL:ABL ratio.
Assessments in the current analysis comprised rates
of CHR, MCyR, CCyR, event-free survival (EFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), and overall survival (OS).
All cytogenetic responses during dasatinib treatment
were assigned using conventional cytogenetic assessment
of Ph-positive metaphases in bone marrow samples. Rates
of MMR were analyzed in the CA180-013 study only
and are reported using all assessed patients as the
denominator.
Events that were included in the EFS analysis were
transformation to accelerated phase or blast phase, loss of
CHR or MCyR, increasing white blood cell count (dou2914

bling of the count from the nadir to >20,000/mm3 or by
>50,000/mm3, on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart) in
patients who did not achieve CHR, or death. Events that
were included in TFS analysis included transformation to
accelerated phase or blast phase or death. For the OS analysis, patients in the CA180-017 study who were included
in the current analysis but who had subsequently crossed
over to imatinib treatment (n ¼ 10) were censored at the
time of crossover.
Patients were analyzed according to the presence of
mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain before dasatinib therapy as measured by direct sequencing. The ATP
phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) region of Bcr-Abl was
defined as residues 248 through 256.

Patient Groups
The main objective of this analysis was to assess whether,
in patients with CML-CP and imatinib failure, treatment
with dasatinib after loss of MCyR (ie, earlier intervention)
compared with after loss of MCyR and CHR (ie, later
intervention) resulted in improved outcomes. For this
analysis, patients with CML-CP and acquired resistance

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
In total, 293 patients with loss of MCyR or CHR were eligible for the current analysis. There were 151 patients in
Group 1 (loss of MCyR), 33 patients in Group 2 (loss of
MCyR and CHR), and 109 patients in Group 3 (loss of
CHR without prior MCyR) (Table 2). Among the 33
patients who had lost MCyR and CHR during imatinib
treatment (Group 2), the simultaneous loss of both
responses was recorded in 4 patients, and all other patients
had loss of MCyR followed eventually by loss of CHR.
Across the 3 groups, >50% of patients had received
imatinib at a dose >600 mg daily, and 60% had
received imatinib for >3 years (Table 2). The median duration of CML was shorter in the loss of MCyR group
(Group 1, 64 months) and in the loss of MCyR/CHR
2916

group (Group 2, 67 months) compared with the loss of
CHR without prior MCyR group (Group 3, 79 months).
A smaller proportion of patients in the loss of MCyR
group (Group 1) had developed BCR-ABL mutations during imatinib treatment (44%) compared with the loss of
MCyR/CHR group (67%) and the loss of CHR group
(75%). No major differences were observed in the relative
frequencies of individual BCR-ABL mutations among the
3 groups.

Efficacy
After dasatinib treatment and after a median duration of
therapy with dasatinib of 13.8 months (range, 0.2-30.6
months), 90% of the total analysis group achieved a
CHR, 62% achieved an MCyR, and 51% achieved a
CCyR. The overall MMR rate was 40% among the
assessed patients from Study CA180-013 who were
included in the current analysis. Within each group, similar response rates were observed in patients who were

months (95% CI, 2.8-5.5 months) in Group 3. The majority of patients (80%-85%) who achieved a CCyR did
so within the first 6 months of treatment.

recruited to each of the 3 trials (Table 3). No obvious differences in responses were observed among patients who
received alternative dasatinib dosing regimens, although
the numbers were small in some cases. The proportion
of patients who achieved a CCyR with dasatinib after
loss of MCyR on imatinib (Group 1) was similar for
the patients who received 70 mg twice daily or 100 mg
once daily. In Groups 2 and 3, few patients were treated
with dasatinib 100 mg once daily, preventing any
comparison.
Among patients with loss of MCyR on imatinib
(Group 1; early intervention), 72% achieved a CCyR
with dasatinib treatment compared with 42% of patients
who were treated after loss of both MCyR and CHR
(Group 2; late intervention) (Table 3). Rates of MMR
(data from Study CA180-013 only) were 60% in Group 1
(n ¼ 47 evaluable patients) and 29% in Group 2 (n ¼ 17
evaluable patients). Among the patients who were treated
after loss of CHR and without prior MCyR to imatinib
(Group 3), 26% achieved a CCyR, and 26% achieved an
MMR (n ¼ 50 evaluable patients) (Table 3). The time to
CCyR among responding patients was similar in the 3
groups (Fig. 1). The median time to CCyR (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) among responding patients was
2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8-3.1 months) in Group 1, 4.2
months (95% CI, 2.8-5.8 months) in Group 2, and 3.2
Cancer

July 1, 2009

Across all 3 groups, the rates of CCyR did not appear to
be affected by the presence of pre-existing BCR-ABL
mutations, although patient numbers were relatively low
in some cases (Table 4). For patients with and without
any BCR-ABL mutation, the rates of CCyR were 77% versus 68% in Group 1 (loss of MCyR), respectively; 45%
versus 50% in Group 2 (loss of MCyR and CHR), respectively; and 25% versus 31% in Group 3 (loss of CHR
without prior MCyR). In Groups 1 and 3, similar CCyR
rates also were observed in patients with mutations within
the P-loop region compared with all patients in those
groups. In Group 2, the CCyR rate was lower in patients
with P-loop mutations, although the patient numbers
were small (n ¼ 7).
In the loss of MCyR group (Group 1) and the loss
of MCyR/CHR group (Group 2), MMR rates in evaluable patients with and without BCR-ABL mutations were
similar (Group 1: 62% vs 54%, respectively; Group 2:
31% vs 33%, respectively). In the loss of CHR without
prior MCyR group (Group 3), MMR rates appeared to be
lower in patients with BCR-ABL mutations versus patients
without mutations (24% vs 42%, respectively). Consistent with previous observations, no responses were
observed in patients who had a T315I mutation.

Event-free Survival, Transformation-free
Survival, and Overall Survival
Treatment with dasatinib after loss of MCyR (Group 1)
resulted in a lower rate of events (as defined above) compared with treatment after loss of both MCyR and CHR
(Group 2) (Fig. 2A). The rates of EFS at 24 months was
89% in Group 1 and 29% in Group 2. In Group 2, the
median EFS was 18.5 months (the median was not
reached in Group 1). Rates of TFS and OS at 24 months
were 98% (TFS) and 98% (OS) in Group 1, and 93%
(TFS) and 93% (OS) in Group 2.
Patients who received dasatinib after loss of CHR
without prior MCyR on imatinib (Group 3) had a lower

24-month EFS rate (64%) compared with patients who
were treated after loss of MCyR (Group 1) but a higher
rate compared with patients who were treated after loss of
both MCyR and CHR (Group 2). However, patients in
Group 3 had a lower 24-month TFS rate (79%) and OS
rate (86%) than patients in both Groups 1 and 2.

DISCUSSION
Dasatinib is an effective treatment for patients who have
experienced imatinib failure. The data in this analysis
demonstrate that response rates, EFS, TFS, and OS were
most favorable when dasatinib was administered early after imatinib failure, ie, after the loss of MCyR, rather than
after the loss of both MCyR and CHR. These observations are in line with what has been reported previously
for second-line treatment with imatinib after prior IFN
failure.10,11 It is noteworthy that responding patients
2918

from each group in this analysis appeared to achieve their
responses within a similar timeframe, as demonstrated by
the overlapping CIs for the median time to CCyR,
although this may have been caused in part to the smaller
sample size in Group 2. This suggests the possibility that
the improved outcomes with early intervention are not
explained by a more rapid time to response, which may be
prognostically favorable in CML.15 However, patients
who received earlier intervention with dasatinib in Group
1 had the highest rate of CCyR. Similar CCyR rates were
achieved by patients in this group who received dasatinib
70 mg twice daily or dasatinib 100 mg once daily.
In previous studies, BCR-ABL mutations have been
detected in 50% to 90% of patients with acquired resistance to imatinib.16-19 In the current analysis, patients who
had lost both MCyR and CHR on imatinib (Group 2) or
who had lost their CHR without prior MCyR (Group 3)
appeared to have a higher incidence of BCR-ABL

mutations compared with patients who had lost MCyR
only (Group 1). However, as reported previously,7,13 the
rates of CCyR with dasatinib therapy were similar in
patients with mutations and patients without mutations.
Differences between the groups also did not appear to
result from an increased incidence of patients with a
T315I mutation or other mutations that have been associated with relative dasatinib insensitivity. However, mutation data in this analysis should be interpreted with
caution given the relatively low number of patients, particularly in Group 2. In a report of patients with primary
cytogenetic resistance to imatinib, the development of
BCR-ABL mutations was associated with increased disease
progression and shorter survival,20 although no survival
difference was reported in an analysis that included
patients with other categories of imatinib resistance, possibly reflecting the effectiveness of second-generation BcrAbl inhibitors.21 Mutations can be detected several
months before hematologic or cytogenetic recurrence on
imatinib,19 and patients who develop mutations are at significantly increased risk of disease recurrence or progression.19-20,22,23 However, mutations also have been
detected in patients with stable cytogenetic remission.24,25
Patients who have a detectable BCR-ABL mutation during
imatinib treatment who have any sign of loss of response
or disease progression should receive second-line treatment at the earliest opportunity.
The results presented here suggest that the higher
level of insensitivity to dasatinib in Groups 2 and 3 compared with Group 1 is a result of resistance mechanisms
other than BCR-ABL mutations. Several other potential
mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been described,
including increased expression of the BCR-ABL gene
through gene amplification, decreased intracellular
imatinib concentrations resulting from plasma-binding
proteins, decreased drug influx, increased drug efflux,
decreased oral bioavailability, and activation of Src-family
kinases, such as Lyn.5,26,27 However, the high potency of
dasatinib compared with imatinib and the lesser impact of
transporters in dasatinib transport might be expected to
overcome these types of imatinib resistance. A more relevant mechanism may be clonal evolution (CE), ie, the acquisition of additional chromosomal abnormalities in Phpositive cells, which may lead to BCR-ABL independence.
CE has been detected at a frequency similar to BCR-ABL
mutation in patients with late CML-CP (after IFN) and

hematologic resistance to imatinib.28 In a separate analysis
in late CML-CP, CE was identified as an independent
adverse prognostic factor for hematologic recurrence (P <
.0001).29 During imatinib treatment, loss of MCyR indicates that imatinib no longer is providing effective inhibition of Bcr-Abl. Continuation of imatinib treatment until
loss of CHR may create the opportunity for leukemic
stem cells to accumulate additional genetic changes,
potentially leading to a greater likelihood of resistance to
all Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Data on the relative incidence of
CE before dasatinib were not available in the current analysis, and this would be an interesting area for future study.
It also is possible that other, unknown mechanisms of
resistance may be involved in differential responses to
dasatinib.
A proportion of patients who received dasatinib after loss of CHR without prior MCyR (Group 3)
achieved a CCyR or an MMR, although their rates were
lower than those in the other groups. Patients in Group
3 also had the lowest TFS and OS rates. The rate of EFS
in Group 3, which was higher than the rate in Group 2
(loss of both MCyR and CHR), may have been affected
by the definitions of events used in this analysis, particularly loss of MCyR. A much lower proportion of patients
in Group 3 achieved an MCyR and could subsequently
record loss of MCyR as an event, which may explain in
part the lack of correlation with EFS in these patients. It
is possible that patients within this group, who did not
achieve an MCyR with imatinib, had a disease biology
different from that in patients who did achieve a MCyR.
Further studies will be required to investigate characteristics among patients who have different types of primary
resistance to imatinib.
Overall, the results of the current analysis suggest
that patients who have lost their response to imatinib are
more likely to respond to dasatinib and to have prolonged
survival without disease progression if they receive early
intervention with dasatinib (at loss of MCyR). Regular
monitoring is essential during imatinib treatment to
determine when resistance first develops so that patients
can derive maximal benefit from alternative treatment.
