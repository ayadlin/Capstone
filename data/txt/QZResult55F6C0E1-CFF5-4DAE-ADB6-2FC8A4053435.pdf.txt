ABSTRACT:
In contrast to extensive studies on familial breast cancer, it is currently unclear
whether defects in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair genes play a role in
sporadic breast cancer development and progression. We performed analysis of
immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 235 were sporadic breast tumours.
This analysis suggested that RAD51 expression is increased during breast cancer
progression and metastasis and an oncogenic role for RAD51 when deregulated.
Subsequent knockdown of RAD51 repressed cancer cell migration in vitro and reduced
primary tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse model in vivo. Loss of RAD51 also
inhibited associated metastasis not only in syngeneic mice but human xenografts
and changed the metastatic gene expression profile of cancer cells, consistent with
inhibition of distant metastasis. This demonstrates for the first time a new function
of RAD51 that may underlie the proclivity of patients with RAD51 overexpression to
develop distant metastasis. RAD51 is a potential biomarker and attractive drug target
for metastatic triple negative breast cancer, with the capability to extend the survival
of patients, which is less than 6 months.

INTRODUCTION

We hypothesised that aberrant DNA damage response
(DDR) may drive and contribute to metastatic progression
of sporadic TNBC.
Much of the evidence linking defective DNA
damage response (DDR) with breast cancer susceptibility
comes through studies of familial breast cancer. Many
of the breast cancer predisposition genes identified
that mediate homologous recombination (HR) repair
of DNA damage, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, are
mutated or epigenetically silenced [1, 2]. However, no
inactivating mutations of RAD51, a crucial HR protein,

The molecular transformation of normal breast
epithelia to tumor requires the accumulation of a number
of mutations in key metabolic pathways. This is most
readily achieved by deregulation of cellular DNA repair
pathways, resulting in increased genomic instability. The
aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype
lacks expression of hormone receptors (ER, PR and
HER2) and therefore progression is determined by specific
molecu­lar aberrations critically important for cell survival.

have been reported in tumours. Paradoxically, Rad51 is
overexpressed in multiple tumor types, including breast
cancer [3]. Overexpression of RAD51 is due to increased
transcription, reduced methylation and/or stabilization
of the protein but not due to amplification of the RAD51
gene [4, 5]. Overexpression of RAD51 has also been
suggested as a driver of aberrant recombination, resulting
in excess DNA damage in precancerous cells. These drive
pathological recombination events such as chromosomal
amplifications, deletions and translocations resulting in
loss of heterozygosity and aneuploidy. These events can
lead to cancer development and progression to metastasis
[6, 7]. Cells that overexpress RAD51 exhibit disruption of
cell cycle, resistance to apoptotic signals and associated
resistance to DNA damaging agents (radiotherapy) and
chemotherapy [8-10]. Hence depletion of RAD51 by
siRNA and shRNA results in potential sensitization to
various agents as seen in radiation treatment of pancreatic
cancer and multiple myeloma [11], and in combination
therapies for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with
gemcitabine [12] and glioma with temozolomide [13].
However, despite these studies, the molecular mechanisms
of RAD51-mediated cancer progression have not been
fully elucidated.
We utilized in silico analysis of gene expression
datasets, clinical pathology and cellular biology studies
to show that one of the DNA repair genes RAD51 was
over represented in high grade and metastatic breast
carcinomas. We also utilized animal models to show
that RAD51 is required for metastasis and discovered
that RAD51 is a potential transcriptional co-factor of
c/EBPβ and supports metastatic expansion of cancer
cells via regulating changes in gene expression. These
are important discoveries for the development of new
therapeutic regimes and for successful treatment of
aggressive breast cancer, in particular metastases.

levels to be independent of both proliferation rate of
the cells (R2=0.0012, confirmed by contrasting RAD51
expression to S-phase regulated genes PCNA /Geminin)
and RAD51 functional status with varied formation of
foci in response to irradiation (Supplementary Figure
1A-C). To validate our cell line data, we proceeded to
evaluate RAD51 expression by immunohistochemistry
in an independent cohort of 235 were sporadic tumours
(Figure 1B). We found overall that 42/235 (17.8%) were
positive for nuclear RAD51. In the ILC cases with lymph
nodes metastases (LN mets), we found a significant
enrichment of nuclear RAD51 in metastatic compared to
the primary tumors (p=0.047, Figure 1B). Moreover, in 23
cases of matched in situ carcinoma, invasive carcinoma
and LN metastases from the same patients, RAD51 levels
increased with higher stage lesions (p=0.003, Figure
1B). We also investigated RAD51 expression in a series
of matched primary IDC and brain metastasis from the
same patients (n=39). Interestingly we observed a higher
frequency of positivity in these distant metastases (17/39,
43%) compared to the primary tumors (8/39, 20%), which
approached significance (p=0.0512, Figure 1C). We next
investigated RAD51 mRNA expression and correlation
with histopathological parameters in the METABRIC
(Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International
Consortium) dataset [18]. Fifty two percent of tumours had
high RAD51 mRNA expression, which was significantly
associated with aggressive clinicopathological features
(Supplementary Table 1), including diagnosis at younger
age, high histological grade, high proliferation index,
HER2-overexpression, absence of hormonal receptors
(ER/PR), presence of basal like phenotypes and triplenegative phenotypes (Supplementary Table 1). RAD51
expression was higher in tumors with TP53 mutation
and correlated with worse overall survival at 3 and 5
years (Supplementary Table 1). Overall in silico revealed
similar RAD51 expression trends to those observed with
cell lines and patient immunohistochemistry, consistent
with the notion that RAD51 expression is increased during
breast cancer progression and metastasis, suggesting
an oncogenic role when deregulated. Consistent with
previous work [3] our observations demonstrate RAD51
is more highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer when
compared to normal tissue.

RESULTS
RAD51 expression correlates with high-grade
metastatic breast tumors and poor prognosis
Increased RAD51 expression has been correlated
with poor clinical outcome in lung cancer, prostate cancer
and in ER+ breast cancer [14-17]. Comparison of breast
cancer cell lines revealed that RAD51 protein expression
was at two fold or higher in 9 of 12 (75%) triple negative
cell lines, 1 of 5 (20%) luminal and 2 of 3 (67%) HER2+
breast cancer cell lines when compared to the MCF10A
cell line (near normal mammary epithelial cell line
derived from a patient with benign fibrosarcoma)(Data
not shown). An example of the difference in expression
in triple negative breast cancer cell lines versus luminal is
shown in Figure 1A. Of note we found RAD51 expression

RAD51 knockdown affects metastasis in a
syngeneic tumor model in vivo
Next, we investigated the functional contribution
of RAD51 to primary tumour growth and metastasis
formation in vivo. using 4T1.2 cells, (a syngeneic mouse
mammary tumour model of spontaneous metastasis).
We engineered the 4T1.2 lines to express a doxycycline
regulated shRNA targeting Rad51. The pooled

by 70-80% (Fig 2A), with no change in cell growth with
RAD51 depleted cells doubling rate 32.3 hours versus SCR
control cells 28.6 hours (p=0.067) and viability compared
to cells transfected with a scrambled shRNA as a control
(Fig 2B). Both cell lines expressing the firefly luciferase
gene were orthotopically implanted into mammary fat
pads of immunocompetent mice to determine if RAD51
knockdown impacts on primary tumour growth and/or
metastasis. The depletion of RAD51 expression in 4T1.2
cells lead to a significant delay in primary tumor growth
in vivo (p=0.0013)(Fig 2C), with sustained depletion of
RAD51 at the primary site and overexpression observed in
metastatic tumours (Supplementary Figure 2). Luciferase
levels representing the presence of tumour cells in distant
organs were decreased in mice transplanted with shRAD51
4T1.2 cells as compared to shControl 4T1.2 cells (SCR) at
day 14 (Fig 2D), even when the luciferase activities were
normalized to the decreased primary tumor size observed
with shRAD51 4T1.2 cells. We hypothesize that the

observed delay in metastasis was due to poor seeding and
growth of the RAD51 depleted cancer cells at secondary
sites. To analyse whether RAD51 is required to support
metastatic cell growth we repeated the above experiment
after resection of same size primary tumours. As expected
from the above data, depletion of RAD51 expression
in the absence of the primary tumour inhibited onset
of metastatic lesions. After 14 days RAD51 depletion
resulted in regrowth of tumor at the original primary site
compared with control mice that displayed disseminated
metastatic tumours to the bone and brain (Figure 3A).
Overall tumour burden median was lower in the RAD51
depleted cohort compared to the control cohort (Figure
3B). This correlated with a significant increased survival
advantage for the RAD51 depleted cohort (p=0.025)
(Figure 3C).

depleted cells developed metastases compared with 89%
of the control mice. To gain mechanistic insights on the
role of RAD51 in promoting the colonization of secondary
sites, we focused on phenotypic changes induced by
knockdown of RAD51 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Metastatic
colonization of basal breast cancers can require reversion
from a mesenchymal to a more epithelial like phenotype
(MET transformation) and change in stem-ness promoting
migration and survival. After 7 days of knock-down of
RAD51 in MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed a change
in morphology in a sub-population of cells consistent
with a more epithelial, flattened shape and possible MET
via actin cytoskeletal rearrangement (Supplementary
Figure 3A). However there was no corresponding
change in expression of stem cell markers CD24/CD44

(Supplementary Figure 3B) and vimentin or E-cadherin
at the cell-cell junction (Supplementary Figure 3C) or
doubling rate (Supplementary Figure 3D). Taken together
these results suggest that RAD51 depletion is able to delay
colonization/ seeding at secondary sites, via a mechanism
that alters actin cytoskeleton with negligible impact on
mesenchymal phenotype/ stemness of the cells.
To confirm a role for RAD51 in breast cancer
metastasis in vivo, BT549 cells that had been engineered
to express firefly luciferase were transfected with RAD51
expression plasmid or empty vector (EV) (Figure 5A). The
gain of function increased the migration rate of the cell
line as measured by transwell assays (Figure 5B). Next
we assessed the degree of spontaneous liver metastasis by
orthotopic implantation. As previously observed, BT549

RAD51 is required for transcriptional activity of
c/EBPβ

established low level of spontaneous metastases in the
liver [19] and enhanced RAD51 expression resulted in
a significant increase in metastatic burden in the liver
compared to the control cohort (EV) (Figure 5C). This was
not observed in the spleen (Figure 5D vs 5E). Each cohort
of 10 mice was examined and 1 mouse in the control
cohort had vimentin positive macro-metastases while 6
mice in the Rad51 overexpressing cohort had vimentin
positive macro-metastases (Figure 5F). Taken together
these results indicate that RAD51 depletion suppressed
the metastatic spread of MDA-MB-231 cells and RAD51
overexpression enhanced the metastatic spread of BT549
cells, suggesting that RAD51 increases the metastatic
potential of breast cancer in vivo.

c/EBPβ is important for mammary gland
development and its expression is deregulated in breast
cancer [21]. RAD51 has previously been shown to act as a
co-factor for c/EBPβ and augment its ability to modulate
basal and Tat-induced activation of HIV-1 LTR [22]. We
confirm for the first time in breast cancer cells that RAD51
and c/EBPβ interact in situ (Figure 6A) and confirmed
this by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins
(Figure 6B). RAD51 expression levels also determines c/
EBPβ transcriptional activity with up to 80% reduction
in activity observed with depletion of RAD51 using
two differently targeting RNAi constructs (p=2.8x10-9)
(Fig 6C). To confirm RAD51 associated changes in
expression of c/EBPβ target genes we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of c/EBPβ at the
target genes identified in array in MDA-MB-231 cells
with or without knockdown of RAD51. After depletion
of RAD51 there was a reduction in the enrichment of
c/EBPβ at the promoter of MMP11, MMP13, TGFβ
and SMAD2 (Supplementary Figure 6). Interestingly,
targeting of RAD51 by two different siRNAs directed
against different regions of RAD51 lead to an associated
downregulation of c/EBPβ protein (Fig 6D). We also
observed co-regulation of expression with some reduced
mRNA expression of c/EBPβ after depletion of RAD51
(Fig 6E). This suggests that RAD51 and c/EBPβ exist
as a part of complex wherein RAD51 likely controls c/
EBPβ transcription affecting metastatic gene expression
levels and the pro-metastatic cell phenotype profile. The
molecular mechanism by which this occurs represents a
new function for a DNA damage response protein and is
part of ongoing research.

RAD51 regulates metastatic gene expression as a
possible transcriptional co-factor
The change in cell morphology of sub-population of
RAD51-depleted cells, motivated us to determine whether
RAD51 expression level affects metastasis via changes in
both migration potential and gene expression; including
cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, proliferation and/
or transcription factor genes. Knockdown of RAD51 in
MDA-MB-231 cells impeded migration (Supplementary
Figure 3A), while overexpression in Hs578t cells enhanced
migration (Supplementary Figure 3B). We also observed
increased expression of c/EBPβ in both Hs578t and BT549
cells overexpressing RAD51 (Supplementary Figure 4).
Next we performed a metastasis specific gene expression
array on the same cell lines. A total of 82 genes previously
implicated in processes relevant to tumor progression
were screened, of which 25 were selectively induced with
overexpression of RAD51 and repressed with knockdown
of RAD51 (Supplementary Fig 5C). In particular, reduced
RAD51 expression correlated with increased expression
of genes that inhibit metastatic invasion, including; CCL7,
BRMS1, NME4 and TIMP3, and a corresponding decrease
in expression of genes promoting metastatic invasion and
proliferation; MMP13, MMP11, MMP10, MMP3, MMP7,
MTA1, IL1β, TCF20, and oncogenes H-RAS, K-RAS,
MDM2 and the mutated form of TP53. Four (namely,
MMP2, MET, NF2 and TP53) of the 25 identified genes
are expressed in aggressive lung metastases from breast
cancer [20]. We also confirmed upregulation of 8 of the
25 genes in BT549 cell line overexpressing RAD51 that
showed enhanced metastatic spread to the liver in mice.
We also determined that 5 (MMP11, MMP13, SMAD2
TGFβ, TP53) of the 25 are regulated by the transcription
factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (c/EBPβ)
when further analysed for transcription factor binding
motifs using Ingenuity analysis.

DISCUSSION
Although DNA repair proteins are considered
fundamental to the development of breast cancer,
their contribution in pathogenesis of sporadic breast
cancer remains an understudied area. Using cell line,
immunohistochemistry, in silico and animal model analysis
we find that high RAD51 expression correlates with
aggressive breast cancer and its loss retards metastasis. We
also observed high RAD51 expression in conjunction with
p53 mutation or loss. This provides an additional driver of
mutation and a likely mechanism for overexpression via
loss of p53-mediated repression of RAD51 at the RAD51
promoter [9, 23]. RAD51 also contains FoxM1 binding
sites in its promoter and its expression can be regulated
in glioblastoma by this transcription factor [24]. Although
RAD51 also contains promoter-binding sites for c/EBPβ,
it is currently not known to regulate RAD51 expression
in the cancer setting. Interestingly c/EBPβ can repress

p53 expression [25] suggesting a possible mechanism for
RAD51 overexpression. Thus, the mechanism of increased
transcriptional upregulation of RAD51 in cancers has
not been fully defined but it is unlikely to involve gene
amplifications or fusions [26]. Using breast tissues TMA,
we confirmed that high level of RAD51 correlates with
advanced histological grading in breast cancer, consistent
with a previous report [3].. Notably, RAD51 is highly
expressed in matched lymph node and brain metastasis
compared to primary tumor. Overall, these data indicate
that RAD51 overexpression might have significant impact
on progression and metastasis of breast cancer.
Overexpresison of DNA damage response genes
are known to support cancer [9]. However DNA damage
proteins have not previously been strongly linked with

metastatic progression. We show that RAD51 is crucial
not only for primary tumor growth but also metastatic
spread of 4T1.2 cells. Using tail vein assay of cancer
metastasis in MDA-MB231 cells, we show that RAD51
dramatically promotes appearance of lung metastasis.
Notably, these results cannot be explained by effect of
RAD51 on cell growth, as RAD51 depletion did not effect
cell proliferation and doubling time in vitro and primary
tumor growth in vivo in MDA-MB231 xenografts.
Strikingly, overexpression of RAD51 in BT549 cells
significantly increased spontaneous metastasis to liver.
The data presented here constitute the first direct evidence
of the role of RAD51 promoting or enhancing metastastic
progression.
Consistent with changes in metastatic potential,

(p<0.0001). (D) Western blot analysis of protein expression levels using RNAi directed towards both c/EBP and RAD51 was performed

we found that RAD51 increases the expression of
prometastatic genes and reduces the expression of
metastasis suppressor genes. Amongst these were several
c/EBPβ target genes. We further demonstrated that RAD51
and c/EBPβ exist as part of a complex wherein RAD51
controls c/EBPβ transcription. Consistent with this c/
EBPβ binding at its target genes and transactivation of
c/EBPβ reporter was reduced in RAD51 depleted cells.
Our array also defined target genes of c/EBPβ (regulated
by RAD51 expression) that are required for invasion.
Stromal cells largely express MMPs, however we find
distinct changes in their expression in breast cancer
cell lines. It is suggested that cancer cell lines that have
already undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such
as triple negative breast cancer cells up regulate MMPs
as part of promoting cell motility, leading to migration
from the primary tumour and intravasation [27]. This has
also been observed in xenografts of human breast cancer
cell lines [28]. We find that both MMP11 and MMP13
levels are regulated by RAD51 expression. MMP13 is
upregulated in metastatic breast cancer patient samples
[29] and is part of a gene signature that is a predictor of
prognosis in breast cancer lymph node metastasis [30].
Thus it appears that RAD51 has two distinct
roles in promoting metastasis; the first is based on the
increased repair and stabilizing the cancer genome
allowing spread of tumor cells [8, 9] and the second as
a regulator of c/EBPβ in promoting pro-metastatic gene
expression. The stabilization of the cancer genome
means that deregulated RAD51 is promoting aberrant
DNA repair that allows advantageous mutations beyond
those required for primary tumors. For example ectopic
overexpression of RAD51 protein in mouse embryonic
stem cells leads to a novel spectrum of recombination
events, including multiple chromosome rearrangements
and aneuploidy [7]. The second role regulates metastasis,
via modulation of gene expression as a cofactor for c/
EBPβ. c/EBPβ transcriptional activity is determined by
the levels of isoforms LAP1, LAP2 and LIP. LIP forms
suppressive heterodimers with the other isoforms. c/
EBPβ has been associated with hematopoietic and
adipocyte differentiation [31, 32] and implicated as an
essential mediator of mammary gland development[33].
Therefore we can assume that c/EBPβ is able to regulate
gene expression in breast tissue resulting in growth
and differentiation. Indeed in the breast cancer setting,
deregulation of LIP function contributes to escape of
cytostatic effects of TGFβ and contributes to tumour
metastasis [33-36]. We observe that RAD51 is strongly
associated with breast cancer pathology progression, highgrade tumours and metastasis. The combination of RAD51
contributing to enhancing c/EBPβ expression efficiency
is undeniably a potent combination in driving metastatic
progression. Supporting this hypothesis is the number
of oncogenes and tumour suppressors (H-RAS, KRAS,
c-MYC, TP53) revealed in our array that are regulated in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to RAD51 expression levels.
The role of transcriptional co-factor, a regulator
of metastatic gene profiles makes RAD51 a possible
biomarker and new therapeutic target. RAD51 has been
suggested as possible biomarker to predict sensitivity to
PARP1 inhibitor treatment and potential predictor for
metastatic survival [37, 38]. We believe our findings have
clinical implications for treating aggressive metastatic
triple negative breast cancer and other cancers that have
acquired overexpression of RAD51 and is the focus of
ongoing work.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor
blocks were retrieved from the archives of the Royal
Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (Australia), Sullivan and
Nicholades Pathology (Australia), various sources outlined
previously[39] and the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation
Consortium for research into Familial Breast Cancer
(kConFab, Australia). There were several sets of samples
analyzed, outlined in Table 1, including primary breast
cancers and metastases on tissue microarrays (TMA):
sporadic primary tumors (n=235), familial primary tumors
(n=560), lymph node (LN) metastases (n=28), matched
primary and brain metastases (n=39). For these cases the
immunohistochemistry data for ER, PR and HER2 were
available. We also analyzed 23 cases on whole sections,
in which multiple stages of progression were analyzed: in
situ carcinoma, invasive carcinoma, LN metastasis. The
use of tumor samples was approved by the local research
ethics committees.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on
TMA sections, whole tissue sections and resected murine
tumors to evaluate RAD51 protein expression in breast
cancer. Sections were cut at 4 µm, mounted on silanecoated slides and subjected to antigenic retrieval in EDTA
[pH 8.0] for 2 minutes at 105oC. IHC was done using
the anti-RAD51 primary antibody (SC 8349, Santa Cruz
Biotech; 1:40 dilution, 2 hours incubation at 37C) and the
MACH 2™ Polymer Detection system according to the
manufacturer’s (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA).
Staining was visualized with 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine
(DAB) and a haematoxylin counterstain. Germinal
centre lymphocytes in normal lymph nodes served
as a positive staining control for RAD51 due to the
high rate of DNA repair associated immunoglobulin
expression rearrangements. The staining was assessed
semi-quantitatively by analysis of RAD51 positive cells

with nuclear staining of RAD51 rather than cytoplasmic
considered positive, with additional arbitrary thresholds of
intensity of staining, compared to positive controls.

doxycycline water 4 µg/ml to induce knockdown. Noninduced and empty vector (EV) cohorts served as controls.
Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurement and
visualized using luciferase-mediated live animal imaging
with the IVIS100 Xenogen system (Caliper Life Sciences).

Cell culture, transfections and generation of
inducible RAD51 knockdown and overexpression
of RAD51 in cells

In-vivo metastatic seeding
Female nude mice NU-Foxn1nu (5 weeks old) were
injected intravenously with 1x106 doxycycline induced
MDA-MB-231-RAD51mir or MDA-MB-231-SCRmir
cells. Seeding of the lungs was visualized using luciferasemediated live animal imaging and monitored weekly for
establishment of tumors. Mice remained on doxycycline
water for the duration of the experiment.

Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT549,
Hs578t and the murine 4T1.2 were grown in DMEM media
supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum. All cell lines
except 4T1.2 identity was confirmed by short tandem
repeat (STR) profiling. Stealth siRNA (RAD51.1 and
RAD51.2) and control siRNA oligos were purchased from
Invitrogen. siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions and
samples were analyzed 48 hrs after transfection. Stable
inducible knockdown cells were generated by integration
of RAD51-mir (5’-CTCGGTACTGTGTTGTTCGTTA-3’)
and
scrambled-mir
(5’-GTGTAACACGTCTATACGCCCA-3’) constructs
into TMP-IRES-GFP vector and transfected into MDAMB-231 and 4T1.2 cell as described previously by
Dickins et al.[40]. Overexpression was performed using
Origene precision shuttle mammalian vector with full
length human RAD51 and c-terminal tGFP tag and
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were purified based on
GFP expression.

Migration studies
3x104 cells were seeded in Xcelligence 16 well CIMtranswell plate without serum (Roche) and monitored for
20 -36 hours for migration towards a 20% serum gradient.

Metastatic gene expression Array
RNA was isolated from 5 µg/ml doxycycline
induced and non-induced MDA-MB-231-RAD51mir or
MDA-MB-231-SCRmir cells and Hs578T-EV (empty
vector) and Hs578T-RAD51GFP using QIAGEN
RNAEasy Mini Kit (Cat 74104). cDNA was synthesized
using RT2 First Strand Kit (QIAGEN Cat 330401). cDNA
was loaded in duplicate on The Human Tumor Metastasis
RT² Profiler™ PCR Array containing 82 genes (QIAGENCat PAHS-028G-4) and analyzed on Roche Lightcycler
480. Fold expression change was calculated against actin
and expressed as base-two exponential increase in RNA
levels (2ΔΔCt)+/- SEM.

Immunoblotting
Protein lysates were prepared via whole cell lysis
in ice-cold lysis buffer (150mM NaCl, 10mM Tris-Cl
pH 7.4, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented
with protease inhibitors (Leupeptin, Pepstatin and PMSF,
Sigma Aldridge). Immunoblots were probed with antiRAD51 (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-PARP (Millipore), antiPAR (BD Biosceinces), DNA-PK;P2609 (Cell Signaling)
and anti-53BP1 (Bethyl), and with anti-Tubulin (Sigma)
and anti-ß-Actin, (Sigma) as controls. Membranes were
developed using fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies
and visualized using the Odyssey system. Protein
expression levels were determined by optical density
versus actin loading controls using Image J software
(NIH).

Statistical methods
Statistical assessment of immunohistochemistry
data was performed in GraphPad Prism V5.0c using
Chi squared test with Yates correction (95% confidence
interval) and Fisher’s exact test to compare RAD51 status
between defined subgroups of samples. Significance of
biological experiments was assessed with student t-tests
(two tailed) +/-SEM.
