ABSTRACT
The anti-HER2 antibody pertuzumab inhibits HER2 dimerization and affects HER2/
HER3 dimer formation and signaling. As HER3 and its ligand neuregulin are implicated
in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we investigated whether HER3 expression could be a
predictive biomarker of pertuzumab efficacy in HER2low-expressing pancreatic cancer.
We correlated in vitro and in vivo HER3 expression and neuregulin dependency with
the inhibitory effect of pertuzumab on cell viability and tumor progression. HER3
knockdown in BxPC-3 cells led to resistance to pertuzumab therapy. Pertuzumab
treatment of HER3-expressing pancreatic cancer cells increased HER3 at the cell
membrane, whereas the anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody 9F7-F11 down-regulated
it. Both antibodies blocked HER3 and AKT phosphorylation and inhibited HER2/
HER3 heterodimerization but affected differently HER2 and HER3 homodimers. The
pertuzumab/9F7-F11 combination enhanced tumor inhibition and the median survival
time in mice xenografted with HER3-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, HER2
and HER3 were co-expressed in 11% and HER3 alone in 27% of the 45 pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas analyzed by immunohistochemistry. HER3 is essential for
pertuzumab efficacy in HER2low-expressing pancreatic cancer and HER3 expression
might be a predictive biomarker of pertuzumab efficacy in such cancers. Further
studies in clinical samples are required to confirm these findings and the interest of
combining anti-HER2 and anti-HER3 therapeutic antibodies.

INTRODUCTION

[1], only palliative therapy is possible and the 5-year
survival rate is lower than 5% [2]. In an effort to find
new treatments, the molecular mechanisms involved in
pancreatic cancer development are currently investigated
and EGFR family members [3] have emerged as relevant

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most
aggressive tumors. As at diagnosis 60 to 80% of patients
already have locally advanced or metastatic disease

and promising therapeutic targets. The significant, but
modest, increase in median survival obtained with the
erlotinib/gemcitabine combination illustrates the potential
and the challenges of anti-EGFR therapies in pancreatic
cancer [4]. Moreover, a better selection of the patients who
could benefit from these novel therapies could improve
their efficacy and the prognosis, as demonstrated for the
anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab in breast cancers. Indeed,
trastuzumab blocks the growth of breast tumors that
strongly express HER2 or with HER2 gene amplification,
but is not efficient in cancers with normal or low HER2
protein level. It is critical to emphasize that trastuzumab
therapeutic activity could have been underestimated by
testing it in patients who had not been selected based on
their HER2 status [5].
We have recently demonstrated the interest
of targeting EGFR/HER2 heterodimers in HER2lowexpressing pancreatic cancer [6]. The combination of
cetuximab and trastuzumab had a synergistic anti-tumor
effect that was mainly due to the modification of the
distribution of homo- and hetero-dimers, with disruption
of EGFR/HER2 dimers and increased homodimer
formation. To date the only HER2-targeting drug
known to disturb ligand-activated HER2 dimerization
is pertuzumab. This antibody binds to a different HER2
epitope than trastuzumab and thereby has a therapeutic
effect in preclinical studies that does not strictly require
HER2 protein overexpression [8]. Nevertheless,
pertuzumab was recently approved, in combination with
trastuzumab and docetaxel, only for the treatment of
HER2-positive (HER2high) metastatic breast cancer [9].
Moreover, pertuzumab inhibits neuregulin-stimulated cell
growth mediated by HER2/HER3 dimers in breast cancer,
whereas trastuzumab is more efficient in the absence of
neuregulin [8]. These two antibodies seem to regulate
differently HER2 homo- and hetero-dimers and to have
different ligand dependencies.
HER3 is the main HER2 partner involved in
pertuzumab response in ovarian cancer [10], but it could
also influence pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis [11]
because it is often overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and
HER3 high expression correlates with advanced disease
stages and lower overall survival [12, 13]. Although HER3
has a very weak intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, its
neuregulin-triggered transactivation by other members of
the EGFR family induces direct phosphorylation of the
six binding sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K,
resulting in activation of the AKT signaling cascade [14].
Furthermore, HER3 is a key player in tumor cell resistance
to EGFR- and HER2-targeted therapies, particularly
in pancreatic cancer where it regulates EGFR signaling
by modulating the response to erlotinib or cetuximab
[13]. HER3-mediated AKT signaling participates also in
gemcitabine resistance [15]. In HER2-amplified breast
tumors, resistance to trastuzumab or to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors has been associated with HER3 expression [15].

In this study, we investigated whether HER3
expression could affect the therapeutic response to
pertuzumab in HER2low pancreatic cancer by analyzing
in vitro and in vivo pertuzumab effects in HER2low
pancreatic cancer cell lines that express or not HER3.
We show that the inhibitory effect of pertuzumab on
cell viability and tumor progression in pancreatic cancer
xenografts correlates with HER3 protein expression and
is neuregulin-dependent. Accordingly, HER3 knockdown
led to resistance to pertuzumab therapy. We also found
that HER3 mRNA level and cell surface expression were
increased after pertuzumab treatment. Based on these
results we tested the effects of combining pertuzumab
with the anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody 9F7-F11
[17]. The combined treatment enhanced tumor growth
inhibition in pancreatic cancer xenografts, suggesting that
it might represent a new potential therapy for pancreatic
cancers that co-express HER2 and HER3. Finally, we
analyzed the co-expression of HER2 and HER3 by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 45 pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinomas (PDAC).

RESULTS
HER3 expression and NRG1β1-induced
proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells
The expression of HER family members and
NRG1β1-induced proliferation was assessed in five
pancreatic cancer cell lines that harbor KRAS mutations
and in one cell line (BxPC-3) wild type. All of them were
wild type PTEN/PIK3CA. These data are consistent with
patterns described in pancreatic tumors (supplementary
Table 1). Flow cytometry showed that HER3 was
expressed in CFPAC-1, HPAC and BxPC-3, but not in
Capan-1, MiaPaCa-2 and PancPec cells. Comparably
moderate HER2 and higher EGFR levels were observed
in all cell lines (Figure1A). HER4 expression could not be
detected in the six cell lines [data not shown]. Incubation
with NRG1β1 induced cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner only in the HER3-positive (BxPC-3,
CFPAC-1 and HPAC) cell lines (Figure 1B). However, the
finding that NRG1β1 effect was highest in CFPAC-1 cells,
which had the lowest HER3 expression level, indicates
that it is independent of the HER3 membrane expression
level.

Pertuzumab inhibits growth of HER3-positive
pancreatic tumors both in vitro and in vivo
We then investigated the ability of pertuzumab to
inhibit the growth of the six pancreatic cancer cell lines
after stimulation, or not, by NRG1β1. In the absence
of ligand stimulation, pertuzumab reduced the growth
7139

of the HER3-positive cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner [between 10% and 35%], but did not affect the

viability of the HER3-negative cell lines (Figure 2A).
Pertuzumab growth inhibition of the HER3-positive
pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 was significantly
increased following stimulation with NRG1β1 (60%
inhibition with neuregulin stimulation versus 35% without
it) (Figure 2B). Conversely, no NRG1β1 effect was
observed in HER3-negative Capan-1 cells (Figure 2B).
These results demonstrate that pertuzumab is efficient in
HER3-positive pancreatic cancer cells independently
of NRG1β1 stimulation; however, neuregulin signaling
through HER3 potentiates its inhibitory effect on
pancreatic cell growth.
We evaluated the effect of pertuzumab on growth of
tumors obtained by xenografting the six pancreatic cancer
cell lines. The volume of HER3-positive tumor xenografts
was significantly smaller in mice treated with 2 or 10 mg/
kg pertuzumab than in animals treated with vehicle alone
(controls) (p=0.0052 for HPAC; p=0.0269 for CFPAC-1;
p<0.001 for BxPC-3 cells) (Figure 2C). No significant
difference was observed between the 2 and 10 mg/kg
regimens in the three models, suggesting that 2 mg/kg is
sufficient to saturate the low HER2 receptor expression.
In contrast, pertuzumab had almost no effect on growth
of tumors derived from HER3-negative pancreatic cancer
cells, demonstrating that pertuzumab is efficient in vivo
only in HER3-positive pancreatic tumor xenografts.

line in which HER3 expression was abrogated by stable
knockdown of HER3 by shRNA (shHER3 BxPC-3).
BxPC-3 cells that stably express the pSIREN-shLuc vector
alone were used as negative control (shCTRL BxPC-3).
HER2 expression was not affected and was similar in both
cell lines (Figure 3A). The dose-dependent positive effect
of NRG1β1 on cell proliferation observed in parental
BxPC-3 cells was inhibited in shHER3 BxPC-3 cells, but
not in shCTRL BxPC-3 cells (Figure 3B). Treatment with
1 µg/ml pertuzumab significantly inhibited proliferation
of NRG1β1-stimulated shCTRL BxPC-3 cells and their

viability was reduced by 45% after 5 days (Figure 3C).
Conversely, pertuzumab had no significant effect on
shHER3 BxPC-3 cell growth (Figure 3C), demonstrating
that HER3 knockdown in vitro induces resistance to
pertuzumab therapy in pancreatic cancer cells.
To confirm the relationship between HER3
expression and pertuzumab therapeutic efficacy in vivo,
mice were grafted with shHER3 or shCTRL BxPC-3
cells (Figure 3D-E). Pertuzumab significantly inhibited
the growth of shCTRL BxPC-3 tumor xenografts and
increased animal survival in comparison to untreated
controls (p<0.0001 and p=0.0015) (Figure 3D).
Conversely, only a slight inhibition of tumor growth
(possibly due to activation of immune cells through
ADCC or inhibition of HER2/HER1 heterodimers by
pertuzumab) and no significant increase in survival were
observed in mice xenografted with shHER3 BxPC-3
cancer cells and treated with pertuzumab in comparison to
untreated controls (p=0.002; p=0.086) (Figure 3E). At the
end of the experiment, HER3 expression was still downregulated in shHER3 BxPC-3 tumor xenografts isolated
from treated mice. These results indicate that BxPC-3
cell proliferation in vivo is partly HER3-dependent and
that HER3 knockdown in vivo abrogates pertuzumab
therapeutic efficacy.

Pertuzumab treatment induced an increase in
HER3 expression
HER3 expression after pertuzumab treatment was
studied in NRG1β1-stimulated BxPC-3 cells (Figure 4).
Pertuzumab did not affect HER3 protein level during the
first hours of treatment but a slight increase was observed
after 24h compared with untreated cells (Figure 4A). By
qPCR analysis, an increase in HER3 mRNA was observed
after 4 hours of pertuzumab treatment (Figure 4B), leading
to an increase in HER3 expression at the cell surface after
24 hours (Figure 4C). These results demonstrate the ability
of pertuzumab to increase HER3 expression.

anti-HER3 antibody 9F7-F11 enhances growth
inhibition of pancreatic cancer xenografts

Based on the finding that pertuzumab increases
HER3 expression, we compared the effect of the antiHER3 mAb 9F7-F11 and of pertuzumab, which targets
HER3 indirectly (Figure 4D), on BxPC-3 tumor xenograft
growth. Both antibodies markedly slowed down tumor
growth compared with the untreated group (p<0.001)
and no significant difference was observed between
antibodies (p=0.6488) (Figure 4D). The median survival
was significantly delayed by 17 days in mice treated with
9F7-F11 and by 23 days in mice treated with pertuzumab
in comparison to controls (Figure 4E).

Co-treatment with 9F7-F11 and pertuzumab
inhibited tumor growth much more than each antibody
alone (pertuzumab alone versus pertuzumab+9F7-F11
p=0.004). At the end of the 4-week treatment, tumor
volume kept increasing in mice treated with pertuzumab or
9F7-F11 alone, whereas it remained quite stable in animals
that received the pertuzumab+9F7-F11 combination.
Median survival was longer in animals treated with the
two-antibody combination than in control animals [gain
of 41 days; p=0.0001] or in mice that received a single
antibody (pertuzumab+9F7-F11 vs 9F7-F11 p=0.0013;
pertuzumab+9F7-F11 vs pertuzumab p=0.0355).

comparison to untreated cells. Conversely, it increased
HER2 phosphorylation even after 24h of treatment
and completely abrogated HER3, AKT and ERK1/2
phosphorylation. These results were confirmed in vivo in
BxPC-3 tumor xenografts isolated from antibody-treated
and control mice (Supplementary Figure. 1).
We then investigated the effect on BxPC-3 cells of
direct HER3 targeting by 9F7-F11 and stimulation with
NRG1β1 (Figure 5B). 9F7-F11 did not affect HER2
expression, but inhibited HER2 phosphorylation during
the first 60 min of treatment. HER3 was significantly
down-regulated after 24h of treatment and phosphorylation
of HER3, AKT and ERK 1/2 was strongly reduced already
after 15 min of treatment.
The pertuzumab+9F7-F11 combination had no effect
on HER2 expression, but increased HER2 phosphorylation
(Figure 5C), like with pertuzumab alone (Figure 5A).
After 15 minutes of dual antibody treatment, as observed
with 9F7-F11, HER3 was significantly down-regulated
and HER3, AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibited.

Pertuzumab and 9F7-F11 differentially affect
HER2 and HER3 and downstream signaling
pathways in pancreatic cancer cells
To assess the mechanisms underlying the role of
HER3 in pancreatic cancer response to pertuzumab,
HER2/HER3
expression,
phosphorylation
and
downstream signaling were studied in NRG1β1-stimulated
BxPC-3 cells after pertuzumab addition (Figure 5A). As
expected, NRG1β1 stimulation induced phosphorylation
of HER2 and HER3 and of the downstream signaling
molecules ERK1/2 and AKT. Pertuzumab did not affect
HER2 and HER3 expression during the first hour of
treatment and only slightly after 24h of treatment in

Pertuzumab blocks HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and HER2 homo-dimerization
without affecting HER3 homodimers
Using a recently described antibody-based TRFRET assay [8], we analyzed the effects of pertuzumab

Figure 4: Effect of pertuzumab on HER3 protein (A) and mRNA (B) expression. BxPC-3 cells were pre-incubated with

pertuzumab (50 µg/ml) and then with 100 ng/ml NRG1ß1 for 10 minutes. The total level of HER3 was then analyzed by western blotting
(A). HER3 mRNA was quantified by q-PCR, normalized to a housekeeping gene and expressed relatively to neuregulin-treated cells (B.

pertuzumab+9F7-F11 [anti-HER3 antibody] combination increases tumor growth inhibition in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell xenografts

twice per week]. Results are presented as the mean tumor volume of each group (D) and as Kaplan-Meyer survival curves (E) (% of mice

and/or 9F7-F11 on HER2/HER3 dimerization in HER2/
HER3 transfected fibroblasts. This cell line was chosen
because it expresses at least ten-fold more HER2 and
HER3 receptors than the pancreatic cancer cell lines
and thus allows obtaining a better fluorescence signal to
accurately investigate dimer formation. In comparison
to untreated cells, incubation with pertuzumab led to a
significant (50%) decrease of HER2/HER3 heterodimers
(p<0.001)(Figure 5D). Incubation with the 9F7-F11
antibody also reduced the percentage of HER2/HER3
heterodimers, but to a lesser extent (25 %, p<0.001).
Co-incubation with pertuzumab and 9F7-F11 was the
most effective with a 64 % decrease in HER2/HER3
dimer concentration (p<0.001). Pertuzumab, but not
9F7-F11, decreased HER2 homodimers (Figure 5E).
Conversely, 9F7-F11, but not pertuzumab, increased the
percentage of HER3 homodimers (Figure 5F), possibly
because 9F7-F11 could bring two receptor molecules in
proximity. The antibody combination also increased HER3
homodimer concentration, an effect probably due to 9F7F11. Incubation with NRG1β1 increased the percentage

of HER2/HER3 heterodimers and HER3 “proximers” (at
high doses), while it decreased the percentage of HER2
homodimers.

Immunohistochemistry detection of HER2/HER3
co-expression in human PDAC
Finally, we investigated whether HER2 and HER3
are co-expressed in PDAC specimens from 45 patients
by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2 was detected by
IHC in 10/45 PDAC specimens (22%). HER2 expression
was moderate in two of them and weak in the others
(Figure 6). HER3 was detected in 12/44 PDAC (27%). In
all cases, staining was weak but clearly positive. HER2/
HER3 co-expression was observed in 5/44 PDAC (11%);
specifically, 42% of the HER3-positive PDAC samples
were also HER2-positive. HER2 and HER3 were mainly
detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 6C and D) and weak
membrane expression was observed in several specimens.

DISCUSSION

responses than HER2 homodimers. Thus, ligandinduced activation of EGFR or HER3 and formation of
heterodimers with HER2 may play an important role in
tumor growth and resistance to therapy. Inhibition of
HER2/HER3 dimerization could represent a rational
approach to anticancer therapy where HER3-mediated
signaling plays a role in tumorigenesis. Pertuzumab is the
first in a new class of drugs known as HER dimerization
inhibitors and has already been tested in preclinical models
of breast, prostate, lung, ovarian and colon cancers.
Although most of these works reported that pertuzumab
is efficient in HER2 over-expressing cancer cells, some
found that it can inhibit tumor growth independently of
HER2 protein expression level [21]. In a phase I clinical
trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of
pertuzumab in patients with incurable, locally advanced,
recurrent or metastatic solid malignancies, clinical efficacy
was observed in two patients with advanced pancreatic
and ovarian cancer that did not overexpress HER2 [22].
A phase II trial on pertuzumab in refractory ovarian
cancers showed an increase in the median progressionfree survival in patients with HER2-activated tumors
compared to the group with HER2-inactivated cancers,
independently of the HER2 overexpression status [23].
Our pre-clinical results corroborate these findings
and suggest that HER dimerization inhibition might
represent a novel clinical approach for pancreatic
cancer treatment. Indeed, although HER2 expression
was comparably low [approximately 15 000 receptors/
cell] in the six pancreatic cancer cell lines used in this
study, pertuzumab inhibited cell proliferation only
in HER3-positive cells, probably through blockade
of ligand-induced HER2/HER3 dimers. Pertuzumab
efficacy in pancreatic cancer cells was greatly increased
when exogenous NRG1 was added as stimulator, thus

Our results demonstrate that HER3 is essential for
pertuzumab efficacy in HER2low-expressing pancreatic
tumor xenografts and suggest that the combination of
this antibody with an anti-HER3 antibody could be a
new potential treatment for pancreatic cancers that coexpress HER2 and HER3. In our cohort of patients with
PDAC, 11% of tumors co-expressed HER2 and HER3.
However, the IHC method used for HER2 detection was
optimized and validated only for breast and stomach
cancer, thus it may not be sensitive enough to detect
weak HER2 expression in PDAC. Consequently, we
could have underestimated the number of patients with
HER2-positive PDAC. Indeed, the pancreatic cancer
cell lines BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2 and Capan-1, which were
classified as HER2-negative using the HercepTest (Dako)
[6], showed moderate HER2 expression by using a more
sensitive flow cytometry technique (Figure 1). Moreover,
the finding that growth of mouse xenografts derived
from such HER2low cell lines was efficiently reduced by
pertuzumab (Figure 3) suggests that pertuzumab could be
effective in a wider population of patients with PDAC that
have lower HER2 expression level than the one used to
select eligible patients for trastuzumab therapy based on
the Herceptest or Pathway HER2 assays. The development
of a suitable method for evaluating HER2 expression in
PDAC is a current project of our group.
Dimerization is essential for the activity of HER
family members and plays a major role in driving the
growth of several cancers [20]. As HER2 extracellular
domain is always in the active conformation, HER2 is
ready to interact with other ligand-activated HER partners.
In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that
HER2-containing heterodimers elicit greater mitogenic

demonstrating that ligand-induced HER2/HER3 dimers
strongly affect the fate of pancreatic tumor cells. The
importance of HER2/HER3 dimers is strengthened by the
high EGFR expression in the six cell lines. This finding
indicates that, besides the role of EGFR/HER3 and HER2/
EGFR dimers [13], also HER2/HER3 dimers are major
drivers of tumorigenesis in HER2low pancreatic cancer.
A short treatment (15 min) of BxPC-3 pancreatic
cancer cells with pertuzumab was sufficient to abrogate
HER3 and AKT phosphorylation, whereas no effect was
observed on HER2 phosphorylation. This suggests that
pertuzumab has an indirect effect on HER3, possibly
through disruption of HER2/HER3 dimers and the
consequent inhibition of HER3 activation and induction
of HER3 stabilization at the cell surface. Treatment with
pertuzumab (24 h) led to HER3 protein increase, which
could be involved in bypassing the pertuzumab-induced
HER2 inhibition, as observed by Garrett et al [24] in breast
cancer cells treated with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, and
by Nagumo et al [25] in ovarian cancer cells and breast
cancer xenografts treated with pertuzumab.
HER3 seems to fine-tune the anti-tumor drug
response [26] and thus could be used as a biomarker to
select patients who might benefit from targeted therapy, as
suggested for erlotinib in pancreatic cancer [27]. HER3positive pancreatic cancers are more sensitive to erlotinib
because it prevents transactivation of HER3 by EGFR and
thus inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, but not
the ERK cascade, which is mainly mutated in pancreatic
cancer. Similarly, the impact on HER3 expression in
response to pertuzumab is driven through the PI3K
pathway, but we suggest that HER2/HER3 heterodimers
are mostly involved in this case. HER3 mRNA expression
has been proposed also as a biomarker of pertuzumab
response in ovarian cancer, but its role is unclear and
controversial [10, 28, 29].
Finally, based on the results on HER3 activity
following pertuzumab treatment, we compared the effects
of direct (9F7-F11 mAb) and indirect (pertuzumab)
targeting of HER3 in pancreatic tumor xenografts.
Pertuzumab and 9F7-F11, had comparable effects on
tumor growth, but the underlying cellular mechanisms
were different. 9F7-F11 stimulated HER3 homodimer
formation, probably due to the antibody bivalency, that
could lead to unproductive HER3/HER3 association and
subsequently to HER3 homodimer down-regulation and
degradation. Conversely, pertuzumab treatment increased
HER3 expression at the cell membrane and decreased the
percentage of HER2/HER3 heterodimers. This finding
provides a rationale for testing the use of HER3 inhibitors
in combination with pertuzumab in PI3K/AKT-dependent
pancreatic cancers. Indeed, co-treatment with pertuzumab
and 9F7-F11 strongly increased their anti-tumor
effect in the HER3-positive BxPC-3 xenograft model
through enhanced HER3 down-regulation, disruption of
heterodimers and stronger inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ERK pathways. This suggests that a more complete and
sustained inhibition of HER3 is necessary to block PI3K
function and disable HER2 signaling to PI3K in HER2/
HER3-expressing pancreatic cancer.
The therapeutic efficacy of pertuzumab in HER2low pancreatic carcinomas needs now to be investigated
in a Phase I clinical trial to be fully validated. Our findings
provide evidence that HER3 expression in pancreatic
cancer biopsies should be investigated as a biomarker of
pertuzumab efficacy and to identify patients who might
benefit from this therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab were from Roche
Pharma AG (Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). The antiHER3 antibody 9F7-F11 was produced in our laboratory,
as previously described [17]. The anti-HER2 mouse
monoclonal antibody (mAb) FSP77 was kindly provided
by N. Hynes [Basel, Switzerland]. Neuregulin 1 beta
1-extracellular domain (ECD) (NRG1β1) was purchased
from RD Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Cell lines and culture
The BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, HPAC and MiaPaCa-2
cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD).
The Capan-1APS cell line, which was derived from a
xenograft of Capan-1 cells, was kindly provided by L.
Buscail (Toulouse, France). The PancPec cell line was
derived from a human pancreatic tumor specimen by
Charles Theillet in our institute.

Flow cytometry
The expression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 was
analyzed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies
against human EGFR [cetuximab], HER2 (FSP77) and
HER3 (SC53279, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) as previously described [6].

Cell proliferation assay
The effect of NRG1β1 and pertuzumab on cell
proliferation was evaluated using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]2H tetrazolium (MTS) and the electron coupling reagent
phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as already described [17].

and 10 nM H4B-121-Lumi4™ Tb plus 10 nM H4B-121
d2, respectively).

RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA samples were first reverse transcribed using the
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was then
assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a Light
Cycler 480 SYBR Green I Master apparatus (Roche
Applied Science). The primer sequences are presented in
Supplementary data. PCR amplifications were performed
in a standard 384-well plate format with a Roche LC480
real-time PCR detection system. For data analysis, the
raw threshold cycle (CT) value was first compared
to a standard curve to determine each cDNA relative
concentration. These concentrations were then normalized
to the housekeeping gene concentration and expressed
relatively to the untreated samples.

Tumor xenografts and treatment
All in vivo experiments were performed in
compliance with the French regulations and ethical
guidelines for experimental animal studies in an accredited
establishment (Agreement No. C34-172-27). Six week/
old female athymic mice, purchased from Harlan (Le
Malcourlet, France), were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank with parental shHER3 (3.5x106) or
control shLuc BxPC-3 cells (4.5x106), Capan-1APS
(10x106), MiaPaCa-2 (5.3x106), CFPAC-1 (5x106),
HPAC (5x106) or PancPec (10x106) cells. Tumor-bearing
mice were randomized to different treatment groups (at
least 6 animals/group) when tumors reached a volume
of 100 mm3 and were then treated with 2 or 10 mg/kg
pertuzumab, 10 mg/kg 9F7-F11 or the pertuzumab plus
9F7-F11 combination [10 mg/kg of each mAb]. Antibodies
were given intraperitonally (i.p.) twice a week for 4 weeks.
Tumor volumes were calculated by using the formula: D1 x
D2 x D3 /2. For survival comparison, mice were sacrificed
when tumors reached a volume of 1000 mm3.

Short hairpin RNA constructs
Based on the work of Lee-Hoeflich et al. [8], two
short hairpin oligonucleotides were chosen to knockdown
HER3 mRNA levels (Supplementary Materials and
Methods). The annealed shRNA sequences were digested
with BamH I and EcoRI and inserted into the RNAi-Ready
pSIREN-RetroQ Vector (Clontech). The control vector
(shCTRL) pSIREN-shLuc was kindly provided by L. Le
Cam and described previously [19]. pSIREN-shHER3 and
pSIREN-shLuc, which contain the puromycin resistance
gene, were transfected in the amphotropic packaging cell
line AmphoPack-293 [Clontech]. Supernatants containing
replication-defective virus particles were collected and
used to infect BxPC3 cells. After 7 days of selection,
cells were subcloned and selected based on the absence of
endogenous HER3 protein expression.

Immunohistochemistry
Surgically excised, formalin-fixed, paraffin
embedded (FFPE) PDAC specimens were cut into 4-µm
sections that were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated
in graded alcohols. For HER2, antigen retrieval was
performed in CC1 buffer (Ventana) at 95°C for 20 min.
Sections were then incubated with rabbit monoclonal
anti-HER2 (clone 4B5, PATHWAY HER-2/neu, Ventana)
for 20 min at 37°C. The antigen-antibody reaction was
visualized by using UltraView DAB Reveal System
and a Ventana Benchmark IHC staining automate. For
HER3, antigen retrieval was performed at 97°C for
20 min in EnVision® Target Retrieval Solution High
pH (Dako). Sections were then incubated at 37°C with
mouse monoclonal anti-HER3 (clone DAK-H3-IC, Dako,
Glostrup, Denmak) diluted at 1:50 for 2 h. The antigenantibody reaction was revealed using EnVision® Flex
DAB System and a Dako Autostainer Plus automate. IHC
staining was interpreted by an expert pathologist who
was blind to the patients’ information. HER2 and HER3
protein expression were semi-quantified using an arbitrary
scale of increasing intensity (from 0 to 3).

Western blot analysis
BxPC-3 cells were lysed and western blotting
performed as previously described [18]. Membranes were
incubated with the anti-human HER3 (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) and anti-human HER2, ERK1/2, AKT, or antiphosphorylated HER3, HER2, ERK1/2 or AKT antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Equal loading
was assessed with an antibody against ß-actin (Cell
Signaling Technology).

HER2/HER3 dimer analysis

Statistical Analysis

HER2/HER3 dimers were quantified using an
antibody-based TR-FRET assay, as described [18], except
for the detection of HER2 and HER3 homodimers (10 nM
Trastuzumab-Lumi4™ Tb plus 10 nM Trastuzumab-d2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The statistical analysis of tumor xenograft was
performed using the STATA 11.0 software (StataCorp.,
College Station, TX) as described [17]. The statistical
