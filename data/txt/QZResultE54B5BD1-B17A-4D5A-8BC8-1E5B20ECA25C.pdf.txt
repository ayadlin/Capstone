BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 3 regimens, cladribine alone, cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination, or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination in previously untreated
patients with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LGNHL).

METHODS. For this 3-arm, phase 3 study, 197 patients were randomly allocated to
receive 6 monthly courses of cladribine alone, cladribine and cyclophosphamide
combination, or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination.
Patients for whom all clinical data were available and 162 patients who completed scheduled chemotherapy were analyzed for the endpoints of this study.

RESULTS. Compared with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination regimen, cladribine alone or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination induced higher probability of overall response (odds ratio [OR] 5 4.0; 95%

tional Prognostic Index in multivariate analysis, treatment with cladribine-containing regimens remained an independent prognostic factor for progression-free
survival (v2 5 35.94; hazard ratio 5 2.38; P < .0002). Incidences of infections
were similar in the randomized groups, whereas cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination, but not cladribine alone, induced more frequent neutropenia,
anemia, and thrombocytopenia compared with cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
and prednisone combination (P < .05 for each). This resulted in a higher frequency of prolongation of intervals between cladribine and cyclophosphamide
combination and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination
cycles (P < .05), but dose reductions due to hematological or other toxicity did
not differ significantly in cladribine alone, cladribine and cyclophosphamide
combination, and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination
groups.

CONCLUSIONS. For patients with LGNHL, first-line cladribine alone or cladribine
and cyclophosphamide combination regimens both provided similar treatment
responses, acceptable toxicity, and better response rates than cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, and prednisone combination. Cancer 2008;113:367–75.  2008 American

L

ow grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas
(LGNHL) are a heterogenous group of entities with
different clinical presentations and treatment outcomes depending on histopathological diagnosis. The
initial disease presentation often shows advanced disease stage and continuous relapse pattern. Although
their clinical course is indolent and median overall
survival varies from 5 to 10 years from diagnosis,
LGNHL are incurable in the vast majority of cases. As
disease relapse is a part of LGNHL nature, establishing
treatment options that lead to better therapy response
rates and longer progression-free survival remains the
main goal of clinical trials in this group of patients.
Previous clinical studies have shown no benefit
from up-front treatment with alkylating agents in
asymptomatic patients without massive local involvement. Once chemotherapy was indicated, the most
commonly applied first-line treatments were chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, with or without vincristine
and prednisone (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone combination). The incorporation of doxorubicin and/or radiotherapy into cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, and prednisone combination showed no
benefit in terms of disease outcome, although toxicity
was significantly higher. However, a subset of patients
with LGNHL who received more intensive combination chemotherapy might have experienced improved
disease control and survival.1–3
The phase 1 and 2 clinical trials that used purine
analogs in the first-line therapy of patients with
LGNHL revealed response rates and progression-free

survival rates comparable to or higher than the
above-mentioned treatments, with especially high
activity in small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. However, toxicity, including
myelosuppression and increased susceptibility to
infections, was more pronounced than with standard
chemotherapy.4–9
Several studies that compared cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination to
fludarabine-containing regimens were conducted in
LGNHL, but cladribine use in first-line chemotherapy
was not sufficiently documented in phase 3 studies.
Thus, to establish the role of cladribine-containing
regimens in this setting, including follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginalzone lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma,
we designed this prospective, randomized, phase 3
study. Importantly, the study protocol was launched
before rituximab had become widely available and
before studies of maintenance immunotherapy in
follicular lymphoma were conducted. This allowed
us to enroll rituximab-naive patients and to treat
them with chemotherapy alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Criteria for Eligibility
A phase 3, prospective, randomized trial was conducted to compare efficacy and toxicity of cladribine
alone, cladribine combined with cyclophosphamide,
and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone

combination in previously untreated patients with
LGNHL, including follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal-zone lymphoma, and
small lymphocytic lymphoma. All 17 participating
centers cooperate within the Polish Lymphoma
Research Group. Patients were required to be older
than 18 years of age and to have a 3-month or
greater life expectancy. Central nervous system involvement, human immunodeficiency virus infection,
previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, other malignancy, pregnancy, inappropriate organ function, or
patient noncompliance were exclusion criteria. The
study protocol met the regulatory authorities’
requirements. All participants gave informed, written
consent, and their confidentiality was preserved in
accordance with the Polish regulations for studies on
human subjects.

Staging Studies
Pathological confirmation of the diagnosis of LGNHL
and clinical history were available in every case. Histological diagnoses were established according to the
World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The
initial medical evaluation comprised a complete history and physical examination, chest radiographic
examination, computed tomographic scan of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and laboratory tests
including complete blood count, bilirubin, alanine
and asparagine phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), b2-microglobulin, uric acid, creatinine, and
protein level with electrophoresis. The extent of disease and presence of systemic symptoms (B symptoms) were categorized according to the Ann Arbor
classification, and performance status was assessed
by using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) criteria. Treatment outcome was assessed
according to criteria established by the International
Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for NonHodgkin Lymphomas.10
Randomization and Treatment Schedule
Between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2005, 197 patients
were randomized to treatment with 6 cycles of either
cladribine alone (0.12 mg/kg 2-hours infusion intravenously [iv] on Days 1 to 5 every 28 days) or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination (cladribine,
0.12 mg/kg 2-hours infusion iv on Days 1 to 5; cyclophosphamide, 800 mg/m2 bolus iv on Day 1 every 28
days), or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination (cyclophosphamide, 800 mg/m2
bolus iv on Day 1; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 bolus iv on
Day 1; prednisone 45 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 to 4
every 21 days). Patients were centrally randomized
by using facsimile confirmation.

369

Three weeks after completion of the third cycle
of chemotherapy, staging was repeated to assess
response and, thus, subsequent therapy. When complete remission, unconfirmed complete remission,
partial remission, or stable disease was observed, 3
additional cycles were administered. Only when
progressive disease occurred at the time of a restaging procedure, then the choice of second-line
chemotherapy was made by centers for each patient
individually.
On Day 1 of each cycle, neutrophil and platelet
counts must have exceeded 1.5 3 109/L and 50 3
109/L, respectively. If these values were not reached,
then chemotherapy interval prolongation was
allowed up to 4 additional weeks. If at 8 weeks after
the previous cycle these parameters were not
achieved, then further modifications were performed
individually according to clinical indications. After
administration of vincristine, if neuropathy was
observed, then a dose reduction of 50% or replacement by an adequate dose of vinblastine was
allowed. Follow-up phase was based on local guidelines with at least 1 follow-up visit every 3 months.
In any case of disease progression or death, referral
to an appropriate coordinating center was mandatory. Patients who prematurely terminated the study
for any cause, including withdrawal of consent, histopathological diagnosis, protocol violation, or clinical indications, were excluded from further analysis.

Endpoints
The study was aimed to assess treatment outcome
and toxicity. The primary endpoint was progressionfree survival calculated from either the onset of treatment until disease progression or last follow-up
evaluation. The overall response rates, including
complete remission, unconfirmed complete remission, partial remission, and overall survival, as well
as grade 3-4 hematological and nonhematological
toxicities were secondary endpoints. Overall survival
was measured as the time between the beginning of
treatment and death from any cause or the date of
the last follow-up evaluation. Standard WHO criteria
were used for evaluation of chemotherapy-induced
toxicities. Adverse events, observed at each course,
with at least WHO grade 3 were recorded by using
detailed case report forms. Incidences of chemotherapy dose reductions and/or prolongation of intervals
between cycles were also recorded.
Sample Size
The original planned sample size was calculated to
detect a 20% difference in the proportion of patients
remaining free from disease progression at 18

months, in favor of any of the cladribine-containing
regimens. This was determined, by consensus among
the participating investigators, to be a clinically relevant improvement in outcome before the era of
rituximab. Accordingly, with a 5 .05 and b 5 .2, 70
patients were required in each group (total study
sample of 210) within a plan to accrue patients over
a 3-year period.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses of categorical data were conducted using v2 or Fisher exact tests and continuous
variables were analyzed with Student t or Wilcoxon
tests. Logistic regression was used to estimate the
influence of the 3 treatment regimens on response
rates. Actuarial survival data were analyzed according
to the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared
by using the log-rank test. A multivariate regression
analysis with the Cox proportional hazard model was
used to adjust the effect of the cladribine-containing
regimens for potential independent prognostic factors. Statistical tests with P < .05 were considered
significant. All reported P values were 2-sided. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS (version
14.0; SPSS, Chicago, Ill) and Statistica (version 7;
StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla) software.

RESULTS
A total of 197 patients from 17 institutions of the Polish Lymphoma Research Group were enrolled onto
the study between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2005.
Accrual was slower than expected, mostly because of
the introduction of rituximab into clinical practice in
Poland, but analysis after longer follow-up suggested
that a sufficient number of events had occurred to
allow assessment of progression-free survival. Of 197
randomized patients, 24 were further excluded from
final analysis, including 9 for inappropriate histology
on pathology center review, 8 for withdrawn consent,
and 7 for protocol violation. In addition, for 11
patients, data were not complete at the time of final
analysis performed July 1, 2006. Finally, 162 patients
who completed all 6 cycles of scheduled chemotherapy and for whom all clinical data were available
were analyzed for endpoints of the study. Patients’
demographic and baseline clinical characteristics
were similar among randomized groups (Table 1).
Interim analysis performed on July 1, 2004
included 105 of 165 (63.6%) randomized patients
who had completed at least 6 cycles of scheduled
chemotherapy. Of 105 analyzed patients, 38 (36.2%)
were diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma, 8
(7.6%) with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, 22 (21%)

with marginal-zone lymphoma, 33 (31.4%) with follicular lymphoma, and 4 (3.8%) with not otherwise
specified B-cell LGNHL. Randomization produced
comparable groups, including International Prognostic Index prognostic factors. Compared with cladribine alone and cladribine and cyclophosphamide
combination, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone combination induced lower overall
response rates (75%, 85%, 51%, respectively; v2
P < .005), including complete remission and unconfirmed complete remission rates (43%, 62.5%, 5.5%,
respectively; v2 P < .001). With a median follow-up of
10 months, median progression-free survival was
superior in patients who were receiving cladribinecontaining regimens (8, 11, and 6 months, respectively; v2 5 15.1; log-rank P < .001). No difference in
median overall survival was detected (9, 12, and 7
months, respectively; v2 5 1.15; log-rank P 5 .56). In
conclusion, we found that first-line chemotherapy
with cladribine alone and cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination regimens both provided similar response rates, progression-free survival, and
overall survival, and better results than cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination.
This has resulted in discontinuation of accrual into
the cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone
combination group July 1, 2004 and further recruitment into cladribine alone and cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination arms through June 30,
2005.
The final analysis of 162 patients, performed July
1, 2006, comprised 56 (34.6%) patients with small
lymphocytic lymphoma, 12 (7.4%) with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, 40 (24.7%) with marginal-zone
lymphoma, 46 (28.4%) with follicular lymphoma, and
8 (4.9%) with not otherwise specified B-cell LGNHL.
Randomization provided comparable groups, including International Prognostic Index variables. The
imbalances in sample sizes resulted from discontinuation of accrual in the cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination group since the
interim analysis (Table 1). Of 162 patients, 59 (36.4%)
patients achieved complete remission or unconfirmed complete remission, 59 (36.4%) achieved partial remission, and 44 (27.2%) achieved stable disease
or progressive disease. The detailed treatment
response after 6 courses of chemotherapy by randomized group is listed in Table 2. Compared with cyclophosphamide,
vincristine,
and
prednisone
combination, cladribine alone or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination was associated with a
higher probability of overall response achievement in
univariate logistic regression analysis (OR 5 4.0; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.7-9.3; P 5 .002, and OR 5

probability of complete remission and unconfirmed

combination regimen compared with those receiving
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination (OR 5 5.8; 95% CI, 1.8–18.5; P 5 .003, and

162 patients, 83 (51%) patients experienced disease
progression, and 37 (23%) patients died. With a median follow-up of the patients remaining alive at 36
months, progression-free survival was longer in
patients who were receiving cladribine alone or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination than in
those treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine,

overall survival was detected among randomized

group of 162 randomized patients, similar results in
treatment response rates, progression-free survival,
and overall survival were observed in different histological subtypes of LGNHL, including small lymphocytic lymphoma (n 5 56), follicular lymphoma (n 5
46), and marginal-zone lymphoma (n 5 40) (data not
shown).
To evaluate the importance of cladribine-containing regimens on LGNHL outcome, a multivariate
regression analysis was performed. The Cox model
was tested by introducing the cladribine alone or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination treatment status along with prognostic variables of the
International Prognostic Index, ie, age (60 years of
age or older), Ann Arbor disease stage (I–II or III–IV),
ECOG performance status (0–1 or 2–4), serum activity of LDH (normal or above upper normal limit),
and number of extranodal sites of disease (0–1 or
>1). After incorporating the International Prognostic
Index (0–1 vs 2–3 vs 4–5 adverse factors) in multivariate analysis, treatment with the cladribine-containing
regimens remained an independent prognostic factor
for longer progression-free survival (v2 5 35.94; HR
5 2.38; P < .0002) (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
The choice of the initial treatment for a given patient
with LGNHL is controversial and should be directed
toward obtaining the highest remission rate of longest duration while restricting morbidity and cost without compromising salvage treatment efficacy.11–13
Purine analogs are unique among conventional
antimetabolites as they are cytotoxic to both resting
and proliferating lymphocytes. This property confers
their advantage over standard therapies in the treatment of malignancies with low-growth fractions,
such as LGNHL. In relapsed LGNHL, fludarabine
induced a slightly longer progression-free survival
compared with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone combination, but no differences in
response rates or median overall survival between
the 2 treatment groups were observed.14 In contrast,
the efficacy of fludarabine combinations, especially

in relapsed or refractory LGNHL, has been demonstrated with impressive remission rates of 70% to
100%.15–17 Similar results with cladribine alone on
previously untreated and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients have been published.7,8
To our knowledge, this prospective, controlled
trial that compared the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine-containing regimens and cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, and prednisone combination in previously untreated patients with LGNHL is the only
study reported in the literature so far. Considering
treatment response, our results show that first-line
cladribine alone or cladribine and cyclophosphamide
combination regimens both provided close response
rates and similar progression-free survival, clearly
superior to cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination. This was observed since the interim analysis of this trial and caused the cessation
of accrual in the cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone combination arm thereafter.18 This decision appeared reliable both from statistical and ethical viewpoints. Importantly, our findings were similar
to those of previously published phase 2 trials that
evaluated initial treatment with cladribine alone in
patients with LGNHL.6,9
In the trial comparing fludarabine with CVP, no
benefit regarding time to treatment failure was
observed, even with significantly improved complete
remission rates in the fludarabine arm.4 Other phase
2 studies in untreated patients indicated fludarabine
complete remission rates of 37% to 47% and overall
response ratios up to 65%, which is consistent with
our results in the cladribine alone arm.5,19 Higher
overall response rates and complete remission rates

phosphamide combination-treated patients can be
partly explained by differences in the distribution of
histopathological entities in our cohort. Follicular
lymphoma represents 40% to 60% of LGNHL and
15% to 30% of all lymphomas and, thus, is 1 of the
most frequent lymphoma subtypes that have an
increasing incidence in western countries.20 In contrast, follicular lymphoma occurs in only 8% of newly
diagnosed LGNHL in Poland, as demonstrated by the
National Cancer Registry and population-based survey performed in the southern part of Poland.21
As in many other comparative studies, the differences in remission rates and even prolonged progression-free survival, did not create differences in overall
survival. This is not surprising because, whatever the
randomization group, a majority of included patients
received second-line and even subsequent treatments
over the course of their disease, obscuring the interpretation of survival curves. Similar conclusions have
been outlined in other prospective studies.4,5,7,8
Recent clinical trials have convincingly demonstrated that combined immunochemotherapy is
superior to conventional chemotherapy and should be
considered a standard approach in first-line, including
both induction and maintenance, therapy.22–25
Regardless of the final results of phase 3 primary
rituximab maintenance (PRIMA) trial that addressed
the most effective chemoimmunotherapy of LGNHL
(R-CHOP, R-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination, R-MCP, and R-CHVP-IFN), it can
be anticipated that similar improvements in outcomes
will be associated when combining rituximab with
cladribine or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination. In a prospective study of recurrent LGNHL,
a similar combined approach consisting of rituximab,
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone (RFCM) resulted not only in significantly improved
response rates and prolonged progression-free survival, but also, more importantly, improved overall
survival.26 In addition, high activity of cladribine alone
or cladribine and cyclophosphamide combination and
rituximab has also been observed.27,28
Although purine analogs are generally well tolerated, and their toxicity profile seems comparable to
other regimens, both fludarabine and cladribine are
associated with immunosuppression, and physicians
should be aware of an increased risk of opportunistic
infections.27 The therapeutic strategy adopted in this
study was aimed at minimizing the potential for cumulative myelosuppression and immunosuppression.
Accordingly, the maximal number of cladribine
courses was limited to 6, and therapy was discontinued when there was significant protracted myelosuppression or a lack of ongoing response to treatment.

In fact, we observed increased hematological toxicity
in the cladribine-containing regimens arms compared with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone combination, particularly in the cladribine
and cyclophosphamide combination arm. This
resulted in a higher frequency of prolongation of
intervals between cladribine and cyclophosphamide
combination cycles, but dose reductions due to
hematological or other toxicities as well as incidences of infections did not differ significantly
among randomized groups. The latter could be
related to the finding that cladribine-containing regimens were administered to previously untreated
patients, whereas increased incidence of infectious
complications associated with purine analogs were
mostly observed in heavily pretreated individuals.29
Nevertheless, when compared with other chemotherapeutic protocols, purine analog-based therapies display some disadvantages in a first-line treatment
setting. Particularly, their cumulative stem cell toxic
effect has to be considered if an autologous stem-cell
transplantation is planned.30,31
In conclusion, selection of a chemotherapy regimen to be combined with immunotherapy in firstline therapy of LGNHL still remains an open question. Once settled, the decision must consider not
only the quality of remission and its duration but
also early and delayed safety profiles. New insights
into the underlying biology of different histological
subtypes of LGNHL and broader use of established
and new prognostic and/or predictive factors are
anticipated to help guide therapy for individual
patients. Our study demonstrates that cladribinecontaining regimens are acceptable candidates for
further chemoimmunotherapy studies in this setting.
