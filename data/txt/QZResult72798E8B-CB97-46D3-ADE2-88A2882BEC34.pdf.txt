BACKGROUND. The majority of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) clinical trials that examined targeted agents
used progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint. Whether PFS can be used as a predictor of overall survival
(OS) is unknown. METHODS. Patients from 12 cancer centers who received targeted therapy for mRCC were identified.
Landmark analyses for progression at 3 months and 6 months after drug initiation were performed to minimize lead-time
bias. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the utility of PFS for predicting OS. RESULTS. In total, 1158
patients were included. The median follow-up was 30.6 months, the median age was 60 years, and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80%. For the entire cohort, the median PFS was 7.6 months, and the median OS was
19.7 months. In the landmark analysis, the median OS for patients who progressed at 3 months was 7.8 months compared with 23.6 months for patients who did not progress (log-rank test; P < .0001). Similarly, for patients who progressed at 6 months, the median OS was 8.6 months compared with 26 months for patients who did not progress (P
< .0001). Compared with those who did not progress, for the patients who progressed at 3 months and at 6 months,
the hazard ratios for death adjusted for adverse prognostic factors were 3.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.42-3.84)
and 2.96 (95% confidence interval, 2.39-3.67), respectively. Similar results were demonstrated with landmark analyses
at 9 months and at 12 months and in the bootstrap validation. Kendall tau rank correlation and a Fleischer model
demonstrated a statistically significant dependent correlation. CONCLUSIONS. PFS at 3 months and at 6 months predicted OS, and the current results indicated that PFS may be a meaningful intermediate endpoint for OS in patients

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has been revolutionized by the introduction of agents that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Progression-free survival
(PFS) has been used as the primary endpoint for the majority of clinical trials that investigate these patients. Trials involving sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, everolimus, and pazopanib demonstrated a PFS benefit, which subsequently led to
their regulatory approval.1-6 With the exception of 1 trial that involved temsirolimus in patients with a poor prognosis,7
the vast majority of these trials did not prove an overall survival (OS) benefit and cited issues of crossover and

contamination of the control arm. This potentially was
because patients in the control arm were allowed to receive
the active agent or were treated with similar second-line
and third-line agents, which may have led to the dilution
of any apparent OS benefit. Because of the emergence of
second-line and third-line targeted therapies, an OS benefit may be difficult to prove in a trial setting.
In the current study, we sought to determine whether
there is an association between PFS and OS, which is the
traditional gold standard of all endpoints, and whether or
not there is any dependence between these 2 endpoints. This
has implications for future drug evaluation and trial design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
In total, 1158 patients with mRCC who received treatment with contemporary targeted therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, temsirolimus) were included in this
study. They were identified from consecutive, population-based patient samples during 2005 through 2009 at
12 international cancer centers in Canada (Toronto Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center [n ¼ 158], Princess Margaret Hospital [n ¼ 95], British Columbia Cancer Agency
[n ¼ 100], Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Center [n
¼ 76], and Alberta Health Services Cancer Care [n ¼
134]), the United States (Dana Farber Cancer Institute
and Brigham and Women’s Hospital [n ¼ 177], Cleveland Clinic [n ¼ 113], Karmanos Cancer Center [n ¼
89], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [n ¼ 74]), Singapore (National Cancer Center [n ¼ 80]). and Denmark
(Aarhus University Hospital [n ¼ 62]).
Patients may have been treated on clinical trial or off
protocol and may have been treated at major academic centers or community oncology centers. Baseline patient characteristics and outcome data were collected using uniform
data-collection templates in this large retrospective analysis.8
Regulatory approval from local institutional review boards
or research ethics boards was obtained for each center.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was OS, which was defined as the
time from drug initiation to the date of death from any
cause or was censored at last the follow-up. PFS was
defined as the time from drug initiation to the time of disease progression or death or was censored at last the follow-up. We defined disease progression according to
standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).9

Data Analysis
Landmark analyses of PFS at 3 months and 6 months after
drug initiation were performed to minimize lead-time
bias. These time points were defined a priori because they
were likely to coincide with the routine radiographic
assessment of patients who receive VEGF-targeted therapy. Thus, this would be clinically useful to determine
whether disease progression at these early time points
would be able to predict a difference in OS. Studies in
other tumors, such as prostate cancer, have justified the
use of 3-month and 6-month landmark analyses.10 The
patients who died before 3 months or 6 months were
excluded in the 3-month landmark analysis or the 6month landmark analysis, respectively, to provide the
most conservative estimate of effect.10
The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to estimate the OS of patients stratified by disease progression at
3 months or 6 months. Exploratory analyses also were performed at 9 months and at 12 months, but those analyses
were subjected to lead-time bias. A proportional hazards
model was used to assess the significance of progression at 3
months or 6 months in predicting OS when adjusted for
poor prognostic factors, including a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%, time from diagnosis to treatment
<1 year, anemia, hypercalcemia, thrombocytosis, and neutrophilia.8 Similar analyses were performed that adjusted
for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
poor prognostic criteria.11 The proportionality assumption
was met by graphically assessing plots of log(-log[survival])
versus log of survival time. The case deletion method was
used to handle missing values in all explanatory variables.
The correlation between PFS and OS was estimated
using the statistical model for dependence between PFS and
OS developed by Fleischer et al.12 That model follows a parametric approach, which investigates how much variability of
OS can be explained by variability from PFS. In the model,
OS is partitioned as a sum of the time to progression (TTP
 Exp[k1]) and postprogression survival (PPS  Exp[k3]) if
patients progress before dying. In patients who have not
experienced progression, PFS is equal to OS (Exp[k2]). The
correlation between PFS and OS is obtained by:

requires an exponential distribution for time variables, we
graphically assessed this assumption using the plot of
negative log of survival distribution (LS) against time. This
curve should be approximately linear through the origin if
the exponential model is appropriate.12
We also investigated the nonparametric Kendall tau
rank correlation for bivariate censored data,13 which has
been used in previous studies of surrogate endpoints in
prostate cancer.10 This is a more conservative measure
and does not require data conforming to certain distributions. However, the Kendall tau considers PFS and OS as
independent events and ignores the reality that OS inherently contains PFS information. The Kendal Tau correlation was calculated by using the cenken function from the
R NADA library (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
NADA/index.html) modified for right double censored
time to event data.
The standard errors of the correlation statistics
(Fleischer model and Kendall tau) were estimated using
the bootstrap method with 300 replications. The bootstrap
confidence intervals (CIs) were computed based on the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution of the statistic. For the
landmark analysis, 300 bootstrap samples were generated
similarly at each landmark time point. We refit the Cox
regression models and calculated the adjusted hazard ratios
as in the original analysis. The bootstrap means and CIs
were computed and compared with the model using the
original study population at each landmark time point.
Bootstrap analysis was done using the statistical software package R version 2.8.0 (http://cran.r-project.org).
All other statistical analyses were undertaken using SAS
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All statistical
tests were 2-sided, and P values <.05 were considered
significant.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
In total, 1158 patients were included in the current analysis. At the time of the analyses, the median follow-up of
the entire cohort was 30.6 months, and 81% of patients
had progressed. The median KPS was 80% and the median age was 60 years. Thirty-one percent of patients had
received previous immunotherapy, 80% had previously
undergone nephrectomy, 77% had >1 metastatic site,
and 8% had brain metastases. The risk groups according
to the criteria published by Heng et al8 were favorable, intermediate, and poor for 21.1%, 50.2%, and 28.7% of
patients, respectively. MSKCC risk groups11 were favor-

Landmark Analyses
In the landmark analysis, the median OS for patients who
progressed at 3 months was 7.8 months compared with
23.6 months for the patients who did not progress (logrank test; P < .0001) (Fig. 1). Similarly, for the patients
who progressed at 6 months versus those who did not progress, the median OS was 8.6 versus 26.0 months, respectively (P < .0001). For the patients who progressed at 3
months and 6 months, compared with those who did not
progress, the hazard ratios for death adjusted for adverse
prognostic factors8 were 3.05 (95% CI, 2.42-3.84) and
2.96 (95% CI, 2.39-3.67), respectively. Hazard ratios
when adjusted for the MSKCC prognostic groups (data
not shown) and additional landmark analyses at 9 and 12
months (Table 2) all revealed consistent findings. Bootstrap analyses that were performed at 3 months, 6 months,
9 months, and 12 months produced very similar hazard
ratios, confirming the high internal validity of these
results. All of the aforementioned hazard ratios had a P
value <.0001.

Reasons for exclusion: 1) death before landmark time (n¼109 [3 mo], n¼214 [6 mo], n¼285 [9 mo], and n¼362 [12 mo]), 2) follow-up for survival or disease
not reaching landmark time (n¼42 [3 mo], n¼80 [6 mo], n¼135 [9 mo], n¼175 [12 mo]), and 3) missing OS/progression-free survival data (n¼5).

Correlation Analyses
For all patients (n ¼ 1158), the median PFS was 7.6
months (95% CI, 6.8-8.2 months), and the median OS
was 19.7 months (95% CI, 18.1-21.6 months). The median post-progression survival (PPS) for patients who progressed before death was 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.8-9.3
months). The negative log survival distribution curves followed a straight line through the origin, indicating satisfaction of the exponential distribution (data not shown).
By using the Fleischer model, the estimated correlation
between PFS and OS was 0.66 (bootstrap standard error
[SE], 0.025; 95% CI, 0.61-0.71). This means that
approximately 44% (r2 ¼ 0.662) of the variability in OS
can be explained by PFS. The calculated Kendall tau correlation was 0.42 (bootstrap SE, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.39-

2640

0.45; P < .0001), which suggested a statistically significant dependence between PFS and OS.

DISCUSSION
In the landmark analyses at each time point, we demonstrated that patients with mRCC who progressed on contemporary targeted therapy had an approximately 3 times
increased risk of dying compared with patients at the same
time point who remained progression free. A significant
positive relation between PFS and OS was observed, as
demonstrated by the Kendall tau statistic (0.42) and the
Fleischer model (0.66). The Kendall tau statistic is a nonparametric measure of association between 2 censored variables and likely underestimated the true correlation

Clinical Trial Endpoints/Heng et al

between PFS and OS, because it ignored the inherent reality that OS contains PFS. The Fleischer model was developed specifically to describe this relation and, thus, may
be a better estimate.12
To determine whether our results were consistent
with expected values, we used a recent simulation study by
Broglio and Berry,14 which suggested that the correlation
between PFS and OS relies on the duration of postprogression survival (PPS). When the median PPS is short, the
hazard ratios for progression and OS are highly correlated.
According to simulation results, the estimated correlation
was 0.88 when the median PPS was 9 months, which is
higher than what we observed in our data (0.66). However, the Broglio and Berry14 simulation correlation was
from data that perfectly followed an exponential distribution analyzed in a simulated meta-analysis format instead
of using individual PFS and OS data for each patient as
was done in our study.
The current analysis is important, because the use of
OS as the gold-standard endpoint has become difficult in
contemporary clinical trials. Many patients with mRCC
in the control arms of randomized controlled trials eventually crossover to the active treatment or get contaminated by second-line or third-line drugs in the same drug
category. This contamination can be as high as 62%, as
documented in studies that examined bevacizumab plus
interferon4 and sunitinib.15 There may be ethical concerns of not allowing crossover of patients on the control
arm of clinical trials at the first hint of clinical activity on
the experimental arm. However, if patients do crossover,
then the OS benefit may be diluted. Thus, PFS may be
the only endpoint that is not affected by contamination
and crossover.
Intermediate endpoints like PFS and disease-free
survival have been validated in other cancers, such as adjuvant and metastatic treatments for colorectal cancer,16-18
and similar analyses have been published for prostate cancer.10 Although most regulatory agencies and public
health systems prefer to use OS data to make important
approval decisions, PFS may be a suitable endpoint if it
can be correlated with OS. This is especially true if there is
a large magnitude of difference in PFS between the 2
treatment arms. It is important to validate these surrogate
endpoints individually in each disease.
The strength of our study is that, to our knowledge,
it represents the largest collection of patients that includes
only those who received targeted therapy. Although
35.2% of patients in our study in fact did receive active
second-line and/or third-line therapies, we still were able

Cancer

June 15, 2011

to demonstrate a correlation between PFS and OS using
our study design. Most important, there was consistently
high internal validity, as demonstrated by bootstrap
validation.
Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, for which missing data and selection bias may be
encountered. However, standardized data collection templates were used, and only 5 patients had missing PFS
and/or OS data. In addition, these patients constituted a
consecutive series of patients from each institution,
thereby limiting selection bias. In fact, the inclusion of
consecutive patients created a patient population that was
diverse and that was not limited to clinical trials (approximately 15% were included in a randomized controlled
trial, not including expanded access programs); thus, this
may be a more generalizable study. Finally, there was no
central radiology review to determine progression in this
study. However, this actually may better reflect everyday
physician practices in the routine management of metastatic RCC and, thus, would make the results more
applicable.
We conclude that disease progression at 3 months
and at 6 months is associated with and can independently
predict OS and that there is a dependent relation between
PFS and OS. PFS may be the only endpoint that is not
hindered by the issues of contamination and crossover
that were observed for OS in most trials of targeted therapy, in which subsequent second-line and third-line targeted therapy were commonplace. These results require
prospective evaluation.
