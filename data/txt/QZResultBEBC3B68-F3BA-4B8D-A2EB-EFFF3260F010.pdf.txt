BACKGROUND: The authors hypothesized that comprehensive genomic profiling of advanced-stage cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma (cSCC) could identify genomic-derived drug targets of therapy for patients with conventional therapy-resistant disease.
METHODS: Comprehensive genomic profiling of 315 cancer genes was applied to 50 ng of DNA from 122 cSCC cases for the evaluation of all classes of genomic alterations (GAs). Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs) were defined as those identifying anticancer drugs on the market or in registered clinical trials. RESULTS: There were 21 women (17%) and 101 men (83%) with a median
age of 64.9 years (range, 21-87 years). Eleven cSCC cases (9%) were histologic AJCC grade 1, 69 (57%) were grade 2, and 42 (34%)
were grade 3. The primary cSCC was used for sequencing in 77 cases (63%). Metastatic lesions were sequenced in 37% of cases.
There were 1120 total GAs identified (average of 9.2 GAs per tumor), with 100% of cases harboring at least 1 alteration. Of the 122
cSCCs, 107 (88%) harbored at least 1 CRGA (2.5 CRGAs per cSCC) includingNOTCH1 (43%); patched 1 (PTCH1) (11%); BRCA2 (10%);
HRAS (8%); ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (7%); erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) (7%); neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1) (7%); erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) (6%); phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
(PIK3CA) (6%); cyclin D1 (CCND1) (6%); epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (5%); and F-box and WD repeat domain containing

INTRODUCTION
Nonmelanoma skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSSC) are by
far the most common of all types of cancer. In immunocompetent patients, BCC and cSCC account for approximately
80% and 20%, respectively, of cases of keratinocyte carcinomas.1 For immunosuppressed patients, including organ transplant recipients, this ratio is reversed.1 It has been estimated that in 2012, as many as 419,543 white individuals in the
United States developed clinically significant cSCC, as many as 12,572 developed lymph node metastasis, and as many as
8791 may have died from the disease.2 Given this high frequency of metastasis and disease-related death, it is now held
that metastatic cSCC is an underrecognized health issue.2 cSCC is usually a localized disease treated with topical agents
(eg, 5-flurouracil), surgical wide local excision, Mohs surgery, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, and radiotherapy. However,
despite these treatments, as many as 3% to 4% of patients with cSCC will develop either major local disease recurrence,
metastasis, or both.3 Regional lymph node involvement accounts for approximately 85% of metastatic cSCC cases, with
approximately 15% of cases having spread to the lungs, liver, brain, other skin sites, and bone.4 When cSCC evolves into a
systemic disease, the clinical outcome is currently guarded to poor, with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%.5 To the best of
our knowledge, there currently is no standard-of-care treatment for patients with metastatic cSCC.6 Combinations of

vismodegib is now widely in use,7 to our knowledge there
currently is no targeted treatment option for patients with
cSCC in wide use. In the current study, we performed
comprehensive genomic profiling of patients with recurrent and refractory advanced-stage cSCC to assess this tumor type for potential genomic therapy targets that could
unlock potential strategies for the use of targeted therapies
for this disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genomic profiling was performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, College of American Pathologists-accredited reference
laboratory. DNA extracted from clinical formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 122 consecutively
submitted cSCC samples was analyzed by hybridization
capture of all coding exons from 236 cancer-related genes
and selected introns from 19 genes commonly rearranged
in cancer (63 samples) or 315 cancer-related genes and 28
genes involved in rearrangements (59 samples). At least
50 ng of DNA per specimen was isolated and sequenced
to high, uniform coverage (mean, >3600) on the Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument (Illumina Inc, San Diego,
Calif), as previously described.8 Genomic alterations
(base substitutions, short insertions and deletions, focal
gene amplifications, homozygous deletions, and select
rearrangements) were determined and then reported for
each patient sample. To maximize mutation detection
sensitivity in heterogeneous cSCC biopsies and resections,
the test was validated to detect base substitutions at
10% mutant allele frequency with 99% sensitivity

As seen in Table 1 and Supporting Information
Table 1, there were 1120 total genomic alterations in the
122 cSCC cases, comprising 391 missense mutations, 619
truncating alterations (non-sense, frameshift, or splice
site), 71 focal gene amplifications, 38 homozygous deletions, and 1 gene rearrangement, with a median of 9.2
alterations per case. All 122 cSCC cases harbored at least 1
alteration. When the genomic alterations were subdivided
into classes, there were 391 base substitutions and short
insertions and deletions (35%), 71 gene amplifications
(6%), 38 homozygous deletions (3%), 619 gene truncations (55%), and 1 gene rearrangement (1%). As shown
in Figure 1 and Table 2, the most common alterations not
currently associated with direct therapy impacting clinical

One hundred and seven cases of cSCC (88%) harbored at least 1 clinically relevant genomic alteration,
with an average of 2.5 actionable genomic alterations per

In Figure 2, another EGFR-mutated cSCC in a 72year-old man with widespread recurrent and metastatic
disease was found to have a P753S EGFR mutation in the
absence of EGFR amplification, a CDKN2A mutation
(W110*), TP53 mutation (P278F), and MYC amplification.9 Treatment with the anti-EGFR antibody therapeutic cetuximab led to a major clinical response in this
patient that was associated with a significant symptomatic
improvement within a month of the initiation of therapy,
including reestablishment of peripheral nervous system
activity as demonstrated by return of sensation and motor
activity on the left side of the face. Subsequent scans demonstrated decreased infiltration of various nerves, which
had been present earlier. However, his disease burden was
not measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST). In Figure 3, a stage III cSCC
with basaloid histologic features diagnosed in a 71year-old man was associated with alterations in
ARID1A, ERBB4, PIK3CA, and PTCH1. There were 2
alterations in PTCH1 Q576* base substitution and the
splice site 1347 1 1G>A mutation. In Figure 4, a

benefit in patients with cSCC.
DISCUSSION
Although BCC and cSCC are traditionally referred to as
the “nonmelanoma” skin cancers, there are major differences in these 2 diseases beyond their typically distinctive

histologic appearance.1-5 The less common cSCC is usually a localized cancer treated mainly by local treatments
and surgical excisions, yet a certain subset of patients with
cSCC can pursue an aggressive course by either developing local recurrence, distant metastasis, or both.1-5 Given
the limited efficacy of standard-of-care chemotherapy and
radiotherapy for patients with locally aggressive or systemic disease,6 investigators have recently begun to study
the genomic background of cSCC in the hope that targeted therapies would emerge.10-12 Given the success of
targeted therapies for BRAF V600E mutations in melanoma, targeting the hedgehog pathway in BCC, and

treating activated growth factor receptors in patients with
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, hope has emerged that
similar strategies could emerge for individuals with
cSCC.13
The main risk factor for the development of cSCC
among light-skinned individuals is the cumulative DNA
damage on keratinocytes from prolonged exposure to
ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light mediates the development of cSCC predominantly by producing inactivating
mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.14 TP53
mutations were identified in 85% of the cSCC cases in the
current study, including 42% of base substitutions and
indels, 2% of homozygous deletions, and 56% of truncating mutations. This high frequency of TP53 mutations in
cSCC is widely recognized.10 Functional loss of tumor
suppressor p53 (which is encoded by the TP53 gene) is
common in aggressive advanced cancers, and it is estimated
that approximately 11 million individuals are living with a
tumor that contains an inactivating mutation of TP53 and
another 11 million have tumors in which the p53 pathway
is partially abrogated through the inactivation of other signaling or effector components.9 These TP53 mutations
are located within the DNA-binding domain of the p53
protein.10 DNA-binding domain mutations in TP53 are
believed to result in loss of function via the loss of transactivation of p53-dependent genes.15 Although there are experimental drugs in various stages of clinical trials
attempting to target tumors with TP53 mutations, to the
best of our knowledge there currently are no approved
agents acting directly on TP53 available outside of earlystage clinical trials.16 The second most important risk for
developing cSCC is immunosuppression and cSCC is
more common than BCC in organ transplant recipients
who are receiving treatment with immunosuppressive
therapies.17,18 In immunosuppressed patients, cSCC can
be highly aggressive and reach recurrent/refractory and
metastatic disease stages more quickly than cSCCs occurring in immunocompetent patients.17,18
Among 62% of cases, truncation mutations (19
cases), deletions (4 cases), and indel/substitutions (3 cases)

in CDKN2A were the second most frequent set of alterations noted in this series of cSCC cases. CDKN2A encodes
2 different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins,
p16INK4a and p14ARF. p16INK4a contributes to the
dysregulation of the Cdk4/6-cyclin-retinoblastoma (Rb)
pathway and loss of cell cycle control.19 Loss of heterozygosity or loss of function mutations in CDKN2A (both
the p16INK4a-encoding and p14ARF-encoding loci) have
been reported in 30% to 50% of patients with cSCC.20-22
CDKN2A is also altered by homozygous deletions and
epigenetic mechanisms in the vast majority of cSCC
cases.20-23 Preclinical data have suggested that tumors with
loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6
inhibitors, such as LEE011, LY2835219, and the US Food
and Drug Administration-approved inhibitor palbociclib.24-29 However, multiple clinical studies have shown no
significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and the therapeutic benefit of these agents.24-29
NOTCH1 is involved in regulating genes involved
in differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.30 Depending on the cellular context, NOTCH1 can act as either a
tumor suppressor or an oncogene.31 NOTCH1 mutations
have been reported in 57.1% of cSCC cases (16 of 28
cases) analyzed in Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in
Cancer (COSMIC).32 NOTCH1 was mutated in 43% of
cSCC cases in the current series. NOTCH1 mutations in
cSCC are primarily believed to be inactivating; furthermore, the loss of Notch is not involved in the initiating
event of multistage skin carcinogenesis, but acts as a skin
cancer-promoting event.33 Notch1 inhibitors (eg,
gamma-secretase inhibitors, which prevent cleavage of the
intracellular domain and anti-Notch1 antibody therapeutics) may be a potential therapeutic approach in the case
of NOTCH1-activating mutations and currently are in
clinical trials for a variety of malignant diseases.33-35
In the current series of cSCC, 8% of the cases featured HRAS mutations, a finding that is similar to the frequency of this alteration listed in the COSMIC
database.32,36 The frequency of HRAS alterations appears
to be enriched to >40% among cSCCs that develop in

patients with melanoma while receiving BRAF-targeted
therapy with vemurafeninib.37 The MEK inhibitor trametinib has been used successfully to treat the secondary
cSCC arising in these patients.38
EGFR has reported to be altered in 1% of the samples of SCC of the skin listed in the COSMIC database.32
In the current series, 6 of the recurrent and metastatic
cSCC cases (5%) were found to harbor an EGFR alteration, which included 4 amplifications, 1 base substitution,
and 1 gene rearrangement. Reports of EGFR amplification in cSCC have ranged from as low as 1% (COSMIC
database) to 20%.39 The patient described in Figure 2
who responded to the anti-EGFR antibody therapy with
cetuximab demonstrated the P753S mutation in EGFR.9
Small-molecule EGFR-targeted therapies, including erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, currently are being studied
in clinical trials of metastatic cSCC. In a phase 2 study,
gefitinib was included in the neoadjuvant treatment of
patients with aggressive cSCC and was associated with a
complete response rate of 18%.40
In Figure 3 in the current study, the cSCC featured
2 distinct inactivating mutations in PTCH1: the Q576*
base substitution and the 134711G> splice site mutation. These PTCH1 alterations result in loss of PTCH1
production, leaving smoothened (Smo) protein unbound
and resulting in activation of hedgehog pathway signaling.41 PTCH1 mutations have been reported in 8% of
cSCC samples (6 of 73 samples) in the COSMIC database.32 To the best of our knowledge, PTCH1 mutation
in cSCC has not been widely studied as a therapy target.
Alterations in PTCH1 also have been observed in patients
with SCC of the lung and head and neck and correlated
with an increased rate of disease recurrence and poor
prognosis.42 Activation of the hedgehog signaling
pathway may predict sensitivity to Smo inhibitors such as
vismodegib, a well-known approach for the treatment of
recurrent and refractory cutaneous BCC.7,43,44 Trials of
vismodegib and other Smo inhibitors are active in multiple tumor types including metastatic cSCC.
The results of the current study are similar to those
of previous reports highlighting the mutational landscape
in cSCC,45 but are focused on the discovery of genomic
targets that have the potential to guide targeted therapy
selection for patients with advanced and metastatic disease. In 88% of the 122 patients with recurrent, refractory, and metastatic cSCC, comprehensive genomic
profiling of their tumors was associated with the detection
of clinically relevant genomic alterations capable of potentially guiding therapeutic decisions. Genomic alterations
were found in multiple cancer progression-associated
256

biologic pathways. Given the early examples of patient
response to targeted therapy with metastatic cSCC, further evaluation of the genomic background of advanced
cSCC in the clinical trial setting appears warranted.
