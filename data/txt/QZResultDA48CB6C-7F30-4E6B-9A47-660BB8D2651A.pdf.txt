Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Synovial sarcoma is a deadly malignancy with limited sensitivity to traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy. SS18-SSX fusion oncogene expression characterizes human synovial sarcomas and
drives oncogenesis in a mouse model. Elevated expression of BCL2 is considered a consistent
feature of the synovial sarcoma expression profile. Our objective was to evaluate the expression of
apoptotic pathway members in synovial sarcomas and interrogate the impact of modulating SS18SSX expression on this pathway. We show in human and murine synovial sarcoma cells that
SS18-SSX increases BCL2 expression, but represses other anti-apoptotic genes, including MCL1
and BCL2A1. This repression is achieved by directly suppressing expression via binding through
ATF2 to the cyclic AMP response element in the promoters of these genes and recruiting TLE1/
Groucho. The suppression of these two anti-apoptotic pathways silences the typical routes by
which other tumors evade BH3-domain peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy. We show that mouse
and human synovial sarcoma cells are sensitive in vitro to ABT-263, a BH3-peptidomimetic,
much more so than are other tested cancer cell lines. ABT-263 also enhances the sensitivity of
these cells to doxorubicin, a traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy used for synovial sarcoma. We
also demonstrate the capacity of ABT-263 to stunt synovial sarcomagenesis in vivo in a genetic
mouse model. These data recommend pursuit of BH3-peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy in human
synovial sarcomas.

INTRODUCTION
Synovial sarcoma is a soft-tissue malignancy with a predilection for adolescents and young
adults [1]. Approximately half of patients diagnosed with synovial sarcoma will die from
disease, that portion much higher in those who present with or develop metastasis. Targeted
therapeutic strategies are both lacking and greatly needed.
Synovial sarcomas bear a characteristic chromosomal translocation between chromosomes
18 and X, generating a fusion oncogene comprised of the promoter and 5′ coding sequence
of SS18 (previously called SYT) through its tenth exon and the 3′ coding sequence of an
SSX gene, SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 [1]. Expression of the human SS18-SSX2 cDNA in
certain tissues induces synovial sarcomagenesis in mice [2, 3]. The fusion oncoprotein
functions as a bridge between ATF2, bound to cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) in the
promoters of target genes, and TLE1, which recruits histone deacetylase and the polycomb
group repressor complex, resulting in epigenetic gene silencing [4].

A high level of BCL2 is considered part of the definitional synovial sarcoma expression
signature [5]. Nearly all synovial sarcomas will stain for high levels of BCL2 by
immunohistochemistry [6, 7]. Although apoptosis pathways have not been thoroughly
investigated to define a tumor-specific role for BCL2 in synovial sarcoma, BCL2 is
suspected to contribute to resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies [8]. Anti-sense knockdown of BCL2 was previously noted to sensitize synovial sarcoma cells to doxorubicininduced apoptosis [9].
A new class of compounds antagonizes BCL2 family members more generally by
mimicking the BH3 domain, through which BCL2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w act to suppress
downstream activators of apoptosis [10]. ABT-263, an orally available BH3 domain
peptidomimetic was found to be safe and marginally effective against follicular cell
lymphoma and small cell lung cancer in phase I trials [11, 12]. A primary challenge to its
efficacy has been the tendency of cancers to up-regulate alternate anti-apoptotic genes,
unaffected by ABT-263. Specifically, MCL1 is the most common route of escape from
ABT-263, with BCL2A1 as another means of evasion [13, 14].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We show that the biology inherent to synovial sarcomagenesis suppresses these escape
routes, enabling tumor sensitivity to this new class of pharmaceuticals.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to investigate apoptotic pathway members in synovial sarcomas, we assembled a
list of genes directly involved in apoptosis by combining related Kegg pathway and Gene
Ontology gene lists and then dividing them into anti- and pro-apoptotic components
(Supplemental Table 1). We interrogated published and publicly available mouse synovial
sarcoma expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo, profiles GSE6461 and GSE14469 [2, 3],) using D-chip software (www.dichip.org) [15]
with an alpha of 0.05 as the criterion for stringency (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A).
While Bcl2 expression was elevated in tumors, more striking was the unusual balance of
apoptotic pathways, with up-regulation of many pro-apoptotic members and the consistent
down-regulation of Mcl1 (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A). Similar patterns were
confirmed by comparing 29 human synovial sarcomas from GSE20196 [16] to 5 human

mesenchymal stem cell control samples from GSE26272 [17] (Supplemental Figures 1B and
C). An additional analysis compared 16 human synovial sarcomas to 21 human malignant
fibrous histiocytomas (soft-tissue sarcomas without SS18-SSX expression) from the prior
study set GDS2763 [18]. In this tumor-to-tumor comparison, BCL2 had 2.7-fold higher
expression (t-test p = 0.0002) and MCL1 1.7-fold lower expression (p = 0.002) in the
synovial sarcomas.

The strong consistency of high BCL2 levels in synovial sarcomas prompted the hypothesis
that BCL2 expression is regulated by the SS18-SSX fusion oncogene. The promoter of the
BCL2 gene in both the human and mouse genomes bears a CRE with a conserved and
typical ATF binding sequence. Some genes with promoters bearing CREs have been shown
to be directly suppressed by SS18-SSX binding to the promoter via ATF2 and recruiting
TLE1 [4]. Such suppression, if active, would achieve downregulation, rather than the
upregulation of BCL2 noted in synovial sarcomas. In order to investigate the control exerted
by SS18-SSX2 on expression of BCL2, we performed both overexpression of SS18-SSX2 in
naive cells and knockdown of the fusion oncogene in synovial sarcoma cells. Mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) heterozygous for conditionally activatable SS18-SSX2 in the
Rosa26 locus were harvested from day 14.5 embryos, dissociated in trypsin, and plated in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cremediated recombination to activate SS18-SSX2 expression in these MEFs was achieved by
the application of 5 μM TATCre protein in DMEM [19]. When induced to express SS18SSX2, the MEFs showed increased levels of Bcl2 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) following reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR from total RNA harvested at 48 hours
(Fig. 1B). For the opposite experiment, thoracic cage tumors from our previously reported
mouse model of synovial sarcoma were harvested from 15-week-old mice, dissociated in
collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNase, then plated in DMEM with 10% FBS. Short
interfering RNA (siRNA) was applied using the Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Sigma)
as previously described [4, 20]. Bcl2 levels decrease in response to siRNA against SS18SSX2 transcripts versus scrambled siRNA controls in cells derived from mouse synovial
sarcomas (Fig. 1C and D). This suggests that the fusion oncoprotein promotes Bcl2
expression. For a human correlate, we used the SYO1 cell line, derived from a human
synovial sarcoma expressing SS18-SSX2, kindly provided by Akira Kawai (National Cancer
Center Hospital, Tokyo)[21]. Similar decrease in BCL2 expression was noted in the SYO1
cells upon siRNA directed against SS18-SSX2 (Fig. 2A and B). To determine whether or
not SS18-SSX2 and its repressor complex could be identified at the putative ATF2 binding
site in the BCL2 promoter cyclic AMP response element (CRE), we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in SYO1 cells using antibodies directed against each known
member of the complex, SS18-SSX2, ATF2, and TLE1 (Fig. 2C). This ChIP identified none
of these components bound to the BCL2 CRE (Fig. 2C and D). From these data we conclude
that BCL2 transcriptional regulation by SS18-SSX2 either uses a distinct mechanism or is
indirectly impacted by SS18-SSX2 suppressing another BCL suppressor.
Given the consistent downreglation of Mcl1/MCL1 in synovial sarcoma expression profiles
(Fig. 1A, Supplemental Figure 1B), we investigated the effects of SS18-SSX2 on this and
other members of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Specifically, levels of Bcl2a1a
decreased in MEFs following induction of the expression of SS18-SSX2 (Fig. 1B). Mcl1
levels also trended toward downregulation in that setting, but not significantly (Fig. 1B and
Supplemental Figure 2). In mouse synovial sarcoma cells, both Mcl1 and Bcl2a1a levels
increased markedly upon knock-down of SS18-SSX2 using siRNA (Fig. 1C and D).
Similarly, knockdown of SS18-SSX2 in the human SYO1 cell line produced increased
levels of both MCL1 and BCL2A1 (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the expression of both
MCL1 and BCL2A1 may be suppressed by the expression of SS18-SSX2 in the tumors.
However, the fact that the impact of SS18-SSX2 on the expression of Mcl1 in the MEFs was

not similarly significant suggests that the transcriptional regulation by SS18-SSX2 of Mcl1
must be context-dependent. In similar fashion, a change in SS18-SSX2 expression
demonstrated the opposite effect on Bcl-xL in the tumor and MEF settings, also displaying
context-dependence. Context-dependent transcriptional regulation fits well into the
paradigm of the known epigenetic mechanism of recruiting polycomb group proteins and
HDACs to the cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) of target genes.
Both MCL1 and BCL2A1 have conserved CREs with putative ATF binding sites (Fig. 2C).
In order to ascertain if these genes are directly suppressed by SS18-SSX2, we performed
ChIP in the SYO1 cells. Indeed, each known member of the suppressive complex was
identified as bound to the CRE in the promoters of both genes (Fig. 2C). Further, siRNA
directed against ATF2, the DNA-binding member of the complex, released the complex
from the CRE in each promoter (Fig. 2C). These data confirm MCL1 and BCL2A1 as novel
direct targets of SS18-SSX-driven repression in the synovial sarcoma context using ATF2
promoter binding.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Observing that BCL2 and MCL1 specifically have opposite responses to a change in the
expression level of SS18-SSX2 in synovial sarcoma cells, we asked whether either MCL1 or
BCL2 might play a role in indirectly regulating the expression of the other, as a negative
feedback loop for the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic pathway. In knock-down of either gene,
response of the other was modest at best in SYO1 cells (Fig. 2D). The observed modest
decrease in BCL2 expression following siRNA directed against MCL1 may have derived
from inadvertent suppression of SS18-SSX2 itself. No change in the non-targeted gene
expression was noted in another human cancer cell line, suggesting that these anti-apoptotic
genes may have some subtle relationship in the synovial sarcoma cells specifically. We also
observed that knock-down of either gene, or the combination did not discernibly change the
growth and proliferation of the SYO1 cells. This fits with prior observations that Genasense,
an antisense oligonucleotide pharmaceutical directed against BCL2, enhanced sensitivity to
doxorubicin, but was not cytotoxic or growth suppressive as a single agent [9]. There are
likely other anti-apoptotic genes that fill-in for BCL2’s downregulation, but MCL1 itself is
an unlikely candidate in these tumors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancers that have evaded BH3-domain peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy have primarily
utilized either MCL1 or BCL2A1 as means of avoiding apoptosis in the setting of drugantagonized BCL2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w [13, 14]. New appreciation that both MCL1 and
BCL2A1 are direct targets of SS18-SSX-driven suppression suggests that synovial sarcomas
might be susceptible to BH3-domain peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy. In order to test this
hypothesis, cells derived from our mouse model of synovial sarcoma were plated in 96-well
plates. One, two, or three days following the addition of varied concentrations of ABT-263
or DMSO vehicle, cells were washed and incubated with 5mg/mL Thiazolyl Blue
Tetrazolium Bromide (Sigma). Mouse synovial sarcoma cells were modestly sensitive to the
BH3-domain peptidomimetic, but only after 2 days (Fig. 3A). Because the most clinically
desirable effect of pharmacologic blockade of the anti-apoptotic members of the
mitochondrial pathway would be to enhance sensitivity to traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy, the concentrations of ABT-263 and doxorubicin were varied independently
in a similar proliferation assay. ABT-263 enhanced the growth-suppression of doxorubicin
at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3A).
To confirm that these quantitative assays were highlighting true changes in cytotoxicity,
rather than metabolic rate alone, cell counts of apparently adherent, viable cells were
performed one day following treatments, immediately prior to application of the MTT assay
reagents. Indeed, cell counts corroborated the suspicion that the quantitative proliferation

assay changes derived from cell growth and survival, not simply changes in metabolism
(Supplemental Fig. 3).

To rule out the possibility that the observed sensitivity to ABT-263 derived from nonspecific toxicity alone, MTT assays were performed simultaneously comparing the human
SYO1 synovial sarcoma cell line to five other human cancer cell lines, all treated with
identical dosing combinations (Fig. 3B). Response of any kind was discernible in only one
other cell line, and that only a partial response and only in combination with doxorubicin.
From this we concluded that the synovial sarcoma responsiveness to ABT-263 cannot be
attributed to nonspecific toxicity alone, but rather some targeted effect. With regard to the
interaction between ABT-263 and doxorubicin, it fell on the synergistic side of the
isobologram generated for each (Fig. 3C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next evaluated the expression of mitochondrial anti-apoptotic genes following
administration of ABT-263 or doxorubicin. The greater sensitivity of SYO1 cells to
ABT-263 required that a very low dose of ABT-263 be applied, in order to have cells
remaining after treatment from which RNA might be isolated. In cells that evaded the
cytotoxicity for a full day, expression of BCL2, MCL1 and BCL2A1 was elevated (Fig. 3D).
True to the epigenetic mechanism of SS18-SSX2-mediated gene suppression, neither MCL1
nor BCL2A1 completely loses the capacity to respond to other factors that control
expression. However, each is suppressed sufficiently to render the response in most cells
insufficient to support full evasion of apoptosis. The levels of BCL2A1 are so low in SYO1
cells, that even after tripling in expression, it remains 3 orders of magnitude lower in its
expression than BCL2 itself.

The natural history of mice expressing the human cDNA SS18-SSX2 in cells that express
Myf5-Cre includes consistent tumor formation by the age of 12 weeks. The most frequent
site of disease is the intercostals muscles of the thoracic cage, where 3 to 8 tumors are
typically detectable by that age. These then grow over the ensuing weeks. With approval of
the university institutional animal care and use committee, mice were treated beginning in
the thirteenth week with three-times weekly doses of either 2.5 μL/gram body mass DMSO
vehicle or the same with ABT-263 dissolved at the concentration of 20 μg/μL (for 50 mg/kg
dosing regimen) or 30 μg/μL (for 75 mg/kg dosing). Mice were euthanized at 15 weeks of
age. The thoracic cage of each mouse was dissected of all muscles but the intercostals.
Tumors identified grossly and confirmed by GFP fluorescence were counted, excised, and
weighed (Fig. 4A). Histology then confirmed that each mass measured matched the typical
appearance of a synovial sarcoma in this model (Fig. 4B). Experimental and control mice
from the same litters were used for the studies. As a single agent in this setting, ABT-263
reduced the number of tumors at the higher dose, and the total mass of tumors per mouse
thoracic cage at both doses compared to control vehicle (Fig. 4). ABT-263 is often dosed
orally in other mouse models, but could not be in these mice due to typically severe
kyphosis (a non-tumor phenotype of their genetic manipulation) affecting esophageal access.
Even accounting for enhanced bioavailability via the intraperitoneal administration, the
doses we used are much lower than the typical 75mg/kg body mass daily for three weeks.
Further, we did not observe any toxicity in other tissues from the doses used. One mouse in
the higher dose group became moribund before the last treatment, but this cannot strictly be
attributed to any drug toxicity, as this naturally occurs at a relatively high background rate in
these mice. Given the modest sensitivity of the cells derived from similar mouse synovial
sarcomas to ABT-263 as a single agent, this marked in vivo responsiveness suggests that the
drug may inhibit evasion of cell-to-cell or immune-mediated induction of apoptosis, rather
than cell intrinsic alone.

These data provide a molecular rationale for treatment of synovial sarcomas with this new
class of BH3-domain peptidomimetics. Further, they illustrate the capacity of a genetic
mouse model of a human cancer, not only as a platform for preclinical evaluation of
treatment strategies, but also as tool for deciphering pathways important in mediating their
molecular effects. Given the relatively small numbers of human synovial sarcomas treated at
any single referral sarcoma unit, there is an urgent need to develop molecularly targeted
therapies that have a high chance of efficacy in the clinic prior to initiating clinical trials. If
drugs or regimens and their biology can be credentialed in an in vivo synovial
sarcomagenesis model, therapeutic strategies may be prioritized; more effective clinical
trials may be performed.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Reanalysis of expression arrays from two previously published models of synovial
sarcoma in mice according to an anti-apoptotic gene list shows skeletal muscle control
samples (left) compared to synovial sarcomas induced by expression of SS18-SSX2 initiated
by two different promoters of Cre-recombinase, Myf5 and Rosa26 (5 each). Mcl1 represents
6 of the significantly down-regulated microarray probes. (B) E14.5 mouse embryonic
fibroblasts heterozygous for conditionally activated SS18-SSX2 were induced by exposure
to TATCre protein or control conditions in vitro. After 48 hours, this resulted in increased
Bcl2 expression and decreases in other BH3-domain genes by SYBR green quantitative
PCR from RT-PCR-generated cDNAs. Mcl1 down-regulation was not statistically
significant (p = 0.2, Student’s t-test). (C) Cells derived from mouse synovial sarcomas were
transfected with anti-SS18-SSX2 siRNA or control scrambled siRNA, achieving knockdown
of SS18-SSX2, downregulation of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL and upregulation of Mcl1, Bcl-w, and
Bcl2a1a, all measured by SYBR green qPCR from cDNAs generated from total RNA
procured 48 hours after application of siRNA. (D) Western confirms the same directional
changes in protein levels for SS18-SSX2, Bcl2, BclxL, and Mcl1 72 hours following siRNA
knockdown of SS18-SSX2 in mouse synovial sarcoma cells. Each experiment was
performed with a sample of at least 3 and independently repeated. (All charts depict mean

Figure 2. SS18-SSX2 in a human synovial sarcoma cell line also directly suppresses expression of
MCL1 and BCL2A1 and can be identified at their promoters

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) SYBR green qPCR of cDNAs made from total RNA isolated from the SYO-1 human
synovial sarcoma cell line 48 hours following siRNA directed against SS18-SSX2 or
scrambled control confirms downregulation of BCL2 and BCL-xL and upregulation of
MCL1, BCL2A1, and BCL-w (ATF3 is a “positive” control, known to be directly
suppressed by SS18-SSX2 in this cell line). (B) Western confirms the same directional
changes at the protein level, from extracts obtained 72 hours post-application of the siRNA.
(C) The ATF binding sequence in the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the promoters
of each of the genes in question shows perfect cross-species homology between mouse and
human. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with an antibody directed against
the SS18-SSX junction identifies that CRE bound at the MCL1 and BCL2A1 promoters, but
not at BCL2. Further, ChIP with an antibody directed against each of the members of the
expression-suppressing complex identifies each at the same promoters, but released from the
promoter 72 hours following siRNA directed against ATF2, the DNA-binding member of
the complex. Each experiment was performed with a sample of at least 3 and independently
repeated. (D) By 48 hours following application of siRNA directed against scrambled
control, BCL2, MCL1, or both BCL2 and MCL1, expression levels of targets were
confirmed to be knocked down in both SYO1 cells and the DLD.1 human colon cancer cell
line. No off target effects were noted in DLD.1 cells, but BCL2 was noted to be
downregulated upon application of siRNA against MCL1 in SYO1 cells. (All results are
presented as mean +/− standard deviation. All comparisons with p-values < 0.05 by
Student’s t-test are indicated with an asterisk.)

Figure 3. ABT-263 inhibits synovial sarcoma cell lines in vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Increasing concentrations of ABT-263 as a single agent modestly decrease proliferation/
survival of mouse synovial sarcoma cells in vitro as determined by a proliferation assay, but
only meaningfully by 2 days following application. Even nanomolar concentrations of
ABT-263 enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in these mouse synovial sarcoma cells.
(B) The SYO1 human synovial sarcoma cell line displayed marked sensitivity to nanomolar
concentrations of ABT-263 as single agent or in combination with doxorubicin in
proliferations assays performed 1 day after drug application. Side-by-side comparison to 5
other human cancer cell lines demonstrated their poor sensitivity to ABT-263 as a single
agent or in combination with doxorubicin, except for HCT116, a colon cancer cell line. (C)
Isobologram for 50% suppression of growth and proliferation of SYO1 cells after one day of
ABT-263 and/or doxorubicin and 70% suppression of mouse synovial sarcoma cells
demonstrate synergism between these drugs for both cell lines. (D) Most changes in gene
expression following application of doxorubicin or ABT-263 to SYO1 cells or mouse
synovial sarcoma cells are not significant. †While the expression of BCL2A1 increases
significantly following application of ABT-263 to SYO1 cells, it remains at a barely
detectable level. Each proliferation assay had a sample size of 8 in each drug concentration
at each time point following application, expression following drug applications had 6
replicates. All results are presented as means with standard deviation error bars. Asterisks
denote p-values < 0.05 by Student’s t-test.

Figure 4. ABT-263 inhibits synovial sarcoma in vivo in a genetic mouse model

Mice bearing conditional expression of the SS18-SSX2 human cDNA from the Rosa26
locus, activated by Myf5-Cre, develop synovial sarcomas most consistently in the intercostal
muscles of the thoracic cage, detectable by 12 weeks of age. (A) Mice treated with
intraperitoneal injection of either DMSO or DMSO with ABT-263 for three doses weekly
during weeks 13, 14, and 15 of life were euthanized at 15 weeks for visual and GFPfluorescence assessment of the thoracic cage (white arrows), followed by measurement of
the mass of the tumors themselves. (B) Histology confirmed the characteristic synovial
sarcoma appearance of each mass counted and weighed. (C) Treatment of mice with 75mg/
kg/dose (n = 5) of ABT-263 decreased the total number of thoracic cage masses identified
(by Student’s t-test). (D) Treatment with either 50mg/kg/dose (n=8) or the higher dose
resulted in statistically significant reduction of total tumor mass compared to vehicle control
(n = 7). All experimental mice derived from the same two parents, with controls and
treatment mice in each of the three litters used. All results are presented as means with
standard deviation error bars.
