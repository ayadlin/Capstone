FOXM1 has been implicated in taxane resistance, but the molecular mechanism involved remains elusive. In here, we show that
FOXM1 depletion can sensitize breast cancer cells and mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts into entering paclitaxel-induced senescence,
with the loss of clonogenic ability, and the induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and ﬂat cell morphology. We
also demonstrate that FOXM1 regulates the expression of the microtubulin-associated kinesin KIF20A at the transcriptional level
directly through a Forkhead response element (FHRE) in its promoter. Similar to FOXM1, KIF20A expression is downregulated by
paclitaxel in the sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells and deregulated in the paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7TaxR cells. KIF20A depletion
also renders MCF-7 and MCF-7TaxR cells more sensitive to paclitaxel-induced cellular senescence. Crucially, resembling paclitaxel
treatment, silencing of FOXM1 and KIF20A similarly promotes abnormal mitotic spindle morphology and chromosome alignment,
which have been shown to induce mitotic catastrophe-dependent senescence. The physiological relevance of the regulation of
KIF20A by FOXM1 is further highlighted by the strong and signiﬁcant correlations between FOXM1 and KIF20A expression in breast
cancer patient samples. Statistical analysis reveals that both FOXM1 and KIF20A protein and mRNA expression signiﬁcantly
associates with poor survival, consistent with a role of FOXM1 and KIF20A in paclitaxel action and resistance. Collectively, our
ﬁndings suggest that paclitaxel targets the FOXM1-KIF20A axis to drive abnormal mitotic spindle formation and mitotic catastrophe
and that deregulated FOXM1 and KIF20A expression may confer paclitaxel resistance. These ﬁndings provide insights into the
underlying mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance and have implications for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel
chemotherapeutic strategies for paclitaxel resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and a
leading cause of mortality worldwide. Paclitaxel (also known as
Taxol), together with docetaxel (Taxotere), belongs to the class of
chemotherapeutic drugs called taxanes. They are commonly used
as single agents or in combination with anthracyclines or
radiotherapy for the treatment of breast cancers, in particular
those not suitable for endocrine therapies as well as metastatic
diseases.1–3 The primary mechanism of action of the taxanes is the
disruption of microtubule (MT) dynamics through the stabilization
of GDP-bound tubulin in the MT, thereby interrupting the process
of cell division at mitosis. However, the efﬁciency of taxanes is
often hampered by their toxic side effects, their poor solubility
and the development of drug resistance in patients.4,5 In addition,
despite being one of the most widely used chemotherapeutics for
solid tumours, the exact mechanisms and the factors that govern
their anticancer functions are not completely understood.6
Cellular senescence is a tumour-suppressive phenomenon that
limits unrestricted cell proliferation and in doing so, prevents
cancer initiation and progression.7 Cells can be triggered to enter
premature senescence by stress signals, including irradiation,
persistent DNA damage response, oncogene activation, telomere
erosion, oxidative stress, toxins and stem cell reprogramming.7

Mitotic catastrophe is a tumour-suppressive mechanism triggered
during or after defective mitosis, culminating in senescence or
cell death distinct from apoptosis.8 Conversely, defective mitotic
catastrophe when coupled with mitotic slippage can promote
genetic instability and tumourigenesis.9
FOXM1 is a member of the Forkhead box (FOX) family of
transcription factors that share a characteristic winged-helix DNAbinding domain.10 It plays a central role in a variety of biological
processes, including cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, tissue regeneration and drug resistance. Additionally, FOXM1 is widely expressed in actively proliferating tissues
and plays a key role in oncogenesis. Recent evidence also
suggests FOXM1 can protect cells from genotoxic agent-induced
senescence by enhancing DNA repair.11,12 Consistently, FOXM1 is
overexpressed in genotoxic agent-resistant cancer cells.11,13
FOXM1 has been implicated in paclitaxel resistance but the exact
mechanism by which FOXM1 modulates the anticancer effects of
paclitaxel remains undeﬁned.
Kinesins (also known as KIFs) are a superfamily of molecular
motors engaged in key cellular functions including, mitosis,
migration and intracellular transport, through their interaction
with MTs.14–16 Kinesins are also believed to play a central role in
mitosis during cell division through modulating MT dynamics.17 In

Paclitaxel induces mitotic catastrophe via FOXM1

here, we study the involvement of FOXM1 in paclitaxel drug action
and resistance, and ﬁnd that FOXM1 regulates KIF20A expression
to modulate mitotic catastrophe, which has a role in paclitaxelmediated cell death and senescence.

with WT MEFs (Figure 2d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells after FOXM1 depletion (Supplementary Figure S3). Conversely, ectopic overexpression of FOXM1 in MCF-7 cells
augmented the expression of KIF20A (Figure 2e).

RESULTS
Deletion of FOXM1 inhibits cell viability and induces cellular
senescence in response to paclitaxel treatment
Our previous research implicated a role of FOXM1 in modulating
taxane sensitivity.18 To establish a role of FOXM1 in the response
to paclitaxel, we evaluated the long-term cell viability of early
passage wild-type (WT) and FoxM1−/− mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) by clonogenic assay upon treatment with a range of
concentrations of paclitaxel. The results showed that FoxM1−/−
MEFs were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to paclitaxel compared
with WT MEF cells (Figure 1a). To determine whether this loss of
long-term viability is due to cellular senescence, the WT and
FoxM1−/− MEFs were subjected to senescence-associated (SA) βgalactosidase (β-gal) staining. In agreement, the results indicated
that FOXM1 deletion in MEFs signiﬁcantly enhanced senescence
upon paclitaxel treatment, as revealed by their increased β-gal
staining and ﬂat cell morphology (Figure 1b).

FOXM1 enhances KIF20A promoter activity in MCF-7 cells
To determine whether FOXM1 is a direct upstream transcriptional
activator of KIF20A, we sought to clone the KIF20A promoter. We
initially cloned a 1.1 kbp region (−1150/ − 61) upstream of the
most 5’-transcription start site (designated +1 bp; Esembl
KIF20A-001 transcript) (Figure 3a). However, this 5’-UTR region of
KIF20A failed to demonstrate signiﬁcant responsiveness to
transactivation by FOXM1 in promoter/luciferase reporter assays
(Supplementary Figure S4). We thus next analysed the MCF-7
ChIP-Seq data (hg19: GSM1010769) from the Encyclopedia of DNA
Elements (ENCODE) project22 and identiﬁed strong FOXM1
occupancy at a region (−21/+144) mapped downstream of the
most 5’-transcription start site but upstream of a second
transcription start site (designated+163; Esembl KIF20A-002
transcript) (Figure 3a). Sequence analysis also identiﬁed a putative
forkhead responsive element (FHRE) (+80 bp) within this region
(Figure 3a). To determine whether FOXM1 directly binds to the
KIF20A promoter region, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in MCF-7 cells using speciﬁc primers (+8/
+133) to amplify the region containing the putative FHRE
(Figure 3b) and analysed FOXM1-binding using RT-qPCR. As
shown in Figure 3b (top left panel), the ChIP analysis showed that
overexpression of FOXM1 enhances the binding of FOXM1 to the
KIF20A promoter region. Conversely, the inhibition of FOXM1
binding by thiostrepton signiﬁcantly decreased the FOXM1
occupancy (Figure 3b, bottom left panel). To test whether FOXM1
can transactivate this KIF20A region through the FHRE, MCF-7 cells
were transiently co-transfected with a FOXM1 expression construct and a luciferase reporter gene under the control of either a
WT or a mutant (mut) KIF20A (0.3Kbp; − 134/+202 bp) sequence
(Figure 3a). The results showed that the WT KIF20A promoter
activity was signiﬁcantly augmented by FOXM1, whereas the
mutant (mut) KIF20A promoter was not transactivated by FOXM1
(Figure 3c), suggesting FOXM1 can activate KIF20A transcription
through this FHRE. Collectively, these results suggest that FOXM1
is able to bind and transactivate the KIF20A gene through the
FHRE located at position − 80 bp, providing strong indication that
FOXM1 is a direct upstream transcriptional regulator of KIF20A.

KIF20A and FOXM1 mRNA and protein display similar kinetics in
both MCF-7 and paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 TaxR cells following
paclitaxel treatment
The kinesin KIF20A has been shown to be a potential downstream
FOXM1 target required for normal spindle formation and
chromosome segregation.19 To explore a possible role of FOXM1
in paclitaxel resistance and the mechanism of action involved, we
investigated the expression levels of FOXM1 and its putative
target KIF20A in the breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells as well as the
paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 TaxR cells in response to paclitaxel
treatment. Western blot analysis showed that FOXM1 expression
was downregulated in the sensitive MCF-7 cells in response to
moderate levels of paclitaxel (10 nM), while the expression levels of
FOXM1 were maintained at high levels in the MCF-7 TaxR cells
upon paclitaxel treatment. Intriguingly, the expression of KIF20A
followed similar kinetics as FOXM1 upon paclitaxel treatment in
both cell lines, indicating a potential role for FOXM1 in modulating
paclitaxel sensitivity through KIF20A (Figure 2a; left panel,
Supplementary Figure S1). Consistently, RT-qPCR analysis revealed
that both FOXM1 and KIF20A mRNA levels were increased by two
to threefold in MCF-7 TaxR cells compared with the parental MCF-7
cells, which exhibited a reduction in KIF20A transcript levels
following paclitaxel treatment (Figure 2a; right panel). Together
these results suggest that FOXM1 regulates KIF20A to modulate
paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer.
Downregulation of FOXM1 decreases the levels of KIF20A, a
kinesin involved in mitotic progression
To determine whether KIF20A is a downstream target of FOXM1,
we proﬁled the expression of KIF20A by RT-qPCR and western blot
analysis after silencing FOXM1 using short interfering RNA (siRNA)
in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 and MCF-7 TaxR cells. The results
showed that depletion of FOXM1 culminated in the downregulation of KIF20A at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figures
2b and c, Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting FOXM1 regulates
KIF20A expression. Notably, both FOXM1 and KIF20A are induced
at the protein levels after paclitaxel treatment, which is likely
owing to the fact both proteins are upregulated at the posttranscriptional levels in mitotsis. Consistently, both FOXM1 and
KIF20A have been shown to be upregulated by mitotic inhibitors
at the post-translational levels.18,20,21 In agreement, KIF20A levels
were also detected at lower levels in FoxM1−/− MEFs compared

Low doses of paclitaxel cause aberrant mitosis in MCF-7 cells
To determine the cellular consequences of paclitaxel treatments,
MCF-7 cells were treated with a low dose of paclitaxel (5 nM) and
mitotic spindle formation was examined using α-tubulin antibodies to stain MTs, γ-tubulin antibodies to identify the
centrosomes and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain DNA.
Figure 4 (top panel) illustrates a typical untreated cell in mitosis
(metaphase), with a normal bipolar spindle. Figure 4 also (lower
panels) reveals various mitotic abnormalities, including abnormal
chromosome segregation, monopolar and multipolar spindles,
found in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells. Quantitative analysis of
mitotic cells stained with α-tubulin and γ-tubulin antibodies
(Figure 4) indicates that over 80% of paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells
exhibit abnormal mitotic spindles, with signiﬁcant increases in
cells with abnormal monopolar and multipolar spindles as well as
chromosome misalignment.
Depletion of FOXM1 or KIF20A causes abnormal mitotic spindle
formation and chromosome alignment defects in MCF-7 cells
To study the mitotic defects induced by loss of FOXM1 and
KIF20A, the subcellular distribution of α-tubulin and chromosomes
was examined in metaphase of MCF-7 cells after knockdown of

mitotic progression. Intriguingly, in the paclitaxel-treated MCF-7
cells, the increase in abnormal spindle formation after FOXM1 or
KIF20A silencing was no longer apparent. Consistent with previous
results, together these ﬁndings suggest that FOXM1 and KIF20A
modulate the cytostatic and cytotoxic function of paclitaxel
through regulation of mitotic spindle formation.
Depletion of KIF20A or FOXM1 inhibits cell growth and induces
senescence in MCF-7 cells
We next tested the effects of targeting FOXM1 and KIF20A in
MCF-7 and the paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 TaxR breast cancer cell
lines. To this end, cells were transfected with siRNA pools
targeting FOXM1 or KIF20A and their proliferation rates evaluated
by clonogenic assays. The results showed that FOXM1-knockdown
sensitized MCF-7 cells to long-term proliferative arrest at relatively
low paclitaxel doses (for example, 1 and 3 nM) (Figure 6a,
Oncogene (2016) 990 – 1002

Supplementary Figures S8 and S9). This notion is supported by
the analogous results from FoxM1-null ﬁbroblasts (Figure 1) and
the observation that ectopic FOXM1 expression conferred
paclitaxel resistance to MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure S10).
Similar to FOXM1 depletion, knockdown of KIF20A also sensitized
MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel at very low concentrations of the drug
(Figure 6a). In agreement with the clonogenic assay results,
FOXM1 or KIF20A knockdown sensitized MCF-7 cells to paclitaxelinduced senescence, as revealed by the accumulation of cells
displaying the SA β-gal activity and ﬂat cell morphology
(Figure 6b). Interestingly, knockdown of FOXM1 or KIF20A alone
almost completely abolished the colony-forming capacity of
MCF-7 TaxR cells irrespective of the dosage of paclitaxel used,
suggesting that MCF-7 TaxR cells are dependent on high
expression levels of FOXM1 and KIF20A for long-term clonal
survival (Figure 7a, Supplementary Figures S8 and S11). Depletion
of FOXM1 or KIF20A in MCF-7 TaxR cells signiﬁcantly induced the

Figure 6. Depletion of KIF20A or FOXM1 inhibits cell proliferation and induces senescence in MCF-7 cells. (a) MCF-7 cells were transfected with
either non-silencing control (NSC) siRNA, siRNA targeting FOXM1 or KIF20A. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 2000 cells were seeded in
six-well plates, treated with 0, 1 or 3 nM of paclitaxel, grown for 15 days, and then stained with crystal violet (left panel). The result (right panel)
represents an average of three independent experiments ± s.d. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by Student’s t-test, two-sided (*P ⩽ 0.05,
**P ⩽ 0.01, ***P ⩽ 0.005; n.s., non-signiﬁcant). In parallel, (b) MCF-7 transfected with NSC, FOXM1 or KIF20A siRNA were seeded in six-well
plates, treated with 0, 1 or 3 nM of paclitaxel. Five days after treatment, cells were stained for SAβ-gal activity. The graph shows the percentage
of SAβ-gal-positive cells as measured from ﬁve different ﬁelds from three independent experiments. Bars represent mean ± s.d. Statistical
signiﬁcance was determined by Student’s t-test, two-sided (*P ⩽ 0.05, **P ⩽ 0.01, ***P ⩽ 0.005, signiﬁcant; n.s., non-signiﬁcant).

Correlation between KIF20A and FOXM1 expression in breast
cancer samples
To establish further the physiological signiﬁcance and clinical
relevance of the regulation of KIF20A by FOXM1 in breast cancer,
FOXM1 and KIF20A expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 116 breast cancer patient samples (Figure 8a).
Immunohistochemical analysis results revealed FOXM1 expression
signiﬁcantly correlated with KIF20A expression (Pearson coefﬁcient r = 0.292, P = 0.006 for total KIF20A; r = 0.250, P = 0.019 for
cytoplasmic KIF20A; r = 0.228, P = 0.034 for nuclear KIF20A)
(Figure 8b). This further strengthened our ﬁnding in the cell lines
that FOXM1 directly regulates KIF20A transcription. Moreover,
survival analysis showed that nuclear KIF20A overexpression
signiﬁcantly associated with poorer survival (log-rank test,
P = 0.045 for overall survival and P = 0.016 for disease-speciﬁc
survival, respectively) (Figure 9a; Supplementary Figure S12).

On multivariate analysis, KIF20A nuclear staining remained
associated with poor survival after correcting for tumour stage
and lymph-node involvement (P = 0.047, relative risk = 2.47 for
overall survival and P = 0.037, relative risk = 2.767 for diseasespeciﬁc survival, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S12), supporting that KIF20A nuclear score is a prognostic marker
independent of the clinicopathological parameters examined. In
this cohort, 60% of patients received chemotherapy. For these
patients, elevated nuclear KIF20A was signiﬁcantly associated with
poor survival (log-rank test, P = 0.008 for overall survival and
P = 0.004 for disease-speciﬁc survival, respectively) (Figure 9b;
Supplementary Figure S13) and is an even stronger risk marker
(P = 0.013, relative risk = 4.008 for overall survival and P = 0.01,
relative risk = 5.089 for disease-speciﬁc survival, respectively)
(Supplementary Figure S13), suggesting that similar to FOXM1,11
KIF20A expression is associated with chemotherapeutic drug
resistance. The fact that only nuclear KIF20A is a reliable
prognostic marker suggests further post-translational mechanisms
modulate its nuclear oncogenic function. In agreement, further
analysis of KIF20A and FOXM1 transcript expression in a previously
published cohort (3455 breast cancer patients)24 revealed that
both high FOXM1 and KIF20A mRNA expression levels are very

signiﬁcantly associated with poor survival (P o0.00001 and
Po 0.00001, respectively, for overall survival, Kaplan–Meier
analysis) (Figure 9c). The signiﬁcance of both FOXM1 and KIF20A
in survival analyses provides further evidence for the involvement
of both genes in breast cancer progression and drug response.
DISCUSSION
Mitotic spindles are responsible for the proper distribution of
newly duplicated chromosomes to the two nascent daughter cells
during mitosis.25 The processes for spindle assembly and function
as well as sister chromatid segregation are modulated by MT
polarity and dynamics. MT stabilizers, including paclitaxel,
suppress MT dynamics and activate the mitotic checkpoint,
causing cell proliferation arrest and/or cell death. We found that
FOXM1 is overexpressed in paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 TaxR breast
cancer cell lines when compared with the parental sensitive
MCF-7 cells. FOXM1 expression is downregulated in response to
paclitaxel in MCF-7 cells, but remains persistently high in the
resistant cells following paclitaxel treatment. These data suggest
the possibility that FOXM1 is a target of paclitaxel and that it has a
role in mediating paclitaxel action and resistance. Consistent with
Oncogene (2016) 990 – 1002

this idea, we have shown previously that paclitaxel mediates its
cytotoxic functions through FOXO3a,26,27 which is an upstream
negative regulator of FOXM1 expression and activity.10,28,29
Interestingly, our data also reveal that in response to paclitaxel,
breast cancer cell lines undergo mitotic catastrophe, followed by
cellular senescence and/or non-apoptotic cell death. Crucially,
similar to paclitaxel treatment, FOXM1 depletion also induces
mitotic catastrophe, culminating in non-apoptotic cell death and
senescence. Consistent with this, previous studies also shows that
loss of FOXM1 can induce chromosome misalignment, centrosome ampliﬁcation and mitotic catastrophe.19,30
The assembly of mitotic spindle and the subsequent chromosome segregation are facilitated by MT-associated kinesins.17,31
These enzymes convert chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into
mechanical force production to mobilize MTs during mitosis.
KIF20A, also known as MKlP2 (mitotic kinesin-like protein 2) or
Rab6 kinesin, is a MT-associated motor protein of the kinesin-6
subfamily that regulates mitosis and cytokinesis.32,33 We found
that KIF20A is transcriptionally activated by FOXM1. In agreement,
depletion of FOXM1 by siRNA downregulates KIF20A expression
and paclitaxel downregulates FOXM1 and therefore, KIF20A
expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Our data also show

Figure 8. (a) FOXM1 and KIF20A expression was assessed by
immunohistochemistry using tissue-microarray constructed from
116 breast cancer patient samples. KIF20A was expressed in both
cytoplasm and nucleus. Representative staining images of one
patient with high FOXM1 and KIF20A expression and one with low
expression are shown. Positive correlation between FOXM1 and
KIF20A was observed. (b) KIF20A staining were detected in both
nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and were correlated with
FOXM1 staining. Statistical analysis revealed that all three KIF20A
scores (total, cytoplasmic and nuclear) were signiﬁcantly correlated
with FOXM1 expression. (P = 0.006, P = 0.019 and P = 0.034, respectively). P ⩽ 0.05, signiﬁcant; P ⩽ 0.01, very signiﬁcant; P ⩽ 0.005, very

that FOXM1 regulates KIF20A expression at the gene promoter
level via a FHRE. Interestingly, our gene promoter and ChIP
analyses reveal that this FHRE is located downstream of the most
5’-transcription start site, within the ﬁrst non-coding exon,
suggesting FOXM1 drives the transcription of KIF20A from this
alternative promoter region in breast cancer cells. This ﬁnding is
supported by a recent published global FOXM1 ChIP-sequence
analysis in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (hg19: GSM1010769) from
ENCODE project.22
Notably, the expression of KIF20A, like FOXM1, is downregulated in the drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells in response to
paclitaxel treatment, suggesting further that both FOXM1 and
KIF20A may mediate the paclitaxel action. Consistent with this
idea, we found that the normal spindle structure and chromosome
alignment were signiﬁcantly disrupted after the depletion of
KIF20A or FOXM1 using siRNA. However, the paclitaxel-induced
spindle abnormalities and chromosome misalignment defects are
not further enhanced by depletion of KIF20A or FOXM1, further
conﬁrming the idea that paclitaxel targets the FOXM1-KIF20A axis
to induce mitotic catastrophe. Interestingly, our data also show an
increase in mitotic catastrophe which can occur spontaneously in
some FOXM1- or KIF20A-depleted cells, resembling paclitaxel
treatment. This further suggests that paclitaxel mediates its
function through targeting FOXM1 and KIF20A. The spindle
assembly checkpoint monitors the correct attachment of MTs to
the kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the detection of
abnormal spindles by spindle assembly checkpoint will trigger

mitotic catastrophe.34 We therefore speculate that the overexpression of FOXM1 and KIF20A observed in the paclitaxelresistant cells counteracts the ability of paclitaxel to induce
abnormal spindles through their downregulation.
Our immunohistochemical and statistical analysis of breast
cancer patient samples shows that there is a signiﬁcant and strong
correlation between FOXM1 and KIF20A expression, further
conﬁrming the regulation of KIF20A by FOXM1 in vivo. Crucially,
like FOXM1,11 the overexpression of nuclear KIF20A (Figure 9) is
associated with poor prognosis in terms of overall and diseasespeciﬁc survival. As over half of these patients studied have
received chemotherapy in the forms of anthracyclins and
taxanes,11,35 the immunohistochemistry data also support the
idea that FOXM1 regulates KIF20A to modulate paclitaxel
resistance. In addition, these data also underscore the value of
FOXM1 and KIF20A as biomarkers for the prediction of breast
cancer chemotherapy sensitivity and patient survival. In summary,
our data suggest that paclitaxel targets FOXM1 to downregulate
kinesins such as KIF20A to interfere with the formation of the
normal mitotic spindle, thus inducing senescence-related cell
cycle arrest and cell death in these cells. The reason why depletion
of KIF20A leads to spindle defects remains unclear. However, a
recent study using a Xenopus egg cell free system shows that
KIF20A is required for the transport of the chromosomal
passenger complex, which in turn is implicated in the coordination
of chromosome segregation.33 Collectively, these data advocate
the idea that the FOXM1 may modulate paclitaxel sensitivity
through regulating the expression levels of kinesins, such as
KIF20A, involved in mitosis and cytokinesis.
Notably, while depletion of FOXM1 or KIF20A enhances the
ability of paclitaxel to induce cellular senescence in MCF-7 cells,
FOXM1 or KIF20A silencing can readily induce senescence in the
resistant MCF-7 TaxR cells. This implies that the resistant cells may
have become over-reliant on FOXM1 and KIF20A for their longterm survival and renewal. As a consequence, the induction of
abnormal spindle formation through FOXM1 and its downstream
target KIF20A, may represent a novel strategy for overriding
taxane resistance as well as for cancer treatment, as ensuing
aberrant mitosis will culminate in senescence and/or cell death.
Indeed, the thiazole antibiotics thiostrepton, which inhibits the
transcriptional activity of FOXM1, has been shown to speciﬁcally
target cancer cells and have lesser effects on non-cancerous
cells.36 A reversible speciﬁc small molecule inhibitor of KIF20A
called paprotrain [(Z)-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylonitrile]
has also been developed. In addition to paprotrain, a vaccine
against peptides derived from KIF20A has also been used in a
recent phase I immunotherapy clinical trial for advanced
pancreatic cancer.37 In line with our ﬁndings, cells treated with
paprotrain also accumulate at metaphase and anaphase and
display an increased percentage of monopolar as well as
multipolar spindles.38,39 Interestingly, paprotrain has also been
shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis and development, independent of its mitotic function.40
In summary, we identify KIF20A as a direct transcriptional target
of FOXM1, involved in paclitaxel action and resistance. We show
that paclitaxel targets the FOXM1-KIF20A axis to induce mitotic
catastrophe, and the deregulation of this axis may contribute to
taxane resistance. Our data also suggest that FOXM1 and KIF20A
can be useful predictive biomarkers, in addition to being
therapeutic targets for cancer treatment and for tackling taxane
resistance in cancer.

SAβ-gal assay. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of
approximately 20 000 cells/well before treatment with paclitaxel for 48 h.
After culture for a further 5 days, cells were ﬁxed and stained using a
Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit #9860 purchased from Cell
Signalling Technology (Beverley, MA, USA). Plates were incubated
overnight at 37 °C in a dry incubator (no CO2). Cells were then detected
for blue staining under a bright-ﬁeld microscope. The percentage of SAβgal-positive cells was calculated by counting the cells in ﬁve random ﬁelds.
Western blotting and antibodies. Western blotting was performed on
whole-cell extracts by lysing cells in buffer as previously described.11
The antibodies against FOXM1 (C-20)(Cat#sc-502), β-tubulin (H-235) (Cat#
sc-9104) and Cyclin B1 (Cat# sc-752) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The KIF20A antibody (ab104118) was
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The PARP (#9542) and Caspase7
(#9491) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (New
England Biolabs Ltd., Hitchin, UK). Primary antibodies were detected using
horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugates as
appropriate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized using the ECL
detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Pollards Wood, UK).
Quantitative real-time–PCR (qRT–PCR). Total RNA was extracted with the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Complementary DNA
generated by Superscript III reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) was analysed by qRT–PCR as described.35
Transcript levels were quantiﬁed using the standard curve method. The
following gene-speciﬁc primers were used: L19-sense: 5′-GCGGAAGG

LB2 buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8; 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA
+1X PI), centrifuged and resuspended in LB3 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, pH
8.0; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA; 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate and
0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine+ 1X PI). DNA was fragmented to an average size of
150–200 bp using Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ, USA). After sonication, Triton X-100 was added to a concentration of 1% and the mixture was
centrifuged. Five percent of each sample was taken as input.
Twenty microlitres of Dynabeads conjugated to Protein A (Invitrogen)
were pre-blocked by phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine
serum albumin and incubated with 4 μg of the indicated antibodies (antiFOXM1 antibody (sc-502x, Santa Cruz) and rabbit IgG control (X0903,
Dako). After overnight incubation with the antibodies, Dynabeads were
washed twice and incubated with 100 μl of chromatin samples prepared
previously for overnight at 4 °C. Dynabeads were subsequently washed in
RIPA buffer and TE buffer before incubation overnight in elution buffer (1%
SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) at 65 °C. After elution, supernatant was diluted with TE
buffer and incubated with RNAse (Invitrogen) and proteinase K (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. ChIP DNA was puriﬁed,
dissovled in deionized water and subject to quantitative real-time PCR
analysis. Data were presented as % Input using the following formula: %
Input = 100 × 2^(CT adjusted Input sample − CT immunoprecipitated
sample). The experiments were repeated at least twice. The primers used
are: 5′-TTCCTTACGCGGATTGGTAG-3′ (KIF20A sense) and 5′- AGCCGCAGAG
CACAACTC-3′ (KIF20A anti-sense); 5′-CCGCCTCCCTCTTAGCATAA-3′ and
5′-CAGGAAATTGCATCTCGGGG-3′ (Control; -898/-724).

Tissue microarray and immnohistochemistry
See Supplementary Methods and Materials

Staining scoring
The stained tissue microarray slides were scanned by ScanScope scanners
and individual stained tissue microarray spots were assessed in computer
screen with the use of Aperio’s image viewer, ImageScope. To avoid
subjectivity in evaluation, the intensities and percentages of the staining
were scored by two independent individuals in a semi-quantitative way as
previously described and average was taken.29,41 As KIF20A was detectable
in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, separate evaluation on cytoplasm
and nucleus was carried out. For each case, a ﬁnal score was obtained by
multiplying the score of intensity with the score of percentage, 12 being
the maximum ﬁnal score. The total score is the sum of cytoplasm and
nucleus scores.

Statistical analysis
All statistics were determined using SPSS 16.0 and Windows XP, Excel
(Imperial College, London, Software Shop, UK). The correlation between
FOXM1 and KIF20A expression in tissue microarray was assessed by bivariate Pearson Correlation analysis. The correlation between KIF20A
expression and patients’ survival was estimated by Kaplan–Meier estimation and compared by Log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was carried out
by Cox-regression model. Protein and mRNA expression levels were
compared by two-sided student t-tests.
