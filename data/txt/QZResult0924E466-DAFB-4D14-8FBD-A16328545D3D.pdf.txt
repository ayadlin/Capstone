Abstract
Activating mutations within fibroblast growth factor receptor
3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for
human skeletal dysplasias including achondroplasia and the
neonatal lethal syndromes, Thanatophoric Dysplasia (TD)
type I and II. Several of these same FGFR3 mutations have also
been identified somatically in human cancers, including
multiple myeloma, bladder carcinoma, and cervical cancer.
Based on reports that strongly activated mutants of FGFR3
such as the TDII (K650E) mutant signal preferentially from
within the secretory pathway, the inhibitory properties of
nordihydroguaiartic acid (NDGA), which blocks protein
transport through the Golgi, were investigated. NDGA was
able to inhibit FGFR3 autophosphorylation both in vitro and
in vivo. In addition, signaling molecules downstream of FGFR3
activation such as signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT)1, STAT3, and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) were inhibited by NDGA treatment. Using
HEK293 cells expressing activated FGFR3-TDII, together with
several multiple myeloma cell lines expressing activated forms
of FGFR3, NDGA generally resulted in a decrease in MAPK
activation by 1 hour, and resulted in increased apoptosis over
24 hours. The effects of NDGA on activated FGFR3 derivatives
targeted either to the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm
were also examined. These results suggest that inhibitory
small molecules such as NDGA that target a specific
subcellular compartment may be beneficial in the inhibition
of activated receptors such as FGFR3 that signal from the
same compartment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7362–70]

Introduction
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) represent important signal
transducers for the transmission of information across the cell
membrane, including 58 distinct receptors in 16 different families
of homologous proteins in humans (1, 2). The fibroblast growth
factor receptor (FGFR) family includes four closely related
receptors, designated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. All
FGFRs exhibit a cleaved NH2-terminal signal sequence that
directs the nascent protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
followed by three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains,
a membrane-spanning domain, and a split tyrosine kinase domain
(3, 4), and are activated by FGFs, a large family of some 20 related

growth factors (5–8). The ligand-binding specificity differs for each
FGFR family member, with alternative splicing of FGFR transcripts
resulting in further distinctions in ligand specificity accompanied
by altered biological properties (4, 9). FGFR activation controls an
array of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation,
migration, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Aberrant activation
of these receptors, often through gain-of-function mutations, is
associated with many developmental and skeletal disorders.
Mutational activation of FGFR3 is responsible for the relatively
common skeletal dwarfism, achondroplasia, due to the G380R
mutation within the transmembrane domain, whereas strong
activation by the mutation K650E within the kinase domain results
in the neonatal lethal syndrome, thanatophoric dyspasia (TD) type
II (10).
Aberrant signal transduction arising from expression of a
constitutively activated FGFR3 is also an important event in a
variety of human neoplasias, especially multiple myeloma and
bladder carcinoma (11–15). Multiple myeloma is typified by the
accumulation of secretory plasma cells in the bone marrow, which
exhibit low proliferation but an extended life span. A frequent
translocation observed in multiple myeloma, t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3),
involves the FGFR3 gene, and results in increased expression of
FGFR3 alleles (11, 12). This translocation occurs with an incidence
of f20% in multiple myeloma and places the FGFR3 gene located
at 4p16.3 in proximity with the 3¶ IgH enhancer at 14q32.3, leading
to significant FGFR3 overexpression (11). Furthermore, FGFR3
overexpression is often accompanied by mutational activation,
including the mutations Y373C and K650E, corresponding to
germline FGFR3 mutations that cause the lethal skeletal
syndromes TDI and TDII, respectively (10, 16). The aberrant
signaling of overexpressed, mutated FGFR3, acting in concert with
other dysregulated genes such as cyclin D1, c-maf, and MMSET,
evidently contributes to the increased proliferative potential of
B-cell myelomas (17). Mutational activation of FGFR3 has also been
reported in human bladder and cervical carcinomas (13–15),
including the mutations corresponding to R248C, S249C, G370C,
and K650E, previously identified as causing TDI or TDII (10, 16).
Several recent reports show that the high level of kinase activity
associated with the strongly activated FGFR3 mutants such as
TDII (K650E) leads to accumulation of immature/mannose-rich,
phosphorylated receptors in the ER. This can result in direct
recruitment of Jak1 and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 from the ER, as well as activation
of Erk1/2 from the ER through a FRS2-independent and
phospholipase C (PLC) g-independent pathway (18–20). Given
the ability of FGFR3 to signal from intracellular compartments
within the secretory pathway, we investigated the possible
inhibitory properties of a drug that specifically blocks ER/Golgi
transport. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a naturally occurring
polyhydroxyphenolic compound isolated from the creosote bush,

NDGA and FGFR3 Signaling

Larrea divaricatta, has been previously characterized as a lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor, as a strong antioxidant, and as an
inhibitor of protein transport from the ER to Golgi, leading to a
redistribution of Golgi proteins to the ER (21–24). NDGA has also
been shown to have effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
differentiation. Recently, it was shown to have potentially valuable
inhibitory effects against specific RTKs such as insulin-like growth
factor receptor (IGF-IR), HER2/neu, and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (25–28).
The experiments presented here explore the ability of NDGA to
inhibit signaling by activated FGFR3, including kinase activation
and downstream signaling associated with an activated receptor.
Given the ability of NDGA to inhibit other RTKs, and the ability
of NDGA to collapse the secretory compartment from which
activated FGFR3 is known to signal (18–20), we examined the
possibility that NDGA would be particularly effective against the
strongly activated FGFR3 mutant K650E. Indeed, NDGA was able to
inhibit activation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT1,
STAT3, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In addition,
NDGA increased apoptosis in cells expressing FGFR3-TDII, as
measured by poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. NDGA
was also able to increase apoptosis in the multiple myeloma cell
line KMS-18 that expresses high levels of FGFR3 G384D. To
examine possible therapeutic effects of NDGA, multiple myeloma–
derived cell lines were treated with FGF2 to activate FGFR3, and
the effects of NDGA treatment on downstream signaling pathways
were observed. The results are discussed with respect to other
therapeutic approaches for treatment of cancers presenting
overexpressed and/or mutated FGFR3.

Materials and Methods
FGFR constructs. The full-length wild-type (WT) and kinase active
(TDII:K650E) FGFR3 have been described previously (29). The membranelocalized kinase domain derivatives of FGFR3 have also been previously
described (30).
Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies were obtained from the following
sources: FGFR3 (C-15), STAT1 (E-23), STAT3 (C-20), h-tubulin (H-235) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 4G10 (antiphosphotyrosine) from Upstate
Biotechnology; Phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), Phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705; D3A7),
Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204; E-10), cleaved PARP (Asp214)
from Cell Signaling; MAPK (ERK1 + ERK2) from Zymed; and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) anti-mouse and HRP anti-rabbit from Amersham. Monoclonal antibody 10E6 was a gift from V. Malhotra Laboratory (University
of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse
(Sigma), rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit (Boehringer-Mannheim), NDGA,
and the poly (4:1 Glu, Tyr) peptide were obtained from Sigma. Zilueton was a
gift from Dr. Edward Dennis (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. HEK293 cells were grown in
DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at
37jC in 10% CO2. Cells (9  105) plated on 10-cm dishes were transfected
the next day with 2 Ag of DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation at 3%
CO2, as previously described (31, 32). After 18 to 20 h, cultures were moved
back into 10% CO2 for 4 to 6 h before starving in 0% DMEM or treating with
NDGA in 10% FBS DMEM overnight. Cultures that were starved overnight
were treated with NDGA at varying concentrations or time, as indicated in
figure legends. Cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and lysed in 1%
NP40 Lysis Buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 Ag/mL
aprotinin] or radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
1 mmol/L PMSF, and 10 Ag/mL aprotinin]. Total protein was measured by

www.aacrjournals.org

Bradford Assay or Lowry Assay. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with
antibody for 2 h at 4jC. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and
incubated for 2 h at 4jC. The immunoprecipitated samples were washed
thrice with Lysis Buffer, boiled 5 min in sample buffer, and separated by
10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore) and blocked in 3% milk/TBS/0.05% Tween 20 or 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA)/TBS/0.05% Tween 20 ( for anti-phosphotyrosine,
anti–phospho-STAT1, and anti–phospho-STAT3 blots). Membranes were
immunoblotted with antibodies at room temperature for 2 h or overnight at
4jC. After primary incubation, membranes were washed with TBS/0.05%
Tween 20 and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham)
or (Millipore). To reprobe with other antibodies, membranes were stripped
of bound antibodies in stripping buffer [100 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol,
2% SDS, and 62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)] and incubated for 1 h at 55jC.
In vitro kinase assays. FGFR3-TDII was immunoprecipitated from
500 Ag of total cell lysate per sample for 1.5 h at 4jC. Protein A-sepharose
beads were added for 2 h. After 3 washes with Lysis Buffer, samples were
washed once with Kinase Buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L
MnCl2, and 5 mmol/L MgCl2]. Immunoprecipitates were preincubated with
NDGA in Kinase Buffer for 15 min on ice before the addition of ATP and the
poly (4:1 Glu, Tyr) peptide and incubated at 37jC for 15 to 25 min.
Reactions were washed thrice with cold Lysis Buffer before adding sample
buffer. Proteins were separated by 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred
to Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting, except for 32P-labeled
samples in which the gels were dried and exposed to film or a phosphor
screen for use with a Phosphorimager.
Double label indirect immunofluorescence. HEK293 cells were seeded
onto Collagen type I–coated glass coverslips (BD Biosciences) and transfected as above. After starving overnight, cells were treated with 30 Amol/L
NDGA. At indicated time points, coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, and placed at 20jC in 50%
glycerol/PBS. Before staining, cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS. The cis-Golgi
was detected with monoclonal antibody 10E6 and fluorescein-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody. FGFR3 localization was detected with
rabbit polyclonal antibody FGFR3 (C-15) and rhodamine-conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody. The nuclei were visualized by Hoechst dye
added to the Rh secondary antibody mix. All antibodies were diluted in 3%
BSA/PBS, and incubations were performed at room temperature. Coverslips
were mounted on glass slides with 90% glycerol in 0.1 mol/L Tris (pH 8.5)
plus phenylenediamine and photographed using a Nikon Microphot-FXA
with a cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu C5810).
Multiple myeloma cell lines. The human multiple myeloma cell lines,
RPMI-8226, LP-1, KMS-18, and KMS-11, were a generous gift from Dr. Leslie
Thompson (University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA). They were grown in
RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and
pen/strep, and incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2. For FGF stimulation, 3  106
cells per 35-mm well were starved overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640.
NDGA was added to the cultures for 1 h at 37jC before simulating with 10
ng/mL FGF2 and 1 Ag/mL Heparin for 10 min at 37jC. Plates were put on
ice, and cells were collected, transferred to tubes, and spun down for 2 min
at 1 krpm. Cell pellets were washed once with PBS before the addition of
RIPA Lysis Buffer. Thirty micrograms of total lysate was separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting as described above. For
NDGA treatment of the KMS-18 and KMS-11 cell lines, 6  106 cells per
5-cm plate were incubated at 37jC with various concentrations of NDGA
for 1 h or overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation as described
above. Thirty micrograms of total lysate were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting.

Results
In vitro inhibition of FGFR3-TDII autophosphorylation by
NDGA. An activated FGFR3 clone containing the K650E mutation
(FGFR3-TDII) was transfected into HEK293 cells. After an overnight
starvation, the receptor was immunoprecipitated from the cell

lysate and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. In Fig. 1A, g-32P-ATP
was used in the kinase reactions after preincubating with NDGA for
15 minutes. The NDGA concentration of 0.5 Amol/L caused a
dramatic reduction in the autophosphorylation of FGFR3-TDII. In

Figure 1. In vitro kinase assays. FGFR3-TDII was transfected into HEK293
cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were starved overnight in
medium containing no serum. Cells were collected and lysed in 1% NP40 Lysis
Buffer. FGFR3-TDII was immunoprecipitated (IP ) from lysates as described in
Materials and Methods. Immunoprecipitates were preincubated with 0.1, 0.5,
or 5 Amol/L NDGA in Kinase Buffer for 15 min on ice before the addition of
ATP and incubation at 37jC for 15 min. Proteins were separated by 7.5%
SDS-PAGE. The kinase reactions in A were performed with 5 ACi [g-32P]-ATP
per sample. The gel was dried and exposed to film directly. The kinase
reactions in B and C were performed with 150 Amol/L ATP. The gels were
transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting (IB ) with
antiphosphotyrosine (4G10) antisera (top ). The membranes were stripped and
reprobed with FGFR3 antiserum (bottom ). Antibodies were detected by ECL.
D, kinase reactions were performed using FGFR3-TDII immunoprecipitates
obtained as in A, with 80 Ag/mL of the poly (4:1 Glu, Tyr; Sigma) peptide
substrate and increasing amounts of ATP (25, 50, 75, and 100 Amol/L) under
increasing NDGA concentrations (0, 5, and 10 Amol/L). The reactions were
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After staining, destaining, and drying, the gel was
visualized using a Phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Quantification of radioactive
bands was performed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).

Fig. 1B and C, the kinase reaction was performed in the absence of
hot ATP and the phosphotyrosine on the receptor was detected by
immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody. These results
suggest a direct interaction of NDGA with FGFR3. To address
if NDGA was inhibiting the ATP binding pocket of FGFR3-TDII,
in vitro kinase reactions were performed over a range of ATP
concentrations in the presence of the peptide substrate poly
(4:1 Glu, Tyr). The incorporation of 32P from [g-32P]-ATP into the
peptide was quantified and plotted (Fig. 1D). Increasing concentrations of ATP did not affect the K m at various concentrations of
NDGA, indicating the inhibitor NDGA is noncompetitive with ATP.
Additionally, the inhibition of FGFR3-TDII autophosphorylation
was independent of ATP over the same concentration range (data
not shown). This finding further supports the contention that
NDGA is noncompetitive with ATP.
NDGA reduces in vivo autophosphorylation of FGFR3. To
examine the in vivo effect of NDGA on the autophosphorylation of
FGFR3-TDII and WT FGFR3, transfected HEK293 cells were treated
with 40 Amol/L NDGA for 1 h. As seen in Fig. 2A, the NDGA is able
to reduce the autophosphorylation of both the WT and activated
receptor. In Fig. 2B, the time dependence of the NDGA incubations
was determined. A concentration of 30 Amol/L was able to begin to
inhibit the receptor autophosphorylation in only 5 min, and
phosphorylation was almost completely gone by 60 min. Next, we
tested a broad range of NDGA concentrations with 40 Amol/L
being the highest amount to examine the optimal effect. Figure 2C
shows f50% inhibition of FGFR3-TDII autophosphorylation with
10 Amol/L NDGA treatment. Also seen in Fig. 2C (bottom), there is
a decrease in the amount of the immature form of the FGFR3-TDII
receptor at 35 Amol/L NDGA. This is most likely due to the ability
of NDGA to block ER/Golgi transport. Total cell lysate was
examined for STAT1 activation in Fig. 2D. The phosphorylation
on Y701 of STAT1 caused by FGFR3-TDII is attenuated at the
20 Amol/L concentration of NDGA.
FGFR3 localization and Golgi breakdown with NDGA
treatment. Typically, the disassembly of the Golgi begins to occur
rapidly after only a few minutes of NDGA treatment and is
reversible (23). As seen in Fig. 3A, NDGA promoted the disassembly
of the Golgi in f15 min, whereas the subcellular localization of
FGFR3-TDII seemed to become more punctate in the cytoplasm
with increasing time. This may suggest that inhibition of the
autophosphorylation of FGFR3-TDII by NDGA observed in Fig. 2 is
due to the change in the receptor localization and/or the altered
interaction with downstream molecules. To examine this hypothesis, we expressed targeted kinase domains of activated FGFR3
(30) and treated the cells with NDGA for up to 1 hour. As seen in
Fig. 3B, the myrR3-TDII derivative, which is targeted to the plasma
membrane by a myristylation signal, exhibits membrane localization that is unaltered by NDGA treatment. Similarly, in Fig. 3C
the localization of the cytoR3-TDII derivative, targeted to the
cytoplasm by a nonfunctional myristylation signal, seems unaltered
with NDGA treatment.
NDGA reduction of FGFR3 downstream signaling. Next, we
examined the change in downstream signaling molecules that are
activated in the FGFR3 pathway. Previous work from our
laboratory has shown the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5
in response to FGFR3 activation (31, 32). Given the importance
of STAT activation in a variety of human malignancies (33), we
surveyed STAT1 and STAT3 for altered activation in response to
NDGA treatment. The phosphorylation of MAPK was also determined. In Fig. 4A, HEK293-transfected lysates were probed with

NDGA and FGFR3 Signaling

Figure 2. In vivo autophosphorylation of FGFR3. HEK293-transfected cells
were starved overnight before treatment with NDGA. Cells were collected and
lysed in 1% NP40 Lysis Buffer. A, FGFR3-TDII and FGFR3-WT–expressing
cells were treated with 40 Amol/L NDGA for 1 h. FGFR3 was immunoprecipitated
from lysates, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P
membrane for immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine (4G10; top ) and FGFR3
antisera (bottom ). Antibodies were detected by ECL. B, FGFR3-TDII–
expressing cells were treated with 30 Amol/L NDGA. Cells were collected and
lysed at the indicated times. Immunoprecipitations and immunuoblotting was
performed as in A. C, FGFR3-TDII expressing cells were treated with a range
of NDGA (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 Amol/L) for 1 h before collecting
in 1% NP40 Lysis Buffer. FGFR3-TDII was immunoprecipitated and
immunoblotted as in A. D, 35 Ag of total cell lysate from C were separated by
10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane
was first immunoblotted with anti–Phospho-STAT1 and then stripped and
reprobed for total STAT1.

phospho-specific antibodies for STAT1, STAT3, and MAPK. The
signaling from FGFR3-TDII was greatly attenuated in response to
NDGA. The low level of activation caused by the overexpression of
FGFR3 WT was also inhibited by 30 Amol/L NDGA in 5 minutes.
As seen in Fig. 4, there is an increase in phospho-MAPK at the
60-minute time points. This is consistent with the previous report
by Deshpande (34), which showed that the treatment of FL5.12
cells with NDGA led to an increase in activation of MAPKs.
In Fig. 4B, as a control for the inhibition of autophosphorylation of
FGFR3 by NDGA as seen above, FGFR3 was immunoprecipitated
from the lysate and examined for phosphotyrosine. Next, in Fig. 4C,
we examined the STAT1 activation in HEK293 cells transfected
with localized activated kinase domains of FGFR3. The phosphorylation on STAT1 caused by the expression of both myrR3-TDII and
cytoR3-TDII was inhibited by 5 minutes of NDGA treatment. This

would suggest that NDGA is able to block the signaling from an
activated receptor independent of its localization. Curiously, for
unknown reasons, significantly enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation
was observed in response to the cytoR3-TDII, although expression
of this FGFR3 derivative was previously shown to lack transforming
activity (30).
Zilueton, a LOX inhbitor, does not block FGFR3-TDII
autophosphorylation. To determine if the LOX enzyme inhibiting
activity of NDGA was important for its effect on FGFR signaling, we
examined another LOX inhibitor, Zileuton. Zileuton is a specific
5-LOX inhibitor, whereas NDGA is nonspecific (35, 36). As seen in
Fig. 5A, when Zilueton was added to HEK293 cells transfected with
FGFR3-TDII, there was no decrease in receptor autohosphorylation. Even with 30 Amol/L of Zilueton added for 1 hour, no change
was detected. As a control, a duplicated plate was treated with
10 Amol/L NDGA, which again shows a significant decrease in
FGFR3-TDII autophosphorylation. This would imply that the ability
of NDGA to inhibit LOX is not required to block FGFR signaling.
Overnight treatment with NDGA leads to increased apoptosis in FGFR3-TDII–expressing cells. The above experiments were
performed with very short term treatments of NDGA, <1 hour.
Next, we examined the effect of a 24-hour exposure of various
concentrations of NDGA on HEK293 FGFR3-TDII–transfected cells.
PARP is a zinc finger DNA-binding enzyme, which detects DNA
strand breaks and is activated at an intermediate stage of
apoptosis. During late-stage apoptosis, PARP is cleaved and
inactivated by the apoptotic proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7
(37). We examined the PARP cleavage in cell lysates treated with
NDGA to determine the extent of apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 5B,
there is a significant increase in PARP cleavage in FGFR3-TDII–
expressing cells as the concentration of NDGA is increased. Thus,
in addition to the ability of NDGA to inhibit FGFR3 signaling, it is
clearly able to increase cellular apoptosis.
NDGA increases apoptosis in a multiple myeloma cell line
with activated FGFR3. To examine the possible therapeutic effects
of NDGA for multiple myeloma, a lethal disease that is
characterized by the slow proliferation of malignant plasma cells
in the bone, we examined two multiple myeloma–derived cell lines
that express high levels of mutated FGFR3 for an increase in
apoptosis with NDGA treatment. As seen in Fig. 5C, there is an
increase in PARP cleavage in the KMS-18 cell line (FGFR3 G384D)
with overnight treatment of NDGA. In Fig. 5D, the same
concentrations of NDGA did not seem to have a similar effect on
the KMS-11 cell line (FGFR3 Y373C). This may indicate that NDGA
is effective only on a subset of activating mutations in FGFR3, for
example, kinase domain mutations but not extracellular domain
mutations such as Y373C. Resolution of this question will require
further detailed analysis.
NDGA blocks downstream signaling in multiple myeloma
cells. First, we examined the effect of NDGA on multiple myeloma
cell lines treated with FGF2 to activate the FGFR3 receptor. The
RPMI-8226 cell line contains ‘‘normal’’ levels of expression of WT
FGFR3, whereas the LP-1 cell line has higher levels of FGFR3
expression. The cells were starved overnight and NDGA was added
to the medium for 1 hour before stimulating the cells for 10
minutes by the addition of FGF2. As seen in Fig. 6A, there is a
significant decrease in MAPK activation with 30 Amol/L NDGA
treatment before stimulation, which would indicate that NDGA is
able to inhibit the activation of endogenous, WT FGFR3. Next, we
examined the effect of NDGA on MAPK activation in multiple
myeloma cell lines that express high levels of mutationally

activated FGFR3. As the concentration of NDGA increased with the
1-hour treatment of the KMS-18 cell line, the phosphorylation on
MAPK decreased in cell lysates (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that
NDGA is able to block signaling from FGFR3 that is activated by
ligand or mutation. However, there was no significant change in
MAPK activation with the same concentrations of NDGA in the
KMS-11 cell line as seen in Fig. 6C, which may be dependent on the
particular mutation of FGFR3; in the case of KMS-11, a Y373C
mutation that introduces an abnormal disulfide bond in the
extracellular domain.

Discussion
NDGA is a natural compound with an interesting history and
broad spectrum of biological properties. Initially isolated from the

creosote bush Larrea divaricatta, it was originally characterized as
a potent antioxidant and shown to selectively inhibit arachidonic
acid 5-LOX (38, 39), thereby leading to a reduction of inflammatory
pathways through decreased leukotriene and prostaglandin
synthesis. NDGA also shows profound effects on the secretory
pathway, reflected in its ability to block protein transport from the
ER to the Golgi apparatus, and to induce the redistribution of Golgi
proteins into the ER (22–24, 40). As a nonspecific inhibitor of
NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C, NDGA also disrupts the actin
cytoskeleton and exerts effects on cell adhesion (41, 42). Although
some reports indicate that NDGA treatment can inhibit apoptosis,
as in inhibition of CD95L-induced apoptosis of glioma cells (43),

NDGA and FGFR3 Signaling

Figure 4. Alteration of FGFR3 signaling. HEK293
cells were transfected with FGFR3-TDII and WT.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were
starved overnight. Plates were treated with 30 Amol/L
NDGA for the indicated times. Cells were collected and
lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer. A, duplicate sets of 40 Ag of
lysate were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred
to Immobilon-P membrane, and immunoblotted. The
first membrane was cut in half horizontally and the
top was probed with phospho-STAT1, STAT1, and
FGFR3 antisera, sequentially. The bottom was
immunoblotted with phospho-MAPK and MAPK. The
second membrane was immunoblotted with
phosph-STAT3 and STAT3 antisera. Membranes
were stripped of bound antibodies between
primary incubations. B, 200 Ag of lysate were
immunoprecipitaed with FGFR3 antiserum. Proteins
were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred
to Immobilon-P membrane for immmunoblotting with
antiphosphotyrosine (4G10; top ) and FGFR3 antisera
(bottom ). Antibodies were detected by ECL.
C, HEK293 cells were transfected with myrR3-TDII
and cytoR3-TDII. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
cells were starved overnight. Plates were treated
with 30 Amol/L NDGA for the indicated times. Cells
were collected and lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer. Thirty
micrograms of lysate were separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane,
and immunoblotted. The membrane was cut in
half horizontally and the top was probed with

The bottom was immunoblotted with FGFR3 antisera.

receptor 5/TRAIL-R2 expression, thereby sensitizing malignant
tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (47). More recently, NDGA
has been shown to directly inhibit activation of two RTKs, the
IGF-IR and the c-erbB2/HER2/neu receptor, resulting in decreased
cellular proliferation (25, 27, 48, 49).
NDGA is a component of ‘‘Chaparral,’’ a natural product
proposed several decades ago as a treatment for some cancers
but was removed from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
‘‘generally recognized as safe’’ list in 1970. Since then, NDGA, also
called masoprocol, received FDA approval for inclusion in a topical
cream Actinex, under FDA Application No. (NDA) 019940, for
treatment of actinic keratoses. Recent studies of its properties have
led to rekindled interest in its biochemical and chemotherapeutic
properties, as evidenced by an ongoing clinical trial, ‘‘Phase I Study
of NDGA in Patients With Nonmetastatic, Biochemically Relapsed
Prostate Cancer on Androgen Dependent Prostate Cancer (ADPC)’’
(UCSF-035510; ref. 48). Interestingly, different stereoisomers of
NDGA occur, and whether these differ with regard to their
biological properties has not been investigated. NDGA is found
naturally as a mixture of chiral compounds, including the meso

forms R,R-NDGA and S,S-NDGA, and the optically active form
S,R-NDGA. To fully understand the spectrum of various biological
activities exhibited by NDGA with regard to oncogenic RTKs such
as IFG-IR and HER2 (25, 27, 49), or FGFR3 examined here, it may be
desirable to synthesize chemically pure NDGA isomers for a
thorough examination of their biological properties.
Given the importance of FGFR3 activation in several human
cancers of clinical importance, it will be significant to determine
whether the inhibitory properties of NDGA toward other RTKs,
such as IGF-IR or HER2, apply to FGFR3. The activation of cellular signaling pathways by strongly activated mutants of FGFR3
such as the K650E mutant, responsible for TDII (10), or the
mutation K650M, responsible for Severe Achondroplasia with
Delayed Development and Acanthosis Nigricans (50), has been
shown to occur within the secretory compartment, as evidenced
by direct recruitment of Jak1 and STAT1 activation, and by Erk1/2
activation from the ER through FRS2a and PLCg-independent
pathways (18–20). Thus, the ability of NDGA to disrupt the
secretory compartment, acting together noncompetitively with
ATP and its previously shown inhibitory properties toward other

RTKs, suggests that it might be particularly effective against
FGFR3.
Indeed, in the experiments described here, we show that NDGA
exhibits strong inhibitory effects against FGFR3 kinase activity and
the activation of downstream signaling pathways. After expression

Figure 6. Downstream effect of NDGA on multiple myeloma cells. A, the
multiple myeloma cell lines RPMI 8226 and LP-1 were starved overnight in RPMI
1640 with 0% serum in 6-well dishes. Duplicate wells for each cell type were
preincubated with 0, 10, or 30 Amol/L NDGA for 1 h. Half the cells were then
treated with 10 ng/mL FGF2 and 1 Ag/mL Heparin for 10 min. Cells were
collected and lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer. Thirty micrograms of lysate were
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and
immunoblotted with (top ) phospho-p44/42 MAPK, MAPK (ERK1 + ERK2’
middle ), and FGFR3 antisera (bottom ), followed by ECL. The membrane was
stripped between each antibody incubation. KMS-18 cells (B) or KMS-11 cells
(C ) cells were treated for 1 h with 0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 Amol/L NDGA. Cells were
collected, treated, and immunoblotted as in A.

Figure 5. Induction of apoptosis by NDGA, and comparison with Zilueton,
another LOX inhibitor. A, HEK293-transfected cells were starved overnight
before treatment with Zilueton or NDGA. Cells were collected and lysed in 1%

separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane for
immmunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine (4G10; top ) and FGFR3 antisera
(bottom ). Antibodies were detected by ECL. The membrane was stripped
between each antibody incubation. B, apoptosis was assayed by PARP
cleavage in HEK293 cells transfected with FGFR3-TDII or pcDNA3 (mock ),
treated for 24 h with a concentration range of NDGA in 10% FBS medium. Cells
were collected and lysed in 1% NP40 Lysis Buffer. Thirty micrograms of lysate
were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and
immunoblotted with cleaved PARP (Asp214; top ), FGFR3 (middle ), and
h-tubulin antisera (bottom ), followed by ECL. The membrane was stripped
between each antibody incubation. KMS-18 (C ) or KMS-11 (D ) cells were

in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitation, the activated FGFR3
TDII mutant protein is directly inhibited when assayed for
autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, we show that although
NDGA directly inhibits FGFR3-TDII kinase activity, it acts noncompetitively with ATP using this cell-free assay. This mode of
inhibition resembles that of a structurally similar compound, AG
538, which was shown to inhibit IGF-IR and act noncompetitively
with ATP (51). This indicates that NDGA may be a specific inhibitor
toward FGFR3-TDII and other RTKs, rather than nonspecifically
inhibiting a wide range of kinases. When cell lysates were examined
for Tyr-phosphorylated FGFR3, a concentration of 30 Amol/L
NDGA began to show inhibition of receptor phosphorylation in
only 5 minutes, and receptor autophosphorylation was almost
completely eliminated by 60 minutes. In this assay, the effects of
NDGA were almost certainly the result of direct inhibition together
with indirect inhibitory effects, such as disruption of protein
secretion and collapse of the Golgi. This latter effect was clearly
visible by immunofluorescent staining of the Golgi using the cisGolgi marker 10E6. NDGA treatment also resulted in significantly
diminished activation of STAT1 and STAT3 by the FGFR3 TDII
mutant. Prior work shows that strongly activated mutants of
FGFR3 actually recruit Janus-activated kinase 1 directly to the ER,
leading to activation of STAT family members, which is not
disrupted by brefeldin A (BFA; refs. 18, 19). In our results reported
here, we found that NDGA, an agent previously shown to disrupt
the Golgi by mechanisms distinct from BFA (52), rapidly blocked
activation of STAT1 and STAT3. Although NDGA possesses strong
antioxidant activity, the effects of NDGA on FGFR3 activation and

signaling were not attributable solely to antioxidant activity, as
shown by the inability of a chemically unrelated antioxidant,
Zileuton, to affect FGFR3 activation. Using HEK293 cells expressing
FGFR3, we showed that NDGA significantly increases apoptosis for
cells expressing the activated TDII mutant and in the multiple
myeloma cell line KMS-18, as shown by PARP cleavage. Lastly,
using the multiple myeloma cell line LP-1 expressing FGFR3 WT,
we show that FGF-dependent signaling, as reflected in the
appearance of p-MAPK, is effectively blocked by NDGA treatment.
NDGA also reduces p-MAPK in the KMS-18 multiple myeloma cell
line expressing FGFR3 G384D.
Collectively, the results presented here indicate that NDGA,
acting most likely by multiple mechanisms, including direct
inhibition of kinase activity, disruption of the secretory pathway,
inhibition of downstream signaling pathways, and increased
apoptosis, possesses potentially beneficial attributes that merit
further investigation. This is particularly true for those cancers
