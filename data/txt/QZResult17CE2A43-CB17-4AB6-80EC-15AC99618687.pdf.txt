ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death which needs novel drugs
to improve patient outcomes. In this study, we examined the ability of YF-18, a novel
matrine derivative to inhibit the growth and migration of lung cancer cells. By cell
cycle analysis, wound healing and transwell assays, we found that YF-18 induced
G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibited migration of lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent
manner. Further results indicated that YF-18 inhibited cell proliferation and migration
through down-regulating Skp2 and up-regulating its substrates, p27 and E-cadherin.
Moreover, YF-18 inhibited A549-luciferase cell xenograft tumor growth in a dosedependent manner. The findings indicate that YF-18 bears therapeutic potentials for
lung cancer.

in many different types of cancers [5–9], including lung
cancer [10–14]. A growing body of evidence implicates
that Skp2 promotes tumorigenesis [15–19]. Skp2 exerts
its oncogenic functions via ubiquitination of tumor
suppressor proteins, such as p27 [20] and E-cadherin
[21]. Targeting Skp2 could induce cancer cell apoptosis
and suppress tumorigenesis [22, 23], while inhibition of
Skp2-mediated p27 and E-cadherin degradation leads
to cell cycle blockage and migration inhibition [24, 25].
Collectively, these studies suggest that targeting Skp2 is a
promising strategy for cancer therapy.
Matrine (Figure 1) is the main chemical ingredient
of Fufang Kushen injection which was approved by
Chinese FDA (CFDA) in 1995. As an anticancer drug,
Fufang Kushen injection could be used to treat non
small cell lung cancer and liver cancer in combination
with other anticancer drugs [26–31]. Owing to its
druggable advantages, such as favorable solubility,
flexibility structure and good safety profiles, matrine has

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
death, which has ranked first in men and second in women
in morbidity and mortality [1]. Currently, chemotherapy is
the main treatment for lung cancer, which has apparently
reached a plateau of effectiveness in improving survival
[2]. Although the survival of lung cancer patients has been
improved with the emergence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
[3, 4], there still comes with new issues, such as drug
resistance. It is still urgent to develop novel targeted drugs
to improve patient outcomes.
Skp2 (S-phase kinase associated protein 2) is a
component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase (Skp, Cullin,
F-box containing complex). Under normal physiological
conditions, Skp2 controls cell cycle progression and
cell survival by promoting the destruction of numerous
proteins (Supplementary Table 1). Compared with normal
tissues or cell lines, skp2 is found to be over-expressed

been considered as an ideal lead compound for further
modification [32–34]. In our previous study, we discovered
that introduction of double bond and naphthalene ring
at 14 site of matrine skeleton could largely increase its
anticancer activity. In the current study, we designed
and synthesized a new matrine derivative, YF-18 with a
naphthalen-1-ylmethylene group modification (Figure 1).
The mechanism of YF-18 on proliferation and migration
inhibition was investigated.

inhibited lung cancer cell colony forming activity (Figure
2B). To further define the proliferation inhibition by YF-18
on lung cancer cells, we conducted cell cycle analysis and
cell apoptosis assay in A549, H1975 and 95D cells. Cells
were treated with different concentrations of YF-18 for 24
hours and analyzed by FACS. The cell cycle analysis results
showed that YF-18 arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase in
A549, H1975 and 95D cells in a dose-dependent manner.
The percentage of G2/M phase in control of A549, H1975
and 95D cells was around 10%, 22% and 9%. With the
treatment of YF-18 (10 μM), the percentage of G2/M phase
increased to 30%, 48% and 24%, respectively (Figure 2C).
The cell apoptosis results revealed that YF-18 didn’t induce
cell apoptosis in A549, H1975 and 95D cells (Supplementary
Figure 1). Collectively, it can be inferred that YF-18
inhibited cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest not cell
death.

RESULTS
YF-18 inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation,
colony formation and arrests cell cycle at G2/M
phase
The synthesis and characterization of YF-18 was
described in supplementary information. To detect whether
YF-18 treatment inhibits cell growth in lung cancer cells,
MTT assays were performed in A549, H1975 and 95D cells
treated with different concentrations of YF-18 for indicated
times. The results showed that YF-18 potently inhibited cell
growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A).
The IC50 at 48 hours for A549, H1975 and 95D was 15 μM,
10 μM and 12 μM, respectively. Therefore, we used dose
of 10 μM in the following studies. Moreover, the colony
formation results demonstrated that YF-18 significantly

YF-18 inhibits cell migration in lung cancer cells
To analyze whether YF-18 could inhibit the motility
of lung cancer cells, we performed wound healing and
transwell assays. The wound healing results demonstrated
that YF-18 significantly decreased cell migration in A549,
H1975 and 95D cells (Figure 3A). Consistently, YF-18
treatment led to decreased penetration of lung cancer cells
from transwell assay (Figure 3B).

YF-18 down-regulates Skp2 and up-regulates
p27 and E-cadherin

demonstrates that Skp2 could mediate p27 and E-cadherin
degradation [35]. By western blotting and real time
PCR assays, we found that YF-18 down-regulated Skp2
at both the protein and mRNA levels in a dose- and
time-dependent manner in A549, H1975 and 95D lung
cancer cells (Figure 4B and 4C). Consistently, p27 and
E-cadherin were up-regulated in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 4B). Collectively, these results implied that YF18 could increase p27 and E-cadherin expression through
decreasing Skp2 expression.

To dissect the molecule mechanism underlying
YF-18 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and migration
inhibition, we performed western blot assays to detect
regulators involved in G2/M and cell migration. The
results demonstrated that p27 and E-cadherin were
dramatically increased upon YF-18 treatment in a dosedependent manner (Figure 4A). Accumulative evidence

YF-18 inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and
migration through down-regulating Skp2

showed that over-expression of Skp2 inversed YF-18induced G2/M arrest (Figure 5C). Upon YF-18 treatment,
the percentage of cells at G2/M phase transfected with
empty vector rose from 8% to 23%, while the percentage
of cells at G2/M phase transfected with Skp2 plasmid rose
from 9% to 17%. Skp2 over-expression decreased G2/M
accumulation induced by YF-18 with about 7%. Also, the
wound healing and transwell assays results demonstrated
that over-expression of Skp2 increased lung cancer cell
migration in both YF-18 treatment and vehicle control
and reversed cell migration inhibition by YF-18 treatment
(Figure 5D and 5E). Collectively, these results suggested
that YF-18 inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation and
migration through down-regulating Skp2.

To elucidate whether YF-18 exerts its anticancer
activity through down-regulating Skp2 in lung cancer
cells, A549-luciferase cells were transfected with Skp2
plasmid or empty vector as control and treated with YF18 or not for further experiments. The expression of Skp2,
p27 and E-cadherin was detected by western blotting
(Figure 5A). Subsequently, MTT, cell cycle, wound
healing, and transwell assays were conducted. We found
that over-expression of Skp2 could promote cell growth,
and also attenuate cell proliferation inhibition by YF-18
treatment (Figure 5B). The cell cycle analysis results

did not lead to body weight reduction while in vehicle

dramatically (Figure 6C). Tumor can be obviously found
in the dissected lung tissue of vehicle and matrine group,
while in YF-18 (40 mg/kg) group, tumor size decreased
dramatically (Figure 6D). Consistent with the results in

To evaluate the anti-lung cancer activity of YF-18
in vivo, A549-luciferase cells (1×106) were intravenously

Vehicle, YF-18 (20, 40 mg/kg), and matrine (40 mg/kg)
were intraperitoneally administrated every other day for 3

Skp2 in tumor samples (Figure 6F–6G). Western blotting
results revealed that YF-18 down-regulated Skp2 and upregulated p27 and E-cadherin in vivo (Figure 6H). We also
tested the adverse effects of YF-18. Compared with the
vehicle control, the results demonstrated that mice treated
with YF-18 had normal serum concentration of creatinine
(CR), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) (Figure 6I–6K). These results
inferred that YF-18 displayed favorable anti-tumor effect

regulating EMT process. Certainly, for future follow ups, we
would test the effects of YF-18 on lung cancer metastasis
in vivo and elucidate the role of EMT in YF-18 induced
metastasis inhibition.
In summary, we conclude that YF-18 inhibits cell
growth, induces G2/M cell cycle arrest, and suppresses
cell migration via down-regulating Skp2 in lung cancer
cells. Our results suggest that inhibiting Skp2 by YF-18
could be a potential effective approach to treat lung cancer.

DISCUSSION

Cell culture, cell proliferation and cell viability
assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Matrine, the main component of Sophora flavescens
Ait which is listed in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, has been
approved as an adjuvant drug for preventing cachexia in
China. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the quality
of life and immune function of cancer patients were largely
improved by combining standard therapies with the use of
matrine [36, 37]. Besides, it is well documented that matrine
can inhibit proliferation of a variety of cancer cells [38–40].
Therefore, matrine could be an ideal lead compound for
anticancer drug discovery. In this study, we synthesized a
new matrine derivative YF-18, and found that YF-18 could
potently inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in
vivo (Figure 2, Figure 6A-6B, 6D-6F). Interestingly, YF-18
exhibits slight side effect reflected by body weight loss and
ALT, AST and Cr detection (Figure 6C and 6I-6K). These
results implied that YF-18 displayed advantage in drug
safety and druggable potential.
Since Skp2 is firstly reported to be over-expressed
in lung cancer [41], more and more studies have been
involved to elucidate the role of Skp2 in lung cancer
progression. It is reported that Skp2 plays an oncogenic
role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer [11, 42–44].
High expression of Skp2 is clinically correlated with low
expression of p27, a tumor suppressor and critical regulator
of cell cycle. In this study, we found that YF-18 induced
G2/M arrest was correlated with p27 up-regulation via
down-regulating Skp2 (Figure 2C, Figure 4A-4B, Figure
5A, 5C). E-cadherin, which is a key regulator mediating
cell migration, is observed with a low expression in lung
cancer and negatively regulated by Skp2 [21]. Loss of
E-cadherin is considered as a hallmarker of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) [45]. In the early stagy of
EMT, cells expressed decreased E-cadherin and acquired
enhanced migration ability [46]. Thus, restoring E-cadherin
expression can inhibit cell migration and prevent EMT
initiation. In our study, we discovered that YF-18 could
restore E-cadherin expression and inhibit migration (Figure
3 and Figure 4A-4B). Further results indicated that YF-18
induced migration inhibition was correlated with downregulation of Skp2 (Figure 5A, 5D and 5E). Considering
the role of E-cadherin and migration on EMT, we speculate
that YF-18 might inhibit lung cancer cell metastasis through

The lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1975 were
purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection)
and cultured as described [47, 48]. Highly metastatic large
cell lung cancer line 95D was obtained from the Cell bank
of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The
cells (5000 cells per well) were plated in flat-bottomed
96-well micro plates. Sixteen hours after seeding, new
medium containing different concentrations of YF-18 or
solvent control (DMSO) was added. Cells were further
incubated for indicated times and incubated with MTT
for additional 2-4 hours. The plates were then assayed
by testing the absorbance at 490 nm. Cell viability was
estimated by trypan blue dye exclusion assay [49].

Clonogenic assay, cell cycle and apoptosis
analysis
For clonogenic assay, cells were suspended in 1
ml DMEM containing 0.3% low-melting-point agarose
(Amresco, Solon, OH) and 10% FBS, and plated on a
bottom layer containing 0.6% agarose and 10 μM YF-18 in
35 mm plates (1000 cells/plate). After 14 days of culture,
cells were stained with Giemsa and clones containing
more than 50 cells were counted. For cell cycle analysis,
cells were treated with YF-18 at different concentrations
for 24 hours, and DNA content was determined by PI
staining and flow cytometry analysis. For cell apoptosis,
cells were treated with YF-18 at 10 μM for 24 hours.
Externalization of phosphatidylserine was tested using an
Annexin V/PI Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) according to manufacturer’s instruction.

Wound-healing assay and in vitro migration
assay
For wound-healing assay, cells (5 × 105/well)
were seeded into six-well plates. Twenty-four hours
later, wounds were created in the cell monolayer using a
white micropipette tip. Fresh medium containing 10 μM
YF-18 was added and the healing process was followed
for the next 48 hours. For the transwell assay, transwell

inserts (6.5 mm diameter and 8 μm pore size; Corning
Inc., Corning, NY, USA) were rehydrated in advance
by adding serum-free medium for at least 1 hour. Cells
in serum-free medium were seeded (2 × 104 cells) into
the inserts (the upper chamber). Complete medium
containing serum was used as a chemoattractant in the
bottom chamber, and 10 μM YF-18 was added to inhibit
cell migration. After 24 hours of migration, cells in the
upper surface of the insert membrane were removed by
wiping with a cotton swab, and cells in the lower surface
were fixed with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and
counted by microscopy.

4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with secondary
antibodies for 90 min at 37 °C. Detection was achieved
with 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Zhongshan Golden
Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared and mounted as in
routine processing.

Murine models
The animal studies were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Institute of Zoology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. All animal studies were
conducted according to protocols approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of Zoology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. SCID/beige mice were
injected with A549-luciferase (A549-Luc) cells (1 × 106)
via tail vein, and 4 days later the mice were randomized
into 4 groups to receive treatment with intraperitoneal
injection of vehicle, matrine at 40 mg/kg, YF-18 at 20
and 40 mg/kg (n=6 for each group; once every two days
for 21 days). The mice were imaged by IVIS Spectrum
at day 21, and were euthanized by cervical dislocation
at day 30.

Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR
assays
For western blotting assay, cells were lysed in
RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors.
Proteins (20 μg) were subjected to 6–15% SDS-PAGE,
electrophoresed and transferred on to a nitrocellulose
membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in Trisbuffered saline, the membrane was washed and incubated
with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies and
detected using the Luminescent Image Analyser LSA
4000 (GE, Fairfield, CO, USA). To detect the mRNA
expression of related genes, qPCR was conducted with
SYBR™ Green Real time PCR Master Mix (Takara
Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The primers used for
quantitative RT-PCR are as follows: Skp2, forward,
5’-GCTGCTAAAGGTCTCTGGTGT-3’ and reverse,
5’-AGGCTTAGATTCTGCAACTTG-3’,
GAPDH,
forward, 5’-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3’ and
reverse, 5’-GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG-3’.

Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the mean ± SD.
Differences between data groups were evaluated for
significance using Student’s t-test of unpaired data. P
values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Plasmids and transfection
The coding sequence of Skp2 was cloned into the
pcDNA3.1-flag expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
California, USA), A549-luciferase cells were transfected
with 1 μg plasmids. And 48 hours later, the cells were
treated with or without YF-18 at 10 μM for indicated time
points. The cells were then harvested for cell proliferation,
cell cycle analysis, wound healing and transwell assays
or lysed for Western blotting to detect the expression of
Skp2, p27 and E-cadherin.
