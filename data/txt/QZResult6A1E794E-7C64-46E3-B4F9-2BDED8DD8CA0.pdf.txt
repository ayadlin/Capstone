ABSTRACT
Pharmacological inhibition of the cell cycle regulatory kinase Wee1 represents
a promising strategy to eliminate cancer cells. Wee1 inhibitors cooperate with
chemotherapeutics, e. g. nucleoside analogues, pushing malignant cells from S
phase towards premature mitosis and death. However, considerable toxicities are
observed in preclinical and clinical trials. A high proportion of tumor cells can be
distinguished from all other cells of a patient’s body by inactivating mutations in
the tumor suppressor p53. Here we set out to develop an approach for the selective
protection of p53-proficient cells against the cytotoxic effects of Wee1 inhibitors.
We pretreated such cells with Nutlin-3a, a prototype inhibitor of the p53-antagonist
Mdm2. The resulting transient cell cycle arrest effectively increased the survival of
cells that were subsequently treated with combinations of the Wee1 inhibitor MK1775 and/or the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine. In this constellation, Nutlin-3a
reduced caspase activation and diminished the phosphorylation of Histone 2AX, an
indicator of the DNA damage response. Both effects were strictly dependent on the
presence of p53. Moreover, Nutlin pre-treatment reduced the fraction of cells that
were undergoing premature mitosis in response to Wee1 inhibition. We conclude
that the pre-activation of p53 through Mdm2 antagonists serves as a viable option to
selectively protect p53-proficient cells against the cytotoxic effects of Wee1 inhibitors,
especially when combined with a nucleoside analogue. Thus, Mdm2 antagonists might
prove useful to avoid unwanted side effects of Wee1 inhibitors. On the other hand,
when a tumor contains wild type p53, care should be taken not to induce its activity
before applying Wee1 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) 1 and 2 [6, 7]while
the cell replicates its DNA (i. e. in S phase) [8]. This
suppression of CDKs ensures that the cell will first
complete the replication of the entire genome before
moving on to mitosis. Removing Wee1 by siRNA, or
inhibiting Wee1 by small compounds, results in the
premature onset of mitosis, thereby increasing cell death
[3, 4].
Wee1 inhibition can be regarded as a way to
exploit replicative stress for cancer treatment, as we
have reviewed recently [9]. Tumor cells often display
impaired abilities to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted
replication of their DNA. Further increasing this stress

Inhibitors of the kinase Wee1 are capable of
inducing cancer cell death with high efficiency, in
particular when combined with chemotherapeutics such
as nucleoside analogues [1] or platinum compounds [2].
In particular, the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 has been found
efficient to eliminate a number of cancer cell species [3,
4], and it is currently evaluated in numerous clinical trials
( [5] and 21 entries to clinicaltrial.gov).
Wee1 is a cell cycle regulatory kinase. It

situation represents a viable strategy of cancer therapy.
This can be achieved by classical chemotherapeutics, e.
g. nucleoside analogues. Representatives of this class
include gemcitabine (2’, 2’-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC),
an analogue of deoxycytidine. Gemcitabine inhibits
ribonucleotide reductase, thus leading to a shortage and
imbalance of available deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates.
Moreover, it is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA,
leading to torsional stress and replication fork stalling [10].
Interfering with the replication machinery is one example
of targeting tumor-supportive cellular machineries for
cancer treatment, as reviewed recently [11].
Wee1 inhibition and the consecutive activation
of CDK1 can exacerbate replicative stress by at least
three mechanisms. Firstly, we have recently identified
a mechanism that leads from Wee1 inhibition to the
inactivation of Chk1, a key enzyme required to re-enable
DNA replication in the context of replicative stress
[12]. Moreover, Wee1 inhibition increases nucleotide
consumption and thereby increases replicative stress [13].
On top of this, however, Wee1 inhibition, by enabling
premature CDK activity during S phase, promotes
mitosis despite the fact that their DNA is incompletely
replicated [1]. This will either disable the completion of
mitosis, resulting in catastrophic death, or otherwise lead
to the formation of two daughter cells with gross genetic
deletions, again precluding survival.
Despite the encouraging preclinical and clinical
findings, Wee1 inhibitors have not achieved clinical
approval yet. One of the problems faced when evaluating
these drug candidates consisted in the toxicity that limited
the amount of inhibitors that can be safely administered.
Such dose limiting toxicities include myelosuppression
and tachyarrhythmia [5]. In other words, a better
distinction between normal cells and the tumor cells in a
patient’s body is required, and the cytotoxic effects should
be limited to the tumor cells as much as possible.
The most frequent genetic difference between tumor
cells and normal cells consists in mutations within the gene
TP53, encoding the tumor suppressor and transcription
factor p53 [14]. When activated, e. g. by phosphorylation
through DNA damage-induced kinases, p53 induces the
expression of genes that induce cell cycle arrest in G1
or G2. Strong p53 activation, e. g. by excessive DNA
damage, can also induce cell death, most notably by
apoptosis [15]. More than 50% of all tumors, however,
carry an inactivating mutation in TP53. This typically
disables the encoded p53 protein from binding to its
cognate promoter sequences, precluding transactivation.
In these cases, pharmacological activation of p53 will only
pertain to normal cells but not to tumor cells.
p53 activity is kept under tight control by its
antagonist Mdm2. Mdm2 binds and inactivates p53, and
on top of this, it acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target p53
for proteasomal degradation. The synthesis of Mdm2 is
induced by p53, leading to a negative regulatory feedback
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

loop. Small molecule inhibitors have been developed to
bind Mdm2, precluding p53 from binding to the same site.
As a result, these drugs can be used to augment the levels
of active p53, even in the absence of DNA damage [16].
The prototype compound of this kind has been termed
Nutlin-3a [17], but several similar drug candidates have
been developed since and are currently under evaluation
in clinical studies [18].
While mostly regarded as an inhibitor of cell
survival, p53 can also be employed to protect cells. To
this end, Mdm2 inhibitors can be employed to activate
p53. We have first described the protective effect of
Mdm2 inhibition in the case of nucleoside analogues,
e. g. gemcitabine [19]. Since p53 arrests cells in G1 or
G2, few cells replicate their DNA upon p53 activation by
Mdm2 inhibitors, and nucleoside analogues can no longer
be incorporated into nascent DNA strands. As a result,
the cells become resistant to treatment with nucleoside
analogues. When both drugs are washed off, the cells can
resume proliferation with only short delays. An analogous
approach was used to achieve protection against taxanes,
i. e. drugs that target the mitotic spindle. Pre-treatment
with Nutlin-3a precludes cells from entering mitosis, the
most vulnerable phase of cells in the face of taxanes, and
it thus ensures cell survival [20]. The protective effect of
Mdm2 against mitotic inhibitors is active for several days
and can be further enhanced by rapamycin [21]. Thus, p53
activation can provide protection of p53-proficient cells
against specific classes of drugs. This strategy dates back
to the beginning of the millennium, when low-dose DNAdamaging agents provided protection against microtubuleactive drugs through p53 [22, 23], a principle termed
cyclotherapy [24].
Here we show that Mdm2 inactivation successfully
protects p53-proficient cells against the cytotoxic effects
of Wee1 inhibition. When p53 is pre-activated, Wee1
inhibitors alone or in combination with gemcitabine
no longer prevent long term proliferation and survival.
Mechanistically, p53-activation keeps cells from the
lethal premature mitosis that is otherwise induced by Wee1
inhibition.

RESULTS
Mdm2 inhibition allows cells to survive the
treatment with Wee1 inhibitor and/or gemcitabine
To assess whether pre-treatment with an Mdm2
inhibitor affects the survival of p53-proficient cells, we
first treated U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma, p53 wild
type) with Nutlin-3a, the prototype pharmacological
antagonist that binds to Mdm2 and precludes its interaction
with p53 [17]. After a 24 hrs incubation time, the cells
were treated with gemcitabine and/or the Wee1 inhibitor

(simply termed Nutlin from here on) as before. For each
drug, control experiments using the DMSO solvent were
performed in parallel. Subsequently, all drugs were washed

off, followed by further incubation in regular cell culture
media. For twelve days, the cell density was monitored
by transmission light microscopy and automated image
analysis (Fig. 1A). Gemcitabine alone did not lead to a
strong impairment of cell proliferation, and also Wee1i

alone only moderately prevented cell growth. When
applied together at the same concentrations, however, the
two drugs strongly reduced the appearance of proliferating
cells, essentially preventing the formation of a confluent
layer, confirming the synergy that was described before
[12, 25-28]. Strikingly, the pre-treatment with Nutlin
rescued the proliferation of cells that were treated with
Wee1i alone, and even more strongly reversed the effect
of Wee1i and gemcitabine in combination. Parallel
experiments were performed with the non-transformed
cell line MCF10A. Interestingly this cell line was largely
resistant to Wee1 inhibition. However, the cells responded
to Gemcitabine or the combination of Gemcitabine with
Wee1i, and in both cases, this effect was alleviated by
Nutlin. To define the role of p53 in the protection by
Nutlin, we employed HCT116 cells, a colon cancerderived cell line that had been engineered to either contain
or lack wild type p53 [36]. In the case of HCT116 p53+/+
cells, we observed that cell proliferation on treatment with
gemcitabine or Wee1i, and also upon co-treatment with
Wee1i, was strongly reduced. However, in combination
with Nutlin, we observed a rescue in cellular proliferation.
In HCT116 p53-/- cells, however, no such rescue by
Nutlin was observed. Thus, the protective effect of Nutlin
is p53-dependent. We conclude that pre-treatment with
Nutlin has an intense protective effect and allows cells to
survive the treatment with Wee1i, alone or in combination
with gemcitabine.
Next, we investigated whether Nutlin pre-treatment
also affects immediate cell viability when cells are exposed
to gemcitabine and/or Wee1i. To test this, we treated
U2OS cells as above, followed by a 72 hrs incubation and
a viability assay based on the determination of cellular
ATP levels by luciferase (Fig. 1B). All three drugs –
gemcitabine, Nutlin, and Wee1i – led to a reduction in
viability, presumably through a combination of cell death
and arrested proliferation. Wee1i, alone or in combination
with gemcitabine, reduced viability most strongly.
Importantly, however, Nutlin rescued the viability of
Wee1i-treated cells, with or without gemcitabine. Thus,
Nutlin pre-treatment strongly protects cells from the
induction of death by Wee1i.

immunoblot analysis; we also probed the phosphorylation
of Histone2AX (γH2AX), a hallmark of the DNA
damage response [31] (Fig. 2A). Wee1i induced PARP
cleavage as well as a strong accumulation of γH2AX
in the presence or absence of gemcitabine, as reported
previously [12]. Notably, however, both responses were
clearly reduced when the cells had been pre-treated with
Nutlin. Similar results were obtained when blocking
caspase activities by the cell-permeant pan caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting that γH2AX levels
represent the direct result of a DNA damage response,
not an indirect consequence of caspase activation. To
confirm the reduction in γH2AX independently, we
assessed its accumulation by immunofluorescence and
subsequent digital image analysis (Fig. 2B and 2C), as
described [32]. We observed the accumulation of γH2AX
upon treatment with gemcitabine and Wee1i, alone or in
combination. In each case, however, Nutlin pre-treatment
led to a highly significant reduction in the accumulation
of γH2AX. Finally, we assessed the activity of caspases in
cell lysates obtained from U2OS cells after drug treatment.
We observed increased activities in samples treated with
Wee1i, alone or and in combination with Gemcitabine;
again, however, this was rescued upon pre-treatment with
Nutlin (Fig. 2D; Suppl. Fig. 1). In control samples treated
with Z-VAD-FMK, no caspase activity was observed,
validating the assay. Taken together, Mdm2 inhibition
attenuates both the activation of caspases as well as DNA
response signaling upon inhibition of Wee1.

The presence of p53 is required for the protective
effect of Nutlin-3a against Wee1 inhibition
Mdm2 is mostly known for its impact on p53, but
additional activities of Mdm2 have been reported [33],
and some of them may be affected by Mdm2 antagonists
as well. To assess whether Nutlin antagonizes Wee1i
through p53, we first assessed whether it increases the
levels of p53 and the product of a target gene, CDKN1A/
p21 [34], in U2OS cells (Fig. 3A). As expected, Nutlin led
to the accumulation of p53 as well as p21. Importantly,
neither the subsequent treatment with gemcitabine nor
the exposure to Wee1i led to any gross changes in the
levels of p53 or p21 when cells had been pre-treated with
Nutlin. We did, however, observe the accumulation of p53
but not p21 when the cells were treated with gemcitabine
and/or Wee1i alone. This is in agreement with previous
analyses indicating that DNA damage (as observed by
γH2AX accumulation) during S phase stabilizes p53 but
nonetheless attenuates the induction of p21 [35]. In any
case, the effects of Nutlin on p53 levels and activity were
not compromised by gemcitabine and/or Wee1i.
To define the role of p53 in the negative impact of
Nutlin on γH2AX accumulation, we transfected U2OS
cells with siRNA to p53. This knockdown abolished the

Wee1i exerts its toxic effects, at least in part, by
inducing a DNA damage response [8, 13] and apoptosis
[29]. We therefore tested whether Nutlin pre-treatment
reduces any or both of these responses. U2OS cells
were pre-treated with Nutlin or the DMSO solvent,
followed by gemcitabine and/or Wee1i. Subsequently,
the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP),
a bona fide caspase substrate [30], was monitored by

influence of Nutlin on γH2AX (Fig. 3B), indicating that
the protective effective of Nutlin against Wee1i depends
on p53.
Next, we assessed the protective effect of Nutlin in a
system of isogenic cells that only differ in their p53 status.
HCT116 cells that either contained or lacked wild type p53
[36] were employed for this purpose. Again, these cells
were pre-treated with Nutlin, followed by gemcitabine
and/or Wee1i, and the accumulation of cleaved PARP as

well as γH2AX was assessed by immunoblot analysis
(Fig. 3C). In the case of cells containing wild type p53,
Nutlin prevented both caspase activity and the DNA
damage response, similar to U2OS cells. When TP53 had
been deleted, however, Nutlin did not influence any of
these responses. In conclusion, p53 is strictly required for
the protective effects of Nutlin against Wee1i. Thus, p53
activity is the principal mediator of this protection.

Nutlin-3a prevents the accumulation of cells
in premature mitosis when exposed to Wee1
inhibitor

but this was not affected by Nutlin.
Immunoblot analysis does not distinguish
between regular and premature mitosis. In order to find
out how Nutlin affects the accumulation of cells that
prematurely enter cell division, we treated U2OS cells
with combinations of the three drugs, followed by twodimensional flow cytometry, quantifying both the DNA
content and the amount of phosphorylated H3 in every
cell (Fig. 4D and 4E). Cells with a DNA content below
4N but a phospho-H3 content above the baseline were
considered prematurely mitotic. As expected, Wee1i
led to the accumulation of cells in premature mitosis,
especially when combined with gemcitabine. However,
this number was strongly reduced when pre-treating
the cells with Nutlin . We conclude that Nutlin prevents
premature mitosis in cells that are confronted with Wee1i,
alone or in combination with gemcitabine. We propose
that this mechanism is at least partially responsible for the
protection of Wee1i-treated cells against Nutlin.

Wee1 acts to prevent the premature onset of mitosis,
and its inhibition is known to trigger chromosome
condensation and cell division, even before the replication
of cellular DNA is complete. This condition – often
referred to as premature mitosis – leads to a catastrophic
situation and cell death [1]. Premature mitosis is even
further enhanced when Wee1 inhibitors are combined with
DNA-damaging agents, such as nucleoside analogues or
platinum compounds [12, 25, 26, 28]. On the other hand,
p53 often prevents even the entry of cells into S phase,
or otherwise acts to block the transition into mitosis [37].
We therefore tested whether Mdm2 inhibition and p53
activation might prevent premature mitosis when cells are
exposed to Wee1i. Firstly, we determined the amount of
U2OS cells actively synthesizing DNA upon pre-treatment
with Nutlin and/or subsequent treatment with Wee1i (Fig.
4A). Nutlin strongly reduced the number of cells in S
phase, as determined by the incorporation of the labeling
nucleoside analogue 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU)
andreported previously [19]. Notably, the treatment with
Wee1i also reduced the amount of EdU-incorporating
cells, presumably due to interruptions in S phase.
However, even in this situation, Nutlin further reduced
the percentage of DNA-synthesizing cells, arguing that
Nutlin keeps cells out of S phase regardless of subsequent
Wee1i treatment. And indeed, propidium iodide staining of
the cells revealed that Nutlinpretreated cells were largely
accumulating with a DNA content corresponding to G1
or G2/M, regardless of their subsequent treatment (Suppl.
Fig. 2).
Next, we compared the extent of entry into
mitosis when U2OS cells were treated with Wee1i and/
or gemcitabine, in the presence or absence of Nutlin
pre-treatment. Wee1i, alone or in combination with
gemcitabine, strongly augmented the accumulation of
Histone3 (H3) that was phosphorylated at Serine 10, a
marker of cells in mitosis [38] (Fig. 4B). Of note, however,
Nutlin pre-treatment reduced the phospho-H3 signal in all
combinations of Wee1i and gemcitabine. Thus, Nutlinpretreatment reduces the accumulation of mitotic cells upon
exposure to Wee1i.
Similar investigations were carried out in isogenic
HCT116 cells with or without p53. Again, these cells were
pre-treated with Nutlin, followed by gemcitabine and/or
Wee1i, and the accumulation of Histone 3 (H3) that was
phosphorylated at Serine 10 was assessed by immunoblot
analysis (Fig. 4C). As expected, Wee1i increased the
levels of phospho-H3, whereas Nutlin prevented this
accumulation. Importantly, however, this was only
observed in p53-proficient cells. When p53 was absent,
Wee1 inhibition still induced phospho-H3 accumulation,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DISCUSSION
According to our results, the pharmacological
inhibition of Mdm2 prevents the toxicity of a Wee1
inhibitor, in the presence or absence of the nucleoside
analogue gemcitabine. In agreement, the Mdm2-inhibitor
Nutlin prevents the accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX
and the activation of apoptosis in response to Wee1i.
As expected, this protective effect conferred by Nutlin
strictly requires the presence of p53. Mechanistically,
p53 diminishes the onset of premature mitosis by Wee1i
and/or gemcitabine. We propose that Nutlin, by inducing
the CDK inhibitor p21, interferes with G1-S transition
and thus prevents replicative stress in the first place. In
addition, p21 also attenuates CDK1 activity [39] and may
thereby diminish premature mitosis even in those cells that
nonetheless entered S phase (Fig. 5).
These observations are suggesting two major
conclusions. Firstly, the therapeutic effect of Wee1
inhibitors may be reduced or even abolished if wild type
p53 is activated prior to Wee1 inhibition. This not only
argues against the combination of Mdm2 inhibitors with
Wee1 inhibitors to treat p53-wildtype cancers. Rather,
p53 is activated by most DNA-damaging therapeutic
regimens, including irradiation and chemotherapy, e. g. by
platinum compounds, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating
agents, and many others [40]. When combining any of
these chemotherapeutics with Wee1 inhibitors, it appears
advisable to administer the Wee1 inhibitor before or at
least simultaneously with chemotherapy, but not shortly
after it. Otherwise, it is conceivable that the pre-activated
p53 will interfere with cell cycle progression and thus with
the efficacy of Wee1 inhibitors. In contrast, the presence
of wild type but not pre-activated p53 does not seem to
preclude the cytotoxic activity of a Wee1 inhibitor [41].
Notably, these considerations only applies to tumors that

retain wild type p53, thus in about 50% of all human
malignancies.
Secondly, our results suggest a strategy that may
ultimately help to prevent unwanted toxicities of Wee1
inhibitors. Such toxicities, e. g. myelosuppression and
tachyarrhythmia, have been reported [5] and may currently
limit the usefulness of this class of drugs, especially when
combining them with conventional chemotherapy, and
despite their highly promising anti-cancer activity in
preclinical models [2, 25, 26, 28, 42-47]. In those cases
where p53 is absent or mutant and thus unable to activate
its target genes, the administration of Nutlin or similar
Mdm2 inhibitors will not interfere with the efficacy of
Wee1 inhibitors against tumor cells, as exemplified by
p53-/- HCT116 cells in this study (Fig. 3B). However,
normal cells from such patients still contain wild type p53.
The reversible activation of p53 by an Mdm2 antagonist
can thus be expected to attenuate the toxic effects imposed
by Wee1 inhibitors on non-cancerous cells. Thus, besides

their use to eliminate cancer cells that contain wild type
p53 but hyperactive Mdm2, Mdm2-inhibitors may prove
useful as a means to prevent unwanted side effects of
Wee1 inhibitors.
Such a use of Mdm2 inhibitors for avoiding the
toxicities of cancer treatment is not limited to Wee1inhibitors. Rather, Nutlin and related compounds were
suggested to prevent the side effects of other anti-cancer
compounds. We have previously found that Nutlin also
acts to reduce the toxicities of nucleoside analogues in
p53-proficient cells [19], and similar protective effects
have been reported for taxanes[20, 48], HDAC inhibitors
[49], resveratrol, [50], and other chemotherapeutics
[51-56]. Furthermore, the protective effect of Mdm2inhibitors is to be expected for any compound that
affects cell survival predominantly in S or M phase.
This includes inhibitors of Chk1 [57] and ATR [58],
which increase replicative stress and promote premature
mitosis; when combined with platinum compounds and

Figure 5: Depiction of protective mechanisms triggered by Mdm2 inhibition. Gemcitabine halts progression through S phase

by interfering with DNA replication. In the presence of Wee1 inhibitors, hyperactive CDK1 triggers premature mitosis despite incomplete
DNA replication, usually resulting in cell death. When Mdm2 inhibitors activate p53 and thereby increase the levels of the CDK inhibitor
p21, the transition from G1 to S phase is inhibited. Moreover, CDK1 inhibition by p21 reduces premature entry in mitosis. Taken together,
pre-treatment of p53-proficient cells with an inhibitor of Mdm2 attenuates the cytotoxic effects of Wee1 inhibition. In the scheme, activators
of cell cycle progression are depicted in red, inhibitors of cell cycle progression in blue, and drugs in green. Arrows indicate activation,

anthracyclines, the same was observed for inhibitors of
MK2 [59]. Inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 in combination
was particularly effective [1, 45, 46] but faces the risk of
unacceptable toxicities, which may be ameliorated by pretreatment with Mdm2 inhibitors. Furthermore, substances
with predominant toxicity to cells in mitosis are no
longer limited to taxanes. Rather, tubulin stabilizers like
epothilones as well as signaling inhibitors that preclude
a smooth transition through mitosis, e. g. inhibitors of
aurora or polo-like kinases [60], also represent suitable
candidates for combination with Mdm2 antagonists, to
limit their toxicities to normal cells. All these approaches
would take advantage of the most commonly encountered
genetic difference between human malignancies and
non-transformed cells, i. e. a mutation in TP53, to tailor
therapeutic strategies specifically towards cancer cells
and away from other cells in a patient’s body. In this
way, it is expected that therapies will not only become
more tolerable to a patient, but that the maximum doses
of tumor-drugs can be augmented to increase therapeutic
efficacy.
As a word of caution, the side effects of Mdm2
antagonists need to be considered in these strategies as
well. At present, not much is known about how well such
antagonists are tolerated, but a dozen phase I studies with
Mdm2 antagonists have been registered (clinicaltrials.
gov). It is conceivable that Mdm2 inhibition may increase
the death of those cells that are particularly sensitive
towards p53 (an unwanted on-target effect). A recent study
on mice with a global but inducible genetic ablation of
Mdm2 revealed that such sensitive tissues not only involve
the bone marrow and the gut, but also the kidney [61].
However, an important difference between this model and
pharmacological antagonists is the transient nature of the
latter. While the genetic ablation of Mdm2 is complete
and permanent, pharmacological Mdm2-inhibitors can
abrogate Mdm2 activity to an extent that can be adapted to
the situation, and Mdm2 can quickly revert to normal p53
antagonism after discontinuing drug administration. The
impact of Nutlin alone on the survival was only moderate
in most cases of a panel of p53-proficient cell lines [62,
63]. Only in cells with high amplifications of the Mdm2
gene, cells appear to become addicted to this oncogene,
rendering them exquisitely sensitive to Nutlin [62]. Since
such amplifications are not present in normal cells, we
expect that toxicities of Mdm2-antagonizing drugs will be
manageable. The same is true for other reported effects of
Nutlin, such as DNA breakage [64]or endoreduplication
[65] in some cell lines. However, careful assessment of
ongoing clinical trials involving Mdm2 antagonists will be
required. This will then help to avoid unwanted toxicities
by adapting the drug doses and schedules, and possibly by
chemically modifying the drugs to reduce their impact on
p53-sensitive normal tissues. Moreover, the combination
of Mdm2 antagonists with Wee1 inhibitors will require
evaluation in animal models before being taken to the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

clinics.
Taken together, our results suggest that p53 is an
important determinant of how Wee1 inhibitors can be used
in the clinics. On the one hand, p53 activation in tumor
cells must be avoided to prevent negative drug interference
with Wee1 inhibitors when a tumor carries wild type p53.
On the other hand, however, in p53-mutant tumors, the
administration of an Mdm2 antagonist appears as a highly
promising opportunity to circumvent the toxicities of
Wee1 inhibitors and many other drugs that act in a cell
cycle specific manner.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culturing of human cell lines
U2OS (human osteosarcoma) and HCT116
(colorectal carcinoma) cells were cultured in DMEM and
McCoy’s, respectively,with 10% FCS, 200µM L-glutamine
and antibiotics – 50U/ml Penicillin and Streptomycin, and
10µg/ml Ciprofloxacin (Bayer). In addition, medium for
U2OS cells contained 20µg/ml Tetracycline. All media
and chemicals except Ciprofloxacin were from Invitrogen.
MCF10A (non-transformed breast epithelial) cells were
cultured in DMEM/F-12 with 5% horse serum (Sigma
H1138), 0.5µg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma H-0888),
0.1µg/ml cholera toxin (Sigma C-8052), 20ng/ml Human
EGF(Sigma E-9644), and 1:1000 Insulin (Sigma I-9278).

Preparation of whole cell lysates
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.6 x 105
cells per well) for the drug treatment. Cell lysates were
prepared on ice. The cells were scraped off into the
medium and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500xg for
3 min at 4°C, followed by one wash in PBS. The cells
were resuspended in 100µl RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton
X, 1% desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mMNaCl, 10 mM
EDTA, 20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.5, 100.000KIE Aprotinin)
freshly supplemented with 2M urea, 1mg/ml leupeptine/
aprotinine, 0.1M pepstatin A, 0.1M pefabloc. After 20
min of shaking at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged at
15,700xg for 10min. Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
was used to normalize the concentration of proteins in the
supernatant. The samples were then boiled with Laemmli
buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE.

Transfection of human cells
Using lipofectamine 2000, we carried out transient
transfection of U2OS cells with siRNA to knock-down
p53, and a corresponding control siRNA as a control.
Lipofectamine and siRNA were dissolved separately

in DMEM only (without FCS, or and antibiotics) and
incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. They were
then combined and incubated for another 20 min at RT.
In one well of a 6-well plate, 280,000 cells were seeded
in 1.6 mL DMEM with 10% FCS, and 400 μL of the
lipofectamine-siRNA mix was added drop-wise, followed
by a 48 hrs incubation.

DTT, Roche complete mini protease-inhibitor mix). They
were shock-frozen thrice in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged
at 15,000xg for 15 min at 4oC. 40µl of lysate per well in
a 96-well plate was distributed in triplicates. 10µl of AcDEVD-AMC substrate (working concentration 25µM)
(ALX-260-031 Enzo) was added to each sample. Caspase
activity was measured using a fluorometer (Synergy MX
267137) at excitation wavelength 380nm and emission
wavelength 460nm every 10 min for 4 hrs at 37oC.

Immunoblot analysis

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry

Blots on nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes were
stained with the following antibodies. Phosphorylated
Ser 139 H2AX (05-636, Millipore), PARP (9542, Cell
Signaling Technology), beta-Actin (ab6276-100, Abcam),
phospho-H3 Ser 10 (3377, Cell signaling), p53 (sc-126,
Santa Cruz Biotech), p21 (OP64, Calbiochem). Secondary
antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase H3 (ab1791,
Abcam) (Jackson Immunoresearch) were used for
chemiluminescent detection (Millipore).

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with
the drugs. After fixation in ethanol, the cells were washed
in wash solution (0.05% Triton-X in PBS), followed by
incubation in staining solution (2% FCS, 0.2% Triton-X in
PBS) with phospho-H3 antibody (3377, Cell signaling) for
2 hrs and then with secondary antibody (coupled to AlexaFluor 488) for one hour. Subsequently, the cells were
resuspended in 0.5 mg/ml RNAse A solution andincubated
for 30 min at 37°C. Directly before measurement,
propidium iodide (final concentration: 30 µg/ml) was
added. Samples were measured using the flow cytometer
Guava PCA-96 Base System (Millipore).

Immunofluorescence analysis
For immunofluorescence microscopy, the automated
microscope Pathway 855 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, United States) was used to read fluorescence
intensity in 96-well plates. For confocal microscopy,
the LSM 510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Germany) was used.
The cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton-X
in PBS for 15 min and blocking for 15 min using blocking
solution (3% BSA in PBS). The primary antibody to
phospho-H2AX (05-636, Millipore), diluted in blocking
solution, was added for 1 h, followed by incubation with a
secondary antibody (Alexa-Fluor 546) and Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen) diluted in blocking solution for 45 min.
For EdU staining, permeabilization was followed
by exposure to Click- iTEdU reaction cocktail (C10351,
Invitrogen) for 30 min. The cell nuclei were counterstained
with Hoechst 33342.
Images were captured and analyzed using the BD
Pathway software, wherein the region of interest (ROI),
in this case the cell nuclei, were defined by Hoechst
stain, and the average intensity of the antibody-coupled
fluorescence within each ROI was determined.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates or 24-well
plates, treated after 18-24 hrs, and the confluency of
the cells was measured using a Celigo cell cytometer
(Cyntellect; labeled as Day0). After 24 hrs, the medium
was replaced with fresh media; the confluency was
determined again (Day1); subsequent measurements were
made every 24 hrs and media was changed every 48 hrs.

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with white
walls and bottom and treated after 18-24 hrs. Cells
treated with DMSO in a concentration which responds to
the highest concentration of the drugs added were used
as a control. Remaining wells without cells were filled
with medium in order to obtain a value for background
luminescence. Each experiment was incubated for 72
hrs. For measuring the luminescence, the CellTiterGlo®Luminescence Cell Viability Assay (Promega) was
used. CellTiter-Glo®Reagent was added in a 1:1 ratio to
the cell culture medium in a well. The plate was placed
on an orbital shaker for 10 min for induction of cell lysis.
Subsequently, the luciferase signal was measured on a
LuminometerDLReady™Centro LB 960 reader.

Caspase activity assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.6 x 10 (to the
power of 5) cells per well) and treated with drugs. 24
hrs post-treatment, the cells were harvested (inclusive of
medium) and centrifuged at 1500xg for 5 min at 4oC. The
pelleted cells were resuspended in 250µl caspase lysis
buffer (1M Tris-HCl, 2mM MgCl2, 150mM NaCl, 10mM
