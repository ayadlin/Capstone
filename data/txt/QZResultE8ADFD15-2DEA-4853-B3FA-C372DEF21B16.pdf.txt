ABSTRACT
In spite of intensive research to improve treatment of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) more than half of all patients continue to develop a refractory disease. Therefore
there is need to improve AML treatment. The overexpression of the BCL-2 family
anti-apoptotic members, like BCL-2 or BCL-xL has been largely reported in lymphoid
tumors but also in AML and other tumors. To counteract the anti-apoptotic effect
of BCL-2, BH3 mimetics have been developed to target cancer cells. An increase in
activity of ERK1/2 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase has also been reported
in AML and might be targeted by MEK1/2 inhibitors. Hence, in the current work,
we investigated whether the association of a BH3 mimetic such ABT-263 and the
MEK1/2 inhibitor pimasertib (MEKI), was efficient to target AML cells. A synergistic
increasing of apoptosis was observed in AML cell lines and in primary cells without
affecting normal bone marrow cells. Such cooperation was confirmed on tumor
growth in a mouse xenograft model of AML. In addition we demonstrated that MEKI
sensitized the cells to apoptosis through its ability to promote a G1 cell cycle arrest.
So, this combination of a MAP Kinase pathway inhibitor and a BH3 mimetic could be
a promising strategy to improve the treatment of AML.

morbidity in these patients [5, 6]. Thus, there is a pressing
need for new therapeutic strategies for AML to be
developed.
Targeting anti-apoptotic proteins of the
BCL-2 family is one such potential therapeutic possibility.
These proteins play a key role in regulating apoptosis
at the mitochondrial level. They contain at least one of
the four BCL-2 homology domains (BH1, BH2, BH3
and BH4) and are divided into three groups: the antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xL or MCL-1
interacting with and inhibiting the two sub-classes of
pro-apoptotic proteins, the effectors BAX and BAK, and
the BH3-only proteins like BIM or BAD [7]. BAX and
BAK are activated when the pro-/anti-apoptotic balance

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the commonest
type of acute leukemia in adults, and is characterized by an
abnormal proliferation, without differentiation, of myeloid
precursors [1]. Currently, intensive chemotherapy is used
as induction treatment allowing complete remission rates
varying between 70 and 80% in patients younger than 60
years. However, most of these patients relapse and the
5-year survival ranges from only 30–40% [2]. Prognosis
is worst for elderly patients, partly due to unfavorable
cytogenetic abnormalities [3] and increasing frequency
of resistance mechanisms [4]. Moreover, aggressive
induction treatments have been associated with higher

is committed toward cell death, and are responsible for
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
followed by caspase activation [8]. A high expression level
of BCL-2, MCL-1 or BCL-xL has been reported in AML
and associated with poor prognosis [9–11].
The BCL-2 family proteins are frequently associated
with treatment resistance and are attractive targets for the
development of anti-cancer agents [12, 13]. ABT-737 is
a synthetic drug designed to mimic the BH3 domain of
BAD and is consequently an effective inhibitor of BCL2 and BCL-xL. We have previously demonstrated that
ABT-737 cooperates with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
towards BIM stabilization to increase apoptosis in chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) cells [14, 15].
BIM expression is highly regulated at the posttranslational level. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases
1/2 (ERK1/2) mediate BIM phosphorylation on serine 69,
promoting its degradation via the proteasome pathway
[16]. ERK1/2 kinases belong to the mitogen activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and are downstream
effectors of MEK1/2. An activation of the RAS/RAF/
MEK/ERK pathway has been observed in many tumors,
including AML, leading to the development of specific
inhibitors of this pathway [17–19]. Several studies
have reported that MEK inhibitors (MEKI) can induce
apoptosis through BIM accumulation [20–22].
Orally bioavailable MEKI and BH3 mimetics
are currently tested in clinical trials as single treatment
and we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of two of
these molecules used in combination, i. e. AS703026
(pimasertib) and ABT-263. We observed a synergistic
cooperation between drugs in AML cell lines in vitro and
in a xenograft model. The blockage in G1 phase induced
by MEKI, seems to be mandatory to improve apoptotic
response to ABT-263. The beneficial effect of MEKI/ABT263 association was confirmed in leukemic progenitors
cells from AML patients.

FLT3-ITD mutation is the best-known molecular
abnormality of AML, so we used two FLT-3-ITD positive
cell lines: MV-4–11 and MOLM-13. A synergistic effect
between MEKI and ABT-263 was also obtained on these
two specific cell liens (Figure 1C). Considering these
results, we choose to follow our investigations on HL-60,
THP-1 and U-937 cells

Expression of BCL2 family protein partially
depends on ERK1/2 phosphorylation
To investigate the heterogeneity in drug combination
responses we analyzed the expression of BCL-2
family proteins in the 3 different cell lines. Indeed, the
constitutive pro-/anti-apoptotic balance between the BCL2 family proteins differed between the 3 cell lines, with
high BCL-xL and PUMA expression in HL-60 and U-937
(Figure 2), but similar BCL-2 and BAX levels in the 3
cell lines. Furthermore, MCL-1, known as a resistance
factor to ABT-263, was highly expressed in U-937 but
also in the responsive HL-60 cells (Figure 2). MEKI
addition resulted in a dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
was accompanied by an increase in BIM protein content.
This BIM accumulation was not sufficient to induce the
cleavage/activation of caspase 3 by itself (Figure 2).
However, it increased the rate of caspase 3 cleavage when
the cells were treated with ABT-263 in HL-60 and THP-1
but not in U-937 cells. MEKI also induced a decrease in
PUMA level in U-937 but not in HL-60 while THP-1 did
not expressed PUMA, MCL-1 nor BCL-xL.

The synergistic cooperation between ABT263 and MEKI is partially linked to BIM
accumulation
To investigate the role of BIM accumulation in
the synergistic effect of the two drugs in THP-1 cells, we
developed a BIM-deficient THP-1 cell line by using RNA
interference (Figure 3A). Although responding to ABT-263 to
a lesser extent (about 50% less) than wild type THP-1, BIMdeficient cells synergistically responded to ABT-263 and
MEKI co-treatment (Figure 3B). (p = 0.001). Thus, if BIM
accumulation contributed to the cumulative drug-induced
apoptosis in THP-1 cells, it was not sufficient to explain the
synergistic cooperation between ABT-263 and MEKI.

RESULTS
ABT-263 and MEKI are synergistic in leukemic
cells lines
Three cell lines (HL-60, THP-1 and U-937 cells)
were used in this study as in vitro AML cell models, to
investigate the effect of ABT-263 and MEKI used in
combination. Both ABT-263 and MEKI produced a dosedependent inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure 1-A,
left column). However, unlike ABT-263, MEKI alone
did not induce apoptosis (Figure 1-A, right column). In
combination, we observed a synergistic effect to inhibit
cell proliferation in the 3 AML cell lines. Considering
induced-apoptosis, the synergistic effect was confirmed in
HL-60 (p = 0.0001) and THP-1 (p = 0.0003) and moderate
in U-937 cells (Figure 1B).

Apoptotic response to ABT-263 depends on the
blockage in G1 phase induced by MEKI
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade plays a
central role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation
or death. ERK1/2 involvement in the regulation of G1
to S phase transition has already been demonstrated [27,
28]. We observed that MEKI induced a G1 cycle block
in the THP-1 cell line (Figure 4A), whereas ABT-263
induced apoptosis through caspase 3 cleavage in G1 phase

(Supplementary Figure S1). When both molecules were
used in combination, the ABT-263-induced increase in
apoptosis was dependent on the block in G1 phase (Figure
4A). Such a MEKI-induced G1 block was not observed
in U-937 cells (Figure 4A). To support our results, we
investigated the effect of MEK inhibition on the expression
of two proteins involved in G1/S phase transition: p27kip1
and p21cip1. By western blot analysis, we observed a
p27kip1 accumulation in HL-60 and THP-1 but not in
U-937 cells and an increase in p21cip1, only expressed by
THP-1, after MEK inhibition. These results suggested that
the synergistic cooperation between ABT-263 and MEKI
relied on a MEKI ability to block cells in G1 phase. Thus,
we tested the ability of cycloheximide (CHX), a known G1
blocker [29], to cooperate with ABT-263. We confirmed
that CHX treatment induced a block in G1 phase in both
THP-1 and U-937 cells (Figure 5A). This was associated
with a dramatic increase in ABT-263-induced apoptosis
in both cell lines (Figure 5B). We also observed a positive
correlation between MEKI- or CHX-induced increase in

G1 arrest and ABT-263-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells
(Figure 5C, black squares). Such a correlation was verified
in U-937 cells treated by CHX while MEKI was not able to
increase the ABT-263 effect due to the absence of block in
G1 (Figure 5C, white diamonds). These results confirmed
the importance of a G1 cell cycle arrest to promote ABT263-induced apoptosis.

MEKI on primary leukemic cells
We verified the effect of these drugs on primary
normal (n = 6) and leukemic (n = 9) bone marrow MNC.
These were labelled with anti-CD34, anti-CD38 and
anti-CD123 (Supplementary Figure S2) and analyzed
by flow cytometry for their ability to bind annexin

MEKI or both in combination (Figure 6). As expected,
AML samples were enriched in CD34 expressing cells
(leukemic blast cells) as compared to normal bone

the rate of CD38- cells did not differ between normal
and leukemic samples, but leukemic CD34+/38– cells
were enriched for CD123+ cells (Figure 6A, p = 0.012),
as previously described for the so-called leukemic stem
cells [30]. MEKI alone was poorly pro-apoptotic in the
populations analyzed (Figure 6B). At 20 nM ABT-263
induced a weak apoptosis rate in CD34+ cells but not in
the CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ population. In comparison
to the untreated condition, the combination of MEKI and
ABT-263 induced a significant apoptosis in both CD34+
(p = 0.001) and CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ leukemic stem
cells (p = 0.045) (Figure 6B). Moreover, the apoptosis
rate induced by the drug combination was greater than the
addition of the separated effects of each drug meaning a
synergistic effect (p = 0.002 for CD38+, p = 0.005 for
CD38- and p = 0.047 for CD38-/CD123+). Under the
same conditions, no significant apoptosis was induced in
CD34+ normal bone marrow cells (Figure 6C).

in apoptosis induction in HL-60 and THP-1 cell lines but
not in U-937 cells. This heterogeneity in response rates
could be partly explained by the differential expression
of the BCL-2 family members or by the inability of the
MEKI to block the cell cycle in G1 phase in U-937 cells.
We need to take into account that AML is a heterogeneous
disease depending on many factors such as blast cells
number, lineage, genetic events and stromal environment.
The mutational status could also be take into account.
FLT3-ITD mutation is observed in 25% of AML. Here,
we showed that FLT-ITD mutation doesn’t modify MEKI
or ABT-263 responses. Despite this heterogeneity, we
confirmed the results on primary cells from AML patients
and observed a significant increase in apoptosis of
leukemic progenitors and stem cells while there was no
effect on normal cells.
We previously reported a synergistic cooperation
between a BH3 mimetic and BIM stabilization by TKI
in CML cells [14]. As compared to CML, in AML
cells BIM expression is regulated by post-translational
modifications, including its phosphorylation by
ERK1/2, resulting in its degradation by the proteasome
[16]. We thus wondered if ERK1/2 inhibition could
promote the ABT-263-induced apoptosis in AML
cells. As expected, MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a
significant decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation that
was associated with BIM accumulation. However,
this BIM accumulation did not result in caspase 3
cleavage by itself. When MEKI was associated with
the BH3 mimetic, the BIM accumulation was linked
to an increased apoptosis in only two of the three cell
lines tested. Moreover, RNA interference experiments
showed that the loss of BIM accumulation reduced
apoptotic rated but didn’t impair MEKI/ABT-263
cooperation. These results showed that while BIM
accumulation drive ABT-263-induced apoptosis, it is not
necessary for a synergistic cooperation between ABT263 and MEKI, suggesting that other mechanisms could
be involved. Konopleva et al. [22] have reported that
MEKI cooperates with ABT-737 to increase apoptosis
in the OCI-AML3 cell line, through MCL-1 downregulation and enhanced BIM binding to MCL-1. In our
work, we also observed a MEKI-induced MCL-1 down
regulation in U-937 but this was not associated with a
synergistic response to the combination treatment. In
parallel, no MCL-1 decrease was evidenced on HL60 and THP-1 cells which were deficient for MCL-1
(see Figure 2). This deficiency could explain the very
strong synergism observed in THP-1, however, those
cells were not more sensitive to ABT-263 alone than the
two others. And, in spite of a high MCL-1expression
in U-937, ABT-263-induced apoptosis was not weaker
than in HL-60 or THP-1 (Figure 2A). It is possible that
apoptosis mechanism was independent of BCL2 in
U-937 as recently reported [32]. Besides, MCL-1 was
also strongly expressed in HL-60 showing that it did

MEKI enhances the therapeutic efficacy of ABT263 in a murine model of human AML
To further validate the beneficial association
between MEKI and ABT-263, in vivo experiments were
performed. Drug effect was investigated on the growth
of tumour issued from HL-60 cell line subcutaneously
implanted in NSG mice. Mice were orally treated with
low doses of MEKI, ABT-263 or both in combination.
All mice were alive and in good fitness at the end of the
experiments after three weeks treatment. While each
inhibitor separately was unable to significantly decrease
the rate of tumour growth, their combination induced
a highly significant 27% decrease in growth rate (p <
0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) (Figure 7A). At the end of
the experiments, the weight of the tumours was decreased
by 21% in the combination treatment group (2.05+/–0.70g
versus 2.60+/–0.97g, p = 0.047, Student t test) as compared
to the vehicle group while no significant decrease was
observed in the single drug groups. Moreover, the drug
combination induced an increase in the frequency of
apoptotic cells inside the tumour as compared to vehicle
or individual drug treatment (Figure 7B). In parallel, we
observed that MEKI treatment alone or associated with
ABT-263 induced a decrease in the phosphor-ERK1/2
staining in vivo (Supplementary Figure S3).

DISCUSSION
We investigated the effect of the BH3 mimetic
ABT-263 used in combination with the MEK1/2 inhibitor
AS703026, also known as pimasertib, on AML cells. Both
molecules are currently being tested in clinical trials as
single drug, in phase II for ABT-263 (NCT00445198) [31]
and in phase II for AS703026 (Study NCT00957580).
In vitro, we observed in combination a synergistic effect

not interfere with the synergy. The discrepancy between
our work and the previous study [22] can be explained
by the different MEKI or types of cell lines used, and
suggests that mechanisms other than the pro-/antiapoptotic balance between the BCL-2 family members
are implicated in this synergy.
ERK1/2 involvement in G1/S transition has
been previously demonstrated (2728). In this study, we
confirmed that MEK1/2 inhibition promoted a G1 cell
cycle arrest in THP-1 cells that was associated with the
accumulation of two cell cycle inhibitors: p27kip1 and
p21cip1. In parallel, we showed that ABT-263 induced
apoptosis in G1 phase without affecting the cell cycle
distribution. Thus, by inducing a G1 block, MEKI could
facilitate the apoptotic response to ABT-263 treatment,
resulting in a synergistic cooperation. In U-937 cells that
were resistant to MEKI-inhibited cell cycle progression.
The cause of the MEKI inefficiency to block U-937 cells
in G1 phase is not known. When treating U-937 and THP1 cells with CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor known to
be able to arrest the cell cycle at the transition point in
G1 phase, we observed effective G1 arrest in both cell
lines, with a consequent synergistically cooperation
with ABT-263 to increase apoptosis. The CHX-induced
G1 block is higher in U-937 than in THP-1 and this
correlates with apoptotic response obtained after CHX/
ABT-263 treatment. This G1-dependant apoptosis does
not depend on p53 as the three cell lines we used in this
work were deficient for p53. These results highlight the
importance of the cell cycle phase besides the BCL-2
family member status for ABT-263 efficiency in inducing
apoptosis. The levels of expression or phosphorylation
of the BCL-2 family proteins could make them in a less
stable equilibrium during the G1 phase facilitating the
pro-apoptotic effect of ABT-263. Alternatively, the levels
of ROS in G1 cells as compared to S/G2M cells could
sensitize the cells to BCL-2 inhibition as described for
leukemic stem cells [33].
Interestingly, the combination of MEKI and very
low ABT-263 concentrations (20 nM) was effective
in inducing apoptosis in both leukemic blast (CD34+/
CD38+) and stem (CD34+/CD38–/CD123+) cells.
These results confirmed those previously described for
ABT-737 and PD0325901 or CI1040 [22]. Importantly,
the combination of MEKI and ABT-263, at the weak
concentrations we used here, was ineffective on normal
bone marrow CD34+ cells and could thus be a promising
therapeutic approach to target leukemic cells without
affecting normal bone marrow progenitor cells.
Consequently, in vivo experiments were performed
on a xenograft mouse model to test the cooperation
between both inhibitors. The drugs dosing with ABT-263
and MEKI was lower than in previous reports to avoid all
side effects and maintaining drugs concentration in the
range of specific inhibition of their targets [34–37]. Even
in these restricted conditions, the beneficial of the MEKI/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ABT-263 combination was evidenced on the growth of
a particularly study tumour model i.e. subcutaneous HL60 implant. This confirms that combining the specific
effects of each drugs can be envisaged in vivo at a dosing
lower than the efficient dose of each drug thus avoiding
the adverse effects observed when each were separately
used.
Despite the recent convincing demonstration of the
efficiency of a selective BCL2 inhibition by ABT-199
in AML cells [38], a strategy using combining therapy
with lower doses is probably the best way to overcome
resistance and avoid side effects
Our overall results show that ABT-263 is more
effective when used in combination therapies. A better
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the
resistance of the U-937 cell line could allow determining
which patients could benefit from such a therapeutic
strategy. However, among the primary AML cells
analyzed in this study, no sample was resistant in vitro to
the combination therapy. Considering these results, ABT263 and MEKI combination seems to be a very promising
strategy and should be proposed to treat AML patients in
a phase 2 study.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines
HL-60, THP-1, U-937, MV-4–11 and MOLM-13
cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, SaintAubain, France) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal
calf serum (FCS), 1 mM glutamine, 25 mM Hepes,
100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% v/v CO2 at
37°C. Exponentially growing cells were used in all
experiments.
Down-regulation of BIM expression was achieved
through lentiviral expression of siRNAs. THP-1 cells
were transduced with lentiviral vectors (C-shRNA and
BIM-shRNA) at a multiplicity of infection of 2 in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FCS and 8 μg/mL protamine
sulfate (Sigma, St Louis, MI). Transduction efficiency
was verified by testing the EGFP expression by flow
cytometry. After one week of culture, GFP-expressing
cells were sorted by flow cytometry using an Elite-EPICS
cell sorter (Beckman-Coulter, Villepinte, France). At the
time of the experiments, more than 95% of cells were
fluorescent [23].

Bone marrow samples
Bone marrow samples were obtained from
patients with AML and from non-hematological
patients (‘normal’) under informed consent obtained in

participants and data were analyzed anonymously. The
study was approved by the local Ethics at the University
of Bordeaux. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated

washed and suspended in culture medium in the presence
of the different drugs.

combination. Viable cells were evaluated on the basis
of their ATP content. The CellTiter-Glo® luminescent
viability assay (Promega, Madison, United-States)
was used according to the supplier’s instructions. The
bioluminescence was read using a Wallac 1420 Victor
luminometer.

Reagents

Western Blot

ABT-263 (Navitoclax®, Abbott) and AS703026
(Merck Serono) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals
LLC (Houston, TX, USA). ABT-263 was used at 200 nM
on cell lines and 20 nM on MNC. The AS703026 notated
MEKI on the text, was used at 1 μM. Stem α4B (Stem
Cell Technology, Grenoble, France), a cytokine cocktail
containing IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, EPO, TPO and SCF, was
used at 100 μL/mL. Cycloheximide (CHX) (Calbiochem,
Fontenay-sous-bois, France) was used at 3 μM.

After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Biorad, Marnesla-Coquette, France). Membranes were saturated with
5% (w/v) fat-free dry milk or 5% (w/v) bovine albumin
in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20
(Sigma). Membranes were then probed with primary
antibodies: mouse monoclonal for BCL-2 (Sigma), BCLxL (Santa Cruz Biotech.), and MCL-1 (BioLegend),
rabbit monoclonal for caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3,
phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/204), PUMA,
p27kip1 and p21cip1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc,
Danvers), and rabbit polyclonal for BAX (Santa Cruz),
BIM and Tubulin (Sigma). All antibodies were used at
a 1/1000 dilution. After secondary antibody labeling,
peroxidase activity was revealed using the Western
Lightning Plus-ECL kit (Perkin Elmer, Courtaboeuf,
France) and band intensity was quantified using a Kodak
Imager.

Apoptosis in cell lines
Apoptosis was detected by using DiOC6(3) (100
ng/mL) as a probe for mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP), as previously described [24]. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for
10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X100 for 10 min at 37°C, and post-fixed in 50%
methanol at 4°C for 10 min. They were then washed
and rehydrated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS,
labeled with a primary rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3
monoclonal antibody (Cell Signalling, Danvers, United
States) and a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled
with Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen,
Saint-Aubin, France) and stained for DNA content using
Violet Vibrant DyeCycle (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen).
Analysis was performed on a Navios cytometer
(Beckman Coulter) with red and violet excitations.
Cleaved caspase 3 was measured at 660 nm and DNA
content at 450 nm.

Mouse xenograft models
Two sets of experiments were conducted, each with
40 NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice [25].
Mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions
and experiments were performed in the “Service des
animaleries” of the University of Bordeaux in conformity
with the rules of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
committee (approval number 03455.01). In the first
series of experiment, 106 HL-60 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously. In the second one, 2x105 cells only were
injected. Tumour volume was measured and calculated
with the formula length x width2/2. When average tumour
size approximately reached 450 mm3 in the first set and
150 mm3 in the second one, the mice were randomized
into control and three treated groups, of ten mice each.
Mice were administered by oral gavages using a stomach
tube with vehicle control (DMSO), ABT-263 (1mg/kg),
MEKI (0,2mg/kg) or both. Mice were treated five days
a week during three weeks. Tumour size was measured
twice a week. At the end of the experiments, mice were
sacrified by cervical dislocation and tumour was excised
and weighted. The tumour growth was calculated in
mm3/days as the slope of the regression line of the size
of the tumour as a function of the duration of treatment
for each mice. Both series of experiments were pooled in
the statistical analysis and the significance between the
treated and control groups were analyzed using the MannWhitney test using the Medcalc software.

Apoptosis in primary bone marrow cells
After a 24-h incubation with the indicated drugs,
MNC from AML patient or normal bone marrows were
labeled with anti-CD34-APC, anti-CD38-PC5, antiCD123-PE and Annexin V-FITC. Samples were analyzed
by multivariate flow cytometry (Navios, Beckman
Coulter). Percentages of annexin V-positive cells were
quantified on the gated CD34+/CD38+ or CD34+/CD38or CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ cells, and considered as
apoptotic.

Cell proliferation
Cells were seeded at 25,000 per well in a 96well plate and cultured for 3 days with increasing
concentrations of MEKI, ABT-263 or both, in

Apotosis and ERK1/2 activity in Xenograft
models

Kelly Airiau received a grant from the French
Ministry of Research.

Pieces of the tumours were fixed for 12 h in
3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, followed by 48 h in 70%
Ethanol. Standard histological processing and paraffin
embedding were done. Sections of 3 μm thickness
from paraffin-embedded tissues (PET) were heated to
56°C, rehydrated, washed and treated with TE (Tris 10
mM, EDTA 1 mM pH9) 30 min at 98°C for antigen
retrieval. Endogenous peroxidases were inhibited with
3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) in H2O for 5 min. Non
specific sites and avidin were blocked with buffers from
kit PK-7200 and SP-2001 from Vector laboratories (CA,
USA). Slides were incubated with primary anti-Active
caspase3 1:300 (AF835 R&D Systems Minneapolis,
MN, USA) or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling)
for 1 hour followed by 30 min incubation at room
temperature with biotinylated secondary antibodies
(SP-2001 Vector Laboratories) and revealed by an
additional 10 min incubation with Novared (SK-4800
Vector Laboratories). Slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted with Eukittmounting medium (Labonord).

All experiments on cell lines were performed in
triplicate and results expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD). The paired Student’s t-test was used to
analyze the data. Considering the elevated spontaneous
apoptosis occurring during culture of patients’
cells, drug-induced apoptosis was calculated as the
percentage of drug specific apoptosis: (apoptosis in
treated sample - apoptosis in control) x 100 divided by
(100 - apoptosis in control). Experiments performed
on patients’ cells were analyzed for significance using
either the Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon test for paired
samples.
The combination index (CI) was determined by
the method of Chou-Talalay [26] using the Calcusyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Results were
expressed as the CI value at the effective dose inducing
50, 75 or 90% apoptosis (ED50, ED75 and ED90)
for AML cell lines. A CI less than 1 is considered as
synergistic effect, a CI equal to 1 is additive and a CI
greater than 1 is antagonist.
