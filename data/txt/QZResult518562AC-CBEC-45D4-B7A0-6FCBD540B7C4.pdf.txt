BACKGROUND: Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) have inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS) compared with patients who have aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Because PTCLs over express multidrug resistance
gene 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR-1/P-gp), we devised platinum, etoposide, gemcitabine, and methylprednisolone (PEGS) with agents that
are not substrates of the efflux pump. Gemcitabine was included because of its excellent single-agent activity in PTCL. METHODS:
Patients who had PTCL with stage II bulky disease, stage III or IV disease with extra-nodal, nodal, and transformed cutaneous presentations were eligible. Patients received intravenous cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1 through 4, etoposide 40 mg/m2 on days 1 through 4,
gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1, and methylprednisolone 250 mg on days 1 through 4 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. RESULTS: In
total, 34 patients were enrolled, 33 were eligible, and 79% were newly diagnosed. Histologic types were PTCL not otherwise specified
(n ¼ 15), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n ¼ 4), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n
¼ 6), or other T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n ¼ 8). Adverse events included 1 grade 5 infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and
9 grade 4 hematologic toxicities. The overall response rate was 39% (47% in PTCL not otherwise specified, 33% in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 25% in ALK-negative and 38% in other T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas). The PFS rate at 2 years was 12% (95%
confidence interval, 0.1%-31%), and the median PFS was 7 months. The OS rate at 2 years was 30% (95% confidence interval, 8%54%), and the median OS was 17 months. Immunohistochemical analysis of P-gp expression revealed strong positivity in a subset of
lymphoma cells (n ¼ 6) and tumor endothelium (n ¼ 25). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, PEGS was well tolerated, but OS was not considered promising given the design-specified targets. These results may serve as a benchmark for future comparisons for non-CHOP regC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Noncutaneous lymph node and extra-lymph node peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a rare heterogeneous group
of clinically aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) with a poor prognosis.1 The World Health Organization
(WHO) classification includes many subtypes,2 but understanding the pathophysiology and development of clinically
effective therapies for each entity is currently very difficult.3 Among the subtypes of PTCL, different outcomes are
observed. According to the International Prognostic Index (T-IPI), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 11% for
patients with high-risk (IPI 3-5) PTCL, not otherwise specified (NOS); 25% for patients with high-risk anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL); and 13% to 33% for patients with
high-risk ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).4 Frequently, patients with a diagnosis of PTCL receive
anthracycline-based therapy (eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP] or CHOP-like
regimens); however, their event-free survival and OS are inferior to those of patients who have aggressive B-cell NHL.5,6
Relapsed/refractory disease is common for most patients with PTCL who receive current agents7 with inadequate salvage
therapy. Autologous stem cell transplantation may be curative in a small subset of fit, chemosensitive patients.8

Original Article

The optimal therapy for PTCL is an area of controversy because of the rarity of the disease subtypes, variable
clinical course, biologic heterogeneity, and lack of clinical
trials. Studies using the Lymphoma Biology Tissue Bank
of the Southwest Oncology Group, a federally funded
cancer research cooperative group, have indicated that
patients with advanced stage PTCLs using the standard
IPI have worse survival than patients with B-cell lymphomas (P < .01), with a median progression-free survival
(PFS) of 6 months (compared with 17 months for
patients with aggressive B-cell NHL [B-NHL]) and a 2
year PFS rate of 21% (compared with 46% for patients
with B-NHL).9 The biologic explanation for this difference is unknown.
Several biomarkers of prognostic significance that
predict for a poor survival in PTCL have been identified,
including factors that drive aberrant proliferation (eg, Ki67 and p53).7 In fact, p53 is a critical prognostic factor
that correlates well with multidrug resistance gene 1/Pglycloprotein (MDR-1/P-gp) expression (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-binding cassette subfamily B1
[ABCB1]), which confers chemotherapy resistance.10,11
However, the differential expression of P-gp within the
tumor and the microenvironment has not been elucidated. Hence, we hypothesized that combination chemotherapy with agents not effluxed by MDR-1 (ABCB1)
may overwhelm P-gp and abrogate drug resistance, leading to an increased response rate that would improve PFS
and OS. Therefore, we devised a protocol based on combined cisplatin, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C),
and methylprednisolone (Solu Medrol) (ESHAP), a typical second-line chemotherapy regimen, by replacing araC with gemcitabine: ie, platinum, etoposide, gemcitabine,
and methylprednisolone (known as ‘‘PEGS’’). Gemcitabine was included in PEGS because it has potent singleagent activity in PTCL12 and is not a substrate of ABCB1.
In 44 previously treated patients with mycosis fungoides
(MF) (n ¼ 30) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTCLU) (n ¼ 14), gemcitabine administered on
days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (1200 mg/m2) produced 5 complete responses (CRs) and 26 partial
responses (PRs). The CR and PR rates were similar for
MF and PTCLU, with a median duration of CR and PR
of 15 months and 10 months, respectively.12
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

This study was conducted by Southwest Oncology Group
(S0350; National Clinical Trials [NCT] identification
number NCT00109928) with appropriate regulatory and
372

institutional review board approval for each site, and all
patients provided informed consent. Patients had to have
either newly diagnosed NHL of T-cell lineage or relapsed
or progressing disease after 1 prior treatment with a nonplatinum based chemotherapy (eg, CHOP or a CHOPlike regimen). Patients with ALK-positive ALCL were
excluded, be cause they fare better with CHOP-like therapy. All samples had central pathology review by 1 of the
authors (C.M.S.). PTCL included extra-lymph node
types (extra-lymph node natural killer [NK]/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type; enteropathy type T-cell lymphoma;
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma; and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma) and lymph node types
(peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS; ALCL, ALK-negative ALCL; and AITL). Patients who had cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma (CTCL) transformed to PTCL with systemic
involvement (not local skin transformation) also were eligible. Patients had bulky stage II, stage III, or stage IV disease according to the Ann Arbor classification.13 All
patients were required to have bidimensionally measurable disease documented within 28 days before registration. Patients with nonmeasurable disease in addition to
measurable disease were required to have the nonmeasurable disease assessed within 42 days before registration.
Patients were required to undergo a bilateral or unilateral
bone marrow aspirate and biopsy within 42 days before
registration.
Patients were aged 18 years. Women had to be of
nonchildbearing potential (postmenopausal or history of
bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy), not pregnant,
or willing to use contraception. Inclusion criteria included
a life expectancy 12 weeks; a Zubrod performance status
of 0, 1, or 2; an absolute neutrophil count 1500/mm3
and platelets 75,000/mm3; a creatinine clearance 30
mL/minute or an estimated creatinine clearance 30 mL/
minute; serum bilirubin 2 times the institutional upper
normal limit (ULN); and alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels
>2.5 the reference range ULN range or >5 times the reference range ULN with liver metastases. No prior malignancy was allowed except for adequately treated basal cell
(or squamous cell) skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or
other cancer for which the patient has been disease-free
for 5 years. Exclusion criteria included >1 prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study start; a
left ventricular ejection fraction less than the institutional
lower limit of normal; a history of ischemic heart disease
or myocardial infarction within 3 months of the study;

conditions; central nervous system involvement by lymphoma; or positive human immunodeficiency virus
status.
Study Objectives

This was a phase 2 study of patients with PTCL who
received the PEGS regimen, and the primary objective
was estimating 2 year OS. Secondary clinical objectives
were to assess toxicity, the response rate (complete unconfirmed response [CRu], CR, and PR), PFS, and P-gp
expression in patients with untreated and treated T-NHL.
Lesions were measured accurately in 2 dimensions
by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging,
medical photograph (skin or oral lesion), plain x-ray, or
other conventional technique. We recorded either the
greatest transverse tumor dimension 1 cm or palpable
lesions with 2 diameters 2 cm. Computed tomography
scans were the standard imaging modality for the evaluation of lymph node disease. Responses (CR, PR, stable
disease [SD], and progressive disease [PD]) were evaluated
according to modified Cheson criteria.14
Drug Administration

Eligible patients received intravenous cisplatin 25 mg/m2
on days 1 through 4, etoposide 40 mg/m2 on days 1
through 4, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1, and methylprednisolone 250 mg on days 1 through 4 of a 21-day
cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. Dose reductions (up to
50%) and/or delays (up to 4 weeks) were allowed. Bone
marrow colony-stimulating factors were not to be used
routinely in this protocol. However, such factors could be
used in individual patients if the presence of severe neutropenia required either delays in therapy or a dose reduction or in patients with neutropenic fever.
P-Glycoprotein Expression by
Immunohistochemistry

Thirty-three patients underwent histologic evaluation.
Two were excluded from the P-gp analysis because there
was insufficient tissue for study. All others were evaluated
for P-gp using both JSB-1 (Covance, Dedham, Mass) and
C494 (Covance, Dedham, Mass) murine monoclonal
antibodies, which target the 170-kDa, ATP-dependent,
multispecific drug transporter ABCB1.15 Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Ventana Ultra
automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson,
Ariz). Tissue sections were cut at 3 microns, and an initial
antigen retrieval process was performed on the Ultra. After antigen amplification, antibody detection was performed using the Ultra. After a hematoxylin and eosin
counterstain was performed, each slide was coverslipped
and evaluated. Evaluation included both tumor and residCancer

ual background components. If the lymphoma was composed of large cells, then determination of their P-gp
status was certain. However, when tumor cells and residual small lymphocytes were of similar size, the P-gp status
of each group was not always able to be determined with
complete certainty.
Statistical Methods

The primary objective of this study was to estimate 2 year
OS. We calculated that, if 30 patients accrued over 4 years
with an additional 2 years of follow-up, this would be sufficient to estimate 2-year survival to within 0.18.
Assuming an historic 2-year survival probability of 0.48
for patients advanced stage T-cell lymphomas, with 30
patients, this would have 81% power (1-sided 0.03 level;
1-sample exact binomial test) to detect an improvement
to a 2-year survival probability of 0.72 assuming complete
follow-up on all patients for 2 years. An estimated 2-year
survival probability of 0.67 would warrant further investigation of this regimen. Thirty patients also would be sufficient to estimate response, the probability of any
particular adverse event, and PFS to within 18%. Any
adverse event that occurs with at least 8% probability is
likely to be observed at least once (92% chance).
The following definitions applied to time-related
endpoints. OS was defined as the time between study
registration and death from any cause. PFS was defined as
the time between study registration and documented disease progression or death if no progression was observed.
The time to response (TTR) was defined as the time
between study registration and the first documentation of
a response (either first documentation of PR, or, if no documentation of PR, then first documentation of a confirmed CR or a CRu). Response duration was defined as
the time between the first documentation of response and
progression, death, or the date of last contact (if the
patient remained alive without progression). Median and
range values are provided for the TTR. Median and 2year estimates of PFS, OS, and response duration and
their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using
Kaplan-Meier to account for censoring.16
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Thirty-four patients were enrolled. One patient was ineligible because of insufficient prestudy documentation.
Among the 33 eligible patients, the T-NHL subtypes
were PTCL, NOS (n ¼ 15); AITL (n ¼ 6); ALK-negative
ALCL (n ¼ 4); nasal NK/T-NHL (n ¼ 2); and other TNHLs (n ¼ 6; including 1 subcutaneous, panniculitis-like

T-cell lymphoma; 1 enteropathy-associated T-cell
lymphoma, type II; and 4 T-cell lymphomas with likely
diagnoses of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma [n
¼ 1], AITL [n ¼ 2], and ALK-negative ALCL [n ¼ 1]).
Most diagnostic biopsies were from lymph nodes (19 of
33 biopsies; 58%), and the remaining biopsies originated
from varied sites. The median patient age was 60 years
(range, 20-92 years), and 22 patients (67%) were men.
The majority of patients enrolled on S0350 were newly
diagnosed and chemotherapy-naive (79%) (Table 1).
Patient characteristics also were analyzed between
those with newly diagnosed disease versus recurrent disease. Although these groups did not differ in the proportion of patients with PTCL, NOS, most tumors with
AITL histology were in the patients with recurrent disease
(57% vs 8%; P ¼ .003). There was also a trend toward
more newly diagnosed patients having B symptoms (58%
vs 29%); however, this trend was not statistically significant, perhaps because of lack of power. No other differences were evident.
Treatment Administration

The majority of patients (n ¼ 21; 64%) completed all 6
cycles of treatment. The remaining patients received
either 4 cycles (n ¼ 1), 3 cycles (n ¼ 3), 2 cycles (n ¼ 3),
or 1 cycle (n ¼ 5). Patients who did not complete treatment were removed because of toxicity (n ¼ 2), progression (n ¼ 6), early death before assessment for response or
progression (n ¼ 2), or other reasons (n ¼ 2).
Adverse Events

The number of patients with a given type and grade of
adverse event are reported, whereas adverse events that
were unlikely to be related or that were not related to
treatment are excluded (Table 2). One patient died from
an infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, which probably was related to treatment. The worst toxicity observed
was grade 3 adverse events in 14 patients and grade 4
adverse events in 13 patients. The most common grade 3
and 4 toxicities were hematologic (n ¼ 21), metabolic (n
¼ 8), and infection (n ¼ 7).
Tumor Response

Restaging was performed 4 to 6 weeks after receipt of the
last cycle of PEGS using modified Cheson criteria.14 The
overall response rate (ORR) was 39% (13 of 33 patients)
and included 24% confirmed and unconfirmed CRs (8 of
33 patients) and 15% PRs (5 of 33 patients). SD was
observed in 12% of patients (4 of 33 patients). Among
patients who had the different subtypes of T-NHL, the
ORR was 47% (7 of 15 patients) for those with PTCL,
NOS; 33% (2 of 6 patients) for those with AITL; 25% (1

P-Glycoprotein (MDR-1/ABCB1) Is Expressed on
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Tumor Endothelium

Both monoclonal antibodies C494 and JSB-1 were used
to detect P-gp expression. Two patients did not have sufficient tissue for further study, which left 31 patient samples
for analysis. C494 revealed reactivity in a subset of tumor
cells in 6 patients; in these patients, the tumor cells were
large cells. However, at least a subset of small lymphocytes
was positive in 20 patients. This included patients whose
tumor cells were small in size, making distinction between
tumor and residual T cells problematic. Endothelium was
focally to diffusely positive in 25 patients. Four representative samples of T-NHL that were analyzed for P-gp
expression are provided in Figure 3.
DISCUSSION
The rarity of PTCL makes it difficult to conduct biologically guided clinical trials that help clinicians determine
the best therapeutic options for each of the subtypes. To
376

our knowledge, the current study is the largest completed
US cooperative group study of PTCL to date.
Patients with PTCL have received treatment similar
to the CHOP-21 regimen (CHOP every 3 weeks)
received by patients with aggressive B-NHL; however,
anthracycline-based regimens are associated with a 5-year
OS rate of <40%.15 In the interim, investigators have
developed 3 strategies to improve outcomes—dose escalation of standard chemotherapy, new chemotherapy combinations, and novel agents.3,4,7 However, none of those
strategies have improved the OS of patients with PTCL.
The mechanistic explanation for unresponsiveness to
CHOP-like therapy is unknown, but expression of
MDR-1/P-gp (ABCB1) and other ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters may be a mechanism of chemoresistance. Hence, we devised a chemotherapy protocol incorporating agents that are known to be active in PTCL
(eg, cisplatin, gemcitabine, etoposide, and methylprednisolone)17-19 and are not effluxed by the ATP-dependent

These included 2 patients with mycosis fungoides.

P-gp efflux pump to abrogate drug resistance, with the
potential to increase the response rate with an associated
improvement in PFS and OS. The chemotherapy regimen
PEGS was based on a regimen of combined cisplatin, etoposide, ara-C, and methylprednisolone (ESHAP)20 in
which ara-C was replaced with gemcitabine. ESHAP has
not been evaluated in patients with PTCL except as part
of intensive chemotherapy (high-dose CHOP/ESHAP)
followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in previously untreated patients with PTCL who achieved a combined CR and PR rate of 48%.21 However, ESHAP
treatment for relapsed and refractory B-NHL achieved a
combined CR and PR rate of 64%. The median CR duration was 20 months, and 28% of remitters were still in
CR at 3 years. The median OS duration was 14 months,
and the survival rate at 3 years was 31%. ESHAP was
identified as an active, tolerable chemotherapy regimen
for patients with relapsing and refractory lymphoma.20
Overall, PEGS was well tolerated, and 21 of 33
patients completed 6 cycles of therapy. The major grade

3/4 adverse event was myelosuppression, and the only
grade 5 adverse event was systemic infection (Table 2).
The observed outcomes, however, have been disappointing—24% of patients achieved a CR/CRu, 15% achieved
a PR, and 12% had SD with a median PFS of 9 months, a
median OS of 17 months, a 2-year PFS rate of 12% (95%
CI, 0.1%-31%), and a 2-year OS rate of 31% (95% CI,
8%-54%). The results did not reach the design target of a
2-year OS rate of 67%. The ORR did not differ between
histologic subgroups; however, power to assess differences
between subgroups was limited by the small sample size.
Results for PFS, OS, and response were similar when the
analysis was restricted to 26 previously untreated patients
and were worse than those reported for typical CHOPbased regimens (Table 3).17,22-26
Possible reasons for these disappointing results
include a relatively unfavorable patient mix, with older
patients (median age, 60 years), unfavorable PTCL histologies (no ALK-positive ALCL), and extensive disease
(58% of patients had stage IV disease, and 67% had

elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels) (Table 1). Because
of the expected older cohort and the multicenter setting,
the cisplatin dose was fractionated at 25 mg/m2 daily on
days 1 thorough 4, and methylprednisolone doses were
reduced to 250 mg on days 1 through 4, which also may
have contributed to decreased efficacy. Similarly, if the Pgp hypothesis was not correct, then the omission of cytarabine may have contributed to decreased regimen efficacy.
Conversely, the cooperative group trial setting, which represents both academic and community-based centers, may
have mitigated selection bias and may have produced a
more realistic reflection of the chemotherapy outcomes in
the general population of patients with PTCL.
However, the response duration of PEGS in previously treated patients was relatively favorable compared
with the duration achieved by other second-line regimens
(Table 4),27-32 although the number of patients treated in
first relapse was too small to draw strong conclusions.
This is not surprising, because PEGS is based on a secondline regimen, ESHAP, and this raises the possibility that
PEGS may be a viable option for second-line treatment.
Previous investigators demonstrated that P-gp is
expressed variously in normal peripheral blood T-cells,
which, in general, over express P-gp relative to B cells.33
In fact, some subsets of T cells (CD8 and CD4 cells) and
NK cells express as much as 40-fold the amount of P-gp as
circulating B cells.33 The level of detection of P-gp is several-fold greater than the level at which drug resistance is
observed, and its expression is increased further in patients
who have relapsed/refractory T-NHL and B-NHL. In the
S0350 study, the analysis of P-gp expression was conducted on diagnostic (pretreatment) biopsies, and posttreatment biopsies were not available. P-gp expression was
positive on small T cells (n ¼ 20) and in a subset of large
T cells (n ¼ 6) within the tumor. The pattern of P-gp
expression varied among the lymphoma subtypes (PTCL,
NOS; ALK-negative ALCL, AITL, and panniculitis-like
T-NHL) (Fig. 3).
Twenty-five patients had P-gp expression identified
on the tumor vascular endothelium (Fig. 3). It is known
that ABC transporters decorate the luminal plasma membrane of the brain capillary endothelium facing the vascular space, and they protect the central nervous system
from entry of neurotoxins.34,35 Our data suggest that the
tumor microenvironment of small T-lymphocytes and
blood vessels that over express P-gp effectively efflux the
administered chemotherapy and allow tumor growth in
the presence of chemotherapy. This may explain the ineffectiveness of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in
patients with PTCL. Furthermore, it is known that doxor378

ubicin enhances constitutive P-gp expression, resulting in
the exclusion of doxorubicin from tumor cells and endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature.35 Because vascularization and P-gp expression are prerequisites for tumor
growth in a hypoxic environment,36 the inhibition of
P-gp in tumor endothelial cells may be a clinical approach
to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy. It is noteworthy that, of 9 patients with PTCL who had B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression evaluated, 8
demonstrated Bcl2 expression within tumor cells. This
finding, coupled with an environment in which drug levels are subtherapeutic because of P-gp expression, may
explain the poor relapse-free survival and outcome in the
majority of our patients.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, S0350 is the largest completed US cooperative group study of PTCL to
date to test a novel chemotherapy regimen (PEGS). Further work on P-gp should focus not only on tumor cells
but also on the tumor microenvironment, including
blood vessels. PEGS may be considered a benchmark for
future comparisons with non-CHOP regimens in PTCL
and for the design of rational combinations with targeted
agents.
