Granule exocytosis mediates immune surveillance of senescent
cells

Senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest program that contributes to tumor suppression, organismal aging and certain wound healing
responses. During liver ﬁbrosis, for example, hepatic stellate cells initially proliferate and secrete extracellular matrix components
that produce ﬁbrosis; however, these cells eventually senesce and are cleared by immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells.
Here, we examine how NK cells target senescent cells and assess the impact of this process on liver ﬁbrosis. We show that granule
exocytosis, but not death-receptor-mediated apoptosis, is required for NK-cell-mediated killing of senescent cells. This pathway bias
is due to upregulation of the decoy death receptor, Dcr2, an established senescence marker that attenuates NK-mediated cell
death. Accordingly, mice with defects in granule exocytosis accumulate senescent stellate cells and display more liver ﬁbrosis in
response to a ﬁbrogenic agent. Our results thus provide new insights into the immune surveillance of senescent cells and reveal
how granule exocytosis has a protective role against liver ﬁbrosis.

INTRODUCTION
Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest that limits
tumor development in response to oncogenic mutations and
certain chemotherapies.1–3 Recent studies suggest that
senescence can also act to limit wound healing responses and
may participate in organismal aging. For instance, in liver ﬁbrosis,
the senescence of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main
ﬁbrogenic cell type in the liver, limits tissue damage and
accelerates repair,4 and similar mechanisms regulate tissue
damage during wound healing in the skin and oral submucous
ﬁbrosis.5,6 Moreover, mice engineered to eliminate senescent cells
from tissues show improved ﬁtness during longevity,7 and
clearance of pre-cancerous senescent hepatocytes is crucial for
liver cancer suppression.8 Hence, factors that control senescent
cell numbers in vivo may broadly impact cancer progression,
tissue damage and functional decline.
Senescence is accompanied by phenotypic and transcriptional
changes that identify senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. For
example, senescent cells display a large and ﬂat morphology
in vitro and upregulate a senescence-associated b-galactosidase
(SA-b-gal).9 Senescent cells often display global changes in
chromatin structure10 that are associated with downregulation
of cell cycle genes and components of the extracellular matrix and
upregulation of immune modulators and matrix degrading
enzymes.4 Comparative analyses of gene expression data have
produced some markers that appear speciﬁc for senescence,11
including the p15ink4b cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and the
decoy receptor 2 (Dcr2, formally TNFRSF10D). Although p15ink4b
likely contributes to the senescence-associated cell cycle arrest,12
whether decoy receptors or some other senescence markers
actively participate in the program remains unknown.

Senescence acts through a coordinated program involving cell
autonomous and cell nonautonomous components.13 In a cell
autonomous manner, the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways
act to produce the stable cell cycle arrest that is the hallmark of
senescence.1 These proteins are activated by, or activate, cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, such as p15ink4b, p16ink4a and p21,
which lead to stable suppression of E2F target genes.10,14
Secreted proteins, regulated at least partially by NF-kB, enhance
cell cycle arrest and are largely responsible for mediating the
impact of senescent cells on tissue biology.15–17 These factors
can attract immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells,
triggering the recognition and ultimate clearance of the
senescent cells from tumors or tissue.4,18 Such mechanisms may
be necessary to prevent the long-term damage that might be
produced by senescent cells, and to facilitate tissue repair and
homeostasis.
The mechanisms whereby NK cells eliminate senescent cells
from tissues are not known. NK cells rely on two independent
mechanisms to eliminate a variety of external and internal threats,
including tumor cells.19,20 The ligands on the surface of NK cells,
TRAIL and FAS ligand (FasL) bind corresponding receptors on
target cells leading to caspase activation and cell death—a
process that can be exquisitely controlled though the expression
of various positive and negative regulators.21,22 NK cells can also
eliminate target cells through granule exocytosis, a process
involving the production of perforin and granzyme (A, B)
containing granules, which are secreted from the NK cell upon
interaction with the target cell.21,23 Perforin is responsible for
perforating the cell membrane and thus enabling granzyme
release into the target cells where it can induce cell death by both
caspase-dependent and independent pathways.24 Both pathways

are necessary for efﬁcient NK-mediated defense of the liver from
carcinogenesis and metastasis.25,26
Here, we set out to understand how NK cells eliminate
senescent cells from tissues and the implications of such
mechanisms on liver ﬁbrosis. Our results indicate that the granule
exocytosis, and not death-receptor-mediated apoptosis, is essential for the NK-mediated surveillance of the senescent cells and
that disruption of this pathway leads to the accumulation of
senescent cells in damaged livers and increased ﬁbrosis. Our study
thus provides the key biological and mechanistic insights into the
immune surveillance of senescent cells.

RESULTS
Efﬁcient killing of senescent cells by NK cells
In order to understand how NK cells target senescent cells, we
employed an in vitro cytotoxicity assay whereby normal and
senescent cells are co-cultured with the NK cells.4 We incorporated
as one model the human NK cell line, YT. The cells express
components of both the death receptor and granule exocytosis
pathways and can engage both mechanisms to eliminate target
cells.27,28 To determine whether cytotoxicity could be assessed
over a wide dynamic range, we assessed viability using different
ratios of target cells to NK cells. IMR-90 human diploid ﬁbroblasts,
which have been widely used to study senescence,10 were
triggered to senescence by treatment with the DNA damage
agent, Etoposide. Within days, these cells displayed senescence
features including a stable cell cycle arrest and upregulation of the
NK cell receptor ligands and adhesion molecules that could
mediate their interaction with the NK cells.4
Senescent and growing (control) IMR-90 cells were co-cultured
with YT cells for 12 h at 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 target cell to NK-cell
ratios. Of note, we were unable to measure NK-mediated
cytotoxicity using traditional assays that rely on the loading of
the target cells with 51Cr, because efﬁcient loading requires a
threshold level of cell proliferation29 that cannot be achieved in
senescent cells. As an alternative, we measured cell death
indirectly by assessing cell viability using crystal violet staining
to quantify the remaining viable cells at the end of the coincubation period (Figure 1) and corroborated our results using
propidium iodide-based viability assays and time lapse video
microscopy.4 Combined, these studies conﬁrmed that reductions
in viable cells assessed by crystal violet staining were associated
with cell death. As expected, NK cells eliminated senescent cells at
least twice as efﬁciently as growing cells throughout the range of
target to effector cell ratios tested (Po0.005). Such enhanced

range of target:effector cell ratios. Senescent or growing IMR-90

ratios and cytotoxicity was determined. The graphs represent the
average and the s.e. of triplicate measurements from at least three

sensitivity was also observed with a second NK cell line, NK-92,
and primary human NK cells (see Supplementary Figures S1 and
3C). Hence, this system provides a robust assay to study NKmediated killing of senescent cells.
Death receptor signaling is dispensable for NK-mediated targeting
of senescent cells
To determine whether the increased sensitivity of senescent cells
to NK cell killing might involve death receptor signaling, we ﬁrst
asked whether senescent cells were more sensitive to the death
receptor ligand, FasL. At a concentration of 2 ng/ml, FasL induced
threefold more killing in growing cells than in senescent IMR-90
cells (Po0.001, Figure 2a), though at higher concentrations this
difference was not signiﬁcant. Similarly, TRAIL induced even more
efﬁcient killing of senescent cells at the concentrations of 10 and
100 ng/ml (Po0.001 and Po0.0001, respectively, Supplementary
Figure S2)
We also examined whether blocking the death-receptormediated apoptosis using either the caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IEDTFMK or the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK would attenuate NKmediated cell death. As expected, both compounds signiﬁcantly
inhibited FasL-induced cytotoxicity in both growing (Po0.05 and
Po0.001, for Z-IEDT and Z-VAD, respectively) and senescent
(Po0.001 and Po0.0001 for Z-IEDT and Z-VAD, respectively) cells
(Figure 2a). Thus, as anticipated from other systems, the caspase
inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK and Z-IEDT-FMK, efﬁciently inhibit cell
death induced by a death receptor ligand in senescent cells.
We next evaluated whether the death receptor pathway
contributes to NK-mediated elimination of senescent cells.
We co-incubated NK (YT) cells with growing or senescent IMR-90
cells in the presence or absence of either the caspase inhibitor

senescent cells. Senescent or growing IMR-90 fibroblasts were
incubated for 12 h with either 2 or 10 nM FasL (a). Caspase inhibitors
Z-VAD-FMK or Z-IEDT-FMK were added at the concentration of 10 mM
as indicated. Cytotoxicity was determined at the end of the coincubation period. Senescent or growing IMR-90 fibroblasts were coincubated with YT cells for 12 h in the presence of 10 mM of caspase
inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK or Z-IEDT-FMK and then the cytotoxicity was
determined (b). The graphs represent the average and the s.e. of
triplicate measurements from at least three independent experiments. *Po0.05, ***Po0.001.

Z-VAD-FMK or Z-IEDT-FMK. Neither inhibitor suppressed NK-cellmediated cytotoxicity towards senescent cells (Figure 2b). In fact,
the viability of the NK cells themselves was slightly increased in
the presence of the inhibitors, perhaps suggesting that these
effector cells target each other through death-receptor-mediated
mechanisms. Therefore, the death receptor pathway is dispensable for NK cell targeting of senescent IMR-90 cells.

Granule exocytosis mediates the targeting of senescent cells by
NK cells
We next took a pharmacological approach to explore the role of
granule exocytosis in NK cell targeting of senescent cells. When
the NK-cell-mediated killing assay was performed in the presence
of the granule exocytosis inhibitor Concanamycin A (CMA), the
speciﬁc killing of the senescent cells was almost completely
eliminated at all target to effector cell ratios tested
(Supplementary Figure S3). For example, at a target to effector
cell ratio of 1:10, the average killing of senescent cells was reduced
fourfold in the presence of the CMA (Po0.001; Figure 3a).
Similarly, pre-treatment of NK (YT) cells with the granzyme B
inhibitor 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (3,4-DCI), dramatically reduced
the cytotoxicity when cultured with senescent cell targets (12 h)
compared with the effector cells incubated in the presence of a
vehicle control (Figure 3a). Similar results were obtained using a
different NK cell line (NK-92, Supplementary Figure S1). Together
these data indicate that the granule exocytosis cell death
pathway, rather than the death receptor pathway, mediates NKcell-facilitated elimination of senescent cells.
To extend our studies to the use of primary cells, we cocultured growing and senescent IMR-90 cells with primary
human NK cells derived from whole blood and expanded
in vitro as previously described.30 As primary NK cells are more
potent than the YT NK cell line, the time of co-incubation was
reduced to 2 h, where substantial levels of cytotoxicity were
achieved (Figure 3). Despite this increased potency, treatment
with either CMA or 3,4-DCI dramatically reduced NK-cellmediated death of senescent IMR-90 cells (Figure 3c, Po0.001
for both treatments). The concordance between results from
primary NK cells and two NK cell lines further underscores the
importance of our models and the value of YT cells for studying
NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
A physiological setting in which clearance of senescent cells
by NK cells has an important role is in liver ﬁbrosis, where the
NK-cells-mediated elimination of senescent activated HSCs limits
the extent of ﬁbrosis and facilitates repair.4 As occurs in senescent
ﬁbroblasts, both CMA and 3,4-DCI attenuated YT-mediated killing
of senescent HSCs in 12 h cytotoxicity assays (Figure 3b, Po0.001
for both agents), suggesting a general role for this program in the
immune surveillance of senescent cells.

Dcr2 attenuates NK-cell-mediated targeting of senescent cells
The fact that senescent cells are preferentially killed by granule
exocytosis and are resistant to death receptor killing is intriguing
in light of the senescence-speciﬁc upregulation of Dcr2—a decoy
receptor that acts as a competitive inhibitor of death receptor
signaling by death ligands, such as Fas or TRAIL.11,31 Indeed,
studies have identiﬁed and used high Dcr2 as a robust marker of
senescence in tissues (for example, Collado et al. and Xue
et al.11,18) although its physiological contribution to the program
is unknown. As expected, Dcr2 expression mRNA and protein was
signiﬁcantly increased in senescent IMR-90 cells and HSCs
(Po0.0001 and Po0.05 for mRNA, respectively, Figures 4a-d,
Supplementary Figure S4A). In principle, the observed increase in
an inhibitor of death receptor signaling might explain the
pathway bias towards granule exocytosis observed for NKmediated killing of senescent cells.
To test this hypothesis directly, we examined the requirement
for Dcr2 in TRAIL-mediated cell death using small-interfering RNAs
capable of potently suppressing Dcr2 protein in senescent IMR-90
cells (Figure 4f, Supplementary Figures S4B and C). Consistent with
the ability of Dcr2 to modulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis, TRAIL
induced twofold more killing in senescent IMR-90 cells transfected
with siDcr2 comparing with siControl (Figure 4e, Po0.001,
Po0.0001 for 10 and 100 ng/ml TRAIL, respectively). Moreover,
senescent IMR-90 cells depleted of Dcr2 using either Dcr2
targeting small-interfering RNAs or a potent short hairpin RNA
(Figure 4h) were more susceptible to killing by YT NK cells
compared with cells transduced with control RNAi (Figure 4g,
Po0.05, Figure 4i, Po0.05). Thus, NK cell cytotoxicity towards
senescent cells is normally attenuated by the upregulation
of Dcr2.
Granule exocytosis modulates liver ﬁbrosis
If granule exocytosis is crucial for the immune surveillance of
senescent cells in vivo, disruption of this program should alter the
progression of liver ﬁbrosis—a pathology where NK cell accumulation and senescent cell clearance has been shown to have a
role.4 To examine this possibility, we induced ﬁbrosis in wild-type
(wt) and perforin knockout (Prf  /  ) C57BL/6 mice by 12
consecutive bi-weekly injections of CCl4. To assess ﬁbrosis
progression, liver sections from treated and untreated mice
were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and the
collagen-speciﬁc dye, Sirius red (Figure 5a). Fibrosis was not
detected in untreated mice, nor were there any detectable
differences in liver architecture between wt and Prf  /  mice.
As expected, livers from CCl4-treated mice of both genotypes
displayed a characteristic ﬁbrotic histology.
The extracellular matrix is deposited by the activated HSCs and
their expansion is directly linked to the progression of ﬁbrosis.32,33

senescent IMR-90 cells were incubated with either 10 or 100 ng/ml TRAIL and cytotoxicity was determined (e), and Dcr2 knockdown
confirmed (f ). Senescent IMR-90 cells with siDcr2 or siControl were incubated with YT cells for 12 h and cytotoxicity was determined (g). In the
parallel approach IMR-90 cells were infected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Dcr2 (shDcr2) or control shRNA targeting luciferase
(shLuci) and induced to senescence by etoposide treatment. Dcr2 protein level was assessed by immunoblot (h). The cells were co-incubated
for 12 h with YT cells and cytotoxicity was determined (i). The graphs represent the average and the s.e. of triplicate measurements from at
least four independent experiments *Po0.05, **Po0.001, ***Po0.0001.

Deposits of extracellular matrix in ﬁbrotic scars of these livers were
identiﬁed by Sirius Red staining and quantiﬁed using
morphometric analysis of whole-liver sections,4 and the relative
abundance of activated HSCs was assessed by analyzing
expression of the HSC markers aSMA (alpha smooth muscle
actin) and Collagen1a in whole-liver lysates. Even in our short
12-week protocol, scarring was increased by 60% in Prf  /  mice
comparing with wt (Po0.0001) (Figure 5a,b). Furthermore,
immunoblotting showed an increased presence of both aSMA
and Collagen1a in CCl4-treated Prf  /  livers compared with wt
controls, indicating that the increase in ﬁbrosis was also
accompanied by enhanced expansion of the activated HSC
compartment (Figure 5c). Therefore, perforin—and thus an intact
granule exocytosis pathway—limits ﬁbrosis progression.
To determine whether the granule exocytosis pathway inﬂuences the abundance of senescent cells, we examined wt and
Prf  /  ﬁbrotic livers for the senescent markers SA-b-gal, p15ink4b
and Dcr2 following CCl4 treatment. As an additional control, we
also examined these markers in mice deﬁcient for senescent cells
owing to deletion of p53 and Ink4a/Arf, a setting where enhanced
ﬁbrosis arises owing to defects in senescence induction.4
Consistent with our previous report, SA-b-gal-positive cells were
found predominantly in the livers of CCl4-treated mice and in
areas adjacent or within the ﬁbrotic scars4 (Figure 5d). Using an
imaging approach to quantify the tissue area occupied by SA-bgal-positive cells (see Materials and methods), we noted a
signiﬁcant increase in senescent cells retained in Prf  /  livers
compared with controls (Figure 5e, Po0.001). Similarly, Prf  / 
livers from CCl4-treated mice showed enhanced expression of
p15Ink4a and Dcr2 relative to treated livers from wt controls
Oncogene (2013) 1971 – 1977

(Figure 5c, Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). By contrast, few
SA-b-gal-positive cells and low p15Ink4b levels were observed in
livers from CCl4-treated p53  /  ;Ink4a/Arf  /  mice (Figure 5c,
Supplementary Figure S5), even though these livers also showed
more activated HSCs and ﬁbrosis (Supplementary Figure S4).4
Together these data indicate that excessive liver ﬁbrosis can arise
from defects in the senescence of activated stellate cells or, as
shown here, from the failure to eliminate these cells once they
become senescent.
DISCUSSION
NK-cell-mediated clearance of senescent cells is one component
of the coordinated process whereby cellular senescence limits the
extent of liver ﬁbrosis and facilitates wound repair.4,18 Recent
studies also suggest that senescent cell clearance by immune cells
promotes tumor regression in established tumors.18 Our results
demonstrate that the granule exocytosis pathway, but not the
death receptor pathway, is necessary for the speciﬁc killing of
senescent ﬁbroblasts and stellate cells by NK cells and participates
in the clearance of senescent activated HSCs to limit liver ﬁbrosis.
Therefore, NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity through granule
exocytosis contributes to immune surveillance of senescent cells
in vitro and in vivo.
Several types of cytotoxic lymphocytes can use granule
exocytosis pathway to eliminate their target cells.21 For example,
invariant NK T cells, which are abundant in the liver, limit the initial
stages of liver ﬁbrosis, presumably through targeting activated
stellate cells.34 However, the functional contribution of invariant
NK T cells for the clearance of senescent cells has not been

examined. CD8 þ cytotoxic T lymphocytes also rely on granule
exocytosis for cell-mediated cytotoxicity23 and defects in their
action could contribute to the enhanced phenotypes we observe
in Prf  /  mice. Still, NK cells, which accumulate in the liver during
ﬁbrosis, are sufﬁcient to eliminate senescent cells in vitro, and the
primary NK cell populations used in these studies were 99% of
CD56 þ cells and devoid of T cells.30 However, we do not exclude
the possibility that other immune cells contribute to the
surveillance of senescent cells in tissues and, indeed, a recent
report suggests that clearance of premalignant senescent
hepatocytes is mediated by CD4 T cells and macrophages.8
In addition to the granule exocytosis pathway, most cytotoxic
lymphocytes engage the death receptor pathway to eliminate
target cells. This pathway is widely used by NK cells in the liver.21
NK cell express high levels of the death receptor ligand TRAIL
upon activation with IL-2,26 are suggested to participate in the
surveillance of the HSCs,35 and protect against tumor
development following chemical carcinogenesis.36 Given this, we
were surprised that death-receptor-mediated cytotoxicity was
dispensable for the immune surveillance of senescent cells.
Consistent with these ﬁndings, an anti-TRAIL antibody failed to
inhibit immune system-mediated tumor clearance following p53
restoration in a liver carcinoma model18 (W Xue and SWL,
unpublished data). Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility
that death receptor pathways contribute to senescent cell
clearance in other settings.
Why does granule exocytosis, and not the death-receptor
signaling, mediate NK-cell surveillance of senescent cells?
Mechanistically, this appears partly because of the accumulation
of Dcr2 during senescence, which occurs in ﬁbroblasts, certain
epithelial cells11,18 and, as shown here, also senescent activated
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

HSCs. Dcr2 can bind death-receptor ligands, with higher afﬁnity to
TRAIL, but as it lacks the activation domain it prevents
downstream signaling through the death receptor pathway31,37
and, therefore, can protect senescent cells from death-receptorligand-mediated killing. Another decoy receptor, Dcr3, has higher
afﬁnity to FASL.38 However, in contrast to Dcr2, Dcr3 is a secreted
receptor and is much less likely to have a role in direct interaction
between senescent and NK cells. Although previously considered
merely a senescence marker, our results establish a functional role
for Dcr2 in protecting senescent cells from cytotoxicity through
the death receptor pathway induced by NK cells and possibly
other cells as well. The biological rationale for this regulation
remains unclear, but may serve to prevent autoimmunity
following short-term tissue damage.
In addition to blocking the death receptor pathway, senescent
cells may also stimulate NK cells to induce the perforin-mediated
killing. Senescent cells upregulate expression of several ligands of
NK-cell receptor NKG2D4,39 and ICAM-1, the ligand of NK-cell
receptor LFA-1.40 Studies suggest that activation of the NKG2D
receptor induces granule exocytosis to eliminate cancer cells, a
process that might be reinforced by signaling from LFA-1.41 In this
manner, ligands upregulated in senescent cells might activate
multiple NK-cell receptors to trigger granule exocytosis.
The role of granule exocytosis in the surveillance of senescent cells
has important ramiﬁcations for understanding and treating wound
healing and cancer. Indeed, we show that the immune clearance of
senescent activated HSCs has a signiﬁcant impact on the pathophysiology of liver ﬁbrosis in which the granule exocytosis pathway has
been previously implicated.42,43 Beyond the liver, immune
surveillance of senescent cells might have a signiﬁcant role in other
ﬁbrosis-related pathological conditions such as lung ﬁbrosis, atopic

dermatitis and atherosclerosis, where granule exocytosis has also
been implicated in disease pathology.44–46
Still, the most prevalent conditions where senescence has been
studied to date involve cancer and aging.3,9 Senescent cells
accumulate with age and contribute to functional decline of
multiple tissues7,9 while perforin-mediated granule exocytosis
diminishes at that time.47,48 Separate studies suggest that the
integrity of the granule exocytosis pathway can modulate a variety
of cancer phenotypes.49,50 Though deﬁnitive proof will require
further testing, we speculate that the granule exocytosis pathway
contributes to immune surveillance of senescent cells in each of
these conditions. In principle, pharmacological modulation of this
pathway, as has been recently described using IL21,51 might
increase the clearance of senescent cells from premalignant,
damaged or aged tissues to limit carcinogenesis and the decline in
tissue function accompanying the accumulation of senescent cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture and cytotoxicity assays
Human diploid ﬁbroblasts IMR-90 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and primary
human hepatic myoﬁbroblasts (activated HSCs) (Dominion Pharmakine,
Derio – Bizkaia, Spain) were grown in standard conditions. Senescence was
induced by etoposide (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) treatment as described
previously.4 In vitro cytotoxicity assays using the NK cell line, YT, were
performed for 12 h as described previously.4 The long incubation period
enables efﬁcient execution of both granule exocytosis and death-receptormediated cytotoxicity.
For the cytotoxicity assays performed with primary human NK cells,
target cells were plated in 12-well plates at 4  104 cells per well; 1  105
NK cells (more than 99% of CD56 þ ; CD3  (Hanna et al.30) (gift from O
Mandelboim, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem,
Israel.) were subsequently added to each well. Following 2 h of coincubation, primary NK cells were washed gently and the cytotoxicity was
determined based on quantiﬁcation of remaining adherent cells.
To inhibit the granule exocytosis or granzyme B the cytotoxicity assays
were performed in the presence of 100 nM CMA or the effector cells were
pre-incubated with 25 mM of 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (3,4-DCI), respectively,
(both Sigma). The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and Z-IEDT-FMK (MBL,
Woburn, MA, USA) were used at separate assays at a concentration of 10 mM.
In effector cell independent experiments, the target cells were incubated
for 12 h with 2 or 10 ng/ml FasL in the presence of 10 mg/ml of a crosslinking antibody or for 24 h with 10 or 100 ng/ml TRAIL (both R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). The cytotoxicity was determined using staining of
the remaining adherent cells.

Mice
The Prf  /  mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME, USA) and C57Bl6 mice served as wt controls. For ﬁbrosis induction, the
mice were treated twice a week, with i.p. injection of 1 ml/kg CCl4, for 6
weeks as described.4
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue was sectioned and stained
either with hematoxylin–eosin for routine examination, or with Sirius red
for visualization of ﬁbrotic deposition. The relative ﬁbrotic area was
calculated based on Sirius red staining as previously described.4
Detection of SA-b-gal activity was performed as described previously.4
For quantiﬁcation of the staining in the mouse tissue, images of whole-liver
sections were taken from multiple slides (derived from at least 6 mice of
each genotype) using 3D Histech Digital Microscopy scanner (3DHISTECH
Kft., Budapest, Hungary). The images were quantiﬁed using Image-Pro
software package (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Detection and modiﬁcation of gene expression
Detection of protein expression by immunoblotting was performed using antiaSMA (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-p15 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-Collagen1a (Rockland, PA, USA), anti-b Actin
(AC-15, Sigma), anti-DCR2 (Assay designs, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
For quantitative RT–PCR total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin kit
(Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) and 1 mg was reverse transcribed using
the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Glen
Burnie, MD, USA). The cDNA samples were ampliﬁed using Fast SYBR Green
Oncogene (2013) 1971 – 1977

Master Mix in StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (both Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The relative expression of Dcr2 was
normalized using the expression levels of either b-Actin or GAPDH. Primer
sequences are available upon request.
ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool small-interfering RNA targeting Dcr2 and
the nontargeting (control) pool were transfected into senescent IMR-90
cells with Dharmafect 1 reagent (all from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA).
The experiments using retroviral vectors (pMLP (targeting human Dcr2)
and pMLP (targeting Luciferase)) were performed as described.14
