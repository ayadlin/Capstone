ABSTRACT
Cytotoxic radiotherapy unfavorably induces tumor cells to generate various
proangiogenic substances, promoting post-irradiation angiogenesis (PIA), which
is one of major causes of radiotherapy failure. Though several studies have
reported some mechanisms behind PIA, they have not yet described the beginning
proangiogenic motivator buried in the irradiated microenvironment. In this work, we
revealed that dying tumor cells induced by irradiation prompted PIA via a caspase 3
dependent mechanism. Proteolytic inactivation of caspase 3 in dying tumor cells by
transducing a dominant-negative version weakened proangiogenic effects in vitro and
in vivo. In addition, inhibition of caspase 3 activity suppressed tumor angiogenesis
and tumorigenesis in xenograft mouse model. Importantly, we identified vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A as a downstream proangiogenic factor regulated
by caspase 3 possibly through Akt signaling. Collectively, these findings indicated
that besides acting as a key executioner in apoptosis, caspase 3 in dying tumor cells
may play a central role in driving proangiogenic response after irradiation. Thus,
radiotherapy in combination with caspase 3 inhibitors may be a novel promising
therapeutic strategy to reduce tumor recurrence due to restrained PIA.

INTRODUCTION

reported that IR would undesirably stimulate tumor
cells to up-regulate proangiogenic molecules, such as
VEGF [7-10], basic fibroblast growth factor [11], matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 [12, 13], MMP-9 [10, 12],
urinary plasminogen activator [10], ephrin-A1 [14],
prostaglandin E2 [15] and a profile of cytokines [16],
which may contribute to tumor radioresistance [7, 8, 14]
or tumor repopulation [15, 17].
Additionally, evidence coming from both mouse
model [18] and patient specimens [19] has suggested
that neovascularization after irradiation mediates tumor
recurrence and leads to treatment failure [20]. Therefore,
it is of great significance to uncover the mechanisms
responsible for PIA. For instance, one group reported

Radiotherapy is one of the most important strategies
for cancer treatment, especially for advanced cancer.
Cytotoxic ionizing radiation (IR) induces tumor cell death
through various mechanisms [1]. It has already been
indicated that besides tumor cell phenotype, endothelial
radiosensitivity pivotally modulates tumor response to
radiotherapy [2]. Unsurprisingly, IR exerts cytotoxic
effects on endothelial cells both in vitro [3, 4] and in vivo
[5, 6]. To some extent, curative effects of radiotherapy
are acquired due to vasculature damage and subsequent
blockade of blood and nutrient supply. However, contrary
to its anti-angiogenic effects, numerous studies have

that enhanced invasive ability of human microvascular
endothelial cells induced by conditioned medium (CM)
from irradiated B16 cells was attributable to MMP2 [13]. Another study discovered that MMP-9 played
an important role in PIA, by impelling shedding of
Syndecan-1 from cell surface [21]. Furthermore, it was
recently reported that depletion of DNA-dependent protein
kinase catalytic subunit in glioblastoma cells inhibited IRinduced proangiogenic effects, with decreased secretion
of VEGF [22].
Although these studies recognized important
mechanisms by which irradiated tumor cells induce
and facilitate angiogenesis, they failed to unveil the
initial proangiogenic force hidden in the irradiated
microenvironment. Since there is a great deal of tumor
cell death after radiotherapy, we proposed the hypothesis
that irradiation-induced dying tumor cells may serve as
a provider, exerting a potent proangiogenic impact on
the irradiated milieu. Our data established crucial role
of dying tumor cells in promoting PIA. As a deeper step,
we unexpectedly found that caspase 3, a well-recognized
cysteine protease mediating apoptosis execution, critically
modulates proangiogenic effects inflicted by dying tumor
cells. We believe that this novel caspase 3-mediated
proangiogenic mechanism may provide new therapeutic
strategies for cancer treatment or certain irradiationinduced vascular proliferative disorders [23-25].

compared with controls (sham-irradiated feeders and no
feeder) (Figure 1B). Notably, the bioluminescence signals
of HUVEC-Fluc cocultured with 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29
cells were over 25-fold and 16-fold higher than signals
of HUVEC-Fluc cocultured with sham-irradiated HT-29
cells and no feeder, respectively. As a further step, since
HUVEC-Fluc were also labeled with GFP in tandem with
luciferase, we confirmed the proliferation-stimulating
effect of irradiated HT-29 cells on HUVEC-Fluc using
confocal microscopy detecting GFP and representative
photographs were shown (Figure 1B). Furthermore, our
results exhibited that 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 cells also
exerted potent proliferation-stimulating effect on HUVECFluc when HUVEC-Fluc were seeded onto hanging cell
culture inserts, hence strongly indicating that soluble
transmissible factors secreted from irradiated tumor cells
participated in this process (Figure 1C). Apart from great
capacity of irradiated tumor cells to promote HUVEC
proliferation, we also studied whether irradiated tumor
cells could enhance HUVEC migration. CM collected
from HT-29 cells exposed to 10 Gy irradiation displayed
highly stronger property to promote HUVEC migration,
compared with CM from sham-irradiated HT-29 (Figure
1D). Thereby, these results indicate that irradiated tumor
cells in vitro potently stimulate HUVEC proliferation
and migration, in which soluble factors released from
irradiated tumor cells may be involved.

vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and

Continuing our study, we then investigated whether
irradiated tumor cells could establish a proangiogenic
microenvironment in vivo. We injected a small number
(1 × 105) of HUVEC-Fluc mixed with a large number
(1 × 106) 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 cells subcutaneously
into right hind legs of nude mice. An equal number of
HUVEC-Fluc were injected subcutaneously into left
hind legs of nude mice as control. Subsequently, we
monitored the survival or growth of HUVEC-Fluc in
vivo noninvasively via bioluminescence imaging. Results
showed that bioluminescence signals of left hind legs of
nude mice decreased significantly 4 days after injection,
indicating that HUVEC-Fluc alone failed to survive in
vivo (Figure 1E). However, bioluminescence signals of
co-injection side were maintained and gradually increased
after injection despite a slight decline on day 4, suggesting
that irradiated HT-29 cells engendered a proangiogenic
microenvironment in which HUVEC-Fluc survived
(Figure 1E). Moreover, in order to confirm that HUVECFluc did survive in vivo, immunofluorescence staining for
GFP and CD31 was carried out to analyze tumor sections
from co-injection side. As shown in Figure 1F, not only
did GFP and CD31 co-expression exist, but also HUVECFluc formed vessel-like structure, indicating that HUVEC-

To determine the proangiogenic ability of
irradiated tumor cells, we first investigated the influence
of irradiated tumor cells on HUVEC proliferation and
migration, two initial events required for angiogenesis. To
examine whether irradiated tumor cells could stimulate
surrounding endothelial cell proliferation, we established
the following in vitro model. A small number (100-500)
of firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP)
labeled HUVECs, designated as HUVEC-Fluc, were
seeded onto a large number (2-2.5 × 105) of HT-29 cells
treated with X-irradiation at various doses, described as
feeder cells. Proliferation of HUVEC-Fluc was finally
measured by bioluminescence imaging after a period of
coculture. In addition, to confirm the validity of employing
luciferase activity to measure HUVEC-Fluc proliferation,
we demonstrated that bioluminescence signals were
linearly correlated with HUVEC-Fluc number (Figure
1A). Subsequently, results manifested that HT-29 cells
receiving higher-dose irradiation (6 Gray [Gy] and 10 Gy)
significantly promoted HUVEC-Fluc proliferation when

percentage and FITC Annexin V and PI both positive
(end stage apoptosis or other death types) percentage of
HT-29 cells treated with 10 Gy irradiation significantly
increased in a time-dependent manner (Figure 2A, 2B).
Remarkably, the percentages of early apoptosis and late
apoptosis or other death types were respectively over
6-fold and 8-fold higher on day 4 after 10 Gy irradiation
than non-irradiated control (Figure 2B). Because caspase
3 plays a pivotal role in apoptosis execution phase, we
next investigated whether caspase 3 was activated in
HT-29 cells upon exposure to X-irradiation. Western
blot analysis displayed that cleaved caspase 3 (CC3)
expression gradually elevated in HT-29 cells after 10 Gy

X-irradiation induces caspase 3 activation in
dying tumor cells
It has been generally accepted that ionizing
irradiation can bring about tumor cell death [1]. To verify
whether HT-29 cell death occurs in reply to X-irradiation,
we utilized flow cytometry analysis by means of FITC
Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining.
Results showed that FITC Annexin V positive and
PI negative (generally considered as early apoptosis)

irradiation, indicating that 10 Gy irradiation did lead to
caspase 3 activation (Figure 2C). In addition, we also
reinforced CC3 expression in HT-29 cells treated with 10
Gy irradiation by means of confocal immunofluorescence
analysis (Figure 2D). Prominently, the percentage of CC3
positive cells 4 days after 10 Gy irradiation was over 24fold in comparison with non-irradiated control (Figure
2E). Overall, these data supported that 10 Gy irradiation
did contribute to caspase 3 activation in dying HT-29 cells.

What is the molecular mechanism underlying
proangiogenic role of dying tumor cells? Our previous
studies found that caspase 3 in dying tumor cells induced
by cytotoxic treatments (radiotherapy or chemotherapy)
is responsible for tumor cell repopulation [15, 26, 27],

so we wondered whether or not caspase 3 in dying tumor
cells also played a driving role in PIA. To examine our
hypothesis, we first inhibited proteolytic activity of caspase
3 by transducing a dominant-negative version of caspase 3
(C163A) [28, 29], designated as CASP3DN. Western blot
analysis confirmed the expression of CASP3DN in HT-29
cells by detecting the expression of hemagglutinin (HA)tag (Figure 3A), whose gene had been tandem inserted
into the lentiviral vector. Importantly, taking advantage
of the formerly-established in vitro coculture model, we
observed that 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 CASP3DN cells
showed significantly diminished proliferation-promoting

effect on HUVEC-Fluc when compared with equally
treated HT-29 cells (Figure 3B). Subsequently, we
examined the migratory capacity of HUVECs toward CM
from irradiated parental HT-29 cells and HT-29 CASP3DN
cells. We observed that migration of HUVECs toward
CM collected from 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 CASP3DN
cells was significantly inhibited, compared with CM from
10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 cells (Figure 3C). Next, to test
the ability of different CM to induce HUVECs to form
capillary-like structures, we performed tube formation
assay. As shown in Figure 3D, tube formation capacity
of HUVECs was greatly weakened when mixed with CM

VEGF-A induction and secretion in response to
X-irradiation is inhibited with caspase 3 inhibition

collected from 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 CASP3DN cells.
Taken together, these findings suggested that caspase 3 in
dying tumor cells performs a supportive role in promoting
surrounding angiogenic processes, including endothelial
cell proliferation, migration and tube formation.
Having shown that caspase 3 in dying tumor cells
mediates proangiogenic effects in vitro, we subsequently
explored whether caspase 3 in dying tumor cells mediates
proangiogenic response in vivo by performing matrigel
plug assay. We observed that blood vessel formation in
matrigel mixed with 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 CASP3DN
cells was significantly reduced, compared with blood
vessel formation in matrigel mixed with equally treated
HT-29 cells (Figure 3E). Further immunohistochemical
staining of matrigel plug sections for von Willebrand
factor (VWF) confirmed our macroscopic observation
(Figure 3E). Additionally, our results showed that skin
vascularization adjacent to plugs containing 10 Gyirradiated HT-29 CASP3DN cells was remarkably less
than control (Figure 3F). Hence, evidence in vivo also
indicated that caspase 3 in dying tumor cells plays a
supportive role in surrounding angiogenesis.

Our aforementioned results indicated that soluble
substances mediate proangiogenic response caused by
dying cells, so what are the downstream factors linking
caspase 3 with its proangiogenic role? Previous studies
have suggested that inhibition of caspase 3 activity
suppresses release of VEGF [31, 32], so we wondered
whether the impaired proangiogenic effects of irradiated
HT-29 CASP3DN cells were attributable to reduction of
VEGF. To test our hypothesis, we firstly performed PCR
assay to measure the relative expression of VEGF-A.
Our results showed that the relative expression of
VEGF-A mRNA was lower in HT-29 CASP3DN cells
than in HT-29 cells on day 2 since 10 Gy irradiation
(Figure 5A). In addition to mRNA level, using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) we also detected
the VEGF-A concentration of cell culture supernatant
at protein level. ELISA results showed that VEGF-A
concentration of supernatant from 10 Gy-irradiated HT29 cells with administration of Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase
3 inhibitor, was significantly lower than that from 10
Gy-irradiated HT-29 cells treated with vehicle control
(Figure 5B). Subsequently, another question struck us
that how caspase 3, a protease mediating apoptosis, could
regulate expression and secretion of VEGF-A. It has been
generally considered that Akt signaling has a pivotal
role in regulating VEGF expression under multifarious
circumstances [33]. To determine whether Akt activation
mediates VEGF-A expression regulation by caspase 3, we
performed Western blot analysis to detect phosphorylatedAkt (p-Akt) expression in parental HT-29 cells and HT-29
CASP3DN cells in response to irradiation. Intriguingly,
we observed that p-Akt induction in response to 10 Gy
irradiation was highly restricted in HT-29 CASP3DN cells,
in comparison with parental HT-29 cells (Figure 5C).

Proteolytic inactivity of caspase 3 suppresses
tumor angiogenesis and tumorigenesis
To further illustrate that caspase 3 in tumor cells
mediates angiogenesis, we carried out tumor xenograft
assay in nude mice using parental HT-29 cells and HT-29
CASP3DN cells in the absence of irradiation. Considering
that tumor cell death is common to occur during
tumorigenesis [30], we supposed that those naturally dying
tumor cells could also promote tumor angiogenesis despite
the absence of irradiation. According to our assumption,
subcutaneously implanted HT-29 CASP3DN cells, due to
dysfunction of caspase 3, would elicit less angiogenesis
and therefore diminish tumorigenicity, as compared to
parental HT-29 cells. Conforming to our speculation,
results demonstrated that HT-29 CASP3DN cells exhibited
significantly weakened tumor forming ability both in
tumor volume and tumor mass (Figure 4A, 4B). Moreover,
results from micro-computed tomography (micro-CT)
validated our observations (Figure 4C). What is more
important, immunohistochemical analysis of xenograft
tumor sections for endothelial markers, including VWF
and CD34, revealed that tumor angiogenesis was less in
HT-29 CASP3DN cell xenograft than in parental HT29 cell xenograft (Figure 4D, 4E). Next, consistent with
our hypothesis, immunohistochemical staining for CC3
revealed that the CC3 expression was higher in parental
HT-29 cell xenograft than in HT-29 CASP3DN cell
xenograft (Figure 4F). Thereby, these data suggested that
caspase 3 deactivation may curb tumor angiogenesis and
therefore inhibit tumor growth.

VEGF-A blockade represses proangiogenic effects
of dying tumor cells
As a further step, in order to substantiate that
VEGF-A mediates proangiogenic response induced by
dying tumor cells, we investigated whether proangiogenic
response attenuated when VEGF-A was blocked.
Ranibizumab, a neutralizing antibody against VEGF-A,
remarkably damaged the proliferation-stimulating
effect of dying HT-29 cells on HUVEC-Fluc, while the
concentration of Ranibizumab used did not interfere in
HUVEC-Fluc proliferation alone (Figure 6A). Apart from
utilizing a neutralizing antibody against VEGF-A, we
also pharmacologically tested whether VEGF-A mediated
proliferation-promoting effect of dying tumor cells on
HUVEC-Fluc. Results showed that Ki8751, a VEGF
receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibitor, noticeably inhibited
32359

Oncotarget

DISCUSSION

proliferation-stimulating effect of dying HT-29 cells and
the concentration of Ki8751 did not affect HUVEC-Fluc
proliferation alone (Figure 6B). Additionally, Ki8751 of
1 μmol also impaired the migratory ability of HUVEC
toward CM collected from 10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 cells
(Figure 6C). Accordingly, these findings suggested that
VEGF-A is a possible downstream molecule of caspase 3,
mediating the proangiogenic effects of dying tumor cells
via interacting with VEGFR2.
In summary, based on these results, we finally would
like to propose a novel caspase 3 mediated proangiogenic
mechanism accounting for PIA, of which a schematic
representation was shown (Figure 6D).

During cytotoxic treatments like radiotherapy,
tumor cell death occurs. Our findings surprisingly found
that dying tumor cells promote PIA through a caspase 3
dependent mechanism. Induction of tumor cell apoptosis
has been a vital strategy in cancer therapy, whereas
our results counterintuitively suggest that apoptotic
tumor cells enhance surrounding angiogenesis, possibly
mediating radioresistance or tumor relapse due to the fact
that tumor growth is tightly reliable on angiogenesis. In
this work, we demonstrated that X-irradiation-induced
dying tumor cells markedly enhanced surrounding

endothelial cell proliferation and migration and bolstered
endothelial cell survival in vivo. What is important, our
results both in vitro and in vivo unexpectedly illustrated
that caspaes 3, a key executioner of apoptosis, in dying
tumor cells mediated their proangiogenic effects.
Furthermore, caspase 3 inactivity significantly suppressed
tumor angiogenesis in xenograft model and tumor growth.
In the end, our results unexpectedly revealed that VEGF-A
induction and secretion in response to irradiation was
inhibited when caspase 3 was deactivated and VEGF-A

blockade attenuated proangiogenic effects of dying tumor
cells.
Similar to our findings, one study, though not from
cancer research area, has also linked caspase-3 with
angiogenesis. The study reported that the proangiogenic
effects of lipid-injured hepatocytes are dependent on
caspase 3 activity, since inhibition of caspase 3 activity
reduces release of proangiogenic microparticles from
injured hepatocytes [31]. In addition, though it seems to
be paradoxical to link caspase 3, an execution molecule

of cell apoptosis, with proangiogenic response, there
have been accumulating studies clarifying diverse
growth-promoting effects of caspase 3, such as fibrosis
[34], osteoclastogenesis [32], tissue regeneration [35],
oncogenic transformation [36] and tumor repopulation
[15]. Consequently, we would like to propose a
bold hypothesis that this novel caspase 3-regulating
angiogenesis pathway may be a conservative mechanism
involving in various pathophysiological processes like
wound healing, fracture healing, tissue regeneration, and
tumor repopulation.
In our study, we showed that caspase 3 inactivity
extenuated irradiation-induced VEGF-A upregulation.
Consistent with our results, another study demonstrated
that pharmacologically suppressing caspase 3 activity
inhibits fatigue-induced VEGF upreguation in osteocytes.
Regarding the potential mechanism accounting for
VEGF-A regulation by caspase 3, we demonstrated that
Akt activation induced by irradiation was mitigated when
caspase 3 was deactivated. Another possible mechanism
explaining how caspase 3 modulates VEGF expression
may involve protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Numerous studies
have indicated that caspase 3-dependent PKCδ activation
mediates apoptosis under various circumstances [37-41].
Moreover, PKCδ has been reported to tightly regulate
VEGF expression [42]. Therefore, it would be worthwhile
to determine in future studies whether caspase 3-dependent
PKCδ activation mediates proangiogenic effects of dying
tumor cells, by regulating VEGF expression.
This study implicates that combination of
radiotherapy and caspase 3 inhibitors may act as a
more effective strategy for cancer treatment, through
mitigating PIA, which is required for tumor regrowth.
Interestingly, our previous study has already illustrated
caspase 3 inhibition suppresses tumor repopulation
during radiotherapy. It is highly possible that alternative
mechanism interpreting that caspase 3 inhibition restricts
tumor repopulation is due to quelled angiogenesis after
irradiation. Indeed, there has been evidence showing
that combination of radiotherapy and M867, a selective
inhibitor of caspase 3, effectively extends tumor growth
delay in mouse xenograft model, with great reduction of
vascular density [43].
Furthermore, the VEGF-mediated post-irradiation
proangiogenic mechanism revealed in this paper
supported the previously proposed notion of therapyinduced tumor progression via VEGF [44]. Indeed, it has
been suggested that Avastin (bevacizumab) potentiates
chemotherapy by hampering VEGF-mediated reactive
resistance to therapy, rather than directly inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis [45]. Also, there is evidence suggesting that
radiotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents (for
example, bevacizumab and VEGFR inhibitors) would be
a promising therapeutic modality [46, 47]. Considering
that p-Akt may mediate irradiation-induced VEGF
upregulation, it is conceivable that rapamycin, blocking
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Akt/mTOR pathway, combined with radiotherapy may
serve as a novel treatment strategy for cancer through
better targeting tumor vasculature [48, 49].
We therefore hope that this novel caspase
3-mediated proangiogenic pathway could provide more
efficacious and multifold therapeutic targets for cancer
radiotherapy or even other irradiation-induced vascular
proliferative diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and cell irradiation
HUVECs were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, life technologies,
Auckland, NZ). Human colorectal cancer cell line HT29 was available from the Chinese Academy of Science
(Shanghai, China) and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 10% FBS. X-ray irradiation of cells
was performed with an Oncor linear accelerator (Siemens,
Amberg, Germany), of which the dose rate is about 3.6
Gy/min.

Gene transduction
To transduce exogenous genes into target cells,
we used the pLEX lentiviral vector system obtained
commercially from Open Biosystem (Huntsville, AL,
USA). The firefly luciferase (Fluc) and green fluorescent
protein (GFP) fusion gene [15] was kindly provided by
Prof. Chuan-Yuan Li and delivered into HUVECs to create
HUVEC-Fluc. The dominant-negative caspase 3 [15,
36] with a key cysteine mutation in the catalytic domain
of caspase 3 (C163A) was also obtained from Prof.
Chuan-Yuan Li’s laboratory. Live, replication-deficient
recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing exogenous genes
were packaged in 293T cells following manufacturer’s
instructions. HUVEC-Fluc, HT-29 CASP3DN were
acquired through lentivirus infection and puromycin
selection at 3 μg/ml.

Endothelial cell growth measurement in vitro
and in vivo with bioluminescence imaging and
fluorescence imaging
In vitro, HUVEC-Fluc (100-500) were seeded onto
a larger number (2-2.5 × 105) of differentially irradiated
HT-29 cells (feeder cells) within 24 hours since irradiation
in 24-well plates or hanging cell culture inserts of 0.4 μm
pore size (PIHT12R48; Millipore, MA, USA). Culture

Immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) analysis

medium was replaced with fresh 2% FBS DMEM every
2 days. After a coculture period of 9-14 days, to measure
luciferase activity, we added D-Luciferin potassium
(bc219; Synchem UG & Co. KG, Felsberg/Altenburg,
Germany) diluted in PBS (0.15 mg/ml) into each well
before bioluminescence imaging.
In vivo, male nude mice (4-6 weeks old) were used.
We injected a small number (1 × 105) of HUVEC-Fluc
either alone or mixed with a large number (1 × 106) of
10 Gy-irradiated HT-29 cells. Cells were resuspended
in PBS and 100 μl cell suspension was injected
subcutaneously into hind legs of nude mice. Before
non-invasive bioluminescence imaging, mice were
injected intraperitoneally with 150mg/kg D-luciferin
potassium dissolved in deionized water (30 mg/ml) and
then anesthetized with continuous flow of isoflurane. To
make bioluminescent signals from different batches of
mice comparable, we kept the time between D-luciferin
potassium injection and imaging at 10 minutes.
Bioluminescence imaging machines used in this
study were NC100 instrument (Berthold Technologies
GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and
SPECTRAL Ami X (Spectral Instruments Imaging,
Tucson, AZ, USA). After images were taken, we employed
manufacturer-supplied software to process images for
quantitative data.
For GFP fluorescence imaging of live HUVECFluc in vitro, a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) was used.

Xenograft tumor and matrigel plug sections were
deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with addition
of ethanol. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed
in Tris-EDTA buffer. Tissue sections were subjected
to 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous
peroxidase activity and then blocked with blocking buffer
(P0102; Beyotime, China). Slides were incubated with
primary antibodies against CD31 (sc-1506; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA), VWF (sc-14014;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD34 (#3569; Cell Signaling
Technology, MA, USA), and GFP (ARH2068; Antibody
Revolution, San Diego, CA, USA) at 4 °C overnight.
Sections were washed three times for 5 minutes each time.
For immunofluorescence analysis, fluorescein-labeled
secondary antibodies (20014; 20106; Biotium, Hayward,
CA, USA) were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.
Before immunofluorescence analysis with a confocal
microscope, cells were counterstained with DAPI. For
immunohistochemistry analysis, Real Envision Detection
Kit (GK500710; Gene Tech, Shanghai, China) was used
and signals were visualized through the diaminobenzidine
reaction.

Flow cytometric analysis
Cell apoptosis was analyzed with FITC Annexin V
apoptosis detection kit (556547; BD PharmingenTM, San
Diego, CA, USA). Procedures were carried out according
to the technical data sheet from the kit. Briefly, cells were
trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in binding buffer.
After FITC Annexin V and PI staining for 15 minutes,
apoptosis was detected using Accuri C6 Flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, CA, USA).

Conditioned medium collection
Conditioned medium was prepared mainly as
previously described [50]. In brief, an equal number of
tumor cells were seeded in cell culture dishes overnight.
Culture medium was replaced by complete medium before
irradiation. 48 hours after irradiation, culture medium was
harvested, centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5min, filtered with
0.22 μm filter unit (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)
and stored at -80 °C until use.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed mainly as
previously described [51]. Proteins were extracted,
separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The
membranes were blotted with primary antibodies for
β-actin, caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, HA-tag, GAPDH
and p-Akt (#4967; #9665; #9661; #3724; #5174;
#4060; Cell Signaling Technology) and then secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA). Finally,
ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate
(P90719, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) was
utilized to visualize signals on PVDF membranes.

HUVEC migration assay
HUVEC migration was performed with hanging
cell culture inserts of 8 μm pore size (PIEP12R48;
Millipore) for 24-well plates as previously described
[50]. Mainly, 600 μl conditioned medium was placed
into the lower chamber of every well and 200 μl serum
free DMEM containing HUVECs (5 × 104) added on the
top of inserts. After 6 hours, cells staying in the inserts
were removed gently with cotton swabs. Transmigrated
HUVECs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then
stained with crystal violet. Number of migratory HUVECs
was measured by counting in five random fields under
microscope.

Confocal microscopy for cleaved caspase 3

Quantitative real-time PCR

HT-29 cells were seeded into 35 mm glass bottom
dishes with 10 mm micro-well (D35-10-1-N; In Vitro
Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) overnight. Having
undergone 10 Gy irradiation, cells were rinsed with PBS
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes.
Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton
X-100 diluted in PBS for 15 minutes and then blocked
with blocking buffer (Beyotime) for 1 hour. Then, cells
were incubated with primary antibody against cleaved
caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 °C overnight.
After washed with PBS three times for 5 minutes each
time, cells were subjected to fluorescent secondary
antibody (20125; Biotium) at room temperature for 1
hour. Before confocal microscopy analysis, cells were
counterstained with DAPI.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells
using RNAsimple Total RNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing,
China). The reverse transcription reaction was carried
out using 1 μg of total RNA with PrimeScript™ RT
Master Mix (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed with SYBR® Premix
Ex Taq™ II (Takara). Briefly, 1 μl cDNA was added
per 20 μl reaction with sequence-specific primers and
SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II. The specific forward
and reverse primers of VEGF-A (NM_001171627)
were 5’-AGGGCAGAATCATCACGAAGT-3’ and
5’-AGGGTCTCGATTGGATGGCA-3’. For GAPDH
(NM_001256799), the specific forward and reverse
primers were 5’-GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT-3’
and 5’-GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG-3’. VEGF-A
gene expression was calculated according to the 2-ΔΔCt
method.

Tube formation assay

ELISA

Tube formation assay was performed in 48-well
plates. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was thawed at 4 °C
overnight on ice. 150 μl matrigel was coated into each
well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. Once matrigel
solidified, 500 μl conditioned medium containing 6 × 104
HUVECs was added on the matrigel surface with precooled pipettes. After 6 to 8 hours, tube formation was
photographed with inverted phase contrast microscope.
For data analysis, number of formed loops was calculated.

HT-29 cells were seeded onto 60 mm cell culture
dishes overnight. 4 hours before irradiation, HT-29 cells
were administrated with 15 μmol Z-DEVD-FMK (14414;
Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) or vehicle control. 1 day
and 2 days after irradiation, cell culture supernatant was
collected, centrifuged and stored at -80 °C until use.
Human VEGF Valukine ELISA Kit (VAL106; R&D
Systems, MN, USA) was used to evaluate the VEGF-A
concentration of cell culture supernatant. Procedures were
conducted in strict accordance with the manuscript in the
kit.

Matrigel plug assay
For matrigel plug assay, male nude mice (4-6
weeks old) were used. 500 μl matrigel mixed with 2 × 106
either HT-29 or HT-29 CASP3DN cells treated with 10
Gy irradiation was implanted subcutaneously into either
flank of mice, respectively. 8 days after injection, mice
were sacrificed and plugs were harvested. Skin vasculature
adjacent to plugs was photographed.

Other drugs used
Ranibizumab, also known as Lucentis, was available
from Novartis (Switzerland). Ki8751 was available from
Selleckchem (TX, USA).

Tumor xenograft experiment

Ethics

Male nude mice (4-6 weeks old) were used. 2 × 106
either HT-29 or HT-29 CASP3DN cells were resuspended
in 100 μl PBS and injected subcutaneously into either
flank of mice, respectively. Tumor size was measured
every week until 6 weeks and tumor volume (V) was
calculated using the formula: V = 0.5 × length × width2.
Micro-CT (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) was performed before
sacrificing mice.

All animal procedures were approved by the Animal
Care Committee at Shanghai General Hospital. We made
every effort to reduce the number of animals used and
their discomfort during experiment.
