Abstract
Oncogenic mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT play an important role in the pathogenesis of
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, systemic mastocytosis, and some acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Although
juxtamembrane mutations commonly detected in gastrointestinal stromal tumor are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the kinase domain mutations frequently encountered in systemic mastocytosis and AML confer resistance and are largely unresponsive to targeted inhibition by the existing agent imatinib. In this study,
we show that myeloid cells expressing activated c-KIT mutants that are imatinib sensitive (V560G) or imatinib
resistant (D816V) can inhibit the tumor suppressor activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This effect was
associated with the reduced expression of PP2A structural (A) and regulatory subunits (B55α, B56α, B56γ, and
B56δ). Overexpression of PP2A-Aα in D816V c-KIT cells induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation. In addition, pharmacologic activation of PP2A by FTY720 reduced proliferation, inhibited clonogenic potential, and
induced apoptosis of mutant c-KIT+ cells, while having no effect on wild-type c-KIT cells or empty vector
controls. FTY720 treatment caused the dephosphorylation of the D816V c-KIT receptor and its downstream
signaling targets pAkt, pSTAT5, and pERK1/2. Additionally, in vivo administration of FTY720 delayed the
growth of V560G and D816V c-KIT tumors, inhibited splenic and bone marrow infiltration, and prolonged
survival. Our findings show that PP2A inhibition is essential for c-KIT–mediated tumorigenesis, and that
reactivating PP2A may offer an attractive strategy to treat drug-resistant c-KIT+ cancers. Cancer Res; 70(13);

Introduction
c-KIT is a type 3 receptor tyrosine kinase that is characterized by five extracellular immunogloblin-like domains and an
intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain (1). Binding of stem
cell factor to c-KIT activates multiple signaling pathways important for cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival
(2). Gain-of-function c-KIT mutations have been documented
in core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML;
ref. 3), systemic mastocytosis (4), gastrointestinal stromal tuAuthors' Affiliations: 1School of Biomedical Sciences, University of

mors (5), testicular seminoma (6), and melanoma (7). In
gastrointestinal stromal tumor samples ∼85% of c-KIT aberrations are located in the juxtamembrane domain (e.g.,
V560G; ref. 5), whereas the majority of CBF-AML and systemic mastocytosis patients express kinase domain mutations
(e.g., D816V). In most cases, the presence of an activating
c-KIT mutation is associated with a higher relapse rate and
reduced survival compared with patients expressing the wildtype (WT) receptor (8).
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has shown remarkable success in treating metastatic gastrointestinal stromal
tumor patients that harbor juxtamembrane c-KIT mutations
(9). In contrast, mutations involving the kinase domain are
resistant to imatinib inhibition, and as such, c-KIT+ CBFAML and systemic mastocytosis patients are unresponsive
to imatinib therapy (10, 11). Recent clinical trials with the
second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (SPRYCEL, Bristol-Myers Squib) have also reported disappointing
results (12). To improve treatment outcomes, a greater understanding of the signaling pathways activated downstream
of c-KIT is required.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine
phosphatase that negatively regulates numerous signal transduction pathways that are involved in cell cycle progression,

The PP2A Activator FTY720 Inhibits c-KIT+ Cancers

DNA replication, and apoptosis (13). PP2A is emerging as an
important tumor suppressor that is mutated or downregulated in several cancers including breast, lung, and colon
(14–16). It is also inactivated by the oncogenic tyrosine kinase, BCR/ABL, in chronic myeloid leukemia (17). As BCR/
ABL and c-KIT activate similar oncogenic pathways, we hypothesized that PP2A may also be regulated by c-KIT. In this
study, we report that PP2A activity is inhibited in myeloid precursors expressing imatinib-sensitive (V560G) and imatinibresistant (D816V) mutant c-KIT. Using in vitro and in vivo
models of c-KIT tumorigenesis, we show that overexpression
of PP2A-Aα, or reactivation of PP2A with FTY720 (fingolimod;
Novartis; refs. 18, 19), inhibits c-KIT–mediated growth and
survival. Furthermore, FTY720 exhibits selectivity for activating c-KIT mutations over the WT c-KIT receptor. As mutant cKIT is the driving force behind multiple cancer types, these
data suggest that PP2A activation may be a powerful strategy
for the treatment of c-KIT+ malignancies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, retroviral infection, and patient samples
The FDC-P1 mouse growth factor–dependent myeloid cell
line (20) expressing empty vector (EV), WT, and the oncogenic V560G and D816V mutant forms of human c-KIT have
been previously described (21). The expression of c-KIT
was routinely monitored by flow cytometry (21). The
Kasumi-1 myeloid leukemia cell line (22) and HMC-1 human
mast cell lines (23) expressing c-KIT mutations have been
previously described. The human AML cell lines MV4-11
(24) and THP-1 (25) were a kind gift from Dr. Kyu-Tae Kim
(University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales,
Australia). Retroviral expression vectors pMIG EV and pMIG
PP2A-Aα (Addgene plasmid 9044 and 10884; deposited by
Prof. William C. Hahn, Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston,
MA) have been previously reported (26). FDC-P1 D816V
c-KIT cells expressing pMIG EV or PP2A-Aα were generated
by retroviral transduction followed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting–mediated sorting of green fluorescent protein–
positive cells (27).
A bone marrow sample was obtained from a 71-year-old
male CBF-AML patient according to institutional guidelines.
Studies were approved by the Royal Adelaide Hospital Human Ethics Committee. Mononuclear cells were isolated by
Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation, washed, and
resuspended at 2 × 105/mL in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's
medium/0.5% fetal bovine serum. c-KIT mutation analysis
was performed using high-resolution melt analysis and direct
sequencing as described (28).
Drug treatments
Imatinib was provided by Prof. Bruce Lyons (University of
Tasmania, Hobart, Australia) and resuspended in milli-Q water at 10 mmol/L for cell culture or 10 mg/mL for in vivo administration. For cell culture, FTY720 (Cayman Chemicals)
and FTY720-P (Echelon Biosciences, Inc.) were dissolved in
DMSO at 50 mmol/L stock. For in vivo administration,
FTY720 was prepared daily in normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl)

www.aacrjournals.org

at 1 mg/mL. Okadaic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to
1 mmol/L.
Phosphatase activity assay
PP2A activity was determined using the PP2Ac immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit, as per the manufacturer's
instructions (Millipore). The percentage of phosphatase activity was determined by dividing the free phosphate (PO4) of the
test cells by that of the nontreated EV cells.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.4), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 5 mmol/L
EDTA supplemented with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na2VO4, 20 μg/mL leupeptin, 20 μg/mL aprotinin, and 25 μL/mL complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Total protein (50 μg) was separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(GE Healthcare). For immunoblotting, the antibodies used
were as follows: anti-PP2A-A (Calbiochem); anti–PP2A-B56α,
anti–PP2A-B56γ3, anti–PP2A-B56δ, and anti–PP2A-B56ε (Novus Biochemicals); anti-PP2AcY307 (Epitomics), anti-I2PP2A
(SET; clone H-120; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pAktT308,
anti-pBADS112, anti-pERK1/2T202/Y204, anti-pMEKS221, antipp38MAPK T180/Y182 , and anti-pSTAT5 Y694 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.); and anti-actin (Sigma). Affinity-purified
rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a PP2AB55α peptide (CFSQVKGAVDDDV; ref. 29) and a PP2Ac peptide (PHVTRRTPDYFL; ref. 30). Membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and protein-antibody complexes visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Images were
captured with a FUJIFILM LAS-3000 detection system and analyzed using Multi Gauge v3.0. Immunoprecipitation of c-KIT
and detection of tyrosine phosphorylation was performed as
previously described (31).
Immunofluorescent staining
Cells were cytocentrifuged onto a glass slide, fixed in 3.7%
formaldehyde/PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature, and
permeabilized in 0.1% Triton/PBS for 3 minutes. The slides
were blocked in 10% FCS/PBS for 20 minutes, incubated with
either 1:500 anti–PP2A-Aα (clone 6F9; Covance) or anti–
cleaved caspase-3 (clone Asp175; Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.) for 1 hour, then with 1:1,000 dilution of the appropriate
Alexa Fluor-555–conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen),
followed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) mounting
(Invitrogen). Images were obtained using a FlouView
FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) and the FV10-ASW
v2.0 software (Olympus).
Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle
FDC-P1 and human AML cell lines (2 × 104/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate with appropriate factors and the indicated
concentrations of drug for 48 hours. Proliferation was assessed
using the CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The
concentration of drug that reduces cell viability by 50%
(ID50) was analyzed using cubic spline regression (32). Assays

were plated in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times.
Apoptosis was measured using the Annexin V FITC apoptosis
detection kit (BD Biosciences). Samples were run on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and data were analyzed using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For cell cycle analysis, cells
(5 × 105) were resuspended in 0.5 mL 0.1% glucose/PBS with
2.5 mL 70% ethanol for 1 hour at 4°C. Cells were washed in PBS
then incubated with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) and 0.2 mg/mL RNase (Fermentas) for 30 minutes
at 37°C. Samples were analyzed on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences), and histograms were fitted for cell cycle ratios using
ModFit LT v3.2 (Verity Software House). Four independent experiments were performed for each assay. For the AML patient
sample, cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 10 μmol/L
FTY720, and AML blast survival was measured at 24 hours
by costaining with Annexin V FITC (Roche). The ID50 of apoptosis induction by FTY720 was calculated as above.
Clonogenic assay
Cells (2 × 102) were plated into 1% methylcellulose medium (MethoCult; Stem Cell Technologies, Inc.) in the presence
of appropriate factors and indicated drug concentrations.
Colonies (>50 cells) were scored 7 days later. Assays were
performed in triplicate and repeated three times.
Syngeneic mouse model
Eight- to 10-week-old female DBA/2J mice (Animal Resources Centre) were s.c. injected on both flanks with 5 × 106
FDC-P1 V560G c-KIT or 3.5 × 106 FDC-P1 D816V c-KIT cells
in 200 μL 1:1 PBS/Matrigel (Trevigen). When tumors reached
a volume of ∼200 mm3 (day 5), mice were randomized into
two groups that received daily i.p. injections of either saline
or 10 mg/kg FTY720. Tumor volume was determined using
the formula: 0.5 × length (mm) × width2 (mm). On day 14,
three mice from FDC-P1 V560G c-KIT and six mice from
FDC-P1 D816V c-KIT–injected groups were sacrificed. The remaining mice were used for survival studies and culled when
tumor volumes reached ∼2,100 mm3. The tumors and organs
were fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemical staining of anti-human c-KIT (CD117; DAKO)
was detected with the Vectastain Elite ABC kit and diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and imaged with a
ColorView II camera and analySIS software (Olympus Soft
Imaging Systems GmbH). Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining using an In situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche). Images were acquired with an Axioplan 2
imaging system and merged with Axio Vision v4.7 (Carl
Zeiss). All animal studies were performed with approval
of The University of Newcastle Animal Care and Ethics
Committee.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance between samples was assessed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Survival probabilities between groups were determined by the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences in survival distributions were evaluated by the log-rank test. Values shown are the mean + SEM.

Results
c-KIT inhibits PP2A activity and alters the expression
of PP2A subunits
To evaluate whether PP2A is regulated by c-KIT, we measured the activity of PP2Ac immunoprecipitates extracted
from FDC-P1 mouse myeloid cells expressing EV, WT cKIT, the oncogenic imatinib-sensitive juxtamembrane
V560G c-KIT mutant, or the imatinib-resistant kinase domain D816V c-KIT mutant (21). The phosphatase activity
of PP2A was significantly reduced to 72% and 65% in cells
expressing V560G and D816V c-KIT, respectively, compared
with EV controls (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, activating
mutations of c-KIT reduce PP2A activity.
The cellular localization and substrate specificity of PP2A
is regulated by posttranslational modification of the catalytic
subunit and binding of regulatory B subunits (33, 34). To investigate the mechanism by which constitutive c-KIT activation inhibits PP2A, expression of PP2A subunits were
examined by immunoblotting. There was no change in the
total expression or phosphorylation of PP2Ac in cells expressing WT or mutant c-KIT (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1). In
contrast, protein levels of PP2A-A, B55α, B56α, and B56δ
were significantly decreased in mutant c-KIT+ cells. Furthermore, B56γ was barely detectable in mutant c-KIT+ cells,
whereas WT c-KIT cells expressed a lower molecular weight
isoform (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1). No change was observed in B56ε. B55β and B55γ are neuronal specific isoforms and are not expressed in the FDC-P1 cells (data not
shown). Quantitative real-time PCR showed no significant
difference in PP2A subunit mRNA levels between EV controls
and mutant c-KIT+ cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, total expression of the PP2A inhibitory protein, SET, was
elevated in the mutant c-KIT + cells, together with the
presence of a lower molecular weight isoform (Fig. 1).
Overexpression of PP2A-Aα reverses the tumorigenic
phenotype
To investigate the functional importance of reduced PP2A
expression in oncogenic c-KIT+ cells, the pMIG vector encoding the PP2A-Aα subunit or corresponding EV control was
introduced into the FDC-P1 D816V c-KIT cells by retroviral
transduction. After 24 hours (day 0), the top 10% of GFP+
cells were selected from a heterogeneous population, and
the presence of Aα was confirmed by immunofluorescent
staining on cytospins (Fig. 2A). On day 0, the viability of
the D816V c-KIT PP2A-Aα cells, as determined by trypan
blue exclusion, was 55%, markedly lower than 85% observed
for the EV control population. It should be noted that for
both cell lines, only the viable population was sorted for subsequent experiments. Notably, the percentage of Annexin V+
cells at day 0 was elevated 2-fold in the PP2A-Aα population
compared with the EV controls (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the
percentage of cleaved caspase-3–positive cells increased
from 4% in the EV controls to 16% in the PP2A-Aα cells

The PP2A Activator FTY720 Inhibits c-KIT+ Cancers

(Fig. 2B). Accordingly, overexpression of PP2A-Aα inhibited
the proliferation of D816V c-KIT cells (Fig. 2C), supporting
the hypothesis that the functional loss of PP2A contributes
to c-KIT–mediated tumorigenesis.
Reactivation of PP2A inhibits the proliferation of
mutant c-KIT+ cells
To determine the biological relevance and potential therapeutic implications of PP2A loss-of-function in c-KIT+ malignancies, we used the pharmacologic activator, FTY720
(18, 19). PP2A activity was enhanced 1.7-fold by FTY720
(2.5 μmol/L; 6 h) in cells expressing V560G c-KIT and 2.4fold in FTY720-treated D816V c-KIT cells compared with
nontreated controls (Fig. 3A). In contrast, minimal effect
on PP2A activity was seen in WT c-KIT cells or EV controls
(Fig. 3A).
FTY720 is phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase 2
to yield FTY720-P, which binds to sphingosine-1-phosphate–
specific G protein–coupled receptors (S1PR) and induces signaling that regulates a variety of cellular processes (35). To
determine whether reactivation of PP2A is dependent on

www.aacrjournals.org

S1PR-induced signaling, we incubated the cells with FTY720P (2.5 μmol/L; 6 h). In all cell lines, PP2A activity did not increase (Fig. 3A), suggesting that nonphosphorylated FTY720
is responsible for PP2A reactivation.
The effect of FTY720 on viable cell number was determined using a colorimetric assay. Importantly, the ID50 values for V560G and D816V c-KIT cells were significantly
reduced compared with WT c-KIT and EV cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3A; Table 1A). Treatment with a chemically
distinct PP2A activator, forskolin (17), showed similar results,
whereby mutant c-KIT cells were more sensitive to reactivation of PP2A than EV controls (Table 1A). Incubation with
FTY720-P up to 20 μmol/L had no effect on the growth of
FDC-P1 cell lines (Table 1A). That FTY720 and forskolin have
distinct mechanisms of action, yet both activate PP2A,
strongly suggests that the cytotoxicity observed in mutant
c-KIT+ cells is due to the enhanced activation of PP2A. Furthermore, this effect is not mediated through S1PR signaling.
We then tested the efficacy of FTY720 on a panel of human
AML cell lines. The human mast cell line HMC-1.1 expresses
a V560G c-KIT mutation, and HMC-1.2 expresses an additional D816V c-KIT mutation (23). The Kasumi-1 CBF-AML
cell line harbors a t(8;21) translocation together with a
N822K c-KIT mutation (22). Each of these cell lines displayed
increased sensitivity to FTY720 than human AML cell lines
expressing WT c-KIT (MV4-11 and THP-1; Supplementary
Fig. S3B; Table 1B; refs. 24 and 25). Furthermore, blasts isolated from a CBF-AML patient with inv(16) and D816V c-KIT
displayed remarkable sensitivity to apoptosis induction by
FTY720 with an ID50 of 0.6 μmol/L (Table 1C). These data
show that myeloid malignancies characterized by mutant
c-KIT are sensitive to FTY720.
FTY720 induces apoptosis and inhibits the clonogenic
potential of mutant c-KIT cells
The ability of FTY720 to induce apoptosis in c-KIT–
expressing myeloid precursors was investigated by staining
with Annexin V (Fig. 3B). In both the mutant c-KIT cell
lines, FTY720 (2.5 μmol/L) markedly increased the percentage of Annexin V + cells at 24 hours compared with
nontreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 3B) and induced a shift into the sub-G0 phase at 36 hours (Fig. 3C).
Importantly, FDC-P1 EV or WT c-KIT cells remained unaffected by the presence of 2.5 μmol/L FTY720 (Fig. 3B and
C) up to 48 hours (data not shown). Accordingly, the clonogenic potential of FDC-P1 cells expressing V560G c-KIT or
D816V c-KIT was significantly inhibited by 2.5 μmol/L
FTY720 (Fig. 3D). In contrast, no difference was observed between nontreated and FTY720-treated WT c-KIT cells or EV
controls (Fig. 3D).
To confirm that the observed cytotoxic effects were a
consequence of PP2A reactivation by FTY720, FDC-P1
D816V c-KIT cells were cotreated with the serine-threonine
phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (0.25 nmol/L) at a concentration that specifically inhibits the activity of PP2A
(36). Importantly, the addition of okadaic acid rescued the
colony formation of FTY720-treated cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the clonogenic potential of V560G and D816V c-KIT

cells treated with 2.5 μmol/L FTY720-P resembled that of
nontreated controls (Fig. 3D). Together these data indicate
that FTY720 mediates its effects on FDC-P1 mutant c-KIT
cells by specifically reactivating PP2A.
Reactivation of PP2A dephosphorylates the c-KIT
receptor and its downstream signaling targets
c-KIT activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation
(37). To determine if PP2A reactivation affects c-KIT phosphorylation, the receptor was immunoprecipitated from
FDC-P1 cells treated with FTY720 (2.5 μmol/L; 6, 12, and
24 h). FTY720 caused the marked inhibition of V560G and
D816V c-KIT phosphorylation at 6 hours (Fig. 4A). In contrast, phosphorylation of the WT c-KIT receptor remained
stable, consistent with these cells being less responsive to
FTY720 (Fig. 4A).
We next analyzed the effect of FTY720 on known PP2A
and c-KIT signaling targets. Phosphorylation of Akt, STAT5,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38MAPK,
and BAD in WT and V560G c-KIT–expressing cells was undetectable (data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports (21, 38, 39). As such, our investigations focused
on the D816V c-KIT cells, which showed reduced phosphor-

ylation of pAkt, pSTAT5, pERK1/2, pp38MAPK, and pBAD
with FTY720 treatment (2.5 μmol/L; 12 h; Supplementary
Fig. S5; Fig. 4B). No change in pMEK was observed. Although
the D816V cells expressed increased total levels of several
proteins, the expression did not alter with FTY720 (Supplementary Fig. S6; Fig. 4B). Importantly, FTY720 did not affect
signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), or
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the
EV controls (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that PP2A inhibition is required for sustained c-KIT activation, and that enhancing the activity of PP2A results in the dephosphorylation
of D816V c-KIT and its downstream targets.
FTY720 delays mutant c-KIT tumor growth in vivo
The efficacy of FTY720 against established tumors expressing either the V560G or D816V mutant c-KIT was evaluated
in a syngeneic mouse model. For mice harboring V560G
c-KIT tumors, FTY720 treatment prolonged their survival
compared with nontreated controls (21 d versus 24 d; P <
0.05; Fig. 5A). Similarly, for tumors expressing D816V c-KIT,
the median survival for FTY720-treated mice was 22 days, a
significant increase from 18 days for saline-treated mice

FTY720 or FTY720-P (2.5 μmol/L; 6 h). PP2A activity was determined by incubating the isolated PP2Ac complex with a PP2A-specific phosphopeptide and

(P < 0.01; Fig. 5A). As expected, imatinib was effective against
V560G c-KIT tumors only (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S7).
At day 14, a subset of mice from each group were sacrificed. Compared with saline-treated mice, FTY720 significantly reduced the tumor mass in the V560G c-KIT and
D816V c-KIT groups (Fig. 5B). Consistent with these observations, a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed in tumors treated with FTY720 compared with saline
controls (Supplementary Figs. S8 and S9; Fig. 5C).
The D816V c-KIT tumors grew at a faster rate than those
expressing V560G c-KIT (Supplementary Fig. S7). Consistent
with this observation, saline-treated mice from the D816V
c-KIT group developed splenomegaly by day 14, as indicated
by an increase in splenic weight compared with age-matched
controls (Fig. 5D). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a
disruption of splenic architecture and intense c-KIT–positive
staining in saline-treated mice only (Fig. 5D). Importantly,

the spleen size of FTY720-treated mice was significantly lower than saline-treated mice; the histopathology resembled
that of age-matched controls; and the presence of c-KIT+
cells was almost nondetectable. Similar results were observed in the bone marrow (Fig. 5D). It should be noted that
splenomegaly was not observed at day 14 in mice injected
with V560G c-KIT cells (Supplementary Fig. S10). No signs
of acute or delayed toxicity were observed with FTY720
treatment (data not shown).

Discussion
This study has shown that inhibition of PP2A is a crucial
mediator of c-KIT tumorigenesis. Constitutive activation of
c-KIT through the juxtamembrane domain mutation V560G
or the kinase domain mutation D816V impairs the activity

of the tumor suppressor PP2A. The mechanism of PP2A
inhibition is associated with the decreased expression of
PP2A structural and regulatory subunits. Furthermore, pharmacologic reactivation of PP2A specifically reduces the

growth and survival of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant c-KIT+ cells. Thus, specific activation of PP2A
provides a unique target for therapeutic intervention in cancers expressing mutant c-KIT.

The PP2A Activator FTY720 Inhibits c-KIT+ Cancers

Regulation of PP2A activity and specificity is complex.
Translation of the catalytic subunit is tightly controlled
(13), and indeed, no changes in the total protein expression
or phosphorylation of PP2Ac in cells with or without c-KIT
was found (Fig. 1). However, inhibition of PP2A in the mutant c-KIT+ cells was associated with reduced expression of
the structural and several regulatory PP2A subunits (Fig. 1).
Downregulation of PP2A subunits has been reported in human gliomas, breast cancers, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia primary samples (15, 40, 41), and in melanoma
and lung cancer cell lines (29, 42). Furthermore, suppression
of PP2A-Aα or B56γ using short hairpin RNA induces tumorigenicity in transformed HEK293T cells (26, 29). That
overexpression of the PP2A-Aα subunit induces apoptosis
and inhibits the proliferation of FDC-P1 D816V c-KIT cells
(Fig. 2) suggests that functional loss of PP2A is required for

c-KIT–mediated tumorigenesis and further implicates PP2A
as a tumor suppressor.
We show that impaired PP2A activity can be restored in
mutant c-KIT + myeloid cells using the pharmacologic
agent, FTY720 (Fig. 3A). Importantly, treatment with
FTY720 induces c-KIT tyrosine dephosphorylation on both
imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant activating mutants
(Fig. 4A). The mechanisms underlying this are unclear. As
PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase, dephosphorylation
of c-KIT most likely involves the recruitment of additional
proteins that act directly on the receptor, such as the
c-KIT targeting tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (17, 43).
Furthermore, FTY720 specifically inhibited components of
the PI3K, MAPK, and Janus-activated kinase/STAT pathways in the D816V c-KIT cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, the cytotoxicity in these cells can be explained by the fact that FTY720

inhibits both the D816V c-KIT receptor and its downstream signals.
Consistent with the dephosphorylation of oncogenic
c-KIT and its downstream targets, reactivation of PP2A by
FTY720 reduced the proliferation (Table 1), induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B), and suppressed the clonogenic potential of cells
expressing V560G or D816V c-KIT (Fig. 3D). Importantly, at
the same concentration of FTY720, these effects were not
observed in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor–dependent EV cells or WT c-KIT cells grown in stem
cell factor. This highlights that the growth inhibition with
FTY720 treatment is dependent on the functional status of
PP2A, whereby cells expressing activating c-KIT mutations
are more sensitive due to impaired PP2A activity. The
increased sensitivity of c-KIT mutants compared with WT
c-KIT suggests that FTY720 could target malignant cells at
low doses without disrupting normal stem cell factor/c-KIT
signaling.
We show that daily administration of FTY720 markedly delays the in vivo growth of tumors expressing activating c-KIT
mutations through the induction of apoptosis at the cellular
level (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the reduction in tumor mass resulted in prolonged survival of FTY720-treated mice compared with saline-treated controls (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
FTY720 inhibited the engraftment of FDC-P1 D816V c-KIT
tumor cells into secondary lymphoid organs including the
spleen and bone marrow (Fig. 5D). FTY720 also inhibited
the proliferation of mutant c-KIT human cell lines and induced apoptosis of primary blasts from a CBF-AML patient
with a D816Y c-KIT mutation (Table 1). Taken together,
these results show that cancers harboring human c-KIT mutations are sensitive to FTY720 treatment.
FTY720 is a water-soluble, nontoxic drug with high oral
bioavailability that is currently being evaluated as an immunomodulator in phase III trials for multiple sclerosis patients
(35, 44). FTY720 becomes phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase 2 and FTY720-P binds to S1PR, which induces its
internalization (45). Although the mechanism of action is not
currently known, FTY720 has also been shown to activate purified PP2A in vitro (18), and its ability to activate PP2A and
induce cytotoxicity has been shown in a variety of leukemic
models (19, 46). In agreement with the mechanism whereby
FTY720 induces apoptosis of BCR/ABL+ myeloid and lymphoid progenitors (19), we have shown that PP2A reactivation does not require FTY720 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A).
Accordingly, incubation with FTY720-P has no effect on cell
viability or the clonogenic potential of mutant c-KIT+ cell lines
(Table 1; Fig. 3). Furthermore, the induction of apoptosis by
FTY720 specifically requires activation of PP2A, as inhibition

of FTY720-induced PP2A activation by okadaic acid restores
the clonogenic potential of mutant c-KIT+ cells (Fig. 3D). We
also show that a chemically distinct PP2A activator, forskolin,
inhibits the growth of c-KIT+ cells (Table 1). The hypersensitivity of oncogenic c-KIT+ cells to two distinct PP2A activators
strongly indicates that reactivation of PP2A is the essential
mechanism of action.
In summary, our data show for the first time that activating c-KIT mutations inhibit the tumor suppressor, PP2A, and
that reactivating PP2A effectively suppresses the in vitro and
in vivo growth of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant
c-KIT+ cells. As kinase domain mutations, such as D816V,
are most commonly detected in nonresponsive patients,
and there is currently no effective inhibitor against these mutants, PP2A reactivation represents a unique and powerful
strategy for treating drug-resistant patients. Furthermore,
our study together with those related to the interplay between PP2A and BCR/ABL (17) indicate that functional inactivation of PP2A tumor suppressor activity represents a
key step in the induction and maintenance of leukemias
and, perhaps, other solid tumors characterized by the aberrant activation of oncogenic tyrosine kinases.
Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
A provisional patent has been filed for the use of PP2A activators to treat
c-KIT cancers based on these data.
