suppressing FBXO11 and enhancing p53 activity

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating cancer cell proliferation, survival and sensitivity to
chemotherapy. The potential application of using miRNAs to predict therapeutic response to cancer treatment holds high promise,
but miRNAs with predictive value remain to be identiﬁed and underlying mechanisms have not been completely understood. Here,
we show a strong correlation between miR-621 expression and chemosensitivity to paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PTX/CBP) regimen,
an effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. High level of miR-621 predicts better response to PTX/CBP
regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, who also tend to achieve pathological complete response. Ectopic
overexpression of miR-621 promoted apoptosis and increased chemosensitivity to PTX and CBP both in cultured breast cancer cells
and in xenograft tumor model. We further show that FBXO11 is a direct functional target of miR-621 and miR-621 level is negatively
correlated with FBXO11 expression in breast cancer patients. Ectopic expression of FBXO11 attenuated increased apoptosis in
breast cancer cells overexpressing miR-621 upon PTX or CBP treatment. Consistently, high FBXO11 expression signiﬁcantly
correlated with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found in breast cancer cells FBXO11 interacts with p53
and promotes its neddylation, which suppressed the p53 transactivity. Accordingly, miR-621-dependent FBXO11 suppression
enhanced p53 activity and increased apoptosis in breast cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutics. Taken together, our data
suggest that miR-621 enhances chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to PTX/CBP chemotherapy by suppressing FBXO11depedent inhibition of p53. miR-621 may serve as a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer
treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. The
mortality of breast cancer has decreased over the last several
decades, likely because of a combination of mammographic
screening and improvements in systemic therapy.1 Neoadjuvant
systemic treatment before surgery for advanced breast cancer is
considered one of the most crucial factors in reducing
mortality.2–5 Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has
become the standard treatment of locally advanced breast cancer,
which can downstage the disease and improve the surgical
option.6 Moreover, NAC permits observation of tumor responsiveness to the treatment, and analyzing residual disease after NAC
may reveal novel therapeutic targets.7 To a speciﬁc NAC regimen,
generally only a fraction of patients achieve full response, while
others respond poorly and only suffer from side effects. Ideally,
those patients who would beneﬁt from a speciﬁc chemotherapy
regimen can be identiﬁed which will allow the remainder to be
spared from its side effects. Although clinical parameters such as
tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) or HER-2 receptor status,
histologic or nuclear grade, or the expression of single molecular
markers (Bcl-2, p53, MDR-1, Ki67 and so on) may have predictive
value to therapeutic response, these are not regimen-speciﬁc,

which limits their application in selecting NAC regimen.8,9 The
current development of predictive signatures to guide the use of
chemotherapy has not yet yielded clinically reliable tests.10–15
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, 20–22-nucleotide noncoding RNA
molecules that negatively regulate gene expression by binding to
the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of their target genes with partial
complementarity, leading to degradation of the target mRNAs,
inhibition of their translation or both.16,17 It has been found that
miRNAs regulate various pathological behaviors of cancer cells,
such as proliferation, motility and sensitivity to chemotherapy, by
targeting multiple genes simultaneously or in parallel.18–24
Our previous study has shown that weekly PTX/CBP (paclitaxel
plus carboplatin) regimen is effective nonanthracycline-containing
NAC for breast cancer, with a pCR (pathologic complete response)
rate of 19.4%.25 pCR indicates the disappearance of all invasive
cancer cells in the breast (and/or in axillary lymph nodes) after
neoadjuvant therapy, which is considered an early surrogate of
prolonged survival.26,27 However, the underlying mechanisms
dictating patient response to PTX/CBP regimen are poorly
understood. In this study, we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time, a
signiﬁcant correlation between miR-621 expression and chemosensitivity to PTX/CBP regimen in breast cancer patients. High

level of miR-621 predicts sensitivity to PTX/CBP NAC in breast
cancer patients who tend to achieve pCR. The increased
chemosensitivity could be mediated by miR-621-dependent
downregulation of FBXO11, resulting in enhanced p53 transactivity and increased apoptosis upon chemotherapy. Therefore,
miR-621 may be used as a predictive biomarker for PTX/CBP
regimen and a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer
treatment.

complete response and improves disease free survival

data.28 It was reported that CORNA algorism can be used to deﬁne
signiﬁcant microRNA-target correlation in DEGs, and to delineate
signiﬁcant associations between microRNAs and pathways with
GO terms.29 Therefore, we analyzed the 231 DEGs by CORNA to
identify signiﬁcant DEG-targeted miRNAs. Interestingly, predicted
miR-621-correlated genes were signiﬁcantly enriched in these 231
DEGs, indicating that miR-621 may be a target-associated miRNA
regulating breast cancer cell sensitivity to PTX/CBP regimen
chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S1).
To validate the association between miR-621 and response to
PTX/CBP regimen, an independent set of 50 patients (25 pCR
patients and 25 non-pCR patients) was further analyzed by using
quantitative RT-PCR. The clinicopathological features of this
validation set are listed in Table 1. Consistently, we found the
expression level of miR-621 was signiﬁcantly higher in tumors
from pCR patients than that in non-pCR patients (P = 0.015)
(Figure 1a), conﬁrming that the higher expression of miR-621 is
associated with a better response to PTX/CBP regimen chemotherapy. Furthermore, analyzing the disease free survival (DFS)
of these 50 breast cancer patients after stratiﬁcation by the level of
miR-621 revealed that patients with higher miR-621 expression
level have signiﬁcantly longer DFS (P = 0.04) (Figure 1b). Interestingly, the ER/progesterone receptor (PR) status also show
signiﬁcant inverse correlation with pCR, as patients with ER
negative (P = 0.02) or PR negative (P = 0.03) tend to achieve pCR
(Table 1). Nevertheless, multiple regression analysis showed that
only the miR-621 level could be an independent predict factor for
pCR (hazards ratio = 0.142, 95% conﬁdence interval = 0.034–0.594;
P = 0.007) (Table 2). To evaluate this predictive value, we used the
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to analyze the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of miR-621. The area under the curve
(AUC) was 0.859 (conﬁdence interval = 0.752–0.965; P o 0.0001),
which indicated high accuracy of predictive value. The sensitivity
and speciﬁcity were 91.3 and 63.6%, respectively (Figure 1c). These
ﬁndings suggest that increased miR-621 expression may be
responsible for high sensitivity to PTX/CBP chemotherapy and
predict pCR in breast cancer patients.

MiR-621 enhances chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and carboplatin
by promoting apoptosis in breast cancer cells
To validate the correlation between miR-621 and chemosensitivity, we examined the miR-621 expression level and IC50 (inhibitory
concentration to produce 50% cell death) value of PTX or CBP in
several breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7 cells appeared to be less

MDA-MB-231HM cells (IC50 of PTX: 23.52, 15.43, 15.63 μg/ml,
respectively, P = 0.002) (IC50 of CBP: 0.69, 0.29, 0.32 mg/ml,
respectively, P = 0.001) (Figures 2a and b). In parallel, the
endogenous expression level of miR-621 in MCF-7 cells was
signiﬁcantly lower than that in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231HM
cells (P = 0.001) (Figure 2c), suggesting a positive correlation
between miR-621 expression level and sensitivity to PTX or CBP in
breast cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-621
(Supplementary Figure S1a) signiﬁcantly increased chemosensitivity to PTX and CBP in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231HM cells
(Figures 2d and e). Consistently, modulating miR-621 level in
MCF-7 cells by transfecting pre-miR-621 or miR-621-sponge
inhibitor (Supplementary Figure S1b) decreased or an enhanced
cell survival in response to PTX plus CBP treatment, respectively
(Figure 2f). These results collectively support that increasing
expression of miR-621 might enhance drug sensitivity to PTX and
CBP in breast cancer cells.

We next asked how miR-621 regulates drug sensitivity. Overexpression of miR-621 in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells markedly
increased the cleavage of Caspase 8 and PARP1 in response to PTX
and CBP treatment, suggesting an enhanced apoptosis upon drug
treatment (Figures 3a and b). The tumor suppressor p53 activates
a transcriptional program that directs cells to undergo apoptosis
or senescence in response to cellular stress.30–32 Interestingly, we
found that the expression of p53 target genes, such as TNFRSF10B
(DR5) and BBC3 (PUMA), were increased in response to PTX or CBP
treatment, which was further enhanced by miR-621 overexpression (Figures 3a and b; Supplementary Figures S1c and d). In
accordance, transfection of miR-621 sponge inhibitor suppressed
the upregulation of PUMA and cleaved-PARP1 by PTX or CBP
treatment (Supplementary Figures S1e and f). Moreover, increased
mRNA levels of TNFRSF10B(DR5) and BBC3(PUMA) genes upon
cytotoxic treatment were further augmented by overexpressing
miR-621 (Figures 3c and d).
To further examine whether miR-621 can enhance p53
transactivity, we transfected pre-miR-621 into HCT116 WT and
HCT116 p53− / − cells, and treated these cells with PTX or CBP.
Expression of CDKN1A (p21) and TNFRSF10B (DR5) were signiﬁcantly activated in HCT116 WT cells, but not in p53− / − cells, upon
CBP or PTX treatment, and the effect was further enhanced by
overexpressing miR-621. These ﬁndings support that p53 is
essential for miR-621 to enhance p21/DR5 induction by CBP/PTX
(Figures 3e–g). Consistently, we found the upregulation of p53target genes p21, PUMA and DR5 was detected at both mRNA
(Supplementary Figure S2) and protein levels (Figure 3h) in ZR-751 cells exposed to PTX or CBP treatment, which was absent in p53depleted ZR-75-1 cells. Moreover, we found ectopic miR-621
further augmented induction of p53-target genes upon CBP or

PTX treatment in wild-type ZR-75-1 cells. Altogether, our data
suggest that miR-621 may regulate breast cancer cell chemosensitivity by enhancing p53 transactivity and thereby promoting
apoptosis.

FBXO11 is a direct target of miR-621 in breast cancer cells
To elucidate the underlying mechanisms promoting chemosensitivity in human breast cancer cells by miR-621, we used several
bioinformatics programs to identify potential target genes of

miR-621. Among the target genes predicted by the miRanda,
TargetScan and starBase, FBXO11 was indicated to be a potential
target gene of miR-621, which was also found as a downregulated
DEG in pCR patients in the training set (Supplementary Table S1).
Accordingly, FBXO11 was also identiﬁed as a miR-621-associated
DEG by CORNA analysis. Moreover, ectopic miR-621 substantially
reduced FBXO11 level in HEK293T, MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells
(Figures 4a and b; Figures 3a and b). Since Dicer is a central
regulator of miRNA-mediated gene silencing by loading miRNA:
mRNA into RISC complex, deletion of Dicer signiﬁcantly represses
miRNA-dependent gene repression.33 We found that overexpression of miR-621 could signiﬁcantly decrease the expression of
FBXO11 in HCT116 WT cells, but not in HCT116 DICER− / − cells
(Figures 4c and d), suggesting that the repression of FBXO11 by
miR-621 is Dicer-dependent. In accordance, miR-621 overexpression signiﬁcantly repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter
fused to FBXO11 3’-UTR, but not the one fused to FBXO11 3’-UTR
mutant in which miR-621-recognition site was deleted (Figure 4e).
All these data strongly support that miR-621 may repress FBXO11
expression through recognition of its binding site within FBXO11
3’-UTR in human cancer cells.
To conﬁrm the negative correlation between the decreased
FBXO11 and enhanced response to PTX/CBP regimen shown in
our training set (Supplementary Table S1), we further analyzed
expression of FBXO11 by quantitative PCR in patient samples from
the validation set. We found that the expression of FBXO11 in pCR
patient tumors was signiﬁcantly lower than that in non-pCR
patients (P = 0.016, Figure 4f). Moreover, expression of FBXO11
presented a negative correlation with miR-621 level in these 50
patients (r = -0.355, P = 0.021) (Figure 4g). Additionally, we found
high FBXO11 level was associated with poor DFS in these 50
patients, although the correlation did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance likely because of small sample size (Supplementary
Figure S3a). In support of this observation, we found lower
FBXO11 expression also is signiﬁcantly associated with better DFS
in breast cancer patients received NAC in a recently published
study (GSE25055, Figure 4h).34 Moreover, high FBXO11 level was
found to correlate to shorter RFS (Figure 4i) and DMFS
(Supplementary Figure S3b) in breast cancer patients. Collectively,
these data indicate that the chemo-sensitizing effect of miR-621 in
breast cancer may depend on FBXO11 downregulation.
TP53 transcriptional activity is involved in miR-621/FBXO11 axis to
regulate chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells
The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human
cancers, and functional loss of TP53 gene is correlated with
chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis in breast cancer as
well as several other cancer types.30 FBXO11 is a member of the
F-box protein family which form SKP1-cullin-F-box ubiquitin ligase
complex and promote protein ubiquitylation and proteasomedependent degradation.35,36 Although FBXO11 appeared not to
directly promote p53 degradation, it was reported that FBXO11
could increase p53 neddylation, which abrogates p53 acetylation
at Lys320 and leads to suppression of p53 transactivity.37 FBXO11
has two splicing isoforms (FBXO11-1 and -4), both of which can be
inhibited by a siRNA duplex against FBXO11.35 We cloned FBXO11
isoform 1 (NP_079409.3) into pCMV backbone and transiently
transfected into cells. Consistent with the previous study,37 we
found that the p53-dependent transactivity was signiﬁcantly
reduced in cells overexpressing FBXO11, whereas deletion of
F-box domain in FBXO11 (FBXO11 ΔN) abolished its suppressive
effects (Figures 5a and b). Co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed
that endogenous FBXO11 could interact with p53 in MCF-7 cells
upon CBP or PTX treatment (Supplementary Figures S3c and d).
Moreover, overexpression of FBXO11 substantially promoted p53
neddylation in MCF7 cells (Figure 5c), which correlated with
decreased p53 transcriptional activity (Figure 5e). Accordingly, we
Oncogene (2016) 448 – 458

found CBP treatment enhanced p53 neddylation in breast cancer
cells, while overexpressing miR-621 suppressed both basal and
drug-induced p53 neddylation, likely due to a decreased FBXO11
expression by miR-621 (Figure 5d). Interestingly, ectopic expression of FBXO11 also attenuated miR-621-depedent increase of p53
transactivation, suggesting a critical role of FBXO11 repression in
enhancing p53 activity by miR-621 (Figure 5e). These results
suggest that enhanced p53 transactivity by down-regulating
FBXO11 may account for miR-621-depedent chemo-sensitizing
effect in breast cancer cells.
In line with these observation, overexpressing FBXO11 substantially reduced PTX or CBP-induced p21, DR5 or PUMA
upregulation in MCF-7 cells without affecting p53 level, supporting a negative role of FBXO11 in regulating p53 transactivity
(Figure 5f). Moreover, ectopic miR-621 increased the induction of
DR5 and p21 as well as cleavage of Caspase 8 and PARP1 in MCF-7
cells upon PTX or CBP treatment, which was attenuated by cotransfecting FBXO11 (Figure 5g). Although the FBXO11-4
appeared to be the major isoform subjected to suppression by
miR-621 in MCF-7 cells, reconstitution of FBXO11-1 was sufﬁcient
for functionally compensating the FBXO11 suppression in MCF-7
cells (Figures 5f and g), which is consistent with a previously
report.35 Taken together, these results indicate that miR-621 may
regulate chemosensitivity by down-regulating target gene
FBXO11, resulting in enhanced p53 transactivity and apoptosis
in breast cancer cells in response to PTX or CBP treatment.
MiR-621 upregulation enhances breast cancer chemosensitivity to
paclitaxel and carboplatin in vivo
To validate the role of miR-621 in enhancing chemosensitivity of
breast cancer to PTX/CBP treatment, we generated MCF-7 cells
stably overexpressing miR-621 or control vector, and orthotopically injected these cells into the mammary gland fat pads of
BALB/c nude mice. After 20 days, these mice were treated with
PBS (Sham) or PTX (15mg/kg) plus CBP (5 mg/kg) every 4 days for
six cycles. We found that miR-621 overexpression signiﬁcantly
delayed MCF-7 xenograft tumors growth. Moreover, the tumor
volume of miR-621-overexpressing xenografts decreased to a
greater extent than that of control xenografts, in response to PTX/
CBP treatment, indicating a chemo-sensitizing effect of miR-621
(P = 0.016; Figures 6a and b). Furthermore, consistent with in vitro
analyses, miR-621-overexpressed tumors showed decreased
expression of FBXO11, while no noticeable change of p53
expression was observed regardless of miR-621 level (Figures 6c
and d). In accordance, we detected higher expression levels of
DR5 and PUMA as well as increased Caspase 8 activation in
miR-621-stable xenografts than that in control tumors upon PTX/
CBP treatment, suggesting an enhanced apoptotic response
(Figure 6e). All these observations from immunohistochemical
staining were conﬁrmed by western blot using xenograft tumor
lysates (Figure 6f). Altogether, these data strongly support that
miR-621 promotes chemosensitivity to PTX/CBP regimen in breast
cancers, which is likely mediated by repressing FBXO11 and
enhancing p53-regulated apoptosis upon chemotherapy
(Figure 6g).
DISCUSSION
Increasing efforts to identify patients that are sensitive or resistant
to regimen-speciﬁc treatment have highlighted the need for
applicable biomarkers to predict response to speciﬁc drug, so as
to achieve effective personalized treatment while sparing patients
from side effects. In this study, we showed for the ﬁrst time that
miR-621 expression level might be useful for predicting response
to PTX/CBP NAC in breast cancer patients. High miR-621
expression in breast cancer tissues strongly associated with
increased sensitivity to PTX/CBP regimen and high probability to

achieve pCR, which is corroborated by the signiﬁcant association
between high miR-621 and better DFS (Figures 1a and b).
It is well established that miRNAs can function as tumor
suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cellular context and
cancer types.18–21 In breast cancer, aberrant miRNA expression has
been implicated to affect the response to various treatments,
including chemotherapy, anti-endocrine therapies, targeted
therapies, and radiotherapy.38 MiR-621 is located in chromosome
13q, which also hosts tumor suppressor miR-16-1/-15a cluster. A
previous study speculated that the loss of miR-621, miR-16-1 and
miR-15a because of 13q deletion might induce the upregulation
of critical cell cycle control genes, resulting in uncontrolled
proliferation in dedifferentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.39 Data
obtained from the TCGA invasive breast cancer dataset show that
miR-621 is mostly deleted in a small number of patients who
harbor miR-621 gene alteration (Supplementary Figure S4a),
indicating that miR-621 likely acts as tumor suppressor in breast
cancers. Here, we showed that miR-621 directly targeted FBXO11
3’-UTR and repressed its expression (Figure 4), which led to
increased transcriptional activity of tumor suppressor p53 and
breast cancer cell apoptosis upon PTX and CBP treatment both
in vitro and in vivo (Figures 3, 5 and 6). These ﬁndings were further
supported by clinical data indicating that breast cancer patients
with low FBXO11 expression tend to achieve better DFS and OS
(Figures 4h and i). Therefore, our study revealed a novel
mechanism that may be involved in the chemo-sensitizing and
tumor-suppressive effects of miR-621. It appeared miR-621
expressed in different breast cancer patients at a varying level,
which may inﬂuence the sensitivity to the NAC regimen. Our
in vitro overexpression studies likely mimicked the cell response to
chemotherapeutics in those cancer cells with very high miR-621
level, which renders them sensitive to chemotherapy. The
percentage of this high miR-621 population in the tumor mass
likely dictated the overall response to NAC. As the pathophysiological functions and molecular mechanisms of a particular miRNA
are highly dependent on cancer cell type, it is plausible additional
molecular targets and the affected signaling cascades may be
involved in mediating miR-621’s chemo-sensitizing effect. For
instance, TP53 is mutated and loses it pro-apoptotic function in
certain breast cancer cells. Nonetheless, we found upregulating
miR-621 also increased the chemosensistivity in MDA-MB-231HM
cells that harbor p53 mutation (Figures 2d and e). These data
suggested that miR-621 may also sensitizing breast cancer cells to
PTX/CBP regimen via additional p53-independent mechanism,
which warrants further investigation.
FBXO11 is a member of the F-box protein family and a
component of the SKP1-cullin-F-box ubiquitin E3 ligase complex.
F-box proteins recruit substrates to SKP1-cullin-F-box ligase
complexes, thereby promoting their ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation.35,36 FBXO11 mutation can
be found in ~ 20% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients,
which correlates with increased levels of oncoprotein BCL6 and
implies a tumor-suppressive role of FBXO11.40 Oncogenic miR-21dependent suppression of FBXO11 was found to promote tumor
progression in melanoma, glioblastoma and prostate cancer cells
which may also mediated by increased BCL6 expression.41 A
recent study also showed that FBXO11 promoted degradation of
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator SNAIL, indicating that FBXO11 may inhibit cancer metastasis by blocking EMT.42
However, genomic sequencing and expression array data from the
TCGA dataset indicate that FBXO11 is predominantly ampliﬁed
and/or upregulated in breast cancer patients who harbor FBXO11
gene alteration (Supplementary Figure S4b), suggesting that
FBXO11 may be oncogenic in breast cancers. In addition, it
was shown that FBXO11 could stabilize Set8 by downregulation
of Cdt2 thereby restraining CRL4Cdt2 activity, resulting in increased
breast cancer cell metastasis and potentially reduced
apoptosis.35,43,44 We identiﬁed FBXO11 as a direct target of
Oncogene (2016) 448 – 458

miR-621, which may mediate miR-621-dependent chemosensitivity to PTX/CBP regimen. Furthermore, we found that FBXO11
levels in primary tumors of breast cancer patients were inversely
correlated with miR-621 expression, and the high expression of
FBXO11 was associated with poor prognosis (Figure 4), further
supporting an oncogenic function of FBXO11 in breast cancer. It is
plausible that FBXO11 plays distinct roles in different cancer types
and even in different stages of cancer development. In breast
cancer, FBXO11 may promote primary tumor growth and suppress
apoptosis in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy by inhibiting
p53 activity in those cancer cells harboring functional p53,
whereas it could repress metastasis via degrading SNAIL in p53mutated cancer cells at late stages of breast cancer.
Consistent with a previous report, our data support that FBXO11
could suppress p53 transactivity and reduce breast cancer
apoptosis upon chemotherapy (Figure 5). Besides, FBXO11 may
also antagonize p53 by indirectly destabilizing p53 protein via
Set8-depedent Numb acetylation, thereby promoting breast
cancer progression.37,44 Accordingly, we found CDK inhibitor p21
expression, as a primary gene target of p53, was decreased in
breast cancer cells overexpressing FBXO11 but increased in
miR-621-transfected cells upon CBP or PTX treatment (Figures 5f
and g). However, FBXO11-mediated Cdt2 degradation was shown
to stabilize p21, leading in increased p21 level.35 Therefore, it is
likely that decreased p21 transcription due to FBXO11-dependent
p53 inhibition overweighed the p21 protein stabilization due to
FBXO11-mediated Cdt2 degradation in breast cancer cells
exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs. Nevertheless, it is also
possible there was additional miR-621-mediated mechanism
promoting p21 upregulation which remains to be elucidated.
Although TP53 gene is frequently mutated in a variety of
tumors, such as in ovarian (50%), colorectal (43%) and lung
cancers (36%), only ~ 23% of breast cancer tumors harbor TP53
mutation, suggesting additional mechanisms for silencing p53 in
breast cancer cells.45 The wild-type p53 tumor suppressor alters
gene expression in response to diverse cellular stresses, including
genotoxic drug treatment, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
senescence and DNA repair. Beside of inactivation of p53 by
proteasome-dependent degradation, p53 neddylation was shown
to inhibit its transactivity.37,46 These ﬁndings are in agreement
with a recent report showing that the over-activated neddylation
pathway is a critical player promoting lung cancer development.47
Therefore, varying mechanisms developed in breast cancer cells to
suppress wild-type p53 function may contribute substantially to
therapeutic resistance to cytotoxic treatments which induce
cancer cell apoptosis. FBXO11-dependent silencing of p53
transactivity may disrupt the apoptotic machinery, resulting in
resistance to various anti-cancer drugs. Our results indicated that
the miR-621-mediated suppression of FBXO11 could enhance the
p53 transcriptional pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer cell
apoptosis, especially in those harboring functional p53, in
response to PTX and CBP treatment (Figures 3, 5 and 6). These
ﬁndings suggest that upregulating miR-621 may be a promising
chemo-sensitizing strategy, which may help to achieve better pCR
rate in NAC as well as improve prognosis for systemic therapy in
breast cancer patients.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that elevated miR-621
expression levels may have important roles in enhancing
sensitivity to PTX/CBP regimen chemotherapy in breast cancer
patients. In addition, we show that miR-621 mediated-PTX and
CBP sensitivity is, at least in part, mediated by downregulation of
FBXO11 and subsequent increase of p53 transactivity. A single
miRNA may regulates multiple genes within a signaling network
or parallel networks which could work synergistically to modulate
cellular processes. Although our present results established a link
between miR-621 and FBXO11, it is plausible that additional
targets of miR-621 may also contribute to miR-621’s function in
promoting chemotherapy sensitivity. The efﬁcacy of miR-621 in

sensitizing breast cancer to chemotherapy may also support its
application as potential chemo-sensitizing agents. Our studies
may provide rationale for using miR-621 as predictive biomarker
to stratify patients before receiving PTX/CBP NAC, and developing
miR-621-based therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection, evaluation of treatment response, sample
collection and RNA extraction
A series of clinical data from 50 breast cancer patients was collected
(Table 1). The design of this phase II neoadjuvant treatment study has been
previously described.25 The protocol was reviewed and approved by an
independent ethical committee/institutional review board, and all patients
gave their written informed consent before inclusion in this study. All
eligible patients received four cycles of weekly PTX/CBP regimen.25
Patients proceeded to surgery within 4 weeks of the last dose of
chemotherapy. pCR was deﬁned as the absence of invasive tumor cells in
the ﬁnal surgical breast and axillary lymph node samples. Residual ductal
carcinoma in situ was included in the pCR category. Tumor tissue was
obtained by a core biopsy prior to treatment and immediately stored at
− 80 °C. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell lines, plasmids and transfection
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1, HT1080 and HEK293T cell lines were
obtained from ATCC. The high pulmonary metastatic MDA-MB-231HM
cell line, derived from MDA-MB-231, was established by our institute and
reported previously.48,49 HCT 116, HCT 116 Dicer− / − and HCT 116 p53− / −
cells were obtained as a generous gift from Dr Bert Vogelstein (Johns
Hopkins University). All these cells were cultured under standard
conditions.
Control (26164) sponge construct obtained from Addgene and the
strategy to generate miR-621 sponge has been described in a previous
report.50 FBXO11 expression constructs were subcloned from ImageClone
BC130445 (Thermo, Rockford, IL, USA) into pCMV backbone. FBXO11ΔN
construct was generated by deleting FBXO11 N-terminal 1–127 amino
acids (containing F-box). FBXO11 3-UTR was cloned from HeLa genomic
DNA (NEB) and inserted into pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase Vector (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) for generating FBXO11 3-UTR luciferase reporter
constructs. FBXO11 3-UTR miR-621 site mutant luciferase reporter was
generated by Quick change site-direct mutagenesis. All plasmids were
transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Stable expression of miR-621 with lentivirus vector
Human miR-621 gene was PCR ampliﬁed from normal genomic DNA and
cloned into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-Puro vector for ectopic expression of
miR-621. MCF-7 cells were infected with vector control or miR-621overexpression virus and selected by Puromycin. The expression levels of
miR-621 between MCF-7/miR-621 and MCF-7/vector were conﬁrmed by
quantitative real-time PCR (fold change 10.39) (Supplementary Figure S5b).

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in 10% PBS and
90% Lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA,
0.5% NP-40, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 20 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mM
p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mM sodium ﬂuoride). In all, 1 μg of indicated
antibody or IgG control was added into lysates and incubated with protein
G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Sepharose-enriched immunocomplexes
were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF)
membrane and analyzed with immunoblotting.
To detect neddylated form of p53, cells were lyzed with 1% SDS in
immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 30 min, then
diluted to 0.1% SDS with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 antibody. The transferred PVDF membrane was probed
with antibody against NEDD8.

Animal study
All animal work was done in accordance with a protocol approved be the

Cancer Center. MCF-7/miR-621; MCF-7/vector (1x107) cells were injected
into the mammary fat pads of BALB/c nude mice. All mice were
supplemented with estrogen pellets. 20 days after tumor cell transplantation, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with PTX (15 mg/kg; Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA) plus CBP (5 mg/kg; Sigma). The treatments were
administered every 4 days for six cycles. Tumor sizes were measured with
caliper and calculated by the formula V = (W)2xL/2. At end point, the mice
were killed and the mammary tumors were harvested for quantitative realtime PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry staining.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was done by one-way ANOVA, and comparisons among
groups were done by the independent sample two-sided Student t-test.
Patient DFS analysis was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Fisher’s
exact test was used to analyze categorical variables. The Spearman rank
test was used to identify the correlation between miR-621 and FBXO11.
Multiple regression analysis was used to determine independent predict
factors for achieving pCR. ROC curve was used to analyze the predictive
value of miR-621. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0
software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). P-valueo 0.05 was considered as
statistically signiﬁcant.
