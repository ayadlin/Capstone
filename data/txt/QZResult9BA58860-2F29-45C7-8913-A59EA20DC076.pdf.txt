Abstract
Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAID) exhibit antineoplastic properties, but conventional NSAIDs do
not fully meet safety and efﬁcacy criteria for use as anticancer agents. In this study, we evaluated the
chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy of 5 novel phospho-NSAIDs, each of which includes in addition to the NSAID moiety
a diethylphosphate linked through a butane moiety. All 5 compounds inhibited the growth of human breast,
colon, and pancreatic cancer cell lines with micromolar potency. In vivo investigations conﬁrmed the antitumor
activity of phospho-aspirin (PA) and phospho-sulindac (PS) in inhibiting tumor growth in established human
xenograft models, in which cell proliferation was suppressed and apoptosis enhanced in the absence of detectable animal toxicity. Notably, all of the phospho-NSAIDs tested induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in
cultured cells, with PA and PS inducing detectable levels of oxidative stress in vivo that were associated positively
with apoptosis and negatively with proliferation. Potentially explaining these effects, all of the phospho-NSAIDs
tested also inhibited the thioredoxin system and the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-kB. Taken together,
our ﬁndings show the strong anticancer efﬁcacy and promising safety of phospho-NSAIDs in preclinical
models of breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer, suggesting further evaluation as anticancer agents. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAID) are the most
widely used anti-inﬂammatory compounds, with aspirin, the
prototypical NSAID, being one of the oldest and still most
extensively used medications in the world (1, 2). NSAIDs have a
signiﬁcant antineoplastic effect, which is currently viewed in
the context of the recently appreciated role of inﬂammation in
cancer (3). Interventional studies have established aspirin and
sulindac as chemopreventive agents against colon cancer (4, 5).
For the remaining NSAIDs, the evidence of their chemopreventive properties, strong as it is, is mainly based on epidemiologic
studies (4, 6, 7). For example, a meta-analysis of 91 epidemiologic studies showed a signiﬁcant exponential decline
with increasing intake of NSAIDs in the risk for 7 to 10
malignancies including the 4 major types: colon, breast, lung,
and prostate cancer (8, 9). However, there is no chemotherapeutic application for aspirin or other NSAIDs in humans

or animals. Only sulindac when combined with other anticancer agents is reported to have a chemotherapeutic effect
in mice (10).
NSAIDs prevent cancer likely through pleiotropic effects
(reviewed in refs. 11–13). Although their best recognized
molecular target is the enzyme COX, there is considerable
evidence that such an effect may not be required for their
anticancer actions (14, 15). Regardless of mechanistic issues, it
is clear that conventional NSAIDs do not meet the criteria of
safety and efﬁcacy for their application as anticancer agents.
NSAIDs are associated with considerable side effects, and their
chemoprevention efﬁcacy is rather limited, at best not exceeding 50% (16). Thus, there is a need to develop compounds with
improved efﬁcacy and safety.
Prompted by these considerations, we synthesized a series of
compounds based on 4 representative NSAIDs: aspirin, sulindac (2 derivatives, differing in the structure of the sulindac
moiety), ibuprofen, and ﬂurbiprofen (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Each one of these NSAIDs is chemopreventive against at least
one major type of cancer based either on preclinical or
epidemiologic data (7, 8, 17, 18). Structurally, these 5 compounds belong to a broader class of novel compounds that we
have synthesized, which conform to the general chemical
formula A-aliphatic linker-DEP, where A can be any compound, the linker can vary in size and/or structure as long as
it is aliphatic, and DEP ¼ diethylphosphate. Here, we report on
compounds where A ¼ NSAID moiety and the linker is a moiety
derived from 1,4-butane diol. Of note, the enhanced safety of
the phospho-NSAIDs is attributed in part to this chemical
modiﬁcation, because the carboxylic group, present in nearly

all NSAIDs, mediates much of their gastrointestinal toxicity
(19).
Phospho-sulindac (PS; OXT-328), phospho-aspirin (PA;
MDC-118), and phospho-ibuprofen (PI; MDC-917) are highly
effective against inﬂammation, as shown in a rat arthritis
model (20). All 3 had a favorable safety proﬁle, especially with
regard to gastrointestinal toxicity (20, 21). Recently, PS was
found in preclinical models of colon cancer to be strongly
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic. For example, in combination with diﬂuoromethylornithine, PS prevented 91% of
intestinal tumors in Min mice (21) and PS alone inhibited the
growth of human colon xenografts in nude mice by 70% (22).
In this study, we evaluated the chemotherapeutic potential
of these 5 compounds against breast, colon, and pancreatic
cancer using human cancer xenografts. All displayed a significant anticancer effect, which was mediated, at least to some
extent, by a redox effect that likely affected major downstream
signaling pathways.

escine diacetate (DCFDA; Invitrogen), incubated at 37 C for 30
minutes in the dark, and their ﬂuorescence intensity was
determined by ﬂow cytometry (Beckman Coulter Inc.). We
analyzed a minimum of 10,000 events with the WinMDI software
and expressed the data as the ﬂuorescent intensity versus events.
Determination of thioredoxin reductase activity
After treatment, cells were lysed and thioredoxin reductase
(TrxR) activity was determined in the protein lysate by a
commercially available kit, following the instructions of the
manufacturer (Cayman Chemical). In this assay, TrxR uses
NADPH to reduce 5,50 -dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to 5thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid.
Protein extraction from whole-cell lysates
After treatment, cells were scraped on ice, washed with icecold PBS, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by the
Bradford method (Bio-Rad).

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Phospho-NSAIDs, synthesized following the methodology of
Penning and colleagues (23), were provided by Medicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The lipids for the preparation of liposomes
were from Avanti Phospholipids. For each compound, we
prepared a 100-mmol/L stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). In all cell culture media, the ﬁnal DMSO concentration was adjusted to 1%. All general solvents and reagents were
of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade or
of the highest grade commercially available.
Cell culture
Human breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), colon (HT-29 and
SW480), and pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3) cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
and were grown in the speciﬁc medium and conditions suggested by ATCC. All the cell lines were passaged in our
laboratory for less than 6 months after receipt.

Liposome–PI
PI was loaded onto polyethylene glycolylated liposomes,
following standard protocols (25, 26). Brieﬂy, 50 mg of phosphatidylcholine, 19 mg of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000], and
40 mg of PI were dissolved in chloroform. The free drug was
removed by dialyzing the liposomal solution against PBS, and
PI concentration was determined by HPLC.

Cell kinetics analysis
5-Bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into newly
synthesized cellular DNA was used to determine cell proliferation as described (24). For apoptosis, 1.0  105 cells per well
were treated with phospho-NSAIDs for 24 hours, trypsinized,
stained with Annexin V–ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (100
dilution; Invitrogen) and propidium iodide (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma),
and analyzed by FACScaliber (BD Bioscience). Cell-cycle progression was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry as described (24).

Efﬁcacy in nude mouse breast, colon, and pancreatic
xenografts
Female Balb/c nude mice (Charles River Laboratories)
were inoculated s.c. into each of their ﬂanks with 2.5  106
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) or 1.5  106 HT-29 colon cancer cells or 2  106 BxPC-3
human pancreatic cancer cells in PBS (ﬁnal volume 100 mL).
Once the tumor reached approximately 100 to 150 mm3, animals
were randomized into the control group, which received corn
oil, and the treatment groups, which received PA 110 mg/kg
or PS 160 mg/kg in corn oil or PI or liposome–PI (Lipo-PI)
300 mg/kg (n ¼ 10 per group). The treatment was administered
once daily for 5 days a week by oral gavage for PA and PS or
intraperitoneally for PI and Lipo-PI. Tumor volume was calculated as [length  width  (length þ width/2)  0.56]. Tumor
growth inhibition was calculated by dividing the percentage of
increase from baseline of the tumor volume of the treated group
over the corresponding percentage of volume increase of the
control group. At the end of treatment, animals were sacriﬁced
and tumors were removed and weighed.

Determination of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
After treatment, cells were collected by trypsinization, resuspended in 10 mmol/L of 5-(and-6)-carboxy-20 ,70 -dichloroﬂuor-

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, TrxR, and phospho–NF-kB (activated form of NF-kB) was carried out on

Cell viability assay
Following treatment with various concentrations of phosphoNSAIDs for 24 hours, the reduction of MTT dye was determined
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Nuclear fractions were isolated from 2  106 cells (treated
and controls) and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) as previously described (24).

Novel Phospho-NSAIDs As Anticancer Agents

(110 mg/kg) and PS (160 mg/kg) were both given orally daily,
5 days a week, starting when the tumor volume reached
approximately 100 mm3 and were continued to day 37 when
mice were euthanized. Compared with controls, both drugs
inhibited tumor growth to a statistically signiﬁcant extent
between day 12 and the end of the study. On day 37, the
tumor volume of each study group was as follows: control ¼
250  48 mm3 (mean  SEM for this and all subsequent
values), PA ¼ 119  50 mm3, and PS ¼ 87  32 mm3, representing growth inhibition of 87.3% (tumor stasis) by PA and
108.6% (tumor regression) by PS (P < 0.01–0.05 for both). For
HT-29 human colon cancer xenografts, PS 160 mg/kg was
given orally daily, 5 days a week, starting when the tumor
volume was approximately 150 mm3. Tumor growth inhibition became statistically signiﬁcant staring on treatment day
9. After 17 days of treatment, the tumor volume of the control
group was 1,020  130 mm3, and that of the PS-treated group
was 554  96 mm3 (mean  SEM for both groups), representing a 54.0% tumor growth inhibition by PS (P < 0.05). For
BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer xenografts, PI 300 mg/kg,
plain or incorporated in Lipo-PI, was given intraperitoneally
daily, 5 days a week for 20 days, starting when the tumor
volume was approximately 100 mm3. At sacriﬁce, the tumor
volume of each study group was as follows: control ¼ 246 
40 mm3 (mean  SEM for this and all subsequent values), PI
¼ 157  20 mm3, and Lipo-PI ¼ 90  23 mm3. After 20 days of
treatment, PI reduced tumor growth by 57% (not statistically
signiﬁcant), whereas Lipo-PI completely prevented tumor
growth (100% inhibition, P < 0.01–0.05), maintaining tumor
stasis throughout the treatment period. Underscoring the
signiﬁcance of the drug delivery method, the mouse plasma
level of PI was 3.5-fold higher in Lipo-PI than in PI (data not
shown). Of note, the liposomal formulation of PI had a
minimal effect on its in vitro IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Consistent with our previous ﬁndings (20, 21), none of
the animals showed any signs of toxicity from the phosphoNSAIDs, including weight loss or distress. In addition,
on autopsy at sacriﬁce there were no signs of gastrointestinal
bleeding or gastrointestinal, pancreatic, renal, or liver damage.

human breast, colon, and pancreatic xenograft tissue samples
as previously described (27). Apoptosis was determined by the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay (28). The positive control was
treatment of samples with DNAse I. At least 10 ﬁelds per
sample (at magniﬁcation 200) were scored independently by
investigators blinded to their identity. Cells with a blue nucleus
(or blue cytoplasm in the case of TrxR) were considered
unlabelled, whereas those with a brown nucleus (or brown
cytoplasma in the case of TrxR) were considered labeled. We
calculated the percentage of proliferating and apoptotic cells
by dividing the number of labeled cells by the number of cells in
each ﬁeld and multiplying by 100.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as mean  SEM. Differences
between groups were determined by 1-factor ANOVA followed by the Tukey test for multiple comparisons and the
association between data sets by correlation analysis and
computing the correlation coefﬁcient (R). P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Phospho-NSAIDs inhibit the growth of human breast,
colon, and pancreatic cancer in vitro and in xenografts
Initially, we evaluated the growth inhibitory effect of the 5
phospho-NSAIDs in 6 human cancer cell lines, 2 each from
breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers. The members of each
pair differ signiﬁcantly from each other. Table 1 shows key
genotypic features of each cell line and the 24-hour IC50 of these
compounds, which range from 17 to 303 mmol/L. It seems that
the growth inhibition potency of these compounds was independent of the tissue of origin, receptor status, or COX expression of these cell lines.
We then determined the effect of PA, PS, and PI on the
growth of breast, colon, and pancreatic human cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice (Fig. 1). Our results are as follows: In MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts, PA

The cytokinetic effect of phospho-NSAIDs in vitro and in
vivo
To understand the mechanism by which these compounds
inhibited cell and tumor growth, we evaluated their effect on
cell kinetics in both cancer cells and xenografts.
Inhibition of cell proliferation. At their IC50, the 5 phospho-NSAIDs inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells by 37% to 87% compared with controls, with PS
being the most and PA the least potent. Similar results were
obtained in BxPC-3 human pancreatic cells. The phosphoNSAIDs also inhibited cell proliferation in xenografts from

these cell lines by 29% to 59%, except for plain PI, for which the
effect (13% reduction) was not statistically signiﬁcant and
contrasted with that of Lipo-PI. These results are shown
in Table 2, Fig. 2A, and Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S3.
Induction of apoptosis. We distinguished 2 stages of
apoptosis, discernible by ﬂow cytometry, namely "early apoptosis," in which the cells are viable (they exclude propidium
iodide) and "late apoptosis," known also as secondary necrosis,
in which the cells cannot exclude propidium iodide. The main
ﬁndings in MDA-MB-231 cells are as follows: (i) late apoptosis
predominates; (ii) PI had the strongest and PA the weakest
proapoptotic effect; and (iii) despite their minimal structural
differences, phospho-desoxy-sulindac (PDS) was more potent
than PS. Of note, PI evaluated in BxPC-3 cells had similar
effects. In breast, colon, and pancreatic xenografts PA, PS, and
PI induced apoptosis signiﬁcantly, ranging between 71% and
171% over controls. These results are shown in Table 2, Fig. 2B,
and Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S4.
Induction of necrosis. All 5 compounds induced necrosis
modestly, not exceeding 7.2% of the total number of MDA-MB231 cells (Supplementary Table S1). As with apoptosis, PI was
the most potent inducer of cell necrosis, generating similar
results in BxPC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Induction of cell-cycle arrest. All compounds inhibited
the G1 to S cell-cycle phase transition in MDA-MB-231 cells,
except for PS, which arrested the G2–M phase transition
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Similar effects were
obtained in BxPC-3 cells treated with PI (Supplementary Fig.
S5C).
Induction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species:
correlation with cytokinetic changes
Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) play a
crucial role in the mechanism of action of several anticancer
agents (29–31). We determined the effect of phosphoNSAIDs on the intracellular levels of RONS by the general
RONS probe, DCFDA. Compared with control by 1 hour and
at 1.5  IC50, RONS levels were enhanced 3.3-fold by PI
(BxPC-3 cells), 3-fold by PA (MDA-MB-231 cells), and 1.9-fold

by PS (HT-29 cells); this effect was concentration dependent
(MDA-MB-231 cells; Fig. 3A). Interestingly, pretreatment of
the cells with 10 mmol/L N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) abrogated
RONS induction (completely in MDA-MB-231 cells and by
59% in BxPC-3 cells treated with PI; Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S6A).
A similar effect was documented in vivo, by measuring the
urinary levels of F2-isoprostane in mice; F2-isoprostane is a
marker of oxidative stress (32, 33). As shown in Fig. 3B
and Table 3, PA and PS increased the levels of urinary F2-

isoprostane in mice with MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 xenografts
by between 53% and 338% compared with the corresponding
controls (all changes were statistically signiﬁcant). We then
assessed whether the induction of oxidative stress by phosphoNSAIDs correlated with the cytokinetic changes induced by
these compounds in the xenografts (Fig. 3B). In both MDA-MB231 and HT-29 xenografts, the urinary F2-isoprostane levels
were positively associated with the percentage of apoptotic
cells (R ¼ 0.824, P < 0.01 and R ¼ 0.720, P < 0.02, respectively)
and negatively associated with the percentage of proliferating

A critical redox modulator in the cells is the thioredoxin
(Trx) system (34). We have shown that the thioredoxin
system could mediate redox-induced cell death in response
to various anticancer agents (31). Trx-1, overexpressed
in human cancers, has been linked to aggressive tumor
growth, inhibition of apoptosis, and decreased patient survival (35). In cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, the phospho-

NSAIDs decreased the expression of Trx-1 (Fig. 4A). The
effect of phospho-NSAIDs on Trx-1 expression in xenografts
was variable. In BxPC-3 xenografts, Lipo-PI decreased Trx-1
expression levels by 61.6% (P < 0.001) but plain PI failed to do
so, in keeping with its lack of antitumor effect (Supplementary Fig. S6B). PA and PS also decreased Trx-1 expression in
MDA-MB-231 xenografts by 75% and 63%, respectively (P <
0.05 for both; Fig. 4A). However, in HT-29 xenografts, PS did
not decrease Trx-1 levels, determined both by immunoblotting of tissue extracts and immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
TrxR, overexpressed in many cancers and associated with
drug resistance, represents a key drug target (36). Thus, we
determined the activity of TrxR in cultured breast, colon,

NSAIDs. As shown in Fig. 4B, in MDA-MB-231, BxPC-3, and

for all). PA and PS also decreased the expression of TrxR
in MDA-MB-231 xenografts by 43% and 51% (P < 0.03 and

tumor cell growth, with the outcome depending on biologic
context (38).
In vitro, all 5 compounds inhibited NF-kB activation determined by the EMSA in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(Fig. 5A). A similar inhibitory effect was observed in vivo;
we assessed NF-kB activation in xenografts by determining
immunohistochemically the levels of p-p65 (Fig. 5B). As shown
in Table 4, in MDA-MB-231, HT-29, and BxPC-3 xenografts,
PA and PS, PI and Lipo-PI reduced the percentage of p-p65–

Novel Phospho-NSAIDs As Anticancer Agents

an effect that culminates in enhanced apoptosis and suppressed cancer cell renewal.
The inhibition of cancer growth by phospho-NSAIDs has 5
features. First, it is quantitatively signiﬁcant, as evidenced by
the effect of the 3 compounds tested in xenograft tumor
models. Second, the degree of tumor inhibition differs between
compounds, with PS being the most efﬁcacious. Third, the
response of tumors to a given compound depends on the origin
of the tumor, as shown with PS, which caused tumor stasis in
breast cancer xenografts but only modest growth inhibition in
colon cancer xenografts. Fourth, the mode of drug delivery
seems to inﬂuence drug efﬁcacy substantiall, as shown in the
case of PI, in which efﬁcacy was signiﬁcantly increased by its
incorporation into liposomes. Finally, in contrast to conventional NSAIDs, the phospho-NSAIDs tested in mice appear to
be safe, a ﬁnding consistent with our previous results (20, 21).
An interesting observation concerns the relatively high IC50
values of our compounds in vitro that contrast with their in vivo
efﬁcacy. Although counterintuitive, there are numerous examples of such discordant behavior, including diﬂuoromethylornithine (DFMO), aspirin, and valproic acid, that have IC50
values in the millimolar range but are quite effective in animals
and humans (5, 39, 40). What underlies this difference is not
readily apparent, but the differential complexity of the 2
systems affects the ability of in vitro IC50 values to predict in
vivo responses.
As might be anticipated, tumor growth inhibition by these
compounds is associated with a cytokinetic effect. All phospho-NSAIDs induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation to a
quantitatively signiﬁcant but varying degree; neither effect,
however, seemed dominant. Of interest, our cell culture studies
mirror to some extent the in vivo cytokinetic effect of these
compounds.
A key feature of the mechanism of action of phosphoNSAIDs was their ability to induce oxidative stress. This effect
was noted in both cultured cells and animals. In cultured cells,
the induction of oxidative stress levels was signiﬁcant, concentration dependent, and inhibitable by the antioxidant NAC.
Again, there were individual variations, depending on the cell
line and the compound. In animals, oxidative stress was
assayed by the urinary levels of F2-isoprostane. This metabolite
of 15-isoprostane F2t (PGF2a) provides a validated measure of
oxidative stress in the animal over some period of time (usually
hours). As we have shown recently, in the case of PI, the
xenograft is indeed the source of the increased F2-isoprostane
(30). Thus, we can extrapolate that the oxidative stress that we
observed in these studies originated in the xenografts. The
induction of oxidative stress by the phospho-NSAIDs was a
consequential event. There is a clear association between
oxidative stress and cytokinetic changes (enhanced apoptosis,
suppressed proliferation) both in vitro and, importantly, in vivo.
To a ﬁrst approximation, these changes underlie the tumorinhibitory effect of these compounds, making the redox
homeostatic mechanism their prime molecular target.
Although cell signaling tends to be complex, the effect of the
phospho-NSAIDs on the NF-kB pathway illustrates a possible
link between drug-induced oxidative stress and cancer growth
inhibition. It is conceivable that the anticancer effect of

www.aacrjournals.org

phospho-NSAIDs is related in part to their redox effect on
NF-kB, a prototypical redox-sensitive signaling pathway with
relevance to cancer. Constitutive NF-kB activation is a hallmark of various types of cancer, including breast, colon, and
pancreatic (41–44). NF-kB, activated by oncogenes, carcinogens, and inﬂammatory stimuli, promotes carcinogenesis and
consequently has become a therapeutic target in cancer. When
the strategically located Cys62 of NF-kB is oxidized, the NF-kB
dimmer is rendered incapable of binding to DNA and thus loses
its extensive transcriptional effects. Phospho-NSAIDs inhibited NF-kB activation both in vitro and in vivo. This is a broader
property of phospho-NSAIDs, which we recently showed to
inhibit NF-kB activation in arthritis-associated inﬂammation
(20). It is plausible that the effect of phospho-NSAIDs mediates
part of their anticancer effect.
Equally complex is the mechanism by which these compounds induce oxidative stress. The central role of ROS as an
apoptotic trigger in response to phospho-NSAIDs was documented recently (30). In this work, we focused on the thioredoxin system that consists of Trx, TrxR, and NADPH. A
pivotal component of cellular redox homeostasis, the thioredoxin system, is involved in carcinogenesis and also in the
response of tumors to chemotherapy (45–47). When RONS
oxidize a cellular protein, thioredoxin reduces it, being itself
oxidized in the process; TrxR restores the oxidized Trx to its
normal status. Phospho-NSAIDs had a profound effect on the 2
protein members of this system, Trx-1 and TrxR. The expression of both was suppressed by phospho-NSAIDs and, in
addition, the activity of TrxR (the only one of the 2 that was
assayed for) was suppressed, generating a substantial cumulative effect. In only one case (HT-29 xenografts) the expression
of Trx-1 was not suppressed by a phospho-NSAID (PS), but
both the activity and expression of TrxR was suppressed, likely
inactivating the thioredoxin system. Of note, PS did suppress
Trx-1 expression in HT-29 xenografts treated under a different
drug administration protocol (22). It is, therefore, clear, that
based on the role of the thioredoxin system this effect contributes to the induction of the all-important state of oxidative
stress with its direct repercussion on tumor mass (loss of cells
through apoptosis and dampened cell renewal). Indeed,
between the 2, TrxR was the one that was suppressed the
most by the phospho-NSAIDs. Consistently, we have shown in
an effective combination study of PS and DFMO that TrxR
correlated with tumor growth, stressing the importance of the
Trx system as a molecular target of these drugs (22).
In conclusion, our ﬁndings indicate that these 5 phosphoNSAIDs, belonging to the broader pharmacologic category of
modiﬁed-NSAIDs, show strong anticancer efﬁcacy and promising safety. Of particular interest is their shared ability to
induce oxidative stress, an early event that seems to trigger
cancer-inhibitory cascades. Taken together, our data indicate
that phospho-NSAIDs merit further evaluation as anticancer
agents.
