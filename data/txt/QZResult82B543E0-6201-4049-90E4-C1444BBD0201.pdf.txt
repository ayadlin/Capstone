BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status influence the outcome of locoregional treatments. However, the interrelationship of these factors with trastuzumab is unclear. In
this study, the role of HR and HER2 status on the locoregional benefit of trastuzumab treatment was investigated in patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Locoregional outcomes of 5683 women treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center from 2000 to 2008 for invasive breast cancer were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods to compare 6
subgroups: HR-positive (HRþ)/HER2-negative (HER2), HR/HER2 (triple-negative), HRþ/HER2þ with or without trastuzumab,
and HR/HER2þ with or without trastuzumab. RESULTS: Overall, locoregional recurrence (LRR) was 5% at 5 years among patients
with HER2þ disease. Patients with HRþ/HER2þ disease treated with trastuzumab had half the rate of LRR as patients who did not
receive trastuzumab, whereas patients with HR/HER2þ disease had similar rates of LRR regardless of trastuzumab treatment. On
Cox regression analysis comparing LRR risk to the cohort with HRþ/HER2 disease, only the HRþ/HER2þ cohort treated with trastuzumab had similar LRR risk (hazard ratio ¼ 1.24, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.56-2.73, P ¼ .591). All other subgroups, including the
HRþ/HER2þ cohort who did not receive trastuzumab, had significantly worse outcomes. LRR risk was highest among patients with
triple-negative disease (hazard ratio ¼ 4.73, 95% confidence interval ¼ 3.42-6.54, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with
HRþ/HER2þ disease, treatment with trastuzumab reduces LRR risk to the more favorable outcome of patients with HRþ/HER2 disease. In contrast, the increased LRR risk among patients with HR/HER2þ disease remains despite treatment with trastuzumab. AddiC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of biologic subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes. Previous publications have demonstrated survival differences between hormone receptor (HR)-positive subtypes versus human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2/neu (HER2)-overexpressing or triple-negative subtypes.1-3 Moreover, differences in locoregional
outcomes among molecular classes of breast cancer defined by HR and HER2 status have also been reported.4 However,
these reports largely predate the introduction of trastuzumab (Herceptin; F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Following several studies5-7 that established the survival benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab compared to chemotherapy
alone, recent reports have examined the systemic efficacy of trastuzumab in relation to HR status and found trastuzumab to be
of equal benefit for HRþ/HER2þ and HR/HER2þ disease.7,8 However, there are no current data available to determine
whether the locoregional benefits of trastuzumab for patients with HER2þ disease are dependent on HR status. Indeed, the
role of HR status itself varies in the setting of locoregional versus systemic therapy, where HR-negativity is associated with a
greater response to chemotherapy and HR-positivity is associated with higher radiosensitivity. Thus, the predictive factors that
determine locoregional outcomes may be inherently different than those that determine systemic disease control.
Understanding the relationship between known determinants of locoregional outcome is important, because locoregional disease status directly influences breast cancer–specific survival. In this study, we investigated the interrelationship
of HR and HER2 status with trastuzumab treatment and its effect on locoregional outcomes of patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Women with biopsy-proven, invasive breast cancer and confirmed HER2 and HR status who were diagnosed between
2000 and 2008 and treated with definitive locoregional and systemic therapy were included in this analysis. Beginning in

Hormone Receptor Influences Trastuzumab/Kim et al

2004, adjuvant trastuzumab was increasingly used in clinical practice at our institution (The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex), and the
inclusion of patients treated from 2000 to 2008 ensured
an adequate sample size of patients with HER2-positive
disease who either received or did not receive trastuzumab
as part of their definitive therapy. Patients who developed
locoregional recurrence (LRR) prior to presentation at
our institution or who were found to have locoregional
recurrence within 1 month of presentation were excluded
(n ¼ 414). In total, 5683 women with an index primary
breast cancer met inclusion criteria and were included in
this analysis. This study was approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and
waiver of consent was obtained.
Patients were divided into receptor subgroups as
defined by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PR), and HER2 status and stratified by whether they did
or did not receive treatment with trastuzumab. Six patient
subgroups were defined in this manner: 1) ER- and/or
PR-positive, HER2-negative (HRþ/HER2, n ¼ 3218);
2) ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive, not treated
with trastuzumab (HRþ/HER2þ/No Tz, n ¼ 322); 3)
ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive, treated with
trastuzumab (HRþ/HER2þ/Yes Tz, n ¼ 314); 4) ERand PR-negative, HER2-positive, not treated with trastuzumab (HR/HER2þ/No Tz, n ¼ 257); 5) ER- and
PR-negative, HER2-positive, treated with trastuzumab
(HR/HER2þ/Yes Tz, n ¼ 292); 6) and triple-negative
(n ¼ 1280). Cases were designated as HER2-positive if
they demonstrated gene amplification on fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), or a membranous staining
score of 3þ on immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.
HER2 copy number that was not amplified by FISH testing or read as 0-1þ by IHC was designated as HER2-negative. Six cases that were IHC 3þ/FISH-negative who
received trastuzumab were considered to be HER2-positive. Cases that were IHC 2þ without a confirmatory
FISH result were excluded from analysis (n ¼ 168). For
ER and PR status, tumors with 1% or more positive tumor nuclei were considered positive.
Patients were seen in follow-up 4 to 6 months after
completion of their definitive treatment, every 4 to 6
months during the first 5 years, and annually thereafter
with imaging and clinical examination. Follow-up time
was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of
LRR, the date when the patient was last known to be free
of LRR, or death. Any relapse within the intact breast or
ipsilateral chest wall, and/or ipsilateral axillary, internal
mammary, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular nodal basins

was considered a locoregional event regardless of systemic
disease status. Ten patients were considered to have an
event at time zero due to locoregional progression during
the course of their curative-intent therapy.
All analyses were performed using SPSS, release
17.0.2 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) and Stata, release 12
(StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex). Differences in
prognostic factors between patient subgroups were analyzed using the chi-square method. Kaplan-Meier analysis
was used to calculate locoregional survival outcomes and
compared by the log-rank statistic. Cox regression methods were used to estimate LRR risk among the 6 receptor
subgroups. Covariables included age at diagnosis, menopausal status, stage group, T-stage, N-stage, nuclear grade,
lymphovascular space invasion, surgery type and receipt
of radiation therapy, surgical margin status, and treatment
with chemotherapy. The proportional hazards assumption was tested and upheld. All tests were 2-sided with a
significance level of .05.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of Receptor Subgroups

Median follow-up for all patients was 52 months (interquartile range, 2-121 months). Among the 6 receptor subgroups, the cohort with HRþ/HER2 disease had the
most favorable characteristics, including a higher percentage of Stage I tumors (T1 N0 M0; [T1] tumor 2 cm or
less in greatest dimension; [N0] no regional lymph node
metastases; [M0] no distant metastases), and fewer tumors
of high-grade histology. In contrast, the triple-negative
cohort had a higher rate of advanced nodal disease and
were more likely to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Baseline characteristics of patients with HRþ/
HER2þ status stratified according to trastuzumab treatment are listed in Table 1. The vast majority of patients
with HRþ/HER2þ disease who received trastuzumab
were treated after 2004 (P < .001) and more often presented with N3 disease (P ¼ .005). They also had higher
rates of positive or close surgical margins compared with
their counterparts who were not treated with trastuzumab
(P ¼ .006). This was due to a slightly higher number of
cases with positive/close surgical margins after 2004
among the HRþ/HER2þ, trastuzumab-treated cohort
undergoing mastectomy (7 of 185 patients) compared
with those not treated with trastuzumab (0 of 190
patients). Over time, a slight increase in breast-conserving
surgery was seen among patients with HRþ/HER2þ disease; however, no corresponding change in the rate of positive/close surgical margins was seen among these patients
before and after 2004 whether they were (P ¼ .504) or

were not (P ¼ .254) treated with trastuzumab. For systemic treatment, HRþ/HER2þ patients treated with
trastuzumab were more likely to receive both anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant
and adjuvant settings (both P < .001). The majority of
patients with HRþ disease were treated with hormone
therapy, and there was no significant difference in the frequency of hormone therapy treatment between the HRþ/
HER2þ trastuzumab-treated cohort compared with those
not treated with trastuzumab (P ¼ .124), although an
increasing percentage of postmenopausal women were
treated with an aromatase inhibitor versus tamoxifen during the latter part of the study period, when trastuzumab
was in greater use.
Baseline characteristics of patients with HR/
HER2þ disease stratified by trastuzumab treatment are
listed in Table 2. Patients with HR/HER2þ disease
treated with trastuzumab were mainly treated after 2004
(P < .001), and were more likely to have stage III disease
due to T4 or N3 disease at presentation (all P < .010).
They were more likely to receive neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy than their counterparts who were not
treated with trastuzumab (all P < .001).

LRR Outcomes of Receptor Subgroups

Overall, locoregional recurrence rates were low in the
entire cohort. At 5 years, the lowest rate of LRR was seen
among patients with HRþ/HER2 disease (2% or 72
total locoregional events). Patients with triple-negative
disease had the highest LRR rate at 5 years (9% or 102
events). In patients with HER2þ disease, LRR rates varied according to HR status and treatment with trastuzumab. Among patients with HRþ/HER2þ disease, 5-year
LRR rates were 3% (8 events) among patients treated with
trastuzumab versus 6% (18 events) among patients who
were not. In contrast, among patients with HR/
HER2þ disease, 5-year LRR rates were similar (6%)
whether patients did or did not receive trastuzumab (14
and 17 total locoregional events, respectively). Cumulative LRR rates among all patients with HR-positive disease and HR-negative disease are depicted in Figures 1
and 2, respectively.
On univariate analysis in comparison with the
HRþ/HER2 cohort, all patient subgroups had higher
LRR risk except the group of patients with HRþ/
HER2þ disease who were treated with trastuzumab,
which did not significantly differ from the referent group.
All other intercomparisons between receptor subgroups
did not reach statistical significance.

Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis

In comparison with the favorable HRþ/HER2 cohort,
only patients with HRþ/HER2þ disease who were
treated with trastuzumab had similar LRR risk (hazard
ratio ¼ 1.24, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.56-2.73, P ¼
.591, Table 3). All other subgroups had a significantly
higher risk of LRR, including patients with HRþ/
HER2þ disease who were not treated with trastuzumab.
Patients with HR/HER2þ disease had greater than
twice the risk of LRR, regardless of trastuzumab treatment. Patients with triple-negative disease had the highest
LRR risk (hazard ratio ¼ 4.73, 95% confidence
interval ¼ 3.42-6.54, P < .001). No other intercomparisons between receptor subgroups revealed significant differences in LRR risk, except the triple-negative cohort
which consistently demonstrated higher LRR risk than all
other subgroups.
Addition of an interaction term for receptor subgroup by locoregional treatment to the Cox regression
model was not significant (P ¼ .19), indicating that the
LRR risk conferred by the various HR and HER2 subgroups was independent of surgery type or radiation treatment (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown that the interrelationship of
HR and HER2 status on LRR risk is influenced by treatment with trastuzumab, and confirm that receptor subtypes of breast cancer (as defined by HR and HER2
status) affect the risk of LRR after definitive treatment.
Our findings suggest that treatment with trastuzumab is
associated with reduced LRR risk in patients with HRþ/
HER2þ disease to a rate similar to that of HRþ/HER2
status. In contrast, LRR risk among the HR-negative
cohort remains elevated even for the subgroup of patients
with HR/HER2þ disease who receive trastuzumab,
compared with patients with HRþ disease.
Among 5 prospective clinical trials that evaluated
the benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab with standard chemotherapy for high-risk, early stage breast cancer,5-7 only one
study evaluated the effect of HR status on the efficacy of
trastuzumab. In the combined analysis of the B31/9831
trials, outcomes following adjuvant trastuzumab were
similar whether patients had HR-positive or HR-negative
disease, suggesting that the directional benefit of trastuzumab on disease-free survival is independent of ER/PR
status.7 No LRR data stratified according to HR status
has been published from these studies. Moreover, locoregional events comprised fewer than 25% of all first events
in the control and experimental arms of both studies, and

the impact of LRR on the reported disease-free survival
outcomes is significantly less than other classes of events.
Several studies have examined the interrelationship
between HR status and the benefit of trastuzumab in
patients who were treated for metastatic disease. A retrospective analysis of 3 clinical trials that evaluated the role
of trastuzumab as monotherapy or in combination with
chemotherapy as first-, second-, or third-line treatment in
patients with metastatic breast cancer did not reveal a difference in overall response rate or time to progression in
relation to HR status.9 In a more recent retrospective
study that evaluated the role of HR status and the benefit

of trastuzumab among patients with metastatic breast cancer treated at 2 European centers, high expression of ER
(30% of tumor cells) predicted for reduced response to
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy; however, when endocrine therapy was added to the regimen of patients with
ER-positive tumors, a significant progression-free survival
benefit was seen.8 These findings are consistent with 2
recent randomized trials that examined the benefit of
combining trastuzumab and endocrine therapy as firstline treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer
that coexpresses HR and HER2.10,11 In these trials, dual
blockade of these signaling pathways led to significant
improvement in progression-free survival in the experimental arms.
Recent preclinical work has described the potential
interaction between HR and growth factor receptor signaling. This cross-talk may involve supersensitivity to low

tyrosine kinase inhibitors.12-14 A recent study demonstrated that following neoadjuvant chemotherapy containing trastuzumab, pathologic response was highest in
ER-negative, HER2-positive tumors, and progressively
decreased with increasing ER coexpression.15 These findings would predict a LRR benefit among patients treated
with trastuzumab for ER-negative, HER2-positive
tumors compared to patients with ER-positive, HER2positive disease. In our study, we did not find a significant difference in LRR risk between these 2 cohorts, and
the hazard ratio for LRR was higher among patients with
HR-negative disease. This difference may be attributable
to our definition of HR-positivity, which included PR
expression, as well as the degree of HR receptor positivity, which was not quantified in this analysis. Nonetheless, our findings do suggest an interaction between HR
and HER2 status and the locoregional response to trastuzumab treatment.
Little clinical data exist on the interaction of HR
and HER2 status on locoregional outcomes in the trastuzumab era. In a recent retrospective study of 582 patients,
in which 86% of HER2þ patients received trastuzumab,
HER2-positivity was associated with significantly reduced
LRR risk.4 This study also examined the LRR risk of the
triple-negative subgroup in relation to other receptor subtypes, but did not evaluate the influence of HR subgroups
on the LRR benefit of trastuzumab treatment. Although
several reports have now demonstrated the locoregional
benefit of trastuzumab treatment in HER2þ breast
cancer,4,5,16 the locoregional benefit of trastuzumab in
relation to HR status has not been clearly elucidated. To
our knowledge, our study is the first to characterize LRR
risk among receptor subgroups prior to and since the
introduction of trastuzumab. Among patients with HRþ/
HER2þ disease, we found that treatment with trastuzumab reduced the rate of LRR by 50% compared to
patients who were not treated with trastuzumab, whereas
patients with HR/HER2þ disease had similar rates of
LRR regardless of trastuzumab treatment. Moreover, we
found that all receptor subgroups had higher LRR than
the cohort with HRþ/HER2 disease, except the HRþ/
HER2þ cohort treated with trastuzumab, whose LRR
outcomes did not significantly differ from the favorable
HRþ/HER2 subgroup. These findings confirm the role
of HR-negativity and HER2 overexpression in increasing
LRR risk, and help to elucidate the relationship of HR status on locoregional outcomes among patients treated with
trastuzumab for HER2þ disease. Moreover, these find4942

ings were independent of type of locoregional treatment
administered, although the low number of events limited
power to identify small differences in LRR risk among receptor subgroups undergoing breast-conserving surgery
versus mastectomy.
In addition to the limitations and biases of retrospective studies, the overall low locoregional event rate
limited the statistical analysis in this study, despite our
sample size of more than 5000 patients. Moreover, the
shorter follow-up time of patients who were treated with
trastuzumab may overestimate the benefit of treatment. A
quantitative analysis of HR expression was not undertaken in this study, which may have provided additional
insight into the interaction between HR status and locoregional outcomes following treatment with trastuzumab.
This is the first study to examine the predictive efficacy of trastuzumab on locoregional outcomes in relation
to HR and HER2 status. Although patients with HRþ/
HER2þ disease appeared to derive a locoregional control
benefit from trastuzumab, we were not able to demonstrate a similar benefit among patients with HR/
HER2þ disease. This novel finding suggests a complex
interplay between HR status, HER2 status, and their corresponding targeted therapies in mediating LRR risk.
Future studies evaluating locoregional treatment questions should stratify patients not only on the basis of HR
and HER2 status, but also on the basis of treatment with
trastuzumab. Such an approach may facilitate more accurate risk assessment among patients with biologically variant disease.
