ABSTRACT
We hypothesized that aberrations activating epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) via dimerization would be more sensitive to anti-dimerization agents (e.g.,
cetuximab). EGFR exon 19 abnormalities (L747_A750del; deletes amino acids LREA)
respond to reversible EGFR kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Exon 20 in-frame insertions
and/or duplications (codons 767 to 774) and T790M mutations are clinically resistant
to reversible/some irreversible TKIs. Their impact on protein function/therapeutic
actionability are not fully elucidated.
In our study, the index patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
harbored EGFR D770_P772del_insKG (exon 20). A twenty patient trial (NSCLC
cohort) (cetuximab-based regimen) included two participants with EGFR TKIresistant mutations ((i) exon 20 D770>GY; and (ii) exon 19 LREA plus exon 20
T790M mutations). Structural modeling predicted that EGFR exon 20 anomalies
(D770_P772del_insKG and D770>GY), but not T790M mutations, stabilize the active
dimer configuration by increasing the interaction between the kinase domains, hence
sensitizing to an agent preventing dimerization. Consistent with predictions, the two
patients harboring D770_P772del_insKG and D770>GY, respectively, responded to
an EGFR antibody (cetuximab)-based regimen; the T790M-bearing patient showed no
response to cetuximab combined with erlotinib. In silico modeling merits investigation
of its ability to optimize therapeutic selection based on structural/functional
implications of different aberrations within the same gene.

INTRODUCTION

(~4 to ~13 percent each), MET and HER2 amplification
are operative in resistance [7, 8]. A small, but important,
subgroup of patients carry EGFR exon 20 insertion
mutations (in-frame insertions and/or duplications of 3 to
21 base pairs clustered between codons 767 and 774 in
EGFR exon 20), which are known to be generally resistant
to both reversible and new irreversible TKIs in the clinic
[3].
The extracellular antibody cetuximab can also target

Patients suffering from lung cancers that harbor
EGFR-sensitive mutations are responsive to reversible
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib
[1, 2]. In about 60% of cases initially sensitive to reversible
EGFR inhibitors, the T790M mutation emerges; these are
generally resistant to both reversible and some irreversible
TKIs (e.g., afatinib) in the clinic [3–6]. In other patients

EGFR. It functions by partially blocking the EGFR ligandbinding domain and sterically hindering exposure of the
dimerization domain, hence decreasing docking of the
two monomeric EGFRs to each other and, in this way,
attenuating dimerization-dependent EGFR activity [9].
Antitumor activity of cetuximab is observed in patients
with EGFR wild-type colorectal and head and neck
cancers, but not in many other tumor types [10–12]. The
mechanism of action of wild-type EGFR is primarily
driven by receptor dimerization followed by kinase
activation [13]. Shan and colleagues have postulated that
EGFR L834R exon 21 mutations (also called L858R)
counteract the intrinsic disorder in the EGFR kinase and,
therefore, facilitate dimerization, which in turn promotes
kinase activation [2].
To date, the exact mechanisms by which each of
the EGFR mutations mediates pathway activation and
carcinogenesis remains incompletely elucidated. Further,
there are multiple reversible and irreversible EGFR TKI
inhibitors and antibodies available for clinical use, but
matching patients with an individual agent occurs largely
based on empiric data. We therefore modeled the structure
of EGFR mutants in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and correlated clinical outcomes with
predicted functional implications. These studies form a
proof-of-principle demonstration of the ability of in silico
modeling to be used to choose therapy for individuals,
and suggest that further investigation in larger cohorts of
patients is needed.

RESULTS
Structural modeling

D770 region (insertion exon 20) mutants
Exon 20 region is the same in the wild type (wt)
and the modeled exon 19 LREA mutant (Figure 1A), but
differs from the two modeled exon 20 mutants’ possible
structures (D770>GY, Figure 1B and D770_P772del_
insKG, Figure 1C). Erlotinib has a similar position inside
the wt or LREA mutant EGFR tyrosine kinase pocket. It
is docked in the ATP-binding pocket without constraints
(Figure 1A). When the mutation D770>GY is introduced,
it can create significant changes in the conformation of
the loop (yellow in Figure 1B). Its conformation is quite
different in comparison with the wt loop (Figure 1A).
This conformation can be stabilized by a hydrogen bond
between the residues ASN772 and TYR828, π-cation
interaction of ARG777 with TRP731, and hydrophobic
interactions of VAL77 with LEU834 and VAL73, PRO81
with TYR136. Residue CYS275 located in the “back wall”
of the ATP-binding pocket plays a role in positioning of

(Figure 3A).
We measured the electrostatic interactions between
the two kinase domains of the EGFR dimer in active
configuration and found that both mutations (D770_
P772del_insKG and D770>GY) increase the attractive
negative energy of inter-protein interaction (Table 1,
Figure 4). The positive potential of the D770_P772del_
insKG mutation region (outlined by dashed squares in
Figure 3B) increases versus wild type (Figure 3A) with
the subsequent increase in electrostatic interactions
between the kinase domains of EGFR. This effect leads to
“stabilization” of the dimeric active position. EGFR exists
in equilibrium between the active and inactive dimers, and
when it stays longer in the active dimer position, it would
be more active.

incoming erlotinib. After a D770>GY mutation, residue
CYS275 is located significantly farther from the drug’s
closest heavy atom. The absence of such a wall residue
makes position of the drug in the pocket less defined
(not having energy minimum in a proper position) and it
can be significantly shifted. Such a shift can affect ATP
competition for the binding site with the drug and activate
the kinase despite erlotinib.
In the D770_P772del_insKG mutant, the new
conformation of the loop (yellow in Figure 1C) is
stabilized by the set of hydrophobic interactions.
Specifically, interactions of: VAL769 with PHE855
and VAL765; VAL773 with ILE852; and CYS774 with
MET766 and the hydrophobic “stem” of LYS851. The
resulting loop has CYS775 also located quite far from
the previous position with consequences similar to those
described above for the D770>GY mutation. While the
question of resistance of exon 20 mutants to the reversible
EGFR inhibitors has been previously discussed [14, 15],
the other issue as to why these mutations activate EGFR
has not been well described. One of the explanations can
be that these mutants can introduce some uncertainty in
the position of ATP with changes in its phosphorylation
potential. Another explanation can be related to changes
in the electrostatic docking profile of the kinase’s active
dimer. The active configuration of this dimer is very tight
and practically does not leave possible water enclaves
(Figure 2). This fact increases the importance of possible
electrostatic interactions between the domains that have a
number of complementary positive and negative regions

T790M mutant
The T790M mutation can result in enhanced
affinity for ATP, and the subsequent activation is at

red—negative (‑0.75e). The mutated regions are outlined by
the dashed square. The positive potential of the “left” kinase
domains increases and extends closer to the negative potential
of the “right” kinase domain. This fact causes increase of the
attractive electrostatic energy of interaction: (A) WT EGFR;
(B) D770_P772del_insKG mutant. The significant increase of
positive electrostatic potential in the area of dimer interface is
caused by the exon 20 insertion aberrations.

least five fold compared to wild type [16]. In general,
lung cancers caused by activating EGFR mutations are
initially responsive to TKIs until second mutations, such
as T790M, emerge and confer resistance by sterically
blocking binding of TKIs [4]. Erlotinib docks to the ATPbinding pocket of EGFR without serious restraints in
the case of the sensitive exon 19 LREA mutant (Figure
5A). The T790M mutation brings structural changes to
the ATP-binding pocket (Figure 5B). Specifically, the
bulky hydrophobic chain of MET790 that substitutes for
THR790 (Figure 5B) will prevent the proper positioning
of erlotinib and other reversible TKIs, introducing
resistance to them. At the same time, the irreversible
inhibitor afatinib, despite close resemblance to erlotinib’s
structure, inhibits the T790M mutant EGFR, at least in
preclinical models (albeit with only minimal activity in
the clinic) [17, 18]. Crystal structure of the kinase domain
of EGFR with afatinib (Figure 5C) shows that it forces
conformational changes in MET790 side chains [17]. A
covalent bond between the drug and CYS797 causes this
effect, making afatinib more stable in the binding position.
When the side chain of MET790 is in the conformation
adjusted to afatinib binding, that position would compete
with ATP and allow afatinib to some extent to serve as a
drug.
We checked the impact of T790M mutation on
energy of interactions between the kinase domains of the
active dimer of EGFR. We used the same method as for
all abovementioned mutants. We found that there were
no changes in electrostatic energy of the kinase domain

interactions and consequently no changes of activity of
EGFR (and no response to cetuximab) are predicted for
that mutant (Table 1).

LREA deletion mutant
The del747–750 mutation in exon 19 activates
EGFR. This mutation can significantly change the
conformation of a protein in this region from the initial
(Figure 6A) to the conformation with increased attractive
electrostatic energy between the kinase domains of EGFR
(Figure 6B, Table 1). This change can also prolong the
“active dimer” configurational state. The effect of the
LREA mutation on the active dimer stabilization can be
less than that of the exon 20 aberrations D770_P772del_
insKG and D770>GY because of positioning of the
residues 747–750 close to the surface of the protein in
the LREA mutation. The LREA mutation however may
be sensitive to cetuximab too, albeit less so than the
exon 20 insertion deletion mutants. Taking into account
that the LREA mutant is known to be sensitive to the
reversible TKI inhibitors, it may be that combination
therapy (including an EGFR TKI inhibitor and EGFR
antibody) can enhance response. Such a conclusion would,
however, require a randomized study of an EGFR TKI
versus an EGFR TKI combined with EGFR antibody, in
order to be validated in patients. Based on this structural
and electrostatic profile analysis, it would be predicted
that when the somatic mutation T790M occurs, the

DISCUSSION

combination therapy would no longer be effective because
of resistance of T790M to reversible TKI.

Our findings demonstrate that the exon 20 mutations
EGFR D770_P772del_insKG and D770>GY (both
resistant to EGFR reversible TKIs) [3] and exon 19 LREA
del (EGFR reversible TKI-sensitive) [1], but not T790M
(reversible TKI-resistant) [4, 5], can activate EFGR by
increasing the attractive electrostatic energy between
the monomer subunits of its kinase domains. The more
attractive energies of interaction between the EGFR
subunits would lead to more time that the receptor would
stay in the active dimer conformation (Figure 1, Table
1). A question that could be raised is whether the values
of changes of electrostatic energy are significant enough
to cause changes in stability of the dimer (Table 1). To
address this question, we reviewed the energies of intermolecular interactions in known dimers of other proteins
having dimensions that are close to those of the EGFR
kinase domains. For the Ras–Raf dimer, the experimental
value of inter-protein binding free energy is ‑40.2 kJ/mol

Patients
Three patients with known EGFR-(reversible
TKI) resistant mutations (two with insertions in exon 20
(Table 2, Cases 1 and 2) and one with an exon 20 T790M
mutation (Case 3) were treated with an EGFR antibody
(cetuximab)-based regimen. Both patients with insertions
in exon 20 achieved durable partial remissions consistent
with the predictions from our structural modeling (Table
2, Figures 7 and 8). The third patient, having the exon
19 (LREA-type) mutation, initially responded to the
reversible TKI inhibitor erlotinib (partial remission for
17 months); at the time that the T790M was detected,
the patient failed to respond to erlotinib combined with
cetuximab, again consistent with the molecular structure
predictions.

acids ASP974 and ASP976, respectively, without significant impact to the electrostatic interaction between the subunits. (B) LREAdel
mutant changes significantly the conformation of this loop and puts the positive ARG744 close to the above-mentioned pair of negative
residues. This increases of the attractive energy of intersubunit interaction and leads to the more stable dimer state of the EGFR.

[19] and the theoretical value is ‑62.8+26.4 kJ/mol [20].
(For the Ras–RalGDS, the experimental and theoretical
values are correspondingly ‑35.2 kJ/mol [19] and ‑81.6
+24.7 kJ/mol [20].) For the “specially designed for
electrostatic interaction” complex of barnase and barstar
the calculated electrostatic energy is ‑61.9 kJ/mol [21].
Therefore, our values of electrostatic attractive energies
from ‑60 to ‑93 kJ/mol (Table 1) are comparable with
energies that are responsible for stability of other protein
complexes.
The results of our structural and electrostatic profile
analysis suggest that an antibody such as cetuximab, which
functions by preventing receptor dimerization, might be
effective in exon 20 insertion aberrations and, to a lesser

extent, in LREA exon 19 mutants. Cetuximab binds to
EGFR domain III and covers an epitope that partially
overlaps with the ligand-binding site. The heavy chain
of cetuximab also sterically prevents domain I of EGFR
from adopting the conformation required for dimerization
[22–24].
Of interest in this regard, we report three patients
treated with EGFR antibody cetuximab-based regimens
(Table 2). Two of these patients had mutations considered
resistant to EGFR TKI inhibitors (D770>GY and D770_
P772delsinKG (both in exon 20)), yet attained partial
remissions on cetuximab-based therapy (Figures 7 and
8). One patient continues to do well on treatment for
over 3.5 years (Table 2, Patient #1, and Figure 7). In

contrast, a patient with the exon 20 T790M EGFR-TKI
resistant mutation (in addition to the exon 19 sensitive
LREAdel aberration) did not respond to the combination
of cetuximab and erlotinib (Table 2, Patient #3). Typically,
these patients present with the sensitive EGFR LREAdel
aberrations and initially respond to reversible TKIs such as
erlotinib (and, a salutary effect of erlotinib was indeed seen
in our patient early in the disease course), but the resistant
T790M mutation then emerges [4]. Similarly Janjigian
and colleagues failed to show activity for the erlotinib/
cetuximab combination in patients with NSCLC and
acquired resistance to erlotinib due to T790M mutations
[25]. Our clinical observations are supported by the in
silico modeling data (Figures 1 and 5), which demonstrate
that exon 20 insertion aberrations would be expected to
increase the attractive electrostatic dimerization energies,
and such a change could be predicted to predispose to
response to an EGFR antibody that attenuates or interferes
with dimerization. Further, our modeling suggests that
the LREA mutation can react to the combination of
cetuximab and erlotinib, but the combination of LREA and
T790M mutations can compromise this effect because of
resistance of T790M mutant to TKI. Although there are
limitations to this study, e.g., the small number of patients
and the fact that the responders received combination
therapy, the expected rate of response to the other drugs
in the combination is low. These data suggest that some
patients with gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant EGFR mutations,
especially those in the amino acid 770 region of exon 20,
may benefit from therapy with EGFR antibodies.
Recently, several reports have postulated that the
molecular heterogeneity and complexity of signaling
in metastatic cancer can be distilled down to several
pathways by analysis of convergence, interactions, and
hubs [26–29]. While identifying convergence pathways
is without a doubt important, it is also increasingly
apparent that distinct mutations in the same gene or
pathway can have vastly different effects, and real-time
in silico modeling may therefore be an important tool
for precision therapy. The current proof-of-principle
report demonstrates cetuximab response in patients with
EGFR aberrations in exon 20 (D770_P772del_insKG and
D770>GY); these aberrations are resistant to EGFR TKIs.
The response was predicted by in silico modeling, because
the modeling showed that these molecular abnormalities
activate EGFR by increasing the stability of the active
dimer, and cetuximab is an EGFR antibody that interferes
with dimerization.
In conclusion, as analysis of oncogenic aberrations
in patients with cancer is adopted in practice, there is
often still an assumption that distinct abnormalities in
the same gene produce a similar or identical effect. Yet
the functional impact of distinct aberrations in the same
gene may differ greatly. For instance, if a mutation
increases interaction of the members of the dimer leading
to activation of a kinase, the optimal treatment may be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an antibody that interferes with dimerization. If, on the
other hand, a mutation increases the activity of the kinase,
facilitating a switch to an active conformation, the ideal
treatment might be a compound that preserves the inactive
conformation, etc. In silico modeling, such as that in the
current proof-of-principle study, as well as computerbased, decision-making systems, are therefore likely to
be needed for best understanding anomalies in multiple
genes beyond EGFR. It will be worthwhile to perform
larger studies in order to confirm these observations and
to determine if in silico modeling can be more widely
exploited to precisely match patients harboring EGFR
and other aberrations with drugs, so that response can be
optimized.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rationale for molecular modeling use in these
studies
EGFR can form two different dimers. The first
symmetric dimer is inactive, while the second, asymmetric
dimer is active. EGFR dimerization activates the
EGFR function. There are no direct residue-to-residue
electrostatic contacts between the kinase domains of
the active dimer, and electrostatic interactions are not
considered as a main driving force of its formation. Indeed,
the electrostatic interactions would not be the main reason
for EGFR dimerization. Nevertheless in the active dimer
there exists very close complementary contact between
the kinase domains. Such a situation makes the dielectric
constant in the interface zone comparable to the constant
inside the protein. When such a condition arises, more
distant than direct salt-bridge electrostatic interactions
would became important. Mutations that increase
electrostatic interactions between the kinase domains
would keep the dimer in the active position longer and
would increase the general activity of EGFR. To check
this hypothesis, we measured the energy of electrostatic
interaction between the kinase domains in the active
EGFR dimer (for wt and mutated proteins). Structural
modeling of EGFR kinase mutants has been used before
for prediction of EGFR drug resistance to erlotinib and
gefitinib [14] and cetuximab [30] based on calculations
of energies of drug-protein interactions. Nevertheless, to
our knowledge, there are no reports describing modeling
of EGFR mutants’ impact on this protein’s dimerization
and consequent activation, and the clinical implications in
individual patients.
The mutations studied (D770_P772del_insKG,
D770>GY, and del747–750 (LREA)) include charged
residues. These mutations are not just substitutions
of one amino acid to another. D770_P772del_insKG
makes the region shorter by one amino acid; D770>GY,

longer by one amino acid; LREA, shorter by four amino
acids. In all these cases, such changes would affect the
tertiary structure of the protein. To elucidate a molecular
mechanism explaining the function of these mutations,
we conducted modeling of EGFR tertiary structure, and
measured the effect of the mutations on interactions
between two kinase domains of the EGFR dimer in the
active state.

Patients
Structural modeling of EGFR mutants was used,
along with results of Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA)-approved molecular tests for
EGFR (next generation sequencing or polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based sequencing). The index
patient (Table 2, Case 2) was assessed to predict EGFR
antibody responsiveness; this patient had an insertion
exon 20 mutation known to be resistant to EGFR small
molecule reversible kinase inhibitors [3]. (Modeling
suggested increased responsiveness to an EGFR antibody
for the insertion exon 20 mutations, but not for T790M
exon 20 mutation.) The patient was treated with an
EGFR antibody-containing regimen and outcomes,
including tumor regression, ascertained using RECIST
measurements [34]. The results of a twenty patient trial
using a cetuximab-based regimen for lung cancer was
then retrospectively analyzed for patients with resistant
EGFR mutations [35]. The outcomes of the two patients
harboring such mutations (Table 2, Cases 1 and 3) were
evaluated. The study was performed consistent with the
Internal Review Board guidelines for the University
of California San Diego and University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center (depending on where they were
treated).
