BACKGROUND. Imatinib (IM) is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-Kit. c-Kit is
expressed in the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whereas
clinical trials evaluating monotherapy with IM in AML revealed low response rates,
Ara-C and IM showed synergistic effects in vitro. This suggested evaluation of a combination treatment.

METHODS. Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) combined with IM was tested to determine the efficacy and safety of this regimen. Forty patients from 4 centers with c-Kit-positive
AML (n ¼ 34) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) (n ¼ 6) with a median age of 73 years were enrolled. They were either not eligible for myelosuppressive
therapy and/or had recurring/refractory disease.
RESULTS. Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for analysis. In 6 of 38 patients a blast

cute myeloid leukemia (AML) shows an incidence of 17.6 per
100,000/year in patients 65 years of age or older compared with
1.8 per 100,000 per year in patients under the age of 65 years.1 More
than 50% of all AML cases affect patients over age 60.2 Besides
decreased tolerance to chemotherapy, different biology of the disease
(eg, higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetics and of antecedent
myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) and increased prevalence of
comorbidity contribute to a worse outcome in older patients with
complete response (CR) rates between of 38% to 62% compared with
a 73% CR rate in patients younger than 60 years.2–6 Additionally, longterm overall survival in adults over the age of 60 was shown to be dismal, with a range of only 5% to 15% in multicenter trials.2–4,7

Survival advantage for older patients achieving
remission upon myelosuppressive chemotherapy in
comparison to best supportive care or low-dose chemotherapy regimens (21 vs 11 weeks) has been demonstrated in 1 study.8 However, median survival in that
study was only 16 days longer than median time spent
in hospital for chemotherapy. Patients who choose myelosuppressive chemotherapy have been shown to spend
79% of their survival time in the hospital, whereas only
14% of patients receiving low-dose regimens or best
supportive care in an ambulatory setting became hospitalized.9 Thus, the role of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in this patient population is currently unclear.
c-Kit is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) closely related to other RTKs like vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor PDGFR.10 Binding of its ligand,
stem-cell factor (SCF), results in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of downstream pathways. cKit is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors, mast
cells, germ cells, and some human neoplasias.11,12 This
RTK has a major role in maintaining normal hematopoiesis, growth, and differentiation. Additionally, mutation
of c-Kit was found to cause ligand-independent receptor
activation and growth of tumor cells in a variety of neoplasias (eg, gastrointestinal stroma tumors [GIST] and
others).13,14 In AML, c-Kit was proposed to play a functional role. On AML blasts c-Kit expression was detected
in 63% to 80% of patients analyzed.15,16 Recently, the efficacy of small molecule RTK inhibitors to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk1/KDR (which has structural
and sequence similarity to c-Kit) was shown in vitro. Inhibition of this RTK led to decreased proliferation and
increased apoptosis. Additionally, SCF-induced phosphorylation of c-Kit was shown in AML blasts and
induction of apoptosis upon c-Kit TKI therapy could be
demonstrated.17 These results suggested that c-Kit inhibition might be a useful target in the treatment of AML.
Imatinib (IM; STI-571, Gleevec, Glivec) is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
and ATP analog with strong activity in Bcr-Abl-positive
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Additionally, IM inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases like PDGFRalpha
and beta as well as c-Kit.18,19 Besides its significant clinical activity in CML and Bcr/Abl, a positive acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) therapeutic benefit could be shown
in GIST with activating KIT or PDGFRa mutations.20–22
Two studies investigated the efficacy and safety of
imatinib as single-agent therapy in patients with c-Kit
positive AML or high-risk MDS. Eighteen patients were
treated in a Phase II study by Cortes et al.23 with 400 mg
IM daily. Twelve of them had refractory or recurring disease, whereas 6 of them were untreated. In all, 94%
showed a c-Kit positivity of >20% on AML blasts. None

of these patients showed any conventionally defined hematologic response on IM monotherapy; however, 2
patients experienced reductions in spleen size.23 Of 21
patients treated with 600 mg IM daily (all patients
showed c-Kit positivity >30%), 4 responded, with 2 CR,
1 partial response (PR), and 1 with no evidence of leukemia in the bone marrow. The median duration of the
response was 108 days.24 However, some of the
responses observed were derived from relatively small
reductions in leukemic blasts.24
Low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) is suggested to induce differentiation in AML and MDS and is often used as a palliative treatment approach for these indications. In a
meta-analysis a CR rate of 17% and a PR rate of 19%
with a median survival of 15 months has been shown.25
However, as a single agent LDAC does not improve overall survival in these patients in comparison to the best
supportive care.
IM and LDAC have demonstrated synergistic potential in patients with CML. Additionally, several groups
reported in vitro synergistic effects with these agents.26,27
For these reasons we conducted a multicenter Phase II
trial using IM and LDAC as a combination therapy in a
cohort of older patients who were not eligible for myelosuppressive chemotherapy and who received this study
medication in an ambulatory setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Target Population
Male and female AML and MDS patients older than age
18 who were not eligible for myelosuppressive chemotherapy or had recurring/refractory disease upon limited
pretreatment (ie, best supportive care only, biologic/
targeted agents, or <3 cycles standard chemotherapy) or
were diagnosed with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (CMML) were included.
Patients had to have a World Health Organization
(WHO) performance status between 0 and 2 and had to
be recovered from prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Treatment with hydroxyurea was allowed up to 24 hours
before Day 1 of study drug administration. At least 20%
CD117 positivity had to be detected in the blast population as determined by flow cytometry before administration of study medication.
Uncontrolled active infection, pregnancy, or breastfeeding were exclusion criteria. Patients had to be free of
marked liver or renal disease (as indicated by levels of
total bilirubin <2.0 times upper normal limit [UNL], serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] < 3.0 times UNL,
and serum creatinine <1.5 times UNL).
The study was performed in accordance with the
declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local

Low-Dose Ara-C and Imatinib in AML and HR-MDS/Heidel et al.

ethics committee. All patients gave written informed
consent according to the local guidelines.

Study Design
The study was designed as an international, multicenter,
single-arm Phase II study. According to the treatment
plan patients received oral doses of 600 mg IM daily and
10 mg of LDAC subcutaneously for 21 days every
28 days. Treatment was planned to be continued for a
maximum duration of 12 months. Hematologic and
nonhematologic toxicity was assessed according to the
National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health
(NCI/NIH) Common Toxicity Criteria.
Dose levels could be adapted for hematologic toxicity or non-sufficient antineoplastic effect to 6 different
additional dose levels (LDAC 15 mg/IM 800 mg; LDAC
10 mg/IM 800 mg; LDAC 7.5 mg/IM 600 mg; LDAC 7.5
mg/IM 400 mg; LDAC 7.5 mg/IM 300 mg; LDAC 5 mg/
IM 300 mg). Within the first 28 days of study medication
no dose reductions were planned. For grade 2–4 nonhematologic toxicity therapy was withheld until resolution
to grade <2. In patients with grade 3–4 liver toxicity
therapy had to be withheld immediately, with retesting
of liver enzymes and bilirubin within 1 week until resolution of all these parameters to grade 0–1. Treatment
toxicity was evaluated by patient interview and laboratory tests at each visit.
Patients who showed no significant antitumor effect
after 3 courses of therapy were taken off study. Concomitant administration of any other anticancer therapy
was prohibited. For marked leukocytosis leukapheresis
was possible. Subjects could receive antiinfective prophylaxis according to institutional practices. The use of
colony-stimulating factors was allowed. Because of the
inherent risk of either reduced activity or enhanced activity of the concomitant medication and/or IM, drugs
known to interact with the same CYP450 isoenzymes
(2D6 and 3A4) had to be used with caution as indicated
in the appendix of the protocol.
Efficacy Assessments
Patients were evaluated for response on day 28 of treatment or before the start of cycle 2, and then every
3 months by bone marrow biopsies if necessary and
peripheral blood (PB) evaluation. CR, PR, and hematologic improvement (HI) were considered as primary
efficacy parameters as recommended and defined
previously.2–4,24,28 Definition of HI was based on the
affected cell lines: erythroid response (baseline hemoglobin (HGB) <11 g/dL increasing by >2 g/dL or baseline red blood count (RBC) transfusion dependent
becoming independent), platelet response (baseline platelet count (PC) < 100 3 109/L increasing by >30 3 109/L
or baseline platelet transfusion dependent becoming

909

transfusion independent), and neutrophil response
(baseline ANC <1.5 3 109/L increasing by at least 100%
or an absolute increase >500 3 109/L, whichever is
greater).
Minor responses were described as blast response
(BR; reduction of blasts in peripheral blood >50% of
baseline) and stable disease (SD; absence of progression
for more than 2 months of therapy). Progressive disease
(PD) was defined as an increase of blasts in PB or bone
marrow (BM) >50% on therapy.

Study Dates
The final study protocol was completed in February
2004 according to recommendations of the ethics committee (Mainz, Germany) on January 29, 2004 (registration no. 837.469.03 (4131)). Start of the study was
February 18 2004 (inclusion of the first patient). The last
patient was included March 30 2005. Analysis of study
data was started in November 2005.
c-Kit Analysis
The percentage of c-Kit-positive blasts within the blast
gate was determined by FACS analysis using the antihuman CD117 (c-Kit; SCF receptor) monoclonal antibody with phycoerythrin conjugation (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).
Statistical Methods
The primary objective of this study was to assess efficacy in terms of the early mortality rate (EMR) (death
within 6 weeks of treatment) to the combination of
LDAC/IM in patients with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). Sample size and decision
criteria were chosen to reduce the expected accrual if
the treatment was ineffective.
The historical EMR for these patients is 25%.3,4 We
were interested in assessing the EMR for our new treatment. We thought that the EMR for our treatment would
be 15%. We accepted EMRs similar to the historical rate
because our treatment would be given on an outpatient
basis, and thus have lower resource utilization and
potentially higher quality of life.
The cohort analyzed in this study consisted of
patients who had received at least 1 dose of LDAC/IM and
for whom response status could be evaluated (intent-totreat population). Cancer-related symptoms and their severity were documented on the basis of frequency tables
on each visit. For statistical analysis GraphPad PRISM v.
4.0 (2003, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used.

RESULTS
Patients and Treatment
In total, 40 patients were treated according to the study

sion of almost only older patients. The median age was
73 years with a range of 42 to 82 years; 95% were at least
60 years of age and 16 (40%) were women. The majority
of patients (85%) had a diagnosis of AML, whereas 15%
had HR-MDS. Most of the patients included were restricted in physical strength with an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 1–2 (62.5%). Median
time from diagnosis to start of the combination therapy
with LDAC/IM was 22 days. Whereas 50% of patients
were previously untreated, 27.5% had received 1 line of
therapy and 22.5% had received 2 lines of treatment
before.
The majority of treatment time was conducted in
an ambulatory setting. The mean hospitalization time,
analyzed for patients treated at the University Hospital
Mainz (n ¼ 17), was 9.5 days (median, 5 days; range, 0–
31 days) with a mean treatment duration of 67.5 days

subcutaneously and 600 mg of IM orally daily. Dose
levels were adapted for hematologic toxicity as
described in Materials and Methods. Baseline characteristics of patients and treatment are depicted in Table 1.
Two out of the 40 patients were excluded from our analysis because of incorrect treatment schedule or inclusion criteria; 1 patient was evaluable incompletely due
to loss of follow-up. This patient was censored on the
last visit date.
After 1 month of treatment 34 (89.5%) patients, and
after 3 months of treatment 24 (63.2%) patients were
still evaluable for follow-up. Median follow-up was 130
days (mean follow-up, 160 days; range, 8–600 days).
Although the study was not restricted to older
patients only, the inclusion criteria (‘patients not eligible
for myelosuppressive therapy or HR-MDS’) led to inclu-

Clinical Responses and Biologic Activity
For analysis of efficacy 38 patients were evaluable. Six of
38 (16%) patients showed a blast response in peripheral
blood with a reduction >50% of peripheral blasts. Eight
of 38 of cases (21%) showed stable disease without progression for a minimum duration of 2 months.
The objective clinical response rate was low, 11% of
patients (Table 2). One (3%) patient each reached CR
and PR. These responders remained in remission for
253 days and 164 days, respectively. Two patients had
hematologic improvement. Whereas 1 patient showed
improvement of hematologic parameters for a period of
376 days without reaching PR, the other showed an isolated platelet response for a 195-day period. The median
progression free survival (PFS) was 41 days (Fig. 1), with
a maximum duration of 405. Three patients experienced
long-term progression-free survival of more than 250
days.

405 days.

Expression of c-Kit Receptors in BM and
Cytogenetic Analysis
In all, 32 patient samples were evaluable for analysis.
Median c-Kit positivity of blasts was 67% (range, 20–
100%). Cytogenetic analysis was available in 33 patients
with AML. Whereas the majority of analyzed samples
could be classified as intermediate risk (85%), additional
risk factors such as secondary AML or the presence of
an FLT3 ITD mutation were seen in 6 and 1 patients,
respectively.
No clear evidence for a correlation of CD117 positivity and cytogenetics with patient response was
obvious. Whereas 3 of the responders showed a high
percentage of c-Kit-positive blasts (75%–94%), 1 partial
responder revealed c-Kit expression of only 20% of
blasts.
Early and Long-Term Mortality
In this study early mortality was assessed after 6 weeks
of treatment as well as after 3 months. After the first
6 weeks of treatment the mortality rate was 18.9% (7 of
37 patients). After 3 months of treatment evaluation was
repeated and showed a 3-month mortality of 33.3%. At
the time of this analysis all of the patients had either
died of infectious complications or progressive disease.
The median overall survival (OS) was 138 days, with
20% of patients alive at the end of the observation period of 600 days (Fig. 2).
Safety Profile
As depicted in Table 3, 18 events were reported for
patients who experienced grade 3–4 neutropenia, 23
events for grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia, and 21 events
for grade 3–4 anemia. Most of the patients with grade 3–

were transfused with platelets (PLT < 20,000/lL) and
red cells (HGB < 8.0 g/dL) in an ambulatory setting.
Mild nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were

(n ¼ 9), fatigue (n ¼ 6), weight loss (n ¼ 6), and bleeding events (n ¼ 6) were the most common reported
events. Those mild AEs were reversible in the majority
of cases with supportive treatment. A severe form of
nausea was observed in 1 case with preexisting liver disease and refractory ascites. Three patients developed an
IM-associated grade 3 skin rash that was reversible after
discontinuation of imatinib medication. Patients did
not continue study medication and were taken off study
due to patients’ wish.
Other severe (grade 3–4) nonhematologic AEs (as
depicted in Table 4) were not suspected to be caused by
study medication. Grade 3–4 neutropenic fever and infectious complications were thought to be related to hematologic toxicity. None of the patients evaluable for
safety (n ¼ 39) experienced drug-related death. The majority of the patients died of progressive disease.

Cytarabine was administered by the patients and/or
related persons who were instructed in subcutaneous
injection. No adverse events were reported for drug
administration and handling of the injections was
reported to be safe.

DISCUSSION
This trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety
of a combination therapy of IM and LDAC. Prior investigations using IM as a single agent in AML have shown
inconsistent results,23,24 which might be due to different

dosing. Low tumor burden and start of IM in patients
reconstituting with blasts after myelosuppressive chemotherapy have been associated with response.
Regarding the safety of a combination therapy with
LDAC/IM, no major concerns became evident in drug
administration. Oral intake of IM was generally well tolerated and subcutaneous injection of cytarabine was
performed by the patients or with support of relatives.
The incidence of mild nausea/vomiting as well as episodes of pancytopenia observed were comparable to
symptoms of AML patients at the same age receiving
hydroxyurea, cytarabine, or best supportive care.
Objective response rates (ORRs) of this combination therapy were low in comparison to a myelosuppressive regimen. Whereas induction chemotherapy
achieves ORRs from 38% to 64%,2–4 even in patients
older than age 60, this LDAC/IM combination showed
an ORR of only 11%. In AML, response rates do not
always correlate with survival or quality of life. Only 5%
to 15% of older patients treated with myelosuppressive
chemotherapy show long-term disease-free survival.2,7
On 600 days of observation, 20% of patients who
received LDAC/IM therapy were still alive in this trial.
Interestingly, this figure for overall survival is very similar (OS less than 20% in 2 years) to results of a recent
ECOG Phase III trial employing several cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy.29
The early mortality rate of this combination therapy
at 6 weeks was 18.9%. This compares favorably to 25%
in large historical control groups of patients receiving
myelosuppressive chemotherapy.3,4 Thus, the LDAC/IM
regimen employed does not appear to be inferior
regarding short-term survival.
From another point of view, the LDAC/IM regimen
investigated here produced a slightly lower overall
remission rate as an LDAC monotherapy previously
described in the MRC14 trial.30 However, published follow-up information on PFS and OS from that trial is currently not available. This trial shows that LDAC in
combination with IM does not appear more effective
than LDAC alone. Overall, we believe this trial did not
use the appropriate selection criteria for evaluation of
IM therapy. Recently, it has been shown that IM has
antiproliferative activity in AML blasts selected for
t(8;21) and mutated/overexpressed c-KIT, whereas cells
from AML cases with neither t(8;21) nor c-KIT mutation/overexpression did not respond to IM.32 In this
trial, however, no selection was performed to include
patients with t(8;21) and mutated/overexpressed c-KIT.
Thus, this may explain why a combination of LDAC plus
IM was not more effective.
Patients had to have at least 20% c-Kit-positive
blasts to be eligible for this trial. However, the percentage of c-Kit-positive blasts did not correlate with clinical

response. Whereas 3 of the responders had expression
levels of 75% to 94% (1 CR, 2 HI), 1 patient with a partial
response showed 20% c-Kit-positive AML blasts. Therefore, the mechanisms of response and prediction of
response remain unclear. However, expression of c-Kit
as a sole marker for potential susceptibility to IM is
obviously insufficient. Only 1 of the previously performed studies using IM in the treatment of AML had
controlled for c-Kit mutations within known hot spot
regions (exons 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17).24 However, no mutations were found in this analysis, and the molecular basis for a response to IM in AML still needs to be
resolved.31
Inhibition of other kinases such as PDGFR could be
a possible mechanism.33 This hypothesis is supported by
the efficacy of IM reported in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome caused by FIP1L1-PDGFRa fusion.34,35
In our study no cytogenetic translocations involving
PDGF-receptor could be detected (Table 3). M-CSFreceptor (CSF-1R) is another member of the tyrosine
kinase-receptor class-III family that has recently been
reported to respond to treatment with IM.36 Downstream
signaling and M-CSF-receptor-dependent cell growth
was demonstrated to be sensitive to IM treatment. Additionally, mutant M-CSF-receptor cells (Asp-802) showed
resistance to IM treatment. Point mutations at other sites
have been shown to contribute to a growth advantage of
clonal cells.37 This member of the RTK III-family has not
been investigated for its role as a therapeutic target in
AML yet. Therefore, molecular analysis of other target kinases such as PDGFR and CSF-1R is warranted in future
analysis of AML patients. However, as complete clinical
remission rates have also been reported upon LDAC
monotherapy in 17% of cases,30 the true efficacy of IM in
addition to chemotherapy as a part of combination therapy will have to be tested in a randomized, controlled
Phase II trial. In this regard, in older AML patients (>60
years) the HOVON cooperative group has recently started
a randomized Phase II trial employing dose-reduced
induction and consolidation chemotherapy (‘5þ2’) with
and without IM followed by maintenance therapy with
IM versus observation (protocol HOVON 67).
For the majority of older AML patients, survival
advantage with myelosuppressive therapy is low.8 Selection of patients not eligible for myelosuppressive therapy is an important part of the initial assessment. AML
patients over age 60 have been reported to spend 79% of
their short survival time hospitalized. In contrast, in our
study the vast proportion of survival time was spent in
an ambulatory setting. Hospitalization rates were low,
with a mean hospitalization time of 9.5 days (range, 0–
31 days).
Only a small group of older AML patients may benefit from myelosuppressive induction chemotherapy by

913

achieving CR and long-term remissions. Identification
of prognostic factors for these 5% to 15% ‘responders’
could result in higher cure rates due to therapy intensification in a small group, whereas the majority of older
AML patients could receive ongoing treatment in a palliative setting with the goal of high quality of life. Older
AML patients who show additional risk factors for myelosuppressive therapy are ideal candidates for clinical
trials employing novel agents versus best supportive
care. It is reasonable to assume that relevant risk factors
include disease-related characteristics such as poor risk
cytogenetics, high leukocyte count at diagnosis, secondary AML, or significant comorbidities like cardiac failure
or renal insufficiency. In this group the risk of early mortality and long-term hospitalization prevail over the
minimal chance of cure (<5%). For these patients, novel
agents including TKIs, histone-deacetylase-, or heat
shock protein-inhibitors with or without concomitant
dose-reduced chemotherapy are attractive candidates
to be tested in future trials.
