ABSTRACT
Galiellalactone (GL) is a fungal metabolite that presents antitumor activities on
prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. In this study we show that GL induced cell cycle
arrest in G2/M phase, caspase-dependent apoptosis and also affected the microtubule
organization and migration ability in DU145 cells. GL did not induce double strand
DNA break but activated the ATR and ATM-mediated DNA damage response (DDR)
inducing CHK1, H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) and CDC25C downregulation.
Inhibition of the ATM/ATR activation with caffeine reverted GL-induced G2/M cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage measured by γH2AX. In contrast, UCN-01, a CHK1
inhibitor, prevented GL-induced cell cycle arrest but enhanced apoptosis in DU145
cells. Furthermore, we found that GL did not increase the levels of intracellular ROS,
but the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) completely prevented the effects of GL on
γH2AX, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In contrast to NAC, other antioxidants
such as ambroxol and EGCG did not interfere with the activity of GL on cell cycle. GL
significantly suppressed DU145 xenograft growth in vivo and induced the expression
of γH2AX in the tumors. These findings identify for the first time that GL activates
DDR in prostate cancer.

inflammation, cell growth and differentiation. However,
constitutive activation of STAT3 has been observed
in many tumor types, including prostate cancer [6–9].
STAT3 regulates the expression of cell-cycle regulators,
angiogenic factors and anti-apoptotic genes, promoting
tumorigenesis [10].
Microtubules are essential components of the
cytoskeleton and play a key role in division, growth
and migration functions. Microtubule inhibitors (vinca
alkaloids) or microtubule stabilizers (taxanes) have
been among the most active chemotherapeutic drugs in
treating human cancer [11]. Several studies have linked
cytoplasmatic STAT3 with cytoskeletal structures. For
example, cytoplasmatic STAT3 may modulate microtubule
dynamics and cell migration through a direct interaction
with stathmin protein that is a tubuling-binding protein
involved in the control of microtubule assembly and
dynamics. [12, 13]. Also, STAT3 inhibition decreases

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second most common
diagnosed cancer in men worldwide and the first in
developed countries. It has been estimated that 1.1
million new cases have occurred in 2012 [1]. Initially,
prostate cancer depends on androgens for growth, and
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective in the
early stages of the disease. However, 18-24 months later,
the majority of patients does not respond to ADT and
develop a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),
which is associated with a poor prognosis, and mean
survival [2–5].
STAT3 belongs to the signal transducers
and activators of transcription (STATs) family of
transcription factors. STAT3 is activated in response
to several growth factors and cytokines and is
involved in numerous physiological processes such as

the migration of ovarian cancer cells and keratinocytes
[14, 15]. Altogether, this suggests that inhibiting STAT3
activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy for
cancer [16].
Galiellalactone (GL) is a fungal metabolite with
potent antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects, isolated
from Galiella rufa and it has also been produced
synthetically [17]. GL is a direct inhibitor of STAT3
that prevents the binding of the activated STAT3
dimers to DNA binding sites without affecting tyrosine
phosphorylation [18, 19]. GL is cytotoxic and induces
apoptosis in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell
lines and in prostate cancer stem cell-like cells. GL also
inhibits tumor growth and early metastatic dissemination
of prostate cancer in mice [20–22]. In addition, it has
been demonstrated that GL inhibits NF-κB and TGF-β
signaling, preventing the association of p65 with the
importin α3 and inhibiting the binding of the activated
Smad2/3 transcription factor to DNA, respectively [23,
24]. Also, GL improves experimental allergic asthma and
it has an anti-thrombotic effect in murine models [25, 26].
In normal cells, the cell division cycle and apoptosis
are tightly controlled, while cancer cells are characterized
by deregulation in these processes [27, 28]. Checkpoints
are the most important machinery involved in the control
of the cell cycle. In response to genotoxic stress, DNA
damage response (DDR) signaling pathway is activated,
causing cell cycle arrest to allow the correction of the
damage and to maintain genomic integrity. Checkpoints
together with DNA repairing mechanisms and apoptosis
are integrated in a circuitry that determines the ultimate
response of a cell to DNA damage [29]. DNA damage is
detected by MNR (MRE11, NBS1 and Rad50 proteins)
and RPA (Human replication protein A) complexes act as
sensors and recruit ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
and ataxia-telangiectasia and RAD3 related (ATR) to the
site of the lesion, resulting in increased phosphorylation
of histone H2AX (γH2AX), which is a marker of DNA
damage. Activated ATM/ATR triggers phosphorylation
of its downstream targets p53, CHK1 and CHK2, which
in turn inhibit CDC25 phosphatases, preventing the
activation of CDK1/Cyclin B and leading to G2/M arrest
and initiation of DNA repair [30, 31]. Widely used drugs
in cancer chemotherapy such as etoposide, cisplatin
or doxorubicin are inducers of DNA damage pathway
[32–34]. Therefore, the search for new effective drugs
whose therapeutic target is ATM/ATR signaling may be a
promising approach for CRPC treatment.
Natural products that induce cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis have been an interesting source for the discovery
of new therapeutic agents against cancer, including CRPC
[35–37]. Our results provide first evidence that GL
induces microtubules destabilization, DNA damage, G2/M
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activation of the
ATM/ATR pathway in the androgen-insensitive DU145
cells. Moreover, GL was able to induce the expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of γH2AX in DU145 xenograft tumors and therefore its
antitumor effects may be due to the activation of DNA
damage pathway by the same mechanism that occurs
in vitro.

RESULTS
Galiellalactone induces cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in DU145 cells
Since GL inhibits both STAT3 and NF-κB
transcriptional activities, and both transcription factors
participated in the progression of cell cycle in cancer cells
[6, 38, 39], we were interested in studying the effect of
GL on the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells. DU145 cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of GL for 6,
12 and 24 h and the percentage of cells in the different
phases of cell cycle identified by FACS analysis. We show
in Figure 1A and 1B that GL induced a dose-dependent
cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase that was more evident
after 24 h of treatment in DU145 cells. Similar results
were obtained in other human cancer cells like Jurkat or
SK-N-SH (data not shown), and human prostate cancer
cell line PC3 (Supplementary Figure 1). The different p53
expression between the cell lines analyzed (p53 wild-type
and null) indicated that GL induces G2/M phase cell cycle
arrest independent of p53. In the same sense, PC3 cells
(p53 null) transfected to express p53 wild-type showed
analogous effects in response to GL (Supplementary Figure
1). In contrast, GL did not induce cell cycle arrest either in
primary fibroblasts or in non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 cells
that are derived from prostate epithelium (Figure 1C).
Previous reports have shown that GL induces
apoptosis in DU145 cells through a caspase-3 dependent
pathway [20]. Thus, we investigated whether cell cycle
arrest paralleled with caspase-3 activation and apoptosis.
DU145 cells were pre-incubated with the cell-permeant
pan caspase inhibitor Z-Vad-FMK and treated with GL.
We found that GL induced the activation and cleavage of
caspase-3 that preceded the membrane translocation of
phosphatidyl-serine measured by Anexin-V staining and
both activities were completely inhibited in the presence
of Z-Vad-FMK (Figures 2A and 2B). On the contrary, pan
caspase inhibitor did not prevent GL-induced G2/M phase
cell cycle arrest (Figure 2C). These results indicate that
GL affects different signaling pathways in DU145 cells,
leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Galiellalactone destabilizes microtubules and
inhibits cell migration in DU145 cells
Actin and tubulins are abundant cytoskeletal proteins
that support diverse cellular processes including cell cycle
progression. To investigate the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of GL effects on cell shape, we evaluated
cell morphology using confocal microscopy, comparing

the effects induced by cytochalasin D, a blocker of actin
polymerization and elongation of actin, with those induced
by nocodazole and docetaxel, two antineoplasic agents
that interfere microtubules polymerization.
We found that after 6 h GL produces a change in
morphology, clearly reducing cell size to that observed
in DU145 cells arrested in mitosis. Also, GL treatment
does not cause aggregation of actin as observed after

cytochalasin D treatment. However, GL was able to
produce a similar microtubule destabilization observed
with microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) docetaxel and
nocodazole (Figure 3A). MTAs but not GL induced an
increase in the percentage of subdiploid cells (sub G0/G1)
that corresponds to apoptotic cells after 24 h treatment,
indicating that the action mechanism of MTAs and GL
should be different (Figure 3B). Accordingly, subdiploid

cells in GL-treated DU145 cells are detected only after 48
h treatment (data not shown).
In order to evaluate if GL causes cell cycle arrest
through de novo protein and RNA synthesis we used the
transcriptional inhibitor mitomycin C. In the combined
treatment we observed that cell cycle arrest produced
by GL at 24 h was reversed with mitomycin C in DU145
cells, indicating that cell cycle arrest at G2/M produced
by GL requires de novo transcription of genes involved in
cell cycle checkpoints regulation (Figure 4A). Recently, it
has been shown that GL inhibits invasion in DU145 cells
[22]. This finding, together with the effect on microtubules
stabilization shown above, has led us to investigate the
effects of GL on migration process by wound healing assay.
We found that GL clearly impaired wound healing in DU145
cells compared to untreated cells (Figures 4B and 4C).

Next, to examine the capacity of GL to induce
activation of DNA damage sensor kinases ATM/
ATR, DU145 cells were stimulated with GL and ATM
Ser1981 and ATR Ser428 phosphorylation detected
by immunoblotting. In parallel, we evaluated Ser139
phosphorylation of histone H2A variant H2AX as marker
of DNA damage. As shown in Figure 5C, GL induced ATM
and ATR phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner,
affecting Ser139 phosphorylation levels of H2AX, with
similar results were found in PC3 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2). Finally, we performed a Comet-assay to
determine DNA strand breaks (Figure 5D). In contrast
to the analysis of γH2AX, no significant changes were
observed in the cells stimulated with GL. By contrast, a
dramatic Comet formation was observed under etoposide
stimulation. These results demonstrate that GL mediates
the activation of ATM/ATR signaling pathway without
DNA double strand break.

GL activates ATM/ATR signaling pathway
without induce massive DNA damage

Inhibition of ATM/ATR signaling pathway
rescues GL-mediated G2/M phase cell-cycle
arrest

To examine the molecular basis by which GL
induces G2/M cell cycle arrest we firstly analyzed the
expression of key proteins involved in cycle progression
and checkpoint response. DU145 cells were stimulated
with GL and the expression kinetic of the indicated
proteins was analyzed. As shown in Figure 5A, the protein
levels of pCDC25C (Ser216), CDC25C and pWee1
(Ser642) were clearly down-regulated in a time-dependent
manner in response to GL treatment. By contrast, other
proteins such as Cyclin B1, pHistone H3 (Ser10) or p21
were up-regulated. No significant change was observed in
pCDK1 (Tyr15) and Myt1 expression levels, while Myt1
hyperphosphorylation was clearly detected after 12 h of
treatment. In summary, these results clearly indicate that
GL may induce cell cycle arrest through the control of the
expression of key proteins involved in the regulation of S
and G2/M phases.
CDC25C is an essential protein for the control of
the G2/M cell cycle transition, and also a key component
of the checkpoint pathways that become activated in
response to DNA damage or environmental insults.
Under this stress situation, ATM and ATR kinases
and their downstream checkpoint kinases CHK1 and
CHK2, mediate the inhibition and/or degradation of
CDC25C. Based on the ability of GL to mediate CDC25C
degradation, we decided to analyze whether GL may
activate the ATM/ATR pathway. To study this possibility,
we first monitored CHK1 and CHK2 activation levels
by analyzing the phosphorylation at Ser345 and Thr68,
respectively. We show in Figure 5B that GL treatment led
to CHK1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner,
not affecting the phosphorylation levels of CHK2. CHK1
activation correlated with phosphorylation of CDC25C at
the Ser216 site and posterior degradation. Similar results
were obtained in PC3 cells (Supplementary Figure 2).
These results indicate that GL-mediated down-regulation
of CDC25C paralleled with CHK1 activation.

In view of these results, we next examined the effect
of ATM/ATR inhibitors on GL-mediated G2/M cell cycle
arrest, DDR signaling pathway and apoptosis. DU145
cells were stimulated with GL in the presence or absence
of the CHK1/CHK2 dual inhibitor UCN-01, and cell cycle
and the expression of pCHK1 (Ser345), γH2AX and PARP
proteins evaluated in parallel. We found that inhibition of
CHK1 prevented GL-mediated G2/M phase cell-cycle
arrest (Figure 6A), but it did not interfere with GL-induced
PARP cleavage (Figure 6B) and apoptosis, which was
particularly increased (Figure 6C). Finally, and to further
verify the role of ATM/ATR in GL-mediated G2/M cell
cycle arrest, we performed similar experiments using the
ATM/ATR inhibitor caffeine. DU145 cells stimulated
with GL, in the absence or presence of caffeine, showed
that ATM/ATR inhibition clearly rescued GL-mediated
G2/M cell cycle arrest (Figure 6D), and prevented ATR,
ATM and H2AX activation (Figure 6E). In contrast to the
results obtained with CHK1/CHK2 inhibition, caffeine
produced a significant reduction in GL-induced PARP
cleavage and apoptosis (Figure 6F). Similarly, caffeine
stimulation reverted GL capacity to impair wound healing
in DU145 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Altogether
these data demonstrate that GL-mediated G2/M cell cycle
arrest is mediated by activation of the ATM/ATR signaling
pathway.

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) suppresses cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis produced by GL
The DDR cascade and ROS (reactive oxygen
species) signaling are both involved in the induction of
cell death after DNA damage. Thus, we were interested
in investigating whether an increase of intracellular ROS

was involved in GL-induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in DU145 cells. We show in Figure 7A
that, in contrast to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), GL
was not able to increase the levels of intracellular ROS.
Accordingly, neither the antioxidants ambroxol nor
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) prevented GL-induced
G2/M cell cycle arrest (Figure 7B). Interestingly, N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) treatment prevented the effect of GL on
G2/M cell cycle arrest (Figure 7B), PARP cleavage, H2AX
phosphorylation (Figure 7C) and apoptosis (Figure 7D).
NAC is a scavenger of oxygen free radicals and a
precursor of L-cysteine. GL has the ability to modify and
covalently bind to cysteines, at least in the STAT3 protein,
and therefore it is possible that NAC could bind GL
attenuating its apoptotic effects.

Previous studies have demonstrated that GL
produces a decrease tumor growth in several animal
models of prostate cancer [20, 22]. Therefore, next we
were interested in studying DDR after GL treatment
in vivo. DU145 cell xenograft mouse model received
a dose of 3 mg/kg through i.p injections every day
for 21 days. Our results demonstrated that GL did not
affect body weight of mice (Figure 8A). By contrast, a
significant reduction of the volume tumor was observed
during the treatment (Figure 8B) and the tumor
weight was also significantly decreased after 21 days
of GL treatment in comparison with untreated group

pathway caused by GL we determined the expression of
phosphorylated H2AX. Immunohistochemistry analysis
of tissue sections showed that γH2AX positive cells

expression was significantly higher in mice treated with
GL in comparison with untreated mice (Figure 8D). These
results confirm that activation of DNA damage signaling
occurs in vitro and also in vivo.

DISCUSSION

that suppresses the DDR by interrupting ATR-CHK1
signaling [41]. Moreover, STAT3 is required for efficient
repair of damaged DNA following UVB irradiation and
STAT3 deficient cells have reduced activity of ATMCHK1 pathway [42]. Also, it has been well-established
that cytotoxic drugs and ionizing radiation activate
NF-κB [40] involved in DNA repair mechanisms [43].
Therefore, NF-κB inhibitors administered in combination
with cytostatic drugs enhanced the cytotoxicity activities
of these treatments favoring pro-apoptotic cascade [44].

STAT3 and NF-κB have been identified to be
involved in the processes of cell proliferation, cell
differentiation and cell survival and, therefore, play
an important role in tumorigenesis. In addition, it has
been described that constitutive activation of these
transcription factors contributes to chemoresistance in
multiple malignancies [40]. On the other hand, it has
been shown that EBV infection induces STAT3 activation

It has been previously shown that GL is a dual
NF-κB /STAT3 inhibitor, but nothing is known about its
effects on cell cycle and DDR signaling in cancer cells.
In this study, our results demonstrate that GL was able to
induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in human prostate
cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3), with similar results

in other cancer cell lines like Jurkat and SK-N-SH (data
not shown). Similarly, GL induces apoptosis in androgeninsensitive prostate cancer cells through activation of
ATM/ATR-CHK1 signaling without inducing DNA break.
Thus, GL may exert antitumoral activity at different levels:
inhibiting the action of the pro-survival transcription

factors STAT3/ NF-κB, inducing DNA damage signaling
pathway and inhibiting DNA repairing mechanism
(Figure 9). However, further studies are required to confirm
that G2/M cell cycle arrest and activation of ATM/ATRsignaling depend on these transcription factors.
Previous studies have shown that GL produces
caspase-3 dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
[20, 21]. Treatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan caspase
inhibitor, prevented apoptosis, corroborating previous
results, although cell cycle arrest was maintained at G2/M
in DU145 cells. These results demonstrate that a repair
process is activated after GL in spite of blocking apoptosis

cell death, showing that they are processes with different
signaling pathways.
In some cases, such as after treatment with docetaxel
or cytochalasin D, cell cycle arrest is accompanied
by cytoskeleton disorganization at actin/tubulin levels
[45–47]. Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) arrest
mitosis and in turn cell death. Recently, an study have
proposed that, instead of mitotic arrest, disrupting
intracellular trafficking of DNA repair proteins (ATM,
ATR, DNA-PK, Rad50, Mre11, p95/NBS1, p53, 53BP1
and p63) is responsible of MTAs action mechanisms, such
as vincristine or paclitaxel. Also, the treatment with these

MTAs results in higher and sustained γ H2AX levels in
A549 and MCF7 cells treated with radiation or etoposide.
For this reason, the combination of MTAs plus DNA
damaging agents enhances their effect separately [48].
Our results show that GL treatment provokes microtubule
alteration at early stages in DU145 cells and thus might be
hindering the transport of proteins involved in repairing
the process, promoting cell arrest in G2/M and apoptosis.
Besides the ability to inhibit NF-κB/STAT3, we
show that GL may target cancer cell progression by
the activation of ATM/ATR pathway, inducing a rapid
CDC25C degradation in DU145 cells. CDC25C protein
stability is regulated by DDR kinases ATM/ATR-CHK1/
CHK2. We identified that GL activates DDR in DU145
cells through ATR and ATM phosphorylation, which
increases CHK1 phosphorylation at Ser345 but not
phosphorylation of CHK2 at Thr68. Depending on the
cellular context and DNA damage agents, ATM and ATR
or both kinases may be activated. For example, whereas
VP-16 provokes ATR activation [49], camptothecin

activates either ATM or ATR in DNA damage events in
different cancer cell lines [50]. The critical role of ATM/
ATR-CHK1 in the regulation of GL-mediated degradation
of CDC25C was confirmed by the inhibition of the ATM/
ATR-CHK1 checkpoint control pathway using caffeine
and the CHK1 inhibitor UCN-01.
ATM/ATR pathway is activated mainly in response
to different types of DNA damage. Although we observed
an increase in γH2AX levels in GL treated DU145 cells
and animal models, GL did not induce massive DNA
DSBs as compared with etoposide in comet assays. One
possibility is that GL could be causing another type
of DNA damage similar to that caused by alkylating
agents, transferring methyl or ethyl group to a DNA
base. The capacity of GL to covalently bind to cysteine
could block the active cysteine site of O6-methylguanine
methyltransferase (MGMT), inhibiting this protein
and therefore preventing this DNA repair mechanism,
activating DNA response signaling. DNA alkylating
agents such as temozolomide, carmustine and estramustine

activation of pATM/ATR, which phosphorylates H2AX and CHK1 to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by CDC25C inhibition.
Activation of pATM/ATR also induces apoptosis through a CHK1-independent pathway.

are used in cancer therapy [51]. On the other hand, it
has been reported that oxidative stress can also activate
ATM by a mechanism independent of DNA DSBs [52].
In this sense, we show that GL does not produce ROS in
DU145 cells but their effects on cell cycle and apoptosis
were blocked with NAC treatment. NAC is an aminothiol
used as an antioxidant, but it is also a synthetic precursor
of GSH and intracellular cysteine, and can interact with
proteins presenting cysteine residues or thiol groups [53,
54]. In this context, a previous study showed that GL is a
cysteine reactive inhibitor that covalently binds to cysteine
in STAT3 inhibiting its binding to DNA. Therefore, while
NAC could block the reactive site of GL, we cannot
exclude oxidative stress to be involved in GL-mediated
activation of ATM/ATR pathway.
In summary, this study reports for the first time a new
mechanism of action for GL, with important consequences
on the damage response pathway in the context of its
antitumor activities on prostate cancer. We demonstrate how
fungal GL induces DDR via ATM/ATR-CHK1 pathway,
causing apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in prostate
cancer (Figure 9), inhibiting tumor growth in vivo in mouse
tumor models. These findings validate GL as a promising
antitumor agent for treatment of castration-resistant prostate
cancer, alone or in combination with other drugs.

FACS analysis
For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% cold
ethanol at -20ºC overnight. After that cells were washed
with PBS once and then stained with 1 mg/mL propidium
iodide (PI) and treated with RNase A (50 U/mL) for 2 h
at 37ºC in darkness. For apoptosis studies, cells were
harvested and washed in cold PBS and then resuspended
in binding buffer consisting of 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM
NaCl and 2.5 mM CaCl2 pH 7.4. Cells were stained with
Annexin V, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes
by life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and propidium
iodide. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were
determined by BD FACSCanto™ flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) using BD FACSDiva™
software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
DU145, PC3 and RWPE-1 cells were from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). DU145 and PC3 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. RWPE-1
cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum free medium
supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (0.05 mg/ml)
and human recombinant epidermal growth factor (5 ng/
ml). Human normal dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs) were
purchased to Innoprot (Bizkaia, Spain) and cultured in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% of FBS and
antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37ºC in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cell lines were routinely
tested to be free of mycoplasma and cross contamination.
DU145 validation was performed by a multiplex PCR
with Geneprint10 System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
following the manufacturer's manual. Galiellalactone
was isolated as previously described [55] or purchased
from US Biological Life Sciences (Salem, MA, USA).
Mitomycin C and Z-VAD-FMK were obtained from Enzo
Life Technologies (Farmingdale, NY, USA). Antibodies

Western blotting
Whole cell extracts were obtained by lysing the cells
in NP-40 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol and 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysate concentrations were
determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated
by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes and
blocked with PBS-T (Phosphate-buffered saline and
0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for
1 h at room temperature (RT). Incubation with primary
antibodies was performed overnight at 4ºC, followed by
incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody. The washed membranes
were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies
coupled to horseradish peroxidase that were detected by
an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (ECL).

Immunofluorescence
DU145 cells were grown on coverslips and after
treatment fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and
4502

permeabilized in 0.12% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After
that, cells were stained for 1 h at room temperature
with Phalloidin-TRITC 10 μg/mL and anti-α-Tubulin
(T9026) for staining of actin filaments and microtubules,
respectively, and counterstained with Alexa Fluor 488
goat-anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Coverslides
were mounted in Vectashield mounting media with
DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA,
USA) and examined with an LSM 5 EXCITER (Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) confocal laser-scanning
microscope using a 63×/1.40 oil objective (PlanApochromat), and ZEN 2008 software (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging GmbH).

Six-week-old male athymic nude-Foxn1nu mice
(Harlan Laboratories, Barcelona, Spain) were kept on
a 12 h light-dark cycle, temperature 20ºC (±2ºC) and
40-50% relative humidity with free access to standard
food and water. Experimental procedure was performed
in accordance with European Union and the Córdoba
University ethical committee guidelines (2014PI/015).
A total of 10 mice were injected subcutaneously into the
flank with 3x106 DU145 cells and tumors were established
4 weeks after injection. Then, mice were divided into
2 groups: Group 1 (n=5) received vehicle (1% DMSO in
PBS) and group 2 (n=5) were treated with 3 mg/kg of GL
by intraperitoneal injection (i.p) every day for 3 weeks in
both cases. Tumor volume was measured every 3-4 days
using a caliper and calculated by the formula length (mm)
x width x height x 0.5632. After treatment, mice were
sacrificed and tumours were extracted, weighted, fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin.
Sections (5 μM thickness) of each tumour were prepared
for immunohistochemistry analysis.

Measurement of ROS levels
Cells were stimulated with either GL or tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (TBHP) (0.4 mM). After 3 h of incubation,
cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 1 μM of
2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA; Molecular
Probes, OR, USA) for 20 min at 37ºC in darkness.
Fluorescence was measured at 450 nm excitation and
535 nm emission using a TECAN GENios Pro (Tecan
Group Ltd, Switzerland).

Immunohistochemistry
The sections of xenograft tumor samples were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded
ethanol series ending in water. Antigen retrieval was done
by heating in sodium citrate 10 mM pH 6 at 98ºC for
10 min and then incubated in methanol and 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. Non-specific binding was blocked with IHC Select
Blocking Reagent (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
at room temperature for 30 min followed by incubation
with the phospho-histone H2AX (Ser139) primary antibody
at 4ºC overnight. After that, samples were incubated with
secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit (Merck Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) at room temperature for 4  h.
Incubation with the IHC Select Streptavidin-HRP reagent
was performed at room temperature for 30 min, before
the chromogen was developed using diaminobenzidine
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Merck
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). A Leica DM2500
microscope and a Leica DFC420c camera were used for
slide observation and photography and all image processing
was done using ImageJ (Bethesda. MD, USA).

Wound healing assay
DU145 cells were seeded on 96-well plates
(ImageLock plate, Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA) at a 5 × 104 cell density and were allowed to attach
overnight. When cells reached confluence, a wound was
scratched across each well using Wound Maker device
(Essen Bioscience) and detached cells were removed by
gentle washing with PBS. Then, cells were treated or not
with GL in the presence of mitomycin C (5 μg/ml). Images
have a blue mask showing the initial wound boundaries
at 0 h and wound closure was monitored hourly for 24 h
and quantified as wound confluence (%) with IncuCyte
ZOOM Live-Cell Imaging System (Essen Bioscience,
Hertfordshire, UK).

Comet assay
Cells (4 × 105) were seeded into 6-well plates and
treated with GL or etoposide for 24 h. DNA damage
was detected using an OxiSelect™ Comet Assay kit
(Cell Biolabs Inc, San Diego, USA) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were harvested
and mixed with low melt agarose on the OxiSelect Comet
Slide. Then, the embedded cells were lysed and treated
with alkaline solution to denature DNA. After that,
electrophoresis was carried out under alkaline conditions
at 1 V/cm and 300 mA for 30 min and the samples stained
with Vista Green fluorescence dye for 15 min in darkness,
analysed using a Leica DM2500 fluorescent microscope
and quantified by Casp software (CASPlab, Wroclaw,
Poland).
