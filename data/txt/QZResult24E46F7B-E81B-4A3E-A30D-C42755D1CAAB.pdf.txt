ABSTRACT
AAA-ATPase TRIP13 is one of the chromosome instability gene recently established
in multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common and incurable hematological
malignancy. However, the specific function of TRIP13 in MM is largely unknown. Using
sequential gene expression profiling, we demonstrated that high TRIP13 expression
levels were positively correlated with progression, disease relapse, and poor prognosis
in MM patients. Overexpressing human TRIP13 in myeloma cells prompted cell growth
and drug resistance, and overexpressing murine TRIP13, which shares 93% sequence
identity with human TRIP13, led to colony formation of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in vitro
and tumor formation in vivo. Meanwhile, the knockdown of TRIP13 inhibited myeloma
cell growth, induced cell apoptosis, and reduced tumor burden in xenograft MM mice.
Mechanistically, we observed that the overexpression of TRIP13 abrogated the spindle
checkpoint and induced proteasome-mediated degradation of MAD2 primarily through the
Akt pathway. Thus, our results demonstrate that TRIP13 may serve as a biomarker for
MM disease development and prognosis, making it a potential target for future therapies.

leading to chromosomal instability (CIN) [1]. CIN has also
been correlated with acquired or intrinsic drug resistance
[2]. In addition, cellular mechanisms that normally enforce
aneuploidy have been clarified in terms of defects in spindle
checkpoints [3]. The kinetochore, a specialized protein/
DNA-containing structure located at the centromere of each
chromosome, keeps the paired sister chromatids together and
tensioned by attaching to the mitotic spindles, which will
pull the sister chromatids apart upon the onset of anaphase
during mitosis [3]. Spindle checkpoint proteins associated
with the kinetochore will arrest the mitotic program

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM), a clonal neoplasm
characterized by the expansion of malignant plasma cells in
the bone marrow, is the second most common hematological
malignancy worldwide. Despite the development of novel
treatment agents, MM remains incurable for the majority of
patients owing to drug resistance, which has prompted the
need to identify novel therapeutic strategies.
As a heterogeneous disease, MM is typified by almost
universal aneuploidy and recurrent chromosomal aberrations,

when sensing the lack of attachment and/or tension at the
kinetochores, and this is part of a surveillance mechanism.
These checkpoint proteins will swiftly become inactivated
once all chromosomes are properly positioned. The role
of spindle checkpoints is to maintain proper chromosome
segregation and genetic stability by delaying metaphaseanaphase transition during cell division in the presence of
defective kinetochore-microtubule attachment [4]. However,
dysfunctions of checkpoint proteins allow cells to go through
mitosis (transition from metaphase to anaphase) prematurely,
resulting in chromosomal mis-segregation and aneuploidy in
cancer-prone daughter cells [3].
Recently, we have characterized 10 CIN genes that
are strongly correlated with MM drug resistance and
disease relapse. Thyroid hormone receptor-interacting
protein 13 (TRIP13), an AAA-ATPase, is one of these
10 CIN genes, which are significantly up-regulated in
MM, especially in high-risk MM [5]. Also, according
to gene expression profile (GEP) data, TRIP13 has been
demonstrated to be one of the most important genes in the
70-gene high risk model of MM [6, 7]. However, GEPbased signature has limited power to predict therapeutic
response in MM patients [8], highlighting the need to
validate and specify the exact role of target genes in vitro
and in vivo. Generally, TRIP13 is required for chromosome
structure and recombination during mitosis [9], and is also
a mitotic checkpoint-silencing protein [4], suggesting its
regulatory effects on checkpoint proteins and its potential
role in promoting cancers. Banerjee et al. have recently
discovered that TRIP13-mediated drug resistance in
squamous cell head and neck carcinoma occurs via
enhanced double strand break (DSB) DNA repair through
nonhomologous end joining signaling, which repairs the
DSBs through the whole cell cycling [10]. However, the
exact function of TRIP13 in the pathogenesis of MM has
not been investigated yet.
In this study, we compare the TRIP13 expression in
newly diagnosed and relapsed MM samples and correlate
the TRIP13 expression with patient outcomes. We evaluate
TRIP13 functions in MM cell growth, drug resistance and
tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we
determine that TRIP13 impairs checkpoint surveillance
and identify a novel pathway that induces proteasomemediated MAD2 degradation and drug resistance in
MM. These data will help elucidate novel mechanisms
responsible for tumorigenesis and treatment failure in MM
and provide a potential new target in MM therapy.

plus 2.0 microarray were identified specific to TRIP13
isoform 1, which has a longer C-terminus compared with
isoform 2. Therefore, we focused on TRIP13 isoform 1
and its function in this study. We firstly compared TRIP13
expression levels in CD138-enriched plasma cells from
22 healthy subjects (normal plasma cells, NPC), 44
subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS) and 351 patients with newly
diagnosed MM. We did not see expression difference
between NPC and MGUS (p=0.65), however, TRIP13 was
significantly increased in newly diagnosed MM patients
compared to NPC and MGUS samples (p<0.01) (Figure
1A). We also compared TRIP13 expression from 51 paired
MM samples obtained at baseline (BL) and at relapse (RL)
using GEP in total therapy 2 (TT2) and total therapy 3
(TT3). TRIP13 was significantly increased in relapsed
MM samples compared to those collected at diagnosis
(p < 0.01 in TT2, p < 0.05 in TT3) (Figure 1B). Next,
we correlated the gene expression of TRIP13 with patient
outcomes. We performed log-rank tests and presented with
Kaplan-Meier survival curves between high (quartile 4)
and low (quartiles 1 ~ 3) samples from the TT2 and TT3
cohorts, which included 351 and 208 GEPs respectively.
Results demonstrated that patients with high TRIP13 had
inferior overall survival (OS) in both TT2 and TT3 trials
(Figure 1C; p < 0.001 in TT2, p < 0.05 in TT3). From
another perspective, when patients in each cohort were
divided into 10 equal-sized groups on the basis of the
ranked expression levels of TRIP13 (on the x-axis from
left to right), the proportion of patients with either MM
events or death was generally positively correlated to the
expression levels of TRIP13 (Figure 1D).

Overexpression of TRIP13 induces myeloma cell
growth and drug resistance
To evaluate the functional role of TRIP13 in
myeloma pathogenesis, we overexpressed TRIP13 in
the MM cell lines ARP1, OCI-MY5, and H929 using
lentivirus-mediated human TRIP13-cDNA (Figure 2A).
The cell number in all three TRIP13-overexpressing (OE)
cell lines significantly increased after 3-day cultures,
indicating that high levels of TRIP13 promote MM cell
growth (Figure 2B, p < 0.05).
To explore the effects of TRIP13 on drug resistance
in MM, TRIP13-OE MM cell line ARP1 and OCIMy5 or empty vector-transfected cells were treated
with different concentrations of anticancer reagents:
proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib or topoisomerase
inhibitor etoposide. Cell viability assay was performed
24 hours later using the PrestoBlue Cell Viability reagent.
We observed that the number of viable cells in TRIP13OE ARP1 and OCI-My5 cells was significantly higher
after drug treatment compared with empty vector control
cells (Figure 2C and 2D, p < 0.05). To examine whether
drug resistance was related to decreased apoptosis, we

3B, below). While the control cells transfected with
empty vector displayed growth in monolayers, resembling
parental cells in morphology (Figure 3B, upper). In culture
flask, we observed anchorage-dependent colonies with
green fluorescence (mTRIP13 conjugated with GFP) in
mTRIP13-OE but not in empty vector fibroblasts (Figure
3C). We then performed and compared anchorageindependent colony formation in soft agar between
mTRIP13-OE and EV NIH/3T3 cells, using a KRAS
mutated (V12, activating mutant) and overexpressed
NIH/3T3 cells as a positive control. Similar to RASmediated colony transformation, mTRIP13-OE also
exhibited the capacity of clonogenesis. After a 2-week
culture, we observed 40–50 colonies in each well of
6-well plate with mTRIP13-OE, whereas no pronounced
colony was found plated with control cells (Figure 3D).
We then selected one of the mTRIP13-OE clones from
soft agar and independently expanded it in liquid media
for further analysis. To assess the role of mTRIP13
in tumorigenesis in vivo, we subcutaneously injected

NIH/3T3 cells, or cells isolated from colonies into each
flank of NOD/SCID mice, and evaluated tumor growth
respectively. As a result, tumor mass was palpable on
day 17 post injection in colony-isolated cells, on day 19
in mTRIP13-OE cells, but was not obviously palpable
in empty vector-transfected control cells on day 26 post
injection. Totally, all mice with colony-isolated cells
developed tumors. Of the mice injected with mTRIP13OE cells, 60% (three of five) developed tumors. By
contrast, none of the mice injected with empty vectortransfected cells had tumors (Figure 3E). It is also well
known that p53 deletion and mutations are involved in
MM pathogenesis [11], we thus compared the mTRIP13
mRNA between p53-/- mouse embryo fibroblast cells
(MEF) and wild type MEFs. The mTRIP13 was almost 10fold higher in p53-/- MEF (Figure 3F) and 8-fold higher in
KRAS mutated and overexpressed NIH/3T3 cells (Figure
3G) compared to their counterparts, respectively.

Mice were properly sacrificed and tumors were dissected
on Day 32 (Figure 4H). We observed that, tumor size
was significantly smaller in the TRIP13-ShRNA mice
compared to those controls (Figure 4I, p < 0.05).

Overexpression of TRIP13 abrogates the spindle
checkpoint
TRIP13 plays an important role in chromosomal
structure development during mitosis [9]. Mitosis-specific
phosphor-proteins include topoisomerase II alpha,
microtubule associated protein, NimA and two Cdc2inhibitory kinases. These proteins sharing epitopes that
are phosphorylated during the induction of mitosis could
be recognized by monoclonal antibody mitotic protein
monocolonal 2 (MPM2), which is regarded as a mitotic
marker [12]. To evaluate if TRIP13 plays a role in MM
mitosis, TRIP13-OE and empty vector ARP1 cells were
treated with the spindle toxin 100 ng/ml nocodazole for
18h. MM cells were then stained with propidium iodide
(PI) and MPM2, and analyzed by FCM. MM cells having
4N DNA content and being MPM2-positive concurrently
indicate mitosis. Clearly, Tripl3-OE ARP1 cells showed
much less mitotic cells compared to those control cells
treated with nocodazole (Figure 5A and 5B, p < 0.05),
suggesting that high-level TRIP13 could deactivate spindle
checkpoint and halt mitotic progression in the presence
of spindle poisons. Furthermore, phosphorylation of
histone H3 at Ser10 is tightly correlated with chromosome
condensation during mitosis and is considered as another
mitotic marker [13]. Consistently, TRIP13-OE also
decreased the levels of phospho-histone H3 in ARP1 cells
treated with the indicated concentrations of nocodazole
(Figure 5C).

Knockdown of TRIP13 inhibits myeloma cell
growth in vitro and in vivo
We designed three independent TRIP13-ShRNA
sequences, which target discrete coding regions of
TRIP13, resulting in an approximately 80% knockdown
of TRIP13 mRNA upon doxycycline (Dox) treatment
for the most effective one (Figure 4A). ARP1 and OCIMY5 MM cell lines were infected TRIP13-ShRNA by
lentiviral delivery. Cell growth was monitored daily for
5 consecutive days after TRIP13 knockdown (48 h post
Dox treatment) and nontarget scramble (SCR)-transfected
cells were used as controls. Data showed that silencing of
TRIP13 significantly inhibited MM cell growth in both
ARP1 and OCI-MY5 cell lines compared to the scrambled
controls (Figure 4B, p < 0.05). To determine whether
apoptosis contributed to TRIP13-ShRNA mediated
cell growth inhibition, we examined PARP and cleaved
caspase 3 by western blotting. TRIP13 knockdown led to
pronounced apoptosis in ARP1 and OCI-MY5 after 48
hours of Dox treatment (Figure 4C). We also performed
a colony formation assay in TRIP13-ShRNA MM cells.
Knockdown of TRIP13 decreased anchorage-independent
colony number in both ARP1 and OCI-MY5 cell lines
(Figure 4D). The Figure 4E presented the whole well
colonies and showed that the number is significantly
decreased in TRIP13-ShRNA ARP1 cells compared to
scramble ones (p < 0.05).
We next determined the effects of TRIP13ShRNA on MM cell growth in vivo. OCI-MY5 MM cells
transduced with TRIP13-ShRNA or scrambled vectors
were injected subcutaneously into the abdomen of NOD
Rag/null gamma mice (five mice in each group). Dox
was added into the drinking water 16 days post tumor
engraftment to induce TRIP13 knockdown, which was
validated from tumor masses (Figure 4F). Tumor growth
of each group was evaluated every four days (Figure 4G).

Overexpression of TRIP13 induces proteasome
degradation of MAD2 through Akt pathway
Spindle checkpoint proteins are critical to the
mitotic arrest. MAD2 is a key component of the spindle
checkpoint; it binds to and inhibits the APC/C activator
CDC20, and prevents the precocious onset of anaphase by
inducing mitotic arrest in the presence of spindle poisons
[14]. We performed western blots and observed that
overexpression of TRIP13 decreased MAD2 protein not
only in human MM cell lines ARP1, OCI-MY5 and H929,
but also in HEK293T cells (Figure 6A). However, the
decreased levels of MAD2 protein were not consistent with
MAD2 mRNA expression, which was not significantly
changed in TRIP13-OE cells compared to control cells
(Figure 6B). Moreover, MAD2 protein stability has been
assessed using cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis.
Consistent decreases in MAD2 were observed in TRIP13OE ARP1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, we
hypothesized that TRIP13 regulates MAD2 expression
in a post-translational modification manner. To test this

hypothesis, MAD2 protein was analyzed in the myeloma
ARP1 cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor either
MG132 or Bortezomib. Results demonstrated MAD2
was significantly elevated upon proteasome inhibition,
suggesting that MAD2 protein is indeed degraded in
proteasomes (Figure 6C). Furthermore, the MAD2 protein
was partially rescued after addition of MG132 for 4 hours
in TRIP13-OE ARP1 cells (Figure 6D). While the MAD2
protein was elevated in the ARP1 cells knocked down
TRIP13, which was similar to the MG-132 treatment
(Figure 6E). The similar results were observed in 293T
cells (Supplementary Figure 3). These data support
that high levels of TRIP13 increase the degradation of
MAD2 protein.
We further determined whether TRIP13 increases
MAD2ubiquitination. The lysates from HEK293T cells
with or without TRIP13-OE were co-immunoprecipitated
with the MAD2 antibodies in the presence of MG132.
The ubiquitinatedMAD2 was detected by anti-ubiquitin
antibody. As shown in the Figure 6F, TRIP13-OE
significantly increased the ubiquitination of MAD2 protein
(Figure 6F). Western blots were also performed to examine
the expression of p-Akt, p-P38 MAPK and p-P44/42
MAPK in TRIP13-OE ARP1 cells, we found that the
phosphorylated Akt was obviously increased in TRIP13OE cells (Figure 6G). However, phosphorylation of P38
and p-P44/42 MAPK were not significantly changed after
TRIP13 overexpression. Further, we demonstrated a PI3K/

Akt inhibitor LY294002 significantly elevated MAD2
levels at 12 h in TRIP13-OE ARP1 cells. In addition, the
combination of MG132 with LY294002 further increased
the MAD2 protein abundance, suggesting an additive
role of proteasome inhibition (Figure 6H). Furthermore,
PI3K/Akt inhibition by LY294002 pretreatment
partially restored cell sensitivity to Bortezomib in
TRIP13-OE myeloma cells, although LY294002 alone
had slightly inhibitive effects (Figure 6I). Therefore,
these results indicate that the Akt pathway is possibly
required for MAD2 degradation and drug resistance in
TRIP13-OE cells.

DISCUSSION
As early as 2006, TRIP13 has been identified as
one of the 25 chromosome instability (CIN) genes by
analyzing 18 solid tumor data sets [15]. Consistently, we
recently found that CIN-related genes, including TRIP13,
are associated with drug resistance and poor outcomes in
MM [5].
In this study, we further demonstrate in detail that
TRIP13 increases with the progression of MM, while
high level TRIP13 relates to relapsed MM patients and
shortened OS. These clinical data support that TRIP13
may play a critical role in MM pathogenesis. Since
human TRIP13 has two isoforms: isoform 1 with 432
amino acids (AA) and isoform 2 with 289 AA which

has a shorter C-terminus, we specified isoform 1 as
the TRIP13 expression signal derived from the GEP
data by analyzing sequences of the 11 probe sets from
Affymetrix U133Plus2 platform. Therefore, all studies
applied in this project are designated for the long
isoform of TRIP13.
TRIP13, a mouse orthologue of pachytene
checkpoint 2 (Pch2), is required during meiotic doublestrand break repair and is critical in the regulation of
the meiotic chromosome structure and recombination
in the yeast Caenorhabditiselegans [16, 17]. Human
TRIP13 has been reported to be a novel kinetochore
protein, which directly interacts with mitotic checkpoint
silencing protein p31 and plays an important role in
mitosis to achieve faithful chromosome segregation
[18]. Also, we have sequenced the genomes of the
TRIP13-overexpressing MM cell line ARP1 (ARP1OE) and empty vector-transfected control cells. By
DNA copy number variations (CNVs) analysis we
identified 102 putative CNV events occurring in the
ARP1-OE cells (Supplementary Figure 3), providing
direct evidence that TRIP13 is involved in chromosome
stability. However, mis-segregation of chromosomes and
aneuploidy are often associated with the development of
cancers. High TRIP13 expression has been identified in
multiple cancers, including prostate cancer [19], primary
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [20], non-small cell lung
cancer [21], and breast cancer [22]. Furthermore, the
high expression of TRIP13 has been associated with
aggressive subtype, treatment resistance, and enhanced
repair of DNA damage in head and neck cancer [10]. The
same study that used a chick chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) assay suggested that the overexpression of
human TRIP13 in mouse fibroblasts NIH/3T3 cells
resulted in focus formation, cell proliferation, and tumor
growth in vivo [10]. Our GEP data also show TRIP13
is significantly increased in MM patients compared to
NPC and MGUS samples, providing clinical evidence
that TRIP13 could be oncogenic. Consistently, we found
that murine TRIP13, which shares 93% protein identity
with human TRIP13, could also lead to malignant
cell transformation both in vitro and in vivo when
overexpressed in non-malignant NIH/3T3 cells. These
results confirm that TRIP13 has an oncogenic potential.
P53 has been demonstrated to mediate cancer stem–like
cell function by inhibiting pluripotency and cellular
dedifferentiation. P53 deletion has been identified in over
10% of newly diagnosed MM patients and is regarded as
a poor prognostic factor [11]. In addition, the oncogenic
RAS has been shown to play an important role for MM
cell survival [23] and indicates refractory disease [24].
Interestingly, in our study, the observation that TRIP13
was higher in p53-/-NIH/3T3 and also in KRAS mutated
MEFs indicates TRIP13 could be a downstream factor
regulated by p53 and/or KRAS. However, the detailed
network among p53, RAS and TRIP13 in their oncogenic
network needs further study.

Drug-resistant subclones in MM, either present at
diagnosis or developed after chemotherapy treatment, are
responsible for treatment failure resulting in MM relapse
and patient death. The observations based on GEP data,
that increased TRIP13 expression in patients with poor
survival and again in relapsed MM samples, suggest that
TRIP13 may play a major role in MM progression. We
found indeed high TRIP13 increases MM cell growth
and drug resistance in vitro, while knockdown of TRIP13
inhibits MM cell survival. Previously, we have shown
that NEK2 upregulates the expression of drug efflux
pumps such as MDR1 (ABCB1) and MRP1 (ABCC1)
[5]. However, we did not find such molecular alteration in
TRIP13-OE cells (data not shown), indicating that other
mechanisms involved.
Dysfunction of checkpoint proteins leads to
impairments of DNA damage repair and subsequent CIN.
Spindle checkpoint proteins, also called mitotic checkpoint
complex (MCC), consist of the MAD2, BubR1, and Bub3,
which secure accuracy of chromosome segregation
[25]. Defects in MCC surveillance system contribute to
chromosome mis-segregation, aneuploidy and a failure
to arrest in mitosis in the presence of microtubule
poisons, ultimately leading to the development of human
cancers and drug resistance in cancer [2]. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that TRIP13, in conjunction with
the MAD2-binding protein p31comet, inactivates MCC,
presenting as a mitotic checkpoint-silencing protein
[4, 26]. In worms, TRIP13, an AAA+ ATPase, was
found to catalyze MAD2 from a signaling-active closed
conformer to an inactive open conformer to disassemble
and inactivate MCC [16]. In this study, we show that
overexpression of TRIP13 decreases MAD2 protein in
human MM cell lines and HEK293T cells, as well as in
murine fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells (data not shown). MAD2
(mitotic arrest deficiency protein 2), a key component for
regulating MCC surveillance system, plays an inhibitory
role in anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)
by counteracting the effect of CDC20 [14]. When the
MCC surveillance system is turned on, MAD2 forms a
complex with CDC20 and APC/C, inactivates securin and
separase, and consequently arrests cells at prometaphase.
Conversely, the reduced expression of MAD2 protein
results in attenuated MCC surveillance and subsequent
CIN and drug resistance [27]. The down-regulation or
deletion of MAD2 also has been reported in a variety
of human cancers. Moreover, downregulation of MAD2
is shown to increase proliferation and enhance the
drug resistance in gastric cancer cells by increasing
expression of phosphorylated survivin [28]. However, the
mechanisms underlying the downregulation of MAD2
have not been fully elucidated. Our study of MM model,
for the first time, brings out that decreased MAD2 is in part
caused by high TRIP13 enhanced MAD2 ubiquitination
and proteasome degradation, although it is not clear how
TRIP13 promotes MAD2ubiquitination. Considering the
role of TRIP13 in the conformational change of MAD2
26727

Constructs of letivirus plasmids for TRIP13
overexpression and conditional knockdown,
quantitative real-time PCR

to inactivate MCC in worms [16], we propose that
TRIP13 possibly has a dual-effect on the inhibition of
MAD2 to dissemble MCC and attenuate the surveillance
system. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role
in the regulation of survival, proliferation, migration,
angiogenesis, and drug resistance of MM cells [29]. Also,
PI3K/Akt activation occurs during the ubiquitination and
degradation of other proteins to regulate tumorigenesis
and chemoresistance [30, 31]. We also demonstrate that
the Akt pathway mediates MAD2 degradation induced by
TRIP13 and PI3k/Akt inhibition could in part revert drug
resistance to Bortezomib. It suggests that the Akt inhibitor,
which has been used in clinic [32], may be functional to
target TRIP13 related tumor features.
Taken together, TRIP13 ubiquitinates and degrades
the checkpoint surveillance protein MAD2 via activating
Akt signaling pathway, leading to weakened checkpoint
surveillance and consequent tumorigenic aneuploidy and
drug resistance in MM. Our data suggest that targeting
TRIP13 may provide a novel treatment to overcome drug
resistance in MM.

pCDH and pCAG/AIG constructs were used to
generate human and murine TRIP13 overexpression
plasmids respectively. Packaging plasmid VSVG and
psPAX2 are required to produce recombinant lentivirus.
The nucleotide sequences of the primers were as follows:
Human TRIP13, sense: 5′-AAAATCTAGAATGGACGAG
GCCGTGG-3′, antisense: 5′-AAAAGGATCCTCAGATGT
AAGCTGCAAGC-3′ (accession number NM_004237.3).
Murine TRIP13, sense: 5′-AAATCTAGAATGGATTACAA
GGACGACGATGACAAGGACGAGGCGGTGGGCGA
CC-3′, antisense: 5′-AAAGGATCCTCAAACATAAGCTGA
AAGTTTCTTTTTCTCCTCAAACTG-3′ (accession number
NM_027182.2). In addition, pTripZ-TRIP13-ShRNA
was constructed to generate conditional knockdown of
human TRIP13. Three different synthetic oligonucleotide
sequences specific for TRIP13 silencing (ShRNA) were
designed, with one identified as most effective shown in the
following: 5′-GTTGACAGTGAGCGACACCAAGGCCAG
GCTTTGTTATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATAACAAAGC
CTGGCCTTGGTGGTGCCTACTGCCT-3′. A nonsense
scrambled oligonucleotide was used as a control.
Recombinant lentivirus was produced by transient
transfection of HEK293T cells using packaging plasmid
VSVG and psPAX2. Transfection of myeloma cell lines
by lentivirus was performed using polybrene. Transduced
cell lines were selected in puromycin. After 3 days of
selection, puromycin was removed and efficient knockdown of TRIP13 were induced 48 hours post Doxycycline
(Dox, 10ng/ml) treatment. All constructed plasmids carry
fluorescence proteins. Efficiency of viral transfection was
> 95% determined by percentage of transfected cells with
fluorescence using flow cytometry. As for in vivo TRIP13
knockdown, Dox (2mg/ml) was added into the drinking
water 16 days post tumor engraftment. Experimental
procedures for quantitative real-time PCR with target
genes were described before [33].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples from patients with multiple myeloma
and accession numbers
To analyze the expression data of TRIP13 and
associated clinical information, all the microarrays
were performed on primary myeloma samples. The
Gene Expression Omnibus database accession numbers
described in this article were retrieved from GSE19554,
GSE24080, GSE2658, GSE31161, GSE5900 and
GSE6205. Kaplan-Meier analyses of overall survival (OS)
about patients in the TT2 and TT3 cohorts were performed
using methods implemented in the R package survival.
All other statistical analyses, including the evaluation
about the statistical significance of differences in TRIP13
expression between patient groups were performed using
student’s t-test. The probe sequences of Tripl3 signature
were obtained from Affymetrix official website (www.
affymetrix.com) and have been identified specific to the
non-coding sequence of TRIP13 isoform 1 by sequence
blast.

Co-immunoprecipitation assay and
western blot analysis
107 cells were washed once in PBS, and lysed in
1ml lysis buffer (pierce 87788) containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitor (pierce 88669), and centrifuged
for 10min at 16000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was
transferred to a fresh tube. MAD2 proteins were
immunoprecipitated with proteinA/G beads covalently
linked to an anti-MAD2 antibody. Experimental
procedures for co-immunoprecipitation are as described
[34]. After SDS–PAGE, the samples were transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting analysis was
performed with anti-ubiquitin antibody and other indicated
antibodies as described before for detailed procedures
[33].

Cell growth and viability assay
Myeloma cells were grown in RPMI1640 (Gibco)
at 37°C, 5% carbon-dioxide and saturated humidity. The
media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2
mM L-glutamine (Gibco). For cell growth, the live cells
were counted by trypan blue dye exclusion assay for
3-5 days. Cell viability was detected using PrestoBlue
Cell viability reagent (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and presented as the
percentage relative to control cells.

α-MPM2 (Millipore) followed by fluorescence-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). After washed with PBS
once, cells were stained with propidium iodide and then
analyzed by FACS with FacsScan (Becton Dickinson).
The results were studied using the FlowJo software.

1×104 NIH/3T3 cells transduced with control
vector or murine TRIP13 (mTRIP13) were mixed with
RPMI1640 media containing 10% FBS and 0.33% agar
and layered on top of the base layer of 0.5% agar in each
well of 6-well plates. Colony numbers were counted after
approximately 2 weeks. Colony cells were isolated with
a 1-ml pipet and transferred to 12-well plates for further
analysis. For the myeloma line ARP1 and OCI-MY5
cells with TRIP13 knockdown, the same colony-forming
method was applied. All plates were pictured under
microscope and overall numbers of colony in the pictures
were scanned and counted by the Image J software.

Statistical analysis
All data were shown as means±SD. The Student’s t
test was applied to compare two experimental groups. The
relevance of TRIP13 expression to disease progression,
event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was
measured using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank
test was used for group comparison. Significance was set
at p < 0.05.

Murine model of tumorigenesis and human
myeloma in NOD-Rag/Null gamma mice

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

All animal work was performed under approved
protocol in accordance with the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and local veterinary office and
ethics committee of Tongji University. Each group consisted
of five mice. For tumorigenesis assay, 2.5×105 NIH/3T3
cells transduced with control vector or mTRIP13, or colony
cells isolated from mTRIP13 overexpressing NIH/3T3 cells
were injected subcutaneously into each side of mice dorsa.
Tumor incidence and the number of tumor nodules from
each group were counted and compared among them. For
murine model of human myeloma, myeloma line OCI-MY5
cells were transduced with TRIP13-ShRNA or scrambled
(SCR) control vectors. 1.5×106 cells (in 100 ml PBS) were
injected subcutaneously into the abdomen of NOD-Rag/
null gamma mice. TRIP13 knockdown was induced by the
addition of doxycycline (2 mg/ml) to the drinking water
16 days after injection when tumor masses were palpable.
Tumor length and width were gauged, and tumor volume
was calculated as (length × width2) × 0.5. For each time
point, results are presented as the mean tumor volume ± SD
for the indicated mice.
