BACKGROUND: In this prospective study, progression-free survival (PFS) and the safety profiles of docetaxel/capecitabine (TX) and
vinorelbine/capecitabine (NX) followed by capecitabine maintenance therapy were compared in patients with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to a TX group (n 5 104) and an NX group
(n 5 102), both of which included capecitabine maintenance medication. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: The trial met its primary endpoint and was closed to accrual subsequent to interim analysis. Forty-eight patients in the TX
group (46.2%) and 42 patients in the NX group (41.2%) received maintenance medication. The median PFS (8.4 vs 7.1 months; P 5
.0026; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.3; hazard ratio, 1.65), the response duration (7.8 vs 6.6 months; P 5 .0451), and the median overall survival (OS) (35.3 vs 19.8 months; P 5 .1349; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.47; hazard ratio, 1.48) in the TX group appeared to
be longer compared with those in the NX group, although the difference did reach not statistical significance. Patients aged 40
years who were postmenopausal and presented with visceral metastases were more likely to benefit from the TX regimen in terms of
PFS and OS, whereas positive hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status or a history of taxane treatments did not affect differences in PFS and OS between the TX and NX groups. Hand-foot syndrome occurred more frequently in
the TX group than in the NX group (47% vs 16.7%; P < .0001), but the frequencies of other minor adverse effects were similar in
both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A TX regimen for advanced breast cancer followed by capecitabine maintenance medication led to longer PFS and response duration than an NX regimen, even for patients who had previously received taxane in (neo)adjuvant settings.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancers have metastasized or are inoperable after the initial diagnosis,1 and these
patients commonly receive treatment with combinations of anthracyclines and taxanes.2 However, readministration of
anthracyclines to patients with anthracycline-pretreated breast cancers may be associated with reduced efficacy and significant cardiotoxicity.3 Previous literature reported that a combination therapy of docetaxel and capecitabine (TX) was superior to docetaxel monotherapy.4,5 The TX combination has been used successfully for patients with anthracyclinepretreated breast cancer6; and, although National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend the preferential
use of a single cytotoxic agent, they also recommend a TX regimen for the management of patients who have stage IV disease and recurrent metastasis. Thus, in China, the TX regimen has become a standard first-line regimen for the treatment
of patients with advanced breast cancer who do not respond to anthracyclines.7-9
However, the increasing use of taxane-based chemotherapies in the early stages of breast cancer makes the management of recurrent disease more difficult. Vinorelbine and capecitabine are among the drugs of first choice for
anthracycline-resistant and/or taxane-resistant breast cancer, because they have both demonstrated activity and acceptable
toxicity in pretreated patients.10,11 Given the comparable antitumor activity of the 2 drugs and their nonoverlapping toxicities, several phase 1 and 2 trials have explored the efficacy of a vinorelbine/capecitabine (NX) combination in patients
with chemotherapy-naive or pretreated breast cancers.9-17 Although the reported results indicated that overall response

rates (ORRs) ranged from 37% to 68%, the sample sizes
were small (range, 18-70 patients), which led to a lack of
statistical efficacy.12-20 Therefore, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the ORR of the NX combination
is superior to that of the TX combination. Recently, it was
reported that maintenance chemotherapy improved PFS
to various degrees, especially in patients who had human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative,
estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, or ER-positive disease
but were resistant to endocrine therapy.21,22 Maintenance
chemotherapy refers to the continuation of a part of
the primary chemotherapy regimen in progression-free
patients after the initial standard treatment plan phase
(6-8 cycles) with the objective of prolonging PFS. Because
maintenance therapy can significantly prolong the time to
relapse and the duration of PFS, the appropriate maintenance chemotherapy agent must meet the following have
confirmed efficacy, low toxicity, and a convenient mode
of administration. Because capecitabine as monotherapy
has been evaluated as a mature method for treating
advanced breast cancers with significant efficacy against
metastatic disease in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials,20,23,24 its
relative minor toxicity and unique property of oral administration makes it a new and desirable option for maintenance chemotherapy.
For the current study, we conducted a single-center,
prospective, randomized, noninferiority phase 3 trial
comparing the TX and NX regimens as first-line treatments followed by capecitabine maintenance for patients
with advanced breast cancer. The primary endpoint was
PFS, and the major secondary endpoints included overall
survival (OS), the response rate (RR), the duration of
response (DOR), and safety.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This was a prospective, open, and randomized phase 3
study in a single center. Between April 2010 and February
2013, patients with pathologically confirmed, invasive,
unresectable breast cancer in an advanced localized or
metastatic stage were included. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital. All patients signed
written informed consent before any study-specific procedures were performed. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the
International Conference on Harmonization Guideline
on Good Clinical Practice. The clinical trial registration
number (clincaltrials.gov) is NCT01126138.

Randomization and Masking

After stratification based on whether or not the patients
had received anthracycline or taxane adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapies and their HER2/hormone receptor status, 206 patients were randomly allocated to the TX
group (n 5 104) and the NX group (n 5 102). The
inclusion criteria were women ages 18 to 75 years with
histologically confirmed, measurable breast cancer and
metastasis; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status <2; life expectancy 3 months; a
left ventricular ejection fraction within the hospitalâ€™s
normal range (55%-70%); and adequate hematologic,
hepatic, and renal functions. Patients may have received
several prior endocrine therapies in adjuvant and/or
metastatic settings. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed
after any previous radiotherapy. The exclusion criteria
were the receipt of prior chemotherapy after a diagnosis
of metastatic breast cancer, primary and/or adjuvant
chemotherapy within the previous 12 months, metastases limited to the bone, symptomatic brain metastases,
secondary carcinomas (except for curatively treated basal cell carcinomas of the skin or in situ cervical carcinoma), pre-existing grade 1 peripheral neuropathy,
known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs or components administered, myocardial infarction within the
previous 6 months, uncompensated cardiac insufficiency or other severe cardiovascular conditions, psychiatric disorders, and participation in other clinical trials
within the previous 4 weeks.
Treatments

Patients in the NX group received oral capecitabine
1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 through 14 plus an
intravenous injection of vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on days
1 and 8 in a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 6 to 8 cycles.
Patients in the TX group received oral capecitabine
1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 through 14 plus an
intravenous injection of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 in
a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 6 to 8 cycles. Upon
completion of the primary treatments described above,
patients without disease progression (complete response
[CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease) received
capecitabine maintenance (oral capecitabine 1000 mg/
m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 7-day rest period) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or
death. Throughout the study, patients were evaluated
every 6 weeks, and those who had disease progression
were taken off the study; further treatment decisions for
these patients were completed at the discretion of their
attending physicians (Fig. 1).

Outcome Assessments

Before treatment, each patient underwent a thorough
clinical examination, standard laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and tumor assessment (tumor-specific radiology, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and/or
magnetic resonance imaging according to indications and
clinical standards), and each patientâ€™s prior medical history was recorded. During treatment, hematologic tests
were carried out every week. Before each therapy cycle,
patients underwent physical examinations; and Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, clinical
chemistry data, as well as toxicities were recorded. Tumors
were assessed every 3 cycles according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (version 1.1). A
final assessment was performed 3 to 6 weeks after study
therapy was completed and included clinical examination,
assessment of toxicities, laboratory tests, as well as tumor
assessments. Patients were followed every 2 months for
the first 2 years after the last cycle and every 6 months
thereafter. The primary endpoint was PFS, defined as the
interval from the date of randomization to the date disease
progression was diagnosed, or the date secondary malignant disease was diagnosed, or the date of death from any
3414

cause within 90 days. Secondary endpoints were OS,
defined as the interval between randomization and death;
DOR, defined as the interval from a documented CR or
PR to the first date of disease progression; and the
response rate as well as tolerability, which were estimated
according to the incidence and severity of adverse events
and graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Dose Modifications

If patients experienced febrile neutropenia, grade 4 leukopenia, or grade 3 thrombocytopenia, then treatment was
interrupted until the patientâ€™s neutrophil count recovered
to 1.5 3 109/L and their platelet count recovered to 100
3 109/L. Treatment was then continued at reduced doses
of docetaxel 60 mg/m2, vinorelbine 20 mg/m2, and capecitabine 750 mg/m2 twice daily. If grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity recurred, then the treatments were
interrupted and were continued after resolution with hematopoietic growth factor support. Doses of docetaxel,
vinorelbine, and capecitabine were reduced if patients
experienced grade 2 neurologic toxicities, and treatment
was discontinued if patients developed grade 3 or 4

sensory neuropathy. If patients experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity and/or grade 2 hand-foot syndrome,
then capecitabine therapy was interrupted until resolution
to grade 1 or 0 and then was continued at a reduced dose.
If these toxicities recurred, then capecitabine therapy was
interrupted again until recovery; and, when it was
resumed at a reduced dosage, the treatment-free interval
in each cycle was extended from 7 days to 14 days. Doses
of all the drugs were reduced if patients experienced grade
3 or 4 mucositis. Treatment was discontinued if any toxicity had not been resolved after 42 days.
Statistical Methods

This study was designed under a noninferiority assumption. The enrollment period was set to 24 months, and the
study follow-up period lasted until 3 years after the first
visit. The noninferiority margin for PFS was defined as 1.5
months with a 7-month median PFS for the TX group and
a 5.3-month median PFD for the NX group.5,10-14 IniOctober 1, 2015

tially, we calculated that, under 80% power and with a 1sided a value of .025, 272 patients were needed for each
arm, but the study was terminated earlier than planned
because of the lack of enrollment in addition to an interim
analysis, which indicated that PFS rates evidently differed
between the 2 groups. The primary endpoint was PFS,
which was assessed with noninferiority tests. Kaplan-Meier
tests were used to analyze PFS and OS, which are reported
as the median PFS or OS, 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
and log-rank test P values. PFS and OS data were analyzed
with a Cox proportional hazards model (forest plot), and
the results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) between the
2 groups along with 95% CIs and P values obtained from
Wald tests. Chi-square tests and Fisher exact tests were used
for the analyses of secondary endpoints (optimal tumor
response assessment, DOR, and clinical benefit rate).
Response rates were analyzed using a single-factor logistic
regression model, and the results are reported as the odds
ratios between the 2 groups with 95% CIs and Wald test
P values. The significance level was defined as 5% in all
statistical analyses.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of the Patients

In total, 206 women with advanced breast cancer were enrolled, including 104 in the TX group and 102 in the NX
group (median age, 52 years in each group). The baseline
characteristics of the patients were well balanced in the 2
treatment groups (Table 1). The majority of patients had
visceral metastases (69.9% in the TX group and 65.7% in
the NX group), and most were postmenopausal (65.7%
in the TX group and 62.6% in NX group).

was received for an average of 6.6 cycles in the TX group
and 5.5 cycles in the NX group. The median number of
cycles for both groups was 6 (range 1-8 cycles) (Table 2).
Median relative dose intensities were 95.5% for docetaxel,
98.8% for vinorelbine, and 93.5% for capecitabine
(93.8% in the TX group and 92.6% in the NX group).
The most common reason of premature treatment discontinuation was disease progression, which developed in 20
patients (19.2%) in the TX group and 26 patients
(25.5%) in the NX group. Patients in both groups
received their therapy at or near the full intended doses.
Efficacy

PFS was the primary endpoint in our study, which was
met by 91 patients in the TX group (87.5%) and 81
patients in the NX group (79.4%). The median PFS in
the TX group was significantly longer than that in the NX
group (8.4 months [95% CI, 7.2-9.8 months] vs 7.1
months [95% CI, 4.9-7.9], respectively; HR, 1.65; 95%
CI, 1.18-2.3; P 5 .0026) (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, in a
univariate HR subgroup analysis of all factors related to
PFS, patients aged 40 years (HR, 1.6) and those who
were postmenopausal (HR, 1.55) were more likely to benefit from the TX regimen. Hormone receptor status and
HER2 status, as well as taxane exposure in a (neo)adjuvant
treatment setting, were not associated with increased PFS
in the TX group versus the NX group (Fig. 2B).
The TX group tended to have a longer median OS
than the NX group (35.3 vs 19.8 months), but the difference was not statistically significant (35.3 vs 19.8 months;
HR, 1.48, 95% CI, 0.88-2.47; P 5 .1349) (Fig. 3A). In a
univariate analysis of independent factors associated with
OS, we observed that patients who were aged 40 years,

postmenopausal, and had a disease-free survival 2 years
with visceral metastases were more likely to benefit from
the TX regimen.
Hormone receptor status and HER2 status as well as
taxane experience in a (neo)adjuvant treatment setting
were not associated with prolonged medium OS periods
in the TX group versus the NX group (Fig. 3B). Regarding the ORR (CR 1 PR) and the clinical benefit rate (CR
1 PR 1 stable disease >4 months), there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (Table 3).
The TX group had a significantly longer median
DOR than the NX group (7.8 vs 6.6 months, respectively;
P 5 .0451) (Fig. 4). The proportion of patients who
entered the capecitabine maintenance phase (-X) was
similar between the 2 groups, including 48 patients in the
TX-X group (46.2%) and 42 in the NX-X group
(41.2%).
Toxicity

During the combination therapy phase, there were fewer
patients in the TX group than in the NX group who had
at least 1 grade 1 or 2 adverse event (28 vs 40 patients,
respectively); however, there were more patients in the TX
group who had at least 1 grade 3 or 4 adverse event (60 vs
46 patients, respectively). All grade 3 and 4 adverse events
were resolved after proper management, and no death was

reported because of an adverse reaction. The TX group
had a higher occurrence rate of hand-foot syndrome than
the NX group (47% vs 16.7%; P < .0001). Other side
effects, such as peripheral neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal
reactions, neutropenia, and joint pain, occurred at similar
low rates in both groups (Table 4).
The median number of cycles for maintenance therapy was 4 cycles; during maintenance therapy, the major
side effect was hand-foot syndrome in both groups
(18.7% in the TX group and 14.3% in the NX group).
More patients had to reduce or interrupt treatments
because of side effects in the TX group than in the NX
group (19.2% compared with 5.9%; P 5 .002); in both
groups, the most common side effect leading to an interCancer

The safety data were consistent with our interim safety
analysis.25
DISCUSSION
We observed that TX treatment was superior to NX treatment in terms of PFS for patients with advanced breast
cancer if both were followed by capecitabine maintenance
therapy. The difference in median PFS between the TX
and NX groups (8.4 months [95% CI. 7.2-9.8 months] vs
7.1 months [95% CI, 4.9-7.9 months], respectively) was
statistically significant (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.18-2.3; P 5
.0026) (Fig. 2A). Previous reports noted that regimens
consisting of capecitabine and taxane produced significant

antitumor activity.6,23,24 In a phase 3 trial of women
who had anthracycline-resistant, metastatic breast cancer, the addition of capecitabine to docetaxel therapy significantly improved the ORR (42% vs 30%; P 5 .006),
the median time to progression (6.1 months vs 4.2
months; P 5 .0001), and the median OS (14.5 months
vs 11.5 months; P 5 .0126) compared with single-agent
docetaxel medication6; however, patients who received
the combination regimen experienced a higher incidence
of hand-foot syndrome. In that study, the initial dose of
capecitabine was 1250 mg/m2 twice daily; however,
when the capecitabine dose was reduced to not less than
50%, the efficacy was not influenced. Therefore, we used
1000 mg/m2 as the initial capecitabine dose in our study.
The results of our analysis clearly demonstrate that the
TX first-line regimen followed by capecitabine maintenance achieved significantly longer PFS than the NX regimen, even in the subgroup that previously received
paclitaxel, which represented 70% of the intention-totreat population (Fig. 2B), indicating that docetaxel
combined with capecitabine may confer better efficacy
compared with NX. In addition, a first-line TX regimen
followed by capecitabine maintenance achieved significantly better PFS and OS rates than the solely administered first-line capecitabine/docetaxel regimen in the
study by Oâ€™Shaughnessy et al, indicating the benefits of
capecitabine maintenance medication. Hand-foot syndrome was the major adverse effect of our treatment regimen, at a frequency of 47% in TX patients during
combination therapy, which was lower than the rate of
>60% in patients treated jointly with capecitabine and
docetaxel, but without capecitabine maintenance.6 This
finding probably can be attributed to our reduced capecitabine dose (1000 mg/m2 vs 1205 mg/m2). In our
study, we observed that the TX group had a higher rate
of hand-foot syndrome occurrence than the NX group
(47% vs 16.7%; P < .0001); whereas other side effects,
such as peripheral neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal reactions, neutropenia, and joint pain, occurred at similar
rates in both groups and were relatively minor, which is
in line with previous findings (Table 4).26
More patients in the TX group had to reduce or
interrupt the therapy because of side effects compared
with patients in the NX group (19.2% vs 5.9%; P 5
.002). No significant difference in toxicity was observed
between the 2 groups during the maintenance phase (Table 5). The median number of cycles for maintenance
therapy was 4 cycles, during which the major side effect
was also hand-foot syndrome (18.7% in the TX group
and 14.3% in the NX group).

Capecitabine as maintenance therapy was mainly
given for gastrointestinal tumors27 and colorectal cancer.28 Recent reports noted that the use of trastuzumab
and bevacizumab as maintenance therapies for breast cancer had significant clinical benefits.29,30 However, a metaanalysis of the OS data from 3 randomized trials of bevacizumab and first-line chemotherapy as treatment for
patients with metastatic breast cancer revealed that,
although bevacizumab resulted in improved PFS, no statistically significant difference in median OS rates was
detected.31
Our data confirm the safety of first-line chemotherapy with TX or NX and the feasibility of maintenance
treatment with a single drug (capecitabine). Our subgroup analyses revealed that patients who are postmenopausal, aged 40 years, ER-negative or progesterone
receptor-negative, and HER2-positive with metastases in
viscera were more likely to benefit from the TX regimen.
Otherwise, an NX regimen may be a better choice for
first-line treatment, particularly in taxane-intolerant
patients. However, because of the low statistical power of
this study, additional trials are warranted.
In conclusion, TX as a first-line treatment followed
by capecitabine maintenance achieved significantly longer
PFS and DOR with a manageable toxicity profile compared with NX, but additional large-scale trials will be
necessary to confirm this finding. For patients who cannot
tolerate docetaxel or who previously received (neo)adjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy, NX may be considered as
an alternative treatment.
