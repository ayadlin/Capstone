Abstract
DNA glycosylases that remove alkylated and deaminated purine nucleobases are essential DNA
repair enzymes that protect the genome, and at the same time confound cancer alkylation therapy,
by excising cytotoxic N3-methyladenine bases formed by DNA targeting anticancer compounds.
The basis for glycosylase specificity toward N3- and N7-alkylpurines is believed to result from
intrinsic instability of the modified bases and not from direct enzyme functional group chemistry.
Here, we present crystal structures of the recently discovered Bacillus cereus AlkD glycosylase in
complex with DNAs containing alkylated, mismatched, and abasic nucleotides. Unlike other
glycosylases, AlkD captures the extrahelical lesion in a solvent-exposed orientation, providing the
first illustration for how hydrolysis of N3- and N7-alkylated bases may be facilitated by increased
lifetime out of the DNA helix. The structures and supporting biochemical analysis of base flipping
and catalysis reveal how AlkD’s HEAT-repeats distort the DNA backbone to detect non-WatsonCrick base pairs without duplex intercalation.

Alkylation of DNA by endogenous methyl donors, environmental toxins, and
chemotherapeutic agents produces a diverse spectrum of cytotoxic and mutagenic lesions,
including N3-methyladenine (3mA), N7-methylguanine (7mG), and 1,N6-ethenodenine (εA),
that threaten the survival of all organisms 1–5. 3mA is highly toxic owing to its inhibition of
DNA polymerases during replication 6,7, and production of such lesions is the rationale
behind the use of alkylating agents in chemotherapy. N7-substituted guanines are the most
prevalent alkylation lesions and display a wide range of toxic and mutagenic biological

properties 8. By virtue of their positive charges at physiological pH, 3mA and 7mG are
especially susceptible to spontaneous depurination, which generates abasic sites in DNA that
can ultimately lead to single- and double-strand breaks.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DNA glycosylases initiate base excision repair of N3- and N7-methylpurines from the
genome by catalyzing hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (Fig. 1a,b). Despite their
structural diversity, all DNA glycosylases studied to date utilize a common base flipping
mechanism to access damaged DNA and orient the substrate for catalysis by rotating the
target nucleotide 180° around the phosphoribose backbone into a complementary shaped
active site pocket 9,10. The resulting distortion to the DNA is stabilized by an intercalating
side chain “plug” that fills the void created by the extrahelical nucleotide. Glycosylases
typically excise their target nucleobases by using a carboxylate side chain as a general base
to activate a water nucleophile or to stabilize the carbocation transition state during base
dissociation 11. Mutation of this residue, however, does not abolish catalytic activity in all
cases, leading to a model in which conformational strain in the DNA arising from extensive
binding energy helps to drive the reaction forward 12,13. The lack of a residue capable of
performing general base catalysis in 3mA-specific DNA glycosylases (e.g., E. coli
TAG) 14–16 is consistent with the idea that excision of positively charged 3mA and 7mG
does not require the same level of catalytic assistance as more stable ethenoadducts,
although direct evidence for this has not been reported.
AlkC and AlkD proteins, recently discovered in Bacillus cereus and subsequently identified
in all three kingdoms of life (Fig. S1), have emerged as a unique DNA glycosylase
superfamily specific for N3- and N7-alkylpurines 17,18. AlkD accelerates the rate of 7mG
hydrolysis from DNA 100-fold over the spontaneous rate of 7mG depurination 19,
prompting us to investigate the mechanism by which AlkD excises destabilized alkylated
bases. Here, we present crystal structures of B. cereus AlkD in complex with DNA damage
resembling the substrate and product of the glycosylase reaction. These structures, together
with supporting biochemistry of base flipping and 7mG depurination activities, demonstrate
how AlkD utilizes an unprecedented strategy to trap non-canonical base pairs that allows for
specific hydrolysis of destabilized N-glycosidic bonds without direct chemical attack from
the enzyme.

A new architecture for binding nucleic acids
We previously determined the crystal structure of B. cereus AlkD and identified residues
important for DNA binding and catalysis 19. AlkD is comprised entirely of HEAT repeats –
tandem α-helical pairs that generate extended, non-enzymatic scaffolds that typically
mediate protein, but not nucleic acid interactions within their concave surfaces 20–22. AlkD’s
concave surface contains highly conserved residues important for 7mG excision and DNA
binding activities and protection against bacterial sensitivity to alkylating agents 17–19.
To investigate the mechanisms by which this novel enzyme binds DNA and catalyzes base
excision, we determined crystal structures of B. cereus AlkD in complex with DNAs
resembling the substrate and product of 3mA excision (Fig. 1a). Trapping an alkylpurine
DNA glycosylase onto a 3mA-containing substrate has presented a formidable challenge

owing to the inherent instability of the N-glycosidic bond. To overcome this obstacle, we
crystallized AlkD in complex with DNA containing 3-deaza-3-methyladenine (3d3mA), a
structural 3mA mimetic in which the N3 nitrogen is replaced with carbon (Fig. 1c). The
3d3mA base is refractory to spontaneous depurination or excision by AlkD or human
alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) 7, presumably because the 3d3mA purine ring lacks
the formal positive charge associated with 3mA. Importantly, the N3 → C3 substitution does
not affect duplex stability (Supplementary Information) 23. We also crystallized AlkD in
complex with DNA containing a tetrahydrofuran (THF) moiety (Fig. 1d), which resembles
the abasic site product. The AlkD/3d3mA-DNA and AlkD/THF-DNA structures were
determined by molecular replacement and refined to 1.6 Å (R/Rfree=15.9/18.3%) and 1.75 Å
(R/Rfree = 18.5%/22.5%), respectively (Table S1 and Fig. S2).

Both 3d3mA and THF complexes show the same general mode of nucleic acid binding
despite their unique DNA sequences and crystal packing arrangements (Fig. 2). The DNA is
positioned along AlkD’s concave surface, which is lined with positively charged residues
from the C-terminal α-helix of each HEAT repeat (Fig. 1e and Fig. S3). The C-shaped
protein wraps halfway around the DNA helix with a footprint of ~10 base-pairs. The contact
surface is dominated by electrostatic interactions between side chains at the protein midregion and the phosphoribose backbone of the DNA strand opposite the lesion. In contrast,
contacts to the lesioned strand are limited to base pairs further removed from the lesion and
the protein termini (Fig. 2). The DNA axes are bent 30° away from AlkD’s N-terminus as a
result of helix αB (the only non-HEAT repeat in AlkD) projecting into the minor groove
(Fig 2). A 2-Å shift in helix αB is the only noticeable movement in the protein upon DNA
binding (Fig. S4).

A novel lesion capture mechanism

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The most striking feature of the AlkD/DNA complexes is that both 3d3mA and THF reside
on the face of the DNA duplex not in contact with the protein, whereas the base opposite the
lesion is nestled into a cleft on the protein’s concave surface (Figs. 2 and 3). The 3d3mA•T
unpredictably forms a highly sheared base pair in which 3d3mA remains stacked between
T6 and A8, while the opposite thymine (T18) is displaced into the minor groove with no
hydrogen bonds to 3d3mA (Fig. 3a). There are no protein contacts to the T18 base. Rather, it
is held in this position by distortion of the T18/A19 backbone as a result of a hydrogen bond
network among Asp113-Arg148 and Arg190. The protein-DNA interface is further
strengthened by van der Waals interactions between tryptophans 109 and 187 and the
phosphoribose backbone flanking the damaged base pair.
In the product complex, the abasic site is rotated ~90° around the phosphoribose backbone
into the major groove, and is fully solvent exposed (Figs. 2b and 3b). Interestingly, the
opposite thymine is slipped completely out of the base stack and into the minor groove of
the DNA, and is rotated (χ = 58°) so that the plane of the pyrimidine ring is virtually parallel
with the helical axis. Unlike other DNA glycosylases, there is no intercalating side chain
plugging the gap left by the flipped base. As a consequence, the duplex has collapsed in
order to maintain base stacking interactions. Guanine G4, immediately 5′ to the THF, is now
stacked with cytosine C16 on the opposite strand (Fig. 3b). Importantly, the DNA backbone

is highly distorted as a result of the large slide (4.4 Å) and twist (58°) between G4•C18 and
G6•C16 base pairs (Figs. 2b, 3b, S12). A hydrogen bond between Tyr27 at the C-terminal
end of helix αB and the base 3′ to the tipped thymine is the only specific AlkD-nucleobase
contact (Fig. 3). Thus, AlkD stabilizes the distortions in both substrate and product DNA—a
sheared 3d3mA•T base pair and a single base THF•T bubble—through interactions with the
phosphoribose backbone of the non-lesioned strand.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The solvent-exposed capture of DNA damage in the AlkD/DNA structures is both
unexpected and unprecedented for a DNA glycosylase, and raises the possibilities that either
AlkD utilizes a different mechanism to catalyze base excision or that the crystal structures
represent non-specific, catalytically incompetent protein/DNA complexes. Indeed, the
aromatic region at the center of the concave cleft loosely resembles nucleobase binding
pockets of other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases 18,19. However, several important
differences argue against a traditional lesion binding pocket in AlkD. First, AlkD lacks the
plug residue universally used by DNA glycosylases to prevent the flipped substrate base
from re-entering the DNA base stack. Second, an extrahelical nucleobase would be sterically
prohibited from full 180° rotation into this shallow cleft (Fig. 3). Third, high concentrations
of free nucleobases do not inhibit base excision activity by AlkD as observed in other
alkylpurine glycosylases (Fig. S5) 15. Fourth, the electrostatic interaction between Asp113
and Arg148 reduces the likelihood that Asp113 acts as a general base in catalysis. Fifth,
mutation of a putative base binding cleft directly adjacent to the catalytic Asp113 and
Arg148 did not affect 7mG excision activity (Fig. S6). Finally, whereas alkylpurine DNA
glycosylases normally exhibit enhanced excision activity for mispaired alkylbases,
presumably because of their greater propensity to base-flip 15,24,25 AlkD does not
discriminate against the base opposite the lesion (Table S2; Fig. S7).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the orientation of DNA relative to the central cleft during catalysis, we
measured the rate of 7mG excision opposite a bulky nucleotide. A pyrene nucleotide wedge
across from uracil has been shown to enhance base excision by uracil DNA glycosylase
(UDG) and rescue the loss of activity of UDG mutants that lack the Leu191 plug side
chain 26. In contrast, placing pyrene across from 7mG reduced AlkD’s activity 10-fold
relative to a 7mG•C pair (Fig. S7). Superposition of the pyrene onto the opposite thymine in
the AlkD/DNA crystal structures showed that this bulky group would be hindered from
rotating into this tipped position. Thus, the consistency between the crystal structures and
partial inhibition of 7mG activity by an opposing pyrene argues strongly that the crystal
structures represent a catalytically competent orientation of DNA.
In a converse experiment, we tested AlkD’s ability to excise bulky pyridyloxobutyl (POB)
base adducts (Fig. 4a), which arise in DNA upon exposure to cigarette smoke-derived
nitrosamine carcinogens 27. The expectation was that AlkD should excise POB-bases from
DNA, whereas the tightly constrained nucleobase binding pocket of human AAG would
discriminate against bulky alkyl adducts 28. Indeed, AlkD liberated positively charged 7POB-Gua and O2-POB-Cyt adducts from DNA, whereas neither of these modified bases
was detected after treatment with AAG or in a mock reaction containing no enzyme (Fig.
4b,c). Neutral adducts O6-POB-Gua and O2-POB-Thy present in the DNA were not detected
in the supernatant upon reaction with AlkD, consistent with the specificity of AlkD for

positively charged lesions. This result indicates that AlkD need not flip the substrate base
into an active site cavity in order to excise N3- or N7-alkylpurines from DNA.

AlkD traps and restructures destabilized base pairs
Recent work suggests that DNA glycosylases and oxidative demethylases detect damage by
using side chains to probe for free energy differences between normal and modified base
pairs 29–32. The lack of lesion-specific and DNA intercalating interactions in the AlkD/DNA
complexes implies that AlkD detects damage solely on the basis of DNA duplex
destabilization resulting from altered stacking or pairing of non-canonical base pairs. In
support of this, we crystallized the protein in complex with DNA containing a G•T
mismatch (Fig. 5a and Table S1), for which AlkD has no activity, but were unable to trap
the protein onto the same oligonucleotide containing a G•C or A•T base pair at this same
position. The resulting 1.5-Å AlkD/G•T-DNA structure is virtually identical to the
3d3mA•T complex (Table S1, Fig. S4). The similarity in these structures, together with
thermodynamic differences between modified and unmodified nucleobases, suggests that
AlkD detects these energetic differences as opposed to specifically recognizing the N3- or
N7-methyl groups (see Supplementary Information) 23,33–36.

Comparison of the G•T mismatch bound by AlkD and in the context of DNA alone provides
a basis for DNA damage recognition by AlkD (Fig. 5). In DNA, G•T wobble mismatches
form two Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds and are well stacked within the duplex 37 (Fig.
S10). AlkD restructures the G•T wobble so that the two bases protrude into opposite DNA
grooves, disrupting base stacking and leaving only a single hydrogen bond between guanine
N2 and thymine O4 (Fig. 5a). Superposition of a canonical G•T wobble onto the AlkD
structure revealed that the protein stabilizes this conformation by inducing a specific
distortion to the DNA backbone in order to alleviate steric clashes (Fig. 5b) and to create
optimal hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions at the DNA capture site (Fig.
S10). Thus, the enzyme detects non-Watson-Crick base pairs by resculpting the DNA
backbone to create an optimized protein-DNA binding surface. In both 3d3mA•T and G•T
complexes, specific protein-DNA contacts are mediated by Arg148-Asp113 and Arg190.
Substitution of any of these highly conserved residues reduces single-turnover rates of 7mG
excision by an order of magnitude (Fig. 5c), highlighting the importance of these
interactions to catalysis.

Base excision by solvent exposure
The specific structure of the DNA trapped in the AlkD complexes provides a rationale for
the enzyme’s specificity toward bases with a high propensity for depurination. We propose
the lesion capture mechanism facilitates base hydrolysis by increasing the lifetime that the
N-glycosidic bond is exposed to solvent, consistent with spontaneous depurination rates of
7mG in different DNA secondary structural contexts (see Supplementary Information).
However, the 100-fold rate enhancement of 7mG hydrolysis from duplex DNA by AlkD
cannot be explained on the basis of solvent exposure alone. Close inspection of the highly
distorted DNA backbone in the flipped abasic structure revealed that the deoxyribose ring is
positioned directly above a neighboring phosphate and that several water molecules bridge

this phosphate and the extrahelical deoxyribose C1′ carbon (Fig. S12a), raising the
possibility that the phosphate groups participate in catalysis. DNA-mediated water
positioning to facilitate hydrolysis is a plausible catalytic mechanism given the lack of a
requirement for a general base in these likely highly dissociative reactions. Alternatively,
electrostatic stabilization of an oxocarbenium intermediate by nearby phosphates, which has
been reported for uracil DNA glycosylase 38,39, offers a second possible mechanism for
DNA-stimulated catalysis.

Discussion
AlkD represents a novel glycosylase found in bacteria, archaea, plants and lower eukaryotes
(Fig. S1) 17. To our knowledge, most if not all of these organisms contain at least one other
alkylpurine DNA glycosylase, raising the question as to why an alternate mechanism has
evolved to eliminate genomic alkylation damage. The redundancy of alkylation repair may
provide enhanced protection to organisms faced with an onslaught of methylating agents.
Alternatively, AlkD may be a general DNA binding protein that coincidentally accelerates
hydrolysis of unstable N-glycosidic bonds, or, as speculated below, may play a supporting
role in general lesion detection.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AlkD’s activity toward bulky POB-DNA adducts normally associated with nucleotide
excision repair (NER) 40,41 may be indicative of a more generalized function of AlkD in
genome maintenance. AlkD’s lesion capture strategy is reminiscent of Rad4/XPC, which
recognizes cyclopyrimidine dimers by binding to the opposing nucleotides 42. Exposure of
the lesion away from the protein has the biological advantage of damage accessibility by the
rest of the NER machinery. The AlkD-product complex may provide a platform for
recruitment of a protein against the extrahelical abasic site, as seen in human APE1-DNA
complexes 43. It is intriguing to speculate that AlkD may participate in alternative repair
pathways by virtue of its ability to expose DNA damage. Indeed, non-enzymatic
alkyltransferase-like proteins were recently found to trigger NER of O6-alkylguanines by
inducing a specific protein-DNA complex, as illustrated by the crystal structure of ATL
bound to DNA containing O6-POB-dG 44.

The AlkD-DNA structures illustrate how HEAT repeats engage nucleic acids and, to our
knowledge, provide the first structural example of a HEAT motif with enzymatic activity.
Comparison with nuclear import factor importin β, which uses HEAT repeats to bind a
highly charged region of importin α 21 and Ran GTPase 22, demonstrates that the concave
surface of the HEAT domain is a generalized macromolecular binding platform. HEAT
repeats have been identified in chromatin-remodeling factors, including condensins,
cohesins, and some SWI2/SNF2 proteins 45, as well as DNA-damage response protein
kinases ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK 46. Recently, HEAT domains were visualized in EM and
crystal structures of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK 47,48, raising the possibility that other
structurally uncharacterized DNA processing enzymes utilize HEAT domains to bind DNA
in a manner similar to AlkD.

AlkD purification and crystallization
AlkD proteins were purified as described previously 19. Briefly, Bacillus cereus AlkD was
overexpressed as an N-terminal His6-SUMO-AlkD fusion protein in E. coli HMS174 cells
for 3 h at 37°C. AlkD was isolated using Ni-NTA (Qiagen) affinity chromatography,
followed by cleavage of the His6-SUMO tag and further purification by heparin affinity and
gel filtration chromatography. Protein was concentrated to 12.5 mg/mL and stored in 20 mM
Bis-Tris Propane, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT and 0.1 mM EDTA. Site-directed mutagenesis
of the wild-type AlkD vector was performed using a Quik-Change Kit (Stratagene), Mutant
proteins were overexpressed and purified identically to wild-type AlkD, and their structure
verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy.

AlkD/DNA complexes were assembled by incubating 0.45 mM protein and 0.54 mM
oligonucleotide for 15 min at 4°C. Oligonucleotide sequences used were
d(TGGG(THF)GGCTT)/d(AAAGCCYCCC), in which Y = thymine or cytosine, and
d(CGGACTXACGGG)/d(CCCGTTTCCG), in which X was either 3d3mA or G. AlkD/
THF-DNA crystals were grown at 16°C by mixing 2 µL protein/DNA complex with 2 µL
reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.1 mM NaCl, and 19% PEG 3350 and
2% glycerol. Crystals were soaked in 30% glycerol/reservoir solution for 1 min and flash
frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream. Crystals of 3d3mA-DNA and G•T-DNA complexes were
grown from reservoir solutions containing 85 mM NaAcetate pH 4.6, 170 mM ammonium
acetate, 25.5% PEG 4000, and 15% glycerol at 21°C, and were flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen directly from this solution.
X-ray Data Collection, Phasing, and Structure Refinement

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

X-ray data (Table S1) were collected at a wavelength of 0.97850 Å and 110 K at the
Advanced Photon Source beamlines 21-ID-D and 21-ID-G (LS-CAT) and processed with
HKL2000 50. Molecular replacement using unliganded AlkD (PDB ID 3BVS) as a search
model in Phaser 51 gave a clear solution for each structure. Following one round of
simulated annealing refinement in CNS 52, the entire DNA molecules could be discerned
and were built into 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density using XtalView 53. Atomic
coordinates and B-factors for the protein/DNA models were refined in Phenix 54. TLS
refinement with protein and each DNA chain defined as three separate TLS groups was
carried out for each model except the GT-complex. Individual anisotropic B-factors were
derived from the refined TLS parameters and held fixed during subsequent rounds of
refinement, which significantly decreased the crystallographic residuals and improved the
electron density maps. Instead of TLS refinement, individual anisotropic B-factors were
explicitly refined for the G•T-complex. Adjustments to the model, including addition of
solvent molecules, using Coot 55 were guided by manual inspection of 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc
electron density maps and were judged successful by a decrease in Rfree during refinement.
Protein and DNA models were validated using PROCHECK 56 and DNA parameters were
quantified using CURVES 5.2 57. All but one out of the total 223–231 protein residues
resided in the most favored (191–198 residues) or allowed (14–15 residues) regions of the

Enzyme Activity
Excision of 7mG by AlkD was measured by incubating the enzyme with a 25mer
oligonucleotide containing a centrally located 7mG and following the appearance of abasic
DNA product after alkaline cleavage. 7mG was enzymatically incorporated into DNA
duplexes using the previously described method 58, in which an oligonucleotide primer
[d(GACCACTACACC)] was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end, annealed to a 3-fold excess of the
complementary strand [d(GTTGTTAGGAAACGGTGTAGTGGTC)] and extended using
DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 2′-deoxy-7methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate (Sigma), dCTP, dTTP, and dATP. To create 7mG mispairs,
100-fold excess of complementary strand with T, G, A or pyrene in place of C at position 13
was reannealed to the 7mG containing oligonucleotide. Single-stranded 7mG containing
strands were obtained by reannealing to 100-fold excess of unlabeled lesion strand with G in
place of 7mG [d(GACCACTACACCGTTTCCTAACAAC)].

In a 10 µL glycosylase reaction, 100 nM [32P]-DNA duplex was incubated with 0–20 µM
AlkD in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, and 2 mM EDTA. The reaction
was quenched at various times by addition of 0.2 N NaOH and heated at 70°C for 2 min.
Substrate 25mer and product 12mer DNA strands were separated by denaturing 20%
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7 M urea and quantitated by autoradiography. Kinetic
data were analyzed by standard single-turnover techniques 59, which have been extensively
used for DNA glycosylases 60–65. Enzymatic rate constants (k) were obtained from singleexponential fits to the data (fP = 1 – e−kt, in which fP is the fraction of product). For
determination of the single-turnover rate constant, kst, AlkD was at least 5-fold in excess
over the K½ for a particular labeled DNA substrate (e.g., 5 µM for 7mG•C). For K½
determinations, the 7mG excision assay was performed over a range of enzyme
concentrations and K½ obtained by fitting the Michaelis-Menten plot with the equation, kobs
= Vmax[AlkD] / (K½ + [AlkD]). We note that our K½ for maximal activity may differ from
the Km value for multiple turnover because the Km can be affected by product release.
Stoichiometric 7mG excision was performed in the presence of 10 µM unlabeled 25mer
DNA duplex (K½ for this DNA was determined to be 0.9 ± 0.1 µM). Spontaneous rates of
7mG hydrolysis were determined using the sequence
d(GACCACTACACC(7mG)ATTCCTTACAAC) that had been re-annealed to 100-fold
excess complementary strand d(GTTGTAAGGAAT(C/T)GGTGTAGTGGTC).

NNKOAc-damaged DNA—Five milliliters DNA (2 mg/mL) dissolved in 100 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl was reacted with 1 mM
NNKOAc and esterase (200 units) at 37°C for 2 h. The reaction was diluted to 10 mL with
H2O and extracted with 10 mL CHCl3/iso-amyl alcohol (24/1) to remove the protein and 10
mL ethyl acetate to remove any unreacted NNKOAc. The DNA was precipitated by the
addition of 40 mL ethanol and washed twice 70% ethanol. Residual amounts of ethanol was
removed by rotary evaporation and the DNA was dissolved in H2O, aliquoted and stored at

and [Gua + H]+; O2-POB-Cyt, m/z 259.1 [M + 1] + to m/z 148.1 [POB]+; [pyridine-D4]O2POB-Cyt, m/z 263.1 [M + 1]+ to m/z 152.1 ([pyridine-D4]POB])+. Prior to HPLC-ESIMS/MS analysis of the samples the MS parameters were optimized for each deuterated POB
−DNA adduct standard. For analysis, the MS parameters were set as follows: Curtain gas, 40
psi; Ion spray voltage, 4 kV; source temperature, 650°C; nebulizer gas (GS1), 70 psi; heater
gas (GS2), 70 psi; and collision gas, 12 psi. The fragmentation potentials were optimized for
each ion: 299.1 and 303.1, declustering potential (DP), 65 V, entrance potential (EP), 10 V;
collision energy (CE), 20 V; collision cell exit potential (CXP), 12 V and for 259.1 and
263.1: DP, 40V; EP, 8V; EP, 15V; and CE, 6V. The amount of each POB−DNA adduct was
determined by comparing the MS peak area ratio of each adduct to its deuterated standard
with a calibration curve. Calibration standards were prepared by spiking different amounts
of each adduct with a constant amount of the corresponding internal standard in H2O and
then analyzed by LC-MS/MS without undergoing the sample preparation procedure
described above. The calibration curves were constructed by plotting concentration ratio vs
MS peak area ratios of each adduct to its deuterated standard.
DNA Binding
DNA binding was monitored by a change in fluorescence anisotropy as increasing
concentrations of protein were added to an oligonucleotide duplex that contained a THF
abasic modification in the middle of one strand
[d(TGACTACTACAT(THF)GTTGCCTACCAT)] and a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) on

the 3′-end of the complementary strand [d(ATGGTAGGCAACTATGTAGTAGTCA)FAM]. For stoichiometric binding measurements, increasing concentrations of protein (0–
200 µM) were added to a solution containing 50 nM FAM-DNA and 20 µM unlabeled
25mer DNA (Kd = 3.1 ± 0.3 µM) in 20 mM Bis-Tris propane pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM
DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA. Polarized fluorescence intensities using excitation and emission
wavelengths of 485 and 538 were measured at ambient temperature using a SpectraMax M5
microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Dissociation constants were derived by fitting a twostate binding model to data from three independent experiments.
