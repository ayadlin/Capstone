ABSTRACT
Purpose: To investigate if cetuximab induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and activation of cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) in the tumors of patients
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
Methods: Cetuximab was administered for two weeks prior to surgery to 20
treatment-naïve patients. Five untreated patients were included as controls. Tumor
biopsies were performed at baseline and before surgery. Gene expression profiles and
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the pre-and post-treatment biopsies
were compared. To further investigate EMT and CAF, correlations between previously
described EMT and CAF markers and our microarray data set were calculated.
Results : Gene expression profile analyses and qRT-PCR showed that some of the
genes modified by cetuximab were related to CAFs and EMT (ZNF521, CXCL12, ASPN,
OLFML3, OLFM1, TWIST1, LEF1, ZEB1, FAP). We identified 2 patient clusters with
different EMT and CAF characteristics. Whereas one cluster showed clear upregulation
of expression of genes implicated in CAF and EMT including markers of embryologic
pathways like NOTCH and Wnt, the other did not.
Conclusion: Even if EMT and CAFs are implicated in cetuximab resistance in preclinical models, we demonstrate for the first time that these molecular processes may
occur clinically early on.

INTRODUCTION

limit of tolerability [1]. Therefore, the investigation of new
targets, based on the biology of the disease, is of major
importance.
Cetuximab is recommended as treatment for
patients with locally advanced SCCHN. This chimeric
IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) specifically binds
to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with
high affinity. EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase

With an incidence of over 650.000 people per year,
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Despite
combined treatment in patients with stage III/IV SCCHN,
long-term survival rates remain low in advanced stages,
and chemoradiation regimens have reached their upper

receptor belonging to the HER/erbB family. Up to
90% of SCCHN express high levels of EGFR [2]. The
overexpression of EGFR and tumor growth factor-alpha
(TGF-α) is associated with poor prognosis [3, 4] and
radioresistance [3, 5].
Cetuximab improves the overall survival when
associated with radiation therapy in locally advanced
SCCHN, or with platinum-based chemotherapy in
incurable disease [6, 7]. However, with single agent
objective response rates between 6% and 13%, only a
minority of patients benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs [7,
8]. In contrast to colon cancer, where RAS mutations
predict treatment resistance [9], little is known about the
potential mechanisms of cetuximab resistance in SCCHN.
Hypotheses to explain anti-EGFR resistance include the
acquisition of oncogene activating mutations, activation of
alternative signaling growth pathways, or modifications in
tumor composition [10-12].
Components of the tumor microenvironment have
been implicated in treatment resistance and have been
shown to influence tumor growth and progression [13-15].
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process
in which cancer cells lose cell-to-cell adhesion and gain
invasive properties, has been described in preclinical
models, including SCCHN, as a possible mechanism
of EGFR therapy resistance [11]. Cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs), essential components of the tumor
microenvironment, may also modulate EGFR treatment
sensitivity and promote tumor growth [12]. Evidence of
this in real clinical situations is, however, lacking.
We have previously shown that pre-operative
administration of cetuximab in a window opportunity
study was safe and active [16]. We extended the study
to compare pre- and post-cetuximab tumor biopsies for
gene and protein expression. We show here that cetuximab
has a strong anti-tumoral effect, but that it also induces
significant modifications in the tumor that may promote
subsequent tumor growth and aggressiveness.

Initially, the impact of cetuximab on gene expression
was obtained through a global analysis of the Affymetrix
gene expression data with the aim of determining which
genes are differently expressed between the pre- and posttreatment biopsies, and in which biological processes
they are involved. The expression data from the baseline
biopsies (BC) and the operative biopsies (OC) was
compared. Only high quality samples were used for the
analysis (n = 19 before and n = 15 after cetuximab).
Upregulated genes, with at least two times higher mean
expression (delta >1) per group compared to the others,
were selected. Out of these, 284 Affymetrix spots were
significantly differentially expressed (P < 0.05) between
the BC and OC (Supplementary Table 1). The expression
of 96 genes (114 spots) upregulated in the BC compared
to the OC, and of 138 genes (170 spots) significantly
more highly expressed in the OC, was normalized and
visualized in Genesis (Figure 1A).
ClueGO [17] functional analysis revealed that
these genes were involved in pathways associated with
angiogenesis, epithelial cell proliferation, cell adhesion,
extracellular matrix organization, inflammatory response
and negative regulation of response to DNA damage
stimulus (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the 96 genes
downregulated by cetuximab were mainly associated with
epithelial cell proliferation, tissue morphogenesis, positive
regulation of angiogenesis, and nucleoside salvage. In
contrast, the 138 genes upregulated after cetuximab were
specifically involved in extracellular matrix organization,
cell adhesion and immune-related domains such as
inflammatory response, humoral immune response,
complement and coagulation cascade, and leukocyte
migration (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1A).
Among the genes differently expressed, 41 had a
strong fold change in their expression (an absolute fold
change of 1.8 i.e. 0.85 Log2 scale, and a corrected P for
multiple testing with a Benjamini-Hochberg test (BH)
below 5%).
Six of these genes were associated with
inflammation: ADAMDEC1, APOC1, C3, CD163, ACKR1,
VSIG4. Another 20 genes are known to be implicated in
cancer-related processes.
Some of these cancer-related genes were associated
with processes occurring in the extracellular matrix
and related to DCN: CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, SELP, vWF,
COL3A1, SCARA, SPARCL1. Other genes were related
to CAFs and EMT (ZNF521, CXCL12, ASPN, OLFML3,
OLFM1) (Supplementary Table 2).
Following cetuximab treatment, the overexpression
of selected genes related to either cancer stroma processes
or CAFs, and EMT, was confirmed by quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunochemistry (IHC). A
significantly higher expression of DCN (P = 0.0010),

RESULTS
Clinical results
Cetuximab was administered for two weeks prior to
surgery to 20 treatment-naïve SCCHN patients selected
for surgical treatment, as previously reported [16].
Ninety percent of the patients achieved a 18FDG-PET
response, but the majority had no significant macroscopic
tumor shrinkage. In patients treated with cetuximab,
histopathological analysis of the tumor specimens at
surgery showed reduced tumor cellularity, downregulation
of tumor proliferation and decreased phospho-EGFR
compared to untreated controls [16].

SPARCL1 (P = 0.0207), OLFM1 (P = 0.0010), OLFML3
(P = 0.0016), and CXCL12 (P = 0.0011) was observed
after cetuximab but not in the biopsies of the untreated
patients (data not shown). A good correlation was
obtained between the Affymetrix and qPCR measured
gene expression if the genes had a higher expression
than a Log2 intensity of 3 in the Affymetrix data (e.g. r
= 0.84 for OLFM1), confirming the reproducibility of the
microarray-based results. IHC staining on the resected
tumor specimens confirmed the upregulation of decorin in
the cetuximab treated group when compared to the control
group (P = 0.0068) (Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C). In
addition, we found inverse correlations between decorin
expression, measured by qRT-PCR or IHC, and the
residual tumor cellularity of the surgical specimens (r =
-0.64, P = 0.0006; and r = -0.55, P = 0.0067, respectively),
as well as with 18FDG/PET response, the primary
endpoint of our clinical trial (r = -0.50, P = 0.0120; and
r = -0.4380, P = 0.0207, respectively) (Supplementary
Figure 1D, 1E and 1F). P21WAF1/CIP1, a potent
inhibitor of cyclin-dependant kinases, has been shown to
be upregulated after the interaction between decorin and
EGFR. P21 overexpression was also demonstrated after
cetuximab by IHC (Supplementary Figure 1G) but was not
found in the untreated samples (data not shown).

the development and positive regulation of cell motility
(Figure 2E).
The expression of the EMT enriched genes was
heterogeneous in patients with a complete set of time
points (data not shown). The unsupervised clustering
of the fold increase or decrease in OC compared to BC
revealed two patient groups with different EMT pathway
related modifications. Overall, cluster 1 patients had a
significantly increased expression of EMT-related genes
(P < 0.0001), compared to cluster 2 patients. The fold
change visualization thus allowed the identification of
patient groups with similar changes in EMT-related
gene expression after cetuximab treatment (Figure 2F,
Supplementary Table 3). Statistically significant (P < 0.05)
gene modifications between both time points are shown in
Supplementary Figure 2a for all patient samples, and in
Figure 2G for patients cluster 1. Genes with a P - value in
between 0.05 and 0.1 are represented in Supplementary
Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2C, according to
cluster 1 and 2.
Interestingly, the same patient clusters were
obtained when analyzing the fold change of genes
known to be involved in the EMT pathway from Gene
Ontology (GO). Among these genes, Wnt pathway
(LEF1, TWIST1, SFRP2, WNT5A, DAB2), TGFβ pathway
(TGFB1I1, TGFB3, DAB2) and NOTCH1 pathway
(HEYL) related genes, as well as LOXL3 and NFATC1,
showed significantly increased expression after cetuximab
treatment in patients from cluster 1 (Figure 2H). DAB2,
LEF1 and TWIST1 were found in both the EMT enriched
and the EMT GO genes. Other genes implicated in
the NOTCH1 pathway (HAS2, HEY1, HEY2), the
WNT pathway (WNT2 and WNT4), and the TGFβ
pathway (TGFBR3), as well as HGF, showed increased
expression (P < 0.1) after treatment in cluster 1 patients
(Supplementary Figure 2D). In contrast, only few genes
had expression modification in cluster 2 (Supplementary
Figure 2E).
To validate these results and further investigate
EMT, additional analyses were performed by IHC.
E-cadherin and vimentin were immunohistochemically
stained on BC and OC biopsies of the cetuximab and
control groups. We observed a significant decrease in
E-cadherin expression and a significant increase in
vimentin in tumor cells in the cetuximab group but not
in the controls (data not shown), as semi-quantified
by histoscore (Figure 3A). Patient clusters were also
confirmed in this analysis; a decrease in E-cadherin and
an increase in vimentin were found only in tumors from
cluster 1 (Figure 3B, 3C).

Cetuximab induced EMT
In the second phase of this study, a detailed analysis
aimed at investigating the impact of cetuximab treatment
on the EMT process was performed. Seven genes,
known to be related to EMT in SCCHN (ZEB1, TWIST1,
TWIST2, LEF1, VIM, SNAI1 and SNAI2) [18, 19], were
analyzed. Their expression was normalized and visualized
in Genesis (Figure 2A). Interestingly, the known EMT
markers LEF1, TWIST1, and ZEB1, showed significantly
increased expression in post-treatment biopsies (Figure
2B). Increased expression in OC was observed for
TWIST2 and VIM. SNAI1 was minimally expressed in
the microarray (expression <3), and therefore filtered
out for further analysis. These results were confirmed by
qPCR in the BC and OC samples of cetuximab treated
and untreated patients. A significantly higher expression
was observed for TWIST1 (P < 0.05) (Figure 2C). To
investigate which other genes behave in a similar way
after cetuximab treatment, correlations between the six
selected EMT genes and all the other Affymetrix tested
genes were calculated with CluePedia [20]. The top 10
genes, with the highest correlation (r > 0.6) with each
of the six markers, were found to be enriching the EMT
known marker network (Figure 2D). Interestingly, DCN
was also found among the EMT enriched genes, which
positively correlated with TWIST1 (r = 0.83), TWIST2
(r = 0.83), ZEB1 (r = 0.76) and VIM (r = 0.65). ClueGO
functional analysis revealed that these genes are involved
in pathways relating to EMT, stem cell proliferation, and

Cetuximab induced activation of CAFs
To assess the impact of cetuximab on CAF-related
genes, a methodology similar to that for EMT was
applied. Six known CAF markers: ACTA2, CXCL12,

FAP, PDGFRB, S100A4 and TGFB1 [18] were analyzed,
and their expression was compared between BC and OC
(Figure 4A, 4B). A significantly increased expression in
OC was observed for FAP, with a similar trend for ACTA2,
CXCL12 and PDGFRB.
The expression of CXCL12 was further investigated
by qRT-PCR. A significantly upregulated CXCL12
expression was observed in the cetuximab group but not
in the controls, validating the microarray data (P = 0.004
respectively) (Figure 4C).
CAF enriched genes were further selected from
the genes with the strongest correlation with the CAF
markers, and were visualized together in a network
(Figure 4D). Correlations between PDGFRB and other
CAF-related genes were shown. Interestingly, ZEB1 was
part of both networks and correlated very well with many
EMT and CAF related markers. Genes showing similar
behaviour to the CAF markers after cetuximab treatment
were involved in pathways relating to wound healing, the
collagen metabolic process [21] and extracellular matrix
organization (Figure 4E), as revealed by the ClueGO
functional analysis.
Interestingly, the fold change of the CAF enriched
gene expression observed in paired OC and BC samples
identified the same patient clusters as obtained with the
EMT enriched genes (Figure 4F, Supplementary Table 4).
Statistically significant genes (P < 0.05) were represented
in Figure 4G for cluster 1 and in Supplementary Figure
3A for all patients. Genes with a similar trend are shown
in Supplementary Figure 3B and 3C, according to clusters
1 and 2.
Since GO does not yet provide a CAF-related

term gene association, a previously published CAF gene
signature defined in colon cancer was analysed [22].
Significantly differentially expressed genes are represented
in Figure 4H, and gene expression modifications with a
P < 0.1 are represented in Supplementary Figure 3D and
Supplementary Figure 3E.
CAF enriched genes were further analysed together
with a previously published stromal signature defined in
breast cancer [23]. Many of the CAF and stroma-related
genes were involved in the same biological functions
(Supplementary Figure 3F).
Strong correlations between EMT and CAF enriched
genes (r > 0.8) and markers (r > 0.6) were observed inside
the tumor (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B). Several
genes, such as ZEB1, ZEB2, FYN and LAMA4, were found
to be enriched in both EMT and CAF, suggesting similar
functional implications.
To further validate both patient clusters, we tested 4
previously described SCCHN molecular subtypes in our
microarray dataset [24]. Whereas most of the genes in the
OC biopsy of cluster 1 were related to the mesenchymal
phenotype, cluster 2 expressed genes related to the
atypical phenotype after the treatment (Supplementary
Figure 4C and 4D).

DISCUSSION
This «window study» provided a unique opportunity
to monitor the molecular modifications induced by
cetuximab in treatment-naïve patients with SCCHN.
Besides its antitumoral effect, we demonstrate here that
cetuximab induces major tumor modifications. These

modifications included genes and proteins implicated in
the extracellular matrix, linked with CAFs or related to
EMT.
We observed significant upregulation of decorin
expression, which may play a role in tumor control, as
suggested by the inverse correlations observed between
decorin expression and the residual tumor cellularity of the
surgical specimens. This small leucine-rich proteoglycan
may inhibit tumor cell growth, migration, angiogenesis
and metastasis [25, 26] by interaction with different
receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF [27, 28], other
erbB family members [29], c-Met [30] and IGF-1R [31]
and upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) via a p-53
independent pathway [32]. SPARCL1 (hevin), another
matricellular protein was also found to be upregulated
in our cetuximab treated tumors. This protein seems
to modulate the structure of the extracellular matrix by
regulating decorin levels and collagen fibril assembly [33].
Besides an increased expression of matrikines,
which may play a role in the control of tumor growth
and decreased tumor invasion, we observed tumor
modifications that may lead to tumor regrowth, or have
the potential to be implicated in cetuximab resistance. We
showed extracellular matrix modifications of the tumor and
upregulation of factors generally secreted by CAFs such as
CXCL12, ASPN [34] and OLFML3 [35, 36]. CAFs may
induce resistance to cetuximab [12]. Cetuximab-induced
growth inhibition was reduced in SCCHN cell lines cocultured with CAFs through CAF-derived soluble factors,
and CAF induced resistance to cetuximab was partly
abolished by matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors.
The upregulation of CXCL12 is of particular
interest. CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived
factor-1α, is the ligand of CXCR4. Activation of the
CXCR4/CXCL12 axis can lead to tumor proliferation
and can promote neoangiogenesis, cancer cell invasion
and metastasis, and EMT [37, 38]. Moreover, CXCR4
may have a role in cancer stem cells in SCCHN [39]. It
is also expressed on circulating tumor cells of metastatic
carcinoma and in melanoma patients [40]. Inhibitors of the
CXCR4/CXCL12 axis are currently under development
[41].
Furthermore, we showed high correlations between
the known CAF markers and other genes potentially
implicated in EMT, including a high correlation between
PDGFRB and LAMB1, and PDGFR and ZEB1. It has
been described that PDGF is required for the translation
of LAMB1 during EMT [42].
Finally, increased EMT has been shown to be
a potential mechanism of anti-EGFR resistance in
pre-clinical models [11, 43, 44]. We investigated the
expression of different EMT markers and showed that
some patients have upregulation of EMT markers after
cetuximab. We identified two groups with different EMT
characteristics. Whereas cluster 1 patients showed clear
upregulation of expression of multiple genes implicated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in EMT and embryologic pathways like NOTCH and Wnt,
cluster 2 patients did not show the same modifications in
gene expression. These findings may have therapeutic
implications since the addition of Wnt inhibitors to
EGFR inhibitors showed increased activity [45, 46] in
non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (NSCLC). Our study
showed increased expression of markers implicated in
the noncanonical frizzled2 pathway (SFRP2, WNT5A,
FYN), which has been recently identified by Gujral et al
[47]. Inhibition of this pathway, implicated in EMT and
cell migration, shows encouraging results on xenografts.
It is currently unknown whether cetuximab enriches
mesenchymal-like cells or promotes the transformation
of epithelial to mesenchymal cell types by EMT. The
correlation between DCN and EMT markers plays in favor
of the first hypothesis.
One limitation of our work is that only three doses
of cetuximab were given to avoid delaying standard
surgical curative treatment for ethical reasons. Our model
can therefore only investigate early occurring molecular
mechanisms. Other designs are needed to fully explore
the long-term acquired resistance mechanisms of antiEGFR monoclonal antibodies. Other limitations are the
low number of patients, a possible bias due to tumor
heterogeneity as well as the difficulties to perform more
precise protein validation of the gene expression profiles
due to the limited amount of tumor tissues we can collect
safely in a real clinical situation.
Our previous work and this study collectively
demonstrate that cetuximab reduces tumor cellularity
and induces modifications in the peritumoral
microenvironment of SCCHN. Even if EMT and CAFs
have shown to be possibly implicated in cetuximab
resistance in pre-clinical models, our data show that these
molecular processes may also occur very early on in the
clinic. Our work paves the way for further investigation of
novel therapies targeting these pathways in SCCHN.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Cetuximab was administered for two weeks prior to
surgery to 33 treatment-naïve patients (NCT00714649).
Five control patients were included. They were not treated
with cetuximab but were subject to the same biopsy and
imaging requirements. Details of the eligibility criteria,
pretreatment evaluation, safety, and clinical results have
been published [16]. The clinical and translational parts
of the study were approved by the Independent Ethics
Committee and the Belgian Health Authorities and
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
(October 2000). It was prospectively planned to perform
translational research and patients gave their informed

consent for repeated biopsies. For homogeneity, only the
patients included in the expansion part of the trial (n =
20) and the control patients (n = 5) were included in the
translational research reported here.

Based on the bioinformatic analysis quality control
procedure, no microarrays were removed. The dataset
was normalized using the GCRMA method. Normalized
expression levels are given in Log2 scale.

Tissue samples

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and real time quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR)

Tumor biopsies were taken from the middle of
the tumor surface at two different time points: (i) before
treatment, baseline condition samples (BC), and (ii) on the
day of surgery, operation condition samples (OC). At each
time point, one biopsy was stored in RNAlater® for up to
one week at 4°C and then frozen at -80°C, and another
was fixed in 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin.

Synthesis of first-strand cDNA for use in qRT-PCR
was carried out on 500 ng of total mRNA and subjected
to reverse transcription using SuperScript® III First-Strand
Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR, as described by the
manufacturer (Invitrogen).
The following predesigned TaqMan® gene
expression assays and TaqMan® Gene Expression Master
Mix were obtained from AB Applied Biosystems:
DCN (Hs00370384_m1), CXCL12 (Hs00171022_
m1), ZEB1 (Hs00232783_m1), OLFML3 (Hs00220180_
m1), p21 (Hs00355782_m1), TWIST1 (Hs00361186_m1),
TWIST2 (Hs00382379_m1), LEF1 (Hs01547250_m1).
Human glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (AB Applied Biosystems NM_002046.3) was
used as an internal control as previously described (20).
qRT-PCR was performed in a 10μl total reaction mixture
using a CFX96™ (Bio-Rad) thermal cycler. The thermal
cycling conditions were 50°C for two minutes followed by
95°C for 10 minutes, 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 60
seconds. The last two steps were repeated for 40 cycles.
Real-time PCR was performed in duplicate for each gene.
The qRT-PCR data was presented as delta Ct values
of the investigated genes relative to GADPH.
The fold change (2-ΔΔCt) in gene expression in
each paired sample was calculated using the formulas:
gene expression ΔCt = average gene expression Ct
minus average GADPH Ct; gene expression ΔΔCt =
gene expression ΔCt OC minus gene expression ΔCt BC.
Results were expressed in Log2 scale.

Immunohistochemistry and pathologic evaluation
Slides coming from tumor biopsies and the resected
tumor were haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained to
confirm the presence of viable tumor cells.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was
performed on 4-µm paraffin embedded tumor sections
for p21WAF (cell signaling, 1/75), E-cadherin (cell
signaling, 1/100) and vimentin (cell signaling, 1/100),
and on surgical specimens for decorin (R&D, 1/40). All
the stained slides were digitized by a slide scanner (Mirax
Scan; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The percentage of the
stained area was evaluated using Frida software (http://
bui3.win.ad.jhu.edu/frida). p21 and decorin expression
were subsequently quantified using an optical microscope
at 400x and 200x magnification, respectively. E-cadherin
and vimentin staining on tumor cells was blindly assessed
for each patient by histoscore as previously published [16].

RNA extraction and microarrays
Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini
Kit from Qiagen (Venlo, Netherlands).
After checking the concentration (NanoDrop),
yield and integrity (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer), RNA
samples of high quality (RNA integrity number (RIN) >
6, mean 8.1) were selected for gene expression profiling
by microarray. According to these criteria, one BC and
five OC biopsies were not analyzed by microarray. 250 ng
of RNA was amplified and labeled using the Affymetrix
GeneChip® 3’ IVT Express Kit. RNA was hybridized
overnight to Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus 2.0
(High Wycombe, UK), then stained and washed on an
Affymetrix Gene Chip® Fluidics Station 450. The array
was then scanned to produce an image data file (DAT) and
a cell intensities data file (CEL). A report file (RPT) was
generated and a chip data file (CHP) was generated from
the CEL file. The CEL file was then exported, ready for
importing the analysis.

Statistical methods
The normality of the data was tested using the
Shapiro-Wilk test. The Student’s t-test and the MannWhitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for pairwise
comparisons of parametric and non-parametric data,
respectively. Pearson and Wilcoxon correlations were
performed. A P - value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Benjamini-Hochberg method was used for
multiple testing correction.
Genes were mapped on Gene Ontology (GO),
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
and Reactome (data was downloaded on 01.02.2014) and
enriched (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni step-down correction),
non redundant pathways and terms were visualized in
ClueGO networks [17].

Using CluePedia [20], correlations between the
expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) markers and other
Affymetrix tested genes, were calculated. Genes with
the highest correlation were extracted and enriched the
EMT and CAF networks, respectively. The expression
difference in the OC compared to the BC was calculated
for the EMT and CAF markers and for the enriched genes.
The expression difference matrix was normalized and
clustered in Genesis (Kendall’s tau distance measurement,
Average Linkage).
