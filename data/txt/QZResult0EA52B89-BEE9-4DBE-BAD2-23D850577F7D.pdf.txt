Abstract
Survivin, a member of inhibitor of apoptosis family, is
associated with both prostate cancer progression and drug
resistance. Therefore, we hypothesized that survivin may play
a potentially important role in hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC) and bone metastatic disease; thus, targeting of
survivin signaling could enhance therapeutic efficacy in
prostate cancer. 3,3¶-Diindolylmethane (DIM) has been known
to have cancer chemoprevention activity. However, no
information is available regarding the down-regulation of
survivin by DIM, which could result in the chemosensitization
of HRPC cells to Taxotere-induced killing. We investigated the
effect of DIM alone or in combination with Taxotere using
LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. We observed that DIM
enhanced Taxotere-induced apoptotic death in both cell lines.
These enhancing effects were related to a decrease in survivin
expression as well as androgen receptor and nuclear factor-KB
(NF-KB) DNA-binding activity. We also found that knockdown
of survivin expression by small interfering RNA transfection
increased DIM-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis,
whereas overexpression of survivin by cDNA transfection
abrogated DIM-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis
in both prostate cancer cells. Importantly, luciferase assays
showed a significant reduction of survivin-Luc and NF-KB-Luc
activity in prostate cancer cells exposed to DIM and Taxotere.
Furthermore, combination treatment significantly inhibited
C4-2B bone tumor growth, and the results were correlated
with the down-regulation of survivin. From these results, we
conclude that inactivation of survivin by DIM enhanced the
therapeutic efficacy of Taxotere in prostate cancer in general,
which could be useful for the treatment of HRPC and
metastatic prostate cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4468–75]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death among men
in the United States (1). Almost all prostate cancer patients treated
with hormone ablation therapy develop hormone-refractory
prostate cancer (HRPC) and bone metastatic disease with functional androgen receptor (AR; refs. 2–7). Progression of prostate
cancer to androgen independence remains the primary barri-

cade in improving patient survival due to complex mechanisms
underlying the evolution to androgen independence, and at
present, there is no curative treatment for HRPC and bone
metastatic disease (3). Although the use of several different
agents resulted in pain relief in some patients, there was little
or no effect on survival. Therefore, an important challenge to
develop treatments that are more effective depend on our
understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) of prostate
cancer progression, which will help to identify many potential
therapeutic target genes that are involved in apoptosis, growth
factor, and cell signaling.
It is known that regulation of apoptosis has a central role in the
development of prostate cancer and its progression to an
androgen-independent state, which is, in part, due to up-regulation
of antiapoptotic genes after androgen deprivation (2, 3, 8–11).
Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP)
that is expressed at high levels in most human cancers and may
facilitate evasion from apoptosis and progression of prostate
cancer to an androgen-independent state (9, 12–15). Survivin is
also highly articulated in all major tumor types and its role in
metastasis remains unknown (9). Moreover, it is undetectable in
most normal differentiated tissues. Since a correlation exists
between high expression of survivin in tumors and poor survival
among patients with various cancers (16–18), survivin is considered a novel target in various cancer therapies (19). In this study,
we examined whether survivin could play a potentially important
role in HRPC and bone metastatic disease and studied whether
targeting the survivin pathway could enhance the therapeutic
efficacy.
There is increasing evidence suggesting that survivin is
associated with both progression of HRPC and resistance to
chemotherapy (9, 12, 13, 20, 21). Therefore, suppressing survivin
signaling may be a novel and effective therapeutic approach for
HRPC. Currently, no information is available regarding the
consequence of blocking survivin signaling, which may lower the
antiapoptotic threshold in cancer cells, thus sensitizing prostate
tumor cells to apoptosis. Several studies on survivin have revealed
that several existing anticancer drugs show survivin-suppressive
activity through various cell signaling pathways (22–24). However,
the safety and toxic profile for potential use of chemotherapeutic
agents, particularly for cancer chemotherapy, are major concerns
for their efficacy. Thus, there is a dire need for the development of a
novel and specific anti-survivin therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of HRPC.
Previous studies have shown that 3,3¶-diindolylmethane (DIM),
a major in vivo acid-catalyzed condensation product of indole3-carbinol, is thought to have protective effects against the
development of human prostate cancer as well as breast cancer
(11, 25–28). DIM is known to act as a potent inducer of

DIM-Induced Down-regulation of Survivin

Figure 1. Effect of DIM and Taxotere on prostate cancer cell growth. For single-agent treatment, prostate cancer cells were treated with DIM (10, 30, or
40 Amol/L) or Taxotere (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 nmol/L) alone for 72 h (A and B, left and middle ). For combination, prostate cancer cells were treated with 30 Amol/L DIM
and then exposed to 1.5 nmol/L Taxotere for 72 h (A and B, right ). DIM in combination with Taxotere significantly inhibited cell proliferation in LNCaP (A, right ) and
C4-2B (B, right ) prostate cancer cells as measured by MTT assay. Data from three individual experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

apoptosis associated with down-regulation of Akt/nuclear factornB (NF-nB) and survivin in breast cancer cells (11, 26). It has
also been indicated that HRPC is an aggressive and treatmentresistant disease and the pharmacologic therapeutic approach
for this disease has previously shown limited efficacy (29, 30).
Moreover, the function of DIM in HRPC therapy is unknown. In
spite of the knowledge of DIM as a cancer chemopreventive
agent, understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) of action by
which DIM targets prostate cancer and its role in cancer therapy
is lacking. Several molecular mechanism(s) that could be related
to the multiple gene alterations observed in advanced prostate
cancer are involved in the transition toward an androgenindependent state, including changes in cell growth and
antiapoptotic factors such as Akt/NF-nB and survivin (31, 32).
In HRPC, enhanced function of AR, together with the activation
of Akt/NF-nB pathways, also promotes cancer cells to become
resistant to androgen deprivation therapy (31, 32). In addition,
previous studies have shown that androgen could induce
oxidative stress resulting in the production of reactive oxygen
species, which in turn could activate NF-nB and contribute to
the induction of cell growth during the development or
progression of prostate cancer (33). However, the downregulation of survivin via inactivation of AR and NF-nB signaling
by DIM could be an important strategy for the treatment of
prostate cancer, especially for HRPC. The present options for

www.aacrjournals.org

treating metastatic prostate cancer are limited to surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy or combined modality
therapy. Commonly used anticancer agents for the treatment of
HRPC do not result in clinically meaningful responses in most
prostate cancer patients, suggesting the need for a combination
therapy (34). In this study, we examined whether DIM increases
apoptotic cell death, thereby inactivating survivin leading to
chemosensitization of HRPC cells to Taxotere-induced killing
using both LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cells, which is
more similar to human HRPC. Here, we report the mechanistic
role of a nontoxic dietary chemopreventive agent, DIM, for the
treatment as well as enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of
Taxotere for prostate cancer in general but most importantly for
HRPC and bone metastatic disease. We believe that targeting
survivin by DIM could be a novel approach for the treatment of
HRPC and bone metastatic disease.

anti-human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (Biomol), antiNF-nB p65 (Upstate), and anti-h-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies were
used for Western blot analysis. All secondary antibodies were obtained from
Pierce. Taxotere (Aventis Pharmaceuticals) was dissolved in DMSO to make
a 4 Amol/L stock solution.
Cell proliferation inhibition studies by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. LNCaP and C4-2B
prostate cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the cells
were treated with 10, 30, and 40 Amol/L DIM followed by treatment of
Taxotere with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 nmol/L for 24 to 72 h. After treatment, the cell
growth studies were done by MTT as described earlier (26, 27).
Histone/DNA ELISA for detection of apoptosis. The cytoplasmic
histone/DNA fragments from prostate cancer cells treated with 10 or 30
Amol/L DIM followed by treatment of Taxotere with 1.0 or 1.5 nmol/L for
24, 48, or 72 h were extracted and the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit
(Roche) was used to detect apoptosis in prostate cancer cells as described
earlier (11, 26, 27).
Western blot analysis. Prostate cancer cells were treated with DIM at
various concentrations for different times followed by treatment with and
without Taxotere for 72 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and protein
concentrations were then measured using the Bio-Rad assay system
(Bio-Rad). Total proteins were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting as described
earlier (11, 26, 27).
NF-KB DNA-binding activity measurement. Prostate cancer cells were
plated at a density of 1  106 in 100 mm dishes and cultured for 72 h.
Subsequently, the cells were treated as described above. The total proteins
and the nuclear proteins were extracted and subjected to Western blot
analysis for survivin, AR, and NF-nB p65 and electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) for NF-nB DNA-binding activity by Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System using NF-nB IRDye-labeled oligonucleotide (L1-COR, Inc.) as
described earlier (26, 27, 35). Using frozen tumor tissues, nuclear proteins
were also extracted as described previously (26, 27, 35).
Plasmids and transfection. Prostate cancer cells were transfected with
survivin small interfering RNA (siRNA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
survivin cDNA, respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 (11). The transfected
cells were treated with 30 Amol/L DIM for 48 or 72 h. The cell growth and
apoptotic cell death of transfected cells with and without treatments were
measured using MTT assay and ELISA, respectively.
Luciferase assay. NF-nB-Luc (Stratagene) and survivin-Luc (plasmid
containing 1,430 bp survivin promoter with luciferase coding sequence;
Health Research) were transfected into C4-2B cells using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen) for 24 h followed by treatment with DIM (30 Amol/L), Taxotere
(1.5 nmol/L), and DIM plus Taxotere for 24 h. Luciferase activities in the
samples were measured following the procedures as described earlier (36).
CMV-h-gal reporter construct transfection was used for normalization of
transfection efficiency.
Animal studies. The severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)human prostate cancer and breast cancer model of experimental bone
metastasis was used for our study as described earlier (37–39). Briefly,
suspensions of C4-2B cells were injected intraosseously by insertion of a
27-gauge needle through the mouse (Taconic Farms) skin directly into
the marrow surface of the previously implanted bone (38, 39). The mice
were divided into four groups of 6 to 8 animals in each group. Group I
was assigned as control and group II mice were given DIM (3.5 mg/d/
animal; refs. 11, 26–28). In addition, the mice from group III received
three doses of Taxotere (5 mg/kg body weight given intravenously)
every 72 h after 24 h DIM gavaging (39, 40). Group IV was exposed to
DIM and treated with Taxotere as shown for groups II and III. The mice
in the intervention groups were given DIM by oral gavage every day for
5 weeks. The volume of the bone tumor in each group was determined
by weekly caliper measurements according to the formula: ab 2/2, where
a is length and b is cross-sectional diameter. The mice were sacrificed
10 to 11 weeks after cell injection.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissue collection, fixation, and
H&E and immunohistochemical staining were done according to the
methods as described earlier (26, 38, 39).

Statistical analysis. Data are represented as mean F SD for the absolute
values or percent of controls as indicated in the vertical axis legend of
Figs. 1 to 3. The statistical significance of differential findings between
experimental groups and control was determined by Student’s t test as
implemented by Excel 2000 (Microsoft) and GraphPad StatMate software
(GraphPad Software). P < 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.

Figure 2. Increased apoptotic response was evident in the combination
treatment group relative to untreated control or single-agent–treated group as
measured by ELISA (A ). Western blot analysis showed that DIM in combination
with Taxotere (Tax) significantly decreased the expression of survivin,
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP ), AR, prostate-specific antigen (PSA ),
FoxM1, caspase-3, and NF-nB p65 (B ). DIM and Taxotere inhibited the activity
of NF-nB in prostate cancer cells as measured by EMSA (C ). Retinoblastoma

DIM sensitizes prostate cancer cells to Taxotere-induced
growth inhibition. We found that treatment of prostate cancer
cells by DIM and Taxotere caused 45% to 65% growth inhibition
(Fig. 1A and B, left and middle). However, DIM in combination with
a lower dose of Taxotere resulted in 85% to 90% growth inhibition
in both prostate cancer cells, suggesting the greater inhibitory
effect of combination treatment (Fig. 1A and B, right). These results
show that combination of DIM along with a lower dose of Taxotere
elicits significantly greater inhibition of cancer cell growth
compared with either agent alone. The lower dose of Taxotere in
inhibiting cell growth when combined with a nontoxic dietary
chemopreventive agent (DIM) will have significant ramification for
extending our studies for human prostate cancer treatment.
DIM sensitizes prostate cancer cells to Taxotere-induced
apoptosis. By apoptotic cell death ELISA analysis, we found that
30 Amol/L DIM combined with lower dose of Taxotere induced
greater apoptosis in prostate cancer cells compared with singleagent treatment (Fig. 2A). We also observed that DIM and Taxotere
combination treatment in vitro produced stronger PARP cleavages
compared with monotreatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the
combination treatment could induce greater apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells. Using Western blot analysis, we found that DIM
alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents downregulated the expression of survivin, AR, prostate-specific antigen,
FoxM1, and NF-nB p65 in both prostate cancer cells (Fig. 2B).
The combined treatment of DIM and Taxotere also resulted in
an increase of caspase-3 activation in both prostate cancer cells
(Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the cell growth
inhibition observed by MTT assay, suggesting that greater cell
growth inhibition resulting from the combination treatment is
partly mediated through the increased induction of apoptosis in
prostate cancer cells.
DIM inhibits activation of NF-KB. Treatment with DIM
resulted in a decreased NF-nB activity in both prostate cancer
cells as shown in Fig. 2C (left and right). Interestingly, the
combination of DIM and Taxotere showed inactivation NF-nB in
both prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 2C). These results show that
DIM not only down-regulates the NF-nB activity but also inhibits
NF-nB even more in the presence of a lower concentration of
Taxotere, which could be responsible for better cell killing by
combination treatment.
Down-regulation of survivin expression by siRNA transfection promotes DIM-induced cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis. We found that treatment of cells with DIM or survivin
siRNA alone for 72 h generally caused 60% to 70% of growth
inhibition in prostate cancer cells compared with control. However,
DIM plus survivin siRNA resulted in f90% growth inhibition
compared with control (Fig. 3A, left). Survivin siRNA-transfected
prostate cancer cells were significantly more sensitive to spontaneous and DIM-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A, right). These results
suggest that DIM plus survivin siRNA promotes cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis to a greater degree compared with either
agent alone.
Overexpression of survivin by cDNA transfection reduces
DIM-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Overexpression of survivin by cDNA transfection rescued DIM-induced
cell growth inhibition and abrogated DIM-induced apoptosis to a
certain degree (Fig. 3B, left and right). We found that treatment of
cells with survivin cDNA for 48 h promotes 80% to 90% of cell

growth in prostate cancer cells compared with control. However,
DIM plus survivin cDNA resulted in 35% to 50% growth inhibition
compared with cDNA alone (Fig. 3B, left). These results provide
evidence for a potential role of survivin during DIM-induced cell
growth inhibition and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.
DIM suppresses survivin gene transcription mediated by
inhibition of NF-KB activity. Luciferase assays showed an
increase in activity of prostate cancer cells transfected with
survivin-Luc or NF-nB-Luc. In contrast, our results (Fig. 3C) clearly
show that luciferase activity in survivin-Luc–transfected or NF-nBLuc–transfected cells were significantly decreased in combination
treatment. These results further showed that the down-regulation
of survivin expression by DIM is a transcriptional event.
DIM enhances in vivo therapeutic efficacy of Taxotere. We
found that DIM as well as Taxotere alone inhibited the C4-2B
tumor growth within the bone environment to some extent.
Interestingly, the combination of DIM and Taxotere showed 80%
inhibition in tumor growth relative to control, showing the
enhanced inhibitory effect of DIM and Taxotere combination in
our model (Fig. 4A). We measured the DNA-binding activity of NFnB and two of its target genes, such as survivin, AR, and NF-nB p65,

within tumor tissues. Our results clearly show that survivin and its
effector genes, such as AR, NF-nB p65, and NF-nB activity, were
significantly down-regulated in specimens obtained from the
combination group (Fig. 4B and C). These in vivo results were
similar to our in vitro findings, suggesting that the inactivation of
survivin is at least one of the molecular events by which the drug
combination potentiates antitumor activity in our experimental
model.
Tumor histology. The histology of the tumor in all sections was
similar, each consisting of a high-grade carcinoma with only focal
areas indicative of adenocarcinoma differentiation (Fig. 5A). Our
findings suggest reduction in the percentage of viable tumor mass
from the control to the treatment group, particularly for the
combination treatment (Table 1). Also, extensive bone destruction
with areas of bone remodeling/new bone formation was particularly evident in the control group (Fig. 5A) but not as apparent in
the treatment groups. All of the treatment groups, especially in the
combination treatment group (Fig. 5A; Table 1), showed a higher
percentage of bony tissue compared with the control group in
which the bony elements were almost completely destroyed/absent
(Fig. 5A; Table 1).

Figure 4. A, under the experimental conditions, combined treatment (DIM and Taxotere) caused an 80% reduction in tumor volume compared with control group (A,
left). Comparison of the tumor volumes in each group on the day when all mice were sacrificed (A, right ). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. The total proteins and the nuclear
proteins were extracted from randomly selected frozen tumor tissues obtained from each treatment group of animals and subjected to Western blot and EMSA,
respectively (B and C ). These results showed that DIM and Taxotere were effective in down-regulating survivin, AR, NF-nB p65, and NF-nB in tumors from treated
animals relative to tumors from control animals (B and C ).

DIM-Induced Down-regulation of Survivin

combination of DIM and Taxotere showed greater degree of
down-regulation of AR (Fig. 5B) and survivin (Fig. 5C). Overall, our
results suggest that the DIM and in combination with Taxotere may
indeed reduce the levels of AR and survivin, which is mediated by
the inactivation of NF-nB in the tumor microenvironment resulting
in antitumor activity in our experimental model of prostate cancer
bone metastasis.

Discussion

necrosis, fibrosis, and bony elements (DIM ). Similar to DIM, the section shows
partially viable tumor with a combination of acute hemorrhagic necrosis, fibrosis,
and bony elements (Taxotere ). The combined group shows a relatively lower
percentage of viable tumor, more bony elements, and predominantly organizing
necrosis/fibrosis (DIM +Tax ). Immunohistochemical staining for AR (B ) and

Taxotere-treated group showing weaker staining of AR (B) and survivin (C ).

Analysis of survivin and AR expression by immunohistochemistry. The expression of AR (Fig. 5B) and survivin (Fig. 5C)
was significantly decreased in C4-2B bone tumors in SCID-hu mice

There is collective evidence suggesting that survivin is a strong
apoptosis inhibitor, the expression of which is increased in
aggressive prostate cancer compared with normal tissue (9, 12,
13, 21). Therefore, down-regulation of survivin mediated by the
inactivation of NF-nB could be an important approach for devising
novel therapeutic strategies for HRPC. Our data showed that DIM
treatment in combination with Taxotere caused significant
induction of apoptosis by down-regulation of survivin in prostate
cancer cells. Several studies have suggested that the activation of
NF-nB, a transcription factor, regulates hundreds of genes, such as
survivin, which is critically involved in apoptosis (41). In this study,
we also observed a drastic reduction of survivin and NF-nB DNAbinding activity in prostate cancer cells exposed to DIM and
Taxotere. These results suggest that DIM may down-regulate
survivin through NF-nB-mediated transcriptional inactivation,
thereby inactivating AR, leading to apoptotic cell death and
chemosensitization of HRPC cells to Taxotere.
Apoptosis is one of the most vital pathways through which
chemopreventive agents inhibit the overall growth of cancer cells.
Thus, it is important to investigate whether inhibition of cell
proliferation and induction of apoptosis by any chemopreventive
agents are associated with the down-regulation of antiapoptotic
genes, such as survivin, which plays a critical role in prostate cancer
cell progression (12, 13). It has also been shown that expression of
survivin is associated with cancer cell viability and chemoresistance,
which could be eliminated by chemopreventive agents (22, 42, 43).
Naturally occurring dietary compounds found in cruciferous
vegetables such as DIM have gained considerable attention as
cancer chemopreventive agents. Previously, our laboratory as well
others have shown a novel function of DIM, which induced apoptosis
concomitant with down-regulation of survivin that could be due to
the inactivation of Akt/NF-nB signaling in breast and prostate
cancer cells (11, 25–28). In the present study, our results showed that
DIM and Taxotere, as single agents, did induce apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells as documented by ELISA and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase cleavage assay, in conjunction with a more significant
inhibition of cell growth as observed by MTT assay. However,
treatment of cells with DIM in combination with a lower dose of
Taxotere resulted in a significantly greater induction of apoptosis
associated with the down-regulation of survivin in prostate cancer
cells. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of AR,
prostate-specific antigen, FoxM1, caspase-3, and NF-nB p65 were
also down-regulated after DIM treatment. These results suggest that
more significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth was
caused by a low dose of combination treatment, which is mediated
by the increased induction of apoptosis, acting through the
inactivation of the protein survivin.
Recent evidence also indicates that the overexpression of
survivin in tumors is associated with poor prognosis and increased
tumor recurrence because it may overcome the G1-S checkpoint
imposing progression of cells through cell cycle conferring
proliferative advantage (9, 12–15, 19). In addition to its role in

inhibiting apoptosis, survivin also interacts with the mitotic spindle
(19, 44), which has been implicated as being essential for its
antiapoptotic function (19). DIM per se was effective in downregulating survivin in prostate cancer cells as well as inducing G1-S
cell cycle arrest (45, 46). Based on our findings, one may speculate
and argue that DIM in combination with Taxotere treatment may
be effective in blocking cell cycle progression in the G1-S phase
resulting from DIM-induced inhibition of survivin that leads the
cells to undergo apoptosis (19, 44, 46). This highlights yet another
important molecular mechanism of action of DIM in enhancing the
therapeutic efficacy of cytotoxic agents because G1-S cell cycle
arrest has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for cancer
therapy (19, 45, 46).
As documented previously, NF-nB found in prostate cancer cells
may cause survival by inhibiting apoptosis. NF-nB also regulates
the expression of a large number of genes that play critical roles in
apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, various autoimmune
diseases, and inflammation (47). Several studies have suggested
that the activation of NF-nB up-regulates survivin gene expression,
which protects cells from apoptosis (41, 48). Consistent with
existing reports in the literature documenting that NF-nB induces
survivin gene expression, we evaluated NF-nB activity to determine
the mechanism(s) of increased apoptosis induced by DIM and
Taxotere. Our results showed that DIM inhibited the expression of
NF-nB activity, whereas Taxotere showed a lesser degree of
apoptosis, supporting the observation that NF-nB causes inhibition
of apoptosis, which is associated with up-regulation of survivin. It
has been indicated that the survivin promoter region contains
binding sites of several transcription factors such as NF-nB (49, 50).
We hypothesized that DIM may inhibit the binding reaction of NFnB in the survivin promoter region and inhibits transcription of the
survivin gene. However, to further explore the inhibitory effects of
DIM between survivin and NF-nB, we conducted transfection with
a luciferase construct. Luciferase assays showed a significant
reduction of survivin-Luc and NF-nB-Luc activity in prostate
cancer cells exposed to DIM and Taxotere compared with control
transfections where cells were transfected with empty vectors. In
this study, we also found that down-regulation of survivin by
survivin siRNA together with DIM treatment caused cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis to a greater degree in prostate cancer cells
compared with either agent alone. On the other hand, overexpression of survivin by survivin cDNA transfection abrogated
DIM-induced apoptosis to a certain degree. Therefore, we strongly
believe that down-regulation of survivin mediated by the inhibition
of NF-nB is mechanistically linked with DIM and Taxotere-induced
cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.

To test whether DIM has any antitumor effects in vivo and
whether survivin is inactivated and correlated with down-regulation
of NF-nB and induction of apoptotic cell death, we conducted an
animal experiment using a xenograft model of experimental prostate
cancer bone metastasis. We found that treatment of C4-2B prostate
cancer cells with DIM sensitizes these cells to Taxotere, which could
be mechanistically related to down-regulation of survivin and
inactivation NF-nB DNA-binding activity in tumor tissues. Our
present observation also showed that the maximum degree of
necrosis occurred in DIM plus Taxotere treatment group. These
results further support the conclusion that inhibition of survivin
activation promotes Taxotere-induced apoptosis in vivo. In our
immunohistochemical analysis, the expression of survivin and AR,
two important molecules of tumor cell survival and metastasis, were
significantly decreased in C4-2B bone tumors in SCID-hu mice
receiving the DIM and Taxotere compared with control. In general,
our in vitro and in vivo results showed that the utilization of a dietary
agent DIM alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents could be useful for the treatment of prostate cancer in general
but most significantly for the treatment of hormone-refractory and
metastatic prostate cancer. Importantly, our observations from
preclinical animal model and in vitro studies revealed downregulation of survivin as well as AR and NF-nB in sensitization
experiments, which may be effective in contributing to the
potentiation of Taxotere cytotoxicity by DIM. These observations
on alterations in the expression status of survivin by DIM are of
considerable importance, which strongly suggests that DIM
sensitizes the prostate cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of
chemotherapeutic drugs.
In conclusion, the combination treatment significantly inhibited
tumor cell growth, induced apoptosis, and inhibited the growth of
experimental C4-2B cells in the bone microenvironment in our
SCID-hu model of human prostate cancer bone metastasis. Our
present findings suggest that DIM may function as an inhibitor of
survivin signaling directly or indirectly due to the inactivation of AR
and NF-nB, ultimately causing cell growth inhibition and induction
of apoptosis, which may lead to chemosensitization of HRPC cells to
Taxotere. Therefore, we believe that down-regulation of survivin and
NF-nB signaling, thereby inactivating AR by DIM, could be a novel
approach for sensitizing prostate cancer cells to Taxotere. Taken
together, the results from our in vitro as well as in vivo experiments
clearly suggest that the combination of DIM and Taxotere could be a
potential regimen for the treatment of patients diagnosed with
prostate cancer, especially HRPC and bone metastatic disease in the
future. Further in-depth testing of combinations of various drugs
with DIM are needed in support of designing mechanism-based
