Factor"

The Era of Angiogenesis
In a seminal publication by Dr. Judah Folkman (1), the
concept of tumor angiogenesis via the identiﬁcation of a then
undeﬁned tumor angiogenesis factor transformed oncology
research and drug development by redirecting efforts towards
a new horizon, where novel angiogenesis inhibitors held promise in the ﬁght against cancer.
Dr. Judah Folkman is heralded as the "Father of Angiogenesis,"
yet he was not the ﬁrst to recognize the abnormal angiogenesis
process in tumors. In a review by Stephenson and colleagues (2),
we are reminded of the scientiﬁc notables from the 1700s to the
early 1900s who observed vascularization in tumors and under
proangiogenic experimental conditions. However, the 1974
publication (1) and subsequent exploration by Dr. Folkman and
his colleagues in the period of booming biotechnology resulted in
a cascade of research, which led to a deeper understanding of the
multicellular nature of tumor biology.
The hypothesis of tumor dormancy and of the vascular requirement to fuel tumor growth beyond a few millimeters via an
"angiogenic switch" was supported by the results of several key
experiments:
*

*

avascular growth of a tumor in an isolated, perfused organ but
that rapidly grew when the tumor was transplanted into the
host animal;
dormant tumors in the anterior chamber of the rabbit eye that
rapidly grew when placed against the iris;
tumor spheroids unable to reach a size greater than a mean
diameter of 2–3 mm in culture;
tumor development in the chorioallantoic membrane after
capillaries penetrated the tumor nodule.

These assays may appear rather elementary and unsophisticated compared to today's genetic engineering, molecular proﬁling,
and in vivo imaging modalities. However, these results signiﬁcantly impacted preclinical and clinical research to follow.
Dr. Folkman championed the concept that host tissue impacts
the tumor microenvironment and subsequent malignancy through
the development of blood vessels. The discovery of the VEGF (3, 4),
VEGF family (VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, PlGF-1, and -2), associated
isoforms, ligands, and VEGF receptors (VEGFR) rapidly ensued.
The lymphangiogenesis process was uncovered. The importance of
tumor hypoxia and inﬂuence on therapeutic resistance become
increasingly apparent (5). Pericytes, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial

progenitor cells, and cells of hematopoietic lineage soon joined
endothelial cells as recognized cellular components of the tumor
microenvironment milieu. Angiogenic cytokines and their corresponding receptors were included in the party. The emerging
concepts of angiogenesis versus vasculogenesis (3), vascular normalization (6), vessel co-option (7), vasculogenic mimicry (8), and
metronomic chemotherapy (9) opened up the ﬁeld to a new era of
discovery, technological advances, and healthy debates.
The increasing acceptance of the role that the VEGF pathway
plays in tumor angiogenesis eventually paved the way for a new
class of anticancer drugs. One of the earliest proof of concepts of
the potential of antiangiogenic drugs was a VEGF-speciﬁc mAb,
which inhibited the growth of and vessel density in tumors, but
had no effect on tumor cell growth rate in vitro (10). These
observations eventually led to the clinical development and
approval of the ﬁrst antiangiogenic drug, bevacizumab, for metastatic colorectal cancer in 2004, 30 years after Dr. Folkman's
publication on tumor angiogenesis factor in Cancer Research.
There have since been approvals of additional angiogenesis
inhibitors: small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting
VEGFR(s) (axitinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib); protein therapeutics
directed against VEGFR2 or VEGF/PlGF (ramucirumab and zivaﬂibercept, respectively); and small-molecule mTOR inhibitors
(everolimus and temsirolimus). Several other drugs known to
possess antiangiogenic properties were approved to treat cancer
although the precise mechanisms of action are not well understood. Thalidomide was one such drug; shelved due to birth
defects in the 1950s and 1960s, it was repurposed to treat multiple
myeloma after its antiangiogenic properties became known (11).
The genesis of antiangiogenic therapy was met with much
enthusiasm and excitement, followed by press coverage, which at
times became rather sensational. Rumors of a cure reached new
heights, but Dr. Folkman quickly discounted such claims, stating "if
you have cancer and you are a mouse, we can take good care of you"
(12). This quote still rings true today. Antiangiogenesis therapy has
had some successes but also its fair share of disappointment. The
clinical beneﬁt is typically modest, toxicity occurs, acquired resistance emerges, and the biomarker(s) that will predict which
patients will respond to VEGF-targeted therapy remains elusive.
However, despite these shortcomings, many of these antiangiogenics are routinely administered as standard of care in the clinic as
they can extend survival times and/or delay disease progression.
On this 75th anniversary of Cancer Research, let's reﬂect back on
the pioneering work of Dr. Judah Folkman with gratitude for his
outstanding scientiﬁc achievements, cherished mentorship, and
tireless dedication to improving the lives of cancer patients.
