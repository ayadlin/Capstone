Reporting Time-to-Event Endpoints
and Response Rates in 4 Decades of
Randomized Controlled Trials in
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Hendrik-Tobias Arkenau, PhD; Ina Nordman, MBBS; Timothy Dobbins, PhD; and Robyn Ward, PhD

BACKGROUND: Reporting of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) often is suboptimal. Cancer drug trials are
complicated further by multiple survival and response endpoints. The authors of this report determined the frequency
of reporting of time-to-event endpoints and tumor response outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer and examined
the relation between the year of publication and the reported effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil or equivalent agents.
METHODS: A literature search identified 144 RCTs that involved 35,853 patients. The patient characteristics, trial
designs, and methods for endpoint reporting were extracted. The clinical effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil or equivalent
agents was analyzed in 3 time periods (pre-1990, 1990s, and 2000s) in 28,636 patients. RESULTS: One hundred
twenty-nine trials (90%) reported overall survival (OS) and response rates; whereas time to progression (44%), duration of response (43%), progression-free survival (22%), and time to treatment failure (12%) were reported less frequently. Except for stable and progressive disease, the frequency of reporting of endpoints did not improve over the
period studied. The median OS for patients who received 5-fluorouracil or equivalent agents increased significantly
(from 9.4 months before 1990 to 13.5 months after 2000). During the same period, the rate of stable disease
increased (38.2%, 40.5%, and 45.1% for pre-1990, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively; P ¼ .004); whereas the rate of progressive disease decreased significantly (39.2%, 33.3%, and 27.8%, respectively; P ¼ .002). CONCLUSIONS: Its likely
that the increasing availability of alternative treatments and better supportive care improved OS, whereas the rates
of stable and progressive disease altered because of changes in follow-up schedules. Other intermediate endpoints
(duration of response and time to progression) remained largely constant over the time course of the current study,

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the undisputed gold standard for establishing drug safety and efficacy. To

address well recognized deficits in reporting of trials,1 the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
Statement was developed in 1996,2 updated in 20013 and refined in 2010.4,5 Completion of the CONSORT checklist is
designed to improve the transparency, accuracy, and completeness of trial reporting. In doing so, it is envisaged that the
public will be better placed to appraise the health impact of a new therapy. Several studies have examined the impact of
CONSORT in disease types6,7 or more generally.8,9 Only a few studies have evaluated the scientific quality of RCTs in
cancer,10-14 and, to our knowledge, there are no studies in colorectal cancer. Modest improvements have been demonstrated in some areas, for example, increased use of intention-to-treat analysis.11 However, all of those studies concluded
that the quality of trial reporting remains suboptimal despite the widespread promulgation of the CONSORT statement.
In terms of the results component of the checklist, CONSORT requires a flow diagram, the period of recruitment, baseline data, and the outcomes of primary and secondary endpoints.
In cancer drug trials, improvement in overall survival (OS) is the most convincing measure of drug efficacy and
patient benefit. Measuring survival requires prolonged follow-up and large patient numbers, and it may be confounded by

the use of effective rescue therapies. To address this limitation, many studies have introduced a range of intermediate time-to-event endpoints,15,16 such as the time to
disease progression (TTP), progression-free survival
(PFS), the time to treatment failure (TTF), and the time
to response (TTR). In addition, greater emphasis has been
placed on subcategorizing response in terms of complete
response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD),
or progressive disease (PD) rather than using the overall
response rate (RR). The duration of response (DOR),
which is measured from the time of initial response to
documented tumor progression, also is being reported
increasingly. It is proposed that the use of intermediate
endpoints will shorten the duration of drug development,
minimize the exposure of patients to ineffective or toxic
treatments, and accelerate the availability of new medicines.17 Several cancer drugs have been marketed and
publicly subsidized on the basis of their impact on intermediate time-to-event endpoints. New biologic agents,
such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, or panitumumab, are
characterized by a cytostatic mechanism of action rather
than by cytotoxicity, which is used to characterize chemotherapy. For this reason, SD has been proposed as a relevant clinical endpoint by some investigators rather than
objective tumor shrinkage. To date, this endpoint has not
been accepted by regulators.
Nevertheless, this change in the paradigm of cancer
trial design and conduct has prompted drug regulators,
healthcare payers, and the pharmaceutical industry to
explore indirect ways of establishing the veracity of claims
regarding new medicines. In this regard, the body of published literature potentially holds baseline information on
trial populations and on the natural history of cancer with
and without cytotoxic chemotherapy. Analysis of these
data also may allow quantification of the changes in intermediate endpoints for patients who are exposed to chemotherapy and distillation of the changes related to the
therapeutic effect of the drug versus those attributable to
baseline improvements over time in medical care.
Although studies have demonstrated that many trial
reports fail to comply with the CONSORT statement, it
remains important to test the possibility that historic trial
reports contain such useful information.
Colorectal cancer is 1 of the most common cancers
in the world and has a poor outcome in advanced stages.
Over the last 40 years, fluoropyrimidines have been an integral part of the treatment for patients with advanced
colorectal cancer (ACRC). Despite constant modulation
(ie, bolus vs infusional or oral vs intravenous), it was not

Cancer

until the early years of this decade that treatment outcome
options for patients with ACRC improved significantly.18,19 For these reasons, a study of first-line clinical
trials in ACRC provides an ideal opportunity to address
several significant questions related to cancer trial endpoints and the adequacy of the trial reports in this area.
The objectives of this study were to analyze published
RCTs of ACRC during the period from 1966 to 2005 to
determine the frequency of reporting of time-to-event
endpoints and tumor response outcomes. We also examined the relation between year of publication and the
reported effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or equivalent agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE [1966 to
June,2005]; EMBASE [1980-2005]; the Cochrane
Library, Issue 2 [2004]; PubMed [June 14, 2005]; Current Contents [1993 to June 2005]; CINAHL [1982, to
June, 2005]; and OldMedline [1950-1965]) to identify
RCTs in ACRC, as reported previously.20 Trials were
included in the current study if they assessed first-line
pharmacologic treatments, contained 2 arms, and
reported OS and either response or TTP. Exclusion criteria were nonrandomized design, single-arm trials, and trial
duplicates. In the event of updated trial results, information from the most recent published article was included.
There were no language restrictions, and all abstracts were
screened. To reduce the bias resulting from unpublished
data, the abstracts from conferences and medical meetings
or proceedings also were examined. These abstracts
included those published until June 1, 2005 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Cancer
Organization/European Society for Medical Oncology,
and the National Cancer Institute.
Data Extraction
The data-extraction process and the methods that we used
to assess the quality of each study have been previously
reported.20 To validate the accuracy of the data and to
ensure trial updates had been incorporated, 1 author
(I.N.) re-extracted the dataset before analysis. Figure 1
provides a flow diagram describing the number of trials,
arms, and study participants.
The following trial characteristics were extracted:
size, number of treatment arms, recruitment period, and
year of publication. The reported baseline patient

characteristics of median age, sex, previous adjuvant therapy, tumor site (colon or rectum), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status were
obtained for each treatment group in every trial along
with the number of patients (measured as intention to
treat [ITT], evaluable, and eligible). Because of the inconsistency of reporting, performance status was summarized
only as the percentage in each category when available
(ECOG 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).
For each treatment group in each trial, time-to-event
outcomes (OS, DOR, TTP, PFS, TTF, and TTR) were
recorded in months. Outcomes were recorded based on 3
possible patient groups: the ITT population, the evaluable
population, or the eligible population. For tumor
response endpoints (CR, PR, SD, PD, and RR), the number of participants who achieved the specified response
was entered for each arm. The population on which the
response was based (ie, ITT, evaluable, or eligible) also
was recorded, and response rates were calculated based on
the appropriate patient population. Although outcomes
were presented for 3 possible groups, outcomes were
included in analyses based on the ITT population as the
first choice, followed by those obtained from an evaluable
population. Outcomes based on eligible populations were
not analyzed and were deemed ‘‘not recorded.’’
To examine the changes in the frequency of reporting trial endpoints over time, first, we identified the subset
of trial arms that contained only 5-FU or equivalent

834

agents. These agents were classified as 5-FU alone (bolus
and infusional); 5-FU (bolus and infusional) in combination with biomodulating agents like methotrexate, Nphosphonacetyl-l-aspartate acid, allopurinol, dipyridamole, trimetrexate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, levamisole,
or folinic acid; 5-FU plus chemoimmunotherapy (protein
A sepherose, thymostimulin, interferon); oral fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine, tegafur-uracil, eniluracil/FU, doxifluridine); thymidylate inhibitors (raltitrexed); and 5FU–containing regimens in combination with other cytotoxics (cisplatin) for which the outcome was not superior
to the standard 5-FU–based arm. For each study, 2
authors (H.-T.A. and R.W.) identified the trial arms that
belonged to 1 of the 6 5-FU categories described above.
The total patient population for this analysis was estimated from treatment-group sizes using the ITT population as the first choice; otherwise, we used the evaluable
population (Fig. 1). We considered it appropriate to set a
cutoff for this analysis at June 1, 2005, because most trial
arms in the recent 5 years contained combination agents
of oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or without biologic
agents.

Statistical Analysis
Overall trial characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Patient characteristics were summarized for all arms and for 5-FU or equivalent arms,
weighting for the size of each trial arm.
The overall frequency of outcome reporting was
tabulated for all time-to-event and rate-based outcomes
using both trial and arm as units of analysis. Outcome
reporting for selected outcomes also was summarized for
the periods before 1990, from 1990 to 1999, and from
2000 to 2005. Associations between reporting and period
were assessed using the overall chi-square test and the chisquare test for trend with no weighting applied.
Outcomes of OS, TTP, DOR, and RR, SD, and PD
were summarized for 5-FU or equivalent arms. The mean
(95% confidence interval) of the median or the rates of
these outcomes were plotted for the time periods and
overall. Simple linear regression models weighted by trial
arm size were constructed to investigate the relation
between these selected outcomes and year of publication.
Regressions were summarized by the slope, representing
the estimated change in outcome for each year of publication. Residual plots were inspected to assess the assumptions of linear regression. Data were analyzed using SAS
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Of the 289 arms that reported sex, there were 159 arms in which the sum of men and women was equal to the intentto-treat number of patients, 86 arms in which the sum was equal to the evaluable number of patients, 42 arms in which
the sum was equal to the number of eligible patients, and 2 arms in which the sum was not equal to any of the given
numbers of patients. Some publications reported the exact numbers of men and women or reported only percentages,
yet others included only information on 1 sex group.

RESULTS
Trial Characteristics and Reporting of
Baseline Patient Demographics
In total, 144 ACRC RCTs, either phase 2 or phase 3,
were identified that involved 35,853 patients in 340 trial
arms. All trials studied first-line cytotoxic therapy either
alone or in combination. The median number of patients
per trial was 187 (range, 25-1120 patients per trial). Most
trials (n ¼ 111 trials; 77%) included 2 treatment arms,
and 33 trials (23%) reported on 3 arms. Eight studies
(6%) were reported in the form of abstracts, and the
remaining 136 studies (94%) were published as full
articles. Twenty RCTs (14%) were phase 2 studies, and
124 RCTs (86%) were phase 3 studies. Less than 10% of
the RCTs in this study predated 1986, and most were
published during the 1990s and later. The median duration of follow-up was published in only 44 trials (31%);
and, considering these trials separately, the median duration of follow-up was 21 months (range, 4-61 months).

Most trials that are cited in this report were published
within 2 to 3 years of completing patient accrual.
We identified a total of 279 arms that used 5-FU–
based or equivalent agents from 131 trials (data not
shown). Of those 279 arms, 226 arms reported population sizes based on an ITT population, and 51 arms
reported only evaluable sizes, providing an estimated total
sample size of 28,636 patients. Two arms were halted: 1
because of futility21 and another as a result of prespecified
interim analysis.22 The major patient baseline characteristics of the 5-FU or equivalent cohort were similar to those
of the entire study population, and there were no differences in the frequency with which those characteristics were
recorded (Table 1).

studies reported RR (130 trials; 90%), as shown in Table
2. The number of patients with SD or PD was captured in
about 60% of trials. We were able to derive the disease
control rate (DCR) (DCR ¼ RR þ SD) for 83 trials
(58%), incorporating 189 arms and 18,128 patients.
Most trials (123 of 144; 85%) used World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to assess response, 3 trials (2%)
used Southwest Oncology Group criteria, 2 trials (1%)
used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), and the remaining 16 trials (11%) failed to
specify any criteria. In general, time-to-event endpoints
were reported less frequently than response rates (Table
2). It is noteworthy that the reporting of most time-toevent outcomes did not alter significantly over the period
examined in this study (Table 3). For response-based outcomes, there was weak evidence of a decrease in reporting

836

of RR (P ¼ .07) and evidence of an increase in reporting
of SD (P ¼ .04) and PD (P ¼ .0002) over time. Reporting of both OS and DOR decreased in the 1990s compared with the preceding decade, although reporting
improved from 2000. TTP reporting, however, increased
in the 1990s but decreased after 2000.
Changes in Reported Clinical Effectiveness of
5-Florouracil in Trial Participants With Time
A comparison of 3 time periods revealed that there was a
significant increase in the median OS from 9.4 months in
the pre-1990s period to 13.5 months in 2000 (Table 4;
Fig. 2, top). With regard to response endpoints, the rate
of SD increased significantly, and the rate of PD declined,
yet there was no change in the overall RR (Table 4; Fig. 2,
bottom).

DISCUSSION
The current results indicate that the reported OS for trial
arms that received 5-FU or equivalent agents increased
significantly over the study period. Factors that contributed to this increase include arm crossover to a more
active treatment arm (for instance, oxaliplatin and irinotecan), lead time bias, and improvements in symptom control and palliative care. In contrast to the changes in
survival, we observed that neither the response duration
nor the time to progression altered across the study period. This illustrates the observation that the growing
availability of alternative treatments does not have an
impact on these intermediate endpoints. For this reason,
such treatments are likely to represent reliable historic
comparison points for future studies.
Response rates were reported more frequently than
time-to-event endpoints. It is noteworthy that there was a
consistent improvement in the rate of reporting of SD
and PD; and, although the reporting still was less than
that for the RR, >60% of trial arms after 2000 captured
these endpoints. It also is noteworthy that, concomitant
with this increased reporting, we also observed a highly
significant increase in the percentage of patients who
achieved SD and an 11% decrease in the percentage with
PD. These changes may related to the availability of more
stringent follow-up imaging in recent years. For example,
more frequent follow-up schedules could result in an
increased fraction of SD, especially in slow-growing
tumors, in which time intervals are too short to recognize
true PD. Our observations regarding SD have implications for those who advocate the use of this endpoint as a
valid outcome in early trials of new agents.23 Our data
Cancer

suggest that there is a lack of precision in defining this
term, and the classification of tumors into this category
may be open to considerable interpretation.
Although there is ongoing discussion about the importance of reporting according to the CONSORT statement, there are very few reports that that have
comprehensively evaluated compliance with CONSORT,
and we know of none in the setting of metastatic CRC.
Although the purpose of our study was not to rectify this
gap, we were able to make several observations. Baseline
patient characteristics, including age and performance status, were poorly reported. The duration of follow-up was
published in only 31% of the studies, and 11% of trials
failed to mention the criteria they used to assess response.
We also noted that the beginning of the time interval for
measuring time-to-event endpoints was defined variously
as the date of diagnosis, the date of enrolment onto the
trial, or the first visit to the oncologist. Similar problems
arose in defining the end of the time interval. In some
studies, this was defined by measured progression,
whereas, in others, it was defined as patient death (regardless of etiology) or the last known review. In many studies,
this information was not provided. The consequence of a
lack of standardization around measurement is that the
time-to-event interval may appear shorter or longer,
depending on the date selected for completion or initiation of the measurement. Although the constant variation
of time-to-event definitions is not primarily a problem of
trial quality, it may have an impact on the correct interpretation of surrogate markers. Readers must be aware
that different classification for the same endpoint often
are used and commonly are combined in meta-analytic

approaches. Strictly speaking, comparisons between trials
that use the same surrogate endpoint but a different definition should not be made or at least should not be
disclosed.
Our study has several significant limitations. First,
the 3 time periods chosen for analysis were necessarily arbitrary. The period from 2000 onward was selected to

capture the impact of the publication of CONSORT in
1996, and the period after 1990 reflected the period after
the publications of guidelines regarding trial reporting.24,25 The inclusion of very old studies also may have
biased our conclusions; however, <10% of the studies we
included were published before 1986. Second, comparisons between trials inevitably were compromised by the

use of different response criteria and undisclosed variations in medical imaging techniques. Even with the use of
guidelines, such as WHO and RECIST, consistency could
not be guaranteed, especially given the measurement variations mentioned above. Third, by pooling the 5-FU trial
arms, we have made the assumption that the route of
administration or the method of administration does not
alter the response rates.
In our analysis, we considered only published trials.
Moreover, the inclusion of unpublished trials, for example, those with negative outcomes or poor quality designs,
may have altered our conclusions. Finally, a small number
of studies that were included in our analysis were phase 2
trials (14%) rather than phase 3 trials. Although phase 2
studies traditionally have different endpoints than phase 3
trials, all studies that were included in our analysis met
predetermined criteria for inclusion, and phase was not 1
of the criteria.
In summary, we have highlighted several issues
related to the quality and reporting of RCTs in ACRC
that need to be considered when using these data in metaanalyses for constructing new statistical hypotheses or for
benchmarking the potential impact of new therapies that
have been evaluated only in single-arm trials. Compliance
with the CONSORT statement would greatly improve
reporting; however, our results lend strong support to the
proposal of others26,27 that greater attention is needed to
the definitional issues around how and when time-toevent and response endpoints should be collected and
reported.
