ABSTRACT
Chrysotile, like other types of asbestos, has been associated with mesothelioma,
lung cancer and asbestosis. However, the cellular abnormalities induced by these
fibers involved in cancer development have not been elucidated yet. Previous works
show that chrysotile fibers induce features of cancer cells, such as aneuploidy,
multinucleation and multipolar mitosis. In the present study, normal and cancer
derived human cell lines were treated with chrysotile and the cellular and molecular
mechanisms related to generation of aneuploid cells was elucidated. The first
alteration observed was cytokinesis regression, the main cause of multinucleated
cells formation and centrosome amplification. The multinucleated cells formed
after cytokinesis regression were able to progress through cell cycle and generated
aneuploid cells after abnormal mitosis. To understand the process of cytokinesis
regression, localization of cytokinetic proteins was investigated. It was observed
mislocalization of Anillin, Aurora B, Septin 9 and Alix in the intercellular bridge, and
no determination of secondary constriction and abscission sites. Fiber treatment
also led to overexpression of genes related to cancer, cytokinesis and cell cycle.
The results show that chrysotile fibers induce cellular and molecular alterations in
normal and tumor cells that have been related to cancer initiation and progression,
and that tetraploidization and aneuploid cell formation are striking events after fiber
internalization, which could generate a favorable context to cancer development.

INTRODUCTION

for the aneuploid phenotype [5, 6].
Aneuploidy is also a feature of tumors induced
by asbestos in vivo [7], and is observed after asbestos
treatments in vitro [8-10]. These mineral fibers are
considered environmental carcinogens and have been
implicated in lung cancers and other serious lung diseases
(silicosis, carcinomas and mesotheliomas) [11-13], being
banished from many countries. There are two groups
of asbestos fibers: amphiboles (which include amosite
and crocidolite fibers, strongly correlated to lung cancer
and mesotheliomas) and serpentines. Serpentines are
represented by chrysotile fibers, the only type of asbestos
fiber that is still used commercially in many developing
countries. Chrysotile is considered more flexible, with
a small transverse section and fail to accumulate in the

Aneuploidy is characterized by gains and losses
of entire chromosomes or parts of chromosomes leading
to genomic instability. This phenotype has become a
hallmark of solid tumors. The role of aneuploidy in
tumorigenesis has been proposed for more than 100 years
ago, and it is still under investigation. Aneuploidy can
induce or suppress cell proliferation, and thus, promote or
inhibit tumor growth [1-4]. Aneuploid cells arise mainly
from errors during mitosis such as loss of chromosome
cohesion, aberrant microtubule-kinetochore contacts,
centrosome amplification and cytokinesis failure. This last
dramatic event of cell division failure generates tetraploid
cells, which are, in turn, thought to be largely responsible

lungs after fiber fragmentation into short pieces. Despite
the differences between amphibole and serpentine fibers,
both are considered carcinogenic to humans.
Chrysotile fibers when taken up by cells can affect
cell morphology and led to mitotic dysfunction. However,
little is known about the molecular mechanisms of
chrysotile carcinogenesis. Once internalized [9, 14-16],
chrysotile fibers can bind proteins, RNAs and organelles
and can influence cell behavior [9, 17-20]. For example,
they can generate oxygen reactive species that induce cell
stress, oxidation reactions, DNA strand breaks and cell
death [21-24].
Chrysotile fibers interfere with mitosis leading
to mitotic failure, tetraploidization, multinucleation,
centrosome amplification and multipolar spindles that
generate multiple progeny [8, 9, 25, 26]. However, the
mechanisms responsible for aberrant mitotic events have
yet to be elucidated [25].
Our earlier work described some of the effects of
chrysotile on cancer cells [8], revealing the presence of
aneuploidy and multipolar mitosis. In the present study,
we focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these
effects, investigating the causes of mitotic and cytokinetic
abnormalities and then understanding how aneuploid cells
are generated after chrysotile exposure. Also, besides
human lung cancer cells we have used a normal epithelial
cell culture model to mimic the cells that chrysotile would
first encounter when introduced into the lung. This enables
us to identify phenotypes, cellular and molecular changes
that accompany the tumorigenic process in cells similar to
those that become cancerous in vivo.

Chrysotile treatment induces tetraploidy in
normal and cancer cells

RESULTS

Centrosome amplification after chrysotile
treatment: a consequence of cytokinesis defects

Chrysotile treatment induces multinucleation and
multipolar divisions in normal and cancer cells

After chrysotile treatment, 84.5% of RPE-1 cells
with centrosome amplification were multinucleated
(Figure 2A). Labeling daughter and mother centrioles
evidenced that after chrysotile treatment cells with
centrosome amplification generally presented two mother
and two daughter centrioles (Figure S1). Similar results
were obtained in LC-HK2 cells (data not shown).
To test if centrosome amplification occurred
simultaneously with the increase of chromosome number,
the number of chromosomes in bipolar and multipolar
mitosis was evaluated. Bipolar mitotic control RPE-1 cells
showed 40 to 47 centromeres, while multipolar mitotic
chrysotile-treated cells showed 73 to 122 centromeres
(average of 96) (Figure 2B, 2C and 2E). Similar results
were observed in LC-HK2 cells: in control bipolar mitosis
it was observed 102 to 182 kinetochores, with an average
of 142, and in multipolar mitotic cells after chrysotile
treatment 155 to 372 kinetochores were detected, with
average of 265 (Figure 2E).
These results showed that centrosome amplification
after chrysotile treatment occurred simultaneously to the

The number of chromosomes in RPE-1 and LCHK2 cells was evaluated in metaphase spreads.
92% of mitotic RPE-1 cells had between 42 and
50 chromosomes, considered the diploid interval. The
remaining 8% was distributed between less than 42
chromosomes (hypodiploid, 4%), 84 to 101 chromosomes
(tetraploid, 2%) and more than 101 chromosomes
(hypertetraploid, 2%). After 48 h of chrysotile treatment,
the percentages of tetraploid cells increased to 10% and
the hyperdiploid to 4%. After treatment followed by 48
h of recovery, the tetraploid and hyperdiploid population
decreased, returning to control levels (Figure 1D). After
96 h of recovery, fewer mitosis were observed and no
significant differences were observed between control and
treated cells (data not shown).
In LC-HK2 cells, tetraploid population was also
detected after 48 h of chrysotile treatment and after
treatment followed by 48 h of recovery. After 96 h of
recovery, the tetraploid population decreased, but at this
time point the diploid population was 37%, indicating
that fiber treatment led to a dramatically change in
chromosome number of proliferating LC-HK2 cells
(Figure 1E).
Together, these data showed that chrysotile
treatment induced tetraploidy in normal and cancer cells,
and that tetraploidy might be a route to aneuploidy mainly
in cancer cells.

The main effects of chrysotile treatment on LCHK2 cancer cells were multinucleation, centrosome
amplification and multipolar mitosis, as described by
our group [8]. Here we test potential effects of chrysotile
on epithelial cells from normal tissue (RPE-1 cells),
to compare the behavior of normal and cancer cells
after fiber treatment. After 24 h of chrysotile treatment
multinucleation (bi+multinucleation) was 8.2-fold higher
than control cells and reached 15-fold at 48 h (Figure 1A).
At this time point cells with more than two centrosomes
increased 7.4-fold over control (Figure 1B), and multipolar
mitosis - not observed in control cells- represented 17% of
mitotic cells (Figure 1C).

that continued into cytokinesis until cells remained
interconnected by an intercellular bridge with a phasedense midbody at the center (Figure S2).
After 12 h of chrysotile treatment, fibers were often
observed in the intercellular bridge (Figures 3A, 3B,
S3, and S4). Around 20% of RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells
in mitosis regressed to form a single cell with more than
one nucleus after 4 to 16 h in cytokinesis (Figure 3A, 3B,
and Figure S3). In some cases the intercellular bridge
seemed to be resolved, but the daughter cells approached
or emitted new protrusions and then fused (Figure S3).
Some cells with fibers in the intercellular bridge could
finish cytokinesis, delivering the fiber to one of the cells
after severing of the bridge in one point (Figure S4A).
Other possibility was the fiber release in the extracellular
medium after bridge severing (Figure S4B).
After 24 h of chrysotile treatment, multinucleated
cells were observed in LC-HK2 and RPE-1 cultures.
RPE-1 multinucleated cells could not start mitosis at
similar rates than mononucleated cells, while LC-HK2
multinucleated cells entered mitosis as mononucleated
cells did. The multinucleated cells that entered mitosis
showed similar fates in both cell lines. These cells
progressed through cell cycle and in some cases formed
bipolar spindles after organizing their chromosomes in
the metaphase plate (Figure 3D). However, in most cases
when a multinucleated cell progressed through cell cycle
they generated multipolar mitoses. These cells could be
divided into 2 to 4 daughter cells, often followed by cell
fusion, generating bi or multinucleated cells (Figure 3C,
3E and 3F). Other possibility was the cell division in three
cells followed by cell fusion generating two daughter
cells, which could finish cytokinesis properly (Figure 3F)
or undergo cytokinesis regression.
According to these data, multipolar mitoses
after chrysotile treatment were often generated by
multinucleated cells that could progress through cell cycle.
These multipolar mitoses often resulted in cell fusions that
generated other multinucleated cells.

treatment, Aurora B was not restricted to midbody flanking
regions. In 20-40% of cytokineses it appeared as rings and
puncta in the regions between the midbody and the plasma
membrane, with a dramatic concentration at the midbody
ring/stem body (Figure 4B and 4G).
Anillin (actin binding protein) localizes at the
midzone near the plasma membrane during telophase,
and then forms plasma membrane tubular protrusions at
the intercellular bridge during its establishment. At late
stages of cytokinesis Anillin is located at the stem body
[27, 30], and then is directed to the secondary constriction
sites [31]. The roles of Anillin are not fully understood;
however, it seems to be crucial for furrow ingression
establishment [30] and abscission sites determination
[31, 32]. In control RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells Anillin was
observed in the intercellular bridge forming one ring in
the stem body or could be located in the stem body and
secondary constriction sites. In 14.5% and 28.7% of the
cytokinesis of RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells, respectively,
location of Anillin was not restricted to constriction sites
or stem body, and others structures in the intercellular
bridge were detected (Figure 4C and 4H). After 24 h
of chrysotile treatment Anillin was observed in larger
structures similar to rings near the stem body or near the
plasma membrane (Figure 4D). These structures occurred
in almost 50% of RPE-1 cytokineses after 24 h and 48 h
of chrysotile treatment, and in LC-HK2 cells they were
observed 37% of cytokinesis after 24 h of treatment
and reached 52% 48 h of treatment followed by 24 h of
recovery (Figure 4H).
Other proteins were investigated only in RPE-1
cells. Septin 9 is member of the Septin protein family
that is involved in abscission. It is located similarly to
Anillin during cytokinesis, and is also involved in tubular
structures in initial steps of cytokinesis and secondary
constriction site determination [31, 32]. It was detected
in control cells at the midbody, near the stem body or
secondary constriction sites (Figure S5A). After chrysotile
treatment for 24 h, Septin 9 was present in the midbody
in huge structures from the stem body to the plasma
membrane (Figure S5B and C). Alix, a protein required for
abscission [33], appears at midbody during intermediate
and late stages of cytokinesis and it is directed to the
abscission site when it is determined. In RPE-1 cells Alix
was observed in two parallel structures in the midbody
(Figure 4E). After 24 h or 48 h of chrysotile treatment
Alix was observed in just one structure in center of the
midbody (Figure 4F).
In contrast to the mislocalization of Aurora B,
Anillin, Septin 9 and Alix, other proteins were normally
localized in the intercellular bridge after chrysotile
treatment. Cenp E (centromere protein E) is located at the
midzone during telophase and then is directed to flanking
zones at the midbody. RacGAP1 (a GTPase activating
protein involved in RhoA regulation) is directed to the
stem body during cytokinesis. MKLP1 is a marker of

Disruption of cytokinetic proteins after chrysotile
treatment
To investigate alterations during cytokinesis
following chrysotile treatment, cells were treated with
fibers for 24 h or 48 h, fixed and imaged to determine
the location of proteins involved at different cytokinetic
stages.
Aurora B is a kinase located at midzone during
telophase and at the flanking regions of the midbody
during cytokinesis [27]. When Aurora B is inactivated
cytokinesis can progress and abscission occurs. On the
other hand, activation of Aurora B inhibits late stages of
cytokinesis [28, 29]. In control RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells
Aurora B was located properly (~90% of cytokinesis,

cytokinesis and in post-mitotic midbodies. These three
proteins - Cenp E, RacGAP1 and MKLP1 - were properly

located in the intercellular bridge in chrysotile-treated cells
(data not shown). This indicated that chrysotile treatment
did not alter all stages of cytokinesis and location of

all cytokinetic proteins, but mainly the ones related to
intermediate and final steps of cytokinesis.
The presence of secondary constriction sites - a
late step of constriction of the intercellular bridge during
cytokinesis - was seen after IF staining for acetylated
tubulin. In control RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells 58% and 72%
of intercellular bridges showed secondary constriction
sites, respectively. After 24 h of chrysotile treatment,
the presence of secondary constriction sites decreased
to 43% of the cytokinesis in RPE-1 cell and 45% in LCHK2 cells. During longer treatment periods and after
treatments followed by recovery periods the percentages
of intercellular bridges with secondary constriction sites
remained reduced relative to controls (Figure 4I).

genes, which encode Aurora B and Septin 2 proteins.
Increased expression of ANLN (Anillin gene) was
detected in LC-HK2 cells and decreased expression of
this gene was observed in RPE-1 cells. In LC-HK2 cells,
CENPE and AURKA showed increased expression, while

of SEPT7 (Septin 7 gene) and KIF23 (which encodes
MKLP1 protein) were observed after chrysotile treatment
in either cell line. Among genes related to abscission,
RPE-1 cells showed increased expression of TSG101 (a
member of ESCRT-I complex, required for membrane
fusion and fission) [33], while LC-HK2 cells showed
increased expression of PDCD6IP - the gene that encodes

CHMP3 (ESCRT complex proteins, related to membrane
budding and fission) [33] were detected in both cells lines

the expression of some genes related to cytokinesis and

lead to striking differences in expression. However, the
differences in genes related to cytokinesis indicated that
a cellular response to chrysotile internalization might
include changes in gene expression, and that these
differences may interfere with cell behavior.

HK2 cells: in RPE-1 cells treated with chrysotile for 48 h,
we saw a 1.9-fold increase of cells in S phase with more
than 4C DNA content over control, while in LC-HK2 cells
this increase was about 4.6-fold over control cells (Figure
6C and 6D). This data showed that RPE-1 and LC-HK2
cells, diploid or not, were able to enter S phase, but RPE-1
showed limited capability to enter M phase after chrysotile
treatment.

Chrysotile treatment alters proliferation of
normal cells

DISCUSSION

Despite morphological alterations caused by
chrysotile in LC-HK2 cells, they do not show a reduction
of mitotic index or number of cells in culture [25]. In RPE1 cells the mitotic index decreased from 3.2 to 1.2% after
48 h of treatment (Figure 6A), and the number of cells in
culture decreased 0.7-fold after 48 h of treatment followed
by 48 h of recovery (Figure 6B).
The proliferation of LC-HK2 and RPE-1 cells was
analyzed by BrdU incorporation. The percentages of RPE1 and LC-HK2 cells in S phase did not show significant
differences after chrysotile treatment. However, when the
percentages of cells in S phase were analyzed by their
DNA content, the percentages of cells in S phase with
DNA content higher than 4C increased mainly in LC-

Chrysotile fibers were reported to lead to
aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo, but how aneuploid cells
arise was not clear. There was some evidence regarding
cytokinesis defects, centrosome amplification and
multipolar mitosis, but no connection between these
abnormalities and generation of aneuploid cells was
made. In the present study we investigated the causes
of centrosome amplification and our data demonstrate
that cytokinesis failure might be the major responsible
for this amplification. Corroborating this idea, the first
alteration after fiber treatment observed by time-lapse was
cytokinesis regression. Investigating the causes of this
regression, we observed that specific proteins required

RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells were treated with chrysotile for 48 h, and several alterations in cell morphology, ploidy, mitosis
and centrosomes were observed. Some differences between the two cell lines behavior after treatment were also observed.
for cytokinesis were mislocated in the intercellular
bridge after fiber exposure, and that some genes related
to cytokinesis were differentially expressed. Also, we
observed that tetraploid cells generated in normal and
cancer cell lines could progress through cell cycle and
originate multipolar mitoses, which can form aneuploid
cells. Aneuploid cancer cells, but not aneuploid normal
cells, were observed in mitosis, indicating that in normalderived cells tetraploidy does not limit proliferation, while
aneuploidy does. This data is summarized in Table 1.
In our experiments, chrysotile fibers were
internalized by RPE-1 and LC-HK2 cells in less than
24 h. The first alteration in mitosis was observed during
cytokinesis, as reported previously [8, 26]. New fates of
fibers located in the intercellular bridge were observed:
one of the daughters could incorporate them following
abscission or the fibers could be released into the culture
medium with part of the intercellular bridge. However, in
most cases of cytokinesis with a fiber in the intercellular
bridge the fate was regression followed by generation of a
multinucleated daughter cell.
Some studies show the potential of asbestos fibers to
bind and retain proteins when incubated with cell lysates
or serum [9, 17], and this process can also increase fiber
uptake by cells [34]. However, the images in the present
study did not show proteins required for cytokinesis colocalized or retained by fibers. This indicates that either
fibers did not adsorb these proteins or that fibers were
surrounded by membrane inside the cells, and did not
interact with the cytoplasm and its proteins. Chrysotile
fibers are also capable to adsorb phospholipids and
membranes [35, 36], which could help to maintain fibers
surrounded by membranes and not in contact with the
proteins in the cytoplasm.
The presence of fibers did not affect the mechanisms
responsible for recruitment of proteins to intercellular
bridge. However, the localization of some proteins Anillin, Septin 9, Aurora B and Alix - was altered in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chrysotile treated cells. These proteins are involved mainly
in intermediate to final steps of cytokinesis. Anillin is
important for Septin recruitment into filaments near to the
plasma membrane. After intracellular bridge maturation
these protein migrate to the stem body or to secondary
constriction sites, where they are crucial for determination
of the abscission site, where the ESCRT III complex
will act [31]. Aurora B also coordinates cytokinesis its activation delays cytokinesis and abscission -, and
it has been related to abscission by phospholyration of
ESCRT elements [37]. In chrysotile-treated cells with
mislocalization of Septin,Anillin and Aurora B, bridges
showed thickness and length similar to mature bridges, but
Anillin and Septin did not migrate to constriction sites.
The number of bridges with secondary constriction sites
decreased, and Alix, a protein related to abscission, did
not migrate to abscission sites, supporting the idea that
Anillin and Septin mislocalization results in abscission
failure. The presence of chrysotile fibers may not allow
bridge maturation, maintaining a molecular signal which
results in no secondary constriction sites. This signal could
be related to Anillin and Septin since they are required for
abscission site determination, and also to Aurora B, which
is involved in the No Cut pathway [28, 38]. Together,
these results suggested a cellular response, which involves
Aurora B, Anillin and Septin in delaying abscission, what
should be further investigated.
The expression of some genes related to cytokinesis
was altered after chrysotile treatment in RPE-1 and LCHK2 cells. Although chrysotile was reported to interact
with RNA and proteins related to transcription and
translation, being able to alter these processes [19], the
differences found in gene expression in the present study
might be a consequence of cytokinesis defects. The
presence of chrysotile fibers in the intercellular bridge
and the lack of constriction sites specification may induce
cellular responses that include changes in gene expression.
The increased expression of AURKB and SEPT2 in RPE-1

and LC-HK2 cells after chrysotile treatment may be part
of a mechanism that prevents cytokinesis progression.
Interestingly, overexpression of Septins and Aurora
B were described in many solid tumors, such as lung,
brain and breast [39, 40]. Aurora B is involved in different
mitotic processes, and is now a target of new cancer
therapies [40, 41]. Overexpression of Septin 9 was widely
detected in tumors [39] and SEPT9 is now considered a
biomarker for early detection of colorectal cancer [42,
43]. Septin 2 is involved in cytokinesis and chromosome
alignment, and can also be involved with aneuploidy
promotion [44]. In this context, the mislocation of Septin
9 and Aurora B and the overexpression of SEPT2 and
AURKB gene in chrysotile-treated cells may represent
another tumoral cell feature acquired by the presence of
fibers. Moreover, our data show that Septins and Aurora
B mislocation and/or overexpression might be related to
cytokinesis failure and generation of aneuploidy, revealing
a possible role of these proteins in cancer development.
Importantly, all the alterations observed during
cytokinesis culminated not only in cytokinesis failure,
but also in regression and tetraploid cell formation with
centrosome amplification. Tetraploid cells from both
studied cell lines progressed through cell cycle and
reached mitosis, generating multipolar mitoses. Different
abnormalities during these mitoses were observed, leading
to aneuploidy. It was during mitosis that a difference
between normal and cancer-derived cells was observed:
aneuploid cells in mitosis were only observed in cancer
cells.
Control cancer cells already showed aneuploid
DNA content, so differences in these aneuploid
karyotypes might not be so deleterious when compared
to normal cells. However, these differences also showed
that cancer cells can be adapted to several differences
in their karyotype. In normal RPE-1 cells, aneuploidy
interfered with proliferation, and aneuploid cells were
not observed in metaphase spreads. Normal cells might
have mechanisms to detect karyotypes different from
diploid and tetraploid and prevent these cells proliferation.
Alternatively, aneuploid karyotypes could generate
an imbalance of RNA and proteins that decreases cell
viability and proliferation. In this second case, RPE-1
aneuploid cells after chrysotile treatment may proliferate
at low rates, reducing the chance to be detected in our in
vitro experiments.
Together, these data showed that chrysotile fibers
can induce cancer-associated characteristics in normal
epithelial cells, and can increase the frequency of these
properties in cancer cells. We found that aneuploidy
generated after chrysotile treatment was a result of
cytokinesis regression and tetraploidization, probably
due to a mechanism that involved mislocalization of
Aurora B, Anillin and Septins, and lack of constriction
and abscission site specification. The tetraploid as a
state between diploid and aneuploid karyotypes has been
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

described, and represent a route to cancer development [5,
6, 45, 46]. In this context, our findings show that cancer
development after chrysotile exposure may be promoted
after cytokinesis failure. Chrysotile fibers have been also
related to production of reactive oxygen species [47]
and DNA strand breaks [21, 23, 48]. These alterations,
together to the generation of aneuploid cells, create a
very favorable context to cancer development and show a
possible way of how a mineral fiber can interfere with cell
behavior and promote cancer-associated abnormalities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The LC-HK2 cells (initially called HK2, a cell line
established from human non-small cell lung carcinoma)
[49] and hTERT RPE-1 (RPE-1) cells (derived from
normal human retina epithelium - ATCC CRL4000) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Minimum Essential Medium (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Chrysotile treatment
Chrysotile 5R (Quebec Standard) obtained from
SAMA Mineração de Amianto Ltda (Minaçu, GO, Brazil)
were provided by Dr. Flavia M. Cassiola. The fibers were
prepared as describe elsewhere [50], and were added to
culture medium. Treatments were performed 35 mm
diameter dishes (2.105 cells/dish). After 24 h in culture,
cells were treated with 2 mL of fresh medium with 125
µg/ml of chrysotile fibers. After 24 h or 48 h the medium
was changed and additional periods of 48 h, 3 or 4 days
in fiber-free medium were conducted (called recovery
periods).

Metaphase spreads
LC-HK2 and RPE-1 cells were treated with 0.01%
Vincristine for 1 h, enzymatically removed from the flasks
and treated with hypotonic solution (4 mL of 0.072M
KCl and 6 m L of 1% sodium citrate) for 20 min. Cells
were fixed in methanol:acetic acid (3:1) and placed into
histological slides. After 3 days cells were stained with
Wright (Merck, Germany) diluted in phosphate buffer
(3:1). Cells were observed under AxioVert microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany) with 100X objective. 100
metaphases of LC-HK2 cells and 50 metaphases of RPE-1
cells were analyzed in three different slides from different
experiments.

as follows: 45°C for 10 minutes, 95°C for 15 minutes and
35 cycles [95°C for 15 seconds; Tm°C for 20 seconds;
72°C for 30 seconds], followed by the melt. Primers
details are in TableS2. The normalization was calculated
using the total RNA [51, 52].

Cell cycle analysis was by flow cytometry, using
Guava System (GE Healthcare, UK). Cells were detached
with trypsin, fixed with methanol: PBS (3:1) for 1 h at
40C and incubated with a solution of 200 µl of PBS, 20
µl of 10mg/mL RNAase and 20 µl of PI for 1 h. 5,000
cells were analyzed for each control and treated sample.
BrdU incorporation was performed with BrdU FITC Flow
Kit (BD Biosciences, USA), according to manufacturer’s
protocol.

Statistical analyses
The results were analyzed by Student’s t-test and P
< 0.05 was considered significant. In figure legends: *P <
0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Control and treated cells were fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde for 30 min or cold methanol for 15 min,
and treated with PBSAT (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100,
1% BSA) for 30 min. Then the cells were stained for
immunofluorescence with primary antibodies for 1 h
followed by 45 min with secondary antibodies (details in
Table S1). The cells nuclei were stained by DAPI. Cell
morphology and presence of chrysotile fibers were imaged
by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 710, Carl
Zeiss). These preparations were also used to quantify
multinucleated, mitotic index and multipolar mitosis:
preparations were observed using fluorescence microscopy
and 1,000 cells/slide and 100 mitosis in three different
slides were counted for each treatment and control. For
kinetochore quantification, confocal images were 3-D
reconstructed by Imaris software (Bitplane).
