BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are widely used for the treatment of
patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have EGFR mutations. Recent studies have indicated that some
patients with positive mutations were refractory to EGFR TKIs if they harbored a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia=lymphoma
(Bcl-2)-like 11 (Bim) deletion polymorphism. The objective of the current work was to retrospectively study the Bim deletion polymorphism in Chinese patients with NSCLC and its correlation with the efficacy of EGFR TKIs. METHODS: Distribution of the Bim polymorphism was detected using polymerase chain reaction analysis and direct sequencing of DNA from peripheral neutrophils in samples
from 352 patients with NSCLC. Of the 352 patients, 166 who received TKI therapy and had an activating mutation identified were
involved in further analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint of the subsequent analyses, and the incidence
of the Bim polymorphism and its relation to clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs also were investigated. RESULTS: In total, 45 of 352
patient samples (12.8%) had the Bim deletion polymorphism, which was distributed randomly with regard to various clinical characteristics. In patients with EGFR mutations who received treatment with TKIs, the median PFS and the median objective response rate
were 4.7 months and 25%, respectively, for those with the Bim deletion polymorphism versus 11 months (P 5.003) and 66% (P 5.001),
respectively, for those with wild-type Bim. Cox regression analysis identified Bim status (P 5.016) and sex (P 5.002) as independent
factors predicting clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of the Bim
deletion polymorphism was approximately 13% in this study, and it was associated with a poor clinical response to EGFR TKIs in

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of major cancer incidence and mortality worldwide.1,2 With the introduction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), approaches to non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
treatment have changed dramatically in the last decade.3,4 Compared with traditional platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, EGFR TKIs like erlotinib and gefitinib have produced amazing effects in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC by
prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) significantly while also improving quality of life.5,6 However, the efficacy of
TKIs is not consistent for every patient. Approximately 10% of patients have primary resistance to TKIs, even those who
have EGFR mutations; and others who respond at first eventually will develop acquired (secondary) resistance (in approximately 1 year).7-9 However, the mechanism of primary resistance remains unclear, because it is a complicated, multifactor
process involving a nonsensitive mutation, gene polymorphism, a cancer stem cell subpopulation, and related protein (eg,
amphiregulin) expression.10-13 Thus, investigations are needed to further understand and overcome these possible
mechanisms.
Bim, also known B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia=lymphoma (Bcl-2)-like 11 (BCL2L11), is a member of the
Bcl-2 family gene that encodes the protein Bim. By binding to all members of the prosurvival Bcl-2 subfamily with high

affinity, Bim serves as a key element in promoting apoptosis.14,15 A previous study demonstrated that, in EGFRTKI–sensitive cell lines, Bim triggered apoptosis through
the intrinsic caspase pathway under EGFR-TKI treatment.16 In addition, another study indicated that a Bim
germline deletion polymorphism was correlated intensively with primary resistance to TKI therapy.17 That
deletion polymorphism led to impaired expression of BH3containing Bim isoforms, which compromised the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR TKIs in patients with NSCLC who had
EGFR mutations. It is noteworthy that this mutation was
observed only in individuals of East Asian ethnicity, indicating its racially heterogeneous nature.
Although the importance of the Bim deletion
polymorphism in patients with NSCLC who receive
EGFR-TKI treatment has garnered much attention, the
distribution and clinicopathologic characteristics of this
polymorphism in Chinese patients with NSCLC and its
prognostic value for EGFR-TKI outcomes remain to be
determined. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Bim
polymorphism in Chinese patients with NSCLC and
especially to determine the efficacy of TKI therapy in the
subgroup of patients who have EGFR mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) was used to detect
EGFR mutations using the Human EGFR Gene Mutations Fluorescence Polymerase Chain Reaction Diagnostic Kit (AmoyDx, Xiamen, China).
Bim Genotyping and Direct Sequencing

All samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to detect Bim polymorphisms using the following
primer sequences: wild-type (WT) Bim forward primer,
50 -ACTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCCTCATGATGA
AGGCTAACTCAA-30 ; and reverse primer, 50 -ACCAG
GAAACAGCTATGACCAACCTCTGACAAGTGAC
CACCA-30 . For the Bim deletion polymorphism, the
forward primer sequence was the same as that used
for WT Bim, and the reverse sequence was 50 -ACCAG
GAAACAGCTATGACCGGCACAGCCTCTATGGA
GAACA-30 (for details, see Fig. 1) The reaction condition was 95 C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles at
94 C for 30 seconds, 60 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for
30 seconds; and a final extension at 72 C for 10 minutes
using the ExTaq Polymerase premix PCR Kit (TaKaRa
Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). PCR products (173 base pairs
[bp] for the Bim deletion polymorphism and 216 bp for
WT Bim) were then separated on a 3% agarose gel with
nucleic acid dye by electrophoresis and were purified
before direct sequencing.

Patients and Samples

This was a retrospective study inspired by the work of Ng
and colleauges.17 In total, 352 consecutive patients with
NSCLC who were hospitalized at Shanghai Pulmonary
Hospital from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013 were
identified in our database. All patients met the following
inclusion criteria: they signed an informed consent form;
they had histologically confirmed NSCLC; they were
aged >18 years; and they had adequate formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue available to detect
EGFR mutations, including sufficient neutrophils to
determine their Bim polymorphism status. Before starting
any treatment, a complete medical history interview,
physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiology
examinations were carried out for each patient. In total,
239 patients, regardless of line of treatment, received 250
mg gefitinib or 150 mg erlotinib daily until they developed either disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
DNA Exaction and EGFR Mutation Detection

DNA from tumor tissue was extracted using the DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit or the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue
Kit (both from Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The Amplification

Data Collection and the Evaluation of TKI
Clinical Efficacy

Clinical data were recorded in detail systemically when
patients were hospitalized for the first time. Smoking status was defined as follows: never smokers were those who
had consumed <100 cigarettes in their whole life, and
smokers were those who had smoked >100 cigarettes in
their whole life (including former and current smokers).
Pathologic diagnoses were reviewed by 3 experienced
pathologists independently, and disease stages were classified according to the seventh edition the International
Association for the Study of Lung Cancer TNM classification system. Tumor response was reviewed every 6 weeks
based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
version 1.1. PFS was the primary endpoint of this study,
because we mainly wanted to evaluate the role played by
the Bim polymorphism in EGFR-TKI therapy. PFS was
calculated from the date TKI treatment was initiated to
the date of either disease progression or death from any
cause. Primary resistance was defined according to a previous report by Jackman et al as disease progression in <6
months without any evidence of response when receiving
TKIs.18 Because of the possibility that the predictive

power of the Bim polymorphism might be diluted by the
poor response to TKIs among patients who had WT
EGFR, only patients who had activating EGFR mutations
were entered into the subsequent analyses of PFS and Bim
polymorphisms.
Statistical Analysis

PFS was plotted and calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences between groups were compared
using the log-rank test. Differences in distribution of the
Bim deletion polymorphism according to patients’ baseline characteristics were compared using the Pearson chisquare test or the Fisher exact test. Cox regression was
used to analyze independent factors. Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium was tested using the Pearson chi-square test.

August 1, 2014

In total, 352 patients with histologically confirmed
NSCLC who were hospitalized at Shanghai Pulmonary
Hospital from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013 were
selected for Bim polymorphism evaluation. All patients
were of Chinese Han ethnicity. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years (age range, 32-81 years), 255 patients
were never smokers, and 97 were smokers. There were
273 patients with adenocarcinoma, 39 with squamous
NSCLC, 27 with adenosquamous NSCLC, and13 with
NSCLC-not otherwise specified. There were 124 WT
EGFR mutations, 122 EGFR exon 19 deletions, 102
EGFR exon 21 substitution of lysine with arginine at
amino acid position 858 (L858R) mutations, and 4 other
rare mutations (including mutations of EGFR exons 18
and 20). Only 1 patient in the group with EGFR mutations had a coexistent substitution of threonine with methionine at EGFR amino acid position 790 (T790M)
mutation. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
One hundred sixty-six of 352 patients who received
EGFR TKIs (regardless of the line of treatment) and had
an activating mutation participated in additional analyses
of Bim polymorphisms and TKI efficiency.
Bim Deletion Polymorphism Distribution

The Bim polymorphism (2903-bp deletion) was detected
by PCR and direct sequencing. Forty-five of 352 patients
(12.8%) harbored this deletion polymorphism, and the
incidence was consistent with a previous report.17 Electrophoretic and sequencing results are provided in Figure 1.
The median age of all Bim deletion polymorphism carriers
was 59 years (range, 39-75 years). Twenty-five carriers
were women, and 30 carriers were never smokers. Adenocarcinoma accounted for most of the Bim deletion polymorphism carriers. Seventeen of 45 carriers (37.8%) had
WT EGFR, and the remaining carriers were positive for a
mutation. Eight patients had stage IIIB disease, and 37
had stage IV disease. The clinicopathologic features of all

germ-line polymorphism, its pattern of distribution did
not differ significantly between the various EGFR mutation types, histologic types, sexes, smoking histories, age
groups, or disease stages.

Outcomes of EGFR-TKI Treatment in Patients
With Activating Mutations

Among 166 patients, 140 (84.3%) received erlotinib, and
26 (15.7%) received gefitinib. At the cutoff date of March
31, 2013, 135 patients (81.3%) had developed disease
progression, and 31 were still receiving TKI therapy without progression. The overall response rate (ORR) was
62%, and the median PFS was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.25-11.15 months). The clinicopathologic features and outcomes of the EGFR-mutated
patients who received TKI therapy are detailed in Table 2,
2302

and data on the Bim polymorphism carriers who had
mutations are provided in Table 3.
Association Between Bim Polymorphism and
TKI Efficiency

Because of the low response rate and short PFS among
patients with WT EGFR (data not shown), it was possible
that the predictive power of the Bim polymorphism could
be diluted. Therefore, additional analyses were conducted
only in the subgroup with EGFR mutations. In this group,
the median PFS was 11 months (95% CI, 8.48-13.52
months) for patients with WT Bim and 4.7 months (95%
CI, 2.94-6.46 months) for those who had the Bim deletion polymorphism (P 5 .003). The ORR for patients
who had the Bim deletion polymorphism versus those
who had WT Bim was 25% versus 66%, respectively
(P 5 .001), and the disease control rate was 62.5% versus
81.3%, respectively (P 5 .076).

An analysis of the impact of the EGFR exon 19 deletion and the EGFR L858R mutation on Bim deletion
polymorphism carriers also was performed. However, the
results did not indicate statistical significance. For patients
who harbored an EGFR exon 19 deletion, PFS was 11.3
months (95% CI, 7.74-14.86 months); and, for those
who had the L858R mutation, the PFS was 8 months
(95% CI, 5.66-10.34 months; P 5 .372). However, in
their counterparts who had the Bim deletion polymorphism, the PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 4.72-11.86

months) and 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.06-6.14 months;
P 5 .377), respectively. These data are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 2.
A Cox regression analysis was also conducted including only patients in the EGFR-mutant subgroup, because
the Bim polymorphism did not affect PFS significantly in
patients who had WT EGFR. Univariate analysis indicated that sex (women; P 5 .002) and Bim status (WT;
P 5 .004) were associated with longer PFS. Multivariate
analysis demonstrated that Bim status (P 5 .016), together with sex (P 5 .001), was an independent factor in
EGFR-mutated patients who received TKI treatment. All
of the regression data are detailed in Table 5.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first to explore
the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of EGFRTKI outcomes among Chinese patients with NSCLC
who had the Bim deletion polymorphism. The results
indicated that no specific clinicopathologic feature was
associated significantly with distribution of the Bim deletion polymorphism. WT Bim may be an independent factor predicting clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs in
patients with NSCLC who have an activating EGFR
mutation.
In the current study, we observed a Bim polymorphism rate and a distribution pattern similar to that
reported previously.17 Forty-five of 352 patients and 28
of 228 EGFR-mutated patients were identified who harbored this deletion polymorphism. Also, our data demonstrated that the Bim polymorphism was distributed
randomly regardless of disease stage, histologic type, sex,
or EGFR mutation status.
Bim acts as an apoptosis facilitator in response to
stress signals like DNA damage, and it functions irreplaceably in the apoptosis pathway. It is responsible for inducing apoptosis in almost all targeted therapies for various
kinds of tumors (eg, lapatinib in breast cancer, imatinib in
chronic myeloid leukemia).14,19-21 In patients who have
NSCLC with a known driver mutation, the inhibition of
Bim is associated with failure of targeted therapy, and Bim
up-regulation is necessary in successful targeted therapy to
induce apoptosis.22-24
By affecting alternative splicing, this Bim deletion
polymorphism caused impaired expression in its proapoptosis BH3 domain, thus leading to failure of apoptosis
induction. Two previous studies verified the correlation
between the Bim deletion polymorphism and the insufficient efficacy of targeted therapy in the treatment of
patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia using

using EGFR TKIs.17
Our study confirmed the correlation between the
Bim deletion polymorphism and a poor response to
EGFR TKIs in patients with activating EGFR mutations.
2304

In our statistical analysis, we observed that the deletion
polymorphism was related to shorter PFS for the entire
study group compared with WT Bim carriers, mainly
because of poor TKI efficiency in patients with EGFR
mutations who had the Bim deletion polymorphism. Similarly, the ORR was lower in the deletion polymorphism
carriers among EGFR-mutant patients, but not among
patients with WT EGFR (data not shown). This may be
attributed to the inherent poor response to TKIs and short
PFS of patients with NSCLC who harbor WT EGFR. It
also would dilute the predictive power of the Bim deletion
polymorphism. Thus, we concluded that Bim polymorphism status may have influenced the efficacy of TKIs
mainly in our EGFR-mutated patients. This conclusion
was consistent with the finding from a previous study that
Bim is essential for apoptosis triggered by EGFR TKIs in
sensitive populations.16
The outcome of EGFR-mutant patients who had the
exon 19 deletion appeared to be better than the outcome
of those who had the L858R mutation, but the difference
was not significant in our study. Although several previous
studies have demonstrated that patients with the EGFR
exon 19 deletion enjoyed better outcomes than patients
harboring the L858R mutation,26-28 the results from our
study were consistent with several other large clinical trials3,29 indicating that the exon 19 deletion and the L858R
mutation had an equal impact on the efficacy of EGFR
TKIs. Moreover, the PFS of Bim polymorphism carriers
did not differ significantly between the 2 EGFR mutation
types, which indicates that Bim deletion polymorphismCancer

induced TKI resistance may not be influenced by the 2
most common EGFR mutation types.
Recently, a study conducted in Korean patients
with NSCLC did not produce significant results when
comparing the efficacy of EGFR TKIs between patients
with WT Bim and patients with the Bim deletion polymorphism.30 The investigators attributed their results
to population limitations and to the influence of other
Bcl-2 family factors. Another report31 demonstrated
that the resistance can be circumvented by combining
targeted therapy with histone deacetylase inhibition,
which offers a possible explanation for the Korean
results, because epigenetic factors also may influence
the transcription and expression of Bim. Our study also

has several limitations. First, the numbers of patients
who had the deletion polymorphism, especially those
who also harbored EGFR mutations, were limited.
Moreover, all patients who harbored the polymorphism
were heterozygous, and no homozygous carriers have
been reported to date. Future research will continue to
increase the population in the hope of reducing the bias
to some extent and of identifying homozygous Bim
polymorphism carriers. Because Bim plays a key role in
TKI-induced apoptosis, we believe that not only Bim
polymorphism but also other markers of Bim status,
such as copy numbers or protein levels, should be taken
into consideration to make a full evaluation. Further in
vitro and in vivo research will be conducted to explore

epigenetic factors and signal crosstalk that may have an
impact on the expression or function of Bim.
In conclusion, we explored the Bim deletion polymorphism and observed that, in patients who had
NSCLC with EGFR mutations, the Bim deletion polymorphism led to worse PFS, ORR, and disease control
rate. Our work also indicated that this polymorphism can
serve as a predictive factor in TKI therapy for NSCLC.
Although the significance of Bim in targeted therapy has
been noticed for some time, more work is needed to
understand it better.
