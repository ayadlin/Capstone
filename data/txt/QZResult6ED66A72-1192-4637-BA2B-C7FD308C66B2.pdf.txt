Abstract
The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) gene family is essential for DNA replication and is frequently
upregulated in various cancers. Here, we examined the role of MCM2 in prostate cancer and the effect of
microRNA-1296 (miR-1296), genistein, and trichostatin A (TSA) on the MCM complex. Profiling results showed
that expression of MCM genes was higher in tumor samples. Genistein and TSA significantly downregulated
the expression of all MCM genes. Genistein, TSA, and small interfering RNA duplexes caused a significant
decrease in the S phase of the cell cycle. There was also downregulation of CDT1, CDC7, and CDK2 genes,
which govern loading of the MCM complex on chromatin. We also found that miR-1296 was significantly
downregulated in prostate cancer samples. In PC3 cells, inhibition of miR-1296 upregulated both MCM2 mRNA
and protein, whereas overexpression caused a significant decrease in MCM2 mRNA, protein, and the S phase of
the cell cycle. MCM genes are excellent anticancer drug targets because they are essential DNA replication
factors that are highly expressed in cancer cells. This is the first report showing anti-MCM effect by miR-1296,
genistein, and TSA. TSA is undergoing clinical trials as a prostate cancer treatment but has high toxicity.
Genistein, a natural, nontoxic dietary isoflavone, may be an advantageous therapeutic agent for treating
prostate cancer. The use of RNA interference is currently being implemented as a gene-specific approach
for molecular medicine. The specific downregulation of oncogenes by miR may contribute to novel therapeutic
approaches in the treatment of prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2809–18. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
DNA replication occurs in a precise fashion during eukaryotic cell division. This tight control is orchestrated by many
regulatory molecules, including members of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) gene family. Initially, MCM proteins are recruited to sites of DNA replication and interact
with each other, forming the MCM2-MCM7 complex during
the G1 phase of the cell cycle (1). This complex has helicase
activity and facilitates DNA replication (2). Therefore, the
MCM proteins are essential for proliferating cells and are frequently upregulated in a variety of dysplastic and cancer cells
(3, 4). Central to the DNA replication licensing system is the
formation of pre–replicative complexes (pre-RC) in late M
and early G1 phases and their subsequent activation at the
G1-S boundary. Assembly of pre-RCs requires loading of DNA
helicase and the MCM2-MCM7 complex onto chromatin in an

ORC1-6–dependent, CDC6-dependent, and CDT1-dependent
manner (licensing; refs. 5, 6). At the G1-S transition, the activity
of two kinases, CDC7 and cyclin E/A-CDK2, recruits additional
factors to pre-RCs, resulting in the formation of pre–initiation
complexes (pre-IC; refs. 7, 8). In addition, CDC7 and CDK2 activate the putative MCM2-MCM7 helicase, which, together
with pre-IC formation, results in recruitment of DNA polymerases and initiation of DNA replication. The importance
of the replication licensing system is highlighted by the prevalence of genomic instability resulting from hyperactivation of
pre-RCs during the neoplastic process and impaired cell
growth associated with failure to assemble pre-RCs (9).
The MCM2-MCM7 helicase is thought to exist as a hexamer containing individual MCM polypeptides (MCM2/3/4/5/6/
7). MCM2-MCM7 subunits are evolutionarily conserved and
essential genes, with each member possessing conserved
Walker A, Walker B, and arginine finger motifs required for
ATP binding and hydrolysis. The MCM complex is implicated
both in the unwinding of origins of DNA replication during
initiation and in replication fork progression (10). In addition
to the hexamer, MCM subcomplexes (MCM7/4/6, MCM7/4/
6/2, and MCM3/5) have also been reported (9, 11). Within
these subcomplexes, MCM7/4/6 is thought to possess core
ATPase and DNA helicase activity, whereas MCM5/3/2 provides regulatory roles (12). Furthermore, pairwise ATPase
studies in vitro have revealed that MCM3/7, MCM4/7, and
MCM2/6 pairs are able to catalyze ATP hydrolysis (13).
As a hexamer, the ATPase activity of MCM2-MCM7 is not

required for loading of the complex onto chromatin, whereas
ATP hydrolysis by the hexameric complex is essential for
initiation of DNA replication (14).
Because cancer cells are highly proliferative, whereas
differentiated somatic cells are usually withdrawn from the
cell cycle, cell proliferation markers are effective in cancer
diagnosis (15). MCM proteins are good proliferation markers
and are expressed at high levels in proliferating cells but not
in quiescent somatic cells (16). The cellular levels of these
proteins remain constant throughout the cell cycle of proliferating cells (17–20), allowing identification of cancer cells in
all stages of the cell cycle. Most importantly, because replication licensing is essential for a quiescent cell to reenter the
cell cycle, the MCM proteins are expressed as G0 cells enter
the G1 phase even before they engage in active DNA synthesis
(21). Therefore, the MCM proteins can be used to identify
precancerous cells before malignant transformation is
completed, providing more sensitive markers for early
cancer diagnosis. A recent study showed that both MCM2
and Ki67 are expressed at high levels in the high growth fraction of B-cell lymphomas (22). In contrast, only MCM2, but
not Ki67, is expressed at high levels in the low growth
fraction of B-cell lymphomas, indicating that DNA replication licensing occurs in premalignant cells before active
proliferation (22). In the last few years, several MCM
proteins, including MCM5 (23), MCM2 (24–28), and MCM7
(29, 30), are effective molecular markers for proliferating malignant cells in tumors and precancerous cells from premalignant lesions from the lung (26, 27), kidney (31), and
prostate (32). Furthermore, increased expression of MCM2
in prostate (32) and lung cancer cells (26, 27) has been shown
to correspond with poorer patient survival rates, suggesting
that the MCM proteins are sensitive and versatile diagnostic
markers for early cancer detection and promising prognostic
markers for monitoring responsiveness of various cancers to
treatment regimens.
A critical step in anticancer drug development is the
identification of drug targets that are cancer cell specific,
essential for proliferation, and with activities suitable for
high-throughput screens. The MCM complex proteins are a
group of promising candidates that meet all these criteria.
The coupling of expression of the MCM proteins with proliferation offers the potential of identifying drugs with low toxicity. Their essential roles in proliferation make them
effective targets for drugs to kill cancer cells with high potency. Because cell proliferation is a highly conserved cellular
process, anti-MCM molecules may be effective against a
broad spectrum of different cancers regardless of their tissue
or organ of origin. Although anti-MCM small molecules are
most likely to prevent proliferation of cancer cells by blocking replication licensing or DNA synthesis during S phase, a
recent observation suggests that they may also kill cancer by
inducing cancer cell–specific apoptosis (33, 34).
There are no reports on the effect of genistein, a natural,
nontoxic dietary isoflavone, or trichostatin A (TSA), a potent
anticancer drug, on the MCM gene family. In this study,
we show that both genistein and TSA possess an antiMCM effect by causing a significant decrease in MCM2

gene expression in prostate cancer. We undertook a RNA
interference (RNAi) approach to target the MCM2 gene and
studied its functional effects in PC3 and LNCaP prostate
cancer cells, comparing the results with genistein and TSA.
We also showed that microRNA-1296 (miR-1296) regulates
MCM2 expression.

Materials and Methods
Tissue samples and cell culture. Tissue samples from radical prostatectomy were obtained from the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center (San Francisco, CA). Informed consent was
obtained from all patients. A board-certified pathologist processed the specimens and samples were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Human prostate carcinoma cell
lines (LNCaP and PC3) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. The prostate cancer cell lines were
cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 μg/mL penicillin, and
50 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained in an
incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2 at 37°C. Subconfluent cells (60–70% confluent) were
treated with varying concentrations of genistein (0, 25,
and 50 μmol/L; Sigma) dissolved in DMSO for 96 h or TSA
(100 ng/mL; Sigma) for 24 h, and cells treated with vehicle
(DMSO) served as control.
RNA extraction from clinical samples and cell lines.
Total RNA was extracted using a combination of Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Fresh
prostate tissues, however, were homogenized in 1 mL Trizol
reagent. After the addition of 0.2 mL chloroform, samples
were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The aqueous
phase was moved to a new centrifuge tube and resuspended
with one-half volume of 100% ethanol. Samples were then
applied to an RNeasy Mini column. For DNA digestion,
Ambion DNA-Free kit was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality was assessed using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies) spectrophotometer.
Extracted RNA was stored at −80°C. Total RNA was extracted
from 80% confluent plates of cultured cells using a miRNA
easy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Mature miRs and other
mRNAs were assayed using Taqman MicroRNA Assays and
Gene Expression Assays, respectively, in accordance with
the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). All reverse transcription (RT) reactions, including no-template
controls and RT minus controls, were run in a 7500 Fast
Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Samples were
normalized to RNU48 for miR expression or glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for gene expression
normalization (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels
were quantified using the 7500 Fast Real Time Sequence Detection System software (Applied Biosystems). Comparative
real-time PCR was done in triplicate, including no-template
controls. Relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining was done on
tissue microarray slides containing human normal adjacent

and knockdown efficiency. Two siRNA duplexes showing the
greatest knockdown effect were used for further experiments
at 50 nmol/L concentration.

were dual stained with the viability dye 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7-AAD) and Annexin V-FITC using Annexin V-FITC/7-AAD kit
(Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

plated in growth medium without antibiotics at a density
of approximately 40% to 50%. Transient transfection of
miR-1296 at 50 nmol/L concentration was carried out with
Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Untransfected cells, mock, control miR, and a miR-1296

Results
MCM2-MCM7 expression profile. To examine the clinical
relevance of the MCM gene family, their expression was
analyzed in matched carcinoma and normal prostate tissue
samples by Taqman quantitative real-time PCR analysis.
Almost all the carcinoma samples showed higher expression
of all the MCM gene family members compared with their
matched normal samples. Expression of the MCM2 gene
was highest among all other members in prostate cancer
samples (Fig. 1A). Thus, we selected this gene to further confirm its overexpression in carcinomas by doing immunohistochemical staining on tissue microarrays containing
human normal adjacent prostate tissue samples (n = 15),
malignant tumor (n = 72), and metastatic carcinomas
(n = 8). Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays revealed that MCM2 levels generally correlated with prostate
cancer progression (Fig. 1B). In fact, the mean value of
MCM2 expression in metastatic lesions (257 ± 5) was 64.3fold greater than in normal samples (4 ± 2.5) and 2.0-fold
greater than in primary tumors (131 ± 11; Fig. 1C). Staining
was uniformly confined to the nuclear compartment, with
rare cytoplasmic staining. The cells exhibiting staining were

confined to the basal proliferating layer of the prostate
epithelium, whereas stromal cells showed no staining. The
luminal differentiated cells in nonmalignant glands were
rarely positive for MCM2 staining. Prostate cancer is characterized by the loss of the basal cell layer (32). Therefore,
MCM2 staining was evident in the luminal epithelial cells
of malignant glands. Again, stromal cells were not positive
for MCM2 staining. Representative pictures of MCM2 immunohistochemistry and quick score of immunostaining data
are represented in Fig. 1B and C.
Effect of genistein and TSA on the expression of MCM
gene family. Genistein and TSA alone or in combination significantly downregulated the relative expression levels of all
the MCM gene family members compared with the vehicle
control, although the degree of repression varied from one
gene to another in both LNCaP and PC3 cells (Fig. 2A and
B). To verify whether decreased transcription of these genes
resulted in decreased levels of their respective proteins, we
did Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed that
the protein levels of all the MCM gene family were downregulated in genistein- or TSA-treated PC3 and LNCaP cells
(Fig. 2C and D; Supplementary Fig. S1). These results agree
with the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) data and show that
genistein and TSA downregulated transcription and translation of the MCM gene family.
Knockdown of MCM2 by siRNA. To understand the role of
MCM2 downregulation in prostate cancer, we undertook a
siRNA-mediated approach. Initially, three different sets of
siRNA duplexes were tested to evaluate the target specificity
and knockdown efficiency by quantitative real-time PCR
(Fig. 3A). Two siRNA duplexes (S-1 and S-2) showing the
most efficient knockdown were used to further confirm the
efficiency at the protein level (Western blot analysis; Fig. 3B).
Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. FACS analysis was done to test the effect of genistein and TSA on the
cell cycle, and the results were compared with that of the
siRNA duplexes. As summarized in Fig. 4, genistein or TSA
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage
of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle in PC3 (24% to 4%;
Fig. 4A) and LNCaP (14% to 5%; Fig. 4B) cells compared with

vehicle-treated control. Knockdown by siRNA also showed a
decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase from 22% to 2%
(PC3 cells; Fig. 4B) or 14% to 6% (LNCaP cells; Fig. 4B) compared with the nonsilencing siRNA control. There was no
change in the apoptotic population by genistein/TSA or
siRNA duplexes (results not shown).
Effect of genistein and TSA on the expression of genes
that are important for loading of the MCM complex onto
chromatin to facilitate DNA replication. Central to the
DNA replication licensing system is the formation of preRCs. The assembly of pre-RCs requires loading of the
MCM2-MCM7 complex onto chromatin, which depends on
CDT1, CDC7, and CDK2 genes. To check the effect of genistein/TSA on these genes, we did quantitative real-time PCR
and Western blot assays. In PC3 cells, genistein and TSA alone
or in combination significantly downregulated the expression
of CDK2, CDC7, and CDT1 genes at mRNA (Fig. 5A–C) and protein (Fig. 5D) levels compared with the vehicle control. These
results reveal that genistein and TSA have an inhibitory effect
on the DNA replication licensing machinery.
miR-1296 expression is downregulated in prostate
cancer. To examine the clinical relevance of miR-1296, its

2814

Cancer Res; 70(7) April 1, 2010

expression was analyzed in carcinoma (n = 23) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 24) tissue samples. Almost all the carcinoma samples showed highly reduced miR-1296 expression
with respect to the BPH samples, and an overall lower relative
average expression was observed in carcinoma compared with
BPH samples (Fig. 6A). Transient transfection with miR-1296 at
50 nmol/L concentration in PC3 prostate cancer cells for 72
hours resulted in a 500,000-fold induction in miR-1296 expression in comparison with the control miR (data not shown).
miR-1296 targets MCM2. To find out whether MCM2 is a
target of miR-1296, we used online search tools miRanda and
identified a target site with high complementarity to miR1296 in 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of MCM2. Overall, the
alignment score is 140, with a perfect match to the seed heptamer (Fig. 6B, 1). MCM2 proved to be sensitive to miR-1296,
and a significant decrease (51%) in MCM2 mRNA expression
levels was observed in miR-1296–transfected cells (Fig. 6B, 2).
Western blot analysis confirmed that MCM2 protein levels
were also reduced in response to miR-1296 transfection
(Fig. 6B, 3). Taken together, these data suggest that miR1296 reduces MCM2 expression by inhibiting translation
and/or causing mRNA instability/decay.

We also transfected cells with a miR-1296 inhibitor (anti–
miR-1296; Applied Biosystems) designed specifically to bind
and sequester mature miR-1296. The miR-1296 inhibitor
helped preserve MCM2 expression at both the mRNA and
the protein levels (Fig. 6B, 2 and 3). Taken together, these
results indicate that the MCM2 transcript is a target of
miR-1296.
miR-1296 decreases the number of S-phase cells. FACS
analysis was done on miR-1296–transfected PC3 cells to test
its effect on the cell cycle. miR-1296 caused a significant decrease in the percentage of S-phase cells (from 15% to 2%) compared with control miR, untransfected, and mock-transfected
controls (Fig. 6C). We also did a quantitative real-time PCR
assay to check the effect of genistein on miR-1296 expression.
A synergistic effect of genistein on miR-1296 was observed, as
there was an increase in miR-1296 expression of 3- to 5-fold
with 25 or 50 μmol/L genistein (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Cancer cells are highly proliferative; therefore, cell proliferation markers are very effective and attractive as cancer
diagnostic markers (15). At present, MCM proteins are very
good proliferation markers and are highly expressed in prolif-

erating cells versus quiescent somatic cells (16), thus allowing
for the identification of malignant cancer cells. In this study,
we show that both genistein and TSA have an anti-MCM complex effect, causing the highest decrease in expression of
MCM2 in prostate cancer cells. We also used a RNAi approach
to target the MCM2 gene to examine its functional aspects in
prostate cancer cells and compare the results with that of genistein and TSA. We found that miR-1296 is downregulated in
prostate cancer and that MCM2 is one of its targets.
Genistein is believed to be a potent anticancer agent and
has been shown to have antitumor effects in animal models
(35). Various soy products containing genistein have been
found to inhibit the growth of transplanted human prostate
carcinoma, reduce the incidence of poorly differentiated
prostate adenocarcinoma in a transgenic mouse model, and
inhibit 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine–
induced rat prostate cancer (36). Carcinogenesis or metastasis to the stomach, colon, bladder, and lung is also inhibited
by genistein and related isoflavones (37–39). TSA, a histone
deacetylase inhibitor and a potent anticancer drug, is currently undergoing clinical trials as a prostate cancer treatment but has high toxicity. Currently, there are no reports
on the effect of genistein, a natural, nontoxic dietary isoflavone, or TSA on the MCM gene family. We found expression

of MCM genes to be higher in prostate cancer compared
with normal tissues. The MCM proteins are essential DNA
replication factors that are highly expressed in malignant
cancer and precancerous cells but downregulated in differentiated somatic cells (16, 26, 27, 32). Treatment with genistein or TSA alone or in combination significantly
downregulated the expression of the MCM gene family in
both androgen-dependent LNCaP or androgen-independent
PC3 cells.
Drugs targeting MCM proteins are likely to prevent the
proliferation of cancer cells by blocking replication licensing
or DNA synthesis during the S phase (40). Our results show
that genistein, TSA, and siRNA decreased the S phase of the
cell cycle in both LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells. It has
been reported that when the negative regulator of replication
licensing, geminin, is overexpressed in human primary cells,
loading of the MCM complex to the chromatin is prevented
and the cells are blocked in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (33,
34). A “licensing checkpoint” may exist in normal human
cells, which blocks S-phase entry if replication licensing is incomplete or compromised (33, 34). Cancer cells, on the other
hand, are defective in this checkpoint. When treated with
anti-MCM drugs that compromise DNA replication licensing,

they enter the S phase with underlicensed G1 chromatin and
are eliminated (40).
The loading of the MCM2-MCM7 complex is dependent on
CDT1 (licensing; refs. 5, 6), CDC7, and CDK2 that recruit additional factors to pre-RCs, resulting in the formation of preICs (7, 8). In addition, CDC7 and CDK2 activate the putative
MCM2-MCM7 helicase, which, together with pre-IC formation, results in recruitment of DNA polymerases and initiation of DNA replication. Our results show that both
genistein and TSA alone or in combination significantly
downregulated the expression of CDK2, CDC7, and CDT1
genes at the mRNA and protein levels compared with the vehicle control. These results show that genistein and TSA have
inhibitory effects on the DNA replication licensing machinery
in prostate cancer.
miRs are a class of naturally occurring small noncoding
RNAs that control gene expression by binding to sites in
the 3′-UTRs of target transcripts, resulting in translational
arrest and, in some instances, transcript degradation (41).
Recent estimates suggest that one third of human mRNAs
may be regulated by miRs (42). Studies have found that
miR expression patterns are significantly different in normal
and neoplastic tissues, suggesting that miRs may play a role

Regulation of MCM Gene Family in Prostate Cancer

in tumorigenesis (43). In human cancers, some miRs may
have an oncogenic function due to their overexpression in
malignant tissue, whereas certain miRs may act as tumor
suppressor genes because of decreased expression (43). Differential expression of miRs has been reported in prostate
cancer (44). We searched the online database to look for
miRs that regulate MCM2 and found that miR-1296 has a perfect seed complimentary sequence in the 3′-UTR of the
MCM2 gene. The expression of miR-1296 was significantly
lower in prostate tumors than BPH tissues. Transfection of
miR-1296 in PC3 prostate cancer cells decreased the expression of MCM2 mRNA and protein. To further validate that
miR-1296 inhibits MCM2 expression in prostate cancer, we
transfected PC3 cells with the miR-1296 inhibitor, which is
designed specifically to bind and sequester the mature
miR-1296 sequence. MCM2 mRNA expression in miR-1296 inhibitor–transfected cells was upregulated relative to control
miR–tansfected cells. MCM2 protein expression was also upregulated in miR-1296 inhibitor–transfected cells. These results show that inhibition of miR-1296 upregulated MCM2
mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer cells, confirming that miR-1296 inhibits expression of the MCM2 gene.
We also observed a significant decrease in S-phase cells in
response to miR-1296 compared with controls. Genistein
had a positive effect on miR-1296, as there was an increase
of 3- to 5-fold in miR-1296 expression compared with vehicle
control.
MCM proteins are sensitive markers for early cancer diagnosis. Their essential role in cancer cell proliferation makes
them attractive therapeutic drug targets. Because cell proliferation is a highly conserved cellular process, anti-MCM
drugs may be effective against a broad spectrum of cancers,
regardless of their organ or tissue of origin. Our study clearly
showed that genistein, a natural, nontoxic dietary isoflavone,

has anti-MCM effects in prostate cancer. We also found that
MCM2 is a target of miR-1296. To our knowledge, this is the
first report showing the effect of genistein on the MCM licensing gene family in prostate cancer. TSA is currently undergoing clinical trials as a prostate cancer treatment but has
high toxicity. Genistein, a natural, nontoxic dietary isoflavone, may be an advantageous therapeutic agent for treating
prostate cancer. The use of RNAi is currently being implemented as a gene-specific approach for molecular medicine.
By the same principle, the specific downregulation of oncogenic genes by miR may contribute to the growing therapeutic potential that small RNA-based drugs have in the
treatment of cancer and other diseases. It is possible that
stimulation of silenced miRs by drug treatment may lead
to the downregulation of target oncogenes, thereby contributing to novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of
prostate cancer.
