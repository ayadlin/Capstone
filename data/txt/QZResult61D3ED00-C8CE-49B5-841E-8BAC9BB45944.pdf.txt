ABSTRACT
Upregulated expression and activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) is a hallmarker of lung tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism underlying
the aberrant hTERT activity in lung cancer cells remains poorly understood. In this
study, we found the transcriptional co-activator CBP as a new hTERT promoterbinding protein that regulated hTERT expression and tumor growth in lung
adenocarcinoma cells using a biotin-streptavidin-bead pulldown technique. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay verified the immortalized cell and tumor cell-specific
binding of CBP on hTERT promoter. Overexpression of exogenous CBP upregulated
the expression of the hTERT promoter-driven luciferase and endogenous hTERT
protein in lung cancer cells. Conversely, inhibition of CBP by CBP-specific siRNA or its
chemical inhibitor repressed the expression of hTERT promoter-driven luciferase and
endogenous hTERT protein as well as telomerase activity. Moreover, inhibition of CBP
expression or activity also significantly reduced the proliferation of lung cancer cells
in vitro and tumor growth in an xenograft mouse model in vivo. Immunohistochemical
analysis of tissue microarrays of lung cancers revealed a positive correlation between
CBP and hTERT. Importantly, the patients with high CBP and hTERT expression had
a significantly shorter overall survival. Furthermore, CBP was found to interact with
and acetylate transactivator Sp1 in lung cancer cells. Inhibition of CBP by CBP-specific
siRNA or its chemical inhibitor significantly inhibited Sp1 acetylation and its binding
to the hTERT promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that CBP contributes to the
upregulation of hTERT expression and tumor growth, and overexpression of CBP
predicts poor prognosis in human lung cancers.

important roles in tumorigenesis and development [1,2,3].

are required for maintaining integrity of the chromosomes.
They are shortened at each cell division. Telomerase is
a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of RNA and
human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). It uses
its own RNA as template to synthesize telomeres, and
then add telomeres to the ends of chromosomes to extend
the shortened telomeres and enhance cell proliferation,
thereby promoting cellular immortalization. High activity
of telomerase has been implicated in maintaining telomere
stability, genome integrity, cell activity, potential longterm proliferative ability and other aspects in cancer
cells [4,5]. Telomerase activity is usually low or under
detection in normal human cells except human embryonic
stem cells and germ cells, but it is highly activated in the
immortalized cells and more than 85% of tumor cells
during malignant transformation [6-12].
As the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT
determines the activity of telomerase[13]. Multiple
transcription factor binding sites exist in the hTERT
promoter region, and it is recognized that its expression is
tightly controlled by these regulatory factors [14]. Many
oncogenes, such as c-Myc, Sp1, HIF-1, AP-2, Estrogen
receptor, and IRF1, could function as transcriptional
factors to stimulate the expression of hTERT, while
many tumor suppressors, such as p53, WT1, Menin and
SMAD3, inhibit hTERT transcriptional activation by
binding to special promoter sites [15-17]. In addition,
the demethylation of histones at promoter region could
also promote the expression of hTERT under the action
of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) [18]. However, how
hTERT activity is silenced in normal cells and reactivated
during the process of carcinogenesis is still unclear. We
speculate that certain transcription factors or regulatory
factors differentially or selectively bind to the hTERT
promoter region in human cancer cells compared with
normal cells to promote hTERT expression and telomerase
activity, and thus to regulate tumor development.
CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a highly conserved
transcriptional coactivator, which shares similar structure
with its paralog, E1A-binding protein (p300). They both
have four separate transactivation domains that interact
with general transcription factors as well as DNA-binding
transcription activators to mediate the recruitment of basal
transcriptional machinery to the promoter and increase
the expression of their target genes [19,20]. CBP/p300
also contains histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity,
which is able to relax chromatin’s superstructure and
promote expression of the proximal genes. In addition,
the HAT activity of CBP/p300 could also acetylate some
transcription factors and further modulate their functions
[21]. Based on their interactions with histones and a large
number of transcriptional factors, CBP/p300 have been
found to be implicated in many complex pathological
and physiological processes, including cancers [22, 23].
By activating some oncogenes, such as c-Myc, c-Myb
and AR, CBP/p300 can promote cell proliferation and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer development. For example, CBP/p300 promotes
prostate cancer progression by activating AR-dependent
transcription [24]. CBP is also associated with breast
cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) drug
resistance by interacting with β-catenin [25,26]. However,
whether CBP or p300 regulates lung tumorigenesis and
development by modulating hTERT signaling as well as
the exact underlying mechanisms are largely unknown.
In this study, we have found the high expression
of CBP and hTERT in lung tumor cells and tissues.
Therefore, we hypothesize that the differentially expressed
CBP may specifically bind to the hTERT promoter to
regulate hTERT expression and tumor growth in lung
cancer cells. Previous study has also shown that hTERT
expression is dependently regulated by activating
specificity protein 1 (Sp1) in human lung cancer cells [27].
Given these findings and the possibly potential correlation
between CBP and hTERT expression in lung cancer, in
this study, we investigated whether CBP might play a
regulatory role in hTERT expression in lung cancer cells
as transcriptional co-activator through cooperation with
some specific transcriptional factors such as Sp1. Since
hTERT expression is closely related to carcinogenesis and
strictly controlled at the transcription level, our findings
will reveal the new function of CBP as a tumor-specific
transcriptional co-activator to regulate hTERT expression
and tumor growth in human lung cancer cells.

RESULTS
Detection of CBP as a hTERT promoter-binding
protein in lung cancer cells
We designed and synthesized a 438 bp biotinconjugated double stranded DNA oligonucleotide probe
corresponding to -378 to +60 site of hTERT gene promoter
region. The biotinylated hTERT promoter probe can be
specifically connected to the agarose beads coated with
streptavidin. We then incubated the cell nuclear extract
proteins with streptavidin-agarose beads coated with the
hTERT probe. The hTERT promoter-binding proteins
were purified and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins
of interests were detected by immunoblot analysis using
the specific antibodies. CBP was identified as a hTERT
promoter-binding protein and detected in the complexes
prepared from human lung cancer H1299 and A549 cells
and the immortalized HBE cells, but not from the normal
lung HLF cells (Fig. 1A).
To further verify that CBP binds to the hTERT
promoter specifically in cancer and immortalized cells,
we also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay to detect the binding of CBP to the endogenous
hTERT promoter. As we expected, more chromatin hTERT
promoter DNA were amplified in lung cancer A549 and

H1299 cells and immortalized HBE cells than those in
normal lung HLF cells when a CBP antibody was used in
the ChIP assay (Fig. 1B), whereas nearly no DNA-binding
was detected when a control normal IgG was used. The
results demonstrated the tumor and immortalized cellspecific binding of CBP to the hTERT promoter in lung
cancer cells.

To further confirm the role of CBP in regulating
hTERT expression, we evaluated the effect of CBP on
hTERT protein expression and telomerase activity in lung
cancer H1299 cells. Ectopic expression of CBP increased
not only CBP itself, but also hTERT protein levels in
H1299 cells (Fig. 2C). Conversely, the downregulation of
CBP expression by CBP siRNA suppressed hTERT protein
expression (Fig. 2D). Moreover, knockdown of CBP by
siRNA or inhibition of its activity by a CBP-selective
inhibitor significantly repressed the telomerase activity in
H1299 cells (Fig. 2E). These findings suggest that CBP
exerts a positive role in the regulation of hTERT protein
expression and telomerase activity.

Regulation of hTERT promoter activity by CBP
in lung cancer cells
To understand whether CBP functions as a
transcriptional co-activator to regulate hTERT promoter
activity, lung cancer cells H1299 were transfected with
plasmids expressing CBP and a luciferase reporter driven
by the hTERT promoter, and then assayed for the activity
of luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression
of CBP upregulated the activity of hTERT promoterdriven luciferase in H1299 cells co-transfected with CBP
and hTERT-luciferase plasmids compared with that in cells
co-transfected with LacZ and hTERT-luciferase plasmids.
In contrast, siRNA knockdown of CBP expression or CBP
inhibitor treatment significantly attenuated the activity
of hTERT promoter-driven luciferase in H1299 cells cotreated with hTERT-luciferase and a CBP-specific siRNA
or inhibitor compared with those in cells co-treated
with the non-specific siRNA (NSP siRNA) and hTERTluciferase plasmid (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated
that CBP might serve as a transcriptional co-activator in
the activation of hTERT promoter in lung cancer cells.

Regulation of lung cancer growth by CBP in vitro
and in vivo
Telomerase is implicated in tumor progression and
has become a potential target of cancer therapy. Our data
so far have indicated that CBP might be involved in lung
cancer cell proliferation through the regulation of hTERT.
To test this, we first tested the effect of the CBP on cell
proliferation in H1299 cells in vitro. Overexpression
of CBP effectively promoted H1299 cell proliferation
as compared to the control LacZ group(Fig. 3A). By
contrast, inhibition of CBP expression by a CBP-specific
siRNA or a CBP-selective inhibitor significantly inhibited
the proliferation of H1299 cells (Fig. 3B). These results
suggest an important role of CBP in sustaining lung cancer
cell proliferation.

Overexpression of CBP and hTERT in lung
cancer cells

We then evaluated the effect of CBP on lung
tumor growth using an xenograft mouse model bearing
lung tumors. As shown in Fig. 3C, knockdown of CBP
expression dramatically suppressed tumor growth in
human lung cancer mouse model in vivo in comparison
with the non-specific control siRNA (NSP-siRNA)
treatment, demonstrating the role of CBP in the regulation
of lung cancer growth in vivo.
We also analyzed the correlation between CBP and
hTERT protein expression in tumor tissues of xenografts
by immunohistochemical staining analysis. The results
showed that downregulation of CBP by siRNA markedly
decreased hTERT protein expression compared with the
control NSP siRNA treatment in xenografts (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that CBP-mediated tumor growth in vivo is
likely regulated by hTERT.

To determine how tumor cells differentially activate
hTERT expression, we detected the expression of hTERT
and transcriptional co-activator CBP at protein levels
in human lung cancer and normal cells by Western blot
analysis. The hTERT expression was detected in cytosol
(Fig. 4A), and CBP was detected in nuclei (Fig. 4B).
Compared to the normal HLF cells, CBP protein was
obviously highly expressed in lung cancer cell lines A549
and H1299 and in the immortalized cell line HBE (Fig.
4B). Similarly, hTERT protein was also expressed at a
comparatively high level in A549, H1299 and HBE cells
(Fig. 4A).
We also tested the expression and localization
of CBP by an immunofluorescent staining. Consistent
with the results from Western blot analysis, nearly no

expression of CBP was found in normal HLF cells, but
high expression was found in the nuclei of both A549 and
H1299 cells and in the immortalized cell line HBE (Fig.
4C).
To further investigate the regulation of hTERT by
CBP in lung cancer, we next analyzed the expression of
CBP and hTERT proteins in lung tumor and normal lung
tissues of patients by immunohistochemical staining. As
shown in Fig. 4D, both CBP and hTERT were highly
expressed in lung tumor tissues compared with the normal
lung tissues in all three tested patients. These results
indicate the very possible positive correlation between
CBP and hTERT, and verified the potential regulation of
hTERT expression by CBP in lung cancer.

We analyzed the expression of CBP and hTERT
proteins in lung tumor and normal lung tissues by
immunohistochemical assay in 75 cases of patients with
lung cancers. The percentage of the cases with both
CBP and hTERT high expression nearly reached 73%
based on the total number of the studied cases (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, the analysis by a Pearson’s correlation
coefficient test showed that CBP expression was
statistically positively correlated with hTERT expression,
giving a Pearson R value of 0.785 (Fig. 5B), suggesting
a high significance of CBP expression level and its
positive correlation with hTERT in lung adenocarcinoma
development.

We further analyzed the effect of CBP expression on
the survival rate of patients with lung adenocarcinomas.
The overall survival curve analysis indicated a relative
poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinomas patients with
high CBP expression compared to those with weak CBP
expression (Fig. 5C). Moreover, lung adenocarcinomas
patients with very weak or negative CBP and hTERT
expression have nearly 100% survival rate of 8 years
after diagnosis, but the survival rate for the patients with
both high CBP and hTERT expression was lowered to
50% 5 years after diagnosis (Fig. 5D), suggesting the
important role of CBP expression and its association with
hTERT in predicting the prognosis of patients with lung
adenocarcinomas.

specifically binds to hTERT promoter through serving
as a transcriptional co-activator and interacting with the
transactivators which bind to the hTERT promoter and
differentially activates hTERT expression in lung cancer
cells, we analyzed the direct interaction of CBP with two
transactivators Sp1 and AP-2 bound to hTERT promoter
by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Nuclear extracts from
normal lung HLF cells, immotolized HBE cells and lung
cancer cells (H1299, A549) were prepared and incubated
with a Sp1 or AP-2β antibody. After immunoprecipitation,
CBP protein was tested by Western blot. As shown in
Fig. 6A, the CBP complexed with Sp1 or AP-2β was
detected and considerably increased in lung cancer cell
lines compared with that in normal lung cells. These
results indicated the specific interaction between CBP and
Sp1 or AP-2β in the nucleus of lung cancer cells. Dual
immunofluorescence analysis was also used to further
analyze the colocalization of CBP with Sp1 and AP2β(Fig. 6B). The results showed that CBP was colocalized
with both Sp1 and AP-2β proteins in H1299 cells in
the nucleus. The results indicated again the association
between CBP and transactivators Sp1 and AP-2 in lung

Binding of Sp1 on hTERT promoter in lung
cancer cells

Acetylation of Sp1 by CBP in lung cancer cells
CBP has a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity.
To determine whether CBP can acetylate transactivators
bound to hTERT promoter, we immunoprecipitated the
nuclear extracts from lung normal and cancer cell lines
using anti-Sp1 antibody. The acetylation levels of Sp1
was tested using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. The
comparatively higher level of the acetylated Sp1 protein
was detected in lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1299)
than that in normal lung cell lines (HLF) (Fig. 6E).
To determine whether CBP mediated the acetylation
of the transactivators bound on hTERT promoter, we
tested the effect of CBP on the acetylation level of the
transactivator Sp1 in H1299 lung cancer cells. Knockdown
of CBP by its specific siRNA or inhibition of CBP activity
by its specific inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease in
the acetylated level of Sp1 (Fig. 6F). The results indicate

It has been shown that the transactivators, such as
Sp1 and AP-2, regulate the transcription of hTERT gene
[30]. We next selected Sp1 to test its possible binding on
the hTERT promoter region through streptavidin-agarose
pulldown analysis. The cell nuclear extracts, biotinylated
hTERT promoter probes and streptavidin-agarose beads
were mixed and incubated. The Sp1 bound on the hTERT
promoter probes was detected from the formed complexes
by western blot. As shown in Fig. 6C, Sp1 was detected
in the complexes from all the four tested cell lines. We
also confirmed the binding of Sp1 on hTERT promoter
region by ChIP assay using the specific antibody against
Sp1. The hTERT promoter was amplified from the Sp1
antibody-immunoprecipitated samples in all the tested cell
lines (Fig. 6D). Moreover, we found that the cancer cell
lines (A549 and H1299) had the strong binding activity of

DISCUSSION

that CBP mediates the tumor-specific acetylation of Sp1
in lung cancer cells.
We also tested the effect of CBP on the binding
of Sp1 to hTERT promoter by pulldown analysis. The
comparatively attenuated Sp1 protein was detected in
the cells treated with CBP-specific siRNA or inhibitor
compared with those in the PBS or non-specific siRNA
(NSC-siRNA)-treated cells (Fig. 6G). These results
indicate the immortalized and tumor cell-specific binding
between hTERT promoter and CBP and Sp1, and potential
requirement of CBP in the accumulation of Sp1 at the
hTERT promoter.

More and more studies have established the strong
positive correlation between the relatively high expression
and activation of hTERT and oncogenesis [31-34], and
proposed hTERT as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
Therefore, it is reasonable and significant to reveal the
molecular mechanisms of the tumor-specific expression
and activation of hTERT. Various cellular factors,
including transcription factors and some intracellular
signaling molecules, have been confirmed to be able to
regulate hTERT expression in cancer cells by binding to

hTERT promoter [15-17, 35-37]. The aim of our study was
to understand the molecular mechanism of transcriptional
regulation for the observed increased expression of hTERT
in non-small cell lung cancer cells and further assess its
role in non-small cell lung cancer tumorigenesis and
development.
With regard to the new insight into the mechanisms
involved in hTERT expression regulation in lung cancer,
we have demonstrated for the first time that hTERT
transcription activation is dependent on CBP. CBP
was found to express at significantly higher level in
immortalized lung and adenocarcinoma cells than that
in normal lung cells in vitro and in vivo in our study.
In addition, our results showed that the level of CBP
expression was strongly correlated with the levels of
hTERT expression in lung adenocarcinomas specimens,
further supporting the importance of CBP in regulation
of hTERT expression in lung cancer. Furthermore, the
overexpression or knocked down expression of CBP
significantly promoted or attenuated hTERT promoterdriven luciferase gene expression in H1299 cell line,
partially indicating the positive regulation role of CBP on
hTERT promoter. While the streptavidin-agarose pulldown
and ChIP assay clearly indicated the direct or indirect
binding of CBP to hTERT promoter, the data further
approved the regulation of CBP on hTERT promoter.
As a transcriptional co-activator, CBP plays its
role to regulate the expression of the targeted genes
through mediating the recruitment of basal transcriptional
machinery to the promoter either by interacting with these
transcriptional factors directly or by acetylating histones
and other transcription factors indirectly. Based on the
result of the binding of CBP to hTERT promoter from
pulldown assay, we hypothesized CBP might regulate
hTERT transcription as co-activator in the ways of direct
interaction with some special transcriptional factors or
acetylating partial transcriptional factors first and then
recruiting them to hTERT promoter. The upregulated
expression of Sp1 was observed in lung cancer cells than
that in normal lung cells in our study (data not shown), and
its binding to hTERT promoter was confirmed by pulldown
assay in lung adenocarcinomas cells. Furthermore, we
also found that the interaction and colocalization between
Sp1 and CBP using immunoprecipitation assay and
immunofluorescence assay. All of these results suggest
that the transcriptional regulation of hTERT expression by
CBP might occur through the recruitment of some special
transcriptional factors, possibly Sp1 to hTERT promoter
region.
In our study, we also found that the inhibition of
histone acetyltransferase activity by CBP significantly
lowered the binding of Sp1 to hTERT promoter as
well as the level of acetylated Sp1, suggesting that the
acetylation of Sp1 by CBP might be required to initiate the
transcriptional activating mechanism of hTERT promoter
in lung cancer cells. More transcriptional factors, besides
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sp1, might also be required to lead to transcriptional
activation of the hTERT promoter through the recruitment
of CBP and binding to hTERT promoter. We will further
investigate these questions in our subsequent research.
We also found that CBP was overexpressed in lung
cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues. Importantly,
lung cancer patients with strong positive expression of
CBP showed shorter survival time after diagnosis when
compared to those with weak CBP expression. Even more
meaningful, the expression level of CBP was almost
positively correlated with hTERT expression level in lung
cancer patients, and the knockdown of CBP by siRNA
significantly decreased hTERT activity and inhibited lung
tumor cell growth, indicating the key role of CBP involved
in lung cancer development and progression.
In summary, we found that hTERT induction in lung
cancer cells was partially mediated through a mechanism
whereby CBP binds and activates the hTERT promoter.
We also revealed that CBP interacts with and acetylates
Sp1, thereby transactivating hTERT promoter and
initiating hTERT expression, which is involved in lung
cancer development. Since CBP is nearly not expressed
in normal lung cells and highly expressed in lung cancer
cells, and its expression level is positively correlated with
hTERT expression and inversely proportional to patient
survival, it might represent a promising therapeutic target
to inhibit hTERT activity and lung tumorigenesis.

A549), immortalized human lung bronchial epithelial cell
line (HBE), and human normal lung fibroblast (HLF),
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA). H1299 and A549 were cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Thermo Scientific)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HBE and
HLF cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained in
a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis of the whole cell lysate with an
antibody against hTERT (Millipore USA), β-Actin (Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and of the nuclear
extracts with an antibody against Sp1, AP-2β (Santa
Cruz, USA), CBP (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA) were performed. The protein bands were detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s

Telomerase activity assays

instructions.

Plasmid vectors

Telomerase activity was analyzed by telomerase
PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche
Applied Science) as described previously [28].

Recombinant plasmid vectors pGL3-hTERT-438
expressing luciferase driven by a hTERT promoter
(-378 to +60) were constructed in our lab and used in
the transfection experiments. The CBP overexpression
vector, pcDNA3.1-CBP or control vector pcDNA3.1-Lac
Z plasmids were designed and synthesized by Cyagen
(Cyagen Biosciences Inc., United States).

Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v)
for 4 min, quenched for 20 min with 50 mM NH4Cl in
PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% (w/v) TritonX-100
in PBS for 5min. The blocking step was performed for
30 mins in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) (w/v). Cells were then incubated overnight with
the primary antibodies against CBP, Sp1 diluted in PBS
containing 1% BSA. After PBS washings, cells were
incubated for 2 h with secondary antibodies conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555. CBP and Sp1
protein localization was assessed using a Leica confocal
microscopy (Model TCS-NT). Files of microphotographs
were processed with the Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software
(San Jose, CA, USA).

Transient transfection of lung cancer cells
To overexpress CBP in H1299 cells, pcDNA3.1CBP or control vector plasmids were transfected with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To
inhibit CBP expression, H1299 cells were transfected with
CBP specific siRNA (10µmol/L, Santa Cruz, sc-29244,
siRNA-1 and OriGene, SR300976, siRNA-2); nonspecific
siRNA (10µmol/L, Santa Cruz, sc-44230). Forty-eight
hours post-transfection, cytoplasm and nuclear fractions
were isolated [28], and proteins were tested using western
blot analysis.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays

Treatment of lung cancer cells with CBP inhibitor

Equal amounts of nuclei protein extracts prepared
from different cell lines were incubated with the
antibodies against Sp1, AP-2β and CBP for 24 h at 4°C.
Then, the agarose-conjugated protein-A/G beads (Santa
Cruz Biotech) were added and the mixture was incubated
at 4°C for another 12h. After extensive washing with
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the beads were
mixed with loading buffer and boiled. The proteins in the
supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to PVDF membranes for Western blotting analysis.

To inhibit the histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
activity of CBP in H1299 cells, c646, a competitive HAT
CBP inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, SML0002), was used to
treat H1299 cells. 48 hours after treatment, cytoplasm and
nuclear fractions were isolated, and protein activities were
analyzed.

Promoter activity and dual-luciferase assay

Streptavidin-agarose pulldown assay

Cells (2×105 cells/well) were seeded into six-well
plates, cultured overnight, and transfected with the hTERT
promoter-luciferase plasmids (1μg pGL3-hTERT-400
plasmids per well) mediated by Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Meanwhile, cells were
cotransfected with either CBP overexpression vector
or CBP specific siRNA (pcDNA3.1-CBP, or control
vector pcDNA3.1-Lac Z plasmids; CBP specific siRNA
or nonspecific siRNA). Transfection efficiency was
normalized by co-transfection with Renilla luciferase
reporter. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were
quantified using a dual-luciferase assay system (Promega
Corp., Madison, WI).

Binding of transcriptional factors or co-activators
to hTERT promoter DNA was assayed by streptavidinagarose pulldown using a biotin-labeled double-strand
DNA probes corresponding to hTERT promoter sequence
-378 to +60 and synthesized by Sigma-aldrich (St.Louis,
MO) as described previously [28]. Briefly, cells were
grown to 80-90% confluence in 150-cm2 flasks and
nuclear extracts were prepared [29]. The binding assay
was performed by mixing 400µg nuclear extract proteins,
10ug DNA probes, and 100µl streptavidin-agarose beads
(Sigma-aldrich, American). The mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 6h with shaking and centrifuged at
500g to pull down the DNA-protein complex. The bound
proteins were washed by cold PBS three times and further
eluted by being boiled at 95°C for 5 mins for Western blot
analysis.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)

Human lung adenocarcinoma specimens

The ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP
IT Express kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the
cells were “fixed” with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated
on ice to shear the DNA to 200 bp to 500 bp. Onethird of the total cell lysate was used as the DNA input
control. The remaining two thirds of the lysate were
subjected to immunoprecipitations with anti-CBP, antiSp1 antibodies or non-immune rabbit IgG. The DNA
was subjected to PCR to amplify a 438 bp region (-378
to +60 bp) of the hTERT promoter using the primers
(5’- TGGCCCCTCCCTCGGGTTAC-3’ and 5’CCAGGGCTTCCCACGTGCGC-3’). The PCR products
were resolved electrophoretically on a 2% agarose gel and
visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Human lung adenocarcinomas tissue microarray
was purchased from Shanghai Outdo Biotech (Shanghai,
China) and contains 150 lung adenocarcinomas and
their corresponding adjacent non-malignant normal
lung tissues. The immunostaining analysis of CBP and
hTERT protein expression was done based on these tissue
microarrays. The extent of the staining was used as criteria
of evaluation. For each tissue sample, protein expression
was scored according to the staining color: negative
staining (no yellow); low staining(light yellow); moderate
or high staining( yellowish brown or brown). Overall
survival (OS) was calculated from the day of surgery to
the day of death or to the last follow-up day. With prior
written consent from patients, all the tissue samples had
been obtained before anticancer treatment.

Cell viability assay

Immunohistochemistry staining

Cell viability was determined by MTT assay
(Roche Diagnosis, Indianapolis, IN) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, H1299 cells plated in 96well plates (2000 cells/well) were treated with pcDNA3.1CBP, or control vector pcDNA3.1-Lac Z, CBP siRNA or
control siRNA (50 nmol/L). At different time points after
treatment, cell viability was determined.

The tissue microarray (TMA) slides were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded
alcohol. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating
samples with citrate buffer (0.1mol/L, pH 6.0) for 90
minutes (for hTERT detection) and with Target Retrieval
Solution (pH 9; DakoCytomation) for 15 minutes (for
CBP detection) using a pressure cooker. The slides were
then immersed in methanol containing 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 20 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. After preincubation in 2.5% blocking serum to
reduce nonspecific binding, the sections were incubated
overnight using a primary antibody, either anti-CBP
(#7389, CST, 1:50 dilution), or anti-hTERT antibody
(#MABE14, MILLIPORE, 1:50 dilution), in a humidified
container at 4°C. The TMA slides were processed with
horseradish peroxidase immunochemistry according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations (DakoCytomation,
Carpinteria, CA ). As a negative control, the staining
procedure was performed with the primary antibody
replaced by a normal rabbit IgG. Since CBP and hTERT
protein were mainly detected in the nuclei of cancer
cells, nuclear staining intensity was graded as: absent
staining as 0, weak as 1, moderate as 2, and strong as
3. The percentage of stained cells was graded as: 0 (no
positive cells), 1 (<25% positive cells), 2 (25%–50%
positive cells), 3 (50%–75% positive cells), and 4 (>75%
positive cells). The score for each tissue was calculated by
multiplying the intensity and the percentage value (range,
0–12). The median immunohistochemical staining score
was used as the cutoff value for tumor “high expression”.
CBP and hTERT expression were classified as high level
(score ≥ 7) or low level (score ≤ 6).

In vivo tumor model and tissue processing
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, with the approval of
the Animal Research Committee of Dalian Medical
University. CBP siRNA and negative control siRNA for in
vivo delivery were obtained from Santa Cruz Co (USA).
To investigate the effect of CBP inhibition on lung cancer
cell growth in vivo, A549 cells (2x106) were inoculated
subcutaneously into the flank of the nude mice. Mice were
randomly divided into 2 groups (5 mice per group): (a)
control siRNA and (b) CBP siRNA. Treatment was started
2 weeks after injection. For delivery of siRNA complexed
with liposome, the complexes with 10 nmol RNA in 0.1
ml 5% glucose were injected intratumorally twice a week
for 3 weeks. The tumor volume in mm3 was calculated
as V = (width2 × length)/2 using digital calipers and the
tumor weight was recorded after the mice were sacrificed.
Tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in
paraffin for CBP and hTERT protein expression analysis
through the immunohistochemical staining described
below.

Statistical analysis

8.	

Student’s t-test was used to compare two
independent groups of data. Chi-square tests were applied
to analyze the association between CBP and hTERT
abundance. Survival curves were constructed using the
Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the logrank test. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
16.0 software. Results were shown as mean ± SE. P < 0.05
was considered to be significant.
