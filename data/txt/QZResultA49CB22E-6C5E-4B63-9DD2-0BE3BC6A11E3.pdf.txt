Abstract
Of the three envelope glycoproteins encoded by hepatitis B virus (HBV) that are collectively referred to as HBV
surface antigen (HBsAg), the large HBsAg (LHBs) glycoprotein is expressed preferentially in HBV-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma. LHBs can act as an oncogene in transgenic mice, but how it contributes functionally to
hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we determined the molecular and functional roles of LHBs
during HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. LHBs increased tumor formation of hepatoma cells. Moreover,
expression of LHBs but not other HBV envelope glycoproteins speciﬁcally promoted proliferation of hepatoma
and hepatic cells in vitro. Mechanistic investigations revealed that these effects were caused by activation of the
Src/PI3K/Akt pathway through proximal stimulation of PKCa/Raf1 signaling by LHBs. Proliferation induced by
stable LHBs expression was associated with increased G1–S cell-cycle progression and apoptosis resistance
mediated by Src kinase activation, as established in hepatocellular carcinoma clinical specimens. Importantly,
LHBs-induced cellular proliferation and tumor formation were reversed by administration of the Src inhibitor
saracatinib. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that LHBs promotes tumorigenesis of hepatoma cells by triggering a
PKCa/Raf1 to Src/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, revealing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of HBVassociated hepatocarcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7547–57. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
More than 350 million people worldwide are chronically
infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is a leading cause
for chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC; refs. 1, 2). Although chronic HBV infection has been
noted to be associated with the development of HCC soon after
the discovery of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), the oncogenic
functions of HBV are not completely known, partly because of
its noncytopathic characteristic (3). Progression from chronic
hepatitis B to HCC involves direct effects of the virus protein on
the cellular function of infected hepatocytes, as well as indirect
effects through the process of inﬂammation, regeneration, and

cirrhosis because of HBV infection (4, 5). Regarding the effect of
viral proteins expression on hepatocellular malignant transformation, several HBV proteins have been found in infected
tissues more frequently than others, including large HBsAg
(LHBs), C-terminally truncated middle HBsAg (MHBs), HBV X
protein (HBx), and a novel spliced transcript of HBV, referred
to as hepatitis B–spliced protein (HBSP; ref. 6).
The viral genome of HBV encodes for 4 overlapping open
reading frames, which include preS1/preS2/S, preC/C, X, and P
(2). The preS1/preS2/S region of the virus genome encodes the
3 viral surface antigens by differential initiation of translation
at each of 3 in-frame initiation codons (7). Initiation at the
nearest start codon (S) produces the small HBsAg (SHBs),
which is the most abundant protein in hepatitis B patients.
Initiation at the more upstream start codon (preS2) generates
the MHBs, the function of which is still unknown. Initiation at
the most upstream start codon (preS1) yields the LHBs, which
is thought to play pivotal roles in binding of the virus to host
cell receptors and in the assembly of the virion and its release
from the cell (7, 8).
Previous study has shown that HBV sequences introduced
into transgenic mice are able to confer only a tissue-speciﬁc
expression of HBsAg rather than any other HBV proteins (9).
Chisari and colleagues have shown that HBV transgenic mice
that overproduce LHBs and accumulate toxic quantities of
SHBs within the hepatocytes develop severe, prolonged hepatocellular injury that initiates a programmed response with the
liver, characterized by inﬂammation, regenerative hyperplasia,
transcriptional deregulation, aneuploidy, and eventually progresses to neoplasia (10). Another study has also proved that

HBsAg-positive ground-glass hepatocytes emerged throughout the liver parenchyma in nearly all HBV transgenic mice, but
the extensive expression of HBsAg is gradually downregulated
during neoplastic transformation, just as the morphologic and
biochemical phenotypes of foci of altered hepatocytes, hepatic
adenoma, and HCC in transgenic mice, resembling those
described in chemical hepatocarcinogenesis (11). Although
the critical indirect roles of LHBs during malignant transformation in transgenic mice have been observed previously, the
direct effects of LHBs on hepatocellular function remain poorly
understood.
Extensive studies over past years have identiﬁed aberrant
activation of major signaling cascades such as PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway, Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, WNT/b-catenin
pathway, and HGF/c-MET pathway involved in pathogenesis
of HCC (12–15). Abrupt alterations that occur in liver tissues
with HBV infection cause signiﬁcant changes in several cellular
signaling including WNT/b-catenin, p53, pRb, mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-kB pathways and alter gene
expression resulting in hepatoma formation because of
increased proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis
resistance (5). As a dominant nonreceptor tyrosine kinase
activated in HCC carcinogenesis, abnormal Src signaling activation conferred by HBx expression has been reported to
participate in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis (16–18).
However, the interaction between Src signal activation with
LHBs expression during HBV infection has not been
characterized.
In this study, we sought to determine the direct oncogenic
function of LHBs expression in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Our present investigation reveals that LHBs expression promotes tumorigenesis of hepatoma cells dependent on
PKCa/Raf1/Src/PI3K/Akt signal activation in vitro and in vivo,
which may shed a new light into the molecular mechanisms
underlying HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis and provide
a promising therapeutic target for patients with HCC with
chronic HBV infection.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and human HCC samples
One immortalized hepatic cell line (L02) and 2 hepatoma cell
lines (Huh7 and SK-Hep1), in addition to an African green
monkey kidney epithelial cell line (Vero), were obtained directly from Shanghai Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
5% CO2 incubator. The cell lines have been characterized at the
bank by DNA ﬁngerprinting analysis using STR (short tandem
repeat) markers. All cell lines were placed under cryostage after
they were obtained from the bank and used within 6 months of
thawing fresh vials. Thirty-seven pairs of frozen fresh tumor
liver tissues and their peripheral nontumor tissues after surgical resection were collected from patients with HCC who had
received neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy before surgical resection in Nantong Tumor Hospital (Jiangsu) with
informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval
between 2004 and 2008.

Construction of plasmids
The plasmids containing LHBs (pcDNA3-LHBs-ﬂag), MHBs
(pcDNA3-MHBs-ﬂag), SHBs (pcDNA3-SHBs-ﬂag), Akt
(pcDNA3.1-Akt), and Raf1 (pcDNA3.1-Raf1) were generated as
previously described (19–22). The dominant-negative mutant
Raf1-S621A containing a serine-to-alanine mutation at amino
acid 621 was constructed on the basis of aforementioned Raf1
expression plasmid. The plasmid containing Src (pcDNA3.1Src) was a generous gift from Dr. Jianguo Gu (Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Miyagi, Japan). The kinase dead mutant
Src-K295M plasmid and dominant-negative mutant AktK179M plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung
(MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). All plasmid
constructs were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing.
Plasmids transfection and RNA interference
Transient and stable transfections with various plasmids
were carried out as previously described (23). Two siRNAs
against SRC gene Src siRNA (h), 2 siRNAs against AKT1/2 gene
Akt1/2 siRNA (h), 2 siRNAs against PKCa gene PKCa siRNA (h),
2 siRNAs against RAF1 gene Raf1 siRNA (h), and corresponding
control siRNA-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transfected
into Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells in 6-well plates using the
X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied
Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene
silencing effect was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis and
RT-PCR at 72 hours posttransfection.
Western blotting
Protein extraction from cultured cells or tumor tissues and
Western blot analysis were carried out as previously described
(23). Primary antibodies used included those against LHBs,
GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Akt, pAkt(S473), Src, pSrc
(Y416), Raf1, pRaf1(S338), PKCa, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4,
CDK6, cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; BD Biosciences).
Tumor xenograft experiments and saracatinib
(AZD0530) treatment
Tumor xenograft experiments in nude mice were carried out
as previously described (23). The speciﬁc Src inhibitor saracatinib (Selleck) was dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
for 5 mg/mL additive stock solution. Saracatinib gavage solution or vehicle control gavage solution was prepared freshly by
combination saracatinib additive stock solution or DMSO with
corn oil at a ratio of 95% corn oil: 5% DMSO. Subcutaneous
tumor xenografted nude mice were fed with saracatinib gavage
solution or vehicle control gavage solution daily at a dose of
25 mg/kg body weight in vehicle corn oil via oral gavage for
4 weeks as hepatoma cells subcutaneous injection.
Histology, immunohistochemical analysis, and
evaluation
Tumor sections from subcutaneous tumor xenografted
nude mice and patients with HCC were hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) stained and immunohistochemically analyzed as
described previously (24, 25). Primary antibodies used included
those against LHBs, Ki67 (Millipore), pAkt(S473), and pSrc

(Y416). The intensity of immunohistochemical staining in the
tumor cells was scored independently by 2 pathologists using
the semiquantitative IRS (immunoreactive score) scale according to Remmele and Stegner (26).
Colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay,
bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay, cell-cycle
analysis, and Annexin V/PI staining
Colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay, and cell-cycle analysis
were carried out as previously described (23). Annexin
V/propidium iodide (PI) staining was carried out by using the
Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
Experimental data were presented as mean  SD or SEM of
at least 3 independent replicates through analyzing with
GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software) and assessing comparisons between different groups by the Student t test, oneway ANOVA. The association between LHBs and clinicopathologic characteristics was assessed using the Fisher exact test.
The correlation between LHBs with Ki67, pSrc(Y416), and pAkt
(S473) staining obtained by immunohistochemistry was determined using the Spearman correlation test. Differences were
considered signiﬁcant at values of P < 0.05.

Results
LHBs expression promotes tumor formation of
hepatoma cells in vivo and in vitro
To elucidate the effect of LHBs expression on tumor
formation in vivo, tumor xenograft experiments were carried
out in nude mice with Huh7 cells stably transfected with
LHBs. As shown in Fig. 1A, stable LHBs expression in clones
1 and 2 compared with control Huh7 cells was conﬁrmed by
Western blot analysis, and Huh7-LHBs clone 2 was selected
for further investigation because of higher stable LHBs
expression. Tumor xenograft experiments showed that LHBs
expression signiﬁcantly accelerated overall tumor growth
compared with the control group as assessed by the tumor
volume (Fig. 1B). Four weeks after tumor xenograft, nude
mice were sacriﬁced and subcutaneous tumor tissues were
examined. Notably, LHBs stably expressing Huh7 cells
showed increased tumor growth compared with control
cells as determined through tumor photography and weight
measurement (Fig. 1C and D). H&E staining showed more
aggressive tumor growth gained by LHBs stably transfected
Huh7 cells than control cells in nude mice (Fig. 1E). Because
the initiating ATG codons for the MHBs and SHBs have been
mutated to ACG in the plasmid containing LHBs, aforementioned provocative tumor formation should be attributed to
LHBs expression but not MHBs or SHBs expression. To

Huh7, SK-Hep1, and L02 cells. In contrast, Vero cells undergoing identical experiments did not show increased colony
formation despite LHBs expression (data not shown). Taken
together, these data show that LHBs expression could promote tumor formation of hepatoma cells in vivo and in vitro.

LHBs expression activates PKCa/Raf1/Src/PI3K/Akt
signal pathway in hepatoma cells
To characterize the mechanistic signaling pathway underlying instigated tumor formation conferred by LHBs expression in hepatoma cells, cell proliferation assay was carried out
in LHBs expressing Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells after treatment
with small molecular inhibitors against phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K; LY294002, Wortmannin), extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK; PD98059), MAP/ERK kinase (MEK;
U0126), p38/MAPK (SB203580), NF-kB (PDTC, BAY117082),
Src (PP2), and mTOR (rapamycin). As shown in Fig. 2E and F,
no signiﬁcant change of the proliferation ratio was observed
after PD98059, U0126, SB203580, PDTC, and BAY117082 treatment compared with DMSO treatment in LHBs-Huh7 and
LHBs-SK-Hep1 cells. However, a considerable inhibition of the
proliferation ratio was noted after LY294002, Wortmannin,
rapamycin, and PP2 treatment compared with DMSO treatment in LHBs-Huh7 and LHBs-SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 2E and F).
Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that the phosphory-

www.aacrjournals.org

lation level of Src(Y416) and Akt(S473) were much higher in
LHBs-Huh7 cells with respect to the control Huh7 cells
(Fig. 3A), indicating LHBs expression could activate Src and
Akt signals in hepatoma cells. Consistent with aforementioned
phenomenon in vitro, Western blot analysis of subcutaneous
tumor tissues also showed increased pSrc(Y416) and pAkt
(S473) levels in 3 intersected tumor tissues generated by
Huh7-LHBs cells compared with control Huh7 cells from
xenografted nude mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). All these data
indicate that both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Src signaling pathways
might involve in instigated tumor formation conferred by LHBs
expression.
To further illuminate the regulatory relationship between
Src and PI3K/Akt signals activation induced by LHBs expression, Western blot analysis was carried out in Huh7 cells after
Src and PI3K/Akt signal inhibition. To assess RNA interference
knockdown effect on Src and Akt signals activation, 2 siRNAs
against Src and 2 siRNAs against Akt1/2 were prepared and
transfected into Huh7 cells to evaluate their knockdown

expression (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the aforementioned
phenomenon, both inhibition of endogenic Akt expression
with Akt siRNA transfection and prohibition endogenic Akt
kinase activity with dominant-negative mutant Akt K179M
plasmid transfection could decrease Akt(S473) phosphorylation level without effect on Src(Y416) phosphorylation level in
LHBs expressing Huh7 cells (Fig. 3E and F). These results show
that LHBs expression could induce PI3K/Akt activation via
instigating Src tyrosine kinase activity in hepatoma cells.
Because previous study has proved that PreS2 activators
including LHBs and C-terminally truncated MHBs triggered
PKCa/b-dependent activation of Raf1/Erk2 signaling, resulting in an increased hepatocyte proliferation rate in transgenic
mice (27), we hypothesized that PKC-dependent Raf1 activation might establish a mechanistic link between LHBs expression with Src kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 4A, signiﬁcant
decreased Src(Y416) and Raf1 (S338) phosphorylation levels

efﬁciency by using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Interestingly, speciﬁc Src inhibitor PP2 treatment or Src siRNA cotransfection reversed
increased phosphorylation level of Akt(S473) by LHBs
transfection in Huh7 cells, suggesting LHBs might promote
PI3K/Akt activation through Src signal pathway (Fig. 3A and
C). To clarify the functional role of Src tyrosine kinase activation in LHBs-induced Akt activation, kinase dead mutant Src
K295M plasmid cotransfection was used to competing endogenous Src tyrosine kinase activity. Inhibition of Src tyrosine
kinase activation mediated by Src K295M plasmid transfection
could dramatically reverse upregulated phosphorylation level
of Akt(S473) by LHBs expression in Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B).
However, blockade PI3K activity with its speciﬁc inhibitor
LY294002, which could signiﬁcantly downregulate the
increased Akt(S473) phosphorylation level, had no effect on
enhanced Src(Y416) phosphorylation level induced by LHBs

in LHBs-expressing Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells, suggesting
PKCa/Raf1 signal activity is required for LHBs-induced Src

LHBs-Huh7 cells was also reversed by Src kinase inhibition
with Src K295M cotransfection (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Table
S1). Western blot analysis for G1–S cell-cycle regulators such as
cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6 showed that despite no
alteration with cyclin D3 and CDK6 protein levels after LHBs
expression, increased cyclin D1 and CDK4 protein levels was
reversed by cotransfection with Src K295M in LHBs-Huh7 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover, Annexin V/PI staining
assay (Fig. 5F; Supplementary Fig. S3D) and Western blot
analysis for cleaved caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S3E) in
LHBs-Huh7 cells under serum starvation indicated that apoptosis resistance conferred by LHBs expression was reversed
by Src kinase inhibition with Src K295M cotransfection. Taken
together, these results indicate that LHBs expression could
promote cellular proliferation, G1–S cell-cycle progression, and
apoptosis resistance in hepatoma cells.

cellular proliferative rate, and tumor formation were assessed
in LHBs stably expressing Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells after a
speciﬁc Src inhibitor saracatinib treatment, which was used to
suppress Src kinase activity. Results of cell proliferation assay
showed that saracatinib treatment could signiﬁcantly attenuate promotive hepatoma cellular proliferation conferred by
stable LHBs expression in Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 6A and
B). More importantly, tumor xenograft experiments in nude
mice showed that orally saracatinib administration could also
alleviate instigative tumor formation induced by stable LHBs
expression in Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 6C–F). These
results show saracatinib administration could suppress cellular proliferation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo through
intervening Src signal activation conferred by LHBs expression,
which might be used as a potential therapeutic target for HBVassociated patients with HCC.

formation conferred by LHBs expression

therapeutic target in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis,

LHBs expression positively correlates with increased

during HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo, immunohistochemistry was carried out to analyze the staining
patterns of proliferative marker Ki67, pSrc(Y416), and pAkt
and Src in tumor tissues from 37 patients with HCC. On the
basis of the immunohistochemical results of LHBs staining, all
37 patients with HCC were divided into 2 groups: LHBs
negative group (n ¼ 18) and LHBs positive group (n ¼ 19).
LHBs expression in immunohistochemistry correlated positively with the tumor grade (P ¼ 0.004) but did not show
association with any other clinicopathologic parameters (Supplementary Table S2). Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that LHBs expression was positively correlated with Ki67 (n ¼
37, r ¼ 0.502, P ¼ 0.001), pSrc(Y416) (n ¼ 37, r ¼ 0.373, P ¼
0.023), and pAkt(S473) (n ¼ 37, r ¼ 0.444, P ¼ 0.005) staining in
HCC tumor tissues (Fig. 7A–D; Supplementary Table S3). These
results suggest that Src/Akt signal activation and increased
cellular proliferation positively correlate with LHBs expression
during the development of HBV-associated HCC.

Discussion
Although chronic HBV infection has been linked epidemiologically to the development of HCC for more than 30 years,
the molecular mechanisms underlying viral-induced hepatocarcinogenesis remain largely controversial (3, 28). While
signiﬁcant advances have been noted in understanding of
indirect roles of chronic HBV infection proposed on the
molecular basis of HBV-associated HCC, including virus persistence, genetic alterations conferred by HBV DNA integration, and hepatic cell clone expansion because of chronic
inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis, increasing studies indicate that
expression of HBV proteins such as HBx, PreS2 activators, and
HBSP could modulate hepatic malignant transformation
(5, 6, 29–32). In the absence of a dominant oncogene encoded
by HBV genome, molecular pathways engaged in growth signal

transduction being hijacking by viral proteins for malignant
transformation in hepatic cells served as underlying mechanisms for HBV-associated tumorigenesis (5). Among all putative
oncopromotive proteins encoded by HBV genome, LHBs
addressed our attentions because of its potential of activating
transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) and
NF-kB to trigger cellular proliferation, both of which could play
essential roles during inﬂammation-related tumorigenesis
(27, 33, 34). Our current study shows the provocative effect of
LHBs on tumor formation of hepatoma cells in vivo and in vitro,
which provides further evidence on the oncogenic function of
LHBs during HBV-related HCC development.
Because 2 signal transduction cascades including insulin/
IGF/IRS-1/MAPK and WNT/Frizzled/b-catenin pathways are
activated early in over 90% of HCC tumors (35), we ﬁrst
investigated the contribution of these 2 pathways to tumor
formation instigation conferred by LHBs expression. MAPK/
MEK/ERK signal inhibition with speciﬁc inhibitors PD98059,
U0126, and SB203580 could not alleviate increased hepatoma
cellular proliferation induced by LHBs expression, and LHBs
expression could not alter protein expression or nuclear localization of b-catenin (data not shown), which excluded the
possibilities of these 2 pathways involved in this phenomenon.
Perturbation of hepatic NF-kB signal activity provides a mechanistic link between inﬂammation and cancer in hepatic
inﬂammation–ﬁbrosis–cancer axis, and NF-kB is a major
factor controlling both proneoplastic and malignant cells to
resist apoptosis-based tumor surveillance mechanisms (36,
37). But NF-kB activity inhibition with speciﬁc inhibitors PDTC
and BAY117082 in our experiments could not attenuate provocative hepatoma cellular proliferation conferred by LHBs
expression, which excluded the dedication of NF-kB activity on
this phenomenon and conﬂicted with previous ﬁnding that
LHBs could activate NF-kB to trigger cellular proliferation (27).
However, our current investigation could not exclude the

potential NF-kB activation conferred by LHBs expression, and
the mechanistic link between NF-kB activity and hepatic
cellular proliferation remains largely debated and awaits further investigation (38).
Genetic approaches and microarray technologies for analyzing gene expression proﬁles have revealed strikingly distinctive molecular mechanisms operate in HBV-related HCC,
which includes a high copy number of HBV, mutations in
PIK3CA and TP53, and speciﬁc activation of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway (5, 39). Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway could be overactivated by enhanced stimulation of
receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly the IGF receptor and
EGFR (40). Expression of both IGF and IGF receptor is upregulated in HCC and human cirrhotic liver, resulting in stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (5). Evidence
also suggested that anomalies in PTEN function may lead to
overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in HCC (41).
Interestingly, our present study conﬁrmed that elevated hepatoma cellular proliferation ratio because of LHBs expression
was dependent on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal activation by using
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway speciﬁc inhibitors LY294002, Wortmannin, and rapamycin treatment, which further showed the
fundamental effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation on
HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, mounting evidences indicated the substantial role of Src signaling in the
process of HCC development. Previous studies reported that
increased Src tyrosine kinase activity was observed in HCC
specimens on the basis of in vitro Src kinase assays, in comparison with liver tissue from normal subjects and chronic
hepatitis (16, 17). In another report, stimulation of hepatocytes
with stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1) led to the activation
of the Src kinases, which in turn stimulates the Akt signal (42).
Our results presented here also indicated the crucial role of Src
tyrosine kinase activation in promotive hepatoma cellular
proliferation conferred by LHBs expression by using speciﬁc
Src inhibitor PP2 treatment. More importantly, we also showed
that LHBs-induced Akt signal activation was dependent on Src
tyrosine kinase activity by using speciﬁc inhibitor treatment,
kinase dead mutant cotransfection, and speciﬁc siRNA
cotransfection. Consistent with previous study indicating
PreS2 activators triggered PKCa/b-dependent Raf1 activation
(27), our present investigation further revealed a mechanistic
link between Src/Akt signal activation and LHBs expression
through PKCa/Raf1 pathway, which could be potential molecular basis for HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.
In addition to cellular proliferative promotion, our current
study found that LHBs expression could also accelerate G1–S
cell-cycle progression and endue with apoptosis resistance
through Src activation in hepatoma cells, all of which constitute the oncogenic function of LHBs expression in

HBV-associated tumorigenesis. Moreover, correlative analysis
among Src/Akt signal activation, cellular proliferative status,
and LHBs expression in our investigation here also revealed
that LHBs expression was positively correlated with Src/Akt
activation and cellular proliferation in HCC tumor tissues. Our
present demonstrations of the increased pSrc(Y416) staining in
HCC tissues and the potent inhibitory effect of Src kinase dead
mutant on oncogenic functions conferred by LHBs expression
in hepatoma cells in vitro provide a strong rationale that
speciﬁc Src inhibitor might be developed as an anticancer
agent in patients with HCC with chronic HBV infection. Our
current study also elucidates the potential therapeutic effect of
an oral Src speciﬁc inhibitor saracatinib on hepatoma cell
xenografted tumor in nude mice, which merits further clinical
investigation on patients with HBV-associated HCC to assess
its feasible therapeutic efﬁciency.
On the basis of our current results, we propose a schematic
model illustrating a possible molecular mechanism and functional basis for HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis conferred
by LHBs expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). In conclusion, our
results presented here reveal a novel association between LHBs
expression and PKCa/Raf1/Src/PI3K/Akt signal activation in
the development of HBV-associated HCC, thus revealing a
putative molecular mechanism for the development and progression of HBV-associated HCC. These results shed a new light
for potential therapeutic intervention to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis in the high-risk group of chronic hepatitis B patients
with PKCa/Raf1/Src/PI3K/Akt signal suppression treatment.
