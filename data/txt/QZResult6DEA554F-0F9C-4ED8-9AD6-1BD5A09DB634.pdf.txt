ABSTRACT
RASSF10 has previously been reported to be frequently methylated in a number
of malignancies. To understand the importance of RASSF10 inactivation in colorectal
carcinogenesis, eight colorectal cancer cell lines, 89 cases of primary colorectal
cancer and 5 cases of normal colorectal mucosa were examined. Methylation specific
PCR, western blot, siRNA, gene expression array and xenograft mice were employed.
The expression of RASSF10 was regulated by promoter regional methylation
in colorectal cancer cells. RASSF10 was methylated in 60.7% (54/89) of primary
colorectal cancers and was positively associated with tumor stage (p < 0.05) and
metastasis (p < 0.05). Restoration of RASSF10 led to inhibition of colorectal cancer
cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and increased apoptosis. Gene expression arrays
discovered RASSF10 inhibition of MDM2 expression as a mediator of these effects,
which was confirmed with RT- PCR and western blot. RASSF10 was shown to activate
P53 signaling in RKO and HCT116 cells after UV exposure, and sensitized these cells to
docetaxel. In conclusion, our study demonstrates RASSF10 is frequently methylated in
human colorectal cancer leading to loss of expression. RASSF10 normally suppresses
human colorectal cancer growth by activating P53 signaling in colorectal cancer, and
restored expression sensitizes colorectal cancer to docetaxel.

are of interest-since they are potentially reversible with
epigenetic therapy [6–8].
RASSF proteins were originally designated on the
basis of sequence homology to domains that associated
with Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins. These domains
are known as Ras association (RA) domains and are
distinct from Ras-binding domains (RBD) which bind
an alternative set of Ras effectors. There are currently
10 members within the RASSF family (RASSF1–10)
subdivided into two subgroups, the classical RASSF
proteins (RASSF1–6) and the N-terminal RASSF proteins

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
malignancies and the fourth most common cause of cancer
related death in the world. About 1.2 million new cases
were diagnosed and over 600 000 patients were died each
year [1]. The pathogenesis of colorectal cancer remains
unclear. Accumulation of gene mutation and epigenetic
changes are regarded as important factors for the
development of this malignancy [2–5]. Epigenetic changes
can complement mutations to alter signaling pathways and

(RASSF7–10) based on the location of the RA domain [9,
10]. In addition to a RA domain, classical RASSF proteins
also have a protein-protein interaction motif known as the
SARAH (SARAH: SAlvador, RAssf, Hippo) domain that
is responsible for scaffolding and regulatory interactions.
The N-terminal RASSFs lack an identifiable SARAH
domain, although the SMART database predicts that
RASSF7, 8 and 10 contain extensive coiled-coil regions,
which can be dimerized [11, 12]. RASSF10 gene is located
on chromosome 11p15.2 and contains an over 2 kb CpG
island in the promoter region [13]. RASSF10 is frequently
methylated in different cancers [14–20]. Knockdown of
RASSF10 increases mitosis in A549 lung cancer cells
[11]. However, the epigenetic change and the function of
RASSF10 in colorectal cancer remains unclear.

converts Met to Leu. However, none of these mutations
explain the loss of RASSF10 expression and mutation of
RASSF10 appears to be a rare event in human colorectal
cancer. The results suggest that RASSF10 expression
is mainly altered by promoter region methylation in
colorectal cancer.

RASSF10 was frequently methylated in human
primary colorectal cancer
To determine whether methylation of RASSF10
occurred in primary colorectal cancer, 89 cases of
colorectal cancer samples with paired normal tissue and
5 cases of normal colorectal mucosa were examined
by MSP. 60.7% (54/89) of colorectal cancer and 26.9%
(24/89) of adjacent tissue samples were methylated,
while no methylation was found in normal colorectal
mucosa (Fig. 1C). The methylation of RASSF10 was
associated with lymph node metastases (P < 0.05) and
late tumor stage (P < 0.05), but no association was found
with age, gender, anatomic location and differentiation
(Table 1). RASSF10 expression was next evaluated using
immunohistochemistry in 27 available colorectal cancer
and matched adjacent tissue samples. Without reduction
of RASSF10 expression and unmethylation were found
in 7 cases of cancer tissue samples. Reduced expression
was found in 20 cases of colorectal cancer and 3 cases
of adjacent tissue samples. The expression of RASSF10
was reduced significantly in colorectal cancer compared
with adjacent tissue samples (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). In the
20 cases of cancer samples, which RASSF10 expression
was reduced, 13 cases were methylated. Reduced
expression was associated with RASSF10 promoter region
hypermethylation significantly (p < 0.05). (Fig. 1D).

RESULTS
RASSF10 expression was regulated by
promoter region hypermethylation in colorectal
cancer cells
To determine the level of expression of RASSF10,
semi-quantitative RT-PCR was employed in colorectal
cancer cells (LOVO, RKO, DLD1, HT29, HCT116,
SW480, SW620, LS180). Expression of RASSF10 was
found in cell line LS180, loss of RASSF10 expression
was found in LOVO, RKO and HCT116 cells, and
reduced expression was found in DLD1, HT29, SW480
and SW620 cells (Fig. 1A). As a test of whether RASSF10
expression was potentially affected by promoter region
hypermethylation, these colorectal cancer cell lines
were treated by 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza), a DNA
methylation transferase inhibitor. Re-expression of
RASSF10 was found in LOVO, RKO and HCT116 cells,
and increased expression was found in LS180, DLD1,
HT29, SW480 and SW620 cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting
that DNA methylation may have led to transcriptional
repression. Using methylation specific PCR (MSP) to
examine the promoter region of RASSF10, complete
methylation was found in LOVO, RKO and HCT116
cells, and partial methylation was found in LS180,
DLD1, HT29, SW480 and SW620 cells (Fig. 1B). Thus,
promoter region methylation correlated with loss/reduced
RASSF10 expression. To further validate the efficiency of
MSP primers and the methylation density in the promoter
region, sodium bisulfite sequencing was performed in
RKO and HT29 cell lines. The results demonstrate that
MSP result is correlated with bisulfite sequencing results
very well (Fig. 1B). Genomic sequencing was next
performed to exclude the possibility of RASSF10 mutation
causing loss or reduction of expression. One mutation was
found in HCT116 cells at 591 locus (G to A) converts Arg
to His. 2 different mutations were found in 2 of 89 cases
primary colorectal cancer. One is at 806 +locus (G to C)
converts Glu to Gln. Another is at 1550 locus (A to C)

Restoration of RASSF10 expression inhibits cell
proliferation, induces apoptosis and G2/M phase
arrest in CRC cells
The effect of RASSF10 on cell proliferation was
analyzed by colony formation, MTT and flow cytometry
in RKO and HCT116 cells. There was a 55–65% reduction
in colony formation, with the number of colonies being
329 ± 13 vs 149 ± 8 (P < 0.05) and 485 ± 44 vs 171 ±
41 (P < 0.05) before and after restoration of RASSF10
expression in RKO and HCT116 cells respectively
(Fig. 2A). Cell viability was determined using MTT, with
a 35% reduction, with OD values of 0.703 ± 0.047 vs
0.462 ± 0.039 (P < 0.05) in RKO cells and 1.031 ± 0.081
vs 0.680 ± 0.061 (P < 0.05) in HCT116 cells before and
after restoration of RASSF10 expression (Fig. 2B). These
results suggest that RASSF10 inhibits cell proliferation in
colorectal cancer cells.
Next, we measured apoptotic cells after restoration
of RASSF10 expression in RKO 4.84 ± 0.26% vs baseline
of 1.07 ± 0.13% (P < 0.05), and HCT116 cells 7.55 ±

0.13% vs baseline of 1.22 ± 0.12% (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). To
confirm the effect of RASSF10 on apoptosis in colorectal
cancer cells, cleaved PARP and survivin, a representative
apoptotic marker and anti-apoptotic marker, were
examined by western blot before and after restoration of
RASSF10. Expression of cleaved PARP was increased and
expression of survivin was reduced after re-expression of
RASSF10 in RKO and HCT116 cells (Fig. 2D), confirming
the annexin staining of increased apoptosis in CRC cells.
To further examine growth inhibition, we
determined cell cycle distribution before and after
restoration of RASSF10 expression in RKO cells with the
following findings: 51.8 ± 2.3% vs 42.4 ± 0.7% (P < 0.05)
in G0/1 phase, 37.9 ± 1.6% vs 38.1 ± 0.5% in S phase and
10.4 ± 1.8% vs 19.5 ± 1.2% (P < 0.05) in G2/M phase.
The cell phase distribution before and after restoration of
RASSF10 expression in HCT116 cells was as follows:
43.0 ± 5.7% vs 35.7 ± 4.4% (P < 0.05) in G0/1 phase, 44.2

± 5.7% vs 41.6 ± 1.8% in S phase and 12.8 ± 0.1% vs 22.7
± 2.7% (P < 0.05) in G2/M phase. This suggested that
G0/1 phase was reduced and G2/M phase was increased
in RKO and HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting G2/M
checkpoint inhibition. To further validate the effect of
RASSF10 on G2/M check point, the expression of cdc2 and cyclin B1, important G2/M check point regulators,
was determined using western blot. The expression of
cdc-2 and cyclin B1 was reduced after re-expression of
RASSF10 in RKO and HCT116 cells (Fig. 3B), providing
a mechanism by which RASSF10 induces G2/M arrest in
colorectal cancer.

found restoration of RASSF10 induces G2/M arrest in
colorectal cancer. We explored the sensitivity of RKO and
HCT116 cells to docetaxel before and after re-expression
of RASSF10. The IC50 of docetaxel was 4.508 ± 0.175 vs
2.688 ± 0.103 μg/ml (P < 0.05) in RKO cells and 5.366

david.niaid.nih.gov) (Fig. 4B). Of greatest interest was
MDM2, which is known to play an important role in
the tumorigenesis as a key component of P53 signaling
which directly promotes P53 degradation by catalyzing
the ubiquitination of P53. Down regulation of MDM2
following restoration of RASSF10 expression was
confirmed using RT-PCR (Fig. 4C) and further confirmed
using western blot (Fig. 4D).

RASSF10 activates P53 signaling in colorectal
cancer

Isolation and identification of cancer related
genes regulated by RASSF10 in colorectal cancer

To determine the role of RASSF10 in P53 signaling,
the expression of P53, bcl-2, bax and cleaved caspase-3
were examined using western blot in RASSF10 expressed
and baseline RKO and HCT116 cells. The expression of
P53, bax and cleaved caspase-3 all increased and bcl-2
was reduced following restoration of RASSF10 expression
in RKO and HCT116 cells (Fig. 4D).
To further study the function of RASSF10 in P53
signaling, DNA damage was induced by exposing RKO
and HCT116 cells to UV. The expression of P53, bax and
cleaved caspase-3 was increased, and MDM2 and bcl-2

To understand the mechanism by which RASSF10
functions to alter proliferation and apoptosis in colorectal
cancer, gene expression microarray was utilized. The
expression of 3575 genes were increased or reduced
by more than two fold in RASSF10 re-expressed RKO
cells. Among these genes, 46 were up regulated more
than 10 fold and 35 were down regulated more than
10 fold (Fig. 4A). Further analysis found among these
genes, only MDM2 and GSTO2 belong to cancer related

were reduced only after re-expression of RASSF10 in
UV exposed RKO and HCT116 (Fig. 5A). This further
indicates that P53 signaling was activated by RASSF10 in
colorectal cancer.
To confirm this effect of RASSF10 in P53 signaling,
siRNA knockdown technique was employed in LS180
cells which basally express the highest level of RASSF10
among colorectal cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5B,
UV exposure increases the expression of P53, bax and
cleaved caspase-3 in the parental cells which is diminished
with knockdown of RASSF10. These results further
suggest that RASSF10 is a modulator of P53 signaling
pathway in human colorectal cancer.

20 cases with reduced RASSF10 expression, 17 cases
had MDM2 high level expression while 3 cases had low
level expression. The expression of MDM2 is inversely
correlated with RASSF10 in primary colorectal cancer
(Fig. 5C, P < 0.05).

RASSF10 suppresses HCT116 cell xenograft
growth in mice
To further study the function of RASSF10 in
colorectal cancer, RASSF10 expressed and unexpressed
HCT116 cell xenograft mice models were employed (Fig.
6A). Tumor growth was marked diminished with RASSF10
expression, with the mean tumor volumes measured at
28 days being 721.25 ± 55.7 mm3 vs 158.17 ± 49 mm3
(P < 0.05, Fig. 6B), and the weight was 360 ± 25 mg vs
76.67 ± 27.5 mg (P < 0.05) in RASSF10 unexpressed and
expressed HCT116 cell xenografts respectively (Fig. 6C).
The expression of RASSF10, MDM2 and P53 in xenografts
was examined by IHC. The expression of MDM2 was
reduced and the expression of P53 increased in RASSF10
re-expressed HCT116 cell xenografts compared to parental
controls not expressing RASSF10 (Fig. 6D).

RASSF10 expression in reversely in human

DISCUSSION

important role in tumorigenesis and interacts with several
members of the RASSF family directly or indirectly. For
example, RASSF1A, RASSF3, RASSF5A and RASSF6
have been shown to interact with MDM2 and facilitate its
degradation, resulting in the stabilization of P53 [21–24].
RASSF3 interacts with MDM2 via SARAH domain [22],
while RASSF1A promotes MDM2 self-ubiquetination by
disrupting the MDM2-DAXX-HAUSP complex, resulting
in the stabilization and activation of p53 [22]. Similarities
of RASSF10 to other RASSF proteins suggest that it
could also activate P53 signaling by promoting MDM2
degradation. P53 plays a pivotal role in regulation of
cellular processes including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Activating p53 signaling may either induce cell cycle arrest
or inhibit cell growth and promote cell apoptosis [25–29].
Indeed, our study indicates that the expression of MDM2
was suppressed by restoring expression of RASSF10, and
P53 signaling was activated in colorectal cancer cells. These
results suggest that RASSF10 suppresses colorectal cancer
cell growth by activating P53 signaling.
Previous studies in A549 lung cancer cells reported
that knockdown of RASSF10 increases mitosis [11].
In this study we demonstrate that restoring RASSF10

RASSF10 has been reported to be frequently
methylated in different malignancies and has been
regarded as tumor suppressor [14–20]. In this study,
RASSF10 was found to be frequently methylated in
human colorectal cancer with resulting loss of expression.
The presence of methylation of RASSF10 was associated
with adverse features including lymph node metastases
(P < 0.05) and increased tumor stage (P < 0.05). Since
we have demonstrated tumor suppressor functions
for RASSF10, reversal of RASSF10 repression may
potentially be an approach for colorectal cancer therapy.
RASSF10 methylation may also serve as a marker of poor
prognosis of colorectal cancer.
Our study provides a molecular mechanism by which
RASSF10 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Through the use
of gene expression arrays, we identified genes regulated by
RASSF10 directly or indirectly. This demonstrated down
regulation of MDM2 by RASSF10 as a mechanism to
activate p53. MDM2 is a key component of P53 signaling
and directly promotes P53 degradation by catalyzing the
ubiquitination of P53. MDM2 has been reported to play an

expression induced both G2/M arrest and apoptosis in
colorectal cancer cells. Since docetaxel is a microtubule
inhibitor which is most effective in mitotic phase,
we found that sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to
docetaxel was indeed increased in RKO and HCT116
when RASSF10 expression was restored.
In conclusion, RASSF10 was frequently
methylated in human colorectal cancer and methylation
of RASSF10 was associated with late tumor stage and
metastases. The expression of RASSF10 was regulated
by promoter region hypermethylation. RASSF10
suppressed human colorectal cancer by activating P53
signaling both in vitro and in vivo. RASSF10 is a mitosis
inhibitor whcih sensitized colorectal cancer cells to
docetaxel.

in xenografts. (images, 200×).

DNA extraction, methylation-specific PCR
(MSP) and bisulfite sequencing (BSSQ)
Genomic DNA of CRC cells and tissue samples
were extracted by proteinase K method. MSP and BSSQ
were performed as described previously [31, 32]. Primers
for MSP and BSSQ were designed around transcription
start site. The sequences of MSP primers as follow:
5′-GTGTTATGGATTTTTTGGAAAAGAAGATATT-3′
[33], 5′-TCCTCCAAAAACACTCACACAACATCA-3′
(UR), 5′-GTTATGGATTTTTCGGAAAAGAAGATATC
-3′ (MF) and 5′-CTCCAAAAACACTCGCACAACGT
CG-3′ (MR). Primers sequences of BSSQ are as follow:
5′-GAGTTATTGGGTTGTTTTTGTTG-3′ (F) and
5′-CRACAACCRTCCTCCAAAAAC-3′ (R).

paraffin blocks. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against
RASSF10 (Abgent, San Diego, U.S.), MDM2 ( Abgent,
San Diego, U.S.) and rabbit monoclonal antibody against
P53 (Bioworld Tech, MN, USA) were employed. IHC
was performed and evaluated as described previously
[32]. The staining intensity and extent of the staining area
were graded according to the German semi-quantitative
scoring system as described before [34, 35]. Staining
intensity of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and/or membrane
was characterized as follows: no staining = 0; weak
staining = 1; moderate staining = 2; strong staining = 3;
the extent of staining was defined as: 0% = 0, 1–24% = 1,
25–49% = 2, 50–74% = 3, 75–100% = 4. The final immunereactive score (0 to 12) was determined by multiplying
intensity score with the extent of staining score.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Plasmid construction and transfection

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on
4 μm thick serial sections derived from formaldehyde-fixed

The RASSF10CDs region was amplified by RT-PCR.
The primers are as follows: 5′-GATCGAATTCGCCA

and 5′-GATCTC TAGACTACACAAGGGATTCG
CACATG-3′ (R). The products were subcloned into
the lentiviral vector pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Clontech
Laboratories, Inc, Takara U.S.). Then, the lentiviral
RASSF10 plasmid was co-transfected into HEK 293T
cells along with pVSVG and pΔ8.91 using PEI (cat: 23966
polysciences USA). Cells were infected with recombinant
lentivirus-transducing units.

RNA from RASSF10 expressed and unexpressed
RKO cells were purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN China (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.) and then analyzed
by gene expression array (Agilent Human (4 × 44k)).

SiRNA knockdown assay was performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences
of siRNA targeting RASSF10 and RNAi Negative
Control Duplex are as follow: siRNA duplex (sense:
5′-GCGAAGAGCAAGAGAAUGUTT-3′;
antisense:
5′-ACAUUCUCUUGCUCUUCGCTT-3′); RNAi negative
control duplex (sense: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGU
CACGUTT-3′; antisense: 5′-ACGUGACACGUUC
GGAGAATT-3′) (Gene Pharma Co, Shanghai, China).

Western blot was performed as described
previously [30]. Antibodies were diluted according to
manufacturer’s instruction. Primary antibodies are as
follow: RASSF10 (Abgent, San Diego, U.S.), MDM2
(Abgent, San Diego, U.S.), P53 (Bioworld Tech,
MN, USA), cleaved PARP (Cell Signalinging
Technology, USA), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signalinging
Technology, USA), bax(Beyotime Biotech, China),
bcl-2 (Cell Signalinging Technology, USA), cyclinB1
(Bioworld Tech, MN, USA), cdc-2 (Bioworld Tech, MN,
USA), survivin (Bioworld Tech, MN, USA) and β-actin
(Beyotime Biotech, China).

Colony formation assay

The effect of RASSF10 on HCT116 cell xenograft

Cells were plated into 3.5 cm dishes and cultured
for 2 weeks. Then cells were fixed with 75% ethanol for
30 minutes, stained with 0.2% crystal violet (Beyotime,
Nanjing, China) for 20 minutes and counted.

RASSF10 expressed and unexpressed HCT116 cells
(3 × 106 cells in 0.1 ml phosphate-buffered saline) was
subcutaneously injected into the dorsal flank of 5-weekold female BABL/c nude mice (n = 6 each group). The
tumor size was measured 3 days after inoculation for 4
weeks by every 5 days. The tumor volume was determined
with the following formula: tumor volume (mm3) = (length
(mm)) × (width (mm))2 / 2. All procedures were approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Chinese PLA
General Hospital.

SiRNA knockdown assay

Cell viability assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plate at a density
of 3 × 103 cells/well, and cell viability was measured
at 24, 48 and 72 h using the MTT assay kit (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA) according to the company’s
instruction. Absorbance was measured on a microplate
reader (Thermo Multiskan MK3 USA) at a wavelength
of 490 nm.
For chemo-sensitivity assay, cells were seeded
in 96-well plates and treated with docetaxel at the dose
of 0, 0.2, 2, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/ml. Absorbance was
measured as above. The percentage of viable cells
(%) = (A490(treated) - A490(blank))/(A490(control) A490(blank)) × 100%. IC50 was defined as the
concentration, which was required for 50% inhibition of
cell growth.

Statistical analysis
SPSS 17.0 software was employed. Quantitative
data were presented as the mean ± SEM. A p value of less
than 0.05 was considered statistical significance.
