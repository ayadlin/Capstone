Reduced Reactive Oxygen Species–Generating Capacity
Contributes to the Enhanced Cell Growth of ArsenicTransformed Epithelial Cells
Qingshan Chang1, Jingju Pan1, Xing Wang1, Zhuo Zhang1, Fei Chen2, and Xianglin Shi1

Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the activation of protein kinases, DNA damage responses, and cell apoptosis. The details of how ROS regulate these intracellular biochemical and genetic processes remain to be fully understood. By establishing transformed bronchial epithelial cells through chronic
low-dose arsenic treatment, we showed that the capacity of ROS generation induced by arsenic is substantially
reduced in the transformed cells relative to the nontransformed cells. Such a reduction in ROS generation
endows cells with premalignant features, including rapid growth, resistance to arsenic toxicity, and increased
colony formation of the transformed cells. To validate these observations, the capability of ROS generation was
restored in the transformed cells by treatment with inhibitors or siRNAs to silence the function of superoxide
dismutase (SOD) or catalase and cell growth was determined following these treatments. Enhancement in ROS
generation suppressed cell growth and colony formation of the transformed cells significantly. Despite the fact
that the transformed cells showed a decreased expression of NF-κB signaling proteins IKKβ and IKKγ, the
proteolytic processing p105 and p100 and NF-κB DNA binding activity were elevated in these cells. Increasing
ROS generation by silencing SOD and catalase reduced the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in the transformed
cells. Taken together, the transformed cells induced by arsenic exhibited a decrease in ROS generation, which
is responsible for the enhanced cell growth and colony formation of the transformed cells, most likely through
a sustained alternative activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. Cancer Res; 70(12); 5127–35. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Environmental or occupational exposure to arsenic has
been a worldwide health problem for several decades (1).
In certain geographic locations, abundant arsenic can be
found in the Earth's crust, rock, soil, water, and air (2). Occupational arsenic exposure mainly occurred in the industries
of mining, manufacturing, wood preservation, and agriculture (3). Emerging evidence clearly indicates that chronic exposure to arsenic or arsenic-containing compounds causes
cancers of skin, bladder, liver, and kidney (4). The toxicity
or carcinogenicity of arsenic varies depending on the oxidation state and chemical form of arsenic or arsenic compound. It is believed that the inorganic form of arsenic,
especially inorganic trivalent arsenic (As3+), is more carcinogenic and reactive with thiol-containing molecules. The primary routes of human exposure to arsenic are inhalation,

ingestion, and dermal contact. Despite extensive efforts in
determining how As3+ causes malignant transformation of
the normal cells in a number of experimental systems, the
carcinogenic mechanism of As3+ remains poorly understood.
Several important intracellular signaling pathways can be activated or regulated by As3+ exposure, such as NF-κB (5),
AP-1 (6), p53 (7), Notch (8), GADD45a (9), Akt (10), PKC
(11), and PML (12), which can contribute to cell growth, transformation, oncogene expression, cell apoptosis, and vasculation.
The effect of arsenic is largely achieved through both
direct binding of arsenic to proteins and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the oxidation-reduction
reaction of the trivalent arsenic and pentavalent arsenic
compounds. Due to its similarities in atom structure and
chemical characteristics with phosphorus, As5+ is able to
substitute for phosphate and interfere with the posttranslational modification and function of intracellular proteins.
On the other hand, As3+ is capable of binding to the thiol
group of the proteins important for cellular metabolism and
signaling. The most important role of As 3+ in cellular
biochemical and biological responses is its ability in ROS
induction. Evidence supporting this notion is from studies
showing induction of ROS in cells derived from either normal tissues or tumors (13). Although mitochondria have
been implicated as a potential source of ROS in response
to As 3+ (14), accumulating data suggest that NADPH
oxidase may be the primary source for the generation of

superoxide anion (O2•−; refs. 15, 16). As3+ not only induces
expression of the NADPH oxidase components including
p47, p67, p91, and several scaffolding protein for the assembly of this complex (15) but also stimulates the enzyme
activity of the NADPH oxidase by inducing phosphorylation
and translocation of p47 (17). It has been generally viewed
that ROS are the key mediators for As3+-induced carcinogenesis through oxidative stress and genetic mutation.
Paradoxically, generation of ROS is also the one of the central mechanisms to the desired tumor cell apoptosis induced
by As3+ and some chemotherapeutic reagents. In the present
study, we provide evidence suggesting that the capacity of
ROS generation is severely compromised in the As3+-induced
transformed cells. Reduction in ROS generation endows the
transformed cells resistance to As3+ cytotoxicity, rapid proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and a sustained
activation of the NF-κB transcription factor.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture
Arsenic trichloride (AsCl3) was purchased from Sigma. All
antibodies used in Western blotting were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The human bronchial epithelial
cell line BEAS-2B was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1%
L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.
Colony formation assay
To measure anchorage-independent growth in soft agar,
5 × 103 cells were suspended in 0.3% agar in DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine,
and 10% FBS and overlaid on 0.5% agar in the same medium
in six-well plates. After 4 weeks, colonies were stained with
0.005% crystal violet, counted microscopically, and photographed with a dissection microscope.

with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease
and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Total protein
(40 μg) was separated on 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose-enhanced chemiluminescence membranes (GE Healthcare). The blots were probed with various
antibodies as indicated in the figures.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and
immunofluorescence staining
Nuclear protein was extracted using NE-PER nuclear and
cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). In brief, the
NF-κB consensus binding sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was end labeled with biotin as probes,
and the binding reaction was performed in a final volume of
20 μL with 2 μg of nuclear extract and 2 fmol of labeled
probes. For competition assay, 200× unlabeled NF-κB consensus binding oligonucleotide was added in binding reaction. For supershift assays, 2 μL of antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were incubated at room temperature with
nuclear extracts for 30 minutes before binding reaction.
Then, the mixture was incubated for additional 20 minutes
at room temperature, and the reactions were separated on
6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The activation status
of NF-κB was also evaluated by immunofluorescence staining
of the cells with antibodies against NF-κB p50 or p65 followed by analyzing the images captured by fluorescence
microscopy.

Measurement of intracellular ROS
Cells were washed once with warm PBS and incubated
with 10 μmol/L 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate ethyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) or 5 μmol/L dihydroethidium (DHE; Molecular
Probes), respectively, in warm PBS for 30 minutes. Then, cells
were washed with warm PBS and incubated in media for
30 minutes. After incubation, cells were trypsinized, washed
twice with cold PBS, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). In some experiments, the DHE- or CM-H2DCFDA–stained cells were also
subjected to immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (18).

Gene silencing and transfection
To knock down the specific genes of interest, artificial miRNA
sequences were designed using BLOCT-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and
inserted into the pcDNA6.2-GW/miR vector (BLOCK-iT Pol II
miR RNAi Expression Vector, Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The recombinant vector
and the control plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/miR-neg were transfected into the As3+-transformed cells using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Stably transfected cell lines with
specific gene silencing of SOD2, catalase, or NF-κB subunit p50
were selected in the medium containing 10 μg/mL blasticidine.
The artificial miRNA sequences inserted into the BLOCK-iT Pol
II miR RNAi Expression Vector are as follows: SOD2,
5′-TGCTGAAAGGAACCAAAGTCACGTTTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACAAACGTGATTGGTTCCTTT-3 ′; c atalase,

5′-TGCTGAATATTTGAAGGTATGGGCCAGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACTGGCCCATCTTCAAATATT-3′.

Cell proliferation and Western blotting
Cells (1 × 105) were seeded in six-well plate, harvested after
the indicated time, and counted with a Coulter Counter
(Z2 Coulter Counter, Beckman-Coulter). For Western blotting analysis, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed

Statistical analysis
Tests for statistical significance were done using a paired,
two-tailed Student's t test. Values represents mean ± SD (n = 3;
*, P < 0.05). All data (mean ± SD) are representative of at least
three independent experiments.

Reduced ROS and Cell Transformation

Results
As3+ induces cell transformation
The transformative capability of As3+ has long been established in several types of the mammalian cells (19, 20). To
determine whether As3+ is capable of inducing transformation of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B,
we cultured the cells in a medium containing 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1,
and 2 μmol/L of As3+ for 24 weeks. In agreement with previous studies (20), a morphologic change of the cells from
epithelioid to fibroblast-like with multiple foci occurred in
all of the cells with continuous As3+ treatment for 24 weeks
(Fig. 1A). Such a change was not observed in cells cultured in
the As 3+ -free medium for 24 weeks. To further validate
whether such a morphologic change of the long-term As3+treated cells reflected transformation of the cells, we next
evaluated the anchorage-independent growth of these cells
using a colony formation assay in soft agar. As depicted in
Fig. 1B, the long-term arsenic-treated cells (right), but not

the control cells (left), form multiple colonies in soft agar.
Thus, these data clearly suggested that treatment of the cells
with continuous low concentration of As3+ is able to induce
cell transformation.
To investigate whether the As3+-transformed cells exhibit
an altered cell proliferation rate under the basal and As3+
treatment condition, both nontransformed (control) and
the As3+-transformed cells were treated with As3+ for 24,
48, or 72 hours followed by cell proliferation analysis. For
cells without long-term As3+ treatment, a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth was observed for cells treated with As3+
for 48 and 72 hours (Fig. 1C). At a condition of a 24-hour As3+
treatment, a marginal but statistically significant inhibition
of cell growth can be seen only in cells treated with the highest dosage of As3+, 2 μmol/L. As3+ seems to be unable to
inhibit growth of the As3+-transformed cells at every dosage
and time point tested (Fig. 1D). In contrast, an enhanced cell
proliferation was observed for these cells treated with As3+
for 48 or 72 hours (compare the cells treated with different

control. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; #, P < 0.001.

concentration of As3+ with the control cells). Taken together,
above data clearly suggested that BEAS-2B cells with a longterm low-dose As3+ treatment possess transformative features, including fast proliferation, anchorage-independent
growth, and resistance to As3+ cytotoxicity.
Reduced capability of ROS generation in the As3+transformed cells
ROS have been considered as key mediators for As 3+ induced cell transformation and carcinogenesis (13). To determine whether the capacity of ROS generation was altered
for the As3+-transformed cells, we next measured ROS generation in the nontransformed (control) cells and the As3+transformed cells treated with various doses of As 3+ for
24 or 72 hours through flow cytometry. O2•− and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) were determined by DHE and CM-H2DCFDA
staining, respectively. Both O2•− and H2O2 were induced in the
nontransformed cells by As3+ roughly in a dose-dependent

manner for 72 hours (Fig. 2A and B). In the As3+-transformed
cells, unexpectedly, As3+ failed to induce ROS generation
(Fig. 2C and D). In fact, As3+ treatment even compromised
the generation of ROS relative to the basal level in the As3+transformed cells, suggesting that certain ROS scavenging system was activated in these transformed cells. Reduction in
ROS induction by As3+ in the transformed cells was also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of the cells with DHE
and CM-H2DCFDA, respectively, followed by analyzing images
captured by fluorescence microscope (Fig. 2A and B, insets).
Increased expression of superoxide dismutase 2 and
catalase in the As3+-transformed cells
To delineate the mechanism of decreased generation of
ROS in the As3+-transformed cells, the expression levels of
several proteins important for the intracellular redox regulation were determined. To counteract ROS-induced oxidative
stress, cells have evolved two antioxidation systems: thiol

Reduced ROS and Cell Transformation

Figure 3. Inhibition of SOD and
catalase increases ROS generation
and reduces cell growth of the
transformed cells. A and B, the
transformed cells were treated with
the SOD inhibitor 2-ME, the
catalase inhibitor 3-AT, or both for
48 h. The levels of O2•− and H2O2
were determined then in these
cells by DHE and CM-H2DCFDA
staining, respectively, followed by
flow cytometry. C, increasing ROS

buffering (e.g., glutathione and thioredoxin) and enzymatic
systems [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and peroxidase; ref. 21]. A comparable expression of glutathione reductase, glutathione synthetase (GSS), peroxiredoxin (Prx),
and PrxIII was noted between the nontransformed and As3+transformed cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that these proteins are
not responsible for the reduced ROS induction in the As3+transformed cells. The As 3+ -transformed cells, however,
showed a notable increase in the expression of catalase
and SOD2 relative to the nontransformed cells. Because both
SOD2 and catalase are the major cellular antioxidant enzymes responsible for the removal of O2•− and H2O2 in the
cells, respectively, increased expression of SOD2 and catalase
might be attributed to the decreased induction of ROS by As3+
in the transformed cells.
Increasing ROS generation suppresses growth of the
As3+-transformed cells
Because above data suggest to us that transformed cells
acquired features of fast growth and reduced induction of
ROS generation, we reasoned that increase in ROS generation
should be able to suppress the growth of the As3+-transformed
cells. To test this hypothesis, we first applied specific inhibitors to block the activities of SOD and catalase in the transformed cells. As indicated in Fig. 3A and B, treatment of cells
with 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a potent inhibitor of SOD,
or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), a catalase-specific inhibitor,
caused a substantial increase of O2•− (Fig. 3A) and H2O2
(Fig. 3B). The ROS generation was further potentiated when
cells were treated with both 2-ME and 3-AT.

To determine whether enhanced ROS generation by inhibition of SOD and catalase can affect the growth of the As3+transformed cells, we next measure the cell proliferation rate
following the treatment of cells with SOD and/or catalase inhibitors. Treatment of cells with SOD or catalase inhibitor or
combination of these two inhibitors suppressed proliferation
of the transformed cells at 36, 60, and 84 hours significantly
(Fig. 3C). Furthermore, boosting ROS generation by SOD or
catalase inhibition also decreased anchorage-independent
growth of the As3+-transformed cells (Fig. 3D).
Gene silencing of SOD2 and catalase reduced
proliferation and colony formation of the
As3+-transformed cells
The chemical inhibitors have suffered from off-target effects in different cellular background under many circumstances. To validate the observed effect of the SOD and
catalase inhibitors in the transformed cells, we applied a
mRNA silencing technique to knock down the expression
of SOD2 and catalase, respectively, by artificial miRNAbased gene silencing technique in the transformed cells.
Transfection of cells with the control vector exhibited no
effect on the expression of SOD2 and catalase (Fig. 4A
and B). An appreciable inhibition in the expression of
SOD2 and catalase was observed in cells transfected with
SOD2- or catalase-specific artificial miRNA (Fig. 4A and B).
After 36 hours of transfection, a marginal inhibition of cell
growth was noted in cells with SOD2 silencing or combination of SOD2 and catalase silencing. A pronounced inhibition of cell proliferation by either SOD2 or catalase

silencing, or both, was observed at 60 and 84 hours after
transfection (Fig. 4C). Silencing both SOD2 and catalase
was also capable of inhibiting the anchorage-independent
growth of the transformed cells (Fig. 4D).
Enhanced NF-κB activation in the
As3+-transformed cells
NF-κB has been viewed as a growth-promoting transcription factors by upregulating the transcription of the genes
important for cell cycle and antiapoptotic responses. It
should be plausible, thus, to determine whether an upregulation of NF-κB activation or activity contributes to the
enhanced proliferation of the As3+-transformed cells. The expression levels of the upstream proteins for the activation of
NF-κB as well as the major NF-κB family proteins were compared between the nontransformed and transformed cells by
Western blotting. The transformed cells showed an expression of IKKα, IκBα, pIκBα, and RelB similar with that in
the nontransformed cells, whereas the expression of IKKβ,
IKKγ, and p65 was decreased (Fig. 5A). Intriguingly, the expression of NF-κB1 (p105) was significantly enhanced in the
transformed cells relative to the nontransformed cells
(Fig. 5B). Consequently, the level of p50 protein, a product
of p105 processing, was increased in the transformed cells.
Although the transformed cells showed a decrease of p100,
the level of p52 was increased, suggesting a possible enhancement in the processing of p100 in the As3+-transformed cells
(Fig. 5B).
In correlation with the elevated expression and processing
of NF-κB p105 and p100, the NF-κB DNA binding activity was
increased in the transformed cells (Fig. 5C, top). In agreement with the NF-κB DNA binding activity, immunofluores-

cence staining using NF-κB p50 antibody indicated an
increased nuclear translocation as well as overall expression
of the p50 protein in the transformed cells (Fig. 5C, bottom).
To determine whether reduced ROS generation is responsible
for the increase in NF-κB activation, the ROS generation was
resumed in the transformed cells by SOD or catalase inhibition through either specific inhibitors or artificial miRNA silencing. A decrease in NF-κB DNA binding activity was
revealed in the transformed cells treated with SOD2 and catalase inhibitors (Fig. 5D, compare lane 3 with lane 2) or SOD2
and catalase siRNAs (Fig. 5D, compare lane 5 with lane 4).
Gene silencing of NF-κB p105 reduced proliferation
and colony formation of the As3+-transformed cells
To understand whether enhanced NF-κB activation that
resulted from a decreased generation of ROS in the transformed cells is responsible for the fast growth of the transformed cells, the rate of cell growth was determined by
gene silencing of NF-κB p105 through artificial miRNA. The
silencing effect was confirmed by Western blotting that
showed substantial reduction of both p105 and p50 proteins
(Fig. 6A). A significant decrease in cell growth was observed
at 60 and 84 hours after silencing of p105 (Fig. 6B). Silencing
of p105 also reduced the anchorage-independent growth of
the As3+-transformed cells as determined by the colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 6C and D).

Discussion
We provided evidence in the present report suggesting
that treatment of the BEAS-2B cells with continuous low
concentration of As3+ induces cell transformation and that

Reduced ROS and Cell Transformation

the capacity of ROS generation in the transformed cells was
severely compromised. Such a reduction in ROS generation
seems to be responsible for fast proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and resistance to As3+ toxicity of the transformed cells. A sustained alternative activation of NF-κB
might contribute to the fast and anchorage-independent
growth of these cells due to reduced ROS generation. The fast
growth of the transformed cells could be reversed by either resuming the ROS production through SOD2/catalase inhibition
or gene silencing of NF-κB p105/50.
ROS have long been viewed as major contributors to oxidative injury and DNA damage of tissues or cells (22). A sustained oxidative injury and unrepaired damage on DNA will
be carcinogenic due to accumulation of genetic mutations
that either activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressors. To date, most studies addressed the procarcinogenic
effect of ROS in normal or noncancerous cells. However, a
considerable number of reports implicated importance of
ROS in retaining tumor cell growth or facilitating chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced tumor cell death (23). Emerging evidence suggests that some types of cancer cells adapted
a resistant program in responding to further oxidative stress

by enhancing endogenous antioxidant capacity that lowers
ROS and endows cell survival (24–26). This notion was supported by an earlier study using rat lung epithelial L2 cell
line, which showed that exposure of the cells to low but
continuous levels of exogenous oxidants resulted in an
enhancement of overall cellular antioxidant capacity (27).
The observation that continuous low concentration of As3+
exposure induces cells transformation associated with an
increased expression of SOD2 and catalase agrees with
those earlier reports. In nontransformed cells, As3+ is able
to induce ROS generation in a time- and dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2). It is very likely, thus, that exposure of the
cells to a continuous low concentration of As3+, which can
be viewed as a condition of consistent oxidative stress, might
create a selective pressure to enrich the population of cells
that are able to counteract further induction of ROS. Numerous studies revealed that ROS are pivotal in inducing cell
apoptosis and oxidative inactivation of NF-κB, a major antiapoptotic transcription factor (28, 29). Accordingly, cells with
a reduced capacity of ROS generation will be more proliferative in comparison with cells with a higher capability of ROS
induction.

The observed reduction in ROS generation of the As3+transformed cells is further supported by several recent
studies showing decreased ROS levels in normal and cancer stem cells (30–32). In hematopoietic stem cells, it was
believed that activation of forkhead box Os transcription
factor upregulates the expression of SOD and catalase,
leading to a reduced ROS level and maintenance of longterm self-renewal (33). Reduced level of ROS was also considered as a key mechanism for the radiation resistance of
the cancer stem cells within human breast tumor (30). The
level of ROS is much lower in both human and murine
breast cancer stem cells than the corresponding noncancerous cells. Elevated expression of some ROS-scavenging
molecules, including glutamate-cysteine ligase and GSS,
might be one of the mechanisms for lowering the level
of ROS in these cancer stem cells (30). Given the fact that
ROS are potent inducers of cell apoptosis and antagonists
of NF-κB through direct oxidation of IKK kinase subunits
and NF-κB p50 and p65 proteins, it is not surprising to
note that some cancer cells, especially the cancer stem
cells, evolved an antioxidative program to lower ROS
generation and, consequently, maintain both stemness
and cancer-initiating capabilities. It is also plausible to
speculate that reduced level of ROS attributes to the
resistance of chemotherapy and radiation of the cancer
cells.

In summary, the present study provides evidence showing
that As3+ is able to induce cell transformation and that ROS
generation in the transformed cells was much compromised
relative to the nontransformed cells. Such evidence agrees
with the current concept of redox adaptation of cancer cells
(22). Although it remains to be determined how transformed
cells or cancer stem cells acquire the feature of lower ROS
generation or induction, the findings in this report can provide new insights into the translational cancer research and
therapy. It is expectable, therefore, that the use of agents to
restore or induce ROS accumulation in combination with
conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy will improve
the therapeutic outcomes of tumors.
