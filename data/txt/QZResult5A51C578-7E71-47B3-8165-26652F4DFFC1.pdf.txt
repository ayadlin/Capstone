Abstract
Guggulsterone, a constituent of Indian Ayurvedic medicinal
plant Commiphora mukul, causes apoptosis in cancer cells
but the sequence of events leading to cell death is poorly
understood. We now show that guggulsterone-induced cell
death in human prostate cancer cells is caused by reactive
oxygen intermediate (ROI)–dependent activation of c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Exposure of PC-3 and LNCaP
cells to apoptosis inducing concentrations of guggulsterone
resulted in activation of JNK and p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in both cell lines and activation
of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in LNCaP
cells. The guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in PC-3/LNCaP
cells was partially but statistically significantly attenuated
by pharmacologic inhibition (SP600125) as well as genetic
suppression of JNK activation. On the other hand, pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in PC-3 or LNCaP cells
(SB202190) and ERK1/2 activation in LNCaP cells (PD98059)
did not protect against guggulsterone-induced cell death.
The guggulsterone treatment caused generation of ROI in
prostate cancer cells but not in a normal prostate epithelial
cell line (PrEC), which was also resistant to guggulsteronemediated JNK activation. The guggulsterone-induced JNK
activation as well as cell death in prostate cancer cells was
significantly attenuated by overexpression of catalase and
superoxide dismutase. In addition, guggulsterone treatment
resulted in a decrease in protein level and promoter activity of
androgen receptor in LNCaP cells. In conclusion, the present
study reveals that the guggulsterone-induced cell death in
human prostate cancer cells is regulated by ROI-dependent
activation of JNK and guggulsterone inhibits promoter activity
of androgen receptor. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7439–49]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed
malignancies and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among
men in the United States (1). Prostate carcinogenesis is a multistep
process involving progression from localized and low-grade lesions
to high-grade and metastatic carcinomas. Molecular mechanism
underlying onset and progression of prostate cancer is not fully
understood, but age, race, diet, and androgen secretion and
metabolism are the identifiable risk factors for this malignancy

(2, 3). Therapeutic options exist for localized disease, including
surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy. Androgen
ablation is a frequently prescribed treatment option for prostate
cancer (4). This treatment modality, however, is palliative and has
limited scope especially for hormone-refractory prostate cancers
(4). Moreover, chemo and radiation therapies are largely ineffective
against advanced prostate cancer (5, 6). Prostate cancer is usually
diagnosed in the sixth and seventh decades of life, which allows a
large window of opportunity for intervention to prevent or slow
progression of the disease. Therefore, clinical development of
agents that are nontoxic to normal prostate epithelial cells but can
delay onset and/or progression of human prostate cancer could
have a significant effect on disease-related cost, morbidity, and
mortality for a large segment of population. Guggulsterone
[4,17(20)-pregnadien-3,16-dione], a plant sterol derived from the
gum resin of the Commiphora mukul, meets these criteria and
seems promising for prevention of prostate cancer.
Guggulsterone or gum guggul have been used extensively in
Indian Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of different
disorders, including bone fracture, arthritis, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and lipid disorders (7–11). Recent studies have
shown that guggulsterone is an antagonist of farnesoid X receptor
(12, 13). In addition, guggulsterone has been shown to increase
transcription of bile salt export pump (14). Our interest in
guggulsterone stemmed from a recent study documenting
suppression of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activation in tumor
cells by this phytochemical (15). NF-nB is a transcription factor
belonging to the Rel family of proteins that are involved in
regulation of expression of various genes including inflammatory
cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors,
and IFNs (16, 17). NF-nB activation is considered a prosurvival
signal because this transcription factor regulates expression of
several antiapoptotic genes, including cIAP1, XIAP, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2,
cFLIP, and survivin (18–25).
Because NF-nB is constitutively activated in a variety of
hematologic and solid tumor cells, including prostate cancer cells
(26–31), we raised the question of whether guggulsterone can
suppress proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. Indeed, we
found that guggulsterone inhibits growth of PC-3 human prostate
cancer cells by causing apoptotic cell death (32). Interestingly,
growth of a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) is minimally
affected by guggulsterone treatment even at concentrations that
are highly cytotoxic to the PC-3 cells (32). We also found that
guggulsterone-induced cell death in PC-3 cells is independent of
Bcl-2 but correlates with induction of Bax and Bak proteins and
activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 (32). Despite
these advances, not much is known about the upstream signal(s)
that triggers guggulsterone-induced apoptosis. The present study
provides compelling experimental evidence to indicate that

guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells is
initiated by reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI)–mediated activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK).

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Z-guggulsterone was purchased from Steraloids. Tissue
culture medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Invitrogen;
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was from Sigma; and hydroethidine and 6-carboxy2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) diacetate (H2DCFDA) were from
Molecular Probes. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor PD98059, p38
MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and JNK inhibitor SP600125 were purchased
from Calbiochem. The ELISA kit for quantitation of cytoplasmic histoneassociated DNA fragmentation was from Roche Diagnostics. Antibodies
specific for detection of total and phospho-(Tyr204)-ERK1/2, total and
phospho-(Thr183/Tyr185)-JNK, and total and phospho-(Tyr182)-p38 MAPK
and androgen receptor were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the
antibodies against Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), manganese
SOD (Mn-SOD), and catalase were from Calbiochem; the anti-Flag
antibody was from Sigma; and anti-actin antibody was from Oncogene
Research Products.
Cell lines and cell culture. The PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145 human
prostate cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. Monolayer cultures of PC-3 and DU145 cells were maintained as
described previously (32, 33). Monolayer cultures of LNCaP cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) nonheat inactivated
FBS, antibiotics, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and
2.4 mg/mL glucose. Normal prostate epithelial cell line PrEC (Clonetics) was
maintained as described previously (32). Each cell line was maintained in
a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37jC.
Immunoblotting. Stock solution of guggulsterone was prepared in
DMSO and diluted with fresh complete medium. Cells were treated with
DMSO ( final concentration, 0.1%) or desired concentrations of guggulsterone for specified time intervals and lysed as described previously (32).
Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblotting was done as described
previously (32, 33). The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence method. Each membrane was stripped and reprobed
with anti-actin antibody to normalize for differences in protein loading.
Determination of apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by guggulsterone was
assessed by analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation
as described previously (32). In some experiments, cells were pretreated for
2 h with desired MAPK inhibitor before guggulsterone treatment and
assessment of apoptosis.
Measurement of ROI generation. Intracellular ROI generation was
measured by flow cytometry following staining with hydroethidine and
H2DCFDA as described by us previously (33). Briefly, 3  105 cells were
plated in 60-mm culture dishes, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed to
DMSO (control) or different concentrations of guggulsterone for specified
time intervals. The cells were stained with 2 Amol/L hydroethidine and
5 Amol/L 2¶,7¶,-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) for 30 min
at 37jC. The cells were collected and the fluorescence was analyzed using a
Coulter Epics XL Flow Cytometer. In some experiments, cells were
pretreated with NAC for 2 h before guggulsterone exposure and analysis
of ROI generation.
Adenoviral infection. Adenoviral constructs encoding enhanced green
fluorescence protein (Ad.EGFP), catalase (Ad.Catalase), Flag-tagged JNK
binding domain (JBD) of JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1; Ad.JBD), Cu,ZnSOD (Ad.Cu,Zn-SOD), and Mn-SOD (Ad.Mn-SOD) were a generous gift from
Dr. Yong Lee (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). For infection, DU145
or LNCaP cells (2.5  105) were plated in 60-mm culture dishes, allowed to
attach, and infected with Ad.EGFP, Ad.Catalase, Ad.JBD, Ad.Cu,Zn-SOD, or
Ad.Mn-SOD [50 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for DU145 and 100 MOI for
LNCaP]. After 36 h of incubation at 37jC, the cells were treated with DMSO
or desired concentrations of guggulsterone for specified time intervals and
processed for immunoblotting, analysis of ROI generation, or analysis of
cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation.

Luciferase assay. LNCaP cells were seeded at a density of 2  105 cells
per well in 12-well plates. After overnight culture, cells were transiently
cotransfected with 0.5 Ag pARLUC plasmid (a generous gift from
Dr. William H. Walker, Department of Cell Biology and Physiology,
University of Pittsburgh) and 0.05 Ag pRL-CMV plasmid using Fugene 6
transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were
exposed to desired concentration of guggulsterone for 24 h, washed with
ice-cold PBS, and harvested in reporter lysis buffer. The samples were
centrifuged and a 20 AL supernatant fraction was used for measurement of
dual luciferase activity (Promega) using a luminometer. The luciferase
activity was normalized and expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase to
Renilla luciferase units.

Results
Guggulsterone treatment activated JNK and p38 MAPK in
PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Guggulsterone has been shown to suppress
growth of cancer cells including acute myeloid leukemia and
PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines by causing apoptosis (32, 34)
but the sequence of events leading to cell death is poorly defined.
To gain insights into the mechanism of guggulsterone-induced
apoptosis, we determined its effect on activating phosphorylations
of JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185), p38 MAPK (Tyr182), and ERK1/2 (Tyr204),
which are implicated in regulation of cell survival and apoptosis
by different stimuli including various cancer preventive agents
(35–40). Figure 1A summarizes data on effect of guggulsterone
treatment on activating phosphorylations of different MAPKs in
PC-3 cells. Exposure of PC-3 cells to growth-suppressive and
apoptosis-inducing concentrations of guggulsterone (20 and 40
Amol/L; refs. 32, 34) resulted in rapid and concentration-dependent
increase in Thr183/Tyr185 phosphorylation of JNK1/2, which was
evident as early as 30 min after treatment (Fig. 1A). Guggulsteronemediated hyperphosphorylation of JNK1/2 was not due to increase
in the levels of total JNK1/2 proteins (data not shown).
Guggulsterone treatment also increased phosphorylation of p38
MAPK at Tyr182 that was clearly evident at 2- to 4-h time points
(Fig. 1A). Similar to JNK1/2, guggulsterone treatment did not
cause any appreciable change in total p38 protein level (data not
shown). On the other hand, exposure of PC-3 cells to guggulsterone
resulted in suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation at Tyr204.
For instance, constitutive activation (phosphorylation) of ERK1/2
was decreased by f80% to 90% following a 4-h treatment of
PC-3 cells with 20 and 40 Amol/L guggulsterone compared with
DMSO-treated control as judged by densitometric scanning of the
immunoreactive bands after correction for actin loading control
(Fig. 1A). Guggulsterone-mediated suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not due to a decrease in the levels of ERK1/2
proteins (data not shown).
To test whether guggulsterone-mediated changes in MAPK
phosphorylation observed in PC-3 were restricted to this cell line,
we determined the effect of guggulsterone treatment on
phosphorylation of JNK1/2, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2 using LNCaP
cells and the results are shown in Fig. 1B. The LNCaP cell line is
androgen responsive and expresses wild-type (WT) p53, whereas
PC-3 cells are androgen independent and lack functional p53.
Similar to PC-3 cells, guggulsterone treatment resulted in rapid
and marked increase in phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38
MAPK in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B). Unlike PC-3 cells, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was increased by treatment with guggulsterone, at
least at 1-h time point at both 20 and 40 Amol/L concentrations
(Fig. 1B ). Guggulsterone-mediated hyperphosphorylation of
ERK1/2 in LNCaP cells correlated with induction of ERK1/2

protein expression (data not shown). Collectively, these results
indicated that guggulsterone treatment increased activating
phosphorylations of both JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in human
prostate cancer cell lines irrespective of their androgen responsiveness or p53 status, albeit with different time course kinetics.
On the other hand, guggulsterone treatment exhibited differential
response on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PC-3 (decrease) versus
LNCaP cells (increase).
Guggulsterone-induced DNA fragmentation was attenuated
by pharmacologic inhibition of JNK1/2 activation in PC-3 and
LNCaP cells. Next, we proceeded to determine the functional
significance of MAPK activation in guggulsterone-induced apopto-

sis using pharmacologic inhibitors of JNK1/2 (SP600125), p38
MAPK (SB202190), and MEK1 (PD98059; an upstream kinase
implicated in activation of ERK1/2). The guggulsterone-mediated
hyperphosphorylation of JNK1/2 in PC-3 cells was fully blocked
in the presence of SP600125 (Fig. 2A, left, compare lanes 2 and 4).
The cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation (apoptosis) resulting from a 24-h exposure of PC-3 cells to both 20 and
40 Amol/L guggulsterone was partially but statistically significantly
attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition of JNK1/2 activation
(Fig. 2A, right). Guggulsterone-mediated hyperphosphorylation of
p38 MAPK was abrogated in the presence of 20 Amol/L SB202190
(data not shown). However, pharmacologic inhibition of p38

JNK Activation in Guggulsterone-Induced Apoptosis

with anti-actin antibody to correct for differences in protein loading. Cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation in DU145 (B) and LNCaP (D ) cells infected with

P < 0.05, significantly different compared with corresponding DMSO-treated control and cells infected with Ad.EGFP, respectively, by one-way ANOVA followed

MAPK activation by SB202190 did not have any appreciable effect
on guggulsterone-induced cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA
fragmentation in PC-3 cells (Fig. 2A, right).
To confirm that the JNK1/2 dependence of guggulsteroneinduced apoptosis was not restricted to the PC-3 cell line, we
determined the effect of SP600125 on guggulsterone-mediated
apoptosis using LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 2B (left), SP600125
offered protection against guggulsterone-mediated hyperphosphorylation of JNK1/2 in LNCaP cells as well. Similar to PC-3 cells, the
cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation resulting from
a 24-h exposure of LNCaP cells to 20 and 40 Amol/L guggulsterone
was statistically significantly attenuated by SP600125 (Fig. 2B,
right). Interestingly, unlike PC-3 cells, a 2-h pretreatment of LNCaP
cells with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, which resulted in full
inhibition of p38 MAPK activation (data not shown), caused an
increase in guggulsterone-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation especially at 40 Amol/L concentration (Fig. 2B,
right). Collectively, these results pointed toward an important
role of JNK1/2 in regulation of guggulsterone-induced cell death
in human prostate cancer cells.
Because guggulsterone treatment resulted in activation of ERK1/
2 in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B), we proceeded to determine possible
contribution of this MAPK in regulation of cell death in LNCaP
cells. As can be seen in Fig. 2C (left), guggulsterone-mediated
increase in Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was completely
abolished in the presence of 50 Amol/L PD98059. However,
pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2 activation by PD98059 did
not have any appreciable effect on guggulsterone-induced cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2C, right).

www.aacrjournals.org

These results argued against ERK1/2 involvement in guggulsterone-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP cells.
Overexpression of JBD of JIP-1 attenuated guggulsteroneinduced JNK1/2 activation and apoptosis. The relationship
between JNK1/2 activation and apoptosis induction by guggulsterone was further investigated by determining the effect of
adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Flag-tagged JBD of JIP-1
on guggulsterone-induced apoptosis. JIP-1 is a cytoplasmic scaffold
protein that selectively binds to and inhibits activity of JNK but not
other members of the MAPK cascade (41, 42). Overexpression of JBD
of JIP-1 has been shown to inhibit JNK activation in response to
different stimuli (43, 44). Because PC-3 cells are not easily infected
with adenoviruses, we used another androgen-independent human
prostate cancer cell line (DU145) for these studies. Overexpression
of JBD of JIP-1 in DU145 cells infected with Flag-tagged JBD (Ad.JBD)
was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3A,
top). Cells infected with an adenoviral construct encoding EGFP
(Ad.EGFP) were used as a control. An average infection efficiency
of f60% to 80% was observed in different experiments as judged
by fluorescence microscopic analysis of EGFP (data not shown).
In DU145 cells infected with Ad.EGFP (control), exposure to 20 and
40 Amol/L guggulsterone resulted in hyperphosphorylation of
JNK1/2 compared with DMSO-treated control (Fig. 3A, bottom).
A similar guggulsterone treatment in DU145 cells infected with
Ad.JBD failed to significantly increase phosphorylation of JNK1/2
over DMSO-treated control. A 24-h exposure to guggulsterone
resulted in a concentration-dependent and statistically significant
increase in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation in
DU145 cells infected with Ad.EGFP, which was relatively less

pronounced in cells infected with Ad-JBD especially at 40 Amol/L
concentration (Fig. 3B).
The effect of overexpression of JBD of JIP-1 on guggulsteroneinduced JNK1/2 activation and cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation was also determined in LNCaP cells and the
results are summarized in Fig. 3C and D. Similar to DU145 cells,
treatment of control LNCaP cells (infected with Ad.EGFP) with
guggulsterone caused an increase in the levels of phospho-JNK1/2
compared with DMSO-treated control. On the other hand, the
guggulsterone-mediated hyperphosphorylation of JNK1/2 was not
observed in LNCaP cells infected with Ad.JBD (Fig. 3C, bottom).
Consistent with the results of studies using JNK1/2 inhibitor
SP600125 (Fig. 2B), the cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA
fragmentation induced by a 24-h exposure to 40 Amol/L
guggulsterone was statistically significantly inhibited in LNCaP
cells overexpressing JBD of JIP-1 (Fig. 3D). These results provided
additional evidence for involvement of JNK1/2 in regulation of
guggulsterone-induced apoptosis.
Guggulsterone treatment caused ROI generation in PC-3
and LNCaP cells. Previous studies have shown that JNKmediated apoptosis in some systems is associated with generation
of hydrogen peroxide as a second messenger (45, 46). We raised
the question of whether guggulsterone-induced JNK1/2 activation
in human prostate cancer cells involved ROI generation. To
address this question, initially, we determined the effect of
guggulsterone treatment on ROI generation using PC-3 and
LNCaP cells. Intracellular ROI generation in control (DMSO
treated) and guggulsterone-treated PC-3/LNCaP cells was
assessed by flow cytometry. The H2DCFDA is cleaved by
nonspecific cellular esterases and oxidized in the presence of
H2O2 and other peroxides to yield fluorescent DCF that can be
monitored by flow cytometry. The guggulsterone-treated PC-3
cells exhibited a dose-dependent increase in DCF fluorescence
compared with control (Fig. 4A, left). For instance, the DCF
fluorescence in PC-3 cells treated for 4 h with 20, 40, and
60 Amol/L guggulsterone was increased by f1.6-, 1.8-, and
2.0-fold, respectively (P < 0.05 compared with DMSO-treated
control at each guggulsterone concentration as judged by oneway ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test) compared with vehicletreated control (Fig. 4A, left). In time course experiments using
40 Amol/L guggulsterone, statistically significant increase in DCF
fluorescence over DMSO-treated control in LNCaP cells was
evident as early as 4 h after treatment and increased gradually
with increasing exposure time (Fig. 4A, right). To test whether
guggulsterone-mediated activation of JNK1/2 in prostate cancer
cells was linked to ROI generation, we determined the levels
of phospho-JNK1/2 in PC-3/LNCaP cells treated for 4 h with
20 Amol/L guggulsterone in the absence or presence of 4 mmol/L
NAC (2-h pretreatment), a known antioxidant. As can be seen in
Fig. 4B, guggulsterone-mediated activation of JNK1/2 in both
PC-3 (Fig. 4B, left) and LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B, right) was significantly attenuated in the presence of NAC. These results indicated
that guggulsterone-mediated activation of JNK1/2 in prostate
cancer cells was indeed caused by ROI generation.
Normal prostate epithelial cell line PrEC was resistant to
ROI generation and JNK1/2 activation by guggulsterone. We
have shown previously that PrEC normal prostate epithelial cell
line is resistant to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by
guggulsterone (32). We raised the question of whether resistance of
PrEC cells to guggulsterone-induced apoptosis was due to lack of
ROI generation and consequently JNK1/2 activation. We addressed

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

this question by determining the effect of guggulsterone treatment
on ROI generation and JNK activation using PrEC cells. As can
be seen in Fig. 4C (left), exposure of PrEC cells to 40 Amol/L
guggulsterone failed to cause an increase in DCF fluorescence even
after 6 h of treatment, indicating lack of ROI generation. Moreover,
guggulsterone treatment resulted in marginal increase in JNK1/2
phosphorylation in PrEC cells even after 4 h of treatment with
40 Amol/L concentration (Fig. 4C, right). These results indicated
that PrEC cells were resistant to ROI generation as well as JNK1/2
activation by guggulsterone, which may explain lack of apoptosis
by this agent in PrEC cells (32).
Overexpression of catalase attenuated guggulsteronemediated JNK1/2 activation and apoptosis in DU145 cells. To
further examine the relationship between ROI generation, JNK1/2
activation, and apoptosis in our model, we determined the effect of
adenovirus-mediated overexpression of catalase, an enzyme responsible for conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water molecules, on
guggulsterone-mediated JNK1/2 activation and apoptosis using
DU145 cells and LNCaP cells. The level of catalase protein was
markedly higher in DU145 (Fig. 5A) and LNCaP cells (data not
shown) infected with Ad.Catalase compared with control cells
infected with Ad.EGFP as revealed by immunoblotting. Activation
of JNK caused by treatment with 40 Amol/L guggulsterone in
DU145 (Fig. 5B) and LNCaP cells (data not shown) was markedly
suppressed by overexpression of catalase as indicated by immunoblotting for phospho-JNK1/2 levels. Catalase overexpression also
conferred statistically significant protection against guggulsteroneinduced apoptosis as judged by analysis of cytoplasmic histoneassociated DNA fragmentation in DU145 cells. For instance, a
24-h exposure of Ad.EGFP cells to 40 Amol/L guggulsterone
resulted in f3-fold increase in cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation relative to DMSO-treated control (Fig. 5C). The
cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation was increased
by only f40% on a similar guggulsterone treatment in Ad.Catalase
cells (Fig. 5C). The guggulsterone-mediated generation of ROI
was also suppressed significantly in catalase-overexpressing cells
compared with cells infected with Ad.EGFP (Fig. 5D). These
results confirmed that guggulsterone-mediated JNK1/2 activation
and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells were linked to ROI
generation.
SOD overexpression conferred significant protection against
guggulsterone-induced JNK1/2 activation and apoptosis.
Superoxide is the primary oxygen-free radical produced by
mitochondria and is rapidly removed by conversion to hydrogen
peroxide in a reaction catalyzed by SOD (47). At least three SODs
exist in mammalian cells, including a cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD (SOD1),
an intramitochondrial Mn-SOD (SOD2), and an extracellular
Cu,Zn-SOD (SOD3). To test whether guggulsterone-mediated
H2O2 production, which was revealed by an increase in DCF
fluorescence (Fig. 4A) and consequently JNK1/2 activation in our
model involved mitochondrial superoxide, we determined the
effects of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD overexpression on guggulsterone-induced JNK1/2 activation using DU145 cells. As can be seen
in Fig. 6A, infection of DU145 cells with an adenovirus encoding
Mn-SOD (Ad.Mn-SOD cells) resulted in overexpression of MnSOD, whose expression was very weak in cells infected with
Ad.EGFP. Treatment of Ad.EGFP cells with 20 and 40 Amol/L
guggulsterone caused between 8- and 16-fold increase in the
levels of phospho-JNK1/2 compared with DMSO-treated control.
The guggulsterone-mediated hyperphosphorylation of JNK1/2 was
markedly suppressed in Mn-SOD–overexpressing DU145 cells

(Fig. 6A). Similarly, guggulsterone-induced activation of JNK1/2
was markedly attenuated in DU145 cells infected with Ad.Cu,ZnSOD compared with Ad.EGFP cells (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of
both Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD conferred statistically significant
protection against guggulsterone-induced cytoplasmic histoneassociated DNA fragmentation especially at 40 Amol/L concentration compared with Ad.EGFP cells (Fig. 6B). These results pointed
toward mitochondrial superoxide generation in guggulsteronemediated JNK activation and apoptosis.
Guggulsterone treatment inhibited androgen receptor
promoter activity in LNCaP cells. We raised the question of
whether guggulsterone treatment affects expression of androgen
receptor. We addressed this question by determining the effect of

guggulsterone treatment on protein level of androgen receptor by
immunoblotting using LNCaP cells. The PC-3 cell lysate was
included as a negative control. As can be seen in Fig. 6C, androgen
receptor protein expression was detectable in LNCaP cells but not
in the androgen-independent cell line PC-3. The guggulsterone
treatment (40 Amol/L) caused a modest decrease (f30–40%
decrease relative to control) in protein level of androgen receptor
especially at the 16- and 24-h time points (Fig. 6C). Next, we
determined the effect of guggulsterone treatment on promoter
activity of androgen receptor by luciferase reporter assay
using pARLUC plasmid (48), and the results are summarized in
Fig. 6D. Exposure of LNCaP cells to 40 Amol/L guggulsterone for
24 h resulted in f40% decrease in androgen receptor promoter

activity (P < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test). A
decrease in androgen receptor promoter activity was also evident
at 20 Amol/L guggulsterone concentration, although the difference
did not reach statistical significance. These results indicated that

the guggulsterone-mediated decline in androgen receptor protein
level was probably due to repression of the androgen receptor
promoter activity.

An understanding of the mechanism by which guggulsterone
causes apoptotic cell death in human prostate cancer cells but not
in normal prostate epithelial cell line is necessary for its further
clinical development because this knowledge could lead to
identification of mechanism-based biomarkers potentially useful
in future clinical trials. The present study indicates that the cell
death caused by guggulsterone in human prostate cancer cells is
tightly linked to activation of JNK1/2. The correlation between
guggulsterone-mediated apoptosis induction and JNK1/2 activation is not a cell line–specific effect and not affected by p53 status
either. This conclusion is based on the following observations:
(a) guggulsterone treatment causes activation of JNK1/2 in both
androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3
and DU145) human prostate cells with WT (LNCaP) as well as
mutant p53 expression (DU145); (b) the guggulsterone-induced
apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells is partially but
statistically significantly attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition
of JNK1/2 activation; (c) genetic suppression of JNK1/2 activation
by ectopic expression of JBD of JIP-1 confers partial yet significant
protection against guggulsterone-induced cytoplasmic histoneassociated DNA fragmentation especially at higher concentration;
and (d) guggulsterone treatment causes very weak activation of
JNK1/2 in PrEC normal prostate epithelial cells, which are resistant
to growth arrest and apoptosis induction by guggulsterone (32).
Because guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
is only partially attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition as well as
genetic suppression of JNK1/2 activation, it is reasonable to
conclude that JNK1/2 activation alone may not fully account for
the cell death in our model.
Unlike JNK1/2, effect of guggulsterone on p38 MAPK and
ERK1/2 seems cell line specific. For instance, despite activation of
p38 MAPK on treatment with guggulsterone in both PC-3 and
LNCaP cells, pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK has different
effect on guggulsterone-induced cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation in these cells. In PC-3 cells, apoptosis
induction by guggulsterone is not influenced by inhibition of
p38 MAPK activation. On the other hand, pharmacologic
inhibition of p38 MAPK activation in LNCaP cells leads to
potentiation of guggulsterone-induced cell death. Similarly,
guggulsterone treatment suppresses constitutive ERK1/2 activation in PC-3 cells but increases its phosphorylation at Tyr204 in
LNCaP cells; although pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2
activation in LNCaP cells fails to confer significant protection
against guggulsterone-induced cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation. Although the molecular basis for cell line–
specific effects of guggulsterone on p38 MAPK and ERK1/2
activation remains elusive, the possibility of p53 involvement in
differential response cannot be ignored. For example, ERK1/2- and
p38 MAPK–dependent phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 has been
implicated in UV-induced apoptosis (49, 50). Further studies are
needed to explore the possible role of p53 in differential response
and cellular outcome of guggulsterone-mediated p38 MAPK/
ERK1/2 activation in PC-3 versus LNCaP cells. Nonetheless, it is
clear that JNK1/2 activation positively correlates with guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells and seems

JNK Activation in Guggulsterone-Induced Apoptosis

independent of androgen responsiveness or p53 status. We are
tempted to speculate that JNK1/2 activation may be a viable
biomarker of guggulsterone response at least for prostate cancer.
The guggulsterone-mediated JNK1/2 activation in human prostate cancer cells correlates with generation of ROI. Guggulsteronemediated JNK1/2 activation and/or apoptosis are significantly
attenuated by small-molecule antioxidant NAC and/or ectopic
expression of enzymes responsible for inactivation of hydrogen
peroxide (catalase) or dismutation of superoxide anion (Cu,ZnSOD and Mn-SOD). Although activation of JNK1/2 was not
studied, guggulsterone-mediated generation of ROI has been
observed in acute myeloid leukemia cell line U937 (34).

Collectively, these results indicate that ROI generation is probably
an important event in guggulsterone-induced apoptosis. However,
the fundamental questions requiring further investigation are
how guggulsterone induces oxidative stress and how ROI
generation triggers JNK1/2 signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are an important source of cellular ROI, which are
generated during incomplete reduction of oxygen primarily by
redox cycling of ubiquinone from the electrons that escape
during normal oxidative phosphorylation (47). Possibly, guggulsterone targets mitochondria to trigger ROI generation, which is
highly likely because JNK1/2 activation and apoptosis induction
by this agent are significantly attenuated by overexpression of

intramitochondrial Mn-SOD. At the same time, the possibility
that guggulsterone depletes intracellular reduced glutathione
to trigger ROI generation cannot be ruled out. With regards
to the connection between ROI generation and JNK activation,
the increase in steady-state levels of intracellular ROI can be
detected through redox-sensing molecules, including thioredoxin
and glutaredoxin. These molecules bind to apoptosis signalregulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and suppress its activation (43). Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin dissociate from ASK1 during oxidative
stress and their dissociation from ASK1 activates the ASK1/SEK1/
JNK1 signal transduction pathway (43). We postulate that
guggulsterone-mediated ROI generation is detected by redoxsensing molecules leading to activation of ASK1/JNK1/2 signal
transduction pathway.
We used LNCaP and PC-3/DU145 cell lines as well-characterized representatives of androgen-responsive and androgenindependent human prostate cancer cells, respectively, to gauge
into possible effect of androgen responsiveness on apoptosis
induction by guggulsterone. Although guggulsterone-induced
apoptosis was observed in all three cell lines, we also observed
a modest decrease in protein level of androgen receptor in
LNCaP cells. The guggulsterone-mediated decline in androgen
receptor protein level correlated with inhibition of androgen
receptor promoter activity as revealed by the luciferase reporter
assay. These results suggest that the guggulsterone-mediated

decline in protein level of androgen receptor is probably the
result of repression of the androgen receptor promoter. Previous
studies have shown that androgen receptor promoter activity is
stimulated by overexpression of NF-nB subunits in Sertoli cells
(48). Because guggulsterone treatment inhibits NF-nB activation
(15), it seems reasonable to postulate that guggulsteronemediated inhibition of androgen receptor promoter in LNCaP
cells may be caused by inhibition of NF-nB. However, further
studies are needed to systematically explore this possibility.
In conclusion, the present study offers novel insights into the
mechanism of guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in human prostate
cancer cells and shows a tight link between ROI generation, JNK1/2
activation, and the cell death process. Based on these observations,
we propose that JNK1/2 activation may be a useful biomarker for
guggulsterone response.
