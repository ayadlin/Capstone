Abstract:

When one considers the organism Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S.
Typhimurium), one usually thinks of the Gram-negative enteric pathogen that
causes the severe food borne illness, gastroentertitis. In this context, the idea of
Salmonella being exploited as a cancer therapeutic seems pretty remote. However,
there has been an escalating interest in the development of tumor-therapeutic
bacteria for use in the treatment of a variety of cancers. This strategy takes
advantage of the remarkable ability of certain bacteria to preferentially replicate
and accumulate within tumors. In the case of S. Typhimurium, this organism infects
and selectively grows within implanted tumors, achieving tumor/normal tissue
ratios of approximately 1,000:1. Salmonella also has some attractive properties well
suited for the design of a chemotherapeutic agent. In particular, this pathogen can
easily be manipulated to carry foreign genes, and since this species is a facultative
anaerobe, it is able to survival in both oxygenated and hypoxic conditions,
implying this organism could colonize both small metastatic lesions as well as
larger tumors. These observations are the impetus to a burgeoning field focused
on the development of Salmonella as a clinically useful anti-cancer agent. We will
discuss three cutting edge technologies employing Salmonella to target tumors.

Introduction

tumors signifying that bacterial therapeutic conduits may
serve as a unique portal to a wide variety of malignancies.
Recent advances in molecular biology, as well as the
complete sequencing of many bacterial genomes, have
fueled a resurgence of interest in bacteria as drug delivery
vehicles and tumoricidal agents. Here we will highlight
recent advances exploiting the use of the food-borne
pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S.
Typhimurium), as an intriguing chemotherapeutic agent.

Bacteria have been investigated as therapeutic
agents for tumors for over 150 years, when it was first
observed by William B. Coley that a fraction of cancer
patients who developed post-operative bacterial infections
went into remission and were cured of their tumors [1].
Although the mechanisms underlying this observation
were unclear, it was known even then that bacteria
exhibit immunostimulatory properties. Moreover, it has
been known for nearly 50 years that anaerobic bacteria
can selectively grow in tumors, underscoring the fact
that such microbes have the potential to overcome
many of the delivery barriers that hinder conventional
chemotherapeutics [2]. In particular, the conditions that
permit anaerobic bacterial growth, such as impaired
circulation, and extensive necrosis, are found in many

The benefits of bacterial cancer
therapy
Current chemotherapeutics (and radiation) used
in the treatment of cancer patients have considerable
limitations, including toxicity, poor tumor targeting,
and inadequate tissue penetration, which together often

result in incomplete destruction of the tumors. Selected
bacteria, however, can be manipulated to overcome many
of the limitations that frequently hamper current cancer
regiments by directly targeting cancer cells, killing these
cells through innate bacterial toxicity, competition for
nutrients or delivery of anti-cancer agents. Salmonella,
Clostridium, Escherichia, Bifodobacterium, Caulobacter
and Listeria species have all been tested for their potential
use in cancer therapy with varying degrees of success
[3,4,5,6,7,8].
Bacterial toxins that are highly immunogenic have
also been manipulated by linking them to tumor antigens
in an attempt to elicit an immune response to tumors and
sensitize the immune system to tumor presence [9,10].
Furthermore, bacteria such as S. Typhimurium have an
innate advantage as a chemotherapeutic considering they
are attracted to cancer cells by compounds released by

necrotic or quiescent cells within the tumor, thereby they
can be used to either infect cells or deliver compounds
directly to the tumor site [8,11,12,13]. Interestingly,
bacteria have also evolved to overcome several of the
limitations of conventional therapy given that these
organisms can penetrate deep into tumors and are
unaffected by the immune evasion strategies deployed
by tumors that can make cancer treatment so challenging
(Figure 1).

Salmonella Typhimurium as a
treatment option
Clostridium and Salmonella species have historically
been used most successfully as anti-cancer microbes
[1,2,14,15,16]. These organisms have been used directly
as therapeutics, as well as delivery vehicles for anti-

how the conventional chemotherapeutic agent (blue pentagon) is unable to penetrate deep into the fast growing tumor. Blue box represents
the engineered-Salmonella therapy. Salmonella offers several advantages like (i) tumor-specificity, (ii)self-replicating potential, (iii) ability to be
genetically engineered with either (a) gene silencing (red box), or (b) tumor sensitizing  (brown box) or (c) bacterial toxin/effectors producing
methodologies (purple box), leading to tumor regression by caspase-3 mediated and other mechanisms, (iv) ability to migrate to distal regions
of the tumor and (v) most importantly to induce gap-junction in tumors leading to immune activation against the tumor.

cancer therapeutics. However, recent advances in tumor
targeting with attenuated S. Typhimurium have selected
this pathogen as the bacterium of choice for cancer therapy
development resulting in it being employed in human
trials [17,18,19]. Moreover, unlike the strictly anaerobic
Clostridium which must be delivered in spore form, S.
Typhimurium is motile, easily genetically manipulated,
and grows as a facultative anaerobe in the presence
or absence of oxygen. These and other advantages
(summarized in Table 1) allow S. Typhimurium to not only
target tumors, but also deliver therapeutic compounds or

immune modulators to the tumor site.
The anoxic environment often found in tumors
makes the tumor site an attractive niche for S.
Typhimurium growth. Through the use of their flagella,
Salmonella migrate towards the tumor, attracted by the
high concentrations of nutrients available within the
tumor microenvironment [20,21,22]. The metabolism of
S. Typhimurium has been exploited to attenuate the strains
used in cancer therapy, manipulating the bacteria so that
they grow only at tumor sites. Metabolic genes have
been removed from S. Typhimurium, such as purI in the

used in combination with the native toxicity of Salmonella
may offer a fascinating alternative to traditional gene
therapy approach.
It is envisaged that specific anti-cancer molecules
delivered by S. Typhimurium can be used to target the
outer regions of the tumor with the bacteria invading
deep within the tumor, penetrating regions of the tumor
architecture that conventional therapies cannot reach
[12,32]. One of the key challenges with conventional
chemotherapy is delivery of potentially toxic agents
to the appropriate areas of the tumor while preventing
damage to healthy tissue. Temporal control over bacterial
delivery of therapeutic agents is a key consideration as
delivery of these compounds during transit to the tumor
site will distribute products systemically and increase
toxicity in healthy tissues. Inducible gene promoters offer
a solution that is presently employed. Detection of small
molecules by the bacteria, or irradiation at the point where
expression is required, have both been used successfully
in vivo along with the use of pro-drugs introduced at the
tumor site for conversion into an anticancer agent by
the bacteria upon contact [13,32,33]. recA, the radiation
inducible promoter, was linked to tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) to
control its expression by Salmonella during infection
of tumors [32]. S. Typhimurium at the tumor site was
then induced to express TRAIL by doses of radiation,
which simultaneously treated the tumor. S. Typhimurium
promoters specifically induced by hypoxia have been
identified and may be of use in the future, with bacterial
expression of a therapeutic compound activated once the
bacteria reach the tumor [33].
A second approach for controlling therapeutic
delivery is the construction of bacteria that produce
enzymes converting harmless pro-drugs into active
agents inside the tumor. Toward this goal Salmonella has
been engineered to express cytosine deaminase (CDase)
that cleaves the pro-drug 5-fluorocytosine to the active
chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouricil [13,18].

mutant strain VNP20009, rendering the mutant bacterium
auxotrophic for certain compounds that are found in very
high concentrations at tumor sites, in this case purines
[23]. Such genetic engineering, forces migration of S.
Typhimurium towards tumors in order to survive and
results in the bacteria accumulating at the tumor site at
over a 1,000 times higher levels than in normal tissue [24].
Migration towards the tumor site is based on the
ability of S. Typhimurium to sense nutrients using a
number of receptors that are located at the bacterial poles
on the outer membrane of the bacteria. Two notable
receptors have been characterized; the TAR receptor,
which detects aspartate secreted by cancerous tissues
and the TRG receptor, which aids in migration towards
ribose found in necrotic tissues [21]. Further manipulation
of this ability to chemotax towards tumors may lead to
the development of bacteria that are directed toward
specific regions within tumors. Towards this end, it was
discovered that the aspartate receptor controls migration
towards tumors, the serine receptor initiates penetration,
and the ribose/galactose receptor directs Salmonella into
necrotic regions [21]. Therefore knocking out a particular
receptor may help direct Salmonella to particular region
within the tumor. Other alterations, such as truncation of
lipid A [23], reduces the immunogenicity of the bacteria,
which in turn, reduces the risk of an adverse inflammatory
reaction and possible toxic shock.

Exploiting
Salmonella
Typhimurium tumor targeting
S. Typhimurium, once at the tumor site, is thought
to help destroy tumors through competition for nutrients
and innate toxicity as a result of damage due to growth
of the bacteria and production of toxins. Presently, S.
Typhimurium is being used to target and destroy tumors in
three specific ways: i) delivery of anti cancer compounds,
ii) sensitizing the immune system to the presence of
tumors, and iii) using bacterial toxins to directly activate
caspase-3, a key enzyme of the apoptotic pathway (Figure
1).

cancer
The ignorance of the immune system to the presence
of tumors within the body is a significant consideration
in attempting to treat cancer. While numerous methods
have been attempted to alert the immune system to the
presence of tumors, recent work has shed new light on the
role that Salmonella, in particular, plays in this process.
S. Typhimurium infection of cancer cells was shown to
upregulate the cellular protein connexin43, resulting in
gap junction formation not only between tumor cells but
also between cancer cells and antigen presenting cells
(APCs) [34]. This allows APCs access to pre-processed
tumor antigens, which they can then present to T-cells,

Bacteria have been recently described as “tiny
programmable robot factories” for use in cancer therapy
[25]. Indeed, there are numerous compounds that can
be delivered via bacteria to a tumor site including
cytotoxic agents, green fluorescent protein for targeting
and visualization of tumors, DNA for gene therapy, and
small interfering RNAs (siRNA) to target expression of
key proteins within tumors [11,22,26,27,28,29,30,31].
While these techniques have had varying levels of success
in animal models, it is inferred that these practices when

sensitizing the immune system to the presence of tumors
and activating an anti-tumor response. This ability to
sensitize the immune system to the presence of tumors
may explain some of the success Salmonella has in
combating tumors. Alternative methods of sensitizing the
immune system through Salmonella targeting of tumors
have also been used.
Other approaches employ S. Typhimurium to deliver
cytokines to the tumor site in an attempt to activate
immune cells or elicit an immune response against the
tumor [8,10,35,36,37,38,39]. Antigens have also been
linked to bacterial toxins that are highly immunogenic to
sensitize the immune system against cancer cell antigens
[10,40]. Again, this approach harnesses the ability of S.
Typhimurium to deliver immune sensitizing compounds
at the tumor site to alert circulating immune cells, while
at the same time the bacteria target the more difficult to
reach anoxic regions of the tumor.

offer novel opportunities to utilize the innate bacterial
toxicity. In particular, S. Typhimurium may perhaps be
engineered to up-regulate caspase-3 through effector
expression while at the same time introducing potent anticancer drugs that can no longer be successfully expelled
by the tumor.

Future
directions
for
Salmonella cancer therapy
In sum, bacterial cancer therapy has made great strides
in past decade, and is now considered a tangible option for
future cancer therapy. The potential for bacterial therapy
seems endless but some fundamental issues need to be
reconciled before this kind of therapy moves into a clinic
setting. Insufficient colonization of tumors appears to be
the major obstacle identified in clinical trials, a problem
that was not evident in animal models. Overcoming
this challenge is one of the priorities in developing
bacteria as cancer therapy agents. But the ease of genetic
manipulation in S. Typhimurium may prove to be the key
in surmounting this hurdle. Toxicity of S. Typhimurium
is also problematic, with the bacteria too attenuated to
destroy tumors once at the tumor site due to toxin removal,
or poor expression of anti-cancer compounds, or the risks
of toxicity are too great for injection of S. Typhimurium
into severely immunocompromised patients. Overcoming
these limitations, particularly with respect to using
bacterial proteins in therapy, are key to moving this aspect
of bacterial cancer therapy forward.

Using bacterial toxins to directly activate
caspase-3:
It is becoming increasingly evident that the ability
to control or inhibit apoptosis affords a distinct advantage
to certain bacterial pathogens, as it allows the organism
to replicate within the infected cell, increasing the chance
of a successful infection. Although a number of bacteria
specifically inhibit apoptosis, our recent evidence indicates
that S. Typhimurium may activate specific apoptotic
enzymes [41]. We found that activation of caspase-3 by
a single effector protein of S. Typhimurium increases
the infectivity of this pathogen, as caspase-3 directed
the processing of S. Typhimurium secreted effectors into
their functional subunits upon their delivery into the host
cell [42]. Such an unprecedented means of promoting
infection indicates that the interaction of bacteria with
apoptotic pathways may be more intimate than previously
recognized, and in fact, may be quite common amongst
pathogens.
This observation raises a key question with regards
to S. Typhimurium therapy for cancer - can we use
bacteria to exploit apoptotic pathways, and in particular
activation of caspase-3, opening a new front in the fight
against cancer? Direct activation of caspase-3 in the
treatment of cancer through using procaspase-3 activating
compounds has been attempted previously using pan
activating caspase-1 (PAC-1) [43]. Thus, employing
an efficient bacterial vector to directly deliver a native
bacterial effector for caspase-3 activation offers a different
approach to bacterial therapy. Rather than deliver large
quantities of non native proteins, it may be possible to
channel the built-in toxicity of S. Typhimurium to destroy
tumors. S. Typhimurium also harbors several promoters
that are induced under hypoxic conditions, and using these
promoters to control expression of specific effectors may
