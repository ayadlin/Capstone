and Systemic Inoculation of Histidine-Rich and pH-Dependent
Host Defense–like Lytic Peptides

Abstract
Previously, we reported that intratumor or systemic inoculation of a cationic 15-mer, innate immunity-like lytic peptide
composed of D- and L-amino acids ([D]-K6L9) caused growth
arrest of 22RV1 prostate carcinoma xenografts in a mouse
model. However, despite its therapeutic potential, this peptide
has significant systemic toxicity at concentrations slightly
higher than the therapeutic one. Here, we used the acidic
environment created by solid tumors as a trigger to activate
anticancer lytic peptides by making them cationic only at low
pH levels. We achieved this selectivity by substituting lysines
(pKa, f10.5) for histidines (pKa, f6.1) in the parental
peptide [D]-K6L9. Histidine is protonated below pH 7. For that
purpose, we replaced either three or all six lysines in the
parental peptide with histidines to obtain the peptides [D]K3H3L9 and [D]-H6L9. Interestingly, in vitro experiments
showed pH-dependent activity only with [D]-H6L9 mainly
toward cancer cell lines. However, both peptides showed
reduced systemic toxicity compared with the parental
peptide. Intratumor and systemic inoculation of these
peptides resulted in a significant decrease in the 22RV1
prostate cancer tumor volume and systemic secretion of
prostate-specific antigen in a xenograft mice model. Moreover, histologic modifications revealed a significant reduction
in new blood vessels selectively in tumor tissues after
treatment with the peptides compared with the untreated
tumors. The lytic mode of action of these new peptides, which
makes it difficult for the cancer cells to develop resistance,
and their selective and pH-dependent activity make them
potential candidates for treatment of solid cancer tumors.

Introduction
The development of an effective therapy for malignant diseases
has been hindered by the lack of consistent differences between
tumors and normal tissue. Thus, unlike antibiotic treatment of
bacteria, it has been difficult to develop therapeutic strategies that
have major anticancerous effects without having significant
cytotoxicity. One major difference between many solid tumors
and the surrounding normal tissue is the nutritional and metabolic

environment (1, 2). The functional vasculature of tumors is often
inadequate to supply the oxygen demands and nutritional needs of
the rapidly proliferating population of cancerous cells. This in turn
contributes to the development of anaerobic conditions, under
which hydrolysis of ATP results in the production of lactic acid.
Moreover, a poor and chaotic tumor vascularization leads to the
inefficient washout of the acidic products and further contributes
to the development of a chronically acidic extracellular environment (2, 3). The consequence of that phenomenon is that the pH of
the extracellular space surrounding solid tumors is significantly
lower than the pH of the surrounding normal tissues (1, 3–6).
Therefore, in recent years, several attempts have been made to use
the solid tumor acidity to develop new pH-dependent approaches
to cancer therapy (7–10) or drug delivery (11–14) because this
venue seems most promising.
A recent approach under study for cancer treatment is the use of
cationic antimicrobial peptides (15–19). These peptides, which
have significantly higher toxicity to bacteria than to normal
mammalian cells, were shown to exhibit a broad spectrum of
cytotoxic activity against cancer cells as well (17, 20, 21). In
line with this, we reported that intratumor and systemic
administration of a short 15-mer D,L-amino acid peptide ([D]K6L9; LKLLKKLLKKLLKLL-NH2, the underlined letters are D-amino
acid) specifically inhibited the growth of primary human prostate
carcinomas. The electrostatic attractions between the negatively
charged components of the membrane of cancer cells and the
positively charged peptide are believed to play a major role in the
strong binding of the peptide and its ability to selectively disrupt
the membrane of cancer cells (22, 23). However, similar to other
membranolytic peptides, higher concentrations of this peptide
could damage normal cells and therefore narrow the therapeutic
index.
Here, we show the use of the acidic microenvironment created
by solid tumors as a trigger to activate anticancer lytic peptides
that otherwise are not active under physiologic conditions. For that
purpose, we used [D]-K6L9 (22, 23) as a template and substituted
either three lysines (pKa, f10.5) or all of them for histidines (pKa,
f6.1), a change that should make the peptides positively charged
and active primarily at acidic pH values.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The CL1 human prostate carcinoma cell line used is an
androgen-independent subclone of LNCaP, which was generated by
culturing adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells in charcoal-stripped serum, as
previously described (24). The 22RV1 human prostate carcinoma cells are
an androgen-independent subclone of the adenocarcinoma prostatic
adenocarcinoma CWR22 xenograft (25). The CL1 and 22RV1 [American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS (Biological Industries) and antibiotics. NIH 3T3 mouse
fibroblast cell lines (ATCC) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10%

Tumor Elimination by a Host Defense–like Lytic Peptide
fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and antibiotics (Biological Industries). Similarly, OL human foreskin fibroblasts (ATCC; a generous gift from
Prof. Menachem Rubinstein, Department of Molecular Genetics, The
Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) and murine Lewis lung
carcinoma (LLC) cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, L-glutamine, and antibiotics.
Peptide synthesis and purification. Peptides were synthesized by a
9-fluorenylmethoxylcarbonyl solid-phase method on Rink amide MBHA
resin (Calbiochem-novabiochem) by using an ABI 433A automatic peptide
synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) followed by peptide cleavage from the
resin and purification by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (>98%). The composition of the peptides was confirmed by
electrospray mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis.
In vitro cytotoxicity assays. Aliquots of medium containing 1  104
cells (malignant: CL1, 22RV1, and LLC; nonmalignant: NIH 3T3 and OL)
were distributed into a 96-well plate (BD Falcon). The following day, the
media were replaced with 90 AL fresh culture medium adjusted to pH 7.4 or
5.5 and 10 AL of a solution buffer (adjusted to pH 7.4 or 5.5, respectively)
containing different concentrations of the peptides. The plate was then
incubated for 24 h before adding to each well 50 AL of 2,3-bis[2-4-nitro-5sulfophenyl]-2H -tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) reaction
solution (Biological Industries). Viability was determined as described
previously (22, 23). The LC50 (the concentration at which 50% of the cells
die) for each peptide was obtained from the dose-dependent cell viability
curves.
Membrane permeability studies. Vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and
cholesterol (4.35/4.35/1/0.3/1, w/w) and entrapped with calcein [60 mmol/L
calcein, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.4)] were generated
by using the extrusion method as described before (22). Peptides were then
added to vesicle suspension (2 mL, 2.4 Amol/L liposomes) adjusted to pH 6
or 7.4. Peptide-induced calcein leakage resulted in an increase in
fluorescence (k ex = 485 nm; k em = 515 nm; ref. 26), which was monitored.
Sytox Green uptake assay. Aliquots of medium containing 1  104 CL1
cells were distributed into a 96-well plate. The following day, the media were
replaced with 90 AL fresh culture medium adjusted to pH 7.4 or 5.5 and
10 AL of a solution buffer (adjusted to pH 7.4 or 5.5, respectively) containing
different concentrations of the peptides. Then, 100 AL Sytox Green
(Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 1 Amol/L. After
15 min, the cells were examined with a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse,
Nikon) applied to a digital camera (C4742-95; Hamamatsu). Excitation was
set at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm.
Acute toxicity. Acute toxicity was examined after i.v. injection of the
peptides to five male ICR mice (Harlen Co.). Each mouse was injected with a
0.5-mL solution of freshly prepared peptide in Hartmann’s lactate solution
(Teva Medical). The doses of peptides administered per mouse were 8, 15,
20, 25, and 30 mg/kg of body weight. Animals were directly inspected for
adverse effects for 4 h, and mortality was monitored for 6 d.
Inhibition of tumor growth in human prostate carcinoma
xenografts. The s.c. implantation of human prostate carcinoma in mice
was done as described previously (27). Briefly, 0.1 mL of androgenindependent 22RV1 human prostate carcinoma cells (5  106) in Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) was inoculated s.c. into the dorsal side of 5- to 6-wk-old
nude male mice with an average weight of 20 to 25 g (Harlen). One week
after cell implantation, when the tumor diameter reached f5 mm (we
defined this day as day 0), all the peptides or vehicles (Hartmann’s lactate
solution; pH 6.5) were injected intratumorally (at 1 mg/kg; 100 AL) or
systemically (at 9 mg/kg; 500 AL). This treatment was carried out three
times a week (every second day) for a total of nine doses (n = 10 mice per
group). Tumor size was measured by a caliper and recorded twice a week.
At the end of the treatment, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were
removed, photographed, and weighed.
Serum prostate-specific antigen levels. At the end of the treatment,
blood samples were collected to heparin-containing tubes and centrifuged,
and the supernatants were stored at 20jC. The CanAg prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) EIA kit (CanAg Diagnostic) was used to determine total
PSA in the mice plasma (27). Tumor size and PSA levels, represented as

mean F SE, were analyzed by Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.
Histologic and immunofluorescent staining. Excised tumors were
fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded 5-Am sections were
stained with H&E and examined using a microscope (Eclipse E800M, Nikon)
with a digital camera (DXM1200, Nikon). For immunofluorescent staining,
the tumors were fixed with 4% buffered formaldehyde for CD34 epitope
labeling (new blood vessels) or zinc fixative perfusion for CD31 epitope
labeling (old blood vessels). Paraffin-embedded 5-Am tumor sections were
overlaid with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (Pharmingen) or rat antimouse CD34 antibody (Cedarlane) against blood vessels. Sections were
incubated with bridging biotinylated rabbit anti-rat antibodies (Vector
Laboratories) and visualized with streptavidin-conjugated FITC (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For quantitative analysis, capillaries,
identified by positive staining for CD34 and CD31, were counted and their
density was expressed as the percentage of capillaries of the total section
area using Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software. To quantify the vessels, 10
nonnecrotic areas at 100 Am2 per field at 200 were captured using an
Olympus BX-40 microscope (Olympus).

Results
In vitro activity of the peptides toward malignant and
normal cells at acidic and physiologic pHs. Using the template
of [D]-K6L9 (22, 23), we synthesized two histidine-containing
peptides: [D]-K3H3L9 and [D]-H6L9 (Table 1). The LC50 values of the
peptides shown in Table 2 reveal that only [D]-H6L9 has pHdependent activity. However, all three peptides showed selective
activity toward cancer cells (Table 2). Note that the histidinecontaining peptides are less active than the parental peptide [D]K6L9. Nevertheless, the amount administrated to mice is similar to
that reported previously for [D]-K6L9.
Membrane disruption induced by the peptides. Peptides, at
increasing concentrations, were added to a suspension of vesicles
(lipid composition of cancer cells; refs. 28, 29) encapsulating calcein
(2.5 Amol/L phospholipids) at pH 7.4 or 6. Membrane permeability
was measured by monitoring the fluorescence recovery. The level
of maximum leakage reached, as a function of the peptide-to-lipid
molar ratio, is shown in Fig. 1A. [D]-K6L9 and [D]-K3H3L9 permeate
vesicles at both pHs, whereas [D]-H6L9 was highly active only
at pH 6.
pH-dependent permeation of the cancer cell membrane.
Sytox Green can penetrate into cells when their membrane is
disrupted and its fluorescence increases drastically when bound to
intracellular nucleic acids. Our data reveal that at a concentration
of 3.1 Amol/L (LC50 value), [D]-H6L9 induced an influx of Sytox

according to regulations approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
In vivo acute systemic toxicity. Acute systemic toxicity was
observed after a single i.v. injection of [D]-K6L9 at concentrations
above 8 mg/kg (n = 5 mice). In contrast, both [D]-K3H3L9 and
[D]-H6L9 did not indicate any acute systemic toxicity at doses of
up to 30 and 20 mg/kg, respectively (n = 5 mice for each group;
Table 1).
Inhibition of solid prostate cancer growth by intratumor
administration of the peptides. 22RV1 cells were implanted s.c.
in mice. One week after tumor implantation, [D]-H6L9 and [D]K3H3L9 were injected intratumorally at a dose of 1 mg/kg (Fig. 2). A
significant inhibition in tumor growth volume was observed during
the course of the experiment in mice that were treated with the
peptides (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, a significant
reduction (81%) in dissected tumor weight was measured on the
last day of the experiment (Fig. 2A and B). The fact that these
tumors were not completely eradicated can be explained in a
variety of mechanisms, such as relatively fast clearance of the
peptides from the tumor site and difficulties to diffuse through the
necrotic area. Histologic examination of dissected tumor sections
stained with H&E (Fig. 2C) revealed that the peptides inhibited the
growth of the prostate carcinoma cells: in the control xenograft, the
dissected tumor contained large numbers of dense, highly
proliferative cancer cells. In contrast, in mice treated with any of
the peptides, the number of tumor cells was reduced dramatically.
Moreover, connective tissue replaced the cancer cells in and
around the peptide-treated tumors. Other typical phenomena
observed in the treated tumors were hematomas and proteinaceous liquids within the tissue. Immunohistochemistry of newly
formed microvessel tube densities (CD34 staining) within and
around the cancerous tissue revealed that the untreated tumor
contained a branched net of newly formed capillary tubes, whereas
the treated tumors barely contained newly formed capillary tubes
inside the tumors (Fig. 2D). However, the newly formed capillary
tubes in the adjacent connective tissue were not damaged from the
treatment.

(Supplementary Figs. S2A and S3A). In addition, a significant
reduction (75% and 72% for [D]-K3H3L9 and [D]-H6L9, respectively)
in dissected tumor weight was measured on the last day of the
experiment (Figs. 3 and 4A and B). The reduction in tumor size was
accompanied by a marked reduction in 22RV1-secreted PSA levels
compared with the control group (Supplementary Figs. S2B and

with H&E and CD34 (Figs. 3 and 4C and D, respectively) revealed

capillary tubes revealed no significant difference in the densities of
these capillary tubes in treated and untreated tumors (data not
shown).

Discussion
The important findings in this study are the following: (a) the
histidine-containing peptides have significantly reduced systemic
toxicity and (b) the entirely substituted histidine peptide has pHdependent activity. The peptide damaged membranes and cells
only at acidic pH (Table 2; Fig. 1). We have shown previously that
the selective activity of the parental peptide [D]-K6L6 toward
cancer cells results predominantly from differences between the
membranes of malignant and normal cells (23). Whereas normal
cells have mainly zwitterionic membranes on their outer leaflet
(30), cancer cells express approximately 3% to 9% more of
the acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, in their outer leaflet
(31–33). These cells also contain a higher density of negatively

www.aacrjournals.org

charged O-glycosylated mucins compared with normal cells
(34, 35). Thus, electrostatic interactions between cationic peptides
and the anionic cell membrane components are believed to be a
major factor in the selective killing of cancer cells by these peptides.
Because the histidines in [D]-H6L6 are protonated at acidic pHs, the
peptide is not active at physiologic neutral pHs. Indeed, [D]-H6L6 is
the only peptide that could not permeate model membranes and
cancer cells at physiologic pH (Fig. 1). Interestingly, [D]-K3H3L9 has
no pH-dependent activity, although it contains a significant number
of histidines. This differs from several natural antimicrobial
peptides that have pH-dependent activity, although they contain
only a few histidines in their sequence (36–47).
The membranolytic activity of the peptides toward model
membranes (Fig. 1A) and cell membranes (Fig. 2) supports our
assumption that the histidine-containing peptides kill cancer cells
by disrupting the cell membrane similarly to [D]-K6L6 and other
antimicrobial peptides (20, 22, 23, 29). Importantly, substituting
lysines for histidines significantly reduced the systemic acute

toxicity of the peptides (Table 1). Furthermore, topical and
systemic administration of these two peptides significantly
inhibited 22RV1 prostate carcinoma tumor xenograft growth and
lowered the level of PSA known to be secreted by 22RV1 xenografts
(25). Note that [D]-K3H3L9 was less cytotoxic than [D]-H6L9. This
might be due to the relatively elevated toxicity of the latter in acidic
organs besides the tumor.
Previous studies have reported on the use of various techniques
to activate anticancer drugs in the presence of the low pH.
However, the majority of these techniques focused on drug delivery
systems that are pH dependent. Examples include the controlled,
pH-dependent release of chemotherapy agents from polymers
(12–14) and liposomes (48) as well as by using cell-penetrating
peptides (11, 49). Here, [D]-H6L6 possesses three functions:
targeting, activation at low pHs, and cytotoxic activity. We expect
that owing to the strong membranolytic effect of the peptides, it
would be difficult for the tumor cell to select resistant variants.
This is similar to what has been found in many cases with bacteria
treated with cationic innate immunity lytic peptides (15, 50).
In addition to the potent inhibition of tumor growth by [D]-H6L6
and [D]-K6H6L3, the histology of the tumors treated both

intratumorally and via systemic inoculation revealed a significant
decrease in vascularization of new capillary tubes compared with
untreated mice (Figs. 2D, 3D, and 4D). This could be the result of
either the reduced cancer cell density or the direct activity of the
peptides toward the sensitive new capillary tubes. The latter is
supported by the recent finding that endothelial cells forming the
branched vasculature supporting solid tumors express enhanced
amount of phosphatidylserine molecules on the outer leaflet of
their plasma membrane (51, 52). Treatment of the tumors with the
peptides was also accompanied by a reduction in the density of
cancer cells and an increase in the amount of newly formed
connective tissue within the tumor. This phenomenon correlates
with an increased number of cells containing necrotic debris,
comprehensive hematomas, and pertinacious liquid found within
the cancerous tissue after treatment. Taken together, these results
suggest that the observed reduction in the tumor size is only an
underestimation of the combined destructive effect of the peptides
on the tumor tissue and cells.
In summary, the histidine-rich peptides offer a new class of
membranolytic agents for efficient anticancer treatment with

[D]-H6L6 may provide a new strategy for treatment of solid tumors
within naturally occurring low-pH extracellular environments.
