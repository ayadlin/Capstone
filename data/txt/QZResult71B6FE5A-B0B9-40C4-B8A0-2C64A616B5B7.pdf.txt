Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection results in chronic gastritis, which
may progress to gastric cancer. In this study, we investigated
the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in preventing the
progression of gastritis to gastric cancer in H. pylori–infected
transgenic INS-GAS mice. H. pylori infection induced severe
dysplasia and gastric cancer classified as high-grade and lowgrade gastrointestinal intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN) in INSGAS mice at 28 weeks postinfection (WPI). H. pylori
eradication therapy using omeprazole, metronidazole, and
clarithromycin was administered p.o. at 8, 12, or 22 WPI.
Compared with untreated infected mice, H. pylori eradication
at 8, 12, and 22 WPI significantly reduced the severity of
dysplasia (P < 0.01). Moreover, H. pylori eradication at 8 WPI
completely prevented the development of GIN (P < 0.001).
Although not as effective as early antimicrobial treatment,
prevention of progression to high-grade GIN was achieved by
H. pylori eradication at 12 and 22 WPI (P < 0.05). Consistent
with reduced gastric pathology, H. pylori eradication at all
time points significantly down-regulated gastric Interferon-;,
tumor necrosis factor-A, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and
Reg 1 mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and reduced epithelial proliferation in the corpus (P < 0.01) compared with untreated
infected mice. We concluded that H. pylori eradication
prevented gastric cancer to the greatest extent when antibiotics
are given at an early point of infection, but that eradication
therapy given at a later time point delayed the development
of severe dysplastic lesions. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3540–8]

Introduction
Helicobacter pylori was first identified in the antrum of patients
with active chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers (1). H. pylori is now
recognized as the major cause of gastric cancer and has been
classified as a group I carcinogen by WHO (2, 3). H. pylori infection
causes persistent chronic gastritis, which in susceptible individuals
may progress to atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and
finally, intestinal-type gastric cancer (3, 4). Therefore, H. pylori
eradication should, in theory, prevent the development of H.
pylori–associated gastric diseases. Eradication of H. pylori in
humans has been associated with prevention or regression of
preneoplastic lesions including atrophic gastritis and intestinal
metaplasia (5–9). The effectiveness of H. pylori eradication in

preventing the development of gastric cancer remains controversial. Antibiotic treatment during knee or hip replacement surgery
reduced the incidence of gastric cancer in these patients during the
postoperative period, probably due to eradication of H. pylori
(10, 11). The optimal effect of antibiotic eradication therapy in
preventing gastric cancer has been observed in H. pylori–infected
patients who did not have precancerous gastric lesions before
H. pylori eradication therapy (12). However, in other studies,
H. pylori eradication did not reduce the overall prevalence of
dysplasia or gastric cancer (6, 9, 12, 13). Because it typically requires
several decades for gastric cancer to develop in susceptible hosts
acquiring H. pylori infection at an early age (4), H. pylori eradication
trials continue to raise key questions about which patients would
benefit from H. pylori eradication and at what stage of gastric
disease would H. pylori antimicrobial eradication prevent the
progression to gastric cancer.
Several animal models have been used to examine whether
H. pylori eradication is effective in the reversal of preneoplastic
gastric lesions and in preventing the progression of these preneoplastic lesions to gastric cancer. Antibiotic eradication therapy
reversed the histologic progression of dysplasia in H. pylori–
infected Mongolian gerbils (14). In Helicobacter felis–infected
C57BL/6 mice that developed gastric cancer within 16 months
postinfection, gastric cancer was completely prevented by H. felis
antimicrobial eradication therapy given within the first 6 months of
infection. In contrast, antibiotics given to H. felis–infected mice at
12 months postinfection did not arrest progression of dysplasia but
reduced the incidence of invasive gastric cancer (15).
Recent studies suggest an association between hypergastrinemia, Helicobacter infection, and gastric cancer in humans and
mice (16–19). In the absence of Helicobacter infection, transgenic
INS-GAS mice that overexpress amidated gastrin have elevated
gastric acid secretion and an increased parietal cell number at 1 to
3 months of age. With increasing age, these INS-GAS mice lose
parietal cell mass and develop hypochlorhydria, gastric atrophy,
metaplasia, and dysplasia. At 20 months of age, INS-GAS mice
spontaneously develop invasive gastric cancer (18, 20). The
development of gastric cancer is accelerated by gastric Helicobacter spp. infection, and lesion severity is more profound in male
INS-GAS mice (16, 18, 19, 21). The purpose of this study was to
examine the effect of H. pylori eradication at different stages of
progression from gastritis to gastric cancer in INS-GAS male mice.

Laboratory Animal Care International and housed on hard wood bedding in
microisolator, solid-bottomed polycarbonate cages, and given a commercial
rodent diet (Prolab RMH 3000, PMI Nutrition International) and water
ad libitum.
Experimental design. Fifty-four 6- to 8-wk-old male mice were infected
by oral gavage with 0.2 mL of H. pylori SS1 on alternate days for a total of
three doses (22, 23). The H. pylori inoculum for oral gavage was adjusted
with PBS to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm (approximate dose of 109
colony-forming units/mL; ref. 23). Helicobacter-uninfected mice were sham
dosed with 0.2 mL of PBS. Infected mice were dosed p.o. with omeprazole
(400 Amol/kg/d; Sigma-Aldrich), metronidazole (14.2 mg/kg/d; SigmaAldrich), and clarithromycin (7.15 mg/kg/d; gift from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.) in a 0.2-mL volume twice a day for 7 d (24). This antimicrobial
regimen previously showed 100% eradication of H. pylori in infected C57BL/
6 mice (24). Treatment was administered at 8, 12, or 22 weeks post H. pylori
infection (WPI). Mice were euthanized at 28 WPI.
Tissue collection and histologic analysis. Following CO2 asphyxiation,
blood was immediately collected by cardiac puncture. The stomach and
proximal duodenum were removed and the stomach incised along the
greater curvature. Linear gastric strips from the lesser curvature were fixed
overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded, cut to 4-Am
thickness, and stained with H&E. Tissue sections were scored for gastric
lesions using previously published criteria by veterinary pathologists (B.R
and A.B.R) blinded to sample identity (25). A dysplasia score of 3.0 was
considered carcinoma in situ or low-grade gastrointestinal intraepithelial
neoplasia (GIN). In addition, dysplasia scores z3.5 represented intramucosal carcinoma or herniated, high-grade GIN (26). Both low-grade and
high-grade GIN in mouse stomachs were diagnosed as gastric cancer. Ki67
immunostaining (BD Biosciences) was used to measure epithelial
proliferation of gastric mucosa. The ratio of Ki67-positive to total epithelial
nuclei in glands occupying the full length of the proximal corpus was
quantified manually for the Ki67 labeling index (LI), and results were
averaged from three to four mice in each group. The remainder of the
gastric tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70jC for
DNA and RNA analyses.
Confirmation of H. pylori eradication by quantitative PCR. A
longitudinal strip of gastric tissue from the greater curvature was digested
with proteinase K at 55jC overnight, followed by DNA extraction with
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitation. H.
pylori colonization levels in gastric tissue were quantified by a fluorogenic
quantitative PCR assay with urease B primers (27). The genomic copies of H.
pylori were normalized to microgram of murine genomic DNA as
determined by quantitative PCR with a eukaryotic 18S endogenous control
(User Bulletin #2, Applied Biosystems). Any sample detecting <10 copies of
the H. pylori genome was considered negative for H. pylori colonization.
Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression. A longitudinal strip of
gastric tissue from the anterior wall was harvested and snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
cDNA was synthesized from 5 Ag of total RNA with High Capacity
cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). IFN-c and tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) mRNA levels were quantified with SYBR Green PCR reagent
(Qiagen) using primers for IFN-c [CATGGCTGTTTCTGGCTGTTACTG (F)
and GTTGCTGATGGCCTGATTGTCTTT (R), annealing at 56jC] and TNF-a
[CATCTTCTCAAAATTCGAGTGACAA (F) and TGGGAGTAGACAAGGTACAACCC (R), annealing at 60jC]. The final concentration of each primer
was 0.3 Amol/L. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; Applied Biosystems,
Mm00440485_m1), regenerating gene 1 (Reg 1; Applied Biosystems,
Mm00485651_m1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; Applied Biosystems) mRNA levels were quantified with TaqMan
gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI Prism Sequence
Detection System 7700. mRNA levels of each cytokine were normalized to
the mRNA level of internal control GAPDH and compared with the data of
uninfected mice using the DDC T method (User Bulletin #2, Applied
Biosystems).

evaluated for H. pylori–specific, Th2-associated IgG1 and Th1-associated
IgG2a by ELISA using an outer membrane protein preparation from H.

pylori (SS1 strain) as previously described (28). In brief, 96-well flatbottomed plates were coated with 100 AL of antigen (10 Ag/mL) overnight
at 4jC; sera were diluted to a ratio of 1:100 and added to the wells.
Biotinylated secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies, clones A85-1 and 5.7
(BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA), were used for detecting IgG1 and IgG2a,
respectively. Incubation with extravidin peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was
followed by treatment with 2,2¶-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)
substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for color development. The
absorbance was recorded at A 405 and A 595 with a plate reader per
manufacturer’s protocol (Power WaveX Select, Bio-Tek Instruments).
Statistical analysis. Gastric lesion scores and Ki67 LI for proliferation
indices were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test. Expression levels of
cytokines, iNOS, Reg 1, and IgG titers were compared using Student’s t test.
Incidences of low-grade and high-grade GIN in the treatment groups were
compared with controls by Fisher’s exact t test. Statistical analysis was done
using a commercial software (GraphPad Prism 4.0, GraphPad Software, Inc.)
with significance at P < 0.05.

Results
Confirmation of H. pylori eradication in INS-GAS mice that
received antimicrobial therapy. To assess the effect of H. pylori
eradication on progression of gastric cancer in INS-GAS mice,
antimicrobial therapy using the combination of omeprazole,
metronidazole, and clazithromycin was administered p.o. to mice
at 8, 12, or 22 WPI. Quantitative PCR indicated that H. pylori was
successfully eradicated in all mice (100%) treated at 8 or 12 weeks
postinfection (WPI). In 12 of 14 (85.7%) animals treated at 22 WPI,
H. pylori was successfully eradicated (Fig. 1). Only mice in which H.
pylori eradication was successful were used for further analysis.
H. pylori infection promoted the development of premalignant lesions and gastric cancer in INS-GAS mice. Helicobacter
infection promotes gastric carcinogenesis in INS-GAS mice,
particularly in males (18, 19). As previously noted (19), uninfected
INS-GAS mice at 28 to 34 weeks of age developed progressive
gastric lesions including atrophy, epithelial defects, and dysplasia,
accompanied with minimal inflammation, severe hyperplasia, and
intestinal metaplasia (Fig. 1; Table 1). Corpus hypertrophy was
observed at necropsy as thickened mucosal folds in H. pylori–
infected INS-GAS mice at 22 and 28 WPI. H. pylori–infected INSGAS mice developed chronic atrophic gastritis with profound
changes in mucosal architecture, restricted mainly to the corpus
and characterized by loss of parietal and chief cells (Fig. 1).
Compared with age-matched uninfected mice, infected INS-GAS
mice had more severe inflammation (P < 0.001), oxyntic atrophy
(P < 0.05), hyperplasia (P < 0.05), epithelial defects (P < 0.001),
intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.05), and dysplasia (P < 0.001) at 22 WPI,
and higher degrees of inflammation (P < 0.001), dysplasia
(P < 0.001), and hyperplasia (P < 0.01) at 28 WPI (Fig. 2; Table 1).
Compared with infected mice at 22 WPI, infected mice at 28 WPI
had more severe dysplasia and atrophy (P < 0.05).
H. pylori eradication at 8 WPI significantly reduced gastritis
and premalignant lesions. H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice
received antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8, 12, or 22 WPI
and were euthanized at 28 WPI. Infected mice that received H.
pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8 WPI had gastric
architecture indistinguishable from that of uninfected age-matched
mice (Fig. 1). Compared with untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS
mice, H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8 WPI inhibited
the development of corpus dysplasia, inflammation, atrophy,
hyperplasia, epithelial defects (all P < 0.001), and intestinal
metaplasia (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). Additionally, these mice exhibited
less severe corpus inflammation, atrophy, and epithelial defects

than did the uninfected mice (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01,
respectively; Fig. 2A).
Microscopically, H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice that received
H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy at 12 WPI and were
euthanized 16 weeks later had distorted mucosal architecture with
dilated glands and glandular dysplasia (Fig. 1). Compared with
untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice, infected INS-GAS mice
that received H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy at 12 WPI
had statistically less severe dysplasia, inflammation, and intestinal
metaplasia (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively), but both
groups had similar degrees of atrophy, hyperplasia, and epithelial
defects (Fig. 2A). Compared with uninfected mice, infected INSGAS mice that received H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy
at 12 WPI had more severe dysplasia and inflammation (P < 0.001)
but comparable atrophy, hyperplasia, epithelial defects, and
intestinal metaplasia.
H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice that received H. pylori
antimicrobial eradication at 22 WPI and were euthanized 6 weeks

later had thickened mucosal folds and developed corpus hyperplasia and dysplasia (Fig. 1). Microscopically, these mice developed
statistically less severe dysplasia, inflammation, atrophy, and
epithelial defects compared with untreated H. pylori–infected
INS-GAS mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 2 A). Compared with uninfected mice,
infected INS-GAS mice that received H. pylori antimicrobial
eradication therapy at 22 WPI had more severe dysplasia,
hyperplasia, and epithelial defects (P < 0.05). Additionally, it is
important to note that the two mice in which H. pylori was not
eradicated developed low-grade or high-grade GIN (data not
shown).
Among the infected INS-GAS mice that received H. pylori
antimicrobial eradication therapy, mice receiving antimicrobial
therapy at 8 WPI had significantly lower scores of dysplasia,
inflammation, atrophy, and hyperplasia compared with mice
receiving antimicrobial therapy at 12 or 22 WPI (P V 0.05), and
had less severe epithelial defects compared with mice receiving
antimicrobial therapy at 12 WPI (P < 0.001). Most gastric lesions

were comparable in infected mice that received eradication therapy
at 12 or 22 WPI, except for epithelial defects that were more severe
in the 12 WPI group (P < 0.01).
H. pylori eradication at 8 WPI prevented progression to
low-grade and high-grade gastrointestinal intraepithelial
neoplasia. None of the uninfected INS-GAS mice between 34 to
36 weeks of age developed GIN. In contrast, all untreated H.
pylori–infected INS-GAS mice (n = 10) at 28 WPI (34–36 weeks
old) developed gastric cancer: 2 (20%) with low-grade GIN and
8 (80%) with high-grade GIN (Fig. 2B). In the H. pylori–infected
mice that received antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8 WPI
(n = 11), 10 (91%) of them did not have GIN and 1 (9%) had lowgrade GIN. In the infected mice that received antimicrobial
eradication therapy at 12 WPI (n = 9), 1 (11%) did not have GIN,
7 (78%) had low-grade GIN, and 1 (11%) had high-grade GIN. Six
of the 12 (50%) infected mice that received antimicrobial

eradication therapy at 22 WPI did not have GIN, and the
remainder (50%) had low-grade GIN.
Compared with uninfected mice, H. pylori–infected mice that
received antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8 WPI had a similar
incidence of GIN (P = 0.38). In contrast, infected mice that received
antimicrobial eradication therapy at 12 or 22 WPI and untreated H.
pylori–infected mice had a higher incidence of low-grade and highgrade GIN (P < 0.05) when compared with uninfected mice.
Compared with H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice that did not
receive eradication therapy, the incidences of low-grade and highgrade GIN were statistically lower in infected mice receiving
antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8, 12, or 22 WPI (P V 0.05).
Among the infected mice receiving antimicrobial eradication
therapy, therapy at 8 WPI resulted in the lowest incidences of
GIN compared with eradication therapy at 12 or 22 WPI (P < 0.05).

8 WPI had statistically lower IFN-c,TNF-a, and iNOS mRNA levels compared
with uninfected mice and infected mice without eradication therapy. H. pylori

similar between infected mice receiving eradication therapy at 12
and 22 WPI (P = 0.12).
Antimicrobial eradication therapy was associated with
decreased gastric IFN-g, TNF-a, and iNOS mRNA levels
compared with untreated infected mice. Given the importance
of the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of H. pylori
gastritis, we analyzed selected proinflammatory cytokines and
iNOS mRNA levels in the gastric tissue at 28 WPI. Compared with
uninfected mice, gastric IFN-c mRNA levels were up-regulated in
untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A).
H. pylori–infected mice that received H. pylori antimicrobial therapy
at 12 and 22 WPI also had up-regulated gastric IFN-c mRNA levels
compared with uninfected mice (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

Interestingly, gastric IFN-c mRNA levels were lower in infected mice
that received antimicrobial therapy at 8 WPI than in uninfected mice
and in mice receiving eradication therapy at 12 or 22 WPI (P < 0.05).
Compared with untreated H. pylori–infected mice, mRNA levels of
IFN-c were significantly reduced in infected mice receiving H. pylori
antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8, 12, and 22 WPI (P < 0.05).
Compared with uninfected mice, gastric TNF-a mRNA levels were
up-regulated in untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice (P <
0.001) and in infected mice that received H. pylori antimicrobial
therapy at 12 WPI (P < 0.01; Fig. 3B). Infected mice that received
H. pylori eradication therapy at 8 WPI had reduced gastric TNF-a
mRNA levels (P < 0.001), whereas infected mice that received
H. pylori eradication therapy at 22 WPI had similar gastric TNF-a
mRNA levels (P = 0.71), relative to uninfected mice. Compared with
untreated H. pylori–infected mice, gastric TNF-a mRNA levels were
significantly reduced in all mice that received eradication therapy
(P < 0.001). Among the infected mice receiving eradication therapy,
infected mice that received antimicrobial eradication therapy at
8 WPI had significantly lower TNF-a mRNA levels compared with
those mice that received antimicrobial eradication therapy at 12 or
22 WPI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). Infected mice that received
antimicrobial eradication therapy at 12 WPI had higher TNF-a
mRNA levels compared with mice that received antimicrobial
eradication therapy at 22 WPI (P < 0.05).
Compared with uninfected mice, gastric iNOS mRNA levels were
up-regulated in untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice
(P < 0.001; Fig. 3C). Compared with untreated H. pylori–infected
mice, gastric iNOS mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated
by H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy at all time points
(P V 0.05). Among the infected mice that received H. pylori
antimicrobial eradication therapy, those receiving antimicrobial
eradication therapy at 8 WPI had the lowest iNOS mRNA levels
compared with mice receiving antimicrobial eradication therapy at
12 or 22 WPI (P < 0.001).
The magnitude of H. pylori–specific antibody responses was
affected by H. pylori eradication. Compared with uninfected
mice, H. pylori–specific, Th1-associated IgG2a levels were significantly elevated in all infected mice with or without H. pylori
antimicrobial eradication therapy (P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). H. pylori
antimicrobial eradication therapy at all time points had no
significant effect on H. pylori–specific IgG2a levels compared with
untreated H. pylori–infected mice. However, infected mice that
received antimicrobial eradication therapy at 22 WPI had
statistically higher H. pylori–specific IgG2a levels compared with

(P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Compared with uninfected
mice, H. pylori–specific, Th2-associated IgG1 responses were also
elevated in infected mice receiving H. pylori antimicrobial
eradication therapy at 12 and 22 WPI (P < 0.05 and P = 0.06,
respectively) and in untreated infected mice (P = 0.08). Compared
with untreated H. pylori–infected mice, H. pylori–specific IgG1
levels were reduced in mice that received antimicrobial eradication
therapy at 8 WPI (P < 0.01), but were not affected by antimicrobial
eradication therapy at 12 or 22 WPI (P = 0.11). H. pylori–specific
IgG1 levels in mice that received antimicrobial eradication therapy
at 8 WPI were also lower than those in mice that received
antimicrobial eradication therapy at 12 or 22 WPI (P < 0.01 and

of gastric mucosa (29) and is up-regulated in H. felis–infected
INS-GAS mice (30). To further investigate the possible mechanisms for the inhibitory effect of H. pylori antimicrobial
eradication therapy on progression of gastric lesions, we
analyzed gastric Reg 1 mRNA levels. Compared with those in
uninfected mice, gastric Reg 1 mRNA levels were up-regulated in
untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A).
Infected mice receiving antimicrobial eradication therapy at 8,
12, or 22 WPI had gastric Reg 1 mRNA levels that were
comparable with each other and with those of uninfected mice.
Additionally, antimicrobial eradication therapy at all time points
significantly reduced Reg 1 expression compared with untreated,
infected mice (P < 0.01).
Gastric mucosal cell proliferation was also reduced in all
mice that received H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy.
Epithelial proliferating cells detected by Ki67 immunohistologic
staining were mainly in the isthmus regions of corpus mucosa in
uninfected INS-GAS mice and H. pylori–infected mice that received
eradication therapy at 12 WPI (Fig. 5B). Proliferating cells in the
corpus expanded from isthmus regions to hypertrophic foveolar
regions in untreated H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice. Compared
with uninfected mice, corpus epithelial proliferation, measured by
Ki67 LIs, was comparable in infected mice that received H. pylori
eradication at 8 WPI (P = 0.093), but was higher in infected mice
that received H. pylori eradication at 12 or 22 WPI and in untreated
H. pylori–infected mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C). H. pylori eradication at 8,
12, and 22 WPI significantly reduced Ki67 LI in the corpus
compared with untreated H. pylori–infected mice (P < 0.01).
Among the infected mice receiving H. pylori eradication therapy,
mice receiving eradication therapy at 8 WPI had the lowest corpus
epithelial LI when compared with mice receiving eradication
therapy at 12 or 22 WPI (P < 0.05 and P = 0.058, respectively).

antimicrobial eradication therapy attenuated progression of H.
pylori–induced gastric cancer, with early intervention providing the
maximum benefit.
In comparable rodent studies, antimicrobial eradication therapy
at 50 or 75 WPI prevented dysplasia in H. pylori–infected
Mongolian gerbils (14). H. felis–infected C57BL/6 mice developed
gastritis and invasive gastric cancer at 16 months postinfection
(15). These lesions could be prevented and mucosal architecture
restored if H. felis eradication therapy was instituted within
6 months of infection (15). Although H. felis eradication therapy at
12 months postinfection reduced the incidence of gastric cancer, it
had little effect on the reversal of dysplasia in the C57BL/6 model
(15). Consistent with the H. felis C57BL/6 model, our data show
that H. pylori eradication administered at the early stages of
H. pylori infection attenuated gastric inflammation, restored gastric
mucosal architecture, and prevented the development of gastric
cancer in INS-GAS mice. Moreover, because mature parietal cells
are necessary to maintain the integrity of gastric mucosa, parietal
cell loss may have resulted in dysregulation of gastric stem cell
homeostasis and migration-associated differentiation of pit and
zymogenic cells (31). Independent studies from our laboratory
confirmed parietal cell loss in uninfected INS-GAS mice after
5 months of age (approximately equivalent to 12–14 WPI in our
current study; ref. 18). Parietal cell mass and epithelial cell

Discussion
In this study, we used the well-characterized INS-GAS male
mouse model to elucidate the effect of H. pylori eradication therapy
conducted at different stages of H. pylori–associated gastric
pathology. H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice developed GIN or
gastric cancer at 28 WPI, accompanied by inflammation, loss of
parietal and chief cells, and hypertrophy of foveolar glands. When
H. pylori antimicrobial eradication therapy was instituted at 8 WPI,
the risk of GIN was reduced to a comparable level of uninfected
mice. Decreases in gastric inflammation, mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and Reg 1, and epithelial cell proliferation in
infected mice successfully treated with antimicrobials arguably
contributed to lower dysplasia and reduced gastric cancer risk,
particularly in those mice treated at 8 WPI. Eradication therapy at
12 and 22 WPI also resulted in a statistically lower degree of gastric
inflammation, dysplasia, mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and Reg I, and epithelial cell proliferation and prevented
progression to high-grade GIN, when compared with the data
recorded in untreated H. pylori–infected mice. However, eradication therapy at 12 and 22 WPI did not reverse selected
histopathologic changes, including inflammation, hyperplasia,
and dysplasia, to the levels of uninfected mice. Nevertheless, it is
also possible that the protective effect of H. pylori eradication at 12
or 22 WPI in INS-GAS mice may not be seen at 28 WPI. A longer
period of time after H. pylori eradication therapy may be required
in INS-GAS mice to observe the benefit of treatment during the late
stages of H. pylori infection. These data in aggregate indicate that

elevated in infected mice at 28 WPI irrespective of antimicrobial eradication when
compared with uninfected controls (**, P < 0.01; A). H. pylori eradication did not
significantly reduce serum levels of H. pylori –specific IgG2a. Compared with
untreated H. pylori –infected mice, mice that received H. pylori eradication at 22
WPI had higher IgG2a responses, as well as mice that received H. pylori
eradication at 8 or 12 WPI (#, P < 0.05; ##, P < 0.01). H. pylori –specific,
Th2-associated IgG1 levels were elevated in infected mice that received

H. pylori (*, P < 0.05; x, 0.05 < P < 0.10, compared with uninfected mice; B).
Infected mice receiving eradication therapy at 8 WPI had significantly lower H.

In contrast, infected mice that received H. pylori

down-regulated Reg 1 mRNA levels relative to infected

There were no different Reg 1 mRNA levels among
infected mice that received H. pylori eradication at 8,

mice, proliferating cells were restricted to the isthmus

eradication at 12 WPI. Proliferating cells expanded
from isthmus regions to foveolar regions in infected
INS-GAS mice that did not receive eradication
therapy. Ki67 LIs were significantly increased in
H. pylori –infected mice that received eradication

differentiation in H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice may be partially
restored and onset of precancerous lesions may be delayed by H.
pylori eradication therapy given at 8 WPI, but not by antimicrobial
therapy given at 12 WPI or later.
Gastric inflammation in INS-GAS mice positively correlated
with epithelial proliferation. Previous studies suggest that IFN-c
induces proliferation of gastric epithelial cells (32, 33). Increased
cell proliferation is a biomarker of gastric cancer risk, and
reversal to a normal epithelial proliferation has been associated
with a reduced gastric cancer risk (34, 35). In the current study,
gastric epithelial proliferation rates and Reg 1 mRNA levels in
H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice receiving H. pylori eradication
therapy at 8 WPI returned to levels similar to those of uninfected
mice, but not those in mice receiving eradication treatment at 12
or 22 WPI. With accumulated genetic damage in gastric mucosa
as a result of long-standing H. pylori infection, H. pylori infection
per se may no longer be necessary for sustained dysplasia and
progression to gastric cancer.
Unexpectedly, H. pylori–infected mice receiving eradication
therapy at 8 WPI had significantly lower degrees of gastric
inflammation as evidenced by less severe atrophy and downregulated IFN-c, TNF-a, and iNOS mRNA levels relative to the
H. pylori–unrelated gastric inflammation in uninfected INS-GAS
mice. The mechanism by which antimicrobial eradication therapy

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

exerted a protective effect on spontaneous gastric inflammation
in INS-GAS mice is unknown. One possible explanation is that
antimicrobial therapy eradicates not only H. pylori but also other
microorganisms that could cause gastric inflammation, particularly when there is an elevated gastric pH (36, 37). Our laboratory
observed that six of the eight bacterial species of altered
Schaedler flora (37) were present in the stomach of H.
pylori–infected INS-GAS mice.4 Experimental infection with
Acinetobacter lwoffii in C57BL/6 mice also causes chronic gastritis
as does H. pylori (38). Moreover, studies in humans and in various
animal models have shown that bacteria are important in
triggering inflammation and epithelial damage in the stomach
(39), suggesting the potential interaction between H. pylori and
other bacteria in the induction of gastric disease. In humans, a
dynamic change of gastric microbiota has been observed in H.
pylori–infected dyspeptic patients who received a triple antimicrobial therapy regimen with omeprazole, metronidazole, and
clarithromycin. Certain species of bacteria were eradicated
(e.g., Fusobacterium spp.) whereas some bacteria continued to
colonize the stomach (e.g., Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp.;

ref. 40). These findings in humans and mice suggest that
antibiotic treatment potentially changes gastric microbiota and
may affect gastric carcinogenesis. Further experimentation is
necessary to investigate the role of microbiota in H. pylori–
associated gastric disease.
Several clinical trials have examined the efficacy of H. pylori
eradication in preventing the development of preneoplastic
gastric lesions and gastric cancer in humans (5–9, 12, 13, 41).
Although a positive effect of H. pylori eradication therapy in
preventing gastric cancer has been observed in infected patients
who did not have preneoplastic lesions before H. pylori
eradication therapy (12), most clinical trails have not noted an
overall reduction of dysplasia or gastric cancer prevalence in
patients receiving H. pylori eradication therapy (6, 9, 12, 13).
Whether H. pylori eradication therapy reduces the prevalence of
gastric cancer remains inconclusive from these studies. One
possibility is that the incidence of gastric cancer is <50 per
100,000 even in countries with the highest prevalence of gastric
cancer, making statistical influence in studies with smaller
numbers of patients difficult (42). Additionally, the regression of
preneoplastic gastric lesions following H. pylori eradication is
positively correlated with the interval that the patient has been
free of H. pylori infection (9). This suggests that significant
improvement of gastric lesions and reduction of gastric cancer
prevalence may not be observed during the first few years after

treatment (43). In subsequent studies, it will be necessary to
recruit a larger population at risk for clinical trials with longerterm follow-up to validate the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in
preventing gastric cancer.
In summary, the current study in H. pylori–infected INS-GAS
mice supports the premise that H. pylori eradication therapy is the
most beneficial in preventing gastric cancer when antibiotics are
given at the early stages of H. pylori infection. When infected mice
have already developed metaplasia and dysplasia, H. pylori
eradication therapy substantially prevents progression to highgrade GIN but not to low-grade GIN. Our study using INS-GAS mice
is consistent with the Maastricht III Consensus Report, which
strongly recommends H. pylori eradication for the prevention of
gastric cancer, especially in patients with gastric ulcer, atrophy, or
family history of gastric cancer (44).
