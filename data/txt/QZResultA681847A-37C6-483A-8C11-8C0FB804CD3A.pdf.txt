Treatment Decisions and
Outcome in Very Elderly Patients
With Diffuse Large B-Cell
Lymphoma
We read with great interest the article by Williams et al that
discussed the clinical presentation, treatment approach,
and outcome of a large cohort of previously untreated
elderly (aged 66-80 years) and very elderly patients (aged
>80 years) diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL).1
In their study, a total of 3479 elderly and 1156 very
elderly patients with DLBCL who were recruited using
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry
were analysed retrospectively. As initially hypothesized,
very elderly patients were less likely to receive treatment
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone (CHOP) alone or in association with rituximab (R-CHOP) and were more likely to receive the combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone with or without rituximab or only observation; remarkably, treatment choice was influenced by
both clinical and socioeconomic variables.1 Treatment
with R-CHOP for >4 cycles was associated with
improved overall survival (OS) for very elderly patients,
and therefore the authors suggested this regimen should
be considered as a feasible first-line treatment option.
We greatly appreciate the effort to collect a large
amount of data regarding very elderly patients with
DLBCL because to the best of our knowledge this population is not represented in most clinical trials. We agree
with the authors that a curative approach with R-CHOP
should not be denied only because of advanced age and
that a careful analysis of clinical, biological, and demographic characteristics should be made before treatment is
selected. Despite the good quality of the study, we would
like to make some observations. Because the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results database does not include
the receipt of oral medications and patients who died
within 6 months of diagnosis were excluded, the analyzed
cohort could not be representative of the real population.
Moreover, only the CHOP regimen and the combination
of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone with or
without rituximab and observation were examined, and we
believe it could be interesting to include patients receiving
other anthracycline-containing regimens (ACRs) or non–
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.1

Anthracyclines have been considered too toxic for
very elderly patients,2,3 but their use has markedly improved
survival and represents a milestone in the treatment of
DLBCL.4,5 R-CHOP became the gold standard for elderly
patients after the study by Coiffier et al was published, in
which patients who were randomized to R-CHOP or
CHOP therapy demonstrated an improved complete
response rate, event-free survival, and OS, with manageable
toxicity.6 These results were confirmed in the long-term
follow-up analysis and in other large randomized studies,
such as the US Intergroup Trial and the RICOVER-60
(Rituximab with CHOP over age 60 years) trial.7-9
In our opinion and as suggested by the International
Society of Geriatric Oncology,10 alternative approaches
are feasible without eliminating anthracyclines, such as
dose reduction or the selection of a less toxic compound.11-17 In a prospective phase 2 study, Peyrade et al
recruited 150 patients (with a median age 83 years) to
receive attenuated immunochemotherapy (R-miniCHOP). The median progression-free survival and OS
were 21 months and 29 months, respectively, with 2-year
progression-free survival and OS rates of 47% and 59%,
respectively; the treatment was found to be well tolerated
and the most common adverse event was grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (CTCAEv.3).11 The weekly regimen of cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, etoposide,
bleomycin, and prednisone with or without rituximab
represents another interesting option allowing for the
modulation of dose intensity and its adaptation to the
patient’s condition.12,13
When substituted for doxorubicin, a nonpegylated
liposomal doxorubicin demonstrated comparable efficacy
with an acceptable toxicity profile in elderly patients in
several phase 2 trials and a recently published review suggested its use in patients who are not eligible for conventional ACRs because of age and cardiac comorbidity or
high cardiovascular risk.14-17
Finally, we underscore the importance of geriatric
assessment. As recommended by the Italian Lymphoma
Foundation, since 2009 our institution has used the
Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), the Basic
Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of
Daily Living, and comorbidities score according to the
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G).18
We have assessed >80 elderly patients to date and
have classified each as fit, unfit, or frail. Fit patients are
candidates for standard R-CHOP therapy whereas the
optimal treatment for unfit and frail patients remains an
unmet need. In particular, these patients could be treated,

respectively, with regimens including “less toxic” anthracyclines and/or attenuated doses, and chemotherapy-free
approaches (eg, rituximab and lenalidomide) or metronomic therapy.19-22 A multicenter study from the Italian
Lymphoma Foundation to prospectively assess the role of
CGA in a consecutive series of elderly patients with
DLBCL with centralized automatic distribution in the 3
groups is currently ongoing.
In conclusion, ACRs should remain the treatment of
choice for elderly patients with DLBCL, even if a dose
reduction is often necessary (eg, R-miniCHOP) and the
use of nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin should be
encouraged for this population. CGA should be recommended and guide clinicians to find the most adequate
therapeutic strategy.
