BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination
(cDC) and sequential (sDC) weekly docetaxel and carboplatin in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS: Participants were randomized to either weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and
8 and carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) ¼ 6 on day 1, every 3 weeks or docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8,
every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by carboplatin AUC ¼ 6 on day 1, every 3 weeks for 6 cycles or until disease progression. The primary endpoint was measurable progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Between January 2004
and March 2007, 150 participants were enrolled. The response rate was 55.4% and 43.2% for those treated with cDC
and sDC, respectively. The median PFS was 13.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9-16.8) for cDC and 8.4
months (95% CI, 7.1-11.0) for sDC. On the basis of an exploratory analysis, patients treated with sDC were at a 62%
increased risk of disease progression compared to those treated with cDC (hazard ratio ¼ 1.62; 95% CI, 1.08-2.45;
P ¼.02). The median overall survival time was similar in both groups (33.2 and 30.1 months, P ¼.2). The incidence of
grade 2 or 3 neurotoxicity and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher with cDC than with sDC (11.7% vs 8.5%; 36.8% vs
11.3%). The sDC group demonstrated significant improvements in the Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy–
Ovarian, Quality of Life Trial Outcome Index scores compared with the combination cohort (P ¼.013). CONCLUSIONS:

Combination chemotherapy with platinum doublets has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS),
and in some cases overall survival (OS), when compared with single-agent carboplatin in women with platinum-sensitive
recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).1-3 Consequently, platinum doublets are widely used to treat platinum-sensitive
disease. Although the platinum-based combinations yielded improved clinical outcome, they were also associated with
greater toxicity.1-3 Planned sequential monotherapy may provide equivalent outcomes while minimizing toxicity.

Sequential monotherapy with delivery of a nonplatinum
agent followed by carboplatin may extend the platinumfree interval (PFI) and potentially enhance the probability
of response to carboplatin.4-6
Docetaxel is one of the most active agents in platinum-resistant EOC, with response rates (RR) ranging
from 22% to 40%.7-13 Docetaxel in combination with
carboplatin is also effective as first-line therapy for
EOC.14,15 The predominant docetaxel-related toxicity is
neutropenia. To decrease the incidence of hematologic
toxicity, weekly docetaxel, either alone (30-50 mg/m2 per
week intravenously [iv])16-22 or in combination (30-35
mg/m2 per week iv) with carboplatin (weekly area under
the curve [AUC] ¼ 2 or bolus AUC ¼ 5-6 every 3-4
weeks) has been evaluated.23-25 Weekly docetaxel
appeared to have similar activity compared with 3-week
administration, with a favorable toxicity profile.
Given the promising activity of docetaxel and carboplatin in treatment of EOC as well as the paucity of data
evaluating combination versus planned sequential monotherapy, we sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
combination (cDC) and sequential (sDC) weekly docetaxel and carboplatin in women with recurrent platinumsensitive disease. The primary objective of the trial was
measurable PFS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The study was designed as a phase 3 randomized comparative trial of cDC and sDC in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC with a target accrual of 250 patients;
enrollment began in January 2004. Because of slow
accrual, the study design was amended in January 2006 to
a phase 2 trial. The study closed to enrollment in March
2007. All investigators obtained approval from their
respective institutional review boards and in accord with
an assurance filed with and approved by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The trial was registered in the National Institutes of Health clinical trials
database (NCT00090610).
Eligibility
Eligible patients must have had platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube
cancer. Platinum-sensitive disease was defined as a complete response to front-line treatment with a platinum
compound and a treatment-free interval without clinical
evidence of progressive disease for greater than 6 months.

3284

Patients must have had 1 prior platinum-based regimen.
Prior treatment with paclitaxel was not required. Prior
treatment with docetaxel was not allowed. Patients were
required to have either measurable or evaluable disease
by imaging, physical examination, or cancer antigen 125
(CA-125). Patients may have received 1 prior biologic therapy, either combined with chemotherapy in the first-line
setting or as a single-agent for recurrent disease. Patients
may have received consolidation therapy. Additional
requirements included a performance status (PS),
ECOG, of 0 to 2, age  18 years, absolute neutrophil
count (ANC)  1500/mm3, platelets  100,000/mm3,
hemoglobin  8.0 g/dL, creatinine  1.5 times the upper
limit of normal, adequate liver function tests, and
neuropathy  grade 1. Patients provided written informed
consent. Eligible patients were centrally randomized using
a block size of 10 in a 1:1 ratio.
The study used commercially available drugs
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Participants in the combination arm received
docetaxel (30 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 8) combined with
carboplatin (AUC ¼ 6 mg/mL/minute iv on day 1) every
3 weeks. Participants in the sequential arm received docetaxel (30 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks. Treatment was discontinued if the patient had progressive
disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or had a complete
response (CR) after 6 cycles of therapy. A patient who
achieved a CR on docetaxel was followed until recurrence,
at which time treatment with carboplatin was initiated.
Patients who had PD or those who after 6 cycles of docetaxel had either a partial response (PR) or stable disease
(SD) were treated with carboplatin AUC ¼ 6 iv every 3
weeks. Carboplatin was discontinued if the patient had
PD, unacceptable toxicity, or completed 6 cycles of treatment and achieved a CR. Those who had a PR or SD after
6 cycles of cDC or carboplatin on the sequential arm
could continue therapy at the investigator’s discretion.
Dose modifications were made according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity. The day 8
dose was administered if the ANC  1000 mm3 and
platelets  75,000/mm3. In the cDC arm, if day 8 was
omitted, docetaxel was reduced to 25 mg/m2 and carboplatin to AUC ¼ 5. A second dose adjustment was
allowed for docetaxel to 20 mg/m2 and carboplatin to
AUC ¼ 4. In the sDC arm, if day 8 was omitted, docetaxel was reduced to 25 mg/m2. A second dose adjustment
was allowed for docetaxel to 20 mg/m2. Successive dose
reductions by 1 level were required for ANC  500/mm3
and/or platelets  50,000/mm3; any grade neutropenia

associated with infection; grade 4 neutropenia > 5 days;
any grade thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding;
serum total bilirubin higher than the upper limit of normal on the day of treatment; grade 2 to 4 stomatitis; and
grade 2 to 4 neuropathy. For any other grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, both docetaxel and carboplatin were
withheld until resolution to grade  1, then reinstituted
with a dose reduction. Participants who had more than 2
dose reductions or toxicity-related delays greater than 3
weeks were removed from the study.
Patients were evaluated prior to randomization and
at every cycle. The baseline evaluation was performed
within 14 days before the first dose of study drug(s) and
included a medical history, physical examination, laboratory analyses, and quality of life (QOL) assessment using
the Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy-Ovarian
(FACT-O), version 4.26,27 Within 28 days before the first
dose of study drug(s), baseline disease status was documented by imaging. Physical examination, chemistries,
toxicity assessment, and CA-125 were performed prior to
every cycle, and a complete blood count was obtained
weekly. QOL assessments were obtained prior to every
other cycle and at study termination. Radiologic assessments were performed every 9 weeks.
Response was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0)28 and level of the
tumor marker CA-125.29 The safety analyses included all
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug(s).
Safety parameters included serious adverse events (SAEs)
related to treatment, limited toxicity events (neurologic,
hematologic, renal, and hepatic), PS changes, and laboratory tests. Toxicity was graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 3.0.
Statistical Methods
Initially, the study was developed to compare measurable
PFS of the 2 treatment groups. Because of slow accrual, the
primary objective was amended to evaluate measurable PFS
for each arm separately to a historical control. The direct
comparison of the 2 treatment groups was included as an
exploratory analysis. Based on data at the time the study was
developed, the median PFS for patients with platinum-sensitive EOC treated with standard therapy was 8 months,30
and it was expected that the increase in PFS in this study
would be from 8 to 12 months or, assuming exponential
distribution, an increase in the PFS rate from 0.5 to 0.63.
The null hypothesis tested was that the PFS rate at 8 months
would be 0.5 versus the alternative that it would be 0.63 or

higher at the 1-sided 0.1 significance level.31 Powering each
group separately, the sample size of 68 evaluable patients
per arm allowed a power of 80% if the true PFS rate at 8
months was 0.63. Approximately 75 patients per arm were
enrolled to account for potential inevaluability. The study
was not powered to detect differences in OS. PFS was
defined as the period from date of randomization until the
date of PD, recurrence, or date of death. In the sequential
arm, if PD occurred after completing 1 or more cycles of
docetaxel, the date of progression was based on the subsequent response to carboplatin. If there was not a response to
carboplatin, the date of progression was reported as the date
of progression while on docetaxel. If there was a response to
carboplatin, date of progression was reported as the next
date of progression after starting carboplatin. The analysis
was repeated using the first date of progression after starting
carboplatin, regardless of the response or progression while
on docetaxel. In the absence of defined PD, patients were
censored at the date of last tumor assessment or the initiation of nonprotocol therapy, whichever was earlier. The
secondary objectives of the study were to assess overall PFS
(measurable and assessable PD), measurable recurrence-free
survival, OS, RR, QOL, and safety. Survival distributions
and median times were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier,
and Brookmeyer and Crowley methods.32
For PFS, exploratory univariate Cox proportional
hazards models were fit individually for each covariate
both by treatment and overall. Covariates included age
(60 years vs >60 years), race (white vs nonwhite), anatomic site of cancer (ovarian vs peritoneal/tubal), and consolidation therapy (yes vs no). A Cox proportional
hazards regression model with stepwise model-building
options was also used to explore the effect of the covariates
on PFS. RR was summarized using the exact binomial
method. The primary endpoint for the QOL data analysis
was the FACT-O Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score.
Repeated measures mixed-model analysis of covariance
was used to compare treatment differences in FACT-O
scores.33-35 Fixed effects included treatment, center,
assessment cycle, and the treatment by assessment cycle
interaction. The covariance structure was set as a compound symmetry matrix. Baseline PS was included as a
covariate. The QOL assessment was performed in a comparative fashion, because historical raw data were not
available to evaluate each arm separately.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all
patients who were randomized and received at least 1 cycle
of treatment. The evaluable population included all patients
who received at least 2 cycles of treatment with at least 1

tumor assessment. All patients receiving at least 1 dose of
study drug were included in the toxicity analysis. All analyses
were conducted using SAS, version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) or higher. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were used, and the reported P values were 2-sided tests.
Role of the Funding Source
This was an investigator-initiated study supported by
Sanofi-Aventis US, Bridgewater, NJ. The study was independently managed, and the data were analyzed by PPD,
Wilmington, NC. PPD and the principal investigator had
complete access to all the study data. The QOL analysis
was performed by the Center for Health Outcomes
Research, United BioSource Corp., Bethesda, Md. The
final responsibility for the manuscript and the decision to
submit for publication was made by the investigators.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From January 2004 to March 2007, 150 participants
were enrolled (Figure 1). The demographic characteristics
were well balanced between treatment arms (Table 1). A
total of 401 cycles were completed in the combination
arm and 618 in the sequential arm. The median number
of cycles delivered per patient was 6 (cDC, 6 cycles,
range ¼ 1-12; sDC, 9 cycles, range ¼ 2-22). The number
of docetaxel doses administered was 874 and 574 in the
cDC and sDC arms, respectively. The number of carboplatin doses was 780 and 343 in the cDC and sDC arms,
respectively. The actual mean doses and relative dose
intensities for docetaxel and carboplatin were similar
(docetaxel ¼ 28.8 and 29.5 mg/m2, 96.0% and 98.3%;
carboplatin ¼ 5.8 and 5.9 AUC, 96.7% and 98.3%, for
cDC and sDC, respectively).
Subsequent Therapy
Overall, 46 patients (62.2%) in the combination arm and
50 patients (67.6%) in sequential arm received subsequent chemotherapy. The initial relapse therapies were
evenly distributed between the treatment groups and
included liposomal doxorubicin (21.6% vs 29.7%), topotecan (6.8% vs 8.1%), gemcitabine (0% vs 5.4%), and
paclitaxel (4.1% in both arms).
Toxicity
Anemia was the most frequent hematologic toxicity
(Table 2). The incidence of grade 2 to 4 anemia was similar between the 2 groups (33.4% and 33.8%); however,

3286

erythropoietin agents were more frequently administered
in the combination group (50.0% vs 33.8%). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (36.8% vs 11.3%),
grade 2 or 3 neurotoxicity (11.7% vs 8.5%), and the use
of colony-stimulating factors (22.1% vs 14.1%) were
higher with cDC than sDC. Twelve patients discontinued
treatment because of adverse events (cDC, 9.3%; sDC,
6.8%). The most common reasons for discontinuation
were hematologic and neurologic toxicity.
Overall, 34 patients (cDC, 16; sDC, 18) experienced a total of 45 SAEs (20 with cDC; 25 with sDC).
The most frequently reported SAE was intestinal obstruction, which was experienced by 8 (5.4%) patients (1 with
cDC; 7 with sDC). Only 6 of the SAEs were considered
to be study-related (2 SAEs with cDC [allergic reaction
and diarrhea]; 4 SAEs with sDC [allergic reaction, tongue
edema, vomiting, and pneumonia]).
Responses and Survival
The RRs (CR þ PR) were 55.4% (17.6% with CR and
37.8% with PR) and 43.3% (12.2% with CR and 31.1%
with PR) for cDC and sDC, respectively (Table 3). The
RR for weekly docetaxel in the sequential arm was 13.5%
(1 patient (1.4%) with CR; 9 patients (12.2%) with PR).
Nineteen (25.7%) had SD, and 45 (60.8%) progressed prior
to receiving carboplatin. Fourteen percent (10 of 74) of
patients on the sequential arm did not receive carboplatin.
The RR for sequential carboplatin after discontinuation of
docetaxel in the sDC arm was 39.1% (25 of 64) of patients
(5 patients [7.8%] with CR; 20 patients [31.3%] with PR).
Eighteen (28.1%) patients had SD. The median PFS was
13.7 months (95% CI, 9.9-16.8 months) for cDC compared with an expected median PFS of 8 months in the historical control,29 whereas the median PFS was 8.4 months
(95% CI, 7.1-11.0 months) for sDC (Figure 2A). The PFS
analysis was repeated for sDC using the carboplatin-based
date of progression with similar findings: median PFS of 9.8
months (95% CI, 8.1-16.2 months). On the basis of an
exploratory analysis, patients treated with sDC were at a
62% increased risk of disease progression compared with
those treated with cDC (hazard ratio ¼ 1.62; 95% CI, 1.082.45; P ¼ .02) (Table 4). Similar findings were found for
PFS based on measurable or assessable disease (11.2 months
for cDC [95% CI, 8.8-13.7 months]; 8.0 months for sDC
[95% CI, 6.2-9.1 months]). In the 22 patients (13 with
cDC; 9 with sDC) who achieved a CR, the median RFS was
longer (20.0 months) for the cDC group compared with the
sDC group (15.8 months). Median OS was similar in both
groups (33.2 and 30.1 months; P ¼ .2) (Figure 2B).

DISCUSSION
Our study is the first prospective randomized trial to evaluate combination and planned sequential chemotherapy
in women with platinum-sensitive EOC. The cDC regimen was associated with a PFS advantage over an expected
historical PFS and planned sDC in our exploratory analysis. These results are similar to those reported by others
evaluating platinum-based doublets in women with platinum-sensitive EOC.1-3,23 The combination regimen did
have a higher frequency of hematologic and neurologic
adverse events and was associated with decreased QOL.

3288

Our data regarding QOL differ from those reported in
the ICON 4 (International Collaborative Group for
Ovarian Neoplasia)/AGO-OVAR 2.2 (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Gynaekologische Onkologie Studiengruppe
Ovarialkarzinom), GEICO (Grupo Español de Investigación en Cáncer de Ovario), and AGO-OVAR 2.5 trials,
which found no differences in QOL between single-agent
and multiple-agent treatments.1-3 This disparity may be
due to the varying chemotherapy regimens between trials
or the different QOL tools that were used. Although definitive conclusions about the optimal chemotherapy regimen for women who have platinum-sensitive disease are
difficult to draw, our data highlight the tradeoff between
efficacy and toxicity that is central to treatment decisions.
The RR in our study for the combination arm
(55%) was similar to the RR in ICON 4 (66%) and
AGO-OVAR 2.5 trials (47.2%).2,3 The RR with sequential carboplatin following discontinuation of docetaxel in
the sDC arm was 39.1%, compared with 30.9% and 50%
in the AGO-OVAR 2.5 and GEICO trials, respectively.1,2 The PFI varies between the trials, and specific information regarding the PFI subgroups in our study is not
available. However, the overall RR for sequential carboplatin was within the expected range. Prolonging the PFI
with docetaxel did not appear to enhance the RR or PFS
with carboplatin reintroduction. The RR of 13.5% for
weekly docetaxel in our study was less than expected in a
platinum-sensitive population and less than previously
reported for 3-week docetaxel (22%-40%)9-13 or weekly
docetaxel (18.9%)36 in women who had recurrent EOC.
Berkenblit et al. reported a 6.9% RR for weekly docetaxel;
however, that RR was in a heavily pretreated, platinumresistant population.37 The RR in our study may have
been artificially reduced because the protocol required
that the chemotherapy regimen for patients who had a PR
or SD after 6 cycles of weekly docetaxel be changed to carboplatin. With continued treatment, patients who had a
PR or SD may have ultimately achieved a better response.
This design is an important limitation and may have compromised the clinical benefit from each component of
sequential therapy and maximal extension of the PFI prior
to platinum reintroduction. It is also possible that weekly
docetaxel does not have equivalent efficacy to 3-week
docetaxel, but Baker and colleagues demonstrated that
docetaxel pharmacokinetics were similar for weekly and
3-week regimens, as manifested by similar mean docetaxel
clearance values and half-lives.38 A comparison of weekly
and 3-week docetaxel has not been conducted in patients
with EOC. However, there have been several randomized

comparative trials of weekly docetaxel (33.3-40 mg/m2
per week) to 3-week docetaxel (75-100 mg/m2 every 3
weeks) in lung and breast cancer as well as a meta-analysis
in lung cancer that have demonstrated similar survival
outcomes.16,39-43 Alternatively, the lower RR may have
been secondary to the decreased relative dose intensity of
docetaxel 30 mg/m2 for 2 or 3 weeks (20 mg/m2 per
week) in our study compared with 35 mg/m2 per week for

5 or 6 weeks (29 mg/m2 per week) and 100 mg/m2 every
3 weeks (33 mg/m2 per week) in the studies reported by
Tinker et al.36 and Rose et al.,11 respectively.
Although there are no prior randomized trials that
compare combination and sequential chemotherapy in
women with EOC, we can extrapolate from comparative
trials of combination versus single-agent first-line chemotherapy conducted in women with advanced EOC.44,45

Progressive disease included those with increasing disease, biologic progression (CA-125) or symptomatic deterioration.
Patients with baseline measurable disease who did not have on-study radiographic tumor reevaluation were counted as
treatment failures (progressive disease).
b
Ten patients on sequential therapy did not receive carboplatin: 2 died, 2 requested to be withdrawn, 2 were withdrawn
at request of investigator, 2 were withdrawn due to protocol violations (these patients were randomized to sequential therapy but received combination therapy), 1 was withdrawn due to progression, and 1 patient had a complete response.

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier estimates are shown for (A) progression-free survival and (B) overall survival in the intent-to-treat population. The median progression-free survival was 13.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9-16.8 months) for combination
therapy and 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.1-11.0 months) for sequential therapy (P ¼.019). The hazard ratio for progression in the sequential arm was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.08-2.45; P ¼.02) compared to the combination arm. The median overall survival time was similar in
both groups (33.2 and 30.1 months; P ¼.2).

Although these trials were not planned assessments of
sequential therapy, they do provide an insight into this
approach. In Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
#132, single-agent paclitaxel was felt to be inferior to plat-

inum-based regimens (cisplatin alone or combination
paclitaxel and cisplatin) based on RR and PFS. However,
there were no differences in OS between the treatment
arms. Combination paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 per 24 hours)

and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) had a better toxicity profile than
single-agent cisplatin (100 mg/m2). Therefore, the combination regimen was deemed the preferred first-line treatment for EOC. A criticism of this study is that
approximately 50% of patients in the single-agent arms
were switched to a nonprotocol therapy before documented disease progression. ICON 3 compared combination paclitaxel and carboplatin to single-agent carboplatin
or combination cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and cisplatin (CAP). There were no differences in PFS or OS
between the treatment groups. In the ICON 3 study, the
reported use of taxane therapy prior to progression in the
control arm was infrequent (3%); however, approximately
30% of the patients in the control groups subsequently
received taxane-based therapy at the time of first progression. Crossover to the alternative agent was not a part of
any of these study designs. This evidence must be cautiously interpreted, because the primary endpoint for
GOG #132 was PFS, and as such, that study lacked the
power to detect an OS difference. However, the results
from these trials provide circumstantial evidence that
planned sequential treatment with single-agent therapy
may be an acceptable option.
Our study was restricted by the slow accrual that
resulted in a significant change in the study design. The
reduced sample size and randomized phase 2 design limited the ability to compare these 2 regimens directly. Further limitations include a lack of independent radiologic
and central pathology review as well as experimenter/
expectation bias. Some may question the use of PFS as the
primary endpoint. The FDA recently stated that there is
strong rationale for using PFS in the first-line setting.46 In
the setting of platinum-sensitive EOC where women are

Cancer

treated with multiple relapse regimens, we believe that
PFS is a valid primary endpoint.
It is important to acknowledge that the outcomes
may have been different if the sequential arm used carboplatin followed by docetaxel. The initial RR would have
been higher and toxicity would have been minimal. A
randomized study compared paclitaxel to CAP in women
with very platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC (Treatment
Free Interval > 12 months). The PFS and OS rates were
significantly higher for CAP compared with paclitaxel
(15.7 vs 9 months, P ¼ .04; 34.7 vs 25.8 months, P ¼ .04,

respectively).47 We did not explore sequential carboplatin
followed by docetaxel due to limited resources and our interest in exploring the concept of extending the PFI to
enhance the subsequent response to carboplatin.
In conclusion, the results of this trial suggest that
cDC may provide a PFS advantage over sDC, based on
our exploratory analysis. However, the toxicity profile and
QOL findings favor sDC. Several parameters need to be
considered in the recurrent disease setting, including not
only survival but also toxicity and QOL. Both treatment
strategies may be acceptable for women with platinumsensitive EOC, considering their disease burden, PS, preexisting toxicities, and therapeutic goals.
