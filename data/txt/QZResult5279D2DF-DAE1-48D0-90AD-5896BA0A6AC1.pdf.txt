ABSTRACT
Clinical studies evaluating targeted BRAFV600E inhibitors in advanced thyroid
cancer patients are currently underway. Vemurafenib (BRAFV600E inhibitor)
monotherapy has shown promising results thus far, although development of
resistance is a clinical challenge. The objective of this study was to characterize
development of resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition and to identify targets for effective
combination therapy. We created a line of BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells
resistant to vemurafenib by treating with increasing concentrations of the drug. The
resistant BCPAP line was characterized and compared to its sensitive counterpart with
respect to signaling molecules thought to be directly related to resistance. Expression
and phosphorylation of several critical proteins were analyzed by Western blotting
and dimerization was evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Resistance to vemurafenib in
BCPAP appeared to be mediated by constitutive overexpression of phospho-ERK and
by resistance to inhibition of both phospho-mTOR and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein
after vemurafenib treatment. Expression of potential alternative signaling molecule,
CRAF, was not increased in the resistant line, although formation of CRAF dimers
appeared increased. Expression of membrane receptors HER2 and HER3 was greatly
amplified in the resistant cancer cells. Papillary thyroid cancer cells were capable
of overcoming targeted BRAFV600E inhibition by rewiring of cell signal pathways in
response to prolonged vemurafenib therapy. Our study suggests that in vitro culture
of cancer cells may be useful in assessing molecular resistance pathways. Potential
therapies in advanced thyroid cancer patients may combine vemurafenib with
inhibitors of CRAF, HER2/HER3, ERK, and/or mTOR to delay or abort development
of resistance.

INTRODUCTION

called B-Raf which is a serine/threonine kinase. Results
of an ongoing phase II clinical study including patients
with metastatic or unresectable BRAFV600E-positive
papillary thyroid cancer demonstrate that vemurafenib
(BRAFV600E kinase inhibitor) has an anti-tumor
effect when used as a monotherapy (Brose et al., 2013
ECCO/ESMO/ESTRO Annual Meeting). These results
are consistent with an earlier phase I clinical study, a
case study involving a patient with advanced papillary
thyroid cancer, and off-label use of vemurafenib (VMR)
in 17 patients [4–6].

Thyroid cancer incidence in the United States is
increasing and patients with metastatic and radioiodineresistant disease are in need of new treatments. Targeted
therapy is a promising option for papillary thyroid cancer
cases in which surgery and radioiodine are ineffective.
In particular, targeting BRAFV600E, a mutation found in
over one-half of papillary thyroid cancers and associated
with worse prognosis, may provide clinical utility [1–3].

Early clinical successes of VMR can be attributed
to the mechanism of action it was designed for- inhibiting
overactive BRAFV600E kinase within the pro-survival
MAPK/ERK cell signaling pathway. ERK signaling
serves as a link to convert extracellular stimuli into
transcriptional programs affecting various processes such
as cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
Dysregulation of the ERK pathway occurs in one-third of
all cancers and is mediated by genetic lesions resulting in
events such as overexpression or constitutive activation
of kinases and/or continuous production of activating
ligands [7]. Within papillary thyroid cancer, mutations
including BRAFV600E, RET/PTC and/or RAS are found
in over 70% of cases. Each mutation contributes to ERK
pathway activation and tends to be mutually exclusive
within thyroid tumors [8, 9]. The most common mutation,
BRAFV600E, results in a constitutively active kinase
driving ERK signaling and thyroid cancer progression.
Presence of the BRAFV600E mutation has been correlated
with recurrence, resistance to radioiodine, and increased
mortality [3, 10–13]. Inhibition of BRAFV600E kinase
with VMR within thyroid cancer cells has been shown to
inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis [14–16].
A problem to overcome in the treatment of patients
with small molecule inhibitors such as VMR is the
development of drug resistance due to the adaptability
of most cancers [17, 18]. Cancers treated with a single
specific inhibitor of a ERK pathway protein will inevitably
lose responsiveness to the drug and continue to express
activated ERK [19]. The development of adaptive
resistance can began shortly after treatment in cancer
cells due to sudden inhibition of signaling leading to
changes in feedback mechanisms. A signal rewiring is
initiated and will persist if successful. It is also generally
accepted that certain cells within a solid tumor are better
able to accommodate the presence of a targeted inhibitor,
perhaps due to a mutation or availability of alternative
signaling proteins or pathways. Such cells will be clonally
selected for in an evolutionary way after treatment with
the inhibitor leading to drug-resistance of the tumor [17].
Based on data in literature and our prior findings, we
hypothesize that determining targets of VMR resistance
in thyroid cancer may be useful in developing rational
combination therapy that limits resistance or exploits
susceptibilities of resistant tumors. Successful clinical
trials of VMR in melanoma patients demonstrated
improved survival, although resistance often developed
months after treatment [20, 21]. A number of studies found
that resistance in these cases occurred mainly through
reactivation of ERK signaling [22–31]. ERK reactivation
can be propagated by increased expression or activity of
upstream signaling molecules such as receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) in response to VMR treatment [32–34].
In addition, studies have attributed resistance to increased
expression of kinases COT and CRAF, which are capable

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of contributing to ERK signaling independent of BRAF
protein [22, 23]. It is expected that inhibitors of the kinases
shown to be activated by persistent treatment with VMR,
when used in combination therapy, may delay or abolish
resistance to VMR.
There are few studies which examine possible
resistance mechanisms to BRAFV600E inhibition in
thyroid cancer. One group found that VMR treatment
led to increased transcription and expression of HER3
receptor in thyroid cancer cells. These cells could be
sensitized to BRAF inhibition with the addition of HER
kinase inhibitor lapatinib [35]. In our study, we created
resistance to VMR in vitro using BCPAP papillary thyroid
cancer cells. We then analyzed differences in expression of
ERK pathway signaling molecules in normal thyroid cells,
papillary thyroid cancer cells, VMR-resistant papillary
thyroid cancer cells, and inherently-resistant anaplastic
thyroid cancer cells. Signaling molecules in the study
included CRAF, HER2, HER3, ERK, and mTOR. We
hypothesized that resistance develops through reactivation
of ERK, mediated by increased upstream signaling and
activation of molecules providing signaling alternatives
to BRAFV600E. The goal of the present study was to
identify target molecules that may contribute to VMR
resistance in thyroid cancer cells. Further studies in which
VMR is included in combination therapy may greatly
benefit BRAFV600E-positive advanced thyroid cancer
patients.

RESULTS
In vitro resistance to vemurafenib develops in
BCPAP cells
We investigated resistance to BRAFV600E
inhibition in vitro by treating BRAFV600E-positive
papillary thyroid cells (BCPAP) with increasing
concentrations of VMR (BRAFV600E inhibitor). Cells
were initially susceptible to this drug and showed a lack
of detectable phospho-ERK after 24 hour treatment,
thereby demonstrating inhibition of signaling. Cells
began to express detectable levels of phospho-ERK
after the subsequent 12 μM treatment period and
continued to show expression throughout the rest of
the experiment, after treatment up to 16 μM VMR
(Figure 1A). Reappearance of phospho-ERK indicates
that cells adapted to activate ERK despite the VMRmediated block of BRAFV600E. These conditioned
cells (resistant BCPAP) were maintained in culture
and subjected to proliferation assays. Resistant BCPAP
cells demonstrated diminished growth-inhibitory effects
in response to VMR compared to BCPAP in our prior
study (Figure 1B) [36]. In addition, an Alamar blue
viability assay supported these results, since resistant
cells maintained higher ability to reduce resazurin

classical RAS-dependent kinase cascade, it is thought
that dimer formation of CRAF is necessary to propagate
signaling, which is not the case for mutated BRAFV600E
signaling [37]. Since increased CRAF expression was
shown to contribute to VMR resistance in melanoma,
we analyzed CRAF expression and dimer formation in
our thyroid cancer cells in response to this drug. Thyroid
cells were treated with 10 µM VMR and collected at
various time points including 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and
48 hours. Cell lines included BRAF-wild-type normal
thyroid cells (Nthy-ori 3-1), BRAFV600E-positive
papillary thyroid cancer cells (BCPAP), VMR-resistant
BCPAP, and BRAFV600E-positive anaplastic thyroid
cancer cells (8505c). Throughout treatment, CRAF

CRAF expression is not directly modulated
by vemurafenib and resistance may be
characterized by increased CRAF dimer
formation
Within the ERK signaling pathway, CRAF is a
wild-type RAF isotype, and can transmit signals from
GTP-bound RAS to MEK, which activates ERK. In this

expression and phosphorylation remained constant in the
four thyroid cell lines, indicating that expression is not
directly modulated by VMR (Figure 2A–2D).
To compare total CRAF expression among the
thyroid cell lines and to determine if the expression of
CRAF changes in response to VMR after resistance,
we included all four cell lines on a Western blot after
24 hours of treatment. We found no difference in
overall CRAF expression among cell lines (Figure 2E).
However, when an immunoprecipitation experiment
was conducted using an anti-CRAF antibody to extract
protein complexes from cell lysates, a greater amount of
CRAF was isolated from VMR-resistant cells compared
to normal BCPAP (Figure 2E). This data indicates that
although total CRAF levels do not change, the formation
of CRAF dimers may be increased in VMR-resistant
BCPAP cells. Since activation of upstream RAS promotes
RAF dimerization, we predicted that the increase in
CRAF dimers occurred as a result of enhanced upstream
signaling due to loss of negative feedback by ERK. In
normal Nthy-ori 3-1 thyroid cells, an increase in CRAF

dimers in response to 24 hour VMR treatment was
observed, which may reflect the RAF inhibitor paradox,
in which wild-type RAF dimer interactions are enhanced
(Figure 2E).

BCPAP cells are sensitive to oscillatory inhibition
of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib and resistant
BCPAP cells are not
Interestingly, treating thyroid cells with VMR
over various time points revealed an oscillatory pattern
of ERK inhibition in BCPAP and 8505c. Inhibition
occurred early at 1–3 hours and then phospho-ERK
expression rebounded around 6 hours before inhibition
ensued at 24 hours (Figure 2B, 2D). This phenomenon
has been reported in the literature and was attributed
to expression kinetics of DUSP5, an ERK phosphatase
regulated by ERK activation [35, 38]. VMR-resistant
BCPAP cells and BRAF-wild-type Nthy-ori 3-1 cells did
not express this oscillatory pattern (Figure 2A, 2C). The
resistant BCPAP line demonstrated only early inhibition

Figure 2: Resistant BCPAP cells do not exhibit oscillatory inhibition of phospho-ERK and have increased CRAF
dimers. (A–D) Nthy-ori 3–1, BCPAP, 8505c, and resistant BCPAP cells were subjected to 10 μM VMR for various time points and

(loading control). (E) Cytoplasmic extracts from thyroid cell lines were collected after 24 hours untreated and treated with 10 μM VMR
and analyzed by Western blot for comparison of CRAF expression. After being subjected to the same 24 hour treatment, thyroid cell lines
were collected and lysed using 1% NP-40 buffer. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-CRAF antibody, SDS-PAGE,
and Western blot analysis for CRAF.

of ERK and then remained uninhibited throughout the 48
hour treatment (Figure 2C). In contrast, normal BCPAP
demonstrated oscillatory inhibition and cells were unable
to survive treatment up to 48 hours (Figure 2B). The
difference in expression pattern of phospho-ERK in
response to VMR supports a role for ERK re-activation
in adaptive resistance. However, sensitivity to oscillatory
inhibition of phospho-ERK is not necessarily correlated
with growth inhibition. When analyzing the anaplastic
line (8505c), we found that these cells exhibit oscillatory
ERK inhibition without detrimental effect on cell growth,
suggesting pre-existing alternative signaling circuits in
these cells (Figure 2D).

of upstream membrane receptors by Western blot
(Figure 3). We found that the resistant BCPAP cells
expressed increased amounts of total HER2 compared to
susceptible BCPAP cells (Figure 3A, 3B). BCPAP cells
did not express detectable levels of HER3 protein in
this experiment and the resistant BCPAP cells expressed
relatively greater amounts. In addition, the resistant
BCPAP cells responded to 24 hour VMR treatment
by increasing phosphorylation of HER3 compared to
untreated (Figure 3C). HER3 lacks tyrosine kinase activity
itself, but becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine residues
after forming heterodimers with other ErbB proteins such
as HER2. The HER2/HER3 dimer is a potent activator
of growth signaling pathways including MAPK. An
intermediate expression level was seen in 8505c, as these
cells expressed more HER2 and HER3 compared to
BCPAP but less compared to resistant BCPAP. Expression
of EGFR, which belongs to the same protein receptor
family as HER2 and HER3, decreased slightly in the
resistant BCPAP cells compared to normal BCPAP.

Expression of receptor tyrosine kinases, HER2
and HER3, is increased in vemurafenib-resistant
BCPAP cells
To further investigate the role of feedback inhibition
release caused by VMR, we analyzed expression

Hyperactivation of ERK and resistance to
phospho-mTOR inhibition characterize in vitro
vemurafenib resistance in BCPAP cells

Resistant BCPAP are relatively resistant to
vemurafenib-mediated inhibition of phospho-S6
ribosomal protein compared to susceptible
BCPAP

Since development of resistance appeared to be
mediated through mechanisms involved in ERK signaling,
we analyzed expression of key effector molecules, ERK
and mTOR. We noted inhibition of phosphorylation
of these molecules in normal BCPAP cells in response
to 24 hour VMR treatment in a previous study [16].
When comparing expression levels of phosphorylated
signaling proteins among cell lines, we found that the
resistant BCPAP cells expressed a remarkably higher
amount of phospho-ERK compared to normal BCPAP
(Figure 4). VMR treatment decreased phospho-ERK
expression in both normal and resistant BCPAP cells,
although the detected amount of phospho-ERK in VMRtreated resistant BCPAP was still greater than was seen
in untreated BCPAP cells (Figure 4A). Resistant cells
also had higher ratios of phospho-ERK to total ERK,
indicating increased constitutive signal activation
(Figure 4B). Normal BCPAP cells demonstrated phosphomTOR inhibition and a decreased ratio of phospho-mTOR
to mTOR in response to VMR. However, the resistant
BCPAP cells expressed an equal ratio of phospho-mTOR
to total mTOR in untreated and VMR-treated samples,
indicating resistance to VMR-mediated inhibition
(Figure 4A, 4C).

Both ERK and mTOR signaling have been shown
to contribute to the activation of molecules regulating
translation, such as ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and its
downstream substrate S6 ribosomal protein [39, 40]. We
therefore investigated effects of VMR on S6 ribosomal
protein expression and its activation in our VMR-sensitive
and VMR-resistant thyroid cell lines. Results demonstrated
that VMR treatment reduced the phospho-S6 ribosomal
protein to total S6 ribosomal protein ratio more drastically
in the susceptible BCPAP compared to resistant BCPAP
(Figure 5A, 5B). Activation ratios of S6 ribosomal protein
decreased to only 0.04 relative to untreated in BCPAP and
decreased to 0.37 of the untreated ratio in resistant BCPAP,
although BCPAP expressed greater amounts of phospho-S6
ribosomal protein compared to resistant BCPAP in the
untreated samples (Figure 5A, 5B). The relative ratio of
S6 ribosomal activation after VMR treatment for 8505c
anaplastic cells was 0.23 compared to untreated, indicating
that the resistant BCPAP more effectively resisted inhibition
of phospho-S6 ribosomal protein even compared to 8505c.
The BRAF-wild-type thyroid cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) had a
slightly increased ratio of phospho-S6 ribosomal protein to
total S6 ribosomal protein after VMR treatment.

DISCUSSION

inhibition of S6 ribosomal protein activation (Figure 5)
by VMR. Investigating the capability of thyroid cancer
cells to develop resistance to targeted BRAFV600E
in vitro may lead to greater understanding of the
mechanisms available to thyroid cancer cells within
patient tumors and direct future aims to prevent or treat
resistance through combination therapies.
Our experiments involved forcing cells in culture to
adapt to increasing concentrations of the targeted inhibitor.
Although this rather short-term in vitro model of inducing
VMR resistance may be seen as a limitation, our results
exhibit concordance with prior in vitro and in vivo studies.
For example, one of the most common mechanisms
of adaptive resistance to targeted inhibitors is rebound
expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as a result
of loss of feedback inhibition from ERK [33, 41–42]. In

In this study, we characterized cellular resistance
to BRAFV600E inhibition in BCPAP papillary thyroid
cancer cells in terms of signaling proteins. A main feature
of resistant cells was hyperactivation of ERK signaling
as demonstrated most clearly by increased expression
of phospho-ERK and an increased ERK activation ratio
compared to normal BCPAP (Figure 4A, 4B). Our data
suggest that mechanisms contributing to enhanced ERK
signaling may include increased expression of upstream
HER2 and HER3 receptors (Figure 3) and formation of
CRAF dimers (Figure 2E). Such activation leads to the
signaling that bypasses BRAFV600E within this pathway.
In addition, resistant cells appeared to be less vulnerable
to inhibition of mTOR activation (Figure 4A, 4C) and

Figure 5: Resistant BCPAP cells are less sensitive to vemurafenib-mediated inhibition of phospho-S6 ribosomal
protein compared to BCPAP. (A) Cytoplasmic extracts from thyroid cell lines were collected after 24 hours +/− 10 μM VMR,

our VMR-resistant thyroid cancer cells, we observed both
increased expression of the membrane receptors HER2
and HER3 and increased activation of HER3 in response
to VMR. These results are consistent with the observation
that short-term BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment also
induced expression and activation of HER2/HER3 dimers
in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells [35]. Mechanisms
contributing to ERK activation in the presence of
pathway inhibitors are likely complex and cell-specific.
The identification of potential drug targets that are
characteristic of certain types of cancer, such as HER2/
HER3 in papillary thyroid cancer, will accelerate the
process of developing effective combination therapies. Our
study demonstrates that the creation of in vitro resistance
may be a useful tool to identify resistance molecules for
further investigation, especially if this technique is applied
more broadly and/or with incorporation of patient-derived
models.
Although RAS activity was not measured, we
predict that RAS activity increased during development
of VMR resistance as a result of the increase in HER2 and
HER3 receptors, which dimerize to potently activate RAS.
Since activated RAS promotes the dimerization of wildtype RAF proteins, our prediction agrees with the finding
of increased CRAF dimers in VMR-resistant BCPAP cells
compared to susceptible BCPAP. The formation of CRAF
dimers offers a mechanism to directly bypass the inhibited
BRAFV600E molecule and continue signaling through the
ERK pathway in a BRAFV600E-independent manner.
It is likely that BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer
cells are capable of dynamically altering expression and
signaling patterns of cellular proteins in many ways to
gain resistance to VMR. The complex interaction of ERK
and mTOR signaling in this process is of great interest and
requires further study. These two pathways are thought to
converge at the regulation of factors involved in translation
initiation. ERK signaling activates the p90 ribosomal
protein S6 kinases (RSKs) and mTOR signaling activates
ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) [41, 42]. Both RSK
and S6K phosphorylate S6 ribosomal protein, which then
interacts with tRNA, initiation factors, and mRNA [43].
S6 ribosomal protein is thought to enhance the affinity of
ribosomes for mRNAs with 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine
tracts, thus promoting translation initiation, and also
has a role in regulating cell size [42]. Interestingly,
convergence of ERK and mTOR signaling also occurs
on another factor, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4B (eIF4B). One study found that both ERK and mTOR
phosphorylate eIF4B at the same residue (Ser422),
which increases the protein’s interaction with eukaryotic
initiation factor 3 [44]. Our study shows that the VMRresistant BCPAP cells when treated with the drug had over
9-fold higher proportion of the S6 ribosomal protein in the
phosphorylated state compared to that of VMR-sensitive
BCPAP cells (Figure 5B, 0.37:0.04). The rate of protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

synthesis, thus translating to cell growth rate, was more
than 9 times less suppressed by VMR in the resistant cells
compared to in sensitive cells.
The pattern we observed in terms of activation
of S6 ribosomal protein in our VMR-resistant BCPAP
cells more closely resembles that seen with activation of
mTOR compared to activation of ERK. While ERK was
constitutively hyperactive within resistant BCPAP cells,
activation of mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein was not
increased in the resistant line, but less inhibited by VMR
treatment compared to susceptible BCPAP. It is possible
that the relatively refractory nature of S6 ribosomal protein
activation in resistant cells is mediated by both ERK and
mTOR, especially since activation of mTOR itself is
inhibited by BRAFV600E inhibition in normal BCPAP.
Hyperactive ERK may be contributing to the persistent
mTOR phenotype.
Characterization of development of resistance
also agrees with results of our prior study investigating
combination therapy using BRAFV600E and mTOR
inhibitors in thyroid cancer cells [36]. Earlier, we found
that the combination reduced cell viability in resistant
BCPAP cells. In addition, the combination had a greater
effect on VMR-sensitive BCPAP cells in that mTOR
inhibitors sensitized these cells to cytotoxic effects of
VMR. Taken together, the data suggests that proteins
capable of mediating resistance in the presence of
increasing concentrations of a targeted inhibitor may also
be indicated as targets in susceptible cells. Determining
rational targets to be inhibited in combination with existing
kinase inhibitors is a growing topic of interest due to the
potential for limiting resistance, enhancing apoptosis and/
or suspending tumor growth indefinitely. Within the RAFmutated cancers, researchers found that the combination
of sorafenib (RAF inhibitor) and flavopiridol (panCDK inhibitor) synergistically enhanced cytotoxicity in
RAS/RAF mutant breast cancer cells [45]. In addition,
treatment of sorafenib combined with the phytochemical
fisetin (PI3K inhibitor) reduced tumor growth, inhibited
proliferation and angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis in
melanoma xenografts more effectively compared to each
individual treatment [46]. Novel combination therapy is a
concept that can be applied broadly among human cancers,
is constantly evolving, and may provide a solution for
targeted inhibitor resistance.
While this study focuses on protein expression and
cell signaling within thyroid cells, research in melanoma
has identified additional means of resistance through
genetic mutation in other ERK proteins such as NRAS,
alternative splice patterns of BRAFV600E, and gene
amplification of BRAFV600E [25, 28–31]. It is possible
that genetic mutation occurred concurrently with signaling
changes in our thyroid cells. The plasticity of responses
to targeted therapy suggests that while targeting critical
signaling molecule BRAFV600E will provide immediate

resistance must be combated with multifaceted inhibition.

detected on X-ray film. All densitometry was performed
using the ImageJ program.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Thyroid cell lines used in this study include Nthyori 3-1 (immortalized normal thyroid cells), BCPAP
(papillary thyroid cancer cells), and 8505c (anaplastic
thyroid cancer cells). Dr. Norman L. Eberhardt (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN) generously gifted the Nthy-ori
3-1 cell line. BCPAP and 8505c cell lines were purchased
from DSMZ in Braunschweig, Germany. All cell lines
were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
penicillin 10,000 IU/mL, streptomycin 10,000 μg/mL, and
2 mM L-glutamine.

Resistant BCPAP cell line
VMR-resistant BCPAP cells were created by
intermittently treating BCPAP cells with increasing
concentrations of VMR (Chemietek, Indianapolis, IN).
Cells were subjected to treatment for 24 hour periods,
subcultured and allowed to grow to 70% confluence before
the next treatment. After each treatment period, a portion
of cells were collected for analysis in terms of phosphoERK expression. Resistant BCPAP cells were maintained
in culture with intermittent treatments of 16 μM VMR.

Immunoprecipitation
Thyroid cells were plated in T75 flasks and
allowed to grow until 70% confluence. Complete media
was replaced with 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBScontaining media and flasks were incubated for 24 hours.
Cells were treated for an additional 24 hours with +/–
10 μM VMR. Cells were collected by gentle scraping,
spun down, and subjected to 1% NP-40 lysis buffer
on ice for 10 minutes with periodic mixing. Samples
were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm and
4°C and supernatants were collected. GammaBind Plus
Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed 3 times
with PBS. CRAF antibody (BD Bioscience) was added
to beads and the mixture was incubated for 2 hours at
4°C with constant rotation. At the same time, 100 µg
of sample lysate was also incubated for 2 hours at 4°C
with constant rotation to pre-clear lysates. The beads
coated with antibody were washed three times with PBS
before the pre-cleared lysate was added to them. This
mixture was incubated overnight in eppendorf tubes at
4°C with constant rotation. The tubes were centrifuged
for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm and beads were washed
three times in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer. Loading buffer
was added to the samples. Samples were boiled for ten
minutes and spun down. Supernatants were subjected
to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as in
our prior studies and probed for CRAF with primary
antibody (Cell Signaling).

Alamar blue cell viability assay
Cells were plated at 4,000 cells per well in 96well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Complete
media was replaced with 100 µL phenol-red-free RPMI
containing 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS and various
concentrations of VMR including 0, 10, 100, 1000,
20000, and 50000 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for
96 hours and then 10 µL Alamar blue was added to each
well. Plates were incubated for 4 hours protected from
light before optical density was measured at 570 nm and
600 nm for control.

Western blotting
Thyroid cells were grown to 70% confluence in
T75 flasks and complete media was replaced with 5%
charcoal dextran-treated FBS-containing media for
24 hours. Cells were treated with +/– 10 μM VMR for
1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours. For whole cell lysates, cells
