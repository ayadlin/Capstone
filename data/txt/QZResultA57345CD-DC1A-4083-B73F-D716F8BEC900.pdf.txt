Abstract

Author Manuscript

Rho family GTPases control a diverse range of cellular processes, and their deregulation has been
implicated in human cancer. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind and sequester
GTPases in the cytosol, restricting their actions. RhoGDI2 is a member of the GDI family that acts
as a metastasis suppressor in a variety of cancer types; however, very little is known about the
regulation and function of this protein. Here we present a mechanism for inactivation of RhoGDI2
via PKC phosphorylation of Ser 31 in a region that contacts GTPases. In cells, RhoGDI2 becomes
rapidly phosphorylated at Ser 31 in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Based
on the effects of pharmacological inhibitors and knockdown by siRNA, we determine that
conventional type PKCα is responsible for this phosphorylation. Phospho-mimetic S31ERhoGDI2 exhibits reduced binding to Rac1 relative to wild type, with a concomitant failure to
reduce levels of activated endogenous Rac1 or remove Rac1 from membranes. These results
reveal a mechanism of down-regulation of RhoGDI2 activity through PKC mediated
phosphorylation of Ser 31. We hypothesize that this mechanism may serve to neutralize RhoGDI2
function in tumors that express RhoGDI2 and active PKCα.

cell growth, invasion and metastasis of many types of cancers (3–5). GTPases cycle between
active, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound states and inactive, guanosine diphosphate
(GDP) bound states, and the rate at which this cycle occurs is regulated by three classes of
proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activating proteins (GAPs),
and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (6).

Author Manuscript

The RhoGDI family consists of three members (RhoGDI1, 2 and 3) that bind to Rho family
GTPases, extract them from membranes, and sequester them in the cytosol, effectively
maintaining them in an inactive state and disallowing effector binding (7). GDIs are further
thought to stabilize GTPases in the cytosol, enabling them to evade degradation (8).
Importantly, both RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2 (also called LyGDI or D4GDI) have been linked
to tumorigenesis and metastasis, although their precise roles in cancer vary with tumor type
(9). For instance, RhoGDI2 expression is downregulated in several cancer types including
bladder, lung and lymphoma (10–14), but is upregulated in prostate and gastric cancer (15,
16). Further, although they share sequence similarity, RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2 appear to
carry out different functions within the same tumor type. For example, RhoGDI2 is a potent
metastasis suppressor in bladder while RhoGDI1 only weakly suppresses metastasis (17),
underscoring functional differences between RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2.

Author Manuscript

Given the role of GDIs in cancer progression, it is important to understand how these
proteins are regulated in both a normal and cancer setting. Recent identification of Tyr 153
as a Src phosphorylation site on RhoGDI2 that enhances RhoGDI2 metastasis suppressor
function in experimental lung metastasis assays of bladder cancer cells highlighted that
phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 can modulate its metastasis suppressor function (18). Given
this, we sought to identify additional post-translational modifications of RhoGDI2, and
determine whether they alter GDI function. Here we identify Ser31 in RhoGDI2 as a site
that, when phosphorylated by PKCα, inhibits RhoGDI2 function by reducing its binding to
Rac1, which leads to increased Rac1 activation and decreased cytosolic sequestration.

RESULTS
RhoGDI2 is phosphorylated in cells in response to phorbol ester treatment

Author Manuscript

Previous studies showed by 32P labeling that RhoGDI2 was phosphorylated in response to
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment of U937 human myelomonocytic cells
and Jurkat cells (19, 20), although no further analysis was performed. Because PMA is a
potent activator of the Protein Kinase C (PKC) family of enzymes, we decided to test
whether RhoGDI2 was phosphorylated by PKC. We utilized a phospho-specific PKC
substrate antibody that recognizes phosphorylated proteins with a PKC consensus sequence
([R/K]XpS[Hyd][R/K]) to assess RhoGDI2 phosphorylation in cells. We found that FLAGRhoGDI2 expressed in 293T cells was phosphorylated at a PKC site in response to PMA in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation was abolished by pre-treatment of the
cells with the pan-PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (Fig. 1A), reinforcing that this is a PKCmediated phosphorylation. PMA induced phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 was maximal within
10 minutes and persisted at an elevated level for as long as an hour (Fig. 1B). To assess the
maximum extent of this phosphorylation, we determined by immunoblotting the fraction of
total FLAG-RhoGDI2 that exhibited reduced electrophoretic mobility following PMA

treatment (Fig. 1C). We found that PMA induced phosphorylation of approximately 45% of
the RhoGDI2 protein, indicating efficient and extensive phosphorylation in response to
PMA. In order to demonstrate that endogenous RhoGDI2 also was phosphorylated in
response to PMA, endogenous RhoGDI2 was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cell extracts
and probed for phosphorylation by immunoblotting using the phospho-PKC substrate
antibody. While untreated Jurkat cells had no detectable RhoGDI2 phosphorylation, PMA
treatment induced PKC-mediated phosphorylation of endogenous RhoGDI2 (Fig. 1D).
Serine 31 is the major site of PMA mediated phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

We employed mass spectrometry to identify sites of PMA induced phosphorylation. FLAGRhoGDI2 was expressed in 293T cells treated with PMA, immunoprecipitated from cell
extracts and isolated by SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to FLAG-RhoGDI2 was
visualized by Coomassie staining, excised, and digested. Peptides were analyzed using LCMS/MS mass spectrometry. Sequence coverage spanned 92% of the protein (Fig. 2A), and
two putative phospho-sites were identified, Ser20 and Ser31 (Fig. 2B). We made
substitution mutants of both sites to alanine, S20A- and S31A-RhoGDI2, and assayed their
phosphorylation by PKC in 293T cells in response to PMA treatment. Mutation of Ser 31 to
Ala completely abolished PMA induced phosphorylation, while mutation of Ser 20 to Ala
had no effect on phosphorylation (Fig. 2C), indicating that Ser 31 is the major site of PMA
induced phosphorylation in RhoGDI2. The results with wild type and S31A-RhoGDI2 were
replicated in UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells (Fig. 2D).
PKCα phosphorylates RhoGDI2

We next wanted to identify the PKC isoform/s responsible for PMA induced Ser 31
phosphorylation in RhoGDI2. As a first approach, we pretreated 293T cells with either the
pan-PKC inhibitor GF 109203X or the compound Gö 6976 that preferentially inhibits the
conventional type PKC isoforms (PKCα, β, or γ). Both compounds abolished PMA induced
phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 (Fig. 3A), indicating that one of the conventional PKCs may
be responsible for RhoGDI2 phosphorylation. PKCγ expression is primarily but not
exclusively restricted to neurons (21) and was not detected in 293T cells (22), so we
concluded that either PKCα or PKCβ likely was responsible for RhoGDI2 phosphorylation.
We used a SmartPool of siRNA oligos to knock down PKCα in UMUC3 bladder cells that
were stably expressing FLAG-RhoGDI2. These cells were utilized because the effects of
expressing RhoGDI2 in this cell type are well characterized (17, 18), and we have found
they express high levels of PKCα relative to non-tumorigenic bladder cell lines (E.M. Griner
and D. Theodorescu, unpublished observations). Knock down of PKCα was effective based
on reduction in immunoblotting intensity and did not alter expression levels of PKCβ (Fig.
3B). Selective depletion of PKCα reduced PMA induced RhoGDI2 phosphorylation by over
70% (Fig. 3C) indicating that PKCα is the predominant PKC isoform involved in PMA
mediated RhoGDI2 phosphorylation in these cells. We alternatively employed a single
siRNA to knock down PKCα and observed a similar reduction in RhoGDI2 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 1A).
To complement these data, we utilized a plasmid encoding myristoylated PKCα (MyrPKCα) that is targeted to membranes as a highly active form of PKCα (23). Expression of

Myr-PKCα in 293T cells increased both basal and PMA stimulated levels of RhoGDI2
phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). Further, this enhanced phosphorylation was specific for Ser31, as
the S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant was not phosphorylated in the presence of Myr-PKCα (Fig.
3D). Next, in vitro kinase assays were performed to determine if PKCα directly
phosphorylated RhoGDI2. FLAG-RhoGDI2 was immunoprecipitated from untreated 293T
cells, incubated with purified recombinant PKCα in vitro, and assessed for phosphorylation
of Ser31 by Western blotting. Addition of recombinant PKCα to the assays led to robust
phosphorylation of RhoGDI2, which was blocked entirely by the addition of the PKC
inhibitor GF 109203X to the reaction (Fig. 3E). The S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant was not
phosphorylated by PKCα in vitro (Fig. 3E) confirming that Ser31 was the site of PKCα
mediated phosphorylation both in vitro and in cells. Together these data identified PKCα as
the predominant PKC isoform responsible for PMA stimulated RhoGDI2 phosphorylation at
Ser31.

Phospho-mimetic S31E-RhoGDI2 has reduced binding to Rac1

Author Manuscript

The major function of GDIs is to bind to small GTPases; therefore, we sought to determine
the effect of Ser 31 phosphorylation on GTPase binding. As a first approach, we examined
the three dimensional structure of RhoGDI2 bound to Rac2 (24). In this structure, residues
32–52 of the N-terminal portion of RhoGDI2 form a helix-loop-helix (helical hairpin) motif
that is essential for Rac binding (Fig. 4A boxed region). This motif binds to the switch I and
II regions of Rac and this interaction is further strengthened by contacts formed between
residues 22–31 of RhoGDI2 and Rac (24). As seen in Fig. 4A, the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser
31 caps the first turn of the helical hairpin motif and forms two hydrogen bonds with Glu 34.
Addition of a negatively charged phosphate group at Ser 31 would be expected to both
eliminate stabilizing bonds and repel the negatively charged Glu 34 in the RhoGDI2 helical
hairpin and ultimately lead to decreased binding affinity for Rac.

Author Manuscript

Given our structure-based predictions, we chose to assess the ability of RhoGDI2 Ser31
mutants to bind to Rac1, the major binding partner of RhoGDI2 (18). To do this we
generated a phospho-mimetic mutant, S31E-RhoGDI2, and co-expressed it or wild type
RhoGDI2 in 293T cells with HA-tagged Rac1. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using an
anti-HA antibody and the amount of FLAG-RhoGDI2 that co-immunoprecipitated with
Rac1 was analyzed by immunoblotting. While WT-RhoGDI2 effectively coimmunoprecipitated with Rac1, the levels of co-precipitated S31E-RhoGDI2 were lower
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that the phospho-mimetic mutant has a reduced affinity for Rac1.
Interestingly, the S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant also showed slightly reduced levels of
immunoprecipitation with Rac1 that was significantly different from WT, but not reduced to
the same extent as that for S31E-RhoGDI2. Loss of the polar hydroxyl group of Ser 31 by
mutation to Ala would eliminate the two stabilizing bonds capping helix 1 and likely
decrease the stability of the helical hairpin motif (Fig. 4A) at the Rac-RhoGDI2 interface.
As a control, we performed the same set of experiments with S20A- and S20E-RhoGDI2.
Neither the phospho-mimetic nor the non-phosphorylatable Ser 20 mutants showed
significant changes in Rac1 binding relative to wild type (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We
concluded that phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 at Ser 31 disrupts binding to Rac1.

From these data, we hypothesized that PMA treatment of cells would increase RhoGDI2
phosphorylation and therefore decrease the amount of RhoGDI2 bound to Rac1.
Interestingly, we did not see a decrease in the amount of FLAG-RhoGDI2 that coimmunoprecipitated with HA-Rac1 after PMA treatment of cells (Fig. 4C). As controls, cells
expressing RhoGDI2 were treated with PMA and RhoGDI2 immunoprecipitated using antiFLAG antibody. While robust phosphorylation of the cellular pool of RhoGDI2 was seen in
response to PMA treatment, no phosphorylation was detected in the RhoGDI2 that coimmunoprecipitated with Rac1, even when similar amounts of RhoGDI2 were compared in
the Western blot (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that the non-phosphorylated form of
RhoGDI2 preferentially binds to Rac1.

Author Manuscript

We immunoprecipitated endogenous RhoGDI2 from Jurkat cells with and without PMA
stimulation. At this time point and concentration RhoGDI2 is effectively phosphorylated in
response to PMA stimulation (Fig. 1D), We assayed by Western blot the amount of
endogenous Rac1 co-immunoprecipitating with RhoGDI2, and found that PMA stimulation
caused an approximately 30% decrease in Rac1 levels (Fig. 4D). These results show effects
of PMA stimulation on Rac1 and RhoGDI2 binding, and agree with others who have
previously reported that Rac1 is activated under these conditions (25).
S31E-RhoGDI2 has decreased activity as a Rac1 GDI protein

Author Manuscript

Knowing that S31E-RhoGDI2 has impaired ability to bind to Rac1, we surmised that S31ERhoGDI2 also would be ineffective at reducing Rac1 activation. We assayed levels of
activated endogenous Rac1 in 293T cells utilizing GST-Pak-Rac/Cdc42 (p21) binding
domain (PBD) pull-down assays. Expression of WT-RhoGDI2 effectively reduced levels of
activated Rac1 in cells, and the S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant behaved similarly to WT-RhoGDI2
(Fig. 5A). This is in keeping with the observation that under these conditions, RhoGDI2
exists largely in the unphosphorylated form that binds to Rac1 (Fig. 4C, non-stimulated
cells). In contrast, S31E-RhoGDI2 had no effect on levels of active Rac1 compared to
control cells, indicating that this mutant has diminished GDI function, most likely due to its
reduced binding to Rac1 (Fig. 5A).

Author Manuscript

We also assayed for the ability of WT RhoGDI2 and the Ser 31 mutants to extract Rac1
from the membrane. While WT-RhoGDI2 effectively decreased levels of Rac1 found in the
membrane fraction, the S31E-RhoGDI2 mutant failed to change Rac1 membrane
distribution in comparison to control cells (Fig. 5B), further showing that S31E-RhoGDI2
has reduced binding to Rac1 and impaired GDI function. Interestingly, the S31A-RhoGDI2
mutant also did not significantly reduce Rac1 levels at the membrane, although it did trend
towards reduced Rac1 in the membrane. Altogether these data suggest that RhoGDI2
phosphorylated at Ser 31 has impaired GDI function.

DISCUSSION
Here we identify Ser 31 as a phosphorylation site in RhoGDI2 that is induced by PMA
treatment of cells, and we show that the conventional type PKCα is the predominant kinase
involved in this phosphorylation. Comparison of the S31E-RhoGDI2 phospho-mimetic
mutant to wild type RhoGDI2 revealed reduced Rac1 binding, an increase in Rac1

activation, and an inability to extract Rac1 from membranes. The results suggest PKC
phosphorylation is a potential mechanism to inactivate the RhoGDI2 metastasis suppressor
protein.

Structures of RhoGDI1 or RhoGDI2 bound to Rac identified two highly similar regions of
RhoGDIs: a structurally stable C-terminal immunoglobulin like domain that binds the
isoprenyl tail of GTPases, and a flexible N-terminal regulatory region consisting of a helical
hairpin that binds to the switch I and II regions of Rac2 and inhibits GDP dissociation
through stabilization of Mg+2 binding of switch I (24, 26, 27). The N-terminal region of the
GDIs is essential for GTPase binding, as truncation of the first 41 residues disrupts protein
structure and results in a loss of function (26). Ser 31 of RhoGDI2 is found in the N-terminal
region of the protein and caps the first helix of the helical hairpin structure (24). The Ser 31
residue is conserved among all members of the RhoGDI family. Interestingly, the
corresponding site in RhoGDI1 (Ser 34) has been identified as a substrate for conventional
PKCs; however, Ser 34 RhoGDI1 phosphorylation led to a selective decrease in binding to
RhoA, but not to Rac or Cdc42 (28). While these results suggest that both RhoGDI1 and
RhoGDI2 are regulated by PKCs, phosphorylation does not produce identical effects on how
different GDIs interact with Rho family GTPases. The mechanism through which this occurs
is unclear, but may be related to the different binding affinities RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2
have for GTPases.

Author Manuscript

Our analysis of the RhoGDI2-Rac2 complex indicates that the Ser 31 hydroxyl group of
RhoGDI2 is involved in two hydrogen bonds with Glu 34 that form a cap at the N-terminus
of helix 1 (Fig. 4A). Because Ser 31 interacts with an acidic side chain, phosphorylation or
substitution of Ser 31 with an acidic residue would cause electrostatic repulsion in addition
to the loss of the stabilizing hydrogen bonds, and would be expected to disrupt RhoGDI2
structure and decrease its interactions with Rac. Furthermore, the residues surrounding Ser
31 make important contacts with Rac (24, 26), and it is foreseeable that phosphorylation of
Ser31 could also disrupt these contacts and further interfere with GTPase binding. NMR
studies of RhoGDI1 or RhoGDI2 showed that the N-terminal 60 residues of the proteins
were flexible and disordered when free in solution, but became ordered and formed a helical
hairpin structure upon addition of Rac (26, 27). This model suggests that the N-terminal
region of RhoGDI2 exists in an equilibrium between a disordered state and an ordered state,
and that binding of RhoGDIs to a GTPase stabilizes the ordered state and the helical hairpin
structure that is essential for GTPase binding (26). From this model and our data presented
here, we propose that phosphorylation of Ser 31 drives RhoGDI2 towards an unstructured
form and prevents binding of RhoGDI2 to a GTPase.

Author Manuscript

While results obtained with the S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant vary, they are generally consistent
with our structural analysis, and our proposed model of RhoGDI2 regulation by Ser 31
phosphorylation predicts the relative severity of the deficiencies caused by the amino acid
substitutions or Ser 31 phosphorylation. Substitution of Ser 31 to Ala would eliminate the
Ser 31 hydroxyl group hydrogen bonding with Glu 34 and would destabilize the protein and
its interactions with Rac, although not to as great of an extent as phosphorylation of Ser 31
or mutation to an acidic residue. Thus, when viewed in terms of the equilibrium between an
ordered and disordered state, mutation of Ser 31 to Ala would slightly shift the equilibrium

towards a more disordered state. This could explain the intermediate effect of S31ARhoGDI2 on Rac1 binding (Fig. 4B). The effect of S31A-RhoGDI2 expression on Rac1
membrane distribution (Fig. 5B) also trends toward an intermediate effect between that of
WT and S31E-RhoGDI2, although the effect of S31A-RhoGDI2 is not statistically
significant from either WT or S31E-RhoGDI2 in this assay. On the other hand, Rac1
activation levels in the presence of S31A-RhoGDI2 are decreased to a similar extent as in
samples expressing WT RhoGDI2 (Fig. 5A). While binding to Rac1 is decreased in the
S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant, it does still bind to Rac1, and this seems to be enough to depress
Rac1 activation levels. It stands to reason that the S31A-RhoGDI2 mutant would behave
similarly to WT RhoGDI2 in Rac1 activation assays given that WT RhoGDI2 is largely
unphosphorylated in unstimulated cells (See Fig. 4C, non-stimulated cells).

While several phosphorylation sites have been identified on RhoGDI1, only one other major
phosphorylation site in RhoGDI2, Tyr 153, was identified prior to this work. Similar to Ser
31 phosphorylation, Src mediated phosphorylation of Tyr 153 results in decreased Rac1
binding and inability of RhoGDI2 to extract Rac1 from membranes. Because Tyr153 and
Ser31 are in different structural domains of RhoGDI2, we imagine that even though
phosphorylation reduces Rac1 binding in each case, it probably does so via different
mechanisms. Interestingly, the phospho-mimetic Y153E-RhoGDI2 mutant has enhanced
metastasis suppressor function in experimental lung metastasis assays of bladder cancer cells
(18), indicating that Src phosphorylation at Tyr 153 is a means of positively regulating
RhoGDI2 metastasis suppressor function in bladder. The mechanisms through which this
occurs are unclear, but thought to be related to the redistribution of RhoGDI2 to membranes,
occuring upon Tyr 153 phosphorylation. This is in contrast to Ser 31 phosphorylation, which
does not appear to redistribute the protein as the majority of the S31E-RhoGDI2 phosphomimetic mutant remains in the cytosol (Fig. 5B).

Author Manuscript

Given the effect of Tyr 153 on RhoGDI2 function, it is clear that phosphorylation of
RhoGDI2 is an important mechanism to modulate its metastasis suppressor function. It is
intriguing to speculate that PKCα mediated Ser 31 phosphorylation may also play a role in
modulating RhoGDI2 metastasis suppression. Interestingly, PKCα protein levels have been
shown to increase in bladder cancer with increasing tumor grade (29), and PKCα was found
to be more active in transitional cell carcinomas of bladder when compared to adjacent
normal tissue (30). Further, studies using pharmacological inihibition of conventional PKCs
have shown that PKC α or β can enhance migration, invasion and cell growth of bladder
cancer cells (31, 32), altogether suggesting that PKCα may be pro-tumorigenic, although
extensive work remains to verify this. Thus, PKCα phosphorylation at Ser31 of RhoGDI2
may be an alternate means of modulating RhoGDI2 metastasis suppressor activity in tumor
cells. Experiments to test this hypothesis will be the subject of future work.

The LC-MS system consisted of a Finnigan LTQ-FT mass spectrometer system with a
