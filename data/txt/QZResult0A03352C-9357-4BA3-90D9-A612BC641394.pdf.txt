ABSTRACT
The aim of our study was to investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve
as predictive biomarkers to anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab, panitumumab) in patients
with RAS wild-type (wt-RAS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Historical cohort of 93
patients with mCRC (2006–2009) was included and further divided into exploratory and
validation cohorts. MiRNAs expression profiling was performed on the exploratory cohort
of 41 wt-KRAS mCRC patients treated with cetuximab to identify miRNAs associated with
time to progression (TTP). The validation was performed on two independent cohorts: 28
patients of wt-RAS mCRC treated with cetuximab and 24 patients of wt-RAS mCRC treated
with panitumumab. We identified 9 miRNAs with significantly different expression between
responders and non-responders to cetuximab therapy (P ≤ 0.01). These 9 miRNAs were
further evaluated in two independent cohorts of patients and miR-31-3p (P < 0.001) and
miR-31-5p (P < 0.001) were successfully confirmed as strongly associated with TTP in
wt-RAS mCRC patients treated with cetuximab but not panitumumab. When evaluated
on the complete cohort of cetuximab patients (N = 69), miR-31-3p (HR, 5.10; 95% CI,
2.52–10.32; P < 0.001) and miR-31-5p (HR, 4.80; 95% CI, 2.50–9.24; P < 0.001) were
correlated with TTP on the comparable level of significance. There was no difference in miR31-5p/3p expression levels in RAS mutated and wild-type tumor samples. MiR-31-5p/3p
are promising predictive biomarkers of cetuximab response in wt-RAS mCRC patients.

39% of colorectal cancers are diagnosed at an early, localized
stage, mainly because of underuse of screening options [2].
New therapeutic options for metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC) patients, including therapy with cetuximab
and panitumumab antibodies targeting epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), have improved patient survival.
Anti-EGFR therapy was historically indicated only to
mCRC patients with KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) tumors,
whereas these tumors presents approximately 60% of all
mCRC cases [3]. However, only 35–40% of these wtKRAS patients have clinical benefit from anti-EGFR

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the most
frequent malignant neoplasms and a leading cause of cancer
related deaths in developed world. The global incidence is
about 1.23 million, which is 9.7% of all cancers diagnosed
worldwide [1]. Whereas 5-year survival is demonstrated in
90% patients with colorectal cancers diagnosed at an early
stage, in metastatic disease it is only 12% of patients who have
the 5-year survival. Worth of attention is also the fact that only

treatment [4]. To avoid exposing of non-responding
patients to ineffective, possibly harmful and expensive
therapy, great effort has been made to identify new
predictive biomarkers of anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibodies and finally NRAS and novel KRAS mutations
were identified to be also correlated with lack of response
[5, 6]. Introduction of testing for NRAS and rare KRAS
mutations into clinical routine increased power of response
prediction, but frequency of these mutations is not high
enough to improve overall response rate in mCRC as
requested and there is still a large proportion of patients
who do not receive benefit from this treatment [5].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short 18 to 25 nucleotides
long, non-coding single stranded RNAs, represent
regulatory network that regulate more than half of all
human coding genes on post-transcription level. They
are implicated in cancer biology and act as oncogenes or
tumour-suppressor and their deregulation can lead to the
development of a wide range of solid tumors including
CRC. Antibody immune responses and EGFR pathway
and its signaling components were shown to be directly
regulated by miRNAs [7]. There are also two recent
reports indicating involvement of miRNAs in sensitivity
of mCRC to anti-EGFR therapy [8, 9].
The aim of this study was to identify and validate
miRNAs whose expression could help to predict time
to progression (TTP) and response to cetuximab and/or
panitumumab in wt-RAS mCRC patients.

the most significantly downregulated miRNAs in NR/R
(P ≤ 0. 01) were miR 378a-5p (FC = 6.689), miR-192-5p
(FC = 1.881), miR-455-5p (FC = 5.019) and miR-30a-3p
(FC = 4.499) (Table 2).

MiR-31-5p/3p are associated with TPP in
patients treated with cetuximab (validation
cohort 1)
Validation was performed on the validation cohort 1
(N = 28) consisted of patients treated with cetuximab.
From the nine validated miRNAs, only miR-31-5p and
miR-31-3p were confirmed to be significantly associated
with TTP in patients treated with cetuximab (P ≤ 0.001)
(Table 3). Based on the cut-off values of normalized
miRNA expressions determined by ROC analysis, we
divided patients into two groups (with low and with high
miRNA expression). Patients with high-level of miR31-5p had TTP median of 16 weeks, with low-level 49
weeks (P < 0.001, adjusted HR 7.369, 95% CI 2.242 to
24.219). For miR-31-3p it was 16 vs. 49 weeks (P < 0.001,
adjusted HR 35.051, 95% CI 6.887 to 178.412) (Table 3),
(Figure 2). MiR-31-5p/3p showed strong association with
response to cetuximab therapy, also when their predictive
potential was evaluated on the complete set of cetuximab
patients, containing both – exploratory and validation
cohort 1 patients (N = 69). Median TTP in the group of
patients with high expression of miR-31-3p was 14 vs. 44
weeks in the group of patients with low expression of this
miRNA (P < 0.0001, HR 5.099, 95%CI 2.520 to 10.317).
Median TTP in the group of patients with high expression
of miR-31-5p was 14 vs. 45 weeks in the miR-31-5p-low
expression-group (P < 0.0001, HR 4.803, 95%CI 2.497 to
9.242), (Table 4), (Figure 2). MiR-31-5p was successfully
validated also as associated to objective therapy response
defined accordingly to RECIST criteria (Supplementary
Table S1). When compared in FFPE tumor samples with or
without mutations, miR-31-5p/3p expression levels were
found not to be associated with KRAS/NRAS mutational
status (P = 0.901 and P = 0.813, respectively).

RESULTS
MiRNA signature associated with response
to cetuximab (exploratory cohort)
Nine miRNAs are differentially expressed in
responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to cetuximab
therapy. To identify miRNAs with the significantly
different expression in FFPE tumor samples of nonresponders (TTP shorter than 25 weeks) and responders
(TTP longer than 25 weeks), we analysed expression
profiles of 723 miRNAs in 20 samples from nonresponders and 21 samples from responders to cetuximab
(Table 1). Using criterion P ≤ 0.01 at moderated t-test we
identified 9 miRNAs that were used for cluster analysis
(miR-31-5p, miR-31-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-378a-5p, miR30a-3p, miR-455-5p, miR-636, miR-32-3p, miR-595).
Based on a cluster analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were evaluated comparing TTP between patients in the
cluster 1 (N = 14) and cluster 2 (N = 27). Median TTP
in cluster 1 was 55 weeks, median TTP in cluster 2 was
12 weeks (Figure 1). The most significantly upregulated
miRNAs in non-responders compared to responders
(P ≤ 0. 01) were miR-31-5p (Fold Change, FC = 14.746),
miR-31-3p (FC = 6.747), miR-595 (FC = 5.555), miR636 (FC = 2.95) and miR-32-3p (FC = 6.732). Oppositely,

To determine whether it is possible to use miRNAs
associated with TTP in patients treated with cetuximab
also in patients undergoing therapy with different antiEGFR monoclonal antibody- panitumumab, independent
validation was performed on the validation set 2, which
is consisted only of patients treated with panitumumab
(N = 24). The validation of miR-31-5p/3p expression
levels using qRT-PCR method was performed identically
to validation performed in cetuximab validation
cohort 1. We observed, that there is no association

(miR-31-5p mimic vs. mimic negative control) and 148
genes were found to be significantly downregulated (P <

DISCUSSION

MiR-31-5p targets in CRC cells

By use of miRNA profiling we identified 9 miRNAs
(miR-31-5p, miR-31-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-378a-5p, miR30a-3p, miR-455-5p, miR-636, miR-32-3p, miR-595)

reliable for diagnostic purposes. Because miR-31-5p is the
leading strand of miR-31, we hypothesize, that miR-315p is responsible for major effects caused by miR-31 and
miR-31-3p (passenger strand), which occurs in very low
level is just reflecting changes in expression of miR-31
without significant functional consequences. Advantage of
less expressed miR-31-3p could be its potentially higher
sensitivity to modifications. But finally we suggest usage
of miR-31-5p instead of −3p for potential application as
predictive biomarker of response to cetuximab in mCRC
patients. Although, in our study, we decided to define
response on the basis of TTP interval (TTP > 25 weeks
for responders, TTP < 25 for non-responders) instead of
objective response evaluated by RECIST as done by other
authors before (8, 13–16), in case of miR-31-5p we have
successfully validated also its association with objective
response (Supplementary Table S1).
When compared to very recent study published by
Manceau et al. [8] and Mosakhani et al. [9], who identified
miR-31-3p (not miR-31-5p) as miRNA associated with
response to anti-EGFR therapy, in our study, miR-313p/5p were connected with response to cetuximab at
higher level of significance (P < 0.0001). Based on miR31-3p/5p expression levels, median TPP was 14 weeks for
non-responders and 44–45 weeks for responders. This TTP
interval (14 weeks) for patients with high levels of miR31-5p/3p is comparable to median TTP in mCRC patients
treated with anti-EGFR therapy carrying mutated variant
of KRAS (patients who accordingly to recent guidelines
are not indicated to receive anti-EGFR therapy), which
ranges from 7.4 weeks to 3 months [13–16].
Moreover, based on miR-31-3p or miR-31-5p
expression levels we were able to discriminate 34%,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

respectively 40% of patients with wt-RAS status who
could be considered as non-responders beside RAS
mutated patients. Wt-RAS status is manifested in 60% of
mCRC patients [17]. The combination of RAS mutational
status with miR-31-5p/3p expression levels could be in
this respect powerful tool for identification of patients
who are more likely to respond to cetuximab therapy.
Further, we have evaluated expression levels of miR-315p/3p in independent recent group of KRAS/NRAS wildtype and KRAS/NRAS mutant group of mCRC patients
and observed no difference between groups indicating
that there is no relationship between miR-31-5p/3p and
mutational status of KRAS/NRAS.
Based on these findings we decided to evaluate
predictive potential of miR-31-5p/3p also in the validation
cohort 2 consisted of mCRC patients treated with
another anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, panitumumab.
Interestingly, we have found no association between
miR-31-5p/3p levels and response to panitumumab,
which is partially in contrast with previous studies [8, 9],
which were based on mCRC patients treated with both,
cetuximab or panitumumab, and patients were not stratified
accordingly to specific monoclonal antibody. Mosakhani
et al. [9] found significantly higher expression levels of
miR-31-3p (P < 0.01) in tumors of RECIST-based nonresponders to anti-EGFR therapy. Manceau et al. [8] found
the link between miR-31-3p expression and progressionfree survival (PFS) and defined formula to count PFS
risk score (P = 0.012) applicable for both anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibodies - cetuximab and panitumumab.
We are the first to show that miR-31-3p as well as
miR-31-5p should not be used as a predictor of response
to panitumumab. There are two potential explanations for

predictive role of miR-31-5p/3p specifically for cetuximab:
one associated with concomitant chemotherapy, second
with different immune response linked to cetuximab and
panitumumab antibodies. In our cohort, cetuximab was
typically administered with concomitant chemotherapy
(mainly irinotecan based regimens), whereas panitumumab
was administered in monotherapy. From this perspective, is
seems that miR-31-5p/3p could associated more probably
with irinotecan then cetuximab response. Moreover,
there is an increasing evidence describing link between
chemotherapy and miRNAs regulatory network [10, 11]
indicating miRNAs involvement in chemosensitivity
or chemoresistance [12]. On other hand, this evidence
did not show any specific associations of miR-31-5p/3p
and chemosensitivity, even in case of topoisomerase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitors like irinotecan (10–12). In order to understand
more our findings and figure out the role of miR-31-5p
in response to cetuximab therapy, we performed in vitro
study to identify mRNA targets of miR-31-5p in CRC.
By use of three CRC cell lines and Affymetrix wholegenome expression profiling we found 148 genes to be
significantly downregulated and 84 genes upregulated
after transfection of the cell lines with miR-31-5p mimic.
In consequent GeneOntology analysis, we observed that
16 of genes that are putatively targeted by miR-31-5p
are involved in immune system processes, 7 genes are
involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and
4 in chemokine signaling pathway. Since panitumumab
is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) and is
associated with different immune responses in comparison

to antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity induced by
chimeric monoclonal antibody cetuximab (IgG1), we
hypothesize, that specific predictive value of miR-31-5p/3p
in cetuximab therapy is associated with specific immune
response induced by cetuximab but not panitumumab.
Our study has also several limitations, which
should be discussed. In the historical cohort of mCRC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients used for miRNA profiling (exploratory phase of
the study) NRAS mutational status and information about
rare KRAS mutation is not available. Unfortunately, there
was no more tissue or DNA to be used for additional
mutational analysis. Therefore, some of the cases
analyzed in exploratory phase could have mutated
RAS. Based on sequencing analysis of the independent
38701

Oncotarget

validation cohorts we estimate approx. 5% mutated cases
could be included in exploratory cohort by mistake. We
believe, however, that this limitation is overcomed by the
fact that KRAS and NRAS in tumors, which were planned
to be enrolled in the validation cohorts, were sequenced
and only KRAS/NRAS wild-type cases were included.
Another limitation is the number of miRNAs, which
were profiled by use of Agilent microarrays, which were
developed on the basis of miRBase database release 10.1.
The current release of miRBase is 21 and the number
of miRNAs there is more than two-times higher than in
10.1. Although newly discovered miRNAs are usually
expressed under very specific conditions, at very low
levels, and in the majority of tissues are not present
at all, based on that our profiling approach can not be
considered as global. Also the sample size of validation
cohorts, especially panitumumab cohort, is not sufficient
to obtain significant statistical power. Further validation
of the newly identified biomarkers in larger independent
populations is therefore necessary.
Our study suggests that miR-31-5p/3p could serve as
new biomarkers enabling identification of mCRC patients
with wt-KRAS who are more likely to have shorter TTP
and not respond to cetuximab therapy. This approach may
significantly decrease (around 40% of wt-RAS mCRC

therapy with no clinical benefit and enable wasteless
indication of potentially effective therapy.

and Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System accordingly to
manufacturer’s recommendations. Independent validation
cohort 1 (N = 28) consisted of 16 responders and
12 non-responders to cetuximab therapy and was used for
the validation of results reached in exploratory phase of
the study. Subsequently, samples from exploratory and
validation cohort 1 were analyzed together (N = 69) to
evaluate predictive potential of miRNAs, which were
confirmed on the validation set 1 to be associated with
therapy response. Validation cohort 2 (N = 24) consisted
of 14 non-responders and 10 responders to panitumumab
therapy. To evaluate correlation between RAS mutational
status and expression levels of novel miRNA biomarkers
another 10 RAS mutated and 30 RAS wild-type historical
mCRC tumors were used in the study (Masaryk Memorial
Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic) to enable these
supportive data for our concept. Informed consent
approved by the local Ethical Committee was obtained
from each patient before the treatment. Clinical data were
obtained from the patient’s medical records.

FFPE sample processing and RNA isolation

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The tissue samples were surgically resected and
fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded. Samples were
digested with Proteinase K at 55°C overnight and then
total RNA enriched with miRNAs was isolated using
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas,
USA). RNA concentration and purity were determined
spectrophotometrically (A260:A280 > 2.0; A260:A230 >
1.8) using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Patient cohorts

MiRNA profiling

Historical cohort of mCRC patients with available
formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples
were divided into three cohorts (Table 1). Patients with
mCRC involved in our study were treated with cetuximab
(Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech
Republic) / panitumumab (Faculty Hospital, Hradec
Kralove, Czech Republic) and received the first dose
between years 2005 and 2010. Detailed information
about therapeutic regimens is summarized in Table 1.
In the exploratory cohort (N = 41), KRAS mutational
status was routinely tested by use of TheraScreen:K-RAS
mutation kit (DXS Diagnostic Innovations) and therefore
information about NRAS mutational status and rare KRAS
mutations is not known. Patients with time to progression
(TTP) longer than 25 weeks were considered as responders
and patients with TTP shorter than 25 weeks as nonresponders to anti-EGFR therapy. Based on this criterion
twenty-one patients were responders and twenty patients
non-responders to cetuximab and these to groups were
compared in miRNA profiling study. For the independent
validation were used only cases proved to have wild-type
KRAS and NRAS genes, which was tested by Illumina
Tumor TruSight Sequencing Panel (Illumina Inc., USA)

MiRNA profiling based on direct hybridization
without sample amplification was performed on the set of
21 responders and 20 non-responders FFPE tissue samples
using Agilent MiRNA MicroArrays (#G4470B; Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). These microarrays
consist of 60-mer DNA probes synthesized in situ and contain
15.000 features which represent 723 human miRNAs,
sourced from the Sanger miRBASE database (Release
10.1). RNA labeling and hybridization were performed
in accordance to manufacturer’s indications. Agilent
scanner and the Feature Extraction 10.5 software (Agilent
Technologies) were used to obtain the microarray raw-data.
Data transformation was applied to set all the negative raw
values at 1.0, followed by a Quantile normalization and log2
transformation. Filters on gene expression were used to keep
only the miRNAs expressed in at least one sample.

amplification. cDNA was synthesized using TaqMan®
MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit with stem-loop
RT-microRNA-specific primers (#4366597, Applied
Biosystems, USA) according to the TaqMan MicroRNA
Assay protocol (Applied Biosystems). Real Time PCR
was performed using the Applied Biosystem 7500
Sequence Deteciton System, TaqMan® Universal Master
Mix (#4440040, Applied Biosystems, USA) and TaqMan®
microRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Threshold cycle (CT)
values were calculated by SDS 2.0.1 software (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA) using the manual threshold
settings 0.2. MiRNAs expression levels were normalized
to the expression level of miR-1233, which was used as
endogenous control. MiR-1233 was selected as reference
gene through combination of GeneNorm and NormFinder
algorithms. 2− ΔCT method was applied to determine relative
miRNA expression levels, where ΔCTs were calculated by
following formula: ΔCT = CT(miRNA of interest) − CT(miR-1233).

from transfected cells by use of mirVana miRNA Isolation
Kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA). Total RNA purity was
determined using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific,
USA), (A260:A280 > 2.0; A260:A230 > 2). RNA integrity
was evaluated using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, USA).
Two hundred and fifty ng of total RNA were used for
GeneChip® Whole Transcript (WT) Expression Arrays
(Affymetrix) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
cDNA was hybridized to GeneChip human Gene 2.0
ST (Affymetrix) at 45°C for 16 hours. Subsequently,
GeneChips were washed and scanned (GeneChip® Scanner
3000 7G, Affymetrix). The whole-genome expression data,
Affymetrix raw data (.cel files), were normalized using the
robust multichip average (RMA) algorithm from ‘oligo’
Bioconductor package in R version 3.0.1.

Statistical analysis
Agilent Human miRNA microarray results were
analyzed using the GeneSpring GX 12 software (Agilent
Technologies). Differentially expressed miRNAs were
identified by comparing non-responders (N = 20) and
responders (N = 21) defined in Patient cohorts. A 1.5 foldchange (FC) filter and the moderated t-test, with P < 0.01
and 10% false discovery rate (FDR), were applied.
Differentially expressed genes were employed in cluster
analysis, using the Pearson’s correlation as a measure
of similarity and centroid linkage. Microarray data are
deposited at ArrayExpress database under accession
number E-MTAB-3548.
Normalized miRNA expression data reached
by qPCR analysis in validation phase of the study
were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Prism Software, Inc.). Kaplan-Maier survival
analysis were performed to evaluate the correlation
between the normalized miRNAs expression levels and
TTP of the patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy.
Results with P ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant. Cut-off values for Kaplan-Maier survival
analysis were determined by ROC curve analysis, which
were based on a correlation between patients response
to anti-EGFR therapy and normalized expression level
of each of validated miRNA. Patients with TTP longer
than 25 weeks were considered responders to anti-EGFR
therapy, patients with TTP shorter than 25 weeks were
non-responders.
The whole-genome expression data were analysed
by use of Bioconductor package in R version 3.0.1. The
LIMMA package was used to identify differentially
expressed genes in cell lines with increased levels of
miR-31-5p. Obtained p-values were adjusted for multiple
testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
GeneOntology (http://www.geneontology.org/) was used
for annotation and functional categorization of the genes
identified with P < 0.05 adjusted as cut-off value.

Cell culture and transfection with miR-31-5p
mimic
Three colorectal carcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29 and DLD-1) obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used for cell
culture studies. The authentication of the cells has been
provided using the short tandem repeat profiling method
(Generi Biotech, Ltd., Czech Republic). Cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with Fetal Bovine serum (10%),
100 μg ml− 1 penicillin, 100 μg ml− 1 streptomycin, 0.1 mM
nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM
sodium pyruvate (all purchased from Invitrogen, Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell lines were incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2. All cell lines were transfected with miRVana
miRNA (Ambion) mimic negative control or hsa-miR31-5p miRVana miRNA mimic. Transfections were done
with 2.5 μl lipofectamine RNAiMAX using 5 μM MiRNA
mimic and 1000.000 HCT-116 cells, 1400.000 DLD-1
cells and 2000.000 HT-29 cells in a 6 wells plate. Cells
were harvested 48 hours after transfection. QIAzol lysis
Reagent (Qiagen) was used and RNA was isolated using
Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. The efficacy of the transfection
was assessed using TaqMan miRNA expression assay for
miR-31-5p and RNU-48 as a reference gene.

Whole-genome expression profiling
of transfected cell lines
Whole-genome expression profiling was performed
in paired samples of three studied cell lines (cell line
transfected with miR-31-5p mimic and cell lines
transfected with control mimic). Total RNA was purified
