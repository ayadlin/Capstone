ABSTRACT
Cobalt-chrome alloy is a widely used biomaterial in joint replacements, dental
implants and spinal rods. Although it is an effective and biocompatible material,
adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMD) have arisen in a minority of patients,
particularly in those with metal-on-metal bearing hip replacements. There is currently
no treatment for ARMD and once progressive, early revision surgery of the implant
is necessary. Therapeutic agents to prevent, halt or reverse ARMD would therefore
be advantageous.
Cobalt ions activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor
responsible for inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We
hypothesised that anti-TLR4 neutralising antibodies, reported to inhibit TLR4mediated inflammation, could prevent the inflammatory response to cobalt ions in
an in vitro macrophage cell culture model.
This study shows that a monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody inhibited cobalt-mediated
increases in pro-inflammatory IL8, CCL20 and IL1A expression, as well as IL-8
secretion. In contrast, a polyclonal antibody did not prevent the effect of cobalt
ions on either IL-8 or IL1A expression, although it did have a small effect on the
CCL20 response. Interestingly, both antibodies inhibited cobalt-mediated neutrophil
migration although the greater effect was observed with the monoclonal antibody.
In summary our data shows that a monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody can inhibit
cobalt-mediated inflammatory responses while a polyclonal antibody only inhibits
the effect of specific cytokines. Anti-TLR4 antibodies have therapeutic potential in
ARMD although careful antibody design is required to ensure that the LPS response
is preserved.

INTRODUCTION

collections, metallosis, muscle and soft tissue necrosis,
pseudotumours, osteolysis and implant loosening [1].
These tissue responses are collectively termed ‘adverse
reactions to metal debris’ (ARMD) [2]. Analysis of the
MoM peri-implant tissues reveals a cellular infiltrate
dominated by macrophages [3] and lymphocytes [4]
along with high levels of cytokines and chemokines which
strongly suggests an inflammatory response.
Currently MoM total hip replacement revision rates
range from 15% to 35% at 7 years compared to 2% for

Cobalt-chrome alloy is widely used as a biomaterial
in orthopaedic joint replacements, spinal reconstructive
rods and dental implants. Over recent years concerns have
emerged regarding early failure in hip replacements with
cobalt-chrome metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings. These
failing joint replacements are associated with high levels
of cobalt and chromium in the blood and within the joint
space itself. Clinical reactions include abnormal fluid

conventional metal-on-polyethylene devices [5]. Despite
the high rate of revision for MoM hip replacements there
are still more than 1 million patients worldwide with
these hips implanted and un-revised [6], which require
ongoing surveillance. The major therapeutic option
for pseudotumours and ARMD is currently removal
of all cobalt-chrome alloy and revision to a ceramic or
polyethylene hip implant. This is a more complex surgical
procedure than primary hip replacements due to the
erosion bone stock and loss of muscle and soft tissue,
and post-revision recovery is often slow and incomplete.
Hip revision for pseudotumours has been associated with
operative risks comprising 75% blood transfusion, 19%
recurrent dislocation, 19% nerve palsy, 13% component
loosening and 40% risk of re-revision [7, 8] causing
distress to patients and a considerable financial burden
to the NHS. An adjuvant therapeutic agent that could
ameliorate or inhibit the initiation of the inflammatory
signalling cascade that results in ARMD and thus lessen
the surgical insult or even dampen down ARMD without
the need for surgical intervention would therefore
be attractive. Current research into ARMD therapies
focuses on modulation of the ongoing inflammatory
response by polarising macrophages towards an antiinflammatory phenotype [9] or inhibiting the function of
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as CCL2 [10] and have
shown positive results in in vivo models. However they
are made more complex by the pleiotropic and redundant
nature of cytokines and chemokines.
Recent studies by our group and others have shown
that cobalt ions generated by MoM hip articulation can
activate the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) [11-14] which is most commonly known as the
receptor for Gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Cobalt-mediated TLR4 activation increases
the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
interleukin-8 (IL-8, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
8 or CXCL8), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) in macrophages
and endothelial cells [11, 14]. A small molecule TLR4
antagonist, CLI-095, is able to prevent these responses
[14] but its therapeutic use is limited because of its
intracellular mechanism of action.
Antibodies represent a successful and rapidly
evolving therapeutic strategy. Both monoclonal and
polyclonal anti-TLR4 antibodies are currently under
investigation as therapeutic agents in the prevention of
septic shock induced by LPS [15], and a number of antiTLR4 antibodies are currently in clinical trials to improve
test their effectiveness in diseases including rheumatoid
arthritis [16]. We therefore hypothesised that anti-TLR4
neutralising antibodies could prevent cobalt-mediated
TLR4 activation, using changes in cytokine secretion
and expression by macrophages as markers of receptor
activation and inhibition.

Antibody cytotoxicity
MonoMac 6 cells were incubated with 10μg/
ml MAb2-hTLR4 or 5μg/ml PAb-hTLR4 for 16h.
Cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue staining and
cells were counted using a Luna II automated cell counter.
MAb2-hTLR4 did not affect MonoMac 6 cells viability
(Figure 1) while PAb-hTLR4 decreased cell viability from
100% to 94% (Figure 1).

Inhibition of cobalt-mediated inflammatory
responses by a monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody
TLR4-expressing MonoMac 6 cells have previously
been shown to upregulate IL-8 secretion and expression
when challenged with cobalt ions [14] and were therefore
selected as an in vitro cell model for this study, using
IL-8 as a marker of TLR4 activation. MonoMac 6 cells
were pre-treated with 10μg/ml MAb2-hTLR4 for 1h
prior to 16h stimulation with 0.75mM CoCl2 or 100ng/
ml LPS. IL-8 protein levels were measured by ELISA
and IL8 expression was quantified by qRT-PCR. CoCl2
and LPS both significantly increased IL-8 secretion to
approximately 5000pg/ml (p<0.001) (Figure 2A). Pretreatment with MAb2-hTLR4 significantly decreased
IL-8 secretion to 3000pg/ml in CoCl2-stimulated cells
(p<0.001) and 4000pg/ml in LPS-stimulated cells. IL8
gene expression followed a similar pattern with significant
upregulation in expression following CoCl2 and LPS
stimulation (both p<0.001) (Figure 2B). MAb2-hTLR4
significantly inhibited CoCl2-mediated IL8 expression,
reducing it from 20-fold to 5-fold (p<0001). The
monoclonal antibody also prevented the IL8 expression
increase induced by LPS (p<0.001).

A polyclonal anti-TLR4 antibody does not prevent
cobalt-mediated IL-8 changes
A polyclonal anti-TLR4 neutralising antibody, PAbhTLR4, is reported to inhibit inflammatory responses
to TLR4 ligands. Using IL-8 expression and secretion
by MonoMac 6 cells as a marker of inflammation, the
ability of PAb-hTLR4 to prevent the cellular response to
cobalt was assessed. MonoMac 6 cells were pre-treated
with 5μg/ml PAb-hTLR4 for 10 minutes prior to 16h
stimulation with either 0.75mM CoCl2 or 100ng/ml LPS.
IL-8 secretion was measured by ELISA and expression by
qRT-PCR.
PAb-hTLR4 did not inhibit CoCl2 or LPS-mediated
IL-8 secretion (Figure 2C) (p>0.4 in both cases). In
untreated cells there was an increase in IL-8 secretion in

the presence of the antibody although this did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.051). IL8 expression following
LPS stimulation was inhibited by PAb-hTLR4 (p<0.001)
(Figure 2D). However the antibody could not prevent the
effect of cobalt ions on IL8 expression (p=0.095).

MonoMac 6 cells were pre-stimulated with MAb2-hTLR4
or PAb-hTLR4 as described earlier before 16h stimulation
with 0.75mM CoCl2 or 100ng/ml LPS. Conditioned media
was collected and used in a transwell neutrophil migration
assay.
Conditioned media from cobalt-stimulated
MonoMac 6 cells significantly increased neutrophil
migration (p<0.001) (Figure 5). Both MAb2-hTLR4
and PAb-hTLR4 pre-incubation significantly inhibited
this effect (both p<0.001) although the monoclonal
antibody induced a greater reduction in migration than the
polyclonal.

MAb2-hTLR4
prevents
cobalt-mediated
expression of CCL20 and IL1A
Using qRT-PCR arrays 4h stimulation of MonoMac
6 cells with 0.75mM CoCl2 was found to upregulate
expression of pro-inflammatory CCL20 and IL1A. The
array results were subsequently validated by TaqManbased qRT-PCR. This analysis confirmed a significant
upregulation in both CCL20 (Figure 3A) and IL1A (Figure
3B) expression following 4h exposure of MonoMac 6 cells
to 0.75mM CoCl2 (both p<0.001), showing the potential of
these genes as targets for studying antibody efficacy.
The ability of MAb2-hTLR4 to inhibit cobaltmediated changes in CCL20 and IL1A expression was
therefore investigated using the same treatment protocol
as described for the IL-8 assays. CCL20 expression was
upregulated approximately 10-fold by CoCl2 stimulation
(p<0.001) whilst the effect of LPS was greater, with a 50fold increase in expression (p<0.001) (Figure 4A). MAb2hTLR4 significantly decreased expression of CCL20 in
response to CoCl2 and the positive control LPS (p<0.001
in both cases). IL1A expression was also significantly
increased by CoCl2 (p=0.0283) and LPS (p<0.001) (Figure
4B). In the presence of MAb2-hTLR4 CoCl2-mediated
IL1A expression was significantly decreased (p=0.0224)
as was that of LPS (p<0.001).

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that a monoclonal antiTLR4 neutralising antibody (MAb2-hTLR4) inhibits
pro-inflammatory IL8, IL1A and CCL20 expression and
IL-8 secretion by MonoMac 6 cells following cobalt
stimulation. MAb2-hTLR4 provided more effective
inhibition than the polyclonal antibody PAb-hTLR4 which
did not prevent cobalt-mediated IL-8 or IL1A responses
although it did inhibit CCL20 expression. Despite the
differences in their inhibitory effect both neutralising
antibodies prevented neutrophil migration in response to
cobalt stimulation, with a greater effect observed for the
monoclonal antibody.
The differences in inhibition between the
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are likely due to the
fact that cobalt and LPS bind to TLR4 in different ways;
cobalt binds directly to the receptor within a ‘histidine
pocket’ composed of histidine residues H431, 456 and 458
[11] while LPS initially binds LPS binding protein (LBP)
before transfer across a series of adaptor proteins to the
receptor itself. If an antibody blocks an adaptor protein
binding site then it may inhibit LPS without having an
effect on the cobalt response. However as PAb-hTLR4
blocked CCL20 expression it may have a small effect on
receptor homodimerisation which is required for activation
by both LPS and cobalt ions [11].
The differences in cobalt and LPS binding sites
could be exploited for the development of an antibody
to prevent ARMD. For an anti-TLR4 antibody to be
successful in preventing the inflammatory response
to cobalt ions it is essential that the immunological
response to LPS is maintained or else there is a high
risk of overwhelming bacterial infection and potentially
lethal septic shock. The development of a novel antibody
targeting the cobalt-specific binding site of TLR4 could
prevent activation by cobalt ions while still allowing an
inflammatory response to LPS.
This study focused on a select group of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by cobalt
based on previous work performed by the group. However
individual cytokine targets are of limited value when
investigating the potential of a therapeutic agent as it is the

A polyclonal anti-TLR4 antibody can inhibit
other cobalt-mediated inflammatory effects
Expression of CCL20 and IL1A was investigated
to validate the inability of PAb-hTLR4 to inhibit TLR4
activation by cobalt ions using the same treatment protocol
described for the IL-8 assays. CCL20 expression was
assessed by qRT-PCR and found to be abrogated by the
polyclonal antibody (Figure 4C) (p<0.001) but there was
no effect on IL1A (Figure 4D) (p=0.8246). PAb-hTLR4
inhibited expression of both genes in response to LPS
stimulation (p<0.001 for CCL20 and p=0.0044 for IL1A).

Cobalt-mediated neutrophil migration is inhibited
by TLR4 neutralising antibodies
Inflammatory cell infiltration is a hallmark of MoM
peri-implant tissues. As IL-8 secretion is significantly
increased by cobalt ions and IL-8 is chemotactic for
neutrophils, the effect of cobalt and the neutralising
antibodies on primary neutrophil migration was assessed.

cumulative effect of cytokines and chemokines that leads
to ARMD. For this reason neutrophil migration assays
were performed to assess the capacity of the antibodies
to prevent cobalt-mediated neutrophil recruitment. Both
antibodies inhibited neutrophil migration; the effect of
the monoclonal antibody was greater than that of the
polyclonal which supports the other data described in this
study. It also indicates that neutrophil chemokines other
than IL-8 are inhibited by PAb-hTLR4. Additional in
vitro functional assays or in an in vivo mouse model with
humanised TLR4 could be used to further investigate these
effects and antibody efficacy.

neutralising antibodies can prevent cobalt activation
of the receptor and subsequent inflammatory cytokine
upregulation by human macrophages. The design of an
antibody for ARMD therapy will be critical to provide the
most effective inhibition of cobalt-mediated inflammation
while still ensuring that the LPS-binding capacity of TLR4
is preserved. This work suggests that TLR4 has excellent
potential as a therapeutic target in the prevention of

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cytotoxicity

MonoMac 6 cells

Cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue staining;
10μl trypan blue dye (Logos Biosystems, Anyang-City,
South Korea) was mixed with 10μl cell suspension and the
number of live and dead cells was counted using a Luna-II
Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems). Data was
normalised to 100% viability for untreated cells.

Metal ion stimulation
Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2) was diluted
in complete cell culture medium and used at 0.75mM, a
physiological concentration optimised in a previous study
[14]. TLR4-specific LPS (from E. coli serotype J5, Alexis
Biochemicals, San Diego, USA) was used at 100ng/ml as
a positive control for receptor activation.

Neutralising antibodies
PAb-hTLR4 (Invivogen, San Diego, USA) is a
polyclonal rat IgG antibody reported to neutralise TLR4
and prevent activation by its ligands [17]. MAb2-hTLR4
(Invivogen) is a monoclonal mouse IgG1 antibody (clone
3C3) reported to neutralise TLR4 and prevent receptor
activation by agonists [15].
