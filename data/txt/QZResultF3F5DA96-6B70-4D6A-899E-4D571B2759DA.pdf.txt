Human Tumor Cells

Abstract
Defining the processes that sustain telomere maintenance is critical to our understanding of cancer and
longevity. PIF1 is a nonprocessive 50 ->30 human DNA helicase that exhibits broad substrate specificity. In vitro
studies have implicated PIF1 in maintaining telomeres and processing stalled DNA replication forks, but
disruption of the murine Pif1 gene did not yield any apparent phenotype. In this study, we evaluated the
function of the PIF1 gene in human cells by using siRNA knockdown strategies to gauge its role in the
response to DNA replication stress. We found that PIF1 depletion reduced the survival of both p53-deficient
and p53-proficient human tumor cells by triggering apoptosis. In contrast, nonmalignant cells were
unaffected by PIF1 depletion. Apoptosis induction in tumor cells was augmented by cotreatment with
replication inhibitors (thymidine, hydroxyurea, or gemcitabine). When sensitive PIF1-depleted cells were
released from a thymidine-induced S-phase arrest, there remained a subpopulation of cells that failed to enter
S-phase. This cell subpopulation displayed an increase in levels of cyclin E and p21, as well as a deficiency in
S-phase checkpoint markers that were induced with thymidine in PIF1 expressing cells. Specifically, CHK1
activation was suppressed and we detected no consistent changes in ATM S1981 autophosphorylation,
gH2AX induction, or RPA hyperphosphorylation. Death in PIF1-depleted cells was detected in late G1/early
S-phase and was dependent on caspase-3 activity. Taken together, our findings suggest roles for PIF1 in
S-phase entry and progression that are essential to protect human tumor cells from apoptosis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
DNA helicases are essential for the unwinding of DNA that
occurs during replication, repair, and transcription. Human
cells encode a number of helicases that reflect this broad
range of functions. Several of these, involved in replication or
transcription, are essential for the growth and survival of cells,
whereas others are required to maintain genetic stability.
Inherited mutations of helicases involved in cellular response
to replication fork stress predispose to premature aging and
early onset of various forms of cancer. Helicases affected in
these disorders include the human RecQ-related helicases
BLM (mutated in Blooms syndrome; ref. 1), WRN (Werners
syndrome; ref. 2), RecQ4 (Rothmund–Thomson syndrome; ref.

3), and the 50 ->30 helicase FancJ/BACH1 (Fanconi's Anemia;
ref. 4).
The highly conserved protein Pif1 is another such helicase
implicated in the maintenance of genome stability. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 (ScPif1) is a nonprocessive 50 ->30 helicase. It was first identified in a screen for genes that affect the
frequency of recombination between rþ and r mitochondrial DNA (5). Extensive work has shown that ScPif1 plays a
role in a wide range of DNA transactions including the
regulation of telomere length (6), Okazaki fragment maturation (7), replication of ribosomal DNA (8), and G-quadruplex
DNA resolution (9). S. cerevisiae also encodes a second PIF1like protein called RRM3. This helicase has a more prominent
role at paused replication forks, where it disrupts protein–
DNA complexes at specific (RRM3-sensitive) sites that could
slow the translocation of the replicative helicase complex (10).
Despite this wide range of functions, ScPif1 and RRM3 are not
essential genes in S. cerevisiae although cell-cycle progression
and growth rate are slowed in double mutants (8).
All mammalian cells studied thus far have only a single
PIF1-like protein that has nearly equal identity and similarity
to ScRRM3 and ScPIF1 (11). Although PIF1 has been found in
both nuclei and mitochondria (12), its role in mammalian cells
is less certain. Although antibodies to PIF1 immunoprecipitate telomerase activity from cultured human cells (11),
knockouts of the mouse Pif1 gene do not affect telomere
length, chromosome stability, or mitochondrial function in

PIF1 and Tumor Cell Death

cells and mPif1/ mice have no obvious phenotype (13).
However in vitro studies of purified PIF1 protein indicate that
it can bind and unwind DNA structures resembling stalled
replication forks to produce free 30 ssDNA ends, suggesting
that PIF1 could play a role in the response to DNA replication
stress (14). The aim of the work reported here was to investigate the potential role of PIF1 in the cellular response to DNA
replication stress. Our results suggest that PIF1 is essential to
protect a number of human tumor cell lines from apoptosis,
particularly after the inhibition of DNA replication.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cultures
Human tumor cell lines and the human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293 line were from American Type Culture Collection.
p21/ and p53/ derivatives of HCT116 were provided by
Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD). The immortalized human fibroblast cell line MRC5
VA was from the CRUK London Laboratories Cell Repository.
Identity of the lines used in these experiments was confirmed
by DNA fingerprinting (LGC Standards). Cells were carried for
no longer than 2 months before rethawing from verified frozen
stocks. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma and found
to be free of contamination. HCT116 strains overexpressing
FLAG-tagged (HPF7 and HPF8) or untagged (PH15 and PH16)
PIF1 were obtained by transfection of the tagged or untagged
PIF1 cDNA cloned into the expression vector pCAG-Flox.
Stable isolates expressing PIF1 were obtained by selection
in puromycin.
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For experiments using
thymidine, dialyzed FBS was used to remove interfering
deoxynucleosides. Thymidine and hydroxyurea (HU; SigmaAldrich) were used at a concentration of 2 mmol/L. Gemcitabine (Tocris Bioscience) was used at a concentration of 25
mmol/L, and Aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.2 mmol/L. A
total of 100 mmol/L of the Caspase-3 Inhibitor II Z-DEVD-FMK
(Calbiochem) was added to cultures 1 hour prior to treatment
with replication inhibitors.
siRNA transfection
PIF1 siRNAs, sense-strand sequences GGCCAGAGCAUCUUCUUCATT (siRNA1), GGGAAGUCAUAUCUGCUAATT
(siRNA 2), and CCCUUCAGAGCCUAACCAATT (siRNA3),
were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Ambion). The
CHK1 siRNA (sense strand: GAAGCAGUCGCAGUGAAGA)
was designed by J. Blackburn and C. Smythe. Control siRNAs,
containing nonspecific sequences that do not have homology
in the human genome, were provided by Eurogentec (OR0030-NEG). siRNA duplexes were transfected into cells by
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle analysis was done as described previously (15).
Stained nuclei were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences)
by using CellQuest software. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
incorporation was analyzed as previously described (16).

Detection of apoptosis
Caspase-3 activation was analyzed by flow cytometry as
described previously (15). Annexin V assays were done as
directed by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences).
Cyclin E and p21 analysis
After indicated treatments, cells were fixed with 70% icecold ethanol, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 10
minutes in PBS-T (PBS/0.1% BSA/0.2% Tween 20) before
incubation with a 1:50 dilution of the primary antibody in
PBS-T (anti-cyclin E, Invitrogen 32-1600, or anti-p21 Pharmingen) for 30 minutes. After 2 washes with PBS-T, cells
were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (1:10; Dako) for 30 minutes,
washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing
5 mg/mL PI (Sigma) and 100 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma). After
a 30-minute incubation, cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry.
Protein extraction and Western blotting
Western blots were done as described (17). Proteins were
detected with the ECL Detection System (GE Healthcare) by
using the following antibodies: gH2AX (2577; Cell Signaling),
CHK1 (2360; Cell Signaling), b-actin (A-5060; Sigma-Aldrich),
RPA34 (NA19L; Calbiochem), cleaved caspase-3 (ab32042;
Abcam), phospho-ATM (Ser1981; 2152–1; Epitomics), phospho-CHK1 (Ser345; 2349; Cell Signalling), and FLAG M2
(F1804; Sigma). Antibodies to PIF1 were raised in rabbits.
Amino acids 1 to 205 of PIF1 were expressed as a GST fusion
protein, using pET11c in E. coli BL21(DE3). The fusion protein
was bound to GST sepharose and the PIF1 moiety cleaved off
the beads by using thrombin after extensive washing of the
beads. Further purification was achieved by size exclusion
chromatography (Superdex 75). Band intensities on the Western blots were quantified by densitometry by using the
ImageJ software (18).
RNA purification and quantitative analysis of total
mRNA levels
RNA was extracted from adherent cells by using the
RNeasy Plus Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was treated with DNase I
RNase-free (Roche) and purified over an RNeasy column.
Two micrograms of RNA were used for first-strand cDNA
synthesis by using oligo(dT)18 (Bioscript kit; Bioline). qPCRs
(quantitative PCR; Quantace) were run on a 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Samples were
heated for 10 minutes at 95 C and amplified for 45 cycles (15
sec 95 C/15 sec 59 C/25 sec 72 C). All samples were analyzed in duplicate. Data were evaluated by using SDS 2.2.1
data analysis software (Applied Biosystems) and the Pfaffl
method (19). PIF1 primers were designed by using Primer3plus (20) and NCBI (21) programs: PIF1 50 -ccctggattgtgtggagatt-30 (forward) and 50 -actccagactgaggctcctg-30 (reverse).
Primers for the U1 snRNA internal control were from Hautbergue (22).
Immunofluorescence analysis
RPA foci were analyzed as described previously (16).

blotting. At 24 hours posttransfection, PIF1 levels were
reduced 3-fold relative to control siRNA-transfected cells
and this level of depletion was maintained through 48 hours
(Fig. 1A). At 72 hours, PIF1 levels remained low in PIF1 siRNAtransfected cells although the levels of this protein also
decreased in cultures treated with the control siRNA as these
approached confluence. In addition, DNA expression array
analysis showed a highly significant (P ¼ 2.69  104) 3-fold

the siRNA. To further confirm the effectiveness of the siRNA,
HCT116 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged PIF1 were transfected with PIF1 siRNA. Western blot analysis showed a

PIF1 depletion sensitizes HCT116 cells to DNA
replication stress
Given our previous work showing that static fork-like
structures could serve as efficient substrates for purified
PIF1 (14), we investigated the effects of siRNA-mediated
depletions of PIF1 on cells exposed to DNA replication stress.
The effect of the siRNA treatment on PIF1 levels was first
determined by Western blotting. PIF1 is present at very low
levels in mammalian cells (11) and large amounts of extracts
had to be loaded onto gels to visualize the protein by Western

death (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). In addition, the PIF1
siRNA had a substantially reduced apoptotic effect on 2
HCT116 strains overexpressing PIF1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Other replication inhibitors had similar effects on
PIF1-depleted cells. Treatment of PIF1-depleted HCT116 cultures with HU or gemcitabine produced an increased level of
subG1 cells relative to controls (Supplementary Fig. S4A and
B). Taken together, these results indicate that PIF1 protects
HCT116 cells from apoptosis, particularly during DNA replication stress induced by several replication inhibitors.

pronounced reduction of the tagged protein at 24 or 48 hours
posttransfection by using either PIF1 or anti-FLAG antibodies
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine the effect of PIF1 depletion on cell survival
during replication stress, HCT116 cells were treated with
control or PIF1 siRNAs for 24 hours before plating in the
presence of the replication inhibitors thymidine or hydroxyurea (HU) or the therapeutic deoxycytidine analog gemcitabine for colony formation. Interestingly, cells depleted of
PIF1 showed reduced frequencies of colony formation relative
to cells treated with control siRNA and these were further
reduced by exposure to the replication inhibitors (Fig. 1B).
Most notably, PIF1-depleted cells showed a 270-fold decrease
in survival in 1.0 nmol/L gemcitabine relative to cells treated
with the control siRNA.
We next determined the effect of the replication inhibitors
on cell-cycle distribution following PIF1 depletion. HCT116
cells transfected with control or PIF1 siRNAs were treated
with thymidine and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C and D). PIF1-depleted cultures that were not
treated with thymidine showed a significant increase in the
level of cells with a subG1 DNA content by 24 hours relative to
control. Cells transfected with the control siRNA before
thymidine treatment accumulated in early S-phase at 24 hours
and progressed slowly through S-phase, characteristic of the
slowing of DNA replication during thymidine-induced dCTP
starvation. PIF1-depleted cells showed a similar accumulation
in early S-phase after the 24-hour thymidine treatment but
after 48 hours, there was a marked decrease in the proportion
of cells in S-phase, accompanied by a significant increase of
cells with a subG1 DNA content. The fraction of "subG1 cells" in
PIF1-depleted cultures after exposure to thymidine was significantly greater than that seen in cells depleted of PIF1 alone.
Similar increases in the proportion of cells showing the early
apoptotic marker Annexin V were found in PIF1-depleted cells
in the presence or absence of thymidine (Fig. 1E).
To investigate potential off-target effects, individual siRNAs
in the pool used here were tested and all had similar effects on
depletion of PIF transcript, as measured by qPCR and cell

Effects of PIF1 depletion on other cell lines
Given that knockouts of mPif1 in mouse cells did not
produce a similar effect on cell death (13), we next determined
the effect of PIF1-depletion on other human cell lines. Both the
p53-deficient colon cancer cell line SW480 and the p53-proficient breast cancer line MCF7 responded similarly to HCT116
with respect to the production of subG1 cells following PIF1
depletion in the presence or absence of thymidine (Table 1).
MCF7 cells were particularly sensitive to PIF1 depletion with
more than 80% dying even in the absence of the replication
inhibitor. In contrast, 2 immortalized nontumor cell lines
(MRC5VA and HEK293) showed little effect.
PIF1-depleted cells accumulate at the G1/S border and
in late S-phase after release from thymidine block
To further examine the effect of PIF1 depletion on S-phase
transition, HCT116 cells transfected with control or PIF1
siRNAs were treated with thymidine for 24 hours before
release into thymidine-free medium. Cells were labeled with
BrdU for 1 hour before transfer to deoxynucleoside-free
medium. At various times after release, cells were harvested
and analyzed for DNA and BrdU content by flow cytometry
(Fig. 2A). A lower fraction of released PIF1-depleted cells
incorporated BrdU relative to cells treated with the control
siRNA (Fig. 2B and C). Noticeably, about 20% of PIF1-depleted
cells failed to enter S-phase and incorporate BrdU (Fig. 2C).
Unlike cells treated with the control siRNA, PIF1-depleted cells
incorporating BrdU also accumulated in late S-phase at 4 to 6

Figure 2. PIF1 is required for efficient entry into S-phase and S-phase progression. A, HCT116 cells, transfected with control or PIF1 siRNAs, were treated
with 2 mmol/L thymidine for 24 hours. Thymidine-containing medium was removed and cultures were washed (W) with thymidine-free medium before
transfer to BrdU (10 mmol/L)-containing medium. After 1 hour, cultures were washed with BrdU-free medium and restored to deoxynucleoside-free medium. At
indicated times postrelease, cells were harvested and analyzed for DNA content and BrdU incorporation by flow cytometry. B and C, top panels in each
present scatter plots of analysis of BrdU incorporation and DNA content. Middle panels present DNA content of all the cells analyzed, whereas the
bottom panels present the DNA content of cells labeled with BrdU (gated into cells with G1, S, or G2/M DNA contents in top panels). Percentages presented in
bottom panels represent the proportion of cells incorporating BrdU. Left-most panels present randomly growing cultures labeled for 1 hour with BrdU
before harvest. The next panel from left presents the cells labeled for 1 hour with BrdU after thymidine release. The remaining panels present cells released from
both deoxynucleosides for the indicated times. Closed arrowheads in C indicate PIF1-depleted cells that do not enter S-phase after release, whereas
open arrowheads indicate those delayed from entering G2-M. The data presented are representative of 3 independent experiments. Values for percentages of
cells incorporating BrdU represent means of values obtained from 3 experiments  SDs.

S-phase checkpoints in PIF1-depleted cells after
thymidine treatment
Cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents or replication stress
rapidly activate ATR- and ATM-mediated signaling cascades.
CHK1 is a key component of the ATR-mediated cascade and is
quickly activated in response to ssDNA that is formed by the
disruption of DNA replication (23) to suppress inappropriate
origin firing, facilitate replication restart, and prevent apoptosis. Given our in vitro data suggesting a potential role for
PIF1 in the generation of ssDNA at stalled forks (14), we next
determined the effect of PIF1 depletion on signaling triggered
by thymidine treatment. Cell-free extracts prepared from
PIF1-depleted HCT116 cells were assayed for checkpoint
activation by Western blotting by using antibodies for phosphorylated forms of CHK1, ATM, or H2AX. pSer345 CHK1 was
detected in cells treated with the control siRNA by 1 hour after
thymidine treatment, whereas pSer1981 ATM and gH2AX
were only weakly detected (Fig. 4A) as previously reported
(16, 24). Despite the increased level of apoptosis in PIF1depleted cells, phosphorylated forms of these checkpoint
proteins were not detected in the absence of the replication
inhibitor (Fig. 4A). After thymidine treatment, the level of
pSer345 CHK1 was noticeably lower at all times in the PIF1depleted cells relative to cells transfected with the control
siRNA. Interestingly, the fraction of cells showing RPA foci was
also significantly decreased in PIF1-depleted cells treated with
the replication inhibitor aphidicolin (Fig. 4B) relative to cells
treated with the control siRNA, suggesting that ssDNA formation may be suppressed in PIF1-depleted cells. RPA hyper-

hours after release from thymidine, suggesting a delay in Sphase progression. Similar cell-cycle delays at the G1/S border
and in late S-phase were observed with PIF1-depleted SW480
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To clearly distinguish cells entering S-phase from those that
did not, thymidine-released HCT116 cells were labeled with
BrdU for 6 hours. Under these conditions, unlabeled G1 cells
persisted at least 24 hours. There was a weak increase in the
level of unlabelled cells with a subG1 DNA content (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, the level of BrdU-labeled cells with
a subG1 DNA content increased more rapidly, suggesting that
cycling cells may be more prone to apoptosis.
Flow cytometric measurements of DNA content and cyclin
E in PIF1-depleted HCT116 cells released into thymidine-free
medium indicate that cells failing to enter S-phase have an
elevated level of cyclin E (Fig. 3A and B). However, levels of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were also high in the
PIF1-depleted cells relative to controls, particularly in cells
retained at the G1/S border (Fig. 3C–E). To further address the
potential role of p21 in the induction of death in PIF1-depleted
cells, p21/ HCT116 cells were depleted of PIF1 in the
presence or absence of thymidine. The level of subG1 cells
in PIF1-depleted p21/ cultures increased relative to control
siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, the level of death in
PIF1-depleted p21/ HCT116 cells was higher than that
found in p21þ/þ HCT116 cells. Taken together, these results
suggest that p21 protects cells from entry into S-phase and
apoptosis triggered by PIF1 depletion.

Apoptosis in PIF1-depleted cells is caspase-3 dependent
In CHK1-depleted cells, apoptosis has been shown to
proceed by either caspase-3 or caspase-2–dependent pathways following replication inhibition (15) or DNA damage (26).
PIF1-depleted HCT116 cells showed detectable levels of activated caspase-3 at 24 hours in the presence or absence of
thymidine (Fig. 5A). Levels of activated caspase-3 were further
increased in PIF1-depleted cells after a 48-hour treatment with
thymidine. Activated caspase-2 was not detected under any of
these conditions (data not presented).
Given the effects of the PIF1 depletion on thymidine-treated
cells in G1 or S-phase, we next determined where caspase-3
activation occurred in the cell cycle by flow cytometry. The
level of PIF1-depleted cells showing caspase-3 activation was
significantly elevated after a 48 hour-thymidine treatment
(Fig. 5B and C). The percentage of PIF1-depleted cells showing
activated caspase-3 was also increased at 48 or 72 hours
posttransfection in the absence of thymidine treatment, but
this did not reach significance after 72 hours (P ¼ 0.06) relative
to cells treated with the control siRNA. PIF1-depleted cells
having increased levels of activated caspase-3 predominantly
showed a G1/early S-phase DNA content. In addition, the

cultures in the presence or absence of thymidine (Fig. 5D).
Codepletion of CHK1 and PIF1 does not enhance or
suppress apoptosis in response to replication inhibitors
Given the importance of CHK1 in the apoptotic response to
replication inhibitors (27), we next determined the effect of
codepletion of these 2 proteins. HCT116 cultures, transfected
with CHK1 or PIF1 siRNAs singly or in combination and then
treated or not treated with thymidine for 48 hours, were
analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. The resulting
cell-cycle distributions were compared with those of cells
treated with the control siRNA (Fig. 6A and B). Cultures
depleted of CHK1 or PIF1 showed increased levels of cells
with a subG1 DNA content and a corresponding decrease in
the level of S-phase cells after thymidine treatment relative to
cells treated with the control siRNA. Codepleted cultures
showed a virtually identical response to those depleted of
either protein alone. Unlike CHK1, PIF1-depleted cells show
an increased level of subG1 cells in the absence of thymidine
and this is also evident in the codepleted cultures.

Apoptosis

Discussion
DNA helicases have been shown to play key roles in the
protection of cells from DNA replication stress and DNA
damage (4). Consistent with a role for PIF1 in the maintenance
of replication fork integrity, we show that PIF1 depletion in
human tumor cells can prevent entry into S-phase and slow Sphase progression upon release from thymidine-induced replication arrest. CHK1 activation following replication stress is
suppressed in PIF1-depleted tumor cells. Cell viability is
reduced and there is an increased level of apoptosis in late
G1/early S-phase that is enhanced by treatment with replication inhibitors (Fig. 6C). PIF1-depleted cells arrested at G1/S
have elevated levels of cyclin E as well as p21, suggesting that
they are prevented from entering S-phase and, to some extent,
may be protected from death. Consistent with this conclusion,
p21/ cells that lack this G1/S checkpoint show increased
levels of cell death.
Yeast Pif1 helicases are involved in a wide range of DNA
transactions, including the regulation of telomere length and
the resolution of G-quadruplex DNA that are important for the
maintenance of genomic stability. Studies of the single PIF1
helicase in mammalian cells have not produced consistent
evidence for similar roles. Knockouts of the mouse gene do not
lead to genetic instability and mPif1/ mice have no obvious
phenotype (13). Thus, it was proposed that PIF1 function is
redundant in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, in vitro analysis
of purified full-length PIF1 suggested that it bound and
unwound DNA structures that might form during DNA replication stress, including structures resembling stalled replication forks (14) or G-quadruplexes (28). The effects of PIF1
depletion on S-phase transition, checkpoint activation, and

5006

apoptosis in tumor cells are consistent with these in vitro
results; however, nontumor cell lines did not show similar
responses. Therefore, we propose that the redundancy that
protects mouse cells from loss of mPif1 may be lost in human
tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor cells may encounter higher
levels or different forms of stress. It has been reported that
oncogene activation and the loss of control of entry into Sphase may lead to chronic DNA replication stress in many
types of tumor cells (29, 30). In such conditions, tumor cells
may show increased dependence upon helicases such as PIF1
to maintain fork integrity and viability. Other 50 ->30 helicases
from human cells have been characterized and these may
share overlapping functions with PIF1. In particular, it has
recently been reported that BACH1/FANCJ is required for
ATR-dependent phosphorylation events triggered by DNA
replication stress (31) and shares an affinity for G-quadruplex
structures (32). Thus, tumor cells may show varying dependence upon helicases determined by the level of expression or
genetic status of the various helicases and the level or nature
of the replication stress they encounter.
In vitro assays of PIF1 binding and unwinding on artificial
substrates resembling replication forks (14) suggested that
PIF1 could play a role in the generation of ssDNA that triggers
activation of CHK1. Consistent with this argument, CHK1
activation, which is dependent upon ssDNA formation (23),
was lower in PIF1-depleted cells exposed to thymidine. Other
downstream events triggered by ssDNA, including RPA foci
formation and RPA hyperphosphorylation (16, 33), were also
suppressed in PIF1-depleted cells. Recent work has shown the
importance of CHK1 in the control of apoptosis during DNA
replication stress and other forms of DNA damage (15, 26, 27).
The experiments reported here indicate several similarities in

PIF1 and Tumor Cell Death

the induction of apoptosis in CHK1 and PIF1-depleted cells.
Both types of cells commit to apoptosis in late G1/early Sphase by a caspase-3–dependent mechanism in response to
replication inhibitors. Furthermore, codepletion of PIF1 and
CHK1 show levels of apoptosis similar to those found in cells
depleted of the 2 proteins alone. On the other hand, the
induction of death in PIF1-depleted cells did not strictly
require treatment with replication inhibitors. Further work
is needed to investigate the relationship between PIF1, CHK1
activation, and the induction of cell death.
These findings also have potential therapeutic applications.
Therapies that specifically induce apoptosis in tumor cells, but
not nontumor cells, obviously have distinct advantages for the
treatment of cancer patients. Although mouse knockouts
indicate that mPif1 is not essential for development or tumor
suppression, our initial data suggest that tumor cell lines are
particularly responsive to the apoptotic effects of PIF1 depletion. Recently, an inhibitor of the WRN helicase was identified
and shown to have growth inhibitory and proapoptotic activ-

ities in a number of tumor cell lines (34). Our findings indicate
that searches for inhibitors of other helicases with roles in
replication and/or repair may be warranted.
