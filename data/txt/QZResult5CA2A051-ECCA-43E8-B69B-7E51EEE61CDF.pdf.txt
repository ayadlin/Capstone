espite improvements in initial survival using carboplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy, long-term survival rates for
women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and comparable
primary peritoneal cancers remain disappointing.1-5 The majority of
women respond well to primary chemotherapy; however, relapse
within a few years is common. Several institutions have reported information on the long-term outcomes of women who had ‘negative’
second-look surgery; approximately 40% of this most favorable subset of patients relapsed within 5 years.6,7 Hence, there is a great deal
of interest in developing effective consolidation therapy.
Intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy remains a promising option
for the treatment of ovarian cancer and similar cancers principally
confined to the peritoneal cavity. A recent randomized phase 3 trial

in patients with ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma
demonstrated that i.p. administration of cisplatin
and paclitaxel improved overall survival by
5.5 months compared with intravenous (i.v.) administration (23.8 months vs 18.3 months, P 5 .05).8
Because the chemotherapeutic agent is delivered
directly into the peritoneal cavity, higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents can potentially be
administered, potentially reducing the systemic toxicities observed in response to i.v. treatment.9-11 The
important role of i.p. therapy as the initial management for women with optimally cytoreduced ovarian
cancer was recently highlighted by a National Cancer
Institute Clinical Announcement.12 The pharmacologic advantages of i.p. chemotherapy may be particularly important for consolidation therapy directed
at microscopic or small-volume persistent disease,
especially if a chemotherapeutic agent that is noncross-reactive with first-line agents is used.
Hofstra et al13 reviewed many chemotherapeutic
agents used in ovarian cancer and their potential for
i.p. infusion. Cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel,
which are currently the primary agents for the treatment of ovarian cancer, have been the most frequently studied. Other agents that have been
evaluated in i.p. studies include etoposide, melphalan, 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, and doxorubicin.13
However, none of these drugs has demonstrated sufficient efficacy with an acceptable safety profile to
gain general acceptance of i.p. chemotherapy for
patients with ovarian cancer.
A newer agent that has demonstrated promise
for both i.v. and i.p. therapy is topotecan (Hycamtin;
GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, Pa).
Topotecan is a water-soluble, semisynthetic analog of
camptothecin with a low risk of hypersensitivity
reactions.14 Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase I and
has a unique mechanism of action compared with
first-line chemotherapy agents.15 Intravenous topotecan has demonstrated reasonable clinical activity
against both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer, with overall response
rates ranging from 29% to 33% and 7% to 23%,
respectively.16-20 Moreover, i.v. topotecan has been
approved by the United Stated Food and Drug
Administration for these indications.14
Intraperitoneal topotecan may be particularly
effective as consolidation therapy administered to
women already in remission because i.p. administration of this topoisomerase inhibitor has substantial
pharmacologic advantages over i.v. administration.9,21,22 First, there is an increase in area under the
curve (AUC) measurements (20-fold for i.p. vs i.v.
topotecan), as expected for any i.p. therapy.9,22 Sec-

ond, the active lactone form of topotecan persists in
the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 1), resulting in a prolonged
direct exposure of peritoneal tumor nodules to
chemotherapy and allowing the peritoneal cavity to
serve as a drug reservoir for diffusion into the circulation (with prolonged serum AUC compared with
conventional i.v. administration).9,21,22
Considering the high risk of relapse in women
with advanced ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal
cancers,23 there are substantial theoretical advantages to sequential i.p. chemotherapy with an
active noncross-resistant agent (ie, topotecan) after
induction chemotherapy with front-line carboplatinpaclitaxel. Compared with standard 5-day i.v. administration, i.p. administration may be more acceptable
for consolidation therapy because of a lower incidence of myelosuppression and greater convenience.9,24 Therefore, in the present feasibility study
the toxicity and efficacy of single-agent i.p. topotecan
administered as consolidation therapy after successful front-line i.v. carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy
was explored in women with advanced ovarian cancer and comparable primary peritoneal cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with stage III/IV ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer that was in clinical complete response
(defined as normalization of cancer antigen 125 [CA125] levels and the absence of cancer on physical
exam, chest radiographs, and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) after surgical cytoreduction and
chemotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel were eligible for this trial. Chemotherapy regimens comparable
to the recognized standard (carboplatin AUC 6 i.v.
and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 i.v. over 3 hours) were permitted. Within 8 weeks of completing initial chemotherapy, patients underwent surgery to place a
peritoneal catheter with a subcutaneous reservoir to
enable administration of i.p. chemotherapy. The procedure also served as a ‘second-look’ surgery, with

eligibility limited to patients with no or minimal residual tumor (1 cm in diameter). A laparoscopic
procedure was favored but not mandated. Patients
were 18 years of age, with a Southwest Oncology
Group performance status of 2 and adequate bone
marrow, renal, and hepatic function. All patients provided informed consent, approved by the Benaroya
Research Institute Review Board in accord with an
assurance filed with and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Patients with adhesions at second-look surgery
that precluded visualization of all peritoneal quadrants or that could have resulted in complications
during peritoneal drug administration were excluded
from the trial. Patients with a current diagnosis of
epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential
were not eligible. Other exclusion criteria included
prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy for pelvic or abdominal tumors. Patients were also excluded if they
presented with other conditions or circumstances
(including evidence of prior or current malignant disease at additional sites, acute hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding requiring blood product support)
that may have compromised the safety of the
patient, or prevented completion of the study and
required follow-up.

Study Design
The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the
ability of patients with prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy to complete a consolidation therapy regimen
with i.p. topotecan. After recovery from second-look
surgery (and within 10 weeks of enrollment), i.p. topotecan 20 mg/m2 diluted in 1 L of normal saline was
infused using an open-ended, nonfenestrated, single
lumen, 8F polyurethane catheter attached to a titanium subcutaneous reservoir (BardPort, Bard Access
Systems, Salt Lake City, Utah) on Day 1 of a 21-day
cycle for either 4 or 6 cycles. Patients with no evidence
of disease or microscopic persistent disease received
4 cycles of i.p. topotecan, whereas patients with macroscopic small volume (1 cm diameter) persistent
disease received 6 cycles of topotecan. Each infusion
was followed by instillation of up to 1 L of saline, as
tolerated, to facilitate peritoneal distribution.
Supportive care with erythropoietin, granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor, or other cytokines was
administered at the discretion of the treating physician. Antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics, and transfusions of blood and blood products were
administered as appropriate. Treatment with hormones or other chemotherapeutic agents was not
permitted except for steroids administered for speci-

fic conditions including antiemesis and treatment of
myalgias/arthralgias.
Safety assessments, which included monitoring
of clinical adverse events and laboratory assessments, were performed during each treatment cycle
using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria (v. 3.0). Dose modifications because of moderate or severe myelosuppression were based on
results from the previous cycle. In case of hematologic suppression (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]
<1200/mL or platelet count 100,000/mL), the dose
was delayed for up to 2 weeks. In case of severe neutropenia (grade 4) and moderate to severe thrombocytopenia (grade 3/4), the dose of topotecan was
reduced to 10 mg/m2 and 15 mg/m2, respectively. To
maintain a pharmacologic advantage over conventional i.v. topotecan, dose reductions below 10 mg/m2
were not permitted.9,25
Secondary endpoints included efficacy evaluations of i.p. topotecan. CA-125 levels were measured
every 3 months for the first 3 years and every
6 months thereafter. Disease progression was defined
as 2 consecutive CA-125 values >100 IU/mL or
results from CT scan or other radiographic imaging
that demonstrated recurrent disease. Survival was
measured from the time of the second-look surgical
procedure until either disease progression, for progression-free survival (PFS), or death from any cause,
for overall survival (OS).

Statistics
On the basis of previous studies in which i.v. topotecan was administered after prior myelosuppressive
therapy,18 an attrition rate of up to 25% was anticipated for patients treated with i.p. topotecan in the
current study. Therefore, target enrollment for this
small pilot study was 20 patients to ensure a minimum number of evaluable patients to assess the tolerability of the regimen. A minimal goal of 15 of 20
(75%) women completing the prescribed course of
consolidation therapy was considered acceptable (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 11-19 patients [55%-95%]).
Both PFS and OS were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method; associated 95% CIs were calculated using normal approximations. Data for
patients who experienced recurrent disease and subsequently underwent salvage therapy were not censored when calculating overall survival.

Patients
Twenty women were entered into this study. The median age of patients was 59 years. Eighteen (90%)

patients had ovarian cancer and 2 had primary peritoneal cancer. Other demographic factors and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 1,
including the results of initial cytoreductive surgery
and findings at second-look surgery. Most (90%) of
the second look surgeries were performed using a
laparoscopic technique.
The primary endpoint, completion of the prescribed course of therapy, was reached by 19 (95%)
women (95% CI, 15-20 patients; 75%-99.9%). Sixteen
women received 4 cycles and 3 women received
6 cycles of i.p. topotecan. The remaining patient
withdrew for personal reasons after 1 cycle.

Safety and Tolerability
Intraperitoneal topotecan doses ranged from 10 to
20 mg/m2 (mean, 18 mg/m2) administered over
83 cycles of therapy. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the most commonly reported grade 3/4
hematologic toxicities, occurring at least once in 45%
of the patients (Table 2). Myelotoxicity was effectively managed with dose reductions, dose delays,
and growth factor support; as a result, the proportion
of individual cycles complicated by hematologic toxicity was much lower. Twelve (60%) patients completed the study regimen without any dose
reduction. Twenty-two (27%) cycles were adminis-

tered at reduced doses because of grade 3/4 myelosuppression. Of these 22 cycles, 10 doses were
reduced to 15 mg/m2 and 12 doses were reduced to
10 mg/m2. Ten (50%) patients had their second cycle
delayed because of myelosuppression; however, all
subsequent cycles were completed on schedule.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered to 15 (75%) patients in 51 (61%) cycles. Erythropoietin was administered to 6 (30%) patients in
20 (24%) cycles. No patients developed grade 3/4
anemia. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild to
moderate in severity, with grade 1/2 abdominal distension and nausea reported in 60% and 40% of
patients, respectively.

Efficacy
The median follow-up from second-look surgery was
42 months (range, 29-62 months). Fourteen patients
experienced relapse 7 to 37 months after secondlook surgery, determined by CA-125 tumor marker
levels and confirmed by CT scan. The median PFS
was 24 months (range, 14-34 months; Fig. 2). Median
PFS measured from initial diagnosis was 30 months
(range, 20-40 months).
Most women who relapsed after i.p. topotecan
had subsequent response to retreatment with carboplatin/taxane chemotherapy. Two women who
relapsed 7 and 16 months from second-look surgery
did not respond to salvage therapy and died of progressive disease. Twelve other women with relapses
between 7 and 37 months from second-look surgery
did respond to salvage carboplatin/taxane therapy.
There were 3 partial responses and 9 complete
responses, and 4 of these women remain alive without evidence of disease.
OS is depicted in Figure 3. At the time of analysis, 16 women are alive and 10 are disease-free. Of
surviving patients, 10 patients received salvage ther-

DISCUSSION
Intraperitoneal topotecan has significant pharmacologic advantages as consolidation therapy compared
with i.v. administration.9,21,22 The FDA-approved
schedule of i.v. topotecan administration, based on
the pharmacokinetics of i.v. topotecan, requires an
inconvenient, intermittent schedule over the course
of 5 days. Approved doses (1.5 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days, repeated after every 3 weeks) have
been associated with substantial myelotoxicity.18,26
For example, in a phase 3 trial of i.v. topotecan in
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 79% of the patients and grade 4
thrombocytopenia occurred in 25% of patients.18 In
addition, 7 of 16 (44%) patients withdrew from the
study because of adverse events.18
In contrast, in a phase 1 clinical trial of i.p. topotecan in women with recurrent ovarian cancer, only
1 case of myelosuppression (grade 3/4) was reported
among 9 patients who received 5 to 15 mg/m2 doses
of i.p. topotecan.9 Grade 1/2 nausea occurred in 40%
of the patients in the current study compared with
80% in this phase 1 trial.9 In addition, grade 1/2 abdominal pain was also lower (47% vs 60%, respectively).9 In the current study, grade 4 neutropenia
and grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 15% and
10% of the patients, respectively. Furthermore, 12 of
20 (60%) patients were able to complete the treatment regimen at the full dose of 20 mg/m2, and,
overall, 19 of 20 patients (95%) completed the treatment regimen with acceptable dose reductions.
The similar safety profile demonstrated in studies of i.p. topotecan suggest that the noncumulative,

manageable toxicity with i.p. topotecan may be more
favorable than i.v. topotecan in patients with
advanced ovarian cancer.9,24,27 For example, a phase
2 study in 22 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer demonstrated that the combination of i.p. topotecan and
oral etoposide was well tolerated as a salvage therapy; the most common grade 4 toxicities were neutropenia (36%) and thrombocytopenia (18%).24 In the
current study, 16 (80%) patients received 4 cycles of
therapy and 3 (15%) patients completed 6 cycles, as
mandated by baseline evaluations at study entry.
Further investigation of prolonged i.p. topotecan
maintenance therapy to potentially improve efficacy
may therefore be warranted, similar to the ongoing
Gynecologic Oncology Group trial in which the efficacy and safety of i.v. paclitaxel or i.v. paclitaxel poliglumex are being evaluated over a 12-month
period.28
Some studies have shown that sequential administration of i.v. topotecan after combination carboplatin-paclitaxel therapy has activity in patients with
poor prognosis (ie, patients who have gross residual
disease after front-line chemotherapy) with a complete response rate of up to 28%.29,30 However,
others, such as the recently reported AGO-OVAR/
GINECO and MITO-1 trials, conclude that consolidation therapy with i.v. topotecan does not improve
PFS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
who had initially responded to carboplatin and
paclitaxel.31,32
The clinical outcomes achieved by i.p. administration of topotecan in preliminary studies do show
promise. Although the current study was not
designed to provide primary efficacy evaluations, the
median PFS was 30 months and the estimated 3 year
OS was 84%. These data compare favorably with that

IP Topotecan in Ovarian CA/Muntz et al.

reported by Pfisterer et al,31 where median PFS
measured from trial enrollment was 18.2 months
with an estimated 3-year OS of 57%. Furthermore,
encouraging results have been reported in a phase 1
trial of i.p. topotecan combined with i.v. carboplatin
and paclitaxel as first-line treatment in 21 women
with advanced ovarian cancer; median PFS, measured from diagnosis, was 27 months.33 Although
derived from small preliminary studies, these data
suggest that i.p. topotecan may be more effective
than i.v. topotecan in this patient population and
warrant further investigation.
Acknowledging that the data analysis is limited
because of the small sample size, the median PFS
from this study is comparable to other consolidation
regimens. For example, a pilot study conducted in
13 patients who received paclitaxel as consolidation
therapy after a first-line regimen of carboplatin,
paclitaxel, and gemcitabine demonstrated a median
PFS of 19 months.34 A large SWOG/GOG intergroup
study with paclitaxel as consolidation therapy in
patients with advanced ovarian cancer reported a
median PFS of 21 and 28 months in the 3- and 12cycle arms, respectively.35 These data suggest that a
brief course of i.p. topotecan may be comparable to
other consolidation treatment options for advanced
ovarian cancer.
Earlier studies demonstrated that toxicity associated with topotecan therapy diminished in successive treatment cycles.36,37 In addition, the toxicities
were derived from interindividual (5 fold) and, to a
lesser extent, intraindividual (17%-20%) variation in
topotecan clearance.36,37 This pharmacokinetic learning curve associated with topotecan toxicity was also
apparent in the present study. Fifty percent of
patients required a dose delay after the first cycle of
treatment because of myelosuppression. However,
these patients completed subsequent scheduled
treatments on time at acceptable dose levels. Additional studies may be required to provide the
basis for individual dose adjustment required in this
setting.
Some investigators are concerned that consolidation therapy may expose patients to additional toxicity in comparison with waiting to treat patients at
the time of relapse.38 This important concern can
only be addressed by phase 3 trials. Nevertheless, in
our pilot study, i.p. topotecan appears to be a feasible option for consolidation treatment in patients
with advanced ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers. Future studies are warranted to determine an
optimal strategy for incorporating i.p. topotecan into
the management of women with advanced ovarian
and primary peritoneal cancers.
