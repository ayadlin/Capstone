BACKGROUND: Solitomab is a novel, bispecific, single-chain antibody that targets epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on tumor cells and also contains a cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (T-cell coreceptor) binding region. The authors evaluated the in vitro
activity of solitomab against primary chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines as well as malignant cells in ascites. METHODS: EpCAM expression was evaluated by flow cytometry in 5 primary ovarian cancer cell lines and in 42 fresh ovarian tumor cell cultures in ascites from patients with mainly advanced or recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant disease. The potential activity of
solitomab against EpCAM-positive tumor cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, proliferation, and 4-hour chromium-release, cellmediated cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: EpCAM expression was detected by flow cytometry in approximately 80% of the fresh ovarian tumors and primary ovarian tumor cell lines tested. EpCAM-positive, chemotherapy-resistant cell lines were identified as resistant
to natural killer cell-mediated or T-cell–mediated killing after exposure to peripheral blood lymphocytes in 4-hour chromium-release
assays (mean6standard error of the mean, 3.6%60.7% of cells killed after incubation of EpCAM-positive cell lines with control bispecific antibody). In contrast, after incubation with solitomab, EpCAM-positive, chemotherapy-resistant cells became highly sensitive to
T-cell cytotoxicity (mean6standard error of the mean, 28.2%62.05% of cells killed; P<.0001) after exposure to peripheral blood lymphocytes. Ex vivo incubation of autologous tumor-associated lymphocytes with EpCAM-expressing malignant cells in ascites with solitomab resulted in a significant increase in T-cell activation markers and a reduction in the number of viable ovarian tumor cells in
ascites (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Solitomab may represent a novel, potentially effective agent for the treatment of chemotherapyC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) remains the gynecologic malignancy with the highest mortality rate.1 Approximately
66% of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis; and, unfortunately, the majority of patients will recur after
an initial response to the combination of maximal cytoreductive surgery and combined platinum-paclitaxel–based chemotherapy.2 The identification of novel therapies against chemotherapy-resistant/recurrent ovarian cancer remains a high
priority.
With the use of high-throughput genomic analysis, our group and others have recently evaluated the genetic fingerprints of primary and metastatic ovarian carcinoma with the hope of identifying novel molecular diagnostic and therapeutic markers.3-5 Those studies consistently demonstrated that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (also known as
tropomyosin 1[TROP-1] or tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 1 [TACSTD1]), a calcium-independent hemophilic cell adhesion molecule of 39 to 42 kD, as one of the top differentially expressed genes in all EOC types tested,
including serous, clear-cell, endometrioid, and poorly differentiated tumors.3,4
Briefly, the EpCAM gene is located on chromosome 4q and contains 9 exons.6 It encodes for a protein consisting of
an extracellular domain with 2 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a transmembrane, and a short cytoplasmic domain of

26 amino acids. EpCAM promotes cell adhesion, and the
formation of EpCAM-mediated adhesions has a negative
regulatory effect on adhesions conferred by cadherins.6,7
EpCAM is expressed at low levels on the basolateral and
intercellular surfaces of simple, pseudostratified, and transitional epithelia, including most epithelial tissues in the
female genital tract.8 The differentiation of tumor cells
from normal cells is facilitated by assessment of homogeneity of EpCAM on the tumor cell, its glycosylation, as
well as the level of EpCAM expression present.9 EpCAM
is known to play an important role in multiple cell functions, including cell signaling, migration, proliferation,
and differentiation. Recent evidence has linked increased
EpCAM expression to ovarian cancer progression.10 It is
noteworthy that, because of its high expression on the cell
surface of carcinomas, EpCAM represents an attractive
target for immunotherapy.6
In the last few years, several EpCAM (cluster of differentiation 326 [CD326])/CD3-bispecific antibodies
(BiTEs) have demonstrated the ability to eliminate established tumors, to redirect tumor-associated T cells for lysis
of metastatic human ovarian cancer tissue,11,12 and to
effectively treat a variety of metastatic cancers in multiple
murine models.13-15 Solitomab (MT110, AMG 110) is
an EpCAM/CD3-bispecific, single-chain antibody in development for the treatment of patients with multiple
solid tumors that express EpCAM (CD326).11 Solitomab
has demonstrated remarkable antitumor activity in preclinical ovarian tumor xenograft models because of its
ability to engage resting, polyclonal, CD8-positive and
CD4-positive T cells for highly potent, redirected lysis of
target tumor cells.
In the current study, we evaluated the in vitro activity of solitomab against multiple, primary, chemotherapyresistant EOC cell lines as well as unmanipulated malignant tumor cells in ascitic fluid from patients who mainly
had advanced-stage or chemotherapy-resistant ovarian
disease. Our results demonstrate impressive solitomab

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Sample Processing

All patients signed an informed consent form according to
institutional guidelines, and approval for this study was
obtained from the institutional review board. Ascitic fluid
samples were collected from 42 consecutive patients with
cytologically confirmed ovarian cancer at the time of
cytoreductive surgery or at the time of a diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis. The ascitic fluid samples from of all
patients were tested for the presence of EpCAM-positive
ovarian cancer cells using flow cytometry. Random samples of ascites also were plated into 6-well microtiter plates
for treatment using solitomab and a nonspecific control
antibody without prior processing. Cell numbers and viability were determined by flow cytometry as described
below. Also, in total, 5 primary ovarian cancer cell lines
were established after sterile processing of surgical biopsy
samples as described previously.16 All primary ovarian
cancer cell lines used in this study were identified as highly
resistant to multiple chemotherapy drugs in vitro, including carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and topotecan.16,17 Patient
characteristics for all ovarian cancer cell lines and ascitic
fluid effusates are described in Tables 1 and 2.
Ex Vivo Therapy of Malignant Ascitic Fluid
Samples

Malignant ascites from patients with ovarian cancer were
analyzed after ex vivo treatment with either solitomab
(EpCAM BiTE) or a control BiTE. The malignant ascites
were plated in duplicate onto a 6-well, flat microtiter plate
and were treated with solitomab (Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany) at a concentration of 1
lg/mL for 5 days. For the control condition, these ascites

induction of morphologic changes and the extent of cytotoxicity and also for evidence of T-cell activation and
induction of cytokine release as described below.

cytometry studies. An immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)-PE
antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif) was used as an
antibody isotype control for the anti-EpCAM antibody.
Detection of the immune cell fractions was accomplished

antibody. Analyses were conducted using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer with Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
T-Cell Stimulation Assay

Solitomab-induced T-cell activation was measured by
detecting CD25 protein surface expression and HLA-DR
expression on CD8-positive and CD4-positive T cells by
FACS analysis. Solitomab-mediated stimulation of T cells
was calculated according to the following formula: percentage of CD8-positive/CD25-positive expression5
(number of CD8-positive/CD25-positive cells/total number of CD8-positive cells)3100. Similarly, using the same
equation, the numbers of CD8-positive/HLA-DR-positive
cells, CD4-positive/CD25-positive cells, and CD4-positive/HLA-DR-positive cells were calculated.
Cytokine Analysis

The level of solitomab-dependent cytokine induction was
compared with the corresponding percentage of cytokine
release in the control nonspecific antibody wells. This was
performed by treating the solitomab and control nonspecific antibody wells with phorbol myristate acetate and
ionomycin followed by a 3-hour incubation period to
allow for lymphocyte stimulation. Brefeldin A was added,
and a further incubation for 3 hours was used to enhance
intracellular cytokine staining signals. Cytokine analysis
of the supernatants was performed using FACS analysis
after adding anti-CD8–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
antibody for surface staining followed by fixation, permeabilization, and intracellular staining with antiinterleukin-4 (IL-4)-PE antibody and anti-interferon c
(IFNc)-PE antibody. Solitomab-mediated release of each
of these cytokines was calculated according to the following exemplary formula: percentage of CD8-positive/
IFNc-containing cells5(number of CD8-positive/IFNc
cells/total number of CD8-positive cells)3100. Similar
calculations were performed for CD4-positive T cells (ie,
gated CD3-positive/CD8-negative T cells).
Proliferation Assay of Tumor-Associated
T Lymphocytes After the Addition of EpCAM
BiTE by Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester
Cell Proliferation

Briefly, ascitic cells were harvested, washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately stained with
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (CellTrace
CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif)
at a working concentration of 10 lM. The CFSE-labeled
cells were plated and cultured in the presence of control
BiTE huMEC14 or solitomab for 5 days. Cells were col406

lected and labeled with CD8 and CD4 (Becton Dickinson) and were analyzed on a flow cytometer
(FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson) using SciQuest software (SciQuest Inc., Cary, NC). The percentages and
numbers of CD8-positive and CD4-positive T cells in the
control BiTE wells versus the solitomab-treated wells
were calculated after analysis by flow cytometry to determine tumor-associated T-lymphocyte (TAL) proliferation
induced in this coculture system.
Tests for T-Cell–Mediated Cytotoxicity

The standard 4-hour chromium (51Cr)-release assay was
used to measure the cytotoxic reactivity of Ficoll-Hypaque–
separated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from several
healthy donors against all 5 OSC cell lines at effector-totarget (E:T) ratios of 10:1 and 20:1. The release of 51Cr
from target cells was measured as evidence of tumor cell
lysis after exposure of the tumor cells to a concentration of
1 lg/mL solitomab. The negative control conditions were
an incubation of target cells either alone or with PBLs without BiTE antibody. For a positive control condition, 1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate was used to achieve the complete
lysis of target cells. The control BiTE huMEC14 at 1 lg/
mL was used as a negative control for solitomab in this bioassay. The control BiTE antibody shares the CD3-binding
arm with solitomab but otherwise recognizes an herbicide
as an irrelevant antigen instead of recognizing EpCAM.
The percentage cytotoxicity of solitomab was calculated
according to the following formula: % cytotoxicity5
1003(E2S)/T2S), where E is the experimental release, S
is the spontaneous release by effector cells, and T is the
maximum release by target cells lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.
Statistics

Differences in EpCAM expression by flow cytometry
were analyzed using the unpaired t test. The unpaired t
test also was used to evaluate the differences in antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity levels in primary tumor
cell lines treated with solitomab versus control BiTE
huMEC14-treated cells. An increase in T-cell activation
and the release of cytokines were analyzed using the t test
for paired data. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). A P value <.05
was considered the level of statistical significance.

ovarian cell lines (including 4 cell lines that were established from patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease)16,17 and in 42 ascitic fluid samples collected from
patients with advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma. Tables 1
and 2 list the characteristics of the patients from whom
the samples were collected along with the percentage of
EpCAM-positive cells and corresponding mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in primary ovarian carcinoma cell
lines and 42 ascitic fluid samples determined by flow
cytometry. Among the primary cell lines, the percentage
of EpCAM-positive cells and EpCAM expression levels
were high in OSC ARK-1, OSC ARK-2, CC ARK-2, and
A(PL)10 cells (Table 1). In contrast, low to negligible
EpCAM expression was observed in OSC ARK-3 cells.
Among the freshly collected ascitic fluids, 36 of 42 samples (85.7%) harbored EpCAM-positive tumors cells (the
cutoff level for EpCAM tumor positivity was set arbitrary
at 1% EpCAM-positive tumor cells in the ascitic population). The percentage of EpCAM-positive cells in ascitic
samples varied from 1% to 92.9%, whereas the minimum
to maximum MFI for EpCAM expression ranged from
95.6 to 4539.3 (Table 2). There were ascitic samples with
a very low percentage of EpCAM-positive tumor cells but
a very high MFI, as noted in Table 2. EpCAM expression
>1% in ascitic samples was sufficient to indicate a
response to with solitomab (Table 2, Fig. 3).

Figure 1. This is a cytotoxicity titration graph of solitomab
(an epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]/cluster of differentiation 3 [CD3] bispecific antibody [BiTE]) for OSC
ARK-1 ovarian carcinoma cells. Doses from 0 to 2.5 lg/mL
were used in several cytotoxicity experiments to determine
the optimum dose of solitomab. From these experiments, 1
lg/mL emerged as the optimum concentration.

Ovarian Carcinoma Cell Lines Are Resistant to
Natural Killer Cell Activity but Sensitive to
Solitomab-Mediated T-Cell Cytotoxicity

First, standard 4-hour chromium (51Cr)-release assay cytotoxicity titration was performed using solitomab
(EpCAM BiTE) at doses from 0 to 2.5 lg/mL in several
experiments with the objective of determining the optimum dose of solitomab. From these experiments, the 1lg/mL concentration emerged as the optimum solitomab
concentration for tumor killing (Fig. 1). All 5 primary
ovarian cancer cell lines were evaluated for their sensitivity
to natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. These cell lines
were exposed to PBLs collected from multiple healthy
donors in several cytotoxicity assays. These PBLs typically
contain between 20% and 25% CD8-positive T cells and
from 10% to 20% NK cells (CD56-positive/CD16-positive cells).
Ovarian cancer cell lines were identified as highly resistant to NK cell-mediated and T-cell-mediated killing
with exposure to PBLs at E:T ratios of 1:10 and 1:20
(mean6standard error of the mean [SEM], 3.6%60.7%
of cells killed; range, 0%-12.7% of cells killed after incubation of EpCAM-positive cell lines with control BiTE).

Coculture of Solitomab (EpCAM BiTE) and TALs
Triggers T-Lymphocyte Proliferation
and Cytotoxicity in a Potentially
Immunosuppressive Environment

T-lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxicity were evaluated after coculturing for 5 days of EpCAM-positive tumor cells with solitomab and autologous TALs with
freshly collected ascitic fluid samples. We used CFSE and
anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies to label lymphocytes
and anti-EpCAM antibodies to label tumor cells to be
counted by flow cytometry. At baseline, we observed a
larger percentage of CD4-positive T cells in the ascites
compared with CD8-positive T cells (mean percentage6
standard deviation: CD4, 39.1%615.4%; CD8,
23.8%611.8%; ratio, 1.6). Incubation with solitomab,
compared with control BiTE, significantly increased
CD8-positive T-cell numbers in ascitic fluid cultures
(CD4, 15.4%613.1%; CD8, 33.1%623.7%; control
BiTE vs solitomab, respectively; P5.03). The activated T
lymphocytes primed for tumor cell destruction by solitomab (see Results below) also had a change in their morphologic appearance, because T lymphocytes in the
solitomab coculture appeared larger than those in the control BiTE (data not shown). Incubation with solitomab
increased CD4-positive T-cell numbers in most of the ascitic cultures compared with control BiTE (26.9626.3 vs
42.2626.1 T cells; control BiTE vs solitomab, respectively), approaching statistical significance (P5.06).
The environment of ascitic fluid is one of potential
immune tolerance, because depressed immune responses
are commonly observed in patients with advanced cancer.
It has been demonstrated that serum and ascites from

patients with various types of cancer contain factors that
cause a nonspecific suppression of various T-lymphocyte
and B-lymphocyte responses and of NK cell activity. In
light of this, the ability of solitomab to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic activity in the immunotolerant ascitic fluid environment cannot be understated.
Incubation for 5 days with solitomab significantly
decreased the number of EpCAM-positive tumor cells in
freshly collected ascitic fluid samples derived from
patients who harbored advanced/recurrent disease
(decrease of EpCAM-positive tumor cells: solitomab vs
control BiTE: mean6SEM, 35.7%627.1%; range,
2.6%-74.4%, P<.0001) (Fig. 3). Figure 4 provides a representative photomicrograph of control BiTE-treated ascites versus solitomab-treated ascites under the

tumor cells in the plate was detected in these experiments.

Next, we explored whether solitomab was capable of

DISCUSSION
EOC is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in the United States. Greater than 65% of women
will present with advanced-stage disease and many of
these patients will eventually develop recurrent disease
and die from chemotherapy-resistant tumors. The development of novel therapies that are effective in the treatment of recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer
remains an unmet medical need.
BiTE antibodies are single-chain, bispecific antibody constructs with specificity for CD3 on T cells and a
surface antigen on tumor cells. By bridging cytotoxic T
cells and cancer cells, BiTE antibodies are capable of
mounting a T-cell response that is not restricted by Tcell–receptor specificity, the presence of major histocompatibility complex class I, generation and presentation of
peptide antigen, or the need for T-cell costimulation. In
the current study, we explored the potential of solitomab,
an EpCAM/CD3 BiTE, as a novel therapeutic strategy
against chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer cells.
We initially evaluated EpCAM expression in multiple primary ovarian cancer cell lines obtained from
patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease and in free
ovarian cancer cells and spheroids that were formed in
vivo in the ascitic fluid from ovarian cancer patients. Consistent with our previous results,16,17 we observed that
410

EpCAM was overexpressed in the majority of cell lines
and ascitic fluid samples.
It is noteworthy that the primary ovarian cancer cell
lines that overexpressed EpCAM were highly susceptible
to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by
solitomab. The cytotoxic activity of solitomab against a
human colon cancer cell line and metastatic ovarian cancer cells in the presence of PBLs was demonstrated previously by Schlereth et al.12 In our study, we have extended
the results of Schlereth et al by evaluating the cytotoxic
potential of solitomab against multiple biologically
aggressive and highly chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines with serous and clear cell histology. We
observed that all primary ovarian tumors tested that had
high EpCAM expression were highly susceptible to
solitomab-mediated T-cell killing in the presence of effector cells, whereas negligible cytotoxicity was detected in
the cell line with low levels of EpCAM surface expression.
It is also worth noting that, although all EpCAM-positive
cell lines were resistant to NK-cell cytotoxic activity (ie,
average killing at 20:1 E:T ratio in controls, 3.6%),
solitomab-mediated T-cell cytoxicity resulted in killing of
up to 50% in 4-hour 51Cr release assays. In contrast to
previous reports in which significant cytotoxicity was
reported only after 24 to 48 hours of PBL-solitomab exposure in the presence of EpCAM-positive tumor cells,12
in the current study, we were able to demonstrate high levels of T-cell cytotoxicity against chemotherapy-resistant
ovarian tumor cells after tumor cells were exposed to solitomab for only 4 hours. These findings are most likely
explained by the known higher sensitivity of cytotoxicity
assays based on chromium release (used in our experiments) compared with flow-cytometric assays based on
propidium-iodide–positive cells.12
More important, we have also demonstrated that
large amounts of ovarian tumor cells present as a single
cell suspension or as tumor spheroids in the ascitic fluid
from patients with ovarian cancer who harbor advanced
or chemotherapy-resistant disease are also highly sensitive
to solitomab-mediated cytotoxicity. These results were
obtained by adding solitomab to the freshly collected tumor cells and TALs present in ascitic fluid samples in the
absence of any immunostimulatory cytokine and, thus,
may provide a preview of the effects of solitomab on
advanced-stage ovarian cancer in vivo, particularly when
administered intraperitoneally.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that solitomab
is highly active at low E:T ratios. It is noteworthy that, in
addition to triggering cytotoxicity, solitomab also was capable of inducing significant CD8-positive T-lymphocyte

proliferation, expression of activation markers, and cytokine production in both autologous CD8 and CD4 TALs
present in ascitic fluid samples from heavily pretreated
patients with ovarian cancer.
For largely unknown reasons, T-cell responses are
blunted for patients in later stages of ovarian cancer.18
Although several reports have demonstrated that the infiltration of ovarian cancers with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlates with better survival, a large number of
studies have revealed that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
and TALs in tumor tissues or ascitic fluid are frequently
anergic and/or tolerogenic against autologous tumor
cells.18-21 It is worth noting that, in our experiments with
minimally manipulated, EpCAM-positive tumor cells, we
were able to demonstrate that all autologous TAL populations tested were able to significantly reduce the size and
integrity of ovarian tumor spheroids floating in the ascitic
fluid when exposed to solitomab. Taken together, these
data suggest that even partially tumor-anergic T cells in
ascitic fluid may become activated by solitomab and
mount a cytotoxic T-cell response capable of killing
chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer tumor cells.
The widespread expression and membranous
localization of EpCAM in ovarian cancer cells, combined with its negative expression in mesothelial type
cells in the abdominal cavity, suggest that this protein
could represent an accessible tumor target antigen for
both intravenous and intraperitoneal antibody/BiTEbased therapies. Consistent with this view, a phase 1
study of EpCAM/CD3-bispecific antibody (MT110) in
patients harboring advanced tumors is currently
ongoing.22 The first clinical intraperitoneal application
of a trifunctional anti-EpCAM antibody (catumaxomab; Removab, Fresenius Biotech GmbH, Munich,
Germany) recently demonstrated effective tumor cell
destruction, substantially decreased ascites accumulation, and reduced necessity of paracentesis in patients
with advanced ovarian carcinoma who harbored malignant tumors and were refractory to salvage chemotherapy.23 Consequently, catumaxomab has recently
received market approval by the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) for this indication.
There is a strong need for effective, novel targeted
therapies in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer. The current results clearly demonstrate that
solitomab may represent a novel, potentially highly effective targeted agent for the treatment of chemotherapyresistant ovarian cancer patients with tumors that overexpress Ep-CAM/TROP-1, particularly when administered
in the abdominal cavity. The future design and impleCancer

determine the validity of this novel therapeutic approach.
