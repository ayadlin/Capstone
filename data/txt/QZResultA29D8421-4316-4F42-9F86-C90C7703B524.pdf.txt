ABSTRACT
It is hypothesised that Wilms tumour (WT) results from aberrant renal
development due to its embryonic morphology, associated undifferentiated precursor
lesions (termed nephrogenic rests) and embryonic kidney-like chromatin and gene
expression profiles. From the study of overgrowth syndrome-associated WT, germline
dysregulation was identified in the imprinted region at 11p15 affecting imprinted
genes IGF2 and H19. This is also detected in ~70% sporadic cases, making this the
most common somatic molecular aberration in WT. This review summarises the critical
discussion at an international workshop held under the auspices of The European
Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents (ENCCA) consortium,
where the potential for drug development to target IGF2 and the WT epigenome was
debated. Here, we consider current cancer treatments which include targeting the
IGF pathway and the use of methylation agents alone or in combination with other
drugs in clinical trials of paediatric cancers. Finally, we discuss the possibility of the
use of these drugs to treat patients with WT.

INTRODUCTION

IGF2 pathway (69% of all WTs) and the p53 pathway
(anaplastic WTs, 5-10% of all WTs). At least in part,
these may be responsible for the heterogeneity in clinical
phenotype and outcome observed in WTs.
Under the auspices of the European Network for
Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents (ENCCA)
consortium, a European Union Framework 7-funded
program (http://www.encca.eu/Pages/home.aspx) a
‘Biology Driven Drug Development Renal Tumors
Workshop’ was convened to review the evidence for
the genetic pathways disrupted in WT and to develop a
translational research strategy. This workshop was part
of a wider strategic initiative to involve international
experts in the biology of childhood cancers, drug
development and early phase clinical trials in children
and relevant adult diseases, to accelerate biology-driven

Wilms tumour (WT) or nephroblastoma is the
most frequent renal tumor of childhood affecting one in
10,000 children, with a peak incidence between two and
three years of age [1]. With an overall cure rate ≥85%,
WT is one of the successes of pediatric oncology. In the
Western world, the majority of patients affected by WT
are treated within trials conducted by the International
Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP, Europe) or the
Children’s Oncology Group (COG, formerly NWTSG,
North America) [2]. WTs are frequently large and exhibit
radiological, macroscopic and histological heterogeneity.
At present, there is evidence of at least three pathways
that are associated with WT development: the WNT/βcatenin pathway (15-20% of non-anaplastic WTs), the

drug development and clinical trials across Europe. The
outcome of this workshop is being published as two
focused reviews. The first discussed the significance
of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in a subset of
WTs and related therapeutic opportunities [3]. Here, we
discuss the subset of WTs with epigenetic aberrations at
11p15 resulting in activation of the IGF signaling pathway
and the therapeutic opportunities provided by targeting
either the IGF pathway or the epigenome. The IGF
pathway is comprised of a complex network of molecules
stimulated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which
are synthesized by almost any tissue in the body and
are important mediators of growth, development, and
survival including the embryonic kidney [4]. There are
an increasing number of studies highlighting their role
in establishing a transformed phenotype in an increasing
number of malignancies.

identification of a network of genes that showed the
same “bivalent” chromatin structure (both active and
repressive marks simultaneously) and low expression in
both WT and ESCs, but were actively expressed in NK,
led to the conclusion that developmental arrest occurs in
undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme as the genes
required for differentiation (FOXD1 and LHX1 which
are involved in stromal and epithelial differentiation,
respectively) remained in a poised state awaiting
differentiation signals [9]. This evidence suggests that
retaining epigenetic features of early renal development is
important in the early stages of disease.
Supporting this theory, aberrant epigenetic
events have been considered as the earliest events in
tumourigenesis whereby epigenetic disruption results
in a pool of tumour-progenitor cells. Within these
cells, gene-specific epimutations can occur resulting in
cellular transformation [10, 11]. Tumours later acquire
both epigenetic and genetic plasticity that is proposed
to lead to tumour heterogeneity [12]. Therefore, whilst
during normal development, epigenetic modifications
are remodelled to define embryo patterning and for
organ and cell type specification and then upon terminal
differentiation is maintained to sustain cell identity,
when disrupted (during development or somatically),
the epigenome may play a role in cancer initiation and
progression, giving the same effect as a “classical” DNA
mutation.

Wilms tumours arise from aberrant renal
development and show epigenetic features of
embryonic kidney
WT is an embryonic tumour that morphologically
resembles foetal kidney with varying proportions of
blastemal, epithelial and stromal cells. Immature tubular
structures are observed and in some cases skeletal, fat
and muscle tissue suggesting a multipotent cell of origin
[5]. Concurrent with its embryonal morphology, gene
expression profiling has established that WTs express
genes corresponding to the earliest stage of metanephric
development and under-express genes from later stages
of renal development [6]. Furthermore, the cellular
composition of WT shows retention of expression patterns
reflecting embryonic counterparts [7] Evidence has shown
that depending on the location of expression of key renal
development gene CITED1, WT cell lines obtain either
stem-like properties (cytoplasmic expression, as seen in
normal development) or tumourigenic properties (nuclear
expression, as seen in WT) [8].
More recent studies have analysed the WT
epigenome, which encompasses features that effect gene
expression without altering the genetic coding sequence,
and found similar results. Epigenetic mechanisms can be
broadly classified into chromatin remodelling (by covalent
histone modification or protein binding) and DNA cytosine
methylation. In detail, researchers identified regions of
open chromatin that permit active gene expression (with
histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation [H3K4me3]) and regions
of closed chromatin that prevent gene expression (with
H3K27me3) in WT, embryonic kidney (EK), embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) and normal kidney (NK).
Comparisons between tissues identified open
chromatin structures in WT but not NK at genes
involved in kidney and mesoderm development which
are also highly expressed in foetal kidney. In addition,

Epigenetics of Wilms tumour
Aside from the developmental epigenetic features
observed in WT, further aberrant epigenetic events have
been observed that are analogous to this “classical”
DNA mutation (summarised in Table 1). These occur
by aberrant site-specific or global changes in DNA CpG
methylation or chromatin structure. In detail, CpG sites
are regions of DNA where a cytosine is located next to a
guanine nucleotide. In general, gain of DNA methylation
at CpG residues can result from the overexpression of
DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and
DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3b),
which are regulated by TP53 [13, 14]. As well as increase
in DNA methylation, trimethylation of histone 3 (H3) at
lysine (K) 27 (H3K27me3) also causes gene repression
by promoting a closed chromatin structure. Alternatively,
loss of DNA methylation, trimethylation of H3K4 or
K36, monomethylation of H3K4 or acetylation of H3K36
promote an open chromatin structure, and the binding of
transcription factors [9, 15-19]. In cancer, these changes
in DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility are
associated with the silencing or the overexpression of
tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively
(reviewed in [20]).
Of the known epimutations in WT, epigenetic
aberration at 11p15 has received the most attention due

H19) contains differentially methylated domains (DMD)
and is located between IGF2 and H19 [32]. The ICR
comprises CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor, zinc finger
protein) binding sites and acts by regulating interactions
between both gene promoters and their shared enhancers
downstream of H19 [33]. CTCF protects the maternal
H19-ICR from de novo methylation in normal tissue [34];
however aberrant gain of methylation at this allele results
in silencing of H19 expression and transcription of IGF2
replicating the paternal allele.
Clinically, WT with LOI at 11p15 are associated
with perilobar nephrogenic rests (PLNRs), lesions
of retained embryonic renal tissue found towards the
periphery of the renal lobe, and with blastemal or
epithelial-predominant WTs [35, 36] and show increased
expression of IGF2. Increased expression of IGF2 results
in activation of the insulin signalling pathway. Binding
of insulin, IGF1 or IGF2 to the extracellular portion of
the insulin receptor (IR), IGF1R or hybrid receptor leads
to autophosphorylation of the β-subunit tyrosine kinase,
followed by the phosphorylation of additional tyrosine
residues. This leads to recruitment of insulin receptor
substrates (IRS)1 to IRS4 and other proteins, allowing
activation of the PI3K and mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways which lead to
unregulated protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and
cell growth, and prevention of apoptosis [37]. Therefore,
in WT, LOI is driving IGF2 overexpression and oncogenic
pathway activation in the cell.
Although constitutional 11p15 abnormalities are
found in a small proportion (3%) of patients with sporadic
WT (31)and in those with asymmetric overgrowth,

to its association with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
(BWS), a paediatric overgrowth disorder with germline
gain of methylation at 11p15 and functional relationship
with expression of imprinted genes IGF2 and H19 [21,
22]. There are over 40 human imprinted genes that
show parental allele-specific expression [23]. This
monoallelic expression tightly controls the levels of the
proteins encoded by imprinted genes, usually important
factors of embryonic growth, placental growth or adult
metabolism [24]. The regulation of imprinted genes is
largely dependent on DNA methylation marks, which are
laid down during embryological development of germ
cells. Once in place, the methylation status of precise
chromosomal regions, imprinting control regions (ICRs),
is read by either of two mechanisms, chromatin barrier
formation or untranslated RNAs, thereby ensuring that
only the maternal or paternal allele is expressed [25, 26].
Each imprinted gene is classified as maternal or paternal
according to the expressed allele. Misregulation of
imprinted gene expression (loss of imprinting [LOI]) is
seen frequently in a large variety of human tumours [27].
Specifically, LOI of IGF2 and H19 is seen in ~69% WT
either by gain of methylation at the H19-ICR (37%) or
by paternal UPD (32%) [28, 29]. Around 10-20% WT
patients have constitutional LOI at this locus [30, 31].

including BWS patients, not all develop WT, adding
evidence that a second aberrant event is required.
Supporting this hypothesis, a strong association between
pUPD at 11p15 and WT1 mutation as well as both
mechanisms of LOI at 11p15 and WTX mutation are found
[29, 30, 36]. Other genes that are commonly mutated in
around 30% of sporadic WT cases include WTX, CTNNB1,
HACE1, LIN28A, DROSHA and FBXW7 although the total
number of known mutated genes in WT is limited [38-43].

particularly in those with blastemal predominance [44].
Subsequently a mouse model was developed whereby
upregulation of Igf2 was achieved through IGF1R
signalling transduced via pIRS1 and pERK1/2. This
upregulation alone was insufficient to cause WT, however
in combination with WT1 mutation (present in around 15%
WT), 64% of engineered mice developed WT [45]. The
resulting WT is probably due to the alteration in normal
differentiation of the induced nephrogenic mesenchyme
caused by WT1 mutation together with increased IGF
signalling driving proliferation of these cells. This showed
that although 11p15 defects are one of the most common
8017

Potential for IGF2 pathway inhibition

aberrations in WT, additional events are necessary for WT
development.
Relating this epigenetic aberration to patient
treatment, in chemotherapy-naïve tumours, the stage
I favourable histology WT weighing less than 550g in
children younger than 24 months of age treated with
surgery alone showed a significant association between
LOH at 11p15, WT1 mutation and relapse [46]. This
finding is being tested in the current COG clinical trial
(AREN0532) and if validated, 11p15 methylation analysis
may be used to select patients with stage I favourable
histology WT who do not require adjuvant therapy [47].
In chemotherapy treated tumours, the relationship between
11p15 disruption and patient outcome remains to be
addressed.

Having establishing that the majority of WT,
independent of tumour histology [29, 36], are dependent
on the IGF signalling pathway it follows that treatment
strategies aimed at its inhibition may be useful in the
clinic. Currently there are no clinically available drugs
which target IGF2 directly although two small molecules
are currently under development, m-Cresol and Myristic
acid.
Instead, the IGF2 receptor, IGF1R, seems to be the
most viable therapeutic target due to its redundancy in
normal growth and its role in tumorigenesis and growth
in cancer [48]. Approaches to targeting IGF1R activity
include impeding expression, blocking IGF1R interaction

Figure 1: A summary of agents that target either the IGF pathway or the epigenome. IGF signalling occurs through stimulation

of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors (IGF1R; shown in blue in the cell membrane) by IGF2 and results in activation of the PI3K and
MAPK signalling pathways, an increase in protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, cell growth and avoiding apoptosis. Activation of the
IGF pathway through overexpression of IGF2 is frequently seen in Wilms tumour (WT) and is therefore a viable therapeutic target. IGF
pathway inhibitors include antisense oligonucleotides which target IGF1R mRNA (green) to prevent their translation into functional protein
or molecules that target the IGF1R, which include AMG-479 in combination with Gemcitabine, BMS-754807, Figitumumab, IMC-A12
(alone or with Gemcitabine), NVP-AEW541 and R1507. As frequent epigenomic aberrations are also found in WT (see main text and
Table 1) targeting enzymes that regulate DNA methylation (DNA methyal transferases; DNMT) or that regulate histone modifications
(histone deacetylases; HDAC) may be a viable therapy for patients with WT. In terms of targeting the epigenome, 5-azacytidine, 5-aza2’-deoxycytidine and Zebularine are DNMT inhibitors and Vorinostat and Romidepsin are both HDAC inhibitors, preventing normal
enzymatic activity.

with its ligands or preventing receptor activation (Figure
1). There is also novel evidence suggesting that reduction
in dietary protein intake may inhibit tumour growth
possibly through the inhibition of the IGF/AKT/mTOR
pathway [49].
Impeding expression involves targeting IGF1R
mRNA using antisense oligonucleotides complementary
to the translational start site. Expression of such
oligonucleotides in glioblastoma cell lines inhibited
IGF1 mediated growth in culture [50] and showed a
pronounced growth-blocking effect in murine and human
cancer cell lines [51, 52]. In Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines,
after oligonucleotide delivery by plasmid transfection,
an increased response due to an increased sensitivity to
Doxorubicin was observed, suggesting a potential use in
combination therapy [53].
An alternative approach aims to block the
interaction between IGF1R and its ligands either with
small molecule inhibitors or using monoclonal antibodies.
There are several fully humanised anti-IGF1R monoclonal
antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of IGF1R in
various stages of clinical development, including in
the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). The
IGF1R inhibitor BMS-754807 is an ATP-competitive
small molecule that was tested in vivo using xenograft
models of several paediatric tumours (including WT) and
demonstrated significant growth delay [54]. The antiIGF1R monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 was also used
to treat the same WT models but showed very limited
efficacy as a single agent [55]. The data is insufficient to
draw firm conclusions as neither study evaluated IGF1R
network status in the cells. In WT cell lines growing in
the kidney environment, the use of the IGF1R inhibitor
NVP-AEW541 resulted in growth inhibition associated
with down-regulation of PI3K and MAPK pathways and
down-regulation of cell cycle control genes CCNA2 and
CCNB1, with drug efficacy dependent on the levels of
phosphorylated IGF1R [56]. Two anti-IGF1R antibodies,
Figitumumab (CP-751,871) and R1507, have shown
success in patients with Ewing’s sarcoma and thymoma
but have not yet been tested in WT patients or animal
models [57, 58]. As well as its role in the IGF pathway
as a tyrosine kinase, evidence shows that IGF1R also has
kinase-independent activity suggesting that combination
targeting using both antibodies that target the receptor as
well as small molecule inhibitors may be more effective
[59].
The lack of response in some IGF2-overexpressing
WT may be due to the cancer cells overcoming their
dependence on IGF signalling, or that the IGF pathway
is not the sole dominant driver, thus suggesting that
combination therapies may be more effective. In fact,
in vivo studies of IGF1R antibody AMG-479 with
gemcitabine showed additive inhibitory activity in
pancreatic carcinoma [60]. Combined inhibition of the
mTOR and IGF1R signalling pathways is an attractive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and biologically rational approach to development of
anticancer therapy for sarcomas and other solid tumours.
Separately, both pathways appear to be relevant in
multiple forms of cancer, and preclinical models suggest
synergistic antitumor activity with combined inhibition
of these pathways. The PPTP has demonstrated that the
combination of IGF1R inhibitor IMC-A12 and mTORC1
signalling inhibitor rapamicin have a superior tumour
response compared to either agent alone in several
models of paediatric cancer, however testing has not
been carried out in the WT model [61]. In human WTs,
overexpression of IGF2, through allele loss of 11p15.5
or loss of imprinting, frequently co-exists with WT1
mutation. The same combination of critical genetic events
proved essential for tumour formation in a genetically
engineered mouse model [45]. ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was upregulated in WTs in both species, suggesting a
further target for therapy.
Unfortunately, some drugs that target the IGF
pathway, when tested in clinical trials have not given
encouraging results. Amgen (Amgen Inc. CA, USA)
recently terminated ganitumab (AMC-479 [62]), an
antibody against IGF1R, for a late-stage pancreatic cancer
trial [63]. Earlier in 2010, Pfizer abandoned figitumumab
after trials failed to show clinical efficacy in adult cancers
(lung carcinoma and myeloma). Several other drug
manufacturers have discontinued their own earlier-stage
programs directed at the same target. However, Merck are
still developing an IGF1R inhibitor dalotuzumab, with an
emphasis on the identification of predictive biomarkers for
subgroups that benefit most from this drug and Eli Lilly
has an IGF1R-targeted antibody, cixutumumab, in phase
2 trials. COG recently carried out a randomised phase 2
study testing cixutumumab in adolescents and children
with refractory solid tumours including ten patients with
WT. The drug was well tolerated in patients and prolonged
stable disease was seen in 15% patients [64]. Although
no response in patients with refractory WT was observed,
this was a single-agent trial and drugs that only target
IGF1R may be non-efficacious as they fail to target the
insulin receptor, another tyrosine kinase receptor that is
activated by IGF1 and IGF2 in addition to insulin itself.
Following this idea, Astellas Pharma developed a drug,
linsitinib which is undergoing phase 2 trials for several
tumour types, that targets both receptors. The observed
poor response may be due to the complexity of the IGF1R/
insulin receptor system and parallel growth and survival
pathways. However, IGF1R does remain a valid target
for selected tumour types and agents targeting IGF1R are
attractive therapeutic targets for WT.
An alternative approach to overcome the potential
side effects of inhibiting the whole IGF pathway is the
inhibition of specific arms of the pathway important for
tumour development. The monoclonal antibody mAb
1/41 targets the metalloproteinase, pregnancy-associated
plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) resulting in indirect inhibition
8019

Oncotarget

of IGF signalling [65]. Tumours with increased PAPP-A
activity will benefit from the use of mAb 1/41 with the
advantage of local and indirect targeting of the IGF-IR,
rather than global targeting which lacks specificity and is
likely to interfere with metabolism [66], however there is
no information in the literature about PAPP-A activity in
WT.

mechanisms. They can cause multiple side effects anorexia, nausea, vomiting, suppression of white blood
cells and thrombocytopenia, and profound fatigue [75].
DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) 1, 3a and 3b
are enzymes that transfer a methyl group to cytosine
residues in DNA. DNMT1 maintains methylation during
DNA synthesis whereas 3a and 3b act during embryonic
development [76, 77]. A number of different types of
DNMT inhibitors are known including non-nucleoside
analogues which are antisense oligonucleotides targeting
the DNMT family of enzymes, resulting in DNA
demethylation. One such inhibitor underwent phase I and
phase II trials for treatment of renal cancer but failed due
to a lack of efficacy [78].
The more common inhibitors for DNMT are
nucleoside analogues that become phosphorylated and are
incorporated into DNA during replication also resulting
in global DNA demethylation. The DNMT inhibitors
Vidaza and Decitabine are the most successful epigenetic
drugs to date and are still the most widely used as
epigenetic modulators, even though their application for
oncological diseases is restricted by their relative toxicity
and poor chemical stability. Decitabine was approved
for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
in 2006 and shows anti-leukemic activity against acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). Its clinical activity against
solid tumours is under investigation, but initial studies
in patients with solid tumours have demonstrated only
limited responses. However, as there is a close correlation
between the concentration of Decitabine, exposure time,
demethylating effects and thus anti-tumour activity, these
patients potentially received a suboptimal exposure to the
drug compared to that expected from in vitro and in vivo
animal studies [79]. Zebularine (1-(β-D-ribofuranosyl)1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one), a more stable and less toxic
cytidine analog, is another DNMT inhibitor which also
shows inhibitory activity towards cytidine deaminase [80].
Zebularine preferentially targets cancer cells and exhibits
low toxicity toward normal cells and mice [81, 82].
Zebularine induces apoptosis and decreases clonogenic
capacity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines in
a dose-dependent manner [83]. Although it is orally
available and more stable than FDA-approved Vidaza and
Decitabine, its clinical benefit is yet to be evaluated.
As WT shows a triphasic morphology,
demethylating agents may show different activity in each
cell type however, as no evidence currently exists as to
whether one cell type may respond better, this would also
need to be assessed.
Finally, enhanced expression of EZH2 in WT,
a key polycomb group protein that functions to repress
transcription through critical histone 3 methylation
markers, has been identified to correlate with WT
progression [84]. Agents targeting EZH2 such as GSK126
have entered pre-clinical and clinical development [85,
86].

Therapeutic options based on the WT epigenome
It is now clear that cancer development depends
not only on genetic alterations but also on epigenetic
changes that convey heritable gene expression patterns
critical for neoplastic initiation and progression [67].
However, unlike genetic mutations which are permanent,
the discovery that these epigenetic marks can be reversed
by compounds targeting aberrant transcription factor/coactivator/co-repressor interactions and histone-modifying
activities, suggests the possibility that the epigenome of
cancer cells may be manipulated with potential therapeutic
benefits [68]. Given the proven dysregulation of epigenetic
architecture in WT and the pattern, interactions and
clinical associations of molecular events in WT there is
clear potential for targeting the epigenome to treat WT.
A significant and growing number of pharmaceutical
companies have research programs that aim to define
proteins that target the epigenome. Drugs currently
FDA approved or in the pipeline for approval for this
purpose include the DNA methyltrans­ferase inhibitors
5-azacytidine (Vidaza and AZA), 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine
(Decitabine, Dacogen and DAC), as well as two histone
remodelling inhibitors: suberanilohydroxamic acid
(Vorinostat, Zolinza) and depsipeptide (Romidepsin,
Istodax) [69], shown in Figure 1. More epigenetic drugs
are entering into pre-clinical development every year [70].
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical in the
control of gene expression. Molecules that interfere with
histone remodelling, for example histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi) are an emerging class of therapeutics
with potential as anticancer drugs with promising results
in clinical trials [71]. To date, two HDACi have received
FDA approval for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma: Vorinostat and Romidepsin. Clinical trials
assessing the effects of various HDACi on haematological
and solid malignancies are currently being conducted [72].
Despite the proven anticancer effects of particular HDACi,
a detailed understanding of how HDACi with different
pharmacological properties affect biological functions in
vitro and in vivo is still missing [73]. Therefore while drugs
that target histone remodelling proteins exist and have
been tested in both haematological and solid malignancies
[74], the potential efficacy of such inhibitors in WT is
unknown and unpredictable as no studies have revealed a
particular dependence on HDACs in WTs. In addition, the
potential downside of drugs that target global chromatin
modifications is their broad effect on fundamental cellular

CONCLUSIONS AND CHALLENGES

IGF1R expression are potential avenues for further
consideration.

Here, we have discussed a wide range of agents
that target the IGF signalling pathway or the epigenome
(summarised in Table 2). It is clear that epigenetic
alterations play a key role in a significant fraction of WTs
and result in LOI at H19/IGF2 [33]. This epimutation
has also been observed in the associated nephrogenic
rests (precursor lesions) and surrounding normal kidney
of patients with WT. Furthermore, other epigenetic
aberrations have been found within the tumour tissue
and it appears that the founding event in a large subset of
WTs is the failure to complete nephrogenesis, thus leaving
lesions with an epigenetically unstable composition.
Considering this evidence, WT seems at present to
be an ideal model for epigenetic therapy. While global
demethylators can be assessed for use as adjuvant therapy,
most of the epigenetic drugs under development require
effective cell proliferation, suggesting that they may only
be effective in a subset of tumours.
We have discussed the use of targeting IGF
signalling in WT as a possible therapeutic strategy. Most
importantly, the assessment of IGF signalling disruption
in clinical trials may help to identify the patient subgroup
most likely to benefit from treatment with pathway
inhibitors. Moreover, the COG study AREN0532, which
is currently analysing the relationship between 11p15
methylation in very low risk WT and patient outcome,
may support previous evidence that patients with 11p15
LOH are more likely to relapse which would aid future
patient stratification and treatment decision planning.
11p15 disruption and its association with outcome remains
to be addressed in pre-treated tumours.
At present, targeting IGF signalling has been tested
on WT cell lines and xenograft models which showed
significant growth delay. Given IGF2 overexpression in
WT, targeting IGF1R seems plausible. However, it must
be considered that tumours can overcome IGF pathway
dependence and therefore combination therapy might be a
more effective option, though the effective pathways to be
co-inhibited have not yet been defined. Furthermore, the
use of new epigenetic therapies needs to be established
before we can consider assessing efficacy in clinical trials.
Should this therapeutic approach be considered in the
future, the status of 11p15 imprinting would have to be
assessed at diagnosis to determine whether IGF-targeted
therapy would be beneficial for a patient, perhaps in the
same way that assessing ERBB2 status impacted on breast
cancer treatment. This can be done by methylation-specific
MLPA (MS-MLPA), a simple method based on digestion
of genomic DNA-probe hybrid complexes combined with
methylation-sensitive endonucleases. As a quantitative
method, MS-MLPA discriminates between methylation
of one, both or none of the alleles making it a powerful
screening tool [87]. Further clinical trials assessing IGF1R
inhibitors in vivo as well as mRNA therapy blocking
