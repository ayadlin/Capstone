ABSTRACT
Despite recent improvements, overall survival for advanced adenocarcinoma
of the pancreas continues to be poor. In comparison to other tumor types that have
enjoyed marked survival benefit by targeting aberrant cell signaling pathways,
standard of care treatment for pancreatic cancer is limited to conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Multiple pathway aberrations have been documented in pancreatic
cancer. A review of the COSMIC database reveals that most pancreatic cancers
contain somatic mutations, with the five most frequent being KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A,
SMAD4, and ARID1A, and multiple other abnormalities seen including, but not
limited to, mutations in STK11/LKB1, FBXW7, PIK3CA, and BRAF. In the era of
tumor profiling, these aberrations may provide an opportunity for new therapeutic
approaches. Yet, searching clinicaltrials.gov for recent drug intervention trials for
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, remarkably few (10 of 116 (8.6%)) new study protocols
registered in the last three years included a molecular/biomarker stratification
strategy. Enhanced efforts to target subsets of patients with pancreatic cancer in
order to optimize therapy benefit are warranted.

with gemcitabine. [8] This improvement was a modest 11
days compared to gemcitabine alone. Other targeted agents,
such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, and sorefenib, did not
improve overall survival in combination with gemcitabine.
[9–11] Trials with these agents were open to all patients with
pancreatic cancer, and there were no screening criteria to
select patients most likely to respond to the targeted agents.
Outside the field of pancreatic cancer, significant
advances in oncology therapy have emerged by identifying
and intervening upon “actionable” aberrations. Advanced
melanoma, which traditionally held a grave prognosis,
has undergone a renaissance in treatment options. For
the approximately 40% of patients that harbor a V600E
BRAF mutation, vemurafenib produces a response rate
of 48%. [12, 13] Dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor,
and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, have also substantially
improved outcomes in BRAF-mutant patients. [14, 15] In
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), median
survival with traditional platinum-doublet chemotherapy
is eight to nine months. [16] Targeting the EML4-ALK
fusion product (~5% incidence) with crizotinib, a smallmolecule kinase inhibitor, is associated with a survival

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth most lethal
malignancy in the United States, with 39,590 deaths
expected in 2014. [1] It is one of the few malignancies
where incidence approximates prevalence, as the disease
is almost uniformly fatal, often within one year (Table 1).
[2, 3] For patients who present with localized disease that
can be surgically removed, median survival is 22.8 months
due to the high-likelihood of recurrence. [4] Most patients
present with metastatic disease, and treatment options are
limited to chemotherapy. Median survival is about five to
seven months with single-agent gemcitabine, or 8.5–11
months with more intense regimens such as gemcitabine/
nab-paclitaxel and fluorouracil (5-FU)/irinotecan/
oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). [5–7]
Recent survival gains in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer have resulted from new combinations of
conventional, non-targeted chemotherapies, such as
FOLFIRINOX. [7] Only one targeted agent – erlotinib, a
small-molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of EGFR – has been
shown to improve overall survival (OS) when combined

of about 20 months. [17] Even erlotinib, whose effect
is modest in pancreatic cancer, can improve first-line
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFRmutations (about 8–30% depending upon ethnicity) from
4.6 to 13 months. [18–20] Further, a meta-analysis of the
NSCLC literature showed responses of 49% when targeted
treatments were matched to the appropriate subgroup of
patients, but only 9.7% when unselected populations were
treated. [21]
In this regard, a review of pancreas tumor specimens
within the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
(COSMIC) database reveals that most pancreatic cancers
harbor somatic mutations (Table 2), with the five most
frequent aberrations being KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A,
SMAD4, and ARID1A. [22, 23] If specific “actionable”
mutations can drive marked improvements in survival
in melanoma and NSCLC, similar opportunities might
reasonably be expected in pancreatic cancer. Herein we
review the molecular landscape in pancreatic cancer and
provide an overview of the status of current clinical trials
in the field.

early role in oncogenesis. [25] Thus, blocking targets
downstream of KRAS is of clinical interest.
One key target downstream of KRAS is MEK, which
functions as a protein kinase. Multiple MEK inhibitors are
in development, and some have shown promise (Table 3).
Selumetinib, a small-molecule MEK inhibitor, was
randomized against single-agent capecitabine as a secondline treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Though there
was no difference in overall survival, two of 38 (5.2%)
patients in the selumetinib arm achieved a partial response
(PR) [26]. Trametinib has also shown some activity. In a
treatment-refractory phase I population, two of 26 patients
(8%) achieved PR [27]. However, in a randomized phase II
trial with trametinib given in combination with gemcitabine
versus gemcitabine alone, response rate was 22% (but
included one complete remission) as compared to 18%;
survival was 8.4 versus 6.7 months (p, not significant).[28]
The fact that some patients respond to MEK inhibitors
alone is of interest, though combinations of MEK inhibitors
with gemcitabine do not substantially increase the response
rate. Whether or not MEK inhibitors in combination with
other regimens such as FOLFIRINOX might be beneficial
merits further study.

KRAS
Seventy-one percent of pancreatic cancer specimens
in the COSMIC database harbor KRAS mutations. [22]
KRAS is a key protein in multiple signaling pathways.
When bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), it
mediates cell survival and differentiation. Common KRAS
mutations hinder its ability to hydrolyze GTP, leaving it
constitutively active. [24] KRAS mutations are common
in pancreatic duct lesions and are thought to play an

TP53
Forty-nine percent of pancreatic cancers in the

state, enables cancerous cells to avoid apoptosis. Wee1 inhibitors such as MK1775 target aberrant p53 by
blocking cell cycle checkpoint regulation and increasing

susceptibility to cytotoxic chemotherapy. [29] In addition,
retrospective analysis by Said et al [30] suggested that
tumors with aberrant p53 may be more sensitive to
bevacizumab. Patients with aberrant p53 had a median
PFS of 11 months while the median PFS in those
with wild-type p53 was 5.0 months. On multivariate
analysis, the interaction between p53 mutation status and
bevacizumab therapy was statistically significant [HR
0.15, 95% CI 0.05–0.44, p < 0.001]. [30]
Of additional clinical interest is re-activating
p53 in wild-type patients. MDM2, an inhibitor of p53,
is overexpressed in many cancers. [31] MDM2–p53
interaction prompts p53 degradation and blocks its tumor
suppressor function. [31] Blocking MDM2 activity may
prevent this degradation, thereby enabling p53-induced
apoptosis of cancerous cells. [32] A search of clinicaltrials.

gov lists multiple MDM2 antagonists currently under
early-phase investigation, including RO5045337,
RO5503781, and DS-3032b. [33]

CDKN2A
CDKN2A is aberrant in twenty-two percent of
patients with pancreatic cancer. [22] It encodes multiple
proteins which play roles in tumor suppression. Two
transcripts, p16 and p14ARF, are frequently abnormal
in pancreatic cancer and result in loss of function. p16
inhibits the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6,
thereby playing a regulatory role in the cell cycle by
preventing phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor
retinoblastoma protein. [34] Loss of p16 results in
activation of CDK4/6 and is associated with high-grade

pre-malignant pancreatic lesions. [35] Palbociclib, an
inhibitor of CDK4/6, has been shown to suppress growth
of pancreatic cancer cell lines, though with upregulation
of genes associated with metastasis. [36] p14ARF is an
inhibitor of MDM2 and stabilizes retinoblastoma protein
by interfering with MDM2-mediated degradation. [37]
Theoretically, either CDK4/6 or MDM2 inhibitors might
be active in patients with loss of CDKN2A function.

BRCA2 is a potent tumor suppressor and plays a key
role in DNA repair. Murphy et al demonstrated that 5/29
patients (17%) with a strong family history of pancreatic
cancer harbored BRCA2 mutations. [44] PALB2, which
binds BRCA2, also plays a role in DNA repair. PALB2
mutations were reported in 3/96 patients (3.1%) with
familial pancreatic cancer. [45]
In theory, patients with BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations
should be more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. Two
case reports illustrate this point (Table 4). Villarroel et
al reported a 61-year-old man with metastatic pancreatic
cancer in the setting of a PALB2 mutation. [46] He
was initially treated with gemcitabine chemotherapy
(nucleoside analogue) with no response, but then
received mitomycin C chemotherapy (DNA crosslinker)
and achieved a partial response that lasted twenty-two
months. A 49-year-old woman with advanced pancreatic
cancer in the setting of BRCA2 mutation who was treated
with mitomycin C and capecitabine after progressing
through two previous regimens also achieved a partial
response. [47] Mitomycin C was discontinued after six
months due to toxicity. Patients with BRCA2 mutations
may also be sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Response
has been seen in a variety of other tumors, including
breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer harboring BRCA2
aberrations. [48]
Abberations in STK11/LKB1 and FBXW7 are
also potential targets. LKB1 acts through AMPK
to inhibit mTOR, which regulates cell growth. [49]

SMAD4
SMAD4 is a co-factor that facilitates gene
transcription and tumor suppression through the TGFbeta signaling pathway. SMAD4 mutations are present
in twenty percent of pancreatic cancers and have been
associated a poorer prognosis and increased metastases.
[22, 38, 39] Inactivation of SMAD4 may enable TGF-beta
signaling, which is usually suppressive, to promote cancer
growth. [40, 41] To our knowledge, the role of TGF-beta
inhibitors in patients with SMAD4 mutations has not been
investigated.

ARID1a
ARID1a mutations are present in six percent of
pancreatic cancers. [22] ARID1a plays a role in chromatin
remodeling, is thought to have tumor suppressor function,
and binds p53. [42] It also modulates signaling through the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. [43] Whether or not mutations in
ARID1a can be targeted by using PIK3CA, AKT or mTOR
inhibitors is currently unknown.

Germline STK11/LKB1 loss-of function mutations are
associated with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, which carries
an increased risk for pancreatic neoplasms. [49] A case
reported by Klumpen at al successfully used the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus in a Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome patient
with pancreatic cancer to obtain a partial response
without additional cytotoxic chemotherapy (Table 4).
[50] FBXW7 plays a role in the ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of oncoproteins, and among patients with
NSCLC, low FBXW7 expression is associated with
decreased survival and taxane resistance. In NSCLC
cell lines with silenced FBXW7, taxane sensitivity can
be restored when treated with the histone deacetylase
inhibitor MS-275. [51]
Other potentially actionable aberrations that
can be seen in small, but not insignificant subsets of
patients include PIK3CA and BRAF mutations. These
abnormalities occur in 2 to 3% of patients, and can
theoretically be targeted by PI3K/AKT/mTOR and BRAF
or MEK inhibitors, respectively.

conventional chemotherapy options, two sought patients
with BRCA mutations for PARP inhibitors, one required
a specific antigen for a corresponding investigational
monoclonal antibody, and one sought patients with a
specific HLA marker for a vaccine study. These results
suggest that there is still a remarkable paucity of
trials addressing molecular/biomarker stratification in
pancreatic cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
The outcome for patients diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer is grim, with one year survival of 19% and
4.8% alive at five years. [52] The best therapy to date
is FOLFIRINOX, and it improves median survival by
four months (from 6.8 to 11.1 months) compared to
gemcitabine for metastatic disease. [7] In other tumor
types such as BRAF-aberrant melanoma, or EGFR- or
ALK-aberrant NSCLC, significant improvements have
been achieved by matching targeted agents with patients
harboring the cognate molecular abnormality. Several
theoretically “actionable” aberrations exist in pancreatic
cancer including, but not limited to, KRAS, CDKN2A,
ARID1A, BRCA, PALB2, PIK3CA, BRAF and so forth.
Despite the number of aberrations that can be targeted,
relatively few have been addressed in clinical trials of
pancreatic cancer, with only about 9% of clinical trials
of pancreatic cancer stratified by a biomarker in the last
three years. Although an important step in pancreatic
cancer, as in EGFR- or ALK-mutant lung cancer or
BRAF-mutant melanoma might include investigation of
matched targeted monotherapy, many pancreatic tumors
likely contain more than one aberration. If two or more
genomic aberrations exist, the role of each might need
to be ascertained, and each important driver may need to
be targeted (customized combination therapy) in order to
prevent or circumvent resistance.[53, 54] Taken together,
the data suggests that efforts to target biomarker-defined
subsets of patients with pancreatic cancer in order to
optimize therapy benefit are warranted.

Clinical trials for pancreatic cancer
A search of clinicaltrials.gov for new pancreatic
cancer protocols registered during the past three years
identified 314 protocols (search criteria: trials registered
in database during the period 03/01/2011 to 03/01/2014;
pancreatic cancer; drug or biological intervention
studies). [33] The 314 protocol summaries were manually
reviewed, and protocols containing external radiotherapy,
neuroendocrine histology, and local therapy were
excluded, as were protocols without the stated outcome of
improved OS, PFS, or radiographic/biochemical response,
leaving only 116 specific for pancreatic adenocarcinoma
systemic therapy. Of these 116 protocols, 10 (8.6%)
used selective inclusion criteria to identify a subset of
patients based upon laboratory molecular/biomarker
data and treat with a cognate therapy that was believed
to impact or biologically match the biomarker. Six used
tissue biomarkers to assign patients among multiple
