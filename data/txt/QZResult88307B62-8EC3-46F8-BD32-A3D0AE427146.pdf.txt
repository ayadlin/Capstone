Abstract
Somatic mutations in FGFR2 are present in 4% to 5% of patients diagnosed with non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Ampliﬁcation and mutations in FGFR genes have been identiﬁed in patients with NSCLCs, and clinical
trials are testing the efﬁcacy of anti-FGFR therapies. FGFR2 and other FGFR kinase family gene alterations have
been found in both lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, although mouse models of FGFRdriven lung cancers have not been reported. Here, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of
NSCLC driven by a kinase domain mutation in FGFR2. Combined with p53 ablation, primary grade 3/4
adenocarcinoma was induced in the lung epithelial compartment exhibiting locally invasive and pleiotropic
tendencies largely made up of multinucleated cells. Tumors were acutely sensitive to pan-FGFR inhibition. This is
the ﬁrst FGFR2-driven lung cancer GEMM, which can be applied across different cancer indications in a
preclinical setting. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4676–84. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) currently remains the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; more than
200,000 new cases are diagnosed annually, of which only 16% of
patients survive longer than 5 years (1) NSCLC represents the
most common subtype of lung cancer and is composed of large
cell, squamous cell, and adenocarcinomas (2), all of which are
being intensely researched to further delineate their respective
oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets. In turn, there is a
signiﬁcant preclinical need for the development of novel
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that exploit
these potential "drivers" to further understand their underlying
biology and relevance as therapeutic biomarkers. Upon successful recapitulation of the human disease in the mouse,

researchers are able to test novel targeted therapeutics to
improve therapies for speciﬁc patient genotypes in NSCLCs.
FGFs and their cognate cell surface receptors comprise a large
signaling network, playing key roles in embryonic development
and normal tissue homeostasis via ligand binding of the extracellular domains in FGFRs. Aberrant activation of these receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) has been demonstrated in a variety of
cancer types. To date, FGFR1 ampliﬁcation and gene expression
has been the most commonly discovered, identiﬁed in 10%
of patients with breast carcinomas (3), approximately 20% of
patients with squamous cell lung cancers (4, 5), and 6% of
patients with small cell lung cancer (6). FGFR2 mutations have
been most highly represented in 12% of patients with endometrial carcinoma (7), both major subtypes of NSCLCs with the
squamous cell population displaying a higher rate of mutation
(8–10) and gastric tumors (11), as well. Somatic mutations in
FGFR3 have been most commonly observed in bladder carcinomas (12) and a serine to cysteine amino acid change at amino
acid 249 has been identiﬁed in 5% of invasive cervical carcinomas
(13). Similar to the case of EML4-ALK, activating chromosomal
translocations of FGFRs have begun to be identiﬁed in several
different cancer types, including bladder cancer (14), multiple
myeloma (15), lung squamous cell, thyroid, oral, head and neck
squamous, breast and prostate cancers, as well as cholangiocarcinoma and glioblastoma (16). FGFR2/3/4 mutations were
also identiﬁed in NSCLCs (8, 9) providing the rationale for the
creation of GEMMs driven by FGFR-dependent activity.
To date, several mouse models of lung tumorigenesis have
been generated that are driven by different FGF7 subfamily
members (FGF3/7/10). Each of these mouse models exhibited
epithelial hyperplasia with some providing adenomas, but none
of these models rendered an invasive cancer phenotype (17–19).

FGFR2 Kinase Domain Activation Drives Lung Adenocarcinoma

More recently, a group described an inducible mouse model
driven by FGF9 expression in the adult mouse lung (20). This
model was the ﬁrst to develop papillary adenomas, which
progressed to adenocarcinoma with the potential to metastasize and was dependent on a FGF9/FGFR3 signaling axis. Given
that FGF3/7/10 ligands predominantly signal through FGFR2
(21), the preclinical need for additional FGFR-driven models of
invasive carcinoma is needed, as mutations in all FGFRs have
been identiﬁed in various next-generation sequencing efforts in
various cancer indications, including NSCLCs (8, 9). In addition,
modes of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors related to
FGFR de-repression are also of interest. While there have been
many FGFR mutations identiﬁed in NSCLCs, limited knowledge
as to which are oncogenic drivers continues to be an obstacle.
As a result of data generated by TCGA analysis of lung squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, several potential key "drivers"
were uncovered. Of those, FGFR2 was of particular interest as it
is commonly mutated and/or ampliﬁed in patients with both
lung squamous cell and adenocarcinoma (8, 9). Upon further
evaluation of FGFR2, several key mutations in both the extracellular and kinase domains showed transforming capabilities
in vitro and in xenograft studies with profound sensitivity to
pan-FGFR inhibitors, such as BGJ-398 and AZD4547 (22). On the
basis of these ﬁndings and the clear void of mouse models of
human lung squamous cell carcinoma, here we report the
generation and characterization of FGFR2 mutant GEMMs
conditionally expressing an extracellular (W290C) or kinase
(K660N) domain activating mutation.

Materials and Methods
Generation and maintenance of transgenic mice
Point mutations W290C and K660N within human FGFR2's
cDNA (isoform IIIb) were introduced as described elsewhere
(22). In short, sequence-veriﬁed constructs were cloned into a
modiﬁed transgenic targeting vector (23). Sequence-veriﬁed
targeting vectors were co-electroporated with an FLPe recombinase plasmid into v6.5 C57BL/6J (female) x 129/sv (male)
embryonic stem cells (Open Biosystems) as described elsewhere (24). Resulting hygromycin-resistant embryonic stem
clones were evaluated for transgene integration via PCR. Then,
transgene-positive embryonic stem clones were injected into
black 6 blastocysts, and the resulting chimeras were mated
with BALB/c WT mice to determine germline transmission of
the FGFR2 transgene. FGFR2 transgenic mice were bred with a
p53 conditional knockout (Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox; Jackson Laboratories
#8462) model. For all studies, mice were on a mixed genetic
background and FGFR2 mutant mice were hemizygosed. Adenovirus-Cre (5  107 pfu; University of Iowa) was administered
intranasally to excise the loxP sites, activating mutant FGFR2
expression and inactivating p53 activity in the lung epithelial
compartment. All mouse experiments were performed with
the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA).
Mouse drug treatment studies
Upon signs of dyspnea, mice were imaged via MRI to document baseline tumor volumes. BGJ-398 (SelleckBio #S2183)

www.aacrjournals.org

was dosed orally 7 days a week (15 mg/kg in PEG300; refs. 22, 25).
Vehicle animals were treated with PEG300 alone (EMD). MRI
was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks throughout treatment.
Tumor volumes were quantiﬁed using 3D Slicer software as
described elsewhere (26).
Real-time PCRs
Total RNA was isolated from lung tissues/nodules using
TRIzol (Invitrogen #15596018) and processed through an RNA
cleanup step (Qiagen #74204) per manufacturers' instructions.
cDNAs were generated from resulting total RNA samples via
the high-capacity RNA-cDNA kit (Invitrogen #437;7474). Realtime assays were performed with real-time human FGFR2 (F:
GATAAATACTTCCAATGCAGAAGTGCT R: TGCCCTATATAATTGGAGACCTTACA) or mouse GAPDH (F: CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTA R: CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT) primers
using the Sybr Green Kit (Invitrogen #4364344) using 80 ng
cDNA per manufacturer's instruction. Triplicates were evaluated for each sample. The DDCT method was used to quantify
relative mRNA quantities. Data are displayed in fold changes as
compared with internal control mouse GAPDH.
Western blotting and antibodies
Tumor tissues were mechanically homogenized in RIPA
buffer with EDTA (Boston BioProducts) with a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Twenty-ﬁve
micrograms of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE
(Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF; Millipore). Immunoblots were probed for various
proteins, including FGFR2 (C8, Santa Cruz #6930), total-FRS2a
(Abcam #10425), phospho-FRS2a (Cell Sig. #3861), total-Erk1/2
(Cell Sig. #4695), phospho-Erk1/2 (Cell Sig. #4370), total-Akt
(Cell Sig. #9272), phosphor-Akt (Cell Sig. #4060), and b-actin
(Cell Sig. #4967).
IHC and antibodies
Mouse lungs were inﬂated and ﬁxed with 10% buffered
formalin overnight and embedded in parafﬁn (FFPE).
Unstained sections were stained with the following
antibodies: TTF-1 (Epitomics, #58803-1), SFTPC (Chemicon,
#AB378), CC-10 (Santa Cruz, #sc-9772), FGFR2 (Atlas Antibodies #HPA035305), phospho-FRS2a (Abcam #78195), and
phospho-Akt/Erk1/2 (see above). Staining kits for Ki67
(Vector #VP-K451) and TUNEL (Millipore #S7100) were
performed per manufacturer's instructions. Three representative images were quantiﬁed per mouse and averaged with
a minimum sample size of 6 animals per cohort (treated vs.
untreated).
Statistical analysis
P values for all survival curves were assessed by log-rank test,
whereas all other P values were assessed by the Student t test
(GraphPad Prism).

Results
Next-generation sequencing of patient samples has been
increasingly performed to uncover their oncogenic drivers and

were established to be transforming and oncogenic in vitro and
in vivo (22).
We generated inducible models of human FGFR2-IIIb mutations found in the extracellular (W290C) or kinase domains
(K660N; Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients with previously
reported FGFR2 mutations were largely devoid of intact p53
activity (>85%; ref. 9); therefore, the FGFR2 GEMMs were
crossed with the Trp53ﬂ/ﬂ model to obtain a bi-allelic mouse
(Fig. 1B). The gain or loss of function of FGFR2 or p53,
respectively, was conditional via cre-lox technology. At 6 weeks
of age, bi-allelic mice were induced via intranasal delivery of
adenovirus-cre (5  107 pfu), activating mutant FGFR2 activity
while inactivating p53. Induced animals revealed a lung tumor
latency of 28 to 32 weeks after adenovirus-cre administration
(Fig. 1B). Sick animals presented with progressive dyspnea and
weight loss. As expected, bi-allelic FGFR2K660N;p53/ tumor–

determine whether or not targeted therapy would be potentially more beneﬁcial over cytotoxic therapy. We interrogated
three publically available NSCLC datasets for mutation in
FGFR2 (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 8, 9, 27). Mutations in
FGFR2 are spread across the gene, primarily focused in the
extracellular or kinase domains, in NSCLC (Fig. 1A). Mutations
in these domains have been previously shown to lead to
constitutive receptor dimerization or kinase activity, respectively, driving oncogenic intracellular signaling (22).
Patients with FGFR2 mutations ranged in age from 42 to 81
years, averaging 66 years of age upon diagnosis. The combined
data also suggested the 2:1 ratio of tumor histology (squamous
cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma) with no predilection for
light to nonsmokers. Because of an overwhelming need for
mouse models of novel oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, we set
out to evaluate newly characterized FGFR2 mutations that

bearing animals displayed a signiﬁcant decrease in overall
survival as compared with uninduced littermate controls (Fig.
1C). Resulting tumors resembled poorly differentiated human
grade 3/4 lung adenocarcinoma displaying high pleiotropy and
heavily multinucleated tumor cells exhibiting strong characteristics of local invasion throughout the lung parenchyma
(Fig. 1D). Indeed, these tumors expressed robust levels of the
adenocarcinoma marker, thyroid transcription factor 1
(TTF-1; Fig. 1E). To further characterize the model, tumors
were stained with surfactant protein C (SFTPC; Fig. 1E),
suggesting a type II pneumocyte differentiation, similarly
observed in another mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma
driven by FGF9 (20). These tumors stained negative for the
clara cell antigen (CC10) marker at both early and late time
points (20 and 32 weeks postinduction), whereas the clara
cells of the alveolar epithelium stained positive (Supplementary Fig. S2). FGFR2-mutant models displayed similar phenotypes, but the penetrance for the extracellular domain was
less than the kinase domain (KD), 35% versus 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the extracellular domain (W290C) mod-

el's tumor latency was substantially longer than that of the
K660N (KD) animals. Thus, we chose to move forward with
the kinase domain mutant for treatment studies because of
its increased oncogenic activity (22) and recurrent mutation
in patient samples (Supplementary Table S1). Loss of p53
activity yielded increased penetrance (40% vs. 92% for p53 wt
and null, respectively) and decreased tumor latency (Supplementary Table S2).
Mutant mice developed distinct macroscopic nodules (Supplementary Fig. S3) that provided for isolation from normal
adjacent lung to molecularly characterize them at both the
RNA and the protein levels. Human FGFR2 mRNA in tumor
nodules was 15- to 20-fold higher than what was found in
normal uninduced lung (Fig. 2A). In general, FGFRs signal
through a key intracellular binding partner, FGFR substrate 2
alpha (FRS2a) that leads to MAPK and PI3K/Akt activity (28).
As a result of FGFR2 overexpression in our GEMM, elevated
phosphorylation events in FRS2a demonstrated that the receptors increased tyrosine kinase activity, leading to increased
levels of phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2 (Fig. 2B).

therapy when surgery and radiotherapy were otherwise ineffective (29). With the boom of targeted therapy driving patient
substratiﬁcation, we wanted to evaluate the effect of a panFGFR inhibitor in our FGFR2-driven lung cancer model. In a
tumor efﬁcacy study, we treated FGFR2K660N;p53/ lung
tumor–bearing animals with BGJ-398 (n ¼ 10), a pan-FGFR
inhibitor, or vehicle (n ¼ 5). Tumors were conﬁrmed via MRI
and served as baseline tumor volume. After 1 week of treatment
with daily, orally delivered 15 mg/kg BGJ-398, 8 of 10 animals
displayed greater than 50% tumor regression and 3 of 10
animals had regressed 80% (Fig. 3A and B). This phenomenon
is very similar to the efﬁcacy of erlotinib in our mutant EGFRdriven lung cancer mouse model (30). Efﬁcacy of BGJ-398
continued to signiﬁcantly improve at 2 and 4 weeks as

Next, we validated our immunoblot results via IHC for the
same downstream signaling mediators resulting from
increased FGFR2 activity (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig.
S4). Tumor nodules from both mutant FGFR2 models displayed robust speciﬁc cell surface staining of FGFR2. A tumor
driven by mutant Kras activity showed no staining (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Expected phosphorylation of various downstream signaling molecules, including AKT, ERK1/2, and
FRS2a, was present in tumor nodules from both the kinase
domain mutant (Fig. 2C) and the extracellular domain mutant
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Both models were deemed proliferative and actively growing as a result of positive Ki67 IHC.
Until relatively recently, the standard of care for patients
with advanced NSCLC has been limited to cytotoxic chemo-

FGFR2 Kinase Domain Activation Drives Lung Adenocarcinoma

(Fig. 4A) with obvious phosphorylation depletion in key
signaling proteins FRS2a, AKT, and ERK1/2. As a result of
short term dosing, BGJ-398–treated tumors displayed signs
of decreased proliferation (Ki67) and increased apoptosis
(TUNEL) via IHC (Fig. 4B). Moreover, there was a signiﬁcant
overall survival beneﬁt of animals undergoing BGJ-398 treatment (n ¼ 12) compared with an untreated, induced group
(n ¼ 30; Fig. 4C). Animals died on treatment due to issues
unrelated to lung tumor or drug toxicity, most commonly
due to improper oral dosing (n ¼ 2) or a secondary tumor
arising in the nasal airway epithelia that commonly metastasized to the brain (Supplementary Fig. S6). Unlike the
tumors originating in the lungs, these FGFR2-positive nasal
tumors were negative for the type II pneumocyte marker
SFTPC (Supplementary Fig. S6). After review, a veterinary

compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 3C), where animals showed near remission with 8 of 10 animals showing
greater than 75% tumor regression (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Long-term sustained tumor remission is being evaluated with
no acquired resistance seen at 6 months (n ¼ 4; data not
shown).
Next, we investigated the changes in downstream signaling pathways as a result of BGJ-398 treatment. Lung tumor–
bearing mice were treated for 2 days with either vehicle or
BGJ-398 (15 mg/kg) and sacriﬁced 2 hours after the second
dose to evaluate the drug's pharmacodynamics. Isolated
tumor nodules from both vehicle and drug treatment arms
were evaluated for phosphorylated FRS2a, AKT, and ERK
proteins (31). Overall, inhibition of FGFR2-dependent tyrosine kinase activity reduced MAPK and PI3K signaling

pathologist termed these esthesioneuroblastomas (n ¼ 2,
Supplementary Fig. S6), arising from the neuroepithelium.
These tumors developed well beyond the normal lung tumor
latency (>50 weeks), likely as a direct result of nasally
delivered adenovirus cre and resulted in lethality due to
obstruction of the nasal cavity, affecting the animal's normal
respiration. BGJ-398 caused a signiﬁcant decrease in proliferation (Fig. 4D) and a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis of
the lung tumor cells (Fig. 4E) after a short-term (2-day)
treatment, resulting in near-complete tumor regression at 4
weeks.

Discussion
FGF ligands and their cognate receptors have become
signiﬁcant clinical targets of interest in the oncology ﬁeld.
Recently, a group reported an inducible mouse model driving
FGF9 expression in the adult airway epithelia leading to the
formation of papillary adenomas, which were shown to progress into primary adenocarcinomas with a metastatic potential
(20). The FGF9 expression signaled through the FGFR3 receptor, and once the tumors were established, they were shown to
be FGF9-independent. Furthermore, while widespread expression of FGF3 and FGF7 in the adult mouse lung was shown to
produce type II cell hyperplasia (18, 19), FGF9 or FGF10
expression led to the development of cancer or adenomas,
respectively (17, 20). Interestingly, the FGF7 subfamily of
ligands (FGF3, 7, 10) is known to preferentially bind FGFR2
receptors, whereas FGF9 has been shown to signal through
FGFR3 (21), suggesting both receptors are important in lung
tumor development.
Activating mutations in FGFR2 have recently been unveiled
as novel targets in NSCLC, both in lung squamous cell and in
adenocarcinoma (8, 9). Inherent in their clinical relevance,
models driven by FGFR2-activating mutations have the potential to help researchers explore the biology of the RTK and to
evaluate novel targeted therapies for patients that fall into this
genetically deﬁned subset of cancers. A multitude of FGFR2
mutations have been identiﬁed in NSCLC, although it has been
unclear as to which are, in fact, oncogenic drivers up until
recently (22). In addition, with the recent success of targeted
therapies in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, it would be
advantageous to develop novel models of FGFR-driven lung
squamous cell carcinoma given the prevalence of FGFR alterations in this disease.
Described herein, we have developed the ﬁrst FGFR2-driven
GEMM of NSCLC. We developed conditional bi-allelic mice
that upon exposure to nasally delivered adenovirus-cre led to
activated FGFR2 signaling while also abrogating p53 function
concurrently. Both mutant models that were developed yielded
primary grade 3/4 lung adenocarcinoma that led to a significant decrease in overall survival as compared with uninduced
control littermates. While p53 loss of function was not required
for tumor formation (Supplementary Table S2), it was necessary to provide reasonable tumor latency for long-term efﬁcacy
studies to be completed. Combining loss of p53 with constitutive FGFR2 signaling led to a marked reduction in tumor
latency, also observed in a KRAS-driven mouse model of lung

4682

cancer (32). Furthermore, combining loss of p53 in our model is
clinically relevant given the high frequency of p53 loss in lung
cancers (8, 9).
Unlike the FGF9 model where the oncogene is broadly
expressed in all cells expressing SFTPC throughout the lung,
our system targets a smaller number of epithelial cells of
diverse lineages via expression of Cre recombinase by nasal
inhalation of adenovirus. This difference in technique may
explain the shorter latency in previously described models
(17, 20). Differences in latency are possibly also due to overexpression of FGF ligands in previous models versus expression of the mutant receptor in this model. Ligands can have
non–cell-autonomous effects on the other cells in the tumor
microenvironment such as endothelial cells (33) or cancerassociated ﬁbroblasts (34, 35), likely supporting the growth of
these tumors. In contrast to the previously described FGF9
model, early or late lesions in our FGFR2 model lack CC-10
staining, potentially indicating a non-clara cell origin, although
additional work is required to discover the cell of origin in these
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2).
This FGFR2-driven GEMM of NSCLC was created to study
the development and clinical aspects of lung cancer; however,
previously established mouse models overexpressing different
FGFs in the lung show similar but also distinct phenotypes to
the current model. The proliferative phenotypes in the FGF7
subfamily models are dependent on sustained FGF signaling
(17–19), whereas the FGF9 model develops ligand independence upon tumor formation via FGFR3 signaling (20).
As expected, lung tumors driven via constitutive FGFR2
signaling displayed increased AKT and ERK activity correlating
with FRS2a phosphorylation. As the extracellular domain
model had longer tumor latency, we chose to test BGJ-398,
a pan-FGFR inhibitor, in our kinase mutant model. This model
displayed exquisite sensitivity to BGJ-398 just after 1 week of
dosing. By 4 weeks after dose commencement, a large majority
of tumor-bearing animals had undergone nearly full tumor
remission leading to signiﬁcantly longer overall survival than
in untreated lung tumor–bearing animals. This sustained
response was durable and strikingly resembled our study of
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mutant EGFR-driven mouse
lung cancers (30). There was a small group of BGJ-treated
animals that died of improper oral dosing or tumors arising in
the nasal epithelia. The animals showing near-complete lung
tumor remission developed SFTPC-negative nasal tumors that
protruded into the brain while also impeding upon the animal's
breathing capacity. The lack of type II alveolar marker staining
(SFTPC) in these tumors conﬁrms that they are not a result of
lung metastasis. We have adapted an intratracheal delivery
method to circumvent this issue in the future. While we cannot
unequivocally suggest why the BGJ-398 had no therapeutic
effect on these tumors, a proper drug pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic study would be beneﬁcial to assess the
drug's capability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier.
Although the mutations in FGFR2 were identiﬁed in a
squamous cell carcinoma patient population, elevated
FGFR2-related activity is seen across both the major subtypes
of NSCLC. While we set out to develop a mouse model that
recapitulates human FGFR2-driven NSCLC, we were not

FGFR2 Kinase Domain Activation Drives Lung Adenocarcinoma

surprised by the adenocarcinoma phenotype as the preclinical
space is largely devoid of a lung squamous cell carcinoma
mouse model for many potential reasons. First, when inducing
oncogene expression in the mouse lung, targeting is largely
directed to type II pneumocytes (alveolar type II cells), which
have a predilection to lead to bronchioalveolar adenomas
leading to lung adenocarcinoma (36). Furthermore, the na€ve
mouse lung epithelium has no squamous cell differentiation
until an inﬂammatory event occurs driving metaplasia, which
is often initiated in patients with squamous cell carcinoma by
smoking (37). Recently, a group has shown the necessity for
chronic inﬂammation to drive spontaneous squamous cell
carcinoma formation within the mouse lung. They reported
that inactivation of IKKa (kinase-dead IKKa knock-in) drives
the upregulation of squamous cell carcinoma–associated markers including p63, Trim29, and keratin 5, leading to downregulation of LKB1 (STK11) activity (38). Second, there are
likely several features of the microenvironment that play a
role in squamous cell differentiation, which would be difﬁcult
to recapitulate without an initial inﬂammatory insult in the
transgenic environment. Third, there is also a strong possibility that those patients with FGFR2 mutations may require
another collaborating oncogene to drive the differentiation
into the squamous cell histology or perhaps the loss of another
tumor suppressor.
In summary, we have developed a mouse model of lung
adenocarcinoma driven by FGFR2 constitutive kinase activation originally identiﬁed in patients with NSCLC. With the
exquisite sensitivity of the lung tumor model to a pan-FGFR
inhibitor, researchers gain a powerful tool to further bolster
their understanding of FGFR-related cancer biology and targeted therapy discovery within the lung and across various
cancer indications. In addition, with the inevitability of
acquired resistance, this model could be of signiﬁcant value
for evaluation of response to targeted therapies, chemotherapy
as well as novel immunotherapies in an immunocompetent
environment. Together, these data validate a role for FGFR2 in

lung adenocarcinoma providing a model to further make an
impact in the decisions made by an oncologist treating this
genetically deﬁned population in the clinic.
