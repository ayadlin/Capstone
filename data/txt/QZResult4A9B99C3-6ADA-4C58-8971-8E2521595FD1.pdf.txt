ABSTRACT
Recent preclinical studies revealed the efficacy of combined use of PI3K inhibitor
BKM120 and PARP inhibitor Olaparib in breast and prostate cancers. The current
study investigated the effect of such drug combination on ovarian cancer. Here
we showed that combined inhibition of PI3K and PARP effectively synergized to
inhibit proliferation, survival and invasion in the majority of ovarian cancer cell lines
harboring PIK3CA mutations, including SKOV3, HEYA8, and IGROV1. Mechanistically,
combined treatment of PARP and PI3K inhibitors resulted in an exacerbated DNA
damage response and more substantially reduced AKT/mTOR signaling when
compared to single-agent. Notably, ovarian cancer cells responsive to the PI3K/
PARP combination displayed decreased BRCA1/2 expression upon drug treatment.
Furthermore, the effect of the drug combination was corroborated in an intraperitoneal
dissemination xenograft mouse model in which SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells responded
with significantly decreased BRCA1 expression, suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling and
reduced tumor burden. Collectively, our data suggested that combined inhibition of
PI3K and PARP may be an effective therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancers with
PIK3CA mutations and that the accompanied BRCA downregulation following PI3K
inhibition could serve as a biomarker for the effective response to PARP inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

significant fraction of this cancer type [3, 4], justifying
further investigation of the PI3K signaling pathway as a
major therapeutic target for this challenging disease [5].
A number of PI3K inhibitors have shown significant antitumor activities either as single-agents or when used in
combination with cytotoxic anti-cancer agents in in vitro
and in vivo models of ovarian cancers [5, 6]. BKM120, a
pan-class I PI3K inhibitor currently in Phase I/II clinical
trials [8, 9], has demonstrated anti-proliferative, proapoptotic, and antitumor activity in a variety of cell lines
and xenograft models from cancers with and without
aberrant PI3K pathway activation [10, 11]. In addition,
PI3K suppression has been shown to impair homologous
recombination (HR) in the cellular DNA damage response
pathway [12, 13].

The PI3K pathway is an important signaling
network that regulates critical cellular functions including
cell growth, proliferation and survival [1, 2]. Somatic
mutations in the PIK3CA gene are frequently found in a
variety of human cancers. PIK3CA mutations mainly occur
in the kinase domain (H1047R) and the helical domain
(E542K or E545K) of p110α, with H1047R being the most
common mutation [1]. These tumor-associated PIK3CA
mutations result in constitutive activation of p110α and
its downstream effector AKT signaling with consequent
oncogenic transformation [2]. Recent comprehensive
genomic characterization of ovarian cancers revealed that
aberrant PI3K pathway activation frequently occurs in a

The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
inhibitor Olaparib has been recently approved by FDA as
the first monotherapy to treat BRCA-mutated advanced
ovarian cancer [14]. PARP is involved in surveillance
and maintenance of genome integrity and functions as a
key molecule in the repair of DNA single-stranded breaks
(SSBs) [15]. BRCA proteins are critical for homologous
recombination (HR) repair of double-stranded DNA
breaks (DSBs) [16]. The function of BRCA1 in HRmediated repair contributes to its tumor suppressor activity
[16]. BRCA-deficient cells appear to be highly sensitive
to PARP inhibition, resulting in increased genomic
instability and apoptosis [16–18]. The combination of a
PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with PARP inhibitor Olaparib
has reported to exhibit synergistic therapeutic effects
for the treatment of a genetic mouse model of BRCA1related breast cancers as well as for the treatment of
BRCA1-proficient triple negative breast cancers [17].
More recently, combined inhibition of PARP and PI3K
was reported to confer increased efficacy in hormoneinsensitive advanced prostate cancer with PTEN and
p53 co-deficiency [19]. Results from these studies have
prompted an urgent need for the clinical investigation of
the combined use of PI3K inhibitor and PARP inhibitor.
Indeed, Phase I clinical trials of such drug combination
are currently enrolling patients with triple-negative breast
cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancers [20]. In the
current study, we set out to investigate the inhibitory effect
of combination treatment on PIK3CA mutated ovarian
cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms that account
for the therapeutic effect in in vitro and in vivo. To further
support the potential for the clinical translation of this
work, we investigated the potential use of BRCA gene
expression following PI3K inhibition as a biomarker for
treatment response to PARP inhibition.

assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) revealed that
the IC50s of SKOV3, IGROV1 and HEYA8 for BKM120
were pronouncedly lower (0.7256 μM, 0.5644 μM, and
0.9510 μM, respectively) than that of EFO27 (more than
2.138 μM) (Figure 1A). We next assessed target inhibition
by BKM120 treatment in these cancer cell lines. As
expected, BKM120 markedly reduced the abundance of
phosphorylated AKT protein (pAKT), a major effector of
PI3K activation, in a time-dependent manner (Figure S2A).
Accordingly, S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP) phosphorylation
was also downregulated, indicating attenuated mTOR
signaling (Figure S2A). Thus, consistent with its inhibitory
effect on cell proliferation, the PI3K inhibitor BKM120
treatment resulted in attenuated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
in PIK3CA mutant ovarian cancer cells.
PI3K inhibition by BKM120 has been previously
shown to incur DNA damage in breast cancer [17, 23],
prostate cancer [19] and glioblastoma cells [24]. We next
examined its effect on ovarian cancer cells. BKM120
treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of
histone 2AX on serine 139 (γH2AX), an indicator for
double-stranded DNA breaks, in a time-dependent manner
(Figure S2B). This increase also paralleled a decrease in the
abundance of the homologous recombination repair protein
RAD51 (Figure S2B) and phosphorylated AKT (Figure S2A).
Similarly, PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 as single-agent also led
to an increase in γH2AX and a decrease in the abundance of
RAD51 in ovarian cancer cell lines examined (Figure S3).
Together, these results suggested an association between
PI3K inhibition and enhanced DNA damage response in
ovarian cancer cells.

RESULTS

Previous studies have indicated that cells deficient in
homologous recombination (HR) repair are more susceptible
to PARP inhibition [25, 26]. Given that BKM120 rendered
PIK3CA mutated ovarian cancer cells more deficient in
HR repair (Figure S2B), we hypothesized that combined
inhibition of PI3K and PARP may lead to a stronger
therapeutic effect than BKM120 as singe-agent. To test
this hypothesis, we treated ovarian cancer cell lines with
increasing concentrations of BKM120 and Olaparib, each
alone and in combination for 72 hours. The effect of drug
combination on proliferation inhibition was evaluated by
CCK-8 assay followed by median-effect analysis [27].
Combined treatment with BKM120 and Olaparib resulted
in a synergistic increase in proliferation inhibition at
0.5 fractions affected (FA) and synergistic combination index
(CI) values of less than 1 over the majority of concentrations
tested in SKOV3, IGROV1 and HEYA8 cells (Figure 1B).
While concomitant treatment of EFO27 cells with BKM120
and Olaparib yielded CI values less than 1 over some but
not all concentrations tested, the drug combination did not

Combined use of BKM120 and Olaparib
synergistically inhibited the growth of PIK3CA
mutant ovarian cancer cells

The PI3K inhibitor BKM120 effectively blocked
the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells with
enhanced DNA damage response
BKM120 is a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor under active
clinical development [21]. To determine the response
of ovarian cancer cells to PI3K inhibition, we cultured
a panel of 11 ovarian cancer cell lines in the presence of
1 μM BKM120 for up to 10 days. While BKM120
effectively inhibited the growth of majority of the ovarian
cancer cell lines examined, we failed to identify an
apparent association between a particular genetic alteration
(i.e. PIK3CA, K-Ras, p53, PTEN, and EGFR) [22] and
cellular response to BKM120 treatment (Figure S1A and
S1B). To evaluate the efficacy of PI3K inhibitor BKM120
in ovarian cancer cells, we chose four PIK3CA mutant
ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, IGROV1, HEYA8,
and EFO27) for further examination. Cell proliferation

lead to any significant increase in the FA (Figure 1B). Thus,
unlike the other three ovarian cancer cell lines examined,
EFO27 cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects
exerted by combined use of BKM120 and Olaparib.
We also determined the long-term effect of drug
combination on ovarian cancer cells. PI3K inhibitor
BKM120 as single-agent markedly reduced the proliferation
of SKOV3, HEYA8 and IGROV1 cells (Figure 1C). In
contrast, PARP inhibitor Olaparib exhibited only moderate
inhibitory effect on the growth of SKOV3 and IGROV1
cells, but it had no impact on HEYA8 or EFO27 cells
(Figure 1C). Furthermore, combined use of BKM120 and
Olaparib nearly completely abrogated the growth of SKOV3
and IGROV1 cells, and to a lesser extent, in HEYA8 cells
(Figure 1C). Similarly, PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 as single-

agent or in combination with Olaparib also yielded growth
inhibitory effects on ovarian cancer cell lines examined,
except for EFO27 cells (Figure S4). Together, these results
indicated the therapeutic value of the combined PI3K and
PARP inhibition on PIK3CA mutant ovarian cancer cells.

BKM120 synergized with Olaparib to induce
apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells harboring
PIK3CA mutation
We next determined whether combined treatment
with BKM120 and Olaparib would have an impact on
apoptotic cell death [28]. While inhibition of PI3K or
PARP alone yielded a moderate increase in apoptotic cell
population (Annexin V-positive), combined treatment

resulted in substantially increased apoptosis in SKOV3,
IGROV1, and HEYA8 cells (Figure 2A). Consistent with
this observation, combination treatment also effectively
enhanced the abundance of cleaved PARP, a marker for
active apoptosis, in SKOV3, IGROV1, and HEYA8 cells
(Figure 2B). However, similar results were not found in
EFO27 cells (Figure 2A and 2B).
Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture condition
closely mimics an in vivo environment and can be used
to examine how cancer cells respond to drug treatment
[29]. The observation that combined use of BKM120
and Olaparib enhanced apoptosis in 2D culture condition
prompted us to further determine the effect of drug
combination on cell death in 3D assay condition. Inhibition
of PI3K or PARP alone did not induce dramatic cell death,
but combined treatment caused significant structural

disintegration and cell death in SKOV3 and IGROV1
cells, and to a lesser extent in HEYA8 cells (Figure 2C).
In contrast, the overall integrity of EFO27 cells was not
significantly affected by combined treatment (Figure 2C).
Together, these results suggested that combined use of
BKM120 and Olaparib may have a therapeutic value in
the treatment of ovarian cancer cells.

BKM120 synergized with Olaparib to inhibit
migration and invasion of PIK3CA mutant
ovarian cancer cells
Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical
initiation steps in the process of ovarian cancer metastasis
[30]. To examine the effect of combination treatment with
BKM120 and Olaparib on cellular migration, we performed

wound-healing assay with confluent monolayers of ovarian
cancer cells. While BKM120 as single-agent led to partially
filled gap, dual treatment with BKM120 and Olaparib
resulted in significantly attenuated migration of SKOV3 cells
(Figure 3A). BKM120 as single-agent or in combination
with Olaparib displayed a similar inhibitory effect on
migration of HEYA8 and IGROV1 cells (Figure 3A).
Notably, Olaparib as single-agent had little effect on
migration of all ovarian cancer cell lines tested. We also
noted that EFO27 cells did not show migration in the assay
conditions (Figure 3A).
We next used transwell assay to further examine
the drug effect on migration. In line with the observation
by wound-healing assay, combined use of BKM120 and
Olaparib significantly inhibited the migration of SKOV3,

HEYA8 and IGROV1 cells when compared to single
agent-treated or vehicle-treated cells (Figure 3B). Dual
treatment with BKM120 and Olaparib also inhibited
the migration of EFO27 cells, but to a lesser degree
(Figure 3B).
To determine the effect of drug combination on
invasion of ovarian cancer cells, we used Matrigel
invasion assay. While BKM120 as single-agent only
moderately inhibited cell invasion, combined use of
BKM120 and Olaparib significantly blocked the invasion
of all four ovarian cancer cell lines examined (Figure 3C).
Together, dual treatment of BKM120 and Olaparib
resulted in strong inhibitory effect on migration and
invasion potential of ovarian cancer cells.

cancer cells. (A) Cell migration potential was determined using a wound-healing assay. Images of the wound areas were shown at 0 and

Combined use of BKM120 and Olaparib
synergistically resulted in DNA damage of
PIK3CA-mutant ovarian cancer cells

we found that when treated with BKM120 alone or in
combination with Olaparib, SKOV3 and HEYA8 cells
exhibited marked downregulation of BRCA1/2 expression
with a concomitant increase in pERK (Figure 5A and 5B).
Interestingly, while the level of ERK phosphorylation
in IGROV1 cells was not affected by BKM120 or in
combination with Olaparib (Figure 5A), the expression
of BRCA1/2 is dramatically downregulated (Figure 5B),
suggesting BRCA1/2 expression can also be modulated
through an ERK-independent mechanism. Of note, the
three responsive ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, HEYA8
and IGROV1) exhibited markedly decreased BRCA1/2
expression at both mRNA and protein levels upon BKM120
or BKM120/ Olaparib treatment (Figure 5B and 5C).
Conversely, the insensitive EFO27 cells showed increased
BRCA1/2 expression upon drug treatment (Figure 5B).
Taken together, these results indicate that BRCA1/2
expression may be used to predict the efficacy of drug
treatment in ovarian cancer cells.

As PI3K inhibitor BKM120 as single-agent led to
an increase in γH2AX with a paralleled decrease in the
abundance of homologous recombination protein RAD51
in ovarian cancer cells (Figure S2B), we next determined
if additional use of PARP inhibitor Olaparib would further
dampen cellular response to DNA damage. While BKM120
or Olaparib as single-agents moderately induced DNA
damage as measured by tail moment, dual treatment with
BKM120 and Olaparib resulted in substantially enhanced
DNA damage in SKOV3, HEYA8 and IGROV1 cells
(Figure 4A). Notably, EFO27 cells did not show DNA
damage response in the assay conditions (Figure 4A).
To further assess the DNA damage response to dual
inhibition of PI3K and PARP, we examined γH2AX foci
and RAD51 recruitment by immunofluorescence staining.
For SKOV3, HEYA8 and IGROV1 cells, combined use of
BKM120 and Olaparib led to significantly increased number
of γH2AX foci but remarkably reduced RAD51 recruitment
when compared to single-agent treated or vehicle treated
cells (Figure 4B and S5). While dual inhibition of PI3K
and PARP resulted in exacerbated DNA damage response
in these three cell lines, it has little effect on EFO27 cells
(Figure 4B).

Combination treatment using BKM120 and
Olaparib exhibited strong therapeutic effect
on an intraperitoneal dissemination xenograft
mouse model
To investigate the therapeutic effect of the
combination treatment in vivo, we used an intraperitoneal
dissemination xenograft mouse model of SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cells. To facilitate the live imaging of tumor cell
growth in vivo, we engineered SKOV3 cells to stably
express luciferase (Luc), named SKOV3-Luc and then
introduced these cells into immunodeficient NOD/SCID
mice via intraperitoneal injection. Fourteen days post
injection, bioluminescence imaging analysis was employed
to ensure the establishment of disseminated tumors in the
peritoneal cavity of mice injected with SKOV3-Luc cells
(Figure 6A, top panel, baseline). These mice were then
subjected to inhibitor treatment. When compared to the
vehicle treatment, Olaparib has little effect on the luciferase
signal (Figure 6A). In contrast, BKM120 as single-agent and
to a more substantial degree when used in combined with
Olaparib, led to attenuated luciferase signals. Apparently, the
combination treatment caused a significant tumor cell killing
effect in this mouse model. In line with these observations,
tumors isolated from mice with combination treatment
also exhibited large areas of necrotic or apoptotic cells
(Figure 6B), indicating an effective therapeutic strategy.
Consistently, we observed remarkably reduced proliferative
index by Ki67 staining as well as significantly enhanced
apoptotic cell death by cleaved caspase 3 staining (Figure 6B).
Of note, we found that the combined use of BKM120 and
Olaparib had little effect on mouse body weight (Figure S6)
or the growth of normal mouse ovarian epithelial cells
(Figure S7). Together, the combination treatment proposed
in this study may be specifically effective on the treatment of
ovarian cancer cells with little toxic effects on normal cells.

Ovarian cancer cells that responded to the
combination treatment displayed concomitantly
decreased BRCA1/2 expression
Our results revealed that combined use of Olaparib and
BKM120 resulted in strong inhibitory effect on proliferation,
migration and apoptosis with exacerbated DNA damage
in PIK3CA mutant ovarian cell lines including SKOV3,
IGROV1 and HEYA8 cells, but not EFO27 cells. We next
set out to understand molecular mechanisms underlying the
differential cellular responses to the combination treatment.
We found that when compared to single-agent BKM120
treatment, combined use of BKM120 and Olaparib further
reduced the abundance of phosphorylated AKT, S6RP and
4EBP1 proteins, downstream effectors of PI3K/ AKT/
mTOR signaling, in SKOV3, IGROV1 and HEYA8 cells
(Figure 5A), suggesting that combined inhibition of PI3K
and PARP could downregulate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway. In contrast, only a rather weak effect on the PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway was seen in EFO27 cells treated
with BKM120 and Olaparib.
While all four ovarian cancer cell lines examined in
this study carry PIK3CA mutations, they showed differential
responses to combination treatment with BKM120 and
Olaparib. Previous work by Ibrahim YH et al reported that
BRCA1/2 expression correlates with Olaparib sensitivity
and that PI3K inhibition reduced BRCA1/2 expression via
an ERK-dependent effect [23]. In line with this finding,

by in vitro assays, tumors with the combination treatment
revealed remarkably attenuated BRCA1 expression with
concomitantly increased pERK signals when compared to
vehicle or single-agent treated groups.

To assess inhibition of signaling pathways by
combined use of BKM120 and Olaparib, we set out to
analyze the xenograft tumors by immunohistochemical
analysis. Remarkably, signals of pAKT, pS6RP and p4EBP1
were markedly reduced in tumors treated with dual BKM120
and Olaparib (Figure 6C). Together, these results suggested
inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling at least in part
account for the strong inhibitory effect on the growth of
disseminated ovarian cancer cells by combined use of
BKM120 and Olaparib. Of note, consistent with our finding

DISCUSSION
The current study reported that combined inhibition
of PI3K and PARP effectively blocked proliferation,

mutated ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with previous
findings from preclinical studies of breast [17, 23] and
prostate cancers [19], we also found that suppression of the
PI3K signaling by BKM120 was accompanied by increased

abundance of the double-stranded break marker γ-H2AX
and decreased abundance of homologous recombination
(HR) repair protein RAD51 in well-established cell models
of PIK3CA mutant ovarian cancer. Our data revealed that

PI3K suppression by BKM120 may render these ovarian
cancer cells more deficient in HR repair and thus more
dependent on the single-stranded DNA repair mechanism
that relies on PARP.
It was shown previously that loss of PTEN, leads
not only to activation of the PI3K pathway, but also to
an accumulation of DNA DSBs and thus synthetic lethal
interaction with PARP inhibition [25, 31–33]. Interestingly,
the two PTEN-deficient ovarian cancer cell lines examined
in the current study exhibited sensitivity toward PARP
inhibitor Olaparib with differential responses. Indeed, in
addition to mutational loss of PTEN, IGROV1 cells also
bear mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ARID1A [22]. It is
worth noting that deficiency of each of these gene products
(PTEN, BRCA1, BRCA2 and ARID1A) has been previously
shown to render cancer cells responsive to PARP inhibition
[23, 25, 31, 34], and may in this case collectively contribute
to the superior sensitivity of IGROV1 cells to Olaparib
when used in combination with PI3K inhibitor [34]. In
contrast, while harboring mutational loss of PTEN [19, 25],
EFO27 cells do not respond to PARP inhibition by Olaparib
or PI3K inhibition by BKM120, either as single-agent or
in combination, suggesting additional genetic alterations in
this cell line may modulate their respective drug responses.
Phosphorylation of S6RP has been shown to confer
resistance to PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient breast
cancers through regulation of DNA damage response and the
HR repair process [35]. In the current study, we showed that
PI3K inhibitor BKM120 as single-agent or in combination
with Olaparib nearly completely abolished p-S6RP signals
in the in vitro cell models of ovarian cancer (SKOV3,
IGROV1, HEYA8) that respond well to drug treatment. In
line with this, similarly strong inhibition of p-S6RP signals
was observed in an intraperitoneal dissemination model
of SKOV3 ovarian cancers following the combination
treatment. However, it is worth noting while the combined
use of Olaparib and BKM120 did lead to markedly reduced
pS6RP signals, the remaining signals may still contribute to
the resistance of EFO27 cells to the combination treatment.
It has been recently shown that concomitant
BRCA1/2 downregulation following PI3K inhibition
in breast cancer and prostate cancer is sufficient for the
induction of HR deficiency, rendering cancer cells to
acquire sensitivity to PARP inhibition [19, 23]. In the
current study, we found that PI3K inhibition by BKM120
acts synergistically with PARP inhibition in abolishing the
growth and survival of PIK3CA mutated ovarian cancer cells
(SKOV3, HEYA8, and IGROV1) in in vitro assays as well
as in an in vivo model of SKOV3 cells. Interestingly, the
three examined ovarian cancer cell models that responded
well to combination therapy also exhibited concomitantly
diminished BRCA1/2 expression, which is consistent
with the previously established synthetic lethal interaction
between BRCA deficiency and PARP inhibition [23, 36].
Indeed, the degree of HR impairment induced by PI3K
blockade may vary among different ovarian cancer cells;
meanwhile, the sensitivity to dual PARP and PI3K inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

may be dependent on the degree of concomitant BRCA1/2
downregulation that allows further impairment of DNA
damage response/the HR repair process. Collectively, our
data suggested that the combination of PI3K and PARP
inhibitors represents a promising therapeutic approach
for the treatment of PIK3CA mutated ovarian cancers.
Concomitantly decreased BRCA1/2 expression might
predict effective response of ovarian cancer cells to the
combination treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
SKOV3, PA1, SW626, CAOV3, OVCAR8, and
OVCAR5 ovarian cancer cell lines were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection. The other lines
reported here were available in our laboratories. SKOV3,
PA1, SW626, CAOV3, OVCAR8, OVCA433, HEYA8
and OVCAR5 were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), EFO27, IGROV1 and
A2780 cells in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS.
Cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2-containing
atmosphere.

Cell proliferation assay
The effects of the given drugs on cell proliferation
were measured as previously described [26]. Briefly,
cells were trypsinized and seeded into six-well plates at
1000 cells/well density and then treated with indicated
concentration of BKM120, combination (BKM120 plus
Olaparib at the respective concentrations) or DMSO control.
Cell culture medium containing drug or vehicle control
was renewed every 3 days. The cells were incubated for
about 10 days until colonies were large enough to be clearly
discerned. Cells were fixed with cold methanol, stained with
crystal violet (Sigma–Aldrich) and subsequently extracted
with 10% glacial acetic acid. The optical density (OD) was
measured at 570 nm by EnSpire® Multimode Plate Readers
(PerkinElmer).

Growth inhibition assay and drug combination
analysis
The cell counting kit-8 assay (Dojindo Molecular
Technologies) was carried out according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and as previously described [37]. IC50s were
calculated from sigmoidal dose-response curves utilizing
Prism. The combination effect was determined by the
combination index (CI) method [27] using the Calcusyn
software program (Biosoft). Data from cell viability assays
were expressed as the fraction of growth inhibition by
the individual drugs or the combination in drug-treated
cells. Synergism was indicated by a CI values less than 1
and antagonism by a CI value more than 1 at 50% effect
(Fraction Affected = 0.5).

Immunoblotting and antibodies

through the Matrigel-coated inserts. After treatment, the
cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution. Cells
that remained in the gel or attached to the upper side of
the filter were removed with cotton swabs. Cells on the
underside of the filter were examined by light microscope
and counted using microscope at high-power.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described [35]. Cell
lysates were cleared by centrifugation and proteins were
resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Blots were probed with the
following antibodies: pAKT(Ser473), pERK1/2, cleavedPARP, pS6RP(Ser235/236), p4EBP1(Thr37/46) (Cell
Signaling Technology), AKT, S6RP, ERK1/2, 4EBP1
(Proteintech) and vinculin (Sigma). Second antibody: Goat
anti-Mouse IgG (HRP-conjugated, Thermo), Anti-rabbit IgG
(HRP-conjugated, Cell Signaling Technology).

Comet assay
Cells were treated and harvested 48 h after drugs
treatment, and  1.5 × 104 cells from each sample were
subjected to the neutral comet assay as described [39].
Following electrophoresis, the cells were stained with
ethidium bromide and viewed using a fluorescence
microscope (Leica DMI4000B). We analyzed 200 individual
cell images from each group using Comet Assay Software
Pect (CaspLab) software. Tail moment was defined and
served as a quantitative measure of DNA damage.

Apoptosis measurement
Apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells were analyzed
with Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Dojindo
Molecular Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cultured cells were trypsinized with
0.25% trypsin without EDTA, and stained with Annexin
V FITC and PI solution. Stained cells were then subjected
to flow cytometry analysis on a BD Accuri™ C6 (BD
Biosciences, NJ).

Immunofluorescence staining analysis of γH2AX
and RAD51
Ovarian cancer cells were cultured on coverslips
in 24-well plates for 48 hours in respective medium
containing inhibitor. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, and blocked with a 5% BSAphosphate buffer solution. The cells were then incubated
with rabbit anti-RAD51 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or rabbit anti- γH2AXSer139 polyclonal
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4°C.
After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with
secondary antibodies and DAPI at room temperature.
Images were acquired and quantified using an
immunofluorescence microscope (Leica). The dynamics
of γH2AX and RAD51 foci accumulation, as well as
percentage of positive cells (more than 5 foci in one cell)
were calculated based on analysis of about 200 cells.

3D sphere culture
3D cell culture experiments were performed as
previously described [38]. Briefly, ovarian cancer cells
were seeded on 96-well plates coated with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). Cells were grown in DMEM or RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 2% Matrigel and
allowed to grow for 4 days. Cells were then fed with media
supplemented with 2% FBS and 2% Matrigel and drugs
were also added at this time point. 3D structures were scored
according to 3D structure integrity based on the resemblance
to images shown in Figure 2C. Over 100 colonies were
scored for each condition.

Wound-healing, migration and invasion assay

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

Wound-healing assay was used to evaluate cell
migration as described previously [26]. Briefly, cells were
seeded in 24-well plates and grown until confluent state and
then cells were scratched using sterile tips. Then the cell
monolayer was rinsed twice with PBS to remove debris.
Fresh culture medium was added with indicated drugs. The
mean width of each scratch was measured using Image Pro
Plus (Media Cybernetics).
For the transwell migration assay, cells treated with
indicated drugs were seeded into the upper chambers
in FBS-free medium at a density of 5 × 104 cells per
chamber and 600 μl of 10% FBS containing medium was
placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant.
For the transwell invasion assay, 1 × 105 cells
per chamber were plated. Cells were allowed to invade

Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells
with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), according to
the manufacturers’ instructions. Reverse transcription
reactions were performed using PrimeScript™ RT reagent
Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara). To quantify the amount of
transcripts, SYBR Green based qPCR was performed with
PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (Takara) using Real Time
PCR System (Stratagene Mx3000p). The primers for human
BRCA1 were 5′-GTCCCATCTGTCTGGAGTTGA-3′
(forward) and 5′-AAAGGACACTGTGAAGGCCC-3′
(reverse); BRCA2 5′-AAAGGACACTGTGAAGGCCC-3′
(forward) and 5′-TTCTTCCTCTCTTTCATTGCG-3′
(reverse). The specificity of amplicons was verified with
melting curve analysis and the messenger levels were
normalized using GAPDH, as an internal control.

Isolation and culture of ovarian epithelial cells
The mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells were
obtained from mature mice by mild trypsinization as
previously described [41]. Briefly, ovaries were removed
from four adult female FVB mice and rinsed with Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS). Ovaries were placed in a
15 ml conical culture tube containing 10 ml HBSS with
0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 30 minutes. The epithelial
cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml
complete medium (DMEM supplemented with 4% FBS, 1×
penicillin-streptomycin, 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium).
