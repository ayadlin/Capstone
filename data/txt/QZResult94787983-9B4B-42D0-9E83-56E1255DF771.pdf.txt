BACKGROUND: To evaluate tumor responses, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity of chemotherapy, children
with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and progressive low-grade glioma were enrolled into the Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
A9952 protocol and treated with carboplatin and vincristine (CV). METHODS: Non-NF1 patients were randomized to CV or thioguanine, procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, and vincristine in COG A9952. NF1 patients were assigned to CV only.
NF1 patients and non-NF1 patients who were treated with CV were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, toxicity, tumor
responses, EFS, and OS. RESULTS: A total of 127 eligible patients with NF1 were nonrandomly assigned to CV: 42 NF1 patients (33%)
had events, and 6 (4.7%) died. The 5-year EFS rate was 69% 6 4% for the CV-NF1 group and 39% 6 4% for the CV–non-NF1 group
(P <.001). In a univariate analysis, NF1 children had a significantly higher tumor response rate and superior EFS and OS in comparison
with CV-treated children without NF1. NF1 patients and non-NF1 patients differed significantly in amount of residual tumor, extent of
resection, tumor location, and pathology. According to a multivariate analysis, NF1 was independently associated with better EFS
(P <.001) but not with OS. NF1 patients also had a decreased risk of grade 3 or 4 toxicities in comparison with non-NF1 patients.
Three second malignant neoplasms occurred in NF1 patients receiving CV (CV-NF1 group) at a median of 7.8 years (range, 7.3-9.4
years) after enrollment, but there were none in the non-NF1 group. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 tolerated CV well and had tuC 2016 American Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Optic pathway gliomas occur in 15% to 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and usually are identified
within the first decade of life.1,2 Most have an indolent course and do not require therapy. However, a subset of children
with NF1 have low-grade gliomas (LGGs) in the optic chiasmal/hypothalamic region, posterior optic tract, optic nerve,
and other locations that progress, become symptomatic, and require initiation of therapy.3 NF1-associated optic pathway
gliomas are overwhelmingly pilocytic astrocytomas, and biopsy is unnecessary for intrinsic optic pathway tumors with the
characteristic appearance on magnetic resonance imaging.4 Because surgery has limited therapeutic value for tumors
intrinsic to the optic pathway and can produce further visual deficits, it is primarily limited to those patients who have preexisting loss of vision or bulky disease or have relapsed after initial treatment.5 Radiotherapy is usually withheld from children with NF1 because of concerns about vascular damage with subsequent strokes and second malignancies in this
group, which is already predisposed to both because of the genetic condition.4,6-9 Therefore, it has become common practice to treat progressive optic pathway and other LGGs in children with NF1 initially with chemotherapy. The most

common regimen has been carboplatin and vincristine
(CV) because of prior clinical trials that primarily used
this chemotherapy for children without NF1 who had
LGGs.10,11
A Children’s Oncology Group (COG) study (COG
A9952) enrolled all young children with progressive
hypothalamic/optic pathway gliomas or other eligible
progressive LGGs in a prospective, randomized fashion
for treatment with either CV or thioguanine, procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, and
vincristine (TPCV). Because of concerns about the mutagenic potential of TPCV, children with NF1 were
excluded from the randomization and were treated only
with CV. Results for children without NF1 who were
treated in COG A9952 have been previously reported.12
This report focuses on tumor responses/control and
treatment-related toxicities for children with NF1 who
were treated with this protocol and compares their results
with those for patients with non-NF1 tumors who were
treated similarly.12
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The eligibility criteria for this study were the same as those
previously reported for the randomized patients without
neurofibromatosis (NF1),12 They included the following:
age less than 10 years at study entry, residual LGG (World
Health Organization grade I or II13 in any area of the
brain except the pons and optic nerve without cranial
extension, and no previous treatment except surgery.
Other eligible diagnoses included pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, lowgrade ganglioglioma, low-grade oligodendroglioma, and
infantile desmoplastic astrocytoma. For NF1 patients,
objective progression, defined as at least a 25% increase in
tumor size estimated from the product of the maximal
bidimensional measurements, was required. Patients with
characteristic chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors intrinsic
to the optic pathway were eligible without pathological
confirmation. NF1 patients were all treated within the 6
weeks after imaging confirmed tumor progression.
All patients/guardians gave written informed consent according to institutional and National Cancer Institute guidelines, and the protocol was approved by the
institutional review boards at all participating centers.
Study Design

Patients without NF1 were randomly assigned to CV or
TPCV. Patients with NF1 were nonrandomly assigned
only to the same CV regimen used for the non-NF1

patients, as previously reported.12 The objective response
to chemotherapy was determined at the end of chemotherapy by the institution and by central review by the
study neuroradiologists (G.V. and T.N.B.), who also
reviewed the baseline magnetic resonance imaging for eligibility. The annual follow-up included notation by the
institution about subsequent treatments received after
CV. For the purpose of this report, these forms were
reviewed, and subsequent therapy for all patients with
events was collected.
Chemotherapy Adjustments for Toxicity

Children with NF1 followed the same dose-reduction
schedule used for those without NF1, as previously
reported.12
Evaluation of the Tumor Response

Tumor size was estimated from maximal bidimensional
measurements (ie, the area) via the product of the longest
diameter and its longest perpendicular diameter for solid
components of each lesion; cysts were excluded with the
same criteria described for the randomized non-NF
study.12 Because enhancement can vary with technique
and timing, the fluid attenuated inversion recovery and
T2-weighted images were primarily used by the central
reviewers to determine responses.14
Statistical Methods

The Pearson chi-square test was performed to test the
comparability of the baseline characteristics, possible
prognostic factors, and stratification factors upon enrollment between NF1 and non-NF1 participants who
received CV.
Cumulative probabilities of toxicity were estimated
with life table methods, with the time to an event defined
as the time from the start of therapy until the first occurrence of a grade 3 or 4 toxicity or a grade 4 only toxicity,
or if none of these events occurred, until the end of chemotherapy. A log-rank test was used to test the difference in
the cumulative probabilities of toxicity between NF1 and
non-NF1 patients.
The primary endpoints for the analysis of treatment
efficacy were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival
(OS). The time to an event was defined as the time from
enrollment to first disease progression, disease recurrence,
death from any cause, the occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm (SMN), or last contact if no events
occurred. OS was defined as the time to death from any
cause. Patients not experiencing an event or death were
censored at the date of last contact. Nonparametric EFS

and OS curves were computed with product-limit
(Kaplan-Meier) estimates. Point estimates of EFS and OS
were reported as estimates and standard errors. Cox
regression analysis was used to test the equality of survivor
functions between NF1 and non-NF1 patients, with a P
value < .05 considered statistically significant. Because of
the small number of observed deaths, a permutation test
was used to confirm the P value for the 5-year OS comparison. Patients were analyzed according to their original
assigned treatment without regard to deviations in treatment that might have occurred after enrollment according
to intent-to-treat methods.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to analyze possible prognostic factors. Univariate Cox regression was used to estimate the main effect of each variable.
Variables with P values less than .1 from univariate models were selected for inclusion in the multivariate model.
Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare the full model
and the model without individual variables to obtain the
P value for that variable. Variables with P values less than
.05 were included in the final model and were considered
to be significant prognostic factors.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

The COG A9952 study enrolled 264 eligible patients
who were assigned to CV (127 NF1 patients and 137
non-NF1 patients). Non-NF1 patients randomized to
TPCV were not included in this analysis. No NF1
patients were assigned to TPCV. Among those patients
assigned to CV, 8 NF1 patients and 9 non-NF1 patients
were deemed ineligible by central and chair review, as
shown in Figure 1. All other patients were analyzed
according to the assigned regimen. The characteristics of
eligible patients assigned to CV at the time of enrollment
are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to sex, race, or age
at diagnosis, but tumor characteristics, including the
amount of residual tumor, extent of resection, results of
institutional pathology review, and tumor site, differed
significantly between NF1 and non-NF1 patients
(P < .001).
Treatment Events

Forty-two of the 127 eligible NF1 patients experienced an
event as identified by their treating institution, and 6
died: 2 NF patients died of progressive/persistent disease,
1 died of infection, 1 died of hemorrhaging, and 2 died of
unreported causes. There were no deaths on treatment.
The 2 NF1 deaths due to tumors occurred in patients who
1930

had an extensive tumor in the hypothalamus-optic chiasm
with extension into either the frontal lobe or basal ganglion and thalamus. A total of 3 SMNs occurred in 3 NF1
patients at a median of 7.8 years (range, 7.3-9.4 years) after enrollment: anaplastic astrocytoma at a remote location from the primary, acute myeloid leukemia, and
undifferentiated sarcoma. Each diagnosis was observed in
1 patient. All 3 patients who developed SMNs had
received additional therapy after CV for either a recurrent
tumor (n 5 1) or carboplatin allergy (n 5 2), which
included temozolomide, before the development of their
SMNs. None of these patients received radiotherapy.
Twenty-seven of the 42 NF1 patients with events reported
1 to 3 subsequent chemotherapy regimens after CV (Table 2). As shown in Figure 1, the 2 patients who had allergies and changes in treatment had an SMN as their first
event, whereas the other patient had recurrence as the first
event. Patients who did not experience an EFS event were
followed for a median of 6.4 years.
Overall Outcome and Effect of the NF1 Status

NF1 patients had better EFS than non-NF1 patients. In
the univariate analysis, the 5-year EFS rate with the standard error was 69% 6 4% for NF1 patients and
39% 6 4% for non-NF patients (P < .001; Fig. 2). NF1
patients also had better OS. The 5-year OS rate was
98% 6 1% for NF1 patients and 87% 6 3% for nonNF1 patients (P 5 .003; permutation test P 5 .002).
Among patients with hypothalamic/optic chiasmal
tumors, the 5-year EFS rate was 68% 6 5% for NF1
patients and 38% 6 6% for non-NF1 patients
(P < .001), and the 5-year OS rate was 99% 6 1% for
NF1 patients and 86% 6 4% for non-NF1 patients
(P 5 .01).
A multivariate analysis was performed to see whether
the apparent difference in NF and non-NF outcomes was
due to other factors. Although age and the amount of residual tumor were found to be independent prognostic
factors, the NF1/non-NF1 difference in EFS nonetheless
remained significant (hazard ratio, 2.45; P < .001). However, the OS difference was no longer significant after we
controlled for significant prognostic factors (sex, age, residual, pathology, and tumor site; Table 3). Restricting
these multivariate analyses to patients with optic pathway/
hypothalamic tumors, who constituted the majority of the
NF1 patients, did not change these conclusions.
There was evidence that the influence of the amount
of residual tumor and age on EFS differed between NF1
and non-NF1 patients. The effect of the amount of residual tumor on EFS was larger for NF1 patients (P 5 .02,

DISCUSSION
The COG A9952 trial was initiated to validate the
approach of using chemotherapy for LGG to improve survival and delay radiotherapy in young children and to
compare the effectiveness and toxicity of the 2 regimens.12
NF1 patients were not randomized because of concerns
about an increased risk of second malignancies due to the
genetic background and alkylator therapy included in the
alternative TPCV regimen of this randomized study.15
The vast majority of children with NF1 entered the study
without biopsy.
When we compared the results of NF1 patients
and non-NF1 patients receiving CV, the data revealed
some notable differences (Table 1). However, the NF
status remained significant (P < 0.001) for EFS when
adjustments were made for significant prognostic

variables in the multivariate analysis. The NF1 children
also had a higher objective tumor response rate. The percentages of patients not evaluable for responses with
NF1 (35%) and without NF1 (32%) were a weakness,
but they were similar for the groups, and this allowed a
valid comparison in this study. In the multivariate analysis for OS, the NF status was not an independent prognostic variable. The size of the residual tumor had a
larger effect on EFS for NF1 patients than non-NF1
patients, whereas age had a larger effect on EFS for nonNF1 patients than NF1 patients.
For unclear reasons, hematological toxicity occurred
less frequently in NF1 subjects versus non-NF1 subjects;
other organ toxicities did not differ between the groups.
Ototoxicity was not evaluated in our study. Although ototoxicity is much less common with carboplatin than cisplatin, in a recent study, very young children treated for
retinoblastoma with a CV-containing regimen were found
1934

to have ototoxicity.16 Despite a lack of evidence showing
that carboplatin causes cognitive issues,17 children treated
for LGG with CV should be monitored over the long
term for both cognitive deficits and ototoxicity. Both may
affect the quality of life in children with NF1 and brain
tumors and especially in those with visual deficits.18
The eligibility criteria for our study included only
those NF1 patients who demonstrated a 25% or greater
increase in the size of the tumor. Patients were not enrolled on the basis of the initial finding of the tumor or an
optic pathway abnormality. This is different than other
reports in the literature.19-21 We were concerned about
overtreatment of children with NF1, as had been suggested by others.1,4 In a cooperative group study performed for a similar time period (the Hirntumorstudien
LGG study), 65 of 108 children with NF1 were treated at
the time of diagnosis. For EFS from the initial diagnosis,
it was found that NF1 was an unfavorable prognostic factor, probably because of the study’s methodology of designating a patient as having an event when he or she was
enrolled in chemotherapy at diagnosis.19
Even though the regimen was restricted to CV, the
majority of the second malignancies in the COG A9952
study occurred in the NF1 population, likely because of
their genetic risk and possible interactions with subsequent chemotherapy such as temozolomide. In the previously reported non-NF1 population treated with TPCV,
there were only 2 patients with SMNs, and 1 of these
patients also received temozolomide as a subsequent treatment.12 Although some studies suggest that radiation
therapy is associated with SMNs in NF1 patients, the concern about alkylator therapy is supported by 2 patients in
the literature with NF1 who experienced transformation
of pilocytic astrocytoma into anaplastic astrocytoma after

Low-Grade Glioma in NF1/Ater et al

On the positive side, this study demonstrated that
the NF1 children tolerated the CV chemotherapy well
and had a higher tumor response and control rate than the
non-NF1 children. There were no deaths or serious
adverse events from the chemotherapy during the treatment period. However, the tolerance of the chemotherapy
should not be used as a justification for using it in children
with NF1 when it is not necessary. Determining the indication for the initiation of therapy in NF1 children
remains controversial.4 Physicians should be aware that
the natural history of LGGs in children with NF1 is more
variable, with prolonged stable disease and even spontaneous regressions reported.23 Also, tumor enhancement can
fluctuate with the timing of imaging,14 so an increase in
enhancement may not be an adequate enough change to
warrant treatment. It is possible that spontaneous regression could have increased the response rate in the NF1
patients in our study.
Recent retrospective studies have suggested that despite responses to chemotherapy, children with NF1 do
not necessarily improve their vision with treatment.20,24,25 However, Fisher et al20 recently reported a
multicenter, retrospective analysis of visual outcomes for
children with NF1 treated with chemotherapy. In their
study, 88 subjects were evaluable for visual acuity outcomes. At the completion of chemotherapy, visual acuity
had improved or remained stable in 72% of the subjects.
A limitation of our study is that an ophthalmological evaluation was not mandated. Although such examinations
can be difficult in very young children, their inclusion in
future studies is required to evaluate the efficacy of
treatment.
There are relatively few other chemotherapy regimens that have been tested for LGG in children with
NF1. Bouffet et al26-28 studied weekly vinblastine for
recurrent/refractory LGG and reported some objective
responses in children with NF1. Packer et al29 reported
objective responses to bevacizumab and irinotecan in 10
children with multiple recurrent LGGs, including 3
patients with NF1.29 Targeted therapies have been investigated for LGG with mixed results. A phase 2 study of
sorafenib for progressive LGG showed unexpected acceleration of tumor growth in both NF1 and BRAF fusion
LGG, with the only response in a BRAF wild-type LGG;
this was likely related to paradoxical extracellular signalregulated kinase activation.30 More promising, a phase 1
trial of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor AZD6244 reported sustained responses in 8 of 38
patients with LGG.31

In summary, this large centrally reviewed study of
LGG treated with chemotherapy validates the idea that
CV given in a weekly regimen is efficacious at producing
chemotherapy responses and tumor control in children
with NF1. The development of SMNs, presumably
related to germline susceptibility, is more frequent among
NF1 patients than non-NF1 patients treated for these
tumors, and it appears to be associated with the use of
secondary regimens, particularly alkylators such as
temozolomide.
