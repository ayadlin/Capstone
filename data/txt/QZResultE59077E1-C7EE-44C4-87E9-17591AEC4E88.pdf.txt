ABSTRACT
The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib is now used as standard therapy for
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Predictive biomarkers of response to
sorafenib are thus necessary. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility
of using targeted DNA and RNA sequencing to elucidate candidate biomarkers of
sorafenib response using fine-needle biopsy, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) specimens in patients with HCC. Targeted DNA and RNA deep sequencing
were feasible for the evaluation of fine-needle biopsy FFPE specimens obtained from
46 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib. Frequent mutations of suppressor genes,
such as CTNNB1 (34.8%) and TP53 (26.1%), were detected in the HCC tumors.
After excluding these suppressor genes, the average numbers of detected oncogene
mutations differed significantly between the non-PD and PD groups (P = 0.0446). This
result suggests that the oncogene mutational burden in the tumor might be associated
with the clinical response to sorafenib. We have identified candidate gene expression
(TGFa, PECAM1, and NRG1) in tumor for the prediction of sorafenib response and PFS
by RNA sequencing. Our findings provide new insights into biomarkers for sorafenib
therapy and allow us to discuss future therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION

The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib is now used as
standard therapy for advanced HCC. In two pivotal clinical
studies, a response was observed in 3.3% (5/150) and 0.7%
(2/299) of patients treated with sorafenib [5, 6]. Despite
its low response rate, we occasionally encounter HCC
patients with good response to sorafenib, and their clinical
characteristics have been recently investigated in Japan
[7]. Complete responses were also observed in patients
with unresectable HCC after short-term treatment with

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common
malignancy worldwide, and the at-risk population is
still growing [1, 2]. Several reports have suggested
that hepatocarcinogenesis involves multiple molecular
pathways and the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
alterations, including copy number aberrations and gene
mutations [3, 4]

RESULTS

sorafenib [8-10]. In a retrospective study, we previously
analyzed the clinical and molecular backgrounds of 13
responders to sorafenib who experienced significant tumor
shrinkage [11]. A comparative genomic hybridization
analysis using one frozen HCC sample from a responder
demonstrated that the 11q13 region, a rare amplicon
in HCC including the loci for FGF3 and FGF4, was
highly amplified. A real-time polymerase chain reactionbased copy number assay revealed that FGF3/FGF4
amplification was observed in 3 of the 10 HCC samples
from responders with evaluable DNA samples. FGF3/
FGF4 amplification is thus considered to be a possible
mechanism involved in the response to sorafenib.
However, the mechanisms responsible for the response
to sorafenib in the remaining seven cases remain unclear.
Here, we conducted a prospective and retrospective study
to elucidate the other mechanisms related to sorafenib
response and to find out the predictive biomarkers for
sorafenib response.
Recent cancer profiling studies have focused on
next-generation sequencing (NGS). The development of
HCC is a multistep process that involves the accumulation
of a wide range of genetic and phenotypic alterations,
leading to the aberrant expression of genes that regulate
cell proliferation. Therefore, somatic mutations are often
detected in HCC [12, 13], and these mutations are part
of key mechanisms resulting in carcinogenesis. Somatic
mutations of cancer-related genes are also related to the
sensitivity and resistance of solid tumors to targeted drugs.
For example, the KRAS mutation status in colorectal
cancer is related to the effectiveness of anti-epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies [14].
The use of targeted DNA and RNA sequencing
using NGS technology has been limited to clinical
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. We
have focused on molecular profiling using FFPE samples
[15, 16]. However, few previous studies have compared
the mutation profiles of HCC biopsy samples and the
response to sorafenib treatment.
RNA sequencing of steady-state RNA expression
avoids the limitations of microarray expression and
allows for the massive parallel sequencing of millions
of sequences on chips containing complementary DNA
(cDNA) libraries, generating a higher number of transcript
sequences than is possible using a microarray analysis
[17]. Thus, RNA sequencing presents unprecedented
possibilities for genomic characterization. The expression
data for more than 20,000 genes is thought to have a
high redundancy, and a large sample size is necessary for
validation. Therefore, for this study, we used a multiple
gene expression analysis for FFPE samples using targeted
RNA sequencing as well as DNA sequencing. This gene
set was selected for targeted genes or genes related to drug
sensitivity.

Patients and sample collection
In this study, we assessed 46 specimens obtained
from HCC patients treated with sorafenib. The
characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1.
Twenty-four patients were non-PD group (PR + SD) and
18 patients were PD group to sorafenib, as determined
using the RECIST criteria. Response was not evaluable
(NE) in four patients. Most of the specimens (40/46,
87.0%) were obtained by liver biopsy. The 46 specimens
were subjected to DNA and RNA extraction, yielding
median amounts of 266.9 ng (range, 53.2 to 474.0) and
97.7 ng (range, 3.2 to 6555.6), respectively. The results of
the DNA and RNA extraction are shown in Supplementary
Table S1.

Analysis of somatic mutations
Somatic hotspot mutations in 50 genes were
screened using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel
v2. Mutation profiling was successfully performed in all
the cases. The average read number of all the samples was
472,016 (range, 101,044 to 1,139,936). The average read
number of amplicons was 2,280 (range, 22 to 30,083),
allowing the detection of mutations in samples containing
approximately 1% tumor cells.
A somatic mutation in at least one gene was
identified in 32 of the 46 specimens (69.9%). Six
specimens (13.0%) were positive for mutations in two
genes, one specimen had mutations in three genes, and
one specimen had mutations in five genes (Figure 1A).
We identified CTNNB1 mutations in 16 patients (34.8%),
TP53 mutations in 12 (26.1%), NRAS mutations in 5
(10.9%), PTPN11 mutations in 2 (4.3%), and APC,
CSF1R, ERBB2, FGFR2, FLT3, GNAQ, KRAS, PIK3CA,
and SMARCB1 mutations in 1 each (2.2%) (Figure 1B).
All the mutational statuses are shown in Supplementary
Table S2. This mutation profile for HCC tumors was
consistent with those of previous reports [12].
To explore differences between the non-PD and PD
groups, we compared the number of mutations. Among
the 46 patients, 24 were classified as non-PD group (PR
+ SD) and 18 were classified as PD group, according to
the RECIST criteria. The 4 NE patients were excluded
from the analysis. Among the 24 non-PD group, 14
specimens were positive for mutations in one gene and
three specimens had mutations in two genes (Figure 1C).
Among the 18 PD group, nine specimens were positive
for mutations in one gene, one specimen had mutations
in two genes, one specimen had mutations in three genes,
and one specimen had mutations in five genes. The
average numbers of mutations in the non-PD and PD

groups were 0.83 and 1.05, respectively (Table 2). These
values were not significantly different. Next, we excluded
the mutations in tumor suppressor genes (CTNNB1,
TP53, APC, and SMARCB1) and compared the number
of mutations in non-PD and in non-PD groups. Among
the 24 non-PD group, only three specimens were positive
for mutations in one gene. Among the 18 PD group, six
specimens were positive for mutations in one gene and
one specimen had mutations in three genes (Figure 1C).
The average numbers of mutations in the non-PD and PD
groups were 0.13 and 0.50, respectively, and these values
were significantly different (P = 0.0446, Chi-squared
test) (Table 2). This result suggests that the oncogene
mutational burden in the tumor might be associated with
the clinical response to sorafenib.
The 46 patients were classified into mutationpositive (one or more mutations) and mutation-negative
(no mutations) groups. The survival curves for these two
groups are shown in Figure 2A. The median progressionfree survival (PFS) periods of the patients with or without
gene mutations were 103 and 76 days, respectively (P =
0.3039, log-rank test). The median PFS of the patients

with or without gene mutations, excluding suppressor
genes, were 93 and 71 days (P = 0.1234, log-rank test),
respectively (Figure 2B). The mutation-negative group
tended to have a longer PFS, but the difference was not
statistically significant.

Analysis of gene expression
The gene expression analysis was performed using
targeted RNA sequencing. Fifty target genes, consisting
of receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligands, were selected
for RNA sequencing. The median read number for the
46 samples was 188,213 (range, 1,628 to 319,039). A
coverage of over 100,000 was achieved in 89.1% of the
RNA samples (41/46). The data from RNA sequencing
was normalized according to each read number. We then
compared the relative gene expressions between non-PD
and PD groups. The 4 NE patients were excluded from
the analysis. The expressions of TGFa (median, 74.1 vs.
20.3, P = 0.0180) and PECAM1 (median, 110.2 vs. 13.2,
P = 0.0131) were significantly increased in the non-PD
group (Figure 3). No other significant associations were

observed between the gene expression levels and the PFS
(Supplementary Table S3).
The median values for each gene were defined as the
cutoff values separating the high and low gene expression
groups. The PFS of the patients with a low NRG1
expression was longer than that of the patients with a high
NRG1 expression (Figure 4). The median PFS periods of
the patients with low and high NRG1 expressions were 98
and 80 days, respectively (P = 0.0497, log-rank test). The
expression of other genes, including TGFa and PECAM1,

were not associated with PFS (Supplementary Table S4).
These results suggest that the NRG1 expression level in
the tumor tissue might be a predictor of a good PFS.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we tested the use of FFPE
specimens of HCC tissue for DNA and RNA sequencing
using NGS technology. Most of the collected specimens
obtained by liver biopsy were small in size. DNA and

RNA were extracted at the same time from 10 slices of
one biopsy sample. The yields of DNA and RNA were
sufficient for the DNA and RNA sequencing, and all
the assays were successfully performed. Multiple gene
mutation and expression profiling of cancers has become
a research priority and is expected to lead to personalized
medicine for patients with many types of cancers. Many
studies have reported mutation profiles in HCC and have
identified approximately 30-40 mutations per tumor [1820]. TP53 and CTNNB1, which encodes β-catenin, are
frequently mutated in HCC. On the other hand, few novel
driver oncogene mutations have not been clarified in HCC.
In the present study, we analyzed the mutation profile
using targeted sequencing. Therefore, the numbers of
detected mutations were limited. However, the mutations
of these genes were frequently detected, suggesting that
both Wnt and TP53 signaling are frequently altered in
HCC.
In our study, we hypothesized that the oncogenic
mutational burden could be a possible predictive
biomarker for the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with
HCC. We tried to detect any difference in the number of
mutations in several oncogenes (NRAS, PTPN11, CSF1R,
ERBB2, FGFR2, FLT3, GNAQ, KRAS, and PIK3CA) and
found a significant difference in the number of oncogene
mutations between the non-PD and PD groups. This result
suggests that the oncogene mutational burden in the tumor
might be associated with the clinical response to sorafenib,
although a prospective study is necessary for confirmation.
In the RNA sequencing experiment, the expressions
of approximately 50 genes were successfully measured and
analyzed in all the biopsy samples, suggesting that FFPE
biopsy samples of HCC are suitable for RNA sequencing.
The increased gene expressions of TGFa and PECAM1,
which encodes CD31, were observed in non-PD group.
PECAM1 is expressed in endothelial cells and is a famous
vascular marker [21, 22]. A significantly high PECAM1
expression level was observed in the non-PD group,
suggesting that the vascular density of the tumor might
be associated with the response to sorafenib. However,
a significant difference in the PFS was not observed
between the high and low TGFa groups or between the
high and low PECAM1 groups. On the other hand, the
expression level of NRG1 was significantly correlated
with the PFS, although there was no difference in NRG1
expression between the non-PD and the PD groups. NRG1
(also known as heregulin) is a ligand for HER3 (human
epidermal growth factor receptor 3), and NRG1 stimulates
HER2/HER3 heterodimerization, leading to the activation
of HER2 signaling [23]. The EGFR antibody cetuximab is
an effective clinical therapy for patients with colorectal,
head and neck, and other solid tumors. We previously
reported that the activation of ERBB2 signaling through
the upregulation of NRG1 leads to cetuximab resistance
[24]. The increased expression of NRG1 increases the
autocrine signaling of HER2/HER3 in tumors. Thus, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activation of a bypass pathway mediated by NRG1 may
lead to sorafenib resistance.
We previously reported that HCC tumors with
FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification responded to sorafenib
[11]. In the presently reported series, we did not examine
FGF3/FGF4 amplification directly because of the limited
sample sizes. However, we roughly screened the gene
expressions of FGF3 and FGF4 using RNA sequencing
and did not observe any increase in the samples
(Supplementary Table S3). We considered these candidate
genes related to the sorafenib response to be independent
markers of FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification.
In this study, we selected TGFa, PECAM1, and
NRG1 as predictive gene expression markers. Is one
gene better than the others? In the present cohort, the
PFS of the non-PD group was significantly longer than
that of the PD group (106 days vs. 70 days, P = 0.0051,
log-rank test). Response and PFS are considered to be
good surrogates for evaluating the efficacy of sorafenib
treatment. In this study, we focused on unresectable HCC
treated with sorafenib. In this population, response is a
possible surrogate for overall survival, reportedly [25,
26]. In this clinical study, overall survival was largely
affected by post-sorafenib treatment including TACE, e.g.
because a post-treatment protocol has not been prescribed.
Therefore, the significance of these three markers should
be confirmed in further studies.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that 1) FFPE
biopsy samples of HCC can be used for targeted DNA
and RNA sequencing, 2) the tumor mutational burden is a
candidate predictor of sorafenib effectiveness, and 3) the
tumor gene expressions of NRG1, TGFa, and PECAM1
are candidate markers for the prediction of sorafenib
effectiveness. Further confirmatory studies will help to
establish the utility of this biomarker profile for HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and samples
Tumor specimens were obtained from a total of
46 HCC patients who chose to receive sorafenib at three
hospitals in the Japanese Red Cross Liver Study Group
between 2009 and 2013. All the patients received sorafenib
(800 mg/body/day or 400 mg/body/day in patients with
some risk factors [7]), and their responses were evaluated
using the RECIST criteria [27]. The response to sorafenib
was evaluated every 4–8 weeks by dynamic CT or MRI.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of each
institution. All the patients enrolled in the study provided
written informed consent for the use of tumor tissues.
The characteristics of the patients, including the efficacy
results, are shown in Table 1.

products and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads
(Beckman Coulter). Purified libraries were then pooled and
sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM device using the Ion
PGM 200 Sequencing kit v2 and the Ion 318 v2 Chip kit.
Relative expression (raw read number/total read number)
of each gene was calculated for the normalization.

The collected FFPE specimens underwent a
histological review, and only those containing sufficient
tumor cells as revealed by hematoxylin-eosin staining
were subjected to nucleic acid extraction. DNA and RNA
were purified using an Allprep DNA/RNA FFPE kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The quality and quantity of the DNA/
RNA were verified using the NanoDrop 2000 device
(Thermo Scientific Wilmington, DE), the PicoGreen
dsDNA assay kit (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA),
and the RiboGreen RNA assay kit (Life Technologies).
The extracted DNA/RNA was stored at –80°C until the
analysis.

Statistical analysis
A Chi-squared test was used to compare the number
of mutations and the treatment response. A non-parametric
statistical method (Mann-Whitney U-test) was used for
comparisons between the expressions of various genes
and treatment response. The Kaplan-Meier method and
the log-rank test were used to analyze survival. All the
statistical analyses were performed using JMP software
(ver 10, SAS Institute). A P value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

DNA sequencing
We used 10 ng of DNA for the multiplex PCR
amplification using the Ion AmpliSeq Library kit 2.0 (Life
Technologies) and the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel
v2 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The genes for DNA sequencing are listed
in Supplementary Table S5. The Ion Xpress Barcode
Adapters (Life Technologies) were ligated into the PCR
products and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The purified libraries were
then pooled and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM device
(Life Technologies) using the Ion PGM 200 Sequencing
kit v2 (Life Technologies) and the Ion 318 v2 Chip kit
(Life Technologies).
DNA sequencing data were accessed through the
Torrent Suite v.4.0 software program. Reads were aligned
against the hg19 human reference genome, and variants
were called using the variant caller ver 4.0. Raw variant
calls were filtered out using the following annotations:
homozygous and heterozygous variants, quality score of
<100, depth of coverage <19. Germline mutations were
excluded using the Human Genetic Variation Database
(http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB) [28].
