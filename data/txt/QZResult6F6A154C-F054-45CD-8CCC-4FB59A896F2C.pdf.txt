Abstract

Author Manuscript

Overexpression of human AP-endonuclease (APE1/Ref-1), a key enzyme in the DNA base
excision repair (BER) pathway, is often associated with tumor cell resistance to various anticancer
drugs. In this study, we examined the molecular basis of transcriptional regulatory (non repair)
function of APE1 in promoting resistance to certain types of drugs. We have recently shown that
APE1 stably interacts with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and acts as its coactivator for the
expression of multidrug resistance gene MDR1, thereby causing drug-resistance. Here we show
for the first time that APE1 is stably associated with the basic transcription factor RNA
polymerase II (RNA pol II) and the coactivator p300 on the endogenous MDR1 promoter. APE1’s
depletion significantly reduces YB-1/p300 recruitment to the promoter, resulting in reduced RNA
pol II loading. Drug-induced APE1 acetylation which is mediated by p300 enhances formation of
acetylated APE1 (AcAPE1)/YB-1/p300 complex on the MDR1 promoter. Enhanced recruitment of
this complex increases MDR1 promoter dependent luciferase activity and its endogenous
expression. Using APE1 downregulated cells and cells overexpressing wild type APE1 or its
nonacetylable mutant we have demonstrated that the loss of APE1’s acetylation impaired MDR1
activation and sensitizes the cells to cisplatin or etoposide. We have thus established the basis for
APE1’s acetylation-dependent regulatory function in inducing MDR1-mediated drug resistance.

The multifunctional mammalian AP-endonuclease (APE1) plays a central role in the DNA
base excision repair (BER) pathway for repairing damaged bases, abasic (AP) sites and their
oxidation products generated in the genome either spontaneously or after excision of
oxidized and alkylated bases by DNA glycosylases (Demple and Harrison, 1994; Doetsch
and Cunningham, 1990; Fan and Wilson, 2005; Izumi et al., 2003; Matsumoto and Kim,
1995; Mitra et al., 2002; Singhal et al., 1995). Unrepaired AP sites and DNA strand breaks
induce apoptosis and cytotoxicity (Loeb and Preston, 1986). Besides its repair function, the
mammalian APE1 possesses two unique and apparently distinct transcriptional regulatory
activities that require its nonconserved N-terminal domain (Bhakat et al., 2009; Evans et al.,
2000; Izumi et al., 2005; Tell et al., 2009). APE1 was identified as a reductive activator of
c-Jun invitro and named redox effector factor-1 (Ref-1; (Xanthoudakis and Curran, 1992)
and was subsequently shown to activate several other transcription factors e.g., NF-κB,
HIF1-α, p53, Pax5, Pax8, and c-Myb, presumably via its redox activity (Evans et al., 2000;
Jayaraman et al., 1997; Xanthoudakis et al., 1992). APE1 could also act as a trans-acting
factor that was discovered in the trans-acting complex that binds to the negative Ca2+
response elements (nCaRE-A and B) during Ca2+-dependent downregulation of the
parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene (Okazaki et al., 1994). The presence of the nCaRE-B
element and binding of APE1 to this element was also shown in the human renin gene
promoter (Fuchs et al., 2003). Thus APE1’s role as a regulatory factor in diverse transacting
complexes involved in the activation or repression of various genes were documented
(Bhakat et al., 2009). We discovered acetylation of human APE1 at Lys6 and Lys7 by the
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300 (Bhakat et al., 2003a), and that a
significant fraction of APE1 is normally present in the acetylated form (AcAPE1) in many
cell lines (Bhakat et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya et al., 2009; Chattopadhyay et al., 2008).
APE1’s acetylation is regulated by the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 both in cells and
invitro (Yamamori et al.,2010) and SIRT1 mediated deacetylation of APE1 enhances its
association with XRCC1 which regulates its BER activity (Yamamori et al.,2010). It
appears that APE1 is in dynamic equilibrium between its acetylated and unmodified state
and the fraction of APE1 that is acetylated varies among different tumor cell lines (Bhakat et
al., 2009). We showed that APE1 acetylation stimulates formation of the nCaRE-B complex
which contains hnRNP-L and HDAC1 leading to repression of the PTH gene (Bhakat et al.,
2003a; Kuninger et al., 2002). Similarly, Crowe’s group in collaboration with us has
recently shown that Helicobacter pylori infection induces acetylation of APE1 in gastric
epithelial cells; AcAPE1 suppresses Bax expression, and modulates p53-dependent
apoptosis of H. Pyroli-infected cells (Bhattacharyya et al., 2009). Furthermore, we have
shown that early growth response 1 (Egr-1)-mediated activation of phosphoinositol
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is dependent on APE1 acetylation (Fantini
et al., 2008). Thus we have established a novel role of acetylation-mediated transcriptional
regulatory function of APE1 in the regulation of diverse genes. APE1 was also found to be
ubiquitinated at multiple lysine residues in the N terminal region (Busso et al., 2009).
APE1 is often overexpressed in tumor cells, and its altered level or intracellular distribution
has been found in various cancer tissues including ovarian, cervical, prostate, glioma, head

and neck, and non-small-cell lung carcinomas (Evans et al., 2000; Kelley et al., 2001;
Robertson et al., 2001; Xu et al., 1997). APE1 overexpression is invariably associated with
resistance to various anticancer drugs; its downregulation or functional impairment
sensitizes cells to diverse genotoxic agents including MMS, H2O2, bleomycin, TMZ,
BCNU, etoposide, cisplatin and doxorubicin (Bapat et al., 2009; Bobola et al., 2005;
Chattopadhyay et al., 2008; Fishel and Kelley, 2007; Jiang et al., 2008; McNeill et al., 2009;
Robertson et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2004). While APE1-dependent repair of the cytotoxic
lesions induced by some of these agents, eg. MMS or H2O2 could explain enhanced
sensitivity to some chemicals, the DNA damage induced by many other drugs such as
etoposide or doxorubicin is not repaired via APE1-mediated BER pathway. Hence the
higher sensitivity to these drugs cannot be explained by the loss of APE1’s DNA repair
function. So, at least in these cases, the loss of APE1’s regulatory function is likely to be
responsible for drug sensitivity. In support of this possibility, we have recently shown that
APE1 stably interacts with YB-1, a major transcription factor for the activation of multidrug
resistance gene MDR1 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). The MDR1 gene product, Pglycoprotein, an N-glycosylated plasma membrane protein and a member of ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters consists of two highly homologous halves each of which
contains a transmembrane domain with several membrane spanning segments and an ATPbinding fold (Germann and Chambers, 1998). Increased level of this P-glycoprotein in
mammalian cells has been found to be related to ATP-dependent reduced drug accumulation
and this suggests its role as an energydependent drug efflux pump (Germann and Chambers,
1998). Overexpression of MDR1 confers resistance to a variety of structurally and
functionally unrelated antitumor drugs such as vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide and many
others (Chaudhary and Roninson, 1993; Goldstein et al., 1989; Gottesman et al., 2002;
Gottesman and Pastan, 1993; Kohno et al., 1989). Both transcriptional activation and gene
amplification have been implicated in acquisition of high levels of MDR1 expression in
intrinsic or acquired multidrug resistance in tumor cells (Kohno et al., 1994; Shen et al.,
1986). Furthermore, protein kinase C mediated phosphorylation of this transporter enhances
its drug-efflux and ATPase activity (Ahmad and Glazer, 1993; Ahmad et al., 1994; Yu et
al., 1991).

We showed that APE1 downregulation in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780
and doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF7 decreases their MDR1 levels and
sensitizes these cells to cisplatin or doxorubicin (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). However, the
molecular basis for YB-1 mediated activation of MDR1 by APE1 and its acetylation is not
clear. In this study, we have shown that drug-induced APE1 acetylation enhances YB-1/
p300 complex formation on MDR1 promoter. Furthermore, we have shown for the first time
that APE1 is stably associated with RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) on the MDR1
promoter and plays a key role in both basal and drug-induced recruitment of YB-1/p300
complex and RNA pol II loading. Thus, we have documented a novel mechanism by which
APE1 and its acetylation regulate MDR1 expression, and provided a molecular basis for
sensitization of cells to many drugs via APE1 downregulation.

Stable association of APE1 with p300 and RNA pol II

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We showed previously that APE1 is acetylated at Lys6/Lys 7 by p300 (Bhakat et al., 2003a)
and this acetylation enhances its association with YB-1 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). We
tested stable association between APE1 and p300 by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
analysis with nuclear extracts of HEK-293T cells ectopically expressing C-terminally
FLAGtagged full-length or N terminal 33 amino acid deleted (NΔ33) APE1. Western
analysis showed the presence of p300 in the FLAG IP of full length but not of NΔ33 APE1
(Figure 1a) indicating that the N terminal region of APE1 is required for its stable
interaction with p300. We further confirmed this interaction by reciprocal analysis and
showed the presence of APE1 in the FLAGp300 IP (Figure 1b). To test p300 mediated
acetylation of APE1 in cells, we downregulated cellular p300 level with siRNA in
HEK-293T cells and checked AcAPE1 level with our AcAPE1 specific antibody
(Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). p300 downregulation caused significant decrease in APE1
acetylation without affecting the total APE1 level (Figure 1c). Several studies have shown
that acetylation is a common strategy that p300/CBP utilizes to enhance interaction with
nonhistone proteins and that the p300 bromodomain is involved in binding to acetylated Lys
residues of partner proteins (Mujtaba et al., 2002). We examined whether APE1 acetylation
modulates its interaction with p300. We immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged wild type (WT)
APE1 or its nonacetylable K6R/K7R (RR) mutant from the nuclear lysates of Trichostatin A
(TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor; Yoshida et al., 1990) treated or control cells and
examined the level of p300 in the IPs. TSA treatment significantly enhanced the amount of
p300 bound to WT but not to RR APE1 (Figure 1d) indicating that acetylation enhances
APE1’s association with p300. This was further confirmed by invitro interaction of
unmodified or acetylated APE1 (Figure 1e) with FLAG- tagged p300. Higher level of bound
AcAPE1 compared to the unmodified APE1 was observed (Figure 1f).

Transcriptional activation by a transcription factor involves recruitment of various
coactivators to the specific binding site on DNA, which then directly or indirectly interacts
with components of the basal transcription machinery including RNA pol II and stabilizes
the transcription preinitiation complex (Cho et al., 1998). Because p300 is also known to
function as a bridging factor connecting sequence specific transcription factors with the
basal transcription machinery (Cho et al., 1998; Neish et al., 1998) including RNA pol II, it
is possible that APE1 could be associated with the RNA pol II transcription complex.
Western analysis of the FLAG IP of nuclear extract from cells expressing FLAG-APE1
showed the presence of RNA pol II in the immunoprecipitate of full length but not of NΔ33
APE1 (Figure 1a). As expected, we also showed the presence of RNA pol II in immuno-pull
down of FLAG-p300 (Figure 1b).
Requirement of APE1 in p300/YB-1complex formation and RNA pol II loading on MDR1
promoter
Several studies showed that YB-1 is a major transcription factor for MDR1 gene (Bargou et
al., 1997; Kohno et al., 1994). Because p300 interacts with both YB-1 and APE1, we asked
whether the interaction between YB-1 and p300 is mediated by APE1. We generated a

HEK- 293T cell line stably expressing APE1 siRNA (APE1siRNAHEK-293T) driven by
doxycycline (Dox) inducible promoter as described earlier (Vascotto et al., 2009). After
7-10 days of Dox treatment, endogenous APE1 expression was minimal compared to cells
expressing control siRNA (Figure 2a). We transfected APE1
downregulated APE1siRNAHEK-293T cells with p300-FLAG construct and
immunoprecipitated the nuclear extracts with FLAG Ab for Western analysis. Significant
reduction in the amount of YB-1 bound to p300 was observed in the IP from APE1
downregulated cells compared to control cells (Figure 2b). These results indicate APE1’s
requirement in facilitating YB-1/p300 complex formation.

In order to examine whether APE1-dependent YB-1/p300 complex formation is essential for
MDR1 expression, we showed their occupancy on the MDR1 promoter Y-box element by
ChIP assay in HEK-293T cells with antibodies to APE1, YB-1, p300 or RNA pol II. The
amount of immunoprecipitated MDR1 promoter sequence or a coding sequence of this gene
distant to the Y-box element was quantified by Real Time PCR analysis. Significant
enrichment of the MDR1 promoter Y-box element and not of the coding sequence was
observed with APE1, p300, YB-1 or RNA pol II antibody as compared to control IgG
(Figure 2c), indicating that all of these proteins are stably and specifically associated with
MDR1 promoter. To establish their simultaneous promoter occupancy, we performed reChIP assays using HEK-293T cells transfected with APE1-FLAG construct.
Immunoprecipitated chromatin with FLAG antibody or control IgG was secondarily
immunoprecipitated with p300, YB-1 or RNA pol II antibody. Significant enrichment of the
MDR1 promoter was observed in the FLAG IP as compared to control IgG (Figure 2c)
confirming association of FLAG-APE1 with MDR1 promoter. Figure 2d provides strong
evidence for simultaneous association of p300, YB-1 and RNA pol II with APE1 on the Ybox element on MDR1 promoter because APE1-bound chromatin (FLAG IP) could be
immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies as compared to control IgG.

We next examined whether APE1 is necessary for the recruitment of p300, YB-1 and RNA
pol II on MDR1 promoter. ChIP analysis was performed in cisplatin treated or control APE1
downregulated APE1siRNAHEK-293T cells. Figure 2e shows that APE1 downregulation
significantly reduced p300, YB-1 and RNA pol II occupancy on the MDR1 promoter. MDR1
promoter sequence was enriched in the IPs with p300, YB-1 or RNA pol II antibody after
cisplatin treatment which was inhibited by APE1 downregulation (Figure 2e). These results
suggest that APE1 is required for both basal and drug-induced enhanced binding/recruitment
of p300 and YB-1 to the Y-box element which enhances RNA pol II loading on the MDR1
promoter. The functional consequence of reduced binding of YB-1/p300 and RNA pol II
loading on MDR1 promoter in APE1 downregulated cells was directly tested by measuring
the endogenous MDR1 transcript levels by Real Time RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 2f,
MDR1 level was increased by 3-fold following cisplatin treatment relative to untreated
control which was significantly inhibited in APE1 downregulated cells.

Drug induced oxidative stress enhances APE1’s acetylation and its association with YB-1/
p300 on MDR1 promoter

Author Manuscript

Many DNA damaging agents including chemotherapeutic drugs induce oxidative stress in
cells (Kovacic, 2007; Kovacic and Osuna, 2000). To examine whether oxidative stress
enhances the AcAPE1 level, we measured its level in HEK-293T cells after treatment with
glucose oxidase (GO; 100 ng/ml) or cisplatin (40 ng/ml) for 1 hour. While no significant
change in the APE1 polypeptide level was observed, the AcAPE1 level increased
significantly after treatment (Figure 3a). Enhancement of APE1 acetylation after drug
treatment may be likely to be due to oxidative stress-mediated enhancement of HAT activity
of p300 (Rahman, 2002). Because genotoxic agents elevate the AcAPE1 level, we examined
the effect of oxidative stress on AcAPE1/YB- 1/p300 complex formation. We transfected
HEK-293T cells with p300-FLAG and treated the cells with GO. Western analysis of FLAG
IP showed enhanced association of YB-1 with p300 (Figure 3b). While the amount of APE1
associated with p300 under oxidative stress remained unaltered, increased AcAPE1 level in
the p300 complex indicates that oxidative stress enhanced APE1 acetylation, which in turn
increased the amount of YB-1 in the p300 bound complex (Figure 3b). We also observed
enhanced association of p300 and YB-1 in FLAG APE1 IP after treatment with GO (Figure
3c) or cisplatin (Figure 3d). Thus drug-induced oxidative stress raised the level of AcAPE1
and its association with YB-1/p300. This enhanced the assembly/recruitment of AcAPE1/
YB-1/p300 complex to the MDR1 promoter and consequently could help RNA pol II
loading.

Author Manuscript

We then directly tested the presence of AcAPE1 on MDR1 promoter by ChIP analysis.
Significant enrichment of MDR1 promoter with AcAPE1 Ab over control IgG (Figure 3e)
indicates AcAPE1’s stable association with MDR1 promoter. Furthermore, significantly
increased enrichment of the MDR1 promoter in the IP with AcAPE1 antibody relative to
APE1 antibody after cisplatin treatment indicates that drug-induced APE1 acetylation
enhances its promoter recruitment (Figure 3e). ChIP assay (Figure 3f) in HEK-293T cells
transfected with FLAG-tagged WT APE1, RR, acetylation mimic K6Q/K7Q (QQ) or NΔ33
APE1 constructs with FLAG antibody shows that replacing lysine to acetylation mimic
glutamine did not affect APE1’s association with MDR1 promoter; but changing lysine
residues to nonacetylable arginine significantly reduced its promoter association.
Furthermore, NΔ33 abolished APE1’s promoter association. Together, these data suggest
that APE1 acetylation enhances its recruitment on the MDR1 promoter.
p300-mediated APE1 acetylation enhances Y-box-dependent MDR1 promoter activity

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the functional consequence of APE1 acetylation and its enhanced binding with
p300 and YB-1 on its transcriptional coactivator function, we performed MDR1 promoterdependent luciferase assay and Real Time RT-PCR assay to measure endogenous MDR1
transcript level. We examined the effect of overexpression of WT APE1, acetylation mimic
QQ, nonacetylable RR or NΔ33 APE1 mutants. Figure 4a shows that overexpression of WT
or QQ APE1 but not RR or NΔ33 APE1 mutant significantly enhanced MDR1 promoter
activity indicating that APE1 acetylation is required for this activity. Figure 4b shows that
while ectopic expression of WT or QQ APE1 increased endogenous MDR1 expression by
more than 2- fold relative to empty vector, the RR or NΔ33 mutant had no significant effect.

To further evaluate the effect of APE1 acetylation, we examined the effect of p300 level on
MDR1 promoter activity. Figure 4a shows that p300 overexpression activated the MDR1
promoter. To confirm that p300-mediated activation of the MDR1 promoter is mediated
through APE1, it was downregulated in APE1siRNAHEK-293T cells before cotransfection
with MDR1 promoter-reporter and p300 expression plasmids. As predicted, APE1
downregulation significantly reduced MDR1 promoter activity compared to the control cells
(Figure 4c). p300 overexpression had less stimulatory effect in APE1-downregulated cells,
confirming that p300-mediated activation of MDR1 promoter is dependent on the APE1
level (Figure 4c). Similarly p300 overexpression significantly increased MDR1 transcript
level in Dox-untreated cells relative to empty vector, but had less effect in APE1
downregulated cells (Figure 4d). Moreover, while overexpression of p300 or WT APE1
individually activated the MDR1 promoter, simultaneous overexpression of p300 and WT
but not RR had a synergistic effect (Figure 4e). These results confirm the acetylation
dependent regulatory role of APE1 in enhancing MDR1 promoter activity and its expression.
Acetylation-dependent transcriptional regulatory function of APE1 is critical for resistance
to cisplatin or etoposide

Author Manuscript

APE1 knockdown sensitizes cells to different chemotherapeutic drugs and induces cell death
(Bapat et al., 2009; Bobola et al., 2005; Chattopadhyay et al., 2008; Fishel and Kelley,
2007; Vascotto et al., 2009). To understand APE1’s role in drug resistance we examined the
effect of cisplatin treatment on cell cycle progression of APE1 downregulated and control
cells by FACS analysis. Cisplatin treatment of control APE1siRNAHEK-293T cells results in
an increase in cells at G2/M stage with a parallel decrease of G1 population (Figure 5a, 5b
and 5e). When the endogenous APE1 level was downregulated by Dox treatment,
significantly more cells were arrested at G2/M stage following cisplatin treatment (Figure
5c, 5d and 5e). Next, clonogeneic survival assays were performed in control and APE1
knockdown cells to measure the cytotoxicity to cisplatin and etoposide. Figures 6a and 6c
show that downregulation of APE1 significantly enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and
etoposide as compared to untreated control which support our earlier observation
(Chattopadhyay MCB 2008). Dox treatment itself did not affect the survival of the cells with
control siRNA (data not shown). Additionally, while ectopic overexpression of WT APE1 or
QQ mutant increased resistance to drug-induced cytotoxicity, the RR mutant did not confer
resistance to these drugs (Figures 6b and 6d). These results indicate that acetylationmediated transcriptional regulatory function of APE1 plays a critical role in protecting the
cells from cisplatin or etoposide-induced cytotoxicity.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Although various mechanisms of drug resistance including alterations of glutathione
mediated detoxification and enhanced DNA repair (Kaina and Christmann, 2002; Kaina et
al., 2001) have been identified in different cancer cell lines, resistance to many common
anticancer drugs often occurs due to enhanced expression of MDR1 and other ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter proteins in intrinsically drug-resistant cancer cells, as well as in
many tumors that acquire drug resistance after chemotherapy (Ambudkar et al., 2005;
Gottesman et al., 2002; Gottesman and Pastan, 1993). These transporters reduce intracellular

drug concentration by acting as efflux pumps. Several studies have shown that MDR1
expression is often upregulated due to promoter activation by YB-1 following drug
treatment (Chaudhary and Roninson, 1993; Kohno et al., 1989; Kohno et al., 1994). Our
earlier study showed that APE1 stably interacts with YB-1 and enhances YB-1’s binding to
Y-box element on the MDR1 promoter leading to its activation (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008).
In this study, we have shown that APE1 is associated with RNA pol II on the endogenous
MDR1 promoter and it is required for both basal and druginduced recruitment of YB-1/p300
complex to the promoter for facilitating RNA pol II loading. Furthermore, our data suggest
that drug-induced p300-mediated APE1 acetylation enhances assembly/recruitment of
AcAPE1/YB-1/p300 complex on the promoter and plays a critical role in enhancing MDR1
expression. Thus, our study for the first time has provided the basis for non repair function
of APE1 for facilitating MDR1 expression.

Some earlier studies showed that APE1 stimulates the DNA-binding of several transcription
factors through its redox regulatory function. Initial studies suggested Cys 65 of human
APE1/Ref-1 (Cys 64 of mouse APE1/Ref-1) to be critical for redox regulation (Walker et
al., 1993), however, subsequent analyses showed that neither Cys 65 nor other cysteine
residues are involved in redox regulation (Ando et al., 2008; Ordway et al., 2003). We
observed that the C65S and C138S mutants behaved like WT APE1 in modulating YB-1dependent MDR1 promoter activity (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008), suggesting that APE1’s
redox activity may not be involved in MDR1 activation. YB-1, a transcriptional regulator
(Kohno et al., 2003), binds to the cognate Y-box element and recruits p300/CBP (Higashi et
al., 2003). We showed earlier that APE1 stably interacts with YB-1 and its acetylation
enhances its binding to Y box sequence. The observation that deletion of the N-terminal 33
aa which is essential for YB-1 binding (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008) abolished APE1’s
promoter association, indicates that this interaction is essential for promoter recruitment.
Our ChIP results provided strong evidence for simultaneous MDR1 promoter occupancy of
APE1, YB-1, p300 and RNA pol II. We have shown that APE1 downregulation reduced
recruitment of the YB-1/p300 complex and of RNA pol II loading on the promoter. It
appears likely that the transcriptional activator YB-1 recruits coactivator p300 and APE1 to
the promoter which enhances YB-1/p300 binding to the promoter. This induces unfolding of
the chromatin structure presumably via p300’s intrinsic HAT activity and thereby facilitates
RNA pol II complex loading. Furthermore, drug induced enhanced APE1 acetylation and
recruitment of AcAPE1/YB-1/p300 complex to the promoter may cause p300 to
communicate with the basal transcription machineries near the transcription start site and
thereby stabilize the RNA pol II preinitiation complex. Because the Y-box element (-82 to
-73) on the MDR1 promoter is quite close to the transcription start site and p300 may
function as a bridging factor between the trans-acting complexes and the basal transcription
machinery (Blobel, 2000; Neish et al., 1998), it is likely that APE1 is stably associated with
RNA pol II preinitiation complex. Specifically, p300 interacts with the unphosphorylated
form of RNA pol II which is competent in forming the transcription preinitiation complex
(Cho et al., 1998). One recent study also showed that APE1 interacts with estrogen alpha
receptor and is associated with its endogenous promoter for activation of estrogenresponsive gene expression (Curtis et al., 2009). In any case, identification of APE1 as a

RNA pol II-associated protein and its requirement in facilitating the RNA pol II loading on
the promoter in the context of MDR1 expression is a significant finding of this study.

It appears that overexpression of both YB-1 and APE1, often observed in tumor cells, is
associated with resistance to various drugs by activating MDR1. Our earlier study showed
that APE1 downregulation in cisplatin resistant A2780/100 and doxorubicin-resistant
MCF7MDR1 cell lines decreased their MDR1 levels and enhanced drug sensitivity
(Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). Consistent with this, one recent study has shown that
upregulation of MDR1 levels in breast cancer tissues in mice is associated with their
sensitivity to doxorubicin (Pajic et al., 2009). Although we do not have direct evidence that
APE1 or its acetylation mediated regulatory function affect drug transport, activation of
MDR1 expression by WT APE1 but not its acetylation mutant support its indirect
involvement in enhancing export of the drugs. In the event of drug exposure, an immediate
increase in the MDR1 level is warranted for enhancing export of the drugs which could be
affected by enhancing APE1 acetylation. However, it is obvious that acetylation of the
APE1 is not the sole mechanism for drug resistance; it is a very complex issue considering
the interplay of multiple factors. Moreover, the balance between acetyl transferases and
deacetylases that control the acetylation of APE1 and other proteins could indirectly regulate
drug resistance. Nevertheless, our data show that specific knockdown of endogenous APE1
by conditional expression of siRNA, sensitized cells to cisplatin or etoposide which could be
overcome by WT APE1 or the acetylation mimic QQ mutant but not by the acetylation
deficient RR mutant. Together, these results confirm that resistance to these drugs is
primarily dependent on APE1’s acetylation dependent coregulatory function by modulating
MDR1 level.

Finally, we would like to stress that this study provides the first evidence for the
involvement of APE1’s transcriptional regulatory function in recruitment of the transcription
factors/coactivators and facilitating RNA pol II loading on the promoter and thus documents
a novel mechanism by which APE1 and its acetylation controls YB-1-mediated activation of
MDR1 gene. Although other factors such as NF-Y, AP-1 may also modulate MDR1
expression (Jin and Scotto, 1998; Okamura et al., 2004), we have provided strong evidence
for the key role of APE1 and its acetylation in MDR1 activation, suggesting that the
transactivation function of APE1 could be used as a novel therapeutic target.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, plasmids and transfection

Author Manuscript

HEK-293T cell line was cultured in DMEM-high glucose medium (Gibco-BRL) with 10%
fetal calf serum. The HEK-293T cells stably expressing APE1 siRNA or control siRNA
under doxycycline inducible promoter were generated as described earlier (Vascotto et al.,
2009) by selection with blasticidin (Gibco-BRL; 5 μg/ml) and zeocine (Gibco-BRL; 100 μg/
ml). The APE1 siRNA expressing HEK-293T clone (APE1siRNAHEK-293T) that showed
maximum APE1 knockdown by treatment with Doxycycline (Dox, Sigma) was used in
subsequent experiments. Cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
PCMV 5.1 FLAG expression plasmids for wild type (WT) APE1, K6R/K7R (RR) APE1, N
terminal 33 amino acid deleted (NΔ33) APE1 and p300 were described elsewhere (Bhakat
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 27.

and Mitra, 2000; Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). The PCMV 5.1 FLAG tagged K6Q/K7Q
(QQ) APE1 expression plasmid was generated by site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
The p300 siRNA used was described earlier (Bhakat et al., 2006).
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western analysis
Immunoprecipitation (IP) was done with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated
agarose beads (Sigma) in nuclear extracts of cells transfected with FLAG tagged constructs
as described previously (Bhakat et al., 2006; Chattopadhyay et al., 2008; Das et al., 2007).
The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE and identified by Western
analysis with the indicated antibodies; rabbit α-APE1 (Ramana et al., 1998), rabbit αAcAPE1 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008), rabbit α-YB-1 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2008; Das et
al., 2007), rabbit α-p300 (N15; Santa Cruz), rabbit α-RNA pol II (N20; Santa Cruz), mouse
α-FLAG (M2; Sigma) and mouse α-β-actin (AC15; Sigma).

Luciferase assay
Cells were cotransfected with MDR1 promoter reporter constructs (Chattopadhyay et al.,
2008) and the expression plasmids for WT, RR, QQ or NΔ33 APE1 and p300. Luciferase
activity in the cells extracts was measured in a luminometer (AutoLumant LB 953;
Berthold) using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized
with respect to total protein content of the lysates.
RNA isolation and Real Time RT-PCR assay

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from cells with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit followed by DNase 1
(NEB) treatment and cDNA synthesis using Superscript III first-strand synthesis kit
(Invitrogen). MDR1 expression in the samples were analysed by SYBR GREEN based Real
Time PCR (7000 Fast Real-Time PCR System; Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Premix
Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and primers appropriate for MDR1 (forward: 5’CCCATCATTGCAATAGCAGG-3’ and reverse: 5’-TGTTCAAACTTCTGCTCCTGA-3)
or HPRT1 expression (internal control; primer sequences: RealTimePrimers.com).
Invitro acetylation and binding assay
Recombinant APE1 (2 μg) was acetylated with recombinant p300 HAT domain polypeptide
in the presence of 1 mM acetyl CoA as described previously (Bhakat et al., 2003b).
Acetylated or unmodified APE1 (100 ng) was incubated with p300 FLAG-IP beads and
eluted with SDS Laemmli buffer for Western analysis with APE1 or FLAG antibodies.
Chromation immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Author Manuscript

ChIP assay was performed using Magna chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate)
with the following antibodies; α-RNA pol II (N20), α-p300 (N15), α-YB-1, α-APE1 (Novus
Biologicals), α-AcAPE1, α-FLAG (M2) or control IgG (Santa Cruz). The
immunoprecipitated purified DNA was then subjected to SYBR GREEN based Real Time
PCR with primers (forward: 5’-TCTCGAGGAATCAGCATTCA-3’ and reverse: 5’AAGAGCCGCTACTCGAATGA-3’) for the MDR1 promoter sequence (-138 to +18)
containing the Y-box element and a sequence of the MDR1 gene distant to the Y-box

element (forward: 5’- AACTGAGGAGATGGGGCATA-3’ and reverse: 5’TGGGAACAAATCACTGATCG-3’). For re-ChIP assay, after the first IP was performed
with FLAG antibody or control IgG, the second IP was performed in the eluents with RNA
pol II, p300 or YB-1 antibody or control IgG .
Cell cycle assay

Author Manuscript

Cell cycle studies were performed by flow cytometry using a BD FACSCanto (Becton
Dickinson). About 106 cells washed and resuspended in PBS were fixed in 100% ethanol at
-20°C for 15 mins and then rehydrated in PBS at room temperature. The cells were then
stained with 3μM propidium iodide in Staining buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP40 and 0.2 mg/ml RNase A,
incubated at room temperature for 15 mins in dark and analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson
FACSCanto using an Ar laser (excitation 488 nm). For each sample, 10,000 single events
were detected and data analysis was performed using FACSDiva version 6.1.2 software
programme.
Clonogenic survival assay
Endogenous APE1 downregulated APE1siRNAHEK-293T or control cells were plated on 35
mm dishes (~300 cells/dish). Next day, the cells were treated with cisplatin (0-125 μM) or
etoposide (0-20 μM) and allowed to grow for 10-14 days until visible colonies appear. In
another set, after APE1 downregulation the cells were transfected with WT, RR or QQ
APE1 expression constructs. Forty eight hours later, the cells were plated on 35 mm dishes
and proceeded for testing drug sensitivity. The colonies were fixed with 100% methanol,
stained with giemsa staining solution (1:50) and counted.

Requirement of APE1 in YB-1/p300 recruitment and RNA pol II loading on MDR1
promoter. (a) HEK-293T cells expressing APE1 siRNA (APE1siRNAHEK-293T cells) or
control duplex siRNA (ControlsiRNAHEK-293T cells) under a Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible
promoter were established following the procedure described in Materials & Methods.
These cells were treated with Dox (1ug/ml) for the indicated times and APE1 levels were
measured by Western analysis; β-actin antibody was used as a loading control. (b)
APE1siRNAHEK-293T cells were treated with (+) or without (-) Dox for 8 days and then the
