ABSTRACT
Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are one of the most abundant transcription
factors in the human cells. They regulate expression of genes via interactions with
corresponding ligands, co-activators, and co-repressors. These molecular pathways
play important roles in the development, cell differentiation, and physiologic and
metabolic processes. Increasingly, targeting nuclear receptors is becoming a
promising strategy for new drug development. The aim of this review is to discuss the
association between nuclear receptors and eye development, and expand their role
in various ocular diseases such as keratitis, cataract, glaucoma, uveitis, retinopathy,
and ophthalmic tumors. Recent studies in this area are highlighted as well as future
research directions and potential clinical applications. Finally, various strategies will
be elucidated to inspire more targeted therapies for ocular diseases through the use
of nuclear receptors.

INTRODUCTION

As an evolutionarily conserved yet functionally
diverse group of transcription factors, NRs interact
directly with DNA response elements of target genes, as
well as “cross-talk” with other signaling pathways. The
intermediary factors in these pathways, known as corepressors or co-activators, further modulate transcription.
Understanding the orchestrated activity of co-repressor
and co-activator complexes has elucidated the general
molecular mechanism of various receptor responses, such
as those involved in the development and maintenance of
photoreceptor cells with rods and cones [7]. NRs control
intricate regulatory signaling pathways in human health
and disease progression [57]. Particularly, as the focus of
this review, NRs are critical in both eye development and
pathogenesis of ocular diseases [4-7].
Because of the immense involvement in numerous
functions and their affinity to small molecule ligands,
NRs have become a strategic therapeutic target for many
diseases. With small molecules, drug design can be easily
manipulated, and the effect they can have might exceed
that of the endogenous ligand counterparts. For example,
dexamethasone, a common anti-inflammatory medication,

Nuclear receptors (NR) or nuclear hormone
receptors are a family of receptors that interact with
hormonal factors in nucleus and regulate gene expression.
The spectrum of functions they affect is vast and
includes development, reproduction, differentiation,
metabolism, and homeostasis [1]. The basic signaling
pathway of NRs involves a signal production (whether
it be endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine), its transport to
peripheral organs, ligand binding to the receptor, and
transcriptional activation. The ligands commonly consist
of lipophilic hormones, such as steroids and retinoids,
that diffuse through the lipid bilayer, allowing more
flexible physiological activity both intracellularly and
extracelluarly [1]. NRs can also sense xenobiotics and play
a significant role in detoxification [1]. Finally, there are
“orphan receptors” whose ligands do not exist or are yet
to be found. Discovering novel ligands and the potential
functions for these orphan receptors is an additional path
for drug development.

binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and exerts a
higher biological response than cortisol [1]. Ligands
for various NRs such as the estrogen receptor (ER) and
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) have
been synthetized for pharmacological treatments of cancer
and diabetes. Due to the success of these NR-targeted
clinical applications, identifying novel signaling pathways
and designing agonist/antagonist ligands for NRs have
resulted in some promising research initiatives in the area
of ophthalmology. The aim of this review is to discuss the
basic concepts behind nuclear receptors, the association
between nuclear receptors and development of ocular
diseases, and highlight recent studies in this area as well
as future research directions.

of NRs are known [1]. There are several nomenclatures
for NRs. Initially the NRs were subdivided into steroid
hormone receptors and non-steroid hormone receptors
based on the ligands being steroidal or non-steroidal. The
steroidal hormone receptors include mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), androgen
receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen
receptor (ER) . The non-steroidal hormone receptors
include thyroid hormone receptor (TR), vitamin D3
receptor (VDR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR), retinoid X
receptor (RXR) and others. These two types of NRs were
subsequently named Type I and Type II NRs respectively.
With the development of molecular cloning technology,
more and more proteins were found to share a similar
structure with the NR superfamily, but no endogenous
ligand existed for them or no endogenous ligand was
found at the time. Therefore, these receptors were
defined as “orphan receptors”. One of the examples is the
estrogen-related receptor (ERR). Also, NRs have been
subdivided into 4 subtypes according to the DNA binding

NRS

Currently, there are more than 300 hundred members
in NRs superfamily across species; and in human, 48 types

characteristic and dimerization preferences of NRs. In
1999, the Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee
categorized NRs into six subfamilies according to
sequence homology, and in the convenience of naming
newly discovered NRs, the non-typical NRs with only
one-conserved domain were classified into subfamily 0.

The inactivated steroid hormone receptors (SRs)
commonly bind to heat shock proteins (HSP) such as
HSP70 orHSP90 in the cytosol, and HSPs prevents the
translocation of SRs into nucleus, thus stopping SRs from
binding to DNA in the nucleus. Ligand binding to SRs in
the cytosol can induce a conformational change in SRs,
which leads to the dissociation of heat shock proteins. The
dissociated proteins become homo-dimers and, translocate
from the cytosol into the nucleus. Then they bind to the
hormone response elements (HREs) that are specific
sequences of DNA. They recruit co-activators that regulate
the transcription of DNA into mRNA. Mechanistic actions
of non-steroid hormone receptors are different from that of
SRs (Figure 2).
The non-steroid receptors such as TRs, RARs and
VDRs, are located in the nucleus. They bind to HREs as
heterodimers. They are then complexed to co-repressor
proteins, which in turn activate histone deacetylase.
The histone deacetylation makes a more condensed
conformation of histone proteins near HREs, thus
inhibiting target gene transcription. After the ligands bind
to the nuclear receptor, the co-repressors are dissociated
and co-activator proteins are recruited. RNA polymerase
and other additional proteins are also recruited to the NR/
DNA complex that initiate the transcription of DNA into
mRNA (Figure 3).

STRUCTURE OF NUCLEAR RECEPTORS
(NRS)
A typical NR contains 5 domains, designated as A/B,
C, D, E, and F domain. The A/B domain varied greatly in
sequence in different receptors. It contains the activation
function 1 (AF-1) which functions independently in
binding with a ligand. The C domain is the DNA-binding
domain (DBD). It contains two zinc fingers and is a
highly conserved domain. The D domain contains the
nucleus localization sequence (NLS), and is thought to
be a flexible domain that connects the DBD with the E
domain, also known as the ligand binding domain (LBD).
The largest domain, E domain, has the activation function
2 (AF-2). E domain is highly conserved in structure and
moderately conserved in sequence in different nuclear
receptors. Its function is not dependent on the ligand.
In addition, some NRs contain the F domain, which is
localized at the C terminus and varied greatly in sequence
in different nuclear receptors; its structure and function
remains unclear.(Figure 1)

Figure 2: Regulation of gene expression by steroid hormone receptors. The inactivated SRs commonly bind to HSPs that

prevent the translocation of SRs into the nucleus. Ligand binding to SRs in the cytosol causes the conformational change of SRs, which
results in the dissociation of HSPs, translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, binding to HREs as well as recruiting co-activators
that are responsible for transcription of downstream DNA into mRNA. Abbreviations: SRs: steroid hormone receptors; HSP: heat shock
protein; HREs: hormone response elements; Co-Act: Co-activators.

NRS AND EYE DEVELOPMENT

role of COUP-TFs in the regulation of the developing
eyes in embryo, and found that COUP-TFs regulated the
development of embryo eyes via directly or indirectly
modulating the eye morphogenesis-related transcriptional
factors including Pax2/6, Otx2, Mitf, Vaxl/2 etc. Bosch et
al. [6] found that six patients with CVI and/or optic nerve
abnormalities, have either deletions of NR2F1(COUPTFI) or heterozygous missense mutations in NR2F1.
Their study suggests that NR2F1 has a significant
function in regulating the neurodevelopment of visual
system. Disruption of NR2F1 can result in intellectual
disability and optic atrophy. Mollema et al. [7] found that
Nr1d1 and its cofactor Nr2e3 play an important role in
regulating transcriptional networks that are important for
the development and function of photoreceptor (Figure 4).

Olivares AM et al. [2] reviewed the role of nuclear
receptors on the eye and brain development and function.
They summarized that Vitamin A, RARβ and RA are
essential for eye development and maintenance. In
addition, Nr2e3 plays a dual regulation role in regulating
the development and function of rod and cone cells. Li
et al. [3], examined the protein expression of an orphan
receptor, NGFIB-β in the rat retina during development by
immunohistochemistry. The study showed that NGFIB-β
plays a significant role in regulating the differentiation
and maturation of rat retinal amacrine neurons. Tang
et al. [4] showed that the chicken ovalbumin upstream
promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) were highly
expressed in the eyes of developing embryos. Pax6 and
Otx2 were regulated by COUP-TF1 (also named EAR3 or NR2FI) and COUP-TFII (also named as ARP-1 and
NR2F2), respectively. The analysis on the phenotypic
change of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII conditional singlegene knockout mouse model indicates that COUP-TFI
and COUP-TFII compensate for each other to maintain
the morphogenesis of the eye. However, progenitor cells
at the dorso-distal optic vesicle failed to appropriately
differentiate in the eye-specific COUP-TFI/TFII doublegene knockout mouse. Du et al. [5], summarized the

NRS AND OCULAR DISEASES
NRs and keratitis
Fungal keratitis (FK) refers to an infective process
of the cornea caused by any of the pathological fungi.
Most of the fungal keratitis leads to loss of vision or
blindness. The treatment of the disease is a challenge
because of the lack of effective antifungal drugs that could

penetrate into the corneal epithelia. At the beginning of
infection, invasion of pathogens are recognized by the
immune system and secretion of inflammatory mediators
such as cytokines and chemokines may be triggered.
The invaded pathogens could be killed by neutrophils
recruited by the inflammatory mediators. However,
excessive inflammatory mediators need to be reduced
in the late stage of disease [8]. All-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) is the carboxylic acid form of vitamin A. ATRA
was found to regulate targeted gene expressions to exert
its anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory functions
via binding to RARα, β, γ and RXR α, β, γ receptors [9].
In addition, ATRA also inhibited the expression of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), which play an important
role in FK development [10]. Therefore, ATRA has been
regarded as a potential treatment modality for FK. Zheng
et al. [11], examined the expressions of MMPs in cultured
corneal fibroblasts and found that CD347 is a selective
agonist of RAP γ. Inhibition of the expression of MMP1,2,3,9
can slow down corneal degradation, suggesting a potential
role of CD347 in the treatment of corneal ulcer. In a

research based on VEGF-induced neovascular rat cornea
model, Sarayba et al [12] reported that pioglitazone is
effective in decreasing the formation of angiogenesis. In
another article, the authors pointed out that rosiglitazone
effectively controlled corneal fibrosis in vivo and in
vitro. It provides a basis for the prevention and treatment
of corneal scar [13]. It is note worthy that pioglitazone
and rosiglitazone are ligands of PPARγ. In the early
stage of corneal alkali burn, PPARγ agonists inhibited
inflammatory reaction, reduced the fibrotic reaction and
prevented the formation of angiogenesis. PPARγ agonists
may provide a new method of treatment for keratitis and
corneal trauma [14,15].

NRs and cataract
Various studies have shown that long term use of
corticosteroids in patients with autoimmune diseases,
allergy and organ transplantation contributes to the
development of posterior sub-capsular cataract [16-18]. It
was reported that RU486, the glucocorticoid receptor(GR)

antagonist, decreased the expression of Na, K-ATPase α1
in the lens of rat. In addition, dexamethasone treatment
reduced the expression of vimentin. These results indicate
that the decrease of Na, K-ATPase and vimentin mediated
by GR may result in the formation of steroid-induced
cataract [19,20]. It was showed that GRs participated
in the process of cell apoptosis in human lens. [21].
However, RU486, the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist
does not fully rescue the cell apoptosis, which may be due
to the failure of RU486 to inhibit Bax expression and its
elevation of the caspase-3 protein expression. Colitz et al.
[22] found that ERα was up-regulated in epithelial cells
of cataractous canine lens, but its underlying mechanisms
require further investigation. In addition, cataract
associated lens opacification is primarily due to the loss of
Ca2+ homeostasis and subsequent activation of calpains.
It was demonstrated that stimulation of RARα decreased
Ca2+ influx into the lens and reduced the over activation
of calpains. RARα can potentially be used for prevention
and treatment of human diabetic cataracts [23].

Glucocorticoids exert biological functions by
mediating GR, and have been extensively used as antiinflammatory drugs and immune suppressants in ocular
diseases and for post-ophthalmic surgery. Increasing
intraocular pressure is a commonly observed side effect
of glucocorticoid treatment. The pathogenesis may be
due to the inhibition of the activity of lysosomes by
glucocorticoid, which in turn results in an accumulation
of mucopolysaccharide due to its reduced clearance by
the trabecular meshwork. In addition, the pathogenesis
of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma may be attributed to
its modulation of the cytoskeleton trabecular meshwork.
The binding between glucocorticoid and GR involves high
specificity and saturation, and the effects of glucocorticoid
depends on the number of GRs in the cytosol. Therefore,
an individual’s sensitivity to glucocorticoid depends on
the number of GR in the trabecular meshwork. Zhang et

al. [24] showed that GR concentration in the peripheral
blood lymphocytes of rabbits is proportion to the GR
number in the trabecular meshwork. Measurement of
GR in the peripheral blood lymphocytes may be helpful
in determining the glucocorticoid sensitivity in steroidinduced glaucoma, and may potentially serve as a new
prognostic tool. If personalized therapy for glaucoma
can be employed based on an individual’s sensitivity
to glucocorticoids, the incidence of steroid-induced
glaucoma maybe significantly reduced. In addition, the
antagonist of GR may be a potential new therapy for
steroid-induced glaucoma, but the relevant mechanisms
will require further investigation. Alternatively, Agapove
et al [25], showed that an increased expression of NF-κB
and AR in glaucomatous ONH astrocytes suggested that
androgen plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
glaucoma, but the underlying mechanisms still need to be
confirmed.

various types of cytokines, immunoreceptors, adhesion
molecules and chemokines. Secretion of cytokines and
inflammatory mediators plays important roles in uveitis.
Studies have shown that the liver X receptor (LXR)
stimulants supressed the inflammatory response and
blocked the signal transduction of NF-κB signaling [26].
Some synthetic ligands, such as GW3965 and TO901317
(TO90), have shown greater efficacy and potency than
the endogenous ligand of LXRs, the oxysterol. Studies on
these ligands reveal some of the biological mechanisms
in the LXR family. TO90 treatment reduced the levels of
proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6,
IL-1β, MCP-1 and IL-17, and decreased the expressions
of the NF- κB subunit p65 at the mRNA and protein levels
in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune uveitis
(EAU) [27]. The role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of
uveitis by secretion of inflammatory cyotkines i.e. IL-17
was summarized by Luger et al [28]. In addition, Th17
cells induce uveitis by directly targeting tissue cells. TO90
treatment also inhibited the expression of Th17 in EAU,
which suggests that TO90 has the potential to become a
novel therapeutic agent for autoimmune uveitis (Figure 5).

NRs and Uveitis
Uveitis is an ocular disease that is most common in
adults. It carries a very complicated pathogenesis that can
be classified into many types. Most of the uveitis results
from the infections and disorders of the immune system.
When left untreated, it could progress to blindness.
Therefore, uveitis has attracted worldwide attention
because of its significant role in the cause of blindness.
The activation of NF-κB signaling induces the
expression of inflammation-related genes, including

NRs and retinopathy
NRs and age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
AMD is a debilitating medical condition,
accompanied by progressively impaired vision, and
severely affects the living quality of elderly people. AMD

is a major cause of blindness in the elderly in developed
countries. Feskanich et al. [29] demonstrated that the
decrease in endogenous levels of estrogen was associated
with the risk of AMD in early postmenopausal women, and
postmenopausal hormone therapy has a protective effect
against the progression of AMD. A prospective study from
the Netherlands showed that ERα are associated with the
progression of AMD in older women [30]. Another study
showed that 17β-Estradiol protects against oxidative
stress-induced cell damage in ARPE-19 cells by targeting
ERβ, and ERβ was found to be expressed in ARPE-19
cells, but not in the human RPE cells [31]. In addition,
the association between PPAR/RXR signaling pathway
and AMD has been gradually revealed, particularly since
PPARγ was found to participate in the maintenance of
lipid sensing, immunomodulation, and redox signaling,
all of which were related to the pathogenesis of AMD.
The isomers of PPAR/RXR have been found in human
macrophages, RPE cells, and endothelial cells. Although
the dysregulation of PPARγ has a limited effect on
AMD, PPARγ may play an important role in modulating
oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in AMD
[32]. Though genetic studies have not found a direct
association between heterodimers of LXRs/RXR and
AMD, it is hypothesized that heterodimers of LXRs/RXR

may function as complexed NRs in AMD. In addition,
LXRs can reverse cholesterol transport to avoid the overaccumulation of lipids and thus maintain the balance
between cholesterol and lipid acids, and these processes
are dysregulated in AMD [33]. Sene et al. [34] found
that intra vitreal delivery of LXR agonists restored the
cholesterol efflux and alleviated the severe sides effect of
photocoagulation-induced choroidal neovascularization
(CNV) in old mice. Malek et al. [35] summarized several
biological pathways that are potentially involved in the
development and progression of AMD in great detail.
Furthermore, the correlation between nuclear receptors
and the disease was introduced in the same review. They
believe that the role of nuclear receptors in the posterior
segment of the eye is promising. One of the top priorities
is to find the potential association of NR drug therapy with
AMD (Figure 6).
NRs and pigmentary retinal degeneration (PRD)
NR2E3, also called photoreceptor-specific nuclear
receptor (PNR), belongs to the eye organ receptor family
with its expression restricted to the photoreceptors
[36]. NR2E3 is postulated to maintain the survival,
development, and differentiation of Rods by interacting
with transcriptional factors, CRX and NRL [37].

Figure 7: ERRγ and RORα may be targets for treatment of ischemic retinopathies.

NR2E3 protein expression is located in the outer layer
of neurosensory retina. NR2E3 has a significant role in
the development and function of rod cells [38]. NR2E3
gene mutations resulted in the enhanced S-cone syndrome
(ESCS) which is manifested by the excess of blue
cones and a loss of rods, showing a gain of function of
photoreceptors [39-41], Goldmann-Favre syndrome (GFS)
[42], clumped pigmentary retinal degeneration (CPRD),
retinitis pigmentosa (RP) et al. with common clinical
features including night blindness and loss of functions
of rods [43].

ganglion cell line (RGC-5) increased the mRNA and
protein levels of ERRγ. This result indicated that ERRγ
could be a target in the treatment of ischemic retinopathies
[45]. Another study demonstrated that DNA-PK directly
phosphorylates NOR-1 and, therefore modulates SMC
proliferation, which contributes to the vascular remodeling
processes [46] (Figure 7).

NRs and ophthalmic tumors
The question of whether ER and PR are expressed
in conjunctival melanoma or uveal melanoma cells has
attracted a number of investigations. In 1995, Foss et al.
[47] proved that most of the conjunctival melanoma and
uveal melanoma cells had expressed heat-shock protein 27
(HSP27), but the expression of ER and PR were not found
in these melanoma cells. Therefore, Foss et al. concluded
that ER and PR hardly play any roles in the progression
of these melanomas. Studies from Grostern also found
no histological evidence for the presence of type I
estrogen receptors in choroidal melanoma [48]. Shown
by a tissue-array, Pache [49]revealed the expression
of PR, but not ER, in melanocytic lesions of the ocular
conjunctiva, and thePR expression increased with age. The
differences among these studies may be due to difference
in human races from which tissues were extracted and
the experimental methodologies employed. Fatty acid
synthase (FASN) has a higher expression in retinoblastoma
(RB) than that in normal cells, and is associated with

NRs and retinal neovascularization
Retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptor α
(RORα) is a member of the orphan nuclear family and it
has many biological functions including lipid metabolism
and inflammatory modulation. The expression of RORα
was substantially up-regulated in the oxygen-induced
proliferative retinopathy mouse model. However,
genetic deficiency of RORα significantly decreased
pathological retinal neovascularization. It was shown
that RORα directly suppressed the gene transcription of
suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which is an
important negative regulator of inflammation. SR1001,
a RORα inverse agonist, can effectively protect against
pathological neovascularization. These results demonstrate
that RORα inhibition can be used for the treatment of
ocular neovascularization [44]. It was found that hypoxic
conditions (1% O2) and desferrioxamine treatment in a

Figure 8: Fatty acid synthase (FASN) had a higher expression in retinoblastoma (RB) than that in normal cells, and
was associated with high invasive ability. The chemical inhibitor of FASN, cerulenin treatment resulted in altered expression levels
of many genes, including the down-regulation of PPARα and RXRα in RB.

high invasive ability. Studies also showed that treatment
with the chemical inhibitor of FASN, cerulenin, resulted
in altered expression levels of many genes, including
down-regulation of PPARα and RXRα in RB [50]. The
association between PPARα and RB may require further
study. The functions of retinoic acid were studied by
targeting its respective receptors on the ocular surface. It
was shown that retinoic acid improved the partial and full
thickness of corneal lacerations, as well as the defect of
corneal epithelia [51]. Immunohistochemical staining with
androgen receptor and adipophilin were used to separate
squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas, sebaceous
tumors, and basal cell carcinomas. Both squamous cell
carcinomas and melanomas showed negative staining
while basal cell carcinomas showed positive staining for
androgen receptor in a distant minority of cells. For the
intraepithelial (or pagetoid) spread, detection of androgen
receptor was more sensitive and reliable than adipophilin
[52]. Further study from Mulay et al. [53] concluded that
AR is useful in diagnosing sebaceous carcinoma and
differentiating it from SCC and BCC. Moreover, Kubota
et al. [54], showed that the primary ductal adenocarcinoma
of lacrimal gland specimens were positive for androgen
receptor, and negative for PR and ER. Vaso-proliferative
tumors of the retina (VPTRs) are a type of benign tumors
that is common in the peripheral retina in the elderly.
It can be spontaneous or secondary to other diseases of
the eye. Its main characteristics in clinic are peripheral
retinal vascular masses with obvious exudation [55].
Recent studies have found that a novel p.D406G mutation
in the NR2E3 gene is associated with VPTRs [56]. This
discovery is beneficial for disease diagnosis and would
potentially provide another form of therapy for the
affected patients (Figure 8).

abnormal expression of NRs can lead to a variety of ocular
pathogenesis. Continuous discovery of the relationship
between nuclear receptors and ocular diseases not only
has important significance in the study of the occurrence
and development of diseases, but also brings inspiration
for new drug development. It can make targeted therapy
become a reality, and individualized medicine possible.
At different stages of ocular diseases, there will be high
expressions of respective NRs, and we can establish
ocular disease animal models or in vitro cell experiments
to investigate the expression of NRs at these stages, and
subsequently develop respective agonists, inhibitors, coactivators, or co-repressors for the treatment of ocular
diseases. In addition, the expressions of relevant NRs will
be helpful for the diagnosis of ocular diseases. Therefore,
it is of great scientific interest to put more effort in the
study of NRs.

NR AND THERAPY
Endogenous or synthetic ligands that induce
activation or inhibition of the respective receptors to
regulate the expressions of targeting genes have been
extensively used for medical treatment [57]. For instance,
the selective AR antagonist, flutamide, has been used
for the treatment of prostate cancer; tamoxifen, which
partially antagonizes ER, has been used to treat breast
cancer; troglitazone indirectly activates PPARγ to reduce
blood glucose levels in patients with type II diabetes. It
has been reported that a third-generation drug discovery
effort has begun in the field of nuclear receptors for nonenzymatic therapeutic targets. It is believed that with the
increased understanding of NRs and ocular diseases, more
NR therapeutic drugs will be used in ophthalmology [58].
