The Prognostic Difference of
Monoallelic Versus Biallelic
Deletion of 13q in Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia
In a recent online paper on del13q14 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Garg at al1 state that neither
pattern of deletion (mono- versus biallelic) nor the percentage of deleted cells influences risk of progression.
Interestingly, in 12 patients who had a repeat fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, an increase
in the number of deleted cells was detected. In light of
these data, we reviewed our del13q14-CLL patients
who were monitored by FISH during their clinical
course. Between 2001 and 2009, del13q14 was identified as the sole abnormality in 137 of 352 CLL
patients (39%). Baseline FISH analysis was performed
at diagnosis or within 12 months (probes: LSID13S319 and LSI-Rb1, LSI-ATM, LSI-p53, CEP12;
Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill). D13S319 deletion was
monoallelic in 121 cases (88%) and biallelic in 16.
The median percentage of abnormal nuclei was 50%
(range, 15%-96%) and was higher in patients with a
biallelic pattern (73% vs 49%; P < .0001, MannWhitney test). With a median follow-up of 59 months
(range, 12-124 months), the 5-year treatment-free survival rate was 54% (Kaplan-Meier). As a continuous
variable, the baseline percentage of abnormal nuclei
was related to progression (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.04; P ¼ .0002;
Cox regression), whereas the pattern of deletion was
not significant. Repeat FISH analyses were performed
on 100 patients (median interval from baseline to
repeat FISH analysis, 36 months; range, 9-97 months).
A significant increase in the proportion of del13q14
cells was detected (P < .0001, Wilcoxon matched
pairs), and change in the percentage of deleted cells
per unit of time (1 month) significantly affected the
risk of treatment requirement (HR, 2.03; P ¼ .016;
95% CI, 2.03-3.6; Cox regression). Although del13q14
CLL carries a good prognosis, it is clinically and biologically heterogeneous. Although prognostic impact of
baseline FISH profile is controversial, our experience
confirms2,3 that the percentage of deleted cells at diagnosis represents an useful prognostic parameter. Additionally, we advise FISH monitoring for a dynamic
outcome estimate and to guide clinical surveillance.

Reply to The Prognostic
Difference of Monoallelic Versus
Biallelic Deletion of 13q in
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Orlandi et al report on 137 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and deletion 13q followed between 2001
and 2009, 16 of whom were biallelic. The median percentage of abnormal nuclei was higher in patients with a
biallelic pattern (73% vs 49%). We evaluated our patients
in light of this letter. Similarly to other pretreatment factors that we examined, we did not see any difference
between the 2 groups. The median number of abnormal
nuclei in the biallelic group was 32.5% (range, 7%78.5%) versus 34% (range, 8.5%-89.5%) in the monoallelic group. Orlandi et al also report that the baseline percentage of abnormal nuclei was related to progression. We
did report that the median percentage of 13q deletion was
higher in both groups for those subsequently requiring

treatment, but that it did not reach statistical significance.
Because the trend was the same in each of the groups, we
reexamined this by combining the data from all patients
(biallelic and monoallelic). The median number of abnormal nuclei was 44.5% (range, 8.5%-89.5%) in the 46
patients subsequently progressing. In the 130 patients
who had not required treatment, the median number of
baseline abnormal nuclei was 31.5% (range, 7%-85%; P
¼ .17). As reported in our paper, in the patients (n ¼ 12)
in whom fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed at the time of treatment, the median percentage of
positive cells had increased from 35% to 79%. We examined the data using the cutpoints described in the large series by Van Dyke et al.1 One hundred forty-seven patients
had 65.5% abnormal nuclei; 34 patients required treatment. Twelve of 29 patients having >65.5% abnormal
nuclei required treatment (P ¼ .041). The median time to
treatment in the group with <65.5% abnormal nuclei
was not reached versus 25 months (P ¼ .021) in the other
group. So although the median percentage of abnormal
nuclei did not differ, those with a markedly higher percentage of abnormal nuclei at baseline were more likely to
progress to treatment and progressed more quickly.
The decision to treat was made using standard
criteria and was irrespective of FISH results. Thus, it
is unclear what the benefit of frequent monitoring
would be, as this would not change the current
approach to therapy.

Nilotinib Versus Imatinib
Molecular Mechanism(s) of Its Better
Efficacy
Recently, several reports in Cancer focused on better
efficacy of nilotinib than imatinib for the treatment
of patients with Philadelphia-positive (Phþ) chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase.1,2
We would like to share our experience with
imatinib, which could clarify the molecular mechanism(s) of this finding, and to give guidance for
further improvement of therapeutic strategy. The
effectiveness of both pharmaceutics might be a matter
of dose and suppression of telomerase activity in
addition to suppression of bcr-abl (breakpoint cluster
region/v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene)
tyrosine kinase. These enzymes are the most powerful
key factors in the proliferation and immortalization of
cancer cells, and they might be involved with tight
cross-signaling.
In the chronic phase of CML, approximately
80% of the patients show reduced telomere length
without highly elevated telomerase activity or microsatellite alterations, and in most instances, the Philadelphia translocation is the sole chromosomal
anomaly.3 In contrast, in the blast phase of CML,
up to 80% of patients show additional cytogenetic
changes, resulting in genome instability, enhanced
telomerase activity, and telomere dynamics that relate
to karyotypic instability. The majority of these
patients are already receiving chemotherapy. It has
been observed that the telomerase activity has a high
prognostic impact in CML and its acceleration associates with shorter survival of the patients.3 It seems
that both abnormalities—bcr-abl fusion and telomerase activity—are equally essential for the outcome of
disease.
In terms of the effect of imatinib on the telomerase
activity and cell proliferation, we found that imatinib has
a dual effect on the proliferation of cultured Phþ cells,
derived from patients with CML in the chronic phase,
depending on the dose of medication (Fig. 1). In doses
above the threshold level, imatinib has an impressive inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, without influencing
telomerase activity. In doses below the threshold level,
imatinib has a very strong stimulating effect on cell

CML. The choice of medication dose and effective inhibition of this cross-signaling can be crucial for therapeutic strategy.

proliferation, which is accompanied with strong telomerase activation.
The inhibition of bcr-abl tyrosine kinase in Phþ
cells by imatinib has potential for indirect induction of
telomerase activity through regulation of telomeric-associated proteins, namely, overexpession of tankyrase and
down-regulation of telomeric repeat binding factor 1
(TRF1)-interacting nuclear factor 2 (Tinf2/TRF1).4
This leads to telomere lengthening and enhancement of
cell proliferation. It has been reported that an early strategy to overcome initial standard dose-resistance to imatinib is the use of high doses, which confirms our
hypothesis.5
Recently, Shapira and colleagues reported that
nilotinib is a telomerase inhibitor.6 Future confirmation of this single report would be of exceptional interest for clarifying the mechanism of cross-signaling
between bcr-abl tyrosine kinase and telomerase and its
participation in development of drug resistance in

toxicities, and prolongs progression-free survival.1
Recently, Bakalova et al2 speculated on the role of telomerase activity (TA) in CML and its relationship with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib and
nilotinib. They hypothesize that differential effects of
TKIs on TA play a role in the future use of TKIs in terms
of choice and dose.
To date, this assumption seems speculative because
any direct effect of TKIs on TA has never been demonstrated convincingly in vivo. Moreover, it remains controversial whether TA in CP CML is increased in breakpoint
cluster region/-Abelson oncogene (BCR-ABL)-positive
(BCR-ABLþ) hematopoietic stem cells specifically at all,
or simply reflects the increased cell cycle activity within
the CD34-positive leukemic compartment typically
assayed for TA.3 Furthermore, studies addressing effects
of TKIs on BCR-ABLþ cells provided controversial
results ranging from inhibition of TA to no effect whatsoever, and even to increased levels of TA observed under
treatment.4 In addition, as the authors point out, the
direct or indirect effects of TKIs on TA might also be dose
dependent.2
Nevertheless, the association of telomerase up-regulation with CP CML progression to accelerated phase
(AP) and/or blast crisis (BC) has been reported consistently.4 Furthermore, evidence has accumulated over the
last 15 years regarding the correlation of dysfunctional
telomeres with disease progression. Telomere length has
been demonstrated to be significantly shortened both
compared with age-adjusted controls as well as compared
with BCR-ABL T cells derived from the same patients.5
Accelerated telomere shortening has been correlated with
disease stage (ie, CP > AP/BC), Hasford risk score,
response to treatment, and (in patients with CP CML)
with the duration until disease progression to AP/BC.4,5
Based on these results, telomere length, at least in the context of intact cell cycle checkpoints, could represent a valuable prognostic and/or predictive biomarker for disease
progression, response to TKIs, and potentially for maintenance of response upon cessation of TKI treatment.6
These questions are being addressed prospectively as part
of a scientific subproject performed in patients with CP
CML who are undergoing nilotinib as front-line treatment (the ENEST1st study).

5182

In conclusion, increasing evidence points to a strong
direct or indirect interaction between BCR-ABL activity
and telomere maintenance in CML, which is most likely
mediated via effects on TA. Whether this phenomenon
could be used clinically as a predictive biomarker, and
even for selection of individual TKIs most suitable for
individual patients, remains to be demonstrated.
