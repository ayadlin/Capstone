ABSTRACT
Purpose: The prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is still dismal
despite recent improvements achieved by introducing new therapeutic agents.
However, there remains an urgent need for progress in myeloma drug development.
We here show that novel marine-derived compounds can exert potent anti-myeloma
activity.
Experimental Design: Nine marine-derived compounds were applied at low nM
concentrations (0.1-100 nM) to MM cell lines (OPM-2, NCI-H929, U266, RPMI-8226),
to primary human myeloma cells and to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Apoptosis
was determined by flow cytometry. In addition, eGFP-transgenic MM cell lines
growing with mesenchymal cells from bone marrow were used to visualize tumors
by fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Anti-myeloma activities were studied in vitro in
3D spheroids and in vivo in myeloma xenografts on chicken embryos. Tumor size was
analyzed by measuring GFP content with a GFP ELISA. Anti-angiogenic activities of
compounds were tested in an in vivo gelatin sponge assay with conditioned media
from primary bone marrow-derived endothelial cells.
Results: We identified a subset of marine compounds with strong anti-myeloma
activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, some of the compounds inhibited myelomarelated angiogenesis in the in vivo gelatin sponge assay. They merit further drug
development to improve treatment options for MM.

INTRODUCTION

improvement in overall and progression-free survival due
to the introduction of new drugs as proteasome inhibitors
like bortezomib and carfilzomib and immunomodulatory
agents including thalidomide, lenalidomide and
pomalidomide [4, 5], in most cases MM remains an
incurable disease with inevitable disease progression due
to clonal evolution, development of drug resistance and
fatal outcome [4].

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most
frequent hematological malignancy [1], a malignant B-cell
neoplasm with rising prevalence that causes considerable
morbidity, mortality and health care expenditures [2,
3]. Although the last decade has seen considerable

RESULTS

MM is a highly heterogeneous malignancy
characterized by complex primary and secondary
cytogenetic and molecular aberrations with varying
clinicopathological features and disease course [6, 7]. Due
to intraclonal and interclonal tidings MM cells constitute
a “moving therapeutic target” [8]. Therefore, new drugs
might supplement the current therapeutic armamentarium
by targeting putative driver genes and signaling pathways
in MM cells and affecting the myeloma stromal niche in
the bone marrow.
In this regard, the marine environment with its
large biodiversity constitutes a rich source of potential
therapeutic compounds. Systematic high-throughput
screening has identified the antitumor potential of a variety
of marine-derived compounds with significant biological
activities in vitro and in vivo. Several marine lead
compounds are currently under development as cancer
therapeutics. Plitidepsin (Aplidin), an anticancer agent
originally isolated from the tunicate Aplidium albicans
and currently obtained by total synthesis, is being tested
in a phase III trial in patients with relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma (registered with www.clinicaltrials.
gov, number NCT01102426). At the molecular level,
Plitidepsin is a potent inducer of apoptosis. This effect
has been related to its interaction with eEF1A and the
generation of early oxidative stress, which triggers the
sustained activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs [9] and
leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent
unfolded protein response (UPR) activation (Drug
Discovery Area, PharmaMar S.A.U., unpublished data).
In this study, we assayed a selected set of marine
substances with respect to anti-myeloma activities in vitro
and in vivo against standard anti-myeloma compounds,
such as bortezomib, and substances in advanced
development like Plitidepsin as reference.

Screening for compounds with anti-myeloma
activity using myeloma cell lines in vitro
Marine compounds were tested for their ability
to induce apoptosis in human MM cell lines. For this
purpose, cell viability was measured by flow cytometry
24h after incubation with increasing concentrations of
test compounds. Most compounds showed anti-myeloma
activity in vitro when tested at concentrations of 100 nM
in commercially available human MM cell lines growing
under standard culture conditions (Table 1, Supplementary
Figure 1). Plitidepsin, Zalypsis, PM00113, PM01215,
PM02781 and Thiocoraline A induced significant apoptosis
in all MM cell lines at 100 nM. A strongly dose-dependent
effect was seen with Zalypsis, PM00113 and Thiocoraline
A; these compounds were even effective at a concentration
of 10 nM in one or more cell lines inducing apoptosis
like the reference compound bortezomib. Notably, at
100 nM concentration compounds Plitidepsin, Zalypsis,
PM00113 and Thiocoraline A also induced apoptosis of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from five
healthy donors (Supplementary Figure 2A) comparable to
bortezomib 100 nM (apoptotic rate increased from 11.3 ±
3.2 in control cells to 28.0 ± 4.3% in bortezomib-treated
cells, data not shown).

activity using bone marrow aspirates of patients
with multiple myeloma
Anti-myeloma activity of the marine compounds
was examined in vitro in ten samples of primary human
multiple myeloma cells. Clinical data of all patients are

provided in Supplementary Table 1. Whole bone marrow,
containing MM cells, normal hematopoietic and stromal
cells of the microenvironment, was cultivated in vitro
and incubated with increasing concentrations of target
compounds. After 24h primary MM cells were identified
by expression of CD45low and CD38high in flow cytometry
with gating for viable myeloma cells (annexin-Vneg
/7AADneg). In contrast to commercially available MM
cell lines, primary patient MM cells cultivated in context
with the respective cells of their microenvironment
were remarkably more sensitive to applied drugs (Table
2, Supplementary Figure 3). In fact, most of the drugs
effectively induced apoptosis even at a concentration
of 10 nM. In detail, Plitidepsin, Zalypsis, PM00113
and Thiocoraline A applied at a concentration of 10 nM
showed significant anti-myeloma activity against primary
MM cells in vitro. PM01215 and PM02781 at 10 nM
demonstrated apoptotic activity only in individual
patients (Table 2) and thus were excluded from further
analysis. MM cells from one patient (MM#3, clinically
refractory to bortezomib, see Table 2) were not sensitive
to bortezomib at all, but were readily killed in vitro with
marine compounds. MM cells from patient MM#1 (newly
diagnosed MM), MM#5 (progressive disease with plasma
cell leukemia), MM#6 (progressive disease), MM#9
(progressive disease) and MM#10 (progressive disease),
all five considered high-risk patients, showed a significant
apoptosis response when treated with two to four of the
marine-derived compounds. All but one patient sample
(MM#7; high-risk myeloma, progressive disease) were
sensitive to marine-derived compounds. With regard

to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC, n=5)
all tested compounds displayed no significant apoptotic
effects at concentrations of 10 nM, as determined by
staining for annexin-Vneg /7AADneg and flow cytometric
analysis (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 2A).
Based on these findings made in primary MM
cell cultures, the four compounds Plitidepsin, Zalypsis,
PM00113 and Thiocoraline A, effective at 10 nM, were
used for further analysis in 3D in vitro and in vivo
assays of MM cells with the respective mesenchymal
microenvironment.

In vitro analysis of selected marine compounds in
3D in vitro multiple myeloma spheroid assays
Due to the limitations of culturing primary
human MM cells in vitro we established a 3D in vitro
culture model of human MM cell lines using a collagen
extracellular growth matrix and supportive primary
human mesenchymal cells from bone marrow. MM
cell lines transgenic for eGFP allow visualization and
quantification of MM tumor mass after 3D growth in
spheroids (Figure 1A). Both MM cell lines OPM-2eGFP
and RPMI-8226eGFP were cultivated for three days in the
presence of increasing concentrations (1-100 nM) of the
respective target compounds, and tumors were visualized
by GFP expression (Figure 1A). All target compounds
significantly inhibited MM growth at concentrations of 10
and 100 nM in OPM-2eGFP and RPMI-8226eGFP spheroids.
Tumor cell mass was quantified after spheroids

were homogenized and eGFP content was measured with
a GFP-ELISA (Figure 1B). With regard to the applied drug
molarity, Zalypsis and PM00113 were the most potent
inhibitors in OPM-2eGFP and RPMI-8226eGFP 3D spheroids,
reaching or even exceeding the anti-myeloma activity
of bortezomib. Noteworthy, in MM 3D spheroids none
of the marine drugs induced apoptosis in mesenchymal
cells, even at concentrations of 100 nM (data not shown).
These data confirm our analysis of apoptosis induction
in standard culture of primary human mesenchymal
cells derived from bone marrow and exposed to marine
compounds, which cells were significantly more resistant
to apoptosis than were MM cells (Supplementary Figure
2B).

EGFP-transgenic myeloma cells (OPM-2eGFP and
RPMI-8226eGFP) together with ex vivo-derived human
bone-marrow mesenchymal cells were embedded in
collagen type I as extracellular matrix component. Test
substances were applied topically at 1 nM concentration.
These “onplants” were grafted on the chorioallantoic
membrane of chicken embryos (using six replicates). After
five days, MM xenografts formed tumors that could be
visualized by eGFP expression (Figure 2A). Compared to
controls (0.1% DMSO), all analyzed target compounds
inhibited growth of MM cells in xenografts resulting
in less green-fluorescent MM tumor cell mass (Figure
2A). Single MM xenografts (n=6/group) were excised,
homogenized and thereafter measured by GFP ELISA.
All tested compounds significantly reduced myeloma cell

mass in a manner similar to that observed for bortezomib
(Figure 2B). Again Zalypsis and PM00113 were the most
potent inhibitors of myeloma growth in vivo, exceeding
even the anti-myeloma activity of bortezomib.
In addition, we observed that revascularization of
xenografts and microvessel sprouting adjacent to grafts
were significantly reduced by marine-derived compounds
(Figure 2A).

lines. The same set of marine-derived drugs proved to be
growth-inhibitory in human MM xenografts in vitro and
in vivo. Plitidepsin blocks cell proliferation by arresting
the cells in transition from G0/G1 to S phase and triggers
apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release and activating
caspase 9 and 3 [10]. In addition, it also exerts antiangiogenic activity by reducing the secretion of VEGF and
the expression of VEGF receptor-1 from MOLT-4 human
leukemia cells in vitro [11]. Currently, this compound
is undergoing clinical testing in a phase III trial for the
treatment of relapsed/refractory MM (registered with
www.clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01102426). Our 3D
in vitro co-culture data and in vivo xenograft data strongly
support the development of Plitidepsin as an anti-myeloma
drug.
Zalypsis is able to induce cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis by provoking double-strand DNA breaks [12].
The strong anti-myeloma effect of this agent has already
been described in MM cell lines resistant to standard
anti-myeloma treatment [12]. This drug has already been
suggested by Ocio and coworkers as one of the most
powerful agents that have been evaluated against multiple
myeloma [12]. Their findings were confirmed by our MM
model systems and extended by analysis of MM primary
cells. PM00113, an analog of Zalypsis, is considered to
have a similar mode of action, i.e. DNA-binding and
inducing double-strand breaks. This new marine-derived
compound showed potent anti-myeloma effects at low
nM concentrations in vitro on MM cell lines (10 nM) as
well as on primary human myeloma cells (10 nM) and
on GFP-transgenic myeloma-xenografts in vivo (1 nM).
Thus, further development of the Zalypsis analog for MM
is warranted.
Thiocoraline A is a marine-derived cytotoxic
antibiotic. This compound causes an arrest in G1 phase
and decreases the rate of S phase progression towards
G2/M phases due to DNA polymerase-α inhibition [13].
In our MM cell lines and primary MM cells, Thiocoraline
A showed potent inhibition of myeloma growth in a dosedependent manner.
For the purpose of future clinical drug development
we conducted a more detailed analysis of the four
marine agents effective against primary myeloma cells.
Primary bone marrow-derived myeloma cells from MM
patients even with high-risk cytogenetic features and
progressive disease were remarkably sensitive to marinederived compounds. As an example, although patient
#3 was refractory to treatment with dexamethasone and
bortezomib, myeloma cells from his bone-marrow were
resistant to bortezomib in vitro but were readily killed
by compounds Plitidepsin, Zalypsis and PM00113 even
at low nanomolar concentrations (10 nM), suggesting the
lack of cross-resistance between bortezomib and these
marine-derived substances.
Zalypsis and PM00113 were the most potent
inhibitors of myeloma growth, exceeding the anti-

Anti-angiogenic activities of target compounds in
vivo in the gelatin sponge assay
To investigate whether marine-derived compounds
could also inhibit myeloma-related angiogenesis, we
tested all compounds in the in vivo CAM assay. Sponges
soaked with conditioned medium of bone marrow-derived
endothelial cells from patients with MM were grafted with
compounds S1-S9 on chicken chorioallantoic membranes
(CAMs). CAMs implanted with a gelatin sponge together
with conditioned medium were surrounded by a rim of
newly formed capillaries converging radially toward the
sponge in a “spoked-wheel” pattern (mean number of
vessels: 24±6; Figure 3A; with serum-free medium: mean
number of vessels: 9±2). Marine-derived compounds
applied at low nM concentrations markedly inhibited
the formation of capillaries (Figure 3A). Addition of
compounds at even a concentration of 0.1 nM resulted
in a significant inhibition of MM endothelial cellinduced angiogenesis for Plitidepsin, Zalypsis, PM00113,
PM01215 and PM02781 (Figure 3B).

DISCUSSION
Recently, progression-free and overall survival rates
in MM patients have been substantially improved by novel
classes of therapeutics such as proteosome inhibitors and
immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs) [4, 5]. Nevertheless,
virtually all patients relapse and ultimately become
resistant to therapy. Thus, scanning for new anti-myeloma
drugs and development of combinatorial therapeutic
strategies are essential to further improve the outcome of
patients with MM. A rapidly growing field of interest is the
development of novel drugs that directly target myeloma
cells and/or modify the respective microenvironment of
MM cells in the bone marrow.
This study evaluated new marine-derived
compounds for their anti-myeloma activity in vitro and
in vivo including direct and indirect effects on myeloma
cells. A subset of a total of 9 compounds tested (Plitidepsin
[S1], Zalypsis [S5], PM00113 [S6] and Thiocoraline
A [S9]) demonstrated significant proapoptotic activity
in primary human myeloma cells even at 10 nM
concentrations, comparable to bortezomib as a standard. In
vitro primary human myeloma cells were more sensitive
to the substances than were established myeloma cell

myeloma activity of bortezomib. Since our experiments
showed no cross-resistance to bortezomib, synergies
of these marine-derived compounds with established
anti-MM drugs including bortezomib and IMIDs can be
expected and should be evaluated.
Apart from directly affecting myeloma cells, some
of the compounds (Plitidepsin, Zalypsis, PM00113) can
also modify the myeloma-associated microenvironment,
e.g. via the inhibition of myeloma cell-induced formation
of new blood vessels. In vivo experiments using the
CAM assay revealed significant suppression of myelomainduced neoangiogenesis close to xenografts and
diminished revascularization of xenografts following
exposure to marine agents, even at low concentrations
(0.1 nM).
Finally, to screen for drug toxicity in vitro we
analyzed the proapoptotic activity of marine-derived
compounds on normal blood mononuclear cells using
flow cytometry. All four compounds with significant
anti-myeloma activity in vivo also induced apoptosis of
PBMNC and bone marrow-mesenchymal cells in vitro,
but only at high drug concentrations (100 nM). We thus
conclude that the proapoptotic effects of selected marine
compounds are dose-dependent and limited to neoplastic
cells when these drugs are applied at drug concentrations
of 10 nM or less.
In conclusion, we identified a set of new marine
compounds with strong anti-myeloma activity in vitro and
in vivo, representing valid candidates for further preclinical
and clinical development in myeloma. Our data indicate
no cross-resistance of these drugs with bortezomib,
suggesting that they could be used in combination with
established anti-myeloma drugs.

Plitidepsin (Aplidin) [S1] is a depsipeptide
discovered in the tunicate Aplidium albicans [14].
Lamellarin D [S2] was initially isolated from a marine
mollusk of the Lamellaria sp. [15] and subsequently
identified from ascidians [16]. The synthetic antitumor
agent Elisidepsin [S3] is structurally related to Kahalalide
F, originally isolated from the Hawaiian marine mollusk
Elysia rufescens [17]. The compound ES-285 [S4]
was discovered in the sea mollusk Spisula polynyma
[17]. Zalypsis [S5] is a synthetic alkaloid, related to the
marine natural compound Jorumycin and the family
of Renieramycins originally obtained from pacific
mollusks and sponges [18, 19]. Zalypsis has been shown
to exert potent antimyeloma activity by inducing DNA
double-strand breaks [12]. PM00113 [S6], an analog of
Zalypsis, is suspected to have a mode of action similar
to that of tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. PM01215
[S7] and PM02781 [S8] are two novel synthetic
analogs of Plitidepsin. Thiocoraline A [S9], a cytotoxic
antibiotic, was originally isolated from the actinomycete
Micromonospora marina, found in southeast Africa
[20]. Chemical structures of all compounds are shown in
Supplementary Figure 4.

selected with 2 µg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen). Cell lines
expressing the green reporter eGFP after two weeks of
selection were named OPM-2eGFP and RPMI-8226eGFP.

Detection of cell viability by flow cytometry
PBMNC and MM cells (cell lines and CD38high /
CD45 primary myeloma cells) were seeded into nutrient
medium in 96-well plates (100,000 cells/ well). Marinederived drugs and bortezomib as reference substance
were applied at concentrations of 0.1-100 nM. Cells
were exposed to the various drugs for 24 hours in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. All experiments were
done in triplicate. Cell immunostaining was performed
with antibodies directed against human CD45 (labelFITC) and CD38 (label-PE) purchased from Miltenyi BD
Biosciences.
Cell viability was determined by annexin V APC

3D myeloma spheroid model
Transgenic MM cell lines (OPM-2eGFP and RPMI8226 ; 250,000 per spheroid) were mixed into the
collagen together with human mesenchymal stromal
cells (50,000 cells/ spheroid) or with the respective
concentrations of compounds (1-100 nM). Aliquots of
the collagen/cell mixture (30 µl) were distributed over a
paraffin film in a 12-well plate and allowed to polymerize
for 30 min at 37°C, generating so-called collagen
spheroids. Thereafter, spheroids were overlaid with
culture medium containing the respective concentrations
of compounds (1-100 nM) and cultivated for three days.
After 72 hours of incubation at 37%, the spheroids were
documented with the Olympus SZX10 stereomicroscope

Generation of eGFP-encoding lentiviruses

Multiple myeloma xenograft model using the
CAM assay

The GFPmut1 chromophore is available in a
codon-optimized version (eGFP) in the commercial
vector pCMS eGFP (Invitrogen). The eGFP open reading
frame with 3’ UTR and polyadenylation signal was
cloned by amplifying the fragment by means of KOD
polymerase (Novagen) and specific forward (eGFP-for: 5tgcaaaaagcttgccacaac) and reverse primers (5 eGFP-rev:
5- ATTGTCTCATGAGCGGATAC).
The resulting PCR product was ligated into
the pENTR11 Gateway vector (Invitrogen, Vienna,
Austria), predigested with Xmn-I and Eco RV (NEB)
and polished with Klenow. All amplified and purified
pENTR11 vectors were control-sequenced for correct
orientation and exclusion of incorporated mutations.
pENTR 11 vectors were site-specifically recombined
with the pLenti6-V5 DEST vector (Invitrogen) using the
Gateway LR Clonase II Pus Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen).
The resulting pLenti6 DEST vector with eGFP openreading frame was transformed and propagated in OneShot Stabl3 bacteria (Invitrogen). Lentiviruses were
produced in HEK293FT cells by transfecting cells with
the pDEST6 vectors and helper plasmid mix (ViraPower,
lentiviral support kit) using Lipofectamine 2000 (both
from Invitrogen). Lentiviral titers were determined

The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay is
an established in vivo model that enables the investigation
of tumor angiogenesis, metastasis and invasion without the
need to sacrifice mature animals [21, 22]. In brief, fertilized
white Leghorn chicken eggs (SPF eggs; each group n=5)
were purchased from Charles River and cultivated in an
egg incubator at 37°C and 70% humidity (Compact S84)
for three days. Thereafter, embryos were transferred to a
plastic dish and incubated “ex ovo” for further four days,
so that the CAM was able to develop. OPM-2eGFP and
RPMI-8226eGFP myeloma cells (2.5 x 105) were mixed with
rat-tail collagen and human bone-marrow mesenchymal
stromal cells (0.5 x 105) and the 1 nM of the respective
compounds. Collagen drops were placed on parafilm for
30 min to allow polymerization of the extracellular matrix
at 37°C. Then onplants were transferred to the CAM of
7-day-old chicken embryos. After five days of in vivo
growth, onplants were documented with the Olympus
SZX10 stereomicroscope (Olympus) equipped with an

Quantification of eGFP protein by ELISA

Financial support

MM spheroids or excised xenografts were
transferred to 0.5 ml RIPA Buffer (Sigma Aldrich) and
homogenized with an Ultra Turrax Homogenizer three
times for 5 sec each on ice. Thereafter, homogenate
underwent three freezing/thawing cycles in liquid nitrogen
and a 37°C water bath. After centrifugation supernatants
were diluted in assay buffer. GFP levels were measured
with GFP ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs) using biotinylated
anti-GFP antibodies according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

This work was supported by the European Union
Seventh Framework Program OPTATIO (FP7/2007- 2013)
under grant agreement n°278570 and was performed
in the framework of NS’s PhD program for Clinical
Cancer Research. JK was supported by the Competence
Center ONCOTYROL and funded within the scope
of the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent
Technologies. The COMET program is conducted by the
Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The gelatin sponge-chorioallantoic membrane
assay

MA and LFGF are employees of PharmaMar. All
other authors declare no conflict of interest.

Fertilized white Leghorn chicken eggs were
incubated at 37°C and constant humidity [23]. On day 3,
the shell was opened and 2 mL to 3 mL of albumen was
removed to detach the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
On day 8, the CAMs were implanted with 1-mm3 sterilized
gelatin sponges (Gelfoam Upjohn) loaded with serum-free
medium (SFM) alone (negative control) or CM of multiple
myeloma endothelial cells (isolated accordingly Vacca et
al. [24] alone (positive control) or with 0.1 nM of each
compound tested. The angiogenic response was evaluated
on day 12 as the number of vessels converging toward the
sponge at a magnification of 50X and photographed in ovo
(Olympus stereomicroscope).
