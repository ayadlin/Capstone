NKX6.1 functions as a metastatic suppressor through
epigenetic regulation of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition

The transcription factor NKX6.1 (NK6 homeobox 1) is important in the development of pancreatic β-cells and neurons. Although
recent publications show that NKX6.1 is hypermethylated and downregulated during tumorigenesis, the function of NKX6.1 in
carcinogenesis remains elusive. Here, we address the metastasis suppressor function of human NKX6.1 using cell, animal and
clinical analyses. Our data show that NKX6.1 represses tumor formation and metastatic ability both in vitro and in vivo.
Mechanistically, NKX6.1 suppresses cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). NKX6.1 directly
enhances the mRNA level of E-cadherin by recruiting BAF155 coactivator and represses that of vimentin and N-cadherin by
recruiting RBBP7 (retinoblastoma binding protein 7) corepressor. Clinical cancer tumors with metastasis show low NKX6.1 protein
expression coinciding with low E-cadherin and high vimentin expression. Our results demonstrate that NKX6.1 functions as an EMT
suppressor by interacting with different epigenetic modiﬁers, making it a potential novel therapeutic option.

INTRODUCTION
Nkx6.1 (NK6 homeobox 1), ﬁrst identiﬁed in Drosophila
pancreatic β-cells,1 encodes a homeobox domain-containing
protein that acts as a bifunctional transcription factor. NKX6.1
regulates insulin-secreting β-cell differentiation by binding
to and activating the promoter of its own gene while
simultaneously broadly repressing the activity of other genes,
such as insulin.2 In addition, numerous reports have demonstrated essential functions of NKX6.1 in regional patterning and
neuronal fate determination.3 Hypermethylation of the NKX6.1
gene promoter in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients
compared with controls has been veriﬁed.4 Moreover, hypermethylation of the NKX6.1 promoter is frequently detected in
cervical cancer cell lines and squamous cell carcinoma tissues
but not in normal cervical tissues.5 NKX6.1 has also been
identiﬁed as a potential biomarker in cervical cancer screens.6
Accumulating evidence, including our own research, has shown
that tumor suppressor gene inactivation is attributable to
promoter hypermethylation in many types of cancer cells.7–9
Nevertheless, the fundamental biological role of NKX6.1 in
carcinogenesis or cell metastasis remains elusive.
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been well
documented as a constitutive step in embryogenesis that is critical
for organ development and differentiation.10 The importance of
EMT in the pathogenesis of human diseases and cancers, through
its involvement in organ ﬁbrosis,11 therapeutic resistance12 and
metastatic dissemination,13 has been increasingly appreciated.
Growing evidence supports a complex multistep tumor metastasis
process that includes the detachment of tumor cells from the
basal membrane through EMT and proceeds to invasion,
intravasation, circulation into blood vessels, extravasation and

ultimately localization to a distant secondary organ to form a
metastasis.14 EMT in carcinoma cells is deﬁned as shedding of the
differentiated epithelial phenotype, including cell–cell adhesion,
apical–basal polarity and lack of motility, as well as transition to
mesenchymal characteristics, including motility, invasiveness,
resistance to apoptosis and, importantly, many features of
tumor-initiating cells.15 Therefore, this cellular biological program,
EMT, is an early and indispensable process for tumor cell
dissemination and progression.
During the transition, the loss of epithelial markers, such as
E-cadherin, or the acquisition of mesenchymal markers, such as
vimentin or N-cadherin, is considered a vital event. Several EMT
regulators, including SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB1 and TWIST, can repress
E-cadherin directly or indirectly.13,16 A set of EMT regulators
become expressed and functionally activated in response to
contextual oncogenic signaling cascades, such as hypoxia,17 and
signaling occurring through a number of intracellular pathways,
including transforming growth factor-β,18 Wnt,19 Notch,20
Hedgehog21 and epidermal growth factor receptor.22 Despite this
growing awareness of the molecular players involved, the details
of the mechanism that coordinately regulates epithelial genes and
mesenchymal genes under the EMT program in human cancer
remain poorly deﬁned.
Here, we present data demonstrating that NKX6.1 acts as a
metastasis suppressor in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we address
how NKX6.1 inhibits cancer invasion and metastasis. Our results
provide important evidence that NKX6.1 suppresses tumor
metastasis through the epigenetic regulation of EMT. These
ﬁndings suggest that NKX6.1 may serve as a potential therapeutic
target in aggressive tumors.

RESULTS
Ectopic expression of NKX6.1 suppresses the transformation and
invasive ability of cancer cells
Promoter hypermethylation of NKX6.1 has been reported in
cervical cancer cells but not in normal cervical cells.5 We ﬁrst
evaluated the protein expression of NKX6.1 in three cervical
cancer cell lines and in normal cervixes. NKX6.1 protein expression
was downregulated in cancer cell lines compared with normal
cervixes (Figure 1a). To investigate the biological function of
NKX6.1 in cancer cells in vitro, we stably overexpressed NKX6.1 in
HeLa cells and CaSki cells, both of which normally show
undetectable NKX6.1 expression (Figure 1b and Supplementary
Figure 1a). The overexpression of NKX6.1 did not signiﬁcantly
affect cell viability (Figure 1c), but it did strongly reduce the colony
formation ability, which indicates a suppressed cell transforming
ability (Figure 1d). The stable overexpression of NKX6.1 also
decreased the number of invading cells (Figure 1e). Representative images of anchorage-independent growth and invasion
assays are shown in Supplementary Figures 1b and 1c.
To further evaluate the suppressive effects of NKX6.1 on
tumorigenesis, we established an inducible expression system in
HeLa cells (termed HeLa-TR), in which NKX6.1 expression was
induced by treating the cells with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox).
Western blotting and quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR
(qRT–PCR) analyses conﬁrmed that Dox treatment increased the
NKX6.1 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2a and Supplementary
Figure 2a). We tested the effects of NKX6.1 overexpression on cell
viability, transformation and cell invasion after induction for
7 days. Although the viability of NKX6.1-overexpressing cells was
not signiﬁcantly different from that of the controls (Figure 2b),
NKX6.1 overexpression suppressed colony formation (Figure 2c
and Supplementary Figure 2b) and invasion (Figure 2d and
Supplementary Figure 2c). These data were consistent with the
results obtained using cells stably expressing NKX6.1 and
demonstrated that NKX6.1 reduces cell transformation and
invasive ability.
Knockdown of NKX6.1 enhances the transformation and invasive
ability of cancer cells
We next sought to evaluate whether the knockdown of NKX6.1
affects the malignant features of cancer cells. We infected SiHa
cervical cancer cells, which show moderate NKX6.1 expression
levels, with lentiviruses harboring two small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
targeting distinct coding sequences of NKX6.1 (shNKX6.1-1 and
shNKX6.1-2) or a control, nontargeting, shRNA (shCtrl). The two
NKX6.1-shRNA transfectants exhibited suppressed NKX6.1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with the
controls in SiHa cells (Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure 3a).
NKX6.1 knockdown did not affect cell viability in SiHa cells
(Figure 3b), but it did signiﬁcantly enhance the cell transformation
ability of SiHa cells (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 3b).
Inhibition of NKX6.1 also enhanced the invasiveness of SiHa cells
(Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure 3c). Furthermore, we also
knocked down NKX6.1 in the HPV-immortalized cervical epithelial
cells, Z172 cells,23 which normally show moderate NKX6.1
expression levels (Supplementary Figure 3d). NKX6.1 knockdown
did not affect cell viability in Z172 cells (Supplementary Figure 3e),
but it did signiﬁcantly enhance the invasiveness of Z172 cells
(Supplementary Figure 3f). Collectively, these results indicated
that the loss of NKX6.1 increases the transformation and invasion
abilities of cancer cells in vitro.
NKX6.1 suppresses tumorigenicity and metastasis in xenograft
models
To explore the effect of NKX6.1 on tumorigenicity in vivo, we
subcutaneously injected 106 HeLa or CaSki cells expressing NKX6.1

or their corresponding controls into both ﬂanks of NOD-SCID
(non-obese diabetic severe-combined immunodeﬁciency) mice.
The tumor growth rate was slower and the tumor mass was
smaller with NKX6.1-expressing HeLa or CaSki cells compared with
the corresponding controls (Figures 4a and b).
To further investigate the role of NKX6.1 in metastasis, we
injected NKX6.1-expressing cells and their corresponding controls
or NKX6.1 knockdown SiHa cells and their corresponding controls
into mice via the tail vein. Two months after injection, there were
fewer metastatic lung nodules and no brain metastases in the
NKX6.1-expressing HeLa or CaSki cells compared with that in the
controls (Figures 4c–f). In contrast, there were more metastatic
lung nodules in NKX6.1 knockdown SiHa cells compared with that
in the controls (Supplementary Figures 4a and c). Taken together,
these data demonstrated that NKX6.1 has a critical role in
suppressing tumor formation and metastatic behavior in xenograft models.
NKX6.1 represses cancer invasion by regulating EMT
Furthermore, we sought to determine how NKX6.1 inhibits cancer
invasion and metastasis. Our preliminary results showed that
NKX6.1 overexpression enhanced E-cadherin expression and
repressed vimentin expression. NKX6.1-expressing HeLa cells
exhibited a more epithelial-like phenotype compared with the
control cells, which displayed ﬁbroblast-like mesenchymal features
(Figure 5a). EMT in carcinoma cells is deﬁned as a shedding of the
differentiated epithelial phenotype and the transition to mesenchymal characteristics.10 We ﬁrst analyzed the expression of SNAIL,
TWIST and SLUG to assess the effect of NKX6.1 on EMT regulators.
The ectopic expression of NKX6.1 did not signiﬁcantly affect the
expression of SNAIL, TWIST and SLUG in HeLa cells (Figure 5b), but
it did increase E-cadherin at both the transcriptional and protein
levels in HeLa or CaSki cells (Figure 5c). Moreover, knockdown of
NKX6.1 in SiHa cells decreased E-cadherin expression at the mRNA
and protein levels (Figure 5c). A similar regulation of E-cadherin
expression by NKX6.1 was observed in CaSki cells using
immunoﬂuorescence (IF) (Figure 5d). These results showed that
NKX6.1 regulates E-cadherin at the transcriptional level.
In support of this ﬁnding, a putative NKX6.1 homeodomainbinding site (designated HDBS)2,24 has been identiﬁed at position
− 1276 bp relative to the transcription start site of the E-cadherin
locus. On the basis of this information, we hypothesized that
NKX6.1 directly regulates E-cadherin transcription. Using
promoter-luciferase reporter assays, we showed that the overexpression of NKX6.1 enhanced E-cadherin promoter activity in a
dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mutation of the HDBS25 in
the E-cadherin promoter abolished the observed activation by
NKX6.1 (Figure 5e). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
revealed that a wild-type (WT) HDBS containing the E-cadherin
oligonucleotide probe interacted with NKX6.1-containing nuclear
extracts and that this interaction was abolished by the addition of
excess unlabeled competitor in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure
5a). In contrast, an HDBS E-cadherin probe containing a mutated
NKX6.1 HDBS was unable to interact with NKX6.1-containing
nuclear extracts (Supplementary Figure 5a, lane 6).
To conﬁrm that NKX6.1 binds to the endogenous E-cadherin
promoter, we performed quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) analyses. Our data demonstrated that NKX6.1
directly binds to the HDBS within the E-cadherin promoter.
Notably, this binding was accompanied by an increase in H3K9
acetylation, a marker of transcriptionally active chromatin, in
NKX6.1-expressing HeLa and CaSki cells, and this binding was
accompanied by a decrease in H3K9 acetylation in NKX6.1
knockdown SiHa cells (Figure 5f and Supplementary Figures 5b
and c). Thus, our data conﬁrmed that NKX6.1 directly binds to the
E-cadherin promoter through the HDBS. To further examine if
E-cadherin mediates NKX6.1-induced suppression of the invasive

property, we silenced E-cadherin expression using two shRNAs
(Supplementary Figure 5d) and found that E-cadherin knockdown
restores invasiveness in NKX6.1-overexpressing HeLa (Figure 5g
and Supplementary Figure 5e) and CaSki (Supplementary Figure
5f) cells. These data indicated that NKX6.1 suppresses cancer
invasion by directly binding to the E-cadherin promoter and
activating its expression.
The gain of mesenchymal markers is another hallmark of the
EMT process. Thus, we next sought to determine whether
vimentin or N-cadherin is involved in the NKX6.1-mediated
suppression of cell invasion. In contrast to the effects of NKX6.1
overexpression on E-cadherin, the overexpression of NKX6.1 in
either HeLa or CaSki cells induced a decrease in the vimentin and
N-cadherin mRNA and protein levels that was similar in both cell
lines, as shown by qRT–PCR, western blotting and IF assays
(Figures 6a and b and Supplementary Figure 6a). Conversely,
knockdown of NKX6.1 in SiHa cells enhanced vimentin expression
at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6a). A putative
NKX6.1 HDBS in the proximal promoter of the vimentin gene was
detected at position − 315 bp relative to the transcription start
site. The overexpression of NKX6.1 decreased vimentin promoter
activity, and site-directed mutagenesis of the putative HDBS
within the vimentin promoter prevented this repression in HeLa
cells (Figure 6c). EMSAs further showed that a WT HDBScontaining vimentin oligonucleotide probe interacted with
NKX6.1-containing nuclear extracts and that this interaction was
abolished by the addition of excess unlabeled competitor in
HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure 6b). In contrast, a vimentin
probe containing a mutated NKX6.1 HDBS was unable to interact
with these NKX6.1-containing nuclear extracts (Supplementary
Figure 6b, lane 5).
Subsequent qChIP assays revealed that NKX6.1 overexpression
in HeLa and CaSki cells increased the binding of NKX6.1 to the
© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited

HDBS within the endogenous vimentin locus in association with an
increase in the levels of H3K27me3, a marker of transcriptionally
inactive chromatin. Conversely, knockdown of NKX6.1 in SiHa cells
attenuated NKX6.1 binding and reduced the H3K27me3 levels
(Figure 6d and Supplementary Figures 6c and d). A similar effect of
NKX6.1 directly binding to the N-cadherin promoter through an
HDBS (position − 1835 bp relative to the transcription start site of
the N-cadherin locus) was observed by qChIP assays in SiHa cells
(Supplementary Figure 6e). Notably, the overexpression of
vimentin or N-cadherin in NKX6.1-expressing HeLa and CaSki
cells reversed the conversion to a mesenchymal phenotype
(Figure 6e and Supplementary Figures 6f and h). Collectively, these
data indicated that the mesenchymal genes, vimentin and
N-cadherin, are both direct targets of NKX6.1, and these data
suggested that decreases in the expression of these genes
contribute to the suppressive effect of NKX6.1 on cancer invasion.
NKX6.1 suppresses EMT by interacting with the BAF155
(coactivator) and RBBP7 (corepressor) epigenetic modiﬁers
To test our hypothesis that NKX6.1 may interact with different
cofactors to function as an activator or repressor involved in EMT
regulation, we identiﬁed NKX6.1 interaction partners. First, we
used an anti-V5 agarose afﬁnity gel to pull down NKX6.1associated proteins in V5-tagged NKX6.1-expressing HeLa cells
and then performed liquid chromatography coupled with tandem
mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure 7a). A gene ontology
analysis of candidate proteins using PANTHER (http://www.
pantherdb.org/)26 showed that many of these proteins are
involved in binding ability (Supplementary Figure 7b, left) with a
portion of the subcategory being related to chromatin binding
(Supplementary Figure 7b, right). These proteins included two
chromatin modiﬁers as follows: SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily c,

member 1 (SMARCC1 or BAF155) and retinoblastoma binding
protein 7 (RBBP7).
BAF155 is a member of the SWI/SNF family, and members of
this family display ATPase activities and are thought to regulate
the transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin
structure around those genes.27 RBBP7 is a ubiquitously expressed
nuclear protein that belongs to the polycomb repressive complex
2 and possesses HMT activity with speciﬁcity for Lys 9 (K9) and Lys
27 (K27) of histone H3.28 Because we were interested in the
epigenetic mechanisms connected to NKX6.1, we further validated
that NKX6.1 interacts with BAF155 or RBBP7 by using the V5
antibody to pull down endogenous BAF155 or RBBP7 in V5-tagged
NKX6.1-expressing HeLa cells in coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP)
assays (Figure 7a). Moreover, using an anti-FLAG antibody to pull
down exogenous NKX6.1 in HeLa cells coexpressing FLAGtagged BAF155 or RBBP7 and V5-tagged NKX6.1, we revealed
the association of NKX6.1/BAF155 or NKX6.1/RBBP7, respectively
(Supplementary Figures 7c and d). We also veriﬁed the interaction
of NKX6.1 with BAF155 or RBBP7 at the endogenous level in SiHa
cells (Figure 7b). Interestingly, the co-IP data showed that BAF155
and RBBP7 were mutually exclusive (Figure 7c). To determine
whether the observed inﬂuence of BAF155 or RBBP7 on the
Oncogene (2016) 2266 – 2278

transcriptional activity of NKX6.1 depends on its activation or
repression domain, V5-tagged NKX6.1 full-length (FL)1 and two
truncated NKX6.1 constructs, namely NKX6.1 (amino acids (aa) 1–
295; lacking activation domain) and NKX6.1 (aa 236–367; lacking
repression domain), were generated and expressed in HeLa cells
(Supplementary Figure 7e). Depletion of BAF155 or overexpression
of NKX6.1 (aa 1–295) reversed the E-cadherin promoter activity
enhanced by the overexpression of NKX6.1. As expected,
depletion of BAF155 and overexpression of NKX6.1 (aa 1–295)
together showed a stronger suppressive effect on E-cadherin
promoter activity in HeLa cells (Figure 7d). In contrast, the
depletion of RBBP7 did not affect promoter activity
(Supplementary Figure 7f, left). In addition, knockdown of RBBP7
or overexpression of NKX6.1 (aa 236–367) rescued the vimentin
promoter activity repressed by NKX6.1 overexpression. Both
knockdown of RBBP7 and overexpression of NKX6.1 (aa 236–
367) had strong effects (Figure 7e), whereas knockdown of
BAF155 did not alter promoter activity in HeLa cells
(Supplementary Figure 7f, right).
When we functionally analyzed the NKX6.1 interaction
with BAF155 or RBBP7, we found that knockdown of BAF155 or
RBBP7 rescued the invasive ability repressed by NKX6.1

overexpression in HeLa cells (Figure 7f and Supplementary Figure
7g). Subsequently, we performed ChIP assays using an antibody
speciﬁc for BAF155 and found a reduction in BAF155 binding to
the HDBS within the E-cadherin promoter in NKX6.1 knockdown
SiHa cells, and this reduction was accompanied by a decrease in
the H3K9 acetylation level. Importantly, RBBP7 did not bind to the
HDBS within the E-cadherin promoter (Figure 7g). Moreover, we
also found that a reduction in RBBP7 binding to the HDBS within
the vimentin promoter in NKX6.1 knockdown SiHa cells was
accompanied by a decrease in the H3K27me3 level. Notably,
BAF155 did not bind to the HDBS within the vimentin promoter
(Figure 7h). The ChIP data showed that BAF155 and RBBP7 are
mutually exclusive binding patterns. However, the loss of binding
was not because of a decrease in BAF155 or RBBP7 expression in
the NKX6.1 knockdown SiHa cells (Supplementary Figure 7h).
These data indicated that NKX6.1 may interact with the BAF155
coactivator to function as an activator and that NKX6.1 may
interact with the RBBP7 corepressor to function as a repressor in
the regulation of EMT-related markers.
Clinical correlation of NKX6.1 and E-cadherin or vimentin
expression
To assess the correlation of NKX6.1 and E-cadherin or vimentin
expression in cancer specimens, we performed immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays of cervical cancer samples
representing various stages of cancer. Immunohistochemical
staining showed that NKX6.1 was expressed at low levels in
normal epithelium, and the expression of NKX6.1 gradually
increased from normal squamous epithelium to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1, CIN2 and CIN3/CIS (carcinoma in situ)
but decreased in microinvasive and metastatic lesions (Figures 8a
and b and Supplementary Figure 8). These ﬁndings indicated a
strong correlation between the loss of NKX6.1 expression and
metastasis in cancer patients.
E-cadherin was more weakly expressed in microinvasive and
metastatic lesions compared with that in the CIN group, whereas
vimentin had much higher expression levels in cases of malignant
lesions compared with that in the CIN group (Figures 8a and b and
Supplementary Figure 8). Compared with NKX6.1 expression in
cervical cancer patients, NKX6.1 high expression cases showed
signiﬁcantly higher E-cadherin expression (47.8%) compared with
NKX6.1 low expression cases (15.7%; P o0.001) (Supplementary
Table 1), revealing a positive correlation. In contrast, NKX6.1 low
expression cases showed higher vimentin expression (23.2%)
compared with that in cases with NKX6.1 high expression (13%;
P = 0.05) (Supplementary Table 2), displaying a negative correlation. These clinical data suggested that NKX6.1 enhances
E-cadherin expression and represses vimentin expression to
inhibit cancer cell metastatic behavior.
DISCUSSION
Mammalian NKX6.1 is a transcription factor that has an important
role in pancreatic and neural development by regulating downstream targets. However, whether NKX6.1 is important in cancer
and EMT-related processes has not been reported previously.
Here, we provided evidence from cervical cancer cells, animal
samples and clinical samples that showed that NKX6.1 is a bona
ﬁde metastasis suppressor that regulates EMT. Taking our ﬁndings
together, we demonstrated that NKX6.1 activates epithelial gene
expression and represses mesenchymal gene expression at the
transcriptional level by interacting with different cofactors, namely
BAF155 and RBBP7. A proposed model of NKX6.1-suppressed EMT
based on our ﬁndings is presented in Figure 8c.
Our tissue microarray results showed that NKX6.1 expression is
higher in precancerous lesions compared with that in normal
epithelium. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased NKX6.1

expression in the early stages of tumor development may reﬂect a
response to oncogenic signaling stress, similar to that of LMX1A, in
cervical cancer.7,29 Speciﬁcity protein 1 (Sp1) belongs to the
Kruppel-like family of transcription factors, which bind to GC-rich
promoter elements and contribute to tumorigenesis by regulating
gene transcription related to proliferation or metastasis, and Sp1
protein expression is similar to that of the NKX6.1 protein in the
development of squamous cell carcinoma.30 Moreover, Sp1
downregulation caused by protein instability leads to the loss of
the transcriptional activation of E-cadherin, and consequently
increases the amount of nuclear β-catenin for gene transcription
related to metastasis in highly invasive lung tumor cells.31 Our
preliminary data showed that Sp1 can enhance NKX6.1 promoter
activity (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that
Sp1 may be an activator of NKX6.1 in the early stages of tumor
development.
It has been reported that the direct binding of NKX6.1 to DNA
via its NH2-terminal domain is involved in Groucho-mediated
transcriptional repression during neural patterning in the ventral
neural tube and in pancreatic β-cell differentiation.2,32 Moreover,
NKX6.1 is capable of activating NKX6.1 gene transcription through
interactions involving its COOH-terminal acidic domain. Nkx6.1
has been shown to mediate this feedback activation by recruiting
transcription factor IIB and transcription factor IID to its promoter.2
Drosophila Nkx6.1 has also been reported to both activate and
repress downstream target gene expression in the appropriate
context.33 Taken together, these data suggest that Nkx6.1 likely
has a bifunctional role in embryos and during β-cell differentiation. Our data showed that NKX6.1 functions as a bifunctional
transcription factor in suppressing the EMT process in cancer cells
by reciprocally modulating the expression of the epithelial marker,
E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal marker, vimentin. In addition,
our ChIP assays showed higher levels of K9-acetylated histone H3,
a marker of transcriptionally active chromatin, at the E-cadherin
promoter in NKX6.1-overexpressing cells compared with the levels
observed in control cells (Figure 5f). Conversely, we found that the
levels of K27-trimethylated histone H3, a marker of transcriptionally silent chromatin, were clearly higher at the vimentin promoter
in NKX6.1-overexpressing cells compared with that in control cells
(Figure 6d). These results suggested that EMT-related markers are
modulated by NKX6.1 in a context-dependent manner and that
NKX6.1 interacts with different modiﬁers of histone and chromatin
by associating with either the repression domain or the activation
domain of NKX6.1.
Several transcription factors have been known to function as
both a repressor and an activator by interacting with different
cofactors, such as nuclear receptors.34 To clarify this phenomenon,
we selected two chromatin-remodeling cofactors, namely BAF155
and RBBP7, as potential candidates based on our liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry data.
BAF155 contributes to the transcriptional activation of the nuclear
glucocorticoid receptor target,35 and the re-expression of BAF155
in ovarian and colon cancer cell lines leads to reduced
transformation ability, which implies that it is a tumor suppressor
gene.36 Additionally, TWIST has been reported to suppress
E-cadherin by interacting with several components of the
nucleosome remodeling complex, including RBBP7, and recruiting
them to proximal regions of the E-cadherin promoter for
transcriptional repression.37 However, the functional interaction
of NKX6.1 and BAF155 or RBBP7 in the regulation of EMT remains
unclear.
As expected, we demonstrated that NKX6.1 directly activates
E-cadherin by interacting with the BAF155 coactivator, and this
activation is accompanied by an increase in H3K9 acetylation
levels. Simultaneously, NKX6.1 directly represses vimentin by
interacting with the RBBP7 corepressor, and this repression is
accompanied by an increase in the H3K27me3 levels. Some EMT
regulators, such as SNAIL, also mediate their repression function

NKX6.1 suppresses metastasis by inhibiting EMT
H-J Li et al

2275
reported to bind to the E-cadherin promoter by physically
interacting with the BMI1 (polycomb repressive complex 1
subunit) and EZH2 (polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit)
chromatin-modifying factors and forming a repressive complex in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.43 Such chromatin
changes are concordant with a programmed epigenetic switch
related to EMT.44 Collectively, these studies indicate that histone
modiﬁers are required for the bifunctional properties of NKX6.1.
The current study demonstrated that NKX6.1 functions as an
EMT suppressor, thereby suppressing the metastatic behavior of
cancer cells. Considered together, our ﬁndings suggest a
therapeutic strategy for suppressing EMT based on re-expressing
NKX6.1 or the use of epigenetic drugs. Thus, our results shed light
on potential future therapeutic approaches for changing this
phenotype, which is relevant to cancer metastasis.

Figure 8. Clinical correlation of NKX6.1 and E-cadherin or vimentin expression. (a) Representative results for NKX6.1 (upper), E-cadherin
(middle) and vimentin (lower) immunohistochemical staining in samples representing a full spectrum of cervical cancer. Scale bar = 200 μm.
(b) Immunohistochemical staining data are expressed as the area percentage of positive staining of NKX6.1, E-cadherin and vimentin. The
median for each group is indicated by a horizontal bar (*Po 0.05, **Po0.01 and ***Po 0.001, Mann–Whitney U-test). The details of grading
are described in the Materials and methods section. (c) A proposed model of NKX6.1-suppressed EMT. NKX6.1 can bind to the promoter
of E-cadherin and functions as an activator via its activating domain to interact with the coactivator BAF155. NKX6.1 also binds to the promoter
of vimentin and functions as a repressor via its repression domain to interact with corepressor RBBP7. NKX6.1 is a bifunctional transcription
factor in EMT regulation. A, activation domain; HD, homeodomain; R, repression domain.
