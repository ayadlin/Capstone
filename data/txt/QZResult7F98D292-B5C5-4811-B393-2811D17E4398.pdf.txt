Abstract
Proteins of the BCL-2 family control the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
Targeting these proteins proves to be an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy.
The biological context is based on the fact that BH3-only members of the family are
specific antagonists of prosurvival members. This prompted the identification of “BH3
mimetic” compounds. These small peptides or organic molecules indeed mimic the
BH3 domain of BH3-only proteins: by selectively binding and antagonizing prosurvival
proteins, they can induce apoptosis in malignant cells. Some small-molecule inhibitors
of prosurvival proteins have already entered clinical trials in cancer patients and
two of them have shown significant therapeutic effects. The latest developments
in the field of targeting BCL-2 family proteins highlight several new antagonists
of prosurvival proteins as well as direct activators of proapoptotic proteins. These
compounds open up novel prospects for the development of BH3 mimetic anticancer
drugs.

INTRODUCTION

form. All prosurvivals can bind BAX whereas only BCLXL and MCL-1 bind to BAK. This antiapoptotic activity
is antagonized by the BH3-only members: by inserting
their helical BH3 region into the hydrophobic groove of
the prosurvival proteins, they provoke the release of the
sequestered BAX and BAK that are thus activated. These
interactions are selective: for example NOXA binds only
to MCL-1 and A1, BAD binds only to BCL-2, BCL-XL
and BCL-W, whereas BIM, BID and PUMA can bind to
all prosurvival proteins [1, 2]. Certain BH3-only proteins
(such as BIM, BID and probably PUMA) can directly
activate the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK.
Hence, the BCL-2 family proteins govern the
MOMP by their specific interactions, and thus the fate of
cells to either live or die. Targeting these proteins therefore
appeared as an attractive apoptosis-based strategy to assist
anticancer therapy [1, 2]. A particular attention has been
focused on the development of agents capable of inhibiting
the activity of prosurvival BCL-2 family members that are
overexpressed in various malignancies [1, 2, 4]. This has
led to the characterization of small molecules mimicking
the BH3 domain of BH3-only proteins, likely to selectively
bind to and antagonize prosurvival family members and
thus induce apoptosis. These “BH3 mimetic” compounds
are short peptides modeled on BH3 domains and small

Apoptosis is a cell death program intended for
regulating cell number during development and tissue
homeostasis as well as eliminating damaged/dangerous
cells [1]. Evasion of apoptosis is typical of many cancers
and a frequent cause of therapeutic resistance [2, 3]. This
evasion is mostly due to impairment in the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis. Proteins of the BCL-2 family strictly
control this pathway by inducing the mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The latter indeed
allows the release of apoptogenic factors responsible for
the activation of caspases that are the executioners of the
cellular demolition program [1, 2].
The BCL-2 family proteins are characterized by
their domains of homology to BCL-2 (BH1 to 4) and
their functional activities. They comprise the prosurvival
members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1 and A1)
and the proapoptotic members. The latter include the
MOMP effectors (mainly BAX and BAK) and the BH3only proteins, so-called because they have only the
BH3 domain (e.g., BIM, BID, PUMA, BAD, NOXA).
The activity of the prosurvival proteins is to bind to
proapoptotic molecules, notably the MOMP effectors
BAX and BAK which are thus sequestered in an inactive

organic molecules. The latter are identified by screening
libraries of either natural products or computer-designed
molecules for binding to BCL-2 proteins [5-16]. Two
major criteria were proposed by Lessene et al to define an
authentic BH3 mimetic: high affinity binding to the targets
(in the nM range) and induction of BAX/BAK-dependent
apoptosis [5]. Some compounds have shown significant
therapeutic effects in cancer patients.
The preclinical and clinical properties of the small
molecules inhibiting prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins
have been extensively reviewed [5-16]. Two of the most
recent reviews have described the biological context
to targeting these proteins and advances in therapeutic
approaches with BH3 mimetics. In the one, Anderson
et al have focused on the four agents that are in clinical
evaluation, discussed the data in detail and pinpointed
questions yet to be resolved for using these agents as part
of combination therapy [15]. In the other, Roy et al have
presented a comprehensive review of compounds that
target the BCL-2 family-driven pathway [16]. The present
article updates the small molecules targeting proteins of
the BCL-2 family with the discovery of not only highly
potent antagonists of prosurvival members but also direct
activators of the MOMP effectors BAX and BAK and a
dual prosurvival inhibitor/proapoptotic activator. These
data bring a new dimension to the therapeutic targeting of
BCL-2 family proteins.

97C1) and BI-97D6 were characterized in preclinical
studies as exhibiting higher binding affinities (in the
sub-µM range) and triggering predominantly BAX/
BAK-dependent apoptosis; both sabutoclax and BI-97D6
show in vivo antitumor effects in animal models [24, 25].
Interestingly, sabutoclax has turned out to be a pan-BCL-2
inhibitor in some but not all cellular systems, displaying
its best activity in inhibiting MCL-1 [26].
TW-37, a rationally designed benzoylsulphonyl
analog of gossypol [22, 27], was also known to operate
only in part as a pan-BH3 mimetic: it binds to BCL-2,
BCL-XL and MCL-1 with moderate affinity (sub-µM),
induces apoptosis depending partially on BAX/BAK
activation and shows several off-target effects. However,
a recent careful analysis has demonstrated that TW-37 (i)
induces several typical features of mitochondrial apoptosis
in MCL-1-dependent cells [but not BCL-2 or BCL-XLdependent cells] and (ii) exhibits all the hallmarks of a
NOXA-like BH3 mimetic antagonizing selectively MCL1, although only at high concentrations [26]. This study
suggested that derivatives of TW-37 with higher affinity
for MCL-1 might be developed [26].
ABT-737 and navitoclax
The fragment-screening approach based on
structure/activity relationship (SAR) by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) - initially described by Fesik and
colleagues [28] - led to the discovery of ABT-737, a
molecule with an acylsulfonamide moiety [29]. Its
orally-bioavailable derivative ABT-263 (now navitoclax)
was designed for clinical use [30]. Both molecules are
authentic BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2, BCL-XL and
BCL-W but not MCL-1 or A1 (as the BH3-only protein
BAD, so they are referred to as BAD-like BH3 mimetics).
They were extensively characterized in preclinical studies
[5, 16, 23]. The therapeutic activity of navitoclax in
patients with hematologic malignancies (particularly
chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and some solid cancers is
now well established [15, 16].

INHIBITORS OF PROSURVIVAL BCL-2
PROTEINS
Small organic molecules
Obatoclax
This synthetic indol bipyrrole molecule derived
from the natural product prodigiosin is capable of binding
to all prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins with low affinity
(in the µM range) and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells
in vitro [17]. This putative pan-BH3 mimetic (or BIMlike BH3 mimetic) was the first to enter clinical trials but
has shown only modest therapeutic effects [15, 18]. It is
now known that obatoclax does not meet the two main
criteria defining an authentic BH3 mimetic and that its
proapoptotic activities result from off-target mechanisms
[19, 20].

ABT-199
Thrombocytopenia (i.e., an abnormal decrease
in number of platelets in the blood) is a dose-limiting
effect of navitoclax due to the inhibition of BCL-XL (a
survival factor for platelets). To circumvent this side
effect, navitoclax derivatives that bind specifically
to BCL-2 (without significant binding to BCL-XL or
BCL-W) were designed, leading to ABT-199. This
true BH3 mimetic is the first highly selective inhibitor
of BCL-2 [31]. Initial clinical studies of ABT-199 in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma have already shown impressive antitumor
efficacy, with higher response rates than navitoclax and
without thrombocytopenia [15, 16, 31]. The latest results
from the trial in refractory or relapsed CLL patients have
confirmed the effectiveness of ABT-199: 23% of the 78
patients recruited for 2 years had complete response (with

Gossypol family
Gossypol, a natural polyphenol, and its synthetic
isomer AT-101 [21, 22] are also putative pan-BH3
mimetics: they do not fully meet the criteria for a bona
fide BH3 mimetic and induce apoptosis via multiple
mechanisms [19, 20, 23]. Like obatoclax, they showed
limited anticancer activity in clinical trials [15]. Several
gossypol and AT-101 derivatives such as sabutoclax (BIwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

no evidence of cancer in some patients), 54 % achieved
a partial response and overall, 59% of the patients have
survived for 2 years without leukemia progression; in
addition, the complete response rates were similar in highrisk patients including those having p53 deficiency due to
the deletion in chromosome 17 [32]. Moreover, several
promising clinical data have been lastly reported: notably
in phase I/II trials of ABT-199 in acute myeloid leukemia,
and of its combination with bendamustine, rituximab or
obinituzumab in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL [3336]. Phase III studies of ABT-199 (now venetoclax) are
ongoing.

A-155463 constitutes an actual BH3 mimetic specific for
BCL-XL.
Arylsulfonamide derivatives
Hybridization of the arylsulfonamide portion of
ABT-737 with an MCL-1 inhibitor resulted in a dual
BCL-XL/MCL-1 ligand with moderate (sub-µM) affinity
[42]. A substituted arylsulfonamide has shown selectivity
for MCL-1 (albeit with sub-µM binding affinity): this
molecule induces caspase-9 activation and apoptosis [43].
Interestingly, an approach similar to that used for the
ABT series has recently allowed the design of a biphenyl
arylsulfonamide molecule also targeting MCL-1 with an
apparent affinity of 30 nM; despite it is not known whether
this compound can induce apoptosis, it might serve as a
promising lead for optimized effects [44].

Other ABT-737 derivatives
Isosteric analogs of ABT-737 in which the
acylsulfonamide moiety is replaced by a quinazoline
group were synthesized: these quinazoline derivatives
have reduced capacities to bind BCL-W while keeping
their high-affinity binding to BCL-2 and BCL-XL [37].
The same characteristics were observed with other
acylsulfonamide derivatives, as previously reviewed [16].

MCL-1 inhibitor molecule-1 (MIM-1)
High-throughput screening of small molecules
displacing a stapled peptide derived from the BH3 domain
of MCL-1 has yielded a substituted thiazol molecule
called MIM-1 (for MCL-1 inhibitor molecule-1); this
small molecule specifically engages the binding groove of
MCL-1 and induces BAK-dependent apoptosis in MCL1-dependent cells [45]. However, the binding affinity for
MCL-1 is modest (4.8 µM), high concentrations of MIM-1
are required for apoptosis, and this activity depends on the
cell type [26].

BM-957 and BM-1197
BM-957 is another ABT-737 derivative (a diphenylpyrrole-carboxamide scaffold linked to the nitrobenzene
sulfonamide half of ABT-737): it also binds to BCL2 and BCL-XL with sub-nM affinity, induces caspase
3-dependent apoptosis in tumor cell lines and causes
tumor regression in xenograft models [38]. In order to
optimize their compound BM-957, Wang and colleagues
performed modifications of the pyrrole-carboxylic acid
core structure leading to the new small molecule BM1197 [39]. This compound binds to BCL-2 and BCL-XL
with sub-nM affinity, inhibits their antiapoptotic activities
and induces BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in small
cell lung cancer cell lines. In addition, BM-1197 shows
improved solubility and pharmacokinetic properties and
elicits complete and long-term tumor regression in two
different small cell lung cancer xenograft models [39].
Consequently, BM-1197 proves to be a new BAD-like
BH3 mimetic.

Small molecule MCL-1 inhibitor
Using their NMR-based fragment screen approach
(having led to ABT-737), Fesik and colleagues recently
identified two chemically distinct compounds that bind
to different sites of MCL-1; they then merged these
compounds together to produce molecules binding
MCL-1 selectively over BCL-2 and BCL-XL [46]. After
optimization, they obtained a lead compound [indole-2carboxylic acid] which binds and inhibits MCL-1 (with an
affinity of 55 nM) and induces apoptosis. Crystal structure
of the complex validates the strategy and provides detailed
information to design more potent inhibitors [46].

WEHI-539 and A-1155463

A-1210477

High-throughput screening of small molecules
targeting BCL-XL and structure-guided design led to the
discovery of WEHI-539, a molecule with a benzothiazole
hydrazone scaffold. This compound was the first highly
selective antagonist of BCL-XL (through high affinity
binding) over BCL-2 and BCL-W. Careful analysis
of its mechanism of action has shown that WEHI-539
induces BAK-mediated apoptosis [40]. NMR fragment
screening and structure-based design further led to the
characterization of A-1155463, a more potent BCL-XL
inhibitor than WEHI-539 while possessing none of its
pharmaceutical liabilities. Importantly, this compound
acts through an on-target mechanism and shows in vivo
antitumor activity in mice [41]. The new small molecule

A series of specific MCL-1 inhibitors exhibiting subnM affinity were obtained by high throughput screening
and structure-guided design [47]. The compounds are
indole-2-carboxylic acids like the small molecule MCL-1
inhibitor described by Fesik and colleagues [46], but have
a 100-fold higher binding affinity. Leverson et al have
further characterized the most potent of the compounds,
A-1210477: it binds selectively to MCL-1 with an affinity
of 0.45 nM, disrupts BIM/MCL-1 complexes in living
cells, induces the hallmarks of mitochondrial apoptosis
in MCL-1-dependent cancer cells and synergizes with
navitoclax to induce apoptosis in various malignant cell
lines [48]. Data also demonstrate that the compound acts
through an on-target mechanism. Therefore, A-1210477

found to act via multiple and off-target mechanisms [20,
52, 53]. A substituted derivative of S1 was designed and
characterized as showing a higher affinity for binding
MCL-1 (10 nM) and BCL-2 (20 nM) and a better
apoptotic activity in tumor cell lines than the parental S1
[54]. Unless the demonstration that this activity is BAX/
BAK-dependent, S1-derivative should be considered as
a putative pan-BH3 mimetic. Other S1-derivatives were
described as novel MCL-1 inhibitors [55, 56].

Mcl-1 inhibitor-9
A high-throughput screening approach culminated
in the characterization of a piperazine-substituted
hydroxyquinoline that inhibits selectively MCL-1. This
molecule called Mcl-1 inhibitor-9 was proposed to
function as a BH3 mimetic in inducing mitochondrial
apoptosis in cell lines [49] although the binding affinity
and mechanism of action have not been evaluated.

Acylsulfonamide molecules

Sesquiterpenoid derivatives

A fragment-based NMR method (other than the
Fesik’s approach) has allowed the generation of a series
of acylsulfonamides (different from the ABT series). The
small molecules exhibit high affinity (nM) for both BCLXL and MCL-1 [57]. However, their biological validation
has not been provided.

Screening a library of natural sesquiterpenoids
for disrupting the MCL-1/BIM BH3 complex led to the
identification of hexahydronaphtalene and the synthesis of
substituted derivatives. The most potent MCL-1 inhibitor
can engage the binding groove of MCL-1 in computational
docking experiments, and it shows antagonizing activity
in cancer cells [50]. This possible new class of MCL-1
inhibitor yet needs further development and biological
characterization.

Compound JY-1-106
SAR analysis of oligoamide foldamers led to the
design of JY-1-106, a substituted trisarylamide having the
ability to induce apoptosis in vitro and to repress tumor
growth in an animal model. Computational analyses
indicate that JY-1-106 engages the BH3-binding grooves
of both BCL-XL and MCL-1, suggesting that it may be a
pan-BH3 mimetic [58]. Whether JY-1-106 meets the two
criteria that define an authentic BH3 mimetic yet remains
to be stated.

S1 family
The small molecule S1 (an oxo-phenalenedicarbonitrile) binds to both BCL-2 and MCL-1 albeit
with moderate affinity (in the sub-µM range), triggers
BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis, and shows antitumor
activity in an animal model [51]. Although initially
proposed as a pan-BH3 mimetic, S1 was reportedly

generated from the BH3 domain of BID [71]. A SAHB
derived from the BH3 helix of BIM was recently described
[72]. This BIM SAHB (BIM 21-mer, residues 146-166)
binds with high affinity to BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1 and
A1, and it induces mitochondrial apoptosis in leukemia/
lymphoma cell lines and tumor regression in an animal
model of human leukemia [72]. Data indicate that the BIM
SAHB displays the hallmarks of an authentic pan-BH3
mimetic. However, the cell permeability, binding affinity
and biological activity of SAHB compounds are much
debated issues [73, 74]. They seem to depend on the cell
type inasmuch as BIM SAHB (residues 146-166) shows
activity in hematologic but not fibroblastic cell lines [75].
Other relevant stapled peptides were described
such as a SAHB modeled on the MCL-1 BH3 domain
which was characterized as a selective MCL-1 inhibitor
with proapoptotic properties in leukemia cell lines [76].
A SAHB derived from the BIM BH3 region was reported
to be able to bind the MOMP effector BAX at a site
that directly triggers its activation [77, 78]. These two
compounds have further served as probes to identify small
molecules with BH3 mimicry properties, respectively
MIM-1 (see previous section Small organic molecules)
and BAM-7 (described in next section Activators of
proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins.).

A number of small organic molecules designed
to mimic BH3 peptides have just been reported such
as a series of molecules containing a benzoylurea
scaffold which selectively bind to BCL-XL albeit with
µM affinity [59]. Is is also the case for several MCL-1
inhibitors including marinopyrrole derivatives, a single
diastereomer of a macrolactam core and compounds with
a 3-phenylthiophene-2-sulfonamide core moiety or with a
phenyl-piperazine-triazine scaffold [60-63]. Interestingly,
a small molecule targeting the prosurvival BCL-2 family
protein A1 has been identified for the first time [64].
Although these compounds require further characterization
and improvements, they may represent starting points for
developing new classes of inhibitors.

BH3 domain-derived peptides
Peptides hardly penetrate into cells and are prone to
rapid proteolytic degradation. Efforts focused to modify
peptides in order to increase the cell penetration and
stability and also to reproduce the helicity of BH3 domains
needed for high affinity binding.
α/β foldamers

BIM BH3-derived peptides of the XXA series

BIM and PUMA BH3 peptides were modified by
incorporating non-natural amino acids: this resulted in α/β
foldamer-peptides capable of binding to BCL-XL [65] and
to both BCL-XL and MCL-1 with high affinity [66], as
previously discussed [16]. It is furthermore noteworthy
that peptides with non-canonical BH3 domain sequences
were found to bind selectively to MCL-1, such as reverse
BH3 motifs with helical conformation [67] and a variant
of the BIM BH3 region, BimS2A [68]. However, the
proapoptotic properties of these peptides have not been
characterized with the exception of BimS2A which can
induce BAK-dependent apoptosis when BCL-XL is absent
or neutralized [68].

By combining computational design, combinatorial
library screening and rational mutagenesis, a series of
peptides derived from the BH3 region of BIM were
engineered. The lead compound XXA1 binds to BCL-XL
with sub-nM affinity (and selectivity up to 1000-fold over
other prosurvival proteins); it induces MOMP-dependent
apoptosis in human platelets (for which BCL-XL is a
survival factor) and malignant cell lines [79]. Therefore,
XXA1 may be considered as a new, putative BH3 mimetic
highly specific for BCL-XL.

ACTIVATORS OF PROAPOPTOTIC BCL-2
PROTEINS

Cross-linked NOXA-BH3 peptide
A short peptide derived from the BH3-only protein
NOXA was biphenyl cross-linked in order to stabilize the
helical conformation. The cross-linked BH3 peptide is
capable of binding selectively to MCL-1 with an affinity
comparable to that of NOXA (in the nM range) and it can
induce death in a lymphoma cell line [69]. Conjugating
this compound with ubiquitin further led to a MCL-1
antagonist with increased cell penetration and killing
activity [70]. Whether the biphenyl-NOXA BH3 peptide
actually induces BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis is not
known.

Recent studies have used the BH3 mimetic concept
to design small molecules having the ability to directly
bind and activate proapoptotic members of the BCL-2
family, as described below.

BAM-7
Walensky and colleagues first characterized a SAHB
modeled on the BIM BH3 region and capable of binding
the MOMP effector BAX at a site that directly triggers
its activation [77, 78]. They then used a computational
screen of small molecules for displacing their SAHB
from its ligand BAX, to obtain a substituted pirazolone
molecule called BAM-7; this compound can engage the

BIM SAHB and other stapled BH3 peptides
Another approach to stabilize the helical
conformation has been to staple BH3 peptides. The first

via off-target mechanisms) were disappointing. In contrast,
the two authentic BH3 mimetics navitoclax and ABT-199
(which are both derived from the pioneer molecule ABT737) proved to display anticancer efficacy particularly
in hematologic malignancies: significant therapeutic
effects were first observed with the BAD-like mimetic
navitoclax and impressive results were further recorded
with the BCL-2-specific ABT-199 that does not induce the
thrombocytopenia exhibited by navitoclax (due to BCL-XL
inhibition). These data have unequivocally demonstrated
that BH3 mimetic agents can expand the anticancer
armamentarium in combination with conventional
treatments.
None of the characterized BH3-derived peptides
have so far progressed towards clinical evaluation. This
does not mean that the approach to identifying BH3derived peptides is less promising than the approach of
screening small organic molecules. The former compounds
indeed display liability and pharmacologic difficulties,
whereas the latter are often prone to off-target effects. To
achieve high affinity binding to the targets is a frequent
issue for both types of compounds. A general conclusion
favoring either approach cannot be drawn yet.
Updating the small molecules targeting BCL-2
family proteins (as recapitulated in Table 1) highlights not
only new antagonists of prosurvival proteins but also the
possibility to design novel types of BH3 mimetics capable
of directly activating proapoptotic proteins.
As regards the newly identified antagonists of
prosurvival proteins, the first BH3 mimetic specific for
BCL-XL has been discovered with the highly potent
small-molecule inhibitor A-1155463 displaying ontarget, antitumor activity in vivo. The BH3 peptide
derivative XXA1 also appears as a candidate of interest.
The emergence of the compound A-1210477 - a potent
MCL-1 inhibitor with a high binding affinity and an ontarget mechanism of action - indicates that a NOXAlike BH3 mimetic specific for MCL-1 will rapidly be
obtained. Other MCL-1 antagonists might likewise be
probed such as the pioneer MIM-1, the remarkable Small
Molecule Mcl-1 Inhibitor, and a biphenyl cross-linked
NOXA peptide. The further characterization of TW-37
has revealed that modifications enhancing its affinity
for MCL-1 could also lead to an authentic NOXA-like
BH3 mimetic. The generation of pan-BH3 mimetics
(which are needed for replacing obatoclax and AT-101)
seems possible from the BIM SAHB or the gossypol
derivative sabutoclax that are known to inhibit a broad
range of prosurvival proteins. The small molecules S1derivative and JY-1-106 were also described as starting
points for designing pan-BH3 mimetics. Therefore, after
the emergence of the BAD-like BH3 mimetic navitoclax
and the BCL-2-specific ABT-199, the developments of
NOXA-like, BCL-XL-specific and pan-BH3 mimetics will
likely be achieved. Lastly, BM-1197 is added to navitoclax
as another, potent BAD-like BH3 mimetic displaying a

PUMA-BH3 peptide
Investigating the ability of the BH3-only proteins
NOXA and PUMA to directly activate the MOMP effector
BAK has highlighted a PUMA BH3 peptide that binds
with nM affinity to the canonical binding pocket of BAK
and induces its activation, leading to BAK-dependent
MOMP and cell death [81, 82]. This study supports
and extends others having indicated that different BH3
peptides as well as a BID SAHB can directly activate
BAK [83-85]. These data therefore provide proof-ofconcept that direct activators of BAK may be designed.

PUMA SAHB
A SAHB derived from the PUMA-BH3 helix was
found to display a dual activity: it can both engage all
the prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins (and inhibit their
activity) and directly bind and activate the proapoptotic
BAX [86]. In addition, a cell permeable analog of this
PUMA SAHB (capable of binding to BCL-2, MCL-1 and
BAX) induces mitochondrial apoptosis in neuroblastoma
cells [86]. These data demonstrate for the first time
that PUMA BH3 is a dual prosurvival inhibitor and
proapoptotic direct activator. It is therefore conceivable to
design BH3 mimetics having such a dual capacity.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Since the emergence of the BH3 mimetic concept
[4], targeting BCL-2 family proteins is considered to have
a promising therapeutic potential especially for treating
cancers [1, 2, 5]. Much progress has been made in this field
of research with the identification of numerous inhibitors
of prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins [6-16]. This field
yet remains very challenging. The nature of the interaction
between these compounds and their targets (protein/
protein interaction, large and hydrophobic pockets) makes
any program of drug discovery still difficult. Moreover,
many putative BH3 mimetics were reported with minimal
evidence of on-target effects. The low or modest binding
affinity of some compounds is notably responsible for offtarget effects. The difficulty to assess their mechanism of
action can also be misleading [87].
Nevertheless, four small organic molecules targeting
prosurvival BCL-2 family proteins have already entered
clinical trials in cancer patients [15]. The clinical results

AT-101 (that are now known to induce apoptosis mainly

particular therapeutic potential for small cell lung cancer.
Moreover, a new dimension to targeting BCL2 family proteins is provided by the discovery of two
novel types of small molecules capable of directly
activating proapoptotic members of the family. First,
after the identification of the small molecule BAM-7 as
a BAX activator, the finding that a PUMA BH3 peptide
can activate BAK confirms the possibility to generate
BH3 mimetics capable of directly activating the MOMP
effectors. Second, the characterization of a PUMA SAHB
analog which both activates BAX and antagonizes BCL2 and MCL-1 indicates that it is possible to design BH3
mimetics having the dual activity of prosurvival inhibitor
and proapoptotic activator.
Many efforts are obviously required to implement
the clinical application of the novel types of BH3
mimetics. Nevertheless, the therapeutic targeting of BCL2 family proteins already appears as a potent weapon
for overcoming the apoptotic resistance in cancers and
improving the treatments of patients.
