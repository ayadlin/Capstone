ABSTRACT
Anti-angiogenesis is currently considered as one of the major antitumor strategies
for its protective effects against tumor emergency and later progression. The anti-diabetic
drug metformin has been demonstrated to significantly inhibit tumor angiogenesis
based on recent studies. However, the mechanism underlying this anti-angiogenic effect
still remains an enigma. In this study, we investigated metformin-induced inhibitory
effect on tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Metformin pretreatment significantly
suppressed tumor paracrine signaling-induced angiogenic promotion even in the
presence of heregulin (HRG)-β1 (a co-activator of HER2) pretreatment of HER2+ tumor
cells. Similar to that of AG825, a specific inhibitor of HER2 phosphorylation, metformin
treatment decreased both total and phosphorylation (Tyr 1221/1222) levels of HER2
protein and significantly reduced microvessel density and the amount of Fitc-conjugated
Dextran leaking outside the vessel. Furthermore, our results of VEGF-neutralizing and
-rescuing tests showed that metformin markedly abrogated HER2 signaling-induced
tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF secretion. Inhibition of HIF-1α signaling by
using RNAi or YC-1, a specific inhibitor of HIF-1α synthesis, both completely diminished
mRNA level of VEGF and greatly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation promoted by
HER2+ tumor cell-conditioned medium in both the absence and presence of HRG-β1
pretreatment. Importantly, metformin treatment decreased the number of HIF-1α
nucleus positive cells in 4T1 tumors, accompanied by decreased microvessel density.
Our data thus provides novel insight into the mechanism underlying the metformininduced inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and indicates possibilities of HIF-1α-VEGF
signaling axis in mediating HER2-induced tumor angiogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

HIF-1α is involved in HER2-induced VEGF upregulation [15]. Indeed, HIF-1α has been demonstrated
to be important for HER2 signaling-induced tumor
progression and angiogenesis [16]. In this study, we
explored if the HIF-1α-VEGF secretion axis was involved
in metformin-induced angiogenic abrogation of cancer
cells with highly phosphorylated HER2. To further
study the effects of metformin on suppressing HER2
signaling-associated angiogenesis, recombinant heregulin
(HRG)-β1, a co-activator of HER2, and AG825, a specific
inhibitor of HER2 phosphorylation [17], were used for
treatment of HER2+ cell lines. Through decreasing the
production of HER2 protein, metformin induced a similar
effects as AG825 on suppressing HER2 phosphorylation,
thus restraining the activity of HIF-1α-VEGF signaling
axis and suppressing tumor angiogenesis in vivo.

Angiogenesis, the formation of nascent blood vessels
from preexisting vasculature, is a fundamental event in
the process of tumor growth. However, this physiological
process can be tamed by tumor cells mediating distant
metastasis or dissemination [1, 2]. From the early stage
of tumorigenesis, tumor cells produce a large number of
pro-angiogenic factors to form a nascent vascular network
that subsequently penetrates deep into the tumor [3]. This
kind of vasculature induced by tumor cells is essential for
tumor growth, because it is capable of transporting oxygen
and nutrients into tumor, thus supporting tumor growth
and progression. However, tumor cells migrating into
the internal lumen of vessels can also be transported to
nearby tissues or distant organs, thus forming new tumor
lesions. It has been recently reported that, therapies aimed
at targeting tumor angiogenesis not only suppressed tumor
growth, but also reduced the risk of tumor metastasis
and led to better survival rates [4]. Therefore, antiangiogenesis, an antitumor strategy introduced by Judah
Folkman nearly four decades ago, is currently considered
as a major antitumor modality [4, 5].
Metformin, a biguanide derivate, is the most
widely prescribed drug for medical management of types
II diabetes (T2D) and in the recent guidelines of the
American Diabetes Association (ADA), it is recommended
as a first-line oral treatment for the disease [6]. Since the
last decade, metformin has attracted attentions again
for its significant antitumor activities [7–9]. The recent
evidence has accumulated suggesting that metformin has
the potential to impede in vitro angiogenesis mediated
by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
[10, 11]. As was observed in other in vivo models,
metformin greatly hindered angiogenesis in matrigel
pellets and significantly decreased the microvessel
density (MVD) in solid tumors [9, 12]. This evidence
has revealed the potential of metformin in suppressing
tumor angiogenesis. Although recent studies suggest
that metformin may actively target components of the
microenvironment [9], in fact, paracrine mechanisms
mediated by angiogenic factors released by tumor cells
play an essential role in promoting angiogenesis in
the process of tumor development [3]. However, the
underlying mechanisms of whether or how metformin
inhibits tumor angiogenesis by affecting tumor secretion
of angiogenic cytokines secretion remains unknown.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2),
a member of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
family, is overexpressed in about 25% of invasive breast
cancers and its expression is positively correlated with
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-associated
high vascularity of within solid tumor [13, 14]. Although
hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) has been shown
to directly regulate VEGF expression and secretion,
it is still largely unknown whether, or to what extent,

RESULTS
Protein expressions of HER2, HIF-1α, and
VEGF in various breast cell lines
We first detected the protein expressions of
phosphos-HER2, HIF-1α and VEGFA in eight breast
cell lines. Because EGF was added to the culture
medium, HER2 was greatly phosphorylated in MCF-10A
(Figure 1A), a normal mammary epithelial cell. However,
the HIF-1α-VEGF signaling axis was not apparently
activated in these cells (Figure 1A–1C). In the tri-negative
cell line, MDA-MB-231, low levels of phospho-HER2
were accompanied by low protein levels of HIF-1α
and VEGF (Figure 1A–1C). Inversely, HIF-1α-VEGF
signaling was highly activated in cancer cell lines (MDAMB-453, SKBR3 and 4T1) with highly phosphorylated
HER2 protein (Figure 1A–1C). Besides, HIF-1α was
also highly expressed in T47D and MCF-7 cells,
which have been generally recognized as the estrogen
receptor (ER) (+)/ progestin receptor (PR) (+) cell lines
(Figure 1A and 1B). These data indicated that HER2
might be an oncogene that was closely correlated with the
expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF , like ER and PR.

Metformin inhibited HER2+ tumor angiogenesis
via a paracrine mechanism
We then investigated the effect of metformin on
suppressing the angiogenesis promoted by the paracrine
signaling of HER2+ tumor cells. Tumor cell conditioned
medium (TCM) from 4T1 and MDA-MB-453 cells
pre-treated with or without metformin was used to culture
endothelial cells (ECs). As shown in tube formation
assay results (Figure 2A and 2B), ECs (HUVEC and
HMEC-1) treated with 4T1 or MDA-MB-453 TCM
developed longer tube structures than those cultured in
serum-free medium (SFM). However, tumor cells were
pre-treated with 10 mM metformin, the tube length

vivo tumor angiogenesis, aiming to investigate metformininduced anti-angiogenic effect via affecting cancerendothelial cells interaction. In this system, cancer cells
can’t directly contact with ECs, and the molecular and drug
particles can freely diffuse. In the absence of co-culture,
metformin directly weakened the vascular sprouting ability
of HUVECs (Figure 2D and 2E), suggesting metformin
has a direct effect on suppressing EC function. In addition,
HUVECs generated more and longer vascular sprouts in coculture with MDA-MB-453 cells than those that were not
co-cultured. Importantly, co-culture-associated increases of
number and length of vascular sprouts were significantly
abrogated by metformin treatment. To further verify the
direct effect of metformin, we focused on the changes of
HUVECs viability and tube formation ability. As shown
in (Figure 2F and 2G), metformin significantly suppressed
HUVECs proliferation and tube formation ability. Taken
together, our data demonstrated the dual effects of
metformin on suppressing tumor angiogenesis: directly

produced by HUVECs was significantly reduced to
a level slightly higher than that in cells treated with
SFM (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1). Since
EC proliferation is an essential element in the process
of angiogenesis, we next investigated if metformin
affected TCM-promoted EC proliferation. As shown,
HUVECs proliferation-promoted by TCM of both
MDA-MB-453 and 4T1 cells was significantly abrogated
by metformin pretreatment via a time-dependent manner
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S2). These data
indicated that metformin potentially repress paracrine
signaling-mediated angiogenesis of HER2+ tumor cells.

Metformin suppressed vascular sprouting ability
of EC in a co-culture system
Since tumor angiogenesis results from the interaction
of cancer cells with endothelial cells for the most part, we
next utilized an indirect coculture system to simulate the in

restraining the ECs function and indirectly impeding tumor
paracrine signaling.

To study whether HER2 signaling was involved
in metformin-induced angiogenesis suppression, we
next detected the change of HER2 expression using
IHC and western blotting experiments. As shown in
Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S3, 4T1 tumor
tissue from metformin treated mice showed a lower
level of phospho-HER2 (Tyr 1221/1222). In addition,
metformin greatly decreased the phosphorylation level
of HER2 protein in vitro via a time-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure S4). Consistent with our
histological results, metformin apparently decreased
both total and phosphorylated levels of HER2 proteins
in both 4T1 and MDA-MB-453 cells (Figure 3E),
while the mRNA level was not obviously affected
(Supplementary Figure S5). Since HER2 signaling has
a strong effect on promoting tumor proliferation, we
next focused on the effect of metformin on inhibiting
tumor growth in vivo. We found that metformin
treatment induced a significant inhibition of 4T1 tumor
growth in vivo (Figure 3F and 3G). Altogether, our data
suggest HER2 may be an important molecular target of
metformin in mediating inhibition of tumor growth and
angiogenesis.

HER2 signaling was involved in metformininduced angiogenic suppression in 4T1 breast
cancer model
To investigate the effect of metformin on suppressing
in vivo tumor angiogenesis, we next used the transplanted
murine 4T1 cancer model, which is poorly immunogenic
and highly vascularized. Consistent with its high VEGF
expression, 4T1 tumor was characterized by high MVD,
vascular leakage and intense blood vessel leakage
(Figure 3A). Immunofluorescent results demonstrated that
metformin treatment (200 mg/kg • day) greatly decreased
the MVD and reduced the length of vascular sprout in 4T1
tumors (Figure 3A and 3B). Because vascular dilation has
been demonstrated to be one important hallmark of tumor
vasculature, we next focused on the effect of metformin on
decreasing the diameter of tumor vessels. In metformintreated samples, large-diameter vessels typically seen in
4T1 tumors were rarely detectable and the tumor vessel size
was smaller (Figure 3A and 3C).

Metformin abrogated HER2-induced angiogenic
promotion involving up-regulated VEGF
expression

[18, 19, 22, 23]. To determine the underlying mechanism
by which metformin diminished HRG-β1-HER2
signaling-induced promotion of tumor angiogenesis,
we detected the change of intracellular expression of
VEGF165, the major secreted isoform of VEGF [24].
Compared with MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, VEGF165
protein expression was only detected in MDA-MB-453
cell line (Figure 5A and 5B). In comparison with control,
HRG-β1 treatment resulted in a great increase of VEGF165
in MDA-MB-453 (Figure 5A and 5B), while did not
apparently changed the undetectable status of VEGF165
in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Critically,
metformin treatment led to a great decrease of both
mRNA and protein levels of VEGF even in the presence
HRG-β1 (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S6). Since
VEGF was originally known as a vascular permeability
factor inducing intense blood vessel leakage [25], we
next studied the effect of metformin on tumor vessel
leakage using a 70 kd Fitc-conjugated Dextran. As shown,
metformin greatly reduced the amount of dextran leaking
outside the tumor vessels (Figure 5C).

Since endogenous HRGs has been generally
recognized for their crucial roles in promoting
angiogenesis by enhancing HER2 signaling [18–21],
we thus used human recombinant HRG-β1 as a HER2
activator for further investigation. As shown in Figure 4A,
HUVECs cultured in TCM from HRG-β1 pretreated
MDA-MB-453 cells showed a stronger migration capacity
than those cultured in TCM from MDA-MB-453 cells
with no pretreatment. Moreover, metformin pretreatment
greatly abrogated HRG-β1-induced promotion of invasion,
proliferation and tube formation abilities of HUVECs
(Figure 4B–4D). Even in the absence of HRG-β1
pretreatment, MDA-MB-453 TCM induced-enhancement
of EC-mediated angiogenesis was also greatly impaired.
At present, VEGF is widely thought to be one of
the most important angiogenic stimulators in mediating
HRG-β1-HER2 signaling induced tumor angiogenesis

To further validate the critical role of VEGF
in mediating HER2-induced tumor angiogenesis,
bevacizumab (BEV), a specific VEGF neutralizing
antibody, and recombinant VEGFA were added to
TCM of MDA-MB-453 cells. As shown, BEV greatly
inhibited HUVECs proliferation-promoted by the
TCM of MDA-MB-453 cells with or not with HRG-β1
pretreatment (Figure 5D). Moreover, the proliferative
inhibition-induced by metformin pretreatment was
apparently impeded by adding recombinant VEGF
(10 ng/ml) to the TCM of MDA-MB-453 (Figure 5E).
These data demonstrated the involvement of VEGF in
mediating HER2+ tumor angiogenesis and suggest VEGF
is an important target of metformin for inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis.

decreasing its total protein level (Figure 6A). Notably,
both mRNA and protein levels of VEGF in MDA-MB-453
were all greatly decreased by AG825 in both the presence
and the absence of HRG-β1 (Figure 6A–6B). Compared
with metformin treatment, AG825 exhibited similar
inhibition of 4T1 tumor growth in BALB/C mice (Figure
6C). Additionally, AG825 treatment decreased the VEGF
expression and MVD in the sections of 4T1 tumors
(Figure 6D and 6E). These findings indicate that HER2
signaling-induced VEGF up-regulation was associated
with a transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Conversely,
therapies inhibiting HER2 signaling should block HER2induced transcriptional activation of VEGF signaling
pathway, thus leading to inhibition of angiogenesis in
HER2+ cancers.

AG825, a HER2-specific inhibitor, abrogated
HER2-indcued VEGF expression and reduced
microvessel density in HER2+ 4T1 tumors

HIF-1α was required for HER2+ tumor
angiogenesis and involved in metformin-induced
anti-angiogenesis

As has been well documented, AG825 is a powerful
inhibitor of HER2 signaling independent of total HER2
protein expression. To verify our hypothesis that HER2VEGF signaling was involved in metformin-induced
angiogenic suppression, we investigated a possible link
between AG825 induced HER2 inhibition and suppressed
tumor angiogenesis. As expected, AG825 reduced the
phosphorylation level of HER2 while not apparently

In this paper, we have observed the effect of
metformin on decreasing VEGF mRNA abundance in
HER2+ cancer cells. Since HIF-1α has been generally
recognized as a direct transcriptional regulator of VEGF
[26], we thus intended to determine whether HIF-1α was
involved in metformin-induced VEGF down-regulation
through targeting HER2 signaling. To address this, we
used the reagent YC-1, a HIF-1α inhibitor [27, 28], and

built RNA interference (RNAi) model to further clarify
the role of HIF-1α in HER2 signaling-induced VEGF
up-regulation. HRG-β1 induced increased HIF-1α and
VEGF expressions in MDA-MB-453 cells in normoxia
(Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure S7). Notably,
YC-1 and RNAi-HIF-1α both greatly diminished the
expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF proteins even in the
presence of HRG-β1 treatment without affecting HER2
protein expression (Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure
S7 and S8). However, the mRNA level of HIF-1α was not
apparently affected by AG825, HRG-β1, or metformin
treatment (Figure 7B), suggesting a mechanism involving
regulation of HIF-1α protein level.
To further confirm the requirement of HIF-1α
in HER2 signaling, we performed the tube formation
assay using TCM from MDA-MB-453 cells pretreated
with RNAi-HIF-1α. Inhibition of HIF-1α by using
RNAi or YC-1 both greatly abrogated HRG-β1-induced
promotion of angiogenesis (Supplementary Figure S9),
thus demonstrating the requirement of HIF-1α for HER2induced angiogenesis. We then detected the changes of
VEGF mRNA level in MDA-MB-453 cells to demonstrate
the transcriptional regulation mechanism. As shown
in Figure 7C, YC-1 almost completely diminished the
mRNA level of VEGF in both the absence and presence
of HRG-β1. Additionally, YC-1 pretreatment decreased

MDA-MB-453 TCM-promoted HUVECs proliferation to
a comparable level of the SFM group, even in the presence
of HRG-β1 pretreatment (Figure 7D).
We next focused on the mechanism underlying
metformin-induced HIF-1α inhibition by using the reagent
MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and cycloheximide
(CHX), a inhibitor of protein generation. Similar to
AG825, metformin reduced the protein level of HIF-1α
in normoxia (Figure 7E), indicating that metformin–
induced down-regulation of HIF-1α involved HER2
signaling. In the presence of MG132, HIF-1α protein
expression increased immensely in MDA-MB-453 cells,
suggesting that MG132 caused the newly generated
HIF-1α to accumulate through blocking proteasomemediated HIF-1α gradation. Interestingly, both metformin
and AG825 induced a similar inhibition of HIF-1α
accumulation in the presence of MG132. Furthermore,
HER2-HRG-β1 signaling-induced HIF-1α expression
was completely abrogated by CHX (Supplementary Figure
S10). Together with the evidence that HER2 increased the
rate of HIF-1α synthesis [16], our present data support the
possibility that metformin slowed down HIF-1α synthesis
by targeting HER2 signaling, thus leading to decreased
HIF-1α expression.
We next sought to determine whether HIF-1α was
implicated in metformin-mediated inhibition of in vivo

tumor angiogenesis. As shown in Figure 7F, metformin
treatment reduced the number of HIF-1α nucleus positive
cells in 4T1 tumors, as with AG825 or YC-1. For further
investigation, we performed immunofluorescence
double staining for CD31 and HIF-1α. In 4T1 tumors
from untreated mice, high HIF-1α expression was
accompanied by the high microvessel density (Figure 7G
and Supplementary Figure S11). Importantly, the HIF1α fluorescent signal in 4T1 tumors from metforminor AG825-treated mice was lower than that in tumors
from untreated mice, together with the decreased vessel
number (Figure 7G). Our results showed the mechanism
of HIF-1α-mediated VEGF transcriptional regulation
was significantly involved in metformin induced antiangiogenesis.

cancer-specific survival outcome of patients only if
they had hormone receptor- or HER2-positive tumors
[32]. Although metformin treatment might provide a
survival benefit when added to systematic therapy [33],
the underlying mechanism of metformin targets HER2
signaling was less understood. In the present study,
both our in vivo and in vitro data demonstrated the
significant effects of metformin on suppressing HER2
signaling and tumor angiogenesis and growth. Unlike
the roles of AG825 and HRG-β1 in affecting HER2
phosphorylation, metformin-induced reduction of HER2
phosphorylation are more likely mediated by decreasing
HER2 protein expression. This possibility is supported
by the fact that metformin drastically down-regulated
HER2 protein levels regardless of the molecular
mechanism contributing to the HER2 overexpression
[34]. Mechanistically, metformin-induced suppression
of HER2 overexpression appears to occur via direct
inhibition of p70S6K1 activity, which was demonstrated
to be independent of AMPK signaling. In spite of this,
whether metformin directly affect the phosphorylation
level of HER2 protein needs to be further defined.
One of the important findings is that metformin
significantly impaired HRG-β1-induced angiogenic

promotion by suppressing the secretion of angiogenic
cytokines from tumor cells with high level of phosphoHER2 protein. This effect of HRG-β1 is similar to the
re-establishment of HER2 overexpression in cancer cells
that endogenously express low levels of HER2 protein
[35]. Although HRG does not directly bind to HER2
protein, it can indirectly activates HER2 by promoting
the formation of heterodimers with HER3 or HER 4 via
transmodulation and transphosphorylation [36]. Notably,
HER2 overexpression greatly enhanced the binding
affinity of HRG to its receptors by diminishing the rates
of ligand dissociation [37]. Conversely, abolishment of
HER2 expression on the cell membrane attenuates ligand
binding affinity and the functions of HER2 signaling

[38], suggesting that HER2 and HRG may strengthen
their own signaling function via a mutual complementary
mechanism. Based on these finding, it is reasonable
to speculate that metformin may accelerate the rates of
ligand dissociation by decreasing the protein level of
HER2, thus leading to abrogation of the pro-angiogenic
effect of HRG-β1-HER2 signaling. However, HRG-β1
can also enhance tumor angiogenesis even in the presence
of extremely low HER2 protein level via up-regulation of
VEGF [20]. Further study are needed to address whether
or how metformin affects HRG-β1-induced angiogenic
promotion, even in the absence of HER2 overexpression.

and pathological conditions, has been mechanistically
implicated in HER2 signaling induced abnormal
angiogenesis and intense blood vessel leakage in cancers.
In light of this discovery, anti-cancer therapies targeting
VEGF have been well developed and have shown
significant clinical benefits [39]. Indeed, BEV did not
completely block the angiogenic promotion-induced by
TCM of tumor cells with HER2 overexpression, indicating
that there exist other pro-angiogenic factors secreted by
tumor cells to promote angiogenesis. Even so, VEGF
appears to be the most important factor for mediating
HER2 signaling induced angiogenic promotion. In the
present study, metformin treatment exerted its inhibitory
effect on VEGF expression and secretion, and restrained
paracrine VEGF signaling induced tumor angiogenesis.
In support of this notion, the vessels in 4T1 tumors
from metformin-treated mice were less leaky and had
less ability to sprout. Besides, metformin was reported
to inhibit VEGF-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in
HUVECs [40]. These findings suggest a potential concept
that metformin has dual effects on VEGF signalingmediated tumor angiogenesis: on one hand, metformin
decreases the secretion of VEGF from tumor cells by
targeting HER2 signaling; on the other hand, metformin
has the inhibitory effects on VEGF signaling.
Although HIF-1α is required to transcriptionally
regulate VEGF expression [41], it is still controversial
whether HIF-1α is directly involved in HER2-induced
VEGF expression [16, 42]. Our results of protein
expression screening showed a high level of HIF1α accumulation in HER2+ cancer cells, which were
accompanied by high VEGF expression. This finding
indicates the possible link between HER2 and HIF-1αVEGF signaling. Decreased HIF-1α protein expression
by YC-1, a HIF-1α synthesis inhibitor, almost completely
inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of VEGF,
even in the presence of HRG-β1 treatment. However,
unlike bevacizumab-induced partial inhibition, YC-1
pretreatment induced an almost complete inhibition of
cancer TCM-induced promotion of EC proliferation.
The above-mentioned discrepancy also implies that HIF1α is indispensable for mediating angiogenesis in tumor
cells with HER2 overexpression even in normoxia,
which is supported by our results related to siRNA for
HIF-1α. Interestingly, metformin induced a slightly
stronger inhibition of TCM-mediated EC proliferation
than bevacizumab, indicating that metformin may also
target other tumor cell-derived angiogenic cytokines.
Recently, HER2 signaling was reported to increase the
synthesis rate of HIF-1α protein and thus enhance VEGFmediated abnormal tumor angiogenesis. This evidence
illustrates the important role of HIF-1α-VEGF signaling
in mediating HER2 signaling-induced angiogenesis. In
the present study, metformin exerted a similar effects with
AG825 on decreasing the protein expression of HIF-1α.
Altogether, these evidences suggest that HIF-α is involved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in mediating HER2-induced VEGF up-regulation. This is
supported by the fact that metformin exerted similar effects
with YC-1 and AG825 on decreasing HIF-1α and VEGF
expressions, which was accompanied by decreased MVD
in 4T1 tumors. However, YC-1 has been demonstrated to
decrease the VEGF expression via inhibition of PI3K or
NFκB [43], which may act independent of HIF1-α.
The clinical implications of the present findings
propose that HER2 was a potential molecular hallmark
to predict the anti-angiogenesis response of tumors to
metformin treatment. As overexpression of HER2 is
frequently detected in various human cancers, our findings
are highly relevant to human cancer patients. Since
anti-angiogenesis had been demonstrated to be capable
of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutics via
normalizing tumor vasculature, our findings thus provide
an important implication that metformin may have the
potential of remodeling the abnormal tumor vasculature.
Since HER2 positive cancer only account for a part of all
cancers [45], therefore, further studies should be focused
on exploring more molecular hallmarks, which could be
significantly targeted by metformin to suppress tumor
angiogenesis, and on investigating whether metformin can
remodel tumor vasculature and benefit traditional chemoand radio-therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and materials
MCF-10A cells were maintained in phenol red free
DMEM/F12 culture medium as suggested by official
website of American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
All other cell lines mentioned in the present study were
obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air at
37°C. MG132 and metformin were purchased from SigmaAldrich (USA). AG825 and YC-1 were obtained from
Cayman company (USA) and the recombinant human
HRG-β1 was purchased from PeproTech corporation
(USA).

Animals and 4T1 xenograft model
The experimental protocol was approved by the
Ethical Committee and the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University. To
establish the 4T1 cancer cell xenograft model, 1 × 106
4T1 tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into
the left thigh of 6–8 weeks old female BALB/C mice.
According to our observation, the average daily intake
of drinking water of each mouse was about 3 mL. Nine
days after the transplantation, the mice were randomly
divided into four groups (n = 6). BALB/C mice in the
control group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with
44588

Oncotarget

0.1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) daily. Animals in
treatment groups were injected i.p. with AG825 at a dose
of 10 mg/kg or YC-1 at a dose of 10 mg/kg day. For the
metformin treatment group, metformin (200 mg/kg • day)
was added to the drinking water. It was observed that
metformin treatment induced no significant difference in
the intake of drinking water. The tumor volumes were
measured every two or three days by using a caliper and
calculated by the following formula: length × width2 ×
0.523. Since severe organ dysfunction related to distant
metastasis will interfere with our observation of tumor
growth, the xenograft experiment was thus terminated
when average tumor volume of the untreated group
reached 1 cm3. All animals were sacrificed by injecting
90 μl ethyl carbamate (20%) into the abdominal space,
and tumors were integrally removed and measured by an
electronic balance.

of a 96-well plate for polymerization at 37°C for 30
minutes. Then, 20,000 or 12,000 HUVECs were seeded
into each well in SFM or 75% TCM. After incubation
for 12 h or 24 h at 37°C, a capillary-like network
was formed and the pictures were recorded by an
upright microscope. Finally, the length of the vascular
network was measured by using ImageJ 2x software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Cell proliferation assay
CCK-8 (Cell counting kit-8, DoJinDO, Japan)
assay was performed to observe the changes of HUVECs
viability following the protocol. The final absorbance of
each well was determined at 450 nm using a micro-plate
reader.

Huvecs invasion assay

Preparation of tumor cell-conditioned medium

For invasion assays, the membrane surface of
Transwell (pore size: 8 μm, Corning, USA) was precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and incubated
at 37°C for 30 min. HUVECs (50,000 in DMEM with
2.5% FBS) were inoculated onto the upper chambers,
and the bottom chambers were filled with the mixture
of 75% TCM and 25% DMEM supplemented with 2.5%
FBS. HUVECs were allowed to invade for 10 h at 37°C
and 5% CO2. After scraping the cells on the top surface,
the invaded cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 1 h and
washed for three times with PBS, followed by staining
with crystal violet and air dry at room temperature.
Images were finally taken using a Leica inverted microscope.

To extract tumor cell-conditioned supernatants,
1 × 106 tumor cells were inoculated in 6 cm petri dishes
and cultured in 10% FBS DMEM supplemented with
metformin, HRG-β1, YC-1, AG825 or the combined
pretreatment for 24 h. Then tumor cells were washed three
times with PBS and subsequently cultured in SFM for
another 24 h. Following the inoculation period, TCM was
collected and centrifuged at 500 × g to remove detached
cells and then at 12,000 g to discard cell debris (4°C, 10
minutes each). Each corresponding dish was subsequently
trypsinized, and the number of live cells was counted to
allow an appropriate correction of TCM loading for cell
equivalents.

Quantitative real-time pcr and western blotting

Co-culture vascular sprout assay

The quantitative Real Time PCR was performed
to determine the changes of VEGF and HIF1α mRNA levels. The primer sequences used for
amplifications were as follows (5` to 3`): HIF-1α: AGT
GGTATTATTCAGCACGAC (forward), AAGGCAGC
TTGTATCCTCT (reverse); VEGF: CATGGATG
TCTACCAGCGAA (forward), CCAGGATTTAAACC
GGGAT (reverse); HER2: TCCATCATCTCTGCGGTGGT
(forward), CAGCAGTCTCCGCATCGTGT (reverse).
To detect the protein levels, the equal amount of
protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to polyvinyldifluoride membranes (Millipore, USA).
Then membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight
with antibodies, including anti-HIF-1α antibody
(Abcam, USA), anti-VEGF antibody (Proteintech),
anti-HER2 antibody (Sangon, China) and anti-p-HER2
(Phospho-Tyr1221/Tyr1222) antibody (Sangon, China),
and followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase. Band intensity was finally determined using
ImageJ 2x software.

To mimic the in vivo angiogenesis, we used a cell
culture insert with polycarbonate membrane (pore size:
0.4 μm, Thermo Scientific Nunc, USA). This insert was
pre-packed in a 6-well multidish. 20,000 HUVECs and
40,000 tumor cells were respectively seeded onto the
bottom of the well and the inside surface of the insert.
All the cells were further cultured with SFM for 24 h.
After that, the insert and culture medium were removed,
and HUVECs were washed three times with PBS. Then,
HUVECs were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
and stained with haematoxylin and esion (H&E). Five
random fields of each well were subsequently recorded by
a light microscopy (Leica, German). Finally, the number
and length of the sprout per HUVEC was quantified and
statistically analyzed.

Guangzhou (NO.2013J2200024).

4T1 tumor specimens were embedded into paraffin
and subsequently cut into 4 μm-thick sections. To
performing the morphological analysis, tumor sections
were immunolabeled with the HIF-1α (1:200), VEGF
(1:400), EC-marker CD31 (Abcam, 1:100) and p-HER2
(1:400).
For fluorescent analysis, frozen tumor samples were
cut into 8 μm-thick sections with cryostat. Tumor vessels
were immunolabeled with rabbit anti-CD31 antibody
(1:40) and followed by the goat anti-rabbit antibody
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Tech, USA). 3D
reconstruction was performed to investigate the change of
vascular branches. Tumor sections from different groups
were also incubated with HIF-1α antibody (1:50) and
followed by the donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Tech, USA). Double stained
sections for CD31 and HIF-1α were recorded using
fluorescence microscopy (Leica, German).

Determination of vascular leakage
To study functional impacts of metformin on vessel
leakage of 4T1 tumors, 100 mg/ml Fitc-conjugated
Dextran (70 kD; Sigma) in 100 μl was injected
intravenously via the tail vein into BALB/C mice. After
30 min to allow circulation, mice were euthanized by
cervical dislocation and 4T1 tumors were removed
without perfusion. Then, tumors were allowed to be fixed
in 4% PFA for 8 h and subsequently immersed in 30%
sucrose until all the tumors sank to the bottom of the
container. Then the solid tumors were embedded in OCT
and 6 μm sections were cut. The extent of Fitc-dextran
leakage from blood vessels was estimated on the basis
of green fluorescence located external to CD31-positive
(Red, TRITC-conjugated) vessels.
