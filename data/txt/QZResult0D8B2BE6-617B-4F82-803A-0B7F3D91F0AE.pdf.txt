ABSTRACT
Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy with the monoclonal antibodies
cetuximab and panitumumab is the main targeted treatment to combine with standard
chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Many clinical studies have shown the
benefit of the addition of these agents for patients without mutations in the EGFR
pathway. Many biomarkers, including KRAS and NRAS mutations, BRAF mutations,
PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, AREG and EREG expression, and HER-2 amplification
have already been identified to select responders to anti-EGFR agents. Among these
alterations KRAS and NRAS mutations are currently recognized as the best predictive
factors for primary resistance. Liquid biopsy, which helps to isolate circulating tumor
DNA, is an innovative method to study both primary and acquired resistance to antiEGFR monoclonal antibodies. However, high-sensitivity techniques should be used to
enable the identification of a wide set of gene mutations related to resistance.

INTRODUCTION

biological agents mainly target two different pathways:
tumor growth mediated by proangiogenic factors, and
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-triggered
cell proliferation [3]. Predictive biomarkers with clinical
relevance for sensitivity to anti-angiogenic drugs have not
yet been defined [4]. Conversely, anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibodies (moAbs) are effective in those patients whose
tumors do not have specific biomarkers, such as KRAS,
NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA gene mutations [5, 6]. The
establishment of the predictive role of these and other
biomarkers has allowed the identification of patients
suitable for anti-angiogenic therapy and spares others from
unnecessary anti-EGFR therapy [7, 8].
The majority of these biomarkers are still under
investigation to define the mechanisms of primary

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes
of cancer-related death. Around half of CRC patients
develop distant metastases, which can be detected early at
diagnosis or at a later stage. Despite the development of
different treatment options, the outcome for patients with
unresectable metastatic lesions is still unfavorable and
the metastatic spread to the liver is the major contributor
to mortality in CRC. New drugs such as oxaliplatin,
irinotecan, bevacizumab, aflibercept, cetuximab,
panitumumab and regorafenib have led to a significant
improvement in median survival from 6-7 months to
24-30 months in patients with unresectable metastatic
CRC (mCRC), also improving quality of life [1, 2]. New

evaluating the development of acquired resistance to antiEGFR moAbs.
The new methodology of liquid biopsy has added
new perspectives to the standard biomarker evaluation
in tissue biopsy. The different sensitivity of various
techniques is the main parameter to reach proper clinical
validation. This review aims to highlight the recent status
of translational research on mechanisms and predictive
factors of intrinsic and acquired resistance.

the most important features of a circulating biomarker,
i.e. to be highly specific for a pathological condition. The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is an international database
that collects genomic information from cancer genome
sequencing and it is contributing to expand knowledge
about the molecular biology of several tumor types. It is
noteworthy that almost every tumor type harbors somatic
genetic alterations and that these somatic alterations arise
prevalently in cancer cells. Therefore somatic alterations
are 100% specific for cancer and can be used as specific
biomarkers from a biological perspective [18]. Until some
time ago the only source of tumor DNA was represented
by a tumor tissue sample, but nowadays we know that
DNA, from both healthy and cancer cells, is also diffused
into the circulation. Therefore a relatively non-invasive
source of tumor DNA is represented by plasma or serum.
Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising
candidate biomarker for the detection, monitoring and
prognostic prediction of malignant tumors and can be
defined also as a liquid biopsy [19, 20]. A liquid biopsy is
a biomarker that can be easily isolated from blood and, as
well as a tissue biopsy, is representative of the tissue from
which it is spread [21].

THE IMPORTANCE OF DETECTION
METHODS
In recent years, new targeted therapies have been
exploited in the treatment of mCRC patients. Cetuximab
and Panitumumab are monoclonal antibodies that bind to
EGFR, causing anti-tumor activity [9-12]. Nevertheless,
these drugs show a clinical benefit in only a small
percentage of cancer patients and this is mainly due to
molecular alterations in EGFR pathway effectors [13]. It
has been demonstrated in several randomized controlled
trials that somatic single-nucleotide point mutations
in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene determine a
constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, thus leading
to anti-EGFR treatment resistance. KRAS mutations are
negative predictive markers and patient selection for antiEGFR treatment is dependent on KRAS mutational status
[12]. Recently it has been proved that the mutational status
of other RAS family genes (specifically NRAS), but also
KRAS mutations outside exon 2, are negative predictors
for response to anti-EGFR drugs [14]. Furthermore, a
recent meta-analysis demonstrated that approximately
20% of KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors harbor one of the
new RAS mutations. Thus CRC patients without any RAS
mutations (either KRAS exon 2 or new RAS mutations)
significantly benefit from anti-EGFR treatment compared
with tumors with any of the new RAS mutations [15].
Given that patients diagnosed with mCRC are
routinely tested for RAS mutational status, it is known
that 35-50% of CRC harbor RAS mutations [16]. RAS
testing has become mandatory for an appropriate
treatment decision. There are several methodologies for
RAS mutation detection with different advantages and
disadvantages.
Despite the promising advances that have been
made so far there is still a lack of a clinically-proven
circulating biomarker that can be used to guide patient
management [17]. To date, the follow-up of mCRC
patients has mainly been based on imaging techniques
(CT scan, PET, MRI etc…) and serum-based protein
biomarkers such as the carcinoma antigen-125 (CA125) and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The
main limitation in using these biomarkers is that they are
detectable also in healthy individuals (albeit at a lower
concentration) and thus they do not perfectly fit one of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Tissue DNA vs circulating DNA
DNA mutational analysis on formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tissue is nowadays a routine practice in
medical oncology. The identification of a specific tumor
genotype is mandatory for treatment decision and RAS
testing is always requested for mCRC patients.
Currently the evaluation of RAS mutational status
from FFPE is the only procedure recognized and accepted
in clinical practice. In the near future, we might witness
the introduction of ctDNA testing as a precise, efficient
and non-invasive technique for mutation detection both at
diagnosis and during subsequent follow-up.
Circulating free DNA may also have a diagnostic
value. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is released from both
healthy and cancer cells. Healthy cells are normally
destroyed through a regulated and orderly process; in
apoptotic cells DNA is uniformly truncated into 185- to
200-bp fragments. CfDNA released by necrotic cells,
and hence mainly tumor cells, varies in length. Thus
a preponderance of longer DNA fragments could be a
marker for tumor detection [22, 23]. The DNA integrity
index can be calculated as the ratio of longer to shorter
fragments. In 2006 Umetani et al. analyzed the DNA
Integrity Index (DII) in colorectal or periampullary cancer
[24]. The aim of the study was to evaluate ALU-repeats
fragments of different lengths by means of quantitative
PCR (qPCR). The short fragments (115bp) also represent
the total amount of circulating DNA whereas the long
fragments (247bp) are assumed to derive from necrotic
cells. The ratio of ALU247/ALU115 is defined as the
DII and was found to be significantly increased even in
24781

localized CRC and periampullary cancers. Recently T.B.
Hao et al. also demonstrated that DII evaluation might
be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostic
prediction of colorectal cancer [25] and the combination
with CEA could improve the diagnostic efficiency for
CRC. CfDNA concentration and DII are interesting
tools that might be valuable in the early complementary
diagnosis and monitoring of progression and prognosis of
CRC.
As previously mentioned, RAS testing in FFPE
tissue is considered a routine practice but it is nonetheless
challenging, mainly due to the DNA degradation that
occurs during fixation procedures. The analysis of FFPE
material gives a snapshot of the tumor in a specific
moment but it does not provide any information about
disease evolution or heterogeneity. ctDNA analysis offers
the challenging opportunity to follow tumor molecular
modifications over time and space. We can repeatedly

assess ctDNA at different time-points during treatment.
For metastatic patients, with multiple lesions, ctDNA is
composed of a mixture of DNA released from the different
lesions, and thus allows evaluation beyond the tumour
tissue heterogeneity, even though we might not be able to
detect exactly which lesions harbor a specific mutation.
It is known that KRAS mutations confer primary
resistance to anti-EGFR treatment, but it is still not clear
whether mutations in this gene are acquired after treatment
or are pre-existing at low levels in tumors with ostensibly
wild type KRAS genes. Diaz et al. in 2012 determined
whether mutant KRAS DNA could be detected in the
circulation of patients receiving monotherapy with antiEGFR drugs [26]. 38% of patients, whose tumors were
initially KRAS wild type, developed detectable mutations
of KRAS in their ctDNA. The mutations might presumably
arise in a small subclone population of cancer cells and
then expand under the pressure of the EGFR blockade.

Figure 1: Proposed flow-chart of RAS analysis with Melting curve test. After the diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer,

RAS analysis is always requested before treatment initiation. Melt-curve analysis allows a quick screening of all RAS mutations. If the
melting curve has a normal profile the sample can be reported as wild type and thus the patient can be selected for the specific targeted
treatments. If the melting curve is altered it is mandatory to proceed with other tests (either Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing), in order
to identify the mutation. If a mutation is detected the patient is subjected to standard chemotherapy (CT); in the opposite case (RAS wild
type) patients are selected for anti-EGFR treatment.

feasible and low time-consuming method for RAS
mutation testing. In addition the technique shows small
intra- and inter-lot deviations and a good concordance
among the different real- time PCR systems [29].
Real-time PCR methods are mainly based on two
principles: melt-curve and allele-specific PCR analysis.
The former allows obtainment of a quick screening of the
possible genetic variants present in the samples. The meltcurve analysis is based on the use of fluorescent probes
complementary to the target amplicon and it evaluates the
differences in the melting temperature needed to dissociate
probe from target [30]. Differences in melting temperature
are detected based on the loss of fluorescence as a function
of increasing temperature (Figure 1).
Conversely, allele-specific PCR allows the
identification of a specific mutation. It is based on the
use of oligonucleotide primers that specifically amplify
mutant versus wild-type sequences through the differential
binding and extension of the primer sequences to the
target template. A particular application of allele-specific
PCR is the so-called CAST-PCR (Competitive AlleleSpecific TaqMan PCR). Each mutant allele assay detects
specific or multiple mutant alleles and it is made up of:
an allele-specific primer that detects the mutant allele;
an oligonucleotide blocker that suppresses the wild type
allele; a locus specific primer; and a locus specific TaqMan
probe. This peculiar assay design allows the exquisite
amplification of the mutant allele thus increasing the

Low- vs high-sensitivity techniques
Sanger sequencing was previously the gold
standard methodology to detect KRAS mutations. This
technique has the advantage of being relatively cheap;
it is a reliable assay with good clinical applicability and
has a well-defined track record [27]. Furthermore it allows
the detection of all potential variations, including base
substitutions, insertions and deletions. Nevertheless the
biggest disadvantage of Sanger sequencing is its relatively
low sensitivity. This technique is rarely sensitive to mutant
allele frequencies of less than 10%, which correspond to
the threshold of 20% of tumor cells heterozygous for a
mutation [28]; it also requires a large amount of mutated
DNA relative to the normal DNA present in the sample.
Therefore in this case it is fundamental to carefully review
the material to ensure high tumor content. Nonetheless,
Sanger sequencing is still a useful technique for RAS
mutation testing, and most laboratories use Sanger
sequencing followed by pyrosequencing. This technique
is becoming more commonly used because of its high
analytical sensitivity, being able to detect less than 5% of
a specific mutation in a background of wild type DNA.
Real-time PCR has been suggested as a reliable,

sensitivity of the technique.
Due to the differences in terms of performance
between the various techniques, it may be recommended
to combine different assays in order to provide the best
means to assess clinical samples, particularly those that
have low tumor content or from which DNA quality may
not be optimal (Figure 2, Table 1).
Nowadays there is also a series of kits developed
by in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturers both for
research purposes and for use in clinical diagnostics.
For instance the TheraScreen® assay (DxS, Manchester,
UK), based on the amplification refractory mutation
system (ARMS) and Scorpion probes, is a CE-marked
kit that allows the detection and qualitative assessment of
KRAS gene mutations. Interestingly, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has approved the TheraScreen®
KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) to be
applied as a companion diagnostic test for Cetuximab

(Erbitux). This kit uses the Scorpions® and ARMS®
technologies and allows the detection of six mutations
in codon 12 and one in codon 13 of KRAS [31, 32].
Nevertheless the TheraScreen® kit does not detect
mutations in codon 61 of KRAS.

CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF RASRELATED PRIMARY RESISTANCE
Initial assessment of RAS mutational status, known
as extended assessment exons, is the key to be able to
define the best possible treatment for each mCRC patient.
In particular, it aids in making the right choice of first-line
chemotherapy regimen, since the presence of a possible
mutation allows identification of a group of patients who
would not obtain any benefit from the use of an anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody (moAb), cetuximab or panitumumab

Figure 2: Proposed flow-chart of RAS analysis with the combination of different techniques. After the diagnosis of mCRC,

firstly KRAS exon 2 (codon12-13) can be tested through allele-specific Real-Time PCR. This has a strong rationale since the majority of
RAS mutations fall into these codons. When a mutation is detected the patient is subjected to standard chemotherapy (CT). If no mutations
are detected it is requested to proceed with the analysis of KRAS exon3-4 and NRAS exon2-3-4 (all-RAS) through Sanger sequencing.
The results from this analysis may be: RAS mutated (standard CT); RAS wild type (target treatment), equivocal results. In the last case it
is advisable to proceed with pyrosequencing.

[2, 13, 33, 34].
This is to be considered as a fundamental step that
will affect subsequent lines of treatment and, ultimately,
progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS) of our patients. Of note, the need to obtain a rapid
reduction of the tumor mass represents a key point that
influences the choice of chemotherapy regimen. For these
reasons, clinical research through the study of molecular
genetics has produced numerous efforts in search of
predictors of response to various treatments. To date,
studies have produced evidence sufficient only as regards
RAS mutations, initially regarding codons 12 and 13 of
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. Regarding the G13D mutation,
16% of KRAS mutations, there are however conflicting
data [35, 36].
More recently the retrospective analysis of the
prospective phase III PRIME study, which randomized
KRAS wild type mCRC patients to receive first line
FOLFOX + panitumumab vs FOLFOX, demonstrated the
negative predictive value of mutations in exons 3 and 4
of KRAS and 2, 3, 4 of NRAS. Indeed, in KRAS mutant
patients the addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX seems
to have a detrimental effect on PFS (HR = 1:31; 95% CI:
1.07-1.60) and OS (HR = 1:21; 95% CI: 1:01 to 1:45).
Conversely, median OS was 25.8 mo vs. 20.2 mo (HR =
0.77; 95% CI: 0.64-0.94, P = 0.009) in all RAS wild-type
populations in favour of the combination of panitumumab
and FOLFOX [15, 37].
Similar results were obtained from the retrospective
analysis including extended RAS evaluation carried
out on phase III CRYSTAL and phase II OPUS studies,
which randomized patients receiving first-line cetuximab
in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX respectively.
In the CRYSTAL study no benefit was observed for the
experimental arm (FOLFIRI + Cetuximab) compared to
FOLFIRI alone in terms of RR, PFS and OS in the RAS
mutant subgroup, while the same analysis on all RAS wild
type patients showed an increase of 27.7% in response rate
(RR), an increase of about 3.0 months in median PFS, and
an increase of 8.2 months in OS [38, 39].
In the OPUS study, patients with any RAS mutation
(KRAS exon 2 + new RAS) received no benefit from
the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4; in some cases,
the addition of cetuximab showed a statistically nonsignificant trend to a worse outcome (ORR in RAS-mut
patients to FOLFOX4 + cetuximab 37% and to FOLFOX4
alone 51%; P = .087). No statistically significant
differences in median overall survival were observed
in patients with KRAS-WT or RAS-mut tumors when
cetuximab was added to FOLFOX4 [40].
The results of these first-line studies (CRYSTAL,
PRIME and OPUS), comprising the extended panel of
RAS mutations, have also demonstrated with greater
conviction the effectiveness of the addition of antiEGFR moAbs to, a standard chemotherapy regimen in
terms of PFS (11.4, 12.0, 10.1 vs. 8.4, 5.8, 7.9 months,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

respectively) and in terms of OS (28.4, 19.8, 26.0 vs 20.2,
17.8, 20.2 months, respectively). The unique role as a
negative predictor of response to anti-EGFR molecules
of RAS mutations has been further strengthened by the
final results of the TRIBE study, a prospective phase III
trial which randomly assigned patients, never treated for
advanced disease, to receive FOLFIRI + Bevacizumab
or FOLFOXIRI + Bevacizumab. The subgroup analysis
extended to not frequent RAS mutations showed in RAS
and BRAF wild-type patients a trend in favor of the tripletbased regimen in terms of PFS (13.3 vs 11.3 months) and
in terms of OS (41.7 vs 34.4 months). Of note, in the RAS
mutant population the results were very similar (12.0
PFS, OS 28.6 months) between the two treatment arms,
confirming the negative predictive role of RAS mutations.
On the contrary, these results seem to confirm the data on
the role of negative prognostic BRAF mutations (BRAF
wild type and mut OS 41.7 and 19.1 months, respectively,
in the arm containing the triplet) [41, 42].
In spite of the confirmed negative prognostic role
of BRAF mutations (8% of RAS wild-type), their role as
predictive of response to an anti-EGFR based regimen has
not yet been defined because of discordant outcomes from
frontline studies (CRYSTAL, PRIME and OPUS) and
other studies.
Expectations were high regarding the results
from two studies that compared head to head a first-line
treatment consisting of a chemotherapeutic doublet with
the addition of anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF mAbs. The
FIRE-3study, a phase III trial, compared FOLFIRI +
bevacizumab to FOLFIRI + cetuximab in a population of
KRAS exon 2 wild-type patients. In spite of a difference
in terms of RR, the primary endpoint of the study
was not highlighted in the primary analysis, and the
retrospective analysis extended to rare RAS mutations
showed substantial differences in terms of RR (72% vs
56.1%) in the cetuximab arm (p = 0.003). As regards
early tumor shrinkage (ETS), PFS in patients with ETS
in the cetuximab arm was 9.7 months vs 5.8 months in
patients with no-ETS. In the bevacizumab arm the PFS in
ETS patients was 11.7 months vs 8.3 months in non-ETS
patients, and finally deepness of response (DpR) correlated
significantly with OS and PFS (p = 0.0003 in KRAS exon
2 wild-type patients and p < 0.0001 in the final RAS wild
type population).
These important results were partially confirmed
by the data from the second phase III study, the CALGB
80405 trial, comparing patients for the KRAS wildtype exon 2 subjected to a combination regimen at the
discretion of the investigator (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI)
with the addition of an anti EGFR or anti-VEGF
moAbs. Also in this case, although the retrospective
analysis extended to rare mutations of RAS, there was
no significant difference between the two monoclonal
antibodies in terms of OS (32.0 vs 31.2). These data
suggest that both these are alternative treatments in this
24785

Oncotarget

setting. The analysis of RR emphasized a difference
in RR in favor of regimens containing the anti EGFR
(68.6% vs 53.6%) [43, 44]. Finally, the randomized phase
II PEAK trial, which compared FOLFOX+Panitumumab
with FOLFOX+Bevacizumab in wild-type KRAS exon 2
untreated patients, showed an improvement of PFS and
a trend towards improved OS in panitumumab-treated
patients. However these results are limited by the small
sample size [45, 46].
A recent meta-analysis evaluated data from nine
trials as regards KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors and other
RAS mutations (in exons 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons
2, 3 and 4 of NRAS) as predictive factors of primary
resistance. By pooled HRs no PFS or OS benefits were
observed when anti-EGFR moAbs were delivered to
patients with any RAS mutation. As a consequence all
these RAS mutations are deemed as negative predictive
factors [16].
In conclusion, the outcomes of all these analyses,
which include rare RAS mutations, do not give oncologists
a great deal of information on what is the best combination
regimen for mCRC patients. In the absence of significant
advantages in terms of OS, these new data regarding the
response rate associated with the initial clinical evaluation
of the patient may allow the construction of a treatment
algorithm to guide the choice of a combination regimen
in all RAS wild-type patients, with the addition of an antiEGFR moAb in case of highly symptomatic patients who
require a rapid reduction in tumor volume or, alternatively,
of a regimen containing an anti-VEGF moAb, which also
becomes the first choice of treatment in RAS mutated
patients or carriers of a BRAF mutation [34].

other malignancies, such as melanoma or NSCLC, the
most common reported mutation is V600E, accounting
for about 80% of all BRAF mutations in mCRC [49].
It consists of a substitution of valine with glutamate
at codon 600 on exon 15, resulting in a constitutive
activation of the RAF kinase and of the RAF–MEK–
ERK downstream signaling pathway, responsible for both
cancer cell proliferation and survival, independently of
the EGFR blockade [50, 51]. Much evidence suggests
that BRAF mutation is a strong negative prognostic factor
in mCRC patients, regardless of treatments received
[48, 52-58]. Although two meta-analyses have recently
shown a negative predictive value of BRAF mutations
for anti-EGFR treatment in mCRC [59, 60], their
potential application for clinical practice is still debated.
Retrospective studies have shown that the occurrence of
a BRAF mutation is significantly associated with inferior
outcomes in RAS WT, mCRC patients receiving antiEGFR therapy as second or subsequent lines of treatment.
Even if these data were not confirmed in the updated
analysis of the study of Peeters et al. [61], BRAF mutation
seems to be a negative predictor for anti-EGFR moAb
treatment in the chemo-refractory setting [48, 62, 63].
On the other hand, unlike RAS mutations, the predictive
value of B-RAF mutations in the first-line setting has not
been fully demonstrated. Some retrospective studies have
suggested that the BRAF mutation confers resistance to
anti-EGFR therapy [64, 65], while a retrospective analysis
of the COIN trial did not support the negative predictive
role of the BRAF V600E mutation [66]. A pooled analysis
including both CRYSTAL and OPUS trials retrospectively
investigated the efficacy of Cetuximab plus chemotherapy
in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients, according to BRAF
mutational status. The results of such analyses have shown
a significant benefit associated with the addition of antiEGFR to chemotherapy in the KRAS/BRAF wild-type
population, while the improvements in both PFS and OS
among the 70 KRAS wild-type / BRAF mutated patients
did not reach statistical significance, likely because of the
small size of the B-RAF mutant population included in
both the studies. Furthermore, B-RAF mutated patients
treated with chemotherapy alone also reported worse
outcomes compared with the B-RAF WT population,
suggesting a predominant negative prognostic value
of the B-RAF mutation [67]. The subgroup analysis of
BRAF mutations in both the phase III PRIME study and
FIRE-3 study, respectively comparing panitumumab plus
FOLFOX versus FOLFOX and Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI
vs Bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI as first-line treatment
for mCRC, also did not confirm the predictive value of
B-RAF mutations in this setting of patients [15, 68].
Recently, a prospective study evaluating the
predictive significance of the BRAFV600E mutation
in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients, in treatment with
anti-EGFR therapies, showed that patients with BRAF
mutated tumors have lower PFS and OS compared to

THE IMPACT OF OTHER PREDICTIVE
BIOMARKERS
As reported above, RAS mutations represent the
most important predictive biomarker of resistance to antiEGFR therapy in mCRC, and the only one approved for
clinical use. However mutant RAS only accounts for about
50% of non-responders to anti-EGFR therapy. Therefore
additional predictive biomarkers are needed in order to
better select those patients who may really gain benefit
from anti-EGFR treatments, and sparing others from a
futile treatment and related toxicities.

BRAF mutations
BRAF is a proto-oncogene localized on
chromosome 7 (7q34), encoding a serine-threonine
protein kinase, and is a member of the RAF subfamily
(together with the ARAF and RAF1 protein) which
directly interacts with RAS. Mutations of B-RAF are
reported in approximately 3-15% of mCRC and are
mutually exclusive with RAS mutations [47, 48]. As in

patients with BRAF WT. Such survival differences were
not statistically different in the first line-setting, while they
reached a significant relevance in second or subsequent
lines of treatment, according to previous evidence [69].
To date, the available data are insufficient to support the
use of BRAF mutations as clinical predictive biomarkers
for the upfront selection of mCRC patients, candidate
to anti-EGFR therapy, and their low prevalence further
limits their potential utility in clinical practice. However,
another study presented at the 2014 ASCO meeting
reported BRAF mutations in 11% of 37 mCRC patients
with acquired resistance to cetuximab-based treatment,
suggesting also a potential role in the development
of resistance during anti-EGFR therapy [70]. BRAF
mutations have also been detected noninvasively by ctDNA analysis at the time of progression in mCRC patients
who had previously responded to anti-EGFR therapy,
supporting the idea that such a mutation alone, or together
with other molecular alterations, such as RAS mutations,
may sustain the emergence of acquired resistance during
anti-EGFR treatments [17, 71].

708 mCRC chemo-refractory patients, under anti-EGFRtreatment, showed that exon 20, but not exon 9, mutations
of the PIK3CA gene were significantly associated with
lower RR, PFS, and OS, compared to a WT population.
Moreover exon 20 mutations were mutually exclusive
with KRAS mutations, whereas exon 9 mutations were
more often concomitant with KRAS mutated than KRAS
wild-type CRC [62]. Such evidence allows to explain
also the conflicting results of the two aforementioned
studies, which were both characterized by a significant
heterogeneity of the distribution of mutations in the two
different exons in the included cohorts. Indeed the study
by Sartore-Bianchi on PIK3CA mutated patients included
respectively 73% exon 20 and 27% exon 9 mutations,
compared to 13% and 78% exon 20 and 9 mutations
respectively, in the study by Prenen et al. Overall these
data suggest that PIK3CA exon 20 mutations may play a
role as predictive biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR
therapy in KRAS WT mCRC patients, as confirmed in
two recent meta-analysis [60, 76]. However, because of
its low frequency, further prospective studies are needed
to support the clinical utility of PIK3CA analysis in the
selection of those patients candidate to anti-EGFR therapy.

PIK3CA mutations

PTEN loss

PIK3CA is a proto-oncogene localized on
chromosome 3 (3q26.3), encoding the catalytic
(p110) subunit of the class IA phosphatidylinositol3kinases (PI3K). It is an intracellular lipidic kinase,
recruited by the EGFR tyrosine-kinase domain, able to
convert phosphatidylinositol- bisphosphate (PIP2) to
phosphatidylinositol-triphosphate (PIP3), and ultimately
responsible for the phosphorylation of AKT and the
activation of the downstream AKT-mTOR signaling
pathway, mediating both cell proliferation and survival
[72]. Somatic mutations of the PIK3CA gene are reported
in about 15-20% of CRC, and may co-exist with both
RAS and BRAF mutations [62, 73]. More than 80%
of PIK3CA mutations map to the exon 9 (60-65% of
mutations) and exon 20 (20-25% of mutations) hot-spots
[62, 74], leading to the constitutive activation of the PI3K
catalytic (p110) subunit and the downstream AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway, independently of EGFR blocking.
Some retrospective studies have investigated the potential
role of PIK3CA mutations as a predictor of resistance to
anti-EGFR treatments in mCRC patients, with conflicting
results. Sartore-Bianchi et al. showed that KRAS wildtype mCRC patients under anti-EGFR treatment whose
tumors harbored PIK3CA mutations had significantly
lower RR and PFS compared to a PIK3CA WT population.
Moreover all responders were found to be PIK3CA wildtype [75]. In contrast, Prenen et al. did not support a
significant difference in both RR and survival outcomes
between PIK3CA mutated and WT mCRC patients treated
with Cetuximab as monotherapy or in combination with
irinotecan, in second or subsequent lines of treatment [74].
Finally, a large retrospective European analysis, involving
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PTEN is a tumour suppressor gene, localized on
chromosome 10 (10q23.3), encoding a phosphatase
protein, which negatively regulates the PI3K-AKT
signaling pathway. Loss of the PTEN protein through
both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is reported in
about 20-40% of mCRC [77], resulting in a constitutive
hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway,
responsible for tumor cell proliferation and survival
[78]. Some studies have retrospectively investigated the
predictive value of PTEN loss in mCRC patients under
treatment with anti-EGFR therapy, reporting conflicting
and inconclusive results. Loupakis et al. have shown that
PTEN loss, detected by the IHC method, was associated
with lower responses, compared with PTEN positive
tumours of 102 chemo-refractory mCRC patients,
treated with cetuximab + irinotecan. However such
differences were significant in the metastatic lesions, but
not in the primary tumours, suggesting that, unlike RAS
mutations, PTEN expression may change over time [79].
Furthermore the analysis of survival outcomes, according
to PTEN expression in metastatic lesions, has also shown
a significant difference in PFS, in favor of the PTEN
positive cohort, while a significant improvement in OS was
observed only in PTEN positive, RAS wild-type patients.
Another study by Sartore-Bianchi confirmed a significant
association between PTEN loss and lack of benefit from
anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC patients, both in terms of RR
and PFS/OS. Finally a retrospective French study did not
show any differences in terms of RR and PFS, according
to PTEN expression, in a cohort of chemo-refractory, RAS

wild-type mCRC patients [64]. However, a significantly
lower OS was reported in the subgroup of PTEN negative
patients, compared to those with PTEN positive tumors,
suggesting a potential negative prognostic role of PTEN
loss. Even if a recent meta-analysis confirmed that PTEN
loss was significantly associated with lack of benefit to
anti-EGFR therapy in RAS wild-type mCRC patients, the
authors concluded that the predictive power of B-RAF
and PIK3CA mutations were stronger than PTEN loss,
not excluding that some patients with a single alteration
could still gain benefit from anti-EGFR treatment [60].
Therefore, larger and prospective clinical trials, including
a standardized method to detect PTEN expression, are
required to establish its potential role as a predictive
biomarker in RAS wild-type mCRC patients candidate to
anti-EGFR-therapy.

data indicate that the evaluation of the expression levels of
EGFR ligands could be a promising path towards a more
accurate selection of RAS wild-type patients to treat with
anti-EGFR drugs, but more consistent evidence is needed
to make this hypothesis part of daily practice.

HER-2 amplification
HER2 is a receptor that belongs to the ErbB family
and whose activation does not require the presence of a
ligand. Indeed it depends on the heterodimerization of
HER2 with other similar receptors of the family. A high
level of activation of HER2 can also be promoted by
gene amplification and subsequent HER2 overexpression
[85]. Preclinical evidence suggested a possible role of
the heterodimers of EGFR with other members of the
HER family, such as HER2 and HER3, in affecting the
efficacy of anti-EGFR based therapies. Two studies have
demonstrated a correlation between the amplification of
HER2 and the acquired resistance of mCRC to cetuximab
therapy (see below) [86, 87]. Recent retrospective
data confirm that the analysis by FISH of the HER2
amplification status could represent a promising way to
better identify subgroups of mCRC patients for treatment
with anti-EGFR drugs. Martin et al. evaluated HER2
gene status in 170 KRAS wild-type mCRC patients
treated with cetuximab or panitumumab identifying three
profiles: a) patients with no or slight HER2 amplification
(35%); b) patients with HER2 amplification in minor
clones or with increased HER2 gene copy number due to
polysomy (HER2-CNG) (61%); c) patients with HER2
amplification in all cells. The worst outcome was seen
in the group of patients with amplification in all cells,
while intermediate outcomes were seen for patients with
no amplification. Interestingly the best outcomes were
seen in the group of patients with amplification in minor
clones or polysomy. Authors explain these different
results supposing that tumors in the group with HER2
amplification in a minority of the cells or with HER2
polysomy may have a different pathogenesis linked to a
general chromosome instability. In the group with HER2
amplification in all cells however, HER2 activation can
bypass the blockade of EGFR mediated by panitumumab
and cetuximab, inducing a strong resistance to these
moAbs but placing the biological basis for anti-HER2
therapy in this group of patients. The lack of efficacy of
anti-EGFR treatment for the patients with no amplification
of HER2 has been related to kariotypic heterogeneity [88].
In a recently published work, Cushman et al. investigated
the expression of EGFR axis-related genes, analysing
103 tumor samples from the CALGB 80203 trial to
find prognostic or predictive markers for patients with
mCRC and treated with cetuximab and chemotherapy as
first line treatment: the expression levels of 14 EGFRrelated genes were correlated with clinical outcomes
(OS and PFS). Surprisingly, high mRNA levels of

AREG and EREG expression
The expression of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin
(AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) has been suggested as
a possible mechanism that could influence the response
to the anti-EGFR moAbs, cetuximab and panitumumab,
in mCRC patients. A high concentration of these ligands
is supposed to be related with a more aggressive tumor
growth, but the rates of KRAS mutations are lower in
tumors overexpressing EGFR ligands [80]. A retrospective
study evaluated AREG and EREG expression in 220
mCRC patients enrolled in clinical trials (EVEREST,
BOND, SALVAGE, and BABEL) [11, 81, 82]. The
analyses were performed on formalin-fixed paraffinembedded primary tumor samples through RNA
extraction and real time PCR. High levels of EREG have
been associated with a higher probability of objective
responses and the majority of patients with high levels of
EREG belonged to the group with complete and partial
responses. Moreover, high levels of EREG expression
in KRAS wild-type patients treated with irinotecan and
cetuximab conferred a benefit in PFS in comparison with
those with low ligand expression whose behavior was
similar to patients with KRAS mutant tumors [83]. A
recent study presented by J.F. Selingman et al. at the 2014
ASCO annual meeting evaluated the correlation between
the expression levels of both AREG and EREG mRNAs
in 323 RAS wild-type patients treated with irinotecan
as second line therapy, with or without Panitumumab
and enrolled in the randomized PICCOLO trial [63].
The results showed that the high level of expression of
the mRNAs of both ligands had a predictive value for
the RAS wild-type population demonstrating a benefit
in PFS for those patients treated with irinotecan and
Panitumumab versus irinotecan alone (mPFS 8.3 vs 4.4
months; HR: 0.62; 95% CI 0.49 – 0.78; p< .001), while
for RAS wild-type patients with low AREG and EREG
expression, no benefit was obtained. No prognostic
significance was found in terms of PFS or OS [84]. These

HER2 (HR=0.64) and epiregulin (HR=0.89) showed a
prognostic association with longer PFS for all patients
while a positive trend toward better OS was found for the
same genes in the overall population [89, 90]. Although
these data are preliminary and partially conflicting, they
confirm a potential role of HER2 overexpression in
guiding the response of tumors to anti-EGFR treatments.
At the moment, however, such evidence does not allow
definitive conclusions and prospective studies are needed
for this purpose.

The role of KRAS mutations in acquired resistance
to anti-EGFR moAbs was first reported by Bouchahda
et al. [99]. These authors published a case report of a
mCRC patient with a KRAS wild-type primary tumor
and synchronous metastases evaluated before beginning
treatment with cetuximab. However, after initial
significant tumor shrinkage on cetuximab and subsequent
progression, a segment hepatectomy allowed to evaluate
the mutational status of a metachronous liver metastasis.
They detected both codon 12 and 13 KRAS mutations.
These mutations are known to be very early events in
colorectal carcinogenesis. This observation is corroborated
by the findings of high concordance, about 90%, in
primary tumors and in metastases [79, 100-102].
For this reason it was argued that the onset of
new KRAS mutations could be a consequence of
clonal selection of cells early mutated in the KRAS
gene. This selection is the effect of selective pressure
by anti-EGFR moAbs. An alternative explanation is
represented by the development of novel spontaneous
mutations, maybe favoured by cytotoxic therapy. The
intratumor heterogeneity of the cancer cell population is
the better background for the genesis of potential drugresistant metastatic clones and it may also explain why
the mutations in these clones could be missed in DNA
detection in tumor samples[103, 104].
Further genomic alterations have been implicated
in acquired resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs in preclinical
studies [105]. Aberrant ERBB2 signalling, by ERBB2
amplification or heregulin production, seems to be
responsible for both intrinsic and acquired resistance in
cetuximab-treated mCRC patients. This ERBB2 signalling
impairment represents the activation of a bypass signalling
pathway. The aberrant activation of the ERBB2 gene leads
to persistent ERK1/2 signalling during treatment with
cetuximab, and subsequently the development of acquired
resistance to this agent. Of note, breast cancer cells
treated with the anti-ERBB2 moAb trastuzumab have an
activation of EGFR signalling as a mechanism of acquired
resistance. However this phenomenon is not observed for
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), which can inhibit both
EGFR and ERBB2 at clinically achievable concentrations
[86, 87, 106, 107].
The amplification of other genes was also observed
as a mechanism of de novo and acquired resistance. The
amplification of the KRAS gene is mutually exclusive
with KRAS or BRAF mutations. It induces overexpression
of the KRAS wild-type protein with changes of gene
expression similar to those caused by mutant KRAS
variants. However this genomic alteration was reported
in a small proportion of patients treated with anti-EGFR
moAbs, around 4%. Besides, KRAS amplification has
been shown to have a deterministic effect on anti-EGFR
resistance in in vitro studies. Indeed its occurrence in
sensitive cells favours resistance and its silencing restores
sensitivity [108].

PRECLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL
FINDINGS ABOUT RAS-RELATED
ACQUIRED RESISTANCE
Since anti-EGFR moAbs were introduced into
clinical practice for the treatment of mCRC, primary
resistance has been studied to select those patients
with higher probability of benefit. Concomitantly the
mechanisms of acquired resistance have been investigated
as cancer progression steadily develops during treatment
by these targeted agents.
Among the first investigations on acquired resistance
to cetuximab, Wheeler et al. examined the activity of 42
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in cetuximab-resistant cell
lines. They found high activity of EGFR, HER2, HER3
and cMET. This phenomenon seems to be mediated by an
overexpression of EGFR as a consequence of disregulated
internalization and degradation of EGFR, which
subsequently heterodimerizes with the other RTKs and
transactivates them. However HER3 activation appears to
be more crucial than the other RTKs in inducing acquired
resistance to cetuximab [91].
Cetuximab-resistant clones have a marked
nuclear expression of EGFR. This EGFR in the nuclear
compartment works as a transcription factor for cyclin D1,
iNOS, B-myb and Aurora kinase A, and phosphorylates
and stabilizes PCNA. The accumulation of EGFR in the
nucleus is favoured by several EGFR ligands, such as
EGF, HB-EGF, AR and β-cellulin. Src family kinase (SFK)
is a mediator of EGFR translocation, as its inhibition by
dasatinib may restore sensitivity to cetuximab [92].
Further in vitro studies on anti-EGFR-resistant cells
showed higher levels of phosphorylated EGFR, MAPK,
AKT and STAT3, which were associated with reduced
apoptosis [93]. Some preclinical studies on resistant cells
in xenograft models discovered a role of angiogenesis
dysregulation. Angiogenesis is an important determinant of
tumor progression, therefore new therapeutic approaches
are necessary to control angiogenic spread [94]. These
angiogenic mechanisms involved in resistance to antiEGFR agents include increased expression of VEGF and
other VEGFR-1 ligands. Despite this intriguing preclinical
evidence, phase III randomized trials did not find benefit
from combined inhibition of EGFR and VEGF pathways
[95-98].

Similarly MET amplification was found at high
levels in patients who progressed during treatment
with anti-EGFR therapy. In the same study other gene
copy number variations were not found, while the other
resistance-inducing oncogenes remained non-mutated.
Interestingly MET amplification can be detected in
circulating DNA over time. MET amplification was
found at low levels in tumor tissues before treatment.
As a consequence it could represent theoretically a
mechanism for de novo resistance. But the small amount
of MET-amplified cells can be expanded by the selective
pressure of anti-EGFR moAbs and they can induce
acquired resistance, as they become the leading tumor
cell population. This phenomenon has highly relevant
therapeutic implications, since MET is an actionable
target and MET inhibitors, such as crizotinib, are under
investigation [109].
A missense mutation in the EGFR extracellular
domain (S492R) was detected by sequencing analysis.
This mutation hinders cetuximab binding and it resulted
in the retention of EGFR activity during exposure to
cetuximab but not panitumumab. It was not detected in
tumor samples from untreated mCRC patients [110, 111].
A cross talk between EGFR and MET has been
shown. EGFR immunoprecipitated together with MET
in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer cells, and this
interaction was also observed in parental cells by TGFα
stimulation. This interaction between EGFR and MET
induces the activation of MET as a consequence of a
stimulation with ligands binding both receptors and has a
synergistic effect on the downstream effector of respective
pathways. Moreover TGFα plasma levels were higher
during treatment with cetuximab, even though they do
not influence tumor response. Accordingly, high TGFα
mRNA levels were significantly increased in patients
progressing during cetuximab treatment. Therefore the
overexpression of TGFα induces the interaction of EGFR
and MET, with subsequent phosphorylation and activation
of MET and its effectors. This mechanism could explain
the development of resistance to anti-EGFR agents and
it suggests to overcome this resistance by the combined
inhibition of EGFR and MET. Conversely high expression
levels of AREG and EREG ligands are related to a better
response to cetuximab [112-114].
More recently the paracrine secretion of EGFR
ligands has been implicated in the acquired resistance to
cetuximab. Some authors have suggested a “paracrine
in trans protection of sensitive cells by their mutated
derivatives”. According to this explanation, sensitive RAS
wild-type cells and resistant RAS-mutated cells cooperate
to develop the acquired resistance [115].
The downstream molecules in the EGFR pathways
have also been studied to explain the mechanisms of
acquired resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs. In addition to
the mutations in the genes involved in the same pathway
and the pathways cross-talking (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MET and HER2), a sustained activation of MEK and
ERK in terms of constitutive phosphorylation has been
implicated in acquired resistance. However the blockade
of MEK is not sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of
resistant cells. Only the concomitant blockade of EGFR
and MEK achieves a reversion of secondary resistance.
This evidence has been explained by the transient ERK
inactivation upon MEK inhibition, which leads to the
phosphorylation of EGFR. However a mechanism of this
EGFR feedback activation has not yet been found [71].
Accordingly, in another in vitro study the acquired
resistance was defined by the lack of blockade of MAPK
and AKT activation in spite of EGFR inhibition. In this
study the combined treatment with cetuximab and a
MEK1/2 inhibitor has a synergistic effect, as can be
verified by the inhibition of activated pAKT and pMAPK.
This inhibition leads to cell apoptosis as confirmed by
increased levels of cleaved PARP and caspase-3 activation.
MEK1/2 silencing restores the ability of cetuximab to
inhibit MAPK and cell proliferation [116].
All these studies led to the identification of possible
mechanisms to explain the onset of acquired resistance
to anti-EGFR moAbs in mCRC patients. Only a small
amount of genes appear to confer resistance. And this
observation is encouraging for attempting to overcome the
resistance. The new approach of liquid biopsy by cell-free
circulating tumor DNA allowed to monitor the appearance
of mutations of these genes in wild-type patients [17].
As a consequence of these findings a question
arises: how could gene mutations responsible for acquired
resistence to anti-EGFR moAbs emerge? Some studies
could provide an answer to this question. The study by
Diaz et al. provided further data about gene mutations in
circulating DNA. The authors developed a mathematical
model which led to the conclusion that these mutations
were present in expanded subclones prior to the initiation
of the anti-EGFR moAbs. The results of this analysis agree
with the in vitro study by Misale S et al., who continuously
treated colon cancer cell lines with cetuximab leading
to the emergence of resistant variants. The molecular
alterations, KRAS mutations and amplification identified
in resistant cells were also detected in a minority
population of parental cells. These results suggest that the
change from sensitive to resistant phenotype could derive
from selection of pre-existing resistant clones. However
a further experiment on sensitive cells, which were
confirmed to be wild-type by high-sensitivity analyses,
showed the appearance of KRAS mutation upon treatment
with increasing concentrations of cetuximab. Therefore
the resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs may also emerge
by ongoing mutagenesis. Further preclinical studies are
needed to explain these phenomena, but all these findings
helped to propose new treatment strategies to overcome or
prevent resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs in mCRC patients
[26, 117, 118].
It is usually thought that anti-EGFR moAbs work by

avoiding the activation of EGFR pathway by its ligands.
A significant apoptosis of tumor cells was not observed
by Cetuximab. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR have
not shown efficacy in colon cancer patients yet. Some
researchers hypothesized a role by antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [119, 120]. The binding of
the Fc region of a moAb to a Fc receptor expressed with
different patterns by cells of the innate immune system,
namely monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and
natural killer cells (NK). Cetuximab was able to mediate
NK-dependent ADCC in vitro, since NK cells are the main
mediators of the ADCC-dependent therapeutic effects by
cetuximab [121]. Instead, panitumumab is less effective
in inducing NK-dependent ADCC, maybe because IgG2
immunoglobulins have a reduced avidity for Fc receptor
in comparison with IgG1. It has been supposed that the
entity of ADCC in cancer patients treated with cetuximab
may help to predict tumor response. In colorectal cancer
cells KRAS mutations may interfere with ADCC activity.
Besides cancer patients may experience a lower induction
of ADCC by cetuximab in comparison with healthy
subjects as related to potential immunosuppression in
cancer patients [122]. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells
and other inflammatory cells could explain this limitation
of cetuximab-related ADCC.

CONCLUSIONS
The introduction of anti-EGFR moAbs in
combination with chemotherapy regimens for mCRC
patients improved OS and quality of life. Nowadays
these agents are the standard treatment for these patients.
However several clinical studies have highlighted the
predictive role of gene alterations involved in the EGFR
pathway. For each mCRC patient the analysis of these
biomarkers in tissue biopsy is mandatory to decide the
proper treatment. Until now many genomic alterations
have been identified. Among these biomarkers RAS
mutations in exon 2 and 3 are the most clearly defined
for clinical practice. The data for the other biomarkers,
including BRAF mutations, PIK3CA mutations,
PTEN loss, AREG and EREG expression and HER2 amplification, are still inconclusive or incomplete.
Further findings are emerging regarding the role of these
biomarkers as predictive for acquired resistance. Liquid
biopsy will help to identify and monitor the biomarkers
for both primary and acquired resistance. The application
of this new method will be granted by the validation of
high-sensitivity techniques for the isolation and detection
of somatic mutations in cell-free circulating tumor DNA.
Besides, it will allow to identify various mutations at the
same time. This opportunity will speed up the process of
patient selection for anti-EGFR moAbs.
