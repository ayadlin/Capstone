Abstract
Vincristine is a microtubule-destabilizing antimitotic drug
that has been used in cancer therapy for over 40 years.
However, the knowledge on vincristine-induced cell death
pathways is still sparse. Here, we show that vincristine induces
dramatic changes in the lysosomal compartment and sensitizes cells to lysosomal membrane permeabilization. In HeLa
cervix carcinoma cells, vincristine induced mitotic arrest and
massive cell death associated with an early increase in the
lysosomal volume and lysosomal leakage followed by the
activation of the intrinsic apoptosis program. In contrast,
the majority of vincristine-treated MCF-7 breast carcinoma
cells resisted apoptosis. Instead, they adapted to the spindle
assembly checkpoint and escaped the mitotic arrest as micronucleated and senescent cells with an increase in the volume
and the activity of their lysosomal compartment. Consistent
with its substantial effects on the lysosomes, vincristine greatly
sensitized cultured cancer cells as well as orthotopic breast
cancer xenografts in mice to the cytotoxicity induced by
siramesine, a sigma-2 receptor ligand that kills cancer cells by
destabilizing their lysosomes. Importantly, the combination
of nontoxic concentrations of vincristine and siramesine
resulted in massive cell death even in MCF-7 cells that were
capable of escaping vincristine-induced spindle assembly
checkpoint and cell death. Similar synergism was observed
when siramesine was combined with a semisynthetic vincristine analogue, vinorelbine, or with microtubule-stabilizing
paclitaxel. These data strongly suggest that combination
therapies consisting of microtubule-disturbing and lysosomedestabilizing drugs may prove useful in the treatment of
otherwise therapy-resistant human cancers. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells is composed of three major
protein families, intermediary filaments, actin filaments, and
microtubules that form filamentous structures throughout the
cell. The dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton consists of a- and
h-tubulin dimers (1). It is responsible for the transport and
positioning of intracellular organelles and the separation of
chromatids during the anaphase of mitosis (2, 3). If the dynamicity
of the microtubule network is compromised, cell division is

inhibited by the spindle assembly checkpoint (4, 5). Thus, it is not
surprising that microtubule-targeting compounds that either
destabilize (e.g., Vinca alkaloids) or stabilize (e.g., taxanes) the
microtubule network are among the most effective anticancer
drugs that are commonly used in the treatment of leukemias and
lymphomas, as well as in the combination therapies of several
nonhematopoetic cancers (6, 7).
Vincristine, a naturally occurring Vinca alkaloid, destabilizes
microtubules by binding to the Vinca domain in the h-tubulin
subunit (8). Low concentrations of vincristine deprive the
dynamicity of microtubules, whereas high concentrations lead to
a complete disassembly of the microtubule network (9). Consequently, no mitotic spindle can be formed, and cells are arrested in
mitosis by spindle assembly checkpoint (4, 5). Peripheral neuropathy is the main dose-limiting side effect of vincristine. It arises due
to the breakdown of transport lines in axons followed by their
degeneration (10). As an attempt to develop chemotherapy with
fewer side effects, several semisynthetic Vinca alkaloids with
varying affinities to tubulin isoforms have been developed. One
such compound is vinorelbine that binds axonal microtubules with
a weaker affinity than vincristine and therefore displays less
neurotoxicity (6). Another strategy to avoid the neurotoxicity is to
lower the dose of vincristine and combine it with other drugs. Due
to the limited knowledge of the cell death pathways initiated by
vincristine, the combination therapies used today may, however, be
far from optimal.
Continuous treatment with microtubule poisons leads either to
an execution of a cell death pathway directly from the mitosis or
to an escape from the mitotic arrest followed by cell division,
senescence, or delayed cell death (4, 5). The mechanisms coupling
mitotic arrest to subsequent death remains almost completely
unexplored. Because the microtubule cytoskeleton has an important role in the intracellular trafficking of organelles (e.g.,
endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes), interference with
its structure and dynamicity might also have lethal consequences
apart from those induced by the mitotic arrest. This hypothesis is
supported by the data showing that mitosis is not a prerequisite for
the cytotoxicity of the microtubule-destabilizing drugs as shown by
the above-mentioned vincristine-induced toxicity in postmitotic
neurons in vivo (6). Moreover, another microtubule-destabilizing
drug, colchicine, induces cell death in cultured postmitotic
cerebellar granule cells. In this case, the cell death is initiated by
the depolymerization of the microtubule cytoskeleton followed by
both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death
pathways (11). Thus, it is interesting to note that diminished
microtubule dynamicity induced by microtubule-stabilizing drugs
induces leakage of lysosomal protease cathepsins into the cytosol
and cathepsin-mediated cell death in non–small cell lung cancer
cells (12). These data suggest that lysosomal integrity relies on the
undisturbed microtubule network, and the question arises whether

the lysosomal destabilization could be a more common consequence of microtubule-targeting drugs.
Apoptosis is the best defined cell death program counteracting
tumor growth. It is characterized by the activation of a family of
cysteine proteases called the caspases that trigger apoptosisassociated morphologic changes such as the shrinkage of the cell,
the condensation of the chromatin, and the disintegration of the
cell into small fragments (13, 14). Most apoptosis pathways are
initiated by the up-regulation or posttranslational modification of
BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family. They then activate
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bak that induce the
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the release
of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome c facilitates
the assembly of the apoptosome, a multiprotein complex that
consists of Apaf-1, caspase-9, and cytochrome c, and serves as a
scaffold to activate caspase-9, which then activates the so-called
effector caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-7). Cancer cells frequently
harbor acquired mutations that allow them to escape spontaneous
and therapy-induced apoptosis (15, 16). For example, the upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and mutations in
the p53 tumor suppressor protein are common in human tumors.
Apoptosis-resistant cancer cells are, however, not completely
resistant to cell death, but can die via alternative cell death
pathways often involving non-caspase proteases such as lysosomal
cathepsins (17). Interestingly, transformation and tumor environment enhance the expression of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins and
increase their microtubule-dependent secretion into the extracellular space (18–20). These changes lead to the cathepsin-mediated
increase in angiogenesis and metastatic capacity, but also to an
increased susceptibility to the lysosomal membrane permeabilization. The cathepsins released to the cytosol upon lysosomal
membrane permeabilization can initiate the intrinsic apoptosis
pathway possibly via a cleavage-mediated activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bid and Bax (21, 22). Importantly,
cytosolic cathepsins can also trigger caspase-independent and Bcl2–insensitive apoptosis-like cell death pathways in apoptosisresistant cells (17). For example, siramesine, a sigma-2 receptor
agonist that is presently being developed as an anticancer drug,
destabilizes lysosomes and activates a caspase-independent cell
death that is insensitive to the antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-2 (23).
Siramesine is a highly lipophilic weak base (pK a f 9), and it
contains a protonable nitrogen suggesting that its anticancer
function may be due to its chemical nature as a lysosomotropic
detergent rather than binding to sigma-2 receptors1 (24).
Despite the long history of vincristine in cancer therapy, only
minor attempts have been made to clarify the intracellular death
pathway(s) it activates or the mechanisms by which some cancer
cells resist its toxicity. The requirement of intact microtubule
network for proper lysosomal function inspired us to study the
effect of vincristine on the lysosomal compartment in vincristinesensitive HeLa cervix carcinoma cells and relatively vincristineresistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Prompted by our data showing
that vincristine induced dramatic lysosomal changes in both cell
lines, we next studied the ability of vincristine and other
microtubule-targeting drugs to sensitize cells to drugs known to
induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Our data showing
the potent anticancer effects of the combination of microtubule-

disturbing drugs with siramesine both in vitro and in vivo open new
exciting possibilities for cancer combination therapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment. HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) cells were
kindly provided by J. Bartek (Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen,
Denmark). MCF-7 cell line used in this study is a subclone (MCF-7-S1) of
human ductal breast carcinoma cells originally selected for high sensitivity
to tumor necrosis factor (TNF; ref. 25). MCF-neo, MCF-vector, MCF-casp3,
MCF-Beclin-2, and MCF-Beclin-15 cells are single-cell clones of MCF-7 cells
transfected with an empty vector or plasmids encoding for human caspase3 (pcDNA-casp3) or FLAG-Beclin 1 (pCR3.1-FLAG-Beclin 1; kindly
provided by Beth Levine, Columbia University, New York, NY), respectively
(23, 26, 27). LC3-eGFP cells were created by transfecting MCF-7 cells with
pEGFP-C1 plasmid encoding for a fusion protein consisting of rat LC3 and
eGFP (kindly provided by G. Kroemer, CNRS-UMR8125, Villejuif, France)
by electroporation followed by single-cell cloning by limiting dilution. The
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax (Life technologies, Ltd.,
Paisley, United Kingdom) supplemented with 6% heat-inactivated FCS
(biological industries, Kib. Beit, Haemek, Israel), 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and in the case of transfected cells also with
400 Ag/mL geneticin sulfate (G-418; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cells
were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37jC, 5% CO2 and regularly
tested and found negative for Mycoplasma.
Siramesine was kindly provided by Christian Thomsen (H. Lundbeck A/S,
Valby, Denmark) and recombinant human TNF was provided by Anthony
Cerami (Kenneth Warren Laboratories, Tarrytown, NY). Vincristine, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO), z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fmk (zVAD-fmk) was from Bachem (Switzerland),
N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-aldehyde (ALLN) was from Calbiochem (San Diego,
CA) and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone was from Boehringer
Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany).
Viabililty and cell death assays. The viability of subconfluent cells were
analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) reduction assay as described previously (25). Apoptotic cells were
determined in an Olympus IX microscope with the UV channel by counting
condensed nuclei in cells stained with cell-permeable Hoeschst 33342
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. Cell membrane integrity was analyzed by
staining cells with 1 to 2 mmol/L SYTOX Green (S-7020; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) for 10 min and counting green nuclei in an Olympus IX
microscope. In both assays, three randomly chosen fields containing a
minimum of 100 cells were counted.
Protease activity measurements. The medium of the cells treated as
indicated in 24- or 96-well plates was removed, and 100 AL (96-well) or
200 AL (24-well) extraction buffer [250 mmol/L sucrose, 20 mmol/L HEPES,
10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and
1 mmol/L Pefabloc SC (pH 7.5)] containing 30 to 40 Ag/mL (cytoplasmic
fraction) or 300 Ag/mL (total cellular fraction) digitonin was added, and
plates were kept on ice with gentle shaking for 15 min. The enzyme
activities of the samples were determined as described previously using
zFR-amino-triflouromethylcuomarin (AFC) and DEVD-AFC (Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA) as substrates for cysteine cathepsins and
caspase-3–like caspases, respectively, and Spectramax Gemini fluorometer
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for the measurement of the V max of the
liberation of the antibody-forming cell fluorochrome (28). All protease
activities were normalized to the lactate dehydrogenase activity analyzed by
cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche) of the same sample.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells plated on glass coverslips or centrifuged
(600g for 5 min) on glass slides were washed and fixed in 4% formaldehyde
in PBS for 20 min at 25jC or in ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min.
Samples were permeabilized 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and blocked
with 20% FCS in PBS for 30 min. Antibodies used included human anti–atubulin (Molecular Probes), anti-human cathepsin L (Transduction
Laboratories, Lexington, KY), human anti–lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Bax (active conformation; Cell Signaling, Danvers,

Alexa-594–phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The samples were mounted with
antifade gold kit (Molecular Probes), and fluorescence images were taken
with Zeiss 510 laser-scanning microscope with Axiovert 100M.
Analysis of DNA content. Subconfluent cells were trypsinized, washed,
resuspended in 300 AL PBS + 3% FCS, and fixed by adding 800 AL ice-cold
methanol. After 30 min at 4jC, cells were washed in PBS + 3% FCS, suspended
in 200 AL staining solution (50 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 5 mmol/L MgCl2,
and 10 Ag/mL DNase-free RNase), incubated for 30 min at 37jC, and analyzed
by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Analysis of cytochrome c release. Cell membranes were permeabilized
by extraction buffer [250 mmol/L sucrose, 20 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L
KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1 mmol/L
Pefabloc SC (pH 7.5)] containing 150 Ag/mL digitonin for 15 min. Then cells
were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 25jC. Samples were blocked with 20%
FCS in PBS for 30 min and stained with anti–cytochrome c and Alexa-594–
coupled secondary antibody (both from Molecular Probes) in suspension
and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson).
Total volume of the acidic compartment. Cells plated in 24-well plates
(50,000 cells per well) and treated as indicated were incubated with 50 nmol/L
LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) for 20 min in 37jC. Thereafter,

Results
Vincristine induces apoptosis-like cell death in HeLa cells
and senescent-like morphology in MCF-7 cells. To elucidate the
mechanisms underlying vincristine-induced cytotoxicity, we com-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

pared the cellular responses of relatively vincristine-sensitive HeLa
cervix carcinoma and resistant MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines.
Vincristine reduced the density of HeLa cells at 25 nmol/L and
higher concentrations (IC50 = 50 nmol/L) and that of MCF-7 cells at
concentrations over 100 nmol/L (IC50 = 170 nmol/L; Fig. 1A). To
induce approximately similar antiproliferative effects in the two
cell lines, we then treated the HeLa cells with 100 nmol/L
vincristine for 24 h and the MCF-7 cells with 300 nmol/L vincristine
for 48 h. As expected, vincristine destabilized the tubulin network,
but not the actin network, in both cell types and arrested them in
the G2-M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1B and C). Interestingly, only
HeLa cells rounded up, detached, and presented with apoptosislike nuclear condensation, whereas most MCF-7 cells reattached
after the failed mitosis and remained viable with a flat senescentlike morphology and massive micronucleation (Fig. 1B and D and
data not shown).
Vincristine induces lysosomal changes in HeLa and MCF-7
cells. Because lysosomes and autophagosomes move along the
tubulin network (29–31), we next studied the effect of vincristine on
lysosome localization, volume, activity, and stability, as well as on

Vincristine Destabilizes Lysosomes

autophagosome number. As shown by confocal microscopy of cells
stained with an antibody to the lysosomal membrane protein 2
(LAMP-2), vincristine induced a dramatic increase in the size and
number of lysosomes in both HeLa and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A and B).
Accordingly, flow cytometry analysis of lysotracker-labeled HeLa
cells showed a significant increase in the total volume of the acidic
compartment upon vincristine treatment (Fig. 2C). To investigate
whether the increase in the volume of the acidic compartment
reflected increased autophagy activity in the cells, we visualized
autophagosome formation in MCF-7 cells stably expressing the
autophagosome-associated LC3 protein fused to the enhanced
green fluorescence protein (LC3-eGFP). Vincristine induced a
modest increase in LC3-positive vesicles, but these vesicles did
not colocalize with LAMP-2–positive lysosomes as was the case in
the cells treated with rapamycin, a well-characterized inducer of
autophagy (32, 33). Thus, the increases in the acidic compartment
and LAMP-2–positive vesicles are likely to reflect the increase in the
lysosomal volume rather than an accumulation of autophagolysosomes. Consistent with this hypothesis, vincristine also increased
the total cellular cysteine cathepsin activity in the MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 2D). However, the opposite was observed in HeLa cells, which
showed a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of cysteine
cathepsins, suggestive of lysosomal leakage of the cathepsins.
Indeed, vincristine induced a dose- and time-dependent lysosomal
membrane permeabilization as shown by an increase in the
cytosolic cysteine cathepsin activity and diffuse cathepsin L staining
(Figs. 2D and 3A). The lysosomal membrane permeabilization was
comparable to that induced by etoposide and paclitaxel, drugs that
have been reported to destabilize lysosomes (12, 34). In MCF-7 cells,
vincristine destabilized the lysosomes to a lesser extent, and this
effect was neither dose nor time dependent in the experimental
conditions used (Fig. 2D).
Vincristine induces the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in HeLa
cells. We next studied the ability of vincristine to trigger the

intrinsic apoptosis pathway by staining for the active form of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax and cytochrome c and by
measuring the effector caspase activity in the cell lysates.
Vincristine-activated Bax induced cytochrome c release from the
mitochondria to the cytosol and activated effector caspases in
HeLa cells (Fig. 3A–D). The number of the cells with activated Bax
and diffuse cytochrome c staining was, however, lower than
expected from the number of dying cells, and the activation of
effector caspases was only marginal as compared with etoposidetreated cells. Whereas 37% of HeLa cells treated with 100 nmol/L
vincristine for 24 h had condensed chromatin indicative of
apoptosis-like cell death (Fig. 1D), the same treatment failed to
activate effector caspases and induced Bax activation and
cytochrome c release only in 2.2% and 19.9% of the cells,
respectively. Caspase activation became evident at the later time
points, suggesting that it is rather a consequence than a cause of
the vincristine-induced cell death. Furthermore, the costaining for
cathepsin L and activated Bax revealed that lysosomal leakage
occurred before the Bax activation. None of the vincristine-treated
cells had activated Bax and vesicular cathepsin L staining, whereas
9.2% and 19.6% of the cells showed diffuse cathepsin L staining
while devoid of active Bax at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 3B).
MCF-7 cells do not express functional caspase-3 due to a 47-base
deletion within exon 3 of the CASP-3 gene (35). Thus, we tested
whether the lack of caspase-3 could explain the resistance of MCF7 cells to vincristine-induced apoptosis-like cell death. This was,
however, not the case because vincristine failed to activate the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway already upstream of caspase activation
as judged by the lack of activated Bax and diffuse cytochrome c
(Fig. 4A). Furthermore, ectopic caspase-3 failed to sensitize MCF-7
cells to vincristine, whereas it slightly increased the sensitivity of
the cells to TNF (Fig. 4B), which kills MCF-7 cells in a caspasedependent and Bcl-2–sensitive manner (25). MCF-7 cells also
harbor a monoallelic loss of the autophagy-associated tumor

suppressor gene BECN1 that encodes for beclin 1 protein (26).
Thus, we tested whether low beclin 1 levels and defective
autophagy could contribute to the vincristine resistance of the
MCF-7 cells. Ectopic beclin 1 had, however, no effect on the
vincristine response of the MCF-7 cells. The cells that expressed
ectopic beclin 1 and were sensitized to the autophagic cell death
induced by EB1089, a chemotherapeutic analogue of vitamin D
(27), responded to vincristine in a manner indistinguishable from
that of the vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 4C).
Microtubule-disturbing agents show potent synergism with
siramesine both in vitro and in vivo. Prompted by our data
showing that vincristine induces dramatic lysosomal changes also
in the relatively apoptosis-resistant MCF-7 cells, we next studied
the ability of vincristine to sensitize cells to drugs that induce
lysosomal membrane permeabilization. No increase in the
cytotoxicity was observed when MCF-7 cells were treated with
vincristine in combination with either cisplatin or etoposide,
whereas the combination with siramesine led to a synergistic
reduction in cell density (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the microscopic
analysis revealed that the combination of low concentrations of
vincristine and siramesine was not only cytostatic but triggered
massive cell death in MCF-7 cells that were resistant to the cell
death induction by vincristine alone (Fig. 5B and C). Vincristine
and siramesine showed strong synergistic cytotoxicity also in HeLa
cells, and similar synergism was observed both in MCF-7 and HeLa
cells when vincristine was substituted either by vinorelbine, a

semisynthetic vincristine analogue, or a microtubule-stabilizing
agent paclitaxel (Fig. 5B and C).
We have shown earlier that p.o. administration of siramesine at
daily doses ranging from 30 to 100 mg/kg has potent anticancer
activity in orthotopic MCF-7 breast cancer xenograft model in mice
(23). To study the therapeutic potency of the combination of
vincristine and siramesine in this model, we treated mice that had
tumors with a diameter of 5 to 6 mm with suboptimal doses of the
two drugs (Fig. 6). Biweekly treatment with siramesine at 6 mg/kg
or a single i.v. administration of vincristine (30 Ag/kg) reduced the
tumor growth slightly, but failed to inhibit it. Remarkably, the
combination of the two treatments was significantly more potent
than either treatment alone, and no significant tumor growth was
observed in the mice treated with both drugs during the treatment
period (Fig. 6). Importantly, the mice showed no detectable side
effects during the therapy.

Discussion
Compounds that disrupt the function of the microtubule
network form an important and expanding group of chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. A better understanding of the
cell death pathways they activate is essential to their use,
particularly with regard to their optimal exploitation in combinatorial cancer chemotherapy. The data presented above introduce
the lysosomes as targets of vincristine treatment. First, vincristine
triggered an increase in the size of individual lysosomes and the
total volume of the lysosomal compartment both in vincristinesensitive HeLa cells and in relatively vincristine-resistant MCF-7
cells. Second, vincristine-induced apoptosis-like death of HeLa cells
was preceded by lysosomal membrane permeabilization and
appearance of active cysteine cathepsins in the cytosol. Most
importantly, vincristine and siramesine, a sigma-2 ligand that kills
cancer cells by destabilizing their lysosomes, acted synergistically.
The combination of subtoxic concentrations of the two drugs
resulted in dramatic cytotoxicity even in the relatively resistant
MCF-7 cells.
Lysosomes are highly dynamic cytosolic organelles that receive
membrane traffic input from the biosynthetic (trans-Golgi
network), endocytic, and autophagic pathways (36). The increase
in the size of the lysosomal compartment observed in vincristinetreated cells is not likely to be due to increased de novo synthesis
of lysosomes via the biosynthetic pathway, because intact
microtubule network is essential for the maintenance and
function of the Golgi complex (37). Accordingly, the Golgi
apparatus was completely fragmented and dispersed throughout
the cytosol in vincristine-treated cancer cells used in this study
(data not shown). Microtubules have also been suggested to be
essential for the endocytic and autophagic pathways of membrane
traffic (30, 31, 37, 38). Akin to vincristine-treated MCF-7 cells that
showed a moderate accumulation of autophagosomes, vinblastine,
another natural Vinca alkaloid, has been reported to increase the
number of autophagosomes in other cell types. This accumulation
has been viewed as a failure in the fusion of autophagosomes with
the lysosomes (30), accelerated rate of autophagosome formation
(38), or a combined effect of both mechanisms (31). Our data
showing the lack of colocalization of the lysosomal marker
(LAMP-2) with the LC3-positive autophagosomes in vincristinetreated cells (as compared with rapamycin-treated cells) supports
the hypothesis that the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes
depends on intact microtubule network. Taken together, these

data suggest that the increased volume of the lysosomal
compartment does not reflect increased synthesis of the
lysosomes by the classic routes. Instead, the vincristine-induced
increase in the lysosomal volume could be a result of the merging
of preexisting lysosomes combined with their defective turnover
by exocytosis and/or autophagy. Accordingly, lysosomal exocytosis
has been shown to depend on intact microtubules in hepatocytes
and lymphocytes (39, 40).
Vincristine-induced destabilization of lysosomes was preceded
by an accumulation of large lysosomes in MCF-7 and HeLa cells.
Thus, it is interesting to note that an increase in lysosome size has
been reported to correlate with their decreased stability and
sensitization to nonapoptotic cell death pathways in other cell
types (41). Accordingly, nontoxic concentrations of vincristine
dramatically sensitized HeLa and MCF-7 cells to lysosomedestabilizing siramesine both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly,
the semisynthetic Vinca alkaloid vinorelbine, which is better
tolerated than vincristine, and broadly used microtubule stabilizer
paclitaxel showed similar synergism when combined with siramesine. These data indicate that impairment of microtubule dynamics
is enough to sensitize cancer cells and tumors to siramesine.
Siramesine is a lipophilic sigma-2 receptor agonist that accumulates in the lysosomes and kills cancer cells by destabilization of
their lysosomes in a Bcl-2–insensitive manner1 (23). Therefore,
the increased volume and decreased stability of lysosomes in
vincristine-treated cells might explain the synergism observed
between vincristine and siramesine. Alternatively, defect autophagy
in vincristine-treated cells could contribute to the sensitization. We
have recently shown that siramesine-induced cell death is
accompanied by an induction of massive autophagy that serves a

cytoprotective function.1 g-Irradiation and arsenic trioxide have
been suggested to trigger similar cytoprotective autophagy in
parallel with their cytotoxic effect (42, 43). Thus, combination
therapies between these treatments and microtubule-disturbing
drugs may also prove efficient.
Vincristine-treated HeLa and MCF-7 cells displayed radically
different morphologies. HeLa cells died within 48 h, and the cell
death was accompanied by a G2-M cell cycle arrest, lysosomal
membrane permeabilization, Bax activation, cytochrome c release,
effector caspase activation, and apoptosis-like chromatin condensation. Bax activation and cytochrome c release, hallmarks of the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway, occurred only in a minority of dying
cells, and the level of effector caspase activation was very low as
compared with etoposide-treated apoptotic HeLa cells. Furthermore, these apoptosis-associated changes occurred late in the
process, and an analysis at a single cell level revealed that Bax was
activated only in cells that had undergone lysosomal membrane
permeabilization. Thus, the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis
pathway seemed to be a secondary event rather than the main cell
death pathway in vincristine-treated HeLa cells. Instead, the
substantial release of cathepsins into the cytosol early in the
process suggests that the lysosomal membrane permeabilization is
involved in this cell death pathway. Due to a high sensitivity of
HeLa cells to protease inhibitors, we were unfortunately unable to
define the role of individual lysosomal proteases in this process.
Contrary to the HeLa cells that detached and died, vincristinetreated MCF-7 cells adapted to the mitotic arrest, reattached to the
bottom of the culture wells after a failed mitosis, and stayed viable
with metabolic activity and intact plasma membrane for several
days. These micronucleated cells displayed a senescent flat

inhibits the growth of orthotopic breast cancer xenografts in mice. A total of

morphology and enlarged lysosomal compartment, but showed no
signs of apoptosis. There might be several reasons why MCF-7 cells
are more resistant to vincristine-induced cell death than HeLa
cells. They could, for example, express tubulin isoforms that have
low affinity for vincristine (44); microtubule-stabilizing, microtubule-associated proteins that antagonize tubulin depolymerization

(45); or multidrug resistance–associated proteins that inhibit the
uptake of the drug (46, 47). Whereas these explanations may clarify
the higher IC50 of vincristine in MCF-7 cells, they do not fully
explain the different responses observed because the concentrations of vincristine used in this study effectively induced G2-M
arrest both in MCF-7 and HeLa cells. The micronucleated 4N
nuclei in MCF-7 cells revealed that they had escaped mitosis
without satisfying spindle assembly checkpoint (48, 49). For
instance, AuroraA kinase can override this checkpoint, and it has
been reported to protect other cell types against taxol (50).
Another possibility is that MCF-7 cells fail to initiate the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway in response to the checkpoint, for example, due
to the lack of functional CASP-3 gene (35). However, the
reintroduction of caspase-3 did not increase the death rate or
change the morphology of the cells.
Overall, our study shows that vincristine affects the lysosomal
compartment in HeLa and MCF-7 cells with regard to lysosomal
size and integrity, and that vincristine, as well as other
microtubule-disturbing drugs, possess great future potential as
parts of a combination therapies with lysosome-targeting drugs
even in tumors with defective spindle assembly checkpoint.
