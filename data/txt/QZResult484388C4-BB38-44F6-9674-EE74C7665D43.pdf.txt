ABSTRACT
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood with a
poor prognosis, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. Here we identify
a synergistic interaction of the second-generation histone deacetylase inhibitor
(HDACI) JNJ-26481585 and common chemotherapeutic drugs (i.e. Doxorubicin,
Etoposide, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide and Actinomycin D) to trigger apoptosis
in RMS cells. Importantly, JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin cotreatment also significantly
suppresses long-term clonogenic survival of RMS cells and tumor growth in vivo in
a preclinical RMS model. Mechanistically, JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin cotreatment
causes upregulation of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Noxa as well as downregulation
of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. These changes in the ratio of proand antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins contribute to JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-mediated
apoptosis, since knockdown of Bim or Noxa significantly inhibits cell death. Also, JNJ26481585 and Doxorubicin cooperate to stimulate activation of Bax and Bak, which
is required for JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, since silencing of Bax
or Bak protects against apoptosis. Consistently, overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly
reduces JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis. JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin
cotreatment leads to caspase activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis, since the
broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone
(zVAD.fmk) rescues cells from apoptosis. In conclusion, the second-generation HDACI
JNJ-26481585 cooperates with chemotherapeutics to engage mitochondrial apoptosis
in RMS cells, demonstrating that JNJ-26481585 represents a promising strategy for
chemosensitization of RMS.

INTRODUCTION

to develop new treatment regimens in RMS to improve
the poor prognosis of these patients. Since conventional
therapies with common chemotherapeutics have already
been optimized in recent years, new experimental
therapies seem to be necessary to improve the outcome of
RMS patients, especially with high-risk disease.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) determine the
acetylation status of histones, thereby affecting chromatin
topology and gene expression [4]. In addition to histones,
HDACs are also able to interact and deacetylate nonhistone proteins, thereby affecting their activity,

RMS is one of the most common soft-tissue
sarcomas in children, which comprises two major
subtypes, i.e. alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS)
and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) [1, 2].
Despite multimodal treatment regimens and advances
in combination chemotherapy, patients with primary
metastatic disease or relapse are largely resistant to current
treatment protocols and have a dismal chance for cure of
less than 20% [3]. This highlights the high medical need

RESULTS

localization or interaction with other proteins [4]. Since
HDACs have been shown to be upregulated in many
cancer entities, they are considered to represent potential
targets for treatment strategies [5, 6]. As a relatively new
class of anticancer agents, HDACIs have been shown to
induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells [7].
HDACIs are able to engage cell death mainly via the
two well-described apoptotic pathways, i.e. the extrinsic
(death receptor) pathway and the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathway, which both result in the activation of caspases
[8]. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP) constitutes a central event in the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis and is tightly controlled by several
pro- and antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family [9].
This includes on the one side antiapoptotic proteins
(e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) and on the other side
proapoptotic members such as BH3-only proteins (e.g.
Bim, Noxa and Bmf) and the multidomain proteins Bax
and Bak [10]. MOMP involves activation of Bax and Bak
as pore-forming proteins in the mitochondrial membranes,
which results in the release of proteins from the
mitochondrial intermembrane space including cytochrome
c. In the cytosol, cytochrome c promotes the formation
of the apoptosome leading to activation of caspases and
apoptotic cell death [9].
JNJ-26481585 (Quisinostat) is a new secondgeneration, pyrimidyl-hydroxamic acid HDACI, which
has a high potency towards class I and II HDACs [11].
JNJ-26481585 showed antitumor activity in patients with
advanced solid tumors [11, 12] and in mouse models of
multiple myeloma with almost complete reduction of
tumor burden [13]. JNJ-26481585 has been documented
by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program to exhibit
improved efficiency compared to common HDACIs,
e.g. SAHA (Vorinostat), underscoring that it represents
a promising new agent for the treatment of childhood
cancers including RMS [14]. Since chemotherapy is
a central pillar of current treatment protocols for RMS,
anticancer drugs are prime candidates for rational
combinations with JNJ-26481585. However, so far it is
not known whether or not JNJ-26481585 can be used to
increase chemosensitivity of RMS cells. Therefore, the
current study aims at investigating the question whether
JNJ-26481585 sensitizes RMS cells for chemotherapyinduced cell death and at understanding the underlying
molecular mechanisms of action.

JNJ-26481585 synergizes with clinically used
chemotherapeutic drugs to induce apoptosis in
RMS cells
To address the question whether JNJ-26481585
can increase chemosensitivity of RMS cells, we tested
the effects of JNJ-26481585 alone and together with
chemotherapeutic drugs that are commonly used in
clinical trial protocols for the treatment of RMS [15]. We
assessed apoptosis by analysis of DNA fragmentation as
a characteristic marker of apoptotic cell death in RMS
cell lines comprising both the ERMS (RD, TE381.T) and
ARMS (Rh30, RMS13) subtypes. Importantly, suboptimal
concentrations of JNJ-26481585 synergized with various
anticancer drugs, including the topoisomerase II inhibitors
Doxorubicin and Etoposide, the vinca alkaloid Vincristine,
the alkylating agent Cyclophosphamide and the cytotoxic
antibiotic Actinomycin D, to trigger apoptosis in RMS
cells as confirmed by calculation of (CI), while treatment
with JNJ-26481585 alone induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1A-1E, suppl. Figure 1).
Concomitant analysis of the acetylation status of histone
H3 confirmed that JNJ-26481585 increased histone H3
acetylation under these conditions (Figure 1F). Compared
to RMS cells, we observed no additive cytotoxicity of
JNJ-26481585 together with Doxorubicin or Etoposide
against fibroblasts (Suppl. Figure 2), pointing to some
tumor selectivity.
We additionally analyzed SYTOX® Blue-stained
nuclei in Rh30 cells as another marker of cell death.
Combined treatment or Rh30 cells with JNJ-26481585
and Doxorubicin significantly increased the percentage
of SYTOX® Blue-positive cells (Suppl. Figure 3A).
Pharmacological rescue experiments showed that addition
of the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk, but not
the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitor
Necrostatin-1s significantly inhibited JNJ-26481585/
Doxorubicin-induced cell death (Suppl. Figure 3B),
underscoring that JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin cotreatment
triggers apoptotic cell death. This set of experiments
demonstrates that JNJ-26481585 sensitizes RMS cells for
several clinically used chemotherapeutic agents.

After this initial screening for synergistic drug
interactions, we focused our subsequent studies on
JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin cotreatment, since this
combination turned out to be very potent and since

A.-E., Cells were treated with 15 nM JNJ-26481585 and/or indicated concentrations of Doxorubicin A., Etoposide B., Vincristine C.,
Cyclophosphamide D. or Actinomycin D E. for 48 hours A.-D. or 72 hours E. Apoptosis was determined by analysis of DNA fragmentation
of PI-stained nuclei using flow cytometry. Mean and SD of three experiments performed in triplicate are shown; *P ˂ 0.05, **P ˂ 0.01.

Doxorubicin is often clinically used. To explore whether
the cotreatment with JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin has an
influence on long-term clonogenic survival of RMS cells,
we performed colony assays. Notably, the combination
of JNJ-26481585 and Doxorubicin significantly reduced
colony formation of RMS cells compared to treatment
with either agent alone (Figure 2A).
To assess the antitumor activity of JNJ-26481585/
Doxorubicin cotreatment against RMS in vivo, we
used the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model that
has successfully been employed in the past to test the
anticancer effects of experimental compounds [16-18] and
that proved to represent a suitable preclinical RMS model
yielding comparable results to xenograft mouse studies
[19]. In this model, we implanted RMS cells onto the CAM
of chicken embryos, allowed the cells to form tumors and
treated them with JNJ-26481585 and Doxorubicin on three
consecutive days. On day four, tumors together with the
surrounding CAM were sampled for assessment of tumor
growth. Importantly, cotreatment with JNJ-26481585/
Doxorubicin significantly reduced tumor growth (Figure
2B). Together, these findings show that JNJ-26481585/

Doxorubicin cotreatment suppresses clonogenic survival
and tumor growth in vivo in preclinical RMS models.

JNJ-26481585 and Doxorubicin cooperate to
induce caspase activation and caspase-dependent
apoptosis
To gain insights into the underlying molecular
events of the observed JNJ-26481585-mediated
chemosensitization, we monitored activation of caspases
known as key mediators of apoptosis. To this end, we
analyzed cleavage of caspases into their active fragments
by Western blotting. Notably, JNJ-26481585 and
Doxorubicin acted together to trigger cleavage of caspase-8
into active p43/p41 fragments, cleavage of caspase-9 into
active p37/p35 fragments, cleavage of caspase-3 into
active p17/p12 fragments and cleavage of poly ADP ribose
polymerase 1 (PARP) into p89 fragment (Figure 3A). A
kinetic analysis revealed that this concerted action of JNJ25481585 and Doxorubicin to trigger caspase activation
occurred at the onset of apoptosis and that the rate of
apoptosis upon JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin cotreatment

when cell viability was determined by two distinct assays,
i.e. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay and crystal violet assay, since
zVAD.fmk significantly rescued cells from JNJ-26481585/
Doxorubicin-imposed loss of cell viability (Figure 3D,

JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin cotreatment shifts the
balance of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins

upon JNJ-264815/Doxorubicin cotreatment.
To investigate the relevance of Bim and Noxa in
JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-mediated cell death, we
genetically silenced each gene using two distinct siRNA
oligonucleotides. Importantly, individual silencing of
Bim or Noxa, which was demonstrated by Western blot
analysis (Figure 4C and 4D, upper panels), significantly
impeded JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-induced cell death
(Figure 4C and 4D, lower panels). Together, these results
demonstrate that the BH3-only proteins Bim and Noxa are
necessary for JNJ-26481585-induced cell death.

Next, we investigated the effect of JNJ-26481585
and Doxorubicin on expression levels of pro- and
antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which are
known as key regulators of apoptosis. Treatment with
JNJ-26481585- or JNJ-26481585/ Doxorubicin resulted
in upregulation of BimEL and of Bmf in Rh30 cells
(Figure 4A). In addition, Noxa expression increased at
early time points upon cotreatment with JNJ-26481585
and Doxorubicin (Figure 4B). Also, JNJ-26481585 and
Doxorubicin cooperated to reduce protein levels of Mcl-1
and Bcl-xL (Figure 4A). These findings were confirmed
in another RMS cell line (Suppl. Figure 4) and point to a

Bax and Bak by conformation-specific antibodies, since a

been reported to impair mitochondria-mediated apoptotic
signaling events [9]. Ectopic expression of murine Bcl2 was confirmed using an antibody that specifically
detects the ectopically expressed murine Bcl-2 (Figure
6A). Importantly, overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly
reduced JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-induced DNA
fragmentation as well as loss of cell viability (Figure
6B and 6C). Also, Bcl-2 overexpression abolished JNJ26481585/Doxorubicin-stimulated activation of Bax

notion that JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis
depends on intact signaling via the mitochondrial pathway
of apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

RMS cells for apoptosis induced by several anticancer
drugs, which are commonly used in the clinic for the
treatment of RMS, including Doxorubicin, Etoposide,
Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide and Actinomycin D
[15], thus underscoring the clinical relevance of this
chemosensitization. In contrast to RMS cells, JNJ26481585 does not enhance the cytotoxicity of anticancer
drugs such as Doxorubicin or Etoposide against nonmalignant fibroblasts, pointing to some tumor selectivity.
Importantly, the combination of JNJ-26481585 and
Doxorubicin significantly suppresses tumor growth in
a preclinical in vivo model of RMS and inhibits longterm clonogenic growth of RMS cells. While we used
co-treatment with JNJ-26481585 and Doxorubicin to
identify synergistic drug interactions, it remains subject to
further studies to explore the effects of different treatment
schedules on synergism.
Mechanistic studies revealed that the synergism
of JNJ-26481585 and Doxorubicin involves cooperative
induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, as
demonstrated by several lines of evidence. First, activation
of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is demonstrated
by the following typical parameters. JNJ-26481585

In recent years, there has been a growing interest
in using HDACIs for the treatment of cancers including
pediatric malignancies such as RMS. Of note, HDACIs
as a class turned out to be active against RMS cells
in a recent screen of a custom library of about 200
compounds including chemotherapeutics, Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs and small molecules
with biological activity [22]. Furthermore, Vorinostat is
currently being evaluated in early clinical trials for the
treatment of childhood cancers including RMS [23].
The second-generation HDACI JNJ-26481585 has been
documented to exhibit improved pharmacodynamic
properties over other HDAC inhibitory compounds,
demonstrating sustained histone acetylation in tissues and
tumors [11]. Against this background, we investigated
the question whether JNJ-26481585 could be employed
to enhance the sensitivity of RMS cells towards
chemotherapeutics.
In this study, we identify the synergistic interaction
of JNJ-26481585 together with chemotherapeutic agents
to trigger apoptosis in RMS cells. JNJ-26481585 sensitizes

MATERIALS AND METHODS

and Doxorubicin act in concert to shift the ratio of proand antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in favor of apoptosis,
thereby facilitating the activation of the mitochondrial
gatekeeper proteins Bax and Bak, which in turn leads to
activation of caspases and DNA fragmentation. Caspasedependent apoptosis was confirmed by experiments using
the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk, which
significantly rescues JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis. Second, rescue experiments demonstrate that
the BH3-only domain proteins Bim and Noxa as well as
the multidomain proteins Bax and Bak are required for
apoptosis, since individual silencing of Bim, Noxa, Bax
or Bak significantly impedes JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicininduced apoptosis. Third, JNJ-26481585/Doxorubicin
cotreatment causes downregulation of the antiapoptotic
proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, which is in line with previous
reports showing that HDACIs can also downregulate
gene expression levels [8]. Fourth, ectopic expression of
Bcl-2, which is known to impede mitochondria-mediated
apoptotic signaling events, significantly rescues JNJ26481585/Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Together,
these mechanistic studies emphasize the critical role of
the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway for JNJ-26481585/
Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. In line with this notion,
JNJ-26481585 has previously been described to act by
downregulation of Mcl-1 and upregulation of Bid and Bim
cells in multiple myeloma cells [24].
It has been shown before that HDACIs
predominantly act by inducing apoptosis, either by the
extrinsic or the intrinsic apoptotic pathway depending on
the context [8]. We recently reported that Vorinostat, a firstgeneration HDACI, is able to sensitize RMS and Ewing
sarcoma towards classical chemotherapeutics, especially
Doxorubicin and Etoposide [25, 26]. However, nothing
is known so far on rational combination therapies using
the second-generation HDACI JNJ-26481585 in RMS.
JNJ-26481585 represents a promising compound to target
HDACs in pediatric cancers, since it has been reported
to retard tumor growth in the majority of solid pediatric
xenografts studied [14], whereas Vorinostat induced no
objective responses among 30 evaluable solid childhood
tumor xenografts [27]. Our study demonstrates for the
very first time that JNJ-26481585 primes RMS cells for
anticancer drug-triggered apoptosis. Since chemotherapy
represents a central element of current treatment protocols
for RMS [15], this synergistic interaction is of special
interest for future clinical translation. Thus, this study
provides an important rationale to transfer combinations of
JNJ-26481585 together with anticancer drugs into clinical
application for the treatment of RMS.

5-((7-Cl-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-methylimidazolidine2,4-dione) (7-Cl-O-Nec-1, Nec-1s) from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany), JNJ-26481585 from Selleck
Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA), and all other chemicals
from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) unless indicated
otherwise.

Determination of cell viability, apoptosis and
clonogenic growth
For determination of cell viability and apoptosis
cells were seeded at 0.3 x 105 cells/cm2. Cell viability was
determined by MTT assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
or by crystal violet assay by staining viable cells with
crystal violet solution (0.5% crystal violet, 30% ethanol,
and 3% formaldehyde). Apoptosis was determined by
flow cytometric analysis (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany) of DNA fragmentation of
propidium iodide (PI)-stained nuclei as described
previously [28]. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 24well plate, allowed to settle overnight and treated with
indicated drug concentrations. After indicated treatment
times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended
in a buffer containing 0.05% trisodium citrate dihydrate
pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 50 µg/ml PI), incubated at
4°C and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry.
In addition, apoptosis was assessed by SYTOX® Bluestained nuclei according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Life Technologies, Inc.). To determine colony formation,
200 cells were seeded in a 6-well tissue culture plate,
allowed to settle overnight and treated with 7.5 nM JNJ26481585 for 23 hours before 0.015 µg/ml Doxorubicin
was added for 1 hour. Then, medium was exchanged and
colonies were stained after 12 days with crystal violet
solution. To analyze cooperative drug interaction, drug
concentrations and treatment duration were modified for
colony formation assay due to the prolonged assay period
and the reduced initial cell density. Colonies containing
more than 50 cells were counted and the percentage of
surviving colonies relative to solvent-treated controls was
calculated.

Calbiochem) and 10 µl pan-mouse IgG Dynabeads (Dako,
Hamburg, Germany) and washed with CHAPS buffer. The
precipitate was analyzed for Bax and Bak expression by
Western blotting using the Bax NT antibody (Merck) or
Bak antibody (BD Biosciences).

For Bcl-2 overexpression, Phoenix packaging cells
were transfected with 20 µg of murine stem-cell virus
(pMSCV, Clontech, Mountain View CA) vector containing
murine Bcl-2 or empty vector using calcium phosphate
transfection as described previously [25]. Stable cell
lines were generated by lentiviral transduction and were
selected with 10 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invitrogen).

CAM assay
CAM assay was done as described previously [29].
Briefly, 1 x 106 cells were implanted on the CAM of
fertilized chicken eggs on day 8 of incubation. The next
three days, cells were treated with 15 nM JNJ-26481585
and 0.25 µg/ml Doxorubicin. Four days after inoculation,
tumors were excised with the surrounding CAM, fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut in 3 µmsections and stained with 1:1 hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin
solution for histological analysis. Images were digitally
recorded with an AX70 microscope (Olympus, Center
Valley, PA, USA) and tumor area was analyzed by ImageJ
digital imaging software (NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA).

RNA interference
For transient knockdown by siRNA, cells were
reversely transfected with 10-20 nM SilencerSelect siRNA
(Life Technologies, Inc.), i.e. control siRNA (4390843) or
targeting siRNAs (s1880 and s1881 for Bak, s1888 and
s1890 for Bax, s195011 and s223065 for Bim, s10708 and
s10709 for Noxa) using Lipofectamine RNAi Max reagent
and OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Western blot analysis

Statistical analysis

Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [28] using the following antibodies: mouse
anti-caspase-8, mouse anti-Noxa, rat anti-Bmf (Alexis
Biochemicals, Grünberg, Germany), mouse anti-Bcl-2,
rabbit anti-Bcl-xL, mouse anti-Bax, rabbit anti-Bak
(BD Transduction Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany),
rabbit anti-caspase-3, rabbit anti-caspase-9, rabbit antiBim, mouse anti-PARP (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA),
acetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake
Placid, NY), rabbit anti-Mcl-1 (Stressgene, Victoria,
BC), rabbit histone H3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
Mouse anti-GAPDH (HyTest, Turku, Finland), mouse
α-Tubulin (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) or mouse
β-Actin (Sigma) were used as loading controls. Goat
anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) were used as secondary antibodies. Enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg,
Germany) or infrared dye-labeled secondary antibodies
and infrared imaging (Odyssey Imaging System, LICOR
Bioscience, Bad Homburg, Germany) were used for
detection. Representative blots of at least two independent
experiments are shown.

Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s
t-Test (two-tailed distribution, two-sample, unequal
variance). Drug interaction was analyzed by the CI
method using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge,
UK). CI <0.9 indicates synergism, 0.9-1.1 additivity and
>1.1 antagonism.
