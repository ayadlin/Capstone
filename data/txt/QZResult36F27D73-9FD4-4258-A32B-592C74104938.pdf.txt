Induction Therapy and Outcome
in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
It is generally believed that failure to achieve complete
remission (CR) with the first cycle of induction chemotherapy is associated with poorer outcome in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). A retrospective analysis from
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group1 concludes that
‘‘residual leukemia in a day 10-14 bone marrow does not
predict for a worse prognosis if a second similar cycle of
induction therapy is administered and CR is achieved’’.
An important reason to question this conclusion is
the data: Although there is no significant difference in
outcome amongst patients having required 1 or 2 cycles of
induction therapy to attain CR in the 6 modest-sized (and
thus underpowered) studies individually, the overall
survival (OS) of patients who needed 2 cycles is inferior in
each (Table 4). A pooled analysis, based upon the limited
data provided in the article, suggests that the OS of
patients attaining CR after a single cycle is better.
It is important to distinguish between the detection
of residual leukemia in the day 10-14 bone marrow and
achievement of CR after a second cycle of chemotherapy.
No data are presented on the outcome of patients with
residual leukemia on day 10-14 compared with those
without.
Patients attaining CR after a second cycle constitute
a selected subset of those not attaining CR with the first.
Of the 1035 patients (52%) who did not attain CR with
initial chemotherapy, only 557 (54%) received a second
cycle around day 10-14. It is likely that the remaining
46% contained substantial numbers of patients who had
residual leukemia but did not receive a second cycle of
chemotherapy for various reasons (most likely toxicity
including infections). It is possible that there was selection
of patients who were ‘‘better’’ for a second induction cycle.
The studies that this analysis has relied upon date back to
an era of limited supportive therapy. Today, the availability of better supportive care is likely to make a greater
proportion of patients with residual leukemia eligible for
a second cycle of therapy as well as help them survive it.
With the resultant decrease in selection bias, the underlying nature of the disease may make its prognostic impact
obvious more readily today—even if CR is achieved with
the second cycle.
Most of the postremission therapy administered in
these studies differs from what would be considered standard of care today. It is also possible that inadequate postre-

2236

mission therapy masked outcome differences between
groups because of relatively poor results overall, differences that may become more obvious today with intensive
postremission therapy resulting in better-risk patients
experiencing higher OS.
The paper states that 1272 of 1980 patients enrolled
in the 6 studies attained CR. Tables 2 and 3 imply that all
patients who attained CR did so either with 1 or 2 cycles
of therapy. Does this imply none of the 230 patients who
did not attain CR after the second cycle of chemotherapy
responded to any subsequent salvage therapy?
There are also inconsistencies between some of the
published articles and the current manuscript, which are
not material to the analysis but ought to be explained.
The original E3483 report2 stated that 305 of 449
patients attained CR but 317 of 485 according to this
article. The original PC486 report3 stated that 83 of 111
patients attained CR but 84 of 113 according to this
article. The original E3489 report4 stated that 518 of
740 patients attained CR but 528 of 748 according to this
article. The original E1490 report5 stated that 61 of 117
patients attained CR but 67 of 111 according to this
article.
The question of selection bias has been raised in
the accompanying commentary,6 which also discusses the
heterogeneity of this patient population. Although the
commentary mentions that a significant proportion of such
patients do attain CR without any additional therapy, it
does not discuss what the prognosis of such patients is.
Clearly, much more work is needed to clarify this. For the
moment though, I believe detection of residual leukemia
2 weeks after induction therapy in patients with AML—at
a time when the marrow should be aplastic—must be
regarded as an adverse risk factor until there are better data
to suggest otherwise, even if CR is attained with a second
cycle of chemotherapy administered immediately.

prognosis if a second cycle of induction therapy is administered and CR is achieved.
Finally, we would like to respond to the claim that
the studies on which our report was based were conducted
in ‘‘an era of limited supportive care’’ and, more important, the suggestion that the ‘‘postremission therapy
administered in these studies differs from what would be
considered standard of care today.’’ This is not correct.
E3483 assigned patients to a matched sibling donor transplant; PC486 was a study of autologous transplant;
E3489 was a major intergroup study comparing allogeneic transplant, autologous transplant, and intensive
chemotherapy; E1490 and E3993 were studies for older
patients who received standard induction and consolidation with high-dose cytarabine. Only in E2491 were
patients who received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
excluded. Finally, there are no data to suggest that the supportive care of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the
past 20 years has fundamentally changed. Therefore, there
is every reason to extrapolate the findings reported here to
current postremission therapy of AML.

wish to clarify and respond to major points made in
the letter.
Regarding the statement that ‘‘the overall survival (OS)
of patients who needed 2 cycles is inferior in each study (Table 4),’’ this is clearly incorrect. As shown in Table 4, none of
the comparisons in OS and disease-free survival (DFS) are
statistically significant (even if some studies show a superior
DFS for those receiving 2 cycles) and thus such a claim is surprising. Furthermore, a pooled analysis is inappropriate
because the studies are heterogeneous, as Dr. Mehta mentioned in the last paragraph, in terms of entry criteria, age,
treatment, and outcome with complete remission (CR) rates;
thus each study was examined individually with the aggregate data described in the article.
As mentioned in the accompanying editorial,2 there
is no suggestion in our study that, in general, patients who
have residual leukemia on day 10-14 do not have a worse
prognosis. Indeed, this was not the focus of our report.
For this reason, no data are presented on the outcome of
such patients. It is well recognized that residual leukemia,
in general, on a day 10-14 bone marrow is associated with
a poor prognosis. However, our study of almost 2000
patients demonstrates that the presence of residual disease
on a day 10-14 bone marrow does not predict for a worse
