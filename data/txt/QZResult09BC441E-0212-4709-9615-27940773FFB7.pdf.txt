Mice and Protects against the Production of
Reactive Oxygen Species

Abstract
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (Hnf4α) is a transcription factor that controls epithelial cell polarity and morphogenesis. Hnf4α conditional deletion during postnatal development has minor effects on intestinal epithelium integrity but promotes activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway without causing tumorigenesis. Here, we
show that Hnf4α does not act as a tumor-suppressor gene but is crucial in promoting gut tumorigenesis in
mice. Polyp multiplicity in ApcMin mice lacking Hnf4α is suppressed compared with littermate ApcMin controls.
Analysis of microarray gene expression profiles from mice lacking Hnf4α in the intestinal epithelium identifies
novel functions of this transcription factor in targeting oxidoreductase-related genes involved in the regulation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This role is supported with the demonstration that HNF4α is functionally involved in the protection against spontaneous and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy-induced production
of ROS in colorectal cancer cell lines. Analysis of a colorectal cancer patient cohort establishes that HNF4α is
significantly upregulated compared with adjacent normal epithelial resections. Several genes involved in ROS
neutralization are also induced in correlation with HNF4A expression. Altogether, the findings point to the
nuclear receptor HNF4α as a potential therapeutic target to eradicate aberrant epithelial cell resistance to
ROS production during intestinal tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9423–33. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4α) is an orphan nuclear
receptor expressed in the liver, kidney, pancreas, stomach,
small intestine, and colon (1). Recent experimental evidence has led to the identification of linoleic acid as an
endogenous and reversible HNF4α ligand, reinforcing the
concept that this nuclear receptor could be considered
as a nutritional and pharmaceutical target (2). The strategy
of targeting HNF4α has gained interest because many links
have been established between HNF4A integrity and human
diseases. Indeed, a number of mutations identified within
the HNF4A gene are considered to represent the causes of
several forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (3).

Polymorphisms within the HNF4A promoter region are
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
(3, 4). Moreover, genome-wide association studies have
identified the HNF4A region as a novel ulcerative colitis
susceptibility locus (5).
One powerful way of defining the functional relevance of a
specific transcriptional regulator in a given tissue is through
the use of conditional gene deletion. This was particularly
important for Hnf4α for which classic gene deletion in the
mouse resulted in severe gastrulation defects with early
embryonic lethality (6). Conditional deletion of Hnf4α in β
cells of the mouse pancreas resulted in hyperinsulinemia
with impaired glucose tolerance (7). Expansion of adult pancreatic β-cell mass in response to metabolic demand is
dependent on a specific Hnf4α-dependent transcription network (8). Conditional genetic removal of Hnf4α in the mouse
liver confirmed its crucial role in hepatic functions and epithelium integrity (9, 10). The specific role of Hnf4α in controlling intestinal epithelial functions has emerged recently.
Hnf4α can polarize intestinal epithelial cells in culture (11)
and is potent for the epithelialization of different cell types
(10, 12, 13). Maturation of colonic epithelial cells was shown
to be dependent on Hnf4α when conditionally removed
during early embryonic colonic development (14). This effect
is dependent on the early phases of embryonic development because colonic epithelial deletion at later stages
did not severely impair epithelial functions but led to
long-term chronic inflammatory defects resembling human

inflammatory bowel diseases (15). Hnf4α conditional
deletion in the small intestine led to minor consequences
on the overall integrity of the epithelium structure (13, 16).
The use of an inducible tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombination system led to similar conclusions with the additional observation that loss of Hnf4α was contributing
to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin without causing
polyposis (17).
Intestinal cancer is initiated from mutations that activate
the Wnt pathway (18). This pathway is responsible in maintaining the nuclear-activated status of the transcriptional
regulatory β-catenin/Tcf-4 complex and contributes to the
maintenance of the crypt stem cell/progenitor phenotype
(19). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations
lead to the upregulation of the Wnt signaling that results
in the stabilization of the β-catenin/Tcf-4 complex and
activation of gene targets important in the control of cell
proliferation and the initiation of intestinal tumorigenesis
(20). Recent evidence has described intestinal cancer as a
stem cell disease, with the demonstration that the stem
cell–specific loss of Apc was the major source of intestinal
neoplasia growth (21).
With the use of the ApcMin mouse model, we tested the
hypothesis that Hnf4α could act as an intestinal suppressor
of tumors. Surprisingly, we found that loss of Hnf4α suppressed polyposis in this specific genetic context. We identified HNF4α as a positive regulator of oxidoreductase-related
genes and established a functional link between HNF4α
expression and restriction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in human colon cancer cells. These observations
support a novel and unsuspected role for HNF4α in facilitating intestinal cancer initiation as well as intracellular protection against cancer-related ROS production.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
HT-29 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] cells
were grown in McCoy's growth medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent), 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 2 mmol/L
L -alanyl- L -glutamine (GlutaMAX, Life Technologies),
25 mmol/L HEPES, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells were infected at 80% confluence, as described
before (22), with the pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vector (Sigma)
containing a shRNA against all HNF4α isoforms (5′-CCACATGTACTCCTGCAGATT-3′) and a nontarget shRNA
control vector used as control (5′-CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA-3′). Five days postinfection, cells were used for
protein and RNA extracts, or the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CMDCF-DA) ROS probe (Molecular Probes) was added at
2.5 μmol/L for 30 minutes at 37°C and visualized on a Zeiss
Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss
AxioCam HR camera. HCT116 (ATCC) cells were grown in
the same growing medium as HT-29 cells. Stable populations
of HCT116 cells expressing pBabe Hnf4α1 or empty vector
were generated as described elsewhere (13). Cells were seeded

9424

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

at 16,000 cells/cm2 and cultured for 2 days before treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; Sigma) at a concentration
of 12.5 μmol/L. ROS generation was measured 18 hours later
by using a CM-DCF-DA probe. Positive cells per field were
counted using ImageJ 1.41 software (NIH).
Mice and adenoma counts
ApcMin mice on a C57BL/6J background were used to collect RNA and tissue samples as described elsewhere (13).
12.4KbVilCre transgenic mice (23) and Hnf4αtm1Gonz (The
Jackson Laboratory; ref. 9) were used to produce ApcMin;
Hnf4α+/+(control), ApcMin; 12.4KbVilCre/Hnfαfx/+ (heterozygotes), and ApcMin;12.4KbVilCre/Hnf4αfx/fx (Hnf4αΔIEC) mice
on a pure C57BL/6J background. Polyp counts were determined as described previously (22).
Immunodetections
Immunoblotting, immufluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were conducted as described elsewhere (13, 15).
Anti–β-actin and anti-HNF4α that recognizes both P1 and
P2 from Santa Cruz were used for immublotting. Anti-Ki67
(Neomarkers), anti-HNF4α (R&D), and anti–active-caspase-3
(Cell Signalling) were used in immunofluorescence.
RNA extraction, microarray, and quantitative PCR
RNA was extracted and quantitative reverse transcriptasePCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted as previously described (13).
Primer sequences are available in Supplementary Materials.
For microarray analysis, Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome
430 2.0 arrays were used to compare three Hnf4αΔIEC mice
and three appropriate controls. FlexArray 1.3 was used for
data analysis (http://qc.gqinnovationcenter.com/services/
bioinformatics/flexarray/index.aspx?l=e). Data are available
at Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE20968).
Epithelial cell isolation and
malondialdehyde measurement
Hnf4α mutant and control mice were fasted overnight and
sacrificed. Epithelial cells from the jejunum were then isolated
by the MatriSperse (Collaborative Biomedical, Becton
Dickinson) technique as described previously (24). Free
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined as reported
previously (25). Briefly, proteins were first precipitated with
a 10% NaWO4 as described elsewhere (26). Protein-free
supernatant was then reacted with an isovolume of 0.5%
thiobarbituric acid solution at 95°C for 30 minutes. After
cooling to room temperature, the pink chromogene was
extracted with n-butanol and dried over a stream of nitrogen
at 37°C. The dry extract was then resuspended in the KH2PO4/
methanol (70:30) mobile phase before MDA detection by highperformance liquid chromatography.
Tumor collection
Samples of colon cancer and paired normal colon tissues
have been obtained from 41 patients undergoing surgical
resection. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant therapy.
Tissues were obtained after patient's written informed consent, according to the protocol approved by the Institutional

Universitaire de Sherbrooke. All tissues were frozen in liquid
nitrogen within 15 minutes from resection as recommended
by the Canadian Tumor Repository Network. Tissues were
paraffin embedded and immunostained as described before
(13). Paired tissues were used for total RNA isolation (13) or
protein isolation (27).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and
quantitative PCR
T84 and cells obtained by jejunal mucosa scrapings of
C57BL/6J mice were used at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells
per assay. Cells were sonicated and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed with EZ-Chip as described by the
manufacturer (Millipore). HNF4α was immunoprecipitated
with 4 μg of anti-HNF4α from Santa Cruz, and background

was evaluated with 4 μg of normal goat IgG from Santa Cruz.
Final DNA was purified with High Pure PCR Cleanup (Roche)
and eluted in 150 μL of elution buffer. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
was done with a LightCycler apparatus V2.0 (Roche Diagnostics) on 2 μL of precipitated DNA in each reaction. Primer
sequences are available in Supplementary Materials.
Statistical analysis
Groups were compared with unpaired Student's t test except for tumor collection for which paired Student's t test
was used for comparisons. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used in ChIP experiments to accommodate the non-Gaussian
distribution within all replicates. Correlation tests were conducted with Spearman test. P < 0.05 was considered significant (GraphPad Prism 5, GraphPad Software) and data were
expressed as mean ± SEM.

Results
Hnf4α does not act as a tumor-suppressor gene but is a
novel modifier of intestinal adenoma formation
Hnf4α physically interacts with Tcf-4, reduces β-catenin/
T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcriptional activity, and is involved in the control of intestinal epithelial proliferation (13, 17). The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is mostly
active in crypt stem cell/progenitors, and Hnf4α is induced
during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation in culture (11).
To explore the apparent opposite relationship between
Hnf4α expression and sustained β-catenin activity, we monitored the expression level of Hnf4α along the intestinal
crypt-villus axis as well as in intestinal ApcMin polyps well
characterized by harboring sustained activation of the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway (28). Immunofluorescence detection
revealed nuclear expression of Hnf4α in transit amplifying
and differentiated cells as well as in crypt stem/progenitor
cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, proliferative Ki67-labeled cells
were always positive for Hnf4α in both the small intestine
and colon (Fig. 1B, left). On the contrary, immunofluorescence experiments showed that Hnf4α protein was poorly
detected in the majority of the Ki67-positive ApcMin polyp epithelial cells of the jejunum and colon (Fig. 1B, right). Hnf4α
gene transcript expression was confirmed to be significantly
less elevated in ApcMin polyps when compared with adjacent
normal intestinal biopsies (Fig. 2).
Intestinal polyps originate from stem cells (21). This led us
to postulate that low level of Hnf4α expression within ApcMin
polyps could either be functionally related to polyp formation or only be reflective of the nature of the disorganized
founder stem cells that contribute to polyp formation and
growth. To genetically test whether reducing Hnf4α expression could enhance intestinal tumorigenesis, we generated
mice specifically lacking intestinal epithelial Hnf4α P1 and

Hnf4α Promotes Gut Neoplasia

intestinal tumor initiation was observed in ApcMin; Hnf4αΔIEC
mice compared with ApcMin; Hnf4α control mice (Fig. 3A).
The multiplicity of intestinal polyps with Hnf4α epithelial
loss was dramatically reduced in the jejunum (7.8 ± 2.9
polyps versus 26.1 ± 4.7 polyps in controls; P = 0.0084), ileum
(4.2 ± 1.4 versus 14.9 ± 2.4; P = 0.0034), and colon (0.16 ± 0.16
versus 1.6 ± 0.3; P = 0.0024). Overall, the loss of both Hnf4α
alleles in the intestinal epithelium led to a drastic and significant 68.1% reduction of the polyp load under ApcMin background (P = 0.0017), whereas no significant tendency was
noted when one single Hnf4α allele was lost under the same
background (Fig. 3B). The average diameter size of the remaining polyps of ApcMin; Hnf4αΔIEC mice was not significantly different when compared with the polyps of ApcMin;
Hnf4α control mice (Fig. 3C). Overall, these observations
led to the unexpected conclusion that abrogation of intestinal epithelial Hnf4α expression limited the initiation of intestinal neoplasia under the Apc Min background without
affecting polyp growth.
Conditional loss of Hnf4α in the mouse small intestinal
epithelium is associated with an oxidative stress gene
expression signature
The Hnf4α-promoting effect during gut tumorigenesis led
us to explore a novel physiologic role for this transcriptional
regulator in controlling jejunum epithelial functions. To

clarify the nature of overall gene expression changes associated with the loss of Hnf4α gene integrity in intestinal epithelial cells, a gene expression profiling was performed.
A statistical analysis (P ≤ 0.05) predicted 285 unique mouse
transcripts being significantly modulated between the jejunum of control and conditionally deleted Hnf4α adult mice
(Hnf4αΔIEC; differential ratio ≥2.0; Supplementary Table S1).
To gain insight into how these modifications could be
classified as biological meaning, we used the Database for
Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resources tool (29, 30). Specific systems, such as the
oxidoreductase component as well as the immune and cellular lipid metabolic processes, were identified as the most
predicted significant biological pathways to be affected in
the jejunum of Hnf4αΔIEC mice. The proximal promoter of
74 genes from the oxidoreductase system was screened for
potential Hnf4α binding sites (Supplementary Table S3).
Specific gene targets predicted to be modulated by at least
2-fold with at least one putative Hnf4α-binding site were
further selected (Supplementary Table S3). A qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that these selected 18 individual gene transcripts were significantly reduced in the small intestine of
adult Hnf4αΔIEC mice when compared with control mice
(Fig. 4A). The promoter region for most of these genes was
confirmed to be occupied by Hnf4α as revealed by ChIPqPCR analysis (Fig. 4B). Consequently, the lipid peroxidation

integration of Hnf4α in the HCT116 cell line (Fig. 6B, left)
led to a significant and spontaneous 51.1% (P < 0.001) reduction of the number of ROS-positive cells compared with empty control HCT116 cells (Fig. 6B, middle and right). Because
HCT116 cells do not harbor mutation within the TP53 gene
and thus retain the capacity to produce a significant amount
of ROS following chemotherapeutic treatments (31), we next
evaluated whether ROS deleterious production in response to
5-FU, an agent used in the clinic as an adjuvant therapy for
CRC, could be altered in the presence of Hnf4α. Although
treatment of control HCT116 cells with 5-FU led to an efficient production of intracellular ROS, HCT116 cell lines that
overexpressed Hnf4α displayed a significant 55.3% (P < 0.001)
reduction in the number of ROS-producing cells following
5-FU treatment (Fig. 6C).

end product MDA, a typical marker for oxidative stress, was
significantly elevated in intestinal epithelial cells harvested
from Hnf4αΔIEC mice compared with control mice (1.50-fold;
P ≤ 0.05, n = 9). This observation coincided with a significant
higher index of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis in the small
intestine of Hnf4αΔIEC mice as monitored by immunofluorescence detection of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5A and B). Thus,
the loss of intestinal epithelial Hnf4α led to a reduction in
the expression of oxidoreduction-related genes, along with
a modest but significant increase of intestinal epithelial
oxidative stress and apoptosis.
HNF4α protects against the accumulation of ROS in
colorectal cancer cells
To further establish whether HNF4α could have a direct
role in protecting against intracellular accumulation of
ROS, its expression was modulated within two independent
colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. HNF4α expression was
efficiently neutralized in HT-29 cells with the stable integration of a specific HNF4α-targeted shRNA lentivirus (Fig. 6A,
left). ROS-positive cells were visualized with the use of a CMDCF-DA fluorescent labeling probe (Fig. 6A, middle) and the
total number of ROS-labeled cells was increased by 2.37-fold
(P < 0.001) in HT-29 cells made deficient for HNF4α expression compared with genome-integrated control nontarget
shRNA lentivirus (Fig. 6A, right). A qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the reduction of oxidoreductase-related gene transcripts in HT-29 cells harboring reduced HNF4α expression
(Supplementary Fig. S2). On the contrary, stable retroviral

HNF4α and oxidoreductase-related genes are overly
expressed in CRC
The expression of HNF4α was next assessed in human
CRC samples. HNF4A was increased by 2.19-fold (P = 0.002)
at the gene transcript levels in tumor samples when compared with paired margin resections in 31 patients of 40
(Fig. 7A). A similar analysis at the protein level indicated a
significant 2.81-fold induction (P < 0.0001) of HNF4α protein
in a subset of human cancer samples when individually compared with their paired margin resection (Fig. 7B–D).
To further validate the relationship between HNF4A expression and oxidoreductase-related gene expression status
in CRC, we next monitored expression of specific gene targets that were validated to be decreased in the intestine of
Hnf4αΔIEC mice. This analysis revealed significant increases
in the expression of CYP2B6 (4.38-fold; P = 0.048), CYP2D6
(2.60-fold; P = 0.0182), GSTA4 (1.66-fold; P = 0.024), GSTK1
(1.54-fold; P = 0.002), and NQO1 (3.80-fold; P = 0.0003) gene
transcripts when comparing the ratio of tumor/margin from
CRC patient samples (Fig. 8A). These modulations were significantly correlated with the induced level of HNF4A for
CYP2B6 and GSTK1 (Fig. 8A). Specific primer sets spanning
in average 300 bp within the proximal promoter of oxidoreductase-related genes were used to test for HNF4α occupancy by ChIP-qPCR on cultured CRC cells. This analysis
identified the CYP2B6 and GSTK1 gene promoters to be significantly targeted by HNF4α in the proximal region of the
promoter transcriptional start site (Fig. 8B). However,
HNF4α could be interacting outside of the proximal promoter region for each human oxidoreductase-related genes that
remained negative by this assay. Taken together, these observations support a strong relationship between increased
levels of HNF4α, high expression of HNF4α-targeted
ROS-neutralizing genes, and increased protection against
ROS production in CRC.

Discussion
Hnf4α plays major roles in epithelial cell polarization by
targeting specific genes encoding cell junction molecules in
various tissues, including the intestine (10, 11, 15, 17, 32). Moreover, Hnf4α acts as a morphogen with its capacity to trigger

microvillus formation in nonepithelial cell lines (12, 13). Evidence for a role of Hnf4α in governing the pattern of tissue development came from early conditional deletion of this
transcriptional regulator during mouse liver (10) and colon embryonic development (14). Hnf4α gene deletion approaches
that aimed to investigate the specific role of this regulator on
adult tissue maintenance have revealed lesser consequences on
the liver maintenance (9) and intestinal tissue integrity (13, 15),
supporting the nature of Hnf4α as an embryonic morphogen.
The recent findings that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can interact with Hnf4α in intestinal epithelial cells (17) and hepatocytes
(33) suggested that Hnf4α could act as a tumor-suppressor
gene. Our findings suggest that neutralizing HNF4α transcriptional activity during intestinal cancer is beneficial.

ROS are chemically reactive molecules that display essential roles in biological functions such as cell growth, differentiation, and inflammation (34). Excessive production
of ROS can lead to oxidative damage to intracellular constituents, including lipids, protein, and DNA (35). ROS intracellular levels are controlled with their balanced elimination
from ROS-scavenging systems such as the superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase (34). Although
chronic increases in ROS may contribute to cancer by amplifying genomic instability, it is well described that many
cancer cells develop paradoxical enhancement of their
ROS-detoxifying capacities to become adapted to exogenous
pressure and oxidative stress and then more resistant to
chemotherapy-induced cell death (36). On the other hand,

profound suppression of ROS can be deleterious for normal
stem cell maintenance, resulting in the paradoxical enhancement of genomic alterations (37). Strategies designed to
further induce oxidative stress by decreasing but not eliminating oxidant-detoxifying activities present conceptual
advantages in targeting specific malignant cells with a significant misbalance of their antioxidant system as opposed
to normal cells.
The finding that HNF4α expression can be positively correlated with cancer is not unique. HNFα was reported to be
upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (38), human
gastric intestinal metaplasia (39), and ovarian mucinus
tumors (40). Recent observations implied that a reduction
of HNF4α activity by ligand antagonists could attenuate
cell proliferation and promote apoptotic cell death in two independent CRC cell lines (41). Given the functional role of
this regulator in cellular polarization and differentiation,
these results were unexpected but are in agreement with
our findings.
How does Hnf4α contribute to the tumor multiplicity
in the ApcMin context? Our observations have supported a
relationship between increased levels of Wnt/β-catenin
activity and reduced levels of Hnf4α in pathologic crypt cells
in the mouse intestine. Proliferating progenitor/stem cells
are the origin entities required for polyp initiation and
growth (21) and display a detectable level of Hnf4α expression. Thus, it remains plausible that further reduction of
Hnf4α in epithelial progenitor cells could not influence the
proliferative events that lead to polyp growth. The observation that polyp size was not influenced by the loss of

Hnf4α in ApcMin mice supports this idea. Loss of Hnf4α
transcriptional activity resulted in spontaneous intestinal
epithelial apoptosis in the small intestine, a feature that
was also recently observed in the mouse colonic epithelium
(15) and cultured CRC cell lines (41). A decrease in epithelial
crypt cell survival following loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
manifestation could represent an early cell autonomous
mechanism leading to premature clearance of nascent polyp
initiation in absence of Hnf4α. This possibility remains difficult to show in vivo given the unpredictable occurrence
of LOH in a given pool of ApcMin intestinal epithelial cells.
Gene clustering analysis identified oxidoreductase activities
as the most significant biological functions predicted to
be challenged within Hnf4αΔIEC mice. We found that ROS
production in CRC cell lines was dependent on HNF4α
expression. ApcMin polyp formation is associated with higher
production of oxidative stress (42) as well as changes in
the expression of genes involved in ROS (43) correlating
with the observation that polyp epithelial cells are expressing
lower Hnf4α levels. However, we rationalize that a complete loss of Hnf4α in a biological situation that constantly
exerts oxidative stress pressure would promote the reach of a
ROS threshold that could become deleterious for epithelial
cell survival. The recent identification of a candidate gene
for the modifier of Min 2 locus supports this rationale
(44). Atp5a1, a gene required for oxidative metabolism, was
found to be mutated in this locus, providing a novel link
between dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain,
lethal overproduction of intracellular ROS, and polyp suppression in ApcMin mice (44). On the other hand, increased

level of HNFα expression in human CRC would represent a
subsequent step for tumor epithelial cells to become resistant against sustained ROS intracellular production and
overcome cell death.
In conclusion, our results indicate that Hnf4α is crucial to
facilitate tumorigenesis in ApcMin mice. Hnf4α was found to
be a transcriptional regulator of oxidoreductase gene expression. The modulation of HNF4α expression in CRC cell lines
also confirmed its crucial role in regulating ROS production.
Finally, a significant parallel was found between elevated
expression of HNF4α and high expression of some oxidoreductase genes in CRC biopsies. With the growing interest in
the development of antagonists for blocking HNF4α functions as a therapeutic approach, our observations highlight

the promising exploration of such strategies in a program
designed to reduce antioxidant activities and promote the
efficiency of CRC chemotherapies.
