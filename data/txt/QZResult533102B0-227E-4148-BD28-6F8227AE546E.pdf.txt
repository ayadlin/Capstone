Abstract
The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1a and IL-1b promote tumor angiogenesis that might be counteracted by
the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), anakinra, a clinically approved agent. A diet with high amounts of
phytoestrogens, such as flaxseed (Flax), genistein (GEN), and the mammalian lignan enterolactone (ENL), may
affect breast cancer progression in a similar fashion as the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Both cancer cells and tumor
stroma may be targets for cancer therapy. By using microdialysis in a model of human breast cancers in nude
mice, we could perform species-specific analyses of released proteins in the microenvironment. We show that
tumors treated with tamoxifen and fed Flax or ENL exhibited decreased in vivo release of IL-1b derived from the
murine stroma and decreased microvessel density whereas dietary GEN had no effects. Cancer cell–released IL1Ra were approximately 5 times higher than stroma-derived IL-1Ra. Tamoxifen, Flax, and ENL increased IL-1Ra
levels significantly whereas GEN did not. The tumor stroma contained macrophages, which expressed the
estrogen receptor. In vitro, estradiol decreased IL-1Ra released from breast cancer cells and from cultured
macrophages. IL-1Ra decreased endothelial cell proliferation significantly in vitro whereas breast cancer cell
proliferation was unaffected in presence of estradiol. Finally, IL-1Ra therapy of tumor-bearing mice opposed
estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth and decreased angiogenesis. We conclude that the release of IL-1s
both by cancer cells and the stroma, where macrophages are a key component, may offer feasible targets for
antiestrogen therapy and dietary interventions against breast cancer. Cancer Res; 71(1); 51–60. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) a and IL1b may contribute to angiogenesis, tumor proliferation, and
local invasion of breast cancer (1, 2). It has been suggested that
IL-1b is important for the initiation and completion of angiogenesis and IL-1 a or IL-1 b knockout mice have been shown
to exhibit dramatically impaired ability of tumor development
and angiogenesis (3). Treatment with the naturally occurring
IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which antagonizes the
activities of IL-1s without any agonist effect, may lead to
decreased inflammatory response and inhibited tumor development in mice (4, 5).
Estrogens play an important role in the development and
progression of breast cancer and approximately two thirds of
all breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive. Blocking

the action of estrogens is a corner stone in the medical
treatment of breast cancer today (6, 7).
Phytoestrogens, plant compounds structurally similar to
estrogen, may have both agonistic and antagonistic actions in
breast cancer dependent on the type and dose (8, 9). In Eastern
societies, with a diet containing large amounts of phytoestrogens, the incidence of breast cancer is low and migrant studies
support that lifestyle factors rather than genetics affect breast
cancer risk (10, 11). There are 2 major classes of phytoestrogens: isoflavones, found in high concentrations in soy with
genistein (GEN) being the main compound, and lignans, found
in high amounts in flaxseed (Flax), with enterolactone (ENL)
as a main potent active metabolite (12, 13).
Recent data suggest that the effects of Tamoxifen (Tam), the
most widely used drug against ERþ breast cancer, are potentiated if both the stroma and cancer cells are affected (14). We
have previously found inhibition of angiogenesis of ENL by a
reduction of VEGF secretion both by breast cancer cells and
the tumor stroma (15). Whether tamoxifen and/or various
phytoestrogens affect IL-1s released by tumor cells and/or
stroma is unknown.
In this study, human breast cancer tumors were established
in nude mice creating a model with species-specific components in the tumor microenvironment. By using microdialysis,
which we previously have validated for use in tumor tissue (16–
23), proteins in the tumor microenvironment were sampled.

We show for the first time that Flax, ENL, and Tam decreased
IL-1b released by stroma and increased the levels of both cancer
cell- and stroma-derived IL-1Ra. A diet of GEN did not affect the
release of the IL-1s. In vitro, IL-1Ra decreased cell proliferation
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) whereas the
proliferation of cancer cells was unaffected. Moreover, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with recombinant IL-1Ra
decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Cells culture
Reagents were obtained from Gibco BRL unless otherwise
stated. MCF-7 (HTB-22) human breast cancer cells, characterized by The American Type Culture Collection, by receptor
analysis, growth pattern, and morphology, were maintained in
phenol red–free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 IU/mL penicillin,
50 mg/mL of streptomycin, and 2103 mol/L of L-glutamine at
37 C and 5% CO2. Trypsinized (0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA)
cells were seeded, 20,000 cells/cm2, into petri dishes (CoStar),
and exposed to 109 mol/L of E2 (17b-E2; Apoteket), 106 mol/L
of Tam (Sigma), 106 mol/L of ENL, 106 mol/L of GEN, or their
combinations. ENL (purity > 98%) was obtained from VTT. GEN
(purity ¼ 98%) was a generous gift from Professor William
Helferich (University of Illinois). Hormones were added in
serum-free DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium without phenol red supplemented with 10 mg/mL of transferrin (Sigma Chemicals),
1mg/mL of insulin (Sigma), and 0.2 mg/mL of BSA (bovine
serum albumin; Merck). The medium was changed everyday.
HUVEC were prepared from umbilical cords donated anonymously according to national ethical legislation. Cells were
isolated by digestion at 37 C using M199 medium with 0.1%
collagenase (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and 2% FBS for 20
minutes. Cells were cultured in M199 culture medium containing 20% FBS, 20 mmol/L of HEPES, 1% nonessential amino
acids, 50 IU/mL penicillin, 50 mg/mL of streptomycin, 20 mg/
mL of endothelial cell growth factor (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH), and 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate in 1% gelatincoated bottles at 37 C with 5% CO2 until 70% to 90% confluent.
Cell passages 3 to 5 were used.

dient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were washed twice,
stained with Turk's solution (Merck), and counted. Monocytes, 0.5  106 per well, were seeded in 24-well plates and
incubated for 2 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 to allow macrophage
adhesion. Nonattached cells were removed by washing. The
cells were exposed to 109 mol/L of E2, plus 106 mol/L of
Tam, 106 mol/L of ENL, or 106 mol/L of GEN. After 24 hours,
medium was collected, centrifuged, and stored at 20 C.
For ERa analysis, 5  104 mononuclear cells were cytocentrifuged onto glass slides, air dried, and stored at 20 C. For
staining, mouse anti-human ERa (Dako) and MACH4 (Histolab) was used.
IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-1Ra analyses
Cell culture media and microdialysis samples were analyzed
for Il-1a, Il-1b, and IL-1Ra using human and murine immunoassay kits (R&D Systems). Total protein content of cell lysates
was determined using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).

Proliferation of MCF-7 cells and HUVEC
MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3,000 cells per
well). After 24 hours, E2 and/or recombinant IL-1Ra (Kineret,
Biovitrum) were added in serum-free D-MEM/F12. HUVEC
were seeded (5,000 cells per well) in 1% gelatin-coated, 96-well
plates. After 24 hours, E2 and/or recombinant human IL-1Ra
were added in M199 medium with 1% FBS and 0.1% BSA. After
3 days, the proliferation was analyzed with MTS kit (Promega
Biotech AB) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Animals housing conditions and study protocol
Linkoping University animal ethics research board approved
the study. Athymic female mice (Balb/cA nu/nu, 6–7 weeks old,
Taconic) were housed in pathogen-free isolation facility with a
12-hour light/dark cycle, administered sterilized diet (Special
Diet Services) and water ad libitum. The animals were oophorectomized under intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and implanted with E2 pellets, 0.18 mg/90-day release
providing physiologic E2 concentrations (Innovative Research
of America). Four days after surgery, MCF-7 cells (5  106cells)
were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) on the flanks. Tumor area
was calculated using [(length  width)/2]  p.
In a first experiment, at the time of cancer cell injection,
mice were fed phytoestrogen-free AIN-93G basal diet (BD),
where soy oil was replaced with corn oil and sterilized by
irradiation. At similar tumor sizes, mice were divided into 4
dietary treatment groups: BD (E2 þ BD), BD þ 100 mg/kg of
GEN (E2 þ GEN), BD þ 100 mg/kg of ENL (E2 þ ENL), and BD
þ 10% ground Flax (BD þ Flax). Body weights were similar in
all groups and food intake and body weights were monitored
weekly. Administration of diets resulted in exposure of 10.0 to
16.8 mg/kg of body weight per day of GEN and ENL resulting in
serum concentrations of approximately 0.5 mmol/L (Warri
et al., 2009, unpublished results), which is in the range seen in
women consuming soy products (24, 25) or Flax (26).
In the second experiment, mice with similar tumor sizes were
divided; 1 group continued with the E2 treatment only, whereas
in the other group Tam (1 mg for every 2 days s.c.) was added.
In the third experiment, mice with similar tumor sizes were
divided and 1 group received daily s.c. injections (5 mg per
mouse) of IL-Ra (Kineret, Biovitrum) whereas the control
group was treated with daily injections of the solvent (PBS).

Macrophages preparation for cell culture and ERa
staining
According to the Swedish ethical legislation and after
informed consent, human venous blood was collected in
heparin tubes, diluted with RPMI medium (Invitrogen), and
separated by Ficoll-paque Plus (GE Healthcare) density gra-

Microdialysis of tumor tissue
Microdialysis probes (CMA/20: diameter ¼ 0.5 mm, length
¼ 10 mm, 100 kDa cutoff PES membrane; CMA Microdialysis
AB) were inserted into tumor tissue and perfused at 0.6 mL/
min with 0.9% saline containing 40 mg/mL of dextran (Meda)
as previously described (21). After a 30-minute equilibration

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were cut in 3-mm
sections, deparaffinized, and subjected to immunohistochemistry, IL-1a and IL-1b (mouse anti-human, 5 mg/mL; R&D
Systems), stroma ERa (rabbit anti-mouse ERa; dilution
1:2,000; Lifespan Bioscience) and the macrophage marker

anti-von Willebrand's factor was used (rabbit anti-human,
which cross-reacts with mouse protein, dilution 1:1,000: Dako
A/S). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.
Negative controls did not show staining. In a blinded manner,
high-power fields (200) were examined from tumors in each
group. The IL-1 staining was scored as weakly or strongly

Statistical analyses
The values represent mean  SE. Statistical analyses were
performed using Student's t test, Fishers's exact test, and
ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test where appropriate (GraphPad Prism 5.0).

Results
ENL and Flax, but not GEN, reduced tumor growth and
tumor angiogenesis in vivo
In this model, E2 is required for tumor take and continued
tumor growth of MCF-7 in nude mice. Therefore, no untreated
control group could be included. Instead, the various diets and
treatments were added with a stable background of estradiol
(E2) at physiologic levels. As previously shown (15), ENL and
Flax decreased tumor growth whereas mice fed with GEN
exhibited similar tumor growth as mice fed BD (Fig. 1A). After
14 days of diet, tumors in the E2 þ ENL group were significantly
smaller compared with the E2 þ BD and E2 þ GEN groups (P <
0.01; Fig. 1A). Tumors of mice in the E2 þ Flax group did also
exhibit significantly smaller tumors compared with E2 þ BD
and E2 þ GEN mice (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). The microvessel areas
from E2 þ ENL-exposed and E2 þ Flax-exposed animals were
decreased compared with E2 þ BD and E2 þ GEN tumors
(Fig. 1B; P < 0.0001). E2 þ GEN did not affect tumor growth or
microvessel area compared with E2 þ BD. In the Tam, ENL, and
Flax group, no mice succumbed heavy tumor burden or other
illnesses before the end of the experiment.
MCF-7 tumors express cellular IL-1a and IL-1b
Immunohistochemical staining confirmed expression of IL1a and IL-1b in MCF-7 cells. In 10 randomly selected areas of 3
different tumors in each treatment group, the intensity of
staining was scored. There were no differences in intensity
of the staining between the treatments, IL-1a stained strongly
positive in 27 of 30, 26 of 30, 26 of 30, 28 of 30, 27 of 30 areas in E2,
E2 þ Tam, E2 þ ENL, E2 þ Flax, and E2 þ GEN, respectively
(Fig. 2A). For IL-1b, 29 of 30, 30 of 30, 28 of 30, 30 of 30, 29 of 30
areas were scored as weakly positive in E2, E2 þ Tam, E2 þ ENL,
E2 þ Flax, and E2 þ GEN tumor sections (Fig. 2B).
ENL and Flax, but not GEN, decreased extracellular
stroma-derived IL-1b and increased extracellular
stroma- and cancer cell–derived IL-1Ra
Microdialysis was performed on size-matched tumors from
the different diet groups. As the tumors consisted of human
cancer cells surrounded by a murine stroma, it was possible to
distinguish from which compartment in the tumor microenvironment, the cytokines were released. As hypoxia may
affect several factors important in angiogenesis regulation, the
tumors were size matched and exhibited no necrotic areas
confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. IL-1a
(human and murine) and human IL-1b were not detectable
in the microdialysates. Stroma-derived murine IL-1b was

in the tumors from E2 þ BD group, 82  5.3 pg/mL of human
IL-1Ra compared with 18  2.5 pg/mL of murine IL-1Ra (P <
0.0001). Both cancer cell- and stroma-derived IL-1Ra were
significantly increased in tumors of E2 þ ENL-exposed and E2
þ Flax-exposed animals compared with E2 þ BD fed mice
(Fig. 3B and C; P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). E2þGEN
did not affect IL-1s compared with E2 þ BD.

Tamoxifen decreased extracellular stroma-derived
IL-1b and increased extracellular stroma- and cancer
cell–derived IL-1Ra
To elucidate if Tam induced similar effects as ENL and Flax
on the secretion of IL-1s, another set of animals were set up. As
expected, Tam significantly reduced tumor growth as shown
in Figure 1C. This was associated with reduced angiogenesis,
confirming our previous data (Fig 1D). As Figure 3D shows,
Tam decreased IL-1b in a similar fashion as ENL and Flax, E2
þ Tam versus E2; P < 0.05. There were also similar effects on
IL-1Ra as with ENL and Flax. There was a pronounced
upregulation of stroma-derived IL-1Ra after Tam exposure
(P < 0.0001; Figs. 3 and 4A and B). Also, the cancer cell–derived
IL-1Ra was increased after Tam treatment (P < 0.01; Fig. 3E).
Macrophages and ERa-expressing cells in the tumor
stroma
By using an antibody raised against murine ERa without
cross-reactivity to the human receptor, we show that some of
the stroma cells expressed ERa (Fig. 4A). Thereafter, we

www.aacrjournals.org

stained the sections for immune cells and found very few/
no NK (natural killer) cells and neutrophils in the tumors (data
not shown). However, the stroma contained large areas of
macrophages (Fig. 4B). In line with previous data (27, 28)
showing that macrophages express ERa we found that the
areas staining for macrophages also were stained for ERa
(Fig. 4A and B). To confirm this, we isolated mononuclear cells
from venous blood and found that macrophages expressed
ERa (Fig. 4D). To further analyze if macrophages responded to
our treatments, we cultured isolated macrophages in vitro and
exposed them to E2, Tam, ENL, and GEN. In line with previous
data (29), E2 decreased the IL-1Ra levels significantly compared with controls (P < 0.01; Fig. 4E). This decrease was
counteracted with all treatments (Fig. 4D). The macrophages
also secreted low levels of IL-1a ; 34  3.4 pg/106 cells to 44 
5.0 pg/106 cells without any differences between the various
treatment groups. The levels of IL-1b were between 522  52
pg/106 cells and 852  81 pg/106 cells in the different treatment groups with a significantly higher level in the E2 þ GEN
group compared with E2 alone; P < 0.05.

Tamoxifen, ENL, and IL-1Ra in Breast Cancer

E2 decreased whereas ENL and Tamoxifen increased
secreted levels of IL-1Ra released by MCF-7 cells in vitro
MCF-7 cells were cultured to explore if the in vivo data on
IL-1Ra could be verified. Secreted IL-1a and IL-1b were
below detection levels of the ELISA. E2 significantly
decreased IL-1Ra compared with controls without hormones
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 5). The addition of GEN did not significantly
affect the IL-1Ra compared with E2 alone. ENL reversed the
E2-induced decreased IL-1Ra levels back to control levels, E2
versus E2 þ ENL; P < 0.0001. The addition of Tam did not only
reverse the decreased levels by E2 but increased the levels
significantly also compared with the control group (P <
0.0001; Fig. 4). When used alone without E2, ENL and GEN
increased the levels of IL-1Ra to some extent compared with
the control cells whereas Tam increased the levels significantly, approximately 3 times above the control levels.
In presence of E2, MCF-7 proliferation was unaffected
by IL-1Ra
At high concentrations of IL-1Ra, a decrease of MCF-7 cell
proliferation was detected (P < 0.01; Fig. 6A). However, in
presence of E2, similar to the in vivo situation IL-1Ra, at any
concentrations, did not affect proliferation compared to E2
alone (Fig. 6B).
IL-1Ra inhibited cell proliferation of HUVEC in vitro
As we detected decreased angiogenesis in the tumor sections, we set up HUVEC cells for the proliferation assay. As
shown in Figure 6C and D, recombinant IL-Ra did significantly
inhibit the proliferation of HUVEC in a dose–response fashion,
both with and without E2; P < 0.0001.
IL-1Ra inhibited E2-induced tumor growth and
angiogenesis in vivo
In a final experiment, we wanted to confirm if IL-1Ra had the
ability to reduce tumor growth and/or angiogenesis in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. At similar tumor sizes, 1 group
of animals was treated with daily injections of IL-1Ra and the
other group received daily injections of the solvent. Tumors of
mice treated with IL-1Ra exhibited tumor stasis/tumor regression whereas the tumors in the control group continued to
grow. After 3 weeks of treatment, there was a significant
difference in tumors sizes between E2 and E2 þ IL-1Ra (P <
0.0001; Fig. 7A). The tumors in the IL-1Ra did also exhibit
decreased microvessel density (P < 0.0001; Fig. 7B and C).

Discussion
Here, we show that effects on IL-1s, released both by cancer
cells and the stroma, are involved in the therapeutic effects of
Tam in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. As previously
shown, GEN did not inhibit or enhance estrogen-stimulated
breast cancer growth whereas both Flax and ENL alone counteracted tumor growth in a similar manner (15, 30). Tumors of
mice treated with Tam, fed Flax or ENL exhibited decreased in
vivo release of IL-1b derived from the murine stroma and these
tumors also demonstrated significantly lower microvessel
density whereas dietary GEN had no effects. IL-1a and IL-1b

derived from the cancer cells were not detectable extracellularly. This is most likely due to IL-1a being an intracellular
protein and very low levels of secretion of human IL-1b by the
cancer cells. However, immunohistochemistry confirmed
expression of these cytokines in our model. IL-1Ra in the tumor
microenvironment was released both by the stroma and the
cancer cells with approximately 5 times higher levels from the
cancer cells than the stroma-derived IL-1Ra. Tam, Flax, and
ENL increased these levels significantly whereas GEN did not.
In vitro, E2 decreased IL-1Ra and this could to some extent be
counteracted by GEN whereas ENL reversed this decrease back
to the control levels. Tam not only counteracted the reduced
IL-1Ra levels but also further increased levels above the control
cells. We detected a slight but significant decrease of the cancer
cell proliferation by adding IL-1Ra to the cells but this was
abolished in presence of E2 in the cell culture. Contrary to
cancer cells, HUVEC proliferation was significantly decreased
by IL-1Ra in a dose-dependent manner both with and without
E2 in the culture. This suggests that the therapeutic effect of IL1Ra mainly depends on decreased angiogenesis without significant effects on cancer cell proliferation. IL-1Ra therapy to
tumor-bearing mice resulted in tumor stasis/regression and
this suggests IL-1Ra to be a key mediator of estrogen-dependent breast cancer progression mainly by effects on the
tumor stroma. These findings are consistent with other studies
showing no effect on cancer cell proliferation in vitro by adding
IL-1Ra but a significant tumor growth inhibition in vivo (31). As
previously shown, macrophages expressed ERa, although not
all ERa stained cells in the tumor stroma were macrophages
and not all tumor macrophages stained for ERa (27, 28). In vitro
culturing of macrophages also showed that our treatments
affected IL-1Ra with a downregulation by E2 and higher levels

in the treatment groups. This suggests that macrophages may
be 1 component involved in stroma-derived release of IL-1 in
tumor tissue and a target for cancer therapies.
Studies have shown that IL-1b is required for tumor angiogenesis and that this effect can be inhibited by IL-1Ra and that
IL-1b knockout mice exhibit impaired angiogenesis (3, 4, 32).
We have previously shown a proangiogenic effect of E2 in
breast cancer with a potent effect on VEGF and IL-8 secretion
(18–20, 33). Here, we demonstrate that altering the levels of IL1s may be another mechanism of the proangiogenic effect of
E2. The tumor stroma is also a target for cancer therapeutics
and it has been shown that a reactive stroma may predict the
response to chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer (34).
Moreover, Tam has been shown to induce a microenvironment, which is suppressive to breast cancer cells (14). In line
with these data, we show in this study that the stroma cells in
the tumors express ERa. Hence, the tumor stroma may be a
target for antiestrogen treatment as we demonstrate that Tam
increased stroma-derived IL-1Ra and decreased stromaderived IL-1b. Several studies have reported that high IL-1b
concentration within the tumor microenvironment is associated with a more virulent tumor phenotype and correlates

58

with a higher rate of recurrence (2, 35). Moreover in breast
cancer patients, it has been shown that high levels of IL-1Ra
and low levels of IL-1 at the tumor site is associated with a
better prognosis (36) emphasizing the clinical relevance of our
results. The cancer cells in our model did produce low levels of
extracellular IL-1b. However, significant amounts of IL-1b
derived from the stroma were present and a target for IL1Ra therapy as we show that daily s.c. injections with IL-1Ra
resulted in decreased tumor growth. This supports the concept of blocking IL-1 as a successful therapy against cancer as
recently reviewed by Dinarello (37).
The majority of breast cancers are ERþ and antiestrogen
therapy is a corner stone in the medical treatment of this
disease (6). Despite antiestrogen therapy, some patients will
develop resistance and eventually die of metastatic disease and
the antiestrogen therapies, such as Tam, and aromatase inhibitors may induce severe side effects. Hence, it is important to
study the mechanisms involved in estrogen and antiestrogens
action in breast cancer to develop novel therapeutic strategies
against this disease. Components in our diet, such as phytoestrogens, may attenuate the incidence of breast cancer and
progression of established disease (8, 9, 38, 39). We have

previously shown that ENL in absence or presence of E2
inhibited breast cancer growth by enhanced apoptosis and
decreased VEGF secretion without any estrogenic effects on
uteri and that GEN similar to E2 increased MCF-7 cell proliferation whereas ENL did not (15, 30, 40, 41). Both GEN and
ENL can interact with ERs with different affinity and with tissue
specificity depending on dose and presence/absence of E2,
suggesting an ER-related mechanism of action by these compounds (42, 43). Our present results demonstrate that phytoestrogens may also affect IL-1s. Ingestion of Flax or ENL
exerted similar effects of those seen in mice treated with Tam
although Tam induced a more potent effect. GEN did not affect
the IL-1s demonstrating that various phytoestrogen may have
very different effects on tumor biology. Our data support
previous studies showing an attenuation of the inflammatory
response by tamoxifen and phytoestrogens (44, 45).
We conclude that IL-1Ra may be involved in estrogendependent breast cancer growth and that treatment with
IL-1Ra to tumor-bearing mice decreased estrogen-dependent
breast cancer growth. Tam, Flax, and ENL affected IL-1s
released by the tumor stroma and we show that, at least in

part, this may be attributable to macrophages, which expressed
the ERa. In vitro, IL-1Ra did not have any direct effect on the
tumor cells but significantly decreased endothelial cell proliferation. This suggests that the antitumor effects of IL-1Ra were
mainly mediated through a tumor–stroma interaction. Our
results demonstrate previously unrecognized mechanisms of
E2, Tam, and dietary factors on breast cancer growth.
