Abstract
The Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in many tumors, including highly proliferative glioblastomas, but how they are wired with the cell cycle remains
imperfectly understood. Inhibitors of MEK/ERK and mTOR
pathways are tested as anticancer agents. They are generally
considered to induce a G1 cell cycle arrest through downregulation of D-type cyclins and up-regulation of p27kip1.
Here, we examined the effect of targeting mTOR by rapamycin
and/or MEK by PD184352 in human glioblastoma cell lines. In
combination, these drugs cooperatively and potently inhibited
the G1-S transition and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. Their cooperation could not be explained by their partial
and differential inhibitory effects on cyclin D1 or D3 but
instead by their synergistic inhibition of the activating T172
phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4. This
appeared independent of p27 and unrelated to weak modulations of the CDK-activating kinase activity. The T172
phosphorylation of CDK4 thus appears as a crucial node
integrating the activity of both MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways. Combined inhibition of both pathways should be
considered as a promising strategy for treatment of tumors
harboring a deregulated CDK4 activity. [Cancer Res 2009;

Introduction
The Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in many
tumors including glioblastomas, leading to deregulation of various
metabolic processes, including proliferation and cell cycle progression. Inhibitors of these cascades are thus of great interest for
cancer therapy and are, or have been, used in clinical trials (1–5).
Rapamycin very specifically inhibits mTOR-raptor complex
(mTORC1), resulting in dephosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and
4EBP1 and inhibited protein translation (4). Moreover, MEK
inhibitors and rapamycin induce G1 cell cycle arrests in various
cell systems, which is associated with inhibition of retinoblastoma
protein (pRb) phosphorylation through inactivation of cyclin-

dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 and 2 (6). This inhibition of CDK4
activity is believed to result from down-regulation of D-type cyclins
(7–10) and/or accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p27kip1 (11).
CDK4 couples mitogenic/oncogenic signaling pathways with the
core cell cycle regulation. Its activation is essential for many
oncogenic processes (9, 12). Critical features of CDK4 activation
remain poorly known or debated, including its regulated association with D-type cyclins, subcellular location, activating T172
phosphorylation, and the roles of Cip/Kip CDK ‘‘inhibitors’’ in these
processes (13). We have recently shown CDK4 T172 phosphorylation as a crucial target for both mitogenic and antimitogenic
signals (14–16). Here, we identify it as the target of strong
inhibitions of S-phase entry in glioblastoma cell lines by a
combined inhibition of mTORC1 and MEK1/2 by rapamycin and
PD184352.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. T98G, U-87 MG, and U-138 MG (American Type Culture
Collection) are tumorigenic human glioblastoma cell lines. T98G cells retain
serum dependence of proliferation but lack both p16 and functional p53,
whereas U-87 MG cells express wild-type p53. They were cultured in DMEM
+ 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After starvation in 0.2% FBS for 3 days, cells
were growth stimulated by 15% FBS and DNA replicating cells were
identified by 30 min incubation with BrdUrd. Rapamycin was from
Calbiochem and PD184352 was kindly provided by Dr. Philip Cohen
(University of Dundee). They were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, which
were thus added in all the treatments at concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%,
respectively.
Immunoblot analyses. Equal amounts of whole-cell extract proteins
were separated according to molecular mass and immunodetected using
the following antibodies: monoclonal antibodies against cyclin D1, cyclin
D3, and p27 (all from Neomarkers); anti-total pRb monoclonal antibody (BD
Pharmingen); polyclonal anti-phospho-pRb (T826) antibody (Biosource/
Invitrogen); polyclonal antibodies against phospho-p70 S6 kinase (T389),
phospho-Akt (T308), and total Akt, rabbit monoclonal antibody against
phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (S235/236), and monoclonal antibody against
phospho-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (T202/Y204; all from
Cell Signaling Technology); and polyclonal antibodies against CDK4, cyclin
H, ERK2, and monoclonal anti-CDK7 antibody (all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The monoclonal antibody from BD Pharmingen was used
for simultaneous detection of both poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and its
cleavage product and the anti-a-tubulin antibody was from Neomarkers.
Secondary antibodies were coupled either to horseradish peroxidase
(Amersham Biosciences) for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Western Lightning; Perkin-Elmer) or to DyLight 680 and 800 (Pierce
Biotechnology) for infrared fluorescence detection using the Odyssey
scanner (LI-COR).
Immunoprecipitation. Coimmunoprecipitations were done as described (14, 15) using monoclonal antibodies against cyclin D1 and D3
(Neomarkers), a mixture of the K25020 anti-p27 monoclonal antibody (BD
Pharmingen) and the C-15 p27 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or polyclonal antibody against cyclin H (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

pRb kinase assay. As described (14, 15), immunoprecipitated protein
complexes were incubated with ATP and a recombinant pRb fragment
(QED) before SDS-PAGE separation of the incubation mixture and Western
blotting detection of the S780 phosphorylation of the pRb fragment, cyclin
D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, and p27.
Separation of phospho-CDK4 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As described (14), immunoprecipitated protein complexes were
denatured in a buffer containing 7 mol/L urea and 2 mol/L thiourea.
Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing on immobilized linear pH
gradient (pH 3-10) strips. After SDS-PAGE separation and blotting, CDK4
was immunodetected and enhanced chemiluminescence detections were
quantified using a GS-800 densitometer and the Quantity One software
(Bio-Rad Laboratories).
CDK-activating kinase activity assay. As described (16), inactive cyclin
D3 complexes containing nonphosphorylated CDK4 or CDK6 were
immunoprecipitated from serum-starved T98G cells (14) and used as a
substrate for activation by recombinant CDK-activating kinase (CAK;
positive control) or CAK complexes immunoprecipitated from the assayed
T98G cells. Their in vitro activation was then shown by their pRb kinase
activity assessed as above.
Transfection. During starvation in 0.2% FBS, T98G cells were transfected
for 12 h using Lipofectamine with 2 Ag/mL pcDNA3 vectors encoding HAtagged wild-type CDK4 or T172ACDK4 (14). Cells were then stimulated by
15% FBS for 16 h with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) during the last 30 min.
For double immunofluorescent detection of incorporated BrdUrd and the
HA epitope of CDK4 using two mouse monoclonal antibodies, cells were
fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 90 s at 4jC and then with methanol for
10 min at -20jC, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.5) at
room temperature, and blocked for 30 min with 5% normal sheep serum.
BrdUrd was unmasked by 30 min incubation with 2 mol/L HCl. After
washings, cells were then incubated overnight at 4jC with anti-HA antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then for 2 h with Cy3-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin (Jackson Immunoresearch). Washed cells were
then successively incubated for 30 min with 1% normal mouse serum for
2 h with unconjugated anti-IgG F(ab) fragment (50 Ag/mL; Jackson
Immunoresearch) and then overnight at 4jC with mouse anti-BrdUrd
monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson) followed by biotinylated
anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham) and fluorescein-conjugated
streptavidin (Amersham).

as detected by immunofluorescent detection of active caspase-3
and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (data not shown) and
Western blotting detection of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and its
cleavage product (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S1B and E).
Rapamycin and PD184352 similarly cooperated to inhibit pRb
phosphorylation, including at T826, which is specifically targeted
by CDK4 (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S1B and E). We thus
analyzed the expression of CDK4 and its regulatory proteins (Fig.
2C; Supplementary Fig. S1B and E). CDK4 levels were not affected.
Serum induction of cyclin D1 in T98G cells was partially inhibited
by PD184352 and slightly more by combined drugs (Fig. 2C). In the
other two cell lines, cyclin D1 accumulation was constitutive and
only slightly reduced by PD184352 in U-87 MG cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B and E). By contrast, in the three cell lines, rapamycin
but not PD184352 reduced cyclin D3 expression, which was
essentially independent of serum (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S1B
and E). In T98G cells, PD184352 and, more weakly, rapamycin
prevented the serum-induced down-regulation of p27 (Fig. 2C).
However, in the other two cell lines, serum and the inhibitors had a
much weaker effect on p27 levels (Supplementary Fig. S1B and E),
which thus unlikely mediated the strong modulations of DNA
synthesis and pRb phosphorylation.
Rapamycin and PD184352 cooperatively inhibit CDK4
activity. We next analyzed the formation and pRb kinase activity
of D-type cyclin-CDK4 complexes in T98G cells. Serum induced the
pRb kinase activity associated with cyclin D1 and D3 (Fig. 2D). In
cyclin D1 complexes, this was in part explained by increased cyclin

Results
Complete inhibition of DNA synthesis and pRb phosphorylation requires the combined inhibition of MEK1/2 and
mTOR-raptor pathways. Rapamycin and PD184352 have been
tested as potential anticancer drugs in various phase I and II
clinical trials (1, 2, 4). In serum-stimulated T98G and other
glioblastoma cell lines, inhibition of MEK1/2 by PD184352 resulted
in a selective dose-dependent decrease of ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
whereas rapamycin completely and selectively inhibited the
phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and S6 protein, reflecting
mTORC1 activity (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). Used alone,
rapamycin and PD184352 at concentrations that completely
blocked ERK phosphorylation only partly inhibited the seruminduced DNA synthesis (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1). Nevertheless, the combination of both drugs cooperatively blocked
serum-stimulated S-phase entry (Fig. 2A) and proliferation (Fig. 2B)
in T98G cells. In U-87 MG and U-138 MG cells that maintained a
somewhat higher rate of DNA synthesis on serum deprivation,
combined rapamycin and PD184352 in the presence of serum
similarly cooperated to inhibit DNA replication, although the
inhibition by PD184352 alone was more pronounced in U-87 MG
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and D). On the other hand,
rapamycin and PD184352, alone or in combination, did not
increase the proportion of apoptotic cells in the three cell lines

MEK and mTOR Pathways Cooperate on CDK4 Phosphorylation

D1 expression, but inactive cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes were
already present in serum-starved cells as described previously
(14). Rapamycin alone reduced both the presence and the activity
of cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes in serum-stimulated cells. However,
the reduced presence of cyclin D3 appeared to reorient CDK4
toward cyclin D1 complexes, which remained active (Fig. 2D).
Conversely, PD184352 weakly decreased the amount of cyclin D1
and cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes, but CDK4 association to cyclin D3
increased, and the pRb kinase activity of both cyclin D1-CDK4 and
cyclin D3-CDK4 was only partially inhibited (Fig. 2D). An almost
complete inhibition of pRb kinase activity was achieved in both
cyclin D1 and D3 complexes only when rapamycin and PD184352
were combined (Fig. 2D).
In both cyclin D1 and D3 immunoprecipitations and all the
different cell treatments, the presence of p27 and CDK4 closely
correlated (Fig. 2D). Even at its reduced levels in serum-stimulated
T98G cells (as seen in Fig. 2C), p27 is not limited for its association
with cyclin D1/3-CDK4 complexes (14). Therefore, the observed
modulations of p27 accumulation in response to rapamycin and/or
PD184352 (Fig. 2C) had no effect on p27 association to CDK4
complexes (Fig. 2D) and thus unlikely explained the inhibition of
the activity of cyclin D1/3-CDK4 complexes by these drugs.
Rapamycin and PD184352 cooperatively inhibit CDK4
activating phosphorylation. In several systems including T98G
cells, we have identified the activating T172 phosphorylation of
CDK4 as a crucial target for regulation of the activity of cyclin D1/
3-CDK4 complexes (13–16). The relative presence of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CDK4 forms in coimmunoprecipitated complexes was assessed as previously (14) using
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3A). We have previously
identified the most negatively charged form as the T172 phosphoCDK4 using [32P]phosphate incorporation, a new phosphospecific
antibody, in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant CAK, and
analysis of T172A-mutated CDK4 (14).
Serum stimulation of T98G cells induced the T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 associated not only with cyclins D1 and D3 but also
with p27 (Fig. 3A). In the other two cell lines, T172 phospho-CDK4
was also abundantly associated with p27 (Supplementary Fig. S1C
and F), as we have observed it in a variety of cell types and
situations (14, 15). At variance with initial claims (17), p27 thus
unlikely prevented the activating phosphorylation of CDK4 (14). In
T98G cells, combined rapamycin and PD184352 totally inhibited
the phosphorylation of CDK4 coimmunoprecipitated with cyclin
D1, cyclin D3, or p27 (Fig. 3A), thus explaining the total inhibition
of pRb kinase activity (Fig. 2D). Both drugs used alone induced
partial inhibition of CDK4 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). In U-87 MG
and U-138 MG cells, the phosphorylation of CDK4 associated to
cyclin D1 or D3 was also strongly inhibited only when rapamycin
and PD184352 were combined (Supplementary Fig. S1C and F).
Nonphosphorylated T172A CDK4 but not wild-type CDK4 prevented serum-induced DNA synthesis in T98G cells (Fig. 3B),
showing that inhibition of CDK4 T172 phosphorylation can suffice
to explain the cell cycle arrest by combined rapamycin and
PD184352.
Combined rapamycin and PD184352 do not block CAK
activity. The activating T172 phosphorylation of CDK4, like the
analogous T-loop phosphorylation of other CDKs, is considered to
be done only by CAK, the cyclin H-CDK7-Mat1 complex (18, 19).
However, the activity of CAK is generally constitutive and
nonregulated (13, 14, 18). We thus assessed the activity of cyclin
H-CDK7 complexes from cells treated or not with rapamycin and/

10 h (C and D ) and treated or not with rapamycin (rapa ; 40 nmol/L) and/or
PD184352 (5 Amol/L). A, DNA synthesis was evaluated from duplicate dishes by
counting the percentage of nuclei having incorporated BrdUrd during the last

In this assay, these cyclin H-CDK7

recombinant cyclin H-CDK7-Mat1 complex
(CAK; lane 7 ) were mixed and incubated
with ATP and inactive cyclin D3-CDK4/6
complexes immunoprecipitated from
quiescent T98G cells (IP cyc D3 ; lane 6),
or a similar mock immunoprecipitation
(IP IgG ; lane 9), used as a substrate. The
resulting activation of the cyclin D3-CDK4/6

pRb kinase activity. The mixtures

very slightly inhibited cyclin H expression and CAK activity, and
PD184352 did not amplify this weak inhibition (lane 5). Overall, the
modulations of CDK4 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) did not correlate
with the presence and activity of CAK (Figs. 2C and 3C). Of note,
the inactive yet activatable cyclin D3-CDK4/6 complexes from
quiescent T98G cells did not autoactivate (and thus did not
autophosphorylate) during incubation with 2 mmol/L ATP (Fig. 3C,
lane 6), consistent with the normal T172 phosphorylation of
inactive K35RCDK4-cyclin D3 in serum-stimulated cells.1

Discussion
In this study, we have observed in several glioblastoma cell lines
that an almost complete inhibition of DNA synthesis, pRb

phosphorylation, and CDK4 activity could not be achieved using
rapamycin or PD184352 alone but with the combination of both
drugs. The synergy of rapamycin and PD184352 on CDK4 activity
could not be explained by their partial and differential inhibitory
effects on cyclin D1 or D3 accumulation but instead by their
cooperative inhibition of CDK4 T172 phosphorylation, which
appears independent of p27 or modulation of CAK activity.
Although it remains possible that combined rapamycin and
PD184352 could also impair cell cycle progression by other
mechanisms unrelated to CDK4, the observed inhibition of CDK4
phosphorylation and activity is fully sufficient to explain the
G1-phase arrest. The present study thus provides first evidence that
MEK and mTOR-dependent cascades might signal cell cycle
progression through T172 phosphorylation of CDK4, which appears
as a crucial node integrating these pathways.
The mechanisms of regulation of CDK4 activating T172
phosphorylation are unknown. Together with other unexpected
observations, such as our findings that the analogous T-loop

phosphorylation of cyclin D3-bound CDK6 is not induced by serum
in T98G cells (14) or that CDK4 phosphorylation is not precluded
by p27 binding in various cells (14), the present results support our
hypothesis that CAK might not be the regulated CDK4-activating
kinase (13). Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways might
cooperate by activating different CDK4 kinases (and/or inactivate
different CDK4 phosphatases), separately concurring to the crucial
activation of D-type cyclin-CDK4 complexes. Alternatively, they
could converge at an upstream step regulating such unknown
CDK4 kinase(s). The major challenge ahead will be to elucidate
such intermediary mechanisms, which may lead to identification of
novel therapeutic targets and suggest novel cell cycle-based
therapies in malignant glioblastomas and other tumors.
Rapamycin and derivatives, as well as MEK inhibitors, have been
tested extensively in patients with highly proliferative tumors such
as recurrent glioblastomas, but only a minority of patients showed
an anticancer activity and the molecular determinants of drug
response are generally unknown (2, 4, 5). On the other hand, a few
in vitro studies recently reported cooperative antiproliferative
effects of combined suppression of MEK and mTOR activities in
tumor cells of various origins (20–22). A recent study by Rich et al.

inhibitor and LBT613, a new Raf inhibitor, in blocking proliferation
and invasion of glioma cell lines (23). Together with this prior
study, our results suggest that the combined inhibition of mTOR
and ERK pathways should be considered, in preclinical animal
models as well as in clinical settings, to treat not only
glioblastomas, which are resistant to most therapies, but also
other tumors harboring a deregulated CDK4 activity.
