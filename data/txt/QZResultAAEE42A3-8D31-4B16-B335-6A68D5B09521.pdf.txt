Abstract

Author Manuscript

Targeting altered cancer cell metabolism with the glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), is a
viable therapeutic strategy, but the effects of 2DG on lymphoma cells and the mechanism of
action are unknown. Five T cell lymphoma lines (TCLs) and two B cell lymphoma lines (BCLs)
were shown to be highly sensitive to 2DG. Examination of the cell death pathway demonstrated
proapoptotic protein Bax “activation” and caspase cleavage in 2DG-treated cells. However, QVD-OPh, a potent inhibitor of caspase activity, provided minimal protection from death. In
contrast, overexpressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 dramatically enhanced survival of 2DGtreated cells that was negated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. BH3-only members, Bim and Bmf, were
upregulated by 2DG, and shRNAs targeting Bim protected from 2DG toxicity demonstrating that
Bim is a critical mediator of 2DG toxicity. 2DG also induced GADD153/CHOP expression, a
marker of ER stress and a known activator of Bim. Mannose, a reagent known to alleviate ER
stress, transiently protected from 2DG-induced cell death. Examination of the effects of 2DG on
energy metabolism showed a drop in ATP levels by 30 min that was not affected by either Bcl-2
or mannose. These results demonstrate that ER stress appears to be rate limiting in 2DG-induced
cell death in lymphoma cells and this cell killing is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
Bcl-2 inhibition combined with 2DG may be an effective therapeutic strategy for lymphoma.

Introduction
Cancer cells do not regulate glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the same fashion as
non-transformed cells and this phenomenon has been termed the Warburg effect. In an
attempt to exploit metabolic differences between cancer and normal cells, drugs like the
glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), have been used to inhibit hexokinase, the rate
limiting enzyme in glycolysis (Crane and Sols, 1954; Tower, 1958). The inhibition of the
hexokinase and glycolysis eventually leads to metabolic stress and cell death that occurs
more rapidly in cancer vs. normal cells (Aykin-Burns et al., 2009). Since tumor cells have a
greater tendency to depend on glycolysis than normal cells, 2DG has been studied as a
promising therapeutic agent that targets metabolic alterations of cancer cells (Ben Sahra et
al., 2010; Simons et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2006).

In addition to blocking glycolysis, 2DG has also been shown to inhibit N-linked
glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by interfering with mannose addition to the
oligosaccharides (Kurtoglu et al., 2007). This latter activity can be overcome by the addition
of excess mannose. Research indicates that 2DG inhibition of N-linked glycosylation is a
significant contributor to toxicity in multiple tumor cell lines (Kurtoglu et al., 2007).
Interference with N-linked glycosylation results in improper protein folding, leading to ER
stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and, if the stress is
sufficiently severe, – initiation of cell death pathways. The UPR-induced transcription factor
GADD153/CHOP is particularly important in ER stress-induced cell death, as both cells and
animals lacking CHOP are protected against a variety of insults that cause ER stress
(Oyadomari and Mori, 2004). ER stress can be triggered by a number of factors, including
aberrations in calcium regulation (Ma and Hendershot, 2004), hypoxic interference of proper
protein folding (Koumenis et al., 2002), increased synthesis of secretory proteins (Raden et
al., 2005), and inhibition of glycosylation (Kurtoglu et al., 2007). With prolonged or
pronounced ER stress, cells activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. While the
complete pathway that results in cell death following ER stress is still under investigation,
both Bim and Puma deficiency have been shown to protect from ER stress induced
apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro (Puthalakath et al., 2007; Reimertz et al., 2003).

Author Manuscript

It is well known that Bcl-2 family members are important regulators of apoptotic cell death
and consist of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members. The proapoptotic members are
divided into multidomain and BH3-only subgroups. Activating the multidomain members,
such as Bax and Bak, is considered a gateway to apoptotic cell death. Cell death is believed
to be initiated by the BH3-only subgroup members, among which are Bim and Puma
(Adams and Cory, 1998; Gross et al., 1999). The regulation of BH3-only proteins is
complex and involves both transcriptional as well as post-translational events that affect
their activity. The current view is that BH3-only proteins promote apoptosis by interacting
with prosurvival Bcl-2 family members (indirect activation) and/or activating multi-domain
proapoptotic members Bax or Bak (direct activation) (Kuwana et al., 2005; Letai et al.,
2002). Chemical compounds (BH3 mimetics) that trigger apoptotic signaling by
antagonizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have been developed and explored
therapeutically, since Bcl-2 activity is frequently elevated and causes drug resistance in
cancer cells (Letai et al., 2004).

One of these Bcl-2 antagonists, ABT-737, has high affinity to the anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-W, although not to Mcl-1 and A1 (Oltersdorf et al., 2005). Applying
ABT-737 with chemotherapeutic agents demonstrated a marked increase in response to
treatment in vitro and exhibited good activity as a single agent in small cell lung cancer
xenograft models (Oltersdorf et al., 2005). Multiple studies have shown that ABT-737 is
effective as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents targeting lymphoma (van
Delft et al., 2006), lymphoblastic leukemia (Kang et al., 2007), and small cell lung cancer
(Shoemaker et al., 2006). Considering deriviatives of ABT-737 are in early Phase clinical
trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov), exploring mechanisms and determining optimum combined
modality therapies involving these drugs is potentially of great clinical significance.

Author Manuscript

In the current study, we sought to determine the sensitivity of lymphoma cell lines to 2DG
and examine the involvement of the Bcl-2 family members in lymphoma resistance to 2DG.
In addition, we sought to determine whether combination therapy with ABT-737 would
further increase the efficacy of 2DG treatment in lymphoma. Understanding Bcl-2 family
proteins' involvement in 2DG-induced toxicity may lead to the development of combination
treatments that optimize the clinical response in patients with lymphoma.

Results
TCLs are uniformly sensitive to 2DG treatment

Author Manuscript

Murine T cell lymphoma cell lines (TCLs) were obtained from five independent thymic
lymphomas from Lck-Bax transgenic mice. These cell lines were treated with 20 mM 2deoxyglucose (2DG), and cell viability was monitored. All five cell lines demonstrated a
rapid decrease in viability following 2DG treatment (Fig. 1A). Importantly, freshly extracted
murine thymocytes were not sensitive to 2DG treatment compared to TCLs when monitored
for up to 24 hours following the treatment, suggesting selective sensitivity to 2DG treatment
by lymphomas and not normal cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether caspases were
activated following 2DG treatment, caspase 3 and PARP processing were examined in two
of the TCLs. Both cell lines showed cleavage of caspase 3 and near complete cleavage of its
downstream target PARP. Q-VD-OPh, a broad spectrum pan-caspase inhibitor, effectively
prevented the cleavage of both caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, Q-VD-OPh had
little effect on cell death following 2-DG treatment (Fig. 1D), suggesting that 2DG induces
cell death via caspase-independent pathway.

Author Manuscript

To examine whether the Bcl-2 family-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was
involved in 2DG killing, we examined whether 2DG induced Bax activation. Bax is known
to undergo conformational change and oligomerization, when the mitochondrial pathway is
activated for cell death (Smaili et al., 2003). We detected Bax conformational change by
FACS using the conformation specific antibody (Hsu and Youle, 1998). While 2DG
robustly induced Bax activation, caspase inhibition by Q-VD-OPh had only a modest effect
on Bax activation (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway is activated following 2DG treatment but that cell death is not dependent
on the efficient activation of caspases.

Inhibition of 2DG toxicity by Bcl-2

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

It is known that Bcl-2 inhibits Bax activation, thus we reasoned that overexpressing Bcl-2
would protect 2DG-treated lymphomas from death. TCL1 and TCL3 were therefore
generated to overexpress Bcl-2 (Fig. 3A). Elevated Bcl-2 completely protected from cell
death following 24 hours of 2DG treatment (Fig. 3A). Moreover, Bcl-2 overexpression in
TCLs treated with 2DG for 24 hours fully preserved their clonogenic proliferative ability
(Fig. 3B), suggesting that pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins mediate 2DG-induced cell death. As
predicted, Bax activation was effectively blocked by Bcl-2 in 2DG-treated TCLs (Fig. 3C).
To examine 2DG effects on energy metabolism, ATP levels were measured in TCLs and
TCL-Bcl-2 cells following 2DG treatment. TCL1 and TCL3 showed a 60-70% drop in ATP
levels as early as 30 min following 2DG treatment (Fig. 3D). This drop was not altered
when co-treated with Q-VD-OPh (not shown). Bcl-2 overexpression did not change 2DGcaused drop in ATP levels within the first two hours demonstrating that the effects on ATP
are not due to cell death (Fig. 3D).

Author Manuscript

In order to confirm the role of Bcl-2 in preventing cell death, we antagonized Bcl-2 by a
BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. As expected, ABT-737 sensitized both TCL1-Bcl-2 and TCL3Bcl-2 to 2DG (5 mM) treatment (Fig. 4A). Of note, ABT-737 alone was not toxic to these
cells. Importantly, TCL1 and TCL3 were also sensitized by ABT-737, suggesting that
endogenous levels of anti-apoptotic proteins in TCLs also limit the toxicity of 2DG (Fig.
4B). To determine whether Bax and/or Bak are required for 2DG-induced toxicity, IL-3
dependent hematopoietic lines deficient in both Bax and Bak were examined (Lum et al.,
2005). Double knockout (DKO) cells were resistant to 2DG, ABT-737, and their
combination (Fig. S1). Control cells expressing either Bax or Bak were sensitized to all of
these treatments. Of note, treatment with both 2DG and ABT-737 showed no toxicity in the
DKO cells while the Bax and Bak expressing cells had less than 10% viability. Taken
together, these results demonstrate 2DG-induced toxicity is dependent on Bax or Bak and in
cancer cells the toxicity can be enhanced by a BH3 mimetic.
Bim and Bmf upregulation following 2DG treatment

Author Manuscript

In order to determine which BH3-only proteins are involved in 2DG toxicity, we examined
the levels of multiple BH3-only members following 2DG treatment in TCLs and found that
both Bim and Bmf levels were elevated in TCLs with and without Bcl-2 overexpression at 6
and 24 hours after 2DG treatment, respectively (Fig. 5A, B). Other BH3-only members, Bid,
Bad and Puma, remained unchanged following 2DG treatment (Fig. 5B). Additionally,
examining the antiapoptotic protein levels of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 did not show apparent
changes following 2DG treatment (Fig. S2). To directly examine which BH3-only proteins
interact with Bcl-2 following 2DG treatment, Bcl-2 was immunoprecipitated from Bcl-2
overexpressing TCLs that were either untreated or treated with 2DG for 24 hours. The Bcl-2
antibodies effectively pulled down Bcl-2 protein as no Bcl-2 protein was detected in the
supernatant after immunoprecipitation (not shown). Of the BH3-only proteins examined,
only Bim and Bmf were bound to Bcl-2 under basal conditions (Fig. 5C, not shown). With
2DG treatment, Bcl-2-bound Bim and Bmf were greatly increased while Bid, Bad and Puma
remained unbound (not shown). Significantly, when cells were treated with ABT-737 for the
final 3 hours of the 24 hour 2DG treatment, the levels of Bim and Bmf that were bound by

Downregulation of Bim protein inhibits 2DG toxicity

Author Manuscript

Bcl-2 were markedly reduced (Fig. 5C). These results clearly demonstrate that 2DG toxicity
involves Bim and Bmf upregulation and binding to Bcl-2 and suggest they are involved in
the activation of Bax leading to cell death (Chen et al., 2005; Kuwana et al., 2005).

Role of ER stress in Bim upregulation

To determine if Bim is important in causing 2DG toxicity, shRNAs were developed to stably
downregulate Bim levels in TCLs. TCL1, TCL3, and TCL4 were stably transduced with
retroviral shBIM-containing plasmids. Of the four hairpins designed to downregulate Bim,
cell lines with shBIM279 and shBIM280 were studied due to their effective reduction of
Bim levels (> 50%) compared to the non-targeting vector and the empty vector control in all
three cell lines examined (Fig. 6A). As predicted, all three TCL lines expressing shBIM279
and shBIM280 were significantly protected from cell death at all concentrations of 2DG
examined relative to vector control (Fig. 6B). The shBIM277 vector, which failed to
downregulate Bim levels, had no inhibitory effect on cell death in each of the cell lines
examined. We conclude that Bim is a critical mediator of 2DG toxicity in TCLs.

Our data demonstrating that overexpression of Bcl-2 protects against 2DG without restoring
cellular ATP levels suggests an alternate pathway for 2DG-induced cell death. It has been
reported that 2DG causes ER stress through its interference with lipid-linked oligosaccharide
formation, and that this effect can be blocked by the addition of mannose (Kurtoglu et al.,
2007). ER stress induces cell death at least in part by upregulation of CHOP/GADD153,
which has been shown to upregulate Bim (Puthalakath et al., 2007). We therefore
hypothesized that 2DG induces apoptosis via ER stress-induced upregulation of GADD153,
which then leads to Bim upregulation. This hypothesis predicts that (1) mannose will inhibit
2DG-induced cell death; (2) 2DG will activate the UPR and mannose will block this
activation; and (3) 2DG will result in rapid upregulation of CHOP, which will correlate with
Bim upregulation and be blocked by mannose. The first of these predictions was confirmed
by demonstrating that mannose greatly delayed 2DG-induced cell killing (Fig. 7A). 2DG
treatment led to rapid upregulation (6 h) of UPR target genes, including Gadd153/Chop; and
Gadd34, which is downstream of Gadd153 (Marciniak et al., 2004); as well as the ERassociated degradation factor Edem and the ER chaperone Bip (not shown). Mannose
cotreatment effectively blocked upregulation of each of these genes. 2DG also caused
splicing of Xbp1 mRNA, which is induced by activation of the IRE1 pathway of the UPR
which was also effectively blocked by mannose (Fig. 7C). These results demonstrate that
2DG activates a canonical UPR that can be blocked by mannose. Importantly, mannose also
blocked upregulation of Bim by 2DG, while having no effect on ATP depletion (Fig. 7D).
Similarly, the upregulation of Bmf levels was inhibited by mannose indicating its
upregulation at least in part is due to the ER stress pathway (Fig. S3).
We noticed that mannose conferred little protection against 2DG at longer time points (Fig.
7A). Consistent with this observation, while mannose strongly blocked GADD153
upregulation both early and late during 2DG exposure, it failed to suppress Bim
upregulation at later time points in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (which were used because of
their lower sensitivity to longer 2DG treatment) (Fig. 7E). Mannose also had no effect on

cellular ATP levels at either time point. These results suggest that 2DG affects Bim in a
complex regulatory manner.
2DG induces toxicity in cell lines from B cell lymphomas that is enhanced by ABT-737 and
inhibited by mannose

Author Manuscript

To determine whether other hematopoietic cell lines show similar responses to 2DG and
ABT-737, two cell lines from Myc-induced B cell neoplasms were examined: iMyc Eμ-1
represents an immature lymphoblastic B cell lymphoma while iMycEμ-2 is a more mature
plasmacytoma (Han et al., 2006). Both cell lines were sensitive to 2DG, and the sensitivity
was enhanced by co-treatment with ABT-737. Furthermore, co-treatment with mannose
protected from 2DG-induced killing (Fig. 8). WEHI-231 cells, a well characterized
lymphoblastic B cell lymphoma line, were similarly sensitive to 2DG and protected by cotreatment with mannose (not shown). These findings demonstrate that B cell neoplasms are
sensitive to 2DG and suggest that the cell death pathways involved in 2DG toxicity are
similar to those in TCLs.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The property of cancer cells to utilize glycolysis more than normal cells was initially
observed by Otto Warburg. This acquisition by cancer cells occurred probably as an
adaptation to alter existing cell metabolism in a way that supports cell growth (Vander
Heiden et al., 2009). 2DG is a well known synthetic glucose analog that inhibits glycolysis
and interferes with protein folding. Despite numerous studies reporting the toxicity of 2DG
in cancer cells, its molecular mechanisms remain obscure (El Mjiyad et al., 2011). In
particular, the involvement of the Bcl-2 family proteins in 2DG-induced cell death has been
underexplored. Understanding the involvement of Bcl-2 family in 2DG-caused toxicity
could contribute to deciphering when 2DG could be applied clinically, since antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family genes are known to be elevated in cancers and affect treatment outcomes by
increasing cell resistance to drugs (Letai et al., 2004). The need to understand the pathway
of 2DG toxicity in cells is urgent, since 2DG is in Phase I clinical trials
(www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Author Manuscript

Our findings indicate that 2DG toxicity in TCLs involves proapoptotic Bax activation,
suggesting that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is involved in 2DG-induced killing.
However, efficient inhibition of caspases, as demonstrated by lack of cleavage of caspase 3
and its target PARP, did not prevent or even delay cell death following 2DG treatment. This
demonstrates that cell death is not dependent on the activation of caspases. Other studies
have shown that death does not always depend on efficient caspase activation, and under
these conditions death may be due to energy loss involving mitochondrial dysfunction
(Cheng et al., 2001; Chipuk and Green, 2005). Our results demonstrating the dramatic
decrease of ATP levels following 2DG treatment suggest a similar pathway may be involved
in cell death in lymphoma cells; but the fact that manipulations capable of rescuing cells
from 2DG-induced cell death (i.e., Bcl-2 overexpression and mannose) did not reverse the
changes in ATP, argues that ATP depletion may regulate the toxicity of 2DG through
alterations in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway involving the Bcl-2 family.

Bcl-2, on the other hand, did show effective protection from 2DG treatment both by
membrane integrity assays as well as clonogenic survival while having no immediate effect
on preventing the depletion of ATP levels. Both Bax activation and Bcl-2 protection support
the involvement of the Bcl-2 family proteins in 2DG toxicity in these cells. Since BH3-only
family members act upstream of the multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins (Cheng et al., 2001;
Huang and Strasser, 2000), we asked if ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic, would sensitize TCLs to
2DG treatment. Indeed, while not toxic when used alone, ABT-737 sensitized TCLs and
Bcl-2 overexpressing TCLs to low doses of 2DG treatment, suggesting the sequestration of
critical BH3-only members by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Interestingly, caspase inhibition
did not significantly protect from cell death of TCLs despite effective inhibition of caspase 3
cleavage. This prompted us to examine whether the cell death required Bax/Bak or perhaps
occurred by necrosis or autophagy, pathways that have previously been shown to be blocked
by Bcl-2 (Kane et al., 1995; Liang et al., 1999; Saeki et al., 2000). 2DG-induced toxicity
was shown to require Bax or Bak as Bax/Bak DKO cells were highly resistant to this
treatment, wherein isogenic control cells expressing either Bax or Bak were sensitive to
2DG, ABT-737, and their combination. These results demonstrate that Bax and/or Bak are
required for 2DG induced toxicity.

Author Manuscript

2DG treatment increased both Bim and Bmf levels, while Bid, Bad, Puma were unchanged.
We also found that the levels of both Bim and Bmf that were associated with Bcl-2 were
increased following 2DG treatment. Significantly, the interaction of Bcl-2 with either Bim
or Bmf was disrupted by a BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, which sensitized the cells to 2DG
toxicity. Most likely, the liberated Bim and Bmf acted on other anti-apoptotics and/or
Bax/Bak to induce cell death. Given a more pronounced Bim upregulation in TCLs and
previous studies showing that Bim deficiency protects lymphoid cells from cell death (Egle
et al., 2004), we focused on studying the role of Bim in 2DG-caused toxicity. Indeed,
downregulation of Bim promoted cell survival during 2DG treatment, indicating that Bim is
an essential contributor to 2DG-induced cell death. Cells remained somewhat sensitive to
high concentrations of 2DG, suggesting other BH3-only members may also participate.
Since Bmf was upregulated and bound to Bcl-2 following 2DG treatment, we favor this as a
likely contributor of the observed cell death.

Author Manuscript

Since both Bim and Bmf are activated following ER stress, we examined whether 2DG
altered GADD153 levels in TCLs. GADD153 is a transcription factor known to be
upregulated following ER stress and can directly activate transcription of Bim. Consistent
with this model, we found that GADD153 protein levels were markedly induced following
2DG treatment and this induction was independent of Bcl-2 expression. Upregulation of
GADD153 is most likely the consequence of ER stress and UPR activation by 2DG, as other
measures of UPR activation were also detected, including induction of other target genes
(Gadd34, Bip, Edem) and splicing of Xbp1 mRNA. That mannose blocked UPR activation,
suppressed Bim upregulation, and inhibited 2DG-induced cell death suggests that 2DGinduced death occurs at least partly through the UPR-CHOP-Bim axis, particularly during
early time points. However, when the ER stress response was alleviated by the addition of
mannose, Bim upregulation was not prevented in TCL-Bcl-2 cells. This prompted us to
speculate that at early time points, 2DG-induced Bim upregulation is ER stress/GADD153

dependent while prolonged 2DG treatment leads to marked upregulation of Bim that is
induced differently. Since mannose effectively blocks GADD153 upregulation without
altering the drop in ATP levels, we conclude that mannose selectively blocks 2DG-induced
ER stress without blocking its effect on energy metabolism. Based on this, we propose the
ER stress response is a rate limiting factor in 2DG-induced death and suggest that 2DG may
act synergistically with other agents that may lead to ER stress. One such treatment reagent
is bortezomib (Velcade), an FDA approved proteasome inhibitor known to induce ER stress
(Dasmahapatra et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

Our findings are important for several reasons. First, both 2DG and ABT-737 (or analogs)
are in clinical trials, and additional information about how these reagents work may allow
the development of a biochemical rationale for improving the efficacy of these agents in
clinical applications. Second, combining 2DG and ABT-737 to induce cellular toxicity is a
novel finding that could be utilized to sensitize otherwise drug resistant tumor cells. This
effect could be particularly applicable for tumors with high levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members. Third, understanding the Bcl-2 member family involvement in 2DGinduced toxicity is an important contribution to deciphering the mechanism and improving
the understanding of this long-studied reagent in cancer biology.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

Five independently derived murine Lck-Bax38/1 thymic tumor cell samples (van de
Wetering et al., 2007) were cultured in Advanced RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 250 μg/L Fungizone
Amphotericin (Invitrogen) (complete medium). B cell lymphomas and hematopoietic lines
doubly deficient in Bax and Bak were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, 50 μM 2mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and
95% air. Cells were cultured for up to 4 months and then another aliquot was thawed and
utilized. No significant changes in the properties of the cells were observed over this time.
Thymocytes were isolated from C57/BL6 mice and minced into a single cell suspension
between two frosted glass slides. The erythrocytes were removed by 5-10 minute incubation
at room temperature in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.83% NH4Cl, pH 7.2). The
cells were then pelleted and resuspended in complete medium as described above, and used
for viability experiments.
Viability assays

Cell viability and cell count were determined utilizing a Guava PCA cell analyzer (Guava
Technologies Inc.). Guava assay distinguishes between viable and non-viable cells based on
the differential permeability of DNA-binding dyes in the ViaCount Reagent (Millipore). In
brief, 10 μL of cells were added to 50 μL of Guava ViaCount reagent and allowed to stain
for 5–20 min. Just prior to placement in the instrument, the cells were diluted with 40 μL of
PBS and mixed, and the data were acquired. Experiments were performed in duplicate or
triplicate, and the data represent the mean ± S.D. for each sample. For Propidium Iodide (PI)

cytometer.
Clonogenic Survival Assay
Clonogenic survival of TCLs was performed by plating cells by limiting dilution into 96well plates. Briefly, cells were treated as indicated, pelleted and resuspended in culture
medium. Total cells were counted with the Guava PCA system and then plated out at
limiting dilution of 1-5 cells/well in 96-well round bottom plates. The number of positive
wells was recorded after 9-10 days of growth. For each experiment samples were performed
in triplicate and the data were normalized to the clonogenic survival of the untreated cells.
Activated Bax Staining by Flow Cytometry

Cells were pelleted and fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room
temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 μL of
blocking buffer (PBS with 0.01% digitonin, 5 μg/mL anti-FC, and 10% normal rat serum).
Each sample was split in half and either stained with anti-Bax antibody (clone 6A7;
eBioscience) or isotype control (clone P3; eBioscience) at 2.5 μg/sample. Cells were stained
for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and stained with 1 μg/100 μL fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min. The cells were
then washed with PBS, 0.01% digitonin prior to staining for DNA content with PI and
RNase as previously described (Rathmell et al., 2003). Cells were acquired and analyzed on
a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Doublets and subdiploid cells were excluded in
analysis. Gates were adjusted so that less than 1% of the cells were positive with the isotype

Inhibitor (Roche, 11873580001) and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were incubated 30 min on ice, after
which NaCl (200 mM final) and CHAPS (1% final) were added. Samples were vortexed
well, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000g × 15 min). The
protein concentrations of the original lysates were determined using the DC Bradford assay.
Protein A/G beads (50 μL/sample, Santa Cruz, sc-2003) were washed with IP Wash buffer
(200 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPS in IP lysis buffer) and 120 μg of lysates were added to the
beads followed by the addition of the Bcl-2 antibody (6C8, Pharmingen) (1 μg/sample) in a
total volume of 100 μL. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C on the 3D mixer. Original
lysates were stored at -20°C for controls (1.2 μg/μL). The cleared supernatants were
collected after pelleting the beads (2,000g × 5 min) and used to confirm complete
immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 in each sample. Beads were washed (5×) in IP Wash Buffer
and resuspended with 40 μL of sample buffer containing SDS. Samples were boiled for 5
min and loaded onto Western blot gels with equivalent amounts of lysates and supernatant
and the beads loaded at 1.5 to 2 times the equivalent volume.

Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% NP40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS in PBS containing
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma, P8340)), incubated on ice for 30 min, pelleted
at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. The protein measurements were determined by DC
Bradford Protein Assay. Samples were brought to equal concentrations, mixed with the
loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5min, loaded and separated on a
gradient (4-20%) Tris–Glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in a 5% milk/PBS Tween solution and
incubated overnight at 4°C with a polyclonal antibody against the desired protein. The
membrane was washed three times over 15 min in PBS Tween and then incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with a secondary antibody. The membrane was again washed three times
over 15 min in PBS Tween and then analyzed with ECL or ECL+ kit. The following
antibodies were used: Bad and CHOP/GADD153 (Santa Cruz, sc-943, sc-575); Bcl-2
(Pharmingen, 15131S); β actin, Bim (Sigma, A4700, B7929); Bmf (Lifespan, LS-c4126);
Bid (R&D, AF860); caspase 3, PARP, Puma (Cell Signaling, 9664, 9542, 4976); and
GAPDH (AbCam Inc, ab9484). The quantitation of protein ratios was assessed by the
Bioimaging Systems, Ultra-Violet Products (UVP).
Cell line transduction

Author Manuscript

TCL-Bcl-2 cells were generated using a HIV based lentiviral system with the pLA-CMV
plasmid containing the cDNA for human Bcl-2 and puromycin resistance as previously
described (Budanov et al., 2004). In brief, HEK 293T cells were transfected with both a 5
plasmid packaging mix (pTRE-GAG-PRO-PRE-polyA, pCMV-VpR-RT-IN-polyA, pCMVVSV-G-polyA, pCMV-TEToff-polyA, and pCMV-TAT-REV) and the target plasmid
pLACMV-Bcl-2. Briefly, the lentiviral packaging plasmids and the target plasmid were
resuspended in EC buffer (Qiagen) and Enhacer (Qiagen), vortexed and incubated for 5 min
at room temperature. Next, Effectene (Qiagen) was added to the plasmid mix, vortexed and
incubated at room temperature for 20 min. This new plasmid mix was used to transfect 293T
cells in fresh complete media. Every 12 to 18 h for 2.5 days following the initial
transfection, virus particles were harvested from the 293T cells and the medium was filtered
with a 0.22 μm syringe filter (Millipore), polybrene was added (4 μg/mL, Sigma, 107-689)
and then added to the TCLs. Transduced TCLs were then selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin
(Invitrogen) for 7-10 days in culture.

TCL shBIM cell lines were generated using microRNA-adapted retroviral system (Thermo
Scientific) with the MSCV-LMP plasmid containing shRNAmir inserts and puromycin gene.
The inserts were designed on RNAi-Central- RNAi Oligo Retriever (http://
katahdin.mssm.edu/homepage/siRNA/RNAi.cgi?type=shRNA). Each of the four designed
inserts (shBIM277-280) contained a ‘sense’ sequence of 22 nucleotides in length from the
coding sequence of Bim (accession NM_207680.2): 5′AGTTCTGAGTGTGACAGAGAAG-3′ (start position 252), 5′CACCCTCAAATGGTTATCTTAC-3′ (start position 753), 5′CACAAGGAGGGTGTTTGCAAAT-3′ (start position 710), 5′CTCAGTGCAATGGCTTCCATAC-3′ (start position 597). The insertions were confirmed
by sequencing, and positive clones were further used to generate shBIM cell lines. Briefly,

Ψ-2 packaging plasmid and target plasmid were resuspended in calcium phosphate
containing BES buffer as described previously (Chen and Okayama, 1987). The mix was
incubated at room temperature for 15 min and used to transfect tsA201 cells. Viral particles
were collected at 48 h and 72 h following transfection, pooled and polybrene (4 μg/mL) was
added to enhance transduction. TCLs were transduced by spinfection at 700g for 2 h at room
temperature. Following centrifugation, cells were pelleted and resuspended in fresh media.
Cells were selected with puromycin as described above.
ATP measurements

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated under varying conditions. At indicated time
points, cells were mixed and an aliquot was taken for both Guava Viability and ATP
measurements. ATP levels were measured in triplicate utilizing ATP bioluminescent cell
assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, FLASC) as described by the manufacturer. ATP levels were
normalized per viable cell and then normalized to untreated control sample being 100%.
Bioluminescence was measured in white plates using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader.
RNA analysis

Author Manuscript

Conventional RT-PCR for Xbp1, and quantitative RT-PCR for Chop, Bip, and Gadd34 was
performed as described previously (Rutkowski et al., 2006) with the levels normalized to
both Gapdh and Hprt. Briefly, total RNA was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen). For qRT-PCR,
0.5 μg of RNA was programmed into a 10 ml cDNA synthesis reaction (iScript, BioRad),
which was then diluted and used for subsequent qPCR analysis (iQ Superscript, BioRad).
The specificity and efficiency of all primer pairs were exhaustively validated before use.
Spliced and unspliced Xbp1 mRNA were detected using the Superscript III/Platinum Taq
RT kit (Invitrogen) and primers flanking the 26 base intron. Data represent average mRNA
levels from three independent samples.
