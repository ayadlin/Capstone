Abstract
Fusion genes play important roles in tumorigenesis. The identification of the high-frequency TMPRSS2 fusion
with ERG and other ETS family genes in prostate cancer highlights the importance of fusion genes in solid tumor
development and progression. However, the mechanisms leading to these fusions are unclear. We investigated
whether androgen, through stimulating its receptor, could promote spatial genome reorganization and
contribute to the generation of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. We show that treatment with androgen can induce
the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in both malignant and nonmalignant prostate epithelial cells. Although the fusion
could be detected in malignant cells following 24-hour treatment, prolonged exposure to androgen was required
to detect the fusion transcript in nonmalignant cells. We associated the fusion incidence with genetic factors,
including androgen-induced gene proximity, androgen receptor exon1 CAG repeat length and expression of the
PIWIL1 gene. This study demonstrates that fusions can be induced prior to malignant transformation and
generation of the fusion is associated with both gene proximity and loss of the ability to prevent double-strand
breaks. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9544–8. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Gene fusion events are a hallmark of human hematologic
and soft tissue malignancies and can be associated with tumor
development, progression, and therapeutic response (1, 2).
Recently, gene fusions involving the ETS transcription factor
gene family members, including ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5,
have been identified as common events in prostate cancer and
highlight the importance of fusion genes in the development
and progression of epithelial cancers (2–4). However, the
mechanism underlying the development and recurrence of
these fusion genes is not yet fully understood.
Androgen, through stimulating its receptor and activating
downstream cellular processes, is essential for normal prostate
development and prostate cancer cell proliferation (5). Upon
androgen binding, androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear transcription factor, is activated and regulates the transcription of a
number of genes including TMPRSS2 (5, 6). The TMPRSS2:ERG
fusion, detected in approximately 50% of prostate cancers, is

the most common fusion gene found in human malignances
(2, 4). This fusion results in the overexpression of the ERG
oncogene from the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter.
Recently, estrogen has been shown to induce rapid chromosome interactions involving estrogen receptor transcription
units (7). Transcriptional activity can lead to the proximity of
distal genes (7–9) and gene proximity of fusion partner genes
has been associated with fusion events (6, 8–10). As androgen
stimulates the expression of TMPRSS2, it may induce the
proximity and fusion of TMPRSS2 and its fusion partners. Here,
we show that AR activity promotes TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in
nonmalignant cells by long-term androgen treatment of
immortalized prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, induced
fusion events are associated with both gene proximity and
expression of PIWIL1, which is thought to have a role in
protecting cells from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).

Materials and Methods
Cultured cells and clinical samples
Cell lines, including the SV40-immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines PNT1a and PNT2 (11) (obtained from Norman
Maitland and Colin Cooper, respectively) and prostate cancer
cell lines LNCaP, DU145, PC3, 22RV1, and VCaP (ATCC), were
routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media
(DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. They were tested
and authenticated in August 2010, using the ABI AmpF/
TSR Identifiler kit. Normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC)
(Lonza) were cultured in Clonetics PrEBM medium (Lonza).
Primary prostate cancer samples were obtained from The
Barts and The London Hospital NHS Trust and Whipps Cross
Hospital in London with ethical approval and patient consent.

Induced Fusion in Prostate Epithelial Cells

Dihydrotestosterone treatment
For colocalization analysis following short-term dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment, cells were cultured in RPMI
medium with 10% carbon-stripped serum (Autogen Bioclear)
for 24 hours. Cells were either treated for 3 hours with
100 nmol/L of DHT or cultured under the same conditions
without DHT. For long-term treatment, cells were cultured in
DMEM with 10% standard fetal bovine serum and additional
300 or 3,000 nmol/L of DHT. Medium was changed twice
weekly and fresh DHT was added each time.
AR microsatellite analysis
AR CAG repeat length was determined by microsatellite
analysis. PCR using primers (AR_FAM_F: 50 -FAM-ACCCAGAGGCCGCGAGCGCAG and AR_R: 50 -TTGCTGTTCCTCATCCAGGA) (Sigma), flanking the AR CAG repeat in exon1
was performed. PCR product was run on 3730xl ABI sequencer
and analyzed by Genemapper v 4.0 (Applied Biosystems).
DNA sequencing
PCR product was sequenced using the 3730xl ABI sequencer. Primer pairs TMPRSS2_F (50 -GGAGCGCCGCCTGGAG)
and ERG_R (50 -CCATATTCTTTCACCGCCCAC), and AR_F
(50 -ACCCAGAGGCCGCGAGCGCAG) and AR_R (Sigma), were
used to confirm TMPRSS2:ERG fusion products and CAG
repeat length, respectively.
Gene expression analysis
RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was
synthesized from RNA, using Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols.
Relative mRNA levels were determined using predesigned TaqMan gene expression assays targeting PIWIL1
(Hs00380305_m1) and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) (Applied
Biosystems) and quantified by quantitative RT-PCR analysis using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence detector
(Applied Biosystems).
TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts were detected by nested
RT-PCR using primers described previously (12). cDNA
synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA was used as the starting
template.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization
TMPRSS2 and ERG colocalization analysis was performed
using standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol with 2 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), RP1135C4 (TMPRSS2) and RP11-476D17 (ERG). BAC DNA was
amplified using GenomiPhi amplification V2 kit (GE Healthcare) and labeled with digoxigenin and biotin, respectively,
using the BioPrime labeling kit (Invitrogen). A minimum of
100 nuclei were counted per sample. Induced proximity was
quantified and represented as the percentage of colocalized
signal pairs.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle distribution was established using a FACScalibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cells were harvested after
24 hours and stained using propidium iodide (50 mg/mL). The
distribution of cell-cycle phases was quantified using the

www.aacrjournals.org

WinMDI v2.8 program (http://facs.scripps.edu/http://facs.
scripps.edu/).
g-H2AX foci counting
g-H2AX foci were detected using a monoclonal anti-phospho-histone H2A.X antibody (clone JBW301; Millipore). Cells
exhibiting more than 5 foci were considered positive. A
minimum of 100 cells were counted.
Cell transfection
LNCaP cells were transfected with PIWIL1 expression plasmid (Origene), using Nucleofector Kit R (Lonza) according to
the manufacture's protocol.
Statistical analysis
Differences in the frequency of colocalization signals
between groups were compared using a 2-tailed chi-square
test. The values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results and Discussion
Androgen can induce TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in
both malignant and nonmalignant prostate cells
Prostate cancer develops years after androgen levels peak,
indicating that long-term androgen exposure may be required
in prostate cancer development. Thus, we treated immortalized nonmalignant cell lines, PNT1a and PNT2, continuously
with high doses (300 and 3,000 nmol/L) of the AR ligand DHT.
After 5-month treatment, we detected the fusion transcript in
both cell lines treated with 3,000 nmol/L of DHT and PNT2
cells treated with 300 nmol/L of DHT, using nested RT-PCR
(Fig. 1A). For both PNT1a and PNT2, sequencing of the PCR
products revealed the most common fusion isoform; exon1 of
TMPRSS2 fused to exon4 of ERG (6, 12) (Fig. 1B). No fusion was
detected in cells cultured without DHT. The cell-cycle distribution and DNA damage levels (as determined by g-H2AX
formation) were unaffected by the long-term treatment (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). The fusion was induced more
frequently in cells treated with higher doses (Fig. 1A), suggesting that induction is dosage associated. We treated cells
with 100 nmol/L of DHT for 24 hours and detected fusion

transcripts in LNCaP cells but not in PrEC, PNT1a, and PNT2
cells (Fig. 2A and B). As the long pathogenesis of prostate
cancer in vivo suggests that physiologic DHT doses would be
unable to induce TMPRSS2:ERG in the short term, the doses
used exceeded normal physiologic levels, similar to previous
studies (6, 13, 14).
During the course of this study, it was reported that DHT
treatment could induce fusion events (6, 14). However, as cells
were treated for a maximum of 24 hours in the previous
studies, DNA-damaging agents were used in combination with
DHT to induce the fusion events (6, 14). With DHT alone, the
fusion could be detected in LNCaP cells but not in PrEC cells
(6). This was confirmed by our short-term treatment of
nonmalignant cells and may explain why long-term treatment
is required to induce the fusion in immortalized prostate
epithelial cells. Our finding that TMPRSS2:ERG can be induced
in premalignant prostate epithelial cells is important and
suggests that androgen-induced fusions represent an event
that can occur prior to prostate cancer development rather
than as a secondary genetic change after the cancer is
established. Although TMPRSS2:ERG has previously been
observed in nonmalignant prostate cells (12) and cancer
precursor lesions (15–18), our results suggest that the fusion
may be a consequence of long-term androgen exposure.

DHT stimulation of AR induces TMPRSS2 and ERG
spatial gene proximity
To confirm the role of AR in the dynamic reorganization of
chromosomes, we investigated the effect of AR stimulation on
TMPRSS2 and ERG gene proximity. Using FISH, we observed
that following DHT stimulation (3 hours), TMPRSS2 and ERG
colocalization was significantly increased in LNCaP, PNT1a,
and PNT2 cells (9.9%–17.6%, P < 0.01; 12.6%–23.5%, P < 0.01;
and 12.7%–19.8%, P < 0.05, respectively) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S2). However, AR-negative DU145 cells showed
no increase in TMPRSS2 and ERG colocalization (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table S2). These observations are consistent
with recent publications (6, 14) and confirm that DHT-stimulated gene fusions are associated with induced gene proximity
through the AR pathway. PNT1a, PNT2, and LNCaP cells
showed an inverse correlation of AR CAG repeat length
(n ¼ 20, 19, and 25 for PNT1a, PNT2, and LNCaP, respectively)
with the rate of DHT-induced TMPRSS2 and ERG proximity,
although this correlation needs to be confirmed in a larger

TMPRSS2:ERG occurs less frequently in Chinese prostate
cancer samples than in Western prostate cancer samples
(19). Interestingly, compared with Western males, Chinese
men have lower androgen levels and a longer CAG repeat
length (20, 21). This difference may account for the low
incidence of prostate cancer in China.

TMPRSS2:ERG is associated with AR activity
Our data, indicating that the frequency of androgeninduced TMPRSS2:ERG fusion events is dose dependent, suggest that the fusion is more likely induced in individuals with
high prostate DHT levels. Alternatively, it is possible that a
high frequency of fusion events may occur as a result of
increased AR activity. As the length of CAG repeats in exon1
of the AR gene varies in individuals and is inversely correlated
with AR activity (5), we investigated whether this is associated
with the occurrence of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. We determined repeat length in 40 prostate cancer clinical samples, for
each of which the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status has been
determined by RT-PCR. Overall, repeat length of the fusionpositive cases (mean ¼ 20.3) showed a trend to be shorter than
fusion-negative cases (mean ¼ 21.3) (Supplementary Table S1
and Fig. S3). However, this difference is not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.14). A large series of samples should be
investigated to verify this. We have recently shown that

sample set. Given our observation that TMPRSS2:ERG is more
readily induced in cancer cells than in nonmalignant cells, it is
interesting to find that the induced frequency of TMPRSS2 and
ERG colocalization is lower in LNCaP cells (17.6%) than in
PNT1a and PNT2 cells (23.5% and 19.8%, respectively) (Fig. 3).
This suggests that cells with additional oncogenic abnormalities may be more susceptible to chromosome rearrangements
than nonmalignant cells.
TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion is associated
with PIWIL1 expression
The observation that gene colocalization and fusion frequencies are not directly correlated suggests that the fusion
rate is also dependent on other factors. In a recent study,
the expression of PIWIL1 was reported to be reduced in
LNCaP cells (6). We investigated PIWIL1 expression in our
samples and found low PIWIL1 expression in LNCaP cells
and high expression in PrEC cells (Fig. 4). Interestingly, an
intermediate level of expression was observed in PNT1a and
PNT2 cells and expression in the fusion-positive VCaP cells
could not be detected using the same PCR conditions. This
suggests that PIWIL1 expression is inversely correlated with
the ability to induce TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and also indicates
that PNT1a and PNT2 cells are better protected against
chromosome rearrangements than LNCaP cells. Interestingly, in PNT1a and PNT2 cells, PIWIL1 expression was
reduced following long-term DHT exposure (Fig. 4A). When
considering PIWIL1 expression (Fig. 4A) in combination with
the frequency of induced gene proximity and gene fusion
(Figs. 1 and 3) for each cell line, it seems that the prevention

of DSBs by PIWIL1 may be the main determinant in fusion
frequency. Overexpression of PIWIL1 in LNCaP cells was
sufficient to prevent DHT-induced TMPRSS2:ERG fusion
(Fig. 4B and C).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that TMPRSS2:ERG
fusion is an early event in prostate carcinogenesis and can be
induced by androgen in a dose-dependent manner. The
incidence of TMPRSS2:ERG events is associated with androgen-induced gene proximity as well as the reduced expression
of genes, such as PIWIL1, which encode proteins that help
protect the genome from DNA damage. The genetic factors,
shown here to contribute to the incidence of TMPRSS2:ERG
induction, may be applicable to the induction of other gene
fusion events.
