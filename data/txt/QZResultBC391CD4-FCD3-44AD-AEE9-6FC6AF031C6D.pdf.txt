ABSTRACT
Purpose: Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a serine/threonine kinase
involved in cancer development. Herein, we demonstrated the role of GSK-3β in
endometrial cancer (EC) and identified new therapeutic targets.
Results: GSK-3β was overexpressed in EC tissues, and was positively correlated
with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging,
dedifferentiation, and myometrial infiltration depth. Besides, GSK-3β overexpression
predicted lower cumulative and relapse-free survival rate. si-GSK- 3β transfection
suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis
through downregulating NF-kB, Cyclin D1 and MMP9 expression whereas upregulating
P21 expression. Bioinformatic predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed
that GSK-3β was a possible target of miR-129. MiR-129 transfection reduced GSK-3β
expression, and exhibited the same trend as si-GSK-3β transfection in cell function
experiments. The nude mouse xenograft assay showed that miR-129 overexpression
may suppress tumor growth through downregulating GSK-3β expression. Further
studies showed that AZD1080, a GSK-3β inhibitor, could also inhibit EC cell
proliferation, migration and invasion, while induced cell apoptosis through modulating
relevant genes downstream of GSK-3β signaling.
Experimental Design: GSK-3β expression was determined in EC tissue and normal
endometrial tissues by immunohistochemistry. After GSK-3β down-regulation by
si-GSK-3β, microRNA-129 mimic transfection or GSK-3β inhibitor exposure, EC cell
phenotypes and related molecules were examined.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate for the first time that GSK-3β may be a
novel and important therapeutic target for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.
GSK-3β inhibitor AZD1080 may be an effective drug for treating endometrial
carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a
multifunctional kinase, which inhibit glycogen synthesis
by inhibiting glycogen synthase through phosphorylation.
More than 40 proteins are substrates of GSK-3β, including
transcription factors, cell cycle/survival regulators, and
oncogenic/proto-oncogenic proteins [4–5], which correlated
with various signaling pathways and cellular functions
[6]. GSK-3β has been investigated as a therapeutic target
for numerous human diseases, including cancer, because

Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most
common gynecological malignancies, and its incidence
has increased remarkably [1–2]. The 5-year survival is
approximately 25–45% for stage III and IV cancers [3].
Therefore, it is essential to dissect the underlying molecular
mechanisms of tumorigenesis and development of EC for
better diagnosis and treatment.

si-GSK-3β transfection suppressed EC cell
proliferation, increased cell apoptosis and
inhibited cell migration and invasion

of its diverse cellular functions [7]. Qiao et al. reported
that GSK-3β was upregulated at both mRNA and protein
levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens, and
the overexpression of p-Ser9-GSK-3β was associated with
the poor prognosis [8]. Zeng et al. reported that GSK-3β
overexpression indicates poor prognosis of non-small cell
lung cancer [9]. However, the role of GSK-3β in endometrial
carcinoma is still unclear; therefore, we analyzed the
potential molecular mechanism of GSK-3β in endometrial
carcinoma and explored its function for the diagnosis and
therapy of EC.

si-GSK-3β was transfected into cells, and the
expression of GSK-3β was significantly downregulated
at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2A). MTT
assay showed a significant reduction of cell viability at
48 and 72 h after transfection with si-GSK-3β compared
with the control group (P < 0.05; Figure 2B). Apoptosis
assays demonstrated that cell apoptosis rates were elevated
48 h after transfection with si-GSK-3β compared with
control group (P < 0.05; Figure 2C). Wound-healing assay
showed that cells exhibited a slower closing of the scratch
wound after transfection with si-GSK-3β compared with
the control group (P < 0.05; Figure 3A). Transwell assays
showed that cells transfected with si-GSK-3β had a
reduced invasive ability compared with the control group
(P < 0.05; Figure 3B).

RESULTS
Expression of GSK-3β correlates with
pathogenesis and aggressiveness of EC
The expression levels of GSK-3β were detected in EC
samples and normal samples by Immunohistochemistry. As
shown in Figure 1, GSK-3β expression levels were stronger
in EC tissues (Figure 1D–1I) compared with normal samples
(Figure 1A–1C, details could be found in Table 1). GSK- 3β
expression was positively correlated with FIGO staging (I
& II vs. III & IV, P = 0.006), dedifferentiation (Well &
Mod vs. Poor, P = 0.006), and the depth of myometrial
infiltration (< 1/2 vs. ≥ 1/2, P = 0.026). Besides, GSK3β overexpression was corrected with poor cumulative
and relapse-free survival rate (Figure 1M and 1N,
P = 0.017). Details could be found in Table 2.

NF-kB, Cyclin D1, MMP9, and P21 expression is
regulated by si-GSK-3β transfection
Following transfection of si-GSK-3β, qRT-PCR and
Western blot analysis showed decreased levels of NF-kB,
Cyclin D1 and MMP9 at the mRNA (P < 0.05; Figure 4A)
and protein (Figure 4B) levels, however, P21 expression
increased at the mRNA and protein levels compared with
the negative control.

Figure 1: Expression of GSK-3β correlates with pathogenesis and aggressiveness of EC. GSK-3β expression levels were

stronger in EC tissues (D–I) compared with normal samples (A–C). Besides, GSK-3β overexpression was corrected with lower cumulative
and relapse-free survival rate (M and N).

concentration of 1.0, 2.0, 4.0μM was used for further study

increased P21 expression when exposed to AZD1080.

GSK-3β phosphorylates various proteins involved
in glycogen synthesis, gene expression, cell migration, cell
cycle, cellular architectural pathways, and oncogenesis
[10–13]. Our results showed that GSK-3β expression was
significantly higher in EC tissues than in normal endometrial
tissues. In addition, GSK-3β expression was positively
related to histological differentiation, FIGO stage, and the

depth of myometrial infiltration, which together demonstrate
a poor prognosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that GSK-3β
may play an oncogenic role in EC. Thus, we transfected siRNA GSK-3β constructs to deplete GSK- 3β levels in order
to observe changes in the occurrence and development
of EC cells using a series of functional cell assays. The
results demonstrated that depletion of GSK- 3β suppressed
the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells, and
promoted the apoptosis of EC cells. Taken together, our
results demonstrated an inhibition of EC after GSK-3β was

depleted. Shi et al. reported that CD151 overexpression
upregulated the expression of MMP9 through the PI3K/
Akt/GSK-3β/Snail pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma
[14]. A previous study showed that the downregulation
of cyclin D1 degradation through the constitutive active
AKT/GSK-3β pathway inhibited cell proliferation [15].
Deng et al. found that inhibition of GSK- 3β suppressed
NF-kB activity [16]. Additionally, Yohn et al. reported that
GSK-3β inhibition causes an increase in p21 in bladder
cells [17]. Therefore, we detected the expression levels of

NF-kB, Cyclin D1, MMP9, and P21 after transfection with
si-GSK-3β and found that NF-kB, Cyclin D1 and MMP9
expression were downregulated, whereas P21 expression
was upregulated. Thus, we hypothesize that GSK-3β can
promote the carcinogenesis and progression of EC and that
downregulating GSK-3β may hinder the development of
EC cells through regulating a series of related downstream
genes. Therefore, GSK-3β may be a new therapeutic target
of EC.
Next, we investigated the possible upstream
regulatory genes of GSK-3β. MiRNAs are a class of small
non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression
at the post-transcriptional level [18–26]. MiRNA 129 has
been reported to have great potential as a therapeutic agent
in select tumors including bladder cancer [27], colorectal
cancer [28], gastric cancer [29], and lung cancer [30],
and may inhibits cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and
invasion through targeting relevant genes such as ETS1
[31], CDK6 [32], PAK5 [33]. Our predicted seed region
in the 3′ UTR of GSK-3β revealed that GSK-3β is a target
of miR-129, which was also convinced by our luciferase
reporter assay results. Therefore, we transfected miR-129
mimics into EC cells and found that the GSK-3β expression

both at the mRNA and protein level was downregulated.
Further experiments showed that miR-129 overexpression
also suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion of
cells, and promoted the apoptosis of EC cells, which were
completely in line with our si-GSK-3β experimental results.
Next, we detected the mRNA and protein expression levels
of NF-kB, Cyclin D1, MMP9, and P21 in EC cells following
transfection of miR-129. We found that NF-kB, Cyclin D1
and MMP9 expression was downregulated, whereas, P21
expression was upregulated, likewise, these results were
similar to our si-GSK-3β transfected cells. Therefore,
we hypothesize that GSK-3β may be downregulated by
miR- 129 in order to suppress the development of EC. Lastly,
we performed nude mice xenograft assays to elucidate if
miR-129 could affect the expression level of GSK-3β and
further influence the tumorigenicity and development of EC
in vivo. As predicted, miR-129 overexpression significantly
downregulated GSK-3β expression and suppressed
tumorigenicity and slowed down the progression of EC
in vivo. These results demonstrate the oncogenic role of
GSK-3β in EC. The downregulation of GSK-3β is an
effective way to inhibit EC tumorigenesis and progression,
and miR-129 is an effective and important miR.

group, and was concentration-dependently. AZD1080 exposure also decreased mRNA (C) and protein (D) expression of NF-kB, Cyclin D1
and MMP9 while increased P21 expression when exposed to AZD1080. Results are representative of three separate experiments; data are
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, *P < 0.05.

AZD1080, a novel GSK-3β inhibitor, has been
reported to play a pivotal role in attenuating the downstream
detrimental effects of signaling pathways activated by
multiple stimuli relevant to Alzheimer’s disease [34]. Their
results indicate for the first time that AZD1080 has the ability
to inhibit the GSK-3β enzyme in humans at 1–10  μmol/
kg, and could produce a dose-dependent reduction through
acute oral treatment. Taken our previous studies in sight,
we suggest that AZD1080 may have potential in inhibiting
endometrial carcinoma progression. Our studies showed
significant reduction of endometrial cancer cell viability
from 0.5 μM when exposed to AZD1080. Besides, AZD1080
induced cell apoptosis, suppressed cell migration, and
invasion ability, which was concentration-dependently.
Besides, AZD1080 exposure decreased NF-kB, Cyclin D1
and MMP9 expression while increased P21 expression, thus
we guess that AZD1080 may be an effective drug for treating
endometrial carcinoma. As it as a new, potential anti-cancer
drug, further in vitro tests and clinical studies are needed
before it can be used to treat endometrial carcinoma clinically.
The present study is the first to indicate the oncogenic
role of GSK-3β. GSK-3β may be a novel therapeutic
target for treatment of EC. The inhibition of GSK-3β
expression by miR-129 may prove to be an effective
therapeutic strategy for EC. GSK-3β inhibitor AZD1080
inhibit endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation, migration
and invasion and may be an effective drug for treating
endometrial carcinoma.

MTT assay
The cells were seeded at a density of 3,000 cells/well
in 96-well plates. At a given time point (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and
72 h) after transient transfection, MTT solution (5 mg/ml;
Solarbio, Beijing, China) was added to the cells and
further incubated for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed,
150 μL/well of DMSO was added, and the absorbance was
measured at 490 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer
(Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was quantified using PI staining and
flow cytometry with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)labeled annexin V (BD Pharmingen, USA) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were collected 48 h after
transfection, washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended at
1 × 106 cells/mL, and mixed with 100 μL of 1 × buffer,
5 μL annexin V-FITC, and 5 μL PI and incubated for 15 min
in the dark; 400 μL 1 × buffer was added to the cells, and
the cells were subjected to cytometry flow within 1 h.

Wound-healing assay
Cells were cultured to 85% confluence before
scratched with a 200 μl pipette tip. After scratching, cells
were washed with PBS three times and cultured in FBSfree medium. Wounds were observed by a microscope
and photographed at 0, 24, and 48 h. The nude areas were
measured using the Image J software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), and the percentage of wound
closure was calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Endometrial carcinoma specimens
154 endometrial adenocarcinomas and 28 normal
endometrial specimens were obtained during surgery at the
Department of Gynecology of the First Affiliated Hospital
of China Medical University (Shenyang, Liaoning, China).
The tumor specimens were independently confirmed by
two pathologists. None of the patients had preoperative
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Informed consent was
obtained from each patient; all specimens were handled and
made anonymous according to ethical and legal standards.

Invasion assay
Matrigel-coated transwell filters (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA, USA) were used for the invasion assay.
Matrigel was used at a dilution of 1:10. Cells (5 × 104/L)
suspended in serum-free medium were layered in the upper
compartment of the transwell inserts. The bottom chambers
contained medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, which
served as the chemoattractant. After incubation for 48 h
at 37°C, invaded cells at the bottom of the upper chamber
were stained with crystal violet and counted under an
Olympus fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan).

Cell culture and transfection
The HEC-1B cells were cultured in Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA). Ishikawa
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone,
Logan, UT, USA). The medium was supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin,
and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cultures were incubated
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All
transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MiR-129- 5p

were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The firefly
luciferase activity of the cells that were transfected with
miR-129 mimics was compared with cells transfected with
negative control mimics. For each transfection, the luciferase
activity was averaged from three replicate experiments.

Western blotting
Cells were harvested and lysed using ice-cold RIPA
lysis buffer. All denatured protein samples were separated
by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto Hybond membranes (Amersham,
Munich, Germany). Following blocking for 2 h in 5% fat-free
milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies
against GSK-3β, NF-kB, Cyclin D1, MMP9, and P21 (1:500,
Proteintech, Proteintech Group, USA). Blots were washed with
TBST and then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:5000).
Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) system according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-GAPDH
(1:2000) was set as the internal control.

Statistical analyzes
Statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS
17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Pearson correlation test
was used to analyze the rank data and Mann–Whitney
U test to differentiate the means of different groups. Kaplan–
Meier survival plots were generated and comparisons were
constructed with log-rank statistics. All data were shown as
the mean ± standard deviation from at least three separate
experiments. The differences among groups were analyzed
using a double-sided Student’s t-test, and P < 0.05 was
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Immunohistochemistry

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared
for analysis of GSK-3β expression. The samples were
deparaffinized and rehydrated, then incubated for 20 min
in 3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
Next, the sections were heated to retrieve the antigen and
incubated with 10% goat serum to block non-specific
binding. The samples were probed with an anti-GSK-3β
primary antibody (1:50), and then an appropriate secondary
antibody. After each treatment, the slides were washed three
times with TBST for 5 min. The binding was visualized
with 3, 39-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB).

Foundation of China (Nos. 81202049; 81472440;

Authors’ contributions

In vivo nude mouse xenograft assay

SC, YZ conceived the study, wrote the manuscript
and analyzed interpretation. SC, ZH Z, BL L and KX S
carried out the experiments and analyzed the data. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

BALB/c nude mice at 4 to 6 weeks of age were
obtained from Vital River Laboratories (VRL; Beijing,
China). The animal study was reviewed and approved by
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals with the approval of the China Medical
University Animal Care and Use Committee. As previously
reported [35], a total of 1 × 107 HEC-1B cells transfected
with mutant or wild-type HSA-129 were resuspended in
FBS-free culture medium and injected subcutaneously
into the right flanks of the nude mice. Eight weeks after
injection, the mice were sacrificed. The tumor volume
was measured routinely using direct measurement and
calculated using the formula (length × width2)/2.
