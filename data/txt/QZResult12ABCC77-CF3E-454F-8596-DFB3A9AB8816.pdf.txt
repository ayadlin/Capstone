The promise of dual targeting Akt/mTOR signaling in lethal
prostate cancer
Nicolas Floc’h and Cory Abate-Shen
According to the American Cancer Society
approximately 242,000 new cases of prostate cancer will
be reported in 2012, making it one of the most frequently
diagnosed cancers in men. Moreover, with 1 in 9 men
diagnosed with prostate cancer anticipated to die of the
disease, prostate cancer is also the second-leading cause
of cancer death in men. Although several new treatment
options for men with advanced prostate cancer have
recently become available, none are as yet curative.
Because of the necessity of androgen receptor
signaling for all aspects of normal prostate growth, as
well as for prostate tumorigenesis, androgen deprivation
therapy (i.e., pharmacological depletion of androgens) has
long been a mainstay for treatment of men with advanced
prostate cancer. However, while androgen deprivation
initially leads to tumor regression, ultimately it leads to
a highly aggressive form of the disease, which has been
called “castration-resistant prostate cancer” (CRPC) to
indicate its continued dependence on androgen receptor
signaling despite the absence of androgens [1].
The standard of care for CRPC is chemotherapy,
which provides a modest improvement in survival but
is not curative [2, 3]. In the past few years, several new
treatment options for CRPC have received FDA approval,
including an immunotherapy agent, namely sipuleucel-T
(PROVENGE®), and two agents that inhibit androgen
receptor signaling or activity, namely Abiraterone Acetate
(ZytigaTM) and enzalutamide (XTANDI®) [4-6].
Although each of these has a significant survival benefit,
none are curative for CRPC. Therefore­­an important
challenge is to identify new therapeutic approaches that
are curative for CRPC.
As an alternative to inhibiting androgen receptor
signaling, agents that target critical survival and
proliferative pathways that are deregulated in prostate
cancer are also being investigated. Among the molecular
pathways that are critical for prostate tumorigenesis, loss
of function of the PTEN tumor suppressor through its
deletion, mutation, or deregulated expression occurs at
high frequency [7], leading to aberrant activation of the
Akt kinase as well as it downstream effector, the mTOR
complex (Figure 1). Notably, the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway is frequently deregulated in advanced prostate
cancer and has been implicated in potentiating androgen
receptor signaling; however, targeting this pathway with
single agents has proven not to be effective in prostate
cancer, as well as is the case for many other cancers [8].

Consequently, in our recent study we asked whether
combined inhibition of upstream and downstream nodes
in the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is effective for
suppressing CRPC [9]. We used both in vivo studies of a
genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model of CRPC and
in vitro studies using human prostate cancer cell lines to
investigate the consequences of dual targeting Akt/mTOR
signaling, with an inhibitor of Akt, namely, MK-2206, and
one that targets mTORC1, namely ridaforolimus (MK8669) (Figure 1). We found that dual inhibition of Akt and
mTORC1 had very promising therapeutic outcomes both
in the preclinical studies in vivo in the GEM models and in
the human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro.
Why would dual targeting of two kinases in the same
pathway yield improved results compared with targeting
the pathways individually? In part, this reflects the fact
that inhibition of mTORC1 alone has limited efficacy,
in part due to feedback activation of PI3K/Akt signaling
(Figure 1), particularly in human prostate cancer cells [9].
On the other hand, inhibition of Akt alone was inefficient
for inhibition of mTOR, likely due to MAPK signalingdependent activation of mTOR (Figure 1). Consequently,
by combining two distinct inhibitors (“vertical inhibition”)
we observed an effective neutralization of the Akt/
mTOR pathway, which was associated with reduced cell
proliferation and inhibition of CRPC tumor growth.
How might these findings be applied in the clinic?
Currently, several studies have described a crosstalk
between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and AR signaling pathways.
In particular, it has been suggested that castration-resistant
tumors compensate for reduced AR signaling by activation
of Akt/mTOR signaling, which highlights the therapeutic
potential of combining inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathways
with androgen receptor pathway inhibition. Indeed, Carver
et al have suggested that inhibition of the PI3K pathway
restores AR signaling in PTEN-deficient prostate cells, and
that feedback regulation between AR and PI3K pathways
may be reciprocal [10].
Thus, based on recent findings by us and others, we
propose that a therapeutic approach using dual inhibitors
of Akt/mTOR signaling in combination with inhibitors
of androgen receptor signaling, such as Abiraterone
Acetate or Enzalutamide, may effectively block androgen
signaling while simultaneously inhibiting a Akt/mTOR
signaling and therefore an effective treatment course for
CRPC. We await the results of the relevant clinical trials.

Figure 1: Cross talk between Akt/mTOR and MEK signaling pathways. Loss of function of PTEN leads to activation of the

mTOR pathway mainly via the PI3K/Akt pathway and secondarily via the MEK pathway. Inhibition of mTOR using MK-8669 leads to
a feedback loop activation of Akt (1) Our findings suggest that inhibition of Akt using MK-2206 is not effective for inhibition of mTOR
because of MEK pathway activation (2). Dual inhibition of both with MK-8669 and MK-2206 leads to effective inhibition of Akt/mTOR
signaling.
