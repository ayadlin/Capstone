BACKGROUND: The most frequent nonhematologic side effects associated with dasatinib therapy in
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are gastrointestinal, rash, and fluid retention syndromes.
However, bleeding has been observed in some patients receiving dasatinib. In the current study, the
authors investigated the risk factors and management of bleeding associated with dasatinib therapy for
CML after imatinib failure. METHODS: The bleeding episodes associated with dasatinib therapy in 138
patients with CML who were consecutively treated at the study institution in clinical trials were evaluated.
RESULTS: Bleeding occurred in 32 (23%) patients (grade 3 in 9 [7%] patients [according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria]), including in 12% of patients treated in chronic phase, 31% of
patients treated in accelerated phase (AP), and 35% of patients treated in blast phase (BP) (P ¼ .02). The
majority of episodes (81%) affected the gastrointestinal tract. Basic coagulation studies were normal in 97%
of patients who developed bleeding complications. Although 37% of episodes occurred with platelet
counts >100  109/L, multivariate analysis identified thrombocytopenia and advanced phase CML as risk
factors for bleeding. A trend toward an increased risk with a twice-daily schedule was observed (P ¼ .17).
Management included dasatinib interruption for a median of 17 days (range, 3-51 days) in 47%, of patients
and transfusions in 72% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding occurs during dasatinib therapy, particularly
in patients with AP or BP disease and low platelet counts. Appropriate clinical monitoring and the timely
interruption of dasatinib therapy are warranted in this subset of patients. Cancer 2009;115:2482–90.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate is the standard therapy for BCR-ABL1-positive
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), inducing complete cytogenetic responses (CCyR) in approximately
90% of newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase (CP).1 Imatinib at a dose of 400 mg/day is associated
with mild and manageable toxicities such as superficial edema, nausea, muscle cramps, and skin rash.2
However, drug resistance secondary to BCR-ABL1 kinase point mutations or overamplification of the
BCR-ABL1 genomic locus1,3 may limit long-term efficacy. Activation of SRC family kinases (SFKs) has

been shown to be involved in BCR-ABL1-mediated
leukemogenesis and in some cases of imatinib resistance.4-7 Thus, targeting ABL and SFKs simultaneously
represents a potential means with which to circumvent
resistance induced by BCR-ABL1 mutations and/or
SFKs activation.
Dasatinib is a potent multikinase inhibitor that is
highly active against BCR-ABL1 and SFKs.8 Dasatinib is
reported to be 325-fold more potent than imatinib against
BCR-ABL1 and is active against a wide array of imatinibresistant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutants, the exception being
T315I.9 In phase 2 studies in patients with CML in CP
who had failed imatinib therapy, dasatinib rendered
major cytogenetic and complete hematologic response
(CHR) rates of 62% and 91%, respectively.10 Although
generally well tolerated, dasatinib therapy was not completely devoid of untoward side effects, with the most
commonly observed toxicities being cytopenias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral edema.10-12 The incidence of bleeding complications in dasatinib studies is
reported to range from 8% in patients enrolled in the
phase 1 dose escalation study to 24% among those
patients with myeloid blast phase (BP) disease.11,12
The primary objective of the current study was to
investigate the incidence, severity, management, and outcome of bleeding episodes associated with dasatinib therapy. To this end, we evaluated 138 patients with CML
who had failed imatinib therapy who received treatment
at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) in phase 1 and 2 studies of dasatinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Patients received dasatinib in 1 phase 1 (n ¼ 50 patients)
and 4 phase 2 (n ¼ 88 patients) studies sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Patients were required to have Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML after imatinib
failure because of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance or
because of imatinib intolerance. Entry criteria included
aged 18 years and adequate renal and hepatic function
(creatinine, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels of less than twice the upper
limit of normal). Patients were excluded from the study if
Cancer

their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
score was 3, or if they were in New York Heart Association functional class III through IV. Imatinib was required
to be withdrawn at least 28 days before the initiation of
dasatinib therapy in the phase 1 study and 7 days in phase
2 studies. Women of childbearing age were required to
have a negative pregnancy test, and all patients were
required to use barrier contraception during therapy.
Studies were approved by the MDACC Institutional
Review Board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent before study entry.

Study Design and Dose Modifications
The phase 1 dose escalation study used a classic ‘‘3 þ 3
design’’ and used 7 dose levels ranging from 15 mg/day to
180 mg/day, administered as a single or as a divided
dose.11 Dasatinib was given according to 1 of the following schedules: 5 days on/2 days off, 6 days on/1 day off, or
continuously. Only patients with advanced phase (accelerated phase [AP] or blast phase [BP]) CML or patients in
CP with no steady improvement in their response parameters received dasatinib on a continuous schedule. In
phase 2 and 3 studies, dasatinib was administered on 4
different schedules: 50 mg twice daily, 70 mg twice daily,
100 mg/day, and 140 mg/day in a continuous manner.
Dasatinib dose escalation was allowed in patients who
failed to achieve a CHR after 1 month or a CCyR after
3 months of therapy, or whenever loss of response was
documented.

Evaluation of Patients
Complete blood counts, serum chemistry, and targeted
physical examination for the evaluation of adverse events
were performed weekly during the first 12 weeks, every
other week for the next 3 months, and every 6 weeks
thereafter. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT), and serum fibrinogen levels
were obtained in all patients before the initiation of dasatinib treatment. Institutional normal limits for coagulation
tests were as follows: PT, 10.6 to 13.3 seconds; aPTT,
22.6 to 35.7 seconds; and fibrinogen, 244 to 559 mg/dL.
Coagulation studies were closely monitored in the event
of bleeding. For the purposes of treatment interruptions

and patient management, episodes of bleeding were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) (version 3.0) as follows: grade 1: mild, intervention (other than iron
supplements) not indicated; grade 2: symptomatic and
medical intervention or cauterization indicated; grade 3:
transfusion, interventional radiology, endoscopic, or surgical intervention indicated; grade 4: life-threatening,
major urgent intervention indicated; and grade 5: death.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to present the distribution
of the measured parameters. A P value <.05 was used as
the criterion for statistical significance. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed to identify potential
prognostic factors associated with the development of
pleural effusion. The Fisher exact or chi-square tests for
categoric variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables were used to identify prognostic factors,
which were subsequently included as variables in a multivariate regression model for the development of bleeding.
Multivariate analysis used a logistic regression model.

RESULTS
Study Group and Dasatinib Therapy
From November 2003 through January 2006, 138
patients (69 males and 69 females) with Ph-positive CML
in all phases were treated with dasatinib after imatinib failure or intolerance. The median age of the patients was 57
years (range, 15-81 years). Among 50 patients who were
treated in the phase 1 study, 23 (46%) were in CP, 7
(14%) were in AP, and 20 (40%) were in BP at the time
of the initiation of dasatinib treatment, whereas 88
patients (43 of whom [49%] were in CP, 25 of whom
[28%] were in AP, and 20 of whom [23%] were in BP)
received dasatinib in phase 2 studies. Fifteen (11%)
patients initiated treatment with dasatinib at a dose <100
mg, 22 (16%) did so at 100 mg, 92 (67%) did so at 140
mg, and 9 (6%) did so at a dose >140mg daily. The median time on dasatinib therapy for the study group was 42
weeks (range, 4-120 weeks): 69 weeks (range, 18-120
weeks) for patients in the phase 1 study and 34 weeks
(range, 4-61 weeks) for patients in the phase 2 studies.

Bleeding Associated With Dasatinib
Therapy: Incidence and Outcome
The clinical and demographic characteristics of the
patients who developed bleeding episodes while receiving
dasatinib therapy are summarized in Table 1. Analysis of
the frequency of bleeding associated with dasatinib therapy was based on all 138 patients. Bleeding was demonstrated in 32 (23%) patients: 11 (22%) who were treated
in the phase 1 study and 21 (24%) who were treated in
the phase 2 studies. Seven (5%) patients had grade 1, 16
(11.5%) patients had grade 2, and 9 (6.5%) patients had
grade 3 bleeding. No grade 4 to 5 bleeding episodes were
observed. The median time to the development of bleeding was 6 weeks (range, 0.5-38 weeks), and this occurred
within the first 3 months of therapy in 22 (69%) patients.
A total of 37 bleeding episodes were observed: lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) in 22 patients, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in 8 patients, gingival bleeding
in 4 patients, vaginal bleeding in 2 patients, and epistaxis
in 1 patient. Six (19%) patients experienced different
types of bleeding concomitantly: 4 patients with LGIB
and UGIB; 1 patient with LGIB, gingival bleeding, and
scalp hematoma; and 1 patient with gingival and vaginal
bleeding. In addition, 12 (37.5%) patients (5 in CP, 2 in
AP, and 5 in BP) had recurrent bleeding episodes: 8 cases
of LGIB (in 2 separate occasions in 3 of these patients), 1
case of UGIB, 2 cases of gingival bleeding, and 1 case of
vaginal bleeding. One additional patient in BP, who experienced LGIB, developed gingival bleeding at a later date.
Among patients who developed bleeding while on study,
dasatinib therapy was terminated in 7 (22%) patients
because of LGIB (in 3 patients, recurrent in 2 patients), a
combination of LGIB and UGIB (in 3 patients), or disease progression (in 1 patient). Five (71%) of these 7
patients died because of disease progression. Overall, 15
(47%) of the 32 patients with bleeding complications
reported in the current study died because of disease
progression.

Correlation With CML Phase, Dasatinib
Dose, and Hemostatic Status
Because patients in different CML phases were treated
with different doses of dasatinib, we investigated the
impact of these 2 variables on the development of

bleeding associated with dasatinib therapy (Table 2).
Eight of 66 (12%) patients treated in CP developed bleeding (5 with LGIB, 1 with UGIB, 1 with gingival bleeding,
and 1 with vaginal bleeding). In contrast, 10 of 32 (31%)
patients in AP (6 with LGIB, 1 with UGIB, 1 with epistaxis, 1 with vaginal bleeding, and 1 with gingival bleeding) and 14 of 40 (35%) in BP (11 with LGIB, 2 with
UGIB, and 1 with gingival bleeding) developed this complication (P ¼ .02). Because the initial dasatinib dose
could be modified according to response and/or toxicity,
we analyzed whether the dasatinib dose and dosing schedule at the onset of the first bleeding episode influenced the
incidence of this complication. Of the 37 initial episodes
of bleeding reported, 5 (14%) occurred at dasatinib doses
>140 mg/day, 26 (70%) occurred at a dose of 140 mg/
day (all but 5 at a dose of 70 mg twice daily), 3 (8%)
occurred at a dose of 100 mg/day, and 3 (8%) occurred at
doses <100 mg/day. Thus, 31 (84%) bleeding episodes
occurred in patients receiving 140 mg/day, whereas
only 6 (16%) occurred at dasatinib doses 100 mg/day

(P ¼ .001). The time to the development of the first episode of bleeding did not appear to differ significantly
among different dasatinib dosing schedules (P ¼ .82).
Because advanced phase CML is frequently associated with abnormal platelet counts, we examined the relation between the development of bleeding during
dasatinib therapy and platelet count in the study cohort
(Table 3). Eighteen (49%) of the 37 episodes of bleeding
occurred in patients with a platelet count 30  109/L (5
of them at a platelet count <10  109/L), 5 (14%) in
patients with a platelet count of 31 to 100  109/L, and
14 (37%) in patients with a platelet count >100  109/L.
The majority of episodes of bleeding in patients with a
platelet count >100  109/L were grade 1 (3 patients) or
grade 2 (9 patients), being grade 3 only in 2 instances.
Coagulation studies were available at the onset of bleeding
in 24 (75%) of the 32 patients. The median PT was 12.8
seconds (range, 10.3-21 seconds), the median aPTT was
28.8 seconds (range, 20.7-42 seconds), and the serum
fibrinogen level was 540 mg/dL (range, 118-732 mg/dL).
Only 1 patient with CML in BP and grade 3 LGIB presented with altered coagulation tests (PT of 21 seconds,
aPTT of 42 seconds, serum fibrinogen of 118 mg/dL, and
a D-dimer concentration of 5000 ng/mL), which is
clinically compatible with sepsis-related disseminated
intravascular coagulation. No patient was receiving anticoagulants at the time of the onset of the first episode of
2486

bleeding, but 2 patients in CP who developed LGIB had
been receiving clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg/day and aspirin at a dose of 81 mg/day for 3 months and 1 month,
respectively, because of coronary events. Recently, lymphocytosis, resulting mainly from the expansion of clonal
large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), has been reported to
be associated with the development of colitis and pleural
effusion in patients receiving dasatinib.13 Although 9
(41%) patients with LGIB had relative lymphocytosis at
the start of the bleeding episodes, only 1 (5%) patient
demonstrated absolute lymphocytosis.
On univariate analysis, variables found to be associated with bleeding risk included hemoglobin level,
thrombocytopenia, peripheral blood and bone marrow
blast percentage, CML duration, and CML phase (Table 4). Prior therapy with interferon-a was found to be
associated with a trend toward an increased risk of
bleeding (P ¼ .08). In a multivariate analysis, thrombocytopenia and CML phase (AP/BP vs CP) were found
to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding with
dasatinib therapy (Table 5). It is interesting to note that
neither dasatinib dose nor a history of gastrointestinal
disorders were identified as variables associated with an
increased probability of bleeding during dasatinib
therapy.

Management of Bleeding Episodes
Bleeding resulted in dasatinib therapy interruption in 15
(47%) patients: 8 with LGIB (2 of them also with concomitant UGIB), 6 with UGIB (2 of them also with concomitant LGIB), 2 with gingival bleeding, and 1 with
vaginal bleeding. Dasatinib interruptions related to hemorrhagic episodes lasted for a median of 17 days (range, 351 days). The dasatinib dose was reduced in 11 (34%)
patients: 6 with LGIB (1 of them also with UGIB), 4 with
UGIB (1 of them also with LGIB), 1 with gingival bleeding, and 1 with vaginal bleeding. Three (9%) patients
with UGIB (2 of them with concomitant LGIB) required
treatment interruptions on >1 occasion because of recurrent bleeding. The median duration of the bleeding episodes was 8 days (range, 2-27 days).
Seventeen (65%) of 26 patients with gastrointestinal
bleeding underwent either upper endoscopy (3 patients),
lower endoscopy (7 patients), or both (7 patients). Upper
endoscopic examination revealed mild distal esophagitis

(2 patients), mild gastritis (3 patients), oozing from multiple sites at the duodenal bulb (1 patient), duodenal ulcer
(1 patient), bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation
at the greater gastric curvature (1 patient), or a normal examination (2 patients). Colonoscopies demonstrated
severe colitis (2 patients), erythematous colon (2 patients),
rectal ulcer (2 patients), a Dieulafoy lesion at the transverse colon (1 patient), or a normal examination (7
patients). Biopsies were obtained in 6 patients undergoing
colonoscopy, revealing chronic inflammatory changes of
varying severity characterized by cryptitis and apoptosis of
the intestinal epithelium. The colon biopsy of a patient
who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation 4
months before bleeding revealed features consistent with
graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, dasatinib was most
likely the cause of bleeding in this patient because rechallenge with dasatinib immediately resulted in another
LGIB episode.
Overall, 23 (72%) patients required transfusion of
packed red blood cells (PRBC) or platelets; 17 patients
received both and 6 received either PRBCs (3 patients) or
platelets (3 patients). The median number of units of
PRBCs and platelets transfused during the first week after
the onset of bleeding was 4 (range, 2-11 units) and 16
(range, 2-49 units) units, respectively. Three patients with
UGIB (2 of them also with LGIB) required admission to
the intensive care unit for fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic monitoring, and endoscopic cauterization of bleeding lesions. These 3 patients were receiving dasatinib at a
dose of 70 mg twice daily (2 patients) or 140 mg/day (1
patient) and had platelet counts of 216  109/L, 14 
109/L, and 101  109/L, respectively. Proton pump
2488

inhibitors were administered intravenously to 14 (44%)
patients.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we reported that dasatinib therapy
was associated with bleeding episodes in 23% of patients
with CML who were treated in clinical trials at the study
institution. This complication was more frequent among
those patients with advanced (AP or BP) disease who were
receiving dasatinib at a dose 140 mg daily and affected
the gastrointestinal tract in 81% of cases. There was a recurrence of bleeding in 37% of patients and led to the termination of dasatinib therapy in 22%. Although the
majority of bleeding episodes were mild or moderate, 3
patients did require more aggressive management.
Despite this potential complication, dasatinib therapy is usually well tolerated. In the phase 1 study, the
major adverse effect related to dasatinib was reversible
cytopenia.11 In the phase 2 studies, the most frequent
nonhematologic side effects were diarrhea (37%) and rash
(35%) among patients treated in CP,10 and diarrhea
(36%) and pleural effusion (28%) among those treated in
myeloid BP.12 In the above-mentioned phase 1 study, 7
(8%) of 84 patients developed gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which was classified as grade 3 to 4 in 5 patients
(6%).11 Among patients with myeloid BP, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 9 (12%) of 74 patients (grade
3-4 in 8%).12 However, none of these studies addressed
the risk factors associated with bleeding complications
during dasatinib therapy. In the current study, we
observed that 49% of the bleeding episodes occurred in

patients with platelet counts 30  109/L. However,
37% of such episodes occurred in patients with platelet
counts >100  109/L. In addition, all but 1 (97%) of the
patients who developed bleeding and for whom coagulation studies were available had PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen
levels within normal limits. Using multivariate analysis,
thrombocytopenia and advanced phase CML were found
to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding during
dasatinib therapy. Neither dasatinib dose nor an antecedent gastrointestinal disorder were identified as risks factors
for bleeding diathesis (P ¼ .45). A trend toward an
increased risk was observed with twice-daily versus oncedaily administration (P ¼ .17) on univariate analysis,
which suggests that patients with AP or BP disease receiving dasatinib twice daily, particularly at daily doses >140
mg, should be monitored for bleeding complications. In
contrast to twice-daily schedules (especially those using
140 mg/day), a dose of 100 mg once daily has been
shown to greatly reduce the incidence of adverse events in
CP CML, including bleeding.14 In keeping with these figures, only 8% of patients in the current study who were
treated with 100 mg once daily developed bleeding, a rate
that is similar to that of patients treated at a dose of <100
mg/day.
The pathophysiology of bleeding associated with
dasatinib therapy remains poorly understood. In vitro,
dasatinib inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation
in human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat platelet-rich
plasma at concentrations of 0.5 to 5 lg/mL. A concentration of 5 lg/mL (which is 5-fold higher than the peak
concentration [Cmax] in humans) induced 94% inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation of human platelets.15 The effect of dasatinib on human whole blood clot
formation was limited to a 29% reduction in clot strength
at a concentration of 5 lg/mL. In vivo, dasatinib at mean
plasma concentrations 144 ng/mL prolonged cuticle
bleeding time in rats.16 It has been shown that dasatinib,
while not interfering with secondary hemostasis, may disturb platelet aggregation through an as-yet unknown
mechanism.17 It is important to note that other TKIs such
as imatinib, nilotinib, or the dual ABL1/SFK inhibitor
bosutinib have not been associated with platelet aggregation defects.17 Accordingly, all but 1 patient in the current
study developed mucocutaneous bleeding with normal
coagulation studies, strongly suggesting a primary hemostasis defect.

Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) kinase may in part contribute to the development of bleeding associated with dasatinib.8 The concentration that inhibits 50% (IC50) for PDGFR-b inhibition
in cell-based assays ranges between 3 nanomolar (nM)
and 28 nM.8,18 Dasatinib inhibits PDGF-stimulated
migration and proliferation of human vascular smooth
muscle cells.18 PDGFR-b is involved in angiogenesis regulation,19 and PDGFR-b-deficient mouse embryos are
reported to exhibit severe pericyte deficiency in capillaries
as well as smooth muscle hypoplasia, leading to microaneurysms and hemorrhage.20,21
The majority of bleeding episodes were circumscribed to the gastrointestinal tract, consisting of LGIB,
UGIB, or both in 81% of patients. This anatomic
predilection may be correlated with the oral administration of dasatinib. When a single 14C-dasatinib dose was
administered to Long-Evans rats, the largest percentage
of the radioactive dasatinib dose was detected in the
gastrointestinal tract and liver,15 which is consistent
with the oral administration of dasatinib and a major
route of elimination in the feces.22 An exploratory
repeat-dose study in dogs was discontinued after 2 days
of the administration of dasatinib at a dose of 5 mg/kg
because of bloody emesis and feces within 2 hours after
dosing.15 This gastrointestinal toxicity observed in animal models occurred at clinically relevant area-underthe-curve dasatinib levels. In cynomolgus monkeys that
were euthanized after the development of dasatinibinduced gastrointestinal toxicity, intestinal villous
blunting and nonspecific inflammatory signs were
observed,16 closely resembling the findings observed on
endoscopic examination of patients with LGIB in the
current study. Lymphocytosis secondary to marked
expansion of clonal LGLs has been recently described
in patients receiving dasatinib.13 Dasatinib-induced
complications (eg, colitis and pleural effusion) developed in a significant proportion of patients found to
have LGL expansion.13 In the current study, 41% of
patients with LGIB had relative lymphocytosis, but
only 5% had absolute lymphocytosis. The issue of
whether clonal LGL expansion plays a significant pathogenetic role in dasatinib-induced bleeding will require
prospective and systematic analysis of tissue samples
obtained from dasatinib-treated patients who develop
that complication.

In summary, bleeding complications occur during
dasatinib therapy but are usually mild and manageable.
Bleeding typically involves the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in patients with advanced phase CML and low
platelet counts. Appropriate monitoring and early recognition of the signs of bleeding are warranted to prevent
unwanted outcomes.
