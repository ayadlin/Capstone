BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant but poorly understood complication in patients
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). As a result, most patients receive thromboprophylaxis with low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors for VTE in
NDMM and evaluate the effectiveness of LMWH. METHODS: A total of 604 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma
completed 3 induction cycles with multiagent chemotherapy with up-front randomization to thalidomide between
1998 and 2004. Prophylactic enoxaparin was given to thalidomide recipients beginning in June 2001, and 122 subjects
received prophylactic epoetin alfa (EPO) as part of an exercise trial. The primary study endpoint was grades 3-4 VTE.
RESULTS: A total of 72 patients (11.9%) developed VTE (mostly deep venous thrombosis), with a higher incidence
among EPO recipients (P ¼ .001), although only significant for upper extremity DVT (P ¼ .0002). The EPO-treated
patients had higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels throughout the study (P < .0005), although no relationship between
higher Hb levels and increasing incidence of VTE could be shown. A history of VTE was a strong predictor of VTE on
univariate analysis (P < .000005). Enoxaparin did not reduce the rate of VTE (P ¼ .158). Logistic regression analysis
identified thalidomide therapy (P ¼ .001; odds ratio [OR], 2.428; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.418-4.159) and
prophylactic EPO (P ¼ .002; OR, 2.488; 95% CI, 1.432-4.324) as risk factors for VTE. Myeloma response and survival
were not negatively affected by prophylactic EPO or VTE. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic EPO, thalidomide therapy,
and VTE history, but not higher Hb levels, were found to increase the risk of VTE among NDMM patients receiving
multiagent chemotherapy. This risk was not found to be reduced in this population by LMWH thromboprophylaxis.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication among patients with newly diagnosed multiple

myeloma, particularly during induction therapy,1,2 and has been associated with the use of immunomodulatory agents
(eg, thalidomide) in combination with glucocorticoids and/or with chemotherapy particularly doxorubicin.1-3 The
mechanism(s) by which thalidomide predisposes to VTE and the specific risk factors that predispose patients to this
complication remain to be determined.
Erythropoeisis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as epoetin alfa/recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels and reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions in diverse groups of patients with cancer-related

Figure 1. The Total Therapy II (TT2) myeloma treatment protocol is shown. This venous thromboembolism (VTE) study included
the first 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Patients were randomized at the start of TT2 to thalidomide (400 mg/d orally) or
no thalidomide for the entire duration of TT2 therapy. VAD ¼ vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (0.5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2,
and 40 mg respectively); DCEP ¼ dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (40 mg, 400 mg/m2, 40 mg/m2,
and 15 mg/m2, respectively). CADn ¼ cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (750 mg/m2, 15 mg/m2, and 40 mg,
respectively) for stem cell mobilization. Patients were then given high-dose melphalan (140-200 mg/m2). PBSCT, peripheral

anemia.4 Over half of patients with multiple myeloma are
anemic (Hb < 12 g/dL) at diagnosis,5 and nearly all
become anemic during treatment, often requiring red
blood cell transfusions.6 In patients with multiple myeloma, EPO has been shown to reduce red blood cell
transfusion requirements and increase Hb during chemotherapy.7 However, recent reports suggest that ESAs
increase the risk of VTE in cancer patients receiving
chemotherapy8 by a yet unknown mechanism.
The rate of VTE in patients with multiple myeloma
receiving thalidomide-containing regimens has been
reported to be decreased by thromboprophylaxis with
low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin,
and aspirin as recently reviewed.9-12 These preliminary
results prompted recommendations for prophylactic anticoagulation for patients receiving thalidomide- and lenalidomide-based combination regimens by the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO),13 the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),14 the Italian
Association of Medical Oncology (IAMO),15 and the
European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO).16 However, these recommendations are not based on randomized trials. Furthermore, many of the cited studies were
either small series and/or lacked a control group, and their
results have been inconsistent, suggesting that only subgroups of patients with myeloma may have rates of VTE
high enough to warrant the costs and potential complications of thromboprophylaxis.
The specific objectives of this study were to
identify the subgroup of patients with newly diagnosed
myeloma undergoing remission induction chemotherapy who were at highest risk for VTE, particularly in
relation to treatment with thalidomide and/or EPO,
and to ascertain whether thromboprophylaxis with
LMWH reduced the rate of VTE among thalidomidetreated patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (either
untreated or treated with only 1 cycle of standard chemotherapy) were randomly assigned between October 1998
and February 2004 to receive identical cytotoxic treatment with up-front randomization to thalidomide at a
starting dose of 400 mg/d or no thalidomide. The protocol was a phase 3 open-label prospective trial (Total Therapy II [TT2]) and consisted of induction treatment with
combination chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem
cell (PBSC) collection after the third cycle, followed by 2
cycles of high-dose melphalan therapy and autologous
PBSC rescue (Figure 1).1
The current study is a retrospective evaluation of the
cohort of 604 consecutive TT2 patients who completed
the first 3 cycles of remission induction (Figure 1).
Because of an increased risk of VTE among thalidomidetreated patients, patients randomized to thalidomide were
given prophylactic subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg/d beginning June 1, 2001.1
Enoxaparin was started the first day of induction
therapy and continued for the entire duration of the
induction phase but was held if platelet counts dropped
below 30  109/L or if active bleeding developed.
Patients enrolled in TT2 were also offered to participate
in a trial in which participants were randomized to exercise versus usual care. All 122 participants in the latter
trial were also given prophylactic EPO for the duration
of the study period (Figure 2).5 Because of the significant
clinical burden of anemia (both disease- and treatmentrelated), the EPO regimen allowed Hb levels to reach
15 g/dL before dose reduction. The no-EPO control
group (n ¼ 482) consisted of patients who did not
receive prophylactic EPO according to this algorithm
but who may have received the drug per standards of
care, typically treating patients with anemia to a target

A review of patient medical records, including all
reports of VDUs, was performed to ascertain the presence
of DVT/PE and to collect other variables of interest. Baseline variables examined were age, body mass index, race,
sex, myeloma subtype, history of VTE, allocation to thalidomide or no thalidomide, receipt of enoxaparin with
thalidomide, receipt of EPO, diagnosis of amyloidosis,
platelet count (>350,000/lL), prothrombin time (PT),
and serum levels of beta-2-microglobulin, albumin, creatinine, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein.
Serum Hb levels were evaluated at baseline and throughout the study period, and myeloma response was assessed
as described previously.1 The follow-up period ended on

January 9, 2008. All patients were cared for at the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, the University
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.
The institutional review board approved the study.
Univariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of VTE with emphasis on specific risk groups,
including receipt of prophylactic EPO and/or thalidomide
and thromboprophylaxis with LMWH. To explore the
association between VTE and potential risk factors (EPO,
thalidomide, and others), an independent t test and a chisquare test were used for continuous and dichotomous
variables, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used
to scrutinize the contributions of EPO, thalidomide,
LMWH, and other potential confounding factors to VTE
development and included all variables that were significant on univariate analysis at the alpha level of P < .05.
History of VTE was not included in the logistic regression
analysis because the records of VDUs performed before
referral to our institution were not available to us. We
only collected history of VTE data on those patients with
confirmed DVT via VDU. All analyses were conducted
using the NCSS 2007 statistical program.18

RESULTS
A total of 72 out of 604 patients (11.9%) developed VTE
during the first 3 cycles of therapy, with 29%, 45%, and
25% developing VTE after VAD, dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/dexamethasone, respectively. Overall,
EPO-treated patients had a significantly higher incidence
of VTE compared with their no-EPO counterparts
(P ¼ .001), although this difference was only significant
for upper extremity DVT (P ¼ .0002) (Table 1). The
mean time to VTE was 58.2 days for the EPO group
(95% confidence interval [CI], 46.2-70.1) and 56.9 days
for the no-EPO groups (95% CI, 48.1-65.8); P ¼ .86.
Most VTEs were grade 3 (84% and 97.7% in the
EPO and no-EPO groups, respectively); 10 patients (4 in
the EPO group) developed grade 4 DVTs (all lower
extremities and associated with nonfatal PE). A total of 19
(26%) patients had multiple DVTs simultaneously, 1 (4%)
in the EPO group and 18 (38%) in the no-EPO group.
History of VTE and thromboprophylaxis were not significantly associated with the development of multiple DVTs
(P ¼ .64 and P ¼ .25, respectively). Allocation to exercise
or usual care did not predict upper and/or lower extremity
DVT among the 25 EPO-treated patients who developed
this complication (P ¼ .695). Among thalidomide-treated
patients, there was no significant difference in the rate of
DVT between the exercise and usual care groups.
The EPO-treated patients had higher Hb levels
throughout the study (P < .0005), although no relationship between higher Hb levels and increasing incidence of
VTE could be shown (Table 2).
Baseline patient characteristics were similar between
the EPO and the no-EPO groups (Table 3) except that

the former group had higher values for serum albumin (P
< .005), fibrinogen (P ¼ .001) and PT (P ¼ .002). A history of VTE was present among 32% and 31.9% of the
EPO and the no-EPO groups, respectively. Because the
exercise/EPO study started after the recognition of thalidomide-associated VTE (June 1, 2001), all EPO-treated
patients received prophylactic enoxaparin if they were
assigned to thalidomide; as a result, more patients in the
EPO group received enoxaparin (P < .000005). Table 4
compares patients’ baseline characteristics according to
development of VTE. Univariate analysis identified 3
strong predictors of VTE: history of VTE (P < .000005)
and receipt of thalidomide (P ¼ .001) or EPO (P ¼
.001). Other baseline variables associated with higher risk
for VTE were platelet count >350,000/lL (P ¼ .047)
and higher PT (P ¼ .012) and serum C-reactive protein
level (P ¼ .049). Thromboprophylaxis with LMWH did
not decrease the incidence of upper or lower extremity
DVT (P ¼ .158). There were no significant changes in
the rates of DVT before and after the institution of enoxaparin for the group assigned to thalidomide (Table 4).
Logistic regression analyses identified receipt of thalidomide (P ¼ .001; odds ratio [OR], 2.428; 95% CI,
1.418-4.159) and prophylactic EPO (P ¼ .002; OR,
2.488; 95% CI, 1.432-4.324) as predictors of VTE,
whereas a higher baseline PT was protective (P ¼ .002;
OR, 0.927; 95% CI, 0.883-0.973).
The development of VTE did not affect response to
therapy or overall survival, although EPO therapy was

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to identify the risk factors for VTE
among a homogeneous group of 604 newly diagnosed
patients with myeloma undergoing remission induction
treatment with multiagent chemotherapy. Several findings
emerged from this study. (1) receipt of thalidomide and
prophylactic EPO and a history of VTE were risk factors for
VTE; (2) risk of VTE among EPO recipients was not
related to higher Hb values; (3) enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis did not reduce the rate of VTE; and (4) response to
myeloma therapy and overall survival were not negatively
affected by prophylactic EPO or the development of VTE.
Our finding that EPO treatment is a risk factor for
upper extremity VTE among myeloma patients is new,
although the association between VTE and therapy with
ESAs has been reported in studies that included various
malignancies.19,20 The lack of association in our study
between higher Hb values and VTE risk is supported by the
findings of a recent case-control study in which peak Hb
and hematocrit levels in cancer patients treated with EPO or
darbopoietin did not correlate with the incidence of thrombosis.21 The increased risk of upper extremity DVT with
EPO should be confirmed by others. All our patients had
central venous catheters (CVCs), which are known to
increase the risk of DVT in cancer patients with an incidence of 12%-60%.22,23
Our finding of increased risk for VTE among
patients with a history of thromboembolism is in agreement with other reports.24 However, history of VTE was
not included in the logistic regression analysis because we
did not have the records of VDUs performed before
patient referral to our institution.
Patients with VTE are typically treated with LMWH
followed by warfarin. Before arrival at our institution,
patients are instructed to stop warfarin in anticipation of
diagnostic biopsy procedures required for myeloma workup. Our finding that a prolonged baseline PT was a predictor of VTE is likely a reflection of the residual effect of warfarin on PT values in these patients, with PT probably
serving as an indirect marker for a history of VTE.
The association between VTE and thalidomide in
myeloma patients confirms our original findings1,11,25
and those of others.2 In a recent meta-analysis of thalidomide therapy in patients with myeloma, 376 of 3322
(11.3%) patients developed VTE. Receipt of thalidomide
increased the rate of VTE by 2.1-fold (P < .01), a risk

The significant difference between EPO and no-EPO groups with regard to LMWH is due to the fact that the exercise/
EPO study began after the recognition of thalidomide-associated VTE (June 1, 2001); hence, all EPO patients who were
treated with thalidomide received LMWH.

further increased when dexamethasone or other chemotherapeutic agents were combined with thalidomide (3.1fold and 1.5-fold, respectively; P < .01).26
In contrast to the previously reported decreased survival among patients with cancer who develop VTE27 and
in line with our previous findings,28 the development of
VTE did not affect patient survival.
The lack of protective effect of thromboprophylaxis
in our analysis differs from previous reports that thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, warfarin, or aspirin may be
effective (as recently reviewed).9-12 As a result of these
reports, ASCO,13 NCCN,14 IAMO,15 and ESMO16
guidelines now recommend prophylactic anticoagulation
for myeloma patients receiving thalidomide-based regimens. However, these guidelines are not based on
randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). Furthermore, many
of the cited studies were either too small and/or lacked a

554

control group, and their results were inconsistent. The
only RCT of thromboprophylaxis enrolled 703 patients
with myeloma undergoing induction therapy with thalidomide, corticosteroid, bortezomib, and melphalan combinations. The study compared thromboprophylaxis with
enoxaparin, aspirin, or low fixed-dose warfarin in 539
patients with a control group of 164 patients who did not
receive prophylaxis. The risk for VTE was lowest among
controls (1.8%) compared with 3.9%, 4.5%, and 5% for
low-fixed dose of warfarin, enoxaparin, and aspirin,
respectively, suggesting that thromboprophylaxis was not
beneficial.29 Importantly, the risk of VTE in bortezomibcontaining regimens appears to be very low, even in the
absence of thromboprophylaxis,30,31 presumably because
bortezomib inhibits platelet function30,32,33
Our findings that LMWH prophylaxis was not
effective in preventing upper or lower extremity VTEs are

in agreement with our original report on Total Therapy
II1 and with the findings of several RCTs in ambulatory
patients with cancer34-38 and in cancer patients with indwelling CVCs as recently reviewed.39,40
The higher survival among EPO-treated patients is
probably related to better baseline prognostic factors,
including higher serum albumin. The data on the association between EPO and response to cancer therapy and
survival have been mixed. In 1 study, EPO prolonged the
life of several patients with multiple myeloma with a very
short expected survival.41 In an RCT involving 351
patients with head and neck cancers, EPO given before
and continuing throughout radiotherapy impaired disease
control.42 Increased cancer-related mortality with ESAs
given for prophylaxis or therapy of cancer-related anemia
was suggested in a meta-analysis of 13,933 patients from
53 RCTs comparing ESAs plus red blood cell transfusions
versus transfusions alone,43 but this finding was not
observed in another meta-analysis of 56,210 patients.44

Our study is not without the limitations of all retrospective studies, including the nonrandom allocation to
EPO or no-EPO and to LMWH versus no thromboprophylaxis, and there were differences in some baseline characteristics among the EPO groups. In addition, some of the noEPO patients may have received EPO according to standards
of care; similarly, some thalidomide-treated patients may not
have received LMWH because of contraindications or financial constraints, and genetic factors associated with hypercoagulable states were not examined. It is also possible that
LMWH could decrease the rate of VTE in settings in which
lower doses of EPO and thalidomide are used and where chemotherapeutic agents not associated with a high rate of endothelial injury or requiring a CVC are applied. Finally, the
increased rate of VTEs with EPO was limited to the upper
extremities, suggesting that EPO may not be a risk factor for
VTE in this population, except in the presence of a CVC.
Our findings have clinical implications. Because
thromboprophylaxis did not reduce the rate of VTE in our

study of 604 patients, and because of the risks and costs
associated with this treatment modality, society guidelines
recommending thromboprophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma should be revisited in light of these and other
recent findings.13-16 Indeed, thromboprophylaxis did not
appear to be protective in the only RCT of 703 patients
with myeloma,29 in ambulatory patients with cancer,34-38
and in cancer patients with indwelling CVCs.39,40 Additional studies are needed to identify those myeloma patients
at highest risk for VTE and to evaluate the protective effect,
if any, of various classes of agents (LMWH, warfarin, or aspirin). Indeed, the 5.6% incidence of arterial thrombosis
reported among younger patients undergoing therapy for
multiple myeloma suggests that aspirin may perhaps be better suited for patients at risk for arterial thrombosis—
namely younger patients with hypertension, smoking, and
high factor 8 levels—and patients who are undergoing
remission induction therapy.45
Finally, a risk-assessment model for thromboprophylaxis has been proposed in which individual risk factors for thrombosis associated with therapy with
immunomodulatory agents are evaluated.2 These risk factors include age, history of VTE, presence of a CVC,

556

comorbidities (infections, diabetes, and cardiac disease),
immobilization, surgery, inherited thrombophilia, new
diagnosis of myeloma, hyperviscosity, and therapy with
high-dose dexamethasone, doxorubicin, or multiagent
chemotherapy in combination with immunomodulatory
agents. LMWH is recommended for patients with 2 or
more risk factors and those receiving concurrent therapy
with high-dose dexamethasone or doxorubicin. Because
patients with myeloma typically have many of these risk
factors (older age, CVC, comorbidities, immobilization,
and others), the implementation of this model will likely
result in the overtreatment of a large proportion of patients,
far too higher than the actual incidence of VTE in this
patient population, particularly given that this model does
not take into consideration the potential protective effect of
bortezomib when used in such patients.30,31
Until the aforementioned issues have been carefully
studied, we recommend reserving thromboprophylaxis for
patients at highest risk for VTE (eg, newly diagnosed
patients undergoing remission induction therapy with
immunomodulating agents but without bortezomib) and
who also have a history of VTE and/or a personal or family
history of a hypercoagulable state. In addition, the ESAs
should be limited to patients with symptomatic anemia and
in whom other causes for anemia have been ruled out; these
agents should be given at the lowest possible dose and for
the shortest duration to prevent red blood cell transfusions.
We conclude that prophylactic EPO, thalidomide
therapy, and a history of VTE, but not higher Hb values,
are risk factors for VTE among patients with newly diagnosed myeloma undergoing remission induction with multiagent chemotherapy and that thromboprophylaxis with
LMWH does not appear to decrease the risk of VTE in this
setting. Myeloma response and survival were not negatively
affected by prophylactic EPO or the development of VTE.
