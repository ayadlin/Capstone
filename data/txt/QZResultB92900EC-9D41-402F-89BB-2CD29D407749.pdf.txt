Diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with dismal prognosis
despite current therapies; therefore new treatment strategies are urgently required. Numerous
studies have suggested that epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to early14
stage dissemination of cancer cells and is pivotal for invasion and metastasis of PDAC - .
EMT program is associated with phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells into
mesenchymal-like cells in cell culture conditions, albeit such defined mesenchymal
conversion (with spindle shaped morphology) of epithelial cells is rare with quasi56
mesenchymal phenotypes occasionally observed in the tumor (partial EMT) , . Most studies
exploring the functional role of EMT in tumors have depended on cell culture induced lossof-function and gain-of-function experiments involving EMT inducing transcription factors
2 3 7 10
such as Twist, Snail and Zeb1 , , - . Therefore, the functional contribution of EMT
46
program for invasion and metastasis remains unclear , and genetically engineered mouse
models (GEMMs) to specifically address a causal connection are lacking. Here we
functionally probed the role of EMT program in PDAC by generating PDAC GEMMs with
deletion of Snail or Twist, two key transcription factors responsible for EMT. EMT
suppression in the primary tumor did not alter the emergence of invasive PDAC, systemic

dissemination and metastasis. Suppression of EMT led to an increase in cancer cell
proliferation with enhanced expression of nucleoside transporters in tumors, contributing to
enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment and increased overall survival of mice.
Collectively, our study suggests that Snail or Twist induced EMT program is not ratelimiting for invasion and metastasis but highlights the importance of combining EMT
inhibition with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

We crossed Twist1L/L or Snai1L/L mice with Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D; P53R172H/+ (KPC)
to generate the Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D; P53R172H/+; Twist1L/L (KPC; TwistcKO) and the
Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D; P53R172H/+; Snai1L/L (KPC; SnailcKO) mice, respectively. The
resultant progeny were born in an expected Mendelian ratio, without overt phenotypic
findings other than the anticipated emergence of spontaneous pancreatic cancer (Extended
Figure 1A). Genetic deletion of Snai1 or Twist1 did not significantly delay pancreatic
tumorigenesis, alter tumor histopathology features or local invasion (Figure 1A-C and
Extended Table 1). KPC; TwistcKO and KPC; SnailcKO mice displayed similar tumor
burden compared to KPC control mice (Extended Figure 1B), and insignificant difference
in overall survival (Figure 1D). Loss of Twist1 or Snai1 expression in the pancreas
epithelium was confirmed by in situ hybridization coupled with CK8 epithelial
immunolabeling (Figure 1E and Extended Figure 1C) as well as immunolabeling for Twist
and Snail (Extended Figure 1D). Suppression of EMT program was significantly noted
(Figure 1F-G, Extended Figure 1E). Lineage tracing (Figure 1F) and immunolabeling of
the primary tumor (Figure 1G) showed a significant decrease in the frequency of epithelial
cells with expression of the mesenchymal marker αSMA (EMT+ cells) and a decrease in
expression of EMT inducing transcription factor, Zeb1 (Figure 1H). Global gene expression
profiling of tumors revealed a decrease in expression of EMT associated genes (including
Snai1 and Twist1) in KPC; SnailcKO and KPC; TwistcKO mice compared to KPC control
(Extended Figure 1F). Loss of Snail and Twist enhanced E-cadherin expression and
suppressed Zeb2 and Sox4 expression in cancer cells (Extended Figure 2A-C). Snai2
(Slug) expression was restricted to early PanIN lesion in all the experimental groups with no
observed expression in advanced tumors and was significantly reduced in KPC; SnailcKO
and KPC;TwistcKO mice compared to KPC control mice (Extended Figure 2D).

While desmoplasia, including extracellular matrix (ECM) and myofibroblasts content
(Figure 1I and Extended Figure 2E-F), tumor vessel density (Extended Figure 2G),
intratumoral hypoxia (Extended Figure 2H), CD3+ T-cell infiltration (Extended Figure
2I), and cancer cell apoptosis was unaffected with Twist/Snail deletion in KPC tumors
(Figure 2A), the proliferation of cancer cells in mice with suppressed EMT program was
significantly increased (Figure 2B), as shown previously in mouse models of breast
11 13
cancers - . Immunostaining experiments further revealed that EMT+ cancer cells are
largely Ki67− (Extended Figure 3A). Altogether, the data suggests that EMT program
driven by Twist/Snail transcription factors is dispensable for initiation and progression of
primary pancreatic cancer.
Next, we investigated whether suppression of EMT program impacts invasion and
metastasis. The number of YFP+ CTCs from lineage traced KPC and KPC; TwistcKO was
found unchanged (Figure 2C and Extended Figure 3B), and expression of cancer cell

specific KrasG12D mRNA in the blood from KPC, KPC; TwistcKO and KPC; SnailcKO was
unaffected (Figure 2D), suggesting that suppression of EMT program in pancreatic tumors
does not impact the rate of systemic dissemination of cancer cells. Extensive
histopathological analyses, coupled with CK19 or YFP immunostaining of distant metastatic
target organs, namely the liver, lung and spleen, indicated a similar frequency of metastasis
in EMT suppressed tumors when compared to control tumors (Figure 2E, Extended Figure
3C, Extended Table 1, and Extended Table 2). The metastases were negative for Twist and
Snail, and only a few KPC metastatic cells expressed αSMA or Zeb1 (Extended Figure 3DF), while being positive for E-cadherin and Ki-67 (Extended Figure 3G-H). The
proliferation rate of cancer cells in the metastases was similar in KPC, KPC; SnailcKO and
KPC; TwistcKO mice (Extended Figure 3H). Collectively, the results indicated that the
genetic deletion of Twist1 or Snai1 in PDAC GEMMs did not reduce metastatic disease.

To evaluate whether cancer cells from the pancreas with and without EMT program
differentially benefited from impaired proliferation to form secondary tumors, we isolated
cancer cells from KPC, KPC; TwistcKO and KPC; SnailcKO mice to assay their organ
colonization potential. Twist1 was significantly reduced and Snai1 expression was
undetectable in cancer cells isolated from Twist and Snail deleted tumors, respectively
(Figure 2F). Short-term potential to form tumor spheres (associated with putative cancer
stem phenotype) appeared similar in TwistcKO and SnailcKO KPC cells when compared to
3 8 14 16
control KPC cells (Figure 2G) , , - . Lung colonization frequency following the i.v.
injection of KPC cancer cells (Twist or Snail deleted) were similar to the control KPC
cancer cells (Figure 2H). These results suggest that a favored epithelial phenotype of cancer
cells (via suppression of EMT program) did not impact the capacity to form tumor spheres
17
or their ability for organ colonization .

Cancer cell EMT program is associated with gemcitabine drug resistance in PDAC patients
1 2 8 9 18 23
and in the orthotopic mouse models of PDAC , , , , - . Moreover, enhanced frequency of
24 25
EMT+ cancer cells in pancreatic tumors is associated with poor survival , . To determine
whether EMT program suppression enhances PDAC sensitivity to gemcitabine
chemotherapy, we tested the gemcitabine sensitivity of cancer cells with suppressed EMT
program in KPC mice. Equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1 and concentrating
nucleoside transporter CNT3 were significantly upregulated in cancer cells lacking Snail and
Twist, while ENT2 expression was unchanged (Figure 3A-C). KPC, KPC; SnailcKO and
KPC; TwistcKO mice were treated with gemcitabine and tumor burden was monitored by
MRI (Extended Table 3). Tumor progression was suppressed in KPC; SnailcKO and KPC;
TwistcKO mice when compared to treated KPC control mice (Figure 3D). KPC; SnailcKO
and KPC; TwistcKO mice treated with gemcitabine showed improved histopathology and
increased survival (Figure 3E-G).
Cancer cells isolated from the tumors of KPC; SnailcKO and KPC; TwistcKO mice showed
epithelial morphology (Extended Figure 4A) and reduced expression of mesenchymal
genes compared to KPC cancer cell lines (Extended Figure 4B), however, in tissue culture
conditions (2D culture on plastic), equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1/ENT2/
ENT3) showed similar expression pattern and expression of concentrating nucleoside
transporters (CNT1/CNT3) was not detected (Extended Figure 4B). Increased proliferation

of KPC; SnailcKO and KPC; TwistcKO cancer cells compared to KPC control cells
(Extended Figure 4C) likely accounted for the increased sensitivity to gemcitabine and
erlotinib in this setting (Extended Figure 4D).

Next, we crossed the Snai1L/L to the PDAC GEMM, Ptf1a (P48)-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D;
Tgfbr2L/L (KTC) to generate Ptf1a (P48)-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D; Tgfbr2L/L; Snai1L/L (KTC;
SnailcKO). The KTC model offers a reliable and penetrant disease progression rate with a
consistent timeline of death due to PDAC. Similar to the KPC; SnailcKO mice, KTC;
SnailcKO deletion exhibited suppression of EMT program but did not impact primary tumor
histopathology, lifespan, local invasion, desmoplasia and frequency of apoptosis (Figure 4F,
Extended Figure 5A-E, and Extended Figure 6A). KTC; SnailcKO mice presented with
significantly reduced Zeb1 expression in cancer cells but enhanced proliferation and
concentrating nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3) expression (Extended Figure 5E). ENT2
and ENT1 expression were unchanged in KTC; SnailcKO mice compared to KTC mice
(Extended Figure 5E and Extended Figure 6A). KTC; SnailcKO mice demonstrated
enhanced response to gemcitabine therapy, with significant normal parenchymal area and
reduced tumor tissue (Figure 4A-C). Gemcitabine therapy in KTC; SnailcKO reduced tumor
burden (Figure 4D) and significantly improved overall survival (Figure 4E) of mice when
compared to gemcitabine treated control KTC mice. Gemcitabine therapy specifically
increased cancer cell apoptosis and removed enhanced proliferation observed in EMT
program suppressed tumors (Figure 4G and Extended Figure 5E), without impacting the
desmoplastic reaction (Extended Figure 6B). Overall, these results suggested an enhanced
sensitivity of EMT− cancer cells to gemcitabine. Both the equilibrative nucleoside
transporter 2 (ENT2) and the concentrating nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3) were
upregulated in EMT suppressed tumors (Figure 4G). These data support a possible
mechanistic connection between EMT program and resistance to chemotherapy in PDAC.

Collectively, our studies provide a comprehensive functional analysis of EMT program in
PDAC progression and metastasis. Absence of either Twist1 or Snai1 did not alter cancer
progression or the capacity for local invasion or metastasis to lung and liver in PDAC
GEMMs. Metastasis occurs despite a significant loss of EMT program with either the
deletion of Snail or Twist, and in both settings, Zeb1, Sox4, Slug and Zeb2 are also
significantly suppressed. Nevertheless, it is likely that other EMT inducing factors may
compensate for the loss of Snail or Twist to induce invasion and metastasis. While PDX-1 is
expressed during the development of the pancreas (in early pancreatic buds: all three major
lineages of the pancreas-ductal, acinar and beta-islets), its expression is largely repressed in
26 27
the adult exocrine pancreas , . Therefore, deletion of Snail or Twist occurs at the
embryonic stage and mice are born normal and exhibit normal pancreas histology prior to
the onset of cancer. The GEMMs with Snail or Twist deletion develop PanIN lesions at the
same frequency as the control mice. One could argue that suppression of EMT program
starting from the inception of cancer could have launched compensatory mechanisms to
overcome EMT program-dependent invasion and metastasis. However, such compensation is
not observed with respect to chemo-resistance and previous studies have demonstrated that
EMT program and cancer cell dissemination are observed even before PDAC lesions are
4
detected in KPC mice .

Our study demonstrates that EMT program results in suppression of cancer cell
proliferation, and suppression of drug transporter and concentrating proteins, therefore,
inadvertently protecting EMT+ cells from anti-proliferative drugs such as gemcitabine. The
correlation of decreased survival of pancreatic cancer patients with an increased EMT
program is likely due to their impaired capacity to respond to gemcitabine, which is a
28 29
standard of care for most patients , . Such diminished response to Gemcitabine will likely
reflect on such patients also exhibiting higher metastatic disease. Collectively, our study
offers the opportunity to evaluate the potential of targeting EMT program to enhance
30
efficacy of Gemcitabine and targeted therapies .

Snai1L/L (herein referred to as SnailcKO), Twist1L/L (herein referred to as TwistcKO), and
33
R26-LSL-EYFP . SnailcKO mice were kindly provided by S.J. Weiss, University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor. TwistcKO mice were kindly provided by R. R. Behringer (UT
MDACC, Houston, TX) via the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC)
repository. The resulting progeny were referred to as KPC, KPC; SnailcKO, KPC; TwistcKO,
KTC, and KTC; SnailcKO mice and were maintained on a mixed genetic background. Both
males and females were used indiscriminately. Mice were given Gemcitabine (G-4177, LC
Laboratories) via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) every other day at 50 mg/kg of body weight.
Hypoxyprobe was injected in a subset of mice i.p. at 60 mg/kg of body weight 30 minutes
prior to euthanasia. For in vivo colonization assay, one million KPC, KPC; TwistcKO and
KPC; SnailcKO tumor cells in 100 μL of PBS were injected intravenously via the retroorbital venous sinus. Four to eleven mice were injected per cell line. All mice were
euthanized at 15 days post-injection. All mice were housed under standard housing
conditions at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) animal facilities, and all animal
procedures were reviewed and approved by the MDACC Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Tumor growth met the standard of a diameter less than or equal to 1.5 cm.
Investigators were not blinded for group allocation but were blinded for the assessment of
the phenotypic outcome assessed by histological analyses. No randomization method or
statistical sample size estimation was used.

Red were previously described , . Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and
sectioned at 5 μm thickness. MTS was performed using Gomori's Trichome Stain Kit
(38016SS2, Leica Biosystems). Picrosirius red staining for collagen was performed using
0.1% picrosirius red (Direct Red80; Sigma) and counterstained with Weigert's hematoxylin.
Sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histopathological
measurements were assessed by scoring H&E stained tumors for relative percentages of
each histopathological phenotype: normal (non-neoplastic), PanIN, well-differentiated

PDAC, moderately-differentiated PDAC, poorly-differentiated PDAC, sarcomatoid
carcinoma, or necrosis. When tumor histology was missing or of poor quality, the mice were
excluded from all analyses and this was determined blinded from genotype information. A
histological invasion score of the tumor cells into the surrounding stroma was scored on a
scale of 0 to 2, with 0 indicating no invasion and 2 indicating high invasion, where invasion
is defined as tumor cell dissemination throughout the stroma away from clearly defined
epithelial “nests”. Microscopic metastases were observed in H&E stained tissue sections of
the liver, lung and spleen. Positivity (one or more lesions in a tissue) was confirmed using
CK19 and YFP immunohistochemistry. This data has been presented as a contingency table
(Figure 2E) and represented as the number of positive tissues out of the number of tissues
scored. The “Any” metastasis score is the number of mice positive for a secondary lesion
found anywhere throughout the body out of the total number of mice scored.

In situ hybridization

Author Manuscript

In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on frozen tumor sections as previously
34
described . In brief, 10 μm-thick sections were hybridized with antisense probes to Twist1
and Snai1 overnight at 65°C. After hybridization, sections were washed and incubated with
AP-conjugated sheep anti-DIG antibody (1:2000; Roche) for 90 min at room temperature.
After three washes, sections were incubated in BM Purple (Roche) until positive staining
was seen. Digoxigenin labeled in situ riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription
method (Promega and Roche) using a PCR template. The following primers were used to
generate the template PCR product. Twist1; forward (5’CGGCCAGGTACATCGACTTC-3’) and reverse (5’TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTTAAAAGTGTGCCCCACGC-3’) Snai1: forward

Gene Expression Profiling
Total RNA was isolated from tumors of KPC control, KPC; TwistcKO and KPC; SnailcKO
mice (n = 3 in each group) by TRIzol (15596026, Life Technologies) and submitted to the
Microarray Core Facility at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Gene expression analysis was
performed using Mouse Ref6 Gene Expression Bead Chip (Illumina). The Limma package
35
from R Bioconductor was used for quantile normalization of expression arrays and to
analyze differentially expressed genes between cKO and control sample groups (p ≤ 0.05
and fold change ≥ 1.2). Gene expression microarray data was deposited in GEO (Accession
number GSE66981). Genes up-regulated in cells acquiring an EMT program were expected
to be down-regulated in the TwistcKO and SnailcKO tumors compared to control tumors.

CTC assays
Blood (200 μL) was collected from KPC;LSL-YFP and KPC; TwistcKO;LSL-YFP (ROSALSL-YFP lineage tracing of cancer cells) mice and incubated with 10 ml of ACK lysis
buffer (A1049201, Gibco) at room temperature to lyse red blood cells. Cell pellets were
resuspended in 2% FBS containing PBS and analyzed for the number of YFP+ cells by flow
cytometry (BD LSRFortessa X-20 Cell Analyzer). The data was expressed as the percent
YFP+ cells from gated cells, with 100,000 cells analyzed at the time of acquisition. Whole
blood cell pellets were also assayed for the expression of KrasG12D transcripts, using
quantitative real-time PCR analyses (described below).
Primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell culture and analyses

Derivation of primary PDAC cell lines were performed as previously described . Fresh
tumors were minced with sterile razor blades, digested with dispase II (17105041, Gibco, 4
mg/ml)/collagenase IV (17104019, Gibco, 4 mg/ml)/RPMI for 1 h at 37°C, filtered by a 70
μm cell strainer, resuspended in RPMI/20%FBS and then seeded on collagen I coated plates
(087747, Fisher Scientific). Cells were maintained in RPMI medium with 20% FBS and 1%
penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B (PSA) antibiotic mixture. Cancer cells were
further purified by FACS based on YFP or E-Cadherin expression (anti-E-cadherin antibody,
50-3249-82, eBioscience, 1:100). The sorted cells, using BD FACSAria™ II sorter (South

expanded in vitro. All studies were performed on cells cultivated less than 30 passages. As
these are primary cell lines no further authentication methods were applicable and no
mycoplasma tests were performed.
MTT and drug sensitivity assays

Author Manuscript

MTT assay was performed to detect cell proliferation and viability by using Thiazolyl Blue
Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT, M2128, Sigma) following the manufacturer's recommendations
with an incubation of two hours at 37°C. For the drug treatment studies, a cell line derived
from each of the KPC, KPC; SnailcKO and KPC; TwistcKO mice was treated with 20 μM
Gemcitabine (G-4177, LC Laboratories) or 100 μM erlotinib (5083S, NEB) for 48 hours.
The relative cell viability was detected using MTT assay with a cell line derived from each
of the KPC, KPC; SnailcKO and KPC; TwistcKO mice. N value is defined as biological
replicates of a single cell line. Control conditions included 1% DMSO vehicle for erlotinib.
The relative absorbance was normalized and control (time 0 hour or vehicle treated)
arbitrarily set to 1 or 100% for absorbance or drug survival, respectively.
Quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qPCR)

Author Manuscript

RNA was extracted from whole blood cell pellets following ACK lysis using the PicoPure
Extraction kit as directed (KIT0214, Arcturus), or from cultured primary pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells using TRIzol (15596026, Life Technologies). cDNA was synthetized
using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (N8080234, Applied Biosystems) or High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (4368814, Applied Biosystems). Primers for
KrasG12D recombination are: KrasG12D forward (5’ ACTTGTGGTGGTTGGAGCAGC 3’),
KrasG12D reverse (5’ TAGGGTCATACTCATCCACAA 3’). 1/ΔCt values are presented to
show KrasG12D expression in indicated experimental groups, statistical analyses were
assayed on ΔCt. Primer sequences for EMT related genes are listed in Supplemental Table 1,
GAPDH was used as an internal control. The data is presented as the relative fold change
and statistical analyses were assayed on ΔCt.
Tumor sphere assay
33

Author Manuscript

Tumor sphere assays were performed as previously described . Two million cultured
primary tumor cells were plated in a low-adherence 100mm dish (FB0875713, Fisherbrand)
with 1% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and penicillin/
streptomycin/amphotericin. Cells were incubated for seven days and formed spheres were
counted at 100x magnification. Three, two and three cell lines were analyzed for KPC
control, KPC; TwistcKO and KPC; SnailcKO group, respectively, five field of views per cell
line were quantified.
MRI Analyses
37

MRI imaging was performed using a 7T small animal MR system as previously described .
To measure tumor volume, suspected regions were drawn blinded on each slice based on
normalized intensities. The volume was calculated by the addition of delineated regions of
interest in mm2 × 1 mm slice distance. None of the mice had a tumor burden that exceeded

1.5 cm in diameter, in accordance with institutional regulations. All mice with measurable
tumors were enrolled in the study (see Extended Table 3). Mice were imaged twice, once at
the beginning of the enrollment (Day 0), and a second time 20 days (Day 19) afterwards.
Surviving animals were euthanized at end point (Day 21) for histological characterization.
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

Statistical analyses were performed on the mean values of biological replicates in each
group using unpaired two-tailed or one-tailed t-tests (qPCR only), one-way ANOVA with
Tukey's multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism, as stipulated in the figure legends.
χ2 analyses, using SPSS statistical software, were performed comparing control to cKO
groups for metastatic or colonization frequency across multiple histological parameters in all
mice and mice ≥ 120 days of age. Fisher's Exact P value was used to determine significance.
Results are outlined in Extended Table 2. Kaplan-Meier plots were drawn for survival
analysis and the log rank Mantel-Cox test was used to evaluate statistical differences, using
GraphPad Prism. Data met the assumptions of each statistical test, where variance was not
equal (determined by an F-test) Welch's correction for unequal variances was applied. Error
bars represent s.e.m. when multiple visual fields were averaged to produce a single value for
each animal which was then averaged again to represent the mean bar for the group in each
graph. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
