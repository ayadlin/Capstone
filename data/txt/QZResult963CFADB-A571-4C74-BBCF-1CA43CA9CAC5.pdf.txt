Abstract
Exercise has beneficial effects on human health, including protection against metabolic disorders
such as diabetes1. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely
understood. The lysosomal degradation pathway, autophagy, is an intracellular recycling system
that functions during basal conditions in organelle and protein quality control2. During stress,
increased levels of autophagy permit cells to adapt to changing nutritional and energy demands

through protein catabolism3. Moreover, in animal models, autophagy protects against diseases
such as cancer, neuro-degenerative disorders, infections, inflammatory diseases, ageing and
insulin resistance4-6. Here we show that acute exercise induces autophagy in skeletal and cardiac
muscle of fed mice. To investigate the role of exercise-mediated autophagy in vivo, we generated
mutant mice that show normal levels of basal autophagy but are deficient in stimulus (exercise- or
starvation)-induced autophagy. These mice (termed BCL2 AAA mice) contain knock-in mutations
in BCL2 phosphorylation sites (Thr69Ala, Ser70Ala and Ser84Ala) that prevent stimulus-induced
disruption of the BCL2-beclin-1 complex and autophagy activation. BCL2 AAA mice show
decreased endurance and altered glucose metabolism during acute exercise, as well as impaired
chronic exercise-mediated protection against high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance. Thus,
exercise induces autophagy, BCL2 is a crucial regulator of exercise- (and starvation)- induced
autophagy in vivo, and autophagy induction may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of
exercise.

To investigate whether autophagy is induced by exercise, we analysed tissues of mice that
transgenically express a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled marker of
autophagosomes, GFP–LC3 (LC3 is also known as MAP1LC3) (ref. 7), after treadmill
exercise. In both skeletal and cardiac muscle, autophagosome (GFP–LC3 puncta) numbers
increased after 30 min (~300 m) of running and reached a plateau at 80 min (~900 m) (Fig.
1a–c). This was observed in several muscle groups, including the vastus lateralis (thigh
muscle) (Fig. 1a–c), soleus, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Exercise also resulted in biochemical evidence of skeletal and cardiac muscle
autophagy, including conversion of the non-lipidated form of LC3, LC3-I, to the
autophagosome-membrane-associated lipidated form, LC3-II, and degradation of the
autophagy substrate protein p62 (Fig. 1d). In addition, exercise induced autophagy in other
organs involved in glucose and energy homeostasis, such as liver and pancreas, including
islet β-cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a–af) and (based on LC3-II conversion) adipose tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 2g). Thus, exercise is a newly defined stimulus that induces autophagy
in vivo.

$watermark-text

We found that exercise-induced autophagy in vivo involves disruption of the BCL2–beclin-1
complex. BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagy protein that inhibits autophagy
through a direct interaction with the BH3 domain of the autophagy protein beclin 1 at the
endoplasmic reticulum8. Disruption of the BCL2–beclin-1 complex is crucial for stimulusinduced autophagy in mammalian cells8. Beclin 1 immunoprecipitation with BCL2
decreased in muscle within 15 min of exercise and was barely detectable after 30 min (Fig.
1e). Dissociation of the BCL2–beclin-1 complex was not associated with phosphorylation of
kinases previously linked to BCL2 phosphorylation, such as JNK and p38 MAPK9
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
To study the physiological functions of exercise-induced autophagy in vivo, we constructed
mutant mice that are deficient in stimulus-induced but not basal autophagy. As
phosphorylation of three sites in the non-structured loop of human BCL2 is critical for
stimulus-induced autophagy in vitro8, we generated knock-in (Bcl2AAA) mice lacking three
conserved phosphorylation residues in the non-structured loop region of mouse BCL2: Thr
69, Ser 70 and Ser 84 (homologous to human Ser 87) were replaced by alanines (BCL2
AAA) (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Homozygous Bcl2AAA mice were viable and fertile, born
in the expected Mendelian ratio, of normal size and weight, and displayed normal histology
of major organs (data not shown). Steady-state levels of BCL2 AAA in Bcl2AAA mice were
similar to those of wild-type (WT) BCL2 in Bcl2WT mice in skeletal and cardiac muscle,
liver, adipose tissue and pancreas (Supplementary Fig. 4d).

Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from BCL2 AAA mice showed a defect in
stimulus-induced autophagy (Fig. 2a, b). In response to starvation, BCL2 underwent
phosphorylation, BCL2 dissociated from beclin 1, and autophagy was induced in MEFs
from isogenic wild-type mice. However, in BCL2 AAA MEFs, BCL2 phosphorylation was
absent (as measured by p32 labelling), the BCL2–beclin-1 complex was not disrupted, and
less autophagy was induced. Levels of basal autophagy were similar in wild-type and BCL2
AAA MEFs. Similar findings were observed in vivo in skeletal and cardiac muscle
(Supplementary Fig. 5); autophagosomenumbers were similar at baseline in wild-type and
BCL2 AAA mice expressing GFP–LC3 but failed to increase in GFP–LC3 BCL2 AAA
mice in response to 48 h starvation.

$watermark-text

To evaluate whether BCL2 AAA mice are deficient in exercise-induced autophagy, we
exercised GFP–LC3 wild-type mice and GFP–LC3 BCL2 AAA mice for a fixed time and
fixed distance (80 min (~900 m)) and at 75% of their maximal running capacity (see Fig.
3a). Under both conditions, BCL2 AAA mice displayed marked impairment of exerciseinduced upregulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle (as measured by numbers of GFP–LC3
puncta) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). BCL2 AAA mice also exhibited less
exercise-induced LC3-II conversion and p62 degradation in skeletal and cardiac muscle
(Fig. 2e), impaired autophagic responses in liver and pancreaticβ-cells (Supplementary Fig.
2c, f), and defectiveexercise-induced dissociation of the BCL2-beclin-1 complex in muscle
(Fig. 2f). Thus, non-phosphorylatable BCL2 does not alter basal autophagy in vivo, but
prevents autophagy activation in response to starvation and exercise. This blockade of
autophagy activation was not associated with increased cell death (Supplementary Fig. 6).

$watermark-text

The deficient exercise-induced autophagy in BCL2 AAA mice was accompanied by lower
maximal exercise capacity (Fig. 3a). BCL2 AAA mice had similar levels of serum lactate
after maximal exercise, similar baseline muscle strength, and similar baseline cardiac
function and size as wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). Characterization of various
muscle groups (soleus, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus) from wild-type and
BCL2 AAA mice at baseline and after 80 min of exercise revealed no differences in weight,
fibre cross-sectional area, morphology (haematoxylin and eosin staining), fibre type
analysis, glycogen content, or mitochondrial content and functionality (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Figs 8–10). These analyses suggest that differences in baseline cardiac and
skeletal muscle properties do not account for decreased exercise endurance in BCL2 AAA
mice.

$watermark-text

During strenuous exercise, mammals undergo metabolic changes to increase skeletal muscle
glucose uptake/utilization efficiency, including increased insulin sensitivity and
redistribution of glucose transporters, such as GLUT4 (also known as SLC2A4), to the
plasma membrane10,11, which is essential for exercise-stimulated glucose uptake12.
However, BCL2 AAA mice demonstrated impaired exercise-induced increase in insulin
sensitivity, as reflected by less of a decline in plasma glucose (Fig. 3c) and plasma insulin
(Fig. 3d) levels than in wild-type mice. Also, unlike wild-type mice, BCL2 AAA mice failed
to exhibit increased plasma membrane GLUT4 localization in the vastus lateralis and soleus
muscles following maximal or 80 min exercise, respectively (Fig. 3e and Supplementary
Figs 11a and 12a) and they exhibited lower levels of radiolabelled glucose uptake in soleus
muscle (Fig. 3h).
Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a central role in enhanced
GLUT4 plasma membrane localization and skeletal muscle glucose uptake during
exercise13. BCL2 AAA mice had a notable decrease in AMPK activation, as measured by
levels of phosphorylation at residue threonine 172, in both the vastus lateralis (Fig. 3f and
Supplementary Fig. 11b) and in the soleus (Supplementary Fig. 12b) muscles.

Phosphorylation of the downstream AMPK target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) paralleled
AMPK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 13), providing additional support for a defect
in exercise-induced AMPK activation in BCL2 AAA mice.

$watermark-text

No differences were observed in phosphorylation of CaMK1, a downstream target of the
Ca2+-stimulated kinase CaMKKβ (which is upstream of AMPK in certain contexts)13
(Supplementary Fig. 13b), suggesting that differences in levels of AMPK activation between
wild-type and BCL2 AAA mice are not due to altered Ca2+ homeostasis. They are also
probably unrelated to possible effects of BCL2 on mitochondrial function, because
phosphorylated BCL2 resides at the endoplasmic reticulum14 and markers of mitochondrial
function did not differ in the muscles of BCL2 AAA and wild-type mice (Supplementary
Fig. 10). Differences in insulin signalling molecules also did not explain the altered glucose
homeostasis in exercised BCL2 AAA mice, because at late time points during exercise,
decreased (not increased) AKT activation and mTOR activation was observed in muscle of
both wild-type and BCL2 AAA mice (Supplementary Fig. 13a). No differences were
observed in muscle phosphorylation of the AKT substrate AS160 (also known as TBC1D4),
or levels of the muscle-specific forkhead transcription factor target atrogin 1 (also known as
FBXO32), in response to exercise or between genotypes.

$watermark-text

To confirm that the observed defects in exercise-induced endurance and muscle glucose
metabolism are due to defective autophagy, we examined mice with allelic loss of the
autophagy gene beclin 1 (Becn1), which have decreased beclin 1 protein expression and
decreased starvation-induced autophagy in skeletal muscle15. Similar to BCL2 AAA mice,
Becn1+/− mice exhibited deficient exercise-induced autophagy in skeletal muscle
(Supplementary Fig. 14a, b), normal muscle strength (Supplementary Fig. 14c), decreased
maximal treadmill running distance (Fig. 3g), impaired exercise-induced GLUT4 plasma
membrane localization (Supplementary Fig. 14d) and muscle glucose uptake (Fig. 3h), and
lower levels of exercise-induced muscle AMPK activation (phospho-AMPK and its target,
phospho-ACC) (Supplementary Fig. 14e) than wild-type controls. The similarity of the
phenotypes of BCL2 AAA and Becn1+/− mice provides strong support for a role of deficient
beclin 1 activity, rather than other BCL2-regulated functions, in the impairment of exercise
endurance, glucose uptake and AMPK activation in BCL2 AAA mice.

$watermark-text

AMPK activates autophagy in response to low energy conditions by sensing the cellular
ratio of AMP to ATP13. Deficient AMPK activation in BCL2 AAA and Becn1+/− mice
during exercise raised the possibility that, similar to observations in vitro16, the autophagy
pathway may function in vivo in a feed-forward manner in AMPK activation. To evaluate
whether impaired exercise-induced AMPK activation in vivo is due to deficient autophagy,
rather than potential autophagy-independent effects of the BCL2 AAA mutation or
monoallelic loss of beclin 1, we examined exercise-induced AMPK activation in Atg16l1HM
mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 (ref. 17), an essential autophagy protein that
specifies the LC3 lipidation site for autophagosomal membrane biogenesis18. Atg16l1HM
mice had a significant reduction in ATG16L1 protein expression in skeletal muscle and a
defect in exercise-induced autophagy in muscle lysates after 80 min of exercise
(Supplementary Fig. 15a, b). This defect in exercise-induced autophagy was associated with
decreased exercise-induced AMPK phosphorylation and ACC phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 15c).
Together, our in vivo studies in BCL2 AAA, Becn1+/− and Atg16l1HM mice suggest that
cellular autophagy function is partially required for normal levels of exercise-induced
muscle AMPK activation. The mechanism underlying this requirement is not yet known, but
is unlikely to be caused by non-specific effects of the mouse mutations on AMPK activation
as the direct AMPK activator, the AMP analogue 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside

MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 16).

We next examined whether exercise-induced autophagy is required for
thebeneficialmetabolic effectsoflong-term exercisetraining, using a high-fat diet (HFD)
model of obesity and impaired glucose tolerance6,19. Age-matched cohorts of wild-type
andBCL2 AAA mice werefed a HFD for four weeks; the HFD was continued for an
additional 8 weeks either combined with 50 min of daily treadmill exercise or with no
exercise (Supplementary Fig. 17a). In both wild-type and BCL2 AAA mice, HFD led to
body weight gain (Supplementary Fig. 17b), which was probably due to increased fat mass
(Supplementary Fig. 18a), as no differences in lean mass or muscle fibre size were observed
(Supplementary Fig. 18). HFD led to modest suppression of baseline autophagy in skeletal
and cardiac muscle as measured by levels of LC3-II conversion and p62 in tissue lysates
(Supplementary Fig. 19). Ultrastructural analyses of the liver and pancreas did not reveal
any differences in HFD versus regular diet animals, in wild-type versus BCL2 AAA mice,
or in non-exercised versus exercised animals, except for hepatic lipid droplet accumulation
in all HFD-fed groups (Supplementary Fig. 20). Although BCL2 AAA mice were more
sensitive to HFD-induced obesity, 8 weeks of daily exercise reduced the magnitude of
weight gain similarly in BCL2 AAA and wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 17b). Thus,
the BCL2 AAA mutation did not alter the response of mice to HFD with respect to muscle
fibre size, the morphology of liver and pancreas, or the effect of exercise on HFD-induced
obesity.

$watermark-text
$watermark-text

However, BCL2 AAA mice failed to exhibit normal exercise-induced protection against
HFD-induced impaired glucose tolerance. Before the administration of HFD, wild-type and
BCL2 AAA mice had similar clearance rates in oral glucose tolerance tests (Fig. 4a). Four
weeks of HFD led to impaired glucose tolerance in both genotypes versus regular diet
control groups (Fig. 4b); the magnitude of this impairment was similar in BCL2 AAA and
wild-type mice despite more weight gain in the BCL2 AAA mice. However, exercise
training markedly improved glucose tolerance in HFD-fed wild-type mice but not in
autophagy-deficient BCL2 AAA mice (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 21). This failure of
BCL2 AAA mice to show improved glucose tolerance is unlikely to be due to deficient
insulin production, because at the end of the study HFD-fed wild-type and BCL2 AAA mice
displayed similar circulating fasting insulin levels (Supplementary Fig. 22a), similar levels
of insulin secretion in response to oral glucose challenge (Supplementary Fig. 22b), and
similar pancreatic β-cell morphology (Supplementary Fig. 20b). These results suggest that
BCL2-regulated functions are essential for chronic exercise-mediated protection against
HFD-induced glucose intolerance. We speculate that, as in acute exercise, this may involve
the dynamic interplay of autophagy induction and AMPK activation.
HFD-induced obesity is associated with several other metabolic changes, including
increased levels of serum leptin, an appetite-inhibiting adipokine;20 reduced levels of
circulating adiponectin21, an antidiabetic adipokine22-24; and increased serum triglycerides
and cholesterol. In HFD-fed mice, baseline levels of leptin were higher in BCL2 AAA mice
than in wild-type mice, and 8 weeks of exercise decreased serum leptin in wild-type but not
in BCL2 AAA mice (Fig. 4d). Although adiponectin levels in HFD-fed mice were similar in
the non-exercised wild-type and BCL2 AAA groups, they were significantly increased in the
exercised wild-type mice versus the exercised BCL2 AAA mice (Fig. 4d). Both serum
triglycerides and cholesterol increased in wild-type and BCL2 AAA HFD-fed mice; with
exercise, the values returned to those observed in animals fed a regular diet in wild-type but
not BCL2 AAA mice (Supplementary Fig. 23). Thus, the BCL2 AAA mutation impaired the
beneficial effects of exercise on metabolic changes induced by a HFD.

The HFD-fed, daily exercised wild-type mice weremore metabolically active than their
BCL2 AAA counterparts, as demonstrated by elevated levels of oxygen consumption, CO2
production and heat generation during a 12 h night interval when the mice were not
exercised (Supplementary Fig. 24a). In addition, in vastus lateralis muscle, wild-type mice
had elevated induction of messenger RNA for UCP1, Ucp1, a mitochondrial uncoupling
protein mainly expressed in brown adipose tissue that contributes to thermogenesis and
energy expenditure25 (Supplementary Fig. 24d). These changes were probably due to
improved metabolic fitness in response to exercise rather than alterations in food intake,
spontaneous physical activity, or general mitochondrial function. No differences were
observed in daily food intake in exercised HFD-fed wild-type and BCL2 AAA mice
(Supplementary Fig. 24b). Spontaneous physical activity was similar in HFD-fed nonexercised wild-type and BCL2 AAA mice, although there was a trend towards decreased
spontaneous physical activity in the exercised BCL2 AAA mice (Supplementary Fig. 24c).
No changes were observed with exercise in either genotype in mRNA levels of the skeletal
muscle-expressed uncoupling proteins UCP2 or UCP3, or the mitochondrial proteins
cytochrome b and c (Supplementary Fig. 24d, e).

$watermark-text

The HFD study suggests that increased autophagy triggered by exercise may be critical for
improving impaired glucose tolerance and metabolism in diet-induced obesity. However, we
cannot definitely conclude that lack of exercise-induced improvement in glucose tolerance
in HFD-fed BCL2 AAA mice is caused by deficient exercise-induced autophagy; it is
possible that other effects of the BCL2 AAA mutation are responsible for this phenotype.
Nonetheless, given our findings in acute exercise (which demonstrate impaired muscle
glucose uptake, GLUT4 plasma membrane localization and AMPK activation in autophagydeficient animals), it seems plausible that alterations in exercise-induced skeletal muscle
glucose metabolism in autophagy-deficient animals may also contribute to the failure of
exercise to reverse HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities.

$watermark-text

Our findings demonstrate that exercise is a potent inducer of autophagy, and that acute and
chronic exercise enhances glucose metabolism in mice capable of inducing autophagy but
not in autophagy-deficient mice. These beneficial metabolic effects (as well as exercise- and
starvation-induced autophagy) are blocked by a mutation in BCL2 that prevents its release
from an inhibitory interaction with the autophagy protein beclin 1. Thus, BCL2 has
previously undescribed essential roles in the in vivo regulation of stimulus-induced
autophagy as well as glucose metabolism. We propose that BCL2-regulated autophagy
activation contributes to the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise, and that manipulation
of the autophagy pathway and/or the function of the autophagy inhibitory BCL2 protein may
be a logical strategy to mimic the health effects of exercise and to prevent or treat impaired
glucose metabolism. More broadly, on the basis of this newly discovered link between
exercise, autophagy and altered metabolism, we speculate that autophagy may represent a
cellular mechanism by which exercise prolongs life and protects against cancer,
cardiovascular disorders and inflammatory diseases1.

GFP–LC3 transgenic, Becn1+/− and Atg16l1HM mice have been previously described7,15,17.
For the construction of a mouse strain with knock-in mutations in the phosphorylation sites
in the non-structured loop of BCL2 (Bcl2AAA mice), BAC clones (Incyte) were screened for
the presence of Bcl2 using the following primers: BCL2 5′,
GTGGGGCGGGAGTCGGGACT; BCL2 3′, GACCCAGAATCCACTCACAC. The Bcl2
BAC clone was digested by BglII, subcloned into pSP72, and a puromycin resistance marker
flanked by FRT sites (SalI fragment of pPGKPuro, cloned into pFRT) was blunt cloned into
a BsaBI site 3′ of exon II. A mutant allele was generated by subcloning a PstI fragment
from the coding region. Amino acid residues Thr 69, Ser 70 and Ser 84 (homologous to
human Ser 87) were changed to alanine in two steps using the Quickchange PCR
(Stratagene) and the following primer sets: TSAA 5′, GAGATGGCTGCCA
GGGCGGCTCCTCTCAGGCCCC; TSAA 3′, GGGGCCTGAGAGGAGCC
GCCCTGGCAGCCATCTC; S84A 5′, GCTGGGCCTGCGCTCGCCCC TGTGC
CACCATG; S84A 3′, CATGGTGGCACAGGGGCGAGCGCAGGCCCAGC. The
targeting construct 7.1AAA was electroporated into RW4 embryonic stem cells (129 Sv/J),
and 36 h later, clones were selected with puromycin, picked and screened by Southern blot
analysis with the probes indicated in Supplementary Fig. 4a. A 1.7 kb shift upwards
indicative of the mutant allele was detected on Southern blots in 2/300 clones as the targeted
locus (Supplementary Fig. 4b). These clones were tested for normal karyotype and used to
inject blastocysts from C57BL/6J donors. Mice with germline transmission were bred to
mice expressing FLP from the β-actin promoter (Jackson Laboratories: B6;
SJLTgN(ACTFLPe)9205Dym), and offspring were screened for deletion of the puromycin
selection marker. To screen for the presence of the mutation following excision of the
selectable marker, PCR with 5′ and 3′ Bcl2 primers was performed, and digestions were
performed with BglI or AatII enzymes; BglI cuts the amplified fragment only if the
T69AS70A site is present, while AatII cuts only the wild-type sequence for the same region
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Using this scheme, homozygous Bcl2AAA mutants were identified
by the presence of PCR fragments cleaved only by BglI and not AatII, whereas wild-type
mice were identified by the presence of PCR fragments cleaved only by AatII and not BglI.
Bcl2AAA mice were backcrossed for more than ten generations to C57/B6 mice (Jackson
Laboratories), and homozygous Bcl2AAA and Bcl2WT offspring were used in all studies.

Mouse exercise studies

$watermark-text

For acute exercise studies, 8-week-old (wild type, BCL2 AAA and Atg16l1HM) or 12-weekold (Becn1+/− and wild-type Becn1+/+ littermate) mice were acclimated to and trained on a
10° uphill Exer 3/6 open treadmill (Columbus Instruments) for 2 days. On day 1 mice ran
for 5 min at 8 m min−1 and on day 2 mice ran for 5 min at 8 m min−1 followed by another 5
min at 10 m min−1. On day 3, mice were subjected to a single bout of running starting at the
speed of 10 m min−1. Forty minutes later, the treadmill speed was increased at a rate of 1 m
min−1 every 10 min for a total of 30 min, and then increased at the rate of 1 m min−1 every 5
min until mice were exhausted. Exhaustion was defined as the point at which mice spent
more than 5 s on the electric shocker without attempting to resume running. Total running
time was recorded and total running distance was calculated for each mouse.
For long-term exercise training, male Bcl2WT or Bcl2AAA mice (8 weeks old) were
randomly divided into three cohorts, including: (1) mice fed a regular diet (Harlan Teklad)
without daily exercise, (2) mice fed a HFD containing 60% fat (Research Diets) without
daily exercise, and (3) mice fed a HFD with daily exercise. Prior to initiation of exercise,
mice were fed a HFD for 4 weeks. At the end of the fourth week, mice in the exercise
groups were acclimated to treadmill running for 2 days as in the acute exercise studies, and
then were trained on the treadmill with 10° uphill incline for 50 min d−1, 5 d week−1 at 17 m
min−1 for 8 weeks. Mice were given a HFD during the 8-week training period. All animal
procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and with approval
from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

MEFs expressing GFP–LC3 were cultured in normal or starvation (EBSS, Earle’s balanced
salt solution) medium for 4 h, and GFP–LC3 puncta were quantified by fluorescence
microscopy as described27. For assessment of autophagy in vivo following starvation or
exercise, 8-week-old Bcl2WT or Bcl2AAA GFP–LC3 mice or Becn1+/+ or Becn1+/− GFP–
LC3 mice were either subjected to starvation for 48 h or exercised for the indicated time
period, anaesthetized by isoflurane, and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Skeletal
muscle (vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus and soleus), heart (left
ventricle), pancreas and liver tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, 15% sucrose for 4 h
and 30% sucrose overnight before frozen sections were prepared. The number of GFP–LC3
puncta per unit area of tissue was quantified by fluorescence microscopy as described15.
Autophagy in skeletal and cardiac muscle, liver, pancreas and adipose tissue during baseline
conditions and after exercise was also analysed by western blot analysis of tissue extracts
with antibodies against LC3 and p62 (see below for details).
Immunofluorescence studies

$watermark-text

For immunofluorescence staining of frozen muscle and pancreatic sections, slides were
heated at 50 °C for 10 min, rehydrated in 100%, 95% and 70% ethanol, washed 3 × 5 min in
PBS, blocked with 1% goat serum and immunostained with a rabbit anti-mouse GLUT4
antibody (Alpha Diagnostic, 1:100 dilution) (muscle samples) and an Alexa Fluor 594
donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:1,000 dilution) or with a guinea pig
anti-swine insulin antibody (Dako, 1:500 dilution) (pancreatic samples) and an Alexa Fluor
594 goat anti-guinea pig secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1: 500 dilution).
Immunofluorescence studies on skeletal muscle sections with anti-laminin and anti-type I
myosin heavy chain antibodies were performed as previously described28.
Immunofluorescence images were taken using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope or Leica TCS
SP5 confocal microscope.
Muscle morphology and function studies

$watermark-text

Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to visualize tissue architecture following
standard protocols. Metachromatic ATPase staining and measurement of fibre crosssectional area were performed as previously described28. Periodic acid-Schiff staining for
carbohydrates was performed according to standard protocols29. Succinic dehydrogenase
staining on cryosections was carried out using a 0.2 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.6. For
staining, 270 mg succinic acid and 10 mg nitro blue tetrazolium were freshly dissolved in 10
ml phosphate buffer and incubated with sections for 1 h.
To measure muscle strength, a modified mesh grip assay was applied30. Briefly, mice were
placed on the wired mesh of cage tops. When they firmly grabbed the mesh, the cage top
was flipped and held at a height of 30 cm above the bench until the mice released their grip.
The time for each mouse to remain on the mesh was recorded. TUNEL staining of muscle
sections to detect apoptosis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(ApopTag Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, Millipore), using Sigma FAST 3,3′diaminobenzidine (DAB) tablets as the peroxidase substrate.
Electron microscopy
Mice were euthanized, and liver and pancreas were rapidly fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Electron microscopy was performed as previously described31.

Mouse metabolic studies and blood tests

$watermark-text

Food intake, O2 consumption, CO2 production, heat production and physical activity were
measured in TSE metabolic chambers (TSE Systems) over a 4 day period. Mice in the
exercise group were removed from the chambers and allowed to run for 50 min daily as in
the above protocol during the day (light period). Metabolic measurements were performed
for 12 h daily during the dark period. Fat mass and lean tissue mass were determined using
the Bruker Minispec mq10 scan system. Plasma glucose, lactate, cholesterol and
triglycerides were measured using the Vitros 250 system (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics).
Plasma insulin (Crystal Chem), serum leptin (Crystal Chem) and adiponectin (Millipore)
levels were determined using commercial ELISA kits. Glucose tolerance tests were
performed by oral glucose injection (1 g kg−1) after a 3 h fast. Blood was drawn from tail
veins at the indicated time points after glucose injection and serum glucose levels were
analysed using commercial glucose assay reagents (Sigma, Cat# 6918, P7119, F5803).
Echocardiography
Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography, using a Visualsonic Vevo 2100
ultrasound machine equipped with a 30-Mhz transducer applied to the chest wall.
Ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction were assessed using short axis view in twodimensional and three-dimensional modes using the onboard VisualSonics cardiac analysis
package.
Muscle glucose uptake assays

$watermark-text

Surgical catheterization of the jugular vein was performed on each mouse. At day 4 after
catheterization, mice were transferred to clean cages at 9:00 a.m. to begin a 4 h fast. Mice
then ran on a treadmill for 50 min using the exercise protocol described above. At t = 50
min, a 13 μCi bolus of 14C-deoxyglucose was injected intravenously and mice resumed
running for another 25 min according to the exercise protocol described above before
euthanasia. Skeletal muscle (soleus) and brain tissues were dissected and homogenized in
1.5 ml 0.5% perchloric acid. 14C-deoxyglucose counts were determined in homogenized
samples as previously described32 and muscle values were normalized to the counts in the
brain.
Western blot analyses

$watermark-text

Mouse tissue extracts were prepared by homogenizing tissues in lysis buffer containing 50
mM Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, proteinase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences) and halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce), and
subjected to western blot analysis with anti-LC3 (Novus Biologicals, 1:500), anti-p62 (BD
Biosciences, 1:500 dilution; Progen (C-terminal specific), 1:1,000 dilution). Anti-p-CaMKI
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), anti-CaMKI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:300), antiBCL2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1: 100), anti-AMPK (Cell Signaling, 1:1,000), anti-pAMPK (Cell Signaling, 1:1,000), anti-JNK (Cell Signaling, 1:400), anti-p-JNK (Cell

(Millipore, 1:500) anti-AKT (Cell Signaling, 1:600), anti-p-AKT (Cell Signaling, 1:500),
anti-p38 (Cell Signaling, 1:500), anti-p-p38 (Cell Signaling, 1:400), anti-atrogin-1 (ECM
Biosciences, 1:400), ATG16L1 (Sigma, 1:1,000) and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
1:3,000) antibodies.
For in vitro assessment of AMPK activation, MEFS derived from Bcl2AAA and Bcl2WT
mice, Becn1+/− and Benc1+/+ mice, and Atg16l1HM and Atg16l1WT mice were treated with
2 mM of the AMP analogue AICAR, or DMSO vehicle for 2 h. Whole-cell lysates were

prepared, and AMPK and phospho-AMPK levels were determined by western blot analysis.
For quantification, the relative intensity values of western blot bands were normalized to
that of the first lane (set as 1) in the wild-type non-exercised group.
Statistical analyses

$watermark-text

ANOVA approaches were used to compare values among different experimental groups for
data that met the normality assumption. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison
between two groups. Two-way ANOVA was used for comparison of the magnitude of
changes between two different groups in mice of two different genotypes. The normality
assumption for the ANOVA model was checked using residual plots. When the assumption
was violated, the data were log-transformed in order to meet the assumption. For data sets in
which log transformation was inadequate to meet the analysis assumption, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used.
Real-time PCR analyses

$watermark-text

RNA isolation from muscle tissues and real-time RT-PCR were performed as previously
described28. The following Sybr Green primers were used: β-actin: forward,
CTGGCTCCTAGCACCATGAAGAT; reverse, GGTGGACAGTGAGGCCAGGAT;
UCP1: forward, TCAGGATTGGCCTCTA CGAC; reverse,
