Abstract

Author Manuscript

The translational control of oncoprotein expression is implicated in many cancers. Here we report
an eIF4A/DDX2 RNA helicase-dependent mechanism of translational control that contributes to
oncogenesis and underlies the anticancer effects of Silvestrol and related compounds. For
example, eIF4A promotes T-ALL development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance.
Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with Silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects in vitro and in
vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4Adependent transcripts. These include 5′UTR sequences such as the 12-mer guanine quartet (CGG)4
motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent
and Silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, super-enhancer associated
transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5′UTRs of selected cancer genes
harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase.

Author Manuscript

The activation of translation contributes to malignant transformation and is an emerging
target for cancer therapies1,2. For example, oncogenic RAS, ERK, and AKT stimulate capdependent translation via mTORC1 and the eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP)3. The initiation
of cap-dependent translation involves a tightly controlled multi-protein initiation complex4.
This includes the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, that is abundantly expressed in cancer and can
transform fibroblasts and promote tumour development in vivo1,5–8. Another key factor is
the eIF4A RNA helicase that plays a role in scanning the mRNA 5′UTR for a translation
start site and has been implicated in the translation of mRNAs with long and complex
5′UTRs9. EIF4A is the molecular target for three distinct natural compounds – Silvestrol,
Hippuristanol, and Pateamine A – and these compounds show promising anti-cancer
activity10,11. Recent studies have defined eIF4A’s helicase action, protein interactions12, and
revealed a role in microRNA action13. Exactly how eIF4A affects translation and which
specific mRNA features necessitate its helicase activity has not been defined.

Ribosome footprinting provides a snapshot of translation across the transcriptome14. It uses
deep sequencing to identify ribosome-protected RNA fragments and compare them to total
transcript levels. Among the various applications of this technology, the most relevant to this
study concern the translational effects of mTORC1 inhibition15,16. We use ribosome
footprinting to identify eIF4A-dependent transcripts and their hallmark features.

Results
eIF4A is an oncogene in T-ALL

Author Manuscript

NOTCH-driven T-ALL exemplifies the activation of AKT/mTORC1 and cap-dependent
translation in cancer. In 36 paediatric T-ALL samples we find PTEN mutations (14%) and
deletions (11%)17, NOTCH1 mutations (56%)18, and IL7R mutation (3%)19 ( Extended Data
Fig. 1a–c, Suppl. Table 1). These genetic lesions promote T-ALL development in a murine
T-ALL model (Figure 1a)20. Notch causes T-ALL with a mean latency of 91.5 days (n =
14), knockdown of Pten or expression of the mutant IL7r/p.L242-L243ins accelerates
disease onset (PTEN: 47.1d; n = 10, p < 0.0001; IL7R: 35.5d, n = 4, p < 0.0001).
Remarkably, expression of eIF4E or eIF4A1 similarly accelerates leukaemia development
(eIF4E: 30.75d; n = 4, p < 0.0001; eIF4A1: n = 5, p < 0.0001) (Figure 1b, Extended Data
Fig. 1d). All T-ALLs are CD4/CD8 double positive, and increased ribosomal S6
phosphorylation indicates mTORC1 activation in PTEN-deficient and IL7R expressing TALLs (Extended Data Fig. 1d, f–i). EIF4E and eIF4A1 are required to maintain T-ALL and
cells expressing a constitutive 4E-BP1 allele (4E-BP1(4A))21 or an eIF4A1 knockdown
construct are rapidly eliminated from mixed populations (Figure 1c/d; Extended Data Fig.
1e) (pVector vs. 4E-BP1(4A) = 0.000002 and pVector vs. sh-eIF4A = 0.000008).

Silvestrol and a synthetic analogue (±)-CR-31-B (CR) inhibit eIF4A1/211,22. A reporter
assay confirms that both drugs preferentially block cap-dependent translation of renilla
luciferase compared to firefly luciferase expressed from the HCV IRES (Figure 2a,
Extended Data Fig. 2a). Silvestrol induces cell death in primary human T-ALL samples, cell
lines, and murine T-ALLs at nanomolar IC50s (Figure 2b, Extended Data Fig. 2b/c). In vivo
Silvestrol is effective against murine or xenografted T-ALLs (Figure 2c, Extended Data Fig.
2d–f). In KOPT-K1 tumour-bearing (~1 cm3) NOD/SCID mice, treatment with Silvestrol
(0.5 mg/kg, i.p., d 0–6, n = 7, p < 0.001) or (±)-CR-31-B (0.2 mg/kg, i.p., d 0–6, n = 8, p <
0.001) delays tumour growth, and causes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Figure 2c/d,
Extended Data Fig. 2e/f). Detailed toxicology shows that this treatment is well-tolerated in
mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a–j, Suppl. Table 2). Rapamycin induces an S6 kinase-dependent
feedback activation of AKT (T308)23, by contrast Silvestrol or (±)-CR-31-B do not trigger
this response in KOPT-K1 cells (Figure 2e/f). The result implies that inhibition of eIF4A is
effective without effect on S6 kinase.
Ribosome footprinting

Author Manuscript

For footprinting studies, we treated KOPT-K1 cells with 25 nM of Silvestrol or vehicle for
45 minutes, then deep-sequenced total RNA and ribosome protected RNA (ribosome
footprints = RFs) (Figure 3a)14. We removed reads mapping to ribosomal RNAs, noncoding RNAs, library linkers, and incomplete alignments (Extended Data Fig. 4a/b). The
majority of the remaining reads between 25–35 nucleotides in length mapped to protein
coding genes (Extended Data Fig. 4c/d). The total number of RF reads that mapped to exons
was 3.2 million in control and 3.4 million Silvestrol samples and this corresponded to
~11,128 protein coding genes. RF reads showed a wider variation between control and
Silvestrol than total RNA sequences indicating minimal transcriptional variation (Extended
Data Fig. 4e). The number of ribosomes occupying any transcript is given as gene specific

RF reads per one million total reads (RPM). The RPM frequency distribution in control and
Silvestrol samples was overlapping, indicating that Silvestrol equally affected mRNAs with
high and low ribosome occupancy (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Polysome analysis and
metabolic labelling with L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) labelling confirmed an inhibitory
effect on translation (AHA: Silvestrol ~ 60%; p(Silv. vs. Veh.) = 3.6 × 10−3; Cycloheximide
80%, p(CHX vs. Veh.) = 2 × 10−4) (Extended Data Fig. 4g/h). The translational efficiency (TE)
for each mRNA is calculated by normalizing the RF frequency to transcript length and total
transcript abundance (RPKM: reads per kilobase per million reads). RPKM values for RF
from vehicle and Silvestrol samples were correlated (R2 = 0.94) indicating an overall
inhibitory effect (Extended Data Fig. 4i).

Author Manuscript

We developed the DERseq algorithm (Differential Expression-normalized Ribosomeoccupancy; based on DEXseq24) to identify mRNAs that were most strongly affected by
Silvestrol. We used a cut-off at p < 0.03 (Z-score > 2.5) to define groups of mRNAs whose
translational efficiency was the most (TE down; red) or least (TE up; blue) affected by
Silvestrol compared to background (grey) (Figure 3b, Suppl. Table 3a–c). The TE down
group includes 281 mRNAs (220 with annotated 5′UTRs), TE up includes 190 mRNAs, and
the background list 2243 mRNAs. The footprinting methodology also provides positional
information and the rDiff algorithm identifies mRNAs with significant shifts in RF
distribution25. For example, Silvestrol caused an accumulation of RFs in the 5′UTR of 847
protein-coding transcripts (rDiff positive genes; 641 with annotated 5′UTRs; p < 0.001)
(Suppl. Table 3d). Sixty-two transcripts showed both decreased TE and altered RF
distribution, while we observed no change in distribution among TE up genes (Figure 3c,
Extended Data Fig. 5a–c, Suppl. Table 3e).

The (CGG)4 motif marks eIF4A-dependent mRNAs

Author Manuscript

We compared the TE up, TE down, and background groups (Suppl. Table 3a–c), and
confirm that mRNAs with longer 5′UTRs were significantly enriched in the TE down group
(mean UTR length: 368 nt in TE down; 250 nt in background, p(Silvestrol vs. Control) = 7.6 ×
10−12 by two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov) (Figure 3d). The TE up group showed no
difference in 5′UTR length (265 nt; p(Silvestrol vs. Control) = 0.165) (Extended Data Fig. 4j).
We found no predilection for known regulatory elements in the TE down group, these
included TOP26, TOP-like sequences15, IRES27, and pyrimidine rich translational elements
(PRTEs)26 (Figure 3e). The TE up group showed the expected enrichment in IRES elements
(Extended Data Fig. 4k). Using the DREME algorithm28 we found a striking enrichment of
a 12-mer (CGG)4 motif and related but shorter 9-mer motifs among the 220 TE down genes
(Figure 3f/g, Suppl. Table 4a/b). Both 12-mer and 9-mer motifs were significantly enriched
over background and their frequency was significantly higher than expected merely by the
longer UTR length (p < 2.2 × 10−16; one-sided binomial test) (Figure 3h). We found no
enriched motif in the TE up group. Transcripts with an altered RF distribution (rDiff
positive) showed similar features. These included longer 5′UTRs (rDiff: 271 nucleotides
versus background: 230 nucleotides; p = 0.004) (Extended Data Fig. 5d) and absence of
enrichment for TOP, TOP-like, PTRE, or IRES elements (Extended Data Fig. 5e).
Strikingly, we again identified the 12-mer motif seen in the TE analysis but shifted by one
nucleotide (Extended Data Fig. 5f, Suppl. Table 4c), along with 9-mer variants, highly

significantly enriched in the rDiff positive set compared to background (p = 2.2 × 10−16)
(Extended Data Fig. 5g; Suppl. Table 4d).
The (CGG)4 motif corresponds to G-quadruplexes
We noticed that in many instances the 5′UTR motifs coincided with computationally
predicted G-quadruplex (GQ) structures29. For example 51% of the 12-mer (CGG)4
sequences and 43% of the most common 9-mer localized precisely to the GQ structures –
the ADAM10 5′UTR provides an example (Figure 4a/b, Extended Data Fig. 6a, Suppl.
Table 4e–k). GQ structures form by non-Watson-Crick interactions between paired guanine
nucleotides that align parallel or anti-parallel arrangements in different planes connected by
at least one linker nucleotide (A or C). Accordingly, GQ structures were significantly
enriched among TE down genes and 79/220 TE down transcripts harboured at least one GQ
(p = 2 × 10−11) (Figure 4a–c, Suppl. Table 4e–k).

We confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) that the 12-mer and extended 9-mer sequence
motifs form GQs. Briefly, we compared the molar ellipticity of RNA oligomers encoding
the 12-mer and the 9-mer motifs to a known GQ element in the human telomeric RNA30 and
a randomly organized oligomer with equal GC content and length. The 9-mers included
either two (oligo 1) or five (oligo 2) flanking nucleotides as seen in the 5′UTRs of MTA2,
TGFB1, MAPKAP1, and ADAM10 (Suppl. Table 5). The human telomeric sequence, the
12-mer and the 9-mer motifs showed typical positive and negative molar ellipticity peaks at
264 nm and 240 nm indicating parallel GQ structures. By contrast, the random oligomer had
a shift in peak wavelengths (270 and 233 nm) (Figure 4d/e, Extended Data Fig. 6b). This
effect was dependent on the presence of potassium and was abrogated in sodium phosphate
buffer without potassium (Extended Data Fig. 6c). CD combined with thermal unfolding
revealed that under potassium conditions the melting temperature for the 12-mer motif was
higher (56°C) than the random oligomer (49°C), corresponding to a free energy difference
of −32 kcal/mol (Figure 4f). Similarly, computational modelling of complete 5′UTRs with
increasing numbers of motifs showed a decrease of the predicted minimum free energy
(MFE) when the 5′UTR is allowed to fold into GQs (Figure 4g). Hence, the 12-mer and
some of the 9-mer motifs can form energetically favourable GQ structures (Figure 4h).

Author Manuscript

Next, we tested the 12-mer (CGG)4 in a translation assay. We constructed a reporter system
to compare four 12-mer motifs in tandem (GQ construct) to a random sequence of equal
length and GC content (control construct), using IRES firefly luciferase as internal control
(Figure 4i). Treatment with Silvestrol (25 nM) reduced the translation of the GQ construct
and did not affect the control construct, Hippuristanol and Pateamine A had identical effects
(Extended Data Fig. 6d), whereas cycloheximide (CHX, 20nM) suppressed both reporters
(Figure 4j/k). Other RNA helicases (DHX9, DHX36) may resolve GQ structures30,31.
However, we find predominant expression of eIF4A2 in T-ALL32, and knockdown confirms
an eIF4A-dependent effect on the GQ reporter (Figure 4l, Extended Data Fig. 6e).
Conversely, increased expression of eIF4A or a Silvestrol-binding site mutant of eIF4A
(P159Q)33 renders the GQ reporter insensitive to Silvestrol (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Hence,
eIF4A is limiting for the translation of mRNAs harbouring GQs in their 5′UTRs.

What transcripts are affected by Silvestrol?

Author Manuscript

The Silvestrol sensitive transcripts (TE down and rDiff gene lists) include many genes with
known roles in T-ALL (Figure 5a/b). The individual RF distribution graphs (normalized for
mean RF count and gene length) illustrate recurrent patterns and also variations (Extended
Data Fig. 7a). For example, the MYC, MDM2, and RUNX1 transcripts harbour multiple
motifs in their 5′UTRs that correspond to peaks in RF density, while housekeeping genes
show no changes in RF profiles. Gene ontology reveals a preponderance of transcription
factors and oncogenes, but also some tumour suppressors (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Further,
we note a significant enrichment of “super-enhancer”-associated genes34 - mostly
transcription factors like NOTCH1, MYC, MYB, ETS1 and others (Figure 5c, Extended
Data Fig. 7c, Suppl. Table 6).

Author Manuscript

We confirmed the Silvestrol effects (25 nM for 24h) on key target proteins (Figure 5d,
Extended Data Fig. 7a). The effect on the MYC protein was especially striking, it lasted for
up 48h, and was readily detected in xenografts in vivo (Figure 5d–f, Extended Data Fig.
8a/b). The corresponding mRNAs were unchanged, and the increase in MYC mRNA may
reflect a known auto-regulatory mechanism35 (Extended Data Fig. 8c). To test which
proteins account for Silvestrol’s effects, we expressed several candidate genes and GFP in
an eIF4A-independent manner from the HCV IRES. In mixed populations of transduced and
parental murine leukemic cells (see Fig. 1c), we found that individually genes were not
protective, while co-expression of IRES-MYC and IRES-BCL2 afforded significant
protection (Figure 5g, Extended Data Fig. 8d–g). This result indicates that Silvestrol kills
cancer cells by disrupting the translation of several critical factors.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

A selective mechanism of translational control

Author Manuscript

We report an eIF4A-dependent mechanism of translational control that is encoded in the
5′UTR of susceptible transcripts (Figure 5h). The eIF4A RNA helicase has been implicated
in the translation of mRNAs with long and complex 5′UTRs9. Ribosome footprinting
technology allowed us to identify Silvestrol-sensitive mRNAs and analyse their hallmark
features. Besides 5′UTR length, these included a 12-mer (CGG)4 motif, additional 9-mer
motifs, and computationally predicted GQ structures that correspond to the motif. RNA GQs
are energetically favourable/stable RNA structures made from at least two stacks of four
guanosines with non-Watson-Crick interactions (Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds) with
intervening linker nucleotides29. The minimum number is twelve nucleotides, e.g. in the 12mer motif (CGG)4, and shorter 9-mer motifs include neighbouring nucleotides to complete
the structure. Frequently more than 12 nucleotides contribute to GQs, and typically
Silvestrol-sensitive transcripts harbour several GQs in their 5′UTRs. These features define a
specific subset of genes whose translation requires eIF4A and that is clearly distinct form
mTORC1-dependent translation15,16.
Many transcription factors and oncogenes require eIF4A for translation. GQ structures have
been observed e.g. in the NRAS and VEGF mRNAs36–38, and computational predictions
have suggested a broader role in translational regulation39. Our results identify a broad set of

Author Manuscript

eIF4A sensitive transcripts including many oncogenes and transcriptional regulators (e.g.
MYC, MYB, NOTCH, CDK6, BCL2, and others). We can speculate that this mechanism
provides additional control over these genes. In this regard, we note a recent study identified
a role for eIF4A2 in microRNA function and reports that eIF4A sensitive transcripts are
more likely controlled by microRNAs13. We further find a significant overlap with genes
whose transcription is controlled by “super-enhancers”34.

Author Manuscript

Our study provides new insight into the striking anticancer effect of Silvestrol and related
compounds. Several strategies are available to target oncoprotein translation (e.g. mTORC
inhibitors15, an eIF4G inhibitory peptide 4EGI-140, or ribavirin41). We find that eIF4A is an
oncogenic activity that is required for the expression of key oncogenes. Accordingly,
Silvestrol can obliterate oncoproteins including MYC, NOTCH, BCL2, and others. This
finding suggests potential activity in other cancers as single agent or in combination with
other drugs.

Extended Experimental Procedures
(Non-radioactive) Metabolic labelling of nascent protein

Author Manuscript

KOPTK1 cells were labelled for nascent protein synthesis using Click-iTR AHA (Lazidohomoalanine) metabolic labelling reagent obtained from Invitrogen (cat no. C10102) as
per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, following Silvestrol, Cycloheximide or DMSO
treatment, cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 30 min prior to AHA
labelling for 1 hour. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min followed by one wash with 3%
BSA. Cells were then stained using Alexa Fluor 488 Alkyne (Invitrogen cat no. A10267)
with Click-iT Cell reaction Buffer Kit (Invitrogen cat no. C10269). Changes in mean
fluorescence intensity as a measure of newly synthesized protein were detected by Flow
cytometric analysis.
Polysome profiling—KOPTK1 cells were treated with Silvestrol or DMSO for 45
minutes, followed by cycloheximide treatment for 10 minutes. Cell pellet was lysed in
polysome lysis buffer (300mM NaCl, 15mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15mM MgCl2, 1%
TritonX-100, 0.1mg/ml Cycloheximide, 1mg/ml Heparin). Polysome fractions were isolated
using 4 ml 10–50% sucrose density gradients (300mM NaCl, 100mM MgCl2, 15mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 1mg/ml Cycloheximide, 10mg/ml Heparin). Gradients were centrifuged in an
SW40Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2 hours. Fractions of 100 μl were collected manually from
the top, and optical density (OD) at 254 nm was measured.

Sequence Alignment
The human genome sequence hg19 was downloaded from UCSC public database: http://
hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes. Ribosome footprint (RF) reads
were aligned to reference genome hg19 using PALMapper42. PALMapper clips the linker
sequence (5′-CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT-3′), which is technically introduced during RF
library construction, and trims the remaining sequence from the 3′ end while aligning the
reads to reference sequence. Briefly, we set the parameters for PALMapper as follows:

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 06.

Wolfe et al.

Author Manuscript

maximum number of mismatches: 2; maximum number of gaps: 0; minimum aligning
length: 15; maximum intron length (splice alignment): 10000; minimum length of a splicing
read aligned to either side of the intron boundary: 10. We only use the uniquely aligned
reads for further analysis.
To remove ribosome RNA contamination, the footprint reads were also aligned to a
ribosome sequence database using PALMapper with the same parameters except allowing
splice alignment. We retrieved the human ribosome sequences from BioMart Ensembl43 and
SILVA44 databases and merged the results into a single FASTA file, which was used as
reference sequence to align against. The rRNA-aligned reads were filtered out from hg19aligned reads.

Author Manuscript

After removing the rRNA contamination, we still observed a portion of reads that were
dominated by linker sequence and Illumina P7 adapter. These reads can also be trimmed
during mapping and cause false alignment. Therefore, we searched a string of 1~8 nt from
linker sequence around the trimming site (±2 bp) allowing 1 nt mismatch. We removed the
read if there was no such linker sequence. Finally, we filtered out reads ≤ 24-bp and ≥ 36bp, and the remaining reads with aligned length from 25- to 35-bp were used to analyse the
translational effects of Silvestrol.
Total mRNA sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 reference using STAR45. We
performed the splice alignment and only use the uniquely aligned reads with maximum 3
mismatches. rRNA contaminating reads were also filtered out using the same strategy
described before. Out of six measurements we removed two outliers and the remaining two
biological replicates showed excellent consistency (Control: R2 = 0.90; Silvestrol: R2 = 0.88;
data not shown).

Footprint Profile Analysis

Author Manuscript

For each gene, we only counted the number of aligned reads that were mapped within
exonic regions. The genome annotation was downloaded from GENCODE project (http://
www.gencodegenes.org/releases/14.html). Ribosome footprint intensity (reads per million,
RPM) was calculated as RPM = Ci/(N/106), where Ci is the read count for gene i, and N is
the library size of Silvestrol- or vehicle-treated samples. In order to eliminate the effluence
of rRNA contamination, the library size was calculated after read filtering described
previously. Similarly, the expression value measured from total mRNA-seq data and
translation value measured from ribosome footprint data (both were referred as reads per
kilobase per million, RPKM) were calculated as RPKM = Ci/(Ki · N/106), where Ki is the
non-overlapped exonic region of each gene. To evaluate the translation efficiency (TE)
change between Silvestrol- and vehicle-treated samples, we then calculated TE =
RPKMfootprint/RPKMmRNA as Thoreen et al did recently15.
To detect the genes that ribosome footprint profiles were significantly changed between
Silvestrol treated sample and control, we used DEXSeq24 to perform the statistical test.
DEXSeq accounts for the discrete nature of the read counts and it also models the biological
variability, which has been demonstrated in other applications to be crucial to avoid a great
number of false positives. Here, DEXSeq was used in a specific way: we fit the footprint

and mRNA-seq read counts into DEXseq framework, in which Silvestrol treatment and
control are two biological conditions, and we tested whether footprint (consisting 2
replicates for each condition) and mRNA-seq (We split the 3 replicates and recombined
them into two combinations such that each of them consists of two replicates.) read counts
were significantly different in the two conditions. The log-ratio of normalized read counts of
Silvestrol treated sample to control indicated whether ribosome footprint profile was
increased or decreased. In the end, we plotted the ratio of TEsilvestrol/TEcontrol of all the
genes and colour-highlighted them according to the statistical significance of the DEXSeq
test.

Author Manuscript

In addition to studying the translation efficiency, we also evaluated the ribosomal
distribution change between Silvestrol treated sample and control. First, a BED file
contained all non-overlapped exonic regions was generated based on genome annotation.
Then the BED file and footprint BAM files were given as an input to SAMTOOLS46 to
generate new BAM files only included exonic alignment. We input the exonic BAM files of
two conditions to rDiff25 to identify genes that presented significant change in ribosomal
distribution. In detail, we performed a nonparametric test implemented in rDiff to detect
differential read densities. rDiff takes relevant read information, such as the mapping
location and the read structure, to measure the significance of changes in the read density
within a given gene between two conditions. The minimal read length was set to 25-bp, and
number of permutation was set to 10000.

To plot the ribosomal distribution curves for multiple genes, we normalized read coverage
of each transcript by the mean coverage value of that particular transcript. Then the UTR
and coding exon length were normalized in proportion to the overall average length of
corresponding regions of a group of genes. Finally all the normalized transcripts were
averaged together in a vectored way to plot the coverage distribution. The ribosomal
distribution curves for a single gene were plotted in a similar way but without normalizing
the read coverage, and the coverage was smoothed using ‘moving average’ smoothing
algorithm.
Motif analysis

Author Manuscript

The transcripts of each gene were quantified based on the total mRNA-seq data using
MISO47. The 5′UTR of most abundant transcript was collected for predicting motifs. Both
the significant genes with increased or decreased TE and altered ribosomal distribution and
the corresponding background gene sets were predicted by DREME28. Over- and underrepresented motifs were determined with three different settings: searching for motifs of
length greater than or equal to six, nine and twelve base pairs. We considered the predicted
consensus sequences with P < 1×10−4 as significant motifs. Motif occurrences were called
using FIMO48 with default parameters for strand specific prediction. P-values for the
enrichment of Motifs in GQs were calculated using a one-sided binomial test and account
for UTR length. The secondary structure of different gene sets was predicted using
RNAfold49 based on the same 5′UTR prepared before.
5′UTR sequences for respective group of targets were subjected to motif prediction using
online available program RegRNA (A Regulatory RNA motifs and Elements Finder) (http://

in 5′UTR. Statistical significance for the results obtained was calculated using Fisher’s exact
test for count data.
Luciferase assays
Four tandem repeats of the (CGG)4 12-mer motif (GQs) or random sequence matched for
length and GC content (random) were cloned into the 5′UTR of Renilla luciferase plasmid
pGL4.73. Empty firefly luciferase plasmid pGL4.13 or HCV-IRES firefly were used as
internal controls. Luciferase assays were performed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega E1960) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Circular dichroism and thermal denaturation analysis

Author Manuscript

RNA oligos (see Supplemental Table 5) were used at 10 μM concentration. The buffer used
for GQ studies contained: 40mM KCl, 10mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.050. The buffer
used for salt-free conditions contained: 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The CD
experiments were performed using Aviv 202 CD Spec (DWB 208) spectropolarimeter
equipped with peltier temperature control. For wavelength scan, a range of 320-220 nm was
used with equilibration time of 0.83 sec. Thermal unfolding/folding experiments were
performed across a temperature range of 15°C to 95°C, with a 1°C/minute temperature
gradient. At least five scans each sample were collected and were corrected with respective
buffer controls. Calculations for Tm and deltaG were performed as described in 51.
Smoothing of the CD curves was performed with Prism software by cumulating five
neighboring data points.

Generation of mice

Author Manuscript

The ICN-driven mouse T-ALL model has been reported1,20. Mice were C57BL/6J females
between 6 and 10 weeks of age. Treatment conditions and HPC genotypes were randomized
and non-blinded; n was determined empirically based on previous mouse experiments. Data
were analysed in Kaplan-Meier format using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test for statistical
significance. The surface marker analysis was as described in 1. ShRNAs against Pten52 and
eIF4A156 have been reported. For xenograft studies, 5,000,000 KOPT-K1 cells in 30%
matrigel (BD 354234) were injected subcutaneously into C.B-17 SCID mice. When tumours
were readily visible, the mice were injected on 7 consecutive days with 0.5 mg/kg Silvestrol,
0.2mg/kg (±)-CR-31-B. Tumour size was measured daily by caliper. P-values were
calculated using 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. All animal experiments were performed
in accordance with regulations from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

All Kaplan-Meier curves were analysed using the Mantel-Cox test. The significance of
xenografted tumour size differences was determined using two-way repeated measures
ANOVA tests. RT-PCRs were analysed with two-tailed t-tests. The significance of motif
enrichments was determined using a one-tailed binomial test with correction for differences
in 5′UTR lengths. The p-value for this test is defines as:

where TPos resp. TNeg is the number of genes in the positive resp. negative (background) set,
NPos resp. NNeg is the average length of the 5′UTR of the positive resp. negative set of genes
and HPos resp. HNeg is the number of genes with the motif under consideration and B(n,p)(i)
is the probability for observing i events drawn from the distribution B(n,p)
