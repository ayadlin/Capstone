Oxidation-Mediated DNA Crosslinking Contributes to Toxicity of
6-Thioguanine in Human Cells — Letter
Nanne K.H. de Boer, Dirk P. van Asseldonk, Margien L. Seinen, and Adriaan A. van Bodegraven

With great interest, we read the paper written by Brem and
Karran concerning the unravelling of a novel pathway of
toxicity during 6-thioguanine (6-TG) administration. The thiopurine 6-TG itself acts as a source of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which in combination with incorporated 6-TG nucleotides in DNA leads to cell killing (1). Interestingly, the coadministration of allopurinol protects cells from cytotoxicity by
avoiding a decrease in the protective glutathione concentrations through scavenging of ROS. Whether this implicates that
the concomitant use of allopurinol restrains 6-TG effectiveness
in vivo is unclear.
The conventional thiopurines, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are frequently used for the treatment of malignancies
and immune-mediated inﬂammatory diseases. Their administration on the short term is often limited by the development
of intractable adverse events and ineffectiveness, which in part
is related to a deviant drug metabolism characterized by
elevated concentrations of methylated thiopurine metabolites
[6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP)]. Whether these adverse
events reﬂect an increment in the oxidative stress remains
speculative. Over the past years, the combination of allopurinol

with low-dose azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine has successfully been used to bypass these 6-MMP–associated adverse
events and to increase therapeutic efﬁcacy (2). More speciﬁcally, upon combination therapy, 6-MMP concentrations
decrease drastically, whereas concentrations of the pharmacologically active 6-TG nucleotides increase. Because the
mechanism of this interaction remains largely elusive, it is of
particular interest whether (a reduction of) oxidative stress
may be involved. The long-term administration of thiopurines
is hampered by the risk and fear of developing (secondary)
cancer, like skin cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma (3, 4). The
ROS-mediated cytotoxicity of 6-TG, as shown by Brem and
Karran, may contribute to this carcinogenesis. This may also
hold true for the more frequently used azathioprine and 6mercaptopurine. In their experiments, allopurinol showed
antioxidant properties and protected against DNA damage.
The avoidance of DNA damage by precluding depletion of
glutathione owing to allopurinol coadministration may well
lead to a lowered risk of developing thiopurine therapy–
induced cancer.
In conclusion, allopurinol not only possesses thiopurine
metabolism modulating properties but also ROS scavenging
and subsequently DNA damage preventing properties. Prospective and controlled studies are warranted to further
explore the potential beneﬁcial role of adding allopurinol as
a routine alongside thiopurines.
