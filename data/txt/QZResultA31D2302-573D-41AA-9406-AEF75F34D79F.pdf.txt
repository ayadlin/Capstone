Susceptibility to IFN-α and Drug-Induced Apoptosis

Abstract
Gene products that modify the apoptotic susceptibility of cancer cells may offer novel drug response markers or therapeutic targets. In this study, we probed the contribution of 53 different isopeptidases to apoptosis
triggered by bortezomib and etoposide. USP18, a type I IFN-induced protein that deconjugates the ubiquitinlike modifier ISG15 from target proteins, was found to limit apoptotic susceptibility to IFN-α or bortezomib.
Ablating USP18 in cells treated with IFN-α increased tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) production; upregulated expression of transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)-1, IRF-7, and
IRF-9; and promoted the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The proapoptotic effects of ablating USP18 were
abrogated by FLIP overexpression or TRAIL silencing. However, in bortezomib-treated cells, weak spontaneous signaling from type I IFNs was implicated in the proapoptotic effect of USP18 ablation. Ectopic USP18
repressed apoptotic signaling by IFN-α, TRAIL, or bortezomib. Similar effects were produced by a catalytically
inactive USP18 mutant, indicating that the antiapoptotic function of USP18 is independent of its catalytic
activity. These findings suggest that USP18 may significantly limit operation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
triggered by type I IFN and drugs. Cancer Res; 70(2); 655–65. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Post-translational modification of proteins by covalently
linked ubiquitin (Ub) or Ub-like modifiers (Ubl) is a regulatory mechanism involved in many cellular processes (1). Ub
and Ubl molecules are attached to substrates by isopeptide
linkage generally through the sequential activity of the three
conjugating enzymes E1, E2, and E3 (2). This linkage is reversible and the Ub or the Ubl moieties can be released from
the substrates by deconjugating enzymes belonging to the
isopeptidase family (3).
Several proteins, including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are under the regulation of Ub or Ubl proteins.
Not surprisingly, components of the conjugation-deconjugation
system have become attractive targets for anticancer therapies
(4–10).
Isopeptidase inhibition, in addition to blocking proteasomemediated protein turnover, can alter many Ub-dependent
functions unrelated to protein degradation. These alterations
generate cellular stresses that finally cause cell death. In fact,
nonselective isopeptidase inhibitors can trigger apoptosis in

tumor cells (11–13) and caspase-independent necrotic death
in apoptosis-resistant cells (14).
Isopeptidases can be subdivided in deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) or Ubl-specific proteases (ULP). DUBs and
ULPs deconjugate, respectively, Ub or the other 13 Ubl
molecules from target proteins (1). Genomic studies have
identified 79 human genes encoding for functionally putative DUBs (15) grouped into at least five distinct subfamilies
based on their sequence similarities and mechanisms of
action (3).
To develop more specific isopeptidase inhibitors, it is
important to understand which members of the family
play important roles in the regulation of cell survival
and hence represent reasonable druggable candidates. In
the present study, we have addressed this question by
identifying isopeptidases that can modulate survival in
cancer cells.

bortezomib (0.5 μmol/L; LC Laboratories), etoposide (50 μmol/L;
Sigma), or IFN-α2a (1,000 units/mL; Jena Bioscience). For
trypan blue exclusion assays, 400 cells from three independent samples were counted for each data point.
Plasmid construction and retroviral infection.
pFLAGCMV5-USP18, pcDNA3HA-USP18, and pLPC-USP18
were obtained by standard PCR cloning. The USP18 point
mutant C64S was obtained by in vitro mutagenesis using
the GeneTailor kit (Invitrogen). E1A cells expressing the different transgenes were generated by retroviral infection after
cloning of USP18 wild-type (wt), USP18C64S mutant, or FLIPs
into pLPC retroviral vector, as described previously (16).
Antibody production and immunoblotting. Rabbits were
immunized with recombinant histidine-tagged USP18. The
antiserum was purified against recombinant USP18 fused
to glutathione S-transferase. Immunoblotting was done as
described previously (12, 16). Blots were developed with
SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce).
Small interfering RNA, high-throughput screening, and
caspase activity. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) library
targeting 53 DUBs was obtained from Invitrogen. The
caspase-3/caspase-7 activities were evaluated using the
Apo-ONE Assay (Promega) as described previously (12).
siRNAs were all purchased from Invitrogen.
ELISA. TRAIL and FasL production in cell lysates and
culture supernatants were measured using commercial
ELISA kits (Diaclone Research).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and reporter
gene assays. cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total
RNA using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).
Real-time PCR analyses were done using the SYBR Green
method (primer sequences available on request). Firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured and normalized
for Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the vendor's instructions
(Promega).

Results
RNA interference screen identifies USP18 as a regulator
of the apoptotic susceptibility. To identify isopeptidases
that could be attractive targets for anticancer therapies,
we have set up a screening to score caspase activities induced by anticancer drug treatment in cells silenced to deplete 53 different DUBs. Etoposide and bortezomib were
selected because they elicit different cellular stresses and
also alternative apoptotic pathways (12, 16). E1A cells
were grown in 96-well plates and transfected with the siRNA library against the different DUBs. Each enzyme was
silenced with three different siRNAs independently. Twentyfour hours later, cells were treated with etoposide or bortezomib for 20 hours. DEVDase activity was used as a
readout of caspase activation and apoptosis induction.
Noxa and Apaf-1 silencing was used as a control, respectively, for etoposide- and bortezomib-induced apoptosis
(12, 16).
A typical result of the screening is exemplified in Fig. 1A, in
which the caspase activities of E1A cells silenced with the

656

Cancer Res; 70(2) January 15, 2010

collection of siRNAs (set 2) and treated with bortezomib
are shown. As already published, Apaf-1 silencing does not
influence apoptosis and caspase activity in response to proteasome inhibitors. On the contrary, Noxa downregulation
partially impairs caspase activation.
In summary, this screening revealed that only few isopeptidases significantly influenced etoposide- and/or bortezomibinduced caspase activation. The most powerful siRNAs in
augmenting caspase activation were those specific for
USP18 (Fig. 1A).
Next, we validated the screening by testing the three different siRNAs against USP18 for the ability to sustain caspase activation and promoting cell death in response to
etoposide and bortezomib. Figure 1B shows that at least
two different siRNAs against USP18 strengthened caspase
activity and apoptosis in response to bortezomib as well
as to etoposide.
Depletion of USP18 enhances IFN-induced apoptosis.
USP18 (Ubp43) is an IFN-inducible gene, whose catalytic
activity is specific for the Ubl ISG15, a 15-kDa IFN-induced
protein (17). To study the role of USP18 in controlling apoptosis, an antiserum against USP18 was generated in rabbit.
In contrast to the expected size of 43 kDa, the immunoblot
analysis revealed two bands of approximately 39 and 34 kDa
in E1A cell extracts, in which levels were dramatically
increased after addition of IFN-α (Fig. 2A).
Additional studies (Supplementary Fig. S1) have shown
that the NH2 terminus of UPSP18 is proteolytically processed and that this processing is not generated through
autocleavage (18). In summary, the slow-migrating band
of USP18 corresponds to the full-length protein, whereas
the fast-migrating band represents an NH2-terminal–deleted
derivative of USP18.
The reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) shown in Fig. 2B
confirms that USP18 expression is modulated by IFN-α. It also corroborates that, in E1A cells, USP18 is expressed at low
levels in the absence of exogenously added IFN-α. Next, we
proved that the isolated siRNAs were indeed able to silence
USP18 expression. Figure 2C shows that siRNA2 efficiently
suppresses USP18 expression. siRNA2 was chosen for all
the subsequent experiments.
Given that USP18 is an IFN-inducible gene, we evaluated
its antiapoptotic role in cells challenged with IFN-α alone or
with IFN-α plus bortezomib or etoposide.
Incubation for 24 hours with IFN-α did not induce apoptosis in E1A cells, whereas in cells silenced for USP18
∼25% of the cells were in apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Depletion
of USP18 dramatically augmented apoptosis when etoposide
or bortezomib was added to IFN-α–treated cells. Caspase
activation parallels the appearance of cell death in response
to the different stimuli (Fig. 2D). We confirmed that depletion of USP18 strengthened apoptosis in response to antitumor drugs and IFN-α also in the breast cancer cell line
MCF-7 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
USP18 regulates TRAIL expression and the activation of
the extrinsic pathway in response to IFN-α. Subsequently,
we analyzed the expression levels of various elements of the
apoptotic program in E1A cells silenced for USP18 and treated

USP18 and Apoptosis

Figure 1. RNA interference screen identifies USP18 as a regulator of the apoptotic susceptibility. A, to represent the methodology of the screening
only, results obtained with the plate 2 of the siRNA library are shown. E1A cells were transfected with the different siRNAs specific for the 53 DUBs (plate 2)
or with control, Apaf-1, and Noxa siRNAs. After 20 h, cells were incubated with bortezomib (0.5 μmol/L) and caspase activity was scored 20 h later by
APO-1 assay. Columns, mean (n = 2); bars, SD. Dashed line, the caspase activity of cells transfected with control siRNA and treated with bortezomib
was assumed to be 100. The asterisk marks the siRNA2 for USP18. B, E1A cells were transfected with three different siRNAs specific for USP18 (1, 2, and 3)
or the control siRNA (C) as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated or not, for a further 20 h, with bortezomib or etoposide
before scoring caspase activity and performing trypan blue staining. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

or not with IFN-α. Figure 3A shows the expression levels of
members of the multidomains Bcl-2 family, including the
antiapoptotic Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL and the proapoptotic
Bax and Bak. Mcl-1, Bak, and Bcl-xL levels were weakly
increased on IFN-α treatment and slightly more by the
combination of IFN-α and USP18 silencing. Next, we investigated the amount of the regulative caspase-2, caspase-8,
and caspase-9. Expression levels of caspase-2 were unaffected, whereas its adaptor protein CRADD was weakly
induced and procaspase-9 levels were faintly reduced after
USP18 downregulation in the presence of IFN-α. On the opposite, the expression level of caspase-8 was weakly increased after IFN-α treatment. Moreover, the combination
of USP18 silencing and IFN-α promotes caspase-8 activation,
marked by the appearance of the p43/p41 cleaved forms
and the downregulation of full-length Bid. Having noted
an USP18-dependent caspase-8 activation in response to
IFN-α, we next investigated whether the expression levels
of various elements of the extrinsic pathway were modulated by USP18. FAS/APO-1/CD95, DR4, DR5, FADD, and FLIPL
protein levels were not overtly modulated by USP18 downregulation or by IFN-α treatment (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the
cleaved form of FLIPL was evident only in IFN-α–treated
cells silenced for USP18, thus further confirming the activa-

tion of caspase-8. These observations were corroborated
by the densitometric analysis of the relative immunoblots
(data not shown).
The effect of USP18 downregulation on the levels of death
receptor ligands FASL and TRAIL was then explored (Fig. 3B).
In IFN-treated cells, USP18 downregulation dramatically
promoted TRAIL expression, whereas FASL expression was
not modulated. We were not able to detect changes in TRAIL
expression in cells treated with IFN-α alone or silenced for
USP18 expression in the absence of IFN-α. However, we cannot exclude that these negative results are due to an intrinsic
limit of the assay used for the detection (see below).
To confirm the upregulation of TRAIL expression after
USP18 silencing, we analyzed TRAIL transcripts using
quantitative real-time-PCR. Figure 3C shows that, when
USP18 expression is inhibited, IFN-α potently induces TRAIL
transcripts. With this assay, an upregulation of TRAIL mRNA
can be observed also in control silenced cells treated with
IFN-α. Finally, the dramatic upregulation of TRAIL expression
in IFN-α–treated cells after USP18 silencing was confirmed by
immunoblot in both E1A and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3D).
USP18 modulates TRAIL transcription. To understand
at which level the downregulation of USP18 promotes
the IFN-α–dependent upregulation of TRAIL expression, we

promoter into E1A cells. The TRAIL promoter contains a
GAS-like binding site (−108/−100) and two interferon stimulated response element (ISRE)–binding sites (−1400/−1384 and
−143/−120; refs. 19, 20). The entire human TRAIL promoter
(−1.523) or a shorter fragment (−577), lacking an ISRE-binding
site, was transfected in E1A cells silenced or not for USP18. To
elucidate the contribution of the GAS-like sequence, a signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 reporter luciferase
(pGAS-TA-Luc) was also transfected (Fig. 4A).
The combination of USP18 silencing and IFN-α treatment
powerfully augments transcription from the TRAIL promoter.

As expected, no evident stimulation of the GAS promoter
activity can be observed in cells silenced for USP18 and treated
with IFN-α. Under these experimental conditions, we cannot
discriminate evident effects on the TRAIL promoter in cells
transfected with the control siRNA and treated with IFN-α or
in cells transfected with the USP18 siRNA in the absence of
IFN-α.
mRNA profile studies using cells from USP18/Ubp43−/− mice
indicate that USP18 modulates the expression of many IFN-α–
regulated genes (21). To evaluate the effect of USP18 silencing
on the transcriptional response to IFN-α, we used a promoter
containing repeated ISRE-binding sequences. IFN-α stimulates

transcription from the ISRE promoter and USP18 silencing further dramatically enhances transcription (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, a small but reproducible increase in pISRE transcriptional
activity can be appreciated also in USP18-silenced cells in the
absence of exogenously added IFN (Fig. 4A).
To further understand the genomic changes induced by
USP18 downregulation, we analyzed the mRNA levels for
different transcription factors of the IFN-regulatory factor

www.aacrjournals.org

(IRF) family. IRFs are also involved in the transcriptional
induction of TRAIL in response to IFN-α (20, 22, 23). We
noted a weak induction of IRF-7 (1.6-fold) and IRF-9 (1.4fold) in cells transfected with the siRNA for USP18 compared with the control. On IFN-α addition, USP18 depletion
robustly augments the levels of IRF-1, IRF-7, and IRF-9 and,
at lower levels, of IRF-2 (Fig. 4B). Although the pattern of
IRF upregulation can likewise be observed in cells transfected with the control siRNA and treated with IFN-α, it
can be appreciated that elimination of USP18 seems to have
a stronger effect on the accumulation of IRF-1 rather than
on IRF-9 transcripts.
USP18 can modulate the IFN signaling in a catalysisindependent manner (24). To understand the contribution
of the USP18 deISGylase activity on TRAIL upregulation,
we cotransfected USP18 wt or USP18 C64S catalytically inactive mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1) together with the
ISRE-driven or the TRAIL-driven luciferase reporters in
E1A cells. In the instance of ISRE-derived promoter, cells
were incubated for 24 hours with IFN-α, whereas the treatment
was prolonged for 36 hours in TRAIL promoter-transfected cells.
As illustrated in Fig. 4C, ectopically expressed wt USP18 or C64S
mutant similarly repressed IFN-α–induced transcription
from the ISRE and TRAIL promoters.
To further confirm the ability of USP18 to repress TRAIL
expression, we generated E1A cells stably expressing USP18
wt or its catalytically inactive C64S mutant. Cells expressing
the control gene PURO, USP18 wt, or the C64S mutant were
treated for 24 hours with IFN-α, and immunoblots were
performed to visualize TRAIL induction. USP18 wt and
the C64S mutant similarly repressed TRAIL induction in response to IFN-α (Fig. 4D).
USP18 downregulation promotes apoptosis through
the activation of the extrinsic pathway. To establish the
contribution of TRAIL and the subsequent activation of the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway in the IFN-α–induced death
of USP18-depleted E1A cells, we generated cell lines stably
expressing the short isoform of FLIP (Fig. 5A), a well-known
inhibitor of caspase-8 (25).
In cells expressing FLIPs, the combination of IFN-α treatment and USP18 siRNA was ineffective in promoting apoptosis, thus showing a critical role of the death receptor pathway
(Fig. 5B). Next, we evaluated the contribution of the extrinsic
pathway in the increased apoptotic response to drug treatment of USP18-silenced cells.
Overexpression of FLIPs did not influence drug-induced
apoptosis in E1A cells transfected with the control siRNA.
In contrast, FLIPs almost abolished the increase in druginduced apoptosis elicited by USP18 silencing (Fig. 5C). To
definitively prove the involvement of TRAIL and the activation of the extrinsic pathway, we downregulated TRAIL
expression by siRNA transfection. Supplementary Fig. S3A
shows that TRAIL expression was efficiently inhibited by
the designed siRNA. In cells depleted for TRAIL, the combined treatment with IFN-α and the USP18 siRNA was
unable to elicit apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In addition, the prodeath effect of downregulating USP18 expression during drug-induced apoptosis was entirely dependent

on TRAIL (Fig. 5D). TRAIL silencing weakly influenced etoposide-induced apoptosis.
Sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis by USP18
silencing requires constitutive IFN signaling. In uninfected
cells, there is a constitutive production of IFN-α/β and consequently a weak activation of the IFN pathway (26). In principle, the increased apoptotic response to drugs observed in
cells silenced for USP18 could depend on the constitutive
production of IFN-α/β and the strengthened IFN signaling.
To test this hypothesis, we decided to switch off the consti-

Initially, we analyzed the ability of the siRNA against
IFNAR1 to downregulate IFNR1 expression and to suppress
IFN signaling (Supplementary Fig. S4A–C). Next, we cotransfected E1A cells with two different siRNAs, as indicated
in Fig. 6A. After 24 hours, cells were treated with bortezomib
and cell death was scored 20 hours later.
In the presence of the siRNA against IFNAR1, the susceptibility to bortezomib-induced apoptosis, elicited by USP18

downregulation, was diminished, although not entirely.
Analysis of caspase activities confirmed that USP18 partially
diminishes the capability of augmenting drug-induced
apoptosis when the siRNA against IFNAR1 was added
(Fig. 6B).
To further verify the contribution of the low constitutive
production of type I IFNs, we used an IFNAR2 blocking
antibody. Initially, we tested the ability of IFNAR2 blocking
antibody to inhibit IFN signaling and IFN-induced cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S4D and E).
Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of the anti-IFNAR2
monoclonal antibody (mAb) on the prodeath effect of
USP18 silencing during bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Similarly to the siRNA against IFNAR1, a reproducible but incomplete repressive effect is manifested by the anti-IFNAR2
mAb (Fig. 6C). However, when cells were successively treated with the siRNA against IFNAR1 and the IFNAR2 blocking antibody, a full remission of the prodeath effect of
USP18 siRNA can be observed.
Finally, we also examined the ability of USP18 wt and of
the catalytically inactive mutant to modulate apoptosis in
response to drug treatments. Apoptosis, as induced by bortezomib, was consistently repressed in cells overexpressing
USP18 wt or its catalytic defective mutant C64S (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
USP18 is an IFN-inducible protein, which deconjugates the
Ubl ISG15, another IFN-inducible protein, from target proteins. Rather than degradation, protein ISGylation has important pleiotropic functions in the IFN-mediated antiviral
response (27).
Mice lacking USP18 (Ubp43) accumulate poly-ISGylated
proteins and show a severe phenotype characterized by premature death, brain cell injury, and hydrocephalus (28). This
severe phenotype cannot be rescued by the simultaneous absence of ISG15 (29), thus arguing for catalysis-independent or
ISG15-independent functions of USP18.
An enzymatic-independent activity of USP18 has been described also in the case of the modulation of type I IFN signaling. USP18 acts as a negative regulator of IFN signaling by
competing with Janus-activated kinase (JAK) for the interaction with the IFNAR2 receptor subunit (24). We have confirmed that USP18 downregulation strengthen IFN-α signal
by showing that the induction of different IRFs is increased
in cells with downregulated USP18 levels.
Bone marrow cells from Ubp43−/− mice are highly susceptible to apoptosis on IFN-β stimulation (30). We observed
that USP18 downregulation promotes apoptosis in response
to IFN-α in different cell lines. Expression of FLIPs suppresses the prodeath effect of USP18 downregulation, thus
indicating the involvement of the death receptor/extrinsic
pathway. Caspase-8 activation, Bid, and FLIPL processing further confirm the selective activation of the extrinsic pathway.
We have found that TRAIL levels in response to IFN-α are
dramatically increased in cells lacking USP18 and that TRAIL
is the key factor in the proapoptotic effect of USP18 downregulation.

Although the induction of TRAIL transcription in response to IFNs is a well-established phenomenon (31–34),
the molecular mechanisms and the involved transcription
factors are more debated and possibly differ, depending
on the original signals and the cellular system. Apoptosis
and induction of TRAIL transcription in response to paramyxovirus infection seem to be mediated by IRF3 (20). In a
human bladder cancer cell line, TRAIL upregulation in response to IFN-α requires IRF-1 (23). IRF-1 is also involved
in TRAIL induction by both retinoids and IFN-γ (22).
Interestingly, we have shown that although IRF-1, IRF-7,
and IRF-9 transcript levels increase when IFN-α is accompanied by USP18 downregulation compared with IFN-α
alone, the most prominent effect is manifested by IRF-1,
which is modestly induced by IFN-α alone but nicely induced when also USP18 is depleted.
USP18 and drug-induced apoptosis. Our studies point
out that USP18 plays an important prosurvival role also in
drug-treated cells. Initially, we identified USP18 through a
screening scoring caspase-3/caspase-7 activation in response
to drug treatments. Silencing of USP18 per se does not trigger
apoptosis. A second event (DNA damage or cellular stresses,
induced by the block of protein turnover) is necessary to observe the prosurvival role of USP18.
Also in drug-treated cells, the increased apoptotic response caused by the removal of USP18 largely depends on
the engagement of the extrinsic pathway. In fact, FLIP overexpression or TRAIL silencing can suppress the proapoptotic
effect of the USP18 siRNA.
Activation of the extrinsic pathway by USP18 silencing
is insufficient to elicit apoptosis in drug-treated cells with
alterations in the mitochondrial pathway. However, addition of IFN-α in combination with drugs restores apoptosis
even in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 and mutated for caspase-9 (Supplementary Fig. S5). This behavior resembles
those of type I cells, where the amount of active caspase-8 generated on death receptor ligation at the death
inducing signal complex is sufficient to directly activate
caspase-3 (35). Hence, it is possible that the dramatic
induction of TRAIL, when IFN-α is provided to USP18depleted cells, allows a robust caspase-8 and caspase-3
activation, which can kill cells without the help of
mitochondria.
We have also shown that for bortezomib-induced apoptosis, the proapoptotic effect of the siRNA against USP18
depends on the IFN signaling. The simultaneous downregulation of the IFNAR1 and the presence of blocking mAb for
IFNAR2 fully suppress the proapoptotic effect of USP18
silencing in drug-treated cells. This result shows that the
weak spontaneous IFN-α/β signal, which occurs in many
cell types (26), is required for the proapoptotic effect of
USP18 silencing. Within this respect, it has been recently
shown that, in a mouse model, USP18/Ubp43 absence improves the resistance to oncogenic transformation by BCRABL. This resistance to leukemic development is dependent
on type I IFN signaling (36).
Is the elimination of USP18 enough to augment the weak
spontaneous IFN-α/β signal? When the transcriptional

activity from pISRE reporter was analyzed, a modest but
reproducible increase in transcription was observed in
USP18-silenced cells compared with control in the absence
of IFN-α. Similarly, this weak activation was observed when
the levels of IRF-7 and IRF-9 mRNAs were investigated. However, we were unable to detect an induction of TRAIL when
USP18 silencing was performed in the absence of IFN-α. Previous studies have similarly failed to observe an increase in
TRAIL transcripts in macrophages from Ubp43−/− mice compared with wt, although the expression of some IFN-inducible
genes was increased (21). Hence, it is possible that additional
mechanisms, unrelated to the control of TRAIL transcript levels, operate to activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Finally, it should be taken into account that, in addition to the
IFN signaling, USP18 could be involved in the regulation of
other signaling pathways (37). USP18-repressive influence on
IFN signaling is independent from the deISGylase activity (24).
Similarly, we have shown that the USP18 antiapoptotic activity, during bortezomib-induced apoptosis, and its repression
of TRAIL transcription, in response to IFN-α, are independent
from its catalytic activity. Hence, our data favor the model
proposed by the group of Zhang, where USP18 competes with
JAK for IFNAR2 binding. However, further studies will be
necessary to clarify if USP18 can bind and modulate additional proteins.

In conclusion, our studies indicate that targeting USP18
could be an important tool to boost the antiproliferative effects of the IFNs.
