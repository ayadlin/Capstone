BACKGROUND. This study was conducted to develop a brief measure of fatigue
and functional impact in cancer patients with anemia.

METHODS. Data were obtained from a multisite, phase 2 study of darbepoetin-a
(n 5 1558). Eligible patients were 18 years with nonmyeloid malignancies and
anemia (hemoglobin 11 g/dL) who were receiving chemotherapy. Items from the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), Brief Fatigue
Inventory (BFI), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and items adapted from the
Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 physical functioning scale were evaluated for inclusion in the measure. Items were selected by identifying the best predictors of total
FACT-F scores, hemoglobin, and adjusted maximum oxygen uptake (VO2Max) in

RESULTS. Data from 401 patients with complete data were used to identify 8

FFIS also correlated substantially with single-item measures of energy (r 5 0.75)
and productivity (r 5 0.72).

CONCLUSIONS. The FFIS is a reliable, brief, and practical tool that is potentially
suitable for identifying fatigue and functional impact in cancer patients. Cancer

Fatigue and Functional Impact Scale/Cella et al

in people with cancer, with a prevalence in the range
of 60% to 95%.7 It can be more debilitating than other
symptoms
or
treatment-related
complications.8
Increased fatigue levels have been found to correlate
with impairment in structured motor performance
tasks, including the 6-minute walk.9 Early identification
and treatment of fatigue is enabled by clinical tools
drawn from research over the past decade10-13 and
best practice guidelines drawn from the available
literature (available at: http://www.nccn.org/ accessed
on July 10, 2008). However, despite the evidence, fatigue often goes undetected or unreported in routine
clinical practice.14,15 Patients sometimes fail to discuss
their fatigue symptoms with physicians, and physicians
may fail to adequately assess these symptoms.14,16
The first section of the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems fatigue assessment tool (P-ICD10) in cancer
has been proposed as a means of detecting clinically
significant fatigue.17 However, this approach has not
been correlated with measures of functional impairment. Several approaches have been used to measure
self-reported fatigue, ranging from the use of a single
item,18 to the development of multi-item instruments
such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) score,19 the Piper Fatigue
Scale,20 and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory
(MFI).21 These multi-item instruments are comprehensive, but their length may be a barrier to clinical
use. A shortened tool that detects clinically meaningful fatigue may be more practical for use in clinical
practice and beneficial to patient care. It is essential
that patient-reported assessments used in clinical
practice be easily administered as well as reliable
and valid.22 The objective of this study was to develop a brief and valid measure of fatigue and functional impairment in cancer patients with anemia
who were receiving chemotherapy, using both selfreported and performance-based measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility and Randomization
Data were obtained from a multisite, open-label,
noncomparative phase 2 study of darbepoetin-a
administered at a starting dosage of 3 lg/kg every 2
weeks for up to 8 doses.23 Eligible patients were aged
18 years, were receiving cyclic chemotherapy for
nonmyeloid malignancies, and were anemic, as
determined by hemoglobin 11 g/dL during screening. Patients were scheduled to receive at least an
additional 8 weeks of cyclic chemotherapy. Eligibility
also required adequate renal and hepatic function,
adequate iron stores (transferrin at 15% and/or

1481

ferritin 10 ng/mL), and no evidence of nutritional
anemia. Patients were enrolled between September
2001 and January 2003.
All patients received the FACT-F and, to minimize redundancy and patient burden, were randomly
assigned (1:1) to complete either the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) plus a single item, ‘‘Unusually tired or
fatigued in the last week,’’ or to complete the Fatigue
Symptom Inventory (FSI). All study procedures were
approved by the Institutional Review Board of each
center and all subjects provided informed consent
before data collection.

Study Variables
Performance-based measures
The Modified Harvard Step Test (MHST) was administered at Weeks 1 (baseline), 9, and 17 (end of
study) to assess functional capacity based on a published nomogram for calculation of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2Max).24 Each of the 3 stages of the
MHST required 3 minutes of continuous exercise at a
predetermined speed, followed by measurement of
the exercise heart rate. Additional elements needed
to estimate VO2Max such as weight, age, and sex
were collected. To assess anemia, hemoglobin was
monitored every 2 weeks during the treatment phase.
Self-reported measures
Self-reported fatigue and physical functioning measures were administered at Weeks 1 (baseline), 9, and
17 (end of study). All patients completed the 13-item
FACT-F,19 and questions from either the BFI25 or the
FSI,11 as randomized. All patients also responded to
5 questions from the Medical Outcomes Study
(MOS) SF-36 physical functioning scale adapted to
have values ranging from 0 (Not limited at all) to 10
(Very limited).26 The 5 items were ‘‘Limited climbing
several flights of stairs,’’ ‘‘Limited climbing 1 flight of
stairs,’’ ‘‘Limited walking more than 1 mile,’’ ‘‘Limited
walking several blocks,’’ and ‘‘Limited walking 1
block.’’ Higher scores indicated better health status
for these measures.
All patients also answered 1 question each
regarding energy and productivity. Energy was measured with a single item, ‘‘How much energy have you
had during the past 4 weeks?’’ with possible values
from 0 (No energy at all) to 10 (A great deal of
energy). Patients were asked to rate their productivity
using a single item, ‘‘Rate your productivity or effectiveness in your work or daily activities during the
past 4 weeks.’’ Response options for the productivity
measure ranged from 0 (No productivity or no effectiveness) to 10 (Best possible productivity or effectiveness).

At the MHST assessments, physical exertion was
measured on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion
(RPE), with response values ranging from 6, suggesting ‘‘No exertion,’’ to 20, suggesting ‘‘Extremely strenuous exercise.’’27 Clinicians recorded the patient’s
status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance measure consisting of 5 levels
ranging from 0 (Fully active) to 5 (Dead).28

Statistical Analysis
Fatigue and physical functioning items from different
scales were transformed to a possible range of 0 to
100, with higher scores indicating better health. To
select items, data were analyzed using a scale development sample of 401 patients who had baseline
hemoglobin, baseline FACT-F, at least 1 follow-up
hemoglobin measurement, and who completed 3
minutes of 1 stages of the MHST. The scale development sample included 12 patients who did not have a
follow-up FACT-F. Analyses were conducted separately for patients randomized to the FSI group and
those randomized to the BFI group. To identify candidates for inclusion in the new measure, items from
the FACT-F, MOS, BFI, and FSI were evaluated using
linear regression and the RSQUARE selection method
in the SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) REG procedure to
determine the best combinations of predictors of the
total FACT-F score, the adjusted VO2Max, and hemoglobin, based on pooled data from all 3 assessments
(baseline, Week 9, and Week 17). The best predictors
were identified based on r-squared values.
Final item selection was guided by how well the
change in candidate variables over time predicted
change in the total FACT-F, change in measures of
adjusted VO2Max, and change in hemoglobin over
time. The final measure was comprised of items
identified from regression models using the entire
scale development sample, and also identified separately in the groups randomized to either the FSI or
BFI (because patients in the BFI group had missing
values for FSI items and vice versa).
Evaluation of the new measure was conducted
using an assessment sample consisting of the 1355
patients from the source study who had a baseline
and at least 1 follow-up FACT-F assessment. The
number of patients used in each analysis varies by
the number of completed responses obtained for
that particular item(s). Scale internal consistency was
estimated using Cronbach coefficient alpha. Pearson
correlation coefficients were estimated between
scores obtained from the new measure and the following variables: hemoglobin levels, exercise capacity
(adjusted VO2Max), FACT-F, BFI, FSI, perceived exertion, energy, productivity, and performance status

(measured using the ECOG instrument). Change
between baseline and Week 9 was calculated for
hemoglobin and exercise capacity as well as the selfreported measures, and correlations between change
scores were examined. Correlations were calculated
between scale scores and the full instruments from
which the items were selected, and between scale
scores and theoretically related constructs (adjusted
VO2Max, hemoglobin, ECOG performance status,
self-reported energy, and productivity). In addition,
bifactor analysis26 was used to assess whether the
final FFIS was sufficiently unidimensional.
In addition to the correlations, the newly created
measure was compared with other measures of fatigue and functional capacity by gauging how well
each scale or group of items predicted predefined
outcomes that were recoded to a binary (Yes/No)
response. Outcomes of interest included VO2Max,
exercise heart rate, and Borg scale (RPE), all measured at the time of the MHST if the MHST was
performed within 3 days of the patient self-report.
Energy, productivity, and ECOG performance status
were measured at the time of the patient self-report.
Hemoglobin was as measured up to 3 days before
the patient self-report. In addition, 2 variables (Completed MHST’’ and ‘‘Attempted MHST) were defined
to capture MHST performance. The MHST was considered completed if it had a duration of 180 seconds
and was completed within 3 days of the patient selfreport (it was considered attempted if performed
within 3 days of the patient self-report and the duration was <180 seconds).
The cutpoints were based on the percentile distribution of values of each outcome for cross-sectional variables. For example, if a cutpoint of 40 was
selected based on the distribution of the variable, we
created a binary value of 1 if 40, and 0 if <40. In
the case of longitudinal variables measuring change
over time, the cutpoints were based on the distribution of each change score. Zero was always 1 of the
cutpoints for change scores because it is always of
interest. Additional cutpoints were selected to be
round numbers that still included a reasonable fraction of the cases both above and below the cutpoint.
Comparison among measures was based on calculating the area under the receiver-operator curve (ROC),
the C-index, of each scale for each outcome. Higher
values are better, with a value of 1.0 representing
perfection (the instrument is able to perfectly predict
the outcome) and a value of 0.5, indicating that the
instrument is performing only about as well as one
would expect by chance.
To approximate the scores expected if both the
BFI and FSI had been collected, sensitivity analyses

were conducted whereby missing values for the single BFI and FSI items selected for inclusion in the
tool were imputed based on regression models using
the global FACT-F, energy, productivity, ECOG performance, perceived exertion, adjusted VO2Max, and
hemoglobin as independent variables.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 1588 patients from 219 participating community oncology practices who met eligibility criteria
were enrolled in the trial. The scale development
sample of 401 patients was used for the item selection process and the assessment sample of 1355
patients was used for the assessment of the newly
developed measure. Sociodemographic characteristics of these samples are summarized in Table 1. The
patients averaged 60 years of age, and the majority
of the patients were white (81%) and female (68%).
Item Selection
Based on examination of the predictors of the global
FACT-F scores, VO2Max, and hemoglobin, 6 items

1483

from the FACT-F, 4 items from the MOS, 4 items
from the BFI, and 3 from the FSI were identified as
the best predictors. These 17 items were included in
final item selection, which was based on changes
over time.

Predictors of change in FACT-F scores over time
In subgroup analyses based on the entire scale development sample and on the BFI and FSI subsamples,
3 items that were found to consistently predict the
change in FACT-F scores over time were, ‘‘I have
trouble starting things because I am tired,’’ ‘‘I must
limit social activity because I am tired,’’ and ‘‘I feel
weak all over’’ from the FACT-F that explained 83%
to 85% variance in change in FACT-F scores over
time. The R2 obtained from the model increased
from 86% to 88% with the addition of a fourth item,
‘‘I feel tired,’’ from the FACT-F (Multiple R 5 0.933).
The addition of a fifth item increased the variance
explained to 89%.
Predictors of change in VO2Max over time
Items that consistently predicted change in VO2Max
over time were ‘‘I feel fatigued’’ and ‘‘I feel listless
(washed out)’’ from the FACT-F, ‘‘Limited climbing
several flights of stairs’’ and ‘‘Limited walking 1
block’’ from the MOS (Multiple R 5 0.229). The addition of a single item, ‘‘What is your level of fatigue
on average?’’ from the FSI increased the variance
explained from 15% to 21%. The best additional predictor from the BFI, ‘‘How much has fatigue interfered with your relationship with other people?’’
increased the variance explained from 21% to 24%.
Dropping the single item predictors from the BFI
and FSI substantially reduced the amount of variance
explained.
Predictors of change in hemoglobin over time
In the combined group of patients, best predictors of
change in hemoglobin were ‘‘Limited climbing several flights of stairs,’’ ‘‘Limited climbing 1 flight of
stairs,’’ from the MOS and ‘‘I feel weak all over’’ from
the FACT-F (Multiple R 5 0.268). In the FSI subgroup, the addition of a fourth item, ‘‘Rate how
much, in the past week, fatigue interfered with your
mood’’ from the FSI improved the variance explained
in change in hemoglobin from 13% to 14%. Prediction of change in hemoglobin over time was markedly poorer in the BFI group.
Based on the above regression results, a set of 6
core items consisting of 4 items from the FACT-F and
2 from the MOS were identified for inclusion in the
FFIS. In addition, a single item from the BFI, ‘‘How
much has fatigue interfered with your relationship

in the FFIS in the subset of patients taking the BFI.
Similarly, an additional item from the FSI, ‘‘What is
your level of fatigue on average?’’ was identified in
the subset of patients taking the FSI. The items,
means, and range for each item in the FFIS are
shown in Table 2.

Psychometric Properties
Using the assessment sample, we examined the internal consistency reliability of the FFIS separately in
the BFI and FSI subsamples, pooled across assessments. The Cronbach coefficient alpha was .91 in the
BFI subsample and .90 in the FSI subsample, and
corrected item-to-scale correlations for the items
ranged from .66 to .79 except that the FSI item correlated .62 with the rest of the scale. Because we were
concerned that the 2 stair-climbing items from the
MOS physical functioning scale might represent a
different domain than the other 6 items, we performed a bifactor analysis to address this question.
We found that the 2 stair-climbing items had high
loadings on the general factor, but those items also
shared noteworthy bivariate association beyond their
correlation with the other items in the FFIS (ie, item
dependency). Forming subscales from the 4 FACT
items, the 2 stair-climbing items, and the BFI or FSI
item resulted in pairwise correlations among the
subscales of .60 to .69. We also checked for item dependency between the 2 items on social functioning,
but it was not different from among other pairs of
items. We elected not to adjust the scoring algorithm
to accommodate the identified item dependency to
preserve the simplicity of the FFIS.
Correlations between FFIS scores and other selfreported measures and functional capacity are shown
in Table 3. Correlations between FFIS scores and
related concepts, such as self-reported energy and

productivity, are high, thereby providing evidence of
construct validity. The correlations between change
scores for the FFIS and change scores for other selfreport measures were nearly as high. However, the
correlations between FFIS scores and objective measures (including hemoglobin) were more modest
(magnitude of 0.24 to 0.38 for data at a single point
in time and 0.16 to 0.20 for change scores). Adjusted
VO2Max was not found to be correlated with FFIS
scores.

ROC Analysis
Tables 4 and 5 show the ROC analysis for the longitudinal change scores from baseline to Week 9. In
each table, the columns detail the alternative instruments; the last column details the 1 item from the
BFI that is in the FFIS (Table 4) or the 1 item from
the FSI that is in the FFIS (Table 5). The rows in
each table represent the alternative criteria (outcomes), namely, the various measures that the new
measure should predict. Multiple alternative cutpoints are given because to our knowledge no universally accepted cutpoint is available for these
outcomes. For the FFIS column, the entries are the
area under the ROC curve for that instrument and
that outcome, otherwise known as the C-index. For
the other columns, the entry in the table is the deviation in the C-index for that measure relative to the
FFIS. A positive value indicates that the measure performs better than the FFIS for that outcome and a
negative value indicates that the measure performs
worse than the FFIS for that outcome. An instrument
with better sensitivity for a given specificity, or better
specificity for a given sensitivity, would have a higher
C-index. The FFIS performs well in the change score
analysis. This is especially important for evaluating
improvement in functional capacity from the change
in the self-reported scale.

The FFIS column shows the C-index (area under the ROC curve) for that instrument and that outcome and the subsequent columns show the deviation in the C-index for that measurement relative to the FFIS.

Analysis of Imputed Values
No patient has data for all 8 items of the FFIS
because no patient completed both the BFI and FSI.
We imputed the missing score using regression and
compared that with the score obtained by averaging
the available items. The correlation between the
imputed score and the score obtained by averaging
the available items was 0.998. The imputed score
gave very similar results in ROC analyses.

DISCUSSION
The FFIS, an 8-item instrument, was derived from
existing self-reported measures,11,19,25,26 and has
potential for use as a short measure to identify fatigue
and functional impairment in anemic patients receiving chemotherapy. Items were selected for potential
inclusion based on their ability to predict hemoglobin, functional capacity measured by adjusted
VO2Max, and global FACT-F scores; final item selection considered change in hemoglobin, adjusted
VO2Max, and global FACT-F scores over time.

The FFIS performed nearly as well as, or better
than, the full versions of the fatigue measures from
which it was derived. The validity of the FFIS was
confirmed by high correlations between FFIS scores
and self-reported energy and productivity scores, as
well as by correlations found with other measures of
patient-reported fatigue. It is not surprising that the
FFIS correlates well with the FACT-F given that the
global FACT-F score was used as an outcome variable
in item selection, but that does not diminish the utility of this shortened instrument. Correlations with
hemoglobin and change in hemoglobin were modest
but not unexpectedly so. We also found that FFIS
scores were not significantly correlated with change
in adjusted VO2Max over time. It is possible that
decreased adjusted VO2Max may indicate difficulty
performing daily activities without actually experiencing fatigue.
The FFIS involves less respondent burden
because it is shorter than existing multi-item fatigue
measures.19-21,25,29 The instrument is easy to score
and expected to require 2 to 3 minutes to complete.

Fatigue and Functional Impact Scale/Cella et al

The inclusion of 2 items adapted from the physical
functioning subscale of the MOS added an easyto-understand activity component that assessed
functional impairment (limitations in climbing stairs)
beyond the general symptoms of fatigue alone. The
brevity and ease of use of the FFIS suggests that the
instrument may be suitable for the assessment of
anemia-related functional capacity deficits in clinical
practice. Furthermore, because the FFIS was developed based on patients with various tumor types, the
results can be considered generalizable to a range of
cancer patients.
The study from which the data to develop the
FFIS was obtained had some limitations. The administration of the MHST was not consistent across
study sites and the completion rate among patients
of even the first stage of the MHST was poor. The
scale development sample, which required at least 1
stage of the MHST to be completed, included only
approximately 25% of the patients (401 of 1588) and
was biased toward patients with better functional
capacity. The analysis was limited to patients who
had completed the MHST test and may have
excluded patients with more impaired physical functioning. The small size of the scale development
sample meant that we had diminished ability to
examine correlations between patient self-report
questions and adjusted VO2Max. Another limitation
of the study was that patients were randomized to
receive either the BFI or the FSI, so no patient
received all 8 FFIS items, although this was not
found to impact FFIS scores. In addition, the timing
of the MHST and the PRO measures was not standardized and the assessments could have been up to 3
days apart.
Despite consisting of only 8 items, the FFIS
addresses issues related to limitations in social activities and interference in relationships with others,
although there are some aspects of fatigue that it
does not capture. In addition, the physical components of functioning are limited to climbing stairs,
which focuses on the lower extremities. However, Lai
et al30,31 found that fatigue was sufficiently unidimensional to render it suitable for applications such
as item response theory that require unidimensionality. This finding was based on a bifactor analysis
conducted using data from a study of 555 cancer
patients who were administered a 72-item fatigue
bank covering a range of fatigue-related concerns
including intensity, frequency, and interference with
physical, mental, and social activities.31 The FFIS
may not be as responsive to change in fatigue as
more comprehensive measures of fatigue.19,20 However, longer multidimensional instruments are asso-

1487

ciated with more respondent burden, which can be
an issue in repeated administrations with patients
already fatigued as a result of disease progression
or chemotherapy. The respondent burden associated
with completing the 8-item FFIS is expected to be
minimal because of the brevity and ease of completion of the scale.
The FFIS may be valuable as a tool to identify
patients with fatigue and functional impairment who
can be evaluated further to identify the underlying
causes of fatigue and potential interventions. Screening tools in office-based practice have been found to
result in improved detection of problems and earlier
treatment.32,33 It is possible that implementation of
the FFIS may result in improved identification of fatigue and functional impairment in cancer patients
with anemia and lead to better management of such
symptoms. Screening tools that are brief can be
easier to use in routine clinical practice. The PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Network, part of the National Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative, has initiated the
formation of item banks, including the development
of a short-form measure of fatigue impact and experience.34 Future research is required to evaluate the
performance of the FFIS as a stand-alone instrument
in longitudinal studies and in comparison with the
PROMIS fatigue measure in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. Examining the relation between
hemoglobin change and improvement in FFIS scores
in the context of response to anemia treatment will
be of value. Although some research has been conducted regarding the correlation between patient
self-reports and observed performance measures,9
this remains an important topic for additional
research using the FFIS. It would be especially valuable to describe the correlation between the FFIS and
performance indicators of fatigue and physical functioning that do not focus primarily on the lower
extremities. Further research using in-depth qualitative patient interviews may be helpful to evaluate
content validity and better understand the concept
of fatigue in this patient population and the impact
of fatigue on patients’ daily lives.
The initial findings suggest that the FFIS has
good psychometric properties and it is expected to
be quick and easy to use. Future studies are needed
to further evaluate the FFIS in different populations
of patients with cancer. The development of a simpler format with standardized response categories
and further evaluation in longitudinal clinical studies
with more established scales may be useful. Examination of the sensitivity and specificity of the FFIS
and the feasibility of incorporating the instrument in

clinical practice is needed. It will be essential to
examine the effectiveness of using the FFIS in future
research and study the associated impact on patient
outcomes.
