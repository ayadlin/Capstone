ABSTRACT
Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancer tends
to be aggressive, highly metastatic, and drug resistant and spreads rapidly. Studies
have indicated that emodin inhibits HER-2 expression. This study compared the HER2-inhibitory effects of two compounds extracted from rhubarb roots: aloe-emodin (AE)
and rhein. Our results indicated that AE exerted the most potent inhibitory effect on
HER-2 expression. Treatment of HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells with AE
reduced tumor initiation, cell migration, and cell invasion. AE was able to suppress
YB-1 expression, further suppressing downstream HER-2 expression. AE suppressed
YB-1 expression through the inhibition of Twist in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells. Our data also found that AE inhibited cancer metastasis and cancer stem cells
through the inhibition of EMT. Interestingly, AE suppressed YB-1 expression through
the downregulation of the intracellular integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/protein kinase B
(Akt)/mTOR signaling pathway in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. In vivo
study showed the positive result of antitumor activity of AE in nude mice injected with
human HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings suggest the possible
application of AE in the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

and is highly metastatic as well as drug resistant [3].
Clinically, Herceptin is the most common treatment [4];
however, some patients exhibit drug resistance within
1 year of treatment [5]. Therefore, overcoming drug
resistance and establishing more effective treatment
options for patients with HER-2 overexpression is
crucial [6].

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among
women worldwide [1]. Among the clinical classifications
of breast cancer [2], human epidermal growth factor
receptor-2 (HER-2)-overexpressing breast cancer has a
high risk of treatment failure because it spreads rapidly

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key
event in cancer metastasis [7]. Tumor hypoxia results
in the high expression of hypoxia-inducible factors
(HIFs), thereby inducing EMT [8]. After EMT induction,
the transcription factors Snail or Twist suppresses the
intercellular binding protein E-cadherin, reducing binding
between cancer cells and generating highly aggressive and
mobile cancer cells; this promotes the departure of cancer
cells from the primary tumor, leading to tumor metastasis
[9]. EMT can induce the generation of cancer cells with
stem cell characteristics [10], and cancer stem cells are one
of the most crucial factors in cancer recurrence, metastasis,
and drug resistance [11].
Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a multifunctional
protein involved in transcription and translation; high
YB-1 expression promotes cell proliferation and inhibits
apoptosis, tumor invasion and metastasis, and angiogenesis
[12]. Studies have found that YB-1 can promote breast
cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, and progression and
metastasis of other cancers [13] through EMT regulation.
YB-1 expression, which has been detected in many cancers,
promotes stem cell expression, improves mobility of cancer
cells, and enhances expression of genes associated with
drug resistance and other common characteristics of cancer
stem cells [14–16].
Anthraquinones are a large group of natural aromatic
compounds [17]. Such compounds are historically used
as natural dyes, but recent studies demonstrated their
medicinal values such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory,
antiviral, anticancer, and antiaging properties [18]. The
anthraquinone emodin inhibits the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells [19] and induces
apoptosis of cancer cells [20]. However, it is not known
whether other anthraquinones, such as aloe-emodin (AE)
and rhein, would suppress the proliferation of HER-2overexpressing breast cancer cells. This study revealed
that anthraquinones suppressed HER-2-overexpressing
breast cancer cell proliferation; furthermore, the molecular
changes during cell program death were explored.

h (Figure 1B). Immunofluorescence staining yielded similar
results (Figure 1C). In a cell viability test, AE suppressed
HER-2 expression in HER-2-overexpressing SkBr3 cell
line (Figure 1D). In the soft agar assay, AE reduced the
number of cells (Figure 1E). In the colony formation
assay, AE had the highest inhibitory effect on the number
of colonies, compared with emodin and rhein (Figure 1F).
These findings showed that among anthraquinones, AE had
the most significant suppressive effect on HER-2 expression
and cell proliferation in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we treated
SkBr3 cells with different concentrations of AE (10, 20,
and 40 μM) and observed the variation in the suppression
of HER-2 expression. The Western blotting results showed
that increasing AE therapeutic concentrations significantly
and dose-dependently suppressed HER-2 expression
(Figure 1G). Immunofluorescence staining also yielded
similar results (Figure 1H). These results showed that
compared with emodin and rhein, AE significantly
suppressed HER-2 expression in HER-2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells.

AE specifically suppressed cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis in HER-2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells
Among members of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (HER, ErbB) family, HER-2 is the most potent
oncogenic protein and positively correlates with the
metastasis of cancer cells [22]. We next investigated
whether AE specifically suppressed the proliferation of
HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We used the
MTT assay to examine the cell viability of different cell
lines, including the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC), HER-2-overexpressing,
and normal breast cell line, MCF-10A. After treatment with
different concentrations of AE for 48 h, the results indicated
that AE specifically suppressed the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing cells (Figure 2A). The colony formation
test also revealed the same result (Figure 2B). Furthermore,
ER-positive and triple-negative breast cancer cells were
transfected with HER2 to determine whether AE specifically
suppresses the proliferation of HER-2-overexpressing cells.
We used Western blotting to verify HER-2 overexpression
in ER-overexpressing and triple-negative breast cancer cell
lines (data not shown); moreover, we used the MTT test
to compare cell transfection in HER-2-overexpressing and
HER-2-non-overexpressing cell lines. We found that as the
AE concentration increased, cell proliferation in the HER2-overexpressing cell line decreased (Figure 2C). Moreover,
the colony formation test yielded similar results (Figure 2D).
The MTT assay revealed that AE treatment at different time
points suppressed cell viability in SkBr3 cells (24 h, IC50 =
152.88 μM; 48 h, IC50 = 27.56 μM, 72 h, IC50 = 16.72 μM)
(Figure 2E). The soft agar test showed that treatment with

RESULTS
Anthraquinone derivatives suppressed HER-2
expression and cell proliferation in HER-2overexpressing breast cancer cells
Studies have demonstrated that emodin, an
anthraquinone compound, has antitumor effects in breast
cancer [21]. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects
of three anthraquinones, emodin, AE, and rhein, (Figure 1A)
on HER-2 expression in HER-2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells. Among these three anthraquinones, AE had
the highest inhibitory effect on HER-2 expression in SkBr3,
BT-474, and MDA-MB-453 cell lines when they were treated
with these compounds at a concentration of 40 μM for 48

increasing concentrations of AE significantly reduced the
number of colonies in SkBr3 cells (Figure 2F). In the colony
formation assay, AE significantly reduced the number of
colonies in SkBr3 cells (Figure 2G). Through Annexin V–PI
double staining, we determined that AE induced apoptosis
in SkBr3 cells (Figure 2H). In addition, we determined the
effect of AE on cell cycle arrest in HER-2-overexpressing
cells through flow cytometry. These results indicated that
AE treatment for 48 h significantly induced sub-G1 cell
cycle arrest in SkBr3 cells (Figure 2I). When cells undergo
apoptosis, PARP in the nucleus is cleaved to form cleaved
PARP. This study observed that treatment with increasing
concentrations of AE significantly increased cleaved
PARP (Figure 2J). It showed that AE treatment specifically
suppressed proliferation of HER-2-overexpressing cells by
inducing apoptosis.

AE suppressed YB-1 expression in SkBr3 cells
A clinical study showed that YB-1 overexpression
was detected in patients with HER-2 overexpression
[23], and it also promoted cell proliferation, tumor
metastasis, invasion and angiogenesis [24]. In this study,
we determined whether AE suppressed YB-1 expression in
HER-2-overexpressing cell lines. The results showed that
increasing concentrations of AE more strongly suppressed
YB-1 expression (Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained
through immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3B).
Moreover, we determined whether AE reduced YB-1
expression through transcription. We used qRT-PCR to
observe mRNA levels. Our results showed that increasing
concentrations of AE significantly increased the suppression
of YB-1 mRNA levels. The results confirmed that AE
suppressed YB-1 during transcription, which resulted in
lower protein expression (Figure 3C). We next used siRNA
to examine whether silencing of YB-1 expression affected
HER-2 expression. The results showed that silencing
YB-1 expression reduced HER-2 expression. Interestingly,
silencing YB-1 expression and treating with AE suppressed
HER-2 expression (Figure 3D). These results showed that
in HER-2-overexpressing cell lines, suppression of YB-1
expression by AE further suppressed downstream HER-2
expression.

AE downregulated Twist expression in SkBr3
cells
Studies have indicated that Twist regulates YB-1
expression and both Twist and YB-1 promote malignant
potentials, including tumor growth, invasion and anticancer-drug resistance [25, 26]. We next determined whether
AE suppressed YB-1 expression through the inhibition of
Twist in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Western
blot results showed that increasing concentrations of AE
significantly inhibited Twist expression (Figure 4A), and
immunofluorescence staining yielded similar results (Figure
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

4B). We used qRT-PCR to investigate whether Twist mRNA
levels changed after AE treatment. The results showed that
increasing concentrations of AE significantly inhibited Twist
mRNA levels (Figure 4C) and that AE treatment significantly
inhibited the oncogenic transcription factor Twist through
transcription. Our data indicated that treatment with AE
suppressed YB-1 expression through the inhibition of Twist
in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.

AE inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition
in SkBr3 cells
Twist has been demonstrated to be a major regulator
of EMT [27]. We evaluated whether AE inhibited EMT
and cancer metastasis in HER-2-overexpressing cell
lines. Our results showed that increasing concentrations
of AE significantly restored the epithelial cell adhesion
protein E-cadherin and suppressed vimentin expression, a
mesenchymal cell marker. MDA-MB-231, which is a highly
metastatic TNBC cell line, was used as the mesenchymal
cell control (Figure 5A). Immunofluorescence staining of
HER-2-overexpressing cell lines after AE treatment revealed
significantly increased E-cadherin expression (Figure 5B).
Interestingly, treatment of HER-2-overexpressing cell
lines with AE significantly reduced the cancer metastasis
transcription factors Snail, Slug, Twist, and HIF-1α
expression in a dose- (Figure 5C) and time-dependent
(Supplementary Figure 1) manner. Malignant cells
produce proteolytic enzymes, including serine proteinase,
cathepsins, metalloproteinases (MMPs), and heparanase,
among which MMP-9 and MMP-2 play key roles in
destroying the basement membrane for mediating cancer
invasion and metastasis [28]. The gelatin zymography assay
confirmed that increasing concentrations of AE significantly
reduced the activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in HER-2overexpressing cell lines (Figure 5D). The Transwells assay
showed that treatment of HER-2-overexpressing cells with
increasing concentrations of AE significantly inhibited the
cancer cell migration (Figure 5E) and invasion (Figure 5F)
rates. We determined whether AE treatment of HER-2overexpressing cancer cells inhibited cancer stem cells. The
results showed that treatment of HER-2-overexpressing cells
with increasing concentrations of AE significantly inhibited
the number of mammosphere formation (Figure 5G) and
the size of mammosphere formed (Figure 5H). Therefore,
we concluded that AE inhibited EMT involved in cancer
metastasis and cancer stem cells.

AE inhibited ILK signaling pathways in SkBr3
cells
A study has indicated that altering the intracellular
integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/protein kinase B (Akt)/
mTOR signaling pathway regulated YB-1 expression and/
or cellular localization [29]. We next observed whether
AE treatment inhibited the expression of ILK. The results

showed that increasing concentrations of AE reduced
ILK and phosphorylation of ILK at threonine 173 protein
expression (Figure 6A). Next, the ILK inhibitor cdp-22 was
used to treat HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines.
Compared with treatment with AE or cdp-22 alone, the
combined therapy more strongly inhibited phosphorylation
of ILK and downstream HER-2, YB-1, and Twist protein
expressions (Figure 6B). Extracellular growth factor and
cell surface tyrosine receptor kinase activation resulted
in PI3K activation, followed by phosphorylation of the
downstream mTOR [30]. We investigated whether AE
treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt at serine
473 and mTOR at serine 2448. The results showed that
increasing concentrations of AE reduced phosphorylation
of Akt at serine 473 and mTOR at serine 2448 (Figure 6C).
We confirmed these results through the use of constitutively
active Akt (CA-Akt), which continued to phosphorylate
Akt. The results confirmed that treatment with CA-Akt
alone significantly increased Akt phosphorylation and
downstream protein expression. Combining CA-Akt and
AE treatment substantially restored the inhibition of AE
in downstream proteins p-mTOR, HER-2, YB-1, and
Twist (Figure 6D). Increased GSK3β phosphorylation

has been shown to cause rapid cancer growth. Increasing
concentrations of AE also inhibited GSK3β phosphorylation
(Figure 6E). GSK3β inhibitor SB216763 was used to
observe the effect of AE on downstream protein expression
through the GSK3β pathway. The results showed that
combined treatment more significantly inhibited GSK3β
phosphorylation and downstream HER-2, YB-1, and
Twist expressions (Figure 6F). Using nuclear/cytoplasmic
separation techniques, we observed whether AE inhibited
transport of transcription factors into the nucleus. The
results showed that AE treatment for 24 h significantly
inhibited the transport of Twist and YB-1 into the nucleus.
PARP and β-tubulin were used as nucleus and cytoplasmic
markers, respectively (Figure 6G). Thus, AE inhibited the
expression of YB-1 through the ILK signaling pathway in
HER-2-overexpressing cell lines.

day for 5 consecutive days, and tumor size changes were
observed twice weekly. AE significantly inhibited tumor
size (Figure 7A). The tumors of representative mice showed
the same result (Figure 7B). The tumors were removed to
observe its appearance (Figure 7C) and weight (Figure 7D);
increasing AE concentrations significantly inhibited tumor
size and weight. Interestingly, AE did not cause weight
loss in mice. (Figure 7E). We examined HER-2, YB-1,
and E-cadherin expression in the tumor specimen through
Western blotting. The results confirmed that AE treatment
significantly reduced HER-2 and YB-1 oncogenic protein
expression and restored epithelial cell adhesion protein
E-cadherin expression (Figure 7F). Similar results were
clearly observed in IHC staining; AE treatment significantly
reduced HER-2, YB-1, and cell proliferation marker
Ki67 expression (Figure 7G). Therefore, AE treatment
significantly inhibited in vivo tumors.

patients [33]. Due to the recurrence rate of HER-2overexpressing breast cancer, early HER-2 breast cancer
treatment after surgery depends on the patient’s condition;
they can undergo hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or
radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment [34]. The target agent
therapy clearly influences relapse prevention of HER-2overexpressing breast cancer; therefore, the use of a target
therapy as an adjuvant therapy is very crucial [35].
In recent years, much attention has been paid to
the anti-tumor effect of emodin, with the main focus on
neuroectodermal tumors, liver cancer, lung squamous
cell carcinoma, merkel cell skin cancer, stomach cancer,
and leukemia [36]. Emodin inhibits K562 leukemia
cells and prolongs survival [37]. A possible mechanism
is the inhibition of cancer cell DNA, RNA, and protein
biosynthesis. AE (1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-9,10anthracenedione) is a bioactive anthraquinone compound
extracted from rhubarb roots. It effectively inhibits
the proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines and
induces apoptosis [38]. However, the inhibition of growth
ability and mechanism of AE in HER-2-overexpressing
cell lines are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the
molecular mechanisms of the anthraquinone compounds
inducing apoptosis of HER-2-overexpressing human
breast cancer cell lines. In particular, we compared three
anthraquinones, namely emodin, AE, and rhein, for HER2 inhibitory activity and the optimal AE concentration
(Figure 1A–1D). We confirmed that AE treatment mainly
reduced cancer cell viability by inducing apoptosis
(Figure 2H–2J).

DISCUSSION
HER-2 is found on the surface of all normal cells
and receives signals for the regulation of cell growth [31].
However, in cancer cells, owing to gene amplification, many
HER-2 receptor proteins are present on the surface of cells,
leading to excessive growth of cells [32]. Cancer cells show
rapid growth, division, and even more rapid metastasis.
Compared with patients with early HER-2-overexpressing
breast cancer, the probability of recurrence after resection
is higher in patients with HER-2 overexpression, which
accounts for approximately 25–30% of all breast cancer

Recent studies have shown that various
characteristics of cancer stem cells, such as their high
mobility, immune specificity, and metabolic specificity,
differ considerably from our understanding of cancer
cells; therefore, the development of cancer stem cell
treatment is the future of cancer treatment [39–41].
The multifunctional protein YB-1 has been found in
many cancers, with the common characteristics of
promotion of stem cell marker expression, improvement
of mobility, and enhancement of cancer drug resistance
gene expression [42–45]. Therefore, the inhibition of
YB-1 expression has attracted much attention. In this
study, we confirmed that AE treatment significantly
reduced YB-1 expression in HER-2-overexpressing cell
lines (Figure 3).
EMT is a key event in cancer metastasis. Cancer
metastasis is directly related to Twist gene transfection
during cancer cell hypoxia [46]. Hypoxia of head and
neck cancer most likely occurs if the transfection of
the hypoxic gene HIF-1α also results in the transfer of
Twist and Snail genes, resulting in the worst prognosis in
patients [47]. Hypoxia gene HIF-1α overexpression can
cause lung metastases in mice [48, 49]. Simultaneous
expression of hypoxia gene HIF-1α in head and neck
cancer tumor tissues promotes the expression of Twist
and Snail genes, leading to the worst prognosis [50, 51].
This study confirmed that AE treatment significantly
inhibited the oncogenic Twist expression (Figure 4).
AE treatment significantly restored epithelial cell
marker protein E-cadherin, inhibited the stromal
cell marker protein vimentin, and suppressed EMTassociated transcription factors, including Twist, Snail,
Slug, and HIF-1α, inhibiting EMT induction in cancer
cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that AE significantly

inhibited HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cell
migration and invasion. Interestingly, the stem cell
experiments confirmed that AE effectively inhibited the
growth of stem cells (Figure 5).
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathway
can regulate gene expression and is crucial in breast
tumor cell growth proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis
[52, 53]. ILK kinase activity and expression affect the
activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 [54, 55]. Studies have
indicated that the inhibition of Akt activity leads to
decreased activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 5D).
This study confirmed that increasing concentrations of
AE significantly inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal
transduction pathway. In particular, AE inhibited the
oncogenic transcription factors Twist and YB-1 from
entering the nucleus, thereby inhibiting downstream
oncogenic protein expression (Figure 6).
In the xenograft model, SkBr3 cells were
subcutaneously injected to BALB/c nude mice and
successfully induced subcutaneously tumors in BALB/c
nude mice. Notably, compared with the control group,
AE treatment for 28 days caused 80% inhibition of tumor
growth; weight loss did not occur, thus confirming its
low toxicity. Moreover, AE inhibited HER-2 and YB-1
expression in tumor tissue and restored E-cadherin
expression (Figure 7).
In summary, the results indicated that AE inhibited
the expression of HER-2 through the downregulation
of YB-1. AE suppressed YB-1 expression through the
downregulation of ILK/Akt/mTOR-regulated Twist
expression in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
(Figure 8). Importantly, AE treatment could be used for
clinically treating patients with HER-2 overexpression in
the future.

PARP and Twist were purchased from GeneTex (Beverly,
MA, USA). Anti-HER-2, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473),
anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-Snail, and anti-Slug
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly,
MA, USA). Primary antibodies against ILK, phosphor-ILK
(Thr173), phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), and phospho-GSK3β
(Ser9) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies against YB-1 and
β-Actin were purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA,
USA). The antibody against HIF-1α was purchased from BD
Biosciences Clontech (San Jose, CA, USA). For Western
blotting, the secondary antibodies of horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit
IgG were obtained from Millipore (Temecula, CA, USA),
and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Emodin, AE, and rhein were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The RNAi Consortium of
YBX-1 was selected by the National RNAi Core Facility.

Western blotting
Cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 × 106 per dish) were
treated with the indicated drugs. After treatment, total
proteins were extracted by adding 50 μL cold lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1mM NaF; 150 mM NaCl;
1 mM EGTA; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride;
1% NP-40; and 10 mg/mL leupeptin) to the cell pellets
overnight at −20°C, followed by centrifugation at 12 000
× g for 30 minutes. Western blotting was conducted as
recently described [57].

Cell transfection
Cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L YBX-1-siRNA
and cDNA-HER-2 using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a serum-free medium. Six hours
after transfection, the medium was replaced with a medium
supplemented with 10% FBS. After a 24-h transfection,
medium was replaced with a medium supplemented with
10% FBS with or without AE (10 or 20 μM), and the cells
were incubated for 48 h. After harvesting, the cells were
lysed and prepared for Western blotting.

Cell culture

Immunofluorescence

Human breast cancer cell lines SkBr3, BT-474, MDAMB-453, MCF-7, BT-20, MDA-MB-231 and human breast
cell MCF-10A were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Human breast
cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 and Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI 1640) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin. Human breast cell MCF-10A was
cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/
F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, Insulin 10 μg/mL,
EGF 20 ng/mL and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were
incubated at 37°C in an incubator containing 5% CO2.

Expression of HER-2, YB-1, Twist, and E-cadherin
in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal
microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary
antibody [58].

MTT assay

Soft agar assay

Cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells per well in triplicate
in 24-well plates and incubated in a medium containing
10% FBS. After 24 h of incubation, the complete medium
was replaced with the test medium containing vehicle
control or various doses of emodin, AE, and rhein for 24,
48, and 72 h at 37°C. MTT solution (stock concentration:
5 mg/mL in PBS) was diluted to 500 μg/mL. MTT working
solution (100 μL) was added to each well and incubated at
37°C for 2 h. The absorbance was measured at 590 nm by
using a 96-well plated reader.

SkBr3 cells were treated with 40 μM emodin, AE,
and rhein or various doses of AE. Cells were suspended in
a medium containing 0.4% agar and overlaid on 1% agar
in 24-well plates (500 cells per well), respectively. After
2–3 weeks, colonies were counted and photographed.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Colony formation assay
SkBr3 cells were seeded into six-well plates with
2 mL culture medium containing 10% FBS. The colonies
were counted after culturing in DMEM-F12 containing
10% FBS at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere.
SkBr3 cells were washed twice with PBS, stained with
Giemsa, and colonies with > 50 cells were counted.

Migration assay
Cell monolayers were wounded using a sterile
pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris.

(DTT) and centrifuged at 16 000 × g for 10 minutes, and
the supernatant was extracted as cytosolic fractions.
Subsequently, cell pellets were prepared in NER buffer
with protease inhibitor and DTT. After vortexing 4 times
for 15 seconds, the cells were centrifuged at 16 000 ×
g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was extracted
as nuclear fractions. All experiments were performed
using the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision,
Milpitas, CA, USA) according to manufacturer
instructions. Proteins in the cytosolic and nuclear
fractions were quantified through Bradford assays (BioRad), and protein expression was measured through
Western blotting.

Cells were treated with various doses of AE for 24 h.
The phase contrast images of the wounds were obtained
at 37°C for incubation for 0 and 24 h, and three separate
experiments were performed.

Invasion assays
SkBr3 cell invasion assays were performed in
6.5-mm Transwell chambers (8.0-μm pore size) (Coring
Incorporation, NY, USA), and the polycarbonate filters
were coated with diluted matrigel (BD Biosciences).
SkBr3 cells without and with AE were added to the
coated filters (6 × 104 cells per filter) in 200 μL serumfree DMEM-F12 in triplicate wells. DMEM-F12 medium
containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers.
After 24-h incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 and 95%
humidity incubator, the cells that did not migrate and
remained on the upper surface of the filter; they were
wiped off using a cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed
in 95% alcohol for 10 minutes and stained with Giemsa
for 10 minutes.

In vivo studies
Female BALB/c nude mice (18–20 g; 6–8 weeks
of age) were purchased from the National Animal Center
(Taipei, Taiwan) and maintained in pressurized ventilated
cage in accordance with institutional regulations. SkBr3
cells (3 × 106) were inoculated subcutaneous into the right
flank of the mice. Seven days after inoculation, when
tumor volumes were larger than 100 mm3, the mice were
divided into four groups (six mice per group) and treated
daily with vehicle alone and various doses of AE (12.5,
25, and 50 mg/kg). The mice were weighed, and their
tumors were measured using calipers twice per week by
using a digital caliper. The tumor volume was calculated
using the following formula: (width × length2)/2. On the
final day of treatment, the mice were sacrificed; the tumors
were excised, weighed, and sectioned; the tumor sections
were embedded in an optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
compound and frozen at −70°C.

Gelatin zymography assay
Gelatin zymography was performed on protein
extracts from the SkBr3 cells. In brief, the cells were rinsed
three times with DPBS and cultured in 3 mL serum-free
DMEM-F12 for 24 h. The cells without and with AE were
separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE containing 1 mg/mL gelatin.
Following electrophoresis at 48 °C, the gel was soaked in
2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, rinsed three times in
H2O, transferred to a bath containing 0.1 M glycine-NaOH
(pH 8.3), and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Subsequently, the
gel was fixed, stained with 0.5% Coomassie blue in 30%
isopropanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 h, and destained in
12.5% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid.

Immunohistochemical staining
Sections frozen in OCT were fixed in acetone and
chloroform. After overnight incubation with primary
antibodies, including mouse monoclonal anti-HER-2, antiYB-1, and anti-E-cadherin, the slides were washed again
with Tris-buffered saline and Tween20 and incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibodies and subsequently with
the avidin–biotin–horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector
Laboratories, San Mateo, CA, USA). Antibody detection
was performed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and the tissue
sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin,
washed, mounted with Universal Mount, and dried on
a 56°C hot plate. The prepared slides were examined
through light microscopy.

Quantitative PCR assay
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy® Plus Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was amplified
using gene-specific primers and the Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Reverse
transcription of mRNA was performed using the
RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo
Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions.
mRNA expression was normalized to human YBX-1 and
TWIST1 expression. The results are presented as the
relative fold expression compared with the respective
control treatment.

Statistical analyses

Nuclear extraction

All values are expressed as mean ± SD. Each
value is the mean of at least three separate experiments
in each group. The two-tailed Student t test was used to
compare the continuous variables between the two groups
(*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).

The cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and
centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 minutes; the supernatant was
discarded. Cell pellets were first prepared in cytosolic
extraction buffer with protease inhibitor and dithiothreitol
