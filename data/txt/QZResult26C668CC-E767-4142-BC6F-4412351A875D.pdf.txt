Abstract
Ewing sarcomas (ES) are highly malignant bone or soft tissue tumors. Genetically,
ES are defined by balanced chromosomal EWS/ETS translocations, which give rise
to chimeric proteins (EWS-ETS) that generate an oncogenic transcriptional program
associated with altered epigenetic marks throughout the genome. By use of an
inhibitor (JQ1) blocking BET bromodomain binding proteins (BRDs) we strikingly
observed a strong down-regulation of the predominant EWS-ETS protein EWS-FLI1
in a dose dependent manner. This was further enhanced by co-treatment with an
inhibitor of the PI3K pathway. Microarray analysis further revealed JQ1 treatment
to block a typical ES associated expression program. The effect on this expression
program was mimicked by RNA interference with BRD3 or BRD4 expression, indicating
that the EWS-FLI1 mediated expression profile is at least in part mediated via such
epigenetic readers. Consequently, contact dependent and independent proliferation of
different ES lines was strongly inhibited. Mechanistically, treatment of ES resulted in
a partial arrest of the cell cycle as well as induction of apoptosis. Tumor development
was suppressed dose dependently in a xeno-transplant model in immune deficient
mice, overall indicating that ES may be susceptible to treatment with epigenetic
inhibitors blocking BET bromodomain activity and the associated pathognomonic EWSETS transcriptional program.

INTRODUCTION

improved with the development of multimodal therapeutic
approaches, the survival rate of patients with advanced,
multifocal disease is still associated with fatal outcome
[9-11]. Especially multifocal bone or bone marrow
disease and the development of metastases in bones are
catastrophic events in the clinical course of ES patients
[9, 12]. Genetically, ES is defined by specific balanced
chromosomal EWS/ETS translocations which give rise
to oncogenic chimeric proteins, the most common being
EWS-FLI1 as a consequence of the t(11;22)(q24;q12)

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a highly malignant bone
and soft tissue neoplasia of still enigmatic histogenesis
with a prominent stemness phenotype [1, 2]. Histogenesis
may be endothelial, neuroectodermal [3-5] or osteochondrogenic [6, 7]. ES are characterized by early
metastasis into lung and bone tissues. Metastasis is
commonly haematogenous and related to stemness [1, 4,
8]. Even though prognosis for ES patients has markedly

translocation [13-15]. Other contributing somatic
mutations involved in disease development have only been
observed at low frequency [16-19].
Thus, cancer in children is not solely a genetic
disease and can neither be understood nor cured
presumably without epigenetics. We previously identified
the histone methyl-transferase Enhancer of Zeste,
Drosophila, Homolog 2 (EZH2), the enzymatic subunit
of the polycomb PRC2 complex, to be over-expressed
and regulated as a downstream event via EWS-FLI1
in ES. RNA interference of EZH2 suppressed tumor
development and metastasis in vivo and microarray
analysis of EZH2 knock down revealed an EZH2maintained, undifferentiated, reversible phenotype in ES
[1]. EZH2 suppression resulted in a generalized loss of
H3K27me3 as well as increase in H3 acetylation. ChIPChip assays for H3K27me3 verified such genes that had
specifically lost H3K27me3 upon EZH2 silencing [8],
suggesting that malignant stemness features are preserved
via epigenetic mechanisms. Recent results further indicate
that EWS-ETS proteins not only deregulate components of
the epigenetic machinery in ES [1], but in addition create
specific epigenetic marks [20, 21] that might be addressed
by epigenetic therapy.
BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and the testisspecific BRDT) are bromodomain (BRD) containing
proteins that belong to the bromo and extraterminal (BET)
subset of BRD proteins. They are nuclear proteins that
carry 2 bromodomains and an additional ET domain, and
are implicated in chromatin interactions [22]. They seem to
associate with transcription complexes and with acetylated
chromatin [23]. Specific inhibitors of BET proteins such as
I-BET151 or JQ1 resulted in displacement of BRDs from
chromatin and inhibition of transcription at key genes such
as BCL2, MYC, and CDK6 [23]. Initially it was shown
that JQ1 could block the growth of a rare, aggressive
form of human squamous carcinoma with BRD4-NUT
translocation [24] as well as of MYC transformed
multiple myeloma [25]. Effectivity of JQ1 and inhibition
of C-MYC or N-MYC was also demonstrated for AML
[26] or neuroblastoma [27], respectively.
In addition to BET inhibitors, also enhanced activity
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been
linked to MYC turnover [28] and thereby might potentially
enhance the activity of BET inhibitors. Indeed, PI3K
inhibition has been suggested as therapeutic option in ES
before [29] and recent evidence suggests that the pathway
can modulate expression of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein
itself [30]. By use of the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1
we significantly blocked proliferation and in vivo tumor
growth of different ES lines and strikingly observed a
strong down-regulation of the pathognomonic EWS-FLI1
protein. Subsequent analysis revealed that JQ1 treatment
blocked an ES specific expression program and enhanced
apoptosis of treated cell lines.

JQ1 blocks EWS-FLI1 expression in ES
In a previous microarray analysis we identified the
proto-oncogene MYC as being persistently up-regulated in
ES (Supplementary Figure S1). To analyze the relevance of
its expression, we employed the potent BET bromodomain
inhibitor JQ1 and the PI3K inhibitor BEZ235 as possible
pathways regulating MYC expression in ES cells and
compared their impact to such on mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs). None of the analyzed ES cells showed any
down-regulation of MYC expression after treatment with
different concentrations of JQ1 (Figure 1A, Top) while in
contrast MSCs showed an up to 65% down-regulation after
5μM JQ1 treatment in VH54.2 cells (Figure 1A, Bottom).
Similarly, also BEZ235 treatment revealed no influence
on MYC expression in ES (data not shown). Therefore,
we became curious whether the characteristic oncofusion
protein EWS-FLI1 is involved in MYC regulation and
analyzed its expression upon treatment (Figure 1B and
Supplementary Figure S2A). Surprisingly, expression of
EWS-FLI1 was reduced after either just JQ1 treatment
or combined JQ1 and BEZ235 treatment, which was
also confirmed at protein level (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
PARP1 and caspase 7 cleavage (Figure 1C) increased after
24 as well as 48 hours JQ1 or combined JQ1 and BEZ235
treatment, indicating induction of apoptosis of ES cells
especially after JQ1 and combination treatment.

JQ1 down-regulates an ES specific expression
profile
To clarify to which extent JQ1 influences gene
expression in ES cells, we carried out microarray
analyses on JQ1 treated A673 and TC-71 cells. Analysis
of differentially expressed genes using volcano plots
indicated 720 and 405 genes significantly up- and
down-regulated upon treatment in TC-71 and A673,
respectively (P-value < 0.01; Figure 2A). Comparison of
expression data between both cell lines at a fold change
± 1.5 by Venn analysis (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.
be/webtools/Venn/) revealed 811 shared, differentially
expressed genes (Figure 2B). Further, a heat map of
244 differentially expressed genes in both cell lines
(fold change > 1.8) is shown (Figure 2C). Most of the
identified genes were down-regulated after JQ1 treatment
(188 genes were down-regulated, 57 were up-regulated,
GSE72673). Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) identified a down-regulation of gene sets typical
for EWS-FLI1 fusion targets as identified by Zhang
and colleagues [31] as well as those for Ewing sarcoma
progenitors identified by Riggi et al. [32] (Figure 2D),
indicating that JQ1 inhibits EWS-FLI1 expression and

thereby similarly inhibits an ES typical expression profile
(Supplementary Table S1). Such genes including DKK2,
EZH2, GPR64, PAPPA, STEAP1, and STK32B were shown
to be consistently up-regulated and demonstrated to be
involved in ES pathogenesis [1, 6, 8, 33, 34]. They were
verified to be down-regulated by JQ1 treatment using qRTPCR, overall confirming results of the microarray analysis
(Figure 2E).

(Figure 3D). These results together with the observed
PARP1 and caspase 7 cleavage (Figure 1C) indicate a
strong effect of JQ1 on apoptosis induction in ES.

JQ1 reduces tumor growth in vivo in a dose
dependent manner
As already demonstrated by others [24-27], JQ1
may also have a therapeutic effect in vivo. Therefore we
also evaluated the therapeutic suitability of ES cells to JQ1
treatment in a xenograft mouse model of Rag2-/-γc-/- mice
by implanting tumor cells s.c. into mice. Starting with 50
mg/kg body weight every other day by intraperitoneal
injection of JQ1 or vehicle we observed no growth rate
reduction on A673 or TC-71 cells, respectively (Figure
4A). Assuming that this concentration of JQ1 might be
too low for a pharmaceutically effective supply over two
days we also tested more frequent doses on TC-71 cells.
Administration of 50 mg/kg twice daily for a period of
14 days resulted in an elongated survival of treated mice
(Figure 4B, Top and 4D). To confirm these results we
chose SK-N-MC due to its strict dependency on EWSFLI1 expression. Mice were treated twice daily with 50
mg/kg for 23 days revealing a significant growth reduction
(Figure 4B, bottom) and decreased tumor weight (Figure
4E). Further, tumors prepared at the end of the experiment
and analyzed immunohistochemically for caspase 3
expression revealed an increased apoptosis rate in tumors
treated with JQ1 (Figure 4C). However, further increase to
75 mg/kg twice daily was too toxic and resulted in severe
weight loss and death of some mice (data not shown).
Overall, both experiments demonstrated a significant
inhibition of ES growth in vivo at higher JQ1 dosage
and the potential therapeutic value of BET bromodomain
inhibitors for the treatment of ES.

RNA interference of different BRDs by specific
siRNAs mimics the JQ1 treatment effect in ES
BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 but not BRDT genes are well
expressed in ES (Supplementary Figure S1). While JQ1
has been reported to be most specific for BRD4 protein,
binding to the remaining BRD proteins was also observed,
although to a lesser extent [24]. Therefore BRD2, 3 or 4
were transiently down-regulated by specific siRNA in ES
and their influence on an ES specific expression profile
was analyzed. While BRD2 knock down did not result in
any expression changes on such genes (Supplementary
Figure S2B), BRD3 and BRD4 knock down uniformly
resulted in a similar down-regulation of ES specific genes
(Figure 2F) as observed after JQ1 treatment (Figure 2E),
concluding that BRD3 as well as BRD4 might be the
essential targets of JQ1 treatment hereby repressing the
pathognomonic EWS-FLI1 driven expression profile.

JQ1 treatment inhibits proliferation, cell cycle
progression and promotes apoptosis
Based on these results, we asked whether the
inhibition of the EWS-FLI1 specific expression profile
may also affect the growth abilities of ES. Using the
xCELLigence assay, we compared contact dependent
growth of different ES lines A673, SK-N-MC and TC71 either treated with 2μM JQ1 or just DMSO (Figure
3A). Neither of the analyzed cells showed a significant
increase of cell numbers after JQ1 application. Similarly,
contact independent growth of JQ1 treated A673, SKN-MC and TC-71 revealed a strong reduction of colony
formation (Figure 3B) in methylcellulose assay. We
subsequently asked whether this reduction of proliferative
capacity might be due to changes in cell cycle progression.
Flow cytometry analysis for all 3 cell lines depicted a
reduction of G2-M phase while an increase in G1 phase
was observed after JQ1 treatment in SK-N-MC and TC71 cells (Figure 3C) as well as an extension of S phase
in A673 and SK-N-MC cells. BEZ235 treatment more
consistently increased the G1 phase of all 3 cell lines
and had no additional effect on the cell cycle when
combined with JQ1 (Figure 3C). In addition, the caspase
3 glow assay revealed an increase of apoptosis after JQ1
treatment in A673 and TC-71 that was further increased
by combined treatment with BEZ235 in SK-N-MC cells

DISCUSSION
In Ewing sarcoma (ES) the deregulation of
components of the epigenetic machinery was previously
demonstrated as an important step for tumor formation [1,
8]. Furthermore, it was recently shown that EWS-FLI1
employs divergent chromatin remodeling mechanisms to
activate or repress transcription [20, 21]. Herein altered
epigenetic marks were identified that generated specific
acetyl-lysine moieties on histones and may be targeted by
epigenetic reader proteins such as BET proteins (BRD2,
BRD3, BRD4). Interestingly, all three BET proteins are
well expressed in ES and may be targeted by specific
inhibitors of BET proteins such as I-BET151 [23] or
JQ1 [24]. Such treatment resulted in dislodgment of
BRDs from chromatin in other tumors and inhibition
of transcription at key genes involved in apoptosis, cell
cycle regulation and oncogenesis [26, 27], [35] [36]. It
was demonstrated that JQ1 could block tumor growth and

that based on the biology of this tumor may result in
synergistic growth inhibitory effects.
For example, treatment with BEZ235 clearly
inhibited EWS-FLI1 expression and in combination with
JQ1 further increased apoptosis induction indicating that
combination treatment of JQ1 with PI3K/mTOR inhibition
should be a promising strategy for future therapy of ES.
Also, combination treatment of JQ1 with substances
like YK-4-279 that directly binds to EWS-FLI1 and
inhibits its oncogenic activity [45, 46] via blockade of
specific protein interaction with factors important for
mRNA splicing [47] and transcription [45] may result
in synergistic effects on tumor growth and needs to be
explored in preclinical models of ES.
Similarly, combination treatment with EZH2
inhibitors such as GSK126 [48, 49] may further increase
therapeutic efficacy and due to potential synergistic effects
decrease JQ1 dose levels required for successful treatment
of ES.
Here, we at first demonstrated that tumor
development was dose dependently suppressed by
intra-peritoneal JQ1 application in a xeno-transplant
model of ES–bearing immune deficient Rag2-/-γc-/- mice.
Therapeutic efficacious doses, although high, were within
the range published previously [24, 27, 35]. Overall, our
results demonstrate that MYC or EWS-FLI1 mediated
pathognomonic expression programs may be similarly
targeted by BET bromodomain inhibition, casting BET
protein inhibition appropriate as a potential platform for
future combination therapy of this disease.

a recurring feature of the consequences of JQ1 / I-BET151
treatment was inhibition of MYC, N-MYC or FOSL [37]
expression, respectively in these tumors.
MYC over-expression is well known in ES. Its level
of expression seems to be directly regulated via EWSFLI1 [38]. By use of JQ1 in different ES cell lines we
significantly blocked their proliferation and strikingly
observed a strong down-regulation of the pathognomonic
EWS-FLI1 protein. We saw no inhibition of MYC
expression in ES lines whereas its inhibition was readily
observed in MSC.
JQ1 treatment suppressed a number of genes typical
for ES specific expression profiles [5, 8, 32]. For example
GPR64, a new excellent marker of ES [33], was downregulated after JQ1 treatment. Similarly, the expression
of DKK2, a key player of ES invasiveness and osteolytic
tumor growth [6], was greatly reduced by JQ1. Further,
other genes consistently up-regulated and/or shown to
be involved in ES pathogenesis such as EZH2, PAPPA,
STEAP1, and STK32B [1, 8, 34] were uniformly inhibited
by JQ1.
Consistently fewer genes were found to be upregulated after JQ1 treatment and included genes involved
mainly in pathways for cell maturation, differentiation,
etc. (GSE72673), confirming that EWS-FLI1 itself is
abrogating differentiation programs and is the driver of
the immature phenotype of this disease [1, 29].
Interestingly, the JQ1 treatment effect on this
expression program of ES lines was mimicked by specific
siRNA-mediated knock down of BRD3 or BRD4 but not
BRD2 expression, demonstrating that not only BRD4 is an
important epigenetic reader protein in ES. Displacement of
BRD3/4 by specific inhibitors has already been shown in
MLL-fusion positive leukemia [23]. While BRD3 seems
to preferentially associate with hyper-acetylated chromatin
along the entire lengths of transcribed genes [39], BRD4binding has also been observed in enhancer regions [40].
To what areas of chromatin BET proteins bind in ES has
to be further investigated.
JQ1 treatment not only suppressed an ES specific
expression profile but also blocked contact dependent and
independent proliferation of different ES lines. This seems
to be due to a partial G1 arrest and S phase elongation of
the cell cycle as demonstrated previously [24]. In addition,
induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by PARP1-,
CASP7-cleavage and increased CASP3 activity seems to
significantly contribute to the reduction of the proliferative
ability of ES lines. Single or combination treatment with
the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 [41] did increase
apoptosis of ES cell lines although single treatment with
BEZ235 was less effective than JQ1 application.
However, a number of substances initially also
demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models such as single
treatment with ARA-C [42] or anti-IGFR [43] but in phase
I clinical trials delivered transient [29] or disappointing
results [44], emphasizing the need to combine drugs

testis, uterus, fetal brain, and fetal liver. Array data were
submitted at GEO (GSE45544).

We thank Kristina von Heyking for careful reading
of the manuscript. We are also grateful to James E.
Bradner for the generous support with JQ1.

Animal model
Immune deficient Rag2-/-γc-/- mice on a BALB/c
background were obtained from the Central Institute for
Experimental Animals (Kawasaki, Japan) and maintained
in our animal facility under pathogen-free conditions in
accordance with the institutional guidelines and approval
by local authorities (Regierung von Oberbayern).
Experiments were performed in 6-20 week old mice.

of Biomarkers in Ewing Sarcoma for Personalised
Translational Medicine (PROVABES; 01KT1311),
Funding Programs of the Federal Ministry of Education
and Research (BMBF), Germany.

In vivo experiments
To examine in vivo tumorigenicity, 2-3 x 106 ES
cells were injected subcutaneously into the inguinal
region of immune deficient Rag2-/-γc-/- mice. JQ1 was
handled and dissolved as recommended by the Bradner
lab and administered at 50 mg/kg body weight intra
peritoneal either twice daily or every other day. Mice were
monitored daily and tumor xenografts were measured with
digital calipers, and tumor volume was calculated as (L x
W2) / 2, where L is length and W is width. Experimental
endpoints were determined by completion of treatment
or attainment of tumor burden exceeding 1 cm3. Upon
reaching endpoints, mice were humanely euthanized and
tumors excised and characterized.

Histology

REFERENCES

Histological analysis of tumor specimens was
performed in a minimum of 5 mice per group. Tissues
organs were fixed in phosphate buffered 4% formaldehyde
and paraffin embedded. 3-5µm thick sections from all
tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Apoptosis was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
using cleaved Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling) as primary
antibody. The IHC was performed using the streptavidin–
peroxidase method with an automated immunostainer
(DiscoveryXT; Roche, Penzberg, Germany), All sections
were reviewed and interpreted by two pathologists.
