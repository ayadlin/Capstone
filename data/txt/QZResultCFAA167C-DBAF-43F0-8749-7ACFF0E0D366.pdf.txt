Spleen Deflation and Beyond: The Pros and
Cons of Janus Kinase 2 Inhibitor Therapy for
Patients With Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
Alfonso Quintás-Cardama, MD and Srdan Verstovsek, MD, PhD

The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) are malignancies that frequently harbor the recurrent somatic point mutation JAK2V617F. The discovery
of this mutation has fueled the development of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors. Available results have indicated that
JAK2 inhibitors are particularly effective at reducing spleen size. However, the activity of these agents is multifaceted
and also involves a marked improvement of systemic symptoms and, for those agents with dual JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitory activity, a marked reduction in the levels of circulating cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.
Because JAK2 inhibitors are not specific for JAK2V617F, responses have also been observed in JAK2V617F-negative
MPNs because of the inhibition of wild-type JAK2, which is also likely responsible for the induction of cytopenias in
patients with MF and for the normalization of peripheral blood counts observed in patients with ET or PV. Given the
distinct mortality and morbidity associated with ET, PV, and MF, the use of JAK2 inhibitors appears reasonable for
patients with MF as well as for those with ET or PV who have become resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. Ongoing
randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials will further delineate the role of these agents in the management of
patients with MPNs. The pros and cons of JAK2 kinase inhibitor therapy are herein discussed. Cancer 2012;118:870–7.

INTRODUCTION
Therapy for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms: Status Quo
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) arise from a stem/hematopoietic progenitor cell but
present with distinct phenotypic manifestations.1 Although patients with ET typically present with an abnormally elevated platelet count, those with PV present with an elevated hematocrit level. Both groups of patients frequently present
with an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, which has been reported in association with an increased risk of thrombotic events. In addition, patients with ET or PV demonstrate a proclivity to develop hemorrhagic complications. MF is
characterized by the presence of myelopthisis, advanced bone marrow reticulin and collagen fibrosis with or without osteosclerosis, an excess of CD34-positive (CD34þ) cells in the peripheral blood, a tendency to develop vascular events, and
remarkably debilitating constitutional symptoms. Over time, ET and PV frequently evolve into a fibrotic state that closely
resembles MF and is referred to as post-ET or post-PV MF. All 3 MPNs (ET, PV, and MF) may progress to acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).
Current Therapy for Patients With MPNs

Obviously, the desideratum when treating a malignancy is complete cure. Realistically, such an objective in patients
with MPNs can only be achieved with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).2,3 However, the life expectancy of

patients with ET is similar to that of age-matched controls, whereas that of patients with PV is only slightly
shorter, which calls into question the use in those malignancies of therapies, such as SCT, that are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. However, patients
with MF have a significantly reduced survival compared
with age-matched controls that, in selected cases, may justify the use of a risky approach with curative intent. In
patients with MF, allogeneic SCT conditioned with
reduced intensity regimens produces 5-year event-free
and overall survival rates of 51% and 67%, respectively.4
Therefore, a small percentage of patients with MF benefit
greatly from SCT. However, its usefulness is hampered by
donor availability, patient age (which is typically advanced
in patients with MF), and comorbidities (typically present
in patients of advanced age). In addition, the procedure is
associated with important transplantation-related mortality,5 and unknown but presumably high morbidity. On
those grounds, most patients with MF are managed with
other therapies. Beyond SCT, therapy for MF does not
appear to prolong survival and its use should be considered palliative in intent.
What Are the Pressing Issues When Treating
Patients With MPNs?

The main objective when treating patients with ET
or PV is to prevent thrombotic and hemorrhagic events as
well as progression to AML. Patients with low-risk ET
typically do not require therapy. Those with low-risk PV
are most likely best managed with low-dose aspirin and
phlebotomies to keep the hematocrit below 45% in men
and 42% in women. Whether such strict hematocrit control in patients with PV is absolutely necessary to achieve
an appropriate level of prevention of thrombotic and
hemorrhagic complications compared with more lax hematocrit control remains controversial.6 For patients with
either high-risk ET or PV, cytoreductive therapy with
hydroxyurea (or anagrelide for patients with ET) remains
standard frontline therapy.7,8 In patients with high-risk
PV, low-dose aspirin has been shown to improve microvascular complications as well as transient ischemic attacks
in patients failing aspiring therapy.7,9 To the best of our
knowledge, hydroxyurea is the only cytoreductive agent
that has been demonstrated to diminish the risk of thrombotic events in a randomized clinical trial.10 Conversely,
hydroxyurea has reportedly failed to prolong survival or
prevent progression to MF in patients with PV.9
The management of patients with MF is more challenging. Patients with MF frequently present with pro-

found constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and/or
hepatomegaly, leukoerythroblastosis, anemia, collagen
and reticulin bone marrow fibrosis, angiogenesis, and
osteosclerosis,11 which frequently demand rapid intervention. Similar to ET and PV, patients with MF also exhibit
a proclivity to progress to AML and to develop hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.11-14 The prognosis
of the majority of patients with MF is grim and therapy
has been empirically directed toward palliating hypercatabolic symptoms, complications derived from massive
splenomegaly (hydroxyurea, splenic irradiation, and splenectomy), and anemia (corticosteroids, erythropoieticstimulating agents, and/or danazol), typically with lessthan-satisfactory results.

Janus Kinase 2 Inhibitors
Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a member of the JAK kinase family, which encompasses 4 different proteins: JAK1, JAK2,
JAK3, and TYK2. These proteins engage in interactions
with the intracellular tails of several cytokine receptors,
which result in the activation of members of the signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family
of transcription factors.15 The latter bind specific cognate
sequences at the promoter region of genes that regulate
proliferation and differentiation.16 The discovery that
most patients with MPNs carry the mutant JAK2V617F
enzyme has prompted the development of drugs to impair
its catalytic activity.15 Although several JAK2 inhibitors
are currently in clinical development (Table 1),17-20 some
aspects regarding its use for the treatment of patients with
MPN are worth noting. First, JAK2 inhibitors are not specific for the JAK2V617F mutation. JAK inhibitors are
designed to compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
at the catalytic domain of JAK kinases.15 However, the
JAK2V617F mutation maps to the JAK2 pseudokinase domain, which is distant from the catalytic domain. Thus,
JAK2 inhibitors target both wild-type and mutated
JAK2V617F proteins indiscriminately. Second, inhibiting
wild-type JAK2 is likely responsible for the induction of
cytopenias, mainly thrombocytopenia and anemia,
because both the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and the
thrombopoietin receptor (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene [MPL]) lack kinase activity and rely on
engaging the JAK2/STAT pathway to regulate normal
hematopoiesis. Finally, several JAK2 inhibitors inhibit
other members of the JAK family of kinases and/or other
protein kinases (eg, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3]),
which may contribute to different toxicity profiles.

Have we made any progress in the treatment of
MPNs with the introduction of JAK2 inhibitors? To answer such a question objectively, randomized phase 3
studies are necessary. In their absence, one needs to resort
to indirect comparisons between the results obtained to
date with JAK2 inhibitors and those historically reported
with standard therapy with regard to some of the important objectives in the treatment of MPNs (eg, correction
of splenomegaly and resolution of constitutional
symptoms).
Splenomegaly

An enlarged spleen is a cardinal clinical feature of
MF that frequently results in diminished quality of life
and great morbidity. Splenomegaly frequently causes early
satiety and abdominal discomfort and/or pain, exacerbates cytopenias via sequestration, and may result in episodes of intense pain because of splenic infarcts.21 The
initial approach to splenomegaly in patients with MF
involves the use of hydroxyurea. Limited data have suggested that hydroxyurea reduces the spleen size in < 50%
of patients, albeit such a reduction is seldom > 50%.21,22
Furthermore, spleen responses are frequently short-lived
and complicated by the exacerbation of cytopenias
because relatively high doses are required to achieve meaningful responses.21

872

The use of the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with prednisone
has been associated with reductions in spleen size in
approximately one-third of patients with MF.23-25
Splenomegaly responses have been observed in 55% of
patients treated with cladribine in a single-institution
trial, but were associated with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity.26 Splenectomy is obviously a radical
solution for splenomegaly, but it is associated with complications in approximately 25% of patients that can be
fatal in approximately 5% to 7% of cases.27,28 Therefore,
splenectomy may be indicated in good surgical candidates
with significant symptoms associated with splenomegaly
who have failed at least therapy with hydroxyurea and are
not candidates to receive JAK2 inhibitors.
Has any progress been made with JAK2 inhibitors
regarding the management of splenomegaly? Yes. In fact,
that is one of the most important highlights of JAK2 inhibitor therapy. For example, therapy with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in a phase 1/2 study involving 153
patients with MF (92% with splenomegaly measuring a
median of 19 cm; 82% were JAK2V617F positive) produced clinical improvement (CI; a  50% reduction in
palpable splenomegaly) according to the International
Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Therapy
(IWG-MRT) within the first 3 months of therapy in 44%

of patients. These responses were independent of JAK2
mutational status because similar responses were observed
in patients with or without the JAK2V617F mutation
(51% vs 45%, respectively).17 Ruxolitinib is currently
being tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study for patients with MF (COMFORTI; NCT00952289) in which the primary objective is to
determine the percentage of patients achieving a  35%
reduction in spleen volume as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging during 24 weeks of treatment. Preliminary
results indicate that ruxolitinib produces higher rates of
splenomegaly response and symptom improvement than
the control arm. A similar study comparing ruxolitinib
versus best available therapy in patients with MF (COMFORT-II; NCT00934544) is currently ongoing in
Europe.
After 6 and 12 cycles of therapy, splenomegaly
responses categorized as CI were observed in 39% and
47%, respectively, of patients with MF treated with the
JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor TG101348, which was obtained in
all responders within the first 20 weeks of treatment.18
Another JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor, lestaurtinib, has produced
more modest rates of splenomegaly response (22%) in
patients with MF in a phase 2 study, whereas therapy with
the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor CYT387 is associated with a CI
rate of 37% for splenomegaly that is reported to be generally durable.19 Although follow-up is still limited, the majority of JAK2 inhibitors produce a significant
splenomegaly response in patients otherwise previously
treated and frequently with high or intermediate-2 severity of MF before the initiation of these experimental
therapies, thus suggesting that the latter are generally efficacious and safe therapeutic options for patients with
complications derived from splenomegaly.
Constitutional Symptoms

In a symptom survey involving 1179 patients with
MPNs (PV in 405 patients, ET in 304 patients, and MF
in 456 patients),29 fatigue was reported by 80.7% of
patients, whereas pruritus occurred in 52.2%, night
sweats in 49.2%, bone pain in 43.9%, fever in 13.7%,
and weight loss in 13.1% of patients. The majority of
patients with MF experience moderate to severe fatigue
that cannot be directly attributed to a treatment-related
effect nor can it be explained by anemia alone. Furthermore, approximately one-third of patients needed assistance with activities of daily living, which was found to be
directly associated with the presence of MF, anemia, and/
or splenomegaly.29 The presence and severity of constitu-

tional symptoms are correlated with survival in patients
with MF. The current management of constitutional
symptoms is largely ineffective (splenectomy, hydroxyurea),11,22 and no available therapy directed at improving the symptoms of patients with MPNs (with the
exception of allogeneic SCT) is reported to improve overall survival.30 Ruxolitinib rapidly improves symptoms of
fatigue, night sweats, pruritus, and weight loss. Most
patients experienced a  50% improvement in global
and/or individual symptom scores as assessed by the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF).17 The
direct consequence of such activity was improvement in
performance status and ability to walk, as documented
using a 6-minute walk test.17 TG101348 also induced a
remarkable improvement in constitutional symptoms,
which resolved completely in many patients. However,
body weight did not improve significantly in patients
treated with this JAK2 inhibitor.18 Similar encouraging
results were observed with SB1518, a JAK2 inhibitor that
induced a 40% to 65% improvement over baseline with
regard to abdominal pain, bone pain, early satiety, inactivity, night sweats, and pruritus, typically within 6 months
from the initiation of treatment.20 Preliminary results
indicate that CYT387 can also improve constitutional
symptoms in the majority of patients with MF.19 Overall,
most JAK2 inhibitors tested were found to palliate constitutional symptoms to a great extent and improve performance status in a large percentage of patients treated. Given
that constitutional symptoms are a risk factor for overall
survival, it is tempting to speculate that the improvement
in systemic symptoms induced by JAK2 inhibitors may
improve overall survival.
Inflammatory Cytokines

Patients with MF have remarkably elevated levels of
proinflammatory cytokines, likely produced by deregulated cell-stroma interactions in the bone marrow.31 Such
an inflammatory component has been linked to the production of constitutional symptoms, MF, osteosclerosis,
translocation of CD34þ cells into the peripheral circulation,
and, perhaps, the promotion of clonal evolution.32-34
Recently, increased plasma levels of interleukin (IL)–8,
IL-2R, IL-12, IL-15, and interferon-c-inducible protein
10 (IP-10) assessed in 127 patients with MF were shown
to be independent predictors of inferior outcomes.35 IL-8,
IL-2R, IL-12, and IL-15 remained significantly prognostic when risk stratification according to the Dynamic
International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS Plus)
was included in the multivariable model.35 A 2-cytokine

873

Commentary

(IL-8/IL-2R) signature defined different subsets of
patients with specific DIPSS Plus risk categories.35 It is intuitive that targeting such cytokines may produce a clinical benefit in patients with MF.
Ruxolitinib has been shown to remarkably reduce
circulating proinflammatory cytokines, which has been
linked to its anti-JAK1 inhibitory activity. A correlation
between a reduction in the levels of proinflammatory
cytokines and palliation of constitutional symptoms has
been observed in clinical studies with ruxolitinib.17
Limitations of JAK2 Inhibitors for the
Treatment of MPNs
JAK2 inhibitors have proven very active at controlling
constitutional symptoms and reducing spleen size, 2
of the most clinically relevant manifestations in
patients with MF. However, their activity regarding
other aspects of MF is less impressive and, in some
cases, negligible.
Anemia

In addition to splenomegaly, anemia represents
one of the main reasons that prompt treatment initiation in patients with MF. It is important to note that
anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) has consistently been
considered to be a robust and independent prognostic
risk factor for survival in multiple prognostication
schemas for patients with MF, including the DIPSS
Plus scoring system. Anemia traditionally has been
managed with corticosteroids and/or androgens, transfusional
support,
or
erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents.36 However, the latter are only useful in a subset of patients who are not transfusion-dependent and
have serum erythropoietin levels < 125 U/L.37 Several
therapeutic approaches have shown some activity in
improving anemia in patients with MF, including corticosteroids and androgens.38,39 With such approaches,
anemia transiently improves in 20% of patients.21,22
Several immunomodulatory agents (eg, thalidomide,
lenalidomide, and pomalidomide) have been used in
patients with MF and have proven to be effective for
the management of anemia in a small percentage of
these individuals. For example, the combination of
lenalidomide with or without prednisone reportedly
produces clinical improvement of anemia in 19% to
30% of patients, respectively.23,24 Pomalidomide
induced responses in 25% of patients with anemia
who were receiving the drug alone at a dose of 2 mg/
day or in combination with prednisone at doses of

874

either 0.5 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg orally daily.40 A subsequent phase 2 study indicated that pomalidomide at a
dose of 0.5 mg/day induced anemia responses in
patients carrying the JAK2V617F mutation (24%) but
not in those with wild-type JAK2.41
Therapy with JAK2 inhibitors has not produced significant improvements in anemia and in fact they have
been associated with the induction of cytopenias. The initial ruxolitinib dose escalation study established a dose of
25 mg administered twice daily as the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD). It is interesting to note that the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was reversible grade 4 thrombocytopenia (NCI CTCAE v3), which occurred in 28% of
patients. This dose was associated with grade 3 to 4 toxicities (chiefly myelosuppression) in < 10% of cases.17 In a
phase 1/2 multicenter study of TG101348,18 59 patients
(44 with MF, 12 with post-PV MF, and 3 with post-ET
MF) were treated, including 31 in the dose confirmation
phase. Although the DLT was asymptomatic and reversible grade 3 to 4 hyperamylasemia, 70% of patients in the
MTD cohort required dose reduction during the first 6
cycles, due in 20% of cases to cytopenias because of rates
of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia of 10%, 27%, and 54%, respectively. Therefore, both
ruxolitinib and TG101348 are associated with cytopenias
and limited activity in improving anemia. However,
CYT387 has shown interesting activity in that regard in a
phase 1/2 study involving 60 patients with MF, 55% of
whom were transfusion-dependent at the time of study
entry.19 The MTD was established at a dose of 300 mg/
day. Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 27% of
patients but grade 3 anemia or neutropenia were reported
only in 7% and 5% of patients, respectively.19 Clinical
improvements in anemia (according to IWG-MRT criteria) occurred in 9 of 22 evaluable patients, which were
durable for a median of  2 months (range, 2 months to
12þ months). Preliminary results from a phase 1 study
with SB1518 indicate that this agent produces minimal
hematological toxicity in patients with MF.42 For that
reason, a phase 3 study with this JAK2 inhibitor is
planned for patients with MF with symptomatic splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. To our knowledge to
date, CYT387 is the only JAK2 inhibitor that has consistently improved anemia in patients with MF. If such findings are confirmed with longer follow-up, the mechanism
by which this agent improves anemia may be important
for the development of novel approaches for the treatment
of MF and perhaps for the management of other hematological conditions characterized by anemia.

JAK2 Inhibitors for MPNs/ Quintás-Cardama and Verstovsek

Reduction of the JAK2V617F Allele-Bearing Clones
and Bone Marrow Fibrosis

Animal studies have alerted clinicians regarding the
difficulty of completely eliminating JAK2V617F mutant
cells with JAK2 inhibitors. TG101348 attenuated the
clinical manifestations observed in a JAK2V617F knock-in
mouse model but could not eradicate the MPN-initiating
cell population.43 These results suggest that combination
strategies may be necessary to accomplish such a goal. The
levels of JAK2V617F allele burden have been monitored in
several studies of JAK2 inhibitors. The median baseline
JAK2V617F allele burden among patients carrying the
mutation was found to be 70%.17 Ruxolitinib induced an
average decrease in the mutant allele burden of only 11%
at 1 year and 18% at 2 years, which did not correlate with
clinical response.17 TG101348 induced a reduction in the
JAK2V617F allele burden from 60% at baseline to 32% after 12 cycles among patients with a baseline JAK2V617F allele burden > 20%.18 With limited follow-up, SB1518
has been reported to reduce the JAK2V617F allele burden
by 20% after 6 months of treatment.42 Thus, JAK2 inhibitors only induce modest reductions in the JAK2V617F allele burden, in stark contrast to their impressive
proapoptotic activity in vitro against JAK2V617F-positive
cells. The mechanisms underlying this discrepancy warrant investigation but protective signals emanating from
the bone marrow microenvironment may be implicated,
as recently suggested.44 In aggregate, these findings as well
as both experimental and clinical data indicate that JAK2
inhibitors will not cure patients with MPNs. To our
knowledge, to date, evidence suggests that they may not
even improve MF, although the available follow-up is too
short to draw definite conclusions in that regard. Similarly, given the short follow-up available, a clear reduction
in morbidity (most importantly thrombosis and hemorrhage) and mortality has not yet been established,
although current data appear to indicate that therapy with
the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib may prolong survival. A
longer follow-up in a randomized study is required to
confirm this early observation.
Should all patients with MPNs receive a JAK kinase
inhibitor? Although therapy with JAK2 inhibitors has rendered spectacular responses, particularly in patients with
MF, its use in patients with other MPNs must be must be
balanced against the morbidity and mortality associated
with such MPNs and the need for therapeutic intervention. Asymptomatic patients with low or intermediate-1
MF may be initially managed without MF-directed therapy. All others will likely require some form of therapy.

Cancer

Given the finding that standard therapy (outside the context of allogeneic SCT) has failed to prolong survival and
provides modest response rates, frontline therapy for
symptomatic patients with MF appears reasonable. The
use of these agents in patients with PV or ET is still on
tenuous footing. Ruxolitinib has been tested in a phase 2
study in patients with PV (n ¼ 34) or ET (n ¼ 39) that
was refractory or intolerant to hydroxyurea therapy.45
Among patients with PV, 59% received at least 6 months
of treatment and experienced marked reductions in hematocrit, WBC, and platelet counts, with complete and
partial response rates of 45% and 52%, respectively
according to the European LeukemiaNet response criteria.46 In patients with ET, ruxolitinib produced clinical
responses in the majority of patients, characterized by at
least a 50% reduction in pruritus, bone pain, night sweats,
and peripheral neuropathy scores. However, the complete
response rate was only 13%, with 77% of patients achieving a partial response. The most frequent side effects were
anemia (12% in patients with PV and 18% in patients
with ET, all grade 2) and leukopenia (9% in patients with
PV and 5% in patients with ET, all grade 3). Overall, ruxolitinib has shown activity in patients with ET or PV after
hydroxyurea failure or intolerance. Given the finding that
patients with ET or PV who receive standard therapy
enjoy life spans close (if not equal) to those of agematched healthy individuals and that JAK2 inhibitors
have yet to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival or survival free from thrombotic or hemorrhagic
complications, and in the absence of a randomized study,
the role of lifelong JAK2 kinase inhibition in these malignancies remains unknown. However, these agents are
likely to be of great benefit as second-line therapy given
the scarcity of effective therapeutic options in patients
who fail hydroxyurea therapy. However, this option must
be weighed against the emergent activity of pegylated
interferon-a-2a in patients with ET and PV.47,48 A
randomized phase 3 study testing the activity and safety of
ruxolitinib versus best available therapy for patients with
PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea is
currently underway (RESPONSE trial; NCT01243944).

CONCLUSIONS
Although hampered by a short follow-up, preliminary
data from clinical trials have shown without a doubt the
usefulness of JAK2 inhibitors for the treatment of patients
with MPNs. There is also a significant level of confidence
in predicting that these agents will not represent a curative

875

option for patients with these neoplasms. JAK2 inhibitors
induce remarkable reductions in spleen size and improve
the constitutional symptoms that characterize MF. However, little to no activity has been observed regarding the
reduction/elimination of bone marrow fibrosis/osteosclerosis, the reduction of the mutant JAK2V617F allele burden (perhaps with the exception of TG101348), or the
improvement of cytopenias (with the exception of
CYT387). Therefore, should, at the present time, JAK2
inhibitors be best considered as palliative therapies? Perhaps, but this label may change in the near future if, with
longer follow-up, they prove to be able to prolong survival. Although therapy with JAK2 inhibitors remains
investigational, recently completed phase 3 randomized,
placebo-controlled studies of ruxolitinib in patients with
MF may provide the foundation for the approval of these
agents for that disease. If this were to come to fruition,
ruxolitinib would become the first drug approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
MF. This important milestone should serve as a stepping
stone for the development of therapies for patients with
MPNs with curative potential. In this regard, the testing
of several JAK2 inhibitor-based combinatorial approaches
(eg, with hypomethylating agents, immunomodulatory
drugs, and histone deacetylase inhibitors) is currently
underway.
