Abstract
Several lines of evidence suggest that hypertension and
angiogenesis may be related phenomena but a functional link
remains elusive. Here, we propose that the renin-angiotensin
system (RAS), in addition to its central role in arterial
hypertension, also regulates blood vessel formation during
normal development and cancer. This mechanistic hypothesis
is based on reports of biochemical, genetic, clinical, and
epidemiologic data reviewed herein. Species differences
between the RAS of rodents and humans likely account for
why such a fundamental role in angiogenesis went unrecognized for so long. If proven correct, this hypothesis carries
many implications for the medical practices of cardiology,
oncology, and neonatology. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9112–5]

Introduction
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs are
among the most widely prescribed antihypertensive agents. ACE
inhibitors have shown particular efficacy in preventing adverse
cardiac events in high-risk individuals, treatment of patients with
congestive heart failure, and prevention of diabetic nephropathy.
However, it has also been recognized for several years that these
drugs are teratogenic when developing fetuses are subjected to
prolonged exposure during the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy (1). Congenital abnormalities associated with fetal
exposure to ACE inhibitors include neonatal renal failure,
oligohydramnios, and skeletal abnormalities, all of which were
presumably related to decreased amniotic fluid production (2),
with the proposed pathophysiology for these congenital abnormalities being attributed to reduction in fetal renal blood flow (3).
Because kidney development and urine production progress
gradually and occur predominantly during the later stages of
development (4), the major risk of congenital abnormalities due to
ACE inhibitors was believed to be present in the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy (5). However, in a retrospective analysis,
Cooper and colleagues (6) found that infants born to women who
took ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy had an
excess of major congenital malformations compared with unexposed women. No biological explanation was put forward to
explain such striking findings (6) and the molecular mechanism for
these observations was deemed unknown (7). Effects of ACE
inhibitors on the developing kidney do not account for congenital
abnormalities resulting from first-trimester exposure to ACE

inhibitors, and it is notable that in the study by Cooper and
colleagues (6), there was no significant increase in renal
abnormalities after ACE inhibitor exposure in the first trimester.
In contrast, there were highly significant increased risks of
developing malformations in the central nervous system (hazard
ratio, 4.39) and cardiovascular system (hazard ratio, 3.79; ref. 6).
As we will review herein, findings based on clinical studies and
further supported by data from preclinical studies suggest that the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an essential role in
developmental and pathologic blood vessel growth. These findings
support the notion that inhibition of blood vessel formation may
account for congenital abnormalities due to first-trimester ACE
inhibitor exposure. The developing brain and heart are major sites
of blood vessel formation (8), and the pattern of the recently
reported malformations due to first-trimester ACE inhibitor
exposure (4) is entirely consistent with impairment of vasculogenesis and early angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis
Blood vessels develop, expand, and diminish through a complex
cellular interplay (8). The initial assemblage of progenitor cells
(angioblasts) into a primary network of small blood vessels and into
the dorsal aorta and cardinal veins of the very young embryo is called
vasculogenesis. These blood vessels then remodel through growth,
migration, sprouting, and pruning to form a functional circulatory
system by a process called angiogenesis—a simple name that hides a
complex set of integrated chemical actions. For example, mouse
embryos lacking the cell receptor Flk1 (also called VEGFR-2) fail to
form vessels at all or, if its ligand VEGF-A is mutated, die with vessels
of severely reduced size. EphrinB2 is an early marker for arteries, and
its receptor, EphB4, for veins. In chicks, although not yet tested in
human embryos, some angioblasts already display neuropilin 1 [a
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor restricted at
subsequent stages to arteries], whereas others show neuropilin 2
(a receptor destined for veins). Remarkably, angioblasts with the
pertinent markers migrate to the positions of future arteries and
veins in advance of the onset of blood flow. In mammals, later stages
of developmental angiogenesis as well as physiologic angiogenesis in
the adult (wound healing, female reproductive cycling, and placenta
formation) and pathologic angiogenesis—cancer and several major
retinal and other diseases classifiable as ‘‘angiogenesis-dependent
diseases’’ (9)—share some molecular mechanisms with the earlier
vascular processes, but each also has unique biochemical features
(10). Such features should, in principle, allow them to be individually
targeted for therapeutic purposes.

unappreciated, regulator of developmental and pathologic

angiogenesis (Fig. 1). Over the past several years, extensive work
from our group and others has uncovered proangiogenic roles of
peptidases responsible for the downstream cleavage of angiotensin
II to functionally active smaller proteins. The membraneassociated protease aminopeptidase A (APA; EC 3.4.11.7), a
homodimeric type II membrane-spanning cell surface constituent
that is expressed on vascular endothelial cells throughout the
body, has only one well-defined role: cleaving the NH2-terminal
aspartate residue of the 8–amino acid angiotensin molecule to the
7–amino acid angiotensin III (Fig. 1; ref. 11). Angiotensin III has
high affinity for angiotensin type I and type II receptors and shares
many of the physiologic functions of angiotensin II in the
cardiovascular system and in promoting production of chemokines and growth factors (12). We have shown that APA is upregulated and enzymatically activated in the vascular endothelium
of human tumors (13) and that mice lacking APA fail to mount the
expected angiogenic response to hypoxia or growth factors (14).
Furthermore, inhibitory peptides or monoclonal antibodies that
block APA activity also potently inhibit angiogenesis in tumors
(14) and in hypoxia-related pathologic angiogenesis in postnatal
developing retina (15). These findings indicate that, like angiotensin II, angiotensin III also possesses proangiogenic activity.

Another agent, the membrane-bound zinc-dependent peptidase,
aminopeptidase N (APN; CD13; EC 3.4.11.2), expressed in various
epithelial cells and in macrophages, removes the NH2-terminal
arginine residue of angiotensin III to form the 6–amino acid
angiotensin IV (Fig. 1). Angiotensin IV, unlike angiotensin II or III,
does not bind with high affinity to the angiotensin type I or type II
receptors but instead seems to bind to the recently characterized
AT4 receptor. Notably, stimulation of the AT4 receptor strongly
promotes endothelial cell growth, suggesting that angiotensin IV
also possesses proangiogenic activity. We have shown that APN is
highly expressed on tumor blood vessels and on other vessels
undergoing pathologic angiogenesis, and have shown that APN
antagonists are antiangiogenic in vivo (16). We have also generated
APN-null mice genetically by homologous recombination and
found that these mice are structurally and physiologically normal
and can undergo physiologic angiogenesis but show a severely
impaired angiogenic response under pathologic conditions (17).
These biochemical and genetic lines of evidence indicate that
peptides derived from the downstream cleavage of individual
amino acids from angiotensinogen promote angiogenesis in a
variety of settings and that inhibition of any of several peptidases
within the RAS inhibits new blood vessel growth.

Figure 1. The role of the RAS in angiogenesis. Renin, produced primarily by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of circulating
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Blockade of downstream aminopeptidases involved in the further sequential proteolytic processing of the angiotensins also
inhibits angiogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for the major congenital malformations seen in infants exposed to ACE inhibitors in the first trimester of pregnancy.
In addition to the pharmacologic inhibition of the aminopeptidases (14, 16) depicted here, the genetic elimination of either APA (14) or APN (17) also results in severe
angiogenesis impairment in mice. *, antiangiogenic agent; #, antihypertensive agent.

VEGF as an Effector of Angiogenesis of the RAS
The angiotensin receptors are classic seven-transmembrane
domain G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR). With a few notable
exceptions (such as the thrombin receptor), GPCRs have not been
implicated as direct modulators of angiogenesis but instead act
indirectly to enhance blood vessel development and growth.
Activation of angiotensin II receptors by peptides derived from
RAS leads to potent induction of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; refs. 18–20). The VEGF/VEGF receptor system plays a central
role in vasculogenesis in embryonic development and in adult life
(21). Enhanced VEGF production due to angiotensin II may be
largely due to a potent angiotensin-dependent stabilization of the
transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a; ref. 22)
through a recently characterized mechanism involving production
of reactive oxygen species (23). Activation of angiotensin receptors
also enhances transcription of HIF-1a via a protein kinase C–
dependent mechanism (24). In addition to the effects on VEGF
production, angiotensin II has been shown to enhance expression of
the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk1 in a model of cultured endothelial cells
(25), which may further amplify angiotensin-mediated angiogenesis.

Effects of Drug Inhibitors of Angiotensin Signaling
on Tumor Angiogenesis
The proangiogenic effects of angiotensin described above
provide mechanistic support to the notion that pharmacologic
blockade of angiotensin signaling may interfere with tumor
angiogenesis (26). In support of this approach are studies of
human tumors that correlated the extent of angiotensin receptor
expression with tumor VEGF expression, tumor angiogenesis, and/
or tumor invasiveness (27–29). Emerging data suggest that in
addition to systemically produced angiotensin, the tumor
environment contains all of the necessary components of the
RAS to produce angiotensin locally and contribute importantly
to tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression (26, 29, 30), further
implicating the RAS as a molecular mediator of tumor
angiogenesis. Indeed, studies in mouse models show that
captopril and other ACE inhibitors reduce tumor growth in
mouse models by blocking angiogenesis (31, 32). In these
experimental models, ACE inhibitor administration is associated
with a profound decrease in circulating levels of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a finding consistent with the
established ability of angiotensin II to enhance VEGF production
by endothelial cells (23) and vascular pericytes (33). Further
confirmation comes from recent findings showing that drugs that
directly inhibit function of angiotensin receptors inhibit tumor
angiogenesis and cancer growth in vivo (34–36). Intriguingly, and
consistent with the findings in preclinical models, a retrospective
cohort analysis of patients in an antihypertensive agent trial
revealed a decreased cancer incidence in patients on ACE
inhibitor drugs (37), suggesting that long-term use of ACE
inhibitors may protect against cancer and that the antiangiogenic
properties of these agents may have substantial clinical relevance
(20, 38). More recently, long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors
or angiotensin receptor blockers was shown to decrease cancer
incidence in individuals with ACE gene polymorphisms associated
with elevated serum ACE levels (39).

RAS Knockout Mice and the Thalidomide Paradox
In light of the excess congenital abnormalities seen in human
fetuses exposed to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester, when

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

blood vessel formation is of major importance, one might predict
that animals lacking ACE would also possess profound congenital
abnormalities. Yet, mice lacking ACE show no evidence of
congenital abnormalities such as those seen in human fetuses
exposed to ACE inhibitors (40). Similarly, our group has shown that
mice genetically lacking either APA or APN show no overt evidence
of congenital abnormalities (14, 17). However, the paucity of
developmental abnormalities in rodents lacking ACE does not
preclude the possibility that ACE inhibition causes developmental
abnormalities by inhibiting early vessel formation in humans. It is
well established that rodents exposed to the antiangiogenic agent
thalidomide show no developmental abnormalities, yet humans
are highly sensitive to its teratogenic effects (41). The sensitivity
of humans to blood vessel inhibitors during the first trimester
of pregnancy suggests either a more refined regulation of the
developing vascular endothelium in humans or a greater redundancy of effective vasculogenic and angiogenic agents in rodents.

Open Questions
Despite the significant amount of data outlined above in support
of the hypothesis that the RAS is an important regulator of
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, the precise roles of the different
constituents of this system remain poorly understood. By use of
standard knockout and back-crossing technology, mouse models
can be engineered in which several of the enzymes regulating
conversion of angiotensin to its downstream peptides can be
eliminated; for instance, study of double-null mice (i.e., APA / /
APN / ) or triple-null mice (i.e., ACE / /APA / /APN / ) may
clarify mechanisms of developmental abnormalities due to
impaired angiogenesis. Because complete and specific pharmacologic blockade of angiotensin-associated peptidases may also be
required to understand fully the developmental abnormalities
caused by impaired angiogenesis that this hypothesis would
predict, one may have to seek new peptidase inhibitors (42).
Moreover, the findings that biochemical or genetic interference
with components of the RAS inhibits angiogenesis in experimental
models (14–17, 31) fit well with the intriguing (and almost decade
old) epidemiologic data showing that ACE inhibitors are associated
with decreased incidence of human cancer (37); in their seminal
‘‘hypothesis-generating’’ Lancet report, Lever and colleagues (37)
left open the question of molecular mechanism. We feel that the
time has come for tumor vascular targeting and angiogenesis
inhibition to be strongly considered as therapeutic factors to
exploit (43). The relative expression of receptors of the angiotensin
system within vascular endothelium in different tumors and at
varying stages of carcinogenesis, although still poorly understood,
is clearly relevant to the putative role of angiotensins in promoting
tumor angiogenesis.
Manipulation of the RAS may be an important tactic particularly
for the treatment of markedly angiogenic tumors. Ideally,
disruption of the RAS through new agents that selectively inhibit
ACE or other peptidases within the RAS may not only prevent
cancer (37, 39) but could also conceivably augment the efficacy of
established chemotherapeutic agents. Because the safety profile of
ACE inhibitors (outside of pregnancy settings) is well established,
and because hypertension is a fairly common side effect of many
cancer therapeutic agents, addition of ACE and/or other peptidase
inhibitors to selected therapeutic cancer regimens would perhaps
serve ‘‘double duty’’ by simultaneously providing inhibition of
tumor angiogenesis and beneficial effects on the cardiovascular

system. Ultimately, detailed mechanistic exploration of the role of
the RAS in mediating developmental and pathologic angiogenesis
may establish an as yet unrecognized connection between arterial
hypertension and tumor angiogenesis and, if so, will provide fertile
ground for translational research in cardiology, oncology, and
neonatology.
