and fibrotic tumor stroma presents a problem in terms of drug
penetration, and thereby efficacy. In light of these findings, the
tumor stromal compartment is an exciting and largely unchartered
territory for exploring novel strategies to treat cancer.
A number of studies show the importance of platelet-derived
growth factors (PDGF) for the recruitment and phenotypic character
of the tumor stroma. Indeed, ectopic expression of PDGFB in
immortalized but nontumorigenic keratinocytes is sufficient to
confer tumorigenic potential through the formation of a rich stroma
characterized by mesenchymal cell proliferation and angiogenesis
(11). In addition, PDGF-BB induces the formation of a prominent
and growth-promoting stroma in xenograft studies of melanoma
(12). Furthermore, paracrine signaling by tumor cell–derived PDGFAA was identified as a major driving force in the recruitment of
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in xenograft studies of breast
and lung carcinoma (13, 14). Lastly, tumor cells that were
experimentally deprived of their ability to produce vascular
endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were found to compensate
by secreting PDGF-AA to attract stromal fibroblasts, which in turn
provided VEGF-A to stimulate angiogenesis (15). The functional
importance of tumor cell expression of the PDGF ligands PDGFC
and PDGFD is, however, less well known. Ectopic expression of
PDGFD enhances tumor growth both through direct growth
stimulatory effects and through promotion of angiogenesis and
pericyte recruitment (16, 17). In addition, transgenic expression of
PDGFC in the mouse liver results in tissue fibrosis and subsequent
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (18).
Despite the fact that many human tumors secrete PDGF ligands
and display expression of PDGF receptors on various stromal cell
populations such as CAFs and pericytes (19), the molecular details
of the tumor growth–promoting effects of paracrine PDGF
signaling are not well understood. Prompted by findings of
prominent expression of PDGF-CC by many common skin cancers,
including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell
carcinoma, in contrast to the corresponding normal skin, we set out
to investigate the phenotypic significance of PDGFC expression
and to molecularly define the role for PDGF-CC in maintaining a
growth-promoting tumor microenvironment.

Abstract
Cancer results from the concerted performance of malignant
cells and stromal cells. Cell types populating the microenvironment are enlisted by the tumor to secrete a host of
growth-promoting cues, thus upholding tumor initiation and
progression. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) support
the formation of a prominent tumor stromal compartment by
as of yet unidentified molecular effectors. Whereas PDGF-CC
induces fibroblast reactivity and fibrosis in a range of tissues,
little is known about the function of PDGF-CC in shaping the
tumor-stroma interplay. Herein, we present evidence for a
paracrine signaling network involving PDGF-CC and PDGF
receptor-A in malignant melanoma. Expression of PDGFC in
a mouse model accelerated tumor growth through recruitment and activation of different subsets of cancer-associated
fibroblasts. In seeking the molecular identity of the supporting
factors provided by cancer-associated fibroblasts, we made
use of antibody arrays and an in vivo coinjection model to
identify osteopontin as the effector of the augmented tumor
growth induced by PDGF-CC. In conclusion, we establish
paracrine signaling by PDGF-CC as a potential drug target to
reduce stromal support in malignant melanoma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cancer has traditionally been studied from the viewpoint of the
tumor cell. However, the notion of the tumor as an organ in its own
right is gaining acceptance. Recent studies have highlighted a
carefully orchestrated and intricate interplay between transformed
and genetically unstable tumor cells with local or bone marrow–
derived ostensibly normal cells (1). Indeed, certain cancers, such as
breast carcinomas and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, display
prominent stromal compartments comprising a large fraction of
the tumor volume (2, 3). The reactive tumor stroma is
characterized by expansion and activation of the fibroblast
population, excessive production of extracellular matrix, and
persistent inflammation (4–6). The functional importance of cell
types in the tumor stroma is highlighted by studies showing a
higher growth rate of the same tumor transplanted into mice
deficient for Trp53 compared with wild-type (wt) mice (7). Gross
phenotypic changes in terms of gene expression, and even genetic
alterations, have been described in tumor stromal cells compared
with their normal counterparts (8–10). In addition, an expanded

Skin tumor tissue array. The human skin tumor and normal tissue
array (Tissue Array Network, BC21011) was immunostained for PDGF-CC as
described (20) and for PDGF receptor-a (PDGFR-a; 1:40, Cell Signaling) as
described below.
Generation of cell lines stably expressing PDGFC. Full-length mouse
PDGFC cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector to generate the PDGFC
expression plasmid. For generation of stably expressing cell lines, B16/F10
cells were transfected with the PDGF-C plasmid (B16/PDGF-C) or empty
vector (B16/mock); 72 h post transfection, 500 Ag/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen)
was added to the cultures for selection of resistant mass cultures.

Tissue preparation, histology, and immunostaining. Mice were
perfused with PBS followed by 2% paraformaldehyde. For paraffin
embedding, tumors were postfixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4jC
overnight. For cryopreservation, tumors were kept in 30% sucrose at 4jC
overnight, followed by embedding in cryosectioning medium.
Frozen sections were air-dried and fixed in cold acetone for 10 min.
Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized followed by quenching of
endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at room
temperature. Antigen retrieval was done using 0.25 mg/mL trypsin
diluted in PBS at 37jC for 30 min (TUNEL) or 20 min (PDGFR-a) or with
0.5 mg/mL trypsin for 5 min (CD31 and NG2), followed by boiling in
10 mmol/L citric acid pH 6.0 for 20 min [bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd),
PDGFR-a, fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1), F4/80, and osteopontin].
Antibodies and dilutions used were TUNEL according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche), PDGFR-a (2 Ag/mL; R&D Systems), CD31 (0.16 Ag/mL;
BD Biosciences), BrdUrd according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Labeling and Detection Kit II, Roche), NG2 (1:200, Chemicon), FSP-1
(1:300), F4/80 (1:50, BD Biosciences), and osteopontin (1:100, R&D Systems).
Appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
were applied followed by amplification using the Vectastain ABC system
(Vector Laboratories). For immunofluorescence, fluorochrome-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used and sections were mounted
using media containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories), where appropriate.
Picrosirius red staining was done according to standard protocol using
1% Direct Red 80 diluted in picric acid (Fluka).

For propagation, these cell lines were kept under continuous selection
(250 Ag/mL). The mass culture was tested for PDGF-CC expression by
immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody generated in-house.
Receptor stimulation and immunoprecipitation. B16/mock,
B16/PDGF-C, and porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing
PDGFR-a (a-PAE) were stimulated with 100 ng/mL core PDGF-CC for
1 h on ice. Immunoprecipitation was done with PDGFR-a rabbit
antiserum (LICR, Uppsala Branch), an antibody against osteopontin
(R&D Systems), or a pool of antibodies against fibroblast growth factor-2
(FGF-2; Chemicon, Advanced Targeting Systems, and Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and Western blot analysis was done with 1 Ag/mL
antibody against phospho-tyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), osteopontin, PDGF-CC, or FGF-2, respectively.
In vitro proliferation assay. Fifteen thousand B16/mock or B16/PDGFC cells were seeded in triplicates in 12-well plates. Cells were subsequently
counted using a Beckman Coulter Z2 particle counter 24, 48, and 72 h after
seeding.
Animal care and tumor establishment. All animal experiments
were approved by the local committee for animal experiments. To establish
B16/mock and B16/PDGF-C tumors, 2  106 cells were injected s.c. in the
dorsal left flank into young C57Bl/6J mice. For coinjection studies, C57Bl/6J
severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected with 5  105 B16
cells, wt mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), or MEFs from osteopontindeficient mice (21), alone or in combination at a 1:1 ratio. Tumors were
considered as established when larger than 1  1 mm. Tumor volume was
calculated as p/6  length  width2.

Array C series 1000.1) were used according to provided instructions. A
total of 500 Ag of pooled protein lysate from three different B16/mock or

cancers, we made use of tissue arrays composed of normal skin and
a large selection of samples from a variety of skin cancers,
including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell
carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining for PDGF-CC revealed
prominent expression by the tumor cell compartment in malignant
specimens, whereas PDGF-CC was exclusively expressed in hair
follicles of corresponding normal skin (Fig. 1A). In particular,
production of PDGF-CC by tumor cells was noted in malignant
melanomas (Fig. 1A), prompting us to further study the role of
PDGF-CC in the development of this disease. To localize cell types
expressing the receptor for PDGF-CC (i.e., PDGFR-a) in human
melanomas, we performed immunostaining of identical tissue
arrays. As detailed in Fig. 1A, normal skin exhibited only very weak
staining for PDGFR-a. In contrast, we found abundant expression
of PDGFR-a in cells histologically and morphologically identified as
fibroblasts populating the stromal compartment of malignant
melanoma (Fig. 1A). Thus, we have identified PDGF ligand and
receptor expression as an apparent feature of a subset of human
malignant melanoma.

volume of 410 F 109 mm3, whereas mice with B16/mock tumors
displayed a significantly smaller average tumor volume of 122 F
36 mm3 (P < 0.05, Student’s t test). The growth-promoting effects of
PDGF-CC on B16 tumors were further confirmed using an
independently established mass culture of B16/PDGF-C cells
(data not shown).
Next, we sought to assess the general effects of PDGFC
expression on tumor growth characteristics. Quantitation of tumor
cell proliferation by incorporation of BrdUrd revealed that B16/
PDGF-C tumor cells exhibited a 1.6-fold higher rate of proliferation
compared with B16/mock cells (Fig. 2A; P < 0.001, Student’s t test).
Moreover, analysis of tumor cell apoptotic rate using TUNEL
staining showed that B16/PDGF-C tumor cells were 1.9-fold less
prone to undergo apoptosis compared with B16/mock cells
(Fig. 2B; P < 0.05, Student’s t test). Because various PDGF isoforms
are known to stimulate angiogenesis, either by direct or indirect
mechanisms, we investigated the angiogenic phenotype in B16/
PDGF-C and B16/mock tumors. B16/PDGF-C tumors displayed a
significantly higher blood vessel density compared with B16/mock
tumors, as assessed by immunostaining for the endothelial cell
marker CD31 (Fig. 2C; P < 0.05, Student’s t test). However, as judged
by pericyte coverage and by morphologic criteria, no difference was
found in the degree of maturation or in the gross anatomy of the
vascular tree in the two different cohorts of B16 tumors (Fig. 2D

PDGF-CC/PDGFR-a signaling, we made use of the B16 mouse
model of melanoma. B16 tumors display a thin fibrous capsule
surrounding the tumor parenchyma but a relative lack of
infiltrating stroma (data not shown), making it a suitable model
with high sensitivity to determine the effects of paracrine PDGF-CC
signaling. To investigate the functional significance of expression of
PDGFC by tumor cells, we therefore transfected B16 cells with a
vector containing the cDNA for full-length mouse PDGFC or with
empty vector (B16/PDGF-C and B16/mock, respectively). RT-PCR
analysis and immunostaining confirmed expression of PDGFC
transcript and PDGF-CC protein by B16/PDGF-C cells, but not by
B16/mock cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Whereas exceedingly
low expression levels of PDGFR-a were detected by quantitative
RT-PCR (data not shown), we were unable to detect activated
PDGFR-a following stimulation of either B16/mock or B16/PDGFC cells with PDGF-CC (Fig. 1C). Importantly, B16/PDGF-C cells
did not display an altered growth rate in vitro compared with
B16/mock cells (Fig. 1D, left), indicating that B16 tumors are not
intrinsically dependent on the PDGF/PDGFR system for autocrine
growth stimulation, consistent with earlier reports (17). In contrast,
when injected into syngeneic C57Bl/6J mice, B16/PDGF-C tumors
exhibited a dramatically accelerated growth rate compared with
B16/mock tumors (Fig. 1D, right). At the completion of the study,
mice with B16/PDGF-C tumors presented with an average tumor

ing FSP-1 were prevalent throughout B16/PDGF-C tumors (Fig. 3B,
top). Interestingly, the recruitment of FSP-1+ cells into B16 tumors
was dependent on activation of PDGFR-a because analysis of
tumors derived from B16 cells transfected with PDGFB (17), a
PDGFR-h ligand, revealed a comparable lack of infiltrating stromal
fibroblasts expressing FSP-1 (Fig. 3B, top). Consistent with the
notion that signaling by PDGFR-a is crucial for the recruitment
and phenotype of fibroblasts, coexpression analysis of PDGFR-a
and FSP-1 revealed three different populations of infiltrating
stromal fibroblasts (Fig. 3B, bottom). On the edge of B16/PDGF-C
tumors, a population of cells with high expression of PDGFR-a, as
assessed by expression of GFP, but lacking expression of FSP-1, was
apparent (designated PDGFR-ahigh; Fig. 3B, bottom, arrows). Second,
a significant proportion of cells expressing PDGFR-a, albeit at lower
levels, in the surrounding fibrous capsule and on the edge of
tumors, also produced FSP-1 (designated PDGFR-alow/FSP-1;
Fig. 3B, bottom, arrowheads). Finally, a third population of stromal
fibroblasts exclusively expressing FSP-1, but not PDGFR-a, resided
in the center of B16/PDGF-C tumors but not in B16/mock tumors
(designated FSP-1; Fig. 3B, bottom, stars). In addition, all three
fibroblast populations expressed the myofibroblast marker
a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) to various degrees, indicating
that they are indeed CAFs (data not shown). To further substantiate
an increased presence of stromal fibroblasts in B16/PDGF-C tumors
compared with B16/mock tumors, we performed picrosirius red
staining for the presence of interstitial collagen, as fibroblasts are the
main producers of collagen-I. Whereas B16/mock tumors mainly
exhibited deposits of collagen in the surrounding capsule,
B16/PDGF-C tumors displayed large streaks of collagen deposits
invading into the tumor mass (Fig. 3C), indicative of an increased

and data not shown). We conclude that B16/PDGF-C tumors
exhibited a faster growth rate due to an increased rate of
proliferation and a decreased rate of apoptosis, most likely
consequential to an enhanced angiogenic response.
PDGF-CC induces the recruitment of CAFs into tumors.
Because B16 cells did not express significant levels of PDGFR-a or
exhibit growth stimulation consequential to PDGFC expression
(Fig. 1C and D), we analyzed B16/PDGF-C tumors for possible
paracrine interactions involving tumor cell–derived PDGF-CC and
the stromal compartment. First, we assessed the presence of cells
expressing PDGFR-a by immunostaining. The fibrous capsule
surrounding B16 tumors consisted predominantly of cells morphologically identified as fibroblasts with prominent expression of
PDGFR-a (Fig. 3A, top). Whereas the fibrous capsule was thin and
sharply defined in B16/mock tumors, B16/PDGF-C tumors
displayed a thicker capsule with a diffuse border with the tumor
parenchyma (Fig. 3A, top). To enable easier visualization of cells
expressing PDGFR-a, we made use of knock-in mice in which a
nuclearly targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct was
substituted for one of the PDGFR-a alleles (PDGFR-a/GFP; ref. 22).
B16/PDGF-C and B16/mock cells were injected into PDGFR-a/GFP
mice and allowed to form tumors, which were excised and
analyzed for their content of cells expressing GFP. As shown in
Fig. 3A (bottom), whereas B16/mock tumors and the center
of B16/PDGF-C tumors were devoid of cells expressing PDGFR-a,
the edge of B16/PDGF-C tumors displayed a substantial infiltration
of PDGFR-a/GFP+ cells. To establish the identity of the PDGFR-a+
cells infiltrating the B16/PDGF-C tumors, we performed immunostaining for the fibroblast marker FSP-1 (S100A4). In contrast to
B16/mock tumors, which were devoid of fibroblasts, cells express-

factor (23). Moreover, B16/PDGF-C tumor lysates contained a
significantly higher concentration of osteopontin (SPP1), a soluble
extracellular matrix protein with known effector functions in
tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. As assessed by
densitometric quantitation of two independent hybridizations of
the antibody arrays, FGF-2 and osteopontin were present at 1.4and 2-fold higher abundance, respectively, in lysates from B16/
PDGF-C tumors compared with B16/mock tumors (Fig. 4A). The
increased presence of PDGF-CC, FGF-2, and osteopontin in B16/
PDGF-C tumor lysates was further validated by an immunoprecipitation and Western blot strategy using materials from three
independent B16/PDGF-C and B16/mock tumors. The results
corroborated an increased expression of PDGF-CC, as expected,
and a dramatically increased presence of both FGF-2 and
osteopontin in lysates from B16/PDGF-C compared with B16/
mock tumors (Fig. 4B). To exclude the possibility that intrinsic
differences in B16/PDGF-C and B16/mock cells accounted for the
augmented secretion of FGF-2 and osteopontin, we performed
quantitative RT-PCR analyses of RNA isolated from B16/PDGF-C
and B16/mock cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, expression of neither
FGF-2 nor osteopontin by B16 cells was increased following
transfection of PDGFC, indicating that the higher production of

fibroblast presence within the tumor. Additionally, interstitial
collagen between the tumor cells was found to be moderately
increased in B16/PDGFC tumors (data not shown).
To investigate whether PDGFR-a designated a population of
macrophages, a cell type reported to express PDGFRs on activation,
we performed immunostaining for the macrophage marker F4/80.
As seen in Fig. 3D, macrophages were prevalent to a similar degree
in necrotic areas of both B16/mock and B16/PDGF-C tumors,
indicating that macrophages are not recruited into tumors by
secretion of PDGF-CC by B16 cells.
PDGF-CC induces production of tumor growth–promoting
factors. Having documented that ectopic expression of PDGFC in
B16 melanoma cells accelerated tumor growth and recruited
distinct populations of stromal fibroblasts into tumors, we sought
to identify the molecular identity of the tumor growth–promoting
factors supplied by the CAFs. We made use of antibody arrays to
simultaneously and quantitatively probe the abundance of 96
different secreted growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and
transmembrane receptors in pools of lysates from B16/PDGF-C
tumors compared with B16/mock tumors. In agreement with our
recent studies, paracrine signaling by PDGF was found to stimulate
the secretion of FGF-2 (basic FGF), a prototypical angiogenic

Thus, we conclude that PDGF-CC enhances the growth of B16
tumors by recruitment of CAFs that secrete osteopontin.

FGF-2 and osteopontin in whole tumor lysates was the result of
paracrine signaling events induced by PDGF-CC.
Osteopontin is produced by CAFs in B16/PDGF-C tumors
and confers growth-stimulatory functions. We decided to focus
our efforts on the regulation, expression, and functional significance of osteopontin by stromal fibroblasts in B16/PDGF-C
tumors. To determine which cell type within B16 tumors was
responsible for the expression of osteopontin, we performed
immunostainings. Osteopontin was found to be expressed by cells
populating the fibrous capsule surrounding the tumor and by
single cells infiltrating B16/PDGF-C tumors (Fig. 5A). Coimmunostaining analysis revealed that most cells producing osteopontin
in the tumor capsule were of the PDGFR-alow/FSP-1 class of
CAFs, as they expressed all three proteins (Fig. 5B, arrowheads),
although a subset of fibroblasts resident in the tumor capsule of
the FSP-1 class also produced osteopontin (Fig. 5B, stars). The
majority of osteopontin-producing cells within the tumor parenchyma were of the FSP-1 class, as they did not express PDGFR-a
(Fig. 5B, stars). Thus, we conclude that osteopontin is predominantly expressed by CAFs in B16/PDGF-C tumors. Furthermore, we
stimulated cultured fibroblasts with PDGF-CC and assessed
expression of osteopontin. As detailed in Fig. 5C, fibroblasts
expressed high amounts of osteopontin, and stimulation with
PDGF-CC for 6 hours increased the production even further, by
2.4-fold compared with unstimulated fibroblasts, showing that the
expression of osteopontin is directly regulated by signaling induced
by PDGF-CC in fibroblasts.
Finally, we sought to assess the functional significance of the
expression of osteopontin by CAFs. To this end, we established a
coinjection model of B16 melanoma cells with MEFs in C57Bl/6J
severe combined immunodeficient mice. MEFs isolated from wt
mice (wt MEFs; ref. 21) were coinjected with B16 melanoma cells at
a ratio of 1:1. As shown in Fig. 5D, wt MEFs reduced the latency of
B16 tumors from 10 F 1.5 to 8.2 F 1.2 days (P < 0.01, Student’s
t test). Moreover, wt MEFs conferred a significant growth
advantage to established B16 tumors (Fig. 5D; P < 0.05, Student’s
t test). In contrast, MEFs isolated from osteopontin-deficient mice
(21) and coinjected with B16 melanoma cells neither affected the
latency of tumors (9.8 F 1.8 days) nor accelerated the growth of
established tumors (Fig. 5D), indicating that osteopontin supplied
by CAFs is functionally important for the growth of B16 tumors.

Discussion
Herein we present evidence for a paracrine signaling circuitry
involving tumor cell–derived PDGF-CC signaling to PDGFR-a
expressed by stromal fibroblasts in human skin malignancies. We
further show a functional significance of paracrine PDGF-CC
signaling in the recruitment of CAFs into experimental mouse
melanoma, thereby augmenting both tumor growth and angiogenesis (Fig. 6). The molecular effectors of the promotion of
tumorigenesis were identified as the prototypical angiogenic factor
FGF-2 and the diffusible extracellular matrix protein osteopontin
(Fig. 6). Accordingly, fibroblast-supported tumor growth was
dependent on expression of osteopontin in coinjection studies.
Hence, we have revealed a paracrine signaling network involving
PDGF-CC that serves to regulate the recruitment and phenotype of
CAFs into tumors and which is readily available for therapeutic
intervention (Fig. 6).
Recruitment of CAFs into tumors. CAFs are known to
modulate tumorigenic properties of neoplastic cells, including
proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (6). Experiments involving coinjection of fibroblasts of different origin and tumor cells
show that, in contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs promote tumor
growth (5). Moreover, recent studies have revealed extensive
changes in the phenotype, and even the genotype, of CAFs
compared with their normal counterparts (9, 10). However, the
source for recruitment of stromal fibroblasts into tumors has not
been clearly defined yet. Whereas local, resident fibroblasts are in
many cases abundant and the most likely pool for recruitment,
there is also evidence suggesting that bone marrow–derived
mesenchymal stem cells are recruited into experimental tumors
(24). There is abundant evidence that PDGF-CC induces fibrosis in
a range of tissues, including liver, kidney, and heart (18, 25, 26). Our
studies reveal that expression of PDGFC by tumor cells serves to
engage fibroblasts also in the malignant process. Interestingly, the
recruited fibroblasts were of different subtypes, as defined by their
expression of PDGFR-a, FSP-1, and a-SMA. Paradoxically, not all
of the CAF subtypes displayed PDGFR-a at readily detectable
levels, expression of which would have been assumed to be
required for recruitment by PDGF-CC. In addition, a majority of the

expression by tumor cells. Malignant cells (dark gray)
produce PDGF-CC that signals in a paracrine manner to
recruit fibroblasts (light gray ), thereby promoting the
formation of a thicker fibrous capsule surrounding the
tumor and the migration of fibroblasts into the tumor
mass. CAFs produce osteopontin and FGF-2, which in
turn exert tumor growth stimulatory and proangiogenic
effects (endothelial cells are colored white).

proteins are known to bind osteopontin, including CD44 and av, a5,
h1, and h3 integrins, the exact signaling receptor(s) for the various
functions of osteopontin is not known. In agreement with our
finding of osteopontin as a growth-stimulatory factor for mouse
melanoma, osteopontin was identified by molecular profiling as a
progression marker for human melanomas (38). Furthermore, in a
recent study, osteopontin was part of a 26-gene expression profile
with potent predictive power for good or bad prognosis of breast
cancer patients (39). High expression of osteopontin corresponded
to a bad prognosis for recurrence of metastatic breast cancer,
suggestive of functional importance also in other cancers than
melanoma.
Further evidence for a role for CAF-derived osteopontin in tumor
biology comes from a study in which PDGFR-a+ CAFs were isolated
from a transgenic mouse model of squamous cell carcinoma of the
skin. In contrast to fibroblasts isolated from nontransgenic
littermates, PDGFR-a+ CAFs from K14-HPV16 mice expressed
abundant levels of osteopontin.5 In addition, in agreement with our
studies, and with the notion that the tumor stroma is in many
aspects similar to a wound that does not heal (40), an analogous
situation was recently described for skin wound healing, during
which macrophage-derived PDGF(s) induced production of osteopontin by reactive fibroblasts (41). In this context, osteopontin
hindered wound healing and induced excessive fibrosis. Taken
together with our data, osteopontin seems to be of particular
importance for various aspects of skin pathology, begging the
question whether fibroblast-derived osteopontin constitutes a
general therapeutic target for skin malignancies, a question that
deserves further studies. Osteopontin was recently also identified
as a factor necessary for systemic instigation of indolent tumors by
activating and recruiting bone marrow–derived cells (42). Whether
osteopontin in addition serves to directly regulate the recruitment
and phenotype of CAFs remains to be studied. However, mice
deficient for osteopontin display fewer interstitial fibroblasts in a
mouse model of renal fibrosis (43).
Therapeutic targeting of CAFs. The notion of targeting CAFs to
inhibit tumor growth and progression is attractive due to the
increasing identification of stimulatory factors derived from the
tumor stroma. Targeting of stromal fibroblast effector functions by
drugs inhibiting the action of osteopontin, FGF-2, CXCL12,
CXCL14, and many more, singularly or in combination, holds
promise of producing therapeutic efficacy. In addition, approaches
to prevent the recruitment and phenotypic conversion of CAFs are
highly warranted. Based on our studies, as well as earlier work
(14, 15, 23), we propose antagonism of paracrine signaling by
PDGF-CC and PDGFR-a as one such strategy. Recent genetic
evidence supports a functional role for epithelial-mesenchymal
cross talk directed by PDGFR-a during the embryonal development
of the palate (44). We speculate that pharmacologic disruption of
such signaling may be fruitful also in treating various types of
cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors incorporating action against the
PDGFRs, such as imatinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib, are already in
clinical use with demonstrable efficacy (45). Consistent with this
idea, treatment with imatinib attenuates fibroblast support and
tumor growth in mouse models of cervical carcinoma and PDGFCC–induced hepatocellular carcinoma (23, 46). However, in a small
phase II trial, where 16 evaluable patients with metastatic

fibroblasts within the tumor parenchyma that expressed the
growth-stimulatory protein osteopontin expressed FSP-1, but not
PDGFR-a. We speculate that a progenitor population of stromal
fibroblasts, which express high levels of PDGFR-a, are recruited
and expanded by tumor-derived PDGF-CC and subsequently
educated by the tumor microenvironment into mature and tumor
growth–promoting CAFs, denoted by the activated fibroblast
markers FSP-1 and a-SMA. Interestingly, a similar role has been
described for PDGFR-h in determining pericyte fate, that is,
PDGFR-h denotes a progenitor population of pericytes that is
recruited to tumor blood vessels and subsequently differentiated
into fully mature pericytes distinguished by expression of NG2,
desmin, and a-SMA, while losing expression of PDGFR-h (27).
Intriguingly, PDGFR-a is a marker for mesenchymal stem cells (28),
and PDGF-CC has been identified as an autocrine growth factor for
Ewing’s sarcoma, a cancer thought to originate from mesenchymal
stem cells (29). The notion that growth-promoting mesenchymal
stem cells are recruited into tumors by PDGF-CC warrants further
examination.
CAF effector functions aid in tumor growth and progression. Stromal fibroblasts are rich sources for growth factors,
survival factors, and proangiogenic factors during wound healing
(30), as well as in tumorigenesis (4, 6, 31, 32). Nevertheless, the
molecular identity of factors of direct functional importance for
the tumor growth–promoting effects or for the maintenance
of the CAF phenotype is still not understood in detail. A survey of
angiogenic inducers in a xenograft study showed that all factors,
apart from VEGF-A, were produced in higher quantities by stromal
cells as compared with the overt tumor cells (33). Moreover, a
recent study using laser capture microdissection of normal and
prostate cancer–derived stroma identified an autocrine loop within
CAFs involving the chemokine CXCL14. Here, CXCL14 was found to
be an effector of the stimulatory support provided to the tumor in
terms of regulation of angiogenesis.4 Another chemokine, fibroblast-derived CXCL12/SDF-1, serves to recruit endothelial progenitor cells into the neovasculature of tumors, thereby promoting
angiogenesis and tumor growth (34). Finally, using mice expressing
GFP under the VEGF promoter, Fukumura and colleagues showed
a dramatic induction of VEGF promoter activity in stromal cells in
spontaneous mammary tumors or on implantation of solid tumors
(35). Indeed, consistent with this, an inability of tumor cells to
produce VEGF-A mandates recruitment of VEGF-secreting stromal
fibroblasts in a PDGFR-a–dependent manner (15).
We have recently identified FGF-2 derived from stromal
fibroblasts as a crucial mediator of the angiogenic response in
cervical squamous cell carcinoma (23). The production of FGF-2
was attenuated by administration of PDGFR inhibitors, yielding
therapeutic efficacy in a stringent genetically engineered mouse
model of cervical cancer (23). Consistent with our earlier study, we
here found that FGF-2 is present in higher abundance in tumors
expressing PDGFC. In addition, we found that stromal fibroblasts
within B16/PDGF-C tumors produce high levels of osteopontin.
Intriguingly, FGF-2 and osteopontin are known to act in concert
to promote tumor angiogenesis (36). Osteopontin is a soluble
extracellular matrix protein harboring an RGD site with a known
function in suppression of apoptosis, promotion of angiogenesis,
and induction of metastasis (37). Whereas many cell-surface

phase I studies of the combination of imatinib with chemotherapeutic drugs have been terminated due to disproportionate
toxicity (48, 49). Hence, efforts to effectively target the tumor
stroma should be helped by the development of more specific
inhibitors, such as neutralizing PDGF-CC antibodies. In conclusion,
mounting evidence points to paracrine PDGF signaling as being
crucial for the recruitment and phenotypic conversion of CAFs, and
provides further rationale for clinical testing of the concept of
therapeutic targeting of stromal fibroblasts in cancer.

melanoma had received treatment with imatinib, no objective
clinical efficacy was observed (47). There may be several reasons
for this, including the low number of patients included in the trial
and the unknown expression status of PDGFC, its activating
enzyme tissue plasminogen activator (20), and stromal PDGFR-a
by these tumors. Moreover, experience from the past years of
clinical trials using small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors points
out that clinical efficacy is more likely if the target is genetically
altered by mutation. In contrast, inhibition by neutralizing
antibodies has displayed demonstrable efficacy on stromal targets,
as in the case of inhibition of VEGF-A signaling by bevacizumab.
Stromally expressed PDGFR-a would likely appear in a nonmutated form, making inhibition of PDGF ligands by neutralizing
antibodies a more attractive therapeutic alternative from an
empirical point of view.
Nevertheless, it is likely that therapeutic modalities targeting the
tumor stroma will prove to be most efficacious in combination
with simultaneous targeting of other tumor compartments.
Rational drug combinations would conceivably weaken the stromal
proangiogenic, progrowth, and antiapoptotic support, thereby
sensitizing the tumor to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or
antiangiogenic treatments. It is imperative that the substances
used for inhibition are specific for their targets to avoid excessive
side effects from combining several drugs. In fact, several early
