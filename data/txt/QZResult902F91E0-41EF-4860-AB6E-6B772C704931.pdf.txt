ABSTRACT
DNA instability is an important contributor to cancer development. Previously,
defects in the chromosome segregation and excessive DNA double strand breaks due
to the replication or oxidative stresses were implicated in DNA instability in cancer.
Here, we demonstrate that DNA instability can directly result from the oncogeneinduced senescence signaling. Expression of the activated form of Her2 oncogene,
NeuT, in immortalized breast epithelial cells led to downregulation of the major DNA
repair factor histone H2AX and a number of other components of the HR and NHEJ
double strand DNA breaks repair pathways. H2AX expression was regulated at the
transcriptional level via a senescence pathway involving p21-mediated regulation
of CDK and Rb1. The p21-dependent downregulation of H2AX was seen both in cell
culture and the MMTV-neu mouse model of Her2-positive breast cancer. Importantly,
downregulation of H2AX upon Her2/NeuT expression impaired repair of double
strand DNA breaks. This impairment resulted in both increased DNA instability in
the form of somatic copy number alterations, and in increased sensitivity to the
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Overall, these findings indicate that the Her2/
NeuT oncogene signaling directly potentiates DNA instability and increases sensitivity
to DNA damaging treatments.

INTRODUCTION

to be represented within the primary carcinoma, indicating
that the genetic heterogeneity of metastases can exist
before disseminating from the primary carcinoma [3].
Similarly, the degree of loss of heterozygosity (multiple
deletions) in Her2-positive cancers [4] paralleled a
substantial SCNA in early lesions, e.g. in breast lobular
carcinoma in situ [5]. Interestingly, further progression
towards cancer was not associated with higher instability.
Indeed, amplifications and deletions in ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS) were similar to those in neighboring tumors
[6]. SCNAs in DCIS and invasive carcinoma also exhibit
close similarity [7]. Therefore, most DNA instability in
Her2-positive breast cancer arises in early lesions. The
mechanisms of this instability may result from either
oncogene activation or tumor suppressor inactivation.
For example, expression of H-RasV12 or inactivation of
PTEN or Rb1 induces chromosomal instability in various
cell lines [8, 9]. Recently, we linked oncogene-induced

Most cancer cells are characterized by genomic
instability manifested by aneuploidy with numerous
karyotypic changes including whole chromosome gain
and losses, translocations, deletions, amplifications,
etc. According to current paradigm in the field, DNA
instability is either the root cause of cancer or a critical
contributor to cancer development. Genetic instability, i.e.
aneuploidy, often results from abnormalities in mitosis
[1], as well as abnormalities in the double strand break
repair or telomere maintenance that can lead to repeated
chromosome breakage–fusion–bridge cycles [2].
DNA instability (somatic copy number alterations,
SCNA) is pervasive in tumors of different origin. Overall,
it seems that genomic instability occurs early during
tumorgenesis. For example, clonal populations within
distant metastases from a pancreatic cancer were shown

senescence (OIS) pathway with downregulation of the
major DNA repair factor histone H2AX, and suggested
that this pathway may be directly responsible for DNA
instability in early lesions [10]. OIS represents an early
barrier to neoplastic transformation [11-20], and therefore
in order to become cancerous, cells acquire mutations
or epigenetic changes that allow them to “turn off” the
senescence program.
We have recently demonstrated that the
morphological and biochemical signs of senescence are
not rigidly linked to permanent growth arrest. In fact, while
activation of the oncogenes in epithelial cells with normal
finite lifespan causes genuine senescence, activation
of Her2/NeuT or Ras oncogenes in immortalized cells
expressing endogenous telomerase triggers morphological
and biochemical manifestations of senescence (e.g. SAβ-gal), but does not ensure full growth arrest [10]. We
called this condition Senescence With Incomplete Growth
arrest (SWING). Importantly, SWING cells, despite their
senescent appearance, are transformed and support tumor
growth in xenographts [10]. Interestingly, in several types
of mouse and human cancer proliferating cells in tumors
simultaneously showed positive staining for SA-β-gal [19,
21, 22]. Based on these data, we suggested that SWING
could be an intermediate step in carcinogenesis in vivo.
One of the major properties of cells in the SWING
state induced by expression of the Her2 oncogene was
downregulation of histone H2AX [10]. This findings lay
the basis for a hypothesis that expression of an active

Her2 oncogene results in suppression of the DNA repair
systems, which drives genetic instability, and here, we test
this hypothesis.

RESULTS
Her2/NeuT oncogene causes downregulation of
H2AX in a p21-dependent manner
Previously we demonstrated that expression of
NeuT in immortalized breast cancer epithelial cells
MCF10A leads to significant downregulation of the
major DNA repair factor histone H2AX. This effect
required the upregulation of the senescence mediator
p21 (1). Here we investigated if this pathway functions
in vivo in the MMTV-neu mouse model of Her2-positive
breast cancer. The age of tumor emergence in this
strain of mice is approximately 12 month. Accordingly,
12-month-old NeuT-expressing (MMTV-neu) mice and
control FVB/NJ female mice were sacrificed, and levels
of p21 and H2AX were assessed in isolated mammary
tissue by immunohistochemistry with corresponding
antibodies. Similar to cell culture experiments and in
vivo observations in young (3 months old) mice (1),
expression of NeuT caused significant up-regulation of
p21 and simultaneously down-regulation of H2AX (Fig.
1A, B). To address if Her2-mediated suppression of H2AX

NeuT+/- mice. Mammary glands of 12 months old NeuT+/-p21+/+ and NeuT+/-p21-/- mice were immunostained for H2AX.

is p21-dependent in vivo we crossed NeuT-expressing
(MMTV-neu) mice with p21 knockout mice to obtain a
NeuT+/-p21-/- female litter. NeuT+/-p21+/+ females were used
as a control (see Material and Methods). As seen on Fig.
1C, both strains demonstrated strong expression of NeuT.
Importantly, knockout of p21 reversed the downregulation
of H2AX in NeuT-expressing mice (Fig. 1D). Therefore,
the Her2-p21-H2AX pathway we previously identified in
a breast cancer cell line is also functional in vivo in mouse
mammary tissue.
While the mechanism of upregulation of p21
by Her2 in breast epithelial cells has been dissected
previously, and involves the inflammatory loop and
transcription factor Stat3 [23], the mechanism of H2AX
downregulation by p21 remains unexplored. Therefore
we next tested whether the changes in H2AX levels are
caused by changes in protein degradation, translational
efficiency, mRNA decay, or transcription. First, immortal
human breast epithelial MCF10A cells were infected with
control or Her2-expressing retrovirus, as in our prior
publications (1), and Her2 expression was confirmed by

immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). At day 5 post infection, after
brief puromycin selection, the rate of degradation of
H2AX in parental and MCF10A/Her2 cells was measured
by immunoblotting following inhibition of translation by
emetine. No significant degradation of H2AX either in
control or NeuT-expressing cells was observed within six
hours (Fig. 2B), indicating that the protein is relatively
stable, thus eliminating the possibility that downregulation
occurs via faster protein degradation. Next, to check if
suppression of H2AX is due to less efficient translation,
we used a 3’UTR Renilla/Luciferase double reporter
(see Materials and Methods). In this reporter system
Renilla is expressed under the control of 3’UTR of H2AX
mRNA, while liciferase is extressed from the same
plasmid without this 3’UTR, and serves as a standard
for normalization. We observed minor translational
suppression when H2AX 3’UTR was attached to the
Renila gene; however, there was no difference in levels
of the reporter luciferase/3’UTR between MCF10A and
MCF10A/NeuT cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, translation
cannot explain downregulation of H2AX expression by

Fig.2: NeuT oncogene suppresses expression of

cells were infected with NeuT- expressing virus and two days
post-infection selected with puromicin (0.75µg/ml). Control
cells were infected with a corresponding empty virus. After
6 days of selection, cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed
by immunoblotting. B. NeuT expression does not affect

MCF10A cells were infected as above. On day 6, post-infection
cells were transfected with plasmid expressing renilla luciferase
under H2AX 3’UTR control and the firefly luciferase used as an
internal control. Translational efficiency was measured as renilla/
luciferase ration (relative units). D. NeuT oncogene suppresses
transcription of H2AX mRNA. MCF10A cells were infected as
above, and Q-PCR was performed as described in Materials and
Methods to measure H2AX mRNA. Each sample was analyzed
in triplicates. E. NeuT expression does not affect stability of
H2AX mRNA. MCF10A cells were infected as above. Cells
were treated with actinomycin D (7µg/ml) and samples for RNA
extraction were collected at corresponding time points. Q-PCR
was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Each
point represents three independent experiments. F. Inhibition
of CDKs suppresses expression of H2AX. MCF10A cells were
treated with indicated doses of roscovitine overnight. Cells
were lysed and H2AX levels were assayed by immunoblotting.
G. Rb silencing reverses suppression of H2AX levels caused
by expression of NeuT. MCF10A cells were simultaneously
infected with NeuT- expressing retrovirus (under blasticidin
selection) and siRB1-expressing lentivirus (under puromycin
selection); control cells were infected with corresponding empty
viruses. Two days post-infection puromycin (0.75µg/ml) and
blastocidin (10µg/ml) were added and after another 7 days cells
were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by immunoblotting to assay
H2AX levels (left panel) or by Q-PCR to assay level of Rb1
silencing (right panel).

comparable with pBABE-based expression levels of
Her2 and then verified that both viruses lead to similar
(~70%) suppression of H2AX expression (data not
shown). Next, MCF10A cells were simultaneously
infected with lentivirus expressing shRb1 and retrovirus
expressing NeuT. Corresponding ‘empty’ viruses were
used as controls. As seen on Fig. 2G, 80% suppression of
Rb1 almost completely reversed the effects of NeuT on
H2AX downregulation, thus indicating that Rb1 is both
necessary and sufficient for H2AX regulation. Therefore,
transcriptional regulation of the DNA repair factor H2AX
upon expression of the Her2/NeuT oncogene appears to
involve the classical p21-CDK-Rb pathway.
We further investigated whether NeuT expression
affects other components of the double strand DNA repair
pathways, including the Homologous Recombination
repair (HR) pathway and the Non-Homologous End
Joining (NHEJ) pathway. Accordingly, we chose several
major components of these pathways and tested their
levels upon expression of NeuT by Q-PCR. Indeed, levels
of components of the HR pathway, RPA1 and BRCA1,
were significantly reduced in NeuT-expressing cells, while
levels of BRCA2 and Rad51 remained almost unchanged.
Similarly, levels of Ku70 and XRCC4 components of
the NHEJ pathway declined upon NeuT transformation,
while levels of Artemis, DNA PKCcs, and Ligase 4 did
not change (Table 1). In addition, the levels of upstream
sensor of double DNA breaks, MRE11a was also strongly
suppressed. Therefore, it appears that expression of the
Her2/NeuT oncogenes reduces expression of components
of multiple DNA repair pathways. This may significantly
jeopardize DNA repair and enhance DNA instability.

Her2. Next, we compared the levels of H2AX mRNA
in parental and MCF10A/NeuT cells by RT-PCR. As
seen in Fig. 2D, NeuT expression causes H2AX mRNA
levels to reduce by about 50%. To understand whether
the effect was due to lower transcription or higher mRNA
degradation, we blocked transcription with actinomycin
D and monitored levels of H2AX mRNA at different time
points (Fig. 2E). In both MCF10A and MCF10A/NeuT
cells, the rates of H2AX mRNA degradation were similar,
indicating that Her2 does not affect the RNA degradation.
Therefore regulation of H2AX expression by NeuT occurs
at the transcription level.
The main mechanism by which p21 may inhibit
the transcription of a specific gene involves inhibition
of Rb phosphorylation by CDK4, 6. This subsequently
inactivates the E2F family transcription factors [24].
To test whether this pathway is involved in H2AX
regulation, we inhibited CDK proteins to see if this
would mimic the effects of p21 on H2AX expression.
Accordingly, MCF10A cells were treated with a broadspecificity CDK inhibitor, roscovitine, and then levels
of H2AX were monitored 15h later by immunoblotting.
As seen in Fig. 2F, roscovitine treatment led to a dosedependent suppression of H2AX expression. We further
tested if knockdown of Rb1 reverses the effects of Her2
on H2AX downregulation. Using a lentivirus expressing
Rb1-interfering shRNA that could be selected for using
puromycin, we subcloned NeuT into a pCXbs retrovirus
that was selected for using blastocidin. We titrated this
virus to achieve levels of NeuT expression that were

Her2/NeuT oncogene suppresses DNA repair
Upon exposure to genotoxic agents that cause
double stranded DNA breaks, such as γ-irradiation, H2AX
undergoes phosphorylation at Ser139. Phosphorylated
H2AX (γH2AX) then recruits critical components of
the DNA repair machinery leading to formation of
‘irradiation foci’ at the sites of DNA damage. Accordingly,
downregulation of H2AX and other components of the
DNA repair pathways upon expression of Her2 may lead
to defects in DNA repair. To test this possibility, NeuTtransformed MCF10A cells were subjected to 5Gy gammairradiation while the formation of foci by γH2AX and the
quantities of two other important DNA repair factors, RPA
and p53BP1 were monitored by immunoflourescence. The
resolution of foci, reflecting completed DNA repair, was
also monitored at different time points after irradiation.
For all three repair factors, γH2AX, RPA and p53BP1, we
observed significantly reduced foci formation at the initial
2-hour time point (Fig. 3A, B). Interestingly, with γH2AX
and RPA factors, we also observed slower foci resolution,
which suggests suppressed DNA repair (Fig. 3C).
To investigate the effects of Her2 on the double

strand DNA break repair by an independent method,
we utilized a DR-GFP reporter system [25]. In this
system, a GFP gene rendered un-functional by insertion
of a recognition site for the I-SceI endonuclease can
be repaired through homologous recombination using
another non-functional GFP gene expressed from the same
plasmid. As seen on Figs. 3D, E, expression of NeuT led

to almost 75% reduction in the number of GFP positive
cells, indicating that NeuT suppresses the HR DNA repair
process. To test whether H2AX insufficiency is the sole
cause of the reduced DNA repair capacity, we expressed
H2AX in these cells using a lentiviral expression system
(Fig. 3F). As seen in Fig. 3E, expression of H2AX
significantly alleviated Her2-mediated suppression of

HR. Therefore, H2AX appears to be the limiting factor
in the DNA repair defects caused by Her2 expression.
Overall, these independent experiments indicate that Her2
expression leads to defects in the double strand breaks
DNA repair, and that the defect is associated with H2AX
downregulation.

(Fig. 4B). We then identified a few SCNAs present in
parental MCF10A cells that were probably acquired
during immortalization (Fig. 4C). These parental SCNAs
were removed from our analysis of DNA instability. We
then used the total volume of all SCNAs, i.e. the sum
of each SCNA’s copy-number change multiplied by
its length, as an aggregate measure of DNA instability
(SI). First, we note that NeuT-transformed cells did not
show a significantly higher load of SCNAs than parental
populations (Fig. 4C) eliminating the possibility that the
Her2/NeuT oncogene transformation by itself causes
significant spontaneous DNA instability.
Next, we tested whether Her2-transformed cells
exhibit increased level of induced DNA instability by
exposing both a parental MCF10A clone and one of the
MCF10A/NeuT clones to low-dose (sub-therapeutic)
doxorubicin, thereby introducing DNA damage. To
accomplish this, cells were treated overnight with 10
and 20nM of doxorubicin, then grown in normal media
for 4 days and then cloned. DNA from these clones was
isolated and hybridized on SNP-arrays. As seen on Fig.
4C, treatment with either 10nM or 20nM of doxorubicin
did not cause significant DNA instability in parental
cells; however, even low 10nM doses of doxorubicin
triggered significant DNA instability in Her2-expressing
cells, while 20nM caused even stronger effects (Fig. 4C).
Therefore, overall expression of the Her2 oncogene in
breast epithelial cells reduces the expression of major
DNA repair factors, which leads to reduced DNA repair
capacity and enhanced DNA instability.

Her2/NeuT oncogene increases DNA instability
Cell’s reduced ability to repair double strand DNA
breaks upon transformation with the Her2 oncogene may
lead to DNA instability. To test this possibility directly,
we characterized the level of spontaneous and induced
DNA instability in Her2/NeuT-transfromed cells as
compared to a parental control cells. Population of cells
that persist in culture over long time periods may acquire
DNA rearrangements and, thus, become genetically
heterogeneous. To accurately assess the extent of DNA
instability using SNP-arrays, we needed genetically
homogenous populations, which were attained by growing
clones of the MCF10A cells (Fig. 4A). Randomly selected
clones were expanded, infected with retrovirus expressing
NeuT (as in our prior experiments), and cloned again to
yield three independent Her2/NeuT-transformed clones.
We then used standard procedures to detect genomic
amplifications and deletions (SCNA) by hybridization
isolated genomic DNA to human SNP-arrays (See
Methods and Materials). To characterize DNA instability,
we normalized and segmented SNP-array data to detect
individual alterations, their length and copy-number

SMNA in MCF10A cells according to the SNP analysis. Deletions and amplifications along the chromosomes 2, 11, 14 and 22 are shown
as example. (C) Quantification of SNMA in control and NeuT-expressing cells treated with indicated doses of doxorubicin. (D) Sensitivity

In line with these results, we found that Her2transformed MCF10A cells were significantly more
sensitive (determined by colony survival) to doxorubicin
treatment than the parental untransformed MCF10A cells
(Fig. 4D). Therefore, the overall expression of Her2/NeuT
oncogene in breast epithelial cells reduces the expression
of major DNA repair factors, and leads to a reduced ability
to repair DNA and enhanced DNA instability, which in
turn affect cells’ sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatments.

expression of Her2 causes significant downregulation
of multiple DNA repair factors besides H2AX. These
factors are involved in both HR and NHEJ DNA repair
pathways, and include RPA1, BRCA1, Ku70, XRCC4 and
MRE11a. Therefore, it is possible that both pathways of
double strand DNA break repair are jeopardized in Her2expressing cells. Consistent with these findings, these
cells had significantly increased vulnerability to genotoxic
stress, as judged by a colony-forming assay. Suppression
of DNA repair significantly increased DNA instability
upon treatments with very low doses of doxorubicin.
Indeed, incubation with 10 or 20nM doxirubicin created
almost no SCNAs in control cells, yet many SCNAs in
Her2-expressing cells.
In our prior study, we linked downregulation of
H2AX upon expression of Her2 to activation of senescence
signaling (i.e. induction of p21) and progression to
a SWING state [10]. This dependence was shown in
cultured cells. Here, we demonstrated that this pathway
functions in vivo in a mouse model of Her2-positive
cancer. Indeed, expression of Her2 in the mammary tissue
led to induction of p21 and downregulation of H2AX.
Furthermore, downregulation of H2AX was effectively
reversed by the p21 knockout.
Further question addressed in this study is how
Her2 affects expression of H2AX. While the pathway that
links Her2 and p21 has been established and involves the
transcription factor Stat3, the downstream section of the
pathway, i.e. how p21 regulates expression of H2AX, has
not been known. Here, we demonstrated that the major
p21-controlled Rb pathway is involved in this regulation.
Indeed, depletion of Rb reversed the effects of Her2
expression on H2AX levels. Furthermore, overexpression
of Rb mimicked the effects of p21 expression on the
levels of H2AX. Inhibition of CDKs had a similar effect,
indicating that this regulation involves the p21-CDK-Rb
pathway. Based on these findings, it is likely that this
regulation also involves one or more of the eight E2F
transcription factors.
Overall, this work describes a new mechanism of
DNA instability in cancer. It demonstrates that senescence
signaling, activated by Her2, leads to suppression of DNA
repair pathways, increases DNA instability and increases
vulnerability to genotoxic stresses.

DISCUSSION
DNA instability is found in almost all human
cancers. In some cancers, e.g. triple-negative breast
cancer, DNA instability is an integral part of the process
of tumorigenesis, and is driven by defects in DNA repair
systems (e.g. mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2), which
result in further cancer-driving mutations. In other
cancers, DNA instability results from defects in mitosis,
which leads to large chromosomal rearrangements and
aneuploidy. Yet, for the majority of cancers the origin of
DNA instability is unclear. The major question in the field
is whether DNA instability is the cause or the consequence
of cancer.
Here, we investigated the origin of DNA instability
in the model of Her2-positive cancer, where no obvious
link to defects in DNA repair systems has been reported.
We built upon our prior data that expression of Her2/
NeuT oncogene in the breast epithelial cells MCF10A
caused downregulation of the major DNA repair factor
histone H2AX [10]. We then hypothesized that DNA
instability in Her2-positive cancers results directly from
the Her2 oncogene’s activity. Since Her2 is expressed
in early lesions (i.e. ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)),
our hypothesis predicts that these lesions should exhibit
DNA instability. Indeed, in human cancer studies, DNA
instability was reported in early lesions, as early as DCIS
[26-28]. Moreover, our hypothesis predicts that instability
results from defects in DNA repair (specifically p21
mediated H2AX downregulation), and not from mitotic
defects. In this study of DCIS lesions, DNA instability
was monitored using the microsatellite instability assay.
This assay should only detect focal SCNAs, and not
than large chromosomal rearrangements [6]. Hence, it
suggests that DNA instability in these lesions is indeed a
result of improper DNA repair. Most convincingly, DNA
instability in DCIS correlated with increased expression
of Her2, upregulation of p21 and pleomorphic nuclei
[29-31]. All these findings are highly consistent with
our hypothesis that activation of Her2 upregulates p21,
which downregulates histone H2AX, which induces DNA
instability.
The data reported here provided direct experimental
prove that expression of the Her2 oncogene alone in
immortalized breast epithelial cells is sufficient to cause
defects in the HR DNA repair pathway. Interestingly,

Recombinant retro- and lentiviral vectors
H2AX-expressing lentivirus and control ‘empty’
lentivirus were a kind gift from Dr. E. Brown (University
of Pennsylvania Medical School, Philadelphia, PA); NeuT
and control (pBABE) retroviral vectors were a kind gift
from Dr. C. Spangenberg (Trost et al., 2005). This version
of NeuT carries the activating V664E mutation (NeuT).
Retrovirus expressing NeuT under blastocidine selection
was obtained by subcloning NeuT from pBABE vector
into pCXbsr retroviral vector. Cloning was done by
Nahum Meller Custom DNA Constructs, 2340 Canterbury
Rd, University Heights, OH, 44118. pCXbs was used as
an ‘empty’ vector control. Lentivirus interfering with Rb1
was a kind gift from Professor Jim Xia (Boston University,
Boston, MA).
Retro- and lentiviruses were produced as reported
before [32, 33]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing retroviral proteins
Gag-Pol, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein
pseudotype and enhanced green fluorescent protein or
our constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). At 48 h after transfection,
supernatants containing the retroviral particles were
collected, aliquoted, and frozen at 800 C until use. Cells
were infected with diluted supernatant in the presence
of 10 µg/mL Polybrene overnight, and were selected
with puromycin (0.75 µg/mL) or blasticidin (10µg/
mL) 48 h after infection. Retroviral vectors expressing
enhanced green fluorescent protein was used as infection
efficiency indicator: virus dilution was used to achieve
approximately 90% of infected cells being GFP positive

Immunofluorescence
After treatments, cells were fixed in 100% icecold methanol/ acetone (50:50) at -200C for 10 min, then
permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 ⁄ PBS for 15 min at
room temperature (RT), then blocked in 3% BSA ⁄ PBS for
1 h, and then incubated with corresponding primary Ab
at 4oC (γH2AX[Ser139](1:400); Cat. #05-636, Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA; 53BP1(1:50); BD Biosciences,
RPA1(1:50); Calbiochem, Cat. #NA-18). Cells were
washed out 3 times for 5 minutes each with 3% BSA ⁄
PBS followed by incubation with secondary Ab for 1 hour
at RT. All antibody dilutions were made in Amplifying
Antibody Dilution Buffer (ProHisto, Cat. #AA3;
Columbia, SC). For RPA1 foci, cells were pre-extracted
for 20 seconds with 0.2% Triton X-100 ⁄ PBS prior to
fixation. Images were analyzed using Zeus fluorescent
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Mouse breeding
All animals were ordered from Jackson laboratories.
FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu)202Mul/J [Neu+/+;p21+/+] (F) was
crossed with B6129SF2/J B6;129S2-Cdkn1a<tm1Tyj>/J
p21-/- (M); P1 females(Neu+/-; p21+/-) were back-crossed

with B6129SF2/J B6;129S2-Cdkn1a<tm1Tyj>/J p21-/(M) and P2 females from the corresponding litter were
genotyped (see below) to identify [Neu+/-; p21-/-] animals.
Next, P2 (F) [Neu+/-; p21-/-] were back-crossed with
B6129SF2/J B6;129S2-Cdkn1a<tm1Tyj>/J p21-/- (M);
then the female litter was genotyped and [Neu+/-; p21-/-]
animals were used in further experiments. In parallel a
FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu)202Mul/J [NeuT+/+;p21+/+] (F)
was crossed with a p21WT parent M B6129SF2/J (M).
The female litter [Neu+/-; p21+/+] was used as a control.
FVB/NJ females were used as a control for FVB/NTg(MMTVneu)202Mul/J mice.
Animal maintenance and experiments were
conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Genotyping
For genotyping, genomic DNA was purified from
tails using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Cat.
#69504; Valencia, CA). PCR to define p21 and NeuT
status was performed according Jackson Laboratories
recommendations.

Clonogenic assay
Cells after treatments were counted using Scepter
(Cat. #PHCC00000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and
plated in triplicates on 100-mm Petri dishes. After 10
days, the colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet
in 70% ethanol and quantified. Survival was calculated
as a percentage of colonies formed relative to untreated
controls.

Real Time PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cells using Qiagen
RNeasy Mini kit (Cat. #74104; Valencia, CA;). The
RETROscript Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA; Cat.
#AM1710) was used to convert 2mg RNA into cDNA.
qRT–PCR was performed using the SensiFast SYBR
Green PCR kit (Bioline, Cat. # Bio-92020; London,UK;)
according to the manufacture’s protocols; expression
levels of GADPH were used as an internal control. Realtime analysis was implemented with a Applied Biosystems
S7300 instrument using the following primers:

3’UTR translation assay
MCF10A cells were infected with “empty” or NeuT
expressing retrovirus and selected with puromycin. On day
6 post-infection, cells were transfected using GeneCellin
(BioCellChalange) with psiCHECK2 (Promega) vector
(1µg per well in 6-well plate) containing the 3’ UTR
of H2AX cloned in the multiple cloning site of Renilla
(kind gift from Dr. Chowdhury, Harvard Medical School.)
After 24 h we measured renilla and luciferase activities
using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and
the TopCount NXT microplate reader (Perkin Elmer), as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were normalized
to Firefly luciferase. Each measurement was done in
triplicates.

Measurement of HR activity with DR-GFP assay
HR activity was evaluated using the DR-GFP
recombination substrate with a recognition site for the
I-SceI endonuclease in one copy of the GFP gene. A
gene conversion event within this substrate results in
the expression of intact GFP protein [34]. Exponentially
growing MCF10A/DR-GFP cells infected with
corresponding viruses were transfected with a plasmid

growth for an additional 24 h in fresh media, cells were
harvested by trypsinization and re-suspended in PBS.
Cells were analyzed for GFP expression by flowcytometry.

interest and the ancestral genome, then it was excluded
from our assessment of DNA instability. DNA instability
was assessed by counting the total number of SCNA in a
sample and by measuring their aggregate volume. Each
SCNA individual volume was defined as its length (end
location minus start location) multiplied by its amplitude
(absolute difference from diploid).

FACS analysis
FACS analysis was performed on BD Biosciences
(San Jose, CA, USA) FACSCalibur, and data were
analyzed with BD FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.;10.0.7 software.)

Assessment of Somatic Copy Number Alterations
(SCNA)

REFERENCES

DNA was isolated from individual clones and
genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP
Array 6.0 (Cat. #901150) courtesy of the Broad Institute’s
Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program.
SNP probe intensities were quantified and DNA
copy number was determined by segmenting SNP
probes along the genome into tracks of equal copy
number using the GLAD software package, an adaptive
weights smoothing algorithm [35]. SCNAs were then
identified from these tracks using a simplified calling
rubric. Histograms of background-subtracted Log2 mean
segment intensity were generated and then smoothed using
a Gaussian kernel. Each sample’s histogram exhibited
3-4 well-defined peaks, separated by approximately
integer distances. Mean track intensities were scaled by a
multiplicative constant such that the second peak, always
the sample mode, was scaled to a ploidy value of 2.0
(diploid). All track were then assigned ploidy by rounding
their intensity to the nearest integer, baring one exception.
If a track (1) contained only 1-2 probes, (2) was flanked
on the left and right by tracks with the same ploidy, and
(3) was within 1.0 intensity of its flanking assignment,
the track was merged with its flanking assignments (e.g.
a very short track with a scaled signal intensity of 3.72,
and neighboring tracks assigned a ploidy of 3, would
be merged with its neighboring tracks to forge one long
SCNA of ploidy 3, rather than rounded to a ploidy of
4. SCNA were then defined as uninterrupted tracks of
ploidy other than diploid. We chose this method, rather an
existing software package, because (i) our samples were
clonal and did not need stromal rectifications, and (ii) we
wanted an approach that did not bias towards specificity
or sensitivity in calling SCNA, as we wanted to use these
calls only to assess overall DNA instability.
Ancestral SCNA (existing in the cell lines prior
to experimentation) were removed by identifying an
ancestral genome. This ancestral genome was defined
by SCNA that were shared (equal ploidy and ≥75%
overlap) among all un-mutagenized (0 nM Dox) among
all un-transformed (pBABE) MCF-10A clones. If a
SCNA was shared (defined above) between a sample of
