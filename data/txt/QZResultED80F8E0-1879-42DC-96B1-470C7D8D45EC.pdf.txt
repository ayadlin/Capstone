ABSTRACT
Cancer metastasis is a complex process, and the incidence of metastasis
is influenced by many biological factors. Orosomucoid 2 (ORM2) is an important
glycoprotein that is mainly biosynthesized and secreted by hepatocytes. As an
acute-phase protein, ORM2 likely plays important roles in anti-inflammation,
immunomodulation and drug delivery. However, little is known regarding the function
of ORM2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we determined that ORM2
expression in HCC tissues was negatively associated with intrahepatic metastasis and
histological grade. Moreover, the ectopic overexpression of ORM2 decreased HCC cell
migration and invasion in vitro and intrahepatic metastasis in vivo, whereas silencing
ORM2 expression resulted in increased tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. The
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) upregulated ORM2 expression, while
only the LAP1/2 (C/EBPβ isoforms) possessed transcription-promoting activity on the
ORM2 promoter. Subsequently, we found that LAP1 repressed HCC cell migration and
invasion via the induction of ORM2 expression. Consistently, the protein expression
of C/EBPβ was negatively associated with histological grade and positively correlated
with ORM2 protein expression in HCC tissues. Collectively, our findings indicate
that ORM2 is a functional downstream target of C/EBPβ and functions as a tumor
suppressor in HCC.

INTRODUCTION

underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved in
HCC metastasis [2].
Orosomucoid (ORM), also known as alpha 1 acid
glycoprotein, is an important glycoprotein with a molecular
weight of 41-43 kDa. The ORM family includes two
main members: ORM1 and ORM2 [3]. ORM2 is a type
of acute-phase protein and is mainly biosynthesized and
secreted by hepatocytes. ORM2 is generally considered
an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factor due
to its anti-neutrophil and anti-complement activity [4].

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most common malignant cancers worldwide. Most
patients with HCC have a poor prognosis, largely due
to a high rate of postsurgical recurrence and metastasis
[1]. Cancer metastasis is a complex process, and the
incidence of metastasis is influenced by many biological
and environmental factors. Hence, there is an urgent
need to identify metastatic factors and elucidate the

RESULTS

ORM2 also depresses cytokine secretion by an unknown
mechanism to protect human health [5]. Additionally,
ORM serves as a bimodal regulator of angiogenesis and
enhances capillary permeability in guinea pig skin [6, 7].
Other studies have indicated that ORM inhibits endothelial
cell capillary-like tube formation in a manner that may be
explained by diminished cell adhesion to the underlying
matrix and/or reversible decreases in cell migration [8],
and ORM can decrease microvascular permeability as
well as tumor cell adhesion [9]. This emerging evidence
suggests that ORM2 may play important roles in tumor
metastasis and progression. ORM2 expression positively
correlates with the progression of colorectal cancer [10,
11] and lung cancer [12, 13]. Moreover, ORM2 is believed
to be a potential biomarker for cholangiocarcinoma
in combination with kinesin 18A [14]. However, the
function of ORM2 in HCC and the relationship between
its expression and clinicopathologic significance remain
unclear.
Many external stimuli can upregulate ORM2
expression, including IL-6 and glucocorticoids [6].
Moreover, a binding motif for the CCAAT/enhancer
binding protein β (C/EBPβ) has been identified in the
promoter region of human ORM2 [15]. C/EBPβ is an
important regulator that has been implicated in many
biological activities, including inflammatory responses,
adiposeness and cancer progression. C/EBPβ exists as
three isoforms (LAP1, LAP2 and LIP) that are translated
by in-frame alternative translation initiation [16]. LAP1
and LAP2 are transcriptional activators, while LIP
functions as a repressor through its antagonism for LAP
[17]. LIP has been reported to be deregulated in breast
cancer and to promote breast cancer invasion [18]. The loss
of C/EBPβ regulation in breast cancer promotes malignant
progression by shifting the TGF-β response from growth
inhibition to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT),
invasion and metastasis [19]. Additionally, C/EBPβ
expression is upregulated by Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) in oral carcinomas and esophageal
squamous cell carcinomas [20, 21] due to endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress in hepatoma cells [22]. However,
the role of C/EBPβ in HCC tumorigenesis and how the
three isoforms of C/EBPβ regulate ORM2 in HCC remain
poorly understood.
In the present study, we found that ORM2 was
significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and inhibited
HCC cell metastasis. Additionally, we found that the
LAP1/2 isoforms of C/EBPβ could upregulate ORM2
expression by directly binding to the ORM2 promoter,
thereby repressing HCC cell migration and invasion
through the induction of ORM2 expression.

ORM2 is frequently downregulated in HCC
tissues and is negatively associated with tumor
progression and intrahepatic metastasis
To investigate the clinicopathological role
of ORM2 in HCC progression, we determined the
expression levels of the ORM2 protein in 236 pairs of
HCC tissues and matched non-tumorous liver tissues
using immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). Out
of the 236 cases, 177 cases (75%) had lower ORM2
protein expression in HCC tissues compared with their
corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues, 49 (20.76%)
cases had similar expression, and only 10 (4.24%) HCC
patients had higher expression in cancer tissues (Figure
1A and 1B). Therefore, the results showed that ORM2
was frequently downregulated in primary HCC tissues
compared with the adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues.
qRT-PCR and Western blot assays further verified that
ORM2 expression was downregulated in HCC tissues
(Figure 1C and 1D).
Based on the IHC results, the expression intensity
of the ORM2 protein was scored as 0 or 1 for weak or
strong immunostaining, respectively. The analysis showed
that ORM2 expression was negatively associated with the
histological grade of HCC (p = 0.013) and the presence
of intrahepatic metastasis (p = 0.024). However, there
was no correlation between ORM2 expression and other
clinicopathological factors, such as age, gender, tumor
size, the presence of cirrhosis, serum alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels
(Table 1). Taken together, our results suggest that the loss
of ORM2 expression might contribute to HCC progression
and metastasis.

ORM2 significantly inhibits HCC cell migration
and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo
Next, we measured ORM2 mRNA expression
in HCC cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1). ORM2
expression was upregulated only in Huh7 and PLC/
PRF/5 cells, whereas in other cells, ORM2 expression
was barely detectable. These results were consistent with
the pattern of ORM2 protein expression in HCC tissues,
where ORM2 protein expression was barely detectable by
Western blot or IHC.
To better understand the function of ORM2 in HCC,
we constructed a lentivirus vector containing the complete
ORF of ORM2 and established the SMMC-7721-ORM2,
Li-7-ORM2 and HCC-LY5-ORM2 HCC cell lines; cells
infected with an empty vector were used as controls
(Figure 2A). We also designed three shRNAs using
lentivirus vectors to specifically knock down endogenous

two effective shRNAs (shORM2-1 and shORM2-2) for
further assays (Figure 2B). MTT and colony formation
assays indicated that ORM2 had no notable effect on HCC
cell growth in vitro (Figure 2C and 2D), while ORM2
overexpression obviously repressed orthotopic tumor
growth in vivo (Figure 2E).

As mentioned above, the clinical data showed
that ORM2 is involved in HCC intrahepatic metastasis.
Therefore, we performed in vitro transwell migration
and invasion assays to assess the effect of ORM2 on the
spreading metastatic potential of HCC cells. The results
showed that stable overexpression of ORM2 significantly

0.05, Figure 3C). Therefore, these results indicate that

markedly increased the migration and invasion of Huh7

that ORM2 significantly inhibits HCC cell migration and
invasion in vitro.

4A). Among these isoforms, LAP1 and LAP2 have the
same transcription factor binding site and are generally
considered to activate translation, while LIP is believed
to inhibit translation by antagonizing LAP [23]. To
verify the function of these isoforms in the regulation of
ORM2, lentivirus vectors containing the complete ORF
of LAP1, LAP2 or LIP were constructed, and the activity
of the ORM2 promoter was examined using luciferase
reporter assays in cells overexpressing the three isoforms.
The results showed that ORM2 promoter activity was
enhanced when LAP1 or LAP2 were stably overexpressed,
while LIP overexpression had no obvious effect on the
ORM2 promoter activity in HCC cells (Figure 4B). ORM2
promoter activity was not enhanced by co-transfection of
LAP1 or LAP2 with a mutant ORM2 promoter containing
a deletion of the C/EBPβ binding site (Figure 4B). Thus,
ORM2 expression was obviously increased when LAP1
or LAP2 was overexpressed in the SMMC-7721 and
Li-7 HCC cell lines (Figure 4C, 4D and Supplementary

LAP1/2 directly binds to the ORM2 promoter and
promotes ORM2 expression in HCC cells
To explore the regulation of ORM2 in HCC cells,
the promoter region of ORM2 was analyzed using the
TFSEARCH program. A C/EBPβ binding site located
at -48/-32bp of the ORM2 promoter region was found,
consistent with a previous report [15]. As mentioned
above, C/EBPβ has three major isoforms that possess
different functions. Therefore, we measured the expression
of the three isoforms in 30 pairs of HCC specimens by
Western blotting. The results showed that the LAP1
protein was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues
compared with matched non-cancerous liver tissues;
no changes were observed in LAP2 protein levels, and
LIP protein expression was low or undetectable (Figure

The results demonstrated that C/EBPβ expression was
lower in HCC tissues compared with non-tumorous liver
tissues, with 79.24% (187/236) C/EBPβ protein staining
in HCC tissues compared with 20.76% (49/236) of nontumorous liver tissues displaying staining to a similar
extent (Figure 5A and 5B). Therefore, the results showed
that C/EBPβ was frequently downregulated in primary
HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver
tissues. To verify the result, we performed qRT-PCR and
Western blotting to analyze C/EBPβ mRNA levels and
protein expression levels. The expression of the LAP1

adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues (Figure 5D), but no
significant difference in C/EBPβ mRNA expression was
observed (Figure 5C). Bundy et al speculated that the
production of the three isoforms from the same C/EBPβ
mRNA may be one mechanism to explain the differences
in mRNA expression and protein expression [24].
Based on the IHC results, the expression intensity
of the C/EBPβ protein was scored as 0 or 1 for weak or
strong immunostaining, respectively. The results showed
that C/EBPβ expression was negatively associated with
gender (p = 0.02) and HCC histological grade (p = 0.002).
However, there was no correlation between C/EBPβ
expression and other clinicopathological factors, such as

age, tumor size, intrahepatic metastasis (p = 0.074), the
presence of cirrhosis, and serum AFP and HBsAg levels
(Table 2).
As mentioned above, LAP1 and LAP2 play
redundant roles in the regulation of ORM2, while LIP has
no effect on ORM2. These results suggest that among the
three isoforms, LAP1/2 functions as a major regulator of
ORM2 in HCC cells. Therefore, we further investigated
the function of LAP1/2 in HCC cells. The results of in
vitro transwell migration and invasion assays showed that
LAP1 overexpression inhibited the migration and invasion
potential of SMMC-7721 and Li-7 HCC cells (Figure 5E).
Additionally, the stable overexpression of LAP2 inhibited

Therefore, our results showed that LAP1 inhibits the in

was knocked down in SMMC-7721 and Li-7 HCC cells

of LAP1 inhibited the in vitro migration and invasion
of SMMC-7721 and Li-7 HCC cells, whereas the
knockdown of ORM2 antagonized the inhibition of the in
vitro migration and invasion by LAP1 compared with the
controls (Figure 6A). The results indicate that ORM2 is a
functional downstream target of LAP1 in HCC.
Next, we analyzed the relationship between C/
EBPβ and ORM2 expression in HCC. The results showed
that there was a positive correlation between the protein
expression levels of C/EBPβ and ORM2 in HCC tissues
(r = 0.172, p = 0.008; Figure 6B and 6C). Further analysis
demonstrated that out of the 187 HCC tissues, in which
C/EBPβ expression was downregulated compared with
non-tumorous liver tissues, 75.40% (141/187) of cases

also had lower ORM2 protein expression compared with
non-tumorous liver tissues, 20.32% (38/187) of cases had
similar expression, and only 4.28% (8/187) had higher
expression in HCC tissues. Taken together, our findings
suggest that ORM2 is a functional downstream target of
LAP1 and C/EBPβ expression positively correlates with
ORM2 expression in HCC tissues.

DISCUSSION

possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
properties [11, 25-27]. ORM2 inhibits neutrophil

in the high expression of CD11b in the neutrophils of
diabetic mice [4, 28]. It is well known that inflammation
plays decisive roles at different stages of tumor
development, including initiation, promotion, malignant
conversion, invasion, and metastasis [29]. Therefore, these
experimental findings led us to hypothesize that ORM2
contributes to HCC progression.
In the present study, we demonstrated that ORM2
was frequently downregulated in primary HCC tissues
and negatively correlated with intrahepatic metastasis and

histological grade. Further studies showed that ORM2
inhibited cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in vitro
and in vivo and repressed the growth of orthotopically
implanted tumors in vivo. ORM is required for the
maintenance of normal permselectivity of the capillary
walls [30], decreased microvascular permeability and
reduced adhesion of the MDA-MB-231 mammary
tumor cells to vessel walls [9]. Tumor cell adhesion
to the microvascular wall is one of the critical steps in
tumor metastasis [31]. Our data showed that stable

MATERIALS AND METHODS

overexpression of ORM2 inhibited HCC cell growth
in vivo but not in vitro. ORM2 inhibits endothelial
cell capillary-like tube formation [8] and possesses
anti-inflammatory properties, which might help us to
understand the differences between the in vivo and in vitro
functions of the gene. The results of clinical pathological
index analysis showed that serum ORM2 levels positively
correlated with cancer progression [12] [32] [33]. Thus,
more details are needed to elucidate the mechanism of
how ORM2 affects tumor growth and metastasis in HCC
and its different functions in different tumors.
Based on previous reports [34] and our current
data, C/EBPβ is an important transcription factor for
the regulation of ORM2 expression. Among its three
isoforms (LAP1, LAP2, and LIP) [35], LAP1 and LAP2
are transcriptional activators, while LIP functions as a
repressor due to its antagonism for LAP [17]. Because of
the existence of three C/EBPβ isoforms, the function of C/
EBPβ in cancer progression is complex. C/EBPβ (LAP1)
can promote mammary epithelial cell differentiation [36],
whereas C/EBPβ (LAP2) transforms normal mammary
epithelial cells and induces EMT in culture [24]; LIP also
promotes EMT in breast cancer and esophageal squamous
cell carcinomas [18, 21, 24]. Dysregulation of C/EBPβ
is markedly correlated with the malignancy of several
tumors, including gliomas, Wilm’s tumors and renal cell
carcinomas [37-39]. In the present study, we analyzed
the protein expression of LAP1, LAP2 and LIP in human
primary HCC samples and showed that although LAP1
and LAP2 could be detected, the expression of LIP was
barely detectable using the same conditions. Moreover,
the LAP1 protein was significantly downregulated in
HCC tissues compared with matched non-cancerous liver
tissues, whereas LAP2 protein levels were similar. These
findings indicate that LAP1 plays an important role in the
regulation of ORM2 and HCC progression.
C/EBPβ upregulates ORM2 expression by directly
bind to its promoter region [15]. The three isoforms of
C/EBPβ have different transcriptional activity [23]. In
this study, we verified that both LAP1 and LAP2 could
activate the ORM2 promoter and upregulate ORM2
expression, while LIP had no effect on ORM2 promoter
activity. Subsequent experiments showed that LAP1
repressed the in vitro migration and invasion of HCC cells
via regulation of ORM2 expression. Moreover, C/EBPβ
expression positively correlated with ORM2 expression
in HCC tissues.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that ORM2
represses the metastatic potential of HCC cells in vivo
and in vitro. LAP1/2 activates ORM2 expression via
directly binding to the ORM2 promoter and repressing
the in vitro migration and invasion of HCC cells at least
partially through ORM2. Thus, these results provide novel
potential targets for the treatment and prevention of HCC
metastasis.

formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C, and then reversed with
1 M glycine for 5 min at 37°C. Then, after washing with
1× PBS buffer, the cells were harvested in Tissue Protein
Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific), incubated on ice
for 5 min, and centrifuged at 2, 000 x g for 5 min. The
sediments were suspended in nuclei lyses buffer, and the
DNA was crushed into fragments of 1, 000 base pairs
by sonication. Antibodies against C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. USA) were added using protein A/G
agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated overnight at
4°C. After reversing the crosslink, the DNA was isolated
and used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Primers for the PCR of the ORM2 promoter are as
follows: forward, 5’-AAATCTGTGGACTCACACG-3’
and reverse, 5’-TGACACAATCCTGCCAG-3’.

In vitro migration and invasion assays
A total of 1×106 cells were seeded into the upper
chamber of a transwell (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA)
in serum-free media, while the lower chamber of the
transwell contained DMEM with 10% FBS. After 12 h or
36 h of incubation, the cells in the upper chamber were
removed. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for
30 min, stained using Giemsa solution and quantified.

In vivo metastasis assays
Six-week-old BALB/C-nu/nu nude male mice
were randomly divided into groups. All animals were
maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions.
For the in vivo tumor metastasis assay, 1×106 cells
stably expressing ORM2 and the pWPXL-control were
orthotopically injected into the left hepatic lobe. After 4
weeks, all mice were euthanized. The livers and lungs
were collected and fixed in 10% neutral phosphatebuffered formalin. The samples were embedded in paraffin
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The experiments
were performed according to the guidelines approved
by the Shanghai Medical Experimental Animal Care
Commission.

Immunohistochemistry
The 236 pairs of HCC tissue samples were obtained
from the Qidong Liver Cancer and stored at -80°C. AntiORM2 polyclonal antibody (ab16046) was purchased
from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and the anti-C/EBPβ
polyclonal antibody (sc-150) was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The immunohistochemistry
and signal evaluation were performed according to our
previously described procedures [40]. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients, and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University.

Plasmid constructs, lentivirus production, and cell
transfection
Full-length human ORM2, LAP1, LAP2 and LIP
gene sequences were PCR amplified and cloned into
