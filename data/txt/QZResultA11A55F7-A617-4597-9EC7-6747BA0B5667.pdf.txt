Abstract
Early exposure to xenoestrogens may predispose to breast
cancer risk later in adult life. It is likely that long-lived, selfregenerating epithelial progenitor cells are more susceptible
to these exposure injuries over time and transmit the injured
memory through epigenetic mechanisms to their differentiated progeny. Here, we used progenitor-containing mammospheres as an in vitro exposure model to study this epigenetic
effect. Expression profiling identified that, relative to control
cells, 9.1% of microRNAs (82 of 898 loci) were altered in
epithelial progeny derived from mammospheres exposed to
a synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol. Repressive chromatin
marks, trimethyl Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and
dimethyl Lys9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2), were found at a
down-regulated locus, miR-9-3, in epithelial cells preexposed
to diethylstilbestrol. This was accompanied by recruitment of
DNA methyltransferase 1 that caused an aberrant increase in
DNA methylation of its promoter CpG island in mammosphere-derived epithelial cells on diethylstilbestrol preexposure. Functional analyses suggest that miR-9-3 plays a role in
the p53-related apoptotic pathway. Epigenetic silencing of this
gene, therefore, reduces this cellular function and promotes
the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Promoter hypermethylation of this microRNA may be a hallmark for early
breast cancer development, and restoration of its expression
by epigenetic and microRNA-based therapies is another viable
option for future treatment of this disease. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Prolonged exposure to xenoestrogens, or environmental estrogens, may be linked to breast cancer risk (1, 2). These
environmental chemicals can mimic the actions of estrogens
that negatively influence the differentiation of breast epithelial
cells and promote the development of breast neoplasms (1–4).
The growth of f60% of breast tumors depends on estrogen
stimulation. This action is mediated via nuclear hormone
receptors (genomic functions) that activate the transcription of
target genes for cellular proliferation (4–6). Alternatively, estro-

gens stimulate the phosphorylation of membrane-bound proteins
that subsequently activate signaling of mitogen-activated kinase
proteins (nongenomic functions) for regulating downstream gene
transcription (4).
As of today, environmental screening has identified many
xenoestrogens that potentially support abnormal development of
breast epithelial cells (1, 2). Among these chemicals are plasticizers
(e.g., bisphenol A), disinfectants (e.g., o-nonylphenol), pesticides
(e.g., permethrin and heptachlor), flame retardants (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ether), and heavy metals (e.g., cadmium and
arsenite; refs. 7–9). Exposure to these chemicals is probably a major
causal factor in the increased incidence of breast cancer. For
example, diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen, was prescribed to
prevent miscarriages between the 1940s and the 1960s (10).
Whereas diethylstilbestrol was subsequently shown to have no
efficacy in preventing early delivery, these mothers had a 20% to
25% increased risk of breast cancer (11). Moreover, daughters
prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol were found to have a 2.5fold risk of developing breast cancer after age 40 years (12).
Animal and epidemiologic studies suggest an imprinting
phenomenon in which early developmental exposure to xenoestrogens potentiates a carcinogenic process later in adult life (1, 3,
13, 14). Increasing evidence indicates that epigenetic mechanisms
play an important role in transmitting this molecular information
from parental cells to the progeny (3, 15). This process involves
remodeling of DNA structure without altering the nucleotide
sequence itself (16). Frequent epigenetic changes are DNA
methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails
observed in the promoter CpG islands of silent genes in many types
of cancer (17).
Although studies of xenoestrogen-induced epigenetic modifications primarily rely on animal models (13, 18), the challenge
encountered is the lack of an in vitro system that can be used to
validate these exposure effects on human cells. We have recently
established a breast progenitor model for epigenetic studies of
xenoestrogen exposure (19). These progenitors are slow-dividing,
immature cells that are capable of self-renewal and, in response to
signaling, differentiate into different types of breast epithelial cells
(20). Because of their long lifespan, breast progenitors are more
susceptible to environmental injuries and may transmit the
memory of these injuries through epigenetic mechanisms to
differentiating progeny. In our previous study, DNA methylation
profiling of epithelial progeny derived from progenitors exposed to
17h-estradiol detected hypermethylated loci in 0.5% of proteincoding genes (19). Here, we extended this exposure study to
noncoding microRNA genes and found that epigenetic alteration of
microRNAs was also induced in epithelial cells having a prior
exposure to diethylstilbestrol and other xenoestrogens. Promoter
hypermethylation of one candidate gene, miR-9-3, was found in

breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Functional analysis
suggested that the p53-ARF apoptotic pathway is partially
attenuated by this epigenetic silencing in breast cancer cells. This
in vitro model, therefore, provides a new paradigm to test potential
xenoestrogens in epithelial cells and is useful to uncover novel
tumor suppressors important for regulating early breast cancer
development.

Materials and Methods
Tissue samples and cell culture. Breast samples were collected by the
tissue procurement service in accordance with the protocols approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Ohio State University. For isolation of
breast progenitors, normal tissue sections were obtained from individuals
undergoing reduction mammoplasties mainly due to macromastia. These
tissues were dissociated mechanically and enzymatically, and single cells
were isolated and grown into mammospheres (2,000-10,000 per mammosphere) in ultralow attachment plates (Corning) in serum-free mammary
epithelial growth medium (Cambrex) as described (21). These mammospheres could be repopulated in the suspension culture up to six cell
passages (21). Mammospheres were then exposed to 70 nmol/L diethylstilbestrol (Sigma) or DMSO (control) in phenol red-free medium for 3 weeks
(medium changed twice weekly). After the exposure, mammospherecontaining progenitors were placed on a collagen substratum (BD
Biosciences) in phenol red-free medium for 2 to 3 weeks. Under this
culture condition, progenitors were differentiated into breast epithelial cells
as described previously (19). Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-134,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435S, T47D, and SKBR3 and the immortalized
epithelial MCF-10A cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection for in vitro studies.
Immunofluorescence staining. Approximately 2,000 mammospherederived epithelial cells (MDEC)-seeded collagen I-coated coverslips were
fixed with methanol/acetone for 10 min. After blocking with 2.5% bovine
serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h, they were incubated with anti-estrogen
receptor (ER)-a antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4jC. The
corresponding secondary FITC-conjugated antibody was applied followed
by 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (Molecular Probes) for the nuclei.
Photographs were captured by Zeiss fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). The
percentages of ER-a subcellular localization were calculated in 10 different
optical fields (f10 cells per field) by two independent researchers.
microRNA microarray analysis. Total RNA of three independent MDEC
samples was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (5 Ag/sample) was biotin-labeled during reverse
transcription using random hexamers. Hybridization was carried out with a
microRNA microarray panel (Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer
Center, version 2.0), which contains probes for 898 microRNAs of Homo
sapiens (including both precursor and mature forms) spotted in replicate
with annotated active sites. Hybridization signals were detected with the
streptavidin-Alexa 647 conjugate. Processed slides were scanned using a
Perkin-Elmer ScanArray XL5K scanner with the laser set to 635 nm, at fixed
PMT setting, and scan resolution of 10 nm.
Microarray images were analyzed by using GENEPIX PRO. Average values
of the replicates spots of each microRNA were normalized and analyzed in
BRB-Array Tools version 3.2.3. After excluding negative values with
hybridization intensity below background, normalization was done by
using the median normalization method and normalized to median array as
reference. We identified genes that were differentially expressed among
groups using Student’s t test or F tests, and genes are considered
statistically significant if their parametric P < 0.05. To increase stringency,
we considered only microRNA probes that had at least 1.3-fold differences
in intensities out of the replicates in the array.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA (2 Ag) was reverse
transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) (SuperScript III; Invitrogen) for coding
genes and microRNA-specific primers (ThermoScript; Invitrogen) for
microRNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was done
by using SYBR Green dye chemistry (Applied Biosystems) on a 7500 Real-

www.aacrjournals.org

time PCR System apparatus (Applied Biosystems). Coding gene expression
was measured by the DDCt method using b-actin as the internal control.
microRNA expression was calculated by absolute quantitation of standard
curves of cloned PCR products. The curves were amplified from universal
human reference RNA (Stratagene) with primers for each microRNA.
Results of microRNA expression are presented as the relative copy number
of the given microRNA to U6 reference control for each sample.
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR. Cells were fixed
with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The resultant DNAprotein complexes were sonicated followed by immunoprecipitation using
Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) coated with control IgG antibody or with
respect antibodies for H3K27me3 (Upstate), H3K9me2 (Abcam), and DNA
methyltransferase 1 (Imgenex). Pull-down DNAs were used for chromatin
immunoprecipitation-PCR assays. PCR primers targeting 3.5 kb upstream to
1.0 kb downstream regions of the predicted miR-9-3 transcriptional start
site (TSS) were used to amplify DNA samples using the SYBR Green-based
detection method (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative values measured by a
standard curve (50-0.08 ng; 5-fold dilution; R2 > 0.99) of input DNA amplified
with the same primer set. Results are presented as the mean F SE of two
independent experiments.
Quantitative methylation analysis using MassARRAY. Genomic DNA
(1 Ag) was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EZ DNA Methylation kit
(ZYMO Research). Bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified with specific
primers for the miR-9-3 CpG island. The MassARRAY platform was used
to perform quantitative methylation analysis (Sequenom). This system uses
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in combination with RNA base cleavage (MassCLEAVE). Details of
quantitative analysis of methylation status have been described elsewhere
(22). The average value of the CpG units for each patient tumor was
calculated. Patients were separated based on ER status and the difference
between groups was assessed by the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test using
SigmaPlot 11.
Inhibitor treatments. MCF-7 cells were treated with 1 Amol/L 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine for 5 days in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
6 ng/AL insulin. During the final 72 h of the 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine
treatment, cells were hormone deprived by culturing in phenol red-free
MEM supplemented with 4% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum.
During the final 24 h of hormone deprivation, cells were treated with
1 Amol/L trichostatin A and/or an ER antagonist, ICI182780, or DMSO
followed by treatment with DMSO (control) or 70 nmol/L diethylstilbestrol
for 6 h. Total RNA was collected for qRT-PCR analysis.
Transfection studies. MCF-7 cells (106) were seeded in a 10 cm dish and
transfected the next day with two predesigned matured mimics of miR-9-3
(Dharmacon), miR-9 (5¶-uc\uuugguuaucuagcug\uauga) and miR-9* (5¶ua\aagcuagauaaccgaa\agu), using the Fugene HD (Roche). After 48 h,
transfected cells were used for gene expression analysis and apoptosis assay.
Scrambled oligonucleotide (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control.
Expression microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted from
transfectants and control cells, and the quality of RNA samples was
assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA was amplified and labeled for
hybridization to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
arrays (Affymetrix). The quality of hybridization data was assessed using
normalized unscaled SE and relative log expression statistics (23) and
MAS5.0 report quality scores. Normalized unscaled SE and relative log
expression statistics were computed using the affyPLM package in
Bioconductor. Expression values were computed from the raw (.cel)
Affymetrix files and normalized using robust multichip averaging RMA
(Bioconductor release 2.4.0). The list of the potential miR-9-3 targets was
generated from the comparison results of the expression array data and the
information from miRanda3 and TargetScan.4
The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis version 6.5 (Ingenuity Systems)5 was
used to analyze the list of the potential miR-9-3 targets. Filtering was done

Results and Discussion
We modified a suspension culture protocol (19, 21) to enrich
and propagate breast progenitors. These cells (n = 2,000-10,000)

to a pharmacologically relevant dose (70 nmol/L; ref. 24) of

diethylstilbestrol for 3 weeks (Fig. 1A). After the exposure,
mammospheres placed on two-dimensional collagen substratum
with the removal of diethylstilbestrol were differentiating into
epithelial cells for 2 to 3 weeks (19). Immunofluorescence images
were used to determine whether changes of ER-a localization
occurred in these MDECs (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our previous
report on 17h-estradiol-preexposed MDECs (19), nuclear ER-a
was preferentially observed in diethylstilbestrol-preexposed
MDECs (71%) relative to control cells (12%; n = 5; P < 0.001).
In contrast, this nuclear localization is usually transient and

cyclical in normal breast epithelial cells in response to
physiologic stimulation (e.g., menstrual cycle; ref. 25). For
example, on ligand stimulation of DMSO-preexposed MDECs
with 70 nmol/L diethylstilbestrol, translocation of ER-a to the
nucleus took place rapidly within 5 min, and ER-a was reshuffled
back to the cytoplasm after f60 min (Fig. 1C). More cycles of
nuclear translocation occurred and might gradually phase out
in the post-stimulation period (25). It is therefore unusual to
observe nuclear internalization of ER-a without ligand stimulation, such as in diethylstilbestrol-preexposed MDECs. This

persistent retention of nuclear ER-a could be a heritable event,
reminiscent of that observed in ER-a–positive breast cancer cells
(e.g., MCF-7; ref. 26). We speculate that, as a result of continuous
exposure to xenoestrogen, the dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of ER-a could be disrupted due to a defect involving
Crm1, a protein regulating the nuclear export of hormone
receptors (27). It is likely such a defect was transmitted to the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

progeny derived from progenitor cells continuously exposed to
diethylstilbestrol. However, further studies need to be conducted
to support the above hypothesis.
To determine whether this heritable effect altered the transcriptome of microRNA genes, we conducted expression microarray analysis of three sets of primary MDECs with a prior history
of diethylstilbestrol exposure. Relative to control cells, 9.1% (82 of

Epigenetic characterization of miR-9-3 was further studied in
detail because this microRNA was previously implicated in
breast tumorigenesis (28). Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qRTPCR assays showed that increased levels (2- to 23-fold; P <
0.001) of the polycomb EZH2-mediated chromatin modification,
H3K27me3 (29, 30), were observed at the 1.66 to 0.47 kb
upstream region of miR-9-3 transcription start site in diethylstilbestrol-preexposed MDECs relative to control cells (Fig. 3).

Enrichment (2- to 48-fold; P < 0.001) of another repressive
chromatin mark, H3K9me2, was also seen in the 1.28 to 0.65 kb
upstream region of the transcription start site. Increased
recruitment (2- to 7-fold; P < 0.001) of DNA methyltransferase
1 was noted, suggesting that DNA methylation was gradually
accumulated in the CpG island of miR-9-3. The enrichment area
of H3K27me3 is usually more widespread than that of H3K9me2,
consistent with the patterns previously reported by MacGarvey

Figure 6. Direct and indirect target genes of miR-9-3. A, microarray profiles of miR-9-3 targets. MCF-7 cells were transfected with two forms (miR-9 or miR-9* mimics)

and miR-9* ) were separately transfected into MCF-7 cells for 48 h. Apoptosis assay was done, as described in Materials and Methods, on days 4 and 7 after the
transfection. Scrambled oligonucleotides were used as negative controls. Mean F SE (n = 3). ***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05 (Student’s t test), compared with

and colleagues (29). Furthermore, the enrichment of DNA
methyltransferase 1 is evidently lower relative to that of
H3K27me3 and H3K9me2, supporting the notion that repressive
chromatin marks usually take place first and then signal DNA
methylation to be further accumulated in the region that
undergoes permanent, heritable silencing (30–32).
Methylation profiles of 14 CpG units (1-3 CpG sites per unit)
within this island were surveyed by MassARRAY (Fig. 4A ).
Compared with control cells, increased methylation at several
CpG units was evident in diethylstilbestrol-preexposed MDECs.
However, this level of accumulation (10-50%) was less obvious in
diethylstilbestrol-preexposed MDECs compared with high methylation levels (30-97%) observed in six breast cancer cell lines (except
T47D) and one immortalized line (MCF10A). Moreover, we
observed that, compared with control MDECs, the expression
levels of miR-9-3 were significantly lower in these cell lines (P <
0.001; Fig. 4B) and in MDECs preexposed to other xenoestrogens
(Supplementary Fig. S1). These results support our hypothesis that
hypermethylation of miR-9-3 CpG island is associated with the
silencing of this microRNA locus. In addition, we believe that
diethylstilbestrol preexposure at the mammosphere stage may
attenuate the active transcription of miR-9-3. Repressive chromatin
of this locus is subsequently established and sets the stage for
heritable silencing. This programmed repression during epithelial
differentiation leads to an increased susceptibility to stochastic
de novo methylation, which in turn may act as ‘‘seeds’’ to trigger
more methylation accumulation (33). Extending this in vitro
observation, we found that 32.4% of 102 primary breast tumors
analyzed by MassARRAY exhibited extensive promoter hypermethylation in the upstream region of the CpG islands, whereas
13 uninvolved, normal controls showed little or no methylation
(Fig. 4C). Statistical analysis further revealed this epigenetic
event preferentially occurring in ER-a–positive tumors (P = 0.001;
Fig. 4D).
This result implies that promoter hypermethylation of miR-9-3 is
associated with the ER-a signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.
We have shown previously that persistent deregulation of the ER-a
signaling may lead to permanent silencing of downstream target
genes that is maintained by promoter hypermethylation (19, 34,
35). We therefore suggest that diethylstilbestrol, as an estrogenic
ligand (see Fig. 1C), may activate an ER-a–mediated signaling
pathway resulting in the epigenetic repression of miR-9-3. To test
this hypothesis, we first treated three ER-a–positive (MCF-7, MDAMB-134, and T47D) breast cancer cell lines with a demethylating
agent, 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (1 Amol/L), and/or a histone
deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (1 Amol/L; Fig. 5A). Partial
restoration of the miR-9-3 expression was observed when these cell
lines were treated with either agent. The combined treatment of
5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A synergistically restored
the expression of this microRNA gene. When diethylstilbestrol
(70 nmol/L) was subsequently added to these treated cells, the
repression (2- to 14-fold) of miR-9-3 occurred again at 6 h of the
estrogenic treatment. Surprisingly, when ER-a–negative cell lines
(MCF-10A, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435S, and SKBR3; Fig. 5B) were
similarly treated with these epigenetic agents, we also observed the
suppression of miR-9-3 by diethylstilbestrol. One explanation is
that, without the mediation of hormone receptors, diethylstilbestrol might act through nongenomic pathways to epigenetically
silence this microRNA gene in ER-a–negative cells (4). In addition,
we cannot rule out the possibility that the combined treatment of
5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A leads to reactivation of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

ER-a expression in these ER-a–negative breast cancer cells (36).
This reactivating ER-a may, in turn, repress the miR-9-3 expression.
To definitely prove that epigenetic repression of miR-9-3 is
modulated via the ER-a–dependent pathway, we conducted an
experiment by additionally treating ER-a–positive MCF-7 cells with
an ER antagonist, ICI182780, which promotes the degradation of
ER-a only (ref. 37; Fig. 5C). Again, diethylstilbestrol could repress
the reexpression of miR-9-3 in MCF-7 cells treated with 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A (lanes 6, 10, and 14). This
suppression, however, was partially abrogated in MCF-7 cells when
the synthesis of ER-a could be blocked by ICI182780 (e.g. lanes 4, 8,
and 12 in C). Furthermore, we observed that, compared with the
expression level of control MDECs (normal) in Fig. 4B, diethylstilbestrol-mediated miR-9-3 repression could be completely restored
in cells treated with 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine, trichostatin A, and
ICI182780 (lane 16). Although the pharmacologic mechanism
among these compounds is complicated, our results suggest that
ER-a indeed plays a key role in diethylstilbestrol-induced
epigenetic silencing of miR-9-3. Taken together, our findings
suggest that diethylstilbestrol may act through the ER-a–dependent pathway to repress miR-9-3. In the absence of hormone
receptors, this epigenetic repression can alternatively be mediated
via an ER-a–independent pathway.
To determine the roles of miR-9-3 silencing in breast
tumorigenesis, we assessed the function of this microRNA gene
in a knock-in study. MCF-7 cells, which have the epigenetically
down-regulated miR-9-3, were transiently transfected with a
mature mimic, miR-9. Microarray expression profiling was used
to determine target genes of miR-9-3 in transfected versus control
cells (Fig. 6A). A total of 70 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated
protein-coding genes were identified (1.5-fold alteration) as
putative targets of miR-9-3 (Supplementary Table S2). A similar
expression profile was also obtained when MCF-7 cells was
transfected with another mimic, miR-9*. Of these differentially
regulated microRNAs, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified 8 upregulated genes (CHMP28, ARFGEF1, HES1, KIAA1128, BTG2,
SIRT1, PHF20L1, and CUL4A ) and 3 down-regulated genes
(NAP1L1, SLC6A6, and COL15A1) that were significantly associated with the p53 signaling pathway (P = 0.046; Fig. 6B). qRT-PCR
assays were extended to analyze in 11 candidate genes associated
with this signaling network, including 4 original loci (SLC6A6,
ARFGEF1, SIRT1, and PHF20L1) identified by this microarray
analysis (Fig. 6C, top). Except for SLC6A6, the expression of the
other 10 genes was up-regulated in MCF-7 cells transfected with
the miR-9 mimic (P < 0.001). In contrast, these 10 genes were
down-regulated when miR-9-3 was epigenetically silenced in
MDECs preexposed to diethylstilbestrol (Fig. 6C, bottom; P < 0.01).
Of these genes directly or indirectly regulated by miR-9-3, ARF
and SIRT1 are known to be involved in p53-mediated apoptosis
(38, 39). Inactivation of ARF can reduce apoptosis and enhance
proliferation in cancer cells (38). Induction of SIRT1 contributes
to p53-mediated apoptosis by stabilizing p53 (39). However, this
apoptotic activity (5- to 10-fold relative to control cells; P < 0.001)
could be restored when the functional miR-9-3 was reintroduced
to MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 6D).
In conclusion, we have identified a microRNA gene, miR-9-3,
which is frequently hypermethylated in breast cancer. One
potential causal factor leading to this epigenetic repression is the
prolonged exposure of breast progenitor cells to xenoestrogens.
In our example, diethylstilbestrol acts as an estrogenic ligand
that activates either genomic or nongenomic pathways to

mediate gene transcription through down-regulation of the
target microRNA, miR-9-3. Persistent activation of this signaling
activity may further establish a repressive heterochromatin
environment in the promoter CpG island region of this microRNA. Accumulation of DNA methylation later occurs in the
region and leaves the heritable hallmark in differentiated
progeny. Because miR-9-3 plays a role in regulating apoptosis,
epigenetic silencing of this gene may promote proliferation of
cancer cells. Restoration of its expression by the combined
epigenetic and microRNA-based therapies, therefore, could be an
additional approach for future treatment of breast cancer.
