ABSTRACT
We designed and synthesized two novel nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) analogues
of the anticancer agent 6-((7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)hexan-1-ol
(NBDHEX). The new compounds, namely MC3165 and MC3181, bear one and two
oxygen atoms within the hydroxy-containing alkyl chain at the C4 position of the NBD
scaffold, respectively. This insertion did not alter the chemical reactivity with reduced
glutathione, while it conferred a remarkable increase in water solubility. MC3181 was
more selective than NBDHEX towards the target protein, glutathione transferase P1-1,
and highly effective in vitro against a panel of human melanoma cell lines, with IC50
in the submicromolar-low micromolar range. Interestingly, the cellular response to
MC3181 was cell-type-specific; the compound triggered a JNK-dependent apoptosis in
the BRAF-V600E-mutated A375 cells, while it induced morphological changes together
with an increase in melanogenesis in BRAF wild-type SK23-MEL cells.
MC3181 exhibited a remarkable therapeutic activity against BRAF-V600Emutant xenografts, both after intravenous and oral administration. Outstandingly, no
treatment-related signs of toxicity were observed both in healthy and tumor-bearing
mice after single and repeated administrations.
Taken together, these results indicate that MC3181 may represent a potential
novel therapeutic opportunity for BRAF-mutated human melanoma, while being safe
and water-soluble and thus overcoming all the critical aspects of NBDHEX in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

widely-expressed GSTM2-2 [23], and from having poor
water solubility, which limits its oral bioavailability and
hinders the development of drug formulations suitable
to parenteral administration. These findings led us to
search for novel NBDHEX analogues with a better
pharmacological profile.
Based on the crystal structure of NBDHEX bound to
either GSTP1-1 or GSTM2-2 [24], we recently designed,
synthesized and screened for water solubility, GSTP1-1
selectivity and in vitro tumor cell cytotoxicity, 40 new
NBDHEX analogues [25]. As a further development of
these studies, here we report the synthesis and chemical
characterization of two additional NBDHEX analogues,
namely MC3165 and MC3181; they are characterized
by the presence of one and two oxygen atoms within the
hydroxy-containing alkyl chain at the C4 position of the
NBD scaffold, respectively. These compounds have been
designed with the aim of increasing the water-solubility
while minimizing the changes into the NBD nucleus, to
avoid any significant drop of cytotoxic potency. Both
compounds have been assayed for water solubility,
chemical stability and ability to form a distinctive
σ-complex intermediate with GSH [16]. Moreover, we
examined their inhibition strength towards both GSTP11 and GSTM2-2, and the degree of selectivity towards
GSTP1-1. The most promising compound, MC3181,
was further studied in vitro both for ability to affect the
interaction between GSTP1-1 and JNK1 or TRAF2, and
for antitumor efficacy against a panel of human melanoma
cell lines. Finally, host toxicity and antitumor efficacy of
MC3181 upon its intravenous (i.v) or oral administration
were assessed in vivo in healthy animals and mice bearing
different human melanoma xenografts.

Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive skin
cancer, and its incidence continues to rise worldwide. In
stage 0, I and II (localized) disease, surgical excision of the
primary tumor is associated with a cure rate of over 95%.
However, in stage III (regional lymph node metastasis) and
stage IV (distant metastasis) disease, surgical interventions
are of limited value, and systemic therapy becomes the
only treatment option. Unlike dacarbazine, temozolomide
and interleukin-2, the recently approved ipilimumab and
vemurafenib drugs improve median overall survival in
metastatic melanoma patients [1–3], but nonetheless there
is still a high unmet need for more effective and safer
systemic therapies.
Both intrinsic and acquired mechanisms are
thought to be responsible for the multidrug-resistant
phenotype of melanoma cells. Among these, overexpres­
sion of glutathione transferase (formerly glutathione
S-transferase, GST) P1-1 may play an important role.
This dimeric cytosolic protein is overexpressed in many
untreated human tumors, including melanoma, and is well
known to catalyze the detoxification of some electrophilic
anticancer drugs via conjugation to reduced glutathione
(GSH) [4–8]. Furthermore, GSTP1-1 is often co-expressed
with the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1)
in melanoma, and acts in a combined fashion with this
export pump to protect melanoma cells from some
cytotoxic agents [9, 10].
Beside its detoxifying function, GSTP1-1 has a
regulatory role in signal transduction, interacting with
different members of the Mitogen-Activate Protein Kinase
(MAPK) pathway. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK)-mediated MAPK signaling occurs in response to
several anticancer agents including those causing DNA
breaks, such as temozolomide [11]. The association of
GSTP1-1 with both JNK1 and the up-stream adaptor
protein TNF-Receptor Associated Factor 2 (TRAF2)
results in impairment of the MAPK pathway, leading to
inhibition of apoptosis [12–15].
This evidence prompted us to synthesize and screen
non-GSH-peptidomimetic GSTP1-1 inhibitors bearing
a nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) moiety. Among them, the
most effective was NBDHEX. This compound behaves
as a “mechanism-based inhibitor” of GSTP1-1 [16]
leading to the activation of the apoptotic pathway in a
variety of human cancer cell lines [17–20]. We recently
demonstrated that NBDHEX exhibits in vitro cytotoxicity
at low micromolar concentrations, and significant in vivo
therapeutic activity towards Me501 and A375 human
melanomas [21]. In addition, NBDHEX synergize
with temozolomide both in vitro and in vivo, without
worsening the myelotoxic activity of the methylating
agent [22]. However, NBDHEX suffers from relatively
low target selectivity being a high-affinity ligand of the

RESULTS
MC3165 and MC3181 preparation
As described in Fig. 1, MC3165 and MC3181
were obtained by a nucleophilic displacement reaction
between the commercial 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo[c]
[1,2,5]oxadiazole and the 2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethanol
and
the
2-(2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol,
respectively. The mercapto alcohols were prepared
from the commercially available 2-(2-chloroethoxy)
ethanol
and
2-(2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol
through a reaction with thiourea in refluxing water
under an inert atmosphere, followed by the basic
hydrolysis of the hydrochloride intermediates under
reflux conditions. The 2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethanol
and the 2-(2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol were
finally reacted with the 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]
oxadiazole in an ethanol:water (1:3) mixture, in the
presence of pyridine at room temperature, providing the
desired compounds, MC3165 and MC3181.

rapidly extruded from the cell by specific membrane
transporters such as MRP1/2 [26], was evaluated
spectrophotometrically. Addition of an excess of GSH
to MC3165, MC3181 or NBDHEX solutions in 0.1 M
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 25°C, caused
only a small decrease in the absorbance at 430 nm (less
than 15% decrease of the absorbance value within 1 h),
and a comparable increase in the absorbance band in the
350 nm region (Fig. 2A). Collectively these results
indicate a negligible spontaneous reactivity of all of the
examined compounds towards GSH.

The molecular weights, extinction coefficients, and
the aqueous solubility profiles at different pH values of
MC3165, MC3181 and their parent compound, NBDHEX,
are reported in Table 1.
Replacement of the n-hexanol chain of NBDHEX
with a 2-(ethoxy)ethanol moiety (MC3165) led to a 20fold increase in water solubility at all the examined pH
values. Insertion of two oxygen atoms within the hydroxycontaining alkyl chain of NBDHEX (MC3181) further
improved hydrophilicity resulting in a more than 50-fold
increase in aqueous solubility.

sulphur atom influenced the stability of the σ-complex,
which was in the rank order NBDHEX > MC3181 >
MC3165 (Fig. 2B).

values of each compound towards the catalytic activity
of both GSTP1-1 and GSTM2-2 were determined, and
used for calculation of a selectivity index (SI, IC50GSTP1-1/
IC50GSTM2-2 ratio, see Table 2). While MC3165 had a SI
comparable to that of its parent compound (Table 2),
MC3181 displayed a 3-fold lower SI than NBDHEX,
thus indicating a greater selectivity towards GSTP1-1.
Based on these findings, MC3181 was selected for further
in vitro and in vivo investigations as a potential therapeutic
antimelanoma agent.

MC3181 disrupts protein-protein interactions
involving GSTP1-1

of the GSTP1-1-protein complexes leading to Kds > 5–10
μM.

We recently demonstrated that NBDHEX is able to
disrupt the interaction between GSTP1-1 and the MAPK
pathway members JNK1 [14] and TRAF2 [15]. Therefore,
the effects of MC3181 on these protein-protein complexes
were evaluated. Under our experimental conditions,
GSTP1-1 resulted bound to JNK1α2 and TRAF2 with Kd
values in the nanomolar range (0.42 ± 0.02 μM and 0.28 ±
0.02 μM, respectively; Fig. 3 and Table 3). The presence
of GSH remarkably affected the binding properties of
GSTP1-1, shifting the Kd values for JNK1α2 and TRAF2
to 2.2 ± 0.1 μM and 3.0 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. Moreover,
the addition of MC3181, further hindered the formation

In vitro antitumor efficacy of MC3181 towards a
panel of human melanoma cell lines
The antitumor efficacy of MC3181 towards five
cultured human melanoma cell lines was compared
with that of NBDHEX. A375, G-361, MALME-3M and
IST-MEL-1 are cell lines harboring the BRAF-V600E
mutation, whereas SK23-MEL are BRAF wild-type
melanoma cells. Results, summarized in Table 4, show that
the IC50 values of MC3181 were in the low micromolar
range (0.8–2.4 μM), and comparable to that recorded for
NBDHEX

A375 and SK23-MEL cells

the number of cells in Sub-G1 phase (Fig. 5B and 5C), and
by about 50% the increase of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5C),
elicited by a 24 hrs exposure to MC3181. Collectively,
these data confirm the role of JNK in the apoptotic
response triggered by MC3181 in A375 cells.

A strong inhibition of cell proliferation was
observed in both A375 and SK23-MEL cells treated with
MC3181 at concentrations about 4-fold higher than their
IC50 values, i.e. 10 and 7 μM, respectively (Fig. 4A).
Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle perturbations
induced by MC3181 in A375 cells revealed a timedependent increase in the number of cells blocked in the
G2/M phase and a concomitant increase in the amount of
cells in the sub-G1 phase (about 27 and 36% increase after
24 and 48 hrs, respectively; Fig. 4B, left panel and Fig. 5,
panels B and C). A noticeable cell cycle arrest in the G2/M
phase was also observed in MC3181-treated SK23-MEL
cells, whereas the drug-induced increase in the number
of cells in sub-G1 phase was less pronounced than that
recorded in A375 cells (about 10 and 20% increase after
24 and 48 hrs of treatment, respectively; Fig. 4B, right
panel and Fig. 5, panel E). These differences translated
into a different degree of caspase activation; a strong
caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4C, left panel) was observed in
drug-treated A375 cells, while MC3181 induced only a
negligible increase of proteolitic activity in SK23-MEL
cells (Fig. 4C, right panel).
To get better insight into the mechanism of cell
death induced by MC3181, apoptosis was assessed
by flow cytometry upon annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) staining. The analysis was performed after
24 and 48 hrs of exposure to the drug in the A375 cell
line, and after 48 hrs of drug treatment in SK23-Mel
cells, since, in these cells, apoptosis was negligible at
24 hrs. Results of these experiments are summarized in
Figure 5. Early (Ann+/PI-) and late (Ann+/PI+) apoptotic
cell death but not necrosis was recorded in both cell lines.
The percentage of total apoptotic cells in A375 cells
was approximately 23 and 37% at 24 and 48 hrs posttreatment, respectively (Fig. 5, panel A); the percentage
of total apoptotic cells for SK23-Mel cells (Fig. 5, panel
D) was about 20% after 48 hrs of treatment, in agreement
with the results obtained with the PI staining.

MC3181 induces morphological changes in
SK23-MEL cells
SK23-MEL cells are a mixture of spindle and
polydendritic cells expressing markers indicative of
cells at a late stage of melanocyte differentiation. A 48
hrs treatment with MC3181 caused clear morphological
changes, shifting towards a bipolar spindle morphology
(Fig. 5F). As the expression of late markers usually
correlates with an increase of pigment content and a
higher tyrosinase activity [27], we evaluated the impact of
MC3181 treatment on cell tyrosinase activity and melanin
content. Forty-eight hrs exposure to the drug, produced a
significant increase in both melanin content (p < 0.05), and
tyrosinase activity (p < 0.005), (Fig. 5C).

Antitumor efficacy of MC3181 in human
melanoma xenograft models
MC3181 doses and schedules were decided
on the basis of both drug solubility properties and of
explorative toxicology studies carried out in CD-1 mice,
which were treated using either the i.v. or the oral route
of administration. The maximum administrable dose of
MC3181 (i.e. 8 mg/kg), which was dictated by its acqueous
solubility, was given to mice using either the i.v. or the
oral route and according to a q1dx5 schedule for 3 weeks
without inducing apparent gross toxicity signs and weight
loss (data not shown). Moreover, no microscopic differences
were detectable in the structure of all organs between treated
and untreated groups (Fig. 6A and 6B), thus demonstrating
that the compound was safe at the tested dose schedule.
Initially, the antitumor efficacy of MC3181 was
investigated on the fast-growing A375 human melanoma
model implanted s.c. as fragments, to better reproduce
the tumor cell/stromal architecture. Animals (n = 7 mice/
group) were treated i.v. with MC3181 (8mg/kg/d, q1dx5
for three weeks), or i.p. with a reference drug, TMZ (100
mg/kg/d, q1dx5), starting 10 days after tumor implant.
MC3181 and TMZ treatments significantly delayed tumor
growth from day 13 onward (P < 0.05; Fig. 7A, left panel);
moreover, Kaplan–Meier analysis disclosed a significant
increase in survival between treated and control mice
(p < 0.05 for TMZ and p < 0.005 for MC3181, Fig. 7A,
right panel), and fulfilled %ILS values of 53% and 35%
for MC3181- and TMZ-treated animals, respectively.
A second set of experiments was performed in mice
s.c.-injected with SK23-MEL or G-361 human melanoma
cells (n = 6 mice/group), to compare the efficacy of

MC3181 to activate the MAP kinase JNK1. Treatment
of A375 cells caused a sustained increase in JNK
phosphorylation, starting within 1 hour after the addition
of the drug (Fig. 4D, left panel); a more transient phosphoactivation of JNK was observed in SK23-MEL cells,
treated with an equitoxic concentration of MC3181 (Fig.

cells, both treatments induced a certain degree of delay in
tumor growth (Fig. 7B, left panel), but nonetheless effects
appeared quite limited, and did not result in an improvement
in survival (ILS < 20%) (Fig. 7B, right panel).

Conversely, treatment of the BRAF-mutated

data. Indeed, while both administration routes led to
a significant delay in tumor growth, the oral delivery
outperformed the i.v. counterpart, and was also capable
of inducing stabilization and regression of the disease in

receiving MC3181 orally, 50% of animals were still alive
at the end of the observation period (Fig. 7C, right panel),
thus clearly indicating the superior antitumor efficacy of
the oral route.
As in the case of in vivo toxicology trials, all of the
animals evaluated in the therapeutic activity experiments
were monitored for signs of drug toxicity by frequent
observation and regular body weight (BW) measurements
over the course of the study (Fig. 8). Overall, MC3181
was tolerated very well, with no signs of adverse
effects and a decrease in BW lower than 3%. Moreover,
macroscopic examination of the vital organs of treated
animals did not reveal any alteration. The reference
compound, TMZ, caused almost 15% of BW loss during
the period of treatment, and a complete recovery only after
its interruption (Fig. 8).

At the end of the observation period, mice
were sacrificed and an autopsy was performed. Gross
examination of internal organs by a stereo-microscope
did not show any significant lesion or metastatic nodules.
Melanoma nodules were analyzed for morphology,
proliferation and apoptosis. SK23-MEL control tumors
showed small, highly proliferating cells (Fig. 9A, left
panel). On the contrary, the MC3181-treated SK23-MEL
tumors mainly contained epithelioid-shaped tumoral
cells, characterized by large eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig.
9A, right panel). In addition, some cells of drug-treated
SK23-MEL xenografts showed melanin production, never
observed in the control tumors.
In A375 tumors, we could not detect significant
differences between the proliferation status of MC3181treated and untreated tumors, as the extensive necrosis

Oncotarget

reduced the sampling areas to the tumor periphery.
However, MC3181 treatment resulted in a significant
increase of JNK phosphorylation and caspase-3 activity
(see Fig. 9B). Moreover, higher apoptosis (about 20%)
was still detectable in MC3181-treated tumor xenografts,
compared to untreated controls (data not shown).

Recently, we designed, synthesized and
characterized 40 new NBDHEX analogues, and found that
the replacement of the hydroxyhexyl portion with an alkyl
chain bearing polar substituents could be associated with a
higher water solubility and a good cytotoxicity, compared
to the parent compound [25]. Therefore, we extended our
analysis to two novel alkyl analogues, named MC3165
and MC3181, which are characterized by the insertion of
one and two oxygen atoms in the hexamethylene chain of
NBDHEX, respectively.
Likewise NBDHEX, these new NBDs do not
spontaneously react with GSH, whereas they form quite
stable σ-complexes with this thiol in the GSTP1-1 active

DISCUSSION
The NBD derivative NBDHEX is a potent GST
inhibitor, which has proven to be highly effective both
in vitro and in vivo in various tumor models, including
human melanoma xenografts [21, 22].

Figure 6: (Continued) (B) Postmortem examination of organs/tissues did not show any microscopic finding
site. Overall, MC3181 showed overt improved chemical and
physical properties compared to NBDHEX, i.e. a remarkable
increase in water solubility and a higher selectivity towards
the target protein, GSTP1-1. This prompted us to further
investigate the mechanism of action of this novel compound,
and to verify its activity at both cellular and in vivo levels.
MC3181 proved to be highly cytotoxic towards a
panel of different human melanoma cell lines, as indicated
by its IC50 values that were comparable, or in some cases
slightly superior, to those recorded for the parent drug,
NBDHEX. In particular, MC3181 efficiently inhibited
proliferation of both the amelanotic and BRAF-mutated
A375 cells, and of the melanotic and BRAF wild-type
SK23-MEL cell line. On the other hand, the drug disclosed

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a different ability in inducing apoptosis in these two cell
lines, suggesting a propensity for MC3181 to exert its
antitumor activity against BRAF-mutated melanoma
cells. Indeed, such observation was confirmed in vivo,
as MC3181 proved not to be very effective in reducing
tumor volume in SK23-MEL xenografts. However,
unlike the untreated ones, MC3181-treated tumors, were
characterized by cells with a large eosinophilic cytoplasm
and producing melanin, consistent with the increased
melanogenesis observed in vitro.
Conversely, in the A375 model, both TMZ and
MC3181 showed a comparable efficacy, but with
remarkable benefits in terms of toxicity profile for
MC3181.

Figure. 7: In vivo antitumor efficacy of MC3181. Mice were treated daily with 8 mg/kg of MC3181, administered intravenously

(-○-) or orally (-●-) for three weeks. Alternatively, animals were treated i.p. with 100 mg/Kg of TMZ for 1 week (-■-). Control, mice were
treated with drug vehicle (PBS) only (-☐-). Tumor growth (left panels) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves (right panels) of: (A) A375

reported the means ± SEM of tumor volumes determined in each group. Data shown for the trials in the A375 xenograft model are from a
single experiment which was repeated twice with similar results; data shown for the trials in the SK23-MEL and G-631 xenograft models
are representative of a single experiment.

Notably, administration of MC3181 in G-361 tumorbearing mice revealed a correlation between its antitumor
activity and the route of administration, as the oral treatment
led not only to a powerful tumor growth inhibition, but also
produced a significant improvement in the overall survival.
Again, it has to be stressed that the treatment-related signs
of toxicity were negligible or completely absent.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

With regard to the mechanism of action, MC3181
appeared to disrupt the interaction of GSTP1-1 with both
JNK and the scaffold protein TRAF2, which is essential
for JNK activation. Indeed, multiple cellular pathways
are implicated in the development of melanoma and drug
resistance, and therefore their inhibition is considered to
be a valid therapeutic strategy for melanoma patients.

addition, some cells shifted towards melanin production (arrows, right panel). (B) P-JNK (6 hrs after treatment with MC3181)
and caspase-3 stains (at the end of MC3181 treatment) (40X magnification) of A375 tumor xenografts. The drug caused a

In particular, the MAP kinase MEK is constitutively
activated in the BRAF mutated cells, and it is a target for
inhibitors [28]. However, melanoma can be also targeted
with selected kinase activators; in fact, several anticancer
agents require the activation of the MAP kinase pathway
mediated by JNK and p38 [29]; accordingly, our evidences
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

confirm that the proapoptotic activity of MC3181 is
dependent on JNK activation.
Another important consequence of our findings is the
possibility to exploit the levels of activated JNK (phosphoJNK) as a biomarker of drug responsiveness to be utilized
for patient selection, and to monitor tumor response.

Collectively, these results indicate that MC3181 is
an agent endowed with a high safety profile and a good
water-solubility, thus overcoming all of the critical aspects
of NBDHEX administration in vivo. As this compound
resulted active upon oral administration, and proved to be
therapeutically effective against BRAF-mutated tumors at
non-toxic doses, it may represent a high compliant new
therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of melanoma
patients.

then, the reaction is refluxed for 18 hrs, always under
an inert atmosphere. The mixture was then cooled at
room temperature, a 5N NaOH solution (15 mL) added
and the reaction refluxed again for 3 hrs. The solution
obtained was acidified at 0–5°C with concentrated HCl
until pH = 4 and the aqueous phase was extracted with
CHCl3 (4 x 40 mL). The combined organic phases were
therefore dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and
evaporated under reduced pressure to provide 1.68 g of
2-(2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol as a colorless oil
that was used in the next step without further purification.

METHODS
Recombinant proteins and chemicals
Human GSTM2-2, GSTP1-1, JNK1a2 and TRAF2
were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as
previously described [14, 15, 30]; protein concentration
was determined using the Lowry colorimetric assay [31].
Unless specified otherwise, all chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l. (Milan, Italy).

Chemistry
Melting points were determined on a Buchi 530
melting point apparatus. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at
400 MHz using a Bruker AC 400 spectrometer; chemical
shifts are reported in δ (ppm) units relative to the internal
reference tetramethylsilane (Me4Si). Mass spectra
were recorded on a API-TOF Mariner by Perspective
Biosystem (Stratford, Texas, USA); samples were injected
by an Harvard pump using a flow rate of 5–10 μL/min,
and infused in the Electrospray system. All compounds
were routinely checked by TLC and 1H-NMR. TLC was
performed on aluminum-backed silica gel plates (Merck
DC, Alufolien Kieselgel 60 F254) with spots visualized
by UV light or using a KMnO4 alkaline solution. All
solvents were reagent grade and, when necessary, were
purified and dried by standard methods. Concentration of
solutions after reactions and extractions involved the use
of a rotary evaporator operating at reduced pressure of ~ 20
Torr. Organic solutions were dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
s.r.l., Milan (Italy) or from TCI Europe N.V., Zwijndrecht
(Belgium), and were of the highest purity. As a rule, samples
prepared for physical and biological studies were dried in
high vacuum over P2O5 for 20h at temperatures ranging
from 25 to 40°C, depending on the sample melting point.

Solubility limits in aqueous buffers
Different amounts of MC3181 and MC3165 were
dissolved in a fixed volume of 0.1M potassium phosphate
buffer pH 7.4, or 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0
or 2.0. The solutions obtained were separated from any
undissolved matter by centrifugation at 15,000 g and
evaluated for drug concentration by recording compound
absorbance at 425 nm, using molar extinction coefficients
calculated at the same wavelength with diluted standard
solutions, prepared in the same matrices.

Reactivity towards GSH

General procedure for the preparation of
2-(2-((7-nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)ethoxy)
ethan-1-ol (MC3165) and 2-(2-(2-((7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]
oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol (MC3181)

The spontaneous reactivity of the NBDs with GSH
was determined at 25°C by recording the UV-visible
spectrum of each compound (40 μM) incubated with 1
mM GSH, in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5,
at different time points.
The ability of GSTP1-1 to stabilize the intermediate
σ-complex formed between GSH and the compounds, was
evaluated by recording the spectrum of each molecule
(40 μM), in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5,

and MALME-3M were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium (EuroClone). G-361 cells were maintained in
Mc Coy’s medium (EuroClone). All culture media were
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland). Growth medium for IST-MEL-1,
G-361 and SK23-MEL, cells was also supplemented
with 25 mM HEPES (Lonza); medium for IST-MEL-1,
MALME-3M and G-361 was also enriched with 1 mM
sodium pyruvate (Lonza). Cultures were maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
For in vitro antitumor efficacy studies, cells (2x104
cells/cm2) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured
for 24 h, after which they were exposed to different
concentrations (0.05–50 μM) of MC3181 or NBDHEX
for 48 h. The IC50 values for each compound were then
evaluated by the SRB assay [33].
The proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects of
MC3181 were evaluated in A375 and SK23-MEL cell
lines seeded in 75 cm2 flask (Corning) at a density of
20,000 cells/cm2. Forty-eight hrs after plating, cells were
exposed to equitoxic concentrations of MC3181 (10
and 7 μM for A375 and SK23-MEL, respectively), then
were harvested at different time points, counted using a
Neubauer Chamber (after 1:1 dilution in Trypan Blue),
and subjected to further analysis.
In a separate set of experiments, the A375 cell line
was exposed to the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μM),
which was added 1 h before the addition of MC3181.

Inhibition of GSTP1-1 and GSTM2-2
conjugation activity
GST activity was determined spectrophotometrically
at 340 nm (ε = 9,600 M-1 cm-1), as previously reported [32].
Inhibition experiments were performed by measuring
GSTP1-1 (20 nM) or GSTM2-2 (5 nM) activities in the
presence of various amounts of the selected NBD derivative
(from 0.1 to 20 μM with GSTP1-1, and from 0.005 and 1
μM with GSTM2-2). Fifty percent inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values were calculated by fitting the data to Equation
1, where ν is the percentage of the saturated binding
sites; [P]t is the total GST concentration and [L]t is the
total inhibitor concentration, assuming a 1:1 interaction
stoichiometry between the inhibitor and one GST subunit,
as well as that the binding sites are equal and independent.

Protein-protein interaction
The protein-protein interaction between GSTP11 and JNK1α2 or TRAF2 recombinant proteins was
evaluated in the absence or in the presence of either 1
mM GSH or a mixture of 1 mM GSH and 8 μM MC3181,
as previously described [14, 15]. The equilibrium
dissociation constants (Kd) of the complexes were
calculated by fitting the binding curves to the Equation
1, where ν is the percentage of the saturated binding sites,
[P]t is the total concentrations of TRAF2 or JNK1α2 and
[L]t is the total concentrations of GSTP1-1 (monomers).

Western blot analysis
The cell pellet obtained at each time point was lysed
as previously reported [17] and the protein concentration
was determined using the Lowry colorimetric assay.
Proteins (40 μg) were loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (GE
Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). Anti-P-JNK (Thr183
Tyr185) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-JNK
(Cell Signaling) and anti-β actin were used as primary
antibodies. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Cell Signaling) were revealed with the ECL LiteAblot
Extend (EuroClone). The ImageJ software was used to
analyze the band intensities.

Cell culture and cell treatments
The following human melanoma cell lines were
used throughout the study: A375, MALME-3M (American
Type Culture Collection, ATCC; Manassas, VA); G-361,
IST-MEL-1 (Interlab Cell Line Collection, ICLC, Genova,
Italy); SK23-MEL cells were originally provided by Dr. T.
Boon (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Belgium).
All cell lines were profiled using DNA
fingerprinting technology (AmpFlSTR Identifiler Plus
PCR Amplification kit, Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The Short Tandem Repeat
(STR) profiles of the analyzed cell lines were compared
to DNA fingerprinting databases (i.e., ATCC, DMSZ). All
the profiles analyzed showed a similarity higher than 80%.
A375 and SK23-MEL cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s MEM (EuroClone, Milan, Italy). IST-MEL-1

Cytofluorimetric analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed at different times
after treatment with equitoxic concentrations of MC3181.
A375 and SK23-MEL cells, were fixed with 70% ethanol
overnight, stained with PI staining buffer (50 mg/ml PI,
10 mg/ml RNAsi and 1% Triton X-100) and analyzed
by a FACSCalibur (BD Bioscence, San Jose, CA, USA).
The percentage of early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and
necrotic cells was determined by simultaneous staining of

cells with PI (2 μg/ml) and Annexin V-FITC (0.5 μg/ml)
(Sigma Aldrich), according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Flow cytometric data were analyzed by the FlowJo 8.8.6
software (Tree Stare, Inc, Ashland, OR, USA).

and organs collected for tissue injury assessment by
H&E staining. Briefly, organs (intestine, liver, kidneys,
spleen, heart, and lungs) were formalin-fixed (PFA
1%, Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) for 2 hrs and then
transferred in PBS 20% sucrose (Sigma, Milan, Italy)
for the H&E staining.
Toxicity was also evaluated in tumor-bearing mice
on the basis of macroscopic autopsy findings, mainly in
terms of alteration to the size and color of vital organs, and
net BW reduction. The percentage of net BW variation,
between the first day of treatment and sacrifice day (or
day of interest), was evaluated according to the following
equation:

Assessment of caspase-3 activity
Apoptosis was confirmed by measuring caspase-3
activity, at 25°C, in total cell lysates, using the model
fluorescent peptide substrate N-Acetyl-Asp-Glu-ValAsp-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVDAFC). Proteolytic cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AFC resulted
in a fluorescence emission at 505 nm (excitation at
400 nm) [17]. Caspase activity was expressed as change in
fluorescence per min, per 106 cells.

Determination of SK23-MEL melanin content
and tyrosinase activity

In vivo human melanoma models and treatment
All in vivo experiments were performed using
6- to 8-wk-old male or female immunodeficient mice
of different strains purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Calco) and housed in specific pathogen-free
animal facilities.
With regard to the in vivo fragment tumor model,
A375 cells were injected (1x107) subcutaneously (s.c.) into
the right flank of an athymic Nude-Foxn1nu female mouse,
and the established primary tumor was then removed and
cut into fragments (2–3 mm diameter) and implanted s.c.
into recipient mice. Animals were randomly divided in
groups of 7 mice and treatment was initiated when a tumor
volume of 0.12 ± 0.01 cm3 (mean ± SEM) was reached.
SK23-MEL and G-361 cells were injected s.c. (in
both cases, 1x106) into the right flank of NOD/SCID and
SCID male mice, respectively. Animals were randomly
divided in groups of 6 mice and treatments were started at
day 10 (SK23-MEL) and 14 (G-361), when tumors were
clearly palpable.
MC3181, dissolved in PBS, was administered i.v.
or orally q1dx5 for three weeks at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day.
The reference drug temozolomide, dissolved in
DMSO/PBS 1:1 to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, was
administered i.p. q1dx5 at a dose of 100mg/kg/day.
Control groups consisted of PBS-administered mice.

Melanin content and tyrosinase activity of SK23MEL cells were determined after 48 hrs incubation with
MC3181 (7 μM). Cells (1x106) were lysed in 1M NaOH
at 100°C, for 1 hour and then centrifuged at 15,000 g,
for 20 minutes. The melanin content of the resulting
supernatant was evaluated spectrophotometrically
at 490 nm, to avoid interference from MC3181.
Tyrosinase activity was examined by measuring
spectrophotometrically at 475 nm the rate of L-DOPA
oxidation to dopachrome over 1 hour at 37°C. Cells
[1x106 in 40 μl of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM PMSF]
were disrupted by freezing and thawing and centrifuged
at 15,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The assay was started
by addition of 100 μl of 2 mg/ml L-DOPA to 40 μl of
supernatant. Tyrosinase activity was expressed as
change in absorbance, per hour, per 106 cells.

In vivo explorative toxicology studies in mice
Procedures involving animals and their care were in
conformity with institutional guidelines that comply with
national and international laws and policies (D.L. 116/92
and subsequent implementing circulars), and experimental
protocols were approved by the local Ethical Committee
of Padua University (CEASA).
Multiple-dose toxicology studies were carried
out in seven-week-old female CD-1 mice (Charles
River, Calco, Italy). Animals were randomly assigned
to each experimental group (n = 3/group) and were
treated orally or intravenously with MC3181 (8 mg/kg
dissolved in PBS), or PBS only (control group) for 5
consecutive days (q1dx5) followed by a 2-day washout. After 3 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed

Evaluation of antitumor efficacy in vivo
Primary tumor growth was determined for all animals
by caliper measurement (minor and major axis length), three
times per week, until they were sacrificed. Primary tumor
volume was determined using the following equation:

where α and β are the minor and major axes,
respectively.
The efficacy of the treatment was also analyzed
by calculation of the percentage of Increase in Life Span
(% ILS), since this analysis gives an evidence of clinical
potency [34]. Survival endpoint for each animal was fixed
at the day when tumor volume reached 1.0 cm3 (A375) or
0.4 cm3 (SK23-MEL and G-361), and data were used to
plot the relative Kaplan-Meier curves. Treatment efficacy
was then evaluated by comparing the Median Survival

At sacrifice, tumors were removed, formalin-fixed
and paraffin embedded. All internal organs were fixed and
paraffin embedded for the morphological study to evaluate
drug effects in normal tissues. Three μm-thick sections
were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
[35]. Two observers blindly classified the tissues for
necrotic areas, evaluated as percent of total area, mitosis
number in 10 high power field randomly selected away
from the ischemic necrosis.
Tissue-xenografts treated with 8 mg/kg of MC3181
were studied by immonohistochemistry to identify the
activation of JNK (after 6 hrs) and apoptosis, characterized
by immune-staining for Caspase3 (at the end of treatment).
Briefly, 3-μm-thick sections were pre-treated with EDTA
citrate pH 7.8, for 30 min, at 95°C and then incubated
respectively with rabbit monoclonal anti-PhosphoSAPK/JNK (1:100, 81E11, Cell Signaling, Danvers
Massachusetts, USA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Caspase3,
for 60 min (1:100, PA5-16335, ThermoFisher Scientific,

All the in vitro experiments were repeated at
least three times; results are presented as means ± SD.
Statistical evaluation was done using the Student’s t- test
(two tailed).
Tumor volumes in in vivo studies (presented as
means ± SEM) were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test for
multiple comparisons. Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method was performed to estimate the survival curves, and
comparison of survivals between groups was performed
