ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis, one of the major routes for tumor invasion and metastasis
represents a rational target for therapeutic intervention. Recent development in
drug discovery has highlighted the diverse biological and pharmacological properties
of hydroxamate derivatives. In this study, we characterized the anti-angiogenic
activities of a novel aliphatic hydroxamate, WMJ-S-001, in an effort to develop
novel angiogenesis inhibitors. WMJ-S-001 inhibited vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-A-induced proliferation, invasion and endothelial tube formation of
human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). WMJ-S-001 suppressed VEGF-A-induced
microvessel sprouting from aortic rings, and attenuated angiogenesis in in vivo
mouse xenograft models. In addition, WMJ-S-001 inhibited the phosphorylations of
VEGFR2, Src, FAK, Akt and ERK in VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs. WMJ-S-001 caused
an increase in SHP-1 phosphatase activity, whereas NSC-87877, a SHP-1 inhibitor,
restored WMJ-S-001 suppression of VEGFR2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation.
Furthermore, WMJ-S-001 inhibited cell cycle progression and induced cell apoptosis
in HUVECs. These results are associated with p53 phosphorylation and acetylation
and the modulation of p21 and survivin. Taken together, WMJ-S-001 was shown to
modulate vascular endothelial cell remodeling through inhibiting VEGFR2 signaling
and induction of apoptosis. These results also support the role of WMJ-S-001 as a
potential drug candidate and warrant the clinical development in the treatment of
cancer.

poor outcome. Modulating tumor-associated angiogenesis
thus represents a promising strategy for the development
of anti-cancer therapies [3, 4]. Angiogenesis is regulated
by the balance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic
signaling. Although oncogenic events may enhance tumor
cell survival during the initial avascular phase, subsequent
large-scale tumor growth requires blood supply. The
balance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic signaling
therefore shifts towards blood vessel formation to ensure
adequate blood supply for tumor cell growth [5]. This
“angiogenic switch” initiates angiogenesis which requires
integrated actions of a number of angiogenic factors
[6]. Numerous angiogenic factors including vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [7], epidermal growth
factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [8,
9] and angiopoietin [10] have been implicated in tumor
angiogenesis. Of these, VEGF-A, a member of the VEGF
family, plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis [11, 12].
VEGF-A is over-expressed in a variety of tumors [13],and
augments most steps of angiogenesis such as increasing
vascular permeability and endothelial cell proliferation,
migration and invasion into the surrounding tissue [14].
Cellular responses to VEGF-A are mainly mediated by
the receptor tyrosine kinase VEGFR2 (also known as Flk1) on the surface of endothelial cells [15]. Activation of
VEGFR2 turns on the signaling cascades including Src
family kinases, Akt (also known as protein kinase B), focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) [16]. These signaling cascades are involved
in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, migration
and survival [17-19]. In addition, VEGFR2 associates with
SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1
(SHP-1) [20], the silencing of which accelerates
angiogenesis in a rat model [21]. It suggests that tyrosine
phosphatase-mediated inactivation may provide another
means of regulating VEGFR2 signaling. Thus VEGFVEGFR2 signaling represents an attractive target for antiangiogenesis therapy of cancer [22]. Various strategies to
interfere with VEGF-A-VEGFR signaling are currently
being assessed in clinical trials. These include soluble
receptors that sequester VEGF-A [23], antibodies targeting
VEGF-A or VEGFR [24], and small molecule inhibitors
of VEGFR2 [25]. To date, monoclonal antibody such as
bevacizumab [26] and small molecule inhibitors such as
sorafenib and sunitinib have already been approved by the
United States Food and Drug Administration for treating
certain tumor types [27].
Recent development in drug discovery has
highlighted the diverse biological and pharmacological
properties of hydroxamate, a key pharmacophore [28].
A variety of hydroxamate derivatives have demonstrated
their potential use as anti-inflammatory [29], antiinfectious [30], or anti-tumor [31, 32] agents. They have
also been shown to exhibit anti-angiogenic properties
[33], but the mechanisms for this effect remain unclear
at this time. Given their potential as lead compound
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for drug discovery, we synthesized a series of aliphatic
hydroxamate derivatives, the WMJ-S compounds, and
evaluated their anti-angiogenic properties. We also
examined SHP-1’s role in WMJ-S compounds’ antiangiogenic actions.
WMJ-S-001 (Fig. 1A) was selected among this
group of compounds displaying potent inhibitory activities
in VEGF-A-stimulated human umbilical endothelial cells
(HUVECs). In this study, WMJ-S-001 activated SHP-1 to
suppress VEGFR2 signaling and subsequent angiogenesis
in VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs. WMJ-S-001 also
activated p53 signaling, leading to HUVEC apoptosis.
Similarly, WMJ-S-001 suppressed angiogenesis in
VEGF-A- and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells-induced
angiogenesis xenograft model. Taken together, these
results suggest the potential of WMJ-S-001 as a
therapeutic agent with activity against tumor angiogenesis.

RESULTS
WMJ-S-001 inhibits VEGF-A-induced cell
proliferation, migration and tube formation of
HUVECs
Angiogenesis is a complex process that involves
several discrete steps including endothelial cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation [34].
To investigate whether aliphatic hydroxamate derivatives,
the WMJ-S compounds (Fig.1A), exhibit anti-angiogenic
activities, BrdU labeling analysis was employed to
determine the effects of WMJ-S-001, WMJ-S-002 and
WMJ-S-003 on cell proliferation in VEGF-A-stimulated
HUVECs. Cells were starved with 2 % FBS-containing
medium for 16 h, and then stimulated by VEGF-A (20 ng/
ml) in the presence or absence of the WMJ-S compounds
(1-30 μM) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, the percentage
of BrdU-labeled cells significantly increased after a 24 h
VEGF-A treatment as compared with the vehicle-treated
group, but this increase was reversed by WMJ-S-001,
WMJ-S-002 or WMJ-S-003 in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 1B). Because WMJ-S-001 exhibited the most
marked inhibitory effects, we sought to further investigate
its inhibitory mechanisms in VEGF-A-stimulated
HUVECs. We next used transwell invasion assay to
determine the effect of WMJ-S-001 on HUVEC invasion,
a pivotal step in angiogenesis [35]. As shown in Fig.
1C, using VEGF-A as the chemoattractant, WMJ-S-001
significantly reduced the number of invaded cells through
the gelatin-coated transwell membrane barrier (Fig. 1C).
Tubular formation of endothelial cells is also a key step
in angiogenesis. To assess WMJ-S-001’s effect on this
step, HUVECs seeded on the surface of Matrigel in the
presence of VEGF-A were treated with either WMJ-S-001
or vehicle as control. As shown in Fig. 1D, cells treated

with VEGF-A became elongated, and formed capillarylike structure within 16 h. However, the addition of
WMJ-S-001 concentration-dependently suppressed the
formation of capillary-like network (Fig. 1D). These

results indicate that WMJ-S-001 exerts anti-angiogenic
activity through inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion
and tube formation of endothelial cells.

WMJ-S-001
suppresses
VEGF-A-induced
microvessel sprouting ex vivo, and tumor cellsinduced angiogenesis in vivo

to the vehicle-treated control group. To further investigate
whether WMJ-S-001 inhibits tumor angiogenesis, we
used an anti-CD31 antibody to stain sections of the solid
tumors. As shown in Fig. 2E, the tumor blood vessels in
WMJ-S-001-treated tumors were clearly fewer than in
the sections from the vehicle-treated control group. These
results indicate that WMJ-S-001 inhibits tumor growth
through, at least in part, suppressing tumor angiogenesis.
In addition, no significant differences in body weights
were found among the vehicle- and WMJ-S-001-treated
groups throughout the whole experiment (Fig. 2F).

We next explored the effects of WMJ-S-001 on
VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis using an ex vivo rat aortic
ring microvessel sprouting assay. As shown in Fig. 2A,
VEGF-A triggered microvessel sprouting, leading to the
formation of a complex network of microvessels around
the aortic rings. Treatment with WMJ-S-001 markedly
inhibited this phenomenon (Fig. 2A). We used VEGFA-induced angiogenesis Matrigel plug assay to study
the anti-angiogenic effects of WMJ-S-001 in vivo. As
shown in Fig. 2B, significant blood vessel formation
was observed in VEGF-A-supplemented Matrigel plug.
The pale color of the plugs removed from the mice
treated with WMJ-S-001 (20 mg/kg/day) indicates that
VEGF-A induced less neovascularization after 10-day
treatment with WMJ-S-001 (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The
level of angiogenesis was quantified by determining the
hemoglobin content of the plugs. A marked reduction in
neovascularization was shown in plugs from WMJ-S-001treated mice when compared with those from vehicletreated mice (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). We also used a tumor
cell-induced angiogenesis model to investigate WMJ-S001’s anti-angiogenic effects. HCT116 colorectal cancer
cells were mixed with Matrigel and injected into the flanks
of mice. Matrigel plugs were harvested 10 days after
implantation. As shown in Fig. 2C, HCT116 cells induced
blood vessel formation in the plug (Fig. 2C, upper panel).
In contrast, the pale color of the plugs removed from the
mice treated with WMJ-S-001 (20 mg/kg/day) indicates
that HCT116 cells’ angiogenic effect was mitigated
(Fig. 2C, upper panel). We also quantified the level of
angiogenesis by determining the hemoglobin content of
the plugs. A marked reduction in neovascularization was
shown in plugs from WMJ-S-001-treated mice when
compared with those from vehicle-treated control mice
(Fig. 2C, bottom panel). These data indicate that systemic
administration with WMJ-S-001 significantly suppressed
angiogenesis in this in vivo assay.

WMJ-S-001 suppresses VEGF-A-induced Src,
FAK, Akt and ERK phosphorylation
VEGF-A signaling via VEGFR2 is the most
important pathway in inducing angiogenesis [36]. There
are several tyrosine residues on VEGFR2 that become
phosphorylated upon VEGF-A exposure. Among these,
tyrosine residues 1175 and 1214 are the two major VEGFA-dependent autophosphorylation sites of VEGFR2 [37].
We therefore sought to determine whether WMJ-S-001
affects VEGFR2 Tyr1175 and Tyr 1214 phosphorylation
in HUVECs after VEGF-A exposure. We also examined
the phosphorylation status of Src, FAK, Akt and ERK,
which are the essential protein kinases downstream of
VEGFR2 signaling. As shown in Fig. 3A, WMJ-S-001
inhibited VEGFR2 Tyr1175 and Tyr 1214 phosphorylation
in VEGF-stimulated HUVECs (Fig. 3A). WMJ-S-001 also
suppressed the phosphorylation of Src (Fig. 3B), FAK
(Fig. 3C), Akt (Fig. 3D) and ERK (Fig. 3E) in VEGFstimulated HUVECs. Together, these results suggest
that WMJ-S-001 exerts its anti-angiogenic activities by
inhibiting VEGFR2 signaling.

SHP-1 contributes to WMJ-S-001’s inhibitory
actions in VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs
We next explored the mechanism by
which WMJ-S-001 suppresses VEGF-A-induced
VEGFR2 phosphorylation. It is conceivable that
WMJ-S-001 activates a protein tyrosine phosphatase
that dephosphorylates and inactivates VEGFR2
signaling. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that
phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is negatively regulated
by SHP-1 [20, 21, 38]. In addition, knockdown of
SHP-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promotes
VEGF-A-induced cell proliferation in HUVECs and
accelerates angiogenesis in a rat model [21, 38]. Thus,
we investigated whether SHP-1 is involved in WMJ-S001-induced VEGFR2 dephosphorylation in VEGF-Astimulated HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 4A, NSC-87877, a
SHP-1 inhibitor restored VEGFR2 Tyr1175 and Tyr1214
phosphorylation in VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs despite
the presence of WMJ-S-001. We next determined whether

WMJ-S-001 suppressed colorectal tumor growth
in a mouse xenograft model
We also used a mouse xenograft colorectal tumor
model to investigate the effects of WMJ-S-001 on tumor
growth. HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were injected
into the flanks of mice. After allowing the tumors to grow
subcutaneously to an average size of about 150 mm3,
animals were treated with either vehicle or WMJ-S-001
(20 mg/kg/day) by daily intraperitoneal injections (I.P.)
for 22 days. At the end of 22 days, mice were sacrificed
and tissue samples were collected. As shown in Fig. 2D,
WMJ-S-001 markedly reduced tumor growth comparing

in Matrigel and treated with VEGF-A (20 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of WMJ-S-001 at indicated concentrations. The effect of
WMJ-S-001 on formation of vessel sprout from various aorta samples was examined on day 8. Bar graphs show compiled data of average

WMJ-S-001’s suppression of cell proliferation is altered
by NSC-87877 in HUVECs exposed to VEGF-A. As
shown in Fig. 4B, NSC-87877 significantly restored WMJS-001-decreased cell proliferation in VEGF-A-stimulated
HUVECs. WMJ-S-001’s suppression of VEGF-A-induced
tube formation was also mitigated by NSC-87877 in

HUVECs (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, WMJ-S-001 caused
an increase in SHP-1 phosphatase activity in a timedependent manner (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that
SHP-1 is responsible for WMJ-S-001-decreased VEGFR2
phosphorylation and subsequent angiogenesis in HUVECs
exposed to VEGF-A.

determine if the actions of WMJ-S-001 in decreasing
HUVEC viability were attributable to its cytotoxic effect
As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment of cells with WMJ-S-001
at 1 to 10 µM for 24 h did not significantly increase LDH
release. However, WMJ-S-001 at concentrations higher
than 10 μM (20 and 30 μM) significantly increased LDH

with propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V-FITC labeling

to detect apoptosis in HUVECs exposed to WMJ-S-001.
As shown in Fig. 5C, WMJ-S-001 at 30 µM significantly
increased the percentage of the annexin V+PI- cells (lower
right quadrant, early apoptotic cells) and the annexin V+PI+
cells (upper right quadrant, advanced apoptotic cells and/
or necrotic cells), but concentrations below 10 µM had
little effects. We also used flow-cytometric analysis with
PI labeling to determine whether WMJ-S-001 affects cell
cycle progression and induces apoptosis. As shown in Fig.
5D, the percentage of PI-stained cells in the S region was
significantly decreased after 24 h treatment of WMJ-S-001
compared with the vehicle-treated group. These effects
were accompanied by the increase in the percentage
of PI-stained cells in the G1 region after exposure to
WMJ-S-001 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μM
(Fig. 5D). In addition, WMJ-S-001 at concentrations at
10 μM or lower did not significantly induce cell apoptosis
while WMJ-S-001 at concentrations higher than 10 μM
(20 and 30 μM) significantly increased the percentage of
PI-stained cells in the sub-G1 region (apoptotic region)
(Fig. 5D). We next determined whether WMJ-S-001
activates caspase 3, which has been documented as an
apoptotic marker. A selective caspase 3 substrate, PARP,
was also used to confirm whether WMJ-S-001-activated
caspase 3 results in PARP cleavage. As shown in Fig. 5E,
WMJ-S-001 at 20 and 30 μM markedly increased cleaved
form (active form) of caspase 3. These effects were
accompanied by the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 5E). These
results suggest that suppression of cell proliferation and
induction of apoptosis may also contribute to the antiangiogenic actions of WMJ-S-001.

Previous studies demonstrated that p53 transactivate
p21cip/Waf1 to inhibit cell proliferation [42]. Meanwhile,
an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family member survivin
plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression

WMJ-S-001 induces p53 phosphorylation and
acetylation in HUVECs
Transcription factor p53 modulates the expression
of target genes resulting in diverse cellular responses
including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [39, 40]. This
transcription factor is activated via phosphorylation and
acetylation [39, 41]. As shown in Fig. 6A, WMJ-S-001
at concentrations ranging from 3 to 30 μM significantly
induced p53 phosphorylation and acetylation in HUVECs.

Cells were treated with vehicle or WMJ-S-001 at indicated

status of p53 was then determined by immunoblotting. Complied

and apoptosis [43, 44]. We previously demonstrated that
p53 negatively regulates survivin expression [6]. Recent
study showed that survivin level was elevated during
angiogenesis [45]. Therefore, we examined whether
WMJ-S-001 affects the levels of p21cip/Waf1 and survivin in
HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 6B, WMJ-S-001 at 1-10 μM
increased p21cip/Waf1 expression. In contrast, WMJ-S-001 at
20 and 30 μM decreased the level of p21cip/Waf1 in HUVECs
(Fig. 6B). The results also demonstrated that treatment
of WMJ-S-001 concentration-dependently suppressed
survivin expression (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that
WMJ-S-001 affects HUVEC proliferation and apoptosis
through p53 activation and alterations in the protein levels
of p21cip/Waf1and survivin.

using VEGF-A- and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells
as stimuli, respectively. In summary, the inhibition of
VEGFR2 and subsequent signaling cascades may be
responsible for WMJ-S-001’s anti-angiogenic effects.
The mechanisms that regulate VEGFR2
phosphorylation remain incompletely understood. There
are many protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that
regulate growth factor effects in endothelial cells [52].
Among these PTPs, SHP-1 has been reported to negatively
regulate VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Sugano et al [21]
also demonstrated that knockdown of SHP-1 by siRNA
accelerates angiogenesis in a rat model. Consistent with
those observations, we noted that WMJ-S-001-inhibited
cell proliferation and tube formation were causally related
to SHP-1 activation. We also noted that SHP-1 inhibitor
reversed WMJ-S-001’s dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 in
VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs. These findings suggest that
SHP-1 plays a pivotal role in VEGFR2 dephosphorylation
and subsequent signaling events in the presence of
WMJ-S-001. Moreover, VEGFR2 phosphorylation is
reported to be regulated by density enhanced phosphatase
(DEP)-1, VE-PTP and PTP1B. DEP-1 [53] or VE-PTP
[54] deletion leads to increased VEGFR2 phosphorylation,
and consequent activation of downstream signaling
cascades. PTP1B was shown to negatively regulate
VEGF-A signaling by dephosphorylating VEGFR2
[55]. It raises the possibility that PTPs other than SHP-1
contribute to WMJ-S-001 dephosphorylation of VEGFR2.
Further investigations are needed to characterize whether
other PTPs such as DEP-1, VE-PTP, or PTP1B contribute
to the anti-angiogenic actions of WMJ-S-001.
We also demonstrated that WMJ-S-001 induces the
activation of p53 and its downstream target, p21, the cell
cycle regulator. The elevated levels of p21 by WMJ-S-001
provide a barrier to proliferation by blocking cell cycle
machinery. It appears additional cycle regulatory proteins
contribute to the anti-proliferative actions of WMJ-S-001.
While WMJ-S-001 at a concentration of ≤ 10 μM inhibited
cell cycle progression, it is capable of inducing caspase
3 activation and cell apoptosis at a concentration of >10
μM. Similar to the previous report that caspase 3-mediated
cleavage of p21 convers cells from growth arrest to
undergo apoptosis [56], we also noted that WMJ-S-001activated caspase 3 is accompanied by a decrease in p21
level. On the other hand, it is reported that survivin level
was found elevated during angiogenesis [45]. Survivin
plays a critical role in regulating not only apoptosis, but
also mitosis [57]. We have previously shown that p53
negatively regulated survivin expression [39]. Therefore,
p53-mediated down-regulation of survivin may also
contribute to the anti-proliferative, apoptotic and antiangiogenic actions of WMJ-S-001 in HUVECs. The
molecular mechanism underlying WMJ-S-001 activation
of p53 has not been delineated. We recently found that
SHP-1 inhibitor NSC-87877 restored the WMJ-S001’s effects on p21 and survivin levels in HUVECs

DISCUSSION
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death
worldwide with increasing incidence. Angiogenesis
plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis
[46, 47]. The inhibition of angiogenesis thus represents a
potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Several
angiogenesis inhibitors have already shown benefit in
suppressing tumor growth and metastasis in various types
of solid tumors [2, 48]. These findings led to increased
efforts to discover and develop novel angiogenesis
inhibitors. There is growing evidence of the beneficial
effects of hydroxamate derivatives in the treatment of
cancer [28, 31, 32]. In this study, we have identified an
aliphatic hydroxamate derivative, WMJ-S-001, which
suppressed both VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis ex vivo
and tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo. We demonstrated
that WMJ-S-001 activates SHP-1 to inhibit VEGFR2
signaling and subsequent angiogenesis. p53 signaling and
alterations of p21 and survivin levels may also contribute
to the anti-angiogenic effects of WMJ-S-001. Our results
also showed that suppressing angiogenesis may contribute
to WMJ-S-001 reduction of tumor growth in a tumor
xenograft model.
VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling plays a pivotal role
in angiogenesis. It appears that suppression of VEGFR2
signaling is a promising anti-angiogenic strategy for
cancer treatment [49, 50]. Phosphorylation of VEGFR2
residues is required for the activation of its downstream
signaling pathways including Src, Akt, ERK and FAK,
which regulate endothelial cell survival, proliferation and
motility [16, 25]. There are several VEGFR2 tyrosine
residues that become phosphorylated after VEGF-A
exposure. Among these residues, Tyr1175 is believed to
be the most important in angiogenic signaling in VEGFA-stimulated HUVECs [51]. Our results demonstrated
that WMJ-S-001 inhibited the phosphorylation of not only
VEGFR2 Tyr1175, but also Tyr1214 and in downstream
kinases such as Src, Akt, ERK and FAK in HUVECs
exposed to VEGF-A. Ultimately, WMJ-S-001 attenuated
angiogenesis in both ex vivo and in vivo animal models

(unpublished data). Chen et al [58] further demonstrated
that activation of SHP-1-PP2A-p38MAPK cascade
induces p53 phosphorylation and activation in vascular
smooth muscle cells. Taken together, these findings
suggest that SHP-1 mediates WMJ-S-001-induced p53
activation and alterations of p21 and survivin. However,
further investigations are needed to clarify the causal role
of SHP-1 and the underlying mechanisms of WMJ-S-001induced p53 activation in HUVECs.
In addition to targeting VEGFR2 signaling,
apoptotic mechanisms may also contribute to WMJ-S001’s anti-angiogenic effects when its concentration is
higher than 10 μM. Moreover, we recently noted that
WMJ-S-001 not only suppresses angiogenesis, but
also inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in
HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (unpublished data). It
suggests that anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of
WMJ-S-001 on tumor cells may also contribute to its
anti-tumor actions. The different mechanisms of WMJS-001’s actions in suppressing angiogenesis and tumor
cell proliferation remain to be elucidated. It is likely
that targeting angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation
culminates in the suppression of tumor growth.
In summary, we have demonstrated in this study
that WMJ-S-001 exhibits anti-angiogenic effects through
at least two signaling pathways: SHP-1-mediated
suppression of VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling and p53mediated alterations of p21 and survivin in HUVECs.
These results support the potential of WMJ-S-001 as
a valuable lead compound in the development of antiangiogenic agent in future oncologic therapy.

then filtered on a nylon mesh filter. The samples were
analyzed using the FACScan and Cellquest program (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA. USA). The ModFit programs
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were used to determine
the percentage of PI-stained cells in the subG1 (Apoptosis,
Apo), G0/G1, S or G2/M region. On the other hand,
apoptotic cells were also detected by propidium iodide (PI)
and annexin V-FITC labeling as described previously [60].
The double labeling was performed at 37 °C by treating
cells with PI (50 µg/ml) and annexin V-FITC (2 µg/ml)
for 15 min in the dark. The staining was then immediately
analyzed using the FACScan and Cellquest program. The
FCS Express program (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
was used to determine the percentage of stained cells in
different quadrants. The lower left quadrant of each panel
(annexin V-PI-) shows the viable cells, which exclude PI
and are negative for annexin V binding. The lower right
quadrant (annexin V+PI-) represents the early apoptotic
cells, annexin V positive and PI negative, demonstrating
cytoplasmic membrane integrity. The upper right quadrant
(annexin V+PI+) contains advanced apoptotic cells and
necrotic cells, which are positive for annexin V binding
and for PI uptake.

Cell culture
Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVECs) and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line were
obtained from the Bioresource Collection and Research
Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). HUVECs were maintained
in M199 medium containing vascular endothelial cell
growth supplement (ECGS) (Millipore), 10% FBS, 5 U/
ml heparin, 20 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml of penicillin G, and
100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator.
HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy5A containing
10% FBS, 100 U/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator.

Cell viability assay (MTT assay)
Cell viability was measured by the colorimetric
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay as described previously [39].

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay

Transwell invasion assay

LDH leakage was measured to quantify cytotoxicity
with a CytoTox96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit
(Promega) as described previously [59].

Transwell invasion assay was done as described
previously [59]. Briefly, the bottom face of the filter in the
transwell plate (Corning, NY, USA) was coated with 0.2
% gelatin. The bottom chambers were filled with M199
medium containing 2 % FBS in the presence of VEGF -A
(20 ng/ml) and HUVECs (104 cells per well) in 200 µL
M199 medium (without growth factors) were seeded in
the top chambers. The top chamber contained vehicle or
various concentrations of WMJ-S-001. Cells were allowed
to invade for 16 h. Non-invaded cells (on the top side
of filter) were scraped with a cotton swab, and invaded
cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue in
4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were photographed and
quantified by counting the number of stained cells under
an inverted contrast phase microscope (Nikon, Japan).

Cell proliferation assay (BrdU incorporation
assay)
HUVECs (2×104 per well) were seeded in 96-well
tissue culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were
then starved in M199 medium containing 2% FBS in
the absence of endothelial cell growth supplements for
another 16 h. After starvation, cells were pre-treated for 30
min with various concentrations of WMJ-S-001, followed
by the stimulation with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for another 24
h. Cell proliferation was then determined using a Cell
Proliferation ELISA, BrdU (colorimetric) kit (Roche)
based on the colorimetric detection of the incorporation of
BrdU, following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Matrigel tube formation assay
The tube formation assay was performed as
described previously [59]. Matrigel, a basement membrane
matrix (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA),
was polymerized at 37 °C for 30 min. HUVECs suspended
in M199 medium containing 2 % FBS in the presence
or absence of VEGF-A (20 ng/ml) were seeded onto
the Matrigel. They were then treated with vehicle or
WMJ-S-001 at indicated concentrations. After 16 h, cells
were photographed using phase-contrast microscopy.

Flow cytometric analysis
HUVECs were incubated with WMJ-S-001 at
indicated concentrations for 24 h. At the end of the
experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol at 0 °C overnight.
Cells were washed with phosphate-citric acid buffer and
subsequently stained with propidium iodide (PI) staining
buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml RNase
A, and 40 μg/ml PI for 30 min in the dark. Cells were

randomized to either the vehicle-treated control group or
the treatment group, which received WMJ-S-001 20 mg/
kg/day. The treatment was administered intraperitoneally
once daily for 10 days. At the end of treatment, animals
were sacrificed, Matrigel plugs were removed and the
surrounding tissues trimmed. Hemoglobin levels of the
Matrigel plugs were evaluated with Drabkin’s reagent
kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The concentration of hemoglobin was
calculated based on a set of hemoglobin standards. All
protocols were approved by the Taipei Medical University
Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee

Immunoblot analyses were performed as described
previously [61]. Briefly, cells were lysed in an extraction
buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 140 mM NaCl, 2
mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40, 0.05 mM pepstatin
A, and 0.2 mM leupeptin. Samples of equal amounts of
protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto a NC membrane which was then incubated in a
TBST buffer containing 5% non-fat milk. Proteins were
visualized by incubating with specific primary antibodies
followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected based on
enhanced chemiluminescence per the instructions of the
manufacturer. Quantitative data were obtained using a
computing densitometer with a scientific imaging system
(Biospectrum AC System, UVP).

Mouse xenograft colorectal tumor model
3-5 week old nudenu/nu mice were obtained from
BioLasco (Taipei, Taiwan) and housed in clean specific
pathogen free (SPF) rooms. HCT116 cells were harvested
and resuspended in PBS, and 5×106 cells in a volume of
0.3 mL were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of
each mouse. Once the tumor reached approximately 150
mm3, animals were randomized into the control group and
the treatment groups, which received WMJ-S-001 20 mg/
kg/day. The treatment was administered intraperitoneally
once daily for 22 days. Tumors were measured every
day by a digital caliper. Tumor volume was calculated
using the formula V (mm3) = [ab2] × 0.52, where a is the
length and b is the width of the tumor [39]. At the end
of treatment, animals were sacrificed and tumors were
removed. All protocols were approved by the Taipei
Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Aortic ring sprouting assay
Assay was performed as described previously[59].
Aortic arch was dissected from 8 to 10-week-old SpragueDawley rats. After removing the surrounding fibro-adipose
tissues and thoroughly rinsing with M199 culture medium,
the aortas were cut into about 1 mm ring segments. The
aortic rings were immersed in Matrigel in the wells
of 48-well plate. VEGF-A (20 ng/ml) with or without
WMJ-S-001 was then added to the wells. The aortic rings
were cultured in 37 °C with 5% CO2 and the cultured
medium was changed every 3 days. Growing sprouts of
endothelial cells were observed and photographed on
day 8. The images were photographed under microscope,
and sprouting area was determined on the computerdigitized images with Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics)
software. The analysis of sprouting area was done by an
observer who was blinded to the treatment group. All
protocols were approved by the Taipei Medical University
Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee

Immunohistochemical anylysis
Multiple cryosections were obtained from HCT116
tumor xenografts. CD31+ vessel area was assessed using
rabbit anti-mouse CD31 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody (The Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA,
USA). Antibody binding was visualized using stable
diaminobenzidine. Images were obtained in four different
quadrants of each tumor section at ×40 magnification.
Measurement of vessel area of CD31-stained vessels was
done as described previously [62].

VEGF-A or Tumor cells-induced angiogenesis
Matrigel plug assay
3-5 week old nudenu/nu mice were obtained from
BioLasco (Taipei, Taiwan) and housed in clean specific
pathogen free (SPF) rooms. An aliquot (300 μl) of
Matrigel containing VEGF (200 ng/ml) with heparin (20
U) was injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each
mouse (VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis model). In the
other set of experiments, HCT116 cells were harvested
and re-suspended in PBS. Cells (5×106 cells) in a volume
of 150 μl in the presence of heparin (20 U) were mixed
with Matrigel (150 μl) and then injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of each mouse (Tumor cells-induced
angiogenesis model). After implantation, animals were

SHP-1 activity assay
A tyrosine phosphatase assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) was used to measure phosphate
release as an index of phosphatase activity according
to the manufacturer’s instructions with modifications.
Briefly, 200 μg of cellular proteins were incubated for
2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg anti-SHP1 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and 20 μl protein

A-Magnetic Beads (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA),
to immunoprecipitate SHP-1. Immune complexes were
then collected, washed three times, and incubated with
phosphoprotein, the substrate (amino acid sequence
END(pY)INASL, 100 μM), in protein phosphatase
assay buffer (20 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid
(pH 7.5), 60 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M NaCl, and
0.1 mg/ml serum albumin). Reactions were initiated by
the addition of the phosphoprotein substrate and carried
out for 20 min at 30 °C. We also prepared appropriate
phosphate standard solutions containing free phosphate for
standard curve. Reactions were terminated by the addition
of 50 μl of the Molybdate Dye solution. The absorbance at
630 nm was measured on a microplate reader. Nonspecific
hydrolysis of END(pY)INASL by lysates was assessed in
normal IgG immunoprecipitates.
