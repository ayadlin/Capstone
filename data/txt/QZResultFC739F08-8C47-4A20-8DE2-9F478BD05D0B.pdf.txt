The development of human cancer is a multistep process characterized by the accumulation
of genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive or reflect tumour progression. These changes
distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts, allowing tumours to be recognized
as foreign by the immune system1–4. However, tumours are rarely rejected spontaneously,
reflecting their ability to maintain an immunosuppressive microenvironment5. Programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also called B7-H1 or CD274), which is expressed on many cancer
and immune cells, plays an important part in blocking the ‘cancer immunity cycle’ by
binding programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B7.1 (CD80), both of which are negative regulators
of T-lymphocyte activation. Binding of PD-L1 to its receptors suppresses T-cell migration,
proliferation and secretion of cytotoxic mediators, and restricts tumour cell killing6–10. The
PD-L1–PD-1 axis protects the host from overactive T-effector cells not only in cancer but
also during microbial infections11. Blocking PD-L1 should therefore enhance anti-cancer
immunity, but little is known about predictive factors of efficacy. This study was designed to
evaluate the safety, activity and biomarkers of PD-L1 inhibition using the engineered
humanized antibody MPDL3280A. Here we show that across multiple cancer types,
responses (as evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1) were
observed in patients with tumours expressing high levels of PD-L1, especially when PD-L1
was expressed by tumour-infiltrating immune cells. Furthermore, responses were associated
with T-helper type 1 (TH1) gene expression, CTLA4 expression and the absence of
fractalkine (CX3CL1) in baseline tumour specimens. Together, these data suggest that
MPDL3280A is most effective in patients in which pre-existing immunity is suppressed by
PD-L1, and is re-invigorated on antibody treatment.

Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that anti-PD-L1 treatment of mice bearing implanted
syngeneic tumours could lead to tumour regression and the induction of protective immune
memory in the setting of rechallenge with tumour cells (Genentech, unpublished data).
However, most mouse models constitutively express PD-L1 (ref. 12), which is not consistent
with human tumours. Additionally, only a few syngeneic models (notably the MC38 colon
carcinoma model) were responsive to anti-PD-L1 as a single agent (Genentech, unpublished
data). Therefore, a detailed analysis of PD-L1 expression in human tumours and its
association with clinical benefit was required.

Author Manuscript

PD-L1 in human cancers was investigated using an anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry
(IHC) antibody optimized for staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples.
Staining of pre-treatment specimens submitted for our clinical study demonstrated
expression across a range of cancers (Fig. 1a). PD-L1 staining was observed on tumour
cells, as well as on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (Fig. 1b), with PD-L1-positive tumourinfiltrating immune cells being more common than PD-L1-positive tumour cells. PD-L1positive tumour-infiltrating immune cells included myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic
cells) and T cells; B cells were negative for PD-L1 (Fig. 1c).
We developed a high-affinity human monoclonal immunoglobulin-G1 (IgG1) antibody for
clinical use that specifically binds to PD-L1 (MPDL-3280A; binding affinity Kd
(dissociation constant) = 0.4 nM) and prevents its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1. However,
the antibody would leave intact the interaction of PD-1 with its alternative ligand PD-L2
(also called B7-DC or CD273), which is thought to have a key role in maintaining peripheral

tolerance, particularly in the lung13,14. MPDL3280A was engineered with a crystallizable
fragment (Fc) domain modification eliminating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at
clinically relevant doses, preventing depletion of activated T cells15,16 (see Methods).
Patients were treated with MPDL3280A, and pre-treatment and on-treatment tumour
specimens were characterized from available samples. A total of 277 patients with advanced
incurable cancer received MPDL-3280A intravenously every 3 weeks (q3w; Extended Data
Fig. 1a, b and Extended Data Table 1; see Methods). Mean single-dose MPDL3280A
pharmacokinetics were consistent with a typical IgG1 at doses $1 mg kg21, with a mean
terminal serum half-life of, 3 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Overall, treatment was well
tolerated up to the maximum administered dose of 20 mg kg21 q3w (Table 1).

Most adverse events (AEs) did not require medical treatment. The most common treatmentrelated AE was fatigue (Table 1), which often occurred with low-grade fever during the first
treatment cycle. Pyrexia was reported in, 21% of patients; it most commonly occurred
during cycle 1 and was uncommon during subsequent cycles (Extended Data Fig. 2a).
Additionally, an, 2-fold increase in activated proliferating CD81 T cells (CD81HLADR1Ki-671) and a trend of increased circulating interferon (IFN)-c were observed by the end
of the first cycle (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c).
Treatment-related grade 3–4 AEs were observed in 35 patients (13%) and immune-related
grade 3–4 AEs were observed in 3 patients (1%) (see Methods for further information
regarding AE grades). No cases of grades 3–5 pneumonitis were seen.

The impact of PD-L1 inhibition on metastatic lesions was evaluated per Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). In the 175 efficacyevaluable patients (with demographic and base-line characteristics similar to those in all
patients), confirmed responses (complete and partial responses) were observed in 32 of 175
(18%), 11 of 53 (21%), 11 of 43 (26%), 7 of 56 (13%) and 3 of 23 (13%) of patients with all
tumour types, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and
other tumours (including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma), respectively. Four more patients had unconfirmed responses (Table 2, Fig. 2 and
Extended Data Fig. 3a). Responses could also be rapid and durable (Fig. 2b and Extended
Data Fig. 3a), with shrinking or resolving palpable lesions detected within days in some
responders and nearly all responders (especially patients with NSCLC) continuing to
respond and staying on study. In addition, RECIST may not accurately describe the full
spectrum of responses observed because some patients who had a best response of
progressive disease per RECIST went on to develop durable tumour shrinkage or prolonged
stable disease (pseudoprogression)17. The median progression-free survival of all patients
was 18 weeks. We also performed an exploratory analysis of patients with NSCLC and
detected a potential trend of former/current smokers responding better to MPDL-3280A
versus never smokers (11 of 26 (42%) versus 1 of 10 (10%), respectively; P = 0.4229 using a
Fisher exact test; see the accompanying paper (ref. 18) for further discussion).
There appears to be an association between response and the expression of PD-L1 in pretreatment samples (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs 3 and 4). The association of response to

MPDL3280A treatment and tumour-infiltrating immune cell PD-L1 expression reached
statistical significance (NSCLC, P = 0.015 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a); all tumours,
P = 0.007 (Fig. 3b, c and Extended Data Fig. 4b)), while the association with tumour cell
PD-L1 expression did not (NSCLC, P = 0.920 (Extended Data Fig. 4c); all tumours, P =
0.079 (Extended Data Fig. 4d)). For example, 83% of patients with IHC score 3 (tumourinfiltrating immune cell) NSCLC responded to treatments with only 17% progressing,
whereas 43% of patients with IHC 2 (tumour-infiltrating immune cell) NSCLC were limited
to disease stabilization (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a; see Methods for the IHC score
definitions). Of the patients with IHC 3 (tumour cell) NSCLC, only 38% (3 of 8) responded
while 38% (3 of 8) progressed (Extended Data Fig. 4c). There was also a trend between
tumour IHC status and median progression-free survival (Fig. 3c).

Author Manuscript

When tumour samples were examined for the expression of different immune inhibitory
factors (see Methods), the expected correlation with lack of response to MPDL3280A was
not seen (Extended Data Fig. 5a, left panel). Instead there was a trend towards increased
response in PD-L1-positive patients expressing a second negative regulator (Extended Data
Fig. 5a, right panel). High PD-L2 expression did not appear to be associated with resistance
to MPDL3280A, and some patients whose pre-treatment tumour biopsies showed the highest
levels of PD-L2 expression experienced strong responses to MPDL3280A (for example,
maximum sum of the longest diameter (SLD) decreases of 57%, 41% and 49%). Finally, the
expression of CTLA4 and fractalkine in pre-treatment tumours appeared to correlate
strongly with either response (CTLA4) or progression (fractalkine) after MPDL3280A
(Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Author Manuscript

We compared results obtained for pre-treatment NSCLC tumours with those for renal cell
carcinoma and melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 6). Although the expression of PD-L1 in
MPDL3280A-responsive patients was a common feature, other aspects of the immune
microenvironment appeared different. In melanoma, pre-treatment tumours in responding
patients demonstrated elevated expression of IFN-c as well as IFN-c-inducible genes (for
example, IDO1 and CXCL9). These associations were weaker in patients with NSCLC or
renal cell carcinoma.

Author Manuscript

To characterize the immunological events associated with tumour response or progression,
serial on-treatment tumour biopsies were performed in 28 patients (Fig. 4a). After treatment,
regressing lesions displayed a dense immune infiltrate and extensive tumour cell necrosis
accompanied by the apparent sterilization of cancer cells in some cases (Extended Data Fig.
7a, b). A decrease in tumour SLD appeared to be accompanied by an increase in PD-L1
expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells and tumour cells (Fig. 4a). The increase in
PD-L1 expression with treatment correlated with changes in tumour IFN-c expression
(Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.70; Extended Data Fig. 5c). In addition, RNA isolated
from regressing lesions was analysed for the presence of transcripts of immunological
importance using a Fluidigm-based ‘immunochip’ (iChip, see Methods), and displayed
expression patterns indicative of a generalized activation of CD8 and TH1 T-cell responses
(Extended Data Fig. 7c).

In contrast, most progressing patients with on-treatment biopsies showed a lack of PD-L1
upregulation by either tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells. These growing
tumours displayed one of three patterns: (1) little or no tumour-infiltrating immune cell
infiltration (‘immunological ignorance’; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8a); (2) presence of
an intra-tumoral immune infiltrate with minimal to no expression of PD-L1 (‘non-functional
immune response’; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8b); or (3) presence of an immune
infiltrate that resided solely around the outer edge of the tumour cell mass (‘excluded
infiltrate’; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9). Chip analysis of samples from these nonresponders failed to provide evidence of activated T cells (Extended Data Figs 8b and 9). In
cases where an excluded infiltrate of CD81 T cells was observed before treatment, PD-L1
inhibition did not induce infiltration, although both proliferation and PD-L1 expression were
detected in tumour-infiltrating immune cells at the tumour margin (Fig. 4b). Non-functional
immune responses may explain why the presence of pre-treatment CD81 T cells in tumours
(as opposed to the presence of PD-L1-positive infiltrates) failed to predict responses to
MPDL3280A (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8b).
Tumours that were non-responsive to MPDL3280A also did not exhibit an upregulation of
genes associated with enhanced T-effector-cell activity in contrast to MPDL3280A–
responsive tumours. Additionally, the expression of FOXP3 neither increased nor decreased
in responding lesions, suggesting that T-regulatory cells may not have a major role in antiPD-L1-responsive tumours.

Author Manuscript

Blood-based immune biomarkers were also examined. Several changes were observed, but
these did not track significantly with response or progression following MPDL3280A
administration. Increases in IL-18, ITAC (also called CXCL11 or IP-9) and CD81HLADR1Ki-671 T cells, as well as a modest increase in IFN-c, were observed during the first
cycle of treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c), whereas the average IL-6 expression levels
exhibited a downward trend by cycle 2, day 1.
In recent years it has become clear that modulation of a patient’s immune system can be an
effective cancer therapy19–22; however, our understanding of human cancer immunology is
incomplete. Therefore, as part of our phase Ia dose escalation and expansion study with
MPDL3280A, we focused on understanding the biomarkers relating to the PD-L1– PD-1
pathway.

Author Manuscript

This MPDL3280A study did not follow the design of a traditional phase I clinical trial, but
instead enrolled large numbers of patients with defined characteristics into expansion
phases. MPDL3280A doses ranged from 0.01 to 20 mg kg21 q3w and clinical activity was
seen from 1 to 20 mg kg21. The maximum tolerated dose of MPDL3280A was not reached,
and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed (ref. 18). Because 15 mg kg21 q3w was
sufficient to maintain target drug levels (based on clinical and non-clinical information), the
equivalent fixed dose of 1,200 mg q3w is being moved forward in clinical development as
monotherapy. The accompanying report (ref. 18) additionally describes the activity of
MPDL3280A in bladder cancer.

In addition to observing clinical responses greater than the historic averages in these
refractory patient populations, our most important finding was the association of PD-L1
expression with clinical response to MPDL3280A. It was unexpected that the association of
tumour-infiltrating immune cell PD-L1 expression with treatment response appeared
stronger than that with tumour cell PD-L1 expression. This finding appears inconsistent with
a simple ‘adaptive response’ hypothesis where T-cell-derived IFN-c induces protective
expression of PD-L1 by the tumour cells12,23. While upregulation of PD-L1 by tumour cells
occurred post-treatment in responders, our results instead suggest that tumour-infiltrating
immune cells may be more sensitive to IFN-c expression and may act preferentially to
suppress pre-existing T-cell responses before therapy. These data indicate that, although
additional immune regulatory pathways may be involved, PD-L1 appears to have a dominant
role in direct T-cell immunosuppression. Furthermore, intratumoral expression of PD-L2 did
not affect the response to anti-PD-L1, and the expression of other T-cell negative regulators
also failed to correlate with poor response. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that
inhibiting these receptors might enhance responses to PD-L1 blockade, it was striking that
MPDL3280A was effective despite their presence24,25.
Higher pre-treatment expression of CTLA4 was observed to correlate with response to
MPDL3280A. These results suggest that CTLA4, although an important regulator during Tcell expansion, is also a marker of the presence of activated T cells whose functional role as
a negative regulator of intra-tumoral T cells appears to be less important than that of PD-L1
(refs 19, 22). Another correlation was that of elevated pre-treatment fractalkine expression
with disease progression. This result was unexpected because this chemokine is generally
associated with T-cell infiltration.

Author Manuscript

We also examined blood-based biomarkers. The observed rise in ITAC—an IFN-c inducible
chemokine that is chemotactic for activated T cells26 and IL-18, a pro-inflammatory
cytokine whose presence generally induces, rather than reflects, IFN-c release—suggests the
rapid expansion of a pre-existing primed immune state, perhaps even extratumorally. The
increases in activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes during this same time frame and the clinical
reports of fever during cycle 1 further support this notion27,28 and indicate that PD-L1
blockade may also contribute to an overall expansion of the T-cell compartment at the level
of antigen-presenting cells. The decrease in IL-6 may be indicative of the opposing role of
effector T cells and suppressive myeloid cells. Given that these changes do not clearly
segregate responding patients, they may reflect a systemic re-priming and expansion of both
pre-existing antitumour T-cell and non-tumour-directed T-cell populations.

Author Manuscript

In summary, this study analysed the mechanisms associated with clinical response and lack
of response to MPDL3280A, providing evidence the ‘inflamed tumour’ hypothesis12,29.
However, larger studies will be needed to study the relationship between PD-L1 expression
and patient survival. Pre-existing immunity is probably necessary for most responses, and is
further amplified during treatment. While important to further characterize the immune
profile of responders, understanding the profile of non-responders will probably provide
even more valuable information, possibly revealing the diversity of mechanisms controlling
antitumour immunity and suggesting new strategies to promote the cancer immunity cycle5.

METHODS
Study oversight
This study was sponsored by Genentech Inc., a member of the Roche Group, which
provided the study drug. The protocol and its amendments were approved by the relevant
institutional review boards or ethics committees, and all participants provided written
informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

Study design

Author Manuscript

The goal of this study was to evaluate the single-agent safety and tolerability of
MPDL3280A, a human, monoclonal, engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody administered by
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (q3w) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic
solid tumours or haematological malignancies. Treatment was continued for 16 cycles or 1
year unless a patient experienced: (1) disease progression as assessed by Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) by physical examination
and radiographic assessment, primarily computed tomography scan30 and immune-related
response criteria17; and/or (2) loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator; and/or
(3) unacceptable toxicity as assessed by the investigator. Patients were allowed to continue
to receive study treatment at the discretion of the investigator if pseudoprogression was
suspected or if there was evidence of a mixed response.

Author Manuscript

The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
MPDL3280A q3w, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate doselimiting toxicities (DLTs) of MPDL3280A when administered as a single agent and to
identify a recommended phase 2 dose of single-agent MPDL3280A. The secondary
objectives of this study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MPDL3280A when
administered as a single agent, to characterize the immunogenic potential of MPDL3280A,
and to make a preliminary assessment of the antitumour activity of MPDL3280A as a single
agent.

Author Manuscript

This phase I study followed an adaptive design to allow for tumour-specific cohorts and
biomarker (PD-L1 positive) enriched cohorts. Within each indication of the expansion
cohort, the following futility type rule was applied: if no responders (CR or PR) were
observed from the first 14 patients (who may have been selected based on the presence of
biomarkers potentially predictive of antitumour activity), enrolment would be suspended for
that indication. With the assumption of a true response rate of 20% or higher, there was at
most a 4.4% chance of not observing any response in 14 patients. Numbers were increased
to include adequate biomarker positive and negative patients per protocol.
Safety evaluations (clinical and laboratory) were performed at screening and throughout the
trial. A final evaluation occurred by 30 days after the last dose. The incidence, nature and
severity of adverse events (AEs) were graded according to National Cancer Institute

Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, http://ctep.cancer.gov/
protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (2013).
Any evaluable or measurable disease was documented at screening and reassessed at each
tumour evaluation. Tumour evaluations were performed at the ends of cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 12
and 16 or as clinically indicated. Assessments were performed during the last week of the
drug-administration cycle and before the start of treatment in the next cycle. Patients who
discontinued study treatment for reasons other than disease progression continued to have
tumour assessments every 12 weeks until the patient experienced disease progression,
initiated further systemic cancer therapy, or died.

Author Manuscript

DLTs were defined as neutropenia grade $4; febrile neutropenia grade $3; thrombocytopenia
grade $4 that lasted $48 h; any grade 3 non-haematological or non-hepatic major organ AE,
with the exception of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea, that resolved without treatment before
the next infusion; and any hepatic toxicity grade −3, except for in patients with grade 2
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and/or alkaline phosphatase
abnormality at baseline; an increase in the baseline abnormality to >10 times the upper limit
of normal was considered a DLT.
Dose escalation
Single-patient dose escalation was used for the 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 mg kg21 cohorts (a
minimum of one patient was enrolled into these cohorts). A traditional 3 1 3 dose-escalation
scheme was used for the 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg kg21 cohorts (a minimum of three patients
was enrolled into these cohorts). The DLT window was 21 days following the first dose of
MPDL3280A. Intra-patient dose escalation was not allowed. An MTD was not reached.

Author Manuscript

Cohort expansion
Five expansion cohorts were opened, including one each for patients with NSCLC, RCC and
melanoma. Two additional expansion cohorts were opened, one for patients with other
tumour types and one for patients who received mandatory serial tumour biopsies. Patients
enrolled in these cohorts received MPDL-3280A at 10, 15 or 20 mg kg21. Intra-patient dose
escalation was allowed.
Patients

Author Manuscript

As established in the study protocol, patients were eligible to participate in the study if they
were $18 years old; had a documented, incurable, or metastatic solid tumour or
haematological malignancy; had adequate haematological and end-organ function; and had
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. For patients with
solid tumours, disease had to be measurable per RECIST. Disease-specific criteria were used
for patients with haematological malignancies. Patients with known primary central nervous
system (CNS) malignancy or symptomatic CNS metastases, history or risk of autoimmune
disease, or history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection
were excluded. Also excluded were patients who received prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4,
anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies or pathway-targeting agents as well as
patients who were treated with systemic immunostimulatory agents or systemic

immunosuppressive medications within a specified period before study start. Patients with
ocular or mucosal melanoma were not excluded from this study.
Patients on this study were offered the opportunity to participate in the serial biopsy portion
of the study. Patients who agreed to participate completed a separate informed consent form
for serial biopsies.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Blood samples were obtained at various time points before and after MPDL3280A
administration for pharmacokinetic testing.
Isolation of MPDL3280A

Author Manuscript

Although the details will be described elsewhere, the anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A
was isolated by screening a human phage display library (Genentech) against a recombinant
extracellular domain (ECD)–Fc fusion of human PD-L1 (see US Patent US 8,217,149B2). A
high-affinity antibody was selected from a single phage clone (YW243.55.S70) on a human
IgG1 backbone. Affinity measurements were conducted by surface plasmon resonance
(Biacore) and binding to PD-L1-expressing human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a).
Binding of MPDL3280A was strictly dependent on the expression of human PD-L1, while
other monoclonal antibodies (for example, trastuzumab) did not bind to the same cells.

Author Manuscript

The selected antibody was also judged to compete with soluble PD-L1–ECD for binding to
PD-1 and B7.1, either by blocking PD-L1–ECD-Fc binding to PD-1-or B7.1-expressing
cells and PD-1–ECD or B7.1–ECD. The Fcdomainof MPDL3280A was engineered to
render it effector-less by introducing an Asp to Ala change at position 298 in the CH2
domain of each heavy chain, which resulted in an anti-body devoid of N-linked
oligosaccharides that was incapable of binding to human Fcc receptors (see US Patent US
8,214,149B2). In an in vitro assay for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (using
human PBLs as effectors), the engineered anti-body was unable to mediate the killing of two
cell lines transfected with human PD-L1, while efficient killing was observed using the
unmodified ‘wild-type’ antibody (Extended Data Fig. 10b).
Immunohistochemical analysis for PD-L1 and CD8

Author Manuscript

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of 4-mm thickness were stained
for PD-L1 with an anti-human PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone SP142; Ventana,
Tucson, AZ) on an automated staining platform (Benchmark; Ventana) using a concentration
of 4.3 mg ml21, with signal visualization by diaminobenzidine; sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. PD-L1 expression was evaluated on tumour cells and tumourinfiltrating immune cells. For tumour cells the proportion of PD-L1-positive cells was
estimated as the percentage of total tumour cells; tumour cells typically showed
membranous staining with avariably strong component of cytoplasmic staining. The
distribution of PD-L1-positive tumour cells within a given tumour sample was typically very
focal; in tumours growing as solid aggregates positive tumour cells were more commonly
observed at the interface between malignant cells and stroma containing tumour-infiltrating
immune cells. For tumour-infiltrating immune cells, the percentage of PD-L1-positive

tumour-infiltrating immune cells occupying the tumour was recorded; tumour-infiltrating
immune cells with clearly discernible cytoplasm, such as macrophages and dendritic cells,
showed a membranous staining pattern for PD-L1—this was more difficult to determine for
cells of small lymphoid morphology with scant amounts of cytoplasm. PD-L1-positive
tumour-infiltrating immune cells were typically seen as variably-sized aggregates towards
the periphery of the tumour mass or in stromal bands dissecting the tumour mass or as single
cells scattered in stroma or within tumour-infiltrating immune cell aggregates. Specimens
were scored as IHC 0, 1, 2, or 3 if, 1%, $1% but, 5%, $5% but, 10%, or $10% of cells per
area were PD-L1 positive, respectively. PD-L1 scores in patients with multiple specimens
were based on the highest score. Based on the complexity of our scoring algorithm, we
determined concordance between individual reads by different pathologists; in a cohort of
>200 NSCLC samples, concordance between two pathologists was >90%. CD8 (clone SP16
(Epitomics)) IHC was performed on a Discovery XT autostainer (Ventana) using CC1
antigen retrieval and OmniMap (Ventana) detection technology.
Dual-colour immunofluorescence
Sections of FFPE tumour tissues were incubated with primary antibodies for PD-L1 and
CD3 (clone SP34-2; Pharmingen), CD163 (clone 10D6; Novus Biologicals), CD11c (clone
EP1347Y; Novus Biologics), or cytokeratin (CK; clone 5D3/LP34, Abcam) at room
temperature. Detection was performed using Novocastra PowerVision Poly-HRP IHC
Detection Systems (Leica) followed by Alexa Fluor 594 Tyramide Signal Amplification
(TSA) Kit 25 or Alexa Fluor 488 TSA Kit 22 (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Slides were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with
DAPI (Life Technologies).

DNA and RNA isolation from FFPE tumour tissue
DNA and RNA isolation was performed as described previously31. Briefly, tumour FFPE
sections were macro-dissected to enrich for neoplastic tissue, and tissue was lysed using
tumour lysis buffer and Proteinase K to allow for complete digestion and release of nucleic
acids. RNA was isolated using the High Pure FFPE RNA Micro Kit (Roche Applied
Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was isolated
using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. RNA and DNA were stored at 280 °C until the analyses were
performed.
Fluidigm expression analysis

Author Manuscript

Gene-expression analysis was performed using the BioMark HD real-time PCR Platform
(Fluidigm) as described previously31. All Taqman assays in the expression panel were FAMMGB and ordered through Life Technologies either made-to-order or custom-designed,
including four reference genes: SP2, GUSB, TMEM55B and VPS33B. A geometric median
of the Ct values for the four reference genes (SP2, GUSB, TMEM55B and VPS33B) was
calculated for each sample, and expression levels were determined using the delta Ct (DCt)
method as follows: Ct (target Gene) 2 GeoMedian Ct (reference genes). Median mRNA
expression levels (as measured by immunochip (iChip)) across patients on study were used

The association between expression of IFN-c, TH1 phenotypes, CTLA4 and fractalkine with
response to MPDL3280A was identified by t-test (P < 0.05). CD27, CXCR3, CD45RO,
GZMB and CD8A are other individual genes with a P value of, 0.05 for this association.
Because these genes are all part of the TH1 phenotype, all genes with a P value of, 0.05 for
the association of expression and response to MPDL3280A are discussed here.
FACS analysis
Blood was collected in a 5-ml NaHep tube using standard venipuncture techniques and
inverted 10 times to ensure that the blood mixed with the additive. Subsequently, the blood
was analysed for CD3, CD8, HLA-DR and Ki-67 expression by FACS at the central
laboratory (LabCorp) according to the laboratory protocol.

Plasma cytokine analysis
Blood was collected in a 6-ml NaHep tube using standard venipuncture techniques and
inverted 10 times to ensure that the blood mixed with the additive. Within 30 min of
collection, blood was centrifuged in a refriger-atedcentrifuge at a minimum of 1,500 to
2,000g for 15 min. Plasma was collected and stored at 220 °C. Subsequently, plasma was
analysed for IFN-c, interleukin 6, inter-leukin 18, or ITAC measurement using enzymelinked absorbent assay or by Rules Based Medicine (Myriad RBM), according to the
manufacturers’ recommendations.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Data from all 277 patients with advanced incurable cancer who received $1 dose of
MPDL3280A intravenously every 21 days by the clinical cutoff date of 30 April 2013 were
used to determine baseline characteristics and rates of adverse events. The efficacy analysis
included 175 patients with a baseline tumour assessment who received $1 mg kg21 of
MPDL3280A by 1 October 2012. Efficacy was assessed according to RECIST30. The best
overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest
measurements taken since the treatment started). The best overall objective response rate
(confirmed except for one patient with NSCLC, one patient with RCC and two patients with

melanoma) was derived from investigator-reported assessments. Objective response rate
(ORR) was defined as the number of patients with a best overall objective response of
complete or partial response divided by the total number of patients with a baseline tumour
assessment who received $1 mg kg21 of MPDL3280A. The analysis of response by smoking
status was exploratory. The P value was determined using a Fisher exact test. Study design
considerations (in terms of sample size) were not made with regard to explicit power and
control of type I error considerations but were made to obtain preliminary safety,
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information.

An association of response with both PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell IHC and PDL1 tumour cell IHC was evaluated using a logistic regression model in the all-tumours and
NSCLC subsets. The dependent variable was defined as response (yes versus no), and IHC
categories (four levels) were included in the model as independent variables. In the case of
zero counts of responders in any of the IHC categories (such as in the IHC 1 category for
tumour cells in the all-tumours subset), the category was combined with an adjacent one into
one category in the logistic regression model. The P values to test the null hypothesis that
the odds ratios of the IHC categories are equal were obtained from the likelihood ratio test.
Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the date of first dose and the date
of first documented disease progression or death. Disease progression was determined on the
basis of investigator assessment using RECIST. Patients who were alive and did not
experience disease progression at the cutoff date of 30 April 2013 were censored at the time
of last tumour assessment. Patients with no post-baseline tumour assessment were censored
at the first dose date plus 1 day.

Author Manuscript

Summaries of all AEs, AEs related to treatment, and grade 3–4 AEs are provided from all
277 patients. AEs of special interest included conditions suggestive of an autoimmune
disorder, including, but not limited to, colitis and diabetes. Additionally, grade $3 acute
infections or events suggestive of hypersensitivity, cytokine release, systemic inflammatory
response, or infusion-reaction syndrome were considered AEs of special interest.
Pharmacodynamic changes of each marker were evaluated in the framework of linear mixedeffects models. For each marker, the model was fit to the log2-transformed data with patient
as the random effect and time points as the fixed effect. The mean changes from C1D1 and
their associated standard errors at each time point were derived from the model. P values
were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction, taking into account the multiplicity of
number of time points.

Figure 4. Biomarker status and response to MPDL3280A

Author Manuscript

a, Table summarizing the frequency of patients with an increase in PD-L1-ositive tumourinfiltrating immune cells (ICs) and tumour cells (TCs) by change in the sum of the longest
diameter (SLD) and by response to MPDL3280A in patients with paired serial biopsies.
There were 28 paired serial biopsies. Of these, 16 tumours were melanoma, 4 were renal cell
carcinoma, 4 were non-small cell lung cancer, 2 were head and neck carcinoma, and 2 were
colorectal cancer. Patients with an increase of $5% in PDL1-expressing tumour cells and
tumour-infiltrating immune cells were identified as having increased PD-L1 expression by
IHC after treatment with MPDL3280A. The patient who was unevaluable for SLD had the
responding tumour excised for biomarker analysis. This table also includes one patient with
progressive disease (PD) by RECIST version 1.1 but without post-dose SLD measures. b,
