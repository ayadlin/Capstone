BACKGROUND: Resistance to apoptosis is 1 of the key events that confer chemoresistance and is mediated
by the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins, which inhibit caspase activation. The objective of this
study was to evaluate whether the activation of an alternative, caspase-independent cell death pathway
could promote death in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. The authors report the characterization of NV128 as an inducer of cell death through a caspase-independent pathway. METHODS: Primary cultures of
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells were treated with increasing concentration of NV-128, and the concentration that caused 50% growth inhibition (GI50) was determined using a proprietary assay. Apoptotic proteins

induce significant cell death in both paclitaxel-resistant and carboplatin-resistant EOC cells with a GI50
between 1 lg/mL and 5 lg/mL. Cell death was characterized by chromatin condensation but was caspaseindependent. The activated pathway involved the down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and phosphorylated ribosomal p70 S6 kinase, and the mitochondrial translocation of beclin-1 followed by nuclear translocation of endonuclease G. CONCLUSIONS: The
authors characterized a novel compound, NV-128, which inhibits mTOR and promotes caspase-independent
cell death. The current results indicated that inhibition of mTOR may represent a relevant pathway for the
induction of cell death in cells resistant to the classic caspase-dependent apoptosis. These findings demonstrate the possibility of using therapeutic drugs, such as NV-128, which may have beneficial effects in

Caspase-independent Cell Death/Alvero et al

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United
States and is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate that approaches only
15%.1 A major challenge in the management of ovarian
cancer is the development of chemoresistance to most of
the currently available agents. Consequently, there is an
urgent need for better therapeutic options.
Although chemoresistance is multifactor, it is well
accepted that resistance to programmed cell death (PCD)
is a major contributing cause.2 PCD is an evolutionary
conserved pathway, the activation of which leads to an
energy-dependent cell suicide mechanism. In general, 2
forms of PCD have been described: 1) apoptosis or caspase-dependent cell death and 2) caspase-independent cell
death.3
Apoptosis is the better characterized pathway of the
2 types of PCD, such that the terms PCD and apoptosis
have been used interchangeably throughout the literature.
It involves the sequential activation of a group of proteases, the caspases, and can be activated either by ligation
of death receptors such as Fas and the tumor necrosis factor receptor (extrinsic pathway), or by mitochondrial
depolarization (intrinsic pathway).4,5 The Bcl-2 family of
proteins, which has both proapoptotic (Bcl-2 antagonist/
killer [Bak], Bcl-2–associated X protein [Bax], etc) and
antiapoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bclx), controls mitochondrial integrity, and the decision to engage the intrinsic
pathway depends on the ratio of the proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic members in the outer mitochondrial membrane.5 Numerous studies have demonstrated that most
chemotherapy agents induce cell death by activating the
apoptotic pathway and that resistance to apoptosis
because of high intracellular levels of antiapoptotic blockers such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is a
major cause of chemoresistance. Indeed, molecular or
drug targeting of apoptotic blockers such as XIAP results
in the reversal of chemoresistance.6-8
Caspase-independent cell death encompasses all
events that occur when cells die in the absence of caspase
activation. Autophagy is the most characterized caspaseindependent PCD pathway and, hence often is called
Type II PCD. It involves the controlled formation of
autophagosomes, a double-membrane cytoplasmic vesicle, which can fuse with lysosomes, thus leading to the
digestion of molecules within the autophagosome.9
Cancer

Autophagy is controlled by the Akt-mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and involves key proteins
such as beclin-1 and Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K).10 That pathway is activated to promote cell
survival; however, because of the inherent mechanisms
invoked, it also can lead to cell death.11
Cancer cells in general, and EOC cells in particular,
are very resistant to apoptotic cell death mainly because of
high-level expression of the apoptotic blockers XIAP and
FLICE inhibitory protein.12 Thus, we hypothesized that,
in addition to targeting specific apoptotic blockers,
another way to overcome chemoresistance is to circumvent apoptosis and exploit nonpoptotic or caspase-independent cell death pathways.
The PI3K/AkT/mTOR signaling axis plays a central
role in the regulation of multiple, critical cellular functions, including stress responses, cell growth and survival,
and metabolism. In many human tumors, including
EOC, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is deregulated by a
variety of oncogenic events. Therefore, the modulation of
this pathway may provide alternative therapies for patients
with ovarian cancer.
NV-128 is a member of the phenyl-substituted isoflavone family of compounds similar to phenoxodiol,12,13
which, in preliminary screening, were effective in reducing viability in a series of cancer cells; suggestive of potential antitumor activity. In the current study, we
investigated the molecular mechanisms by which NV-128
induces cell death. We describe in this report the activation by NV-128 of a caspase-independent cell death pathway in EOC cells. This pathway involves the inhibition of
mTOR phosphorylation, mitochondrial translocation of
the autophagy molecule beclin-1, and mitochondrial
release and nuclear localization of the nuclease endonuclease G (EndoG).

NV-128 decreased cell viability in a range of cancer cells,

objective was to determine the effect of NV-128 on a
panel of primary cultures of EOC cells isolated from either ascites or tumor tissue. This panel included cultures
that were resistant to paclitaxel and to carboplatin (Figs.

reduction in the percentage of viable cells after treatment
with NV-128, with a concentration that caused
50% growth inhibition between 5 lg/mL and 10 lg/mL
(Fig. 1C).

Original Article

To determine whether the decrease in cell viability
was because of apoptosis, we measured the activity of caspase-3/7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and determined the
status of 2 antiapoptotic molecules, XIAP and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). It is noteworthy that, in contrast to
the increase in caspase activity observed after treatment
with the known apoptotic inducer, paclitaxel, no changes
in caspase-3/7, caspase-8, or caspase-9 activities were
observed after treatment with NV-128 (Fig. 2A). In addition, no change in the status of XIAP was observed (Fig.
2B). However, a strong down-regulation of p-Akt was
observed as early as 15 minutes after NV-128 treatment
(Fig. 2C).
Next, we evaluated whether the decrease in cell viability was associated with changes in the DNA. Thus, cells
were stained with Hoecsht 33442 and propidium iodide
(PI) and were analyzed by flow cytometry. Hoechst
33442 is a DNA binding dye that stains healthy DNA
blue and fluoresces more intensely when it is bound to
condensed chromatin. PI staining, conversely, is indicative of membrane permeabilization, which usually is
observed during the process of cell death. Flow cytometry
analysis of NV-128-treated cells revealed that cell death
was accompanied by chromatin condensation. NV-128
induced a significant increase in double-positive cells, and
95% of cells were stained positively for both Hoechst and
PI after 24 hours (Fig. 2D).
Chromatin condensation in the absence of caspase
activation points to a caspase-independent pathway. To
demonstrated conclusively that NV-128-induced cell
death is caspase-independent, cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of NV-128 in the presence or
absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Inhibition of caspases had no impact on NV-128-induced cell
death (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that
NV-128-induced cell death proceeds through a caspaseindependent (but a possibly p-Akt–dependent) pathway,
culminating in chromatin condensation.

NV-128 Down-regulates the mTOR Pathway
Our next objective was to identify and characterize the
molecular pathways involved in NV-128-induced, caspase-independent cell death. Thus, EOC cells were
treated with NV-128 (10 lg/mL), and cell lysates were
used to measure the levels of a panel of phosphorylated

only phospho-protein the was down-regulated in the
panel was phosphorylated ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (pS6k), suggesting that NV-128 may affect the mTOR
pathway. NV-128 had minimal effect on the proteins
phosphorylated IjB kinase, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), or phosphorylated p38 kinase and even induced the upregulation of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein
kinase 1, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase,
pSTAT5a/b, and phosphorylated CAN-binding response
regulator CreB (Fig. 4A), which most likely represented a
compensatory response.
To confirm the effect on the mTOR pathway, we
evaluated the levels of p-S6k and phosphorylated mTOR
(p-mTOR) using Western blot analysis. Figure 4B illustrates that p-mTOR and p-S6k were down-regulated 15
minutes after NV-128 treatment (Fig. 4B).

NV-128 Induces Autophagy
Morphologically, NV-128-treated EOC cells contained
large intracellular vacuoles (Fig. 5B), which stained positively with acridine orange (data not shown), suggesting
that NV-128 induces autophagic-like cell death. Autophagy is 1 of the best characterized caspase-independent
forms of cell death, and it has been demonstrated that
autophagy is controlled in part by the Akt-mTOR

pathway.16 To determine whether the process of autophagy is involved, we evaluated the autophagic marker LC3II. Western blot analyses demonstrated a significant
increase in the level of LC3-II 8 hours after NV-128 treatment (Fig. 4C), confirming activation of the autophagic
pathway.

Autophagy Is Not Required for
NV-128-induced Cell Death
To determine whether the process of autophagy is the primary mechanism of NV-128-induced cell death, cells
were treated with NV-128 in the presence or absence of
the well characterized autophagy inhibitor, 3 methyladenine (3-MA), which inhibits the earliest step in the autophagosome formation.17 Cell viability studies using 3MA (10 lM) indicated that the compound is not able to
inhibit NV-128-induced cell death (Fig. 3). These data
suggest that, although some characteristics of autophagy
3210

were observed, it is not the primary mechanism of cell
death induced by NV-128.

NV-128 Induces Mitochondrial
Depolarization
Next, we determined whether NV-128-induced cell death
involved the mitochondria, because it contains nucleases
that may be responsible for the observed chromatin condensation. Thus, control and treated cells were stained
with JC-1 dye, a cationic fluorescent dye that stains intact
mitochondria red and stains depolarized mitochondria
green. Immunofluorescent images of control cells revealed
mostly red fluorescence representative of intact mitochondria (Fig. 5C), whereas images of NV-128-treated cells
mostly were green (Fig. 5D), suggesting that NV-128 is
able to induce mitochondrial depolarization. This spectral
shift was confirmed by flow cytometry, which demonstrated that NV-128-treated cultures had 59% and 84%

depolarized cells (more than control) at 1 hour and 4
hours, respectively (Fig. 6).

Beclin-1 Mitochondrial Translocation Is
Associated With Mitochondrial
Depolarization
Our next goal was to determine the upstream pathway responsible for NV-128-induced mitochondrial depolarization. The stability of the mitochondrial membrane is
controlled in part by the Bcl-2 family of proteins.5 The
proteins BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid) and
Bax are cytoplasmic proteins that translocate to the mitochondria to initiate depolarization. In contrast, Bcl-2 is a
resident mitochondrial protein that stabilizes the membrane. Treatment with NV-128 induces mitochondrial
translocation of Bax 2 hours after treatment but does not
induce the activation of Bid (Fig. 7A).
Because Bax translocation (normally 1 of the first
mediators of mitochondrial membrane destabilization)
occurs after the onset of NV-128-induced mitochondrial
depolarization (observed 1 hour after treatment), an alternative mechanism must be responsible for the initiation
of mitochondrial instability. Beclin-1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and it has been demonstrated that beclin-1 interacts with Bcl-2 through its BH domain.18 Analysis of

merase chain reaction analysis and of beclin-1 protein levels from whole cell lysates indicated that there were no
changes in beclin-1 message or protein expression after
NV-128 treatment (data not shown). However, analysis
of mitochondrial fractions revealed that beclin-1 translocates to the mitochondria as early as 1 hour after NV-128
treatment (Fig. 7A), which correlates with the onset of
mitochondrial depolarization.

Mitochondrial Beclin-1 Associates
With Bcl-2
Apart from its role in the initiation of autophagy, in which
it associates with Class III PI3K, it has been demonstrated
that the BH3 domain of beclin-1 is able to interact with
both Bcl-2 and Bclxl.18-20 In light of this finding, we
hypothesized that beclin-1 mitochondrial translocation
can lead to its interaction with Bcl-2 and, thus, can interfere with the ability of Bcl-2 to stabilize the mitochondria.
To demonstrate this association, we immunoprecipitated
beclin-1 from the mitochondrial fraction of untreated
cells or from cells that were treated for 1 hour with NV128. Then, the presence of Bcl-2 and Bak in the immunecomplex was determined by Western blot analysis. We
observed higher levels of Bcl-2 associated with beclin-1 after NV-128 treatment compared with a no-treatment
control (Fig. 7B), demonstrating that NV-128-induced
beclin-1 mitochondrial translocation can lead to a beclin1–Bcl-2 interaction. Conversely, Bak was not observed in
the complex, suggesting that this is a specific interaction
between beclin-1 and Bcl-2. These findings suggest that
beclin-1 may have the ability to initiate mitochondrial
depolarization by translocating to the mitochondria,
where it binds to and inactivates Bcl-2, potentially in a
manner similar to that described for the Bid-Bak or BidBax interaction.

NV-128 Induces EndoG Nuclear
Translocation
In the absence of caspase activation, our next goal was to
determine how NV-128-induced mitochondrial depolarization and chromatin condensation are linked. Mitochondrial nucleases represent a family of proteins that, once
released from the mitochondria, can translocate to the nucleus and cleave DNA. The observation that NV-128 is
able to induce mitochondrial depolarization suggests that
a mitochondrial nuclease may be responsible for the
observed chromatin condensation. Thus, we used Western blot analysis to quantify the levels of the mitochondrial nucleases, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and
EndoG, in nuclear fractions of NV-128-treated cells. An
increase in the level of nuclear EndoG, but not AIF, was
observed after NV-128 treatment (Fig. 7C), suggesting
that EndoG is released from the mitochondria, translo3212

cates to the nucleus, and cleaves DNA, resulting in chromatin condensation.

Antitumor Activity of NV-128 on
an EOC Xenograft Model
Next, we assessed the in vivo antitumor activity of NV128. We established a nude mouse EOC xenograft model
using EOC cells that had been isolated from malignant
ovarian cancer ascites. The antitumor activity of NV-128
was compared with that of carboplatin and paclitaxel as
described earlier. NV-128 induced a significant decrease
in tumor proliferation kinetics and final tumor volume in
a dose-dependent manner compared with carboplatin and
paclitaxel (Fig. 8A,B). The treated/control values were
30%, 58%, and 58% for NV-128, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, respectively.
Finally, to demonstrate that the in vivo antitumor
activity of NV-128 parallels the observed in vitro mechanisms, tumors were lysed, the level of p-S6k was determined by Western blot analysis, and paraffin-embedded
sections of mouse tumors were immunostained for
EndoG. The blots in Figure 8C reveal that tumors taken
from animals treated with NV-128 had a significant
decrease on p-S6k compared with the vehicle control. In
addition, we observed the nuclear localization of EndoG
in tumors from animals treated with NV-128, whereas
tumors from control animals only had cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 8D).

Toxicology Studies
Because NV-128 induced significant cell death in all cultures that we tested in vitro, a concern was its possible
toxic side effects. Thus, we determined whether NV-128
induced myelosuppression or affected liver and kidney
functions in the animals. A comparison of white blood
cell and erythrocyte counts, hematocrit, and hemoglobin
levels in NV-128-treated animals and control animals
revealed no significant differences (Fig. 9A). Comparison
of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase

results indicate that NV-128 does not induce myelosuppression and is not hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic.

In this report, we describe the antitumor activity of NV128, which involved the inhibition of mTOR signaling
both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we describe the
potential role of beclin-1 as a regulator of mitochondrial
membrane integrity through its interaction with Bcl-2.
Chemoresistance, because of the blockade of the apoptotic pathway, is 1 of the major limitations in the successful treatment of EOC. Indeed, cancer cells in general
are characterized by high levels of expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as XIAP, Bcl-2, and p-Akt. Although
numerous in vitro studies have reported that knockdown
of these proteins can sensitize cancer cells to apoptotic signals, the current state of gene therapy technology limits
this approach.
The description of additional forms of cell death
other than apoptosis suggests that an alternative approach
3213

to chemoresistance may be to bypass apoptosis and specifically target alternative pathways that are independent of
antiapoptotic proteins. In this study, we used a panel of
EOC cells, including paclitaxel-resistant and carboplatinresistant cell lines, and demonstrated that treatment of
these cells with NV-128 induces a caspase-independent
cell death characterized by mitochondrial depolarization
and chromatin condensation. We also demonstrated that
this pathway involves the early down-regulation of pmTOR and p-AKT. An important function of mTOR is
the control of translation through the regulation of S6k
and eukaryotic translocation initiation factor 4E-binding
protein 1. This results in enhanced translation, enhanced
cell mass, and cell cycle progression.21,22 mTOR is an
essential part of tumor progression and is capable of integrating proliferative, antiapoptotic, and angiogenic signaling by connecting VEGF, hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(HIF-1), and human epidermal growth factor receptor
family receptors.23 In addition, signaling through mTOR
is stimulated by survival pathways, including the PI3KAkt and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.24 Therefore, inhibition of mTOR activity may have
critical effects on many of these survival pathways.
EOC cells are resistant to rapamycin (our unpublished data), the classic mTOR complex I inhibitor, which
functions as a structural competitive inhibitor. Therefore,
the down-regulation of p-mTOR may represent a more
suitable target to block the prosurvival pathways activated
by mTOR more than competitive inhibition.
To understand the downstream consequences of
mTOR inhibition, we evaluated proteins associated with
autophagy and mitochondrial integrity. Although we
observed the activation of the autophagic pathway, the
induction of cell death by NV-128 was not inhibited by
the autophagy inhibitor 3MA. We also observed changes
in mitochondrial integrity, and it is noteworthy that we
observed that the levels of beclin-1, a main player in the
autophagic pathway, significantly increased in the mitochondria after NV-128 treatment. Beclin-1 is a Bcl-2–
binding protein that was identified first by using yeast 2hybrid systems.19 Its function as a proautophagic molecule has been characterized extensively. Beclin-1, as part
of a complex with Class III PI3K, is involved in autophagosome formation, which initiates the process of autophagy. Beclin-1 is deleted monoallelically in most cancers,
which is suggestive of an antitumor function.25 Indeed,
3214

reports have indicted that the overexpression of beclin-1
has proapoptotic effects. Furuya et al demonstrated that
ectopic expression of beclin-1 augments cisplatin-induced
caspase-9 activation,26 whereas Levine’s group demonstrated that beclin-1 gene transfer in breast cancer cells
results in decreased tumorigenicity.25 Because of the role
played by beclin-1 in autophagy, a process known initially
as a cell-survival mechanism, it is unclear how a molecule
involved in a survival pathway would have antitumor
activity.
Together with the description of the crystal structure
of beclin-1 and the demonstration that its BH3 domain
associates with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members,20 our
data, which demonstrate the association between beclin-1
mitochondrial translocation and mitochondrial depolarization, provide evidence of the possible prodeath function
of beclin-1, which is independent of its role in autophagy.
Exactly how beclin-1 is shifted preferentially to the mitochondria and how beclin-1-Bcl-2 binding initiates mitochondrial depolarization remain to be elucidated. We can
postulate that beclin-1 binding to Bcl-2 releases the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on Bak, leading to Bak-induced mitochondrial depolarization.
Another interesting finding is the early down-regulation of p-Akt without any associated down-regulation of
XIAP. XIAP is a substrate of Akt, and it has been demonstrated that XIAP is ubiquitinated and degraded by the
proteasome once it is dephosphorylated.27 Thus, it was
surprising to observe stable levels of XIAP coupled with
declining p-Akt. It is possible that several steps are
required for proteosomal degradation of XIAP and that
the ubiquitination of a dephosphorylated XIAP requires
other mechanisms. Another possibility is that phosphorylated XIAP may be quite stable, allowing it to maintain its
phosphorylation status for an extended time even with
declining levels of p-Akt. This stability in the level of
XIAP also may be the reason for the absence of caspase-9
and caspase-3 activation.
We also demonstrated that NV-128–induced mitochondrial depolarization leads to the nuclear translocation
of EndoG, but not AIF. This suggests that the mitochondrial insult induced by NV-128 is specific, allowing the
release of only some mitochondrial proteins and not a
complete mitochondrial rupture, which would have
released all resident mitochondrial proteins. Moreover,
the demonstration that AIF is not present in the nucleus

without any evident decrease in animal weight or activity.
In contrast, mice that received carboplatin lost more
weight than control mice and exhibited severe cachexia.
Moreover, we confirmed that the pathway described in
vitro also is the main pathway that is activated in vivo.
Although we have not identified the receptor/target
of NV-128 in EOC cells, we believe that the capacity of
NV-128 to inhibit p-mTOR triggers a cascade of events
leading to caspase-independent cell death in otherwise
chemoresistant EOC cells (Figs. 10A and B). This opens
new possibilities for the use of NV-128 as a potential
addition to conventional chemotherapy that targets EOC
cells.
The demonstration of a functional, caspase-independent cell death pathway in apoptotic-resistant EOC
cells is an important key step toward the development of
alternative targeted therapy for refractory patients. Further studies currently are ongoing to determine the main
target of this compound.

FIGURE 10. Proposed mechanism of NV-128–induced cell
death: (A) In unstimulated/healthy cells, the process of
autophagy is inhibited by mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) and antiapoptotic proteins, such as the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), inhibit apoptosis. EndoG indicates endonuclease G; Bak, Bcl-2 antagonist/killer; pS6K,
phosphorylated ribosomal p70 S6 kinase; pAKT, phosphorylated AKT; Bax, Bcl-2–associated X protein. (B) NV-128 treatment induces down-regulation of phosphorylated mTOR (pmTOR) and beclin-1 mitochondrial translocation. Mitochondrial beclin-1 inhibits Bcl-2, and the resulting mitochondrial
depolarization leads to EndoG nuclear translocation and
chromatin condensation. The connection between p-mTOR
and beclin-1 mitochondrial translocation remains to be determined. LC3-II is an autophagic marker.

The antitumoral activity of NV-128 was demonstrated further in our in vivo studies. NV-128 was superior to paclitaxel and carboplatin and was well tolerated at
its efficacious dose. It induced a significant decrease in tumor kinetics compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin
