Abstract
Prostate carcinomas frequently express estrogen receptors
(ER), irrespective of androgen receptor (AR) expression;
however, the role of ERs and estrogens in prostate cancer is
controversial. We found that 17B-estradiol (E2) is able to
markedly up-regulate insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I
receptor (IGF-IR) mRNA and protein expression in both ARpositive (LNCaP cells) and AR-negative (PC-3 cells) prostate
cancer cells. This effect occurs not only via ERA but also via
ERB stimulation and is specific for IGF-IR because it does not
involve the cognate insulin receptor. IGF-IR up-regulation is
associated with increased IGF-IR phosphorylation and with
increased mitogenic and motogenic activities in response to
IGF-I. IGF-IR up-regulation by E2 does not require ER binding
to DNA and is poorly sensitive to antiestrogen blockade,
whereas it is associated with the activation of cytosolic kinase
cascades involving Src, extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK)-1/2, and, to a lesser extent, phosphatidylinositol 3kinase and is sensitive to the inhibition of these kinases. In
conclusion, our data indicate that estrogens may contribute to
IGF system deregulation in prostate cancer through the
activation of a nongenotropic pathway. Estrogens may have
a role, therefore, in tumor progression to androgen independence. Inhibition of the IGF-IR or the Src-ERK pathway should
be considered, therefore, as an adjuvant therapy in prostate
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8932–41]

Introduction
Prostate carcinomas are usually androgen dependent in their
initial stages. However, although initially responsive to antiandrogen treatments, these carcinomas eventually progress to an
androgen-independent phenotype, for which no efficacious treatment is currently available. Deregulated growth and survival
signaling is a characteristic of androgen-independent tumors,
implying that factors other than androgens contribute to prostate
cancer progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that also
estrogens can have an effect on prostate cancer. Most primary
prostate cancers express a recently discovered subtype of the
estrogen receptor (the h subtype or ERh; ref. 1) whereas the classic
a subtype (ERa), which is predominant in breast cancer, is silenced

by DNA hypermethylation. Interestingly, the ERh subtype is
expressed in most metastases, suggesting that this receptor may
be a target in devising new treatments for late-stage prostate
cancer (2, 3). Moreover, ER antagonists may inhibit growth and/or
induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines that express either
only ERh or both ER subtypes (1, 4). Taken together, these data
suggest that estrogens could have a direct effect on prostate cancer.
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is another strong
candidate among the factors implicated in prostate cancer
progression. This system plays a key role in regulating growth,
resistance to apoptosis, and invasion in a variety of human
malignancies (5, 6), and various lines of evidence suggest a role for
the IGF system also in prostate cancer. IGF-I may increase proliferation of prostate cancer cells and protect them from apoptosis
(5, 7), whereas antisense-mediated IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) downregulation suppresses rat tumor growth in vivo and prevents
prostate cancer cell invasiveness (8). Similarly, IGF-IR blockade by
monoclonal antibodies induces growth inhibition in human
prostate cancer transplanted in immunodeficient mice (9).
Moreover, in human prostate cancer cell xenografts, progression
to androgen independence is associated with increased expression
of both IGF-IR and IGF-I (10, 11) and increased responsiveness to
IGF-I (12). Transgenic mice expressing human IGF-I in the prostate
basal epithelium have activated IGF-IR and are prone to
spontaneous prostate tumorigenesis (13). Finally, epidemiologic
studies found an association between borderline to high IGF-I
serum levels and prostate cancer risk (14). These data support the
hypothesis that the IGF system is involved in prostate cancer,
particularly in progression to androgen independence.
A number of studies have shown that estrogens and the IGF
system may functionally interact. Most of these studies regard the
ERa subtype and have been carried out in breast cancer MCF-7
cells. In these cells, estrogens are able to up-regulate insulin
receptor substrate-1 expression, leading to increased signaling
through the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in response to IGF-I (15, 16). Moreover,
estrogens increase IGF-I binding and IGF-IR mRNA expression in
MCF-7 cells (17), whereas the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 decreases
IGF-IR mRNA levels (18). The two ER subtypes, however, affect in a
partially different way the IGF system; ERa, but not ERh,
transactivates the IGF-I promoter (19). Down-regulation of IGFbinding proteins is another mechanism through which estrogens
may increase IGF-I response (20). The functional interactions
between estrogens and the IGF system in prostate cancer are
largely unknown.
We now report that estrogens markedly up-regulate the IGF-IR
in prostate cancer cells. This effect is specific for IGF-IR because it
does not occur for the cognate insulin receptor and can be
mediated not only by ERa but also by ERh. IGF-IR up-regulation by
estrogens occurs also in androgen receptor (AR)–negative prostate

cancer cells and does not require ER binding to DNA but it requires
the activation of the Src-extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK)-1/2 pathway. Estrogens may therefore enhance the biological
effects of IGFs in prostate cancer cells through a ‘‘nongenotropic’’
pathway (i.e., by a kinase-initiated effect that does not involve
steroid receptor binding to canonical steroid response elements on
DNA but may eventually affect gene transcription; ref. 21).

luciferase assay, cells were lysed and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega Corp.). Luciferase activity was normalized
for transfection efficiency using a vector coding for the H2B-GFP reporter
gene (pBOS H2B-GFP-N1; provided by Dr. J. Wang, Division of Biological
Sciences and the Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA).
For SRE-SEAP activity, supernatant was collected and SEAP activity
measured using the Great EscAPe SEAP Chemiluminescence Kit (Clontech
Laboratories, Inc.). The activity of each sample was measured by a
multilabel counter Wallac 1420 VICTOR 3 (Perkin-Elmer).
IGF-IR and insulin receptor measurement and IGF-I binding
studies. Cell lysate preparation and IGF-IR and insulin receptor measurements were carried out by Western blot analysis as previously described
(23, 24). For binding studies, LNCaP cells grown to f60% confluence were
serum starved and further cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L
E2, R1881, or vehicle for 24 h. Cells (3  106) were then incubated with
125
I-IGF-I (10 pmol/L) for further 16 h at 4jC in the presence of increasing
concentrations of cold IGF-I and cell-associated radioactivity was then
measured in a gamma counter. Scatchard analysis was done with GraphPad
Prism 4 software.
IGF-IR and ERK1/2 activation. For IGF-IR activation, cells were serum
starved in medium without phenol red 24 h before stimulation with
10 nmol/L IGF-I. Cells were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycolate, 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L
NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 10 Ag/mL leupeptin.
The insoluble material was separated by centrifugation and the supernatants
were incubated at 4jC for 2 h with 4 Ag of the anti–IGF-IR aIR3 antibody
coated with protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to
SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes, immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody, and
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The filter was then stripped
with buffer Restore (Pierce) and reprobed with an anti–IGF-IR antibody.
For ERK1/2 activation, cells were stimulated with 10 nmol/L E2 and lysed
in Laemmli buffer containing 62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10%
glycerol, 50 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue. Cell lysates were
subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gel. The resolved
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with anti–phospho-specific ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody. The filters
were then stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody.
Analysis of protein-to-protein interactions. Cells were serum starved
in medium without phenol red for 24 h and stimulated with E2 or R1881 for
2 min. Cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer without sodium deoxycolate. The
insoluble material was separated by centrifugation and the supernatants
were incubated at 4jC under rotation for 18 h with anti–v-Src antibody or
anti-ER antibodies. At the end of the incubation, immunocomplexes were
separated by adding 30 AL of mix protein A/G-Sepharose for additional
30 min. The pellets were washed with lysis buffer four times and the protein
was reduced in 40 AL of Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The
resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted with specific antibody, and detected by ECL.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA (5 Ag) was reverse transcribed
with ThermoScript RT (Invitrogen) and Oligo dT primers. Synthesized
cDNA (50 ng) was then combined in a PCR reaction using primers 5¶TTTCTGACAACGCCAAGGA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CAGGGTAGACGGCAGTTCAA-3¶ (reverse) specific for AR ( fragment size, 341 bp); 5¶-GGCTCCGCAAATGCTACGAA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AGCGCCAGACGAGACCAATC-3¶
(reverse) specific for ERa ( fragment size, 462 bp); and 5¶-ATACTTGCCCACGAATCTTT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGTGATAACTGGCGATGGAC-3¶ (reverse)
specific for ERh ( fragment size, 375 bp). ELE-1 (housekeeping gene)
amplification was done with the following primers: 5¶-ATTGAAGAAATTGCAGGCTC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGGAGAAGAGAGGCTGTATCT-3¶ (reverse;
fragment size, 280 bp). PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles of
30 s at 95jC, 30 s at 60jC, and 30 s at 72jC. The PCR products were analyzed
by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide.

(25 ng) was then combined in a PCR reaction using primers 5¶-GGGCCATCAGGATTGAGAAA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CACAGGCCGTGTCGTTGTCA-3¶
(reverse) specific for the IGF-IR ( fragment size, 330 bp). ELE-1 amplification
was done as described earlier. Quantitative real-time PCR was done on an
ABI Prism 7500 (PE Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(PE Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification reactions were checked for the presence of nonspecific products by
dissociation curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Relative quantitative determination of target gene levels was done by comparing DC t (25).
Cell cycle, apoptosis evaluation, and cell migration. Cells were grown
to f60% confluence, serum starved in medium without phenol red for 24 h,
and further cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L E2 for 24 h.
The medium was then replaced with medium containing 1% stripped serum
and, after 4 h, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L
IGF-I for 8 h.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested and permeabilized in ethanol
70% for 18 h at 20jC, then centrifuged and resuspended in PBS containing
16 Ag/mL propidium iodide plus 160 Ag/mL RNase, incubated for 30 min in
the dark, and then subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS;
Coulter Elite flow cytometer, Beckman Coulter).
For apoptosis evaluation, cells were treated as indicated in Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences). Annexin-positive cells
were scored by FACS analysis. Values obtained were expressed as percent
of Annexin-positive cells over the total cell population. For cell migration
assay, cells were treated as previous reported (26).

E2 binding to AR-T877A, we stably transfected HEK293 cells with
either AR-T877A or wild-type AR. As shown in Fig. 2A, E2 was unable
to up-regulate IGF-IR in HEK293 cells transfected with either ART877A or wild-type AR, whereas R1881 was effective in both cases.
To evaluate whether, in addition to ERh (the only ER subtype
expressed by LNCaP cells), ERa is also able to up-regulate IGF-IR,
we transfected HEK293 cells with either ERa or ERh cDNA
(Fig. 2B). Exposure of these cells to E2 resulted in IGF-IR upregulation in all cases (Fig. 2B), whereas R1881 was ineffective.
Taken together, these data indicate that E2 is able to up-regulate
IGF-IR by binding to both ERa and ERh and not by cross-reaction

Results
E2 induces IGF-IR up-regulation in LNCaP prostate cancer
cells. LNCaP cells expressed the h, but not the a, isoform of the
estrogen receptor (ERh), as evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR; data not shown). When exposed to E2 for 24 h, these cells
showed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of IGF-IR
protein, whereas its close homologue insulin receptor was not
affected (Fig. 1A). E2 effect on IGF-IR expression was evident
at a dose as low as 0.01 nmol/L and reached a maximum at 1 to
100 nmol/L (Fig. 1A). Time-course experiments indicated that
IGF-IR expression started to increase after 4-h cell exposure to
10 nmol/L E2 and reached a maximum after 24 h (Fig. 1B). A
24-h incubation was used in all subsequent studies.
Functional characteristics of IGF-IR in LNCaP cells preincubated with E2. To evaluate possible changes in ligand binding
characteristics associated with IGF-IR up-regulation, we carried
out a Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-IGF-I binding to LNCaP cells
cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L E2 for 24 h. Cells
treated with E2 showed a 4-fold increase of specific IGF-I binding
( from 5.5 to 22.7 pmol/L/106 cells) as compared with untreated
cells. The dissociation constant (K d), however, remained similar
(0.32 versus 0.40 nmol/L in estrogen-treated or untreated cells,
respectively) showing that E2 increases IGF-I binding sites but only
minimally affects the receptor affinity for IGF-I (Fig. 1C). In the
same experiment, R1881 increased specific IGF-I binding by 7-fold
( from 5.5 to 38.7 pmol/L/106 cells; Fig. 1C). To evaluate whether the
increased IGF-I binding capacity caused an enhanced IGF-I
signaling, we measured IGF-IR autophosphorylation in response
to IGF-I in LNCaP cells either preincubated or not with 10 nmol/L
E2 for 24 h. Time-course experiments indicated that IGF-IR
autophosphorylation in response to IGF-I was markedly enhanced
by preincubation with E2 (Fig. 1D).
IGF-IR up-regulation is not due to E2 binding to AR-T877A
of LNCaP cells and can be mediated by both ERA and ERB.
The AR expressed by LNCaP cells bears a point mutation, ART877A, which affects AR binding specificity (27). To ascertain
whether IGF-IR up-regulation could be mediated, at least in part, by

with AR-T877A. We then evaluated whether E2 is able to upregulate IGF-IR also in AR-negative prostate cancer cells and
whether ectopic AR expression has any influence on the effect of E2
in transfected cells. To this aim, we used androgen-independent
PC-3 prostate cancer cells that express both ER subtypes (a and h)
but not AR (confirmed by RT-PCR; data not shown). In addition to
wild-type PC-3, we also studied two PC-3 cell clones transfected
with AR cDNA and expressing AR to different degrees: the PC-3AR6 clone, with an AR expression only slightly lower than LNCaP
cells, and the PC-3-AR13 clone, with an AR content f6- to 8-fold
lower than LNCaP cells (Fig. 2C). IGF-IR up-regulation by R1881
was strictly related to the AR content in these cell clones and it did
not occur in wild-type PC-3. In contrast, E2 up-regulated IGF-IR
also in wild-type PC-3. The presence of AR, however, slightly
enhanced the effect of E2 (Fig. 2C). To confirm immunoblotting
data, we carried out Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-IGF-I binding
data in PC-3 cells cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L
E2 for 24 h. E2 treatment increased specific IGF-I binding from
13.1 to 26.3 pmol/L/106 cells. The K d was similar (0.30 versus
0.22 nmol/L in estrogen-treated or untreated cells, respectively;
Fig. 2D). As expected, R1881 was ineffective (Fig. 2D).
Estrogen-induced IGF-IR up-regulation is mediated by a
nongenotropic signaling pathway and requires Src/ERK1/2
activity. In previous studies, we found that androgen-mediated
IGF-IR up-regulation is due to the activation of a nongenotropic
pathway (26). We evaluated, therefore, whether E2-induced IGF-IR
up-regulation also depends on a similar mechanism. We first
evaluated the effect of two synthetic estrogen-like compounds,
estren (4-estren-3a,17h-diol), which induces only nongenotropic
activities of ER, and a pyrazole compound, which induces the
transcriptional activities of ER with minimal effects on the
nongenotropic pathway (28). To confirm the specific activity of
these two ligands in our system, we used a construct encoding for
SRE-SEAP that is efficiently induced by both ERa and ERh when
located in the cytoplasm but is repressed by ERs present in the
nucleus (21). As expected, estren, but not pyrazole, stimulated
SEAP activity (Fig. 3A). In LNCaP cells, estren stimulated IGF-IR
up-regulation to a similar degree as E2, whereas pyrazole was
ineffective (Fig. 3A), suggesting that nongenotropic pathways
mediate IGF-IR up-regulation.
We next evaluated the possible involvement of the Src/Raf-1/
ERK pathway. Indeed, exposure of LNCaP cells to E2 increased
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, top). LNCaP cells were then
incubated with E2 in the presence or absence of various kinase
inhibitors, including PD98059, a MEK-1 inhibitor, PP2, a Src
inhibitor, and LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. IGF-IR up-regulation by
E2 was almost completely blocked by both PD98059 (50 Amol/L)
and PP2 (10 Amol/L), whereas LY294002 (20 Amol/L) was less
effective (Fig. 3B, middle). Similar results were obtained in HEK293
cells transfected with either ERa or ERh, although the effect of
LY294002 was only evident in cells transfected with ERa (Fig. 3B,
bottom). The antiestrogen ICI 182,780, which is an inhibitor of ER
transcription, only slightly inhibited E2-induced IGF-IR up-regulation in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3C).
To confirm the involvement of Src, LNCaP cells were stimulated
with either E2 or R1881 and then lysed and immunoprecipitated
with anti-Src antibody. Immunoblotting with anti-ERh antibodies
confirmed that E2 stimulation and, to a much lower extent, R1881
induced ERh association to Src. R1881, but not E2, induced AR
association to Src (Fig. 3D ). Both R1881 and E2 induced
recruitment to Src of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Moreover,

either the wild-type AR (ARwt ) or the AR-T877A mutant. Control cells were
transfected with an empty vector. Transfected cells were then exposed
to 10 nmol/L R1881 or E2 for 24 h and IGF-IR expression was measured by
Western blot analysis. Filters were reblotted with an anti–h-actin antibody.

IGF-IR expression was measured by Western blot analysis. Filters were
reblotted with an anti-ERa antibody, with an anti-ERh antibody, and then with
an anti–h-actin antibody. C, IGF-IR protein expression. PC-3 cells were stably
transfected with plasmids coding for the wild-type AR, and two cell clones
(PC-3AR6 and PC-3AR13), expressing AR to different degrees, were selected

and PC-3 selected clones were then exposed to 10 nmol/L R1881 or E2 for
24 h and IGF-IR was detected by Western blot. Membranes were reblotted with
an anti–h-actin antibody. AR, ERa, and ERh protein expression was also
detected by Western blot. D, IGF-I binding. Competition-inhibition curves of

immunoprecipitation with anti-ERh antibody showed that ERh
associates with AR following stimulation with either E2 or R1881
(Fig. 3D). Exposure to E2 also stimulated the association of ERh
with the p85 subunit of PI3K (Fig. 3D). We also studied the ability
of E2 to induce association of either ERa or ERh with p85 and Src
in the absence of AR. To this aim, we cotransfected HEK293 cells
with a myc-tagged p85 construct together with either ERa or ERh

cDNA. Cells incubated in the presence or absence of E2 were
immunoprecipitated with anti-ER antibodies and blotted with antimyc or anti-Src antibodies. Cell exposure to E2 induced association
of both ERa and ERh to p85 and Src (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, these data indicate that E2-induced IGF-IR upregulation occurs through the activation of nongenotropic
signaling pathways involving Src and ERK1/2 activation, and that

Figure 3. IGF-IR up-regulation by E2 occurs via a nongenotropic pathway. A, IGF-IR protein expression was up-regulated by E2 or estren but not by pyrazole through
a nongenotropic pathway. After cell exposure to E2, pyrazole, or estren (10 nmol/L) for 24 h, E2 and estren (as well as R1881 used as control), but not pyrazole,
stimulated IGF-IR up-regulation in LNCaP cells. To confirm the nongenotropic activity induced by E2 and estren, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid
coding for a reporter construct in which SRE drives the expression of SEAP. Again, E2 and estren, but not pyrazole, stimulated SEAP activity (top ). B, inhibition
of estrogen-induced IGF-IR up-regulation by kinase inhibitors. In LNCaP cells, E2 activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as evaluated by Western blot analysis with a
phosphospecific anti–phospho ERK1/2 antibody (top ). LNCaP cells were then incubated with 10 nmol/L E2 for 24 h in the presence or absence of 50 Amol/L PD98059
(MEK-1 inhibitor), 10 Amol/L PP2 (Src inhibitor), or 20 Amol/L LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor; middle). Parallel experiments were carried out in HEK293 cells transfected
with either ERa or ERh cDNAs (bottom ). IGF-IR expression was then measured by Western blot analysis. Membranes were reblotted with an anti–h-actin antibody
to control for protein loading. C, the specific antiestrogen ICI 182,780 does not affect IGF-IR up-regulation. Serum-starved LNCaP cells were treated with R1881 or
E2 (both 10 nmol/L) in the presence or absence of ICI 182,780 (1 or 10 Amol/L) for 24 h. IGF-IR expression was then measured by Western blot analysis. Membranes were
reblotted with an anti–h-actin antibody to control for protein loading. D, E2 and R1881 induce the association of ER with Src, p85, and AR. Left, serum-starved
LNCaP cells were treated with R1881 or E2 (both 10 nmol/L) for 2 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Src antibody or with control antibody and the
association with ERh, p85 of PI3K, or AR was evaluated by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. In the same cell lysates, ERh was also immunoprecipitated with
an anti-ERh antibody and association with AR and p85 was measured by immunoblotting. Right, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged wild-type p85
and either ERa or ERh cDNAs or the empty vector. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-ERa or an anti-ERh antibody and immunoblotted with specific
antibodies to Myc-tag or Src. Representative of three independent experiments.

17b-Estradiol Up-Regulates IGF-IR in Prostate Cancer

Figure 4. IGF-IR mRNA expression is up-regulated by E2 in LNCaP cells. A, E2-induced IGF-IR up-regulation requires both de novo mRNA and protein synthesis.
Serum-starved LNCaP cells were incubated with 10 nmol/L E2 in the presence or absence of either actinomycin D (1 Ag/mL) or cyclohexemide (10 Ag/mL).
IGF-IR protein was detected by immunoblotting and h-actin was used to control for protein load. B, total RNA prepared from LNCaP cells was used as template for
real-time quantitative PCR for IGF-IR mRNA. Relative mRNA amounts were normalized to the abundance of the ELE-1 mRNA. R1881 (10 nmol/L) is shown as
positive control. Columns, means of three separate experiments; bars, SD. C, dose-dependent increase of IGF-IR mRNA by E2. Serum-starved LNCaP cells were
incubated in the presence or absence of the indicated doses of E2 for 24 h; total RNA prepared from LNCaP cells was used as template for quantitative real-time
PCR. Relative mRNA amounts were normalized to the abundance of the ELE-1 mRNA. Columns, mean of three separate experiments; bars, SD. D, time-course
regulation of IGF-IR mRNA expression. Serum-starved LNCaP cells were incubated with or without 10 nmol/L E2 for the indicated times. Total RNA prepared from
LNCaP cells was used as template for quantitative real-time PCR. Relative mRNA amounts were normalized to the abundance of the ELE-1 mRNA. Columns, mean of
three separate experiments; bars, SD.

E2 stimulates the association of both ERa and ERh with Src and
the p85 subunit of PI3K. In LNCaP cells, E2 also induces AR
association with Src and ER.
E2 stimulates IGF-IR mRNA expression and IGF-IR promoter
activity. To evaluate whether IGF-IR protein up-regulation after cell
exposure to E2 was due to reduced degradation or increased
synthesis, LNCaP cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 nmol/L E2 in
the absence or presence of either actinomycin D or cycloheximide.
Both compounds completely inhibited IGF-IR up-regulation by E2,
suggesting that both de novo mRNA and protein synthesis are
required for this effect (Fig. 4A). IGF-IR mRNA expression, measured
by quantitative real-time PCR, increased by f4-fold after 10 nmol/L
E2 for 24 h; this increase was also blocked by either actinomycin D or
cycloheximide (Fig. 4B). Dose-response experiments indicated that
IGF-IR mRNA started to increase with cell exposure to 0.01 nmol/L
E2 and reached maximum levels with 10 nmol/L E2 (Fig. 4C). IGF-IR
mRNA started to increase at 2 to 4 h after exposure to 10 nmol/L E2
and reached maximum levels at 24 h (Fig. 4D).
To evaluate whether the increased mRNA expression in response
to E2 was reflected by an increased activity of the IGF-IR promoter,
we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding
the wild-type ER together with one of the three following luciferase
constructs, each containing sequences of the IGF-IR promoter: the
full-length promoter region (bp 476/+640), the 5¶-flanking
fragment (bp 41/+640), and the 5¶-UTR fragment ( 476/+41).
Cotransfection with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector was
used to normalize for transfection efficiency. After exposure to E2,
an increase in luciferase activity was observed in cells transfected
with either the full-length fragment or the 5¶-UTR promoter
fragment (142 F 12% and 138 F 16% of unstimulated cells,
respectively). In contrast, no luciferase increase was seen in cells
transfected with the 5¶-flanking fragment, indicating that the

www.aacrjournals.org

sequences responsible for E2 stimulation are between bp 41 and
+640 of the IGF-IR promoter region (not shown). We then
evaluated the full-length IGF-IR promoter activity after cotransfection with either ERa or ERh or AR-T877A. As expected, the
promoter activity was increased by E2 in the presence of ERa or
ERh but not AR-T877A (Fig. 5A).
We then evaluated whether IGF-IR promoter activity stimulation
by E2 also involved a nongenotropic signal. To this aim, we
transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding either an ER
mutant targeted to the plasma membrane (E-Mem-CFP) or an ER
mutant targeted to the nucleus (E-Nuc-CFP). The first ER form is
unable to bind to DNA but retains the ability to activate the ERK
pathway, whereas the second ER form is entrapped in the nucleus
and unable to activate the ERK pathway. Receptor localization in
transfected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B,
top). To confirm the specific activity of the two mutant receptors,
we used a SRE-SEAP construct that is induced by the ERs located
in the cytoplasm but is repressed by ERs present in the nucleus
(21). As expected, E2 induced SRE-SEAP activity in the presence of
E-Mem-CFP but not in the presence of E-Nuc-CFP (Fig. 5B, bottom).
HEK293 cells were then transiently cotransfected with plasmids
encoding each of the mutant ER constructs and luciferase
constructs containing the full-length IGF-IR promoter. Both E2
and estren were able to stimulate the IGF-IR promoter activity in
cells transfected with the DNA binding–defective E-Mem-CFP but
not in cells transfected with the ER mutant targeted to the nucleus
(E-Nuc-CFP; Fig. 5C). To gain additional insight into IGF-IR
promoter regulation by E2, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with a
luciferase construct containing the full-length IGF-IR promoter
together with either ERa or ERh cDNA and with plasmids
encoding either a dominant-negative MEK-1 or a dominantnegative C/EBP transcription factor. Both dominant-negatives

completely blocked IGF-IR promoter activity in response to E2
(Fig. 5D).
Biological effects of estrogen-induced IGF-IR up-regulation.
We aimed to evaluate whether E2-induced IGF-IR up-regulation
enhanced the biological effects of IGF-I. To ascertain whether AR
was required for E2 effects, we carried out parallel experiments in
both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. IGF-I was a weak stimulator of LNCaP
and PC-3 cell proliferation. However, preincubation with E2
significantly enhanced cell proliferation in response to IGF-I. The
proportion of cells in S phase increased, on average, from f8% to

14% in LNCaP cells and from f34% to 40% in PC-3 cells (Fig. 6A
and B). These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01).
A similar enhancing effect of E2 preincubation was observed with
regard to the antiapoptotic effect of IGF-I. IGF-I was barely
protective from starvation-induced apoptosis (Annexin staining) in
untreated LNCaP cells and virtually ineffective in PC-3 cells, which
were less sensitive to serum starvation. However, IGF-I significantly
reduced apoptosis in E2-preincubated cells both in LNCaP and
PC-3 (Fig. 6C). We also studied migration in cells seeded in Boyden
chambers, coated at the lower side with 250 Ag/mL collagen, after

24 h. Supernatants were collected and SEAP activity was assayed as described in Materials and Methods. SEAP activity was not observed when using nuclear-targeted

Transfected cells were serum starved for 16 h and then exposed to 10 nmol/L E2 or estren for 24 h; cellular lysates were collected and IGF-IR promoter activity
was assayed. No effect of estrogen on the IGF-IR promoter is observed when using nuclear-targeted (E-Nuc-CFP) plasmid. Columns, means of three separate

stimulation with 10 nmol/L IGF-I. Also in this case, the effect of
IGF-I was very small or absent in cells not preincubated with
E2. In contrast, IGF-I consistently stimulated migration in E2preincubated cells, although this effect did not reach statistical
significance (data not shown).

Discussion
The IGF system plays a key role in the development and
maintenance of the transformed phenotype in a variety of
experimental models (5, 6, 29) and human malignancies, including
prostate cancer (5, 22, 30–33). In this tumor, deregulation of various
components of the IGF system has been reported at different

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor stages (11, 34, 35) and may play a role in prostate cancer
progression to androgen-independence (10). We previously
reported up-regulation of IGF-IR in LNCaP prostate cancer cells
by androgens (26). In other models, such as breast cancer, several
components of the IGF system may be up-regulated by estrogens
through the classic ERa (17, 36, 37).
In the present study, therefore, we investigated whether E2
up-regulates IGF-IR also in prostate cancer cells, and found that
both IGF-IR content and autophosphorylation are increased after
exposure to E2 in both AR-positive and AR-negative prostate cancer
cells. Moreover, E2 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to the biological
effects of IGF-I. These E2 effects do not require ER binding to
specific DNA sequences (estrogen response elements) but rather

involve the activation of cytosolic kinases such as Src and ERK1/2
that subsequently induce an increase of IGF-IR promoter activity
and gene transcription. This E2 effect on IGF-IR expression must be
considered, therefore, as a nongenotropic action of estrogens.
Various lines of experimental evidence support this conclusion.
First, the Src inhibitor PP2 and the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059
completely block the IGF-IR protein up-regulation by E2, both in
LNCaP cells and in HEK293 transfected with either ERa or ERh.
The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 partially blocks the E2 effect in LNCaP
cells, suggesting also an involvement of PI3K. Moreover, E2
exposure stimulates the association of both ERa and ERh with
Src and p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Second, estren, a
synthetic ER ligand that induces ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activation
without affecting ER binding to DNA (38), reproduces this E2 effect.
In contrast, pyrazole, a compound that activates only the
genotropic actions of E2, is ineffective. Third, E2 activates the
IGF-IR promoter in cells transfected with a mutant ER devoid of
DNA binding activity while retaining the nongenotropic activity; in
contrast, a mutant ER that localizes in the nucleus and is devoid of
nongenotropic activity is without effect.
The present results showing a major role of Src in mediating E2
effects are supported by previous studies indicating that E2 activates
a Src-dependent pathway by inducing an interaction between the
ER phosphotyrosine 537 and the SH2 domain of Src (39, 40). Other
studies have also shown that ER, Src, and p85 form a ternary
complex, whose assembly is stimulated by E2 and which induces the
activation of both the Src and the PI3K/Akt pathways (39).
Activation of these kinase cascades will eventually affect gene
expression by affecting multiple transcription factors, including Elk1, which in turn activates expression of c-fos and down-regulation of
C/EBPh and c-Jun (21). Our preliminary results show that inhibition
of C/EBPh actually blocks E2-induced IGF-IR promoter activity.
This is a novel observation, and we are currently investigating the
exact mechanism involving C/EBPh in this regulation.
Because in LNCaP cells, both DHT and the synthetic androgen
R1881 are potent inducers of IGF-IR (26) via the mutated AR (ART877A) expressed in these cells, we evaluated the possibility that
the effect of E2 could occur by cross-reaction with AR-T877A.
Experiments in transfected HEK293 cells indicated that IGF-IR upregulation after E2 occurred via both ER subtypes but neither via
wild-type AR nor via AR-T877A.
Data about ER subtype expression and functions in prostate
epithelial cancer cells are limited. The classic ERa subtype is not
expressed in normal prostate epithelium but is expressed in prostate
stromal cells (1, 41), suggesting that estrogen effects on the prostate
were mediated by factors produced by stromal cells. Then the ERh
subtype was discovered (42) and found expressed by the prostate
malignant epithelium as well as ERa (41). However, the precise roles

of ER subtypes in prostate cancer are unknown. In breast cancer,
ERa is the major modulator of estrogen tumor-promoting effects
whereas the role of ERh is still controversial (43–46). In the prostate,
ERh is frequently expressed in dysplastic and cancerous prostate
tissues and also in metastases (3, 47) whereas the ERa gene is often
silenced. When expressed as the only ER subtype, ERh may stimulate
cell proliferation (47). Therefore, the relative abundance of the two
ER subtypes may be important in determining the final biological
effect. Our study suggests that, as far as nongenotropic effects are
concerned, both receptor subtypes behave similarly.
In summary, our data show that E2 specifically up-regulates IGFIR in prostate cancer cells and sensitizes cancer cells to the
biological effects of IGF-I. The E2 effect can occur through both
ERa and ERh and does not involve ER binding to DNA but rather
the activation of kinase cascades initiated by the association
between ER-Src and PI3K and followed by ERK1/2 phosphorylation. AR expression is not required, although AR coexpression may
potentiate the E2 effect by associating with ER. These data raise
several potential implications in prostate cancer development and
treatment. First, estrogens may enhance the biological effects of
IGFs by up-regulating IGF-IR both in AR-positive and AR-negative
prostate cancers. Second, because ERh is expressed in both normal
and precancerous prostate epithelium, it is possible that environmental xenoestrogens may mimic the nongenotropic effects of E2
and represent a risk factor for prostate cancer. Third, the modest
results observed with the antiestrogen tamoxifen in prostate cancer
(48) may be partially explained by the fact that tamoxifen is a
partial ER agonist. Fourth, we now show that also the pure
antiestrogen ICI 182,780 is only partially effective in antagonizing
E2-induced IGF-IR up-regulation, whereas Src and ERK1/2
inhibitors can better block this effect. In light of these observations,
inhibitors of the IGF-IR or the Src-ERK pathway should be
considered as an adjuvant therapy in prostate cancer.
