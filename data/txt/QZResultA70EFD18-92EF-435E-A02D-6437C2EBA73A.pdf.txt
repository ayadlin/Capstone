Abstract
Conventional development of multivariate gene expression
models (GEM) predicting therapeutic response of cancer patients is based on analysis of patients treated with specific regimens, which limits generalization to different or novel drug
combinations. We overcome this limitation by developing
GEMs based on in vitro drug sensitivities and microarray analyses of the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. These GEMs were
evaluated in blind fashion as predictors of tumor response
and/or patient survival in seven independent cohorts of patients with breast (n = 275), bladder (n = 59), and ovarian
(n = 143) cancer treated with multiagent chemotherapy, of
which 233 patients were from prospectively enrolled clinical
trials. In all studies, GEMs effectively stratified tumor response and patient survival independent of established clinical and pathologic tumor variables. In bladder cancer
patients treated with neoadjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine,
Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cisplatin, the 3-year overall
survival for those with favorable GEM scores was 81% versus
33% for those with less favorable scores (P = 0.002). GEMs for
breast cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin
(doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide and ovarian cancer patients treated with platinum-containing regimens also stratified patient survival [5-year overall survival 100% versus 74%
(P = 0.05) and 3-year overall survival 68% versus 43% (P =
0.008), respectively]. Importantly, clinical prediction using
our in vitro GEM was superior to that of conventionally derived GEMs. We show a facile yet effective approach to GEM
derivation that identifies patients most likely to benefit from
selected multiagent therapy. Use of such in vitro–based GEMs
may provide a robust and generalizable approach to personalized cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(21):8302–9]

Introduction
Most cancer patients with advanced tumors undergo combination pharmacotherapy. A challenge in treating these patients is
predicting which individuals will respond to a specific therapy. Recent studies have shown the potential that tumor response to chemotherapeutics can be predicted using multivariate gene
expression models (GEM; ref. 1, 2). Such GEMs are developed using
a training microarray set from tumors of human patients with

known clinical responses to the drug(s), allowing selection of optimal marker genes and respective expression levels to construct
such models (3, 4). These are then evaluated in separate patient
cohorts to determine their predictive ability. Although validation
is straightforward, formulation of such GEMs is lengthy and expensive and requires human tumor tissue from patients treated with
the specific drug regimen for which the GEM prediction is desired.
In addition, this approach does not permit a priori prediction of
responses to single or combination therapy that has never been
clinically used, limiting the pairing of novel agents to their optimal
disease types, thus hindering identification of novel applications of
established agents.
To overcome these limitations, two recent studies derived GEMs
based on biomarkers of in vitro drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines
in the NCI-60 panel (5, 6) and showed that such GEMs can predict
the clinical outcome in patients who received systemic therapy. Although promising, these reports did not provide validation of unaltered GEMs on multiple independent patient data sets. If such
GEMs can maintain a robust prediction in this setting, this approach has the potential to revolutionize personalized cancer therapy and drug development because forecasting the clinical
effectiveness of a compound could be undertaken very early in
the drug development lifecycle (7).
Here, we develop and apply GEMs derived from in vitro data
and show the ability of these to predict clinical responses to
combination pharmacotherapy regimens in 477 patients with
three common cancer types reported in retrospective studies
or prospective clinical trials. Importantly, the patient cohorts examined came from ethnically and geographically distinct regions.

Materials and Methods
Patient Data Sets for GEM Development and Evaluation
In vitro drug activity and microarray data of the NCI-60 cancer cell panel
were described previously elsewhere (6). Microarray gene expression data
without associated treatment or clinical outcome information from three
human tumor sample cohorts were used for GEM development including
bladder cancer (n = 89; ref. 8), ovarian cancer (n = 99; ref. 9), and breast
cancer (n = 251; ref. 10). These comprise the training set (Fig. 1). For
GEM evaluation, through our own efforts and collaborations, we acquired
and used seven independent test sets in which data from microarray gene
expression could be linked to clinical outcome. Test set studies included
two bladder cancer (n = 59), two ovarian cancer (n = 143), and three breast
cancer (n = 275) sets of patients treated with multiagent pharmacotherapy
(Table 1). Of these, 233 patients were prospectively enrolled in clinical trials
(BR-TX and BR-Ger). Training and test microarray data sets are publicly
available or were obtained directly from the original authors. When survival
or tumor response data (complete response, partial response, or down-grade/
stage) were not publicly available, this information was obtained from the
original investigators. Note that these test set studies included geographically
and ethnically diverse populations with various tumor stages and tumor

sampling methodologies and did not share any patients or clinical locations
with the sets used for GEM development (Table 1; Fig. 1).

Statistical Analysis
GEM development. The COXEN algorithm (6), originally shown to predict single-agent chemosensitivity for a cell line panel and small breast cancer
sets, was expanded and refined to derive GEMs and subsequent GEM-predicted
chemosensitivity probabilities (named “GEM scores”) in patients with bladder, ovarian, and breast cancer (Fig. 1; Supplementary Methods). Briefly, each
microarray data set was first standardized within each gene for consistent
GEM development and evaluation. Chemosensitivity biomarkers for each
compound were then identified in the NCI-60 microarray data set by comparing each gene's differential expression between the sensitive and resistant
cells for each compound. These biomarkers were next triaged based on the
COXEN coefficient, which represents the degree of concordance of expression between the NCI-60 set and one of three cancer patient microarray data
sets used for development—BR-251, BL-89, or OV-99 (6). This resulted in a
panel of 15 to 95 gene probe sets per compound that were used for the
GEM training of statistical multivariate classification modeling between
the NCI-60 sensitive and resistant cell lines for that compound. Individual
compound GEMs were then combined to generate the prediction model
for relevant combination pharmacotherapy, assuming the modes of action
of individual compounds in combination chemotherapy were independent.
Importantly, this model development and training did not use any clinical
information or microarray data from the test sets used for GEM evaluation, thus maintaining strict independence between training and test data
sets (11).
GEM evaluation. We compared the GEM scores between clinical responders and nonresponders as reported in five studies for which tumor
response data after pharmacotherapy were available (Fig. 1). The signifi-

www.aacrjournals.org

cance of this score difference was evaluated using the two-sample t test
between the responder and nonresponder patient groups. In the two
studies for which tumor response data were not available, OV-GA and
BR-Tai, we compared GEM scores between actual surviving and deceased
patients—the only available information of patient outcomes in these two
studies—using the absolute call of patients' survival as a surrogate metric
for tumor response. Patient survival would have depended not only on
chemotherapeutic response but also on many other clinical factors, but
we simply tested whether the survivor group was more enriched with
predicted responders to chemotherapy. Once a GEM was derived for a
particular agent or combination of agents in a cancer type, it was used
without any alteration in all subsequent evaluations. Where information
on patient survival time was available, we performed Kaplan-Meier analyses on five cohorts stratified by the GEM scores from the analyses of
tumor response. To classify predicted responders from predicted nonresponders a priori, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted (Supplementary Fig. S1). The optimal cutoff on the ROC curve was
determined by maximizing the so-called Youden index (= sensitivity +
specificity - 1), at which sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
and negative predictive value were evaluated for each combination GEM
in stratifying patients' clinical response (12).
Relationship between GEM and clinical parameters. We examined
whether our multivariate GEM scores are correlated with conventional
clinical parameter information such tumor stage, grade, and well-known
marker types (e.g., estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2)
in breast cancer. We first calculated simple univariate (rank-based Spearman or binary) correlations between the GEM scores and each of clinical
parameters. Next, to see the relationship between GEM scores and combined clinical information, we measured the correlation between the GEM
scores and a published clinical variable-based breast cancer nomogram that

and the type and number of chemotherapy treatments (13).

GEM Stratification of Tumor Response and Absolute
Patient Survival
Bladder cancer. Using prospectively predicted and outcomeblinded GEM scores, the single-drug GEMs of Adriamycin and
cisplatin provided scores of responder patients, which were significantly higher than those of nonresponders (Adriamycin GEM
score with two-sample t test P = 0.049 and 0.061 and cisplatin
GEM score with P = 0.007 and 0.012) in both the neoadjuvant
(BL-Jap) and the advanced tumor (BL-Den) studies (Table 2).
The GEM score for methotrexate and vinblastine was significantly different only in the BL-Jap study (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002). The
single-drug GEMs of methotrexate, vinblastine, Adriamycin
(doxorubicin), and cisplatin (MVAC) were then combined to formulate the combination GEM for MVAC response. Using this
combination GEM, a significant difference in scores was observed between responders and nonresponders in both studies
(P = 0.002 and 0.033). This combination GEM provided sensitivity

of 83%, specificity of 64%, positive predictive value of 71%, and
negative predictive value of 78% at the cutoff value maximizing
the Youden index; the overall significance of ROC curve against
random classification was also extremely significant (P < 0.001,
Wilcoxon test; Supplementary Fig. S1). Note again that each of
these GEMs was simultaneously applied and evaluated unaltered
on the Japan (BL-Jap) and Europe (BL-Den) sets. We further examined whether the GEM scores were correlated or overlapped
with the information from conventional clinical parameters of
patients. Using a univariate analysis of rank-based correlation
on the BL-Jap cohort, we found that the GEM for MVAC response
was independent of available clinical parameters such as tumor
stage, grade, age, or gender (Spearman correlation = -0.14 to
0.07). We also found the GEM score to be the only significant
predictor of MVAC response on this cohort by a multivariate
analysis that was done together with the GEM score and the
above clinical and tumor pathologic variables (P = 0.03, logistic
regression GEM; Table 3; ref. 14). The BL-Den study was not large
enough for a multivariate analysis.
Ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer, the unaltered carboplatin
GEM also showed consistently significant results for patient response to pharmacotherapy in the OV-NC study (P = 0.034) and
for absolute patient survival in the OV-GA study (P = 0.047; Table 2).

In the OV-GA study, patients received carboplatin and Taxol (paclitaxel) and a large proportion of patients in the OV-NC study were
also reported to receive Taxol. We thus tested the ability of GEM
prediction for this drug to stratify the outcome in the two ovarian
studies. The scores of the Taxol GEM, in fact, correlated well with
the clinical response in the OV-NC study (P = 0.003) and with absolute patient survival in the OV-GA (P = 0.025) study. When the
carboplatin and Taxol combination GEM was applied, the differences in GEM scores between responders and nonresponders in
OV-NC were highly significant (P = 0.007). Moreover, the same
combination GEM significantly segregated scores between patients who survived and deceased patients in the OV-GA study
(P = 0.008). This combination GEM provided sensitivity of 77%,
specificity of 56%, positive predictive value of 71%, and negative
predictive value of 78% for the OV-NC cohort at the Youden cutoff
value; the overall ROC curve was also extremely significant (P <

www.aacrjournals.org

0.001; Supplementary Fig. S1). Together, results in ovarian cancer
also showed that the identical GEMs of individual agents and the
combination were successful in stratifying not only the measured
tumor response in the OV-NC study but also absolute patient survival (survivor versus deceased) in the OV-GA study. In the OV-NC
study, for which other clinical parameters were available, the carboplatin and Taxol combination GEM score was found to be independent of other clinical and pathologic variables such as tumor
grade and stage (Spearman correlation = −0.15 and 0.04) and the
only significant predictor of tumor response to pharmacotherapy
(P = 0.022, logistic regression GEM; Table 3).
Breast cancer. The response to pharmacotherapy of patients in
the neoadjuvant BR-TX breast cancer study and survival of patients entered on the adjuvant BR-Tai breast cancer study also correlated to our GEM scores (Table 2). For example, the identical
single-drug GEMs for Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide were

consistently different in tumor response to pharmacotherapy in
the BR-TX study (P = 0.019 and 0.064, two-sample t test) and in
absolute patient survival in the BR-Tai study (P = 0.002 and
0.052). The GEM of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was significantly different
only in BR-Tai (P = 0.024). Nevertheless, the combination prediction model based on the three single-drug GEMs of 5-FU, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC)—compounds
used in both studies—was significantly associated with patient
chemotherapeutic responses in BR-TX (P = 0.021) and survival status in BR-Tai (P = 0.033). This combination GEM provided sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 53%, positive predictive value of 32%,
and negative predictive value of 85% at the Youden cutoff value;
the overall ROC curve was highly significant (P = 0.007; Supplementary Fig. S1). For the neoadjuvant BR-Ger breast cancer study, all
the single-drug GEMs of gemcitabine, epirubicin, and docetaxel
(P = 0.014, 0.055, and 0.044) and the combination prediction model
based on the three single-drug GEMs were significantly different
between responders and nonresponders to pharmacotherapy
(P = 0.003; Table 2). In the BR-TX study, the only breast cancer trial
with both patients' chemotherapeutic response and other clinical
variable information, the GEM for Taxol and FAC response was
independent from other clinical and pathologic parameters (Spearman correlation = −0.07 and 0.13). We also compared our GEM
scores with a previously published nomogram prediction of chemotherapeutic response based on the clinical characteristics of
the patient and tumor (13). We found that the Taxol GEM scores
are weakly correlated with the nomogram (Pearson correlation = 0.24)
and the FAC GEM scores are not correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.07).
In multivariate prediction modeling, both estrogen receptor status
and GEM score were found to be significant predictors of tumor response in this cohort, implying potentially improved predictability
by combining GEM and clinical parameter information (P < 0.001
and P = 0.032, logistic regression GEM; Table 3).
Utility of GEM scores in stratifying actuarial patient survival. Unaltered GEMs evaluated above were then examined for

their ability to stratify actuarial patient survival. Using the selected
score cutoffs for the combination GEMs, patient survival time was
stratified in the Kaplan-Meier analysis for all five studies with patient survival time information across the three tumor types. With
the stratification by the combination GEM of MVAC in bladder
cancer, the 3-year overall survival rates were 81% for predicted responders compared with 33% for predicted nonresponders on the
BL-Jap study (P = 0.002, log-rank test) and 61% versus 16% on the
BL-Den study (P = 0.015; Fig. 2A). In ovarian cancer, the combination GEM of carboplatin and Taxol also effectively stratified patient
survival time in both OV-NC (P = 0.008, log-rank test) and OV-GA (P =
0.028) studies (Fig. 2B). In this analysis, patient stratification by the
GEM scores provided a difference in 3-year overall survival of 68%
versus 43% in OV-NC and >95% versus 23% in OV-GA. In breast
cancer, based on the combination GEM of FAC, we performed the
Kaplan-Meier analysis on the BR-Tai study, the only breast cancer
set with patient survival time information. This GEM stratification
was also significant (P = 0.05) with the 5-year overall survival rates
∼100% versus 74% between the predicted responders and the predicted nonresponders (Fig. 2C).
Predictive performance of in vitro COXEN-based compared
with classic GEMs. An important advantage of COXEN-based chemosensitivity prediction is efficient development of GEMs for any
single drug or combination with observed effects on cell lines
in vitro. However, an important question is whether this technique
sacrifices predictive performance compared with classic patient
sample-trained GEMs that may reflect in vivo activities and/or synergistic effects of certain compounds. We thus compared whether
COXEN-derived GEMs were equally effective as previous GEMs developed using a training microarray set from human patients with
known clinical responses to the drug(s). For example, in the BL-Jap
study, the original authors reported a 14-gene signature GEM,
which we call the Takata-GEM, predictive of patients' response
to MVAC combination chemotherapy (15). This Takata-GEM was
developed from the initial set of 18 patients and evaluated on

an additional set of 27 patients (total of 45) from the same center.
We compared the performance of the COXEN-based MVAC
combination GEM, COXEN-GEM, to Takata-GEM for patients'
disease-free survival time stratification. Both GEMs were first
evaluated with both the test subset of BL-Jap (n = 27) and the
whole BL-Jap cohort (n = 45). Finally, both GEMs were evaluated
for their predictive ability on a third independent set, BL-Den
(16). COXEN-GEM was found to be an effective predictor of patient outcome in the whole BL-Jap set (Fig. 3A, top) as well as its
test subset (Fig. 3A, bottom). Takata-GEM was certainly able to
stratify patients' outcomes well when applied to the whole BLJap cohort (Fig. 3B, top). However, when this model was used
to predict the test subset independent from its GEM training,
its statistical significance became considerably weaker (P =
0.078; Fig. 3B, bottom). When applied to the independent BLDen set, the COXEN-GEM retained its prediction performance
(Fig. 3C), whereas the Takata-GEM was unable to stratify the patient outcome in this independent cohort (Fig. 3D).

Discussion
The conceptual framework and the high potential of in vitro
drug activity-based GEMs for predicting patient response to chemotherapy has been laid out in previous studies (6). In this study,
we showed two major breakthroughs in GEM-based prediction for
patients' chemotherapeutic responses: (a) concordant prediction
performance of unaltered in vitro–based GEMs on geographically
and ethnically diverse cancer patient cohorts in three different
cancer types and (b) simultaneous use of multiple, parallel historical patient data sets for efficient GEM assessment. Together, we
believe these provided a highly encouraging possibility in applying
such in vitro–based GEMs to guide patients with more effective
chemotherapies.
Some recent GEMs initially reported with their superior prediction performance failed to perform well by an independent
group's validation (11). This may be due to the so-called “selection bias” when such multigene predictors were trained with both
modeling and applying microarray data sets of numerous candidate

Figure 3. Comparison of predictive performance of COXEN-based GEMs to conventional patient data-derived GEMs. Patient disease-free survival (DFS) or overall
survival (OS) prediction was done by either the COXEN-derived GEM stratification of MVAC (COXEN-GEM) used in Fig. 2A or that using conventional human
patient-based approach (Takata-GEM; ref. 4). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis by (A) COXEN-GEM on the whole BL-Jap set (n = 45), (B) COXEN-GEM on the test
subset of BL-Jap (n = 27), (C) Takata-GEM on the whole BL-Jap set (n = 45), (D) Takata-GEM on the test subset of BL-Jap (n = 27), (E) COXEN-GEM on the BL-Den set
(n = 14), and (F) Takata-GEM on the BL-Den set (n = 14). P values (log-rank test).

genes. Our current study has avoided this pitfall by independently testing multiple geographically and ethnically diverse patient sets and by consistently predicting both clinical tumor
response and patient survival outcome of 477 patients across
three different cancer types. Therefore, we believe the prediction
performance of the in vitro–based GEMs here will be highly likely
realized in clinical practice, although the statistical power of some
of these GEMs may appear to be a bit lower than those reported
in other recent studies applied only to a single patient set at
a time (17).
We found that the GEM score was independent of conventional
clinical parameters and was always a significant predictor of tumor
response to pharmacotherapy even when all other clinical variables were considered together, suggesting that the GEMs are
not simply surrogates of standard tumor characteristic variables.
Also, GEMs generated by various different training sets that
contained distinct stages of bladder cancer successfully stratified
patient survival with only a slight decrease in statistical significance, whereas the accuracy to distinguish the ability to responders from nonresponders was maintained (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Although the assumption of independence of relevant agents was
necessary due to our GEM derivation from the single-agent drug ac-

tivity data of NCI-60, our GEM scores correlated well with clinical
responses and survival of diverse patient cohorts of the three cancer types treated with multiagent pharmacotherapy in this study.
This showed that although our combination GEMs could not capture synergistic drug effects, the main efficacy of combination regimens appeared to be reflected by simple additive effects of
single-drug GEMs. It is conceivable that future in vitro work on
doublet or higher-order drug combinations may help in modifying
the algorithm to effectively incorporate drug synergies (18).
We, however, note that each GEM's reported sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, or KaplanMeier curves here (derived from its ROC curve) showed its optimal
performance on the applying particular data set. This does not yet
represent validation of each drug GEM's preset threshold to call a
patient case + (responder) or - (nonresponder) but rather shows
proof-of-concept, illustrating that such GEM scores are informative
in stratifying patients' responses to the agent. To derive an exact
cutoff criterion on a specific GEM assay for clinical use, a standard
diagnosis assay platform and procedure should be developed for
routine clinical practice, from which a fixed cutoff value can be
defined for a target patient population, which, we believe, is quite
feasible in the near future.

Genomic Prediction of Combination Chemotherapy Response

Generating GEMs using in vitro–based approaches does also
have some theoretical and practical limitations. For example, it
cannot be used to develop GEMs for agents that do not have
any effect on cell lines in vitro. Although this requirement is strictly
embedded in the design of the approach, the composition of the
cell panel may be tailored to the expected cellular and molecular
target of the tested agent. For example, although using the NCI-60
panel may not result in an effective generation of a drug response
profile for an antiangiogenic agent that targets endothelial cells,
carrying out such an experiment on an endothelial cell panel
may provide the necessary data that can be used for GEM development. Similarly, for agents that target the immune system, panels composed of the appropriate cells may permit GEM
development. As we have shown above, the critical requirement
for the cell panel is to provide effective dose-response information
for the agent in question rather than be required to be composed
of the same histologic tumor types as the human tumors whose
response to therapy is assessed. Hence, using an endothelial cell
