ABSTRACT
We previously found that BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3)
was highly expressed in tumorigenic rat glioma cells. However, the functional role of
BRCC3 in human glioma cells remains to be characterized. This study indicated that the
upregulation of BRCC3 expression was induced in two human malignant glioblastoma
U251 and A172 cell lines following exposure to the alkylating agent, temozolomide
(TMZ). Homologous recombination (HR)-dependent DNA repair-associated genes
(i.e. BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and FANCD2) were also increased in U251 and A172 cells
after treatment with TMZ. BRCC3 gene knockdown through lentivirus-mediated gene
knockdown approach not only significantly reduced the clonogenic and migratory
abilities of U251 and A172 cells, but also enhanced their sensitization to TMZ. The
increase in phosphorylated H2AX foci (γH2AX) formation, an indicator of DNA damage,
persisted in TMZ-treated glioma cells with stable knockdown BRCC3 expression,
suggesting that BRCC3 gene deficiency is associated with DNA repair impairment. In
summary, we demonstrate that by inducing DNA repair, BRCC3 renders glioma cells
resistant to TMZ. The findings point to BRCC3 as a potential target for treatment of
alkylating drug-resistant glioma.

TMZ is an alkylating agent and converted by nonenzymatic reaction in the systemic circulation at the
physiological pH to the reactive compound, 3-methyl(triazen-1-yl)-imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). This
agent induces the methylation of the O6 position on guanine
which is mispaired with thymine to form O6MeG-T
mismatch in double strand DNA, leading to cell death by
blocking DNA replication. It is well-known that TMZresistance could be mediated by the action of O6-methyl
guanine methyltransferase (MGMT) which repairs
TMZ-induced DNA lesions via removal of O6-methyl
group [10]. The components involved in mismatch repair
(MMR) such as MLH1 and PMS2 are also involved in
TMZ resistance in glioblastoma [11]. Additionally, the three
essential molecules for HR-dependent DNA repair pathway
in mammalian cells, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51,
have been reported to contribute to cellular resistance to
alkylating agents [12–15].

INTRODUCTION
Astrocytoma WHO grade IV, also named
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and
aggressive form of brain tumors [1–4]. Current treatments
for gliomas include radical surgical resection, standard
radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Clinical reports
have indicated that temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy
in combination with radiotherapy is able to increase the
survival period for GBM patients [5–7]. TMZ therapy
alone is also a promising therapeutic for elderly patients
with GBMs due to its survival benefit with low toxicity.
Therefore, TMZ is used as the current first-line therapeutic
agent for gliomas [8, 9]. Nevertheless, the median survival
of GBM patients remains less than 2 years, with few
surviving more than 5 years [6]. To gain more effective
therapeutics, the molecular strategy to promote the action
of anti-glioma drugs needs to be developed.

BRCC3 (previously known as BRCC36) is one of
the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) in humans and is
encoded in the BRCC3 gene located at the Xq28 locus.
It is classified as a member of the JAMM/MPN+ family
of zinc metalloproteases that specifically cleaves Lys63linked polyubiquitin chains [16–19]. BRCC3 is known
to serve as a component of the BRCA complex involved
in TRF2-dependent telomere protection, which maintains
genomic stability under physiological condition [20]. The
BRCA complex contains multi-proteins, such as BRCA1,
BRCA2, BARD1, RAD51 and RAP80, which regulate
diverse processes important for the cellular response to
DNA damage [19, 21, 22]. This complex specifically
recognizes ‘Lys63’-linked ubiquitinated histone H2A and
phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) at DNA lesions sites and
facilitates the recruitment of other DNA repair proteins to
DNA damaged sites for DNA repair [21–23]. The BRCA
complex forms and accumulates at DNA damage sites
in response to DNA damage induced by radiation and/or
alkylating agents [13, 24–26]. The study has demonstrated
that BRCC3 depletion prevents the formation of BRCA1
nuclear foci, and subsequently impairs the DNA repair
pathway in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation
in breast cancer cells, suggesting that BRCC3 is referred
as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer [27].
Nevertheless, the role of BRCC3 in glioma cells remains
elusive.
In this study, we investigated the biological function
of BRCC3 in two human malignant glioma (MG) cell
lines, U251 and A172 cells that expressed a high level
of BRCC3 mRNA and exhibited resistance to TMZ. In
addition, treatment with TMZ induced the upregulation
of HR-dependent DNA repair genes in U251 and A172
cells, as well as the activation of DNA repair process. To
gain insights into the functional role of BRCC3 in glioma
cells, we examined glioma cell growth by inhibition of
BRCC3 expression in U251 and A172 cells. Our findings
provide the important evidence showing that targeting
BRCC3 expression can impair DNA repair in U251 and
A172 cells and increases sensitization of the glioma cells
to the alkylating drugs.

immunohistochemistry indicated that tumor cells in
grade I-III astrocytoma and grade IV GBM displayed a
strong BRCC3 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B-E, arrows),
whereas BRCC3 staining was weak in normal brain
tissues (Fig. 1A, arrows). Through the analysis of oneway ANOVA, we found that BRCC3 immunoreactivity
score (IRS) was significantly correlated to various grades
of glioma (F = 6.0647, p = 0.00295). Moreover, the IRS of
BRCC3 in grade IV GBM tissues was higher than normal
cortical tissues (Fig. 1F), indicating that the high level of
BRCC3 expression is associated with tumor cell growth
during glioma progression.
We then performed in vitro study using the three
malignant glioblastoma cell lines including U87, U251
and A172 cells. When compared to U87 cells, U251 and
A172 cells were more resistant to alkylating agent TMZ
(Supporting information Fig. 1A). U251 and A172 cells
were also less susceptible to another alkylating agent,
BCNU (Supporting information Fig. 1B). Given the fact
that BRCC3 is a component of BRCA complex involved
in HR-dependent DNA repair for DNA damage [27, 29],
BRCC3 mRNA expression in these three glioma cell
lines was examined. The results from QPCR analysis
showed that U251 and A172 cells expressed higher level
of BRCC3 mRNA than U87 cells (Fig. 2A). Exposure
to TMZ for 48 h resulted in the upregulation of BRCC3
mRNA expression in U251 and A172 cells (Fig. 2B). Yet,
treatment with TMZ caused only a slight upregulation of
BRCC3 mRNA expression in U87 cells (Fig. 2B). We
also noticed that an increase in BRCC3 mRNA expression
was detected in U251 and A172 cells after exposure to
BCNU (Supporting information Fig. 1C). Through the
examination of the subcellular localization of BRCC3
in U87, U251 and A172 cells, BRCC3 was found in
the nucleus of U251 and A172 cells after exposure to
TMZ for 48 h (Fig. 2D-E, arrows). BRCC3 was rarely
detected in the nucleus of TMZ-treated U87 cells (Fig. 2C,
arrows). However, in the absence of TMZ, BRCC3 was
predominantly located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C-E,
arrowheads). The results suggest that BRCC3 is involved
in the cellular resistance to alkylating drug-induced
cytotoxicity.

Through our previous study in genome-wide cDNA
expression profiling on tumorigenic C6 glioma cells
[28], we found that tumorigenic C6 glioma cells showed
abundant amount of BRCC3 (Supporting information
Table 1). To determine the functional role of BRCC3
in glioma cells, we first examined the expression of
BRCC3 in human glioma tissues. We used the glioma
tissue arrays containing tumor sections from human
patients with different glioma grades. The results from

We were next to examining expression of genes
that involved in HR-dependent DNA repair, i.e. BRCA1,
BRCA2, RAD51, and FANCD2 [13, 15, 30–32]. As shown
in Fig. 3A, the expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and
FANCD2 was remarkably increased in U251 and A172 cells
at 48 h after treatment with TMZ. Although the expression
of BRCA1 in U87 cells was increased in response to TMZ
exposure, the change in the expression of the other three
DNA repair genes in U87 cells was insignificant. Given

the fact that treatment with TMZ promoted the formation
of γH2AX foci to provoke the activation of the DNA
repair process [33], immunofluorescence was conducted
to examine the levels of γH2AX foci in these three cell
lines following TMZ. As shown in Fig. 3B, γH2AX foci
formation was increased time-dependently in the three cell
lines after exposure to TMZ (6, 12, 24 and 48 h). Yet, the
intensity of γH2AX foci in A172 cells declined at 72 h after
TMZ treatment, whereas the levels of γH2AX foci in U251
cells were also reduced at 96 h post TMZ exposure. The
more effective DNA repair occurs in A172 and U251 than
U87 cells, suggesting that an increase of DNA repair genes

(BRCC3-KD1), or lenti-sh-hBRCC3-2 (BRCC3-KD2).
The morphological examination showed that the inhibition
of BRCC3 expression induced the elongation of these
glioma cell processes (Fig. 4A, arrows). Through QPCR
(Fig. 4B) and western blot analysis (Fig. 4C), we found
that BRCC3-KD1 and BRCC3-KD2 suppressed the
production of BRCC3 mRNA and protein production
efficiently in U251 and A172 cells.
Further results indicated that the ablation of
BRCC3 gene expression effectively reduced the growth
rate of U251 and A172 cells (Fig. 5A), and suppressed
their clonogenic ability (Fig. 5B). The cell scratch assay
indicated that BRCC3 gene knockdown caused a decline
in the migration of U251 and A172 cells (Fig. 6A). The
cell invasion of the two cell lines was also diminished
by the inhibition of BRCC3 expression (Fig.6B). These
results further confirm that BRCC3 is essential for the
regulation of glioma cell growth, migration, and invasion.

cells [27]. Accordingly, we examined if the depletion of
BRCC3 promotes TMZ-induced cytotoxicity in U251
and A172 cells. Our data showed that BRCC3 gene
knockdown reduced the cell viability of TMZ-treated
U251 and A172 cells when compared to the relative
TMZ-treated mock cells (Fig. 7A). Moreover, the colony
formation of U251 and A172 cells with BRCC3-KD1
and BRCC3-KD2 was decreased in the presence of TMZ
compared to TMZ-treated mock (Fig. 7B). Moreover,
BRCC3 gene knockdown promoted the cell death of
U251 and A172 cells in response to BCNU (Supporting
information Fig. 1D). These observations demonstrate that
the downregulation of BRCC3 expression increases the
sensitization of U251 and A172 cells to alkylating drugmediated cytotoxicity.
In addition, the deficiency of BRCC3 gene
expression reduced the levels of DNA repair-associated
genes (i.e. BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and FANCD2) in
TMZ-treated U251 and A172 cells, when compared to
those detected in TMZ-treated mock cells (Fig. 8A). In
contrast, the intensity of γH2AX foci in U251 and A172
cells with BRCC3 inhibition remained at higher levels
in the presence of TMZ for 48 – 96 h, when compared
to TMZ-treated mock cells (Fig. 8B). Moreover, the
formation of γH2AX foci expression persisted higher at

lines is upregulated in response to TMZ or BCNU. These
observations demonstrate that upregulation of BRCC3
expression is the general response of resistant glioma cells
to alkylating agents.
Here, we address that BRCC3 exists evidently in the
nuclei of U251 and A172 cells after exposure to TMZ, but
lesser in U87 cells. Although an increase in the formation
of γH2AX foci is induced in the three glioma cell lines
after exposure to TMZ, faster decline in the formation of
γH2AX foci is observed in U251 and A172 cells rather
than U87 cells. This reveals that the activation of DNA
repair in U251 and A172 cells is effective. Given the fact
that BRCC3 (BRCC36) is essential for the protection of
breast cancer cells from ionizing radiation-induced DNA
damage [27], a high level of BRCC3 could protect U251
and A172 cells from TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. The
proapoptotic effector Bak and antiapoptotic BCL-2 family
member Mcl-1 have been reported to participate in TMZinduced apoptosis of U251 cells [36]. The action of Mcl1/Bak axis on TMZ-induced cell death of BRCC3-KD
glioma cells is not yet known. In addition, it is possible
that BRCC3 effect could combine with other factors
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with TMZ resistance in glioblastoma, such as
EFEMP1 (Fibulin-3), an extracellular matrix protein [37].
BRCA-triggered DNA repair pathway contains
multiple proteins including BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1,
BRCC3 (BRCC36), BRCC45, and RAD51 [19, 27, 38].
Our study presents that BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 are
increased in the two glioma cell lines following treatment
with TMZ. BRCC3 has been reported to interact with
BRCA1 directly to trigger BRCA-associated DNA repair
pathway [27]. In addition, BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51
are required for HR-dependent DNA repair pathway in
TMZ-resistant glioma [12–14]. Thus, an increase in the
expression of BRCC3 together with these DNA repairassociated genes following TMZ promotes effective
HR-directed DNA repair, which in turn contributes to
cellular resistance of U251 and A172 cells to TMZ-induced
cytotoxicity. U87 cells, however, may execute insufficient
DNA repair mechanism, since only BRCA1 mRNA
expression is increased in TMZ-treated U87 cells.
The defect of the FA repair pathway was originally
identified in a rare genetic disease, Fanconi Anemia (FA),
with several abnormal features including chromosomal

instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents
such as mitomycin C [39–41]. FANCD2, a critical FA
protein, interacts with BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 at the
site of DNA damage to facilitate DNA repair [39, 40, 42].
Previous findings have shown that downregulation of
FANCD2 expression by siRNA-mediated approach in U87
and T98MG cells can increase cellular sensitivity to glioma
chemotherapeutic agents, TMZ and BCNU, demonstrating
that FA repair pathway is involved in glioma resistance to
DNA alkylating agents [43]. Our results indicate that
exposure to TMZ causes a profound expression of
FA/BRCA DNA repair genes in U251 and A172 cells when
compared to U87 cells. Since U251 and A172 cells express
a higher level of BRCC3 than U87 cells either with or
without TMZ treatment, it suggests that FA cooperated with
BRCA-DNA repair pathways could be highly activated in
U251 and A172 cells.
A growing body of evidence indicates that the
inhibition of DNA repair gene expression in cancer cells
in combination with radiation and/or anti-tumor drugs is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a positive therapeutic strategy [19, 25, 29, 44, 45]. For
instance, targeting RAD51-dependent repair together
with ionizing radiation and TMZ has been reported to
be an effective therapeutic strategy for glioma [12].
Interruption of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression or their
function is also found to enhance radiosensitivity and the
chemotherapeutic effectiveness of tumor cells [19, 26,
45–47]. Moreover, the knockdown of BRCC3 (BRCC36)
in cooperation with ionizing radiation can increase breast
tumor cells undergoing apoptosis [27]. Here, to elucidate
the functional role of BRCC3 in DNA repair pathway
induced by TMZ, we have generated the glioma cell lines
with stable BRCC3 gene knockdown. The inhibition of
BRCC3 gene expression significantly reduces the cell
viability and clonogenicity of U251 and A172 cells by
TMZ treatment, indicating that BRCC3 can be treated
as the target in order to enhance the sensitivity of glioma
cells to TMZ. Moreover, BRCC3 is a direct regulator of
BRCA1 activation induced by ionizing radiation [27].
This molecule is required for the recruitment of BRCA1

and other DNA repair proteins to DNA damage sites [44].
The expression level of genes associated with DNA repair
in TMZ-treated U251 and A172 cells with BRCC3 gene
knockdown is much lower than that detected in TMZtreated mock cells. In addition, higher levels of γH2AX
foci in U251 and A172 cells with inhibition of BRCC3
gene expression persist at a later time point following
TMZ exposure when compared to that observed in
TMZ-treated mock cells. Thus, the inhibition of BRCC3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression may impair DNA repair mechanism in U251
and A172 cells, which can promotes sensitization of the
two glioma cell lines to TMZ. Given that the formation
of γH2AX foci is correlated to cell senescence [48], we
have also examined if the inhibition of BRCC3 gene
expression could lead to glioma cell senescence. Through
immunostaining of senescence associated β-galactosidase
(β-Gal), rare β-Gal+ cells were observed in mock or
BRCC3-KD U251 and A172 cultures (data not shown).

We also noticed that the inhibition of BRCC3 sensitizes
U251 and A172 cells to BCNU-induced cell toxicity. This
supports our view that BRCC3 upregulation is common
response to protect glioma cells against alkylating agentinduced DNA damage.
Previous report has demonstrated that abrogation of
BRCC3 (BRCC36) using small interfering RNAs targeting
BRCC36 causes no significant effect on the cell apoptosis
of human breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that the
downregulation of BRCC3 expression is not lethal [27].
In contrast, we show here that the lentivirus-mediated
knockdown of BRCC3 can induce the morphological
change in U251 and A172 cells. Moreover, the depletion
of BRCC3 gene expression decreases the cell growth
and clonogenic ability of U251 and A172 cells. The
cell migration and invasion of U251 and A172 cells are
also impaired by BRCC3 knockdown. However, similar
levels of γH2AX foci formation are observed in mock
and BRCC3-KD glioma cells in the absence of TMZ,
indicating no serious DNA damage in BRCC3-KD cells
without TMZ. Moreover, we found no significant change
in the expression of genes associated DNA repair in mock
and BRCC3-KD glioma cells without TMZ treatment
(data no shown). These observations reveal that BRCC3
is involved in glioma cell growth even if no alkylating
agent-induced DNA damage. Besides of involving in
DNA repair, BRCC3 is one of the four-member DUBs
to form BRISC (Brcc36-containing isopeptide complex)
in the cytosol, which selectively cleaves Lys63-linked
polyubiquitin [49, 50]. Recently, BRCC3 in the cytosol
has been reported to promote the inflammasome activation
by deubiquitinating NLRP3 in LPS-primed macrophages
[51]. Notably, BRCC3 is predominantly observed in the
cytoplasm of glioma cells without TMZ treatment. Thus,
it remains to be further dissected if the DUB activity of
cytosolic BRCC3 manipulates glioma cell growth in the
absence of alkylating agents.
In summary, BRCC3 is involved in the regulation of
cell growth and TMZ resistance in glioma cells. Given the
findings that HR-DNA repair proteins (BRCA1, BRCA2
and RAD51) are significantly increased in TMZ-resistant
glioma cells, an abundance expression of BRCC3 in
glioma cells seems likely to foster HR-dependent DNA
repair processes. Thus, effectively inhibiting BRCC3
expression in order to cause an insufficiency of homologydirected repair in glioma cells is a potential therapeutic
strategy for sensitizing glioma tumor cells to the alkylating
anti-tumor drugs.

Cell Culture
Human malignant glioma U87 cell line was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville,
Maryland, USA). U251 and A172 cells were provided
from Dr. Pei-Jung Lu (Institute of Clinical Medicine,
National Cheng Kung University). The human glioma
cell lines were grown in DMEM containing antibiotics
and 10% FBS.

Lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting BRCC3
The shRNA lentiviral particles against human
BRCC3 expression in human MG cell lines were
designed by Biosettia Inc (San Diego, CA, USA). The
lentivirus vector constructs used in this study included
pLV-mU6-[sh-scramble] EF1a-GFP-puromycin (lentish-ctrl), pLV-mU6-[sh-hBRCC3] EF1a-GFP-puromycin
(lenti-sh-hBRCC3_265 and lenti-sh-BRCC3_731). Gene
transduction and preparation of transfectants were performed
as described previously [52]. Briefly, U251 and A172
cells at a density of 3×105 cells per dish were seeded
onto 60-mm dishes for 24 h. The cultures were infected
by 300 μl of lentiviral particles (lenti-sh-ctrl and lentish-hBRCC3) in 3 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS, and
then incubated for 24 h in 5% of CO2 at 37°C. The medium
was then replaced by DMEM containing 10% FBS for
24 h. The cultures were subsequently treated using 3 μg/ml
puromycin in the presence of 10% FBS in DMEM for 48 h
to generate stable transfectants. Cultures transduced with
lenti-sh-ctrl were used as the control group (mock). The
mock cells and the cells infected by lenti-sh-hBRCC3_265
(BRCC3-KD1) and lenti-sh-BRCC3_731 (BRCC3-KD2)
were subjected to QPCR and western blot analysis to

MTT cell proliferation assay

Colony formation assay

Cell growth was determined using the MTT
colorimetric assay. Cells were seeded at a density of
5×103 - 3×104 per well onto 96- or 24-well plates supplied
with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cultures were
treated with 200 μM of TMZ or 100 μM of BCNU in
DMEM containing 1% FBS for the distinct time periods.
0.2% DMSO was used as vehicle. After that, MTT
solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well for 4 h, and
the purple formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO
solution. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm using an
ELISA-plated reader.

Colony formation assay was performed by replating
cells at a density of 200 cells per well onto a 6-well culture
plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 14 days, the
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min
and then stained by using 0.05% crystal violet in ddH2O
for 15 min. Alternatively, for examination of clonogenic
ability of glioma cells with TMZ treatment, a density of
1000 cells per well were seeded onto a 6-well culture plate
and 200 μM of TMZ or vehicle in DMEM containing 10%
FBS was added to the cultures at 3 day after seeding. The
cultures were continuously maintained for another 7 days
and subjected to the colony formation assay. Colonies
produced by each cell-group were counted and measured
using ImageJ software.

Cell scratch assay
A monolayer scratch assay was performed as
previously described [52]. After mechanically scratch
with a pipette tip, cells were rinsed with PBS and grown in
DMEM without serum for various time periods. The cell
motility was analyzed by measurement of wound closure
area using ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, NIMH,
Bethesda, MD; http://rsbweb.nih.gov).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Quantitative-PCR (QPCR) Light Cycler Fast
Start DNA Master SYBR Green used in this study was
purchased from Roche Diagnostics (USA). Total RNA
isolation, PCR, and data normalization were performed as
described previously [52, 53], with minor modifications.
PCR reactants were also analyzed on 1% agarose gels to
verify primer specificity. The specific primer sequences
for the genes were designed using NCBI software PrimerBLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The
oligonucleotides were synthesized in MWG Biotech AG
(Table 1).

In vitro transwell cell invasion assay
24-well format 8.0-μm pore size transwell inserts
were used to analyze the cell invasion. Cells were
seeded at the density of 2×104 cells per well onto PDLcoated transwell inserts which were placed in the culture
wells with DMEM containing 10% FBS in the lower
compartment of each well. After 6 h, the inserts were
removed from the culture wells and then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The inserts were stained
with 0.05% crystal violet in ddH2O for 10 min and the
upper surface of the insert was gently cleansed with cotton
swabs. The cells that migrated through the filter membrane
toward the other side of the inserts were counted using
ImageJ software. The results are represented as the

Western blot analysis
Total proteins were extracted from the cells using
PBS containing 1% NP40, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% SDS,
1 mM PMSF and iced proteinase inhibitor cocktail. After
centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant
was collected and protein concentration was determined
using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad
