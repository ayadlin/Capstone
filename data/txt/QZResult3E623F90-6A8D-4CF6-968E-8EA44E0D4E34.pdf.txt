BACKGROUND. Rituximab in sequential combination with fludarabine (Flu)
allowed patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) to achieve
higher remission rates and longer response duration. Based on their recent experience in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in this study, the authors attempted
to demonstrate whether consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab could
prolong the response duration in this patient population.

METHODS. This Phase II study was based on a consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab for patients in complete remission (CR) or partial remission
(PR) who were positive for minimal residual disease (MRD), as determined by
flow cytometry. Seventy-five symptomatic, untreated patients with B-CLL
received 6 monthly cycles of Flu (25 mg/m2 for 5 days) followed by 4 weekly
doses of rituximab (375 mg/m2). Then, 28 patients who were positive for MRD
were consolidated with 4 monthly cycles of rituximab (375 mg/m2) followed by

RESULTS. Based on National Cancer Institute criteria, 61 of 75 patients (81%)
either no response or disease progression. MRD-positive patients in CR or PR
who received consolidation therapy (n 5 28 patients) had a significantly longer
response duration (87% vs 32% at 5 years; P 5 .001) compared with a subset of
patients who did not receive consolidation therapy (n 5 18 patients). All patients
experienced a long progression-free survival from the end of induction treatment
(73% at 5 years). It was noteworthy that, within the subset of ZAP-70-positive
patients, MRD-positive, consolidated patients (n 5 12 patients) had a significantly longer response duration (69% vs 0% at 2.6 years; P 5 .007) compared with
MRD-positive, unconsolidated patients (n 5 11 patients).

with rituximab prolonged response duration significantly in patients with MRDpositive B-CLL. Cancer 2008;112:119–28.  2007 American Cancer Society.

hronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form
of leukemia in the Western world, and it affects mainly elderly
individuals. Patients with CLL have variable outcomes, and survival
ranges from months to decades.1,2
Promising results were observed when fludarabine was introduced for patients who were treated with alkylator agents and
for those with symptomatic, untreated CLL.3,4 However, despite
response rates as high as 70%, complete remissions (CR) were

infrequent, and the longer progression-free survival
(PFS) in the fludarabine arm from 3 randomized studies5–7 did not produce significantly improved overall
survival (OS).
Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody
directed against the cell-surface antigen CD20, which
is active in low-grade and diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).8,9 Moreover, experimental data
indicate a potential additive effect of combining rituximab with fludarabine because of enhanced sensitivity
of tumor cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.10
Three Phase II studies combining rituximab with fludarabine have achieved a much higher CR rate than
the rate reported previously with any other therapeutic approach in CLL.11–13 Although to our knowledge
there is no proof to date of an improvement in OS,
disease-free progression has been prolonged. Significantly, not only has the CR rate increased dramatically, but it also has proved possible to eradicate
minimal residual disease (MRD) in an increasing proportion of patients. In 224 patients with untreated
CLL who received combined fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, Keating et al.14 demonstrated
that flow cytometry-negative or minimally positive
bone marrow (BM) at the completion of therapy was
correlated with improved OS. Therefore, studies using
MRD assays by 4-color flow cytometry or molecular
methods may be better for confirming a true CR,
which should be the major therapeutic objective to
improve PFS and OS in patients with CLL. Recently,
the eradication of detectable MRD by 4-color flow
cytometry with the combination of alemtuzumab and
fludarabine was associated with improved OS and
treatment-free survival.15
In addition, it has been demonstrated that rituximab maintenance therapy provides a significant PFS
benefit in patients with indolent B-cell NHL.16,17
Therefore, the drug potentially may be useful as
maintenance therapy in patients with indolent NHL
or CLL.18–21
Recent literature data indicate that unmutated
VH genes, CD38 or ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase
overexpression, and positive MRD status may predict
either a lower response, a shorter PFS, or a shorter
OS.22–27 In the current study, our objective was to
demonstrate that a consolidation and maintenance
therapy with rituximab administered to symptomatic,
untreated patients in clinical CR or partial remission
(PR) but with detectable MRD, as determined by flow
cytometry, may prolong PFS. Finally, we evaluated
the different clinical impact of relevant biologic features, such as ZAP-70, CD38, and immunoglobulin
heavy-chain variable-region (IgVH) status and cytogenetics, on response duration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From March 2000 to February 2005, 46 patients were
registered in this prospective Phase II study on consolidation/maintenance with rituximab. The study
was conducted in accordance to the Declaration of
Helsinki. The current analysis was performed in July
2006. All eligible patients provided written informed
consent and had received prior induction therapy for
CLL based on sequential combination of fludarabine
with rituximab, as described previously.13 Patients
were required to have histologically and immunophenotypically documented CLL, as defined by the
modified National Cancer Institute (NCI) 1996 guidelines.28 An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status from 0 to 2 was required.
Patients were excluded if they had active opportunistic infections, any other severe infection that was
not controlled by medical therapy, or major organ
dysfunction.

Cellular Immunophenotypic Analysis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed
for surface expression of CD19/CD5/CD38 and
CD19/CD5/CD23 by triple-color immunofluorescence, as described previously.24 ZAP-70 protein
determination was performed by flow cytometry, as
described elsewhere.24,25 Flow cytometric analysis
was performed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San
Jose, Calif), and CellQuest software was used to acquire and analyze data. The threshold of positivity
both for CD38 and for ZAP-70 was set at >20%
CD19-positive (CD191)/CD51 B cells.
MRD Flow Cytometric Study
Between 50,000 and 300,000 total cells were analyzed
in each test performed in BM approximately 1 to 2
months after the completion of induction therapy.
The antibodies used were anti-CD5-allophycocyanin,
anti-CD20-phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD19-peridinchlorophyll protein, anti-CD38-PE, anti-CD20-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Becton Dickinson),
and anti-CD79b-FITC (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom). The 2 combinations CD19/CD5/CD20/CD79b
and CD19/CD5/CD38/CD20 allowed us to discriminate B-CLL cells from normal B cells in all analyses,
as previously described.27 The threshold of positivity
was set at >1% CD191/CD51/CD79b-negative
(CD79b2) CLL cells.
Interphase Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
Separate hybridizations were performed for loci on
chromosomes 11, 12, 13, and 17. For chromosomes

disease [MRD] status) are detailed; CR indicates complete remission; PR, partial remission; pts, patients; BM, bone marrow; 1, positive; PB, peripheral blood;
2, negative. (B) Rituximab consolidation and maintenance scheme. Twenty-eight MRD-positive patients in clinical CR or PR underwent consolidation/maintenance therapy with 4 monthly cycles of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 followed by 12 monthly doses of rituximab at a dose of 150 mg/m2.

11 (q23), 13, and 17, commercial probes (ATM-2, Rb1, and p53, respectively) were used (Vysis Inc.,
London, United Kingdom). An a satellite DNA probe
CEP12, which was labeled directly with SpectrumGreen, was used to detect aneuploidy of chromosome 12. LSIp53 labeled with SpectrumOrange (Vysis
Inc.) was used to evaluate chromosome deletion at
17p13.1. The procedure used has been described previously.29

IgVH Mutation Analysis
Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed as
reported previously.30 The resulting combinational
DNAs, which were checked for first-strand synthesis,
were amplified by using a mixture of sense primers
annealing either to the VH1 through VH6 leader
sequences or to the 50 end of VH1 through VH6 FR1,
as reported.31,32 VH gene sequences that deviated
>2% from the corresponding germline gene were
defined as mutated. The procedure that we used was
described previously.13
Treatment Plan
For induction treatment, all patients received daily
fludarabine (25 mg/m2) delivered intravenously on
days 1 through 5 of 28-day intervals for a total of 6

cycles. Then, patients with stable disease or better,
as defined by the NCI criteria, received 4 weekly
doses of rituximab (375 mg/m2), as reported previously.13 Patients were observed for approximately 1
month and then were restaged completely to determine their overall response according to the NCI
1996 criteria.28 At this point, we performed a careful
immunophenotypic BM evaluation in which samples
with CD191/CD51/CD79b2 cells >1% were considered positive for MRD. Furthermore, we continued
monitoring the immunophenotype of the peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) every month for 1 year in
MRD BM-negative patients; and, when CD191/
CD51/CD79b2 (MRD) PBLs were >1000/mL, a new
BM immunophenotypic analysis was performed.
Based on this threshold in peripheral blood, all of
these patients also had MRD-positive BM (>1%).
Therefore, both of these patient subsets (n 5 28
patients), 1 subset (n 5 17 patients) in clinical CR or
PR who were MRD-positive after induction and
another subset (n 5 11 patients) in CR who were
MRD-negative after induction but who became
MRD-positive within 1 year, underwent consolidation/maintenance therapy with 4 monthly cycles of
rituximab at 375 mg/m2 followed by 12 monthly
doses of rituximab at 150 mg/m2 (Fig. 1A,B). In

detail, inclusion in the consolidation/maintenance
treatment group for each patient was determined
either immediately after induction in BM MRDpositive patients or soon after the detection of MRD
in BM in BM MRD-negative patients within 1 year.
Eighteen patients with clinical and biologic characteristics similar to those of the consolidation/maintenance group underwent observation only. The
complete outline of the study is provided in Figure 1A.

Assessment and Management of Toxicity During
Consolidation/Maintenance Treatment
Hematologic toxicity was graded according to the
modified NCI criteria for CLL,28 whereas nonhematologic toxicity was graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. Infusion toxicity was assessed
according to the criteria described previously by
Byrd et al.12 Patients who experienced grade 3 or
4 neutropenia were supported with growth factors
(granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor) and remained without treatment until this parameter
recovered within 50% of the baseline value. Thereafter, they received the same original dose. There
were no dose reductions for rituximab therapy
because of hematologic toxicity. At the onset of fever,
chills, rigors, or other infusional reactions, patients
had their infusion discontinued; and, after the resolution of symptoms, the rituximab infusion was
restarted at a rate of 50 mg per hour and then escalated as tolerated to 200 mg per hour. Patients who
developed an infection were observed without further CLL treatment until the infection had resolved,
but no dose reductions were implemented.

Patient Monitoring and Response Evaluation
Patients were assessed for induction response 4
weeks after the last rituximab infusion with a
detailed clinical and instrumental evaluation, as
reported previously.13 These same evaluations were
performed at the end of consolidation/maintenance
therapy. Criteria for response used the revised 1996
NCI Working Group guidelines.28 A CR or PR had to
be maintained for at least 8 weeks. PFS was defined
as the time from the end of induction treatment in
the subgroup of patients who achieved a CR or PR,
encompassing the time of consolidation/maintenance treatment, until the last follow-up, the time at
which disease progression occurred, or the time of
death from any cause. Similarly, OS was measured
from the end of induction treatment to either the
last time the patient was seen alive or the date of
death.

Sample Size Determination
With a 2-sided significance level (a) of 5% and an
80% power 1-b, in total, 46 patients would be eligible
to receive consolidation and maintenance therapy,
and 12 events would be enough to reveal a 55%
increase in 5-year PFS after inclusion in the study
(from 32% to 87% in the consolidation/maintenance
group).33
Statistical Analysis
For the efficacy analysis, patients had to have
received at least 1 cycle of therapy. Rate comparisons
between patient subgroups were performed by using
the 2-tailed Fisher exact test. Event-related data (survival and PFS) were estimated by using the KaplanMeier product limit method. Prognostic subgroups
were compared by using the log-rank test. Statistical
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed
using Statistica software (version 6.0 for Windows).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The pretreatment features of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 60 years
(range, 37–74 years). All patients met the guidelines
criteria for having CLL.27 According to Rai staging
criteria,1 7 patients (9%) had low-risk CLL (stage 0),
65 patients (87%) had intermediate-risk CLL (stage I
or II), and 3 patients (4%) had high-risk CLL (stage
III or IV). More than half of the patients (55%) had a
good ECOG performance status (0). The time from
diagnosis to treatment ranged from 1 to 10 years.
Only 23 of 75 patients (31%) exhibited B symptoms.

Toxicity
Focusing on the consolidation and maintenance program, the 3 most frequent side effects were infusionrelated toxicity, myelosuppression, and infections.
Four of 28 patients who received rituximab in consolidation/maintenance experienced a mild infusionrelated symptom complex consisting of fever, chills,
and rigors. There were 7 opportunistic infections,
including 3 dermatomal herpes zoster infections and
4 localized herpes simplex infections, but no pulmonary toxicity was observed. Hematologic toxicity
included only neutropenia (grade 1 and/or 2 in 8
patients, grade 3 and/or 4 in 4 patients) during rituximab treatment.
Response to Treatment and Treatment Outcome
All patients who were enrolled on this study (n 5 75
patients) were evaluable for response. The response
induction rate included a first induction CR rate of
65% after fludarabine that jumped to 83% after rituximab. Seventy-one patients in CR or PR after induction entered the protocol consolidation and
maintenance study (Table 2). MRD analysis performed on BM by flow cytometry after induction
therapy was positive (>1% CD191/CD51/CD79b2
CLL cells) in 29 of 71 patients (41%). All patients in
PR (n 5 10) were positive for MRD, and 19 of 61
patients in CR (31%) were positive for MRD (Fig. 1A).

patients) within 1 year after the completion of induction treatment underwent consolidation/maintenance
therapy with rituximab. Eighteen patients (14 in CR

clinical features underwent observation only, including
12 patients with MRD-positive BM after induction and
6 patients with MRD in PBLs >1000/mL within 1 year

(Table 3). In addition, 25 patients in CR with persistently MRD-negative BM (>1 year) were observed only
and compared with the subset of consolidated patients
in terms of PFS.
Outcome data relative to PFS and OS are shown
in Figures 2A and 2B. The estimated 5-year PFS after
the end of induction treatment was 73% (Fig. 2A).
After a median of 26 months of follow-up from
the beginning of consolidation/maintenance or observation (March 2000), until the end of June 2006, 13 of
71 patients (18%) experienced disease recurrence.
Among the 46 patients who were enrolled in the
consolidation/maintenance or observation study, 3
patients died. One patient died in CR of a fulminant B
hepatitis, and 2 other patients died of progressive CLL
after receipt of the prescribed protocol therapy.
It is interesting to note that MRD-positive
patients who underwent consolidation therapy
(n 5 28 patients) had a significantly longer response
duration (87% vs 32% at 5 years; P 5 .001) (Fig. 3A)
compared with the subset of patients who were not
consolidated and were positive for MRD in BM or
PBLs (n 5 18 patients). It also is worth noting that
patients with persistently MRD-negative BM (>1
year; n 5 25 patients) had a response duration similar to that of the consolidated patients (Fig. 3B).

Clinical and Biologic Features Predicting Response
and Outcome
Thirty-five patients (47%) were identified who had
ZAP-70 expression >20% (range, 4–70%), and 23 of
75 patients (31%) presented CD38 values >20%

analysis, 26 patients (49%) had a normal karyotype,

and 12 patients (23%) had an ‘‘intermediate/highrisk’’ karyotype encompassing trisomy 12 (5

(n 5 35 patients), considering only the MRD-positive

who had ZAP-70 levels >20% (ZAP-70-positive [ZAP-701] vs ZAP-70-negative [neg]), CD38 levels >20% (CD381 vs CD38-negative [CD382]), IgVH unmutated status (UM) (vs mutated [M]), and ‘‘intermediate/high-risk’’ cytogenetic status (trisomy 12, deletion 11q, deletion 17p).

darabine followed by 4 cycles of rituximab was very
effective in patients with untreated B-CLL, and we
demonstrated that consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab prolonged the response duration

in MRD-positive patients. Rituximab dramatically
increased response rates. After fludarabine therapy,
65% of patients achieved CR. This CR rate jumped to
83% after rituximab treatment. This very high CR
rate was achieved because nearly all of our patients
(65 of 75 patients) had intermediate Rai stage disease. In fact, the treatment of this progressive subset
before the appearance of anemia or thrombocytopenia allowed us to obtain very good results in terms of
both response and response duration. It is noteworthy that PFS outcomes also were impressive after
rituximab, and the consolidation/maintenance
approach using the same drug resulted in an
improved 5-year PFS rate of 73%. Moreover, this
treatment regimen is feasible and can be administered safely on an outpatient basis. The risk of
opportunistic infections may increase at first by
combining fludarabine and rituximab in induction
and then prolonging rituximab infusions in the consolidation and maintenance therapy, because fludarabine leads to profound depletion of T cells, whereas
rituximab causes prolonged depletion of B lymphocytes.34,35 During consolidation/maintenance, most
of these infections were viral, and they often were
localized. Grade 3 and/or 4 hematologic toxicity was
observed almost exclusively for neutropenia. None-

theless, this excess neutropenia did not predispose
patients to an excess number of neutropenic fever
episodes or life-threatening infections.
Moreover, there was no event of autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, most likely because the transient
B-cell depletion caused by rituximab may avoid the
development of fludarabine-associated hemolytic
anemia. One concern regarding the use of rituximab
in patients with CLL, particularly in consolidation/
maintenance, may be infusion-related toxicity. Studies have demonstrated that rituximab can cause
severe infusion-related toxicity in a minority of
patients and that a high number of circulating B-CLL
cells may predispose patients to this problem.36 In
our study, only 4 patients had a mild infusion-related
symptom complex, which consisted of fever, chills,
and rigors, during consolidation/maintenance with
rituximab. Most likely, the low infusion toxicity
observed with rituximab treatment during consolidation/maintenance was because of the lower leukocyte counts.
The employment of an MRD assay by flow cytometry allowed us to define patients in CR as positive
or negative for MRD. That is important, because
patients in CR based on NCI criteria who are positive
for MRD may develop recurrent disease more easily.
To avoid this risk, consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab was proposed by our group.
Twenty-eight MRD-positive patients who were in CR
or PR before the consolidated treatment scheme had
a significantly increased 5-year PFS rate compared
with unconsolidated MRD-positive patients (Fig. 3A).
Therefore,
rituximab
consolidation/maintenance
therapy was crucial to prolonging PFS in MRD-positive patients, allowing them to reach the same
response duration as that achieved by persistently
MRD-negative patients (Fig. 3B). In data from the literature on patients with follicular lymphoma, a >2fold longer duration of remission was achieved with
rituximab maintenance compared with observation
in a multicenter, Phase III trial.16 Moreover, a histologic subgroup analysis from a randomized Phase II
trial of rituximab revealed longer PFS with the maintenance regimen than with the retreatment regimen
in patients with either follicular NHL (median, 31
months vs 13 months; n 5 62 patients) or B-cell CLL
(median, 34 months vs 6 months; n 5 28 patients).17
Moreover, the use of lower doses of rituximab during
the maintenance phase could reduce the loss of
CD20 antigen from the surface of circulating B
cells.37 It is believed that this process of antigenic
modulation occurs through ‘‘shaving off’’ of the
rituximab-CD20 complexes by monocytes or macrophages in a reaction mediated by Fcg receptors.37 In

fact, results from a pilot study in this patient population suggest that the loss of CD20 antigen can be
reduced and the efficacy of rituximab can be
improved with the use of low doses of rituximab that
still provide adequate targeting and clearance of circulating CD201 B lymphocytes.38 The efficacy of our
maintenance approach may be explained on the basis of this recent experience.38
Various clinical features, including age, Rai stage,
and serum b2-microglobulin, have been associated
with lower response and poor long-term treatment
outcomes after alkylator-based and purine analogbased therapy for CLL.39 Recent studies examining
molecular aberrations (ie, p53 mutations), unfavorable cytogenetics, CD38 expression, somatic VH gene
mutational status, and ZAP-70 expression have
demonstrated that all of these factors are important
determinants for treatment outcome in patients with
CLL.40 It is interesting to note that, in our study,
higher ZAP-70 levels, CD38 overexpression, and IgVH
unmutated status identified subsets of patients who
had a poor prognosis with regard to PFS measured
from the end of induction treatment (Fig. 4). Thus,
these markers may be used prospectively to identify
subsets of patients who have a low likelihood of
improved outcomes with a rituximab consolidation
and maintenance approach. Conversely, an MRD
assay performed by flow cytometry may allow us
to identify MRD-positive patients who should be
treated with a consolidation/maintenance immunotherapy approach, because they are at the greatest
risk of disease recurrence. Furthermore, within the
ZAP-701 patients, considering only MRD-positive
patients, consolidated patients had a better course
than unconsolidated patients. Therefore, consolidation and maintenance therapy with rituximab significantly improves the clinical outcome of patients with
B-CLL.41 Our experience should encourage the use of
consolidation/maintenance treatment with rituximab
in CLL. In fact, the ultimate objective in CLL therapy
is not only to achieve high CR rates but also (and
mainly) to avoid disease recurrence, thus prolonging
remission duration and, finally, OS. Improved OS
may be expected in patients who receive rituximab
maintenance therapy because of the effect it has on
B-cell depletion; at 1-year follow-up, the level of circulating B lymphocytes remained low in patients
who received rituximab maintenance, whereas it rose
above the baseline value in patients who received no
further rituximab treatment.16 In conclusion, our
study demonstrated that a consolidation and maintenance therapy with rituximab further prolongs the
response duration in MRD-positive patients with BCLL.
