ABSTRACT
The objective of the work was to develop a multifunctional nanomedicine based
on a folate-conjugated lipid nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel and curcumin.
The novel system combines therapeutic advantageous of efficient targeted delivery
via folate and timed-release of curcumin and paclitaxel via 2-hydroxypropyl-ßcyclodextrin, thereby overcoming multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells (MCF7/ADR). The faster release of curcumin from the folate-conjugated curcumin and
paclitaxel-loaded lipid nanoparticles enables sufficient p-glycoprotein inhibition,
which allows increased cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of paclitaxel. In western blot
assay, curcumin can efficiently inhibit the expression of p-glycoprotein, conformed the
enhancement of cytotoxicity by paclitaxel. Furthermore, folate-conjugated curcumin
and paclitaxel-loaded lipid nanoparticles exhibited increased uptake of paclitaxel and
curcumin into MCF-7/ADR cells through the folate receptor-mediated internalization.
Taken together, these results indicate that folate-conjugated curcumin and paclitaxelloaded lipid nanoparticles enables the enhanced, folate-targeted delivery of multiple
anticancer drugs by inhibiting the multi-drug resistance efficiently, which may also
serve as a useful nano-system for co-delivery of other anticancer drugs.

for various solid tumors such as ovarian, breast, and
lung cancers [9]. Although paclitaxel is the first choice
for the treatment of breast cancer, its use is limited due
to the limited uptake of the drug by p-gp. Curcumin, a
polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of the plant
Curcuma longa Linn (turmeric). It has a variety of
pharmacologic effects including anti-amyloid, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and antispasmodic activity without any major side effects [10–12].
Specially, several groups have reported that curcumin
could be used as a chemotherapeutic agent [13, 14].
Furthermore, some studies demonstrated the curcumin
independently exhibited p-gp inhibitory activity by downregulation of the PI3K/Akt and NF-kB pathways [15,
16]. Therefore, curcumin could be used as an effective
p-gp inhibitor on MDR-expressing cancer cells by coadministration with an anticancer drug to maximize the
cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug. However, the low
solubility and poor stability of curcumin in physiological

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers
for women and still a major reason of death. Among breast
cancer cell lines, MCF-7/ADR cells are known as multidrug resistance (MDR) expressing cells. The development
of MDR is one of the major challenges leading to the
failure of several conventional chemotherapies [1, 2]. The
increased efflux of hydrophobic drugs from the cell by
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter trans-membrane
proteins such as p-glycoprotein (p-gp, also known as
MDR1) results in a prevention of drug accumulation, thus
reducing the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs
[3]. An attractive approach to overcome MDR expressing
cancer cells is to co-delivery p-gp inhibitor along with the
anticancer drug, thereby achieving enhanced accumulation
of the anticancer drug and therapeutic efficacy [4–8].

environment result in its poor bioavailability and
therapeutic effect [17].
On the other hand, conventional co-delivery
systems showed a few disadvantages such as unsuitable
release profiles, use of conventional p-gp inhibitors which
have toxicity to normal cells and non-targeted property.
Hence, ideal delivery systems for combination should
have targeting property and optimal release profile.
Namely, the chance of exposure of anticancer agent
and p-gp inhibitor to normal cells or tissues should be
minimized and localized in a specific targeted cells or
tissues. Furthermore, this system should use non-toxic
p-gp inhibitor such as curcumin instead of conventional
p-gp inhibitor such as verapamil and dronedarone that
have toxicity [18]. However, conventional paclitaxel and
curcumin nanosystems have been reported to delivery two
drugs in similar release pattern [19]. The similar release
rate of paclitaxel and curcumin would be an additional
issue due to insufficient release of curcumin in advance
of release of paclitaxel. In order to address the issues, it is
hypothesized that curcumin and paclitaxel can be timedreleased from our novel system, providing a controlled and
sustained drug release, along with maximized anticancer
efficacy. Considering the modulation of drug release to
inhibit p-gp first, our group developed inclusion complexloaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) that enabled to
release p-gp inhibitor faster than anticancer drug [20].
SLNs have been used in wide range of properties owing
to low toxicity and good potential in cosmetic, food and
pharmaceutical fields [21–23].
Herein, we have encapsulated curcumin in
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) to improve
its stability and water-solubility for faster release
relative to the release of paclitaxel (Figure 1A). As a
result, both the anticancer drug (paclitaxel) and the
chemosensitizer (curcumin) were able to be efficiently
delivered to the target breast cancer cells at the same
time. It is highlighted that curcumin from curcumin/
HPCD inclusion complex can be released faster, leading
to the sufficient p-gp inhibition for enhanced intracellular
accumulation of paclitaxel against MCF-7/ADR cells
(Figure 1B). Moreover, the ability to delivery huge amount
of anticancer drug to the target cancer cells can enable
to reduce the systemic side effects related to the most of
anticancer drugs [24, 25]. In order to achieve the targeting
ability, we have further conjugated folate to stearic acid
as a targeting moiety because folate binds to the folate
receptors that are widely over-expressed on surfaces of
specific cancer cells such as MCF-7/ADR cells.

properties including particle size, polydispersity index
(PDI), zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency
(EE) were listed in Table 1. PCN was shown to be
insignificantly different as compared to that of PN. The
particle size of PCN was 149.6 ± 6.9 nm, after modified
with FA, the size slightly increased to 161.5 ± 7.1 nm. On
the other hand, the particle size in FPCHN series showed
the increasing tendency according to the amount of HPCD.
As for zeta potential, all of NPs exhibited similar values.
EE (%) of paclitaxel and curcumin in all of
NPs observed to be above 75% except FPCHN-50.
Interestingly, co-encapsulation of curcumin with paclitaxel
in PCN resulted in slightly low EE of paclitaxel (81.3 ±
4.8%) as compared to that of PN (87.5 ± 3.5%). However,
FA-conjugation did not impair EE of paclitaxel and
curcumin. It was noted that the amount of HPCD used
resulted in decreasing EE of curcumin, while EE of
paclitaxel was not significantly changed. Specially, the
EE of curcumin in FPCHN-50 was significantly lower
than that of FPCN, while that of FPCHN-10 and -30 was
insignificant different compare to that of FPCN.
Surface modification of PCN with folate was
confirmed using XPS. XPS result of PCN did not show
nitrogen on the surface of NPs (Table 2), while FPCN
showed nitrogen on the surface. FPCN exhibited 9.5%
atomic concentration of nitrogen on the surface at 399.7
ev, indicating successful conjugation of SA-FA on the
surface of FPCNs.

In vitro release
In vitro drug release of paclitaxel and curcumin from
FPCN and FPCHN was conducted in PBS with 0.1% (w/v)
tween 80. In order to achieve optimal sequential release
profile of curcumin and paclitaxel, different amount
of HPCD (0, 10, 30 or 50 mg) was introduced to form
inclusion complex with curcumin. As shown in Figure
2, FPCN exhibited similar release profile of paclitaxel
and curcumin over 48 h due to similar hydrophobicity of
drugs. On the other hand, the release profile of FPCHN
revealed a faster release of curcumin than that of paclitaxel
at all the time points. Notably, release rate of curcumin
was observed to be faster with the used amount of HPCD.
The initial burst release of curcumin from FPCHN-10, 30
and 50 at 2 h was 32.3 ± 4.7%, 41.3 ± 6.8% and 63.8
± 7.1%, respectively. In particular, FPCHN-50 exhibited
huge burst release of curcumin among the FPCHNs and
all of curcumin was fully released in 12 h. Interestingly,
the release rate of paclitaxel was statistically insignificant
different among the all FPCHNs. It was emphasized that
the release of curcumin from FPCHNs exhibited faster
at all times in comparison with that of paclitaxel and can
be adjusted with different amount of HPCD. For further
studies, the FPCHN-30 was chosen in consideration of
the particle size, polydispersity index, encapsulation
efficiency and release profile of curcumin and paclitaxel.

paclitaxel+curcumin) showed significant higher uptake
of paclitaxel (5.1 ± 0.3 ng/μg) compared to that of free
paclitaxel (1.1 ± 0.1 ng/μg). Further enhanced cellular
uptake of paclitaxel (10.2 ± 0.8 ng/μg) was achieved by
encapsulation of drugs in nanoparticles (PCN). Folateconjugation of PCN (FPCN) also exhibited significant
increment of internalized paclitaxel (14.9 ± 1.3 ng/
μg) compared to that of non-conjugated PCN. Notably,
FPCHN-30 exhibited the highest cellular paclitaxel uptake
(19.1 ± 1.1 ng/μg) among the tested formulations and 1.44
times higher than that of FPCN.
In order to further investigate the uptake of
curcumin in MCF-7/ADR cells, the fluorescence of
curcumin was measured by confocal microscopy. This
evaluation has been reported as the indirect method of
nanocarrier penetration into the cells [26]. As shown
in Figure 4, all of NPs allowed for higher uptake of

The quantitative cellular uptake of paclitaxel from
the different formulations was presented in Figure 3. From
the results, the co-treatment of paclitaxel and curcumin
exhibited increased uptake of paclitaxel compared
to that of paclitaxel alone. In addition, encapsulation
of both drugs in nanoparticles allowed for enhanced
uptake of paclitaxel compared to free paclitaxel and
curcumin. Furthermore, FA-conjugation allowed for
further enhancement of cellular uptake of paclitaxel by
receptor-mediated uptake. Figure 3 shows that the uptake
of paclitaxel of free paclitaxel+curcumin, PCN, FPCN
and FPCHN-30 were higher than that of free paclitaxel.
Except free paclitaxel, all of formulations exhibited timedependent uptake of paclitaxel in MCF-7/ADR cells.
At 8 h, co-treatment of curcumin and paclitaxel (free

curcumin into the cells than free curcumin alone. Similar
to the uptake of paclitaxel, the uptake of curcumin was
enhanced by nano-encapsulation, folate-conjugation,
and modification of release of curcumin. As such, PCN
exhibited more internalization of curcumin than free
curcumin. In addition, additional internalization of
curcumin was achieved by active-targeting of folateconjugation. Specially, FPCHN-30 was able to be more
internalized than FPCN.
Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to figure
out the cellular uptake mechanism of FPCHN-30 on MCF7/ADR cells. Firstly, an effect of temperature on cellular
uptake was tested by incubating the cells with FPCHN-30
at 4 or 37°C for 4 h (Figure 5). The uptake of curcumin in
FPCHN-30 decreased to 4.6% at 4°C as compared to the
normal condition (37°C). Next, the endocytosis inhibitors,
sodium azide (NaN3) and sucrose, were co-treated with
FPCHN-30 in MCF-7/ADR cells, respectively. The
introduction of NaN3 and sucrose reduced the mean
intensity of curcumin to 38.7 and 26.5%, respectively.

assay for 24 and 48 h. As seen in Figure 6A and 6B, cotreatment of curcumin and paclitaxel (free paclitaxel/
curcumin) induced cell viability compare to that of free
paclitaxel at all tested concentrations. Similarly, to uptake
results, nano-encapsulation and folate-conjugation allowed
for increment of cytotoxicity. Notably, it was observed
that FPCHN-30 exhibited the highest cytotoxicity among
tested formulations on MCF-7/ADR cells. All of NPs
exhibited time-dependent cytotoxicity.
Subsequently, the effect of folate targeting on the
cytotoxic potential of the PCN, FPCN and FPCHN-30
on the MCF-7/ADR cells was evaluated (Figure 6C and
6D). As expected, the results showed that the cell viability
of folate-conjugated formulations including FPCN and
FPCHN-30 was recovered when FA was co-treated.
Nevertheless, it was highlighted that FPCHN-30 with FA
exhibited significantly induced cell viability in the tested
formulations (p < 0.01).

treated with different formulations. As shown in Figure 7,
co-treatment of curcumin with paclitaxel inhibited p-gp
expression compared to that of untreated cells. Additional
inhibition of p-gp expression was achieved by folateconjugation. Notably, FPCHN-30 was observed to maximize
inhibition of p-gp expression in the formulations tested.
Equal protein loading was verified by the integrity of β-actin.

Immunofluorescence staining was further conducted
to visualize the expression of p-gp (Figure 8). In order to
investigate the effect of different formulations, the chosen
formulations were incubated with MCF-7/ADR cells for 4
h. Similarly, to the result of western blot, the co-treatment
of paclitaxel and curcumin showed p-gp inhibitory effect
compared to that of untreated cells. In addition, FA

the use of nanocarrier that concurrently encapsulates
and releases multiple drugs in controlled manner, while
providing a targeting ability to the cancer cells.
In this study, a novel FA-conjugated targeting and
sequential releasing of multiple drugs (i.e. paclitaxel
and curcumin) loaded lipid nanoparticles (FPCHN) was
developed for the smart approach on the efficient treatment
in MDR expressing MCF-7/ADR cells. Paclitaxel is
known as the first-line for the treatment of breast cancer.
Recently, curcumin has been known as p-gp inhibitor as
well as anticancer drug. Hence, it was hypothesized that
first release of curcumin could inhibit p-gp and increase
the cellular uptake of paclitaxel. A few studies have
reported to overcome p-gp and enhance cytotoxicity by
co-administration of a p-gp inhibitor with anticancer drug

DISCUSSION
MDR is a major limitation for a treatment of cancer
because most of cancer-induced deaths are attributed to
metastases that are resistant to anticancer drugs [3, 27]. A
first choice of the treatment of drug-resistant tumors is a
combination therapy of anticancer drugs. The therapeutic
effect of such combination therapy, however, is often
insufficient due to the different pharmacokinetics of the
drugs [28] and uncontrolled release for overcoming MDR
[29]. A promising approach for addressing the issues is

[20, 30]. Besides, both of drugs could show synergistic
effect because curcumin and paclitaxel have different
cytotoxic mechanisms. It is known that paclitaxel induces
the apoptosis of cancer cells by stopping microtubules
disassembly, thereby inhibiting cell division [31]. On the
other hand, curcumin is known to block the transcriptional
factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB that is a major inhibitor of
cell proliferation, apoptosis and resistance of cells [15,
16]. Hence, co-treatment of curcumin and paclitaxel
could enhance cytotoxicity against cancer cells compare
to conventional single chemotherapy. In order to maximize
the synergistic and therapeutic effects and minimize drugdrug interaction of paclitaxel and curcumin, sequential
release of curcumin and paclitaxel was achieved by
the addition of HPCD. The FPCHN was successfully
conjugated with FA for the targeting to the folate receptorexpressing MCF-7/ADR cells. The addition of SA-FA to
the lipid phase could increase the amount of lipid in the
organic phase and results in increased viscosity of the in
particle size [30].
The particle size range of all NPs was shown to
be less than 200 nm except FPCHN-50. Such physical
characteristics of all NPs in the range of 10-200 nm are
likely advantageous to the NPs in exploiting the enhanced
permeation and retention (EPR) effect against solid tumors

through the leaky vasculature [32, 33]. The use of HPCD
(50 mg) caused negative effect on FPCHN in terms of
size, polydispersity index, and encapsulation efficiency
while less amount of HPCD (10 and 30 mg) did not impair
physicochemical properties of formulations.
The hydrophobicity can enhance EE and decrease
release rate of drug in lipid nanoparticles. Hydrophobic
drug can strongly interact with hydrophobic lipid matrix,
thus allowing high EE and sustained release. Meanwhile,
it was reported that the increased particle size of FPCN
results in increasing the distance between the core and
the surface [30]. This is why the release of both drugs
loaded in FPCN was less at all times in comparison with
that of PCN. Specially, FPCHN showed the controlled
release of both drugs, and release of curcumin was faster
than release of paclitaxel because curcumin/HPCD may
be located near surface of NPs due to lower lipophilicity
of curcumin in comparison with that of paclitaxel [20].
For release of paclitaxel, insignificant difference was
observed in tested formulations. On the other hand, the
release profile of curcumin for FPCNHs was accelerated
according to the amount of HPCD. It was noted that the
release of curcumin from FPCHNs was faster than that of
paclitaxel at all-time points, while FPCN exhibited similar
release of curcumin and paclitaxel. It was reported that the

release of drugs from lipid nanoparticles can be influenced
by the nature of the lipid matrix, surfactant concentration
and production parameters as well as solubility of the drug
in lipid matrix and partition coefficient [34–37]. From this
perspective, similar lipophilicity of curcumin (log P: 3.29)
and paclitaxel (log P: 3.96) could be reason for similar
release of both drugs from FPCN. On the other hand, faster

release of curcumin from FPCHNs is attributed to the
hydrophilic nature of surface of HPCD, which facilitates
complete solubilization of curcumin in the release medium
[20]. The hydrophilic curcumin/HPCD complex was
localized near surface of lipid nanoparticles due to weak
interaction between lipid and inclusion complex, which
providing faster release of curcumin/HPCD from lipid

nanoparticle [38]. Among tested FPCHNs, FPCHN-30
was chosen after taking into consideration of EE and
release profile. FPCHN-30 exhibited about 40% of burst
release, followed by sustained release up to 48 h as well
as similar encapsulation efficiency of curcumin and
paclitaxel as compared to that of FPCN. The faster release
of curcumin provided the opportunity to inhibit p-gp
expression, whereby followed release of paclitaxel could
be easily taken up by MCF-7/ADR cells.
The cellular uptake of different formulations was
evaluated in MCF-7/ADR cells. The free paclitaxel
showed poor cellular uptake of paclitaxel due to the
p-gp efflux, while all of NPs prepared were easily taken
up by the cells [39, 40]. Co-treatment of curcumin with
paclitaxel enabled for further enhanced internalization
of paclitaxel as compared to that of free paclitaxel,
which indicating the p-gp inhibition of curcumin [41,
42]. In addition, FA-conjugated NPs exhibited further
enhancement of internalization of paclitaxel. The active
targeting interaction between the FA and the FA-receptor
overexpressed on membrane of MCF-7/ADR cells
allows FPCN and FPCHN-30 to be easily taken up by
the cells. As expected, sequential release of curcumin
and paclitaxel from FPCHN-30 exhibited the highest
paclitaxel uptake among tested formulations. All of
cellular uptake results obtained were well correlated with
cytotoxicity results.
Next, flow cytometry analysis was conducted
to figure out the cellular uptake mechanism for the
FPCHN-30. Firstly, the effect of temperature on cellular
uptake was studies by incubating the cells with FPCHN-30
at 37°C or 4°C for 4 h. As seen in Figure 5, the uptake
of FPCHN-30 was significantly reduced by 95% at 4°C
due to a frozen state of cell membranes. So, particles
were not able to be internalized via interaction between
particles and cell membranes, which results in a significant
decrease of their uptake. Sodium azide (NaN3) is widely
used as endocytosis inhibitor agent which is known
to disturb the production of ATP in cells and block the
endocytotic pathway [43]. In this study, mean fluorescence
intensity of curcumin from FPCHN-30 was reduced by
about 60%. Sucrose is known to disrupt the formation
of clathrin-coated vesicles and used as an endocytosis
inhibitor [44]. In this study, pretreatment with sucrose
significantly reduced the uptake of FPCHN-30 by about
70%. These results suggested that internalization of
FPCHN-30 depended on a temperature-, energy- and
clathrin-dependent pathway.
In order to confirm the enhanced cellular uptake of
paclitaxel and curcumin, cell cytotoxicity was measured
by MTT assay. All the formulations exhibited higher
cytotoxicity as compared to that of free paclitaxel and
curcumin. In addition, folate conjugation onto surface of
NPs allowed for further cytotoxicity. It was highlighted that
FPCHN-30 exhibited still higher cytotoxicity compared to
that of FPCN when the NPs were co-incubated with folate.
FPCHN-30, rate-controlling and active-targeting delivery

system, exhibited the highest cytotoxicity as well as cellular
uptake on MCF-7/ADR cells.
Finally, the p-gp inhibition efficiency of
FPCHN-30 was evaluated by western blot assay and
immunofluorescence staining. From the results obtained,
FPCHN-30 exhibited maximum inhibition of p-gp
among tested group. Similarly, to the results of cell
studies, co-treatment of curcumin exhibited depressed
p-gp expression as compared to that of paclitaxel alone.
Specially, sequential release of curcumin and paclitaxel
from FPCHN-30 was observed to have better inhibition of
p-gp, strongly indicating the importance of release profile
of both drugs and active targeting to achieve the enhanced
therapeutic efficiency. The faster release of curcumin was
able to inhibit p-gp efficiently so that paclitaxel could be
easily internalized in MCF-7/ADR cells.
On the basis of our experimental studies, FPCHN-30
could be used as a promising therapeutic delivery system
for MDR-expressing breast cancer cells by sequential
release of p-gp inhibitor and anticancer drug, and active
targeting to FA receptors (Figure 1A and 1B).

CONCLUSIONS
From this study, we presented a promising approach
to improve the cellular uptake of paclitaxel and curcumin
into MCF-7/ADR cells that express folate receptors and
p-gp. Our novel system exhibited a significant enhanced
cytotoxicity and cellular uptake from the combined effects
of optimized sequential release of multiple drugs and
folate receptor-mediated internalization by manipulating
hydrophilicities and conjugation of folate with lipid. Since
targeting ability and controlled release of curcumin and
paclitaxel are achievable with FPCHN-30, this nanocarrier
would have great potential to inhibit MDR-expressing
tumor cells.

100mg) and TPGS (100 mg) were dissolved in 10 mL of
chloroform to produce an oil phase. The oil phase was
added to the aqueous phase containing 1.5% Tween 80 and
homogenized (Ultra Turrax T25) for 3 min at 12,000 rpm.
The obtained emulsion was sonicated for 5 min. In order
to achieve optimal release profile of curcumin, curcumin/
HPCD was synthesized with different amount of HPCD
(10, 30 or 50 mg).
Folate-conjugated curcumin and paclitaxel
loaded SLNs (FPCN) were prepared by adding 5 mg of
conjugated stearic acid and folate (SA-FA) in the organic
lipid phase using the same method described above.
The SA-FA was synthesized using EDC (1-ethyl-3(3dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) coupling reaction
[30, 39]. Presence of SA-FA on the surface was confirmed
by XPS analysis.

The particle size and zeta potential analysis of
different nanoparticles were performed by laser scattering
analyzer (ELS-8000, Otasuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan).
The lyophilized nanoparticles were dispersed in distilled
water and sonicated to minimize the inter-particle
interactions. The obscuration range was maintained
between 20~50%. The instrument was set to measure the
sample 100 times and the average volume mean diameter
was obtained. The zeta potential of different nanoparticles
was measured by Zetasizer Nano Z (Malven, UK). Data
were collected as the average of 20 measurements.

In vitro release study
In vitro release studies of different formulations
were evaluated using a dialysis bag (molecular weight
cut-off of 7000 (Membra-Cel; Viskase, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA)), which was filled with an amount according to 20
mg of formulation. Then, dialysis bag was immersed in
20 mL of phosphate buffered solution (PBS) including
0.1% (w/v) of tween 80. Aliquots of 1 mL samples were
withdrawn from the medium and replaced with the same
volume of fresh dissolution medium at an indicated time.
The concentrations of the released drugs were determined
by HPLC as described above.

X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS)
The presence of folate in SA-FA on the particle
surface was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (MultiLab 2000, Thermo). The lyophilized
nanoparticle samples were applied on a clean aluminum
substrate and kept under vacuum. The surface chemical
composition on the nanoparticles was examined using a
surface spectrophotometer. XPS analysis was conducted
for PCN and FPCN.

Cell culture

Analysis of drug loading and encapsulation
efficiency

MCF-7/ADR cell line was purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

The lyophilized nanoparticles (10 mg) were
solubilized with 1 mL of ethanol, heated at 80°C for
30 min and then cooled down at -20°C for 30 min.
This solution was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min to
precipitate the undissolved solid lipid, filtered through
a 0.22 μm filter and injected into the HPLC system. An
Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system with an
autosampler and UV detector were used. The column
used was a C18 column (4.0 x 250 mm, 5 μm particle
size, SupelcoTM; MetaChem, USA). The flow rate
of the mobile phase was 1 mL/min and the detection
wavelength of paclitaxel or curcumin was set to 227
nm or 425 nm, respectively. The mobile phase of
paclitaxel or curcumin was a mixture of distilled water
and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) or distilled water and
acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) adjusted pH 2.5 by formic acid,
respectively. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency
(E.E) were calculated as follows:
Drug loading (%) = weight of the drug in particles /
weight of the particles x 100.
E.E (%) = weight of the drug in particles / weight of
the feeding drugs x 100.

Cellular uptake
To evaluate quantitative uptake of paclitaxel, the
cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at the density of 1
x 106 cells per well. After 24 h incubation, the cells were
further incubated with different formulations at different
concentrations at 37°C. After the incubation period,
the cell medium containing different formulations was
removed from the wells and the cells were washed with
cold PBS. The cells were lysed for 10 min by addition
of 1% Triton X-100 (400 μL) per each well. After that,
an aliquot of the cell lysate was used to measure the total
cell protein amount by the BCA assay. The concentration
of paclitaxel in the cell lysate was measured by HPLC as
described above.
For cellular uptake of curcumin, the cells were
incubated on glass base dish (Thermo scientific, USA)
and were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy

Immunofluorescence staining

(CLSM, Model: LSM5LIVE; Carl Zeiss, Wetzlar,
Germany). In glass base dish, MCF-7/ADR cells were
seeded at a density of 1 x 106 cells per well in 1 mL of
growth medium and incubated for 24 h to allow them
to attach. The cells were then treated with the different
formulations in growth medium. At predetermined time
point (4 h), the cells were washed three times with cold
PBS. Then, cells were stained with 1 μg/mL DAPI in PBS
for 3 min and washed twice with PBS. The cells were
observed directly under the CLSM.
In order to determine quantitative uptake of
curcumin, the cells were washed three times with cold
PBS, then collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in
PBS (1 mL). The mean fluorescent intensity of curcumin
in the cells was measured on a BD LSRFortessa flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA).
Flow cytometry analysis was adapted and
four separate experiments were conducted including
pretreatment of 450 mM of sucrose and 80 mM of sodium
azide (NaN3) for 0.5 h. The effect of temperature on
cellular uptake was assessed by incubation at 37 and 4°C.

In glass base dish, MCF-7/ADR (1 x 106) cells
were seeded on glass base dish (Thermo scientific, USA)
and incubated for 24 h to allow them to attach. The
cells were then treated with the different formulations
in growth medium. At predetermined time point (4 h),
the cells were washed three times with PBS. Then, cells
were treated with p-gp antibody C219 (1:100 dilutions,
Thermo scientific, Rockford, USA) for 2 h, followed by
Alexa 555 antibody 1:1000 dilutions, Thermo scientific,
Rockford, USA). Then, cells were stained with 1 μg/mL
DAPI in PBS for 3 min and washed twice with cold PBS.
Fluorescence images of the cells were observed directly
using the CLSM.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to compare the groups. A p
< 0.05 as considered to indicate statistical significance. All
data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation from
three independent experiments.

Cytotoxicity assays

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

To determine cytotoxicity of the various
formulations, the MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich) was
conducted. Briefly, MCF-7/ADR cells were seeded in 96well plates at a cell density of 5×104 cells/mL (200 μL/
well). After confluency, the cells were further incubated
with the various formulations for 48 h. The culture
medium was replaced by MTT solution (5 mg/mL, 200
μL/well), and the cells were incubated for a further 4 h.
The supernatant was carefully removed, and 200 μL of
DMSO was added to the each well. The plates were then
placed in an incubator for 30 min. The absorbance values
of each well were measured at 570 nm using a microplate
reader (Sunrise™; Tecan, Austria).
