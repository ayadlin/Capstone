BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with localized gastroesophageal carcinoma (LGC) can be defined after
chemoradiation by the standardized uptake value (SUV) of positron emission tomography (PET). High SUV (HSUV)
after chemoradiation portends a poor prognosis. The authors retrospectively examined the role of surgery in patients
with HSUV after chemoradiation. METHODS: The authors analyzed the postchemoradiation PET scans of 204 LGC
patients. One hundred twenty-nine patients had HSUV. Two postchemoradiation variables were evaluated: SUV and
surgery and their association with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). The log-rank test, multivariate
Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier survival plots were used to assess the association between OS or
EFS and the dichotomized SUV (using the median SUV as the cutoff) and surgery. RESULTS: The median SUV was
4.6. The OS of the 52 patients who had an SUV above the median and did not undergo surgery (HSUV-NS) (median
OS, 1.22 years; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-2.16 years) was much shorter than that of the 77 patients with
an SUV above the median who underwent surgery (HSUV-S) (median OS, 2.7 years; 95% CI, 2.43 years to not
reached [P <.0001]). Similarly, the EFS for patients with HSUV-NS was significantly shorter than that for patients with
HSUV-S (P ¼ .001). In the multivariate analyses, patients who underwent surgery (irrespective of SUV) had a lower
risk of death (P ¼ .0001) and disease progression (P ¼ .002). CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study suggest that surgery may prolong OS and EFS in patients with a poor prognosis after chemoradiation as defined by PET.

Esophageal carcinoma imposes a significant health burden worldwide. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma
of the esophagus is declining in the West, but that of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction
has increased over the past 25 years1,2 Adenocarcinoma is diagnosed in late stages when patients have substantial symptoms; therefore, the mortality rate from it continues to increase.2 Nevertheless, localized gastroesophageal carcinoma
(LGC) is a potentially curable condition. Patients with LGC are often offered chemoradiation3,4 in a definitive manner
or preoperatively,5,6 but the results from the published randomized trials on preoperative chemoradiation do not support
its benefit.7-11 Surgery remains an important component of therapy in physiologically fit patients.12,13

When treated with a similar therapeutic strategy,
the outcome of patients with LGC remains unpredictable. To the best of our knowledge, the reasons
for this unpredictability in clinical outcome are not
entirely clear but could be attributed to the differences in molecular compositions of cancers14-18 and/or
patient genetics.19,20 However, the imaging techniques
with [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) are able to provide some discrimination with regard to the prognosis of patients
with LGC.21-32 We have reported that the standardized uptake value (SUV) after chemoradiation can
divide the LGC patients into 2 groups: 1) a better
prognostic group if the postchemoradiation SUV is
low and 2) a poor prognostic group if the postchemoradiation SUV is high.30,33 The overall survival
(OS) and event-free survival (EFS) are significantly
different in these 2 groups, and in the multivariate
analyses, the postchemoradiation SUV was found to
be an independent prognosticator of OS and EFS.33
It would be important to address the role of surgery
to improve outcomes in the patient population with
high SUV (HSUV) after chemoradiation. We believe
all patients with LGC who can withstand surgery
should be offered surgery, but to our knowledge it is
not known whether surgical resection improves the
outcome of patients whose tumors demonstrate
aggressive clinical behavior as defined by postchemoradiation PET results. The other consideration is in
patients who are initially believed to be unsuitable
for a trimodality approach (TM, or preoperative chemoradiation followed by an attempted surgical resection), but have HSUV after chemoradiation; should
they be reconsidered for surgery?
The objective of the current study was to retrospectively assess whether the outcome of patients with
postchemoradiation HSUV is different in patients
who underwent surgery compared with those who did
not undergo surgery. To reduce bias in this analysis,
we also added a third cohort of patients who had low
SUV (LSUV) (less than the median of 4.6, the median value in this study) after chemoradiation and
underwent surgery (LSUV-S). It is not known
whether surgery provides any clinical benefit to
patients who have a poor prognosis as determined by
postchemoradiation PET. We analyzed 204 patients
and focused on 129 patients who had HSUV after
chemoradiation to assess the impact of surgery on OS
and EFS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
LGC patients who presented to the University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 2002 through 2008
and had a PET-computed tomography (CT) scan after
chemoradiation were eligible for this retrospective study.
The primary disease site was assigned using the Siewert
classification,34 and patients with anatomic type 1 (esophageal) or type 2 (gastroesophageal) disease were included,
whereas those with T1N0 disease were excluded. Pretreatment investigations included a complete blood count,
measurement of serum electrolytes, chest radiograph, CT
scan of chest and abdomen, barium swallow radiography,
upper gastroesophageal endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound, and a PET. A multidisciplinary team (medical
oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiation oncologists,
and thoracic surgeons) evaluated every patient and
assigned an appropriate initial treatment strategy. All
patients had a PET-CT scan performed approximately 5
to 6 weeks after the end of chemoradiation. The Institutional Review Board approved this project.
Study Objectives
The objective of the current study was to assess whether
the outcome of patients with postchemoradiation HSUV
is different in patients who underwent surgery compared
with those who did not undergo surgery. Our hypothesis
was that surgery after chemoradiation would benefit some
patients with postchemoradiation HSUV.
Chemoradiotherapy
All patients received a fluoropyrimidine and a taxane or
platinum compound concurrently with radiation. The
median radiation dose delivered was 45 grays (Gy) (range,
45-50.4 Gy). Since 2005, patients at our institution have
received a radiation dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions
regardless of whether surgery is planned.
Surgery
Approximately 5 to 6 weeks after the completion of
chemoradiation, all patients were evaluated (preoperative evaluation for TM patients) with CT scans, esophagoscopy, and a PET-CT scan. All patients had
complete blood work, including serum chemistry.
Surgical procedures performed included a 3-field
esophagectomy, transhiatal esophagectomy, transthoracic
esophagectomy, or minimally invasive esophagectomy.
The type of surgery was left to the discrimination of the
individual surgeon. Extensive lymph node dissection is

routinely performed. Proximal and distal resection margins of 5 cm are the goal. Information regarding OS and
EFS were collected from the hospital records, patient
follow-up records, death records (social security database),
and the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center tumor registry.
PET-CT
FDG-PET-CT scans were performed on a dedicated
PET-CT system (Discovery ST, STe, or RX; General
Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Scan coverage
was generally from the orbits to the proximal thighs,
although coverage was altered to answer specific clinical
questions and also occasionally included the entire head
and/or the lower extremities. Scans were acquired 60 to
90 minutes after intravenous (iv) administration of FDG
with a dose range of 15 to 20 millicuries (mCi) (555-740
megabecquerel [MBq]). PET studies were acquired in either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional (3D) acquisition
mode at 3 to 5 minutes per bed position (depending on
the patient’s body mass index). Images were reconstructed
using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM)
with 128  128 matrix size and a field of view of 70 cm
(5.47-mm pixels). CT was acquired without oral or iv
contrast material and was used for attenuation correction
of the PET scan. The CT acquisition parameters were 120
kilovolt peaks, 300 millieAmperes (mAs), and 0.50-second rotation, with a pitch of 1.375. The CT images were
reconstructed using a 3.75-mm slice thickness with a slice
interval of 3.27 mm to match the PET data. PET-CT
images were reviewed on a workstation (Advantage Workstation; General Electric Medical Systems). PET, CT, and
PET-CT fusion datasets were reviewed in multiple imaging planes.
SUV Calculations
The maximum SUV (SUVmax) was based on body
weight and was calculated using a volume of interest that
was drawn to encompass the entire 3D extent of the
lesion. The SUVmax was then calculated using the following equation: SUVmax ¼ A/(ID/BW), in which A is the
maximum decay-corrected activity concentration in tissue/volume of interest (measured in mCi per mL), ID is
the injected dose of FDG (measured in mCi), and BW is
the patient’s body weight (measured in g). This gives an
SUVmax unit of g/mL. At our institution, we follow the
National Cancer Institute guidelines for image preparation, acquisition, and analyses.35-37 We used the SUVmax
because it is reproducible, unlike mean SUV, and report-

ing of SUVmax is the standard at our institution. We recognize that the consensus on optimum SUV assessment is
currently lacking and a subject of debate. Various institutional preferences exist, but for LGC patients, we have
chosen SUVmax for reporting our analyses and are willing
to consider another method when compelling data by
others investigators are reported.
Statistical Analysis
The log-rank test,38 univariate and multivariate Cox39
proportional hazards regression analyses, and KaplanMeier40 survival plot were used to evaluate the association
of the dichotomized PET SUV with OS and EFS. The
OS was computed as the time period from the initiation
of chemoradiation to either the date of death or date of
last follow-up, whichever occurred first. Patients alive at
the last follow-up date were censored. The EFS was computed as the time period from the date of chemoradiotherapy to the date of last follow-up, the date of disease
recurrence, or date of death, whichever occurred first.
Patients who were alive without disease recurrence at the
last follow-up date were censored. All statistical tests were
2-sided and performed at a .05 significance level. The SAS
software package (version 9.01) was used for computations (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Relevant patient characteristics of the 204 patients with
postchemoradiation HSUV (n ¼ 129) plus LSUV-S (n ¼
75) are shown in Table 1. As anticipated, most patients
were white men and most patients had adenocarcinoma.
PET SUV and OS and EFS
The median survival and the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
OS rates are shown in Table 2. The median survival of all
204 patients was 2.85 years (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 2.43-4.24 years). The median survival of
patients with HSUV who did not undergo surgery
(HSUV-NS) was 1.22 years (95% CI, 1.02-2.16 years)
whereas that of patients with HSUV who did undergo
surgery (HSUV-S) was 2.70 years (95% CI, 2.43 to not
estimable). The median survival of patients with LSUV-S
was 4.24 years (95% CI, 3.6 to not estimable). Figure 1
shows the Kaplan-Meier OS plots comparing patients
with HSUV-S and HSUV-NS (P <.0001), and Figure 2
shows the Kaplan-Meier OS plots when the third cohort
of LSUV-S is added (P <.0001). At least for the first 27

months, the survival curves for patients with HSUV-S
were found to be similar to those of patients with LSUV-S
(suggesting the impact of surgery), but the curves then
separated (suggesting the true metastatic potential of cancer in the HSUV-S group). It is intriguing to note that the
shapes of the curves of the HSUV-S and HSUV-NS
groups were very similar after approximately 15 months.
The EFS (Table 3) (Figs. 3 and 4) followed the same
patterns for all 3 groups (HSUV-S, HSUV-NS, and
LSUV-S) as was noted for OS.
Age and the HSUV-S, HSUV-NS, and
LSUV-S Groups
Table 4 shows that age was statistically significantly
related in the 3 groups (P ¼ .0001). The median age of
the patients with HSUV-NS was 70 years (range, 34-82
years) compared with 63 years for patients with HSUV-S,
and 61 years for patients with LSUV-S.
Multivariate Analysis
Table 5 shows the multivariate analyses to evaluate the
association between surgery and OS and EFS after adjust-

4490

ing for the age effect. Surgery, irrespective of high or low
SUV, appears to play an independent role for OS and
EFS, whereas SUV itself has an independent prognostic
value (translating into a higher rate of events at a later
stage). In this circumstance, the best outcome is noted for
patients with LSUV-S followed by those with HSUV-S,
and the worst outcome is noted for patients with HSUVNS. The most intriguing finding in Table 5 is that, when
surgery was possible, it superseded the impact of SUV on
OS (P ¼ .37) and EFS (P ¼ .2).

DISCUSSION
Surgery plays an important role in the management of
patients with LGC; however, surgery as primary therapy
is reported to result in poor OS rates for patients with
>ypT1 tumors, as demonstrated by Rice et al41 in >4000
patients worldwide who were treated with surgery as their
primary therapy and by Siewert at al,42 who reported on
their own vast experience. Preoperative chemoradiation is
practiced frequently in the United States,5,6,43 even
though, its benefit on OS has not been documented by

any of the trials conducted to date and questions have
been raised regarding the approach.7-11
When patients are congregated into a certain clinical
stage (particularly, stage II or stage III), they are offered
similar therapy (surgery first or multimodality therapy,
depending on the practice culture). This empiric
approach assumes that all patients’ tumors are similar in
their responsiveness to therapy and clinical aggressiveness,
but after therapy is delivered, we notice variable and
unpredictable outcomes. Currently, we do not have any
validated tools with which to optimize therapy for our
patients. However, during therapy, PET studies can discriminate between patients with good and poor prognosis.21-32 We chose to retrospectively examine whether
surgery plays a beneficial role in the group of patients who
are designated to have a poor OS or EFS based on PET
SUV.
The data from the current study are unique because,
by using the combination of postchemoradiation PET
SUV and surgery, we are able to define 3 subgroups
among 204 patients. In these patients, we included 75
patients with LSUV-S to reduce bias in our analysis and
to provide further evidence of the importance of surgery,
even in a group of patients who are designated, by postchemoradiation PET SUV, as having poor survival. We
did not include the fourth group of patients (LSUV-NS)
in this report because an analysis of these patients is presented in another report.33 At our institution, we offer
surgery for patients with LGC after chemoradiation,
when feasible. The long-term strategy for patients with
LGC is often established through a multidisciplinary
interaction. Thus, usually at the outset, we designate a
patient for a bimodality approach (definitive chemoradiation) or a TM approach. However, such decisions are
revisited at various time points and particularly after recovery from chemoradiation (when a full staging is
performed).

Patients who underwent surgery remained at a significantly lower risk of
death or an event.

A few years ago, one would not have been able to
reliably subgroup patient prognosis based solely on endoscopy and CT scans after chemoradiation, but now, with
the advent of PET evaluations, one can group patients
into 2 subgroups. The data from the current study are in
agreement with the literature in that patients can be separated in 2 groups after chemoradiation: those with good
prognosis having a low SUV and those with poor prognosis having a high SUV. However, by adding surgery as a
variable, we were able to create a third subgroup (HSUVS). Our hypothesis is that some patients with HSUV after
chemoradiation (which portends poor prognosis) would
benefit from surgery. This observation emphasizes that
surgery should be revisited in patients with HSUV who
are initially considered borderline for a TM approach and
for those patients with HSUV who are not inclined to
undergo surgery. However, it is unclear and not possible
to determine which patients with HSUV after chemoradiation are likely to have prolonged survival. Perhaps the
use of biomarkers in conjunction with imaging techniques
may sort this out in the future, but it is a challenge.
We also noted that, once the surgery is accomplished
in patients with HSUV or LSUV, the OS curves travel together for approximately 27 months but after that, survival events are more common in the HSUV-S group
compared with the LSUV-S group and the shapes of the
curves for the HSUV-S and HSUV-NS groups are very

similar for events. A similar pattern is noted in the EFS
curves. This suggests that tumors in HSUV patients have
high metastatic potential manifesting later (irrespective of
surgery) compared with those in patients with with
LSUV. In our data, the LSUV-S group did not have a preponderance of pathologic complete responses (pathCRs),
suggesting the inability of PET to correlate with pathCR.
Patients with LSUV represents an interesting group of
patients and demonstrate that the tumor biology as represented by the SUV after chemoradiation has considerable
effect on their prognosis. Such analyses, when combined
with tumor biology and patient genetics, may allow us in
the future to optimize therapy much more effectively than
using a single parameter such as imaging.
The data in the current study suffer from several
shortcomings: 1) the current study is a retrospective
review of events; 2) HSUV patients who did not undergo
surgery were most likely patients who were treated with a
bimodality approach from the outset, but additional
biases incorporated in their management are not known
and therefore were not incorporated in this analysis; and
3) even though the current study is the largest series in the
literature to date, considerable patient heterogeneity exists
and a larger series is desirable. Because these data were retrospective, they provide no guidance in the management
of any patient. We believe data from the current study
need to be confirmed by another group and, more importantly, in a prospective setting.
In conclusion, data from the current study indicate
that, after chemoradiation, LGC patients can be divided
into 3 subgroups and that the poor prognostic group of
patients with HSUV after chemoradiation could be salvaged by surgery. Continued evaluation of PET during
treatment of patients with LGC might provide some
insights as to how to optimize complex and morbid treatments for these individuals.
