ABSTRACT
BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) has been used for treatment of melanomas harboring
V600E mutation. Despite a high initial response rate, resistance to BRAFi is inevitable.
Here, we demonstrate that BRAFi-resistant (BR) melanomas are susceptible to
arginine deprivation due to inability to initiate re-expression of argininosuccinate
synthetase (ASS1, a key enzyme for arginine synthesis) as well as ineffective
autophagy. Autophagy and ASS1 re-expression are known to protect melanoma cells
from cell death upon arginine deprivation. When melanoma cells become BR cells by
long-term in vitro incubation with BRAFi, c-Myc-mediated ASS1 re-expression and
the levels of autophagy-associated proteins (AMPK-a1 and Atg5) are attenuated.
Furthermore, our study uncovers that downregulation of deubiquitinase USP28 which
results in more active c-Myc degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome machinery is the
primary mechanism for inability to re-express ASS1 upon arginine deprivation in BR
cells. Overexpression of USP28 in BR cells enhances c-Myc expression and hence
increases ASS1 transcription upon arginine deprivation, and consequently leads to
cell survival. On the other hand, overexpression of Atg5 or AMPK-a1 in BR cells can
redirect arginine deprivation-induced apoptosis toward autophagy. The xenograft
models also confirm that BR tumors possess lower expression of ASS1 and are
hypersensitive to arginine deprivation. These biochemical changes in BRAFi resistance
which make them vulnerable to arginine deprivation can be exploited for the future
treatment of BR melanoma patients.

combined BRAFi and MEK inhibitor (MEKi). While
the response rate is high (80%), resistance is inevitable
and usually occurs within 12 months [3]. Hence,
salvage therapy is urgently needed to treat these patients
who failed BRAFi/MEKi. Immunotherapy, such as

anti-CTLA4 antibody (ipillumamab) or anti-PD-1
antibody (nivolumab), has been shown to have anti-tumor
activity in melanoma patients who failed chemotherapy,
and triplet arm treatment (immunotherapy, BRAFi, and
MEKi) has been done in a phase I clinical trial but was
discontinued due to unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity
[4, 5]. The activity of these immunotherapies in BRAF/
MEK inhibition failure remains unknown.
Currently, the major aberrant mechanisms leading to
acquired resistance to BRAFi have been identified which
include mutation of RAS, overexpression of CRAF, COT,
PDGFRβ, and IGF-1R [6-9]. These mechanisms result in
constitutive activation/phosphorylation of downstream
molecules including ERK and AKT. Heterogeneous
resistant mechanisms in the same tumor or different
tumors in the same patient increase the difficulties to target
a specific alternative pathway [10, 11]. In this study, we
provide a different strategy to treat BR tumors by targeting
the bioenergetic vulnerability shared by the majority of
BR tumors regardless of the alternative pathways they use
to circumvent BRAF inhibition.
Previously, we have reported that most melanoma
cells (60-80%) do not express or express very low levels of
argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) [12], a key enzyme
in urea cycle needed to synthesize arginine from citrulline
[13]. Hence, ASS1 negative (-) melanoma cells require
exogenous arginine to maintain normal cellular function.
We and others have shown that arginine deiminase (ADIPEG20, kindly provided by Polaris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.),
a mycoplasma enzyme degrading arginine to citrulline
and ammonia, is active against multiple ASS1 (-) tumors
including melanoma [13]. However, ASS1 re-expression
and autophagy impair its antitumor activity [14, 15].
Combination treatments to abort autophagy and redirect
the cells to apoptosis are being developed to circumvent
these mechanisms [14, 16, 17].
Our previous study showed that ASS1 expression
is positively regulated by c-Myc but negatively regulated
by HIF-1α in melanoma cells [18]. Inducible ASS1
transcription upon arginine deprivation is primary a
consequence of PI3K/AKT/ERK activation which
enhances stability of c-Myc via downregulation of GSK3β-phosphorylated c-Myc at Thr58 and upregulation of
phosphorylated c-Myc (Ser62) [15, 19]. Additionally, a
deubiquitinase, USP28, has been reported to antagonize
ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of c-Myc.
Elevated c-Myc overwhelms HIF-1α to bind E-box
(enhancer box) in ASS1 promoter, and collaborates with
transcription factor SP4 binding to GC box to initiate
ASS1 transcription in melanoma cells [18]. When ASS1
is up-regulated, cells can synthesize arginine and not
depend on exogenous arginine, resulting in ADI-PEG20
resistance.
Autophagy is known to emerge when cancer cells
encounter nutrient stresses, chemotherapeutic agents,
and protein kinase inhibitors [20] and is one of the major
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanisms leading to resistance. Arginine deprivation
has been shown to induce autophagy through AMPK
activation [21] which can negate its antitumor activity.
Activated AMPK can directly activate ULK complex or
through mTOR inhibition and in turn trigger formation of
Atg-5-Atg12 complex and LC3-I/LC3-II conversion [12,
20, 22]. On the other hand, mutant BRAF (V600E) has
been reported to constitutively phosphorylate ERK which
can phosphorylate LKB1 directly or indirectly through
ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and subsequently suppress
LKB1 capability to activate AMPK in melanomas [23,
24]. AMPK protein per se can be degraded by ubiquitinproteasome machinery [25]. Overall, the LKB1-AMPK
axis, which is a master energy sensor regulating cell
proliferation and survival through autophagy during
nutrient stress, can be modulated by ERK activation and
proteasomal degradation.
In this study, we found that BRAFi resistance
abrogates ASS1 re-expression and autophagy, which are
two vital mechanisms for survival when parental cells
encounter arginine deprivation [18, 21]. Abrogation
of ASS1 re-expression is most likely due to increased
c-Myc degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome machinery,
and downregulation of autophagy is due to a decrease in
autophagy-associated proteins. Overall, these findings
suggest that arginine deprivation/ ADI-PEG20 can be
applied as a salvage therapy for patients who fail BRAFi
treatment.

RESULTS
BRAFi-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are more
sensitive to arginine deprivation compared with
parental cells
We have established BR cells from six parental cell
lines (A375, A2058, MEL-1220, SK-MEL-28, MEL-GP,
and UACC-62) which harbor BRAF (V600E) mutation.
All parental cell lines were constantly exposed to
vemurafenib at IC50 over 30 weeks. To confirm whether
they become BRAFi resistant, both parental and BR cells
were treated with different concentrations of vemurafenib
for 72 hr, and IC50 values of BRAFi were assessed by
MTT assay. The result revealed that IC50 values of BR
cell lines were 2-10 fold higher than those of parental cell
lines (Table 1).
To investigate whether BR cells are sensitive to
arginine deprivation, parental and BR cells were treated
with ADI-PEG20 (an arginine degrading enzyme) and
cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay. As shown in
Figure 1A and Table 1, the IC50 values of ADI-PEG20
of BR cell lines (A375BR, MEL-1220BR, A2058BR,
SK-MEL-28BR, and UACC-62BR) were approximately
2.5-fold lower than their parental cell lines. The IC50
values of ADI-PEG20 in MEL-GP and MEL-GPBR
were not reached due to the fact that MEL-GP has

was able to inhibit about 20% proliferation in MELGPBR cells but had no effect on parental cells (Figure 1A
and Figure 5A). Overall, our data indicated that BR cells

of Noxa were highest in all BR cells after ADI-PEG 20
treatment, whereas anti-apoptotic proteins declined in
BR cells following ADI-PEG20 treatment (Figure 1C).
Importantly, the Bax/Bcl2 ratio known to be regulated by
Noxa and reflect BH3 protein ability to trigger caspase-3
activation and cytochrome c release [26] was significantly
higher in BR cells compared to the untreated control and
parental cells treated with ADI-PEG20 (Figure 1D). Thus,
alterations of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins
favoring apoptosis most likely contribute to the apoptotic
effect of ADI-PEG20 in BR cells.
Our previous studies demonstrated that ADI-PEG20
is able to trigger autophagy, which precludes parental
melanoma cells from undergoing apoptosis and prolongs
cell survival [14, 21]. To confirm whether ADI-PEG20
induces apoptosis by evading autophagy in BR cells, we
compared the autophagosome formation and autophagy
associated proteins in parental and BR cells upon arginine
deprivation/ADI-PEG20 treatment. The result showed that
ADI-PEG20 induced 45-90% autophagosome formation in
parental cells but less than 25% autophagosome formation in
BR cells (Figure 2A-B). The TEM images further depicted
that ADI-PEG20 treatment resulted in increased numbers of
autophagosomes in cytoplasm of A2058 cells (arrowheads),
while organelle fragmentation and enlarged vacuoles which
are indicative of apoptosis were seen in A2058BR cells
(asterisks) (Figure 2C). Furthermore, another autophagic
marker, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, was seen in parental
cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20, but not in BR cells
(Figure 2D, and Supplementary Figure 6). Taken together,
our data confirmed that ADI-PEG20 induces autophagy in
parental cells but apoptosis in BR cells.

Arginine deprivation induces apoptosis instead
of autophagy in BRAFi-resistant (BR) cells
Since BR cells are hypersensitive to arginine
deprivation, we proceeded to study whether cell death
also occurs. Based on IC50 values of ADI-PEG20, we
treated all cell lines with ADI-PEG20 (100 ng/ml) for 72
hr and then examined for apoptosis. The result depicted
that ADI-PEG20 treatment notably showed an increase in
Annexin V-positive BR cell proportion when compared
to their parental cell counterparts (Figure 1B and Table
1). In addition, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 were
also detected in all three BR cells but only in one parental
cell line A375, which is known to be sensitive to arginine
deprivation (Figure 1C) [16, 21]. Addition of pan caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK also rescued BR cells from ADIPEG20-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 1), and
confirmed that ADI-PEG20 induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis. We further examined the levels of pro-apoptotic
(Noxa and Bax) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and
XIAP) which may contribute to the apoptotic effect of
ADI-PEG20. These proteins were chosen since they have
been shown to be affected by ADI-PEG20 treatment from
our previous study [16]. The result revealed that the levels

(Figure 2D). It has been reported that BRAF-mediated

through phosphorylation at Ser428, and subsequently
inhibits activation and phosphorylation of AMPK [23].

present and was not related to protein levels of p-LKB1
(Ser428) (Figure 2D). Instead, the levels of p-AMPK
(Thr172) correlated with the levels of AMPK-α1 which
possess (Thr172) phosphorylation site. Based on this
result, we hypothesized that the inability to undergo
autophagy following ADI-PEG20 treatment is primarily
due to decreased levels of AMPK-α1. To verify this
hypothesis, BR cells were transfected with the plasmids
containing AMPK-α1 (PRKAA1) to compensate for

insufficient endogenous AMPK-α1, and then treated with
ADI-PEG20. The result revealed that overexpression of
AMPK-α1 in MEL-1220BR and A2058BR cells resulted
in robust autophagosome formation and decreased
apoptosis as well as reduced growth inhibitory effect by
15-30% after ADI-PEG20 treatment compared to vehicle
control (Figure 3A-E).
In addition to downregulation of AMPK-α1, the
levels of downstream molecule of autophagy, Atg5, were

also lower in BR cells compared to those in parental
cells (Figure 2D). To examine whether Atg5 governs
vulnerability to ADI-PEG20, MEL-1220BR and A2058BR
cells were transfected with plasmids inserted with Atg5.
As shown in Fig. 4A-D, over-expressed Atg5 increased
10-30% viability and rescued 12-35% apoptosis in BR
cells through increased autophagy as evidenced by

more autophagosome formation in BR cells following
incubation with arginine-free medium (Figure 4E).
Previously, several studies have proven that BRAFi
treatment can trigger ER stress-mediated autophagy which
gives rise to BRAFi resistance [27], but BR cells created
by long-term incubation with BRAFi in this study have
insufficient AMPK-α1 and Atg5 and inactive autophagy.

To verify this discrepancy, we did a 20-week time course
study on the alterations of p-AMPK, AMPK-α1 and Atg5
after continuous exposure to BRAFi to mimic the clinical
course when patients received BRAFi treatment. The
results showed that p-AMPK, AMPK-α1, Atg5, and LC-3II
increased during day 5 to day 15, yet they were attenuated
after 55 days (Supplementary Figure 2). Notably, our time
course study recapitulated the notion that these autophagyassociated proteins were down-regulated when melanoma
cells entirely turned into BR cells.

ASS1 transcription (Supplementary Figure 3). Taken
together, our data demonstrated that suppressed ASS1
transcription is mainly mediated by attenuated c-Myc in
BR cells.
Since low c-Myc levels seen in BR cells may be due
to decreased transcription, we detected RNA levels using
qRT-PCR and found no association with protein levels
(data not shown). Thus, we hypothesized that more active
ubiquitin-proteasome machinery of these proteins occurs
in BR cells. To validate this hypothesis, we determined the
levels of these proteins upon treatment with proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 or a protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX). The results showed that all three
BR cell lines had delayed accumulation of c-Myc following
treatment with MG-132 (Supplementary Figure 4).
Subsequent to treatment with CHX, c-Myc levels declined
faster in BR cells than parental cells. To further determine
whether more active ubiquitination of these two proteins
appears in BR cells, ubiquitin co-immunoprecipitated
with c-Myc was detected by immunoblotting. The results
showed that higher levels of ubiquitin binding to c-Myc are
present in BR cells, relative to parental cells, even in the
presence of ADI-PEG20 (Figure 5D).
It has been reported that USP28 is a potent
deubiquitinase to facilitate c-Myc stabilization [28], and
down-regulated USP28 appeared in all BR cells (Figure 5A
and Supplementary Figure 6). Hence, we hypothesized that
attenuation of USP28 may play a role in c-Myc degradation
seen in BR cells. To examine this hypothesis, the plasmid
containing Flag-USP28 was delivered into A2058BR cells.
Overexpression of USP28 resulted in an increase in c-Myc
protein levels due to less ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation (Supplementary Figure 5). Increased c-Myc
bound to promoter of ASS1 gene (ASS1 transcription) and
resulted in increased ASS1 protein in A2058BR-USP28
cells following treatment with ADI-PEG20 (Figure 5E-G).

Downregulation of USP28 results in attenuation
of c-Myc-mediated ASS1 transcription which
increases sensitivity to arginine deprivation in
BR cells
As mentioned, c-Myc mediated ASS1 re-expression
is a major contributory factor hampering the antitumor
effect of ADI-PEG20. As shown in Figure 5A and 5C,
following ADI-PEG20 treatment, ASS1 and c-Myc levels
were notably robust in parental A2058, MEL-GP, and SKMEL-28 cells, but decreased in BR cells. To substantiate
this finding, we determined activity of c-Myc binding to
promoter (E-box) of ASS1 with the plasmid PGL3 inserted
with E-box and luciferase gene. As shown in Figure 5B, a
2-2.5-fold increase in induced luciferase activity was seen
in parental cells, whereas only a 1.2-1.5-fold increase
was seen in BR cells. In parental cell lines (A375 and
MEL-1220) with non-inducible ASS1 expression, c-Myc
protein levels were increased upon ADI-PEG20 treatment;
however, attenuated c-Myc levels were still seen when they
became BR cells (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 6).
Furthermore, the results of time course experiment also
reiterated that both ASS1 and c-Myc were down-regulated
simultaneously in A2058 cells after exposure to BRAFi
(Supplementary Figure 2). Previous data showed that
ASS1 induction upon ADI-PEG20 treatment is mediated
through PI3K/Akt and ERK activation in A2058 cells
[15]. Activated Akt phosphorylates GSK-3β at Ser9 and
inhibits its ability to phosphorylate c-Myc at Thr58 (the
site inducing c-Myc degradation). Meanwhile, activated
ERK directly phosphorylates c-Myc at Ser62 to stabilize
c-Myc [15, 18]. Consistent with previous study, ADIPEG20 treatment increased the ratio of Ser62 to Thr58
and in turn enhanced c-Myc stability leading to ASS1
expression in parental cells. In BR cells, low levels of
c-Myc did not correlate with p-c-Myc (the ratio of Ser62/
Thr58), and GSK-3β (Figure 5A). Thus, other factors may
be involved in governing c-Myc stability. Our previous
study showed that HIF-1α competes with c-Myc to bind
to ASS1 promoter and impedes its transcription [18]. To
clarify whether HIF-1α suppresses ASS1 transcription
in BR cells, we treated both parental and BR cells with
hypoxia-mimetic cobalt chloride (CoCl2) or proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 to abort HIF-1α degradation. The results
revealed that HIF-1α expression was too low to terminate

In-vivo models confirm arginine deprivationinduced apoptosis and attenuated ASS1
re-expression in BR tumors
The results of xenograft model showed that ADIPEG20 treatment retarded tumor growth of A2058
and A375 cells, and entirely aborted tumor growth in
A2058BR and A375BR cells (Figure 6A). The T/C
(treatment/control) ratios in A2058BR and A375BR cells
were lower than those in A2058 and A375 cells (A375
vs. A375BR is 26.7% vs. 11.8%; A2058 vs. A2058BR is
38.7% vs. 8.3%). Furthermore, elevated cleaved caspase-3
expression was also found in tumor tissues from A375BRand A2058BR-bearing mice treated with ADI-PEG20
(Figure 6B). Importantly, consistent with our in-vitro
data, the attenuated ASS1 re-expression was present in
A2058BR xenograft tumors and ASS1 expression was
negative in A375/A375BR xenograft tumors (Figure 5A
and 6C).

seen in BRAFi/MEKi resistant (BMR) cells (Figure 2D
and 5A, and Supplementary Figure 7). Importantly, ADIPEG20 treatment induced 35-45% apoptosis instead of
autophagy, without induction of ASS1 (Supplementary
Figure 7). Moreover, the levels of USP28 and c-Myc
were also attenuated in BMR cells. Thus, our results
demonstrated that arginine deprivation therapy can also
be applied to treat BMR melanomas.

and is inducible in parental cells in arginine depleted
conditions [18]. However, in certain melanoma cell lines,
such as MEL-1220 cells, epigenetic silencing does play
a role in ASS1 expression as evidenced by the result that
non-inducible ASS1 is seen in parental cells. On the other
hand, in A375 cells, the tight binding of HIF-1α, which
cannot be displaced by c-Myc, does play an important
role in non-inducible ASS1[18]. In contrast to parental
cells, BR cells have very low levels of both HIF-1α and
c-Myc. The lower levels of HIF-1α also correspond with
published data which indicate that BRAFi treatment
drives the cells toward oxidative phosphorylation [35].
Unlike parental cells, the protein levels of c-Myc in BR
cells are so low that they cannot efficiently upregulate
ASS1 transcription even under arginine deprivation.
Attenuation of c-Myc is primarily due to a decrease in
deubiquitination and is not related to two phosphorylation
sites (Thr58/Ser62). Two deubiquitinases (USP28 and
USP36) have been reported to govern c-Myc stability
[28, 36]. We found a substantial reduction in USP28 with
no significant difference in USP36 between parental and
BR cells (data not shown). Currently, the mechanism
that USP28 interacts with c-Myc and antagonizes c-Myc
degradation is controversial. Several studies suggested
that certain types of ubiquitin ligase (Fbw7) are recruited
by phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58, bridge USP28 and
c-Myc interaction, and enhance the ability of USP28 to
remove the ubiquitin from c-Myc [28, 37]. However, our
finding shows that down-regulation of USP28 in BR cells
attenuates c-Myc stability in a phosphorylation (Thr58/
Ser62) site-independent manner, which is in agreement
with other studies supporting that USP28 can directly
bind to c-Myc in the absence of F-box protein Fbw7 [38].
Additionally, according to the study by Popov, et al.,
depletion of USP28 in HeLa and LS174T cells can inhibit
cell growth and proliferation due to its inability to enhance
c-Myc stability [28]. This finding may explain why BR
tumors in vivo grow more slowly than their parental
tumors (Figure 6A). Taken together, USP28 is likely to
govern not only ASS1 re-expression but also proliferation
in BR cells. Downregulation of c-Myc via proteasomal
regulation in BR cells may also have other metabolic
consequence and correlate with the recent data showing
that BR cells use oxidative phosphorylation rather than
glycolysis as their energy source [39].
The energy sensing LKB1-AMPK axis has been
shown to be suppressed by BRAF-ERK activation
[23, 24]. In BRAF (V600E) mutant melanoma, two
phosphorylation sites of LKB (Ser325 and Ser 428),
which are crucial for regulation of AMPK activation,
are constitutively phosphorylated by ERK and RSK.
However, upon treatment with BRAFi, p-AMPK is
activated and autophagy occurs most likely through
inhibition of ERK and as a mechanism to evade
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 2). As discussed
earlier, it has been shown that BRAFi triggers autophagy

DISCUSSION
At present, there is no FDA approved drug to treat
patients who failed BRAFi or BRAFi/MEKi. Targeting
alternative pathways in BR tumors is also difficult due to
tumor heterogeneity and the response may also be shortlived [10]. Non-specific inhibitors such as HSP90 inhibitor
and CDK4/6 inhibitor have been shown to have antitumor
activity in BR tumors in vitro and in animal models [2931], but the clinical activity is as yet unknown. Recently
it was reported that ER stress-mediated autophagy is also
a mechanism of BRAFi resistance [32]. Combination of
BRAFi with hydroxychloroquine (autophagy inhibitor)
is suggested to further improve the therapeutic efficacy
of BRAFi [27]. Similar to these findings, our time course
study shows that melanoma cells undergo autophagy as
a survival mechanism when they first encounter BRAFi
(Supplemental Figure 2). Nevertheless, we found
that BRAFi initially triggers autophagic flux and then
attenuates the levels of autophagy-associated proteins
(AMPK-α1, Atg5, and LC3-II) over time. This result
suggests that these cells initiate proliferation and hence
abandon autophagy after they completely adapt to
inhibitors. Importantly, it also corresponds to the clinical
finding that patients who failed BRAFi treatment often
have rapid disease progression [7, 11].
In this report, we have discovered that all BR cells
are exquisitely sensitive to arginine deprivation and
arginine deprivation treatment leads to apoptosis instead
of autophagy through multiple mechanisms. Firstly,
attenuation of autophagy occurs in BR cells as mentioned
above. Secondly, BR cells have elevated levels of the proapoptotic protein Noxa and low levels of anti-apoptotic
proteins including XIAP and Bcl-2 when treated with
ADI-PEG20 (Figure 1C), which favors apoptosis. Thirdly,
ASS1 re-expression upon ADI-PEG20 treatment is downregulated which results in vulnerability to ADI-PEG20
treatment. Thus, we have utilized several experiments to
elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
ASS1 transcription is governed by many
mechanisms and may depend on tumor cell types.
Epigenetic ASS1 gene silencing via DNA methylation
has been reported in mesothelioma and other cancers
[33, 34] and is not inducible. The mechanisms leading to
methylation of ASS1 gene remain unknown. In melanoma,
ASS1 transcription is primarily governed by c-Myc (a
positive regulator) and HIF-1α (a negative regulator)

via ER stress [27]. It is possible that inhibition of ERK
and activation of ER stress contribute to autophagy
upon treatment with BRAFi. When melanoma cells
become BRAFi resistant, lower levels of p-AMPK may
be governed by downregulation of AMPK-α1. Our data
also demonstrate that overexpression of AMPK-α1
in BR cells indeed can reduce apoptosis and increase
autophagy. This finding supports the notion that downregulated AMPK-α1 mainly influences phosphorylation
of AMPK (Thr172) (Figure 2D and Figure 3) which
regulates autophagy. Additionally, we also assayed
RNA levels of AMPK-α1 in both parental and BR cells
and found no correlation with protein levels (data not
shown). These results suggest that downregulation
of AMPK- α1 in BR cells may be through ubiquitindependent proteasomal degradation.
In addition to down-regulated AMPK seen in BR
cells, Atg5 is also attenuated in BR cells, which can impair
elongation of autophagic membrane. On the other hand,
Atg5 can be cleaved by calpain and trigger apoptosis [40,
41]. We found only full length of Atg5 (32KDa) but not
cleaved Atg5 (~24KDa) is down-regulated in BR cells,
even in the presence of ADI-PEG20. Overexpressed Atg5

can partially restore ADI-PEG20-induced autophagy
and prevent BR cells from apoptosis (Figure 4). This is
expected since AMPK levels remain low in these Atg5
transfected cells.
In summary, melanoma cells, in the process of
protecting themselves from the cytotoxic effect of
BRAFi, first utilize autophagy to survive and gradually
initiate alternative pathways to activate ERK and/or other
downstream growth signaling pathway(s). Once they
survive and become BR cells, they start to proliferate and
abrogate autophagic flux by decreasing AMPK-α1 and
Atg5. These alterations together with the inability to turn
on ASS1 expression make them extremely vulnerable to
arginine deprivation (Figure 7). It is possible that the cells
in tumor microenvironment, such as endothelial cells, can
provide arginine and abrogate the effect of ADI-PEG20;
however, hypersensitivity to ADI-PEG20 is clearly seen
in vivo which suggests that tumor microenvironment may
not play a major role in abrogating ADI-PEG20 effect seen
in BR cells. Overall, our data elucidate that degrading
arginine using ADI-PEG20 could be a promising non-toxic
salvage therapy in both BRAFi and/ or MEKi- resistant
melanomas.

Figure 7: The schematic diagram illustrates the two mechanisms leading to sensitivity to arginine deprivation/ ADIPEG20. In parental cells, ASS1 re-expression and autophagy attenuate ADI-PEG20 efficacy resulting in cell survival. In BR cells,

downregulation of c-Myc via ubiquitin-proteasome degradation and attenuated AMPK-α1 respectively result in inability to initiate ASS1
transcription and undergo autophagy, and hence increase sensitivity to ADI-PEG20. Downregulation of USP28 is accountable for c-Myc
degradation and suppresion of ASS1 transcription.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR analysis for
detection of AMPK-α1, and c-Myc using SYBR green
supermix reagent and real-time PCR machine (CFX96,
Bio-Rad). The levels of these genes were normalized by
GAPDH levels. Their primer sequences were described in
supplementary Table 1.

Cell lines and reagents
The BRAFi-resistant (BR) cell lines were established
from SK-MEL28, MEL-GP, A375, MEL-1220, UACC62 and A2058 cells possessing V600E mutation. The
parental cell lines including A375, A2058, UACC62, and
SK-MEL28 were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), and MEL-1220 and MEL-GP were
established in our laboratory. To establish BR cells, these
parental cells were incubated with BRAFi (vemurafenib,
PLX4032) or BRAFi/ MEKi (trametinib, GSK1120212)
(Selleck Chemicals) at IC50 over 30 weeks. All cell lines
were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS
(Atlanta Biologicals, Inc) and streptomycin/penicillin in
CO2 incubator. The arginine-free medium was generated by
adding ADI-PEG20 (100 ng/ml, Polaris Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.) in complete MEM medium at 37°C over 24 hr.
To investigate the mechanism of proteasomal
degradation, we treated the parental and BR cells with
either a proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Selleck Chemicals)
or an inhibitor of protein synthesis (cyclohexmide, Sigma)
to observe the turnover of c-Myc. Hypoxia mimetic agent
CoCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in complete medium
and used to treat the cells for detection of HIF-1α expression.

Transfection of plasmids and promoter/
luciferase activity assays
Plasmid PGL-AS-85 was provided by Dr. Macus
T. Kuo [18]. Luciferase activity assay was accomplished
by cells transfected with mixture of plasmid PGL3AS-85 (containing E-box) and lipofectamine (Invitrogen)
for 6 hr and then cultured in arginine-free medium for
24 hr. The activity of c-Myc binding to promoter was
determined by luciferase assay system kit (Promega) and
normalized by total protein. Overexpression of USP28
was accomplished using a plasmid containing Flag-USP28
(pDZ-Flag-USP28) (Addgene, Inc). The GFP containing
plasmids inserted with Atg5, or AMPK-α1 (PRKAA1)
were purchased from Addgene and OriGene, respectively.
Subsequent to transfection of these plasmids with
lipofectamine, GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS
Arial I sorter (BD Biosciences).

Cell viability assay

Antibodies for immunoblotting

Prior to ADI-PEG20 treatment, BR melanoma cells
were cultured in the absence of vemurafenib for 24 hr. 5
x 103 melanoma cells were cultured with various doses of
ADI-PEG20 for 72 hr. The cell proliferation was analyzed
by MTT (Sigma-Aldrich), which has been described in
previous study [42].

Antibodies against HIF-1α, c-Myc, USP28,
ubiquitin (Ub), AMPK-α1, AMPK-α2, AMPK, phosphoAMPK (Thr172), Caspase-3, GSK-3β, phospho-GSK-3β
(Ser9), XIAP, Beclin-1, p-LKB (S428), ULK (S555) and
LC3-I/II were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
The rest of the antibodies, such as anti-Atg5, antiphospho-c-Myc (Thr58), anti-phospho-c-Myc (Ser62),
LKB and anti-ASS1 were respectively purchased from
Abgent, Santa Cruz Biotech, Abcam, and kindly provided
by Polaris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The immunoblots were
visualized by ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad) and
quantitation was performed by densitometer and Image J.

Analyses of apoptosis and autophagy
Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V and PI kit
(Abd Serotec), and tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester dye
(TMRE, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The apoptotic proportion was analyzed
by Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To
confirm whether ADI-PGE20-induced cell apoptosis
is caspase dependent, the cells were treated with pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (20 μM, Santa Cruz) in
the presence of ADI-PEG20, stained with Annexin V/PI,
and analyzed by flow cytometry FACS. For detection of
autophagosomes, cyto-ID autophagy detection kit (Enzo
Life Sciences) and Lyso Tracker Red (Life Technologies)
were applied to this experiment.

BRAF mutation analysis
Total DNA was isolated from melanoma cells using
DNeasy blood & tissue kit (Qiagen). The BRAF mutation
in DNA samples (50 ng/μl) was determined using BRAF
V600E mutation analysis kit (EntroGen) and iCycler iQ™
real-time PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad). The
protocol for detection followed the instructions of the
manufacturer.

Immunoprecipitation

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis

Briefly, immunoprecipitation was completed by
addition of anti-c-Myc (Cell Singling Technology) and
Gammabind plus sepharose bead slurry (GE Healthcare)
into the protein samples. Immunoprecipitants were
collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

For RNA detection, total RNA was extracted by
trizole reagent (Life Technologies) and converted into
cDNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).

using Prism. All results of in-vitro studies were shown as
mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Every result was
performed by three independent experiments. P-value <
0.05 was regarded as significant difference.

The procedures and protocol of mice were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Miami VA medical center. Female athymic
nude-Foxn1nu mice (6-8 weeks, Harlan Laboratories) were
inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 cells prepared in
physiologic buffered saline (PBS), respectively. When
the tumor volumes reached 100 mm3, the treatment group
received intramuscular injection of ADI-PEG20 (100 IU/
kg) twice per week, and control group was saline only.
The formula of tumor volume was (length x width2)/2.
Tumor growth inhibition was calculated as median of
tumor volume in treatment group to that in control group
(T/C) ratio. NCI standard of the T/C ratio is < 42% which
indicates significant tumor growth inhibition.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Cell pellets were acquired and immediately fixed in
neutral buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature.
The specimens were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide
(OsO4) for 10 minutes, dehydrated using a graded ethanol
series, en bloc stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50%
ethanol for 30 minutes, and embedded in Spurr’s epoxy
resin. Tumor samples were also embedded in a similar
fashion described for cell cultures, except post-fixation
staining with OsO4 and embedding with Spurr’s resin
was lengthened to account for the larger cell volume in
tumor tissue. Semi-thin (1 μm) and ultra-thin (< 90 nm)
sections were cut using a Diatome 3 mm diamond knife
on the Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome. Semi-thin sections
were stained with toluidine blue and examined using an
Olympus BX60 light microscope with a digital camera
(Olympus DP71). All ultra-thin sections were stained
using lead citrate to be viewed under TEM with a Jeol
1400 EM at 80 kV.
