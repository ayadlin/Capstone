Cell Cycle–Dependent Mechanisms Underlie
Vincristine-Induced Death of Primary Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells
Anisha Kothari1, Walter N. Hittelman2, and Timothy C. Chambers1

Abstract
Microtubule-targeting agents (MTA), such as the taxanes and
vinca alkaloids, are used to treat a variety of cancers due to their
ability to perturb microtubule dynamics. In cell culture, MTAs
exert their anticancer effects primarily by causing mitotic arrest
and cell death. However, accumulating indirect evidence suggests
that MTAs may exert their cytotoxicity in human tumors by
interfering with interphase microtubules. In this study, we sought
to develop and characterize an experimental system in which to
test the hypothesis that MTAs induce cell death during interphase.
Primary adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells treated
with vincristine only weakly exhibited colocalization between
mitotic and apoptotic markers and major characteristics of mitotic
death, such as an increase in cells with 4N DNA content before the
appearance of cells with <2N DNA content, suggesting a mixed

response. Therefore, we separated ALL cells into distinct phases
of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation, labeled cells with
5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU), and then treated each population with vincristine. Cells isolated during G1 underwent cell
death without evidence of EdU uptake, indicating that the
cytotoxic effects of vincristine took place during G1. Conversely,
cells isolated during S or G2–M phases underwent death following mitotic arrest. Thus, vincristine induces distinct death
programs in primary ALL cells depending on cell-cycle phase,
and cells in G1 are particularly susceptible to perturbation
of interphase microtubules. Primary ALL cells may therefore
provide a powerful model system in which to study the
multimodal mechanisms underlying MTA-induced cell death.

Introduction

kinase 1 (Cdk1)/cyclin B1-mediated Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation acts as a functional link coupling mitotic arrest and cell
death (9), and that cell fate after mitotic arrest is dictated by the
degree of Cdk1/cyclin B1–mediated phosphorylation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (10).
Implicit in conventional theories of MTA action is that they
induce mitotic arrest prior to cell death. This viewpoint has
recently been challenged, on the basis of largely indirect evidence but nonetheless compelling lines of reasoning (11, 12).
The major points underlying this paradigm shift include the
following: (i) all of the mechanistic data derive from cell
culture and xenograft models, which may not recapitulate
patient tumor conditions; (ii) there is a poor relationship
between the status of the spindle assembly checkpoint and
cellular sensitivity to MTAs (6); (iii) MTAs are effective clinically despite the slow doubling times and low mitotic indices of
some human tumors (11–13); and (iv) mitosis-speciﬁc inhibitors, such as those targeting Aurora kinases and polo-like
kinases, are effective in vitro but have shown poor activity in
clinical trials (11–13). Such collective evidence has led to the
suggestion that the therapeutic efﬁcacy of MTAs in the clinical
setting may be attributed to interference with interphase microtubule functions (11, 12). This viewpoint has itself been questioned, resulting in an intense current debate (14–17). For
example, it has been suggested that the slow doubling time
of tumors likely reﬂects the balance of proliferation and death,
and thus cycling cells may be more abundant than predicted
based solely on doubling time (14). In addition, it has been
contended that since drugs such as taxol are concentrated and
retained in tumor cells for lengthy periods, their effects may be
exerted on quiescent cells that reenter the cycle after a prolonged delay (13, 18, 19).

Microtubule targeting agents (MTA) are clinically important
chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of various cancers
(1). MTAs act by interfering with microtubule dynamics, which
plays a major role in mitotic spindle formation. MTAs such as the
vinca alkaloids, including vincristine, cause microtubule depolymerization, whereas taxanes stabilize microtubules preventing
their depolymerization (2). Treatment of cultured cells with MTAs
often leads to prolonged activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, leading to mitotic arrest and eventually cell death, providing a rationale for their use as antitumor agents (3–5). Cells may
die in mitosis or exit mitosis without proper chromosome segregation or cytokinesis, referred to as mitotic slippage. After
slippage, cells may die in interphase, or arrest and survive, or
resume cycling (6, 7). Whether cells die in mitosis or undergo
mitotic slippage has been postulated to depend on the balance of
two pathways, one controlling cyclin B1 levels and the other
caspase activation (8). We have reported that cyclin-dependent

Kothari et al.

Rapid induction of interphase death by vinca alkaloids has
been reported in a limited number of cell lines, but generally only
with relatively high drug concentrations or in combination with
other drugs (20–23). A study of breast cancer cell lines treated with
microtubule destabilizers reported arrest in G1 and G2 phases,
suggesting the drugs may perturb cells in interphase, but the
subsequent fate of the treated cells was not examined (24).
Because MTAs typically manifest their effects in mitosis in most
cultured cell lines, a major obstacle to progress in this area is the
lack of appropriate laboratory models of MTA-induced interphase
death.
To develop and characterize a cell system to test the hypothesis
that MTAs could also induce interphase death, we assessed the
extent of mitotic arrest in several different cell types after MTA
treatment. Among these were primary adult acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) cells derived from several individual adult
patients, expanded, and established in culture using a deﬁned
serum-free medium (25, 26). In the current study, to determine
whether cells in different cell-cycle contexts were differentially
affected by vincristine, we used centrifugal elutriation to isolate
populations of ALL cells in different cell-cycle phases. We show
that vincristine can induce cell death directly in G1 phase cells,
whereas cells beyond G1 phase transit to M-phase before undergoing cell death. Thus, vincristine induces distinct cell-cycle–
dictated pathways of cell death in primary ALL cells. To our
knowledge, these results are the ﬁrst to deﬁnitively demonstrate
induction of interphase death by relatively low and therapeutically relevant concentrations of an MTA used alone, and, as such,
provide a powerful model system to study clinically applicable
death mechanisms induced by drugs in this class and to provide
hypotheses to explore in vivo.

Materials and Methods
For materials, cell extraction and immunoblotting, cell-cycle
analysis, analysis of microtubule content, and Statistical analysis,
see Supplementary Materials.
Cell culture
KB3 cells (HeLa subline) were maintained in DMEM, and
RS4;11 ALL cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium, each
supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin.
ALL cell cultures were maintained in suspension as described
previously (25) in Iscove's modiﬁed Dulbecco's medium
(IMDM) containing serum-free supplement (10 mg/mL cholesterol, 6 mg/mL human serum albumin, 0.5 mg/mL amphotericin, 1 mg/mL insulin, 200 mg/mL human apo-transferrin,
50 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and
50 U/mL penicillin). Cells were maintained at 37 C and 5%
CO2. The ALL cultures utilized, namely ALL-2 and ALL-5,
correspond to their original designations of CM and PH cells,
respectively (25). Doubling time was determined by monitoring viable cell count daily for up to 6 days. Authentication of
the cell lines and ALL cultures was established via short tandem
repeat (STR) proﬁling in September, 2014, by Genetica DNA
Laboratories (LabCorp Specialty Testing Group). The STR proﬁles of KB3 and RS4;11 cell lines matched that of reference
proﬁles available in the ATCC database, and, as expected, the
two primary ALL cell cultures each gave unique proﬁles that did
not match any in the repository.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (27). Cells (2,000 per well for KB3 and 30,000 per well for
others) were seeded in 96-well plates, and vincristine was added in
a ﬁxed ﬁnal concentration of 0.1% DMSO. After incubating for a
time period equivalent to twice their doubling time (see Table 1),
MTT reagent (50 mg/10 mL/well) was added and incubated overnight at 37 C. The next day, 0.1 mL of 10% SDS in 0.01 mol/L HCl
was added, and after overnight incubation, absorbance readings
were taken at 540 nm.
Centrifugal elutriation
Centrifugal elutriation was performed using a Beckman JE-6
elutriator rotor as described previously (28). Cells (3.5–4  108)
were suspended in 20-mL elutriation buffer (Hank's buffered
salt solution containing 1.6 g/L 2-naphthol-6,8-disulfonic acid
dipotassium salt and 2% calf serum), passed through a 25G
needle twice, and introduced into the chamber at a ﬂow rate
of 0.8–1.1 mL/minute with a rotor speed of 3,300 rpm. Rotor
speed was reduced in decrements of 80 rpm to collect a total of
20 fractions. Aliquots of individual fractions were ﬁxed and
subjected to propidium iodide staining and ﬂow cytometry.
Speciﬁc fractions were pooled to enrich for cells in deﬁned cellcycle phases. Cells with the smallest diameter (earliest in the cell
cycle) eluted ﬁrst. Pooled fractions were centrifuged and cells
resuspended in fresh medium at 1–1.5  106 cells/mL. Cell
diameter was measured using a Beckman Z2 Coulter Counter
and data analyzed with Z2 AccuComp software.
EdU incorporation assay
5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen)
using the Click-iT EdU Imaging Kit (cat. no. C10086), with some
modiﬁcations. Cells isolated after centrifugal elutriation were
incubated with 10 mmol/L EdU and either 0.1% DMSO (vehicle)
or 100 nmol/L vincristine and harvested at speciﬁc time intervals
by washing in PBS and ﬁxing with 70% cold ethanol for 15
minutes. Cells were then washed with wash solution (3%
BSA in PBS), incubated with permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton
X-100 in PBS) for 20 minutes, washed again, suspended in 200 mL
of Click-iT reaction cocktail (with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 647),
and incubated for 30 minutes in the dark. Cells were then washed,
resuspended, and 20 mL propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) was
added prior to analysis by ﬂow cytometry.

To monitor individual cell divisions and to determine whether
ALL cells harbor a quiescent population, the Cell Proliferation
Dye eFluor 450 kit (eBioscience) was used. A total of 1  106 ALL

cells were washed with PBS thrice and resuspended in PBS. An
equal volume of 20 mmol/L eFluor 450 was added and incubated
at room temperature for 20 minutes according to manufacturer's
instructions. Labeling was stopped by adding 4 and 0.04 volumes
of complete media and 20% human serum albumin, respectively,
and incubating on ice for 5 minutes. Cells were washed three times
with complete media, resuspended in medium, and returned to
culture. Cell aliquots were removed at daily intervals, washed and
resuspended in PBS, and propidium iodide was added. Fluorescence was measured using a BD LSRFortessa Flow Cytometer with
data analysis using ModFit LT 4 (VSH) software. Nonviable
(propidium iodide–positive) cells were excluded from analysis.

Results
Vincristine induces cell death without signiﬁcant prior mitotic
arrest in primary ALL cultures
In initial experiments, we compared the effects of vincristine on
mitotic arrest in exponentially growing populations of KB3
(HeLa) and RS4;11 (ALL) cell lines and in two primary ALL cell
cultures, namely ALL-2 and ALL-5, derived as described previously
(25) and recently characterized with respect to Bcl-2 dependence
(26). DNA content analysis showed that KB3 cells underwent

www.aacrjournals.org

mitotic arrest (determined by 4N DNA content) and subsequent
apoptosis (determined by <2N DNA content) in response to
100 nmol/L vincristine (Fig. 1A), similar to the results we had
reported previously using vinblastine (29, 30). RS4;11 cells gave a
similar response, although the extent of M-phase arrest was less
than observed for KB3 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when we
examined the primary ALL cell cultures, cell death occurred
without evidence of a prolonged mitotic arrest (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of the results conﬁrmed that vincristine induced timedependent death in all cell types as determined by <2N DNA
content (Fig. 1B, top), but signiﬁcant mitotic arrest was only
observed in KB3 and RS4;11 cells (Fig. 1B, bottom). This profound difference in response was not due to major differences in
vincristine sensitivity, as IC50 values for vincristine of the ALL
cultures were similar to those of the KB3 and RS4;11 cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1). Two other MTAs were tested in
ALL-5 cells: docetaxel, a microtubule polymerizing agent, and
vinblastine, a microtubule depolymerizing agent (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Both drugs induced signiﬁcant levels of apoptosis without evidence of a prolonged or marked mitotic accumulation,
suggesting that they can also induce death from interphase. The
lack of a robust mitotic arrest in response to vincristine in the ALL
cells could not be attributed to defects in the spindle assembly

checkpoint, because robust mitotic arrest was observed in cells
treated with the Aurora A kinase inhibitor, MLN8237 (Supplementary Fig. S3). To further examine the kinetics of cell death and
relationship to mitotic arrest, immunoblotting was performed for
PARP, which is cleaved during apoptosis, and with MPM2 antibody, which recognizes mitotic phosphoproteins (Fig. 1C and D).
PARP cleavage in KB3 cells was coincident with strong MPM2
staining, consistent with Fig. 1A and with the occurrence of
mitotic death, whereas PARP cleavage in the primary ALL cultures
was incomplete at 24 hours and occurred in concert with relatively
weak MPM2 staining (Fig. 1C). In RS4;11 cells, PARP cleavage
preceded a relatively strong MPM2 signal (Fig. 1D), suggesting
that some cells may die via nonmitotic death. Preliminary experiments have indicated that a range of vincristine concentrations,
from 10 to 1,000 nmol/L, induces death of ALL cells without
signiﬁcant mitotic arrest, as determined by examination of
DNA content by propidium iodide staining and ﬂow cytometry,
suggesting that interphase death in these cells is a general response
to microtubule inhibition and not a concentration-dependent
response.
Distinct responses of primary ALL cells to vincristine in
different phases of the cell cycle
The results of Fig. 1 suggested two possibilities; either that the
ALL cells were dying in response to vincristine after a very transient
mitotic arrest, such that mitotic markers were only weakly represented due to their rapid reversal, or that they were dying primarily
in interphase without transit ﬁrst to mitosis. To distinguish these
possibilities, isolation or synchronization of cells at different cellcycle phases was needed. However, their relatively long doubling
times (Table 1) precluded chemical methods, as the cells were
unable to survive lengthy treatments with agents such as thymidine or hydroxyurea. Therefore, a physical method of cell synchronization, centrifugal elutriation, which separates cells based
on their size, which, in turn, increases with advance through the

3556 Cancer Res; 76(12) June 15, 2016

cell cycle, was tested. Flow cytometric analysis of side-scatter, an
indicator of cell size, and of DNA content after propidium iodide
staining, showed a good correlation between the two parameters
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Initial elutriation experiments indeed
established the effectiveness of the technique in isolation of cells
in different phases of the cell cycle. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S5, pools of early fractions were highly enriched (95.4%) in
G1 (or G0) phase cells with 2N DNA content, intermediate
fractions contained larger diameter cells in G1 and S phases, and
later fractions were enriched (61.2%) in cells with 4N DNA
content, representing G2–M phases. Measurement of average cell
diameter in individual fractions conﬁrmed the relationship
between cell diameter and cell-cycle phase. For example, speciﬁc
values in a typical experiment ranged from 8.9 mm for early
fractions representing early G1 phase cells, to 11.7 mm for late
fractions representing G2–M phase cells.
To determine the response to vincristine of cells in different
phases of the cell cycle, elutriated ALL-2 cells in either G1 or G2–M
phases were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or 100 nmol/L
vincristine, harvested at speciﬁc times, and DNA content analyzed
(Fig. 2). When treated with vehicle (Fig. 2A, top row), cells initially
in G1 transited into S- and G2–M phases over time, with 20.1%
exhibiting 4N DNA at 24 hours, with a return to approximately
normal cell-cycle proportions by 48 hours. Over this 48-hour
period, there was essentially no evidence of cell death, with only
2.3% of cells with <2N DNA at 48 hours, indicating that the cells
suffered no ill-consequences from elutriation and subsequent
culture. When cells initially in G1 were treated with vincristine
(Fig. 2A, second row), a smaller percentage of the total population
transited into S and G2–M phases compared with vehicle-treated
cells, and between 24 and 48 hours there was a large increase
in cells with <2N DNA content indicative of cell death. Similar
results were obtained with ALL-5 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
We next analyzed cells enriched for those with 4N DNA content
(Fig. 2A, third and fourth rows). When treated with vehicle, the

Vincristine-Induced Interphase Death in Leukemia Cells

Figure 3.
Vincristine depolymerizes microtubules in both asynchronous and G1-phase ALL cells. Asynchronous (A) or G1-phase (B) ALL-5 cells were treated with 0.1 %
DMSO (Ctrl) or 100 nmol/L vincristine (VCR) for 1 hour and harvested. Cells were also treated with 100 nmol/L taxol (TAX) for 1 hour or 2 mmol/L CaCl2 for 5 minutes to
serve as polymerization and depolymerization controls, respectively. Soluble tubulin (S) and polymerized tubulin (P) were separated as described in
Materials and Methods and subjected to immunoblotting for a-tubulin. Total tubulin, present in cell homogenates prior to centrifugation, was used as a
loading control. The relative proportions of a-tubulin present in soluble and pellet fractions, determined as described in Materials and Methods and given as
%S/%P, is as follows. A, Ctrl, 42/58; TAX, 21/79; CaCl2, 50/50; VCR, 56/44. B, Ctrl, 60/40; TAX, 51/49; CaCl2, 75/25; VCR, 76/24.

cells completed the cell cycle and divided, mainly returning to G1
phase at 16–24 hours, with little evidence of cell death by 48 hours
(Fig. 2A, third row). In contrast, when treated with vincristine,
cells underwent M-phase arrest, with 86.4% cells having 4N DNA
content within 8 hours of vincristine treatment, and by 48 hours,
50% of cells had <2N DNA content (Fig. 2A, fourth row). Similar
results were obtained with ALL-5 cells, which are represented
graphically in Supplementary Fig. S6B.
Elutriated ALL-2 or ALL-5 cells initially in G1 (Fig. 2B) or G2–M
(Fig. 2C) were treated with 100 nmol/L vincristine for indicated
time periods and analyzed by immunoblotting for PARP and
MPM2. G1 cells exhibited vincristine-induced PARP cleavage after
a delay of 24 hours and in the absence of the mitotic marker
MPM2 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, G2–M ALL cells exhibited much
more rapid vincristine-induced PARP cleavage coincident with
increased MPM2 staining (Fig. 2C). Together, the results of Fig. 2
suggest that vincristine induces distinct pathways of cell death in
primary ALL cells, dependent on position in the cell cycle when
the drug is encountered. The fact that the majority (typically 70%–
75%) of ALL cells are in G1 phase with only a small proportion
(9%–12%) in G2–M phases (Fig. 1A) likely explains why mitotic
death signals are not prominent when asynchronous cells were
examined (Fig. 1), but become readily detectable when G2–Menriched cells were used (Fig. 2). As a control for these experiments, elutriated cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO up to 48
hours, and extracts subjected to immunoblotting for PARP and
MPM2. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S7, PARP remained intact
throughout, consistent with maintenance of cell viability, and
MPM2 staining was largely lacking, consistent with an absence of
cells undergoing mitotic arrest.
Vincristine causes microtubule depolymerization
Because vincristine appeared to promote death in G1 phase in
primary ALL cells, it was particularly important to conﬁrm that
microtubules were targeted by the drug. ALL cells were therefore
treated with vincristine, or with taxol or CaCl2 to act as positive
and negative controls, respectively, for tubulin polymerization,
and depolymerized and polymerized tubulin were separated and
analyzed, as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig.
3, tubulin was present in control cells in both depolymerized
(soluble) and polymerized forms. Vincristine caused an increase
in depolymerized tubulin and a corresponding decrease in polymerized tubulin in both asynchronous (Fig. 3A) and G1 phase
(Fig. 3B) ALL cells. The known depolymerizing agent CaCl2 (31)
gave very similar results; conversely, the microtubule stabilizing

www.aacrjournals.org

agent taxol (32) caused an increase in polymerized tubulin and a
corresponding decrease in depolymerized tubulin. Quantitation
of tubulin expression, performed as described in Materials and
Methods, conﬁrmed these observations (see Fig. 3 legend). Total
tubulin levels were unaffected. These results conﬁrm that microtubules are a target of vincristine action in ALL cells.
ALL cells in G1 phase can undergo death directly in response to
vincristine without cell-cycle transit
To more rigorously test whether primary ALL cells in G1 phase
die directly in response to vincristine without cell-cycle transit,
ALL-5 cells in G1 phase were incubated with 5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU) and either vehicle or 100 nmol/L vincristine and
harvested at speciﬁc intervals up to 48 hours. After ﬂuorescently
labeling the EdU incorporated into DNA, cells were stained with
propidium iodide and subjected to two-parameter ﬂow cytometry. The resulting cytograms are shown in Fig. 4A, and quantitation
of the proportion of EdU-positive versus EdU-negative cells that
were either alive (>2N DNA) or dead (<2N DNA) shown in Fig. 4B
and C, respectively. Cells initially gated to the left side of the lower
right quadrant of the cytogram, reﬂecting a DNA content (x-axis)
of 2N and an absence of EdU labeling (y-axis; Fig. 4A). When
treated with vehicle (Fig. 4A, top row), the cells became EdU
labeled and increased their DNA content, reﬂecting transit
through S-phase and beyond. By 48 hours, 43% of live cells were
EdU labeled (Fig. 4B), and only a minor population had <2N
DNA content (Fig. 4A and C). When treated with vincristine
(Fig. 4A, bottom row), a majority of cells in G1 phase shifted
from 2N DNA content to <2N DNA content without becoming
EdU labeled, representing 43.5% of total cells by 48 hours, and
only a minor proportion (2.4%) of dead cells were EdU positive
(Fig. 4C). These results indicate that ALL cells treated with vincristine can die directly from G1 without further cell-cycle transit.
Essentially identical results were obtained in two independent
experiments with ALL-5 cells and the same pattern was obtained
with ALL-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Validation of EdU labeling through use of a mixed population
To rule out the possibility that the presence of vincristine
affected the efﬁciency of EdU labeling, ALL-5 cells were subjected
to centrifugal elutriation, and intermediate fractions pooled such
that both G1 (82.4%) and S (17.6%) phases were represented (see
Supplementary Fig. S5B). Cells were incubated with EdU and 100
nmol/L vincristine or 0.1% DMSO, harvested at intervals up to 48

hours and subjected to ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 5). On treatment with
vehicle (Fig. 5A, top row), by 48 hours, about half the population
of cells had become EdU labeled (Fig. 5B) with only a low
incidence of dead cells (Fig. 5C). When treated with vincristine
(Fig. 5A, bottom row), by 48 hours, dead cells were approximately
evenly divided between EdU-positive and EdU-negative, with
about 21% of the total appearing in the top left quadrant, that
is, dead and EdU-positive (Fig. 5A and C). This corresponds well
with the initial S-phase population (17% of total cells), and shows
that vincristine does not interfere with EdU labeling. Essentially,
the same pattern was obtained with ALL-2 cells. These data also
emphasize and reinforce the conclusion that G1 cells treated with
vincristine are highly susceptible to death without further cellcycle transit.
All cells within the primary ALL cultures are actively
dividing
We considered the possibility that ALL cells with 2N
DNA may be comprised of two subpopulations, namely
quiescent (or non-cycling, G0) and cycling (G1), and that
G0 cells may be the population most susceptible to vincristine-induced death. To determine whether quiescent cells
were present, a cell proliferation assay using the violet ﬂuorescent dye, eFluor 450, was performed, as described in
Materials and Methods. The dye binds to primary amines in
proteins, and the label is expected to dilute with each cell

division but be maintained at original levels in nondividing
cells. ALL-5 cells were labeled with the dye and after washing,
ﬂuorescence was determined at daily intervals. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S9, at day zero, a single parent peak of
ﬂuorescence was observed, and over 3 days the ﬂuorescent
intensity reduced to approximately one-half with no residual
signal at the day zero position. These results indicate that ALL
cells are in an actively dividing state with no evidence of a
quiescent population, and are also consistent with a doubling
time of 2.8 days determined independently (Table 1). Similar
results were obtained when carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl
ester (CFSE), another proliferation marker similar to eFluor
450, was used. These results are also consistent with a previous study that inferred that all cells within the ALL cultures
were in a proliferative state (25).

Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that primary ALL cell cultures
treated with vincristine undergo two distinct pathways of cell
death. Using centrifugal elutriation to separate cells into different
cell-cycle phases together with EdU labeling to monitor subsequent S-phase progression, we showed that cells in G1 phase can
die directly, whereas cells in later phases transit to M-phase ﬁrst
and then die. A model summarizing these ﬁndings is presented
in Fig. 6. We propose that primary ALL cells in G1 phase are

susceptible to death directly, whereas cells that have passed
a putative "microtubule sensitivity checkpoint" in late G1/early
S-phase continue to cycle and undergo M-phase arrest and cell
death. Docetaxel and vinblastine appear to act similarly (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that this model applies to MTAs
in general. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the
cellular and molecular basis for G1 phase sensitivity to MTAs,
and the mechanisms that allow many cell lines to bypass such
susceptibility.
When G1 phase cells were subjected to EdU labeling,
only about half the population migrated out of their starting
position, and many remained EdU-negative with 2N DNA
(Fig. 4A). However, when G1 phase cells were subjected to
the cell proliferation dye assay in the absence of drug treatment, all the cells showed the expected dye dilution within two
days of culture, indicating they had progressed through the cell
cycle. Thus, isolated G1 cells appear to be fully cell-cycle
competent. The reason for the apparent inability of many
G1-phase cells to progress into subsequent cell-cycle phases
during the EdU assay may therefore be related to the speciﬁc
conditions of the assay. Exhaustion of the pool of EdU does
not seem to be a factor, because cells would still be expected to
enter S-phase and show an increase in DNA content from 2N to
4N. As this fraction of the population remained EdU-negative

with 2N DNA content, it appears they failed to enter S-phase,
perhaps because EdU incorporation limits DNA replication in
certain cells. Further work will be required to clarify the basis
for this observation.
Previous studies have provided indirect evidence for interphase death or cell-cycle–independent death in response to
vinca alkaloids (20–24). In most instances, signiﬁcant levels of
interphase death were only observed in conjunction with other
agents, such as that seen in ML-1 cells cotreated with vinblastine plus inhibitors of either ERK or CDKs (21, 23). In a more
recent study of a panel of leukemia cell lines, one cell line,
OC1-AML1, underwent very rapid death, with 100% of the
cells affected within 4 hours after being treated with vincristine
alone (22). In another study, rapid cell death was observed in
U2OS osteosarcoma cells treated with vinorelbine (20). However, in both cases, relatively high drug concentrations, in the
low- to mid-micromolar range, were used, and it remains
unclear whether such acute effects would have been observed
at lower concentrations. Importantly, in these and related
studies, evidence for interphase death has often been inferred
based on the rapid appearance of death signals such as cleaved
PARP or activated caspase-3 in asynchronous cells. We also
noted PARP cleavage at early time points in vincristine-treated
asynchronous ALL cell cultures (Fig. 1C), but examination of
cells enriched in different cell-cycle phases revealed that those
in G2 and/or M-phase were the source of these signals (Fig.
2C). In contrast, vincristine-induced cell death in G1-phase
cells was considerably delayed (Fig. 2B). Thus, the early
appearance of death signals in cells treated with an MTA does
not necessarily imply death originated in interphase cells, as
cells advancing to and entering M-phase can be rapidly susceptible, especially if death ensues without a prolonged mitotic arrest. The use of cells enriched in different phases as
exploited here eliminates interpretational problems that can
result from the study of asynchronous populations undergoing
mixed responses.
Our data imply that microtubules play some essential role in
G1 phase in primary ALL cells. Although the exact mechanism
of interphase cell death induced by MTAs is still unclear, other
studies have implicated rapid events such as the induction of
the proapoptotic protein Noxa in CLL cells (33) or the activation of JNK in ML-1 cells (21). However, in preliminary studies,
we have failed to observe any acute effects on Bcl-2 family
protein expression or JNK pathway activation (unpublished
observations). Recently, interference with intracellular protein
trafﬁcking has been suggested as a possible mechanism to
explain the interphase effects of MTAs. One study showed that
in prostate cancer cells, taxanes act, at least in part, by inhibiting nuclear transport of the androgen receptor (AR), and hence
block AR-mediated signaling (34). It was also recently reported
that MTAs interfere with the trafﬁcking of DNA repair proteins
on interphase microtubules, providing a mechanistic explanation for the long-standing observation that MTAs and DNAdamaging agents act synergistically (35). We observed that the
induction of apoptosis in primary ALL cells in G1 phase was not
initiated until 24 hours after vincristine treatment (Fig. 2B).
Thus, the response is delayed rather than acute, and as such is
more compatible with a mechanism involving interference
with protein trafﬁcking than one involving rapid induction of
a death stimulus.

3560 Cancer Res; 76(12) June 15, 2016

The results of this study have several important implications. First, MTAs are well established as an effective therapy
for many cancer types, many of which are relatively slowgrowing with low mitotic indices (12, 36). Our ﬁnding that
vincristine also targets cells in G1 phase provides a plausible
explanation for these clinical observations and a potential
solution to this paradox. Second, the results suggest that
primary ALL cell cultures, and perhaps other primary or nonimmortalized tumor cell types, represent unique tools to
uncover novel mechanisms of MTA action with clinical relevance. Third, our observation that relatively low and clinically
relevant concentrations of vincristine can kill cells in G1 phase
adds to a growing body of evidence that microtubules contribute to fundamental cellular processes outside of mitosis
(37). Finally, understanding drug mechanism is critically
important in rational drug design and discovery, in the testing
and development of novel drug combinations, and in patient
stratiﬁcation. Conversely, a lack of understanding of clinical
mechanisms can lead to the development of ineffective drugs
(12), resulting in poor utilization of available resources. As we
enter an era where customized therapies are under development and may replace standardized regimens, studies designed
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of antitumor
agents are even more vital.
