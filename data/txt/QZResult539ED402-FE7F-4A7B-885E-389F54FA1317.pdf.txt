BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and irinotecan have single-agent antitumor activity in squamous cell carcinoma
of the head and neck (SCCHN). The authors sought to evaluate their combination in the treatment of
patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included recurrent or metastatic
SCCHN with measurable disease, good performance status, and adequate laboratory parameters. Patients
received docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and irinotecan 60 mg/m2, intravenously, on Days 1 and 8, every 21 days, until
disease progression. The authors assessed UGT1A1 genotype, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in
serum, and cyclooxygenase-2 and VEGF in baseline tumor tissue. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were analyzable: 20 chemotherapy naive (Group A) and 32 previously treated with 1 chemotherapy regimen (Group B);
73% of patients had distant metastasis, and 60% were paclitaxel-exposed. In Group A, 3 (15%)
patients achieved a partial response; in Group B, 1 (3%) patient achieved a partial response. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 3.3 and 8.2 months in Group A and 1.9 and 5.0 months
in Group B, respectively. Common serious toxicities were diarrhea, fatigue, and anorexia. Patients with high
serum VEGF had a median PFS of 2.8 months versus 1.7 months for patients with low VEGF (P ¼ .085).
CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel and irinotecan had acceptable toxicities, but efficacy results in unselected
patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN did not suggest an advantage over docetaxel alone or

KEY WORDS: irinotecan, docetaxel, head and neck cancer, vascular endothelial growth factor.

More than 45,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States.1
Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) have a
poor prognosis.2 Cisplatin-based combination regimens given as first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN result in objective response rates of about 30% and median overall survival (OS) of 8 to
9 months.3 More recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were introduced in the systemic
therapy of SCCHN.4 However, at present time, there is no standard regimen for the second-line treatment of
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.

Docetaxel and Irinotecan/Argiris et al

Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane that acts as a mitotic spindle poison by promoting microtubule assembly
but inhibiting tubulin depolymerization, which disrupts
cell division. The major toxicity with the 3-week scheduling of docetaxel is neutropenia, which is ameliorated by
weekly administration.5 Clinical studies have documented
the efficacy of docetaxel in many solid tumors, even after
previous treatment with paclitaxel.6 Weekly docetaxel at a
dose of 30 mg/m2 was highly active in a phase 2 trial in
chemonaive recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with a
reported response rate of 42% and median OS of 11.3
months.7 A phase 2 randomized study of weekly docetaxel
versus methotrexate showed higher response rates for
docetaxel but comparable survival rates.8
Irinotecan is a water-soluble analogue of camptothecin that inhibits topoisomerase I, a critical enzyme for
DNA replication and transcription. Irinotecan is metabolized in the liver to SN-38, an active metabolite that
undergoes glucuronidation in the liver through uridine
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1
(UGT1A1) to the relatively inactive SN-38G (SN-38 glucuronide). The major toxicities of irinotecan are neutropenia and diarrhea. Polymorphisms in UGT1A1 have
been reported to result in increased incidence of irinotecan-related toxicities.9,10 A phase 2 study of irinotecan
given weekly at 125 mg/m2 for 4 weeks followed by
2 weeks of rest in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN
reported a response rate of 26% in 19 evaluable patients.11
Because of toxicity, 14 subsequent evaluable patients were
treated at a lower dose of 75 mg/m2, and the schedule was
altered to 2 weeks on, 1 week off. The response rate in this
cohort was 14%. However, irinotecan had no significant
activity when given in the second-line therapy setting.11
The combination of irinotecan and docetaxel is supported by preclinical observations and showed promising
activity in early clinical investigations in solid tumors.12 A
phase 1 clinical trial established the recommended phase 2
dose as irinotecan 60 mg/m2 and docetaxel 35 mg/m2 on
Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days.13 On the basis of
these observations, we designed a phase 2 study to investigate the antitumor activity and toxicities with irinotecan
and docetaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic
SCCHN. We also examined the potential correlation
between UGT1A1 genotype and toxicity of the regimen.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) are overexpressed in SCCHN.14-16

Therefore, we also sought to evaluate the expression of
COX-2 and VEGF in tumor tissue as well as serum
VEGF as predictors of antitumor efficacy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligible patients were 18 years of age with recurrent or
metastatic SCCHN considered incurable by means of
locoregional therapies, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors.17 Patients were enrolled simultaneously in
2 groups. Group A patients could not have received prior
chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease
but may have received chemotherapy as part of primary curative therapy, if completed >6 months before registration.
Group B patients had to have received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for locally recurrent or metastatic disease, or
chemotherapy as part of primary curative therapy <6
months before registration. Prior paclitaxel was permitted,
but prior docetaxel or irinotecan at any time was not
allowed. Other inclusion criteria included adequate hematologic and liver function test parameters and no peripheral
neuropathy of grade 2 or worse. All patients signed
informed consent, and the protocol was approved by each
institution’s human investigations committee.
Treatment Plan
Docetaxel (Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) was administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion at a dose of 35
mg/m2 followed by the administration of irinotecan
(Pharmacia Corporation/Pfizer Inc, New York, NY)
intravenously over 30 minutes at a dose of 60 mg/m2.
Chemotherapy was given on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day
schedule and continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Patients received
antiemetics and dexamethasone for a total of 3 doses,
12 hours before, 30 minutes before, and 12 hours after
docetaxel. All toxicities were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0). A dose reduction of docetaxel to 30 mg/m2
and irinotecan to 50 mg/m2 was allowed. High-dose
loperamide, tincture of opium, and octreotide were used
for treatment of delayed diarrhea.

Patient Assessments and Monitoring
Patients were evaluated by computed tomography (CT)
of the chest and abdomen and CT or magnetic resonance
imaging of the neck at baseline, within 4 weeks of registration, and then after every 3 cycles (9 weeks). Bone scan
was performed at baseline and then as clinically indicated.
When a patient was deemed to have an objective response,
tumor measurements were to be repeated 4 to 6 weeks
later to confirm the response. Complete blood counts
were obtained on Days 1 and 8, and serum chemistry tests
were on Day 1 of each cycle.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint was the overall objective response
rate, which was defined as the proportion of patients with
complete or partial response defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors17 among eligible, treated
patients, including patients not evaluable for response. In
the first stage of a 2-stage design, 14 eligible patients (16
total to allow for a 10% ineligibility rate) were to be
accrued to each of the 2 cohorts. Response rates of 40%
and 20% were considered promising in Groups A and B,
respectively. If at least 4 responses were seen in Group A
and at least 1 response in Group B, accrual would continue to the second stage to accrue 18 additional patients
in each group (ie, the total accrual goal was 32 eligible
patients for each group). OS was defined as the time from
registration to the date of death or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from
registration to disease progression or death from any cause
or last follow-up. Two-stage confidence intervals, 2-stage
power calculations, and the 2-stage stopping rules were
used to analyze the data in regard to the study’s 2-stage
design.18 Fisher exact test19 was used to analyze the contingency tables of response and to compare the distribution of categorical data between groups. Cochran-MantelHaenszel test was used to assess the association between
response and categories adjusting for the differences in
prior treatment status. The Wilcoxon rank sum test20 was
used to compare the distribution of continuous data
between the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted
for OS and PFS.21 The log-rank test statistic was used to
compare survival curves between categories, and a stratified log-rank test was used to adjust for differences in prior
treatment status. Moreover, logistic and Cox proportional
4506

hazards regression models,22 respectively, were used to
model objective response and survival data on covariates
of interest while adjusting for prior treatment status. Mehta’s exact test for ordered categorical data was used to test
for associations between UGT1A1 genotype and toxicity
severity.23 Two-sided P values are reported for all the statistical tests used in the analysis.
Correlative Studies
Immunohistochemistry for COX-2 and VEGF

Immunohistochemistry for the determination of
COX-2 and VEGF in archival formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tumor tissue was performed using commercially available antibodies: a monoclonal mouse antihuman COX-2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich), at
1:50 dilution, and a polyclonal rabbit antihuman
VEGF(A-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
Calif), at 1:500 dilution. For VEGF cytoplasmic staining,
tumors were assigned a score of either 0 (negative), 1þ
(weak, <1% of cells), 2þ (medium, 1%-10% of cells), or
3þ (strong, >10% of the tumor cells); for COX-2 membrane staining, tumors were assigned a score of either 0
(negative, or faint in <10%), 1þ (faint, >10% of cells),
2þ (moderate, >10% of cells), or 3þ (strong, complete
in >10% of the tumor cells). The median intensity of
VEGF was used to classify the cases into low (<1.5) or
high (>1.5) VEGF categories. A cutoff of 2þ COX-2
intensity was used to classify the cases into low (2) or
high (>2) categories.
Serum VEGF

Quantitative determination of human VEGF concentrations in serum was performed by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay using either kit DY293B or
DVE00 from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn). Samples were measured in duplicate, and VEGF standard was
included with every group of sera tested. The coefficient
of variation for VEGF standard was 10% (62.5-2000
pg/mL). The median serum VEGF score was used to classify the cases into low (394) or high (>394) serum
VEGF categories.
UGT1A1 genotyping

Genomic DNA for UGT1A1 determination was
prepared from whole blood (100-200 mL) using the
Cancer

Docetaxel and Irinotecan/Argiris et al

QIAmp blood kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). A standard
polymerase chain reaction was performed using
UGT1A1-specific primers that flanked the TATA region
with the forward primer biotinylated. TA repeat number
was determined by pyrosequencing with a PSQ 96MA
pyrosequencer and software (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden)
by standard methods.24,25 Genotypes for the cell lines
DU145 and MCF-7 were previously determined to be 6
of 7 and 7 of 7, respectively. DU145 (n ¼ 7) and MCF-7
(n ¼ 3) were assayed with 100% accuracy for each gene.
One or both of these cell lines were included as a positive
control along with patient samples in each pyrosequencing reaction.

RESULTS
From October 2002 until August 2004, a total of 54
patients were enrolled, 18 in Group A and 36 in Group B.
Two patients in Group B never started treatment; 1
patient withdrew consent and another signed consent but
died before starting treatment. Four patients were reclassified with respect to their prior chemotherapy, 1 from
Group A to B and 3 from Group B to A. As a result, there
were 52 analyzable patients; 20 in Group A, and 32 in
Group B. Although 4 objective responses were observed
in Group A, 1 was not confirmed by repeat imaging, and
accrual did not proceed to the second stage for that group.
Patient characteristics and prior treatments are shown in
Tables 1 and 2. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of
irinotecan and docetaxel (range, 1-10 cycles).

Response
In Group A, there were 3 partial responses for a response
rate of 15% (90% confidence interval, 4.2%-34.4%) and
in Group B, there was 1 partial response for a response
rate of 3.1% (90% confidence interval 0.004%-19.6%).
There was an additional unconfirmed partial response in
each group (Table 3). Of the 52 patients, 13 were unevaluable because no post-treatment measurements were
taken; 4 patients had symptomatic deterioration, 1 patient
died before first follow-up assessment, 4 patients withdrew from study after only 1 cycle of treatment because of
toxicity, 3 patients had inadequate data or were lost to follow-up, and 1 patient did not have a consistent method of
evaluation.

OS and PFS
At the time of this analysis, all patients but 1 have progressed or died. For patients in Group A, the median OS
was 8.2 months, and for patients in Group B, the median
OS was 5.0 months (Table 3 and Fig. 1). In Group A, the
median PFS was 3.3 months, and in Group B, the median
PFS was 1.9 months. No baseline characteristic was found
to be statistically significant in predicting survival, but the
study was not powered to identify such factors.
Toxicity
Three deaths, all in Group B, were deemed possibly
related to study treatment. Two were because of sepsis, in
1 case associated with neutropenia, diarrhea, and dehydration. The third patient presented after 2 weeks of treatment on cycle 1 with fever, chills, and dyspnea, refused
treatment, and died at home 2 days later from presumed
pneumonia. Two other patients, 1 in each group, died
from grade 5 carotid hemorrhage without thrombocytopenia, which was attributed to disease progression. The
most common grade 3 or 4 events in the 2 groups combined were diarrhea (grade 3, 21%; grade 4, 4%), fatigue
(grade 3, 17%), anorexia (grade 3, 8%; grade 4, 4%), and
neutropenia (grade 3, 8%; grade 4, 13%). Only 1 patient
(2%) had febrile neutropenia (Table 4).
COX-2 and VEGF
Forty-one patients consented for the use of their samples
for correlative studies. COX-2 and VEGF tumor expression data were available for 31 and 29 cases, respectively.
We did not detect any significant differences in OS or
PFS between groups on the basis of COX-2 or VEGF
expression, presumably because of small sample sizes (Table 5). Baseline serum VEGF data were available for 18
patients. The association between serum VEGF at baseline and median PFS is shown in Table 5. Patients with
high baseline VEGF levels had a median PFS of 2.84
months versus 1.73 months for patients with low VEGF
(P ¼ .085, using stratified log-rank test).

DISCUSSION
We evaluated the combination of docetaxel and irinotecan, a novel non–platinum-containing regimen, in the
first- or second-line treatment of patients with recurrent
or metastatic SCCHN. Both drugs were given on a weekly
Cancer

October 1, 2009

schedule of administration based on prior phase 1 experience.13 Phase 2 trials of docetaxel and irinotecan, using
weekly or every 3 weeks schedules of administration, have
been conducted in many other solid tumors.26-33 To the
best of our knowledge, this is the only phase 2 study of
docetaxel and irinotecan in recurrent or metastatic
SCCHN. Although objective responses were observed,
the prespecified criteria for efficacy were not met. In the
first-line setting (Group A), 4 objective responses were
observed as required per study design, but 1 was unconfirmed, which did not allow the study to accrue beyond
the first stage of a 2-stage Simon design. The statistical
design assumed a target response rate of 40% in Group A,
which in retrospect was rather high for the cooperative
group setting and with the application of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Other cooperative group
studies in comparable patient populations, such as E5397
and E1595, showed that single-agent chemotherapy with
cisplatin achieves an objective response rate of 10% and
median survival of 8 months (E5397),34 and that cisplatin
doublets (cisplatin/5-FU or cisplatin/paclitaxel) result in
objective response rates of 26% to 27% and median survival of 8.1 to 8.7 months (E1395).3 In the current study,
docetaxel and irinotecan produced a response rate of 17%
(22% counting an unconfirmed response), median PFS of
3.3 months, and median OS of 8.2 months. Therefore,
survival results with docetaxel and irinotecan may be comparable to platinum-based combinations.

Docetaxel and Irinotecan/Argiris et al

The group of patients treated in the second-line setting (Group B) is 1 of the largest that have been studied so
far, and it was characterized by a high representation of
patients with distant metastasis (78%) and previous treatment with paclitaxel (81%). In these patients, the efficacy
of docetaxel and irinotecan, with a response rate of 3%
(6% counting an unconfirmed response), median PFS of
1.9 months, and median OS of 5.0 months, cannot be
considered satisfactory. As a single agent, irinotecan may
be inactive in previously treated recurrent or metastatic
SCCHN,11 whereas data with single-agent docetaxel is
limited in a similar setting, but activity has been
reported.35
The docetaxel and irinotecan regimen we used in
our study was associated with expected toxicities, which
were predominantly nonhematologic, including diarrhea,
anorexia, and fatigue. Although most of the patients had
received paclitaxel in the past, grade 3 or 4 neuropathy
was not seen. Grade 4 toxicity was observed in 30% of
chemotherapy-naive patients in this study versus 42% and
50% with cisplatin/paclitaxel and cisplatin/5-FU, respectively, in E1395, whereas there was no treatment-related
death versus 5% and 7% with cisplatin/paclitaxel and cisplatin/5-FU, respectively.3 However, there were some differences in the toxicity criteria used between these ECOG
studies, so the rates of grade 3 and 4 toxicities may not be
directly comparable. Polymorphisms in the UGT1A1
gene have demonstrated racial variability and have been
shown to be associated with differences in observed toxicities among patients treated with irinotecan. We could
not demonstrate any correlation of toxicities with
UGT1A1 genotypes, possibly because of the small sample
size, or the low dose of irinotecan used in this study.
COX-2 and VEGF are overexpressed in SCCHN
and have been suggested as potential predictors of outcome.14-16,36 Moreover, COX-2 expression has been
reported to correlate with the expression of VEGF in
SCCHN. On the basis of preclinical observations, it has
been proposed that docetaxel may have an antiangiogenic
effect.37 We elected to assess VEGF as well as COX-2 on
baseline tumor tissue and attempted to associate its
expression with outcome. However, in the clinical setting
examined, we could not demonstrate that expression of either COX-2 or VEGF correlated with worse survival, possibly because of insufficient sample size.38 Patients with
high serum VEGF levels had a trend toward improved

PFS with docetaxel and irinotecan versus patients with
low levels at baseline, an observation that may require further evaluation in subsequent studies.
The docetaxel and irinotecan regimen we used was
feasible and was associated with a toxicity profile potentially favorable to cisplatin-based combinations. However,
its antitumor activity is unlikely to be superior to platinum-based combinations in the first-line treatment of
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, whereas its antitumor
activity in the second-line setting was rather disappointing. It has been reported that selected patients, such as
those with tumors with high levels of excision repair cross
complementation Group 1, may benefit less from platinum-based chemotherapy.39 Whether docetaxel and irinotecan, a nonplatinum doublet, will be beneficial in
selected patients, such as those with tumors with high
excision repair cross complementation Group 1, is a
worthwhile hypothesis to be evaluated in future clinical
trials in patients with SCCHN.
