Cancer by Inhibiting Leukotriene A4 Hydrolase

Abstract
The anticancer effects of red wine have attracted considerable attention. Resveratrol (3,5,40 -trihydroxytrans-stilbene) is a well-known polyphenolic compound of red wine with cancer chemopreventive activity.
However, the basis for this activity is unclear. We studied leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) as a relevant target in
pancreatic cancer. LTA4H knockdown limited the formation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), the enzymatic product of
LTA4H, and suppressed anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells. An in silico shape similarity
algorithm predicted that LTA4H might be a potential target of resveratrol. In support of this idea, we found that
resveratrol directly bound to LTA4H in vitro and in cells and suppressed proliferation and anchorageindependent growth of pancreatic cancer by inhibiting LTB4 production and expression of the LTB4 receptor
1 (BLT1). Notably, resveratrol exerted relatively stronger inhibitory effects than bestatin, an established inhibitor
of LTA4H activity, and the inhibitory effects of resveratrol were reduced in cells where LTA4H was suppressed by
shRNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, resveratrol inhibited tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model of
human pancreatic cancer by inhibiting LTA4H activity. Our findings identify LTA4H as a functionally important
target for mediating the anticancer properties of resveratrol. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9755–64. 2010 AACR.

Considerable attention has been focused on the anticancer
effect of red wine (1–3), which contains several types of
polyphenolic compounds such as resveratrol (3,5,40 -trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) and quercetin (3,30 ,40 ,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone; Fig. 1A). Previous reports indicate that resveratrol
exerts antitumor effects in the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–initiated/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)promoted 2-stage skin cancer model (4). The chemopreventive
effects of resveratrol seem to be associated with tumor
initiation, promotion, and progression (5). Resveratrol was
reported to suppress cell transformation and induce apoptosis
through a p53-dependent pathway (6) and ERKs and p38mediated resveratrol-induced apoptosis (7, 8). Moreover,
resveratrol suppresses colon cancer cell growth by inhibiting
COX-2 activity (9). Resveratrol is a key substance in the cancer
preventive activity of red wine (10, 11). However, quercetin
also was suggested as an anticarcinogenic polyphenol (12, 13).
Previous reports indicated that quercetin suppressed

TPA-induced transformation of JB6 Pþ cells (14) and induced
apoptosis (15).
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) is a bifunctional zinc
metalloenzyme with anion-dependent aminopeptidase and
epoxide hydrolase activities (16). LTA4H is overexpressed in
certain human cancers (17). It catalyzes the hydrolysis of the
epoxide leukotriene A4 (LTA4) to leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which
stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines and
mediators (18, 19) and also stimulates cancer cell proliferation
(20–22). Moreover, previous studies indicate that inhibiting
LTA4H activity reduces the incidence of cancer and these
effects are associated with the inhibition of LTB4 biosynthesis
(23). We previously reported that [6]-gingerol suppresses
colon cancer growth by attenuating LTA4H activity (24).
In the present study, we found that resveratrol directly
bound to LTA4H and suppressed proliferation and anchorageindependent growth by inhibiting LTA4H activity in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, our findings showed that by inhibiting LTA4H activity, resveratrol suppressed tumor growth of
MIA PaCa-2 cells implanted in nude mice. These data suggest
that inhibition of LTA4H activity by resveratrol might be a
novel target for the prevention of pancreatic cancer.

Figure 1. Resveratrol specifically binds to LTA4H. A, chemical structures of resveratrol, RSVL3, and quercetin. B, multiple views of the binding pocket of LTA4H
shown through surface representations. The entrance into the binding pocket (red box) is located above the Zn ion. Therefore, inhibitors such as resveratrol,
must traverse through the binding pocket, past the Zn ion, and bind in the back-end pocket of the L-shaped cavity, which is nonsurface accessible
(black box). C, top-down view of the docked binding orientations of resveratrol and quercetin in LTA4H. The induced-fit extra-precision (IF-XP) docking
protocol returned 2 possible docking modes for both molecules. The resveratrol from the X-ray structure was docked back into the protein structure in the
exact same location as was found in the crystal structure. This location was energetically no different than resveratrol binding and interacting with the
Zn metal as determined by the IF-XP method. However, the lone XP docking method showed that binding in the back-end pocket (crystal structure binding
location) was energetically more favorable (4 kcal/mol) than the interaction with Zn. Quercetin is similar in shape and size to resveratrol and exhibited different
binding modes as well. However, the IF-XP method showed a dramatic difference in binding preference. The docking indicated that the back-end
pocket binding (green square) was preferred by 8 kcal/mol over the binding and interaction with the Zn metal. Asp375 played an important role in either
anchoring or binding orientation, but hydrogen bonds of quercetin with the protein backbone of Val367 and Ser379 likely caused its better binding energy.
Therefore, the preferred binding of quercetin is the same as that for resveratrol, in the back-end binding pocket of LTA4H. D, binding of resveratrol,
RSVL3, and quercetin to LTA4H. In vitro (top) and ex vivo (bottom) binding was confirmed by pull-down assay. Recombinant LTA4H or a lysate prepared from
MIA PaCa-2 cells was incubated with resveratrol-, RSVL3-, or quercetin-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads, or with Sepharose 4B beads alone, and the pulled
down proteins were analyzed by Western blot (WB).

Resveratrol, a Red Wine Polyphenol, Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer

Proliferation Assay kit was from Promega. The LTA4H human
recombinant protein (rLTA4H), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), antibodies against LTA4H and the LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1) for
Western blot, and the LTB4 EIA kit were purchased from
Cayman Chemical. The 29mer sh-RNA constructs against
LTA4H were from OriGene Technologies Inc. A methylated
derivative of resveratrol, 3,40 ,5-triemethoxy-trans-stilbene
(RSVL3; Fig. 1A), was a gift from Dr. Chi-Tang Ho, Department
of Food Science, Rutgers University.
Cell culture and transfection
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and were cytogenetically tested and authenticated
before the cells were frozen. Each vial of frozen cells was
thawed and maintained in culture for a maximum of 8 weeks.
Enough frozen vials were available for each cell line to ensure
that all cell-based experiments were conducted on cells that
had been tested and in culture for 8 weeks or less. The HCT15,
H1299, and LNCaP cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium/10% FBS. The SK-Br-3 cell line was cultured in
McCoy's 5A medium/10% FBS. The MIA PaCa-2 and PANC1 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM)/10% FBS. The HepG2 cell line was maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)/10%
FBS. Human pancreatic duct–derived (hTERT-HPNE) cells
were cultured in M3:5 growth medium [4 parts DMEM to 1
part M3F (INCELL) and 5% FCS; ref. 25]. All cell lines were
cultured with antibiotics at 37 C in a CO2 incubator. For
transfection, MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded (1  105) in 6-well
plates a day before transfection and expression vectors were
transfected transiently using jetPEI (Obiogen Inc.) for 48 hours
following the supplier's instructions.
Shape similarity methodology
A shape similarity method was used to search for biological targets of resveratrol and quercetin on the basis of their
respective structures. The PHASE module of Schr€
odinger's
molecular modeling software package was used to perform
the shape similarity search (26). The atom-type information
from the queries was also used not only to consider shape
similarity but also to align potential pharmacophore points
between the queries and the targets. The target library
comprised crystallized ligands taken from the Protein Data
Bank (PDB; ref. 27). To provide more structure orientations
for possible alignment, the maximum number of conformers
per molecule in the library to be generated was set to
100 while retaining at most 10 conformers per rotatable
bond. The top aligned structure for each molecule searched
was returned, when conformers with a Tanimoto similarity
coefficient below 0.7 were filtered out (28). A PDB ID was
associated with each aligned target molecule to make
searching the online PDB archive for the experimental
determined structure containing the "hit" ligand possible.
In this way, LTA4H (PDB 3cho) was identified as a potential
protein target because of its shape and pharmacophore
similarity with 2-amino-N-[4-(phenyl methoxy)phenyl]acetamide, a known LTA4H potent inhibitor, and both the
polyphenols, resveratrol and quercetin.

Computer modeling
During the course of this project, the crystal structure of
LTA4H bound to resveratrol (PDB 3fts) was solved along with
20 other structures bound with small molecular fragments. An
alignment of all available 39 LTA4H crystal structures showed

that an overall less than 1 A root mean square deviation
(RMSD) existed among them. The structural similarity search
permitted us to choose only the crystal structure of resveratrol
bound to LTA4H for docking studies. The protein was prepared for docking following the standard procedure outlined
in Schr€
odinger's GLIDE docking package. A total of 8 different
docking protocols were tested to determine which could best
reproduce the crystal structure orientations of all the crystallized LTA4H ligands extracted from 36 of the crystal structures. This method of validation was used to ensure a higher
degree of accuracy in the orientation of the docked quercetin
molecule.
The crystal structure orientations of all ligands, with the
exception of resveratrol and quercetin, were used as their
starting orientation for docking. Resveratrol and quercetin
were both built from the beginning and energetically minimized followed by 10,000 step conformational searches and
then reminimized creating the most energetically favorable
conformation needed for docking studies. For the protein, all

crystallographic waters were deleted and a 30-A3 grid was
generated on the binding site of resveratrol to define the
protein receptor.
Four GLIDE docking protocols, including docking with
standard precision (SP) or extra precision (XP) and with or
without the catalytic Zn metal, were employed. These preliminary docking runs were followed by the more CPU-intensive induced-fit docking methods, which were conducted with
SP docking, a Zn metal, and either with or without waters. The
final 2 docking protocols tested used the induced-fit XP
docking with no waters but with or without the Zn metal.
A visual comparison between each returned docking pose to
its starting crystal structure orientation was done and used as
the measure for correct docking.
In vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays
Recombinant LTA4H (0.5 mg) or lysates from MIA PaCa-2
cells (500 mg) were mixed with resveratrol-, RSVL3-, or quercetin-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads or with Sepharose 4B
beads alone as a control (50 mL, 50% suspension) and binding
was determined by Western blot (24).
LTB4 production assay
Cells were seeded (1  105) into 6-well plates and cultured
for 24 hours. The cells were treated with culture medium
containing different concentrations of resveratrol, RSVL3,
quercetin, or bestatin for 48 hours at 37 C in a CO2 incubator.
LTB4 production in the medium was quantified using the LTB4
EIA kit following the supplier's instructions.
Proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assay
For proliferation, cells were seeded (2  103) into 96-well
plates and treated with different concentrations of resveratrol,

RSVL3, quercetin, or LTB4. After incubation for various (24, 48,
or 72 hours) amounts of time in a 5% CO2 incubator, proliferation was determined as described (24). For anchorageindependent growth, cells (8  103/well) were suspended in
1 mL of BME supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.33% agar and
plated with various concentrations of resveratrol, RSVL3,
quercetin, bestatin, or LTB4 on 3 mL of solidified BME
supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5% agar with different
concentrations of resveratrol, RSVL3, quercetin, bestatin, or
LTB4. Colonies were determined as described (24).
In vivo xenograft mouse model
Athymic nude mice [Cr:NIH(S), NIH Swiss nude, 6–8 weeks
old] were purchased from Charles River. Animals were maintained under "specific pathogen free" conditions and all
animal studies were conducted according to guidelines
approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Animals were acclimated for 2 weeks
before the study and had free access to food and water. The
animals were housed in climate-controlled quarters with a 12hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Animals were randomly assigned to the following groups:
vehicle group (n ¼ 15), 10 mg/kg resveratrol group (n ¼ 15),
50 mg/kg resveratrol group (n ¼ 15), and 50 mg/kg resveratrol control group (n ¼ 15). Each mouse was administrated
resveratrol (10 or 50 mg/kg body weight in 100 mL of 70%
ethanol in autoclaved water as vehicle) or only vehicle 5
per week by oral gavage. After 2 weeks of treatment, MIA
PaCa-2 cells (1  106 cells) were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of mice in the respective groups. Following injection, mice continued to be administered resveratrol
or vehicle. Mice in the 50 mg/kg resveratrol control group
were not injected with cells but maintained for comparison
of body weight and tumor development. Mice were weighed
and tumors measured by caliper 3 per week. Tumor
volume was calculated from measurements of 2 diameters
of the individual tumor according to the following formula:
tumor volume (mm3) ¼ (length  width  height  0.52).
Mice were monitored until tumors reached 1-cm3 total
volume, at which time mice were euthanized and tumors
were extracted.
Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are expressed as means  SE or SD as
indicated. The Student's t test or a 1-way ANOVA was used for
statistical analysis. A probability of P < 0.05 was used as the
criterion for statistical significance.

Results
Resveratrol specifically binds to LTA4H
To elucidate potential targets of resveratrol or quercetin, we
first conducted in silico screening by using a shape similarity
approach. Resveratrol and quercetin (Fig. 1A) were screened
against all the crystallized ligands available from the PDB.
Screening results showed that both polyphenols were very
similar to 2-amino-N-[4-(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]acetamide, a
known LTA4H inhibitor, which implied that LTA4H was a

9758

possible molecular target for resveratrol or quercetin. The
crystal structure of resveratrol bound to LTA4H (PDB 3fts) was
recently solved during a fragment screen crystallography
research program that was undertaken to find novel inhibitors
of LTA4H (29). The fragment-based crystallography program
yielded 20 LTA4H structures bound to a variety of molecular
fragments increasing the total number of available LTA4H
crystal structures to 39. Our shape similarity search found the
ligand crystallized to LTA4H (PDB 3cho). However, we wanted
to know whether the new 3fts structure might be a more
appropriate protein for our docking experiments. An alignment of all 39 structures showed that the protein backbone

RMSD was less than 1 A (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This finding
provided the necessary validation to choose the resveratrol/
LTA4H complex (PDB 3fts) for docking calculations.
The alignment yielded additional insights into the structure
of LTA4H. The binding groove seems to be very hydrophilic
and therefore capable of binding an inordinate number of
waters (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The clustering of the water
molecules shows that they possess a highly precise location of
binding unless specifically displaced by a bound ligand. The
size and dimension of the L-shape binding groove is seen
when creating surface representations of all the bound ligands
(Fig. 1B). The crystallized orientations of resveratrol (PDB 3fts)
and bestatin (i.e., the first solved LTA4H inhibitor crystal
complex, PDB 1hs6) show 2 different binding modes observed
for all the inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Inhibitors of
LTA4H bind by interacting either with the catalytic Zn ion
(bestatin) or with the back portion of the binding groove
(resveratrol). The binding location of resveratrol is considered
to be the back because the opening into the binding site is near
the Zn molecule. The preferred binding of quercetin was the
same as that for resveratrol (Fig. 1C).
To validate the results of the shape similarity search, we
conducted in vitro pull-down assays by using resveratrol- or
quercetin-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads. The initial computer docking data using the PDB 3cho crystal structure showed
that the hydroxyl groups of resveratrol are important for
binding to LTA4H. We compared the binding of RSVL3, a
methylated derivative of resveratrol (Fig. 1A). Our data showed
that recombinant LTA4H (rLTA4H) bound to resveratrol- or
quercetin-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads but not to RSVL3conjugated beads in vitro (Fig. 1D, top). We then used MIA
PaCa-2 cell lysates to perform an ex vivo binding assay. Results
indicated that resveratrol-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads
bound to endogenous LTA4H whereas RSVL3- or quercetinconjugated beads did not (Fig. 1D, bottom). These results
suggest that resveratrol might be a more effective agent
against LTA4H than quercetin and its hydroxyl groups are
required for the binding.
LTA4H expression and LTB4 production are increased
in pancreatic cancer cells
We then determined the abundance of LTA4H in several
cancer cell lines and found that LTA4H expression was relatively higher in pancreatic, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 2A). On the basis of findings that LTB4
stimulates cancer cell proliferation (20–22), we measured

LTB4 production in several cancer cell lines. Our results
showed that MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells produced
relatively large amounts of LTB4 compared with other cancer
cell lines (Fig. 2B). We also determined expression levels of
LTA4H in normal pancreatic cells (hTERT-HPNE cells) and an
additional pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. LTA4H expression is higher in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells than in hTERTHPNE cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A), suggesting that LTA4H
might be associated with pancreatic cancer development.

www.aacrjournals.org

LTA4H activity is required for growth of MIA PaCa-2
cells
To investigate the role of LTA4H in pancreatic cancer cells,
we created LTA4H knockdown MIA PaCa-2 cells that express
small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting LTA4H. The expression
levels of LTA4H and BLT1, a specific receptor for LTB4, were
substantially reduced by knockdown of LTA4H compared with
sh-mock cells (Fig. 3A) and LTB4 production also reduced in
sh-LTA4H cells (Fig. 3B). Previous findings indicate that
inhibition of LTB4 production can suppress pancreatic cancer
growth (30). Our data indicated that knockdown of LTA4H
reduced anchorage-independent cell growth (Fig. 3C) and
inhibited proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2A) compared
with sh-mock cells. LTB4 was reported to stimulate pancreatic
cancer cell growth mediated by extracellular signal regulated
kinases (ERK; ref. 31). Our results also showed that LTB4
stimulated anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 3D) and proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Moreover, phosphorylation of ERKs (Thr202, Tyr204) was increased
by LTB4 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These results
suggest that LTA4H is associated with pancreatic cancer cell
growth mediated through ERKs signaling.
Resveratrol suppresses proliferation and anchorageindependent cell growth by inhibiting LTA4H activity
We then compared the effects of resveratrol, RSVL3, or
quercetin on several aspects of MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer
cells. Bestatin, a well-known inhibitor of LTA4H activity (32),
was used as a positive control. Our data showed that resveratrol suppressed LTB4 production in a dose-dependent manner whereas RSVL3 or quercetin had no effect (Fig. 4A). We
then determined the effect of resveratrol on proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth. Results indicated that resveratrol suppressed proliferation whereas the RSVL3 or quercetin was much less effective (Fig. 4B). Resveratrol strongly
suppressed anchorage-independent cell growth, whereas
RSVL3 (30 mmol/L) had a slight effect and quercetin (up to
30 mmol/L) exerted no effect (Fig. 4C). The inhibitory effect
of resveratrol on anchorage-independent cell growth was
stronger than that of bestatin (30 mmol/L). Resveratrol also
suppressed proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3B) and anchorage-independent growth in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). LTB4 is known to contribute to
BLT1 expression (33) and therefore resveratrol might suppress
BLT1 expression due to its inhibition of LTB4 production. Our
data showed that resveratrol, indeed, inhibited the expression
level of BLT1 dose-dependently (Fig. 5A, left) and the effect
was stronger than that of bestatin (Fig. 5A, right). In contrast,
RSVL3 or quercetin exerted no effect (Fig. 5A, right). On the
other hand, resveratrol did not affect LTA4H protein expression (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that resveratrol suppresses pancreatic cancer cell growth by inhibiting LTA4H
activity and is more potent than bestatin.
The effects of resveratrol are reduced by knockdown
of LTA4H
To investigate whether the effects of resveratrol are mediated
directly through LTA4H, we compared the effects of MIA PaCa-2

had less effect in sh-LTA4H cells (Fig. 5B). In anchorageindependent growth, the inhibitory effect of resveratrol was
also reduced in sh-LTA4H cells compared with sh-mock cells
(Fig. 5C). These results suggest that LTA4H is a direct target for
resveratrol to suppress growth of pancreatic cancer cells.

analyzed for LTA4H expression and LTB4 production. Results
indicated that resveratrol suppressed LTB4 production in
tumors (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, resveratrol did not affect
LTA4H protein expression (Fig. 6D). Overall, these results
suggest that resveratrol might serve as an effective agent
against pancreatic cancer by targeting LTA4H.

Discussion
Resveratrol suppresses tumor growth by inhibiting
LTA4H activity
We then determined whether resveratrol could suppress
tumor development in a xenograft model in vivo. Oral administration of resveratrol (10 or 50 mg/kg body weight) resulted
in a significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with the
vehicle-treated group. In the vehicle group, 10 of 15 (66.7%)
mice developed tumors, whereas only 6 of 15 (40%) or 4 or 15
(26.7%) mice developed tumors in the 10 or 50 mg/kg resveratrol group, respectively (Fig. 6A). The average tumor volume
per mouse was also decreased from 337 mm3 in the vehicle
group to 223 or 147 mm3 in the 10 mg/kg or 50 kg/kg
resveratrol group, respectively (Fig. 6B). To further determine
whether the antitumor effect of resveratrol in vivo was
associated with LTA4H, tumor extracts were prepared and

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer
death in the United States, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of
5% (34). In recent years, many dietary compounds have been
recognized as anticancer agents and previous studies indicate
that resveratrol suppresses growth of pancreatic cancer cells
(35–37). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
effect of resveratrol are unknown. Our results herein show a
role for resveratrol as a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent against pancreatic cancer and strongly suggest
that LTA4H is an important target.
Previous reports indicate that inactivating LTA4H results in
the suppression of inflammatory diseases in animal models (18,
19), making LTA4H a recognized anti-inflammatory target.

Figure 4. Resveratrol suppresses proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells. A, resveratrol inhibits LTB4 production, whereas
RSVL3 and quercetin have no effect. Cells were treated for 48 hours with resveratrol, RSVL3, quercetin (0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 mmol/L), or bestatin (30 mmol/L). LTB4
production was estimated by ELISA. B, resveratrol, but not RSVL3 or quercetin, inhibits MIA PaCa-2 proliferation. Cells were cultured with resveratrol, RSVL3,
or quercetin (0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 mmol/L) and proliferation was estimated at 24-hour intervals up to 72 hours. C, resveratrol, but not RSVL3 or quercetin,
suppresses anchorage-independent MIA PaCa-2 cell growth. Cells were grown with resveratrol, RSVL3, quercetin (0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 mmol/L), or bestatin (30
mmol/L) in soft agar for 5 days and then colonies were counted. Data are represented as means  SD from 3 different experiments. The asterisk (*) indicates a
significant decrease compared with untreated control cells (P < 0.05).

Figure 5. Resveratrol suppresses BLT1 expression, and binding to LTA4H is required for the inhibitory effects of resveratrol. A, resveratrol suppresses the
expression levels of BLT1 but has no effect on LTA4H expression. Cells were treated with resveratrol, RSVL3, quercetin, or bestatin for 72 hours and cell lysates
were analyzed by Western blot (WB). B, resveratrol has less effect on proliferation of sh-LTA4H cells than that of sh-mock cells. Cells were transfected
transiently for 48 hours with sh-mock or sh-LTA4H. Both cell types were treated with 30 mmol/L of resveratrol and proliferation was measured at 24-hour
intervals up to 72 hours. C, resveratrol has less effect on anchorage-independent growth of sh-LTA4H cells than that of sh-mock cells. Cells were grown in soft
agar with resveratrol (0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 mmol/M) for 5 days and colonies were counted. Data are represented as means  SD from 3 different experiments. The
asterisk (*) indicates a significant decrease compared with sh-mock cells (P < 0.05).

cell proliferation induced by LTB4 (31) were reported. Thus,
LTA4H and LTB4 are possible targets for suppressing cancer
cell progression (17). Our data showed that the LTA4H protein
level and LTB4 production are higher in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic
cancer cells than other cancer cells (Fig. 2). Moreover, anchorage-independent growth of MIA PaCa-2 cells was decreased by
knockdown of LTA4H (Fig. 3C) and enhanced by treatment
with LTB4 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that LTA4H activity
might play an important role in pancreatic cancer cell growth.
The anticancer activities of resveratrol were first shown by
Jang and colleagues (5) in a 2-stage mouse skin cancer model.
Our results herein indicate that resveratrol directly binds to
LTA4H (Fig. 1C) and strongly suppresses anchorage-independent growth of MIA PaCa-2 cells by inhibiting LTA4H activity
(Fig. 4) and BLT1 expression (Fig. 5A). Recently, Davies and
colleagues (29) reported that resveratrol directly bound to
LTA4H as determined by X-ray crystallography. This report
strongly supports our findings that LTA4H is a direct target of
resveratrol. Harikumar and colleagues (36) reported that
resveratrol suppressed pancreatic cancer cell growth through
inhibition of NF-kB activation. LTB4 is reported to increase
NF-kB DNA binding activity (38). These reports suggest that
suppression of pancreatic cancer growth by resveratrol is
associated with inhibition of LTA4H activity. On the other

hand, resveratrol is reported to have no effect on growth of
PANC-1 cells (39). In that report, cell density was 10-fold
higher than in our study and might explain why resveratrol
could not suppress cell growth. Others (40) reported that
resveratrol had no effect on BOP-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamsters. In this case, hamsters were fed resveratrol in their diet whereas we fed resveratrol by gavage, a
method that more tightly controls the dose consumed.
We (9) previously reported that the anticancer effect of
resveratrol is mediated directly by COX-2 and RSVL3 had no
effect most likely because of its low binding affinity. Our
present results indicated that RSVL3 did not bind to LTA4H
(Fig. 1D) and exerts no effect on pancreatic cancer cell growth
(Fig. 4). These findings indicate that the anticancer effects of
resveratrol on pancreatic cancer are mediated directly
through LTA4H and the hydroxyl groups of resveratrol seem
to be required for binding with LTA4H. Our results also
showed that quercetin bound to rLTA4H in vitro but did
not bind to LTA4H ex vivo (Fig. 1D). MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)
and Raf were reported as direct molecular targets of quercetin
(14). This suggests that quercetin likely binds to other proteins
with much higher affinity than does LTA4H ex vivo, which
could result in a competition for binding resulting in much
weaker binding in cells.

Figure 6. Resveratrol suppresses tumor growth by inhibiting LTA4H activity in vivo. Athymic nude mice were treated as described in the Materials and Methods
section, and tumor volume was measured and recorded 3 times a week. A, resveratrol reduces the number of tumor-bearing mice. B, resveratrol suppresses
tumor volume in vivo. C, LTB4 production is reduced in resveratrol-treated tumors. LTB4 levels were analyzed by ELISA and the amount of LTB4 is expressed as
picograms/milligram of protein. D, expression of LTA4H in vehicle- or resveratrol-treated tumors (n ¼ 3). For A and B, data are represented as means  SE and
differences were determined by 1-way ANOVA. The asterisk (*) indicates a significant decrease versus vehicle-treated groups (P < 0.05). For C, data are
represented as means  SD and significance is determined by Student's t test. The asterisk (*) indicates a significant decrease versus vehicle group (P < 0.05).

In conclusion, we provided evidence showing that resveratrol suppresses anchorage-independent growth of MIA
PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting LTA4H activity.
In a xenograft mouse model, our results indicated that
promotion of pancreatic cancer could be delayed or suppressed by resveratrol and the effect is associated with the
inhibition of LTA4H activity. Collectively, these findings
support the anticancer effect of resveratrol mediated
through LTA4H for the prevention of pancreatic cancer
progression.
