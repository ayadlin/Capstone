ABSTRACT:
T-ALL patients treated with intensive chemotherapy achieve high rates of
remission. However, frequent long-term toxicities and relapses into chemotherapyrefractory tumors constitute major clinical challenges which could be met by targeted
therapies. c-MYC is a central oncogene in T-ALL, prompting the exploration of the
efficacy of MYC inhibitors such as JQ1 (BET-bromodomain inhibitor), and SAHA (HDAC
inhibitor). Using a standardized ex vivo drug screening assay, we show here that JQ1
and SAHA show competitive efficiency compared to inhibitors of proteasome, PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and NOTCH pathways, and synergize in combination with Vincristine. We
also compared for the first time the in vivo relevance of such associations in mice
xenografted with human primary T-ALLs. Our data indicate that although treatments
combining JQ1 or SAHA with chemotherapeutic regimens might represent promising
developments in T-ALL, combinations will need to be tailored to specific subgroups
of responsive patients, the profiles of which still remain to be precisely defined.

INTRODUCTION

chemoresistance.
Among the numerous oncogenes/tumor suppressors
reported in T-ALL, MYC has recently gained a central
role [2-5]. MYC alterations are rarely found in T-ALL
(<5%), yet indirect upregulation by multiple frequently
deregulated pathways makes it one of the most frequently
activated oncogenes in T-ALL. In ~50% T-ALLs,
increased MYC transcription results from NOTCH
mutations [2-4]. In another large fraction of cases, MYC
is activated post-translationally, via mutations in FBXW7
or PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, impairing sequential
ubiquitinations or phosphorylations driving its degradation
[6-8]. By providing many escape routes for resistance to

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL)
are aggressive proliferations of transformed T-cell
progenitors. Although intensification of chemotherapeutic
schedules greatly improved prognosis in the past 10
years, ~30% of cases relapse within the first 2 years
following diagnosis [1]; for long-term survivors, acute
and lasting toxicities remain important issues underlining
the critical need of more adapted/targeted therapies,
and better risk stratification. This, however, requires a
detailed understanding of T-ALL oncogenic networks,
and of escape pathways involved in acquisition of

inhibitors, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and NOTCH pathways
inhibitors (Supplemental Table S1). Optimal windows of
drug molarities were first established by pre-screening,
and a more focused panel of 4 serial dilutions was used
to determine, for a given T-ALL, the average EC50 value
of drugs tested side by side (Fig. 1A). As expected, most
non-targeted chemotherapeutic agents displayed efficient
inhibitory activity across all cell-lines. Among inhibitors
and epigenetic regulators, SAHA and JQ1 combined low
EC50, relatively low molarity, and a large spectrum of
activity across all T-ALLs (Fig. 1A). Ex vivo functional
assays on cell cycle and viability showed that while SAHA
treatment induced a cytotoxic effect (similar to Vincristine
or Bortezomib), JQ1 mainly induced a cytostatic effect
(Fig. 1B and Supplemental Fig. S2). This is in line with
a previous report on human T-ALL cell-lines [5], but
contrasts with ex vivo treatments performed on mouse
cell-lines and primary human samples (post-culture
on stroma and/or in vivo amplification in mice), where
apoptosis could also be observed upon JQ1 treatment
[13]. We next monitored the effect of JQ1 and SAHA on

therapies targeting afferent pathways (e.g. γ-secretase or
AKT inhibitors) [8-10], the complexity of MYC circuitry
supports the rationale of directly targeting MYC (or direct
MYC regulators).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
HDAC inhibitors (e.g. SAHA) have been shown to
decrease MYC expression levels, although the mechanism
is still unclear and undoubtedly non-specific [11]. More
recently, the development of BET-bromodomain inhibitors
such as JQ1, and the demonstration that it can efficiently
inhibit MYC expression via disruption of BRD4containing transcriptional elongation complexes has
triggered great interest [5, 12-15].
To evaluate the potency of SAHA and JQ1
compared to other inhibitors of key T-ALL pathways, we
performed a standardized drug screen of cell proliferation/
viability (Supplemental Fig. S1). Eight human T-ALL
cell-lines were tested with 8 chemotherapeutic agents and
8 compounds including epigenetic regulators, proteasome

MYC expression. Both transcriptional and protein levels
were examined since MYC regulation is impaired at both
post-transcriptional and post-translational levels in T-ALL
[6]. As expected, relative MYC protein and RNA levels
were strongly diminished in all T-ALL cell-lines treated
with JQ1 or SAHA, when compared to Vincristine or
Bortezomib (Fig. 1C and Supplemental Fig. S3). We next
tested whether the inhibitory effect of JQ1 and/or SAHA
could be potentialized in combination with Vincristine,

frequently included in T-ALL regimens. A synergistic
effect was observed for both combinations (Fig. 1D),
supporting the rationale of associating BET bromodomain
inhibitors or HDAC inhibitors in T-ALL regimens.
The effect of in vivo treatment with these inhibitors
has so far not been evaluated in human primary T-ALLs.
To further validate the relevance of treatments and
associations in an in vivo setting, we tested the effect
of SAHA, JQ1, Vincristine and combinations in NSG

and in vivo drug treatment assays. NOD/SCID/γc (NSG) mice are grafted with human primary blasts. Following leukemia development,
mice are sacrificed, and blasts from spleens are transplanted in secondary recipient mice for amplification (1-2 rounds). For drug
treatments, a set of ~25 NSG mice are engrafted with 1.106 cells issued from the same tumor bulk (from amplification step). Upon
appearance of hCD45+ human blasts in blood (1-25/µl), mice are divided into pools of 5-6 for drug treatments. Treatments were run
over 21 days with indicated schedules: SAHA and JQ1 were injected (ip) 5 days weekly (red boxes); Vincristine was injected (ip) 1 day
weekly (hatched boxes); NT: control mice, not treated; Blood samples were drawn at days d0, d14 and d21 post-treatment; mice were
sacrificed at d21, and spleens harvested. (B) hCD45+ blasts were quantified by FACS; concentrations of hCD45+ cells/µl of blood (top

mice xenografted with primary human T-ALL samples
(Fig. 2A). Four consecutive fresh samples were directly
transplanted into 1-4 mice, without previous amplification
or selection on DL1-expressing stroma, to prevent
selective bias of NOTCH-addicted (and consequently
MYC-dependent) tumors. Among the four xenografted
mice, three (T-ALL#2, T-ALL#3 and T-ALL#4) induced
T-ALL in less than 4 months. When leukemia-related first
symptoms were observed mice were sacrificed and human
leukemic cells from spleens harvested for secondary
engraftments (amplification step). Then, leukemic blasts
of T-ALL#2, T-ALL#3 and T-ALL#4 from secondary
xenografts were transplanted (106 cells/mouse) into 25
recipient mice each. Upon appearance of hCD45+ blasts
in blood (~5 weeks, 1-25 hCD45+/µl), pools of 5-6 mice
were mock- or drug-treated. For each mouse, circulating
hCD45+ blasts were quantified by FACS at day 0, and
d14/d21 post-treatment. At d21, mice were sacrificed,
spleens harvested, weighed and blasts quantified as above
(Fig. 2B Supplemental Fig. S4). In all xenografted mice,
treatment with Vincristine induced a significant decrease
in hCD45+ leukemic cell proliferation in spleen and blood
at all time-points. For T-ALL#2 and #3, treatments with
JQ1 also significantly inhibited tumor progression and
spleen size/weight. Similar results were obtained with
SAHA in T-ALL#3, while in T-ALL#2 SAHA showed the
best efficiency. Remarkably, Vincristine+JQ1 or SAHA
combinations further decreased progression, in line with
the synergistic effect observed in ex vivo assays. By
contrast, treatments of T-ALL#4 with JQ1 or SAHA did not
induce significant growth inhibition, and Vincristine+JQ1
combination did not enhance the inhibitory effect of
Vincristine alone. Importantly, this differential effect of
JQ1 or SAHA treatment in vivo could not be foreseen on
the basis of an ex vivo apoptosis assay (Supplemental Fig.
S5) where efficiency was uniform, as previously reported
[13]. Nonetheless, this differential effect between patients
was coherent with MYC expression in transplanted tumors
(medium/high in T-ALL#2 and 3, low in T-ALL#4, Fig.
2C). This suggests that at least part of the effect of JQ1
and SAHA on leukemia inhibition in vivo is directly or
indirectly mediated through MYC or MYC-dependent
pathways. This also suggested that contrary to T-ALL
cell lines, most of which express high levels of MYC (not
shown, potentially as a result of selection/adaptation in
ex vivo cell culture) and to experimental T-ALL mouse
models of Notch activation (in which MYC activation is
systematic and homogeneous), primary human T-ALL
might display more complex/diverse MYC addiction. In
support of this possibility, the effect of JQ1 and SAHA
on MYC modulation ex vivo appeared heterogeneous in
a series of 6 human primary T-ALLs, with 2/6 showing
significant MYC decrease with both JQ1 and SAHA
(#3,#5), 3/6 showing significant decrease with only one of
the 2 drugs (#1,#2,#6) and 1/6 (#4) showing no significant
decrease with any of them (Fig. 2D).

Altogether our data indicate that although treatments
combining JQ1 or SAHA with chemotherapeutic regimens
might represent promising developments in T-ALL,
combinations will need to be tailored to specific subgroups
of patients, the profiles of which still remain to be
precisely defined. Although MYC itself might constitute
one element of these profiles, it will undoubtedly not be
the sole, considering both the extraordinary complexity of
MYC regulatory afferent and effector pathways and the
multiple other targets of BET-bromodomain and HDAC
inhibitors. Further studies on large cohorts of xenografted
primary T-ALL samples (and systematic comparison
with ex vivo assays) combined with extensive sample
characterization will be necessary to identify the key
components of such profiles, and ultimately determine
whether a sufficiently large subgroup of patients could be
eligible and benefit from such combination therapies.
