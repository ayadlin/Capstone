1,25D3 Enhances Antitumor Activity of
Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Human
Bladder Cancer Models
Yingyu Ma, MD, PhD1; Wei-Dong Yu, MD1; Donald L. Trump, MD2; and Candace S. Johnson, PhD1

BACKGROUND: 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) potentiates the cytotoxic effects of several common chemotherapeutic agents. The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is a current standard chemotherapy regimen for bladder
cancer. The authors investigated whether 1,25D3 could enhance the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in
bladder cancer model systems. METHODS: Human bladder cancer T24 and UMUC3 cells were pretreated with 1,25D3
followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V staining. Caspase activation was examined by immunoblot analysis and substrate-based caspase activity assay. The cytotoxic effects were examined by
using 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and in vitro clonogenic assay. p73 protein levels were assessed by immunoblot analysis. Knockdown of p73 was achieved by siRNA. The in vivo antitumor
activity was assessed by in vivo excision clonogenic assay and tumor regrowth delay in the T24 xenograft model.
RESULTS: 1,25D3 pretreatment enhanced gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced apoptosis and the activities of caspases
8, 9, and 3 in T24 and UMUC3 cells. 1,25D3 synergistically reduced gemcitabine and cisplatin-suppressed surviving
fraction in T24 cells. 1,25D3, gemcitabine, or cisplatin induced p73 accumulation, which was enhanced by gemcitabine
and cisplatin or 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin. p73 expression was lower in human primary bladder tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue. Knockdown of p73 increased clonogenic capacity of T24 cells treated
with 1,25D3, gemcitabine and cisplatin, or 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin. 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin
combination enhanced tumor regression compared with 1,25D3 or gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. CONCLUSIONS:

Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed and eighth leading cause of cancer death in men. In
2009, there are estimated 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in the United States and 14,330 individuals died
of bladder cancer.1 Combination treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin is the current standard chemotherapy regimen
for locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer.2,3 Although gemcitabine and cisplatin regimen is active in bladder cancer treatment, limited response rate and drug resistance remain major clinical problems. Therefore, new approaches to
treatment of bladder cancer are desirable.
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum [II]) is a DNA damaging agent that forms platinum-DNA adducts and
leads to apoptosis in tumor cells.4 Gemcitabine (20 ,20 -difluorodeoxycytidine) is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has structural and metabolic similarities with deoxycytidine and cytosine arabinoside.5 Its active metabolites
cause cytotoxicity by inhibiting DNA polymerase and being incorporated into DNA and, thereby, inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis.6
Both cisplatin and gemcitabine have been reported to increase the level of p73 protein, which contributes to drugmediated apoptosis in human colon cancer cells.7,8 As a p53 homologue, p73 is involved in cancer development. p73 gene
encodes 2 major groups of isoforms with opposite functions. The isoforms containing the transactivation domain

mice developed spontaneous tumors, most frequently
lung adenocarcinomas, and they were more sensitive to
carcinogens.10 These results demonstrated that TAp73
had tumor suppressor activity.10 The loss of TAp73a protein expression has been associated with advanced tumor
stage in bladder cancer.11
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), the most
active vitamin D metabolite, has broad spectrum antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo.12 The antitumor effects
of 1,25D3 are achieved through several mechanisms:
inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cancer cell differentiation, and suppressing angiogenesis.12 Epidemiological
and experimental studies support a role of 1,25D3 in cancer prevention and treatment.13,14 Low levels of plasma
vitamin D are associated with higher cancer incidence and
mortality in men in colorectal, breast, lung, and prostate
cancers.15-18 In addition, 1,25D3 potentiates the antitumor effects of common chemotherapeutic agents such as
paclitaxel, cisplatin, carboplatin, and doxorubicin.12 Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the role of 1,25D3,
alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents, in the treatment of several solid tumors.12
In this study, we investigate the role of 1,25D3 pretreatment in potentiating the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in human bladder cancer, in vitro and
in vivo, and the potential role of p73.

the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
Apoptosis Assay
T24 and UMUC3 cells were collected and stained with
PE-conjugated annexin V according to manufacturer’s
instructions as described previously.19
Immunoblot Analysis
T24 and UMUC3 cells were treated as indicated, harvested, and lysates prepared as previously described.19
Four pairs of primary human bladder tumors or adjacent
normal tissue were homogenized in lysis buffer using a homogenizer (Brinkmann Polytron PT 10 of 35). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described.19
Caspase Activity Assays
The activities of caspases-3, 8, and 9 were measured using
the Caspase-family Colorimetric Assay kit from R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, Minn) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Caspase activity was assessed by absorbance divided by protein loading.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assays and
Dose-Effect Analysis
T24 cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells
were treated with ethanol (EtOH) or pretreated with various concentrations (0.02 lM to 6 lM) of 1,25D3 for 24
hours and followed by the combination of gemcitabine
and cisplatin (gemcitabine dose range: 1.56 nM to 100
nM) for 48 hours. The ratio of gemcitabine to cisplatin
was fixed at 1:100. Cell growth was assessed by MTT
assay. Drug interactions were quantified by median-dose
effect analysis, and combination index values were derived
using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, Mo). Combination index values of <1, ¼1, and >1 indicate synergism, additive, and antagonism between the drugs,
respectively.
In Vitro Clonogenic Assay
T24 cells were pretreated with EtOH or 1 lM 1,25D3 for
24 hours followed by 1.25 nM gemcitabine and 0.1 lg/
mL cisplatin and subjected to the in vitro clonogenic
assays as described.20

siRNA (siRNA-NS), and DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colo). T24 cells
were transfected with 50 nM siRNA-NS or siRNA against
p73 for 48 hours using DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol.
In Vivo Excision Clonogenic Assay
The in vivo effect of 1,25D3 on gemcitabine and cisplatin-mediated antitumor activity was evaluated using a
human T24 xenograft tumor model. Adult homozygous
nude mice (Charles River Laboratories) were subcutaneously injected with 4  106 T24 cells, log-growth phase in
0.1 mL of Matrigel þ HBSS (1:1), in the right rear flank.
At Days 8-9 postimplantation, when the tumors were palpable (  6.5  5 mm), the mice (4/group) were treated
with saline, 1,25D3 (0.625 lg/mouse/d, on Days 1, 2,
and 3), gemcitabine (6 mg/mouse/d, qd  1, on Day 2),
cisplatin (0.12 mg/mouse/d, qd  1, on Day 3), or 3 drug
combination (1,25D3 þ gemcitabine and cisplatin).
Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, tumors were
harvested and in vivo excision clonogenic assay was performed as described.20
Tumor Regrowth Delay
The T24 xenograft tumor model was used and the mice
were treated as described in the in vivo excision clonogenic
assay. Tumor measurements were taken as described.21
Statistical Analyses
Statistical significances between groups were determined
by 2-tailed Student t test.

Vitamin D Receptor is Expressed in Human
Bladder Cancer Cells
1,25D3 exerts most of its activities through the VDR,
which is expressed in a wide range of cells and tissues.
VDR protein expression in human bladder cancer cell
lines T24 and UMUC3 were examined by immunoblot
analysis. T24 cells did not express detectable VDR and
1,25D3 induced VDR expression in a dose dependent
manner (Fig. 1). UMUC3 cells expressed a higher level of
endogenous VDR, which was markedly induced by
1,25D3 (Fig. 1).

1,25D3 Promotes Gemcitabine and
Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis
To examine whether 1,25D3 promotes gemcitabine and
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, T24
or UMUC3 cells were treated with vehicle control EtOH,
1,25D3, gemcitabine, cisplatin, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, or pretreated with 1,25D3 for 24
hours followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin for 48 hours,
and apoptosis was assessed by annexin V staining. 1,25D3
alone did not induce apoptosis in T24 (Fig. 2a) or
UMUC3 cells (Fig. 2b). Gemcitabine or cisplatin alone
induced apoptosis in T24 cells (Fig. 2a) and to a lesser
extent in UMUC3 cells (Fig. 2b). Apoptosis was slightly
increased by the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin
(Fig. 2a and b), which was further increased significantly
by the pretreatment with 1,25D3 (Fig. 2a and b). To
examine the involvement of caspases in 1,25D3 potentiation of gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced apoptosis, immunoblot analysis and substrate-based caspase activity
assay were used. 1,25D3 alone did not induce the cleavage
of caspases 8, 10, 9, 3, and PARP as compared with control in T24 cells (Fig. 3a). Gemcitabine or cisplatin alone
induced the cleavage of caspases 8, 9 and PARP, which
was not further enhanced by the combination treatments
(Fig. 3a). Increased cleavage of caspase 3 was observed
with the combination treatments (Fig. 3a). Similar results
were observed in UMUC3 cells, but to a lesser extent (Fig.
3a). The more quantitative caspase assays revealed that
gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment resulted in increased
activities of caspases 8, 9, and 3, which was significantly
(P < .05) enhanced by the pretreatment with 1,25D3 in
T24 cells (Fig. 3b-d). Together, these results indicate that
1,25D3 enhances gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, and this enhancement
involves the activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3.

24 hours, followed by 25 nM gemcitabine (Gem) and 0.75 lg/mL cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum[II]) (cDDP) for 48
hours. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-PE staining by flow cytometry. The populations of annexin V/7AAD, annexin Vþ/
7AAD, and annexin Vþ/7AADþ corresponded to live cells, early apoptotic cells, and late apoptotic cells. The results were summarized in a bar graph as mean  SD of annexin V positive cells in triplicate experiments and are representative of 2 independent
experiments. (b) UMUC3 cells were treated with EtOH or 1.5 lM 1,25D3 for 24 hours, followed by 0.15 lg/mL cisplatin and 100 nM

1,25D3 Promotes Gemcitabine and
Cisplatin-Mediated Growth Inhibition
Because 1,25D3 potentiated gemcitabine and cisplatininduced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells especially T24
cells, we next investigated their effects on growth inhibition using MTT assay. T24 cells were treated with a series
of doses of 1,25D3 for 24 hours after by varying doses of
gemcitabine and cisplatin, at a fixed ratio of 1:100, for 48
hours. MTT results showed that pretreatment with
1,25D3 resulted in enhanced growth inhibition compared
with gemcitabine and cisplatin combination (Fig. 4a).
Standard median-dose effect isobologram analysis22 was
used to evaluate the nature of the interaction between
1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin. The combination
index plotted against a series of treatment groups (Fig. 4b)
or fraction affected (Fig. 4c) showed that the interaction
between 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin was syner-

gistic at certain doses (combination index <1). The more
sensitive in vitro clonogenic assay revealed that 1,25D3
alone did not alter the clonogenic capacity of T24 cells
(Fig. 4d). The gemcitabine and cisplatin combination
markedly suppressed the surviving fraction (Fig. 4d); this
effect was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with
1,25D3 (Fig. 4d). These data indicate that 1,25D3 enhances gemcitabine and cisplatin-mediated growth
inhibition.

TAp73 (p73) were assessed by immunoblot analysis using
a monoclonal antibody targeting TAp73 but not DNp73
nor p53. Compared with the control, 1,25D3, gemcitabine, or cisplatin alone markedly increased p73 level in
T24 cells, which was further increased with the combination treatment (Fig. 5a). Likewise, p73 was increased in
UMUC3 cells, but more modestly (Fig. 5a). To better
understand the involvement of p73 in bladder cancer, p73
protein levels in primary human bladder cancer tissues
and adjacent normal tissues were examined by immunoblot analysis. Lower levels of p73 were observed in tumor
tissues compared with control normal adjacent tissues in 3

that increasing p73 level may be beneficial in treating

plays a role in the growth inhibition mediated by 1,25D3
and gemcitabine and cisplatin.
1,25D3 Enhances the Antitumor Activity of
Gemcitabine and Cisplatin In Vivo
Because 1,25D3 potentiated gemcitabine and cisplatinmediated growth inhibition in T24 cells in vitro, we next
investigated whether 1,25D3 had the same effects in vivo
using the T24 xenograft model. As an indication of in
vivo antitumor activity, in vivo excision clonogenic assay
revealed that 1,25D3 alone or gemcitabine and cisplatin

combination resulted in reduced surviving fraction (Fig.

the surviving fraction as compared with 1,25D3 (P < .01)
or the gemcitabine and cisplatin combination (P < .001)
(Fig. 6a).
To determine whether the results of in vivo excision
clonogenic assay translate to antitumor effect in vivo, T24

DISCUSSION
Metastatic bladder cancer has often been treated with
standard multidrug chemotherapy comprising methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin.3 However,
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin

regimen is highly toxic and better regimens were sought.
Gemcitabine and cisplatin combination is an effective regimen and has response rates, disease progression rates, and
overall survival rates comparable to methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin.24 Importantly, the gemcitabine and cisplatin regimen is much safer and better
tolerated.24 As a result, the gemcitabine and cisplatin regimen is widely accepted as a standard of care for patients
with advanced bladder cancer. However, the response
rates to these regimens are only around 50%.24 Inherent
or acquired drug resistance is frequently observed and
remains a major clinical problem. Tumor resistance to
gemcitabine or cisplatin occurs through many mechanisms, and among which the inactivation of apoptotic
pathways is a common and important mechanism.25,26
Therefore, the development of new treatment options to
increase chemosensitivity is needed.
1,25D3 has a broad spectrum of antitumor effects.12
It also additively or synergistically enhances antitumor
activities of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and
paclitaxel.12 Several mechanisms have been proposed for
the enhanced antitumor effects. 1,25D3 pretreatment followed by cisplatin increases the expression of mitogen
activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK-1) and caspase 3 activation, which may contribute to increased antitumor activity of cisplatin in squamous cell carcinoma
cells.27 1,25D3 sensitizes breast cancer cells to doxorubicin through the reduction of expression and activity of
cytoplasmic antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, which increases the oxidative damage by doxorubicin.28 1,25D3-mediated enhancement of the growth
inhibitory effects of paclitaxel is associated with increased
Bcl-2 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells29 and
decreased p21 in prostate cancer cells.21
1,25D3 signals primarily through its receptor,
VDR, which is a ligand-dependent transcription factor.
VDR expression is detected in bladder tumor tissues with
more positive cells in advanced tumor.30 Higher VDR
expression is associated with a higher rate of progression
in pathological stage.31 In comparison, VDR expression is
low in normal urothlium.30 In the current study, we
showed that both human bladder cancer cell lines T24
and UMUC3 expressed VDR, which was further induced
by 1,25D3. These results show that bladder cancer cells
are capable of responding to 1,25D3.
Our laboratory has demonstrated that the optimal
treatment schedule for greater cytotoxicity in the combination therapy is pretreatment with 1,25D3 for 24 hours
followed by chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and

paclitaxel.21,27,32 We investigated whether 1,25D3
induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells and whether pretreatment with 1,25D3 promotes gemcitabine and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these cells. By using annexin V
staining, we showed that 1,25D3, as a single agent, did
not induce apoptosis in T24 or UMUC3 cells. Pretreatment with 1,25D3 significantly enhanced apoptosis
induced by the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin
in both cell lines. Supporting these observations, 1,25D3
increased the activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3 induced by
gemcitabine and cisplatin. Furthermore, 1,25D3 promoted gemcitabine and cisplatin-mediated growth inhibition as assessed by the MTT assay and in vitro clonogenic
assay. The nature of the interaction between 1,25D3 and
gemcitabine and cisplatin was synergistic using standard
median-dose effect isobologram analysis. In line with our
observations, a previous study showed that IC50 of
1,25D3 in T24 and another bladder cancer cell line 253j
was 40 lM and low concentrations of 1,25D3, as used
in our current study, did not induce substantial
cytotoxicity.33
As a tumor suppressor, p53 is frequently mutated in
bladder cancers and p53 mutations are linked to tumor
progression and poor prognosis.34 In this case, the status
of p53 family member p73 may be important in tumor
development and chemosensitivity.35 p73 is induced by
various chemotherapeutic drugs and abrogation of p73
function results in chemoresistance.35 p53 family members also function as a network to modulate chemosensitivity. Mutant p53 has inhibitory effects on p73 and
knockdown of mutant p53 promotes chemosensitivity.35
A p53 polymorphism at codon 72 (72R or 72P) in head
and neck cancer is associated with the clinical response to
chemotherapy, and the p53 mutants that inhibit p73
function in vitro are associated with more resistance to
chemotherapy.36 A p53-derived peptide activates p73 and
induces p73-dependent apoptosis in vitro and tumor
regression in vivo.37 By using immunoblot analysis, we
showed that p73 expression was lower in bladder tumor in
3 of 4 pairs of adjacent normal tissue and tumor tissue. In
line with our finding, low p73a expression was detected
in 68% of primary human bladder tumors.11 The loss of
p73a expression is also associated with tumor stage.11 We
previously identified p73 as a target of 1,25D3, the level
of which increased upon 1,25D3 treatment.23 Here, we
show that 1,25D3 also induced the accumulation of p73
protein in bladder cancer cell lines, especially in T24 cells.

and cisplatin or the combination of 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin, suggesting that p73 plays a role in
growth inhibition mediated by these agents.
Furthermore, 1,25D3 potentiated gemcitabine and
cisplatin-mediated antitumor activity in vivo. T24 tumor
cell clonogenic ability was suppressed by 1,25D3 alone or
gemcitabine and cisplatin, and further suppressed by the
combination of 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin, as
assessed by in vivo excision clonogenic assay. Using the
T24 human bladder xenograft model, we showed that the
combination of 1,25D3 and gemcitabine and cisplatin
also resulted in greater tumor regression compared with
1,25D3 alone or gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment. It is
intriguing that 1,25D3 treatment alone did not induce apoptosis or growth inhibition in T24 cells in vitro; however, it exhibited antitumor effect in vivo. These
observations suggest 1,25D3 may have an impact on tumor microenvironment. One potential mechanism for
these observations is the effect of 1,25D3 on angiogenesis.
1,25D3 has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis in a variety of angiogenesis models.12
1,25D3 has been used in several clinical studies. The
early clinical trials of 1,25D3 were conducted in patients
with leukemia and myelodysplasia. Despite the prodifferentiation effect on leukemia blast cells in vitro, the results
in patients were disappointing because of the development of dose-limiting hypercalcemia.38,39 More recently,
multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that sufficient
doses of 1,25D3 to achieve exposure similar to those seen
in the in vitro models can be safely administered by high
dose intermittent regimen.40-43 Our group has conducted
several phase 1 trials of 1,25D3 in combination with
cytotoxic drug, including 1,25D3 þ paclitaxel and
1,25D3 þ carboplatin.44 Dose-limiting toxicity was not
encountered. These clinical trials provide evidence and
support for the continued study of 1,25D3 in combination with cytotoxic cancer chemotherapies.
In summary, this study reports that 1,25D3 enhances the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in
vitro and in vivo, and p73 induction may contribute to
this growth inhibition. The addition of 1,25D3 to the
gemcitabine and cisplatin regimen may increase the
chemosensitivity of bladder cancer and potentially a
better response rate to the gemcitabine and cisplatin
combination.
