Abstract
Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are considered adjuvants in
clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we investigated the modulation of γδ T cell–mediated tumor cell lysis
by TLR ligands. γδ T-cell cytotoxicity and granzyme A/B
production were enhanced after pretreatment of tumor cells
with TLR3 [poly(I:C)] or TLR7 ligand (imiquimod). We examined TLR3- and TLR7-expressing pancreatic adenocarcinomas,
squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck and lung carcinomas. Poly(I:C) treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinomas
followed by coculture with γδ T cells resulted in an upregulation of CD54 on the tumor cells. The interaction of CD54 and
the corresponding ligand CD11a/CD18 expressed on γδ T
cells is responsible for triggering effector function in γδ T
cells. Moreover, treatment with imiquimod downregulated
MHC class I molecules on tumor cells possibly resulting in a
reduced binding affinity for inhibitory receptor NKG2A
expressed on γδ T cells. These results indicate that TLR3
or TLR7 ligand stimulation of tumor cells enhances the cytotoxic activity of expanded γδ T cells of cancer patients in vitro.

Introduction
Circulating, as well as tumor-infiltrating, γδ T cells exert their
effector function by the production of high amounts of cytokines
[e.g., IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] and cytotoxic mediators, including perforin, granzymes, and TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (1, 2). Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells recognize aminobisphosphonates (APC dependent) and phosphorylated intermediates of
the bacterial nonmevalonate isoprenoid pathway (APC independent), so-called phosphoantigens (3). A synthetic phosphoantigen
analogue is bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP; ref. 4). Moreover,
high concentrations of isopententyl pyrophosphate, possibly produced due to a dysregulated mevalonate pathway in malignant
cells as well as ectopically expressed mitochondrial F1-ATPase/
apolipoprotein I complex on tumor cells, can selectively induce
γδ T-cell expansion (5, 6). In addition to the TCR-dependent recognition, activating killer receptor NKG2D (CD314) is involved in
the cytotoxic effector activity of γδ T cells (7, 8). NKG2D binds to

stress-inducible MHC class I chain–related antigens (MIC) A/B, as
well as UL16-binding proteins (ULBP) 1–4 (9, 10). Other natural
killer receptors (NKR) including the inhibitory receptor NKG2A
(CD159a), which binds to classic MHC class I molecules, can also
modulate the reactivity pattern of γδ T cells (11–13). Furthermore,
the CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1)-CD54 [intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1)] interaction and Toll-like receptors (TLR) also modulate
γδ T-cell effector function (14–16).
Pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR, have been identified
as primary sensors of bacterial and viral components. The cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) domain of the TLRs is
required for intracellular signaling, leading to the production of
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, type I IFNs, and upregulation of costimulatory molecules (17). TLR agonists are suggested as immunoresponse enhancers with the potential to
overcome the tolerance to tumor antigens, the decreased expression of costimulatory molecules on tumor cells, the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells, and the production of
antiproliferative cytokines produced in the tumor microenvironment (18). TLR agonists mediate their effect by enhancing CTL
activity or by triggering apoptosis in tumor cells. On the other
hand, TLR agonists can provide survival, proliferation, chemoresistance (e.g., upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, such as cFLIP
and XIAP), and invasiveness of tumor cells (19–21). Thus, the effects of TLR agonists on tumor cells need to be carefully examined
before their application in immunotherapy.
In this report, we focused on TLR3, which recognizes dsRNA or
surrogate ligand poly(I:C), and TLR7, which recognizes ssRNA or
surrogate ligand imiquimod (22, 23). We observed that the in vitro
stimulation of tumor cells with TLR3 and TLR7 agonists enhances
cytotoxicity of γδ T cells.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of T-cell lines and clones. Buffy coats from healthy
adult blood donors were obtained from the Department of Transfusion
Medicine in Kiel/Lübeck, Germany. Heparinized blood was obtained from
cancer patients suffering from pancreatic or ovarian cancer. Informed consent was obtained from all donors, and research was approved by relevant
institutional review boards. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). γδ T-cell
lines were established as previously described (8, 24). γδ T-cell clones were
established by limiting dilution and further expansion as described (25). In
addition, CD8+ αβ T cells were established from PBMC of cancer patients 1
and 2, both suffering from ovarian cell carcinoma. PBMCs were stimulated
with phytohemagglutinine to expand T cells. CD8+ T cells were purified by
magnetic depletion of non-CD8+ T cells and expanded by feeder cells and
phytohemagglutinine as described (8, 24).
Tumor cell lines. The following epithelial tumor cell lines were used:
pancreatic adenocarcinoma Pt45P1, Panc89, PancTu1, Colo357 (kindly

mous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) BHY and PCI-1 (kindly
provided by Prof. B. Wollenberg, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Lübeck), malignant melanoma MeWo [American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC)], primary cell line (lung-ca 459) established from the malignant
pleural effusion of a patient with a non–small cell lung carcinoma, and
two tumor cell lines established from ascites of patients with ovarian cell
carcinoma. All tumor cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS

supplemented with antibiotics, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 25 mmol/L
HEPES. Adherent tumor cells were trypsinized by treatment with 0.5% trypsin/0.2% EDTA for splitting and functional assays and by Accutase (PAA,
Cölbe, Germany) for staining.
Flow cytometry. The following monoclonal antibody (mAb) were used
as FITC or PE conjugates for cell surface staining: anti-CD3, anti-TCRγδ,
anti-TCRαβ, corresponding isotype controls (all from BD Biosciences),
anti-TCRVδ2 (Beckman Coulter), anti-TCRVγ9 (clone 7A5; ref. 26),
and anti-TCRVδ1 (Thermo Fisher). For intracellular staining, 3 to 5 × 105
cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit
(BD Biosciences), and stained with PE-conjugated anti-TLR3 mAb clone
TLR3.7 (e-Biosciences), unconjugated anti-TLR7 mAb clone 4F4 (Alexis)
or Alexa Fluor 647-labeled granzyme B mAb (BD Biosciences), or the appropriate isotype controls for 30 min. For detection of unconjugated TLR7, PElabeled goat F(ab')2 anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) was used as a second step
reagent.
To characterize NKRs and their corresponding ligands as well as adhesion molecules, we used the following mAb for tumor cells: FITC-labeled
HLA class I (W6/32; immunoglobulin purified from supernatants of hybridoma obtained from ATCC); PE-labeled anti-CD54 (from BD Biosciences).
All samples were measured on a FACS‐Calibur (BD Biosciences) using
the CellQuestPro software.
Cell culture and determination of cytokines and granzymes. To
investigate the effect of TLR ligands, a final concentration of 50 μg/mL
poly(I:C) (Calbiochem) and 5 μg/mL imiquimod (InvivoGen; both previously titrated) were added to the coculture of γδ T cells and tumor cells. Alternatively, tumor cells were pretreated for 20 h with poly(I:C) or
imiquimod. The cells were then washed, and cell number and viability were
determined. Supernatants of duplicate cultures were collected after 20 h
and stored at −20°C to determine cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, type I IFNs)
produced by tumor cells. IL-6 and TNF-α were measured by Immulite, an
automatic chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (DPC Biermann
GmbH), and type I IFN (IFNα/β) by human sandwich IFN-α and IFN-β
ELISA kit (41105 and 41410; PBL Biomedical Laboratories), all according
to the manufacturers' instructions. Human granzyme A and B produced
by γδ T cells in the coculture with tumor cells were measured by a sensitive
sandwich ELISA (BMS2026 and BMS2027), following the procedures outlined by the manufacturer (Bender MedSystems).
Cytotoxicity assay. Untreated or TLR ligand pretreated tumor cells
were labeled with 50 μCi sodium 51Cr and used as targets in a standard
of 4-h 51Cr release assay with titrated numbers of γδ T-effector cells. Supernatants were measured in a MicroBeta Trilux β-counter (Perkin- Elmer).
Specific lysis was calculated as ((cpmtest − cpmspontaneous) / (cpmmax −
cpmspontaneous)) × 100, where spontaneous release was determined in medium only and maximal release was determined in Triton-lysed target cells.
Spontaneous release did not exceed 15% of the maximal release. Where indicated, γδ effector T cells were preincubated for 30 to 60 min before the

fluorescence intensity was calculated as an x-fold increase in relation to the staining with immunoglobulin control as shown by the indicated numbers.

Results and Discussion
Differential response to BrHPP stimulation of γδ T cells
from the peripheral blood versus ascites from cancer
patients. There is substantial interest to explore γδ T cells for immunotherapy and also a partial success (2, 27–31). We examined

whether γδ T cells in the peripheral blood or in the ascites of cancer patients respond differentially to in vitro stimulation and which
population is better for large-scale expansion of γδ T cells. We
observed that the relative proportion of CD3+ γδ T cells within
the peripheral blood of healthy donors and cancer patients is higher
than in the ascites of the same cancer patients (Fig. 1A). The
majority of the γδ T cells were Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells (data not shown).
In contrast, the relative proportion of CD3+TCRαβ+ T cells was
slightly higher in the ascites of cancer patients compared with
the peripheral blood (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we recognized that

breast cancer were unable to proliferate in response to BrHPP even
in the presence of IL-2 (Fig. 1B) and even after depletion of CD4+
CD25+ regulatory T cells (data not shown), whereas γδ T cells
from peripheral blood of the same cancer patients proliferated
(Fig. 1B). We and others could correlate the nonresponsiveness
of the γδ T cells in the ascites with high amounts of soluble
MICA in the ascites inhibiting the binding of membrane bound
MICA and thus an internalization of NKG2D, which is important
for activation of the NKG2D/NKG2D ligand pathway (32). Furthermore, immunosuppressive cytokines in the microenvironment of the tumor, including transforming growth factor-β and
IL-10, chemotherapy as well as apoptose-sensitivity of γδ T cells
could be responsible for the nonresponsiveness of γδ T cells from
the tumor side.4
Therefore, we established γδ T-cell lines and clones from the
peripheral blood of healthy donors and cancer patients to investigate whether the addition of TLR agonists enhances the cytotoxicity of γδ T cells toward tumor cells.

atic adenocarcinomas, SCCHN, ovarian carcinomas, melanoma)
for TLR3 and TLR7 expression by flow cytometry. As can be seen
in Fig. 2A, all tested carcinomas (Pt45P1, Panc89, PancTu1,
Colo357, lung-ca 459, PCI-1, BHY) expressed TLR3 intracellularly,
except of the melanoma MeWo. The SCCHN tumor cell BHY expressed TLR3 intracellularly with the highest intensity as already
described (33). As expected, TLR3 was not expressed on the cell
surface (data not shown). All cell lines expressed TLR7 intracellularly with comparable intensity (Fig. 1B). The staining of the two
ovarian carcinomas was not possible due to the spontaneous cell
death of these tumor cells occurring during staining procedure.
Cytotoxicity assays with tumor target cells cocultured with γδ
T-effector cells showed that the direct addition of TLR3 ligand
poly(I:C) or TLR7 ligand imiquimod did not enhance the cytotoxic
activity of γδ T cells from healthy donors (HD1–HD4) or cancer
patients (CP1–CP2). These results were repeated in two to four independent experiments with the indicated γδ T-cell lines or clones
cocultured with pancreatic adenocarcinoma Pt45P1 as shown
in Fig. 3A. The data suggest that the 4-hour period of 51Cr release
assay is too short to trigger effects of TLR ligands on tumor cells or
γδ T cells (Fig. 3A). Therefore, Pt45P1 was pretreated for 20 hours
with either poly(I:C) or imiquimod followed by two washing steps, resulting in increased sensitivity to γδ T-cell killing (Fig. 3B). Moreover,
an additional stimulation of γδ T cells with the phosphoantigen

BrHPP further increased cytotoxicity toward pretreated Pt45P1
(Fig. 3C). In comparison to γδ T cells, CD8+ TCRαβ T cells from
the same donors did not lyse the tested tumor cells, independently
of preincubation with medium or TLR ligands (data not shown).
Furthermore, similar patterns were observed with the indicated
γδ T-cell lines or clones when other pancreatic adenocarcinomas
(Panc89, PancTu1, Colo357), SCCHN (PCI-1, BHY), or lung carcinoma (lung-ca459) instead of Pt45P1 were used (Fig. 4A–F). Pretreatment of Panc89, PancTu1, Colo357, lung-ca459, PCI-1, and BHY
with poly(I:C) or imiquimod increased the sensitivity to BrHPP-activated γδ T-cell killing (Fig. 4A–F). Interestingly, we observed a
high increase in γδ T-cell cytotoxicity, when the tumor cell line
with the highest TLR3 expression (BHY) was preincubated with
poly(I:C) (Fig. 4F). However, pretreatment of Colo357 with imiquimod did not enhance γδ T-cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 4C). In contrast,
melanoma MeWo proved to be resistant to the treatment with poly
(I:C) or imiquimod in repetitive experiments (Fig. 4G). The lack of
TLR3 in MeWo could explain the resistance to the increased lysis
after poly(I:C) pretreatment. However, imiquimod pretreatment
did not enhance the susceptibility of TLR7-expressing MeWo, suggesting that other or additional mechanisms were involved in the
enhanced tumor cell lysis mediated by TLR ligand pretreatment
(see below). To show that MeWo is principally susceptible to γδ
T-cell killing, we pretreated MeWo with the aminobisphosphonates alendronate (Fig. 4H). Aminobisphosphonates induce an
accumulation of isopententyl pyrophosphate and an upregulation
of NKGD2 ligands, such as ULBP2 and ULBP3 (ref. 34; data not
shown), which results in an increased γδ T-cell effector function.
In accordance with the enhancement of tumor cell lysis, we
measured an increased production of granzymes A and B, when
poly(I:C)- or imiquimod-treated tumor cells were cocultured with
γδ T-cell lines, and a significantly increased accumulation of intracellular granzyme B in γδ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Differential effects of poly(I:C) versus imiquimod on tumor
cells. Based on these findings, we were interested in the potential
mechanism of enhanced γδ T-cell cytotoxicity after TLR ligand
pretreatment of tumor cells. Therefore, we examined whether
poly(I:C) and imiquimod influence (a) tumor cell survival or apoptosis, (b) production of proinflammatory cytokines, and (c) modulation of costimulatory molecules.
(a) Others have recently reported that TLR3 or TLR7 agonists
trigger apoptosis resulting in a direct cytostatic and cytotoxic
effect in several breast, skin, or bladder cancer cell lines in
malignant melanoma and in basal cell carcinoma patients
(35–38). Poly(I:C)-induced cell death involves the Toll/IL-1R
domain–containing adaptor–dependent production of IFN-β
as well as the activation of NF-κB p65 and extrinsic caspases,
which all seem to be required for apoptosis (35, 39). Similarly,
imiquimod is described to induce caspase-dependent cell
death via the adaptor molecule MyD88 and activation of
transcription factor NF-κB. However, we excluded a direct
poly(I:C)- or imiquimod-induced cell death in tested tumor
cell lines, except for Colo357, of flow cytometric Annexin/
propidium iodide staining (data not shown). The pretreatment
of Colo357 for 20 hours with TLR3 or TLR7 ligands induced
enhanced cell death (70%). However, for the 51Cr assay, viable
Colo357 cells were counted and no further cell death was
observed during the 4-hour period of the 51Cr assay. In accordance with the failure of TLR ligands to trigger apoptosis in the
majority of the tested tumor cell lines, we were unable to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (22). November 15, 2009

detect type I IFN in the supernatant of tumor cells by ELISA
after TLR ligand stimulation (data not shown).
(b) On the other hand, we measured high levels of IL-6 produced
by Pt45P1 and BHY after poly(I:C) but not after imiquimod
treatment (Fig. 5A) and slightly enhanced concentrations of
TNF-α after poly(I:C) treatment of Pt45P1 and BHY or imiquimod treatment of Pt45P1 (Fig. 5B). An enhanced proliferation
or survival of some tumor cells mediated by an increased
autocrine IL-6 production after stimulation with TLR7/8 agonist, a polarization of immune cells toward tumor supporting
cells by cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, and MIF, and an
induction of regulators of cell survival such as XIAP and
phospho-AKT by TLR ligands have been reported by others
(40–42). Interestingly, we observed a weak reduction of
enhanced spontaneous cell death in SCCHN after pretreatment with poly(I:C) in the absence of γδ T cells (data not
shown). However, poly(I:C) treatment of SCCHN cocultured
with γδ T cells resulted in enhanced killing instead of survival
(as shown in Fig. 4E, F). One explanation for the enhanced
killing by γδ T cells could be the low level of IL-6 possibly secreted during the 4 hours of 51Cr release assay. Tumor cells
treated for 20 hours with poly(I:C) produced high amounts
of IL-6 (Fig. 5A, B), which was washed out when the tumor
cells were prepared for the 51Cr release assay. To examine
the effects of IL-6, we added recombinant IL-6 to the coculture
of γδ T cells and tumor cells during the 4 hours of 51Cr release
assay. The addition of recombinant IL-6 did not enhance the
γδ T cell–mediated killing of the tumor cells, whereas lysis

experiments (SD < 10%). The usage of other γδ T cells generated from other
donors (HD2, HD3; CP1, CP2) delivered similar results.

Enhanced Antitumor Responses of γδ T Cells by TLR Agonists

could be increased in the presence of recombinant type I IFNs
(IFNα/β, mainly produced by dendritic cells; Fig. 5C). Moreover, the nonresponsiveness of γδ T cells to IL-6 is well in line
with the failure of the tested γδ T-cell lines to express IL-6R
(data not shown).
(c) Furthermore, we examined whether costimulatory molecules
were upregulated after TLR ligand stimulation. However, none
of the tumor cells expressed CD80/CD86 and CD40 ligand, except Panc89, which slightly expressed CD40 ligand (data not
shown). Moreover, we did not observe an upregulation of costimulatory molecules after pretreatment of tumor cells with
poly(I:C) or imiquimod (data not shown).

We and others reported that the NKG2D/NKG2D ligand pathway also has a costimulatory effect on γδ T cells, thereby regulating activation and cytolytic effector function (7, 8). Therefore, we
examined the effect of TLR ligands on NKRs in the coculture of γδ
T cells and tumor cells. As expected, most of the Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T-cell
lines of healthy donors as well as of cancer patients expressed the
activating NKG2D receptor on the cell surface, whereas the inhibitory NKG2A receptor was differentially expressed (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Other activating receptors, such as NKG2C, NKp30,

NKp46, KIR2DS1, and KIR2DS2, were not expressed (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). The inhibitory receptors KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2 were also
not detectable, and the inhibitory KIR3DL1 was barely expressed
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Therefore, we concentrated on a possible
modulation of NKG2D and NKG2A or their ligands. All tested tumor
cell lines expressed the NKGD2 ligands MICA/B and ULBP 2-3
(except for MeWo) and the NKG2A ligands MHC-class I molecules
(data not shown).
We observed that the NKG2D expression on γδ T cells decreased already at 4 hours after TCR stimulation (BrHPP) in the
presence of tumor cells but did not further decrease by coculturing
γδ T cells with poly(I:C)- or imiquimod-treated tumor cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). NKG2A expression was also not modulated in the presence of poly(I:C)- or imiquimod-treated tumor
cells (data not shown). Additionally, NKG2D ligand expression on
tumor cells was unaffected by pretreatment of tumor cells with
TLR ligands (data not shown), suggesting that the NKG2D/NKG2D
ligand pathway was not involved in the enhancement of γδ T-cell
cytotoxicity after pretreatment of tumor cells with poly(I:C) or imiquimod. This was confirmed by the usage of anti-NKG2D mAb
M585. γδ T-cell cytotoxicity was decreased after the addition of

anti-NKG2D mAb M585 to the coculture of γδ T cells and tumor
cells. However, the pretreatment of Pt45P1 with poly(I:C) or imiquimod in the presence of anti-NKG2D mAb M585 could not completely inhibit the γδ T cell–mediated lysis. Pretreatment of Pt45P1
with TLR ligands reduced γδ T-cell cytotoxicity only to the level of
γδ T-cell lysis in the presence of untreated tumor cells without
anti-NKG2D mAb M585 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Interestingly, pretreatment of tumor cells with imiquimod significantly downregulated MHC class I molecules on tumor cells, which
are sensitive to enhanced γδ T-cell killing (Fig. 6A). The data suggest a reduced binding affinity to inhibitory receptor NKG2A and
thus an enhancement of tumor cell lysis. In contrast, pretreatment
of Colo357 with imiquimod did not downregulate MHC class I molecules on these cells, which correlated with the failure to enhance
γδ T cell–mediated lysis after pretreatment with imiquimod. In
contrast, MHC class I molecules were downregulated by imiquimod
on MeWo. However, the failure of imiquimod to enhance lysis of
MeWo by γδ T cells could be explained by the lack of NKG2D ligands on MeWo, which are usually required for tumor cell lysis (8).
In contrast, poly(I:C) pretreatment of tumor cells did not downregulate MHC class I molecules (Fig. 6A). Therefore, we also investigated a possible modulation of adhesion molecules, which also
play an important role in the interaction between cytotoxic γδ T
cells and tumor cells. Antibody blockade with anti-CD54 or antiCD18 has been reported to block γδ T cell–mediated killing of tumor cells (14). In accordance with these data (14), we observed
that a failure of CD54 expression, together with a lack of NKG2D
ligand expression on MeWo, could explain the reduced capacity of
γδ T cells to lyse MeWo cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of tumor
cells with poly(I:C) but not with imiquimod for 20 hours enhanced
the CD54 expression on these cells (Fig. 6B), which nicely correlated with an increased lysis of poly(I:C)-treated tumor cells (Figs. 3B,
C and 4A–F). A kinetic analysis over 24 hours with tumor cells cocultured with γδ T cells in the absence or presence of TLR ligands
clearly showed that MHC class I molecules were not downregulated and CD54 was not upregulated after 4 hours with imiquimodor poly(I:C)-treated tumor cells, respectively (data not shown).
These results could explain that the direct addition of TLR3 and
TLR7 ligands for 4 hours in the 51Cr release assay did not enhance
γδ T-cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we observed that poly(I:C)
treatment enhanced TNF-α production (Fig. 5B), which is
reported to enhance CD54 expression (14). Furthermore, the
enhancement of γδ T-cell cytotoxicity toward poly(I:C)-treated
tumor cells (Figs. 3 and 4) correlated with the intensity of
CD11a/CD18 expression on γδ T cells (Fig. 6C). Our data suggest
that different mechanisms are involved in the modulation of
tumor cell lysis by TLR3 versus TLR7 ligand.

In summary, pretreatment of tumor cells with TLR ligands resulted in an increased production of granzymes A and B, as well
as in an enhanced killing capacity of γδ T-cell lines/clones. The
treatment of tumor cells with poly(I:C) upregulated CD54, and
imiquimod downregulated MHC class I molecules. To date, imiquimod is used as first line topical therapy for, e.g., genital condyloma,
actinic keratosis, and basal cell carcinomas (43). Our data raise a
note of caution with regard to a possible in vivo application of poly
(I:C) or imiquimod (except for topical application) due to (a) additional side effects described by others (44) including poly(I:C)induced shock, renal failure, and hypersensitivity reactions; (b)
enhanced survival in the majority of the tested tumor cells (except
of Colo357); (c) no enhancing effect on costimulatory molecules;
and (d) insufficient examination of effects on other TLR3- or
TLR7-expressing cells of the innate and adaptive immune system.
In context of (d), we observed in preliminary experiments that the
cytotoxicity of γδ T cells from healthy donors or cancer patients
could also be enhanced by the pretreatment of the expanded γδ T
cells with poly(I:C) or imiquimod in combination with TCR stimulation.5 The preliminary data suggest that pretreatment of expanded γδ T cells with TLR ligands followed by several washing
steps (to eliminate TLR agonists) could be useful in the optimization of protocols for adoptive transfer. Pretreatment of γδ T cells
seems to be more expedient than in vivo application of TLR ligands
with unknown effects on diverse cell populations. Moreover, in ongoing experiments, we test whether poly(I:C(12)U) (Ampligen), a
GMP grade synthetic analogue of poly(I:C), which is suggested as
an adjuvant for immunotherapy of cancer, also enhances the cytolytic effector function of γδ T cells (44).
