A New Paradigm for Aptamer Therapeutic AS1411 Action:
Uptake by Macropinocytosis and Its Stimulation by a
Nucleolin-Dependent Mechanism
E. Merit Reyes-Reyes1, Yun Teng1, and Paula J. Bates1,2

Abstract
AS1411 is a first-in-class anticancer agent, currently in phase II clinical trials. It is a quadruplex-forming
oligodeoxynucleotide that binds to nucleolin as an aptamer, but its mechanism of action is not completely
understood. Mechanistic insights could lead to clinically useful markers for AS1411 response and to novel
targeted therapies. Previously, we proposed a model where cell surface nucleolin serves as the receptor for
AS1411, leading to selective uptake in cancer cells. Here, we compare uptake of fluorophore-labeled AS1411
(FL-AS1411) in DU145 prostate cancer cells (sensitive to AS1411) and Hs27 nonmalignant skin fibroblasts
(resistant to AS1411). Uptake of FL-AS1411 occurred by endocytosis in both cell types and was much more
efficient than an inactive, nonquadruplex oligonucleotide. Unexpectedly, uptake of FL-AS1411 was lower in
cancer cells compared with Hs27 cells. However, the mechanism of uptake was different, occurring by macropinocytosis in cancer cells, but by a nonmacropinocytic pathway in Hs27 cells. Additionally, treatment of
various cancer cells with AS1411 caused hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis, provoking an increase in its
own uptake, whereas no stimulation was observed for nonmalignant cells. Nucleolin was not required for
initial FL-AS1411 uptake in DU145 cells but was necessary for induced macropinocytosis and FL-AS1411
uptake at later times. Our results are inconsistent with the previous mechanistic model but confirm that
nucleolin plays a role in mediating AS1411 effects. The data suggest a new model for AS1411 action as well
as a new role for nucleolin in stimulating macropinocytosis, a process with potential applications in drug
delivery. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8617–29. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
AS1411 is a 26-base guanine-rich oligonucleotide (GRO)
with an unmodified (phosphodiester) DNA backbone. This
molecule and its related analogues can inhibit proliferation
and induce cell death in many types of cancer cells but have
little effect on normal cells (1–4). Biological effects of this
class of molecules in cancer cells include cell cycle arrest, inhibition of NF-κB signaling, induction of tumor suppressor
gene expression, and reduction of bcl-2 expression (3–6). A
phase I clinical trial of AS1411 (formerly known as AGRO100)
in patients with metastatic cancer has indicated no serious
adverse effects with promising clinical activity, and AS1411 is
now being tested in phase II trials (2).

Our previous work has revealed that antiproliferative
GROs such as AS1411 can form stable guanine quadruplex
structures, which imparts an unusual resistance to cellular
and serum nucleases. We have also shown that GROs bind
directly and selectively to nucleolin and that the growth inhibitory activity of GROs is positively correlated with their
ability to bind this protein (1, 7, 8). In addition, several biological effects of AS1411 have been shown to result from its
ability to alter the subcellular localization of certain nucleolin-containing complexes or to interfere with the molecular
interactions of nucleolin (3, 5, 6). Therefore, we have concluded that AS1411 acts as an aptamer to nucleolin.
Despite its molecular target having been identified, the
mechanism of action for AS1411 and the reasons for its
marked tumor selectivity have not yet been fully elucidated.
Nucleolin is a multifunctional protein present in the nucleolus and nucleus of most cells, as well as in the cytoplasm
and on the surface for some cells, including cancer cells
and angiogenic endothelial cells (2, 9, 10). This protein
has been reported to control a wide range of fundamental
cellular processes (11), as well as having important roles in
malignant transformation and cancer progression (12).
Based on the knowledge that cell surface nucleolin mediates the endocytosis of a wide range of ligands, we had
originally speculated that nucleolin could act as a receptor
for AS1411 and that, due to the elevated expression of

nucleolin by cancer cells, uptake of AS1411 would occur in
a tumor-selective manner (13).
In this study, we evaluated uptake of fluorescently labeled
AS1411 in several cell types and compared the mechanism of
uptake between DU145 prostate cancer cells, which are sensitive to AS1411, and Hs27 nonmalignant skin fibroblasts,
which are resistant to AS1411. We now describe the results
of this research, including our unexpected findings with regard to the uptake of AS1411 and the role of nucleolin in its
mechanism of action.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen.
Sequences used for this study were AS1411, 5′-d(GGTGGT‐
GGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTGG) and fluorophore-labeled
AS1411 (FL-AS1411); 5′-fluor-d(TTTGGTGGTGGTGGTTG‐
TGGTGGTGGTGG) [wherein fluor is either 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM; used for flow cytometry) or Alexa Fluor 488 (used
for confocal microscopy]; tAS1411, 5′-d(TTTGGTGGTGGTGG‐
TTGTGGTGGTGGTGG); FL-CRO, 5′-fluor-d(TTTCCTCCTCC‐
TCCTTCTCCTCCTCCTCC); CRO, 5′-d(CCTCCTCCTCCTT‐
CTCCTCCTCCTCC); and tCRO, 5′-d(TTTCCTCCTCCTC‐
CTTCTCCTCCTCCTCC). Unmodified oligonucleotides were
purchased in the desalted form, whereas fluorescently labeled
sequences were high-performance liquid chromatography purified. The 29-mer sequences were used for some experiments
because quenching of the fluorophore occurred when it was
located adjacent at the 5′ terminal base of AS1411,3 so a spacer consisting of three thymidines was added. We confirmed
that the antiproliferative activities of 29-mer sequences, with
and without the fluorophore, were comparable with the synthesized 26-mer AS1411 sequence and with AS1411 obtained
from Antisoma (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The dextran (10,000
molecular weight) anionic fixable (dextran-10K) and transferrin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 were
purchased from Invitrogen. Antirabbit and antimouse antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase and anti-histone 3
rabbit polyclonal and anti-pan cadherin (C19) goat polyclonal
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotech. Anti-nucleolin
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were from Stressgen (4E2) and
Santa Cruz (MS-3). The anti-nucleolin mAb (D3) was a generous gift from Dr. Jau-Shyong Deng, University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine. Cytochalasin D, dynasore, and amiloride
were from Calbiochem. Triton X-100 was from Sigma, paraformaldehyde was from Electron Microscopy Sciences, and
DMSO was from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
Cell culture and treatment
All cells were obtained from ATCC and routinely grown in
a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Hs27 (nonmalignant human foreskin fibroblasts), DU145 (hormone
refractory prostate cancer), HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma),
MCF-7 (hormone-dependent breast cancer), and MDA-MB-

231 (hormone-independent breast cancer) cells were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life
Technologies), 62.5 μg/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Hyclone Laboratories). MCF-10A cells (immortalized
human breast epithelial cells) were grown in MEBM supplemented with all the components of MEGM bullet kit (Lonza)
except for GA-1000. We did not carry out additional testing to
authenticate cell lines, but their morphology and behavior
were consistent with ATCC descriptions. Cells were plated
at 50% confluence and incubated for 18 hours to allow adherence, and then the medium was changed for fresh supplemented medium and treated by addition of oligodeoxynucleotides
directly to the culture medium to give the final concentration
indicated in the figure legends. Dynasore and cytochalasin D
were dissolved in DMSO. Amiloride was dissolved in serumfree medium. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors in serumfree medium for either 30 minutes (cytochalasin D, dynasore)
or 60 minutes (amiloride). Cells for biochemical analyses were
lysed in lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 50
mmol/L Tris-HCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% IGEPAL CA630 (pH 7.5)] containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails (Calbiochem) for 20 minutes at 4°C and then cleared
by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C. All protein
concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid
assay (Pierce).
Flow cytometric assays
Cells (2 × 105) in fresh complete medium were plated into
six-well plates for 18 hours. After complete adhesion, cells were
incubated as indicated in the figures or legends. Cells were
washed once with ice-cold PBS, incubated with 1 μg/mL
7-amino-actinomycin D or 1 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) for
5 minutes on ice to allow exclusion of nonviable cells, and
washed twice with ice-cold PBS. To harvest, cells were treated
with 0.01% trypsin/0.5 mmol/L EDTA (300 μL) for 3 minutes
prior to the addition of 3 mL supplemented culture medium.
Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 mL of 1%
paraformaldehyde for analysis by flow cytometry using a
FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells (4 × 104) in fresh complete culture medium were plated
on 18-mm diameter glass coverslips for 18 hours. The medium
was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were treated
as described in the figure legends. After incubation, cells were
washed three times with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature, and
washed three times with PBS. After washing, the coverslips
were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's directions.
Immunofluorescence was documented with an LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped
with an Omnichrome argon-krypton laser. Images were obtained
with a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63X oil immersion objective (1.4 NA).
Biotinylation and purification of cell surface proteins
Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and a
freshly prepared solution of a cell-impermeable biotinylating

agent (sulfo-NHS-biotin, Pierce) was added (0.5 mg/mL in
PBS). After 30 minutes of incubation at 4°C, cells were
washed once with ice-cold TBS [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150
mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.5)], incubated with ice-cold complete
medium for 10 minutes at 4°C, and then washed twice with
TBS. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated by incubating
with high-capacity NeutrAvidin agarose (Pierce) for 2 hours
at 4°C with gentle agitation and then washed with ice-cold
lysis buffer.
RNA interference
Nucleolin small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes
corresponding to the sequences 5′-GGUCGUCAUACCUCAGAAGtt (NCL1), 5′-GGCAAAGCAUUGGUAGCAAtt (NCL2),
and 5′-CGGUGAAAUUGAUGGAAAUtt (NCL3) were chemically synthesized and annealed by Ambion, Inc. BLAST
analysis showed no homology of the siRNA sequences to
any other sequence in the Human Genome Database.
The siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions.
The scrambled siRNA used as a negative control was from
Ambion.
Immunoblotting
Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-Tris PAGE and then
electrotransferred onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes
(Millipore) in Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol.
Proteins were detected by immunoblotting as described
(14). In some cases, membranes were stripped of bound antibodies using 62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mmol/L
2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 minutes at 60°C and
then reprobed as described in figure legends.
Densitometry and statistical analysis
Densitometry was used to measure band intensities by
scanning autoradiographic films and using UN-SCAN-IT gel
software (Silk Scientific Corporation). Band intensities were
normalized as indicated in the figure legends. The statistical
comparisons between AS1411-treated and control groups
were performed using Student's t test.

Results
Uptake of FL-AS1411 occurs through an active
uptake process
To first identify suitable conditions for our study, we analyzed the timing and serum dependence of uptake in DU145
prostate cancer cells, which are sensitive to AS1411. Using flow
cytometry with gating to exclude nonviable cells, we compared uptake of FL-AS1411, a fluorescently labeled version of
the active aptamer, with that of FL-CRO, a fluorescently
labeled control oligonucleotide with no antiproliferative
activity. It has not been possible to identify a scrambled or
point-mutated analogue of AS1411 that lacks activity because
of the very high proportion of guanines in the sequence.
Therefore, a sequence where the guanines are substitututed
with cytosines (FL-CRO) is used simply as a control phosphodiester oligodeoxyonucleotide of the same length. We first

www.aacrjournals.org

confirmed that the fluorophore signal was from internalized,
rather than surface-bound, material by showing that cellassociated fluorescence was not influenced by washing the
cells with dextran sulfate to remove the extracellular oligonucleotide or by adding trypan blue to quench external fluorescent signals before flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
FL-AS1411 uptake was detected as early as 5 minutes, with
maximum signal between 2 and 4 hours under these conditions (Fig. 1A). FL-CRO uptake was consistently much lower
than FL-AS1411 and followed different kinetics. These data
are in accord with our recent finding that guanine-rich
phosphodiester sequences, such as AS1411, are taken up
more efficiently than other non–guanine-rich sequences
(15). As shown in Fig. 1B, uptake of FL-AS1411 was independent of the presence of serum in the medium.
To determine whether AS1411 uptake occurs through an active uptake process, we evaluated the temperature dependence of AS1411 uptake in various cancer cell types and
nonmalignant Hs27 skin fibroblasts. In all cell types examined,
the uptake of FL-AS1411 and FL-CRO showed strong temperature dependence. However, in contrast to our original hypothesis, Hs27 cells seemed to have a higher uptake of
AS1411 than any of the cancer cells analyzed (Fig. 1C). The
dose-response curve for FL-AS1411 uptake in DU145 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) suggested at least two components:
uptake involving a high-affinity, low-capacity receptor, which
was saturated at high nanomolar concentrations, and a nonsaturable uptake that was predominant at micromolar concentrations (the curve presented an almost linear increase
between 1.25 and 40 μmol/L). Concentrations higher than 40
μmol/L resulted in obvious cytotoxicity, even at this early time
point. We believe that the nonsaturable uptake component is
most relevant for AS1411 activity, because this corresponds to
concentrations at which the biological effects are observed in
cultured cancer cells and to the serum concentrations in
patients treated with AS1411.
FL-AS1411 uptake occurs through different endocytic
mechanisms in cancer cells and in nonmalignant cells
To confirm that uptake of AS1411 occurs by endocytosis,
we tested for involvement of the actin cytoskeleton, which
has been implicated in regulating endocytic pathways. To
this end, DU145 and Hs27 were pretreated with an actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, and assessed for FLAS1411 uptake by flow cytometry. Cytocholasin D–treated
cells showed a decrease in FL-AS1411 uptake compared with
the untreated cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with endocytic uptake. Recognized pathways of endocytosis include classic
clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis,
and macropinocytosis (16). The GTPase dynamin is required
for clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and some
clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathways (16), so we
next investigated the effect of dynasore, a potent inhibitor
of dynamin function (17), on FL-AS1411 uptake in DU145
cancer cells and nonmalignant Hs27 cells (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of Hs27 cells with dynasore decreased their uptake of
AS1411 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, pretreatment of DU145 cells

Figure 1. AS1411 cell internalization is an active process. Cells were treated as described below and analyzed by flow cytometry. A, DU145 cells were
incubated at 37°C with complete medium containing 10 μmol/L FL-AS1411 (black line) or 10 μmol/L FL-CRO (gray line) for the time indicated.
B, DU145 cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in complete or serum-free medium containing 10 μmol/L FL-AS1411, 10 μmol/L FL-CRO, or no
oligonucleotide. C, various cell lines were incubated with 10 μmol/L FL-AS1411 (black outline), 10 μmol/L FL-CRO (gray outline), or without DNA (solid gray)
at 37°C or 4°C for 2 hours. Mean fluorescent intensities at 37°C were as follows: DU145, 10.8; HeLa, 10.7; MDA-MB-231, 11.9; Hs27, 35.2. All
experiments were repeated at least three times. Data are mean of three independent samples; bars, SEM.

slightly increased their uptake of FL-AS1411. To rule out the
possibility that DU145 cells were unresponsive to dynasore,
we showed that uptake of transferrin, a well-established
ligand of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, was inhibited
in DU145 cells pretreated with dynasore (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). These results indicate that AS1411 may be taken
up by a predominantly clathrin- or caveolae-dependent route
of entry in Hs27 cells, but not in DU145 cells.
Macropinocytosis is the predominant mechanism of
uptake for AS1411 in cancer cells
Recent work has shown that internalization of DNA can
be mediated through macropinocytosis (18–20), an actindriven, ligand-independent mechanism in which cells “gulp”
the surrounding medium and any macromolecules it contains. This endocytic mechanism has been shown to be sen-

sitive to amiloride, a specific inhibitor of Na+/H exchange
(21), so we tested the effect of amiloride on FL-AS1411 uptake. We found that amiloride pretreatment caused a reduction in FL-AS1411 uptake in DU145 cancer cells but a slight
increase in the nonmalignant Hs27 cells (Fig. 2C). There was
little effect of amiloride treatment on uptake of FL-CRO in
either DU145 or Hs27 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Amiloride treatment also decreased AS1411 uptake in other cancer
cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, data not shown). These data
imply that macropinocytosis is responsible for the internalization of AS1411 in cancer cells.
To confirm these results without using chemical inhibitors, uptake was also examined by confocal microscopy. This
showed that FL-AS1411 was localized in confined structures
in the cytoplasm of both cancer and nonmalignant cells
(Fig. 3A). As expected, uptake of FL-CRO was much lower

than FL-AS1411 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, our studies showed
that macropinocytosis (indicated by dextran uptake) is much
more active in DU145 cancer cells than in the nonmalignant
Hs27 cells (Fig. 3). Moreover, internalized FL-AS1411 was
strongly colocalized with the macropinocytic marker dextran
in DU145 cells (Fig. 3A), but not in Hs27 cells (Fig. 3A).
Further experiments were performed to confirm the identity
of the vesicles containing FL-AS1411 as macropinosomes,
which can be distinguished from other endosomes by their
comparative inability to concentrate receptors (22). Therefore,
we compared localization of transferrin, a ligand for the transferrin receptor, with that of dextran or FL-AS1411. We observed
that transferrin and dextran were localized mainly in distinct
nonoverlapping vesicles in DU145 and Hs27 cells (Fig. 3C) and
that there was very little overlap between transferrin and
AS1411 in DU145 cells (Fig. 3D). These combined data confirm
that the endocytic process regulating the internalization of
AS1411 in DU145 cancer cells is macropinocytosis.

It is also notable that no FL-AS1411 was observed in the
nuclear region in these studies. This was in contrast to our
earlier (unpublished) studies using fluorescence microscopy,
where we had observed some cells with intense nuclear fluorescence after 24 hours or more treatment with 10 μmol/L
FAM-labeled AS1411. This pattern was observed in cancer
cell lines, but not in the nonresponsive Hs27 cells. We initially interpreted this result as preferential uptake in cancer
cells, but later realized that the cells with strong nuclear
staining were likely dying in response to AS1411 and were
therefore permeable, whereas the lack of intense nuclear
staining in Hs27 cells reflected that they did not die in
response to AS1411. The current confocal microscopy and
flow cytometry studies (which are gated to exclude dead
or dying cells that are PI positive due to loss of plasma
membrane integrity) show that overall uptake is not cancer
specific and that AS1411 has a nonnuclear localization in
viable cells.

Role of Macropinocytosis in AS1411 Uptake and Mechanism

AS1411 stimulates macropinocytosis in cancer cells
Several molecules that are internalized by macropinocytosis, including some cell penetrating peptides and viruses, are
known to stimulate macropinocytosis and thereby enhance
their own uptake (23–25). Moreover, several research groups
have recently shown that hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis can cause a novel form of cell death, characterized by
vacuolization, irregular nuclei, and swollen cells (26–29), and
AS1411 causes changes in cancer cell morphology with exactly these features (4). Therefore, we investigated whether
AS1411 could stimulate macropinocytosis in DU145 cells or
nonmalignant Hs27 cells. Flow cytometry experiments indicated a significant increase in the uptake of the macropinocytic marker dextran in DU145 cells treated with tAS1411
(which is FL-AS1411 without the fluorescent label) for 24,
48, or 72 hours, whereas there was no increase in the Hs27
cells (Fig. 4A). As in all our flow cytometry experiments, cells
were gated to exclude permeable cells, discounting the possibility that this increase was due to cell death. No changes in
dextran uptake were observed in DU145 cells treated with
the control oligonucleotide tCRO (Fig. 4A) or with AS1411
for shorter times (1, 2, and 4 hours, data not shown). The
tAS1411 was also able to induce hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis in other cancer cells lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB231) and had a reduced effect in another nonmalignant cell
type (MCF-10A; Fig. 4B), suggesting that these novel observations may represent a general difference between the response of cancer cells and normal cells, although further
studies are needed to verify this idea. Confocal microscopy
confirmed that DU145 cells treated with tAS1411 presented
a higher dextran uptake compared with untreated or CROtreated cells (Fig. 4C). Additional experiments (Supplementary Fig. S4) confirmed that the 26-mer version of AS1411 was
able to induce the same response as tAS1411 (which has
three additional nucleotides for reasons described in Materials and Methods).
This result also implies that AS1411 might actually promote its own internalization by cancer cells. To test this idea,
we pretreated DU145 cells for 24 hours with or without
tAS1411, then added FL-AS1411, and evaluated uptake after
an additional 2 hours using flow cytometry. As predicted,
DU145 cells pretreated with tAS1411, but not those that received control pretreatment, showed an increase in the uptake of FL-AS1411 in DU145 cells, whereas there was no
comparable increase in AS1411-treated Hs27 cells (Fig. 4D).
All of these results indicate that initial AS1411 uptake leads
to the stimulation of macropinocytosis, inducing an increase
of its own uptake. This idea is not necessarily inconsistent
with the time course data (Fig. 1A), because the measured
fluorescence signal may decrease over time for a number
of reasons, including exocytosis of the ligand or fluorescence
quenching due to environmental factors such as protein
binding or pH.
Having shown that AS1411-induced macropinocytosis
could lead to enhanced uptake of a nucleic acid (AS1411)
and a polysaccharide (dextran), we also evaluated uptake of a
protein, namely, fluorescently labeled transferrin. We observed
that pretreatment with AS1411 led to increased uptake of

transferrin in DU145 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Although
uptake of transferrin in untreated cells occurs by dynamindependent receptor-mediated endocytosis (Supplementary
Figs. S3 and S5), the additional uptake induced by AS1411
was apparently due to macropinocytosis, because it was completely inhibited by amiloride (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Initial uptake of AS1411 is independent of nucleolin
We have shown that nucleolin is the primary molecular
target of AS1411 and had previously hypothesized that surface nucleolin may serve as a receptor for AS1411 (2, 13).
However, the new data are not consistent with that hypothesis, because they indicate that uptake occurs not by classic
receptor-mediated endocytosis but by macropinocytosis.
Therefore, we were curious to learn whether nucleolin played
a role in AS1411 uptake. We first assessed the effect of an
anti-nucleolin mAb (D3, which we confirmed could bind to
surface nucleolin) on uptake of FL-AS1411 in DU145 cells after 2 hours of incubation and found no effect (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Next, we carried out similar experiments using
siRNAs to knock down expression of nucleolin. Immunoblot
analyses confirmed that expression of total nucleolin could
be reduced by >80% in cells transfected with nucleolin
siRNAs compared with control-transfected cells (Fig. 5A).
We also showed that these siRNAs could effectively knock
down the cell surface form of nucleolin (Fig. 5B), using techniques described in the Materials and Methods. We next
used the transfected DU145 cells to assess the uptake of
FL-AS1411 after 2 hours by flow cytometry analysis and
found that knockdown of nucleolin had no effect on FLAS1411 uptake under these conditions (Fig. 5C).
Nucleolin regulates AS1411-induced stimulation
of macropinocytosis
Our results (Fig. 4) suggest that induction of macropinocytosis may be an important component of AS1411 activity.
Therefore, we also determined whether nucleolin knockdown
affects the tAS1411-mediated stimulation of macropinocystosis in DU145 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, inhibition of nucleolin
expression by specific siRNAs had only a marginal effect
on the baseline macropinocytosis but caused a significant
decrease in AS1411-induced macropinocytosis, almost completely blocking this process. Accordingly, the tAS1411induced uptake of FL-AS1411 was also completely blocked
in DU145 cells transfected with nucleolin siRNAs (Fig. 6B).
These results indicate that, whereas nucleolin does not seem
to play a role in the initial macropinocytic uptake of AS1411,
it is essential for the AS1411-induced stimulation of macropinocytosis. Consequently, nucleolin is also essential for the
induced uptake of AS1411 that occurs at later time points.

Discussion
AS1411 is a first-in-class experimental drug that has
already been tested in early clinical trials with promising
results. The primary goal of our current research is to gain
a better understanding about the mechanism of AS1411

Role of Macropinocytosis in AS1411 Uptake and Mechanism

with 30 nmol/L of one of three different nucleolin siRNAs (NCL1, NCL2, and NCL3), a control siRNA (scramble, S), or contransfected with 10 nmol/L of
each nucleolin siRNAs (mix). A, cells were lysed, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the antibodies shown. B, cell surface proteins
from intact transfected DU145 cells were labeled and captured as described in Materials and Methods and then analyzed by blotting with anti-nucleolin
antibody (NCL). After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with antibodies for a plasma membrane marker (anti-pan Cadherin) and a nuclear marker
(histone 3) to confirm fractionation. Total lysate (Lys) was used as control. C, the medium of transfected cells was replaced by fresh complete medium

activity, which we believe is important for several reasons.
Knowledge of the factors that determine response to
AS1411 might ultimately be translated into clinical tests that
could identify patients with the best chance of benefiting
from treatment with AS1411. Given the difficulties of achieving clinically relevant dosing of AS1411 in animal models (i.e.,
a 7-day continuous i.v. infusion), understanding how AS1411
works in cultured cancer cells will likely be the most expeditious route to identify candidate biomarkers, which can then
be evaluated retrospectively or prospectively in human clinical trials of AS1411. In addition, comprehending how AS1411
is able to preferentially affect cancer cells compared with nonmalignant cells may lead to new insights into cancer biology.
In particular, AS1411 has turned out to be a valuable tool to
probe the functions of nucleolin, a protein that is increasingly
being recognized as an important target in cancer therapy. Already, our investigations of AS1411 have revealed previously
unrecognized functions for nucleolin in NF-κB signaling (3)

www.aacrjournals.org

and PRMT5 localization (6) and have now led to the discovery
of another novel role in stimulating macropinocytosis.
Previously, we identified nucleolin as the target of AS1411
and subsequently predicted that it would act as a receptor
for AS1411 (2, 13). This hypothesis was attractive because
it provided a possible explanation for the tumor selectivity
of AS1411 based on the reasoning that nucleolin expression
is higher in cancer cells compared with normal cells, and
therefore, we expected there would be selective uptake of
AS1411 in cancer cells. However, the new data presented here
show that these hypotheses were incorrect. We found that
initial uptake of AS1411 is not higher in cancer cells compared with Hs27 nonmalignant skin fibroblasts that are not
responsive to AS1411. Instead, it seems that initial uptake of
AS1411 in cancer cells occurs via macropinocytosis, whereas
uptake of AS1411 occurs by other mechanisms in Hs27 cells.
These intriguing results suggest it may be the mechanism of
uptake, as opposed to the level of uptake, that is key to

determining whether a cell is sensitive to AS1411 activity.
Therefore, we now advocate a new model to explain the cancer selectivity of AS1411, which involves uptake by macropinocytosis in cancer cells (Fig. 7). Studies using other cancer
cell lines and nonmalignant cell types are ongoing to determine whether the results observed here can be generalized.
Thus far, we have observed uptake by macropinocytosis and
subsequent stimulation of macropinocytosis in all cells that
respond to AS1411.4 Although we do not know yet why uptake by macropinocytosis and stimulation of macropinocytosis are so important for AS1411 activity, there are a number
of possibilities that seem plausible. Macropinosomes are believed to be leaky compared with other endosomal vesicles,
and their cargo can bypass degradative processing (22, 25,

30). Therefore, the response of cells that take up AS1411 by
macropinocytosis could be related to the ability of AS1411 to
escape from macropinosomes in these cells, whereas uptake
by nonmacropinocytic pathways is expected to lead to endosomal trapping and/or lysosomal degradation. Alternatively
(or in addition), it is possible that the selective effects of
AS1411 on cancer cells occurs because treatment of these
cells leads to hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis, which
has been recently described as a novel form of cell death
(27–29). Final proof of these ideas must await the development of new approaches for long-term inhibition of macropinocytosis, because the current inhibitors are toxic when
applied to cells for more than a few hours. However, there
is precedent for the idea that drug activity can depend on
the mechanism of uptake, rather than uptake efficiency, including a recent example showing that biological activity of
an antisense oligonucleotide was dependent on the route of
endocytic internalization (31).

Role of Macropinocytosis in AS1411 Uptake and Mechanism

Direct confirmation of the role of nucleolin in mediating
the antiproliferative effects of AS1411 is similarly challenging
because long-term inhibition of nucleolin is also cytotoxic,
but our new data clearly point to an essential function for
nucleolin in AS1411's ability to stimulate macropinocytosis
in cancer cells. The precise mechanism by which nucleolin
regulates AS1411-induced macropinocytosis in cancer cells
remains unknown. Macropinocytosis stimulation was not
an early cellular response to AS1411 but was typically observed after 24 to 48 hours of treatment, suggesting that it
might require changes in protein expression. Thus, it may
be relevant that nucleolin can regulate gene expression by
various transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms
(5, 12, 32–35). Our confocal images showed that AS1411
was never localized in the nuclear region of cells (except

dead cells) even after treatment for more than 2 days (data
not shown). Presumably then, the effects of AS1411 are on
extranuclear nucleolin functions, such as shuttling, signal
transduction, or modulating mRNA stability, which could
also affect protein expression. This idea is entirely consistent
with our previously proposed hypothesis that the effects of
AS1411 stem from it binding to a subset of nucleolin complexes and thereby interfering with certain functions of nucleolin (2, 13). Interestingly, nucleolin has been implicated in
the uptake of plasmids and DNA nanoparticles in previous
independent studies (20, 36), although the relevance of these
to AS1411 is unknown at present. Another recent publication
has reported nucleolin as a receptor for AS1411 (37). These
authors reported that binding of AS1411 to the surface of
MV-4-11 leukemia cells was inhibited by preincubation with

Figure 7. A new model to explain the cancer-selective antiproliferative activity of AS1411. A cartoon comparing the previous model for AS1411 uptake
with a revised model that is consistent with the new results. Key features of the new model are that it is the mechanism of uptake (rather than the levels of
uptake) that determine response to AS1411 and that uptake occurs by macropinocytosis in cancer cells. In the new model, nucleolin does not act as a
classic cell surface receptor but is essential for the stimulation of macropinocytosis by AS1411, which leads to further uptake of the aptamer. We
hypothesize that, in cancer cells, uptake by macropinocytosis allows endosomal escape of AS1411 (because macropinosomes are relatively leaky) and/or
that AS1411 induces cell death due to hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis. We propose that the lack of response in normal cells may be due to the
different AS1411 uptake route leading to endosomal entrapment or lysosomal degradation and/or the inability of AS1411 to stimulate macropinocytosis in
these cells because they have lower levels of nucleolin. Further research is required to test these hypotheses.

a nucleolin antibody (MS3) and that uptake (measured at 2–6
hours) was reduced in MCF-7 cells that were stably transfected with nucleolin short hairpin RNA (37). These results
seem to be at variance with our findings in DU145 cells,
where neither an antibody that binds surface nucleolin
(D3) nor nucleolin siRNA had any inhibitory effect on
AS1411 uptake at 2 hours (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S5).
Further research to explore the mechanism and applications of AS1411-induced macropinocytosis seems to be
worthwhile. Macropinocytosis has been most widely explored in immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic
cells, where it serves to “sample” the extracellular fluid for
the presence of pathogens, but is also induced by oncogenes
and growth factor signaling (16, 28, 29, 38, 39), so it is perhaps unsurprising that it occurs in cancer cells. Moreover,
macropinocytosis is emerging as a key mechanism for intracellular delivery of various physiologic, pathologic, and therapeutic cargoes. This process has been reported as an entry
portal for a range of macromolecules, including numerous
cell penetrating peptides (23, 40), intact proteins (41–43),
bacterial virulence factors (44), Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (45), naked DNA plasmid (18–20), and many
viruses (46). Remarkably, the uptake and effects of AS1411
are somewhat reminiscent of some cell penetrating peptides
(also called protein transduction domains) and viruses,
which can be taken up by macropinocytosis and then cause
stimulation of macropinocytosis (23–25). Furthermore, there
is substantial interest in the uptake mechanisms of oligonucleotides in general, largely because poor cellular delivery is a
major hurdle in developing oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, including siRNAs (47). Interestingly, one of the most
successful methods for in vivo siRNA to date may involve

macropinocytosis (30). Thus, studying the uptake of AS1411
(one of the few oligonucleotides that has activity in cultured
cells without the need for transfection agents and which has
progressed to clinical testing) may well lead to insights that
will help create novel strategies for siRNA delivery. Similarly,
our results may be relevant to efforts to improve delivery of
plasmid DNA, because several recent reports have suggested
that macropinocytosis is the major mechanism for uptake of
naked DNA in cells and in mice (18–20). In summary, our
novel findings regarding AS1411 might have broad implications for drug delivery and gene therapy strategies.
