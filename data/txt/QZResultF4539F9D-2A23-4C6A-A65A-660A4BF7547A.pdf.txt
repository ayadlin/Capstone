Abstract
Drug resistance is a growing problem that necessitates new strategies to combat
pathogens. Neutrophil phagocytosis and production of intracellular ROS, in particular,
has been shown to cooperate with antibiotics in the killing of microbes. This study
tested the hypothesis that p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, regulates production
of intracellular ROS. Genetic knockout of p85α in mice caused decreased expression
of catalytic subunits p110α, p110β, and p110δ, but did not change expression levels
of the NADPH oxidase complex subunits p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox. When p85α,
p55α, and p50α (all encoded by Pik3r1) were deleted, there was an increase in
intracellular ROS with no change in phagocytosis in response to both Fcγ receptor
and complement receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the increased intracellular ROS
correlated with significantly improved neutrophil killing of both methicillin-susceptible
and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Our findings suggest inhibition of p85α as novel
approach to improving the clearance of resistant pathogens.

Introduction

then becomes a fully internalized phagosome where
microorganisms are isolated and exposed to toxic levels of
superoxide (O2-) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS)
[11]. The NADPH oxidase complex is located within the
phagosome membrane and it is made up of membranebound gp91phox and p22phox; and cytosolic p47phox, p67phox,
p40phox, and Rac2 [12, 13]. Individuals with chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD) demonstrate the importance
of NADPH oxidase function for human health, as these
patients lack a functional NADPH oxidase complex, and
thus suffer from recurrent and severe bacterial and fungal
infections [10, 14, 15].
A variety of receptors on neutrophil membranes
contribute to the recognition of opsonized material. Two
of the most important receptors are Fcγ receptors (FcγRs),
which bind to IgG-coated pathogens, and complement

Staphylococcus aureus make up a large proportion
of human infections worldwide, causing various diseases
that range from acute skin infections to life-threatening
systemic toxic shock syndromes. The rise of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) and other antibiotic-resistant
strains has sparked the need for new treatment strategies in
both immunodeficient and immunocompetent individuals
[1-5]. Neutrophils are part of the innate immune system
and are critical for clearing S. aureus infections. They
are the first responders to invading bacteria and kill
microbes using reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced
by the NADPH oxidase complex [1, 6-10]. During
ingestion, neutrophils first form a phagosomal cup, which

receptors (CRs), which bind C3b on complement-coated
pathogens [16-18]. FcγR or CR binding causes the
cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase to translocate
to gp91phox/p22phox at the membrane. Downstream of these
receptors are many signaling molecules that regulate
NADPH oxidase assembly and activation, including
Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K is a
heterodimer consisting of a regulatory subunit (p85α,
p55α, p50α, or p85β) and a catalytic subunit (p110α,
p110β, or p110δ) and phosphorylates the lipid PI(4,5)P2 to
produce PI(3,4,5)P3 [12, 13]. Furthermore, pharmacologic
inhibition and genetic ablation of the catalytic subunits
have been shown to decrease neutrophil ROS production
in response to IgG-zymosan and Aspergillus fumigatus
hyphae [16, 19]. However, the specific role of p85α, the
most abundant regulatory subunit of Class IA PI3K, has
not been fully studied.
We previously found that a functional binding site on
p47phox for Class IA PI3K-derived phospho-lipids, PI(3,4)P2
and PI(3,4,5)P3, is needed for extracellular ROS production,
but is dispensable for intracellular ROS production
during early phagocytosis [20]. This finding is consistent
with the observation that PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3
are found on the early phagosomal cup at the location of
and during the time of extracellular ROS production, but
are not detected on the mature, internalized phagosome.
Notably, p85α, the regulatory subunit of Class IA PI3K
and thus necessary for PI(3,4,5)P3 production, remains
associated with the phagosome membrane even when
PI(3,4,5)P3 is no longer present [21]. These observations
led us to hypothesize that p85α differentially influences
extracellular and intracellular NADPH oxidase activity
and performs a function on the internalized, sealed
phagosome independent of PI(3,4,5)P3 production.
To test this hypothesis, we used neutrophils
lacking p85α, p55α, and p50α (encoded by Pik3r1),
and distinguished production of extra- and intracellular
ROS. We found that the PI3K regulatory subunits are not
necessary for formation of the early phagosome cup or
for production of extracellular ROS. However, we show
that the loss of p85α leads to enhanced intracellular ROS,
which also contributed to improved killing of methicillinsusceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA).
Our work provides a novel target in the regulation
of enhancing neutrophil intracellular ROS, which has been
shown to cooperate with anti-microbial agents to increase
bacterial killing [22, 23]. This is an improvement over
indiscriminately increasing global ROS production, which
could lead to inflammation-induced tissue injury. Using
intracellular ROS to augment anti-microbial therapies may
provide a novel strategy in the treatment of antibioticresistant pathogens.

Loss of regulatory subunits p85α, p55α, and p50α
decreases extracellular ROS production, but
increases intracellular ROS production
As global knockout of Pik3r1-/- leads to perinatal
lethality [24], timed matings were performed between
Pik3r1+/- mice for the isolation of fetal liver-derived
hematopoietic cells at 14.5 days post-conception. WT
(Pik3r1+/+), Pik3r1+/-, and Pik3r1-/- (lacking expression of
p85α, p55α, and p50α) [24, 25] fetal liver mononuclear
cells were differentiated in vitro to neutrophils [20], and
each population demonstrated similar differentiation as
assessed by morphology and Mac-1/Gr-1 staining (Figure
1A and 1B). Consistent with previous studies reporting
increased PI3K catalytic subunit degradation upon loss of
the stabilizing regulatory subunits [24, 26], p110α, p110β,
and p110δ protein expression was substantially reduced in
the Pik3r1-/- neutrophils (Figure 1C). Notably, however,
the levels of the NADPH oxidase subunits (p67phox, p47phox,
and p40phox) were unchanged (Figure 1C).
To examine the function of the PI3K regulatory
subunits in neutrophil ROS production, we examined
both extra- and intracellular ROS production in response
to various stimuli. Pik3r1-/- neutrophils had significantly
reduced FcγR (hIgG-latex)-stimulated extracellular
ROS (50% of WT, Figure 1D), but similar amounts of
CR (SOZ)-stimulated extracellular ROS (Figure 1D).
Together with the lower expression of the PI3K catalytic
subunits, this finding supports the notion that PI3K activity
is required for extracellular ROS mediated by FcγR
stimulation, and is consistent with our previous findings
[20]. In contrast to that observed with extracellular ROS,
loss of p85α/p55α/p50α led to significantly increased
FcγR- and a trend of enhanced CR-stimulated intracellular
ROS production (Figure 1E). Both extra- and intracellular
ROS production from heterozygous Pik3r1+/- neutrophils
was similar to that of WT.
Immunoblots confirmed that activated Akt was
reduced in Pik3r1-/- neutrophils; however, myeloperoxidase
(MPO) levels were equal in WT and Pik3r1-/- cells (Figure
1F), demonstrating that the increased intracellular ROS
production in Pik3r1-/- neutrophils is due to a regulatory
effect of p85α/p55α/p50α, rather than due to reduced
MPO expression and diminished ROS consumption.
Furthermore, by immunostaining with anti-F-actin and
anti-Rac to visualize the phagosomes at 10min and 30min
post-SOZ stimulation, we found a similar phagocytic
index in WT and Pik3r1-/- neutrophils (Figure 1G and
1H), indicating that increased FcγR- and CR-stimulated
intracellular ROS levels in Pik3r1-/- neutrophils is not
merely due to enhanced phagocytosis, but to a regulatory
role of p85α/p55α/p50α on NADPH oxidase activity.

Re-introduction of p85α corrects the levels of
extra- and intracellular ROS production in
Pik3r1-/- neutrophils

Pik3r1-/- neutrophils compared to WT neutrophils at all
time points, with a trend toward statistical significance at
60 minutes (Figure 3C).
Given the promising results using fetal liver-derived
neutrophils and Wood 46 MSSA, we turned our attention
to a more relevant pathogen, MRSA. Hypervirulent
MRSA, such as LAC MRSA USA300 strain, has become
an important public health problem due to the sheer
number of infections and widespread antibiotic resistance
[3]. Consistent with results observed using MSSA, we
observed enhanced intracellular ROS in fetal liver-derived
Pik3r1-/- neutrophils compared to WT neutrophils in
response to serum-opsonized MRSA (USA300), and no
difference in extracellular ROS production (Figures 3D
and 3E). We next conducted bacterial killing assays using
a more physiologic source of neutrophils directly isolated
from the bone marrow using a percoll gradient. Since
global knockout of Pik3r1 induces perinatal lethality,
we utilized a murine model bearing a conditionally
targeted Pik3r1 allele (Pik3r1flox/flox) crossed with Mx1Cre. Pik3r1flox/flox;Mx1Cre+ and Pik3r1flox/flox;Mx1Crelittermate controls were treated with polyI:polyC to
induce recombination of the Pik3r1 allele. Animals
were permitted to recover from polyI:polyC treatment
for at least 12 weeks prior to isolation of bone marrow
neutrophils. Phenotypically and morphologically, bone
marrow neutrophils isolated directly from the Pik3r1flox/
flox
;Mx1Cre+ and Pik3r1flox/flox;Mx1Cre- bone marrow were
similar (data not shown). To control for phagocytosis,
neutrophils were incubated with GFP-expressing MRSA
for 2 hours, followed by quenching of extracellular
GFP using trypan blue. To measure bacterial killing, a
second plate was incubated for an additional 2 hours and
then quenched with trypan blue. Following quenching,
intracellular GFP levels were read immediately on a
fluorometer to measure phagocytosis and bacterial killing,
respectively. GFP-expressing MRSA were phagocytized
equally (Figure 3F); however, significantly reduced
GFP levels, previously shown to correlate with bacterial
survival [28], was observed in Pik3r1flox/flox;Mx1Cre+
neutrophils compared to Pik3r1flox/flox;Mx1Cre- neutrophils
(Figure 3G). Collectively, these findings suggest that
increased intracellular ROS production may provide
enhanced bacterial killing, in particular of MSSA and
MRSA.
Our findings demonstrate that genetic disruption of
Pi3kr1 differentially regulates NADPH oxidase activity on
the plasma membrane (extracellular ROS production) v.
the phagosome membrane (intracellular ROS production).
These novel findings are consistent with other studies
demonstrating that the regulation of NADPH oxidase
activity differs between the plasma and phagosome
membranes, and highlights the varied environments of
these two compartments. An example relevant to the
current work is the Class III PI3K product, PI3P, which is
a strong positive regulator of intracellular ROS production

We next examined the effect of re-introducing p85α
(Figure 2A) on extra- and intracellular ROS production
from Pik3r1-/- fetal liver-derived neutrophils [27]. We
found comparable neutrophil differentiation (Mac-1, Gr1) between Pik3r1-/- neutrophils and Pik3r1-/- neutrophils
upon re-introduction of p85α (Figure 2B). Protein
levels of PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ were increased
upon re-introduction of p85α, and concordantly, Akt
phosphorylation was normalized (Figure 2C). Moreover,
p85α restored hIgG-latex-stimulated extracellular ROS
levels and inhibited hIgG-latex-stimulated intracellular
ROS compared to Pik3r1-/- neutrophils (Figures 2D, 2E,
and 2F). Consistent with a dispensable role of p85 α, p55α,
and p50α on SOZ-stimulated extracellular ROS (Figure
1D), re-introduction of p85α did not alter SOZ-stimulated
extracellular ROS production from Pik3r1-/- neutrophils
(Figure 2G); however, SOZ-stimulated intracellular
ROS was inhibited by re-introduction of p85α. These
findings demonstrate that of the PI3K regulatory subunits,
p85α uniquely is able to negatively regulate hIgG-latexand SOZ-stimulated intracellular ROS production.
Furthermore, as the C-terminal portion of p85α (nSH2,
iSH2, and cSH2 domains, the shared domains between
the p85α, p55α, and p50α regulatory proteins) is critical
for promoting PI3K activity, these findings suggest that
the N-terminus of p85α (SH3 and BH domains) functions
to negatively regulate intracellular ROS.

Elevated intracellular ROS in Pik3r1-/- neutrophils
enhances bacterial killing
Based on our observation that Pik3r1-/- fetal liverderived neutrophils have increased intracellular ROS
production in response to Fcγ receptor and CR stimulation,
we predicted that Pik3r1-/- neutrophils would demonstrate
enhanced S. aureus-stimulated ROS production and
enhanced bacterial killing compared to WT neutrophils.
Consistent with our hypothesis, Pik3r1-/- fetal liverderived neutrophils produce more intracellular ROS in
response to serum-opsonized MSSA (Wood 46), while
the extracellular ROS levels were not affected (Figures
3A and 3B).
To determine the antimicrobial function of Pik3r1-/neutrophils, we performed a bacterial killing assay.
WT and Pik3r1-/- fetal liver-derived neutrophils were
incubated with serum-opsonized methicillin-sensitive S.
aureus (MSSA) (Wood 46) over 60 min, and at various
time points, neutrophil samples were quenched in ice-cold
LB-saponin, sonicated to liberate ingested bacteria, and
surviving bacteria were enumerated by plating on LBagar. Surviving MSSA was reduced when incubated with

but plays no role in extracellular ROS production. A key
molecule increasing Class III PI3K activity and increased
PI3P production on the phagosome is the Rab GTPase,
Rab5. Down-regulation of Rab5 reduces the capacity of
S. aureus-containing phagosomes to fuse with endocytic
organelles resulting in poorer bacterial killing [29].
Notably, p85α is known to interact with Rab5 and to
bear GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) activity towards
Rab5-GTP, which is localized to the p85α BH domain
(Figure 2A). These considerations suggest that a feasible
mechanism underlying the negative regulatory effect
of p85 α on intracellular ROS may be downregulating
Rab5a-GTP levels via its GAP function [30, 31], resulting
in reduced Class III PI3K-derived PI3P. Thus, while
our current work cannot exclude the possibility that
p85α negatively regulates intracellular ROS production
in an indirect manner due to altered expression of the
Class IA PI3K catalytic subunits, a thought-provoking
consideration is that p85 α functions in a Class IA PI3K
catalytic subunit-independent manner to regulate NADPH
oxidase activity on the phagosome membrane.
Collectively, our findings show that neutrophils
lacking the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α produce
significantly more intracellular ROS without affecting
phagocytosis. Furthermore, this correlates to significantly
increased killing of both MSSA and MRSA. These results
suggest a new strategy for combating the growing threat
of resistant microorganisms.

(Ser473), or -MPO (Cell Signaling). Blots were then
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and
signal was visualized with ECL detection (Pierce).

Confocal microscopy
SOZ-induced phagocytosis in WT and Pik3r1-/- fetal
liver-derived neutrophils was imaged using a spinningdisk (CSU10) confocal system mounted on a Nikon
TE-2000U inverted microscope with an Ixon air-cooled
EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, South Windsor,
CT) and a Nikon Plan Apo 100X 1.4 N.A. objective
as described previously [16, 20, 21]. Images were
analyzed with Metamorph software (Universal Imaging;
Downington, PA).

Animal husbandry
Mice were housed and bred in accordance with
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Indiana University School of Medicine. Pik3r1+/- mice
[24, 25] were subjected to timed matings, dams were
euthanized at day 14 post-conception, and fetal livers
were harvested for generation of Pik3r1+/+, Pik3r1+/-, and
Pik3r1-/- neutrophils. Pik3r1flox/flox mice [36] were crossed
with Mx1-Cre+ mice to produce Pik3r1flox/flox; Mx1-Cre+
mice. Cre expression was induced by 3 intraperitoneal
injections of polyI:polyC (300ug), and recombination of
Pik3r1 was confirmed by genotyping.

Materials and Methods

Neutrophil differentiation

Preparation of particulate stimuli

Fetal liver cells were collected from embryos at
day 14 of gestation, genotyped, and differentiated into
neutrophils in α-minimum essential medium with 20%
heat-inactivated FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 50ng/
ml G-CSF and 50units/ml IL-3. Every 2 days, cells were
counted and replated at a concentration of 0.5×106/ml in
fresh differentiation medium. Activity was analyzed on
days 6 and 7 of differentiation [20].

Human IgG-opsonized latex beads (1.98 µm or
2.94µm), serum opsonized-zymosan A particles (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA), and serum-opsonized MSSA (Wood
46) were prepared as previously described [32-34]. MRSA
USA300 (LAC) expressing superfolded GFP was grown
overnight at 37°C with shaking, OD600 was measured
to identify mid-logarithmic growth, and bacteria were
washed with PBS before adding to PMNs [35]. Final
concentrations were 5:1 IgG-beads/PMNs; 400 µg/
ml SOZ; 40:1 S. aureus/PMNs; 60 µg/ml hyphae; 50:1
MRSA/PMNs.

Reintroduction of p85α
p85α cDNA was cloned upstream of an internal
entry site (IRES) and the enhanced green fluorescence
protein (EGFP) in the bicistronic retroviral plasmid,
pMIEG3 [37]. Alternatively, p85α was tagged on the
C-terminal end with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and
cloned into the retroviral plasmid, pMSCV (Clontech).
Ecotropic retrovirus containing the vectors was used
to transduce Pik3r1-/- fetal liver cells, cells were sorted
for EGFP or YFP positivity, and differentiated into
neutrophils. Data using both constructs are combined
for statistical analyses, as the YFP tag did not alter the

Western blots
Cell lysates were prepared from murine neutrophils
using 1% Triton X-100, 15 µg lysate was subjected to
SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting using a
nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Scientific). Blots were
blocked with 5% BSA and then incubated overnight with
anti-p85α, -p110δ (Santa Cruz);anti-p67phox, -p47phox,
-p40phox (Millipore); anti-p110a, -p110b, -phospho-Akt

Mice were sacrificed, bone marrow cells were
collected from the pelvis, femur, and tibia, and neutrophils
were isolated using a 62% and 55% percoll gradient.
Neutrophils were washed in Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), resuspended in Iscove’s
Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), and plated at 2x105 cells per well
into a 96well plate coated with celltak (Corning, Corning,
NY, USA). MRSA (USA300 strain LAC) was incubated
with neutrophils for 2h at 37°C, and then plates were
washed with warm PBS. For phagocytosis analysis, 50uL
of 500mg/mL trypan blue was added immediately to
PBS-washed plates to quench extracellular fluorescence.
For bacterial survival analysis, PBS-washed plates were
incubated for an additional 2h at 37°C followed by the
addition of 50uL of 500mg/mL trypan blue. For both
phagocytosis and bacterial killing analyses, plates were
read on a fluorometer to measure intracellular GFP
fluorescence promptly following the addition of trypan
blue. Fluorescence intensity correlates to bacterial survival
based on the previously defined correlation of HOClbleaching of superfolded GFP to bacterial viability.
