Summary
Angiosarcoma/lymphangiosarcoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis. We generated a
mouse model with inducible endothelial cell-specific deletion of Tsc1 to examine mTORC1
signaling in lymphangiosarcoma. Tsc1 loss increased retinal angiogenesis in neonates, and led to
endothelial proliferative lesions from vascular malformations to vascular tumors in adult mice.
Sustained mTORC1 signaling was required for lymphangiosarcoma development and
maintenance. Increased VEGF expression in tumor cells was seen, and blocking autocrine VEGF
signaling abolished vascular tumor development and growth. We also found significant
correlations between mTORC1 activation and VEGF, HIF1α, and c-Myc expression in human
angiosarcoma samples. These studies demonstrated critical mechanisms of aberrant mTORC1
activation in lymphangiosarcoma, and validate the mice as a valuable model for further study.

Introduction
The establishment and remodeling of blood and lymphatic vessels is tightly controlled by
several signaling pathways. Disruption or aberrations of these pathways can lead to vascular
tumors or malformations according to their clinical behavior and endothelial cell (EC)
characteristics. Vascular tumors are formed from endothelial hyperplasia; vascular
malformations have a quiescent endothelium (Enjolras and Mulliken, 1997). Angiosarcomas
are rare but malignant vascular tumors derived from the abnormal proliferation of ECs. The
prognosis for patients is very poor, with a reported 5-year survival rate of approximately
10% (Pawlik et al., 2003).

Author Manuscript

Lymphangiosarcomas are angiosarcomas with lymphatic differentiation. Morphologic
diagnosis of lymphangiosarcomas is usually impossible, so pathologists have used the term
angiosarcoma to encompass both. Recently, antigens preferentially expressed by lymphatic
ECs (VEGFR3, PROX1, LYVE1 and Podoplanin) have been discovered, which allow
lymphangiosarcomas to be defined pathologically (Mankey et al., 2010; Miettinen and
Wang, 2012; Quarmyne et al., 2012). Inherited vascular malformations allowed
identification of genetic causes for some vascular anomalies (Enjolras et al., 2007). For
example, Milroy’s primary congenital lymphedema to VEGFR3 (Karkkainen et al., 2000).
Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
vascular anomalies is still limited. The initiating molecular events in existing animal models
of vascular tumors are largely uncharacterized and their relevance to human vascular tumors
is uncertain (Cohen et al., 2009).

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that coordinates
numerous cellular processes (Foster and Fingar, 2010). Dysfunction of mTORC1 signaling
has been implicated in diseases including vascular tumors and malformations (Du et al.,
2013; Shirazi et al., 2007). Knockdown of S6K reduced vascular tumor cell proliferation and
migration, and topical application of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, inhibited vascular
tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model (Du et al., 2013). mTORC1 is also implicated in
EC transformation in Kaposi’s sarcoma, a subtype of vascular tumor, through a series of
elegant studies by Gutkind and colleagues. These studies showed that a G protein-coupled
receptor activates Akt/mTORC1 signaling to induce sarcomagenesis (Montaner et al., 2003;
Sodhi et al., 2006). Rapamycin has been successfully used for treating Kaposi’s sarcoma in
humans (Stallone et al., 2005) and has shown promising results in clinic trials treating other
vascular anomalies (Hammill et al., 2011; Lackner et al., 2015; Riou et al., 2012). Studies
link mTORC1 signaling and vascular anomalies, but it remains to be determined whether
hyperactivation of mTORC1 in ECs is sufficient to induce angiosarcomas with aggressive
and metastatic features responsible for lethality.
mTORC1 is negatively regulated by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressor
proteins TSC1 and TSC2 (Kwiatkowski, 2003). Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 result in benign
malformations or tumors in many different organs, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis in
the lungs, and angiomyolipomas in the kidney (Crino et al., 2006). VEGFA, a downstream
effector of the mTORC1 (El-Hashemite et al., 2003), is a robust mitogen for ECs. Vascular
tumors have been shown to express high levels of VEGFA (Boscolo and Bischoff, 2009),

which may result in autocrine stimulation of neoplastic ECs. Elevated VEGFA in
hemangiomas can be reduced by rapamycin (Medici and Olsen, 2012), suggesting a
potential link between TSC/mTORC1 signaling and vascular tumors. However, it is not clear
whether increased mTORC1 signaling is a downstream effect or plays an early and causal
role in the development of vascular tumors.

RESULTS
Human angiosarcomas show increased mTORC1 signaling

Author Manuscript

We prepared tissue arrays of multiple human angiosarcoma samples and checked signaling
pathway changes by immunohistochemistry. mTORC1 signaling was highly activated in
human angiosarcomas. The majority of angiosarcoma samples (46/65, or 71%, p< 0.01)
showed strong staining for phosphorylated S6 (pS6), a marker for mTORC1 activation
(Figures 1A, B and S1), whereas few quiescent blood vessels in normal tissues were positive
(4/32, or 12%). These data raised the possibility that deregulated mTORC1 signaling plays a
role in the development of human angiosarcomas.
mTORC1 activation promotes neonatal retinal angiogenesis in Tsc1iΔEC mice

Author Manuscript

We generated a mouse model for mTORC1 activation in ECs by specific deletion of its
upstream inhibitor Tsc1. We crossed Tsc1f/f mice (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002) with End-SclCre-ERT transgenic mice that express tamoxifen-activated Cre recombinase in ECs (Gothert
et al., 2004) to produce Tsc1f/f;Scl-Cre mice. We used the neonatal retinal model to examine
defects in postnatal angiogenesis upon Tsc1 deletion. The retina is avascular at birth, and a
superficial vascular plexus grows progressively from the center toward the periphery during
week 1 after birth (Pitulescu et al., 2010). Administration of tamoxifen to Tsc1f/f;Scl-Cre
mice (designated as Tsc1iΔEC mice after induced Tsc1 deletion) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to
P3 induced activation of Cre recombinase in the retinal endothelium (Figures 1C, D),
resulting in an efficient reduction of Tsc1 expression in ECs, as measured by
immunoblotting analyses of lysates of ECs from the lungs at P5 (Figures 1E, F). Increased
phosphorylation of S6 was found in Tsc1iΔEC ECs relative to controls, indicating activation
of mTORC1 upon Tsc1 deletion in these cells as expected. We also observed decreased Akt
phosphorylation in the mutant cells, consistent with previous reports of its feedback
inhibition by activated mTORC1 (Foster and Fingar, 2010)(Figures 1E, F). Examination of
the retinal vasculature at P5 by isolectin B4 staining showed significantly increased vascular
branching and EC coverage in Tsc1iΔEC retinas compared to controls (Figures 1G, H).

Author Manuscript

We next examined EC proliferation in the sprouting vessels by staining for phosphorylated
histone H3 (pH3) to identify mitotic cells (Figure 1I, arrows). pH3 positive ECs were mostly
in the periphery of the sprouting vasculature in control retinas, but were detected in both
peripheral and central locations of the vessels in Tsc1iΔEC retinas. Quantitative analysis of
pH3 labeling showed an approximately 2-fold increase in the number of mitotic cells per
field in Tsc1iΔEC retinas (Figure 1J). These results suggest that hyperactivation of mTORC1
signaling upon Tsc1 loss leads to increased postnatal angiogenesis and abnormal vascular
patterning by promoting EC proliferation.

Development of vascular tumors with EC-specific Tsc1 deletion in adult mice

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Unlike embryonic and neonatal ECs which undergo rapid proliferation during angiogenesis,
adult ECs have a low rate of turnover under normal conditions (Hobson and Denekamp,
1984). To evaluate the effect of Tsc1 loss in ECs of adult mice, we administered tamoxifen
to 2-month-old Tsc1f/f;Scl-Cre mice and control Tsc1f/f mice (Figure S2A). At 3 months or
more after tamoxifen treatment, Tsc1iΔEC mice developed cutaneous tumors in tails and
paws (Figure 2A). MRI scans also revealed tumor formation in the livers of Tsc1iΔEC mice
(Figure 2B, arrows in right panel), confirmed at necropsy (Figure 2C). At 3–4 months after
tamoxifen administration, nearly half of the Tsc1iΔEC mice had developed liver tumors and
about 30% had cutaneous tumors (Figure 2D). By 6–8 months after tamoxifen, almost all the
Tsc1iΔEC mice developed liver tumors, and about 80% showed cutaneous tumors (Figure
2E). At the later time point, cutaneous tumors were also observed in other areas such as lips
and legs, although at lower frequencies. Tsc1iΔEC mice had a significantly reduced lifespan
(Figure 2F). No cutaneous or liver vascular anomalies were found in the control mice with
the same tamoxifen treatment at any time, and they lived beyond one year as expected.
Similar tail and liver tumors were observed in a small fraction of either Tsc1+/− or Tsc2+/−
heterozygous mice (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002; Onda et al., 1999). Therefore, our results
validate the critical role of mTORC1 activation in the development of these tumors, indicate
the EC origin of the tumor, and provide a mouse model with high penetrance.

Histological examination of liver sections of Tsc1iΔEC mice showed increased numbers of
portal vein profiles within the portal tracts expanding into the adjacent lobular hepatic
parenchyma. These lesions were well-differentiated and composed of anastomosing vascular
channels lined by hyperplastic and atypical ECs (Figure 2G, panel b). Analysis of the liver
vascular networks by vascular casting and microCT imaging showed organized, hierarchical
branching patterns in Ctrl mice (Figure 2H, left). In Tsc1iΔEC mice, however, multiple
irregular vascular tributaries were observed in the neoplasm area. Nevertheless, they still
connected to the main hepatic vasculature, consistent with benign biological behavior
(Figure 2H, right). This histology is consistent with at least an atypical vascular
malformation or a benign low grade vascular tumor. Similar liver tumors (liver
hemangiomas) were observed in Tsc1+/− heterozygous mice (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002). The
atypical ECs expressed EC markers CD31 and vWF, but not lymphatic EC markers PROX1,
Podoplanin, or VEGFR3 (Figures 2I, S2B). The liver vascular lesions likely arose from
differentiated ECs with a more restricted vascular phenotype.

Author Manuscript

In contrast to the benign liver lesions, histological examination of the cutaneous vascular
anomalies demonstrated infiltrative masses within the dermis and subcutis comprised of
solid areas of bundles and whorls of poorly defined spindled ECs with minimal to no
erythrocytes (Figure 2G, panel d) and more differentiated areas with anastomosing vascular
channels with epithelioid ECs with lumina occasionally containing organizing thrombi. In
some mice, these vascular sarcomatous areas are associated with a vascular malformation
composed of thin walled round to irregular nonanastomosing vascular channels lined by
round to oval ECs. These vessels lack pericytes and smooth muscle within the wall. The
neoplastic cells were strongly immunoreactive to CD31, PROX1, Podoplanin and VEGFR3
consistent with lymphangiosarcoma (Figures 2I, S2B). PROX1 expression in vascular

tumors was reported in a recent study of human patient samples (Miettinen and Wang,
2012). Our results suggested that the cutaneous tumors were derived from lymphatic ECs or
less differentiated endothelial precursors with the potential for vascular or lymphatic
differentiation.
Vascular tumor progression and metastasis in Tsc1iΔEC mice

Author Manuscript

As early as one month after tamoxifen administration, some Tsc1iΔEC mice showed signs of
edema with swelling in paws and tails (Figure 3A), which correlated with hyperplasia of
PROX1 positive lymphatic channels within the dermis (Figure 3B, S3). Chronic
lymphedema is a risk factor for lymphangiosarcoma in humans (Azurdia et al., 1999). At
later time points (~8 weeks), we observed cutaneous vascular lesions of thin-walled, welldifferentiated vascular channels, consistent with vascular malformations (Figure 3C, panel
a). These early lesions showed positive PROX1 staining (see insets), suggesting that they
were lymphatic malformations, although they contained various amount of blood. Moreover,
these malformations had a low Ki67 proliferative index of 2%–3% (Figure 3C, panel c;
Figure 3D), compared to nearly 0% for normal ECs. They may have been lesions that would
develop into malignant lymphangiosarcomas at a later time in Tsc1iΔEC mice, with solid
tumor masses and an elevated Ki67 index of about 30% (Figure 3C, panels b, d; Figure 3D).
In some samples, both malformation and lymphangiosarcoma could be found in the same
tumor, representing a lesion in the process of transition from malformation to
lymphangiosarcoma (Figure 3E). In these, the vascular malformation ECs still showed the
normal flat shape (blue arrows, upper right), whereas those in the lymphangiosarcoma
portion have an atypical plump appearance with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli (red
arrows, lower right).

Author Manuscript

One month after tamoxifen injection, liver sections of Tsc1iΔEC mice showed localized areas
with increased portal vein profiles (Figure 3F, panel a). Tumor compression was not
identified within the main portal vein, but by imaging there were malformed branches of the
portal arteriovenous system that suggested gross localized lesions. These areas of increased
portal veins represent localized venous malformations with no atypia and low proliferative
index of 2% (Figure 3F, panel c; Figure 3D). Similar to the cutaneous lesions, the liver
venous malformations were probably in transition to larger liver lesions that contained
anastomosing vascular channels with areas suggestive of atypical venous malformation to
low grade benign vascular tumors with increased proliferative index of 8% at later time
points (Figure 3F, panels b, d; Figure 3D).

Author Manuscript

The poorly differentiated cutaneous lymphangiosarcomas of Tsc1iΔEC mice were highly
invasive and on the extremities, frequently showed local invasion into bone (Figure 3G).
Small metastatic nodules were found in the lymphatic vessels near the primary tumors
(Figure 3H). The metastatic cells (yellow arrows) in the nodules expressed EC markers
CD31 and VEGFR2 and lymphatic EC marker VEGFR3, which also stained lymphatic
vessels (red arrows) as expected. Macrometastases were commonly present in lymph nodes
(Figure 3I) and also found at lower frequencies in distant sites such as the sternal
musculature (Figure 3J). The tumor cells at these sites also stained positively for CD31 and
PROX1, suggesting that these macrometastases and micrometastatic nodules were derived

from primary cutaneous lymphangiosarcomas in the Tsc1iΔEC mice. These results
demonstrate that Tsc1 deletion in adult ECs leads to vascular malformations that may
progress to malignant cutaneous lymphangiosarcoma. They recapitulate many features of
human lymphangio/angiosarcomas including invasion and metastasis (Pawlik et al., 2003),
suggesting the utility of the Tsc1iΔEC mice as a model for human vascular tumors.
Increased proliferation and migration of Tsc1iΔEC tumor cells contribute to vascular tumor
development and progression in a cell-autonomous manner

Author Manuscript

To investigate mechanisms, primary cells were isolated from cutaneous
lymphangiosarcomas of Tsc1iΔEC mice and lungs of control Tsc1f/f mice. Tsc1iΔEC ECs and
control primary ECs were of high purity based on their morphology, staining with CD31,
and DiI-Ac-LDL uptake assays (Figure S4). As expected, Tsc1iΔEC ECs showed
significantly decreased Tsc1 expression compared to controls (see Figure 6B below).
Consistent with the results in vivo, Tsc1iΔEC ECs showed increased proliferation in vitro as
measured by BrdU incorporation (Figure 4A). Analysis of cell migration using wound
closure assay showed increased migration of Tsc1iΔEC ECs compared to controls (Figure
4B). We next assessed the angiogenic activity of Tsc1iΔEC ECs using a Matrigel culture
capillary formation assay, a process that mimics sprouting and tube formation during
angiogenesis in vivo. As shown in Figure 4C, Tsc1iΔEC ECs had significantly increased
tubule formation relative to controls, measured by tubule length, number of branch points,
and percentage of area covered by ECs.

Author Manuscript

We then injected isolated ECs subcutaneously into nude mice to evaluate their
tumorigenicity. Recipient mice injected with Tsc1iΔEC ECs all developed subcutaneous
tumors after one month (Figure 4D), while none of the recipient mice with control EC
injections showed tumors (data not shown). Histological examination of the tumors showed
features of vascular tumors (Figure 4E), which was verified by strong staining for CD31 and
VEGFR3 (Figure 4F). The tumors also showed high pS6 signaling (Figure 4F), consistent
with the hyperactivation of mTORC1 in Tsc1iΔEC ECs. These results suggest that increased
mTORC1 signaling in Tsc1iΔEC ECs promotes EC proliferation and migration, confers
increased angiogenic activity, and promotes tumorigenicity in a cell-autonomous manner.
Constitutive mTORC1 activation is required for vascular tumor initiation and maintenance

Author Manuscript

We next analyzed activation of mTORC1 signaling by measuring pS6 in tumor sections
(Figure 5A, B). In contrast to the virtual absence of pS6 signals in ECs of control mouse,
tumor cells in Tsc1iΔEC mice showed significantly elevated pS6 staining. These results
suggested that aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling upon Tsc1 loss is responsible for
the vascular tumor development in Tsc1iΔEC mice. We did not detect increased pS6 in
normal vessels in Tsc1iΔEC mice (Figure S5), suggesting that altered expression patterns are
unique to the vascular lesions, possibly due to mosaic expression of Cre with tamoxifen
treatment in adult mice. We next treated Tsc1iΔEC mice with the mTORC1 inhibitor
rapamycin (5 mg/kg IP every other day) starting one week after tamoxifen injection and
examined the effects for the next 6 months (Figure 5C). Mice treated with vehicle alone
developed both liver and cutaneous anomalies as expected, while none of the Tsc1iΔEC mice
treated with rapamycin showed either of these tumors at the same time points (Figure 5D).

Author Manuscript

Histological examination of the livers and cutaneous tissues showed normal morphology for
the rapamycin treated Tsc1iΔEC mice, in contrast to the vascular tumors in the vehicle treated
mice (Figure 5E). These results show that aberrant hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling is
required for the development of vascular tumors in the Tsc1iΔEC mice.

Author Manuscript

To determine if hyperactivation of mTORC1 is also necessary for the maintenance and
growth of vascular tumors, Tsc1iΔEC mice were treated with rapamycin (5 mg/kg IP every
other day) after the formation of tumors at 3 months after tamoxifen injection (Figure 5F). In
contrast to the significant liver tumor growth in vehicle treated mice, rapamycin treatment
halted and even reduced tumor size slightly, as assessed by MRI (Figure 5G). Cutaneous
lymphangiosarcomas on tails grew by about 50% in size over 3.5 months in vehicle treated
mice, but rapamycin abolished growth of the tumors (Figure 5H). Rapamycin-treated
Tsc1iΔEC mice also exhibited significantly increased survival, with all mice still alive after
more than 6 months of Tsc1 deletion (i.e., 3 months after tamoxifen injection followed by 3
additional months with rapamycin treatment), when a significant fraction of vehicle treated
mice had died (Figure 5I, 2F). Ki67 staining showed corresponding decreases in tumor cell
proliferation after rapamycin treatment (Figure 5J), elevated pS6 was abolished (Figure 5J),
and staining for cleaved caspase 3 showed significantly increased apoptotic ECs (Figure
5K). Histological examinations of liver and cutaneous sections showed the presence of scar
tissue replacing the vascular tumor cells of Tsc1iΔEC mice after rapamycin treatment (Figure
5L). This was similar to the spontaneous selfinvoluting phase of infantile hemangioma,
which often leaves behind scar tissue (Greenberger and Bischoff, 2011). These results
indicate that sustained hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling is necessary for vascular tumor
growth and maintenance in Tsc1iΔEC mice, suggesting that mTORC1 inhibitors could be
useful in treating vascular tumors.

Increased VEGF transcription through HIF1α and c-Myc in vascular tumor cells

Author Manuscript

Having established a role for aberrant hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in the
development of vascular tumors in Tsc1iΔEC mice, we next examined mechanism. We
focused on a well-characterized downstream target controlled by mTORC1 signaling,
VEGFA, a critical regulator of angiogenesis and other vascular functions of ECs. We
examined VEGFA expression in the vascular tumors in Tsc1iΔEC mice compared to
cutaneous ECs of controls. Consistent with previous studies (Maharaj et al., 2006), we did
not detect VEGFA expression in control ECs but high VEGFA was found in ECs of the
vascular tumors (Figure 6A). Interestingly, a recent paper reported on another Tsc1 deletion
model by Darpp-32-Cre (expressed in brain and multiple other tissues) also observed
accelerated paw angiosarcomas formation and elevated VEGF mRNA (Leech et al., 2015).
To corroborate our results, we examined VEGFA expression in vitro in ECs isolated from
Tsc1iΔEC tumors. Immunoblotting showed significantly elevated VEGFA, along with
increased pS6, indicating mTORC1 activation in Tsc1iΔEC ECs compared to controls
(Figures 6B). Increased VEGFA was also detected in the culture supernatant of Tsc1iΔEC
ECs (Figure S6A). We found increased VEGFA mRNA in Tsc1iΔEC ECs, suggesting that the
upregulated VEGFA expression was likely at the transcriptional level (Figure 6C). We
examined VEGFA expression after rapamycin treatment and found a gradual decrease in
expression to barely detectable after 24 hr (Figure 6D). Analysis of vascular tumor sections

from Tsc1iΔEC mice treated with rapamycin also showed a significant decrease of VEGFA
(Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling is
responsible for increased VEGFA expression in Tsc1iΔEC ECs, which may contribute to the
development of vascular tumors.

Author Manuscript

We then examined hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 α (HIF1α) and c-Myc expression
downstream of mTORC1 (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004). In ECs, HIF-1α promotes
proliferation and VEGFA expression (Tang et al., 2004). c-Myc is also a key transcription
factor for VEGFA (Baudino et al., 2002). We found increased nuclear localization of
activated HIF1α and c-Myc in cutaneous (Figure 6F) and liver vascular tumors (Figure S6B)
of Tsc1iΔEC mice compared to the corresponding normal tissues in control mice. qRT-PCR
analysis revealed significantly increased mRNA of HIF1α, but not c-Myc, in isolated
Tsc1iΔEC ECs compared to controls (Figure 6G), suggesting that mTORC1 signaling
regulated HIF1α transcription, but affected c-Myc post-transcriptionally. Consistent with
these results, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin significantly decreased HIF1α mRNA in
Tsc1iΔEC ECs (Figure 6H). Knockdown of either HIF1α or c-Myc by siRNAs reduced
VEGFA expression (Figure 6I), suggesting both of these transcription factors are involved in
mediating VEGFA upregulation by hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling in Tsc1iΔEC ECs.
Autocrine VEGF signaling is important for the development of vascular tumors in Tsc1iΔEC
mice

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the autocrine activation of VEGF signaling in tumor cells, we first assessed the
activation status of VEGFRs by measuring autophosphorylation. We found that VEGFR2
and VEGFR3, but not VEGFR1, are activated in tumor ECs compared to normal lung ECs
of controls (Figure 7A). We then examined VEGFR downstream targets MEK1/2 and
ERK1/2. Increased MEK1/2 activation was found in vascular tumor tissues of Tsc1iΔEC
mice compared to ECs in controls (Figure 7B). We also found moderate to intense pERK1/2
immunostaining in most vascular tumors from Tsc1iΔEC mice, but not ECs of controls
(Figure 7C).

Author Manuscript

We next determined the importance of autocrine activation of VEGF signaling in Tsc1iΔEC
ECs and vascular tumor development in Tsc1iΔEC mice by employing a potent and selective
inhibitor for VEGFRs, axitinib (Hu-Lowe et al., 2008). We found axitinib treatment reduced
proliferation, migration, and tubule formation of Tsc1iΔEC ECs in vitro (Figure 7D),
suggesting a role for VEGF autocrine signaling in the increased activity of Tsc1iΔEC ECs.
We then tested the response of vascular tumors in the Tsc1iΔEC mice to axitinib. Starting at 5
months after tamoxifen treatment when vascular tumors were established, we administered
axitinib at daily intervals to the Tsc1iΔEC mice for 2 weeks (Figure 7E). Analysis of tumor
sections following treatment showed significantly decreased pERK1/2 (Figures 7F and 7G),
indicating effective inhibition of VEGF signaling. After treatment, tumors showed decreased
Ki67 staining but did not shrink, according to the CD31 staining (Figures 7F and 7G). The
number of apoptotic cells remained similar to lesions from untreated mice (Figures 7H, 7I),
suggesting that axitinib exerts an antiproliferative rather than a pro-apoptotic effect. These
results suggest that increased VEGF autocrine signaling plays an important role in the
development and maintenance of vascular tumors in Tsc1iΔEC mice.

Using the transplantation model (see Figure 4), we compared treatment benefits of axitinib
vs rapamycin as well as potential synergy of the two inhibitors. Both axitinib and rapamycin
inhibited the growth of transplanted tumors in the recipient mice. Rapamycin was more
effective in completely blocking tumor growth (Figure 7J). Concurrent treatment with both
did not generate synergetic effects, but showed similar inhibition as rapamycin alone. We
also examined the role of increased VEGFA in tumor growth, and found that knockdown of
VEGFA significantly reduced the growth of vascular tumor cells (Figure 7K). We wondered
if hyperactivation of mTORC1 also increased VEGFC and/or VEGFD expression and could
promote vascular tumor growth by stimulating EC proliferation as well as VEGFA (Lohela
et al., 2009). Expression of both VEGFC and VEGFD were increased in vascular tumors as
measured by immunoblotting and immunostaining (Figures S7A and S7B). Knockdown of
either VEGFC or VEGFD also reduced vascular tumor growth, although less than VEGFA
knockdown (Figures 7K and S7C). Our results demonstrate that VEGF autocrine signaling
triggered by aberrant hyperactivation of mTORC1 contributes to the development of
vascular tumors in Tsc1iΔEC mice, and that blockage of the VEGFR pathway could be a
rational and effective therapy for human vascular tumors.
Clinical relevance of the mTORC1/VEGF pathway in human vascular tumors

Author Manuscript

To determine the clinical relevance of an mTORC1-triggered VEGF autocrine pathway in
human vascular tumors, we analyzed the relationships between the signaling components
pS6, VEGFA, HIF1α, and c-Myc in human angiosarcoma samples by
immunohistochemistry. We found significant correlations of mTORC1 activation (measured
by pS6 level) with VEGFA, HIF1α, and c-Myc expression (Figures 8A, B). We also found
positive correlations between VEGFA, HIF1α, and c-Myc expression (Figure 8C). We
analyzed the correlation between pS6 and the proliferative status of tumor cells of human
angiosarcoma. Consistent with our mouse model, a positive correlation existed between pS6
and Ki67 staining for proliferative cells (Figures 8D, E). These results provide strong
support for an important role of the VEGF autocrine loop induced by aberrant
hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling in human angiosarcoma, and further validate our
Tsc1iΔEC mice as a valuable model for this neoplasm.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We created an inducible EC-specific Tsc1 deletion mouse model and found that
hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in ECs is sufficient to induce and maintain growth of
vascular tumors that recapitulate salient features of human lymphangiosarcomas, including
local invasion and systemic metastasis through the lymphatics. Our Tsc1iΔEC mouse model
has a short tumor latency (3–4 months) and high penetrance (~100%) for tumor
development. We demonstrated the critical role of the VEGF signaling axis in tumor
development induced by HIF1α and c-Myc downstream from mTORC1. Blockade of VEGF
signaling decreased tumor cell proliferation, validating this model for discovery of
compounds to target important signaling molecules and pathways for lymphangiosarcoma.
Previous studies showed that some of either Tsc1+/− or Tsc2+/− mice developed vascular
tumors, implying a role for mTORC1 signaling (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002; Onda et al.,

1999). However, those mice were heterozygous for Tsc1 or Tsc2 in all cells and loss of the
remaining functional allele was not assessed in tumors. It was not clear whether mTORC1
activation in ECs or other cells such as smooth muscle cells, which could affect ECs through
cell-cell interactions or paracrine signaling, was responsible for vascular tumors. Increased
VEGF was observed in serum, but its cellular origin was unknown. The inducible Cre
employed in our mouse model is specific for ECs (Gothert et al., 2004). Our data establish
that hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in ECs is a driver for vascular tumor initiation.

PI3K/Akt signaling is a positive regulator for mTORC1 and has also been implicated in the
development of many tumor types (Foster and Fingar, 2010), although there is as yet no
direct report for its role in vascular tumors. In a mouse model with EC-specific
overexpression of constitutively active myrAkt1, sustained endothelial Akt activation
increased vascular permeability and pathological angiogenesis was reported, but not vascular
tumors. It was also unclear whether VEGF was increased in ECs with activated Akt (Phung
et al., 2006). If not, this might explain the lack of vascular tumor development in this mouse
model. We showed that mTORC1 activation following Tsc1 deletion led to decreased Akt
phosphorylation in ECs, consistent with previous studies indicating a feedback inhibitory
mechanism (Huang et al., 2008). Activation of the mTORC1/VEGF axis upon Tsc1 deletion,
independent of Akt, is sufficient to initiate the development and progression of vascular
tumors.

Previous studies have shown that hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling contributes to EC
transformation in mouse models of Kaposi’s sarcoma (Sodhi et al., 2006). Kaposi’s sarcoma
is a subtype of vascular tumor, but our studies describe a mouse model for the poorly studied
lymphangiosarcomas, with well-defined molecular changes in relevant cells, distinct from
Kaposi’s sarcoma in several important ways. Our mouse model recapitulates the invasion
and metastasis of human angiosarcoma; unlike Kaposi’s sarcoma mouse models. Many
human angiosarcomas and Kaposi’s sarcoma express lymphatic markers. Our model
recapitulates this important feature, unlike Kaposi’s sarcoma mouse models (Montaner et
al., 2003; Sodhi et al., 2006). Although mTOR activation and VEGFs are implicated in both
models, there are important differences in the mechanisms revealed. Akt and mTOR
signaling were activated and Akt plays a central role in sarcomagenesis in Kaposi’s sarcoma
models (Montaner et al., 2001; Sodhi et al., 2004). Our studies found the Akt pathway
repressed, and mTORC1 activation per se was sufficient to induce tumors. Only a small
fraction (less than 5%) of Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor cells expressed vGPCR, suggesting
paracrine mechanisms for VEGF (Montaner et al., 2003). In contrast, we found increased
mTOR activation and VEGF expression in essentially all tumor cells, suggesting an
autocrine VEGF mechanism in our mouse model.

While vascular anomalies in the liver showed positive blood EC markers only, the malignant
cutaneous tumors in Tsc1iΔEC mice were positive for both blood and lymphatic EC markers.
One explanation could be that liver anomalies develop from more differentiated blood ECs,
while cutaneous tumors form from early endothelial precursors exhibiting a mixture of both
markers. Alternatively, cutaneous lymphangiosarcomas could be developed from lymphatic
ECs in the adult mice. This explanation is supported by the fact that the earliest sign of
vascular abnormality in Tsc1iΔEC mice was lymphedema in the extremities, caused by

hyperplasia of lymphatic vessels in cutaneous tissues. Lymphatic hyperplasia and benign
malformations were prominent at early time points after Tsc1 deletion; malignant cutaneous
lymphangiosarcomas were more frequent at later time points. Therefore, our data favor the
possibility that early lymphatic vascular malformations can progress to cutaneous
lymphangiosarcomas. Similar progressions have been seen in some clinical observations
(Jeng et al., 2014; Quarmyne et al., 2012; Rossi and Fletcher, 2002).

The mechanistic insights from our model raise the immediate question of whether
rapamycin and anti-VEGF/VEGFR drugs will be effective for the treatment of human
vascular tumors. A recent Phase I trial showed that rapamycin is safe and potentially
effective for treating patients with vascular malformations and tumors. Interestingly, all
patients who responded well to rapamycin in this trial had vascular anomalies with
significant lymphatic components. (Hammill et al., 2011). The strong effect of rapamycin on
lymphatic-based lesions is consistent with our findings of the of cutaneous
lymphangiosarcoma development in Tsc1iΔEC mice as well as the requirement of mTORC1
for tumor maintenance. Several anti-VEGF/VEGFR drugs, including axitinib are in various
phases of clinical trial and some have already shown activity against angiosarcoma (Agulnik
et al., 2013; Ono et al., 2012). Inhibition of VEGFs by shRNA or axitinib significantly
reduced growth of vascular tumors derived from our Tsc1iΔEC mouse model. Treatment of
mouse vascular tumors with rapamycin plus axitinib did not provide benefit than rapamycin
alone, providing support that increased autocrine VEGF signaling is downstream of
mTORC1 hyperactivation.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our studies identify a critical role for the mTORC1/VEGF signaling axis in
lymphangiosarcoma development and maintenance, and establish the mouse model that
recapitulates many features of human lymphangiosarcoma including invasion and
metastasis. Our results provide significant insights into the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of this relatively rare but highly lethal cancer. The spontaneous and
heterogeneous nature of the vascular tumors in our mouse model also provides an
opportunity for further investigation into the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vascular
tumors as well as a powerful tool for testing therapeutic methods.

Experimental Procedures
Mice

Author Manuscript

Tsc1f/f and End-Scl-Cre-ERT mice were described previously (Gothert et al., 2004;
Kwiatkowski et al., 2002). Male and female mice with more than 98% C57BL/6
backgrounds were used. Age-and littermate-matched control and mutant mice were
randomly collected by genotype. Mice were housed and handled according to local, state,
and federal regulations. All experimental procedures were carried out according to protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of
Michigan and the University of Cincinnati. To induce Cre activity in newborn mice, three
consecutive IP tamoxifen injections (10 µl, 10 mg/ml in corn oil) (Sigma) were given on
postnatal day P1, P2, and P3. To induce Cre activity in adult mice, three consecutive IP
tamoxifen injections (100 µl, 10 mg/ml in corn oil) (Sigma) were given about 2 months after
birth. Control Tsc1f/f mice received the same tamoxifen treatment.

Mouse tumor transplantation

Author Manuscript

Vascular tumor cells were isolated from cutaneous tumors. 1.5 × 106 tumor cells were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice per site. Tumor volumes were measured two times
per week by caliper and calculated according to the following equation: 0.5 × [length ×
(width)2]. For rapamycin treatment, mice received 5 mg/kg rapamycin IP every other day.
For axitinib treatment, mice received 25 mg/kg orally daily. For shRNA experiments, cells
were infected by lentivirus (Sigma, VEGFA TRCN0000304451, VEGFC
TRCN0000328200, VEGFD TRCN0000425215, scramble SHC002) and selected by
puromycin.
Human tissues and histologic scoring

Author Manuscript

Human angiosarcoma tissue arrays were obtained from the Department of Pathology,
University of Michigan Medical School. Specimen collection and use of human tissue
samples were approved by the Medical School Institutional Review Board at the University
of Michigan, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The specimens were
stained with antibodies indicated. The intensity of staining was ranked into four groups (0–
3) according to histologic scoring. Scores 2 and 3 were designated positive; scores 1 and 0
were designated negative. Ki67 labeling index: “High” > 15% Ki67+ cells; “Low” < 15%
Ki67+ cells.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistical significance between 2 groups was evaluated by two-tailed Student's t-test.
Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank
test. Fisher's exact test was used to examine correlations between quantitative measurements.
p <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses used GraphPad Prism.
Further or detailed experimental procedures are described in the Supplemental Information.

Significance
Angiosarcoma/lymphangiosarcoma is a rare cancer that currently has no effective
treatment. The mechanism of angiosarcoma development is largely unknown, and there is
no animal model for the disease with molecularly defined pathogenesis. Here we describe
a mouse model with inducible mTORC1 activation exclusively in endothelial cells that
resulted in lymphangiosarcoma development and progression and recapitulated salient
features of human tumors including invasion and metastasis. We identified the VEGF
autocrine signaling loop as a critical event downstream of mTORC1 for vascular tumor
development and growth. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin or VEGF blockade
effectively abolished vascular tumor development and growth. This study provides
significant mechanistic insights and potential future therapies for a previously poorly
characterized but deadly cancer.
