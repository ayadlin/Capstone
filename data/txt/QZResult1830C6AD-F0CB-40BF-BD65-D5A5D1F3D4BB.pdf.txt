ABSTRACT
Suicide gene therapy using herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)
in combination with ganciclovir (GCV) has emerged as a potential new method for
treating cancer. We hypothesize that the efficacy of HSV-TK/GCV therapy is at least
partially dependent on p53 status in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Using
recombinant adenoviral vectors (rAdV), TK, p53, and ASPP2 were overexpressed
individually and in combination in Hep3B (p53 null) and HepG2 (p53 wild-type) cell
lines and in primary HCC tumor cells. p53 overexpression induced death in Hep3B
cells, but not HepG2 cells. ASPP2 overexpression increased rAdV-TK/GCV-induced
HepG2 cell death by interacting with endogenous p53. Similarly, ASPP2 reduced
survival in rAdV-TK/GCV-treated primary HCC cells expressing p53 wild-type but not
a p53 R249S mutant. Mutated p53 was unable to bind to ASPP2, suggesting that the
increase in rAdV-TK/GCV-induced cell death resulting from ASPP2 overexpression was
dependent on its interaction with p53. Additionally, γ-H2AX foci, ATM phosphorylation,
Bax, and p21 expression increased in rAdV-TK/GCV-treated HepG2 cells as compared
to Hep3B cells. This suggests that the combined use of HSV-TK, GCV, rAdV-p53 and
rAdV-ASPP2 may improve therapeutic efficacy in HCC patients lacking functional p53.

GCV into monophosphate GCV (GCV-MP). GCV-MP is
similar in structure to deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP),
and its insertion into DNA sequences during replication
inhibits DNA polymerase activity. The resulting singlestranded DNA breaks, leading to cell death [4]. Combined
HSV-TK and GCV treatment has been studied in a variety
of cancer types, including tumors of the brain, head and
neck, skin, lung, liver, pancreas, colon, prostate, ovary, and
breast. However, the results of several phase I and II clinical
trials showed only slightly prolonged survival times [5, 6],
possibly as a result of p53 mutation.
The p53 pathway mediates many cellular processes,
including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA
repair [7, 8]. p53 function can be disrupted by TP53 gene
mutations, alteration of upstream activating pathways, or
alterations in downstream components that mediate p53
activity [9]. Mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene

INTRODUCTION
Surgical resection remains the most effective
therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however,
less than 15% of patients benefit from this treatment due
to the presence of multiple tumor nodules. Other methods
used to treat HCC, including radiofrequency ablation
(RFA), microwave therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection
(PEIT), radiotherapy, and biological radiotherapy, also
have limited success. Gene therapy, including suicide
gene therapy using herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine
kinase (HSV-TK) in combination with the guanosine
analog ganciclovir (GCV), has emerged as a potential new
method for treating cancers.
The thymidine kinase (TK) gene product is involved
in drug sensitivity, and plays a key role in DNA synthesis.

have been reported in 23-67% of HCC patients worldwide
and in 50% of HCC patients in China and South Africa
[10–12].Most of these mutations were found in the DNA
binding region, which could prevent activation of target
gene expression. In these cases, p53-mediated cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis following HSV-TK/GCV-induced
DNA damage may not occur [13, 14].
Apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2 (ASPP2)
can promote cell apoptosis by enhancing binding of p53
to the promoters of the pro-apoptotic genes BAX and
PIG-3, upregulating their expression [15]. ASPP2 can
also activate the cell cycle regulation target gene p21 for
p53-mediated cell cycle inhibition. Compared to wild-type
mice, ASPP2 heterozygous knockout mice were more
susceptible to tumor formation [16]. Low levels of ASPP2
are correlated with poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma patients. Similarly, low ASPP2 expression is
associated with resistance to genotoxic damage in lung
cancer cell lines [17].
In the current study, two human liver cell lines
with either wild type or null p53 status, and four primary
HCC cell lines with either wild type or mutant p53, were
treated with a recombinant adenoviral vector carrying TK
in combination with the prodrugs GCV (rAdV-TK/GCV),
rAdV-p53, and rAdV-ASPP2, either individually or in
combination, in order to better understand the therapeutic
mechanisms of HSV-TK/GCV in HCC.

99.7% and 100.1%, at 0, 48, and 72 hours after infection,
respectively; these differences were not statistically
significant (p > 0.05) (Figure 2B). On the other hand,
survival rates of rAdV-p53-infected Hep3B cells decreased
from 91.3% to 57.9% and 27.7% at the same time points
(p < 0.01) (Figure 2B). Lentivirus-siRNA P53 was then
used to reduce endogenous p53 levels in HepG2 cells and
found that HepG2-p53 RNAi cells treated with rAdV-TK/
GCV alone exhibited more viability than HepG2-p53
RNAi cells treated with rAdV-p53 and rAdV-TK/GCV
(Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B). HepG2 and Hep3B
cells were then treated with rAdV-ASPP2 (1×107 copies/
ml); ASPP2 overexpression at 48 and 72 hours is shown
in Figure 2C. Survival rates of HepG2 cells were 107.5%,
99.7%, and 100.1%, and survival rates of Hep3B cells
were 107.5%, 99.7% and 100.1% (p > 0.05) at 0, 48, and
72 hours after rAdV-ASPP2 infection, respectively (Figure
2D). Overexpression of ASPP2 alone, via rAdV-ASPP2
infection, did not impact cell viability.

Overexpression of p53, but not ASPP2, increases
rAdV-TK/GCV-induced death in Hep3B cells
Because rAdV-TK/GCV treatment failed to induce
Hep3B cell death, we co-infected Hep3B cells with
rAdV-p53 and rAdV-TK/GCV to determine whether
p53 restoration altered the effect of rAdV-TK/GCV on
cell death. In addition, we co-infected Hep3B lines with
rAdV-p53, rAdV-ASPP2, and rAdV-TK/GCV for 72
hours. Expression of p53, ASPP2, and TK was confirmed
by Western blotting (Figure 3A). HepB3 cell viability
was analyzed using the MTT cell proliferation assay
over four days. At four days, cell viability of the triple
co-infected Hep3B cells was 31%; however, the survival
rate for rAdV-ASPP2 and rAdV-TK/GCV co-infected
Hep3B cells was 101% (Figure 3B). Apoptosis rates were
27% in rAdV-p53 and rAdV-TK/GCV co-infected lines
and 5% in rAdV-ASPP2 and rAdV-TK/GCV co-infected
cells (Figure 3C). These results suggest that p53, but not
ASPP2, increases rAdV-TK/GCV cytotoxicity in the p53null Hep3B cell line.

RESULTS
rAdV-TK/GCV treatment induces death in
HepG2 cells but not in Hep3B cells
We used the p53 null cell line, Hep3B, and the wildtype p53 cell line, HepG2, to study the effects of p53 status
on rAdV-TK/GCV therapy in HCC. Treatment with rAdVTK/GCV increased TK levels in both HepG2 and Hep3B
cells, and p53 levels in HepG2 cells, over 48 hours (Figure
1A). Cell viability in both lines was unchanged after five
days of treatment with either rAdV-TK or GCV alone
(Figure 1B and 1C). Combined treatment with rAdV-TK
and GCV led to a rapid decline in cell viability in HepG2
cells (Figure 1B), but not in Hep3B cells (Figure 1C),
over the five-day treatment period. Treatment with both
rAdV-TK and GCV also increased apoptosis in HepG2
cells more than rAdV-TK (p < 0.01) or GCV (p < 0.01)
treatment alone. No difference in apoptosis was observed
in Hep3B lines (p > 0.05).

rAdV-TK/GCV induces endogenous p53
expression via phosphorylation of ATM and
γ-H2AX
We found that rAdV-TK/GCV treatment induced
HepG2 cell cycle arrest (Supplementary Figure S3) and
apoptosis (Figure 1 and 3); exogenous overexpression of
p53 via rAdV-p53 infection did not change this effect.
Western blot results showed that p53 levels were higher
in HepG2 cells treated with rAdV-TK/GCV for 48 hours,
but ASPP2 levels were not affected in either HepG2
or Hep3B cells (Figure 4A). Further testing showed
that p53-upregulated p21 and Bax levels in HepG2
cells were higher following rAdV-TK/GCV treatment

Overexpression of p53, but not ASPP2, causes
death in Hep3B cells
HepG2 and Hep3B cells were infected with
rAdV-p53 at 1×107 copies/ml for 48 and 72 hours, and
overexpression of p53 was confirmed by Western blotting
(Figure 2A). The viabilities of HepG2 cells were 107.5%,

for 48 hours. However, p21 and Bax expression in
Hep3B cells did not change under the same conditions
(Figure 4B and 4C).
More γ-H2AX foci were detected in HepG2
cells following rAdV-TK/GCV treatment (Figure 4B).
Additionally, ATM phosphorylation levels increased in
both HepG2 and Hep3B cells following treatment (Figure
4C). Following RNAi inhibition of ATM, p53 and its
target genes were downregulated in HepG2 cells (Figure
4D). These results suggest that p53 plays an important role
in apoptosis induced by rAdV-TK/GCV, and endogenous
p53 upregulation following treatment results in part from
increased ATM expression and phosphorylation.

5B). The Hep3B survival rates detected by MTT assay
were 73% with rAdV-p53 and rAdV-TK/GCV, and 45%
following rAdV-p53, rAdV-ASPP2 and rAdV-TK/GCV
co-infection.
ASPP2 overexpression also increased p21 and Bax
expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas
GCV alone or rAdV-TK/GCV alone did not (Figure 5C
and 5D).

ASPP2 and p53 overexpression can enhance the
therapeutic effect of rAdV-TK/GCV in primary
HCC cultures
Most HCC-associated p53 mutations have been
reported at p53 R249S. The p53 statuses of four fresh liver
tissue samples excised from individual HCC patients at
Beijing Youan Hospital were examined by PCR and DNA
sequencing. Two cases included the p53 R249S mutation
(cases 2 and 3), and two cases had wild-type p53 (cases
1 and 4) (Figure 6A). Primary tumor cells cultivated to
the sixth generation were treated with rAdV-ASPP2 and
rAdV-TK/GCV. rAdV-ASPP2 reduced survival of rAdVTK/GCV-treated p53 wild-type primary HCC cells, but not
of p53 R249S cells (Figure 6B). p53 knockdown primary
wild-type p53 HCC cells had higher viability than parental

p53 combined with ASPP2 promotes rAdV-TK/
GCV-induced death in Hep3B cells
To study the effects of ASPP2 and p53 cooverexpression on p53-null HCC cells, Hep3B cells were
co-infected with rAdV-ASPP2, rAdV-P53, and rAdVTK/GCV. Compared to rAdV-p53 infection alone, coinfected cells exhibited increased cell death as detected
by MTT assay. Early apoptosis detection with AnnexinV
showed that ASPP2 overexpression increased rAdV-p53
and rAdV-TK/GCV-induced cell death (Figure 5A and

primary HCC cells (case 1 and 4) , when they treated with
rAdV-ASPP2, and rAdV-TK/GCV (Supplementary Figure
S2A and S2B). At the same time, only P53 R249S mutated
primary HCC cells (case 2 and 3) were showed low cell
viability after treatment with rAdV-TK/GCV, rAdV-P53
and rAdV-ASPP2 (Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D).
These results further confirmed that endogenous P53
plays an important role in rAdV-p53, rAdV-ASPP2, and
rAdV-TK/GCV-induced primary HCC death. Levels of
the p53 target genes p21 and Bax were then measured in
HCC cells. p21 and Bax levels increased in rAdV-ASPP2
and rAdV-TK/GCV-treated wild type p53 primary HCC
cultures, but not in p53 R249S cells (Figure 6C). p53
overexpression in HepG2 cells, which have wild-type p53,
did not affect cell death (Figure 2B); we further tested this

effect in the p53 wild-type primary hepatocarcinoma cells
(cases 1 and 4). No change in cell death was detected in
the primary hepatocarcinoma cells following rAdV-P53
infection (Figure 6D). Co-immunoprecipitation results
showed that ASPP2 can interact with rAdV-TK/GCVinduced p53, but ASPP2 failed to bind in cells with
mutated p53 or in the absence of rAdV-TK/GCV treatment
(Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure S2E).

DISCUSSION
Suicide gene therapy using the HSV-TK/GCV system
is a well-characterized tool used in cancer therapy [18–23].
However, this treatment has demonstrated little efficacy in
HCC cases in clinical practice, mostly due to low targeting

and absence of the ‘bystander effect’. One reason for this
low efficacy could be the high incidence of p53 mutation
in HCC, which is also associated with poor HCC prognosis
[24]. Our HSV-TK/GCV phase III clinical trial found that
some patients have good outcomes, but other patients are
not sensitive to the treatment. The results from the current
study support the hypothesis that the effect of HSV-TK/
GCV on HCC cells is closely related to p53 status.
In the present study, we evaluated whether gene
therapy with rAdV-ASPP2, rAdV-p53, and rAdV-TK/GCV
is more effective than gene therapy with rAdV-TK/GCV
alone for the induction of tumor death with and without
functional p53. First, we found that rAdV-TK/GCV-treated
p53 wild-type cells (HepG2) rapidly declined in number as
a result of the treatment, whereas p53 null cells (Hep3B)
were unaffected (Figure 1B and 1C). This strongly suggests

that the effect of rAdV-TK/GCV treatment was closely
related to p53 status in HCC cells. rAdV-p53 can effectively
reduce Hep3B, but not HepG2, cell viability, and rAdVASPP2 alone had no impact on either cell line. However,
reduced Hep3B survival following rAdV-TK/GCV treatment
depended on both ASPP2 and endogenous p53 activity
(Figure 5). Thus, our study implicates p53 in rAdV-TK/GCVinduced cell death, which is enhanced by ASPP2. rAdV-TK/
GCV-induced death in HepG2 cells (with wild-type p53)
was not enhanced by p53 overexpression, suggesting that the
combination of HSV-TK/GCV and rAdV-p53 would benefit
only those patients whose tumors do not express functional
p53. Our results also showed that both γ-H2AX foci levels
and ATM phosphorylation levels, which induced p53 and
p53 target genes Bax and p21, were higher in HSV-TK/GCVtreated HepG2 cells than in Hep3B cells (Figure 4).

The comet assay and γ-H2AX foci experiments
by Ladd et al. have shown that HSV-TK/GCV can
cause DNA double-stranded breaks [25], which are
frequently irreversible and result in cell death [7].
Such DNA damage can increase levels of ATM (ataxia
telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related),
both of which induce phosphorylation of serine 15 on
p53; this prevents the interaction of MDM2 with p53
and reduces p53 ubiquitination and degradation [26,
27]. Previous studies also demonstrated that GCV
administration increased γ-H2AX induction in a dosedependent manner, and this increase was also p53dependent. However, studies have shown that nearly
half of HCC patients harbor p53 mutations [28].

In HBV-related HCC, the most common p53
mutation occurs at amino acid 249 (R249S). To further
confirm the relationship between p53 mutation status
and clinical outcomes of HSV-TK/GCV therapy, we
treated cultured primary HCC cells with and without p53
mutations with HSV-TK/GCV and rAdV-ASPP2. The
treatment only had an effect on primary HCC cells with
wild type p53. Furthermore, mutated p53 was unable to
bind with ASPP2, which confirmed that the pro-apoptotic
function of HSV-TK/GCV treatment is dependent on the
interaction between ASPP2 and p53. Our found supported
that the combined use of HSV-TK, GCV, rAdV-p53 and
rAdV-ASPP2 may improve therapeutic efficacy in HCC
patients lacking functional p53.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CTAACTTGTGAGCCC (reverse); for β-actin: 5’GCCCTGAGGCACTCTTCCA-3’ (forward) and 5’CGGATGTCCACGTCACACTT-3’ (reverse).

Cell culture and treatment
The human HepG2 and Hep3B hepatoblastoma
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells seeded on glass
cover slips were used for immunofluorescence assays.
Human primary hepatoma cells (PHCs) were isolated
from specimens obtained from patients undergoing
hepatic resections. The specimens used in this study were
obtained for pathological examination and isolation of
DNA for PCR. The PCR products were extracted and
sequenced by Biomed, Inc. (Beijing, China); therefore,
there was no need for the patient to sign an informed
consent form. PHCs were isolated from prewashed HCC
tissues using a two-step collagenase perfusion and were
cultivated within two layers of rat-tail collagen. All cells
were seeded in 6- or 24-well plates for rAdV infection
and GCV treatment.

Western blotting

Recombinant adenoviral vectors and lentinvirus

Flow cytometric analysis was performed using
BD FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson). HepG2 and
Hep3B cells were plated 24 hours prior to transfection
with rAdV-TK, rAdV-ASPP2, rAdV-P53, or rAdV-GFP
at a concentration of 1x107 PFU/ml (in rAdV-ASPP2
and rAdV-P53 co-treatment groups [Figure 5], the
concentration of rAdV-P53 was 2.5x106 PFU/ml). After
treatment with GCV at different time points, the cells were
washed twice with cold PBS, re-suspended in Annexin V
binding buffer (SouthernBiotech), and analyzed by flow
cytometry.

Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot as
previously described [15]. Briefly, total lysates were
separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF filters. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk,
the membranes were probed with primary antibodies
(Monoclonal antibodies: Anti-P53 DO-1 from
NeoMarkers, Anti-ASPP2 C-terminal DX 54.10 from
Sigma, and all others, including Tubulin, Bax, P21,
ATM, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies, from Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The blots
were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (Pierce SuperSignal, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.
Rockford, IL, USA) and were exposed onto X-ray films.

Cell apoptosis assay

A recombinant replication-defective adenoviral
vector (CE1A deleted) containing the HSV-TK gene
(rAdV-TK) under the transcriptional control of the Rous
sarcoma virus long terminal repeat was used for gene
delivery. It was produced at Cancer Research Center,
Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, following
protocols detailed elsewhere [11, 12, 29]. Viral particles
(vp/ml) were determined by spectrophotometric absorption
and the purified adenovirus (5×1011 vp/ml) was stored in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% glycerol
at -80°C. Before injection, adenovirus was diluted to the
dose specified for each experimental group. rAdV-p53
(1×1012 vp/ml) was gifted from Saibainuo Biotech. Inc.,
Shenzheng, China. GCV (0.25 g/ml) was purchased from
Sigma. rAdV-ASPP2 (5×1011 vp/ml) was produced by our
lab and was stored at -20°C. The lentinvirus-P53 RNAi
(1×108 vp/ml) was ordered from Heyuan BioTech. Inc.,
Shanghai, China.

Cell viability assay (MTT method)
The supernatants were collected to assess cell
viability using the Vybrant MTT cell Proliferation
Assay Kit from Life Technologies (Invitrogen Life
Technologies). Briefly, 20 μl of MTT solution were added
to each well and thoroughly mixed into the media. The
cells were then continually incubated (37°C, 5% CO2) for
3 hours to allow the MTT to be metabolized. Finally, after
cells were removed from the media and dissolved with 200
μl DMSO, cell viability was detected by reading optical
density at 560 nm and subtracting background at 670 nm.

Quantitative RT-PCR assay
An RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
was used to isolate the total RNA from cultured cells
with or without treatments. The SuperScript III System
for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to
synthesize first-strand cDNA. SyBR Green was added
for the detection of dsDNA products during RT-PCR.
Relative mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin. The
primers for real time quantitative PCR were as follows:
for p21: 5’-CAGGCTGAAGGGTCCCCAGGTGGA-3’
(forward) and 5’- GGATTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGA-3’
(reverse); for Bax: GGGCTCACAAGTTAGAGA
CAAGCCTGGGCG (forward) and CGCCCAGGCTTGTCT

Analysis of γ-H2AX foci formation by fluorescence
microscopy
Cells were grown on chambered slides for 48 hours
prior to rAdV-TK/GCV infection. After incubation with
rAdV-TK/GCV, the cells were washed with PBS and then
fixed and permeabilized with acetone:methanol (50:50
v/v) for 10 min. The fixed cells were then washed with
PBS, blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 hour, incubated
with γ-H2AX primary antibody (1:500 dilution; Novus

NB-100-3B4) for 1 hour, washed, incubated with FITC
conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:300
dilution; Jackson Immunology Research, USA) for 1 hour,
washed, and mounted with DAPI (Vector, USA). Images
of representative cell populations were captured, and
γ-H2AX foci were counted visually.

Co-immunoprecipitation assay (CO-IP)
CO-IP was performed as described previously [15].
Briefly, cell lysates (500 μg of protein in 500 μl of RIPA
lysis buffer) were pre-cleared using protein A/G PLUSagarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were
incubated at 4°C overnight with anti-ASPP2 antibody.
The immunocomplexes were separated by incubation with

Cells were harvested and re-suspended in PBS buffer
at 1-2 x 106 cells/ml in a 15 ml polypropylene, V-bottomed
tube. Cells were then fixed with cold 100% ethanol for
1 hour at 4°C. After two PBS washes, the cells were resuspended in PI staining solution (20 μg/ml propidium
iodide, 0.5 μg/ml RNase A in PBS) for 3 hr at 4°C. The
samples were stored at 4°C until analysis by flow cytometry
