SUMMARY

Mutation is a fundamental process in tumorigenesis.
However, the degree to which the rate of somatic
mutation varies across the human genome and the
mechanistic basis underlying this variation remain
to be fully elucidated. Here, we performed a crosscancer comparison of 402 whole genomes comprising a diverse set of childhood and adult tumors,
including both solid and hematopoietic malignancies. Surprisingly, we found that the inactive
X chromosome of many female cancer genomes
accumulates on average twice and up to four
times as many somatic mutations per megabase,

as compared to the individual autosomes. Wholegenome sequencing of clonally expanded hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy
individuals and a premalignant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) sample revealed no X chromosome
hypermutation. Our data suggest that hypermutation
of the inactive X chromosome is an early and frequent feature of tumorigenesis resulting from DNA
replication stress in aberrantly proliferating cells.
INTRODUCTION
The process of somatic mutation is fundamental to cancer development. A number of causes for these mutations have been

described, including intrinsic mutation processes such as damage from endogenous reactive oxygen species or incomplete
fidelity of the DNA replication machinery and extrinsic factors
such as environmental and lifestyle exposures. For example,
UV light and tobacco exposure are both well-known factors adding to the mutational burden of somatic cells (Stratton et al.,
2009).
Human germline mutation rates are not constant across the
genome, varying with factors such as base composition and
transcription levels (Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011; Ellegren et al., 2003). It is also known that the X chromosome typically
shows reduced variation compared with the autosomes (Malcom et al., 2003). Only recently, however, have some studies
elucidated the existence of variation in genome-wide somatic
mutation rates and potential causes thereof. The mutation rate
varies within a cancer genome according to underlying genomic
features such as GC content, CpG islands, and recombination
rate (Greenman et al., 2007). Regions that are actively transcribed have mutation rates at least 25% lower than nontranscribed regions (Chapman et al., 2011) due to mechanisms of
transcription-coupled repair. Chromatin organization, specifically the level of heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3, has been reported to account for more than 40%
of mutation-rate variation (Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012).
Late-replicating regions also have a higher mutation rate than
early-replicating regions in cancer as well as in the germline
(Liu et al., 2013; Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009).
The inactive X chromosome (Xi) is one of the latest replicating
regions of the human genome, being replicated distinctly later in
S phase than the autosomes and its active X counterpart (Xa;
Hansen et al., 1996; Morishima et al., 1962). In contrast to the
autosomes, for which two active copies are present, both male
and female cells carry only one active X chromosome. In mammals, dosage compensation between male and female cells is
achieved by inactivating one of the two female X chromosomes
(Chow and Heard, 2009; Lyon, 1961). This results in transcriptional silencing of most of the 1,500 genes located on the
human X chromosome, although about 3%–15% of genes are
known to escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI), depending
on cell type (Carrel and Willard, 2005). XCI is initiated very early
in embryonic stem cell differentiation and is characterized by a
stochastic choice of the X chromosome subjected to inactivation
(Barakat and Gribnau, 2012). The chosen inactivated copy (Xi) is
then stably maintained through all subsequent cell divisions. The
transcription of X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST) RNA, a 17 kb
spliced and polyadenylated RNA with no coding capacity, is
monoallelically upregulated at the onset of XCI and associates
with the future Xi in cis (Brown et al., 1992). This XIST coating
of the Xi provides the template for a series of histone modifications, including histone-H3 lysine 9 and 27 methylation and
histone-H4 deacetylation and macroH2A accumulation, ultimately leading to heterochromatin formation (Plath et al.,
2002). After XCI, XIST is expressed continuously and exclusively
from the inactive copy of the X chromosome.
In this study, we performed a cross-cancer analysis based on
402 whole-cancer genomes, including our own published and
new cancer genome data sets from six different entities (medulloblastoma [Jones et al., 2012; M.K., D.T.W.J., N.J., P.A.N.,

M.D.T., R.E., S.M.P., and P.L., unpublished data], pilocytic
astrocytoma [Jones et al., 2013], glioblastoma [S.M.P., M.K.,
D.T.W.J, P.A.N., M.D.T., R.E., P.L., and A.K., unpublished
data], ependymoma [S.C.M., H.W., P.A.N., D.T.W.J., N.J.,
S.M.P., and M.D.T., unpublished data], B cell lymphoma [Richter
et al., 2012; M.S., J.R., M.H., P.L., R.E., and R.S., unpublished
data], and prostate carcinoma [Weischenfeldt et al., 2013]), in
addition to published mutation call sets of six different cancer
types: breast cancer (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012), neuroblastoma
(Molenaar et al., 2012), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL,
Puente et al., 2011), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, Welch
et al., 2012), colorectal carcinoma (Bass et al., 2011), and retinoblastoma (Zhang et al., 2012).
In many female cancer genomes, we unexpectedly found
hypermutation of the X chromosome—i.e., a clearly elevated
density of mutations compared with the individual autosomes.
We show that this hypermutation of the X chromosome is
confined to the inactive X chromosome and involves singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as small insertions and deletions (indels), which both show a marked increase in mutations
along the X chromosome. Whole-genome sequencing of three
independent clonal expansions of healthy hematopoietic stem/
progenitor cells and one sample from myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), which, although clonal, is considered a premalignant
condition, revealed no X chromosome hypermutation. Thus,
X chromosome hypermutation is a common feature of female
cancer genomes occurring across a wide range of tumor types.
RESULTS
The X Chromosome Accumulates Significantly More
Mutations Than Autosomes in Medulloblastoma
Genomes from Female Samples
We analyzed the genome-wide distribution of somatic SNVs in
113 primary medulloblastoma samples collected within the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor
Project. The tumors, together with matched normal DNAs,
were sequenced to average 30- to 40-fold coverage (Jones
et al., 2012; M.K., D.T.W.J., N.J., P.A.N., M.D.T., R.E., S.M.P.,
and P.L., unpublished data; Table S1 available online). To
analyze the distribution of mutations in the genome, the intermutation distance (the distance between a given somatic SNV and
the SNV immediately upstream) was plotted for each sample.
The mutational patterns revealed by this analysis are outlined
below using an exemplary female and male genome (Figures
1A and 1B), which both belong to the same tumor subgroup
(Sonic Hedgehog pathway-activated medulloblastoma).
A lower mean intermutation distance on the X chromosome
(0.33 Mb) compared with the autosomes (1.2 Mb) was observed
in the female sample (Figure 1A), corresponding to a much higher
number of mutations on the X chromosome than on any of the individual autosomes. In most cases, the X chromosome harbored
a higher number of SNVs than both chromosomes 1 and 2 combined (e.g., MB56 in Figure 1A), even though each of them is
much larger in size than the X chromosome. Further, MB56
has a total of 2,887 somatic SNVs in its genome, 469 (16%) of
which are located on the X chromosome (Figure 1A). Given the
size of the X chromosome, which at 155 megabases is very

Figure 1. Distribution of Somatic Mutations in Medulloblastoma Genomes of Female versus Male Samples
(A) Intermutation distance plot of medulloblastoma MB56 (female). Mutations are ordered on the x axis from the first variant on the short arm of chromosome 1 to
the last variant on the long arm of chromosome X. The distance between each somatic SNV and the SNV immediately upstream (the intermutation distance) is
plotted on the y axis on a log scale. The chromosomes are separated by thin lines; chromosome X mutations are colored in gray. See also Figure S1.
(B) Intermutation distance plot for medulloblastoma MB61 (male).
(C) To present mutational load per chromosome corrected for the size of the respective chromosome, the mutation rate per megabase was plotted for female
MB56. Coloring of bars represents the ratio of the six possible nucleotide changes (C > A, C > G, C > T, T > A, T > C, and T > G) for each chromosome.
(D) Mutational load per chromosome for MB61.

similar in size to chromosome 7, only about 5% of SNVs would
be expected to occur on the X chromosome by chance, as is
the case for chromosome 7 (n = 145 SNVs, 5.0%). In the male
genome, no such difference in mutation rate between the X chromosome and the autosomes was observed (Figure 1B). Both
exemplary tumor genomes are diploid, with no copy number or
structural variations except for partial 10q loss in the female
sample (Figure S1). Therefore, copy number changes of the
chromosomes do not explain the large difference of SNVs on
the X chromosome.
To present mutational load per chromosome corrected for the
size of the respective chromosome, the mutation rate per
megabase was plotted (Figures 1C and 1D). Coloring of bars
represents the proportions of the six possible nucleotide
changes (C > A, C > G, C > T, T > A, T > C, and T > G) for
each chromosome. This presentation of the chromosomal distribution of SNVs shows that the X chromosome accumulated 3.6fold more somatic mutations per megabase compared to the
mean of all autosomes in sample MB56 (Figure 1C). If the number
of mutations per megabase on X is at least twice that of the mean

mutation rate of the autosomes, we use the term ‘‘X chromosome hypermutation.’’ The majority of medulloblastoma cancer
genomes of female patients (20/25, 80%) showed X chromosome hypermutation (Figure 2A).
The expected number of SNVs depends on the copy
number state of each chromosome. Thus, copy number
changes of each chromosome have to be considered as
confounding variables when comparing number of somatic
SNVs per chromosome. To correct for copy number state
of the autosomes, we considered only diploid medulloblastoma genomes with at most six copy number aberrant
chromosomes and excluded the respective chromosomes per
case; 49/113 cases fulfilled these criteria (Figure 2A). For all
remaining cases, we can only infer X hypermutation to be
present or not—we cannot accurately estimate the strength
of X hypermutation.
In general, male medulloblastoma genomes do not show
X chromosome hypermutation (Figures 1D and 2A). Male
genomes have only one copy of X in the germline; therefore,
the amount of mutations on the X chromosome needs to be

doubled in order to correct for copy number status. Even after
correcting the mutation rate of the X chromosome in males,
the difference between female versus male X chromosome
mutation rate is highly significant in medulloblastoma (p = 8 3
1011, t test) and in three other tumor types (Figures 2D–2G).
We note that, after this correction, a few male samples enter
the range of our definition of X chromosome hypermutation (Figure 2A). This might be explained by the fact that hemizygous
mutations on the single X chromosome in males can be more
readily called by mutation calling algorithms than heterozygous
mutations in female samples, which will typically be supported
by fewer reads. However, the ratio of X chromosome versus
autosome mutation rate in males and in females with X chromosome loss ranges from about 0.5 to 1, or 1- to 2-fold after
correcting for the single copy of X, whereas we observe a range
of 2- to 4-fold higher mutation rates when both Xa and Xi are
present. This suggests that Xi accumulates at least twice as
many mutations as Xa.
Note that the variation in strength of X chromosome hypermutation observed in the medulloblastoma female samples (Figure 2A) does not correlate with age at diagnosis (Figure 2B),
which is in contrast to the finding that the overall number of
somatic mutations in medulloblastoma strongly correlates with
age (Jones et al., 2012).

X Hypermutation Is Confined to the Inactive
X Chromosome
Most, but not all, medulloblastoma genomes from female
patients display X chromosome hypermutation (Tables 1 and
S1 and Figure 2A). We therefore further examined those cases
not displaying this phenomenon. First, medulloblastoma genomes from females with loss of an X chromosome in the tumor
(resulting in only one copy of the X chromosome) do not show
X chromosome hypermutation (Figure 2A; for example, MB18).
However, it is not the X copy number state in itself that determines X hypermutation. Tetraploid female sample MB6 has
two copies of the X chromosome but has loss of heterozygosity
and no XIST expression (Figure S2). Indeed, all medulloblastoma
genomes from female samples that lost one copy of the X chromosome also show no XIST expression, indicating that Xa is kept
and Xi is lost (Figure 2C). We did not observe X chromosome
hypermutation in MB6 (with two copies of Xa; Figure S2B) and
consistently found no X hypermutation in cases that lost Xi,
regardless of the absolute copy number state of X. Further,
X hypermutation is not present in male tetraploid genomes
with more than one copy of the X chromosome. These analyses
indicate that the copy number state of the X chromosome
does not impact X hypermutation but rather indicates that it
depends on the presence of Xi. Remarkably, a medulloblastoma
Cell 155, 567–581, October 24, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc. 571

from a male patient (MB139) with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY
genome) also shows a trend toward X chromosome hypermutation (Figure 2A). The matching RNA data confirm XIST expression and therefore presence of Xi (Figure 2C).
To further study the confinement of hypermutation to Xi, we
performed two different approaches. First, for two samples
(MB101 and lymphoma 4120193) with high mutational load
and imbalanced copy number states of Xi versus Xa, we
assigned individual SNVs to the active/inactive X chromosome
by in silico haplotype phasing of mutations. Second, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)
for histone marks H3K36me3 and histone variant macroH2A1
in order to haplotype the X chromosome of two additional samples (MB59 and GBM103).
For haplotype phasing, we attempted to phase mutations that
are sufficiently close together to be spanned by single read pairs.
The first 52 megabases of chromosome arm Xp in female sample
MB101 are present at three copies in the tumor. RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq)-based allele frequencies of germline variants clearly
identify Xi being present with two copies and Xa with a single
copy. In total, 222 somatic SNVs were called in this region.
Many somatic mutations were sufficiently close to heterozygous
germline SNPs that individual sequence read pairs spanned
both, thus allowing the mutation to be phased with the SNP.
Here, a germline SNP with an allele frequency of about 1/3 indicates that this mutation is on Xa, whereas an allele frequency of
2/3 indicates that this mutation is located on Xi. In total, 58
somatic SNVs were haplotyped by this approach, of which 46
unambiguously mapped to Xi and 12 to Xa (p < 0.0001, permutation test). Even when doubling the amount of Xa mutations in
order to correct for the single copy state of Xa in MB101, the
difference is still significant (24 Xa versus 46 Xi mutations;
p = 0.006).
The same haplotyping approach was applied to X chromosome hypermutated lymphoma sample 4120193 (female), for
which most of the Xq arm is present at three copies in the tumor
(Figure 3). Here, RNA-seq-based allele frequencies of germline
variants indicate that Xi has two copies and Xa has a single
copy. The sample has a high genome-wide mutational load
with 3,756 somatic SNVs on the X chromosome alone. Of those
SNVs, 444 were haplotyped, of which 389/444 SNVs unambiguously mapped to Xi and 55/444 mapped to Xa (p < 0.0001, permutation test). Doubling the amount of Xa mutations (n = 110)
in order to correct for the single copy state of Xa still results in
3.53 more mutations on Xi. Interestingly, this sample also
shows focal regions of higher intermutation distance on the
X chromosome (Figure 3A), corresponding to lower mutation
rates. These regions with fewer mutations harbor genes
escaping X inactivation, as well as the pseudoautosomal regions PAR1 and PAR2 (Figure 3B). In addition, we compared
medulloblastoma female samples with X hypermutation
(n = 10) with male samples (n = 10) of the same tumor subtype
and ploidy and found that regions escaping X chromosome
inactivation have a mean mutation rate of 1/Mb in both male
and female samples. Thus, regions escaping X chromosome
inactivation are not X hypermutated, further supporting our
finding that X hypermutation is confined to heterochromatic
regions of the inactive X chromosome.
572 Cell 155, 567–581, October 24, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.

To haplotype the X chromosome of two additional samples
(MB59 and GBM103), we performed ChIP-seq for histone marks
H3K36me3 and macroH2A1. Histone variant macroH2A1 is
known to show an 1.5-fold uniform enrichment along the inactive X chromosome (Mietton et al., 2009). In contrast, H3K36me3
is enriched in actively transcribed regions and therefore on Xa.
Thus, by sequencing both histone marks to sufficiently high
depth to infer allele frequencies of mutations, a mutation on Xi
should have a high allele frequency in the macroH2A1 reads
and a low allele frequency in H3K36me3, which we clearly
observed for the germline mutations (data not shown). Integrating matching RNA-seq data with mutations showing particularly high/low macroH2A1/H3K36me3 allele frequencies
(Extended Experimental Procedures), 31 SNVs were haplotyped
in glioblastoma GBM103, with only 3 SNVs locating to Xa (p <
0.0001, permutation test). In medulloblastoma MB59, eight
SNVs were haplotyped, of which only two mapped to Xa.
Most X hypermutated samples have no RNA-seq read support
at mutated positions because these mutations localize mainly to
intergenic regions. However, a pool of 16 medulloblastoma samples had in total 22 somatic SNVs sufficiently covered in the
patient-matched RNA sequencing data (excluding genes that
escape X inactivation). Of these 22 mutations, 21/22 mutations
were not present in the RNA despite sufficient RNA coverage
at the mutated position and are therefore likely to be present
on the inactive X (p < 0.0001, permutation test).
X chromosome hypermutation was observed in all medulloblastoma samples of female patients in which the inactive
X chromosome was present, and haplotyping of four individual
samples clearly indicates that X hypermutation is confined to
the inactive X chromosome.
X Chromosome Hypermutation Is a Feature of Many
Different Cancer Types
To assess whether X chromosome hypermutation is a general
feature of multiple tumor types, we analyzed the somatic mutation rate of the X chromosome in an additional 300 wholecancer genomes, including our own published and unpublished
data from five different cancer entities (pilocytic astrocytoma,
glioblastoma, ependymoma, B cell lymphoma, and prostate carcinoma) complemented by published mutation call sets of six
different cancer types: breast cancer (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012),
neuroblastoma (Molenaar et al., 2012), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Puente et al., 2011), acute myeloid leukemia (Welch et al.,
2012), colorectal carcinoma (Bass et al., 2011), and retinoblastoma (Zhang et al., 2012). We observed X chromosome hypermutation in a significant fraction of cancer genomes from female
samples (56/191, 29%) comprising nine different cancer entities
across a diverse set of childhood tumors as well as adult solid
and hematopoietic malignancies (Tables 1 and S1 and Figure 4).
In contrast to medulloblastoma, not every female cancer
genome containing Xi in the other cancer types displays X hypermutation, as far as information about Xi status was available. In
the two female cases of CLL, no X hypermutation was detected.
This was also the case for the six female samples of colorectal
carcinoma by the strict definition given above, but in two
genomes of female samples, the X chromosome showed the
highest mutation rate of all chromosomes. If we include all

female cases of the different cancer types with an increased
mutation rate, but not X chromosome hypermutation by our
strict definition, then 83/191 (43%) females are affected. Some
of the cancer genomes had extremely low amounts of somatic
mutations (<200 SNVs), specifically in the pediatric tumors
pilocytic astrocytoma and neuroblastoma (Table S1), which

makes detection of X chromosome hypermutation impossible
for a single sample.
Interestingly, a breast cancer genome with about 10,000
mutations showed clear X chromosome hypermutation, as did
a retinoblastoma genome of a 21-month-old patient with only
258 mutations (Figures 4A and 4B). Thus, the occurrence of

Figure 4. X Chromosome Hypermutation Is a Feature of Many Different Cancer Types
Mutations per chromosome plot for exemplary genomes from female samples of (A) breast cancer, (B) retinoblastoma, (C) B cell lymphoma, (D) neuroblastoma,
(E) glioblastoma, and (F) AML. See also Figure S3.

X chromosome hypermutation cannot simply be explained by
the total number of somatic mutations or by age at diagnosis.
Some cancer genomes from females with a very high number
of somatic mutations, like some of the breast cancer (Nik-Zainal
574 Cell 155, 567–581, October 24, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.

et al., 2012) and colorectal adenocarcinoma genomes (Bass
et al., 2011), do not show X hypermutation. It may be that,
in some tumors, local hypermutation due to processes such
as kataegis (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012) might mask the general

accumulation of mutations on Xi. We also observed X chromosome hypermutation in a recurrence of medulloblastoma MB34
(Jones et al., 2012), with the same degree of hypermutation as
in the primary tumor despite a higher number of mutations
genome wide (data not shown).
Our analyses thus indicate that X chromosome hypermutation
is present in many diverse types of cancer genomes from female
patients but to varying degrees within each cancer type in terms
of strength of X hypermutation and number of affected samples.
Characteristics of X Chromosome Hypermutation in
Medulloblastoma
Next, we examined whether X chromosome hypermutation is an
early or late event in tumorigenesis. Because tetraploidy is
known to be a frequent early event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis (Jones et al., 2012), we assessed whether X hypermutation is already present before tetraploidy occurs. For this
analysis, we considered only mutations with a clear 50% allele
frequency because allele frequencies of 25% indicate a mutation on only one of the four alleles present after genome duplication. In the tetraploid genome of MB101 (Figure 5A), only 7% of
genome-wide mutations are 50% heterozygous—i.e., present
before tetraploidy occurred—indicating that most mutations
arise after tetraploidy. However, X hypermutation is already
clearly observable in the fraction of SNVs present before genome
duplication (Figure 5B), demonstrating that this phenomenon
develops even earlier during tumor evolution.
Interestingly, X chromosome hypermutation is not confined
to SNVs but is also observed for somatic indels in those
genomes that display X hypermutation based on SNVs (Figures
5C and 5D).
X chromosome hypermutation is also clearly a somatic phenomenon, as notably fewer germline polymorphisms occur on
the X chromosome compared to the autosomes in our medulloblastoma samples (Figure 5E). Indeed, it is a well-known phenomenon that germline variation is found to be lowest on the
X chromosome, with an  30% lower rate than for the autosomes (Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011).
The distribution of mutations between exons, introns, and
intergenic DNA is not different on the hypermutated X chromosome compared to the autosomes (Figure 5F). Lack of transcription-coupled repair on the largely transcriptionally silent Xi is
unlikely a cause for X hypermutation given the predominantly intergenic location. Further, X chromosome hypermutation cannot
be linked to hypermethylation of Xi at gene promoters, leading to
spontaneous deamination of cytosine because no increase in the
fraction of C > T mutations was found (Figures 1C and 4).
Similar Mutation Spectrum on Autosomes and the
Hypermutated X
Within an individual cancer genome, there is no substantial
variation between the autosomes and X chromosome in the relative contributions of each of the six classes of base substitution
(C > A, C > G, C > T, T > A, T > C, and T > G) (Figure 4). Thus, the
hypermutated X chromosome has the same mutation spectrum
as the autosomes. This holds true even in those cases of lymphoma or neuroblastoma that have a very unique mutation spectrum (Figures 4C and 4D). To provide further insight into the

underlying mutational processes, we incorporated the sequence
context in which mutations occurred by considering the bases
immediately 50 and 30 to each mutated base, giving 96 possible
trinucleotide contexts for a mutation. The resulting heatmap
reveals that the mutational signatures on the autosomes and
the X chromosome are very similar (Figure S3).
Further, principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the
mutation spectrum of the autosomes and the hypermutated
X chromosome of individual samples within one tumor type cluster closer together than the hypermutated X chromosomes of
different tumors (Figure S4A). In addition, the distribution of
mutations along the hypermutated X chromosome is very similar
to the distribution observed on X in males of the same tumor type
(e.g., for B cell lymphoma r2 = 0.64, p < 2 3 1016, Pearson’s
product-moment correlation; Figures S4B and S4C).
We conclude that Xi is hypermutated during tumorigenesis by
the same processes that cause mutations on the autosomes and
Xa as opposed to Xi-specific mutational processes.
Autosomal Regions as Highly Mutated as the X
Chromosome Are Late Replicating
Late-replication timing is known to increase the mutation rate
(Liu et al., 2013). Because regions subject to X inactivation are
known to be late replicating (Hansen et al., 1996; Morishima
et al., 1962), we analyzed whether the autosomes have late-replicating regions as strongly mutated as the hypermutated X chromosome. We used the RepliSeq replication timing data (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE) for 10 different cell lines and
focused on genomic regions that maintain similar replication
timing between these different cell types. Similar to the definition
of X chromosome hypermutation, we defined an autosomal
region to be hypermutated if this region had at least twice the
number of mutations compared to the mean mutation rate of
the autosomes. At the 1 Mb scale, the highest mutated regions
are almost all late replicating, with very few exceptions (Figure 6).
These conclusions were upheld when using alternative genomic
window sizes of 100 kb or 5 Mb (Figure S5). Not every late replicating autosomal region, however, displayed hypermutation.
For B cell lymphoma (Figure 6B), we used only the RepliSeq
data for lymphoblastoid cell lines (n = 5) to match the tumor
cell of origin. The immunoglobulin loci IGH, IGK, and IGL,
which are known to undergo AID-mediated somatic hypermutation in germinal center B cells, were excluded (and showed early
replication timing). However, additional regions affected by AIDmediated somatic hypermutation in germinal center B-cellderived lymphomas, such as the MYC gene region in Burkitt
lymphomas and the BCL2 gene region in follicular lymphomas,
were not excluded and appear as early-replicating, hypermutated regions in this analysis (Figure 6B).
Notably, very few regions on the autosomes are mutated at a
high frequency as the hypermutated X chromosome. Thus, autosomes are also affected by hypermutation in late-replicating
regions but to a much lesser extent than Xi.
Whole-Genome Sequencing of Nonmalignant Somatic
Cells Reveals No X Chromosome Hypermutation

tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma and is observed across a

(A and B) Mutational load per chromosome for female tetraploid medulloblastoma MB101 (A) for all somatic SNVs and (B) only for somatic SNVs with a
clear 50% allele frequency, demonstrating X hypermutation to occur before tetraploidy.
(C) Intermutation distance plot for genome-wide somatic indels of MB101.
(D) X hypermutation is observed for indels (y axis) in those genomes that display X hypermutation based on SNVs (x axis). Values on axes calculated as mutation
rate of X chromosome divided by the mean mutation rate of all autosomes.
(E) Mutational load per chromosome for MB101 using all germline single nucleotide substitutions shows that the X chromosome has less germline substitutions
than the autosomes.
(F) Distribution of somatic SNVs per chromosome into different genomic regions.

the focal somatic hypermutation present in normal immune cells
or with the recently described kataegis phenomenon observed in
some tumors, which is thought to be linked to APOBEC family
cytidine deaminase activity (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012).
We used data from different sequencing technologies (Illumina
and Complete Genomics) sequenced at different centers and
analyzed with different alignment algorithms and mutation calling pipelines. In addition, all genomic somatic mutations from
the University of Washington (AML and retinoblastoma; Welch
et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) were validated by orthogonal
sequencing technologies, which preclude X chromosome hypermutation being an artifact of next-generation sequencing technology and/or analysis methodology.
We sequenced four nonmalignant genomes (three female
samples of HSPCs and one female MDS case) and found no
X hypermutation, despite a sufficiently high number of somatic
mutations, which would have allowed for the identification of
X hypermutation if it were present. Although we cannot conclusively exclude, based on the analysis of these four genomes,
that the higher accumulation of mutations on Xi is due to random
background mutations in healthy somatic cells from females, we
hypothesize that X chromosome hypermutation is a cancerspecific feature.
We propose a model in which Xi accumulates somatic mutations during tumorigenesis not by any specific process acting
exclusively on Xi but by a higher burden of the same processes
mutating the autosomes, thereby resulting in the same mutational spectrum as observed on the autosomes. If Xi hypermutation would be attributed solely to the unique heterochromatin
structure of Xi, one would expect Xi hypermutation to occur
also in normal cells and cancer genomes from female samples
in general, which we did not observe. The mutations on Xi
seem not to be detected and/or repaired as efficiently as on
the autosomes and Xa. Alternatively, it has been reported that
a shortage of nucleotides during late S phase could lead to erroneous incorporation of nucleotides, thus suggesting rather
elevated mutagenesis than impaired repair causing X hypermutation (Burrell et al., 2013). Xi is known to be extremely late replicating in S phase (Hansen et al., 1996; Morishima et al., 1962),
and other late-replicating regions on the autosomes also displayed markedly higher mutation rates. Thus, Xi might not be
properly repaired in aberrantly proliferating cells as a result of a
shorter and/or compromised late S phase caused by DNA replication stress.
This hypothesis is supported by our analysis of retinoblastoma, an aggressive childhood cancer initiated by the biallelic
loss of RB1. Tumors progress very quickly following RB1 inactivation and thereby experience DNA replication stress (Tort et al.,
2006). The retinoblastoma genome of a 21-month-old patient
with only 258 mutations genome wide (Zhang et al., 2012)
already shows strong X chromosome hypermutation, with a
three times higher mutation rate on chromosome X than on the
autosomes (Figure 4B).
A second rapidly growing, malignant childhood tumor, medulloblastoma (Northcott et al., 2012), is also one of the entities
most commonly displaying X chromosome hypermutation. All
medulloblastoma genomes from females with two different
copies of the X chromosome (i.e., a maternal and a paternal

copy) show X hypermutation or an increased rate of X chromosomal mutations. Further, X hypermutation is already present
before tetraploidy, a known early event in this tumor (Jones
et al., 2012). This would be in keeping with our hypothesis that
replication stress may be one of the prerequisites for X chromosome hypermutation because replication stress is one of the
earliest events in tumorigenesis (Bester et al., 2011) and is also
known to cause tetraploidy.
Remarkably, the medulloblastoma genome of female LiFraumeni syndrome case LFS-MB1 is one of the strongest
X hypermutated samples, although the patient’s secondary
MDS genome shows no X hypermutation (Figure 7D and 7E),
supporting our suggestion that X hypermutation is a cancer-specific feature.
Given the data presented here, we hypothesize that hypermutation of Xi is one of the earliest events in tumorigenesis occurring in response to replication stress in cancer cells. Future
investigation into the detailed mechanistic basis and extent of
hypermutation on the inactive X chromosome may therefore provide novel insights into how tumor cells, and in particular the
DNA repair machinery, respond to early oncogenic stresses.
Our study makes an important contribution toward ongoing
efforts to solve the fundamental question of where and how cancer genomes acquire mutations.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Sequence Variant Discovery and Analysis
For our own data sets (medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, B cell lymphoma,
ependymoma, glioblastoma, and prostate carcinoma), Illumina sequence
data were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome assembly using
BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009); duplicate and nonuniquely mapping reads were
excluded. We subsequently detected SNVs and InDels with complementary
computational approaches (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Somatic
genome-wide single-nucleotide variants of published cancer data sets from
other institutes were obtained from the supplemental data files of the
respective publications; no additional filtering of these mutation call sets
was performed.
Clonal Expansion of Single Healthy Somatic Cells
Bone marrow mononuclear cells from a healthy 73-year-old female were
thawed and labeled with Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-CD34 (581, Biolegend), Alexa-Fluor 700-conjugated anti-CD38 (HIT2, eBioscience), a cocktail
of APC-conjugated lineage antibodies consisting of anti-CD4 (RPA-T4), antiCD8 (RPA-T8), anti-CD11b (ICRF44), anti-CD20 (2H7), anti-CD56 (B159, all
BD Biosciences), anti-CD14 (61D3), anti-CD19 (HIB19), and anti-CD235a
(HIR2, all eBiocience), and 1 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Using a BD
FACSAria cell sorter, single LinCD34+CD38PI cells were individually
sorted into low-adhesion 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) containing
100 ml of StemSpan Serum-Free Expansion Medium (Stemcell technologies)
supplemented with 100 ng/ml of human SCF and FLT-3L, 50 ng/ml of human
TPO, 20 ng/ml of human IL-3, IL-6, and G-CSF (all cytokines from Peprotech),
and 50 U/ml of penicillin and 50 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were
incubated at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air. After
5 days in culture, another 100 ml of cytokine-containing medium were added.
13 days after seeding, clones B6 and G2 had expanded to 105 cells and were
selected for whole-genome sequencing (2 3 101 bp, paired-end, Illumina
HiSeq2500) after tagmentation-based library preparation (see Extended
Experimental Procedures) for clone B6 and standard library preparation for
clone G2. For germline-control, 106 unsorted bone marrow mononuclear
cells from the same donor were used for sequencing. An average of 30-fold

A progenitor cell clone was raised from a peripheral blood sample of a 39year-old healthy female. Frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated from 2 ml heparinised peripheral blood via Ficoll Paque density
centrifugation. A methylcellulose assay was performed as described earlier
(Weisse et al., 2012). In brief, nonadherent mononuclear cells were incubated
in the presence of the recombinant human cytokines IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF
(R&D systems) over 14 days to induce colony formation. Colonies were
detected under an inverted light microscope and were plucked by a pipette
when colonies had 10,000 cells/CFU. Each colony was washed three times
in PBS and finally frozen as a cell pellet in 80 C. Genomic DNA was isolated
using the QIAamp DNA micro kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (QIAGEN, Hilden). Whole-genome sequencing (2 3 101 bp, paired-end,
Illumina HiSeq2500) was performed for colony 4 after tagmentation-based
library preparation and resulted in 15-fold sequence coverage for each the
colony and the matching whole blood.
