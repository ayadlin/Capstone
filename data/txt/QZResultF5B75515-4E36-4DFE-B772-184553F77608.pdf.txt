Abstract

Author Manuscript

Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a multifunctional protein required for normal collagen and elastin
biosynthesis and maturation. In addition, LOX has complex roles in cancer in which the lysyl
oxidase propeptide (LOX-PP) domain of secreted pro-LOX has tumor suppressor activity, while
the active enzyme promotes metastasis. In prostate cancer cell lines, recombinant LOX-PP (rLOXPP) inhibits the growth of PC3 cells in vitro by mechanisms which were not characterized, while
in DU145 cells rLOX-PP targeted FGF signaling. Because rLOX-PP can enhance effects of a
genotoxic chemotherapeutic on breast cancer cell apoptosis, we reasoned that rLOX-PP could
target DNA repair pathways typically elevated in cancer. Here we demonstrate for the first time
that rLOX-PP inhibits prostate xenograft growth in vivo and that activating phosphorylations of
the key DNA repair molecules ATM and CHK2 are inhibited by rLOX-PP expression in vivo. In
addition, in vitro studies showed that rLOX-PP inhibits radiation induced activating
phosphorylations of ATM and CHK2, and that exogenously added rLOX-PP protein can localize
to the nucleus in both DU145 and PC3 cells. rLOX-PP pull-down studies resulted in detection of a
protein complex with the nuclear DNA repair regulator MRE11 in both cell lines, and rLOX-PP
localized to radiation-induced nuclear DNA repair foci. Finally, rLOX-PP was shown to sensitize
both DU145 and PC3 cells to radiation-induced cell death determined in colony formation assays.
These data provide evidence that rLOX-PP has a nuclear mechanism of action in which it directly
interacts with DNA repair proteins to sensitize prostate cancer cells to the effects of ionizing
radiation.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene has been shown to have “RAS recision” activity (Contente et
al., 1990; Kenyon et al., 1991). LOX is synthesized and secreted as a 50 kDa proenzyme,
and is then processed extracellularly to a ~30 kDa mature LOX enzyme and an ~18 kDa
lysyl oxidase propeptide (LOX-PP) by procollagen C-proteinases (1, 2) The active enzyme
is essential for biosynthetic collagen cross-linking, while the propeptide of LOX (LOX-PP)
is a tumor growth inhibitor and has multiple mechanisms of action. Interestingly, active
lysyl oxidase enzymes promote invasiveness in metastasis (3), but the unique propeptide
region of LOX in particular acts as a tumor suppressor (4–6). Recombinant LOX-PP (rLOXPP) has Ras recision activity and inhibits breast, prostate and lung cancer cell growth (7–9)
and was recently shown to also inhibit Ewing sarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cell
growth (10, 11). Purified rLOX-PP protein inhibits tumor growth after both direct
intratumoral injection and by a slow release formulation in Her2/neu breast cancer cell
xenografts (12). Thus, rLOX-PP is now understood to have therapeutic potential. In prostate
cancer cells, we have shown in vitro that rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2/FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1)
interaction via an extracellular mechanism resulting in attenuated RAS/ERK/AKT signaling
in DU145 prostate cancer cells (8). However, mechanisms of action by which rLOX-PP
inhibits PC3 prostate cancer cell growth are not well characterized (8). Separate studies
indicate that rLOX-PP can enhance apoptosis of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines in the
presence of doxorubicin, but not in the absence of doxorubicin (7). Because the mechanisms
of action of doxorubicin include increased DNA damage (13), we reasoned that rLOX-PP
could interact with or target DNA repair pathways which are elevated in cancer and which
prevent mitotic catastrophe (14).

DNA damage in cells activates a complex DNA damage response (DDR). This response
normally coordinates cell cycle progression with DNA repair to maintain genomic stability.
Defects in the DDR cascade can inhibit cell cycle checkpoints, decrease repair responses
and increase sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. In
response to DNA damage, a protein complex which contains MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1
(MRN complex) binds to and activates ATM protein kinase which initiates a downstream
signal transduction cascade essential for coordinating cell cycle progression with DNA
repair. The elevated ability to repair DNA is a characteristic of tumor cells even in the
absence of acute radiation, enabling continued proliferation and dissemination. Moreover,
overexpression of key DNA repair enzymes results in increased cancer cell invasiveness and
tumor formation (15, 16). Chemotherapeutic inhibition of DNA damage repair responses is,
therefore, an effective strategy to inhibit tumor growth with or without accompanying
radiation therapy.

The present report shows that ectopic overexpression of rLOX-PP inhibits prostate cancer
xenograft growth in both PC3 and DU145 cells. rLOX-PP inhibited IR-induced activating
phosphorylations of ATM and CHK2, and increased DNA fragmentation. rLOX-PP was
observed to be taken up by PC3 and DU145 cells with accumulation in nuclei. Moreover,
rLOX-PP co-localized with repair foci and formed protein complexes with MRE11, and
sensitized prostate cancer cells to IR. These data strongly suggest that one mechanism of
action of rLOX-PP is to target DNA repair pathways. Thus, we propose that rLOX-PP or a

derivative could have the potential to be used in conjunction with radiation and/or genotoxic
cancer therapy.

Results
Ectopic overexpression of LOX-PP inhibits mouse prostate cancer subcutaneous
xenografts

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that rLOX-PP inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in vitro (8).
Here we hypothesize that rLOX-PP could inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cell lines by
targeting DNA repair pathways. This idea is based on the finding that rLOX-PP enhances
inhibition of cancer cell growth by a genotoxic agent (7), and on reports indicating that
DNA repair pathways are elevated in cancer and promote metastasis (15–17). In order to
first evaluate whether rLOX-PP can inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in vivo, we created
xenografts in nude mice with PC3 cells and DU145 cells, respectively. PC3 and DU145
cells were stably transduced with rLOX-PP expressing- or Empty lentivirus (Materials and
Methods and Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows that growth of DU145 xenografts was slower in
rLOX-PP expressing xenografts compared to controls, and that tumor weight at sacrifice
was 50% of control tumors (Figure 1C). PC3 xenografts expressing rLOX-PP grew slower
than corresponding controls (Figure 1D), with smaller tumors observed at sacrifice (Figure
1E). Data indicate that ectopic expression of rLOX-PP inhibits tumor growth by at least 50%
compared to empty vector controls. These findings demonstrate that prostate cancer
xenografts are responsive to rLOX-PP in vivo.

ATM is a master regulator of double strand break repair. It auto-phosphorylates Ser1981
after binding to the MRN complex of proteins (18). Active phosphorylated ATM is a
signaling kinase which phosphorylates a variety of downstream effectors including CHK2
that limits the cell cycle and/or promotes apoptosis (19). Activating phosphorylations of
both ATM and CHK2 from protein extracts obtained from xenografts were measured. Figure
1F shows that ATM and CHK2 phosphorylations were inhibited by overexpression of
rLOX-PP in tumor xenografts, particularly in PC3-derived xenografts.
In vitro radiation induced ATM and CHK2 phosphorylations and rLOX-PP

Author Manuscript

We next evaluated whether rLOX-PP could inhibit IR-stimulated DNA repair pathways in
vitro. Radiation therapy induces a DDR response and inhibition of this response in cancer
cells by chemotherapeutics is an effective anticancer therapeutic strategy (16). ATM is
activated by IR and its phosphorylation of CHK2 on Thr68 initiates a phosphorylation
cascade that promotes the full activity of Chk2 and cell cycle arrest (20). Thus, DU145 and
PC3 cells transduced to express rLOX-PP, and empty vector transduced cells, were
subjected to 5 Gy IR for different time intervals. Cell proteins were extracted for Western
blotting for phosphorylated ATM (Figure 2) and phosphorylated CHK2 (Figure 3). Data
show that cells expressing rLOX-PP exhibited significantly reduced levels of both ATMand CHK2 phosphorylation after 10 min and 1 hr of radiation exposure.
To determine whether rLOX-PP expression actually resulted in increased radiation-induced
DNA damage, genomic DNA was isolated from irradiated cells and subjected to agaorse gel

electrophoresis to assess for DNA fragmentation levels. Data in Figure 3E clearly show that
rLOX-PP expression results in increased DNA damage.
rLOX-PP inhibition of DNA repair and RAS signaling
It has been previously reported that rLOX-PP inhibits RAS-dependent signaling (6). To
investigate whether the ability of rLOX-PP to inhibit DNA repair induced by IR is mediated
by RAS-dependent signaling, we assessed changes in ERK1/2 and AKT activation as a
function of rLOX-PP expression in IR-treated and control DU145 and PC3 cells. Data in
Figure 4 indicate that IR-induced ERK1/2 and AKT activation are not inhibited in cells
expressing rLOX-PP. These data suggest that LOX-PP inhibition of IR-induced DNA
damage is not primarily the result of its inhibition of IR-induced RAS signaling.
rLOX-PP nuclear localization in DU145 and PC3 cells

Author Manuscript

In order to evaluate whether rLOX-PP can internalize into the cytoplasm and ultimately into
the cell nucleus of prostate cancer cells to directly target DDR response proteins, we
covalently labeled biologically active rLOX-PP protein that contains a C-terminal-myc-His6
tag with ATTO565. The ATTO565 molecule (4-[4- (dimethylamino)phenylazo]benzoic
acid) is a highly sensitive red fluorescent dye that is resistant to photo-bleaching (21).
rLOX-PP contains no cysteine and a one lysine residue located in the C-terminal myc-His6
tag, and none are present in LOX-PP itself (22). rLOX-PP was, therefore, labeled with
ATTO565 as described in Materials and Methods. Incubation of cells with 4 μg/ml –
rLOXPP-ATTO565 for 36 hours followed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and
analyses of Z-stack images revealed nuclear association of rLOX-PP in both DU145 and
PC3 cells (Figure 5A and 5B).

rLOX-PP interacts with the MRN complex protein MRE11

Author Manuscript

If rLOX-PP directly inhibits DNA repair, it can be expected to bind one or more component
of the MRN complex in its mechanism of action. We, therefore, studied direct binding of
rLOX-PP with DNA repair proteins by pull down assays employing PC3 and DU145 cells
transduced to express rLOX-PP or control empty vector. Cell extracts were incubated with
non-immune IgG or anti-c-Myc tag IgG covalently attached to agarose beads (Pierce). Beads
were washed and rLOX-PP containing protein complexes were eluted and analyzed as
described in the Materials and Methods and Figure 5. The data show that rLOX-PP has
specific direct or indirect interactions with MRE11 in PC3 and DU145 cells (Figure 5C and
5D) but not with ATR, Rad 50 or NBS1 (data not shown). MRE11 is a component of the
MRN complex (18), and ATM binds to and is activated by the MRN complex. These
findings point to the likelihood that rLOX-PP inhibits DNA repair pathways by binding to
components of the DNA DSB repair complex.
rLOX-PP is present in DNA damage induced repair foci
Histone H2AX is a substrate of ATM kinase to form phosphorylated-H2AX, which is a
component and excellent marker of the DNA double strand break repair complex and of
DNA repair foci (23, 24). Next we asked whether rLOX-PP is a component of IR-induced
repair foci. rLOX-PP-ATTO565 treated PC3- and DU145 cells were irradiated with 5 Gy

IR, and then stained for phosphorylated-H2AX and MRE11 (Materials and Methods). Figure
6 shows that IR increased the presence of repair foci, and that rLOX-PP co-localized with
phosphorylated-H2AX, and MRE11-containing nuclear foci.
rLOX-PP inhibits clonogenic survival in response to radiation

Author Manuscript

Based on these data we predicted that LOX-PP would sensitize PC3 and DU145 cells to
ionizing radiation. Cells expressing rLOX-PP or transduced with empty lentivirus were
subjected to different doses of IR. Live cells were sorted by flow cytometry and were plated.
Colonies were allowed to grow for 2 weeks (Materials and Methods). DU145 and PC3 cells
expressing rLOX-PP resulted in fewer colonies at all doses of IR compared to empty cells
(Figure 7). Correcting for plating efficiency determined at 0 Gy, the surviving fraction in
rLOX-PP expressing cells was significantly diminished compared to the empty control
(p<0.001); and the size of colonies was smaller in the rLOX-PP expressing cells (Figure 7).
rLOX-PP significantly decreased colonies in the prostate cancer cells treated with 1–2 Gy
IR. This finding shows that rLOX-PP is effective at sensitizing cancer cells in vitro to
radiation at clinically relevant doses used in radiation therapy in vivo. (25).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Biologic chemotherapeutics which inhibit a single specific pathway and are effective in the
short term are often not effective to treat cancer in the long term due to development of drug
resistance and robust relapse (26–29). Up-regulation of DNA repair pathways is one way in
which tumor cells become resistant to therapy and through which mitotic catastrophe is
avoided in damaged tumor cells (14). In our opinion, there is a place for derivatives of
biomolecules which can inhibit tumor growth by multiple mechanisms of action and which
would have therapeutic value with low toxicity. Such agents could be used in conjunction
with more conventional chemotherapeutic and/or radiation protocols and could reduce the
dosing requirements of the harsher therapeutics. rLOX-PP inhibits tumor growth by several
mechanisms of action and targets both cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling
molecules (4, 8, 12, 30–34). rLOX-PP tumor inhibitory properties are mediated by inhibiting
RAS, FGFR1, β-catenin activation, and/or FAK signaling. Although rLOX-PP inhibits
serum-induced stimulation in both DU145 and PC3 cells, this activity is mediated by FGF-2/
FGFR1 signaling in DU145 cells and not in PC3 cells.

Author Manuscript

As noted, DNA repair pathways are often up-regulated in cancer cells to help avoid mitotic
catastrophe (14). The protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an apical
activator of the DNA damage response at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (35). The
MRN complex is required for optimal ATM activation at DSBs (36), and is one of the first
complexes to be recruited to DSB sites, where it acts as a damage sensor that can also form a
physical bridge spanning the DSB ends. It is required for timely repair by both nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). MRE11 takes part in
DSB end resection, which is essential for homologous DNA repair (35). The interaction of
ATM with the MRN complex initiates a highly coordinated program of further recruitment
of DNA damage response proteins including MDC1 (Mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint
Protein 1) and other proteins to sites of DSB repair (37). rLOX-PP robust inhibition of ATM

and CHK2 phosphorylation in xenografts grown in mice even without radiation treatment
suggests that DNA repair pathways could be a target of rLOX-PP in these cells. Inhibition
by rLOX-PP of both ATM and CHK2 phosphorylation and reduced colony formation
occurred after IR in vitro in both cell lines. These data suggest that rLOX-PP inhibition of
DNA repair pathways can occur in both cell lines. ATM activity inhibition enhances the
sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of IR and to sensitizing chemotherapeutic
agents (38–40). The downstream target of ATM is CHK2 which causes cell cycle arrest and
provides cells time to repair DNA. Selective CHK1 and CHK2 inhibitors such as 7hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), aminopyrazine XL844, AZD7762 (a thiophene urea
carboxamide) are in clinical trials to inhibit tumor growth (41). CHK2-specific inhibitors as
isothiazole carboximidamine, VRX046617, and the bis-guanylhydrazone NSC 109555 have
been identified to target DNA damage repair pathways in cancer cells (42, 43). In our
studies, rLOX-PP inhibits activating phosphorylation of CHK2 in both of the two androgenindependent prostate cancer cell lines examined.

Author Manuscript

rLOX-PP can enter nuclei and forms complexes with MRE11 in both PC3 and DU145 cells.
In DSB repair complexes, ATM, MRE11 and phosphorylated-H2AX are present in DNA
repair foci. MRE11 is the core of the MRN complex and interacts with both RAD50 and
NBS1 (44–46). Further, in mammalian cells the MRE11 complex mediates the S-phase
checkpoint through an interaction with replication protein A (47). Our data suggest that
rLOX-PP disrupts productive functional interactions involved in the MRN complexes
resulting in inhibited downstream signaling required for DNA repair. Moreover, MRE11 is a
nuclease which has a role in DNA splicing in DSB repair (48). MRE11 is a conserved
protein with an N-terminal nuclease domain (49, 50) and a DNA-binding region (51, 52)
encompassing the glycine-arginine motif which is predicted to regulate DNA double-strand
break processing (53). Further studies are required to determine whether or not MRE11 is a
direct binding partner for rLOX-PP in its ability to inhibit the DSB repair response.
rLOX-PP was localized to phosphorylated-H2AX- and MRE11-containing DNA damageinduced foci which confirms that rLOX-PP binds to DSB complexes. In order to arrest cell
cycle progression at sites containing damaged chromatin, phosphorylated-H2AX is required
for the assembly of DNA repair protein complexes and for activation of checkpoint proteins.
H2AX-containng nuclear foci are used to detect genotoxic effects and to monitor the
efficiency of anticancer treatment to predict of tumor cell sensitivity to gentotoxic anticancer
agents (54). H2AX becomes extensively phosphorylated within three minutes of DNA
damage, forms foci at break sites and recruits other factors at foci. The product of the tumor
suppressor gene BRCA1 also co localizes with phosphorylated-H2AX and is recruited to
these sites before Rad50 or Rad51 (55).

Author Manuscript

In summary, rLOX-PP sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation in clonogenic survival assays at
clinically relevant doses of IR in both PC3 and DU145 cell lines. Clinically in prostate
cancer patients, conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy uses 1.8 – 2.0
Gy/fraction. (56). Moreover, rLOX-PP interferes with the DSB repair response in cancer
cells by inhibiting ATM and CHK2 phosphorylation. rLOX-PP interacts with MRE11 and
H2AX foci. Thus, we propose that a mechanism of action of the rLOX-PP effect is through
its interaction with the MRN complex, and inhibition of DSB repair signaling. This study

raises the novel concept that rLOX-PP, or a derivative, could be used in combination with
radiation therapy and/or with genotoxic drugs, increasing the effectiveness of these
conventional therapies. Evaluation of the responsiveness of rLOX-PP in pre-clinical
orthotropic mouse models in combination with DNA damaging agents including radiation
and/or DNA-directed chemotherapeutic drugs is now of considerable interest.

All in vivo experiments were approved by Boston University Medical Center IACUC. PC3
and DU145 cells were stably transduced with rLOX-PP expressing lentivirus particles
EF1α-LOX-PP-myc-his-UBC-GFP (designated as rLOX-PP) and empty vector EF1αEmpty-UBC-GFP (designated as Empty). Cells transduced with rLOX-PP- or Empty
constructs (4×106 cells) were respectively injected subcutaneously into the midline dorsa (n
= 5) of NCR nu/nu mice (Taconic Farms, Hudson, NY) as single cell suspensions in serumfree DMEM. Caliper measurements were performed at regular intervals to monitor the
volumes of all tumors. Tumors were harvested at sacrifice, weighed and snap frozen, ground
to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and then extracted for Western blotting.
Western blots

Author Manuscript

Tumor samples or cell layers were extracted into SDS PAGE sample buffer (0.1 mM TrisHCl, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for three to five minutes.
Cell culture media samples were boiled after adding one volume of 2X SDS PAGE sample
buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using Nano Orange assay kits (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR). From tumors, approximately 40 micrograms of protein from 3 tumors
per experimental group were then subjected to 6% or 10% SDS PAGE and Western blotting
with primary antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The antibodies
used were phospho-ATM (#5883), ATM (#2873), phospho-CHK2 (#2661), CHK2 (#2662)
and MRE11 (#4895) and normalization control β-actin (#4970). LOX-PP antibody was
prepared as described earlier (8). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA; 7074 and 7076, respectively).
The quantifications were performed by a digital densitometry system (Versadoc; BioRad,
Hercules, CA) and Image J software.

PC3 and DU145 cells expressing rLOX-PP or empty vector controls were plated and grown
in DMEM/F12K media with 10% serum under standard conditions. Cells were transduced
with the rLOX-PP or empty lentivirus particles and plated in 6-well plates (57). At 80%
visual confluence, cells were placed in serum-free medium overnight. Cultures (n = 3) were
then irradiated with 5 Gy IR with a [137Cs] γ-irradiator. Cells were cultured for an additional
10 min, 1 hr and 6 hrs and cell layers were collected as described above in SDS PAGE

rLOX-PP uptake studies were performed by labeling rLOX-PP at the N-terminus and at the
only lysine residue which is located in the C-terminal myc-His6 tag employing the Nhydrosuccinamide ester of ATTO565 (4-[4-(dimethylamino)phenylazo]benzoic acid)
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). rLOX-PP (2 mg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer
(pH=8.3) was treated with a 10-fold molar excess of ATTO565-NHS ester and incubated at
37°C for 3 hrs, followed by incubation at 4°C overnight (58, 59). The samples were diluted
with 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 10 M urea (pH 7.8) resulting in a final urea
concentration of 4 M. In order to remove unlabeled dye, the sample was subjected to gel
filtration chromatography through a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
WA, PD MiniTrap™ G-25, #28-9180-07). The column was pre-equilibrated with 200 mM
sodium phosphate buffer with 10 M urea (pH 7.8) and eluted with same buffer at room
temperature. The flow-through fraction containing rLOX-PP–ATTO565 was collected.
Labeled rLOX-PP was then dialyzed against water using 10,000 Dalton molecular weight
cut off Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). To confirm that
free dye was removed, samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE gel and compared to the
mobility of free ATTO565 dye and imaged (Ex 565 nm, Em 592 nm) with a Molecular
Imager FX (Biorad, Hercules, CA). The stoichiometry of ATTO565 labeling of rLOX-PP
was calculated based on extinction coefficients of rLOX-PP and ATTO565 (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR). The extinction coefficient of ATTO565 is 120,000 L mol−1 cm−1 (563
nm) and rLOX-PP is 19,480 L mol−1 cm−1 (280 nm). Uptake studies were performed in live
cells by plating 30,000 PC3 and DU145 cells in F12K or DMEM media (10% FBS, 1%
penicillin-streptomycin) in chamber slides, respectively, and cultured overnight. The cells
were replenished with serum-free F12K or DMEM media containing 0.1% BSA, and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin for 24 hrs. rLOX-PP-ATTO565 was then added as indicated and
incubated for another 36 hrs. The cells were imaged with a Zeiss 710 dual scanner confocal
microscope as indicated.
DNA fragmentation assay

Author Manuscript

In order to determine the direct physical effect of LOX-PP on IR induced DNA damage, a
DNA fragmentation assay was performed (60). Empty vector and rLOX-PP expressing PC3
and DU145 cells were cultured and treated with IR (5 Gy). After 24 hr, cells were lysed in
0.2% Triton X-100; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA. Samples were centrifuged and
supernatants extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) twice. DNA was precipitated by adding of 5 M NaCl to a
final concentration of 300 mM and 2.5 volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol, washed with 70%
ethanol, dried and suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA. DNA samples (25
μg each) were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis analysis.
rLOX-PP Pull down assays
Empty vector and rLOX-PP expressing PC3 and DU145 cells were cultured, extracted into
non-denaturing RIPA cell lysis buffer and incubated with agarose bead-immobilized nonimmune IgG or anti-c-Myc tag IgG overnight at 4°C to pull down rLOX-PP. Non-immune
IgG (#31903, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was coupled to agarose using AminoLink

manufacturer’s instructions. For pull-down assays, beads were washed, and then eluted
according to kit instructions (ProFound c-Myc Tag IP/Co-IP Kit; Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Eluted samples were analyzed by Western blotting on denaturing SDS
PAGE probed with an anti-ATM, anti-ATR, Rad50, anti-NBS1 and anti-MRE11 antibodies
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and with anti-rLOX-PP antibody (61). Aliquots (5%) of
initial extracts taken before the immunoprecipitation were analyzed by Western blot on the
same gels.

DU145 and PC3 cells were respectively plated in chamber slides and cultured for 18 hrs in
standard media with serum. Cells were incubated for an additional 36 hrs in serum-free
media supplemented with rLOX-PP-ATTO565 at 10 μg/ml, or vehicle. After incubation, the
cells were subjected to IR (5 Gy) and allowed to recover for 1 hr. The cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and blocked with blocking buffer (1X PBS/5% normal
rabbit serum/0.3% Triton™ X-100) for 1 hr. Cells were incubated with anti-MRE 11
antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, #4895) or rabbit non-immune control IgG (1.1
μg/ml) in 1X PBS, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton™ X-100) for 2 hrs. Cells were washed and treated
with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, #4414;
400 μg/ml) to respective samples, and incubated for an additional 1 hr and were extensively
washed 3 times with PBS. Samples were then incubated with rabbit IgG non-immune
control antibody and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. This step blocks
any remaining free Alexa Fluor 647 labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody for the
subsequent step. Finally, anti-phosphohistone H2AX rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA, #9719) or its isotype control (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, #2975), each directly
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 in antibody dilution buffer (1X PBS/1% BSA/0.3%
Triton™ X-100), were added in respective samples and incubated for 2 hr at room
temperature in the dark. Anti-fade reagent with DAPI was added to all the samples and
imaged. A Zeiss 710 dual scanner confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat objective,
oil immersion lens and a CCD detector was used to obtain confocal images. Image
acquisition was performed with Zeiss Zen image analysis software (Carl Zeiss Micro
Imaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The image analysis was performed using Zeiss LSM

Clonogenic survival assay

Author Manuscript

Empty vector and rLOX-PP expressing DU145 and PC3 cells were plated and grown in
DMEM and 10% serum under standard conditions in 6-well plates. At 80% visual
confluence, cells were placed in serum-free medium overnight. Cells expressing rLOX-PP
and their respective controls (n=6) were then irradiated and then plated in 6-well plates as
follows. Cells were trypsinized and subjected to sorting (Aria FACS, BioRad, Hercules,
CA). The cell sorting was performed to exclude dead cells due to IR treatment by utilizing
the Near-IR dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). The number of cells needed
for successful initial plating of 5,000 and 10,000 cells per well in 6-well plates was

determined based on the plating efficiency determined at 0 Gy. The clonogenic survival
assay, calculation of plating efficiency and the survival fraction determinations were
performed as described (62, 63). Colonies were allowed to grow for 14 days, and cultures
were then fixed, and stained with crystal violet and colony numbers were determined using a
Versadoc Photodocumentation System and Quantity One colony counting software (BioRad,
Hercules, CA). The survival fraction was calculated and plotted as described (62).
Statistical analysis
Analyses of all experiments were done using two way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc
analysis or Student’s t-test (Graph Pad Prism 5 software, La Jolla, CA) as indicated in
Figure legends. All experiments were performed at least three times.

DMEM media (0.1% BSA, 1 % penicillin-streptomycin) for 24 hrs. rLOX-PP labeled with
ATTO565 (4 μg/ml rLOX-PP-ATTO565) was added as indicated and incubated for 36 hrs,
and subjected to confocal microscopy by using Zeiss 710 dual scanner confocal microscope
in a live cell imaging chamber at 37°C with 5% CO2. (A and B) Confocal microscopy
revealed apparent nuclear and cytoplasmic association of rLOX-PP in PC3 and DU145 cells,
respectively. In each panel the images shown from left to right are phase contrast, rLOX-PPATTO565, Hoechst staining to label nuclei, and corresponding merged images showing in
addition the 0.2 micrometer plane (Z-stack) derived from the indicated cross-section in the
cell nucleus. For LOX-PP interaction studies (Panels C – F), PC3 (C and D) and DU145 (E
and F) empty vector and rLOX-PP expressing PC3 and DU145 cells were cultured,
extracted into non-denaturing cell lysis RIPA buffer. Cells were washed extensively with
PBS, lysed and extracted with 500 μl non-denaturing cell lysis buffer (Profound c-Myc Tag
IP/Co-IP kit; Thermo Scientific). Agarose beads with covalently bound non-immune IgG or
anti-Myc-tag IgG antibody was added to samples and incubated overnight at 4° C to pull
down rLOX-PP and any bound proteins. Resins were transferred to columns, washed, and
then subjected to an acid elution protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. (C)
Western blot analysis of 5% input samples from PC3-Empty and from PC3-LOX-PP cells in
lanes 1 and 2 demonstrates the presence of MRE11. Eluted samples from non-immune IgG
agarose in lanes 3 and 4 and from anti-Myc-tag IgG in lanes 5 and 6 identify MRE11 only
from cells expressing rLOX-PP and only in the anti-Myc tag IgG agarose pull down, as
expected; (D) detection of immunoprecipitated rLOX-PP after stripping and re-probing with
anti-LOX-PP antibody showing endogenous 50 kDa pro-lysyl oxidase in lanes 7 and 8, and
rLOX-PP in lanes 8 and 12 only. (E) Western blot analysis of 5% input samples from
DU145-Empty and from DU145-LOX-PP cells in lanes 13 and 14 demonstrates the
presence of MRE11. Eluted samples from non-immune IgG agarose in lanes 15 and 16 and
from anti-Myc-tag IgG in lanes 17 and 18 identify MRE11 only from cells expressing
rLOX-PP and only in the anti-Myc tag IgG agarose pull down, as expected; (F) detection of
immunoprecipitated rLOX-PP after stripping and re-probing with anti-LOX-PP antibody
identified rLOX-PP in lane 24 only, as expected. The experiments were repeated 3 times
each from protein extracts from 3 different batches of cells with the same outcomes.

PC3 (A) or DU145 (B) cells were respectively cultured in chamber slides for 18 hrs in
standard media with 10% serum, treated with labeled rLOX-PP (rLOX-PP-ATTO565) for
36 hrs for direct detection. Cells were subjected to 5 Gy IR. After 1 hour, irradiated and nonirradiated control cells were fixed, stained and subjected to confocal microscopy for rLOXPP-ATTO565, phosphorylated-H2AX and MRE11 (Materials and Methods). Row A1, PC3
cells not treated with IR; row A2, PC3 cells no radiation control probed with antiphosphorylated-H2AX; row A3, PC3 cells treated with IR in the presence of rLOX-PPATTO565, and probed with isotype non-immune antibody (negative control for anti-H2AX
antibody), row A4, PC3 cells treated with IR in the absence of rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and
probed with anti-phosphorylated-H2AX antibody; row A5, PC3 cells treated with IR and
rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed with anti-phosphorylated-H2AX- and visualized for
presence of rLOX-PP-ATTO565; row A6, PC3 cells treated with IR and rLOX-PP, and
probed with MRE 11- and visualized for presence of rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and row A7, PC3
cells treated with IR and rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed with anti-phosphorylated-H2AX
and MRE 11 antibody. Row B1; DU145 cells not treated with IR; row B2, DU145 cells not
treated with IR but probed with anti-phosphorylated-H2AX antibody to detect endogenous
expression of phosphorylated-H2AX independent of radiation treatment; row B3, DU145
cells treated with IR in the presence of rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed with isotype
control antibody for anti-phosphorylated-H2AX; row B4, DU145 cells treated with IR in the
absence of rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed for phosphorylated-H2AX; row B5, DU145
cells treated with IR and rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed with anti-phosphorylated-H2AX
and visualized for presence of rLOX-PP-ATTO565; row B6, DU145 cells treated with IR
and rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed with MRE 11- and anti-LOX-PP antibody; and row
B7, DU145 cells treated with IR and rLOX-PP-ATTO565, and probed with antiphosphorylated-H2AX and MRE 11 antibody.

Figure 7. LOX-PP inhibits clonogenic survival in response to different doses of radiation

Author Manuscript

PC3 and DU145 cells were transduced with Empty- and rLOX-PP-expressing lentiviruses
and cells were grown under standard cell culture conditions and subjected to 0, 0.5,1, 2, 3, 5,
7.5 and 10 Gy of ionizing radiation. Cells were sorted to exclude dead cells and live cells
were plated at 5000 or 1000 live cells in 6-well cell culture plates. Colonies were allowed to
grow for 14 days, and cultures were then fixed and then stained with crystal violet. The
survival fraction was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. (A) PC3-Empty or
PC3-LOX-PP cells surviving fraction as a function of radiation dose; (B) respective images
of cells stained with 0.5% crystal violet; (C) DU145-Empty or DU145-LOX-PP cells
surviving fraction as a function of radiation dose; (D) respective images stained with 0.5%
crystal violet; (n=6); * p<0.05; student’s t-test from one representative experiment of three
performed with the same outcomes.
