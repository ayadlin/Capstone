Abstract
Both tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) and cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) display specific phenotypic and functional features and contribute to tumor
cell niche. However, their bidirectional crosstalk has been poorly studied, in particular
in the context of hematological malignancies. Follicular lymphomas (FL) and diffuse
large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are two germinal center-derived lymphomas where
various cell components of infiltrating microenvironment, including TAN and CAFs,
have been demonstrated to favor directly and indirectly malignant B-cell survival,
growth, and drug resistance. We show here that, besides a direct and contactdependent supportive effect of neutrophils on DLBCL B-cell survival, mediated through
the BAFF/APRIL pathway, neutrophils and stromal cells cooperate to sustain FL B-cell
growth. This cooperation relies on an overexpression of IL-8 by lymphoma-infiltrating
stromal cells that could thereafter efficiently promote neutrophil survival and prime
them to neutrophil extracellular trap. Conversely, neutrophils are able to activate
stromal cells in a NF-κB-dependent manner, inducing their commitment towards an
inflammatory lymphoid stroma phenotype associated with an increased capacity to
trigger malignant B-cell survival, and to recruit additional monocytes and neutrophils
through the release of CCL2 and IL-8, respectively. Altogether, a better understanding
of the lymphoma-supporting effects of neutrophils could be helpful to design new
anti-tumor therapeutic strategies.

counterpart (TAM) until the demonstration that they could
persist within inflamed tissues where they exhibit both
phenotypic and functional heterogeneity, including the
production of a wide range of cytokines and chemokines
[1, 2]. TAN have been recently shown to exert both proand antitumor activities, including triggering of genomic
instability, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and tumor
cell metastasis on the one hand versus direct cytotoxic

Tumorigenesis is widely recognized as a noncell autonomous process depending on the continuous
active crosstalk between malignant cells and various
stromal and immune cell subsets of their surrounding
microenvironment. Tumor infiltrating neutrophils (TAN)

effect and recruitment or activation of other effectors
of innate and adaptive antitumor immunity on the other
hand [3]. In turn, TAN recruitment and polarization are
triggered by tumor cell-derived signals [4, 5]. Cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs) also contribute to tumorsupportive cell niche and have been shown to display
tumor-specific transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional
features compared to normal tissue fibroblasts [6]. CAFs
could support directly tumor cell survival, growth,
metastasis, and drug resistance but they have also been
involved in reshaping tumor microenvironment. Resident
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are believed to be
the major precursors of CAFs in situ and to acquire their
tumor promoting properties after exposition to tumorderived activating stimuli. Whereas their impact on
neutrophil activation remains controversial, bone marrow
(BM)-MSCs have been repeatedly shown to sustain
neutrophil survival, in particular following activation by
inflammatory stimuli and TLR ligands [7, 8]. IL-6 was
proposed as the underlying molecular effector for this
stroma-dependent anti-apoptotic activity. Recently, gastric
cancer-derived MSCs have been specifically shown to
promote neutrophil chemotaxis, survival, and activation
through an IL-6/STAT-3 pathway [9]. However, few data
are available concerning reciprocal interactions between
TAN and CAFs in solid and hematological malignancies.
Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) result from the malignant
transformation of germinal center (GC) B cells and are
the two most frequent B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas
[10]. Both FL and DLBCL are generally disseminated
diseases with frequent involvement of the BM that
represents an ectopic supportive cell niche where CAFs
display a specific gene expression profile (GEP) [11].
Transcriptomic signatures reflecting specific features of
tumor microenvironment were shown to predict patient
survival in FL and DLBCL [12, 13]. Phenotypic and
functional alterations of infiltrating T cells and TAM have
been described in both diseases [14, 15]. Furthermore,
stromal cells prevent lymphoma B-cell apoptosis in
vitro [16, 17] through various contact-dependent and
independent mechanisms including the production
of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) [18]. BAFF and a
proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are closely related
ligands of the TNF superfamily and have been shown to
trigger lymphoma B-cell survival through their receptors
BAFFR, TACI, and BCMA [19, 20]. Activated neutrophils
are well known producers of soluble BAFF [21] and
are supposed to trigger the survival and differentiation
of normal B cells into immunoglobulin-producing
plasma cells [22]. In addition, a novel subset of BAFFand APRIL-producing neutrophils able to stimulate
immunoglobulin class switching, somatic hypermutation,
and production by marginal zone B cells has been recently
described in spleen [23] even if these results are disputable
[24]. Whereas neutrophils are largely excluded from lymph

nodes (LN) in steady state conditions, they could enter
inflamed lymphoid organs and modulate adaptive immune
response [25, 26]. Interestingly, DLBCL TAN overexpress
APRIL in situ allowing its accumulation on tumor B cells
via proteoglycan binding [27]. Accordingly, the neutrophil
to lymphocyte ratio in blood is an independent prognostic
factor in patients with DLBCL [28]. However, despite
these promising results, functional interactions between
neutrophils and malignant B cells remain to be explored.
The potential role of TAN and stromal cells in
B-cell lymphomagenesis and the emerging field of
stroma-neutrophil interaction led us to investigate
whether these two cell subsets establish a bidirectional
crosstalk in the context of B-cell lymphomas. We have
previously demonstrated that MSCs obtained from
FL-infiltrated BM (FL-MSCs) produce higher level of
CCL2 compared to BM-MSCs from healthy donors
(HD-MSCs) in association with increased monocyte
recruitment and polarization into TAM-like cells [11].
We explored here the interplay between malignant B
cells, stroma, and neutrophils. We demonstrated that
FL-MSCs overexpressed IL-8 and triggered peripheral
blood neutrophil recruitment. Moreover neutrophils and
stromal cells cooperated to support malignant B-cell
growth, owing to both a protection of neutrophils from
spontaneous apoptosis, and an activation of stromal cells
that acquired an inflammatory lymphoid stroma phenotype
in contact with neutrophils. Finally, this crosstalk was
associated with an activation of NF-κB pathway in stromal
cells that sensitize neutrophils to neutrophil extracellular
trap (NET) formation.

Results
Neutrophils directly sustain malignant B-cell
growth
We first decided to test whether neutrophils directly
modified the growth of GC-derived lymphoma B-cell
lines. Purified resting neutrophils did not display any
cytotoxic effect towards malignant B cells but were
conversely able to reverse serum deprivation-induced
growth arrest of RL and SUDHL4 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained with
DOHH2 (data not shown). This supportive effect was
associated with a decreased B-cell apoptosis (Figure 1B).
Interestingly, separation of B cells and neutrophils by a
0.4-µm transwell filter completely abrogated lymphomapromoting activity of neutrophils, indicating a key
role for direct cell contact (Figure 1C). In agreement,
whereas RL and SUDHL4 expressed BAFFR, TACI,
BCMA and the APRIL co-receptor syndecan-4, addition
of soluble BAFF or APRIL did not increase malignant
B-cell growth (data not shown). However, circulating

neutrophils, unlike malignant B cells, constitutively
express significant amounts of TNFRSF13B/BAFF and
TNFRSF13/APRIL (Figure 1D) and, in our co-culture
experiments, simultaneous blockade of BAFF and APRIL
activity by TACI-Fc significantly reduced the malignant
B-cell supportive effect of neutrophils suggesting a role
for membrane-bound molecules (Figure 1E). Finally,
we explored the direct effect of neutrophils on primary
malignant B cells obtained from FL and DLBCL including
the two major molecular subtypes have been defined in
this disease, the GC B cell-like (GCB) and the non-GCB
DLBCL that differ by their response to chemotherapy and
cure rate [29]. Interestingly, we were able to confirm the
survival effect of neutrophils on B cells purified from 2
GCB and 2 non-GCB DLBCL samples, but not on 4 FL
samples (Figure 1F).
To further investigate this discrepancy, and
since APRIL-expressing TAN have been described as
intermingled with DLBCL B cells [27], we decided to
check by immunofluorescence the presence of neutrophils
in invaded FL LN compared to chronically inflamed
tonsils. The number of CD15pos cells is high and rather
similar in inflamed and malignant samples. Most
importantly, neutrophils remained essentially restricted
to interfollicular and perifollicular zones, suggesting
limited direct contact with malignant B cells but potential
interactions with transglutaminase-expressing fibroblastic
reticular cells (FRC), a lymphoid stromal cell subset
recently involved in the survival of malignant FL B
cells and in the homeostasis of normal B cells [11, 17,
30] (Supplemental Figure S1). Collectively, these data
demonstrated that neutrophils could directly support in
vitro DLBCL malignant B-cell growth and raised the
question of their indirect effect through the crosstalk with
lymphoid stroma in FL.

with TNF/LT, a well-known inducer of lymphoid stroma
differentiation [17], or with primary FL B cells and RL
cell line. This experiment revealed an increase in IL-8
secretion in the presence of malignant B cells (Figure 2C).
Finally, we explored the functional relevance of such IL-8
induction and pinpointed that conditioned media from
HD-MSCs treated by TNF/LT or primed by malignant B
cells recruited more efficiently purified neutrophils than
unstimulated HD-MSC supernatant (Figure 2D).
BM-MSCs were recently reported to support
neutrophil survival in vitro [7, 8]. We validated here
this result by demonstrating a significant increase in the
number of viable neutrophils after 2 to 4 days of culture in
the presence of BM-MSCs. Moreover, we extended these
data to tonsil-derived Resto stromal cells (Figure 2E).
This supportive activity was associated with a decrease
in neutrophil apoptosis (Figure 2F). Of note, similar
results were obtained with HD-MSCs and FL-MSCs
(Supplemental Figure S2). These data indicated that
although lymphoma-infiltrating stromal cells produced
higher levels of IL-8, probably in part through contact
with malignant B cells,various stromal cell subsets could
trigger neutrophil survival.

Neutrophils and stromal cells cooperate to trigger
malignant B-cell growth
Since BM and tonsil-derived stromal cells triggered
neutrophil recruitment and survival, we decided to test the
tripartite co-culture between stromal cells, neutrophils,
and B cells.
Neutrophils cooperated with both HD-MSCs and
Resto cells to promote the growth of malignant B-cell
lines (Figure 3A-3B). As previously reported, treatment
of stromal cells with TNF/LT reinforced their B-cell
supportive capacity through commitment into functional
lymphoid stroma [17]. Interestingly, combination of
neutrophils and TNF/LT-stimulated stromal cells also
improved B-cell growth compared to neutrophils or
activated stromal cells alone. Since neutrophils were not
able to directly sustain FL B-cell growth in vitro but were
found in close contact with FL lymphoid stromal cells in
situ, we tested how neutrophil/stromal cell cooperation
could favor primary FL B-cell survival. Importantly,
neutrophils increased the anti-apoptotic activity of both
resting and TNF/LT-pretreated stromal cells towards
purified FL B cells (Figure 3C), suggesting that such
crosstalk could favor the organization of a fully supportive
FL cell niche.

Infiltrating stromal cells recruit neutrophils and
protect them from apoptosis
IL-8 is the major neutrophil recruiting chemokine
and is overexpressed by malignant cells in several solid
tumors [3]. Strikingly, whereas neither GC-derived B
cell lines nor FL and DLBCL primary B cells secreted
IL-8 (data not shown), IL-8 was significantly increased
in FL-invaded BM plasma compared with normal BM
plasma (202.4 pg/mL [7.5-20.000] vs 17.9 pg/mL [7.554.2]; Figure 2A). We have previously demonstrated
that FL-MSCs displayed a specific GEP making them
a useful tool to study lymphoma-driven alterations of
stromal microenvironment [11]. As described for CCL2,
IL-8 was produced at a higher level in the supernatant
of BM FL-MSCs, known to be ectopically committed
to lymphoid stroma [11], compared with BM HD-MSCs
(Figure 2B). We next tried to evaluate whether malignant
B cells could contribute to this overexpression of IL-8
by FL-MSCs. For that purpose, HD-MSCs were cultured

Neutrophils drive stromal cells into a B-cell
supportive inflammatory lymphoid stroma
phenotype

and PGE2 (6.5-fold for MSCs and 1.9-fold for Resto
cells) than their unstimulated counterparts (Figure 5A).
They also displayed a stronger membrane expression of
CD54 (4-fold for MSCs and 6-fold for Resto cells). To
definitively conclude on the lymphoid stroma polarization
of neutrophil-primed stromal cells, we checked for
their capacity to secrete and organize a meshwork
of transglutaminase-positive fibers and to express
podoplanin/gp38, two well-described markers of human
FRCs. Neutrophil-primed stromal cells produced a dense
transgutaminase-positive extracellular reticular network
with a very similar pattern to that obtained following FRCcommitment by TNF/LT [17], and expressed high levels
of podoplanin (Figure 5B). Of note, as previously reported
after TNF/LT-mediated activation [17], transglutaminase
expression was not regulated at the transcriptional level in
stromal cells by neutrophils (data not shown). However,
PDPN was significantly induced in both MSCs and Resto
cells after priming by neutrophils (Supplemental Figure
S3B).
We next sought to determine whether these
neutrophil-primed FRC-like cells became fully competent
not only as tumor B-cell feeders, but also as organizers of
lymphoma B-cell niche. We decided to focus on monocyte
and neutrophil migration since FL-MSCs have been shown
to recruit both cell subsets more efficiently than HDMSCs. We first revealed that supernatants of neutrophilprimed MSCs and Resto cells triggered an improved
chemotaxis of monocytes and neutrophils, compared to
resting stromal cells (Figure 5C). To ascertain whether
CCL2 and IL-8 contributed to stroma-dependent myeloid
cell migration, we specifically depleted them from stromal
cell conditionned media. Interestingly, CCL2 and IL-8
depletion strongly decreased monocyte and neutrophil
recruitment, respectively.
Taken together, these results support the hypothesis
that neutrophil-primed stromal cells were engaged toward
lymphoid stroma differentiation, in association with an
increased capacity to support malignant B-cell growth and
to trigger monocyte and neutrophil recruitment.

Neutrophil half-life is short compared to that of
resident stromal cells in vivo, leading us to explore the
hypothesis that neutrophils and stromal cells established a
bidirectional crosstalk where neutrophils newly recruited
by stromal cells contributed in turn to their polarization.
Priming of stromal cells by neutrophils increased their
capacity to further support B-cell growth at a similar
level than activation by TNF/LT (Figure 4A). In addition,
neutrophils exhibited a strong activity on TNF/LTconditioned stroma, mimicking FRC lymphoid cells, and
converted them into highly powerful malignant B-cell
supportive cells.
To understand the molecular basis of this neutrophildependent priming of stromal cells, we decided to study
the GEP of both BM-MSCs and Resto cells after co-culture
with neutrophils. Importantly, no residual neutrophil, as
validated by RQ-PCR for the neutrophil specific gene
ELANE, was detected in primed stromal cell samples
after neutrophil removal. We underlined 3 signatures:
the neutrophil-primed MSC signature comprising 964
probesets (PS), the neutrophil-primed Resto signature
comprising 1152 PS, and the neutrophil-primed stroma
signature obtained by comparing the 6 unprimed stromal
cell samples to the 6 neutrophil-primed stromal cell
samples and comprising 577 PS (Supplemental Tables
S1-S3). Among the 151 PS that were simultaneously
found with in the neutrophil-primed MSC signature
and the neutrophil-primed Resto signature (Figure 4B),
134 were coordinately up-regulated or down-regulated
(Supplemental Table S4).
We next performed gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) approach based on previously published
signatures to highlight the major pathways activated by
neutrophils in stromal cells. Interestingly, neutrophilprimed MSCs and Resto cells showed signs of lymphoid
stroma polarization and inflammatory response, with a
strong activation of TNF and NF-κB signaling pathways
(Figure 4C-4H). Among the most strongly up-regulated
genes in neutrophil-primed stromal cells we selected a
set of 5 genes previously described as overexpressed
in human lymphoid stromal cells [11, 31] (Table 1) and
confirmed the significant overexpression of IL-8, IL-6,
CCL2, PTGS2/COX-2, and ICAM by RQ-PCR in both
neutrophil-primed MSCs and neutrophil-primed Resto
cells (Supplemental Figure S3A). Accordingly, we
demonstrated that stromal cells primed with neutrophils
for 3 days before neutrophil removal and maintained again
in culture for 3 days secreted significantly higher levels
of IL-8 (6.4-fold for MSCs and 3.8-fold for Resto cells),
IL-6 (2.9-fold for MSCs and 3.5-fold for Resto cells),
CCL2 (1.5-fold for MSCs and 1.5-fold for Resto cells),

Neutrophil-dependent stroma polarization is
associated with NF-κB activation and NETosis
Since the GEP of neutrophil-activated stromal
cells revealed enrichment for genes belonging to NF-κB
and TNF signaling pathways, we decided to evaluate
the role of NF-κB activation and TNF in neutrophildependent stroma polarization. We validated that TNFR1Fc completely abrogated the upregulation of IL-8 and
CCL2 induced by addition of exogeneous TNF (data not
shown). Interestingly, inhibition of IKK by wedelolactone,
unlike the specific blockade of TNFR1, strongly reduced
the neutrophil-mediated induction of IL-8 and CCL2 in
stromal cells (Figure 6A).

Moreover, neutrophils were able to convert tonsil and
BM-derived stromal cells into lymphoid stroma with
transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional features of
FRC-like cells, a property that has been only described
until now for lymphoid precursors, some mature CD4pos
T cells, and malignant B cells [17, 36, 37]. These results
suggest that non-malignant cells, in particular TAN,
contribute to the acquisition of lymphoma-specific
stroma features, as recently proposed in gastric cancer,
where neutrophils favor the transition of MSCs towards
CAF-like cells promoting gastric cell migration [9].
Conversely, as already reported for BM-MSCs [7, 8], we
confirmed that LN and BM stromal cells support survival
of neutrophils. Besides this anti-apoptotic activity, CAFs
have been recently demonstrated to activate neutrophils
in both solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies. In
particular, based on a genetically-induced remodeling of
LN stroma in autoimmune prone mice, an elegant study
has underlined how stromal cells could trigger lymphoma
transformation by increasing TAN activation [32].
Moreover, such reshaping of stroma architecture, induced
by a loss of expression of the extracellular matrix protein
SPARC, was detected in situ in early-stage FL, suggesting
that neutrophil/stromal cell/B cell tripartite interactions
take place within FL cell niche.
The molecular mechanisms of the neutrophilmediated stroma activation clearly involved NF-κB
pathway, as highlighted by the transcriptomic analysis,
and by the inhibition of CCL2 and IL-8 expression by
IKK inhibitor. It has long been assumed that NF-κB is
the central effector of lymphoid stroma differentiation in
normal and pathological settings [36]. More surprisingly,
blockade of TNFR1 did not abrogate the effect of
neutrophils on stromal cells, suggesting that other NF-κBactivating molecules could be involved. As an example,
neutrophils have been described to express functional
CD40L [23] whereas CD40 is detected on inflammatory
stromal cells [38]. However, neutrophils also induced
a strong expression of TNF in stromal cells (data not
shown) and such autocrine loop is very difficult to inhibit
by blocking antibodies. We could thus not exclude an
involvement of stroma-derived TNF in the lymphoid
stroma differentiation process. Another interesting
observation was that stromal cells sensitized neutrophils
to activation-induced NETosis. NET formation has been
associated with the capacity of neutrophils to activate
NF-κB pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B
cells [32]. It is thus tempting to speculate that NET also
contributes to neutrophil-mediated activation of NF-κB in
stromal cells. Activated platelets were recently reported
to simultaneously protect neutrophils from apoptosis and
prime them for NET through expression of HMGB1 [39].
How stromal cells favor both neutrophil survival and
extrusion of NET is a key unsolved issue.
Bidirectional crosstalk between stromal cells and
neutrophils has several tumor-promoting functional

Recently, neutrophils were reported to trigger NF-κB
activation in CD5pos B cells in a mouse model of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and this activation relied on their
capacity to undergo NETosis [32]. We thus tested whether
MSCs could influence NETosis. For that purpose, freshly
isolated neutrophils were seeded onto poly-D-lysine (a
permissive substrate for NET) and stimulated by a low
dose of PMA, a well-known NET inducer. Interestingly,
whereas MSCs did not directly promote NET formation,
they favored PMA-triggered NETosis (Figure 6B).

Discussion
In this paper, we highlighted for the first time
both direct and indirect tumor promoting effects of
neutrophils in GC-derived B-cell lymphomas, a group
of diseases in which TAN have been poorly studied even
if microenvironment is supposed to play a key role. We
first extended a previous work revealing that neutrophilderived APRIL is concentrated within DLBCL cell
niches [27] by showing that neutrophils could favor
DLBCL B-cell growth in vitro, in a BAFF/APRIL
dependent manner. We could not detect any activity of
soluble exogenous BAFF or APRIL on malignant B
cells and direct neutrophil/B-cell contact was required.
Since APRIL, unlike BAFF, requires concentration and
aggregation by heparan sulfate proteoglycans to be active
and is poorly detected in DLBCL peripheral blood samples
despite a high concentration at the TAN/B-cell interface
inside tumors [27], it is tempting to speculate that APRIL
plays a preeminent role over BAFF in this system, thus
arguing for the development of APRIL antagonist mAbs
for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas [33].
In FL samples, we could not detect a direct effect
of neutrophils on B-cell survival but neutrophils and
stromal cells cooperate to inhibit FL B-cell apoptosis.
FL-TAN exhibited essentially perifollicular localization
in close contact with FRC, raising the question of the
recruitment and role of these peritumoral neutrophils
that have been proposed as promoters of angiogenesis
in hepatocellular carcinomas [34]. Interestingly, FRC
meshwork is expanded and activated within FL-invaded
LN, and FL BM infiltration is characterized by the ectopic
development of lymphoid-like stromal cells that form
aggregates with malignant B cells [16]. The mechanisms
underlying such activation of tumor-infiltrating stroma
remain incompletely understood. We have previously
demonstrated that FL-MSCs overexpressed CCL2 in
response to B-cell derived TNF [11] and identified here
IL-8 as another marker of tumor-educated MSCs. These
data argue for a crucial role for malignant cells in stroma
activation. Of note, PGE2 is also produced at higher
level by FL-infiltrating stromal cells in LN and BM but
the mechanism of this overexpression is unknown [35].
Importantly, CCL2, IL-8, and PGE2 were all induced
by the crosstalk between neutrophils and stromal cells.

consequences. First, neutrophil-primed stromal cells
supported more efficiently the growth of malignant B
cells, a property shared with stromal cells committed
towards lymphoid stroma by TNF/LT or by co-culture
with malignant B cells [17]. We previously demonstrated
that stromal cells and macrophages synergized to promote
lymphoma cell growth [11] and our current data reveal
that such cell collaboration is also effective between
stromal cells and neutrophils. Second, neutrophil-primed
stromal cells produced high amounts of CCL2 and IL-8
that triggered monocyte and neutrophil recruitment,
respectively. Multiple lines of evidence support a role
for TAM in the biology of GC-derived lymphoma, in
particular through their capacity to produce BAFF and
IL-15 [40, 41]. A high number of STAT1pos FL-TAM
is associated with an adverse outcome [42] and STAT1
activation triggers CCR2 induction in macrophages
[43] thus favoring their recruitment by stromal CCL2.
Neutrophils could thus contribute to the stroma/
macrophage crosstalk. Moreover, CCL2, IL-8, and
PGE2 have been shown to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis
[3, 44]. Finally, neutrophils could also participate to the
development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment
in B-cell lymphomas. TGF-β is overexpressed in B-cell
lymphomas and contributes to effector memory T
cell exhaustion [45]. TGF-β is usually sequestered as
an inactive complex, and becomes activated through
enzymes and reactive oxygen free radicals, all produced
by activated neutrophils [3]. Besides IL-8, several other
ligands of CXCR2, including CXCL1, CXCL3, and
CXCL5, were induced by neutrophils in stromal cells
whereas macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)
expression was not modulated. Interestingly, CXCL5 is
also upregulated during lymphoid stroma differentiation
[11]. These chemokines could thus contribute to the
stroma-dependent migration of neutrophils that was only
partly inhibited by IL-8-depletion. Altogether, neutrophils
display a wide range of tumor-supporting activity through
their interaction with stromal cells and this crosstalk
should be considered, in addition to the previously
characterized TAM/stroma crosstalk, for the design of new
therapeutic strategies.
One of the most interesting feature of FL-TAM
is their opposite predictive value depending on the
treatment schedule. In fact, FL-TAM could favor tumor
progression but also contribute to the clinical efficacy of
antibody-based anti-lymphomadrugs [14]. Whether such
dual activity exists for lymphoma-infiltrating neutrophils
has not been precisely explored. However, besides the
well-known roles of NK and macrophages in anti-CD20
antibody activity, neutrophils have already been shown
to contribute to the antitumor efficacy of Rituximab [46]
and more recently of obinutuzumab through CD16Bdependent phagocytosis [47]. In addition, anti-CD20
IgA have been proposed as highly efficient alternative
to classical IgG1 in particular through their capacity to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trigger lymphoma cell phagocytosis by CD89-expressing
neutrophils [48]. Finally, both GM-CSF and G-CSF, two
neutrophil growth factors, have been suggested to improve
rituximab efficacy in relapsed/refractory low-grade
lymphoma patients [49, 50]. A better understanding of the
role of TAN in the intricate network of cell interactions
that drives B-cell lymphoma survival, growth, and drug
resistance/sensitivity is a highly relevant issue with
potential clinical consequences for the design of new antilymphoma approaches.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples and cell lines
Samples came from subjects recruited under
institutional review board approval and informed consent
process according to the Declaration of Helsinki. BM
aspirates were obtained from FL patients at diagnosis
and age-matched patients undergoing cardiac surgery,
tonsils from children undergoing routine tonsillectomy,
LN biopsies from FL and DLBCL patients, and
peripheral blood (PB) from adult healthy volunteers.
BM plasma were collected by centrifugation and frozen
until use. BM-MSCs and tonsil-derived stromal cells
(Resto) were obtained as previously described [11, 17]
and used for functional studies at passages 1 to 3 and 8
to 15; respectively. Peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils,
PB monocytes, and malignant B cells from frozen FL
and DLBCL biopsies were purified using whole blood
CD15 microbeads, monocyte isolation kit II, and B-cell
isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotech), respectively. Purified
cell fractions with at least 98% cell purity as evaluated
by flow cytometry were used for further experiments.
GC-derived lymphoma B-cell lines RL, SUDHL4, and
DOHH2 were obtained from the DSMZ. Classification of
DLBCL samples into GCB versus non-GCB subtypes was
performed as described [51].

Antibodies and flow cytometry
FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to
CD14, CD19, CD20, and CD66b; PE-conjugated mAbs
to CD19, CD20, CD54, and CD105; PC7-conjugated
mAbs to CD19, and CD20; and PB-conjugated mAbs to
CD15 were provided by Beckman Coulter. Alexa-647cojugated mAb to CD105 was provided by ebioscience.
Appropriate isotype-matched mAbs were used as negative
controls and all analyses were performed using a Gallios
(Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer.Cell death was checked
using TOPRO-3 or DAPI (Life Technologies) staining.
Apoptosis evaluation was performed using PE-conjugated
active caspase-3 apoptosis kit (Becton Dickinson).

B-cell growth and apoptosis

IL-8 and CCL2 depletion, 2.107 Dynabeads pan mouse IgG
(Life Technologies) were conjugated to 10 µg anti-IL-8 or
anti-CCL2 mAbs (R&D Systems) before incubation with
supernatants. Supernatants were thereafter seeded inside
a magnetic field to allow immune complex retention. We
checked by ELISA that IL-8 or CCL2 were undetectable
in corresponding depleted supernatants. Conversely, the
use of an isotype-matched control mAb did not modify
the concentration of IL-8 or CCL2. The absolute number
of DAPInegCD66bpos viable neutrophils or DAPInegCD14pos
viable monocytes was quantified using FlowCount beads
in the lower chamber after 1 and 2 hours, respectively.

After serum deprivation, RL and SUDHL4 were
seeded with low serum concentration in the presence of
purified neutrophils and/or on a confluent stromal cell
monolayer. B-cell growth was evaluated by tritiated
thymidine incorporation or by counting the number
of viable B cells using FlowCounts beads (Beckman
Coulter). B-cell apoptosis was analyzed by the use of
active caspase-3 staining. When indicated, neutrophils and
B cells were separated by a 0.4-µm pore Transwell filter
or were co-cultured in the presence of polyclonal human
immunoglobulin (Tegeline®, LFB Biomedicaments) and
TACI-Fc inhibitor (100 ng/mL, R&D Systems). Stromal
cells were pretreated with TNF-α (TNF, 20 ng/mL) and
lymphotoxin-α1β2 (LT, 100 ng/mL; R&D Systems) and/
or primed with neutrophils before washing and co-culture
with B cells. For primary lymphoma samples, purified
malignant B cells were seeded in the presence or not of
stromal cells and/or neutrophils before analysis of B-cell
death.

Purified neutrophils were cultured alone or
in the presence of stromal cells. Cell apoptosis was
analyzed using active caspase-3 staining gated on
CD66bposCD105neg neutrophils, and the number of
TOPRO-3negCD66bposCD105neg viable neutrophils was
determined each day for 4 days.

Cytokine quantification

Gene expression profiling (GEP) study

IL-8 was quantified by ELISA (R&D Systems)
in BM plasma, in the supernatants of HD-MSCs and
FL-MSCs collected at the end of passage 1, and in the
supernatants of HD-MSCs stimulated with TNF/LT or
cocultured with RL or purified FL B cells for 3 days. In
addition, we measured by ELISA IL-8, IL-6, CCL2 (R&D
Systems) and PGE2 (Cayman Chemical) levels in the
supernatants of stromal cells primed or not by neutrophils
for 3 days before neutrophil removal and additional
3-day culture period. To confirm the stromal origin of
secreted cytokines after priming with neutrophils, we
checked by RQ-PCR that the mRNA level of ELANE, the
neutrophil-specific elastase coding gene, was negative
after neutrophil removal. When indicated, inhibitors of
NF-κB pathway were used during the priming of stromal
cells by neutrophils, including TNFR1-Fc (100 ng/mL,
R&D Systems) or wedelolactone (50 µM, Calbiochem).
The dose of wedelolactone was chosen as efficient to
inhibit NF-κB signaling [52] without any cytotoxic effect
on stromal cells.

GEP was performed on 3 HD-MSCs and 3 tonsilderived Resto cells primed or not with neutrophils for 1
day (ratio 1:1.5). RNA was extracted after neutrophils
removal by extensive washes, using RNeasy Mini
Kit, (Qiagen) and the purity and integrity of RNA
were checked with the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies). We checked for the absence of residual
neutrophils by RQ-PCR for ELANE. Biotinylated cRNA
were amplified according to the IVT express labeling
protocol and hybridized on GeneChip HG-U133 Plus2
oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix). Microarray
data were deposited at NCBI GEO data set under
accession number GSE62782. Data were analyzed with
the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek). Expression signal
values and P-values were obtained for each probeset (PS)
using the Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek) after
normalization by Robust Multichip Averaging algorithm
with GC content adjustment (GC-RMA). Background
noise was decreased by eliminating PS with a low standard
deviation to mean ratio. To compare stromal cells primed
or not by neutrophils, supervised analysis were carried
out by paired Student t-test with Partek Genomics Suite
software allowing the selection of PS with absolute log2
fold change >1.2 and an adjusted P-value less than 0.05.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software was used
to determine the specific enrichment of specific gene sets
in the PMN-primed stroma signatures.

Neutrophil survival and apoptosis

Migration assays
Purified PB neutrophils or monocytes (105
cells/100µL) were added in RPMI-0.1% human serum
albumin (neutrophil migration medium) or RPMI-1% FCS
(monocyte migration medium) to the upper compartment
of Transwell chambers with 5-µm pore filters. Lower
chambers contained supernatants of stromal cells obtained
after 3 days of priming by TNF/LT, RL, or neutrophils. For

Acknowledgments

An additional set of neutrophil-stromal cell
coculture experiments was performed for validation
of GEP data and RNA was generated from resting and
neutrophil-primed stromal cells. cDNA synthesis was
performed with the Superscript II reverse transcriptase and
random hexamers (Life Technologies). For quantitative
RQ-PCR, we used assay-on-demand primers and probes,
and Taqman Universal Master Mix (Life Technologies).
Gene expression was measured using the StepOnePlus
(Life Technologies) based on the ∆Ct calculation method.
PUM1 was determined as the appropriate internal
standard gene using TaqMan Endogenous Control Assays
(Life Technologies). Quantification of TNFRSF13 and
TNFRSF13B was performed using appropriate assay-ondemand primers and probes and ABL1 as internal standard
gene in GC B-cell lines, purified CD14pos monocytes, and
purified CD15pos neutrophils. For each sample, the Ct
value for the gene of interest was determined, normalized
to its respective value for ABL1, and results were then
standardized by comparison to gene expression of a pool
of five whole tonsil cells.

(Abcam) followed by labeling with anti-mouse Alexa 488
and anti-rat Alexa 594 secondary antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch). Coverslips were mounted with
mowiol mounting medium including Sytox blue (Life

(SP5X, Leica Microsystem) equipped with a 40 x oil
objective. Digital images were processed using ImageJ
software.
For NET formation, purified neutrophils were
seeded onto slides coated with poly-D-lysine or HD-MSC
monolayer for 12 hours before stimulation for 3 hours with
20 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were fixed with
