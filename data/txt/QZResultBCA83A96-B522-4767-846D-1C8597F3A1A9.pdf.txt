BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction experienced by individuals with cancer represents an important survivorship
issue because of its potential to affect occupational, scholastic, and social activities. Whereas early efforts to characterize cognitive dysfunction primarily focused on the effects of chemotherapy, more recent evidence indicates that
impairment may exist before systemic treatment. This study characterized cognitive dysfunction before adjuvant
chemotherapy in a sample of men diagnosed with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) of the testis. METHODS: Men with newly diagnosed NSGCT were recruited after orchiectomy but before adjuvant chemotherapy.
Patients completed neuropsychological tests to assess attention, learning, language, executive function, and motor
function. Self-report measures of depression and anxiety were also administered. An overall cognitive function index
was computed for participants. Cognitive impairment was defined as a z-score of less than or equal to 1.5 on 2 or
more tests, or a z-score of less than or equal to 2.0 on a single test. RESULTS: Approximately 46% of patients
exhibited cognitive impairment at the time of assessment, which is significantly greater than would be expected considering healthy population norms (binomial test: P < .0001). Patients exhibited impairments in motor function, verbal
learning, and executive function much more frequently relative to normative expectations (binomial test: P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment in men with newly diagnosed NSGCT is unexpectedly high
before the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Efforts to track cognitive function over time and to develop effective

Cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients is receiving increased attention as a survivorship issue due to its potential to
interfere with occupational, scholastic, and social activities. Cognitive dysfunction reported during or after chemotherapy
has been labeled ‘‘chemobrain’’ by the survivorship community. However, evidence for cognitive dysfunction before
receipt of chemotherapy has been reported for patients with breast cancer,1-4 prostate,5 and small cell lung cancer.6 Recognition of cognitive dysfunction before systemic treatment has underscored the need to design longitudinal studies of treatment-related cognitive dysfunction with pretreatment baseline evaluations.1,7 Whereas many studies have concentrated
on women with cancer, men with cancer appear to be at risk for similar disease-related cognitive dysfunction.
Germ cell tumors are the most common malignancy in men aged 15 to 34 years.8 Nonseminomatous germ cell
tumors (NSGCT) are the second most common form of testicular tumor.9 They differ from seminomas in that they often
present as more advanced disease (eg, stage II and III), metastasize earlier and frequently via hematogenous route, are less
radiosensitive, and generally have a poorer prognosis.10 Fortunately, stage I NSGCT disease has been associated with
nearly 100% survival,8 while stage III disease is reported to be curable in approximately 70% of patients. Prognosis related
to location of the primary tumor (gonadal or extragonadal), extent of disease, and tumor aggressiveness is determined by
degree of elevation in the following tumor markers: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG),
and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH).

Cognitive Impairment in Men With NSGCT/Wefel et al

Given the relatively good survival of many testicular
cancer patients, it is of critical importance to understand
the nature, extent, and temporal course of disease-related
symptoms and treatment-related toxicities. Characterizing the incidence, pattern, and predictors of cognitive dysfunction in NSGCT patients before adjuvant therapy is
warranted to determine cognitive deficits, inform prospective trial designs, and ascertain proper intervention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Site and Participants
Patients were recruited from the genitourinary medical
service of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. To be eligible for study
enrollment, patients were required to meet the following
criteria: 1) newly diagnosed with NSGCT, 2) between age
18 and 50, 3) English speaking and writing, and 4) able to
provide informed consent. Patients with prior or existing
neurological illness (including closed head injury and
brain metastasis), primary extragonadal germ cell tumor,
or major psychiatric illness were considered ineligible.
Between December 1999 and December 2002, 280 consecutive patients with testicular cancer were screened, and
100 were found to meet the eligibility criteria. Seventy-six
of these men consented to the study, and 69 completed
the baseline neurocognitive assessment.
Procedures
A systematic, consecutive sampling procedure was used to
identify potential participants. Patients with newly diagnosed testicular cancer were identified from daily reviews
of clinic schedules. Research staff then thoroughly
reviewed each patient’s medical records foreligibility criteria. Eligible patients were recruited to the study after
orchiectomy but before adjuvant treatment. At the time of
study enrollment, participants completed a baseline assessment consisting of cognitive tests and self-report measures.
Similar assessments were completed 1 week following the
completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, or 3 months after
baseline assessment for participants who did not receive
adjuvant chemotherapy. The final assessment was completed 12 months after baseline assessment. The study was
approved by the institutional review board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. This study
reports the findings from the baseline assessment.
Measures
A battery of 6 neuropsychological tests designed to tap
multiple cognitive domains was administered (Table 1),

including attention, psychomotor speed, learning and
memory, language, executive, and motor function. Published normative data that adjust for age, education, handedness, and sex (where appropriate) were used to convert
raw cognitive test scores to standardized scores (z-scores;
mean ¼ 0, SD ¼ 1) to facilitate comparisons.
The self-report assessment consisted of sociodemographic variables including age, education level, race/ethnicity, marital status, and psychosocial measures.
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Centers for
Epidemiologic Studies – Depression (CES-D) scale11 and
anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAIS).12 Clinically significant symptoms of
distress (ie, depressive or anxious symptoms) were operationally defined as ratings on the CES-D 27 (raw score)
and STAIS fifth percentile. Evidence from medically ill
populations suggests the cutoff score of 27 on the CES-D;
this method provides better sensitivity and specificity
compared with other commonly used cutoffs (eg,
16).13,14 Additional psychosocial tests (eg, health-related
quality of life, social support, and sexual function) were
also administered but not included in the current analysis.

using adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals. All analyses were conducted using SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SPSS 12.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL).

Statistical Analysis
As described previously,1 an index for each patient’s
baseline overall cognitive function (OCFI) was operationally defined as impaired (OCFI-I) or not impaired
(OCFI-NI) using a 2-part criterion1: if a patient performed at a z-score of  –1.5 on 2 or more tests, or2 if
they performed  2.0 on a single test they were classified as OCFI-I. All other patients were classified as
OCFI-NI. This 2-step approach was designed to minimize the number of potential false-positive errors resulting from multiple tests and to determine the frequency
of impairment rather than low performance. In a normal,
healthy population, 1.5 and 2.0 standard deviations
below the mean correspond to performances at the seventh and second percentiles, respectively. By using curves
based on the binomial probability distribution,17 we
determined that in a battery of 6 independent tests
approximately 12% of the population will perform 2
SDs below the mean on a single measure and 5% would
perform 1.5 SDs below the mean on 2 measures. Thus,
if the rate of impairment was equal to or greater than the
upper limit of 12%, it was considered significant.
Descriptive statistics (means, medians, standard deviations, and frequencies) were generated for the sociodemographic and clinical variables. Relationships between
neurocognitive function and selected demographic and clinical variables were then examined using adjusted and
unadjusted procedures. Bivariate associations between standardized cognitive test results and measures of affective distress
and other predictors were evaluated with Pearson correlations. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the
independent effects of the predictor variables associated with
each cognitive test. Logistic regression was used to model the
relationship between OCFI and predictor variables. The
OCFI and cognitive tests were regressed on the linear combination of demographic and psychological variables. For each
cognitive outcome a final model of main effects was obtained
using stepwise selection; a cutoff of P < .05 was used to
retain variables for inclusion in the final model.
Results of the linear regression were summarized
using total variance explained by the final model, R2 values, regression estimates, and 95% confidence intervals
(CI). Results of the logistic regression were summarized

RESULTS
Sixty-nine patients with a diagnosis of Stage I (n ¼ 35;
51%), Stage II (n ¼ 23; 33%), or Stage III (n ¼ 10; 15%)
NSGCT underwent neuropsychological evaluation after
orchiectomy (mean, 44  38 days after orchiectomy) and
before beginning chemotherapy (staging information was
unavailable for 1 patient). No patient received radiation
therapy. The mean age was 31.0 (7.5) years (range,
18.5-50.7 years). On average, patients had completed
14.6 (2.7) years of education (range, 8-20 years). Ethnically, 52 (75%) patients were Caucasian, 12 (17%) were
Hispanic, 3 (4%) were African American, 1 (1%) was an
Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1(1%) was an Other.
Using the OCFI classification criteria described
above, approximately 46% of patients (32 of 69 patients;
Binomial test: P < .0001) received a classification of
OCFI-I before initiation of adjuvant therapy. Approximately 14% (10 of 69) exhibited impairment on 1 test (as
a result of having a z score less than or equal to 2.0),
whereas approximately 32% (22 of 69) exhibited impairment on 2 or more tests (as a result of having a z score less
than or equal to 1.5). Men with NSGCT exhibited
impaired dominant hand fine motor dexterity (GPD; Binomial test: P < .0001), verbal learning (HVLT; Binomial test: P < .0001), and executive function (TMTB;
Binomial test: P < .0001) significantly more frequently
relative to normative expectations (Table 2).
On self-report measures, 10% of patients (7 of 69)
reported clinically significant symptoms of depression
and 7% of patients (5 of 69) endorsed clinically significant symptoms of anxiety. Pearson correlations between
cognitive variables and mood measures revealed that
CES-D scores were significantly correlated with WAIS-R
DSymbol scores, HVLT T1-3, and TMTB (Table 3).
STAIS scores were significantly correlated with HVLT
T1-3. Chi-square analysis revealed statistically significant
relations between clinicaldepression or anxiety and OCFI
status. In addition, no other significant associations
between mood and cognitive function were detected.
In addition to depression and anxiety, the following
variables were assessed as possible predictors of neurocognitive function: age, years of education, stage of disease,
depression, anxiety, time since surgery, and specific

for other covariates, only years of education was significantly associated with OCFI status such that, for every
year less of education, the adjusted OR is 0.63 (adjusted
OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.85; P < .01).

OCFI-I criteria, was associated with fewer years of education. Across all cognitive tests, impairments were most frequent on measures of learning and memory, executive
function, and upper extremity, fine motor dexterity. After
adjusting for other covariates, years of education was
related to measures of learning and memory as well as executive function, but not upper extremity, fine motor dexterity. While measures of psychomotor speed were
associated with depression and anxiety, no other cognitive
domain was associated with affective distress. In addition,
no cognitive domain was associated with time since surgery, stage of disease, or levels of alpha-fetoprotein, lactase
dehydrogenase, human chorionic gonadotrophin, or
testosterone.
With the exception of education, many clinical (eg,
fatigue, stage of disease, surgery type), mood (eg, anxiety,
depression), and quality of life variables appear to have
limited impact on cognitive function.1,2,4,7,18-21 Given
that these factors do not seem to account for the development of cognitive impairment in this study, future investigations to explore additional biomarkers (such as
inflammatory cytokines) are indicated. Limited investigation into cytokine activity associated with testicular cancers has been conducted.22 However, an established body
of research has demonstrated the relationship between
cytokines and a variety of symptoms including cognitive
dysfunction in other cancer populations.23-26 It is also
possible that the pattern of memory, executive function,
and motor abnormalities observed in our study may be
related to a subclinical, autoimmune paraneoplastic process. Several papers have described paraneoplastic limbic
encephalitis in men with testicular cancer associated with
anti-Ma and anti-Ta antibodies.27-30 Although our consent rate was quite good (76%) for this relatively rare tumor type, the current sample derived from a large tertiary
cancer center may not be entirely representative of all
NSGCT patients. However, we believe that our findings
make an important contribution to the literature in this
population.
To date, 3 retrospective studies of cognitive function
in testicular cancer survivors have been reported.21,31,32
Gritz et al31 assessed testicular cancer survivors (seminoma
and nonseminoma) who had received mixed treatments
an average of 45 months earlier. Of these survivors, 14%16% self-reported inability to concentrate, think clearly,
and complete tasks 6 months following treatment, which
was much more frequent than either before diagnosis or
within the past month. Pedersen et al32 reported results
from a mixed sample that received either surgery alone or

194

surgery and radiotherapy, and thus are not comparable to
our study population. Schagen et al21 reported cognitive
dysfunction in 5.5% of testicular cancer survivors who
were tested a median of 3years after surgery and received
no other adjuvant therapy. There was no relationship
between cognitive impairment and fatigue, depression or
anxiety. Unfortunately, they did not present any data on
cognitive test results, so it cannot be determined which
domains of cognition were affected.
Our study found a greater prevalence of cognitive
dysfunction in men with testicular cancer after surgery
and before adjuvant therapy compared with healthy population norms. However, comparison with Schagen
et al21 is difficult because of several critical methodological
differences. The difference in prevalence likely reflects differences in the criteria used to define cognitive dysfunction, and may also reflect the use of different cognitive
tests and different assessment time points after surgery.
We determined impairment relative to healthy population
norms, thus reflecting the prevalence of impaired cognitive performance relative to each patient’s preillness level
of expected performance. In contrast, Schagen et al21
defined impairment as the lowest performing 5% of the
surgery-alone group, thereby restricting their observed
prevalence rate of cognitive impairment to 5%. Moreover,
they did not use data from healthy normal controls to
determine the degree to which these men performed
below preillness expectations. Our study also assessed
patients more acutely postoperatively. We did not detect a
relationship between time since surgery and cognitive
impairment, but because our patients were seen between
6 days and 6 months after their orchiectomy, our findings
may not be generalizable to the longer postsurgery period
in Schagen et al.21
The use of different cognitive tests by different
investigators (often in different countries), different
standardization samples, and different operational definitions of cognitive impairment has made direct comparisons between studies of cognitive function in cancer
patients particularly challenging. Recently, the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force has attempted to
reach consensus on a core approach to assessing cognitive
function that would be amenable to international comparisons.33 However, these guidelines are still in development and have not been integrated into current research
studies.
The prevalence of cognitive impairment in men
with NSGCT found in this study is unexpectedly high.
These men are generally young and in the midst of their

occupational careers, often with young families and in
social circumstances that require optimal cognitive functioning. It is important to be aware of possible adverse
effects of cancer itself on job functioning, family activities,
and other social obligations. Psychosocial support and
compensatory interventions may be necessary in a subset
of patients with especially disabling symptoms. Longitudinal studies that determine the persistence and functional
impact of these cognitive deficits, as well as predictive biomarkers, will be crucial in determining the relative contributions of the disease and various treatments to cognitive
function, and to inform intervention strategies.
