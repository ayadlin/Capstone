Abstract
The majority of tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell
death after DNA damage. Despite the loss of p53, BRCA1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity
to cisplatin, and patients with BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with
platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity
in BRCA1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired DNA damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show
that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many
settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of
BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinoma. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation
within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1,
leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms
(TAp73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces TAp73 target genes specifically in BRCA1-deficient cells, and knockdown of TAp73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on BRCA1-expressing
tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, ZEB1 binding site methylation and TAp73 expression correlate
with BRCA1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism
that supports the contribution of TAp73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy
in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. TAp73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic
target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7155–65. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancers arising in the setting of germ line mutation of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene exhibit particular
clinical and molecular features, including predominantly serous histology, a high grade suggestive of a more aggressive
malignancy, and distinct gene expression profiles (1, 2). Furthermore, these tumors exhibit mutational inactivation of p53

in up to 80% of cases (3). Inactivation of p53 is thought to
promote tumor cell survival in the face of BRCA1-dependent
defects in DNA repair (3). The unfavorable histologic
features and loss of functional p53 in BRCA1-associated
ovarian cancers initially suggested that these tumors might
be associated with chemoresistance and potentially a poor
prognosis (1). Multiple studies, however, have confirmed
that patients with BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas
in fact experience a higher response rate and a more
prolonged disease-free interval after platinum-based chemotherapy, as well as improved overall survival (3–5). In vitro
studies of human ovarian cancer–derived cell lines have
supported the view that loss of BRCA1 function is associated with selective chemosensitivity to platinum agents (6, 7).
We and others have previously shown that platinum sensitivity is associated with unrepaired DNA damage in BRCA1deficient ovarian carcinoma cells (7, 8). Nevertheless, the
specific effector pathway that mediates the response to this
DNA damage in the absence of functional p53 has not been
defined.
We have developed a murine model in which defined
genetic events induce BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas
that recapitulate the serous histology, the genetic instability,
and the DNA damage sensitivity of human BRCA1-deficient
ovarian carcinomas (8–10). We show here that BRCA1deficient human and murine ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit

selective upregulation of transactivating isoforms of the p53related gene p73 (TAp73), which is known to function as a
mediator of the DNA damage response and chemosensitivity
in many cellular contexts (11–14). We provide evidence that
this TAp73 upregulation occurs through a novel epigenetic
mechanism and that TAp73 serves as an important contributor to the platinum-induced DNA damage response and to
chemosensitivity in ovarian carcinoma, both in vitro and
in vivo. Our findings, therefore, define an epigenetic regulatory mechanism for p73 that plays a role in the clinical behavior of BRCA1-associated ovarian tumors.

Materials and Methods
Tissue culture and reagents
We (D. Xing and S. Orsulic) generated the murine ovarian
carcinoma cell lines (T1, T2, T3, TBR2, TBR5, and TBR6).
Western blot analysis was carried out to confirm the absence
of whole-length BRCA1 proteins. These lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 IU/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Invitrogen). The UWB1.289 human cell line was established
(E.M. Swisher) as described (15); reconstituted BRCA1 expression was verified by quantitative reverse transcription–
PCR (QRT-PCR). Cells were maintained in 1:1 RPMI 1640/
MEGM (Lonza) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum.
Chemosensitivity assays and antibody reagents are described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
RNA analysis, lentiviral/retroviral production, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation
QRT-PCR analysis was performed as described (13). Specific forward and reverse primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table S1. High-titer amphotrophic retroviral and
lentiviral stocks were generated by cotransfection with packaging vectors into 293T cells as described previously (13, 16).
The targeted sequences are provided in Supplementary
Table S2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out as described (16) using primers spanning different
regions of p73 intron 1 (Supplementary Table S3).
Bisulfite treatment and methylation analysis
For each cell line and tumor, 200 to 500 ng of genomic
DNA were used for bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA
Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research Corp.). The 1.6-kb intronic region upstream of exon 2 of p73 was PCR-amplified with
primer sets designed using the program EpiDesignerBETA
by Sequenom (Supplementary Table S4). After confirmation
of the desired product and quantification, methylation was
quantitated in sequenced products by measuring the height
of the C and T peaks as described (17) using Chromas
Lite version 2.01 (Technelysiun Pty. Ltd.) and was expressed
as C/(C+T) for each CpG site by averaging the forward and
reverse sequence results. Hypermethylation in clinical
samples was defined as a value equal to or greater than
the methylated fraction in BRCA1-deficient UWB1.289 cells.
Methylation status was validated in cell lines and in a representative subset of cases by HpaII/MspI digestion of

7156

unconverted DNA after PCR using primers shown in Supplementary Table S4.
Patient sample acquisition and processing
Tumor specimens were obtained from the MGH Gynecologic Tissue Repository, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and
University of Washington. Use of tissues for this study was
approved in each case by the respective institutional review
boards. Designation of tumors as BRCA1 wild-type or mutant
resulted from clinical genetic testing. RNA/DNA was isolated
from dry frozen tumor samples that had evidence of >80%
tumor volume with the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA
and Genomic DNA Miniprep kits following the instructions
of the manufacturer (Sigma). For fixed specimens, microdissection or macrodissection of tissue sections was carried out
after pathology review, and DNA was extracted using the RecoverALL Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Additional methods are detailed in Supplementary Data.

Results
Cisplatin sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient ovarian
carcinoma cells
To begin to explore the pathways contributing to chemosensitivity in BRCA1-associated tumors, we first took advantage of our established murine model of BRCA1-deficient
ovarian carcinoma (8). This model uses the RCAS avian retroviral system to infect primary ovarian surface epithelium
(OSE) cells, which express the TVA retroviral receptor transgene driven by the keratin 5 (K5) promoter (Fig. 1A; ref. 18).
To develop a model for BRCA1 loss of function, we established K5-TVA mice harboring homozygous conditional
p53lox/lox plus BRCA1lox/lox alleles. By infecting OSE cells derived from these mice with RCAS-Cre, we showed that combined loss of p53 and BRCA1 along with one additional virus
expressing the c-Myc oncogene was sufficient to induce tumors that exhibit many key features of human metastatic
BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinoma (8). Three independent
BRCA1-deficient tumor lines were derived from explants of
these tumors (TBR2, TBR5, and TBR6). As a control, we compared their phenotypic properties to three tumor lines (T1,
T2, and T3) resulting from p53 loss along with different combinations of any two of the oncogenes c-Myc, K-Ras, and
AKT, which are required for ovarian tumorigenesis in the absence of BRCA1 deletion (Fig. 1A; ref. 9).
In quantitative chemosensitivity assays, BRCA1-associated
tumor lines consistently exhibited significantly increased
sensitivity to cisplatin, but not to paclitaxel chemotherapy,
compared with BRCA1 wild-type tumor lines (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 8). The difference in platinum
sensitivity was not related to the oncogenes used to transform these cells because all three BRCA1 wild-type tumor
cells exhibited significantly reduced sensitivity relative to
BRCA1-deficient cells (Fig. 1B), and the expression of either
Akt or K-Ras in the BRCA1-deficient tumor cells did not significantly affect cisplatin sensitivity in these cells (data not
shown). As expected, chemosensitivity in BRCA1-deficient

leading to tumor formation in vivo (see text for

tumor cells was associated with substantial unrepaired DNA
damage (8). Thus, this model recapitulates the BRCA1associated chemosensitivity of human ovarian carcinomas.
To study cisplatin sensitivity in human ovarian carcinoma
cells, we tested UWB1.289 cells, which are derived from an
ovarian cancer arising in a germ line BRCA1 mutation carrier and which lack expression of BRCA1 (15). These tumor
cells are also deficient in p53 function due to an acquired
somatic inactivating mutation (15). We compared cisplatin
sensitivity in parental UWB1.289 cells stably reconstituted
with either wild-type BRCA1 or the control vector. This
reconstitution is physiologically relevant, as it substantially
restores defective checkpoint responses after ionizing radiation (15). BRCA1 reconstitution substantially abrogated
platinum sensitivity in UWB1.289 cells as assessed in a quantitative dose-response curve (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Fig. S1). Importantly, a clonogenic assay showed the same
result, confirming the increased platinum sensitivity of
UWB1.289 cells relative to their isogenic BRCA1-expressing
counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1). We then sought to
uncover the specific mechanisms involved in the response

to cisplatin. We found that cisplatin induces apoptotic cell
death in both murine and human BRCA1-deficient cells,
as evidenced by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase1 on Western blot analysis and by Annexin V staining on
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 1D; data
not shown). Given that both the murine and human cells
lack functional p53, our findings imply that cisplatin induces
cell death in BRCA1-deficient cells, at least in part through
an apoptotic mechanism that is independent of p53.
Expression of p73 and its target genes correlate with
cisplatin sensitivity in BRCA1-deficient cells
After cisplatin treatment, we observed robust induction
of the p53-regulated proapoptotic target genes Noxa,
Puma, and p53AIP1 selectively in BRCA1-deficient murine
and human cells but little or no induction in their isogenic
counterparts expressing wild-type BRCA1, even when using
cisplatin doses that cause substantial cell death in both
populations (Fig. 2A and B). These findings suggest a distinct cell death pathway in the absence of BRCA1. In particular, the p53-independent induction of these genes led

us to consider that the related p53 family member p73
might contribute to the effects of cisplatin chemotherapy,
given that p73 is a direct activator of these particular target genes (19–21). Consistent with a role for p73 in the
p53-independent DNA damage response in the specific
context of BRCA1 deficiency, we first showed that lentiviral
knockdown of BRCA1 led to the induction of p73 after
chemotherapy treatment of p53-deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). We next examined p73 expression in wildtype and BRCA1-deficient murine ovarian carcinoma cells
using an isoform-specific QRT-PCR approach to distinguish
between proapoptotic transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73)
and NH2 terminally truncated isoforms (ΔNp73). Remarkably, both murine and human BRCA1-deficient tumor lines
showed substantially higher expression of TAp73 than any
of the BRCA1-expressing lines (Fig. 2C and D). In contrast,
levels of ΔNp73 isoforms were comparable irrespective of
BRCA1 status. Taken together, these data show that loss of
BRCA1 function and platinum sensitivity correlate with
both increased TAp73 and induction of TAp73 target genes
in human and murine ovarian carcinoma.

TAp73 is required for cisplatin sensitivity in
BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells
We then sought to address directly whether TAp73 itself
is an important mediator of the response to cisplatin in
BRCA1-deficient cells in vitro and in vivo. We first ablated
TAp73 expression using lentiviral RNA interference in both
human and murine ovarian carcinoma cells and then
quantitatively assayed cisplatin sensitivity. Consistently,
knockdown of TAp73 induced significant cisplatin resistance in human BRCA1-deficient UWB1.289 cells, although
it did not affect proliferation or cell viability in the absence of cisplatin (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). This
chemoresistance was comparable with that observed in
matched BRCA1-expressing UWB1.289 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). TAp73 does not play a role in BRCA1-expressing
cells, which exhibit low levels of TAp73, as knockdown
of TAp73 had little or no effect on chemosensitivity over
a 5-log dose range of cisplatin (Fig. 3A). Similarly, knockdown of TAp73 in all three murine BRCA1-deficient ovarian
carcinoma lines using a distinct short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
construct also induced substantial cisplatin resistance,

consistently induces cisplatin resistance in BRCA1-deficient but not BRCA1-reconstituted UWB1.289 cells. Lentiviral transduction expressing a control
(Vec) or TAp73-directed shRNA (TAp73si) was followed by an MTT assay performed at 72 h after cisplatin. Error bars represent SD for representative

whereas it showed no effect in BRCA1 wild-type cells at
any dose (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3). Further supporting the specificity of these effects, TAp73 knockdown
essentially abolished cisplatin-induced Noxa expression in
the three murine BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma lines
(Fig. 3C), whereas little or no effect was observed in
BRCA1 wild-type cells (Fig. 3C). The ability of TAp73 ablation to induce resistance to cisplatin was then confirmed
in UWB1.289 cells using a clonogenic assay (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Finally, retroviral overexpression of TAp73β was
sufficient to induce significant cisplatin sensitivity in
BRCA1-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These experiments together argue that a TAp73-dependent transcriptional program is an important contributor to the
chemosensitivity pathway in BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells.
Given that a subset of sporadic ovarian cancers are
thought to phenotypically resemble tumors arising in
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (22, 23), we hypothesized that
some of these ovarian cancers would show increased expression of TAp73 in association with platinum sensitivity. To
test this prediction, we examined a series of unselected
tumors from ovarian carcinoma patients treated with
platinum-based chemotherapy after surgical resection. We
first quantitated TAp73 expression by isoform-specific
QRT-PCR in chemotherapy-responsive tumors (>6 months
recurrence-free survival, a standard clinical measure) versus
unresponsive cases (24). The two groups of patients were
otherwise well-matched for clinical characteristics, including
tumor histology, tumor grade, and stage (Supplementary
Table S5). Remarkably, we observed a mean 10-fold higher
level of TAp73 expression in responsive versus unresponsive
tumors, a finding that was statistically significant (Fig. 3D).
Thus, TAp73 expression is associated with clinical platinum
sensitivity, consistent with the data in our model systems
showing a direct role for p73 as a mediator of the cellular
effects of cisplatin-induced DNA damage.
The ZEB1 transcriptional repressor binds the TAp73
locus and represses TAp73 levels selectively in
BRCA1-expressing cells
We then sought to uncover the regulatory mechanism by
which TAp73 was differentially expressed in BRCA1-deficient
and BRCA1-proficient human and murine ovarian carcinoma
cells. Several mechanisms that may contribute to the regulation of p73 expression in tumor cells, including 5′ promoter
methylation (25), EGR-1 expression (26), and E2F1 dysregulation (27), have been identified. We detected no significant
methylation of the p73 promoter in any of our ovarian carcinoma cells, consistent with prior reports (Supplementary Fig. S4;
ref. 28). Furthermore, we did not find large differences in mRNA
or protein levels of EGR-1 or E2F family members by microarray analysis or immunoblot, respectively (data not shown).
An additional mechanism that is thought to contribute to
endogenous p73 regulation involves the transcriptional repressor ZEB1 (also known as δEF1/zfhx1a). ZEB1 is a zinc
finger and homeodomain-containing factor that binds to a
regulatory region within the first intron of the TAp73

7160

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

transcription unit and potently represses TAp73 mRNA expression (29, 30). However, we observed no consistent difference in ZEB1 expression levels between BRCA1-deficient and
BRCA1-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). To test directly whether ZEB1 contributed to p73 regulation in these
cells, we inhibited endogenous ZEB1 using lentivirally expressed shRNA constructs (Fig. 4A). Remarkably, knockdown
of ZEB1 induced a dramatic (5-fold to 15-fold) upregulation
of TAp73 in all three ovarian lines expressing wild-type
BRCA1 but had no effect on TAp73 expression in any of the
three BRCA1-deficient lines (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in human cells,
we observed a high-level induction of TAp73 after ZEB1
knockdown in reconstituted UWB1.289 cells expressing wildtype BRCA1 but no induction in parental cells lacking BRCA1
function (Fig. 4B). Thus, endogenous ZEB1 potently represses
TAp73 only in cells expressing wild-type BRCA1. These results
suggest that high levels of TAp73 observed in BRCA1-deficient
cells might be due to the loss of the repressive effect of ZEB1.
To pursue this hypothesis, we next tested whether differential binding of ZEB1 to TAp73 regulatory sequences might
explain a loss of ZEB1-mediated repression in BRCA1deficient cells. ZEB repressors contain dual zinc fingers that
bind to bipartite E boxes (CACCT and CACCTG), the orientation and spacing of which vary in different target genes (31,
32). To identify the endogenous ZEB1 binding site in murine
cells, we performed ChIP in ovarian carcinoma cells expressing wild-type BRCA1. We mapped robust and specific binding of ZEB1 to a 1-kb region within the first intron of the
TAp73 transcription unit that contains such a bipartite
E-box motif (Fig. 4C). Although significant binding of ZEB1
was consistently observed within this region in murine
BRCA1 wild-type cells, in the isogenic BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells, ZEB1 binding was reduced to background levels (Fig. 4C). Similarly, in human cells expressing
wild-type BRCA1, we observed robust and specific binding of
endogenous ZEB1 to a 550-bp region containing bipartite
E-box motifs (29, 30), yet virtually no specific binding was
detected in isogenic BRCA1-deficient cells (Fig. 4D). Taken
together, these findings show that endogenous ZEB1
represses TAp73 expression in murine and human ovarian
carcinoma cells expressing wild-type BRCA1 and that loss
of BRCA1 function is associated with a loss of ZEB1 binding
and its repressive effect on TAp73.
Methylation of the ZEB1 binding locus controls ZEB1
binding and TAp73 expression in human and
murine cells
Because ZEB repressors are thought to bind directly to DNA
(32), we asked whether chemical modification of DNA itself
(e.g., methylation) might mediate differential binding of
ZEB1 in cells expressing or lacking wild-type BRCA1. We first
examined methylation of the ZEB1 binding region in these
cells by digesting genomic DNA with either methylationsensitive or -insensitive isoschizomeric restriction enzymes
(HpaII or MspI, respectively), followed by PCR amplification.
All three murine BRCA1 wild-type lines showed hypomethylation of this locus, as assessed by the absence of a significant
PCR product after HpaII digestion (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in

all BRCA1-deficient lines, this locus was highly methylated,
and the DNA was therefore resistant to HpaII digestion. A remarkably similar pattern was observed upon analysis of
the ZEB1 binding locus in human ovarian carcinoma cells:
hypomethylation in BRCA1-reconstituted UWB1.289 cells
and hypermethylation in the BRCA1-deficient parental cells
(Fig. 5B).
To characterize the methylation of this locus in detail, we
performed bisulfite sequencing across the entire ZEB1 binding region identified by ChIP in UWB1.289 cells (Fig. 5C). This
region contains ∼20 CpG dinucleotides, and we observed
substantial hypomethylation of each CpG within this binding
region in BRCA1-reconstituted cells compared with parental
BRCA1-deficient cells (Fig. 5C), in agreement with our results
from MspI/HpaII digestion analysis in both murine and
human cells. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to hy-

pothesize that hypermethylation might inhibit binding of the
ZEB1 repressor, leading to a loss of ZEB1-mediated repression and a consequent increase in TAp73 levels.
To test this model directly, we asked whether treatment
with a 5-azacytidine (a demethylating agent) would alter
the binding of ZEB1 to this locus. We observed a >100-fold
increase in ZEB1 binding in BRCA1-deficient cells after 5azacytidine treatment compared with mock-treated cells,
as assessed by quantitative ChIP (Fig. 5D). Furthermore,
5-azacytidine treatment of BRCA1-expressing cells (which
are already relatively hypomethylated) only increased
ZEB1 binding by <2-fold (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these
data show that the binding of ZEB1 to the TAp73 regulatory region is controlled through an epigenetic mechanism
and that ZEB1 is bound and suppresses TAp73 expression
in BRCA1-expressing but not BRCA1-deficient cells.

Correlation of ZEB1 binding site methylation and
TAp73 expression with BRCA1 status and with clinical
response in primary ovarian tumors
Our findings predict that ovarian cancers arising in
patients with germ line BRCA1 mutations will exhibit hypermethylation of the ZEB1 binding site within the p73 transcription unit compared with cancers arising in patients
without such mutations. To test this prediction, we obtained
a series of such tumors that were well matched in terms of
both clinical stage and histologic subtype (Supplementary
Table S6). Bisulfite sequencing within the ZEB1 binding region showed higher methylation in BRCA1-associated tumors
than in those expressing wild-type BRCA1 (Fig. 6A). This
finding was confirmed in a subset of cases by an independent
method involving MspI/HpaII digestion of primary tumor
DNA followed by PCR as shown in Fig. 5 (data not shown).
These findings support the association of BRCA1 deficiency
with epigenetic regulation of the p73 locus in ovarian cancers
in vivo.
Recent reports have shown that one mechanism by which
both BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated ovarian cancers acquire
resistance to chemotherapy in vivo is through re-expression
of a functional protein (33–35). We therefore tested methyl-

ation of the ZEB1 binding site in patient-matched primary
and recurrent tumors, in which the primary tumor contained
only the mutant BRCA1 allele (185delAG) and exhibited no
BRCA1 protein expression, whereas the recurrent, chemoresistant tumor exhibited the expression of a wild-type sequence and detectable BRCA1 protein (35). We performed
methylation-specific PCR at the ZEB1 binding locus within
p73 (Fig. 6B) after validating that this technique correlates
with results obtained by both MspI/HpaII analysis and direct
bisufite sequencing (data not shown). Remarkably, a substantial decrease in methylation was observed in the platinumresistant, recurrent tumor relative to the hypermethylated
primary tumor (Fig. 6B). Thus, these results support our findings and provide in vivo evidence that functional BRCA1 status, which affects platinum chemosensitivity, is associated
with epigenetic regulation of the proapoptotic TAp73 locus.
Finally, we tested the association of TAp73 expression with
methylation of the ZEB1 binding locus in the entire cohort of
unselected and BRCA1-associated tumors (Figs. 3D and 6A).
Thus, we performed bisulfite sequencing across the entire
500-bp ZEB binding region, as well as QRT-PCR for TAp73.
As predicted, those tumors exhibiting hypermethylation of
this locus were more likely to express high levels of TAp73

Epigenetic p73 Regulation in Ovarian Cancer

primary ovarian cancers.

with methylation of the ZEB1

carcinomas. Bisulfite sequencing
of the entire ZEB binding region
was performed in 25 primary
tumors, and the mean fraction of
methylated CpG residues was
correlated with TAp73 expression

tumor. P value by Fisher's exact
test. D, epigenetic regulation of
ZEB-1 binding controls p73
expression. Tumors with BRCA1
pathway defects exhibit
hypermethylation within p73 intron
1, preventing ZEB1 binding and
leading to upregulation of TAp73,
which in turn induces proapoptotic
genes in response to cisplatininduced DNA damage.

(Fig. 6C). In contrast, hypomethylated tumors almost exclusively expressed low levels of TAp73, comparable with the
level expressed in BRCA1-reconstituted UWB1.289 cells.
The pattern of methylation in the tumors recapitulated that
seen in the UWB1.289 cell line (Fig. 5C), in that differences in
methylation were observed across all the CpG residues in region rather than being restricted to a few residues (data not
shown). Altogether, these findings support the view that
TAp73 is regulated through this epigenetic pathway and is
an important mediator of the response to platinum-induced
DNA damage in a subset of ovarian carcinomas (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Using murine and isogenic human ovarian carcinoma
models, we show that BRCA1 is associated with a pathway

www.aacrjournals.org

for epigenetic regulation of TAp73, which we find to be
an important contributor to chemosensitivity in BRCA1deficient tumors. Previous studies have documented that
TAp73 mediates cellular sensitivity to DNA damage in a variety of contexts (11, 12, 36, 37). Furthermore, we and others
have shown that TAp73 is activated specifically in the context of platinum chemotherapy (11, 13). We show here that
TAp73 expression is substantially increased in BRCA1deficient human and murine ovarian carcinoma cells. Treatment with cisplatin induces the proapoptotic transcriptional
target genes of TAp73 selectively in these cells, and ablation
of TAp73 promotes chemoresistance exclusively in BRCA1deficient cells and blocks induction of these target genes.
Together, these findings strongly argue that a direct, TAp73dependent effector pathway contributes to the chemotherapy
response in these cells. Further support for this concept is

provided by recent clinical studies that find a correlation between poor clinical outcome and increased expression of
mRNA for nontransactivating p73 isoforms, which are
thought to function as TAp73 antagonists, in ovarian and
other cancers (38–40).
We provide substantial evidence that upregulation of
TAp73 in BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells is mediated through an epigenetic mechanism that controls DNA
binding of the ZEB1 transcriptional repressor. The ability
of DNA methylation to block binding by a transcriptional
regulatory factor has been described in several other contexts
(41). Regulation of a transcriptional repressor such as ZEB1
through this mechanism seems less common, however, as
most described cases involve differential binding of transcriptional activators. It is also notable that methylation of
the TAp73 proximal promoter was not correlated with methylation of the intronic ZEB1 binding region, consistent with
prior reports that TAp73 promoter methylation is quite rare
in ovarian carcinomas (28). The differential regulation of
DNA methylation at these two loci is in accordance with
the emerging data from genome-wide studies that have uncovered distinct patterns of regulation in CpG-rich versus
CpG-poor regions (42). Thus, the proximal TAp73 promoter
is a CpG-rich region that is bound by polycomb factors (43)
and that exhibits a tumor-specific pattern of hypermethylation (44). In contrast, the intronic ZEB1 binding locus is a
relatively CpG-poor region that may be subject to more dynamic changes in methylation status (42). Although BRCA1
has not been previously associated with the regulation of
site-specific methylation, a putative BRCA1-regulated gene,
GADD45, has been implicated in a demethylation pathway
in zebrafish (45). However, we did not find a difference in
GADD45α or GADD45β expression between BRCA1-deficient
and reconstituted ovarian carcinoma cells, and knockdown
studies did not yield a GADD45-dependent difference
in methylation at the ZEB1 binding locus (data not shown).
It will be of interest to determine whether the ability of
BRCA1 to control the site-specific methylation that we have
uncovered is mechanistically related to its reported regulation of the facultative heterochromatin formation on the
X chromosome (46).
We show that TAp73 expression is correlated with the
clinical response in unselected ovarian cancers, and we pro-

vide evidence that TAp73 is regulated in at least some of
these tumors through the BRCA1-associated epigenetic
mechanism. These observations are consistent with data
showing that chemosensitivity of a subset of sporadic ovarian carcinomas is associated with the inactivation of a
BRCA1/2-dependent pathway that also involves the Fanconi
anemia proteins (22, 23, 47). Intriguingly, a recent report suggests that TAp73 is upregulated in cells from Fanconi anemia
patients through a ZEB1-dependent epigenetic mechanism
(48). An ongoing challenge for the field is to identify and classify the many mechanisms by which the BRCA1/2 pathway
may be abrogated during ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis.
Nevertheless, our findings do suggest that low levels of
TAp73 may identify patients who will not benefit from standard platinum-based therapy and who might therefore pursue other treatment options. Additionally, this work supports
an emerging consensus that the TAp73 pathway might represent an attractive therapeutic target (14). Thus, future targeted therapeutics that trigger p73 expression and/or
activation might be developed, thereby inducing apoptosis
or sensitizing otherwise insensitive cells to DNA-damaging
agents.
