Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells sensing and eliminating foreign, stressed, transformed, and
senescent cells through specialized surface receptors, such as NKG2D, that interacts with several virus- or stressinducible ligands, including ULBP1 and -2, which are expressed on target cell surfaces. For example, induction of
DNA damage or cellular senescence pathways in tumor cells led to upregulation of NKG2D ligands that activate
NK cells. Although, both pathways activate p53, the relationship of p53 activation to upregulation of NKG2D
ligands has not been addressed. In this study, we report that induction of wild-type p53, but not mutant p53,
strongly upregulated mRNA and cell surface expression of ULBP1 and -2, whereas expression of other NK cell
ligands was not affected. We defined intronic p53-responsive elements in these two novel p53 target genes.
Coculture of wild-type p53-induced human tumor cells with primary human NK cells enhanced NKG2Ddependent degranulation and IFN-g production by NK cells. Accordingly, treatment of certain wild-type p53expressing tumor cell lines with the p53-reactivating small molecular compound RITA resulted in upregulation
of ULBP2 mRNA and cell surface protein expression. Taken together, our findings define the involvement of p53
in the regulation of specific NKG2D ligands that enhance NK cell–mediated target recognition. One implication
of our work is that activating p53 after adoptive transfer of NK cells might constitute an effective combinatorial
strategy of NK cell–based immunochemotherapy in cancers in which wild-type p53 function is preserved. Cancer

Introduction
The transcription factor p53 plays a central role in cell-cycle
regulation, DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis (1–3).
Consistent with a prominent role as a tumor suppressor,
p53 is mutated or deleted in approximately 50% of cancers.
In the remaining tumors, p53 function is frequently impaired,
for example, by overexpression of its cellular inhibitor murine
double minute 2 (MDM2; ref. 4). Recently, it has been shown
that reactivation of p53 in mouse cancer models induced rapid
tumor regression by the induction of apoptosis or cellular
senescence depending on the tumor type (5). Furthermore, the
restoration of p53 expression in mouse liver carcinoma not

only resulted in cellular senescence of the tumor cells but also
in the production of inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of innate immune cells (6). The depletion of macrophages, neutrophils, or natural killer (NK) cells accelerated
tumor progression (6). Thus, innate immune cells, including
NK cells, play an important role in the regression of p53expressing tumors. The exact mechanism of the observed NK
cell–dependent tumor cell elimination, however, remains
unknown.
NK cell activation is determined by a delicate balance of
signals delivered by inhibitory and activating receptors (7).
Inhibitory receptors mainly recognize self-MHC class I molecules. Activating receptors, such as natural cytotoxicity receptors, NKG2D, or DNAM-1, interact with virus-, stress-,
transformation-, or senescence-inducible ligands (7–9). These
ligands are normally not expressed on the cell surface of
healthy cells. Tumor cells frequently express high levels of
activating NK cell receptor ligands and low levels of MHC class
I rendering these cells highly susceptible to NK cell–mediated
lysis (10).
In humans, the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D is
expressed on NK cells and subsets of T cells, including
NKT cells, activated CD8þ T cells and gd þ T cells (11, 12).
So far, several ligands for human NKG2D including MICA, B,
and ULBP1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were identified (11, 13–17). To date,
the regulation of the expression of NKG2D ligands is only

ULBP1 and ULBP2 Are Direct p53 Target Genes

partially understood. Depending on the cell type and stress
stimulus, NKG2D ligand expression can be regulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Posttranscriptional
mechanisms include MICA/B downregulation by microRNAs
targeting their 30 -untranslated regions (18) and proteolytic
shedding of MICA/B, ULBP2, and ULBP4 from the cell surface
(19–21). Furthermore, ULBP1 expression was upregulated in
head and neck squamous cell cancer by proteasome inhibitors
(22). ULBP1–3 expression was enhanced in epithelial tumor
cells upon treatment with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)
inhibitors (23). In addition, heat shock factor 1 enhanced
mRNA transcription of MICA/B after activation upon heat
shock (24). Several reports showed that triggering of the DNA
damage response by agents that activate ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) and ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) protein
kinases led to elevated mRNA expression of certain NKG2D
ligands (9, 25, 26). It is well established that the ATM/ATR
pathway activates p53. To date, it is unknown, whether the
regulation of certain NKG2D ligands depends on p53.
In this study, we investigated whether the transcription
factor p53 is involved in the regulation of human NKG2D
ligands. Here, we show that the induction of wild-type (wt)
p53, but not mutant (mut)p53, in the p53-null non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H1299, resulted in pronounced
selective upregulation of the human NKG2D ligands ULBP1
and -2 leading to NK cell activation. Furthermore, our study
shows that ULBP1 and -2 are direct p53 target genes. Finally, the
treatment of certain cancer cells with the small molecular
compound, RITA (Reactivation of p53 and Induction of Tumor
cell Apoptosis) that reactivates wtp53 resulted in the upregulation of ULBP2 expression. Thus, our study uncovers a novel
mechanism of NKG2D ligand regulation by p53 and might help
to design novel, more effective regimens to treat cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The NSCLC cell line H1299 carrying tetracycline-inducible
wtp53 or mutp53 (R175H, defective in DNA binding; ref. 27)
was maintained in RPMI containing 4.5 g/mL glucose (SigmaAldrich) with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (all
Invitrogen), 22 mg/mL Zeocin, and 2.9 mg/mL blasticidin (both
USBiological). For wtp53 or mutp53 induction, H1299-derived
cell lines were treated for 16 hours with 5 ng/mL or 1 mg/mL
doxycyclin (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively (27). For inhibition of
transcription, H1299-derived cell lines were treated with 10
mg/mL actinomycin D or the respective amount of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO; both Sigma-Aldrich) 10 hours after doxycycline treatment. Primary human NK cells were purified from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors by
magnetic cell separation by using the NK cell isolation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotec). NK cells were maintained for 48 hours in
RPMI containing 4.5 g/mL glucose with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% human serum (PAA), 200 U/mL human IL-2
(Chiron Corporation), and 10 ng/mL human IL-15 (Peprotech)
before they were used for coculture assays. NK cell purity was
determined by flow cytometry by gating on CD56þCD3 cells

and was higher than 95%. The osteosarcoma cell line U2OS,
the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, the colorectal carcinoma
cell line HCT116, and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line
HepG2 that all express wtp53 were cultured in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/mL glucose and 2
mmol/L L-glutamine with 10% FCS. For p53 reactivation,
tumor cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mmol/L RITA
(Cayman Chemical) dissolved in DMSO for 24 hours. In
parallel, cells were cultured with DMSO only. All cell cultures
were conducted in the presence of 100 U/mL penicillin G and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cell lines were tested
by the Multiplex cell Contamination Testing (McCT) Service of
the German Cancer Research Center within 1 month before
conducted experiments (28).
Transfection with p53 expression plasmid
For transfection, 6  105 HT1080 or U2OS cells were plated
per 10 cm dish. Twenty-four hours later, cells were cotransfected with 500 ng pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and 2 mg wtp53
expression plasmid (TP53 gene cloned in pCMV-3Tag-1; Agilent Technologies) or 2 mg vector control (pcDNA3.1þ; Invitrogen). U2OS cells were transfected with FuGENE 6
transfection reagent (Promega) and HT1080 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers’ instructions. Both transfection reagents were used at a
3:1 (reagent: DNA) ratio. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
cells were harvested for analysis of transfection efficiencies by
gating on 7-AADEGFPþ cells by flow cytometry and ULBP1/2
mRNA expression levels were determined by quantitative realtime PCR.
Luciferase reporter assay
For luciferase reporter assays, in Figure 4A and 5A, the
depicted intronic sequences of the ULBP1/2 genes containing
the potential p53REs were cloned into the pGL3-Basic plasmid
(Promega) 50 of the luciferase gene. The pGL3-Basic plasmid
contains no internal promoter. For the assays, 2  105 H1299
cells per well were plated in a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours
later, cells were cotransfected by using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) with 500 ng of the respective luciferase
reporter plasmids and 0 to 40 ng p53 expression plasmid filled
up to 500 ng with pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Each transfection also
contained 500 ng of the internal standard RSV-b-Gal plasmid
to correct for possible variations in transfection efficiencies.
Cells were harvested 18 to 24 hours after transfection by using
the Luciferase Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer from
Promega following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase
activities were quantified by using a Lucy 1 microplate luminometer (Anthos). Beta-galactosidase activity was measured by
cleavage of O-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyraniside (ONPG). For
all samples, relative luciferase activity was calculated as
luciferase activity/beta-galactosidase activity. Fold induction
was calculated by setting the relative luciferase activity of the
transfection without p53 expression plasmid as 1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, 1  107 untreated or doxycyclin-treated H1299 cells

with either wtp53 or mutp53 were harvested and processed
with the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Cell
Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The amount of input chromatin per ChIP
was 10 mg. For p53-specific ChIP, chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 2 mg monoclonal antibody (mAb) clone
1C12 (Cell Signaling Technology) or 2 mg of a respective
isotype control mAb (clone 11711; R&D Systems). The
relative amounts of chromatin immunoprecipitated by
either isotype control or a-p53 mAb was determined by
real-time PCR with the respective p53RE-specific primers
as described in the Supplementary Material.
IFN-g ELISA
H1299-derived cell lines were treated for 16 hours with
doxycyclin as described before. Subsequently, cells were harvested, washed twice, and the coculture with NK cells was set
up. A total of 2.5  105 target cells per well were incubated in a
48-well plate for 24 hours with 2.5  105 NK cells in a final
volume of 500 mL in RPMI containing 4.5 g/mL glucose with 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% human serum, and 100 U/mL
human IL-2. In NKG2D-blocking experiments, a-NKG2D
mAb (clone BAT221; Miltenyi Biotec) or isotype control mIgG1
(clone 11711; R&D Systems) were added to NK cells at a final
concentration of 10 mg/mL 30 minutes before coculture with
target cells. IFN-g release was determined by the Human IFN-g
ELISA MAX Standard Set (BioLegend) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Degranulation assay
The coculture of H1299-derived cell lines with NK cells
was done as described for IFN-g ELISA. A total of 1  105
target cells per well were cocultured in a 96-well plate for 4
hours with 1  105 NK cells in a final volume of 200 mL in
RPMI containing 4.5 g/mL glucose with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% human serum in the presence of BD GolgiStop
(BD Biosciences), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–antihuman CD107a (clone H4A3) and FITC–anti-human
CD107b (clone H4B4) or FITC–mIgG1 isotype control (clone
MOPC-21). Afterwards, cells were stained with PE–antihuman CD3 (clone HIT3a) and APC–anti human CD56
(clone HCD56) followed by staining with 7-AAD. All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend. The percentage of
CD107aþ/bþ NK cells was determined by gating on 7AADCD56þCD3 cells. Blockade of NKG2D was done as
described for IFN-g ELISA.
Statistical analyses
For the calculation of statistical significances of differences
between experimental groups, 2-tailed Student's t tests for
unpaired data were used. P values of less than 0.05 were
considered as significant.

Results
Induction of wtp53 expression in H1299 cells
upregulates cell surface expression of the NKG2D
ligands ULBP1 and -2
To investigate the impact of wtp53 induction on NK cell
ligand regulation, we used the p53 null NSCLC cell line H1299
with doxycyclin-inducible wtp53 expression (27). As control,
H1299 cells with a doxycyclin-inducible DNA-binding defective mutp53 (R175H) were analyzed. Figure 1A shows that
doxycyclin treatment induced wtp53 or mutp53 expression in
the H1299-derived cell lines. Furthermore, in wtp53-expressing cells, but not in mutp53-expressing cells, the classical p53
target gene, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, was
expressed after wtp53 induction. Importantly, induction of
wtp53, but not mutp53, in H1299 cells significantly upregulated the cell surface expression of the NKG2D ligands, ULBP1
(3.9-fold increase in MFI) and ULBP2 (5.3-fold increase in
MFI), and the binding of a NKG2D-Fc fusion protein (Fig. 1B
and C). Expression of other NKG2D ligands was not significantly changed after p53 induction (Fig. 1B and C). In addition,
expression of MHC class I, ICAM-1, NKp30-, NKp44-, NKp46
ligands, and the DNAM-1 ligands, CD112 and CD155, was not
altered by wtp53 expression in H1299 cells (data not shown).
All stainings were done upon gating on viable, 7-AAD negative
cells. On average, 80% of nonfloating cells were viable after the
16-hour doxycyclin treatment as determined by staining with
7-AAD (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate
that the reintroduction of wtp53 in H1299 tumor cells lacking
p53 expression led to a pronounced upregulation of the
activating NK cell ligands ULBP1 and ULBP2.
ULBP1 and ULBP2 are upregulated at the
transcriptional level
Next, we analyzed, whether ULBP1 and -2 were upregulated
at the transcriptional level by quantitative real-time PCR.
Indeed, ULBP1 and -2 mRNAs (relative ULBP1 mRNA levels
by 11-fold and ULBP2 mRNA levels by 20-fold) were strongly
upregulated upon induction of wtp53, but not mutp53, after 16
hours in H1299 cells (Fig. 2A and B). In a next step, we
investigated whether wtp53 induction affected the stability
of ULBP1/2 mRNA. After 10-hour treatment of wtp53 H1299
with doxycyclin, the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D
was added. ULBP1/2 mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR at different time points (Fig. 2C and D).
Blockade of transcription diminished ULBP1/2 mRNA expression levels to the same extent in nontreated and doxycyclintreated H1299 cells (Fig. 2C and D). These data indicate that
the increase of ULBP1/2 mRNA levels was not a result of
increased mRNA stability, suggesting that enhanced mRNA
levels are caused by de novo transcription. Next, we tested
whether expression of wtp53 enhances ULBP1/2 mRNA levels
in additional tumor cell lines. To this end, we cotransfected
the 2 sarcoma cell lines, U2OS and HT1080, with a wtp53 and
an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression
plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA
was isolated for quantification of ULBP1/2 mRNA levels by
real-time PCR, and transfection efficiencies were determined

shows that in both cell lines, the p53 target gene p21 was
induced on protein level by overexpression of wtp53. Notably,
relative ULBP2 mRNA amounts significantly increased in both
cell lines after wtp53 transfection, whereas ULBP1 mRNA
levels were not detectable (Fig. 2F). In summary, these data
indicate that ULBP1/2 mRNA levels increase in several tumor
cell lines after overexpression of wtp53 and that the increased
ULBP1/2 mRNA levels in H1299 cells after dox treatment are
not because of enhanced mRNA stability.

potential p53REs (TRANSFAC number: T00671) in MICA,
-B, ULBP1, -2, -3, and -4 genes by using the Transcription
Element Search System (TESS: http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/

sites of 10 bp separated by a spacer of 0 to 21 bp (29).
Potential p53REs with a suitable spacer length were only
found in the last 530 bp of the first introns of the ULBP1 and

binding of wtp53, but not of mutp53, to both p53REs in the

(Fig. 3B and C). Of note, no binding using the p53-specific
mAb on a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase

ULBP1 gene was increased by 5.2-fold and to p53RE2 by 7.6fold compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3B). In the ULBP2
gene, wtp53 binding to p53RE1 was enhanced by 3.5-fold and
to p53RE2 by 4.1-fold (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these data show
that ULBP1 and -2 mRNAs are upregulated by induction of
wtp53 in H1299 cells and that wtp53 binds to p53REs in the
ULBP1 and -2 genes.

p53RE half sites of all potential p53REs (ULBP1/2_Dp53RE1/2)
or single potential p53REs (ULBP1/2_Dp53RE1, ULBP1/

Luciferase reporter analyses showed that luciferase activity

Deletion of all potential p53REs (ULBP1/2_Dp53RE1/2) from

relatively low levels of p53 (transfection with 0–10 ng plasmid),
transfection of constructs in which the first p53RE from both
constructs was deleted (ULBP1/2_ Dp53RE1) resulted in high
luciferase activity similar to constructs containing 530 bp long
fragments of the first introns of the ULBP1 and -2 genes
(ULBP1/2). A minor effect on p53-induced luciferase activity
was observed when high amounts of p53 (transfection with
40 ng of plasmid) were present. Importantly, deletion of the
second p53REs from both constructs (ULBP1/2_ Dp53RE2)
strongly reduced luciferase activity to background levels (Figs.
4B and 5B). Thus, although p53 bound to both p53RE1/2 in the
ULBP1 and -2 genes as determined by ChIP (Fig. 3), luciferase
reporter assays revealed an essential role of ULBP1/2 p53RE2
and only a minor contribution of ULBP1/2 p53RE1 in p53induced ULBP1 and ULBP2 transcription.

amounts of a wtp53 expression vector. Eighteen hours after transfection, luciferase and b-galactosidase activities were measured. Luciferase activity was
normalized to b-galactosidase activity (set as 1) and fold induction was calculated by setting the relative luciferase activity of the transfection without p53
expression vector as 1. One representative experiment of 2 independently conducted experiments is shown. The mean of duplicates  SD is depicted.

Induction of wtp53 expression in H1299 cells leads to
their enhanced recognition by primary NK cells in a
NKG2D-dependent manner
In a next step, we investigated, whether the enhanced
expression of ULBP1 and -2 in wtp53-expressing H1299 cells
affected the IFN-g production and degranulation of primary
NK cells. Figure 6A shows that significantly higher levels of
IFN-g were produced by NK cells that were cocultured with
doxycyclin-induced wtp53 as compared with doxycyclininduced mutp53 H1299 cells. In addition, degranulation of
NK cells was significantly increased in a coculture with
wtp53-, but not mutp53-, expressing H1299 cells (Fig. 6B).
The IFN-g production and degranulation of NK cells were
significantly reduced by addition of a blocking mAb directed
against NKG2D but not by an isotype-matched control mAb
(Fig. 6C and D). Thus, wtp53-induced H1299 cells that
expressed increased levels of ULBP1 and -2 led to an
enhanced activation of NK cells in a NKG2D-dependent
manner.

The small molecular compound RITA upregulates
ULBP2 in certain wtp53-expressing cancer cells
Targeting the p53/MDM2 interaction by small molecular
compounds that reactivate p53 is a novel therapeutic strategy
for cancers expressing wtp53 (4, 31, 32). In our study, the small
molecular compound RITA (31) that reactivates p53 in different wtp53-expressing cancer cell lines was used. RITA binds
to p53 and blocks the p53/MDM2 interaction leading to p53
accumulation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cancer cells
(31). To investigate the impact of RITA on NKG2D ligand
expression, we treated 2 sarcoma cell lines, U2OS and HT1080,
and 2 carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 and HepG2, with 1 mmol/L
RITA for 24 hours and monitored ULBP1/2 cell surface and
mRNA expression (Fig. 7 and data not shown). All cell lines
expressed wtp53. Flow cytometric analyses were done upon
gating on viable, 7-AAD negative cells. On average, 80% to 90%
of nonfloating cells were viable after the 24 hours RITA
treatment as determined by staining with 7-AAD (data not
shown). RITA treatment led to high levels of p53 expression in

all 4 wtp53-expressing cancer cell lines (Fig. 7A). In addition,
RITA treatment led to induction of apoptosis in all tested cell
lines as shown by cleavage of the caspase-3 target PARP
(Fig. 7A). Importantly, RITA treatment significantly upregulated ULBP2 cell surface and mRNA expression in the 2
sarcoma cell lines HT1080 and U2OS (Fig. 7B–D). However,
RITA treatment did not alter or induce ULBP2 expression in
the 2 carcinoma cell lines HCT116 or HepG2 (Fig. 7B–D).
ULBP1 mRNA and cell surface expression were not detectable
and not induced upon RITA treatment in the tested cell lines
(data not shown). Of note, MICA/B mRNA and cell surface
expression was slightly downregulated in the majority of
experiments and expression of total NKG2D ligands, as determined by cell surface staining with a NKG2D-Fc fusion
protein, was unchanged (data not shown). These results
indicate that RITA treatment upregulates the cell surface
expression of the activating NK cell ligand ULBP2 in a subset
of wtp53-expressing cancer cell lines.

Discussion
Our study reveals a novel mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of human NKG2D ligands by p53. Our
results show that wtp53 induction in the NSCLC cell line,
H1299, resulted in a pronounced upregulation of the human
NKG2D ligands ULBP1 and -2 (Fig. 1) and led to NK cell
activation (Fig. 6). In addition, reactivation of wtp53 in 2

www.aacrjournals.org

sarcoma cell lines, U2OS and HT1080, by the small molecular
compound RITA, significantly increased ULBP2 mRNA and
cell surface expression (Fig. 7). The observed increase in
ULBP1/2 mRNA levels after wtp53 induction in H1299 cells
was not because of enhanced ULBP1/2 mRNA stability
(Fig. 2C and D). By using 2 approaches, namely ChIP and
luciferase reporter assays, we show that ULBP1 and ULBP2
are direct p53 target genes. Our ChIP analysis showed that
p53 was capable of binding to both p53REs in the ULBP1 and
ULBP2 promoters (Fig. 3). Of note, our luciferase reporter
assays revealed an essential role of the second p53REs and a
minor involvement of the first p53REs in p53-mediated
expression of ULBP1 and ULBP2 genes (Figs. 4 and 5).
Because the deletion of the second p53REs was sufficient
to reduce the p53-induced luciferase activity to background
levels, we assume that the first p53REs might only play a
subordinate role in p53-induced ULBP1/2 transcription. It
was reported that binding of p53 to p53REs is not sufficient
for transcription of p53 target genes (reviewed in ref. 29). In
this context, a recent analysis of the ULBP1 50 promoter
revealed that steady-state transcription of ULBP1 is mainly
dependent on the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 (33).
Because Sp1 and Sp3 can serve as cofactors for p53mediated transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, such
as p21Cip1 (34), it is possible that p53 also interacts with Sp1
or -3 for the efficient transcriptional regulation of the ULBP1
gene and maybe also of the ULBP2 gene.

The constructs used in our luciferase reporter assays that
contained the 530-bp long intronic ULBP1/2 gene fragments
upstream of the luciferase gene led to strong induction of
luciferase activity upon transfection with a p53-containing
plasmid. Because no additional promoter was present in our
construct, the intronic ULBP1/2 gene fragments by themselves
might work as promoters. By definition, a promoter, in contrast to an enhancer, functions in an orientation-dependent
manner. Thus, we flipped the ULBP1/2 gene fragments in front
of the luciferase gene from their 50 !30 orientation to a 30 !50
orientation and luciferase assays were carried out. Our results
revealed that the luciferase activity was not affected by flipping the orientation of the ULBP1/2 gene fragments (data not
shown). Because the ULBP1/2 p53REs have palindromic properties and do not change their core sequence with the most
conserved nucleotides when flipped, the intronic ULBP1/2
p53REs may still function as promoters that may be bidirectional. Whether p53-induced ULBP1/2 transcripts initiate at
the site of the p53REs and whether transcripts initiating at this
site encode intact proteins is currently unknown. Alternatively, the intronic ULBP1/2 p53REs may work as enhancers.
In this context, it was observed that some enhancers occasionally exhibit promoter activity in reporter assays that may
not be physiologically significant. Further analyses are needed
to clarify these issues.
Recently, it has been shown that activation of the ATM/ATR
protein kinases by DNA damage–inducing agents resulted in

the upregulation of certain NKG2D ligands including ULBP1-3
in tumor cells and normal human fibroblasts (25, 26). It is well
established that p53 can be activated downstream of ATM/
ATR protein kinases resulting in the induction of p53 target
genes. Our data indicate the involvement of p53 in the
upregulation of the human NKG2D ligands ULBP1 and 2. In
addition, in a mouse model of liver carcinoma, p53 reactivation resulted in tumor cell senescence and NK cell–dependent
tumor regression (6). The mechanism of NK cell–dependent
elimination of tumor cells was not addressed in the study. It is
possible that activating NK cell ligands such as NKG2D ligands
were induced in the tumor cells upon p53 reactivation. Of
note, by using K-ras- and c-myc–transformed p53/ ovarian
epithelial cells, Gasser and colleagues observed that the
induction of mouse NKG2D ligand expression by DNA
damage–inducing agents did not require p53 (26). We assume
that both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways
regulate the expression of NKG2D ligands after induction of
DNA damage and/or cellular senescence. It is also possible
that certain mouse and human NKG2D ligands are differentially regulated by p53. Our in silico analysis of the mouse
RAET1 genes, however, revealed potential intronic p53REs.
Future studies will investigate whether certain mouse RAE1
family members are regulated by p53 in a similar manner as
their human homologues ULBP1 and -2. In a recent study,
not only certain human NKG2D ligands but also the DNAM1 ligands CD155 and CD112 were upregulated by DNA

no effect of p53 induction was observed on the expression of
DNAM-1 ligands (data not shown), indicating differential
regulation of certain NKG2D ligands and DNAM-1 ligands
by p53.
Approximately 50% of human cancers mutate or delete p53
or impair its function to gain a proliferation and survival
advantage (4). Our study reveals that wtp53, but not mutp53,
induction in cancer cells increased the expression of certain
NKG2D ligands resulting in enhanced NKG2D-dependent
degranulation (Fig. 6). Thus, lack of p53 function might enable
cancer cells not only to promote their proliferation and
survival but also to escape from recognition by NK cells
and, possibly, other NKG2D-bearing effector cells such as
CD8þ T cells, NKT cells, and gdþ T cells by defective upre-

gulation of certain NKG2D ligands. In addition, coculture of
NK cells and wtp53-, but not mutp53-, expressing cancer cells
resulted in the NKG2D-dependent production of IFN-g (Fig. 6).
Because NK cell–derived IFN-g is important for the induction
of Th1 and Tc1 effector responses (35), lack of p53 function
might also impair the NK cell–dependent priming of T cells.
Thus, not only cancer cell intrinsic but also extrinsic, immune
cell–mediated pathways are likely to be affected by the
impairment of p53 function in tumor cells.
Targeting the p53/MDM2 interaction by small molecular
compounds that reactivate p53 is a novel therapeutic strategy
for cancers containing wtp53 (4, 31, 32). In our study, one of
these compounds, RITA (31), was used to reactivate wtp53 in
different cancer cell lines (Fig. 7). RITA treatment upregulated

cancer cell lines (Fig. 7B–D). The cancer cell lines HT1080 and
U2OS cells that upregulated ULBP2 after RITA treatment were
sarcomas. The cancer cell lines HCT116 and HepG2 that did
not upregulate ULBP2 were carcinomas. In this context, it was
reported that different epigenetic mechanisms repress the
expression of certain NKG2D ligands in epithelial tumor cells
(23, 36). HDAC3 repressed the expression of ULBP1–3 in
different epithelial tumors (23) and the ULBP2 promoter
was shown to be heavily methylated in the colon carcinoma
cell line HCT116 (36). Therefore, we assume that the cell type–
specific DNA methylation or histone deacetylation of the
ULBP1 or -2 promoters might determine their accessibility
to transcription factors such as p53.
Expression of NKG2D ligands on tumor cells is regulated at
different levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, and
posttranscriptional mechanisms. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that highest levels of NKG2D ligand expression could be
achieved by treatment with a combination of compounds
targeting different mechanisms of NKG2D ligand regulation.
Such a combination therapy could combine p53-reactivating
small molecular compounds with, for example, DNA damage–
inducing drugs or HDAC inhibitors. In future studies, different
drug combinations will be evaluated not only to achieve high
levels of inhibition of tumor cell growth but also to upregulate
NKG2D ligands on tumor cells resulting in NK cell activation.

Thus, NKG2D ligand inducing treatments including application of p53-reactivating compounds and subsequent adoptive
transfer of NK cells could be exploited as an effective regimen
of NK cell–based immunotherapy.
