ABSTRACT
The cell differentiation potential of 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) has not succeeded
in the clinical treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) so far. However, RA may also induce
the expression of resistance genes such as HOXB7 which can be suppressed by
Thalidomide (THAL). Therefore, we tested if combined treatment with RA+THAL may
inhibit growth of glioblastoma in vivo. Treatment with RA+THAL but not RA or THAL
alone significantly inhibited tumour growth. The synergistic effect of RA and THAL was
corroborated by the effect on proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines in vitro. HOXB7
was not upregulated but microarray analysis validated by real-time PCR identified four
potential resistance genes (IL-8, HILDPA, IGFBPA, and ANGPTL4) whose upregulation
by RA was suppressed by THAL. Furthermore, genes coding for small nucleolar RNAs
(snoRNA) were identified as a target for RA for the first time, and their upregulation
was maintained after combined treatment. Pathway analysis showed upregulation of
the Ribosome pathway and downregulation of pathways associated with proliferation
and inflammation. In conclusion, combined treatment with RA + THAL delayed growth
of GBM xenografts and suppressed putative resistance genes associated with hypoxia
and angiogenesis. This encourages further pre-clinical and clinical studies of this drug
combination in GBM.

development [3]. Owing to its properties as an inducer of
differentiation [4, 5] it has been assumed that treatment
with RA may lead to less malignant behaviour and thus
improved clinical outcome in GBM. However, in spite of
promising experimental evidence on its activity in vitro
[6] treatment of GBM patients with RA mostly failed
to show the expected benefit in clinical settings [7, 8].
The causes for the lack of a therapeutic effect of RA are
not well understood, but it has been presumed that the
effectiveness of RA is limited due to its fast metabolism,
decreased expression of retinoic acid receptor-β (RAR-β)
[9], or methylation and thus silencing of the RAR-β

INTRODUCTION
Despite considerable advances in understanding the
molecular biology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),
and in developing new targeted therapies [1], the prognosis
of patients with this aggressive, incurable disease remains
poor. Since invariably tumours recur resulting in a median
survival time of 14.6 months even with the best current
treatment [2] new therapeutic approaches are urgently
needed.
13-cis Retinoic Acid (RA) is a metabolite of Vitamin
A which plays a fundamental role in normal embryological

promoter [10]. On the other hand, treatment of the human
GBM cell line U343 with RA induced expression of
different genes (HOXB7, FGF2, VEGF, and IL-8) that
may contribute to tumour cell proliferation, hypoxia, and
angiogenesis, thereby potentially limiting the therapeutic
efficacy of RA [11]. However, induction of HOXB7
and FGF2 was suppressed when RA-treatment was
combined with thalidomide (THAL) [11, 12]. THAL is
an immunomodulatory drug which has been approved
for treatment of multiple myeloma. Based on its antiangiogenic effects it has been hypothesized, that THAL
might also show antineoplastic effects in clinical settings
[13]. However, treatment with THAL mostly failed to
show any influence on the course of disease in patients
with various solid tumours including GBM [14].
Based on the fact that expression of several genes
which are induced by RA may be inhibited by THAL
we propose that combination treatment with THAL
and RA may suppress the undesirable effects of RA
monotherapy and lead to improved tumor response. Thus,
the purpose of the present study was to determine the
effect of monotherapies with RA or THAL as well as the
combination therapy in mice bearing U251 human GBM
xenografts. To study possible mechanisms involved in the
interaction of both substances on transcriptional control,
expression of various genes in the tumour tissues was
studied. We found that neither of the two monotherapies
influenced growth of U251 human GBM xenografts
whereas combined treatment with the two agents
significantly delayed tumour growth. Gene expression
analysis showed no effect of these compounds on
HOXB7 in tumours excised after the end of the treatment.
However, among the genes upregulated by RA, THAL
suppressed the upregulation of IL-8, IGFBP-3, HILPDA,
and ANGPTL4 which are associated with hypoxia and
angiogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that treatment
with RA as a sole compound or in combination with
THAL caused upregulation of genes encoding small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA), indicating that snoRNAs may
be important transcriptional targets of RA in GBM.

the microscope. RA was found to inhibit proliferation
in U251 and U343 cells while THAL showed no effect.
THAL in combination with RA showed a sensitizing effect
resulting in a reduction of the cell density relative to RA
alone (Figure 1B, 1C). Of note, the cell size was observed
to be increased after 8–10 days of treatment with RA, and
in particular with RA+THAL (not shown).
Since RA was previously shown to upregulate
HOXB7 expression, and upregulation could be suppressed
by THAL, we tested the expression of this gene in tumours
excised at the end of the 18-day treatment period. No
upregulation was detected in tumours treated with RA,
although a non-significant trend (P = 0.13) for a minor
downregulation was detected for tumours treated with
THAL alone or in combination with RA (Supplementary
Figure). However, this result does not exclude a transient
effect earlier during treatment that might have disappeared
by the time when RNA was isolated. In order to explore
alternative genes associated with the effect of combined
RA + THAL treatment on tumour growth, microarray
analysis was performed.
Owing to the small number of tumours available
for analysis, significance levels were generally modest.
Nevertheless, based on the hypothesis that RA induces
expression of genes that compromise the anti-tumour
effect of RA, genes suppressing RA-induced upregulation
were filtered. IL-8 showed the strongest (10-fold) mean
suppression (P = 0.037, n = 3) by the combined treatment
RA+THAL relative to induction by RA alone. Among
the top-20 genes with the strongest suppression of RAupregulated genes by THAL, the three genes with the
highest significance scores were HILPDA (2.3-fold,
P = 0.0017, n = 3), IGFBP3 (1.9-fold, P = 0.0006,
n = 3), and ANGPTL4 (1.5-fold, P = 0.0002, n = 3). In
order to validate the differential expression, real-time PCR
was performed. Although high-quality RNA was available
only for two tumours per treatment (three for the controls)
at the time of the assay, upregulation by RA was validated
for all four genes and THAL downregulated the genes by
approximately the same fold reduction. This supports the
hypothesis that THAL suppresses RA-induced expression
of these genes (Figure 2A, 2B).
While THAL may prevent upregulation of certain
RA target genes, we looked for other genes that might
be differentially expressed after combined RA + THAL
treatment relative to single treatment with RA or THAL.
Tumours treated with RA alone showed >1.5-fold
upregulation of 80 genes and >1.5-fold downregulation
of 12 genes compared with untreated control tumours.
Interestingly, genes coding for small nucleolar RNA
(snoRNA) were greatly overrepresented among up- but
not downregulated genes (Figure 3A). Thus approximately
half of the 214 snoRNAs on the microarray chip were
upregulated while very few were downregulated.
Tumours treated with THAL alone showed >1.5-fold
upregulation of 20 genes and >1.5-fold downregulation

RESULTS
The treatment with RA and THAL, as sole agents
or in the combination, was well tolerated. No side effects
were observed. The weight of all animals remained
constant for the whole experimental period (data not
shown). Treatment with RA or THAL as sole agents, did
not affect the tumour growth in comparison to untreated
controls. By contrast, combined treatment of RA and
THAL significantly reduced tumour growth compared to
untreated controls (p =  0.0043), and treatment with RA or
THAL alone (Figure 1A).

the effect on cell proliferation in vitro was tested for the
U251 and U343 cell lines by scoring cell density under

of 9 genes. In this case, overrepresentation of snoRNA
genes involved approximately a quarter of the snoRNA
genes for upregulated genes while downregulated
snoRNA genes were observed at the same frequency as
other genes (Figure 3B).
In tumours receiving the combined treatment
RA + THAL, 21 genes were upregulated >1.5 fold and 19
genes were downregulated >1.5 fold. Further analysis of
the microarrays showed upregulation of approximately
half of the snoRNA genes (Figure 3C). Although the fold
upregulation was smaller than after RA alone, there was
an excellent correlation (R2 = 0.74) between upregulation
by combined RA + THAL treatment and RA alone
(Figure 3D). The correlations was much weaker between

snoRNA levels in THAL and RA + THAL-treated tumours
(R2 = 0.32) although a moderate correlation between
RA and THAL (R2 = 0.43) was observed. Notably, the
top-10 upregulated snoRNA in RA + THAL treated
tumours showed a high degree of overlap with the top10 upregulated snoRNA after single treatment with RA
or THAL (8 out of 10 genes in both cases; Table 1).
Comparison of the expression levels showed intermediate
levels in RA+THAL treated tumours relative to the
higher levels in RA and the lower levels in THAL-treated
tumours for most of the 14 snoRNA genes (Figure 3E).

influence of THAL-induced snoRA expression (P = 0.94;
power = 0.98 for an influence <5% that of RA).
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
showed no upregulated pathways with FDR <0.25 for
RA + THAL whereas several pathways were significantly
downregulated. A list of pathways with FDR <0.05 is shown
in Supplementary Table 1. DNA Replication, and Cell
Cycle, were among the most downregulated pathways in
RA + THAL as well as RA-treated tumours. Similarly,
Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE), and Alcoholism
were strongly downregulated with FDR <0.003 after
both treatments. The leading edge genes in the latter two
pathways was dominated by histone genes (75–95%) and
may thus reflect an effect on proliferation. Interestingly,
several DNA repair pathways showed FDR <0.05 in
RA + THAL tumours. A comparison of the normalised
enrichment score (NES) for selected pathways is shown
for pathways downregulated by RA and THAL as sole
agents (Figure 4A), and pathways upregulated by RA but
downregulated by THAL, or vice versa (Figure 4B). The
Ribosome pathway was enriched in all treated tumours
though not significantly after combined treatment.
Pathways associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication,
repair, and cell stress (FOXO), were consistently enriched
with negative scores after all three treatments. SLE
and Alcoholism pathways were enriched after all three
treatments but with positive NES in THAL and negative in
RA and RA+THAL tumours. By contrast, four pathways

DISCUSSION
In the present study we tested the influence of RA
and THAL as mono- or combination therapies on the
growth of U251 human GBM xenografts. Combined
treatment caused significant delay in tumour growth
whereas the no effect was observed for either agent on
its own. Our hypothesis was that RA administration will
induce expression of HOXB7 which should be suppressed
by THAL for combined treatment with the two drugs [11].
Surprisingly we did not observe induction of HOXB7 in
tumours treated with RA. However, RNA was isolated
at the end of treatment and it is possible that HOXB7
expression was transiently induced at earlier time points
during treatment with RA.
Based on experimental evidence that RA may
inhibit proliferation of glioma cells in a dose dependent
manner [17] and induces differentiation of various cell
types [4, 18] it has been expected that RA may have a
positive impact on the survival of GBM patients. The
mechanism by which retinoids inhibit the proliferation
of GBM cells is not well understood but it has been

shown in different glioma cell lines that the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) can be targeted by alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA). This resulted in inhibition of
autophosphorylation of EGFR and not in downregulation
of expression of EGFR [6]. In two human GBM cell lines,
T98G and U87MG, treatment with RA induced astrocytic
differentiation with upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) and downregulation of telomerase
activity [19]. The results from our in vitro experiments
confirmed that proliferation of the U251 and U343 cell
lines was inhibited by RA, which was accompanied by
an increase in cell size indicating differentiation of the
cells. In previous experiments [11] we found a higher
sensitivity of the cells to RA in clonal culture compared
with mass culture conditions. Thus differences in cell
density might contribute to the higher sensitivity to
RA observed in vitro compared with tumours in vivo.
However, in both cases a synergistic effect was observed
for the combination of THAL with RA consistent with
previous findings from a colony formation assay [11].

Therefore, it remains likely that upregulated expression
of protective genes in response to treatment with RA as
a sole agent may limit the efficacy of RA. We identified
IL8, IGFBP-3, ANGPTL4, and HILDPA, as RAupregulated genes that were suppressed by simultaneous
treatment with THAL. These candidate protective genes
are associated with hypoxia and angiogenesis which are
known to cause resistance to tumour therapy [20, 21].
As proposed in the action-reaction model [22] drug
treatment of tumour cells may cause not only the desired
effect (action) but may also induce negative effects
(reaction). In the present case, treatment with RA may
lead to differentiation of tumor cells rendering them less
aggressive but induction of resistance genes such IL-8,
HILDPA, IGFBPA, and ANGPTL4 may have a negative
impact on the neoplastic process causing stimulation
of angiogenesis and further progression. Based on the
present study, the addition of THAL in combination with
RA may abrogate the “reaction” caused by RA and lead
to better tumour response.

A considerable degree of overlap was observed: 6 of 14 genes were in the top-10 after all three treatments.

two pathways (Alcoholism, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) showed the same down-regulation in RA + THAL as in RA-treated tumours.

Multiple hypoxic areas, which normally can be
found in GBM, play a crucial role in the development
of therapy resistance and the activation of angiogenesis.
IL-8 is a member of the chemokine family which plays
and important role in gliomagenesis and angiogenesis [23]
and it has been found to be induced by RA in GBM and
neuroblastoma cell lines [11, 24]. It is highly expressed in
pseudopalisading GBM cells surrounding necrotic areas
[25] indicating that hypoxia/anoxia may be an important
stimulus for its expression [23].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IGFBP-3 is a part of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
signaling pathway [26]. In patients with newly diagnosed
GBM, elevated expression of IGFBP-3 was associated with
shorter survival [27]. In U373 GBM cells, IGFBP-3 was
identified as secretory protein under hypoxic conditions [28].
In U251 cells in vitro, IGFBP-3 knockdown significantly
diminished proliferation, motility, migration and invasive
capacity [29]. These authors also showed that exogenous
overexpression of IGFBP-3 regulates STAT-1 expression, one
of the strong predictor of poor survival in patients with GBM.
28943

Recently, it was shown that the insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor (IGF-1R), is the major receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) driving mitogenic signaling in U251 cells in vitro [30].
Interestingly, IGF-1R signaling is regulated by IGFBP-3 [31].
In neoplastic disease, Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4)
acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis, regulates
angiogenesis and promotes tumour invasion and metastasis
[32]. Hypoxia can induce ANGPTL4 by up-regulation of the
transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) [33].
In GBM LN229-vIII tumour xenografts, EGFRvIII induces
ANGPTL4 expression through the ERK/c-Myc pathway
and promotes tumour angiogenesis [34]. These findings
suggest that ANGPTL4 may be a fundamental modulator of
angiogenesis in a hypoxic tumour microenvironment.
Hypoxia inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA;
formerly known as Hypoxia-inducible protein 2, HIG2) is
also induced by hypoxia [35]. In a mouse colorectal cancer
orthotopic model, over-expression of HIG2 promoted
tumour growth by suppressing apoptosis [36]. Renal cell
carcinoma patients show increased plasma concentration of
HILPDA comparable with healthy volunteers on patients
with chronic glomerulonephritis [37]. To the best of our
knowledge, the present study is the first reporting the
expression of HILPDA in GBM.
Upregulation of a large number of snoRNA was
observed in tumours treated with RA alone. To our
knowledge, this is the first report on snoRNA as important
transcriptional targets of RA. Although expression levels
were reduced by approximately half in tumours treated with
the combination of RA + THAL, the expression was predicted
entirely by the expression induced by RA alone. Among the
ten most upregulated genes, five (SNORA20, SNORA71A,
SNORA23, SNORA3, SNORA68) were recently found to
be downregulated by HOXA10 in LN18 glioblastoma cells
[38]. Since HOXA10 expression is associated with therapy
resistance of glioblastoma [39], upregulation of snoRNA by
RA, alone or in combination with THAL, might contribute
to decreasing therapy resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy.
Pathway analysis suggested that the Ribosome pathway was
upregulated by RA or THAL as sole treatments although the
effect was reduced after combined treatment. On the other
hand, it has been reported that in multiple myeloma cells
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of bFGF was inhibited at
low concentration of THAL [40].
The upregulation of many snoRNAs may be related
to the upregulation of the Ribosome pathway since
processing of rRNA is a major function of snoRNAs
[41]. In this respect, RA and THAL showed a degree of
antagonism to each other because combined treatment
resulted in less upregulation of snoRNAs and the
Ribosome pathway than RA alone, even though both
gene sets were also upregulated by THAL on its own.
Downregulation by RA + THAL was pronounced for
pathways related to proliferation and DNA repair and
could be ascribed to RA, consistent with its differentiationinducing activity. Furthermore, THAL was responsible
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for downregulating pathways related to inflammation,
consistent with its known antiinflammatory function.
We speculate that the upregulation of snoRNAs and the
ribosome pathway may be associated with induction of
differentiation and that RA and THAL may affect different
subsets of differentiation-related genes.
In addition to the interactions between RA and THAL,
it cannot be excluded that an increase in the volume of cells
and extracellular matrix by RA-induced differentiation may
contribute to the lack of an effect on tumour volume by
treatment with RA alone. Figure 5 shows a schematic diagram
of the possible mechanisms involved in the positive effect of
combined treatment with RA and THAL on tumour growth.
Despite the lack of relevant Phase III clinical trials, it
can be concluded that treatment with RA or THAL as sole
compounds or in combination with other chemotherapeutics
or radiotherapy, showed limited efficacy in GBM patients.
Possible reasons for inefficacy of RA are discussed above.
It seems likely that efficacy of THAL requires upregulation
of certain target genes as induced by RA. In a recent
phase II multifactorial clinical study [42], GBM patients
who had completed standard radiochemotherapy with
temozolomide (TMZ) were treated in an adjuvant setting
with dose-dense (dd) TMZ combined with different, nonclassical antineoplastic drugs. Generally all treatments
were well tolerated, although high rates of lymphopenia
were observed, but patients who received RA as partly of
the combination with ddTMZ showed significantly shorter
median survival compared to other groups. In order to retain
the positive effect of standard radiochemotherapy with
concurrent and conventional adjuvant TMZ on survival,
we suggest that the growth inhibitory effect of combined
RA+THAL treatment should be explored in the adjuvant
setting by alternating RA + THAL with standard TMZ in
the weeks where adjuvant TMZ is not administered.
In summary, we have demonstrated for the first
time that combined treatment with RA and THAL delayed
growth of human U251 GBM xenografts. Mechanistically,
we observed that genes associated with hypoxia and
angiogenesis were induced by RA treatment, and that this
induction was successfully suppressed by adding THAL to
the treatment. We suggest that the combination of RA and
THAL may have a positive impact on the efficacy of RA
and survival of these patients by inhibiting RA-induced
resistance genes. To explore this hypothesis further and
to optimize treatment schedules, further pre-clinical and
clinical studies should be performed.

(Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) were dissolved in
refined sesame oil (Henry Lamotte Oils GmbH, Bremen,
Germany) immediately before administration. Animals
were randomly assigned in 4 groups with 7 to 11 animals
per group: control, RA, THAL, and RA + THAL and treated
daily (Monday-Friday) via intragastric tube with RA (30 mg/
kg), THAL (30 mg/kg) or their combination for 18 days.
Animal weight was measured daily. The tumour volume
was determined by external caliper measurement of the
greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest
transverse diameter (width). Tumour volume based on caliper

magnification. Bright-field images were used for verification.
Three independent experiments were performed.

This work was supported by grants from the German
Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and the Medical Faculty,
Alberts Ludwig University, Freiburg, Germany. We gratefully
acknowledge Ms N. Guerth and Ms M. Muciak for expert
technical assistance with real-time PCR and processing of
the microarrays, and Ms M. Bierbaum and Mr X. Mao for
technical assistance with the in vitro cell culture experiments.

Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted and purified from <50 mg
slices of snap-frozen tumours using the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis of 1 μg total RNA
was performed using AMV first strand cDNA synthesis
kit for RT-PCR (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and oligo
p(dT)15 primer according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
Affymetrix whole transcript expression analysis, a total of 1
μg of RNA was transcribed to cDNA according to the protocol
provided with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
kit (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Gene
expression profiling was performed using arrays of hugene1_0-type from Affymetrix (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Biotinylated sense-strand DNA was prepared
according to the Affymetrix standard labelling protocol and
then hybridized for 16 h. Arrays were washed and stained
using the Fluidics Station 450. Scanning was performed by
Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix High Wycombe, UK).

Statistical analysis
The growth of treated tumours relative to untreated
control tumours was tested by the t-test. The significance
of mitotic index and real-time PCR was tested by the nonparametric Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test. The relative
influences of RA and THAL on differential snoRNA
expression by RA+THAL was analysed by a linear model.
The JMP 11 Statistical Discovery software package (SAS
Institute GmbH, Böblingen, Germany) was used.
A Custom CDF Version 18 with entrez based gene
definitions was used to annotate the arrays [15]. The raw
fluorescence intensity values were normalized applying
quantile normalization and RMA background correction.
ANOVA was performed to identify differential expressed
genes using a commercial software package SAS JMP10
Genomics, version 6, from SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA). A false positive rate of a = 0.05 with False
Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was taken as the level
of significance.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), was used
to determine whether defined lists (or sets) of genes
exhibit a statistically significant bias in their distribution
within a ranked gene list (see http://www.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/for details [16]). Pathways belonging to various
cell functions such as cell cycle or apoptosis were
obtained from public external databases (KEGG, http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/) The raw and normalized data
are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database
Series accession no. GSE71224 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
