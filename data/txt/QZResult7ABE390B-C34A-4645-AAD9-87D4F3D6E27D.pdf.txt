ABSTRACT:

Autophagy inhibition is a novel cancer therapeutic strategy in the early stages of
clinical trial testing. The initial rationale for using autophagy inhibition was generated
by research revealing that autophagy is upregulated in response to external stresses,
including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Combining autophagy inhibition with
agents that induce autophagy as a pro-survival response may therefore increase their
therapeutic efficacy. Recent research has shown that some cancer cells, particularly
those driven by the K-Ras oncogene, also depend on elevated levels of autophagy
for survival even in the absence of external stressors. In multiple in vitro as well
as in vivo systems, oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation and tumor growth are
dependent on autophagy to evade metabolic stress and cell death. These studies
have subsequently led to further early phase clinical testing whether autophagy
inhibition is a viable and effective strategy for targeting Ras-driven tumors. Even
before the clinical results are available from these ongoing clinical trials, much
work remains to optimally develop the approach of autophagy inhibition clinically;
most notably reliably detecting levels of autophagy in human tumor samples,
pharmacodynamics of currently available autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine and the
derivative hydroxychloroquine), and new target identification and drug development.

Autophagy inhibition is at the forefront of cancer
therapy, with approximately 20 ongoing clinical trials in
multiple varied cancers employing this strategy as either
monotherapy or in combination with other agents [1].
The initial interest in autophagy inhibition as a cancer
therapy was generated by research revealing that some
cancers depend on autophagy for survival during external
stresses such as hypoxia, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy
[2]. A new rationale for targeting autophagy has recently
been elucidated by our group as well as several others
showing that elevated levels of autophagy are required
for cancer cells to evade lethal metabolic stress and
to maintain metabolic homeostasis, particularly in
tumorigenesis driven by the K-Ras oncogene [3-6]. Here
we will examine the evidence for autophagy addiction
as a survival strategy in Ras oncogene-mediated cancers
and how current and future therapeutic strategies aim to
exploit this addiction.
Macroautophagy (referred to hereafter as autophagy)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is a conserved, regulated catabolic cellular pathway that
degrades cellular organelles and other macromolecules
[7-8]. The process involves both non-specific and
targeted sequestration of cargo in a double membrane
vesicle (autophagosome) that fuses to a lysosome
(autolysosome), allowing for degradation of cargo and
recycling of bioenergetic metabolites [9]. Autophagy has
been shown to play a role in diverse disease processes
including neurodegeneration, atherosclerosis, and cancer
[10]. Initial research demonstrated that autophagy may
function as a tumor suppressor with defects in autophagy
predisposing to tumor development in certain mouse
models [12]. Conversely, autophagy has also been shown
to have pro-tumorigenic roles in promoting therapeutic
resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy as well as survival
under stresses such as hypoxia [2]. It is likely that the
function of autophagy in cancer is dynamic with both
protumorigenic and tumor suppressive roles which depend
on tumor stage, cellular context and tissue of origin

[11]. Recently, several groups, including our own, have
investigated whether autophagy plays a pro-tumorigenic
role in oncogene mediated malignant transformation and
subsequent tumor maintenance. Collectively the data
demonstrate that in the setting of cellular transformation,
oncogenic Ras expression leads to an increase in autophagy
and that this upregulation is necessary for survival and for
transformation. These findings suggest Ras-driven tumors
may be particularly sensitive to autophagy inhibition.
Our group has examined the correlation of autophagy
induction and oncogenic K-Ras both directly and indirectly
[3]. While exploring the notorious treatment resistance of
pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC), a tumor that nearly
universally possesses K-Ras mutations, we noted that
all human-derived PDAC cell lines examined showed
elevated basal autophagy. Autophagy was also elevated in
81% of primary PDAC tumor samples as well as in highgrade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), but
was not elevated in normal pancreatic ductal epithelium or
low-grade PanIN. Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy
with chloroquine (an antimalarial drug that inhibits
autophagosomal degradation by interfering with lysosome
pH) or genetic inhibition of autophagy in multiple
PDAC cell lines attenuated growth and tumorigenicity
in vitro as well as in vivo in tumor xenograft mouse
models. Furthermore, chloroquine (CQ) treatment of
an autochthonous K-Ras-driven genetically engineered
PDAC mouse model led to a significant increase in survival
as a monotherapy. This model has been shown by several
groups to be highly refractory to conventional treatments
as well as targeted agents [13]. Mechanistically, our
work shows that autophagy is critical for proper cellular
metabolism in these tumors. In particular, autophagy
inhibition results in a significant decrease in oxidative
phosphorylation. Together, our data provides compelling
pre-clinical evidence supporting the strategy of targeting
autophagy in the setting of an oncogenic K-Ras driven
tumor. Coincident with our studies, several other groups
have explored the relationship between oncogenic Rasinduced transformation and autophagy, further building
the case for targeting autophagy addiction, not just in
pancreatic cancers but in other Ras-driven tumors as well
(see below).
Three recent studies have shown that autophagy
is essential for oncogenic Ras-induced malignant cell
transformation [4-6]. The White lab explored the functional
rationale for autophagy induction in Ras-transformed
cells and again demonstrates a critical metabolic function
for autophagy. In a series of experiments, they show that
oncogenic H-Ras and K-Ras both upregulate autophagy
which supports cell survival and transformation primarily
through maintenance of mitochondrial metabolic
function and energy levels. The authors primarily used
immortalized, non-tumorigenic baby mouse kidney
epithelial cells in which they expressed oncogenic H-Ras
or K-Ras to levels comparable to human cancer cell lines.

Genetic inhibition of autophagy decreased cell survival
during starvation and abrogated tumorigenesis in mice.
The authors confirmed the relevance of their results to
human cancer by showing that a number of human cancer
cell lines with endogenous oncogenic Ras mutations,
including pancreatic, bladder, and lung cancer cell lines,
had a significant increase in the level of basal autophagy.
Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of autophagy in
these cell lines revealed that a number were dependent
on autophagy for cell growth, survival and proliferation.
Consistent with our studies, the authors showed a
decrease in oxidative phosphorylation as well a decrease
in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. However,
unlike in the case of our findings in pancreatic cancer, they
demonstrate a buildup of damaged mitochondria due to the
inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). They
concluded that oncogenic Ras imposes a metabolic insult
on cells that depletes energy sources thereby making the
cells dependent on autophagy to preserve mitochondrial
function for energy production and perhaps directly
provide catabolically derived metabolic substrates.
Another study explored the mechanistic link between
oncogenic Ras expression and autophagy induction. Kim et
al. used the spontaneously immortalized, non-transformed
human breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, and expressed
constitutively active oncogenic K-Ras [5]. Elevated
levels of autophagy were necessary for transformation
of these cells, as pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of
autophagy abrogated in vitro transformation and tumor
growth in immunocompromised mice. The authors also
provided evidence that oncogenic K-Ras expression
upregulated autophagy via a mechanism involving ROS,
p38 MAPK, and JNK activation. These conclusions
warrant further exploration in complementary in vitro
as well as in vivo systems, as elucidating this link could
suggest additional strategies for therapeutic intervention
to prevent the continued activation of autophagy in K-Ras
driven tumors.
A study from the Debnath lab used oncogenic
H-Ras expressing cell lines as well as several cell lines
with endogenous K-Ras mutations to show that basal
autophagy is elevated in oncogenic Ras expressing cells
grown in non-adherent conditions, and cells deficient in
autophagy exhibit decreased cell proliferation and soft
agar formation [6]. Given the reliance on autophagy for
cell proliferation, the authors tested whether autophagy
was involved in cellular metabolism. In autophagy
deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) expressing
oncogenic Ras, there was a decrease in both glucose
uptake and in glycolytic flux suggesting dependence
on autophagy for glycolytic capacity. Consistent with
other studies, including our own, autophagy appears to
be necessary for metabolism in Ras transformed cells.
However, in this case glycolysis appears to be critically
affected. These differences may reflect specifics of the
experimental system, such as the acute inhibition of
1303

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1302 - 1306

autophagy in a chronically transformed tumor cell with
CQ or RNAi versus transforming a chronically autophagy
incompetent cell, such as ATG5 null MEFs. The general
theme, however, is that autophagy induction supports
cellular metabolism in the context of metabolic stress
induced by oncogenic Ras transformation (Figure 1).
The particulars with regards to cell system and tumor
type deserve attention in the form of comprehensive
metabolomics studies. Such studies may further elucidate
targets for pharmacologic intervention.
While the majority of studies have shown that
oncogenic Ras results in elevated autophagy and this
is critical for tumorigenesis, Elgendy et al. have shown
that in some contexts oncogenic Ras expression and
autophagy activation may potentially lead to cell death
[14]. In their experimental system, the acute induction of
oncogenic H-Ras expression causes cells to undergo an
irreversible proliferative arrest and marked reduction in
ability to form colonies. The authors showed that these
cells have an increase in autophagic flux, but genetic
inhibition of autophagy in this case decreased Rasinduced death. The authors concluded that oncogenic Ras
expression leads to an autophagic cell death, which could
act to limit transformation after induction of deregulated
Ras signals. There are several key aspects of the study that
could explain the differences with the studies that have
shown that autophagy is necessary for Ras transformation.
The use of a tetracycline inducible H-Ras G12V can cause
an acute over-expression of H-Ras, which is in contrast
to stable cell lines or endogenous mutations in tumor cell
lines. Additionally, HOSE cells are not transformed by
oncogenic Ras, unlike the MEFs, MCF10A, or kidney
epithelial cells. Thus, while Ras activates autophagy in

these cells, the ultimate cellular fate by autophagy may
depend on the cellular consequence of oncogenic Ras
expression. Lastly, it is important to note that the role
of autophagy in promoting cellular death in mammalian
systems is still somewhat controversial [15] and recent
studies suggest autophagic cell death may not be a
generalized phenomenon [16].
Given the pre-clinical evidence suggesting
autophagy acts as a survival mechanism in response to
chemotherapy, multiple clinical trials have been initiated,
most studying combinations of autophagy inhibition
with both traditional chemotherapy as well as targeted
agents. Based on our pre-clinical evidence suggesting a
pro-survival role for autophagy in pancreatic cancer [3],
we have opened multiple clinical trials at our institution
for patients with pancreatic cancer. The evidence
presented above for the pro-survival role of autophagy in
oncogenic-Ras transformed cancer cell lines suggests that
other Ras-driven tumors may be particularly sensitive to
autophagy inhibition as well. Additionally, the data also
suggests that tumors with elevated basal autophagy will
be appropriate candidates for anti-autophagy therapies as
well. Determining the relevant tumor type and optimal
therapeutic combinations will be critical and a significant
amount of pre-clinical and clinical work is currently
ongoing to answer these questions.
Even before the clinical results are available from
ongoing clinical trials testing autophagy inhibition in
cancer, much work remains to optimally develop the
approach of autophagy inhibition clinically (Figure 2).
First, our methods for measuring basal autophagy or
whether autophagy is inhibited in patient samples, by
IHC and western blotting for autophagic markers, are
limited and of unproven utility in human patients. The
pharmacodynamic studies in these ongoing clinical
trials as well as in pre-clinical mouse models will be
necessary to determine whether our current drugs as well
as future compounds are achieving effective autophagy
inhibition before we can conclusively determine the
success or failure of autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic
strategy. At present, all human trials exploring autophagy
inhibition as a therapeutic strategy are using CQ or the
derivative hydroxychloroquine given the long track
record of safety in human patients. However, whether CQ
and its derivatives represent the most efficacious methods
for inhibiting autophagy is debatable. The high doses of
CQ required to achieve tumor inhibition are obtainable
in humans, but are not ideal due to the pharmacology of
the drug [17-18]. Mechanistically, CQ blocks lysosome
acidification, which is not specific to autophagy, but
may have other potentially beneficial anti-tumor effects
in addition to autophagy inhibition. There are multiple
earlier steps in the autophagy pathway that may represent
suitable targets, including the kinases Vps34, a class III
PI3K, and ULK1/2, another family of kinases involved in
the early activation of autophagy. Indeed, a recent study

evade potentially lethal metabolic stress. The green dots

showed that a small molecule, Spautin-1, promoted the
degradation of Vps34 by inhibiting two ubiquitin-specific
proteases USP10 and USP13 that regulate the stability of
the Vps34 complex [19]. By this mechanism, Spautin-1
increased cancer cell death in the setting of nutrient
deprivation when autophagy would normally act as a
survival mechanism in these metabolically stressed cells.
This compound and strategy would require significant
further pre-clinical testing before it could be employed
in humans. Given the interest in autophagy inhibition,
many other research groups are interested in developing
improved autophagy inhibitors for cancer treatment and
likewise pharmaceutical companies have also focused
their attention on autophagy inhibition as a promising
therapeutic avenue [20].
In conclusion, the studies reviewed here show that in
multiple in vitro as well as in vivo systems, oncogenic Rasmediated transformation and tumor growth are dependent
on autophagy to evade metabolic stress and cell death.

Autophagy inhibition is still in the early stages as a cancer
therapeutic strategy but future work promises to determine
whether this represents a viable and effective strategy for
targeting Ras-driven tumors. While the preclinical data in
mutant Ras tumors, in particular pancreatic cancers, is the
most developed, there are likely to be other tumor types
and driving genetic events that also exhibit autophagy
addiction. Future work from multiple laboratories as well
as results from ongoing clinical trials will allow us to
answer these and other critical questions.

Figure 2: Future directions and challenges in autophagy inhibition. A) Large scale screening of human tumor samples and

cell lines, both oncogenic Ras-driven and otherwise, for elevated basal autophagy will identify a subset of tumors that may be particularly
sensitive to autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Method development will be required to translate this aim given the limited
utility of current methods for examining human tumor samples for basal autophagy. B) Pre-clinical testing of autophagy inhibition as a
therapeutic strategy in autophagy dependent tumors will lead to future clinical trials. Pre-clinical model development, pharmacodynamics
of current autophagy inhibitory drugs, new target identification, and new inhibitor development are all important challenges facing the field
of researchers investigating autophagy inhibition. C) Ongoing and future human clinical trials employing autophagy inhibition either as
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or targeted therapy will test the utility of autophagy inhibition as a cancer therapeutic
strategy.
