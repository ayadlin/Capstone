Abstract
Despite the common usage of radiotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, outcomes
for these cancers when treated with ionizing radiation (IR) are still unsatisfactory.
A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to IR is needed to
design approaches to eliminate the radioresistant cells and prevent tumor recurrence
and metastases. Using multiple fractions of IR we generated radioresistant cells from
T2821 and T2851 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The radioresistant phenotypes
present in T2821/R and T2851/R cells include multiple changes in DNA repair genes
and proteins expression, upregulation of EMT markers, alterations of cell cycle
distribution, upregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling and elevated production of growth
factors, cytokines, important for lung cancer progression, such as IL-6, PDGFB and
SDF-1 (CXCL12). In addition to being radioresistant these cells were also found to
be resistant to cisplatin.
HSP90 is a molecular chaperone involved in stabilization and function of multiple
client proteins implicated in NSCLC cell survival and radioresistance. We examined the
effect of ganetespib, a novel HSP90 inhibitor, on T2821/R and T2851/R cell survival,
migration and radioresistance. Our data indicates that ganetespib has cytotoxic
activity against parental T2821 and T2851 cells and radioresistant T2821/R and
T2851/R lung tumor cells. Ganetespib does not affect proliferation of normal human
lung fibroblasts. Combining IR with ganetespib completely abrogates clonogenic
survival of radioresistant cells.
Our data show that HSP90 inhibition can potentiate the effect of radiotherapy
and eliminate radioresistant and cisplatin -resistant residual cells, thus it may aid in
reducing NSCLC tumor recurrence after fractionated radiotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

Adenocarcinoma (AC) is the major histological subtype
of non-small cell lung cancer. Radiotherapy (RT), either
alone or in combination with surgery or chemotherapy
is among the primary treatment protocols for NSCLC
[2–4]. Unfortunately, the therapeutic outcomes in many

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in
the United States, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
constituting more than half of all lung cancer cases [1].

cells both in vitro and in vivo studies [28]. In these
studies, we sought to determine if ganetespib would be
able to overcome radio-and cisplatin-resistance which has
developed in NSCLC cells that survived multiple fractions
of IR and radiosensitize or eliminate radioresistant residual
cells. These proofs of concept studies show that HSP90
inhibition offers a potential strategy for enhancing the
effect of radiotherapy and reducing radioresistance.

cases are not satisfactory. Tumor radioresistance leads to a
reduction in the efficiency of RT with corresponding tumor
recurrence and metastasis [2–4]. Therefore, it is important
to investigate the cellular mechanisms leading to this loss
of radiosensitivity and to discover potential therapeutic
compounds which might significantly improve the efficacy
of these treatments and prevent metastasis.
A large number of studies have demonstrated that
radiosensitivity of cells and tissues depends on many factors
such as double strand break (DSB) repair via homologous
recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining
(NHEJ), proliferation rates, radiation-induced modification
of the genes involved in cell cycle progression, and
apoptosis [5–7]. Phosphorylated histone H2AX at Ser139
(γH2AX) foci has been established as a sensitive indicator
of DNA DSBs [8]. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) has
emerged as a central component of the chromatin-based
DSB signal, acting as a mediator and an effector of the DSB
response [9]. The numbers of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci are
believed to parallel the numbers of DSBs found in the cells
[8–11]. Experimental studies on cultured NSCLC cells have
revealed that radioresistance in lung tumor cells might be
also associated with activation of other mechanisms, such
as PI3K/Akt signaling [12, 13], and JAK2/STAT3/ Bcl2/
Bcl- XL survival pathways [14]. These findings suggest that
the mechanisms of radioresistance are not regulated by a
single gene but involve complex multi-gene interactions [6].
HSP90 is a chaperone protein important in the
stabilization and trafficking of proteins (clients) involved
in cancer progression and radiation and drug resistance
[15]. HSP90 is found to be over expressed in a variety of
cancers, including lung cancer [16]. Inhibition of HSP90
results in client protein destabilization and degradation
via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Notable client
proteins include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [17],
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-3)
[18], PI3K-AKT-mTOR, DNA damage repair and cell
cycle regulation pathways [19, 20] which are essential
for cancer growth. HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG blocked
radiation-induced stabilization of HIF-1a and increased
radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells [21]. HSP90 inhibitors
are currently being developed as anticancer agents and
have shown encouraging signs of activity in molecularly
defined subgroups of solid tumors [22, 23].
Ganetespib is a unique resorcinol inhibitor of
HSP90 that is currently in clinical trials for a number of
human cancers [24]. Ganetespib has shown preclinical
activity against NSCLC models, including those driven
by mutant EGFR, rearranged ALK, and/or mutant KRAS
[4, 25, 26], and has been shown to potentiate the effect
of taxanes and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in NSCLC
models [25, 26]. Ganetespib has a manageable side
effect profile, and has demonstrated promising activity in
heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC [27].
We recently reported that ganetespib treatments had a
radiosensitizing effect in human lung adenocarcinoma

RESULTS
Establishment and characterization of T2821/R
and T2851/R radioresistant cells
T2821 and T2851 human lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines established from surgical samples [28] were used
to generate IR-resistant cell lines. T2851 cells harbor an
EGFR mutation (exon 21, L858R mutation), whereas
T2821 cells have no major known oncogenic mutations
but are a known lung AC cell line (wt EGFR, wt BRAF,
wt KRAS, no ALK fusion).
When the cells reached about 60% confluence IR
treatments were initiated. We applied multiple increasing
intensity fractions of IR. T2821 and T2851 cells were
irradiated 20 times (once a day) with the dose of 2 Gy,
then 4 times with the dose of 5 Gy and 3 times with the
dose of 10 Gy (Figure 1A). When cells reached 90% of
confluence, they were subcultured. Untreated parental
T2821 and T2851 cells were cultured under the same
conditions without irradiation. Cells were cultured in
adherent conditions in complete cell culture media
supplemented with FBS. Cells which survived multiple
fractions of IR treatment (in total, 90 Gy) were named
as T2821/R and T2851/R, respectively. T2821, T2851,
T2821/R and T2851/R cells were collected, and stocks of
the frozen cells were prepared for further study.
First, we determined plating efficiency of parental
T2821, T2851 cells and T2821/R and T2851/R cells
growing in physiologically normal conditions without
irradiation. T2821/R and T2851/R cells showed lower
plating efficiency compared to respective parental cells
(Table 1). The “classical” clonogenic survival assay was
employed to compare radiosensitivity of T2821/R and
T2851/R cells with T2821 and T2851 parental cells.
T2821/R and T2851/R cells demonstrated significantly
higher levels of the clonal survival after irradiation in
comparison with the parental T2821 and T2851 cells
(Figure 1B, 1C, and Table 1).
Next we tested the effect of cisplatin on the viability
of T2821, T2851 and T2821/R and T2851/R cells using
MTT assay. Both T2821/R and T2851/R radioresistant
cell lines also showed significant resistance to cisplatin as
compared to the parental T2821 and T2851 cells (Table 1).

differing cellular morphologies. While parental T2821 and
T2851 cells showed tight cell- cell junctions as expected

for epithelial cells, while the T2821/R and T2851/R cells
exhibited a more spindle–like morphology, and showed
a loss of cell-to cell junctions with an increase in cellular
scattering (Figure 1D). To determine whether the spindle
shape of resistant cells is associated with the epithelial- to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, we assessed
the expression of the major transcription factors involved
in regulation of EMT in lung AC cells; SNAIL1, SNAIL2
(SLUG), TWIST1, and ZEB1 [29–31]. In addition we looked
at EMT associated proteins such as N-cadherin, vimentin
and fibronectin [29, 30, 32, 33]. We found that multiple
EMT associated proteins, such as SNAIL1, SNAIL2,
TWIST1, ZEB1, N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin, are
significantly upregulated in T2821/R cells as compared to
parental T2821 cells (Figure 1E and 1G).
SNAIL2, vimentin and fibronectin were significantly
upregulated in T2851/R cells compared to parental T2851
cells, while other proteins were expressed similarly as
compared to parental T2851 cells (Figure 1F and 1G). These
data demonstrate that both IR treated adenocarcinoma cell
lines display upregulation of EMT associated proteins;
however changes in the pattern of the gene expression is
different in the two resistant cell lines.
AKT/protein kinase B is involved in radiation
resistance in NSCLC [12, 34]. We compared expression of
AKT in parental T2821 and T2851 cells and radioresistant

T2821/R and T2851/R cells cultured under physiologically
normal conditions. T2821/R and T2851/R cells express
higher levels of total AKT (Figure 2A), as well as activated
p-AKT (Figure 2B). than parental T2821 and T2851 cells.
Upregulation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is associated
with lung cancer progression [35]. EMT in melanoma and
pancreatic cancers is associated with the platelet-derived
growth factor B (PDGFBB) upregulation [36, 37]. The
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and stromal
derived factor1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), are believed to play
key roles in tolerance and acquired resistance to the
conventional therapies. These growth factors might
support survival and proliferation of tumor cells through
autocrine and paracrine mechanisms [38–42].
Therefore, we analyzed expression of STAT3
and production of the ligands IL-6, PDGFBB, and
SDF-1 along with the level of expression of their
receptors (PDGFR-beta, IL-6R, GRP130 and CXCR4)
in parental and radioresistant lung tumor cells
(Figure 2C–2H). Monensim, 2 µM, was used to block
in-situ cytokine secretion in this assay [43]. Intracellular
immunofluorescent staining revealed that T2821/R
and T2851/R cells express higher levels of STAT3
(Figure 2C) than parental T2821 and T2851 cells. While
PDGFR-beta, IL-6R, GRP130 receptors were expressed
in equal levels in parental and radioresistant cells

(data not shown). CXCR4 receptors were found to be
significantly upregulated in T2821/R and T2851/R cells in
comparison with parental T2821 and T2851 cells (Figure
2D). T2821/R and T2851/R cells produce dramatically
higher quantities of SDF- 1, PDGFB and IL-6 proteins
than parental T2821 and T2851 cells (Figure 2E–2G).
To further verify that IR- resistant T2821/R and T2851/R
cells produce higher level of IL-6 than the parental cells
(T2821 and T2851) we analyzed the concentration of IL-6
found in samples of culture media conditioned by these
cells using ELISA. As shown in Figure 2H, all four cell
lines produce very high level of IL-6, with concentration
of IL-6 in culture media samples varying from 100 ng/
ml/106 cells to more than 1000 ng/ml/106 cells. While
both parental and resistant cells produce IL-6, T2821/R
and T2851/R cells were both found to produce a
higher amount of IL-6 as compared with their parental
cells. In general, this finding is consistent with our
observations using HCS and HCA methods for detection
of intracellular cytokines (Figure 2H). The overall lower
level of IL-6 detected in the T2821 derived cells versus
the T2851 derived cells is probably associated with
different abilities of the cell lines to secret cytokines.

To compare potential cell cycle effects, parental T2821
and T2851 cells and the radioresistant T2821/R and T2851/R
cells were gamma-irradiated (0, or 5 Gy) and grown for 0,
8, 24 and 30 h after IR treatment (Figure 3). The cell cycle
distributions in control (0 Gy) cells were found to be similar
at all time points (0, 8, 24 and 30 h), therefore in Figure 3 we
present only cell cycle data for AC cells at time point 0. Cell
cycle analysis revealed G2 accumulation in IR-treated cells,
which was associated with a concomitant decreased of S
phase and G1 fraction at 8 h post-radiation, and G2 fractions
were decreased at 24 and 30 h post-radiation in each of the
parental and radioresistant cell lines.
These data suggest that radioresistance in the cells
surviving multiple fractions of IR treatment results from
differential responses to the IR treatments. While the slow
growing T2851/R cells showed only G2/M arrest after IR
treatment.

Analysis of cellular growth rates and cell
doubling times in radioresistant and parental
AC cells growing under physiologically normal
condition

To further analyze the differences between T2821/R
and T2851/R cells and their respective parental T2821
and T2851 cells, expression of DNA repair genes was
investigated (Figure 4). All cells were cultured under the
physiologically normal adherent conditions. We used a
Human DNA Repair PCR Array from SABiosciences to
compare the expression of 84 key genes involved in baseexcision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER),
mismatch repair (MMR) and double -strand break repair
(DSB R) processes. Altered gene profiles were detected
in both T2821/R cells and T2851/R cells in comparison
with the respective parental cells, with the majority of
the altered genes being up regulated (Figure 4). Higher
levels of gene upregulation were detected in T2821/R
cells as compared with T2851/R cells. Detected gene

Cellular growth rates and estimated doubling
times in parental T2821 and T2851 cell lines and
radioresistant T2821/R and T2851/R cells were
compared. The mean and standard deviation for number
of cells per well and estimation and comparison of cell
doubling times are summarized in the Table 2. T2821,
T2851 and T2821/R cells were found to have a similar
relatively high growth rates (Table 2). In contrast,
T2851/R cells had a significantly longer doubling time
than T2821 and T2851 cells (p = 0.0184 and 0.0282
respectively).

changes in T2821/R cells included upregulation of 10
genes involved in BER, NER, and DSB R processes
and downregulation of 3 genes including UNG, PRA3
and RAD51 (Figure 2A). In comparison, 6 genes were
upregulated in T2851/R cells. Surprisingly, there was
no overlap in gene changes between the T2821/R and
T2851/R cells. The highest levels of gene upregulation
were determined for the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated
(ATM) and RAD50 genes found in T2821/R cells. Levels
of ATM, RAD50, RAD51, ERCC1 and XRCC2 genes
expression that were identified by RT-PCR array were
also validated by traditional QRT-PCR. ATM, RAD50
and ERCC1 genes expression was significantly higher,
but RAD51 expression was significantly downregulated
in T2821/R cells in comparison with parental T2821
cells XRCC2 gene was expressed similarly in T2821
and T2821/R cells (Figure 4C). In contrast, T2851/R
cells express higher levels of RAD51 and XRCC2 genes,
whereas ATM, RAD50 and ERCC1 genes were expressed
similarly in T2851 and T2851/R cells (Figure 4D).

Taken together, these data indicate that multiple
changes in the expression of DNA repair genes occurred
in cells surviving fractionated IR treatment and these
changes differed between the two cell lines.

Differential response of T2821/R and T2851/R
cells to IR
To investigate, whether radioresistance in T2821/R
and T2851/R cells (confirmed by clonogenic survival data,
Figure 1B–1C) is due to higher DNA –DSB repair after
irradiation, we used fluorescence staining and HCS/HCA
methods as we described previously [28]. These techniques
allow us to evaluate the dynamics of the γH2AX and
53BP1 foci as indicators of DSBs. The γH2AX foci were
visualized as bright fluorescence spots and were found to
be present in all IR-treated cells. Control T2821/R and
T2851/R cells displayed similar levels of γH2AX foci
as was seen in control T2821 and T2851 cells (Figure
5A, 5B). IR (5 Gy) induced γH2AX foci formation at

0.2–1 h post-radiation in all tumor cells, however the
levels of γH2AX foci in T2821/R and T2851/R cells
were significantly lower when compared to the parental
T2821 and T2851 cells. Six hours post-radiation, the
numbers of γH2AX foci were reduced by approximately
1/3 of the level detected at 1 h, suggesting that by this
time most DNA repair had already occurred. The T2821/R
cells and parental T2821 cells demonstrated similar levels
of γH2AX foci at 6, and 24 hours post-radiation, while
the T2851/R cells had lower levels of γH2AX foci as
compared to parental T2851 cells (Figure 5A, 5B).
Next, 53BP1 foci were compared in parental and
radioresistant cells at different time points post-irradiation.
Both T2821/R and T2851/R cells showed lower level of
53BP1 expression in comparison with parental T2821
and T2851 cells (Figure 5C, 5D). However, T2851/R cells
showed a dramatic reduction of 53BP1 after the first 30
min post-irradiation, suggesting that T2821/R and T2851/R
cells have developed different radioresistance mechanisms.
Therefore, next we investigated the status of a few key DNA
repair proteins: pATM, pATR (ataxia telangiectasia and
Rad3-related), and RAD51 in the parental and radioresistant
AC cells after gamma-irradiation with dose of 5 Gy
(Figure 6). IR treatments resulted in upregulated pATM
expression in both parental and IR-resistant cells, however
the total amount of phosphorylated protein was significantly
lower in T2821/R and T2851/R cells than in parental T2821
and T2851 cells (Figure 6A, 6B). The levels of pATR were
lower in both T2821/R and T2851/R cells as compared with
the respective parental cells (Figure 6C, 6D).
RAD51 is a major protein involved in
homologous recombination (HR) of DNA strand breaks.
[44]. Interestingly, we found that cells growing in
physiologically normal conditions have differing levels
of expression for the RAD51 gene: while RAD51 was
upregulated in T2851/R, RAD51 was downregulated in
T2821/R cells in comparison with respective parental cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 4). Immunofluorescent detection of the RAD51
protein in gamma-radiated cells confirmed that RAD51
protein level in T2821/R cells was significantly lower than
RAD51 protein level in parental T2821 cells (Figure 6E).
The level of RAD51 expression in T2851/R cells and
the post-radiation dynamics of expression were exactly
the same as in parental T2851 cells (Figure 6F). These
data provide more evidence that different radioresistance
mechanisms were utilized in T2821/R and T2851/R cells.
Taken together, our data revealed that treatment of
human lung adenocarcinoma cells with multiple fraction
of IR leads to generation of residual radioresistant cells
characterized by multiple changes in expression of
genes/proteins involved in regulation of the cell cycle,
EMT and DNA repair. These radioresistant cells were
also found to be significantly more resistant to cisplatin;
they have upregulated multiple factors that are involved
in prosurvival signaling, such as AKT, inflammatory
cytokine IL-6, growth and angiogenic factors, PDGFB,
and SDF-1 (CXCL12), and CXCR4 receptor for SDF-1.
We hypothesize that multiple prosurvival proteins
could be targeted in order to reduce the residual
radioresistant cells which survive fractionated irradiation
treatments.

Effect of HSP90 inhibition on T2821/R and
T2851/R cells
Cancer cell transformations are dependent on
molecular chaperone HSP90, and inhibition of HSP90
leads to inappropriate processing of multiple client proteins
involved in cell survival pathways [29, 34, 45]. AKT, which is
significantly upregulated in both T2821/R and T2851/R cells,
(Figure 1E) is among the client proteins for HSP90 [46]. We
recently reported that IR treatment upregulated the level of
pAKT in T2821 and T2851 lung adenocarcinoma cells, which
could be blocked by the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib [28].

Here we show that HSP90 protein is present at high
levels in parental T2821 and T2851 cells as well as in
radioresistant T2821/R and T2851/R cells (Figure 7A, 7B),
suggesting that targeting HSP90 activity with ganetespib
might reduce IR resistant cells. We further investigated
whether ganetespib as a monotherapy would be an effective
tool against IR-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells
and have evaluated the safety of ganetespib for normal
diploid human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90 cells). T2821,
T2851, T2821/R, T2851/R lung adenocarcinoma cells and
normal human fibroblasts (IMR-90) cells were cultured
in the presence of graded concentrations of ganetespib
(0–200 nM) for 72 hours and the MTT assay was applied
(Figure 7C). Ganetespib at concentration up to 200 nM did
not affect viability of normal human fibroblasts. In contrast,
ganetespib was found to have a strong antiproliferative
effect against lung adenocarcinoma cells; in both the
parental and IR- resistant cells (Figure 7B). Expression
of EMT markers, upregulation of CXCR4 receptors
and high migratory capacity is a key characteristic of
metastatic tumor cells [47]. We have reported recently that
ganetespib inhibits migration of T2821 and T2851 lung
adenocarcinoma cells [28]. Here, using a scratch-wound
assay, we demonstrate that ganetespib at concentrations of
25 nM and 100 nM inhibits the migration of T2821/R and
T2851/R radioresistant cells (Figure 7D, 7E).
Treatment of T2821/R and T2851/R cells with
ganetespib for 48 hours significantly downregulated p-AKT
expression (Figure 7F) and decreased the level of IL-6

production (Figure 7G) in IR-resistant cells. Incubation of
T2821 and T2851parental cells and radioresistant T2821/R
and T2851/R cells with ganetespib at 3 nM concentration
reduced cells proliferation (Figure 7H, 7I).
Next, using clonogenic survival assay we have
determined that pretreatment of parental T2821 and T2851
cells and radioresistant T2821R and T2851/R cells with
ganetespib at low concentration of 3 nM for 24 hours before
irradiation significantly potentiated the effect of IR (Figure
7J–7M). Pretreatment of T2821/R and T2851/R cells with
ganetespib at concentration of 6 nM reduced clonogenic
survival of non irradiated cells and completely abrogated clonal
survival after IR treatment with dose of 4 Gy (Figure 7L, 7M).

DISCUSSION
Although significant advances in the use of highdose IR have shown high efficacy in control of lung cancer
tumors, patients were found to still suffer from distant
metastasis [48, 49].
Chronic exposure to IR induced an adaptive response
in the tumor cells resulting in tolerance to subsequent IR
treatments with the generation of radioresistant residual
cells that increase the risk of tumor recurrence, metastasis
and negatively affects survival outcomes [31, 49, 50].
Therefore, it is of critical importance to eliminate
these radioresistant residual cells.
To address this question we have generated
T2821/R and T2851/R radioresistant sublines by treating

T2821 and T2851 cells with multiple fractions of IR
and have characterized their radioresistant phenotypes.
Importantly, our study demonstrates the potent ability of
the novel HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib to eliminate these
radioresistant residual cells.
Currently the development of innovative
pharmacotherapy for NSCLC is tailored to tumor-specific
molecular aberrations, however radiotherapy treatments
still are applied without stratification for the genetic
background or genetic heterogeneity of the disease
[48, 49, 51–53].
In our study we used 2 genetically dissimilar human
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines: EGFR mutant (exon 21
L858R mutation) T2851 cells and T2821 cells expressing
wild type (wt) KRAS and EGFR. To generate radioresistant
sublines, T2821 and T2851 lung adenocarcinoma cells
were both simultaneously treated with increasing doses of
fractionated gamma-radiation. In this study we highlight
not only similarities but also some of the diverse biological
differences between T2821/R and T2851/R sublines
which probably result from the differences in the genetic
background of the tumor cells [28].

levels of γH2AX, 53BP1, pATM and pATR proteins in
the resistant cells.
Importantly that both 2821/R and T2851/R cells
surviving multiple fractions of IR display not only high
resistance to ionizing radiation, but are also resistant to
cisplatin. This is an essential observation since cisplatin
and carboplatin are commonly used in combination with
radiotherapy for NSCLC treatment [2–4].
Radioresistance and cisplatin resistance of T2821/R
and T2851/R cells is associated with EMT phenotypes
of these cells: cell morphology changes with the
activation of EMT regulating transcription factors and
expression of EMT associated proteins, vimentin and
fibronectin. In cancers, EMT is associated with resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation [54, 55], via
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [56].
T2821/R and T2851/R cells have significantly
upregulated AKT protein suggesting that targeting PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling might radiosensitize cells and
improve the outcome for radiotherapy. As a major regulator
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, Akt is a serine/threonine
protein kinase that plays a critical role in suppressing
apoptosis by regulating its downstream pathway. mTOR
acts as a downstream effector for Akt, and regulates key
processes such as cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle
progression and protein translation through two distinct
pathways: one involving the ribosomal p70S6 kinase
(p70S6K), and the other involving eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs) [57].

Similarities between T2821/R and T2851/R cells
Both T2821/R and T2851/R cells have demonstrated
higher clonogenic survival after irradiation in comparison
with parental T2821 and T2851 cells. This observed
increased clonogenic survival is associated with lower

Differences between T2851/R and T2851/R cells

PI3K/AKT signaling is activated in response to IR treatment
in NSCLC cells [28, 34]. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathways has been evaluated as a potential strategy to
sensitize tumor cells to radiation in different cancer cell
lines, however the inhibitors that are currently available are
effective in only relatively high concentrations [58].
Both T2821/R and T2851/R cells demonstrated
an elevated production of interleukin IL-6, and platelet
derived growth factor B (PDGFB). IL-6 is a pleotropic
proinflammatory cytokine that has been shown to be
expressed in over 50% of NSCLC and is associated with
poor survival of lung cancer patients [59]. Studies of the
IL-6 mechanism of action suggests that IL-6 promotes
lung cancer cell proliferation and migration through
activation of the transcription factor Signal Transducer and
activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) [35]. PDGFBB and
its receptors play an important role in tumor cell migration
and vasculature formation. These molecules are well
known drivers of mesenchymal cell proliferation [60, 61]
and are known clients for HSP90 [62].
A significant upregulation of SDF-1/CXCR4 was
detected in both the T2821/R and T2851/R cells. These
radioresistant cells were found to have elevated production
of SDF-1 (CXCL12) and significant upregulation of
CXCR4 receptors in comparison with their respective
parental cells. Activation of SDF-1/ CXCR4 signaling is a
key characteristic of metastatic tumor cells [63, 64]. SDF-1/
CXCR4 signaling is regulated by hypoxia inducible factor
1 (HIF1) [65, 66] which is also a client for HSP90 [17].

While T2821/R cells have a growth rate similar
to parental T2821 and T2851 cells, the doubling time for
T2851R is significantly longer. Both T2821/R and T2851/R
cells have a distinct spindle –like morphology and have
lost cell-to cell junctions. These cellular morphological
changes are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) but are a product of different patterns of
gene expression in the two radioresistant cell lines. The
acquired radioresistance in T2821/R and T2851 /R cells is
associated with the multiple changes in genes and protein
expression. While T2821/R cells show altered expression of
genes related to BER, NER and DSB repair, T2851/R cells
demonstrated changes only in DSB repair genes. Our data
on DNA repair gene expression is consistent with previous
studies of the global gene expression in parental and isolated
radioresistant subpopulations in breast [67], esophageal
[68], cervical [69], pancreatic [70] and lung cancers [71, 72]
showing that acquired radioresistance is associated with
upregulation/downregulation of hundreds of genes. These
genes are involved in different cell functions and are located
in different cellular compartments. Interestingly, RAD51
gene was downregulated in T2821/R cells and RAD51
protein level was also lower in T2821/R cells, in comparison
the T2851/R cells show the same level of RAD51 gene and
RAD51protein expression as T2851 cells.
Cell-cycle checkpoints surveillance serves to protect
cells from DNA damaging stresses [73]. Both, parental

T2821 and T2851 as well as IR resistant T2821/R and
T2851/R cells were arrested in G2/M phase after irradiation,
however only T2821/R cells showed an additional increase
at G1 fraction at 24 and 30 hours post-radiation.
Taken together, our data demonstrates that treating
NSCLC with the multiple fractions of IR selects for the
radioresistant residual cells. These radioresistant cells
survive radiotherapy via activation of multiple prosurvival
signaling pathways and radioresistance mechanisms. Key
components of these prosurvival signaling pathways
include such genes as AKT, STAT3, HIF1, PDGFR, ATR/
CHK1 etc., which are all clients for molecular chaperone
HSP90 [20].

tissue cells, therefore our finding that ganetespib doesn’t affect
proliferation of normal human lung fibroblasts is important.
High migration and invasion capacities are key
characteristics of metastatic tumor cells, however, drugs
capable of blocking metastasis are not available yet [63].
Our finding that ganetespib at nanomolar concentration
decreases the migration of T2821/R and T2851/R
radioresistant cells complements our recent observation
that ganetespib was able to reduce the migration of A549,
T2821 and T2851 lung adenocarcinoma cells [28] and
highlight a ganetespib as a possible antimetastatic drug.
HSP90 inhibitors can both directly or indirectly
modulate the expression of multiple client proteins. We
found that AKT, PDGF, IL-6 and SDF-1/CXCR4 proteins
are significantly upregulated in T2821/R and T2851/R
cells. Therefore we chose to investigate the effect of
ganetespib on two central transcription factors: HIF-1a
and STAT-3 associated with these signaling pathways.
It is known that the AKT/mTOR pathway drives the
synthesis of HIF-1 alpha protein in irradiated tumors [74].
SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is essential for pericyte recruitment
within the PDGF-BB-overexpressing tumors [75]. The
HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway governs the primary and
metastatic tumor microenvironments and organ-specific
metastases in different malignancies [76, 77]. Upregulation
of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is associated with lung
cancer progressions [35]. Moreover, the presence of an
autocrine signaling loop between HIF-1a and STAT-3

Effects of ganetespib on T2821/R and T2851/R
cells
Our study is the first to demonstrate that the HSP90
inhibitor ganetespib, used as a monotherapy, has a strong
cytotoxic effect on radioresistant residual cells which
have survived multiple fractions of gamma-radiation. We
have determined that ganetespib as monotherapy has the
similar antitumor effect on parental T2821 and T2851
lung adenocarcinoma cells and T2821/R and T2851/R
radioresistant residual adenocarcinoma cells which
survived multiple treatments of IR.
A key factor for the clinical success of a drug is the
ability to selectively target only tumor cells and not normal

was demonstrated in pancreatic cancer cell lines, where
hypoxia mediates an increase in IL-6 production through
HIF-1a leading to activation of STAT-3 [78]. Lastly,
both HIF-1a and STAT-3 are HSP90 client proteins. We
found that inhibition of HSP90 with ganetespib resulted
in downregulation of p-AKT and decreased production
of IL-6 in T2821/R and T2851/R cells thus confirming
the role of PI3/AKT and IL-6/STAT- 3 signaling in
radioresistance phenotype in T2821/R and T2851/R cells
surviving multiple fractions of IR. Recently the central

role of HSP90 in regulation of both HIF-1a and STAT- 3
and a strong antiangiogenic effect of ganetespib were
confirmed in colorectal cancer [79].
Of particular significance is our finding that ganetespib
at 3 nM concentration has a strong radiosensitizing effect,
while ganetespib at 6 nM concentration completely
inhibits clonal growth from T2821/R and T2851/R cells
radioresistant cells after IR, 5 Gy.
These data with our recent report [28] demonstrated
that ganetespib effectively radiosensitizes A549, T2821

Conclusion
We established T2851/R and T2821/R radioresistant
residual sublines by exposing genetically dissimilar human
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to multiple fractions of IR.
These radioresistant cell sublines exhibited morphological
changes and upregulation of multiple radioresistance
mechanisms. Importantly that both 2821/R and T2851/R
cells surviving multiple fractions of IR display not only
high resistance to ionizing radiation, but are also resistant to
cisplatin. The radioresistance mechanisms detected include
alterations of cell cycle distribution, upregulation of PI3K/
AKT signaling, higher expression of DNA repair genes,
and elevated production of prosurvival and angiogenic
factors (IL-6, PDGFB and SDF-1) and CXCR4 receptors
important for lung cancer progression and metastasis.
We have presented data which demonstrates that
the inhibition of HSP90 is a unique approach which is
able to sensitize lung tumor cells to fractionated IR and
avoid selection of residual radioresistant cells. Avoiding
selection for residual radioresistant cells is significant
as we believe these cells might be responsible for tumor
recurrence and metastasis.

Irradiation
AC cells were irradiated, as cell suspension or as
monolayer, using the Shepherd Mark 168 Irradiator,
(137Cs Irradiator) (JL Shepherd, San Fernando, CA, USA)
at a dose rate of 70.6 rad/min at room temperature.

Cell’s doubling time
Cells were plated into 24 well plates and cell numbers
per well were estimated at 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cell
numbers per well were summarized by mean ± standard
deviation for each of the 4 cell groups (i.e., T2821,
T2821 /R, T2851 and T2851/R) at each time of
measurement. A simple linear regression model was built
for log (cell number per well) for each cell group, using the
measurement time as a continuous explanatory variable. For
each cell group, the estimate of cell doubling time (dt) was
calculated based on the slope of regression line (β) using
the formula dt = log2/ β, and its standard error was also
calculated, based on the formula: SE(dt) = log(2)*SE(β)/ β2
[80]. The comparison of doubling times between cells
groups was performed using z-tests, based on these
estimated values and their standard errors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells

cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was analyzed
with Becton-Dickinson software.

In vitro clonogenic assays
Exponentially growing cells were harvested by
exposure to trypsin and cells were seeded in 6 well plates,
500 cells per well. Next day, HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib
was added to the cultures at the final concentrations of
0–10 nM. 24 hours later, the plates were irradiated using
a 137Cs gamma-ray source with doses ranging from 0 to
10 Gy. Seven days later, the cells were fixed and stained
with crystal violet; colonies ≥ 50 cells were counted and
the size of the colonies were measured (Gel Count colony
counter, Oxford Optronix, Oxford, UK) as we described
[31]. Data was analyzed with linear quadratic and singlehit multi-target models [81].

Analysis of the intracellular cytokines in tumor cells
To detect intracellular cytokines production
and accumulation, we used the methods as previously
described [39]. Parental T2821, T2851 cells and
radioresistant T2821/R and T2851/R cells (104cells/
well) grown in 96-well plates were incubated with
monensin (2 µM) for 48 hours. Cells were ﬁxed in 2%
PFA, washed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100,
washed with FACS buffer and then incubated with
antibodies against IL-6, SDF-1 (CXCL12) and PDGFB
for 1 hr and with secondary antibodies conjugated with
Alexa 488, or 546 ﬂuorochromes (Molecular Probes/
Invitrogen, Eugene, CA) for 1 hr. Cell nuclei were stained
with Hoechst 33342 at 2 µg/ml for 20 min to identify
individual cells. Cell images were acquired and analyzed
using the Cellomics ArrayScan HCS Reader (Cellomics/
ThermoFisher, Pittsburgh, PA).

Immunofluorescence detection of γH2AX, pATR,
pATM, RAD51, and 53BP1
Cells were irradiated with 0 or 5 Gy at RT. After
IR treatment, cells were incubated in the culture media
supplemented with 10% of FBS, 37οC, 5% CO2, for
0–24 hours. Then the cells were fixed and permeabilizedATM,
phospho-ATM and RAD51 antibodies and secondary
antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, and 546. HCS/ and
HCA ArrayScan tools were used as described previously [26].

Measurement of IL-6 secreted by tumor cells
T2821, T2851, T2821/R and T2851/R cells were
seeded in 96-well plates (3x103cells/ well) and grown for
72 hours. Each cell line was plated in three independent
wells. Then culture media conditioned by tumor cells
were collected, cells were fixed, stained with Hoechst
33342 and cell numbers in each well were counted using
Cellomics Array.
ELISA kit was obtained from R & D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA) and concentrations of IL-6 were
determined according to manufacturer’s instructions. The
IL-6 concentrations were calculated as pg/1 × 106 tumor
cells as follows:

Real-Time PCR and gene expression profiling
RNA was isolated from the cells using the RNeasy
kit from Qiagen (Germantown, MD), and the extracted
RNA was converted to cDNA using the qScript™ cDNA
SuperMix from Quanta Biosciences (Gaithersburg, MD)
according to manufacturer’s protocols. Real-time PCR was
carried out using the Fast SYBR® Green Master Mix (Life
Technologies) and was performed on the StepOnePlus™
Real-Time PCR System (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Primers for human SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1,
ZEB1, ZEB2, CDH1 (E-cadherin), CDH2 (N-cadherin),
ATM, RAD50, RAD51, ERCC, and XRCC2 genes were
purchased from IDT Technologies (Coralville, IA),
Amplifications were run in triplicate for each primer
pair. Comparative quantification of gene expression was
performed using the ΔΔCT method. Expression of all
genes is referenced to T2821 mRNA. List of primers
sequences is presented in supplement Table 1.
The Human DNA Repair RT² Profiler™ PCR Array
kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), was used. This PCR
Array profiles the expression of 84 key genes encoding
the enzymes that repair damaged DNA. This array
represents genes involved in the base-excision, nucleotide
excision, mismatch, double-strand break, and other repair
processes. Real-time PCR detection was carried out per

Concentration of IL-6 (pg/ml)
× volume of media (ml/well) × 1 × 106 cells
Number of tumor cells per well

Cell cycle analysis
Exponentially growing cells were irradiated (0, or
5 Gy) and fixed after 0, 8, 24 and 30 hours post-radiation.
Cells were then harvested and resuspended in ice cold
PBS. Iced cold 70% ethanol was used to fix the cells and
they were stored overnight at 4°C, washed twice with
PBS, and resuspended in 50 μg/ml PI staining reagent
containing 100 μg/ml RNase and 0.1% Triton X-100 for
30 min in the dark. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry

the manufacturer’s instructions. The experimental cocktail
was prepared by mixing cDNA isolated from cell lines with
the RT2 Real-Time SyBR Green/ROX qPCRMasterMix.
The mixtures were equally aliquoted into the 96-well plate
containing predispensed gene-specific primer sets, then
real-time PCR was performed using the StepOnePlus™
Real-Time PCR System (ABI, Applied Biosytems Corp.,
Foster City, CA). Differences in genes expression were
compared between T2821 and T2821IR/R cells, as well
as T2851 and T2821IR/R cells. Analyses of the raw data
were done through the GeneGlobe Data Analysis Center
Web (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Experiments were
performed three times.

FUNDING

Western blotting

This project is funded, in part, under a grant NIH
(1R21CA164740), P50 CA090440, and UPCI LUNG
SPORE and with the Pennsylvania Department of Health
grant. This project used the UPCI Flow Cytometry Facility
that is supported in part by award P30CA047904.

Western blotting analysis was performed as
previously described [28]. The tumor cells were
harvested and disrupted using lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology) in the presence of protease inhibitor and
incubated on ice for 30 minutes (vortex every 10 min).
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and equal
amounts of proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE before
transfer to PVDF membrane (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA).
The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk,
incubated with primary antibodies against human AKT
or HSP90 followed by addition of secondary antibodies.
Chemiluminescence signals were detected on the X-ray
film. As an internal control the GAPDH primary antibody
was also probed. The gel-digiting software Un-Scan-It
gel (Version 5.1; Silk Scientific, Inc., Orem, UT, USA)
was used to quantify the intensities of Chemiluminescent
bands detected.

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. Comparisons
between values were performed using a two tailed Student’s
t-test. For the comparison of multiple groups, a one- or twoway ANOVA test was applied. For all statistical analyses,
the level of significance was set at a probability of P <
0.05. All experiments were repeated 3–5 times. IR survival
curves were analyzed by comparison with the linearquadratic and the single-hit multi-target models. Statistical
comparisons used the final slope of the survivorship curves,
representing multiple-event killing (D0) [82].
