Abstract

Author Manuscript

Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors
that initiate distal metastases1. While these cells are extraordinarily rare, they may identify cellular
pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer. Here, we adapted a
microfluidic device2 for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer
model3 and subjected CTCs to single molecule RNA sequencing4, identifying Wnt2 as a candidate
gene enriched in CTCs. Expression of Wnt2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis,
enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increases metastatic propensity in vivo.
This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of Map3k7
(Tak1) kinase. In humans, formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is
associated with upregulation of multiple Wnt genes, and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for
Wnt signaling in 5 of 11 cases. Thus, molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate
therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer.
We established the HbCTC-Chip microfluidic capture platform1, to isolate CTCs from blood
samples of a genetically engineered mouse pancreatic cancer model2, comparing their

expression profile to that of simultaneously harvested primary tumour and metastatic ascites
cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Captured cells were stained for epithelial
cytokeratin (CK) and the leukocyte marker CD45, with CTCs scored as CK+/ CD45− (Fig.
1b). Eight control tumour-free mice had a median of 1.3 CK+/CD45− cells /100 µL of blood
(range, 0.2–5.6; mean, 1.8 ± 0.6) under the selected imaging parameters. Applying a
threshold of ≥ 6 cells/100 µL, 7/8 tumour-bearing mice were positive for CTCs (median, 31
cells/100 µL; range, 2–547; mean, 115 ± 67) (Fig. 1b, c). Most CTCs were captured as
single cells, although clusters of 5 to 10 cells were seen in ~50% of mouse blood samples.
The on-chip purity of captured CTCs ranged from 0.1–6%, due to non-specific binding
(NSB) by leukocytes (Supplementary Table 1).

Given the minute amounts and variable purity of CTCs, we applied a sub-microgram RNA
based sequencing method using a single molecule “next generation” platform3, to derive a
Digital Gene Expression (DGE) profile. We processed each blood sample through paired
EpCAM- and mock IgG-functionalized HbCTC-Chips, allowing digital subtraction of
matched NSB leukocyte reads from each CTC-enriched DGE profile. Using the DEGseq
statistical model5 applied to the MA-plot with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.10, we
identified 361 transcripts in mouse MPANC-9 that were increased >2-fold in anti-EpCAMversus IgG-chips, and absent in blood from non-tumour bearing mice (Fig. 1d). This CTC
candidate gene set was then compared with DGE profiles of 12 mouse and 15 human
primary pancreatic tumours, versus normal mouse and human pancreata6, yielding a set of 9
tumour-associated genes whose expression was markedly increased in CTCs
(Supplementary Table 2). One of these, Wnt2, was found to be consistently enriched in
pancreatic cancers in the Oncomine™, leading us to pursue this gene as a prototype CTCenriched transcript. RNA sequencing of metastatic cells in the mouse ascites demonstrated
enrichment for Wnt2. A second mouse, MPANC-10, also demonstrated Wnt2 expression in
both CTCs and metastatic ascites cells. The lower number of Wnt2 mRNA reads in
MPANC-10 was correlated with the fewer cytokeratin transcript reads, suggesting that both
transcripts track with the number of CTCs in the blood specimen (Supplementary Table 3).

Author Manuscript

Given the absence of antibodies for cellular imaging of Wnt2, we developed fluorescent
RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) to verify Wnt2 expression in CTCs (Supplementary
Figs. 2 and 3). RNA-ISH analysis of CTCs using dual staining for Wnt2 and cytokeratin
mRNAs identified Wnt2 transcripts in 64% of cytokeratin-expressing cells in 3/4 mice. A
comparable Wnt2 mRNA signal was observed in metastatic cells from ascites of mice
bearing pancreatic tumours (Fig. 1e). In contrast, within primary tumour specimens, Wnt2
mRNA expression was only detectable in very small localized clusters of cells (1–5% of all
cells) in 8/14 primary tumour specimens (Fig. 1f). Histological analysis of rare Wnt2
positive cells within PDACs did not reveal any obvious distinction from other tumour cells.
The small number of Wnt2-positive cells in primary tumour specimens was consistent with
DGE analysis, which showed rare Wnt2 RNA reads in both mouse (8/12) and human (9/15)
PDACs. Thus, Wnt2 positive cells are present within both CTC and metastatic ascites, and
represent a rare subset of the primary tumour population.
To test the functional consequences of Wnt2 expression in vivo, lentiviral constructs were
introduced into NB508 PDAC cells, which lack detectable endogenous Wnt2 expression

(Supplementary Fig. 4). Subcutaneous engraftment of GFP-tagged Wnt2-NB508 cells
produced significantly more lung metastases in nude mice, compared with vector-transduced
cells, despite the larger size of vector-expressing primary tumours (n=8, p<0.05) (Fig. 2a
and Supplementary Fig. 4). EpCAM-captured CTCs showed a modest increase in numbers
in mice bearing Wnt2-expressing tumours, but this did not reach statistical significance
(p=0.25, Fig. 2b), even after normalization for the smaller size of Wnt2-expressing tumours
(p=0.17, Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, Wnt2 expression may increase the metastatic
potential of circulating cancer cells, without markedly increasing their generation from
primary tumours. Consistent with this hypothesis, direct intravascular inoculation of cells
into the tail vein of syngeneic mice, which bypasses the vascular invasion step, showed a
striking increase in lung metastases for Wnt2-NB508 cells (5/6 Wnt2-transduced versus 0/6
vector, p<0.05) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4).

Modeling the effects of ectopic Wnt2 expression on NB508 PDAC cells cultured in vitro
showed marked enhancement of anchorage independent growth, without affecting cellular
proliferation, migration or invasion assayed under standard conditions (Supplementary Fig.
5, 6). Tumour sphere formation under non-adherent conditions in serum-free media
supplemented with growth factors7,8 was markedly increased by Wnt2 expression, with
respect to sphere numbers (p<0.05) and size (p<0.005) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 7).
Anoikis, the induction of apoptosis in epithelial cells resulting from loss of basement
membrane attachment, was attenuated following Wnt2 expression in NB508 cells (Fig. 2e).
Resistance to anoikis is thought to be essential for epithelial cell survival in the bloodstream,
and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been postulated to mediate this effect.
We therefore tested for induction of characteristic mesenchymal markers by Wnt2 at both
RNA and protein levels, by DGE analysis and Western blotting respectively. Among
classical EMT markers, we only detected induction of fibronectin (Fn1), an extracellular
protein implicated in cell-matrix interactions and cellular survival signals (Fig. 2e,
Supplementary Figs. 6, 8). shRNA-mediated knockdown of Fn1 suppressed the ability of
ectopic Wnt2 to enhance tumour sphere formation (n=6, p<0.05, Fig. 2f), suggesting that
Fn1 contributes to Wnt2-mediated anoikis resistance. Two transcription factors, Mycn and
the known Fn1 regulator Etv4, were induced by Wnt2, with their knockdown suppressing
Fn1 expression, suggesting that they contribute to mediating the Wnt2 effect
(Supplementary Fig. 9).

Wnt2 may signal through either canonical (β-catenin/TCF dependent) or non-canonical
pathways. While canonical Wnt signaling expression signatures have been developed, there
are no such signatures for non-canonical Wnt pathways. We therefore generated a
customized non-canonical Wnt signaling gene set (Supplementary Table 4)9 and used this to
interrogate the CTC DGE data. Significant enrichment was observed for components of the
non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in mouse pancreatic CTCs, metastatic ascites cells,
and Wnt2-NB508 cells grown under non-adherent sphere-forming conditions
(Supplementary Figs. 10, 11 and Supplementary Table 5). Similar enrichment was noted for
a Wnt and TGF-β driven signature10 (Supplementary Table 6). No such enrichment was
evident for signatures of canonical Wnt signaling in CTCs and metastatic ascites cells,

although Wnt2-NB508 cells showed a mild increase in canonical Wnt signaling
(Supplementary Table 6, Fig. 12).

We tested a panel of inhibitors of Wnt-related pathways to identify small molecule inhibitors
capable of suppressing the Wnt2 effect on anoikis. Among these, 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, an
inhibitor of Map3k7, also known as Tak1 (TGF-β activated kinase 1)11, was remarkable in
completely abrogating Wnt2-induced tumour spheres, without suppressing baseline sphere
formation (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. 12, 13). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol also suppressed Fn1
expression in Wnt2-NB508 cells (Fig. 3b). To validate the effect of the Tak1 inhibitor in
reversing the prosurvival phenotype conferred by Wnt2, shRNA constructs targeting Tak1
were introduced into Wnt2-NB508 cells. Tak1 shRNAs suppressed Fn1 expression in Wnt2NB508 cells with an associated increase in cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. 9d). Effective suppression of Wnt2-induced tumour sphere formation was observed and
correlated with the degree of Tak1 knockdown by the shRNA constructs (Fig. 3d).
Consistent with these in vitro findings, the generation of metastases following tail vein
inoculation of Wnt2-expressing cells was suppressed as a function of shRNA knockdown of
Tak1 (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 14). Together, these results support the role of Wnt2
in mediating metastasis-associated survival signals, which depend, at least in part, on a
Tak1-Fn1 signaling axis.

To extend our analyses to human pancreatic cancer, we captured CTCs from blood
specimens of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer using the HbCTC-Chip and stained
the cells with a combination of antibodies against cytokeratin and intracellular EpCAM
residues (Fig. 4a). Under conditions optimized for human pancreatic CTC analysis, 10
healthy controls had a median 1.2 CK+EpCAM+/CD45− cells (range, 0 to 2.2; mean, 1.3 ±
0.2). Of 15 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, 11 had CTC counts above threshold
(≥ 3 CK+EpCAM+/CK45− cells/mL), with a median 11 cells/mL (range, 1 to 57; mean, 18
± 5; on-chip median purity, 0.5%) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 7). We tested for Wnt2
expression in human pancreatic CTCs using RNA-ISH identifying Wnt2 transcripts in 23 of
66 (35%) CK-positive CTCs from 2 of 8 metastatic PDAC patients (Fig. 4c). To derive DGE
profiles for human pancreatic CTCs, we followed the strategy defined for mouse CTC
analyses, analyzing blood specimens from 12 patients and 4 healthy controls using parallel
anti-EpCAM versus mock IgG-functionalized HbCTC-Chips, followed by low quantity
RNA-based single molecule sequencing analysis. No individual Wnt transcript was
consistently enriched across all CTC-enriched populations (FDR 0.10), but among 11
patients with CTC counts above threshold, 5 (45%) had significant enrichment of noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway components and 8 (73%) showed enrichment for the Wnt
and TGF-β-driven profile (Supplementary Table 8). No such enrichment was present in 4
healthy controls or in one patient without detectable CTCs (Supplementary Tables 9, 10,
11).
To test whether multiple Wnt genes contribute to anoikis resistance in human pancreatic
cancer, we measured expression of all known family members in six cell lines grown under
non-adherent tumour sphere conditions. Five of six cell lines showed upregulation of
multiple Wnt genes following shift from 2D to 3D culture, an effect that was correlated with
sensitivity to the Tak1 inhibitor and to Tak1 shRNA (Fig. 4d, e and Supplementary Figs.

15–17, Table 12). Thus, in human pancreatic cancer cells, the induction of multiple Wnt
family members appears to circumvent anoikis following loss of adherence, an effect
suppressed by inhibition of Tak1.
In summary, we have applied microfluidic CTC isolation from a genetically engineered
mouse model to generate an unbiased RNA sequencing profile for CTC-specific expression
patterns. The cellular pathways activated during the haematogenous spread of human
pancreatic cancer are likely to be complex, and our analysis is limited by technological
hurdles inherent in the molecular characterization of partially purified CTC populations.
Nonetheless, our results suggest that non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways may contribute
to metastasis in human pancreatic cancer. The effectiveness of Tak1 inhibition in
suppressing this effect identifies a novel potential drug target for metastasis suppression.

Mice with pancreatic cancer used in these experiments express Cre driven by Pdx1 or P48,
LSL-KrasG12D, and Tp53lox/+ or Tp53lox/lox as previously described 2. Normal B6/129, FVB,
and Nu/Nu mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. For cardiocentesis, animals were
sedated with isofluorane, the chest wall was sterilized with ethanol and a skin incision was
made above the rib cage. A 23-gauge needle was used to draw approximately 1 mL of blood
into a syringe primed with 100 µL of PBS-10mM EDTA pH 7.4 (Gibco). Animals were then
euthanized per animal protocol guidelines. Pancreatic tumours and normal tissues were
extracted and separated using flash freezing with liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and
fixation with 4% PFA followed by paraffin embedding (FFPE) for RNA-ISH and
histochemistry. Ascites if present was sterilely removed with a 23G needle syringe and cells
were pelleted by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA
extraction. Cell lines generated from mouse tumours and human pancreatic cancer cell lines
were cultured in RPMI-1640 + 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco/Invitrogen).

were manufactured on site at the MGH Cancer Center/ BioMEMS Resource
Facility, and chips were functionalized using biotinylated antibodies as previously
described 1. Mouse HbCTC-Chips were functionalized with biotinylated anti-mouse EpCAM
(CD326) antibody (Biolegend 118204) or isotype control biotinylated Rat IgG2a (Biolegend
400504). Human HbCTC-Chips were functionalized with biotinylated polyclonal goat antihuman EpCAM (R&D Systems BAF960) or control goat IgG antibody (R&D Systems
BAF108).
For mouse samples, approximately 1 mL of mouse blood was diluted 1:1 with PBS-10 mM
EDTA pH 7.4 and a total volume of 1 mL of diluted blood was processed on each HbCTCChip, using a Harvard Apparatus volumetric syringe pump set at 1.5 mL/hr. After
processing the blood, devices were washed with PBS followed by analyses as described
below.

Human blood specimens obtained for CTC analysis was obtained after informed consent,
per IRB protocol (05–300) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). A maximum of
20 mL of blood were obtained at any given blood draw, using EDTA vacutainers. Blood
specimens were processed through the HbCTC-Chip within 4 hours of blood draw.
Approximately 3 mL of blood was processed through the HbCTC-Chip, using the pressure
controlled apparatus, at a target flow rate of 1.5 mL/hr as previously described 2.

Following blood processing, captured cells on the HbCTC-Chip were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 1%
NP40 in PBS, blocked with either 5% donkey serum (mouse samples) or 3% goat serum/2%
BSA (human samples), and then immunostained with the relevant primary antibodies.
Primary antibodies for the mouse CTC analyses were rabbit anti-wide spectrum cytokeratin
(1:50, Abcam ab9377), chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam ab13970) and goat anti-mouse
CD45 (1:500, R&D systems AF114). Primary antibodies for the human CTC analyses were
rabbit anti-wide spectrum cytokeratin (1:50, Abcam ab9377), rabbit anti-EpCAM (1:500,
Abcam ab71916), and mouse IgG1 anti-CD45 (1:1000, BD 55480). Secondary
immunofluorescent-tagged antibodies were used for signal amplification. For the mouse,
these were donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, Invitrogen A-21207), donkey antichicken Dylight™ 488 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch 703-486-155) and donkey antigoat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen A-11055). For human, the secondary antibodies
were goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, Invitrogen A-11012) and goat anti-mouse
IgG1 Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen A-21121). Nuclei were then stained with DAPI
and the devices were washed with PBS and stored at 4°C. The devices were imaged under
10× magnification using the BioView Ltd. automated imaging system (Billerica, MA) as
well as an automated upright fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 90i, Nikon, Melville, NY).
Positive staining for CK or EpCAM, without CD45 staining, was required for scoring
potential CTCs, which were then manually reviewed. Threshold and baseline signals were
established using specimens from non-tumour bearing mice or healthy human controls.
RNA Extraction and Purification from the HbCTC-Chip and from tissues
RNA from CTC-enriched cell populations was isolated from the devices using a modified
protocol for the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 375 µl of the RLT buffer
was pipetted into the HbCTC-Chip with mixing between the inlet and outlet of the device.
The resulting RLT lysate was then loaded onto the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute column and
RNA was purified per protocol. RNA was eluted in a total of ~ 10 µL RNase free water.

To isolate RNA from fresh frozen tissues, the material was pulverized with a sterile pestle in
a microfuge tube on dry ice. RNA from cell lines and fresh frozen tumour and normal
tissues were all processed in the same manner. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol®
Reagent (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s specifications.
Single Molecule Sequencing
Purified RNA was subjected to Digital Gene Expression (DGE) sample prepping and
analyzed on the HeliScope™ Single Molecule Sequencer from Helicos BioSciences.

For mouse samples, a low quantity on surface RNA capture followed by cDNA synthesis
and sequencing method was developed and used on RNA from EpCAM HbCTC-Chip,
IgG HbCTC-Chip, primary tumour, and metastatic ascites. This method has been previously
described 3. Briefly, the purified RNA in RNAse free water was hybridized in 10µl volume
to Helicos poly(dT)-coated sequencing flow cell channels in 1X SSC, 0.05% SDS at 37°C
for 30 minutes. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript III first-strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using manufacturer’s recommendations, except that no
additional primers were added, and the incubation steps were modified as follows: 37°C 15
minutes, and 55°C 45 minutes. Subsequent to cDNA synthesis, hot water was passed
through the channels to degrade and melt away the RNA strands. Guanine tailing was
performed using terminal transferase, by adding 500µM guanine in 20µl volume in 1X TdT
buffer, 2.5mM CoCl2 and 20 units terminal transferase per channel. The reaction took place
at 37°C for 30 minutes, followed by 3’ blocking with 100µM ddGTP and ddATP under the
same reaction conditions. The 18 nt poly-C primers were hybridized at 50nM in 1X SSC,
0.05% SDS at 55°C for 30 minutes, followed by step-wise “fill” steps with 500µM cytosine
and adenine nucleotides with 5 units Klenow fragment (NEB) in 1X NEB2 buffer and 20µl
reaction volume per channel. The lock step was then performed with virtual terminator
guanine and thymidine nucleotide analogs. Single molecule sequencing by synthesis was
then initiated using standard procedures 12.

For human CTC samples, initial low quantity on surface methods did not have sufficient
yield, so application of a low quantity RNA-seq method was utilized as previously
described 12. Briefly, the purified RNA in RNAse free water was converted to first-strand
cDNA with the SuperScript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using random
hexamers according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA was digested and single
stranded cDNA was purified using a combination of QIAquick nucleotide removal kit
(Invitrogen) and ethanol precipitation with ammonium acetate and glycogen. Single stranded
cDNA was denatured and then a poly-A tail was added to the 3’ end using terminal
transferase (New England Biolabs). Tailed cDNAs were then hybridized to the sequencing
flow cell followed by “Fill and Lock” and subjected to single molecule sequencing by
synthesis.

DGE—To compute digital gene expression (DGE) from the Helicos sequence data, we used
the DGE pipeline of the HeliSphere 1.1.498.63 software (open.helicosbio.com) using the
Human.Txome and Mouse.Txome (ftp://ftp.helicosbio.com/pub/distribution) reference
files 13. We ignored DGE output corresponding to mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA and
Helicos control spike-ins.
DEGSeq—DEGseq comparisons of DGE profiles were run using the DEGexp function of
version 1.0.5 of the Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org) DEGseq package. The “method”
argument was set to “MARS” for the MA-plot-based method with Random Sampling 5 and
the threshold for statistical significance was a Benjamini-Hochberg q-value (i.e., FDR
estimate) of 10%.

hGSEA—We performed hypergeometric gene set enrichment analysis (hGSEA) as follows.
To determine whether gene set A was enriched in gene set B, we used the hypergeometric
distribution to test whether the overlap of A and B was larger than would be expected by
chance had A and B been drawn randomly from all the genes quantitated by the DGE. To
account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied the method of Benjamini and Hochberg
to the p-values so generated for each analysis, yielding false discover rate (FDR) estimates.
The odds ratio (OR) is the odds of a gene being in A given it is in B divided by the odds of
that gene being in A given it is not in B. Gene sets evaluated were obtained from MSigDB
(Broad Institute).

Following blood processing, HbCTC-Chips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed
with PBS and dehydrated with ethanol at increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, and
100%). HbCTC-Chips were submerged in 100% ethanol at −20° C for storage. Of note,
mouse metastatic ascites fluid was also run on HbCTC-Chips for RNA-ISH analysis. Before
further analysis, cells were rehydrated using decreasing concentrations of ethanol (70% and
50%) and washed with PBS. ISH was performed using QuantiGene ViewRNA
protocols. HbCTC-Chip were permeabilized with Working Detergent Solution (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA), and digested with Protease (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at 1:2000
dilution in PBS. The HbCTC-Chips were hybridized for 3 hours at 40° C with customdesigned QuantiGene ViewRNA probes against Wnt2 and Cytokeratins 8 and 18. Unbound
probes were flushed out with Wash Buffer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and HbCTC-Chips
were stored overnight at 4° C in Storage Buffer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The bound
probes were amplified the following day through PreAmp (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
hybridization for 1 hour at 40° C, followed by Amp (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
hybridization for 1 hour at 40° C. Label Probes (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) targeting the
individual probe types were added for 1 hour at 40° C. HbCTC-Chips were stained with
DAPI, and images were taken using a Nikon 90i microscope.
QuantiGene ViewRNA in-situ hybridization on FFPE tissue

Mouse tissue for FFPE was prepared per standard protocol by the MGH Clinical and
Research Pathology Cores. ISH was performed using QuantiGene ViewRNA protocols. 5
micron sections were cut, fixed in 10% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA),
deparaffinized, boiled in pre-treatment solution (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and digested
with proteinase K (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Sections were hybridized for 3 hours at
40° with a custom designed QuantiGene ViewRNA probes against Wnt2 and the control
gene Ubc (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Bound probes were then amplified per protocol
from Affymetrix using PreAmp and Amp molecules. Multiple Label Probe oligonucleotides
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (LP-AP Type 1) are then added and Fast Red Substrate is
used to produce signal (red dots, Cy3 fluorescence). For two color assays, an LP-AP type 6
probe is used with Fast Blue substrate (blue dots, Cy5 fluorescence) followed by LP-AP
type 1 probe with Fast Red Substrate (red dots, Cy3 fluorescence) to produce a dual
colorimetric and fluorescent signal. Wnt2 probes were used in type 1/Fast Red and pooled
CK 8 and 18 were used in type 6/Fast Blue. Slides are then counterstained with
Hematoxylin. Serial sections were also subjected to Hematoxylin & Eosin staining per

The mouse Wnt2 open reading frame was cloned into pENTRI plasmid as a BamHI-XhoI
fragment. pWPI plasmid carrying Wnt2 open reading frame was generated by gateway
cloning following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Luciferase gene was expressed
in pMSCV plasmid containing hygromycin selection marker. 7TFP construct (7xTcf-FFluc)
used in TopFlash assay was from addgene. pLKO shRNAs targeting the mouse FN1 and
Tak1 were from the RNAi consortium at the Broad Institute. Control shRNA constructs for
Luciferase (Catalog# SHC007) and non-target (Catalog# SHC016) were purchased from
Sigma. Target sequences for Fn1: 5’-GCCTAGAAATACCTTTCTCTT-3’; for Tak1: B4 5’AGGCAAAGCAACAGAGTGAAT-3’; B7 5’-TCTGAGAGGAAGGCTTTCATT-3’; B6
5’-CAGCCCTAGTGTCAGAATGAT -3’. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteinpseudotyped retroviruses or lentiviruses were generated using 293T cells as packaging cell

were infected with pWPI virus followed by GFP-positive cell sorting. pMSCV-luciferase
was introduced into the cells and followed by 200 µg/ml hygromycin B selection. Cells
transduced with pLKO shRNA virus were selected with 2 µg/ml puromycin. On-target plus
siRNA constructs were purchased from Dharmacon (MYCN: L-058793-01; ETV4:
L-048237-01; non-targeting pool: D-001810-10-20) and transfected into cells with
Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen).
Tumourigenicity and Experimental Metastasis Assays

Author Manuscript

The animal protocol was approved by the MGH Subcommittee on Research Animal Care.
Six-week old Nu/Nu mice were anesthetized by isofluorane, 1 × 106 NB508 cells expressing
vector, or Wnt2 in 100 µl of PBS were injected subcutaneously on the right flank of the
mice. Primary tumours, CTCs, and lungs were sampled after 2 weeks. Six to 8-week old
FVB mice were used for tail vein injection. NB508 cells (5×104) expressing luciferase and
vector, or Wnt2 in 100 µl of PBS were injected into lateral tail vein of the mice. Tumour
formation in the lung was monitored weekly by bioluminescence using IVIS Lumina II
(Caliper Life Science). Mice were euthanized after 6 weeks and lungs were sampled.
Comparison between groups was performed using t-test.
Tumour Sphere Assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated as single cell suspension in ultralow attachment 6-well or 96-well plates
(Corning) and grown in RPMI medium (serum free) supplemented with 20 µl/ml B27
(Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF and 20 ng/ml bFGF. Fresh media (1 ml or 30 µl) was added
every 3 days. Tumour spheres were counted and photographed at day 10. Inhibitors were
purchased from Sigma and used at 1 µM (for mouse cell lines) and 0.3, 1, and 3 µM (for
human cell lines) (5Z-7-Oxozeaenol), 1.8 µM (IWR1), and 1.4 µM (Y-27632). For
immuofluorescent staining, tumour spheres were deposited onto a microscope slide by
cytospin (Shandon), fixed and stained. Comparison between groups was performed using ttest analysis (number differences) or Wilcoxon analysis (size differences).

Anoikis Assay

Author Manuscript

Plates were coated with 10 ml of 20 mg/ml poly-HEMA (Sigma) and air-dried. Cells
(2×106) were plated on the poly-HEMA coated plates. Cells were collected at different time
points and proteins extracted.
Antibodies and Immunoblot Analysis

Author Manuscript

Antibodies used were β-catenin (BD), activated β-catenin (Millipore), Fibronectin, Wnt2
(Sigma), β-tubulin (Santa Cruz), and cleaved Caspase-3, p-Tak1 (Cell Signaling), and Tak1
(Cell Signaling). Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer [20mM Tris, pH8/150mM NaCl/
10mM NaF/0.1% SDS/1% Nonidet P-40/1x protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)]. For
conditioned media, Vec-NB508 or Wnt2-NB508 cells were seeded at 1×106 in regular
growth media (10% FBS) for 2 days in culture, and culture medium was replaced with lowserum media (0.2% FBS). After 24 hours, conditioned medium was collected and cell debris
was removed by centrifugation. Proteins were concentrated using Amico Ultracel 30k
column (Millipore) and resuspended in RIPA buffer to detect the Wnt2 protein by
immunoblot. Lysates were run on an SDS/4–15% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Invitrogen), and immunoblots were visualized with a
Western Lightning Plus chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer). For phospho-Tak1 level, 1ug
of protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with Tak1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) and
blotted with p-Tak1 antibody (Cell Signaling).
SYTO60 Assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media at 1,000 cells /well or serumfree media at 5,000 cells /well. Cells were fixed every day after plating and incubated with
Syto60 red fluorescence nucleic acid staining (Invitrogen) at 1:8000 dilution in 1xPBS for
30 minutes in the dark. Red fluorescence nucleic acid staining was measured using a plate
reader (Molecular Probes).
Transwell Migration and Invasion Assays
Cells (5×104) were seeded on 8-µm pore size Transwell filters (Corning) in regular growth
media or low-serum media (0.2% FBS). Invasion chambers coated with Matrigel (Corning)
were used for invasion assays with cells plated in regular growth media. Two days after
seeding, cells on top of the chamber were stripped off with cotton tips and cells on the
bottom of the chambers were fixed in 4% PFA and stained with crystal violet.
Real-time qRT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare).
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR green in an ABI PRISM 7500
sequence detection system with 96-block module and automation accessory (Applied
Biosystems). Gapdh was used as an internal control gene. The primers used are shown
below: Gapdh: 5′- TGGTGAAGCAGGCATCTGAG -3′ and 5′TGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG -3′. Etv4: 5′- CGACTCAGATGTCCCTGGAT-3′ and 5′GGAATGGTCGAAGGGATTTT -3′. Mycn: 5′- GATGAGGATGACGAGGAGGA-3′ and

and 5′-CAAAGCAAGTCTCTTCAGGCTCAG -3′.
TOPflash Assay
Vec or Wnt2-NB508 cells were infected with lentivirus carrying 7TFP construct and
selected with puromycin. Cells were plated in 96-well plate at 5×103 cells per well. Small
molecule reagents were added into media 1 day after plating and cells were imaged in the
IVIS Lumina II (Caliper Life Science) the following day.
Low quantity high throughput qRT-PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA was isolated from adherent monolayer cells and tumour spheres cultured in nonadherent plate using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out
using 200ng of RNA with SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s protocol. Preamplification of cDNA was done with 1.25 µl of cDNA using pooled 48 TaqMan Assays at
a final concentration of 0.2X for each assay. The pre-amplification PCR was performed at
one cycle 95°C for 10 min, 14 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and then 60°C for 4 min. After preamplification PCR, the product was diluted 1:5 with dH2O and stored at −80°C until needed.
qPCR was carried out using the 48.48 dynamic array (Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA)
following the manufacturer's protocol.
