ABSTRACT
Fatal influenza outcomes result from a combination of rapid virus replication and
collateral lung tissue damage caused by exaggerated pro-inflammatory host immune
cell responses. There are few therapeutic agents that target both biological processes
for the attenuation of influenza-induced lung pathology. We show that Saikosaponin
A, a bioactive triterpene saponin with previously established anti-inflammatory
effects, demonstrates both in vitro and in vivo anti-viral activity against influenza
A virus infections. Saikosaponin A attenuated the replication of three different
influenza A virus strains, including a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, in human alveolar
epithelial A549 cells. This anti-viral activity occurred through both downregulation
of NF-κB signaling and caspase 3-dependent virus ribonucleoprotein nuclear export
as demonstrated by NF-κB subunit p65 and influenza virus nucleoprotein nuclear
translocation studies in influenza virus infected A549 cells. Critically, Saikosaponin
A also attenuated viral replication, aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine production
and lung histopathology in the widely established H1N1 PR8 model of influenza A
virus lethality in C57BL/6 mice. Flow cytometry studies of mouse bronchoalveolar
lavage cells revealed that SSa exerted immunomodulatory effects through a selective
attenuation of lung neutrophil and monocyte recruitment during the early peak of
the innate immune response to PR8 infection. Altogether, our results indicate that
Saikosaponin A possesses novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of pathological
influenza virus infections.

INTRODUCTION

to current treatments. Fatality rates from seasonal IAV
strains are the highest within elderly ( > 65 years) and
young ( < 5 years) age groups [1, 2] whereas otherwise
healthy young adults are disproportionately affected by
fatal pandemic IAV infections [3]. Although vaccination
strategies are well-established for influenza prevention
and control, seasonal IAV vaccines exhibit decreased

Influenza A virus (IAV) infection remains a
global health burden due to both seasonal IAV disease
susceptibilities in young, chronically afflicted and
elderly populations and the potential re-emergence of
highly fatal pandemic IAV strains which do not respond

efficacies in elderly individuals [4] and a prophylactic
response against pandemic IAV strains can be delayed by
lengthy vaccine production cycles. Antiviral agents are
the current standard for primary care in highly susceptible
individuals, although treatment efficacy decreases with
delayed administration times [5] and sporadic resistance
is possible [6, 7]. Thus, the identification of novel antiIAV agents against influenza induced disease pathology
remains an urgent healthcare priority.
Severe pneumonia is a common cause of primary
IAV-related morbidities and mortalities, especially for
pandemic IAV strains. IAV infection begins in the upper
respiratory track epithelial cells [8] and spreads into the
deeper regions of the lung parenchyma [9]. At the same
time, pro-inflammatory responses are initiated by the host
and involve the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6) and chemokines (KC,
MIP-1α, MIP-2, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10) which facilitate
the initial phase of innate immune cell recruitment into
the lungs, typically from day 1 to 5 post-infection [10].
Although pro-inflammatory responses are critical for
the early control of viral replication [11], excessive
inflammation also increases the level of tissue damaging
cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic products in the lungs [12].
In particular, heightened lung neutrophil and monocyte
numbers have been causally linked to the development
of severe pneumonia in mouse models of lethal IAV
infections [13, 14], although complete abrogation of these
immune cells also profoundly impairs host IAV clearance
[11, 14]. Thus, novel anti-IAV pharmaceutical agents
must navigate a critical balance between the engagement
of sufficient innate immune cell signaling to control
IAV propagation and the attenuation of excessive proinflammatory and tissue damaging effectors.
NF-κB signaling is rapidly initiated in response to
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) sensing
and promotes the transcription of a diverse array of genes
including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
immunomodulatory growth factors and cell surface
receptors [15]. Due to its rapid ability to induce gene
transcription, NF-κB signaling is often simultaneously
appropriated by viral pathogens including IAV to enhance
viral replication efficiencies [16]. Interestingly, host cell
NF-κB activation is a prerequisite for IAV virus replication
as both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated
gene silencing of NF-κB signaling decreases IAV
propagation in vitro [17-19]. Given that NF-κB signaling
is also responsible for the aberrant pro-inflammatory
responses associated with fatal cases of IAV infection
[20], downregulation but not complete inhibition of this
signaling pathway may provide a novel ‘dual-hit’ strategy
for the attenuation of IAV-related lung pathology.
Saikosaponin A (SSa) is one of the major bioactive
triterpene saponins derived from the root of Bupleurum
chinense DC and constitutes approximately 100-300 mg/g
of its total chemical composition [21]. Other bioactive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

constituents of Radix Bupleurum include Saikosaponins
B, C and D (closely related triterpenoidal structures with
differing carbohydrate attachments to SSa), the pectic
polysaccharide Bupleuran 2IIc [22] and several lignans,
flavonoids and essential oils [23]. Crude extracts of
Radix Bupleurum have been historically prescribed as
a supportive treatment for acute respiratory infectionassociated pyrexia and analgesia as well as for chronic
hepatitis and some autoimmune diseases [23]. Given its
steroid-like chemical structure (Figure 1A) and reported
NF-κB inhibiting anti-inflammatory activities in vitro
and in vivo [24-27], we conducted a comprehensive
analysis of the effects of SSa on IAV propagation and
lung immunopathogenesis, especially in relation to
NF-κB signaling associated cellular pathways. SSa
attenuated the replication of three different IAV strains,
including a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, in A549 cells
through downregulation of NF-κB signaling and caspase
3-dependent virus ribonucleoprotein nuclear export.
Critically, Saikosaponin A also attenuated viral replication,
aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine production and lung
neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in the PR8 model of
influenza lethality in C57BL/6 mice.

RESULTS
SSa inhibits IAV replication in A549 cells
SSa cytotoxicity was first established using the MTT
viability assay on A549 cells and through monitoring of
body weight changes and adverse symptoms in SSa treated
B6 mice (Supplementary Figure 1). Minimal cytotoxicity
was observed for SSa concentrations ≤ 7.6 μΜ 48 h posttreatment on A549 cells in vitro (Supplementary Figure
1A) and 7.6 μΜ SSa hence selected as the maximal drug
concentration used for subsequent IAV infection studies.
Saikosaponin D, an epimer of SSa that also downregulates
LPS-induced NF-κB signaling [26], showed heightened
cytotoxicity levels in A549 cells compared to SSa (data not
shown) and was not therefore further investigated in our
study. To investigate for potential in vitro anti-IAV activity,
we first evaluated the effects of SSa on IAV propagation in
A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with three different
IAV strains of different pathogenicity levels (H1N1 PR8,
H9N2 and high pathogenicity H5N1) for 8, 24, 48 and 72
h post-infection and total cell and supernatant virus titres
calculated. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) has been
reported to inhibit in vitro and in vivo IAV viral replication
through downregulation of NF-κB signaling [18] and was
used as a positive control. IC50 values for the inhibition of
IAV replication were 1.98, 2.21 and 2.07 μM for H1N1
PR8, H9N2 and H5N1 strains respectively. For all three
IAV strains, SSa inhibited IAV replication in a dosedependent manner from 8, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection

SSa suppresses IAV-induced NF-κB activation in
A549 cells
During IAV infection, NF-κB is appropriated by
IAV for productive host cell infection and active NFκB signaling is required for IAV propagation itself [17].
To investigate whether SSa-mediated inhibition of IAV
replication was dependent on NF-κB signaling in high
pathogenicity H5N1 IAV infections, we examined the
effects of SSa treatment on NF-κB nuclear translocation
in H5N1-infected A549 cells. At steady state, NF-κB
predominantly exists as a heterodimer of RelA (p50) and
p65 subunits bound by an IκB inhibitor protein (usually
IκBα or IκBβ) which prevents nuclear translocation and
gene transcription [28]. Activation of NF-κB signaling is
mediated by the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB by
the IκB kinase complex, facilitating nuclear translocation
of RelA/p65 subunits where they bind to NF-κB promoter
regions and initiate gene transcription [28]. As expected,
H5N1 infection greatly increased nuclear but not cytosol
p65 levels at 24 h post-infection compared to noninfected controls, demonstrating IAV-induced activation
of NF-κB signaling (Figure 2A and 2B). SSa treatment
attenuated IAV-induced nuclear p65 translocation (Figure
2A and 2B). Consistent with attenuated p65 nuclear
translocation, SSa treatment also decreased the level of
IAV-induced IκBα degradation in infected A549 cells
(Figure 2D and 2E). Immunofluorescence studies further
confirmed decreased p65 nuclear translocation in SSa
treated H5N1-infected A549 cells at 8 h post-infection
compared to untreated controls (Figure 2D). SSa addition
itself did not affect p65 nuclear translocation similar to
non-infected (mock) A549 cells (Figure 2D) although a
modest but statistically significant increase in cytosolic
p65 expression was observed at 7.6 µM.

SSa attenuates nuclear export
ribonucleoproteins in A549 cells

viral

Nuclear export of newly assembled viral
ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cytosol is required
for the final assembly and release of IAV progeny virions
[29, 30]. Interestingly, this process is dependent on proapoptotic caspase 3 activation [31, 32]. Cytosolic transport
of vRNPs, reflected by cytosolic IAV nucleoprotein
(NP) staining, was observed at 8 h post-H5N1 infection
in A549 cells (Figure 3A). Cytosolic NP levels were
decreased following SSa treatment 8 h post-IAV
infection compared to untreated controls. (Figure 3A).
Consistent with published findings, IAV infected MCF7 cells that lack functional caspase 3 showed negligible
cytosolic NP transport in the absence or presence of
SSa (Supplementary Figure 2). Poly-(ADP-ribose)-

polymerase (PARP) is a classical substrate of caspase
3 and PARP cleavage was increased following H5N1
infection, suggesting increased caspase activity (Figure
3B). SSa treatment decreased PARP cleavage in H5N1infected A549 cells (Figure 3B). Cleaved (active) caspase
3, however, was not detectable by western blotting even
in H5N1-infected positive controls (data not shown),
which may reflect low protein yields or the immortalized
properties of A549 cells.

SSa cytotoxicity was assessed in vivo and minimal
weight loss and adverse symptoms (signs of hunching,
unresponsiveness, piloerection, altered respiratory rates
and alopecia) were observed in C57BL/6 (B6) mice

administered 50 mg/kg/d compared to 100 and 200 mg/
kg/d of SSa subcutaneously for 6 consecutive days
(Supplementary Figure 1B). 50 mg/kg/d of SSa was
therefore chosen as the maximal drug dose administered
to IAV-infected B6 mice.
PR8 is a mouse-adapted IAV strain widely used
to model lethal IAV infections and causes up to 90%
mortality in B6 mice within 10 days following infection
at 500 pfu/mouse. B6 mice treated with 25 mg/kg/d and
50 mg/kg/d SSa showed significantly decreased mortality
rates compared to 12.5 mg/kg/d SSa and PBS control
groups following infection with 500 pfu of PR8 (Figure
4A). This correlated with a corresponding reduction in
weight loss following PR8 infection in 25 mg/kg/d and
50 mg/kg/d SSa treated B6 mice (Figure 4B) and 25 mg/

kg/d was chosen as the optimal treatment dose for all
further IAV studies as 50 mg/kg/d SSa still elicited modest
weight loss in B6 mouse toxicity studies (Supplementary
Figure 1B). Similar to in vitro findings, SSa administration
decreased total lung tissue viral titres at day 4 and 6 postPR8 infection (Figure 4C). Critically, lung histology
showed an attenuation of inflammatory infiltrates in the
parenchyma, airways and interstitial regions of the lungs
following SSa treatment in PR8-infected B6 mice (Figure
4D). SSa treatment (25 mg/kg/d) alone did not induce any
pathological changes in lung tissue compared to that of
untreated B6 mice or treated PBS controls (Figure 4D).
As ASA inhibited IAV virus replication in vitro similarly
or more effectively than SSa, we also examined the effects
of ASA administration following lethal PR8 infections

in B6 mice (Supplementary Figure 3A). Interestingly,
ASA did not significantly reduce PR8-induced morbidity
or mortality compared to SSa, suggesting that SSa
efficacy may also be potentially attributed to other antiinflammatory effects rather than anti-viral activity alone
(Supplementary Figure 3B and 3C). SSa administration 24
h prior to and 24 h but not 72 h following PR8 infection

was also protective against PR8-induced mortality in B6
mice (Supplementary Figure 3D), suggesting early control
of IAV replication and/or tissue damaging mediators
as potential mechanisms of SSa-mediated anti-IAV
protection.

monocyte recruitment following lethal PR8
infection in mice

in response to IAV infection and peak in numbers around
day 3 post-infection [33], when lung monocyte and natural
killer (NK) cell recruitment also increases. SSa treatment
significantly decreased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
neutrophil and monocyte but not AMФ numbers by day
3 post-infection compared to PBS controls (Figure 4E4G). Differences in NK, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers
were not statistically significant, although a trend towards

SSa treated PR8-infected mice (Supplementary Figure
4A). The attenuation of lung neutrophil and monocyte
recruitment in SSa treated mice was not due to a systemic
suppression of neutrophil or monocyte production
(Supplementary Figure 4B-4G) with bone marrow
neutrophil numbers conversely increased in SSa treated
mice at day 3 post-PR8 infection. No differences existed
in BAL neutrophil and monocyte CD11b or CD11a
surface expression either, indicating that impairment of
endothelial cell transmigration was not responsible for the
reduction in SSa-mediated BAL neutrophil and monocyte
numbers. To confirm that the immunomodulatory effects

of SSa treatment were not confined to PR8 infection itself,
we also investigated its effects on influenza A/X-31 (X-31)
infected B6 mice at day 3 post-infection (Supplementary
Figure 5). SSa treatment ameliorated X-31-induced weight
loss in B6 mice (Supplementary Figure 5A) and this was
associated with a selective reduction in BAL neutrophil
numbers (Supplementary Figure 5B and 5C). A trend
for decreased monocyte recruitment was also observed,
although this did not reach statistical significance
(Supplementary Figure 5B and 5C).

the levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MIP-1α and IL10 present in the lungs of non-infected B6 mice (Figure 5).

SSa attenuates lung immune cell apoptosis
following lethal PR8 infection in mice

Heightened production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines is a hallmark of lethal IAV
infections and correlates clinically with increased IAV
pathogenicity [34-36]. SSa treatment reduced BAL
IFN-γ production at all time points tested following
PR8 infection (Figure 5A). During IAV infection, lung
monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells are
also a steady source of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as TNF- α and IL-6 [14, 37]. In parallel with decreased
lung monocyte infiltration, SSa treatment attenuated PR8induced IL-6 production in the lungs at all time points
studied and attenuated TNF-α production from days 2
and 4 following PR8 infection (Figure 5B-5C). A modest
attenuation of IL-1β and MIP-1α also occurred at day 4
and from day 6 onwards respectively in SSa treated PR8infected B6 mice (Figure 5D and 5E). No significant
differences in IL-10 production were observed between
SSa treated and PBS control mice at all time points
following PR8 infection (Figure 5F). Parallel with lung
histology findings, SSa administration alone did not alter

Immune cell modulation can directly alter the
consequences of IAV pathogenesis independent of
anti-viral targeting [14, 38]. To examine whether SSa
attenuated in vivo IAV propagation through similar
functional pathways as demonstrated in vitro, active
caspase 3 and cytosolic NP expression were also quantified
in BAL cells from SSa and PBS control treated B6 mice at
day 3 post-PR8 infection (Figure 6). Total cleaved (active)
caspase 3 expression was attenuated in BAL cells from
SSa treated B6 mice compared to PBS controls (Figure
6A and 6B). Interestingly, a higher proportion of lung
monocytes were positive for active caspase 3 expression
in PBS control compared to SSa treated PR8-infected mice
(Figure 6C), suggesting that monocyte apoptosis may be
more prominent in lethal IAV pathogenesis. Concordant
with our in vitro observations and in vivo IAV titre studies,
decreased cytosolic NP expression was also observed

Figure 7: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of SSa-induced attenuation of IAV pathogenesis. IAV infection triggers

host cell activation of the NFκB signaling pathway following endosomal (TLR) and cytosolic (MAVS) IAV sensing. SSa directly inhibits
IκB degradation and p65 nuclear translocation in vitro, decreases caspase 3-dependent IAV vRNP export in vitro and in vivo and attenuates
NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production and lung neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in vivo.

in BAL cells of SSa compared to PBS control treated
mice (Figures 6D). A trend for decreased total cellular
NP expression was also observed although this was not
statistically significant between SSa and PBS control
treated mice (Figure 6E). Critically, BAL cells with high
NP expression were also frequently positive for active
caspase 3 expression in PBS control but not SSa treated
mice (Figure 6D).
Overall, we have demonstrated that SSa directly
suppresses IAV propagation through inhibition of NFκB signaling in vitro and is protective in the PR8 mouse
model of IAV lethality. This occurred through the
attenuation of NF-κB associated inflammatory pathways
such as pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release
and downstream lung innate immune cell recruitment, as
well as a modest decrease in caspase 3 associated IAV
propagation (Figure 7).

[41]. Altogether, our observations suggest that the
immunomodulatory effects of SSa treatment is linked
to the selective suppression of excessive early lung
neutrophil and monocyte numbers, highlighting their
potential as a therapeutic target against IAV-induced
severe pneumonia.
Many viruses (HIV-1, HBV, HBC, CMV and IAV)
can directly activate and appropriate host cell NF-κB
signaling to enhance viral replication [16], a pathway
similarly activated by oncogenic viruses such as EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) for neoplastic cell transformation [42].
Upon infection, IAV activates a complex network of
endosomal and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) such as TLR-3 and TLR-7 (toll-like receptors),
and RIG-I and MDA-5 (RIG-I-like receptors) which
then activates NF-κB signaling for the induction of
pro-inflammatory host cell defence mechanisms [10,
43]. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling
is preferentially upregulated following IAV sensing
compared to anti-viral interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3
and IRF-7 signaling pathways which are also downstream
of TLR and RLR activation [19]. This may reflect a
self-beneficial dependency on NF-κB signaling by IAV.
Indeed, apart from directly enhancing cRNA promoter
dependent vRNA transcription [19], NF-κB activation is
also appropriated by IAV to upregulate host cell SOCS-3
expression which suppresses the production of anti-viral
IFN-α/β [44]. As heightened NF-κB signaling is also a
lethal signature of highly pathogenic IAV strains such as
H5N1 [20], the modulation of NF-κB signaling pathways
to suppress IAV propagation is an attractive therapeutic
target against IAV-induced morbidity and mortality.
ASA (an IκBα kinase inhibitor), BAY11-7085 (an
inhibitor of TNF-α induced IκBα phosphorylation) and
SC75741 (an inhibitor of NF-κB p65 DNA binding)
have all been demonstrated to inhibit IAV replication in
vitro [17, 18]. Treatment with ASA [18] and SC75741
[45] also inhibited IAV replication in mice although
aerosolic ASA administration did not alter IAV-induced
mortality or morbidity following lethal PR8 IAV infection
similar to our observations. SSa is a lipophilic triterpene
saponin derived from Radix Bupleurum with established
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties
[24-27, 46]. Therapeutically, SSa has been reported
to attenuate M-CSF and RANKL-mediated osteoclast
generation in bone marrow monocytes chiefly through
the inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation (decreasing NFκB mediated gene transcription) and p38, ERK and JNK
phosphorylation (decreasing activation of the mitogenactivation protein kinase pathway; MAP kinase pathway)
[24]. The suppression of both pathways by SSa has
also been linked to the attenuation of low-grade proinflammatory cytokine production in adipocytes [27] and
LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 (mouse macrophage) cells
[25, 26], in agreement with our own observations that
SSa-mediated anti-viral activity occurred through the

DISCUSSION
There are few therapeutic agents that can
successfully ablate the progression of severe IAV-induced
pneumonia. Patient mortality rates are approximately
60% even with anti-viral therapy and anti-viral drug
resistant IAV mutations have been reported in patient
subpopulations [6], prompting the need for alternative
therapeutic strategies that do not directly target the
virus and promote the selection of resistant IAV strains.
Mechanistically, as heightened virus proliferation and proinflammatory innate immune responses are concurrently
linked to the severity of IAV-induced lung pathogenesis
[13, 35, 39], the discovery of new therapeutic agents that
can indirectly inhibit IAV replication whilst attenuating
tissue-damaging pro-inflammatory host responses
remains a critical priority. The need to therapeutically
fine-tune rather than completely abrogate this latter
event is emphasised by recent animal studies showing
unaltered or conversely increased IAV-induced mortality
rates following complete removal of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, lung neutrophils or monocytes that correlate
with IAV-induced disease severity [10, 14, 34]. Lung
neutrophils release proteases, extracellular traps and
reactive oxygen species [40] and create a cytotoxic
environment which limits IAV spread at the cost of
bystander host cell injury. The same compromise exists
for lung monocytes, which directly contribute to IAVinduced morbidity and mortality yet are also required for
the priming of effective anti-IAV CD8+ T cell responses
[14, 38]. In our study, SSa treatment partially attenuated
lung neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in response to
lethal PR8 infection without impairing systemic neutrophil
and monocyte development. Attenuated lung neutrophil
responses were also observed following sublethal X-31
infection whilst AMΦ numbers were unaltered following
either PR8 or X-31 infection, in agreement with their
conversely protective effects following IAV infection

inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation in IAV-infected A549
cells. As MAP kinase activation is also appropriated by
IAV to inhibit protein kinase R dependent suppression of
vRNA translation [47], it will be interesting to investigate
whether this signaling pathway is also modulated by SSa
to confer its anti-viral effects.
In vitro and in vivo evidence of SSa mediated antiviral activity was directly demonstrated by virus growth
inhibition studies in A549 cells and mouse lung tissue
viral titres as well as immunofluorescence studies of
caspase-3 associated NP translocation in both settings.
Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB signaling is known
to decrease IAV replication through both the suppression
of caspase-mediated vRNP nuclear export [17-19, 31] as
well as vRNA synthesis itself. The former mechanism
was suggested by our studies as in vitro SSa treatment
decreased nuclear translocation of IAV NP and inhibited
IAV-induced cleavage of PARP, a classical substrate
for caspase 3, following H5N1 infection in A549 cells.
Critically, attenuated cleaved caspase 3 expression
was also observed in BAL cells from SSa but not PBS
control treated B6 mice, and this was linked to a trend
in attenuated total IAV NP expression. Currently, the
mechanistic link between caspase 3 activation and vRNP
nuclear export remains unclear, although caspases have
been demonstrated to disrupt the stability of nuclear pores
restricting protein nuclear entry [48, 49], which would in
turn allow the nuclear export of viral RNPs.
Critically in this study, SSa treatment protected
against lethal PR8 IAV-induced disease morbidity and
mortality. PR8 (H1N1) is a highly pathogenic IAV strain
which mimics pandemic IAV infections particularly
well as both infections can trigger severe primary viral
pneumonia (involving extensive airway inflammation,
hyaline membrane formation, haemorrhaging, oedema
and intra-alveolar and interstitial immune cell infiltration).
This severe response is attributed to a combination of
rapid IAV replication and enhanced recruitment of proinflammatory lung immune cells, notably neutrophils and
monocytes, which release pro-inflammatory mediators
such as TNF-α and IL-6 [11, 13]. Lung neutrophil and
monocyte recruitment and pro-inflammatory lung cytokine
production were both attenuated in SSa but not PBS
control treated B6 mice following PR8. SSa treatment
suppressed IFN-γ, IL-6 and early TNF-α but not IL1β or IL-10 production in PR8 infected mice, which is
advantageous as the latter are linked to the generation of
protective adaptive immune responses against IAV [50]
and the resolution of inflammation [51]. Lung monocytes
are prominent sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines
TNF-α and IL-6 [37, 52], which may explain why proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are positively
correlated, but not causative, to IAV lethality [34].
However, as viral titres are also positively correlated with
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, a secondary reduction
in pro-inflammatory cytokine produced subsequent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to enhanced anti-viral activity cannot be ruled out in
our study. Interestingly, though also disappointingly,
administration of SSa more than 72 hours post IAV
infection abolished the protective effects of SSa against
PR8 infection, suggestive of early anti-viral and/or proinflammatory events (< day 3-4 post-infection) as the main
targets of SSa treatment.
The extraction of other bioactive compounds from
plant-derived indigenous remedies is an area of potential
pharmacological gain. Other bioactive constituents of
Radix Bupleurum include Saikosaponins B, C and D,
the mitogenic pectic polysaccharide Bupleuran 2IIc
[22] and several lignans, flavonoids and essential oils
[23]. Saikosponin B2 has been demonstrated to directly
inhibit hepatitis C virus entry and cell membrane fusion
[53] whilst Saikosponin D is also associated with
the inhibition of NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory
cytokine production [26, 54] and T cell activation [55].
Some conflicting reports exist, however, over whether
Saikosponin A and D are bona fide broad-spectrum
inhibitors of inflammation-associated immune cells or
can conversely also activate residential tissue macrophage
and dendritic cell populations [56, 57]. In our studies, SSa
administration attenuated lung neutrophil and monocyte
recruitment without altering residential AMΦ numbers,
suggesting a more selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory
innate immune cell recruitment. However, more thorough
dissections of the therapeutic effects of Saikosponin A
and D on residential immunomodulatory immune cell
populations (such as tissue macrophages and regulatory T
cells) compared to pro-inflammatory innate immune cells
will be beneficial, especially as the former cell types are
critical for immune cell and organ homeostasis. This is
important as constitutive NF-κB signaling also activates
aberrant pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways
promoting chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis [58],
especially in relation to oncogenic viruses, and novel
inhibitors of NF-κB may be therapeutically beneficial for
diverse indications at doses which minimise disruptions
in homeostatic immune cell signaling and other adverse
effects.
In summary, we have demonstrated that SSa
effectively attenuates IAV replication, including that of a
highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV strain in vitro, through the
inhibition of NF-κB signaling and caspase 3 dependent NP
nuclear translocation. SSa administration also protected
against lethal PR8-induced mortality and morbidity in
vivo through the attenuation but not complete abrogation
of lung neutrophil and monocyte recruitment as well as
decreases in IAV replication, lung tissue pro-inflammatory
cytokine production and caspase 3 associated NP
nuclear translocation. To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive report of the anti-IAV efficacy of SSa and
our study demonstrates that SSa may possess therapeutic
potential especially in the treatment of high pathogenicity
influenza virus infections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Co. (Utah, USA). For in vitro experiments, SSa and
ASA were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
and diluted with DMEM to < 0.4% DMSO. For in vivo
experiments, SSa was prepared as oil emulsions consisting
of 50 mg SSa dissolved in 200 μl DMSO, followed by the
addition of 4.75 ml olive oil and 50 μl Tween 80. 5 ml
of sterile endotoxin free water was then gradually added
to the solution in an ultrasonic bath to a final SSa stock
concentration of 5 mg/ml. PBS control solutions were
similarly prepared as oil emulsions using starting volumes
of 50 μl PBS mixed in 200 μl DMSO. ASA oil emulsions
were also similarly prepared as SSa oil emulsions using
starting amounts of 50 mg aspirin dissolved in 200 μl
DMSO.

Cell lines and IAV strains
A549 cells (a human alveolar adenocarcinoma cell
line), Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) and
MCF-7 cells (a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line)
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM, Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS) with 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of
streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, mouse passaged
H1N1) virus was obtained from the Chinese Centre for
Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China) and from
(Melbourne, Australia), respectively. Avian influenza A/
Duck/Guangdong/99 (H5N1) virus and A/Chicken/
Guangdong/v/2008 (H9N2) virus were kindly provided
by the Veterinary Technology Centre of South China
Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China). Influenza
A/X-31 (X-31, mouse passaged H3N2) virus was kindly
provided by Prof Lorene Brown (Melbourne, Australia).
New viral stocks of IAV were passaged in 10 day old
embryonic chicken eggs for 48 to 72 h. Allantoic fluid was
collected and stored at -80°C until required. Experiments
involving H5N1 virus strains were conducted in a physical
containment level three (PC3) laboratory.

Virus growth inhibition assay
The virus growth inhibition assay was performed
to compare the in vitro inhibition of IAV replication by
all drug compounds. A549 cell monolayers were infected
with 100 TCID50 of influenza virus (to ensure a consistent
tissue culture infectious dose for each IAV strain) and
incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Supernatants were removed
and media containing different concentrations of each
drug compound then added. Cells and supernatants were
then collected at 8, 24, 48, 72 h post-infection and in total
subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles at -80°C and 37°C
respectively to ensure maximal release of cellular virions.
Final supernatant viral titres were determined by the end
point dilution assay using MDCK cells and expressed as
log10 TCID50/0.1ml [60]. The IC50 value (concentration of
compound required to inhibit progeny viral titres by 50%)
was determined by plotting the % inhibition of progeny
viral titres as a function of compound concentration.

Mice
Female C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from
Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Nanhai,
Guangdong, China) and the Walter Eliza Hall Institute
of Medical Research (Kew, Melbourne, VIC, Australia)
respectively. Mice were housed in specific pathogenfree (SPF) isolators. Experiments were performed in
mice 8-12 weeks old and respectively approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at South
China Agricultural University and the La Trobe University
Animal Ethics Committee in accordance with the National
Health and Medical Research Council Australia code of
practice for the care and use of animals for scientific
purposes.

Immunoblotting
For detection of NF-κB (p65 subunit) levels in the
cytosol and nucleus, A549 cells were infected with H5N1
IAV (MOI = 0.1) for 1 h and then cultured in the presence
of SSa or DMEM media control. After 24 h incubation,
A549 cells were harvested and cytosolic and nuclear
proteins separated using a Nuclear-Cytosol Extraction
Kit ( Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). For
detection of total cell IκBα and poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) levels, A549 cells were lysed in Triton
X-100 sampling buffer and protein yields measured using a
protein dye (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Equal amounts
of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes
(Millipore, USA). Proteins were detected using mouse
or rabbit monoclonal antibodies. β-Actin rabbit mAb
(D6A8), NF-κB p65 rabbit mAb (D14E12) [61] and
IκBα mouse mAb (112B2) [62] were obtained from

mAb (5A5) [63] and Lamin B1 mouse mAb (8D1) were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA). Protein
bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Thermo Scientific, USA).

For lethal PR8 infections, B6 mice were infected
with 500 pfu of PR8 (in 30 μl PBS) intranasally
under methoxyflurane anaesthetic. Mice were then
subcutaneously injected (27G needle) with SSa, ASA
or PBS oil emulsion once a day for 6 consecutive days
starting from 4 h post-infection. Mice were daily weighed
and monitored for adverse symptoms and culled when
weight loss exceeded 25%.

Cell immunofluorescence studies
A549 cells grown on 15 mm cover slips (MatTek,
USA) were infected with H5N1 virus at 0.1 MOI for 1 h
and treated with SSa or media control. At indicated time
points, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X100
for 15 min, then either stained with a mouse monoclonal
antibody against the influenza A virus nucleoprotein
(NP) (clone #65, Immune Technology Corp, USA) or a
rabbit monoclonal antibody against NF-κB p65 (D14E12)
(Cell Signaling Technology Co., USA) in 1:200 dilution
at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor
488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling
Technology Co., USA, 1:1000 dilutions). Cell nuclei were
stained using 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI: 1
μg/ml) (Sigma Chemical Co., USA). Cells were analysed
using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM
710, Germany).
Mouse BAL cells were collected as previously
described [37] and 100,000 cells per chamber (in 100
μl RPMI + 10% FCS) were incubated for 30 mins in a
8 well μ-Slide chamber (ibidi) at 37°C, 5% CO2 before
fixation (4% PFA, 10 mins RT, 3 x 5 min PBS rinses).
Cells were then incubated with surface immune cell 1°
Abs where relevant (eBioscience rat anti-mouse CD11b
PeCy7 at 1:600 and BD Biosciences hamster anti-mouse
CD11c biotin at 1:300; 1 h RT) and then goat anti-rat
AF555 (Life technologies, 1:600) and streptavidin AF488
(Life technologies, 1:300) respectively for 30 mins RT.
For intracellular cleaved caspase 3 [64] and NP staining,
BAL cells were permeablized (0.2% saponin, 20 mins
RT), blocked with 10% goat serum (Jackson laboratories,
USA, in 0.2% saponin + 1% BSA, 1 h RT), then incubated
with 1° Abs (purified rabbit anti-mouse cleaved caspase 3
at 1:300, Cell Signaling; anti-NP mouse ascites at 1:1400,
2 h RT followed by 4 x 5 min in 0.2% saponin + 1% BSA
washes) and then 2° Abs (goat anti-rabbit AF647 at 1:600,
Life technologies and goat anti-mouse AF488 at 1:600,
Life technologies; 1 h RT). Cells were then washed (4 x 5
min in 0.2% saponin + 1% BSA washes) and incubated in
2 µg/ml Hoerchst 33342 (Life technologies, 10 mins RT)
before imaged in PBS. All images of were captured on a
Zeiss LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl
Zeiss AG). Images were visualised and quantified using
Imaris (Bitplane AG) and image contrast was increased
consistently across all samples was figure visualisation.

Lung histopathology
Mouse lungs were inflation fixed in 10% formalin
using a hand-held 5 ml syringe, and paraffin embedded.
4-6 µm thick whole lung sections were obtained and
stained with H&E. Photomicrographs of stained sections
were captured using x20 objectives (Zeiss, AXidskopz).

Lung tissue viral titres
Mouse lungs were removed, rinsed in PBS,
weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml of DMEM with
P/S (100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and centrifuged at 3200g for
5 min. Supernatants were then harvested for viral titre
determination using the end point dilution assay in MDCK
cells as described above.

Flow cytometry
Mouse BAL cells were collected as previously
described [37], filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh and
resuspended in FACS buffer (Mouse PBS, 2% FCS, 2
mM EDTA). Bone marrow (BM) and splenic cells were
harvested through the flushing of femurs and extrusion
of splenic cells with RPMI + 10% FCS using a 21G and
23G needle respectively, before single cell resuspension
in FACS buffer. Cells were first incubated with Fc block
(0.6 μg/ml, anti-mouse CD32/CD16, clone 2.4G2, BD
Biosciences) for 10 min on ice. Cells were then stained
with primary mAbs or isotype controls (Supplementary
Table 1) on ice for 20 min, washed with FACS buffer
and resuspended in 120 μl FACS buffer with 5 μl DAPI
solution (1 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) before analysis. All
FACS data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II (BD
Biosciences), and ≥ 50,000 live events collected per
sample. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software
(Windows V10, FlowJo LLC). Our flow cytometry gating
strategy for innate immune cells has been previously
described [65].
