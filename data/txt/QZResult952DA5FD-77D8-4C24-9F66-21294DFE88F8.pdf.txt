ABSTRACT
Aurora A and JAK2 kinases are involved in cell division and tumor cell survival,
respectively. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Aurora A and JAK2
together is more effective than each alone at inducing non-transformed cells to grow
in an anchorage-independent manner and to invade. Furthermore, siRNA silencing
or pharmacological inhibition of Aurora A and JAK2 with Alisertib and Ruxolitinib,
respectively, is more effective than blocking each kinase alone at suppressing
anchorage-dependent and –independent growth and invasion as well as at inducing
apoptosis. Importantly, we have developed dual Aurora and JAK inhibitors,
AJI-214 and AJI-100, which potently inhibit Aurora A, Aurora B and JAK2 in vitro. In
human cancer cells, these dual inhibitors block the auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A
(Thr-288) and the phosphorylation of the Aurora B substrate histone H3 (Ser-10)
and the JAK2 substrate STAT3 (Tyr-705). Furthermore, AJI-214 and AJI-100 inhibit
anchorage dependent and independent cell growth and invasion and induce G2/M cell
cycle accumulation and apoptosis. Finally, AJI-100 caused regression of human tumor
xenografts in mice. Taken together, our genetic and pharmacological studies indicate
that targeting Aurora A and JAK2 together is a more effective approach than each
kinase alone at inhibiting malignant transformation and warrant further advanced pre
clinical investigations of dual Aurora A/JAK2 inhibitors as potential anti tumor agents.

INTRODUCTION

of evidence implicate Aurora kinases in malignant
transformation [7–9]. Therefore, these kinases are highly
sought after as targets for the discovery of new anticancer
drugs and intense efforts have been made to prepare
specific pharmacological inhibitors [10]. For example,
ZM44743911 [11] and Hesperadin [12] are Aurora
kinase inhibitors that are more specific for Aurora B over
Aurora A [12, 13]. VX-680, also known as MK-0457, was
identified as a potent pan-Aurora inhibitor with Ki values
of 0.6, 18, and 4.6 nM for Aurora A, C and B, respectively
[14]. Although VX-680 has shown significant potential
as an anti-cancer agent pre clinically, it failed in clinical
trials due to cardiovascular side effects [15]. Other novel

The Aurora family members of serine/threonine
kinases, Aurora A, B and C, play key roles in the regulation
of cell division. Aurora A regulates chromosome
maturation and mitotic spindle formation, Aurora B
controls chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis
[1, 2] whereas Aurora C is involved in meiosis [3].
Aurora A, B and C kinases are found overexpressed in
solid tumors, including colorectal, breast, and ovarian
as well as leukemia [4, 5]. Over-expression of Aurora
kinases is reported to be associated with genetic
instability and tumor formation [6] and several lines

RESULTS

Aurora inhibitors that are undergoing clinical trials include
MLN8054 and MLN8237 (Alisertib) [16], AZD1152 [17]
and AT9283 (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Inhibition of Aurora
kinase primarily leads to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M
phase, but does not necessarily induce cell death.
Therefore, it remains unclear whether Aurora kinase
inhibitors will be effective as single agent or whether
they will need to be combined with other agents. Several
studies have reported on the benefits of combining Aurora
kinase inhibitors with other anti-cancer agents such as
cisplatin [18], temozolomide [19], taxanes [20], vorinostat
[21] and nilotinib [22]. One notable example is the Aurora
A inhibitor MLN8237, which overcomes resistance to
BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) [22].
The Janus kinases (JAK) family members, JAK1,
JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine
kinases that are required for signaling by receptors that
lack intrinsic kinase activity such as the receptor for
the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) [23]. Some of the
major substrates for the JAK family of kinases are the
Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription
(STAT) proteins [24, 25]. JAK/STAT pathways are
critically involved in the survival and proliferation
of many cancer types [24, 26]. Furthermore, in some
leukemias and myeloproliferative neoplasms, constitutive
JAK2 activation (V617F mutation) drives malignant
transformation [27] and this prompted a significant effort
in targeting JAK2 inhibition as a potential therapeutic
strategy. Ruxolitinib, a potent and selective JAK1/JAK2
inhibitor significantly inhibited interleukin-6 signaling and
proliferation of cells that harbor JAK2-V617F mutation
[28], and presently, is being investigated in clinic in
patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) [29].
While Aurora kinases are involved in cell division
and JAK2 kinase in tumor survival, whether these two
kinases cooperate to induce malignant transformation is
not known. Furthermore, it is not known whether human
cancer cells require Aurora A and JAK2 alone or together
to survive, to grow in an anchorage-dependent and –
independent manner as well as invade and metastasize.
In this manuscript, we demonstrate that Aurora A and
JAK2 together are more effective than each alone at
inducing non-transformed cells to grow in an anchorageindependent manner and invade. We also show that
genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of
Aurora A and JAK2 together is much more effective at
inhibiting anchorage-dependent and –independent growth
and invasion as well as at inducing apoptosis. Finally,
we developed dual Aurora and JAK2 inhibitors that
demonstrated potent inhibition of Aurora A, Aurora B and
JAK2 in intact human cancer cells, induction of G2/M cell
cycle accumulation and apoptosis as well as inhibition of
anchorage-dependent and –independent proliferation,
invasion and tumor growth in vivo.

Expression of Aurora A and JAK2 together
is more effective than each alone at inducing
non-transformed cells to grow in an anchorageindependent manner and invade.
While the potent antitumor activity of multi kinase
inhibitors such as AT9283 that inhibit Aurora A and JAK2
among other kinases suggested that dual targeting of
these two kinases is of benefit, direct evidence for this is
lacking. Furthermore, whether these two kinases cooperate
to induce malignant transformation is not known. To
address this important question, we first transfected
the non-transformed immortalized human pancreatic
normal epithelial (HPNE) cells with either empty vector,
Aurora A, JAK2 or Aurora A + JAK2 and determined the
ability of these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent
manner in soft agar and to invade through matrigel as
described under Materials and Methods. Figure 1A shows
that transfection of HPNE cells with Aurora A, JAK2 or
Aurora A + JAK2 resulted in an increase in the expression
of the corresponding proteins. Figure 1B shows that 26.3
colonies grew from empty vector transfected HPNE
cells. In contrast, HPNE cells transfected with Aurora A,
JAK2 and Aurora + JAK2 grew 54, 55, and 91 colonies,
respectively. Similarly, Figure 1C shows that the number
of HPNE cells that invaded following transfections with
empty vector, Aurora A, JAK2 and Aurora A + JAK2
were 234, 869, 563 and 1665, respectively. These results
demonstrate that Aurora A and JAK2 together are more
effective than each is alone at promoting anchorageindependent growth and invasion in HPNE cells.

Depletion of both Aurora A and JAK2 is highly
effective at inhibiting anchorage-dependent
and -independent growth and invasion and at
inducing apoptosis.
The results from Figure 1 suggested that Aurora
A and JAK2 may cooperate to induce malignant
transformation. To further support this suggestion,
we reasoned that combined suppression of these two
kinases may be more effective at inhibiting malignant
transformation. To this end, we first used siRNA to
deplete Aurora A, JAK2 or Aurora A + JAK2 in 8 human
cancer cell lines from different lineages; three from
breast (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7), two
from lung (A549 and H460), two from colon (HCT116
and HT29) and one from prostate (DU145); and
determined the effects of these depletions on anchoragedependent cell proliferation by MTT assays as described
under Materials and Methods. Supplemental Figure S1
shows that depletion of either kinase alone had little

Figure 1: Co-expression of Aurora-A and JAK2 is more effective than single expression at inducing malignant
transformation in HPNE cells. HPNE cells were transfected with vector, Aurora A, JAK2 or both Aurora A and JAK2 as described in

Materials and Methods. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and the resulting lysates were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies
(A), processed for soft agar growth assays (B) or invasion assays (C) as described in Materials and Methods. White, light gray, dark gray
and black colors represent vector, Aurora A (Aur), JAK2 and Aurora A + JAK2 (A+J), respectively. For the soft agar (B), the data are the
average +/- SE of three wells per condition. For the invasion (C), the data are the average +/- SE of three independent experiments. The data
for (A) and (B) are representative of three independent experiments, respectively.

effect on anchorage-dependent growth indicating that
none of the cell lines depends on Aurora A or JAK2
alone for proliferation. In 5 out of the 8 cell lines
(MCF-7, HCT-116, MDA-MB-231, H460 and A-549),
even co-depletion was not highly effective at inhibiting
anchorage-dependent growth. However, depleting
both Aurora A and JAK2 together was more effective
than depleting each alone in the remaining 3 cell lines
(MDA-MB-468, HT-29 and DU-145) (Figure S1).
We next focused on two of these cell lines,
MDA-MB-468 and HT-29, to determine the requirements

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Aurora A and JAK2 on survival, anchorage-independent
growth and invasion. To this end, we silenced Aurora A,
JAK2 or Aurora A + JAK2, and processed the cells for
Western immunoblotting, soft agar and invasion assays
as described in Materials and Methods. Figure 2A shows
that in MDA-MB-468, depletion of Aurora A, JAK2 and
Aurora A + JAK2 induced PARP cleavage relative to NT
by 9.0, 2.3 and 16.0 fold, respectively. Similarly, in HT-29
cells, depletion of Aurora A, JAK2 and Aurora A + JAK2
induced PARP cleavage relative to NT by 3.8, 1.4 and 8.5
fold, respectively. Thus, depletion of both kinases is more

effective than depleting each alone at inducing apoptosis
as measured by PARP cleavage.
Figure 2B shows that MDA-MB-468 cells
transfected with NT, siRNA to Aurora A, JAK2 and Aurora
A + JAK2 grew 382, 369, 365 and 165 soft agar colonies,
respectively. Thus, depleting MDA-MB-468 cells from
Aurora A, JAK2 or both resulted in 3.5%, 4.5% and 56.9%
inhibition of soft agar growth, respectively. Furthermore,
Figure 2B also shows that HT-29 cells transfected with
NT, siRNA to Aurora A, JAK2 and Aurora A + JAK2
grew 142, 49, 39 and 27 soft agar colonies, respectively.
Thus, depleting HT-29 cells from Aurora A, JAK2 or both
resulted in 65.5%, 72.6% and 81% inhibition of soft agar
growth. Therefore, the data suggest that the combination
knockdown of Aurora A and Jak2 kinases has divergent
effects on anchorage-independent growth. MDA-MB-468
cells do not appear to require each kinases alone but do
require both kinases for growth on soft agar. In contrast,
HT29 cells appear to require Aurora A and JAK2
individually for anchorage-independent growth.
We next determined the effect of knockdown of
Aurora A and JAK2 on invasion of MDA-MB-468 and
HT29 cells. Figure 2C shows that in MDA-MB-468
cells, 1031 cells invaded in the NT-transfected sample.
Transfection with JAK2 siRNA had very little effect on
invasion (994 invaded cells) whereas transfection with
Aurora A siRNA inhibited invasion by 41.3% (605 invaded
cells). Depletion of both kinases was more effective and
inhibited invasion by 63.6 % (375 invaded cells). Similar
results were obtained with HT29 cells where the number
of invading cells were 1815, 1994, 1140 and 717 in NT,
JAK2, Aurora A and Aurora + JAK2 transfected cells,
respectively. Thus, in both cell lines, knocking down
JAK2 had no effect but depleting both kinases was more
effective than each was alone.

Ruxolitinib inhibited anchorage-dependent proliferation in
a concentration dependent manner with IC 50 values for
Alisertib of 0.07 and 2.0 μM and for Ruxolitinib of 26.0
and 44.7 μM in MDA-MB-468 and HT29, respectively.
Figure S2B shows that treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells
with vehicle, Alisertib (0.05 μM), Ruxolitinib (35 μM) or
the combination inhibited proliferation by 25.4%, 51.2%
and 80.1%, respectively. Treatment of HT29 cells with
vehicle, Alisertib (0.05 μM), Ruxolitinib (20 μM) or the
combination inhibited proliferation by 5%, 14.3% and
45.4%, respectively. Thus, combination of Alisertib and
Ruxolitinib was more effective than single treatment at
inhibiting anchorage-dependent proliferation.
To determine the effects of these inhibitors on
apoptosis induction, we treated MDA-MB-468 and HT29
cells with various concentrations of Alisertib, Ruxolitinib
either alone or in combination and processed the cells
for Western blotting as described under Materials and
Methods. Figure 3A shows that treatment of MDAMB-468 and HT-29 cells with Alisertib (0.5 and 2 μM,
respectively) inhibited P-Histone H3 but not P-STAT3,
whereas treatment with Ruxolitinib (30 and 20 μM,
respectively) inhibited P-STAT3 but not P-Histone H3.
Figure 3B shows that in MDA-MB-468 cells, neither
Alisertib nor Ruxolitinib induced PARP cleavage when
used as single agents at low concentrations (for example,
Alisertib (0.03 μM) and Ruxolitinib (0.4 μM). However,
when these low concentrations were used in combination
they induced PARP cleavage (Figure 3B). Similar results
were obtained with HT-29 cells (Figure 3B). Thus,
consistent with the anchorage-dependent proliferation
results of Figure S2, pharmacological inhibition of Aurora
A and JAK2 combined is more effective than single kinase
inhibition at inducing apoptosis.
We next determined whether combination treatment
with Alisertib and Ruxolitinib is more effective than single
agent treatment toward inhibiting anchorage-independent
growth of MDA-MB-468 and HT-29 cells in soft agar
as described under Materials and Methods. Figure 3C
shows MDA-MB-468 cells treated with vehicle, Alisertib
(0.5 μM), Ruxolitinib (30 μM) or both compounds grew
131, 67, 100, and 34 colonies, respectively. Thus, the
combination was more effective (74%) than Alisertib
(49%) and Ruxolitinib (23.7%) at inhibiting anchorageindependent growth. Figure 3C also shows that HT-29
cells treated with vehicle, Alisertib (2 μM), Ruxolitinib
(20  μM) or both compounds had 129, 56 (56.6%
inhibition), 72 (44.2% inhibition), and 7 colonies (94.6%
inhibition), respectively.
Next, we determined the effects of the combination
treatment of Alisertib and Ruxolitinib on invasion of
MDA-MB-468 and HT-29 cells, using Matrigel coated
Transwell cell culture chambers as described under
Materials and Methods. Figure 3D shows that MDAMB-468 cells treated with vehicle, Alisertib (0.5 μM),

Combination treatment with the Aurora A
inhibitor Alisertib and the JAK2 inhibitor
Ruxolitinib is more effective than single
treatment at inhibiting anchorage-dependent
and -independent proliferation and invasion and
at inducing apoptosis.
Figure 2 demonstrated that depleting Aurora A and
JAK2 together is more effective than depleting each alone
at suppressing malignant transformation. We next used
a pharmacological approach to further investigate the
effects of inhibiting these 2 kinases alone and together
on malignant transformation. To this end, we first treated
MDA-MB-468 and HT29 cells with various concentrations
of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor Alisertib and the JAK2
inhibitor Ruxolitinib and determined their IC50 values for
anchorage-dependent growth as described under Methods.
Supplemental Figure S2A shows that Alisertib and

Figure 2: Depletion of Aurora A and JAK2 kinases is highly effective at inducing apoptosis and at inhibiting anchorageindependent growth and invasion. MDA-MB-468 and HT-29 cells were transfected with NT siRNA, Aurora A siRNA, JAK2 siRNA
or siRNAs to both aurora A and JAK2, and processed for Western blotting (A), soft agar (B) or invasion (C) assays as described under
Materials and Methods. For the soft agar (B), the data are the average +/- SE of three wells per condition. For the invasion (C), the data

respectively.

Ruxolitinib (30 μM) or both compounds had 344,

In HT-29 cells, treatment with vehicle, Alisertib (4 μM),

Discovery of AJI-214 and AJI-100, highly potent
small-molecule dual inhibitors of Aurora and
JAK2 kinases

yielded highly potent chlorophenyl substituted pyrimidinebased Aurora kinase inhibitors [30]. Two analogues,
AJI-214 and AJI-100 (Figure 4) were identified as dual
inhibitors of Aurora A and JAK2 kinases. The two
analogues differ only by a single substitution of a chlorine
in AJI-214 by a hydrogen in the ortho position of the
phenyl ring A of AJI-100 (Figure 4). AJI-214 and AJI-100
inhibited Aurora A in vitro (IC50 = 5.7 nM and 5.4 nM) and
Aurora B (15.6 nM and 14.0 nM) (Figure 4). In addition,
both inhibitors also inhibited potently JAK2 (33.4 nM and
51 nM) (Figure 4). To determine whether the two analogues
inhibit their targets in intact cancer cells, we treated
MDA-MB-468 cells with increasing concentrations of

Figure 1 provided evidence for the cooperation
between Aurora A and JAK2 to induce malignant
transformation, whereas Figures 2 and 3 demonstrated using
2 approaches, genetic knockdown and pharmacological
inhibition, that blocking these 2 kinases together is more
effective than blocking each alone at suppressing malignant
transformation. These results prompted us to develop dual
Aurora A and JAK2 inhibitors. To this end, recently our
in-house chemistry and structural biology efforts have

(Thr288) antibody as described under Materials and Methods. VX-680 was used as a control for Aurora-A inhibition. (B) MDA-MB-468

and GAPDH antibodies as described under Materials and Methods. (C) MDA-MB-468 Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with
the indicated concentrations of AJI-214 and AJI-100 for 48 h and processed for MTT assays as described in “Materials and Methods”. The

phosphorylation of STAT3 but not that of Histone H3
or the auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A (Figure S3).
Similar results were obtained in HEL leukemia cells
that harbor a JAK2-V617F mutation and the resulting
hyper-phosphorylated STAT3 on Tyr-705 (Figure S3C).
Furthermore, AJI-214 is selective for Aurora and JAK2
over other kinases as demonstrated by the observation that
it did not decrease the levels of P-Akt and P-Erk (Figure
S3B). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the
novel dual inhibitors AJI-214 and AJI-100 potently inhibit
the activities of Aurora A, Aurora B and JAK2 in intact
human cancer cells.

In addition, Figures 2 and 3 demonstrated the benefits
of inhibiting both Aurora A and JAK2 at suppressing
malignant transformation. Therefore, we next determined
the effects of these dual inhibitors on anchorage-dependent
and -independent tumor cell growth, apoptosis, invasion
and cell cycle progression as described under Materials and
Methods. Figure 5C shows that AJI-214 and AJI-100
inhibited MDA-MB-468 anchorage-dependent growth
in a concentration dependent manner with IC50 values
of 4.6 and 3.6 μM, respectively. Next, we evaluated
whether the inhibitors can induce apoptosis by treating
MDA-MB-468 cells with the inhibitors and processing
the cells for Caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage
by Western blotting as described under Materials and
Methods. Figure 5B shows that the two inhibitors induced
Caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage in a dosedependent manner. The ability of AJI-214 and AJI-100
to inhibit anchorage–independent growth was evaluated
in soft agar as described under Materials and Methods.
Figure 6A shows that AJI-214 and AJI-100 inhibited

AJI-214 and AJI-100 inhibit anchoragedependent and –independent cell growth and
invasion as well as induce apoptosis in human
cancer cells
Figures 4, 5A and 5B demonstrated that AJI-214
and AJI-100 are potent dual Aurora and JAK2 inhibitors.

Figure 6: Aurora A and JAK2 dual inhibitors are highly effective at inhibiting anchorage-independent growth and
invasion as well as in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice. MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with

vehicle control, AJI-214 or AJI-100 and the cells were processed for soft agar (A) and invasion (B) assays as described under Materials
and Methods. For the soft agar (A), the data are the average +/- SE of three wells per condition. For the invasion (B), the data are from
one invasion chamber per condition. The data for (A) and (B) are representative of three and two independent experiments. (C and D)

(5 μM) and AJI-100 (5 μM) for 48 hr had 723, 252 (65.2%

of MDA-MB-468 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle. AJI-214 also induced G2/M accumulation (4-fold
increase) in HeLa cells (data not show). Furthermore, the
Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 but not the JAK2 inhibitor
Ruxolitinib induced a significant G2/M accumulation in
the same MDA-MB-468 cells under the same conditions
(data not shown), suggesting that AJI-214 mediated-G2/M
accumulation is mainly dependent on its ability to inhibit
Aurora not JAK2.

inhibition of these 2 kinases contributes to the anti tumor
activity of these agents is not known. Furthermore, it
is also not known whether some human tumors depend
on both Aurora A and JAK2 for survival and malignant
transformation. Finally, whether Aurora A and JAk2
cooperate to induce malignant transformation and whether
dual targeting is more effective than single targeting are
also not known. In this manuscript, we used genetic and
pharmacological approaches and provided evidence for
the superiority of dual Aurora A and JAK2 targeting.
First, we demonstrated that Aurora A and JAK2 together
are more effective than each alone at inducing nontransformed cells to grow in a non-adherent manner and
invade. Since both anchorage-independent tumor growth
and invasion facilitate metastasis, our results suggest that
aberrantly-activated Aurora A and JAK2 pathways may
cooperate to promote tumor metastasis. The observation
that Aurora A increased anchorage-independent growth
and invasion is consistent with previous reports [37].
Furthermore, the JAK2-induced soft agar growth and
invasion may be mediated by activation of STAT3 that has
also been implicated in metastasis [38, 39]. Our results
demonstrating that the co-expression of Aurora A and
JAK2 is more effective than single expression at inducing
anchorage-independent growth and invasion prompted
us to evaluate the effectiveness of the dual inhibition
of these two kinases on malignant transformation. Both
approaches we used, combination silencing by siRNA as
well as combination treatment with Aurora A and JAK2
pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated the superior
activity of dual suppression. Indeed, in 3 out of the 8 cell
lines evaluated, depletion of both kinases was much more
effective than single depletion at inhibiting anchoragedependent growth. Furthermore, the finding that dual
silencing of both kinases was more effective at inducing
apoptosis and inhibiting anchorage-independent growth
and invasion suggested that some cancer cells depend on
both kinases for maintaining malignant transformation
and that treatment targeting both Aurora A and JAK2
pathways might be a more effective anti cancer therapy
approach. The clinical validation of this approach is
feasible since the inhibitors of these two kinases, Alisertib
and Ruxolitinib, that we have used to demonstrate the dual
inhibition benefit, are presently undergoing clinical trials
as single agents [40–42].
At present we do not know what makes some
tumors (i.e. MDA-MB-468, HT-29 and DU-145 ) but not
others (A549, MCF7, H460, MDA-MB-231 and HCT1116) more susceptible to Aurora/JAK2 dual targeting.
Differences in the expression levels of these two kinases
cannot account for this since we have seen no correlations
between the expression levels with sensitivity to dual
targeting (data not shown). Studies comparing differences
between a large number of susceptible and non-susceptible
human cancer cell lines with respect to gene expression

AJI-100 induces tumor regression in vivo
We next determined whether AJI-100 is able to
inhibit tumor growth in vivo in the nude mouse xenograft
model. AJI-214 was not soluble at the concentrations
needed for in vivo studies. For these studies, MDAMB-468 cells were implanted s.c. under the flank of nude
mice and when the tumors reached an average volume
of 250 mm3, the mice were randomized and injected i.p.
daily for 14 days with either vehicle or AJI-100 (50 mpk).
Figure 6C shows representative tumor growth curves. In
the vehicle-treated mouse the tumor grew from 211 to
357 mm3 over the 14 day treatment period, whereas the
tumor from the AJI-100-treated mouse regressed from 222
to 158 mm3 (Figure 6C). Figure 6D shows the average
% change in tumor volumes from all the mice treated.
On average tumors from the vehicle-treated mice grew
by 40 % whereas those from the AJI-100-treated mice
regressed by 9% (Figure 6D). The average % change
in tumor volumes from vehicle and the AJI-100 treated
groups were statistically different for measurements on
days 3 (p= 0.04), 5 (p=0.003), 7 (p=0.002), 10 (p=0.004),
12 (p=0.018) and 14 (p=0.025). Treatment with either
vehicle or AJI-100 had little effect on mouse weights,
which increased by 3.33 % and 0.04 %, respectively, over
the 14-day treatment period.

DISCUSSION
Aurora kinases play important roles in the
regulation of mitosis. Aurora A is required for spindle
assembly, whereas Aurora B is required for histone
H3 phosphorylation, chromosome segregation, and
cytokinesis [1, 2]. Aurora kinase inhibitors are of
considerable interest as potential anticancer agents because
of significant anti-tumor activity reported in preclinical
studies either as single agents or in combination with
other anti-cancer drugs [7, 14, 15, 32–34]. Furthermore,
the JAK/STAT pathway has also attracted interest as
a therapeutic target for human solid tumors as well as
hematological malignancies [24, 26, 35, 36]. Previous
reports have shown that multi kinase inhibitors such as
AT9283 and CEP–701 that block Aurora A and JAK2
among other kinases inhibit tumor growth potently (see
more below). However, the extent to which the dual

profiling, proteomic and phopho-proteomic are warranted
for indentifying the underlying mechanisms.
While combination treatment with 2 or more
selective agents is very useful for proof of concept
studies in preclinical settings, it has drawbacks and
presents serious challenges in human clinical trials. The
most critical are off-target toxicities associated with
each compound that necessitate separate early phase
clinical trials to assess single agent safety. Furthermore,
subsequent phase I trials with safe and tolerable doses
of each compound may result in unacceptable toxicities
of the combination. Thus, while a therapy based on a
combination of distinct Aurora A and JAK2 inhibitors is
feasible, there are obvious advantages to using a single
drug that inhibits both kinases. In this manuscript, we
report on the discovery of dual inhibitors that potently
inhibit Aurora A and B as well as JAK2 in vitro and in
intact human cancer cells, and that are highly effective
at inhibiting anchorage-dependent and –independent
growth and invasion and at inducing cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. Others have also reported recently on
inhibitors that target several kinases including JAK2 and
Aurora kinases. For example, AT9283 is a multi-targeted
kinase inhibitor with in vitro IC50 values for JAK2, JAK3,
Aurora A, Aurora B and Abl of 1.2, 1.0,1.0, 3.0, 3.0, and
4.0 nM, respectively [43]. AT9283 was shown to be
effective at suppressing the growth in nude mice of BCRABL positive human CML cells as well as increasing
survival of mice inoculated with cells from CML patients
[44]. AT9283 is currently in Phase I human clinical trials
[45]. Another example is that of the staurosporine analog
CEP-701 that inhibits several kinases including FLT3
(IC50 = 3 nM), Aurora A (IC50 = 2.7 nM), Aurora B
(IC50 = 6.9 nM) and JAK2 (IC50 = 1.2 nM) among others
[46]. A recent report showed that in colony forming assays,
JAK2- selective inhibitors inhibit the growth of erythroid
colonies, and Aurora-selective inhibitors inhibit myeloid
colony growth, whereas CEP-701 inhibited both [47].
Based on this observation, the authors suggested that CEP701 may accomplish this through inhibition of Aurora and
JAK2. CEP-701 is currently being investigated in clinical
trials in patients with primary or post-polycythemia vera/
essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis [48].
The dual action of our inhibitors was further
confirmed by demonstrating that the selective Aurora
inhibitors VX-680 and Alisertib and the selective JAK2
inhibitor Ruxolitinib impaired only their respective
targets pT288-Aurora A and pSer10-Histone H3 (Aurora
A and B) and pY705-STAT3 (JAK2) whereas AJI-214 and
AJI-100 inhibited both targets. Furthermore, AJI-214 and
VX-680 but not Ruxolitinib induced G2/M accumulation,
suggesting that this affect is due to the ability of AJI-214
to inhibit Aurora but not JAK2. The G2/M arrest seen
with AJI-214 is consistent with previous studies showing
that inhibition of Aurora kinases interferes with cell cycle
progression primarily through a G2/M arrest [49].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Taken together, our multi-pronged approach using
ectopic co-expression to demonstrate cooperation of
Aurora A and JAK2 to transform normal cells as well as
the genetic silencing and the pharmacological inhibition
of these kinases in human cancer cells, support the notion
that the combination treatment targeting both Aurora A
and JAK2 pathways might be more beneficial to some
cancer patients.

MATERIALS and METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), lung cancer cell lines (A549
and H460), and colon cancer cells (HCT-116 and HT-29)
were obtained from ATCC (the American Type Culture
Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) or RPMI
1640, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.
Alisertib (MLN8237) and INCB-18424 (Ruxolitinib)
were purchased from Selleck chemicals (Houston, TX).
Nocodazole and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). VX-680 (Tozasertib) was purchased from BioVision
incorporated (Milpitas, CA). AJI-214 and AJI-100 were
synthesized as described previously [30]. All drugs for cell
culture were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma).

Knockdown by siRNA transfection
Cancer cells were plated in six-well plates and next
day transiently transfected with 35 nM of SignalSilence
siRNA for Aurora A/AIK, JAK2 (Cell Signaling #8883
and #6235), or nonspecific control siRNA (Cell Signaling
#6568) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Invitrogen #13778), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Transfected cells were collected 72 h after
transfection and protein expression levels were monitored
by Western blot analysis.

Ectopic expression of Aurora A and JAK2 in
HPNE cells
HPNE cells were obtained from Drs Der and
Campbell (University of North Carolina), and were
originally isolated from the ductal structure of a normal
human pancreas and were immortalized with the catalytic
subunit of telomerase (h-Tert), as was described previously
[50]. HPNE cells were maintained in Medium D that
is comprised of one volume of M3 base (InCell Corp.,
San Antonio, TX, USA), three volumes of glucose-free
DMEM, and 5% FBS, 5.5mM glucose, 10ng/ml EGF, and
50μg/ml gentamycin, at 37°C in humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. HA-wt-Aurora A was created by
PCR using pcDNA3-Aurora A as template, as previously

from GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD). Transfections
were performed using 0.3 ugs of DNA constructs in
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

(D2E12) (Cell  Signaling, #3230), p-STAT3 (Y705)
(Cell Signaling, #9131) and STAT3 (F-2) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, SC-8019), p-Akt (Ser-473) and Akt2
(D6G4) (Cell Signaling, # 9271 and #3063), p-ERK
and ERK (Cell Signaling, #9101 and #9102), as well as
cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling,
#5625 and #9604), and PARP-1(F2) SC-8007 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) After wash, the membranes were
then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab)
at room temperature for 1 h and visualized with the ECL
system (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously [51].

Cell viability and proliferation assays
Cells were cultured in 96 well plates at a density
of 2,000 cells/ well. The cells with siRNA transfection or
with the inhibitor treatment were monitored for viability
using MTT at indicated time points. At the given time
points, MTT reagent was added to the media and allowed
to incubate for 3 h at 37° C in a humidified incubator
at 5% CO2. The medium was then removed and MTT
crystals were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma). Cell viability
was quantified by reading the plates at an absorbance of
540 nm on a μQuant microplate reader using KC4 data
analysis software (Bio-Tek Instruments). The 540 nm
absorbance of vehicle-treated wells was used to define
100% proliferation. Each condition was performed in
replicates of six wells.

Cell-cycle analysis and detection of apoptosis
To evaluate the effect of inhibitors on cell cycle
progression, cells were treated with inhibitors at
indicated dose or DMSO control and then harvested,
fixed with 70% ethanol pretreated with RNase,
and stained with propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) as
previously described for flow cytometry analysis [52].
For the detection of apoptosis, cells were cultured
for 24 h in medium with inhibitors at indicated dose
or DMSO control and harvested for SDS−PAGE and
Western blotting. The siRNA or drug treatment-induced
apoptosis was detected by Western blot analysis of the
cleavage of PARP and caspase-3.

Determination of inhibition of Aurora and JAK2
kinase activity
Cells were plated in 6 cm dishes at a density of
2 × 105 cells/dish. Aurora A activity was determined by
measuring autophosphorylation of Aurora A on Thr288 in
cells that were synchronized by treatment with nocodazole
(100 ng/mL) for 20 h prior to the treatment with Aurora
inhibitors, whereas Aurora B activity was determined by
measuring phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser-10 (pHH3). DMSO was used as a vehicle control, and Alisertib
(0.3 μM) or VX-680 (0.5 μM) was used as a positive
control for Aurora inhibition and Ruxolitinib as a positive
control for JAK inhibition. Cells were harvested after 2 h
of treatment and processed for SDS−PAGE and Western
blotting.

Soft agar assay
For analysis of anchorage-independent growth, logphase growing cells were trypsinized, and triplicates of 1.5
x 103 cells per well were seeded in regular growth medium
containing 0.3% agar (Sigma) and drug added at the
indicated concentrations, as previously described [53]. The
cells were allowed to incubate at 37° C for 3 weeks and
fed once per week with the inhibitor before 1 mg/ml MTT
(Sigma) solution was added overnight to facilitate colony
counting. Colonies were scored and counted according to
size, as previously described [53].

Western blotting
Cells were harvested from experiments of
ectopic expression or knockdown using siRNA or the
treatment with the inhibitors, washed, and then lysed
using lysis buffer as previously described [51]. The
protein concentration of the lysate was measured, and
the lysate was mixed with gel electrophoresis loading
buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, separated by SDS-PAGE,
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The
membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in
TBST containing 5% (w/v) milk before incubating them
overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: antiAurora A/AIK (1G4) (Cell Signaling, #4718), Aurora
B/AIM1 (Cell Signaling, #3094), p-Aurora A Thr 288
(Cell Signaling, #3079), p-histone H3 (Ser-10) and
histone H3 (Cell Signaling, # 9701 and #9715), JAK2

Cell Invasion
The invasion capability of the immortalized cells
HPNE transfected with either Aurora A or JAK2 or both of
them, as well as the tumor cell lines MDA-MB-468, and
HT29 treated with siRNA or compounds was measured
using Matrigel coated Transwell cell culture chambers
(8 μm pore size; Costar, Acton, MA) as described
previously [54]. Cells were transfected with Aurora A
and JAK2 for 48 h or with siRNA for 72 h or treated
with the compounds for 24 h and then were trypsinized
and resuspended in serum-free medium and placed in
the upper chamber of the Matrigel-coated (0.8 μg/μL,
BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) Transwell insert (from
2 to 5 x 104 cells/well) and with 0.5% DMSO or the

compounds at the indicated dose. Medium containing
10%FBS was placed in the lower chamber. Cells were
incubated for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere with
95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Invading cells in the
membrane were fixed with 100% methanol and stained
with fresh prepared 0.2% crystal violet. Noninvasive
cells in the upper chamber were removed by wiping the
upper side of the membrane with a cotton swab, and cells
located on the underside of the filter were observed and
photographed under Olympus stereo microscope. The
number of invading cells was counted using Image-Pro
analysis software.

Antitumor study of human tumor xenografts in
nude mice
Female nude mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) were maintained and treated in
accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee procedures and guidelines. Exponentially
growing MDA-MB-468 cells were harvested via
trypsinization, pelleted at 400 g for 5 min. Cell pellets
were re-suspended in DPBS (Invitrogen) at 10 x106 cells
per 200 µl, and injected into right flank of mice. The
tumor xenografts were monitored with an electronic
caliper measurements and tumor volume (V) was
calculated using the formula V= (W x L2)/2, where
width is the largest diameter and length is the smallest
diameter. When the tumors reached ~ 250 mm3, the
animals were randomized and treatment schedules were
implemented. Treatments consisted of intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injections of vehicle control (50% polyethylene
glycol (PG) + 15% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin
(HPCD) (n=5) or AJI-100 (n=6) at 50 mg/kg, everyday
