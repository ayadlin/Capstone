Abstract
ERBB2/neu and Notch signaling are known to be deregulated in many human cancers. However, pathway
cross-talk and dependencies are not well understood. In this study, we use an ERBB2-transgenic mouse model
of breast cancer (neuT) to show that Notch signaling plays a critical role in tumor maintenance. Inhibition of
the Notch pathway with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) decreased both the Notch and the mammalian target of
rapamycin/AKT pathways. Antitumor activity resulting from GSI treatment was associated with decreased cell
proliferation as measured by Ki67 and decreased expression of glucose transporter Glut1. Positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging showed that the functional consequences of decreased Glut1 translated to reduced
glucose uptake and correlated with antitumor effects as measured by micro-computed tomography imaging.
The decrease of Glut1 in neuT tumors was also observed in several human breast cancer cell lines following
GSI treatment. We provide evidence that ∼27% of ERBB2-positive human breast cancer specimens display
high expression of HES1, phospho-S6RP, and GLUT1. Together, these results suggest that pathways downstream of Notch signaling are, at least in part, responsible for promoting tumor growth in neuT and also active
in both neuT and a subset of human breast cancers. These findings suggest that GSI may provide therapeutic
benefit to a subset of ERBB2-positive breast cancers and that [18F]FDG-PET imaging may be useful in monitoring clinical response. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2476–84. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The Notch pathway is a conserved cell signaling pathway
involved in differentiation, cell fate, and tissue homeostasis
(1). Activation through binding with cell-surface ligand families Delta and Jagged produces a series of cleavages in the
Notch receptor (2, 3). The final cleavage by the protease complex γ-secretase releases the Notch intracellular domain
(NICD), which then translocates to the nucleus (4). NICD

forms a complex with the transcriptional repressor CSL (5),
which is subsequently transformed from repressor to activator, transcribing a number of downstream target genes, including members of the HES and HEY families as well as
many others (1, 6).
Notch signaling is deregulated in a variety of cancers including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), non–small
cell lung cancer, and breast cancer. In T-ALL, Notch signaling
is activated through NOTCH1 receptor mutations found in
>50% of patients (7) with translocations found in ∼1% of cases
(reviewed in ref. 8). NOTCH3 activation has been observed in
lung cancer cell lines and human tumors in which γ-secretase
inhibitor (GSI) has been shown to have antitumor effects (9).
Coexpression of NOTCH1 and its ligand JAG1 in breast cancer
correlates with poor survival (10), and Notch pathway activation is seen in patients through decreased expression of
Numb (11), a negative regulator of Notch signaling (12). Notch
signaling events can be blocked by intervening at various sites,
including inhibition of the final cleavage by γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI), which prevent the formation of NICD and are
currently being evaluated in cancer patients.
Recent data indicate that GSI is effective in inhibiting proliferation and in induction of apoptosis. GSI effects are much
higher in ERBB2-positive cell lines where ERBB2 is amplified

Application of Functional Imaging for GSI Activity

Figure 1. Inhibition of tumor growth by GSI in neuT mice. A, neuT mice with one but not more than two palpable tumors were enrolled (n = 8 per group) and
treated with either GSI (300 mg/kg) or vehicle once a week for 3 wk. The number (mean ± SEM) of visible tumors was manually counted twice a week.
B, a separate cohort of mice (n = 10 per group) was treated with either GSI (300 mg/kg) or vehicle once a week for 21 d. Volumetric changes in two tumors
were followed by microCT imaging and fold change was determined. C, mice were treated with GSI at 300 mg/kg or with vehicle once a week for
3 wk. Tumor burden was monitored for additional 70 d after treatment. Mice were removed from study when tumor volume reached 10% of body weight and
Kaplan-Meier survival curve was calculated.

and/or overexpressed (ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-453) compared
with ERBB2-negative cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) that
lack ERBB2 amplification and where ERBB2 expression is
low (13–15). A detailed mechanism of GSI effects and an evaluation of pharmacodynamic markers have not been explored
in breast cancer xenografts. In addition, no studies have been
reported in transgenic models of breast cancer where tumor
development and microenvironment more closely reflect the
human disease.
One transgenic mouse model is the ERBB2-driven mammary carcinogenesis model (neuT; ref. 16). Amplification or
overexpression of the ERBB2 oncogene, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, is amplified in more than one
fourth of human breast cancers and is associated with poor
prognosis (17). A variety of pathways or transcription factors
(18) may contribute to tumor development and maintenance
in ERBB2/neu–driven cancers, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) axis (reviewed in ref. 19). ERBB2 overexpression is
known to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in human
breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors (20). The AKT/
mTOR pathway is activated in neuT tumors, which are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors (21), as inactivation of Pten accelerates the formation of primary and metastatic breast tumor
in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-ERBB2 transgenic
mice (22).
ERBB2 has been shown to influence Notch signaling, yet
details of this response remain unclear. ERBB2 was reported
to activate NOTCH1 in breast cancer cells (23), although inactivation of ERBB2 signaling with trastuzumab led to Notch
pathway activation (24). Similar to ERBB2, Notch signaling is
known to impinge on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. The role of
the Notch pathway in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling was discovered in anoikis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in
human papilloma virus–derived cancers (24). Ectopic expres-

sion of NICD increased AKT activation in Jurkat cells (25),
and Notch signaling via PDK1 in pre-T cells promoted thymocyte growth as well as an mTOR-dependent proliferation
of T-cell progenitors (26). Notch also induced activation of
AKT in the breast cancer cell line MCF10A, and inhibition
of Notch decreased AKT signaling (27). NOTCH1 activated
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by direct repression of PTEN
via the Notch target gene HES1 (28). GSI inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling resulted in decreased cell size
in T-ALL cell lines (29), and PTEN mutation induced resistance to GSI (28). These studies indicate that Notch is an important regulator of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling network.
Because ERBB2 is known to influence Notch and function
partially through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, we sought to
determine if Notch signaling was active in the neuT model
and how GSI would affect AKT signaling, tumor growth,
and initiation. Here we report that Notch signaling is active
in the neuT model and impinges on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
axis. GSI inhibits tumor growth and increases survival of
neuT mice but has little effect on tumor initiation. Our data
also suggest that the effects of GSI on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway can be measured by noninvasive imaging such as
positron emission tomography (PET) and may be useful for
studying GSI response in a subset of ERBB2-positive breast
cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
In vivo experiments. BALB/c-neuT-transgenic female
mice were used in these studies (30). Mice with one or two
palpable tumors were enrolled in the efficacy experiments.
Mice received either 0.5% methylcellulose (vehicle) or GSI
(MRK-003) at specified concentrations administered p.o. at
different dosing schedules including daily, 3 d on/4 d off,
or 1 d on/10 d off. Efficacy was measured by tumor number

(initiation of palpable tumors) and/or tumor volume (by caliper), which were monitored twice a week throughout the
study. Body weights and other clinical signs were assessed
twice per week to determine tolerability. Mice were euthanized 6 h after the final dose. Tumors were weighed and
analyzed by biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. Blood was collected to determine GSI concentration.
All procedures were done according to protocols approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Merck Research Laboratories.
In vitro experiment. Cells procured from the American
Type Culture Collection were grown in complete medium
in a 37°C incubator and treated with either DMSO or GSI
at 1 μmol/L. Six hours after the GSI treatment, cells were harvested and protein lysate was prepared as described (31).
Immunohistochemical analysis. Formalin-fixed paraffinembedded mouse breast cancer tissues or tissue microarrays
(TMA) from human tumors were sectioned at 5-μm thickness and analyzed for Ki67 (1:200, clone SP6, Neomarkers),
phospho-S6RP (1:75; Cell Signaling Technology), Glut1
(1:250; Abcam), ERBB2 (Ventana), and Hes1 (1:200; MBL).
Automated staining was done using the ChromoMap Kit on

the Discovery XT (Ventana Medical Systems) under standard
conditions. TMA sections of each tumor were stained with antibody against ERBB2, HES-1, GLUT1, or pS6RP. Three consecutive TMA sections were stained with each antibody at the
same time. A sample scored positive if more than 50% of
the tumor retained stain in two of three consecutive sections.
The intensity of staining was scored manually (high, 3;
medium, 2; low, 1; no staining, 0) by two independent investigators (Supplementary Table S2).
Immunoblot analysis. Tumors were collected and protein
lysates were made as described (32). Briefly, 30 μg of lysate
were immunoblotted with antibodies (1:500 dilution) against
S6RP, phospho-S6RP, ERBB2, phospho-ERBB2, Glut1, Pten,
Akt, and phospho-Akt (S473) (Cell Signaling Technology).
β-Actin or tubulin (Abcam) was used as loading control.
MicroPET/micro-computed tomography imaging study.
neuT mice were enrolled (n = 10 per group) into the imaging
study when the total tumor volume of each mouse was between 150 and 300 mm3 as determined by micro-computed
tomography (microCT) image analysis. Baseline 2-[ 18 F]
fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), microPET, and microCT
imaging scans were done before initiation of therapy and then
weekly for 3 wk. After enrollment, mice were gavaged either
with vehicle or with GSI at 300 mg/kg once a week. [18F]
FDG was synthesized using standard methods (33), and 100
μCi were injected i.v. under isoflurane anesthesia. Sixty minutes after the radiotracer injection, mice were given 2 mL of a
1:9 dilution of a microCT contrast agent (Omnipaque-300, GE
Healthcare). The contrast agent aided in the identification and
segmentation of individual tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2).
MicroPET images were collected using a Concorde Focus
220 microPET (Siemens Medical Solutions) using the 5-min
static acquisition protocol. Immediately following microPET
image acquisition, microCT images were acquired on a GE
eXplore Locus Ultra microCT system (GE Healthcare) using
the 16-s anatomic protocol. After completion of microPET
and microCT image acquisition, the image data were reconstructed to give the respective image data.
Two tumors per mouse that could be identified longitudinally in all four scans by both microPET and microCT were
selected for analysis. For microPET image analysis, tumor regions of interest were manually drawn using ASPIRO (Concorde Microsystems) and uptake of [18F]FDG was reported in
normalized activity units. Tumor volumes were determined
from microCT images using the Amira 4.1.1 software (Mercury Computer Systems, Inc.). Fold increases of tumor volumes
from baseline scans were calculated.
Data analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test was conducted to evaluate the effect of
GSI on tumor (number and volume) and body weight. Student's
t test was applied for the difference between control and treated
for Ki67, tumor weight, pharmacokinetic, and survival analysis.

Figure 2. Tumor initiation was unaffected by GSI in neuT mice.
Four-week-old neuT mice (n = 12 per group) were treated with either
vehicle or GSI (150 and 300 mg/kg) once a week for 16 wk. A, body
weight was measured twice a week. B, the appearance of the first
palpable tumor was monitored and percent of tumor-free mice was
plotted.

Figure 3. GSI inhibits the Notch
pathway and proliferation in neuT
tumor. A, neuT tumor–bearing
mice were treated with a single
dose of GSI at 150 mg/kg.
Plasma concentration of GSI was
determined at the indicated times.
B, neuT tumor–bearing mice were
treated with vehicle or GSI (150
and 300 mg/kg) once weekly for
5 wk. Mice were euthanized 6 h
after the last dose and plasma
concentration of GSI was
determined. C, tumors were
dissected 6 h after the last dose
from neuT mice treated with either
vehicle or GSI (50, 100, and 150

genes (c-Myc, Hes1, DTX1, Hey1,
Hes7, Hey2, and HeyL) were
determined by quantitative PCR.

than two palpable tumors were identified for enrollment.
Following enrollment, neuT mice were given either vehicle
or GSI under several different dosing regimens. Body weight
and the number of palpated tumors were determined twice
per week for 3 weeks. Tumor growth inhibition required an
intermittent dosing schedule, as we showed previously in
T-ALL models (31, 34; Supplementary Fig. S1). Antitumor
activity was achieved using 150 mg/kg 3 days a week, a single dose of 300 mg/kg p.o. once a week, or a dose of 300 to
500 mg/kg every 10 days (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S1A, C, and D). Other doses tested were either not
tolerated or not efficacious (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 2A,
and data not shown).
In addition to the significant effect on tumor number, antitumor effects were also observed when tumor volume was
quantified using caliper or microCT imaging (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A). The volumetric data correlated with tumor weight, reduced 27% and 52%, respectively, in mice
treated with 300 and 500 mg/kg GSI once every 10 days compared with vehicle (Supplementary Fig. S1D). To determine if
antitumor effects translated to increased survival, tumorbearing mice were treated for 3 weeks and monitored biweekly thereafter without treatment. When tumor volume
reached 10% of the body weight, the mouse was removed
from study. The survival analysis suggests that the GSI antitumor effects translate into a survival benefit when com-

pared with the vehicle (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that
GSI may provide clinical benefit by decreasing the tumor
burden and increasing the survival of ERBB2-driven breast
cancers.
The Notch signaling pathway may be an important regulator of tumor-initiating cells or breast cancer stem cells (35).
To determine if Notch might play a role in onset of tumor
formation in this neuT model, we enrolled 30 neuT mice at
the age of 4 weeks where no microscopic tumor was evident
(data not shown). Mice were divided into three groups and
treated either with vehicle or with 150 or 300 mg/kg GSI
weekly for 18 weeks. GSI did not delay the appearance of
the first palpable tumor when treated at doses known to provide antitumor effects and inhibit Notch signaling in these
tumors (Fig. 2B and data not shown). These results suggest
that Notch signaling affects the maintenance of established
tumors (microscopic and macroscopic), yet provides little
support in tumor initiation in this model. Because the detection of tumor initiating cells is a rapidly advancing field,
more detailed studies are warranted.
Antitumor effects observed at doses where inhibition of
notch signaling is achieved in neuT tumors. Following confirmation of the GSI antitumor effects, we wanted to determine the correlation between response and Notch pathway
inhibition in this model. We began by determining the plasma
concentration of GSI-treated animals. Plasma levels peaked

∼5 hours after a single 150 mg/kg p.o. administration of GSI
and returned toward baseline levels by 48 hours (Fig. 3A and
data not shown). Similar levels and dose-dependent response
were observed in mice treated with GSI over the course of 5
weeks (150 mg/kg 3 days on 4 days off and 300 mg/kg once
weekly; Fig. 3B). Pharmacodynamic response was evaluated
by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry after 3 weeks
of treatment. In tumors, quantitative PCR provided evidence
that the plasma levels achieved were capable of modulating
Notch target genes (c-Myc, Hes1, Dtx1, Hey1, Hes7, Hey2, and
Hey). A 10-fold decrease in Dtx1, Hes7, HeyL, and Myc was associated with doses that provided antitumor effects, whereas
noneffective doses provided a <10-fold decrease in these target
genes (Fig. 3C). Although less dramatic effects were observed
in Hes1 mRNA levels relative to other target genes monitored,
effective doses decreased Hes1 protein levels as measured by
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3D). These events corresponded
with a decrease in Ki67 (Fig. 3D, bottom), indicating that GSIinduced inhibition of Notch signaling results in decreased proliferation and antitumor activity in the neuT model.
Inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling and decreased Glut1
are achieved by GSI in neuT tumors. ERBB2 and Notch signaling are known to impinge on the PI3K/AKT pathway. We

evaluated the status and response of three PI3K pathway
markers (phospho-Akt, phospho-S6RP, and Pten) by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry in neuT tumors treated
with GSI. Phospho-AKT and phospho-S6RP show that the
AKT pathway is activated in these tumors relative to normal
mammary glands (Fig. 4A). AKT/mTOR pathway activation is
also associated with Glut family members in many solid tumors, and we therefore wanted to determine whether Glut
proteins are expressed in neuT tumors. Our data suggest that
Glut1 is overexpressed in the epithelial cells of neuT tumors
(Fig. 4B). Based on these findings, we initiated studies to observe whether Notch inhibition has any effect on PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway activity and Glut1 expression in this model.
GSI decreased phospho-Akt as measured by both immunoblot and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4C and data not
shown). To understand the cause of decreased level of phospho-Akt, we have analyzed the level of total Pten protein. Data show that GSI has no effect on the total protein level of
Pten in neuT tumors (Fig. 4C). The effects of GSI on ERBB2
were evaluated by the levels of total and phospho-ERBB2 in
neuT tumors treated with either GSI or vehicle. Both total
and phospho-ERBB2 remained unchanged after GSI treatment, whereas a decreased level of phospho-ERBB2 was

observed in tumors treated with lapatinib (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Similarly, data indicate a downregulation of
phospho-S6RP by treatment with GSI in neuT mice (Fig.
4D, top). Together, these results show that the PI3K pathway is activated in these tumors and was downregulated
by GSI. To determine the relationship between inhibition
of the AKT/mTOR pathway by GSI and the Glut1 levels,
we performed immunohistochemistry analysis of Glut1. Data showed a significant decrease of Glut1 by GSI (Fig. 4D,
bottom).
GSI inhibits glucose uptake in neuT tumors. Following
observation of GSI-mediated downregulation of Glut1 in
neuT tumors, we wanted to determine whether these tumors display increased glucose uptake as compared with
the surrounding normal tissues and modulation by GSI.
We administered [ 18F]FDG and analyzed the uptake of
the radiotracer in vivo by microPET imaging. Baseline
images showed measurable levels of [18F]FDG uptake in
neuT tumors as compared with other tissues (Fig. 5A).
The radiotracer was also observed in mouse tissues (heart
and brown fat) known to express high levels of Glut1 as
well as in the urinary bladder because the radiotracer is
cleared via the kidneys. To determine if GSI affects glucose
uptake and whether [18F]FDG-PET imaging could serve as a
functional readout, we conducted microPET imaging analysis on neuT mice for 3 weeks with an efficacious regimen of
300 mg/kg GSI once per week (Fig. 1). GSI treatment decreased [18F]FDG uptake at all treatment points measured
starting from day 7 to day 21 (Fig. 5A and B). These data
show the active uptake of glucose by neuT tumors and
that GSI can decrease the [18F]FDG radiotracer uptake as
monitored by noninvasive microPET imaging.
Overexpression of GLUT1 in ERBB2-positive human primary breast cancer and downregulation of GLUT1 by GSI
in human breast cancer cells. Our data show a role for γsecretase in tumor growth progression and the connection of
the Notch and PI3K pathways. Next, we wanted to determine
whether these results were restricted to mouse tumors or
were reflected in human breast cancer. We treated ERBB2positive (MDA-MB-453) human breast cancer cells with GSI

www.aacrjournals.org

and observed that HES1 and GLUT1 protein expression was
downregulated when cells were treated with 1 μmol/L GSI as
compared with DMSO (Fig. 6A). No difference in ERBB2 expression was observed in these cells, indicating that the GSI
effects are downstream of ERBB2 and not a direct effect on
the receptor (Fig. 6A). Next, we wanted to determine the levels of ERBB2, HES1, pS6RP, and GLUT1 in human breast
cancer. Seventy-six human breast tumor sections from primary (n = 29) and metastatic (n = 47) patients were stained
with antibodies against ERBB2, HES1, pS6RP, or GLUT1 (Fig.
6B). We observed that 51% (39 of 76) of the tumors are
ERBB2 positive, 58% (44 of 76) are HES1 positive, 75% (57
of 76) are pS6RP positive, and 71% (54 of 76) are GLUT1 positive (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Table S1). No signal from phospho-Akt (S473 and T308) was observed and may be a result of
phospho-epitope stability. We observed a correlation of
ERBB2 protein level with pS6RP, GLUT1, and HES1 proteins
in a subset (27%) of human breast tumor specimens. The
high level of ERBB2 protein may be due to the amplification
and/or overexpression of ERBB2 in these tumors. We assessed tumor grade by pathologic scoring and no correlation
between tumor grade and increased staining of these markers was observed (Supplementary Table S2). However, a
trend toward positive staining of these markers was observed
in metastatic tumors (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Expression of all four proteins was observed in 27% (21 of 76) of
the tumors, showing that this pathway (ERBB2, Notch,
and AKT/mTOR) is active in approximately one quarter of
human breast cancers. Together, these data suggest that
GSIs may provide therapeutic benefit to this population of
breast cancer patients and their response may be monitored
by noninvasive functional imaging techniques.

Discussion
The neuT transgenic mouse is important for understanding ERBB2-driven breast cancers because it aptly mimics
some form of human disease. It provides advantages over human breast cancer xenograft models by its nature as a primary autochthonous tumor and development in the presence of

an intact immune system. However, like other models, it has
limitations, one being the overexpression of ERBB2 driven by
MMTV promoter (not by amplification), which begins at puberty. These factors may influence complex developmental
signaling pathways such as Notch. Here we describe the effect of Notch pathway modulation in the neuT breast cancer
model using a γ-secretase inhibitor.
We observed an active Notch signaling pathway as
evidenced by the ability of GSI to induce a dose-dependent
decrease in the expression of several Notch target genes, including Hes1 and Myc. The Notch target genes Hes1 and Myc
are important regulators of the GSI antitumor effect. Alteration of MYC is associated with a very short-term prognosis
in human breast cancer (36, 37). Myc has been shown to induce breast tumor formation in MMTV mouse models, and
turning off MYC expression resulted in tumor regression (38,
39). In Notch-dependent T-ALL cells, overexpression of MYC
can block the effect of GSI (32). In neuT tumors, downregulation of Myc associated with antitumor activity on administration of GSI suggests that Notch is driving Myc and may be
partly responsible for the antitumor effects.

Our results also support a role of AKT signaling in the GSIdependent response of neuT tumors because a decrease in
phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP was observed. The Notch
target gene HES1 has been shown to regulate cell growth
by two mechanisms, by repressing the cell cycle regulator
p27kip1 (40) and through direct regulation of the AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway by repressing PTEN expression (28).
Therefore, regulation of this pathway in neuT tumor may
be due to the regulation of PTEN activity by HES1. Here
we show that inhibition of Notch signaling in neuT mammary tumors is associated with decreased cell proliferation as
measured by Ki67.
The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is known to influence
cell growth through anabolic processes that control glucose
metabolism, ATP production, and glucose uptake through
HIF1 transcriptional control of the glucose transporter
GLUT1 (41, 42). Elevated levels of GLUT1 provide increased
uptake of the substrate [18F]FDG, which serves as a clinically
relevant PET imaging agent for measuring the response of
metabolically active tumors. Increased Glut1 expression
and increased [18F]FDG uptake in neuT breast tumors reflect

Application of Functional Imaging for GSI Activity

their elevated metabolic activity relative to normal breast tissue that can be modulated by GSI. Although many factors
may contribute to the GSI antitumor effects, we introduce
data showing that a reduction of Glut1 may also be a contributing factor. Changes in tumor volume as measured by caliper, microCT, and tumor weight were similar to the effects
observed by [18F]FDG-PET and suggest that this latter measure may provide an early readout of clinical response. These
data suggest that [18F]FDG-PET may be useful in monitoring
GSI response in other ERBB2-positive cancers, including
non–small-cell lung, pancreatic, endometrial, bladder, and
gastric cancers.
We also evaluated the effects of GSI on tumor initiation
using the neuT model by treating mice at 4 weeks of age, before the appearance of microscopic tumor. Results show that,
under these parameters, GSI was ineffective in preventing the
occurrence of palpable tumors. These functional data and
the fact that GSI had no effect on ERBB2 levels in the human
cell lines tested suggest that the transgene in the neuT model
was not directly affected by MRK-003. Because GSI does not
affect ERBB2, a combination of GSI with ERBB2 inhibitors
may prove beneficial and is further supported by observations that ERBB2 can influence the activity of Notch (43)
and inhibition of ERBB2 via trastuzumab can activate Notch
signaling (23). This information will be important in considering GSI as a monotherapy or in combination with trastuzumab or lapatinib in metastatic breast cancers, which stain
for the four markers (ERBB2, HES1, pS6RP, and GLUT1).
Due to its complex nature, it is important to understand
how gain- or loss-of-function events influence GSI response
in other cancer types. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway by mutations of PIK3CA, PTEN, LKB1, and TSC2
or by amplification of PIK3CA, AKT1, AKT2, p70S6K, and
IKBKE is common in a majority of solid tumors, including
breast (44), and PIK3CA mutation is more common in hormone receptor–positive and ERBB2-positive breast cancers
(45). Likewise, FBW7 mutations have also been shown to

increase Notch signaling; however, they also lead to diminished Notch-dependent regulation of MYC, conferring GSI
resistance to cells harboring both NOTCH1 and FBW7 mutations (46). It will be important to understand how these
events influence Notch signaling if clinical benefits from
GSI treatment are to be fully realized.
GSIs provide antitumor effects through several mechanisms, including direct effects on Notch-dependent tumor
cells as shown here, in addition to indirect effects via tumor
angiogenesis (47), immune modulation (48), and tumor-initiating cells (49). In addition, γ-secretase processes a number
of substrates (50) besides Notch; therefore, the antitumor effects of GSI shown here may also be influenced by these
events. In summary, we show that the Notch/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway is active in the neuT model as well as in
human breast cancer (Supplementary Fig. S3). Inhibition of
Notch signaling in ERBB2-positive preclinical models results
in modulation of the Notch/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
and attenuates glucose uptake associated with antitumor
effect. These data support the use of GSI for treatment
of ERBB2/NOTCH/pS6RP/GLUT1–positive breast cancer patients whose response may be monitored by noninvasive
[18F]FDG-PET imaging.
