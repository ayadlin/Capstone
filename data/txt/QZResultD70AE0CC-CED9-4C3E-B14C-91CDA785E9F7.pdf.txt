Abstract
Hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (H-MM) is the most common
form of myeloma. In this gene expression profiling study, we
show that H-MM is defined by a protein biosynthesis signature
that is primarily driven by a gene dosage mechanism as a
result of trisomic chromosomes. Within H-MM, four independently validated patient clusters overexpressing nonoverlapping sets of genes that form cognate pathways/networks that
have potential biological importance in multiple myeloma
were identified. One prominent cluster, cluster 1, is characterized by high expression of cancer testis antigen and
proliferation-associated genes. Tumors from these patients
were more proliferative than tumors in other clusters (median
plasma cell labeling index, 3.8; P < 0.05). Another cluster,
cluster 3, is characterized by genes involved in tumor necrosis
factor/nuclear factor-KB signaling and antiapoptosis. These
patients have better response to bortezomib as compared
with patients within other clusters (70% versus 29%; P = 0.02).
Furthermore, for a group of patients generally thought to
have better prognosis, a cluster of patients with short survival
(cluster 1; median survival, 27 months) could be identified.
This analysis illustrates the heterogeneity within H-MM and
the importance of defining specific cytogenetic prognostic
factors. Furthermore, the signatures that defined these
clusters may provide a basis for tailoring treatment to
individual patients. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):2982–9]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell malignancy
characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity that has been
gradually unraveled in recent years. It is now recognized that there
are two broad genetic subtypes of multiple myeloma as defined by
chromosome number: hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (H-MM, 48–
74 chromosomes), which is characterized by trisomies of
chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21 and a lower prevalence
of primary translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy
chain (IgH) locus at 14q32, and nonhyperdiploid multiple myeloma
(NH-MM; <48 or >75 chromosomes), which is associated with the

presence of primary IgH translocations such as t(4;14), t(11;14), and
t(14;16) (refs. 1, 2). The current model of molecular pathogenesis of
multiple myeloma proposes a dichotomous pathway for the two
main genetic subtypes of multiple myeloma because characteristic
changes are already observed at the premalignant monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance stage (3).
H-MM constitutes f50% to 60% of multiple myeloma (1, 4), yet
little of its biology is known. Overall survival is favorable for
patients with H-MM, but some H-MM patients clearly have a more
aggressive variant of the disease (5, 6). In view of this, we
hypothesize that H-MM is likely to be biologically heterogeneous,
and understanding this heterogeneity may provide a better
understanding of the underlying biology, identify possible molecular therapeutic targets, and allow better risk stratification of
patients.
In this study, we use gene expression profiling (GEP) to
characterize the molecular profile of H-MM, with a view of gaining
some insights about its biology, and to study the heterogeneity
within H-MM.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Mayo Clinic (group 1). Fifty-three H-MM and 37 NH-MM with
adequately good quality RNA for gene expression study were included. Of
the NH-MM patients, 29 were newly diagnosed and 8 had relapsed disease.
Among the 53 H-MM patients, 37 were newly diagnosed and 16 had
relapsed multiple myeloma. Bone marrow aspirate samples were obtained
after informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and
enriched for CD138+ cells (plasma cells) using immunomagnetic bead
separation (AutoMACS, Miltenyi-Biotec, Auburn, CA). In addition, IgH
translocations and chromosome 13 deletion (D13) were assessed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with concurrent immunofluorescent staining for clonotypic cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (7) using probes
previously described (8). Plasma cell labeling index (PCLI) was assessed
using a slide-based method as previously described (9). Where data were
available, patients were also staged according to the International Staging
System (10). A summary of clinical information of H-MM patients is
presented in Supplementary Table S1. Survival data were available from 50
of the H-MM patients (37 newly diagnosed and 13 relapsed). Twenty-seven
of the 50 patients have died. The median and minimum durations of followup from time of sampling for the surviving patients are 30 and 13 months,
respectively. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board.
Patients entered into bortezomib trials (group 2). For validation of
subtype signatures detected in group 1 patients, we used a cohort of 86
H-MM entered into bortezomib trials (11). For the assessment of response
and progression-free survival to bortezomib, we analyzed a subset of 63 HMM patients entered into the international phase 3 clinical trial (APEX) of

bortezomib versus dexamethasone. In total, 29 patients received singleagent bortezomib whereas the other 34 patients were randomized to
dexamethasone. These patients all had relapsed disease. The European
Blood and Marrow Transplant group criteria were used to defined response
and progression in these patients (12). In this analysis, we considered
patients with minimal response or better as having a response. For
response analysis, only patients treated with bortezomib were included.
University of Arkansas patients (group 3). As an additional validation
cohort, 91 newly diagnosed patients with H-MM from the University of
Arkansas with publicly available gene expression data were assessed (13).

Assignment of Hyperdiploid Cases
For group 1 patients, hyperdiploidy was determined by a FISH-based
trisomy index that is highly specific for H-MM (14). For group 2 and 3
patients, the H-MM subset is identified using the TC (Translocation and
Cyclin D) classification (13) based on the expression of only seven genes
(FGFR3, MMSET, ITGB7, MAF, CCND3, CCND1, and CCND2). Only those
patients assigned the D1 TC group (aberrant low level of CCND1
expression) that has been shown to unambiguously correspond to H-MM
(13, 15) were selected for further analysis. (For details, refer to
Supplementary methods).

Gene Expression Profiling
RNA isolation, purification, and microarray hybridization have previously
been reported for group 1 (16), group 2 (Mulligan et al. Blood, in press), and
group 3 (13). Gene expression analysis was done on CD138+ selected
(groups 1 and 3) and negative-selection enriched (group 2) plasma cell RNA
using the Affymetrix U133A (group 1), the U133A and B (group 2), and
U95Av2 chips (group 3; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). For the Mayo cohort,
gene expression intensity values were generated using the Affymetrix MAS
5.0 software. For normalization, the data were scaled by global methods to
a target value of 500, log transformed, median centered, and analyzed using
GeneSpring 7 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The gene expression
data are deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus6 (accession no. GSE
6477).

Gene Expression Analysis
To define the molecular signature of H-MM, we did a Student’s t test
with Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing corrections between
hyperdiploid and nonhyperdiploid cases in group 1. Differentially expressed
genes with adjusted P < 0.01 were selected for further Gene Ontology
analysis using the Gene Ontology mining tool available in GeneSpring and
pathway/network analysis using a web-based software tool, MetaCore
(GeneGo, Inc., St Joseph, MI). MetaCore contains an interactive, manually
annotated database derived from literature publications on proteins and
small molecules that allows for representation of biological functionality
and integration of functional, molecular, or clinical information. Several
algorithms to enable both the construction and analysis of gene networks
are integrated as previously described (17). The output P values reflect
scoring, prioritization, and statistical significance of networks according to
relevance of input data.
To investigate possible molecular heterogeneity within H-MM, we did a
recursive analysis using a combination of supervised and unsupervised
methods that allows identification of patient clusters defined by
nonoverlapping genes. Genes that varied across the individual H-MM
samples were first identified by Welch ANOVA using variance computed by
applying the Cross-Gene Error Model based on Deviation from 1 available
within GeneSpring. This method overcomes the lack of replicates and
variance associated with the individual samples and is similar in principle
to variance filtering. The filtered gene list (see Supplementary Table S2 for
gene list used for each recursive iteration) was then used to cluster group 1
H-MM samples using the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm (18).
Pearson’s correlation coefficient and centroid linkage were used as
similarity and linkage methods, respectively. The most highly correlated

gene cluster (at a distance of 0.7) that characterized the most tightly
clustered patients (at a distance of 0.7) was selected and used to recluster
the patients. Patients with 2-fold higher (than median) expression of 50% of
genes within the selected gene cluster were then assigned to a cluster.
These patients were removed from the overall cohort and the analysis
repeated on the remaining patients until no obvious large clusters could be
identified (Fig. 1). Subsequently, genes that distinguished these clusters,
requiring that the distinguishing genes have 2-fold higher expression than
in patients not in the cluster, and significantly different expression by t test
with Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing corrections, were generated.
For validation, the same probe sets that distinguished these clusters were
used to cluster group 2 samples. For group 3 samples, the best match probe
sets on the Affymetrix U95Av2 chip compared with U133A chip were
identified using Affymetrix mapping information7 and used for clustering.
To examine the biology of the differentially expressed genes, we did gene
set enrichment analysis, which has been described elsewhere (19). Briefly,
the method requires two inputs: (a) a list of genes (L) ranked based on the
correlation between their expression and the class distinction by using a
suitable metric and (b) a priori defined gene sets (S; e.g., pathways or
promoter motif sequences extracted from published experimental data or
curated databases). The goal of gene set enrichment analysis is to
determine whether the members of S are randomly distributed throughout
L or primarily found at the top or bottom, in which case the gene set is
correlated with the phenotypic class distinction (in our case, the different
H-MM clusters). The ranking metric used was Signal2Noise, and the

phenotype was permutated with 1,000 permutations to estimate the
statistical significance of enrichment. False discovery rate was controlled at
5% (see Supplementary methods for details of statistics).

Statistical Analysis
Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of
continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared using the m2
test. The distribution for overall survival was estimated using the method of
Kaplan and Meier. The log-rank test was used to test for differences in
survival between groups. Overall survival was calculated from diagnosis to
death for group 1 patients. For group 2 patients, progression-free survival
(PFS) was calculated from day of commencing bortezomib until disease
progression. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
H-MM is characterized by overexpression of genes involved
in protein biosynthesis. Five hundred and twenty-two probesets
representing 413 genes were differentially expressed between HMM and NH-MM in group 1 patients. On Gene Ontology analysis,
the Gene Ontology categories most associated with these differentially expressed genes were protein biosynthesis and metabolism
and ribosomal proteins (Table 1). Seventy-five of the 300 (25%)
genes with known function were involved in protein biosynthesis,
protein degradation, or protein transport. Twenty-eight of these
genes are in the top 100 most differentially expressed genes
between H-MM and NH-MM. Fifty-five genes were involved in
ribosome/protein biosynthesis, the majority of which were overexpressed in H-MM. Of the seven genes in this category that were
underexpressed relative to NH-MM, EIF4EBP2 is a negative
regulator of protein biosynthesis. Thirteen and seven genes were
involved in protein degradation and protein transport, respectively.
Most of these genes were underexpressed in H-MM (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Overall, these data seem to indicate that HMM, compared with NH-MM, is characterized by increased protein
synthesis with defective protein catabolism and transport. Indeed,
when the 522 gene probes were analyzed by MetaCore, the most
significant and relevant processes/networks were involved in
protein biosynthesis. Of interest, several of these networks
contained elements important in myeloma biology [nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB), c-myc, and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)], raising the possibility that one consequence of this
protein biosynthesis profile in H-MM is deregulation and
overproduction of oncogenic proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Proliferation of H-MM was not statistically different from NHMM [median PCLI, 0.6 (range, 0–9.4) versus 0.5 (range, 0–6.2);
P = 0.34], suggesting that the up-regulation of protein biosynthesis
genes in H-MM was unlikely to be proliferation related.
Of the 48 overexpressed genes involved in protein biosynthesis,
only 6 were not located on the common trisomic chromosomes
(chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21), suggesting that
chromosomal copy number amplification is the most common
mechanism for up-regulation of these genes. The overexpression of
ribosomal protein genes, which constitute a subset of the protein
biosynthesis genes, is particularly striking. Twenty-nine of 74
ribosomal proteins genes whose probes were present in the U133A
chip were overexpressed in H-MM at a false discovery rate of 1% by
the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Sixty ribosomal protein
genes were overexpressed if a false discovery rate of 5% was used.
Interestingly, most of these overexpressed ribosomal protein genes
are located on the commonly trisomic chromosomes. When the
ratio of normalized expression of each ribosomal protein gene in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

H-MM compared with NH-MM was calculated, these were higher
for those genes present on the commonly trisomic chromosomes
with a ratio close to 1.5 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These findings
suggest the overexpression of ribosomal protein/protein biosynthesis genes in H-MM relative to NH-MM may be primarily due to
a gene dosage effect.
Recursive analysis reveals four putative clusters of H-MM.
Our recursive analysis identified four putative clusters of H-MM
characterized by the expression of largely mutually exclusive gene
sets (Fig. 2A). When the same 73 probe sets were used to cluster
the 63 relapsed H-MM patients entered into bortezomib trials, four
clusters were again apparent (Fig. 2B). When the 42 best matching
probe sets for the U95Av2 chip were used to cluster group 3
patients, the same four clusters can be identified (Fig. 2C),
suggesting the validity and reproducibility of the four clusters.
When the same gene list was used to cluster the 37 NH-MM in the
Mayo data set or 13 asymptomatic hyperdiploid tumors (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering
multiple myeloma), clusters expressing similar set of genes could
not be clearly identified (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that
these clusters identified by the specific gene expression signatures

Figure 2. Four subclasses of H-MM expressing largely mutually exclusive
gene sets are reproducible in different data sets. A, supervised clustering of
53 cases of H-MM according to the four putative subclasses identified
by recursive clustering analysis. Each cluster was characterized by
overexpression of largely nonoverlapping gene set. These gene sets seem
to belong to functional groups or pathways that are relevant to myeloma
biology. Cluster 1 is defined by CTA and mitosis/proliferation genes. Cluster
2 is defined by the overexpression of the HGF and IL6 genes. Cluster 3
is defined by genes involved in NF-nB signaling and antiapoptosis, in
particular those involved in NF-nB–induced antiapoptotic pathways. Cluster
4 is ill defined and seems to have the lowest expression of HGF. The genes
belonging to each cluster are indicated. B, using the same discriminating
genes, four clusters overexpressing similar genes were reproduced
in a separate cohort of 86 relapse and refractory H-MM patients entered
into bortezomib trials. C, similar clusters were again observed in 91 newly
diagnosed H-MM patients from University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
studied using the Affymetrix U95Av2 chip using the probes that best
matched the discriminating probes on the U133A chip.

seem to be unique to H-MM. Furthermore, a similar recursive
analysis of t(11;14) samples identifies subsets defined by genes that
are completely different from the genes that define the different
H-MM clusters.8
Cluster 1 was characterized by high expression of a large group
of cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes (CTAG, SSX, GAGE, and MAGE
families) and mitosis/proliferation-related genes (TOP2A, NEK,
ASPM, and CENPA). Cluster 2 was characterized by high expression
of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes.
Cluster 3 was characterized by high expression of genes involved in
NF-nB signaling and antiapoptosis (NFKB2, CFLAR, BIRC3, CKIP-1,
TNFAIP3, and RRAS2). Cluster 4 was less well defined except for
lack of high expression of the above genes with low expression of
HGF in particular. This was not the result of differences in
trisomies because there is significant overlap in the composite of
trisomies between these two clusters of patients.
Gene set enrichment analysis was done to derived greater
biological insights into the different clusters. Cluster 1 was

enriched for genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation as well
as genes with E2F binding motifs; cluster 2 was enriched for genes
involved in receptor-ligand signaling [e.g., insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)]; cluster 3 was enriched for
genes involved in activation of NF-nB pathways [e.g., tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 2, TNFa, NF-nB, and inflammatory
response pathways] and regulation of apoptosis (e.g., apoptosis and
death pathways), as well as genes with NF-nB binding motif; and
cluster 4 was enriched by genes involved in Wnt signaling
pathways (e.g., activin receptor–like kinase pathway and Wnt
targets; Supplementary Tables S5–S8). Of interest, the enriched
gene sets for the different clusters also seem to be mutually
exclusive, further suggesting that these different GEP-defined
clusters are likely to be biologically distinct.
GEP-identified H-MM subclasses have unique clinical
associations. Cluster 1 tumors were more proliferative (median
PCLI, 3.8; P < 0.05). Cluster 3 consisted of predominantly newly
diagnosed cases with none of the patients having International
Staging System stage III disease. There was no obvious association
between any of the clusters with bone disease and D13 (Table 2).

To assess if these signatures represented transcriptional switches
at progression, we compared the prevalence of these signatures in
the pooled newly diagnosed (group 1 and group 3 patients) and
relapsed cases (group 1 and group 2 patients). The prevalence of all
four clusters was similar in newly diagnosed compared with
relapsed cases (P = 0.16), suggesting that these profiles do not
represent progression signatures.
As cluster 3 was defined by a NF-nB signature, we hypothesized
that patients belonging to this cluster should have better response
to bortezomib. As predicted, cluster 3 patients had better response
to bortezomib compared with patients belonging to other clusters
(70% versus 29%; P = 0.02). On the other hand, there was no
statistically significant difference in response to dexamethasone
between cluster 3 patients and the others (36% versus 50%;
P = 0.24). The PFS of cluster 3 patients treated with bortezomib
was significantly longer (median PFS, 253 versus 90 days; log-rank
P = 0.0002), whereas if they were treated with dexamethasone, the
survival is not significantly different (median PFS, 94 versus 168
days; log-rank P = 0.17). When considering only cluster 3 patients,
the difference in PFS between bortezomib- and dexamethasonetreated patients was highly significant (median PFS, 253 versus 94
days; log-rank P = 0.0002). Furthermore, the PFS of cluster 3 H-MM
patients was almost twice as long as the PFS of all other patients,
including the NH-MM patients (median PFS, 253 versus 127 days;
log-rank P = 0.13), although this did not reach statistical
significance probably due to the relatively small number of cluster
3 patients (Fig. 3).
In addition, the four distinct patient clusters in group 1 had
significantly different survival. The median survival is 27 months
for cluster 1, not yet reached for cluster 2, 122 months for cluster 3,
and 49 months for cluster 4 (Fig. 4).
A recent study showed that H-MM patients with higher
prevalence of D13 and chromosome 1q amplification and lower
prevalence of trisomy 11 have poorer survival (6). Among our GEPdefined clusters, the prevalence of D13 and trisomy 11 were
similar. However, 1q amplification (assessed by gene expression–
derived pseudo-CGH; see Supplementary methods) was significantly more common in cluster 1 (cluster with worst prognosis). It
was therefore possible that the poor prognosis H-MM group
identified by Carrasco et al. is mainly mediated through
association with 1q amplification (and not D 13 or lack of trisomy
11) and may correspond to an underlying cluster 1 molecular

signature. The lack of association between D13 and the different HMM clusters with different survival in our data set is consistent
with recent findings that D13 is not associated with poorer
outcome in H-MM (20).

Discussion
Myeloma is composed of roughly equal fractions of hyperdiploid and nonhyperdiploid disease. Whereas the heterogeneity
of NH-MM is driven primarily by oncogenic translocations of
IgH enhancer sequences, the diversity of H-MM is poorly
understood. Although generally associated with a better prognosis compared with NH-MM, the median survival of H-MM is still
only f4 years with no plateau in the survival curve (20). Recent
studies have suggested possible clinical and molecular heterogeneity within H-MM (6, 15). However, there has been no comprehensive study that characterizes H-MM in terms of its
molecular phenotype and heterogeneity. In this study, we use
global GEP to first characterize the molecular signature of HMM and then to dissect the heterogeneity within H-MM. We
found that a protein biosynthesis signature that is primarily
driven by copy number changes characterizes H-MM. Furthermore, four biologically relevant subtypes with prognostic
implications were identified. More importantly, the results of
our study provide insights into the biology of H-MM and the
deregulated pathways underpinning these subtypes that can be
used to direct therapy.
The protein biosynthesis signature in H-MM is striking,
comprising a third of genes differentially expressed between HMM and NH-MM and constituting most of the genes overexpressed in H-MM relative to NH-MM. Importantly, this signature
has now been reproduced in two other studies by different groups
using different analysis methods. In a recently published study, in
an attempt to find gene signatures that define the different TC
groups, a similar signature was found in nine patients with low
(but abnormal) CCND1 expression and lacking IgH translocations,
which has been shown to correspond to H-MM patients. This
signature was reproduced by meta-analysis of two other data sets
(21). In another meeting report, a German group, in an attempt to
find genes that discriminate between multiple myeloma tumors
with and without chromosome 13 deletion, found that protein
biosynthesis genes predominate in tumors lacking chromosome

Gene Expression Profiling of Hyperdiploid Myeloma

Figure 3. Cluster 3 patients have better
PFS when treated with bortezomib
compared with dexamethasone. PFS of
cluster 3 patients were significantly longer
than the other H-MM patients when treated
with bortezomib [A ; median PFS, 253 d
(n = 11) versus 90 d (n = 18); log-rank
P = 0.04] whereas it was not significantly
different when treated with dexamethasone
[B ; median PFS, 94 d (n = 14) versus
168 d (n = 20); log-rank P = 017]. C, for
cluster 3 patients, those randomized to
bortezomib had significantly longer PFS
than those randomized to dexamethasone
[median PFS, 253 d (n = 11) versus 94 d
(n = 14); log-rank P = 0.0002].
D, furthermore, PFS of cluster 3 H-MM
patients (n = 11) was double that of all the
other patients (n = 69), including the
nonhyperdiploid patients, treated with
bortezomib in this data set (median PFS,
253 versus 127 dy log-rank P = 0.13).

13 deletion, which are mainly H-MM (22). In addition, there is
significant overlap between our H-MM signature and the top 50
genes overexpressed and underexpressed in the H-MM cluster in
a recent study from the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences (22 of 50 overexpressed and 19 of 50 underexpressed
genes; ref. 15).
Overexpression of protein biosynthesis genes, especially ribosome protein genes, may be the result of rapid cellular
proliferation and an indirect consequence of cellular transformation. This is unlikely to be the case in H-MM because these tumors
are not more proliferative than NH-MM. Instead, overexpression of
these genes seemed to be primarily driven by gene copy number. It
has been proposed that cells that contain more ribosomes and
translational initiation factors would have an increased translation
rate and promote transformation by actually promoting the
translation of proteins involved in cellular growth control (e.g.,
proto-oncogenes) or control of apoptosis (23). Consistent with this
view is our network analysis showing that many of the overexpressed genes in H-MM involved in ribosome/protein biosynthesis
represented end points of c-myc, NF-nB, and MAPK signaling.
Proteomic analysis will provide more insights into the functional
consequence of this protein biosynthesis gene expression signature, which may be important for maintenance of the tumor
phenotype and survival. As a result, this may represent an avenue
for therapeutic intervention of this subtype of multiple myeloma.
In our analysis, several components of the mammalian target of
rapamycin/P70S6 kinase pathways are deregulated in H-MM
compared with NH-MM (4EBP1, EIF4A, S6K1, RPS6, and EEF2),
suggesting that this pathway may be exploited therapeutically with
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (24).
Within H-MM, we identified four clusters that are reproducible
in two independent cohorts of patients with GEP done on different
generation of Affymetrix chips. In addition, these clusters are
highly reproducible despite using different patient populations
(newly diagnosed and relapsed) and different methods of defining

hyperdiploidy (although these methods are complementary).
Furthermore, these clusters are not related to differences in
genetic abnormalities or composite of trisomies or to changes
relating to progression.
The signature for each cluster provides insights into its biology.
Cluster 1 is defined by overexpression of various CTA genes and
mitosis/proliferation-related genes. Consistent with the latter,
the tumors seem to be more proliferative when assessed by
PCLI. Epigenetic mechanisms (hypomethylation) are implicated in
the expression of CTAs in tumors (25). It is therefore possible that
the expression of these genes is a surrogate for a deregulated
epigenetic mechanism that underlies cluster 1 tumors. Of interest,
hypomethylation and decondensation of centromeric heterochromatin

Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the 50 group 1 patients with available
survival data, stratified according to their GEP-defined clusters. Median survival
of cluster 1 patients (n = 11) is 27 mo, whereas median survival for cluster 2
(n = 11), cluster 3 (n = 13), and cluster 4 (n = 15) patients are not yet reached,
122 and 49 mo, respectively. On pairwise comparisons, only survival between
clusters 1 and 3 (P = 0.04) was significantly different.

have been implicated in the development of 1q amplification in
multiple myeloma (26), and 1q amplification is very common in
cluster 1 tumors. Indeed, epigenetic silencing of cell cycle
inhibitors (27–29) or increased copy number of critical cell cycle
gene on chromosome 1q such as CKS1B (30) may be responsible
for the proliferative phenotype. Cluster 2 is defined by the
overexpression of the HGF and IL6 genes. Deregulated HGF
signaling induced migration, survival, growth, and invasion of
cancer cells via multiple downstream pathways (31). Stimulation of
multiple myeloma cells with HGF led to the activation of the Ras/
MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways (32). HGF
also induces angiogenesis via VEGF. IL-6 mediates similar effects
on cellular phenotype and signals through similar pathways (33),
all of which are critical in multiple myeloma. Cluster 3 is defined
by the overexpression of genes involved in NF-nB signaling,
especially genes involved in NF-nB–induced antiapoptosis. NF-nB
signaling is constitutively active in multiple myeloma and is
important in mediating many downstream effects of the multiple
myeloma-bone marrow interaction (33). One of the important
consequences is the up-regulation of antiapoptotic molecules
resulting in drug resistance and survival of myeloma cells.
Therefore, these signatures may represent divergent pathways in
H-MM.
More importantly, these disparate and distinct deregulated
pathways provide a useful means for targeting subset of patients
with specific therapy. A proof of this principle was provided by the
analysis of response and progression of bortezomib-treated
patients (group 2) belonging to the different clusters. The NF-nB
pathway is one of the key therapeutic targets of bortezomib (34),
and, as predicted, cluster 3 patients have better response and PFS
when treated with bortezomib compared with dexamethasone,
whereas this difference is not observed for the other clusters.
Although the number of patients included in this analysis is small,
the results are rather striking and are probably real. Our results will
have to be confirmed in larger cohorts of H-MM patients in the
future.
Many CTAs contain epitopes recognized by CTLs and are
potential targets for active immunotherapy (24). Several of these
antigens have been identified as potential targets for immunotherapy in multiple myeloma (35, 36). A possible treatment
strategy for cluster 1 patients may therefore involve immunotherapy to eradicate residual clone following standard induction with
stem cell transplantation. For cluster 2 patients, critical activated
pathways (Ras/MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt)
could be targeted (37, 38).

The clinical outcome of these clusters is different, adding
credence to the biological validity and distinction of these
subtypes. Cluster 1 patients have the worst prognosis. Expression
of CTA has been associated with poor prognosis in other cancer,
and the more proliferative nature of these tumors may contribute
to the poor prognosis. However, when all patients with proliferative tumors (PCLI z 1) are considered, cluster 1 patients still have
significantly worse survival (data not shown). Importantly,
although H-MM patients are generally thought to have good
prognosis, a cohort of patients (cluster 1) with survival of only f2
years could be identified.
Recently, Zhan et al. (15) have published an unsupervised
molecular classification of myeloma. They identified a hyperdiploid
cluster that contained most of the hyperdiploid cases and a
proliferation cluster that also contained some hyperdiploid cases.
This proliferation cluster (also express some CTAs) is associated
with 1q amplification and poor prognosis and, hence, is similar to
the cluster 1 identified in the current study. As their study aimed to
derive a molecular classification of all multiple myeloma, they did
not identify additional subtypes of H-MM. In the current study, we
specifically wanted to molecularly dissect H-MM and have
identified additional clusters including one with NF-nB signature
that respond very well to bortezomib.
In summary, H-MM is characterized by a protein biosynthesis
signature. In addition, four subclasses of H-MM with distinct
clinical and biological associations could be identified, including a
subgroup that have very bad prognosis and a subgroup that
response particularly well to bortezomib. The gene signature
associated with each subclass provides a molecular basis for the
different clinical behavior and further insights into the deregulated pathways in H-MM that could potentially be exploited
therapeutically.
