ypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare hematologic disorder
characterized by the overproduction of eosinophils in the bone
marrow, eosinophilia, tissue infiltration, and end-organ damage by
eosinophil infiltration and secretion of mediators.1 The diagnosis of
HES is based on marked eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count
>1.5 3 109/L), chronic course (>6 months), exclusion of other evident etiologies for eosinophilia (eg, parasitic infestations, allergic diseases, Hodgkin disease, and metastatic cancer), and signs and
symptoms of eosinophil-mediated tissue injury (eg, cardiomyopathy,
gastroenteritis, pneumonitis, cutaneous lesions, sinusitis, neurologic
and ophtalmologic manifestations, and vasculitis).2–5 Over the last
few years, considerable insights with regard to the pathogenesis of
HES have been gained that have highlighted the marked heterogeneity of patients with this disorder. A diagnosis of ‘‘true’’ HES, according
to World Health Organization, is predicated on demonstrating the absence of any molecular or cytogenetic features of clonality or any
bone marrow findings suggesting an abnormal population of mast
cells, monocytosis, or evidence of trilineage myeloproliferation or
dysplasia.6,7 It is now clear that there are at least 3 distinct groups of
patients among those who previously were diagnosed with ‘‘idio-

pathic’’ HES. First, a subset of patients has been
reclassified with ‘‘clonal’’ eosinophilia (chronic eosinophilic leukemia [CEL]) because of the identification
of the Fip1-like 1/platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) fusion transcript.8–11
These patients require a different therapeutic approach,
which is addressed separately below. Second, there is
a subset of patients with HES in which no evidence of
clonality can be demonstrated with currently available
techniques, and they still have disease that must be
considered ‘‘idiopathic.’’ However, it is well documented that patients with ‘‘idiopathic’’ HES who present
without any distinct cytogenetic abnormalities may
have disease that ultimately evolves into acute leukemia or aggressive forms of myeloproliferative disorders.12,13 The disease in this group often is referred to
as a myeloproliferative variant of HES. Finally, there is
a third subset of patients that carries an abnormal Tcell population (helper Th2 lymphocytes), detectable
either by flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction
analysis,14–16 that produces interleukin-5 (IL-5), a
cytokine required for the growth and differentiation of
eosinophils.17 These patients have disease that frequently is referred to as a lymphoproliferative variant
of ‘‘idiopathic’’ HES. This likely incomplete division
has had direct implications regarding treatment
options for these patients. Hence, the distinction
between clonal and idiopathic eosinophilia is not conspicuous in many instances, which does not necessarily suggest monoclonal proliferation of eosinophils in
the HES but, rather, highlights the absence of such
evidence.18 Readers are referred to an excellent recent
review of the pathophysiology of blood eosinophilia
that includes a detailed summary of all new molecular
discoveries; the current report should be considered a
companion to that summary by Tefferi et al.,19
because we focus on the treatment options for these
patients.

Cytotoxic Therapy
Idiopathic HES
Numerous cytotoxic approaches have been used in
the treatment of HES and still are considered frontline therapy for patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative disease. The first descriptions of HES were associated with a median survival of approximately 9
months. The main culprit for this grim outcome was
end-organ damage because of tissue infiltration by
eosinophils, chiefly leading to cardiovascular damage
(congestive heart failure, endocarditis, atrioventricular valvular incompetence, thomboemboli) as the primary cause of death.3 Therefore, the major objective
of therapy for patients with HES has been aggressive
debulking of the eosinophil burden in an attempt to

prevent damage to vital organs. Prompt responses
usually were observed in patients who received prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily. Unfortunately,
some patients exhibited resistance to corticosteroids,
and most developed recurrent disease during steroid
tapering,2,3 thus requiring additional therapy. Furthermore, long-term corticosteroid therapy has been
associated with potentially serious side effects.
Oral hydroxyurea administered at an initial dose
of 500 mg daily is highly effective in corticosteroidresistant patients.20 Anemia and thrombocytopenia
are the main associated toxicities, but these may be
managed with dose reductions or temporal hydroxyurea discontinuation.2 A variety of other cytotoxic
agents have been described anecdotally for the treatment of HES. Intravenous vincristine at doses from
1.5 mg to 2 mg at 2-week intervals has been beneficial in several patients.21 Its main limitation is the
development of neurotoxicity, which sometimes may
be difficult to distinguish from the peripheral neuropathy associated with HES. Antimetabolites, such
as 6-tioguanine,22 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, cytarabine,23 methotrexate, and colchicine,24 reportedly
had only a partial and transient effect on eosinophil
counts. Etoposide was administered to 1 patient with
HES and effectively controlled the symptoms, but
treatment had to be terminated because of bone
marrow suppression.25 Alkylating agents, such as
chlorambucil2 and cyclophosphamide,26 have produced acceptable long-term control of the disease in
some patients.

FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL
Because of highly successful therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate, cytotoxic therapy may be considered as second-line
therapy for patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive
CEL in the event of resistance or intolerance to TKI
treatment.
Immunosuppressant Agents
Idiopathic HES
An alternative approach to the treatment of HES is
the employment of immunomodulatory/immunosuppressant agents. The rationale for the use of such
an approach has been provided by the demonstration of a clonal and immunophenotypically aberrant
T-cell population in a subset of patients with HES.14–16
Thus, a second line of treatment in HES has been
the administration of interferon-a, conventionally at
a dose ranging from 1 million to 8 million units 3
times per week subcutaneously. Numerous reports
have documented long-lasting improvements in the
majority of patients who were treated in such fash-

New Therapies for HES/Kalac et al.

ion24,27,28 with control of symptoms and with significant decreases in eosinophil counts and eosinophil
major protein levels.29,30 Frequently, the initial dose
needs to be tapered because of cytopenias, primarily
thrombocytopenia. A wide array of side effects has
been described with the use of interferon-a that frequently results in high drop-out rates. Occasionally,
cessation of interferon-a has been linked to rebound
eosinophilia.31,32 Cyclosporine A also has been used
in the treatment of HES. An oral dose of 6 mg/kg
daily reportedly was effective for controlling HESrelated symptoms.33,34 The use of azathioprine has
been described in several case reports as effective for
controlling symptoms in patients with HES, likely
reflecting the immunologic nature of some types of
HES.35–37

FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL
With the availability of TKIs and cytotoxic medications, the immunomodulatory/immunosuppressant
agents have little role in the therapy for patients with
FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL.
Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
Idiopathic HES
The first described case of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in a patient with HES who had
only had a transient response to conventional treatment with corticosteroids and hydroxyurea was
reported in 1988. This patient had a full hematologic
recovery but died within 3 months after transplantation because of diffuse cytomegalovirus infection.38
Subsequent reports of successful allo-SCT have disclosed significant rates of complete remission from 8
months to 40 months after transplantation using either bone marrow39,40 or peripheral blood41,42 as the
source of stem cells. A nonmyeloablative allo-SCT
after a reduced-intensity preparative regimen of melphalan and fludarabine reportedly induced a complete remission that lasted longer than 10 months in
2 patients with HES.43 In both patients, complete donor chimerism was achieved, providing proof of principle for the feasibility of nonmyeloablative allo-SCT
for patients with HES, who can develop important
comorbidity secondary to organ eosinophilic infiltration. Currently, allo-SCT still is considered an investigational modality for patients with HES and should
be recommended only to those patients who do not
respond or who have primary disease that is resistant
to cytotoxic and immunosuppressant therapy.
FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL
Recently, it was reported that the FIP1L1-PDGFRA
fusion transcript could be eradicated completely af-

957

ter allo-SCT.44 However, because imatinib therapy
has been proven effective in eradicating the disease
in the great majority of patients with FIP1L1PDGFRA-positive CEL, and because patients who are
resistant or intolerant to imatinib most likely can be
salvaged with newer TKIs and cytotoxic medications,
allo-SCT should be considered ‘‘the last resort’’
approach for these patients.

TKIs
The use of TKIs as therapy for patients with HES is
related closely to the discovery of the FIP1L1PDGFRA oncogene in responding patients. This set
the stage for a revision of the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for HES and led to the reclassification of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive disease as CEL.
Therefore, below, the use of TKIs in these patients is
described first.
FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL
Imatinib mesylate. Imatinib selectively inhibits a series of protein tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl, Kit,
PDGFRA, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor b
(PDGFRB), among others. The activity of this TKI
against Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines was described first in
199645 and was followed readily by further studies
translating this activity into the clinical arena, which
led to the rapid approval of imatinib for the treatment
of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).46–49 Before
the discovery of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion oncogene,
it had been documented in several reports that
empiric therapy with imatinib induced rapid and dramatic complete hematologic remission in patients
with HES at doses ranging between 75 mg and 400 mg
daily.26,50–52 Gleich et al. reported on 5 patients who
received imatinib at a dose of 100 mg daily. It is interesting to note that, in that study, 4 men who had normal serum IL-5 concentrations achieved complete
hematologic responses, whereas a woman who had an
increased serum IL-5 concentration failed to respond.
All patients who responded stopped other treatments
and reduced imatinib mesylate to a dose of 200 mg
per week. The exact mechanism by which imatinib
exerted such a powerful effect in patients with HES
was unknown at that time but suggested the possibility of the presence of an activated kinase, such as Abl,
PDGFR, or kit receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), all of
which are targets of imatinib.51 Cools et al. identified
an interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12, which
was undetectable by conventional cytogenetic techniques, that resulted in the fusion FIP1L1-PDGFRA kinase in 9 of 16 patients with HES and in 5 of 9
patients who achieved durable responses to imatinib.1
In vitro, imatinib mesylate inhibited the constitutively

active FIP1L1-PDGFRA tyrosine kinase with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 3.2 nM, significantly lower than the value obtained in Bcr-Ablexpressing cell lines (>250 mM),1,53 further supporting
the clinical efficacy of this TKI in patients who harbor
the transcript.1 These results also were confirmed in
the EOL-1 cell line, which was derived from a patient
with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive leukemia.54 It is noteworthy that the FIP1L1-PDGFRA transcript can be
detected in early hematopoietic progenitors and, in
rare instances, in systemic mastocytosis associated
with eosinophilia55,56; and the presence of the FIP1L1PDGFRA fusion kinase usually is associated with elevated serum levels of tryptase and vitamin B12.57,58
The clinical activity of imatinib in the treatment of
patients with CEL has been confirmed in multiple
reports,59–62 and there is general consensus regarding
the use of imatinib as first-line therapy in patients who
express FIP1L1-PDGFRA. The incidence of FIP1L1PDGFRA-positive patients with eosinophilia, however,
is not high. Although it was reported initially in 9 of 16
patients who were tested, a more recent analysis of the
presence of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in samples from much
larger groups of patients with eosinophilia suggested
that its incidence was as low as 4%.63
Despite its impressive activity in patients with
FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL, imatinib therapy has
been associated with important side effects, including oligospermia and, more important, cardiac
events.64,65 In fact, several reports of acute imatinibinduced left heart failure have been reported during
the first 14 days of therapy with imatinib.65 Patients
with potential cardiac involvement can be identified
before the start of imatinib by echocardiography
and determination of serum troponin levels. The
presence of elevated levels of troponin T before
and right after the onset of imatinib therapy accurately predicts the development of acute left
ventricular dysfunction.65 In these instances, pretreatment with systemic corticosteroids is highly
recommended.65
Paralleling the experience in patients with CML,
imatinib resistance also has been observed in
patients with CEL who were treated with this TKI.
The FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I mutant isoform is homologous to BCR-ABL T315I in CML and confers remarkable resistance to imatinib. To our knowledge to
date, only 2 cases of CEL with acquired imatinib resistance have been reported.1,51 In both patients, a
T674I mutation in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)binding domain of PDGFRA was identified. Other alternative mechanisms linked to imatinib resistance
have been described in CML, including Bcr-Abl overexpression, extracellular sequestration of imatinib by

a-1-acid glycoprotein, and an enhanced active imatinib efflux by transmembrane pump proteins, such as
multidrug resistance/p-glycoprotein.66,67 These mechanisms also are likely to be encountered in patients
with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL.
Increasing concerns regarding the development
of clinical resistance to imatinib, along with the finding that severe side effects have been observed in
some patients during imatinib therapy, have paved
the way for the investigation of novel molecules with
augmented potency and favorable toxicity profiles.68–70
Research involving other small-molecule TKIs has
yielded several compounds with excellent pharmacokinetic profile and high efficacy as inhibitors of the
FIP1L1-PDGFRA kinase.
Nilotinib. Nilotinib (AMN107) is an aminopyrimidine
derivative that was designed rationally based on the
crystallographic structure of the imatinib-Bcr-Abl
complex.70 The replacement of the N-methylpiperazine ring in the imatinib molecule has led to a compound that, similar to imatinib, is a competitive
inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of Bcr-Abl.71 It has
been demonstrated that nilotinib is from 20-fold to
30-fold more potent than imatinib as an Abl inhibitor
in imatinib-sensitive CML cell lines and from 3-fold
to 7-fold more potent in imatinib-resistant cell
lines.71,72 Nilotinib has excellent pharmacokinetic
and safety profiles,71,73–75 and it has demonstrated
activity in clinical trials involving patients with disease that was CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib.76 The activity of nilotinib against other kinases,
such as KIT, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB, has been investigated.76 The ranking of nilotinib activity against
these kinases is different for nilotinib (Bcr-Abl>
PDGFR>KIT) compared with imatinib (PDGFR>
KIT>Bcr-Abl).77 It has been demonstrated that nilotinib inhibits cell proliferation driven by PDGFRA and
PDGFRB in vitro and is effective in controlling myeloproliferative disease caused by TEL-PDGFRB and
FIP1L1-PDGFRA in murine bone marrow transplantation models. However, there are somewhat conflicting reports regarding the activity of nilotinib against
the PDGFRA T674I mutant kinase. Initial reports suggested that nilotinib was able to overcome the resistance conferred by the imatinib resistant point
mutation T681I but had no activity against the
PDGFRA T674I mutated kinase.75,76 However, recent
reports have indicated that nilotinib is capable of
suppressing the growth of Ba/F3 cells transfected
with FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I with an IC50 of 376
nM.78 These results indicated that therapy with nilotinib may override imatinib resistance conferred by
FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I kinase.

New Therapies for HES/Kalac et al.

Dasatinib. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is an oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor with potent activity against
the Bcr-Abl (IC50, <1 nM), KIT (IC50, 13 nM),
PDGFRB (IC50, 28 nM), and epithelial cell kinase A2
(IC50, 17 nM) receptor kinases, among others.62,79–81
Dasatinib is approximately 300-fold more potent
against Bcr-Abl than imatinib and is active against
all tested Abl mutant isoforms except for T315I.
Dasatinib has demonstrated high efficacy in Phase I
and II studies in patients with CML or with Bcr-Ablpositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia after failure
on imatinib therapy.82 The clinical activity of dasatinib in patients with CML and its potent activity
against PDGFR provide the foundation for its possible use in patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive
CEL who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.
Sorafenib. Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) initially was identified in 2001 as a potent B-RAF and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor and,
subsequently, demonstrated the ability to inhibit the
fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), KIT, and PDGFR
tyrosine kinases.83 Sorafenib recently was approved
for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma84
and currently is being tested in clinical trials for the
treatment of a variety of solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer.85–87 Results from these studies have
demonstrated that steady-state concentrations of up
to 4 lM are safely achievable in patients with a dose
of 100 mg daily.86 It was reported recently that sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of FIP1L1-PDGFRAand FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I-transformed Ba/F3 cells
with IC50 values of 4 nM and 54 nM, respectively. In
addition, sorafenib induced apoptosis of the EOL-1
cell line at a low nanomolar concentration (IC50, 0.5
nM). Western blot analysis confirmed that sorafenib
directly inhibited the phosphorylation of FIP1L1PDGFRA, FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I, and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Overall, these
data suggest that sorafenib is another promising candidate for the treatment of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive
patients to overcome imatinib resistance associated
with the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674I.88,89
PKC412. PKC412 is a staurosporine derivative that
originally was identified as an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), but it subsequently demonstrated the
ability to inhibit other kinases, including VEGFR,
FLT3, KIT, kinase insert domain receptor, and
PDGFR.90 PKC412 has demonstrated broad antiproliferative activity against various tumors and normal
cell lines in vitro91: It enhances sensitivity to radiation, and it potentiates the in vivo antitumor activity
of some cytotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin.92

959

Phase I studies have demonstrated that PKC412 has
a good pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration,93 and Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated
that it has clinical activity in patients with acute
myelogenous leukemia who have blasts with an
activating mutation of FLT3, suggesting its potential
use in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents.94,95
PKC412 inhibited the growth of FIP1L1-PDGFRAexpressing Ba/F3 cells with a cellular IC50 of approximately 130 nM.96 However, Ba/F3 cells that were
transformed with FIP1L1-PDGFRA N659D were not
inhibited at concentrations of PKC412 as high as
400 nM.94 It is noteworthy that PKC412 inhibited the
proliferation of Ba/F3 cells that were transformed by
FIP1L1-PDGFRA harboring the T674I mutation with
an IC50 of approximately 100 nM.94 The efficacy of
PKC412 also was evaluated in a murine bone marrow
transplantation model of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-induced
myeloproliferative disease. Recipient mice were divided into 3 groups that received treatment with
imatinib, PKC412, or placebo, respectively. Mice that
were treated with imatinib and transplanted with
bone marrow cells expressing the FIP1L1-PDGFRA
T674I imatinib-resistant mutation developed disease
with the same penetrance as the placebo-treated
mice. However, administration of PKC412 to animals
with myeloproliferative disease induced by the FIP1L1PDGFRA T674I transcript led to significant prolongation of survival and reductions of leukocyte counts and
spleen weight compared with placebo-treated animals.
These data suggest that PKC412 may represent a molecularly targeted therapy for CEL and other diseases
that express activated PDGFRA regardless of the presence of the imatinib-resistant T674I mutation.94

Idiopathic HES
Imatinib therapy is not recommended initially for
patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative HES. However, a trial of imatinib therapy may be justified in
these patients when they become refractory to conventional cytotoxic or immunomodulatory/immunosuppressant therapy, because a fraction of these
patients can respond to imatinib.1 Further investigations are warranted to define the molecular basis of
imatinib response in patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRAnegative HES.97 This may be explained, for example,
by the existence of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcripts with different breakpoints within the FIP1L1
gene, the presence of fusion transcripts involving a
gene adjacent to FIP1L1 that could partner with
PDGFRA, the fusion of the KIT gene with PDGFRA,
or the presence of a yet to be discovered fusion kinase amenable to inhibition by imatinib.1

Other newer TKIs are being evaluated in clinical
trials for patients wit HES. Although preclinical studies
of these medications have been conducted in PDGFRexpressing models, as described above, the number of
FIP1L1-PDGFRA-expressing patients with resistance to
imatinib is extremely low, and this group is not amenable to the conduct of clinical studies. Because several other tyrosine kinases (eg, KIT) may be involved
in the pathophysiology of HES and may be affected by
newer TKIs, it is reasonable to study them in patients
with ‘‘idiopathic’’ HES that does not respond to standard therapies. Data on 11 patients with HES who were
treated with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily in a Phase II
trial recently were reported.98 Although nilotinib therapy, in general, was well tolerated, only 1 patient (9%)
achieved a complete response, whereas 5 other
patients (45%) had stable disease. Dasatinib is another
new TKI that currently is being evaluated in patients
with ‘‘idiopathic’’ HES.

Monoclonal Antibodies
Idiopathic HES
Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies. IL-5 is a major
cytokine that is involved selectively in the maturation, activation, and proliferation of eosinophils, and
elevated levels of IL-5 are encountered commonly in
patients with HES.99 IL-5 is produced mainly by Th2
lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils; therefore,
it represents a potential target for the treatment of
HES.15 Two humanized monoclonal antibodies
(MoAbs) against IL-5 have been used in clinical trials
involving patients with eosinophil diseases, SB240563 or mepolizumab, a humanized mouse
MoAb,100 and SCH 55700, a humanized rat MoAb.101
These antibodies were developed initially for the
treatment of bronchial asthma in humans, although,
unfortunately, the initial results in that setting were
disappointing.102 Administration of mepolizumab to
patients with asthma significantly lowered peripheral
blood and sputum eosinophil counts, but it did not
have an effect on the airway hyperresponsiveness or
on the allergen-induced, late asthmatic response, despite reducing lung eosinophil levels by 55%.103,104
What to our knowledge is the first case report of
mepolizumab therapy in a patient with HES was
published in 2003.105 Mepolizumab administered at a
dose of 750 mg 3 times per week effectively reduced
serum IL-5 levels and peripheral blood eosinophil
counts and markedly relieved the HES-related symptoms. However, this response was transient and was
followed by rebound eosinophilia within days after
the last administration of the MoAb.105 These results
were confirmed later in a pilot study that involved 3
patients who had HES and eosinophilic dermatitis

and who experienced rapid relief of skin symptoms
and pruritus and normalization of blood eosinophil
counts within 24 hours of intravenous administration
of mepolizumab.106 Results from an international,
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of mepolizumab in patients with HES
recently have been reported.107 In total, 85 patients
with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative HES who received
from 20 mg to 60 mg daily of prednisone monotherapy to maintain a blood eosinophil count <1 3 109/
L were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive
intravenous mepolizumab 750 mg (n 5 43 patients)
or saline (n 5 42 patients) every 4 weeks for 36
weeks. Prednisone was tapered at weekly intervals after the first infusion according to blood eosinophil
counts and clinical criteria. Overall, 84% of patients
on the mepolizumab arm achieved the primary endpoint of decreasing the prednisone requirements
below 10 mg daily for at least 8 consecutive weeks,
compared with 43% of patients who were randomized
to the placebo arm (P < .001). The time required to
achieve this endpoint was significantly shorter in the
mepolizumab arm than in the placebo arm (P 5 .002).
In addition, more patients who were randomized to
receive mepolizumab achieved an eosinophil count
<0.6 3 109/L for at least 8 consecutive weeks (95% vs
45%; P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 4.74–75.17%).
These findings indicate that mepolizumab holds promise because of its lack of serious side effects and its
effectiveness in patients with ‘‘idiopathic’’ HES.
Anti-CD52 MoAbs. Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH) is an
MoAb that targets the CD52 surface protein that is
expressed on the surface of human eosinophils.
Blockade of CD52 by mouse anti-CD52 MoAb (immunoglobulin G3 [IgG3]) and humanized anti-CD52
MoAb (IgG1) with goat-antimouse antibody and mouseantihuman antibody, respectively, resulted in dosedependent inhibition of reactive oxygen species
production of eosinophils after stimulation with C5a,
platelet-activating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor.108 Thus, CD52 blockade may be relevant clinically by reducing the
deleterious effects of human eosinophils in the inflammatory tissue. The initial evidence of the activity
of alemtuzumab in HES was provided by 2 case
reports of patients who were refractory to imatinib
and nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood
SCT.109,110 More recently, a pilot trial of alemtuzumab
in 9 patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative HES was
reported.111 Alemtuzumab was administered in weekly
cycles at a dose of 30 mg (8 patients) or 10 mg (1
patient) 3 times per week either intravenously or subcutaneously. The median absolute eosinophil count

New Therapies for HES/Kalac et al.

was 9 3 109/L (range, 0.7–30 3 109/L). Patients had
received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 2–6
prior therapies), including prednisone (n 5 9 patients),
imatinib (n 5 7 patients), dasatinib (n 5 3 patients),
interferon-a (n 5 3 patients), nilotinib (n 5 2 patients), and cladribine (n 5 2 patients). A complete
normalization of the peripheral blood eosinophil count
was observed in 8 patients (89%) within 4 weeks of
therapy and was undetectable in 6 of them. However,
5 patients who were withdrawn from alemtuzumab
therapy developed recurrent disease after a median of
3.5 weeks (range, 1–10 weeks), and 1 patient developed recurrent disease while receiving alemtuzumab
after 14 weekly cycles. Three patients remain on alemtuzumab treatment; 2 are receiving 30 mg weekly as
maintenance while they remain in complete hematologic response after 8 weeks and 19 weeks, respectively; and 1 patient with a partial response is
receiving 30 mg 3 times per week. One patient who
developed recurrent disease was rechallenged with
alemtuzumab and, once again, achieved a normalized
eosinophil count. Alemtuzumab generally was well tolerated, and only 2 patients experienced cytomegalovirus reactivation. These data underscore the remarkable
activity of alemtuzumab in patients with FIP1L1PDGFRA-negative HES. These results warrant further
confirmation in larger clinical trials.

For the great majority of patients who are negative for the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase, those with
‘‘idiopathic’’ HES, aside from the standard therapies
with corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, and interferon-a,
MoAb therapy (mepolizumab and alemtuzumab)
appears to be a major new therapeutic approach;
however, the hope is that the current intensive
search for new molecular abnormalities in this disease will reveal potential targets for the development
of novel targeted therapies. Finally, for patients who
have disease that is resistant to medical therapy,
allo-SCT may be a curative option.

FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL
Because of the remarkable activity of imatinib in
these patients and the availability of other standard
therapies, MoAbs currently have no role as therapies
for patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL.
Conclusions
Recent advances in the pathogenesis of HES/CEL
have facilitated the development of more effective
drugs for patients with these myeloproliferative disorders. In this regard, the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase has become an appealing target after its
description in a subset of patients. This kinase is
amenable to inhibition with small-molecule TKIs,
such as imatinib and nilotinib. An important aspect
of therapy with these agents is the development of
resistance, which has been associated with the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA T674 mutant isoform.
This mutation is homologous to the T315I mutation
occurring in the kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, which confers insensitivity to imatinib,
nilotinib, and dasatinib in patients with CML. Fortunately, alternative approaches, such as novel TKIs
(eg, PKC412, sorafenib) or MoAbs against IL-5
(mepolizumab) or CD52 (alemtuzumab), may prove
effective in this setting.
