Abstract
Obesity is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and
obese breast cancer patients exhibit a higher risk for larger
tumor burden and increased metastasis. Obesity, as associated
with metabolic syndrome, results in an increase in circulating
insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which acts as a mitogen.
In addition, higher plasma level of adipocytokine leptin is
associated with obesity. In the present study, we show that
cotreatment with leptin and IGF-I significantly increases
proliferation as well as invasion and migration of breast
cancer cells. We found a novel bidirectional crosstalk between
leptin and IGF-I signaling; IGF-I induced phosphorylation of
leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) and leptin induced phosphorylation of
IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), whereas cotreatment induced synergistic phosphorylation and association of Ob-Rb and IGF-IR
along with activation of downstream effectors, Akt and
extracellular signal–regulated kinase. Leptin increased phosphorylation of IGF signaling molecules insulin-receptor
substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2. Interestingly, we found that leptin
and IGF-I cotreatment synergistically transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), depending on the
proteolytic release of EGFR ligands, as the broad-spectrum
matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 could inhibit this
effect. Using clinically relevant EGFR inhibitors, erlotinib and
lapatinib, we found that inhibition of EGFR activation
effectively inhibited leptin- and IGF-I–induced invasion and
migration of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these data
suggest a novel bidirectional crosstalk between leptin and
IGF-I signaling that transactivates EGFR and promotes the
metastatic properties as well as invasion and migration of
breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate the possibility of
using EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and lapatinib to counter the
procancerous effects of leptin and IGF-I in breast cancers.

(1, 2). Epidemiologic studies have shown that obese women are
more likely to have metastatic breast cancer when they are first
diagnosed and have a poor final outcome (3, 4). Several hypotheses
have been proposed to explain this association. Whereas particular
emphasis has been placed on the increased production of estrogen
from peripheral aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue (5),
obesity has also been associated with metabolic syndrome and
increased levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I; ref. 6). Recent
studies have put forth obesity as an endocrine tumor and placed
high levels of adipocytokine leptin and its autocrine, paracrine, and
endocrine functions at center stage (7, 8) to explain the molecular
effects of obesity.
Leptin, a product of the obese (ob) gene, is a multifunctional
adipocytokine (9) with wide-ranging biological activities including
appetite regulation, bone formation, reproductive function, and
angiogenesis (9). In recent years, many labs including ours have
shown that leptin increased proliferation of breast and many other
cancer cells via multiple signaling pathways (refs. 10–12; reviewed
in ref. 13). Leptin receptors were not detectable in normal
mammary epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry, whereas
carcinoma cells showed positive staining for leptin receptor in
83% of cases (14). Importantly, overexpression of leptin was
observed in 92% of breast tumors examined whereas none of the
normal breast epithelium examined showed leptin overexpression
(14). Another noteworthy study showing a positive relationship
between blood leptin levels and breast cancer risk also found that
the degree of leptin mRNA expression in the peritumoral adipose
tissue was significantly higher in the breast cancer patients than in
the control women (15). One recent study also showed that leptin
and leptin receptor are overexpressed in primary and metastatic
invasive ductal breast carcinoma compared with noncancer
mammary tissue (16). Collectively, these studies suggest the
importance of leptin signaling in breast carcinogenesis.
Several studies of different populations, genders, and age groups
have found a nonlinear relationship between circulating concentrations of IGF-I and body mass index (BMI), with the highest
concentrations of IGF-I at a BMI between 24 and 27 kg/m2
(reviewed in ref. 17). High IGF-I levels positively correlate with
increased breast cancer risk (18, 19). Overexpression of IGF-I leads
to excessive proliferation and survival signals for the development
of breast tumor (20). IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) is overexpressed in
f50% of primary breast tumors compared with normal tissue,
indicating that these carcinomas have enhanced responses to the
mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I (21). Inactivation of
IGF-IR results in reduced breast tumor growth and metastasis
in vivo (22). Recent advances in signal transduction biology have
put forth crosstalk between different membrane receptor as a

well-established concept. Given the importance of obesity-related
increased levels of IGF-I and leptin in breast carcinogenesis and
overexpression of both IGF-IR and Ob-Rb in breast tumors (14, 21),
we hypothesized that leptin and IGF-I signaling might interact and
synergize to produce enhanced procancerous effects. Intriguingly,
we found a novel bidirectional crosstalk between leptin and IGF-I
signaling that leads to synergistic transactivation of epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). We further investigated the
effects of leptin and IGF-I signaling on the malignant properties of
breast cancer cells, including invasion and migration, and the
importance of EGFR transactivation.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies. Antibodies for phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-extracellular
signal–regulated kinase (ERK), ERK, IGF-IR, p-Tyr, EGFR, insulin-receptor
substrate (IRS)-1, and IRS-2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antibodies for short and long forms of leptin receptors Ob-R (C-20), Ob-R
(B-3), and Ob-R (H-300) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Cell cultures, reagents, and treatments. The human breast cancer cell
lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products) and
2 Amol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen). HCC-1806 cells were maintained in
RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 Amol/L L-glutamine. MDA-MB231, MDA-MB-468, and HCC-1806 are triple-negative breast cancer cells as
they lack expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and
also lack overexpression of HER2 (23). For treatment, cells were seeded at a
density of 1 106 per 100-mm tissue culture dish. After 24 h of serum
starvation, the complete culture media were changed to serum-free media
containing treatments as indicated. Cultures were treated with human
recombinant leptin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 ng/mL (12) and/or IGF-I (SigmaAldrich) at 100 ng/mL (24). An EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478
(Sigma-Aldrich), was used at 250 nmol/L for indicated durations (25). The
broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 (25)
was purchased from Calbiochem. EGFR inhibitors lapatinib (GlaxoSmithKline) and erlotinib (OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) were used at 2.5 Amol/L for
indicated durations (26, 27). For electric cell-substrate impedance sensing
(ECIS) migration assay, ECIS cell cultureware was purchased from Applied
BioPhysics.
Immunoprecipitation of Ob-Rb, IGF-IR, and EGFR. For immunoprecipitation (11, 12), whole-cell lysate from breast cancer cells was incubated
with specific antibodies for Ob-R (C-20; specific for long form of leptin
receptor), IGF-IR, or EGFR and the mixture was rotated slowly at 4jC for
16 h. A total of 20 AL of packed protein A/G agarose beads were added and
mixture was incubated at 4jC for 1 h with rotation. The beads were
collected by gentle centrifugation and washed twice with 1.5 mL ice-cold
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1%
NP40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin]. After the final wash, the
precipitated protein-bead complexes were resuspended in SDS sample
loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection was done by blocking the membranes
for 1 h in TBS buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20] containing 5% powdered nonfat milk followed by addition of the
primary antibody, as indicated, in TBS for 2 h at room temperature.
Specifically bound primary antibodies were detected with peroxidasecoupled secondary antibodies and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blot. Whole-cell lysate was prepared by scraping cells in 250 AL
of ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.25% Nadeoxycholate, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/L NaF; refs. 10, 11]. The lysate was rotated
360 degrees for 1 h at 4jC followed by centrifugation at 12,000  g for
10 min at 4jC to clear the cellular debris. Total protein was quantified with

www.aacrjournals.org

the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amount of protein was
resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membrane; Western blot analysis was done with the previously described
antibodies. Immunodetection was done using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability assay was done (12) by estimating
reduction of 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5carboxyanilide (XTT) using a commercially available kit (Roche Applied
Science) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Breast cancer cells were
plated in 96-well plates at an initial density of 4  103 per well for 24 h. After
16 h of serum starvation, the culture media were changed to serum-free
media containing treatments as indicated. XTT labeling reagent was added
to each culture well to attain a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL. After a
4-h exposure at 37jC, absorbance was measured at 450 and 690 nm using
a 96-well plate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS, Molecular Devices). Pilot
experiments verified that the cell densities used in the experiments were
within the linear range of the XTT assay. A standard curve was prepared
using cell densities from 1  103 to 1  106, and the result was calculated
with respect to the number of cells.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt activity assay. Mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt were immunoprecipitated with
the specific antibodies following the immunoprecipitation protocol as
described above. MAPK and Akt activities were measured using MAPK
activity assay kit (Chemicon International) and Akt activity assay kit
(Calbiochem) following the manufacturers’ instructions.
Tumor cell invasion assay. For an in vitro model system for metastasis,
we performed a Matrigel invasion assay by using a Matrigel invasion
chamber from BD Biocoat Cellware (10, 11). MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells were seeded at a density of 1  105 per insert and cultured
overnight. After 16 h of serum starvation, the culture media were changed
to serum-free media containing treatments as indicated. Triplicate wells
were used for each treatment. Cells were treated with human recombinant
leptin and IGF-I at 100 ng/mL, alone and in combination. In other sets
of experiments, cells were treated with either 2.5 Amol/L lapatinib or
2.5 Amol/L erlotinib alone and in combination with leptin and IGF-I.
After 24-h incubation, cells remaining above the insert membrane were
removed by gentle scraping with a sterile cotton swab. Cells that invaded
through the Matrigel to the bottom of the insert were fixed in methanol
for 10 min. After washing in PBS, the cells were stained with H&E. The
insert was subsequently washed in PBS, briefly air-dried, and mounted.
The slides were coded to prevent counting bias, and the number of invaded
cells on representative sections of each membrane was counted under a
light microscope. The number of invaded cells for each experimental
sample represents the average of triplicate wells. All experiments were done
at least thrice.
Migration assay. To perform migration assays (11), cells were plated
into 24-well cell culture plates precoated with human fibronectin (5 Ag/cm2;
Sigma). Cells were allowed to grow in 10% FBS–containing DMEM to
confluence, washed with serum-free medium, and serum starved for 16 h. A
1-mm-wide scratch was made across the cell layer with a sterile pipette tip.
After washing with serum-free medium twice, DMEM containing 10 Ag/mL
human fibronectin was added to replace matrix depleted with the scratch.
Plates were photographed immediately after scratching. Cells were treated
with human recombinant leptin and/or IGF-I at 100 ng/mL. In other sets of
experiments, cells were treated with lapatinib or erlotinib at 2.5 Amol/L
alone and in combination with leptin and IGF-I. Plates were photographed
after 24 h at the identical location of initial image. All experiments were
done at least thrice.
ECIS wound-healing assays. Wound-healing assays were done using the
ECIS (Applied BioPhysics) technology (11). For wound-healing assays, cells
were grown to confluence on ECIS plates and serum starved for 16 h. The
ECIS plates were submitted to an elevated voltage pulse of 40-kHz
frequency, 3.5-V amplitude, and 30-s duration, which led to the death and
detachment of cells present on the small active electrode, resulting in a
wound normally healed by cells surrounding the small active electrode that
have not been submitted to the elevated voltage pulse. Cells were

assessed by continuous resistance measurements for 24 h.

Results
Combined treatment with leptin and IGF-I increases
proliferation as well as migration and invasion of breast
cancer cells. Recently, we and others showed that leptin increases
proliferation and growth of breast cancer cells (refs. 10–12;
reviewed in ref. 13). IGF-I is a known mitogen whose overexpression promotes tumor growth (18–21). It is suggested that IGF-I can
act in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine fashion to regulate cell
growth, survival, and differentiation and can synergize with other
growth factors to produce enhanced mitogenic effects (19). We
examined the effect of cotreatment of leptin and IGF-I on breast
cancer cell proliferation using an anchorage-dependent cell proliferation assay. We found that cotreatment with leptin and IGF-I
significantly increases proliferation of breast cancer cells in comparison with either treatment alone (Fig. 1A). Generally, IGF-I does
not stimulate growth in estrogen receptor–negative cell lines;
however, many estrogen receptor–negative cell lines depend on
IGF-IR for tumorigenesis and metastasis (17, 28). We observed
that IGF-I stimulated growth in estrogen receptor–negative breast
cancer cells, albeit the level of stimulation was lesser than that
in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cells. Cancer progression is a multistep process that involves invasion of basement
membrane by tumor cells and migration to points far from a given
primary tumor mass leading to metastasis. We also examined the
effect of combined treatment of leptin and IGF-I on invasion and
migration properties of breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1B
and C, breast cancer cells treated with both leptin and IGF-I
exhibited significantly increased invasion and migration potential
as compared with cells treated with either agent alone.
Crosstalk between leptin and IGF-I signaling involves
association between leptin receptor and IGF-IR in breast
cancer cells. Binding of leptin to leptin receptor (Ob-Rb)
phosphorylates conserved tyrosine residues at Y985, Y1077, and
Y1138 (29). These phosphorylation events are important for
subsequent signaling events including Janus-activated kinase
(JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
activation (29). We first examined the effect of leptin and IGF-I
on phosphorylation of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) in breast cancer
cells and found that leptin treatment increased the phosphorylation of Ob-Rb in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells as
shown by immunoprecipitation of Ob-Rb followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Interestingly, IGF-I
treatment also resulted in Ob-Rb phosphorylation albeit a little less

robust than leptin treatment. However, the combined treatment
resulted in synergistic increase in Ob-Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 2A).
Binding of IGF-I leads to activation of IGF-IR initiating autophosphorylation of the receptor at tyrosine residues 1131, 1135, and
1136 (30). We found that IGF-I treatment initiated tyrosine
phosphorylation at IGF-IR in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and
MCF-7 cells as expected. Intriguingly, displaying a bidirectional
crosstalk with IGF-I signaling, leptin treatment increased phosphorylation of IGF-IR and combined treatment led to a synergistic
increase in phosphorylation of IGF-IR (Fig. 2B). Immunoblots were
reprobed with antibodies against Ob-Rb and IGF-IR to show that
the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation at receptors was not due
to any change in the level of immunoprecipitated protein.
Phosphorylated tyrosine bands shown in all cases correspond to
the expected size band (Ob-Rb and IGF-IR). Next, we examined
if IGF-IR and Ob-Rb interact in the presence of leptin and IGF-I.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that IGF-IR coimmunoprecipitated with Ob-Rb in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and
MCF-7 cells treated with leptin and IGF-I. Conversely, Ob-Rb was
detected in IGF-IR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C). Interestingly,
no association of Ob-Rb and IGF-IR was observed in the absence
of ligands.
Downstream signaling of leptin and IGF-I involves activation
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MAPK signaling (29, 30).
We next examined if leptin and IGF-I can coactivate these downstream signaling molecules. Leptin treatment led to increased
phosphorylation of Ser473 on Akt (Fig. 3A) and Thr202 and Tyr204 on
p42 ERK and p44 ERK (Fig. 3B) in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231,
and MCF-7 cells. IGF-I treatment also increased phosphorylation
of Akt and ERK when compared with untreated control cells.
Interestingly, combined treatment of leptin and IGF-I induced a
robust increase in phosphorylation of Akt and ERK. Leptin and
IGF-I treatment had no effect on total ERK and Akt protein
expression levels (Fig. 3A and B). Together, these data suggest that
a bidirectional crosstalk occurs between leptin and IGF-I signaling involving association of Ob-Rb and IGF-IR and activation of
downstream signaling molecules.
Synergistic effect of leptin and IGF-I requires transactivation of EGFR in breast cancer cells. Transactivation of EGFR
in response to activation of G-protein–coupled receptors, IGF-I,
E-cadherin, and integrins can have important physiologic consequences (31–33). Increased phosphorylation of EGFR in response
to leptin was recently reported in human gastric cancer cells
(25). Treatment of breast cancer cells with either leptin or IGF-I
resulted in increased phosphorylation of EGFR, as shown by
immunoprecipitation of EGFR followed by immunoblotting with
an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphorylated tyrosine bands

media were replaced with media containing 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, and the combination for 24 h. The plates were photographed at the
identical location of the initial image at 24 h posttreatment. The fold change in migration was calculated. Columns, mean of three independent experiments done

Interestingly, combined treatment with leptin and IGF-I induced

increased phosphorylation of Ob-Rb whereas combined treatment induced further increase in Ob-Rb phosphorylation (A). Increased phosphorylation of IGF-IR was
observed in cells treated with leptin and IGF-I alone, whereas combined treatment induced a synergistic increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation (B ). Phosphorylated

Bidirectional Crosstalk between Leptin and IGF-I

Figure 3. Combined treatment with leptin and IGF-I leads to a synergistic increase in phosphorylation of both Akt and ERK in breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells were serum starved for 24 h, followed by treatment with 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, and the combination for 30 min.
Total protein was isolated from MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with specific
antibodies against phospho-Akt (p-Akt) and Akt (A) or phospho-ERK (p-ERK ) and ERK (B). Increased phosphorylation of Akt was observed in MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells treated with leptin or IGF-I, whereas combined treatment induced further increase in Akt phosphorylation. Leptin and IGF-I treatment
increased phosphorylation of ERK, whereas combined treatment induced a synergistic increase in ERK phosphorylation. The membranes were reblotted with ERK, Akt,
and anti-actin antibodies as control. Representative blots of multiple independent experiments. The representative histogram is the densitometric analysis of the
Western blot signals showing fold increase in levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK with respect to total Akt and ERK. #, P < 0.01, compared with untreated controls;

growth factor precursor pro-HB-EGF in some cells (34). We found
that preincubation of MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells with
MMP inhibitor, GM6001, inhibited leptin- and IGF-I–induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4A).
We next sought to determine the biological importance of the
transactivation of EGFR in the context of synergistic effect of leptin
and IGF-I on breast cancer cell proliferation and activation of
downstream signaling molecules. The biological effect of blocking EGFR with an EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, was studied by cell
proliferation assay. MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells
were pretreated with AG1478 followed by stimulation with leptin
and IGF-I together. Interestingly, pretreatment with AG1478
significantly inhibited the stimulatory effect of leptin and IGF-I
on breast cancer cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1). In

addition, inhibition of EGFR activation using AG1478 inhibited the
synergistic effect of combined treatment of leptin and IGF-I on Akt
and ERK activation (Fig. 4B and C). On activation, IGF-IR further
directly phosphorylates various intracellular substrates such as
IRS-1 and IRS-2 (30). Leptin induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 and
IRS-2 in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, showing further evidence
of crosstalk between leptin and IGF-I signaling. Phosphorylated
tyrosine bands shown in all cases correspond to the expected size
band (IRS-1 and IRS-2). Leptin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1
and IRS-2 could be inhibited by inhibition of EGFR activation.
Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR activation inhibited leptininduced phosphorylation of IRS-2 more efficiently compared with
IRS-1 (Fig. 4D ). IGF-I treatment induced IRS-1 and IRS-2
phosphorylation. Combined treatment of leptin and IGF-I synergistically increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Inhibition

Bidirectional Crosstalk between Leptin and IGF-I

be a valid therapeutic approach to counter the effects of leptin and
IGF-I on breast cancer cells.
Inhibition of EGFR disrupts leptin- and IGF-I–induced
invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Invasion and
metastasis are the key biological features of carcinoma cell
behavior. In addition to examining the effect of EGFR inhibitor
AG1478 on leptin- and IGF-I–induced breast cancer cell
proliferation, we also examined EGFR blockade [using clinically
relevant EGFR inhibitors, lapatinib (26) and erlotinib (27)] as a
potential strategy for inhibiting the synergistic effect of leptin and
IGF-I on invasion and migration. Lapatinib is a small-molecule
inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinase domains that
inhibits baseline and ligand-stimulated activity of EGFR and
HER2 and blocks downstream signaling (26, 35). EGFR inhibitor
erlotinib is currently approved for non–small cell lung cancer,
colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and head and neck cancer (35).
We showed that combined treatment of leptin and IGF-I
significantly increased the invasion potential of breast cancer
cells (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with lapatinib or erlotinib significantly inhibited the combined stimulatory effect of leptin and
IGF-I on MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
invasion potential (Fig. 5).
We next examined the effect of lapatinib and erlotinib treatment
on the combined stimulatory effect of leptin and IGF-I on
migration of breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, combined
treatment with leptin and IGF-I increased the migration of MDAMB-231, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas erlotinib and
lapatinib treatment resulted in significant inhibition. Next,
we performed a quantitative real-time impedance assay using an
ECIS-based technique (11) to follow the migration of MDA-MB-231,
MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 6B and C). MDA-MB-231,
MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with leptin and IGF-I
displayed an increase in resistance, showing increased migration
in comparison with untreated cells, whereas cells treated with both
leptin and IGF-I together rapidly increased to reach the resistance
values of the nonwounded cells at the start of the experiment.
This increase in migration in response to combined treatment of
leptin and IGF-I was inhibited by lapatinib (Fig. 6B) or erlotinib
treatment (Fig. 6C). We found that leptin and IGF-I induced
phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, whereas inhibition of EGFR
activation inhibited phosphorylation of IRS-2 more efficiently
compared with IRS-1 (Fig. 4D). IRS-2 activation plays a critical role
in growth factor–induced migration of breast cancer cells (30);
therefore, EGFR inhibition dramatically inhibited leptin- and

IGF-I–induced migration. These results collectively show that
transactivation of EGFR by IGF-I and leptin is indeed a crucial
component of the signaling machinery used by the leptin receptor
and IGF-IR in promoting invasion and migration of breast cancer cells.

Discussion
The following novel findings are described in this study: (a)
Combined treatment with leptin and IGF-I increases proliferation
of breast cancer cells. (b) Leptin stimulates phosphorylation of
IGF-IR whereas IGF-I increases phosphorylation of Ob-Rb. (c) ObRb and IGF-IR associate in the presence of leptin and IGF-I. (d)
Leptin and IGF-I treatment synergistically induces transactivation
of EGFR via MMP activation. (e) The synergistic effect of leptin and
IGF-I on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells requires
transactivation of EGFR. These results suggest that a bidirectional
crosstalk exists between Ob-Rb and IGF-IR, which involves
transactivation of EGFR, and targeting EGFR may be a suitable
therapeutic strategy for breast cancer progressing in the presence
of leptin and IGF-I.
Interaction between growth factor signaling pathways have
previously been described, such as crosstalk between IGF-I and
EGF (24, 36). Our studies show for the first time that crosstalk occurs between leptin and IGF-I signaling, and importantly,
this is bidirectional. High levels of leptin can influence the IGF-I
signaling cascade, inducing phosphorylation of IGF-IR; similarly,
IGF-I can influence leptin signaling molecules by phosphorylating Ob-Rb. Physical interaction between membrane receptors
such as IGF-IR and HER2 has previously been reported in MCF-7
breast cancer cells (37) and in trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells (24). Interestingly, this interaction was hierarchical
in which IGF-IR directs HER2 phosphorylation and physical
association (24, 37). The association between Ob-Rb and IGF-IR
in breast cancer cells in response to IGF-I and leptin treatment is
the first report of association between Ob-Rb and IGF-IR. Our
studies support the concept that high levels of leptin and IGF-I
associated with obesity can act synergistically to influence breast
cancer cells and increase the negative influence of obesity on breast
carcinogenesis.
Activation of EGFR provides a potent survival signal in many
cell types, and this activation has been seen in response to a variety
of stimulations including IGF-I (24) and leptin (25). It is suggested that a significant component of IGF-IR-mediated survival

and MCF-7 cells were serum starved for 24 h, followed by treatment with 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, and the combination for 30 min. Total protein
was isolated and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody for EGFR. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mouse monoclonal antibody against phospho-tyrosine. Phosphorylated tyrosine bands shown in all cases correspond
to the expected size band (EGFR). Leptin and IGF-I treatment induced a little increase in phosphorylation of EGFR, whereas combined treatment with leptin
and IGF-I induced a synergistic increase in EGFR phosphorylation. The membranes were reblotted with anti-EGFR antibody as control. Leptin and IGF-I require
MMP activation for EGFR transactivation. MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells were serum starved for 24 h, pretreated with 10 to 100 Amol/L of GM6001 or an equal
volume of vehicle (DMSO) for 30 min, and stimulated with combined treatment of 100 ng/mL leptin and IGF-I for 30 min. Total cell lysates were isolated and
immunoprecipitated with EGFR; immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The membranes were reblotted with anti-EGFR antibody
as control. Pretreatment with GM6001 inhibited leptin- and IGF-I–induced EGFR phosphorylation, indicating the requirement of MMP activation. B to D, EGFR
inhibition inhibits leptin- and IGF-I–induced Akt and ERK activation and inhibits leptin-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 activation. MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7
cells were serum starved for 24 h, followed by treatment with 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, and the combination. Cells were pretreated with 250 nmol/L
AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor) for 45 min, followed by leptin and/or IGF-I treatment as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared; Akt and ERK were immunoprecipitated
with anti-Akt and anti-ERK antibodies and subjected to Akt and ERK activity assay as detailed in Materials and Methods. Pretreatment with AG1478 inhibits
Akt and ERK stimulation in response to combined treatment with leptin and IGF-I. Columns, mean of three independent experiments done in triplicates; bars, SE.

invasion of breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 (A ) and MDA-MB-468 (B ) cells
were cultured in Matrigel invasion chambers and serum starved for 24 h, followed
by treatment with 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, leptin + IGF-I, leptin +

signaling in epithelial cells occurs through transactivation of
EGFR (37). Recently, transactivation of EGFR was found to be
involved in leptin-mediated activation of JAK2 and ERK1/2 in
human gastric cancer cells (25). We found that leptin and IGF-I
synergistically increased the activation of EGFR in breast cancer
cells. Importantly, we found that inhibition of EGFR activation
using EGFR inhibitor AG1478 inhibits leptin- and IGF-I–induced
activation of downstream signaling molecules as well as the
biological actions of leptin and IGF-I. These results show that
EGFR transactivation is an important step in the leptin and IGF-I
crosstalk in breast cancer cells, which can be potentially used for
clinical intervention.
Targeted therapies against EGFR have been quite disappointing
(38–40) in contrast to targeted therapies against the HER2/neu
receptor, which have been very effective against breast tumors
exhibiting HER2 gene amplification (41, 42). It is important to note

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

that, thus far, EGFR-targeted therapies have been used indiscriminately against all subtypes of breast carcinoma, perhaps
missing a subtype that might benefit more from this treatment.
The molecular classification of breast cancer has been recently
redefined by gene microarray analysis, which identified distinct
subtypes of breast cancer. These subtypes display distinct gene
expression signatures and clinical outcomes (43–45). A high percentage of triple-negative (lacking expression of estrogen receptor
and progesterone receptor and lacking overexpression of HER2)
breast tumors were found to express EGFR, raising the possibility
that this subgroup can benefit from EGFR-targeted therapy (46, 47).
The dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib has been shown to
inhibit HER2 and EGFR signaling and to block the signal
transduction effects of HER-family ligands transforming growth
factor a, heregulin, and EGF (26, 35). Erlotinib was shown to exhibit
greater growth inhibition in high-HER2-expressing than in lowHER2-expressing breast cancer cells (27). We show here for the first
time that lapatinib and erlotinib successfully inhibit invasion and
migration of triple-negative cells induced by combined treatment
of leptin and IGF-I.
Our results become more important in light of the recent
epidemiologic studies showing (a) the high prevalence of triplenegative breast cancer in African American women (48), and (b)
that African American breast cancer patients are more likely to
have advanced disease at diagnosis, higher risk of recurrence, more
aggressive tumor, and poorer overall prognosis in comparison with
White American women (49). Epidemiologic studies indicate that
these differences can be partly explained by the fact that African
American women more frequently exhibit endocrine and metabolic
changes associated with upper body obesity. These changes include
high levels of leptin and IGF-I and perturbations of other
components associated with metabolic syndrome (reviewed in
ref. 49). Taken together, these studies indicate that obese women
with triple-negative breast cancers may have the worst prognosis of
any subtype of breast cancer. We found that the novel bidirectional
crosstalk between leptin and IGF-I signaling augments triplenegative breast cancer cell migration and invasion potential. It is
important to note that triple-negative breast cancers are not only
highly aggressive and highly proliferative cancers but they also they
have the worst clinical prognosis, partly due to the lack of targeted
therapy. Our study show that triple-negative and hormone-positive
breast cancer can be effectively targeted with EGFR inhibitors, and
these inhibitors can neutralize the procancerous effects of leptin
and IGF-I.

Figure 6. Inhibition of EGFR with lapatinib and erlotinib inhibits leptin- and IGF-I–induced increased migration of breast cancer cells. A, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated surface, serum starved for 24 h, and scratched with a pipette tip. The plates were
photographed immediately following scratching. Culture media were replaced with media containing 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, leptin + IGF-I, leptin +
IGF-I + 2.5 Amol/L lapatinib, and leptin + IGF-I + 2.5 Amol/L erlotinib for 24 h. The plates were photographed at the identical location of the initial image at 24
h posttreatment. The fold change in migration was calculated. Columns, mean of three independent experiments done in triplicates; bars, SE. *, P < 0.005, compared
with leptin + IGF-I–treated cells; #, P < 0.001, compared with leptin + IGF-I–treated cells. B and C, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells were grown to
confluence in ECIS plates, serum starved for 16 h, and subjected to an elevated voltage pulse of 40-kHz frequency at 3.5-V amplitude for 30 s to incite a wound.
The cells were immediately treated with 100 ng/mL leptin, 100 ng/mL IGF-I alone, leptin + IGF-I, leptin + IGF-I + 2.5 Amol/L lapatinib, and leptin + IGF-I + 2.5 Amol/L
erlotinib. The wound was then allowed to be healed by cells surrounding the small active electrode that did not undergo the elevated voltage pulse. Resistance
was measured before and after the elevated voltage pulse application as described in Materials and Methods. The measurements were stopped 24 h after the creation
of wound. All the experiments were done thrice in triplicates.
