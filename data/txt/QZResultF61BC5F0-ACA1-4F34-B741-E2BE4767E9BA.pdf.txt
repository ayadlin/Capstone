ABSTRACT:
At high cytotoxic concentrations, actinomycin D (ActD) blocks transcription,
decreasing levels of MDM2 and thus causing p53 stabilization. At low cytostatic
concentrations, ActD causes ribosomal stress, which decreases MDM2 activity,
resulting in p53 stabilization and activation. ActD can thus be used for p53-based
cyclotherapy. We analyzed pathways mediating ActD-induced p53 expression.
Inhibitors (LY294002, wortmannin, and deguelin) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases
(PI3K) and AKT, but not inhibitors of MEK1/2, JNK, and p38-MAPK abolished the
ActD-induced p53 expression in diverse cell types. RNA interference further supported
these results. When AKT was downregulated by small hairpin RNA-AKTs, ActD-induced
p53 expression was significantly decreased. ActD caused AKT phosphorylation at
Ser473, indicating full activation of AKT. The potential for cancer therapy is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

duplexes via deoxyguanosine residues, resulting in the
inhibition of RNA synthesis by blocking the elongation of
RNA chains [12].
The application of ActD at high doses (> 800 nM)
is limited due to its high toxicity through acting as a
transcription blocker; however at low doses (10-100 nM) it
induces p53 expression and is not highly toxic [13, 14]. In
addition, at a high cytotoxic concentration (50 nM), ActD
has been shown to block transcription and decrease levels
of HDM2 thereby stabilizing p53 [15]. Further, at a low
cytostatic concentration (2 nM), ActD causes ribosomal
stress leading to a decrease in HDM2 activity and thereby
p53 stabilization and activation. Therefore, combined
treatment of low-dose ActD with other chemotherapeutic
drugs may be a promising cancer therapy. The combined
treatment of ActD with leptomycin B, a small molecule
nuclear export inhibitor, has been shown to successfully
lead to the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53
in the nuclei of human papillomavirus positive cervical
carcinoma cells, resulting in apoptosis of the cells [16].
Due to the inhibition of RNA transcription, ActD has been
found to have antineoplastic properties in the treatment
of various malignant neoplasms including Wilm’s tumour
[14]. In addition, ActD has been shown to mimic nutlin-3
in the activation of p53-dependent transcription, induction
of a reversible protective growth arrest in normal cells,

In response to cellular stress such as DNA damage,
oncogene activation, transcriptional inhibition, and
hypoxia, tumor suppressor p53 is activated and expressed,
and acts as a transcription factor to induce its target genes
[1], thereby playing a central role in the regulation of DNA
repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence, and angiogenesis
[2-4]. Its major target genes include proapoptotic genes
Bax, Puma and Noxa, cell cycle regulator p21, and the
senescence-inducing gene Plasminogen activator inhibitor
1 [5]. The restriction of cellular growth by p53 has been
reported to result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [6],
and targeting p53 and restoring p53 function to limit
tumor growth has been intensively researched for cancer
therapy [7]. AKT is a well-known survival factor that
phosphorylates and activates oncoprotein HDM2 (also
known as murine double minute 2 (MDM2), HDM2 in
humans), and in turn, HDM2 induces degradation of p53
[8, 9]. Thus AKT indirectly downregulates p53, and p53
negatively regulates AKT [10].
Actinomycin D (ActD), an antineoplastic antibiotic
isolated from Streptomyces sp., has been reported to
induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and inhibit growth
of pancreatic cancer cells [11]. ActD inhibits cell
proliferation by forming a stable complex with DNA

and enhancement of the activity of the chemotherapeutic
drugs, melphalan and etoposide, resulting in apoptosis of
p53 positive human tumor cells [14].
Although low doses of ActD have been studied in
p53 base cyclotherapy, the kinase pathway by which ActD
induces p53 has not been examined. Cyclotherapy may be
achieved by combining ActD treatment with other drugs
[17, 18], and therefore understanding the cellular kinase
pathway for the drugs used in combination treatment will
be valuable for future cyclotherapy studies. The present
study analyzed the kinase pathway through which ActD
induces p53, and found that AKT was phosphorylated and
activated by ActD. AKT is required in mediating ActDinduced p53 expression. Thus, there is a novel function
of ActD in the upregulation of AKT-mediated p53
expression. This study clarifies the signaling pathway that
induces p53 via ActD, a potential chemotherapeutic agent.

p53 for up to 30 h in the 293 and 293T cells (Fig. 1A). In
contrast, treatment with ActD (10 nM) distinctly induced
the expression and phosphorylation of p53 at 3 h, reaching
a maximal response at 6 h, and maintaining a high level of
p53 for up to 12 h in the HepG2 cells. In the Hepa-1c1c7
cells, treatment with ActD (10 nM) distinctly induced the
expression and phosphorylation of p53 at 6 h, and a high
level of p53 was maintained for up to 12 h (Fig. 1A). In
the dosage studies, the expression and phosphorylation
of p53 reached a maximal level with treatment of 10 nM
ActD for 24 h in the 293 and 293T cells (Fig. 1B). In the
HepG2 cells, the expression of p53 reached a maximal
level with treatment of 10 nM ActD, and decreased with
doses of 100 nM or higher for 6 h (Fig. 1B). Although
p53 protein levels decreased after reaching the maximal
level with treatment of 30 nM ActD, phosphorylation of
p53 still increased with treatment of high doses (100 and
300 nM) of ActD. In the Hepa1c1c7 cells, the expression
of p53 reached a maximal level with treatment of 100 nM
ActD, and decreased with a dose of 300 nM for 6 h (Fig.
1B). Although p53 protein levels decreased after reaching
the maximal level with treatment of 100 nM ActD,
phosphorylation of p53 still increased with treatment of a
high dose (300 nM) of ActD.
When the expression and phosphorylation patterns
of HDM2 were examined, the results showed that HDM2
expression was induced by low doses of ActD (5 or 10
nM), and suppressed by high doses (> 10 nM) of ActD

cells were then harvested, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against p53, phospho-p53 (Ser15), HDM2,
phosphor-HDM2 (Ser166), GAPDH, and β-actin.

The PI3K-AKT pathway mediates ActD-induced
p53 expression

(Fig. 1A). In contrast, p53 expression was still induced
at higher doses of ActD (>10 nM). The phosphorylation
patterns of HDM2 were similar to the protein expression
patterns of HDM2.

We were interested in analyzing whether any kinase
pathway mediated ActD-induced p53 expression and
phosphorylation. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
inhibitors (LY294002 (10 μM) and wortmannin (10 μM))

ActD stimulates p53 activity
A reporter plasmid, p53-TA-Luc, was used to
quantify p53 activity. The p53 activity in the 293 and
293T cells increased from 12 through 24 h after treatment
with 10 nM ActD (Fig. 2). The increase in the p53 activity
in the HepG2 cells was also time course-dependent and
reached a plateau at 12 h after treatment with 10 nM ActD.

with PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 (10 μM) or wortmannin (10

treatment with ActD for 24 h in 293 and 293T cells, and for 6 h
in HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7 cells. (B) Cells were pretreated with
deguelin, (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 μM) for 1 h, followed

6 h in HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7 cells. (C) The MEK1/2 inhibitor
(PD98059, 10 μM), JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 50 μM), and p38
inhibitor (SB203580, 25 μM) were applied. Cells were pretreated
with kinase inhibitors for 1 h, followed by treatment with ActD
for 24 h in 293 and 293T cells, and for 6 h in HepG2 and Hepa1c1c7 cells. (D) Cells were treated individually with ActD (10

cells), PD98059 (10 μM), SP600125 (50 μM), and SB203580
(25 μM) for 24 h in 293 and 293T cells, and for 6 h in HepG2 and
Hepa-1c1c7 cells. The cells were then harvested and cell lysates
were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against p53,
phospho-p53 (Ser15), GAPDH, and β-actin.

and an AKT inhibitor (deguelin (0.1 or 0.2 μM)) were
added to the 293, 293T, HepG2, and Hepa-1c1c7 cells
that had been treated with ActD. All of these inhibitors

either abolished or highly decreased the ActD-induced
p53 expression (Fig. 3A). Deguelin dose-dependently
suppressed p53 expression, and 0.05 μM deguelin
decreased the p53 expression in the 293, 293T and HepG2
cells (Fig. 3B). However, 0.2 μM deguelin was required
to cause a distinct decrease in p53 expression in the
Hepa-1c1c7 cells. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs), including MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059)
and Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor (SP600125),
did not suppress the ActD-induced p53 expression
or phosphorylation (ser15) (Fig. 3C). p38 inhibitor
(SB203580) caused a minor reduction in the ActD-induced
increase in the expression and phosphorylation of p53 in
the 293T and Hepa-1c1c7 cells, but not in the 293 and
HepG2 cells. The different results for the p38 inhibitor
may be due to cell-specific and species-specific factors.
None of the applied kinase inhibitors themselves distinctly
induced p53 expression (Fig. 3D).
In order to further confirm the results of Western
blotting, the expression of p53 was further examined by

h in HepG2 cells. (C) Cells were pretreated with AKT inhibitor
(deguelin, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 μM) for 1 h, followed by

with ethanol. The expression of the p53 protein was probed using
an antibody against p53, as revealed by fluorescence of goat
polyclonal secondary antibody to mouse IgG-H&L (DyLight®
488). The fluorescence emitted by the cells was viewed using a
fluorescence microscope, equipped with U-MWB2 optical filters
at excitation/emission wavelengths of 460~490/520 nm. Nuclei
were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) and observed by a
fluorescence microscope equipped with U-MWU optical filters
with a U-MWU optical filter at an excitation wavelength of 355
nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm. The morphologies of
the cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy.

immunofluorescence staining. The HepG2 cells were
treated with ActD for 6 h, and the p53 expression level
was examined by immunofluorescence imaging. The
benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-induced p53 expression was used as
a positive control, and the blue fluorescence dye, Hoechst
33342, revealed the location of the nuclei. Fluorescence
was dose-dependently increased by treatment with ActD
(3-30 nM), but decreased by treatment with 100 nM ActD
(Fig. 4A). These results were similar to those derived from
Western blotting (Fig. 1B). PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 (10
μM) and wortmannin (10 μM)), but not MEK1/2 inhibitor
(PD98059), JNK inhibitor (SP600125), or p38 MAPK
inhibitor (SB203580), inhibited the ActD-induced p53
expression in the immunofluorescence assays (Fig. 4B).
A dose of 50 nM and higher of deguelin suppressed the
ActD-induced p53 expression in the immunofluorescence
assays (Fig. 4C). These results were also similar to those
derived from Western blotting (Fig. 3B and C). When the
cells were treated with each kinase inhibitor individually,
the applied kinase inhibitors themselves caused a minor
induction of p53 expression (Fig. 5).

To determine whether AKT was needed in the
ActD induction of p53 expression, shRNAs for AKT1
were introduced into the HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7 cells by
lentiviruses to knock down AKT levels. Lentiviruses were
used to individually produce the shRNAs of the green
fluorescence protein (GFP), firefly luciferase (LUC), three
different shRNAs of human AKT1 (AKT1-a, -b, and -c),
and two different shRNAs of mouse Akt1 (Akt1-1 and -2)
in the virus-infected cells. Viruses with shRNA-LUC and
shRNA-GFP were used as the controls of viral infection.
The relative AKT and p53 protein levels in the
cells with and without shRNA-LUC, shRNA-GFP, and
shRNA-AKT1, were demonstrated by Western blotting.
There was no significant difference in AKT protein level
between the cells without shRNA and those with shRNALUC or shRNA-GFP (Fig. 6A and B). Only 10-20% and
10-30% of AKT was left in HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7 cells
with shRNA-AKT, respectively.
ActD (30 nM) highly induced p53 protein in the
cells without shRNA and in the cells with shRNA-LUC
and shRNA-GFP (Fig. 6A and B). In contrast, the ActD-

induced p53 protein levels in the HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7
cells with shRNA-AKT were only 8-11% and 40%,
respectively, of that in the cells without shRNA (Fig. 6A
and B).

Phosphorylation of AKT decreased after treatment with
ActD for 10 minutes in the 293, 293T, and Hepa-1c1c7
cells, but still increased after treatment with ActD (10 and
30 nM) for 10 minutes in the HepG2 cells.

ActD induces phosphorylation of AKT

ActD decreases cell viability

In order to further identify whether the ActDinduced p53 expression was mediated by the AKT
pathway, phosphorylation at serine 473 of AKT was
analyzed. Treatment with 10 nM ActD for 2 and 6
minutes distinctly phosphorylated AKT at serine 473 in
the HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7 cells, however 30 and 100
nM ActD was required for distinct phosphorylation of
AKT in the 293 and 293T cells, respectively (Fig. 7).

A cell viability assay was then performed. Treatment
with ActD at low doses of 3-30 nM for the 293 and 293T
cells, and 3-100 nM for the HepG2 cells, for 24 and 48
hours dose-dependently decreased cell viability (Fig. 8).
However, treatment with ActD of 30-300 nM for the 293
and 293T cells, and 100 and 300 nM for the HepG2 cells,
for 24 and 48 hours significantly decreased cell viability
by a similar level.

DISCUSSION
A high dose of ActD has been reported to cause
DNA damage and suppress transcription from all three
classes of RNA polymerases, and ActD at a low dose has
been reported to selectively block RNA poly I-dependent
transcription [19]. However, ActD has been shown to
induce p53 expression through ribosomal stress [15, 20].
It has also been reported that the ribosomal protein L11
interacts with oncoprotein HDM2 and inhibits the function
of HDM2, thus leading to the stabilization and activation
of p53 [20-22]. In addition, the interaction of L11 with
HDM2 has been shown to be enhanced in response to
ActD [19, 21]. ActD at a low dose has been reported to
induce p53, and in turn, p53 increase the expression of
HDM2 [15]. HDM2 has been shown to be transcribed by
p53, which forms a negative feedback loop to promote
poly-ubiquitination and degradation of p53 [23]. Although
HDM2 is induced indirectly by ActD, ActD also induces
the interaction of L11 with HDM2 leading to inhibition of
HDM2 function. Therefore p53 induced by ActD is more
stable than that induced by other drugs without inhibiting
HDM2 function. Accordingly, it is worth exploring the
role of ActD as a p53 activator to reduce the growth of
tumors.
Although it has been reported that ActD induces
p53 expression, the kinase pathway for ActD-induced p53
has not been identified. Our results showed that inhibitors
of PI3K and AKT, but not inhibitors of MEK1/2, JNK or
p38, abolished ActD-induced p53 expression. MEK1/2 is
immediately upstream of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) 1/2, and has been reported to activate
ERK1/2 [24]. When a MEK1/2 inhibitor was applied,
ERK1/2 activity was also inhibited. These kinase inhibitors
of MEK1/2, JNK or p38 themselves did not distinctly
induce p53 expression. The Western blotting results were
further confirmed by in situ immunofluorescence staining.
Phosphorylation of Ser15 in p53 is a sign that p53 is
activated [25]. It has been shown that the MAP kinases

including JNKs, ERKs, and p38 phosphorylate p53 in
response to different stressful stimuli, and in turn, activate
a p53 response leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
[24]. In addition, Ser15 of p53 has been shown to be
phosphorylated by JNKs, ERKs, and p38 [24]. However,
the ActD-induced phosphorylation (Ser15) of p53 was not
inhibited by the inhibitors of p38, JNKs and ERKs in the
current study, indicating that the phosphorylation (Ser15)
of p53 was independent of these three MAP kinases.
Serine/threonine kinase AKT is a downstream
kinase of PI3K and a critical PI3K effector [26]. AKT is
recruited to plasma membranes by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3),
and AKT is then phosphorylated on Thr-308 and Ser473
by PDK1 and mTORC2-Rictor, respectively. Upon Ser473
phosphorylation by mTORC2, AKT is fully activated [27].
Our results showed that ActD induced the phosphorylation
of AKT at Ser473 within 2 minutes. In addition to PI3K
inhibitors, deguelin, an AKT inhibitor, suppressed ActDinduced p53 expression in a dose-dependent manner. This
confirms that ActD-induced p53 expression is mediated
by the activation of AKT. Finally, the necessity of AKT in
mediating ActD-induced p53 expression was confirmed by
RNA interference on AKT. ActD-induced p53-expression
significantly decreased when AKT expression was
knocked-down by shRNA. Although AKT has been shown
to downregulate p53 [28], the findings in the current study
reveal a new function of AKT in the upregulation of p53.
PI3K-AKT signaling has been reported to
promote the activation of the oncoprotein HDM2 and
to downregulate the p53 tumor suppressor [28], and
therefore AKT is defined as a survival factor. In contrast,
AKT has been shown to be downregulated by p53 [10,
29]. However, our results showed that treatment with
ActD immediately activated AKT signaling, and thereby
induced p53 expression.
MAPKs have been widely reported to be involved
in the activation of p53. The p38-mediated p53
phosphorylation at Ser15 and subsequent p53 induction
has been reported to be responsible for apoptosis induced
by nitric oxide, hypoxic conditions, DNA-damaging
agents, 1-nitropyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene [30-32]. In
response to oxidative stress, JNKs have been shown to
phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 [33], and ERKs have been
shown to mediate the p53 activation induced by colcemid
and resveratrol [34, 35]. AKT is a central point in cell
signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and
other cellular stimuli, and thus it acts as a key regulator
of a wide range of cellular processes including growth,
proliferation and survival [9]. Therefore, AKT is best
known for promoting cell survival and growth. In contrast
to MAPKs, AKT inhibits the expression and function of
apoptotic proteins, BAD and caspase-9, and promotes the
activity of HDM2 which degrades p53 [9]. It has been
reported that AKT and p53 counteract each other [3642]. In contrast, the results of the current study showed
that AKT, but not MAPKs, mediated ActD-induced p53

expression and activation.
With regards to the induction of p53, the p53
protein expression peaked at 24 h, 24 h, 6 h, and 6 h with
10 nM, 10 nM , 10, and 100 nM ActD treatment in the
293, 293T, HepG2, and Hepa-1c1c7 cells, respectively.
Upon longer periods and higher doses of ActD the p53
expression decreased, which may be due to suppression of
transcription from all three classes of RNA polymerases.
Activated p53, a sequence-specific transcription factor, has
been reported to bind to the p53RE on p53-targeted genes
such as p21, to direct its downstream signals and actions
[43]. In the current study, ActD also showed a time coursedependent increase in p53 activity, assayed by measuring
the transcriptional activity of a p53RE reporter plasmid.
Interestingly, ActD-induction of p53 expression was much
faster in liver cells than in kidney cells.
HDM2 was transcribed by the p53 transcription
factor, and the patterns of expression and phosphorylation
of HDM2 were parallel to those of p53 at low doses (5 or
10 nM) of ActD treatment. However, p53, but not HDM2
expression was still induced by high doses (> 10 nM) of
ActD treatment. Further studies are needed to elucidate
the discrepancy between these expression patterns at high
doses of ActD treatment.
ActD (≤ 10 nM) dose-dependently decreased cell
viability, and its induction of active p53 also peaked at
10 nM in the 293 and 293T cells. High doses (≥ 30 nM)
of ActD did not further decrease cell viability or increase
p53 expression. In contrast, ActD (≤ 100 nM) dosedependently decreased cell viability and increased active
p53 in the HepG2 cells. Therefore, the results of the cell
viability assay reflected the activation of p53.
It has been reported that the activation of AKT
involves ionizing radiation induction of p53 [44].
Constitutively expressed active myristoylated AKT has
been reported to increase p53 levels [45]. However, ActD
is the first chemical compound that has been shown to date
to induce the AKT-mediated p53 expression.
An ideal chemotherapeutic agent is expected to
specifically kill tumor cells, cause the least amount of
undesirable side effect, and leave normal cells unharmed.
However, the specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs towards cancer cells is limited. Cyclotherapy is a
prospective therapeutic strategy for the protection of
normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy [17].
The idea of p53-based cyclotherapy is that a p53 activator
ceases proliferation in normal tissues while leaving the
p53-deficient tumor susceptible to the toxicity of S- or
M-phase chemotherapeutic poisons [18]. In addition, the
p53 activator does not affect the sensitivity of tumor cells
to the chemotherapeutic agents.
ActD has been shown to have a reversible cytostatic
effect and the ability to arrest cells in both the G1 and
G2 phase of the cell cycle [17]. A low, non-genotoxic,
dose (about 1 nM) of ActD has been shown to induce a
reversible cytostatic effect in normal proliferating dermal

fibroblasts and protect them from the aneuploidy induced
by the aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and the toxic effects
of gemcitabine [46, 47]. In contrast, pretreatment of ActD
did not weaken the growth inhibitory effects of VX-680 in
clonogenic assays [46] and did not affect the sensitivity of
the tumor cells to gemcitabine [47].
ActD is a classic clinically approved drug [46].
Based on studies on ActD, about 1-4 nM of ActD is
suggested for cyclotherapy [18, 46, 47], and 3 nM or
higher may be appropriate for chemotherapy.
In summary, our findings showed that ActD
induces the phosphorylation of AKT, thereby activating
AKT. In turn, AKT signaling is essential in mediating
ActD-induced p53 expression. The expression and
phosphorylation (Ser15) of p53 is independent of JNKs,
ERKs, and p38. Thus, upon activation by ActD, AKT
becomes an inducer of p53 tumor suppression instead of
being a survival factor, as consistently shown in human
embryonic kidney cell lines (293 and 293T), human
hepatoma cell line (HepG2), and mouse hepatoma cell line
(Hepa-1c1c7). These findings on ActD signaling to induce
p53 may be valuable for the development of treatment for
human tumors.

293 is a human embryonic kidney cell line, and
293T is a derivative of 293 cells with an expression of
SV40 T antigen. HepG2 is a human hepatoma cell line,
and Hepa-1c1c7 is a mouse hepatoma cell line. The 293
and Hepa-1c1c7 cells were maintained in MEMα, and the
HepG2 cells in MEM plus 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2
mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin. The 293T cells were maintained in DMEM/
F12 plus 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
The cultured cells were kept at 37°C in a 95% air/5%
CO2 environment. The agents were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO).

Plasmid construction and reporter activity assay
p53-TA-Luc contains a p53 response element
(p53RE), located upstream of the minimal TA promoter
(Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The other reporter (RSVlacZ) expresses a lacZ gene-encoded β-galactosidase,
driven by a Rouse sarcoma virus long terminal repeat
(LTR). Luciferase activity indicates transcriptional activity
of the p53RE, and β-galactosidase activity of RSV-lacZ
was used to normalize the luciferase activity. For DNA
transfection, the HepG2, 293, and 293T cells were seeded
respectively at 2 × 105, 2 × 105, and 1 × 105 cells/well
in 24-well plates overnight, and then the p53-TA-Luc
luciferase reporter plasmid and RSV-lacZ plasmids were
transiently transfected into the cells using NTRII for 6
h, followed by treatment with the test compounds. Cell
lysates were collected at the appropriate time points after
treatment with the test compounds and were assayed
for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using
Britelite (PerkinElmer) and a Galacto-Star™ System
(Tropix, Bedford, MA), respectively, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunofluorescence staining

Determination of cell viability by MTT assay

To detect the expression of p53, the HepG2 cells
were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well on microscope cover
glasses in 6-well plates overnight before being treated
with the drugs for the appropriate time periods, followed
by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and fixing
with ethanol. The expression of the p53 protein was
probed using an antibody against p53, as revealed by
fluorescence of a goat polyclonal secondary antibody
to mouse IgG-H&L (DyLight® 488). The bisbenzimide
dye, Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml), was then added to stain
the chromosomes and reveal the location of the nuclei,
and Fluoromount-G was added to reduce fluorochrome
quenching during analysis of the slides by fluorescence
microscopy. Fluorescence emitted by DyLight® 488
was viewed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan), equipped with U-MWB2 optical filters at
excitation/emission wavelengths of 460-490/520 nm. The
fluorescence emitted by Hoechst 33342 was viewed using
a fluorescence microscope, equipped with U-MWU optical
filters at excitation/emission wavelengths of 330-385/420
nm.

HepG2, 293, and 293T cells were seeded in
96-well plates at 4 x 103, 1 x 104, and 1 x 104 cells,
respectively, with 0.1 ml medium. After overnight
culture, they were treated with a range of concentrations
of ActD for 24 and 48 h, followed by incubation with
methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
(Sigma) for the assay. The optical density was detected
at 550 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
plate reader (BIO-TEK, Winooski, VT). Six samples were
assayed for each experiment which was repeated at least
three times.

Statistical analysis
Data are representative of at least three independent
experiments under identical conditions and are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences in the
data of the controls and further treatment with various
compounds were analyzed using the Student’s t-test.
Statistical probability (p) was expressed as * p < 0.05,
*** p < 0.001 and ### p < 0.001. Means were considered
significantly different at p < 0.05.

RNA interference (RNAi)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

To perform RNAi and knock down AKT, 21
nucleotide duplexes corresponding to the human AKT1
mRNA (GenBank: NM_005163) and the mouse Akt1
mRNA (GenBank: NM_009652) were carried individually
by lentiviruses (National RNAi Core Facility, Taipei,
Taiwan). The three nucleotide duplexes for human
AKT1 were AKT1-a (GCATCGCTTCTTTGCCGGTAT,
clone ID: TRCN0000221554), AKT1-b (GATCCTC
AAGAAGGAAGTCAT, clone ID: TRCN0000221553),
and
AKT1-c
(CGCGTGACCATGAACGAGTTT,
clone ID: TRCN0000221555). The two nucleotide
duplexes for mouse Akt1 were Akt1-1 (TCTGAGA
CTGACACCAGGTAT, clone ID: TRCN0000022937)
and Akt1-2 (GCACATCAAGATAACGGACTT, clone ID:
TRCN0000022934).
Nucleotide duplexes for luciferase (LUC;
CAAATCACAGAATCGTCGTAT, clone ID TRC
N0000072246) and green fluorescence protein
(GFP; TATCATGGCCGACAAGCA, clone ID:
TRCN0000072180) were used as controls for viral
infection. HepG2 cells (1.6 × 105 cells/well) and Hepa1c1c7 (1 × 105 cells/well) cells were seeded individually in
6-well plates overnight and then infected by a lentivirus (4
× 105/well) for 24 h. Forty-eight hours after infection, the
HepG2 and Hepa-1c1c7 cells with shRNA were selected
by 2 and 1 µg/ml puromycin, respectively, for 12 h to
obtain stable infectants. The cells were then maintained in
a medium containing puromycin (0.5 µg/ml).
