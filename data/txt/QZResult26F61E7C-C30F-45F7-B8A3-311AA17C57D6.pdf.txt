Abstract
Arsenite is a well-known human carcinogen that especially
targets skin. The tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2) gene
encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is overexpressed in various cancer cells. However, the relevance of
Tpl2 in arsenite-induced carcinogenesis and the underlying
mechanisms remain to be explored. We show that arsenite
increased Tpl2 kinase activity and its phosphorylation in
mouse epidermal JB6 P+ cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. Exposure to arsenite resulted in a marked induction
of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
important mediators of inflammation and tumor promotion.
Treatment with a Tpl2 kinase inhibitor or Tpl2 short hairpin
RNA suppressed COX-2 expression and PGE2 production
induced by arsenite treatment, suggesting that Tpl2 is critical
in arsenite-induced carcinogenesis. We also found that
arsenite-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK) or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases
(JNK) was markedly suppressed by Tpl2 kinase inhibitor or
Tpl2 short hairpin RNA. Inhibition of arsenite-induced ERK or
JNK signaling using a pharmacologic inhibitor of ERK or JNK
substantially blocked COX-2 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of Tpl2 reduced the arsenite-induced promoter activity of
NF-KB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), indicating that NF-KB
and AP-1 are downstream transducers of arsenite-triggered
Tpl2. Our results show that Tpl2 plays a key role in arseniteinduced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production and further
elucidate the role of Tpl2 in arsenite signals that activate
ERK/JNK and NF-KB/AP-1 in JB6 P+ cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Inorganic arsenic, which exists primarily as arsenite (Fig. 1A), is a
well-known human carcinogen in the natural environment. Arsenic
in drinking water is one of the most potent environmental health
threats in the United States and worldwide (1). Chronic intake of
arsenic is associated with an increased risk of tumors of the skin,
bladder, liver, kidney, lung, and other tissues (2). In particular, arsenic
accumulates in the skin and is linked to hyperkeratosis, pigmentation disorders, and skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and
squamous cell carcinoma (3–5). Although evidence of the carcinogenicity of arsenic in humans is strong, the mechanism by which it
produces tumors is not completely understood.

The tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2) proto-oncogene, also known
as Cot or MAP3K8, encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that
is activated by provirus integration in retrovirus-induced T-cell
lymphomas and mammary carcinomas (6–8). Overexpression of
Tpl2 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway (9, 10) as well as various transcription factors (11). The
activation of Tpl2 is required for the induction of tumor necrosis
factor-a by lipopolysaccharide in macrophages (12). Tpl2 is
overexpressed in breast cancer (13) as well as in gastric and colon
adenocarcinomas (14). Therefore, Tpl2 is a critical component of
the signaling pathway that controls tumor development.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme catalyzing the
conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-2 is induced
in many tissues, including the epidermis, in response to
inflammation. Upregulation of COX-2 has been found in the early
stages of carcinogenesis and appears to be a consistent feature of
neoplastic development in a wide variety of human and animal
epithelial tissues (15). Selective COX-2 inhibitors can reduce the
incidence of UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma in hairless mice
(16). COX-2–derived bioactive lipids, including prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), are potent inflammatory mediators that promote tumor
growth and metastasis by stimulating cell proliferation, invasion,
and angiogenesis (17). Elevated PGE2 levels occur in both basal and
squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (18) and are associated with
increased tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, high levels
of prostaglandins may promote the development of malignancy.
Although arsenite induces the expression of COX-2, the precise
mechanism underlying these effects remains to be elucidated.
Here, we focus on determining whether Tpl2 is obligatory for
arsenite-induced signal transduction. We provide evidence that
Tpl2 is a mediator of arsenite-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2
production in mouse epidermal JB6 P+ cells. Furthermore,
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and c-Jun NH2terminal kinases (JNK) are the downstream effectors of Tpl2 for
the mediation of NF-nB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transactivation.

or COX-2 luciferase reporter plasmid and maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS containing 200 g/mL G418. Short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) constructs against Mus musculus Tpl2 were purchased from
Origene. For knockdown experiments, the cells were transfected with
shRNA targeting M. musculus Tpl2 or with nontargeting control shRNA
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s

Western blot assay. For the Western blot assay, cells (1.5  106) were
cultured in a 10-cm dish for 48 h and then starved in 0.1% FBS-MEM for
24 h to eliminate the FBS activation of MAPKs. Following treatment, cells
were disrupted with lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor
cocktail tablet]. The supernatant fractions were boiled for 5 min. The
protein concentration was determined using a dye-binding protein assay
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as described by the manufacturer. Lysate
proteins (30 Ag) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
After blotting, the membrane was incubated at 4jC overnight with the
specific primary antibody. Protein bands were visualized using a
chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after
hybridization with the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody.
Tpl2 immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. JB6 P+ cells were
cultured to 80% confluence and then serum-starved in 0.1% FBS-MEM for
24 h at 37jC. Cells were treated with 20 Amol/L arsenite for different
periods, disrupted with lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 1 mg/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride], and finally centrifuged at 20,000  g for
10 min in a microcentrifuge. The lysates containing 500 Ag protein were
used for immunoprecipitation with an antibody against Tpl2 and then
incubated at 4jC overnight. After the addition of protein A/G Plus agarose
beads, the mixture was continuously rotated at 4jC. The beads were
washed three times with kinase buffer [20 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.2),
25 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and
1 mmol/L DTT], resuspended in 20 AL of 1 kinase buffer supplemented
with 1 Ag inactive MEK1, and ERK2, and incubated for an additional
30 min at 30jC. Next, 20 Ag myelin basic protein and 10 AL diluted
[g-32P]ATP solution were added, and the mixture was incubated for
10 min at 30jC. A 20 AL aliquot was transferred onto p81 paper and washed
three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash followed by a
single wash with acetone for 2 min. The radioactive incorporation was
determined using a scintillation counter. Experiments were done in
triplicate.

amounts of PGE2 released into the medium were measured using the PGE2
enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical). Experiments were done in
triplicate.
Luciferase assay for COX-2, NF-KB, or AP-1 transactivation.
Confluent monolayers of JB6 P+ cells stably transfected with a COX-2,
NF-nB, or AP-1 luciferase plasmid were trypsinized, and 8  103 viable cells
suspended in 100 AL of 5% FBS-MEM were added to each well of a 96-well
plate. Plates were incubated at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
When cells reached 80% to 90% confluence, they were starved by culturing
in 0.1% FBS-MEM for another 24 h. The cells were treated with TKI for
30 min before they were exposed to 20 Amol/L arsenite for 24 h. After
treatment, cells were disrupted with 100 AL lysis buffer [0.1 mol/L
potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L DTT, and
2 mmol/L EDTA], and the luciferase activity was measured using a
luminometer (Luinoskan Ascent, Labsystems).
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean F SD. Student’s t test
was used for single statistical comparisons, with a probability of P < 0.05 as

Role of Tpl2 in Arsenite Carcinogenicity

Results
Arsenite strongly increases phosphorylation and kinase
activity of Tpl2. To determine whether Tpl2 is involved in the
cellular response to arsenite exposure (Fig. 1A), we examined the
phosphorylation of Tpl2 induced by arsenite in mouse epidermal
JB6 P+ cells. Arsenite exposure caused a substantial elevation of
Tpl2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) and kinase activity (Fig. 1C) in a
time-dependent manner and also induced phosphorylation of Tpl2
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that
arsenite induces phosphorylation and kinase activity of Tpl2 in JB6
P+ cells.
Arsenite induces COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion. We
examined whether arsenite could induce COX-2 expression. A timeresponse study indicated that arsenite exposure led to an increase
in COX-2 protein level from 6 to 24 h (Fig. 2A). Arsenite also
increased PGE2 release in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) and
increased COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C).
To further confirm this finding, we measured COX-2 transcription
using a gene reporter assay. The promoter activity of COX-2 was
significantly increased by arsenite exposure dose-dependently
(Fig. 2D). These results indicate that COX-2 expression, COX-2
promoter activity, and PGE2 production are induced by exposure to
arsenite time- and dose-dependently.
TKI suppresses arsenite-induced COX-2 expression. The
above data indicated that arsenite induces Tpl2 kinase activity
and also increases COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion.
Therefore, we hypothesized that Tpl2 might play a key role in
arsenite-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production and that
COX-2 expression would be changed by the inhibition of Tpl2
activation. As expected, we found that TKI, a Tpl2 inhibitor,
markedly suppressed arsenite-induced COX-2 expression in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A). TKI also inhibited arsenite-induced
COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 3B) and substantially attenuated
arsenite-induced PGE2 production (Fig. 3C). These results suggest
that Tpl2 plays a critical role in arsenite-induced COX-2 induction
and PGE2 production.
Involvement of Tpl2 in COX-2 induction by arsenite. We used
shRNA to confirm whether the Tpl2-dependent pathway is involved
in the expression of COX-2 in the arsenite response. The expression
of Tpl2 shRNA specifically reduced the Tpl2 protein level (Fig. 4A,
bottom), and arsenite-induced COX-2 expression was inhibited
in the Tpl2 shRNA cells compared with the control shRNA cells
(Fig. 4A, top). Tpl2 shRNA cells impaired arsenite-induced COX-2
promoter-driven luciferase activity in JB6 P+ cells stably transfected with a COX-2 luciferase plasmid (Fig. 4B). Tpl2 shRNA cells
also significantly inhibited arsenite-induced PGE2 production
(Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results indicate that arsenite induces
COX-2 expression and PGE2 production through a Tpl2-dependent
pathway.
Tpl2 regulates ERK and JNK activity. Previous studies have
indicated that the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in arseniteinduced carcinogenesis in JB6 P+ cells (19, 20). We found that Tpl2
is involved in arsenite-induced COX-2 expression; however, the
signal transduction components mediated by arsenite-induced
Tpl2 activation in JB6 P+ cells are unknown. We hypothesized that
Tpl2 might be located upstream of the known arsenite-stimulated
signal transduction pathway and that Tpl2 could regulate several
downstream kinases. To determine the physiologic role of Tpl2 in
MAPK activation induced by arsenite in JB6 P+ cells, we
investigated the influence of TKI on arsenite-induced activation

treatment with arsenite for 12 h. Finally, we observed that U0126
and SP600125, pharmacologic inhibitors of MEK and JNK,
respectively, blocked arsenite-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 5C).
However, SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, had no effect on arseniteinduced COX-2 expression (data not shown). These findings
indicate that Tpl2 is an upstream kinase of MEK/ERK and
MKK4/JNK and that it is also involved in arsenite-induced COX-2
expression.
Tpl2 regulates NF-KB and AP-1 activity. The COX-2 gene
promoter region contains NF-nB and AP-1 binding sites that can be
recognized by these transcription factors and, in turn, lead to cox-2
gene expression (21). We examined whether NF-nB or AP-1 was a
Tpl2 downstream transcription factor induced by arsenite. To
determine whether the repression of COX-2 expression by TKI
involved the inhibition of NF-nB or AP-1 activation, we measured
NF-nB and AP-1 transactivation using JB6 cells stably transfected
with an AP-1 or NF-nB luciferase reporter plasmid. Pretreatment of
cells with TKI markedly inhibited arsenite-induced NF-nB and AP-1
activation (Fig. 6A and B). A Tpl2 shRNA construct was transfected
into JB6 P+ cells, which were then stably transfected with a NF-nB
or AP-1 luciferase plasmid. Arsenite treatment decreased NF-nB–
and AP-1–dependent transcriptional activity in Tpl2 shRNA cells
compared with control shRNA cells (Fig. 6C and D). These data
show that NF-nB and AP-1 are downstream regulators of Tpl2 for
arsenite-induced COX-2 expression.

Discussion
Arsenite is a well-known skin carcinogen that has the ability to
activate signaling pathways and gene expression. Here, we provide
the first direct evidence that arsenite leads to the activation of Tpl2,
which plays a critical role in arsenite-induced PGE2 production
through the induction of COX-2 expression. Moreover, Tpl2 appears
to function upstream of MEK/ERK and MKK4/JNK, which leads to
induction of cox-2 expression through its downstream NF-nB and
AP-1 signaling pathways. Our data indicate that the activation of
Tpl2 is a major event involved in arsenite-induced carcinogenesis.
The Tpl2 proto-oncogene encodes a serine/threonine protein
kinase that is activated by provirus insertion in T-cell lymphoma
induced by Moloney leukemia virus and mouse mammary tumor
virus–induced mammary carcinomas (6, 7). Investigations of Tpl2
expression in human tumor specimens have shown that Tpl2 is
overexpressed in various cancer cells (13, 14). We recently reported
a link between the phosphorylation of Tpl2 and neoplastic cell
transformation (22). Previous studies have shown that arsenite
induces COX-2 expression, which is mediated through the IKKh/
NF-nB pathway in JB6 P+ cells (23). However, little is known about
the upstream mediators of arsenite-induced COX-2 expression
and PGE2 synthesis. Here, we found that arsenite strongly induces
phosphorylation and kinase activity of Tpl2 (Fig. 1). Accumulating
evidence suggests that oxidative stress occurs in response to
arsenic exposure and may be a factor in dermal arsenic

carcinogenesis (24). Additionally, reactive oxygen species can act as
signaling molecules by activating various cellular processes (25).
Thus, the generation of reactive oxygen species by arsenite may be
associated with various cellular processes, such as Tpl2 activation.
COX-2, a key enzyme in PGE2 synthesis, is maintained at low
levels in normal cells but is induced by inflammatory tumor
promoters, cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes (26). COX-2
knockout mice developed f75% fewer chemically induced skin
papillomas than control mice (27). The present study provides
evidence that arsenite can induce COX-2 expression and PGE2
production in JB6 P+ cells. Arsenite induced COX-2 expression,
COX-2 promoter activity, and PGE2 production in a time- and dosedependent manner. Inhibition of Tpl2 dramatically impaired
arsenite-induced expression of COX-2. Moreover, knockdown of
Tpl2 expression by shRNA abrogated arsenite-induced COX-2
expression and PGE2 generation. These results strongly suggest
that Tpl2 is involved in arsenite-stimulated COX-2 expression and
PGE2 secretion.
Tpl2 is a pivotal member of several intracellular signaling
pathways. Previous studies showed that overexpression of Tpl2
leads to activation of MAPKs (12, 28). Our results show that TKI
significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of the MEK/ERK and
MKK4/JNK signaling pathways, and Tpl2 shRNA reduces arseniteinduced ERK and JNK phosphorylation. The results indicate that

ERK and JNK activation depends on Tpl2. Moreover, U0126 and
SP600125, which are MEK and JNK inhibitors, respectively, strongly
suppressed arsenite-induced COX-2 expression. Overall, these data
suggest that Tpl2 functions upstream of MEK/ERK and MKK4/JNK
and that it is involved in arsenite-induced COX-2 expression.
MAPKs are upstream activators of transcription factors such as
NF-nB and AP-1, which are implicated in COX-2 expression (29, 30).
The cox-2 gene contains binding sites for several important
transcription factors, including NF-nB and AP-1. Increases in
NF-nB-DNA or AP-1-DNA binding immediately precede upregulation
of cox-2 gene transcription in various cell lines. NF-nB was reported
as an upstream mediator of COX-2 expression in mouse epidermal
JB6 P+ cells (23). A correlation between AP-1 and COX-2 expression
has been suggested. AP-1 has been shown to promote tumor-induced
expression of COX-2 in mouse skin (31). We found that arsenite could
induce transactivation of AP-1 in JB6 P+ cells (32). These previous
studies provided strong evidence showing that NF-nB and AP-1 are
involved in arsenite-induced COX-2 expression in JB6 P+ cells.
In the present study, we further examined the arsenite-induced
Tpl2 activity leading to NF-nB and AP-1 transactivation. Pretreatment with TKI significantly reduced arsenite-induced transactivation of NF-nB and AP-1. In Tpl2 shRNA cells, arsenite treatment did
not lead to obvious enhancement of NF-nB or AP-1 transactivation
compared with control shRNA cells. Thus, these data indicate that

Role of Tpl2 in Arsenite Carcinogenicity

Tpl2 is involved in NF-nB and AP-1 arsenite-induced transactivation.
Based on these results, we propose a model for arsenite-induced
Tpl2 activation and the associated signaling pathways. According
to this model, arsenite induces COX-2 expression and PGE2
synthesis, which is mediated by the activation of Tpl2. In addition,
arsenite triggers a Tpl2-dependent MEK/ERK and MKK4/JNK
pathway that leads to the activation of NF-nB and AP-1. These
findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of the
tumor promotion effects of arsenite and suggest that Tpl2 is an
excellent target for the development of drugs to fight arseniteinduced skin carcinogenesis.
