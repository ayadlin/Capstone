Abstract
Breast cancers are composed of molecularly distinct subtypes with different clinical outcomes and responses to
therapy. To discover potential therapeutic targets for the poor prognosis-associated triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC), gene expression proﬁling was carried out on a cohort of 130 breast cancer samples. Polo-like kinase 1
(PLK1) was found to be signiﬁcantly overexpressed in TNBC compared with the other breast cancer subtypes.
High PLK1 expression was conﬁrmed by reverse phase protein and tissue microarrays. In triple-negative cell lines,
RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion or inhibition of PLK1 activity with a small molecule (BI-2536) induced an increase
in phosphorylated H2AX, G2–M arrest, and apoptosis. A soft-agar colony assay showed that PLK1 silencing
impaired clonogenic potential of TNBC cell lines. When cells were grown in extracellular matrix gels (Matrigel),
and exposed to BI-2536, apoptosis was observed speciﬁcally in TNBC cancerous cells, and not in a normal cell line.
When administrated as a single agent, the PLK1 inhibitor signiﬁcantly impaired tumor growth in vivo in
two xenografts models established from biopsies of patients with TNBC. Most importantly, the administration of
BI-2536, in combination with doxorubicin þ cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, led to a faster complete
response compared with the chemotherapy treatment alone and prevented relapse, which is the major risk
associated with TNBC. Altogether, our observations suggest PLK1 inhibition as an attractive therapeutic
approach, in association with conventional chemotherapy, for the management of patients with TNBC. Cancer

Introduction
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different
subgroups characterized by speciﬁc clinical outcomes and
responses to therapy (1). Triple-negative breast cancers
(TNBC) are characterized by a lack of expression of estrogen
and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and a lack of HER2 overAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche; 2AgroParisTech/INRA UMR MIA 518, Paris; 3Translational Research Department;

expression (2). TNBCs account for 15% of breast cancers and
are associated with African-American ethnicity, younger age,
and poorer outcome when compared with the other breast cancer subtypes: luminal A (LA), luminal B (LB), and HER2þ/ER
(HER2; ref. 2). TNBC show a high rate of TP53 mutation (3), are
associated with a "BRCAness" phenotype (4), and are highly
proliferative, genetically unstable, poorly differentiated, and
often grade 3 carcinomas (5). In contrast to HER2 and luminal
carcinomas, which can be treated with targeted therapy such
as anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies or hormonal therapies,
respectively, there is no available targeted therapy for patients
with TNBC who are managed exclusively with conventional
chemotherapy. Although they show high rates of objective
initial response, the majority of patients do not display a
complete response and have a poorer prognosis than those
within other breast tumor subgroups due to high rates of
recurrence (6). Because of this unfavorable prognosis and the
lack of targeted therapy, there is currently an intensive search
for identifying therapeutic targets for TNBC (7).
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is the best-characterized member
of the human PLK family (PLK1-5) of serine/threonine protein
kinases, which is involved in various functions such as mitotic
entry, spindle assembly, and DNA damage response (8). In

PLK1 as a Therapeutic Target in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

normal tissues, PLK1 is only found in actively proliferative
tissues. PLK1 is overexpressed in diverse tumors including
breast cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis (9–13).
High PLK1 levels have been found in TNBC (9, 14), and PLK1
has recently been proposed to be a potential therapeutic target
for TNBC based on a protein kinase siRNA library screen and in
vitro assays (15). Besides proliferation, the overexpression of
PLK1 in mouse NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts transforms the cells, making them capable to form tumors when injected in mice (16).
PLK1 depletion/inhibition triggers apoptosis in various cancer
cell lines, and impairs tumor growth in mice (17). PLK1
depletion/inhibition preferentially kills cancer cells compared
with normal cells (18–20) and p53-defective cancer cells compared with p53 wild-type cancer cells (21–23). Several PLK1
inhibitors have been developed; some of them, such as BI-2536,
have been evaluated in clinical trials (8, 24–27).
We conducted RNA microarrays on a cohort composed of
tumor samples, healthy breast tissues, and triple-negative cell
lines. PLK1 was overexpressed in TNBC compared with healthy
tissues and to the other breast cancer subtypes. We examined
the effects of PLK1 depletion (RNAi) and inhibition (BI-2536)
on the behavior of triple-negative cell lines and in human
TNBC-derived xenograft models. In vitro or in vivo, these
experiments showed a beneﬁcial effect of targeting PLK1 in
TNBC.

Materials and Methods
Human samples, clinical, and microarray data
Our cohort was composed of 35 LA, 40 LB, 46 TNBC, 33
HER2, 18 normal breast tissues, and 14 TNBC cell lines.
Experiments were conducted in agreement with the Bioethic
Law No. 2004–800 and the Ethic Charter from the French
National Institute of Cancer (INCa), and after approval of the
ethics committee of our Institution. Immunohistochemistry
with PLK1 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) was conducted as described (28). Clinical data were collected and
disease-free interval was deﬁned as the time from the diagnosis
of breast cancer to the occurrence of a locoregional, distant, or
controlateral recurrence. DNA (Affymetrix SNP6.0), RNA (Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0), and RPPA microarrays were conducted
as described (28).
Cell culture, RNA interference, PLK1 inhibitor, and
cellular assays
Cell lines were purchased in 2006 and 2008 from the American Type Culture Collection, and cultured as described (28).
The cell lines have been characterized by DNA and RNA
microarrays (year 2009). Cells were transfected with 20
nmol/L of either a control RNAi (AllStars) or 2 distinct PLK1
RNAi (PLK1#6, PLK1#7; all from Qiagen), or incubated with a
PLK1 inhibitor (BI-2536; Selleck Chemicals). Cell proliferation

was determined by MTT (Sigma). Caspase 3/7 activity was
determined by the Caspase-Glo 3/7 luminescent assay (Promega) or by Western blot analysis as described (28). Cell-cycle
analysis was carried out with FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson)
using Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson) to determine
cellular DNA content. For soft-agar colony formation, 0.35%
agar containing RNAi-transfected MDA-MB-468 and HCC70
cells was overlaid onto precast 0.5% bottom agar and incubated for 4 weeks. Colonies were visualized after MTT staining.
Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture was conducted with
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) as described (29). Brieﬂy, MDAMB-468 and MCF10A were grown in the 3D on-top assay for
7 and 10 days, respectively. Cells were then treated with BI2536, and cell viability was determined 3 days later using the
WST1 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Millipore).
Mice, compounds, treatment, and tumor growth
measurement
Mice were purchased from Charles River. Their care and
housing were conformed to the institutional guidelines as put
forth by the French Ethical Committee. Human TNBC breast
cancer xenograft models (HBCx-10 and HBCx-24) were established as previously detailed (30–32). HBCx-10 represents a
xenograft model of doxorubicin þ cyclophosphamide (DC)induced complete remission and tumor recurrence (30, 31),
whereas HBCx-24 does not respond to DC (not shown). Micebearing human breast cancer xenografts were treated intraperitoneally with BI-2536 (Selleck Chemicals, 20 mg/kg) twice a
week alone or combined with doxorubicin (Teva Pharmaceuticals, 2 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (Baxter, 100 mg/kg) at
days 1, 22, and 43. Tumor growth was evaluated with a caliper
twice a week.
Statistical analysis
The R software was used for statistical analyses (33). Pearson
correlation was used to estimate an association between 2
variables. For cellular assays and in vivo experiments, P values
were calculated using the Student t test.
Additional experimental details are available in the Supplemental Material.

Results
PLK1 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer
To discover potential therapeutic targets for the poor prognosis-associated TNBC, a gene expression proﬁling was carried
out on a cohort of 130 breast cancers. PLK1 was expressed at
higher levels in TNBC (mean log2 ¼ 4.36) compared with HER2
(mean log2 ¼ 2.6; P ¼ 2.8  1010), LA (mean log2 ¼ 1.56; P < 2 
1016), LB (mean log2 ¼ 2.16; P ¼ 7.6  1013), and normal
tissues (mean log2 ¼ 1.97; P ¼ 1.1  109; Fig. 1A). PLK1 protein
levels, measured by reverse phase protein array, were higher in

nuclear localization. Scale bar, 30 mm (D). E, PLK1 analysis at the DNA level. The smoothed segmented copy number (CN) signal is presented in boxplots, with
dashed lines indicating the thresholds retained to call CN gains and losses. F, correlation between PLK1 mRNA and Ki67 mRNA within the TNBC
subtype. Each tumor is represented by a solid circle. Kaplan–Meier curves of metastasis-free interval (G) and disease-free interval (H) for TNBC divided into
tertiles according to their PLK1 expression by comparing the combined 2 top tertiles (>3.94) with the lowest tertile (3.94) of PLK1 mRNA expression. Being in
the lowest tertile was associated with a higher risk of developing metastasis (HR ¼ 4.05, 95%CI ¼ 1.17–14.05, P ¼ 0.028, log-rank test) and disease
(HR ¼ 3.41, 95% CI ¼ 1.03–11.26, P ¼ 0.045, log-rank test).

considered as high for PLK1 expression (PLK1 >3.94) and
compared with the low tertile (PLK1 3.94). Being in the
lowest tertile was signiﬁcantly associated with a higher risk
of developing metastasis (Fig. 1G) and disease (Fig. 1H) than
being in the 2 highest tertiles.

Supplementary Fig. S1E and F). PLK5 was not detected in
our study. In conclusion, transcriptomic data showed that
TNBC overexpressed both PLK1 and PLK4, and underexpressed PLK2. These results suggest that PLK1 and PLK4
may represent attractive therapeutic targets for this subgroup of breast cancer. We then focused on PLK1 because
several PLK1 inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials
(8, 27, 34, 35).

RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion impairs clonogenicity
and viability in triple-negative cell lines
PLK1 expression was analyzed in a panel of triple-negative
cell lines including the "normal" MCF10A cells (Fig. 2A). PLK1
silencing using 2 different RNAi signiﬁcantly impaired HCC70
and MDA-MB-468 to form colonies in a soft agar assay (Fig. 2B),
indicating that PLK1 was required for anchorage-independent
growth. Proliferation assays upon RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion were then conducted. MDA-MB-468 viability was impaired
after RNAi transfection (Fig. 2C), and more pronounced effects
were observed in MCF10A (Fig. 2D). PLK1-depletion inhibited

The lowest tertile of PLK1 expression is associated with

We investigated the relationship between PLK1 expression
and prognosis within our TNBC subcohort. As there was no
consensual prognostic threshold, patients with TNBC were
initially divided into tertiles based on their PLK1 mRNA
expression levels. As the second and third top tertiles were
prognostically favorable (not shown), they were combined and

the proliferation of all tested TNBC cell lines (Fig. 2E). Our data
with MCF10A were in contrast with those suggesting that these
"normal" cells were less sensitive to PLK1 depletion (18, 19).
However, MCF10A cells were the cells growing the fastest with
a doubling time in 96-well plates as follows: MCF10A (16
hours), MDA-MB-231 (25 hours), MDA-MB-468 (40 hours),
HCC1937 (40 hours), HCC70 (50 hours), and BT20 (60 hours;
not shown). Therefore, this result is not surprising, considering
the function of PLK1 in mitosis.
RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion induces DNA breaks,
G2–M arrest, and apoptosis in triple-negative cell lines
We next analyzed by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) the effect of PLK1 depletion on cell-cycle progression.
After RNAi transfection, MDA-MB-468 and MCF10A arrested
in G2–M, and the percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA content
increased suggesting that PLK1-depleted cells undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2F and G). Annexin V staining experiments showed
that PLK1 silencing induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and
MCF10A (30%–40%; Fig. 3A and B). Caspases 3/7 were activated in both cell lines after PLK1 RNAi transfection (Fig. 3C
and D), and this was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis with
the appearance of their cleaved forms, and the cleaved form of
their substrate Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP; Fig. 3E
and F). PLK1 depletion induced H2AX phosphorylation,
reﬂecting the presence of DNA breaks (Fig. 3E and F).
BI-2536–mediated PLK1 inhibition induces apoptosis
and impairs viability in triple-negative cell lines
We next analyzed the effect of BI-2536, a PLK1 inhibitor, on
the behavior of triple-negative cell lines. BI-2536 impaired
cell viability in the nanomolar range (Table 1). In contrast to
the results obtained after RNAi-mediated PLK1 depletion,
MCF10A cells were less sensitive to PLK1 inhibition compared
with the other cell lines. BI-2536 treatment of MDA-MB-468
and MCF10A induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4A and B). Caspase 3/7 activity was detected at 10 nmol/L
BI-2536 in both cell lines, and at 5 nmol/L only in MDA-MB-468
(Fig. 4A and B). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed these results,
with the detection of cleaved caspases 3, 7, and 8 and PARP

after cell treatment with 10 nmol/L BI-2536 (Fig. 4C and D).
Again, 5 nmol/L BI-2536 induced the cleavage of PARP and
caspases only in MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 4C and D). Phosphorylated H2AX was induced by BI-2536 at 5 and 10 nmol/L in
MDA-MB-468, but only at 10 nmol/L in MCF10A (Fig. 4C and
D). Overall, these results indicated that BI-2536 induced
apoptosis at lower concentrations in MDA-MB-468 compared
with MCF10A.
BI-2536–mediated PLK1 inhibition speciﬁcally affects
malignant cells in three-dimensional culture
BI-2536 was tested in triple-negative cell lines grown in a
more physiologic context, in 3D culture in Matrigel (29).
Under these conditions, nontransformed mammary epithelial cell lines, such as MCF10A, recapitulate epithelial morphogenesis by forming acinar structures within 10 days of
culture, and then stop to grow, whereas cancer cells, such as
MDA-MB-468, exhibit disorganized structures and continue
to proliferate (36). BI-2536, added to these structures once
formed, was effective on MDA-MB-468, and had no effect on
MCF10A (Fig. 4E). This may be explained by the fact that
MCF10A does not express PLK1 once the acini are formed
(Fig. 4F).
BI-2536–mediated PLK1 inhibition impairs tumor
growth in human triple-negative breast cancer xenograft
models
To evaluate the antitumoral effects of PLK1 inhibition in
vivo, BI-2536 was administrated in 2 breast cancer xenograft
models established from patients with TNBC (30, 32). BI-2536,
administrated alone, induced a dramatic tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in both models (P < 0.0001) with a TGI of 99% (Fig.
5A) and 85% (Fig. 5B). No body weight loss was observed (not
shown). Three of 8 (37.5%) mice showed a complete response
(CR) at day 24 in the HBCx-24 model (not shown). No CR was
observed with the HBCx-10 model, and tumor relapsed after
BI-2536 withdrawal (Fig. 5B and Table 2).
BI-2536 in combination with chemotherapy impairs
tumor relapse in a human triple-negative breast cancer–
derived xenograft model of tumor recurrence
We next addressed whether inhibition of PLK1 could impair
tumor relapse after conventional chemotherapy, a major issue
for patients with TNBC. We had the opportunity to test in vivo
this hypothesis using the HBCx-10 model, which represents a
model of chemotherapy-induced complete remission and
tumor recurrence (31). A combination of DC, used for the
management of TNBC patients, led ﬁrst to CR; however, the
tumor relapsed after stopping DC treatment (Fig. 5B, Table 2).
The combination of DC with BI-2536 induced 100% CR, which
were observed earlier than CR induced by DC treatment alone
(Fig. 5B and Table 2). BI-2536 þ DC combination impaired
tumor relapse in contrast to DC alone (Table 2). At day 200, 4
mice were still tumor-free and could be considered as cured
(Table 2). Altogether, these data suggested that, in vivo, PLK1
inhibition in combination with conventional chemotherapy is
more efﬁcient to achieve CR and, most importantly, impaired
tumor relapse.

Discussion
Treatment of patients with TNBC remains a major challenge
for oncologists. Although they respond well to the current
therapeutic strategies based on conventional chemotherapies,
they represent a large proportion of breast cancer death
because of a high recurrence rate. Alternative treatments are
therefore needed to improve survival of these patients.
We found that both PLK1 and PLK4 are overexpressed in
TNBC, and may represent potential therapeutic targets. We
focused on PLK1 as small-molecule inhibitors have been
evaluated in clinical trials. We conﬁrmed previous analysis
showing that PLK1 belongs to a list of 16 kinases overexpressed
in TNBC compared with LA (14). We validated this TNBCspeciﬁc high PLK1 expression at a protein level using RPPA and
immunohistochemistry techniques. High PLK1 protein expression has been reported in breast cancers (10, 13), speciﬁcally in
TNBC (9), and shown to be associated with poor prognosis (9).
We also found that high PLK1 expression is associated with

poor prognosis within the entire population; this could be
simply reﬂecting the high expression of PLK1 in the poor
prognosis-associated TNBC subtype. In fact, we found that,
within the TNBC subtype, high PLK1 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This may be explained by the fact
that low PLK1-expressing tumors respond worse to conventional chemotherapy, possibly due to their lowest proliferative
rates.
PLK1 is the most investigated PLK family member and has
been pointed out as an oncology target due to its overexpression in several tumors (12, 17). Therefore, many studies have
analyzed the effects of PLK1 inhibition/depletion in various
cancer cells (17). In agreement with those studies, we observed
that PLK1 depletion/inhibition had similar effects in triplenegative cell lines: increase of DNA breaks, G2–M arrest, and
apoptosis as well as inhibition of cell viability and tumorigenicity. We found that RNAi-mediated PLK1 silencing and BI2536-mediated PLK1 inhibition promoted similar cellular
effects. Nevertheless, we noticed some differences. When compared with TNBC cell lines, the "normal" MCF10A were most
sensitive to PLK1 silencing (RNAi) but less sensitive to PLK1
inhibition (BI-2536). BI-2536 inhibits the activity of all PLKs,

suggesting that the inhibition of several PLKs, compared with a
speciﬁc silencing of PLK1, could differentially affect cancer
cells. On the other hand, knocking down the expression may
have different consequences compared with the inhibition of
the kinase activity. Inhibiting the activity of PLK1 may be more
speciﬁc to cancer cells than knocking down its expression,
which abolishes not only its kinase activity but also interactions with its cellular partners. PLK1 is essential for mitosis
entry and it is not surprising that its inhibition/depletion
impairs viability of cultured cells. However, it is interesting
to point out that the consequences of PLK1 knockdown are not
only related to the proliferative status of cells. Indeed, BT-20,
the cancer cells of our panel with the lowest proliferative rate
are the most sensitive to PLK1 inhibition and silencing. These
cells may have some characteristics that render them more
sensitive to PLK1 inhibition. The depletion of the tumor
suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
on chromosome 10) induces an elevated expression of PLK1 in
prostate cancer cells, and PTEN-null prostate cells are more
sensitive to PLK1 inhibition compared with PTEN wt prostate
cells (37). PTEN loss, which is a hallmark of TNBC (28, 38, 39),
may therefore confer a higher sensitivity to PLK1 inhibition to

PLK1 as a Therapeutic Target in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

this subgroup of breast cancer; however, this feature is shared
by triple-negative cell lines (28) and could not account for the
high sensitivity of BT20 [which in fact express low PTEN levels
compared with the other triple-negative cell lines with no
detectable PTEN (28)] to PLK1 inhibition. PLK1 has been
found to form a synthetic lethal pair with mutated Ras (40),
but Ras is not mutated in human breast cancer and in the
triple-negative cell lines we analyzed in this article, with the
exception of MDA-MB-231 (41, 42).
Antitumoral effects of BI-2536 have been observed in vivo in
xenograft models derived from various cell lines (25). In more
relevant preclinical models established from human TNBC, we
observed that BI-2536, administrated alone, impaired tumor
growth. However, we noticed that the tumor relapsed after the
treatment was stopped. We had the opportunity to evaluate the
effect of BI-2536 on tumor recurrence, the major issue for
patients with TNBC, by using a xenograft model characterized
with high sensitivity to anthracycline-based chemotherapy
followed by tumor relapse (31). In combination with DC used
in clinic for the management of patients with TNBC, BI-2536
led to a faster CR compared with DC alone, and most importantly impaired relapse after the treatments were stopped.
Although BI-2536 has been shown to be well tolerated (25),
some mice died during the combination treatment for
unknown reasons. However, no relapse was observed still
200 days after the beginning of the experiment for the surviving
mice. Further experiments should be carried out to analyze
whether impaired relapse could still be observed at lower doses
of BI-2536, to avoid toxicity, in combination with DC. Our in
vivo results suggest that the BI-2536 þ DC association was
capable to eradicate all the cancer cells. The tumor-initiating
cells, which are resilient to chemotherapy and radiation, are
thought to be responsible for tumor relapse. Recently, RNAi
and small-molecule kinase inhibitors screens identiﬁed PLK1
as a protein kinase that targets the tumor-initiating cells from
breast cancer (15) and neuroblastoma (43).
Because of the high sequence homology between the different PLK, PLK1 inhibitors are not speciﬁc to PLK1 (44).
Therefore, this may be a concern as these kinases seem to
have different expression patterns and nonoverlapping functions; the lack of selectivity of PLK1 inhibitors may result in
undesired effects (8, 17). Indeed, PLK2 may act as a tumor
suppressor in vivo (17), and we show that the PLK2 gene is
speciﬁcally lost in TNBC. The inhibitor used in our study, BI2536, inhibits PLK1 (IC50 ¼ 0.83 nmol/L), PLK2 (IC50 ¼ 3.5
nmol/L), and PLK3 (IC50 ¼ 9.0 nmol/L; 25). New compounds
targeting speciﬁcally PLK1 within the PLK family may avoid
the undesired effects of the nonselective PLK1 inhibitors.
Several PLK1 inhibitors have been evaluated in phase I/II
clinical trials (26, 27, 34, 35). BI-2536 phase I trials revealed that
the drug was well tolerated with minor antitumor responses
(27, 45). Two phase II trials have shown that BI-2536 mono-

therapy had limited antitumor activity (46, 47). Only 14 patients
with breast cancers were enrolled in one of the trials with no
reported information regarding their molecular subtypes (46).
Patients with TNBC have increased pathologic CR rates compared with non-TNBC, and those with pathologic complete
response have excellent survival. However, patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have signiﬁcantly
worse survival (6). Although clinical trials with a PLK1 inhibitor
used as a single agent did not show high antitumor activity in
different types of cancers, we suggest that PLK1 may represent
a promising therapeutic target in combination with conventional chemotherapy, in particular for the treatment of patients
with TNBC. Indeed, TNBC express high levels of PLK1, and the
association of a PLK1 inhibitor with a conventional chemotherapy treatment impairs tumor relapse in vivo in a recurrence-prone TNBC xenograft model.
