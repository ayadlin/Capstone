ABSTRACT
Checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionizing treatment options and expectations
for patients with melanoma. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), was the first approved checkpoint
inhibitor. Emerging long-term data indicate that approximately 20% of ipilimumabtreated patients achieve long-term survival. The first programmed death 1 (PD-1)
inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of melanoma; nivolumab was previously approved
in Japan. PD-1 inhibitors are also poised to become standard of care treatment for
other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibition is a different treatment
approach to chemotherapy and targeted agents: instead of directly acting on the
tumor to induce tumor cell death, checkpoint inhibitors enhance or de novo stimulate
antitumor immune responses to eliminate cancer cells. Initial data suggest that
objective anti-tumor response rates may be higher with anti-PD-1 agents compared
with ipilimumab and the safety profile may be more tolerable. This review explores
the development and next steps for PD-1 pathway inhibitors, including discussion of
their novel mechanism of action and clinical data to-date, with a focus on melanoma.

monoclonal antibodies that can induce an antitumor
immune response by blocking the checkpoint molecule
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
[12, 13]. Although these anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have
modest response rates in the range of 10% [12, 13],
ipilimumab significantly improves OS, with a subset of
patients experiencing long-term survival benefit [14].
In a phase III trial, tremelimumab was not associated
with an improvement in OS [13], and tremelimumab is
not currently approved for the treatment of melanoma.
Across clinical trials, survival for ipilimumab-treated
patients begins to separate from those patients treated
in control arms at around 4–6 months, and improved
survival rates are seen at 1, 2, and 3 years [12, 14, 15]
(Table 1 [4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16–25]). Further, in aggregating
data for patients treated with ipilimumab, it appears that
there may be a plateau in survival at approximately 3
years. Thereafter, patients who remain alive at 3 years
may experience a persistent long-term survival benefit,
including some patients who have been followed for

INTRODUCTION
Despite recent clinical advancements, the treatment
of advanced melanoma continues to represent a significant
challenge. Historically, the 5-year survival rate for
patients with stage IV disease was approximately 6%
[1–3]. However, agents introduced in recent years have
substantially improved the outlook for patients with
melanoma. For example, BRAF or MEK inhibitors such as
vemurafenib, dabrafenib or trametinib, which are indicated
in the approximately 50–60% of patients with melanoma
harboring a BRAFV600E/K mutation, are associated with
high response rates (~20–80%), prolonged progressionfree survival (PFS) (5–9 months), and improved overall
survival (OS) [4–7]. Unfortunately, most if not all patients
receiving BRAF or MEK inhibitors eventually develop
resistant tumors leading to disease progression [4, 6, 8–11].
In contrast to these kinase inhibitors, a second
major advance in clinical therapeutics came with
the development of ipilimumab and tremelimumab;

up to 10 years [14, 26]. While BRAF inhibitors also
provide improved OS over chemotherapy, similar longterm follow up is not yet available with these agents. It is
possible that the long-term effect seen with ipilimumab
is unique to immunotherapeutic approaches, as similar
long-term survival in a subset of patients has been
previously reported with interleukin (IL)-2 therapy [27].
These observations suggest that in some patients treated
with immunotherapy, cancer can be kept in check for an
extended period of time, which may be a consequence
of an effective and ongoing immune response. The next
generation of checkpoint inhibitors, used either as single
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

agents or in combination regimens, offers the promise of
extending clinical benefits to a larger number of patients.

Mechanisms of action of immune checkpoint
inhibitors
The goal of immunotherapy is to elicit or enhance
antitumor immune responses. Whereas BRAF and MEK
targeted agents specifically inhibit a node in the MAPK
signaling pathway that can eventually be overcome by
tumor mutation, cancer immunotherapy has the potential
to induce the inherent capacity of the immune system

to adapt to mutational tumor changes. Though cancer
immunotherapy approaches have been pursued for
decades and have been successful in some cases (e.g. IL-2
in melanoma), checkpoint inhibition and, in particular,
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, is the first strategy that is poised to
impact the outcome in cancer patients on a broader scale.
Under physiologic conditions, both stimulatory
and inhibitory pathways regulate the inflammatory
immune response to pathogens and maintain tolerance
to self-antigens. These are regulated by a diverse set of
immune checkpoints, thereby protecting healthy tissues
from damage [18]. These checkpoints can be co-opted
by malignant tumors to dampen the immune response
and evade destruction by the immune system [18]. The
CTLA-4 and PD-1pathways have been the initial focus of
anticancer agent development (Figure 1); agents targeting
other pathways are also in development [18].
Generally, the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways operate
at different stages of the immune response (Figure 1) [28].
CTLA-4 modulates the immune response early—at the time
of T-cell activation by antigen presenting cells (APCs). T
cells are activated by antigen presented on APC in the context
of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (signal 1), as
well as co-stimulatory binding of CD28 to B7 (CD80/86)
(signal 2). Upon T-cell activation, CTLA-4 is trafficked from
the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane where it outcompetes CD28 in binding to B7 ligands on APCs due to its

Lymph node

much higher binding affinity. CTLA-4 binding to B7 ligands
inhibits further T-cell activation, limiting the time for T-cell
activity. In this way, the magnitude and duration of initial
immune responses is physiologically controlled.
In the setting of cancer, inhibiting CTLA-4 may
lead to continued activation of a larger number of T
cells, resulting in more effective antitumor responses
(Figure 2A). Preclinical evidence suggests that antiCTLA-4 antibody can also deplete or inhibit regulatory
T cells present in the tumor [19, 29]. CTLA-4 blockade
has the potential to activate T cells that are specific for a
wide range of antigens, including self-antigens, or deplete
regulatory T cells that control autoreactive effector T
cells, which may explain the autoimmune-like toxicities
observed with CTLA-4 blockade.
In contrast to the effect of CTLA-4 on early T-cell
activation, the PD-1 pathway appears to impact the T-cell
response at the (later) effector stage (Figure 1). PD-1 is
upregulated on T cells after persistent antigen exposure,
typically in response to chronic infections or tumors. PDL1 and PD-L2, the ligands for PD-1, can be expressed
by tumor cells, as well as several other hematopoietic
and non-hematopoietic cell types. Expression of PDL1 and PD-L2 is induced by inflammatory cytokines,
predominately interferon-γ [30]. In tumors, oncogenic
signaling pathways can also upregulate PD-L1 expression
[31]. When PD-1 binds its ligand, the T cell receives an

in the context of MHC (signal 1), as well as co-stimulatory binding of CD28 to B7 (CD80/86) (signal 2). T cells upregulate CTLA-4 shortly
after activation. Ligation of CTLA-4 with CD80 or CD86 limits T-cell activation and proliferation. Activated T cells traffic to the periphery
and encounter tumor antigens at the tumor site. PD-1 is upregulated on T cells after prolonged activation; binding to PD-1 ligands (PD-L1
or PD-L2) expressed by tumor or other immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, causes T-cell activation and dampens an
ongoing antitumor immune response.

tumor site and also facilitate T-cell activation in lymph nodes or other sites. Activation of T cells with cross-reactivity to host antigens

inhibitory signal. Over time, chronic inhibition via PD1:PD-L1 in tumor leads to T-cell anergy and blockade of a
productive antitumor immune response [32].
Expression of PD-1 ligands is a mechanism for
tumors to evade antitumor immune responses [30]. In many
tumor types, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have
been observed in both primary and metastatic specimens,
indicating immune recognition of cancer cells. The
presence of these TILs has been associated with improved
outcomes in several cancers, including melanoma and
renal cell carcinoma [33, 34]. Blockade of the PD-1/PDL1 axis may restore the activity of TILs that have become
quiescent as a result of PD-L1 ligation (Figure 2B).
Whereas CTLA-4 is widely expressed by T cells,
PD-1 is expressed by activated T cells that have developed
an “exhausted” or near-anergic state. PD-1 pathway
blockade, in contrast to CTLA-4 blockade, may thus
enhance activation of T cells with greater selectivity for
tumors. However, human tumors can also express PD-L2,
and this ligand has been found to be a negative prognostic
factor in some cancers [30, 35]. PD-1 has a higher affinity
for PD-L2 than for PD-L1, although whether this leads to
differences in signaling or T-cell functions is not known
[35]. PD-L2 is expressed in a number of tissues, most
notably the lung, where it dampens the immune response
to self-antigens and prevents autoimmunity [36]. It has
been postulated that for selective blockade of PD-1:PD-L1
binding, keeping PD-1:PD-L2 interactions intact could
offer a benefit in terms of reduced toxicities [37]. However,
to date, a differential toxicity profile has not been observed
between anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, and no
direct comparisons from randomized trials are available.
Monoclonal antibodies directed at PD-1 (nivolumab,
pembrolizumab, pidilizumab [CT-011]) are designed to
prevent PD-1 from binding both PD-L1 and PD-L2 (Table
1 [4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16–25]). PD-L1 inhibitors (MEDI4736,
MPDL3280A, and MSB0010718C) block PD-1:PD-L1
binding, but not PD-1:PD-L2 binding. PD-L1 blockade also
inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to CD80, which is expressed
on activated T cells. The implication of this additional
effect is not clear, as the role of PD-L1:CD80 interaction
is not fully understood [18]. Pembrolizumab was approved
by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in September 2014 for the treatment of patients
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease
progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAFV600 mutant,
a BRAF inhibitor. Nivolumab was approved in Japan for
the treatment of patients with unresectable melanoma in
July 2014. The other PD-1 and PD-L1 directed agents are
currently in Phase I–III clinical trials in multiple tumor types.

receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer.
These agents specifically inhibit oncogenic signaling
pathways. However, response duration with these agents
has been modest. For example, the median PFS of BRAF
inhibitors in BRAFV600E/K mutant melanoma ranges from
5–8 months [4, 8, 10, 11]. With dual BRAF and MEK
blockade, PFS is longer, approximately 9 months [6, 9].
Checkpoint inhibitors display a range of response
patterns, which may reflect the complexities of inducing a
tumor-directed immune response and the individuality of
a patient’s immune system and tumor. Response kinetics
may also depend on which pathway is inhibited. In
theory, a patient with extensive tumor infiltration of PD-1expressing T cells could have a rapid response with a PD-1
pathway inhibitor. In contrast, a patient with low numbers
of pre-existing tumor-specific T cells could have a delayed
or no response to PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathway blockade.
Late or delayed responses occurring months to years after
treatment initiation have been described with checkpoint
inhibitors [17, 38–40]. In the case of a delayed response,
tumor size may initially increase—as a result of either true
tumor growth or increased tumor volume due to infiltration
by immune cells—prior to subsequent tumor regression.
As such, PFS based on traditionally used response criteria,
such as RECIST, may not be the most appropriate efficacy
measure with immunotherapies. To guide clinical practice,
expert opinion has suggested the use of modified response
criteria for immunotherapies, termed immune-related
response criteria (irRC). These response criteria take into
account the potential for increase in tumor size or number
of lesions prior to declaration of progressive disease
(Table 2 [12, 17, 21, 38, 40–46]). It has been suggested that
RECIST may underestimate the benefit of PD-1 inhibitors
in approximately 10% of patients relative to irRC [41].
In clinical trials of ipilimumab, responses
predominately occurred by 12 weeks, though there was
a subset of patients with delayed response [47]. Further,
some patients had an initial partial response that later
converted to a complete response; the average time to
reach a complete response was 30 months [47]. At the
FDA-approved dose of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every
3 weeks), an open-label phase I trial reported an ORR
of 26% in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced
melanoma. The majority of patients had a response by
the time of first assessment at 3 months (12 weeks); the
median time to response was 3 months (range: 2.8 to 9)
[48]. In a phase III trial of nivolumab (3 mg/kg, every 2
weeks) in patients with untreated metastatic melanoma,
the ORR was 40% (versus 14% with dacarbazine). The
median time to response with nivolumab was 2.1 months
(range: 1.2 to 7.6), similar to that of dacarbazine (median
2.1 months; range: 1.8 to 3.6) [46].
In addition to delayed responses, treatment with
checkpoint inhibition has been associated with durable,
long-lasting responses, even after discontinuing therapy
in some patients. In the phase I trial of nivolumab, the

vmedian duration of responses was 99 weeks (range,
17+ to 117+ weeks), and 56% (19/34) of responses were
ongoing at the time of last analysis (range of follow-up of
responding patients, approximately 32–144 weeks, median
follow up not disclosed) [20]. With shorter follow-up in the
pembrolizumab trial, the median response duration had not
been reached (range, 6+ to 76+ weeks), and 88% of responses
were ongoing (range of follow-up of responding patients,
approximately 18–88 weeks, median follow up not disclosed)
[40]. Many patients who have discontinued immunotherapy
(either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4) for reasons other than
disease progression had persistent responses, indicative
of a sustained antitumor immune response. In the phase 1
trial of nivolumab, 52% (11/21) of responding patients who
discontinued therapy early had responses lasting ≥ 24 weeks
off therapy [20]. Of these 11 patients, 7 (64%) had ongoing
responses at the time of analysis.

Survival data with PD-1 inhibitors are promising.
Significantly improved survival was seen with nivolumab
versus dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated
metastatic melanoma in a randomized phase III trial
[46]. The 1-year survival rate was 73% with nivolumab
and 42% with dacarbazine, and median PFS was 5.1
months and 2.2 months, respectively. In the phase I trial
of pembrolizumab, median OS was not reached at the time
of analysis, and 1-year and 18-month survival rates were
69% and 62%, respectively. In this study, 48% of patients
had received ≥ 2 prior therapies [40]. Median OS was 17.3
months for all patients treated in the nivolumab phase I
trial, 62% of whom had received ≥ 2 prior therapies, and
1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 63%, 48%, and 41%,
respectively [20].

Safety profile with checkpoint inhibitors

Survival with checkpoint inhibitors

Safety with monotherapy

In clinical practice, ipilimumab is administered at 3 mg/
kg every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses, based on the approved
FDA label [49]. There is speculation in the field as to whether
a higher dose (10 mg/kg) or the possibility of maintenance
administration (every 12 weeks after the initial 4 doses)
could influence the activity of the drug, and clinical trials
are ongoing to investigate these possibilities. Nevertheless,
the approved regimen has led to > 5-year survival in some
heavily pretreated patients [14, 26, 47]. The durability
and adaptability of tumor responses among patients who
discontinued nivolumab and pembrolizumab therapy may
be similar to that observed with ipilimumab, and may also
explain partial or complete responses observed in patients
who received PD-1 inhibitors after ipilimumab [40, 50].

Related to the immune mechanism of antitumor
activity, checkpoint inhibitors are associated with immunerelated adverse events (irAEs). While different from those
of targeted agents and chemotherapy, the safety profiles
of checkpoint inhibitors are typically manageable and
tolerable for most patients. Since these therapies induce
tumor regression by stimulation of immune responses,
side effects may be caused by activating potentially
self-reactive T cells (Figure 2A and 2B). One exception
to this is hypophysitis, which is reported in about 4% of
patients receiving ipilimumab, and is attributed to ectopic
expression of CTLA-4 in the pituitary gland, leading
to ipilimumab binding to endocrine cells, complement
fixation, and inflammation [51].

In the phase III study of ipilimumab monotherapy
compared with the gp100 vaccine or ipiliumumab plus
gp100 vaccine, the incidence of grade 3–4 adverse events
(AEs) in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm was 24% [12].
In comparison, the incidence of treatment-related grade 3–4
AEs in the phase I nivolumab and pembrolizumab trials
were 22% and 12%, respectively [21, 40]. In the phase
III nivolumab trial, reported rates of treatment-related
grade 3–4 AEs were 12% with nivolumab and 18% with
dacarbazine [46]. The most commonly-reported treatmentrelated AE with ipilimumab is fatigue, while the most
common clinically significant immunologic AEs include
diarrhea/colitis, rash/pruritus, endocrinopathies, and
hepatitis (Table 2 [12, 17, 21, 35, 40–46]). While fatigue
is also common with PD-1 inhibitors, diarrhea may be less
common as compared with ipilimumab (Table 2 [12, 17, 21,
38, 40–46]). In contrast, pneumonitis, though infrequent,
may be more common with PD-1 pathway inhibitors than
with ipilimumab. The rate of grade 3–4 pneumonitis was
2% or less in trials of PD-1 pathway inhibitors [22, 52, 53].
However, pneumonitis was the cause of death in 3 patients
with cancer who received nivolumab; no deaths occurred
in patients with melanoma [21].
Most irAEs with checkpoint inhibitors occur
during the first 2 to 6 months of treatment, but can occur
anytime, even after treatment discontinuation [21, 42, 45]
(Table 2 [12, 17, 21, 38, 40–46]). The general timing and
grade of irAEs with ipilimumab have been described by
Weber and colleagues (Figure 3 [38]). However, whether
PD-1 pathway inhibitors have similar AE kinetics is

not currently clear. With chemotherapies, toxicities
can be cumulative, but this may not be the case with
immunotherapies. In patients who received up to 2 years of
nivolumab treatment, there was no evidence of increasing
toxicity with increased drug exposure [21]. Furthermore,
no maximum tolerated dose was reached in the phase I
studies of nivolumab or pembrolizumab [54, 55].
Safety with checkpoint blockade combination therapy
Preclinical animal studies suggest that dual
checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1,
and anti-PD-L1 antibodies leads to stronger immune
stimulation and enhanced antitumor activity [56]. In a
phase I trial, concurrent checkpoint blockade with both
anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1 (nivolumab)
antibodies showed increased efficacy over what has
been observed with single agent therapy. The ORR with
combination therapy was 42% across all tested doses,
versus 11% and 32% reported in trials of ipilimumab and
nivolumab monotherapy, respectively [12, 20, 57], and
42% of patients had ≥ 80% tumor reduction at 36 weeks
[57]. Preliminary survival rates at 1 and 2 years were
85% and 79%, respectively, for the combination regimen,
which compared favorably with the reported 1- and 2-year
rates of 46% and 24% for ipilimumab and 63% and 48%
for nivolumab [12, 20, 57].
Combining CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway blockade
resulted in a higher incidence of AEs compared with
single agent therapy, whereby the types of AEs were
similar to what has been observed with ipilimumab

or nivolumab alone. Sixty-two percent of patients
with concurrent ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy
experienced a grade 3–4 treatment-related AE, and 23%
of patients discontinued therapy due to a treatment-related
AE [57]. The majority of grade 3–4 treatment-related
AEs were laboratory abnormalities, including elevated
aspartate aminotransferase (13%), lipase (13%), alanine
aminotransferase (11%), creatinine (6%), and diarrhea
(6%) [50]. Multiple ongoing studies are evaluating
different checkpoint combinations and doses to optimize
the risk/benefit profile of dual checkpoint blockade [23].
Since pembrolizumab is approved for patients
with progression after ipilimumab therapy, and other
PD-1 targeting agents are likely to be approved soon,
patients who have previously received ipilimumab may
subsequently receive a different checkpoint inhibitor.
To date, trials of PD-1 pathway inhibitors in patients
who previously received ipilimumab have not shown
an increased risk of select irAEs [40, 44, 48, 58]. In one
study, patients who had previously experienced grade
3 irAEs with ipilimumab did not experience similar
AEs when treated with nivolumab [44]. In a trial of
pembrolizumab in patients who were ipilimumabnaïve or who had previously received ipilimumab (on
average 33–34 weeks prior; range, 4–248 weeks), the
rates of grade 3–4 treatment-related AEs and the rates of
patients discontinuing due to AEs were similar between
ipilimumab-naïve and ipilimumab-treated patients: 14%
versus 11% and 4% versus 5%, respectively [40, 48].
The trial investigating concurrent nivolumab
plus ipilimumab also evaluated nivolumab following
progressive disease and lack of grade 3–4 AEs in patients
who had received ipilimumab in the previous 4–12 weeks
[50]. In this cohort, 18% of patients experienced a grade
3–4 treatment-related AE and 9% of patients discontinued
due to a treatment-related AE. As patients who had
previously experienced high grade AEs with ipilimumab
were excluded, the study did not assess the safety of
sequential therapy in this patient population. While
initial evidence suggests that PD-1 pathway checkpoint
inhibitors can be used safely in patients with prior
ipilimumab treatment, no data yet exists to describe the
experience of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 antibody
following anti-PD-1 antibody. This is an area of ongoing
investigation that will be of particular importance in future
clinical practice.
Several fully-accrued trials are further investigating
ipilimumab plus nivolumab in patients with advanced
melanoma, and an expanded access program is now
available [23]. A phase II study is evaluating the safety
of sequential use of ipilimumab after nivolumab (four
3-week cycles of ipilimumab, followed by nivolumab
every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity)
versus nivolumab after ipilimumab (six 2-week cycles of
nivolumab followed by four 3-week cycles of ipilimumab
followed by nivolumab every 2 weeks until progression or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

unacceptable toxicity) [NCT01783938]. A phase III study
is evaluating nivolumab alone or with ipilimumab versus
ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced
melanoma; the primary endpoint is OS [NCT01844505].
Another phase II study has a similar design, without the
nivolumab alone group, and has ORR as the primary readout [NCT01927419]. Other combinations of a CTLA4-targeted agent plus a PD-1 pathway inhibitor are also
being evaluated in phase I trials, including ipilimumab
plus pembrolizumab or MPDL3280A, and tremelimumab
plus MEDI4736 [23].
Strategies for managing AEs with checkpoint inhibitors
Detailed treatment algorithms and recommendations
are available for the approved agent ipilimumab and
nivolumab (Table 2 [12, 17, 21, 38, 40–46]). Patients
should be examined for potential irAEs at each visit, and
prompt work-up of suspected AEs should be performed
to minimize the risk of worsening. Since asymptomatic
grade 3–4 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) have been noted
in several studies of checkpoint inhibitors, clinical trials
required that certain laboratory tests be performed at
regular intervals, including those evaluating liver, renal,
and thyroid functions [21, 38, 43, 45].
A particular AE to note with checkpoint inhibitors is
diarrhea, which is due an inflammatory immune response,
not off-target drug effects, as with chemotherapy or
targeted agents [45]. Therefore, diarrhea induced by
checkpoint blockade is treated with corticosteroids or
other immunosuppressant(s) (Table 2 [12, 17, 21, 38, 40–
46]). Similarly, most irAEs can be effectively managed
with corticosteroid treatment; however, a prolonged
taper is often required for complete resolution. General
treatment strategies for irAEs are as follows:
•	 Grade 1–2 AEs are treated symptomatically, with increased
frequency of monitoring.

•	 Grade 1–2 AEs that remain persistent or become more
symptomatic should be managed similarly to grade 3–4 AEs.
•	 Grade 3–4 AEs should be treated with corticosteroids and
tapered over 4 or more weeks [38, 42, 45, 46].

Endocrine disorders with checkpoint inhibitors
have been managed with hormone replacement, which
may or may not be permanent. Prolonged exposure to
corticosteroid therapy, possibly to manage irAEs, may
also lead to adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism.
Each of these supportive measures should be taken into
consideration during the assessment of endocrinopathies
[45]. Long-term exposure to corticosteroids can lead to
infection, with opportunistic infections and gastrointestinal
irritation [59]. Therefore, prophylactic antibiosis and
gastric acid suppression may be indicated in patients
requiring extended steroid tapers. The use of corticosteroids
to manage irAEs does not appear to negatively impact
the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors, as tumor response
duration appears to be unaffected in patients requiring this
3487

intervention [45]. In many patients, checkpoint therapy can
be restarted after successful resolution of the AE [42, 48,
54]. However, patients who experience severe AEs should
permanently discontinue treatment [38, 42, 45, 49].

needed, with one option being evaluation of the inflamed
versus non-inflamed tumor phenotype [69, 70].

Patient selection

Checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, antiPD-1, and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, have emerged as new
treatment modalities for patients with melanoma, and
likely various other cancers. For a subset of patients treated
with checkpoint inhibitors, durable clinical responses
lasting many years may be possible. Immunotherapy
combinations have shown increased efficacy and
toxicity compared with monotherapy; however, to date,
most toxicities have been manageable. Clinical trials
are underway to examine various combinations and
sequencing of ipilimumab and PD-1 pathway blockers,
and it remains to be seen if sequential administration of
immuno-oncology agents will be as efficacious or exhibit
an improved (or worsened) toxicity profile. As such,
treatment of patients with combinations or sequential
approaches will require the close attention of clinicians
for the development of immune-related toxicities. The
understanding that immunologic AEs are caused by
uncontrolled off-target immune responses, and therefore
frequently require active treatment with steroids, is critical
for clinicians to effectively manage patients receiving
these therapies.

CONCLUSION

The identification of a selection marker for treatment,
such as a BRAF mutation in melanoma, offers the ability to
prospectively identify patients more likely to benefit from
certain therapies. While ORRs with targeted therapies are
high, not all patients are eligible. Initial evidence suggests
that checkpoint inhibition may be more broadly applicable
than targeted therapy. In trials of patients with melanoma
being treated with checkpoint inhibitors, responses
have been observed in patients with and without BRAF
mutations, brain metastases, or prior treatment [12, 20,
40, 45, 57, 60]. As a potential biomarker of response, a
rise in absolute lymphocyte count at 3, 7 or 12 weeks of
ipilimumab treatment has been correlated with improved
survival [61–64]. Studies have also shown a correlation
between an increased eosinophil count—either at baseline
or a rise between the second and third ipilimumab
infusions—and improved survival [61, 65]. Also, an
exploratory study found that pembrolizumab-treated
patients with smaller baseline tumor size (≤ 90 mm) had
higher responses and improved OS at 1 year as compared
with patients with larger baseline tumors. However,
patients with larger tumors also derived benefit from
pembrolizumab [66]. Predictors of toxicity are also being
evaluated with checkpoint inhibitors. For example, IL-17
levels at 7 weeks of treatment with ipilimumab predicted
colitis [67]. Additionally, patients with a history of
autoimmune disease may be more at risk for development
of immunologic AEs with checkpoint inhibitors and were
excluded from clinical trials [43, 50, 54].
Many trials are now investigating whether PDL1 expression by tumors can be used as a predictive
biomarker of response to PD-1 pathway inhibitors. Initial
results suggest that response rates with PD-1 inhibitor
monotherapy may be higher in patients with PD-L1positive melanoma versus PD-L1 negative melanoma
[20, 46, 57, 68]. However, in nearly all studies, responses
were also seen in patients with negative or low PDL1 tumor expression. It is likely that PD-L1 expression
will be associated with an improved response rate with
single agent PD-1 inhibition. Nevertheless, tumor PD-L1
expression will not discriminate against patients unable
to benefit. In patients receiving concurrent CTLA-4 and
PD-1 pathway inhibitors, high proportions of patients
responded, regardless of baseline PD-L1 status (ORR:
57% for PD-L1 positive; 35% for PD-L1 negative) [57].
Therefore, tumor PD-L1 expression may not be useful as
a prognostic biomarker for patients receiving combination
regimens. Further evaluation of potential biomarkers is
