ABSTRACT
In the current study we examined the combination of SAHA and SBE13 in cancer
and non-cancer cells. HeLa cells displayed a synergistically reduced cell proliferation,
which was much weaker in hTERT-RPE1 or NIH-3T3 cells. Cell cycle distribution
differed in HeLa, hTERT-RPE1 and NIH-3T3 cells. SAHA-treated HeLa cells showed
slightly increasing cell numbers in G2/M phase, but after combination with SBE13
strongly elevated cell numbers in G2/M and S phase, accompanied by decreasing G0/
G1 percentages. hTERT-RPE1 and NIH-3T3 cells showed strongly enriched cell numbers
in G0/G1 phase. Western blot and quantitative real time analyses revealed reduced
Plk1 mRNA and protein in all cells. p21 protein was strongly induced in cancer, but not
in non-cancer cells, corresponding to a different localization in immunofluorescence
studies. Additionally, these revealed an abundantly present pRb protein in HeLa cells
after any treatment but almost completely vanished pRb staining in treated hTERT-RPE1
cells. These differences could be approved in Western blots against Parp and Caspase
3, which were activated in HeLa, but not in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Thus, we observed for
the first time a differential effect of cancer versus non-cancer cells after treatment with
SAHA and SBE13, which might be due to the dual role of p21.

activity and/or expression using dominant-negative mutants,
antibody microinjection, antisense oligonucleotides, small
interfering RNAs or kinase inhibitors leads to different
mistakes in centrosomal maturation, mitotic catastrophe and
increased apoptosis in cancer cells [8, 11–21]. In addition to
its role during mitosis, Plk1 has multiple functions outside
of mitosis, for example for checkpoint recovery after DNA
damage [11, 22] and for G1/S phase [23].
SBE13, a selective type II Plk1 inhibitor, is able to
induce a delay in cell cycle progression, to reduce cell
proliferation and to induce apoptosis in a broad range
of human cancer cell lines [16, 17]. SBE13 displayed
1,000-fold selectivity towards Plk family members and
did not influence Aurora A activity. SBE13 displayed a
differential effect between cancer and primary cells [24]
with especially G2/M arrest in cancer cells and transient
G0/G1 arrest in primary cells without any signs of cell
death, confirming earlier studies [18, 21].

INTRODUCTION
The search for new therapeutic strategies is an
important research field in translational cancer research.
Many strategies inhibit one or more cancer-relevant
genes with the aim to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by
inhibiting the expression or activity of the targeted genes.
One promising strategy to improve therapy is the use of
small molecule kinase inhibitors, which represent essential
tools in basic and translational research.
One attractive target gene in the fields of signaling
research and cancer therapy is the serine/threonine kinase
Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1) [1], which shows elevated activity
in all human tumors [2–4]. Plk1 plays a pivotal role for
mitosis and as a measure for the aggressiveness of a tumor
due to its important role for the mitotic checkpoints of
cancer cells [5–10]. Plk1 has predictive and prognostic
value for cancer patients [10, 11]. Interfering with Plk1

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) suppress transcription
of their specific target genes and are correlated to cancer
pathogenesis. They counteract the activity of histone
acetyl transferases, which acetylate for example histones
to make them accessible for transcription factors.
These acetylations are removed by HDACs afterwards.
Additionally, it has been described that HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi) reduce Plk1 protein, suggesting the combination
of Plk1 and HDAC inhibitors to combat cancer [25, 26].
Most of the analyzed tumor cells respond to an
inhibition of HDAC with signs of apoptosis, growth/
proliferation arrest, differentiation and altered gene
expression. However, in many cases it is unclear whether
these effects resulted from an altered gene-expression
profile or were caused by toxic effects inherent to the
substances employed [27]. Some of them are already tested
in clinical studies [28]. Various studies describe an induction
of apoptosis by HDACi which is a consequence of nonfunctional cell cycle checkpoints [29, 30]. Interestingly,
the reduction of the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF/CIP1, which is
responsible for G1 arrest of cells, can induce HDACiinduced cell death [31, 32] although p21 is upregulated by
HDACi [33].
In this article, we report the combination of SBE13
with the HDACi SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid,
Vorinostat) in cancer (HeLa cells) and non-cancer cells
(NIH-3T3 and hTERT-RPE1 cells). Potential differential
effects were elucidated by the analysis of Plk1 mRNA
and protein, the induction of apoptosis, the reduction of
proliferation, of pRb and p21 levels, of protein expression
of target proteins, and of the cell cycle distribution.

to 15% with 2.5 μM SAHA (p < 0.0001), and to 10%
with 5 μM SAHA (p = 0.0002). In NIH-3T3 cells similar
effects could be observed (Figure 1C): reduction to 46%
with 1 μM SAHA (p = 0.028), to 22% with 2.5 μM SAHA
(p = 0.0004), to 20% with 5 μM SAHA (p = 0.0003), and
to 24% with 10 μM SAHA (p = 0.002). As in HeLa and
in hTERT-RPE1 cells the reduction of Plk1 mRNA was
not stronger, but even less pronounced after combinatorial
treatment with SBE13 (10 μM SBE13: reduction to 26%
with 2.5 μM SAHA (p = 0.0002), and to 23% with 5 μM
SAHA (p = 0.004). These effects suggest an interference of
HDAC inhibitors with transcriptional regulation of Plk1 in
cancer and in non-cancer cells which is–as expected–not
influenced by additional inhibition of Plk1 activity.

Reduced levels of Plk1 protein after treatment
with SAHA and with SAHA and SBE13 together
in HeLa, hTERT-RPE1 and NIH-3T3 cells
To analyze whether the reduction of Plk1 mRNA
resulted in decreased protein levels we did Western blot
analyses targeting Plk1 in HeLa, hTERT-RPE1 and NIH-3T3
cells (Figure 2A, 2C, 2E). In all three cell lines, regardless
whether they are cancer cells (HeLa), non-transformed
immortalized cells (hTERT-RPE1) or completely normal
fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) the Plk1 protein was significantly
reduced by SAHA treatment. We observed reductions to
levels between 4 and 38% with 1 to 10 μM SAHA alone in
HeLa cells, which were less pronounced in combination with
1 μM SBE13 (levels of 48–60%, Figure 2A). In hTERTRPE1 cells Plk1 protein was reduced to levels between
23 and 73% with 500 nM–10 μM SAHA, and to levels of
16 to 74% with 10 μM SBE13 in combination with 100
nM–5 μM SAHA (Figure 2C). Comparable effects could be
observed in NIH-3T3 cells, where we detected reductions
of Plk1 protein levels to 20 to 51% with 500 nM – 10 μM
SAHA alone, and in combination with 10 μM SBE13 Plk1
protein levels were reduced to levels of 45–63% with SAHA
concentrations from 100 nM to 5 μM (Figure 2E).

RESULTS
Reduced Plk1 mRNA after treatment with SAHA
and with SAHA and SBE13 together in HeLa,
hTERT-RPE1 and NIH-3T3 cells
First, we determined the levels of Plk1 mRNA
after treatment with SAHA alone and in combination
with SBE13 in HeLa (cancer cells), hTERT-RPE1 (nontransformed immortalized) and NIH-3T3 cells (mouse
fibroblasts) (Figure 1). In HeLa cells, we observed
statistically significantly reduced mRNA levels after single
and combinatorial treatment with 1 to 10 μM SAHA
(1 μM: 39%, p = 0.008, 2.5 μM: 18%, p = 0.0004, 5 μM:
12%, p < 0.0001, 10 μM: 12%, p < 0.0001) alone and with
1 to 5 μM SAHA in combination with 1 μM SBE13 (1 μM:
32%, p = 0.002, 2.5 μM: 20%, p = 0.0007, 5 μM: 17%,
p = 0.002) (Figure 1A). In hTERT-RPE1 cells effects were
comparable with reductions to 46% with 1 μM SAHA
(p = 0.0007), to 13% with 2.5 μM SAHA (p < 0.0001),
to 2% with 5 μM SAHA (p < 0.0001), and to 2% with 10
μM SAHA (p <0.0001) (Figure 1B). In combination with
10 μM SBE13 effects were comparable to SAHA alone
showing reductions to 55% with 1 μM SAHA (p = 0.005),

Different regulation of p21 and pRb after
treatment with SAHA and SBE13 in HeLa,
hTERT-RPE1 and NIH-3T3 cells
To further investigate the underlying mechanism
we did Western blot analyses in HeLa, hTERT-RPE1
and NIH-3T3 cells targeting p21 (Figure 2B, 2D, 2F).
We observed a strong induction of p21 protein in HeLa
cells after single and combinatorial treatment to levels of
nearly 4000% (Figure 2B), which could not be observed
in hTERT-RPE1 cells, which showed p21 levels between
100 and 150% compared to control cells (Figure 2D).
NIH-3T3 cells showed an increase of p21 protein, but
this induction was much weaker than in HeLa cells (a
maximum induction to approx. 500% compared to almost
4000% in HeLa cells, Figure 2F).

Additionally a cell cycle marker, phosphorylated Rb
protein, was analyzed to distinguish between cell cycle
arrest types or apoptosis induction in HeLa and hTERTRPE1 cells. hTERT-RPE1 cells showed the expected
strong decreased phospho-Rb protein after SBE13
treatment which has been already described [24], but in
addition, we could see a strong decrease after SAHA or
the combinatorial treatment (Figure 2D, lower panel). In
contrast, HeLa cells showed a strong increase of phosphoRb after SAHA treatment (Figure 2B, lower panel)
corresponding to an override of the G1/S checkpoint as
observed in earlier studies also for SBE13 [24].

strongly reduced after the combination of SAHA with
SBE13 (Figure 4A). In hTERT-RPE1 cells, we observed
a different cell cycle distribution (Figure 4B): SAHA
alone and SAHA together with SBE13 differed only
slightly, both inducing a slight increase of cells in G2/M
phase and a very strong enrichment of cells in G0/G1
phase. NIH-3T3 cells showed strongly elevated numbers
of cells in G0/G1 phase after single and combinatorial
treatment (Figure 4C), which is in concordance with the
expectation based on our own studies using SBE13 in
primary cells [24].

Immunofluorescence analysis of pRb and p21
after treatment with SAHA and SBE13 in HeLa
and hTERT-RPE1 cells

The proteasome inhibitor MG132 does not
abrogate the reduction of Plk1 or p21 protein
after treatment with SAHA in HeLa cells

To analyze the differences between HeLa
and hTERT-RPE1 cells in more detail we did
immunofluorescence analyses in SBE13- and SAHAtreated cancer and non-cancer cells (Figure 4D, 4E). The
phospho-Rb protein is indicative of a functional G1/S
checkpoint, and our own studies using SBE13 revealed
an override of G1/S checkpoint in HeLa cells and a G1/S
checkpoint arrest in hTERT-RPE1 cells [24]. To analyze
whether this difference in pRb is also the reason for the
different response of HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 cells after
SBE13 and SAHA treatment we analyzed pRb protein in
both cell types. HeLa cells showed pRb staining in all
control cells with some variation in signal intensity in
individual nuclei (Figure 4D, upper panel). After SBE13,
SAHA and the combinatorial treatment the pRb staining
pattern stayed essentially the same (Figure 4D, lower
three panels). In striking contrast, hTERT-RPE1 control
cells displayed many nuclei showing strong staining, and
some cells with very low pRb levels (Figure 4E, upper
panel). After treatment with SBE13 or SAHA alone
and after the combinatorial treatment pRb staining was
strongly diminished in all nuclei (Figure 4E, lower three
panels). These observations suggest a functional p21/pRbmediated G1/S checkpoint in hTERT-RPE1 as a cause
for the differences in cell proliferation and apoptosis
induction (see below) after the treatments in comparison
to HeLa cells.
In addition, we analyzed p21 protein to investigate
potential differences in localization or induction/reduction
in HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 cells (Figure 4D, 4E). We
detected p21 protein in HeLa cells mainly within the nuclei
(Figure 4D, upper panel). In contrast, after SBE13 treatment
p21 was localized preferentially within the cytoplasm
(Figure 4D, second panel). After SAHA treatment, alone or
in combination with SBE13, we detected p21 throughout
the whole cell without the strong cytoplasmic enrichment
as observed for SBE13 alone. hTERT-RPE1 cells did
not show this treatment-induced differential p21 (re)
localization but was predominantly detectable in the nuclei
of these immortalized cells (Figure 4E).

To confirm the real-time PCR data concerning
reduced Plk1 mRNA by SAHA treatment and thus to
confirm the proposed involvement of transcriptional
regulation of Plk1 by HDAC inhibitors, we did Western
blot analyses after incubation of HeLa and hTERT-RPE1
cells with SAHA together with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (Figure 3A, 3B). We observed in both cell types
that SAHA reduced Plk1 protein levels very strongly,
and that MG132 inhibits the proteasomal degradation of
Plk1 demonstrated by strong enrichment after MG132
treatment. But the combination of SAHA with MG132
reduced Plk1 protein compared to MG132 treatment alone,
which is a further hint that the reduction of Plk1 protein
after SAHA treatment is due to the observed regulation
on Plk1 transcription by SAHA and not due to enhanced
protein stability.
In addition, we analyzed p21 protein levels
after SAHA treatment in combination with MG132 in
HeLa cells, and it is obvious that MG132 inhibits the
proteasomal degradation of p21, but it is only slightly
induced after SAHA treatment with MG132 compared to
MG132 alone (Figure 3C).

Cell cycle analysis of HeLa, hTERT-RPE1
and NIH-3T3 cells after treatment with SAHA
and SBE13
We did FACS analyses to determine the cell cycle
distribution of HeLa, hTERT-RPE1, and NIH-3T3 cells
to examine whether the changes in Plk1 and HDAC
activity were associated with an arrest in particular stages
of the cell cycle and if these cell cycle arrests are timedependent. In addition, we wanted to figure out whether
the absence or presence of a functional G1/S checkpoint
influences the cell cycle arrest.
First, we analyzed HeLa cells and observed an
increase of cells in G2/M phase after treatment with
SAHA alone and a very prominent increase of cells
in G2/M phase and in S phase while G0/G1 phase is

43% with 2.5 μM SAHA (p = 0.003), to 20% with 5 μM

0.001) and to 10% with 10 μM SAHA (p = 0.004) (Figure
6B). The combination with SBE13 showed a slightly
stronger effect on cell proliferation (10 μM SBE13 +
100 nM SAHA reduction to 84%, p = 0.06, SBE13 + 500
nM SAHA reduction to 74%, p = 0.08, SBE13 + 1 μM
SAHA reduction to 45%, p = 0.007, SBE13 + 2.5 μM
SAHA reduction to 21%, p = 0.003, and SBE13 + 5 μM
SAHA reduction to 9%, p = 0.001). This combination
was synergistic with a c.i. value of 0.5, thus much less
than in the HeLa cancer cells. NIH-3T3 cells showed
already a very strong reduction of cell proliferation after
single SAHA administration (Figure 6C) with a reduction
to 70% with 1 μM, p = 0.003, to 22% with 2.5 μM,
p < 0.001, to 9% with 5 μM, p < 0.001, and to 2% with
10 μM SAHA, p < 0.001. The combination with 10 μM
SBE13 led to slightly stronger reduced cell proliferation:
together with 100 or 500 nM SAHA, respectively,
proliferation was not reduced compared to control cells
(reduction to 89%, p = 0.138 or 0.07, respectively), with
1 μM SAHA to 80%, p = 0.003, with 2.5 μM to 28%,
p < 0.001, and with 5 μM SAHA 14%, p = 0.001. This
reduction of cell proliferation was even not synergistic,
but antagonistic (c.i. = 1.23).

Cell proliferation analysis after treatment with
SAHA and SBE13 in HeLa, hTERT-RPE1
and NIH-3T3 cells
To investigate whether the cell cycle arrest
and induction of apoptosis causes a reduction of cell
proliferation, we analyzed the cell proliferation of the
various cell lines after treatment with SAHA alone and in
combination with SBE13 (Figure 6).
HeLa cells showed a slightly reduced cell proliferation
to levels of 83% with 500 nM SAHA and to 51% with 1 μM
SAHA (Figure 6A). The reduction was significant with 2.5
μM SAHA (65%, p = 0.04) and with 5 and 10 μM SAHA
(26%, p = 0.02 and 4%, p = 0.008, respectively) (Figure
6A). In combination with 1 μM SBE13 we observed a
significant reduction already with 500 nM SAHA (53%, p
= 0.01). Together with 1 μM SAHA to 39%, p = 0.01, with
2.5 μM SAHA to 10%, p = 0.008, and with 5 μM SAHA to
6%, p = 0.008. This stronger reduction in combination was
synergistic with a c.i. value of 0.21.

and induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells, hTERTRPE1 cells and in mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells.
From earlier studies it is known that Plk1 depletion
leads to different effects in cancer vs. non-cancer cells,
and thus we analyzed this combination in cancer and

non-cancer cells to confirm these differential effects
[18, 21, 24, 34].
First we wanted to point out whether SAHA
influences Plk1 transcription or protein stability. Our
quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses
revealed a regulation of Plk1 at the transcriptional
level by SAHA, because in cancer and non-cancer
cells Plk1 mRNA levels were statistically significantly
reduced by SAHA (alone and in combination with
SBE13). As expected, the combination of SAHA with
SBE13 did not alter Plk1 transcript levels compared
to SAHA alone. To rule out an influence of increased
proteasomal degradation we did Western blot analyses
using MG132-treated cells, but also after addition
of MG132 Plk1 levels decreased following SAHA
treatment compared to controls treated with MG132
alone. This observation is in concordance with the
observation of Noh et al. regarding a down-regulation
of Plk1 transcripts by Trichostatin A [25]. Indeed, Plk1
is a target of the Rb pathway via SWI/SNF-dependent
histone deacetylation of the Plk1 promoter which can
explain these effects [35].
This fact motivated us to analyze pRb and p21.
Our Western blot analyses revealed a differential effect
between cancer and non-cancer cells concerning p21
induction and apoptosis induction. HeLa cells showed
a strong induction of p21 protein expression and Parp
cleavage as well as Caspase 3 activation, while hTERTRPE1 cells showed no p21 or apoptosis induction. In
contrast to cancer cells non-transformed cells have higher
basal levels of p21 as it is known that lacking of p21
leads to tumorigenesis [36]. Taking into account that we
observed in earlier studies using SBE13 in HeLa cells a
G2/M arrest and in hTERT-RPE1 cells a transient G0/
G1 arrest [24], we assume that the differences between
HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 are due to a functional G1/S
checkpoint in hTERT-RPE1 cells and to the function of
p21 as well at the G1/S and the G2/M transition [37, 38].
Another explanation for the different effects in cancer
and non-cancer cells could be the localization of p21:
it is well-known that cytoplasmic localization of p21
leads to an inhibition of Caspase 3 activation and thus to
reduced apoptosis induction, and that p21 has a dual role
as oncogene or tumor suppressor gene dependent on its
localization [37, 39, 40]. If p21 is localized in the nucleus
it works as a tumor suppressor, and in the cytoplasm as
an oncoprotein [40]. We detected p21 in hTERT-RPE1
cells exclusively in the nuclei, supporting its role as
tumor suppressor especially in cells with functional
checkpoints. Due to this localization p21 can contribute
to DNA repair, induction of cell cycle arrest and work as
transcriptional cofactor [40]. In contrast, in HeLa cells we
found a stronger cytoplasmic localization after treatment
supporting its role as an oncoprotein and confirming
earlier studies from other groups showing cytoplasmic
enrichment of p21 after Plk1 inhibition [40] and thus
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

leading to a prevention of apoptosis induction in cancer
cells [39, 41]. After addition of SAHA or SAHA together
with SBE13 p21 was found within the whole cell, losing
its ability to prevent cells from apoptosis.
The fact that HeLa cells induce p21 after
treatment with an HDAC inhibitor and hTERT-RPE1
cells do not, in combination with the observation that
HeLa cells induce apoptosis while hTERT-RPE1 cells
do not, is in concordance with Papeleu et al., who
report that hepatoma cells show an upregulation of
p21, accompanied by increasing Caspase 3 activity
and subsequent apoptosis induction, while primary
hepatocytes do not show this p21 induction and they
do not show an activation of Caspase 3 and no signs of
cell death [42]. Another publication corroborates the
observation that NIH-3T3 cells show a slight induction
of p21 after DNA damage, although these are non-cancer
cells, because it is described that this increase can occur
also in normal untransformed cells [37].
Additionally, it is known that p21 prevents Plk1
expression via direct binding of the Plk1 promoter, which
may be part of an adaptive stress response [43]. Thus,
generally, p21 contributes to G1 phase arrest via inhibition
of Cyclin E, Cyclin A/Cdk activity and thus leaving Rb
hypo-phosphorylated and sequestering E2F, whose activity
is necessary for S phase entry [37]. This fits perfectly
with our observation that hTERT-RPE1 cells show hypophosphorylated Rb protein after treatment with SBE13
and / or SAHA.
Our study is also consistent with observations
identifying L-Carnitine as an endogenous HDACi,
which selectively induced cytotoxic effects in cancer
cells although it inhibited HDAC activity also in primary
cells [44]. This confirms our observation that SAHA
reduces Plk1 transcript and protein levels in both cancer
and primary cells, but induces p21 and apoptosis, holds
up phosphorylation of the Rb protein, leads to G2/M
enrichment and to strongly reduced cell proliferation only
in cancer cells, but not in non-cancer cells.
The current study provides another hint for the
importance of an intact G1/S checkpoint in primary versus
cancer cells for a differential effect in cancer therapy as
observed in earlier studies [24]. Here, we could show for
the first time, that the p21 protein localizes in hTERTRPE1 cells mainly in the nucleus (in control and treated
cells) confirming its role as a tumor suppressor gene [45].
In HeLa cells, in contrast, we observed many cells with
cytoplasmic localization of p21, contributing to its known
role as an oncoprotein, preventing apoptosis induction in
HeLa cells in the absence of additional stresses. Addition
of SAHA and SBE13 led to cell death of HeLa cells
confirming the synergistic reduction of cell proliferation
in contrast to non-cancer cells. Thus, p21 can execute its
function as a tumor suppressor and G1/S regulator only
in non-cancer cells, making it an interesting target for
potential therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany). Thereafter, 50 ng cDNA were
subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analyses
targeting Plk1 and GAPDH using the FastStart Universal
Probe Master ROX and Universal ProbeLibrary #30
(Plk1) and #60 (GAPDH) (Roche Applied Biosciences,
Mannheim, Germany). Primer sequences were chosen
as suggested by Roche Applied Biosciences (Mannheim,
Germany): Plk1 forward 5′-cacagtgtcaatgcctccaa,
Plk1
reverse
5′-ttgctgacccagaagatgg,
GAPDH
forward 5′-agccacatcgctcagacac, GAPDH reverse
5′-gcccaatacgaccaaatcc. Analysis was performed using
the StepOne Plus RealTime PCR System and the StepOne
v2.2.3 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany). Relative gene expression values were
determined by the ΔΔCT method using the StepOne v2.3
software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).
Data are presented as the fold difference in Plk1
expression normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH
as endogenous reference, and relative to the untreated
control cells.

Kinase and HDAC inhibitors and antibodies
The Plk1 kinase inhibitor SBE13 was purchased
from the SPECS compound catalogue (Delft, Netherlands),
the HDAC inhibitor SAHA was from Selleck (Absource
Diagnostics GmbH München, Germany).
Monoclonal-anti-Plk1,
monoclonal-anti-ProCaspase 3, goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., (Heidelberg, Germany), rabbit anti-phosphoRb antibody was from abcam (Cambridge, UK),
monoclonal-anti-p21 and rabbit-anti-Parp antibodies
were from Cell Signaling (Frankfurt/Main, Germany) and
monoclonal β-actin-antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany). Monoclonal p21-antibody
for immunofluorescence was from BD Biosciences
(Heidelberg, Germany). Cy3-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG F(ab’)2-fragment antibody was from Dianova
(Hamburg, Germany) and Alexa488-conjugated goatanti-mouse antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories (Baltimore, USA).

Western blot analysis
Total protein (50 μg) was separated on 10% BisTris-polyacrylamide gels and transferred (at 30 V for
1 hr) to Immobilon™-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford,
MA) according to the Invitrogen protocol (Karlsruhe,
Germany). Membranes were incubated for 1 hr in 5%
powdered nonfat milk in PBS with antibodies against
Plk1 (1:200), Pro-Caspase 3 (1:1,000), p21 (1:2,000),
pRb (1:2,000), Parp (1:1,000) or β-actin (1:100,000) and
for 30 min in 5% nonfat dry milk with goat anti-mouse
or goat anti-rabbit serum (1:2,000) and visualized as
described [21].
All protein expression levels were presented as
described [21], scanned and quantified with the freeware
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA).

Cell culture
HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells were from DSMZ
(Braunschweig, Germany), hTERT-RPE1 cells were from
Clontech (Saint-Germain-en Laye, France). All cells
were cultured according to the supplier’s instructions
without antibiotics. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from PAA
Laboratories (Cölbe, Germany), MEM, DMEM, DMEM
F12, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), glutamine, and
trypsin were from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany).

Treatment and analysis of cells
Cells were treated with SBE13 and SAHA alone or in
combination one day after subculturing. Cells were seeded
onto 6-well-plates, or 75-cm2- flasks, respectively. Control
cells were incubated with normal culture medium without
antibiotics. Concentrations of SBE13 were 1 μM for cancer
cells and 10 μM for non-cancer cells, respectively, SAHA
concentrations ranged from 0.1–10 μM. The growth rate of
5 × 104 cells per 6-well was determined by counting cells
at 24 to 72 hours after treatment using a hematocytometer.
Cell culture studies were performed in triplicate for
each time point. Cells were harvested 24–72 hours after
treatment for further analyses.

FACS analysis
Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a
FACScalibur apparatus (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg,
Germany). Quantification was carried out using ModFit
LT 3.3 for Windows (Verity Software House, Topsham,
ME). For FACS analysis, cells were harvested at the
indicated time points, washed with PBS, fixed and stained
as described [46]. For each experiment, 30, 000 cells were
analyzed in triplicate.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis

Immunofluorescence analysis

After isolation of total RNA using RNeasy
mini-kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol 24 hrs after incubation with SAHA
alone or together with SBE13, respectively, the mRNA
was transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity

Immunofluorescence optical sectioning microscopy
was performed on an AxioObserver microscope equipped
with a ApoTome.2 structured illumination unit using a
63x/1.4 NA oil immersion Plan-Apochromat objective
(Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). DAPI, Alexa488 and Cy3

dyes were excited through dye-specific optical filters at
335–383 nm, 450–490 nm and 538–562 nm, respectively at
50% constant output of a HXP120 fluorescence excitation
light source. DAPI, Alexa488 and Cy3 fluorescence
was captured with dye-specific band pass filters at 420–
470 nm, 500–550 nm and 570–640 nm, respectively.
Beamsplitters at 395 nm, 495 nm, and 570 nm were used,
respectively. There was no bleedthrough or cross-talk in
the triple-fluorescence staining experiments using these
filter combinations. Each dye was scanned independently
in multitracking mode. Optical sections were acquired for
each color channel at mid-nucleus postion after selection
in the z-axis using an Axiocam 503 mono camera (Zeiss) at
1936 × 1460 pixels (72 nm per pixel). Acquisition settings
(exposure times) were kept constant for all images and
were as follows: 200 ms for DAPI, 1 s for Alexa 488 and
500 ms for Cy3. Optical sections with an axial resolution
of 720 nm (DAPI), 790 nm (Alexa488) and 880 nm (Cy3)
were achieved through structured illumination employing 3
phase images without any normalization, phase correction,
Fourier filtering or deconvolution.
ZEN 2 pro software (Carl Zeiss) was used for image
acquisition, display and export as TIF files. Micrographs
were assembled from TIF files using Photoshop software.
We analyzed phospho-Rb to analyze the G1/S
checkpoint control and p21 localization. DNA was stained with
2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride
(DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Polyclonal
anti-pRb antibodies were used at a 1:250 dilution in 1%
BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in PBS, p21
antibodies at a 1:100 dilution in 1% in PBS.

All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.
All treatments were compared with untreated control cells.
Statistical analysis was performed with student’s t-test
and ANOVA to consider random effects as described [21].
EC50 values were calculated from the cell proliferation
experiments assuming the cell number of control cells at
the latest time point as 100%.
The combination index was calculated using the
following equation: c.i. = (Am)50/(As)50 + (Bm)50/(Bs)50,
where (Am)50 is the concentration of drug A necessary to
achieve a 50% inhibitory effect (IC50) in the combination,
(As)50 is the concentration of the same drug that will
produce the identical level of effect alone, (Bm)50 is the
IC50 of drug B in the combination and (Bs)50 is the IC50
of drug B after single administration. Antagonism is
indicated when c.i. > 1, c.i. = 1 indicates an additive effect
and a c.i. < 1 indicates synergy [47].
