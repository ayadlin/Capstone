ABSTRACT
Mounting evidence has indicated microRNA (miR) dysregulation and the Wnt/
β-catenin signaling pathway jointly drive carcinogenesis, cancer metastasis, and
drug-resistance. The current review will focus on the role of the crosstalk between
miRs and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cancer development. MiRs were
found to activate or inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway at various steps. On the other
hand, Wnt activation increases expression of miR by directly binding to its promoter
and activating transcription. Moreover, there are mutual feedback loops between
some miRs and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Clinical trials of miR-based
therapeutic agents are investigated for solid and hematological tumors, however,
challenges concerning low bioavailability and possible side effects must be overcome
before the final clinical application. This review will describe current understanding
of miR crosstalk with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. Better understanding of
the regulatory network will provide insight into miR-based therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION

MiRs overview

MiR, as an evolutionarily conserved gene expression
regulator, participates in many fundamental physiological
processes. In cancer development, miR functions as a
tumor suppressor or an oncogene by targeting specific
genes in a 3’UTR dependent manner. This mechanism
occurs in a variety of tumors. It is well known that Wnt/
β-catenin drives the carcinogenesis, cancer progression,
and metastasis in many tumors. Emerging evidence has
indicated the importance of interaction between the Wnt/
β-catenin signaling pathway (Wnt pathway for short) and
miR mediated gene regulation in cancer development.
In this paper, we would like to summarize current
understanding of the crosstalk between miRs and the Wnt
pathway with respect to oncogenesis, cancer metastasis,
and drug-resistance.

MiRs are short (18-25 nucleotides) non-coding
RNAs. They repress gene expression through interaction
with the 3’UTR of target genes, either inhibiting mRNA
translation and/or promoting mRNA degradation. One miR
family is potentially able to target 500 genes on average
[1]. Likewise, approximately 60% of the mRNAs can be
targeted by one or multiple miRs [1]. For example, miR34 was identified as targeting a number of genes including
WNT1/3, β-catenin, LRP6, LEF1, AXIN2, TCF7 posttranscriptionally [2]. MiR-145, -133a and -133b were
found to target gene FSCN1 to inhibit cell proliferation
and invasion [3]. Thus, changing the expression of miRs
will impact a cascade of modifications in gene expression.

MiRs in cancer

Canonical Wnt pathway in cancer

Genome-wide profiling has shown that miRs are
frequently aberrantly expressed in human neoplasms
including gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
breast cancer, glioblastoma, prostate cancer and colorectal
cancer (CRC) [2]. Software prediction in combination
with experimental validation showed that miRs are
involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and
chemo-resistance by directly targeting specific oncogenes
or tumor suppressors. For example, let-7c was shown to
be down-regulated in gastric cancer, which was related
to Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis
[4]. MiR-194 was identified to promote angiogenesis
by suppressing the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor
thrombospondin1 in colon cancer [5]. MiR-21, one of the
most well studied miRs, was found to be overexpressed in
a wide variety of tumors including glioblastoma, colon,
breast, and gastric cancers, leading to enhanced cell
invasion and metastasis [6]. In addition, miRs can be used
as diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic factors. Based
on a meta-analysis, the circulating miR-21 expression
is a useful noninvasive biological marker for the earlier
detection of digestive system cancers such as CRC, HCC,
gastric cancer, and a promising prognostic marker for
digestive system cancers in the Asian population [7].

Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway is highly
associated with tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. Wnt
signaling components are commonly mutated in many
human cancers. Exome-sequencing has revealed that most
of CRC patients harbor loss of function mutations in APC
[10]. In some CRC patients, Axin2 is mutated [11], or
β-catenin has activating point mutations [12]. A rare but
recurrent fusion between VTI1A and TCF7L2, the gene
encoding TCF4, has also been found in CRC patients
[13]. In CRC and a host of other cancers, Wnt signaling
components are mutated. Oncogenic β-catenin mutations
are present in melanoma, HCC, gastric, pancreas, ovarian,
and endometrial cancers (reviewed in [14]). Inactivating
mutations of Axin were observed in HCC [15]. In addition
to germline/somatic mutations, aberrant activation of Wnt
pathway can result from epigenetic modifications, such
as miR regulation. We will discuss this in detail in later
sections.

CROSSTALK BETWEEN MIR AND THE
WNT PATHWAY
Dysregulation of miR induces constitutively active
Wnt signaling activity in cancer, while expression of miR,
in turn, is intensely controlled by Wnt signaling. In order
to identify miRs that regulate the Wnt pathway activity,
470 miRs were screened in a cell-based assay in human
HEK293 cells and 38 candidate miRs were identified [16].
MiRs activate or repress the Wnt pathway at multiple
levels by targeting Wnt ligand/receptor and ligand/receptor
associated proteins, β-catenin, β-catenin interacting
complex, Wnt pathway transcription factors, multiple
Wnt signaling pathway components and components in
other signaling pathways (Figure 1). Meanwhile, Wnt
activation increases expression of miR through binding
of β-catenin to TCF/LEF which then binds to promoter
regions to activate transcription. Moreover, there are
mutual feedback loops between some miRs and Wnt
signaling components. In summary, Wnt activation and
miR mediated gene regulation are reciprocal causation to
drive oncogenesis.

Canonical Wnt pathway overview
The Wnt pathway is critical for embryo
development and adult tissue homeostasis. Without
Wnt protein stimulation, β-catenin is anchored by a
destruction complex comprised of APC, GSK3β and
Axin [8]. β-catenin is phosphorylated by CK1α and
GSK3β, followed by ubiquitination by β-TRCP, resulting
in β-catenin proteasomal degradation. The activation of
the pathway initiates from the Wnt proteins binding to the
receptor Frizzled (FZD) and co-receptor LDL receptorrelated protein (LRP) 5 or LRP6. Ligand binding to the
receptor leads to the phosphorylation of Dishevelled
(DVL). Phosphorylated DVL recruits AXIN and GSK3β to
the cell membrane, thereby, inhibiting the phosphorylation
of β-catenin and allowing β-catenin to dissociate from the
destruction complex. Next, the β-catenin that accumulates
localizes to the nucleus and interacts with the TCF/LEF
to transactivate downstream gene expression including
CyclinD, c-Myc, CD44. Wnt signaling can be suppressed
by antagonist molecules such as Wnt inhibitory factor 1
(WIF1), secreted frizzled-related protein family (sFRP)
and Dickkopf (DKK) (reviewed in [9]).

MiRs modulate the Wnt pathway
Targeting Wnt ligands/receptors and ligands/receptors
associated inhibitory proteins
It is well established that Wnt activation initiates
from the Wnt proteins binding to the FZD and LRP5 or
LRP6. If miRs target the Wnt ligand/ receptor such as
WNT, FZD and LRP, the pathway is repressed. Both miR122 and -148a were found to be down-regulated in HCC
and to repress the Wnt pathway by targeting WNT1. MiR14090

For example, miR-1 and -100 were identified to suppress
breast cancer progression by inhibiting the Wnt pathway
through targeting the FZD7 and FZD8 respectively [27,
28]. MiR-513c was found to suppress glioblastoma cell
proliferation predominantly through direct suppression of
the expression of LRP6 [29].

Conversely, Wnt signaling is activated when miRs
target Wnt antagonists such as WIF, sFRP, DKK, and PR
domain proteins (PRDM). MiR-374a [30, 31], -603 [32]
-1260b [33], -328 [34] were discovered to activate Wnt/βcatenin signaling by targeting antagonists WIF1 or sFRP1.

by binding to the LRP5/LRP6. MiR-29a [35], -372&373
[36], -21 [37] and -92b [38] were found to enhance the
Wnt pathway activity via targeting DKK, which resulted
in either accelerating cancer cell proliferation/invasion
or inducing resistance to chemotherapy. Additional
examples of miR regulating Wnt ligands/receptors and
their associated inhibitory proteins are listed in Table 1
and Figure 1.
The Wnt receptor is at the crux between
extracellular ligands and intracellular responses such
as survival or apoptosis, proliferation or growth arrest,
drug susceptibility or drug resistance. Thus targeting the
receptor and its associated proteins by miRs fundamentally
influences signaling transduction at the initiation phase. As
discussed, miR regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade
is multi-faceted with regards to receptor activation and
warrants interest for possible therapeutic interventions.

targets which are elements of the Wnt pathway. These
genes include WNT1/3, β-catenin, LRP6, AXIN2 and
LEF1 [55-59]. The inactivating mutation of p53 turns on
canonical Wnt signaling and enhances EMT by inducing
miR-34 mediated reduction of target gene expression in
human cancer.
β-catenin is the central and most well studied
signaling molecule in the Wnt pathway. By targeting
β-catenin, miRs directly repress the Wnt signaling activity
(Figure 1 and Table 2). Moreover, miR-34s are able to
target a number of Wnt signaling components, allowing
efficient regulation of important physiological functions
associated with cancer initiation and progression. This is
a very appealing property for therapy development. As a
result, a miR mimic targeting miR-34 was developed into
a therapeutic (MRX34) and is in a phase 1 clinical trial for
solid and hematological tumors [60].

Targeting β-catenin

Targeting β-catenin-interacting complex

β-catenin, the most important signaling factor
in the Wnt pathway, transduces the signal by directly
binding to TCF/LEF transcription factors and turning
on downstream gene expressions which promote cell
proliferation, migration, EMT, cancer cell metastasis and
chemo-resistance [9]. A number of miRs have been found
to suppress the Wnt pathway by modulating β-catenin. The
well-studied miR-200 cluster is usually under-expressed in
cancer cells and is identified to target β-catenin to inhibit
cancer progression [39-45]. Five members are included in
the family: miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141 and -429. MiR200a was identified to be reduced in meningioma, HCC,
and gastric cancer [39-43]. This decrease blocked the Wnt
pathway by two mechanisms: it targeted the 3’-UTR of
β-catenin and the EMT transcription factors zinc finger
E-box binding homeobox 1/2 (ZEB1/2). The resulting
effect was the reduction of β-catenin and inhibition of Wnt
signaling. MiR-200c was shown to repress Wnt pathway
by targeting β-catenin directly in breast cancer [44]. MiR200b was established to have suppressive effects on the
proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of glioma
cells via targeting ZEB2 [46]. Moreover, miR-141 was
also found to suppress β-catenin expression in breast
cancer [45] and down-regulate SOX17 expression, causing
activation of Wnt signaling in esophageal cancer [47].
Many other miRs target β-catenin as well, besides
the miR-200 family. MiR-214 [48, 49], -320 [50], -101
[51], -1826 [52, 53], -548b [30], and -33a [54], were
found to block Wnt pathway by targeting the 3’UTR of
β-catenin in HCC, prostate, breast, colon, urological, and
lung cancer, respectively (Figure 1 and Table 2).
Certain miRs not only target β-catenin alone, but
also directly suppress a set of multiple components of the
Wnt signaling cascade to regulate Wnt activity such as
miR-34. MiR-34 trans-activated by p53 inhibits the Wnt
pathway by targeting the 3’-UTRs of a set of conserved

Due to the significance of β-catenin in Wnt
signaling, miRs targeting the β-catenin interacting
proteins such as APC, GSKβ, AXIN and similar
associates, consequently regulate Wnt signaling. APC is a
scaffolding protein for the APC/GSK3β/CK1α/β-catenin/
AXIN complex which mediates destruction of β-catenin.
It is a common tumor suppressor, mutated in a variety of
cancers. MiR-155 has been reported to negatively regulate
APC in multiple carcinomas including HCC and papillary
thyroid carcinoma [61, 62] to promote cell proliferation
and tumorigenesis. These data suggest miR-155 as a
promising target for diagnosis and treatment of HCC and
papillary thyroid cancer.
In regard to the kinase in the “destruction complex”,
GSK-3β was targeted by miR-26a as revealed in target
prediction and validated in biological experiments. MiR26a targets GSK-3β to promote cholangiocarcinoma
growth through concomitant activation of Wnt/β-catenin
[63]. GSK-3β is also a target of miR-1290 in lung cancer
[64].
Another scaffolding protein in the “destruction
complex”, AXIN2 is targeted by miR-544a. MiR-544a was
identified as an EMT-inducing miR in a cell-based reporter
system with a 328-miRs library. In gastric cancer, it targets
E-cadherin and AXIN2 to promote β-catenin translocation
to the nucleus, resulting in active Wnt signaling [65].
It suggests that miR-544a might be a potential target
for treating advanced gastric cancer. Additional miRs
targeting β-catenin associated factors are listed in Table
2 and Figure 1.
In summary, miRs regulate the Wnt pathway by
targeting β-catenin directly and by inhibiting expression
of β-catenin interacting proteins, revealing a regulatory
network that is intertwined and complicated.

promote cancer advancement [69]. HBP1, a transcriptional
repressor for the Wnt pathway, is also targeted by miR17-5p to activate Wnt signaling to promote cell migration
and invasion in breast cancer [70]. RUNX3 (Runt
related transcription factor 3) forms a ternary complex
with β-catenin/TCF4 to inhibit Wnt signaling activity
[71]. Elevated expression of miR-130a may directly
repress RUNX3 to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and
subsequently lead to chemo-resistance in HCC cells [72].
NLK (Nemo-like kinase), an evolutionarily
conserved protein kinase, is an inhibitor for the Wnt
pathway by binding to and phosphorylating TCF/LEF-1
family proteins [73]. MiR-92b was identified to promote
glioma proliferation and invasion by targeting NLK which
resulted in active Wnt/β-catenin signaling [74]. More
recently, miR-197 was reported to activate Wnt signaling
by downregulation of NLK in ovarian cancer [75].
Collectively, research has documented the
involvement of miRs in regulating the Wnt pathway at
the last checkpoint-mRNA expression. Transcriptional

The established action mechanism of β-catenin is
activation of downstream gene expression by binding
the transcriptional factor TCF/LEF. MiRs that target the
TCF/LEF transcription factors and other associated coactivators/co-repressors regulate transcription transduced
by Wnt signaling (Figure 1 and Table 2). For example,
miR-218 inhibits glioblastoma cell invasiveness by
suppressing the Wnt pathway via direct targeting of
oncogenic transcription factor LEF1 [66]. MiR-139
attenuates the proliferative and invasive ability of HCC
by inhibiting the Wnt pathway through TCF4 [67].
Other transcriptional factors and co-activators/
co-repressors besides the TCF family are modulated by
miRs to affect Wnt signaling. P130 is a transcription factor
associated with GSK3β which sequesters β-catenin in an
inactive form as a P130/GSK3β/β-catenin complex in
the cell nucleus [68]. It was found that P130 is targeted
by miR-17-5p to activate the Wnt pathway in CRC to

expression and by inhibition of the formation of the
active TCF/β-catenin complex. Thus, miR regulation
of transcription adds another layer of fine tuning the
signaling cascade.

potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer [86].
Take another transcription factor for example,
smad4 is an important transcription factor for TGFβ
signaling which participates in multiple biological
processes including cell survival, apoptosis, growth and
differentiation. For the TGFβ/Smad pathway, smad4,
smad7 and TGFβ are targeted by miR-182-5p [77], miR93 [87] and miR-21 [37] in bladder cancer, CRC, and
colon cancer respectively.

Targeting components in other signaling pathways
More recently, the crosstalk between Wnt signaling
and other signaling pathways has been described in more
detail. A great number of miRs have been found to regulate
the Wnt signaling pathway indirectly by targeting elements
in other pathways (Table 3). The function of components
from other signaling pathways varied from one to another.
They can be classified into three major groups. The largest
group comprises transcriptional factors such as E2F1
[76], smad [77] and ZEB [78]. The next set is the group
of enzymes including Phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) [79], and Zinc and Ring Finger 3 (ZNRF3) [80].
The final group involves the receptor associated proteins
such as Roundabout 3 (ROBO3) [81] and Solute Carrier
Family 34 Member 2 ( SLC34A2) [82].

Targeting enzymes in other signaling pathways
In addition to transcription factors, miR regulates
Wnt signaling indirectly by targeting enzymes in other
signaling pathways. PTEN, a critical enzymatic protein in
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, was found to be targeted
by miR-301a [79] and miR-429 [88] in breast cancer and
HCC respectively. It was shown that up-regulated miR301a accelerates breast cancer progression by targeting
PTEN, consequently resulting in Wnt signaling activation.
The study suggests that miR-301a may be a potential
therapeutic target for breast cancer. MiR-429 increases the
metastatic capability of HCC by activating both Wnt and
PI3K signaling through PTEN, suggesting miR-429 as a
novel target for HCC treatment.
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) catalyzes
the methylation of histone H3 in target gene promoters
to repress gene expression. It regulates cell proliferation,
migration, metastasis, and chemo-resistance by silencing
tumor suppressor genes such as APC [89-91]. EZH2
overexpression leads to activation of the Wnt pathway via
APC reduction. EZH2 was reported to be targeted by miR506 [92] and miR-144 [93] in colon and bladder cancer
respectively. MiR-506 abrogates tumor proliferation and
metastasis in colon cancer and miR-144 decreases cell
growth in bladder cancer via Wnt pathway inhibition.
In another example, ZNRF3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
inhibits Wnt pathway by increasing proteolysis of FZD
and LRP6 [94]. It was reported that miR-146b-5p induces
EMT and may promote papillary thyroid cancer metastasis
through Wnt pathway activation by targeting ZNRF3.
MiR-93 was also found to target ZNRF3 to promote lung
carcinoma growth through Wnt signaling activation [95].

Targeting transcription factors in other signaling
pathways
Transcription factor E2F1 preferentially binds
to retinoblastoma protein pRB to prevent cell-cycle
progression. It mediates p53-dependent/independent
apoptosis. E2F1 was shown to suppress the Wnt pathway
by trans-activating Catenin Beta Interacting Protein 1
(CTNNBIP1) [76] or by up-regulating AXIN2 [83].
MiR-19b/20a/92a was found to sustain the stem cell selfrenewal and promote cell proliferation in gastric cancer by
increasing Wnt signaling through reduction of E2F1 and
dishevelled-associated protein1 (HIPK1) expression [84].
Myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) is a
transcription factor of the MEF2 family. The family
members were found to be involved in carcinogenesis and
cancer progression [85]. MiR-19 inhibits cell proliferation
in gastric cancer by targeting MEF2D. MEF2D inhibition
leads to repression of the Wnt pathway. The miR-19/
MEF2D/Wnt/β-catenin axis is critical for gastric cancer
cell survival and proliferation, suggesting miR-19 as a

distinctively expressed miRs in tumors resulting from
loss of function mutation of APC. MiR-215 and -137 are
repressed and miR-708, -135b and -31 levels are increased
in APC mutation induced tumors. Target prediction and
pathway analysis suggest that these miRs control signaling
pathways critical for transformation [98]. Conversely, the
expression profile of miRs was explored in TCF activity
disrupted cells [99]. The miR transcriptome was assessed
with the TaqMan Array in DLD1 CRC cells expressing
dominant negative (dn) TCF4 alleles. Fifty-one miRs
were found to be upregulated and 9 downregulated by at
least two fold in dnTCF4 cells. Sixteen of the increased
miRNAs, such as miR-574-3p,-139-5p and -30e-3p, were
shown to be markedly reduced in CRC tissue. Some
selected miRs (miR-30e-3p -145, -139-5p and -126)
significantly suppress cell proliferation. Consistently,
miR-30e is trans-activated by β-catenin/TCF4 complex
during intestinal cell differentiation in rat [100]. In
another study, a bioinformatics approach with ChIP-PCR
was utilized to discover that TCF4 trans-activates miR-21
by directly binding to its promoter in colon cancer cells
[101]. Similarly, miR-21 is trans-activated by β-catenin
in a STAT3 dependent manner to promote cell invasion
in glioma [102]. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling is the
driving force for CRC carcinogenesis and progression.
These identified downstream miRs of the Wnt pathway
reveal part of the mechanisms through which Wnt/βcatenin promotes CRC tumorigenesis.
Other than CRC, 30% of gastric cancers carry
nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, highlighting the
importance of the Wnt pathway in gastric oncogenesis.
To identify the miRs regulated by Wnt signaling, a miR
microarray was conducted with β-catenin interference in
gastric cancer cells to detect expression differences in the
miR transcriptome [103]. The expression of miRs-4739,
-210, -135b-5p, and-1234-3p are significantly increased
and that of miRs-23b-5p, -20a-3p, -423-5p, -455-3p and
-335-3p are significantly decreased. β-catenin interference
results in delayed cell proliferation, increased apoptosis,
weakened invasion of gastric cancer cells, and increased
chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells. Also in gastric cancer,
Wang et al. have demonstrated that miR-122a, a new
tumor suppressor, is down-regulated by Wnt/β-catenin
signaling [104]. The down-regulation of miR-122a
mediated by aberrant Wnt pathwaysignaling is critical for
the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal cancer.
Additionally, several studies explored the underlying
mechanisms of HCC progression from the perspective
of Wnt signaling, as β-catenin is a major oncogene in
HCC and is activated in 30-40% of cases [105]. Wnt/βcatenin signaling was shown to up-regulate miR-770 to
promote cell proliferation in HCC [106]. Also in HCC,
Wnt signaling elevates miR-183/96/182 levels to augment
cell invasion. β-catenin was found to increase the miR183/96/182 transcription by physically interacting with
TCF complex on miR-183/96/182 promoter region

Targeting receptor associated proteins in other signaling
pathways
In addition to transcriptional factors and enzymes,
miRs also regulate the Wnt pathway by targeting receptor
associated proteins. For instance, ROBO receptors are
members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell
adhesion molecules (ICAMs). The ROBO pathway has
been implicated in cancer development and progression
[96]. The molecular mechanism by which dysregulated
ROBO signaling promotes tumor progression is not well
studied. ROBO3 was identified as a target of miR-383.
ROBO3 increases Wnt pathway activity by sequestering
sFRP to augment pancreatic cancer progression [81].
SLC34A2 is a plasma membrane protein that
mediates sodium-dependent phosphate transport.
SLC34A2 is involved in tumorigenesis. MiR-410
promotes the tumorigenesis and development of NSCLC
by down-regulating SLC34A2 and activating the Wnt
pathway. MiR-410 might be a new potential therapeutic
target for NSCLC [82].
Integrin beta-like 1 (ITGBL1), is a beta-integrin
similar protein. The function of ITGBL1 is not clear to
date. ITGBL1, targeted by miR-576-5p, inhibits NSCLC
progression by suppressing the Wnt pathway [97].
Additional examples of miRs that regulate Wnt by
targeting elements in other signaling pathways are listed
in Table 3. Wnt/β-catenin and other signaling pathways
converge at numerous nodes of the cellular regulatory
network, therefore, miRs regulate the Wnt pathway
indirectly by targeting the node proteins with differential
functions. Most of the targeted proteins are emerging
novel oncogenes or tumor suppressors thereby the specific
mechanisms by which they modulate Wnt/β-catenin
signaling are not well understood. Additional studies
revealing the regulation mechanisms will provide novel
insight into the complex regulatory network that leads to
tumorigenesis, cancer metastasis, and drug-resistance.

The Wnt pathway regulates the expression of
miRs
Thus far, it has been shown that miRs regulate
the Wnt pathway however, the reverse is true-Wnt
pathway modulates the expression of miR positively and
negatively in a variety of tumors to induce carcinogenesis,
progression, and drug resistance (Table 4). The aberrant
expression profile of miRs was in part due to the
constitutive activation of Wnt pathway in a plethora of
cancers. β-catenin enhances downstream target expression
by binding to TCF in the promoter and recruiting a panel
of co-activators to trans-activate gene transcription.
In colon cancer, Brian et al. have used quantitative
PCR arrays as well as mathematical analysis to discover

[107]. Another study found a strong correlation between
β-catenin-activating mutation and down-regulation of
miR-375 expression in HCC according to miR profiling
in hepatocellular tumors and normal liver samples [108].
In breast cancer, miR-182 is highly expressed and
is up-regulated by the Wnt pathway. The overexpression
of miR-182 increases tumorigenicity and invasiveness by
repressing RECK [109]. In addition, the expression of
miR-125b is elevated by overexpression of SNAIL in a
β-catenin dependent manner to enhance cancer stem cell
enrichment and chemo-resistance in breast cancer [110].
This suggests that miR-125 may serve as a novel target to
overcome chemo-resistance in cancer cells. Lastly, let-7
miR was discovered to be repressed by Wnt pathway via
trans-activating Lin28 in breast cancer stem cells [111].
It was demonstrated that the Wnt pathway induces Lin28
up-regulation and let-7 down-regulation to enhance breast
cancer cell expansion.

of miRs in human neoplasms. In addition, both form
mutual feedback circuits, thereby increasing the
connectivity and complexity of the regulatory network.
Chartering this network will facilitate the development
and advancement of miR-based clinical applications.

MIR-BASED THERAPEUTICS
Recently, miR-based therapeutics have been
developed based on the regulatory network of miRs
and Wnt/β-catenin. MiR-based anticancer therapeutic
approaches have used several strategies such as miR
sponges, anti-miR oligonucleotides, miR masks, and
small molecule inhibitors (reviewed in [1]). MiR-34 is
lost or down-regulated in different types of cancer such
as glioblastoma, HCC, cervical, ovarian, colon, and lung
cancer. The ability of miR-34 to regulate a set of multiple
Wnt signaling components in WNT pathway (discussed
above) makes it an excellent candidate for novel Wnttargeted therapy. MRX34 is a liposomal mimic of miR-34.
A multicenter Phase I clinical trial of MRX34 is currently
recruiting patients (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01829971).
MRX34 is used for patients with advanced HCC, other
selected solid cancers and hematologic malignancies.
The scope of the trial is to establish the safety,
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MRX34. The
company planned to finish the phase 1 trial by the end of
2016 and start the phase 2 clinical trial in 2017.
Pioneering work has certain challenges that
must be overcome before miR-based therapies can be
used in a clinical setting. Low bioavailability, specific
tissue delivery, off target side effects, miR instability,
immunogenicity and tumorigenicity are major problems
to solve before the application in human clinical trials
[1]. Despite these challenges, targeting miRs in cancer
to rewire signaling networks is an applicable and rational
strategy with great potential for success.

Feedback loop between miRs and the Wnt
pathway
There are positive feedback circuits between
miR and Wnt signaling. MiR-218 and Wnt pathway
form a positive feedback loop to increase osteoblast
differentiation and abnormal expression of osteoblastic
genes in breast cancer cells [112]. MiR-218 activates the
Wnt pathway by targeting three Wnt signaling inhibitors
(Sclerostin (SOST), DKK2, and sFRP2) during the
process of osteogenesis. MiR-218 is also induced by
active Wnt signaling, creating a positive feedback loop.
MiR-146a expression is activated by SNAIL in a β-catenin
dependent manner in CRC stem cells. In turn, miR-146a
stabilizes β-catenin by targeting Numb [113]. A feedback
loop is formed to direct symmetric cell division through
activation of the Wnt pathway. MiR-372&373 induced
by Wnt dependent transcription in turn, activates Wnt/βcatenin signaling by targeting Wnt signaling inhibitors
including DKK1 [36].
Mutual inhibition between miR and Wnt pathway
has also been observed. In glioma cells, miR-122
inhibits the Wnt pathway, which negatively regulates
the expression of miR-122 [114]. In CRC, miR-101 and
the Wnt pathway form a mutual inhibitory relationship
[51]. The Wnt pathway activity represses the expression
of miR-101 while overexpression of miR-101 strongly
impairs β-catenin nuclear accumulation.
In addition, a negative feedback loop was also
found between miR and the Wnt signaling pathway. MiR483-3p targets β-catenin which induces the expression of
miR-483-3p [115]. They form a negative feedback circuit
in normal cells however, this negative feedback loop is
inactivated if β-catenin carries an activating mutation.
In summary, miRs regulate the Wnt signaling
pathway and Wnt signaling in turn modulates expression

CONCLUSIONS
Collectively, we have summarized the current
understanding of crosstalk between miRs and the
canonical Wnt signaling cascade in various types of
tumors. Communication intersects in multiple planes to
modulate cell proliferation, migration, cancer metastasis,
and drug response. MiR-based therapeutics have entered
clinical trials; a stage where opportunities and challenges
co-exist for miR-based therapeutics for cancer. A better
understanding of miRs and the Wnt signaling regulatory
network will provide insights to further the development
of miR-based remedies.
