Abstract
Numerous clinical and animal studies show that hormone replacement therapy reduces the risk of colon tumor formation.
However, the majority of experiments have shown that estradiol (E2) does not inhibit the growth of malignantly transformed colon epithelia. As such, the presented studies
focused on evaluating the effects of E2 in noncancerous colonocytes. E2 treatments (0–10 nmol/L) reduced cell growth and
increased apoptotic activity in young adult mouse colonocytes
(YAMC), a nonmalignant cell line, in a dose-responsive manner. These effects were lost in the YAMC-Ras cells, an isogenic
cell line with a single malignant transformation. Cotreatment
with an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist inhibited the physiologic effects of E2 in YAMC cells, suggesting that the response is ER mediated. To further study the effect of E2 on
colonic epithelia, we evaluated the development of preneoplastic lesions in ovariectomized wild-type (WT) and ERβ
knockout (ERβKO) mice treated with either vehicle or E2.
WT E2-treated animals exhibited significantly fewer aberrant
crypt foci and increased apoptotic activity in colonic epithelia
when compared with WT control mice or ERβKO animals receiving either treatment. For the first time, we showed that E2
alters the growth of nontransformed colonocytes in vitro and
that, through an ERβ-mediated mechanism, E2 influences the
physiology of noncancerous colonocytes, resulting in fewer
preneoplastic lesions. Collectively, these data show that the
protective actions of E 2 occur primarily during the initiation/promotion stages of disease development and identify
the hormone as an important chemoprotective agent. [Cancer

Introduction
Colon cancer incidence is higher in men (62.9 in 100,000) than in
women (45.8 in 100,000; ref. 1). This suggests a possible protection
in women due to hormonal differences. Data from the Women's
Health Initiative study showed a significant decrease in the incidence of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women receiving
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) compared with placebo (2).
In fact, the majority of clinical studies have shown that either HRT
or estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) can significantly reduce the
risk of colon cancer in postmenopausal women (3–7). Hoffmeister
and colleagues (8) found that HRT and ERT both significantly reduce colorectal cancer incidence, but there was no significant dif-

ference in effect between the two therapies. The level of protection
seen from ERT correlates with the degree of use, seen as a 29%
reduction in colon cancer risk, and if ERT had ever been used, this
increases to 45% for those currently undergoing ERT (3).
Animal study data support the theory of a significant protective effect against colon cancer in animals treated with estradiol
(E2). E2 treatment in ovariectomized rats reduced dimethylhydrazine-induced tumor numbers in the colon by 71% (9). Orally
administered estrone in ovariectomized wild-type (WT) and estrogen receptor (ER) α knockout mice inhibited formation of
azoxymethane (AOM)–induced tumors (10). Data from this study
are important because the fact that estrone suppressed tumor
formation in both WT and ERα knockout mice shows that
ERα is not the primary mediator for estrogenic protection in
the colon. However, several studies have shown that ERβ expression is inversely associated with colon tumor incidence
(11, 12). Most of these studies have correlated reduced ERβ expression with increased risk of colonic malignancy. However, no
studies have definitively shown the necessity of ERβ expression
in colonocytes to observe this protection.
In an effort to identify the mechanism by which E2 affects cell
growth, numerous different colon cancer cell lines have been
used as in vitro models; however, a majority of studies have
shown that E2 treatment does not influence cell growth in these
cell lines (13–17). Based on these data, we hypothesized that E2
would alter the physiology of nonmalignantly transformed colonocytes and that this response would result in reduced formation of
premalignant lesions in mice exposed to carcinogen. Furthermore,
we hypothesized that this effect would be modulated through ERβ.
To test our hypotheses, we characterized the effects of E2 in young
adult mouse colonocytes (YAMC) and in WT and ERβ knockout
mice (ERβKO). YAMCs are a well-characterized nonmalignant cell
line derived from the Immorto mouse (18). The data presented here
show that E 2 , through an ERβ-mediated response, affects cell
growth in nontransformed colonocytes, resulting in reduced incidence of premalignant lesions in the colon.

Materials and Methods
Cells. YAMC and YAMC-Ras cells were graciously provided by Dr. Robert
Chapkin (Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX). For general maintenance, cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 (Sigma) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone); 0.1% insulin, transferrin, and selenious acid (ITS; BD Biosciences); 1% penicillin/
streptomycin; and 1% Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained under permissive conditions, 33°C with 10 units IFNγ/mL (Roche) medium.
Cell growth assays. Forty-eight hours before plating, YAMC or YAMCRas cells were transferred to medium containing 5% charcoal-dextran–
stripped FBS, 1% Glutamax, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.1% ITS. Cells
were seeded at 30,000 per well on six-well plates. Twenty-four hours after
plating, cells were exposed to individual treatments of 0, 100, 1,000, or
10,000 pmol/L E2 or in combination with 1 μmol/L ICI 182,780 (ICI; fulvestrant, Sigma-Aldrich), and 48 h after the first treatment, the medium was

changed and a second dose of the given treatments was delivered. All treatments were diluted in DMSO as 1,000× stocks and delivered as 1 μL/mL
medium to achieve the final dose listed. At the end of the 96-h treatment
period, cells were trypsinized and prepared for counting. The experiments
at nonpermissive conditions were carried out as above but at 39°C and
without IFNγ. Cell concentration was determined using a Beckman Coulter
particle counter. Twenty microliters of sample were diluted in 10 mL Isotone II diluent (Beckman Coulter), and each sample was counted thrice. All
experiments were performed at the permissive temperature unless otherwise specified. Three wells per treatment per experiment were used and
either three or four replicate experiments were conducted.
SV40 protein levels. YAMC cells (250,000) were seeded in 25-mm flasks
and grown at 33°C in stripped serum medium. Cells were treated with
1 nmol/L E2 or vehicle for 96 h with medium and treatment was changed
after 48 h. Protein was extracted by adding 1.5 mL lysis buffer to the flask for
30 min at room temperature. After incubation, solution was mixed gently
with a pipette and the contents were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes.
Protein was quantified by UV spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined by Western blot using the Immobilon Western Chemilunescent
Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate kit (Millipore); the methodology
was previously described (19). Antibodies used were SV40 Large T antigen
antibody (Calbiochem) and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Assay Designs).
Reverse transcription-PCR. YAMC and YAMC-Ras cells were grown in
T-25 flasks under permissive conditions. Cells were trypsinized and centrifuged. The colon from a WT untreated mouse was removed and used for
RNA isolation using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification
System (Invitrogen). The Invitrogen protocol was followed for both cell
and tissue extractions. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) samples
contained 10 μL TaqMan One Step RT-PCR Master Mix, 1 μL primers
(Mm00599821 ERβ, Mm00433149_m1 ERα, or Hs99999901_s1 18s; Applied
Biosystems), 8 μL RNase-free water, and 1 μL RNA (20 ng/μL). RT-PCR was
run on a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermocycler for 40 cycles.
Cellular apoptosis. Cells were grown in stripped serum medium for
48 h before plating. Cells (30,000) were seeded on six-well plates and grown
in stripped serum medium under permissive conditions. Cells were treated
for 96 h, with 0, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 pmol/L E2 treatments changed every
48 h. At the end of the treatment period, cells were trypsinized and collected. After collection, cells were centrifuged and the medium was replaced with lysis buffer from the EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay kit no. 2
(Invitrogen). The Invitrogen protocol was followed for this procedure. Apoptosis was measured as increased fluorescence measured on a TECAN
infinite M200 plate reader. Three wells per treatment per experiment were
used and four replicate experiments were conducted.
Mice. Heterozygous ERβKO (+/−) c57BL6/J mice were obtained from
The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were bred and housed at the Laboratory Animal Resources and Research facility at Texas A&M University. ERβKO and
WT mice were produced from the original breeding pairs and genotyped
from genomic tail DNA. All procedures were performed under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas
A&M University.
Carcinogen treatment and aberrant crypt foci analysis. Female mice
between the ages of 2 and 8 mo were ovariectomized, and either 20 mg
cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) or 18 mg cholesterol/2 mg E2 pellet was implanted s.c. on the back at the base of the neck at the time of ovariectomy.
Pellets were prepared as described in ref. (20). Pellets were replaced 8 wk
later. Mice were transferred to a phytoestrogen-free diet at the time of surgery and allowed food and water ad libitum. Two weeks after surgery, mice
received the first of six weekly injections of AOM (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 mg/
kg body weight. Eight weeks post-AOM, animals were killed. Blood was collected through cardiac puncture. The colon was resected and 1-cm sections
from the distal end were cassetted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc.). The remainder of the colon was flattened between
sheets of filter paper and fixed in 70% ethanol. Ethanol-fixed colons were
stained with 0.5% methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich) and aberrant crypt foci
(ACF) were counted as previously described (21, 22).
Plasma E2. Plasma E2 concentrations were determined using an Estradiol EIA kit (Cayman). Fifty microliters of plasma/sample were added to

sample wells, and samples from E2-treated animals were diluted 1:10. Fifty
microliters of Tracer and antiserum were added per sample well and the
plate was incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed five times with wash
buffer. Ellman's Reagent (200 μL) was added per well and incubated in the
dark for 60 to 90 min while shaking. Wells were read on a plate reader at
415 nm.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed using the ApopTag Plus
Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Millipore) according to manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, distal colon sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, paraffin embedded,
sectioned, and mounted. Tissues were deparaffinized in three washes of
xylene and rehydrated. Slides were quenched with hydrogen peroxide for
8 min and counterstained in 0.5% methyl green solution for ∼9 min.
Statistical analysis. Statistics were performed using a Student's t test,
one-way ANOVA with Tukey's correction, or two-way ANOVA, depending
on the outcome analyzed. t test analyses were performed in Excel, and
ANOVA data were run in Minitab 15. A 99% confidence interval for the
mean count difference (estrogen minus control) and a one-sided test of
whether mean estrogen counts were less than control counts were calculated for ACF data. Also, for total ACFs and high-multiplicity ACFs, we
specifically tested for a nonzero interaction in the effect of estrogen by
mouse type (knockout or WT). All values listed are group mean and error
bars are presented as SEM.

YAMC and YAMC-Ras cell lines and was similar to that seen in
colonic tissues collected from a female WT mouse (Fig. 2A), and
no detectable ERα expression was observed at the mRNA level
(data not shown). When YAMC cells were treated with E2, relative
expression of ERβ was enhanced compared with vehicle controls
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Collectively, these studies show that ERβ
is expressed in YAMC cells and its expression changes in the
presence of E2. In addition, these data suggest that the loss of
E2 responsiveness in the YAMC-Ras cells is not the result of suppressed ERβ expression.
Cotreatment of ICI with E2 prevents cell growth inhibition.
Having shown ERβ to be present in both cell lines, we next wanted
to determine if the growth-inhibitory effect of E2 treatment was
mediated through the ER. YAMC cells were treated with 0 to
10,000 pmol/L E2 concentrations either in the presence or absence
of 1 μmol/L ICI, a well-described ER antagonist that inhibits both
receptor subtypes (Fig. 2B; refs. 23, 24). With each E2 dose, cotreatment with ICI fully inhibited the growth suppression induced by

Results
E2 inhibits nonmalignant cell growth. First, we measured the
effect of E2 treatment on cell growth in nonmalignant colonocytes.
YAMC cells treated with 0 to 10,000 pmol/L E2 exhibited reduced
cell growth when treated for 96 h under permissive conditions
(Fig. 1A). As the E2 dose increased, there was a corresponding
decrease in cell growth (P < 0.0001). These data show a growthinhibitory effect in nonmalignant colonocytes exposed to physiologic levels of E2.
We then treated these cells with the same doses of E2 under
nonpermissive conditions (39°C) to see if similar responses will
be observed when cells were in a more primordial state. Again,
E2 suppressed cell growth under these conditions in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B).
Because the conditional immortalization of these cells operates
through the expression of the temperature-sensitive SV40 large
T antigen, we wanted to rule out a possible interaction between
SV40 and E2 as the mechanism of effect. We chose to measure
the levels of this protein under permissive conditions with and
without a 1 nmol/L E 2 treatment. E2 treatment did not alter
SV40 protein levels when compared with control at the permissive
condition (Fig. 1A, inset).
Effect of E2 on YAMC-Ras cell growth. Next, we determined if
E2 treatment would result in a similar effect on cell growth in an
isogenic cell line with a single malignant transformation. YAMCRas cells contain an activated v-Ha-Ras oncogene. These cells,
when treated with E2, show no reduction in cell number (Fig. 1C).
This finding was in stark contrast to what was seen in nonmalignant cells and suggests that a single malignant transformation
could alter the ability of colonocytes to respond to the presence
of E2.
ERβ expression in YAMC, YAMC-Ras, and WT mouse colonic
tissues. To see if the change in E2 responsiveness was a result of
altered ERβ expression, RT-PCR was performed to evaluate differences in ERβ expression between YAMC and YAMC-Ras cells. Relative expression of ERβ was not significantly different between the

E2 Reduces Cell Growth in Noncancerous Colonocytes

We began by exploring the ability of E2 to suppress the formation
of ACFs, premalignant lesions that are predictive of tumor formation. ACFs were only observed in the distal two thirds of the colon,
with the majority found in the most distal region. WT animals treated with the vehicle control had the highest number of ACFs averaging 29 ACFs per animal, whereas WT animals treated with E2
showed a significant reduction (14.9 ACFs per animal; P < 0.0001;
Fig. 4A). More importantly, when analysis is narrowed to high-multiplicity ACFs (foci involving at least four crypts), the difference
between groups becomes more pronounced (Fig. 4B). WT animals
receiving E2 averaged 3.2 high-multiplicity ACFs per animal, whereas WT control mice averaged over 10.6 high-multiplicity ACFs per
animal (P < 0.0001). These data show a pronounced reduction in
preneoplastic lesions associated with E2 treatment.
ERβKO animals had similar numbers of ACFs in both control
(21.1 ACFs per animal) and E2-treated (20.2 ACFs per animal,
P = 0.2) mice (Fig. 4A). There was a slight but significant difference
(P = 0.01) in high-multiplicity ACFs in the ERβKO mice between
treatments, with E2-treated animals averaging 8.4 and control

cells were grown under permissive conditions and transferred to a charcoal

above experiment was repeated with YAMC-Ras cells. Data are expressed as

E2. In fact, cotreating with ICI resulted in cell numbers that were
not significantly different than the untreated control group. ICI antagonism of E2 growth inhibition strongly supports the theory that
this is an ER-mediated response.
Apoptosis in YAMC and YAMC-Ras cells treated with E2.
Next, we wanted to identify the physiologic response involved with
estrogenic growth inhibition. Caspase-3 activation was used to determine the relative numbers of apoptotic cells when YAMC and
YAMC-Ras cells were treated with 0 to 10,000 pmol/L E 2 for
96 hours. YAMC cells exhibited an increase in caspase-3 activity
in a dose-responsive manner (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). In contrast,
YAMC-Ras cells showed no significant increase in caspase-3 activity at any concentration of E2 (Fig. 3B). These data point to apoptosis being a mechanism involved in the E2 -induced growth
inhibition of nonmalignant colonocytes.
Formation of ACF. We next wanted to investigate the role of
E2 treatment in the colon at a premalignant stage of disease.

E2. This response was also observed in YAMC cells maintained
at nonpermissive conditions, suggesting that E2 has similar actions
in colon cells that are more primordial in nature. YAMC-Ras are
isogenic cells that were developed from YAMCs and contain an activated v-Ha-Ras oncogene. These cells are fully transformed and
will continue to grow under nonpermissive conditions and form
colonies in soft agar (29). The Ki-Ras oncogene is present in
∼50% of colonic adenomas and carcinomas and was found to be
common in tumors from all stages, including villous adenomas and
villoglandular polyps that are nonmalignant but often progress to
malignancy (30, 31). Data from YAMC-Ras cells show that overexpression of an activated v-Ha-Ras oncogene negates the growth
inhibition due to E2 exposure.
Having identified an effect of E2 on cell growth, we wanted to
determine if this response was ER mediated. ERβ is the predominant form of ER found in the colon and is expressed in some colon
cancer cell lines (13, 25). Cotreatment of E2 with ICI, an ER antagonist, resulted in a loss of the growth inhibition induced by E2.
Because ERβ expression levels were not significantly different

animals averaging 9.4 ACFs per animal (Fig. 4B). Together, these
data distinctly show a relationship between ERβ and E2 in the colon.
Plasma E2 concentrations. We measured plasma E2 levels in
vehicle control and E2-treated animals. Mice receiving cholesterol-only pellets showed plasma E2 levels averaging 22.4 pmol/L in
WT and 33.9 pmol/L in ERβKO animals (Fig. 5). Those receiving
E2-containing pellets showed average E2 levels of 2.9 nmol/L in
WT and 3.0 nmol/L in ERβKO animals (P < 0.0001).
Apoptosis within the colonic crypt. Having found a distinct
phenotype associated with E2 treatment in WT animals, we analyzed apoptosis to see if there was an association with E2 treatment. The induction of colonocyte apoptosis was determined in
tissues collected from each experimental group. Within the distal
colon, crypts analyzed from WT mice receiving E2 exhibited a significantly higher degree of apoptotic cells compared with those
from the control. ERβKO mice showed a slight but significant difference in apoptosis with E2 treatment with more apoptotic cells
per crypt than the ERβKO control mice (Fig. 6A). As can be seen in
both images, it is common for cells on the luminal surface outside
of the crypt structure to become apoptotic in association with
these cells being sloughed off. Therefore, only cells within the crypt
were analyzed. Interestingly, the increase in apoptosis in E2-treated
WT mice was associated with an increase in apoptotic cells observed in the lower regions of the crypt in WT animals treated with
E2 (Fig. 6B and C).

Discussion
Limited data have shown that E2 treatment reduces cell growth
in three colon cancer cell lines, DLD-1, HCT116, and LoVo (25–27).
However, the majority of cell culture studies have shown no reduction or an increase in growth in response to E2 in colon cancer
cells that are fully transformed (13–17, 28). Collectively, these data
highlight the need to study the effects of E2 in other cell models
and specifically in nonmalignantly transformed colonocytes. YAMC
cells are morphologically primitive epithelial cells, with no evidence of differentiation (18). For the first time, we show that E2
can alter the growth of nonmalignant colonocytes by showing a
significant reduction in cell number in YAMC cells treated with

E2 Reduces Cell Growth in Noncancerous Colonocytes

between YAMC and YAMC-Ras cell lines, the question of mechanism of activity arises. It is possible that a nonfunctional protein is
being produced in the YAMC-Ras cells or that malignant transformation affects the pathway at a point after receptor activation. Future studies will address these important questions.
We next measured apoptosis to begin identifying the cellular responses to E2 that result in growth inhibition. As with cell growth,
some studies have shown apoptosis to be increased with E2 treatment in colon cancer cell lines (28, 32), but others show no response. We observed a significant induction of caspase-3 activity
in YAMC cells and no significant response in YAMC-Ras cells when
the cell lines were treated with E2. We also conducted experiments
to determine if E 2 treatment altered the progression of cells
through the cell cycle, but no significant differences were seen
between treatments (data not shown). These data suggest that
E2 reduces cell growth in noncancerous colonocytes by induction
of apoptosis; however, this response is lost following malignant
transformation.
To investigate how E2 affects the development of preneoplastic
lesions, we first analyzed colonic tissue from WT animals receiving
chemical carcinogen to better define the effects of E2 at a premalignant stage of colon carcinogenesis. Ovariectomized WT mice exhibited a significant reduction, both in total number of ACFs and
high-multiplicity ACFs, when treated with E2 compared with those
treated with vehicle control. The profound reduction of highmultiplicity ACFs in E 2-treated mice is of significant interest
because these lesions are most predictive of eventual tumor formation (33). These data support other findings showing E2 to be protective against tumor formation (34–36). However, our studies
were focused on examining premalignant tissue and show a
chemoprotective role for E2 therapy before tumor formation.
We then compared the ACF data from WT animals with that
from ERβKO mice. Clinical studies have shown reduced ERβ expression in colonocytes within tumors when compared with adjacent uninvolved tissue (37–39). A functional ERβ was previously
determined to be involved with E2 protection in APC Min mice
(11). We have studied premalignant carcinogenesis and have
shown that E2 has a profound effect at this stage. In the presented
studies, the reduction in the number of ACFs in WT animals treated with E2 was pronounced and almost completely lost in ERβKO
mice. These data clearly define the necessity for functional ERβ
expression for E2 treatment to exhibit a protective effect against
cancer development in the colon.
Plasma E2 concentrations in E2-treated mice were marginally
higher than those seen in a nonpregnant cycling woman, but well
below those seen during pregnancy (40, 41). Mice receiving control
pellets were below the threshold associated with menopause in
women (42). Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo data show the
influence of E2 on cell growth in noncancerous colonocytes, but
additional studies are needed to determine the minimal dose required to observe those effects.

We then sought to determine if apoptosis is induced in the colonocytes of animals treated with E2. There was a significant induction of apoptosis in colonocytes in sections taken from WT
animals treated with E2 when compared with tissues from control
mice. These cells are likely to have chemically induced DNA damage, but are not yet to the point of malignant transformation. Collectively, the YAMC and tissue data show that E 2 treatment
induces apoptotic activity in nonmalignant colonocytes. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the YAMC cell line is a suitable
model for studying the role of E2 on nonmalignant colonocytes.
One interesting observation from analysis of tissues collected from
the mice was that apoptotic cells in the WT E2-treated animals
were found throughout the depth of the crypt, whereas the vast
majority of apoptotic cells in the WT control–treated group and
both treatment groups in the ERβKO mice were confined to the
luminal third of the crypt. Generally, the majority of apoptosis seen
within a colonic crypt occurs near the luminal surface, before cells
are sloughed off. This increased range of apoptotic activity suggests a specific response to carcinogen-induced damage in WT animals treated with E2. Preliminary data do not show this increased
apoptotic activity in the lower portion of the crypt in non–AOMexposed WT animals treated with E2 (data not shown). This phenomenon has been referred to as directed apoptosis and may be
similar to the short-term apoptotic induction seen in rats after
AOM exposure (43).
In conclusion, E2 treatment showed a distinct phenotype in
YAMC cells and colonocytes within WT mice. Treatment with E2
reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in nonmalignantly
transformed cells in culture; however, expression of activated Ras
in an isogenic cell line nullified this effect. In addition, E2 treatment in ovariectomized WT mice exhibited a significant protection against preneoplastic lesions. This protection was lost in the
absence of ERβ and definitively shows that ERβ is the primary mediator of this protective effect. For the first time, these data present
evidence that E2 treatment protects colonocytes from malignant
transformation by increased apoptotic activity and begin to define
the role of E2 in nontransformed colonocytes. These findings are
first steps toward identifying ERβ as an important target for potential chemopreventative agents in reducing the risk of tumor formation in the colon.
