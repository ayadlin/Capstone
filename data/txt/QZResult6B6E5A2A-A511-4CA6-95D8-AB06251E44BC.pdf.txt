ABSTRACT
Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) encompasses a group of related but distinct
malignancies whose lack of a stereotyped genetic signature makes challenging
the identification of genomic landscape and the development of effective targeted
therapies.
Accumulated evidences strongly suggest that the remarkable genetic
heterogeneity of CC may be the result of a complex interplay among different causative
factors, some shared by most human cancers while others typical of this malignancy.
Currently, considerable efforts are ongoing worldwide for the genetic
characterization of CC, also using advanced technologies such as next-generation
sequencing (NGS). Undoubtedly this technology could offer an unique opportunity
to broaden our understanding on CC molecular pathogenesis. Despite this great
potential, however, the high complexity in terms of factors potentially contributing
to genetic variability in CC calls for a more cautionary application of NGS to this
malignancy, in order to avoid possible biases and criticisms in the identification of
candidate actionable targets. This approach is further justified by the urgent need to
develop effective targeted therapies in this disease.
A multidisciplinary approach integrating genomic, functional and clinical studies
is therefore mandatory to translate the results obtained by NGS into effective targeted
therapies for this orphan disease.

line remains to be established [3, 4].
The addition of targeted therapies in CC
management was expected to broaden the therapy options
and thereby improve the survival rate of these patients.
However, targeted therapies have failed or shown only
marginal benefits in several clinical trials with different
drugs alone or combination with chemotherapy (Table
1 and 2) [5-18, reviewed in 19]. The development of
effective targeted therapies in CC is challenging not only
because most of the clinical trials have been designed
for a mixed cohort of biliary tract cancer patients (thus
frequently under-powering the impact of CC patients),

Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a complex disease
encompassing a group of related but distinct malignancies
that may emerge at different anatomic sites along the
intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree [1].
CC treatment represents a major challenge for
oncologists. To date radical surgery, suitable only in a
limited number of patients, has offered the only chance of
cure [2]. Systemic treatment is confined to chemotherapy,
whose front-line backbone is gemcitabine in combination
with a platinum compound, while the efficacy of secondwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but also because of the underlying genetic variability of
the disease, whose lack of a stereotyped genetic signature
makes difficult the identification of potential actionable
targets [20].
Currently, considerable efforts are ongoing
worldwide for the genetic characterization of CC, also
using advanced technologies such as next-generation
sequencing (NGS). NGS has opened the possibility
to identify the full repertoire of tumor-borne genetic
alterations [21, 22] and, to date, it has been successfully
applied to simple models of human cancers, namely
pediatric tumors. Here the limited number of carried
genetic events, due to the relative short-term latency of
tumor onset, the fewer associated risk factors and the
frequent development of these malignancies in non selfrenewing tissues, has positively impacted on molecular
characterization and, ultimately, on the diagnostic workup of the disease [23].
The genetic characterization of adult solid tumors is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more complex. The many mutational events accumulated
during the disease course can indeed hamper the
discrimination between driver and passenger mutations
and hence the identification of the mutational landscape
in these cancers.
An even more complex scenario probably occurs in
CC. Although some studies have focused on the genetic
characterization of CC, the overall molecular pathogenesis
of this malignancy still remains poorly defined. Recent
findings suggest that this process may involve a multitude
of mutational events, including mutations in KRAS, TP53,
BRAF, PTEN, SMAD4, IDH1, IDH2, BAP1, ARID1A
and PBRMI genes, as well as FGFR translocations
[24-37]. Some of these mutational events have been
also implicated in CC prognosis. In particular, BAP1
and PBMR1 mutations have been associated with bone
metastases and worse survival in extrahepatic CC (ECC),
while KRAS and TP53 mutations, as well as loss of PTEN
expression, with worse survival in intrahepatic CC (ICC)

[32, 38, 39]. The prevalence of these molecular alterations,
however, varies among the studies and definitive results
are still lacking. Nonetheless, it is clearly emerging that
ICC and ECC represent two distinct tumors arising from
different genetic backgrounds [31, 32].
Accumulating evidence strongly supports the notion
that the remarkable genetic heterogeneity of CC may be
the result of a complex interplay among different factors,
some shared by most human cancers, while others typical
of this malignancy.
Recent findings suggest that the large number
(probably the highest among all human malignancies)
of established or putative risk factors associated with
CC (Table 3) [40-47, reviewed in 48] may play a pivotal
role in driving genetic heterogeneity in this disease. In
this regard, a differential mutation pattern between ICC
developing on chronic advanced disease and ICC arising
on normal liver has been reported [34]. In particular, an
opposite mutation rate (higher for EGFR and lower for
KRAS, MLH1 and GNAS genes) has been observed in
ICC with chronic advanced disease compared to ICC
with normal liver, while PIK3CA, PTEN, CDKN2A and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TP53 mutations were found only in ICC developing on
normal liver. Furthermore, whole-exome sequencing
analysis between CCs linked to O. viverrini infection
and CCs not related to such exposure has identified two
distinct mutational patterns in the two subgroups, with a
major frequency of BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2 mutation in
non-O. viverrini-related CCs and a major mutation rate
in TP53, KRAS, SMAD4, MLL3, ROBO2, RNF43 and
PEG3 genes in O. viverrini-related CCs, respectively [26].
Mutations of RNF43 and PEG3 genes, in particular, have
been shown to activate the WNT/β-catenin signaling,
leading to chromosomal instability and cell proliferation
[49, 50]. Activation of this pathway has been reported
in CC (particularly in ICC), a phenomenon that may be
linked not only to mutations occurring in these two genes,
but also to the presence of inflammatory macrophages in
the stroma surrounding the tumor, which sustain WNT/βcatenin signaling through the production of WNT ligands
[51, 52]. The frequent pathological activation of this
pathway in CC reinforces the notion that WNT/β-catenin
signaling could play a pivotal role in CC carcinogenesis
and represent a potential therapeutic target in this disease,

as recently reported [52].
The induction of distinct genetic profiles in CC by
different risk factors could rely not only on the different
carcinogenetic mechanisms driven by such risk factors,
but also on the existence along the biliary tree of two
distinct stem cell niches, the canals of Hering harboring
hepatic stem cells (HpSCs) and the peribiliary glands
harboring biliary tree stem/progenitor cells (BTSCs) [5355, reviewed in 56]. Cell populations from HpSCs and
BTSCs lineages have been hypothesized to represent
distinct candidate cells of origin (the normal cells that
acquire the first cancer-initiating mutations) during CC
carcinogenesis, susceptible to distinct risk factors and
responsible for the development of the different ICC
and ECC subtypes [53-55, reviewed in 56]. In particular,
it is been suggested that the BTSC lineage may be
activated under pathological conditions affecting the
large intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (including
liver flukes, cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis,
hepatolithiasis, etc.), giving rise to large bile duct pure

mucin secreting ICC and ECC. Conversely, the hHpSC
lineage has been suggested to be activated in response to
parenchymal liver diseases (such as chronic viral/non viral
liver disease, schistosomiasis and liver cirrhosis) and to be
involved in the development of combined hepatocellular
carcinoma-ICC, bile ductular ICC and mixed ICC (this
last form being characterized by areas of focal hepatocytic
differentiation, ductular reaction and mucin-secreting
adenocarcinoma) [53-55, reviewed in 56, 57]. This stem
cell compartment is probably activated also during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and asbestos exposure,
as these two risk factors are exclusively associated with
the development of ICC [47, 58].
The genetic characterization of CC may be
further complicated by the presence of tumor clonal
heterogeneity (especially in the case of mixed ICC,
due to the presence of mixed differentiation features), a
hallmark of almost all human cancers [59-65]. Indeed,
founder cells harboring most of the tumor-borne genetic
mutations typically coexist with genetically distinct
14747

tumor sub-clones, intermixed or spatially separated across
the different topographic regions of the primary tumor
(intratumoral heterogeneity), and the same metastasis
(intrametastatic heterogeneity). Genetic variability can
also occur among metastases derived from the same
primary tumor (intermetastatic heterogeneity), since the
genetically different sub-clones of the primary tumor can
give rise to distinct lesions at the metastatic site [59-65].
This complex picture can be further exacerbated by the
highly dynamic nature of the tumor itself. Tumor clonal
architecture and genetic profile evolve dynamically
over time (probably following a branched, Darwinian
evolutionary process) under the selective pressure of the
tumor microenvironment and therapeutic context, and
as a consequence of genomic instability and stochastic

mutational events occurring during DNA replication [5967]. This last aspect could be particularly relevant in CC
since the diagnosis, frequently late, often occurs when
large macroscopic lesions have developed and tumor cells
have therefore undergone many cell divisions.
The dynamic changes in time and in space of tumor
subclonal composition may lead to an underestimated
or biased identification of the mutational landscape in
heterogeneous tumors if genetic characterization is carried
out only on a single tumor biopsy [68]. This approach
currently represents the standard of tumor diagnosis and
the backbone of personalized therapy decisions and may
significantly account for the high failure rate of some anticancer therapies. Sequencing of multiple tumor sites at
different time points during the disease course (diagnosis,

Figure 1: Overview of the main potential factors driving genetic heterogeneity in CC. Genetic variability in CC could

be the result of a complex interplay among several factors including: a. the existence of two genetically distinct stem cell niches along
the biliary tree (the canals of Hering with hepatic stem cells and the peribiliary glands with biliary tree stem/progenitor cells), with a
different susceptibly to risk factors; b. tumor clonal heterogeneity. Genetically distinct tumor cell sub-clones can coexist with founder cells
harboring most of the tumor-borne genetic mutations, either in the primary tumor (intratumoral heterogeneity), or in the same metastasis
(intrametastatic heterogeneity). Genetic variability can also occur among metastases derived from the same primary tumor, as the different
sub-clones of the primary tumor can give rise to genetically distinct lesions at the metastatic site (intermetastatic heterogeneity); c. stochastic
mutations and genomic instability. The large number of cell divisions required for cancer growth makes tumor cells prone to accumulate
genomic alterations with a high frequency, due to random mutations occurring during DNA replication and deficiencies in the mechanisms
involved in DNA repair; d) tumor microenvironment and cancer treatment. The tumor microenvironment and cancer therapy can induce
fluctuations in tumor sub-clonal architecture and genetic profile by promoting the selective growth of sub-clones with a survival advantage
within a given tumor microenvironment or a given therapeutic setting and by eradicating those with a less favorable survival advantage.

relapse and metastasis) has therefore been suggested
to resolve, at least in part, spatial and temporal tumor
clonal variability, and to better discriminate between
mutational events in the trunk (occurring at early stages
of tumor growth and detectable at all disease sites) or
branches (occurring later during the development of
tumor subclones and not detectable at all disease sites)
of the tumor phylogenetic tree [67-69]. Such procedure
would probably represent the best approach in CC, since
this malignancy is very often characterized by multifocal lesions at the primary site even at diagnosis, but
unfortunately it is not devoid of risks for the patient.
More recently, genotyping of circulating tumor DNA
fragments (the so-called “liquid biopsy”) is emerging as
a promising and less invasive type of analysis for tracking
tumor dynamics and monitoring genomic evolution in
real time [70]. Such DNA fragments are indeed released
in the bloodstream by tumor cells undergoing apoptosis/
necrosis and harbor the same genetic alterations of the
tumor itself, with the advantage that sampling of the blood
is minimally invasive for the patient and can be carried
out at any time during disease course. Further studies are
needed, however, to establish whether circulating tumor
DNA genotyping could represent an effective strategy for
the management of cancer patients, including CC ones, in
clinical practice.
Overall, the highly complex array of causative
factors (summarized in Figure 1) potentially contributing
to genetic variability in CC poses a challenge in capturing
the genomic landscape of this disease. Despite the great
potential of NGS, this technology should be therefore
applied to CC genetic characterization with caution in
order to avoid possible biases and criticisms in detecting
driver mutations in CC carcinogenesis. This approach
is further justified by the urgent need to better define
potentially actionable targets in this disease. Although it
is still an unresolved issue, the mutations in molecular
pathways (including KRAS, mTOR, tyrosine kinase
receptor signaling) driving the carcinogenesis of many
human cancers suggest that these alterations may also
drive CC carcinogenesis, opening the possibility to stratify
CC patients into distinct molecular subgroups for targeted
therapies [31].
Given the marked genetic variability of CC, it seems
likely that the best chance of response could be achieved
by a combination of drugs targeting different driver
mutations in this disease. Obviously, the ideal therapeutic
regimen would include drugs specifically tailored to the
unique genetic make-up of the individual patient, which
is the cornerstone of “true” personalized therapy in cancer
treatment [71]. This approach represents the final goal
of future precision medicine but, unfortunately, it is still
not feasible in clinical practice (even in tumors whose
genetic pathogenesis is well known), mainly because of
the current lack of knowledge about the toxicity of some
drug interactions and the difficulty of prescribing high cost
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drugs whose refund cannot be guaranteed by regulatory
entities. Therefore, the current selection of cancer patients
likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy is still
based on tumor histology and on the analysis of a limited
number of hotspot mutations.
More recently a new strategy, the so-called basket
trial, suggests the use of targeted therapies exclusively
on the basis of identified actionable targets, irrespective
of tumor histology and other clinical/biological variables
[72]. Despite the growing enthusiasm for this approach,
the results of the CUSTOM basket trial have pointed
out its potential limits [73]. Indeed, while a clinically
significant overall response rate of 60% was reported in
the subgroup of patients with the EGFR mutation who
received erlotinib, the other 40% of patients did not
respond, suggesting additional “hidden” oncogenic events
may be responsible for treatment failure. Furthermore,
selumetinib monotherapy did not achieve its primary
endpoint in patients with RAS or RAF mutations. These
findings strongly suggest that the disease-specific context
cannot be easily bypassed, as it very often determines
whether a candidate mutation represents a clinically
valid endpoint. This is well known, for example, for the
BRAFV600E mutation, which is associated with a clinical
response to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma but not in
colon cancer [74, 75]. An excellent clinical response
to doublet-targeted therapy with the BRAF and MEK
inhibitors dabrafenib and trametinib has also been
reported in an ICC patient harboring this mutation [76].
However, whether BRAFV600E represents a driver mutation
in ICC and whether other ICC patients with this mutation
could benefit from treatment with BRAF inhibitors await
clarification.
In summary, the identification of candidate
actionable mutations in CC is challenging because of
the many factors potentially contributing to genetic
heterogeneity in this malignancy. Undoubtedly, NGS
may offer an unique opportunity to broaden our
understanding of CC molecular pathogenesis; however, a
multidisciplinary approach integrating genomic, functional
and clinical studies is mandatory to translate the results
obtained into effective targeted therapies for this orphan
disease.
