Abstract
Metastatic spread of melanoma to the central nervous system
(CNS) is associated with dismal prognosis. Preclinical testing
of novel therapeutic approaches would be aided by the
development of appropriate models of spontaneous CNS
metastasis arising from primary tumors. A highly metastatic
variant of the WM239A human melanoma cell line, designated
113/6-4L, was generated and used to test the efficacy of longterm, low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide and vinblastine chemotherapy on advanced established metastatic
disease in sites such as liver, lungs, and lymph node. This
treatment resulted in control of advanced, systemic disease
and prolongation of survival. Among long-term surviving
mice, 20% showed the presence of spontaneous brain
metastases. Two cell lines (131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2) were
generated from such metastases, which were found to
spontaneously metastasize to brain parenchyma with occasional localization to leptomeninges, after orthotopic transplantation and removal of the primary tumor. The cell lines
were found to have increased ability to proliferate in brainconditioned medium and displayed enhanced adhesion to
lung and brain endothelial cells. These findings represent the
first report of spontaneous CNS metastases generated from
primary tumors of any human cancer in mice, which heritably
maintains this phenotype, and as such, the variant cell lines
generated should aid studies in the biology and treatment of
CNS metastases, especially of melanoma origin. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Metastatic spread of melanoma, especially to the central nervous
system (CNS), is associated with a dismal prognosis (1). Present
treatment strategies show only low response rates, bring about
small increases in median survival, and as a result of poor
penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and possibly other factors,
have little activity against melanoma CNS metastases as well as
brain metastases in other tumor types (2). Presently there is a lack
of effective chemotherapeutic options for treatment of brain
metastases. The problem of CNS metastases is generally growing
in magnitude, particularly for certain malignancies where new
therapies that are effective in controlling for a time systemic
metastatic disease are currently available (3). As such, the
importance of CNS as a sanctuary site for melanoma and other
types of cancer is an essential aspect to consider in the development

of more effective therapeutic treatments (4, 5). Clearly, this
increases the need for developing appropriate preclinical models
of spontaneous CNS metastases in which tumor spread from a
primary orthotopic site leads to the spontaneous formation of
metastatic lesions in the brain in a manner that reflects the clinical
presentation of the disease (6). Such a model would facilitate the
study of the biology and treatment of such lesions. We report here
the successful development of such a model, which could in
principle, be applied to other types of cancers.

Materials and Methods
Generation of highly metastatic melanoma cell line 113/6-4L. One
million human melanoma WM239A cells were injected subdermally into
four CB-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) female mice. Primary
tumors were allowed to develop and resected once they reached a size of
400 to 500 mm3. Mice were sacrificed (4–6 mo posttumor resection) and
lungs were examined for the presence of metastases. Lungs from one mouse
with evidence of tumor involvement were adapted for tissue culture and cell
line 113/6-4L derived. One million 113/6-4L cells were injected and primary
tumor was resected as above. Mice were sacrificed at 6 to 8 wk postprimary
tumor resection and lungs were examined for the presence of metastases.
Extensive metastatic involvement was observed.
Metronomic cyclophosphamide and vinblastine therapy. One million
113/6-4L cells were injected subdermally into CB17-SCID female mice,
and primary tumors were resected as above. To examine the efficacy of
cyclophosphamide and vinblastine on metastatic melanoma, mice were
separated into 4 groups (10 mice per group); group 1, normal saline (NS)
daily in drinking water and i.p. injections of NS 3 weekly; group 2, NS daily
in drinking water and vinblastine; group 3, NS (i.p. 3 weekly) and
cyclophosphamide; group 4, vinblastine and cyclophosphamide. Vinblastine
was given at a dose of 0.33 mg/Kg administered by i.p. injection (3 weekly)
and cyclophosphamide as 20 mg/Kg daily in drinking water, respectively.
Groups 3 to 4 were treated with an initial bolus dose of cyclophosphamide
(100 mg/Kg) at day 1 of treatment and repeated every 6 wk, as described by
Shaked and colleagues (7). Mice were sacrificed when moribund (usually as
a result of breathing difficulties).
Generation of brain metastatic cell lines 131-4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2
and characterization of their brain metastatic potential. The brains of
mice showing the presence of melanoma metastases were minced and plated
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Colonies of metastatic
melanoma cells were isolated and cultured. A similar approach was taken to
derive cell lines from lung metastases and which gave rise to the cell lines
131/7-4L and 131/8-2L. After derivation, cell lines were expanded by three
additional passages and aliquots were frozen. Cells used for injection were
expanded by three to four additional passages to generate sufficient number of
cells for injections. For these experiments, three mice were injected with
113/6-4L cells, four and five mice for 131/7-4L and 131/8-2L, respectively, and
seven and six mice for 131-4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2, respectively. Primary tumors
were removed when they reached a size of 500 to 700 mm3; mice were sacrificed
once moribund, as above. The presence of melanoma metastases in lung, liver,
kidney, and brain was examined by means of immunostaining with HMB-45
antibody (Novocastra; 1:30 dilution), a marker for melanoma. For each tissue,
up to 5 sections of 50 Am apart were examined.
Proliferation assay. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% organ-conditioned medium (brain, liver, lung, or kidney) as

chemotherapy in the model of advanced metastatic disease. A, parental unselected human WM239A melanoma cells were implanted subdermally, and the primary
tumors that developed were resected when they reached a size of f400 mm3. Four to six months after resection, lungs were excised from mice and adapted for
cell culture and the 113/6-4L-cell line was derived. Implantation of 113/6-4L cells resulted in high metastatic load in lungs in 6 wk postprimary tumor resection. B and C,

on evidence from clinical studies showing that a combinatorial metronomic treatment incorporating a cyclophosphamide analogue was active in patients with metastatic
melanoma (19) and preclinical evidence that low-dose therapy incorporating vinblastine results in effective response in malignant melanoma patients (20).

described previously (8). This organ-conditioned medium contains
soluble products released by the specific organ from which it was
generated. The extent of proliferation was determined with the aid of
MTS assay.
Adhesion assay. Melanoma cell adhesion to monolayers of murine
lung (MLE) or brain (MBrE) endothelial cells was performed as described
previously by Suzuki and colleagues (9). Endothelial cells were provided
by Dr. J. Fidler. Monolayers of endothelial cells were seeded on 96-well
plates and melanoma cell suspensions were added (5  105 and 1.5 
105 cell/mL for adhesion to MLE and MBrE, respectively). Adherent
melanoma cells were identified by immunostaining with HMB45 antibody
as above.

Results
Development of a new human tumor xenograft model for
advanced visceral (systemic) metastatic melanoma. To develop a more aggressive model of advanced metastatic melanoma,
we derived a highly metastatic human melanoma cell line (named
113/6-4L) using the human cell line WM239 as a starting point
(Fig. 1A). The method used is similar to that described previously
for generating a model of advanced metastatic breast disease (10).
The 113/6-4L variant was selected from diffuse spontaneous lung
metastases arising from the WM239 line, which were then
adapted to tissue culture. Whereas the parental line WM239
required 4 to 6 months (postprimary tumor resection) for the
formation of visible metastatic nodules in lungs, the 113/6-4L
variant only required 6 weeks for the formation of large
macroscopic nodules in the lungs and pleural cavity. Extensive
tumor burden (Fig. 1B and C) and morbidity at 8 weeks
postprimary tumor resection were common. No macroscopic
brain metastases were observed.
Examination of the effectiveness of combination metronomic chemotherapy on advanced metastatic melanoma.
Previous work from our laboratory has shown that a combination
doublet, ‘‘metronomic’’ chemotherapy regimen, in which each drug

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

is chronically administered in daily, small, nontoxic doses with no
prolonged breaks, was remarkably effective in the treatment of
advanced, established human metastatic breast cancer in SCID
mice (10). To examine whether an effective metronomic
chemotherapy approach could be designed for treating advanced
metastatic melanoma, we initiated concurrent combination
therapy of metronomic cyclophosphamide and vinblastine using
the 113/6-4L model described above, where treatment was
initiated at a stage of extensive metastatic burden. This treatment
regimen resulted in effective systemic disease control such that
median survival was almost doubled (99.5 and 180 days for
control and treated mice, respectively; Fig. 1D); treatment with
either vinblastine or cyclophosphamide alone resulted only in
reduced increases in survival (136 and 109 days, respectively).
These results show that, even in an end-stage model of metastasis,
the use of low-dose metronomic chemotherapy combination of
vinblastine/cyclophosphamide can control systemic metastatic
melanoma and highlight the importance of conducting further
investigations to examine whether a vinblastine/cyclophosphamide regimen incorporating standard agents can significantly
increase survival.
Development spontaneous melanoma CNS metastases.
Prolonged control of systemic metastatic disease has been
associated with the emergence of CNS metastases (11, 12). Thus,
we examined whether the effective control of visceral melanoma
metastasis mediated by vinblastine/cyclophosphamide could
result in the appearance of brain metastases. Among mice that
survived the long-term (170–190 days) chemotherapeutic treatment in the model noted above, 20% showed the presence of
spontaneous melanotic brain metastases (Figs. 1A and 2A). We
speculate that, as it has been shown to occur in human disease,
this occurred as a result of altering the natural course of
systemic disease in sites such as liver and lungs, thereby
allowing microscopic brain metastases sufficient time to grow
into larger visible lesions. From these metastases, two cell lines

A, both B1 and B2 showed a significantly
higher adhesive potential to monolayers of

B2, as well as 8-2L, were more efficient in
adhering to monolayers of lung endothelial
cells (ANOVA, P < 0.05). C, subdermal

(131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2) were generated. These cell lines, as
well as the ‘‘parental’’ metastatic 113/6-4L and cell lines derived
from lung metastases (131/7-4L and 131/8-2L), were injected
orthotopically (i.e., subdermally) in mice to examine their
metastatic properties. The pattern of metastatic colonization
was examined in tissues isolated from mice (days 97–180
postprimary tumor resection) that had not received any
therapeutic intervention. The parental and cell lines derived
from lung metastases were not able to spontaneously metastasize to the brain (Table 1). In contrast, the 131/4-5B1 and 131/
4-5B2 cell lines were capable of metastasizing to the brain in
approximately half (54%) of mice. Immunohistologic examination
shows that multiple metastases (ranging in size of 250–500 Am
in diameter) were present primarily in the brain parenchyma
(Fig. 2B and C), with occasional evidence of leptomeningeal
metastases (Fig. 2D). All cell lines metastasized with similar

efficiency to lung, liver, and kidneys, suggesting that brainmetastatic cell lines had not acquired an overall increase in
metastatic potential but rather had acquired changes that
specifically facilitated spread to and colonization of the brain.
Both 131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2 constitute the first reported
preclinical model of spontaneous human cancer xenograft brain
metastasis, including melanoma.
Characterization of cell lines established from spontaneous
brain metastases. Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for
progression of malignant tumor to brain metastases, including
melanoma, is limited (13). A preferential metastatic potential of a
tumor in a secondary (metastatic) site has been suggested to be
mediated by acquired alterations that facilitate processes such as
adhesion, or survival/proliferation in the target organ (8, 14). As
such, we examined whether the ability to metastasize to brain
might be influenced by alterations in adhesion of the tumor cells to

vascular beds in the brain. In this respect, brain-metastatic cell
lines 131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2 were found to be preferentially more
efficient in adhering to murine brain and lung endothelial cells
monolayers in vitro (Fig. 3A and B).
We next asked whether the brain metastatic phenotype might
be a reflection of changes leading to increased proliferation.
Examination of the growth of the various cell lines as primary
tumors showed no significant difference, suggesting that the
brain-metastatic cell lines have not acquired an intrinsically
increased proliferative potential, at least in the dermal microenvironment (Fig. 3C). We then examined whether the brainmetastatic cell lines had acquired alterations that allowed for
preferential growth in the brain microenvironment. To this end, the
tumor cell lines were cultured with organ-conditioned medium. No
preferential growth was observed when cell lines were cultured
with liver- or kidney-conditioned medium, and only 8-2L showed
a significant increase in proliferation in lung-conditioned medium
(data not shown). In the case of brain-conditioned medium, only
the brain-metastatic cells lines showed a significant increase in
proliferation when compared with the parental cell line (Fig. 3D).
Although not statistically significant, 131/7-4L and 131/8-2L
cell lines seem to show a tendency of increased proliferation
relative to the parental cell line 113/6-4L, which may reflect an
intermediary state of increased metastatic potential that may
require additional alterations to facilitate formation of metastatic
disease in the CNS.

Discussion
Despite the clinical significance of CNS metastases, there is a
limited understanding of the various alterations responsible for the
progression of malignant tumors to a brain-metastatic phenotype,
including malignant melanoma. Thus far, most of the insights
about the nature of the alterations required for a brain-metastatic
phenotype have been gained through the use of ‘‘experimental’’
metastasis models. However, these models do not reflect the
complete cascade of events involved in clinical metastatic disease
(15). As such, the experimental brain-metastatic cell lines
generated through these models are less likely to reflect the
mechanisms and genetic/epigenetic alterations that are essential
for successful metastasis to CNS. A better understanding of these
alterations can be gained through the use of models that
recapitulate all the steps involved in metastatic cascade (i.e.,
spontaneous dissemination from established orthotopic primary

tumors that results in the successful formation of a high rate of
metastatic lesions in the brain parenchyma).
Although the spontaneous spread of melanoma to brain in
rodent models has been previously documented (16), such reports
are rare and only a single previous report has been described in the
literature showing spontaneous and heritable metastasis to CNS.
However, this model used a single clone of a murine melanoma cell
line (B16), which metastasized only to leptomeninges (17) and,
thus, does not recapitulate clinical disease that presents largely
with metastases in the brain parenchyma (18).
The derivation of the human melanoma variants that can
spontaneously and heritably metastasize in mice to the CNS
from a primary tumor is unique. The procedure used to isolate
these cells replicates the selection mechanisms that lead to brain
metastases in malignant melanoma patients. As such, the spread
of 4-5B1/B2 cell lines to CNS is likely to recapitulate the
alterations that mediate this phenotype in clinical disease. This
is reflected by the ability of 4-5B1/B2 to spontaneously form
brain metastases in a manner that is characteristically seen in
melanoma brain metastasis patients (primarily parenchymal but
also with leptomeningeal localization). Our results implicate that
the acquisition of a brain-metastatic phenotype is likely favored
by alterations leading to increased adhesion of tumor cells to
brain endothelial cells and increased proliferation in the
presence of brain-derived factors. Identification of the specific
molecules/interactions that may facilitate these alterations is the
subject of ongoing studies. In this respect, our model is
particularly advantageous in that it allows the examination of
the sequence of alterations that occurs in the transition from
poorly metastatic (WM239A cell line) to highly visceral metastatic variant (113/6-4L) and then to brain-metastatic phenotypes
(4-5B1 and 4-5B2).
In this regard, we also note that the approaches described herein
for development of a model of spontaneous CNS metastases have
been recapitulated using the context of human breast cancer
xenografts.1
