Abstract
Tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role in protecting cells from malignant transformation by inducing
cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mutant p53 that is detected in more than 50% of cases of cancers loses its role in
suppression of tumors but gains in oncogenic function. Strategies to convert mutant p53 into wild-type p53 have
been suggested for cancer prevention and treatment, but they face a variety of challenges. Here, we report an
alternative approach that involves suppression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), an enzyme that glycosylates
ceramide and blunts its proapoptotic activity in cancer cells. Human ovarian cancer cells expressing mutant p53
displayed resistance to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. We found that GCS silencing sensitized these mutant
p53 cells to doxorubicin but did not affect the sensitivity of cells with wild-type p53. GCS silencing increased the
levels of phosphorylated p53 and p53-responsive genes, including p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax, and Puma, consistent with a
redirection of the mutant p53 cells to apoptosis. Reactivated p53-dependent apoptosis was similarly verified in
p53-mutant tumors where GCS was silenced. Inhibition of ceramide synthase with fumonisin B1 prevented p53
reactivation induced by GCS silencing, whereas addition of exogenous C6-ceramide reactivated p53 function in
p53-mutant cells. Our findings indicate that restoring active ceramide to cells can resuscitate wild-type p53
function in p53-mutant cells, offering preclinical support for a novel type of mechanism-based therapy in the
many human cancers harboring p53 mutations. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2276–85. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
p53 protein is a crucial tumor suppressor in preventing
tumorigenesis and tumor progression (1, 2). As an essential
transcription factor, p53 activates the expressions of
p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax, Puma, FAS, and others and consequently
regulates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis to remove abnormal
cells (1, 2). The transcription activity of p53 on p53-responsive
genes is sequence specific and mainly relies on its DNAbinding domain (DBD, residues 102–292) encoded by exon
5 to exon 8 (1, 2). In normal cells, the p53 is tightly controlled
and kept at low level, but DNA damage, oncogenic stress,
hypoxia, and cellular distress activate p53 by increasing its

kinases (3, 4).
p53 mutants that have been found in approximately 50%
cases of solid cancers turn this tumor suppressor into an
oncogenic factor (5, 6). These mutants are mainly located in
exon 5 to exon 8 (residue 126–306) of the core domain (6).
Mutant p53 thus loses sequence-specific binding to its responsive genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Mutant p53 is unable to activate MDM2 and degrades
protein through ubiquitination, resulting in mutant protein
accumulated in cell nucleus (7). Mutation of other tumor
suppressors often produces truncated proteins or is unable to
synthesize any protein; however, more than 80% of p53
mutants are missense and synthesized as stable and fulllength proteins (8). These p53 mutants confer a dominantnegative or oncogenic gain-of-function in cells (9). p53
mutants that promote tumor progression and resistance to
therapy become the most common prognostic indicator for
both cancer recurrence and death (10). Restoration of p53
function has been succeeded in regression of lymphomas,
sarcomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma and represents a
more effective means to cancer treatment (11–13). It has been
reported that gene therapy and small molecules (e.g., Prima-1,
Ellipticin, peptides) restore p53 function by addition of wildtype or alteration of protein conformation (13–15); however,
little is known whether p53 expression can be restored in p53mutant tumors. Gene therapy could not bring an adequate
benefit to ovarian cancers with standard chemotherapy (16),

Ceramide Restores p53-Dependent Apoptosis

which calls for exploration of new approach, restoring the
expression of wild-type p53.
Drug resistance is an outcome of multigene interactions,
and p53 mutants impede induced apoptosis when cancer cells
are under chemotherapy. Ceramide is an active sphingolipid
and plays critical roles in processing of apoptosis and other
cellular functions (17–20). Both ceramide and p53 are implicated in DNA damage–induced apoptosis (17, 18). Loss of
ceramide production confers resistance to radiation-induced
apoptosis in B-lymphoma and myeloid leukemia cells that
express wild-type p53 (21, 22). Glucosylceramide synthase
(GCS) catalyzes ceramide glycosylation, converting ceramide
to glucosylceramide. It is a limiting enzyme controlling intracellular ceramide and glycosphingolipids (23). Overexpression
of GCS that confers cell resistance to apoptosis (24, 25)
becomes a potential marker that predicts tumor response
to chemotherapy and clinical progression (26, 27). Inhibition
of GCS by gene silencing or tamoxifen leads p53-mutant
cancer cells to apoptosis (25, 28, 29). In this study, we
investigate whether disruption of ceramide glycosylation
restores p53-dependent apoptosis in p53-mutant cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
Drug-resistant human NCI/ADR-RES ovary cancer cells (30)
and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells were kindly provided
by Dr. Kenneth Cowan (UNMC Eppley Cancer Center, Omaha,
NE) and Dr. Merrill Goldsmith (National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, MD; ref. 31).The OVCAR-8 and A2780 human ovarian
cancer cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. M. Hollingshead
(Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis Tumor Repository at National Cancer Institute). Drug-resistant human ovarian cancer A2780ADR (also named A2780-DX3) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (32). MCF-12A, a normal human mammary epithelial cell line, was purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). MCF-7, NCI/ADR-RES, and
OVCAR-8 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin,
and 584 mg/L L-glutamine. A2780ADR cells were cultured in a
medium containing 100 nmol/L doxorubicin (Dox) in addition
to the aforementioned components. MCF-12A cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 5% horse serum,
insulin (5mg/ml), hydrocortisone (500 ng/ml), human epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml).
Cells were maintained in an incubator humidified with 95% air
and 5% CO2 at 37 C. Cell lines were authenticated in November 2010 at the John Hopkins University Fragment Analysis
Facility (Baltimore, MD), using Applied Biosystem Identifiler
System, to test for 16 STR markers and amelogenin for gender
determination. Authenticity was confirmed against the ATCC
database (http://bioinformatics.istge.it/clima/) and NCI-60
database published (33).
For MBO-asGCS (mixed-backbone oligonucleotide against
GCS) pretreatments, experiments were conducted as
described previously (29, 34). Briefly, after overnight culture,
cells (2  106/100-mm dish) were transfected with MBOasGCS (50–200 nmol/L; Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.),

www.aacrjournals.org

using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and cultured in 10%
FBS medium. MBO-asGCS were introduced into cells twice in
7 days to observe p53 expression. Cells were exposed to Dox (1
or 2.5 mmol/L, 48 hours) to induce p53.
GCS inhibitor, D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol HCl (D-PDMP), C6-ceramide (N-hexanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine), and C6-dihydroceramide (Nhexanoyl-D-erythro-sphinganine) were purchased from
Matreya. Dox hydrochloride and acidic sphingomyelinase
(100 units/mg) of human placenta was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1
(FB1), was purchased from Biomol. Puma siRNA and its
scrambled control were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by quantization of cellular
ATP, using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay
kit (Promega; ref. 29, 34, 35). Briefly, cells (4,000 cells/well)
were grown in 96-well plates with 10% FBS RPMI 1640
medium overnight. After pretreatments, cells were incubated
with Dox in 5% FBS medium for an additional 72 hours. Cell
viability was determined by the measurement of luminescent
ATP in a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek) following
incubation with CellTiter-Glo reagent.
Western blot analysis
After treatments, cells or tissue homogenates were lysed in
NP40 cell lysis buffer (Biosource). Equal amount of proteins
(50 mg/lane) were resolved using 4% to 20% gradient PAGE
(Invitrogen). After transferring, blots were blocked in 5% fatfree milk in PBST (0.05% Tween-20, 20 mmol/L PBS, pH 7.4)
and incubated with antibodies against p53 (Invitrogen), phosphorylated p53 (pp53) at Ser15, cleaved PARP (c-PARP), Puma
(Cell Signaling Technology), p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), active caspase-7 (a-Casp7; EMD Chemicals),
and GCS (1:500–1:5,000 dilution), respectively, at 4 C, overnight. After washing, these blots were incubated with horseradish peroxide–conjugated secondary antibodies and
developed using SuperSignal West Pico ECL (Thermo Scientific), as described previously (34, 35). Endogenous glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a
loading control. The levels of pp53 protein were represented
by the ratios of optical densities in pp53 bands normalized
against unphosphorylated p53.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells (10,000 cells/chamber) were grown in 4-chamber
slides via treatments for 48 hours. After fixation with methanol, cells were blocked with 5% goat serum PBS (block
solution) and incubated with antibodies against GCS
(1:1,000) or ceramide (1:500; clone MID 15B4 from Sigma)
and pp53 (1:1,000) in block solution at 4 C, overnight. Cellular
GCS and pp53 tagged with antibodies were recognized by
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 555 goat
anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000). Cellular ceramide and pp53 tagged
with antibodies were recognized by Alexa Fluor 555 goat antimouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000),

treatment groups (10 mice/group). For treatment, MBOasGCS (1 mg/kg/3 d) or MBO-SC (scrambled control for
MBO-asGCS) was administered intratumorally alone or with
Dox (2 mg/kg/wk, i.p.) for 32 days. The control group received
saline and Dox combination. Tumor volume was calculated by

width).

respectively. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
(40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in mounting solution. Slides
were observed under Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope
coupled with digital camera and images were captured using
Olympus DP controller software. Confocal images were captured using LSM Pascal confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging Inc.).
Tumors were fixed and maintained in paraffin blocks.
Microsections of each tumor (5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and identified by a pathologist. For
immunostaining, antigens were retrieved in steaming sodium
citrate buffer (10 mmol/L, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 6.0). After
blocking, slides were incubated with anti-GCS rabbit serum
(1:100) and anti-pp53 mouse primary antibodies at 4 C overnight. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.

TUNEL staining
Apoptotic cells of tumor tissues were detected by measurement of nuclear DNA fragmentation using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) system (Promega), following the manufacturer's
instruction, as described previously (29). Briefly, after antigen
retrieval, slides were put in 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K in 10
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 20 minutes for digestion and
labeled for 90 minutes with fluorescein-12-dUTP terminal
deoxynucleotide transferase reaction mixture at 37 C in a
humidified chamber. After mounting with DAPI, the sections
were observed.

Flow cytometric assay
The analyses were done as described previously (29). Cells (5
 105 cells/100-mm dish) were exposed to Dox (2.5 mmol/L) for
48 hours and harvested with trypsinization and centrifugation.
Cells resuspended were incubated with 0.01% propidium
iodide (PI) in staining solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.3%
Triton X-100, 2 mg/mL ribonuclease A) at 4 C for 30 minutes.
The cells were analyzed using FACSCalibur with CellQuest Pro
program (BD Biosciences). For each sample, 10,000 events were
counted 3 times and subphase G0/G1 was defined as indicative
of apoptotic cells in cell-cycle histograms.

Statistical analysis
Cell experiments in triplicate were repeated twice. All data
represent the mean  SD. Student's t test was employed to
compare mean values, using a Prism 4 program (GraphPad
software).

Results
Tumor xenografts and treatments
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Louisiana at
Monroe, and were handled in strict accordance with good
animal practice as defined by NIH guidelines. Tumor model
was established, as described previously (29, 34). Athymic
nude mice (Foxn1nu/Foxn1þ, 4–5 weeks old, female) were
purchased from Harlan. Cell suspension of NCI/ADR-RES
(3–5 passages, 1  106 cells in 20 mL/mouse) was subcutaneously injected in the left flank of the mice. Mice were
monitored by measuring tumor growth and body weight,
under clinical observation. Once tumors were visible (2
mm in diameter), mice were randomly allotted to different

Silencing of GCS by MBO-asGCS sensitized mutant p53
cells to Dox
Mutant p53, particularly the deletion mutant, is highly
associated with poor response to chemotherapy (10, 11).
NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cells are mutant p53 cell lines
that dominantly express the p53 with deleted 21-bp and 18-bp
within the DBD (36, 37). NCI/ADR-RES has an additional point
mutation, arginine instead of proline, at codon 72 of p53 (36).
A2780ADR cells do not respond to cisplatin-induced p53
activation, even though the mutation has not been determined
(32; Table 1). NCI/ADR-RES, OVCAR-8, and A2780ADR display
considerable resistance to several anticancer drugs including

Dox and cisplatin (31, 37; Table 1). To examine whether
disruption of ceramide glycosylation restores p53-dependent
apoptosis, we treated NCI/ADR-RES cells with MBO-asGCS to
silence GCS and then tested cell response to Dox. As shown in
Figure 1A, MBO-asGCS treatments significantly increased cell
response to Dox, as suppressed GCS expression in a dosedependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. S1A). At 200 nmol/L,
MBO-asGCS decreased the EC50 for Dox by 17-fold (12.9 mmol/
L vs. 0.8 mmol/L) as compared with vehicle control. To test
whether this sensitization is associated with p53 status, we
silenced GCS with MBO-asGCS (50 nmol/L, 7 days) in cell lines

with variant p53 status (Table 1). OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES
cells sharing mutant p53 displayed Dox resistance, and their
EC50 values for Dox were 22-fold (5.2 mmol/L vs. 0.23 mmol/L)
and 53-fold (12.4 mmol/L vs. 0.23 mmol/L) greater than p53
wild-type cells, either MCF-12A or MCF-7 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, silencing of GCS with MBO-asGCS sensitized p53mutant cells but not p53 wild-type cells. With decreases of
GCS protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S1B), MBO-asGCS
treatments decreased EC50 values for Dox in OVCAR-8,
NCI/ADR-RES, and A2780ADR by 4-fold, 8-fold, and 4-fold,
respectively. However, MBO-asGCS minimally reduced GCS
protein (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and the EC50 values in MCF12A, MCF-7, and A2780 cells (Fig. 1B).
Disruption of ceramide glycosylation increased pp53
and induced the expressions of p53-responsive genes in
mutant p53 cells
To examine whether disruption of ceramide glycosylation
alters p53, we used NCI/ADR-RES cells that dominantly
express mutant p53 and high level of GCS (25, 36). It was
found that suppression of GCS by MBO-asGCS increased the
expression levels of wild-type p53 and p53-resposive genes.
After 48 hours of treatment, MBO-asGCS increased the levels
of pp53 (at Ser15 in DBD) by more than 4-fold with p21Waf1/Cip1
and Bax, as GCS was significantly suppressed in NCI/ADR-RES
cells (Fig. 2A). Silencing of GCS by MBO-asGCS reactivated p53
response to Dox-induced DNA damage, as pp53 levels were
increased with a decrease in GCS protein (Fig. 2B). As
expected, GCS protein levels were suppressed by MBO-asGCS
in a dose-dependent manner; the pp53 levels were significantly
increased by greater than 2-fold, even though at 50 nmol/L
MBO-asGCS, whereas unphosphorylated p53 protein levels
were constant in all treatments (Fig. 2B). Consequently, the
levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 and Bax were enhanced with pp53
augmenting. The association of pp53 with GCS suppression
was confirmed in NCI/ADR-RES cells treated with D-PDMP, a
GCS inhibitor. Disruption of ceramide glycosylation by
D-PDMP
significantly increased the levels of pp53,
p21Waf1/Cip1, and Bax in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining revealed that suppression of GCS restored p53 response to Dox-induced DNA
damage. MBO-asGCS treatment dramatically decreased GCS
protein in Golgi apparatus where ceramide glycosylation
occurred, which, consequently, increased nuclear pp53 in more
than 90% of NCI/ADR-RES cells exposed to Dox (Fig. 2C).
Different from wild-type p53 A2780 cells (Fig. 2C, left panel),
pp53 particles were also detected in cytoplasm, even though
most pp53 were concentrated in nucleus of NCI/ADR-RES.
Disruption of ceramide glycosylation induced p53dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis in mutant
p53 cells
To examine the effects of GCS silencing on p53-responsive
genes, we further assessed cell division and apoptosis. Puma is
a major p53-responsive gene involved in induced apoptosis in
response to DNA damage, and cleaved PARP (c-PARP) and
active caspase-7 (a-Casp7) are effectors in p53-dependent
apoptosis processing (38, 39). We found that the protein levels

microphotographs (200) were captured by confocal microscopy. Cells were recognized by anti-GCS (green) and anti-pp53 (red) antibodies with Alexa

of Puma were significantly increased in NCI/ADR-RES cells
exposed to Dox after MBO-asGCS (Fig. 3A). The levels of cPARP and a-Casp7 were increased by 2-fold to 3-fold, respectively. Silencing of Puma with siRNA eliminated the effects of
reactivated p53 on Puma, c-PARP, and a-Casp7 (Fig. 3A). Flow
cytometric assays revealed that MBO-asGCS pretreatments
significantly affected cell division and apoptotic cells. The
numbers of G2/M phase cells that were under division and
proliferation in histogram of flow cytometry significantly
decreased with increasing concentrations of MBO-asGCS
(50–200 nmol/L); however, G1 phase cell numbers were
increased by 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 3B

(9.4% vs. 3.4% of total cells), 7-fold (24.8% vs. 3.4% of total
cells), and 15-fold (52.6 vs. 3.4% of total cells) at 50 to 200

totic effects of restored p53 (Fig. 3B and D). These data
indicate that silencing of GCS resulted in cell growth arrest
and apoptosis through p53-responsive genes.
Restoration of functional p53 expression induced
apoptosis in mutant p53 tumors
We further investigated whether silencing of GCS restores
p53 expression and eliminates mutant p53 tumor growth in
vivo. After tumors of NCI/ADR-RES were apparent, mice were
treated with MBO-asGCS (1 mg/kg twice a week, intratumoral
injection) combined with Dox (2 mg/kg once a week, i.p.) for
32 days. MBO-asGCS combined with Dox decreased tumor

Figure 3. GCS suppression promoted mutant p53 cells to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. NCI/ADR-RES cells were exposed to Dox (2.5 mmol/L, for
48 hours) following MBO-asGCS pretreatments (50 nmol/L, 7 days). Puma siRNA (siPuma, 100 nmol/L) and its scrambled control (SC, 100 nmol/L) were
introduced to cells in last 54 hours. A, Puma, a-Casp7, and c-PARP. Equal amount of proteins (50 mg/lane) was resolved and immunoblotted. B, flow

the ratio of pp53/p53 > 4-fold (P < 0.001), as compared with
vehicle control or MBO-SC. Consequently, the reactivated p53
substantially induced the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax,
Puma, and a-Casp7 (Fig. 4B). Immunostaining confirmed
these findings and showed that MBO-asGCS, but not MBOSC, significantly increased nuclear pp53 in tumors whereas
decreased GCS protein in cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). TUNEL analysis
indicated that approximately 80% of tumor cells underwent
apoptosis in tumors treated with MBO-asGCS, combined with
Dox, compared with only 3% and 9% of apoptotic cells in Dox
alone and Dox combined with MBO-SC (Fig. 4D). Thus, these
data indicate that GCS suppression restores wild-type
p53 expression and leads mutant p53 tumors to induced
apoptosis.
Ceramide mediated the restoration of p53 expression
To determine whether ceramide or glucosylceramide after
disruption of ceramide glycosylation is the factor restoring
p53, we assessed its effects on cellular ceramide and glycosphingolipids. In NCI/ADR-RES cells, MBO-asGCS treatments
(50–200 nmol/L) decreased globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and
significantly increased ceramide (Supplementary Fig. S2A) in a
dose-dependent fashion. At 200 nmol/L MBO-asGCS, endogenous ceramide increased more than 160% (1.01 vs. 1.65 ng/

100 mg protein, P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition,
MBO-asGCS significantly enhanced ceramide in other p53mutant OVCAR-8 and A2780ADR cells but not p53 wild-type
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Furthermore, we examined the
expression of pp53 and p53-responsive genes in NCI/ADR-RES
cells treated with ceramide synthase inhibitor and cell-permeable ceramide, respectively. As shown in Figure 5A, FB1
treatment (25 mmol/L, 28 hours) that inhibited ceramide
synthesis in de novo pathway eliminated the effects of
MBO-asGCS on restoration of p53. MBO-asGCS alone
increased pp53 protein level by approximately 9-fold, but
MBO-asGCS combined with FB1 could not enhance pp53
level or p21Waf1/Cip1 and Bax. Exogenous cell-permeable C6ceramide (C6-Cer, 25 mmol/L, 48 hours) substantially
increased pp53 level by 9-fold; however, C6-dihydroceramide
(C6-diH-Cer; 25 mmol/L, 48 hours) that had less bioactivity
enhanced pp53 by 2-fold and could not significantly increase
p21Waf1/Cip1 or Bax (Fig. 5A). Immunofluorescent staining
confirmed that MBO-asGCS dramatically increased cellular
ceramide and pp53 dramatically appeared in nucleus in cells
exposed to Dox (Fig. 5B). FB1 that inhibited ceramide synthase
prevented cellular ceramide and pp53 reactivated in nucleus,
even though MBO-asGCS disrupted ceramide glycosylation.
C6-Cer treatment significantly increased pp53 in nucleus, as

C6-Cer was detected mostly in cytoplasm and nuclear envelope (Fig. 5B).
To understand how silencing of GCS reactivates p53, we
examined protein, mRNA and heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA) of
mutant p53 and wild-type p53 in cell lines that dominantly
express wild-type 53 or mutant p53 after GCS silencing. As
shown in Supplementary Figure S3A, MBO-asGCS pretreatment (50 nmol/L, 7 days) did not significantly affect pp53
levels in MCF-12A and A2780 cells, as p53 expression in these
wild-type p53 responded to Dox exposure. In contrast, MBOasGCS considerably increased pp53 by approximately 3-fold in
mutant p53 OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells. The mRNA that
included p53 exon 5 could not be detected in mutant p53
OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells, even under Dox exposure
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). However, we detected p53 exon 5 in
mutant p53 cells after silencing of GCS with MBO-asGCS
pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Analysis of p53

hnRNA found that p53 exon 5 was transcribed in both
wild-type and mutant p53 cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S3C). These data indicate that silencing GCS may restore
p53 at the level of posttranscriptional processing.

Discussion
Reactivation of mutant p53 can trigger massive cell death
and efficiently eliminate abnormal cells. Previous works from
those of others have shown that both introduction of wildtype p53 by gene transfection and modulation of the protein
conformation by small molecules activate p53-responsive
genes and restore p53-dependent apoptosis in mutant p53
cancer cells (11, 14, 15). This study, for the first time, has
shown that suppression of GCS restores p53 expression and
its functions in mutant p53 ovarian cancer cells. Suppression
of GCS expression by MBO-asGCS disrupts ceramide

glycosylation and increases ceramide, which, in turn, leads cell
death and eliminates tumor progression through p53-dependent apoptosis.
Mutant p53 has been reported as a marker of poor
prognosis and a cause of chemotherapy failure in many
types of cancers (3, 6). More than 85% of point mutants
occur in the DBD encoded by exon 3 to exon 8 (5, 9). Exon 5
mutations are prognostic indicators of shortened survival in
non–small cell lung cancer (40). Small-fragment deletion is
less common than point mutant detected in p53 mRNA and
protein; however, all deletion mutants in DBD completely
lose p53 functions (5). In OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cells,
the 18-bp and 21-bp deletions in exon 5 confer these cells
resistance to anticancer drugs, particularly those inducing
DNA damage, including Dox and cisplatin (25, 36). It has
been shown that ceramide activates apoptosis processing in
response to DNA damage stress, when cells are exposed to

anticancer drugs, cytokines, and irradiation (19, 41). Ceramide can independently induce apoptosis in testicular germcell tumor cells with null or mutant p53 (42), although
ceramide response to DNA damage stress is p53 dependent
in others (18). Enhancing endogenous ceramide by disrupting ceramide glycosylation sensitizes mutant p53 cells to
drug-induced apoptosis, even though it does not significantly alter p53 protein levels, as reported previously (25)
and detected by Western blotting in this study (Figs. 2A and
B, 4B, and 5A, Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, further
assessments unveil that the levels of pp53, p53-responsive
genes (p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax, Puma), and apoptosis are all significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion (Figs. 2–4).
These evidences indicate that functional p53, but not

mitochondrial alterations, may be dominant. It is more likely
that ceramide-processing apoptosis is associated with p53dependent pathways, as we have found that ceramide
increased after MBO-asGCS treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2; ref. 29) or exogenous C6-ceramide reactivates
pp53 in nucleus and enhances p53-responsive genes including p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax, and Puma (Figs. 2–5).
Mutant p53 is a defined target for cancer therapies; however,
discovering an effective approach to restore functional p53 is a
great challenge. Mutant p53 is often expressed at high levels in
cancers, and it affects tumor progression and treatment outcome in terms of loss-of-function in tumor suppression and
gain-of-function in oncogenic effects (12, 43). Introduction of
wild-type p53 by gene therapy can correct the loss-of-function
in tumor suppression, but it cannot diminish the oncogenic
effects of mutant p53 on tumors. It has been reported that a
group of small molecular compounds (Ellipticine, CP-31398,
Prima-1) and peptides (C369–382, C361–382) modulate protein
conformations of mutant p53, reactivating its transcription
function (15, 44). CP-31398, a styrylquinazoline compound,
upregulates the expression of p53-responsive genes and
represses tumor growth through binding to DBD and stabilizing the active protein conformation in mutant p53 cells (45, 46).
Prima-1 reactivates mutant p53 (His175, His273) by covalent
binding to and modification of thiol groups in the core domain
in the H1299-His175 lung adenocarcinoma or Saos-2-His273
osteosarcoma cells (15). On the other hand, peptide C361 to
382 restores the transcriptional activity of mutant p53 by an
allosteric mechanism of negative regulation (44, 47). In this
study, we have found that ceramide mediates p53 restoration,
as silencing of GCS with MBO-asGCS can increase endogenous
ceramide (29) and C6-ceramide leads to the same restorative
effects (Figs. 2, 4, and 5).
It is not clear how ceramide restores functional p53 in
deletion mutants of p53. In addition to direct effects on
processing of apoptosis, ceramide mediates gene expressions including MDR1, telomerase, c-fos, p21Waf1/Cip1, GCS,
caspase-9, and Bcl-x (34, 35, 48, 49). Ceramide might reactivate functional p53 by modulating either mutant p53 con-

formation or wild-type p53 expression, but on the basis of
this study, it is more likely that ceramide restores wild-type
p53 expression at posttranscriptional processing. Suppression of GCS restores p53 reactivation in 12 hours to several
days (Fig. 2A) and wild-type p53 is detected in mRNA and
protein (Figs. 2, 4, and 5, Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition,
suppression of GCS does not have any effect on p53 transactivation (data not shown). These strongly suggest that
ceramide-mediated posttranscriptional processing may play
a critical role in regulating expression of wild-type or mutant
p53.
High levels of GCS and mutant p53 are coincidently
detected in several drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells lines,
such as OVCAR-8, NCI/ADR-RES, and A2780ADR, in this
study. MBO-asGCS, a specific agent for GCS suppression,
effectively restores p53-dependent apoptosis in vitro and in
vivo. Further investigating the association of GCS and mutant
p53 in drug resistance and the molecular mechanism by which
ceramide mediates p53 restoration in mutant p53 barrier
cancers may lead to discovering effective approaches to
improve cancer treatment.
