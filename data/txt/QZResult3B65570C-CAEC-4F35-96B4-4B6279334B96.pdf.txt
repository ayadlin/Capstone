ABSTRACT
The human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), encoded by the ALOX5 gene, is the key
enzyme in the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes. ALOX5 gene transcription
is strongly stimulated by calcitriol (1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and TGFβ (transforming
growth factor-β). Here, we investigated the influence of MLL (activator of transcript
initiation), AF4 (activator of transcriptional elongation) as well as of the leukemogenic
fusion proteins MLL-AF4 (ectopic activator of transcript initiation) and AF4-MLL
(ectopic activator of transcriptional elongation) on calcitriol/TGFβ-dependent 5-LO
transcript elongation. We present evidence that the AF4 complex directly interacts
with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and promotes calcitriol-dependent ALOX5 transcript
elongation. Activation of transcript elongation was strongly enhanced by the AF4-MLL
fusion protein but was sensitive to Flavopiridol. By contrast, MLL-AF4 displayed no
effect on transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, HDAC class I inhibitors inhibited
the ectopic effects caused by AF4-MLL on transcriptional elongation, suggesting that
HDAC class I inhibitors are potential therapeutics for the treatment of t(4;11)(q21;q23)
leukemia.

and by class I HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) [4, 5], an
effect which depends mainly on the recruitment of the
transcription factor Sp1 to a single cognate binding site
close to the transcriptional start site [6]. Induction of 5-LO
mRNA transcription by TSA also correlates with MLL
activation and the subsequent upregulation of H3K4me3
signatures at the ALOX5 promoter [5]. MLL-dependent
ALOX5 promoter activation is stimulated by VDR/RXR
as well as SMADs in a ligand-independent manner.
By contrast, 5-LO mRNA expression has been
described to be strongly stimulated by the respective
ligands, calcitriol and TGFβ [7]. These ligand-dependent
effects are, however, not mediated via the ALOX5
promoter but are due to enhanced transcriptional
elongation [8]. Transcriptional elongation is induced
by subsequent phosphorylation steps at Ser-5 by
TFIIH and finally at Ser-2 and Thr-4 residues of the
repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD: 52 repeats) of RNA

INTRODUCTION
Human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which is encoded
by the ALOX5 gene, catalyzes the first two steps in the
biosynthesis of the leukotrienes from arachidonic acid.
Leukotrienes are a part of the innate immune system
but are also associated with inflammatory, allergic
and cardiovascular diseases as well as certain types of
cancer [1].
The human ALOX5 gene consists of 14 exons and
13 introns, named as introns A-M, respectively [2]. The
ALOX5 promoter contains eight GC-boxes but lacks
TATA and CAAT boxes, and thus, resembles promoters of
housekeeping genes although 5-LO is mainly expressed
in leukocytes [1, 3]. 5-LO mRNA expression is regulated
at the level of transcript initiation and elongation. The
ALOX5 promoter can be activated by the pan-histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA)

polymerase  II (RNAPII) by the positive transcription
elongation factor b (P-TEFb) [9–11], a dimeric protein
consisting of CDK9 and Cyclin T1. P-TEFb is recruited to
active promoters as part of the super elongation complexes
that are composed by either AF4 (AFF1) or AF5 (AFF4),
and include - among other proteins - AF9, AF10, ELL and
the two histone methyltransferases NSD1 and DOT1L
[12–15]. The AF4 protein recruits P-TEFb from 7SK
RNP inhibitory complexes and stimulates transcriptional
elongation by increasing P-TEFb-mediated Ser-2
phosphorylation of RNAPII [12]. Of interest, the AF4
gene is frequently involved in t(4;11)(q21;q23) reciprocal
chromosomal translocations with the MLL gene [16]. The
resulting fusion proteins AF4-MLL (der4) and MLL-AF4
(der11) lead to development and maintenance of high-risk
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [14, 17–19].
Previously, we could demonstrate that MLL-AF4 is
a constitutive activator of gene transcription and induces
transcript initiation [5]. In this study, we investigated
the influence of both wild-type AF4 and MLL, as well
as of the t(4;11) fusion proteins AF4-MLL and MLLAF4 on transcriptional elongation using the recently
discovered calcitriol/TGFβ-dependent elongation of
ALOX5 transcripts as an experimental model system.
We found that the AF4 complex directly interacts
with the VDR (vitamin D receptor) and acts on 5-LO
transcript elongation. Not surprisingly, the AF4-MLL
fusion protein mimics the function of the AF4 complex,

however, in a much more enhanced and stringent way.
Class I HDACi inhibited AF4-MLL-induced 5-LO
transcriptional elongation, which indicates that these
inhibitors are able to attenuate the aberrant epigenetic
activity of AF4-MLL. Thus, HDACi are not only
blocking the actions deriving from MLL-AF4 [5], but
also that of AF4-MLL. Therefore, our results suggest that
class I HDAC inhibition might be an interesting option
for the therapy of t(4;11)(q21;q23) leukemias.

RESULTS
MLL-AF4 activates the 5-LO promoter whereas
AF4-MLL leads to calcitriol/TGFβ-dependent
5-LO transcript elongation
In order to study the effects of MLL and its
oncogenic counterparts on ALOX5 transcript initiation and
elongation, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with
the pN10 (Figures 1, 2A), pN10cdsInJM (Figures 1, 2B) or
the pGL3cdsInJM (Figures 1, 2C) luciferase reporter gene
construct and co-transfected either with pTarget (empty
vector control) or pTarget-based expression vectors for
AF4, MLL, AF4-MLL or MLL-AF4. The 5-LO promoter/
reporter gene vector pN10 contains the ALOX5 promoter
sequence from -778 to +53 (relative to the transcriptional
start site) fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Activity of

the constructs by calcitriol/TGFβ, HeLa cells were co-transfected either with the pSG5 control vector or with the expression vectors for the
nuclear receptors VDR and RXR. 16 hours after transfection, cells were incubated without or with calcitriol (50 nM) and TGFβ (1 ng/ml). After

this construct is not elongation controlled because it
was not sensitive to Flavopiridol treatment (see also
Figure 8B). Therefore, this construct allows to measure
transcript initiation selectively. The second reporter
gene construct pN10cdsInJM and the third promoterless
construct pGL3cdsInJM contain both the coding sequence
as well as the last four introns of the ALOX5 gene, a region
which has already been shown to be strictly elongation
controlled [8].
As already shown previously, in the absence of
co-transfected VDR/RXR, ALOX5 promoter activity
was strongly induced by MLL-AF4, whereas the activity
was unaffected by AF4, MLL and AF4-MLL expression
(Figure 2A, left panel). Interestingly, VDR/RXR
coexpression strongly induced ALOX5 promoter activity
together with MLL and MLL-AF4 but less with AF4
and AF4-MLL (Figure 2A, middle panel). These effects
are not dependent on calcitriol/TGFβ (Figure 2A, right
panel). Taken together, the results confirm our previous
observation, that MLL-AF4 strongly stimulates 5-LO
promoter activity. Additionally, we found here that VDR/
RXR support 5-LO promoter activation by MLL and
MLL-AF4 in a ligand-independent manner.
Next, we analyzed the reporter gene constructs
pN10cdsInJM (Figure 2B) and pGL3cdsInJM (Figure 2C).
Similar to the pN10 reporter construct, MLL-AF4 expression
induced activity of both reporter gene constructs (Figure 2B
and 2C, left panels). However, the absolute activity was
much lower than with pN10. Interestingly, VDR/RXR
coexpression enhanced the effects of MLL and AF4-MLL,
but not MLL-AF4 in both elongation controlled reporter
gene constructs (Figure 2B and 2C, middle panels) indicating
that this effect can be attributed to either the N-terminal
portion of AF4 or the C-terminal portion of MLL.
Of note, in contrast to pN10, we observed strong
ligand dependent effects with both elongation-controlled
constructs (Figure 2B and 2C, right panels). Thus,
calcitriol/TGFβ stimulated reporter gene activity up to
4-fold when AF4, MLL or MLL-AF4 were co-expressed.
The most remarkable effect was obtained in the presence
of AF4-MLL, where a strong, up to 14-fold VDR/RXRdependent induction of reporter gene activity was observed
by calcitriol/TGFβ (Figure 2B and 2C, right panels). The
data suggest that transcript elongation, but not initiation is
stimulated by calcitriol/TGFβ and that AF4-MLL strongly
enhances the calcitriol/TGFβ effects.

(Figure 3A), but not from the elongation controlled
plasmids pN10cdsInJM and pGL3cdsInJM (Figure 3B
and 3C). Moreover, we did not see any ligand-dependent
effects under our assay conditions (Figure 3A–3C). The
data suggest that SMADs enhance transcript initiation but
do not stimulate transcript elongation.

Calcitriol is the critical ligand for VDR/RXR
mediated induction by AF4-MLL
ALOX5 is known for long as a calcitriol/TGFβ
responsive gene [7, 20–22]. Since calcitriol/TGFβ strongly
stimulate 5-LO transcript elongation, we investigated the
effects of either TGFβ or calcitriol on the AF4-MLLmediated ALOX5 gene induction in order to identify
whether these ligand-dependent effects are due to calcitriol
or TGFβ or to the combination of both agents. HeLa cells
were transiently transfected with pGL3cdsInJM, the VDR/
RXR expression plasmids and either with empty vector
(pTarget) or the expression vectors for AF4 or AF4-MLL.
Subsequently, we studied the effects of calcitriol, TGFβ
or the combination of both compounds. As shown in
Figure 4, combined incubation with calcitriol/TGFβ led to
a highly significant induction of reporter gene activity in
the presence of AF4-MLL. Interestingly, calcitriol alone
exhibited a similar induction, whereas TGFβ showed
no effect under these conditions. The data suggest that
stimulation of 5-LO transcript elongation is due to vitamin
D- and not TGFβ-signalling.

Inhibition of proteasomal degradation attenuates
the difference between AF4 and AF4-MLL
Under physiological conditions, the AF4 protein is
produced, forms the AF4 complex, activates the process
of transcriptional elongation, and is subsequently rapidly
degraded via binding to the E3 ligases SIAH1 or SIAH2,
respectively. The proteasomal degradation pathway is so
fast that endogenous AF4 cannot be visualized in Western
blot experiments [23]. In order to check whether the lower
induction of transcript elongation by AF4 as compared to
AF4-MLL is due to proteasomal degradation of AF4 and a
subsequent lower cellular expression level, we transiently
transfected HeLa cells with pGL3cdsInJM, VDR/RXR
expression plasmids and expression vectors for AF4 or
AF4-MLL. The transfected cells were incubated with
calcitriol/TGFβ and with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(5 μM) for different time periods (1 h, 6 h and a maximum
of 16 h). The treatment of HeLa cells with MG132 for
16 hours resulted in an increase in AF4-mediated activities
leading to similar effects as with AF4-MLL (Figure 5).
Furthermore, treatment with MG132 also stimulated
the activity of empty vector transfected cells, due to an
about 4-fold stabilization of endogenous AF4 protein
(measured with the AFF1 ELISA Kit, data not shown).

SMAD effects
Since calcitriol as well as TGFβ induce cellular
5-LO mRNA expression, we studied the role of SMAD3/
SMAD4 in all three reporter systems (compare Figure 2).
In contrast to VDR/RXR, expression of SMAD3 and
SMAD4 only supported the stimulation of pN10 (pure
promoter construct) by MLL, AF4-MLL and MLL-AF4

In order to study inducibility of the constructs by calcitriol/TGFβ, HeLa cells were co-transfected either with the pCGN control

The data suggest that the N-terminal part of AF4 mediates
stimulation of transcript elongation and that the lower
activity of AF4 compared to the oncogenic fusion protein
AF4-MLL is due to its rapid proteasomal degradation,
while the AF4-MLL fusion protein is not being degraded
via the proteasomal pathway [23].

ectopic overexpression of AF4 or AF4-MLL and a
subsequent incubation with calcitriol/TGFβ revealed
no differences between AF4 knockdown and wild-type
HeLa cells (Figure 6B), indicating that transfected AF4
or AF4-MLL was able to complement the knockdown of
endogenous AF4.

Knockdown of AF4 reduces basal activity of
transcript elongation

AF4 interacts with the VDR
Since we observed a VDR/RXR-dependent
induction of transcription by calcitriol that was strongly
stimulated by AF4 and AF4-MLL, we wondered whether
VDR/RXR is able to directly interact with AF4. In order
to verify that the VDR/RXR heterodimer and AF4 are
interaction partners, we performed a Co-IP experiment.
HEK293T cells were transfected with the expression
plasmids for AF4 as well as the nuclear receptors VDR
and/or RXR. Cells lysates were incubated with an
antibody against VDR or RXR and immunoprecipitation
was performed with Protein-G-Agarose. Subsequently
performed Western blot experiments revealed that AF4 was
not present in the precipitates of RXR-transfected cells,

To address the role of AF4 in ALOX5 transcript
elongation, a stable knockdown of endogenous AF4 was
performed. As shown in Figure 6A the shRNA-mediated
knockdown of AF4 resulted in a reduction of about 50%
at the mRNA level, and a reduction of about 45% at the
protein level. AF4 knockdown cells led to reduced cell
viability and proliferation rate when compared with
wild-type HeLa cells (data not shown). Knockdown
cells transfected with pGL3cdsInJM and VDR/RXR
displayed a significantly reduced basal reporter activity
compared to wild-type cells, thus supporting that AF4
is crucial for 5-LO transcript elongation. In contrast,

but was weakly present in precipitates of VDR-transfected
cells. Interestingly, immunoprecipitates from VDR/RXR
transfected cells display a prominent AF4 signal after
immunoprecipitation with VDR antibody whereas a
weaker signal was obtained when the RXR antibody was
used, suggesting that VDR/RXR heterodimers serve as an
AF4 or AF4 complex docking site and that VDR could
be the component of the VDR/RXR heterodimer which
mediates this interaction (Figure 7).

calcitriol/TGFβ-mediated 5-LO mRNA induction is mainly
associated with enhanced transcriptional elongation, we
investigated here whether HDAC inhibitors modulate
AF4-MLL-dependent stimulation of transcript elongation
by calcitriol. To distinguish between the ‘transcript
initiation’ and ‘transcript elongation’ processes, we used
the CDK9 inhibitor Flavopiridol [24]. HeLa cells were
transiently transfected with pGL3cdsInJM plus the VDR/
RXR expression plasmids (Figure 8A and 8B, left graph)
or the pN10 reporter plasmid (Figure 8B, right graph).
Additionally, we included either pTarget (empty vector)
or the expression vector for AF4-MLL as indicated. The
cells were then incubated for 24 h with calcitriol/TGFβ,
different HDAC inhibitors or Flavopiridol. The applied
HDAC inhibitors show different selectivities for the
various HDAC isoforms: MC-1568 is an inhibitor of
class IIa HDACs; Apicidin inhibits HDAC1, HDAC2,
HDAC3 and HDAC8; MS-275 (Entinostat) preferentially

earlier observations where the main effect exerted by the
AF4-MLL fusion protein is the activation of transcriptional
elongation [14]. Interestingly, Flavopiridol was not able to
inhibit reporter gene activity with the ALOX5 promoter
plasmid pN10, suggesting that transcription from this
particular plasmid is not P-TEFb-dependent (Figure 8B,
right graph). This is supported by experiments where
pN10 was co-transfected with either AF4- or AF4-MLL.
Again, there was no stimulation of reporter gene activity
by these plasmids, indicating that the process of ‘transcript
initiation’ at the ALOX5 promoter is not P-TEFb
dependent, while the elongation control system residing
within the ALOX5 intron J-M region depends on P-TEFb.
Furthermore, the reporter gene data suggest that HDAC
class I inhibitors strongly block AF4-MLL-mediated 5-LO
transcript elongation by calcitriol and TGFβ.

MM6 cells were cultured without or with calcitriol/
TGFβ in conjunction with the indicated inhibitors.
As shown in Figure 9A, treatment of MM6 cells with
HDAC1–3 inhibitors or with Flavopiridol caused a
significant reduction of 5-LO mRNA expression in
calcitriol/TGFβ-treated cells. As expected, inhibition
of 5-LO mRNA expression by class I HDAC inhibitors
and Flavopiridol also led to a decrease in 5-LO protein
expression (Figure 9B) and to a remarkable inhibition
of 5-LO enzyme activity (Figure 9C). This proved
again, that the ALOX5 gene that encodes for 5-LO, a
key player for the inflammatory response in humans,
is tightly regulated at the level of transcript initiation
and elongation and that the inhibition of 5-LO mRNA
expression in calcitriol/TGFβ-differentiated MM6 cells
by HDAC class I inhibitors seems to be due to inhibition
of transcript elongation.

monocytic cell line MM6 cells. Previous data have
shown that HDAC class I inhibitors stimulate the 5-LO
promoter [4, 5] and here we found that these inhibitors
block 5-LO transcript elongation by calcitriol/TGFβ.
This is in line with the observation that the pan HDAC
inhibitor TSA enhances basal but inhibits calcitriol/
TGFβ-induced 5-LO expression in MM6 cells [4]. In
order to investigate whether HDAC class I inhibitors are
able to block 5-LO mRNA induction by calcitriol/TGFβ,

Finally, we wanted to investigate the influence of
HDAC inhibitors or Flavopiridol on a cell line carrying
a t(4;11) chromosomal translocation. Therefore, the acute
monocytic leukemia cell line MV4–11 was differentiated
with calcitriol/TGFβ in the presence of the indicated
HDAC inhibitors or Flavopiridol. Then, expression of
5-LO mRNA was analysed by real-time PCR. As shown
in Figure 10, treatment of MV4–11 cells with HDAC1–3
inhibitors or with Flavopiridol caused a significant
reduction of 5-LO mRNA expression and confirmed the
data obtained with MM6 cells.

DISCUSSION

due to its short half-life, AF4 expression in the cells is low
even after ectopic expression and it cannot be detected by
Western blot. Consequently, we stabilized AF4 with the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 and we observed that in
the presence of MG132, AF4 exhibits similar induction
of transcript elongation as AF4-MLL suggesting that the
lower activity of AF4 mainly reflects its lower biological
stability.
Calcitriol exclusively stimulates 5-LO transcript
elongation but not initiation [8, 22]. This conclusion
was further confirmed here with the P-TEFb inhibitor
Flavopiridol which did not inhibit reporter gene activity
when using the 5-LO promoter plasmid but strongly
reduced the calcitriol/TGFβ-dependent induction of
reporter activities with both elongation controlled reporter
gene plasmids. From these experiments it became clear
that all effects deriving from calcitriol/TGFβ signaling
pathways directly affect the process of transcriptional
elongation, but not the process of transcript initiation.
The strong enhancement of the calcitriol effect in the
elongation controlled reporter plasmids by coexpression of
AF4 (after proteasome inhibition) or AF4-MLL suggests
that the N-terminal part can mediate the stimulation of
5-LO transcript elongation by calcitriol. Of note, our data
also suggest that the observed calcitriol effect depends on
the presence of both nuclear receptors VDR and RXR,
since only marginal effects of the ligand were observed
when VDR/RXR was not co-expressed in our test system.

5-LO is expressed in mature leukocytes which is
in agreement with the function of LTs as mediators of
innate immune reactions. During myeloid cell maturation,
expression of 5-LO mRNA and protein is strongly
upregulated by calcitriol and TGFβ [7, 20–22]. Initial
studies demonstrated that this upregulation is not caused
by 5-LO promoter activation [31] but by the stimulation
of transcriptional elongation [8, 22].
However, at present, it is unclear how nuclear
receptor signalling is linked with transcript elongation.
AF4 was previously shown to be a key component of
the super elongation complex which stimulates transcript
elongation by recruiting P-TEFb (a heterodimer of
CDK9 and cyclin T1) to arrested RNA polymerase II
(RNAPII) and converts it into the elongating form by
phosphorylation at Ser-2 of the carboxyterminal domain.
Here, we provide evidence that AF4 links nuclear
receptor signaling with the process of transcriptional
elongation. We demonstrate that the VDR/RXR
heterodimer can directly interact with AF4 and that
especially AF4-MLL supports transcript elongation
in a vitamin D3 dependent manner. Of note, when we
compared the effects of AF4 with AF4-MLL, the latter
led to much higher vitamin D effects. It is described that
the AF4-MLL protein accumulates in the cell, since it is
resistant to proteasomal degradation [23]. Unfortunately,

This is supported by our coimmunoprecipitation
experiments where a strong signal for AF4 was observed
when the cells were co-transfected with both VDR and
RXR. The strongest AF4 signal was obtained after
immunoprecipitation by the VDR antibody and less
by RXR antibody suggesting that the VDR might be
the component of the VDR/RXR heterodimer which is
responsible for the interaction with the AF4 complex. On
the other hand one has to keep in mind that the different
signal intensities could be simply due to different
immunoprecipitation efficiencies of the VDR and RXR
antibodies.
Taken together, we could demonstrate for the first
time that vitamin D signaling is directly linked to transcript
elongation. Indeed, careful review of the literature reveals
that only a few of the vitamin D regulated genes show
strong changes in transcription initiation (determined
by nuclear run-off). In many cases there are only weak
effects of calcitriol on transcription initiation that
correspond to rather strong changes in steady state mRNA
levels suggesting that upregulation of mRNA expression
by calcitriol does not generally occur at the level of
transcription initiation [32, 33]. As an example, changes
in the steady state level of alkaline phosphatase mRNA
was investigated in detail and attributed to the stabilization
of newly synthesized transcripts [34].
Finally we analysed the influence of different
HDAC inhibitors on 5-LO transcript elongation, as it is
described that HDACs modulate the function of P-TEFb
by deacetylation of certain lysine residues [35, 36]. Here
we found that class I HDAC inhibitors abrogate the AF4dependent activation of 5-LO transcript elongation by
calcitriol/TGFβ in the respective reporter gene assays, as
well as 5-LO mRNA and protein expression and cellular
enzyme activity in Mono Mac 6 cells. These data suggest
that deacetylation steps catalysed by class I HDACs are
required for stimulation of transcript elongation. It was
reported that the VDR/RXR heterodimer can recruit
HDAC3 upon activation with calcitriol [37]. Thus, a
possible explanation could be that recruitment of HDAC3
by VDR/RXR after activation by calcitriol mediates the
stimulation of transcript elongation. However, additional
studies will be necessary to clarify the exact mechanisms
involved in the VDR/RXR-mediated regulation of
transcript elongation.
Regarding leukemia development, our data confirm
that the oncogenic translocation product AF4-MLL
strongly supports enhanced transcript elongation.
Interestingly, it has been recently shown that the
AF4-MLL fusion protein is sufficient to induce ALL in mice
and does not require the reciprocal translocation product
MLL-AF4 [17]. Another study found that MLL-AF4
enhances the transcription of RUNX1 which then
cooperates with AF4-MLL. Thus, it could well be that
elevated levels of RUNX1 protein render the MLL-AF4
fusion protein dispensable for the malignant transformation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

process. Under conditions of low RUNX1 expression,
MLL-AF4 will be required to trigger the RUNX1/AF4-MLL
pathway [19].
One hallmark of AF4-MLL is the functional
hyperactivation of P-TEFb, which subsequently leads to
enhanced transcript elongation by phosphorylation of RNA
polymerase II at Ser2 of the CTD [14]. Our observation
that HDAC class I inhibitors block aberrant transcript
elongation caused by AF4-MLL suggests that HDAC
class I inhibitors might be of considerable therapeutic
interest for t(4,11)-leukemias. This is supported by our
recent finding that class I HDAC inhibitors also attenuate
the aberrant transcriptional activity of MLL-AF4 and
strongly inhibit ALL cell growth [5]. Interestingly,
these results are line with a recent investigation where
gene expression profiling data of t(4;11) leukemia cells
were related to connectivity maps. This type of analyses
revealed that MLL leukemia cells could profit from
HDACi [38]. Here, we provide the molecular mechanism
how HDAC inhibitors counteract the oncogenic functions
of the AF4-MLL fusion proteins on transcript elongation.
Taken together, the present data suggest that HDAC class
I inhibitors might have a considerable potential for the
treatment of t(4, 11) leukemias.

Stable knockdown of AF4 in HeLa cells by
lentiviral transduction

genomic DNA from MM6 cells, which was already
described elsewhere [39]. Expression plasmids for the
human vitamin D receptor (pSG5-VDR) and retinoid X
receptor alpha (pSG5-RXR) were kindly provided from
C. Carlberg (Kuopio, Finland). The renilla luciferase
control vector pRL-SV40 was purchased from Promega.
Expression vectors for full-length AF4, MLL, AF4-MLL
and MLL-AF4 were gained as recently described [5]. All
expression cassettes are flanked by the rare-cutting Sfi1
sites and were cloned in a Sfi1 restriction site-modified
pTarget vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) [40].

MISSION shRNA plasmid for AF4 knockdown
(NM_005935.1–3282s1c1: TRCN0000021975)  was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. HEK293T cells were
transfected with 10 μg shRNA plasmid, 6.5 μg
lentiviral packaging vector pCMV-dR8.91 and 3.5  μg
envelope plasmid pMD2.G by calcium phosphate
precipitation method. The medium was changed 4 hours
after transfection and supernatant was collected after
72 hours. For transduction, 4 × 104 HeLa cells in 1 ml
medium per well were prepared in 24-well plates and
were treated after 24 hours with 4 μg/ml protamine
sulfate and 10, 50, 100 or 500 μl supernatant including
lentiviral particles. The cells were centrifuged (90 min,
2500 rpm, 32°C) and cultured for 72 hours. Selection
of transduced cells was performed by puromycin
(0.75 μg/ml) and knockdown efficiency was checked by
quantitative PCR analysis with a StepOnePlusTM System
(Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). The sequences
of the AF4 primers were 5′-ATGTCCGGCCCATGGAT
(forward) and 5′-GGCAGGCACTTTCAAGTCTGT
(reverse). Results were normalized to β-actin Ct values.
Sequences of the β-actin primers were as follows:
5′-CGGGACCTGACTGACTACCTC (forward) and
5′-CTTCTCCTTAATGTCACGCACG (reverse). Each
sample was set up in triplicates. The mRNA expression
was quantified by comparative ∆∆CT method with three
independent real-time PCR experiments. Knockdown
of AF4 protein expression was quantified in three
independent experiments via AFF1 ELISA Kit according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Reagents
Calcitriol (17936) and the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al, C2211) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany. Human TGFβ1
was purified from platelets according to [41]. TSA (SigmaAldrich: T1952), MC-1568 (Sigma-Aldrich: M1824),
Apicidin (Sigma-Aldrich: A8851), MS-275 (Enzo Life
Sciences, Lörrach, Germany: ALX-270–378-M005),

USA: 10444), Mocetinostat (Selleckchem, München,
Germany: S1122), Droxinostat (Selleckchem: S1422) and
Flavopiridol (Sigma-Aldrich: F3055) were all dissolved in
DMSO (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany: A3006). AFF1
ELISA Kit (E98872Hu) was obtained from USCN Life
Science, Wuhan, Hubei, PRC.

Calcium phosphate transfection and reporter
gene assay
24 hours prior to transfection, HeLa cells were
seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well in 24-well
plates by using 1 ml of the cell line specific medium
without phenol red. Transient transfection of the cells
with 225 ng 5-LO firefly luciferase reporter gene
construct (pN10, pN10cdsInJM or pGL3cdsInJM), 225 ng
expression vector (pTarget, pT-AF4, pT-MLL, pT-AF4MLL or pT-MLL-AF4), 50 ng nuclear receptor expression
vector (pSG5 or pSG5-VDR/pSG5-RXR, pCGN or pCGNSMAD3/pCGN-SMAD4) and 20 ng renilla luciferase
control vector (pRL-SV40) per well was performed by
calcium phosphate precipitation method [42]. The medium
was changed 16 hours after transfection and the cells were
incubated without or with 50 nM calcitriol and 1 ng/ml
TGFβ and additionally with inhibitors, if indicated in
the figures. 40 hours after transfection firefly and renilla
luciferase activity was determined with the Dual-Glo®
Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a TECAN
infinite® M200 luminometer. Data were calculated as
relative light units (RLU) by normalization of transfection
efficiency with the values of renilla luciferase activity in at
least three independent experiments.

Co-IP experiments
1 × 107 HEK293T cells were transiently transfected
with 10 μg of the expression plasmid for AF4 and 5 μg
each of the expression plasmids for the nuclear receptors
VDR and/or RXR and cells were grown for 48 hours. For
immunoprecipitation, nuclear extracts were normalized to
1 mg aliquots of total protein concentration per antibody.
All samples were pre-cleared by addition of 1 μg
non-specific IgG and 20 μl Protein-G-Agarose (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated for 30 min at 4°C
under rotation. Supernatants were collected and 1 μg of
RXR antibody (Santa Cruz: sc-553) and/or VDR antibody
(Santa Cruz: sc-1008) were added and further incubated
for 1 hour. 25 μl of Protein-G-Agarose were added and
incubated for additional 2 hours. Pellets were washed
three times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling for
5 minutes in 2 x Laemmli-buffer. Input and eluate samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by Western
blot analysis for RXR, VDR and AF4.

200 ng of prostaglandin B1 (internal standard). Finally,
5-LO metabolites were extracted by a C-18 solidphase extraction column and analyzed by HPLC as
described previously [43]. 5-LO product formation was
determined as the amount of 5-LO products measured
as nanograms produced per 106 cells, which include
leukotriene B4 (LTB4), the all-trans-isomers of LTB4
and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). Each
experiment was performed at least three times for
calculation of mean and SEM.

MM6 cells or MV4–11 were seeded at a density
of 2 × 105 cells/ml and incubated for 24 hours without
or with 50 nM calcitriol, 1 ng/ml TGFβ and with the
indicated inhibitors. For real-time PCR total RNA was
extracted from the cells by the Total RNA Kit from
Omega Bio-Tek (Norcross, GA, USA: R6834–02)
including DNase I digestion. 2 μg RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA using High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies: 4368814)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative
PCR analysis was performed with a StepOnePlusTM
System (Life Technologies). The sequences of the
5-LO primers were 5′-GTTCCTGAATGGCTGCAAC
(forward)
and
5′-GGCAATGGGGACAATCTTG
(reverse). Results were normalized to β-actin Ct values.
Sequences of the β-actin primers were as follows:
5′-CGGGACCTGACTGACTACCTC (forward) and
5′-CTTCTCCTTAATGTCACGCACG (reverse). Each
sample was set up in triplicates. The expression was
quantified by comparative ∆∆CT method of three
independent experiments.

Statistics
Results were calculated as mean ± S.E.M. of at
least three independent experiments. Two-tailed Student’s
t-test was performed to determine the significance between
two groups. One sample t-test was performed to analyse
significance of AF4 knockdown. Thereby, statistical
significance was illustrated as follows: *P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
