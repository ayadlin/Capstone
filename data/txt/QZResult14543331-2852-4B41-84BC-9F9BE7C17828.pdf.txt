ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and remains
a major cause of mortality, thus necessitating further therapeutic advancements. In
breast cancer, numerous cell signaling pathways are aberrantly activated to produce
the myriad phenotypes associated with malignancy; such pathways include the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR, NF-κB and JAK/STAT cascades. These pathways are highly interconnected,
but one prominent lateral enhancer of each is the remarkably promiscuous kinase
CK2. CK2 expression has been shown to be elevated in cancer, thus implicating it
in tumorigenesis through its effects on oncogenic signaling cascades. In this study,
we identify aberrant expression of CK2 subunits in human breast samples from The
Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Additionally, two specific small molecule inhibitors of
CK2, CX-4945 and TBB, were used to examine the role of CK2 in two human breast
cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. We show that CK2 inhibition attenuates
constitutive PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NF-κB and STAT3 activation and inducible NF-κB and
JAK/STAT activation and downstream transcriptional activity. CX-4945 treatment
caused a range of phenotypic changes in these cell lines, including decreased viability,
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and loss of migratory capacity. Overall, these results
demonstrate the tremendous potential of CK2 as a clinical target in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

formation [3]. Of the seven STATs, STAT3 is by far the
most prominent in cancer [4]. STAT3 upregulates a broad
repertoire of genes with diverse functions, including cell
growth (c-Myc), apoptosis resistance (Bcl-2), migration/
invasion (MMP2, 9), angiogenesis (VEGF) [5] and
inflammation (IL-6) [4]. Activated STAT3 thus has a
striking ability to promote cancer cell survival, invasion,
and stemness while suppressing anti-tumor immunity [4,
6]. In accordance with STAT3’s pro-cancerous properties,
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is
observed in nearly a third of breast adenocarcinomas and
is an indicator of poor prognosis [7]. STAT3 activation
is also associated more with advanced breast cancer, as
opposed to STAT5, which is more prominently involved
in tumor initiation [3].
NF-κB is a family of transcription factors composed
of five members, the most important of which in cancer

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer in women worldwide and remains a clinically
challenging disease because of distant metastases and the
extreme heterogeneity of tumors referred to as “breast
cancer.” Recent classification studies have proposed 10 and
4 molecular subtypes of breast cancer [1, 2], and neither
classification scheme fully accounts for the complexity
of the diverse cellular signaling pathways driving cancer
growth and progression. Numerous pathways, such as the
NF-κB, JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways, help drive at
least some breast tumors. This extreme diversity points
to the need to continue developing molecularly targeted
therapies.

is the p65 (RelA) and p50 heterodimer. This dimer is
normally found in the cytoplasm, as it is sequestered
there by the Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) proteins. Activation
of the pathway by a stimulus such as TNF-α causes
activation of the IKK complex, which phosphorylates
IκB, thus targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation. Then, p65 is phosphorylated at serine 536 and
activated; it can then translocate into the nucleus, causing
transcription of numerous genes such as IL-6 and IL-8
[8]. A myriad of NF-κB target genes have been implicated
in cancer pathogenesis and progression. Indeed, NF-κB
itself has been demonstrated numerous times to drive procancerous inflammation, prosurvival signals and radiation
resistance [9, 10].
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is one of the
most commonly dysregulated pathways in cancer. This
prosurvival signaling cascade can be activated in response
to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines and growth
factors [11]. Genetic lesions in genes associated with this
pathway, such as PIK3CA and PTEN, are among the most
common such aberrations in breast cancer [2]. As such,
inhibition of this pathway is a clinical priority, particularly
as overactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has
been associated with drug resistance in breast cancer [12,
13].
CK2 is a constitutively active, ubiquitous serine/
threonine kinase most often found as a tetramer composed
of two catalytic subunits (α and/or α’) and two regulatory
subunits (the β subunit). CK2 is highly pleiotropic [14]:
it has nearly 450 known substrates [15] and may target
over 20% of the phosphoproteome, according to a recent
bioinformatic analysis [16]. CK2 is also found in nearly
every subcellular compartment [17], and knockout of
CK2α or CK2β is embryonic lethal [18, 19]. Given
the enormous importance of CK2 in normal cells, its
importance in neoplastic cells may hardly be surprising.
CK2 levels are elevated in every cancer type evaluated to
date [14], including breast cancer [20]. CK2 seems to be a
superb example [14] of non-oncogene addiction [21], as it
enhances every one of Hanahan and Weinberg’s hallmarks
of cancer [22-24] and underpins multi-drug resistance [14,
25]. CK2 is a “lateral” (non-hierarchical and therefore
atypical) kinase [26] that affects numerous pathways vital
in cancer [22].
We recently discovered that CK2 is a novel
interaction partner with JAK1 and JAK2. CK2 inhibition
was thus able to prevent STAT3 activation and downstream
gene activation in various cell types, including triplenegative breast cancer cells [27]. CK2 is also known to
target the NF-κB pathway at multiple points, including
IκBs, IKKs and p65 itself [28]. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway is also intimately intertwined with CK2.
CK2 phosphorylates Akt at serine 129, causing Akt to
become hyperactive [22]; Akt also phosphorylates CK2,
causing CK2 to promote rRNA synthesis [29]. PTEN is
a CK2 target, and its modulation causes stabilization and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(somewhat paradoxically) inactivation of PTEN [30].
Cylene Pharmaceuticals developed a first-inclass, orally bioavailable inhibitor of CK2 [31]. This
highly selective drug, called CX-4945 (Silmitasertib)
is the first CK2 inhibitor to enter clinical trials [32]. In
vitro studies of CX-4945 provide evidence for its ability
to attenuate diverse pro-cancerous signaling pathways
and to decrease breast cancer cell viability in a manner
positively correlating with the CK2 levels of the specific
cell line [31]. CX-4945 also decreases IL-6 serum levels
and STAT3 levels in an inflammatory breast cancer model
[33]. We have demonstrated that CX-4945 decreases NFκB, PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT3 signaling in glioma and
increases survival time in an intracranial murine model
of glioma [34]. Finally, recent data from a phase I clinical
trial in solid tumors initiated by Cylene Pharmaceuticals
show that CX-4945 treatment, which produced minimal
side-effects, reduced circulating tumor cell count and
CK2-related pro-cancerous signaling while also stabilizing
disease in a fifth of patients in a way that strongly
correlated with decreased IL-6 and IL-8 levels [35].
These extremely promising results point to the extreme
importance of both CK2 and its numerous interwoven
signaling targets in tumor growth and progression.
In this study, we identify widespread genetic
aberrations in CK2 genes in human breast cancers
in a subtype-specific manner and characterize CK2
protein levels in two human breast cancer cell lines. We
demonstrate that small molecule inhibition of CK2 by
CX-4945 and TBB can attenuate an array of constitutive
signaling pathways as well as inducible JAK/STAT and
NF-κB signaling. Finally, we show that inhibition of CK2
with CX-4945 causes cell cycle arrest and decreased cell
viability in human breast cancer cell lines, as well as
changing cell morphology and migratory capacity. CK2
thus appears to be a vital foundation of multiple aspects
of cancer cell biology and a target worthy of further
investigation.

RESULTS
CK2 Subunits Are Differentially Upregulated in
Human Breast Cancers
The statuses of the CK2 subunits were initially
analyzed in human breast cancer from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) [2]. A large fraction of tumors
demonstrate copy number variation (CNV) in one or more
CK2 genes (Figure 1A). Approximately 30% and 20% of
breast tumors have gains on CSNK2A1 (encoding CK2α)
and CSNK2B (CK2β), respectively, while fewer gains are
seen on CSNK2A2 (CK2α’). Unexpectedly, a large number
of tumors also possess heterozygous deletions of CK2
genes: most prominently, CSNK2A2 is lost in nearly 60%
6485

of tumors. Losses at CSNK2A1 and CSNK2B are more
modest (~15%). The correlation between copy number and
mRNA expression was also examined, and it was found
that copy number significantly correlated with expression
for all three genes (p<10-20), as shown in Figure 1B.
In order to better understand this unusual
distribution of CNV, CNV was examined by breast cancer
molecular subtype (Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2-enriched
and Basal). Figure 1C shows significant depletions/
enrichments exist for two subtypes, Luminal A and Basal.
Luminal A appears to be enriched for CSNK2A2 loss and
depleted for CSNK2B gains, whereas Basal is exactly
reversed. No significant enrichments/depletions were
observed for CSNK2A1. These results would suggest that
Basal breast tumors would possess higher levels of CK2
as compared to non-Basal, and indeed, higher expression
of all three subunits is observed in this subtype (data not
shown). These data are intriguing because they suggest
that the Basal subtype, which has fewer treatment options
and therefore a more dire prognosis [2], may be highly
susceptible to CK2 inhibition.

The former is triple negative, while the latter is hormone
receptor positive. Considering the interesting contrasts in
CK2 subunit expression described in Figure 1, we sought
to profile CK2 status in these two breast cancer lines.
First, CNV for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was examined
for CK2 genes using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(Figure 2A) [36]. Both cell lines demonstrate heterozygous
loss of CSNK2A2. MCF-7 cells additionally have a
heterozygous loss of CSNK2A1, while MDA-MB-231
cells have gains on CSNK2B. Next, in Figure 2B, CK2α, α’
and β expression was compared for MDA-MB-231, MCF7, MCF-10A (an immortalized breast epithelium line) and
various normal murine tissues. It has been previously
reported that CK2 expression/activity is highest in the
brain [37], and our results confirm that CK2 expression in
the brain is high. Indeed, among normal tissue, CK2α’ was
only detectable in the brain. However, the three altered
breast lines seem to have extraphysiological expression of
CK2, even in comparison with the brain, thus confirming
that CK2 expression is elevated in cancerous tissues.
A CK2 kinase assay was performed in order to
determine the catalytic activity of CK2 in the MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines. CK2α and CK2α’ were
immunoprecipitated from protein lysates (200 μg) from
each cell line, and as seen in Figure 2C, MDA-MB-231
cells have a far higher (>4 times) rate of CK2 kinase
activity than MCF-7 cells.

Characterization of CK2 Status in Human Breast
Cancer Cell Lines
In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of
CK2 inhibition, we utilized two commonly used human
breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells.

CK2 Inhibition Causes Widespread Attenuation
of Constitutive Prosurvival Signaling

in human breast cancer cell lines, we sought to establish
the cell signaling consequences of CK2 inhibition on the
line possessing the highest CK2 expression and activity,
MDA-MB-231. Multiple signaling pathways are known
to drive breast cancer, including MAPK, Akt/mTOR, NFκB and JAK/STAT. In order to evaluate these signaling

After having characterized the relative levels of
the various CK2 subunits and CK2 enzymatic activity

Figure 2: CK2 Expression Is Elevated in Human Breast Cancer Cells Compared to Normal Tissue. A, Copy number

variations of CSNK2A1, CSNK2A2, and CSNK2B were determined by interrogating the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia by cBioPortal using
the GISTIC algorithm. B, Levels of CK2α, α’ and β were examined by immunoblot for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells, MCF-10A immortalized human breast epithelium cells, and perfused, normal murine tissues, including brain, heart, liver, lung, spleen
and uterus. Densitometry was performed, and normal brain was used to determine fold change. C, CK2α and CK2α’ were pulled down
from 200 μg of lysate from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. The immunoprecipate was then used in a CK2 activity assay which measures
incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into a CK2 substrate peptide using a scintillation counter. Assay performed in duplicate. *, p<.001.

a loading control for each protein located above it in the panels. Densitometric quantifications for each phosphoprotein are shown, with

pathways’ response to CK2 inhibition, MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with 2, 5 and 10 μM of CX-4945 for
4 h, and components of each of the above pathways
were evaluated by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure
3, CX-4945 inhibition of CK2 resulted in widespread
decreases in activation of each these pathways. To
confirm that CK2 was indeed inhibited by CX-4945
treatment, p-S529-p65 and p-S129-Akt levels were
evaluated (Figure 3A), as these phosphorylation sites are
known CK2-specific sites. Serine 529 phosphorylation is
associated with full transcriptional capacity of p65, and
serine 129 phosphorylation of Akt is thought to produce a
hyperactive state in Akt [22]. Constitutive phosphorylation
of both of these sites was dose-dependently decreased by
CX-4945 treatment (Figure 3A). Activation of molecules
downstream of Akt was also evaluated (Figure 3B). For
example, mTOR phosphorylation decreased in response
to CX-4945, and targets of mTORC1 - S6 kinase and 4EBP1 - were also shown to have decreased phosphorylation
upon CK2 inhibition.
In Figure 3C, it is shown that constitutive p-SSTAT3 is inhibited at higher concentrations of CX-

4945 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Although the tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT3 is usually associated with
STAT3 activation and oncogenic activity, MDA-MB-231
cells have very low levels of constitutive p-Y-STAT3;
however, p-S-STAT3 is considered necessary for full
transcriptional activation of STAT3 [38, 39], as well as
its oncogenic mitochondrial activity [40]. Phosphorylation
at serine 727 on STAT3 was shown to be MEK1,2dependent; accordingly, activation of the MEK1,2 target
ERK1,2 was evaluated and was inhibited by CX-4945
treatment (data not shown). In general, Figure 3 shows a
broad attenuation of constitutive cell signaling in human
breast cancer cells upon CK2 inhibition.

Loss of CK2 Activity Prevents Full Activation of
STAT3 and Target Gene Transcription
Although examination of constitutive cell signaling
is important for determining CK2’s control of the
phosphoproteome, in vivo cancer cells exist in a supportive
stroma bathed in a highly complex milieu of cytokines,

cells were treated for 2 h in serum-free medium with TBB at 25, 50 and 75 μM and then treated for 15 minutes with 0.5 ng/mL of OSM.
Lysates were obtained, and immunoblots performed using the indicated antibodies. B, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 2 h in serumfree medium with TBB at 25, 50 and 75 μM and then treated for 1 h with 1 ng/mL of OSM. RNA was isolated, cDNA was generated, and
q-RTPCR was performed for SOCS3. PCR was performed in triplicate: *, p<0.001. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 2 h in serumfree medium with TBB at 25, 50 and 75 μM and then treated for 1 h with 1 ng/mL of OSM. Lysates were obtained, and immunoblots

and then treated for 30 minutes with 25 ng/mL of EGF. Lysates were obtained, and immunoblots performed using the indicated antibodies.

chemokines and growth factors. Therefore, the effects of
CK2 inhibition on inducible cell signaling were examined.
Previously, we had shown that CK2 is necessary for full
activation of STATs in hematological malignancy [27]
and glioblastoma [34], and we sought to examine this
in breast cancer. As shown in Figure 4A, OSM potently
induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in MDAMB-231 cells. However, pretreatment of these cells with
TBB, another CK2 small molecule inhibitor [22], strongly
blocks STAT3 activation in a dose-dependent fashion. In
order to determine the functional relevance of this effect,
expression of SOCS3, an endogenous negative regulator
of STAT3 transcriptionally controlled by STAT3, was
determined. As shown in Figure 4B, SOCS3 levels were
induced threefold in response to OSM treatment, and TBB
treatment impressively decreased SOCS3 transcript levels
such that at 50 and 75 μM, SOCS3 transcription is below
basal levels. Consistent with this observation, SOCS3
protein levels were strongly inhibited by CK2 inhibition
(Figure 4C).
We also sought to determine whether the CK2dependency of STAT activation held for other activators
of STAT. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with EGF for

30 minutes, with or without 2 h of TBB pretreatment. As
shown in Figure 4D, EGF caused very strong activation
of STAT5, another oncogenic STAT family member [3].
TBB pretreatment blocked full activation of STAT5 in a
dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained for
STAT3 activation by LIF and IL-6 trans-signaling (data
not shown). These results indicate that CK2’s effects on
STAT activation are broad-ranging and affect multiple
STAT proteins using distinct receptors for activation.

TNF-α-induced NF-κB Activation and Target
Gene Transcription Relies on CK2
Next, we evaluated the potential of CK2 to
affect TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling. As previously
mentioned, serine 529 phosphorylation, which is
controlled by CK2, is associated with full transcriptional
activity of p65, but serine 536 phosphorylation is the
canonical marker of NF-κB activation in response to
external factors and stressors, such as TNF-α. Although
CK2 does not directly phosphorylate serine 536, its
actions on IκBs and IKKs may provide an indirect mode of
regulation [28]. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with

Figure 5: CK2 Inhibition Affects the Phosphorylation State and Transcriptional Capacity of TNF-α-induced NF-κB.
A, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 4 h in serum-free medium with CX-4945 at 2, 5 and 10 μM and then treated for 15 minutes with
1 ng/mL of TNF-α. Lysates were obtained, and immunoblots performed using the indicated antibodies. Densitometric quantifications for
each phosphoprotein are shown, with cells treated with cytokine alone serving as the reference point (100%); percent inhibition is shown.
B, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 4 h in serum-free medium with CX-4945 at 2, 5 and 10 μM and then treated for 1 h with 1 ng/
mL of TNF-α. RNA was isolated, cDNA was generated, and q-RTPCR was performed for the indicated genes. PCR was performed in
triplicate: **, p<0.001. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 48 h with 1 ng/mL of TNF-α and/or 10 μM of CX-4945. Supernatants were
collected, and ELISA was performed for the indicated cytokines. ELISA performed in triplicate: *, p≤0.01; **, p<0.001; ***, p<0.0001.
All experiments were repeated, and representative data are shown.

CX-4945 at varying concentrations for 4 h, after which
they were treated with 1 ng/mL of TNF-α for 15 minutes.
In contrast with some previous reports in other cell lines
[34, 41], serine 529 phosphorylation was not affected by
cytokine stimulation, although it was strongly inhibited by
CX-4945 (Figure 5A). Serine 536 was strongly induced by
TNF-α treatment, but CX-4945 evoked little attenuation of
this site’s levels.
CK2 inhibition seems to have an interesting,
conflicting effect on the post-translational modification
landscape of p65, and so we sought to determine what,
if any, effect this may have on the transcription of NFκB target genes. We treated MDA-MB-231 cells with
CX-4945 at varying concentrations for 4 h, followed by
1 h of TNF-α stimulation. We then examined IL-6 and
IL-8 transcript levels, two NF-κB target genes whose
circulating blood levels have been correlated with clinical
response to CX-4945 [33, 35]. Somewhat surprisingly,
CK2 inhibition dramatically decreased transcription of
these genes. Even at low levels of CX-4945, IL-6 and
IL-8 transcription decreased by over 50% (Figure 5B).

Because of these strong effects at the transcriptional level,
IL-6 and IL-8 protein levels were examined by ELISA.
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 48 h without or with
TNF-α and/or CX-4945. Supernatants were collected,
and secreted cytokine quantified. As shown in Figure 5C,
CX-4945 blocked production of these two interleukins in
response to TNF-α by approximately 50%.

CK2 Inhibition Results in Cell Cycle Arrest and
Loss of Viability
As the above data demonstrate, CK2 has multiple
effects on the signaling landscape of human breast cancer
cell lines. We were therefore interested in the functional
consequences of CK2 inhibition on these cell lines in
vitro. First, we performed the WST-1 cell viability assay
using CX-4945 dose- and time-dependently. As shown
in Figure 6A, MDA-MB-231 cells nearly sextupled over
the course of 72 h, while MCF-7 cells grew much more
slowly, not even doubling in the same period (Figure

Figure 6: CX-4945 Causes Cell Cycle Arrest and Loss of Viability. A-B, MDA-MB-231 (A) and MCF-7 (B) cells were plated

at 2,000 and 5,000 cells per well, respectively, and treated with CX-4945 at 2, 5 and 10 μM. The WST-1 assay was performed at 0, 24 and
48 h. The assay was performed in triplicate at each time and concentration: *, p<0.05; **, p<0.005. C-D, MDA-MB-231 (C) and MCF-7
(D) cells were treated for 24 h with CX-4945 at 5, 10 and 20 μM. Cells were then fixed, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and analyzed
by flow cytometry in order to determine cell cycle stage. E-F, MDA-MB-231 (E) and MCF-7 (F) cells were treated for 24 h with CX-4945
at 2, 5 and 10 μM. Lysates were obtained, and immunoblots performed using the indicated antibodies. All experiments were repeated, and
representative data are shown.

CK2 Inhibition Affects Breast Cancer Cell
Morphology and Migratory Capacity

6B). Despite these strong differences in growth rate, CK2
inhibition seemed to strongly inhibit growth, starting at 24
h and persisting through 72 h. Indeed, the more aggressive
MDA-MB-231 line was more sensitive to CX-4945, with
absorbance at 72 h being barely within the detectable
range.
An important issue with the WST-1 assay, however,
is that it only indirectly measures cell growth. It directly
measures metabolic activity, and CK2, in its prodigious
promiscuity, has multiple documented effects on cell
metabolism [26, 42]. We therefore sought to broaden the
measures by which we evaluated CK2 inhibition’s effect
on cancer cells. We performed cell cycle analysis on both
the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 lines using propidium
iodide staining. Figure 6C-D show that for both cell lines,
24 h of CX-4945 causes a dose-dependent increase in
the proportion of cells in G2, with a concurrent decrease
in the percentage of cells in G1. This suggests that CK2
inhibition causes a G2/M arrest, which is in line with our
previous reports in glioblastoma [34].
However, in order to determine whether loss of
CK2 activity causes actual cell death, we treated both
cell lines with CX-4945 and evaluated PARP status by
immunoblotting. As shown in Figures 6E-F, at 24 h,
CX-4945 causes dose-dependent decreases in full-length
PARP, although increases in cleaved PARP were only
observed in the MCF-7 cell line. This finding suggests
these human breast cancer cells undergo cell death in
response to CK2 inhibition, as well as cell cycle arrest.

In addition to its effects on viability, we observed
that treatment with CX-4945 has striking effects on the
morphology of both the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell
lines, which is in keeping with multiple reports of CK2’s
vital role in maintenance of the cytoskeleton [43]. Figure
7A compares control cells from both lines with those
which have been treated for 18 h with 10 μM of CX-4945.
Both cell lines exhibit signs of cytoplasmic retraction and
cell rounding in response to CK2 inhibition.
Finally, considering its major effects on cell
morphology, we were interested in the potential of CK2 to
affect cell migration. To this end, a wound healing assay
was performed on the MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 7B),
which were plated at confluency, scratched with a p200
pipette tip, and allowed to heal for 48 h in 1% serumcontaining medium. At 24 h, higher concentrations of
CX-4945 (5 and 10 μM) were able to significantly inhibit
wound healing, and this difference became much more
striking at 48 h. These results indicate not only that is
CK2 necessary for cell cycle progression, viability and
morphological maintenance but also that it may also
support the invasive potential of breast cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
In this paper, we highlight the pervasive dependency
of malignant breast cancer cells on CK2 activity for
constitutive signaling, cell cycle progression and cell
survival. First, we unveiled widespread aberrations in
CK2 gene dosages. While gains in CK2α and CK2β were

IL6 and IL8. These results support the hypothesis that
CK2 acts by various noncanonical avenues to affect
its target pathways and raises the possibility that CK2
constitutively primes p65 for transcriptional activity in
response to various stimuli. This result is intriguing from a
therapeutic standpoint, as it suggests that NF-κB inhibition
may be achieved through alternative means, a welcome
possibility considering the many difficulties in producing a
clinically viable NF-κB inhibitor [9]. Indeed, there is some
indirect evidence that the clinical response to CX-4945 is
connected to NF-κB signaling. Phase I studies have shown
that patients have high circulating levels of IL-6 and IL-8
prior to treatment with CX-4945 and that treatment with
CX-4945 causes decreases in the circulating levels of
these cytokines [35]. This decrease may be important in
itself, since both of these cytokines have been connected
to late stage disease, stemness and metastasis [6, 48, 49]
as well as the tumor self-seeding phenomenon [50]. That
high NF-κB activity may be the key factor in determining
response to CK2 inhibition is an intriguing hypothesis
worthy of further investigation.
Finally, we demonstrate that CX-4945 treatment
causes, in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, cell cycle
arrest, morphological changes and apoptosis. In addition,
MDA-MB-231 cells have a decrease in migratory capacity
in response to CK2, potentially implicating this kinase in
the metastatic niche. These results collectively support
the concept of CK2 as vital for cancer cell survival and
aggressiveness.
In conclusion, our results have added to the growing
body of literature supporting the potential of CK2 as
a target in a wide variety of cancers, particularly breast
cancer. CK2’s role in supporting numerous signaling
cascades and its importance to various functional
properties of breast cancer cells highlight it as an
important future target.

common, the most common aberration was heterozygous
loss of CK2α’. This result is somewhat puzzling, as
CK2α’ possesses many of the same catalytic properties as
the highly homologous CK2α subunit, while also having
distinct pro-tumorigenic targets and effects [44]. Thus,
determining the pathophysiological role of CSNK2A2 loss
in breast cancer is important, as it may provide further
information on the distinct roles of the two CK2 catalytic
subunits. Following the bioinformatic analyses, both the
triple negative MDA-MB-231 and HR+ MCF-7 lines
were shown to display elevated CK2α and CK2β. The
MDA-MB-231 cells, however, have much higher levels of
CK2α’ and higher CK2 kinase activity than MCF-7 cells.
This finding is interesting principally because it opens the
possibility that triple negative tumors, which are extremely
difficult to treat in comparison with other clinical subtypes
of breast cancer, will be especially sensitive to therapeutic
CK2 inhibition.
Having thus described the CK2 status in human
breast cancers, we examined the signaling consequences
of pharmacological inhibition of CK2. Treatment with CX4945 caused a broad attenuation of various prosurvival
signaling cascades, including STAT3, Akt/mTOR and
NF-κB, the clinical targetings of which have had limited
success. These results strongly support the role of CK2 as
an underlying bolster to cell signaling generally. However,
from a therapeutic standpoint, these results are especially
exciting, as they suggest that CK2 inhibition may be a
means of indirectly inhibiting numerous procancerous
survival pathways by means of a single drug, rather than
the numerous agents which would be necessary to inhibit
each pathway individually.
We further sought to describe CK2’s role in
inducible STAT signaling. We found that CK2 inhibition
prevents full activation of STAT3 in response to several
IL-6 family cytokines and STAT5 in response to EGF.
Additionally, the transcription and translation of the
STAT3 target gene SOCS3 was attenuated by CK2
inhibition, supporting the functional consequences of
STAT3 inhibition. These results have clinical significance,
as STAT3 activation has been associated with late-stage,
metastatic breast cancer [45, 46]. Thus, CK2 inhibition
may be able to functionally replace inhibitors of STAT3,
which have had difficulty reaching the clinic [47].
According to our results, CK2 is also necessary
for the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in breast cancer,
although it is not strictly necessary for the canonical
activation of this same transcription factor. These results
are intriguing, as CK2 has been previously reported as
an enhancer of signaling upstream of NF-κB p65 [28].
However, in MDA-MB-231 cells, CK2 inhibition does not
strongly affect serine 536 phosphorylation, the canonical
marker of NF-κB activation and transcriptional capacity.
Instead, CX-4945 dose-dependently decreases constitutive
serine 529 phosphorylation, which in turn correlates with
decreases in transcription of the NF-κB target genes
