Abstract
HER2-directed therapies, such as trastuzumab and lapatinib, are
important treatments for breast cancer. However, some tumors
do not respond or develop resistance to these agents. We isolated
and characterized multiple lapatinib-resistant, HER2-positive,
estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer clones derived
from lapatinib-sensitive BT474 cells by chronic exposure to
lapatinib. We show overexpression of AXL as a novel mechanism
of acquired resistance to HER2-targeted agents in these models.
GSK1363089 ( foretinib), a multikinase inhibitor of AXL, MET,
and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor currently in
phase II clinical trials, restores lapatinib and trastuzumab
sensitivity in these resistant cells that exhibit increased AXL
expression. Furthermore, small interfering RNA to AXL, estrogen
deprivation, or fulvestrant, an ER antagonist, decreases AXL
expression and restores sensitivity to lapatinib in these cells.
Taken together, these data provide scientific evidence to assess
the expression of AXL in HER2-positive, ER-positive patients
who have progressed on either lapatinib or trastuzumab and to
test the combination of HER2-targeted agents and GSK1363089
in the clinic. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6871–8]

Introduction
HER2 is one of the four members of the ErbB receptor tyrosine
kinase protein family. Overexpression of HER2 in human breast
tumors correlates with aggressive tumor growth and poor clinical
prognosis. Thus, HER2 is an important therapeutic target in breast
cancer, and several drugs that target HER2 are currently in clinical
use. Lapatinib is a selective, potent, small-molecule, dual inhibitor of
HER1 and HER2 that is approved in combination with capecitabine
for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast
cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who have received prior
therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab (1).
Although overexpression of HER2 correlates with sensitivity to
growth inhibition by lapatinib, not all cells that overexpress HER2
respond to lapatinib (2), and resistance to lapatinib develops in
some patients and/or tumors during chronic exposure to the drug.
The factors that confer primary or acquired resistance to lapatinib
are not well characterized. Several hypotheses including PTEN loss

are reported to be associated with trastuzumab resistance in HER2positive breast cancer (3, 4). However, lapatinib inhibits growth of
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells (5, 6) and shows clinical
efficacy in patients who have received prior therapy with an
anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab (1). Moreover, low PTEN
expression or PIK3CA mutations did not preclude response to
lapatinib in primary tumors from women with HER2-overexpressing
locally advanced breast cancer who received 6 weeks of lapatinib
monotherapy before standard neoadjuvant treatment (7). Multiple
mechanisms of resistance have been reported for tyrosine kinase
inhibitors that selectively target HER1, such as gefitinib and
erlotinib. For example, mutation of threonine 790 to methionine
(T790M; ref. 8) and MET amplification (9) confer resistance to
gefitinib and erlotinib. Other studies show that HER3 could remain
phosphorylated and escape inhibition by HER1-targeted agents (10).
AXL is a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase containing a
kinase domain closely related to MET and an extracellular domain
resembling that of neural cell adhesion molecules (11). Overexpression of AXL is associated with poor prognosis and increased
invasiveness of human cancers and has been reported in breast (12,
13), colon (14), esophageal (15), thyroid (16), ovarian (17), gastric
(18), renal (19), glioma (20), and lung (21) cancers. Overexpressing
the cDNA for AXL yielded a tyrosine-phosphorylated 140 kDa
protein with transforming ability (22, 23). The oncogenic potential
of AXL lies within the tyrosine kinase domain, which can be
activated by overexpression independent of ligand binding (24) or
by binding to growth arrest–specific gene 6 (25). Recent studies
report that increased expression of AXL may play a role in
resistance to imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors that
express cKit (26) and in resistance to chemotherapy in AML (27) as
well as in lung (28) and ovarian (29) cancers.
We established lapatinib-resistant clones from BT474 human
breast cancer cells, which are estrogen receptor (ER)–positive,
progesterone receptor (PgR)–positive, HER2-positive, and lapatinibsensitive, and identified increased AXL expression as a novel
mechanism of resistance to lapatinib and trastuzumab. AXL kinase
inhibition by GSK1363089 ( foretinib), a multikinase inhibitor
targeting AXL, MET, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR), restores lapatinib and trastuzumab sensitivity in these
cells. ER deprivation or blockade restores lapatinib sensitivity by
down-regulating AXL in these cells. These data implicate the
development of novel therapeutic approaches for treating HER2positive breast tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. Human breast carcinoma cell line BT474 was
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Lapatinib,
GSK1363089 (Supplementary Fig. S1), GSK690693, and NVP-BEZ-235 were

synthesized by GlaxoSmithKline. Trastuzumab was purchased from
AmerisourceBergen. Stock solutions of all drugs were prepared in DMSO,
except trastuzumab, and stored at 20jC.
Generation of lapatinib-resistant clones from BT474 cells in vitro.
BT474 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of lapatinib from 0.5,
1, 2, 3, and 5 Amol/L. Single-cell cloning was done by serial dilution or
isolation with cloning cylinders and expanded with 10% fetal bovine serum
culture medium containing 0.5 to 1 Amol/L lapatinib. The R5 and J4 clones
were selected from BT474 cells exposed to 1 and 3 Amol/L lapatinib,
respectively. D3 and D25 were cloned from cells exposed to 5 Amol/L
lapatinib. BT474 parental clones B1, B6, and B12 were selected by single-cell
plating and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
Cell growth inhibition assay. Cell growth inhibition was determined via
CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
methylene blue cell viability method (2). Approximately 24 hours after
plating, cells were exposed to compounds with 2- or 3-fold serial dilutions
alone or the combination of two agents at a constant molar-to-molar ratio
of 1:1 or as indicated. Cells were incubated with the compounds in culture
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days. IC50 values were
determined described previously (2).
Colony formation assay. Cells were plated at 10,000 to 50,000 per well
in a 24-well plate in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The
following day, compounds, at the indicated dilutions, were added to the
cells. For estrogen-deprived conditions, medium was removed and replaced
with phenol red–free RPMI 1640 containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum
with the indicated treatment. Cells were fixed and stained with 50% ethanol
containing 0.1% methylene blue.
Cell apoptosis assays: DNA fragmentation and caspase-3/7 activation. Cell apoptosis was measured using Cell Death ELISAPlus kit (Roche)
and Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Protein extraction,
immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation were done as described
previously (2). The antibodies used in immunoprecipitation are phosphotyrosine (Sigma), HER1 and HER2 (LabVision), HER3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), AXL (Cell Signaling), and p85 (Upstate). The primary
antibodies used for immunoblotting are HER1 (LabVision), HER2 (Cell
Signaling), HER3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AXL, phospho-HER2(Y1221/
1222), phospho-AKT(S473), AKT, BAD, phospho-BAD(S112), phosphoBAD(S136), phospho-FoxO1/3a(T24/T32), cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospho-ERK(T202/Y204; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and h-actin (Abcam). The membranes were developed with
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was purified by Trizol
extraction and purification with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated by High-Capacity Reverse
Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) using random primers. Gene
expression was quantified with TaqMan universal master mix using TaqMan
gene expression assays for AXL (Hs00242357_m1), ESR (Hs01046818_m1),
and PgR (Hs00172183_m1) on the ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems).
Data analysis. All experiments were done as at least two independent
assays. Data are summarized as mean F SD. Statistical analysis of the
results was done by Student’s t test for unpaired samples. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
Selection and characterization of lapatinib-resistant,
HER2-positive, ER-positive breast tumor cell lines. BT474
breast cancer cells were chronically exposed to lapatinib (1, 3, or
5 Amol/L) in vitro and cells that developed resistance were
selected. Twenty-one lapatinib-resistant cell clones were established from BT474 cells and characterized, four of which (J4, D3,
D25, and R5) are shown in Fig. 1. Five control lapatinib-sensitive
clones were also derived from BT474 cells cultured in the absence
of lapatinib. Figure 1A shows representative growth curves of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

these cell lines in the presence of variable concentrations of
lapatinib. The IC50 values of lapatinib-resistant cell lines were >3
Amol/L, f50-fold higher than the IC50 of BT474 cells (0.071
Amol/L) or lapatinib-sensitive clones (B1, B6, B12, 0.051, 0.072,
and 0.096 Amol/L, respectively). The lapatinib-resistant cell lines
were also resistant to growth inhibition by HER-targeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, BI-2992 (Supplementary Table S1), and trastuzumab (Supplementary Table S1;
Supplementary Fig. S2), but they remain sensitive to taxol or
HSP90 inhibitors (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; Supplementary Table S1). The lapatinib-resistant cell lines were more
sensitive to NVP-BEZ-235, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, and GSK690693, an
AKT inhibitor, than parental BT474 cells (Supplementary Table S1).
Growth of the lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant cells were
not significantly inhibited by CI-1040, a MEK inhibitor, dasatinib, a
Src/Abl dual inhibitor, and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
inhibitors (aIR3, BMS-695735; Supplementary Table S1).
The gene copy number and the mRNA and protein levels of
HER1, HER2, and HER3 are similar in the lapatinib-resistant cell
lines compared with the parental BT474 and clones (Fig. 1B and
C; Supplementary Table S2). The HER2 kinase domain (exons
18-24), which was sequenced in genomic DNA from BT474 and
BT474-J4 cells, has no mutations. We also confirmed that the
DNA sequences of TP53 (homozygous mutation, 853G>A), PI3KCA
(heterozygous mutation, 333G>C), KRAS (wild-type), and PTEN
(wild-type) are identical in BT474 and BT474-J4 cells (data not
shown).
Effect of lapatinib on phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in
the lapatinib-resistant BT474 cells. The phosphorylation status
of HER family kinases and downstream targets of PI3K/AKT and
ERK signaling was determined for BT474 and BT474-J4 cells
(Fig. 1B and C; Supplementary Table S3). Lapatinib inhibited
tyrosine phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, and HER3 in both
lapatinib-sensitive BT474 cells and lapatinib-resistant BT474-J4
cells but decreased phosphorylation of AKT(S473), BAD(S136),
FoxO1/FoxO3a(T24/T32), and ERK and reduced expression of
cyclin D1 in only BT474 cells, suggesting that an alternative
pathway to HER2 is responsible for activation of AKT in the
resistant cells (Fig. 1B and C; Supplementary Table S3). Lapatinib
decreased phospho-BAD(S112) to a greater extent in BT474 cells
(76%) than in BT474-J4 cells (32%; Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Table S3). HER4 expression was below the limit of detection by
Western blot in both BT474 and BT474-J4 cells. Both BT474 and
BT474-J4 cells were not sensitive to CI-1040 as determined by cell
growth inhibition (Supplementary Table S1), although ERK
phosphorylation was decreased by CI-1040 (Fig. 1C). NVP-BEZ235 and GSK 690693 decreased the phosphorylation of AKT(S473)
and BAD(S112) and the phosphorylation of BAD(S112), respectively, and both compounds reduced the expression of cyclin D1 in
both BT474 and BT474-J4 cells (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S3).
GSK690693 induced phosphorylation of AKT(S473) in BT474
cells, as reported previously (30), and in BT474-J4 cells (Fig. 1C).
This observation is consistent with published reports of other
AKT inhibitors and likely represents a previously hypothesized
feedback pathway (30, 31). In addition, the effects of GSK690693
were analyzed on phospho-BAD(S136) and phospho-FoxO1/FoxO3a(T24/T32) that showed decreased phosphorylation z50% in
both BT474 and BT474-J4 cells (Supplementary Table S3). Control
experiments showed that the differences in the levels of

phosphoproteins noted above are not due to different levels of total
protein (Fig. 1B and C). BT474-J4 cells were more sensitive than
BT474 cells to the PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor
and the AKT inhibitor as measured by cell growth inhibition
(Supplementary Table S1). GSK690693 induced apoptosis significantly in BT474-J4 cells as determined by DNA fragmentation and
caspase-3/7 activation but not in BT474 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Together, these data suggest that lapatinib-resistant cells
have an active PI3K/AKT pathway that is resistant to HER2
inhibition but can still be modulated by PI3K/AKT inhibitors.
Increased expression and activation of AXL in the lapatinibresistant BT474 cells. Analysis by Western blot using a
phosphotyrosine antibody detected a protein band at f140 kDa
of varying intensities in all the 17 lapatinib-resistant clones tested,
which was not detected in BT474 cells and lapatinib-sensitive
parental clones (Fig. 2A; data not shown). Mass spectrometry–
based peptide sequencing identified this protein as AXL (Supplementary Fig. S4). This result was confirmed when the same band
was detected only in the lapatinib-resistant BT474-J4 cells by
Western blot analyses using an AXL-specific antibody (Fig. 2A).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that
high levels of AXL mRNA were expressed in BT474-J4 (C t = 20.7 F
0.2) and additional lapatinib-resistant cell lines when compared

www.aacrjournals.org

with BT474 cells (C t = 34.6 F 1.0). C t values for glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase from BT474-J4 and BT474 cells are
23.6 F 0.2 and 23.5 F 0.2, respectively.
To further characterize the mechanism of increased AXL
expression in lapatinib-resistant BT474-J4 cells, we determined
the gene copy number and analyzed the promoter and coding
regions of AXL. Quantitative PCR showed a slight (f2-fold)
increase in AXL DNA copy number in the BT474-J4 lapatinibresistant cell line when compared to the BT474 cells. Nucleotide
changes were not detected by DNA sequencing within the
promoter area of AXL using the genomic DNA and the coding
region of AXL using cDNA from BT474 and BT474-J4 cells. We
determined the DNA methylation status of the AXL promoter with
bisulfite sequencing. Results indicated several methylation sites
within the screened AXL promoter area for BT474 and lack of these
sites in lapatinib-resistant BT474-J4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
These results suggest that hypomethylation in the promoter region
may play a role in the increased expression of AXL in BT474-J4
lapatinib-resistant cells and are consistent with recent reports that
hypomethylation of the AXL promoter correlates with AXL
overexpression (27, 32).
Inhibition or down-regulation of AXL restores lapatinib
sensitivity. The role of AXL in acquired lapatinib resistance was

tested by treating BT474-J4 and the additional five lapatinib-resistant
clones including D3, D25, and R5 with lapatinib in the presence
and absence of GSK1363089, a potent small-molecule inhibitor
of MET, VEGFR (33), and AXL (IC50 = 11 nmol/L). The mRNA
expression levels of VEGFR were below detection by Affymetrix
array (<50 MAS5 intensity) and the protein expression level of MET
was low in both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant BT474
cells (data not shown) and therefore are likely not relevant.
Lapatinib inhibited phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, and HER3
and decreased AKT and ERK phosphorylation in BT474 cells as
described above (Fig. 1B) and these cells expressed negligible
amounts of AXL as shown in Fig. 2A. Lapatinib also inhibited
phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, and HER3 in BT474-J4 cells,
whereas phosphorylation of AXL, AKT, and ERK was not decreased
on lapatinib treatment of these cells (Figs. 1B and 2A and B). In
contrast to lapatinib, GSK1363089 inhibited phosphorylation of AXL
and decreased phosphorylation of ERK but not the phosphorylation
of HER1, HER2, HER3, and AKT in BT474-J4 cells. However, when
BT474-J4 cells were treated with GSK1363089 plus lapatinib,
phosphorylation levels of HER1, HER2, HER3, and AXL were
inhibited, phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK were decreased,
and expression of cyclin D1 was reduced (Fig. 2B). Similar results
were observed in D25 clone (data not shown). This indicates
inhibition of both HER family receptors and AXL is necessary to
completely block downstream signaling.
To investigate how AXL may sustain PI3K/AKT signaling in these
HER2-positive, lapatinib-resistant cells, we immunoprecipitated
AXL or the p85 subunit of PI3K from extracts of BT474 and BT474J4 cells (Fig. 2A). The immunoprecipitates from BT474-J4 cells
included both AXL and p85, suggesting that these two proteins may
have a functional interaction. Interestingly, the association between
AXL and p85 was disrupted by lapatinib in combination with
GSK1363089 but not by either compound alone (1.0 Amol/L
lapatinib or 0.1 Amol/L GSK1363089; Fig. 2A). In contrast,
treatment of BT474 or BT474-J4 with lapatinib alone inhibited
the association between HER3 and p85. These data suggest that the
interaction of p85 with either HER3 or AXL is sufficient to activate
PI3K/AKT signaling in BT474-J4 cells (Fig. 2B).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

The biological consequences of AXL and HER2 inhibition were also
examined. GSK1363089 restored the sensitivity of cell growth
inhibition by lapatinib in BT474-J4, D3, D25, R5 and two additional
lapatinib-resistant clones determined by CellTiter-Glo, methylene
blue cell viability (Fig. 3A; data not shown), and colony formation
assays (Supplementary Fig. S6A; data not shown). Combining
GSK1363089 with lapatinib increased DNA fragmentation and
caspase-3/7 activation, both hallmarks of apoptosis in BT474-J4 cells
(Fig. 3A). Dose-dependent increases in the percentage of the ‘‘sub-G1’’
population, indicative of apoptotic or dead cells, were also observed
in BT474-J4 cells treated with GSK1363089 in combination with
lapatinib (Supplementary Fig. S6B). GSK1363089 also restored
trastuzumab sensitivity in BT474-J4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
This effect was not modulated by hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand
for MET, providing further evidence that the MET receptor does not
play a role in the response. Because GSK1363089 is a multikinase
inhibitor, two additional compounds were used as controls. Neither
PHA-665752, a MET inhibitor that does not inhibit AXL, nor
pazopanib, a VEGFR, cKit, and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor inhibitor, alone or in combination with lapatinib, significantly inhibited growth of BT474-J4 cells (Supplementary Table S1).
The hypothesis that AXL plays a role in acquired lapatinib
resistance was further tested by down-regulating AXL expression in
BT474-J4 cells using AXL-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA).
We established that AXL-targeted siRNA reduced the level of AXL
mRNA (data not shown) and reduced AXL protein expression by
>90% in BT474-J4 cells (Fig. 3B). Importantly, BT474-J4 cells treated
with AXL siRNA were sensitive to growth inhibition by lapatinib,
whereas cells treated with control siRNA were not (Fig. 3B).
Similarly, BT474-J4 cells were relatively insensitive to treatment
with HER2 siRNA alone compared with parental BT474 cells but
were sensitive to growth inhibition by HER2 siRNA and increasing
concentrations of GSK1363089 (Supplementary Fig. S7). These
results provide evidence that overexpression of AXL confers
lapatinib resistance (Fig. 3B) and trastuzumab resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2) to BT474-J4 and that lapatinib or trastuzumab
sensitivity is restored in these cells by inhibiting expression or
activity of HER2 and AXL.

Overexpression of AXL in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer

Estrogen deprivation and fulvestrant down-regulates AXL
expression and restores lapatinib sensitivity in the lapatinibresistant BT474 cells. We determined the ER and PgR status in
BT474 cells and six lapatinib-resistant cell lines and verified
that BT474 cells are ER-positive and PgR-positive, whereas all
the lapatinib-resistant clones are ER-positive and PgR-negative
(Fig. 4A). In comparison with the parental BT474 cells, the resistant
clones displayed a range of ER expression of 1.6- to 1.8-fold by
Affymetrix analysis (Supplementary Fig. S8), 0.3- to 2.5-fold by
qRT-PCR, and 0.1- to 2.8-fold by Western blot analysis. Therefore,
the effect of estrogen deprivation (a surrogate model for aromatase
inhibition, such as treatment with letrozole), fulvestrant, an ER
antagonist, and tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, on lapatinib sensitivity
of BT474-J4 cells was determined. BT474-J4 cells cultured in
estrogen-depleted medium were sensitive to lapatinib (Fig. 4C and
D). Fulvestrant also restored lapatinib sensitivity to BT474-J4 cells

(Fig. 4B and C), whereas tamoxifen had a much weaker effect (data
not shown). Intriguingly, both estrogen-depleted medium and
fulvestrant down-regulated the expression of AXL mRNA (data not
shown) and protein (Fig. 4D). These effects were reversed by
addition of 17h-estradiol (Fig. 4C and D). AXL down-regulation
by estrogen deprivation or fulvestrant is unexpected and novel,
implicating that lapatinib in combination with ER blockers, such as
fulvestrant, or aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, could be
effective combinations in the clinic.
Genotypic and gene expression changes associated with
acquired lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive, ER-positive
BT474 cells. DNA copy number analysis performed on four
lapatinib-sensitive cell lines and four lapatinib-resistant cell lines
revealed similar HER2 amplification levels; however, several
low-level copy number differences (f3-5 copies) were observed
between lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant cell lines

was measured by CellTiter-Glo. C, colony
formation assay for BT474-J4 cells in the
presence of lapatinib (0.5 Amol/L; Lap ) and

serum (normal growth medium) or in the
presence or absence of 10 nmol/L

charcoal-stripped medium. Cells were
treated for 10 d and then fixed and
stained with methylene blue. D, effect of

of AXL in BT474-J4 cells. Cells were plated
in normal culture medium followed by
treatment with the indicated concentrations
of fulvestrant or the medium was
replaced with estrogen-depleted
medium ( E2 ), estrogen was added
(+E2; 10 nmol/L), or the combination of
17h-estradiol (10 nmol/L) and fulvestrant
(10 nmol/L; E2+Fulvest ) was added
for 72 h.

(Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). For example, 4 of 4 lapatinibresistant cell lines harbor low-level amplification of 19q13.2, which
contains AXL and AKT2, whereas 4 of 4 lapatinib-sensitive cell lines
did not have amplification of this region.
Global gene expression profiling was done to compare differences between lapatinib-sensitive cells (BT474, B1, B6, and B12)
and lapatinib-resistant cells (J4, D3, D25, and R5) using the
Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2 chip. Approximately 250 genes were
differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant clones,
which were statistically significant with P < 0.001 and z2-fold
cutoff (data not shown). Highlights of these data, including 54
representative loci, are displayed graphically in Supplementary
Fig. S8A using Ward’s method of hierarchical clustering. Genes that
were differentially expressed between lapatinib-sensitive and
lapatinib-resistant clones represent those involved in cell signaling
pathways (e.g., AKT2, DUSP6, and PLK2), cell matrix interactions
(e.g., CPE, ETV5, and LGALS3), hormonal regulation (e.g., PgR,
GATA3, and STC2), and epigenetic modification (e.g., HDAC1 and
SMYD2). These data show that the acquisition of lapatinib
resistance in BT474 cells from increased expression of AXL is
associated with significant alterations at the mRNA level.
Gene expression profiles for BT474-J4 lapatinib-resistant cell
lines treated with lapatinib, GSK1363089, and the combination in
comparison with BT474 cells treated with lapatinib alone are
illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S8B. In contrast to either singleagent treatment, BT474-J4 cells treated with lapatinib in combination with GSK1363089 for 24 h strongly down-regulated genes
associated with cell signaling (e.g., DUSP6, DUSP4, PLK2, ICMT, and
RET), cell matrix interactions (e.g., ETV4, ETV5, and FAM46C), cell
growth and survival (e.g., CCND1, CDC25C, and BNIP1), and
metabolism (e.g., CTPS, FABP5, and LRP8) and up-regulated genes
associated with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (e.g., TNFSF10 and
TP53INP1), a profile very similar to parental BT474 cells treated
with lapatinib alone (Supplementary Fig. S8B). These results show

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

that GSK1363089 restores the ability of lapatinib to modulate gene
expression in BT474-J4 cells.

Discussion
The goal of this study was to identify mechanisms by which
HER2-positive, ER-positive human breast cancer cells develop
resistance to lapatinib. For this purpose, lapatinib-resistant clones
were selected from BT474 breast cancer cells in vitro, and 21
independent lapatinib-resistant cell lines were established and
characterized. These cell lines were also resistant to other HERtargeted agents. Our data provide strong evidence that increased
expression of AXL confers a mechanism of acquired resistance to
lapatinib in this model system. This mechanism of lapatinib
resistance has not been identified previously, although lapatinibacquired resistant cell lines have been reported by Xia and
colleagues (34).
AXL is a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, which has
been reported to play a role in resistance to imatinib as well as to
chemotherapy (26–28). This current study provides definitive
evidence that AXL can play a direct role in acquired lapatinib
resistance in HER2-positive, ER-positive breast cancer cells as
follows: (a) BT474 lapatinib-resistant cell lines have increased AXL
expression, whereas BT474 lapatinib-sensitive cell lines do not; (b)
lapatinib sensitivity is restored in BT474 lapatinib-resistant cells by
GSK1363089, a potent inhibitor of AXL, MET, and VEGFR, whereas
compounds inhibiting MET or the VEGFR family do not have this
effect; and (c) AXL-targeted siRNA restores lapatinib sensitivity
in BT474-J4 cells, which are also sensitive to HER2-targeted siRNA
in combination with GSK1363089. These findings provide important information to support the clinical development of combination drug therapies for treating HER2-positive breast cancer and
in the proposed crosstalk among ER, AXL, and HER family
receptors (Fig. 5).

Overexpression of AXL in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer

Phosphorylation of AXL is reported to be associated with HER2
signaling (35). It has also been shown that both AXL and HER3
directly bind p85 for downstream AKT activation (36, 37). Our
data show that neither lapatinib nor GSK1363089 alone interrupts
the interaction between AXL and p85 in BT474-J4 cells, but
lapatinib in combination with GSK1363089 does (Fig. 2A). In
contrast, lapatinib inhibits phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3
and interrupts the interaction between HER3 and p85 in both
BT474 and BT474-J4 cells. This indicates that suppression of both
AXL and HER3 phosphorylation is necessary to block the
interaction of AXL with p85, leading to the disruption of the
PI3K/AKT pathway.
All of the lapatinib-resistant BT474 clones tested express ER but
have lost PgR expression. ER-positive, PgR-negative tumors with
high expression of HER1 or HER2 are more aggressive and are
associated with resistance to single hormonal therapy, such as
tamoxifen in the clinic (38–40). This report shows a novel
mechanism by which HER2-positive, ER-positive breast cancer
cells acquire resistance to lapatinib by increased expression of AXL.
Previous studies suggest that AXL expression correlates with
expression of ER in breast cancer cells (13). We show that estrogen
deprivation (as a surrogate for aromatase inhibitor treatment
such as letrozole) or the ER antagonist fulvestrant reduced AXL
expression and inhibited cell growth in combination with lapatinib.

Estrogen supplementation in the culture medium restored the
overexpression of AXL and lapatinib resistance in BT474-J4 cells
(Fig. 4C and D). These data suggest that lapatinib in combination
with ER blockers such as letrozole or fulvestrant could potentially
treat and/or delay the onset of lapatinib resistance in HER2positive and hormone-positive breast cancer. To test this
hypothesis, the ideal scenario would be to measure the expression
of AXL in pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies of patients
treated with lapatinib who have progressed; however, this is very
difficult to do as access to these samples is limited. The beneficial
effect of lapatinib in combination with estrogen depletion has been
observed in the recently reported EGF30008 clinical trial showing
that lapatinib significantly improved the efficacy of an aromatase
inhibitor letrozole in patients with known HER2-positive, hormone
receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer when compared with
letrozole alone (41). Although this study was first-line treatment of
letrozole F lapatinib, f50% of patients on the study had received
prior endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting. Of the patients who
received prior endocrine therapy, the overwhelming majority had
tamoxifen.
Furthermore, GSK1363089, a multikinase inhibitor that targets
AXL, restores lapatinib sensitivity in HER2-positive breast cancer
cells that overexpress AXL. GSK1363089 is currently in phase II
clinical trials for gastric, head and neck, and papillary renal

Figure 5. Model for ER/AXL-dependent lapatinib
resistance and the crosstalk among ER, AXL, and HER
family receptors in ER-positive and HER2-positive breast
cancer cells. Coactivation of AXL with HER2 leads to
downstream PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling which are
essential to cell growth and survival. ER blockers such as
estrogen deprivation or fulvestrant reduce the expression
of AXL. Inhibiting both HER2 and AXL is necessary to
reduce the downstream PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling and
cell growth.
