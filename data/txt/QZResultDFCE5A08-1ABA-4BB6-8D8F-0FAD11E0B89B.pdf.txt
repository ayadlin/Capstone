BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system are 2 major protein degradation pathways in eukaryotic cells, which are tightly linked to cancer. Proteasome inhibitors have been approved in clinical use against hematologic malignancies, but their application in solid tumors is uncertain. Moreover, the role of autophagy after proteasome inhibition is controversial.
METHODS: Two proteasome inhibitors, 2 autophagy inhibitors, and 3 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines were investigated in
the current study. In vitro, cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay, cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis of annexin-V/propidium iodide staining, and autophagy was evaluated
by green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) redistribution and LC3 Western blot analysis. In vivo, Ki-67 staining was used to
detect cell proliferation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to detect apoptosis, and electron microscopy and p62 immunohistochemical staining were used to detect autophagy.
RESULTS: Proteasome inhibitors suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and activated autophagy in HCC cell lines in vitro, and
autophagy exerted a protective role after proteasome inhibition. In vivo, anticancer effects of bortezomib on the MHCC-97H
orthotopic model (human HCC cells) were different from the effects observed on the Huh-7 subcutaneous model (human HCC cells).
The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine interacted synergistically with bortezomib to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in
both tumor models. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that simultaneous targeting of the proteasome and autophagy

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer and the third most common cause of death from cancer
worldwide.1 Surgical resection, liver transplantation, and ablative therapies can be used as curative treatments for early
stage disease, but pharmacotherapy is considered to be the final and main treatment option for patients with advanced
HCC. Unfortunately, the therapeutic response to traditional chemotherapy is poor; thus, the identification of novel
agents and therapeutic strategies is of the utmost importance for patients with advanced HCC.
Increased protein synthesis and degradation, both of which are required for aggressive tumor growth, are hallmarks
of cancer.2 There are 2 major intracellular pathways of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells: the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome system (autophagy). UPS-mediated proteolysis consists of 2 steps: ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation,3 which affect cell-cycle regulation proteins, tumor suppressors, oncogenes,
transcription factors, and proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. Thus, specific chemical inhibitors of the proteasome
have emerged as effective antitumor drugs.4 The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is now approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and is in clinical use for the treatment of refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Several studies have identified a link between abnormal UPS activity and HCC progression. Plasma proteasome
levels are considered be a reliable marker of malignant transformation of cirrhosis,5 whereas the ubiquitin ligase subunits
SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) and CKS1 (C-terminal Src kinase 1) are associated with the prognosis of
HCC,6 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C gene is overexpressed in HCC.7 On the basis of these findings, we
hypothesized that proteasome inhibitors may be attractive agents for the treatment of HCC.

Proteasome/Autophagy Inhibitors in HCC/Hui et al

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved, intracellular self-defense mechanism characterized by the formation of double-membraned autophagic vesicles, in which
long-lived, aggregated, misfolded proteins and damaged
organelles are sequestered and subsequently degraded
through fusion with lysosomes. Autophagy generally
functions to maintain cellular homeostasis through nutrition recycling and protein quality control.8 Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy may be activated during
chemotherapies.9 Recent studies on the role of autophagy
have highlighted advances in the pharmacologic manipulation of autophagy pathways as a therapeutic strategy for
cancer.10,11 However, whether such autophagy contributes to tumor cell death or is a mechanism of resistance
remains uncertain and may vary, depending on stimulus
type, nutrient availability, organism development, and
apoptotic status.12
In this study, we evaluated the proapoptotic and
antiproliferative effects of 2 proteasome inhibitors, carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG-132) and bortezomib, on
3 HCC cell lines. Furthermore, we investigated the abilities of these proteasome inhibitors to induce autophagy
and the effect of autophagy on HCC cell destiny.

Autophagy Analysis

Autophagy was assessed using green fluorescent proteinlight chain 3 (GFP-LC3) redistribution and LC3 mobility
shift. Redistribution of GFP-LC3 was detected using a
laser confocal microscope. The number of GFP-LC3–
positive dots per cell was determined in 3 independent
experiments. Five randomly selected fields representing
20 cells were counted. For the LC3 mobility shift assay,
cells were lysed with M-PER (Pierce Chemical Company,
Rockford, Ill) and then subjected to immunoblot analysis
with an antibody against LC3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, Mass).
Gene Knockdown by RNA Interference

Autophagy-related 5 homolog (Atg5) RNA interference
was accomplished by transfecting MHCC-97H (human
HCC cells), PLC/PRF/5 (a hepatoma cell line), and Huh7 cells (a human HCC cell line) with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. Primers for the Atg5 targeting sense and the negative control sense were
purchased from GenePharma Company (Shanghai,
China). SiRNAs were transfected using the Lipofectamine
2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Western Blot Analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs

MG-132, chloroquine (CQ), carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanylaspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk)
(a cell-permeant pan caspase inhibitor), and 3 methyladenine (3-MA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, Mo); bortezomib was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, Mass). MG-132, Z-VAD-fmk, and
bortezomib were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide
and diluted with Dulbecco modified eagle medium to the
desired concentration with a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 0.1% for the in vitro studies. CQ and 3-MA
were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and diluted
with Dulbecco modified eagle medium to the desired
concentration.
Apoptosis Analysis

Apoptotic cells were evaluated in vitro by annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide
using Annexin-V/FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD
Pharmingen, San Jose, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stained cells were then analyzed with a
FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the
data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.,
Ashland, Ore).

Briefly, the proteins from total cell lysates were separated
by standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Billerica,
Mass). The membranes were washed, blocked, and incubated with the primary antibody anti-Atg5, anti-Beclin-1,
or anti-LC3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) in a 1:1000
dilution for 16 hours at 4 C followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
The reactions were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence assay.
Orthotopic/Subcutaneous Tumor Model

Briefly, 5  106 cells were injected subcutaneously into
the upper left flank region of nude mice. When the tumor
reached 10 mm in length, it was minced into small pieces
of equal volume (2  22 mm3). MHCC-97H tumor
tissues were transplanted into the livers of 24 nude mice,
and Huh-7 tissues were transplanted subcutaneously into
another 24 mice. Three days later, the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and received the following
treatments through intraperitoneal injection (n ¼ 6 in
each group): 1) control group, saline 4 times weekly; 2)
CQ group, 60 mg/kg 4 times weekly; 3) bortezomib
group, 0.3 mg/kg twice weekly; and 4) combined group,
CQ and bortezomib combination. The mice were killed

for the largest diameter (a) and the smallest diameter (b)
and were calculated as follows: V ¼ a  b2/2. Immunoreactivity was analyzed using Ki-67 and p62 (Abcam, Boston, Mass) for tumor tissue. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using an In
Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, Md)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis

All data are reported as means  standard deviations.
Comparisons of quantitative data were analyzed using
Student t tests between 2 groups or by 1-way analyses of
variance for multiple groups. Differences were considered
significant if the P value was < .05. All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 16.0;
SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Proteasome Inhibitors Suppress Proliferation
and Induce Apoptosis in Hepatocellular
Carcinoma Cell Lines

A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay demonstrated that both MG132 and bortezomib reduced cell viability in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
1A). MHCC-97H cells had partial resistance to proteasome inhibitors with the most gradual dose-response
curves, and treatment with 5 lM MG-132 or 500 nM
bortezomib for 60 hours resulted in approximately
30% to 40% growth inhibition. PLC/PRF/5 cells were
moderately reactive to proteasome inhibitors, and treatment with 2 lM MG-132 or 200 nM bortezomib for
48 hours led to 50% growth inhibition. Huh-7 cells
were the most sensitive of the 3 tested cell types, and
the dose-response curves revealed similar growth inhibition patterns at 36 hours and 60 hours. Treatment
with 4 lM MG-132 and 200 nM bortezomib for 36
hours resulted in almost 50% growth inhibition. On
the basis of these results, the following conditions were
used in subsequent in vitro experiments: 5 lM MG132 or 500 nM bortezomib for 60 hours in MHCC97H cells, 2 lM MG-132 or 200 nM bortezomib for
48 hours in PLC/PRF/5 cells, and 4 lM MG-132 or
200 nM bortezomib for 36 hours in Huh-7 cells.
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the percentage of annexin-V-positive cells increased significantly
in MG-132-treated and bortezomib-treated cells compared
with control cells (Fig. 1B). The apoptotic indices (percentage of annexin-V-positive population) in MHCC-97H
5562

cells were 33%  4% and 34%  2% after MG-132
and bortezomib treatment, respectively (Fig. 1C). The
corresponding apoptotic indices were 45%  13% and
43%  9%, respectively, for PLC/PRF/5 cells and 44%
 11% and 46%  10%, respectively, for Huh-7 cells.
The apoptotic index decreased significantly in all 3
HCC cell lines after cotreatment with the universal
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (50 lM), suggesting that
the induction of apoptosis was at least partially caspase
dependent.
Proteasome Inhibitors Activate Autophagy in
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Lines

First, we first examined dynamic changes in Beclin-1
and LC3 after proteasome inhibition. Levels of both
Beclin-1 and LC3-II proteins increased significantly
after treatment of the cells with proteasome inhibitors
at the specific concentrations mentioned above for
0 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours, and
the increases were especially evident at 6 hours and
12 hours (Fig. 2A).
Second, 3 HCC cell lines with stable GFP-LC3
expression were established and analyzed using confocal
microscopy. The control group for each cell line demonstrated mostly diffuse cytoplasmic staining of GFP-LC3
with very few punctae. Small GFP-LC3–positive dots
were apparent in the perinuclear region in all 3 cell lines
after treatment with either proteasome inhibitor for
12 hours (Fig. 2B). In addition, GFP-LC3 signals revealed
a transition from a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to a punctated membrane pattern, suggesting the localization of
LC3 to autophagosomes. Coincubation with the lysosomal protease inhibitor CQ, which blocks the final steps of
autophagic degradation, resulted in a marked increase in
the number and size of autolysosomes with a much
stronger accumulation of GFP-LC3 dots. In contrast,
3-MA, which inhibits autophagosome formation, significantly decreased the number and size of visible dots in the
treated cells and redistributed GFP-LC3 to the cytoplasm
(Fig. 2C).
Autophagy Inhibition Enhances Proteasome
Inhibitor-Induced Apoptosis in Hepatocellular
Carcinoma Cell Lines

The role of proteasome inhibitor-induced autophagy in cell
survival or cell death in HCC cells was examined by blocking autophagy with 3-MA or CQ in cells that were exposed
to proteasome inhibitors. The combination of either proteasome inhibitor with CQ or 3-MA markedly increased
the percentage of annexin-V-positive cells compared with

The effects of autophagy on apoptosis were investigated further using genetic modification with Atg5-specific siRNA and negative control siRNA. Western blot
analyses indicated that Atg5 expression in HCC cells was
silenced successfully compared with the negative control

knockdown by siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in
the induction of autophagosomes by proteasome inhibitors detected by GFP-LC3 analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, Atg5 siRNA-transfected cells had significantly

was almost 50% less than that in the bortezomib group
(P < .05) (Fig. 5A). Although single-agent bortezomib
produced no obvious antitumor activity in the Huh-7
subcutaneous model, the mean tumor volume when bortezomib was combined with CQ was only 421  100
mm3 (P < .05) (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, treatment with
CQ alone had no effect on tumor growth in either tumor
model.
Bortezomib Interacts Synergistically With
Chloroquine to Suppress Proliferation and
Induce Apoptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
In Vivo

TUNEL staining demonstrated that bortezomib alone
resulted in a moderate increase in apoptosis, with apoptotic indexes of 5.1%  0.4% in the MHCC-97H orthotopic model and 3.9  0.5% in the Huh-7 subcutaneous
model (Fig. 6A,B). Therefore, the proapoptotic effect of
bortezomib was greater in the MHCC-97H model than
in the Huh-7 model. Similarly, Ki-67 staining also indicated a significant reduction in proliferative activity in
the bortezomib-treated MHCC-97H orthotopic model
compared with the control group (40.5%  4% vs
62.6%  1.7%; P < .05), but not in the Huh-7 subcutaneous model (76.5%  9.7% vs 83.6%  3.3%; P ¼ .59).
Although CQ alone produced no obvious proapoptotic or antiproliferative effects in vivo, the combination
of bortezomib with CQ increased proapoptotic activity.
The apoptotic index in the MHCC-97H orthotopic
model increased from 5.1%  0.4% to 8.2%  1% (P <
.05), whereas the apoptotic index in the Huh-7 subcutaneous model increased from 3.9%  0.5% to 11.3% 
3.1% (P < .05). Combination therapy also increased the
proliferative inhibition: The proliferation index in
MHCC-97H tumors decreased from 40.5%  4% (bortezomib) to 20.3%  0.7% (combination; P < .05),
whereas the proliferative index in Huh-7 tumors
decreased from 76.5  9.7% to 36.8  9.6% (P < .05).
To determine whether bortezomib could effectively
activate and whether CQ could block autophagy in vivo,
we investigated the effects of these drugs on the expression
of p62 (Fig. 6A,B), which accumulates during defective
autophagy. Expression levels of p62 were decreased to
0.66 in MHCC-97H tumors and to 0.81 in Huh-7
tumors after bortezomib treatment, suggesting autophagy
influx in vivo. However, the combination of bortezomib
with CQ caused p62 expression levels to increase to 1.37
(MHCC-97H) and 1.27 (Huh-7), demonstrating that
the decrease in p62 accumulation by autophagy activation
after bortezomib treatment could be blocked by CQ.

Transmission electron microscopy further indicated the dramatic accumulation of autophagic vesicles
that contained electron-dense, undigested materials in
the CQ group, suggesting a role for CQ in the degradation of autophagosomes/lysosome fusion blockage
(Fig. 6C). The formation of multiple autophagosomes
in cells in the bortezomib-treated group indicated the
induction of autophagy, whereas the presence of
masses of condensed chromatin and apoptotic bodies
indicated an increase of apoptosis in the combination
group.
DISCUSSION
Apoptosis resistance is a major obstacle to successful
chemotherapy in patients with advanced HCC and is correlated with the metastatic potential of tumor cells.13
Conquering this issue, thus, is a key goal in HCC treatment. Metabolic disorders recently have become a recognized feature of cancer; therefore, targeting protein
degradation pathways may represent a new therapeutic
strategy.14 We examined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on HCC by observing the role of inhibition of UPS
and the interlinked autophagy system on HCC apoptosis
and proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo.
Consistent with most other in vitro studies,15,16
proteasome inhibitors demonstrated antiproliferative
and proapoptotic effects in all 3 tested HCC cell lines,
and proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction
were inversely proportional to the different metastatic
potentials of the cells (MHCC-97H>PLC/PRF/
5>Huh-7). In vivo, the apoptotic index of bortezomib
in an MHCC-97H orthotopic model was 5%, whereas
the proliferation index decreased by 20%, resulting in a
reduction in mean tumor volume of 20%. This suggests
that proteasome inhibitors (such as bortezomib), which
have been approved by the FDA for hematologic malignancies, also may play a potential therapeutic role in
solid tumors.
We were surprised to observe that the apoptotic
index of bortezomib in the Huh-7 subcutaneous model
was only 3.9%, and no obvious antiproliferative effects or
tumor regression were observed. Excluding other possible
mechanisms of molecular resistance,17,18 we assume that
the contrasting results for the MHCC-97H and Huh-7
models in vitro and in vivo may be attributable to the different tumor model types. Previous research on the association between bortezomib efficacy and tumor architecture,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics demonstrated
that a lack of broad bortezomib activity in solid tumors
was associated with insufficient tumor perfusion.19 It was
5569

Original Article

reported that injection of bortezomib directly into human
tumors implanted into mice resulted in a 70% reduction
in the volume of the tumors in 40% of samples.20 Therefore, the definite anticancer effects of proteasome inhibitors on the 3 HCC cell lines in vitro may be caused by
perfect drug exposure, like the experience in hematologic
malignancies. However, in the in vivo models, the orthotopic tumor (MHCC-97H) had a double blood supply
from the hepatic artery and the portal vein, suggesting that
bortezomib exposure and local concentrations may have
been much higher than in the subcutaneous Huh-7 model
after intraperitoneal injection.
It was believed initially that UPS and autophagy
were independent systems associated with different degradation mechanisms, substrates, and signaling pathways
and with different physiologic characteristics. However,
recent evidence suggests that they comprise 2 complementary and interlinked protein degradation pathways. Ubiquitinated proteins can be degraded by selective autophagy
through p62 docking protein,21 and the autophagic protein LC3 can be processed by the 20S proteasome.22 In
addition, proteasome inhibitors induce misfolded proteins and protein aggregates to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to endoplasmic reticulum
stress,23 which, in turn, activates autophagy, resulting in
the removal of potentially toxic, damaged proteins.24 In
the current study, 2 key autophagy genes (Beclin-1 and
LC3) were up-regulated by proteasome inhibitors in a
time-dependent manner from 0 hours to 24 hours in the
HCC cell lines. In addition, confocal microscopy provided visible evidence that GFP-LC3 punctae were
increased significantly in all 3 cell lines after proteasome
inhibitor treatment, indicating the activation of autophagy
after proteasome inhibition. Autophagy detection in vivo
has been a challenging problem for many years. However,
studies have indicated that p62, also called sequestosome
1, binds directly to a central component of the autophagy
machinery of LC3; thus, p62 accumulates in mouse models of defective autophagy.25 Therefore, we evaluated p62
staining in histologic sections and observed that bortezomib alone reduced p62 levels in both MHCC-97H and
Huh-7 tumor models. Furthermore, p62 expression
increased significantly after combined treatment with bortezomib and the autophagy inhibitor CQ. These results
were consistent with the electron microscopic findings,
suggesting that immunohistochemical staining for p62
may be a reliable marker of autophagy in vivo.
Although cell death resulting from progressive cellular consumption has been attributed to unrestrained
autophagy, leading to the belief that autophagy is a nona5570

poptotic form of programmed cell death, most evidence
supports autophagy as a survival pathway required for cellular viability.26 Treatment with both 3-MA and CQ, as
well as siRNA knockdown of the essential autophagy gene
Atg5, all potentiated proteasome inhibitor-induced cell
death in vitro. Combined treatment with bortezomib and
CQ resulted in a marked increase in the number of
TUNEL-positive tumor cells compared with tumors that
were treated with bortezomib alone. These findings indicate that autophagy activation in HCC directly contributes to the survival of cancer cells treated with proteasome
inhibitors.
Targeting the protein metabolism system is revealing increased validity and multiplicity as a promising cancer therapy strategy. Disruption of the UPS by
bortezomib has been introduced for the clinical treatment
of hematologic malignancies, and bortezomib as an adjuvant combined with other chemotherapeutic agents also
has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in some solid
tumors.27 However, to date, single proteasome inhibitor
agents have proven unsatisfactory for solid tumors in clinical trials.28 The results of the current study suggest that
efficient tumor perfusion, drug exposure, and autophagy
inhibition can enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors on HCC. The FDA-approved antimalarial agent CQ
has been used safely for several decades for malaria prophylaxis and may be useful in combination with proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of HCC. Furthermore,
locoregional therapy, such as hepatic arterial infusion,
may improve drug exposure.
To our knowledge, the drug dose in combined therapy with bortezomib and CQ for HCC has not been
reported previously. In clinical studies, patients with myeloma who received bortezomib alone at a dose of 1.3
mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed by a 10-day rest
period. However, recently, Takeda Oncology and the
FDA suggested these patients with moderate or severe
hepatic impairment should receive bortezomib at
reduced starting doses and should be monitored closely
for toxicities, because bortezomib is metabolized by liver
enzymes and its exposure is increased in these patients.
HCC is always concomitant with cirrhosis and/or hepatitis B or C virus infection, which is compromised in liver
function. Moreover, we also expected that combined
therapy would further reduce drug dose and improve efficacy. Consequently, the decreased dose of bortezomib
(0.3 mg/kg [0.9 mg/m2] twice weekly), which is widely
adopted in in vivo research, was used in our study.
In conclusion, this study offers a novel strategy for
enhancing cancer control in HCC through integration of

of the proteasome and autophagy pathways may represent
