Abstract
Estrogen independence and progression to a metastatic phenotype are hallmarks of therapeutic resistance
and mortality in breast cancer patients. Metastasis has been associated with chemokine signaling through the
SDF-1–CXCR4 axis. Thus, the development of estrogen independence and endocrine therapy resistance in breast
cancer patients may be driven by SDF-1–CXCR4 signaling. Here we report that CXCR4 overexpression is indeed
correlated with worse prognosis and decreased patient survival irrespective of the status of the estrogen receptor
(ER). Constitutive activation of CXCR4 in poorly metastatic MCF-7 cells led to enhanced tumor growth and
metastases that could be reversed by CXCR4 inhibition. CXCR4 overexpression in MCF-7 cells promoted
estrogen independence in vivo, whereas exogenous SDF-1 treatment negated the inhibitory effects of treatment
with the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 on CXCR4-mediated tumor growth. The effects of CXCR4 overexpression were
correlated with SDF-1–mediated activation of downstream signaling via ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (mitogen
activated protein kinase) and with an enhancement of ER-mediated gene expression. Together, these results
show that enhanced CXCR4 signaling is sufficient to drive ER-positive breast cancers to a metastatic and
endocrine therapy-resistant phenotype via increased MAPK signaling. Our findings highlight CXCR4 signaling as
a rational therapeutic target for the treatment of ER-positive, estrogen-independent breast carcinomas needing
improved clinical management. Cancer Res; 71(2); 603–13. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Although endocrine therapy holds great promise in the
treatment of hormone-dependent cancer, many patients with
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinoma exhibit de
novo resistance to these therapies or will acquire resistance
over the course of the disease. Resistance, whether de novo or
acquired, primarily occurs through altered cellular signaling
cascades leading to ligand-independent activation of ERmediated gene expression and ultimately a hormone-independent phenotype (1). The progression to hormone independence
and endocrine therapy resistance is a hallmark sign of progressive carcinoma (2, 3). At this time, all endocrine treatments
currently approved for clinical use ultimately result in resistance, showing the ability of carcinoma cells to adapt by altering
cellular signaling (4–6). Understanding the path to resistance is
critical to developing better treatment options in the future.
The stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1)–CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis is a known mediator of metastasis in breast
cancer as first shown by Muller and colleagues (7). Subsequent
studies of clinical breast carcinoma tissues revealed CXCR4
expression in both primary invasive and in situ ductal carcinomas, suggesting a role for the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis at all

stages of the disease (8). A link between hormone and chemokine signaling in breast carcinoma cells has been proposed,
but not shown, based upon the association of a metastatic
phenotype with a hormone-independent phenotype (2, 9).
SDF-1 is also an ERa-regulated gene, suggesting involvement
of the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis on ER-mediated signaling (10).
Furthermore, the biological effects of the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis
are mediated through G-protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)
signaling leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways including mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
family members and PI3K-AKT cascades (11, 12), which have
been implicated in development of resistance to endocrine
therapy in breast carcinoma (13, 14).
Though it is clear that the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis is a key player
in breast cancer, particularly in regard to metastatic disease, its
role in primary tumorigenesis and the progression to a hormone-independent phenotype has yet to be determined. The
purpose of this study was to determine the effects of CXCR4
expression, wild-type (WT) and constitutively active (DCTD),
on the primary and metastatic tumorigenicity of the ERpositive hormone-dependent breast carcinoma cells. Further,
the mechanisms of the hormone-independent and endocrine
therapy-resistant attributes contributed by CXCR4 expression
on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-361 cells were also examined.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples staining and analysis
The results of immunostaining for CXCR4 and ERa were
examined using an immunohistochemical (IHC) histologic
score (H-score) incorporating intensity and distribution of
staining. The H-score is described by: HS ¼ (p*i)/100, where
p denotes the percentage of stained cells and i denotes the
intensity of the staining (15). The H-score scale was 0–3.
Staining scale: 0, none; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong.
Scoring was performed blinded by trained pathologists (16).
Cells and reagents
MCF-7N cell variant (subclone of MCF-7 human breast
adenocarcinoma line from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) was generously provided by Louise Nutter (University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) in 1996 (17). The MDA-MB361 cell line (ER-positive human breast cancer cell line)
acquired from ATCC in 2004. Liquid nitrogen stocks were
made upon receipt and maintained until the start of each
study. Estrogen response element–luciferase and/or qPCR for
ER and progesterone receptor (PgR) were used to confirm cell
lines sustained estrogen responsiveness. Morphology and
doubling times were also recorded regularly to ensure maintenance of phenotype. Cells were used for no more than
6 months after being thawed. Cells were cultured as previously
described (18, 19). AMD-3100 was purchased from SigmaAldrich, PD184352 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and RWJ67657 and ICI 182,780 from Tocris Bioscience.
Generation of stable cell lines
Generation of MCF-7 stable cell lines with truncated CXCR4
(DCTD), wild-type CXCR4 (WT), or the vector was carried out

as previously described (20). A series of stable cell clones were
independently derived for confirmation of phenotypes.
Each expression vector contained eGFP sequence for cell
identification.
Western blot
Western blot analyses were conducted as published (21).
After 72hrs in 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CSFBS) DMEM phenol-free medium, cells were refed with
medium-containing vehicle, SDF-1 (10 ng/mL), ICI (100
nmol/L), or SDF-1 þ ICI. Membranes were probed with
primary antibodies according to manufacturer's protocol.
Antibodies: total ERa, CXCR4, corresponding total protein
antibodies, a-tubulin (Millipore). Primary antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling unless noted. IR-tagged secondary antibodies were purchased from LiCor Biosciences.
Blots were analyzed by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LiCor Biosciences). Experiments were conducted in
triplicate.
Animal studies
Xenograft tumor studies were conducted as described (18,
19, 22). Detailed methods are available in Supplementary
Materials and Methods section. For all groups, n ¼ 5. All
procedures involving animals were conducted in compliance
with state and federal laws, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, and guidelines established by the
Tulane and Vanderbilt Universities Animal Care and Use
Committees. The facilities and laboratory animal programs
of the Universities are accredited by the Association for
the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care.
Flow cytometry
Excised lungs were minced and pressed through 70-mm
nylon cell strainer (VWR) with 2 mL of HBSS. Single-cell
suspension was collected by centrifugation and washed twice.
RBCs were lysed with ACK Lysing Buffer (0.15 mol/L NH4Cl; 1
mol/L KHCO3; 0.1 mmol/L Na2EDTA, pH 7.2) followed by 2
washes. Pooled blood was separated on Ficoll-hypaque to
obtain the cellular component and eliminate RBCs. Remaining
RBCs were lysed with ACK. Cells labeled with CellTracker
Violet (CTV) BMQC Dye (Invitrogen) in HBSS (5 mmol/L per
sample). Cells were incubated in CTV (15 minutes) at 37 C
with rocking, washed, resuspended in 10% DMEM, incubated
on a rocker (15 minutes). Cells were washed with HBSS before
addition of 250 mL of HBSS with 7-aminoactinomycin D
(Invitrogen; 1 mg/mL in PBS). Cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry for GFP. Control tissues were taken from uninjected mice were processed at same time as experimental
animal tissue.
Immunohistochemistry
Slides from FFPE lungs were deparaffinized and processed
for antigen retrieval by heating in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate
buffer (pH 6). Endogenous H2O2 quenched with 1% H2O2
in water. Slides were blocked with normal horse serum

CXCR4 expression effects on breast carcinoma patient
survival
To verify a role for CXCR4 expression in patients, IHC
staining of CXCR4 and ERa was conducted to determine
expression in clinical primary breast tumor samples
(Fig. 1A). Of the total 201 cases studied, 76 (37.8%) were
positive for CXCR4, whereas 108 (53.7%) were ER positive.
No significant correlation between ER status and CXCR4
expression was observed, suggesting that each represents
an independent marker (Table 1).
The Kaplan–Meier analysis of patient survival was determined for CXCR4(þ) and CXCR4() breast carcinomas based
on ER status (Fig. 1B). As expected, ER(þ) staining alone was a

correlation between poor patient survival among ER() and
CXCR4(þ) tumors was identified, suggesting that overexpression of CXCR4 is associated with decreased survival in breast
carcinoma patients regardless of ER status. These results are
consistent with previously published findings by Li and
colleagues in which high CXCR4 expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival of breast cancer
patients (25).
Effects of constitutively active CXCR4 signaling on
breast carcinoma growth in vivo
The carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of chemokine receptors play a crucial regulatory role associated with receptor
desensitization and downregulation. Mutation of key regions
of the CTD of CXCR4 results in constitutive activation.
Previously, we had shown increased in vitro proliferation
of MCF-7 cells expressing the truncated form of CXCR4
(MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD cells) compared with MCF-7CXCR4-WT and MCF-7-vector expressing cells (20). Orthotopic mouse mammary tumor models were used to assess
the role of constitutively active CXCR4 on primary tumorigenesis and metastasis. MCF-7 cells stably expressing empty
vector, CXCR4-WT, or CXCR4-DCTD were injected into the
cleared mammary fat pad of female athymic nude mice and
primary tumor growth examined. Mice injected with MCF-7CXCR4-DCTD cells displayed palpable tumors 2 weeks after
injection. Moreover, when orthotopic injections were conducted by mixing cells in a Matrigel solution, there was
reduced tumor formation variability (19, 26). MCF-7-CXCR4DCTD tumor growth was significantly enhanced compared
with MCF-7-CXCR4-WT (P < 0.01), supporting previous in
vitro findings that deletion of the CTD of CXCR4 enhances
MCF-7 cell proliferation (20).
CXCR4 expressing breast carcinoma cells exhibit
enhanced metastasis
Though MCF-7 cells are minimally invasive (27, 28), our
previous in vitro data (20) indicated that expression of
CXCR4-DCTD resulted in increased motility and a gene
expression profile consistent with a metastatic phenotype.
To examine the effects of CXCR4 expression on the spontaneous metastases in vivo, GFP-labeled MCF-7-vector, MCF7-CXCR4-WT, or MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD cells were injected
orthotopically into immunocompromised mice. GFP-IHC
staining of tissue sections revealed micrometastases in
the lungs of MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD injected mice (Fig. 2B).
FACS analysis of GFP(þ) cells revealed increases in MCF-7GFP cells in the lungs of MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD injected mice
(0.704%  0.4% viable GFPþ cells) compared with vector
(0.05%  0.03%) or CXCR4-WT (0.125%  0.07%) injected
mice (Fig. 2C).
To account for variable metastatic seeding due to tumor
size, the direct tail vein model was used to determine the
metastatic capacity of GFP-expressing MCF-7 lines (vector,
WT-CXCR4 or CXCR4-DCTD). After 3 weeks, blood, lungs,
bone marrow, and liver were harvested for analysis. Metastatic
lesions were only visible in the lungs. Minimal metastases
were observed on lung surfaces of MCF-7-WT-CXCR4 or

606

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

MCF-7-vector-injected mice; however, numerous surface
metastases were grossly visible in MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD
injected mice (Fig. 2D; P < 0.01). Animals injected with
parental MCF-7 cells showed no visible metastases. FACS
analysis revealed abundant viable GFP(þ) cells in the lungs
of MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD injected mice (0.53%  0.15%). Animals injected with vector (0.01%  0.005%) or MCF-7-CXCR4WT cells (0.002%  0.002%) exhibited minimal GFP(þ) cells
(Fig. 2E; P < 0.01). RT-PCR analysis of liver samples from MCF7-CXCR4-DCTD and MCF-7-CXCR4-WT injected animals
revealed increased GFP expression compared with vector
(Supplementary Fig. 1) indicating CXCR4-mediated–enhanced
metastasis. There was no evidence of GFP(þ) cells in bone
marrow or blood (data not shown).
Effects of CXCR4 expression on epithelial cell markers
Cultured MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD cells exhibit epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes: stellate
appearance, enhanced motility, and decreased cell adhesion
protein expression (E-cadherin, ZO-1; ref. 20). To determine
if this phenotype was retained in vivo, primary tumor sections were examined. The localization and expression of Ecadherin, was evaluated by comparing the staining pattern
of E-cadherin (green) and b-catenin (red) in primary tumor
sections by immunofluorescent microscopy. Both MCF-7CXCR4-WT and vector control tumors showed high levels of
membrane and cell junction expression of b-catenin and Ecadherin. Overlays show b-catenin and E-cadherin colocalized at epithelial cell junctions (arrows; Fig. 3A). In contrast,
there was little evidence of membrane expression of b-catenin or E-cadherin on -CXCR4-DCTD tumors. Cells injected
with and without Matrigel produced similar results.
Zo1 expression was membrane associated in mouse epidermis from normal skin (þcontrol) and MCF-7-vector
cells, but both cytoplasmic and membrane-associated for
MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells, and MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD cells
(Fig. 3C).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis have shown Ecadherin mRNA levels were significantly reduced in MCF-7CXCR4-DCTD cells (-211.3 fold) compared with vector,
whereas MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells showed no significant difference from control (Fig. 3B). No statistical difference was
found in Zo1 mRNA expression between MCF-7-vector and
MCF-7-CXCR4-WT or MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD cells (Fig. 3D). In
agreement with the EMT-like changes associated with
increased CXCR4 expression, significant increases in vimentin
were found in wild-type and truncated CXCR4-expressing cells
by qPCR (data not shown).
To further investigate the involvement of CXCR4 expression
on the EMT phenotype, MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells were treated
in culture with the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD-3100, a small
molecule CXCR4 antagonist that competes with ligand for
binding to the CXCR4 receptor (29, 30). Inhibition of CXCR4
signaling decreased gene expression of the EMT-associated
marker Vimentin, indicating that by blocking CXCR4 signaling
it is possible to reverse the CXCR4-induced progression of
breast cancer cells to a mesenchymal phenotype (P < 0.001;
Supplementary Fig. 2).

Hormone independent tumor growth of ER-positive
breast cancer is associated with CXCR4 expression
EMT-associated changes (decreased E-cadherin, increased
vimentin, decreased cell adhesion) are also correlated to
decreased ER expression (31). Previously conducted microarray analyses that revealed reduced ER expression in MCF-7CXCR4-DCTD cells compared with WT CXCR4 and vector
control (20), were confirmed by qPCR to reveal a 141.6-fold
and 9.6-fold decrease in ER expression in MCF-7-CXCR4DCTD and MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells, respectively (P < 0.001)

compared with control (data not shown). Xenograft tumor
samples stained for ER expression also showed reduced
expression of ER in MCF-7-CXCR4-DCTD tumors compared
with MCF-7-CXCR4-WT (data not shown).
Progressive loss of ER expression in CXCR4-WT and
CXCR4-DCTD cells suggests a role for CXCR4 expression
in ER(þ) breast carcinoma growth and progression. Stable
MCF-7-vector or MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells were injected
orthotopically into ovariectomized immunocompromised
mice in the presence or absence of exogenous estrogen.

Estrogen-dependent MCF-7-vector cells formed tumors
only in the presence of estrogen (Fig. 4A). Overexpression
of CXCR4-WT led to enhanced tumor growth in the presence
of estrogen (P < 0.05), and estrogen-independent tumor
formation (P < 0.05), showing that the CXCR4 axis drives
MCF-7 cells toward a hormone-independent but estrogenresponsive phenotype. Additional stable clones tested exhibited the same results in vivo confirming maintenance of
the phenotype across independently derived clones (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To validate its involvement in the promotion of breast
cancer tumorigenesis the CXCR4 axis was disrupted. Tumors
were established orthotopically by injection of MCF-7-CXCR4WT cells mixed with Matrigel containing anti-CXCR4 antibodies that block ligand binding or isotype IgG control. AntiCXCR4 antibodies suppress the hormone-independent tumorigenesis (Fig. 4B; P < 0.001) and estrogen-stimulated growth of
MCF-7-CXCR4-WT xenografts (Fig. 4C; P < 0.01).
AMD-3100 was used to further validate that CXCR4
mediated the enhanced tumorigenesis observed in vivo.
Animals injected with MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells orthotopically
were implanted with vehicle (Fig. 4D) or estrogen pellets

(Fig. 4E) and treated twice daily with vehicle or AMD-3100
for 14 days beginning same day of cell injection. Treatment
with AMD-3100 significantly suppressed estrogen-stimulated
(P < 0.01) and hormone-independent tumor growth (P < 0.001).
CXCR4 expression alters ER-mediated gene expression
and endocrine therapy response
Estrogen responsive gene expression of MCF-7-vector and
MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells was compared via RT-PCR. MCF-7vector cells displayed expected expression in response to
estrogen stimulation. Higher basal expression of ER-responsive genes (SDF-1, PGR, BCL2) was observed in MCF-7-CXCR4WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting CXCR4-signaling
targets estrogen responsive genes stimulating their expression
in the promotion of tumor growth. The possibility arose of an
autocrine SDF-1–CXCR4 loop within CXCR4 expressing cells
where basal or estrogen-stimulated SDF-1 expression and
secretion drives autocrine activation of CXCR4-mediated signaling and tumorigenesis.
Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780; ICI), an ER downregulator, was
used to block ER signaling in MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells resulting in suppressed estrogen stimulation of SDF1 and BCL2 gene

expression of VEGFA or PGR, suggesting that CXCR4 may also
function to mediate target genes independent of ER. Western
blot analysis of MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells confirms ICI downregulation of ER expression, though no change was observed
with SDF-1 treatment.

were injected orthotopically. ICI treatment (given once on day
7) resulted in reduced tumor volume and suppression of
control tumor growth, whereas cells injected in the presence
of exogenous SDF-1 treated with ICI continued to grow at
control levels. This suggests that an intact SDF-1–CXCR4
axis counteracts the action of antiestrogen therapy in ER
(þ)/CXCR4(þ) cells.
CXCR4 effects are mediated through ERK MAPK
signaling
Many signaling pathways have been implicated in CXCR4
and chemokine signaling, particularly MAPKs and AKT (13, 14,
32, 33). We have previously shown that SDF-1 treatment
induces a robust time-dependent increase in ERK1/2 activation in MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells (increased phosphoprotein
levels) (20). No significant changes in phospho-AKT levels
were detected. To verify the involvement of ERK signaling in
CXCR4(þ) cells, animals were randomized into treatment
groups after tumor formation and injected once/day (5 days)
with the MEK1/2 (MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK1/2 inhibitor
(PD184352) or vehicle. Treatment with PD184352 significantly
suppressed tumor growth of MCF-7-CXCR4-WT (Fig. 6A; P <
0.001), suggesting a role for CXCR4-MAPK signaling in the
hormone-independent growth of ER(þ)/CXCR4(þ) breast
carcinoma.
ERK1/2 signaling was also tested in connection with SDF-1–
mediated ICI resistance. MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells mixed with
Matrigel containing SDF-1 or vehicle were injected orthotopically. After tumor formation animals received daily injections (5 days) of vehicle or PD184135. On day 7, animals a
single injection of ICI. Treatment of PD184135 reduced SDF1–mediated ICI resistance significantly (P < 0.05); however,
suppression of CXCR4-positive tumor growth was not sustained past day 30 post–cell injection (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
The association of CXCR4 expression and breast cancer
metastasis has been well documented (34–36), however, the
effects of SDF-1–CXCR4 signaling on primary tumorigenesis
and disease progression is not well understood. We show
here that CXCR4 expression is highly correlated with
decreased breast carcinoma patient survival, as supported
by others (25, 37–39), likely due in part to the prominent role
of CXCR4 in cancer metastasis and chemotaxis. Downregulation of cadherins and other adhesion protein complexes
involved in cell-cell junctions leads to increased cell motility
and progression to metastasis (40, 41). Decreased membrane
expression of E-cadherin in MCF7-CXCR4-DCTD primary
tumors was observed. Additionally, treatment of MCF-7CXCR4-WT cells in cultures with AMD-3100 significantly
reduced the expression of vimentin. These results signify an
association with CXCR4 expression and the progression of
breast carcinoma cells toward EMT. Our orthotopic xenograft studies clearly show a role for CXCR4-mediated metastasis to SDF-1 rich organs (lung, liver) via regulation of the
CXCR4 CTD, and in primary tumorigenesis of ER(þ) breast
carcinoma.

Although CXCR4 has been implicated in the proliferation
and survival of primary breast carcinoma, these studies were
conducted using highly aggressive cells that mimic advanced
stage disease (8, 42). Here we utilized the MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line as a model cell system for ER-positive,
primary breast carcinoma. Interestingly, MCF-7-CXCR4DCTD primary tumors showed reduced nuclear staining
for ERa indicative of the progression to a more aggressive
and less differentiated phenotype. Intrigued by these results,
we sought to determine what role CXCR4 signaling plays in
primary tumor growth and progression to hormone independence.
MCF-7 cells are hormone-dependent and nontumorigenic
in nonestrogenic xenograft environments (43). Initial in vivo
studies conducted the ability of wild-type CXCR4 overexpression in MCF-7 cells to enhance tumor growth in the
presence of estrogen. Here we showed the ability of CXCR4
overexpression to promote MCF-7 tumor growth in the

absence of estrogen. This ability of CXCR4-mediated signaling
to facilitate escape from hormone dependence has not been
previously shown in vivo. The recent publication by Sauve and
colleagues showed ER–CXCR4 cross-talk in MCF-7 cells in
vitro (9). It was shown that CXCR4 activates ER-mediated gene
transcription via phosphorylation of ERb by members of the
MAPK family. This ER–CXCR4 cross-talk bypasses the need
for estrogen and initiates an autocrine feed-forward loop (9).
This model is supported by our gene expression data showing
higher basal expression for ER-responsive genes in the MCF-7CXCR4 cells, which retained estrogen sensitivity. Our work
further shows that estrogen activation of the ER increases
SDF-1 gene expression, which may drive CXCR4 signaling and
mediate estrogen-independent tumor growth. We have shown
previously that MCF-7-CXCR4-WT cells secrete higher levels
of SDF-1 compared with MCF-7-vector cells (99  5.8 and 43
 3.8 pg per 105 cells, respectively) (20). However, ICI 182,780
is able to block CXCR4-induced hormone-independent growth
and SDF-1 expression in MCF-7-CXCR4-WT and MDAMB-361–derived tumors. Exogenous SDF-1 treatment is able
to overcome the antitumor effects of ICI suggesting that the
endocrine therapy-resistance observed seems to be achieved
by ER-independent CXCR4 signaling mechanisms. Whereas
we believe that estrogen-independence is in part due to
ER-regulated gene expression (cross-talk) as suggested by
Sauve and colleagues (9), due to the ability of ICI to inhibit
CXCR4-mediated tumorigenesis. Our data support a more
complex model in which a combination of intrinsic CXCR4
signals respond to both autocrine produced and exogenously
derived SDF-1 to drive progression to an estrogen-independent phenotype. These results support the idea that breast
cancer progression may be associated with a switch from
dependence upon estrogen stimulated production of SDF-1, to
SDF-1 supplied by stromal cells (9). Although an autocrine
loop may exist between ER and the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis,
this system may also require the input of additional SDF-1
produced by tumor stromal cells to overcome endocrine
therapies.
Additional inquiry into this cross-talk led to examination of
specific signaling pathways. Both the MAPK and PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways have been implicated in chemokine signaling (44–46) and are known mediators of ER activity (47, 48).

These pathways are also involved in hormone-independent
tumorigenesis and the development of endocrine resistance
(14, 32, 33, 49, 50). Our data suggest that MAPK pathways,
specifically ERK1/2, are involved in CXCR4-mediated progression to hormone independence; however, the SDF-1–CXCR4
axis seems to regulate progression to antiestrogen resistance
through an alternate, non–ERK1/2-dependent, pathway
in vivo.
We have shown a compelling role for CXCR4 signaling in
the progression of ER-positive cancers to hormone-independent and therapeutic-resistant phenotypes. CXCR4 expressing
cells retain ER expression and estrogen sensitivity, but have
progressed to hormone independence and endocrine resistance. Blocking the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis through targeting of
CXCR4 or downstream MAPK signaling proteins decreased
these effects. Along with showing a novel role for CXCR4
signaling in primary breast carcinoma through cross-talk with
the ER, our data provide insight into the signaling mechanisms that regulate progression to hormone independence.
These data, by furthering our knowledge of the progression
of breast carcinoma, provide novel therapeutic targets for the
treatment of ER- and CXCR4-positive, hormone-independent
breast disease.
