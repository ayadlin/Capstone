BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major complication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study investigated
the association between nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) use and the risk of HCC and mortality in HBV carriers on the basis of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. METHODS: In all, 1544 HBV carriers taking NAs (treated cohort) who were identified
between October 1, 2003 and December 31, 2011 were examined for their risk of HCC and mortality; 1544 patients not receiving NA
treatment (untreated cohort) were selected via propensity score matching as the comparison group. The risks of first tumor occurrence and mortality were compared. RESULTS: The treated cohort had a significantly lower HCC occurrence rate (6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4%-7.9%) in comparison with the untreated cohort (8.5%; 95% CI, 6.6%-10.6%; P 5.0025). The overall mortality
rates for the treated and untreated cohorts were 6.9% (95% CI, 5.3%-8.7%) and 9.4% (95% CI, 7.7%-11.3%), respectively (P 5.0003).
After adjustments for competing confounders, Cox regression analyses showed that NA use significantly reduced the risk of HCC
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93; P 5.017) and overall mortality (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43-0.79; P <.001). There was a doseresponse relationship between NA use and the risk of HCC in the treated cohort. With respect to no NA use, the adjusted HRs were
0.93 (95% CI, 0.58-1.48), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42-1.06), and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.17-0.70) for 90 to 365, 366 to 730, and >730 cumulative
defined daily doses of NAs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NA use reduced the risk of HCC and overall mortality in HBV carriers.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, approximately 350 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the majority are
in Asia.1 Because chronic HBV infection leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), up to 25% of chronically
infected patients eventually die of cirrhosis or HCC.2 Fortunately, nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are effective for suppressing HBV replication and for ameliorating HBV-related liver disease.3 Studies have shown that treatments which
decrease HBV DNA levels also reduce the risk of HCC development in patients with cirrhosis, advanced fibrosis, or
chronic HBV.3
Within the past 10 years, NAs have been approved and shown to be successful in suppressing circulating viral
loads. Single-hospital, observational studies have shown that long-term NA treatment can reduce the HCC risk in
HBV-infected patients versus NA-naive patients.4,5 Wu et al.6 reported that the use of NAs decreased recurrence
among patients with HBV-related HCC after liver resection. However, no study has investigated the association of
NA use with HBV-related HCC and mortality in a nationwide HBV carrier cohort. In Taiwan, under the National
Health Insurance (NHI) program, NA treatment cost reimbursement for HBV patients meeting certain criteria

began on October 1, 2003.6 To be eligible for reimbursement, patients should have a high baseline HBV
viral load (2000 IU/mL), a high alanine aminotransferase level (23), or liver decompensation.
This study examined the association between NA
use and the risks of HCC and overall mortality in patients
with HBV-related HCC. We also investigated the doseresponse relationship between NAs and subsequent HCC
risk and calculated the numbers needed to treat (NNTs)
to achieve 1 less HCC occurrence and 1 less death.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

October 1, 2003 and December 31, 2011 were included
in our study cohorts. Patients were excluded if they were
diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (ICD-9
codes 042, 043, and V08), hepatitis C (ICD-9 codes
070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, 070.70, 070.71, and
V02.62), other viral hepatitis (ICD-9 code V02.69),
alcohol-related disease (ICD-9 codes 291, 303, 305.0,
357.5, 425.5, 535.3, 571.0, 571.1, 571.2, 571.3, and
790.3), or malignant tumors (ICD-9 codes 104-208); if
they received interferon or NA treatments before October
1, 2003; or if they used NAs for <90 days during or
before the observation period.

Data Sources

This nationwide cohort study retrieved all data for HBV
patients in Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research
Database (NHIRD). NHI is a mandatory universal health
insurance program that offers comprehensive medical care
coverage to all Taiwanese residents; up to 99% of Taiwanese residents have been enrolled in the program since
1996. The NHIRD, started in 1996, has been described
in detail in a previous study,7 and the accuracy of the diagnoses of major diseases, such as stroke and acute coronary
syndrome, in the NHIRD have been validated.8 The database consists of detailed health care data for more than 25
million enrollees. The NHI sample files consist of comprehensive utilization and enrollment information for a
randomly selected sample of 1,000,000 NHI beneficiaries, who represent approximately 5% of all enrollees in
Taiwan in 2000.7 A multistage, stratified, systematic sampling design was used. There were no statistically significant differences in sex or age between the sample group
and the total enrollees. To ensure the accuracy of the claim
files, the National Health Insurance Administration performs expert reviews of a random sample of every 50 to
100 ambulatory and inpatient claims in each hospital and
clinic quarterly.9 The comprehensive data include enrollment files, claims data, catastrophic illness files, and the
drug prescription registry. The confidentiality of the data
abides by the data regulations of the National Health Insurance Administration (Ministry of Health and Welfare
of Taiwan); all information that allows the identification
of a specific patient has been encrypted. This study was
approved by the National Health Research Institutes and
the institutional review board of National Yang-Ming
University (institutional review board 1000111).

Study Cohorts

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their
use of NAs. The untreated patients included patients
who never received NAs, and the treated cohort
included patients who received NAs for at least 90
days. NAs included lamivudine, telbivudine, entecavir, and tenofovir. We used an incident user design,
with follow-up for each patient beginning on the date
of the first NA prescription in the treated cohort.10
The follow-up for the untreated patients began the
day after the diagnosis of an HBV infection. To
address potential selection bias concerns, baseline
characteristics were adjusted with propensity scores
(PSs).11 PSs represented the probability of being a
treated patient according to baseline characteristics.
We performed a logistic regression to estimate the
probability with the baseline variables, which
included age, sex, and the comorbidities listed in Table 1; with the Charlson comorbidity index12 and the
use of statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), and metformin as independent variables;
and with the treatment status as a dependent variable.
The comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (ICD-9
code 250), hypertension (ICD-9 codes 401-405),
hyperlipidemia (ICD-9 codes 272.0-272.2), peptic
ulcer disease (ICD-9 codes 531-534), acute coronary
syndrome (ICD-9 codes 410-414), cerebral vascular
disease (ICD-9 codes 430-438), chronic renal failure
(ICD-9 code 585), autoimmune diseases (ICD-9
codes 710 and 714), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (ICD-9 codes 490-496), biliary stone disease
(ICD-9 code 574), and severity of hepatic fibrosis

Main Outcome Measurements

The diagnosis of HCC occurrence was defined by both
specific ICD-9 codes (155.0) and inclusion in the Registry
for Catastrophic Illness Patient Database, a separate subpart of the NHIRD.7 Histological confirmation or a typical HCC image presentation is required for a patient to be
registered in the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patient

Database. Patients diagnosed with HCC before or within
the first year of observation or who died within 1 year of
their index date were excluded. Each subject was followed
for a minimum of 1 year and for a maximum of 8 years
and 3 months. Patients were also excluded if they underwent liver resection, transarterial chemoembolization,
percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation,
or liver transplantation before the index date.
Both cohorts were followed until the date of the
HCC diagnosis, death, or the end of 2011. Death was
defined as the withdrawal of the patient from the NHI
program. This method of assessing mortality is justified
because NHI coverage is compulsory, and there are very
few occasions when a patient (especially an ill patient) can
and will drop the insurance coverage; in these instances,
death is the most probable cause.14 Moreover, because the
premium for NHI coverage is paid on a monthly basis,
the coverage can be easily dropped immediately after the
patient’s death. Thus, the ending date for NHI coverage is
a good proxy for a patient’s death.
Covariate Assessment

Because the chance of HCC occurrence can be confounded by competing mortality risks, we identified
comorbidities that may be associated with mortality
before the outcome of interest. Comorbidities included
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peptic
ulcer disease, acute coronary syndrome, cerebral vascular
disease, chronic renal failure, autoimmune diseases,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and biliary stone
disease. The severity of liver disease, including cirrhosis,
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome,
splenomegaly, jaundice, and esophageal varices, was also
analyzed. Certain drugs that might alter the risk of HCC,
including statins, aspirin, NSAIDs, and metformin, were
analyzed. Exposure to these drugs was defined as the
patient using more than 1 drug tablet per month during
the observation period.
Statistical Analysis

We used the PS matching method to reduce significant
differences in demographics between the treated and control groups. Death before tumor occurrence was considered a competing risk event. The calculations and
comparisons of cumulative incidences in the competing
risk data ratios were conducted with the modified KaplanMeier method,15 and the differences between the curves
were tested with the log-rank test. To determine the independent risk factors for HCC, multivariate analyses and
stratified analyses16 using hazard ratios (HRs) were

performed with the modified Cox proportional hazards
model17 in the presence of competing risk events. This
was performed after adjustments for age; sex; comorbidities; severity of cirrhosis; and use of statins, NSAIDs or
aspirin, and metformin. A potential numerical concern
regarding collinearity might have existed between the
covariates and rendered the estimated HRs invalid. Therefore, we assessed this concern by examining the variance
inflation factors, and we found no collinearity between
the covariates. Deaths before HCC development were
censored. In the multivariate stratified analyses, the association between NA use and the risk of HCC was examined
in different subgroups. All subgroup comparisons were
designed to control for the presence of potential confounding factors reported in previous studies.
The NNT represented the number of patients
who needed treatment to achieve 1 less HCC occurrence or death; it was calculated as the inverse of the
absolute risk reduction. We used SAS 9.3 software (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) to link the data and Stata 12 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) to perform the
statistical analyses. Calculated results were expressed as
the estimated number together with the 95% confidence
interval (CI). Significance was defined as P < .05 for all
2-tailed tests.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

Data for 1,001,932 patients were obtained from the
NHIRD; patients were excluded because of missing sex
data (260), human immunodeficiency virus infection
(1190), prior interferon treatment (2266), non-HBV
hepatitis (17,547), and alcoholism (24,521). After also
excluding 934,777 healthy subjects, we identified 25,367
patients with HBV infections; additional patients were
excluded because of cancer diagnosed before the index
date (1716), an HCC diagnosis within a year of the index
date (920), no record of HBV after October 1, 2003
(2047), the receipt of NAs for <90 days (413), death
within a year of the index date (586), and follow-up for
<1 year (1294). In all, there were 1544 treated patients
and 18,392 prematched, untreated patients (Fig. 1). In
the treated cohort, 1269 patients received a single NA,
including lamivudine (515 patients), entecavir (666), telbivudine (76), and tenofovir (12); the remaining patients
received more than 1 NA.
Baseline demographic characteristics, confounding
drugs, comorbidities, cirrhosis severity, and follow-up
durations for the study patients are presented in Table 1.

Original Article

The mean follow-up duration for the treated cohort was
5.3 years (standard deviation [SD], 2.3 years), and the median was 5.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 3.4-7.4
years). For the prematched, untreated cohort, the mean
follow-up was 5.4 years (SD, 2.1 years), and the median
was 5.8 years (IQR, 3.8-7.3 years). After one-to-one PS
matching, 1544 matched, untreated individuals were
selected, and the baseline patient characteristics of the 2
groups became similar (Table 1). The mean duration of
NA use in the treated patients was 1.6 years (SD, 0.9
years), and the median was 1.4 years (IQR, 0.9-2.0 years).

During the observation period, 53 patients in the treated
cohort (3.4%) and 87 patients in the untreated cohort
(5.6%) developed HCC (P 5 .004). Death before the diagnosis of HCC was defined as competing mortality. In
contrast to the untreated cohort (72 deaths or 4.7%), only
46 patients (3.0%) died before the diagnosis of HCC in
the treated cohort. During the follow-up period, the overall numbers of deaths for the untreated and treated
cohorts were 112 (7.3%) and 65 (4.2%), respectively.
The cumulative incidence of HCC after adjustments for
competing mortality is shown in Figure 2A. The risk of
HCC occurrence was significantly lower for patients in
the treated cohort (8.25-year cumulative incidence, 6.0%;
95% CI, 4.4%-7.9%) versus patients in the untreated
cohort (8.5%; 95% CI, 6.6%-10.6%; P 5 .0025). The
unadjusted NNT associated with 1 less HCC occurrence
within 8.25 years was 46 (95% CI, 27.3-135.8), and this
suggested that the use of NAs in 46 HBV-infected
patients was associated with 1 less HCC occurrence
within an 8.25-year period.
There was a dose-response relationship between
NA use and the risk of HCC (Fig. 3). In comparison
with no NA use, the adjusted HRs were 0.93 (95% CI,
0.58-1.48), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42-1.06), and 0.35 (95%
CI, 0.17-0.70) for patients with 90 to 365, 366 to
730, and >730 cDDDs of NAs, respectively. Because
cDDD is a continuous variable, the use of arbitrary
cutoff values (91-365, 366-730, and >730) may be
misleading. To assess the dose-dependent association of
HCC with NA use, we analyzed cDDD as a continuous variable in the modified Cox proportional hazards
model. There was also a risk reduction with increasing
cDDDs of NAs (1 more cDDD: HR, 0.9985; 95%
CI, 0.9975-0.9994; P 5 .002).
Similarly, the risk of overall mortality was significantly lower for patients in the treated cohort (8.25-year

a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR, 0.58; 95%

Subgroup Analyses

Multivariate stratified analyses revealed that NA use was
associated with a reduced risk of HCC in most subgroups
(Fig. 4). In general, the patients with higher risks—male
sex or the presence of cirrhosis—had the greatest reduction in the risk of HCC (Fig. 4). These observations further confirmed the association between NA use and an
attenuated risk of HCC in HBV-infected patients. Similar
trends were observed for overall survival according to subgroups (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
This large, nationwide, population-based cohort study
shows that NA therapy is associated with a reduction in

HCC and mortality hazards. The magnitude of protection conferred by NAs is substantial, with a reduction of
36% for HCC and a reduction of 42% for mortality for a
median period of treatment of 1.4 years. In patients
undergoing treatment for longer than 730 days, the magnitude of protection can be as high as 65% for HCC. This
treatment effect consistently favored the treated cohort
across the majority of prespecified subgroups.
The role of HBV in HCC occurrence has been
widely investigated. HBV infection may induce chronic
hepatic inflammation, which, in turn, orchestrates the
tumor-supporting microenvironment that is indispensable for carcinogenesis.18 Although HBV infection is generally accepted to contribute to HCC occurrence, studies
regarding the effectiveness of NAs for preventing HCC
occurrence have been limited.3-5 Proving the preventive
effect of NAs on the development of HCC is very difficult
because randomized control studies are not ethically possible. Liaw et al.3 reported that treatment with lamivudine
reduced the risk of HCC in patients with chronic HBV

and cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis. However, their
randomized clinical trial was restricted to a highly select
and homogeneous population, which limited the ability
to generalize the findings. The other reports are hospitalbased studies with limited numbers of observations and
the possibility of selection bias.4,5 In this study, we used
NHI claims data to perform this nationwide cohort study,
and this allowed us to observe the temporal relationship
between HBV infection and HCC. In Taiwan, reimbursement for oral antiviral agents for HBV infections is strictly
limited to specified indications. Most of the HBVinfected patients in the current study were not ill enough
to fulfill the NHI criteria for oral antiviral therapy.
Previous studies have confirmed that advanced age,
male sex, viral load, use of drugs, comorbidities, and cirrhosis are factors associated with the development of
HCC.19,20 Therefore, we selected factors, including age,
sex, drugs that might alter the risk of HCC (including statins, aspirin, NSAIDs, and metformin), comorbidities,
Charlson comorbidity index, and markers of hepatic

fibrosis severity (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, splenomegaly, jaundice, and esophageal
varices), for PS matching. In contrast to the entire population, these propensity-matched patients were well
matched to patients using NAs, and they permitted us to
make better comparisons than previous studies. We confirmed the association between NA use and a reduced risk
of HCC and improved overall survival for HBV-infected
patients.
NA use has been reported to be associated with a
lower risk of developing HCC,4-6,21 but no previous
report has studied the dose-response relationship and the
effect on survival. To test a potential dose-response relationship, we summed the doses of NAs and stratified NA
use as untreated and 91 to 365, 366 to 730, and >730
cDDDs. This enabled us to detect a statistically significant
inverse trend between the dose and the cumulative incidence of HCC. These results prove that using NAs
reduces the risk of HCC, and they suggest that longer use
of NAs should be practiced for the treatment of HBVinfected patients.
There were, however, contradictory results regarding
the association between HCC and statin, metformin, and
NSAID or aspirin use.20,22,23 In the multivariate analysis,
NSAID or aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of
HCC, whereas statin and metformin use was not. This
difference may be partly explained by publication bias,
the study setting, and whether the studies adjusted for
other risk factors. Future randomized controlled trials are
necessary to clarify this issue.
Our study suggests that long-term NA use would
significantly suppress the development of HCC in HBVinfected patients versus HBV-infected patients in the control group. The treatment effect was more prominent
among patients with a high risk of HCC (patients with
cirrhosis and male patients) than those at low risk. The
lower treatment effect among the lower risk patients was
not surprising. HCC development among low-risk
patients is generally rare; therefore, the treatment effect
may not have occurred in sufficiently large numbers of
patients during the treatment period to enable the detection of a difference. A study with a longer observation period and higher patient numbers might be necessary to
examine the NA treatment effect among low-risk patients.
The major strength of our study is its nationwide,
population-based setting: it included a relatively large number
of HBV-infected patients and allowed a clear observation of
the temporal relationship between HBV treatment and HCC
as well as an assessment of the NA dose-response effect. In
addition, this study showed that NAs can prevent HCC in
1454

most HBV-infected subgroups. However, this study did have
some limitations. First, the patients in the study cohorts may
have differed in many measured and unmeasured ways. To
avoid these biases, we used PS matching to make the 2
cohorts similar in their baseline characteristics and to minimize bias. A multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for
potential confounders. Furthermore, we conducted multivariate, stratified analyses to examine the risk of HCC in different strata. Second, reimbursement for oral NAs for HBV
infection in Taiwan is strictly limited to patients in high-risk
populations. This attenuated our estimation of the benefit of
NA treatment. Third, some patients may have paid for NAs
themselves and may have been inappropriately placed into
the untreated cohort. Conversely, NAs users in the treated
cohort may have had poor compliance. These potential misclassifications may have resulted in an underestimation of the
reported associations. Fourth, HBV infection and HCC
could have been diagnosed concurrently because HCC does
not occur within 1 year of HBV infection. To avoid this bias,
we excluded HCC cases diagnosed before or within 1 year of
HBV infection.
In conclusion, this nationwide, prospective study of
NA use in patients with chronic HBV has shown that
NAs decrease the risk of HCC and mortality. The doseresponse effects strengthen the causal relationship and
support the use of NAs for patients with chronic HBV by
means of viral suppression.
