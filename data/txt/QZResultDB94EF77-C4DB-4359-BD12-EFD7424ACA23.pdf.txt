BACKGROUND: In a phase 3 study, the authors assessed the effects of dasatinib at doses of 140 mg once daily and
70 mg twice daily in patients who had either chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in advanced phases or Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and were resistant or intolerant to imatinib. In the current report,
the results for patients with CML in blast phase after 2 years of follow-up are reported. METHODS: Patients were
stratified according to whether they had CML in myeloid blast phase (MBP-CML) or in lymphoid blast phase (LBPCML) and were randomized (1:1) within each stratum to receive either oral dasatinib 140 mg once daily or 70 mg
twice daily. RESULTS: In patients with MBP-CML, the major hematologic response rate was 28% for both regimens;
and, in patients with LBP-CML, the major hematologic response rate was 42% for once-daily dasatinib and 32% for
twice-daily dasatinib. The major cytogenetic response rates were 25% for once-daily dasatinib and 28% for twicedaily dasatinib in patients with MBP-CML, and the respective rates in patients with LBP-CML were 50% and 40%. The
overall survival rate at 24 months was 24% for once-daily dasatinib and 28% for twice-daily dasatinib in patients with
MBP-CML, and the respective values in patients with LBP-CML were 21% and 16%. Adverse events indicated a trend
toward improved tolerability for the once-daily regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that dasatinib
140 mg once daily had similar efficacy and improved tolerability relative to the 70-mg twice-daily regimen in patients

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who progress from the chronic phase (CML-CP) to the blast phase
(CML-BP) have a poor prognosis.1 In these patients, conventional chemotherapy regimens are of limited value, and 2year survival rates after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) do not exceed 20%.1 CML is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which encodes the oncogenic breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral fusion protein (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase.2 Although BCR-ABL gene expression is sufficient for the initiation
and sustenance of CML-CP, blast crisis often is characterized by additional molecular and cytogenetic defects. It is
believed that these defects are orchestrated through both BCR-ABLdependent and BCR-ABLindependent

mechanisms.2 Imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec; Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland) is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) used in the treatment of CML.3,4 Whereas this
drug has dramatically improved the prognosis for patients
with CML-CP, hematologic remission with imatinib in
CML-BP are low (remission rate, 7.9%-26%) and of
short duration (median, 6-10 months).4-6
The development of primary and acquired imatinib
resistance involves multiple mechanisms, including BCRABL mutations and activation of the SRC family of kinases (SFK).7,8 Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb,
New York, NY), a multikinase inhibitor that has an in
vitro potency against unmutated BCR-ABL 325 times
greater than that of imatinib, inhibits most known BCRABL mutants.9,10 Dasatinib also inhibits other tyrosine
kinases, including the SFK.9 Orally administered dasatinib has produced consistent clinical benefit in patients
with CML-CP, CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP),
CML-BP, and Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib and is
approved for use at a dosing regimen of 70 mg twice
daily.11-15 A phase 3 dose-optimization study in patients
with imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML-CP demonstrated that dasatinib 100 mg once daily had similar efficacy and improved tolerability relative to 70 mg twice
daily16; consequently, the currently recommended initial
dasatinib dose for these patients is 100 mg once daily.
Because once-daily regimens had not been evaluated
for advanced-phase CML, a phase 3 trial was designed to
assess the efficacy and tolerability of dasatinib 140 mg
once daily versus 70 mg twice daily in patients with CMLAP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL who had hematologic
resistance or intolerance to imatinib. Data from a 2-year
follow-up of that study are available now, and the results
from the CML-BP subset are reported here.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3
study. Written informed consent was obtained from each
patient. The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the appropriate ethics committees/institutional review boards (National
Clinical Trials [NCT] identifier, NCT00123487).
Key inclusion and exclusion criteria that we used for
patients with CML-BP who had resistance or intolerance
to imatinib were described previously.14 Imatinib resistance was defined as no hematologic response to imatinib

after 4 weeks, or an increase 50% in peripheral blood
blasts after 2 weeks of treatment with imatinib 600 mg
daily, or losing a hematologic response while receiving
imatinib 600 mg daily. Imatinib intolerance was
defined as grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity or grade 4
hematologic toxicity that lasted >2 weeks on imatinib
600 mg daily and led to imatinib discontinuation or
dose reduction to 400 mg daily with loss of hematologic
response.
Patients who had CML-BP were stratified according
to disease subtype: namely, myeloid blast phase CML
(MBP-CML) and lymphoid blast phase CML (LBPCML). Patients within each stratum were randomized 1:1
using a permuted block procedure to receive oral dasatinib
at either 140 mg once daily or 70 mg twice daily (Fig. 1).
For inadequate responses, dasatinib doses could be
escalated to 180 mg once daily or 90 mg twice daily
within the respective treatment groups. The dose also
could be reduced to 100 mg once daily and then 80 mg
once daily for the once-daily regimen and to 50 mg twice
daily and then 40 mg twice daily for the twice-daily
regimen for toxicity. The criteria that we used for dose
escalations, reductions, and interruptions were described
previously.14
Efficacy Assessment
Hematologic responses, including complete hematologic
response (CHR), no evidence of leukemia (NEL), and
minor hematologic response (MiHR), were defined as
described previously.14 Although the CHR definition
incorrectly included a peripheral blood basophil count
<20%, a review of patients who had a confirmed CHR
indicated that the peripheral blood basophil count <2%
in all 37 patients except 1 patient with MBP-CML who
had a peripheral blood basophil count of 6% and 1 patient
with CMP-LBP who had a peripheral blood basophil
count of 3.3%. A major hematologic response (MHR),
the primary efficacy endpoint, was defined as achieving a
confirmed CHR or NEL. A confirmed hematologic
response had to meet all criteria for at least 28 consecutive
days.
Secondary endpoints included major cytogenetic
response (MCyR), times to and durations of MHR and
MCyR, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival
(OS), and safety. The definitions that we used for cytogenetic responses, including complete cytogenetic response
(CCyR) and partial cytogenetic response (PCyR), were
described previously.14 An MCyR was defined as either a
CCyR or a PCyR.

Figure 1. This is a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in
blast phase. QD indicates once-daily dasatinib; BID, twice-daily dasatinib; AE, adverse event; SCT, stem cell transplantation.

Complete blood counts were monitored weekly
until Week 20, then monthly up to 1 year, and every 3
months thereafter. Differential and cytogenetic assessments of bone marrow were conducted at the end of
Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 and every 6 months
thereafter.
Disease progression was defined as the loss of MHR
or MiHR in responding patients over 2 consecutive weeks
after starting the maximum dasatinib dose, or no reduction from baseline percentage blasts in peripheral blood or
bone marrow over 4 weeks after the start of therapy, or an
increase 50% in the peripheral blood blast count over 2
weeks, or death for any reason. PFS was calculated as the
time from randomization to either disease progression,
death, or discontinuation because of progression. Patients
who neither progressed nor died were censored on the
date of last cytogenetic or hematologic assessment. OS
was calculated as the time from randomization to death,
and patients who had not died or who were lost to
follow-up were censored on the last date they were known
to have been alive.
Leukocytes were prepared from blood samples that
were collected from patients at baseline. Total leukocyte
RNA was extracted, and BCR-ABL messenger RNA was

3854

amplified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction. BCR-ABL point mutations were assessed by
direct sequencing.
Safety Assessment
Adverse events were assessed continuously and graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0;
National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md).
Statistical Analysis
The study was powered to evaluate noninferiority by analyzing the difference of MHR rates between the dasatinib
once-daily and twice-daily schedules in the combined
CML-AP, CML-BP, and Ph-positive ALL populations.
Because this report focuses only on the CML-BP subset,
formal comparisons between the 2 dosing regimens
cannot be made and are descriptive. Efficacy analyses
included all randomized patients, and safety analyses
included all treated patients. Durations of MHR, MCyR,
and CCyR were calculated using patients who achieved
these responses. Response rates with 2-sided, exact 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the
Clopper and Pearson method. The Kaplan-Meier

No data were available for 1 patient with CML in lymphoid blast phase who was randomized to receive dasatinib 70 mg twice daily.

RESULTS

Baseline disease characteristics and demographics
were similar between the once-daily and twice-daily regimens for both patient cohorts (Table 1). Both cohorts had
prolonged periods of previous CML and advanced disease. Patients in both cohorts were pretreated extensively
with imatinib and other therapies and mostly were imatinib resistant.

Patient Characteristics and Disposition
Of 210 patients with CML-BP from 62 sites who were
randomized to receive either dasatinib 140 mg once daily
or 70 mg twice daily, 149 patients had MBP-CMP, and
61 patients had LBP-CML (Fig. 1). At the 2-year followup assessment, 12 patients with MBP-CML (once-daily
regimen, 5 patients; twice-daily regimen, 7 patients) and
1 patient with LBP-CML (twice-daily regimen) were still
on the study. The remaining patients discontinued treatment for multiple reasons, with disease progression the
most common cause for discontinuing treatment on
once-daily and twice-daily regimens in both patient
cohorts (Fig. 1). Nine patients with MBP-CML and 6
patients with LBP-CML left the study to pursue stem cell
transplantation (SCT).

Hematologic Response
In patients with MBP-CML, the rate of confirmed MHR
was 28% for both regimens, including a 17% CHR rate
for the once-daily regimen and an 18% CHR rate for the
twice-daily regimen (Table 2). The median time to MHR
was 2 months for the once-daily regimen and 3 months
for the twice-daily regimen, and the respective median
MHR duration was 8 months and 9 months (Table 2).
In patients with LBP-CML, the rate of MHR was
42% for the once-daily regimen and 32% for the twicedaily regimen (Table 2). The median time to MHR was
2 months for both regimens, and the median MHR
duration was 5 months for the once-daily regimen and 8
months for the twice-daily regimen (Table 2).

Computed from Kaplan-Meier analysis in patients who achieved this response.
b
The analysis excluded 10 Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients. Cytogenetic response could not be determined among patients with CML in myeloid
blast phase for 22 patients in the QD arm and 23 patients in the BID arm or among patients with CML in lymphoid blast phase for 8 patients in the QD arm
and 9 patients in the BID arm.

In both patient cohorts, 2 regimens produced similar rates of MHR in patients with or without baseline
mutations (Table 2). None of the patients who had the
threonine-to-isolucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I)
BCR-ABL mutation (2 patients with MBP-CML and 4
patients with LBP-CML) achieved an MHR with either
dosing schedule.
Cytogenetic Response
For the analysis of cytogenetic response, Ph-negative
patients were excluded in both the MBP-CML cohort and
the LBP-CML cohort. In patients with MBP-CML, the
MCyR rates were 25% for the once-daily regimen and
28% for the twice-daily regimen, including CCyR rates of
14% for the once-daily regimen and 21% for the twicedaily regimen (Table 2). The median time to and duration
of MCyR with the once-daily regimen (1.9 months and
7.7 months, respectively) were similar to those with the
twice-daily regimen (1.6 months and 10.1 months,
respectively) (Table 2). The median time to and duration
of CCyR with the once-daily and twice-daily regimens
generally were similar (Table 2).

3856

In patients with LBP-CML, the MCyR rates generally were similar between the once-daily (50%) and twicedaily (40%) regimens, and the CCyR rates also were similar (38% vs 36%, respectively) (Table 2). The median
times to MCyR and CCyR ranging from 1.4 months to
1.8 months were similar between 2 regimens. The median
durations of MCyR and CCyR in the once-daily arm
were 4.0 months and 4.9 months, respectively, and those
in the twice-daily arm were 7.0 months and 7.9 months,
respectively (Table 2).
Of the 15 patients who discontinued the study treatment to pursue SCT, 12 patients achieved a cytogenetic
response (CCyR, PCyR, or minimal cytogenetic
response), and only 5 patients achieved a hematologic
response (CHR or NEL) (Table 3).
Progression-Free Survival
Among the patients with MBP-CML, the median PFS
was similar between the once-daily arm (3.8 months) and
the twice-daily arm (3.7 months). The 24-month PFS
rate was 11% for the once-daily regimen and 18% for the
twice-daily regimen (Fig. 2a). Among the patients with

LBP-CML, the median PFS was similar between the
once-daily arm (4.7 months) and the twice-daily arm (4.8
months) (Fig. 2b).
Overall Survival
Among the patients with MBP-CML, the median OS was
similar between the once-daily arm (7.9 months) and the
twice-daily arm (7.7 months), and the 24-month survival
rates also were similar (24% vs 28%, respectively) (Fig.
2c). The majority of deaths were considered to be from
CML in both the once-daily arm (54%) and the twicedaily arm (41%). Among the patients with LBP-CML,
the median OS also was similar between the once-daily
arm (11.4 months) and the twice-daily arm (9.0 months).
The 24-month OS rate was 21% for the once-daily arm
and 16% for the twice-daily arm(Fig. 2d). The majority
of deaths were considered to be from CML in both the
once-daily arm (30%) and the twice-daily arm (43%).
Safety
Treatment-related nonhematologic adverse events generally were grade 1 or 2 (Table 4). The more common
events were fluid retention, diarrhea, headache, bleeding,

Cancer

nausea, fatigue, and rash. Rates of nonhematologic grade
3/4 events were similar between the 2 regimens in both
the MBP-CML cohort and the LBP-CML cohort. The
rates of pleural effusion (all grades) in patients with MBPCML were similar between the once-daily arm (20%) and
the twice daily arm (18%), whereas there was a trend
favoring the once-daily regimen (21%) over the twicedaily regimen (36%) in patients with LBP-CML. The
occurrence of grade 3/4 pleural effusion was 6% in both
treatment arms, and there was only 1 grade 4 event. Cytopenias were common with similar incidence between the
2 regimens in both patient cohorts (Table 4). Twentythree patients in the MBP-CML cohort (once-daily arm,
7 patients; twice-daily arm, 16 patients) and 6 patients
in the LBP-CML cohort (once-daily arm, 5 patients;
twice-daily arm, 1 patient) discontinued because of drug
toxicity.
Exposure and Dose Modifications
Patients with MBP-CML received similar median average

Figure 2. These Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate (a,b) progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who had chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) in (a) myeloid blast phase and (b) lymphoid blast phase and (c,d) overall survival in patients who had CML in (c) myeloid
blast phase and (d) lymphoid blast phase. For PFS analysis, patients who neither progressed nor died were censored on the date
of their last cytogenetic or hematologic assessment. For overall survival analysis, patients who had not died or were lost to
follow-up were censored on the last date they were known alive. QD indicates once-daily dasatinib; BID, twice-daily dasatinib;
CI, confidence interval.

(Table 5). In patients with LBP-CML, the median average
daily doses were 140 mg on the once-daily regimen and
123 mg on the twice-daily regimen, and the corresponding median treatment durations were 3.4 months and 3.6
months, respectively (Table 5). The rates of dose interruption in the MBP-CML cohort were similar between 2 regimens; whereas, in the LBP-CML cohort, there were
fewer interruptions in the once-daily arm compared with
the twice-daily arm (Table 5). In both the MBP-CML
cohort and the LBP-CML cohort, the once-daily regimen
(18% and 27%, respectively) necessitated fewer dose
reductions than the twice-daily regimen (32% and 39%,
respectively), and the majority of reductions were because
of nonhematologic toxicities (Table 5). Dose escalation in
the MBP-CML cohort was necessary for more patients

who received once-daily dosing (49%) compared with
twice-daily dosing (22%), whereas the escalation rates in
the LBP-CML cohort were similar between the 2 treatment arms (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
The 2-year follow-up results reported here demonstrate
that hematologic and cytogenetic response rates and the
time to and duration of these responses generally were
similar between the dasatinib 140 mg once-daily regimen
and the 70 mg twice-daily regimen in both the MBPCML cohort and the LBP-CML cohort and that the durations and rates of PFS and OS also were similar. Although
the most clinically relevant adverse events generally were

similar between the 2 regimens, in patients with LBPCML, pleural effusions occurred less frequently on the
once-daily regimen (21%) than on the twice-daily regimen (36%). In addition, in both patient cohorts, the
once-daily arm had fewer dose reductions or interruptions
because of toxicity compared with the twice-daily arm.
Although the subset analyses presented here were not
powered adequately to detect small differences, similar efficacy and improved tolerability between the schedules
were observed consistently in patients with CML-AP or
Ph-positive ALL, 2 other subsets that were studied in this
phase 3 trial.17,18 In addition, an earlier phase 3 trial in
patients with CML-CP demonstrated similar efficacy for
4 different dasatinib schedules, including 140 mg once
daily, 70 mg twice daily, 100 mg once daily, and 50 mg
twice daily, and the 100 mg once-daily regimen had a
superior safety profile.16 Taken together, these observations lead to the conclusion that dasatinib 140 mg once
daily may have efficacy and improved safety similar to
those of the 70 mg twice-daily regimen in patients with
CML-BP.
Our efficacy and safety results are consistent with
the pharmacodynamics and pharmacology of dasatinib.
Consistent with a plasma terminal half-life of 3 to 4 hours
of oral dasatinib, the twice-daily dose produced a more
sustained inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase, as monitored by the phosphorylation of the substrate, than the
once-daily dosing.19 In patients with CML-CP, the dasatinib trough concentration (Cmin) was correlated with tolerability, suggesting that increased toxicity with the twicedaily dose may be a reflection of persistent target inhibition.19 Because it was demonstrated that transient
exposure of CML lines to dasatinib in vitro caused an inhibition of apoptosis that lasted for 48 hours, it has been
hypothesized that peak plasma levels cause the persistent
inhibition of cell proliferation.20,21 The improved peak
plasma level and reduced Cmin of dasatinib after oncedaily oral administration provides a biochemical rationale
for similar efficacy and improved tolerability of 140 mg
once daily relative to 70 mg twice daily.
In addition to supporting the view that the oncedaily regimen of dasatinib has similar efficacy and is likely
to be tolerated better than the twice-daily regimen, even
in the most advanced phases of the disease, the current
results also reinforce the notion that dasatinib is highly efficacious in these conditions. Before entering our study,
patients who had suffered from CML for a prolonged period (median, 23-41 months) were in blast phase for a median of at least 4 months, underwent extensive treatment,

3860

and failed on imatinib. Given the dismal clinical status of
these patients and their lack of effective therapeutic
options, the current data on dasatinib are important.
Dasatinib treatment induced high response rates, both hematologic and cytogenetic, with good durability in some
patients. The median OS duration and the 24-month OS
rates across both schedules were reasonable in the MBPCML cohort (median OS duration, 7.7-7.9 months; 24month OS rate, 24%-28%) and the LBP-CML cohort
(median OS duration, 9.0-11.4 months; 24-month OS
rate, 16%-21%). On the basis of these results, a lower
incidence of recurrence and improved clinical benefit
probably could be expected with dasatinib treatment earlier in the course of CML-BP, when patients have received
less pretreatment. Patients with CML-BP at diagnosis
probably also could benefit from dasatinib as first-line
treatment rather than as second-line treatment after
failure on imatinib.
Short response duration because of disease recurrence or progression is a clinical challenge for these
patients. Allogeneic SCT after a TKI-induced remission
offers a highly desirable option to sustain a remission in
these patients, because this approach may eradicate the
Ph-positive clone. The use of dasatinib after SCT also
could prove beneficial in maintaining a remission. Data
are limited, however, on the outcomes of SCT after TKI
treatment in patients with CML after imatinib resistance
or failure22 and are particularly limited on the use of TKIs
after patients have undergone SCT.23 Only a minority of
patients with CML-BP (15 of 210 patients) in the current
study discontinued dasatinib to undergo SCT, and these
included patients who had not achieved a cytogenetic
response during dasatinib therapy (Table 3), underscoring
the very poor clinical status of the patients with CML-BP
who were investigated. The encouraging efficacy of dasatinib in this study indicates the potential utility of dasatinib
for improving the outcome of allogeneic SCT in patients
with CML-BP.
In conclusion, the current analysis of 210 patients
confirms and extends the results from 2 previous phase 2
studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasatinib
70 mg twice daily in patients with CML-BP who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib.13,14 The analysis further
demonstrates that dasatinib 140 mg once daily generally
has similar efficacy and a trend toward improved tolerability compared with the 70 mg twice-daily regimen in these
patients. Our data support the use of 140 mg once daily as
a starting dose for the treatment of patients with CML-BP
who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.
