ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) currently lacks a suitable therapeutic
candidate and is thus difficult to treat. Here, we report that a cationic antimicrobial
peptide (CAP), tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4), which was derived from Nile tilapia
(Oreochromis niloticus), is selectively toxic to TNBC. TP4 acts by inducing an AP-1
protein called FOSB, the expression of which is negatively associated with the
pathological grade of TNBC. We show that TP4 is bound to the mitochondria where
it disrupts calcium homeostasis and activates FOSB. FOSB overexpression results in
TNBC cell death, whereas inhibition of calcium signaling eliminates FOSB induction
and blocks TP4-induced TNBC cell death. Both TP4 and anthracyclines strongly induced
FOSB, particularly in TNBC, indicating that FOSB may be suitable as a biomarker of
drug responses. This study thus provides a novel therapeutic approach toward TNBC
through FOSB induction.

INTRODUCTION

normally zwitterionic [13, 14]. This characteristic
allows some selective cytotoxic agents, such as cationic
antimicrobial peptides (CAPs), to attack cancers through
electrostatic interactions [15–17]. Cationic antimicrobial
peptides (CAPs) are evolutionarily conserved components
of the innate immune system, integral for activity against
pathogens [18, 19]. The defensive capabilities of CAPs
arise from their structures, which allow them to penetrate
anionic bacterial membrane [16, 20] or cancer cells with
negatively-charged outer membrane [21–23]. Treatment
of cancer cells with large amounts of CAPs leads to
transient membrane lysis [14, 24–29]. However, low
concentrations of CAPs can trigger apoptosis [30, 31]
and/or necrosis of cancer cells [24, 32–34]. Mechanisms
of cancer killing by CAP involve changes in calcium
homeostasis and induction of activator protein-1 (AP-1)
[14, 23, 31, 35]. Calcium signaling appears to be activated
early on in response to CAP-induced stress, and enhances
downstream AP-1 signaling [23]. AP-1 members form
a dimer with proteins of the JUN proto-oncogene
(c-JUN) family (c-JUN, JUNB, JUND) or FBJ murine
osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) family
(c-FOS, FOSB, FRA1/2). The dimer composition of
AP-1 activates downstream gene expression in response
to cellular stimuli or in different cellular contexts, as
well as controlling cell fate decisions [36]. In TNBC,

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy
that causes death in women. Global gene-expression profile
studies have classified breast cancers into different subtypes
[1–3]. The subtypes which lack expression of estrogen
receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are clustered
as triple negative BC (TNBC:ER-/PR-/HER2-). Hormone
or targeted therapies are not usually effective against
TNBC, with the exception of anthracycline or taxane-based
conventional chemotherapy [4, 5]. However, TNBC patients,
even after treatment with chemotherapy, often present with
distant metastases and have poor prognosis. The main cause
of chemotherapeutic agent failure is the development of
multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells under standard
regimens [6], and chemotherapy also causes adverse sideeffects [7]. Use of non-cross-resistant drugs [8–11] or
biological agents [12] in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs is a possible option for TNBC patients with metastases.
However, even though such options improve the outcome,
the prognosis of metastatic TNBC patients remains poor.
Metastatic cancer cells that respond poorly
to treatment usually possess negatively-charged
phosphatidylserine (PS) or anionic structures on their
outer membrane, in contrast to healthy cells that are

FRA1 controls tumor cell growth and metastasis through
repression of CDH1 in poorly differentiated cells [37, 38]
which lack FOSB expression [39, 40]. However, little is
known about the role of FOSB in TNBC.
TNBC cells with negatively-charged PS may be good
candidate for CAP-based therapy. In the present study,
we investigate the therapeutic potential of a CAP, tilapia
piscidin 4 (TP4), derived from Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis
niloticus) [41] for treatment of TNBC. Transcriptome
analyses of TNBC cells and normal fibroblasts were
carried out to identify potential molecular targets of TP4.
The mechanism of action was investigated using in vitro
BC cell models. The therapeutic efficacy of TP4 was
further evaluated through intratumoral injection of null
mice bearing BC xenotransplants. In addition, zebrafish
embryonic models have been shown to have metastatic
potential in BC xenografts, and the optical transparency of
this model organism enables the study of tumor growth and
metastasis [42]. Here, we employed zebrafish as a second
model for testing the therapeutic potential of TP4 in vivo.

Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that TP4 treatment
caused dramatic changes in the gene expression profiles
of TNBC cells (Figure 2A and 2B), but minor changes
in HDF cells (Figure 2B). Of note, FOS members
(FOSB, c-FOS) and ATF3 were significantly induced in
TNBC cells (Figure 2B). Immunocytochemical studies
and Western blotting confirmed that FOS members,
particularly FOSB and FOSΔB (a truncated splice variant
of FOSB), were induced in tested BC cell-lines (Figures
2C-2E and Supplementary Figure S2A-S2D). Unlike
JUNB and JUND, cJUN was not significantly influenced
in TNBC cells (Figure 2D and 2E). Neither FOS nor JUN
family members were significantly activated in control
HDF cells (Figure 2D and 2F). To explore the therapeutic
role of FOSB, we investigated whether FOSB induction
could be observed in TNBC cells during treatment with
anthracycline or taxane-based chemotherapeutic agents.
Interestingly, anthracyclines (doxorubicin and epirubicin)
(Figure 2G, lanes 3 and 4) induced strong FOSB
expression, comparable to that induced by TP4 treatment
of TNBC cells (Figure 2G, lane 2). Taxane-based agents
(docetaxel and paclitaxel), however, induced FOSB in
MDA-MB453 (denoted as MB453) and MCF7 cells, but
not in MB231 cells (Figure 2G, lanes 5 and 6). These
findings suggest that TP4 and anthracyclines act through
a similar therapeutic pathway in TNBC cells. In addition,
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant
effect of TP4 treatment on MAPK signaling (Table 1);
this signaling pathway is known to increase AP-1 activity
[43], and we further examined the molecules involved
by Western blotting. We observed that active forms of
both JNK and p38 were significantly decreased by TP4
treatment in TNBC cells, but not in control HDF cells
(Supplementary Figure S3A-C). Activation of ERK
proteins had no significant effect (Supplementary Figure
S3A and S3B), but inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059
disrupted TP4-induced TNBC cell death, as shown by
MTS assay (Figure 2H); these findings suggest that ERK
signaling is required for TP4-activated cell death.

RESULTS
TP4 induces selective necrosis of TNBC cells
Different molecular subtypes of BC cell-lines
(MDA-MB231, MDA-MB453, and MCF7) were
subjected to the MTS assay to investigate whether TP4
can selectively kill BC cells in vitro. It was observed that
treatment with 15 μg mL-1, 5.03 μM of TP4 is sufficient to
kill over 50% BC cells at 6h, while the same dose had only
minor effects on the viability of control normal human
mammary epithelial cells (M10) or dermal fibroblasts
(HDFs) (Figure 1A–1E, statistical analyses are shown in
Supplementary Table S1). Genomic DNA samples from
TP4-treated MDA-MB231 cells (denoted as MB231)
were taken at different time-points and subjected to a
DNA laddering assay; no obvious DNA fragmentation
was observed after TP4 treatment, indicating that TP4
does not induce apoptosis in TNBC cells (Figure 1F).
In addition, TUNEL staining of TP4-treated MB231 or
HDF cells revealed very limited DNA fragmentation
(Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B) and no obvious
caspase3 activation was observed in TP4-treated TNBC
cells (Supplementary Figure S1C and S1D). On the other
hand, a necrotic marker, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
was significantly increased at 3h post-TP4 treatment in
TNBC cells (Figure 1G). Taken together, these findings
indicate that TP4 induces necrotic death in TNBC cells.

TP4 induces FOSB to trigger TNBC cell death
Strong induction of FOSB by TP4 in TNBC cells
suggested possible involvement of FOSB in TP4-activated
TNBC cell death. A previous study indicated that FOSB is
highly expressed in normal ductal mammary epithelium,
but not in poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma [40].
To address whether FOSB expression is associated with
TNBC progression, we analyzed FOSB expression in
various grades of tumor samples from TNBC patients by
immunohistochemical analysis. Expression of FOSB in
breast normal adjacent tissue (NAT, N = 26) was found
to be stronger than expression in grade II (N = 19) and
grade III (N = 10) TNBC samples (Figure 3A, P < 0.001).
Grade I samples (N = 6) showed a trend towards decrease,

FOS family members were induced by TP4
in TNBC cells
To characterize the downstream events which
contribute to TP4-induced TNBC death, we analyzed
gene expression profiles through microarray studies.

Description

were 1.4:1, 1.4:1, 3.5:1, and 8.8:1, respectively (Figure
3J). Cells treated with TP4 exhibited a 1.4 and 2.8 fold
increase of c-FOS and FOSB activity, respectively, as
compared to mock controls (P = 0.0291 and P < 0.001)
(Figure 3J); such an increase was not observed for FRA1
(P = 0.5593, Figure 3J). Interestingly, c-JUN activity was
decreased by TP4 treatment (P = 0.0272) (Figure 3J).
Coimmunoprecipitation of cJUN confirmed an association
between c-JUN and FRA1 (Figure 3K), and the cJUNFOSB immunocomplex was identified after TP4 treatment
of TNBC cells (Figure 3L). These results suggest that the
induction of FOSB by TP4 in TNBC cells possibly alters
AP-1 complex composition and thereby causes cell death.

but were not statistically different to NAT (Figure 3A).
These results indicate that FOSB expression is decreased
during TNBC progression, and suggest that FOSB may
be detrimental to TNBC development. We then evaluated
whether the induction of FOSB by TP4 is associated with
TNBC death. As demonstrated by Western blotting, the
increase of FOSB in TNBC cells treated with TP4 is timedependent (Figure 3B) and is correlated with the timing of
TP4 induced-cell death (Figure 1A). Transient expression
of FOSB or FOSΔB (0.1-0.4 μg) in TNBC cells resulted in
substantial cell death as compared to the vehicle control,
as determined by ATP assay (Figure 3C, P < 0.001).
Interestingly, TNBC cells were more resistant to FOSΔB
expression than FOSB expression, at high concentration
(Figure 3C, P < 0.001). We proceeded to examine whether
FOSB knock down disrupts TP4-activated TNBC cell
death. FOSB-knockdown MB231 cells were generated
through transduction with lentiviral particles containing 4
specific shRNA constructs (19-25 nucleotides, including
the hairpin). Our Western blotting data indicate that TP4
treatment caused significant FOSB induction in control
cells (P < 0.01), but not FOSB-knockdown cells (Figure
3D and 3E). The results acquired from MTS assay showed
that FOSB knockdown significantly protected MB231
cells against TP4-induced death (Figure 3F). We next
investigated whether the molecular composition of AP-1
complexes are influenced by strong induction of FOSB
in TNBC cells. It was previously shown that FRA1 is
associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) as a key factor involved in TNBC progression
[38]; however, the level of FRA1 was not influenced by
TP4 treatment, as shown by immunoblotting (Figure 3G
and 3H). Surprisingly, levels of CDH1 were significantly
increased (Figure 3G and 3I), but those of other EMTrelated proteins (ZO1, Integrin α5, Vimentin, αSMA,
and SNAI1, Figure 3G) were unaffected. We proceeded
to determine the activity of each FOS family member.
AP-1 activation was quantified by incubating nuclear
extracts from TNBC cells treated with or without
TP4 with oligonucleotides containing a tetracycline
response element (TRE); DNA-protein complexes were
subsequently isolated using antibodies against c-FOS,
FOSB, FRA1, and c-JUN. In the absence of TP4 (mock
control), the signal-to-background ratios of c-FOS, FOSB,
FRA1, and c-JUN activation (represented by OD450)

TP4 causes mitochondrial dysfunction
To characterize the mechanism of action of
TP4 and the role of FOSB induction, we examined
the cellular localization of TP4 in TNBC cells. Cells
treated with biotinylated TP4 (14 μg mL-1) for 1h were
co-stained with biotin, organelle-specific antibodies/
dye (Calreticulin for the ER; Giantin for the Golgi; and
MitoTracker for the mitochondria), and fluorescent dyeconjugated WGA (for the plasma membrane). TP4 was
observed to be bound to the Golgi, mitochondria, and
plasma membrane as evidenced by strong co-localization
of the biotin signal with Giantin (Figure 4A, indicated
by white arrows), MitoTracker (Figure 4B, indicated
by white arrows), and WGA (Figure 4A–4C, indicated
by yellow arrows), but not with the ER (Figure 4C).
Importantly, only weak background staining against
biotin was observed in the nuclei of the HDF control
(Figure 4D), suggesting that normal cell membranes are
unlikely to be recognized by TP4. The observation that
TP4 is selectively bound to the mitochondria led us to
examine whether TP4-activated BC toxicity is associated
with mitochondrial dysfunction. Immunocytochemical
staining through potential-dependent accumulation of
MitoTracker revealed a significant loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential in TNBC cells at 3 and 6h postTP4 treatment as compared to the control group (P <
0.001) (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure S4A),
while no significant difference was observed for HDF
cells (Figure 4F and Supplementary Figure S4B). We
next investigated whether FOSB induction contributes

TP4 inhibits tumor growth in a nude mouse
xenograft model

to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in
TNBC cells. FOSB knockdown partially prevented the
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in response to
TP4 treatment as compared to the control cells (Figure
4G, Supplementary Figure S4C and S4D). Interestingly,
FOSB-transfected cells showed a significant loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential compared to untransfected control or vector transfected control (Figure
4H and Supplementary Figure S4E-G). These findings
suggest that TP4 induces a loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential prior to FOSB induction; subsequent
FOSB induction may further contribute to mitochondrial
dysfunction.

To evaluate the effects of TP4 treatment on tumor
growth in vivo, we subcutaneously transplanted TNBC
cells into nude mice (N = 5), and assessed tumor growth
daily for 28 days. A group of nude mice with xenografts
were treated with TP4 every two days once the tumor
reached a certain size. Significant differences in tumor
growth between control (KY jelly alone) and TP4 (KY
jelly plus TP4)-treated groups were observed (P < 0.001)
(Figure 6A and 6B). TP4-treated tumors grew into
smaller tumor masses than those of control groups (P =
0.0017) (Figure 6C, left), but no significant differences
in body weight were observed between each group of
mice (Figure 6C, right). Control experiments showed
that KY jelly (10 μL plus 50 μL distilled water) was well
absorbed after injection into age-matched control nude
mice (Supplementary Figure S5A and S5B). Pathological
studies confirmed that a large portion of the central region
is necrotic in intratumoral TP4-treated groups (Figure 6D).
A dramatic decrease in cells positive for the proliferation
marker Ki-67 was observed in tumor tissue sections from
TP4-treated groups, paralleling the macroscopic findings
(Figure 6E, left). In addition, FOSB expression was also
detected within the tumor (Figure 6E, right). Collectively,
these results indicate that TP4 kills TNBC cells in vivo.

Mitochondrial calcium leakage caused by TP4
induces FOSB
In our earlier work, we showed that CAP induces
AP-1 to trigger cancer cell death through calcium
signaling [23]. We next examined whether Ca2+
homeostasis is influenced by TP4 treatment in TNBC
cells. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured using
fluo-4 Ca2+ indicators at 5-30 min after treatment of
TNBC cells with TP4 (Figure 5A). A significant increase
in the Ca2+ levels of cells treated with 5-20 μg mL-1 TP4
for 5 min as compared to the mock control (P < 0.001)
was observed, indicating that TP4 treatment altered Ca2+
homeostasis in TNBC cells. However, it is likely that
TP4 does not bind the ER (Figure 4C), the intracellular
Ca2+ store, but instead binds the mitochondria (Figure
4A and 4B), which takes up Ca2+ released from the ER,
suggesting that the increase of intracellular Ca2+ may
be due to leakage from mitochondria. We tested this
possibility by using a mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator,
Rhod-2 AM, to dynamically monitor the Ca2+ level
upon TP4 treatment. We observed that the Ca2+ levels
in cells treated with 5-20 μg mL-1 TP4 for 30 min
exhibited a trend towards decrease as compared to the
mock control (P < 0.001), indicating that TP4 treatment
disrupted Ca2+ dynamics in mitochondria (Figure 5B).
In addition, we addressed whether TP4-induced, Ca2+triggered stress responses cause downstream FOSB
induction. Pre-treatment of TNBC cells with BAPTAAM, a Ca2+ chelator, prior to TP4 treatment disrupted
FOSB induction and TP4-activated TNBC cell death,
as compared to the mock control (Figure 5C–5E).
Moreover, application of AIP II, a calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase (CaMK) II inhibitor, to block
Ca2+-triggered downstream signaling resulted in a trend
towards decrease, but not complete block, of FOSB
induction compared to mock control (Figure 5F and
5G) and partly prevented TP4-induced TNBC cell death
(Figure 5H). Overall, these results indicate that TP4 is
bound to the mitochondria, disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis,
and ultimately induces downstream FOSB to activate
TNBC cell death (Figure 5I).

TP4 prolongs the survival of TNBC xenograft
zebrafish
To further investigate the therapeutic ability of
TP4, we generated a TNBC xenograft zebrafish model
with which to study the ability of TP4 to inhibit TNBC
migration and invasion. A schematic indicating the
treatment procedures and analytic approaches used
in this study is shown in Supplementary Figure S6.
Fluorescence reporter TNBC cell-lines were first obtained
by transfection of M10 or TNBC cells with eGFP or
mOrange2 expression vectors, followed by antibiotic
selection (Supplementary Figure S7A). Survival analysis
at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) revealed no obvious
toxic effects of injection of non-tumorigenic eGFPexpressing M10 cells (800-1,200 cells per embryo,
zebrafish survival rate > 90%, Figure 7A). In contrast,
injection of eGFP- and mOrange2-expressing TNBC
xenografts showed an unexpected increase in zebrafish
embryo mortality at 168 hpf to about 38.3% and 44.8%,
respectively (Figure 7A). Before evaluating the therapeutic
activity of TP4, we examined TP4 toxicity in zebrafish.
Serial dilutions of TP4 (0.125 ng mL-1-20 μg mL-1) were
added to the zebrafish culture medium; we observed that
TP4 doses of 1 and 2 μg mL-1 had no obvious toxic effects
on normal zebrafish (Supplementary Figure 7B). However,
further testing revealed poor therapeutic efficacy of these
doses in eGFP-expressing TNBC xenograft zebrafish

S1 and S2). TNBC xenograft zebrafish that received a
single treatment of TP4 (3 μg mL-1) exhibited prolonged
survival in comparison with the non-treated group (92.6%
vs 65.6%, P < 0.05) (Figure 7H, Supplementary Movies
S3 and S4), and also contained reduced quantities of
TNBC, as revealed by a gradual decrease in xenograft
TNBC tumor area (Figure 7I) and fluorescence intensity
(Figure 7J). These findings indicate that TNBC metastasis
and invasion are possibly a major cause of zebrafish death,
and that TP4 treatment eliminates TNBC growth in vivo.

(Supplementary Figure S7C and S7D). As most wildtype zebrafish (> 75%) treated with 3 μg mL-1 (1.01 μM)
TP4 were still viable at 168 hpf (Supplementary Figure
S7B), we used this dose in subsequent experiments. TP4
(3 μg mL-1, administered daily) treatment significantly
prolonged survival of eGFP- and mOrange2-TNBC
xenograft zebrafish (78.9% and 82.5%) in comparison
with mock-treated groups (P = 0.0149 and P < 0.0001,
respectively) (Figure 7A). The therapeutic efficacy of
TP4 in a single xenograft zebrafish was determined by
quantitation of the eGFP fluorescent signal through days
0-5 (48-168 hpf). In control M10 xenograft zebrafish, the
eGFP fluorescent signal exhibited a gradual trend towards
decrease; however, such a trend was not observed in
TNBC xenograft zebrafish (Figure 7B, left and center). In
the TP4-treated groups, the eGFP fluorescent intensity was
significantly decreased through days 2-5 in comparison
with the mock control (P < 0.001), indicating a positive
therapeutic effect of TP4 in vivo (Figure 7B). To address
the mechanism underlying TP4 treatment, we performed
whole-mount staining to determine whether TP4 treatment
exerted any TNBC cell-autonomous effects. We report that
TNBC cells in the TP4-treated group, but not the mocktreated group, presented with positive FOSB staining
(Figure 7C). In addition, the xenograft tumor area (P <
0.05 compared to the non-treated group) and the numbers
of disseminated tumor foci (P < 0.01 at day 1 compared to
the non-treated group) were decreased upon TP4 treatment
(Figure 7D and 7E). Together, these results indicate that
TP4 may contribute to autonomous elimination of TNBC
through FOSB induction. We also investigated whether
any non-TNBC cell autonomous effects induced by TP4
benefit cancer cell elimination in vivo. To this end, the
expression profiles of certain genes involved in innate
immunity against some pathogen infections in zebrafish
embryo were determined by qPCR [44]. We observed
that application of TP4 (3 μg mL-1, administered daily)
to wildtype zebrafish generally resulted in a significant
decrease of immune gene expression over time
(Supplementary Figure S8A-S8G, left), except at some
specific time-points (Il8 increased at Day 1 and Il10/
Ifnϕ1 increased at day 5); however, TP4 treatment had
no significant effects on Tnfα expression (Supplementary
Figure S8E, left) as compared with the un-treated control.
In TNBC xenograft zebrafish embryos, TP4 treatment was
observed to significantly enhance immune responsive gene
expression at around day 2 (Supplementary Figure S8A-G,
right) as compared to un-treated groups. These results
suggest that TP4 may enhance innate immunity in TNBC
xenograft zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, the finding that
TNBC xenografts enhance mortality in zebrafish led us to
further investigate the mechanisms involved through highcontent imaging. Time-lapse imaging revealed that TNBC
cells migrated and invaded developed blood vessels,
causing substantial abdominal edema, curvature of the
trunk, and death (Figure 7F, G, Supplementary Movies

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report that TP4 is selectively toxic
to BC cells. In vitro and in vivo evidence indicate that
TP4 may be suitable as a novel agent to treat TNBC. TP4
damages TNBC cells through the ERK/FOSB/cJUN axis
controlled by Ca2+ signaling. Activation of FOSB in TNBC
requires Ca2+, which is transduced by selective binding of
TP4 to the mitochondria. In addition, induction of CDH1
by TP4 may also contribute to TNBC suppression. Widelyused anthracyclines also induced FOSB in TNBC cells.
This finding, together with the observation that FOSB
overexpression triggers TNBC cell death, indicates that
FOSB may be a novel therapeutic candidate.
Alteration of AP-1 transcription factor activity is
sufficient to promote tumorigenesis [36–38]. We have
shown that the level of FOSB is significantly decreased
in grade II/III TNBC samples (moderately differentiated
or poorly differentiated tumor) (Figure 3A); this is in
agreement with previous reports of strong FOSB expression
in normal breast epithelia or well-differentiated breast
tumor [39, 40]. These results suggest that a molecular
switch of FOS family member expression (from c-FOS/
FOSB to FRA1) occurs during TNBC progression. FRA1
has been shown to control the development of aggressive
breast cancers, as well as TNBC [37, 38, 45–47]. High
levels of FRA1 activate genes involved in EMT to trigger
TNBC proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [38, 45].
We showed that the level of FRA1 is not altered by TP4
in TNBC. However, the tumor suppressor protein CDH1,
which is known to be suppressed by FRA1-associated
signaling, was induced by TP4 (Figure 3G and 3H). This
finding suggests that the FRA1-driven EMT program may
have been disrupted by FOSB-induced changes in the
dominant AP-1 complex in TNBC cells (Figure 5I). We also
observed that the activities of both JNKs and p38 MAPKs
were suppressed by TP4 in TNBC cells, but not in HDF
cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). JNKs and p38 both
possess oncogenic or tumor-suppressive functions [48]. In
TNBC, both kinases are required for tumor development
and progression, as mediated through cJUN/AP-1-activated
signaling pathways [38, 49, 50]. Here, the decrease of
JNKs and p38 activities in MB231 cells may destabilize
cJUN/FRA1 or other cJUN/AP-1 complexes, leading to
the transcriptional inactivation of genes involved in TNBC

cell progression. Interestingly, FOSB exhibits differential
patterns of post-transcriptional regulation among different
subtypes of BC. A greater proportion of full-length
FOSB transcripts were found to be induced by TP4 or
anthracyclines in MCF7 cells; conversely, less full-length
but more FOSΔB transcripts were found in MB453 cells
(Figure 2G). Since overexpression of high concentrations
of FOSΔB is less toxic than FOSB overexpression to
MB231 cells (Figure 3C), it is possible that the FOSB, and
not FOSΔB, predominantly contributes to BC cell death.
In support of this possibility, MB453 cell re-growth was
observed at 12h post-TP4 treatment, while MCF7 and
MB231 cells did not regrow (Figure 1A–1C).
Anthracyclines, but not taxane-based drugs,
strongly induce FOSB in BCs; anthracyclines kill cancer
cells through causing torsional stress and nucleosome
destabilization [51, 52]. An earlier study showed that
doxorubicin causes histone eviction and transcriptome
alterations in cancer cells [53]; therefore, FOSB may be a
suitable biomarker for the response to anthracyclines in BC
cells. The mechanisms by which TP4 and anthracyclines
induce FOSB and trigger BC cell death are different. While
some BC-targeting peptides were reported to be localized to
the nucleus and cause DNA fragmentation [14], we did not
observe a strong nuclei staining pattern of TP4 in BC cells
(Figure 4A–4D), suggesting that TP4 may not influence
the transcriptome in BC cells through the same manner as
anthracyclines. In addition, doxorubicin treatment increased
the mitochondrial Ca2+ level in BC cells [54] and triggered
apoptotic cell death [55]. TP4, however, caused Ca2+
leakage from mitochondria (Figure 5B), leading to necrosis
(Figure 1E and 1G). Blockage of Ca2+ signaling with the
calcium chelator eliminated FOSB induction and disrupted
TP4-induced cell death (Figure 5C–5E); however, we did
not examine whether FOSB induction by anthracyclines
can be eliminated through Ca2+ blockage, and whether
elimination of FOSB activation can disrupt anthracyclineinduced BC cell death. Furthermore, we observed that
the induction level of FOSB in TNBC cells is higher than
that in MCF7 and MB453 cells. It is not known whether
hormonal or HER2 receptor status in different subtypes
of BC correlates with the efficacy of chemotherapy and
the induction levels of biomarkers. Elucidation of crosslinks between signaling pathways may facilitate greater
understanding of drug resistance in different BC subtypes.
Intratumoral injection of TP4 caused extensive
necrosis of TNBC in xenograft tumor (Figure 6D and 6E)
without causing adverse side-effects (Figure 6C), suggesting
that intratumoral injection of TP4 may be of practicable use
for further therapeutic regimens. Another critical concern is
that necrotic cell death caused by TP4 may trigger severe
immunogenicity in vivo and further damage surrounding
tissues. Non-apoptotic cell death is more immunogenic than
apoptotic cell death, as it triggers heat shock protein (hsp)
induction [56]. Analysis of the microarray results revealed
significant induction of a series of HSP genes (refer to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Supplementary Datasheet S1), suggesting that strong
immunogenicity may be induced by TP4 in vivo, but may
not be observed in assays using immunodeficient null mice.
However, intratumoral injection of CAP has been proposed
to exert dual actions against tumor xenografts through
directly inducing tumor lysis and subsequent activation
of immune responses [57]. Here, we observed that innate
immunity was enhanced by TP4 treatment in both zebrafish
embryos and TNBC xenograft embryos (Supplementary
Figure S8). An enhancement of immune responsive gene
expression was observed in TNBC xenograft embryos,
particularly at days 1-3 (Supplementary Figure S8A-G,
right). As TP4 did not appear to cause an overall induction of
immune responses in normal embryos, we propose that the
immunity may be enhanced by the self-defense mechanism
against TNBC xenografts in zebrafish embryo. In addition,
it is possible that amphiphilic TP4 can passively diffuse into
embryos [42] and directly or indirectly cause TNBC death,
which may trigger further immune responses. Our results
support the hypothesis that non-TNBC cell autonomous
effects in zebrafish embryo exist and help eliminate cancer
cells; however, the key players involved (e.g. neutrophils
and macrophages) and the signaling pathway(s) required for
their activation still need to be identified.
In conclusion, we have identified (i) TP4 as a novel
cytotoxic peptide possibly suitable for breast cancer
therapy, and (ii) FOSB as a biomarker of the response to
TP4 and anthracyclines, particularly in TNBC. In contrast
to previous reports that TNBC can be suppressed through
FRA1 signaling inhibition, we observed that TNBC cell
growth can be disrupted by FOSB activation. Therefore,
our findings are of importance for TNBC treatment
through modulation of AP-1 levels. FOSB plays an
opposing role to FRA1 in the regulation of TNBC fate
decision.

(BCRC) and the standard cell culture procedures and
conditions provided by the BCRC were followed. HDF
cells were cultured as previously described [23]. With the
exception of MB231 and MB453, all cells were cultured at
37°C with 5% CO2. For the cell viability and transfection
assay, 1 × 104 cells [5 × 103 M10 cells were seeded and
cultured for 48h to allow the cells sufficient time for
attachment] were seeded into the wells of a 96-well plate
and cultured overnight. For the transfection assays, cells
were transfected with 0.1-0.4 μg FOSB/FOSΔB expression
plasmid (Origene Technology Inc.) and cell viability
was determined after 72h. The transfection efficiencies
(number of cells expressing eGFP/all cells) of the MB231
transfection assays were determined by observing
ten randomly selected fields (from three independent
transfections) of control GFP plasmid transfections under
an inverted microscope (Olympus, IX71) coupled to a
digital camera (Olympus DP80), using an 10× objective
lens (LCPlanFI 20× /0.40 Ph1). CellSens standard
software (Olympus) was used for image acquisition.
During the drug treatment assay, inhibitors (PD98059,
BAPTA-AM, and AIP II) were added 30 min prior to TP4,
and cell viability was determined at indicated time-points.
Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE™3000
(ThermoFisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Knock-down cells were generated
by transducing MB231 cells with pre-synthesized
FOSB (or control) shRNA lentiviral particles (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and selecting puromycin-resistant
cells in accordance with the manufacturer’s standard
protocol. MB231 or M10 cells stably expressing eGFP
or mOrange2 were generated through transfection with
peGFP-puromycin or pmOrange2-C1 plasmid, followed
by puromycin (5 μg mL-1) or G418 (500 μg mL-1) selection
as described above.

cultured overnight. Culture media were replaced with fresh
medium containing 1% FBS and cells were subsequently
treated with different doses of TP4 (2.5-20 μg mL-1).
Supernatants were harvested at 3h. After centrifugation at
200× g for 5 min to remove cell debris, supernatants were
collected and 50 μL were aliquoted from each well into a
new microplate. Reaction mixtures were then added and
incubated for 15 min at RT. Stop solution was added to
the well, and absorbance at 490 nm was determined with a
reference wavelength of 600 nm.

DNA laddering assay
DNA fragmentation was analyzed using the SuicideTrack™ DNA Ladder Isolation Kit (EMD Millipore) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s standard procedures.
Sufficient DNA samples from TP4 treatment groups were
extracted by collecting cells from three (control) or seventeen
(TP4-treated groups) 10 cm2 dishes. Precipitated DNA
samples were analyzed by 1.5× agarose gel electrophoresis.

Transcriptome analysis
Total RNA samples were extracted from MB231
and HDF cells treated with TP4 (14 μg mL-1) for 6h.
Total RNA (0.2 μg) was amplified using a Low Input
Quick-Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, USA),
and the cDNA was labeled with Cy3 (CyDye, Agilent
Technologies, USA) during the in vitro transcription
process. Cy3-labled cRNA (0.6 μg) was fragmented
to an average size of about 50-100 nucleotides by
incubation with fragmentation buffer at 60°C for 30 min.
Corresponding fragmented labeled cRNA was then pooled
and hybridized to an Agilent SurePrint G3 Human V2
GE 8×60K Microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA) at
65°C for 17h. After washing and drying using a nitrogen
gun blowing, microarrays were scanned with an Agilent
microarray scanner at 535 nm to detect Cy3. Scanned
images were analyzed using Feature extraction 10.5.1.1
software (Agilent Technologies, USA); image analysis and
normalization software was used to quantify signal and
background intensity for each feature.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was quantitatively analyzed using
the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit
(ATP assay) and CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay) (Promega) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. For MTS
assay, 1 × 104 cells were seeded into the wells of a 96-well
plate and cultured overnight [5 × 103 M10 cells were seeded
and cultured for 48h to enable sufficient well attachment].
Cells were subsequently treated with different doses of TP4
(2.5-20 μg mL-1) and harvested at the indicated time-points
(3-24h). Reaction mixtures (20 μL : MTS+PMS, using a
ratio 20:1) were directly added to the cells, and the plates
were incubated for 3h at 37°C. Absorbance at 490nm is
directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture
and was measured using a photometer (SpectraMax®

Immunocytochemical, immunohistochemical,
and whole-mount studies
The plasma membrane and mitochondria were
stained by pre-incubating biotinylated-TP4 treated cells
(14 μg mL-1, 3h) with Alexa Flour 647 dye-conjugated
wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (5 μg mL-1) (ThermoFisher
Scientific) for 10 min at 37°C or with MitoTracker® Red
CMX-ROS probe (200 nM) (ThermoFisher Scientific) for
45 min at 37°C prior to cell fixation. Cells were then fixed
with 4% PFA (in PBS) for 15 min, and permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 12 min at RT. After
blocking with 5% BSA in PBST, the cells were incubated
overnight at 4°C with Biotin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,

Giantin (Abcam, 1:1000), or FOSB (1:500) antibody. Cells
were then washed three times with TBS-T (20 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20), and
incubated for 1h at RT with secondary antibodies (1:500;
ThermoFisher Scientific) conjugated to the appropriate
fluorescent dye. Hochest33342 was used for nuclear
staining. The fluorescent signal (which is proportional to
functional mitochondria) was quantitatively determined
using Image J software. Human breast adjacent normal

measurement of primary tumor area.

in accordance with Academia Sinica guidelines and were
approved by the “Ethical Committee for using vertebrates
as experimental animals”. AB line zebrafish (Danio rerio)
were provided by the Taiwan Zebrafish Core Facility
(Academia Sinica). The transgenic line (fli:eGFP) was
purchased from JY LIN Trading Co., Ltd (Pingtung,
Taiwan). Tumor cell xenotransplantation protocols were
performed in accordance with previously published
methods with modifications [58, 59]. Briefly, six-monthold adult AB or transgenic strain zebrafish were used for
mating. Fertilized zebrafish eggs were incubated at 28°C
in E3 embryo medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33
mM MgSO4) containing 0.2 mM PTU (Sigma). After dechorionization at 24 hpf (hour-post-fertilization), eggs
were soaked in E3 medium with tricaine (0.02 mg mL1
, Sigma). After 24h (48 hpf), embryos were orientated
on a 1.8% agarose-modified microinjection plate. Tumor
cells (2 × 106 of MB231 or M10 cells expressing eGFP/
mOrange2) were suspended in 25 μL Matrigel® matrix
(12.0 mg mL-1) solution (Corning), and 10-15 nL cell
suspensions were microinjected into embryos (parameters
were set at 7.0 psi and 0.5-1.0 secs). Xenografted embryos
were placed in a 96-well black plate with a clear bottom
(Coring) and then immobilized with methyl cellulose (1.25
μL); images were obtained with an inverted microscope
(Olympus IX71) equipped with a camera (Olympus
DP80), using a 4× objective lens (Olympus UPlanFI
4×/0.13 phL). On every subsequent day for 5 days, the
media in each well were replaced with fresh E3 media
containing TP4 (3 μg mL-1), and images were obtained.
The fluorescent signal (which is proportional to the
number of eGFP-expressing cells) was quantitatively
determined using Image J software. For time-lapse studies,
immobilized and xenograft embryos received a single
dose of TP4 or mock treatment before imaging and were
incubated at 28°C for 48h. Images were obtained using
the ImageXpress Micro HCS Image System (Molecular
Devices). Images (including z stacks) were recorded under
a 4× objective lens (Plan Fluor 4×/0.13,) at 1h intervals,
using transmitted light and the FITC (EX 482/35, EM
536/40) and TRITC (EX 543/22, EM 593/40) filter sets.
Every channel was captured from 5 images along the
z-axis across a distance of 70 μm, and was composited
to the best-focus image. Images were taken and tumor
analysis was performed using the integrated MetaXpress®
program (v.5.3, Custom Module Editor) to quantify the
area and fluorescence intensity of the tumor inside the
zebrafish. Normalized data are expressed relative to the
value at 0h.

Mice and pathological studies
Mice were maintained in pathogen-free sterile
isolators, according to the guidelines of the Council
of Agriculture (COA, Taiwan), and all food, water,
caging, and bedding were sterilized before use.
The animal protocol (103034) was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of the College of Life Science, National Taiwan Ocean
University. Female BALB/c nu/nu mice were obtained
from BioLASCO Taiwan, Co., Ltd., and housed at the
Laboratory Animal Facility, National Taiwan Ocean
University, Keelung, Taiwan. For the TP4 treatment assay,
nude mice with pre-growth MB231 tumors (n = 5 for each
group) were subcutaneously injected with TP4 [500 μg
in 50 μL distilled water plus 10 μL KY jelly (Johnson &
Johnson)] every two days for a total of fourteen times,
by which time the tumors had reached an average volume
of 30-50 mm3 in size. Age-matched control nude mice
without tumor xenografts were injected with KY jelly (10
μL plus 50 μL distilled water). Tumor size was calculated
every two days, using the following formula: volume =
[(height×length×width) × 3.1416]/6. Mice were sacrificed
28 days after the beginning of TP4 treatment, and the
tumors were harvested and weighed. Tumor samples
were fixed with formalin and embedded with paraffin.
Paraffin sections were stained by Hematoxylin & Eosin
(H&E) and immunostained with Ki-67 antibody (Cell
Signaling, clone D2H10, 1:100). Images were obtained
with an inverted microscope (Olympus, IX71) coupled to
a digital camera (Olympus DP80), using a 10× (UPlanFI
10× /0.30 Ph1) and 40× (LUCPlanFI 40× /0.60 Ph2)
objective lens. CellSens standard software was used for
image acquisition. Fluorescent images were obtained with
an FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope, using a
10× objective lens (UPlanSApo 10×, N.A. 0.40). ASW2.1
software was used for image acquisition and analysis.

Statistical analysis
