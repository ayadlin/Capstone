Abstract
Therapeutics that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can enhance the cytotoxic effects
of ionizing radiation (IR). However, predictive genomic biomarkers of this radiosensitization have remained
elusive. By screening 40 non–small cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC) lines, we established a surprising positive
correlation between the presence of a KRAS mutation and radiosensitization by the EGFR inhibitors
erlotinib and cetuximab. EGFR signaling in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells promotes chromatin condensation
in vitro and in vivo, thereby restricting the number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) produced by a
given dose of IR. Chromatin condensation in interphase cells is characterized by an unexpected mitosis-like
colocalization of serine 10 phosphorylation and lysine 9 trimethylation on histone H3. Aurora B promotes
this process in a manner that is codependent upon EGFR and protein kinase C a (PKCa). PKCa, in addition
to MEK/ERK signaling, is required for the suppression of DSB-inducible premature senescence by EGFR.
Blockade of autophagy results in a mutant KRAS-dependent senescence-to-apoptosis switch in cancer
cells treated with IR and erlotinib. In conclusion, we identify EGFR as a molecular target to overcome a
novel mechanism of radioresistance in KRAS-mutant tumor cells, which stands in contrast to the unresponsiveness of KRAS-mutant cancers to EGFR-directed agents in monotherapy. Our ﬁndings may
reposition EGFR-targeted agents for combination with DSB-inducing therapies in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.

Introduction
Exposure of cellular DNA to ionizing radiation (IR) generates various types of damage (1). A dose of 1 Gy produces
20 to 40 DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in a mammalian
cell (1, 2). Unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs are the principal type of damage that may result in lethal chromosomal
aberrations and cell death, or radiobiologically termed "cell

inactivation," within 1 to 3 division cycles (reviewed in ref. 3).
Molecular targeted anticancer agents have been tested
extensively preclinically, and increasingly so in the clinic,
to enhance the cytotoxic effects of IR. Preclinical data
suggest that radiosensitization is frequently achieved by
interfering with DSB repair, thereby increasing the levels of
residual, unrepaired DSB (4–6). Unrepaired DSB may induce
cellular senescence or apoptosis, but the latter outcome is
generally more desirable as senescent cells remain viable
and can even escape senescence (7, 8).
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is difﬁcult to control
locally by IR due to the typically large tumor size at diagnosis
and the proximity to critical normal organs, which limit the
achievable dose of radiation (reviewed in ref. 9). Therefore,
radiation has been combined with radiosensitizing chemotherapeutics. However, this combination has yielded only
a modest survival beneﬁt and at the cost of signiﬁcant toxicity
in many patients. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
is a member of the erbB multigene family. Receptor activation
is associated with phosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine
kinase domain and recruitment of signaling molecules that
initiate the diverse signaling cascades that promote biologic
responses, including enhanced proliferation, cell survival, as
well as radiation resistance (reviewed in refs. 10, 11). As EGFR is
expressed in up to approximately 80% of NSCLC, it constitutes
a potentially important target in NSCLC therapy (12). Clinical

trials have sought to integrate EGFR-targeted monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) or selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
into the treatment of NSCLC to achieve radiosensitization,
with varying results (13–15). For NSCLC harboring wild-type
EGFR, it is increasingly appreciated that these agents should be
selected based on the molecular proﬁle of a given tumor rather
than administered to all patients (16). However, predictive
biomarkers of radiosensitization have been lacking.
The KRAS gene encodes a GTPase involved in relaying
signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Upon the
introduction of point mutations, most commonly at codons
12 and 13, the K-Ras protein becomes constitutively active
and acquires oncogenic properties. KRAS mutations are found
in approximately 30% of NSCLC (17) and are associated
with resistance to EGFR-targeted agents in monotherapy
as well as poor prognosis (18–21). In KRAS-mutant cells,
critical prosurvival and growth effector pathways are activated by K-Ras and consequently exhibit resistance to inhibition by TKIs such as erlotinib or mAbs such as cetuximab
(22, 23). There is also evidence that KRAS mutations confer
radioresistance, although this phenomenon is understudied
in NSCLC (24–26).
Large-scale screening of annotated cancer cell lines has
been successfully used to identify cell line subsets sensitive
to single-agent treatments and associated biomarkers
(27–30). There is a need to adapt such screening platforms
for the study of IR in conjunction with potentially radiosensitizing targeted compounds. We recently reported that
the radiosensitizing effects of erlotinib and cetuximab seen
in a short-term survival assay as used in screening platforms
correlate well with results of the standard clonogenic survival assay (6). The degree of radiosensitization for single
doses of IR was relatively small, i.e., 1.02 to 1.17 for shortterm survival and 1.15 to 1.46 for clonogenic survival,
consistent with data reported by others (6, 31, 32). However,
it is thought that a small radiosensitizing effect incurred
by a single dose of IR could be ampliﬁed when doses are
repeated (33), as would be the case during a several-week
clinical course of radiation consisting of 30 or more fractions of approximately 2 Gy each.
Here, we have carried out a screen of 40 human NSCLCderived cell lines using 2 Gy IR together with erlotinib
or cetuximab. We establish a surprising positive association between KRAS mutation and radiosensitization,
and we have determined that EGFR-dependent chromatin
condensation protects KRAS-mutant cancer cells against IR-induced DSB and premature senescence, thus revealing novel
therapeutic opportunities to treat KRAS-mutant cancers.

Johns Hopkins University, Balitmore, MD (34). The identity
of each of the cell lines in the panel had been tested as
described previously (6), and additional cell line authentication was performed by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. No cell line was
ever treated for mycoplasma and all lines tested mycoplasma
free before the experiments (MycoAlert; Lonza). NCI-H1703
cells harboring wild-type KRAS were transfected with a pBABEPuro vector encoding KRAS G12V or an empty control (kindly
provided by Dr. David Barbie, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA). Stably transfected clones were selected with
2 mg/mL puromycin (Sigma; P9620) and maintained at
1 mg/mL puromycin. Short hairpin RNA KRAS transfection
of A549 cells was performed as described previously (35).
For three-dimensional culture of tumor spheres, approximately 5,000 cells per well were grown in low-binding 96-well
plates (Thermo; 145399) using serum-free medium composed
of Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Sigma-Aldrich), basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor, and EGF (20 ng/mL each; SigmaAldrich), and B27 supplement (Life Technologies).
Xenograft experiments
A549 xenografts were grown and treated as described previously (6).
Treatments
Irradiation as well as treatments with erlotinib and cetuximab was described previously (6). NU7026 (EMD Millipore;
260961), hesperadin (Selleck; S1529), G€
o6976 LC Laboratories; G-6203), and AZD6244 (Selleck; S1008) were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and chloroquine (Sigma; C6628)
was dissolved in double distilled water. Drugs were added
1 hour before irradiation and maintained for the duration
of each experiment. Chaetocin (Cayman; CAS 28097) and Ro32-0432 (Merck; 557525) were dissolved in DMSO and incubated with cells for 1 hour before collecting for cell lysates.
Thymidine (Sigma; T1895) was dissolved in PBS, and used at
2.5 mmol/L concentration 16 hours before and 8 hours after
releasing cells in normal cell culture medium.
Cell proliferation and survival assays
Clonogenic survival assays were performed as previously
published (36). Determination of cell numbers 72 hours after
irradiation with 2 Gy was performed by manual counting or by
using a ﬂuorescent nucleic acid stain Syto60 as described
(30). For analyzing tumor spheres, the CellTiter-Glo (CTG)
luminescence assay was used (Promega). CTG reagents were
applied to lysed spheres 3 days after irradiation following
the manufacturer's protocol. Signals were read by the MultiLabel reader, 2140 Envision (Perkin Elmer).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Cell lines were selected from a previously published panel
located in the Center for Molecular Therapeutics at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA (30), except for A549
and Calu-6, which were purchased directly from American
Type Culture Collection, and DLD1 (KRAS G13D/wt) and
DWT7 (del/wt), which were kind gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein,

EGFR Protects KRAS-Mutant Cells

Senescence staining
Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining was performed using a commercial kit (Cell Signaling Technology;
#9860) as described previously (6).
Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay
DSBs were measured at 15 minutes after 2 Gy irradiation by
neutral single-cell gel electrophoresis as described previously (37).
Flow cytometry
Cell-cycle distribution analysis and quantiﬁcation of
g-H2AX signal were performed using ﬂow cytometry as described previously (6).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Staining and visualization of g-H2AX and 53BP1 foci were
performed as described (38). For visualization of EGFR and
trimethyl (Lys9)-phospho (Ser10)-Histone H3 (EMD Millipore;
05-809) expression in vitro and in vivo, the same protocol was
used. Following ﬁxing and permeabilization, cells were incubated with g-H2AX and 53BP1 (Abcam; ab22551 and ab21083,
respectively), EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-03) followed by incubation with an Alexa-488–conjugated secondary
antibody (A11029; Invitrogen). All slides were counterstained
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and examined by
ﬂuorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51).
Western blotting
Proteins in whole-cell lysates from exponentially growing
cell cultures were detected using standard methods. Speciﬁc
antibodies against p-EGFR (Tyr992; Invitrogen; 40-8250), trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), dimethylated
histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2), monomethylated histone H3
lysine 9 (H3K9me), acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac),
phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph), total
histone H3, total-PKCa, and p21 (Abcam; ab88988, ab1220,
ab9045, ab12179, ab47297, ab1791, ab23276, and ab18209,
respectively), trimethyl (Lys9)-phospho (Ser10)-Histone H3
(EMD Millipore; 05-809), phospho-PKC (pan) and Bcl-2 (Cell
Signaling Technology; #9371 and #2876), LC3 (MBL; M186-3),
caspase-3 (Calbiochem; #235412) and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich;
A5441), and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Protein bands
were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Invitrogen) followed by autoradiography.
Transmission electron microscopy
Cells were treated by erlotinib for 1 hour and ﬁxed
using standard methods, and transmission electron microscopy was carried out at the MGH Microscopy Core, Program in Membrane Biology. (http://www.partners.org/

Results
Radiosensitization of cancer cells by EGFR-directed
agents is dependent on KRAS mutation
To identify a subset of NSCLC that can be radiosensitized
by targeting EGFR, we used a panel of 40 annotated NSCLC

www.aacrjournals.org

cell lines resistant to erlotinib alone (30). Cells were subjected to a clinically relevant dose of IR, 2 Gy, with or without
erlotinib or cetuximab treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The number of persisting cells was determined at 72 hours
after IR, as described (6). The extent of drug-induced radiosensitization relative to the effect of IR alone was expressed
as SRF2Gy (short-term radiosensitization factor at 2 Gy;
Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Erlotinib and cetuximab caused radiosensitization with
mean SRF2Gy values of 1.10 and 1.13 in 40% and 48% of
NSCLC cell lines, respectively (Fig. 1A; Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Strikingly, among the top 11 cell lines displaying
the greatest radiosensitization by both EGFR-directed
agents, eight harbored a mutation in KRAS, even though
all cell lines are resistant to erlotinib alone (fraction of
cells, >0.5; Supplementary Fig. S1C). When correlating
KRAS status with SRF2Gy for all cell lines in the panel, we
found a statistically signiﬁcant increase in mean SRF2Gy in
mutant compared with wild-type cell lines for either drug
(P < 0.01; Fig. 1B). Genetic manipulation of KRAS in isogenic NSCLC pairs and a colorectal cancer pair (using
mutant KRAS overexpression, knockdown, or allelic deletion (Supplementary Fig. S1D; 35) produced similar results
(Fig. 1C). Mutant KRAS-speciﬁc radiosensitization was
even enhanced when drug incubation time before irradiation was extended (Supplementary Fig. S1E). As a conﬁrmation of the 72-hour assay, erlotinib radiosensitized
KRAS-mutant but not wild-type NSCLC cells in a clonogenic
survival assay (P < 0.01; Fig. 1D), which correlates with
EGFR TKI-mediated radiosensitization of KRAS-mutant
A549 xenografts (39). Similarly, radiosensitization was
seen in KRAS-mutant but not wild-type tumor spheres
(Supplementary Fig. S1F).
EGFR suppresses the induction of DSB by promoting
chromatin condensation in KRAS-mutant cells
To elucidate the mechanisms of radiosensitization by
targeting EGFR, we ﬁrst examined the induction and removal
of DSB using the established DSB marker g-H2AX in irradiated KRAS-mutant A549 cells similar to previous studies
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2A; refs. 5, 40). At 30 minutes
after irradiation with 1 Gy, EGFR inhibition by cetuximab or
erlotinib increased the percentage of cells with >20 foci per
nucleus by 1.2- to 1.6-fold (P ¼ 0.02). This change correlated
with an increase in the median number of IR-induced g-H2AX
foci per Gy per nucleus by 1.2- to 1.3-fold within 15 to 30
minutes of irradiation. The EGFR-dependent difference in
g-H2AX induction was conﬁrmed by another DSB marker,
53BP1, and single-cell gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the difference in DSB numbers at 30 minutes was not
due to a previously proposed effect of EGFR on non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ; 41), as (i) pharmacologic inhibition
of DNA-PKcs did not abrogate the difference (Fig. 2C), (ii)
EGFR inhibition did not affect nuclear translocation previously hypothesized to represent an EGFR function in NHEJ
(Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2B; 40), and (iii) EGFR activity
did not affect NHEJ frequencies in a GFP-based I-SceI reporter assay (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition, EGFR

inhibition was required before irradiation but not immediately afterwards (Fig. 2E). A remarkably consistent and
mutant KRAS-dependent increase in DSB upon EGFR inhibition was seen in several nonisogenic and isogenic comparisons, i.e., 1.2- to 1.5-fold difference (Fig. 2F).
We hypothesized that KRAS-mutant cells may harbor
more condensed chromatin than wild-type cells, making
them less susceptible to accumulate damage to their
DNA (42). We, therefore, characterized the impact of
erlotinib on chromatin structure using transmission electron microscopy in KRAS-mutant cells (Fig. 3A). EGFR
inhibition for 1 hour reduced the fraction of cells with a
high content of dense chromatin by 25%. Trimethylation of
lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) is a general marker of
dense chromatin, found in heterochromatin as well as
mitotic chromatin (43). Consistent with the electron
microscopy ﬁndings, EGFR inhibition led to a decrease in
the H3K9me3 signal both in vitro and in a xenograft
model (Fig. 3B–D). To demonstrate the dependence of
DSB induction on chromatin condensation, we pharmacologically inhibited histone methyltransferases (Fig. 3E).
The resulting repression of H3K9me3 completely abrogated the effect of EGFR inhibition on DSB induction. Together, these data suggest that EGFR-mediated chromatin
condensation protects mutant KRAS cells against IRinduced DSB.

EGFR and PKCa are coregulators of Aurora B kinasemediated chromatin condensation in interphase
To identify the mechanism by which EGFR may modulate
H3K9me3, we ﬁrst determined the enzymatic activities of
histone methyltransferases speciﬁcally targeting H3K9 in
A549 cells, but there was no effect of EGFR on promoting
methyltransferase activity (Supplementary Fig. S3A). We
next asked whether EGFR suppresses H3K9 demethylase
activities. Although EGFR inhibition did not cause an
increase in dimethylation or monomethylation of H3K9,
we observed an unexpectedly reduced phosphorylation on
H3 serine 10 (p-H3S10; Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation at H3S10
promotes mitotic condensation through H3K9me3 and is
generally thought to be a marker of the G2 and M phases of
the cell cycle (43, 44). Erlotinib treatment reduced the
percentage of cells with colocalized p-H3S10 and H3K9me3
from 18.5% to 8.7% (Fig. 4B), and there was a pronounced
signal reduction in vivo as well (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Interestingly, the reduced costaining signal was almost
exclusively due to a decrease in the interphase-type, punctuate staining pattern that has been previously described
in G2-phase cells (Fig. 4B; ref. 43). To determine whether the
observed reduction was indeed speciﬁc for G2-phase cells
or could be detected in other phases of the cell cycle as well,
we performed a double thymidine block, which essentially
eliminated G2–M-phase cells (Fig. 4C). Under these

EGFR Protects KRAS-Mutant Cells

conditions, we continued to observe cells with a colocalized
H3K9me3 and p-H3S10 signal that was sensitive to erlotinib.
Aurora B kinase phosphorylates H3S10 to promote
mitotic condensation, but the existence of this modiﬁcation
outside of the G2–M-phase is unknown. Pharmacologic inhibition of Aurora B kinase abrogated not only mitotic
colocalization of p-H3S10 and H3K9me3 but also the interphase-type staining pattern (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Furthermore, consistent with the data in Fig. 4C, Aurora B
kinase inhibition increased the amount of IR-induced DSB
in G1 phase cells, with no additional effect of EGFR inhibition on the DSB signal (Fig. 4D). DSB induction resulting
from Aurora B kinase inhibition was more pronounced in
KRAS-mutant than in wild-type cells, with the latter effect
likely representing a modiﬁcation in mitotic cells (Fig. 4E).
We conclude that Aurora B kinase and EGFR promote a
mitosis-like chromatin condensation mechanism in a fraction of interphase KRAS-mutant cells, thereby suppressing
DSB induction.
Lastly, we wanted to identify the EGFR signaling pathway that promotes the inhibition of DSB induction. We,
therefore, screened KRAS-mutant A549 cells with a panel of
pharmacologic inhibitors directed at the key pathways
known to function downstream of EGFR (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). Only inhibition of protein kinase C alpha (PKCa)

www.aacrjournals.org

was found to affect DSB induction, and the effect was
epistatic with EGFR inhibition (Fig. 4F). The increase in
DSB induction by a PKCa inhibitor was abolished in cells in
which PKCa was depleted by RNA interference (Fig. 4G).
As predicted, PKCa inhibition reduced H3K9me3 levels
to a degree comparable with EGFR inhibition (Fig. 4H; Supplementary Fig. S3E). Analogous to erlotinib, PKCa inhibition repressed the colocalized p-H3S10 and H3K9me3
signal and correspondingly increased DSB induction in
NCI-H1703 cells expressing mutant KRAS, but not in isogenic wild-type cells (Fig. 4I; Supplementary Fig S3F).
A senescence-to-apoptosis switch in cells expressing
mutant K-Ras
In an isogenic model, KRAS wild-type cells were sensitive to
treatment with erlotinib alone (Supplementary Fig. S4A), with
the induction of premature cellular senescence accounting for
at least some of the effect (Fig. 5A). In contrast, erlotinibtreated KRAS-mutant cells were resistant to senescence induction. However, upon additional irradiation with 2 Gy, the
senescence response was reactivated (while IR alone did not
cause senescence; Fig. 5A). Consistent with our previous results
(6), MEK–ERK inhibition caused a small degree of senescence
in KRAS-mutant cells that could not explain all the effect of
erlotinib treatment (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4B).

autophagy may suppress apoptosis (45, 46). We inhibited
autophagy in KRAS-mutant cells by blocking autophagosome–lysosome fusion with chloroquine (Fig. 5C). Chloroquine
treatment combined with erlotinib but not by itself suppressed
p21 induction and senescence in response to IR (Fig. 5C and D).
In parallel, there was loss of BCL2 expression and induction of
apoptosis as evidenced by caspase-3 cleavage and an increased
sub-G1 fraction (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S4C). This senescence-to-apoptosis switch was mutant KRAS-speciﬁc (Fig. 5E).
As a result, the radiosensitizing effect of combined erlotinib
and chloroquine was observed only in the presence of KRAS
mutation and was particularly pronounced in KRAS-mutant
tumor spheres where the average SRF2Gy reached 2.0 (Fig. 5F;
Supplementary Figs. S4D and S4E).

However, combined inhibition of both MEK–ERK and PKCa
produced the full senescence phenotype.
Therapy-induced premature senescence is not necessarily a
desirable effect as senescent tumor cells remain viable and can
secrete growth factors. To convert senescence to apoptotic cell
death, we considered that KRAS-mutant cells have been

KRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene in NSCLC.
KRAS-mutant NSCLCs often display a poor prognosis and
radioresistance, and have proved refractory to most targeted
therapies, including EGFR-directed agents. These cancers thus
remain a major clinical challenge. Here, we report that in the
context of a DSB-producing treatment, EGFR assumes an
important role in promoting the survival of KRAS-mutant
cancer cells, thus rendering these cells susceptible to EGFR
inhibitors (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Interestingly, a previously understudied mechanism underlying the radiosensitizing effect of
EGFR inhibition involves the modulation of the number of DSB
generated by a given dose of IR, which is seen in all analyzed
KRAS-mutant cell lines (Fig. 2F). It is generally accepted that
the cytotoxic effects of IR result principally from damage to
DNA (3). The majority of DNA breaks from X-rays or photon
radiation as used in the clinic is caused by indirect action,
meaning IR-induced free radicals that diffuse far enough to
damage a DNA molecule. It can thus be postulated that regions
of decondensed, open chromatin would make the exposed
DNA helix more vulnerable to radiation ionizations, whereas
condensed regions would be relatively less susceptible to DNA
damage induction (42). Consistent with this concept, EGFR
inhibition loses its effect on DSB induction in the setting of
open chromatin (Fig. 3E).
Unexpectedly, the EGFR-mediated reduction of DSB induction was characterized by colocalized H3K9me3 and p-H3S10
(Fig. 4B), which is an established marker of mitotic chromatin
condensation during late G2 and mitosis. Interestingly, we not
only found that this chromatin mark is also present in the G1
phase in a subset of cells but also that Aurora B suppresses DSB
induction in G1 (Fig. 4C and D). It was previously shown that
among the key mitotic regulators, Aurora B is degraded by
the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ubiquitin ligase
at a relatively late stage and is still detectable in the G1 phase
(47). Our results suggest that Aurora B remains active in G1 to
maintain condensed chromatin in a fraction of cells, a process
that is coregulated by an EGFR–PKCa-dependent pathway,
thereby protecting KRAS-mutant cells against DSB through
most of the cell cycle (Fig. 4D).
What might be the purpose of enhanced chromatin condensation in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells? Oncogene-induced

such as KRAS (48). During carcinogenesis, oncogene-driven

IR, endogenous DSBs arise as byproducts of normal intracellular metabolism. The spontaneous rate of endogenous DSBs
may be as high as 50 DSBs per cell per cell cycle (49), and
conceivably could be even higher in cells with activated
oncogenes such as mutant KRAS that drive cells through
the cell cycle without sufﬁcient time for damage repair.
We observed that neither low doses of IR (2 Gy, causing 40–
80 DSB) nor EGFR inhibition alone induced senescence in
KRAS-mutant cells, but, unexpectedly, the combination of
these treatments did (Fig. 5A). These data support a model
in which KRAS-mutant cells use EGFR–PKCa for suppression
of a DSB-induced senescence response, which may be important during the process of carcinogenesis, yet represents a
therapeutic target.
Although there is currently great interest in exploiting
stress-induced premature senescence for anticancer therapy,
it is important to realize that senescent cells remain alive and
may even escape senescence (7). Interestingly, recent studies
have suggested that autophagy may be a potential promoter
or a precondition of stress-induced premature senescence
(50, 51). At the same time, autophagy may inhibit apoptosis
in tumor cells consistent with a cytoprotective role (46).
Consistent with these data, we discovered that autophagy
inhibition by chloroquine converts the senescence response

2832

Cancer Res; 74(10) May 15, 2014

to a more desirable apoptotic outcome (Fig. 5C–E). Importantly, the combination of EGFR TKI and chloroquine has been
already explored in the clinic and shows a favorable toxicity
proﬁle (52). Therefore, combining IR with EGFR-directed
therapy and an autophagy inhibitor such as chloroquine
may warrant clinical investigation in KRAS-mutant cancers.
In conclusion, our data challenge the current paradigm of
EGFR inhibitor resistance in KRAS-mutant cancers and, by
providing insight into the role of EGFR in chromatin modulation and senescence suppression, yield potential novel therapeutic opportunities.
