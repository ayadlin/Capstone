BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain are associated
with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: The authors tested the possibility that nucleotide sequencing may be poorly suited for detection of mutations in tumor samples and found that denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) was an efficient
and more sensitive method for screening. RESULTS: These results suggested that some reports based on standard
DNA sequencing techniques may have underestimated mutation rates. In the present report, the authors examined
the relationship between the presence and type of EGFR mutations detected by dHPLC and various clinicopathologic
features of NSCLC, including response to therapy with EGFR-TKI. Among 251 patients with advanced disease, 100
individuals received EGFR-TKI. Those whose tumors harbored a detectable EGFR kinase mutation were much more
likely to have a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with EGFR-TKI therapy than patients whose tumor contained no mutation (80% vs 35%; P ¼.001). Among the individual genotype subgroups, the frequency of a PR or SD
was significantly different between patients with an exon 19 deletion compared with those with no detectable mutation (86% vs 35%; P < .001). Furthermore, patients whose tumors expressed an exon 19 mutant EGFR isoform exhibited a trend toward better EGFR-TKI response (86% vs 67%; P ¼.171) and improved survival compared with patients
whose tumors expressed an exon 21 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings warrant confirmation in large prospective
trials and exploration of the biological mechanisms of the differences between mutation types. Cancer

The small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) gefitinib and erlotinib
have made a major impact on the treatment of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In initial clinical trials of
EGFR-TKI in NSCLC, although tumors in the vast majority of patients failed to respond, a minority showed dramatic tumor shrinkage accompanied by symptomatic improvement. Such responses were noted to be more common in East
Asians, in women, in nonsmokers, and in patients with adenocarcinomas, especially those with areas of bronchioalveolar
carcinoma.1-3 These observations suggested that there may be a molecular mechanism underlying the sensitivity to these
drugs, which would be present more frequently in these patients. This ultimately led to the sequencing of the EGFR gene
and the identification of EGFR mutations.4-6

Genetic alterations in 2 exons account for approximately 90% of the EGFR mutations reported to date in
lung adenocarcinomas. The first is a short in-frame deletion of 9 to 24 nucleotides in exon 19. The other is a point
mutation in exon 21 (2573T>G) that results in substitution of leucine by arginine at codon 858 (L858R).4-10
Other much less common mutations have also been
described in exons 18, 20, and 21.
A large number of retrospective and prospective
studies have confirmed the link between clinical characteristics associated with EGFR-TKI response and EGFR
mutations.11-20 The retrospective response rate to EGFRTKI treatment in mutation-positive cases is 77% (range
of 30%-100%, with most series reporting response rates
>60%), compared with 10% in mutation negative
patients. Prospective mutational studies have yielded
remarkably similar findings, despite the use of different
EGFR-TKI and the participation of patients from different ethnic populations.21-26 Collectively, they have demonstrated response rates of 62% to 82%. Interestingly,
emerging data suggest that specific EGFR genotypes may
be predictive of favorable outcomes, specifically that cases
with EGFR exon 19 deletions may have increased
response rate and survival with EGFR-TKI compared
with L858R cases.25,26 This is in contrast to the reported
natural history of such patients, where those with exon 19
deletions appear to have a shorter survival that those with
L858R.9
Several conceptual and technical issues may confound the correlative analysis of EGFR mutations and
response. First, the combination of infrequent mutations
in unselected NSCLC cohorts and common use of fineneedle aspirates for diagnosis that are often insufficient for
molecular analysis has resulted in relatively small numbers
of mutation-positive patients in most series, limiting the
statistical power of most US and European studies. Second, most retrospective studies include tumor samples
collected at initial diagnosis, whereas EGFR-TKI therapy
may have been administered after multiple courses of
chemotherapy. As such, additional mutations leading to
EGFR-TKI resistance may have arisen in the interim and
may account for some mutation-positive unresponsive
cases. Finally, technical differences in assessing EGFR
mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and the limited reliability of various mutation
detection approaches may explain differences in reported
mutation frequencies across studies. Our own group
tested the possibility that nucleotide sequencing may be

poorly suited for mutation screening of tumor samples
and found that denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) was an efficient and more sensitive
method for screening.27 These results suggested that some
previous reports using standard DNA sequencing techniques may have underestimated mutation rates.
In the present report, clinical specimens from
NSCLC patients were analyzed for EGFR mutations with
the aim of examining the relationship between the presence and type of EGFR mutations identified by dHPLC
and various clinicopathologic features of NSCLC, including response to therapy with EGFR-TKI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Clinical Chart Review
By using an electronic database maintained at the Division of Pulmonary Diseases of the Sir Mortimer B. DavisJewish General Hospital, all NSCLC patients with known
EGFR mutation status were identified. Variables recorded
included patient demographics (sex, disease stage, smoking status, histology, and the presence or absence of an
exon 19 deletion or exon 21 mutation), tumor response to
gefitinib or erlotinib, and survival outcomes. Staging was
performed using American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging criteria. Patients were categorized using standard
criteria, including former smokers, defined as patients
who had quit smoking at least 1 year before their diagnosis
of lung cancer, and never-smokers, defined as patients
who had smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Pack
years of smoking were calculated by multiplying the number of packs smoked per day by the number of years smoking. Histology was classified according to the World
Health Organization classification system. Criteria used
for classifying response and progression included the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, radiographs, and computed tomography or bone scans. The
study protocol was approved by our institutional review
board.
Analysis of EGFR Mutations
Patients and genomic DNA

NSCLC tissues were obtained through protocols
approved by our institutional review board. Cases
included surgically resected specimens and samples of
bronchoscopic and computed tomography-guided needle
biopsies. All clinical samples were subjected to dHPLC
analyses (Fig. 1). A LightCycler assay was used to confirm
the presence of the L858R mutation in some specimens.

DNA extraction and PCR

Paraffin-embedded tumor samples were cut into 10
sections measuring 8 to 10 lm thick and put into Eppendorf tubes. One milliliter of toluene was added, and the
samples were incubated at 37 C for 15 minutes, followed
by a 5-minute centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at room temperature. The supernatant fluid was decanted, and this was
followed by another wash with 1 mL of toluene. Samples
were then washed twice with 1 mL of 100% ethanol and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. One hundred

eighty microliters of ATL buffer (QIAGEN, Valencia,
Calif) was added after air-drying the samples at 55 C for
30 minutes. QIAGEN’s Tissue Protocol was then used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using reagents
from the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
Frozen tissue samples were ground in cell lysis
buffer, and 20 lL of proteinase K was added per milliliter
of sample. DNA was extracted according to the Genomic
DNA Isolation Kit (Puregene, Gentra Systems, Plymouth, Minn).

PCR reactions were set up as follows: 5 lL of 5
reaction buffer containing 15 mM MgCl2 and 200 nmol
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (QIAGEN), 0.5 lL each
of 20 lM EGFR exon 19 forward and reverse primers
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), 0.25 lL of 5U/lL Platinum
Taq (Invitrogen), 2 lL of genomic DNA, and sterile
water up to 25 lL. A pre-PCR denaturing step was carried
out at 95 C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 94 C
for 20 seconds, 60 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for 60 seconds. A final elongation was performed at 72 C for
10 minutes, followed by an indefinite hold at 5 C. A 1%
agarose check gel was run to confirm amplification.
Denaturing dHPLC

The dHPLC system used was a Transgenomic Wave
Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System (Transgenomic,
Omaha, Neb). dHPLC was carried out on the WAVE system with a DNASep column (Transgenomic). The
mobile phases comprised 0.05% acetonitrile in 0.1 M
triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) (eluent A) and 25%
acetonitrile in 0.1 M TEAA (eluent B). To detect heteroduplices for exon 21, amplified products were subjected
to an additional 3-minute, 95 C denaturing step followed
by gradual reannealing from 95 to 65 C over a period of
30 minutes. The PCR-amplified exon 19 products were
analyzed without any further treatment. Exon 19 and 21
products were then eluted at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min.
The start- and endpoints of the gradient by mixing eluents
A and B and the temperature required for successful resolution of heteroduplex molecules were adjusted by using
an algorithm provided with WAVEmaker system control
software version 4.1.42 (Transgenomic). Five microliters
of PCR products was injected for each run. The flow rate
was 0.9 mL/min, and the ultraviolet detector was set to
260 nm. Heterozygous profiles were identified by visual
inspection of the chromatograms on the basis of the
appearance of additional, earlier eluting peaks. Corresponding homozygous profiles show only 1 peak.
LightCycler EGFR L858R mutation assay

Primers and probes were designed using LCProbe
Design 1.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The
forward and reverse primer sequences for exon 21 of
EGFR were 50 -GTTTCAGGGCATGAACTAC-30 and
50 -CTGACCTAAAGCCACCTC-30 , respectively. The
sequences of the anchor and sensor probes were CTCTT
CCGCACCCAGCAGT-Fluo and LC-640-GGCCC
GCCCAAAATCTGT-P, respectively. The sensor probe
was complementary to the mutant species. Real-time

4312

PCR, followed by melting curve analysis, was performed
on a LightCycler 2.0 instrument using LightCycler Software 4.0 (Roche Diagnostics). Distinct melting temperatures were observed for each allele: 56 C for the wild type
allele and 66 C for the mutant allele.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were compared using Fisher exact
test or chi-square test when appropriate. Univariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the strength of association between mutation status
and factors such as sex, histology, and smoking status.
Tumor response was categorized based on interval computed tomography scans as complete response, partial
response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease
using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.
Association between tumor response and EGFR mutation
was investigated using Fisher exact test.
Overall survival was defined as the time elapsed
from the date of diagnosis of metastatic disease to the date
of death or the date of the last follow-up for patients alive
at the time of analysis. Overall survival curves were drawn
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences
among mutation and wild type groups were compared
using log-rank and Breslow tests.

RESULTS
Spectrum of Mutations in NSCLC Patients
Tumor specimens suitable for genetic analysis were available from 373 patients. The majority of tumors examined
(77%) were adenocarcinomas or bronchioalveolar carcinomas. Overall, 88 (24%) of the 373 patients evaluated
had activating mutations of EGFR; 64 patients exhibited
exon 19 deletions, and 24 exhibited exon 21 point mutations. No tumors had an activating mutation in >1 exon.
Of note, the clinical characteristics of our patients with
mutations were similar to those of patients in published
studies. The majority were female never-smokers with
adenocarcinoma pathology (Table 1). In a multivariate
analysis, smoking status, histology, and disease stage were
the only significant predictors for the presence of an
EGFR mutation (Table 2).

course. Of these, 40 (40%) had mutations of EGFR. No
patient had a complete response. Nine (23%) patients had
a PR as their best response and 23 (58%) had SD, for a
total disease control rate of 80%. These figures are lower
than those widely reported in the literature. Several factors
may have contributed to this observation in our mutated
cohort. First, our study was a retrospective analysis of
highly selected patients from a single institution treated in
a real-world environment in which clinical trial standards
were not applied. Second, this study included tumor samples collected at initial diagnosis, whereas EGFR-TKI
therapy was administered in many cases after multiple
courses of chemotherapy. The majority of our patients
(>80%) received EGFR-TKI in the second- or third-line

setting. As such, additional mutations leading to EGFRTKI resistance may have arisen in the interim and may
account for some mutation-positive unresponsive cases.
Finally, technical aspects in assessing EGFR mutations
may have impacted our results. The low response rate to
EGFR-TKI among mutation-positive patients raises the
possibility of false-positive labeling with the dHPLC
method. dHPLC can indeed give a false-positive screening
result. The majority of these are often the consequence of
overcautious scoring of dHPLC traces, as samples that
give a weak or atypical dHPLC trace are typically recorded
as positive, as is appropriate for a screening technique.
However, we do not believe that this is the case in our
study. Our own group previously reported on dHPLC
(the same assay used in this study) for detection of EGFR
mutations, showing that this method was an efficient and
more sensitive method for screening compared with
sequence analysis.27 In that study, all amplicons with
shifts detected by dHPLC were because of a DNA
sequence variation; the false-positive rate of dHPLC in
that analysis was 0%.
Response data for the various genotypes are listed in
Tables 3. Patients whose tumors harbored a detectable
EGFR kinase mutation were much more likely to have a
PR or SD with EGFR-TKI therapy than patients whose
tumor contained no mutation (80% vs 35%; P ¼ .001).

the exon 21 mutation subgroup compared with those
patients with no EGFR mutation (Fig. 2).

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier plots illustrate the impact of epidermal growth factor receptor genotype on overall survival.

Among the individual genotype subgroups, the frequency
of a PR or SD was significantly different between patients
with an exon 19 deletion mutation compared with those
with no detectable mutation (86 vs 35%; P < .001).
Patients whose tumors expressed an exon 19 mutant
EGFR isoform exhibited a nonsignificant trend toward
better EGFR-TKI response compared with patients
whose tumors expressed an exon 21 mutation (83% vs
67%; P ¼ .171). Those patients harboring an exon 21
mutation also appeared to respond better to EGFR-TKI
compared with wild type cases; however, because of the
small number of L858R cases, this difference did not
reach statistical significance. Furthermore, treatment with
EGFR-TKI was associated with a significant improvement in survival in all patients (18.3 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.4-23.2 vs 11.0; 95% CI, 8.1-13.9
months; Breslow test P ¼ .001).
Correlation of Tumor Genotype With Survival
Outcomes
On the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median overall
survival for the entire population was 15.6 months. Median survival for patients with advanced disease was 13.3

EGFR isoform exhibited a trend toward improved survival compared with patients whose tumors expressed an
exon 21 mutation or who had no detectable mutation
(19.9 vs 13.5 vs 14.5 months, respectively, P ¼ .55).
There was no significant difference in survival in favor of

DISCUSSION
In recent years, EGFR-TKI have assumed a prominent
role in the management of NSCLC alongside traditional
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. As a result, identification of predictive markers has become increasingly relevant in helping to identify those most likely to benefit
from these agents to maximize responses and spare
patients unnecessary toxicities. Although several important demographic and clinical factors are associated with
treatment response, EGFR somatic mutations have
emerged as the best predictors for EGFR-TKI sensitivity.
Direct sequencing analyses remain the current gold
standard for detecting EGFR mutations; however, these
methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, in comparison to newer assays such as dHPLC,
the sensitivity of sequencing was remarkably lower at
30%.28,29 Recently, our group demonstrated that dHPLC
is capable of extracting DNA from significantly smaller
tumor sample volumes than required for sequencing.27
This is particularly advantageous given that pathological
and molecular analysis must often be performed on less
than optimal tissue specimens. It is interesting to note
that in our study population, 26% of evaluable tissue
specimens were found to contain mutation, which is
higher than the 10% to 15% incidence typically reported
in the general North American and Western European
populations.5 It is possible that the enhanced sensitivity of
the dHPLC might have contributed to our higher mutation rate. The higher rate among our cohort may also be
attributable to an imbalance in the pathological type or
other patient characteristics.
In this series of NSCLC patients, the clinicopathologic profiles and outcomes of subjects who tested positive
for EGFR mutations were confirmed. Consistent with
previous reports, patients who are female, never-smokers,
and who have bronchioalveolar or adenocarcinoma
histology were significantly more likely to harbor mutations.30-32 Smoking status was the strongest predictor of
harboring an EGFR mutation.
For patients with advanced disease, EGFR mutations
were associated with an improved response to treatment
with EGFR-TKI agent (either in form of partial response
or disease stabilization). Also observed in our cohort was a
significant prolongation of survival in patients with EGFR
mutations compared with mutation-negative patients

after adjusting for age, diagnosis, and stage of disease.
This was a heterogeneous population, receiving many
treatment modalities and therapeutic regimens; therefore,
this finding suggests that EGFR mutation is a favorable
prognostic factor regardless of treatment. This conclusion
has been drawn by other investigators, including the
TRIBUTE investigators, where mutation-positive
patients had a prolonged survival regardless of treatment
arm.33 However, a prospective randomized study of an
EGFR-targeted agent compared with another systemic
treatment, in EGFR mutation-positive patients exclusively, is required to determine whether mutations may be
both prognostic and predictive of increased survival. The
recently reported IPASS (Iressa Pan-Asia Study) study has
provided us with 1 of the first opportunities to directly
compare chemotherapy to an EGFT-TKI and may help
clarify the prognostic and predictive relevance of EGFR
mutations. IPASS was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group study that assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of gefitinib versus doublet chemotherapy
(carboplatin and paclitaxel) as first-line treatment in a
clinically selected population of patients from Asia.
Results demonstrated superior progression-free survival
for gefitinib compared with doublet chemotherapy in the
overall population of clinically selected patients with
advanced NSCLC in Asia. The EGFR mutation status of a
patient’s tumor was a strong predictor of benefit with gefitinib or chemotherapy. Preplanned subgroup analyses
showed that progression-free survival was significantly
longer for gefitinib than doublet chemotherapy in patients
with EGFR mutation-positive tumors.34
The distribution of EGFR mutation types identified
in our cohort was consistent with other series, with most
mutations being in-frame exon 19 deletions and the
L858R point mutations in exon 21.20,25,26,35 These 2
most frequent EGFR mutations have been consistently
associated with EGFR-TKI responsiveness.36,37 Among
the individual genotype subgroups in our patient population, the frequency of a PR or SD was significantly higher
among patients with an exon 19 deletion mutation compared with those with exon 21 point mutations or no detectable mutation. Those patients harboring an exon 21
mutation also appeared to respond better to EGFR-TKI
compared with wild type cases; however, because of the
small number of L858R cases, this difference did not
reach statistical significance.
Although our analysis suggests that these 2 mutations are clinically different, it remains to be confirmed
whether these 2 mutations or other activating EGFR

Cancer

mutations have different clinical impact. In the largest retrospective cohort of patients from 2 US centers that followed EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients given EGFR-TKI
(gefitinib or erlotinib) as first- to third-line therapy, it was
observed that patients with exon 19 deletion had a significantly improved time to progression and overall survival
when compared with L858R patients.25,26 In both
reports, patients with exon 19 in-frame deletions had at
least double the progression-free and overall survival of
the group with L858R mutation. An explanation for the
differential response of the 2 EGFR mutation types to
EGFR-TKI remains elusive. The secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, results in the substitution of methionine
for threonine in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, disrupting normal binding of erlotinib.38 Jackman et al have
hypothesized that T790m mutations may occur more frequently with L585R mutations than with exon 19 deletions.25 In 2 Japanese prospective trials, the response rates
for both mutations were not significantly different. Inou
et al reported response rates of 67% and 86% for exon 19
deletions and L858R mutants, respectively.21 Asahina
et al reported response rates of 83% for exon 19 deletions
and 67% for L858R patients.39 The time to progression
in the latter trial is similar for both mutant cohorts. Other
studies have searched for disparities in the efficacy of
EGFR-TKI inhibition between mutation types but have
not yielded any definitive findings.
Our study is unique in its description of a large series
of patients undergoing EGFR mutation testing using
dHPLC as part of standard clinical practice, but it is subject to some limitations. One obvious disadvantage is our
sample size, which was limited to only 78 mutation-positive patients. We therefore lacked the power to obtain
definitive results from the examination of differences in
outcome between various subtypes of EGFR mutations.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that EGFR
mutation screening using dHPLC can be incorporated
into clinical care of NSCLC patients. We have confirmed
that individuals whose tumors harbored a detectable
EGFR kinase mutation were much more likely to have a
PR or SD with EGFR-TKI therapy than patients whose
tumor contained no mutation. Among the individual genotype subgroups, the frequency of PR or SD was significantly different between patients with an exon 19 deletion
mutation compared with those with exon 21 point mutations or no detectable mutation. Furthermore, patients
whose tumor expressed an exon 19 mutant EGFR isoform
exhibited a trend toward improved survival compared
with patients whose tumor expressed an exon 21
