Abstract
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been reported to have both
positive and negative effects on carcinogenesis. Here, we show
that the loss of c-Met signaling in hepatocytes enhanced rather
than suppressed the early stages of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. c-Met conditional knockout mice (c-metfl/fl , AlbCre+/ ;
MetLivKO) treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine developed significantly more and bigger tumors and with a shorter latency
compared with control (w/w, AlbCre+/ ; Cre-Ctrl) mice.
Accelerated tumor development was associated with increased
rate of cell proliferation and prolonged activation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. MetLivKO livers
treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine also displayed elevated
lipid peroxidation, decreased ratio of reduced glutathione to
oxidized glutathione, and up-regulation of superoxide dismutase 1 and heat shock protein 70, all consistent with increased
oxidative stress. Likewise, gene expression profiling done at 3
and 5 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment revealed
up-regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation and
stress responses in c-Met mutant livers. The negative effects of
c-Met deficiency were reversed by chronic p.o. administration
of antioxidant N–acetyl–L-cysteine. N–acetyl–L-cysteine blocked
the EGFR activation and reduced the N-nitrosodiethylamine–
initiated hepatocarcinogenesis to the levels of Cre-Ctrl mice.
These results argue that intact HGF/c-Met signaling is essential
for maintaining normal redox homeostasis in the liver and
has tumor suppressor effect(s) during the early stages of Nnitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis. [Cancer

Introduction
c-Met, the only known high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF; ref. 1, 2), was originally discovered as an
oncogene through its ability to induce transformation of NIH3T3
cells (3). The mature form of c-Met consists of a 50-kDa extracellular a chain and a 145-kDa transmembrane h chain containing a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain essential for downstream
signaling (4–6). The significance of the HGF/Met signaling pathway as a major regulator of hepatocyte proliferation, survival, and
motility is well established (7). Gene targeting experiments showed

that this signaling system is required during development. Mice
lacking either HGF (8) or c-Met (9) die at midgestation with multiple abnormalities including underdeveloped liver. In addition to
being of central importance for embryogenesis and tissue regeneration (10), there is strong evidence that HGF/c-Met signaling
controls invasive growth and metastasis in a variety of cancers,
including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; refs. 11–15).
Nevertheless, experimental mouse models of human liver cancer
have revealed that the net outcome of HGF/c-Met activation could
be both stimulation and inhibition of hepatocarcinogenesis. For
example, transgenic mice expressing HGF driven by the metallothionein promoter developed liver tumors, including HCC albeit
with a low frequency and a long latency (14). Alternatively, transgenic mice expressing HGF under control of the albumin promoter
did not form liver tumors (16), and transgenic coexpression with
HGF suppressed both c-Myc (17) and transforming growth factor-a
(TGF-a)–driven (18) hepatocarcinogenesis in double transgenic
mice. The cell culture studies have also shown opposite effects of
HGF/c-Met on cancer cell growth. Thus, HGF can either increase
cell survival (19–21) or inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in
a variety of cancer cell lines, including HCC and transformed rat
liver epithelial cell lines (22–24).
To mechanistically address a role for c-Met in liver carcinogenesis, we used a hepatocyte specific c-met conditional knockout
(MetLivKO) mouse model generated in our laboratory (25). In these
mice, exon 16 of c-met gene, which codes for a critical ATP-binding
site in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (26), was deleted in
postnatal hepatocytes by crossing the c-met fl/fl mice with AlbuminCre transgenic mice (27). Under physiologic conditions, MetLivKO
livers showed no obvious morphologic or functional abnormalities.
Nonetheless, c-Met deleted hepatocytes isolated from the intact
livers showed reduced cellular migration and increased adhesion
and stress fiber formation, consistent with the postulated roles
for HGF/c-Met signaling (15, 25). More significantly, a prolonged
absence of c-Met signaling in hepatocytes caused marked metabolic alterations and compensatory up-regulation of cytoprotective
transcription factors, such as nuclear factor [erythroid-derived–like
2 (Nrf2)] and its numerous downstream targets (15).
In this study, we used a well characterized model of
N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis to induce liver
tumor development (28). We found that rather than delay course of
tumor formation, loss of c-Met in hepatocytes greatly increased
susceptibility to N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The tumor promoting effect of c-Met deficiency was associated
with disruption of redox homeostasis and was prevented by a longterm feeding with the antioxidant N–acetyl–L-cysteine. These results
assign an important new function to c-Met in the maintenance of
tissue homeostasis and define c-Met signaling as an essential
component of the tumor-suppressing machinery in the adult liver.

Mice. MetLivKO (c-met , AlbCre ) mice were described previously
(25). Cre-Ctrl (w/w, AlbCre+/ ) or c-met fl/fl mice were used as controls as
indicated. All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free housing
and cared for in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
N-nitrosodiethylamine hepatocarcinogenesis and N–acetyl–L-cysteine
treatment. Mice received a single i.p. injection of 10 Ag/g body weight of
N-nitrosodiethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) at 14 days of age. Livers
were examined at 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 months. Additional cohorts of Cre-Ctrl
and MetlivKO mice were chronically subjected to p.o. administration of
80 mmol/L N–acetyl–L-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) beginning at mating. The
offspring continued to receive N–acetyl–L-cysteine-supplemented water
over the interval of 3 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine exposure at
2 weeks of age. There was no reduction in the number of pups per litter in either
genotype suggesting that N-acetyl-L-cysteine was not toxic during embryo and
postnatal development.
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL assay. Livers were
fixed in 10% neutral formalin o/n at 4jC. Paraffin sections (5 Am) were
stained with H&E for histology and quantification of hepatic lesions
graded as foci, adenomas, or carcinomas as defined previously (29). The
areas occupied by tumors were measured using ImageJ software (NIH).
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out by using the avidin-biotin
complex method staining kit (Vector Laboratories). Anti-Ki67 (clone TEC-3;
DakoCytomation) was used at 1:100 dilution. TUNEL staining was done
using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection kit (S7101;
Chemicon) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories).
Western blotting. Total and nuclear proteins were isolated from frozen
liver tissue with T-PER or NE-PER (Pierce Biotechnology) extraction
reagents, respectively, containing 1% Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Pierce Biotechnology), 100 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. One hundred micrograms of total protein or
25 Ag of nuclear protein measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay
kit (Pierce Biotechnology) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels
(Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen), and probed with commercially available antibodies (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). Membranes were incubated with the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody
and immunoreactive bands identified with ECL-Plus Western blotting
detection reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Equal loading was
assessed by probing the same membranes with actin Ab-5 antibody
(NeoMarker) or in specified cases staining the gel using GelCode Blue Stain
(Pierce Biotechnology).
RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver tissue with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture’s instructions.
Total RNA (2.0 Ag) was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using
oligo(dT) primers with the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for
reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR; Invitrogen). PCR was done using Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and the specific primers for a-fetoprotein
(AFP), EGFR, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; see
Supplementary Materials and Methods for primer sequences). PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining.
Genomic DNA isolation. Six focal lesions and 20 full blown HCCs with
corresponding surrounding liver tissues were isolated from frozen sections
by laser capture microdissection using a Leica LMD6000 (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) at 5 and 8 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment,
respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected areas using
REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich). PCR was done using
REDExtract-N-Amp PCR Reaction Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) and specific primers
for the c-met floxed and deleted alleles and cre recombinase (see Supplementary Materials and Methods for specific primer sequences). PCR
products were separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium
bromide staining.

Lipid peroxidation assay. Lipid peroxidation was assayed by the
production of thiobarbituric acid–reactive components using spectrophotometry as described by Buege and Aust (30).
Reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione determination by
high performance liquid chromatography. Reduced glutathione (GSH)
and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) content were determined by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described by Farris and
Reed (31) with some modifications. Briefly, frozen liver tissues were
collected in 1 mL of 10% perchloric acid (Sigma-Aldrich), sonicated, and
centrifuged at 5,000g for 5 min at 4jC. After removal of the supernatants,
100 mmol/L iodoacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.2 mmol/L m-cresol
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each sample and GSH/GSSG solution
standards, and the pH was adjusted to 9.0. Samples and standards were
incubated in the dark for 1 h followed by the addition of 1 mL of 1%
1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100% HPLC grade ethanol.
N-2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP; 100 AL) derivatives were injected into the loop
of the HPLC system (Waters) and separated on a 3-aminopropyl column
(5 Am; 4.6 mm  20 cm; Custom LC). Eluted N-DNP derivatives were
measured by UV detection at 365 nm.
Microarray analysis. For microarray analysis, total RNA was isolated from
snap-frozen whole liver samples using the CsCl gradient centrifugation
method as described previously (15). The mouse MEEBO library containing
38,467 oligonucleotides among them 30,125 constitutive genomic probes and
4,201 alternatively spliced probes was purchased from Illumina, whereas
the microarrays were manufactured in the Advanced Technology Center
of the National Cancer Institute. The cDNA synthesis, fluorescent labeling of
the samples, and array hybridization were done following the standard
procedures (15). Expression profiling was conducted on five animals from
each genotype per time point. Total RNA pooled from five wild-type B6/129
strain mouse livers was used as universal hybridization reference. All
experiments were done in duplicates following a dye-swapping design. Arrays
were scanned with a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Ltd.) in a
way to achieve optimal signal intensity at both channels with <1% saturated
spots. After excluding the invalid features, all arrays were normalized to the
50th percentile of the median signal intensity using the mAdb data analysis
suite.1 Unsupervised cluster analysis was done with the Cluster and TreeView
programs.2 The BRB ArrayTools V3.3.0 software package (Biometric Research
Branch, National Cancer Institute)3 was used for the supervised comparison.
Differentially expressed genes were selected using a univariate two-sample
t test (P < 0.001) with a random variance model (15). Functional classification
of the significant genes was based on the gene ontology annotations.4
Statistical analysis. In the remaining comparisons, statistical significance was determined with a Student’s t test. Results are presented as the
mean F SE, and differences were assumed significant at P < 0.05.

Results
c-Met deficiency promotes N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced
hepatocarcinogenesis. The kinetics of tumor development in
MetLivKO livers after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment was assessed
by three factors: incidence, size, and multiplicity. In the absence of
c-Met signaling in hepatocytes, tumor appeared more rapidly than in
Cre-Ctrl mice (Fig. 1). At 5 and 6 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine
treatment, 56% (5 of 9; P < 0.05) and 100% (9 of 9; P < 0.05) of
MetLivKO mice formed tumors versus 11% (1 of 9) and 44% (4 of 9)
of Cre-Ctrl mice, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, c-Met–deficient
livers displayed significantly larger lesions and produced more foci
and tumors than N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated Cre-Ctrl livers
(Fig. 1B–D). The tumor incidence in mice homozygous for a floxed

c-met fl/fl allele was lower compared with Cre-Ctrl or c-Met–deficient
mice at 8 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment (80% versus
100%) in agreement with the known genotoxic effects of Crerecombinase (32, 33).
Mice of both genotypes developed similar histologic alterations.
The predominant tumor phenotype was AFP-positive basophilic
cell type typical for N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis. MetLivKO mice showed an earlier and stronger

up-regulation of AFP consistent with a more rapid and extensive
tumor growth (Fig. 2A–B).
Previously, we have shown that complete deletion of the c-met
floxed–targeted allele in hepatocytes by Cre-recombinase occurs
by 6 weeks of age (25). Since we injected mice with N-nitrosodiethylamine at 2 weeks postnatally, there was a possibility
that tumors in c-Met conditionally knockout livers could have
developed from c-Met–expressing hepatocytes. We therefore

N-nitrosodiethylamine–Induced HCC in c-Met Knockout Mice

genotyped both early focal lesions and full blown HCC
developed in MetLivKO at 5 and 8 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment. PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted
from six laser-microdissected focal lesions and 20 HCC showed
the presence of the c-met deletion-specific allele (650 bp;
Fig. 2C). These results show that loss of the c-Met function in
hepatocytes has contributed to the earlier tumor onset in
MetLivKO mice.
MetLivKO tumors display enhanced cell proliferation during
early stages of N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Next, we examined whether deregulation of proliferation or
apoptosis caused the faster tumor growth in c-Met–deficient livers.
There was no significant difference in the apoptotic index between
control and mutant livers at 5 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine
treatment. In contrast, c-Met–deficient tumors showed a consider-

able increase in the number of proliferating cells. The labeling index,
as assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, was consistently higher
in MetLivKO tumors at 5 and 6 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine
(Fig. 3A–B). However, at the advanced tumor stage (8 months after
N-nitrosodiethylamine), the growth rate was comparable in both
genotypes, suggesting that the loss of c-Met function was more
critical for the early stages of tumor development.
The high rate of cell proliferation in MetLivKO livers coincided
with the activation of EGFR signaling, another key regulator of liver
mitogenesis and tumorigenesis (34, 35). Immunoblot analysis using
phosphor-specific antibodies revealed an increase in both basal
and N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced levels of EGFR phosphorylation. This correlated with a strong and sustained activation of
EGFR downstream targets, p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein
kinase and protein kinase C a/hII (Fig. 3C).

Disregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation and
stress responses in MetLivKO livers by microarray analysis.
To further screen for the alterations caused by c-met gene disruption, we did gene expression profile analysis of N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated MetLivKO and Cre-Ctrl livers. Supervised
class comparison using a two-sample t test identified 57 and 317
differentially expressed genes at 3 and 5 months after Nnitrosodiethylamine treatment, respectively (P < 0.001; Fig. 3D;
Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with the higher rate of cell
proliferation in MetLivKO tumors (Fig. 3A), we found overexpression of several cell cycle–associated genes, including dual
specific phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) and components of the NADH
dehydrogenase a complex (Ndufa7, Nodufa12). In addition, functional analysis based on gene ontology classification showed
overrepresentation of the ribosomal protein cluster (P < 0.00002;
observed/expected ratio, O/E = 6.1) in mice lacking c-met gene in
hepatocytes (Table 1).
Remarkably, the most prominent effect of c-Met deficiency
was sustained misregulation of various oxidative stress response
genes. At 3 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine administration,
many genes encoding the metabolic enzymes located in the
endoplasmic reticulum (P < 00093, O/E = 3.73; Table 1) were
invariably up-regulated. Among these were cytochrome P450
oxidases (Cyp3a13, Cyp3a44, Cyp4f16, Cyp2d13), the microsomal
cytochrome (Cyb5a), and the glutamine synthesis enzymes
asparagine synthase (Asns) and ornithine aminotransferase (Oat).
Members of this class could contribute to the enhanced production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The metabolic alterations persisted at the 5 months time point. In addition, the 70-kDa heat
shock protein 1B (Hspa1b), the 60-kDa Hspd1, the glutathione
S-transferase mu 2 (Gstm2), and peroxiredoxin 4 (Prdx4) were

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

found to be significantly more abundant in the c-Met conditional
knockout livers (P < 0.001).
Increased oxidative stress in N-nitrosodiethylamine–treated
MetLivKO livers. To substantiate the microarray data, we
measured the redox status in N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated
MetLivKO and control livers. The content of malondialdehyde, the
major aldehyde end product of membrane lipid peroxidation, was
significantly higher in MetLivKO than in Cre-Ctrl livers at
5 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment (Fig. 4A). Concomitantly, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione was
decreased in MetLivKO livers (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we found
increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the untreated c-Met–
deficient livers (Fig. 4C). The transcription factor Nrf2 regulates
the basal and inducible expression of numerous antioxidant
and detoxifying genes and is activated by endogenous products
of oxidative stress including 4-hydroxynonenal (36). Consistent with
this and microarray data, the protein levels of Hsp70 and
antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) were increased
in MetLivKO livers (Fig. 4D). Together, these data suggest that the
lack of c-Met function in hepatocytes increased oxidative stress.
Antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cystein reversed the promoting effect
of c-Met deficiency on N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis. To determine whether an increase in ROS may
account for acceleration of N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated hepatocarcinogenesis, we studied the chemopreventive effects of a
potent antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. We chose N-acetyl-L-cysteine
because it can compensate for reduced GSH levels by increasing
cysteine pool or acting directly as ROS scavenger, and it has been
shown to be effective in suppression of oxidative and genotoxic
damage by chemical carcinogens in vivo (37). Chronic supplementation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine–containing water for 3 months

induced no obvious toxicity as evidenced by clinical observations
and gross pathology at necroscopy. There were no significant
differences in the food intake as well as the liver/body weight ratios
at the end of the study compared with mice receiving normal diet
(data not shown).
Strikingly, p.o. N-acetyl-L-cysteine administration slowed down
the N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated tumor growth in c-Met–
deficient livers without affecting Cre-Ctrl hepatocarcinogenesis
(Fig. 5A and B). At 3 months, the average size of focal lesions in
MetLivKO mice was reduced >3-fold and reached the levels
found in Cre-Ctrl mice. Dietary N-acetyl-L-cysteine also decreased the multiplicity of focal lesions in c-Met–deficient livers
by 1.8-fold (P = 0.02) although not to the same extent as focus
size (P = 0.052). Retardation of tumor growth was associated
with a strong decrease in the levels of EGFR phosphorylation
(Fig. 5C). Thus, the chronic administration of the antioxidant
N-acetyl-L-cysteine reversed the c-Met / phenotype and defined
ROS as a key mediator of the increased susceptibility to Nnitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocracinogenesis in MetLivKO
mice.

Discussion
In the present study, we show that hepatocyte-specific deletion
of c-met fl/fl targeted allele with the Alb-Cre recombinase transgene
had a profound effect on liver biology and dramatically increased
the susceptibility to N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis. In the absence of intact HGF/c-Met signaling, tumors
developed earlier were bigger and more numerous than in Cre-Ctrl
mice.

Interestingly, the loss of c-Met conferred growth advantage to
N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated cells at the early, rather than late,
stages of hepatocracinogenesis, suggesting that the effects of c-met
gene disruption may vary depending on the stage of carcinogenesis
(Figs. 1 and 3A). Previous findings support the critical role for HGF/
c-Met signaling at the initiation stage. Thus, administration of HGF
caused inhibition of cell proliferation in the preneoplastic lesions
positive for glutathione S-transferase placental form in the rat
model of N-nitrosodiethylamine hepatocarcinogenesis (38) while
stimulating hepatic DNA synthesis in normal and partially
hepatectomized rats (39). Consistent with this, we and others has
recently shown that c-Met is required for normal liver regeneration (25, 40, 41). Together, the data support the idea that HGF may
elicit the opposing proliferative responses in normal and transformed cells of the same origin (38) and functions to suppress
tumor formation by restricting the proliferation of initiated cells
during the early stages of N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
There were no apparent differences in apoptosis between c-Met
mutant and control tumors implying that disregulation of proliferation is principally responsible for the earlier tumor onset in
MetLivKO mice. The increased rate of cell division was associated
with the early and enhanced activation of EGFR signaling
pathway. EGFR, also known as ERBB1 or HER1, is one of the major
regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, which belongs to the ErbB
family of transmembrane receptors tyrosine kinases (34). EGF/
EGFR pathway has a strong stimulatory effect on hepatoma growth
and is frequently overexpressed in human HCC, particular at the
more aggressive stage (35). Although the mechanisms underlying increased EGFR signaling may differ, EGFR up-regulation in

c-Met–deficient tumors might be caused by increased ROS production (42, 43).
Indeed, our data show that the loss of a functional c-Met in
hepatocytes promoted a state of chronic oxidative stress.
MetLivKO livers displayed increased oxidative damage to lipid,
as well as DNA5 and reduced levels of GSH. We also found
up-regulation of a number of the antioxidant genes, including
Sod1 and Hsp70 (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S1) as a compensatory response to ROS exposure. Thus, Hsp70 has been shown
to be induced in parallel with a decrease in glutathione content
(44) and to provide protection against hydrogen peroxides (45).
Up-regulation of Hsp70 has been also found in a c-Myc/TGF-a
transgenic model of liver cancer in association with increased
ROS production (46, 47). Significantly, intact c-Met–deficient
livers exhibited elevated nuclear levels of Nrf2, a key transcription
factor protecting against oxidative and xenobiotic stress (Fig. 4D;
ref. 36). Previously, a profound misregulation of Nrf2 and its
numerous target genes related to stress responses or glutathione
metabolism has been identified as a part of c-Met–dependent gene
expression signature in our microarray study of cultured hepatocytes (15). Remarkably, lack of the intact c-Met signaling not
only abolished transcriptional activation of the early response,
cytoskeletal, and cell motility–related genes in response to
recombinant HGF treatment, but also led to long standing
metabolic alterations. Multiple genes responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis or involved in oxidative stress responses
showed constitutively higher level of expression in the c-Met–
deficient hepatocytes. Collectively, these results argue that
constitutive overexpression of antioxidant genes and phase II
detoxification enzyme genes in c-Met–deficient livers may be
attributable to a long-term adaptation to prooxidative microenvironment. Nonetheless, the up-regulation of cytoprotective genes
in MetLivKO livers may sustain the tolerance to oxidative stress
only under normal conditions but fails to shield from an additional oxidative load caused by N-nitrosodiethylamine exposure
(48, 49).
In support of this contention, the prooxidative effects of c-Met
deficiency were rescued by an oral administration of the thiolcontaining antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Chronic dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-L-cystein slowed down the growth
of N-nitrosodiethylamine–initiated focal lesions in MetLivKO
livers and reduced hepatocarcinogenesis to the levels of Crecontrol livers (Fig. 5). In contrast, the same intake of N-acetyl-Lcysteine did not have an effect in Cre-Ctrl mice in agreement
with the previous findings in N-nitrosodiethylamine–exposed
C3H mice (50). The antitumor effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine was
associated with inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting
that activation of alternative signaling pathways evoked by
oxidative stress, such as EGFR, may contribute to hepatic
oncogenesis. N-acetyl-L-cysteine–sensitive suppression of oxidation-mediated carcinogenesis has been described in other mouse
models of genetic deficiencies, causing increased ROS production and/or compromised antioxidant defense. Thus, N-acetyl-Lcysteine treatment reversed the oxidative DNA damage and the
frequency of DNA deletions in Atm (51) as well as in Trp53
knockout mice (52). Likewise, N-acetyl-L-cysteine suppressed
the compensatory cell proliferation and prevented excessive

N-nitrosodiethylamine–Induced HCC in c-Met Knockout Mice

N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis in IKKhdeficient mice by blocking ROS production and prolonged
c-Jun-NH2-kinase activation (53). The chemopreventive effects
of N-acetyl-L-cysteine lend a strong support to the assumption
that the conditional deletion of c-Met in hepatocytes creates
a chronic state of oxidative stress whereby contributing to acceleration of N-nitrosodiethylamine–induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
In conclusion, this study is the first to report that HGF/c-Met
signaling possesses tumor suppressive properties by controlling
intracellular redox state and restricting the proliferation of initiated
cells. These unexpected findings of tumor-promoting effects of
