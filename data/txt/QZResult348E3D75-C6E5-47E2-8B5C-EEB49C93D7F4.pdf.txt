Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Elevated activity of the MAPK signaling cascade is found in the majority of human melanomas
and is known to regulate proliferation, survival, and invasion. Current targeted therapies focus on
decreasing the activity of this pathway; however, we do not fully understand how these therapies
impact tumor biology, especially given that melanoma is a heterogeneous disease. Using a threedimensional (3D), collagen-embedded spheroid melanoma model, we observed that MEK and
BRAF inhibitors can increase the invasive potential of approximately 20% of human melanoma
cell lines. The invasive cell lines displayed increased receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and
activation of the Src/FAK/STAT3 signaling axis, also associated with increased cell-to-cell
adhesion and cadherin engagement following MEK inhibition. Targeting various RTKs, Src, FAK,
and STAT3 with small molecule inhibitors in combination with a MEK inhibitor prevented the
invasive phenotype, but only STAT3 inhibition caused cell death in the 3D context. We further
show that STAT3 signaling is induced in BRAF-inhibitor resistant cells. Our findings suggest that
MEK and BRAF inhibitors can induce STAT3 signaling, causing potential adverse effects such as
increased invasion. We also provide the rationale for the combined targeting of the MAPK
pathway along with inhibitors of RTKs, SRC, or STAT3 to counteract STAT3-mediated resistance
phenotypes.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Melanoma arises from the transformation of melanocytes which have accumulated
mutations in growth regulating genes and display increased levels of autocrine/paracrine
growth factors; this eventually leads to their uncontrolled proliferation, survival, and
dissemination (1). Contributing to this transformation, the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway becomes constitutively activated in the majority of melanomas, most
notably in tumors harboring activating RAS and RAF mutations (2). Targeting the MAPK
pathway thus became a valid anti-melanoma therapeutic strategy, and current trials using
RAF-selective inhibitors for patients with BRAFV600E-positive tumors are proof of the
potential to treat tumors, even advanced metastatic disease (3–6). Therapeutic challenges
arise however, in the form of acquired resistance in initially responsive patients, or through
intrinsic resistance as shown by tumors that do not respond or even adopt more aggressive
phenotypes (5, 7, 8). Mechanisms conferring resistance to RAF inhibitors are numerous but
the MAPK pathway frequently becomes reactivated despite the continued presence of
inhibitors designed to block its activity (9–13). In addition, other pathways and effectors
appear to become engaged such as the PI3K/Akt pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) such as IGFR, PDGFRβ, or the HGF receptor (9, 14–16). Secondary genetic
modifications were also shown to occur, such as amplifications of COT, mutations such as
MEK1 (C121S), as well as RAS mutations (14, 17, 18).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Unlike RAF-selective inhibitors, MEK inhibitors downregulate MEK and ERK activity in
most cells, irrespective of RAF mutation status, and can be used for a wider patient
population (19, 20). However, MEK inhibitor clinical success as single agents has often
been limited by toxicity and the response rate for mutant-BRAF melanoma was shown to be
lower than that for RAF inhibitors (reviewed in (21)). Their use is also challenged by the
fact that MEK inhibitor response does not always correlate with mutation or phosphoprotein markers associated with BRAF, MEK, RAS, or PI3K activity, suggesting the need to
rely on transcriptional pathway signatures or discover new predictive targets (20). The
development of novel and more potent MEK inhibitors such as trametinib could allow MEK
to resurface as an exciting clinical target, especially for mutant BRAF melanomas where
improved survival was recently observed (22); however, their potential and drawbacks are
still under investigation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While single agents BRAF and MEK inhibitors have shown limitations, their combination
has been proposed to obtain sustained MAPK pathway inhibition. However, studies already
predict resistance occurring following this treatment strategy (23). Alternatively, the
combination of a MAPK pathway inhibitor and that of an agent targeting a different
pathway, such as PI3K, could provide more effective results (9, 24–27). Given that
melanoma is a complex and heterogeneous disease comprised of genetically and biologically
diverse cell types, we anticipate that not all melanomas will respond to the same extent to a
given treatment strategy and alternative therapies and targets must be available to curb
disease progress.
In this study, we explore the intrinsic resistance mechanisms of metastatic melanomas
against MEK inhibition by interrogating a panel of genetically diverse human melanoma cell
lines. We observed that MEK inhibition (by UO126 and AZD6244) increased the invasion
potential of a cohort of human melanoma cell lines in a variety of models including skin
reconstructs. MEK inhibition in this cohort of melanomas is associated with increased RTK
activity and the activation of the STAT3 pathway. We further show that downregulation of
STAT3 activity or upstream RTKs prevent the invasive phenotype. Finally, we observed
that invasion and STAT3 pathway activation is a hallmark of BRAF inhibitor-resistant
melanoma cell lines.

RESULTS
MEK inhibition causes increased migration/invasion of melanoma cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We investigated the effects of MEK inhibition in multiple melanoma cell lines, using the
MEK inhibitors UO126 and AZD6244, in a collagen-embedded spheroid assay that mimics
the three-dimensional (3D) skin tissue microenvironment (24). Following 72 h treatment
with UO126 or AZD6244, we observed that 4/20 (20%) metastatic melanoma cell lines
tested displayed significantly increased invasion (Figure 1A, 1B; Suppl. Figure 1A), while
spheroid size was not greatly affected. MEK inhibition however, reduced invasion and
spheroid size in the non-metastatic cell lines WM35 and WM793 (Figure 1C), in agreement
with previous work indicating their sensitivity to MEK inhibitors (24). The BRAF and
NRAS mutation status of each cell line did not predict the increased invasion and MEK
mutations were not identified to contribute to such a phenotype (Table 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further conducted a transwell migration/invasion assay through a layer of collagen and
confirmed the increased migration potential of melanoma cells as single cell entities
(Figures 1D, 1E). Invasion was increased at least 3 fold for all treated cell lines compared to
untreated cells, and was significant for 2 out of 3 cell lines using this invasion assay;
however, this was likely due to the small number of invading cells in one cell line. To
ascertain that the invasive phenotype was also applicable to a more complex
microenvironment, we used a human skin reconstruct model featuring the co-culture of
multiple cell types including keratinocytes and fibroblasts. This skin-like model
demonstrated that MEK inhibitor-treated melanoma cells invade deeper into the dermis than
vehicle control-treated cells (Figures 1F, Suppl. Figure 1B, 1C). Even for metastatic cell
lines that are initially invasive such as 1205Lu, significant differences were observed in
UO126-treated skin reconstructs (Figure 1G). Our data indicate that the MEK inhibitorinduced invasive phenotype occurs in multiple invasion assays, in the presence of multiple
cell types, and in a human skin reconstruct model.
Receptor tyrosine kinases are activated upon MEK inhibition

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The potential of MEK inhibitors to halt invasion and spheroid growth in early stage
melanomas while activating spheroid invasion in some metastatic cell lines allowed us to
explore the distinct signaling mechanisms involved in melanoma intrinsic resistance to MEK
inhibition. We thus conducted a phospho-antibody array comparing a cell line that is
resistant and invades upon MEK inhibition (WM3918) versus a cell line that is sensitive to
MEK inhibition (WM793) (28), in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor (AZD6244).
We found that treatment with the MEK inhibitor for 72 h led to increased phosphorylation of
selected RTKs in both a sensitive and resistant cell line (Figure 2A). However, there were
distinct differences between the RTKs activated in the invasive cell line and the MEKinhibitor-sensitive cell line. Phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta
(PDGFRβ), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), insulin receptor, and insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) were selectively increased in WM3918. Interestingly,
IGFR and PDGFR have also been associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors in
melanoma (9, 25). We further confirmed the increased expression of IGFR and PDGFR
following UO126 treatment in the invasive melanoma cell lines (WM3918, 1205Lu)
compared to the MEK sensitive cell line WM793 (Figure 2B). The Erythropoietin-producing
hepatocellular kinase A2 (EphA2) was the only phospho-RTK downregulated in the MEKresistant and invasive cell line, while it was upregulated in the sensitive cell line.

Invasion following MEK inhibition is associated with activation of the Src/FAK/STAT3
signaling axis in 2D and 3D culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While our previous studies indicated the importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway for melanoma
survival following MAPK pathway inhibition (9, 24), we hypothesized that other pathways
are also activated and could contribute to the intrinsic resistance of melanoma cells to
MAPK inhibitors. For example, IGF-I/IGF-IR is able to mediate activation of the Signal
transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) in vitro and in vivo via the Janus
kinase (JAK) (29). Also, Src kinase activity can activate STAT3 preassembled with PDGFR
receptors (30), and STAT3 binding to FGFR was shown to be activated by receptor
amplification (31). The involvement of the Src/STAT3 axis in mediating growth and
survival of melanoma cells was previously demonstrated (32). We therefore examined the
activation of the Src, FAK, and STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cell lines that become
invasive following MEK inhibition. Figure 2C (and Suppl. Figure 2) data show that in 2D
culture, MEK inhibition can lead to the phosphorylation of Src, FAK, and STAT3, while
MEK and ERK phosphorylation is downregulated. Given that the invasive phenotype is
difficult to observe in 2D culture and signaling in 2D versus 3D cultures may be distinct, we
also confirmed STAT3 activation in cell extracts isolated from our 3D collagen-embedded
spheroid cultures (Figure 2C, lower panels). We further confirmed increased FAK
phosphorylation and STAT3 localization to the nucleus (indicating activation) upon MEK
inhibition by immunofluorescent imaging (Figure 2D). Interestingly, western blot analysis
indicates that whereas MEK inhibition upregulates Src/FAK/STAT3 activity and causes
increased invasion in metastasis-derived cell lines, MEK inhibition in early stage melanoma
cells (e.g. WM793) does not induce Src/FAK/STAT3 activity or invasion (Figure 2E). These
data suggest a potential role for STAT3 in melanoma cells’ intrinsic resistance to MEK
inhibition.
STAT3 phosphorylation increases in a MEK inhibitor dose- and time-dependent manner

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There is an inverse correlation between ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation in invasive cell
lines (exemplified by WM3918) as the MEK inhibitor UO126 dose increases (Figure 3A).
The MEK inhibitor AZD6244 also displays this correlation (Suppl. Figure 3). We also noted
an increase in STAT3 phosphorylation over time, most notably occurring at 12h postcompound addition (Figure 3B). While it was shown previously that cell-to-cell adhesion
alone can mediate STAT3 phosphorylation (33), MEK inhibitor addition could potentiate
this effect. To explore if increased cadherin engagement could be involved in UO126mediated STAT3 phosphorylation, especially given the altered cell morphology and
increased adhesion seen following compound addition (Figure 3C), we evaluated levels of
E- and N- cadherin following UO126 addition in WM3918 and WM983B cells. We
observed an increase in N-cadherin expression in a single cell line (WM983B) while Ecadherin levels remained even (Figure 3D), suggesting their possible yet incomplete
involvement in potentiating STAT3 phosphorylation following MEK inhibition.
Targeting the STAT3 pathway prevents the invasive phenotype induced by MEK inhibition
The complex signaling mechanisms found in melanoma indicate that multiple pathways are
involved in mediating biological responses to a given inhibitor. To confirm the importance
of the STAT3 pathway in mediating resistance to MEK inhibition, we knocked down
STAT3 in our MEK-induced invasive melanoma cell lines. Two independent shRNAs were
transduced via lentiviral infection and each shRNA caused a reduction in total STAT3 levels
(Figure 4A). We selected invasive cell lines and their respective STAT3 knockdown
counterparts to grow as spheroids in collagen or expose to a transwell invasion assay. As
shown in Figure 4A, STAT3 knockdown prevented the appearance of an invasive phenotype
in the presence of UO126. STAT3 knockdown in a different cell line, while less efficient,

also reduced invasion as assessed using a transwell invasion assay (Suppl. Figure 4). We
next examined whether we could offset the MEK inhibitor-induced invasive phenotype by
combining a MEK inhibitor with compounds targeting multiple RTKs and Src family
kinases (dasatinib), or STAT3 (CPA-7) (34). Using a fluorescent stain for live and dead
cells, we detected increased intra-spheroid cell death and reduced invasion in the
combination treatments compared to single agent MEK treatment (Figure 4B). Using a
transwell invasion assay, we observed that both dasatinib and CPA-7 had anti-invasive
properties and prevented MEK-inhibitor induced invasion; CPA-7 was more potent than
dasatinib in halting this invasion (Figure 4C).
STAT3 phosphorylation is increased in BRAF-resistant melanoma cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the current use of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutant
melanomas, we explored whether MAPK inhibition using a BRAF inhibitor instead of a
MEK inhibitor could also cause increased invasion and STAT3 phosphorylation in
metastatic melanoma cell lines. The addition of the BRAF inhibitor SB590885 (SB-885)
significantly increased the invasion of each two BRAFV600E mutant cell lines, but only
transiently (following a 20 h treatment) (Figure 5A), before cell death was observed (data
not shown). While BRAFV600E cell lines are sensitive to the addition of a BRAF inhibitor,
they still upregulate the STAT3 pathway, most notably in their counterparts that were
rendered BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BR) (Figure 5B) (9). BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines
also formed more invasive spheroids (without MEK inhibition); however, they were
sensitive to the addition of the STAT3 inhibitor CPA-7 (alone and in combination with a
BRAF inhibitor), which caused reduced spheroid size in one cell line and abrogated the
invasive phenotype (Figure 5C).
Taken together, our data suggest that in a cohort of resistant melanoma cells, BRAF or MEK
inhibitors cause the upregulation of RTKs and engagement of downstream signaling
pathways such as the Src/FAK/STAT3 network, which contribute to an invasive phenotype.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this study, we explored novel compensatory mechanisms employed by melanoma cells in
order to resist MAPK inhibition, with an emphasis on MEK inhibition. While most
preclinical studies focused on MEK-inhibition have been conducted in the two-dimensional
culture setting, which limits certain observations, here we noticed that a cohort of human
melanoma cell lines grown as 3D spheroids embedded in collagen displayed an enhanced
invasive phenotype. MEK-inhibitor induced invasion was validated using other invasion
models and was shown for multiple cell lines. Our findings were initially generated using
the MEK inhibitor UO126; however, this compound is not clinically applicable, thus we
confirmed our observations with AZD6244 which showed similar results. Invasion did not
correlate with the mutation status of BRAF or MEK, indicating that a more extensive
knowledge of the genetic or signaling cellular background is required in order to predict
which cell lines will respond adversely. Indeed, the invasion observed occurred despite the
persistent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, even following 72 h treatment with UO126 or
AZD6244, suggesting the important role of other pathways to compensate and mediate this
cellular response. Interestingly, others have previously shown that MAPK inhibition can
induce a more aggressive phenotype or cell migration in a subgroup of cell lines when plated
on a basement membrane-like matrix (8, 35). Our results are in accordance with these
findings, extend the observations to more complex 3D culture models, and add MEK
inhibitors to the list of small molecules that need to be carefully characterized and monitored
in certain patients. Indeed, as reported for VEGF-R inhibitors, there is potential to increase
the metastatic potential of tumor cells by using small molecule inhibitors in the wrong
cellular background (36, 37). While for VEGF-R-mediated increased metastasis, hypoxia

was suggested as a possible facilitator of invasion, our invasion observations using the 3D
spheroid model with MEK inhibition did not change even following 5 days of growth in 1%
O2 hypoxic conditions (data not shown). Instead, our data support the hypothesis that a rewiring of pathways following MAPK small molecule inhibitor addition and engagement of
counteracting networks cause an invasive phenotype (36).
We have previously shown the involvement of the IGFR/PI3K pathway along with
reactivation of MAPK signaling in counteracting BRAF inhibition (38). Our phospho-RTK
array and western blot results following MEK inhibitor addition also show the involvement
of IGF-1R. While we do not discount that IGFR/PI3K signaling is involved in the intrinsic
resistance of melanoma to MEK inhibition, as it is for BRAF inhibition, here we focused on
identifying novel signaling networks that could contribute to resistance and invasion
following MAPK pathway inhibition. IGF-R, PDGF-R, and FGF-R signaling has been
previously shown to activate the STAT3 pathway (29–31); additionally, studies carried out
in STAT3 null cells demonstrated that STAT3 represents an essential effector pathway of
Rho GTPases in regulating multiple cellular functions including actin cytoskeleton
reorganization, gene activation, and cell migration (39). Thus, we hypothesized and then
confirmed that STAT3 is activated following MEK inhibitor addition (in both 2D and 3D
culture).

The regulation of STAT3 activity is complex and is the point of convergence for many
tyrosine kinase signals (32). In addition to growth factors and cytokine stimulation, cell-tocell adhesion and cadherin-engagement were also shown to promote STAT3 activation and
promote cell survival (33, 40). We observed that confluence in our melanoma cells increases
STAT3 phosphorylation, but the signal is potentiated in the presence of a MEK inhibitor.
This observation can be explained by previous findings demonstrating that cadherins and
integrins associate directly with RTKs to upregulate a number of pathways and support
cellular responses such as invasion, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in (41)). Thus, both
the engagement of cell adhesion molecules and the contribution of multiple RTKs activity
could contribute to STAT3 activation in aggressive melanoma cells. Indeed, examination of
E- and N-cadherin levels following MEK inhibitor addition showed that higher N-cadherin
levels were induced. This was observed in only one treated cell line, suggesting a partial and
cell-dependent involvement of cadherins in STAT3 activation. Crosstalk between the
MAPK and STAT3 pathways was previously described at the Ser727 site on STAT3, a
phosphorylation site that has its own role and regulation of STAT3 activity (42, 43). MEK
inhibition in both our sensitive and resistant cell lines showed a decrease in phospho-STAT3
Ser727 levels; therefore, the regulation of this site alone does not explain the differential
response of our melanomas to MEK inhibition (data not show). While the mechanism of
STAT3 activation following MEK inhibition may be complex, we sought to show its role in
mediating resistance and invasion in our melanoma models. Indeed, our STAT3 knockdown
studies indicate that downregulated STAT3 prevents MEK-induced invasion. Furthermore, a
tool compound inhibiting STAT3 (CPA-7) also showed that targeting STAT3 prevents
invasion in different assays and displays cytotoxic effects in 3D melanoma spheroids. Small
molecule inhibitors of STAT3 are not yet approved for therapeutic use, but clinical trials are
ongoing to identify effective drugs (for example OPB-31121, Otsuka Pharma.) However,
compounds targeting upstream effectors of the STAT3 pathway such as RTKs, Src, and
JAKs are available and have already been assessed in the clinic. Our study shows that
targeting RTKs with dasatinib does not cause extensive spheroid cell death compared to
targetingSTAT3 directly, in agreement with previous studies (44). However, higher drug
concentrations may be warranted to achieve cell death when a MEK inhibitor is present
since the drug target activities, namely that of the RTKs and Src, are upregulated. In
accordance with our findings, recent MEK and SRC inhibitor combinations have shown
anti-melanoma activity (45). Also encouragingly, inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling

pathway was shown to impede the migratory and invasive potential of human glioblastoma
cells and the effects were observed in both PTEN-expressing and PTEN-deficient cells (46).
The combination of MEK inhibitors and effectors of the STAT3 pathway may therefore be
useful in curbing melanoma progression and increase patient survival.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we extended our observations of an increasingly activated STAT3 pathway in
BRAF-resistant melanoma cell lines, which are also more invasive compared to their
parental counterparts. These observations indicate that SRC, JAK, and STAT3 inhibitors
could also be useful for BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cases. In sum, our studies
indicate that despite harboring high MAPK pathway activity, not all melanomas respond
favorably to inhibition of the pathway and can engage an intrinsically resistant response with
potential adverse effects such as induced invasion. We identify STAT3 as a pathway
upregulated upon MEK inhibition in a cohort of aggressive melanoma cell lines, and in cell
lines rendered resistant to BRAF inhibition. Our study also highlights the usefulness of 3D
culture methods to further characterize compounds and their potential adverse effects. A
future challenge will be to identify which patients will most benefit from a MEK, BRAF,
and SRC/JAK/STAT3 inhibition combination. Such a treatment strategy may be useful for
all patients, or could provide a novel option to patients displaying intrinsic or acquired
resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Additionally, given the role of STAT3 in evading
the immune response, it would be interesting to explore the correlation between STAT3
activity and response to immunotherapies.

Invasion assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Transwell invasion chambers (Becton Dickinson), 24-well format, were used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and 50μL of collagen mix (as described above) were used to
coat the membrane prior to use. Briefly, cells were suspended in 100μL serum-free medium
before being loaded into an upper invasion chamber. Cells were allowed to adhere for 4h
with the upper chamber sitting in a well containing 750μL of freshly collected conditioned
medium from each respective cell line grown for 72h. Inhibitors or the vehicle control
DMSO were then added in 100μL serum-free medium for a final concentration as indicated,
and the cells were allowed to migrate for 72h towards conditioned media. Prior to imaging,
noninvasive cells were removed from the upper chamber and the remaining invasive cells
were stained with DAPI. Fluorescent staining was examined using a Nikon TE2000 inverted
microscope.
Western blots and RTK array analyses
Proteins were extracted as previously described (55) and 50μg of cell extract were resolved
on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel before being transferred onto a polyvinylidene membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were handled and imaged as previously described
(56), or they were analyzed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln,
NE). All primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA. The
secondary antibodies IRDye 700 and IRDye 800 were from Li-Cor. To identify the relative
levels of phosphorylation of RTKs, we used a human phospho-RTK array kit (ARY001;
R&D Systems Minneapolis, MN), according to manufacturer instructions.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on a glass coverslip and were treated with DMSO or MEK inhibitor for 72
h prior to fixation and imaging as previously described (55). Antibodies used were anti-FAK

keratinocytes and seeded on top of the dermal reconstructs at a ratio of 1:5 (melanoma cells
to keratinocytes). Cells were cultured in skin reconstruct media (Suppl. Materials and
Methods) then raised to the air—liquid interface on day 5, via feeding from below with
medium. Two weeks later, skin reconstructs were harvested for imaging or fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin for 4–6 hours before being processed by routine histological
methods. The exposure of skin reconstructs to inhibitors involved the pre-treatment of
melanoma cells (with vehicle control or 10μM of MEK inhibitor) prior to mixing with the
keratinocytes, then the addition of compound (same concentration) to the feeding media in
the last 72h of skin reconstruct growth.
Two-photon microscopy imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Deep tissue imaging was performed using a Prairie Ultima II 2-photon microscope (Prairie
Technologies, Inc, Middleton, WI). The system incorporates a fixed-stage upright Olympus
BX61WI microscope, a Chameleon XR femtosecond pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent
Laser Group, Santa Clara, CA) with excitation ranging from 710–980nm, and a 4 channel,
filter based detection system. Unfixed tissue samples were directly imaged with a 40X
PlanFl/IR water immersion lens to a standardized depth of 200 microns. Excitation at 910nm
provided signal from the GFP labeled melanoma cells and also provided a Second Harmonic
Signal (SHG) to visualize the upper collagen layer. Stacks of 100 slices were generated in 2
channels and 3D reconstruction and analysis was accomplished using ImagePro Plus 3D
software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring Maryland).
Statistical analysis
The two-way analysis of variance was used to test for treatment effects on invasion
controlling for cell line after taking the natural logarithm of invasion. When there was a
significant interaction, comparisons were done for each cell line. T-tests using
Satterwaithe’s method, when variances were unequal were used to test for cell line-specific
treatment effects on distance traveled in the skin reconstruct experiments. Tukey’s
procedure was used to evaluate pairwise differences when an ANOVA was significant. Error
bars represent standard errors.

Figure 1. MEK inhibition causes increased migration/invasion in a cohort of melanoma cell lines

A) 3D melanoma spheroids growing in a collagen matrix and treated with increasing doses
of the MEK inhibitor UO126 for 72 h show invasive edges. Sample images are shown. Scale
bar represents 200 microns for all panels except 1205Lu (600 microns). B) Quantitation of
melanoma cell motility from spheroid edge in cell lines grown as spheroids as shown for
(A). Values indicate the relative spheroid invasion area compared to the vehicle controltreated spheroids. The invasion observed in the treated spheroids was significantly higher
than in the untreated spheroids (p=0.0095), controlling for cell line (p<0.0001). Experiments
were conducted in triplicate. C) The early melanoma stage cell lines WM35 and WM793 are
sensitive to UO126 and display reduced growth and invasion upon a 72 h treatment.
Spheroid size differences are delineated in red, based on circumference of the untreated
samples. Scale bar represents 600 microns. D) Transwell invasion assay showing DAPI
staining of single cells invading through a collagen-coated semi-porous membrane in the
presence of UO126 (10μM). Cells were allowed to invade for 72 h and representative

triplicate; (WM3918, p=0.010; WM983B, p=0.999; 1205Lu, p=0.010). F) Computer
generated 3D model of a skin reconstruct section depicting invading 1205Lu melanoma cells
(green). The model is based on 2-photon images and allows a 3D view of the invasion
profile of GFP-tagged melanoma cells in a skin reconstruct, as well as the quantitation of the
perpendicular distance traveled by individual 1205Lu cells from the basement membrane.
Multiple skin reconstruct sections were imaged, recreated in 3D, and quantitated based on
this model and results are summarized in (G). G) Histogram summarizing the average
distance travelled by invasive 1205Lu cells (in microns) in skin reconstructs exposed to
vehicle control or UO126 (10uM). The perpendicular distance was measured over three
different sections per condition, tracking the 5 most invasive cells per section using the 3D
modeling system shown in (F). This distance was significantly higher for MEK-inhibitor
treated cells than for untreated cells (p<0.0001). Error bars represent standard errors.

A) Transwell invasion assay showing DAPI staining of single melanoma cells invading
through a collagen-coated semi-porous membrane in the presence of SB590885 (1μM).
Cells were allowed to invade for 20 h. Representative photomicrographs are shown and
scale bar represents 600 microns. A histogram shows the quantitation of melanoma cell
invasion from transwell assays conducted in triplicate for two cell lines. Relative number of
invasive cells in treated compared to the vehicle control-treated cells are shown. Relative
invasion was significantly different for both cell lines (WM938B, p=0.016 and 1205Lu,
p=0.004). Error bars depict standard errors. B) Western blot analysis of immunolysates from
BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines treated with SB590885 or vehicle control for 72 h.
WT indicates the parental cell lines; BR indicates the BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell line
counterpart. Phosphorylated and total levels of STAT3, MEK, and ERK are shown, as well
as the HSP90 loading control. C) SB590885 (SB-885; 1μM) and CPA-7 (10μM) were added
to collagen-embedded spheroids for 72 h. Spheroids were generated from BRAFV600E
mutant melanoma cell lines (parental or BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BR)). Survival and
invasion were monitored using a live/dead assay and representative images are shown.
Green fluorescence indicates metabolically active (live) cells; red fluorescence indicates
