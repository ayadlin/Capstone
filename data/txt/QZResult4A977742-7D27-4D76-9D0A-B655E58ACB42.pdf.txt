ABSTRACT
Aims: To assess the efficacy of continued administration of sorafenib for patients
with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with local regional therapy
(LRT) after a complete response (CR), also, the adverse events of sorafenib after
discontinuation of administration were observed.
Methods: Between April 2008 and May 2012, 956 consecutive patients with
unresectable HCC treated with LRT (transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency
ablation) combined with sorafenib were retrospectively investigated. Of these, 157
patients with a CR were enrolled: 102 of them continued to receive sorafenib (test
group) and the other 55 stopped receiving sorafenib (control group).
Results: The median recurrence-free survival (RFS), post-complete response
overall survival (pOS) and overall survival (OS) in the test and control groups were
11 months (95% CI: 6.1, 15.9), 25 months (95% CI: 20.7, 29.3) and 33 months
(95% CI: 29.2, 36.8) and 12 months (95% CI: 10.4, 13.6), 28 months (95% CI
24.2, 31.8) and 34 months (95% CI: 30.8, 37.2) respectively. The differences in RFS,
pOS and OS between the groups were not significant (P = 0.768, 0.797 and 0.730,
respectively). The adverse events related to sorafenib resolved after discontinuation
of administration and the quality of life (QoL) scores improved.
Conclusions: Patients with unresectable HCC who achieved a CR did not benefit
from continued sorafenib in terms of RFS, pOS or OS. The adverse events of sorafenib
were reversible, and discontinuation of sorafenib may improve the QoL of patients
who have achieved a CR.

of all HCCs are diagnosed at an unresectable tumor stage
with a median overall survival of 11–20 months [2, 3].
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are the most common local
regional treatments (LRT) for most patients with unresectable
HCC [2–5]. Moreover, the combination of TACE and
RFA is more effective than TACE or RFA alone for the
treatment of patients with large HCC exceeding 3.5 cm
[6, 7]. However, after TACE, the residual cancer cells are in
an extensive hypoxic or even anoxic environment. Hypoxia

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common malignancy and the third leading cause of
cancer-related death worldwide, and its incidence is
increasing [1]. Liver resection, liver transplantation, and
percutaneous ablation are the main radical treatments for
HCC. Unfortunately, only 30–40% of early stage patients
(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer BCLC stage A) are
amenable for such curative therapies, and more than 50%

can lead to adaptive responses with VEGF overexpression
[8], which may lead to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.
Sorafenib, an oral inhibitor of multiple kinases involved in
HCC proliferation and angiogenesis, is recommended for
advanced HCC [2, 3, 9, 10].
Recently, there has been increasing focus on LRT
combined with sorafenib to potentially improve the
efficacy for patients with unresectable HCC [11–14].
However, these clinical studies did not address whether
sorafenib is effective in the few patients who have
achieved a complete response (CR). In our clinical
practice, a few patients with unresectable HCC who
treated with LRT have achieved a CR are continued on
sorafenib. This is made possible by a program supported
by the China Charity Federation that funds continued
sorafenib treatment after the first 3 months for patients
who benefit from its initial administration. Without
the additional financial burden, most patients prefer
to continue sorafenib administration even if they have
achieved a CR. However, when a tumor has achieved a
CR, regular surveillance is usually performed rather than
continued treatment in clinical practice.
However, the STORM study [15] (Sorafenib as
Adjuvant Treatment in the Prevention of Recurrence
of Hepatocellular Carcinoma) found that the
administration of sorafenib to HCC patients after
potentially curative treatments conferred no benefits
in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS) or time to
recurrence, the study cohort consisted of BCLC stage
A patients who had undergone curative therapy. It is
well known, recurrence rate of unresectable stage
HCC treated with LRT is significantly higher than
that of early stage HCC after curative treatment [2,
3]. Therefore, it is important to clarify the efficacy of
continued sorafenib in patients who had unresectable
stage HCC and high recurrence risk.
We conducted a retrospective study of 157 patients
with unresectable HCC who had achieved a CR and
compared the RFS, post-complete response overall
survival (pOS) and overall survival (OS) between patients
with continued sorafenib treatment and patients without
sorafenib treatment after a CR. The adverse events of
sorafenib after discontinuation were also observed.

55 patients the administration of sorafenib was stopped
(control group) (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics
of all patients are shown in Table 1. These did not differ
significantly between the two groups in terms of the cause
of liver disease, liver function, tumor characteristics or
previous therapy. The majority of the patients were male
and hepatitis B virus infection was the most common
underlying disease. All of patients were at BCLC stage B.

RESULTS

Safety and toxicity

Study population

The adverse events related to treatment with TACE,
RFA and sorafenib were comparable to those reported in
the literature [9–14], and there were no deaths related to
any of these treatments. The most common complications
after TACE or RFA were abdominal pain (68.2%), fever
(35.0%), vomiting (45.9%), temporary elevation of
transaminase (58.6%), ascites (5.1%), pleural effusion
(2.5%) and liver abscess (0.6%) (Table 3).
Sixteen temporary reductions in sorafenib dose were
made because of toxicity in the test group and 5 in the

Treatment
The median duration of sorafenib administration
before CR in the test and control groups was 5.4 months
(range, 1–9) and 5.0 months (range, 0.5–9), respectively,
The median duration of sorafenib treatment after CR in the
test group was 25.4 months (range, 12–55). The median
number of TACE procedures per patient in the test and
control groups were 6.2 (range, 1–12) and 4.7 (range,
2–10), respectively, and the median number of RFA
procedures per patient in the test and control groups was
0.6 (range, 0–3) and 0.8 (range, 0–4), respectively.

Survival
At the end of follow-up (December 2013), 72
(70.6%) patients in the test group and 40 (72.7%) patients
in the control group had died. The median follow-up for
these patients was 34.6 ± 11.8 months (range, 22–68) and
the total follow-up time after initial therapy was more than
5 years. The causes of death are listed in Table 2.
Recurrence free survival, The median RFS was
11 months in the test group (95% CI: 6.1, 15.9) and 12
months in the control group (95% CI: 10.4, 13.6); this
difference was not significant. (P = 0.768; Figure 2A).
Post-complete response overall survival, The
median pOS was 25 months (95% CI 20.7, 29.3) in the test
group and 28 months (95% CI 24.2, 31.8) in the control
group; this difference was not significant. (P = 0.797;
Figure 2B).
Overall survival, The median OS was 33 months
(95% CI 29.2, 36.8) in the test group and 34 months (95%
CI 30.8, 37.2) in the control group; this difference was not
significant. (P = 0.730; Figure 2C).

In total, between April 2008 and May 2012, 956
consecutive patients with unresectable HCC treated
with LRT (TACE, RFA) combined with sorafenib were
retrospectively observed during the study period. A total
of 799 patients were excluded from the study because they
met the exclusion criteria. As a result, 157 patients who
had achieved a CR were enrolled in this study, 102 of them
continued to receive sorafenib (test group) and the other

control group, respectively. Sorafenib was discontinued
permanently because of tumor progression and liver
dysfunction in 21 patients in the test group. Three patients
stop administrating sorafenib because of the adverse
events in the control group. The others received the full
dose of sorafenib without interruption due to toxicity.
The most common adverse events related to sorafenib
were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), alopecia, diarrhea,
weight loss, fatigue, and hypertension. The most common
grade 3 or higher adverse events were HFSR, diarrhea and
hypertension. Before the discontinuation, the incidence
of side effects of sorafenib was similar between the two
groups. However, two months after discontinuation, the
most of side effects of sorafenib were resolved in the
control group. The adverse events related to sorafenib are
listed in Table 4.
QoL Symptom score questionnaire responses were
collected from 154 (98.1%) of 157 patients at one month
after administration of sorafenib, 146 patients (93.0%) at the
2 months after the discontinuation of sorafenib. There were no
significant differences in QoL score between the two groups
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at one month after administration of sorafenib. However, at
the 2 months after the CR, QoL scores were significantly
higher in the control group (P < 0.001; Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
We assessed whether sorafenib further improves
the survival of patients with unresectable HCC who have
achieved a CR. We also observed the adverse events related
to sorafenib that occurred when administration was stopped.
This is the first study to date to compare the efficacy of
sorafenib for unresectable HCC in patients with CR. The
data came from the center which had the largest population
of liver cancer and considerable experience with TACE and
RFA in the South China. This study also has the longest
follow-up since sorafenib was introduced in 2008.
The modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors (mRECIST) [16] is the most used radiological
evaluation for HCC. Sometimes evaluation of CR can
be difficult and depends on the individual radiologist’s
experience, but also on the imaging equipment used,

especially for larger tumors. Although serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) is not currently recommended as a
diagnosis marker for HCC [2, 3], in patients with cirrhosis
or chronic hepatitis B, AFP is an important indicator
of diagnosis and prediction for HCC occurrence [17].
Therefore, we used radiological evaluation together with
AFP evaluation to assess the efficacy of treatment; both
radiological evaluation criteria and AFP normalization can
be used to assess CR except in cases of HCC with negative
serum AFP. Therefore, this may improve the power of
evaluation of CR.
Interestingly, the results of this study showed that
the median RFS, pOS and OS were slightly longer in
controls than in the test group. However, this difference
was not statistically significant. Therefore, we suggest
that continued administration of sorafenib may not benefit
patients with unresectable HCC who have had a CR. This
contradicts studies showing the effectiveness of TACE
with sorafenib for intermediate-advanced HCC [11–14],
but might be explained by the inclusion of more advanced
stage patients with fewer CRs in those studies. On the
other hand, we confirm the results of another report [18]
showing that TACE plus sorafenib achieved a comparable
effectiveness to treatment with TACE alone for patients
with HCC (most patients were BCLC stage A and B).
Similarly, Cabrera et al. [12] reported that the combination
of TACE and sorafenib achieved a median survival time of
18.5 months for patients with BCLC stage B. Clinical trial
and meta-analysis data confirm that chemoembolization
improves survival of BCLC stage B patients up to 19–20
months [3, 19]. Moreover, the phase III STORM study
found that the administration of sorafenib to HCC patients
after potentially curative treatments conferred no benefits
in terms of RFS or time to recurrence [15].
There are two likely explanations for our findings.
First, sorafenib blocks tumor cell proliferation by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targeting Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and exerts tumor
angiogenesis by targeting VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2,
VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-β [9, 10], which is different from
the molecular mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis [20].
Second, acquired resistance to molecular target agent
inevitably occurs in almost all tumors including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [21], and gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST) [22]. Therefore, a long duration
of sorafenib for patients with unresectable HCC after CR
may not be effective.
In addition, the quality of life is a priority in
every disease management. Our results showed that
the side effects of sorafenib, such as HFSR, diarrhea
and hypertension, resolved after the discontinuation
of sorafenib. Weight loss and alopecia also improved
gradually. We suppose that these were the main causes of
the improvement in the QoL score in the control group
after the discontinuation of sorafenib.
This study has several limitations. First, it is a
retrospective analysis and the sample size of control
group is relatively small. Second, therapeutic options
(continuation or discontinuation) in patients with
unresectable HCC after a CR were individually determined
by the attending physician, which likely led to selection
bias in our population. However, the bias was limited
by choosing similar baseline characteristics between the
two groups. Third, the time point at which patients began
to take sorafenib was not coincident, but this difference
between the two groups was not significant. In this study,
although patients with CR were downstaged, none of
those were treated with surgical or liver transplantation.
The main reasons were as follows: (i) most of the patients
had multiple-nodules; (ii) a donor liver would have been
insufficient for all HCC patients; and (iii) consideration
of the complexity and cost of the liver transplantation
procedure.

Radiofrequency ablation

In conclusion, our findings suggest that there is
no benefit in terms of RFS, pOS and OS in continuing
sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC who
have achieved a CR. The side effects of sorafenib
were reversible, and the quality of life of patients was
improved after discontinuation of sorafenib. Further
and larger prospective trials are needed to confirm this
conclusion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RFA [24] was performed by using the RFA
system (Cool-Tip Valleylab, USA) under real-time
ultrasound guidance. After administration of analgesia
(50–60 mg of propofol and 0.05−0.1 mg of fentanyl
and local anaesthesia 5−15 mL of 2% lidocaine) by an
anaesthesiologist, a 17-Ga RFA needle was inserted into
the tumor. Each radiofrequency energy application lasted
for 10 min, with the tissue temperature reaching 90°C for
at least 12 min.

Study design and patient selection

Adjuvant sorafenib treatment

The study protocol was approved by the First
Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University ethics
committees. Written informed consent was obtained from
each participant in according with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Between April 2008 and May 2012, consecutive
patients with unresectable HCC treated with LRT (TACE,
RFA) combined with sorafenib were retrospectively
studied.
Inclusion criteria: (a) all patients had patho­
logically or radiologically (contrast-enhanced CT)
confirmed unresectable HCC (BCLC stage B or C)
based on the European Association for the Study of
the Liver (EASL) diagnostic criteria [3]. (b) Patients
with unresectable HCC treated with LRT (repeated
TACE or combination of TACE and RFA) combined
with sorafenib who had achieved a CR (A CR in
HCC patients positive for AFP was assessed based on
radiologic criteria according to mRECIST [16] and AFP
normalization [17, 23]; CR in HCC patients negative for
AFP was assessed based on radiologic criteria according
to mRECIST. The patients who did not achieve a CR,
those with a secondary malignancy, those with previous
liver transplantation, and those with missing data were
excluded. When a CR was observed, the discontinuation
of sorafenib was recommended by the attending
physician. If the patient agreed to the physician’s
recommendation, sorafenib was discontinued after the
CR. Sorafenib was continued after the CR in patients
who disagreed to the recommendation.

Generally, sorafenib treatment was started 1–3 days
after LRT. The initial dose of oral sorafenib was 400 mg
given twice daily [11]. Administration was suspended on
the day procedure was performed and was resumed the next
day. Doses were modified depending on toxicity, according
to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. The sorafenib
dose was reduced to 400 mg once a day for patients grade
3 toxicity. Continued administration of sorafenib was
encouraged if the side-effects were manageable.

Follow-up
Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the liver and AFP
were performed 4–6 weeks after TACE or RFA to evaluate
the effect of the treatment. If there was still residual viable
tumor or new lesions had formed, additional TACE or
RFA was performed. If patients had more than 3 tumors,
or the size of a tumor was more than 3 cm, TACE was
administered first. If patients with a CR to liver lesions, a
further contrast-enhanced MRI of head, a chest CT scan and
bone scintigraphy were performed to make sure there was
no extrahepatic spread. In patients with a CR, the followup was performed every 2 months in the first 2 years. The
follow-up interval was extended to every 3 months from 2 to
4 years after treatment and to every 6 months after 4 years.
At each follow-up session, contrast-enhanced CT scan of
abdomen, chest radiography, liver function test and AFP were
performed. When recurrence was detected, the patients were
selected for TACE, RFA, or conservative treatment, based
on the number of tumors or the size or the site of tumor, the
liver function tests, and the general condition of the patient.

Protocols for LRT
TACE procedure

Assessments

Briefly, 10 to 20 mL lipiodol (Guerbet, Paris,
France) was mixed with 20–40 mg epirubicin (Pfizer,
New York, USA) to create an emulsion. Depending on the
tumor size and liver function, 2–20 mL of the emulsion
was infused into the liver tumor through a catheter.
Subsequently, embolization using gelfoam was carried out.
When blood flow slowed or a vascular cast was observed,
the injection was stopped. The tumor-feeding artery was
selected or super-selected whenever possible [11].

In HCC patients negative for AFP (a baseline
AFP level < 20 ng/mL), treatment efficacy was assessed
based on radiological evaluation according to mRECIST
(complete response = disappearance of any intratumoral
arterial enhancement in all target lesions). In HCC patients
positive for AFP (a baseline AFP level > 20 ng/mL),
CR was assessed based on radiological evaluation
and AFP normalization (AFP level < 20 ng/mL) [17].

transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as a combined
therapy for unresectable non-early hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Eur Radiol. 2006; 16:661–669.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
software (version 16.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). For baseline
characteristics, continuous variables are described as
medians ± standard deviation and categorical variables
are expressed as frequencies and percentages. The t test
was used to compare continuous variables between the
two groups. The χ2 test was used to compare categorical
variables between the two groups. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to calculate the RFS, pOS and OS. Logrank test was used to determine the difference between
the two groups. All statistical tests were two-sided, and
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
