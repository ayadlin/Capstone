BACKGROUND: The activity and safety of vinflunine was evaluated in patients with locally advanced or
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who developed disease progression within 12 months of platinumcontaining chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with UC were eligible if they received a prior platinum-based
regimen in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting or as first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic disease and
had developed disease progression within 12 months. Vinflunine was administered intravenously every 3
weeks. Patients with Karnofsky performance status of 80 or 90, impaired renal function, prior pelvic irradiation, or age 75 years received an initial dose of 280 mg/m2, which was escalated to 320 mg/m2 in Cycle
2 if well tolerated. All other patients received an initial dose of 320 mg/m2. The primary endpoint was
response rate defined by an independent response review committee (IRRC). RESULTS: Per the IRRC, 22
patients achieved a partial response, with a response rate of 15% (95% confidence interval, 9%-21%) with a
median duration of response of 6.0 months. Sixty-four (42%) patients had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 2.8 months, and the median overall survival was 8.2 months. Myelosuppression
was the most frequent adverse event, with grade 3 of 4 (adverse events were evaluated according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] guidelines) neutropenia reported in 58%
of the patients. Grade 3 of 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 10 (7%) patients. Nonhematologic treatmentrelated events (grade 3 of 4) were generally manageable and included constipation (17%), asthenia/fatigue
(13%), ileus (5%), and abdominal pain (5%). No cumulative toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Vinflunine demonstrates moderate activity in patients with platinum-pretreated UC. Toxicity is manageable and

Vinflunine in Platinum-Pretreated UC/Vaughn et al

The combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin has been the comparative standard
of care for metastatic urothelial cancer since it was
demonstrated to increase survival over single-agent
cisplatin in 1992.1 The combination of gemcitabine
and cisplatin was found to have similar efficacy in this
population with a study designed to show
superiority.2,3 Nevertheless, because of a modest safety
advantage, it has become 1 of the most frequently used
regimens for the first-line treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients. Unfortunately, the vast majority
of patients treated with combination cisplatin-based
regimens develop progressive disease within 8 months
of treatment, and the median survival is reported to be
only 13 to 15 months.2
To our knowledge, there currently is no approved
treatment option for the UC patients who develop disease
recurrence or progression after a platinum-containing regimen. Multiple agents against both traditional and novel
targets have been studied in small single-arm clinical trials
in the second-line setting.4-6 Despite initial enthusiasm
for several, none had sufficient robust activity to generate
a phase 3 trial.
Vinflunine is a novel microtubule inhibitor of the
vinca alkaloid class.7,8 Preclinical studies demonstrated
that it has more activity than vinblastine or vinorelbine.9,10 For example, in an orthotopic model of bladder
cancer in mice, vinflunine was found to be more effective
than vinorelbine.11 The clinical activity of vinflunine was
recently assessed in 51 bladder cancer patients from
Europe who had received prior platinum treatment.12
The response rate (RR) was 18% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8%-31%), with a median progression-free
survival (PFS) of 3.0 months and a median overall survival
(OS) of 6.6 months. Given these promising results, and
the unmet need for second-line treatment, 2 trials were
initiated evaluating the efficacy of vinflunine in this
setting. The first was a multicenter, open-label, singleagent, large phase 2 trial, evaluating the activity of
vinflunine in patients with UC who developed disease
progression within 12 months of receiving platinumbased chemotherapy. For registrational purposes, this trial
was performed largely in the United States; it is the subject
of this report. The second was a phase 3 trial comparing
best supportive care versus vinflunine plus best supportive
care for platinum-pretreated UC patients. Initial results of

et al.13

PATIENTS
Eligible patients had histologically proven advanced or
metastatic UC (excluding pure nontransitional histologies)
that was not amenable to definitive regional/local therapy,
with documented disease recurrence or progression within
12 months of the last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy. At least 2 cycles of cisplatin (60 mg/m2) or carboplatin (area under the curve, 4) in any previous
setting were required. Platinum-based chemotherapy
could have been used in the metastatic, adjuvant, or neoadjuvant settings. Eligible patients were aged 18 years
with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 80 and
adequate hematologic (absolute neutrophil count 1500
cells/mm3 and platelet count 100,000 cells/mm3) and
hepatic function (based on total serum bilirubin level and
transaminases). Patients with renal impairment were eligible if the calculated creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault formula was >20 mL/min. Patients who
received >1 previous chemotherapy regimen in any setting
or prior radiation to >30% of the bone marrow, or those
who had pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (grade 2 or
higher), were deemed ineligible. The study was reviewed
and approved by institutional review boards or ethical
committees at the participating institutions, and all
patients provided written informed consent.

VINFLUNINE ADMINISTRATION AND
EVALUATION OF ENDPOINTS
Vinflunine was administered every 3 weeks as a 15-minute
to 20-minute intravenous infusion. Based on initial experience with the tolerability of vinflunine and its partly
renal clearance, patients with a KPS of 80 or 90, renal
impairment (calculated creatinine clearance between
20 mL/min and 60 mL/min), prior pelvic irradiation, or
age 75 years received an initial dose of vinflunine of
280 mg/m2, which was escalated to 320 mg/m2 in Cycle 2
if well tolerated. Other patients received an initial vinflunine dose of 320 mg/m2, which could be reduced to
280 mg/m2 or 250 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles because of
grade 3 of 4 toxicity. Treatment was discontinued if
serious toxicity was again observed at the lower dose. No

dose re-escalation was allowed after dose reduction.
Adverse events were evaluated according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0)
guidelines. To prevent constipation, dietary measures and
laxatives were administered to patients from Day 1 to Day
5 or 7 of each cycle. Tumor assessments using computed
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were
obtained within 4 weeks of study entry and were repeated
every 6 weeks, using the same methods used at baseline.
An independent response review committee (IRRC)
reviewed all tumor assessments and determined the best
response, and the duration of response or stable disease
(SD) was determined according to the bidimensional
modified World Health Organization criteria.14

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary objective of this trial was to confirm the activity of vinflunine demonstrated in the smaller phase 2
trial,12 and to define the objective RR with more precision. The primary hypothesis of the trial was that vinflunine would result in a RR of approximately 15%. If the
RR was determined to be >15%, the agent would be considered worthy of further study. The sample size was predetermined to achieve a desired CI width around the
estimated RR. Assuming an estimated RR of 15%, for
150 patients, the exact 2-sided 95% CI would extend to a
maximum width of 12%, and the lower limit of the CI
would be 10%.
The primary endpoint was RR as defined by the
IRRC. The secondary endpoints were duration of
response, time to response, disease control rate, PFS, OS,
and the safety profile of vinflunine.
All analyses were conducted on patients who
received at least 1 dose of vinflunine (N ¼ 151; 100%),
except for duration of response and time to response,
which were based on the response-evaluable population
(N ¼ 132; 87%). Duration of response, PFS, and OS
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

years received an initial dose of 280 mg/m2. Although the
majority of the patients had UC of the urinary bladder,
30% had an upper tract or urethral UC. The IRRC review
of the tumor assessments revealed that 11 (7%) patients
did not have measurable disease at baseline. The majority
of the patients (71%) had >1 measurable lesion, a large
proportion of the lesions were metastatic to the lung or to
the liver, and approximately half of the patients had
visceral disease (49%). All patients had received prior
platinum-containing chemotherapy, combined with
gemcitabine in 91% of the patients, in either the neoadjuvant (4%), adjuvant (32%), or metastatic (61%) settings.
Several patients had received both cisplatin and carboplatin. The time between prior chemotherapy and disease
progression was <6 months in 77% of patients and <3
months in 54%. The interval was 12 months in 3 (2%)
patients. Nearly all patients (93%) underwent primary
definitive surgery for their UC, and 12% had received
pelvic radiotherapy.
Efficacy Evaluation
The median duration of treatment was 9.3 weeks (range,
1.1 weeks-64.1 weeks), and the median duration of
follow-up was 11.9 months. Per IRRC review, the RR was
15% (95% CI, 9%-21%, based on 151 subjects and
22 responses), and the median duration of response was
6.0 months (95% CI, 5.4 months-9.5 months). The
IRRC response rate was higher than the investigators’
assessed RR (Table 2). SD was observed in 64 patients
(42%), with a median duration of disease stabilization of
Cancer

September 15, 2009

4.0 months (95% CI, 3.5 months-4.7 months). The median time to response was 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2
months-3.0 months), the median PFS was 2.8 months
(95% CI, 2.6 months-3.8 months), and the median overall survival was 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.8 months-9.6
months) (Fig. 1), with 31% of the patients receiving subsequent chemotherapy. In the 132 evaluable patients as
per IRRC, the overall RR was 16% (95% CI, 10%-23%),
and 45% achieved SD. In a predefined subset analysis,
responses were observed in patients with visceral disease
(RR, 9%; 95% CI, 4%-19%), an estimated creatinine
clearance between 20 mL/minute to 60 mL/minute (RR,
13%; 95% CI, 6%-24%), Karnofsky performance status
of 80 (RR, 10%; 95% CI, 4%-23%), and age 65 years
(RR, 21%; 95% CI, 13%-32%).
Safety Evaluation
A total of 577 cycles of vinflunine were administered,
with a median of 3 cycles per patient (range, 1 cycle-21
cycles). Forty (26%) patients received an initial dose of
320 mg/m2; this was reduced to 280 mg/m2 in Cycle 2
in 13 patients with a relative dose intensity over the
median 2 administered cycles of 99% (range, 67%116%). For the 111 (74%) patients who received an
initial dose of 280 mg/m2, 41 (37%) had a dose escalation
to 320 mg/m2, and 22 (20%) had a dose reduction, giving
a relative dose intensity of 93% (range, 42%-101%) over
the median 3 administered cycles. Thirty-nine (26%) of
151 patients had a delay in at least 1 cycle of treatment.
The main toxicity of vinflunine was hematologic
(Table 3), with grade 3 of 4 neutropenia reported in 58%
of the patients, leukopenia in 49%, and anemia in 16%.
However, severe thrombocytopenia was rare (3% of the
patients). Ten (7%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia; in none of the patients did this lead to study discontinuation. Grade 3 of 4 nonhematologic treatment–
related adverse events (Table 4) included constipation
(17% of the patients), asthenia/fatigue (13%), abdominal
pain (5%), and ileus (5%). Constipation was most prevalent during the first cycle. Despite the prior treatment
with platinum, peripheral neuropathy was rare, and only
1 patient (1%) experienced grade 3 atypical peripheral
sensory neuropathy. This safety profile was similar in
patients with renal impairment, in whom vinflunine did
not induce a deterioration of renal function.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival are shown. 95% CI indicates 95% confidence interval; VFL, vinflunine.

Twenty-two (15%) patients discontinued treatment because of vinflunine-related adverse events. Two
(1%) treatment-related deaths were reported, 1 because
of myocardial infarction in an 83-year-old patient
during the 4th cycle, and the other because of neutropenic sepsis during the first cycle in a patient with several risk factors.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study indicate that vinflunine
has moderate activity in platinum-pretreated patients
4114

with advanced UC. The RR defined by the IRRC was
similar to the estimate identified at study design, and
confirmed the RR previously obtained with singleagent vinflunine in this patient population.12
Responses were observed in all subsets of patients,
including those with poor prognostic factors (visceral
disease and decreased KPS) or with unfavorable characteristics (renal impairment, advanced age, and refractory disease defined as disease recurring <3 months
after last prior therapy).

literature indicates that, to date, all trials performed with
single agents in the second-line setting included <60
patients.4-6 Because patient populations are different
between studies, one cannot compare efficacy endpoints
among studies.
The high frequency of renal impairment in this
patient population is an important point. The causes of
Cancer

September 15, 2009

renal impairment are multiple, including disease-related
(ureteral obstruction), treatment-related (prior nephrectomy, nephrotoxicity of cisplatin), and patient-related
(age, comorbidities) factors. Vinflunine has a mixed
metabolism through the liver (approximately two-thirds)
and the kidney, a characteristic that makes it potentially
advantageous for the treatment of UC.14 Vinflunine did
4115

Original Article

not demonstrate any evidence of nephrotoxicity, even in
the patient population with impaired renal function.
The safety profile of vinflunine in this study is similar to a previous pooled analysis of several clinical trials.15
The main toxicity of vinflunine is hematologic. Although
the incidence of grade 3 of 4 neutropenia was found to be
high with vinflunine (58%), the frequency of febrile neutropenia was low (7%), and this adverse event was not a
cause for study discontinuation. Of note, a patient with
poor risk factors died in the first cycle from severe sepsis;
therefore, prophylactic measures such as growth factors
and/or antibiotics should be implemented in such
patients.
The main nonhematologic adverse events were
fatigue and constipation, which were both noncumulative and reversible. Constipation was most frequently observed during the first cycle, indicating
that it was most likely not because of neurotoxicity.
Prophylactic measures against constipation must be
used, especially in patients with an increased risk for
constipation, such as the use of opioid analgesics.
Despite prior treatment with platinum compounds,
the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was low after
vinflunine, something that was predicted based on
the characteristics of the microtubule binding of vinflunine.15 However, the relative low incidence of
neurotoxicity could in part be related to the finding
that the median number of cycles received was only
3, thus limiting the potential for cumulative toxicity.
In this study, 2 initial dose levels of vinflunine were
used based on the baseline characteristics of the
patients. It does not appear that the safety profile of
vinflunine is different according to the initial dose, a
satisfactory result because patients receiving the lower
dose had an unfavorable profile (decreased KPS, renal impairment, and/or pelvic irradiation).
New agents with improved efficacy and adequate
tolerability are needed for patients with advanced UC
who have received previous platinum-based regimens,
a patient population for which to our knowledge no
standard of care exists. Therapy for these patients is
further complicated by poor performance status,
comorbidities, and inadequate renal function. In this
respect, vinflunine is moderately active and has a
manageable and noncumulative toxicity profile without nephrotoxicity.
