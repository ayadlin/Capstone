ABSTRACT
Drug combination therapies remain pivotal for the treatment of heterogeneous
malignancies, such as glioblastomas. Here, we show a novel lethal interaction
between Bcl-xL and c-myc inhibition accomplished by bromodomain protein inhibitors.
Established, patient-derived xenograft and stem cell-like glioma cells were treated
with the novel bromodomain protein inhibitors, JQ1 and OTX015, along with BH3mimetics, ABT263 or Obatoclax. Synergy was assessed by calculation of CI values.
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used for gene silencing and mechanistic
studies. In vivo experiments were performed in a glioblastoma xenograft model.
Single treatments with JQ1 and OTX015 had only moderate effects on the reduction
of cellular viability. However, the combination treatment of BH3-mimetics along with
JQ1 or OTX015 resulted in a highly synergistic reduction of cellular viability in a
broad range of different model systems of malignant glioma. Similarly, knockdown of
c-myc sensitized glioma cells for ABT263 mediated cell death. The enhanced loss of
cellular viability in the combination treatment was mediated by activation of apoptosis
with dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase cleavage. The
combination treatment led to a modulation of anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members with an increase in pro-apoptotic Noxa mediated by ATF4. Small interfering
RNA mediated knockdown of Bak and Noxa protected glioma cells from ABT263/
JQ1 mediated apoptosis. Finally, the combination treatment of ABT263 and OTX015
resulted in a regression of tumors and a significantly smaller tumor size as compared
to single or vehicle treated tumors. Thus, these results warrant clinical testing for the
drug combination of BH3-mimetics along with bromodain protein inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, which in turn
block physiological cell death and consequently promote
unrestrained growth. Most notably, Bcl-2 family members,
such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, are expressed at high
levels in gliomas, rendering these molecules potential
targets for therapy. This has led to the discovery and
synthesis of a certain class of molecules, which are known
as BH3-mimetics due to their high affinity binding to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.
Amongst the oncogenic transcription factors c-myc
is known to regulate cell death and was considered

Glioblastoma and malignant gliomas remain
incurable diseases [1]. It is for that reason that new
therapeutic approaches need to be elucidated. It is well
established that malignant gliomas are one of the most
heterogeneous tumor entities. Therefore, many oncogenic
pathways are simultaneously active in one tumor [2].
The activation of these pro-survival pathways results in
dysregulation of apoptosis with high levels of inhibitor of
apoptosis proteins, such as XIAP, cIAP-1 and survivin,

ABT263 treatment elicits a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on LN229, T98G glioma cells and NCH644 stem cell-like
glioma cells in the presence of the c-myc inhibitor, JQ1. The CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ) was used
for the drug-drug interaction analysis including the calculation of the combination index (CI). A CI<1 was considered as
synergistic, a CI=1 as additive and a CI>1 as antagonistic.
for a long-time to be “undruggable” [3]. However,
Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal proteins (BET), such as
BRD2 and BRD4 were shown to modulate c-myc mRNA
and protein levels and therefore were identified as potential
targets to interfere with c-myc [4]. Very recently, BET
inhibitors, such as the thienotriazolodiazepines, JQ1 and
the derivative OTX015, were shown to suppress c-myc
expression at the level of transcription [5]. Consequently,
c-myc-dependent tumors, such as Burkitt-lymphoma
and its associated preclinical model systems display
marked sensitivity against BET inhibitors [6]. Aside
from hematological malignancies, solid tumors, such as
malignant gliomas, are sensitive to BET inhibitors as well
[5]. However, the anti-glioma activity of BET inhibitors
appears to be limited [5]. That’s why new combination
therapies need to be identified to enhance the efficacy of
BET inhibitors.
In this work, we identified a synthetic lethal
interaction between Bcl-xL and c-myc inhibition in
various model systems of malignant glioma, including
patient-derived xenograft and stem cell like glioma cells.
Notably, stem cell-like glioma cells display a remarkable
sensitivity to the drug combination of BET-inhibitors, such
as JQ1 and OTX015, and BH3-mimetics.

to proliferation assays (CellTiter-Glo®-assays). JQ1
displayed a dose-dependent response in all cell lines
tested (Figure 1A-1C). Notably, stem cell-like glioma cells
appeared to be more sensitive than established and patientderived xenograft cells. However, high concentrations of
10 μM of JQ1 did not result in complete growth inhibition,
suggesting that the effects of JQ1 might be enhanced
through the addition of another compound.

The combination treatment of ABT263 and JQ1
elicits synergistic anti-proliferative effects
Based on the fact that c-myc inhibition has an
impact on intrinsic apoptosis, we hypothesized that JQ1
and ABT263 [7] might synergistically act on tumor cell
growth. To test this hypothesis, established glioblastoma
cells (U87, T98G and LN229) cells were treated with
JQ1, ABT263 or the combination of both compounds.
After 72h, viability assays were performed. We found that
the combination treatment resulted in a potent reduction
of cellular viability in a statistically significant manner
(Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained in patientderived xenograft lines (GBM6, GBM14 and GBM39)
(Figure 1E) and in stem-cell like glioma cells (NCH644
and NCH421k) (Figure 1H and Supplementary Figure
1B). To prove that the combination treatment reduces
cellular viability of glioma cells in a synergistic manner,
we calculated combination index (CI) values for the
drug combination of ABT263 and JQ1 in LN229, T98G,
NCH421k and NCH644 cells. All concentrations tested
resulted in highly synergistic CI values (significantly
below 1) (Figure 1F-1H, Supplementary Figure 1B and
Table 1). We verified as to whether or not structural similar
compounds, such as OTX015, were capable of enhancing
reduction of cellular viability mediated by ABT263. Akin
to the effects of JQ1, the drug combination of OTX015 and
ABT263 was significantly more effective than OTX015 or
ABT263 alone (Supplementary Figure 1A).

RESULTS
Treatment with JQ1 elicits antiproliferative
activity in glioblastoma cells
In order to assess the effects of JQ1 on the
proliferation of glioblastoma cells, we treated established
glioblastoma cells of different genetic backgrounds (U87,
LN229 and T98G), patient derived xenograft cells (GBM6,
GBM14 and GBM39) and stem cell-like glioma cells
(NCH644 and NCH421k) with increasing concentrations
of JQ1 (Figure 1A-1C). After 72h, cells were subjected

assays, the combination treatment led to a significant
higher amount of DNA – fragmentation as compared to
single treatments and control (Figure 2A-2C). In order
to confirm that not only ABT263 synergizes with c-myc
inhibitors, we assessed also the effects on apoptosis
with another BH3-mimetic, Obatoclax. In agreement
with the results above, the combination treatment of
Obatoclax and OTX015 led to a significant enhancement
of apoptosis as compared to each drug alone (Figure 2D2F). To further support an apoptotic cell death, T98G and
GBM14 cells were treated in a similar fashion as above
and subsequently stained with annexin V and propidium
iodide. Similar to the DNA – fragmentation results, the
combination treatment led to more annexin V positive
cells as compared to single treatments (Figure 2G and
Supplementary Figure 2A).

results show that zVAD-fmk protects cells from DNA –
fragmentation induced by ABT263+JQ1 (Supplementary
Figure 2D), suggesting that apoptosis and caspases play a
role in the death mediated by the combination treatment.

The c-myc inhibitor, JQ1, regulates the expression
of Bcl-2 family members with down-regulation of
Mcl-1 and up regulation of Noxa
In order to provide an explanation as to why the
combination treatment of ABT263 and JQ1 enhances
apoptosis and caspase-cleavage, we hypothesized
that JQ1 might affect the levels of the anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in malignant glioma
cells. To this purpose, LN229, T98G, U87, NCH644
and GBM6 glioblastoma cells underwent treatment with
increasing concentrations of JQ1 for 72h (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure 3). Subsequently, the lysates were
analyzed for protein expression by western blotting. In all
cell lines tested, we found a dose dependent decrease of
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Bcl-2 was down in LN229, T98G and
GBM6, but no modulation was seen in U87 and NCH644
cells. The deubiquitinase Usp9X, which interacts with
and stabilizes Mcl-1, was not significantly altered by JQ1
in T98G, LN229, U87 and GBM6 cells, suggesting that
JQ1 mediated down-regulation of Mcl-1 is independent of
Usp9X. However, JQ1 suppressed Usp9X protein levels
in NCH644 cells. With regards to the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members, we noted a consistent increase of BIM
levels in all cell cultures tested. In contrast, Noxa was
modulated by JQ1 in a less consistent fashion with an
increase in T98G and NCH644 cells, a transient decrease
in LN229 and a dose-dependent reduction in U87 cells.
We were unable to detect baseline expression of Noxa in
GBM6 cells (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that
these cells might express relatively low levels of Noxa
under non-stressed conditions.

ABT263 and JQ1 as well as ABT263 and OTX015
led to enhanced dissipation of mitochondrial
membrane potential in glioma cells
Based on the hypothesis that ABT263 and JQ1
enhanced intrinsic apoptosis, we determined as to
whether or not the combination treatment of ABT263 and
JQ1 as well as ABT263 and OTX015 cause enhanced
dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. To this
purpose, T98G cells were treated with ABT263, JQ1 or
OTX015 or the combination and subsequently stained
with TMRE to assess mitochondrial membrane potential.
In agreement with earlier results on apoptosis induction,
the combination treatment of ABT263 and JQ1 as well
as ABT263 and OTX015 led to a more pronounced
dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential than
each compound on its own (Figure 2H and Supplementary
Figure 2B), suggesting that intrinsic apoptosis might be
involved.

The combination treatment of ABT263 and JQ1
elicits activation of effector- and initiator caspases

The combination treatment of ABT263 and JQ1
elicits an increase of Noxa protein levels

To determine if caspases are involved in the
combination treatment of ABT263 and JQ1, we assessed
cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP. T98G
cells treated with ABT263 and JQ1 displayed stronger
activation of initiator-caspase-9 and effector-caspase-3
(Figure 2I). In agreement with these findings, cleavage
of the DNA-repair enzyme PARP, which is specific for
apoptosis detection (89 kDa product) was enhanced in
the combination treatment, suggesting that activation of
caspases is part of the cell death mechanism (Figure 2I).
Similar results were seen in LN229 glioblastoma cells
(Supplementary Figure 2C). To demonstrate that caspases
are involved in ABT263/JQ1 mediated apoptosis, we
treated LN229 with ABT263+JQ1 in the presence or
absence of the pancaspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. Our

Next, we assessed the impact of the combination
treatment on the expression levels of the various Bcl-2
family members. While U87 cells show a mild increase
in Mcl-1 levels after treatment with ABT263 and JQ1,
LN229 and T98G cells revealed a suppression of Mcl-1
protein levels (at 24 and 48 h after treatment) (Figure 3B3C). The combination treatment led to a suppression of
Bcl-2 in U87, T98G and LN229 after 48h of treatment
(Figure 3C). Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were down in all cell
cultures tested (T98G, LN229, U87) at 48h (Figure 3C).
While BIM was up regulated only by single treatment
with JQ1, the combination treatment increased the levels
of Noxa in U87, LN229 and T98G cells at 48 h (Figure
3C), suggesting that Noxa might be a key player in the

earlier detected in T98G and U87 (already at 24 hours),
but was also finally appreciated in LN229 cells (48h).

likely contributes to the apoptotic effects of the drug
combination by interfering with Bcl-xL.

Knockdown of Bak and Noxa protects from
apoptosis induced by the combination treatment
of ABT263 and JQ1

The increase of Noxa protein mediated by ABT263
and JQ1 occurs at the levels of transcription
and is mediated by the Activating Transcription
Factor 4 (ATF4)

Since we detected an increase in Noxa levels by the
drug combination, we determined as to whether or not
Noxa is a key factor in ABT263/JQ1 mediated apoptosis.
To this end, we silenced the expression of Noxa by siRNA
in LN229, which was confirmed by immunoblotting
(Figure 4F). Suppression of Noxa protected from apoptosis
induced by the drug combination (p < 0.05) (Figure 4ED
and 4G). Given that Noxa acts on Mcl-1 and Mcl-1 avidly
binds Bak, but not Bax, it was pivotal to assess the role
of Bak in ABT263/JQ1 mediated cell death. To this
purpose, we silenced the expression of Bak in LN229 and
knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure
4F). LN229 cells silenced for Bak showed significantly
less induction of apoptosis induced by ABT263 and JQ1 as
compared to cells that were transfected with non-targeting
siRNA (p < 0.05) (Figure 4E and 4G).

Noxa is known to be up-regulated in response
to death stimuli at the level of transcription. To test the
hypothesis that ABT263 and JQ1 mediate an increase
in Noxa mRNA levels, we treated U87 and LN229 cells
with ABT263, JQ1 or the combination of both for 7
hours and analyzed Noxa mRNA levels. We found that
mRNA levels were increased in U87 and LN229 upon
treatment with ABT263 and JQ1 (Figure 3D). While in
LN229 cells ABT263, JQ1 and the combination of both
elicited an almost equal increase of Noxa levels, the
combination treatment showed the strongest increase in
Noxa mRNA levels in U87 cells (Figure 3D). Given that
we detected an increase in Noxa mRNA upon treatment
with ABT263 and JQ1, we tested the hypothesis that ATF4
is implicated in ABT263-JQ1 mediated up regulation
of Noxa levels. To this purpose, LN229 cells (mutated
TP53) were transfected with a non-targeting siRNA or
an ATF4 specific siRNA. After transfection, LN229 cells
were treated with the combination treatment of ABT263
and JQ1 for 7h. Knockdown efficiency of ATF4 was
confirmed in LN229 cells (Figure 3E). Compared to nontargeting siRNA transfected LN229 cells, ATF4-siRNA
transfected LN229 cells displayed a significant attenuation
of Noxa protein up-regulation upon administration of the
combination treatment (Figure 3E), suggesting that ATF4
is a major driver of Noxa protein levels.

Knockdown of Mcl-1 is sufficient to enhance
reduction in cellular viability mediated by
ABT263
Given that Noxa inhibits the anti-apoptotic activity
of Mcl-1 and the combination treatment of ABT263
and JQ1 led to a suppression of Mcl-1 protein levels,
we assessed the importance of Mcl-1 in ABT263/JQ1
mediated cell death. In this context, LN229 cells were
transfected with non-targeting or four siRNAs that
target Mcl-1 and subsequently treated with ABT263. In
the presence of ABT263, silencing of Mcl-1 led to an
increased reduction of cellular viability as compared to
non-targeting siRNA (Figure 4H), confirming that Mcl-1
is an important mediator of resistance towards ABT263.
Notably, the amount of Mcl-1 reduction appeared to
correlate with the sensitivity to ABT263 (Figure 4H-4I).

Specific knockdown of Bcl-xL enhances JQ1
mediated apoptosis and recapitulates the effects
of ABT263
Next, we confirmed specifically that Bcl-xL
inhibition is the main target of ABT263 in the drug
combination of BH3-mimetics and JQ1. To this purpose,
we utilized two Bcl-xL specific siRNAs and transfected
them into LN229 cells (Figure 4A-4D). Specific
knockdown of Bcl-xL was confirmed by immunoblotting
(Figure 4C). 48 h after transfection, LN229 cells were
exposed to JQ1 and subsequently analyzed for DNA –
fragmentation by flow cytometry. The effect on apoptosis
by both Bcl-xL siRNAs was enhanced in the presence
of JQ1 (p < 0.05) (Figure 4D), recapitulating the effects
of the drug combination (Figure 4A-4B). These findings
suggest that Bcl-xL is a pivotal factor in the drug
combination of ABT263 and JQ1 and that ABT263 most

Knockdown of c-myc mimics the effect of JQ1
or OTX015 and enhances ABT263 mediated
apoptosis
Given that JQ1 and OTX015 are major inhibitors of
c-myc [5], we hypothesized that these compounds enhance
ABT263 mediated cell death mainly by suppression
of c-myc protein levels. To verify this hypothesis,
we specifically knocked down c-myc protein by two
different siRNAs (Figure 5B and 5E). Knockdown of
c-myc was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 5B
and 5E). Silencing of c-myc (siRNA-1 and -2) enhanced

heterotopic model of glioblastoma

ABT263 mediated cell death as compared to non-targeting
siRNA (Figure 5A, 5C, 5D and 5F). These results and
the previous observation above that silencing of Bcl-xL
synergizes with JQ1 suggest that there is a synthetic lethal
interaction between c-myc and Bcl-xL inhibition. Finally,
we confirmed that JQ1 inhibits c-myc protein expression
in established glioblastoma cell lines (U87, T98G, and
LN229) as well as in stem cell-like (NCH644) and patient
derived xenograft cultures (GBM6) (Figure 5G). Notably,
c-myc protein levels are particularly high in stem cell-like
glioma cells (Figure 5G), which is in keeping with earlier
studies.

In order to assess as to whether or not the synthetic
lethal interaction between c-myc and Bcl-xL inhibition
can be utilized therapeutically, we employed a heterotopic
model of glioblastoma, using p53 mutated LN229
cells. Concerning c-myc inhibition, we chose OTX015
since this compound has entered clinical testing for
various malignancies. After tumors were established,
four treatment groups were formed that received either

DISCUSSION

vehicle, ABT263 (37.5mg/kg), OTX015 (37.5 mg/kg)
or the combination of both 5 days a week. Animals that
were treated with the combination treatment displayed
significantly smaller tumors than animals receiving
vehicle or single treatments (Figure 6A-6C). Moreover,
the combination treatment resulted in a regression of
tumors ((starting size (mean): 162.6 mm3; size at the end
of the experiment (mean): 74.6 mm3; tumor regression:
54%). Despite the significant anti-glioma in vivo efficacy,
the combination treatment did not result in any toxicity,
which is supported by essentially no weight loss in the
combination treatment group throughout application of the
drugs (Figure 6D). We also did not appreciate any clinical
signs, such as petechiae, that would suggest a medicationinduced impairment of coagulation. All in all, these results
suggest that our proposed treatment is efficacious and safe.

In this report we demonstrated that simultaneous
inhibition of c-myc and Bcl-xL causes synthetic lethality
in model systems of one of the most difficult to treat
malignancies, which is glioblastoma. We validated this
phenomenon both by siRNAs and by pharmacological
inhibition. Despite recent promising molecular findings
glioblastoma remains an incurable disease with a rapid
progression due to resistance to conventional therapies.
Therefore, our findings might provide a novel avenue of
treatment for this recalcitrant malignancy.
In order to target Bcl-xL and c-myc, we utilized
three drug compounds, two of which are in clinical
development. The first drug compound is the Bcl-xL
inhibitor, ABT263, which is an oral derivative of its

predecessor ABT-737 [8] and has reached clinical trials.
Early after its discovery, ABT-737 has been tested in
preclinical model systems of glioblastoma, which reflected
the fact that this compound is working most efficient when
administered in combination with other molecules [9].
Another member of this class of molecules is Venetoclax
[10] that received accelerated FDA approval recently [11,
12], albeit not for brain tumors. The major advantage of
this compound over the others is its improved tolerability
in terms of side effects, such as on coagulation [13]. The
lack of effect on coagulation can be attributed to the fact
that Venetoclax binds preferentially Bcl-2 and to a much
lesser degree Bcl-xL [14].
While ABT263 efficiently inhibits Bcl-xL, Bcl-2
and Bcl-w, it fails to bind Mcl-1 [11, 15], which is also
commonly up regulated in cancer cells [16]. Consequently,
Mcl-1 drives resistance towards BH3-mimetics and
therefore ways to counteract Mcl-1 are necessary to take
ultimate advantage of BH3-mimetic based therapies.
Therefore, research groups are trying to target Mcl-1
by multiple means, e.g. pharmacological compounds,
interference with Mcl-1 protein stability or inhibition
of Mcl-1 protein synthesis [17-23]. We found here that
pharmacological c-myc inhibition by JQ1 [24] decreases
Mcl-1 protein levels in multiple glioblastoma cell cultures,
including patient derived xenograft cells. Consequently, it
is anticipated that JQ1 and OTX015 might have an impact
on the sensitivity towards BH3-mimetics. Indeed, careful
pharmacological cell death synergism analysis displayed
low CI values, indicating a high degree of synergy
between ABT263 and JQ1. The combination treatment
displays remarkable activity against stem cell-like glioma
cells. This might be explained by the earlier findings that
stem cell-like glioma cells depend on c-myc signaling
for their growth, which is in keeping with our findings
that NCH644 and NCH412k stem cell-like glioma cells
displayed the highest sensitivity towards JQ1 amongst all
cell cultures tested. Therefore, c-myc targeting is likely to
hit the stem-cell niche in these neoplasms. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time that a synthetic lethal
interaction between ABT263 and thienotriazolodiazepines
has been shown in the setting of malignant glioma.
While thienotriazolodiazepines were tested in GBM
before, they have not been extensively evaluated in the
setting of drug combinations [5]. However, recently,
OTX015 was tested in glioblastoma model systems in
vitro and in vivo, demonstrated efficacy and was able
to penetrate the blood brain barrier [25]. Moreover,
OTX015 acted synergistically with mTOR inhibition and
Temozolomide. In this context, the combination treatment
of Temozolomide and OTX015 extended animal survival
significantly longer than each reagent by its own.
Our findings revealed that JQ1 elicited a dramatic
effect on Bim protein levels. Based on the literature, BIM
can be regulated by several pathways, including the JNK/
c-Jun/AP-1 pathway as illustrated in [26]. Bim is known
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to be capable of activating Bax directly [27], which in turn
induces intrinsic apoptosis. In all model systems tested, we
found a dramatic increase in Bim protein levels [28]. From
the present literature, it has been shown that Bim regulates
the sensitivity to BH3-mimetics [29]. In that context,
high levels of Bim and low levels of Mcl-1 were shown
to correlate with sensitivity to ABT263. In our study,
Noxa, another pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, was
regulated by JQ1 treatment. Especially, the combination
treatment of ABT263 and JQ1 led to a significant increase
in Noxa levels and knockdown of Noxa [30] by siRNA
rescued from the combination treatment of ABT263 and
JQ1. Similarly, knockdown of Bak was protective from
the combination treatment, suggesting that the therapeutic
approach depends not only on Mcl-1 itself, but also on its
interacting partners. The increase in Noxa was at the level
of transcription. One candidate that regulates Noxa levels
is ATF4 [31] and our results confirm the implication of
ATF4 in ABT263/JQ1 mediated up regulation of Noxa.
The impact of ATF4 on cell death remains controversial,
since some reports have suggested a pro-apoptotic,
while others favored an anti-apoptotic role [32-35]. Thus
far, it appears that the function of ATF4 on cell death
appears to be context dependent. Among its other roles,
ATF4 is part of the so called integrated stress response
and its mRNA translation is increased upon enhanced
phosphorylation of eif2α, which can be mediated by
the endoplasmic reticulum residing kinase PERK. An
important downstream effector of ATF4 is CHOP [36] and
in turn CHOP is known to regulate Bim protein levels.
A summary of the proposed mechanism of action by the
analyzed drug combination is shown in Figure 7.
Finally, we confirmed as to whether or not
combined c-myc and Bcl-xL inhibition is efficient in an
in vivo model system of glioblastoma. For this purpose,
we utilized two compounds that are in clinical testing,
ABT263 and OTX015. We preferred OTX015 over JQ1,
since the latter has poor pharmacokinetics and thus was
not considered to be a prime time candidate for clinical
testing. Our results indicate that the combination treatment
of OTX015 along with ABT263 leads to regression of
glioma xenograft tumors without induction of toxicity as
demonstrated by no significant weight loss in the treatment
group. These results warrant further testing and suggest
a reasonable safety profile for this treatment approach in
patients.
