ABSTRACT
Hypervascularity is one of the main characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). However, the mechanisms of angiogenesis in HCC remain controversial. In
this study, we investigate the role of Notch1 in angiogenesis of HCC. We found that
Notch1 expression was correlated with formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) and
expression of biomarkers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the tumor
specimens. Two HCC cell lines, HepG2 and MHCC97-H, with low and high Notch1
expression, respectively, were used to study the mechanism of VM formation both
in vitro and in vivo. It was found that MHCC97-H cells, but not HepG2 cells form VM
when they grow on matrigel in vitro. HepG2 cells gained the power of forming VM
when they were overexpressed with Notch1, while knockdown Notch1 expression
in MHCC97-H cells led to the loss of VM forming ability of the cells. Similar results
were found in in vivo study. High expression of Notch1 in HepG2 promoted xenograft
growth in nude mice, with abundant VM formation in the tumor samples. Moreover,
we observed Notch1 was associated with the EMT and malignant behavior of
hepatocellular carcinoma by analyzing clinical specimens, models for in vitro and
in vivo experiments. HepG2 presented EMT phenomenon when induced by TGF-β1,
accompanied by Notch1 activation while MHCC97-H with knockdown of Notch1 lost
the responsiveness to TGF-β1 induction. Our results suggest that Notch1 promotes
HCC progression through activating EMT pathway and forming VM. Our results will
guide targeting Notch1 in new drug development.

transarterial chemoembolisation and sorafenib are options
as the systemic chemotherapy. However, marginal anticancer effect and non-benefit in survival have been proven
by a number of clinical trials [3]. Therefore, elucidation
of new mechanisms underlying the disease progression
and identification of therapeutic targets could contribute
to improve the disease control.
VM, proposed by Maniotis in 1999, is a type of
vessel-like structures lined with high invasive tumor cells
instead of endothelial cells [4]. In the last two decades,
VM has been found to be present in various solid tumors
and participating in nutrition and oxygen supply [5]. Some

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth
most common malignant tumor with the third mortality
worldwide [1]. It is a highly vascularized tumor required
angiogenesis to grow, invade and metastasize [2]. Because
of the advances in technology and clinical practice,
survival yielded by resection has been improved in the
last three decades. However, approximate 70% cases are
detected with tumor recurrence in 5 years after resection
and most of these cases are present in the first 2 years
[3]. In patients who are not suitable for surgical resection,

studies have suggested that VM is a risk factor for the poor
prognosis in various malignant tumors such as prostate
carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, glioma as well as pancreatic
carcinoma [5]. EMT and stem-like differentiation are the
key events underlying VM formation [6]. In the process
of angiogenesis, various angiogenic modifying genes
and embryonic genes are significantly increased or
decreased [6]. Indentifying the change of these genes and
understanding their mechanisms of actions will uncover
new targets and provide anti-angiogenesis approaches in
cancer therapy.
Notch is an embryonic gene and plays important role
in cell fate decision during embryonic development [7]. In
endothelial cell dependent vascularization, Notch signal
cooperates with VEGF signal to construct a feed-back
loop which plays important role in keeping the balance
between vessel density and functions [8]. As an oncogene,
Notch1 was found increased in many kinds of malignant
tumors and associated with tumor cell proliferation,
invasion and metastasis [9]. Recent studies demonstrated
that Notch involved in the development of melanoma VM
and potentially promoted VM formation via regulating
NODAL signaling [10]. Results from another study
indicated that Notch1 was upregulated in metastatic HCC
and potentially involved in VM development in HCC [11].
However, the role of Notch1 in VM formation in HCC and
related mechanisms was unclear. This study was conducted
to explore the role of Notch1 in the development of VM in
hepatocellular carcinoma and its underlying mechanisms.

Notch1 and its target gene Hes1 were over
expressed in HCC tissues
To understand the expression of Notch1 and one
of its downstream target gene, Hes1, in HCC tissues, the
expression of Notch1 and Hes1 were investigated using
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 44 HCC specimens and
matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. All tissue slides were
digitally imaged and evaluated by Image Pro Plus (IPP,
Media cybernetics, San Diego, CA), to avoid subjective
bias. In the present study, all of the 44 tumor specimens
were found to have moderate to strong positive Notch1
and Hes1 staining (Figure 1A and 1B), while 27 out of
44 matched paraneoplastic specimens were identified
with only slight to moderate expression (Figure 1C
and 1D). The staining of Notch1 and Hes1 were shown
as a cytoplasmic pattern. As a target of Notch1, Hes1
expression was positively correlated with Notch1 in HCC
tissues (r=0.845, P<0.001, Figure 1G). In HCC tissues,
the median IHC score of Notch1 and Hes1 were 94.45
(10.25-175.08) and 49.77 (7.84-105.14), respectively.
As a control, the IHC score in non-tumor tissues were
54.33 (10.15-88.93) and 21.76 (2.25-66.81) respectively.
Significant difference of Notch1 and Hes1 were observed
between tumor and non-tumor tissues (P<0.001,
Figure 1E). To confirm the increasing tendencies of
Notch1 and Hes1 in HCC tissues compared with adjacent

non-cancer tissues, RT-PCR was performed in 12 matched
tumor and non-tumor tissues to evaluate the expression
in mRNA. As shown in Figure 1F, the results of RT-PCR
were in accordance with IHC. These results suggested
that Notch1 and its target gene Hes1 as oncogenes were
overexpressed in HCC tissues.

respectively. Successful overexpression and knock-down
of Notch1 were confirmed by GFP signal and Western
blotting (Figure 4C and 4D). Increased invasiveness
and capacity of tube-formation was achieved by Notch1
overexpression in HepG2 cells, while knock-down of
Notch1 in MHCC97-H cells destroyed their ability to
invade and form tube-like structures (Figure 4E and 4F).
These results suggested that Notch1 played important role
in VM formation in HCC.

Expression of Notch1 and Hes1 were positively
associated with VM in HCC tissues
In HCC tissues, basement membrane of blood
vessels could be visualized using PAS histochemical
staining while endothilal cells visualized by CD34
immunohistochemical staining. The PAS-CD34 double
staining showed VM as a channel-like structure with
negative CD34 and positive PAS staining (Figure 2A
and 2B). Among total 44 samples, VM was detected in
17 (38.64%) cases. Spearman correlation analysis was
further performed and the results indicated that Notch1
and Hes1 were positively correlated with VM (r=0.590,
0.568, P<0.001 and 0.001, respectively. Figure 2C
and 2D). These findings indicated that VM formation or
angiogenesis might be regulated by Notch1.

Notch1 expression was elevated in TGF-β1
induced EMT model
It has been well documented that acquisition of
mesenchymal phenotype of tumor cells from epithelial
cells is the key step during VM formation [12]. As such,
we speculated that Notch1 contributing to VM formation
is associated with EMT. In this study, a classic in vitro
EMT process was achieved by TGF-β1 treatment in
HCC cells. After maintaining in 15ng/ml TGF-β1 for
24 hours, HepG2 cells revealed significant changes in
the expression of EMT related biomarkers including
the increase of vimentin and the decrease of E-cadherin
(Figure 5A). Furthermore, morphological change of
HepG2 cells such as elongation and spindle-like shapes
were observed in 2-dimension cultural system (Figure 5B),
while tube formation was found in 3-dimension condition
(Figure 5C). Interestingly, we found that Notch1 and Hes1
were significantly increased in those TGF-β1 treated cells
(Figure 5D), suggesting a possible role of Notch1 in EMT
and consequent VM formation.

Aberrant Notch1 expression and presence of VM
indicated earlier post-operation recurrence
To distinguish high and low expression of
Notch1 and Hes1 in 44 HCC samples, ROC statistics
was employed to estimate the cut-points of IHC score.
As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, the IHC score of
Notch1≥80.67 and of Hes1≥39.19 were considered high
expression. In this study 27 of 44 cases were completed
with 5-year post-resection following-up. As shown in
Figure 3C, 3D and 3E, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed
that high expression of Notch1 and Hes1, and exhibition
of VM indicated earlier post-resection recurrence (median
time to recurrence 20.12, 20.58 and 15.17 months, P<0.01,
0.05 and 0.01, respectively). These findings indicated that
both increased Notch1 and presence of VM should be
considered as risk factors for poor prognosis of HCC.

Notch1 overexpression led to EMT in HCC cells
Because Notch1 and Hes1 were increased in HepG2
after treatment with TGF-β1, we next determined whether
overexpression of Notch1 promotes VM formation
via inducing EMT. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B,
overexpression of Notch1 in HepG2 cells induced the same
morphological transition as the description above and led
to the increase of vimentin expression and the decrease of
E-cadherin expression. On the contrary, MHCC97-H cells
with Notch1knock-down revealed significant decrease in
vimentin and increase in E-cadherin (Figure 6C). We further
assessed the TGF-β1 responsiveness in MHCC97-H cells
and it’s counterpart of Notch1 knock-down, including
the expression of Vimentin and E-cadherin and VM
formation ability. After stimulation with TGF-β1 for 24
hours, the ability of MHCC97-H to form VM was doubled,
while it’s counterpart failed to form VM (Figure 6E).
Treatment with TGF-β1 for 24 hours increase Vimentin
and decrease E-cadherin in MHCC97-H (Figure 6D).
However, MHCC97-H with Notch1 knock-down lost
the responsiveness to TGF-β1 induction (Figure 6D).
Collectively, these results suggested that Notch1 inducedVM formation is mediated by the EMT process.

Notch1 associated with invasiveness and VM
potentiality of HCC cells
It has been well known that VM normally formed
in highly invasive tumors [5]. The formation of VM
was investigated in two HCC cell lines, HepG2 and
MHCC97-H, that represent low and high invasiveness
respectively (Figure 4E). Firstly, we found that
MHCC97-H cells with high Notch1 expression exhibit
the ability to form tube-like structures while HepG2 cells
with low Notch1 expression failed to form such structures
(Figure 4A and 4B). To validate the role of Notch1 in VM
formation, two lentiviruses were utilized to overexpress
and knock-down Notch1 in HepG2 and MHCC97-H cells

in HCC tissues

and in vitro experiments, its biological effect on HCC
growth and VM formation was further examined using
nude mice harboring HCC xenograft. HepG2 and it’s
Notch1 overexpression counterpart (HepG2/Notch1+),
MHCC97-H and it’s Notch1 knock-down counterpart
(MHCC97-H/Notch1-) were subcutaneously injected into
the athymic BALB/c mice. The tumors formed by HepG2/
Notch1+ were larger and heavier than those formed by
HepG2 (Figure 8A and 8B). While the tumors formed by
MHCC97-H/Notch1- were obviously smaller and lighter
than those formed by MHCC97-H (Figure 8C and 8D).
CD34-PAS double staining indicated that more VM
structures were found in HepG2/Notch1+ and MHCC97-H
groups than those in HepG2 and MHCC97-H/Notch1groups respectively (Figure 8E and 8F). These results
indicated that Notch1 played an important role in HCC
growth and VM formation, manipulation on Notch1
expression could disturb the disease progression.

To further confirm the correlation between Notch1
and EMT signatures in patient’s samples, Vimentin and
E-Cadherin were examined with IHC. There were 12 cases
in this study detected with positive vimentin staining not only
in liver blood sinus but also in carcinoma cells (Figure 7A
and 7B). Correspondingly, E-cadherin was found decreased
in those specimens (Figure 7C). In the 12 Vimentin positive
staining cases, the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 were found
higher than those in another 32 cases with negative Vimentin
staining (Figure 7E). In addition, 11 out of 17 specimens with
VM structures were positively stained with Vimentin, while
only 1 out of 27 cases without VM show positive vimentin
staining (Figure 7F). These findings further suggested that
EMT might be associated with VM formation, while Notch1
potentially contributed to the process.

DISCUSSION

Manipulation on Notch1 expression influenced
HCC xenograft growth and VM formation

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most
common malignant tumors and the third-most common
cause of cancer-related death world wide, especially

Since the important roles of Notch1 in VM
formation have been demonstrated by clinical analysis

characteristics of this disease and predicts poor prognosis
[13]. However, the mechanisms of angiogenesis remain

controversial [14]. Angiogenesis, whether physiological
or pathological, is ‘switched on’ if the balance between
proangiogenic factors and angiogenesis inhibitors tilts

towards proangiogenic factors [15]. Sorafenib, the
inhibitor of angiogenesis was demonstrated to improve
survival in HCC patients [16, 17]. Although the outcome
of Sorafenib treatment was not satisfying, it implys that
angiogenesis was a meaningful target in drug development
for HCC.
To better understand the mechanism of angiogenesis
in HCC, we focus on the VM formation in HCC in
the present study. We employ two HCC cell lines,
HepG2 and MHCC97-H, with low and high Notch1
expression, respectively, to investigate the role of
Notch1 in angiogenesis and HCC progression. We
found that MHCC97-H cells, but not HepG2 cells form
VM when they grow in matrigel in vitro. Interestingly,
HepG2 cells gain the VM forming ability when they
were overexpressed with Notch1, while knockdown
Notch1 expression in MHCC97-H leads to the loss of
VM forming ability of the cells. Similar results were
found in the in vivo study. High expression of Notch1
in HepG2 cells promoted the xenograft growth in nude
mice, with more VM formation in the tumor speciemens.
The Notch signaling pathway regulates embryonic cell
determination and differentiation as well as postnatal
development [18, 19]. High Notch1 level has been linked
to poor prognosis in breast cancer [20], where Notch1

has been shown to induce EMT [21, 22]. In this study, we
observed that Notch1 was associated with the malignant
behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma by analyzing the
protein expression by IHC in the carcinoma specimens.
To further understand wheather Notch1 is associated
with EMT in regulating VM in HCC, we examined
EMT markers in HCC cell lines, both MHCC97-H and
HepG2. We found that Notch1 overexpression induced
expression of mesenchymal biomarker Vimentin and
suppressed expression of epithelial biomarker E-cadherin.
Notch1 induced EMT phenomenon is mediated mainly
by TGF-β1. MHCC97-H with high expression of Notch1
grows with VM formation when cultured in matrigel.
In contrast, HepG2 with low expression of Notch1
was not able to do so. Both in vivo and in vitro results
suggested that Notch1 expression was related to VM
formation and EMT biomarkers expression, indicating
that Notch1 promoted HCC progression through inducing
VM formation by activating EMT pathway. Increasing
evidences indicate that EMT is essential in the formation
of VM [12, 23, 24], which is consistent with our result.
In summary, we demonstrated that Notch1 promoted
HCC progression through VM formation induced by EMT
signaling. Our results will provide a rational for targeting
Notch1 for HCC new drug development.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

(Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA, USA )
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1 × 103
cells in 100mL medium were seeded on the top chamber.
The bottom chamber contained 10% fetal calf serum
medium. After incubation for 24 hours, non-invasive cells
were removed with a cotton swab. Cells that migrated
to the bottom surface of the membrane were fixed in
formaldehyde for 10 minutes, stained with 0.1% crystal
violet solution, and counted under a microscope.

All speciemens were fixed in neutral buffered
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Slides were cut at
5μm, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in graded
ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with
3% hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol for 10 minutes at
room temperature. Sections were washed with phosphatebufferedsaline (PBS), and then pretreated with citrate buffer
(0.01mol/L citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 minutes at 95°C in a
microwave oven. After nonspecific binding sites were blocked
by exposing them to 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 20
minutes, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C using a
series of antibodies (please refer to Table 1). Following this
incubation, the sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated
with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG for 20 minutes at 37°C.
The slides were then incubated with 3,3-diaminobenzidine
chromogen for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature and
washed with distilled water. Finally, the sections were slightly
counterstained with hematoxylin for 1 minute followed by
dehydration and coverslip mounting. PBS was used in place
of primary antibodies as negative controls.

Western blot analysis
Twenty micrograms of cell lysates were separated
on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and then transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. Specific monoclonal antiNotch1 (CST, SN: 4380, delution: 1:2000), monoclonal
anti-Hes1 (CST, SN: 11988, delution: 1:2000),
monoclonal anti-Vimentin (CST, SN: 5741, delution:
1:2000), monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (CST, SN: 3195,
delution: 1:2000) and monoclonal anti-β-actin (CST,
SN: 8457, delution: 1:4000) were used. HRP conjugate
immunoglobulin was used as a secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA, USA). West Pico chemiluminescent (Pierce) was used
as the substrate to visualize protein bands, which were
quantified using densitometric image analysis software
(Image Master VDS; Pharmacia Biotech). Normalization
was made against β-actin expression.

IHC Evaluation
All the slides were assessed by two independent
pathologists who were blinded with the study background
and outcomes. To quantify the IHC staining of Notch1,
Hes1 and E-cadherin, the slides were imaged digitally
with the same light exposure and evaluated by Image Pro
Plus (IPP), a digitalized IHC scoring program (Media
Cybernetics, San Diego, CA). For vimentin IHC staining,
because the target staining location was in cytoplasm or
cytomembrane other than microvascular wall, the staining
located in HCC cells agreed by two pathologists was
considered positive staining, conversely, it was considered
negative staining if the staining was in microvascular wall.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). First strand of
cDNA was synthetized with reverse transcription kit
(PrimeScript™ Synthesis kit, Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian,
China). RT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Premix
Ex Taq Kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China ) on an
Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, White Plains, NY, USA). The β-actin was
used as internal controlls. The experiment was performed
in triplicate. Primers for Notch1, Hes1 and β-actin were
described in Table 2. Data were shown as the fold changes.

Cell culture
The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line
MHCC97-H and HepG2 were purchased from Fudan
University (Shanghai, China). Huaman umbilic vein
endogenous cell (HUVEC) line was purchased from Zhong
Qiao Xin Zhou Biotech (SN: ZQ0113, Shanghai, China).
All the cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM, GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA). Media
contained 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, USA),
100U/ml penicillin, 100mg/ml streptomycin, and 2mmol/l
L-glutamine. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a condition
with humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Three-dimensional cultures
The following experiments were performed when cells
reach 70–80% confluence in cultures. A 24-well tissue culture
plate was used and every well was evenly coated with 200ul
growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA, USA), which was allowed to solidify at 37°C for 60
minutes, before cells were plated. The cell suspension was
added (1 x105 cells/well) on to the surface of the matrigel
and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Cells were photographed
using an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan).

Cell invasion assay
The invasive ability of HCC cells were measured
using 24-well transwell units with polycarbonate filters
(pore size, 8μm) coated on the upper side with Matrigel

In vivo tumor xenograft

PAS-CD34 dual staining

Five-week-old male athymic BALB/c mice were
used in the study, and maintained in a laminar flow cabinet
under specific pathogen-free conditions. The animal
experiments were approved by the Ethic Committee of
Yang Zhou University (Yang Zhou, JiangSu, China).
Cares were taken to minimize pains of the animals. HepG2
and its Notch1-overexpression counterpart, MHCC97-H
and its Notch1-knockdown counterpart were harvested
from subconfluent monolayer cultures by treatment
with 0.25% trypsin, and washed with PBS twice before
being resuspended in 100mL PBS. 1 x 106 cells were
subcutaneously injected into left armpit of nude mice.
Four weeks after molding, animals were sacrificed and
tumor weight was measured. tissues were fixed in formalin
for further experiments.

IHC staining was applied to perform CD34 staining.
The procedure was the same as above description in IHC
part. PAS staining was peformed using PAS staining kit
(SN: DG0005, Leagene Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing,
China). Brifly, after DAB reaction, sections were treated
with 0.5% periodic acid solution for 10 minutes and
rinsed with distilled water for 5 minutes, followed by
staining in Schiff solution for 15-30 minutes. After rinsing
with distilled water, sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared and mounted.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0
for Microsoft Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Continuous variables were expressed as the means ± SD and
were compared between groups by using the Student’s t-test.
Categorical variables were compared by using the Chi-Square
test. The Mann–Whitney test was for non-normal distributive
data. The analyses of time to postoperative recurrence was
calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method, the differences in
survival between groups were compared using the log-rank
test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Lentivirus mediated Notch1 overexpression and
lowexpression
Lentiviral vector carrying green fluorescent protein
(GFP) for Notch1 overexpression and lowexpression
were commercially constructed by Genechem Co.,
Ltd., (Shanghai, China). A total of 1 × 104 HepG2 or
MHCC97-H cells were suspended in 0.4ml complete
DMEM in a 1.5ml tube, then 0.1ml vector stock (2×107
IU/ml) was added and incubated at 37°C for 12 hours.
Infected cells were then transferred into a 25cm2 tissue
culture flask with 4ml of fresh complete medium and
incubated continuously. Transduction efficiencies
were evaluated at 72-hour after infection by counting
GFP positive cells under a fluorescence microscope
(Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) and further confirmed by
Western Blot.
