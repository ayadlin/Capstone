quite inefficient at targeting the elusive metastatic phenotype.
Genomic analyses of highly aggressive and less aggressive human
cutaneous and uveal melanoma cell lines have revealed the
complexity of this phenotype, with a plasticity close to that of
embryonic cells (3, 4). In particular, aggressive melanoma cells, but
not their poorly aggressive counterparts, can engage in a process
termed ‘‘vasculogenic mimicry’’ (VM). VM describes the ability of
these cells to express endothelium- and epithelium-associated
genes and form extracellular matrix–rich tubular networks that
mimic the pattern of embryonic vasculogenic networks (5, 6). Also
occurring in nonmelanoma tumors, VM coincides with poor
clinical outcome. Conveniently for biological investigation, VM
can be observed in vitro in three-dimensional cultures on Matrigel
or collagen matrices (7). This has allowed the identification of
some mediators involved in VM promotion (8), including ephrinA2, vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), focal adhesion
kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2),
phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and Nodal (4, 8, 9). In this
study, we wondered whether cyclic AMP, a second messenger
controlling many cellular processes with idiosyncratic responses
depending on cell type, could be a mediator of VM. The binding of
many hormones to cells, such as those involving G protein–coupled
receptors (GPCR), induces the activation of adenylyl cyclases that
produce cyclic AMP from ATP (10). Cyclic AMP binds to PKA,
which then phosphorylates several substrates involved in signal
transduction pathways. Among these, the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) cascade consisting of small GTP-binding
protein Ras/B- and/or C-Raf kinases/MAPK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)
and ERK1/2 (11). More recently, additional cyclic AMP targets, the
(guanine nucleotide) Exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic
AMP (Epac) Epac1 and Epac2, which mediate PKA-independent
cell responses, have been discovered (12, 13). Epac1 and Epac2 are
unique exchange factors of the small GTPases Ras–associated
proteins (Rap) 1 and 2, which become activated upon releasing
GDP and binding GTP. Initially Rap1 was considered an antagonist
of Ras signaling, but follow-up studies have shown that it induces
ERK1/2 stimulation or inhibition depending on cell type, mode of
activation, and cellular compartmentalization (11, 14). Epac
responses can, however, cooperate with PKA responses (12, 15),
The complex relationships between PKA and Epac effectors explain
why the cyclic AMP signal may lead to apparent contradictory
responses in different cell types. Recent lines of evidence indicate a
link between PI3K-dependent protein kinase Akt (PKB) activation
and both Epac and Rap1. Akt is a major effector of the PI3K signal
and the PI3K/Akt pathway is frequently altered in cancers (16).
Phosphatidylinositol 3,3,5-triphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] produced by
PI3K upon activation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and GPCR
binds Akt. This then allows the Akt-activating phosphorylation at
Thr308 by phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and at
Ser473 by a putative PDK2. Modulation of PI3K-dependent Akt

Abstract
Aggressive melanoma cells can engage in a process termed
vasculogenic mimicry (VM) that reflects the ability of tumor
cells to express a multipotent, stem cell–like phenotype.
Melanoma cell plasticity contributes to the lack of efficient
therapeutic strategies targeting metastatic tumors. This study
reveals cyclic AMP as a mediator of VM in vitro. In uveal and
cutaneous metastatic aggressive human melanoma cells, an
increase in cyclic AMP by forskolin, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or G
protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands such as adrenaline
and vasoactive intestinal peptide inhibited VM to different
extents. Although chemical modulators of protein kinase A
(PKA) had no effect, a specific pharmacologic activator of
Exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (Epac)
impaired VM. Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) activation
assays revealed that cyclic AMP–elevating agents induce a
PKA-independent activation of Epac/Rap1. Pharmacologic
inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/
2) activity abolished VM. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was PKAindependently inhibited by forskolin but not inhibited by
Epac/Rap1 signaling, PKA modulation, or GPCR ligands.
Furthermore, the forskolin also inhibited phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated activation of protein kinase Akt,
as monitored by Ser473 phosphorylation. The pharmacologic
activation of Epac and GPCR ligands slightly stimulated Akt, a
likely concomitant process of VM modulation. Collectively,
these data show that forskolin strongly inhibits VM through
PKA-independent activation of Epac/Rap1, PKA-, and Epacindependent inactivation of ERK1/2 and inhibition of PI3K/
Akt. The data also show that VM inhibition by GPCR ligands
involves mainly the Epac/Rap1-activated signal. Thus cyclic
AMP inhibits VM through multiple signaling pathways. [Cancer

Introduction
Melanoma originates from the malignant transformation of
melanocytes that reside in the basal layer of the epidermis and in
other anatomic regions such as the uvea of the eye. The current
approach to treating melanoma relies on prevention, early
diagnosis, and local management of the primary tumor (1, 2).
However, for later stages of the disease, therapeutic strategies are

Cyclic AMP Signaling in Vasculogenic Mimicry
for 5 min with 0.1% Triton-X100 and saturated for 10 min with 1% bovine
serum albumin. GST-RBD-RalGDS activation-specific probe (diluted 1:4 in
PBS) was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with cells. Specificity
of the GST-RBD-RalGDS/Rap1-GTP complex formation was ascertained by
omitting the activation-specific probe in some chambers. Cells were
incubated simultaneously for 2 h with a goat antibody against GST
(sc-34072; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the rabbit antibody against Rap1.
Alexa fluor 594–conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and
Alexa fluor 488–conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen) were
then added for 45 min. Nuclei were labeled with a 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole solution. Slides were observed by epifluorescence with the

signaling by Epac and Epac/Rap1 has been observed for various
cell responses and may be opposite to Akt signaling through PKA
(13, 17, 18). Finally, recent studies have proven that cyclic AMP
could mediate a physical association between Epac, Rap1, and
phosphorylated Akt (19, 20). The in vitro data presented in this
study define a novel role for cyclic AMP in the regulation of the
plasticity of aggressive melanoma cells shown by the VM
phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures, treatments, and observations. The uveal MUM-2B and
cutaneous C8161 aggressive human melanoma cell lines (a generous gift
from Dr. M. Hendrix, Children’s Memorial Research Center, Chicago, IL)
have been described previously (7). VM was initiated by seeding 2.5  105
cells on dried matrices produced with 13 AL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
diluted one-half on 15-mm glass coverslips. When indicated, 15 AL of rat tail
collagen I (4.1 mg/mL; BD Biosciences) were also used (21). For phenotype
observations, treatment with pharmacologic agents was carried out
24 h after cell seeding, when cells were just confluent and then renewed
daily. Cells were stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS; ref. 7) and VM
patterns were observed with an Olympus IX-70 microscope equipped with
the AnalySIS FIVE software (Olympus). For semiquantitation of VM pattern,
images were converted into gray levels and threshold of lighter, PASnegative zones, determined and used to calculate the PAS-negative area.
The PAS-positive area, accounting for tubular networks and isolated PASpositive cells, was calculated by subtracting the PAS-negative area from the
total microscopic field and expressed as a percentage of the latter. For the
same total field, the number of tube connections was also determined.
Student’s test was performed on at least five measures for each variable
collected from six different experiments.
For biochemical investigations, f5  106 cells at preconfluency were
switched to serum-free medium overnight before treatment for 15 to 20 min
with pharmacologic agents in serum-free medium. For double exposure to
agents, inhibitors H8, U0126, and LY294002 were incubated for 45 to 60 min
before and throughout the follow-up 15- to 20-min treatment with other
pharmacologic agents. All compounds were from Sigma.
Rap1 activation assay (‘‘Pull down’’). Cells at preconfluency were
serum-starved overnight, treated or not (control) for 15 min with
pharmacologic agents in serum-free medium, and lysed in 500 AL cell lysis
buffer as described previously (22). To pull down activated GTP-bound
Rap1, lysates were centrifuged and 740 Ag (f350 AL) of supernatant
proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4jC with 25 AL of glutathione-agarose
beads (Sigma) preloaded with glutathione S-transferase–tagged Rap-binding
domain of RalGDS (GST-RBD-RalGDS) and then processed as already
described (22) using an antibody against Rap1 (sc-65; diluted 1:200; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and an Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen). Total Rap1 amounts in clarified lysates were also determined.
The pGEX plasmid vector containing the GST-RBD-RalGDS sequence was
kindly provided by Dr. JL Bos and W Pellis, University Medical Center,
Utrecht, the Netherlands.
SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Protein concentration was
determined with the Quanti-Pro BCA kit (Sigma) on 10,000 g supernatants
from cells extracted in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 120 mmol/L
NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% NP40, 2 mmol/L activated
Na3VO4, 5 mmol/L NaF, and protease inhibitors. Proteins (100 Ag) were
analyzed by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies
as indicated in figure legends. Blots were then reacted with secondary
antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluor 488 (Invitrogen) for signal detection
with a phosphofluoro-imager (FLA 2000; Fujifilm).
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. For ‘‘in situ Rap1 pull
down,’’ MUM-2B cells cultured in 8-chambers Labtek slides (D. Dutscher)
coated with collagen I (0.6 Ag/mL) were serum-starved overnight and
treated for 75 s with pharmacologic agents in serum-free medium as
indicated in the Results section. After fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde
and incubation with 50 mmol/L NH4Cl for 5 min, they were permeabilized

Results
Cellular cyclic AMP elevation inhibits VM in vitro through
the contribution of an Epac-dependent signaling pathway. We
first raised the cellular cyclic AMP level with a mix of the direct
activator of most adenylyl cyclases, forskolin (10 Amol/L), and the
nonspecific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 100 Amol/L; F/I; Fig. 1A). The aggressive uveal
MUM-2B and cutaneous C8161 melanoma cells cultured on
Matrigel matrices were either untreated (control) or treated with
the mix for 2 days. Intracellular elevation of cyclic AMP clearly
inhibited the formation of VM in both cell lines. The effect was
reversible as the subsequent removal of F/I during 2 additional
days allowed VM to commence (Fig. 1A, third column).
In an attempt to semiquantify the morphologic observations, we
performed image analyses of MUM-2B VM networks by selecting
two variables. First, the surface of PAS-stained elements accounted
for both tubular network importance and the amount of cells
producing an intense extracellular matrix, a feature of commitment
to the expression of the VM multipotent phenotype (5, 7). However,
as this variable overestimates the amount of VM tubes, we
introduced a second one: the tube connection number. Because
multipotent phenotype-expressing cells can appear among an
aggressive cell population without necessarily being organized into
typical VM tubes, this variable accounts for a full-structured VM
network. As shown in Fig. 1D, such analysis revealed that F/I
induced a 73% inhibition of PAS-stained tubular structures and
cells and an 88% loss of connections, the net result being a total
impairment of tube formation (Fig. 1A).
To confirm that elevated intracellular cyclic AMP levels inhibit
VM, we used a cell permeable cyclic AMP analogue, the dibutyrylcyclic AMP (dbcA; 0.5 mmol/L), and GPCR physiologic ligands,
namely adrenaline (ADR, 0.1 Amol/L) and vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP; 0.01 Amol/L). All these agents led to a reduction and/
or inhibition of patterned vasculogenic-like network formation to
different extents in MUM-2B cells (Fig. 1B, Matrigel; Fig. 1D, 52.5–
92% inhibition of PAS-stained structures, 78–94% inhibition of
connections). Similar effects occurred with C8161 cells (data not
shown). Cyclic AMP–elevating agents (CAEA) also impaired VM
when the cells were cultured on collagen I matrix, as shown for
MUM-2B cells treated with F/I, ADR, and VIP (Fig. 1B, collagen).
However, on collagen, the VM pattern displayed much fewer tubes
and connections and was more heterogeneous between experiments, owing to an apparent greater dependence on local
variations of matrix thickness. Additionally, the effects of GPCR
ligands were less substantial. In subsequent experiments, we
therefore preferred to use Matrigel. Altogether, these morphologic
data provide evidence that cyclic AMP can regulate VM in vitro.

monophosphate (6Bnz; 50 Amol/L), an inhibitor of PKA, N-[2(Methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, (H8; 20 Amol/L),
and with the only known specific chemical modulator of Epac, the
activator 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-2-O-methyladenosine 3,5-cyclic
monophosphate (8CPT; 50 Amol/L; ref. 12). The concentrations
stated above were used throughout our investigations. As shown in
Fig. 1C and D, 6Bnz and H8 had no significant effect on the
promotion of VM in MUM-2B cells, whereas 8CPT led to the
disorganization and partial inhibition of VM tube formation (43%
of PAS-stained structures and 60% of connections). In the latter
case, impairment of VM was not as strong as that observed with
F/I, indicating that the Epac signal only partially contributes to the
VM process. 8CPT frequently induced a lightening of the PAS
stain (as did F/I), suggesting a lower extracellular matrix synthesis
(Fig. 1C, 8CPT). Although PAS-stained cell aggregates were still
observed, they were flat with reduced organization into tubes.
In addition, PKA modulators 6Bnz and H8 were ineffective at
reversing or modifying the inhibitory effect of F/I on VM (Fig. 1C,
second row). 8CPT added concomitantly with F/I induced a
possible additive or F/I-dominant inhibition of VM (Fig. 1C).
Similar observations were made with C8161 cells (data not
shown). These results suggest that an Epac-dependent but PKAindependent pathway partially contributes to the cyclic AMPinduced VM inhibition observed in forskolin-stimulated cells.
Cyclic AMP induces an Epac-Rap1 signal in MUM-2B
melanoma cells. Because Epac is a Rap1-specific guanine
nucleotide exchange factor, we hypothesized that Epac-Rap1
signaling may be involved in the impairment of VM by cyclic
AMP. Focusing on MUM-2B cells, we examined the levels of
activated, GTP-bound Rap1 using a pull-down assay with GSTRBD-RalGDS activation-specific probe. Kinetics experiments
showed that F/I induced a 3-fold increase in cellular basal level
of cyclic AMP within 10 minutes that remained constant over
40 minutes of stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S1). We then
decided to determine Rap1-GTP levels in cells stimulated for
20 min with, respectively, F/I and 8CPT, in the presence or absence
of the PKA inhibitor H8. As shown by the representative
experiment in Fig. 2A, although H8 did not affect levels of

Rap1-GTP, 8CPT induced an increase, thus demonstrating a Epaclinked Rap1 activation via a PKA-independent modality. The same
results were obtained with F/I, confirming that cyclic AMP-induced
Rap1 activation was mediated by Epac and not PKA. The PKAindependent nature of Rap1 activation was additionally supported
by the absence of modulation of the Rap1-GTP basal level by H8 or
6Bnz alone (Fig. 2A). As expected, dbcA increased Rap1-GTP
(Fig. 2B). The GPCR ligands a-melanocyte stimulating hormone
(aMSH; 1 Amol/L) and VIP also activated Rap1, although the signal
detected was less intense than with dbcA (Fig. 2B).
Direct visualization of the activated state of MUM-2B Rap1 was
next achieved by carrying out an in situ pull-down assay (see
Materials and Methods). Untreated control cells were characterized
by a (total) Rap1 fluorescent red staining throughout the cytoplasm
with a stronger localization close to the nucleus, likely within the
Golgi (Fig. 3, first row, left). Basal activated Rap1-GTP was scattered
all over the cytoplasm, as shown by the faint green labeling (Fig. 3,
first row, middle). Compared with unstimulated control cells, much
stronger fluorescent staining of Rap1-GTP pools could be observed
after 75 seconds after either Epac activation by 8CPT or increased
levels of cyclic AMP by F/I or dbcA (Fig. 3, second column).
Confirming the double-label microscopic observations (Fig. 3, third
column), confocal microscopy revealed that the increase in Rap1GTP mediated by Epac occurred for preexisting cytoplasmic pools
of Rap1 located outside the Golgi area (Fig. 3, insert).

ERK1/2 can participate toward the inhibition of VM by
forskolin but not by the GPCR ligands AMSH or VIP. To
investigate the possible role of ERK1/2 in VM inhibition by cyclic
AMP, MUM-2B and C8161 cells were challenged with U0126
(10 Amol/L), a compound that specifically inhibits MEK1/2, the
immediate upstream kinase of ERK1/2. Within 2 days, the U0126
induced a complete inhibition of VM in the MUM-2B cells (Fig. 4A,
U0126; Fig. 1D, inhibition of 81% PAS-stained structures and 91% of
connections). VM impairment by 8CPT was stronger in the
presence of U0126 (Fig. 4A, 8CPT+U0126), indicating either an
additive or dominant effect of U0126. As expected, when ERK1/2
was nonoperative, the concomitant modulation of PKA was
ineffective on the inhibited VM (Fig. 4A, 6Bnz+U0126, H8+U0126).
Similar results were observed with C8161 cells (data not shown).
These data show that if ERK1/2 is inhibited, VM is abolished.
To decipher the possible links between cyclic AMP-mediated
activation of Epac/Rap1 and ERK1/2-mediated inhibition of
VM, we monitored the phosphorylation (activated) status of
ERK1/2. Serum-starved MUM-2B cells were challenged for
20 minutes with F/I, 8CPT, H8, 6Bnz, or a combination of H8
with F/I or 8CPT. Figure 4B shows that F/I treatment inhibited
ERK1/2 basal phosphorylation, whereas 8CPT was ineffective. The
concomitant presence of the PKA inhibitor H8 did not alter the
phosphorylation status observed upon F/I or 8CPT treatment.
Indeed, neither modulator of PKA activity, 6Bnz, or H8, modified

the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in these cells (Fig. 4B). In additional
experiments, we observed no basal or F/I-induced phosphorylation
of C-Raf at the Ser259 residue (data not shown). In many cells in
which cyclic AMP inhibits ERK1/2, this site is phosphorylated by
PKA, resulting in C-Raf inactivation (11).
In conclusion, forskolin induces an inhibition of ERK1/2, which
is neither linked to Epac nor PKA (and likely not to C-Raf).
Furthermore, the modulation of ERK1/2 activity does not transduce Epac/Rap1 activation.
To determine whether physiologic GPCR ligands could modulate
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we exposed MUM-2B and C8161 cells for
20 minutes to either VIP or aMSH. To check for a possible
opposing effect of phosphodiesterases, we added IBMX in the set of
experiments related to C8161 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, neither the
GPCR ligands nor dbcA modified ERK1/2 basal phosphorylation in
either cell line (Fig. 4C).
Lastly, we checked for the cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation
of Thr599/Ser602 residues in the B-Raf activation segment of the
catalytic kinase domain. Indeed, B-Raf rather than C-Raf is operative
in the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway of melanocytic cells (11, 23). Figure 4D
shows that CAEA as well as Epac activation by 8CPT did not modify
basal Thr599/Ser602 phosphorylation of 62- or 95-kDa B-Raf isoforms
in MUM-2B cells. The PKA inhibitor H8 also showed no effect.
We first conclude that direct inactivation of ERK1/2 inhibits VM.
Second, forskolin inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a PKA- and
Epac-independent manner, whereas GPCR ligands and 8CPTactivated Epac are ineffective. Third, no PKA signal, involving or
not C-Raf is transmitted to ERK1/2 in these cells. Lastly, neither
CAEA nor activated Epac modify the basal phosphorylation of the
B-Raf kinase activation site.

PI3K/Akt signaling can participate toward the inhibition of
VM by forskolin but not by the GPCR ligands AMSH or VIP. We
wondered if the inhibition of VM by cyclic AMP could be mediated
in part by a PI3K/Akt signal. To this end, we raised cyclic AMP
levels in MUM-2B cells during 20 minutes in the presence of the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20 Amol/L). Akt activation status was
assessed via the detection of phosphorylated Ser473 and Thr308
critical residues. In addition, we examined the Ser241 phosphorylation of PDK1 which is required for enzyme activity (24). As a
control for cyclic AMP–mediated GPCR-dependent activation of
PI3K, we also evaluated the Tyr508 phosphorylation status of the
PI3K p85a subunit that depends on RTK activity (25). Figure 5A
shows that F/I inhibited basal Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, in
contrast to 8CPT. Although dbcA seemed to be ineffective, aMSH
and, to a lesser extent, VIP, slightly increased Akt phosphorylation
(as did ADR; data not shown; Fig. 5B). A positive control was
performed with ADR+insulin (ADR/INS) treatment, known to
induce a strong Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in other cell types
(Fig. 5A; ref. 18). For all the treatments, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002
abolished Akt Ser473 basal and induced phosphorylation, indicating that Akt activity was PI3K dependent.
Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 could not be detected, although
it was observed in cells challenged with ADR/INS (Fig. 5A). Indeed,
the latter treatment induced a considerably stronger Ser473
phosphorylation signal than those obtained with CAEA. Because

Cyclic AMP Signaling in Vasculogenic Mimicry

superfamily (26, 27) responsible for the tuning of cyclic AMP
biological responses.
Modulators of PKA neither modify the overall pattern of VM nor
the forskolin-induced VM inhibition. This suggests that PKA is not
a cyclic AMP mediator of VM. On the other hand, activation of the
cyclic AMP target Epac by 8CPT impairs VM to some extent.
Furthermore, forskolin induces a PKA-independent activation of
Rap1 as does 8CPT. All GPCR ligands as well as dbcA activate Rap1,
in contrast to modulators of PKA. Epac therefore represents a
target of cyclic AMP that contributes to the inhibition of VM
signaling. While Epac is associated with an increasing number of
functional responses (13), our data report for the first time an
additional role as a mediator of tumor cell plasticity.
Cyclic AMP has long been recognized as a messenger for the
ERK1/2 MAPK pathway (11). PKA, Epac, and their downstreamrelated targets Ras and Rap1 could all mediate ERK1/2 activity
through multiple signaling networks. Our study confirms that
inhibition of ERK1/2 abolishes VM as already mentioned by Hess
and colleagues (28). More precisely, we have found that forskolin
inhibits ERK1/2 in a PKA-independent manner in MUM-2B and
C8161 cells. ERK1/2 shows no modulation with 8CPT-activated
Epac, suggesting that forskolin-activated Epac/Rap1 cannot
transduce to ERK1/2 the inhibitory signal that causes VM
impairment. This observation is reminiscent of what occurs in
B16 mouse melanoma cells in which cyclic AMP activation of
Epac/Rap1 is not transduced into an activation of ERK1/2 (23). In
these cells, cyclic AMP activates ERK1/2 independently of Epac
and PKA, suggesting the participation of an as yet undefined
exchange factor(s) for Ras. Additionally, in melanocytic cells,
cyclic AMP cannot activate C-Raf, whereas Ras transduces a PKAindependent signal to ERK1/2 (11, 23). Although detailed
examination of C-Raf activation was beyond the scope of this
study, we observed an independency of PKA/C-Raf in the cyclic
AMP response because no Ser259 phosphorylation could be
detected in control or CAEA-treated MUM-2B cells (data not
shown). Indeed, in B16 cells, B-Raf transduces the Ras signal
induced by cyclic AMP to ERK1/2 (11, 23). In our cells, none of
the CAEAs modified Thr599/Ser602 phosphorylations in the B-Raf
activation segment. This might suggest that B-Raf does not
transduce the forskolin-inhibiting signal to ERK1/2. Similarly, no
modification of these phospho-sites was observed after activation
of Epac, which might suggest the uncoupling of Epac/Rap1 to BRaf. However, based on these experiments, we cannot definitely
rule out the possible involvement of B-Raf through other
regulatory phospho-sites such as the enzyme inhibitory residues
Ser365, Ser429, and Thr440.
As has been observed in other cells (11), forskolin inhibited
ERK1/2 in the cells tested here. This is in contrast however to that
occurring in B16 cells or some metastatic human melanoma cells
(29). However, in the latter cell types, the activation of ERK1/2 was
PKA-independent but Epac/Rap1-dependent. Notably, such activation was obtained not by the direct activation of adenylyl cyclase
and GPCR as in our study but upon stimulation of a RTK. Thus,
ERK1/2 modulation also depends on the primary receptors
involved. None of the physiologic CAEA used in our study was
able to modulate ERK1/2 activity, showing that ERK1/2 does not
mediate VM inhibition via GPCR. In contrast, ERK1/2 inhibition by
forskolin impairs VM. The mechanism of such inhibition remains
to be fully determined, although we have established that neither
PKA nor Epac/Rap1 are involved. Our data also indicate that the
mechanisms of VM impairment likely depend on the mode by

activity throughout the experimental conditions. As expected, p85a
Tyr508 phosphorylation remained unchanged upon treatments,
showing that Akt activation was mediated by class IB PI3K. Similar
results were obtained with C8161 cells (data not shown).
Altogether, these data show that in contrast to aMSH and VIP,
forskolin inhibits the PI3K/Akt module.

Discussion
In this study, we have found that cyclic AMP signaling mediates
in vitro the ability of aggressive melanoma cells to engage into VM,
an example of tumor cell plasticity. In uveal and cutaneous
melanoma cells, an increase in cyclic AMP by either pharmacologic
agents or physiologic GPCR ligands leads reversibly to VM
inhibition. However, predictive of the complexity of underlying
ligand-specific signal pathways, various GPCR ligands induce
inhibition of VM to different extents. Whereas forskolin shows
the strongest effect followed by ADR and VIP, aMSH causes a
variable and weak inhibition of VM, even in the presence of the
phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (data not shown). We hypothesize that these differences may be linked to the various adenylyl
cyclase isoforms (10) and to the large repertoire of the GPCR

independently of Epac and PKA, leading to VM abolition.
Furthermore, contrary to GPCR ligands, forskolin mediates the
inhibition of PI3K/Akt, which in turn contributes to VM
impairment. In this regard, the faint PI3K/Akt signal stimulation
obtained with 8CPT-activated Epac and GPCR ligands is in
apparent contradiction with VM inhibition. One explanation
could be that the slight PI3K/Akt signal is dominated by the main
Epac/Rap1 inhibitory signal induced by all CAEA. Another, but
not exclusive, possibility is that activation of PI3K/Akt relates to
concomitant cell responses, such as proliferation and survival (see
for example, ref. 33). On the whole, our results strengthen the
concept that cyclic AMP can switch on simultaneously multiple
pathways to mediate VM inhibition.
Aside its links with ERK1/2, PI3K and Epac, how might cyclic
AMP signaling relate to other mediators of VM? To our knowledge,
no experimental data are available, although some reports suggest
relationships between cyclic AMP and both VE-cadherin and
Nodal. Cyclic AMP, through an Epac/Rap1 signal, enhances
endothelial barrier properties via the redistribution of VE-cadherin
and a strengthened cell adhesion (see for instance, ref. 34). The
process seems to depend on endothelial cell origin, with cyclic
AMP even displaying possible opposite effects (see for instance,
ref. 35). Concerning VM inhibition by cyclic AMP, a possible change
in VE-cadherin properties remains to be established. On the other
hand, Yurugi-Kobayashi and colleagues (36) reported that under
vascular endothelial growth factor treatment, an activation of
cyclic AMP signal specifies vascular progenitor commitment into
arterial rather than venous endothelial cells, associated with an
increase in Notch-1 and Notch-4 gene transcription. Interestingly,
Hendrix’s laboratory reported that Notch-4 may preferentially
up-regulate Nodal expression in aggressive melanoma cells (37).
Activation of Nodal signaling supports VM and expression of the
VM plasticity marker VE-cadherin (38). It is enticing to
hypothesize therefore that, similarly to what occurs in endothelial

which cyclic AMP is elevated, as is found in other cells for different
biological responses. For instance, the adenylyl cyclase 9 isoform is
insensitive to forskolin (30), which may account for cytokine
production differences in Kupffer cells in response to either
forskolin or GPCR ligands (31). In addition, the cell compartmentalization of effectors, especially Epac and Rap1, plays an important
role. Wang and colleagues (14) have shown that upon elevation of
cyclic AMP, Epac activates a perinuclear pool of Rap1 that does not
result in ERK1/2 activation, whereas Epac activated by C3G
guanine nucleotide exchange factor localizes to the plasma
membrane, thereby stimulating ERK1/2. In this regard, our
in situ Rap1 activation assay shows that forskolin and 8CPT rather
activate cytoplasmic pools of Rap1 than focal pools at the plasma
membrane. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we observed
similar staining intensities of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in cells
challenged with GPCR ligands and in untreated cells (data not
shown). ERK1/2 was located in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus
but not at the plasma membrane. Forskolin induced an inhibition
of basal pools of phosphorylated ERK1/2, similar to that obtained
with U0126 inhibitor, without any particular relocation. These
observations are in agreement with the lack of ERK1/2 activation
by either of the compounds used in our experiments.
Several studies have shown in various cell types that cyclic
AMP activates Akt in an Epac- but not PKA-dependent manner
(see for examples, refs. 17, 18). In addition, PI3K has been
recognized as an important mediator of VM, because its
inhibition leads to VM abolition (32). In our cells, forskolin
inhibited Akt phosphorylation, whereas GPCR ligands acted as
stimulators. In light of our data, Fig. 6 represents a likely scheme
of events occurring for the inhibition of VM by cyclic AMP.
Forskolin and GPCR ligands both activate an Epac-dependent but
PKA-independent pathway that contributes directly to VM
inhibition and whose downstream targets remain to be identified.
Unlike GPCR ligands, however, forskolin also inhibits ERK1/2

Figure 6. Model for in vitro inhibition of melanoma VM by
cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP is produced by adenylyl cyclase
either activated by the pharmacologic agent forskolin or
after binding of physiologic ligands (aMSH, VIP, ADR) to
GPCRs. An increase in intracellular cyclic AMP results in
the inhibition of VM mediated by activation of Epac/Rap1
producing Rap1-GTP. This process is supported by the
use of 8CPT that binds exclusively to the cyclic AMP
primary target Epac resulting in Rap1 activation and VM
impairment. PKA is not involved in VM, as neither an
activator, 6Bnz, nor an inhibitor, H8, modify the VM pattern
and do not affect inhibition of VM by either elevation of
cyclic AMP level or 8CPT-activated Epac. Inhibition of
MEK1/2 (U0126) or PI3K (LY294002 ) independently
abrogates VM indicating central roles for ERK1/2 and
PI3K. Unlike GPCR ligands, forskolin inhibits ERK1/2
activity-related phosphorylation (pERK1 /2) and,
consequently, inhibits VM through the MAPK pathway.
Activated Epac and/or PKA are not involved in this process.
ERK1/2 upstream kinase B-Raf seems to be uncoupled
to Epac/Rap1 signaling and unable to transduce the
forskolin inhibiting signal to ERK1/2. Furthermore,
unlike GPCR ligands, forskolin inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling
(dephosphorylation of Akt-activating kinase domain, pAkt)
resulting in VM impairment. Thus, multiple signaling
pathways can mediate VM inhibition via cyclic AMP.

Cyclic AMP Signaling in Vasculogenic Mimicry

Conclusively, our study represents a new implication of cyclic
AMP signaling and Epac function in tumor cell plasticity. These
findings may help to define potential targets for the therapeutic
management of melanoma tumors.

cells sharing phenotypic markers with melanoma cells committed
to VM, cyclic AMP switches on Nodal signaling in these latter cells.
However, according to our results, the cyclic AMP–dependent
activation of a Nodal signal would result in the inhibition of VM, in
apparent contradiction with Hendrix’s findings. Several hypotheses
can currently be devised. As reported by Hendrix’s group, Nodal is
expressed at a high basal level in MUM-2B and C8161 cells (9, 38).
Therefore, an overstimulation of Nodal signal could be nonoperative, excluding Nodal from the cyclic AMP–dependent inhibition
of VM. However, activation of Nodal signaling in the embryonic
endothelium of transgenic mice expressing constitutively activated
Notch-4 leads to disorganized vascular networks (39). The data
might suggest either that Nodal regulation of vascular morphogenesis is different and even opposite to that of VM, or, similarly to
this in vivo model, that a possible cyclic AMP-mediated activation
of Nodal may contribute to the disapperance of VM networks.
Future investigations should clarify this point.
