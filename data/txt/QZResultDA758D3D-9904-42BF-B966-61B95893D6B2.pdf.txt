Abstract
Inhibition of constitutive active signaling pathways, which are
a characteristic phenomenon for many tumors, can be an
effective therapeutic strategy. In contrast, oncogenic transcription factors, often activated by mutational events, are in
general less amenable to small-molecule inhibition despite
their obvious importance as therapeutic targets. One example
of this is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), in which
specific translocations lead to the formation of the chimeric
transcription factor PAX3/FKHR. Here, we found unexpectedly
that the transcriptional activity of PAX3/FKHR can be
inhibited by the kinase inhibitor PKC412. This occurs via
specific phosphorylation sites in the PAX3 domain, phosphorylation of which is required for efficient DNA-binding and
subsequent transcriptional activity. Consequently, we show
that PKC412 exerts a potent antitumorigenic potential for
aRMS treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Our study suggests
that posttranscriptional modifications of oncogenic transcription factors can be explored as a promising avenue for
targeted cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(10):3767–76]

Introduction
Inhibition of aberrant signaling can inhibit tumor growth, and
since the success of Gleevec as targeted therapy for chronic
myeloid leukemia, the principle of specific targeting of aberrant
signal transduction pathways by small-molecule inhibitors is
thought to be a promising method to fight cancer (1, 2). This
approach seems especially suitable for tumors with aberrations in
upstream components of signaling cascades, cell surface receptors,
or cytoplasmic kinases. Thus far, it has not been applied to tumors
containing aberrations located at the end of signaling cascades,
such as transcription factors, for which fewer, if any, specific smallmolecule inhibitors are available. However, as transcription factors
represent the second most frequently mutated class of proteins in
tumors (3), the availability of specific inhibitory compounds
against this class of proteins would broaden the principle of
targeted therapy to many additional tumor types.
Rhabdomyosarcoma accounts for 5% to 8% of all pediatric
malignancies and is the most common soft tissue sarcoma
diagnosed in children (4). No targeted drug therapy is available
for this tumor thus far. Histopathologically, rhabdomyosarcoma is

subclassified into two major forms: alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
(aRMS) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (eRMS). Eighty percent
of the aRMS are characterized by specific translocations, involving
the NH2-terminal part of PAX3 or PAX7, which in the majority of
cases is fused to the COOH-terminal part of FKHR generating
chimeric transcription factors PAX3 (or PAX7)/FKHR. Overexpression of these translocation products is associated with a poor
prognosis (5). Hence, the 5-year survival rate of aRMS patients is
much lower compared with eRMS patients (6), and once
metastasizing, aRMS become resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, new therapeutic agents are
urgently needed.
Survival of translocation-positive aRMS cells is dependent on
continuous expression of the fusion protein, as down-regulation
(7, 8) or inhibition by competition (9) of PAX3/FKHR induces
apoptosis in aRMS cells. However, the technical complexity of their
application in vivo prevents a clinical implementation of such
methods up to now. Therefore, identification of other, clinically
applicable, mechanisms for PAX3/FKHR inhibition would be of
great interest.
In this study, we present evidence for a mechanism allowing
regulation of PAX3/FKHR activity by the kinase inhibitor PKC412
(10). PKC412 is an inhibitor of several kinases, including protein
kinase C (PKC), Akt/protein kinase B, c-Kit, FLT3, and fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR), and is being evaluated in phase II
clinical trials for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients (11).
As we show here, the drug can influence the phosphorylation status
of PAX3/FKHR and hence its transcriptional activity. Furthermore,
we show a potent antitumorigenic potential of PKC412 for aRMS
in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that controlling the
activity of oncogenic transcription factors by small-molecule
inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy against cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and pharmacologic inhibitors. Two aRMS cell lines (Rh4
and Rh30) and two eRMS cell lines (RD and Ruch-2) were used. The Rh4 cell
line was obtained from the St. Jude Children’s Hospital (Memphis, TN). The
Rh30 and RD cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). The Ruch-2 cell line was established in our laboratories
(12). For ectopic expression studies of PAX3/FKHR, 293T and NIH3T3 cells
were used (ATCC).
PKI166, CGP59326, NVP-ABG424-NX-4, and PKC412 were provided by
Novartis; rapamycin was purchased from Sigma.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay. Twenty-four hours after seeding in 96-well plates, cells (10,000 per
well) were treated with pharmacologic inhibitors in a volume of 100 AL
medium including 10% serum for 96 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays (Roche) were then performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells (106) were seeded in 10-cm dishes
and, 24 h later, incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors for 96 h. Floating
and adherent cells were then pooled, spun down, and resuspended in a
defined volume of medium. After diluting the cells 1:1 with 0.4% of trypan
blue solution (Sigma), alive and dead cells were counted.
Caspase-3 assay. Active caspase-3 was detected by the CaspGLOW Red
Active Caspase-3 Staining kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 3  105 cells per six-well plate were treated with
0.5 Amol/L PKC412 for 24 to 72 h, and then floating and trypsinized cells
were pooled, spun down, and incubated with Red-DEVD-FMK caspase-3
inhibitor for 45 min at 37jC. Cells positive for active caspase-3 were scored
by fluorescence microscopy.
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (13) using primary antibodies against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), FKHR (C20; 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (1:1,000; BD Transduction
Laboratories), actin (A2103; 1:1,000; Sigma), and Tetra-His (1:1,000;
Qiagen).
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence of cells plated on gelatincoated glass coverslips was performed as described previously (13) using a
primary antibody against Tetra-His (1:200) and an Alexa Fluor 488–labeled
secondary antibody (1:200; Invitrogen, Molecular Probes).
Purification of the PAX3 DNA-binding domain protein. The PAX3
part represented in the translocation product PAX3/FKHR (AA1-391 of
PAX3) was His tagged (NterPAX3His) and transiently expressed in 293T
cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed in a buffer
containing 50 mmol/L NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 300 mmol/L
NaCl, 10 mmol/L imidazole, 40 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L h-glycerolphosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1 complete protease
inhibitor mix including 1 mmol/L EDTA (Roche). After centrifugation of the
extract at 10,000  g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with
8 AL/mL 50% Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4jC. The Ni-NTA agarose
was then washed four times with a buffer containing 50 mmol/L NaH2PO4
(pH 8.0), 300 mmol/L NaCl, and 20 mmol/L imidazole and two times with a
similar washing buffer containing 50 mmol/L imidazole. The protein was
eluted with a similar buffer containing 250 mmol/L imidazole.
For some applications, the protein was desalted using a C8 reversedphase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (Brownlee
Aquapore RP-300, 2.1  100 mm; Perkin-Elmer).
Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Isoelectric focusing was performed on an
IPGphor electrophoresis unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to
standard protocols (14). Immobiline IPG strips with a nonlinear pH gradient
of 3 to 10 (Amersham) were used and the samples were applied on the
strips by in-gel rehydration. SDS-PAGE was carried out on a Protean II xi
system (Bio-Rad) with 40 mA/gel at 15jC. Gels consisted of 13% (w/v)
acrylamide with 2.7% piperazine diacrylamide as cross-linker. Proteins were
visualized by a long silver nitrate staining.
Enzymatic digestion and liquid chromatography matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis
of the peptides. The desalted protein solution was dried in a vacuum
centrifuge and redissolved in a solution containing 150 mmol/L Tris,
6 mol/L urea, and 6 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8). Ten microliters were then
incubated for 2 h at 37jC. Five microliters of a solution containing 0.5 Ag of
Lys C (Roche Diagnostics) and 45 AL H2O were added and incubated
overnight at 37jC.
Peptides were separated on a reversed-phase capillary HPLC column
(PepMap C18, 0.3  150 mm; LC Packings) and collected onto a 600-Am
AnchorChip target (Bruker Daltonics), using a Probot microfraction
collector (LC Packings), in 15-s intervals. Matrix solution (1.5 AL) was
added to each fraction. A 1:10 dilution of saturated HCCA (a-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in ethanol/
acetone 2:1 was used as matrix solution. Mass mapping was performed with
an Autoflex matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS; Bruker Daltonics). Phosphorylated peptides
were analyzed in the linear positive ion mode with delayed extraction
(60 ns), and the following voltages were applied: source, 20 kV; extraction,
18.80 kV; lens, 7.85 kV.

Protein analysis with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization MS. Electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS) was performed on a PE
SCIEX API 365 liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS system. Mass spectra
were acquired in the mass range of m/z 1,000 to 3,000 with step size of
0.1 (scan time, 6 s). Chromatographic separation was performed on an
Ultimate system (LC Packings) equipped with a Vydac C8 capillary column
(0.3  150 mm). The flow rate was 4 AL/min.
In vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. 293T cells were transfected
with NterPAX3His or empty vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells
were washed twice with phosphate-free MEM and then incubated for 6 h in
phosphate-free MEM supplemented with 80 ACi/mL [32P]orthophosphate
(GE Healthcare, Amersham). Thereafter, NterPAX3His was purified with the
help of Ni-NTA agarose. Purified proteins were Western blotted followed by
detection of 32P with a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics).
Transactivation assay. PAX3/FKHR or PAX3 constructs together with a
reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene downstream of PAX3 paired
domain or homeodomain DNA-binding sites [6CD19 DNA-binding sites
(15) or P3-binding site (16)] and a plasmid containing the lacZ gene were
transfected into 293T or NIH3T3 cells or electroporated into Rh4 cells using
the AMAXA system (Program O17, buffer R) in ratios ensuring measurement in the linear range of the assay. Similarly, a FKHR construct together
with a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene downstream of the
bim promoter (17) and a plasmid containing the lacZ gene was transfected
into NIH3T3 cells.
For measurement of effects of PKC412, cells were incubated 16 h after
transfection with PKC412 or DMSO vehicle for 24 h followed by lysis in
reporter lysis buffer (Promega). h-Galactosidase and luciferase activities
were determined with the corresponding assay systems (Promega).
Luciferase activity values were normalized with the h-galactosidase activity
values and values of empty vector controls were subtracted.
Mutagenesis. PAX3/FKHR mutants were generated using the GeneTailor
Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All constructs were sequenced for verification.
Silencing of PAX3/FKHR. Silencing of PAX3/FKHR by small interfering
RNA (siRNA) was performed as described previously (8).
Real-time PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed under universal cycling variables on an ABI 7900 instrument
using commercially available target probes and Mastermix (all from Applied
Biosystems, Applera Europe BV). Detection of PAX3/FKHR was achieved
using PAX3 forward (5¶-GCACTGTACACCAAAGCACG-3¶) and FKHR reverse
(5¶-AACTGTGATCCAGGGCTGTC-3¶) primers applying the fluorescent SYBR
green method (Applied Biosystems). Cycle threshold (C T) values were
normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Relative expression levels of the target genes among the different samples were
calculated using the DDC T method.
CIP treatment of NterPAX3His. Twelve microliters of purified
NterPAX3His or nuclear extracts of 293T cells overexpressing NterPAX3His
were incubated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) buffer alone, 10 units
CIP (Promega), or 10 units of CIP in the presence of 60 mmol/L EDTA and
4 mmol/L Na3VO4 as phosphatase inhibitors in a volume of 20 AL for 30 min
at 37jC. Reactions without inhibitors were stopped by adding 60 mmol/L
EDTA and 4 mmol/L Na3VO4.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) with biotinylated oligonucleotides containing a
homeodomain-binding site (5¶-TGATTGCGGTGCTAATTGATTAACTTCGCATACCTGAT-3¶) or a paired domain–binding site (5¶-CTGGAGGGTTCCTGGAGAATGGGGCCTGAGGCGTGACCACCGCCTTCCTCTCTGGG-3¶) was
performed as described previously (15). EMSA reactions were resolved in
6% DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen) followed by blotting onto nylon
membranes (Millipore). Oligos were detected using the chemiluminescent
nucleic acid detection module (Pierce).
Rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft studies. Rh4 or Rh30 cells (107) were
injected into the right flank of athymic CD1 nude (nu/nu) mice (Charles
River). When tumors reached a volume of 130 to 200 mm3, oral treatment
with PKC412 (100 mg/kg/d) or placebo for 15 d was started. Tumor
diameters (d 1, d 2) were measured thrice weekly using a digital caliper.
Tumor volumes were calculated with the following formula: V = (4/3)pr 3,

apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescin, Roche). Ki-67–

Results
Treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma cells with kinase inhibitors. Recent gene expression studies of rhabdomyosarcoma (18)
identified a series of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) with potential
oncogenic capabilities highly expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma.
Therefore, we tested a series of small-molecule inhibitors targeting
RTKs in comparison with the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin (19) for potential growth-inhibitory
effects on two aRMS (Rh4 and Rh30) and two eRMS (RD and Ruch2) cell lines, as assessed by MTT assay (Fig. 1A). Induction of cell
death by the different inhibitors was measured by trypan blue
exclusion assays (Fig. 1B).
In accordance with previous studies (19), rapamycin showed
growth-inhibitory effects for both aRMS and eRMS cells (Fig. 1A).
However, the effects for Rh4 and Ruch-2 cells were small and no
clear dose-response relationship was found within the tested
concentration range. Furthermore, no significant loss of cell
viability was observed (Fig. 1B).
PKI166 and CGP59326, known to block the activity of either both
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1) and ErbB2 or only
EGFR, respectively, affected neither cell growth nor viability
(CGP59326) or inhibited cell growth but without significant
induction of cell death (PKI166; Fig. 1A and B), suggesting

inhibition of proliferation rather than induction of cell death in
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.
The c-met inhibitor NVP-ABG424-NX-4 influenced cell growth in
all rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines moderately, except for RD cells
(Fig. 1A), in which a dramatic induction of cell death was observed,
suggesting that strong sensitivity to this drug was observed in one
cell line only.
Finally, PKC412 inhibited proliferation of the aRMS cells Rh4 and
Rh30 much more effectively than RD and Ruch-2 cells (Fig. 1A). In
addition, cell death was significantly induced only in aRMS and not
in eRMS cells (Fig. 1B).
Taken together, among the inhibitors tested, PKC412 showed the
most efficient and specific antiproliferative effect for aRMS cells.
Therefore, PKC412 was further characterized.
Therapeutically significant IC50 levels for PKC412 were only
achieved in aRMS cells (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether cell death
is due to apoptosis, we used an activated caspase-3 assay. As shown
in Fig. 2B, induction of caspase-3–dependent apoptosis dramatically increased in aRMS cells when treated with 0.5 Amol/L PKC412
for 24 to 72 h. In contrast, apoptosis was only marginally enhanced
in eRMS cells. This finding was confirmed by examining the
caspase-3 substrate PARP (Fig. 2C), which was cleaved as early as
4 h after incubation with 0.5 Amol/L PKC412 (Fig. 2B). Therefore,
PKC412 selectively induces caspase-3–dependent apoptosis in
aRMS but not in eRMS cells.
PKC412 influences the transcriptional activity of PAX3/
FKHR. aRMS cells are known to undergo apoptosis on silencing of
PAX3/FKHR by oligonucleotides (7) or siRNA (8).
Hence, we hypothesized that PKC412 might influence PAX3/
FKHR activity. In the absence of PKC412, ectopic expression of
PAX3/FKHR in 293T cells induces transcription of CB1, as
detected by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A). A mutation (N269A) within the

homeodomain of PAX3, specifically inactivating its homeodomain
DNA binding (16), prevents induction of CB1 transcription
(Fig. 3A) but not of the paired domain–dependent target gene
AP2b (data not shown; ref. 8). This strongly suggests that
activation of CB1 transcription in 293T cells is dependent on
PAX3/FKHR activity, confirming results of earlier studies (20).
Furthermore, specific silencing of PAX3/FKHR by siRNA in Rh4

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

cells reduced CB1 expression to <20% compared with control
(Fig. 3A). The transcriptional level of CB1 was therefore used to
monitor PAX3/FKHR activity in further experiments.
Surprisingly, in the presence of PKC412, PAX3/FKHR-induced
transcription of CB1 in 293T cells as well as endogenous mRNA
levels in Rh4 cells were inhibited (Fig. 3B). This inhibitory effect of
PKC412 was validated by transactivation assays using luciferase
reporter plasmids containing specific promoters for the paired
domain (6CD19) or the homeodomain (P3) of PAX3. In these
assays, PKC412 strongly reduced PAX3/FKHR-induced expression
of the reporter in both 293T and Rh4 cells (Fig. 3B).
To exclude that PKC412 mediates these effects via downregulation of PAX3/FKHR expression, mRNA and protein levels
were measured in transfected 293T and Rh4 cells. Surprisingly,
PKC412 incubation led to an increase of PAX3/FKHR on the mRNA
as well as on the protein level in 293T cells, whereas in Rh4 cells
PAX3/FKHR levels were only slightly influenced (Fig. 3C). Taken
together, these results suggest that PKC412 modulates the
transcriptional activity of PAX3/FKHR.
To evaluate which part of the fusion protein is target of this
PKC412 effect, we measured its influence on the activity of the
translocation product PAX3/NCOA1 (18) and on PAX3 and FKHR
alone. This approach showed that PKC412 inhibited induction of
CB1 by PAX3/NCOA1 as well as the transactivation activity of PAX3
very similar to PAX3/FKHR (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the transactivation potency of FKHR on a luciferase reporter driven by the
promoter of the FKHR target gene bim (17) was unchanged by
PKC412 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that it is the
PAX3 rather than the FKHR domain of the fusion protein that is
influenced by PKC412.
The PAX3 domain of PAX3/FKHR is phosphorylated at
multiple sites. We hypothesized that the kinase inhibitor PKC412
might affect potential phosphorylation sites within the PAX3
domain as a mechanism to reduce activity. We therefore searched
for phosphorylations within this domain directly using a Histagged form (NterPAX3His). Immunofluorescence of transfected
293T cells with an anti-His tag antibody confirmed that
NterPAX3His was localized in the nucleus, as known for full-length
PAX3/FKHR (Fig. 4A), which was not changed after incubation
with 10 Amol/L PKC412 for 24 h. NterPAX3His was then purified
from 32P-labeled 293T cells and tested for potential phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4B, a strong 32P signal was detected in the
NterPAX3His protein, showing that PAX3 is indeed a phosphoprotein. Analysis with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis further
supported this conclusion, as the purified NterPAX3His protein
appeared as mixture of several species with different isoelectric
points (pI), reminiscent of multiple phosphorylation sites in the
protein (Fig. 4B). Treatment of purified NterPAX3His protein or
nuclear extracts from 293T cells overexpressing NterPAX3His with
CIP reduced the ability of NterPAX3His to bind to oligonucleotides
containing a homeodomain-specific or a paired domain–specific
binding site (Fig. 4C), suggesting that phosphorylation influences
DNA-binding properties of PAX3.
LC-MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of Lys C–digested PAX3-His protein
revealed four (or probably five) phosphates in the peptide 186 to
216 (Fig. 4D). This peptide contains six serine residues (S187, S193,
S197, S201, S205, and S209) as potential phosphorylation sites
(Fig. 4D). Four of these six serine residues are conserved among the
PAX3 proteins from different species, suggesting irreplaceability for
proper function of PAX3 (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, in silico analysis
using different web resources revealed that these six serine residues

and the two flanking S180 and S222 have the highest probability for
being phosphorylated in PAX3 (data not shown).
Phosphorylation influences activity of PAX3/FKHR. To test
directly whether PKC412 influences the phosphorylation status of
NterPAX3His, protein purified from PKC412- and control-treated

293T cells was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As
shown in Fig. 5A, PKC412 induced a clear shift toward more basic
pIs. Furthermore, ESI-MS (Fig. 5A) as well as MALDI-TOF-MS (data
not shown) analysis of the same proteins revealed a PKC412
treatment–induced shift toward smaller protein species. These

Protein samples used for EMSA were preincubated with CIP buffer alone (lanes 1, 5, and 8), CIP (lanes 2, 6, and 9), or CIP in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors
(lanes 3, 7 , and 10), respectively. D, top left, MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the peptide 186 to 216 of PAX3. NterPAX3His was purified from NterPAX3His-transfected

results suggest that PKC412 affects the posttranslational modification of PAX3.
To test whether phosphorylation directly affects PAX3/FKHR
activity, we mutated the six serine residues individually into
aspartate to mimic phosphorylation. However, these single
mutations did not affect sensitivity of PAX3/FKHR toward
PKC412 (data not shown). Instead, mutation of all six serine
residues together into aspartate (PAX3/FKHR 6D) rescued, at
least partially, transcriptional activity of PAX3/FKHR (Fig. 5B, left).
As expressed protein levels of wild-type (wt) and mutated protein
were similar (Fig. 5B, right), this suggests involvement of more than
one of these sites in regulation of PAX3/FKHR activity. Additional
mutation of S180 into aspartate (PAX3/FKHR 7D) did not lead to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

a significant further increase in rescue (Fig. 5B), whereas mutation
of S222 led to complete loss of transactivation activity (data not
shown). In accordance with the behavior of the aspartate mutants,
also single loss-of-function mutations of the six serine residues into
alanine did not affect transactivation potencies (data not shown),
whereas multiple mutations decreased transactivation activity as
measured in transactivation assays using the 6CD19 reporter
plasmid up to f50% (Fig. 5C).
To test whether these phosphorylation sites are involved in
regulation of PAX3 DNA binding, we treated nuclear extracts of
293T cells transfected with wt NterPAX3His or NterPAX3His 7D
with CIP. EMSA experiments showed that, in contrast to wt
NterPAX3His, DNA binding of the mutant NterPAX3His 7D to

both paired domain–specific or homeodomain-specific oligos was
not influenced by CIP treatment (Fig. 5D, left). This suggests that
indeed phosphorylation influences DNA binding of NterPAX3His.
To test whether also PKC412 affects DNA binding of PAX3/FKHR,
EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts from PAX3/FKHRtransfected cells incubated with or without 10 Amol/L PKC412. As
shown in Fig. 5D (right), PKC412 treatment indeed decreases DNA
binding of PAX3/FKHR.
Taken together, we conclude that specific phosphorylation
positively influences DNA binding of PAX3, thereby modulating
PAX3(/FKHR) activity, which in turn can be influenced by PKC412
treatment.
Inhibition of in vivo tumor growth of aRMS xenografts by
PKC412. As kinase inhibitors are interesting molecules for
potential treatment of aRMS, we further investigated the effects
of PKC412 on tumor growth in vivo. Toward this end, Rh4 and Rh30
xenograft mice were treated daily by oral administration of PKC412
(100 mg/kg) for 15 days. In both xenograft models, tumor growth
was significantly inhibited by PKC412 (Fig. 6A). In Rh4 xenografts,
a complete suppression of tumor growth was observed, whereas in
Rh30 xenografts tumor growth was strongly decreased.
To further characterize the effect of PKC412 on xenografts, the
tumors were isolated and characterized. Tumor morphology was

determined by H&E stainings. Placebo-treated Rh4 and Rh30
xenograft sections (Fig. 6C, top row) both showed a high density of
actively growing tumor cells. In contrast, PKC412-treated tumors
showed a dramatic increase in extracellular material (Rh4
xenografts; Fig. 6C, bottom left) and/or necrotic areas (Rh30
xenografts; Fig. 6C, bottom right).
To quantify the influence of PKC412 on tumor cell proliferation
in vivo, tumor sections were immunohistochemically stained for
the proliferation marker Ki-67 and apoptotic cells were detected by
TUNEL staining. As shown in Fig. 6B, the number of Ki-67–positive
cells was decreased in both Rh4 and Rh30 xenografts after
treatment, whereas the number of apoptotic tumor cells was
dramatically increased by 4- to 5-fold in tumors isolated from both
Rh4 and Rh30 xenograft mice treated with PKC412.
In summary, PKC412 significantly inhibited tumor growth and
reduced numbers of actively dividing tumor cells while simultaneously increasing number of apoptotic cells in vivo.

Discussion
For rhabdomyosarcoma, the current treatment is still based on
conventional treatment regimens (surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy), which in the case of metastasized aRMS often fail.
Alternative treatment agents are therefore highly desired.

In an approach to find targetable pathways in rhabdomyosarcoma, we analyzed recent gene expression data of rhabdomyosarcoma biopsies (18) for the expression of kinases with a known
tumor relation and tested a series of kinase inhibitors against three
selected kinases (EGFR, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and
FGFR) in comparison with mTOR, which has been characterized
as target in rhabdomyosarcoma in vitro (19), for their ability to
specifically reduce the growth of different aRMS and eRMS cell
lines.
From all substances tested, PKC412 was found to have the most
promising antigrowth effect with specificity against the aRMS
subgroup. This compound induces very efficient apoptosis in
submicromolar concentrations, which is well below the steadystate plasma levels of 2 to 7 Amol/L, which were achieved in phase I
clinical trials with this substance (21). As these concentrations
were well tolerated by patients, our in vitro data provide a first
preclinical rationale for clinical studies of aRMS treatment.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

PKC412 is a derivative of staurosporine and was developed as
PKC inhibitor. Although being more specific when compared with
staurosporine, which is known to bind to a bulk of the whole
kinome (22), PKC412 was found to inhibit a wide range of kinases,
such as cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B, protein kinase A, c-src,
and KDR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), in
submicromolar concentrations (23). Based on these characteristics,
PKC412 has been successfully applied as inhibitor of different
oncogenic kinases in a range of tumors in vitro [e.g., as FGFR
inhibitor in myeloproliferative disorder or multiple myeloma
(24, 25), as Kit inhibitor in mast cell leukemia (26), or as Akt
inhibitor in myeloma (27)]. Its potential clinical use is most
advanced as FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of AML, for which
PKC412 is used in a phase II clinical study (11).
Mechanistically, we found an unexpected inhibitory effect of
PKC412 on transcriptional activity of PAX3/FKHR, an important
potential therapeutic target in rhabdomyosarcoma. This effect is

PAX3/FKHR Phosphorylation

based on several observations: induction of target gene transcription on ectopic expression in the nonrhabdomyosarcoma cell line
293T can be inhibited. In addition, in the aRMS cell line Rh4, the
endogenous transcription of these target genes is affected by
PKC412, albeit less pronounced. However, whereas 293T cells do
tolerate even 10 Amol/L PKC412, aRMS cells rapidly undergo
apoptosis on PKC412 treatment, thereby interfering with determination of target gene levels. In contrast, when using reporter
plasmid–based transactivation systems to measure PAX3/FKHR
activity, the effects of PKC412 in both 293T and Rh4 cells were
comparable, suggesting effective inhibition of PAX3/FKHR activity
by PKC412 also in Rh4 cells.
We found that the inhibitory effect of PKC412 on PAX3/FKHR
activity is, at least partially, based on modulation of phosphorylation sites in the PAX3 part of the fusion protein. Nevertheless, it
cannot be excluded that also other sites are influenced by PKC412.
Whereas phosphorylation of PAX2 (28), PAX6 (29), and PAX8 (30)
has been reported, phosphorylation sites in PAX3 have not been
identified thus far. However, an influence of PKC on the
transcriptional activity of PAX3 in presomitic mesoderm has been
suggested in recent work (31). Supporting this observation, we
found that PKC412 can inhibit activity of PAX3 in a similar manner
to PAX3/FKHR. The region encompassing phosphorylation sites in
NterPAX3His described here (peptide 186–216) is located in the
linker region between the two DNA-binding domains of PAX3.
Generally, phosphorylation events can regulate the activity of
transcription factors via several different mechanisms including
changes in subcellular localization, protein stability, DNA-binding
activity, and protein-protein interactions. As PKC412 did not
influence the nuclear localization of NterPAX3His and even
increased the expression level of PAX3/FKHR in 293T cells, we
exclude the first two mechanisms as relevant. However, we could
show that phosphorylation of the linker region influences PAX3
DNA binding via both the paired domain and the homeodomain.
This is in accordance with earlier findings showing an influence
of this region on the DNA binding of PAX3 (32).
MALDI-TOF analysis revealed that at least four of six serine
residues are phosphorylated in the peptide 186 to 216 of
NterPAX3His. Interestingly, only multiple but not single mutations
of these sites into aspartate reduced the sensitivity of the protein
toward PKC412, suggesting that a combination of several phosphorylated sites is necessary for full transcriptional activity of PAX3/
FKHR. Whether all or a combination of some of these sites is
involved in PKC412 sensitivity is under current investigation.
Furthermore, the fact that exchange of all the six serine residues
by aspartate did not completely protect from PKC412-mediated
inhibition of PAX3/FKHR suggests that, besides modulation of these
phosphorylation sites, other mechanisms regulating PAX3/FKHR
activity might be affected by PKC412.

Translocation-positive aRMS cells have been shown to highly
depend on the presence of active fusion proteins, as silencing of
PAX3/FKHR by oligonucleotides (7) or siRNA (8) very efficiently
induces apoptosis in these cells. This suggests that reduction of
PAX3/FKHR activity by PKC412 in aRMS cells may be, at least in
part, the responsible mechanism for induction of apoptosis.
However, taking into account its broad inhibitory spectrum, it
cannot be excluded that some of its proapoptotic effects in aRMS
cells are based on other mechanisms. As tumors have many, and
often overlapping, biological pathways they can use to grow and
resist death, inhibition of different signal transduction pathways in
parallel may be even more effective when compared with therapies
targeting specifically one single pathway (see ref. 33 for review).
Hence, inhibition of multiple signaling pathways by PKC412 could
be of clinical advantage. Furthermore, such multitargeted therapy
is thought to have an increased likelihood of sustained effectiveness due to the reduced probability for appearance of resistant
clones.
About one third of the known cellular oncogenes are
transcription factors (3, 34); therefore, these factors are highly
interesting targets for potential therapeutic interventions.
Unfortunately, the absence of a directly targetable enzymatic
activity complicates targeting of these factors. Experimental
approaches to inhibit transcription factors, such as antisense
nucleic acid approaches, are very useful in vitro, also in the case
of aRMS (7), but the technical complexity of an application
in vivo prevents routine clinical implementation for the moment.
As shown in our study, the use of small-molecule kinase
inhibitors influencing transcription factor activity could be an
alternative. As most of the f1,000 human transcription factors
are thought to be regulated by phosphorylation (35), the
principles shown here may be worthwhile to explore in
additional tumors addicted to oncogenic transcription factors
(e.g., Ewing’s sarcoma).
In summary, our data reveal a novel mechanism regulating
PAX3/FKHR activity and at the same time suggest PKC412 as an
interesting potential agent for the treatment of aRMS, providing a
preclinical rationale for clinical studies with this inhibitor in aRMS
patients.
