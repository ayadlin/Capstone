ABSTRACT
Alkylating agents are frequently used as first-line chemotherapeutics for various
newly diagnosed cancers. Disruption of genome integrity by such agents can lead
to cell lethality if DNA lesions are not removed. Several DNA repair mechanisms
participate in the recovery of mono- or bi-functional DNA alkylation. Thus, DNA repair
capacity is correlated with the therapeutic response. Here, we assessed the function
of novel water-soluble N-mustard BO-1055 (ureidomustin) in DNA damage response
and repair mechanisms. As expected, BO-1055 induces ATM and ATR-mediated DNA
damage response cascades, including downstream Chk1/Chk2 phosphorylation,
S/G2 cell-cycle arrest, and cell death. Further investigation revealed that cell survival
sensitivity to BO-1055 is comparable to that of mitomycin C. Both compounds require
nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination, but not non-homologous
end-joining, to repair conventional cross-linking DNA damage. Interestingly and unlike
mitomycin C and melphalan, MGMT activity was also observed in BO-1055 damage
repair systems, which reflects the occurrence of O-alkyl DNA lesions. Combined
treatment with ATM/ATR kinase inhibitors significantly increases BO-1055 sensitivity.
Our study pinpoints that BO-1055 can be used for treating tumors that with deficient
NER, HR, and MGMT DNA repair genes, or for synergistic therapy in tumors that DNA
damage response have been suppressed.

such as nitrogen mustard (N-mustard) derivatives (e.g.,
cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine,
bis-chloroethyl), nitrosoureas (e.g., BCNU), platinum
complexes (e.g., cisplatin), and mitomycin C (MMC)
usually cause interstrand cross-linking (ICL). This kind
of lesion blocks DNA replication and transcription. Thus,
DNA alkylating agents are highly cytotoxic and are widely
used as first-line adjuvant chemotherapeutics in treating
various cancers. However, using DNA alkylating agents
in chemotherapy has several drawbacks. This includes

INTRODUCTION
DNA alkylating agents are frequently used in
cancer chemotherapy. These agents are able to interact
covalently (alkylation) with DNA, by forming mono- or
bi-functional reactive intermediates. The mono-alkylating
agents, such as temozolomide, are capable of transferring
a single alkyl group to a DNA strand, resulting in DNA
miscoding, strand breakage, cell death, mutagenesis,
or carcinogenesis. The bi-functional alkylating agents,

a drug’s high chemical reactivity, resulting in the loss
of therapeutic efficacy due to hydrolysis or in reactions
with other cellular components [1, 2], lack of intrinsic
DNA binding affinity that leads to carcinogenicity or
bone marrow toxicity [3], and reduction of cytotoxicity
via DNA repair mechanism [4] and acquired drug
resistance (multi-drug resistance, MDR). Developing new
DNA alkylating agents to improve existing problems is
necessary to meet the clinical needs.
In vertebrates, different DNA repair machineries
are developed in cells that are activated by various
DNA-damage agents, and in turns protect against from
these agents induced DNA lesions. Tumors with certain
DNA repair gene deficiencies initially respond well to an
appropriate DNA-damaging agent, but eventually develop
resistance due to compensation by another DNA repair
pathway [5]. Despite many resistance mechanisms having
been discussed [6], the traditional chemotherapy regimens
based on combinations of multiple DNA targeting agents
are still currently most effective [7, 8]. One main reason
is that multi-drug combinations produce diverse types
of DNA lesions, overcoming rapid resistance to a single
DNA-damaging agent. Typically, cells respond to DNAdamaging agents by activating the DNA damage response
(DDR) pathway, which is a complex signal transduction
cascade initiated by damage sensors, involving both
transducers and effectors to maintain genome integrity.
Following DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) and the ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases act
as two major DNA lesion sensors. They phosphorylate
and activate the downstream effector checkpoint kinase
2 (Chk2) and 1 (Chk1), respectively, as a consequence
of cell-cycle arrest, resulting either in the restoration of
lesions or the elimination of unrecoverable cells through
programmed cell death [9].
Several DNA repair mechanisms have been
highly conserved throughout evolution. These
mechanisms include 1) direct enzymatic repair by alkB
homologs (ALKBHs) or by O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT), both of which can repair
alkylated single-stranded DNA and RNA [10], and
2) the repair pathways, such as base excision repair
(BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous
recombination (HR), and non-homologous end-joining
(NHEJ) [11]. For example, NER and HR are the most
recognized repair mechanisms in response to melphalaninduced (an N-mustard) DNA damage. It is known that
NER genes are required to remove N-alkylpurine adducts
[12–14], and an extension of ICL repair capacity through
an increase in HR and Fanconi’s anemia (FA) protein
expression was found to be involved in melphalan
resistance [15–17]. These data not only provide
information about the types of DNA lesions induced by
melphalan, but also suggest the therapeutic implications
of using the drug. Tumors with deficiencies in repair
proteins should be hypersensitive to the corresponding
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapy. For example, tumors with low or no
MGMT expression are highly sensitive to BCNU, which
predominantly produces O6-alkylation adducts and can be
removed by MGMT [10]. Therefore, understanding the
response of the DNA repair system to lesions induced by
DNA-damaging agent is critically important to the proper
use of this agent in treating appropriate tumors with
specific DNA repair gene defects.
Synthetic N-mustard BO-1055 has been previously
found to produce plasmid DNA cross-linking damage and
to exhibit anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo [18, 19].
In this study, we confirm that BO-1055 induces G2/M
and S checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells,
and that both HR and NER are required for the removal
of the DNA damage it induces, further supporting that
BO-1055 causes DNA-ICL damage just like most of
N-mustards do. For a comprehensive understanding of
the effectiveness of BO-1055, we also examined the other
DNA repair machineries, besides NER and HR, which are
required for BO-1055 damage. Intriguingly, cells lacking
MGMT activity, but not N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase
(MPG) or alkylated DNA repair protein AlkB homolog 2
(ABH2), were sensitive to BO-1055 treatment, revealing
an as yet uncharacterized activity. These results suggest
that the DNA repair process following BO-1055-induced
lesions requires the involvement of NER, HR, and MGMT
repair. These findings provide new insight into the clinical
implications of BO-1055 treatment.

RESULTS
Repair of BO-1055-induced DNA damage
requires HR and NER
As BO-1055 (Figure 1A) has been recognized as
a DNA-ICL inducer in vitro [19], we assessed whether
DNA repair pathways corresponding to the removal of
DNA-ICL are a required response to BO-1055 treatment.
It was reported that, when DNA polymerases were stalled
at the site of ICL during DNA replication, FANCD2
would be mono-ubiquitinated by FANCL, a FA-associated
E3 ubiquitin ligase that is required for the efficient
removal of ICL by homologous recombination repair.
An evaluation of the fold change of non-ubiquitinated
and mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 at the molecular level
is frequently adapted to monitor DNA-ICL damage [20].
As expected, the amount of mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2
(FANCD2-L) increased on treatment with BO-1055or
MMC (Figure 1B), suggesting that either BO-1055 or
MMC can induce chromosomal DNA-ICL that requires
the FANCD2-mediated DNA repair pathway. In addition,
as it has been reported that DNA-ICL can be repaired by
double-strand break repair (DSBR) and NER proteins
[21, 22], we examined whether cells were sensitive to
BO-1055 when DNA repair gene expression was knocked
down, or when carrying a DNA repair gene defect. To test

the involvement of DSBR, we compared the BO-1055
sensitivity in MCF-7 with the knockdown of key players
in HR and NHEJ, the repair protein Rad51 recombinase
(Figure 1C) and the DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit
(DNA-PKcs) (Figure 1D), respectively. We also knocked
down the key DSB-corresponding checkpoint proteins,
ATM (Figure 1E) and Chk2 (Figure 1F). The results show
that the silencing of the expression of Rad51, ATM, or
Chk2, but not DNA-PKcs, increases BO-1055 sensitivity,
suggesting that BO-1055 DNA-ICL processing might
produce DSB intermediates that require repair by HR,
rather than by NHEJ. The involvement of NHEJ was
also confirmed by pharmacological inhibition of DNPPKcs by selective inhibitor NU7441 that cells incubating
with NU7441 were more sensitive to doxorubicin but
not BO-1055 treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A).
A similar requirement of HR was also observed in Rad51
knockdown MCF-7 cells treated with MMC, which
produce DNA-ICL that are well known to be repaired
by the HR pathway (Supplementary Figure S1B). The
structure-specific endonuclease xeroderma pigmentosum
complementation group G (XPG) is an indispensable
core protein in the NER pathway, and it has been linked
to MMC lesion repair [23]. We knocked down XPG
expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA), to test
the involvement of NER, and the results showed that the
silencing of XPG expression increases cell sensitivity to
BO-1055 (Figure 1G), suggesting that NER is involved
in repairing damage caused by BO-1055. Moreover,
the UV24 cells, which are deficient in the xeroderma
pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB), another
protein involved in NER [24], were also sensitive to
BO-1055 when compared to parental AA8 cells (Figure
1H). The requirement of NER was also observed in XPG
knockdown MCF-7 and UV24 CHO cells treated with
MMC (Supplementary Figure S1C and S1D).

this phenomenon, and found that BO-1055 induced fewer
γ-H2AX nuclear foci than MMC (Figure 2C). As BO1055 was found to induce ATM/ATR-dependent DNA
damage checkpoint activation, we were interested in
understanding the consequence of BO-1055 exposure at
the cellular level. Flow cytometric analyses of the DNA
content showed that MMC was able to induce S-phase
cell-cycle arrest at dose of 5 μM for 24-hours of exposure,
and the S-phase population continually accumulated while
both the sub-G1 and polyploidy populations increased at
72-h. Even the same low dose of BO-1055 was found to
accumulate in cells at the S and G2/M phase following a
48-h exposure, and to persist for up to 72-h, suggesting
that BO-1055 and MMC have different ways to interact
with DNA. However, a high dose of 20 μM of BO-1055
led to a rapid accumulation of both the S-phase following
a 24-h exposure, while increasing the sub-G1 fraction
72-h later (Figure 2D, and Supplementary Figure S2A).
The annexin V/PI-double staining assay was performed
to characterize cell death. We found that 5 μM of MMC
increased average of the annexin V-single-positive early
apoptotic population from 11% to 26% following a 48-h
exposure, and to 28% at 72-h. This exposure period also
led to an increase average of a small portion of doublepositive late apoptotic cells from 3% to 12%; 5 μM of
BO-1055 caused a lesser effect, but significantly increased
the early apoptotic cell population from 9% to 24% at 72-h
(Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S2B). This result
suggests that treatment of MCF-7 cells with BO-1055
or MMC at a dosage of 5 μM, induces major apoptotic
death. However, a high dosage of MMC and BO-1055
at 20 μM rapidly increased the PI-positive MCF-7 cells,
suggesting that high doses of drugs causes the same
level of cell toxicity and induces major necrotic-like
death (Supplementary Figure S2C). The intensity of cell
death induced by BO-1055, and that induced by MMC,
as evaluated by the annexin V/PI-double staining and the
MTT cytotoxicity assays (Supplementary Table S3), are
mutually inclusive.

BO-1055 induces the DNA-damage response and
perturbs cell cycle progression
Alterations in the chromatin architecture lead to the
activation of ATM/ATR-mediated DDR pathways. As BO1055 has been reported to crosslink to plasmid DNA in
vitro [19] and requires NER and HR for repair, treating
cells with it should elicit the DNA damage response. To
confirm that, MCF-7 cells were subjected to BO-1055
treatment for 6-h. We found that the DNA damage-induced
phosphorylation of Chk1-S345, Chk2-T68, and as well
as that of ATM-S1981, increased in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2A). It was also confirmed that BO-1055
induced DDR in a time-dependent manner starting 6-h
following treatment early at 6-h (Figure 2B). However,
the dose response to BO-1055 at 20 μM seemed to less
effective than that to MMC at 5 uM, suggesting that BO1055 is not as efficient as MMC in inducing DNA damage
in MCF7 cells. We further analyzed the formation of
γ-H2AX nuclear foci, a DNA-damage marker, to confirm
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MGMT is required for BO-1055-induced DNA
lesions
As BO-1055 treatment led to DNA-ICL and DNA
double strand breaks, the bi-functional alkylation of BO1055 was explored; however, the ability of BO-1055 to
generate the other forms of DNA damage, i.e. monoadducts, has not yet been explored. BO-1055 treatment
has a different impact on cell-cycle distribution and
cell death, implying that some BO-1055 lesions are
different compared to those induced by MMC. To test this
presumption, we examined whether the cell sensitivity to
BO-1055 depends on MPG, a protein of the BER pathway
that repairs N7-guanine adducts induced by N-mustards
[25]. Knockdown of MPG expression in MCF-7 cells
by siRNAs was not sensitive to BO-1055 (Figure 3A).
This result was also confirmed by the knockdown of a

scaffold protein in the BER pathway, X-ray repair crosscomplementing protein 1 (XRCC1) [26], which was not
found to be sensitive to BO-1055 (Supplementary Figure
S3A). Comparing BO-1055 sensitivity between XRCC1proficient AA8 and XRCC1-deficient EM9 CHO cells
led to similar results (Supplementary Figure S3B). Our
results suggest that the BER pathway is not involved in
BO-1055 DNA damage repair. ABH2 is a demethylase,
primarily responsible to repair N1-adenine and N3-cytosine
DNA methylation [27]. Knockdown of ABH2 expression
by siRNAs did not alter BO-1055 sensitivity in MCF-7
cells (Figure 3B), suggesting that ABH2 is dispensable in
BO-1055 DNA damage repair. However, the sensitivity
to the mono-functional alkylating agent methyl
methanesulfonate (MMS) was significantly increased
in EM9 CHO cells (Supplementary Figure S3C) and in
cells in which MPG, ABH2, and XRCC1 expression was
knocked-down, respectively, by siRNAs (Supplementary
Figure S3D). These data suggest that lesions produced by
MMS, but not by BO-1055, require the ABH2 and BER
repair pathways; these two agents indeed cause differential
effects on genomic DNA. BO-1055 does not produce
significant N-alkyl modifications on DNA bases; it only
accounts for a small proportion of modifications, if any,
that are insufficient to cause cell death.
Given that MGMT is an O-alkyl-related DNA
methyltransferase that differs in its function from ABH2
and MPG in N-alkyl base lesions, the involvement of
MGMT in BO-1055 damage repair was examined. We
found that knockdown of the expression of MGMT by
siRNAs increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to BO1055 (Figure 3C), as well as that to BCNU (Figure 3D),
which has been recognized as a one of the DNA
O-alkylating agents, but not that to MMC (Figure 3E).
Comparable analyses were done in the presence or absence
of the MGMT inhibitor O6-BG. MCF-7 cells pre-incubated
with O6-BG at a 20 μM concentration also remarkably
enhanced the sensitivity to both BO-1055 (Figure 3F) and
BCNU (Figure 3G). This suggests that BO-1055 might
also introduce lethal O-alkyl DNA adducts in addition
to DNA-ICL, and that BO-1055 possesses both types
of DNA alkylating activities, which may help to delay
chemoresistance in clinical applications.

the DDR induction levels by BO-1055 and MMC were
comparable in HEK293T cells (Figure 4B), suggesting that
MGMT downregulation increases the cellular response
to BO-1055 damage. In high MGMT-expressing MCF7 cells, decreasing the MGMT expression significantly
modified the ATM/ATR-mediated DDR, in which the
Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation levels (Figure 4C) and
the γ-H2AX nuclear foci formation (Figure 4D) induced
by BO-1055 were increased. These findings support that
BO-1055 might introduce lethal O-alkyl adducts on DNA
(Figure 3C and 3F), which can be repaired by MGMT. By
contrast, when treating cells with melphalan, which is one
of the derivatives of N-mustard for clinical use in treating
cancers, the drug-induced DDR was not enhanced in
MCF7 cells that had been transfected with MGMT siRNA
(Figure 4E). Overexpression of MGMT in HEK293T cells
suppressed the BO-1055-induced, but not the melphalaninduced, DDR (Figure 4F). The survival effect of MGMT
knockdown in MCF-7 cells to different doses of melphalan
treatment was uncertain (Figure 4G). These data suggests
that MGMT participates in mediating the BO-1055induced DDR in our system. This in turn indicates that
BO-1055 can produce O-alkyl base lesions and can
possibly be repaired by MGMT. However, melphalan like
BO-1055 belongs to N-mustard compounds, but seems
unlikely to produce O-alkyl adducts on DNA.

Checkpoint inhibitors enhance BO-1055
sensitivity
Tumors have the ability to modify their repair
capacities through a variety of mechanisms, in order to
survive chemotherapy [28]. Inhibition of DNA-damage
checkpoints is a promising strategy in the sensitization
of cancers to chemotherapy; thus, we next investigated
the effects of checkpoint kinase inhibition on BO-1055
sensitivity. Pharmacologically, the pretreatment with
10 μM of the ATM inhibitor KU55933 [29] or the ATR
inhibitor NU6027 [30] clearly inhibited BO-1055-induced
Chk2 and Chk1 phosphorylation, respectively (Figure 5A).
The checkpoint suppression led to the cleavage of
procaspases and PARP1, as well as to a significant increase
in MCF-7 cell sensitivity, when treated with BO-1055
combined with KU55933 or NU6027 (Figure 5B and 5C).
Furthermore, BO-1055 sensitivity was also increased in
cells by applying a very low concentration of WYC0209
(Supplementary Figure S4), which is an ATR-specific
inhibitor that downregulates Chk1 phosphorylation and
FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination, in response to DNA
damage [31]. Therefore, BO-1055 was confirmed to
induce the ATM/ATR-mediated DDR, and simultaneously
inhibits either of checkpoints to further increase cell
sensitivity to BO-1055 treatment. While the in vitro data
is convincing, an in vivo xenograph model would be more
compelling evidence to suggest that combining BO-1055
and ATM/ATR inhibitors effectively decreases the survival
of cancer cells.

Inhibition of MGMT enhances the BO-1055induced DNA damage response
As DNA O-alkyl base lesions are mutagenic and
harmful to cells, the inhibition of MGMT should trigger
the DDR to retard cell cycle progression. As the DDR
induced by BO-1055 was found to be lower than that
induced by MMC, as shown in MCF-7 cells in Figure 2B,
we expected that different MGMT level in cells would
lead to differential BO-1055-induced DDRs. To test the
impact of the MGMT repair activity on the DDR, we
treated low MGMT-expressing HEK293T cells with BO1055 (Figure 4A) and found that, unlike MCF-7 cells,

DISCUSSION

stress and improper chromosome segregation. BO-1055
also caused replication stress but did not appear in high
DNA content in cell populations at same concentration.
This reflects that only a portion of BO-1055 forms ICL
damage at low concentrations, relative to MMC, and
that it was trapped during replication, together with the
other forms of damage. Of these types of modifications,
O-alkylated DNA bases will be recognized due to
mispairs, and ATR/Chk1 checkpoints will be activated
during DNA replication [33]. Our results suggests that
the intensity of DDR induced by BO-1055 correlates to
its MGMT expression status; BO-1055 induced DDR at
a lower intensity than MMC in high MGMT-expressing
MCF-7 cells, but induced the DDR at the same intensity
in low MGMT-expressing HEK293T cells. This implies
that the BO-1055 induction of DDR at a lower intensity
occurs because a proportion of BO-1055 lesions can be
repaired rapidly and efficiently in MGMT-expressing
MCF-7 cells. In other words, BO-1055 might produce
O-alkyl adducts which can be recovered by MGMT, but
not N-alkyl adducts that are recovered by the ABH2- and
MPG-dependent pathways.

BO-1055 is a DNA-ICL agent targeted to
proliferating cells
To overcome the insufficiency of clinically used
DNA alkylating agents, we previously designed and
synthesized various types of DNA-directed alkylating
agents, which displayed good pharmacokinetic profiles.
However, these conjugates are lipophilic and have poor
water solubility. Therefore, we recently prepared a series
of novel water-soluble N-mustard-benzene conjugates
bearing a urea linker. The benzene ring contains a variety
of hydrophilic side-chains (tertiary amino functions),
which enable the formation of water-soluble acid salts
[19]. Of these agents, the BO-1055 compound was found
to have a broad spectrum of antitumor activity and potent
therapeutic efficacy against human MX-1 (breast cancer),
PC3 (prostate cancer), HCT-116 (colon cancer), and U87
(glioma) cell lines in tumor xenograft models. In this
study, we investigated the effects of BO-1055 on DNA
lesions and the DNA repair system at the molecular and
cellular levels. DNA repair genes are the caretakers of the
genome. They have been recognized as tumor suppressors
and associated with the therapeutic outcome of anticancer
agents [32]. As a consequence of lack in timely
completion of DNA repair, severe DNA lesions would lead
to cell death. Therefore, the lesion spectrum and repair
mechanisms of BO-1055 could be examined by comparing
the drug sensitivity among cells with different levels of
expression of DNA repair genes. On the other hand,
BO-1055 and MMC treatment can cause both apoptoticlike and necrotic-like death, depending on the drug
concentration, assessed by annexin V/PI living staining,
such that the time required to increase the polyploidy
nuclei cells is parallel to that required to increase the PI
permeable cells. This implies that MMC and BO-1055
induce fatal polyploidy leading to necrotic-like death.
The necrotic-like death of cells might reflect that mitotic
catastrophe was significantly elevated following treatment
with high doses of MMC or BO-1055. As with MMC, our
results suggest that BO-1055 has a selective sensitivity
toward highly proliferative cancer cells.

Comparison with other nitrogen mustards
Biochemical studies have shown that melphalan
predominantly causes N-alkylpurine mono-adducts, result
in DNA-ICL [34, 35]. Evidence from cell based assays has
validated that the NER genes are involved in the removal
of melphalan-induced N-alkyl DNA adducts [12–14]. In
addition, melphalan resistance was positively correlated
with an increase in HR and FA protein expression levels
[15–17], suggesting that melphalan produces toxic ICL
damage and that cells might become resistant to melphalan
when they have acquired an excessive repair capacity. Our
results are consistent with previous reports that MGMT
protein expression levels do not alter melphalan sensitivity
[36, 37]. This confirms that the O-alkyl DNA adducts
might rarely be produced by melphalan. Overexpressing
MGMT in low MGMT-expressing HEK293T cells
predominantly decreases BO-1055-induced, but not
melphalan-induced, Chk1 phosphorylation, showing the
difference in the mechanism of action between BO-1055
and melphalan, and suggesting that BO-1055-insulted
cells might carry O-alkyl adducts into the DNA replication
phase, which is sensed by the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint
[10, 33]. From a repair system point of view, the types
of melphalan-induced DNA damage are similar to MMC,
but not to BO-1055. Our results demonstrate that BO1055, like melphalan, produces lethal N-alkyl adducts
and cross-linking damage to DNA, which are repairable
through the NER and HR pathways. Besides, BO-1055
might additionally produce lethal O-alkyl adducts on
DNA, which is repairable by MGMT. Our result suggest
that the action of BO-1055 is similar to that of BCNU, but
not to that of melphalan, showing that MGMT involves
in the repair of lesions. Although there is no evidence to

BO-1055 produces O-alkyl adducts in addition to
N-alkyl adducts
In this study, we found that BO-1055 induces
FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination reflecting the induction
of DNA-ICL lesions. Like MMC damage, when the
expression of the HR proteins such as ATM, Chk2,
or Rad51, or the NER protein XPG were respectively
decreased, it led to the sensitization of MCF-7 cells to
BO-1055 treatment. We observed that MMC treatment
increased the S-phase population and led to a following
increase in highly aberrant DNA content in MCF-7cells,
suggesting that MMC produces ICL leading to replication

MGMT, MGMT can recognize differential alkylation on
the O6 position of guanine [38–40]. As the multiplicity
of genotoxic adducts might be produced by N-mustards,
continuous biochemical study of the precise interaction
between BO-1055 and DNA is particularly important to
understand its mechanism of action.

factors. Therefore, the continuous development of
chemotherapeutic agents is critical due to the diversity
of tumors. DNA damage-based checkpoints and repair
activity determines the fate of cells to chemotherapy.
Our informative data on BO-1055 in this system offers
insights into the clinical implications of this compound in
personalized tumor therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ATM and ATR inhibitors are backup stratagems
to improve BO-1055 sensitivity

Cell culture and chemicals

DNA repair genes are frequently affected in
tumors, and become diagnostic markers to predict the
tumor response to chemotherapy [41–45]. Our study
clearly suggests that BO-1055 may be effective in the
treatment tumors with dysfunctional FA, NER, HR, or
MGMT proteins. Nevertheless, we assume that, as with
most chemotherapeutic agents, BO-1055 might have an
effective initial response but eventually be met with an
acquired resistance in complex tumors. Fortunately, when
a DNA-damaging agent requires multiple repair routes
to fix the damaged DNA, the time to develop resistance
to chemotherapy will be delayed. The requirement of
multiple repair systems is precisely a distinguishing
feature that renders BO-1055 beneficial for clinical use. As
previous reports have revealed that checkpoint inhibitors
can improve sensitivities toward DNA-damaging agents
[46, 47], targeting the drug responsive checkpoint kinases
is an effective strategy to overcome BO-1055 resistance.
We found that the sensitivity of cancer cells to BO-1055
was increased following a combined treatment with the
inhibitors of the DNA damage sensors ATM and ATR
kinases, suggesting that both ATR and ATM are important
in the repair of BO-1055-induced lesions in different
fashions. According to previous reports, ATM can be
activated during the DSBR [22], NER [48] and MGMT
repair [49] processes against lethal alkylating damage,
but the ATM inhibitor does not improve temozolomide
sensitivity when the tumor highly expresses MGMT
[50], this implies that temozolomide produces relatively
low amount of ICL than MGMT repairable O-alkyl
adducts on DNA. The ATR-dependent FA repair pathway
is required to repair DNA-ICL damage [51, 52], and
ATR and FA protein overexpression were found in
melphalan resistance, which can be overcome with an
ATR inhibitor, but not an ATM inhibitor [16, 53]. Here,
ATR and ATM indeed cooperated in their response to
chemotherapeutics in different tumor contexts. Further
studies, including xenograft animal test, will be helpful to
unravel mechanism underlying BO-1055 resistant and to
make decisions in the selection of checkpoint inhibitors,
to improve BO-1055 sensitivity in secondary tumors.
In conclusion, chemotherapy is recommended as
first-line treatment in many tumors. The responsiveness
to chemotherapeutics in the clinic will not last because
of tumor heterogeneity driven by intrinsic and extrinsic

Flow cytometry
Briefly, MCF-7 cells that had been cultured
overnight in a 60-mm dish were treated with the indicated
concentration of BO-1055 for different time periods.
To evaluate the cell-cycle distribution, the cells were
harvested and fixed with 95% methanol for 2 h. They
were then rehydrated in 1 × PBS buffer before the DNA
was stained with 10 μg/mL of propidium iodide (PI;
Invitrogen), with 100 μg/mL of RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich)
at room temperature for 30 min; the cells were protected
from light exposure throughout this procedure. The PI
intensity, reflecting the DNA content, was analyzed
using a LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC). For the measurement of
apoptosis, the harvested cells were immediately stained
with annexin V-FITC and PI, and subsequently analyzed
by an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
