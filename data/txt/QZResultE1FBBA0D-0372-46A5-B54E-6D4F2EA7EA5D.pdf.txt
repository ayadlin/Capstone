The widespread adoption of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the first-line treatment of patients
with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer has resulted in acquired tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance becoming a
ubiquitous clinical problem. The identification of specific mechanisms of acquired resistance has allowed a better understanding of
the biology and natural history of resistant disease, but is only now starting to impact treatment decisions. Strategies for managing
acquired resistance in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer are complex and must be adapted to the individual characteristics of each patient’s cancer. Although combination chemotherapy is the presumed standard of care for most patients, prospective trial data are lacking, highlighting the importance of offering patients participation in clinical trials in this setting. Emerging data
from trials of third-generation mutant-specific EGFR kinase inhibitors suggests particular promise with this class of agents. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have come to define a distinct population of
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cancers that harbor these EGFR mutations have been demonstrated
to possess profound sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),1-3 giving them a unique biology and natural
history.4,5 Numerous studies have now demonstrated that patients with advanced NSCLC harboring specific EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R) should receive first-line treatment with EGFR TKIs.6 These
agents exhibit minimal toxicity and are broadly active, with only 3% to 10% of patients exhibiting refractory disease with
frank progression while receiving TKIs.6-8
The initial responses achieved with either standard first-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib) or
recently approved alternative agents (icotinib, afatinib) are temporary and marred by the inevitable emergence of acquired
treatment resistance.6,7,9,10 The management of acquired resistance has thus become the central challenge in the treatment
of patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC. Herein we reviewed current knowledge regarding the definition of
acquired resistance, mechanisms of resistance, and the optimal management thereof.
Defining Resistance to EGFR Kinase Inhibitors

The development of acquired resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is both predictable and unavoidable. Importantly,
acquired resistance is distinct in both mechanism and management from primary treatment resistance. The latter refers to
a heterogeneous population of cancers lacking TKI sensitivity due to the absence of an EGFR mutation, a distinct biology
(eg, the presence of another oncogenic driver mutation), or due to the baseline presence of a secondary mutation lending
resistance (eg, EGFR mutation plus EGFR T790M); primary resistance is outside of the scope of this review but has been
reviewed recently elsewhere.11 In contrast, acquired resistance refers specifically to resistance that develops after initial
EGFR TKI sensitivity. Although a clinical definition of resistance was previously proposed that included nongenotyped
patients with progressive disease after initial EGFR TKI response,12 the widespread adoption of EGFR genotyping has

resulted in acquired resistance now loosely referring to
EGFR-mutant lung cancers with disease progression
occurring during therapy with an EGFR kinase inhibitor
after an initial period of response or stable disease.
Acquired resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is
believed to be initiated by the emergence of clones possessing genomic alterations conferring a survival advantage under the selective pressure of the TKI.13 The point at
which resistant clones emerge compared with the initiation of TKI therapy remains controversial, particularly
given technical challenges in detecting low-prevalence resistance mutations before TKI therapy.14 To the best of
our knowledge, no relationship has ever been demonstrated between the detection of a pretreatment resistance
mutation in a minor population of cells and the ultimate
acquired resistance mechanism. However, once resistant
clones emerge they eventually grow to predominate
and lead to clinically apparent disease progression
(Fig. 1).15,16
One proposed criteria for defining resistance to
EGFR kinase inhibitors has used radiographic disease progression as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.12 The use of these
criteria to define disease progression and thus acquired resistance has obvious use in the conduct of clinical trials.
However, caution must be applied when applying these
criteria to treatment decision-making in patients with
EGFR-mutant NSCLC with emerging acquired resistance. Patients with robust initial responses to EGFR TKIs
2290

may have minimal remaining disease, such that clinically
insignificant changes on imaging may meet RECIST criteria for disease progression despite indolent growth and a
lack of symptoms. Put differently, the determination of
resistance based on radiographic disease progression does
not necessarily suggest clinically significant disease progression and treatment failure.17 The key clinical challenge is thus determining the point at which the degree of
acquired resistance as manifested by radiographic progression has reached a threshold that warrants changing treatment. This important question is currently being
investigated by the ASPIRATION trial, which is prospectively studying continued single-agent erlotinib beyond
RECIST disease progression (NCT01310036).
Mechanisms of Acquired Resistance to EGFR
Kinase Inhibitors

Several molecular mechanisms have been elucidated that
are capable of triggering acquired resistance to EGFR
TKIs. For the purposes of this review, we will broadly
group these mechanisms into 3 categories based on the
degree to which each mechanism is potentially actionable
or affects clinical management.
It is important to note that pharmacokinetic failure
of EGFR kinase inhibitors constitutes a separate mechanism of apparent resistance that is not well encompassed
in this schema. This phenomenon has been described secondary to drug-drug interactions and smoking-related
effects on EGFR TKI metabolism, in which a patient with

disease progression may be able to respond to an increased
EGFR kinase inhibitor dose.18,19 Isolated central nervous
system (CNS) disease progression due to poor drug penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid represents another
type of pharmacokinetic failure, in which the blood-brain
barrier limits drug penetration to subtherapeutic doses,
allowing regrowth of EGFR-mutant disease (Fig. 1).
Clinically actionable resistance mechanisms

The EGFR T790M mutation is the most common mechanism of acquired resistance, and is found in 49% to 63%
of rebiopsies performed after resistance develops to EGFR
TKIs.20-22 The T790M mutation alters the affinity of
Cancer

August 1, 2014

EGFR for ATP, dramatically reducing the ability of firstgeneration and second-generation TKIs to compete for
binding.23,24 The presence of the T790M resistance
mutation thus confers a survival advantage to tumor cells
when subjected to the selective pressure of EGFR kinase
inhibitors. However, the growth kinetics of T790Mpositive tumor cells are inferior to T790M-negative
EGFR-mutant tumor cells in the absence of EGFR
TKI.15,16 This may explain, in part, the phenomenon of
both tumor flare noted at the time of cessation of EGFR
TKIs, as sensitive clones overgrow the resistant clones, as
well as subsequent re-response of these sensitive clones to
retreatment with the same TKI (Fig. 1).25,26

Review Article

Clinically, T790M-mediated acquired resistance often exhibits a distinctive indolent pattern of disease progression,13,15,16 and in some series has been found to be
associated with a favorable prognosis compared with
T790M-negative resistance.15,16 In what to our knowledge is one of the largest rebiopsy series published to date,
the presence of T790M was associated with a lower incidence of new metastatic sites, higher performance status,
and longer survival.15 Beyond its role as a prognostic
marker, the T790M mutation also has an emerging role as
a predictive biomarker given that early data regarding
novel third-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors have suggested high response rate (RRs) in patients with T790Mpositive lung cancers (Table 1).20-22,24,27-42
Small cell transformation is another discrete resistance mechanism found in a subset of cases of acquired resistance in which neuroendocrine histological features are
observed with the original EGFR mutation maintained.30
The clinical course of transformed disease has been difficult to study due to its rarity (3%-14%), but anecdotally
can be associated with aggressive behavior (Fig. 1). One
report found 3 of 5 patients with this type of transformed
disease responded to standard chemotherapy with the
combination of platinum and etoposide.21
Potentially actionable resistance mechanisms

The second genomic mechanism discovered to mediate
acquired resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors was amplification of the MET gene and associated overexpression of
the MET kinase.31,32 MET amplification bypasses reliance on the EGFR signaling pathway by alternatively activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
pathway via ErbB3 signaling. The prevalence of MET
amplification in recent clinical series has ranged between
5% and 11%,20-22 which is lower than the 20% prevalence noted in smaller early reports.31,32 Several MET
inhibitors have been developed and are now in clinical trials as both single agents and in combination with erlotinib
(Table 1).20-22,24,27-42
Two other highly targetable oncogenes, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and BRAF, have
also been identified as mediating acquired resistance in a
small subset of cases.33,36 Amplification of HER2 has previously been postulated as a mechanism of acquired resistance, and was recently identified by fluorescence in situ
hybridization in 3 patients in a rebiopsy series of 24
patients.33 Mutations in BRAF have been demonstrated
to confer acquired resistance in preclinical models and
have also been identified in a small number of patients (2
of 195 patients) in a recent rebiopsy study.36 Although
2292

these resistance mechanisms may be too rare for dedicated
clinical trials, currently trials of the pan-HER kinase
inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib are ongoing for
acquired resistance (Table 1),20-22,24,27-42 and synergy
between EGFR and BRAF kinase inhibitors is an area of
active investigation among patients with colorectal cancer.37 PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3kinase, catalytic subunit alpha) mutations have similarly
been demonstrated to confer gefitinib resistance in vitro
and were identified in a small number of patients (2 of 37
patients) in 1 rebiopsy series21; this has not been identified
in subsequent rebiopsy studies and the role of these mutations in acquired resistance remains controversial.20,22,34
Hoping to identify some synergy, early-phase clinical trials of PI3K inhibitors combined with erlotinib have
moved forward in patients with acquired resistance.43
Reactivation of ERK signaling through ERK amplification
has also been identified in preclinical studies as a resistance mechanism to third-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors targeting T790M and a trial combining selumetinib
and gefitinib currently is underway.35
Additional resistance mechanisms with targeted
agents in preclinical development

Several potential mechanisms for acquired resistance have
been identified in primarily preclinical studies and small
rebiopsy series including CRKL amplification, AXL kinase
overexpression, and increased levels of hepatocyte growth
factor.38-41 These preclinical targets, although promising,
are beyond the scope of the current article and have
recently been reviewed elsewhere.42
Managing Acquired Resistance to EGFR Kinase
Inhibitors

Much has been learned regarding the management of
acquired resistance since the early studies of TKIs in
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer.44,45 Before
EGFR kinase inhibitors, the only systemic therapies for
the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC were cytotoxic chemotherapies, drugs with modest efficacy and
significant toxicity that often necessitated discontinuing
treatment at the first sign of disease progression. In contrast, EGFR TKIs are given daily by mouth and have remarkable efficacy for EGFR-mutant lung cancer with
modest toxicity. These differences have altered the basic
balance between continued treatment versus treatment
cessation in patients with acquired resistance.
The first question posited at the time of apparent
disease progression must be whether a patient’s progression is clinically significant enough to warrant initiating a

Figure 2. Approach to the management of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung
cancer with disease progression during first-line therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is shown. Herein, a stepwise
approach that considers disease progression characteristics and clinical trial availability before initiating second-line chemotherapy is proposed. RT indicates radiotherapy; CNS, central nervous system.

new line of therapy (Fig. 2). Indolent, asymptomatic progression of existing metastatic disease, without the
involvement of new organ systems, is often observed
when acquired resistance initially develops.15 Continuing
treatment with a TKI beyond disease progression in this
context has been suggested to delay the need for chemotherapy.46 What is more, stopping treatment prematurely
may carry a risk of disease flare, particularly if immediate
treatment with systemic chemotherapy is not planned.
Disease flare causing hospitalization or death was noted in
23% of patients who withdrew from treatment with
EGFR TKIs for subsequent clinical trial enrolment in one
series.25
The next important issue to consider in patients
exhibiting disease progression is whether their disease progression is localized, and potentially controlled with palliative local therapy (Fig. 2). Isolated CNS progression on
TKI therapy may, in some cases, be due to limited drug
penetration into the CNS due to the blood-brain barrier.
Palliative radiotherapy (RT) followed by retreatment with
TKI has the potential to regain control of the disease;
in one series of 51 patients, an additional median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.2 months was
reported.47 If systemic control and prevention of flare is a
concern, it is also possible to continue EGFR TKI during
whole-brain RT (WBRT), which was demonstrated to be
safe in a phase 2 study of erlotinib plus WBRT.48 The
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0320 trial examined
the combination of erlotinib, WBRT, and stereotactic RT
in patients with NSCLC with limited brain metastases.
This study demonstrated an increased incidence of grade
3 to 5 toxicity (CTCAE) among those patients receiving

erlotinib and stereotactic RT and underscored the risk of
combining these strategies.49 Alternative strategies using
pulsed high-dose EGFR kinase inhibitors to overcome the
blood-brain barrier are currently investigational with variable rates of clinical benefit described in several series.50,51
Acquired treatment resistance may also manifest as
limited oligometastatic disease progression outside of the
CNS. Locally ablative therapies such as palliative RT can
certainly be beneficial in the context of symptomatic oligometastatic disease. However, whether the treatment of
oligometastatic disease with local ablation changes the
natural history of acquired resistance or improves longterm outcomes remains unclear. Uncontrolled studies
have described favorable outcomes in selected patients
with acquired resistance receiving aggressive surgery or
RT to focal sites of disease,47,52 but evidence from properly controlled randomized studies will be needed before
the broad adoption of this strategy.
One question to consider in a patient with progressive
disease while receiving EGFR TKI is whether rebiopsy may
be valuable (Fig. 2). Several large studies have shown
rebiopsy to be feasible to characterize the molecular mechanisms of resistance.20-22 Rebiopsy can provide prognostic
information given the favorable prognosis observed in 2
series with T790M-mediated acquired resistance.15,16
Furthermore, rebiopsy is particularly valuable when considering a clinical trial: if pathology shows small cell transformation, immediate chemotherapy makes more sense,
whereas the detection of specific resistance mutations outlined previously could steer a patient toward a trial of a
specific targeted therapy (Table 1).20-22,24,27-42 The importance of enrolling patients onto clinical trials for acquired

synergy, believed to occur through controlling the percentage of cells that remain TKI-sensitive.13 Indeed, to
our knowledge, the only published prospective trial of
chemotherapy for acquired resistance is a single-arm phase
2 trial of pemetrexed plus continued TKI with a RR of
26% and a median PFS of 7 months reported.56 A retrospective study of 78 patients receiving chemotherapy for
acquired resistance found an improved RR for those continuing TKI with chemotherapy (41% vs 18%), but there
was no difference noted with regard to PFS.54 The potential synergy of continuing EGFR inhibition when chemotherapy is initiated for acquired resistance is the subject of
the ongoing IMPRESS trial of the combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed with or without gefitinib
(NCT01544179).
Targeted Therapies For Acquired Resistance To
EGFR Kinase Inhibitors

genotypes in vitro is shown. The y-axis represents the relative
concentration that inhibits 50% (IC50) normalized to the IC50
against EGFR-sensitizing mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletion).28,58,63 Second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as afatinib are more potent against T790M than
gefitinib, but dosing in the clinic is limited by wild-type inhibition (and toxicity) at a relatively lower dose. Third-generation
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as CO-1686 and
AZD9291 selectively inhibit EGFR T790M well below the dose
at which wild-type EGFR is inhibited and have the potential
to yield reduced toxicity as a result.

resistance cannot be overemphasized, given that this is a setting in which to our knowledge no positive phase 3 trial has
ever been performed and the standard of care remains
loosely defined.
For patients with systemic disease progression and
no clinical trial available, cytotoxic chemotherapy is an
appropriate second-line therapy after failure of EGFR
TKI given the demonstrated efficacy of platinum-based
chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. However, to the
best of our knowledge, published data are lacking regarding the activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy after TKI failure. Two retrospective studies described RRs of 15% and
18% to chemotherapy using a variety of regimens.53,54
However, a recently presented Japanese study reported a
more favorable RR of 40% (95% confidence interval,
22%-58%) to carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab in
30 patients with acquired resistance.55 More data regarding this topic are needed. Many clinicians add cytotoxic
chemotherapy to continued EGFR TKI for patients with
acquired resistance based on preclinical work describing
2294

Targeted therapies for EGFR TKI resistance have been an
area of active investigation for nearly a decade; the earliest
studies, many of which were negative, have been reviewed
elsewhere recently.57 Herein we will focus on therapies
that currently are commercially available or under active
investigation (Table 1).20-22,24,27-42
Second-generation, irreversible, EGFR kinase inhibitors have been investigated as therapies for acquired resistance based on preclinical data suggesting increased
activity against models with EGFR T790M.58 To the best
of our knowledge, afatinib is the most studied drug in this
class, with its use in acquired resistance having been evaluated in the phase 2/3 LUX-Lung 1 trial. This study was
negative for its primary endpoint of overall survival (10.8
months vs 12 months; P 5 .74),59 but demonstrated a
statistically significant improvement in PFS (3.3 months
vs 1.1 months; P > .0001) and RR (7% vs 0.5%;
P 5 .007).59 Because afatinib inhibits wild-type EGFR
more potently than T790M (Fig. 3),27,58 it has been
hypothesized that EGFR-related toxicity impairs the clinical delivery of this drug at levels sufficient to block
T790M-mediated signaling. For this reason, a study of
intermittent high-dose afatinib currently is underway.
Dacomitinib is another irreversible pan-HER inhibitor
that has demonstrated promising activity in early studies
in resistant disease.60 It is interesting to note that both afatinib and dacomitinib have activity against the HER2 kinase and therefore could be active against resistance
mediated by HER2 amplification. The National Cancer
Institute of Canada Br.26 trial randomized 720 patients
who had developed disease progression while receiving
standard therapy to either dacomitinib or placebo,

including a preplanned EGFR-mutant subgroup with
acquired TKI resistance; the trial has reportedly failed to
meet its primary survival endpoint although the outcome
in the EGFR-mutant subgroup remains to be reported.61
Third-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors comprise
a particularly promising class of investigational drugs for
acquired resistance. These agents are structurally distinct
from first-generation and second-generation inhibitors
and were designed specifically to inhibit EGFR T790M
while sparing wild-type EGFR (Fig. 3).62,63 Several agents
of this class have entered phase 1 clinical trials, with the
most studied being CO-1686 and AZD9291, both of
which have demonstrated impressive responses in patients
with TKI-resistant disease. The CO-1686 study has
reported on 9 patients with T790M from the highest dosing cohort (900 mg twice daily), and 6 achieved a partial
response.27 The AZD9291 study reported on 34 patients
across all dosing cohorts (20-80 mg daily) and 15 achieved
a partial response, including 9 of 18 patients who were
positive for T790M and only 1 of 5 patients who were
negative for T790M.28 No significant reports of rash or
diarrhea have been noted, which is consistent with a lack
of inhibition of wild-type EGFR. Further studies of the
relative effectiveness of these agents among both T790Mpositive and T790M-negative patients will serve to elucidate the potential role of T790M as a predictive marker
for this new class of agents.
Another approach used to maximize inhibition of
EGFR signaling in acquired resistance has been the combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor with an EGFRtargeted antibody, a synergy that was initially discovered
through studies of genetically engineered mouse models.64 Although a phase 2 trial combining erlotinib and
cetuximab revealed minimal activity,65 preliminary results
of a phase Ib trial of afatinib and cetuximab in 60 patients
with acquired resistance revealed a 30% response rate and
a median PFS of 4.7 months,29 with grade 3 rash and diarrhea (CTCAE) noted in 18% and 7% of patients, respectively (Table 1).20-22,24,27-42 Responses were seen
regardless of T790M status. Preclinical work demonstrated that the combination of an EGFR antibody and a
covalent kinase inhibitor markedly reduced both EGFR
signaling as well as total levels of EGFR protein.64 Additional clinical trials with this regimen are currently in
development.
Several other combinations currently are under
investigation for acquired resistance, most commonly
adding a new targeted agent to a reversible EGFR TKI
(Table 1).20-22,24,27-42 Several studies are evaluating MET
inhibitors (either antibodies or kinase inhibitors) added to

an EGFR TKI, although to the best of our knowledge at
the current time none is limited to MET-mediated resistance. The heat shock protein 90 inhibitor AUY922 is
being studied in acquired resistance with response rates of
approximately 18% (12 of 66 patients) with the use of
AUY922 alone and 16% (4 of 25 patients) when combined with erlotinib.66,67 A phase 2 study currently is
ongoing randomizing patients with TKI-resistant disease
to AUY922 versus single-agent chemotherapy
(NCT01646125). The combination of an EGFR TKI
with the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 is also currently under
investigation, with toxicities including hyperglycemia,
rash, and diarrhea being reported.68 In general, these combination studies have included all patients with acquired
resistance (a molecularly heterogeneous population)
rather than focusing on a biomarker-enriched subset of
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers who are more
likely to respond.
Lastly, the use of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors for acquired resistance must be considered given the promising early data in
patients with advanced NSCLC.69 Recent preclinical data
have suggested that EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer
may preferentially use PD-1/PD-L1–mediated mechanisms to evade immune surveillance.70 To investigate
whether there might be synergy in EGFR-mutant lung
cancers, several phase 1 studies are currently or will
soon be combining EGFR TKI with PD-1 or PDL-1
antibodies (NCT01454102, NCT02039674, and
NCT02013219).
Questions Ahead

The coming year is expected to bring greater availability
of third-generation EGFR TKIs as clinical trial options
for patients with acquired resistance. This exciting therapeutic development raises an important drug development question: when planning a phase 3 trial for patients
with acquired resistance, what standard therapy should be
given to the control arm? To the best of our knowledge, a
single phase 3 trial has been performed for acquired resistance, the third-line/fourth-line LUX-Lung1 trial, and its
primary endpoint was negative.59 Some might consider
treating patients who develop disease progression while
receiving first-line TKIs as “second-line NSCLC” and
support a minimalist standard therapy such as singleagent pemetrexed. Others might consider these patients
to be platinum-naive and support an aggressive standard
therapy containing cisplatin or bevacizumab. Still others,
believing in erlotinib continuation after disease progression, might support erlotinib with chemotherapy as
2295

standard. This lack of a clear standard is certain to add
complexity to drug development in this space.
A second important question raised by the emergence of EGFR T790M inhibitors is how to incorporate
rebiopsy and T790M testing into the standard management of patients with acquired resistance. Although technically feasible at academic centers,20-22 rebiopsy for
molecular analysis creates technical and resource allocation challenges, particularly at community centers. Exciting technologies are emerging that may allow for the
noninvasive genotyping of cell-free plasma DNA, and
have been proposed as a potential replacements for either
initial EGFR genotyping or the subsequent identification
of the T790M resistance mutation.71,72 Such noninvasive
T790M genotyping has the potential to be implemented
more broadly than current strategies requiring biopsy
tissue.
