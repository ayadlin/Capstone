ABSTRACT
As a major contributor of chemotherapy resistance and malignant recurrence,
glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been proposed as a target for the treatment of gliomas.
To evaluate the therapeutic potential of quetiapine (QUE), an atypical antipsychotic,
for the treatment of malignant glioma, we established mouse models with GSCsinitiated orthotopic xenograft gliomas and subcutaneous xenograft tumors, using GSCs
purified from glioblastoma cell line GL261. We investigated antitumor effects of QUE
on xenograft gliomas and its underlying mechanisms on GSCs. Our data demonstrated
that (i) QUE monotherapy can effectively suppress GSCs-initiated tumor growth;
(ii) QUE has synergistic effects with temozolomide (TMZ) on glioma suppression,
and importantly, QUE can effectively suppress TMZ-resistant (or -escaped) tumors
generated from GSCs; (iii) mechanistically, the anti-glioma effect of QUE was due to
its actions of promoting the differentiation of GSCs into oligodendrocyte (OL)-like
cells and its inhibitory effect on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Together, our
findings suggest an effective approach for anti-gliomagenic treatment via targeting
OL-oriented differentiation of GSCs. This also opens a door for repurposing QUE, an
FDA approved drug, for the treatment of malignant glioma.

cells (NSCs) or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs),
as they share the same markers including CD133, Sox2,
Nestin, PDGFRβ and others [4–6]. Importantly, GSCs can
survive traditional radio- or chemotherapy [7, 8], therefore
understanding these cells may contribute to solving the
core problem in glioma treatment [9].
Clinically, radiotherapy combined with the alkylating
agent temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard treatment that
indeed does improve overall survival of glioma patients [10];
however, chemotherapeutic drugs can induce DNA damage
and mainly kill fast proliferating tumor cells, not GSCs [11,
12]. Furthermore, due to the characteristic high stemness

INTRODUCTION
Malignant glioma accounts for 30% of all brain
tumors and 80% of malignant brain tumors. Although
tremendous effort has been devoted to the development
of treatment approaches, the prognosis of glioma is still
poor and has a very low 5-year survival rate [1]. Treatment
outcomes are particularly disappointing because of the
existence of a subgroup of glioma cells called glioma stem
cells (GSCs), which are characterized by self-renewal and
multiple differentiation potentials [2, 3]. GSCs are thought
to be generated by asymmetric division of neural stem

of these cells, GSCs can give rise to recurrent tumors even
after treatment [13]. These features may serve to explain the
poor outcomes of current therapies for glioma. Therefore,
targeting GSCs may increase sensitivity of glioma to radioand chemotherapy [14, 15]. Accumulating studies suggest
that manipulation of cellular pathways related to generation
and stemness of GSCs could be a promising way to inhibit
glioma genesis. For instance, inhibiting the Notch signaling
pathway by using a r-secretase inhibitor can induce the
differentiation of the GSCs into neuron- or astrocyte-like cells
and increase the sensitivity of the glioma to TMZ therapy
[16, 17]. Conversely, active Notch signaling can enhance
the radio- and chemoresistance of GSCs [18, 19]. Likewise,
inhibition of the Wnt signaling reduced proliferation and
sphere forming capacity of GSCs [20], whereas activation
of Wnt signaling is closely associated with radio- and
chemoresistance [21, 22]. Recent studies demonstrated that a
Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4),
can reduce GSCs by inducing cell apoptosis or repressing cell
proliferation [23]. Moreover, inhibition of the Wnt signaling
can chemo-sensitize the GSCs to TMZ [23, 24]. However, no
practical medication is currently available.
On the other hand, recent studies suggest that
antipsychotic drugs are potential candidates for glioma
treatment. It has been shown in epidemiological studies
that the incidence of cancer seems to be negatively
correlated with the antipsychotics treatment in patients
with schizophrenia as compared to normal individuals [25].
It is also known that the antipsychotic drug thioridazine
is able to selectively target neoplastic cells and impair
cancer stem cells, while having no effect on normal cells
[26]. Also, olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has
been shown to inhibit in vitro proliferation and migration
of glioblastoma cells and enhance the anti-tumor activity
of TMZ [27]. These studies suggest an antitumor feature of
antipsychotic drugs against in vivo glioma. To date, there
have been few studies regarding the underlying target and/
or pathway of antipsychotics on gliomagenesis, which
is crucial in the development of glioma treatment. Our
recent findings suggest that the differentiation of GSCs
may be a targeted process contributing to antipsychoticsrelated anti-glioma effect [28, 29]. We demonstrated
that (i) quetiapine (QUE), an atypical antipsychotic, can
induce the differentiation of the NSCs into OLs [28]; (ii)
QUE can prevent tumor metastasis by repressing breast
cancer induced osteoclast differentiation [29]. Since well
differentiated glioma, such as oligodendrogliomas, are more
susceptible to chemotherapy than other undifferentiated
gliomas [30, 31], we proposed QUE as an anti-gliomagenic
treatment by promoting the differentiation of GSCs into
OL-like cells and sensitizing them for TMZ treatment.
To test this hypothesis, we first examined the
effect of QUE on GSCs in cultured cells purified from
glioblastoma cell line GL261. Secondly, we established
xenograft gliomas in vivo to examine the treatment
effect of QUE, as well as its combined application with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TMZ. Thirdly, we applied a treatment paradigm of QUE
following TMZ withdrawal to test the specific effect of
QUE on GSCs. For the first time, we demonstrated that
QUE can promote the differentiation of GSCs into OLlike cells through inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway.
As a FDA approved drug, QUE may become a promising
candidate for glioma therapy.

RESULTS
QUE promotes differentiation of GSCs into
oligodendrocyte-like cells
To evaluate the effect of QUE on GSCs, we first
isolated cells from the glioblastoma cell line GL261 to
form spheres in a serum-free conditional medium with
EGF and bFGF (Supplementary Figure 1A). Most of the
cells demonstrated positive staining for stem markers
CD133 (98.56% ± 1.53%), Sox2 (97.25% ± 2.25%) and
Nestin (98.37% ± 1.02%) in proliferation media. After
being cultured in differentiation media (containing 10%
fetal bovine serum without growth factors) for 7 days,
the majority of the cultured cells expressed GFAP (glial
fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte marker) (88.77% ±
3.42%) whereas few cells expressed MBP (myelin basic
protein, an oligodendrocyte marker) (8.34% ± 1.03%)
(Supplementary Figure 1B-1D). Moreover, these cells
were able to form subcutaneous or orthotopic xenograft
tumors with pathological characteristics of gliomas after
being implanted into mice for four weeks (Supplementary
Figure 1E-1F), indicating successful purification of GSCs
in culture.
To test the effect of QUE on proliferation, we
treated GSCs cultured in proliferation media with QUE in
different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100μM) for
designated time periods. The CCK assay results showed
a trend of down-regulation of viable cell numbers in
correspondence with increasing concentrations of QUE,
and this decrease was statistically significant in high dose
treatments (50 μM and above) of QUE (Figure 1A). The
decrease in viable cells was likely due to a cytotoxic effect.
Analysis of the cell cycle indicated that when compared to
the control, the ratio of QUE-treated GSCs in S phase was
significantly reduced, whereas the ratio of cells in G2-M
phase was increased (Figure 1B); this shift indicates that
relatively high doses of QUE (>25 μM) may inhibit cell
proliferation by retarding cell cycle in the G2-M phase.
Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed using
25μM QUE.
We then further evaluated the effect of QUE
on GSC differentiation. GSCs were cultured in
differentiation medium with or without QUE treatment.
Our immunofluorescence staining revealed that after
QUE treatment, the number of MBP positive cells
was significantly increased, whereas the number
of GFAP positive cells was reduced (Figure 1C).

QUE inhibits Wnt/β-catenin pathway during
GSC differentiation

This immunofluorescence result was further confirmed
by Western blot assessment; QUE down-regulated
the expression of GSC marker Sox2, yet up-regulated
OL lineage marker MBP and Olig1 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1D–1E). Together, our data indicate
that QUE can both promote differentiation of GSCs
towards OL-like cells and suppress GSC proliferation
in vitro.

To mechanistically investigate the QUE-mediated
effect on GSCs, we evaluated the outcome of Wnt
signaling, as it has been shown to play an important role
in proliferation and differentiation of GSCs [32]. Using
the same paradigm of GSC culture and QUE treatment

described above, we assessed the activation of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in GSCs during differentiation with
or without QUE treatment. Western blot results showed
that: (i) after QUE treatment the phosphorylation levels of
GSK3β were decreased, whereas phosphorylation levels
of β-catenin (P-β-catenin) were increased in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2A–2B); (ii)
after co-administration of QUE with QS11 (an agonist

of Wnt-signaling pathway), QUE-induced reduction
of P-GSK3β (Ser9) and increase of P-β-catenin was
attenuated by QS11 (Figure 2C–2D). Moreover, QS11
application reversed QUE-induced effects, causing upregulation of Sox2, Olig2 and GFAP expressions, as
well as down-regulation of MBP (Figure 2E–2F). These
results indicate that the QUE-induced promotion of GSC

subcutaneous injection site 7 days after injection, and the
average diameter of the tumor reached 1.44 ± 0.43 cm at
day 21. In contrast, no tumors were found in the treatment
groups until day 10 post-GSC implantation (Figure 3B)
and the average diameter (0.70 ± 0.03 cm) of the tumors
was also smaller than that of the vehicle-treated controls
(p<0.05) (Figure 3C). Of note, tumor formation was
largely suppressed in the combined QUE+TMZ group,
indicated by both gross measurement and bioluminescence
imaging of the tumors (p<0.05) (Figure 3D–3F). Cellularly,
histopathological staining showed that treatment of QUE
or TMZ reduced the number of positively stained cells
for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Figure
4A), indicating their anti-proliferative effect on tumors.

QUE conducted anti-tumor effect that can be
enhanced in combination with TMZ
To determine whether QUE can inhibit the growth of
GSC-initiated tumors in vivo, we established a heterotopic
xenograft tumor model in nude mice and an orthotopic
xenograft model of glioma in C57 mice. First, mice with
subcutaneously GSC-induced tumors were treated with a
monotherapy of QUE or TMZ, or combined QUE+TMZ
vs vehicle controls for 21 days (Figure 3A). In the vehicletreated control group, mice formed small tumors at the

Additionally, Sox2, Olig2 and GFAP were down-regulated
while MBP was up-regulated in the QUE treatment group,
but not in the TMZ group (Figure 4A). Western blot results
further confirmed that QUE significantly up-regulated
MBP expression, but down-regulated vimentin (a marker
for glioma) and GFAP expression (Figure 4B). These data
suggest that QUE but not TMZ may promote differentiation
of GSCs towards OL-like lineage in vivo.
To further determine the therapeutic effect of QUE
on glioma in a clinically relevant model, we transplanted

GSCs intracranially into the striatum to establish an
orthotopic xenograft glioma mouse model. On the day
of cell implantation, mice began to receive treatments
of QUE, TMZ, or QUE+TMZ (see Methods). In line
with the findings of the above study using subcutaneous
xenograft tumor models, we observed that glioma growth
was dramatically suppressed by either monotherapy of
QUE or TMZ, or the combined QUE+TMZ treatment
(Figure 5A), as evidenced by bioluminescence data of
day 14 and day 21 after GSCs transplantation. Among

the three treatments, the combined QUE+TMZ treatment
had the highest antitumor efficacy (Figure 5A) and
the highest survival rate (75% survival at 60 days after
glioma establishment). Nonetheless, the survival rate of
mice with glioma was increased in all three treatment
groups vs vehicle controls (Figure 5B). In addition, we
have conducted further experimentation, using annexin
V/PI staining, to compare apoptosis of GSCs among the
treatments of QUE, TMZ, or QUE+TMZ. The annexin
V/PI staining showed that compared to the vehicle
control, the combined treatment of QUE and TMZ led
to significant cell apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 2)
whereas treatment with either QUE or TMZ alone was
devoid of this pro-apoptosis effect on GSCs. These data

indicate that (i) QUE has anti-tumor activity and this
activity can be enhanced by combination with TMZ; (ii)
apoptosis maybe one of the mechanisms involved in this
effect.

QUE suppresses the growth of TMZ-resistant
gliomas initiated by GSCs
To further determine if QUE specifically targets
the GSCs in gliomas, we established two GSC-related
tumor models in mice (subcutaneous xenograft tumor
and orthotopic xenograft glioma) combined with an
intervention paradigm of TMZ pretreatment followed by
QUE treatment. TMZ mainly kills fast proliferating tumor

cells, not GSCs; this ensures that QUE’s effects, if seen,
are caused mainly by effecting GSCs [33] (see Methods
and Figure 6A). In both models, tumors were observed
7 days after TMZ withdrawal. However, compared to
vehicle-controls, QUE treatment significantly suppressed
tumor growth, as determined by size and weight of the

tumors (Figure 6C–6D). Bioluminescence data also
revealed a similar effect of QUE in both subcutaneous
xenograft tumor and orthotopic xenograft glioma models
7 and 14 days after TMZ withdrawal, i.e., at Day 28
and Day 35 in Figure 6B and 6E. Importantly, QUE
treatment dramatically increased the survival rate of

effects with TMZ on gliomas as compared to either
individual monotherapy; and importantly (iv) QUE can
specifically inhibit GSCs in gliomagenesis.
Previous epidemic studies revealed that patients
with schizophrenia were less likely to be troubled
by glioma [34]. Despite this knowledge and its
common usage as a prescribed drug for patients with
schizophrenia, QUE has never been evaluated for its
effects on glioma; our evaluation of QUE-mediated
effects on GSC-initiated glioblastoma was intended
to help explain the phenomenon observed. GSCs are
the major source for gliomagenesis, and may originate
from the transformation of stem or progenitor cells,
including NSCs or OPCs. In addition, GSCs may also
result from de-differentiation of mature neurons, OLs, or
astrocytes [35]. Those cells are responsible for chemoresistance and the initiation of recurrent tumors, and are

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic
effects of the antipsychotic quetiapine (QUE) on
gliomagenesis and further explored its underlying
mechanisms. Using mouse models of GSC-initiated
subcutaneous xenograft tumors and orthotopic xenograft
gliomas, we demonstrated that: (i) QUE effectively
repressed GSCs-initiated tumor growth; (ii) the antiglioma effect of QUE was due to the combination of its
inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway along
with its promotive action on differentiating GSCs into OLlike cells; (iii) QUE demonstrated synergistic antitumor

thus considered an essential target in glioma treatment
[33]. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time
that QUE can inhibit GSC proliferation - this effect
was suggested to be related with the promotive effect of
QUE on differentiation of GSCs into OL-like cells. This
is consistent with our previous findings which showed
QUE to be unique among the anti-psychiatric drugs
based on its promotive effect on cell differentiation:
QUE can alleviate pathological demyelination by
promoting differentiation of NSCs into myelin-forming
OLs [28, 36]. The notion that differentiation of tumor
cells is crucial in response to chemotherapy was also
supported by other studies [30], Persson et al showed that
compared with other glioblastomas, oligodendrogliomas
were generated from relatively further differentiated
progenitors, and are much more susceptible to
conventional chemo-therapies [30]. In agreement with
these findings, here we demonstrate that QUE can
effectively repress in vivo GSCs-initiated tumor growth
due to the induction of most of the GSCs to differentiate
into OL-like cells.
As DNA methylation and DNA repair are two
targeted aspects of antitumor effect for the alkylating
chemotherapeutic agent TMZ, the expression of DNA
repair enzyme MGMT and removal of methyl residue in
GSCs were suggested as underlying the chemo-resistance
against TMZ of glioblastomas [33]. We demonstrated
that QUE can exert synergistic antitumor effect with
TMZ by promoting the differentiation of GSCs into
chemotherapy susceptible OL-like cells, thus improving
the therapeutic efficiency of TMZ. By treating the cells
with QUE after TMZ withdrawal, we demonstrated
that QUE can specifically target GSCs and effectively
inhibit either TMZ- resistant or –escaped tumors
generated from GSCs. Importantly, compared with
TMZ’s severe cytotoxicity to normal cells, QUE was
devoid of cytotoxicity and expressed relatively moderate
side effects, such as weight gain and sedation [37].
Since QUE has synergistic antitumor effects with TMZ,
combined application may also help reduce treatment
dose of TMZ and its related toxic effect. Moreover, the
reduced cost of QUE compared to TMZ [38, 39] can be a
considerable benefit factor to the patient in chemotherapy
of glioma.
Mechanistically, we demonstrated the underlying
mechanism for QUE-induced effect on GSC
differentiation, i.e. mediation of the inhibition of Wnt
signaling pathway. QUE up-regulated phosphorylation
of β-catenin and down-regulated p- GSK3β (Ser9),
which is closely linked to the regulation of the stemness
and differentiation of GSCs [40]. Aberrant activation
of the Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to lead
to gliomagenesis and tumor growth through nuclear

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

localization of β-catenin [41]. Activation of Wnt signaling
also negatively regulates OL lineage development,
including specification of OPCs from NSCs and terminal
differentiation of OLs [42]. In addition, our previous
work showed that selective activation of the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway by QS11 can suppress OL
differentiation [43]. In line with the aforementioned
findings, we showed here that QUE’s effect on GSCs
can also be attenuated by QS11, a selective agonist of
the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; this indicates that
QUE-induced bioprocesses in GSCs are likely mediated
via the Wnt signaling pathway and suggests a potential
application of QUE to induce OL-oriented differentiation
for enhanced effectiveness in chemotherapy of glioma.
Differentiation of GSCs is controlled by
complicated cell signaling pathways that are activated by
different extracellular and intracellular factors, and more
intensive studies are required to dissect QUE-induced
antitumor effects. For instance, through which up- and/
or downstream components does QUE impact the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway during GSC differentiation?
Previous studies have revealed that QUE is an antagonist
of multiple neurotransmitters, which affects activities of
dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, serotonin 5-HT 1A and
2A receptors, and histamine H1 receptor [44]. Notably,
inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor can upregulate the
phosphorylation of GSK-3β and suppress activation of the
Wnt signaling pathway via dishevelled-3 (Dvl-3) [45].
This raises the possibility that the effect of QUE on Wnt
signaling may be mediated through dopamine D2 activity,
though further investigation is required.
Altogether, we demonstrated that QUE can
promote the differentiation of GSCs into OL-like cells
via inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway, which led to
the sensitization of glioma for TMZ treatment. Therefore,
QUE, as an FDA approved drug, emerges as a promising
therapeutic candidate for the treatment of malignant
glioma.

Glioma stem cell culture
The glioblastoma cell line GL261 was obtained
from ATCC (CRL-1887) and maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco,
USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco,
USA), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco, USA) for 12 to 18 h. To purify GSCs, the culture
medium was first replaced by DMEM/F12 medium
with 5% FBS. After 24 and 48 h, the medium was
changed to DMEM/F12 medium with 2% or 1% FBS,
correspondingly. Lastly, culture medium was replaced

The procedure above was repeated every 24 h until several
primary tumor spheres (namely GSCs) were formed and

tumorospheres (diameter over 200μm) were dissociated
by accutase (Sigma, USA) and attached to Poly-D-lysinecoated coverslips and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium
containing 10% FBS for up to 7 days.

QUE (20mg/kg, i.p.) while the other group was injected
with vehicle for 14 days.

Cell counting assessment
To detect the effect of QUE on GSC proliferation,
the number of viable cells was measured using a CCK
assay (Dojindo, Japan) according to previously published
method [28] with the following modifications. First,
cultured tumorospheres were dissociated and single cell
suspensions (100μl) were seeded in each of 96-well
microplates at a density of 2×105cells/ml. After 12 h
incubation, these cells were treated with QUE (dissolved
in medium) in gradient concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20,
50 or 100 μM for up to 48 h. Then, 10 μl of Cell Counting
Kit (CCK) solution was added to each well followed by 4
h incubation. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a
microplate reader (Bio-RAD, Model 680) with a reference
wavelength of 650 nm.

Xenografts tumor models and drug treatment
All animal experiments were performed according
to an approved protocol from the Laboratory Animal
Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Third Military
Medical University. In the present study, two GSC-based
tumor models were employed. The prepared GSCs (104
cells, in a volume of 10 ul) were either (i) subcutaneously
injected into the inguen of nude mice to establish a
heterotopic xenograft tumor model, or (ii) orthotopically
transplanted into the striatum of C57 mice (coordinate
to Bregma: ML 2.00mm, DV 2.20mm, AP 0.14mm) to
establish a xenograft glioma mouse model [19]. According
to previous study [29], we used 1.5% pentobarbital sodium
to anesthetize the mice, and QUE was given to mice 3 h
after cell transplantation; at the time the mice were awake
and anesthetic drugs were predominantly metabolized and
should have minimal (or no) cross-effect on QUE.
To assess the treatment effect of QUE and TMZ,
mice were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 10
per group) and treated with: (i) vehicle (VEH, 0.9% NaCl,
i.p.) as a control; (ii) QUE (20mg/kg, i.p.)-monotherapy;
(iii) TMZ (20mg/kg, i.p.)-monotherapy; or (iv) combined
therapy of QUE and TMZ (QUE+TMZ, 20mg/kg of each,
i.p.). TMZ and QUE were both dissolved in 0.9% NaCl.
For the monotherapies, mice were subjected to daily i.p.
injection for 21 days. For the combined treatment of
QUE+TMZ, mice were subjected to daily i.p. injection of
QUE for 21 days, then, in addition, at day 8, mice started
receiving injections of TMZ every other day and until the
day of last QUE treatment (Figure 3A). Tumor growth was
measured using an external caliper every other day and
tumor volume was calculated as length×width2/2(mm2)
[46]. Animals were sacrificed at day 21 after the last
drug administration; tumor masses were dissected and
harvested for later histological evaluation. To access the
specific effect of QUE on GSCs, both the heterotopic
xenograft tumor model and the xenograft glioma mouse
models were pre-treated with TMZ (20mg/kg, i.p.) for 21
days and then randomly divided into two groups (n = 10
per group). One group was subjected to daily injection of

Cell cycle assessment
To examine the effect of QUE on cell division,
the cell cycle of the GSCs were analyzed using Flow
Cytometry assessment. Briefly, GSCs were incubated in
proliferation media with or without 50μM QUE for 48 h.
Then the cells were harvested and rinsed with PBS twice
and fixed in methanol for 15 mins in a -20°C freezer. After
incubation with RNase at 37°C for 30 min, cell nuclei
were stained with propidium iodide (PI, 50 μg/ml) for 30
min and examined in a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer
(Becton Dickinson). The cells in different cell cycles
(DNA histograms) were analyzed using modified software
(Becton Dickinson).

Bioluminescence imaging
Bioluminescence imaging was used for the detection
of tumor growth [47] with modification. Briefly, mice
were first anesthetized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane
and received intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin
(YEASEN, China) at a dose of 10 ul/g bodyweight. Ten
minutes after injection, mice were subjected to image
acquisitions in the IVIS Spectrum (Perkin-Elmer) three
times at a 2-minute interval. Acquired images were postprocessed for quantification using Living Image Software
for IVIS Spectrum.

Immunofluorescence and immunochemistry
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for immunocytochemistry evaluation
according to our previous study [43]. After being
incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.3%

Triton X-100 for 10 min to block non-specific reactions,
cells were incubated with primary antibodies (see Table 1)
overnight at 4°C followed by an incubation of secondary
antibodies (see Table 2) for 2-3 h at room temperature
(RT). Lastly, the cells on coverslips were counterstained
with DAPI (as a nuclear marker).
For histological evaluation, tumor tissues were sliced
(5μm thickness) and either stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H.E. staining), or used for immunohistochemistry
staining [29]. Briefly, the slides were first blocked with
PBS containing 0.8% hydrogen peroxide or PBS with
0.3% Tween-20 and 5% BSA, respective to stain protocol,
to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific
reaction, then incubated with the primary antibodies (see
Table 1) for 12 h at 4°C, followed by an incubation with
second antibody (see Table 2) for 5 h at RT. Lastly, the
antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using DAB
(Boster, China) as the chromogen.

by Tukey’s multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad, USA) software. A p-value less than 0.05 was
considered a significant difference.

Image acquisition and quantification
For immunofluorescence staining, immunoreactivity was determined by a confocal laser-scanning
microscope (PV100, Olympus) with excitation
wavelengths appropriate for FITC (488 nm), Cy3 (552
nm) or Cy5 (625 nm). Immunochemical staining results
were determined by microscope (BX60, Olympus),
with at least three samples selected from each group for
observation. For each section at least 9 fields were chosen
under the scope. Immunofluorescence positive cells and
optical density were counted by Image-Plus Pro software
5.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).

Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted from cultured cells and
tumor tissues using RIPA lysis buffer with freshly
supplemented 1% PMSF solution (Biocolors, China).
Cell lysates, each containing 50 μg total protein, were
separated through 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred
to polyvinyldifluoride membranes. For immuno-blotting,
membranes were first blocked in PBST (with 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h at RT, then incubated with the primary
antibodies for 24 - 48 h at 4 °C, followed by a incubation
with secondary antibodies for 2 h at RT (see Table 1
and 2). Anti-β-actin was used as the loading control.
Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL plus
detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK), and developed using Image station 4000 (Kodak
Carestream). All Western blot results were analyzed by
semiquantitative analysis using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media
Cybermetics, Rockville, MD, USA).
