ABSTRACT
Epigenetic therapies have emerged as promising anticancer approaches, since
epigenetic modifications play a major role in tumor initiation and progression.
Hydralazine, an approved vasodilator and antihypertensive drug, has been recently
shown to act as a DNA methylation inhibitor. Even though hydralazine is already
tested in clinical cancer trials, its mechanism of antitumor action remains undefined.
Here, we show that hydralazine induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in
human p53-mutant leukemic T cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that hydralazine
triggered the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by inducing Bak activation and loss
of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Hydralazine treatment further resulted in
the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, whereas a superoxide dismutase mimetic
inhibited hydralazine-induced cell death. Interestingly, caspase-9-deficient Jurkat
cells or Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells were strongly resistant to hydralazine
treatment, thereby demonstrating the dependence of hydralazine-induced apoptosis
on the mitochondrial death pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hydralazine
treatment triggered DNA damage which might contribute to its antitumor effect.

Conventional demethylating agents include the nucleoside
analogues 5-azacytidine and decitabine. Several reports
have confirmed that treatment with these nucleosides
analogues causes the up-regulation of apoptosis- and
cell cycle-associated genes, and induces cell death in
tumor cells, thus demonstrating their antitumor effect
[5-8]. Decitabine and 5-azacytidine are being currently
used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome and have been
recently approved for the treatment of acute myeloid
leukemia in Europe. In addition, phase I clinical trials
with decitabine, either alone or in combination with other
drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, have been
conducted in patients with refractory malignancies and
solid tumors [9]. The main problems associated with
these nucleoside analogues are their poor stability and
high toxicity. Zebularine, a chemically stable cytidine

INTRODUCTION
Three main epigenetic alterations, DNA
methylation, histone modifications and non-coding
RNAs, affect gene expression and play a central role in
many types of diseases, including cancer development and
progression. In particular, silencing of tumor suppressor
genes by promoter hypermethylation has been described in
a variety of human solid tumors such as lung, colorectal,
breast, gastric, endometrial and bladder tumors, as well as
in hematopoietic malignancies [1-3], contributing to clonal
expansion of malignant cells.
Interestingly, epigenetic modifications can be
reversed by pharmacological agents, such as DNA
methylation inhibitors, which suggest the valuable
therapeutic potential of these type of drugs in cancer [4].

analogue, exhibits demethylating activity together with
low toxicity in both in vivo and in vitro studies [10, 11].
During the last years, a group of non-nucleoside analogue
compounds with different structures has emerged as new
demethylating agents that prevent the toxic effects derived
from the incorporation into DNA. The antiarrhythmic drug
procainamide, the antihypertensive drug hydralazine and
the green tea polyphenol (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate,
among others, belong to this group [5, 12].
Hydralazine is a potent vasodilator that has been
widely used to treat hypertension during pregnancy as
well as heart failure [13, 14]. Recently, it has been shown
to act as a DNA methylation inhibitor by reducing the
expression of the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1
and DNMT3a, which, together with DNMT3b, are the
enzymes responsible for cytosine methylation in mammals
[15, 16]. In addition, binding models have been developed
that support a high affinity interaction between hydralazine
and DNMT1 [15, 17]. In comparative studies, hydralazine
as well as other non-nucleoside DNTM inhibitors have
shown lower ability to inhibit DNA methylation and
reactivate methylation-silenced genes in tumor cells than
conventional nucleoside inhibitors [18]. Nonetheless,
hydralazine is currently under evaluation in clinical trials
for cancer therapy, mainly in combination with a histone
deacetylase inhibitor [19-21], even though there is limited
understanding of its precise mechanism of action.
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type
of cancer with a high frequency of mutations in genes
encoding for epigenetic regulators, which suggests a
therapeutic potential of epigenetic drugs for the treatment
of this hematologic malignancy [22]. We have recently
described the induction of apoptosis by the nucleosides
analogues decitabine and zebularine in leukemic T cells
[23]. In the present study, we have evaluated the ability
of hydralazine to induce cell death in this hematologic
malignancy. Our results indicate that this DNTM inhibitor
triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in p53-mutant
leukemic T cells. Similarly to decitabine and zebularine,
we have found that hydralazine activates the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway and induces DNA damage.

panel). Significant apoptosis was observed in Jurkat and
MOLT-4 cells at concentrations of 200 μM and above
as soon as 24 hr after treatment with hydralazine, while
CEM-6 cells appeared slightly less sensitive (Figure 1A,
1C and data not shown). Interestingly, peripheral blood
lymphocytes from healthy donors were highly resistant
to hydralazine, even when incubated for three days with
the higher dose of 600 μM (Figure 1A, upper panel). We
verified the ability of hydralazine and procainamide to
inhibit DNMTs by analyzing the expression of DNMT1.
As shown in Figure 1B, high doses of hydralazine induced
a slight decrease in DNMT1 protein expression at 24 hr
and nearly a complete loss after 48 hr of treatment,
whereas procainamide had almost no effect on DNMT1
expression.
Next, we studied the involvement of caspases
in cell death induced by hydralazine. The pan-caspase
inhibitor Q-VD-OPh completely inhibited hydralazinemediated apoptosis (Figure 1C). Moreover, proteolytic
processing of the initiator caspases-8 and -9, as well as
cleavage of the effector caspase-3, was observed upon
treatment with 200 and 600 μM hydralazine (Figure 1D).
To further confirm the role of caspases in the induction
of apoptosis by hydralazine, we studied the response of
a caspase-9-deficient Jurkat clone to this demethylating
agent [23, 26]. As shown in Figure 1E, caspase-9deficient Jurkat cells (Jurkat w/o C9) were completely
resistant to hydralazine-induced apoptosis, in contrast
to deficient cells stably transfected with a caspase-9
expression vector (Jurkat C9).

The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by
hydralazine in leukemic T cells
Considering that caspase-9 is the initiator caspase
responsible for the mitochondrial apoptosis, we analyzed
several other features of this pathway in order to define the
mechanism of hydralazine-induced apoptosis in leukemia
T cell lines. Treatment of Jurkat cells with hydralazine
resulted in generation of ROS and disruption of ΔΨm.
Both events could be detected after 16 hr of incubation.
In fact, the FACS profiles suggested that mitochondrial
membrane depolarization preceded ROS accumulation, as
all cells producing ROS showed low ΔΨm, whereas not
all cells with depolarized mitochondria showed increased
ROS production (Figure 2A).
The proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are essential
for the initiation of mitochondrial dysfunction during
apoptosis and their effects are antagonized by other
members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2
itself. Since Jurkat cells are Bax-deficient, we analyzed
Bak activation in response to hydralazine by using an
active conformation-specific anti-Bak antibody. As shown
in Figure 2B, a significant activation of Bak could be
observed after 24 hr treatment. In addition, we studied the
effect of hydralazine in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2

RESULTS
Hydralazine induces caspase-dependent
apoptosis in leukemic T cells
To evaluate whether hydralazine induces apoptosis in
leukemic T cells, three different cell lines, Jurkat, MOLT-4
and CEM-6, were incubated with hydralazine in a range
of doses previously reported to reduce DNTM expression
and activity [24, 25]. As shown in Figure 1A, hydralazine
induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in all
leukemic T cell lines studied. In contrast, procainamide,
another non-nucleoside analogue DNMT inhibitor, did not
induce apoptosis in leukemic T cells (Figure 1A, lower

or Bcl-xL [23, 26]. We observed that overexpression of
these antiapoptotic proteins prevented hydralazine-induced
cell death as compared with mock-transfected Jurkat
cells (Figure 2C), thus confirming the involvement of
mitochondria in this process. As expected, overexpression
of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL also inhibited loss of ΔΨm and ROS
accumulation in response to hydralazine (Figure 2D).
To further delineate the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway triggered by hydralazine, we analyzed the
activation of mitochondrial events in caspase-9-deficient
Jurkat cells. Bak activation was similar in both caspase9-lacking and reconstituted Jurkat cells (Figure 3A).
However, hydralazine failed to induce ROS production
and disruption of ΔΨm in cells deficient in caspase-9
(Figure 3B).

Accumulation of ROS results in oxidative damage to
cell structures and molecules that lead to cell dysfunction
and death [27]. To establish whether ROS generation was
involved in the induction of apoptosis by hydralazine,
we studied the effect of the cell-permeable superoxide
dismutase (SOD) mimetic manganese-porphyrin,
Mn(III)TMPyP. When Jurkat cells were pretreated with
the manganese-porphyrin, a significant inhibition of
hydralazine-mediated apoptosis was observed (Figure 4A).
We confirmed the ability of the SOD mimetic to inhibit
ROS production in response to hydralazine (Figure 4B).
Strikingly, inhibition of ROS accumulation partially
prevented the dissipation of ΔΨm (Figure 4B), even
though mitochondria depolarization seemed to precede
ROS production.

were clearly detected in cells treated with hydralazine
(Figure 5B). Quantification of the tail moment in
time-course experiments demonstrated that cells with
significant DNA damage were already evident after 12 hr
of hydralazine treatment (Figure 5C).

Previous reports have described the induction of
DNA damage by nucleoside analogs DNMT inhibitors
[23, 28]. Hence, as an early marker of DNA double-strand
breaks, we analyzed the phosphorylation of the histone
H2AX (γ-H2AX) in response to hydralazine. As shown in
Figure 5A, high levels of γ-H2Ax were detected after 20
hr of treatment. We also determined the phosphorylation
of Chk-1, a substrate of the DNA damage response kinases
ATM and ATR. The phosphorylated and hence active form
of Chk-1 was observed at all time points analyzed after
treatment with hydralazine (Figure 5A). For comparison,
we analyzed Chk1 phosphorylation in response to
procainamide and observed that this drug did not induce
DNA damage (Figure 5A, lower panel). We confirmed
by comet assay the ability of hydralazine to induce DNA
damage. Comet tails indicative of DNA strand breaks

DISCUSSION
The smooth muscle relaxant drug hydralazine has
been recently included within the group of non-nucleoside
analogue DNMT inhibitors. Different studies have
described the high-affinity interaction between hydralazine
and DNMT that may lead to the inhibition of the enzyme
activity [15, 17]. In addition, it has been reported that
hydralazine acts by reducing the expression of DNMT1
and DNMT3a rather than directly inhibiting DNTM
enzymatic activity [16]. Whatever the precise mechanism
of hydralazine-induced demethylation is, it has been

shown to reactivate the expression of tumor suppressor
genes silenced by methylation as well as to induce cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in some tumor cells [24, 25, 29].
In Jurkat leukemic T-cells, previous studies have
reported that hydralazine decreases DNMT expression and
activity and inhibits DNA methylation [16, 30]. Now, we
show, for the first time, that hydralazine induces apoptosis
in Jurkat and other leukemia T cell lines. Since aberrant
methylation of several genes has been associated with the
pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
the response to treatment of patients [31-33], our results
support the possible use of hydralazine as a therapeutic
strategy against this hematologic malignancy. We
demonstrate that hydralazine induces caspase-dependent

apoptosis in leukemic T cells at doses that show no
significant toxicity for normal lymphocytes. Specifically,
we show the activation of caspases-3 and -8 in response
to hydralazine as well as the inhibition of apoptosis by the
general caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh. In agreement with
our data, previous studies suggested a cytotoxic activity
of hydralazine in cervical, breast and prostate cancer
cells [25, 34-36]. Nonetheless, our results are the first to
describe the signaling pathway of hydralazine-induced
apoptosis.
We have recently reported that the nucleoside
analogues decitabine and zebularine induce mitochondriamediated apoptosis in leukemic T cells [23]. Similarly,
we have now observed that hydralazine induces Bak

activation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
followed by ROS production, which are all events
associated with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Moreover, Jurkat cells deficient for caspase-9, the
upstream caspase of the intrinsic pathway, are resistant
to hydralazine-induced apoptosis. Likewise, hydralazine
does not trigger apoptosis in Jurkat cells overexpressing
either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Actually, all mitochondrial events
are prevented in cells overexpressing these antiapoptotic
proteins. All these data confirm the role of mitochondria
in the induction of apoptosis by hydralazine in leukemic
T cells. In the absence of caspase-9, there was neither a
loss of ΔΨm nor an accumulation of ROS in response
to hydralazine. However, upstream Bak activation was
similar in caspase-9-proficient and -deficient Jurkat
cells. These findings indicate that hydralazine triggers
the activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,
such as Bak, thus leading to the permeabilization of the
mitochondrial outer membrane and the following release
of intermembrane space proteins that allow the activation
of the initiator caspase-9. Subsequent activation of effector
caspases must give rise to the disruption of mitochondrial
function [26, 37]. The mitochondrial damage seems
to be essential for the complete dismantling of the cell,
as suggested by the inhibition of hydralazine-induced
apoptosis when preventing ROS accumulation with a SOD
mimetic. Similar results were reported for decitabine and
zebularine [23].
Our data suggest that hydralazine may activate an
apoptotic pathway similarly to that triggered by nucleoside
analogues, which is also comparable to that induced by
genotoxic stress [26]. Moreover, similarly to genotoxic
and nucleoside analogs drugs, hydralazine induces DNA
damage in leukemic T cells, as determined by comet
assay and activation of a DNA damage response. In
line, induction of DNA damage by hydralazine has been
recently reported in prostate cancer cells [36] and different
authors have described the generation of radicals derived
from the oxidation of hydralazine that may directly induce
DNA damage [38, 39]. Regardless of the mechanism of
DNA damage induction by hydralazine in leukemic T
cells, this event must play an important role in apoptosis,
as it is clearly evident after 12 hr treatment, concurrent
with the activation of the apoptotic signaling pathway.
Comparing the effects of hydralazine with that of
nucleoside analogs in leukemic T cells, minor differences
are found [23]. First, the kinetic of DNA damage and
apoptosis induction seems to be faster in response to
hydralazine. In addition, inhibition of ROS accumulation
partially prevents the dissipation of ΔΨm in response to
hydralazine, even though mitochondria depolarization
seems to precede ROS production, thus suggesting a
positive feedback loop between both mitochondrial events
that was not observed for nucleoside DNMT inhibitors.
Interestingly, the leukemic T cell lines used in our studies
lack functional p53. Other authors have reported the upwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulation of p53 in HeLa cells in response to hydralazine,
although they did not demonstrate a direct relationship
between p53 up-regulation and the antitumor effect of
this drug [40]. Therefore, hydralazine may be considered
as a novel therapeutic strategy that, similar to decitabine
and zebularine and more efficiently than them, induces
apoptosis by a p53-independent mechanism, at least in
leukemic T cells.
Regarding the significance of the demethylating
effect of hydralazine in the induction of apoptosis, a
reduction of DNMT1 protein level and activity has been
observed in ovarian cancer cells in response to treatment
for one day with hydralazine in a range of doses from
150 to 600 μM [24]. However, the studies of Cornacchia
et al. described the inhibition of DNA methylation in
Jurkat cells upon treatment for more than five days with
lower doses of hydralazine than those required to induce
apoptosis in our study [30]. Here, we have shown that
activation of apoptosis signaling and induction of DNA
damage preceded depletion of DNMT1 in response to
high doses of hydralazine. The fast kinetics of apoptosis
induction by hydralazine in leukemic T cells suggests
that, at least in part, it may be independent of DNA
demethylation. On the other hand, the ability of the
antiarrhythmic procainamide to inhibit DNA methylation
has been reported to be similar to that of hydralazine
[29]. However, unlike hydralazine, we observed that
procainamide does not induce apoptosis in any of the
leukemic T cell lines used in the present study, even when
used for three days (data not shown) at concentrations up
to 500 μM, a dose that induces only a slight decrease of
DNMT1 expression after 48 hr of treatment. Interestingly,
procainamide did not activate a DNA damage response in
leukemic T cells.
In agreement with previous reports describing
the low toxicity of hydralazine in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and human umbilical vein endothelial
cells [25, 41], we show that higher doses of hydralazine
have a minimal effect on the viability of normal
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Preclinical studies with
hydralazine, mostly in combination with the histone
deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid, have supported
its safety, good tolerability as well as its anticancer
efficacy. A treatment combination with hydralazine has
not only shown promising results in myelodysplastic
syndrome [20], but also seems to increase the efficacy
of chemotherapy in breast and cervical cancer [19,
21], and improve the response to imatinib in patients
with chronic myeloid leukemia refractory to this drug
[42]. Hydralazine has proven to induce the expression
of tumor suppressor genes without producing global
DNA demethylation in patients with cervical cancer
[43]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that treatment
with hydralazine and valproic acid enhances the
effects of immunotherapy in cancer by regulating the
expression of certain molecules, such as HLA class-I,

Determination of mitochondrial membrane
potential and ROS production
Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were analyzed
by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells (2.5 × 105) were incubated
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and
containing the oxidant-sensitive probe DHE (2 μM) and
the fluorescent potentiometric dye DIOC6 (3) (10 nM)
for 20 min at 37°C in the dark. Quantitative analysis was
carried out in a FACSCanto cytometer with the Cell Quest
software.

Cells and cell culture
The human leukemic T cell lines Jurkat, MOLT-4
and CEM-6 were kindly provided by Dr. Abelardo LópezRivas (CABIMER, Sevilla, Spain). Jurkat cells deficient in
caspase-9 and caspase-9 reconstituted Jurkat cells have been
previously reported [26]. Jurkat cells stably overexpressing
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL were generously provided by Dr. Jacint Boix
(Departamento de Ciencias Médicas Básicas, Universidad
de Lleida, Spain). Blood samples were obtained from
healthy donors by informed consent and collected into
citrates tubes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were
then isolated by Ficoll–Histopaque density gradient
centrifugation (Sigma–Aldrich) and depletion of adherent
monocytes by culture on plastic dishes for 1 hr at 37°C.
All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 μM l-glutamine, penicillin
and streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95%
