Drug Combination Studies and Their Synergy Quantiﬁcation
Using the Chou–Talalay Method—Letter
John C. Ashton

Advances in the theory of combination therapy (1) and
development of new targeted drugs are leading to a new
emphasis on drug combination experiments. Many studies
continue to use the median-effect method of Chou–Talalay
(2). However, the median-effect method follows a similar logic
to the defunct Scatchard analysis in pharmacology, which has
been replaced by nonlinear modeling. Like Scatchard analysis,
the median-effect method assumes idealized mass-action principles and relies on log-linearization. With widespread access to
powerful desktop computers, nonlinear regression has replaced
Scatchard analysis in pharmacology. This is because log-linearization skews the distribution of residuals in the experimental
error and can lead to poor model ﬁts compared with nonlinear
regression. A similar problem occurs in median-effect analysis.
Even more importantly, most response curves do not closely ﬁt
to idealized mass-action models. Poor model ﬁts in drug

combination analysis distort the estimates of the response to
the individual drugs used in an experiment and, thus, distort
the interpretation of drug combination. For instance, in our
own work, we have found that complex changes in the slope of
the response curve at moderately high concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor inhibitors in combination
experiments with crizotinib can reverse conclusions based on
shorter dose ranges—such that a synergistic combination (3)
erroneously appears to be inhibitory.
Both Scatchard and median-effect analysis date from a time
before nonlinear regression was widely accessible. There is now no
reason why the median-effect method should not go the same way
as Scatchard analysis, and nonlinear regression be used to ﬁt
response models, rather than poorly ﬁtting idealizations. The
advantages of this approach are several: First, nonlinear regression
allows greater ﬂexibility in ﬁtting more appropriate curves to data,
which, second, yield more realistic response curves and, third,
improved validity of conclusions. Finally, nonlinear regression
can also solve an outstanding problem in median-effect analysis,
the robust treatment of experimental error (4), a crucial element
in any research project in this era of concern over the reproducibility of preclinical research (5).
