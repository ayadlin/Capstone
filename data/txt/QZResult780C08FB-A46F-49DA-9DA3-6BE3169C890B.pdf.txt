ABSTRACT
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a critical pathway in the
biology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Proviral integration site for moloney
murine leukemia virus (PIM) serine/threonine kinase signaling takes part in various
pathways exerting tumorigenic properties. We hypothesized that the combination of
a PIM kinase inhibitor with an mTOR inhibitor might have complementary growthinhibitory effects against AML. The simultaneous inhibition of the PIM kinase by panPIM inhibitor AZD1208 and of mTOR by selective mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor AZD2014
exerted anticancer properties in AML cell lines and in cells derived from primary AML
samples with or without supportive stromal cell co-culture, leading to suppressed
proliferation and increased apoptosis. The combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014
rapidly activated AMPKα, a negative regulator of translation machinery through
mTORC1/2 signaling in AML cells; profoundly inhibited AKT and 4EBP1 activation;
and suppressed polysome formation. Inhibition of both mTOR and PIM counteracted
induction of heat-shock family proteins, uncovering the master negative regulation
of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the dominant transcription factor controlling cellular
stress responses. The novel combination of the dual mTOR inhibitor and pan-PIM
inhibitor synergistically inhibited AML growth by effectively reducing protein synthesis
through heat shock factor pathway suppression.

people of all ages [1]. Activation mutation of upstream
regulators such as Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and
KIT is a frequent event in AML pathogenesis, regulating
various downstream pathways such as Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR, and Jak/STAT and
resulting in leukemogenesis [2]. However, targeted
therapy in AML has achieved only partial success, and the
mechanisms contributing to resistance are yet to be fully
discovered.
Activated FLT3 signaling induces expression of
the STAT5 gene, which subsequently induces expression
of proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia
virus 1 (PIM1) in AML [3]. FLT3 is the most frequently
mutated gene in AML cells, and approximately 30% of
AML patients harbor constitutively activating internal
tandem duplication (ITD) mutations known to be
associated with poor prognosis [2, 4-6].
PI3K/AKT/mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved
pathway that plays an important role in regulating
cell growth and proliferation. Mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) has been an attractive target for
treatment of various types of tumors for years, but the
efficacy and clinical activity of the first-generation mTOR
inhibitors, which selectively target mTORC1, have been
disappointing [4, 5]. Inability to inhibit mTORC2 is one of
the potential key factors in rapamycin resistance, in which
S6K1 and TSC1/2 are involved in a negative-feedback
loop to regulate mTORC2 levels, resulting in cell survival
and metabolic regulation [6].
AZD2014 is a second-generation dual mTORC1/2
inhibitor that has entered preclinical and clinical trials,
showing highly specific activity against mTORC1/2
and thereby efficiently blocking the AKT/mTOR signal
transduction pathway [5]. AZD2014 effectively inhibited
mTORC1 targets phospho-(p-)S6K (Thr-389), p-4EBP1
(Thr-37/46), and mTORC2 target pAkt (Ser473), causing
effective inhibition of the mTOR pathway without
negative-feedback induction of mTORC2 in different
types of tumor cells [7].
PIM proteins are considered “weak” oncoproteins
because they require an accompanying oncoprotein to
exert their tumorigenic properties. They are overexpressed
in a broad range of tumors, including both hematological
malignancies [8] and solid tumors [9]. The PIM protein
family consists of 3 members (PIM1, 2, and 3) with tissuespecific expression distribution and overlapping functions;
PIM1 and PIM2 are enriched in the hematopoietic system
[10]. There have been several reports on the association
of PIM1 with chemotherapy or radiotherapy resistance in
various tumor types [11-15]. Though the PIM kinases are
attractive pharmaceutical targets, targeting one member
leads to development of resistance via the compensatory
functions of the other members of the family because
of the high degree of homology among them [16]. The
highly specific pan-PIM inhibitor AZD1208 abolishes
the compensatory effect from the other PIM family
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

members and has been shown to have antitumor efficacy
in both AML cell lines and primary samples [17]. PIM
kinase signaling takes part in various pathways to define
cell fate, including senescence, cell cycle regulation,
apoptosis, metabolism, invasion, and metastasis; thus the
combination of a PIM kinase inhibitor with an mTOR
inhibitor is expected to offer greater antitumor effects in
AML than either inhibitor alone [18]. Furthermore, PIM
and AKT kinase inhibitors show synergistic cytotoxicity
in AML associated with mTOR and MCL1 pathway
repression [19].
Therefore, we hypothesized that these inhibitors
used in combination might have complementary growthinhibitory effects against AML, although no preclinical
investigation of a regimen combining mTOR and PIM
inhibitors against AML subtypes has been published.
In this study, we used in vitro screening to identify the
efficacy of a novel drug combination, pan-PIM inhibitor
AZD1208 and dual-mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014,
and demonstrated that the combination of AZD2014
and AZD1208 synergistically inhibited growth of AML
regardless of FLT3 mutation status through impaired
polysome assembly and induction of apoptosis.

RESULTS
Expression of PIM1 kinase in AML cells
It has been reported that FLT3-ITD activation
mutation leads to upregulation of PIM1 [13]. To examine
whether FLT3 mutations are associated with high PIM1
expression levels in AML, we first determined the PIM1
mRNA expression levels in AML patient samples from
2 large studies (GSE14468 and GSE1159) using the
Oncomine Platform (Life Technologies, Ann Arbor,
MI). These analyses showed greater expression of PIM1
mRNA in the FLT3-mutant (FLT3-MT) samples than in
the FLT3 wild-type (FLT3-WT) AML samples in both
the GSE14468 series (P < 0.001; 168 FLT3-MT samples
versus 276 FLT3-WT samples) and the GSE1159 series
(P = 0.002; 106 FLT3-MT samples versus 178 FLT3-WT
samples) (Figure 1A). Immunoblot analysis to determine
the protein expression levels of PIM1 along with PIM2 and
PIM3 of AML cell lines with known FLT3-mutation status
(FLT3-WT; OCI-AML3, MOLM-16, FLT3-ITD; MV4;11,
MOLM-13, MOLM-14) revealed no association of PIM
expression and FLT3 mutation status (Figure 1B). The
PIM1 protein levels of 13 primary AML samples (9 with
FLT3-WT and 4 with FLT3-ITD) further demonstrated
no distinct relevance to FLT3-mutation status (Figure
S1). These results suggest that FLT3 mutations might be
associated with high levels of PIM1 mRNA but not protein
expression in AML.

13, which required progressively higher doses. To assess
the interaction between PIM and mTOR inhibitors, we
used Calcusyn software to analyze their effects on growth
inhibition according to the Chou-Talalay method [20, 21];
this analysis demonstrated a very strong synergistic effect
between AZD1208 and AZD2014 in MOLM-16, a strong
synergistic effect in MV4;11, synergism in MOLM-14 and
OCI-AML3, and a slight antagonistic effect in MOLM-13
cells (Table 1).
Next we tested the effect of AZD1208 and AZD2014
on primary AML samples with either FLT3-WT or FLT3ITD status (Table S1) under stromal co-culture conditions
that used bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) to mimic physiologic conditions [22-24]. As
shown in Figure 2B, AZD1208 induced moderate growth
inhibition of cells from 2 of 6 primary AML samples
(Patients #2 and #3) and AZD2014 had the same effect
in 4 of 6 samples (Patients #1-#3 and #6). In particular,
cells from Patient #2 were considerably more sensitive

To assess the effects of a combination of panPIM inhibitor AZD1208 and dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor
AZD2014, we investigated the proliferation and survival
of cultured AML cell lines treated with these agents. AML
cells were treated with AZD1208, AZD2014, or their
combination for 72 h, and the viable cells and Annexin
V-positive cells were isolated and counted. As shown
in Figure 2A, both AZD1208 and AZD2014 resulted
in dose-dependent growth inhibition and cell death in
AML cells (except MOLM-14, which were relatively
resistant to AZD1208). The sensitivity to PIM inhibitor
AZD1208 varied among AML cell lines: MOLM-16 was
extremely responsive to AZD1208, requiring the lowest
concentration to induce cell growth inhibition and cell
death, followed by OCI-AML3, MV4;11, and MOLM-

than cells from the other samples to both AZD2014 and
AZD1208. Combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014
further reduced cell viability and increased the percentage
of Annexin V-positive cells in all the AML samples except
those from Patients #4 and #5, which responded only to
AZD2014. The sensitivity to AZD1208 and AZD2014 in
AML patient-derived cells seemed unaffected by FLT3
mutation status. Similar trends were observed in the same
experiments carried out without MSC co-culture (Figure
S2). The responses of AML cell lines and primary AML
samples to the PIM inhibitor indicate that the sensitivity to
PIM inhibition is independent of FLT3-ITD status.
Importantly, the clonogenic assay revealed the
complementary effect of the 2 drugs in all the primary
sample-derived cells tested regardless of FLT3 mutation
status (Figure 2C and Table S2). Notably, additive effects
were seen in samples from Patients #8 and #9, in which
each inhibitor alone exhibited only moderate or no effect.

mTOR inhibitor AZD2014 alone or combined with PIM
kinase inhibitor AZD1208 caused disappearance of the
upper, slower mobility phosphorylated bands of 4EBP1;
moreover, some reduction of the lower unphosphorylated
band was seen in all cell lines tested. c-Myc, another
biomarker for the induction of leukemogenesis and
frequently activated in AML, is known to work in concert
with the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signal transduction pathway
[26]. In FLT3-ITD cell line MV4;11, both AZD1208 and
AZD2014 as single agents and in combination reduced
c-Myc protein levels while in FLT3-WT cell line MOLM16, only AZD1208 reduced c-Myc protein level (Figure
3A).
The association of AKT phosphorylation with
cell survival has been reported previously [27]. AKT is
upstream of mTORC1 and downstream of mTORC2 in
the mTOR signaling pathway [27]. Like the other mTOR
targets, AKT phosphorylation was reduced after treatment
with AZD1208, AZD2014, or the combination in MV4;11
and OCI-AML3 cells (Figure 3C and 3E). Furthermore,
phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha
(AMPKα, Thr172) was rapidly induced after only 3 h of
the combination treatment but not AZD1208 or AZD2014
alone (Figure 3D). AZD2014, AZD1208, and their
combination reduced CXCR4, a known mediator of AKT
activation [28], in OCI-AML3 but not MOLM-16 cells, in
which the AZD1208 and AZD2014 combination reduced
phosphorylation of ERK (Figure 3E).

Effects of AZD1208 and AZD2014 on downstream
signaling pathways
Having confirmed the synergistic effect of PIM
inhibitor AZD1208 and mTOR inhibitor AZD2014,
we next examined the molecular pathway of cell death
induced by these inhibitors using Western blotting and
flow cytometry. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
protein (4EBP1), one of the key molecules in mTOR
pathway-mediated CAP-dependent translation, is the
known downstream target of AZD1208 in AML [18, 25].
Phosphorylation of S6 at Ser240/244, another biomarker
for mTOR activity, is the downstream target of mTORC1
and mTORC2. As expected, mTOR inhibitor AZD2014
and the combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014 rapidly
reduced the phosphorylation level of 4EBP1 (Thr37/46)
and S6 (Ser240/244) in cell lines OCI-AML3, MOLM16, and MV4;11 (Figure 3A and 3E). Similar results
were obtained in cells derived from the primary AML
samples treated with AZD1208 and AZD2014 (Figure
3B). Treatment with the combination of AZD1208 and
AZD2014 reduced the phosphorylation level of both
4EBP1 and S6 to a greater extent than either drug alone
in MOLM-16. Reduction of phosphorylated p-4EBP1
detectable by phospho-specific antibody was also
apparent by probing with total 4-EBP1 antibody, whereby

Proteomic profiling of combined AZD1208 and
AZD2014 treatment in AML cells
To investigate the pathways altered by AZD1208
and AZD2014, either as monotherapy or in combination,
we employed a proteomic approach using isobaric tags
for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis,
which measures mature proteins as an approach to closely
examining possible biological changes in cells. As shown
in Table 2, the iTRAQ analysis revealed that AZD1208,
AZD2014, and their combination caused changes in
various proteins. We extracted lists of proteins commonly
altered by these drugs both in MOLM-16 and OCI-AML3
cells and found that AZD1208 reduced elongation factor
1-alpha 1 (EF1A1) while AZD2014 reduced elongation
factor 2 (EF2), revealing that the translation elongation

process is negatively regulated by these agents (Table 3).
Interestingly, the combination treatment inhibited these
targets to a greater extent than monotherapy; moreover,
the combination therapy reduced other protein synthesisrelated factors, including elongation factors such as
eukaryotic initiation factor 4a-1 (IF4a1) and ribosomal
protein S4, X-linked (RS4X), whereas it induced
proapoptotic gene CH10 (HSPE1). Metabolic pathwayrelated proteins such as fatty acid synthase also were
significantly downregulated by the combination (Table 3).
Using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources [29, 30]
and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics
tool [31], we performed pathway analysis to characterize
the drug-induced alterations in biological processes (Table
4). In AZD1208/AZD2014-sensitive MOLM-16 cells, the
pathway most altered by AZD1208 was the ribosome
biogenesis pathway, while the pathway most altered by
AZD2014 was the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway.
Combined, these inhibitors altered ribosome biogenesis,
as expected (Table 4). In OCI-AML3 cells, which were
moderately responsive to either AZD1208 or AZD2014,
only the combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014 altered
the ribosome pathway, suggesting that the combination
of AZD1208 and AZD2014 might enhance functional
alteration of protein synthesis (Table 4).
The IPA platform highlighted repression of the
transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a central
upstream regulator, by the combination of AZD1208 and
AZD2014 in both the MOLM-16 and OCI-AML3 cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lines (Figure S3). Previous reports suggest that HSF1
activity is reflected by a range of post-translational
modifications [32, 33], which might explain the lack
of detectable change in total HSF1 protein level in the
analysis. HSF1 is a master regulator of various cellular
functions, including proliferation, survival, ribosome
biogenesis, and glucose metabolism [34, 35], and thus
suppression of the HSF1 pathway indicates efficient
repression of ribosome biogenesis, leading to cell cycle
inhibition. In both cell lines, upstream regulator Myc was
downregulated by AZD1208 and Myb was downregulated
by AZD2014. The combination caused downregulation of
both Myc and Myb, emphasizing its synergistic effect on
two oncogenic transcription factors playing critical roles
in cellular proliferation and apoptosis.

Translational repression by AZD1208 and
AZD2104
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays
an important role in polysome formation, which controls
CAP-dependent translation for protein synthesis [36]. We
therefore performed polysome fractionation analysis in
MOLM-16 and OCI-AML3 cells treated with AZD1208,
AZD2014, or the combination to test whether the
polysome fraction was altered by either of the drugs. We
found that AZD1208 as well as AZD2014 altered the
polysomal profile, indicating a reduced level of CAP37936

cells, AZD2014 alone or in combination with AZD1208

We next focused on the changes induced by these
drugs in the polysome association of gene transcripts,
which indicates the mode of translation. We assessed

AML [37]. Figure 4B illustrates the levels of cyclin D1

DISCUSSION

and AZD1208 had various levels of synergy, stronger in
FLT3-WT cell lines than in FLT3-ITD mutant cells lines,
indicate that FLT3-ITD-overexpressing mutation might
affect pathways others than PIM and mTOR downstream
signaling and thus escape the inhibitory effect of the
combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014.
Consistently with previous reports [7, 25, 38],
AZD2014 inhibited the mTORC1 pathway, as was shown
by reduced phosphorylation of phospho-(p-)S6K (Ser-240244) and p-4EBP1 (Thr-37/46), as well as the mTORC2
pathway, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of
p-AKT (Ser473). PIM kinases phosphorylate TSC2
to activate mTORC1 and phosphorylate 4EBP1 with
activation of eIF4E, resulting in CAP-dependent
translation [39]. Although the combined treatment with
AZD1208 and AZD2014 caused a relative decrease of the
p-4EBP1/total 4EBP1 (the lower unphosphorylated band)
ratios, the amount of unphosphorylated 4EBP1 bands were
also decreased in all tested cell lines and in a primary
AML sample. This paradox can be explained by the
finding that reduced eIF4E activity by hypophosphorylated
4EBP1 leads to degradation of its repressor protein

In this study, we used in vitro screening of a
novel drug combination, pan-PIM inhibitor AZD1208
and dual-mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 in AML. Our
findings demonstrate that these inhibitors when used in
combination arrest protein synthesis through simultaneous
inhibition of the mTORC1/2 pathway and induce apoptosis
in AML cells.
While Oncomine data analysis indicated that
FLT3 mutations are associated with high levels of PIM1
expression in AML patients, our analysis demonstrated
that FLT3-ITD mutation status was not associated
with differential levels of PIM1, 2, and 3 protein
expression and did not confer higher sensitivity to PIM
inhibition. Importantly, a clonogenic assay revealed the
complementary effect of the 2 drugs in all the primary
AML cells tested regardless of FLT3-ITD mutation status,
suggesting the efficacy of prolonged treatment with
the combination at the level of AML progenitor cells.
Furthermore, considering the proto-oncogenic property of
PIM kinases, our results showing that combined AZD2014

4EBP1 through ubiquitination [40]. AMPK is a known
negative regulator of mTORC1 [41], and the pan-Pim
kinase inhibitor or PIM1 siRNA has been shown to block
mTORC1 activity by stimulating the phosphorylation
and thus activation of AMPK [42]. Concordant with
these reports, our results indicate the contribution of the
AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway to the greater antitumor
effects of the AZD1208 and AZD2014 combination than
either drug alone. Moreover, the AZD1208 and AZD2014
combination reduced CXCR4 surface expression or ERK
phosphorylation in a cell line-dependent manner. CXCR4
is a known mediator of AKT and ERK activation [28,
43] as well as a target of PIM [44], and several studies
demonstrated the downregulation of p-ERK by PIM1
knockdown or by treatment with a PIM1 inhibitor [45,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

46]. Taken together, our findings indicate the possible
antitumor effects of simultaneous inhibition of mTOR
and PIM through depletion of the mTORC1/2 feedback
reaction and repression of known and putative PIM1
kinase downstream targets.
Our protein expression analysis and profiling of
relevant pathways revealed suppression of Myc by the
mTOR inhibitor, of Myb by the PIM inhibitor, and of
HSF1 by either. Although the Myc oncogene is known to
directly regulate the protein synthesis machinery, recent
reports suggest that, in Myc-driven cancers such as AML,
Myc enhances protein synthesis by activating mTORdependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1 [47]. Both Myc
and Myb, another oncogenic transcription factor, might
play roles in the antitumor efficacy of the AZD1208 and
37940

AZD2014 combination [48]. Notably, HSF1 inhibition
was frequent in OCI-AML3 and MOLM-16 cells treated
with AZD1208, AZD2014, or the combination. In cancer
cells, translation is driven by HSF1 through regulation
of ribosome biogenesis [49, 50], and HSF1-dependent
transactivation is regulated by mTOR activity [51].
Global screening by iTRAQ analysis, which detected the
small but significant (P < 0.05) differences in expression
of multiple proteins in the same pathway [47], indicates
that the combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014 directs
cells to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through mTOR
inhibition. Fatty acid synthase, one of the proteins most

significantly downregulated by the combination regimen
(but not by either drug alone), is a possible downstream
target of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [52]. Inhibition
of fatty acid synthesis is known to inactivate AKT and
promote apoptosis in bladder transitional cell carcinoma
[53]. We have further demonstrated impaired polysome
formation in AML cells treated with the mTOR inhibitor
and PIM inhibitor and reduction of polysome formation of
the oncoprotein cyclinD1, possibly through suppression
of the HSF pathway. Finally, proapoptotic protein CH10

targets modulated by the combination, it is conceivable
that not a single target, but multiple downstream effectors,
contribute to the observed growth-inhibitory effects.
Recently, Meja et al. [55] demonstrated the synergistic
cytotoxicity of a combination of AKT and PIM inhibitors
in AML, with convergence on inhibition of Myc, MCL1, and BAD. It is well documented that mTOR signaling
contributes to multiple aspects of cancerous behavior,
including metastasis, survival, and chemotherapy
resistance [56, 57]. Importantly, AZD2014 is now at the
stage of a phase II clinical trial for solid tumors after the
safety and tolerability were documented in a phase I trial
[58].
In summary, our findings provide the first evidence
that the combination of dual mTOR inhibitor AZD2014
and pan-PIM inhibitor AZD1028 effectively reduces
protein synthesis by simultaneous inhibition of the
mTORC1/2 pathway and induces apoptosis in AML
cells. These findings suggest that this combination is
an attractive therapeutic strategy for AML and warrants
further clinical investigation.

fewer than 10 leukemic cells per visual field remained
attached. To verify lack of significant contamination
in collected leukemic cells, they were analyzed by
flow cytometry using CD45 as a discriminator between
leukemic cells and MSCs [62]. Data were acquired and
analyzed by using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). In indicated
experiments, co-cultures were performed in the presence
of the pan-PIM inhibitor AZD1208 and/or the dual mTOR
inhibitor AZD2014; both were provided by AstraZeneca
R&D (Waltham, MA).
Peripheral blood and BM samples were obtained
from patients with AML after informed consent was
obtained in accordance with a protocol approved by
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board regulations. Ficoll-Hypaque
density gradient centrifugation was used to separate
mononuclear cells (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability, apoptosis, and specific cell death were
assessed by the trypan blue exclusion cell count method
and by Annexin V/7AAD staining positivity analyzed
by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS Array
Bioanalyzer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described
previously [63].

Cell viability and apoptosis assays

Cells and culture conditions
The following FLT3-ITD mutant AML cell lines
were used: MV4;11 [59], purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); MOLM-13
[60], provided by Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories
(Okayama, Japan); and MOLM-14 [60], provided by
Dr. Mark Levis (Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Baltimore, MD). FLT3-WT AML cell lines
OCI-AML3 [61] and MOLM-16 were purchased from
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
at 37°C in 5% CO2.
To represent the BM stroma, MSCs obtained from
healthy BM donors and AML patients were cultured
at a density of 5,000 to 6,000 cells/cm2 in minimum
essential medium alpha supplemented with 20% FBS, 1%
L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin as described
elsewhere [62]. Passage 3 or 4 MSCs were used for the
co-culture experiments. To study the effect of BM stroma
on AML cells, MOLM-13 and HL60 cells were cultured
at a density of 5×105, with or without a layer of MSCs
plated at a density of 0.2×105 cells/cm2. Co-cultured AML
cells were separated from the MSC monolayer by careful
pipetting with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution
(PBS), repeated twice. After the AML cells were collected,
to rule out the possibility of contamination with MSCs,
MSC monolayers were examined by microscopy (×100)
to confirm that the monolayer was not damaged and that

Flow cytometry for detection of the expression
level of intracellular phospho-proteins
MOLM-16 and OCI-AML3 cells were treated
for 6 h with AZD1208 (2 µM), AZD2014 (1 µM),
or the combination. Cells were then fixed with 1.6%
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatfield, PA) and subjected to permeabilization in ice-cold
methanol (70% in PBS; 1 mL/million cells) for 20 min.
After washing twice, cells were resuspended in 1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS. Antibodies were added to the cell
suspension and incubated for 30 min. Antibodies used
were Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204)
(E10) mouse monoclonal antibody (Alexa Fluor 488
Conjugate #4374; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA); Phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser235/236)
(D57.2.2E) XP rabbit monoclonal antibody (Alexa Fluor
647 Conjugate #4851; Cell Signaling Technology);
Phospho-Akt (Ser473) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Alexa
Fluor 647 Conjugate #A88881; Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
Brea, CA); and CXCR4 (CD184-APC, #555976; BD
Biosciences). After washing twice, cells were resuspended
and analyzed by a Gallios flow cytometer (BeckmanCoulter).

Quantitative real-time PCR

The iTRAQ chemical labeling mass spectrometry
(MS) method was performed by following the
manufacturer’s protocol [64]. Briefly, cell lysates were
subjected to liquid chromatography (LC)-shotgun analyses
using the iTRAQ method as described previously [65].
Prior to iTRAQ analysis, lysates were concentrated and
buffer exchanged by using 3.5-kDa molecular weight
cut-off spin concentrators (Tomy Seiko Co., Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan), then digested for 24 h with 10 μg trypsin treated
with L-1-(4-tosylamido)-2-phenylethyl tosylphenylalanyl
chloromethyl ketone. Each peptide solution was labeled
with one of the 4 iTRAQ reagents (iTRAQ reporter ions
of 114, 115, 116, or 117 mass/charge ratios) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (AB SCIEX, Framingham,
MA). The tag labeling order was 114 for controls, 115 for
AZD1208-, 116 for AZD2014-, and 117 for AZD1208/
AZD2014 combination-treated cells. Labeled peptides
were pooled and fractionated by strong cation exchange,
using a ChromXP C18-CL column (Eksigent division of
AB SCIEX, Dublin, CA), and analyzed by nano LC-MS/
MS; nano LC-MS was performed on a TripleTOF 5600
mass spectrometer for MS/MS (AB SCIEX) interfaced
with a nanoLC system (AB SCIEX) [66]. Proteins
were identified and quantified relatively by applying
ProteinPilot Software Version 4.5 (AB SCIEX) to the data
as previously described [67]. Functional definitions of
the protein contents were searched against the Swissport
database (Release 10/16/2013) using the search algorithm
within ProteinPilot Software and Analyst TF Software
(AB SCIEX). Protein ratios were normalized by using
the overall median ratio for all the peptides in the sample
for each separate ratio in every individual experiment.
A confidence cutoff for protein identification of >95%
was applied. Proteins whose expression was statistically
significantly changed by treatment were subjected to
functional analysis by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources or the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems,
QIAGEN; www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).

RNA (50-100 ng) from polysomal fractions isolated
by using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) was
used to synthesize cDNA with the iScript Reverse
Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were
then performed on a 7900 System (Applied Biosystems,
Grand Island, NY) with a SYBR Green qPCR kit (Applied
Biosystems) and gene-specific primers for β-actin
(ACTB VHPS110; RealTimePrimers.com) and cyclin D1
(CCND1; Hs.PT.56a.4930170; IDT).

Clonogenic assay
Mononuclear cells were seeded at 0.05-0.1×106
cells/mL in Methocult H4435 (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada). AZD1208 (1 or 3 µM),
AZD2014 (0.25 or 0.5 µM), or the combination was added
to the medium before plating. The cells were subjected
to vortexing for 15 s and were then plated on 35×10mm dishes with a 2×2-mm grid (NUNC) in triplicate
and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37°C in 5%
CO2 for 14 days. Colonies were scored by using a 1×-3
stereoscope (VWR, Radnor, PA).

Western blot analysis
Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (i.e.,
PBS containing 1× cell lysis buffer [Cell Signaling
Technology], 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche,
Indianapolis, IN], and 1× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
I/II [Calbiochem, San Diego, CA]) and incubated
for 30 min on ice. The lysates were then subjected to
centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. Protein
concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total proteins (40 μg) were
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred
to polyvinylidene-fluoride membranes (0.45 μm, GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), then probed with first
and second antibodies according to the manufacturers’
protocols. For immunoblotting, the following antibodies
were used: alpha-tubulin and beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich),
PIM1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), PIM3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), PIM2, p70 S6 Kinase,
phospho-(p-) p70 S6 Kinase (Thr389), 4EBP1, phospho(p-)4EBP1 (Thr37/46), AKT, p-AKT (Ser473), AMPK-α,
pAMPK-α (Thr172), c-myc, GAPDH, and horseradish
peroxidase-linked anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (all from
Cell Signaling Technology).

Polysomal assay
Molm-16 and OCI-AML3 cells were treated for 6 h
with 2 or 3 µM AZD1208, respectively, 1 µM AZD2014,
or the combination. Cells were then washed twice with
PBS supplemented with cycloheximide (100 µg/mL;
Sigma) and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mM
Tris, pH 7.5; 2.5 mM MgCl2; 1.5 mM KCl) supplemented
with cycloheximide (100 µg/mL), dithiothreitol (2
mM, Sigma), protease inhibitor (Cocktail set V EDTA
free; Calbiochem), and RNase inhibitor (1 U/µL; Life
Technology). After the suspension was subjected to
vortexing for 4 s, Triton ×100 (0.5%; Sigma) and sodium
deoxycholate (0.5%; Sigma) were added to the mix. After
spinning at 12,000g for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant
was transferred to a new tube and snap-frozen in liquid

Statistical analysis
Synergism, additive effects, and antagonism were
assessed by the Chou-Talalay method [21], utilizing
Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Cells were
treated by serially diluted AZD1208 and / or AZD2014
with a ﬁxed constant ratio (4:1 for MOLM16, 10:1 for
MOLM14, MV4;11. MOLM13, OCI-AML3). After 72
hours treatment, viable cell numbers were determined by
the trypan blue exclusion cell count method. The effect on
cellular proliferation was shown as a percentage reduction
of cell viability when compared with dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-treated controls. The mean of three independent
experiments was obtained. The average combination
index (CI) value for the experimental combination was
calculated from the 50%, 75%, and 90% effective doses.
By this method, CI values indicate the following: 0.3-0.7,
strong synergism; 0.7-0.85, moderate synergism; 0.85-0.9,
slight synergism; 0.9-1.1, nearly additive; 1.1-1.2, slight
antagonism; 1.2-1.45, moderate antagonism; 1.45-3.3,
antagonism; 3.3-10, strong antagonism [21].
