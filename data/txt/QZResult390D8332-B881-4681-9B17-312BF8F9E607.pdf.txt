Abstract
The relationships between environmental factors and the
genetic abnormalities that drive carcinogenesis are supported
by experimental and epidemiologic evidence but their
molecular basis has not been fully elucidated. At the genomic
level, most human cancers display either chromosomal (CIN)
or microsatellite (MIN) instability. The molecular mechanisms
through which normal cells acquire these forms of instability
are largely unknown. The arylamine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP)
is a tobacco smoke constituent, an environmental contaminant, and a well-established carcinogen in humans. Among
others, bladder, lung, colon, and breast cancers have been
associated with 4-ABP. We have investigated the effects of
4-ABP and N-methyl-N ’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) on
genetically stable colorectal (HCT116) and bladder (RT112)
cancer cells. Cells were treated with carcinogens to generate
resistant clones that were then subjected to genetic analysis to
assess whether they displayed either CIN or MIN. We found
that 50% to 60% of cells treated with 4-ABP developed CIN but
none developed MIN as confirmed by their ability to gain
and lose chromosomes. In contrast, all MNNG-treated clones
(12/12) developed MIN but none developed CIN as shown by
the microsatellite assay. The mismatch repair protein
expression analysis suggests that the acquired mechanism of
MIN resistance in the HCT116 MNNG-treated cells is associated with the reduction or the complete loss of MLH1
expression. By providing a mechanistic link between exposure
to a tobacco constituent and the development of CIN, our
results contribute to a better understanding of the origins of
genetic instability, one of the remaining unsolved problems in
cancer research. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7088–94]

Introduction
Carcinogenesis has been interpreted for a long time as the effect of
point mutations. However, Cairns (1) pointed out long ago that it is
unlikely that mutagenesis alone explains carcinogenesis. He
suggested that the driving forces in the process are more likely to
be gross chromosomal abnormalities and the selection of cells that
carry them. Such interpretation has received support from recent
observational, experimental, and theoretical developments: (a) the

observation of an association between chromosome abnormalities
and cancer in prospective studies in humans (2); (b) the acknowledgment of the importance of genetic instability in hereditary and
sporadic cancers, including chromosome instability (CIN) and
microsatellite instability (MIN; refs. 3, 4); and a ‘‘Darwinian’’ interpretation of the carcinogenic process, in which a key role is played by
the selective advantage of cells carrying genetic abnormalities (5–7).
The present study had two aims: (a) to investigate the mechanisms
of acquired resistance to treatment with high doses of potent carcinogens, and (b) to investigate the types of genetic instability (CIN or
MIN) acquired by cells which became resistant to different carcinogens.
Epidemiologic studies indicate that a large fraction of human
cancers are associated with exposure to specific environmental carcinogens. For example, the occurrence of human bladder cancer is
largely explained by exposure to arylamines from different sources,
including tobacco-smoking and occupational exposures. The arylamine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) is a tobacco smoke constituent, an
environmental contaminant, and a well-established carcinogen in
humans. Among others, bladder, lung, colon, and breast cancers have
been associated with 4-ABP. Previous research from our group and
other groups has suggested that arylamines contained in tobacco
smoke—such as 4-ABP—form adducts with proteins and DNA, can
induce p53 mutations in the bladder, and eventually lead to bladder
cancer (8–11). 4-ABP is an environmental contaminant generated
mainly from cigarette smoke, the combustion of fossil fuels, as well
as in rubber and coal (12). Upon metabolic activation, the electrophilic derivatives of 4-ABP interact with DNA and form adducts that
have been found to correlate with bladder carcinogenesis in humans
and animals (13). Thus far, it was believed that the molecular bases
through which 4-ABP mediates its carcinogenic activity were connected to its ability to cause mutations in the human genome (14, 15).
There is evidence, however, that bladder cancer is mainly the result
of gross chromosome alterations rather than point mutations.
Chromosome aberrations and chromosome instability (CIN) have
been shown to play a central role in the onset of most solid tumors.
A smaller fraction of cancers are associated with mismatch repair
defects and consequently display MIN. We previously reported that
exposure to specific carcinogens can select for tumor cells with
distinct forms of genetic instability (CIN or MIN; refs. 16–18). We
therefore hypothesized the existence of a mechanistic link between
tobacco smoke constituents—such as 4-ABP—and the occurrence
of CIN in cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage
of genetically stable bladder (RT112) and colorectal (HCT116-CH3)
cell lines. These cells represent two useful models to assess the
relationship between carcinogens and genetic instability as they can
manifest CIN or MIN, but not both (3, 19). In addition, both cell
lines were completely stable in terms of maintenance of chromosome number and nucleotide sequence.

4-ABP Induces CIN in Human Cancer Cells

Materials and Methods
Study design. The study was designed according to a two-step strategy.
First, genetically stable human cancer cells were treated with specific
carcinogens [4-ABP or N-methyl-N ’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)] to
generate resistant clones. Second, we assessed whether carcinogen-resistant
cells displayed either CIN or MIN, after a second treatment with the same
carcinogens.
Cell culture. HCT116 chromosome 3 corrected cells were cultured in
McCoy’s 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine
serum (Sigma), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (10,000 units penicillin
G and 10 mg streptomycin/mL; Sigma). RT112 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (vol/vol), 1% penicillin-streptomycin
solution (10,000 units penicillin G and 10 mg streptomycin/mL).
Carcinogen treatment. For treatment with 4-ABP (Sigma), cells were
detached, counted, and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640. 4-ABP was
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) and activated in NADPH generating system
solution (0.27 mmol/L NADP, 5 mmol/L glucose 6-phosphate, 0.45 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.45 mmol/L KCl, and 200 mmol/L Tris-HCl; Sigma) containing
0.4 mg/mL Aroclor 1254-induced S9 rat liver extract (BD Italy) for 2 h at
37jC. Cells were treated 4 h at 37jC and then washed and resuspended in
complete medium. 4-ABP–resistant cells were established by treatment with
125 Ag/mL of 4-ABP for RT112 cells and 175 Ag/mL of 4-ABP for HCT116
cells. After treatment, single-cell clones were obtained by a limiting dilution.
For treatment with MNNG (Sigma), cells were detached, counted, and
resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640. Cells were treated for 4 h at 37jC,
and then washed and resuspended in complete medium. MNNG-resistant
cells were established by treatment with 0.75 Ag/mL of MNNG for RT112
cells and 1.0 Ag/mL of MNNG for HCT116 cells. Twenty-four hours after
treatment, cells were detached and resuspended in fresh medium. After

another 24 h, single-cell clones were obtained by a limiting dilution. The
relative resistance of isolated clones was evaluated by the treatment of
5  105 cells with appropriate concentrations of carcinogens. After exposure
to the carcinogen, cells were detached, stained with 2% (vol/vol) trypan blue
(Sigma) and re-counted. Two subsequent treatments were necessary to
increase clone resistance.
MIN assay. All clones, as well as the parental cell lines, were screened for
sequence alterations in the mononucleotide repeat BAT-26, located within
intron 5 of the MSH2 gene (20). Assessment of the status of BAT-26 has
been previously used to establish MIN status (21). PCR reactions were done
in 12.5 AL reactions containing 2.5 AL of genomic DNA (extract with QIAmp
column; Qiagen), 1.25 AL of buffer, 1.25 AL of MgCl2, 200 Amol/L of
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 0.5 Amol/L of each primer.
The primers used for amplification were 5¶-TTT GAC TAC TTT TGA CTT
CAG CC-3¶ and 5¶-AAC CAT TCA ACA TTT TTA ACC C-3¶. Forward primers
were fluorescence-labeled at the 5¶-end. Initial denaturation was done at
95jC for 12 min, followed by 10 cycles of 15 s at 95jC, 15 s at 54jC, and 30 s
at 72jC and other 30 cycles of 15 s at 89jC, 15 s at 54jC, and 30 s at 72jC
with a final extension step at 72jC for 30 min. Diluted PCR products (1 AL)
were mixed with 12 AL of formamide and 0.5 AL of internal standard size
maker (TAMRA 500). The mix was denatured at 95jC for 5 min and cooled
on ice. Samples were loaded on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems). The data were collected automatically and analyzed using the
Genescan 3.1 software (ABI). MIN was scored if microsatellite lengths in
clones and matched normal cells were different.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Carnoy-fixed cells were centrifuged
and fresh fixative was added to obtain the desired cell concentrations for
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Single-slide multichromosome FISH analysis was done using the Chromoprobe Multiprobe
system following the manufacturer’s protocol (Cytocell). The Chromoprobe

A homoscedastic two-tailed t test was used to investigate the statistical
significance of the differences between the cell line and the clone protein
expression, as quantified by the immunoblotting method. The variance used
in the t test has been estimated from repeated measures of the same signals,
to take into account the variability derived from the Bio-Rad algorithm
quantifying protein expression. All calculations were done in R version 2.4.1.

Development of isogenic cellular models displaying resistance to human carcinogens. To assess whether genetic
instability could be associated with exposure to carcinogens, we
took advantage of two cell models. The cell line HCT116 was
originally derived from a MIN colorectal cancer carrying a point
mutation in the mismatch repair gene hMLH1 (22). MIN in these
cells was corrected by adding an extra chromosome 3 containing
the hMLH1 wild-type gene (23). RT112 is a DNA repair–proficient
cell line derived from a human epithelial bladder carcinoma (24)
that we found to be chromosomally stable.
The first step of this work was to establish derivatives of the two
cell lines displaying resistance to the two carcinogens (4-ABP and
MNNG). To achieve this, we treated the cells with a panel of
carcinogen concentrations in order to obtain cytotoxicity curves
for every combination of cell line carcinogen (Fig. 1).
Then, 4-ABP-resistant and MNNG-resistant cells were established by treatment with the concentration of carcinogens that
normally kills >99% of cells of the two cell lines (HCT116 and
RT112). After treatment, viable single-cell clones were obtained by
limiting dilution.

Mulitprobe-I system allows the simultaneous enumeration of up to 24
chromosomes. The device was divided into 24 square areas each containing
a satellite III probe (chromosomes 1, 9, and Y) or an a-satellite one (all the
other chromosomes). Some probes recognized more than one chromosome,
and for this reason, it is not possible to discriminate between chromosomes
1, 5, and 19, chromosomes 13 and 21, and chromosomes 14 and 22.
Moreover, centromere signals for chromosomes 16, 17, 20, and Y were
particularly weak. We decided to limit our CIN assay to chromosomes from
numbers 2 to 12, excluding chromosome number 5 and confirming results
using chromosome-specific painting probes (Cytocell).
For FISH analysis, cell suspensions were dropped on clean and dry slides
and slides were immersed in 2 SSC (pH 7.0) for 2 min and than
dehydrated in an ethanol series (70–85–100%), for 2 min each. Ten
microliters of probe were placed on cell sample slides, covered with glass
coverslips and end-sealed with rubber cement. Slides were denaturated
onto a hotplate at 75jC for 2 min and then placed overnight in a humid,
light-proof chamber at 37jC. The day after, coverslips were removed and
slides washed in 0.4 SSC at 72jC for 2 min, and then in 2 SSC and 0.05%
Tween 20 at room temperature for 30 s. Ten microliters of 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole antifade were then applied on dry slides and covered with
coverslips. Results were observed with the DM2000 fluorescence microscope (Leika) and images were collected using the FW400I software (Leika).
Immunoblotting. Cell lysates were prepared in EB buffer. Immunoblotting was done on Hybond membrane (Amersham). Anti-MLH1 and antiMSH2 antibodies (PharMingen) were used according to the instructions of
the manufacturer. Signals were developed by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer). Relative quantification of protein expression was
done using Quantity One v.4.6 Basic software (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analyses. The statistical significance of the differences between
the resistance of clones (second treatment) and parental cell lines was tested
using a two-sided P value from a Fisher test applied to a cell-counting data
(Table 1). The same test was used to evaluate the differences in MIN between
resistant clones and parental cell lines. CIN was assumed if at least 40% of
the investigated markers (chromosomes) revealed loss of signal.

capable of assessing CIN by measurement of random chromosome
losses and gains. To establish the assay, we first did a preliminary
karyotype analysis that confirmed trisomy of chromosome 3 and
monosomy of chromosome 21 in the HCT116 cells. We also found
that RT112 cell line displayed monosomy of chromosome 17, a
typical aberration in bladder cancers (25).
Next, CIN was assessed using a FISH strategy, allowing the
concomitant analysis of all 24 chromosomes (see Materials and
Methods for details on the CIN assay). The results of the assay,
confirmed by using chromosome-specific painting probes, indicate
that 4-ABP–resistant clones (obtained from both cell lines) display
a striking and reproducible CIN phenotype consisting of the ability
of losing and gaining chromosomes (Table 2). On the contrary, the
parental cell lines and those resistant to MNNG were chromosomally stable. These results indicate that cells exposed to 4-ABP
acquire CIN.
The FISH analysis also suggested specific differences between
the clones treated with 4-ABP. For example, HCT116 clones
resistant to 4-ABP showed selective loss of chromosomes 11 and 20
(Fig. 2A and B; Table 2), whereas RT112 clones showed selective
loss of chromosomes 4 and 6 when compared with the
corresponding parental counterparts (Fig. 2C and D; Table 2).
Cells exposed to the carcinogen MNNG display MIN. It has
been described that MIN can be assessed by analyzing tumor DNA
with specific markers such as the BAT-26 microsatellite located in
intron 5 of the MSH2 gene (see ref. 26 for more details). To
determine whether the carcinogen-resistant clones showed MIN,
we extracted their genomic DNA and amplified target sequences
with FAM-labeled BAT-26 primers. Although the BAT-26 sequence
was stable in the parental cell lines and in all 4-ABP–resistant
clones, all MNNG-resistant clones (derived from both HCT116 and
RT112) displayed a striking degree of MIN (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3).
Because MIN has previously been linked to mismatch repair
defects, we have used Western blotting to analyze the level and
pattern of expression of MLH1 and MSH2 in clones resistant to the
carcinogens. The results suggest that the acquired mechanism of
MIN resistance in the MNNG-treated colorectal cells is associated

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

with the reduction or the complete loss of MLH1 expression. In
particular, clone HCT-MNNG-5 has a protein expression level that
is not statistically different from the parental cell line (P = 0.758),
whereas clones HCT-MNNG-8 and HCT-MNNG-10 show a reduction of the expression levels (P = 0.002 and P = 0.045, respectively).
In clone HCT-MNNG-12, the signal is absent (P < 0.001).
Interestingly, the mechanism seems to be cell line–specific and
carcinogen-specific, whereas the same does not occur in RT112
cells line and in 4-ABP–resistant clones (data not shown). The
results are shown in Fig. 4.
Carcinogen-specific induction of CIN and MIN. Most, if not
all, human cancers display either CIN or MIN. Interestingly, the two
forms of instability seem to be mutually exclusive. For example,
f85% of colorectal cancers are CIN with the remaining 15%
displaying MIN. This suggests that one of the forms of genetic
instability is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis and that CIN and
MIN cancers may be epidemiologically associated with exposure to
specific environmental carcinogens. We took advantage of the cells
treated with the different carcinogens to assess whether the
‘‘genetic instability phenotype’’ was carcinogen-specific. To this
end, we verified whether cells that had become CIN upon exposure
to 4-ABP may also display MIN and vice versa. We found that the
two forms of genetic instability were present in a mutually
exclusive pattern in our isogenic cell models. Specifically, cells
exposed to 4-ABP developed CIN but not MIN, as shown by
analyzing their BAT-26 sequence (Figs. 2 and 3; Table 2). On the
contrary, cells exposed to MNNG developed MIN but not CIN as
measured using the chromosomal gain and loss FISH assay
previously described (Figs. 2 and 3; Table 2).

Discussion
CIN and MIN have been described as two alternative pathways to
cancer. Both are mainly referred to as intrinsic properties of the
cells that display them, as traits that persist throughout the lifetime
of the cells, and as a property that the cells can transmit to their
progeny. CIN is generally defined as the ability of a cell to gain and
lose chromosomes and is a feature of many (both sporadic and
hereditary) types of cancer (3, 27). Conversely, MIN is mainly

exposure. RT112 and HCT116 chromosome 3–corrected cells expressed
full-length forms of both proteins. RT-MNNG clones show the same pattern of
expression whereas HCT-MNNG clones show a comparable expression of
MSH2 protein only. MLH1 signals are, respectively, conserved in clone 5,
decreased in clones 8 and 10, and completely absent in clone 12.

4-ABP Induces CIN in Human Cancer Cells

associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and
sporadic gastrointestinal cancers carrying a defect in the DNA
mismatch repair machinery (MIN cancers). The assessment of MIN
status aids in establishing a clinical prognosis and may be
predictive of tumor response to chemotherapy.
The present study aimed at investigating the ability of different
carcinogens to cause CIN or MIN, respectively, in cultured cell lines.
The arylamine 4-ABP is a tobacco smoke constituent, an
environmental contaminant, and is a well-established carcinogen
in humans. Bladder, lung, colon, and breast cancers have been
associated with 4-ABP (28–31). The molecular basis through which
4-ABP mediates its carcinogenic activity are poorly understood and
are thought to be connected to its ability to cause mutations in the
human genome. We hypothesized that in addition, or independently from its activity as a direct DNA mutagen, 4-ABP could
affect tumor occurrence by inducing genetic instability. Our
hypothesis was based on the evidence that bulky adduct-forming
agents, such as 4-ABP, can induce chromosome breaks through
nucleotide excision-repair processes (32), leading to the suggestion
that cells with defects in DNA repair or mitotic checkpoints might
be selected after exposure to such agents (15, 33).
Our results show that upon exposure to 4-ABP, human cells
become genetically unstable. Specifically, they display CIN as
confirmed by their ability to gain and lose chromosomes at a high
frequency. CIN represents the predominant form of genetic instability in human solid tumors (including bladder and colon), whereas
MIN occurs in only 10% to 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers and
is rare in other tumors (30). Interestingly, the net result of CIN is
the deregulation of chromosome number (aneuploidy) and an
enhanced rate of loss of heterozygosity, which is an important
mechanism of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Cytogenetic
studies of bladder, lung, and colon tumors have shown that karyotype
complexity, cell ploidy, and the number of structural changes found
were closely associated with tumor grade and stage (34–39).
Previous studies on bladder cancer have detected complex
patterns of losses and gains of chromosomes (40–44). Interestingly,
the selective losses of chromosomes 4 and 6 that we observed in
the carcinogen-resistant cell lines indeed corresponded with some
of the most common losses typically observed in bladder cancers.
Importantly, in the parental RT112 line, these alterations were not
present. In the colorectal cancer cell line, we detected possible
selective losses of chromosomes 11 and 20. Previous studies on
colorectal cancers (45–49) showed complex cytogenetic profiles in
which the gain of chromosomes 20, 7, and 13, and the loss of
chromosomes 4 and 18, were commonly observed. Interestingly,
the selective losses of chromosomes 11 and 20 have also been
previously detected.
Altogether, our results indicate that the chromosomal alterations
associated with the acquisition of resistance to carcinogens might
be tumor-specific and cell-specific. Further studies are clearly
needed to confirm a possible mechanistic role for the specific

chromosomal alterations we detected and the development of
carcinogen resistance and genomic instability. The mismatch
repair protein expression analysis suggests that the acquired
mechanism of MIN resistance in the HCT116 MNNG-treated cells is
associated with the reduction or the complete loss of MLH1
expression. The mechanism seems to be carcinogen-specific as the
same does not occur in 4-ABP–resistant clones.
The dose of carcinogen was high enough to kill >99% of the cells of
the two cell lines used. These exposure circumstances are obviously
far from most human experiences of exposure to carcinogens.
Cumulative exposure to tobacco carcinogens can easily approach or
even overtake a total dose that would kill 99% of cells in the tissue, but
chronic cumulative exposure is not comparable to acute exposure.
Cells chronically exposed to the same cumulative dose have time
to repair and do not undergo massive death. Further investigations
are planned with chronic exposures of cells to lower doses. However,
a more direct comparison with the human exposure situation is
possible if we consider acute exposures that might massively affect
certain tissues, such as the exposure of bladder cells to occupational
carcinogens in the past (including aromatic amines), or the exposure
of liver cells to aflatoxin. In fact, a few experimental studies have
considered the effects of acute, high-dose exposures in animals, and
concluded that this could be a plausible mechanism of carcinogenesis in addition to the more conventional one based on long-term
exposure to lower doses (50). In these cases, our model of acquired
genomic instability followed by clone selection may be more directly
relevant.
We therefore propose that CIN in tumors such as those affecting
the bladder and the colon might be the result of exposure to the
tobacco smoke constituent and environmental pollutant 4-ABP or
chemicals with a similar mechanism of action. Furthermore, we
suggest that different environmental carcinogens can induce
specific forms of genetic instability (14, 15). These data offer
potential clues to one of the remaining unsolved problems in
cancer research, the relationship between environmental factors
and the genetic abnormalities that drive tumorigenesis. By
providing a mechanistic link between exposure to a tobacco
constituent and the development of CIN, our results contribute to a
better understanding of the origins of genomic instability, a key but
thus far, rather mysterious concept in carcinogenesis.
