Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTC) released into blood from primary cancers and metastases reﬂect the current
status of tumor genotypes, which are prone to changes. Here, we conducted the ﬁrst comprehensive genomic
proﬁling of CTCs using array–comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and next-generation sequencing. We
used the U.S. Food and Drug Administration–cleared CellSearch system, which detected CTCs in 21 of
37 patients (range, 1–202/7.5 mL sample) with stage IV colorectal carcinoma. In total, we were able to isolate
37 intact CTCs from six patients and identiﬁed in those multiple colorectal cancer–associated copy number
changes, many of which were also present in the respective primary tumor. We then used massive parallel
sequencing of a panel of 68 colorectal cancer–associated genes to compare the mutation spectrum in the
primary tumors, metastases, and the corresponding CTCs from two of these patients. Mutations in known
driver genes [e.g., adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), KRAS, or PIK3CA] found in the primary tumor and
metastasis were also detected in corresponding CTCs. However, we also observed mutations exclusively in
CTCs. To address whether these mutations were derived from a small subclone in the primary tumor or
represented new variants of metastatic cells, we conducted additional deep sequencing of the primary tumor
and metastasis and applied a customized statistical algorithm for analysis. We found that most mutations
initially found only in CTCs were also present at subclonal level in the primary tumors and metastases from the
same patient. This study paves the way to use CTCs as a liquid biopsy in patients with cancer, providing more
effective options to monitor tumor genomes that are prone to change during progression, treatment, and
relapse. Cancer Res; 73(10); 2965–75. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are rare cells found in the
blood of patients with solid tumors. The isolation and characterization of CTCs has tremendous potential for new biologic insight with very real clinical applications, such as the

identiﬁcation of prognostic, predictive, and pharmacokinetic
biomarkers (1, 2). For example, in colorectal cancer, the KRAS
mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) represent a paradigm
that has been established as a negative predictive marker for
treatment with EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (3). Thus, "realtime" longitudinal monitoring of CTC-derived genotypes may
provide a noninvasive approach to identify drug sensitivity and
resistance-associated markers, guiding therapeutic decisions.
However, because CTCs constitute as few as 1 cell per 1  109
normal blood cells in patients with metastatic cancer, it is
difﬁcult to identify and isolate these cells with current detection methods (4). Multiple approaches to CTC isolation and
characterization have been published (5, 6). However, the main
application of the most currently available CTC detection
systems consists of an enumeration of putative CTCs without
further analyses.
A powerful example of the application of CTC genotyping
was provided by a study of patients with non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). A subset of NSCLC has somatic activating
mutations in EGFR, and these patients are likely to beneﬁt from
treatment with selective EGFR kinase inhibitors. Through
monitoring of CTCs, the acquisition of the recurrent

T790M-EGFR drug resistance mutation has become evident in
CTCs during the course of therapy and has coincided with the
development of clinically refractory disease (7).
In fact, single-cell analyses have evolved to an active area,
with various attempts to assess the genome of individual cells.
For example, single-nucleus sequencing was shown to be
capable of characterizing tumor evolution in breast cancer
(8). However, this method was not suitable for assessing the
genetic characteristics of single tumor cells at a single-nucleotide resolution because sequencing was conducted at merely
approximately 0.2 times coverage. Therefore, only copy number variations in single tumor cells were analyzed (8). In other
studies, individual cells from hematopoietic (9) and kidney (10)
tumors were analyzed by exome ampliﬁcation and subsequent
sequencing. Obtaining a 30 times coverage, the data could be
used to establish lineage relationships between the cells, based
on the point mutations (9, 10). These studies also showed
that ampliﬁcation and sequencing errors are a concern for
single-cell mutation analysis, as the false discovery ratio was
2–3  105 and the average allele dropout ratio for all single
cells was approximately 11% (9, 10). To limit these problems,
the authors deﬁned a true mutation only if it occurred in a
speciﬁed number of cancer cells. For example, somatic-mutant
loci had to be present in at least 5 myeloproliferative tumor
cells and be homozygous normal in the respective nonmalignant tissue used for comparison (9). More recently, a single-cell
whole-genome analysis to measure the genomic diversity in
one individual's gamete genome was described to create
personal recombination maps from whole-genome sperm data
(11). Using a special microﬂuidic device on haploid cells, the
authors reduced the false discovery rate to 4  109 with 5
times coverage.
These studies suggest that high-resolution single-cell analysis is feasible. However, compared with the aforementioned
technologies, single-cell CTC analyses differ in 4 important
aspects. First, somatic mutations in tumor cells include base
substitutions, indels, structural rearrangements, and changes
in the copy number of DNA segments (12). However, no singlecell approach that effectively combines the reliable mapping of
copy number changes with next-generation sequencing
approaches to detect nucleotide changes has been published
so far. Second, CTCs are extremely rare events and, despite
many efforts (2, 13, 14), there is still a lack of technologies
capable of isolating them in sufﬁcient numbers. As a consequence, usually only very limited numbers of cells are available
for analysis. This excludes the aforementioned strategies, such
as calling mutations only if they are observed in a speciﬁed
number of cells. Third, isolation of CTCs out of millions of
normal cells is a much more complicated procedure than
isolation of cells from a primary tumor or a selection of sperm
cells. Fourth, no suitable material for comparison of CTC
results is available. This is because CTCs may recur years after
initial diagnosis of the primary tumor and may have acquired
multiple novel changes since then. Furthermore, CTCs may be
released from various metastatic sites, and their origin can
usually not be traced. In addition, CTCs have been reported to
be heterogeneous (15–17) and may therefore exhibit a tremendous cell-to-cell variability.

For these reasons, the detailed characterization of CTCs is
still in its infancy. To date, only a few examples exist in which
high-dimensional analyses of individual CTCs were conducted,
and these were analyses of CTC gene expression (18, 19). Here,
we carried out a pilot study to investigate strategies for copy
number analysis and next-generation sequencing of single
CTCs. Our results suggest that complex tumor genomes can
be reconstructed from the peripheral blood of patients with
cancer, and this approach may pave the way for new disease
monitoring strategies.

Materials and Methods
Patients
All patients had advanced-stage [Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (French) stage IV] progressive disease at the time
of blood collection. Clinical characteristics are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. The study was approved by the local
ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained
from all the patients. The patients were seen at the Division of
Clinical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical
University of Graz (Graz, Austria).
Detection of CTCs and whole-genome ampliﬁcation
Blood samples (7.5-mL each) were collected into CellSave
tubes (Veridex, Raritan). The Epithelial Cell Kit (Veridex) was
applied for CTC enrichment and enumeration with the CellSearch system as described previously (20). In brief, in a ﬁrst
step, CTCs were captured by antiepithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) antibody-bearing ferroﬂuid. Subsequent
identiﬁcation of CTCs was based on cytokeratin positivity and
negativity for the leukocyte common antigen CD45. In addition,
40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was done to evaluate
the integrity of the nucleus. The further processing of CTCs is
described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Enrichment of genes and 454 Life Sciences/Roche
Diagnostics
The enrichment of genes and subsequent sequencing is
outlined in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Deep sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq
For validation of "private CTC mutations", i.e., mutations
found in only one CTC, we employed a comparative ultradeep
sequencing approach using the Illumina MiSeq as exempliﬁed
in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
Patients
In this study, we used the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)–approved CellSearch system for CTC detection (20) in 37
patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. In 5 (13.5%) cases,
analysis was not possible due to technical reasons, for example
clotting of the blood. In 11 (29.7%) cases, no CTCs were found, in
15 (40.5%) cases between 1 and 10 CTCs were found, and in 6
(16.2%) cases more than 10 CTCs were identiﬁed. In the latter 6
cases (i.e., patient #6, #9, #18, #22, #26, and #38), we isolated
CTCs for further analyses. For these 6 patients, the interval
between diagnosis of the primary tumor and blood collection to

obtain CTCs varied, with a range from 1 month (patient #9 and
#18) to 3 years and 7 months (45 months, patient #38; mean, 15
months; median, 5 months). In addition, clinical characteristics
of these patients are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Establishment of copy number changes in CTCs
In a next step, we wanted to test whether tumor-speciﬁc copy
number changes are reﬂected in CTCs. To this end, we used our
previously published whole-genome ampliﬁcation (WGA) and
array–comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technologies
for analysis of a single cell or a few cells (21–27). Altogether, we
analyzed 37 CTCs and, as a control, we isolated leukocytes
(CD45-positive cells). As expected, the CD45-positive cells
showed balanced array-CGH proﬁles (data not shown).
Our analysis consisted of several steps, which we carried
out for each CTC of each patient. We use patient #26 as an

example to explain these steps. The primary tumor of
patient #26 had initially been diagnosed and completely
removed 34 months before our analysis. A liver metastasis
was noted and resected 10 months after the initial diagnosis.
Twenty-one months later, metastases were identiﬁed in the
liver, spleen, and bone. We started our analyses by comparing the ratio of the proﬁles of the available tumor material, in
this case, the primary tumor (Fig. 1A), with the liver metastasis (Fig. 1B). We observed several common copy number
changes, including, for example, losses of chromosomes 4,
5q13.2–5q31.2, which harbors the adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) gene, 8p, 17, and 18, and gains of chromosomes 8q,
9, and 20. However, some differences were also observed,
such as losses on chromosomes 10, 11, and 12 or gain of
chromosome 7, which were only present in the metastasis
but not in the primary tumor.

Accordingly, CTCs showed similar copy number changes
compared with both primary tumor and metastasis but also
some others, such as gains of chromosome 10 and 13 in
CTC05 (Fig. 1C). For our array-CGH, we used a 60-K
microarray platform consisting of 59,012 oligonucleotides
for analysis, and we calculated for each of these oligonucleotides whether the ratio values were decreased, balanced, or increased and illustrated the results in heatmaps
(Fig. 1D). Finally, we determined whether the copy number
status for each oligonucleotide occurred only in the respective CTC or also in the primary tumor and/or metastasis
(Fig. 1E). This detailed analysis revealed that the copy
number status of 60.5% of the oligonucleotides on our

array platform was identical in the primary tumor and
metastasis as well as in CTC05 (i.e., of all 59,012 oligonucleotides on our array, 8.7% oligonucleotides showed a loss,
42.9% remained balanced, and 8.9% showed a gain in copy
number status); 9.3% of the oligonucleotides were shared
only by the primary tumor and CTC05, 12.6% were shared
only by the metastasis and CTC05, and 17.6% were unique
to CTC05 (Fig. 1E). These ﬁndings suggested that the
observed changes in the CTC05 were tumor speciﬁc and
consisted of changes also present in the primary tumor and
the liver metastasis, and in addition some other changes.
To investigate the CTC population structure, we extended
these analyses to 10 CTCs from patient #26 (Fig. 2A).

identical changes in both primary tumor and CTC are shown in yellow. Copy number changes, which were observed only in the CTCs but not in
the primary tumor or metastasis, are displayed in gray. On average, for these 10 CTCs, 52.0% (median, 53.4%; range, 37.3%–61.5%) of the copy number
status changes (i.e., gains, losses, and balanced regions) were present in all CTCs, primary tumors, and analyzed metastases; 8.3% (median, 8.2%; range,
6.7%–10.4%) were partially shared between all CTCs and the metastasis only; 14.2% (median, 14.2%; range, 12.0%–16.3%) were partially shared between
the CTCs and primary tumor only; and 25.6% (median, 24.8%; range, 17.6%–41.9%) of all CTC copy number changes were not observed in the primary
tumor or metastasis. B, integer copy number proﬁle of CTC26. C, combined copy number proﬁle representing an average proﬁle from all individual

CTC Analysis by Array-CGH and Next-Generation Sequencing

Furthermore, assuming that single cells would have distinct
copy number states, we calculated integer copy number
proﬁles (Supplementary Methods) for each CTC. This analysis revealed that all 10 CTCs were within the tetraploid
range (e.g., CTC26, Fig. 2B; additional CTCs are depicted in
Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D). To establish the most frequently occurring copy number changes within the CTC
population of patient #26, we constructed an average copy
number proﬁle from all individual CTCs (Supplementary
Methods; Fig. 2C). The "main CTC lineage" differed from the
primary tumor and its metastasis (Fig. 1A and B) by gains on
chromosomes 1q, 6q, and 12p, a high-level gain on chromosome 13, and loss on chromosome 14. When we conducted
hierarchical clustering from the copy number proﬁles (Fig.
2D), the integer copy number proﬁle of one cell (i.e., CTC28;
Supplementary Fig. S1D) deviated from that of the other
cells, suggesting the presence of cells with a "private" pattern
of alterations.

CTCs display multiple colorectal cancer-associated copy
number changes
We extended these analyses to CTCs from the other patients.
In patient #6, we noted extensive differences between the copy
number proﬁles of the primary tumor and its metastasis
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B; details to patient's #6 history
are in Supplementary Information). From patient #6, we
analyzed 9 cells. In 3 cells, we did not ﬁnd the KRAS G12V
mutation previously identiﬁed in the primary tumor, and in
these cells we did not observe any tumor-related copy number
changes. From the 6 other cells that contained the KRAS
mutation, 2 cells were in the diploid range with few copy
number changes, whereas 4 cells were tetraploid and had
multiple copy number changes (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the
average CTC copy number proﬁle (Fig. 3B) differed from the
primary tumor (Supplementary Fig. S2A) by a gain of chromosome 8q, a numerical change that has frequently been
described in colorectal cancer (www.progenetix.net). Our

analyses revealed that the CTCs had more chromosomal copy
number changes in common with the primary tumor than with
the cerebellar metastasis (Fig. 3C). Again, cluster analysis (Fig.
3D) identiﬁed a cell with a "private" copy number proﬁle (i.e.,
CTC14; Supplementary Fig. S2C).
At the time of diagnosis, patient #9 already had metastases
in liver, bone, and abdomen (peritoneal carcinomatosis).
We obtained biopsies from the primary tumor (Supplementary
Fig. S3A) and the peritoneal carcinomatosis (Supplementary
Fig. S3B), which revealed almost identical array-CGH proﬁles
from both sites. We conducted our CTC analyses 1 month
after diagnosis and observed many similarities between the
copy number proﬁles of the CTCs and those from the
primary tumor and peritoneal carcinomatosis, respectively
(Fig. 4).
We analyzed 6 epithelial and CD45-negative cells selected by
the CellSearch system from patient #38 (Supplementary Fig.
S4A and S4B; history in Supplementary Information). However,
we were unable to identify the KRAS G12D mutation, identiﬁed

in the primary tumor, in any of these cells. Furthermore, all of
these cells had a balanced proﬁle.
In 2 further cases (#18, #22) only small biopsies were taken at
the time of diagnosis, so that insufﬁcient material was available
to analyze the primary tumor for comparison. However, in
their CTCs, we again identiﬁed multiple copy number changes
associated with colorectal cancer (as documented at www.
progenetix.net). For example, in patient #22, one CTC revealed
losses on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 8p, and 18 and gains on
chromosomes 7p, 17q, and 20 (Supplementary Fig. S5; CTC03).
Sequencing of the ultraconserved region UCR41 in CTCs
To establish appropriate CTC sequencing strategies, we
selected CTCs from patients #6 and #26 because we had the
largest CTC number for these 2 patients. However, sequencing
of single-cell ampliﬁcation products can be prone to experimental and technical errors (9–11). To address this issue, we
exploited ultraconserved regions (UCR), which represent genomic regions that do not accumulate true mutations (28). Thus,

CTC Analysis by Array-CGH and Next-Generation Sequencing

all sequence variations in UCRs should represent bona ﬁde
errors, making UCRs an ideal control for DNA ampliﬁcation
and sequencing errors (28). Therefore, we sequenced the
ultraconserved region UCR41 (ref. 29; Supplementary Fig. S6,
green bar), its adjacent extremely conserved region (Supplementary. Fig. S6, gray bar), and nonconserved ﬂanking regions
(28) and analyzed 5 cells each from healthy male and female
controls. The only sequence variant in single cells from healthy
controls was at single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs17701179, where the male donor had A/G alleles, which we
also identiﬁed in each of his 5 single cells (Supplementary Fig.
S6, blue arrows).
Next, we analyzed the constitutional DNA, primary tumor,
metastasis, and all the CTCs from patients #6 (n ¼ 4) and #26
(n ¼ 10), using the same procedure. Again, we found no
sequence variation in the ultraconserved or extremely conserved regions. However, we identiﬁed 2 variations in the
nonconserved ﬂanking regions. One was in the metastasis
sample from patient #6 (Supplementary Fig. S6, right red
arrow), in which the sample had not been subjected to WGA
but only to the ampliﬁcation steps necessary for the targeted
gene enrichment. The second variation was in one of the 10
CTCs from patient #26 (CTC21; Supplementary Fig. S6, left
red arrow). Both of these variants were within a region that
seems to have increased mutability compared with the average mutability (28). Furthermore, patient #6 had constitutional A/G alleles for SNP rs3910657; however, we identiﬁed
A/A in CTC7 and G/G in CTC14. Our results suggest that,
despite the ampliﬁcation steps involved in our protocol, no
sequencing artifacts occurred in this ultraconserved region.
Mutation spectrum in primary tumors, metastases, and
CTCs
We then aimed at establishing a mutation spectrum for a
panel of 68 colorectal cancer-related genes (Supplementary
Table S2) that are frequently (> 3%) mutated in colorectal
cancer according to the COSMIC database. We analyzed these
68 genes in the different samples, including constitutional DNA,
the primary tumors, and their metastases in patients #6 and #26.
In addition, we sequenced 3 CTCs (7, 13, and 14) from patient #6
and 5 CTCs (5, 21, 22, 24, and 28) from patient #26.
A total of 959,790 and 2,070,381 sequences were generated
for the formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) pool (tumor
and metastasis of patient #6 and #26) and the 2 CTC pools
(pool 1: CTC 7, 13, 14 from patient #6 and CTC 5 from patient
#26; pool 2: CTC 21, 22, 24, 28 from patient #26), respectively.
Read length was remarkably consistent throughout the experiment. The average read length was 232 bp for the FFPE material
and 329 bp for the CTCs, and the total yield from the sequencing
run was 223 Mb for the 4 FFPE samples and 683 Mb for the 8
CTCs. The average coverage of tumors and metastases (24)
was lower as compared with the CTCs (41). Sequencing of
enriched CTCs achieved more on-target reads (55.6%) than did
sequencing of the FFPE material (41.5%).
With the exception of an exonic deletion in ERCC6L in
patient #6 and a 1-bp insertion in MLH1 in patient #26 (in
CTC28), all identiﬁed insertions and deletions were found only
in introns. We focused our analysis on exonic, nonsynonymous

www.aacrjournals.org

variants not included in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information dbSNP build 132 database. In the initial screen, we
found 25 mutations in 17 genes in at least one of the analyzed
samples of patients #6 and 22 mutations in 10 genes in patient
#26. Sanger sequencing conﬁrmed 16 and 15 mutations in
patients #6 (Fig. 5A) and #26 (Fig. 5B), respectively (Supplementary Table S3). In patient #6, 4 of these mutations were
constitutional and therefore found in all the samples. This
patient also had 3 somatic mutations in known colorectal
cancer driver genes (i.e., in APC, KRAS, and PIK3CA), which
were present in all the tumor samples including CTCs. Interestingly, we found 2 additional mutations in the cerebellar
metastasis in NF1 and TP53, which we also detected in the 3
CTCs. The other mutations found were present only in single
CTCs examined (Fig. 5A).
In patient #26, we identiﬁed one constitutional mutation in
all analyzed samples. However, within our panel of genes, we
did not ﬁnd any other mutation present in all samples (Fig. 5B).
However, array-CGH had identiﬁed a deletion on chromosome
5 harboring the APC gene in all tumor samples, and therefore in
this case copy number changes may indicate genomic regions,
which had been involved in tumor initiation and/or progression. In patient #26, we again identiﬁed "private mutations,"
deﬁned as mutations observed in only one CTC but not in any
other tumor material. Because of the high experimental error
rate of single-cell analysis, we carried out additional experiments to address the nature of these mutations as outlined
below.
Most private CTC mutations are present at a subclonal
level in the primary tumor
We reasoned that mutations found in only one CTC could be
ampliﬁcation/sequencing artifacts or mutations already present in the primary tumor or metastasis at subclonal level and
therefore they could have been missed by our initial sequencing efforts. To address this question, we conducted ultradeep
sequencing of the primary tumors, metastases, and normal
tissues to test whether private CTC mutations might reﬂect
subclonal mutations. Subclonal single-nucleotide variants
were detected and quantiﬁed with the deep single-nucleotide variant (SNV) algorithm, an approach capable of detecting variants with frequencies as low as one per 10,000 alleles
(30). These analyses revealed that from 20 analyzable private
CTC mutations (one variant was not ampliﬁable), 17 (85%)
were present in at least one other corresponding sample (i.e.,
primary tumor or metastasis) with mutation frequencies
ranging from 0.02 to 0.42 (Fig. 5; Table 1). For the remaining
mutations, it is impossible to decide whether these are true
mutations occurring with allele frequencies below the resolution limits of current detection methods or if they are
ampliﬁcation or sequencing artifacts.
Correlation with clinical parameters and potential
clinical applications
Although this was a pilot study, we then attempted to
investigate whether the identiﬁed set of genetic aberrations
could potentially be informative for identifying rational
therapies currently available or in clinical trials. Mutations

Figure 5. Summary of mutations identiﬁed in patients #6 (A) and #26 (B) in the respective analyzed material. Somatic mutations found in all tumor samples are
indicated in red, mutations are shown in blue if they were present in all samples except the primary tumor, and the other mutations are shown in
black. The constitutional mutation, which we identiﬁed in patient #26, is shown in green. Mutations occurring in only one CTC, for which deep sequencing did
not provide evidence for existence at a subclonal level in the primary tumor or metastasis, are shown in gray. The tables highlight mutations or copy number
changes of particular biologic or clinical interest. The column "Copy number CTCs" refers to the average copy number of all analyzed CTCs.

of biologic or predictive relevance are listed in Fig. 5A and B.
For example, 2 mutations in patient #6 are of clinical
relevance, i.e., KRAS p.G12V (resistant to EGFR monoclonal
antibodies) and PIK3CA p.E542K [an exon 9 activating
mutation; possible predictor for EGFR antibodies and/or
insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1R inhibitors; ref. 31].
Although the CTC analysis conﬁrmed that these mutations
were still present 8 months after diagnosis, it did not reveal
novel targets for therapeutic interventions as compared with
the analysis of the primary tumor. In contrast, in patient #26,
we identiﬁed cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) ampliﬁcation on chromosome 13q12.13 in 9 of 10 CTCs that was not
present in the parts of the primary tumor or metastasis that
we analyzed. This ampliﬁcation may represent a viable
target for CDK inhibitors, which are currently in clinical
trials (32–34).

Discussion
A major goal of cancer medicine is to move from ﬁxed
treatment regimens to therapies tailored to a patient's
individual tumor. In this study, we addressed whether
complex tumor genomes can be inferred noninvasively from
CTCs of patients with cancer. Detailed characterization of
CTCs may provide the opportunity for clinical impact in
the treatment of selected cancers in which appropriate
targeting of tumor-associated genetic lesions is critical.
Such an approach would allow monitoring of tumor genomes with an unprecedented resolution. However, the
science of CTCs is still in its infancy. Little is known about
the biology of these cells, and only recently technologic
advances have provided a window into the composition of
this rare cell population, allowing molecularly designed
analyses (18, 19).

The importance of a molecular characterization of these
cells is underlined by the fact that we had 9 epithelial and
CD45-negative cells selected by the CellSearch system (3 from
patient #6 and 6 from patient #9), in which we did not ﬁnd the
KRAS mutation previously identiﬁed in the respective primary
tumors and which each had a balanced copy number
proﬁle. Formally, we cannot exclude that these cells are CTCs;
however, alternatively these cells could be circulating epithelial
cells, which have recently been described in patients with
benign colon diseases (35). Thus, a simple enumeration of
epithelial, CD45-negative cells without molecular characterization for prognostic purposes may in some cases be
erroneous.
Although the CellSearch system used for CTC enrichment
has been cleared by the FDA, it has shortcomings, as the
enrichment is based on EpCAM expression of CTCs and
EpCAM-negative CTCs are missed. Increasing evidence suggests that EpCAM-negative CTCs might have undergone an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process linked to the

www.aacrjournals.org

stemness of cancer cells and increased chemoresistance (36).
Other emerging CTC isolation techniques, including nonEpCAM or size-based enrichment approaches (5), have the
advantage of assessing the relevant genomic changes in a
broader range of CTC subsets. However, these new CTC assays
have not been validated to a comparable level as the CellSearch
system with regard to their speciﬁcity, reproducibility, and
clinical relevance so far. Moreover, recent reports indicate that
carcinoma cells have to express epithelial markers (such as
EpCAM) to colonize distant organs and to form overt metastases (36).
We applied our single-cell technologies (21–27) to a detailed
analysis of CTCs and showed for the ﬁrst time that mutation
analysis of multiple genes by next-generation sequencing in
combination with establishing the copy number status is
feasible from CTCs. Our strategy differs from other recently
published single-cell approaches as these have shortcomings
for the analysis of rare cell events. For example, single-cell
sequencing (8) allows only assessment of copy number changes

but not of changes at the nucleotide level. The single-cell
exome sequencing methods (9, 10) deﬁned true mutations
only if they occurred in a speciﬁed number of cancer cells. This
is applicable for the analysis of cells from a primary tumor, in
which a virtually unlimited number of cells is available for
analysis, but not for rare events, such as CTCs, in which
frequently less than 5 cells with sufﬁcient quality are available.
Furthermore, this approach does not allow a genome-wide
measurement of copy number changes. The single-cell wholegenome analysis presented by Wang and colleagues (11) seems
to be especially attractive as it may signiﬁcantly reduce the
false-discovery rate. However, it is currently unknown whether
the microﬂuidic device used by these authors is applicable to
the identiﬁcation and isolation of CTCs. Very recently, a new
ampliﬁcation method offering high uniformity across the
genome and also allowing both the genome-wide detection
of single-nucleotide and copy-number variations of a single
human cell has been reported (37, 38). Although this new
ampliﬁcation method has not been applied to CTCs yet, it
seems to have great potential to advance CTC research further.
In any case, the aforementioned studies have documented
that single-cell analysis is prone to artifacts, which may be
introduced either during ampliﬁcation or sequencing (9–
11, 37, 38). To address this issue, we made use of a comparative
sequencing strategy. This strategy involved reanalysis of the
primary tumor and metastasis by deep sequencing. The same
genomic region was compared between a heterogeneous test
sample (i.e., tumor and metastasis) and a homogeneous control sample (i.e., normal tissue). Sequencing results were
evaluated with deepSNV (30). With these sequencing efforts
and statistical evaluations, variants occurring with allele frequencies ranging from 0.0002 to 0.34 can be identiﬁed in a
heterogeneous tissue (30). Interestingly, these analyses suggested that the majority of private CTC mutations had already
been present at a subclonal level in the primary tumor.
Therefore the majority of these variants were likely true
mutations and not artifacts.
Our study suggests that we can elucidate relevant changes in
the tumor genome that had either not been present or not been
observed at the time of initial diagnosis. Thus, an important
application may be the detailed reevaluation of patients
enrolled in clinical trials for novel substances. For example,
analysis of the genomes of the primary tumor and metastasis of
patient #26 did not reveal changes that would have made her
eligible for enrollment in a trial with a CDK inhibitor such as
ﬂavopiridol (32–34). Yet, the CTCs obtained 34 and 24 months
after diagnosis of the primary tumor and liver metastasis,
respectively, revealed a high level of ampliﬁcation of CDK8,
which had not been noted in the previous analyses. CDK8 has
been described as a positive regulator of catenin signaling
in 15% to 20% of colorectal cancers (39). Furthermore, CDK8
inhibition suppresses damage-induced tumor-promoting

paracrine activities of tumor cells, and it has recently been
reported that CDK8 inhibitors offer a promising approach to
increase the efﬁcacy of cancer chemotherapy (40). Therefore
this ampliﬁcation may represent a viable target for CDK
inhibitors, which are currently in clinical trials (32–34).
Although we cannot yet provide treatment outcomes, patient
#26 may serve as an example of the impact of reevaluation of
the tumor genome status on treatment decisions.
The next challenge will be to test such approaches for the
serial monitoring of patients with cancer and to evaluate
their potential for the early-stage analysis of peripheral
blood. However, our proof-of-concept study suggests that
minimal invasive access to tumor material immediately
before speciﬁc antitumor treatment initiation in advanced
cases may become possible for reevaluation of the cancer
genome and possibly tailored management of treatment
choices.
