ABSTRACT
Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a constituent of many cruciferous vegetables exhibits
significant anticancer activities in many cancer models. Our studies provide novel
insights into AITC-induced anticancer mechanisms in human A549 and H1299 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. AITC exposure induced replication stress in
NSCLC cells as evidenced by γH2AX and FANCD2 foci, ATM/ATR-mediated checkpoint
responses and S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, AITC-induced FANCD2 foci
displayed co-localization with BrdU foci, indicating stalled or collapsed replication
forks in these cells. Although PITC (phenyl isothiocyanate) exhibited concentrationdependent cytotoxic effects, treatment was less effective compared to AITC.
Previously, agents that induce cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phases were shown to
sensitize tumor cells to radiation. Similar to these observations, combination therapy
involving AITC followed by radiation treatment exhibited increased DDR and cell killing
in NSCLC cells compared to single agent treatment. Combination index (CI) analysis
revealed synergistic effects at multiple doses of AITC and radiation, resulting in CI
values of less than 0.7 at Fa of 0.5 (50% reduction in survival). Collectively, these
studies identify an important anticancer mechanism displayed by AITC, and suggest
that the combination of AITC and radiation could be an effective therapy for NSCLC.

and End Results (SSER), early detection of NSCLC
significantly improves overall survival rate. However, the
mortality rate for early diagnosed patients (stage I & II) is
still more than 50%. A significant advance in the treatment
of NSCLC is molecular profiling based classification of
tumor types and direct use of molecularly targeted therapies
[3–6]. Unfortunately, targeted therapies are only beneficial
in a subset of patients and their long-term use often leads to
resistance and recurrence of advanced disease [7, 8]. While
it is important to develop more advanced early detection
methods, prevention of NSCLC in high-risk individuals and
development of new and effective therapeutic strategies is a
high priority for public health [9].
Although radiation therapy remains an important
treatment regimen for local control of the early-stage,

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer represents a leading cause of cancerrelated mortalities worldwide. More than 200,000 lung
cancer cases are diagnosed each year in the United
States alone that accounts for over 160,000 deaths [1].
Approximately 85% of the lung cancer cases are classified
as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is closely
linked to smoking or exposure to environmental carcinogens
(ex. asbestos, radon, industrial chemicals, etc.) [2, 1].
Regardless of the advances in knowledge of pulmonary
carcinogenesis and the development of novel targeted
therapies, the overall 5-year survival rate of NSCLC
patients is only 15%. According to the data from National
Lung Cancer Trial (NLCT) and Surveillance, Epidemiology

as well as advanced NSCLC, the response rate to
radiation among NSCLC patients is highly variable and
in the majority of cases, the tumor spreads to distant
tissues [7–9]. Though existing guidelines suggest that
chemotherapy in combination with radiation can improve
survival rates, most patients either do not qualify for this
modality or need to go on salvage therapy that requires
additional chemotherapy or radiation, which compromises
their quality of life and overall survival. Moreover, this
variance is also observed in clinical toxicity data of
NSCLC patients experiencing treatment related toxicities
and effects. Therefore, considering the heterogeneity
of response to radiation and chemotherapy, as well as
their related toxicities, the development of methods and
therapeutic strategies that predict clinical outcome of
the disease would significantly benefit the patients [9].
An approach to solve this problem is the use of agents
that exhibit tumor specific cytotoxicities that potentiate
radiation-induced cell death [9].
Dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs), such as allyl
isothicyanate (AITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC)
and sulfurophane (SFN) have been well studied as
chemopreventive agents in animal models of several
cancers, including lung cancer [10–14]. Data from
epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of
cruciferous vegetables may lower the overall incidence of
cancer. These studies also suggest that a diet rich in ITCs
can lower the incidence of lung cancer in current smokers
[12, 15, 16]. The mode of action for the chemopreventive
activity of dietary ITCs is mainly attributed to
detoxification of carcinogens through activation of nuclear
factor erythroid-related factor2 (Nrf2), which triggers
the expression of phase II enzymes [17, 18]. However,
it is obvious from several recent studies that carcinogen
detoxification through phase II enzymes may not be the
only mechanism by which these compounds prevent
cancer. For example, feeding of ITCs several weeks after
the exposure to carcinogen prevented tumor initiation in
murine models [16]. Likewise, administration of ITCs
markedly decreased tumor incidence in animal models
that spontaneously develop tumors, in which no external
carcinogen is involved [17, 18, 19]. Moreover, numerous
studies in human tumor xenograft models and tumor
cell lines demonstrated tumor-specific growth inhibitory
properties for ITCs [20, 21]. Increasing evidence is
also available for their ability to cause cell cycle arrest,
induce apoptosis, suppress IκB and Nf-κB (nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling
and binding to thiol-reactive groups of several cellular
targets such as DNA topoisomerase 2, p53 and tubulins
[18, 21, 22, 23]. These studies strongly advocate for the
existence of additional mechanisms that are independent
from carcinogen detoxification for their cancer preventive
properties.

The above observations suggest that ITCs may
have several cellular targets in proliferating tumor
cells and their interference could induce DNA damage
and cell cycle arrest. In this study we studied the cell
cycle checkpoint and DNA damage response (DDR)
and repair pathways elicited by the dietary ITC, allyl
isothiocyanate and compared these responses with PITC
(phenyl isothiocyanate), a synthetic ITC. These studies
demonstrated that AITC induces replication-associated
DNA damage and affects cells cycle progression through
S-phase that lead to G2 accumulation. Further evaluation
of combination therapy with radiation revealed that AITC
could be a radiation sensitizing agent and this combination
demonstrates synergistic therapeutic activity against
NSCLC cells.

RESULTS
AITC and PITC exhibits chemotherapeutic
activities against NSCLC cells
To assess the antineoplastic activities of dietary
isothiocyanate AITC and synthetic isothiocyanate PITC
against human NSCLC cells, A549 and H1299 lung tumor
cells were exposed to different concentrations of the ITCs
and their effects on tumor cell growth were measured by
clonogenic survival assays. Clonogenic potential of the
NSCLC cell lines, A549 and H1299 were significantly
affected by both AITC and PITC in a concentrationdependent manner (Figures 1A and 1B). The IC50 values
for AITC and PITC were 10 and 15 μM against A549 cells
and 5 and 7.5 μM for H1299 cells, respectively. When
compared, AITC exhibited superior growth inhibitory
properties than PITC in both the NSCLC cell lines.
Between the two NSCLC cell lines used, H1299 cells
were more sensitive to ITCs compared to A549 cells.
These inherent differences in sensitivities between the cell
lines may be attributed to their genetic (ex. p53 status)
and epigenetic profiles. Moreover, ITCs were shown to
exhibit their cytotoxic effects selectively towards tumor
cells in several cancer models [23, 24]. Consistent with
these studies, both the ITCs exhibited growth inhibitory
effects selectively towards cancer cells when compared
with normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs).
Similar to the clonogenic survival data (Figure 1A and
1B), AITC exhibited significant growth inhibitory affects
at 5 and 10 μM concentrations to both the NSCLC cells
(Figure 1C and 1D). Although PITC affects were minimal
at 5 μM concentration, it exhibited significant growth
inhibitory properties at 10 μM concentration to both A549
(Figure 1C) and H1299 (Figure 1C) cells. However, toxic
effects of the ITCs used were minimal towards HBECs
even at 10 μM concentration (Figure 1D), suggesting their
selectivity towards tumor cells.

cell viability was assessed using Tryphan blue exclusion assay. Data presented are an average of triplicates and ± SD presented as error bars

AITC treatment slows S-phase progression and

cycle arrest at this concentration. A similar pattern of cell
cycle distribution was observed in A549 cells (Figure S1A).
These variations in the cell cycle distribution for AITC and
PITC indicate either they have differential binding affinities
to their targets or they may have different cellular targets.
However, their ability to inhibit S-phase progression
indicates that ITCs may interfere with DNA replication
directly or they may induce replication-associated DNA
damage, which in turn can activate checkpoint responses
to inhibit the progression of cell cycle.

To gain further insight into the mechanism of their
anti-proliferative activities, H1299 cells were treated with
either AITC or PITC (20 μM) and their effect on cell
cycle progression and distributions were assessed at 6
and 24 hours post-treatment. Exposure of NSCLC cells to
AITC and PITC attenuated cell cycle progression through
S-phase, as indicated by increased accumulation of cells
in S-phase within 6 hours when compared to DMSO
(Dimethyl sulfoxide) treated cells (Figure 2A, top panel and
Figure 2B). However, longer time incubation (24 hours)
exhibited differential responses. As shown in the Figures
(Figure 2A, bottom panel and Figure 2C), at 24 hour time
point, AITC treated cells accumulated in G2/M phases,

cells were exposed to AITC and PITC and assessed
for the replication stress-mediated DDR proteins by
immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 3,
exposure of H1299 cells to AITC for 6 hours induced a
robust increase in γH2AX (phosphorylated form of histone
2 variant X at Serine 139) foci (Figure 3A) and FANCD2
(Fanconi anemia, complementation group D2) foci
(Figure 3B) compared to DMSO treated cells. AITC
treated cells exhibited over a 4 and 3 fold increase in
γH2AX foci and FANCD2 foci positive cells, respectively
(Figures 3C and 3D). Similar results were observed in
A549 cells treated with AITC (Figures S3A and S3B).
It is well known that Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair
pathway proteins associates with replication machinery
and forms foci at the stalled or collapsed replication forks
[25, 26]. To assess this, we transiently labeled the cells
with BrdU and assessed the localization of BrdU and
FANCD2 foci. As expected, DMSO treated cells showed
few FANCD2 foci positive cells and most of the cells
exhibited pan nuclear staining (Figure 3B). Consistent
with γH2AX foci formation, cells exposed to AITC
induced robust FANCD2 foci formation. Interestingly,
most of the FANCD2 foci formed in AITC treated cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exhibited co-localized with BrdU foci (Figure 3B),
indicating stalled or collapsed replication forks in these
cells. Additionally, as revealed by the flow cytometry
analysis, ITCs treated cells exhibited increased number
of EdU positive cells at 6 hours’ time point, indicating
transient accumulation of cells in S-phase (Figure S5).
Together these results indicate that exposure of NSCLC
cells to AITC induces replication stress-associated DDR,
which slows cell cycle progression though S-phase
and accumulates them in G2/M phases. Furthermore,
AITC-induced cytotoxicity was dramatically reduced
when NSCLC cells were pretreated with aphidicolin, an
inhibitor of DNA replication (Figure S4A and S4B). These
results further suggest that AITC-induced cytotoxicity is at
least partly dependent on active replication.
Replication stress is known to induce DNA
damage due to the stalled or collapsed forks, which then
activates ATM/ATR-mediated cell cycle checkpoint
responses to promote fork stability and restart thorough
Rad18 and Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathways
(monoubiquitinated FANCD2) [26]. To test whether ITCs
also induce replication stress-associated DDR, A549 and
H1299 cells were exposed to 20 μM AITC or PITC. After

FANCD2 foci (D) were presented in histograms. To assess the co-localization of FANCD2 foci with replication forks, cells were labeled

the indicated times of exposure (6 and 24 hours), whole
cell lysates were normalized for protein concentrations and
probed for different DDR proteins. Consistent with the cell
cycle and immunofluorescence data, NSCLC cells treated
with the AITC and PITC induced ATM/ATR-mediated
DDR as evidenced by phosphorylation of ATM, ATR, p53
and Chk1 (Figures 4A–4C and 5A–5C), and induced the
expression of replication stress-associated DNA repair
proteins such as Rad18 (Figures 4A), mono-ubiquitinated
FANCD2 (Figures 3 and 4A) and γH2AX (Figures 3, 5A
and S3). Consistent with the differences observed in the
cell survival and cell cycle data, H1299 cells treated with
PITC exhibited reduced phosphorylated ATM compared to
A549 cells (Figure 5A and 5B). However, the persistence
of phosphorylated ATR after 24 hour drug treatment
indicates the activated DDR in these cells, which might
contribute to slow progression through cell cycle (Figure 2,
S1A and S2B), DNA repair (Figures 3, 4 and 5) and
cell death pathways (Figure 7, Figure S2A). However,
careful evaluation of replication dynamics in the context
of individual ITC exposure and DNA repair events
would be important to give more detailed information
of their cellular effects. Similar to the cell cycle profiles
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 2 and S1), expression levels of cyclin E and cyclin
B correlated in response to both the ITCs at 6 and 24 hours
(Figure 4A and S1B).

AITC inhibits migration of NSCLC cells
To assess whether AITC also affects cell migration,
which is an indication of EMT and aggressive behavior
of malignant disease, we performed scratch assays or
wound healing assay using A549 cells and measured
the cell migration by time lapse images up to 24 hours.
As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, AITC significantly
inhibited migration of A549 cells following 24 hours
of treatment. The effect of PITC on cell migration was
minimal compared to AITC at the concentrations used
in this study (20 μM). The percentage of migration area
covered after 24 hrs was almost 100% for DMSO treated
control cells, while 21.1% and 80.9% for the cells treated
with AITC and PITC respectively. We also observed that
the rate of wound healing was faster in PITC treated cells
compared to the cells treated with AITC. These results
clearly indicate that the percentage of migration area of
the AITC treated cells was significantly lower than that of

patients, whose lung cancers are limited to the chest but
cannot be resected surgically. In order to study the effect
of AITC treatment in combination with radiation, we
determined the most effective doses for combining the
two agents. Briefly, A549 and H1299 cells were pretreated
with a fixed concentration of AITC for overnight and
exposed to varying doses (0.5Gy to 6Gy) of radiation
and allowed to form colonies. The survival fraction of
the cells were measured by counting the colonies (>25
cells) after 10 days. The impact of AITC and radiationinduced cytotoxicity is depicted in Figures 8A and 8B. The
combination of AITC and radiation indicated increased
cytotoxicity compared to the single agents (radiation alone
or AITC treatment alone) against NSCLC cells. Consistent
with the survival data, combination treatment also induced
increased γH2AX and phosphorylated Chk1 in these cells
(Figure 8C). Based on these results, we hypothesized that
AITC may have synergistic effect on radiation therapy.
To further evaluate the combination therapy, a fixed AITC
and radiation ratio was selected (AITC:IR) and used in
further experiments. From these values, combination index
(CI) values were calculated to quantitatively measure
the potential for additive, synergistic, or antagonistic
interactions. To further evaluate the combination therapy
of AITC and radiation, the percent of survival fraction
by either agent alone was quantified comparing to
untreated cells. Similarly, reduction in survival fraction
by combination of AITC and radiation treatment was
also calculated. From these values, combination index
(CI) values were calculated using CalcuSyn software.
As  shown in the isobolograms for A549 and H1299
(Figures 9A and 9B respectively), combination of AITC
pre-treatment with radiation resulted in more-than-additive

AITC induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells
To assess whether AITC-induced replication
associated DDR and G2/M cell cycle arrest leads to
apoptosis in NSCLC cells, we measured percent of cells
undergoing apoptosis using annexin-V staining followed
by flow cytometry analysis. First, we evaluated the
concentration dependent effects of AITC on cell cycle
and proapoptotic markers after 24 hours exposure. These
results clearly demonstrated concentration dependent
increase in proapoptotic proteins (Figure S2A) and
cell cycle arrest in A549 cells (Figure S2B). To further
evaluate A549 and H1299 cells were exposed to AITC
and the cells undergoing apoptosis were assessed after 24
and 48 hours post treatment. As shown in the Figure 7A
(top panel), AITC treatment induced about a 3 and 4 fold
increase in annexin-V positive cells at 24 and 48 hours in
A549 cells (Figure 7B), respectively. Similar results were
observed in H1299 cells treated with AITC (Figures 7A
bottom panel and 7C).

AITC exhibits synergistic therapeutic effects on
NSCLC cell lines in combination with radiation
It is evident from several studies that agents that
arrest cells in S and G2/M phases work synergistically
with radiation therapy, an important treatment regimen
used for local and advanced lung cancer [27]. Radiation
therapy becomes the primary option for lung cancer

cell killing in both of the NSCLC cell lines. Since this
suggested synergistic cell killing, we next examined
the ability of AITC to synergize with radiation using
the Chou-Talalay synergy analysis method as described
previously [28]. The isobolograms were drawn for these
values, representing 50%, 75% and 90% growth inhibition
(ED) for both A549 and H1299 cells (Figures 9A and 9B).
As indication by CI plots (Figures 9C and 9D), AITC and
radiation combination treatment synergistically killed both
the NSCLC cell lines at most fractions affected (Fa). The
CI values for the fraction affected (Fa) at ED50, ED75
and ED90 are all < 1 for both A549 and H1299 cell lines
(Table 1). These results indicate that AITC could be a
potential radiation sensitizing agent for the treatment of
NSCLC.
To further evaluate these synergistic cytotoxic
effects of AITC and radiation, and if combination therapy
is due to increased DNA damage, we further evaluated
DDR markers. A549 cells were treated with either 10 μM
AITC or DMSO and exposed to different doses of IR.
Consistent with the survival data, combined treatment of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AITC and radiation elicited increased levels of DDR, as
evidenced by increased levels of γH2AX, FANCD2 and
pChk1 proteins compared to control and individual agents
treated cells. These data suggest that AITC pre-treatment
in combination with radiation therapy may result in a more
pronounced therapeutic activity in NSCLC.

DISCUSSION
AITC is a naturally occurring isothiocynate, which
is abundant in many cruciferous vegetables that have been
extensively evaluated for their chemopreventive properties
in several cancer models [29]. However, the mechanism
for the ITC-induced antitumor activities is not well defined
and numerous pathways have been implicated. Studies
on many tumor cell models have demonstrated that their
antineoplastic effects are at least partly due to the G2/M
cell cycle arrest and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
[29, 30, 31, 32]. It is evident from several investigations
that ITCs cause change in redox potential, inhibit cellular
enzymes such as DNA topoisomerases, tubulins and

affect regulation of several genes in tumor cell survival
and growth [18, 21–24 , 30]. Recently, several studies
also indicated that AITC and related ITCs induces DNA
damage and cell cycle arrest in tumor cells [18, 21, 22,
32, 33]. However, these agents are highly reactive and
may influence the function and stability of many proteins
in the cells, which makes it difficult to predict the
specific cellular targets that are responsible for inducing
DNA damage [23, 31, 32]. In this regard, we primarily
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

focused our studies on DNA damage mediated effects
of AITC on NSCLC cells and extended this knowledge
in the context of cancer therapeutics. In our studies,
naturally occurring AITC and the synthetic PITC both
showed chemotherapeutic properties against NSCLC
cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly,
our results demonstrated that AITC interfere with cell
cycle progression by inducing replication-associated
DNA damage, as evidenced by γH2AX and FANCD2
5247

Oncotarget

(Figures 3, 4, 5 and S3). Consistent with the effects of
S-phase poison CPT (Figure S1B and S1C), exposure of
cells to AITC activated ATM/ATR mediated cell cycle
checkpoint responses that attenuated NSCLC cells’
progression through S-phase leading to their accumulation
in G2/M phase. Importantly, most of the AITC-induced
FANCD2 nuclear foci co-localized with BrdU foci, a
nucleoside analogue and marker of active replication.
Moreover, the appearance of DDR signals within 6 hours
of ITCs exposure implies that these agents are potent DNA
damage inducing agents. Together, these data suggests
that AITC induces replication associated DNA damage in
NSCLC cells, which might be a possible reason that their
cytotoxic effects are specific to tumor cells [33, 34].
It is evident from several studies that the
chemotherapeutic activities of various ITCs are highly
variable based on the tumor model studied and in some
cases different cell lines within the same tumor model
[23, 30, 32, 35, 38]. Though both AITC and PITC
induced replication associated DDR in NSCLC cells,
PITC was less effective in inducing cell cycle arrest
and other growth inhibitory properties. Similar results
were observed previously using PITC in prostate cancer
cells when compared with naturally occurring phenethyl
isothiocyanate (PEITC) [31].
Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway plays an
important role in maintaining genome integrity by closely
associating with replication machinery to stabilize stalled
replication forks and facilitating the repair of collapsed
forks by homologous recombination mediated repair
[39]. We and others have previously shown that agents
which perturb DNA replication or induce replication
stress can activate the FA pathway, resulting in monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and its nuclear foci formation
[25, 26, 37, 39, 40]. Consistent with these studies, AITC
exposure activated FA pathway, replication-associated
DDR, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These
results indicate that AITC can induce potentially lethal
S-phase specific DNA lesions such as those induced by
S-phase specific poison camptothecin [36, 42, 44, 45, 48].
Consistent with the camptothecin induced cellular
responses (Figure S1B and S1C) and as described [42],
inhibition of replication by aphidicolin markedly reduced
AITC-induced cytotoxicity (Figure S4). Recently, Geng
and colleagues reported similar observations, where
hydroxy urea pretreatment abrogated AITC-induced
apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells [43]. Together,
these observations suggest that ITCs-induced DDR closely
resemble to the S-phase specific poison camptothecininduced DDR, a DNA topoisomerase 1 targeting
anticancer agent (Figure S1B and S1C) [26, 42, 45].
Radiation therapy is a very common curative
therapy for treatment of lung cancer, especially for patients
whose lung cancers are limited to the chest but cannot be
removed surgically. Though the mechanisms of radiation

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitizers are not fully known, it is plausible that they
possess this activity by enhancing the damage induced
by radiation or modulating the cell cycle distribution into
the phases that are more vulnerable to radiation [45–48].
Previous studies demonstrated that cells in G0 or G1 are
less sensitive to ionizing radiation [45], indicating agents
that can alter the distribution of the cells into S and G2/M
phases could be more susceptible to radiation [27]. This
has been proven in many tumor models including NSCLC
cancer using DNA topoisomerase 1 (Top1) poisons
such as camptothecin (CPT) [45, 46, 48]. The radiation
sensitization properties of these agents were attributed to
induction of low dose DNA damage in replicating cells
that slows the cells cycle progression through S-phase and
arrest them in G2/M phase. This was further confirmed
because only pre-treated cells but not the post-treated cells
exhibited radiation sensitivity [48].
Since dietary AITC demonstrated replicationassociated DDR and cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phases
similar to those observed in response to topoisomerase-1
inhibitors, we further assessed whether these agents
could be radiosensitizers in NSCLC cells [46]. As
hypothesized, pretreatment of cells with a sub-lethal dose
(5 μM) of AITC, remarkably hyper-sensitized A549 and
H1299 cells compared to radiation treatment alone. The
radiosensitizing effect of AITC was very significant in
exhibiting synergic interactions as indicated in the Figure 9
and Table 1. As AITC is a dietary constituent of many
vegetables and highly bioavailable, its therapeutic use
may be well tolerated compared to other chemotherapeutic
drugs. Moreover, several studies in animal models
demonstrated AITC causes minimal adverse effects at
much higher doses then the concentrations used in this
study [49, 50]. In summary, these data provide compelling
evidence that dietary ITCs such as AITC can induce
replication stress in NSCLC cells by generating forkstalling DNA lesions. Importantly, these data establish a
strong basis for the preclinical evaluation of AITC and
other dietary isothiocyanates in combination with radiation
therapy in treatment of NSCLC. Since radiation therapy
remains the common treatment method for standard of
care therapy for NSCLC, we propose that AITC and other
dietary isothiocyanates may provide important therapeutic
effects, in combination with radiation to eliminate locally
advanced and refractory NSCLC tumors.

METHODS
Cell lines and antibody
The NSCLC cell lines A549 (human adenocarcinoma
epithelial cell line) and H1299 (human were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with
10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 100 U/ml
penicillin. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were

5248

Oncotarget

grown in BEGM™ Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth
Medium as described previously [51]. Cells were routinely
tested for mycoplasma contamination using Mycotest kit
(Invitrogen) and cells within 10 passages were used in
the experiments. AITC and PITC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
stock solutions were prepared by dissolving in anhydrous
DMSO and stored at −20°C. These stock solutions were
further diluted to required concentration before adding to
the cells. Antibodies to the following antigens used in this
study include: ATR, ATM, Chk1, FANCD2 and GAPDH
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Rad18,
from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.; phospho-ATM-Ser1981,
phospho-Chk1 Ser-317 were Cell Signaling Technologies,
γH2AX is from Millipore. The secondary antibodies like
anti-mouse IgG-Cy3, anti-mouse IgG-FITC, anti-rabbit
IgG-FITC were from Molecular Probes.

Immunofluorescence

Clonogenic survival assays

Cells were plated in 6 cm plate and next day treated
with AITC for 16 hours. After drug treatment cells were
exposed to X-rays using a particle linear accelerator,
producing X photons of 10 MV at a dose rate of 0.5 Gy/
min to 6 Gy/min (X-rad Precision X-ray). The irradiator
was at a fixed distance from the target, and the irradiation
field was about 40 X 40 cm. The 6 cm plates were always
placed in the center of the field.

Cells were seeded in to 35 mm glass bottom dishes
(FlouroDish). The resulting cells were treated with AITC
or PITC (or DMSO for controls). Cells were fixed in 3%
formaldehyde for 10 min and then in 100% methanol
(−20°C) for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were
blocked in 10% FBS for 30 min. After three washes with
PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). The slides were
washed three times with PBST containing 1% BSA then
incubated with fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies
for 2 hours at room temperature.

Irradiation

Cells were plated in 6-well dishes in triplicates,
allowed to attach for 16 hours and treated with indicated
concentrations of the therapeutic agents and allowed them
to form colonies by replacing medium every three days.
After 7 to 12 days colonies were fixed in methanol, stained
with crystal violet and the colonies having more than 25
cells were counted using Gene Tools, Syngene Imaging
system [52].

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
After 6 hours and 24 hours of exposure with DMSO,
AITC and PITC, cells were harvested by fixing in ice
cold 70% ethanol and cell cycle profiles were analyzed
by flow cytometry after propidium iodide (PI) staining as
described previously [52].

Cytotoxicity assays
Cells were counted and approximately 300 cells
were seeded in 6 well plates and allowed to attach
overnight. These cells were treated with indicated
concentrations of ITCs and control cells received DMSO.
After three days of incubation cells were trypsinized and
counted using Tryphan blue exclusion assay (Invitrogen).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis assays were performed by treating the
cells with AITC or PITC for 24 hours and 48 hours.
Cells undergoing apoptosis were measured after labeling
with PE-annexin-V apoptosis detection kit (Dead Cell
Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V Alexa Fluor® 488 &
PI according to the manufacturer instruction (Life
technologies Inc.) and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD
Bioscience) [53].

Western blotting
Cells were exposed to the indicated agents and
proteins from whole cell lysates were prepared after
washing the cells with ice cold PBS. Cells were lysed
in ice-cold cytoskeletal (CSK) buffer (10 mM PIPES
(pH 6.8), 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2,
1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM ATP, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF and 0.1% Triton X-100) freshly
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche). After normalizing the protein concentrations,
samples were prepared in 4x SDS-PAGE sample buffer
and heated to 100°C for 15 min. Denatured samples
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred them to
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated
with indicated antibodies followed by respective HRPconjugated secondary antibodies and blots were developed
by chemiluminscense detection kits.

Drug and radiation synergy analysis
AITC and Radiation synergy was determined by
using the combination-index methods and isobologram,
derived from the median effect principle of Chou
and Talalay [28], using the CalcuSyn software 2.1
(Biosoft, UK). Data obtained from the cell survival assays
was used to perform these analyses. The isobologram
method is a graphical demonstration of the pharmacologic
interaction of two drugs, and a desired fractional affected

(Fa). In isobologram straight line connect the Fa points
against experimentally used fixed ratio combinations
of radiation and the AITC on X- and Y-axes to generate
isobolograms. The combination data points that reside
on the line represent an additive interaction while data
points that were below and above the line represent
synergism and antagonism respectively. The combinationindex is a mathematical and quantitative depiction of a
pharmacological interaction of two drugs. A CI = 1
indicative of an additive effect between the two agents,
whereas a CI < 1 indicates, synergism while CI > 1
indicates antagonism.
