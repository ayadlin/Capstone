BACKGROUND: Isolated limb infusion (ILI) is an effective and minimally invasive treatment option for delivering regional chemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma confined to a limb. Recurrent or progressive disease after an ILI, however, presents a challenge for further treatment. The value of repeat ILI in
this situation has not been well documented. METHODS: Forty-eight patients were identified who had
been treated with a repeat ILI. In all patients, a cytotoxic combination of melphalan and actinomycin D was
used. RESULTS: The median time between the 2 procedures was 11 months. The complete response (CR)
rate after repeat ILI was 23%, compared with 31% after the initial ILI (P ¼.36). The overall response was
83%, compared with 75% after the first procedure (P ¼.32). The median duration of response was 11 months
(10 months for patients with CR; P ¼.80), and median survival was 38 months. In those patients achieving a
CR, the median survival was 68 months (P ¼.003). Toxicity after repeat ILI was increased, with 20 patients
experiencing Wieberdink grade III limb toxicity (considerable erythema and edema with blistering) and 5
patients experiencing grade IV toxicity (threatened or actual compartment syndrome), whereas after the
initial ILI these toxicity grades occurred in 14 patients and 1 patient, respectively (P ¼.03). No patient experienced grade V toxicity (requiring amputation). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat ILI is an attractive treatment
option to achieve limb salvage in patients with inoperable recurrent or progressive melanoma after a previous ILI. It can be associated with significant short-term regional toxicity, but is well tolerated by most

In the management of melanoma patients with multiple and/or bulky in-transit metastases confined to a
limb, obtaining local control and preserving the limb can present major challenges. In these patients, isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with melphalan is a suitable treatment option when other local treatments such
as excision, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, or laser ablation are no longer appropriate because of progressive disease.1-3 Although results after ILP are satisfactory, the technique involves a complex and invasive
surgical procedure with a substantial risk of complications.4,5

Repeat ILI for Recurrent Melanoma/Kroon et al

FIGURE 1. This flow diagram illustrates the management of patients with local recurrent melanoma and/or in-transit metastases
of the limb. Solid lines represent management of the present disease. Dotted lines represent management of the possible development of recurrent or progressive disease over time after previous management of the limb disease.

Isolated limb infusion (ILI) has been developed at
the Sydney Melanoma Unit as a simplified and minimally
invasive alternative to ILP.6,7 In essence, ILI is a low-flow
ILP performed via percutaneous catheters without
oxygenation. We have previously shown that the outcomes of ILI are similar to those achieved by conventional
ILP.8
Although ILI often results in a relatively long disease-free survival, recurrent or progressive local disease
after an initial ILI is not uncommon.9 In many patients,
this recurrent disease occurs without any symptomatic
systemic disease.10 In the majority of these locally relapsing patients, the tumor can be controlled again by the
abovementioned, relatively simple local treatment
options. In some patients, however, the recurrences are
too extensive, and in these cases a repeat ILI (or ILP) is the
only realistic treatment option other than amputation.
The minimally invasive character of ILI makes it a potentially attractive procedure to repeat without having to deal

with scar tissue inevitably formed after a previous procedure, in contrast to repeat ILP.
Results of repeat ILP have been reported, but little is
known about the feasibility and efficacy of repeat ILI.11,12
The present study was undertaken to investigate the
response rates and toxicity of repeat ILI in patients with
recurrent limb melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From November 1992 to November 2007, 353 ILI procedures for melanoma were performed in 238 patients at the
Sydney Melanoma Unit (SMU). For this study, we identified 48 patients in whom the ILI procedure was repeated
when disease progression in the limb occurred or new
melanoma metastases developed (Fig. 1). In another 47
patients, the repeat procedure was undertaken as part of a
planned double ILI protocol, with a time interval between
the ILIs of 2 to 8 weeks. The planned double ILI protocol

was investigated as an alternative treatment method to
improve results of the single ILI procedure, and these
patients were not included in this study. The results of the
planned double procedure have been reported earlier.9
The ILI procedures were performed as described
previously.6,7,13 A schematic overview of the procedure is
shown in Figure 2. Briefly, the technical details were as
follows: catheters with additional side-holes near their tips
were inserted percutaneously into the axial artery and vein
of the disease-bearing limb using the Seldinger technique
via the contralateral groin. Their tips were positioned at
the level of the knee or elbow joint. Tissues more proximally located in the limb but distal to the level of the tourniquet were perfused in a retrograde fashion via collateral
vascular channels. The efficiency of this retrograde perfusion via collateral vascular channels is apparent both from
the immediate blanching of the entire limb when the redcell–free drug solution is infused via the arterial catheter,
and from the uniformity of limb skin erythema  edema
in the postoperative period. If not affected by the disease,
an Esmarch bandage was applied to the foot or hand,
excluding it from the effects of the cytotoxic agents. A
pneumatic tourniquet was inflated around the root of the
limb, and the cytotoxic agents were infused into the isolated circuit via the arterial catheter. The cytotoxic drugs
that were used in all cases were melphalan (5-10 mg/L of
tissue) and actinomycin D (50-100 lg/L of tissue) in 400
mL warmed, heparinized normal saline. Actinomycin D
was used as well as melphalan because of the satisfactory
response rates of this combination when administered by
conventional ILP in our institution, without excessive
toxicity.2
1934

For the duration of the ILI procedure (20-30
minutes), the infusate was continually circulated by
repeated aspiration from the venous catheter and reinjection into the arterial catheter using a syringe attached to a
3-way tap in the external circuit. To increase the limb
temperatures, a blood-warming coil was incorporated in
the extracorporeal circuit, and the limb was encased by a
hot-air blanket, with an overhead radiant heater placed
over it.
Subcutaneous and intramuscular temperature
probes continuously monitored the limb temperatures
during the ILI procedure. Blood samples were taken every
5 minutes both from the systemic circulation and from
the isolated circuit to assess the drug leakage rate from the
limb to the systemic circulation and to measure melphalan
concentrations and blood gases. The limb was flushed
with 1 L of Hartmann solution via the arterial catheter after the infusion period, and the venous effluent was discarded. The limb tourniquet was then deflated to restore
normal limb circulation, and the catheters were removed.
For patients with metastatic disease in the groin or axilla
requiring a regional lymph node dissection as well as an
ILI, this was undertaken under the same anesthetic after
completion of the ILI procedure, removal of the catheters,
and reversal of the heparin.
Postoperatively limb toxicity (recorded using the
scale proposed by Wieberdink et al. [Table 1])14 and systemic toxicity were assessed daily along with measurements of the serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) level.
CK levels exceeding 1000 IU/L can be associated with serious toxicity. Therefore all patients whose CK levels
exceeded this level or who developed Wieberdink grade
III toxicity or higher were treated with systemic corticosteroids until their CK level had fallen to <1000 IU/L or the
signs of limb toxicity had diminished.15 Tumor response

was assessed regularly during the patient’s hospital stay,
and every 4 weeks after discharge, for at least 3 months.
According to the standard World Health Organization
criteria, a complete response (CR) was recorded when all
measurable disease had disappeared, based on observations made on 2 separate occasions not <4 weeks apart. A
partial response (PR) required a 50% decrease in total
tumor size determined by 2 observations not <4 weeks
apart and no appearance of new lesions or progression of
any lesion.16 It was possible to evaluate the responses of all
48 patients included in this study. Follow-up of 3 (6%)
patients at the SMU after both their first and repeat ILIs
was not possible, because they lived in a remote region or
overseas. In these circumstances, the general practitioner
or referring surgeon was consulted. All data were collected
prospectively and recorded on a computerized database.
The data were tested for statistically significant differences between the initial and repeat procedure. The
chi-square test was used for comparison of frequency distributions, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for
nonparametric variables.17 Continuous variables were
assessed using analysis of variance for repeated measures.

The patient characteristics are listed in Table 2. There
were 26 men (54%) and 22 women (46%) in the study.
The average age at the time of the first ILI was 72 years,
and the age at the time of the repeat ILI was 74 years
(range, 46-94 years), with a median of 11 months between
the initial and repeat procedures. At the time of the repeat
treatment, significantly more patients had M. D. Anderson stage IV disease (Table 3)19 compared with the first
ILI (P ¼ .04). These patients suffered from concurrent intransit metastases and newly diagnosed distant metastases
outside the treated limb at the time of their repeat ILI; this
caused the documented increase in their stage of disease.
The other patient-related factor that changed significantly
was the depth of tumor infiltration, with an increased
number of patients having both cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor metastases at the time of the repeat ILI (25 vs
15 patients; P ¼ .01). All other patient and tumor characteristics remained equally distributed at the time of the
repeat ILI.
Response Rates, Duration of Response,

The median patient follow-up after repeat ILI was 18
months. After the repeat treatment, the CR rate was 23%.

This compares with a response rate of 31% after the first

(P ¼ .36) (Table 4). The overall response (OR) rate was
slightly increased after repeat ILI (83%) compared with
the OR rate after the first ILI (75%), but again this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .32).
The median duration of OR after repeat ILI was 11

which was significantly longer than the median OR duration of 6 months after the first ILI (IQR, 5 to >13

Intraoperative Variables and Toxicity
Intraoperative variables and toxicity data after the ILI procedures are listed in Table 5. During the repeat procedure,
somewhat higher doses of melphalan were infused
(median, 7.7 mg/L; IQR 7.1-8.3 mg/L) compared with
the first ILI (median, 7.1 mg/L; IQR, 6.1-7.8 mg/L;
P ¼ .02). Consequently, the melphalan concentration in
the infusate was also higher during the repeat ILI (median,
412 lM; IQR, 303-473 lM) than during the first treatment (median, 298 lM; IQR, 249-377 lM;
P ¼ <.0001).

An Esmarch bandage was not used in 6 repeat ILI
cases, whereas it was not used in only 1 patient during the
first ILI treatment (P ¼ .11).
Limb toxicity after repeat ILI was significantly
increased compared with the first treatment, with 1
patient developing Wieberdink grade I, 22 patients developing grade II, 20 patients developing grade III, and 5
patients experiencing grade IV toxicity. After the initial
ILI, this was as follows: 1 patient developed grade I, 32
patients grade II, 14 patients grade III, and 1 patient grade
IV toxicity (P ¼ .03). Although most patients experienced
the same or an increase in limb toxicity after repeat ILI,
lower limb toxicity was also seen after repeat ILI. No
patient experienced grade V toxicity. Three patients with
grade IV toxicity after repeat ILI had a fasciotomy in the
postoperative period. No patient had a fasciotomy after
the first ILI (P ¼ .24). The patient experiencing grade IV
toxicity after the first procedure developed grade II toxicity after the repeat ILI. Those who experienced grade IV
toxicity after the repeat ILI had developed grade II (n ¼ 2)
and grade III (n ¼ 3) toxicity after the first ILI. After
repeat ILI, 1 patient experienced an allergic reaction to
the melphalan, and 1 patient developed a pancytopenia
postoperatively. No complications were seen after the first
treatment.

The postoperative serum CK values were significantly greater after the repeat procedure (median, 1123
IU/L; IQR, 405-3353 IU/L) compared with the CK values after the first ILI (median, 318 IU/L; IQR, 134-1032
IU/L; P ¼ .002). The postoperative day on which the serum CK level peaked was the same after both treatments
(median, postoperative day 4; range, day 1-11).
The occurrence of systemic drug leakage was equally
distributed between the 2 groups and occurred in 3
patients during the first ILI and in 4 patients during the
repeat treatment (P ¼ .90). In all 7 patients, the systemic
leakage was <1% of the total administered melphalan
dose. Postoperative nausea and vomiting15 was mild in all
patients and not significantly different after initial and
repeat procedures (P ¼ .24).
When treated with a repeat ILI, patients remained
in hospital 1 day longer (median, 8 days; IQR, 7-10 days)
than they did after the first treatment (median, 7 days;
IQR, 6-9 days). This difference was statistically significant
(P ¼ .008).

DISCUSSION
Recurrent or progressive limb melanoma after an ILI
presents a therapeutic dilemma, and treatment options
1937

Original Article

depend on the extent of the disease and the symptoms
that it is causing. In the majority of cases, the local cutaneous or superficial subcutaneous recurrences are small
enough to be managed by surgical excision or by other
simple local treatment options such as cryotherapy, laser
ablation, or electrodesiccation.20,21 However, when there
are large or numerous cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions,
these local treatments are insufficient, and repeat ILP or
ILI may be the only alternatives to amputation.
In this study, we found that repeat ILI results in satisfactory response rates, with an OR rate that is comparable to the OR rate we found in a large series of patients
treated by a single ILI.8 However, the CR rate of 23%
after repeat ILI was lower than the CR rate of 38% in our
single ILI study. This difference may be explained by the
higher stage of disease of the patients who underwent
repeat ILI. As we have shown previously, higher stage of
disease is an important factor predicting a lower probability of response. This indicates that tumors with the
capacity to spread more aggressively locally and/or metastasize to distant sites are less likely to respond well to
regional chemotherapy.8
Although not achieving a CR, symptoms were
relieved in most patients achieving a PR, with a better
limb function and a markedly improved quality of life,
which were judged to have made the procedure worthwhile to undertake. In view with this, the OR rate of 83%
that was achieved after repeat ILI could be regarded as
satisfactory.
In studies describing results after repeat ILP, similar
OR rates were recorded, ranging from 71% to 96%, but
also higher CR rates, ranging from 65% to 83%.11,12,22,23
Patient selection may possibly explain this difference in
CR rates, because the patients in our study had more
advanced stages of disease compared with those in the ILP
studies. Also, the addition of tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a to melphalan in several of the repeat ILP studies
may have had an advantageous effect on response,11,12,24
because it has been suggested that TNF-a is particularly
effective in higher stages of disease, when there are more
bulky and well-vascularized lesions.23,25 Finally, patient
numbers in the reported ILP studies were generally low
(6-25 patients), making results possibly less reliable. In
the current series, 3 patients were not followed up at the
SMU, because they lived in a remote region or overseas.
However, response and duration of response were assessed
1938

by the referring surgeon and/or general practitioner after
both the first and the repeat ILI, making the likelihood of
introducing bias very small.
In the past, some studies have investigated the use of
other cytotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin and fotemustine,
to treat recurrent or persistent melanoma after a previous
ILI or ILP.26-28 Results of these studies showed no
improvement compared with melphalan-based procedures, and the toxicity and morbidity of these alternative
cytotoxic regimens were unacceptably high.
Toxicity after ILI and ILP has been shown to be
similar.29 After repeat ILI, grade III or IV toxicity
occurred significantly more frequently when compared
with the first ILI. The toxicity reported after repeat ILP
varies, with 1 study reporting increased toxicity,22 but
not others.11,12,23 The increased toxicity after repeat ILI
seen in the present series appears to have been directly
related to the increased melphalan dosage used in these
procedures. In previous studies, we have shown that a
higher melphalan concentration is a significant predictor
not only of increased toxicity, but also for increased
response.8,30 In view of these results, the treating surgeon
may have tended to increase the drug dose slightly for
repeat ILI in the hope of attaining an optimal result in
this difficult-to-treat patient group. It has been suggested
that severe acute limb toxicity after ILP correlates significantly with a higher risk of long-term morbidity, but this
has not been observed in patients treated by ILI at the
SMU.3,9,30
In the current study, the median duration of
response after repeat ILI was 11 months, with a median
overall survival of 38 months. The increased survival
observed after a CR after repeat ILI was most likely a
reflection of the tumor biology.8,31 The recurrent locoregional disease in these patients is less aggressive and has a
lower tendency to develop distant metastases than the disease of patients who do not experience a CR.30,32 The
durations of response and survival times after repeat ILI
are similar to those obtained after repeat ILP, which has a
reported duration of response of 6 to 14 months and survival ranging from 33 to 54 months.11,12,22,23
The advantage of ILI compared with other local
treatments is that the whole area at risk of recurrence is
treated, with the possibility of eradicating microscopic
disease that may be present in the affected limb.33,34 The
increased median duration of response after ILI and ILP
Cancer

compared with excision alone seems likely to be the result
of this additional effect on microscopic disease.
Because conventional ILP involves open surgical exposure of major vessels, it is a considerably more difficult
and time-consuming procedure when the procedure needs
to be repeated, because of scar tissue that has formed as a
result of the earlier ILP. Also, the risk of complications is
increased, and this may discourage surgeons from repeating the procedure.1,35 These technical difficulties are
avoided with repeat ILI, because the catheters used in ILI
are introduced percutaneously without open surgical
access to the vessels.
In conclusion, results after repeat ILI are generally
satisfactory, with acceptable toxicity. Because survival
times for patients with recurrent or progressive disease
after a previous ILI are considerable, every attempt should
be made to avoid amputation. In patients with extensive
recurrent disease in a limb, repeat ILI is an attractive treatment option because of its simplicity and minimally invasive character.
