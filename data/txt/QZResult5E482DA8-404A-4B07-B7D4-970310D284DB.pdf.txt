Coordinate PI3K pathway and Bcl-2 family disruption in AML
Prithviraj Bose, Mohamed Rahmani, and Steven Grant
The B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family of pro- and
anti-apoptotic proteins controls the mitochondrial pathway
of apoptosis. Their central role in mediating the final
common pathway of apoptosis in response to internal and
external stressors makes them attractive therapeutic targets
in neoplastic cells, which are often “primed” for apoptosis.
The major anti-apoptotic proteins are Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and
myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). These promote cellular
survival by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins which
function as apoptosis “sensitizers” (e.g., Bim, Bad) or
“effectors” (Bax, Bak). Multiple studies have implicated
Bcl-2 family proteins in AML pathogenesis, prognosis and
resistance to chemotherapy.
The discovery of the “BH3-mimetic” ABT-737, a
specific inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic actions of Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL, demonstrated for the first time that specific
protein-protein interactions could be disrupted using a
small molecule [1]. Several groups [2, 3] have shown that
Mcl-1, which is not inhibited by ABT-737, is the primary
determinant of resistance to this agent. This, along with
recent evidence that Mcl-1 may be more critical to the
development and maintenance of AML than Bcl-2 or
Bcl-xL [4], has prompted interest in combining agents
that down-regulate Mcl-1 with ABT-737 in AML to
simultaneously disable multiple arms of the mitochondrial
apoptotic regulatory machinery. Thus, cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors [3] and sorafenib [5] synergize with
ABT-737 in pre-clinical studies of AML.
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is one
of the most frequently dysregulated survival pathways
in human malignancies, including AML, leading to its
emergence as a therapeutic target in this disease [6]. For
example, internal tandem duplication mutations in the
FLT3 gene, affecting approximately 25% of patients with
AML, lead to constitutive FLT3 signaling which activates
Akt and confers a poor prognosis. Similarly, Ras and KIT
mutations, common in core-binding factor AML, activate
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In many cases, the basis
for addiction to this pathway, manifested by basal Akt
activation, remains unknown. While mTOR inhibitors are
approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma and the PI3K
delta inhibitor GS-1101 (CAL-101) appears promising
in CLL, a new class of agents that inhibit both PI3K and
mTOR signaling (e.g., NVP-BEZ235, GDC0980) may
offer additional therapeutic advantages in AML [7].
In light of the above considerations, and the known
ability of PI3K inhibitors to down-regulate Mcl-1 and

up-regulate/activate the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim,
Bad, Bax and Bak, the effects of dual PI3K/mTOR
and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition in AML cell lines, patientderived leukemic blasts, and xenograft models of AML
were recently examined [8]. Notably, tet-inducible short
hairpin RNA constructs directed against Akt or Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL individually or together, and studies employing
pharmacologic inhibitors (e.g., NVP-BEZ235/PI-103 and
ABT-737), revealed that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL play important coordinate roles in
protecting leukemia cells from lethality. Specifically,
genetic or pharmacologic interventions simultaneously
inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and disabling
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL dramatically enhanced leukemic cell death,
with minimal toxicity toward normal CD34+ hematopoietic
progenitors. These findings were recapitulated in vivo
in an AML xenograft model with little toxicity, likely
reflecting both a dependence of leukemic cells on the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway for survival, and relative
sparing of normal cells by BH3-mimetic treatment. Mcl1 down-regulation resulted from PI3K/mTOR inhibition,
at least in part through GSK3 activation, which promotes
the proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. Although BEZ235
alone down-regulated Mcl-1, it did not significantly trigger
cell death, underscoring the importance of concomitant
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition, as all three major anti-apoptotic
proteins sequester the apoptosis effectors Bax and Bak.
Significantly, release of Bax and Bak from Mcl-1, Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL was observed.
Another novel finding was a marked increase
in Bim binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL accompanying
PI3K/mTOR inhibition, a phenomenon abolished by
ABT-737. Presumably Bim, liberated from these two
anti-apoptotic proteins, as well as Mcl-1 (due to downregulation), triggered apoptosis by activating Bax and
Bak. A summary of these interactions is presented in
Figure 1. A particularly intriguing observation was an
apparent correlation between responses to combined
treatment with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and ABT-737 and
baseline Akt activation in primary AML blasts, raising the
possibility that such cells may be addicted to this pathway
and particularly vulnerable to its interruption. In fact, it
is conceivable that assessment of Akt pathway activation
may be a more reliable predictor of susceptibility to a dual
PI3K/mTOR blockade and BH3-mimetic strategy than
mutations in related proteins. Clearly, definitive answers to
this question will require analysis of a considerably larger
number of specimens. In any case, a major thrust of recent

inhibitors downregulate Mcl-1, at least in part through a GSK3-dependent mechanism, leading to the release of Bax, Bak and Bim, and
a significant increase in liberated Bim binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The latter phenomenon is completely abrogated by ABT-737, which
concomitantly triggers the release of Bax and Bak from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Thus, combined treatment leads to the release of all major
proapoptotic Bcl-2 members (Bim, Bak and Bax), culminating in apoptosis induction. Finally, activation of GSK3 by Akt inhibition may
also promote apoptosis through yet to be defined mechanisms.

therapeutic approaches to AML has been to tailor drug
therapy to specific genetic mutations, e.g., those in FLT3
or KIT. However, the success of this approach is uncertain
due to the upstream location of these mutated oncoproteins
and the marked redundancy of signal transduction
pathways. Pending more definitive validation, the present
findings suggest novel candidate biomarkers (e.g., basal
pathway activation) that might better help realize the goal
of personalized therapy for AML.
