Abstract
Base excision repair (BER) plays a critical role in the repair of bases damaged by oxidative metabolism or
alkylating agents, such as those commonly used in cancer therapy. Incomplete BER generates intermediates
that require activation of homology-dependent DNA repair to resolve. We investigated the effects of lithocholic
acid (LCA), an inhibitor of the key BER enzyme DNA polymerase β (pol β), in cells deficient in expression of
the homology-dependent repair factor BRCA2. In vitro studies show that LCA suppresses the DNA polymerase
and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activities of DNA pol β by preventing the formation of a stable pol β–DNA
complex, reducing BER effectiveness. Cytotoxicity assays based on colony formation revealed that LCA exhibits synergism with the alkylating agent temozolomide, which engages BER through DNA methylation, and
that the degree of synergism is increased in cells lacking functional BRCA2. BRCA2-deficient cells also showed
heightened susceptibility to both LCA and temozolomide individually. The potentiation of temozolomide cytotoxicity by LCA owes to the conversion of single-stranded DNA breaks generated through incomplete BER of
methylated nucleotides into double-stranded breaks during DNA replication, as indicated by γH2AX immunofluorescence. Death seems to be induced in cotreated cells through an accumulation of persistent doublestranded DNA breaks. Mutations of the BRCA2 gene have been extensively characterized and are present in
various cancers, implying that inhibition of BER may offer a means to augment tumor selectivity in the use of
conventional cancer therapies. Cancer Res; 70(1); 409–17. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid, has previously been identified as a potent inhibitor of mammalian DNA
polymerase β (pol β; ref. 1). In the absence of pol β, the base
excision repair (BER) pathway is defective (2). BER is essential to the maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly
with respect to oxidative damage and alkylation-induced
lesions (3, 4). Pol β has also been shown to catalyze the removal of a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (5′-dRP) group during
short-patch (single-nucleotide gap) BER when base damage
is recognized by a monofunctional DNA glycosylase (5). Inhibition of either the DNA polymerase or 5′-dRP lyase functionalities of pol β can therefore result in termination of
short-patch BER.
The oral alkylating agent temozolomide has been extensively studied in the treatment of various tumors, including
glioblastoma multiforme, metastatic melanoma, and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (6–10). The antineoplastic efficaAuthors' Affiliation: Departments of Therapeutic Radiology and

cy of temozolomide is dependent on its ability to methylate
DNA, primarily at the targets O6-guanine, N7-guanine, and
N3-adenine (11). Recent work has shown that inhibition of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity potentiates
the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide (12, 13). As the PARP
family member PARP-1 functions to detect single-stranded
DNA breaks (SSB) and is required for recruitment of proteins
to promote efficient BER (14, 15), the observed potentiation
is presumably attributable to an inability to complete BER of
deleterious methyl adducts.
Our goal was to determine whether disruption of the BER
pathway through the inhibitory effect of LCA on pol β would
produce a similar sensitivity to temozolomide-induced DNA
methylation. We further hypothesized that synergism of LCA
with temozolomide would be increased in cell lines lacking
the ability to efficiently repair double-stranded DNA breaks
(DSB), owing to inactivation of the homology-dependent
DNA repair (HDR) pathway. HDR uses homologous regions
of DNA to repair DSBs and is typically considered to be an
error-free pathway, in contrast to more error-prone pathways
such as nonhomologous end joining (16). HDR resolves collapsed replication forks that may arise from SSBs, such as those
resulting from failed BER. To this end, we explored the individual and combined effects of LCA and temozolomide in cell
lines deficient in expression of the critical HDR factor, BRCA2.

homologous recombination (17–19). BRCA2 interacts directly
with RAD51 and facilitates the formation of helical RAD51ssDNA filaments, which localize to template DNA to initiate
repair (20, 21). Hereditary germ-line mutations in the BRCA2
gene contribute a significant predisposition to breast and
ovarian cancers, arising from increased genetic instability
and subsequent cellular transformation as a result of inefficient HDR (22–24). Additionally, BRCA2 silencing and mutational inactivation can contribute to sporadic tumorigenesis
(25, 26). Thus, BRCA2-deficient cancers represent an attractive target for synergistic drug therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. VC-8 (BRCA2-deficient) and VC-8+BRCA2–
complemented Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were a
gift of Dr. Graeme C.M. Smith (KuDOS Pharmaceuticals
Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) and were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). EUFA423 (BRCA2-deficient) and EUFA423+BRCA2–
complemented human fibroblasts were a gift of Dr. Simon
Powell (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,
NY) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, 20 mmol/L HEPES, and 500 mg/mL G418 (complemented
only). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines 92TAg
[wild-type (WT)] and 308TAg (Aag−/−) were a gift of Dr. Leona
Samson (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,
MA) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and L-glutamine. All cells were cultured at 37°C in a
5% CO2 atmosphere.
Transfection, infection, and expression analysis. To infect the MEFs, the WT pol β and E295K constructs were
packaged into retroviruses using the GP2-293 viral packaging
cell line. Exponentially growing MEFs at ∼50% confluence in
60-mm dishes were incubated with 1 mL of virus with 1 μg/mL
polybrene (Sigma) for 2 h. The medium was then removed and
replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μg/mL polybrene.
After an overnight incubation, cells were split into 100-mm
dishes at different cell densities. All dishes were incubated
overnight and then supplemented with 400 μg/mL hygromycin B (Invitrogen) to select clones with stably integrated constructs. Tetracycline (Sigma) at a concentration of 4 μg/mL
was also present in the medium to repress expression of
the WT or E295K proteins. Individual cell colonies were
cloned using cloning cylinders and expanded in the same
growth medium.
Chemicals. LCA and temozolomide were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Stocks (100 mmol/L) in DMSO were prepared
fresh before each experiment, diluted as necessary, and
added to culture medium at 0.1% (v/v). All culture medium
was limited to 5% FBS during drug treatment to inhibit LCA
precipitation. Ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, ATP,
and [γ-32P]ATP (>6,000 Ci/mmol, 150 mCi/mL) and cordycepin
5′-triphosphate [α-32P]dATP (>5,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased
from New England Biolabs, Sigma, and Perkin-Elmer, respectively. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG; M0280S), human AP endonuclease I (APE1; M0282S), terminal transferase (M0252S), T4
polynucleotide kinase (M0201S), and T4 DNA ligase (M0202S)

were purchased from New England Biolabs. Sodium borohydride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Preparation of DNA substrates. Oligonucleotides were
synthesized by the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University.
The substrates used were 45AG (GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCA A C_ CA A C CT CG A T C C AA T G C C GT CC ) an d L PS D
(CTGCAGCTGATGCGCUGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC). The
primer oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′-end with T4
polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Other oligonucleotides were 5′-end phosphorylated with the kinase and cold
ATP. After purification on a Bio-Rad spin column to remove
unincorporated deoxynucleotide triphosphates, annealing
was performed by mixing phosphorylated template, radiolabeled primer, and phosphorylated downstream oligos in 50
mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.25 mol/L NaCl. The
mixture was incubated sequentially at 95°C (5 min), slowly
cooled to 50°C (for 30 min) and 50°C (for 20 min), and immediately transferred to ice. To verify proper hybridization, the
product was analyzed on an 18% native polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography to assess the quality of annealing.
In vitro primer extension assay. Primer extension experiments were conducted in a solution containing 50 mmol/L TrisHCl buffer (pH 8.0), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, 20 mmol/
L NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 25 μmol/L dTTP. Enzyme/1-bp–
gapped DNA mix (10 nmol/L/5 nmol/L) was incubated first
with various concentrations of LCA (0–100 μmol/L) and
DMSO as control. The enzyme-DNA mixes were incubated
with dTTP-MgCl2 and reactions were carried out at 37°C for
20 min, after which they were stopped by addition of an equal
volume of 90% formamide dye and 0.3 mol/L EDTA. Samples
were resolved by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide
gels containing 8 mol/L urea and then visualized and quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).
Preparation of 5′-dRP substrate. The 3′-end of DNA substrate LPSD, which contained a single U at position 19 from
3′-end, was radiolabeled using [α-32P]ATP and terminal
transferase and annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide. This DNA duplex was treated with UDG (2 units/1 pmol
DNA) in 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5) at 37°C for 10 min followed
by treatment with human APE1 (2 units/1 pmol DNA) in buffer
R (10 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 mmol/L KCl, and 2 mmol/L DTT) at
37°C for 15 min, which incises the phosphodiester backbone
on the 5′-side of the AP site and leaves a 3′-OH and a 5′-dRP
residue. Due to the labile nature of the AP site, the 5′-dRP–
containing DNA substrate was prepared just before use.
5′-dRP lyase assay. The assay was set up according to
Haracska and colleagues (27) with minor modifications. Typically, reaction mixtures (30 μL) contained the DNA polymerases (10 nmol/L) and the 5′-dRP–containing DNA
substrate (5 nmol/L) in buffer R [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.5), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 mmol/L KCl, and 2 mmol/L DTT].
Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Various concentrations of LCA (0–100 μmol/L) were added to a standard dRP
lyase assay. The reaction product was stabilized by the addition of 2 mol/L sodium borohydride to a final concentration of
340 mmol/L followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Stabilized (reduced) DNA products were ethanol precipitated in the

presence of 0.1 μg/mL tRNA and resuspended in water and an
equal volume of formamide dye was added. These products
were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and visualized
with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager.
BER assay. 5′-End–labeled LPSD substrate was used as a
BER substrate. For reconstituted BER with purified proteins,
we followed the method as described by Haracska and colleagues (27) with some minor modifications. Typically, 100
nmol/L UDG–treated substrate was first incubated for 15
min with commercially available APE1. Approximately 5
nmol/L APE–treated substrate was incubated with purified
10 nmol/L pol β in BER buffer [45 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.8), 70 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L DTT, 7.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L ATP, and 20 μmol/L each of
dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP] and T4 DNA ligase with an
increasing concentration of LCA (0–100 μmol/L) for 15 min
at 37°C. Finally, EDTA containing formamide dye was added
to stop the reaction. The repaired product was resolved on a
20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by visualization
on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager.
Gel mobility shift assay. Various concentrations of WT
pol β protein (0.1–1,000 nmol/L) and 150 μmol/L LCA were
incubated with 0.1 nmol/L radiolabeled gapped DNA substrate in buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
100 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10% glycerol at
room temperature (23°C) for 15 min. Samples were loaded
onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel with the current running
at 300 V at 4°C. After the sample was loaded, the voltage was
reduced to 150 V. Bound protein was quantified using ImageQuant software after scanning the gel using a Storm 860
PhosphorImager. Protein bound to DNA resulted in a shift
of the DNA on the gel when compared with DNA without
bound protein. Fraction bound is the ratio of the intensity
of all shifted species divided by the total. The dissociation
constant for DNA (KD) was estimated from fitting the bound
protein (Y) versus protein concentration (x) with the following equation: Y = [(mx)/(x + KD)] + b, where m is a scaling
factor and b is the apparent minimum Y value.
Immunofluorescence. VC-8 and VC-8+BRCA2–complemented cells were seeded onto UV-irradiated coverslips
(Corning) and allowed to adhere for 24 h and then cotreated
with LCA and temozolomide for 3 h. Cells were either prepared immediately or following a 24-h recovery in untreated
medium to allow DSB repair. Procedures were performed
under reduced light and all washes used 1× PBS. The culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed once
and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and then washed again. Cells were blocked with
0.5% Triton X-100 buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min at room temperature and then
incubated with the following antibodies in PBS containing 3% BSA for 20 min at 37°C, with multiple washes after
each step: rabbit anti-γH2AX antibody (1:500; Bethyl Laboratories) and FITC-conjugated F(ab′) 2 fragment donkey
anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Cells were then stained with 100 ng/mL 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) for 1 min at room temperature and washed, and the coverslips were mounted on

microscope slides using a 90% glycerol/10% PBS solution
containing 0.01% p-phenylenediamine. Images were captured using an Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.).
Clonogenic survival assays. All cell lines were plated in
triplicate at 500 to 1,000 per well in six-well plates to provide
an optimal counting density. Cells were treated with temozolomide for 24 h and with LCA for the entirety of the assay.
Cells were cultured for 1 to 2 wk until well-defined colonies
had formed, replacing culture medium every 2 to 3 d. Cells
were briefly permeabilized with 0.9% saline solution and
stained with crystal violet in 80% methanol. Colonies of
≥50 cells were then counted visually. Data points represent
the average of the three values and error bars represent
the SD.

Results
LCA reduces BER activity via inhibition of pol β. LCA
has been previously shown to inhibit the polymerase activity
of pol β. We verified that LCA inhibits pol β–catalyzed DNA
polymerization in a dose-dependent manner by assaying the
repair of 45AG DNA substrate, which contains a 1-nucleotide
gap. Polymerase activity was almost completely absent at an
LCA concentration of ≥60 μmol/L (Fig. 1A). We further
showed that LCA inhibits 5′-dRP lyase catalysis by pol β using a prototypical lyase assay (Fig. 1B). A mixture of pol β
and 5′-dRP substrate was allowed to react in the presence
of increasing concentrations of LCA. In the presence of
60 μmol/L LCA, product formation was reduced to 30% of baseline levels, indicating a similar dose response as for polymerase
activity (Fig. 1B).
To assess whether this inhibition could be directly attributed to the inability of pol β to form a stable complex with
DNA in the presence of LCA, the binding of pol β to a DNA
substrate containing a 1-nucleotide gap was assayed (Fig. 1C
and D). The DNA dissociation constant (KD DNA) of WT pol
β has been previously established to be 12 ± 2 nmol/L (28). In
the presence of DMSO vehicle alone, the KD DNA increases to
78 ± 14 nmol/L. At 150 μmol/L LCA, the binding of pol β to
DNA was dramatically reduced, and the KD DNA of pol β
could not be determined, suggesting that no stable proteinDNA interaction is occurring.
We hypothesized that the inhibitory action of LCA on both
the polymerase and 5′-dRP lyase functionalities of pol β represented an effective mechanism to inhibit the BER pathway. To
determine the degree to which BER could be reduced by LCA,
the repair of a DNA substrate containing a 1-nucleotide gap
was assayed in the presence of pol β, apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease, and T4 DNA ligase (Fig. 2A). The lower bands
on the gel represent the starting DNA substrate before (n)
and after (n+1) polymerization by pol β, whereas the highest
band represents the completely repaired DNA product. The levels of each are represented by the band intensity. Complete
BER of the substrate was reduced by 37.2% on the addition of
60 μmol/L LCA relative to DMSO control (Fig. 2B).
LCA and temozolomide synergism is increased in
BRCA2-deficient cells. The HDR pathway is the primary

cellular mechanism for error-free repair of DSBs and collapsed replication forks. We wished to determine whether
inhibition of BER by LCA, with or without engagement of
BER by the alkylating agent temozolomide, would result
in increased toxicity in HDR-deficient cells compared with
HDR-proficient cells. We reasoned that blocking BER would
yield strand-break intermediates that required HDR for resolution. We therefore treated human and CHO cell lines deficient in BRCA2 with increasing concentrations of LCA
and/or temozolomide in clonogenic assays. Cells were treated with temozolomide for 24 hours or with LCA for the
duration of the assay.
In the BRCA2-deficient VC-8 CHO and EUFA423 human
fibroblast cell lines, both LCA and temozolomide individually
exhibited increased cytotoxicity over the entire dose range
relative to paired cell lines complemented with WT BRCA2
(Fig. 3A and B, respectively). Differences between the deficient and complemented lines were analyzed statistically
via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and were significant at
the P < 0.001 level for LCA and temozolomide treatment in
VC-8 and temozolomide treatment in EUFA423 and at the

P < 0.005 level for LCA treatment in EUFA423. The data thus
imply that the frequency of endogenous DNA lesions leads to
sufficiently high levels of SSBs in the presence of LCA to yield
lower cell survival when these breaks are converted to DSBs
and remain unrepaired by HDR. Similarly, the potency of temozolomide as an alkylating agent allows for sufficient quantities of methyl adducts to be generated and lead to
unrepaired DNA lesions even in the presence of a functional
BER pathway, conferring an increased sensitivity in BRCA2deficient cell lines.
Having established BRCA2-deficient cell lines as susceptible to both LCA and temozolomide individually, we hypothesized that the two agents would exhibit a synergistic effect
by creating an inability to complete the repair of any methyl
adducts formed. Stalling and subsequent collapse of replication forks as cells containing unrepaired SSBs (owing to ineffective BER) progressed into S phase and began to undergo
DNA replication would provide an increased frequency of
DSBs. Cells were treated with temozolomide for 24 hours or
LCA for the duration of the assay or both, and clonogenic survival was measured. Synergism was assessed mathematically

using the Chou-Talalay mutually nonexclusive model (29).
When data are fit using this method, combination index
(CI) values <1, 1, and >1 are indicative of synergism, additive
effect, and antagonism, respectively. At 10 μmol/L temozolomide
and 60 μmol/L LCA, VC-8 and VC-8+BRCA2 cells yielded CI
values of 0.43 and 0.79, respectively (Fig. 3B). At 20 μmol/L
temozolomide and 80 μmol/L LCA, EUFA423 and EUFA423
+BRCA2 yielded CI values of 0.58 and 0.71, respectively (Fig. 3D).
The model thus indicates synergism between LCA and temozolomide in each cell line examined and suggests that the
synergism was greater in BRCA2-deficient cells relative to
BRCA2-complemented cells in both sets of paired lines.
Additional cell lines deficient in the HDR factors FANCA
(PD220) and BRCA1 (UWB1.289) were also investigated and
were weakly sensitive to temozolomide individually but
showed no significant increase in LCA/temozolomide synergism relative to cell lines complemented with the respective
HDR proteins (data not shown).
The in vivo effectiveness of LCA is specifically related to
pol β inhibition. To assess whether the synergism of LCA

mutant of pol β, which has previously been shown to render
cells deficient in BER (30).
We treated the two cell lines with temozolomide in the
presence of either 50 μmol/L LCA or DMSO vehicle alone
and observed the response in a clonogenic survival assay.
In the cells expressing WT pol β, there was a significant difference in survival at the P < 0.05 level depending on the
treatment or not with LCA (Fig. 4A). However, in the cells
also expressing the E295K dominant-negative mutant pol
β, no significant difference was observed between LCA- or
DMSO-treated cells, indicating that the effect of LCA is eliminated when the BER capacity of pol β is already inhibited by
the dominant-negative pol β variant. Approximately 80% of
the lesions induced by temozolomide are N-methylated purines (31). Alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) is the primary
DNA glycosylase responsible for recognizing temozolomideinduced DNA lesions, and its knockout serves to mitigate temozolomide cytotoxicity by preventing the creation of abasic
sites. In an AAG-null background (308 cells), the overall levels
of survival are higher compared with the AAG-WT cells for
each experimental condition (Fig. 4B). This is as expected,
because, in the absence of AAG, the production of abasic
sites as an initial step in BER is substantially reduced, and
so survival is improved (although such cells will likely have
increased mutation rates). However, as with the AAG-WT
cells, in the AAG-null cells expressing WT pol β, there is still
an effect of LCA on survival to temozolomide. In contrast,
in the cells expressing the dominant-negative pol β, there is
no effect of LCA, again showing that the potentiation of temozolomide cytotoxicity by LCA depends specifically on a
functional pol β. These data strongly indicate that pol β
inhibition is the underlying mechanism for potentiation
of temozolomide by LCA rather than an effect on another
polymerase or other cellular target.
LCA and temozolomide cotreatment produces persistent
DSBs in the absence of BRCA2. Immunofluorescence analysis of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) foci formation
was used to measure DSB accumulation in LCA- and temozolomide-treated VC-8 (BRCA2-deficient) and VC-8+BRCA2–
complemented cells (Fig. 5A). The cells were treated for 3
hours and were analyzed either immediately or following a
24-hour recovery period to facilitate DNA repair and allow
all cells to enter S phase. Relatively low frequencies of γH2AX
foci were observable immediately following treatment and
occurred at similar levels in both cell lines (Fig. 5B). Treatment with DMSO vehicle or 20 μmol/L LCA induced fewer
γH2AX foci than treatment with 20 μmol/L temozolomide
or 20 μmol/L LCA + 20 μmol/L temozolomide.
Following the 24-hour recovery period, continued DSB
generation and persistence was markedly higher in VC-8 than
in VC-8+BRCA2. When treated with temozolomide alone, foci
levels in VC-8+BRCA2 cells fell by 33% after 24 hours, whereas foci levels in VC-8 cells rose by 157%. Under combined
LCA and temozolomide treatment, foci levels in VC-8
+BRCA2 cells fell by 48% and foci levels in VC-8 cells rose
by 280%. The data agree with our prediction that in the absence of HDR, DSBs produced by LCA and/or temozolomide
treatment remain unrepaired and the quantity of cells exhi-

biting γH2AX foci increases as more cells enter S phase and
additional breaks are generated. In cells with intact BRCA2
expression, the HDR pathway actively repairs DSBs soon after they occur, reducing the number of cells exhibiting
γH2AX foci at the 24-hour time point. In addition, the results
show that pol β inhibition by LCA leads to even greater generation of DSBs, as would be expected from the higher levels
of unrepaired BER intermediates.
Neutral pH comet assays were also used to assess the
generation of LCA- and/or temozolomide-induced DSBs in
BRCA2-deficient cells and yielded results consistent with
γH2AX immunofluorescence (data not shown). Under neutral
pH conditions, the DNA is not subjected to alkaline unwinding
and the assay does not detect SSBs. Increased comet tail moments therefore indicate a greater quantity of DSBs in cells.

Discussion
The discovery of novel chemotherapeutic adjuvants represents an important step toward improving options for
cancer treatment. Here, we have shown that LCA can be
used to potentiate the effectiveness of a well-known chemotherapeutic agent in cells exhibiting a prevalent tumorigenic
mutation. We observed that LCA reduces BER activity via
inhibition of the DNA polymerase and the 5′-dRP lyase activities of pol β. γH2AX immunofluorescence shows that
LCA and temozolomide cotreatment generates persistent
DSBs that can only be repaired effectively when the HDR
pathway is functional. To the best of our knowledge, this
is also the first study to show the increased susceptibility
of BRCA2-deficient cell lines to treatment with temozolomide or LCA.
The BER pathway has previously been identified as a target for temozolomide potentiation using inhibitors of the
PARP protein family (12, 13). Our work serves to corroborate molecular targeting of BER as a viable methodology in
cancer therapy. Although the PARP enzymes PARP-1 and
PARP-2 are known to promote BER activity, their specific
roles within the pathway remain uncharacterized. The biochemical function of pol β and the effects of its inactivation
on BER have been extensively documented (32–35). We
show here that the DNA polymerase and 5′-dRP lyase functionalities of pol β in short-patch BER represent distinct
targets of LCA inhibition. The inability of pol β to complex
with template DNA in the presence of LCA is consistent
with earlier nuclear magnetic resonance characterization
showing that pol β–LCA interaction occurs through the
NH2-terminal 8-kDa template-binding domain of pol β but
not the 31-kDa catalytic domain (36).
Temozolomide generates a relatively narrow spectrum of
DNA base damage. N 7 -methylguanine (N 7 -MeG) and N 3methyladenine (N3-MeA), composing ∼80% of the induced
lesions, are recognized by DNA glycosylases and are therefore
substrates for the BER pathway (37, 38). In addition to exogenous damage, an average cell may experience as many as
10,000 spontaneous DNA lesions each day (39). Temozolomide cytotoxicity in HDR-deficient cells seems to be a result
of the inability of BER to efficiently repair the vast number of

the number of lesions that progress into DSBs. The use of
LCA and other BER inhibitors as adjuvants to treatment with
temozolomide or similar alkylating agents offers a promising
means to increase efficacy in resistant tumors. Besides LCA,
we have also tested the chemically related betulinic acid and
oleanolic acid. However, neither yielded differential effects on
BRCA2-deficient versus BRCA2-proficient cell lines (data not
shown).
Defects in HDR represent a significant subset of tumorigenic germ-line mutations. Certain inherited loss-of-function
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been reported to confer
as high as 81% and 85% risks of breast cancer and 54% and
23% risks of ovarian cancer by age 80, respectively, whereas
the lifetime risks of breast and ovarian cancer among women
in general have been estimated at 12.5% and 1.8% (43, 44).
Evidence is also accumulating for the involvement of BRCA2
mutations in predisposition to numerous other cancers in
both males and females (45–47). BRCA2 is also known to play

Figure 4. The synergistic effect of LCA on the cytotoxicity of
temozolomide depends on a functional pol β. Clonogenic survival of
AAG-WT (A) and AAG-null (B) MEF cell lines modified to stably express
exogenous WT or dominant-negative (E295K mutant) pol β, as indicated.
Statistically significant differences at the P < 0.05 level (*) between
treatment with 1 mmol/L temozolomide or 1 mmol/L temozolomide +
50 μmol/L LCA were observed only in cells expressing WT pol β. The
BER-deficient E295K mutants exhibited no significant difference in
cytotoxicity between the treatments, indicating that LCA exerted no
cytotoxic effects in the absence of WT pol β function.

exogenous and endogenous lesions, leading to the accumulation of BER intermediates and subsequent formation of
DSBs. The γH2AX immunofluorescence data presented here
show that temozolomide treatment leads to persistent DSBs
even in the absence of LCA inhibition, which are likely responsible for cytotoxicity through induction of apoptotic
pathways. The toxicity of LCA alone presumably relies on
the frequency of endogenous lesions to generate DSBs.
BRCA2-deficient cells are more susceptible to LCA than proficient cells, and this sensitivity is increased when also treated with temozolomide.
The lowered efficacy of temozolomide treatment in some
tumors has generated much interest in cellular pathways mediating DNA alkylation resistance. Promoter methylation of
the gene encoding O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG)-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which directly repairs the temozolomide-induced O6-MeG lesion, is associated with improved
prognosis and increased sensitivity to alkylation treatment
(40–42). Because the predominant N7-MeG and N3-MeA lesions are BER rather than MGMT substrates, inhibition of
BER activity could potentially enhance the effectiveness of
temozolomide as a chemotherapeutic agent by increasing

a role in sporadic tumorigenesis, as it is silenced by binding
of the EMSY protein to exon 3 in sporadic breast and ovarian
cancer, in which the EMSY gene is amplified in 13% and 17%
of tumors, respectively (26). This amplification leads to increased silencing of the BRCA2 gene and has been correlated
with a negative disease prognosis (48). Treatment strategies
specifically exploiting inefficient HDR in BRCA2-deficient tumors thus have the potential to improve the specificity and
efficacy of cancer therapy while simultaneously minimizing
healthy tissue toxicity.
