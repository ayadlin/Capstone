Abstract
STAT3 has important functions in both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment to facilitate cancer
progression. The STAT regulatory kinase Janus-activated kinase (JAK) has been strongly implicated in promoting
oncogenesis of various solid tumors, including the use of JAK kinase inhibitors such as AZD1480. However, direct
evidence that JAK drives STAT3 function and cancer pathogenesis at the level of the tumor microenvironment is
yet to be established clearly. In this study, we show that AZD1480 inhibits STAT3 in tumor-associated myeloid
cells, reducing their number and inhibiting tumor metastasis. Myeloid cell–mediated angiogenesis was also
diminished by AZD1480, with additional direct inhibition of endothelial cell function in vitro and in vivo. AZD1480
blocked lung inﬁltration of myeloid cells and formation of pulmonary metastases in both mouse syngeneic
experimental and spontaneous metastatic models. Furthermore, AZD1480 reduced angiogenesis and metastasis
in a human xenograft tumor model. Although the effects of AZD1480 on the tumor microenvironment were
important for the observed antiangiogenic activity, constitutive activation of STAT3 in tumor cells themselves
could block these antiangiogenic effects, showing the complexity of the JAK/STAT signaling network in tumor
progression. Together, our results indicated that AZD1480 can effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis mediated by STAT3 in stromal cells as well as tumor cells. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6601–10. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor development is affected by signaling within the
cancer cells and their interactions with surrounding tissues
composed of extracellular matrix components and stromal
cells including endothelial cells and immune cells (1). The local
tumor microenvironment responds to signaling through
inﬂammatory cells, which release cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors to stimulate tumor growth via increased invasion potential of tumor cells. These signals also create immunosuppressive networks that enhance tumor survival (2).
STAT3 is a point of convergence for multiple oncogenic

signaling pathways. Constitutive activation of STAT3 within
tumor cells as well as stromal cells promotes cancer cell
proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune evasion
(3). Activated STAT3 downregulates Th1 cytokines and other
mediators critical for potent antitumor immune responses.
STAT3-driven tumor-derived factors, including interleukin
(IL)-6, IL-10, and VEGF, establish a crosstalk between tumor
cells and tumor-associated immune cells to ensure persistent
STAT3 activation in the tumor microenvironment, thereby
creating a "feed-forward loop" (4–7). Activated STAT3 in
tumor-associated immune cells leads to expression of a large
number of growth factors, angiogenic factors, and other molecules crucial for invasion and metastasis (8–10).
The importance of IL-6 in cancer development and progression has been widely documented (11–13). A critical role of
Janus-activated kinase (JAK) in mediating IL-6–induced STAT3
activation has also been established. Although JAK has been
viewed as a critical target for treating malignancies of hematopoietic origins, recent studies show its importance in various
solid tumors (14). Recently, JAK has also been shown to
facilitate sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1)induced persistent STAT3 activation in both tumor cells and
tumor stromal cells (9). We recently showed that AZD1480 is a
potent, competitive small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1/2 kinase,
and that it is capable of inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation and
tumor growth in a STAT3-dependent manner (14). Although
tumor growth was inhibited directly in vivo in each tumor
model tested, in some tumor cell lines, AZD1480 did not block
tumor cell growth in vitro at levels that produced maximal

inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation (14). This suggests the
potential important effects of AZD1480 on the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling. AZD1480 is
currently in early clinical trials for solid and hematologic
malignancies (15). Our current study shows that AZD1480
inhibits tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in part by affecting
the tumor microenvironment.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
AZD1480 was provided by AstraZeneca and dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for in vitro studies. For in vivo
experiments, AZD1480 was suspended in water supplemented
with 0.5% hypromellose and 0.1% Tween 80. All solvents are
from Sigma. Mouse IL-6 was purchased from R&D Systems.
Antibodies against phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3; Tyr705),
phosphorylated JAK2 (p-JAK2; Tyr1007/1008), JAK2, cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175; 5A1E), and matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9; G657) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antibodies against STAT3 (C-20) and VEGF (A-20) were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Cell lines
Renca murine cell line was a gift from Dr. Alfred Chang
(University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI).
Human renal cell carcinoma cell line 786-O was generously
provided by Dr. William G. Kaelin (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA). The 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cell line and the
Calu-6 lung carcinoma cell line were from American Type
Culture Collection. Mouse endothelial cell line derived from
prostate and colon was kindly provided by S. Huang and J. Fidler
(MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). All the above cell
lines were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) or RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS (Sigma). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Clonetics and cultured on collagen I–coated plates in their complete medium (Clonetics). 786-O constitutively active STAT3
mutant (STAT3C) and vector-expressing control cell lines were
generated and maintained as described previously (16).
Animal models and drug administration
Female BALB/c and athymic nude (NCR nu/nu) mice (7–8
weeks old) were obtained from National Cancer Institute
(Bethesda, MD) and Taconic Laboratories. Animal use procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees of Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope and
AstraZeneca. For subcutaneous tumor model, 2.5  106 Renca or
786-O cells suspended in 100 mL PBS were injected into the ﬂank
of BALB/c or nude mice, respectively. When average tumor
volume reached approximately 100 to 150 mm3, AZD1480 or
vehicle was administered by oral gavage either once a day at the
dose of 50 mg/kg or twice daily at 30 mg/kg, as indicated. Tumor
size was measured by caliper every other day. For experimental
lung metastasis model, 0.1  106 Renca or 1  106 786-O cells
suspended in 500 mL PBS were injected via tail vein to BALB/c or
nude mice, respectively. Three days later, mice were orally
treated with AZD1480 (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 21 days for

Renca tumors and 60 days for 786-O tumors, respectively. For
the Calu-6 model, 3  106 tumor cells in Matrigel were implanted
subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of nude mice, randomized into
vehicle [twice daily (BID)] and drug treatment (AZD1480, 30 mg/
kg BID) groups, and dosed orally daily for 19 days. For spontaneous lung metastasis model, 2  105 4T1 cells suspended in
100 mL PBS were injected in the mammary gland of female
BALB/c mice by gently penetrating the skin. AZD1480 (50 mg/
kg/d) or vehicle was given orally for 21 days.
Flow cytometry
Cell suspensions from spleen, tumor, or lung were prepared
as described previously (7) and stained with ﬂuorochromeconjugated CD11b and Gr1 antibodies (BD Biosciences). Data
were collected by CyAn ADP Violet Cytometer (Dako Cytomation) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star).
In vivo Matrigel plug assay
Growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) containing Renca tumor cells and splenic CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid
cells enriched from Renca tumor–bearing mice (ratio, 1:10)
were implanted subcutaneously into BALB/c mice. Five days
after implantation, AZD1480 (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was given
orally for 4 days. For the Calu-6 Matrigel plug assay, 5  106
tumor cells in Matrigel were implanted into nude mice which
were then treated twice daily, beginning on day 2, with vehicle,
30 mg/kg AZD1480, or 6 mg/kg VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
inhibitor, orally for 7 days. The plugs were harvested for
hemoglobin content measurement by colorimetry with Drabkin's reagent (Sigma), and frozen sections of the Renca tumor
plugs were stained for CD31.
In vitro tube formation assay
Mouse endothelial cells or HUVECs (5  104 cells per well in
1% FBS RPMI-1640 medium) were seeded on 48-well plates
coated with 100 mL of growth factor–reduced Matrigel. Five
percent of Renca tumor–conditioned medium (collected from
cultured Renca tumor cells) with varying doses of AZD1480 or
DMSO was added. After 16 hours, capillary-like tube formation
was quantiﬁed by manually counting the cord junctions with at
least 3 branches formed by endothelial cells.
Wound-healing migration assay
Mouse endothelial cells were grown on 6-well plates,
"wounds" were made by scratching on the conﬂuent cells with
a pipette tip. The number of cells migrated into the wound
area was counted after incubation with DMSO or AZD1480
(1 mmol/L) for 24 hours.
Cell viability assay
Renca or 786-O cells suspended in DMEM medium with 5%
FBS were seeded in 96-well plates (5,000 per well) to allow
adhesion and then treated with DMSO or AZD1480 for 48
hours. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay (Promega)
according to instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured with Mikrotek Laborsysteme. Mouse endothelial cells
and splenic CD11bþ/c myeloid cells enriched from tumorbearing mice were cultured in 5% FBS RPMI-1640 medium.

JAK/STAT3 as Target in the Tumor Microenvironment

HUVECs were cultured on collagen 1–coated plates in complete medium (Clonetics). All cells are treated with DMSO and
AZD1480 at various doses for 24 hours. Cell viability was
determined by counting cell number manually. All the experiments were repeated 3 times.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescent staining of tumor or lung frozen tissue
sections was described previously (10). To prepare lung sections, mouse lungs were perfused with PBS to eliminate
circulatory blood. All the representative images were obtained
under 200 magniﬁcation. CD31þ blood vessels or CD11bþ
myeloid cells were counted in 6 random ﬁelds (200).
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR were
described previously (16). The primers for mouse vegf, il1-b,
mmp9, ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (fgf-2), s100a8, s100a9, and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased
from Super Array Bioscience.
Western blotting
Harvested cells were lysed, and tissue samples were homogenized with a homogenizer (PowerGen; Fisher Scientiﬁc) with
modiﬁed radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Equal
amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.
Evaluation of lung metastasis
Mouse lungs were perfused by intratracheal injection of
India ink (15% India ink, 85% water, and 3 drops of NH4OH per
100 mL) and ﬁxed in Fekete's solution (300 mL of 70% ethanol,
30 mL of 37% formaldehyde, and 5 mL of glacial acetic acid) for
10 minutes. Metastatic nodules were counted. For histologic
evaluation of lung micrometastases, 5 sections of lung from
each mouse were stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) and
examined under light microscope. The number of micrometastatic foci per ﬁeld (40) was counted in all 5 sections.
Intravital multiphoton microscopy
Implantation of 786-O-pRC-vector or 786-O-pRC-STAT3C
tumor cells into nude mice and treatment with AZD1480 or
vehicle were described previously (14). Tumor vasculature,
apoptosis, and extracellular matrix were visualized by dextran–rhodamine (red; Invitrogen), Annexin V (green; BioVision), and Hoechst 33342 (blue; Sigma).
Statistics
The 2-tailed Student t test was used for statistical analysis.
Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant when
P < 0.05.  , P < 0.001;  , P < 0.01; and  , P < 0.05.

Results
AZD1480 inhibits Renca tumor growth in vivo with a
reduction in tumor myeloid cell inﬁltration
Our previous studies indicated that although AZD1480
could induce tumor growth inhibition and tumor cell apopto-

sis in vivo, in certain tumor cell lines it did not effectively inhibit
tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro (14).
Consistent with this observation, we found that AZD1480
treatment of 786-O human renal cancer cells and mouse Renca
cells in vitro had only limited reduction in cell viability (Fig. 1A,
left and Supplementary Fig. S1A), although p-JAK2 and pSTAT3 were inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S1B and Fig. 1A,
right). These ﬁndings prompted us to investigate the in vivo
antitumor effects of AZD1480 on Renca, a syngeneic murine
renal carcinoma model. Renca tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice and treated with AZD1480 (50
mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 21 days. We observed a signiﬁcant (P <
0.001) inhibition of tumor growth in AZD1480-treated group
compared with vehicle-treated group (Fig. 1B, top). Western
blot analyses of the whole tumor lysates revealed a dramatic
inhibition of p-STAT3 by AZD1480 treatment (Fig. 1B, bottom).
These results suggest that AZD1480 has signiﬁcant antitumor
effects in vivo, with inhibition of STAT3 signaling.
The tumor microenvironment is a complex system composed of many types of cells, many of which play crucial
roles in tumor progression (17). In particular, tumor-associated myeloid cells are an important component of the
tumor microenvironment that regulates tumor growth
and responses to anticancer therapies (18, 19). We investigated the effect of targeting the JAK/STAT3 signaling
pathway with AZD1480 on tumor-associated myeloid cells.
CD11bþ/Gr1þ myeloid cells [myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC)] in spleens and tumors were quantiﬁed by
ﬂow cytometric analyses in Renca tumor–bearing mice
after 21 days of treatment. We observed a 2- to 3-fold
reduction of MDSCs in AZD1480-treated groups compared
with vehicle groups (P < 0.01), as shown in Fig 1C. It has
been shown that constitutively activated STAT3 not only
plays a critical role in tumor cell signaling but also stimulates the accumulation of tumor-associated myeloid cells
(7). Therefore, we evaluated whether STAT3 signaling could
be regulated by AZD1480 in myeloid cells. Tumor-inﬁltrating CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid cells isolated from tumorbearing mice after 14 days of treatment were analyzed.
STAT3 phosphorylation was potently inhibited in
AZD1480-treated group, and STAT3-dependent, angiogenic, and metastasis-promoting factors, VEGF, IL-1b, FGF-2,
and MMP9, were downregulated in tumor-inﬁltrating
CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore,
immunostaining of Renca tumor sections for CD11b also
indicated a dramatic reduction of CD11bþ myeloid cell
inﬁltration after AZD1480 administration (Fig. 1E). To
identify whether AZD1480 directly affects myeloid cell
tumor–promoting functions, we conducted an ex vivo
migration assay to examine the effect of AZD1480 on
myeloid cell motility. Splenic CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid
cells isolated from Renca tumor–bearing mice were subjected to a Transwell migration assay. The percentage of
migrated myeloid cells was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) inhibited
by AZD1480 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2B, left), and a reduction of p-STAT3 by
AZD1480 treatment in CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid cells was
also observed (Supplementary Fig. S2B, right).

JAK/STAT3 as Target in the Tumor Microenvironment

AZD1480 inhibits tumor angiogenesis in Renca tumor
model
We next investigated the antiangiogenic effect of AZD1480
on Renca tumors. Following 10 days of treatment, tumors were
collected and immunostained for endothelial cell marker
CD31. We observed a more than 3-fold reduction of CD31þ
tumor blood vessels in AZD1480-treated mice compared with
vehicle treated (Fig. 2A), along with downregulation of VEGF
and MMP9 in whole tumor lysates (Fig. 2B). Emerging evidence
has indicated that tumor-associated myeloid cells are important sources of proangiogenic factors in the tumor microenvironment (20, 21), and our group has previously shown that
constitutively activated STAT3 in tumor-associated myeloid
cells plays a crucial role in promoting tumor angiogenesis (10).
We therefore analyzed the effect of AZD1480 on myeloid cell–
induced angiogenesis in a modiﬁed Matrigel angiogenesis
assay. Matrigel plugs containing a mixture of Renca tumor
cells and CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid cells (a ratio of 1:10)
enriched from spleens of tumor-bearing mice were implanted
into BALB/c mice and analyzed by immunostaining for CD31.
We found a potent reduction of neovasculature in AZD1480

more than 7-fold reduction in CD31þ vasculature comparing
AZD1480 with vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2C, middle). Measurement of hemoglobin content of Matrigel plug also showed
that AZD1480 signiﬁcantly reduced neovascularization (P <
0.01; Fig. 2C, right). Taken together, these data suggest that
AZD1480 inhibits STAT3 signaling and tumor angiogenesis, at
least, in part, by targeting tumor-associated myeloid cells, in
the Renca tumor model. Furthermore, inhibition of vascularization of Matrigel plugs and tumor growth has also been
observed in the Calu-6 lung carcinoma xenograft model and in
association with inhibition of p-STAT3 and induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). The extent of antiangiogenic
effect is comparable with that observed with VEGFR inhibitors
(22).
To examine whether targeting STAT3 by AZD1480 directly
inhibits the function of endothelial cells, we analyzed tube
formation activity of both mouse endothelial cells and HUVECs
in the presence or absence of AZD1480. AZD1480 inhibited
both mouse and human endothelial cell tube formation
induced by Renca tumor–conditioned medium in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A). In addition, the effect of AZD1480
on mouse endothelial cell migration was measured by a

wound-healing assay. We observed a signiﬁcant reduction in
the number of cells that migrated into the wound area (P <
0.01; Fig. 3B). The doses required to inhibit endothelial cell tube
formation and migration were noticeably less than those that
affect the viability of mouse and human endothelial cells (Fig.
3A and B and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover, p-STAT3
was evaluated in mouse endothelial cells after treatment of
AZD1480 for 2 hours followed by 30 minutes stimulation of
Renca tumor–conditioned medium. We observed that 0.5
mmol/L of AZD1480 potently inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation
induced by Renca tumor–conditioned medium (Fig. 3C).

AZD1480 inhibits lung metastasis and factors important
for premetastatic niche formation
STAT3 has been implicated in tumor migration and metastasis (9, 23, 24). Therefore, we tested the effect of AZD1480 on

6606

an experimental lung metastasis model. Renca cells were
injected into BALB/c mice, and AZD1480 or vehicle was given
orally 3 days after implantation. As shown in Fig 4A, the
number of metastatic lung nodules was signiﬁcantly reduced
on day 21 by AZD1480 treatment compared with vehicle
treatment (P < 0.01). Western blot analysis of whole lung
lysates revealed reduced p-STAT3, VEGF, and MMP9 (Fig.
4B). It has been shown that the primary tumor inﬂuences the
lung environment before metastasis occurs (25), and inﬁltration and accumulation of tumor-associated myeloid cells into
the lung play a crucial role in the development of metastasis
(26). Thus, we examined whether subcutaneous primary tumor
inﬂuenced myeloid cell inﬁltration into the lung and whether
AZD1480 treatment blocked this process. We analyzed lung
myeloid cell inﬁltration by immunoﬂuorescent staining in
subcutaneous Renca tumor model and found a signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) reduction of CD11bþ myeloid cells in the lungs after
14 days of treatment with AZD1480 (Fig. 4C). These results
indicate that AZD1480 can inhibit Renca tumor metastasis.
AZD1480 inhibits spontaneous lung metastasis and
modulates the metastatic environment
We also investigated the effect of AZD1480 on 4T1, a
syngeneic mouse mammary carcinoma model that spontaneously develops lung metastasis. 4T1 tumor cells were orthotopically implanted into the mammary glands of mice, and
AZD1480 or vehicle was orally administered 3 days after tumor
challenge. The number of lung metastatic nodules was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced after 21 days of AZD1480 treatment
compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 5A). Meanwhile, we
examined lung myeloid cell inﬁltration in 4T1 tumor-bearing
mice by ﬂow cytometry. We observed a 2- to 4-fold reduction of
CD11bþ/Gr1þ myeloid cells in the lungs as early as 4 days after
initial AZD1480 treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 5B, left). Lung tissue
sections were subjected to immunoﬂuorescent staining for
CD11b antibody. A reduction of lung myeloid cell inﬁltration
after 8 days of AZD1480 treatment was shown (Fig. 5B, right).
Furthermore, we examined STAT3 signaling in pulmonary
CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid cells by either western blotting or
real-time PCR. As shown in Fig 5C, p-STAT3 along with VEGF
and MMP9, as well as s100a8 and s100a9, all of which have been
shown to be important in myeloid cell–mediated distant site
metastasis, were inhibited after treatment with AZD1480
compared with vehicle group. To further address the effects
of AZD1480 on the ability of myeloid cells to attract 4T1
tumor cells, we conducted an ex vivo migration assay.
CD11bþ/CD11c myeloid cell–conditioned medium was used
to induce 4T1 tumor cell migration. The number of migrated
tumor cells was signiﬁcantly decreased in AZD1480 treatment
group (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken together, these
results suggest that AZD1480, by targeting STAT3 signaling,
potently reduced the inﬁltration of myeloid cells into the lung,
which could inhibit tumor cell distant colonization.

cell carcinoma, in xenograft models (14). We determined
here whether AZD1480 could also inhibit tumor growth
through antiangiogenesis or antimetastasis in 786-O human
renal cell carcinoma xenografts. Western blot analyses of the
whole tumor lysates showed a dramatic inhibition of
p-STAT3 by AZD1480 treatment (Fig. 6A). Tumor sections
were immunostained with CD31 antibody to detect tumor
vessels after AZD1480 or vehicle treatment for 35 days. As
shown in Fig 6B, AZD1480 treatment led to a 2- to 2.5-fold
reduction in CD31þ blood vessels in 786-O xenografts
(P < 0.05). We also examined inﬁltrating myeloid cells in
tumors by immunostaining for CD11b. The number of
tumor CD11bþ myeloid cells was signiﬁcantly decreased
after AZD1480 treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 6C). To determine
whether the reduction in myeloid cells correlated with
inhibition of lung metastasis, we investigated the effect of
AZD1480 on an experimental pulmonary metastasis model
induced by 786-O tumor cells. Lung tissue was collected and
analyzed for metastasis after 2 months of treatment. Seven
of 8 mice in vehicle group developed metastasis on histologic examination, whereas only 3 of 7 mice in AZD1480
group developed metastases. The number of micrometastatic nodules per ﬁeld in the vehicle group was also signiﬁcant higher (P < 0.05) than that of AZD1480-treated mice
(Fig. 6D). These results further indicate that AZD1480 inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis in 786-O xenografts, which
is associated with inhibition of myeloid cells by AZD1480
treatment.
Because AZD1480 also inhibits JAK2/STAT3 in tumor cells,
we investigated the effect of constitutive STAT3 within tumor
cells signaling on the tumor stromal angiogenic environment.
We stably transfected 786-O cells with either STAT3C (27) or
control vector, challenged the tumor cells into athymic nude

mice, and observed the effects of AZD1480 on angiogenesis.
Intravital multiphoton laser microscopy was used to visualize
tumor vasculature in living mice. As shown in Fig 6E, 786-O
xenografts expressing STAT3C showed resistance to AZD1480induced angiogenesis inhibition compared with vector control.
These data indicate that despite the antiangiogenic activity of
AZD1480 within the tumor microenvironment, tumor autonomous STAT3 signaling can interact with stroma to promote
tumor angiogenesis.

Discussion
Previous work has established the importance of JAK1/2 in
STAT3-dependent tumorigenesis, and inhibition by AZD1480
resulted in blockage of tumor growth, although direct inhibitory effects on tumor cells were not evident in vitro in some cell
lines (14). Moreover, AZD1480 treatment of myeloma cells
resulted in decreased tumor proliferation and the induction of
apoptosis, which could be seen in the presence of bone marrow
stromal cells (28). Our current work shows the effects of
AZD1480 on modulating JAK/STAT3 signaling in the tumor
microenvironment and reducing tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis.
A complex multidirectional interaction exists between
tumor cells, surrounding stroma and the microenvironment
at metastatic sites (19, 29). The accumulation of myeloid
cells has been shown to create a permissive environment at
distant organs for metastasis to occur (25, 29–31). In the
premetastatic niche, recruited myeloid cells in concert with
endothelial cells and stromal cells produce a milieu of
chemokines, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteases,
and proteins essential for tumor cell invasion to facilitate
metastasis (25). It has been shown that STAT3 promotes

interact with myeloid and endothelial cells, and STAT3
within myeloid cells then stimulates endothelial cells
resulting in tumor growth, migration, and angiogenesis
(10), thereby playing an important role in metastatic potential. Our study provides evidence that JAK/STAT3 signaling
within the primary tumor microenvironment is critical for
myeloid cell inﬁltration and the formation of tumor vasculature. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3-mediated myeloid inﬁltration and angiogenesis with AZD1480 dramatically decreased the formation of metastases. In addition,

when a constitutively activated mutant form of STAT3 was
introduced into the tumor cells, treating mice with
AZD1480 was not able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis.
These results support the importance of factors produced
by tumor cells in promoting tumor angiogenesis, and
suggest that the antiangiogenic effects of AZD1480 are
partly mediated by blocking JAK/STAT3 in tumor cells,
highlighting a tumor autonomous mode of antiangiogenic
activity distinct from that of VEGFR inhibitors. Taken
together, blocking JAK/STAT3 activity with AZD1480 may
have promise in the treatment of solid malignancies by
