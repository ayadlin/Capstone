Abstract
Adult T-cell /lymphomaleukemia (ATLL) is caused by human
T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Approximately 80%
of ATLL patients develop humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM), a life-threatening complication leading to a
poor prognosis. Parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP)
and macrophage inflammatory protein-1A (MIP-1A) are
important factors in the pathogenesis of HHM in ATLL and
the expression of PTHrP can be activated by nuclear factor KB
(NF-KB). NF-KB is constitutively activated in ATLL cells and is
essential for leukemogenesis including transformation of
lymphocytes infected by HTLV-1. Our goal was to evaluate
the effects of NF-KB disruption by a proteasomal inhibitor
(PS-341) and osteoclastic inhibition by zoledronic acid (Zol)
on the development of ATLL and HHM using a novel bioluminescent mouse model. We found that PS-341 decreased cell
viability, increased apoptosis, and down-regulated PTHrP
expression in ATLL cells in vitro. To investigate the in vivo
efficacy, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD/SCID) mice were xenografted with ATLL cells and
treated with vehicle control, PS-341, Zol, or a combination
of PS-341 and Zol. Bioluminescent imaging and tumor cell
count showed a significant reduction in tumor burden in mice
from all treatment groups. All treatments also significantly
reduced the plasma calcium concentrations. Zol treatment
increased trabecular bone volume and decreased osteoclast
parameters. PS-341 reduced PTHrP and MIP-1A expression in
tumor cells in vivo. Our results indicate that both PS-341 and Zol
are effective treatments for ATLL and HHM, which are refractory to conventional therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11859–66]

Introduction
Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic
agent for adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL; ref. 1). Eighty
percent of ATLL patients develop humoral hypercalcemia of
malignancy (HHM), a severe complication resulting from increased
osteoclastic bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption (2).
HHM in ATLL patients leads to a mean survival of <1 year (3);
therefore, it is urgent to develop new therapies to sufficiently
reduce HHM and eliminate tumor progression in ATLL.

Nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) ligand is constitutively activated in
HTLV-1–infected cells, indicating the importance of NF-nB in ATLL
tumorigenesis (4). In addition, NF-nB binding sites were found in
the promoters of parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP;
refs. 5, 6) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a;
ref. 7). The levels of these two proteins are increased in the plasma
of ATLL patients with HHM (8, 9). PTHrP expressed in osteoblasts
and cancer cells enhances the expression of the receptor activator
of NF-nB ligand, an essential factor that activates osteoclastogenesis and regulates bone resorption. In the kidney, PTHrP
decreases calcium and increases cyclic AMP phosphorus excretion
(10). Therefore, PTHrP plays a major role in the pathogenesis of
HHM (10); however, recent studies have suggested that cytokines
and chemokines, such as MIP-1a, a chemoattractant and activator
of monocytes during inflammation, can induce osteoclastic bone
resorption and serve as a potential survival and osteoclast stimulatory factor in cancer (11). Increased concentrations of plasma
PTHrP and MIP-1a are reliable clinical biomarkers of hypercalcemia in ATLL and represent potential therapeutic targets (2, 9).
Proteasome inhibitors such as PS-341 inhibit the degradation of
InB family members, resulting in a suppression of NF-nB activity
(12). PS-341 has been used as a chemotherapeutic agent for relapsed multiple myeloma patients (13). In ATLL, PS-341 stabilized
InBa, InBh, InBq, p21, p27, and p53 proteins and induced apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest in HTLV-1–positive cells in vitro (14), but the
in vivo efficacy of PS-341 is still controversial (14, 15).
Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and
often used for the treatments of osteoporosis, Paget’s disease,
hyperparathyroidism, and tumor-induced osteolysis (16). Bisphosphonates inhibit the mevalonate pathway leading to disruption of
the Ras signaling pathway. In bone, inhibition of prenylation and
Ras signaling within osteoclasts inhibits intracellular vesicle transport, which is required for osteoclasts to form ruffled borders and
induce osteoclastic bone resorption. In vitro, high concentrations
of bisphosphonates induce S-phase cell cycle arrest and caspasedependent apoptosis (17, 18). Zoledronic acid (Zol), a thirdgeneration bisphosphonate, was shown to not only prevent
osteolytic bone destruction but also decrease tumor burden in
Tax transgenic mice (19).
Human xenograft models have been used to investigate new
therapeutic agents for ATLL (20). NOD/SCID mice can be
successfully engrafted with RV-ATL cells, a Tax-negative ATLL cell
line derived from an ATLL patient (21). These mice develop
mesenteric lymphoma and HHM 5 weeks after inoculation (22). We
successfully infected RV-ATL cells with a lentivirus containing the
luciferase gene and developed a bioluminescent mouse model for
ATLL to noninvasively monitor tumor cell engraftment and
progression and to measure the effects of treatments on tumor
burden. Due to the significance of NF-nB activity in ATLL
tumorigenesis and its potential role in the induction of HHM by

increasing PTHrP and MIP-1a expression, our goal was to
investigate the in vivo effect of PS-341 accompanied with the
osteoclastic inhibitor Zol on tumor burden and HHM in a novel
bioluminescent mouse model of ATLL. We found that the
combination of PS-341 and Zol may be an effective treatment for
ATLL.

Materials and Methods
Cells and drugs. RV-ATL cells derived from an ATLL patient were provided
by Dr. Feuer (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate
Medical University, Syracuse, NY; ref. 21). HTLV-1–transformed cell lines (MT2
and SLB-1), HTLV-1–negative T cells (Jurkat), and RV-ATL cells were cultured
as previously described (6). PS-341 was obtained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals through the NIH. Zol was purchased from Novartis.
Transduction of RV-ATL cells with luciferase gene. RV-ATL-luc cells
expressing luciferase were generated using a lentiviral vector as previously
described (23). Following transduction, the cells were incubated at 37jC for
1 h and washed twice with RPMI 1640 before i.p. injections in NOD/SCID mice.
Animals and treatments. Five-week-old male NOD/SCID (NOD CB17PRKDC-SCID/J) mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were housed and treated in
accordance with the University Laboratory Animal Resources guidelines
and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Laboratory
Animal Care and Use Committee. A total of 4  107 RV-ATL-luc cells were
injected i.p. 7 days before the initiation of treatments and mice were
randomly assigned into the vehicle control group or treatment groups,
which received PS-341 (0.4 mg/kg twice per week, i.p.), Zol (0.1 mg/kg twice
per week, s.c.), or a combination of the two drugs for 4 weeks. Tumor cells
were recovered from the mice by abdominal lavage at the end of the
experiment.
Cell viability and apoptosis assays. Cell viability was measured with
the CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega Corp.)
and trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Cell apoptosis assay was measured
with in situ cell death detection kit (Roche).
Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Western
blotting was done using standard protocols and antibodies against InBa
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), phospho-InBa (Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.), and actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) was done as previously described (5, 24) with specific oligonucleotide
primers for PTHrP (5¶-GTCTCAGCCGCCTCAA-3¶ and 5¶-GGAAGAATCGTCGCCGTAAA-3¶; ref. 24), PTHrP P1/P2 transcript (5¶-GAAGCAACCAGCCCACCAGA-3¶ and 5¶-TGAGACCCTCCACCGAGC-3¶; ref. 24), MIP-1a
(5¶-CTGCATCACTTGCTGCTGACA-3¶ and 5¶-CACTGGCTGCTCGTCTCAAAG-3¶; ref. 25), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; 5¶-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3¶ and 5¶-GAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3¶).
Bioluminescent imaging. Bioluminescent imaging was done with the
in vivo imaging system (IVIS, Xenogen Corp.) as previously described (23).
Photon signals were quantified with LivingImage software version 2.2
(Xenogen).
Measurement of plasma calcium and MIP-1A concentrations. Total
calcium concentration in plasma from each mouse was measured with the
QuantiChrom Calcium Assay kit (BioAssay Systems). Human MIP-1a levels
in plasma were measured with Human CCL3/MIP-1a Quantikine ELISA kit
(R&D systems) on pooled plasma from each group. Six non–tumor-bearing
age- and sex-matched mice were used as controls.
Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, enzymatic histochemistry
analyses, and histomorphometry. On sacrifice, a complete necropsy
was done on each animal. Tibias were removed, defleshed, fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin, decalcified, and stained with H&E for histopathologic evaluation. Enzymatic histochemistry for tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) was done as previously described (22).
Bone histomorphometry was done with the Image-Pro Plus, version 5.0
software (Media Cybernetics). Total bone volume, trabecular bone volume,
trabecular bone perimeter, and osteoclast perimeter and numbers were
measured.

Mouse Model and Therapy for ATLL
Statistical analysis. The main outcome variables in this study were cell
counts, apoptosis, percentage of viable cells, total calcium concentration,
PTHrP and MIP-1a expression, total bone volume, trabecular bone volume,
osteoclast perimeter, and trabecular bone perimeter. These are all
continuous variables. These variables were log transformed to carry out
the statistical analyses because the distributions in the original scale were
skewed. For all the variables that data were collected at a single time point,
ANOVA and nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis) were used for the analyses.
Pairwise comparisons were tested by Tukey’s, Holm’s, or Dunnett’s methods
to adjust for multiplicity. P values are reported in the caption of the

controls. PS-341 did not reduce MIP-1a significantly in vitro (data
not shown). To determine whether PS-341 was able to inhibit
NF-nB activity by inducing InBa accumulation in RV-ATL cells,
whole-cell lysates were extracted from RV-ATL cells treated with

Results
PS-341 and Zol significantly reduced cell viability and
induced apoptosis in ATLL cells. To examine the efficacy of
PS-341 and Zol in vitro, RV-ATL cells were treated with PS-341
and Zol for 48 h and cell viability was measured with 3-(4,5Dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and
trypan blue exclusion assays. PS-341 induced a dose-dependent
inhibition of cell viability by MTT assay (Fig. 1A) and trypan blue
exclusion assay (Fig. 1B). Similar results were found in other HTLV1–positive (MT-2 and SLB-1) or HTLV-1–negative (Jurkat) cell lines
treated with PS-341 (data not shown). There was also a decrease
of viability in cells treated with Zol at 50 to 200 Amol/L for 48 h
(Fig. 1C) by MTT assay. To examine the effects on apoptosis,
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assays were done on RV-ATL cells treated
with PS-341 and/or Zol for 48 h. PS-341 (20 nmol/L) significantly
induced apoptosis in 20.4% of the cells when compared with
vehicle control (10.4%), whereas Zol induced apoptosis in 22.2% of
the treated cells. When RV-ATL cells were treated with both PS-341
and Zol, no further increase in apoptotic cells was observed (25%;
Fig. 1D; P < 0.0001). These data showed the apoptotic potential of
PS-341 and Zol and showed that both drugs induced apoptosis
similarly in RV-ATL cells.
PS-341 inhibited PTHrP expression and induced the
accumulation of phosphorylated IKBA. The PTHrP P2 promoter
was shown to be activated by NF-nB (5, 6). PS-341, a proteasome
inhibitor, inhibits the degradation of InBa, a NF-nB inhibitor, in
multiple T-cell lines (14). To determine whether PS-341 had a
similar mechanism of action in RV-ATL cells, we treated RV-ATL
cells with PS-341 and measured the expression level of PTHrP
transcripts specifically transcribed from the P2 promoter by realtime RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, 20 nmol/L PS-341 down-

and real-time RT-PCR was done in triplicate with the TaqMan gene expression

20 or 100 nmol/L of PS-341 for 30 to 120 min and Western blotting
was done with antibodies specific for phosphorylated, total InBa,
and actin. As shown in Fig. 2B and C, PS-341 treatment resulted in
an accumulation of phosphorylated InBa in a time-dependent
manner. The accumulation of phosphorylated InBa has been
correlated with the inhibition of NF-nB activity in ED( ) cells,
another Tax-negative ATLL cell line (26), suggesting that PS-341
may have a similar mechanism of action to inhibit NF-nB activity in
RV-ATL cells.
PS-341 and Zol decreased tumor burden. To monitor in vivo
tumor growth noninvasively, we injected NOD/SCID mice with RVATL-luc cells generated by transducing RV-ATL cells with lentiviral
vectors encoding luciferase/yellow fluorescent protein. Signals

from bioluminescent imaging successfully represented the progression and location of tumor growth and tumor burden over time
(Fig. 3A). Mice bearing RV-ATL-luc cells developed HHM and
lymphoma predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes 5 weeks
after inoculation. To determine the in vivo efficacy of PS-341 and
Zol, mice were treated with PS-341 alone, Zol alone, or a combination of the two drugs beginning 1 week after inoculation. Bioluminescent imaging was done 21 and 28 days after treatments
began. Signals from bioluminescent imaging at day 28 were significantly lower in the mice treated with PS-341, Zol, or the
combination compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 3B and C;
P < 0.0001, P = 0.002, and P < 0.0001, respectively). Signals from day
21 showed similar results (data not shown). However, a wide range

bone resorption in vivo, bone histopathology and histomorphometry were done. Increased trabecular bone volume was present
in tibias from mice treated with Zol alone compared with vehicle
(Fig. 5A). Mice treated with a combination of the two drugs had a
similar phenotype (results not shown). Bone histomorphometry
revealed an f2.5-fold increase in trabecular bone volume/total
bone volume in Zol-treated and combination-treated mice
(Fig. 5B). A decrease in osteoclast perimeter/trabecular bone perimeter was also present in combination-treated mice (Fig. 5C),
indicating that Zol inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption in mice
bearing RV-ATL-luc cells.

of signal intensity was observed in mice treated with Zol alone
(Fig. 3C). To confirm the measurement of tumor burden by bioluminescent imaging, cells were extracted by abdominal lavage
and counted immediately after sacrifice (Fig. 3D). Similar to the
bioluminescent imaging results, there were significant differences
in cell numbers in mice treated with PS-341 alone, Zol alone, or the
combination compared with vehicle controls (P < 0.0001, P = 0.009,
and P < 0.0001, respectively). A wide range of cell numbers was
again observed in Zol alone group. Pearson correlation coefficient
analyses identified a strong correlation between bioluminescent
imaging signal intensities and cell numbers (Supplementary
Table S1; r =0.921, P < 0.0001), indicating that tumor burden can
be well represented by bioluminescent imaging. These data showed
that both PS-341 and Zol were able to reduce tumor burden in
mice bearing RV-ATL-luc cells.
PS-341 and Zol decreased HHM. To examine the efficacy of
PS-341 and Zol on HHM, we measured total plasma calcium
concentrations in the mice. Six non–tumor-bearing age- and sexmatched mice were used as controls. Tumor-bearing mice treated
with vehicle had significantly higher plasma calcium concentrations
(mean, 13.0 mg/dL; P = 0.0002) compared with the control mice
(mean, 10.6 mg/dL). Significant differences were found in mice
treated with PS-341 alone, Zol alone, and the combination of the two
drugs compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 4; P = 0.014, P = 0.004,
and P < 0.0001, respectively), indicating that PS-341 and Zol were able
to decrease hypercalcemia in vivo. No significant differences were
observed between PS-341 alone, Zol alone, or the combination group.
Most importantly, mice that received the combination of the two
drugs had plasma calcium concentrations that were indistinguishable
from non–tumor-bearing control mice (P = 1.00). Calcium concentrations were strongly correlated with signal densities from
bioluminescent imaging and cell numbers (Supplementary
Table S1; r = 0.816 and 0.781, respectively; both P < 0.0001). Therefore,
tumor burden played a significant role in the development of HHM.

Figure 6. PS-341 reduced PTHrP and MIP-1a expression in vivo . mRNA
was extracted from the cells obtained from abdominal lavage of tumor-bearing
mice treated with vehicle, PS-341, Zol, or the combination and from
non–tumor-bearing control mice. Real-time RT-PCR was done with primers
specific for human PTHrP (A) or MIP-1a (B). For MIP-1a expression levels,
mRNA from MT-2 cells was used as a calibrator. GADPH was used as an
internal control. *, P = 0.0002; **, P = 0.0009; ***, P < 0.0001, compared with

PS-341 decreased PTHrP and MIP-1A in vivo. Expression of
PTHrP and MIP-1a in cells from the abdomen of tumor-bearing
and non–tumor-bearing mice (controls) was measured by real-time
RT-PCR. High levels of PTHrP and MIP-1a expression were found
in the cells from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6A and B). PTHrP and
MIP-1a expression was decreased in mice treated with PS-341
alone and the drug combination but not in mice treated with Zol
alone. These data correlated with the circulating plasma MIP-1a
concentrations in the mice. The MIP-1a concentration in the
vehicle-treated mice was very high (2,000 pg/mL) compared with
the PS-341–treated mice (<10 pg/mL), the combination group
(<10 pg/mL), or the control group (non–tumor-bearing mice;
<10 pg/mL). Zol did not significantly decrease the plasma MIP-1a
concentration (1,870 pg/mL).

Discussion
Successful treatments for ATLL remain elusive despite medical
advances in the development of chemotherapeutic regimens and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

targeted chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin,
Oncovin, and prednisolone; nucleoside analogues; topoisomerase
inhibitors; IFN; zidovudine; arsenic trioxide; and monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat ATLL patients, but the prognosis is
still poor. The first potential ‘‘cure’’ of ATLL was associated with
bone marrow transplantation, but patients suffered from opportunistic infections (3). ATLL patients also develop severe HHM,
causing life-threatening hypercalcemia. Therefore, it is important
to investigate new treatments for ATLL, especially in patients
that have developed or have the potential to develop HHM. We
provide new data supporting the in vivo effects of a proteasome
inhibitor (PS-341) and an osteoclastic inhibitor (Zol) on tumor
burden and HHM using a bioluminescent mouse model of human
ATLL.
One of the major challenges of preclinical studies is the
development of relevant animal models. Xenograft mouse models
have proved to be useful in examining new treatment strategies for
ATLL. HHM occurs in 80% of the ATLL patients but is not
recapitulated in most of the ATLL animal models. In the RV-ATL
transplantation model, an immunodeficient mouse strain (NOD/
SCID) that lacks functional T cells and B cells was used for
inoculation. Mice bearing RV-ATL cells not only developed ascites
and lymphoma in mesenteric lymph nodes but, importantly, they
developed HHM 5 weeks after inoculation of tumor cells. Tumor
cells obtained by peritoneal lavage were used for passaging RV-ATL
cells in vivo due to the fact that the cells have a low level of viability
and proliferation in vitro. Because lymphoma/leukemia is not a
readily accessible cancer and it is not easy to measure tumor
burden noninvasively in vivo, the RV-ATL cells were successfully
transduced with a lentivirus containing the luciferase gene. Tumor
progression and burden were measured by bioluminescent
imaging; therefore, we are able to detect and monitor lymphoma
cell growth in abdominal organs before the presentation of clinical
manifestations. This represents the first bioluminescent animal
model of human ATLL that induces HHM and can be used for
preclinical studies.
Mice bearing RV-ATL-luc cells developed hypercalcemia, and
bone histomorphometric analyses revealed increased osteoclast
numbers in vehicle-treated tumor-bearing mice compared with
control mice. No significant differences in the trabecular bone
volume occurred between control and tumor-bearing mice.
Hypercalcemia observed in this model was likely multifactorial
and contributed by all the target organs of calcium regulation,
including bone, kidney, and the intestines. Osteolytic lesions that
occur in human patients are typically the result of disease
progression for months or years. To evaluate the efficacy of
therapeutic agents, 40 million cells were injected i.p. in the mice. At
the end of week 5, most tumor-bearing mice without treatment
met the guidelines for euthanasia. Therefore, we believe that
significant bone loss would have occurred if the mice were kept for
longer periods of time. In addition, Dr. Uchiyama’s lab reported a
xenograft model of ATLL cells with hypercalcemia and found
decreased bone formation rates in the absence of significant
differences in bone resorption. This suggested that hypercalcemia
in these mice was likely due to other target organs of calcium
regulation in addition to bone (27).
The complete mechanism of HHM development in ATLL is not
clear; however, in many types of cancer, PTHrP plays a central role
by stimulating osteoclasts and increasing bone resorption. It has

Mouse Model and Therapy for ATLL

PTHrP expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
5 to 7 weeks after infection with HTLV-1 in vitro.5 Although PTHrP
is likely very important in ATLL, the concentrations of PTHrP in
the serum do not always correlate with the degree of hypercalcemia in ATLL patients, suggesting that other factors are involved in
the development of HHM. In our study, we carried out real-time
RT-PCR and ELISA and found high expression of MIP-1a in
RV-ATL cells and increased MIP-1a in the plasma of mice bearing
RV-ATL-luc cells. These results are consistent with the findings
from other groups showing that MIP-1a is an osteoclastogenic
factor in myeloma (11, 30) and induces hypercalcemia in ATLL (9).
The detailed mechanisms of how PTHrP and MIP-1a stimulate
osteoclastogenesis in ATLL patients need to be explored in the
future.
NF-nB has been shown to be essential, although not sufficient,
for tumorigenesis (31). PS-341 is an effective and nonselective NFnB inhibitor and has been used as a chemotherapeutic agent in
relapsed multiple myeloma patients (13). In vivo, PS-341 partially
inhibited s.c. ATLL tumor growth in one xenograft animal model
(26), but Tan and Waldmann (32) found that PS-341 alone did
not prolong survival of mice bearing i.p. tumors. Tax transgenic
mice were heterogeneous in their response to PS-341 (15). In our
study, we found that PS-341 exhibited a profound antitumor effect
in vitro and in vivo. PS-341 significantly inhibited cell viability and
metabolism rate and induced apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, PS-341
dramatically decreased tumor burden in mice bearing RV-ATL
cells. The different results from these animal studies are likely due
to the different mouse strains, PS-341 dosage, and scheduling.
Importantly, PS-341 not only showed significant antitumor effects
but was also able to decrease HHM in tumor-bearing mice. Both
PTHrP and MIP-1a have been shown to be increased in ATLL
patients with HHM (9, 33). Therefore, inhibiting PTHrP and MIP-1a
may decrease the severity or incidence of HHM in ATLL. We
showed that PS-341 decreased the levels of PTHrP in ATLL cells
in vitro. PS-341 did not decrease MIP-1a mRNA expression
significantly in vitro (7). However, we found that PS-341 decreased
the levels of both PTHrP and MIP-1a in ATLL cells in vivo. We
speculate that the effect of PS-341 on MIP-1a in vivo was likely
indirect, which involves additional host factors (cytokines and
microenvironment) or signaling between different cell types.
Although some studies have shown that PS-341 reduced
osteoclast numbers and inhibited bone resorption in mouse
models of multiple myeloma (34–36), the effects were transient
and the direct effect of PS-341 on osteoclasts and the indirect

effects via inhibition of myeloma cells were not examined. In our
model, we speculate that PS-341 mediated disruption of tumor
cells and a reduction of tumor-related humoral factors, which
impaired osteoclast function (shown by a decrease in hypercalcemia). PS-341, however, was not able to decrease the osteoclast
numbers that were previously induced by humoral factors secreted
from the tumor cells. In contrast to Zol, little is known about the
distribution or action of PS-341 in bone, which may have direct or
indirect effects on osteoclasts. In addition, PS-341 is a nonspecific
26S proteasome inhibitor that affects multiple signaling pathways.
Its potential effects on calcium homeostasis due to regulation by
the kidney or intestines are unknown. Therefore, PS-341 may have
decreased hypercalcemia in this model through effects on the
kidney or intestines. In bone, it may have inhibited osteoclast
function or reduced osteoclast apoptosis, although it did not
change osteoclast numbers. Additional studies investigating the
effects of PS-341 on the kidney, intestines, and bone are required.
In addition to the well-known effect of Zol on inhibition of
osteoclastic bone resorption, its effect on cell viability and
apoptosis in cancer cells has been intensively studied. Direct
cytotoxicity of Zol has been shown in breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and myeloma cells (18, 37). Clinical trials for investigating
the effects of Zol on prevention and treatment of bone metastases
are ongoing. Importantly, we found that Zol induced ATLL cell
apoptosis in vitro and partially decreased tumor burden in vivo, in
addition to its inhibition of osteoclastic activity and HHM. There
was a wide variability in the tumor burden in Zol-treated mice in
our investigation and the reasons remain unknown; however, the
bone response to Zol was consistent as expected. The combination
of Zol with a chemotherapeutic agent has been used in several
clinical trials. It would be important to investigate whether PS-341
and Zol function synergistically in the future.
In conclusion, we developed a bioluminescent mouse model to
investigate new therapies for HHM and ATLL. We showed that the
combination of PS-341 and Zol was an effective treatment for a
mouse model of human ATLL and may prove to be an effective
therapy for human patients.
