Abstract

Author Manuscript

The KCNH voltage-dependent potassium channels (ether-á-go-go, EAG; EAG-related gene, ERG;
EAG-like channels, ELK) are important regulators of cellular excitability1-3 and have key roles in
diseases such as cardiac long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2)4, epilepsy5, schizophrenia6 and
cancer7. The intracellular domains of KCNH channels are structurally distinct from other voltagegated channels. The amino-terminal region contains an eag domain, which is comprised of a PerArnt-Sim (PAS) domain and a PAS-cap domain8, while the carboxy-terminal region contains a
cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD) which is connected to the pore through a
C-linker domain. Many disease-causing mutations localize to these specialized intracellular
domains, which underlie the unique gating and regulation of KCNH channels9. It has been
suggested that the eag domain may regulate the channel by interacting with either the S4-S5 linker
or the CNBHD8,10. Here we present a 2-Å resolution crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD
complex of the mouse EAG1 (mEAG1) channel. It displays extensive interactions between the eag
domain and the CNBHD, indicating that the regulatory mechanism of the eag domain involves
primarily the CNBHD. Surprisingly, the structure reveals that a number of LQT2 mutations at
homologous positions in hERG, and cancer-associated mutations in EAG channels, localize to the
eag domain-CNBHD interface. Furthermore, mutations at the interface produced dramatic effects
on channel gating demonstrating the important physiological role of the eag domain-CNBHD
interaction. Our structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of mEAG1 provides unique
insights into the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of KCNH channels.

KCNH channels have two large intracellular regions which underlie the specialized gating
and regulation of this channel family9 (Fig. 1a). The CNBHD in the carboxy-terminal region
shares similarity with the cyclic nucleotide-binding domains of cyclic nucleotide-gated
(CNG) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels11,12.

The CNBHD of KCNH channels, however, does not bind cyclic nucleotides and regulates
KCNH channel gating in a cyclic nucleotide-independent manner13. The amino-terminal
region contains an eag domain, not present in CNG and HCN channels, which also plays a
key role in channel gating. Comprised of a 110-amino acid PAS domain preceded by a
highly conserved 25-amino acid PAS-cap (Fig. 1a and supplementary Fig. 1), the eag
domain regulates activation and inactivation in EAG1, and deactivation in hERG1
channels9,14. Moreover, many of the human mutations that cause LQT2 and cancer localize
to the conserved eag domain15-17. In addition, high expression of a primate-specific isoform
of ERG (KCNH2-3.1), missing most of the eag domain, was shown to correlate with risk for
schizophrenia6. The mechanism underlying KCNH channel regulation by the eag domain
remains unclear. Two competing hypothesis have emerged. Some evidence suggests that the
eag domain interacts with the S4-S5 linker and directly regulates the movement of the S4
voltage sensor10,18. By contrast, other evidence favors the CNBHD as the interaction partner
of the eag domain9,14,19. Using fluorescence we found that the eag domain interacts directly
with the CNBHD with an affinity of 13.2 ± 2.3 μM (supplementary Fig. 2).
To uncover the mechanism for how the eag domain regulates the channel, we solved the Xray crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex to 2.0 Å resolution (supplementary
Table 1). There were eight chains in the asymmetric unit, four eag domains and four
CNBHDs. The spatial arrangement of the eag domains and CNBHDs within the asymmetric
unit showed three different eag domain-CNBHD interactions, termed interaction A, B and C
(supplementary Fig. 3). Interaction A, however, had significantly greater buried surface area
than the other interactions (supplementary Table 2) and was confirmed by mutagenesis
experiments in the intact channel (see Fig. 3 below). Therefore interaction A was designated
as the biological unit.

Fig. 1b shows the structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex in the biological unit. The
structure of the CNBHD (residues 552-720) includes the last 35 amino acids of the C-linker,
the CNBHD, and 22 amino acids of the post-CNBD region (Fig. 1b and supplementary Fig.
1). The structure of the eag domain (residues 16-136) includes the PAS domain and the last
10 amino acids of the PAS-cap domain. These structures share many similarities to
structures of CNBHDs and eag-domains crystallized alone. The CNBHD is similar to the
isolated structures of mEAG1 (RMSD=0.53 Å)12, mosquito ERG (RMSD=1.05 Å)20, and
zebrafish ELK (RMSD=1.39 Å)11. The PAS domain is similar to the isolated structures of
mEAG1 (RMSD=0.32 Å)21, hERG1 (RMSD=0.71 Å)8,21, and fruit-fly ELK (RMSD=0.62
Å)21, and also to the solution NMR structures of hERG119,22.

The interface between the eag domain and CNBHD in the co-crystal structure, however, is
entirely novel. When we mapped the positions of disease-causing mutations in KCNH
channels onto the structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex, an unexpected trend
emerged: many LQT2 mutations (at homologous positions in hERG1) and cancer-associated
mutations (in hEAG1) are located at the interface between the eag domain and CNBHD
(Fig. 1c, supplementary Fig. 4). These mutations, which alter channel gating as well as
trafficking to the membrane9,14, result in prolongation of the cardiac action potential (in
hERG1) and were documented in several primary cancer types (in hEAG1)15. For example,
position N34 in the eag domain, which forms hydrogen bonds with V634 of the CNBHD,

was shown to cause LQT2 (hERG1 N33T). In addition, Y44 of the eag domain forms an
interaction with I637 and G639 of the CNBHD. Y44H in hEAG1 is a mutation known to be
correlated with large intestine carcinoma15, and mutation at the equivalent position in
hERG1 (Y43C) causes LQT223 (Fig. 1c). G639 is a known LQT2 position (hERG1
G800W)23. These observations suggest that perturbation of the interaction between the eag
domain and the CNBHD underlies part of the pathophysiology of KCNH-related diseases.
Moreover, the clustering of so many mutations at the eag domain-CNBHD interface is
consistent with this interface found in the crystal representing the physiological architecture
of KCNH channels.

Author Manuscript

The interface between the eag domain and the CNBHD is extensive, with an average buried
solvent accessible surface area of ∼1400 Å2 (supplementary Table 2). The interface consists
of three sub-regions: (i) the intrinsic ligand motif of the CNBHD interacts with the αB helix
in the PAS domain, (ii) the βA and βB strands of the PAS domain interact with the postCNBHD segment of the CNBHD, and (iii) an amphipathic helix (αCAP) in the PAS-cap
domain forms an interaction with the β-roll of the CNBHD (Fig. 1a and b).

Author Manuscript

The interaction of the PAS domain (residues 57-61) directly with the intrinsic ligand motif
of the CNBHD was particularly surprising (Fig. 2a and 2b). Previous structures of isolated
CNBHD from mEAG112 and zebrafish ELK (zELK)11 showed a short loop (residues
697-701) following the αC helix occupies the space filled by cyclic nucleotides in canonical
cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (supplementary Fig. 1). This short loop was therefore
called the “intrinsic ligand”. Mutations in this intrinsic ligand were shown to regulate
channel activity, shifting the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and deactivation.
Interestingly, mutations in the eag domain of KCNH channels result in similar
alterations9,14,16. The interaction between the eag domain and the intrinsic ligand, and the
functional similarities between mutations in these domains, suggests that the intrinsic ligand
motif may be a critical determinant of the regulation of KCNH channels by the eag domain.
Another surprising site of interaction of the eag domain is the post-CNBHD region
(beginning with residue 702). This region, immediately C-terminal to the intrinsic ligand,
has been shown to mediate the regulation of KCNH channel function by a variety of cellular
signaling events, including phosphorylation, and interaction with kinases, integrins, and
Ca2+-calmodulin24-26. The eag domain-CNBHD structure shows that the post-CNBHD
region interacts with the βA-βB loop of the eag domain (Fig. 2a and 2c, supplementary Fig.
1). The interaction between the eag domain and the post-CNBHD region suggests that
KCNH channel regulation through the post-CNBHD region may involve its interaction
interface with the eag domain.

The crystal contains two different conformations of the eag domain-CNBHD complex. The
asymmetric unit is composed of four copies of the complex, related by a two-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (Fig. 2d). This results in two pairs of the complex (‘type I’ and
‘type II’ complexes) that are in a similar conformation within each pair (average RMSD =
0.16 Å), but a different conformation and B-factor distribution between pairs (RMSD = 0.96
Å) (Fig. 2d, supplementary Fig. 5). Alignment of the two conformations reveals that the
angle between the eag domain and the CNBHD differs by 5° and the distance between the

two domains differs by 1.8 Å (between D47 of the eag domain and E578 of the CNBHD)
(Fig. 2e and supplementary video 1). In addition, the αP helix (residues 649-651,
supplementary Fig. 1) undergoes a significant rearrangement between the two
conformations, possibly due, at least in part, to variation in the local crystal contacts (Fig. 2e
and supplementary video 1). These two conformations, if present in the intact channel,
suggest that the eag domain-CNBHD complex is not static and represent a possible
rearrangement associated with the gating regulation of the channel by the eag domain.

To determine the functional role of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction, we mutated the
interaction interface between the eag domain and the CNBHD in intact mEAG1 channels.
The interface contains a salt bridge between R57 in the αB helix of the PAS domain and
D642 in the β6 strand of the CNBHD (Fig. 3a and supplementary Fig. 4). This salt bridge is
present in both conformations of the biological unit and is not present in the other eag
domain-CNBHD interactions in the crystal. Notably, R57 and D642 are conserved
throughout the KCNH family (supplementary Fig. 1), and mutation of the R57 position in
hERG1 (hERG1 R56Q) causes LQT216. mEAG1 channels with mutations in the salt bridge
were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their currents were recorded. Individually the eag
domain R57D mutation and the CNBHD D642R mutation each produced a slowing of
activation with voltage steps to +50 mV (supplementary Fig. 6). This resulted primarily
from a new slow component to the activation time course and produced a three to five fold
delay of the time to 90% current amplitude when compared to wild-type channels (Fig. 3b)
(R57D, 225 ± 42 ms; D642R, 340 ± 25 ms; wild type, 71 ± 15 ms, P < 0.01, n = 9-10). No
changes in other biophysical properties of the channels were noted (supplementary Table 3).
Importantly, in the double charge reversal mutant, R57D+D642R, the time course of channel
activation was similar to wild-type (68 ± 23 ms, P > 0.05, n = 6), suggesting the salt bridge
was restored (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that the R57-D642 salt bridge is present in the
intact channel, consistent with interaction A being the biological unit. Additionally, these
results indicate that the eag domain regulates the activation of mEAG1 channels by
interaction with the CNBHD.

A third important region of interaction with the CNBHD is with the PAS-cap domain. The
PAS-cap domain constitutes the first 25 amino acids of the eag domain. This domain is
highly conserved within the KCNH family (supplementary Fig. 1) and has been shown to be
crucial for proper activation and inactivation gating in KCNH channels9,27. Strikingly, our
structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex reveals that an amphipathic helix (αCAP) of
the PAS-cap domain of mEAG1 interacts directly with the CNBHD (Fig. 4a). The structure
shows that αCAP is nestled between a hydrophobic patch of the PAS domain and the β4-β5
strands and β8-β9 loop of the CNBHD. The structure of the PAS-cap domain was previously
assessed using NMR of isolated eag domain from hERG110,19,22. Structural alignment
reveals that the PAS-cap domain in our eag domain-CNBHD complex is in a very different
orientation from the NMR structures (Fig. 4b). The orientation, however, is very similar to
recent X-ray crystallography structures of isolated eag domains from hERG1 and ELK21.
We propose that the spatial organization of the PAS-cap domain within the eag domainCNBHD complex recapitulates the native conformation of this domain in the intact channel,

and that the PAS-cap domain exerts its functional effects through its interaction with the
CNBHD.

Author Manuscript

Although the PAS-cap domain itself does not contain any known LQT2 mutations and only
one cancer-associated mutation (hEAG1, E19D), its surroundings are rich in pathological
loci, including hERG1 LQT2 mutation E788D28 (E627 in EAG1) in the β4 strand of the
CNBHD9,15. These mutations may alter the gating properties of the channel by destabilizing
the PAS-cap domain interaction with the CNBHD. To test this hypothesis, we measured the
currents from mEAG1 channels mutated in the PAS-cap domain (R7A-R8A and R7E-R8E)
and in the CNBHD region where the PAS-cap is bound (E627A and E627R). These
positions are highly conserved within the KCNH family (supplementary Fig. 1). The voltage
dependence of activation of the PAS-cap mutations R7A-R8A and R7E-R8E were
significantly shifted to more depolarized potentials, compared to wild-type channels (Fig.
4c, supplementary table 4). The CNBHD mutations also showed a robust depolarizing shift,
similar to that of the R7E-R8E mutant (Fig. 4c, supplementary table 4). Together, these
results suggest that the interaction between the PAS-cap domain and the CNBHD regulates
KCNH channel gating.

Author Manuscript

To model the orientation of the eag domain-CNBHD complex in the context of a four-fold
symmetrical ion channel, we aligned the CNBHD of the complex with the homologous Clinker/CNBD of the mHCN2 channel (PDB code 1Q5O), which shares 35% sequence
similarity with the CNBHD of mEAG1 (supplementary Fig. 1). The C-linker/CNBD in the
mHCN2 structure assembles as a tetramer with a four-fold axis of rotational symmetry, in
which the C-linker domains form most of the inter-subunit interactions29. While our
structure of the mEAG1 CNBHD lacks most of C-linker, the alignment resulted in a
concentric arrangement of the eag domain-CNBHD complex, where the eag domains are
positioned at the periphery of the C-linker/CNBHD tetramer (Fig. 4d). The post-CNBHD
region points away from the center and may be accessible for interaction with other proteins,
such as kinases and Ca2+-calmodulin, thought to regulate KCNH channels through sites in
the post-CNBHD26. Mutagenesis studies in hERG1 channels suggest that this arrangement
may exhibit domain swapping where the eag domain of one subunit interacts with the
CNBHD of a neighboring subunit9.

Author Manuscript

The eag domain and the CNBHD have been shown to be important regulatory domains of
the KCNH channel family. Mutations found in these regions lead to LQT2 and are
associated with cancer. The structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of mEAG1
demonstrates that the interaction interface between the two domains serves as a hotspot for
many of these mutations and provides a framework to better understand the mechanisms of
gating and regulation of KCNH channels. Furthermore, understanding the molecular
interactions within the KCNH channel complex, and their disruption in disease, may enable
design of novel therapies for these devastating conditions.

followed by a TEV cleavage site. The proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia
coli cells as previously described11, purified on a Ni2+ affinity column and then on an ionexchange (CNBHD) or size exclusion column (eag domain), following an overnight
cleavage with TEV at 4°C. The proteins were concentrated to about 475 μM, flash-frozen
and store at −80°C until use. The eag domain and the CNBHD were mixed in a 1:1 molar
ratio prior to experimentation. Crystals were grown at 20°C using sitting-drop vapor
diffusion by mixing a 2:1 (v/v) ratio of protein mixture and a reservoir solution containing
18% (w/v) PEG 3350, 1.8% (v/v) Tacsimate, 10 mM MnCl2 and 90 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.
The crystals diffracted to 1.995 Å and belong to space group P65 (supplementary Table 1,
supplementary Fig. 7). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the mouse
EAG1 CNBHD (PDB accession 4F8A) as the search model. The final model was refined to
a resolution of 1.995 Å with Rwork = 0.167 and Rfree = 0.197. Electrophysiology recordings
were performed using the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique on Xenopus
oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant channels as previously described11.

Mouse EAG1 (mEAG1) (accession codes NP034730.1 and GI:6754422) eag domain
(residues 6-136) and CNBHD (residues 552-712, 552-724 and 552-752) were subcloned
using 5′ NcoI and 3′ HindIII sites into a pETM11 vector containing an amino-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag followed by a Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV) cleavage site. The
internal NcoI restriction site in the CNBHD was removed via a silent mutation. Final
CNBHD boundaries were selected based of small-scale expression and purification
experiments (residues 552-724). All constructs had a GAM(G) cloning artifact sequence
introduced at the N-terminus. Full-length cDNA of mEAG1 was subcloned into the highexpression pGH19 vector for expression in Xenopus oocytes. The proteins were expressed in
BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells as previously described1. Bacterial cultures were grown
to mid-log phase and induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 18 °C. The cultures were spun
down and resuspended in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM TCEP, pH 8.0,
containing 1 mM AEBSF, 2.5 μg ml–1 DNAse and cOmplete protease inhibitor tablets
(Roche). Cells were lysed with an EmulsiFlex C-5 homogenizer (Avestin), and the lysate
was cleared by centrifugation at 131,000×g for 45 min at 4 °C. The proteins were then
purified on a Ni2+ affinity resin column (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare). The hexa-histidine
tag was removed by TEV cleavage overnight at 4 °C. The CNBHD was further purified by
anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q HP, GE Healthcare) after 10-fold dilution with
buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 8.0. The protein eluted with a shallow
linear NaCl gradient as one well-separated peak. The TEV digested eag domain was
concentrated and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) with
buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8. Both proteins were
concentrated to about 475 μM using 10 kD MWCO concentrators (Millipore), flash-frozen
in liquid N2 and store at -80°C until use. Fluorescein labeling of the endogenous cysteines of
the eag domain (FL-eag) was done as previously described2. Briefly, TEV digested, gel
filtered purified protein was incubated with 100 μM fluorescein-5-maleimide (Invitrogen)

for 1 hour at room temperature, in the above gel filtration buffer, without DTT. The labeled
protein was separated from unincorporated dye by gel filtration and concentrated to 50 μM.
FSEC3 and fluorescence anisotropy
For FSEC experiments, FL-eag was mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio with purified CNBHD and
the mixture was loaded on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) mounted on
an HPLC system (Shimadzu) with a fluorescence detector set for detection of fluorescein
fluorescence. Fluorescence anisotropy was recorded using a Fluorolog 3 spectrophotometer
(HORIBA, Jobin Yvon). 100 nM FL-eag was placed in a quartz cuvette, and anisotropy was
measured with increasing concentrations of CNBHD. Anisotropy experiments with 492 nm
excitation and 514 nm emission were performed as previously described4. To estimate
binding affinity, plots of the anisotropy versus total CNBHD concentration were fit using
the following first-order reaction scheme:

Crystallization and structure determination

Author Manuscript

Crystals of the eag domain-CNBHD complex were grown at 20°C using sitting-drop vapor
diffusion by mixing a 2:1 ratio (Mosquito, TTP LABTECH) of protein mixture and a
reservoir solution, containing 18% (w/v) PEG 3350, 1.8% (v/v) Tacsimate, 10 mM MnCl2
and 90 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. This condition produced crystals within 3 days, which grow to
maximum size of about 300 μm × 80 μm × 80 μm after 21 days. For diffraction data
collection, crystals were immersed in liquid nitrogen after cryoprotection in 20% glycerol.
Data were collected at 110 °K on beamline 8.2.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley). Integration, scaling and merging of the diffraction
data were done with the Mosflm program5. The crystals belonged to space group P65 and
the unit cell had dimensions of a = b = 162.38 Å and c = 100.44 Å with α = β = 90° and γ =
120°. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the programs Phaser6 and
Phenix7 with the mEAG1 CNBHD (PDB accession 4F8A) as the search model. Data
collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supplementary Table 1. Each
asymmetric unit contained eight protein subunits forming four eag domain-CNBHD
complexes. Electron density was visible for most of the protein chains except for a few
disordered terminal residues and the initial 10 and 23 residues of the eag domains of ‘type I’
and ‘type II’ dimers, respectively. Iterative model building and refinement were carried out
in Phenix with manual adjustments using COOT8. The final model was refined to a

Electrophysiology

Author Manuscript

The cDNA encoding the mEAG1 channel in the pGH19 vector was kindly provided by G.
Robertson (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI). The cRNA was transcribed
using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion). Xenopus laevis oocytes were defolliculated and
injected with the cRNA as previously described9. Following manual removal of the vitelline
membrane, currents were recorded in the inside-out patch configuration10 with an EPC-10
patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate
glass and had resistances of 0.4 – 0.8 MΩ after fire polishing. The intracellular (bath) and
extracellular (pipette) solutions contained 130 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA,
pH 7.2. For the experiments examining the eag domain-CNBHD salt bridge (with the R57D,
D642R mutations) the mEAG1 currents were elicited by applying a series of 1-2 s test
pulses to voltages ranging from -120 to +50 mV in 10 mV increments from a holding
potential of -100 mV, followed by a 0.5 s voltage pulse to -90 mV. For experiments
examining an interaction between the PAS-cap and CNBHD (with mutations in residues R7R8 and E627), the mEAG1 currents were elicited by a series of 50 ms test pulses to voltages
ranging from -140 mV to +200 mV in 10 mV increments, from a holding potential of -100
mV, following by a 200 ms voltage pulse to -100 mV. Currents were not leak subtracted.
Data were acquired with Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik) and analyzed with Igor
(WaveMetrics, Inc).

To measure the conductance-voltage relationships for all electrophysiology experiments,
peak tail current amplitudes at -90 or -100 mV, were normalized to the largest peak
conductance amplitude. Plots of the normalized conductance versus the test voltage were fit
with a Boltzmann function:

Where V represents the test voltage (mV), V0.5 is the midpoint activation voltage (mV), and
s is the slope of the relation (mV).
