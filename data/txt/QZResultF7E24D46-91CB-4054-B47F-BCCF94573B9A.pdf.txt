Abstract

Author Manuscript

Dietary restriction (DR) delays the incidence and decreases the growth of various types of
tumours, but the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of tumours to food restriction remain
unknown. We find that certain human cancer cell lines, when grown as tumour xenografts in mice,
are highly sensitive to the anti-growth effects of DR, while others are resistant. Cancer cells that
form DR-resistant tumours carry mutations that cause constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway
and in culture proliferate in the absence of insulin or IGF1. Substitution of an activated mutant
allele of PI3K with wild-type PI3K in otherwise isogenic cancer cells, or the restoration of PTEN
expression in a PTEN-null cancer cell line, is sufficient to convert a DR-resistant tumour into one
that is DR-sensitive. DR does not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer, but
significantly decreases tumour burden in a mouse model of lung cancer lacking constitutive PI3K
signaling. Thus, the PI3K pathway is a major determinant of the sensitivity of tumours to DR and
activating mutations in the pathway may influence the response of cancers to DR-mimetic
therapies.

The life-prolonging anti-tumorigenic effects of dietary restriction (DR) were first described
in the beginning of the twentieth century1–3. To date, reports indicate that the incidence as
well as growth rates of various types of tumours are reduced in laboratory rodents

undergoing DR, the latter being achieved through a 10 to 50% decrease in caloric intake4–
11. Interestingly, the effects of DR are not uniform, with tumours from different tissues
responding to restriction to different degrees, and a fraction of tumours originating in the
same tissues being resistant to DR4,7,10–14.

Author Manuscript

A consistent response of animals to DR is a reduction in the levels of circulating factors
influencing cellular and organismal growth, notably insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1)8,11,12,15,16. Despite the common systemic changes that accompany DR and its
general anti-tumorigenic effects, the question of whether all tumours, under similar
experimental conditions, respond equally to DR remains unanswered. Here, we investigate
the responsiveness of different types of human and mouse tumours to DR. We identify the
activation status of the PI3K pathway as a molecular signature that largely predicts the
sensitivity of a tumour to DR and show that by modulating PI3K activation we can convert a
DR-resistant tumour into one that is DR-sensitive.

Differential sensitivities of tumour xenografts to DR

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate the responsiveness of different types of tumours to DR, we injected six
established human cancer cell lines derived from the brain (U87-MG), colon (SW620),
prostate (PC3) and breast (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MCF10DCIS.com17, hereafter
MCF10DCIS) subcutaneously into NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic, severe combined
immunodeficient) mice. MDA-MB-231 and MCF10DCIS cells were also injected
orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of the mice. Xenograft-bearing mice were then fed
ad-libitum a standard rodent diet for 3–4 days (20 days in the case of U87-MG and
orthotopic MDA-MB-231), after which they were subdivided into AL (ad-libitum-fed) or
DR (dietary-restricted) groups for two to three weeks. All DR mice received daily meals
amounting to 60% of the caloric intake of their AL counterparts (i.e., 40% DR), and
underwent similar decreases in body weight (20–30%) at the end of the restriction period
(Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). In contrast, the tumours formed displayed differential
sensitivities to DR and could be classified into two main categories: DR-sensitive tumours,
which showed significant decreases in tumour volume (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231 and
SW620) and DR-resistant tumours, that grew to similar sizes in AL and DR mice (PC3,
U87-MG and MCF10DCIS) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1g). As with their
subcutaneous counterparts, DR caused a significant reduction in the volume of
orthotopically generated MDA-MB-231 tumour xenografts, whereas MCF10DCIS tumours
were completely resistant to DR (Fig. 1b). Consistent with earlier reports15,16, in response
to DR all mice experienced notable decreases in plasma levels of insulin and IGF-1
(Supplementary Fig. 1c–f). These findings suggest that factors other than systemic changes
in the host underlie the differential sensitivities of the tumour xenografts to DR.

Constitutive PI3K signaling in DR-resistant tumours
Because the xenografted tumours responded differentially to DR despite similar decreases in
insulin and IGF-1 levels, we determined whether the six cancer cell lines studied have
differential requirements for these factors for their growth in tissue culture. Indeed, in cell
lines that form DR-sensitive tumours (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and SW620) insulin

or IGF-1 caused a dose-dependent increase in cell numbers (Fig. 2a). In contrast, cell lines
that generate DR-resistant tumours (MCF10DCIS, U87-MG, PC3) grew in culture in an
insulin and IGF-1-independent fashion (Fig. 2b).

Author Manuscript

These results suggested that the cancer cell lines forming DR-resistant tumours have a
deregulation in an insulin/IGF-1activated signaling pathway, with the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway18 being an attractive candidate. Acting through receptor
tyrosine kinases, insulin and IGF-1 recruit PI3K to the cell membrane19, where its activity,
which is antagonized by the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on
chromosome 10) tumour suppressor, leads to the recruitment and activation of Akt, a serine/
threonine kinase. In turn, Akt phosphorylates and regulates numerous targets that enhance
cellular growth and inhibit apoptosis. Consistent with a deregulation in PI3K signaling in
cell lines that form DR-resistant tumours, serum withdrawal for 1 or 24 hours did not affect
Akt S473 phosphorylation, a marker of Akt activation, in MCF10DCIS, PC3, and U87-MG
cells but did in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and SW620 cells (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

Analysis of PTEN expression showed that PTEN loss could account for the seruminsensitive Akt activity20 in PC3 and U87-MG, but not, MCF10DCIS cells (Fig. 2d).
Activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3K, also
lead to constitutive Akt activity in cancer cells21–24. By sequencing in all the cell lines
exons 9 and 20 of PI3KCA that can be the sites of the “hot-spot” E545K and H1047R
mutations21,25, respectively, we found that the MCF10DCIS cells harbor a previously
unknown H1047R mutation. None of the cell lines that form DR-sensitive tumors have lost
PTEN function or carry PI3K activating mutations26 (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, no other
common oncogene-activating (e.g. RAS, BRAF) or tumour suppressor-inactivating (e.g.
TP53) mutation correlated with tumour cell sensitivity to insulin/IGF-1 in vitro or tumour
sensitivity to DR in vivo26 (Fig. 2e). Although PI3K can be directly activated by ras27 and
this is necessary for the initiation of ras-driven tumours28, the MDA-MB-231 and SW620
cell lines carrying activated RAS alleles form DR-sensitive tumors (Fig. 2e). These results
imply that tumour resistance to DR correlates with constitutive activation (e.g. through
PIK3CA mutations or PTEN loss), rather than hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway.

DR increases apoptosis in DR-sensitive tumours

Author Manuscript

While phospho-S473 Akt could not be detected in DR-sensitive tumours by
immunohistochemistry, it was readily detected in DR-resistant tumours and its levels did not
decrease upon DR (data not shown). Thus, to assay for changes in PI3K signaling in DRsensitive tumours upon restriction, we examined the FOXO1 transcription factor, a major
downstream target of Akt that is selectively phosphorylated as a result of PI3K activation21.
Phosphorylation of FOXO1 by Akt leads to its cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation so
that a decrease in Akt signaling causes relocalization of FOXO1 to the nucleus, where it
induces transcription of pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative genes29. In the DR-resistant
(PC3 and MCF10DCIS) tumours, FOXO1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of
tumour cells in both AL and DR mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, DR caused a
significant re-localization of FOXO1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the cells of DR-

sensitive tumours (MDA-MB-435, SW620 and MDA-MB-231) (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b),
indicating that in these tumours DR inhibited PI3K signaling.

Author Manuscript

Suppression by DR of the growth of DR-sensitive tumours could be the result of enhanced
cellular death, decreased cellular proliferation, or both. To distinguish amongst these
possibilities, we measured the number of tumour cells that were proliferating or undergoing
apoptosis by assaying for Ki-67 and caspase-3 cleavage, respectively. Although DR tended
to decrease the number of Ki-67 positive cells in DR-sensitive but not DR-resistant tumours,
these effects did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). However, a common
apoptotic response to DR was observed in all DR-sensitive, but not -resistant tumour
xenografts (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d), correlating with the presence of nuclear FOXO1 in
DR-sensitive tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Indeed, whereas PC3 tumours maintained
low levels of apoptosis under ad-libitum or DR conditions, MDA-MB-435 tumours
increased cellular apoptotic rates by 5.6-fold (from 7% to 39%; p = 0.003) and SW620
tumours showed massive DR-induced apoptosis, which occurred at the edges of tumours
(21.3-fold increase, from 2% to 42.5%;) and also at their centers (2.9-fold increase, from
30.7% to 88.8%) averaging to a 3.6-fold increase (from 18.4% to 65.6%; p = 0.0003) in
whole tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2c). In orthotopic MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-231
xenografted tumours, no obvious apoptosis was noted following 12 days of DR (data not
shown). Nevertheless, when these tumours were harvested only 2 days following restriction,
a significant 6-fold increase in apoptosis was observed in MDA-MB-231 (1.1 to 6.6%; p =
0.05) but not in MCF10DCIS tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2d), indicating that in MDAMB-231 tumours, sensitivity to DR-induced apoptosis occurs at earlier stages of the
tumorigenic process. Hence, these analyses show that decreased PI3K signaling in human
tumour xenografts correlates with DR-induced apoptosis.

Conversion of a DR-resistant tumour into one that is DR-sensitive
The correlation between tumour sensitivity to DR and the activation status of the PI3K
pathway led us to hypothesize that constitutive PI3K signaling in tumour cells is sufficient
to decrease the sensitivity of tumours to DR. To begin testing this idea, we used two cell
lines derived from the DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line21. These cells are isogenic except
that one carries a wild-type (DLD-WT) and the other (DLD-Mut) a constitutively active
mutant allele (E545K) of PIK3CA. Consistent with their genetic statuses, DLD-Mut but not
DLD-WT cells maintained high levels of phospho-S473 Akt upon serum withdrawal for 1 or
24 hours (Fig. 3a). The growth responses of the DLD-Mut and DLD-WT cells in culture to
increasing concentrations of insulin or IGF-1 (Fig. 3b, c) were reminiscent of those of the
cancer lines that form DR-resistant and DR-sensitive tumours, respectively (Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

In xenograft studies, subcutaneous injection in NOD/SCID mice of 0.6 × 106 DLD-WT or
0.25 × 106 DLD-Mut cells, yielded tumours of approximately equal volume in 18 days (Fig.
3d). Application of a 14-day DR regimen to xenografted mice 4 days following tumour cell
injection resulted in DLD-WT tumours that were 2.7-fold smaller in volume than those in
AL mice (Fig. 3d). Although DLD-Mut tumours grew at a faster rate than DLD-WT
tumours, they showed no significant decrease in tumour size upon DR (Fig. 3d). Analysis of
FOXO1 in the DLD1 tumours showed significant re-localization of FOXO1 from the

cytoplasm to the nucleus in the DLD-WT tumour cells upon DR (Fig. 4a). FOXO1 remained
cytoplasmic in DLD-Mut cells regardless of restriction (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, DLD-WT but
not DLD-Mut tumours had a significant enhancement in caspase-3 cleavage (12.5-fold)
upon the 14-day DR period (Fig. 4c). Thus, the presence of a PI3K activating mutation in an
otherwise DR-sensitive tumour cell line is sufficient to protect tumours formed by these
cells from the anti-growth and pro-apoptotic effects of DR.

Author Manuscript

Because PTEN loss also leads to aberrant PI3K activation20, we investigated the role of
PTEN in determining tumour sensitivity to DR. We made use of a PTEN-null cell line (U87MG) that was engineered to induce PTEN expression upon addition of doxycycline30. In
culture in vitro, doxycycline-induced PTEN expression caused a decrease in phospho-S473
Akt levels in U87-MG cells (Fig. 3e, left panel) and was sufficient to transform the seruminsensitive U87-MG cells (see Fig. 2c) into serum-sensitive cells that responded to serum
withdrawal by decreasing levels of phospho-S473Akt (Fig. 3e, right panel). In contrast to
PTEN-null U87-MG cells (Fig. 2b), PTEN-expressing U87-MG cells increased their net
growth rates in response to increasing levels of insulin and IGF-1 (Fig. 3f).

Author Manuscript

In vivo doxycycline administration induced PTEN expression in tumour xenografts formed
from U87-MG cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). As expected from restoring the expression
of a tumour suppressor, the growth rate of U87-MG tumours decreased significantly in the
presence of doxycycline, regardless of diet. Nevertheless, the re-expression of PTEN was
sufficient to switch the response of U87-MG tumours from being resistant to DR (Fig. 1a
and Fig. 3g, left panel) to one that is DR-sensitive (Fig. 3g, right panel). Upon DR, the
number of Ki-67 positive cells tended to decrease (by 15%) in PTEN-expressing U87-MG
tumours, without, however, reaching statistical significance (data not shown). In the absence
of PTEN, FOXO1 was mostly sequestered in the cytoplasm of U87-MG tumour cells in AL
as well as DR mice (Fig. 4b). However, upon DR of mice bearing PTEN-expressing U87MG tumours, FOXO1 re-localized to the nucleus of tumour cells (Fig. 4b), and this
correlated with enhanced apoptosis (Fig. 4d), consistent with results obtained for all DRsensitive tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). Therefore, restoration of PTEN
expression in a DR-resistant, PTEN-null cancer cell line is sufficient to convert it to a cell
line that forms DR-sensitive tumour xenografts in vivo.

FOXO1 overexpression sensitizes tumours to DR

Author Manuscript

To investigate the effects of the FOXO factors on the response of tumours to DR, we
overexpressed FOXO1 in SW620 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and analyzed the sensitivity
to DR of the corresponding tumour xenografts compared to control tumours expressing
green fluorescent protein (GFP). A cell line that forms DR-sensitive rather than DR-resistant
tumours was used because FOXO1 function is unlikely to be regulated by DR in cancer cells
where Akt is constitutively active. FOXO1 overexpression in SW620 xenograft tumours
slightly slowed tumour growth (30% decrease) in the AL feeding condition, likely due to
aberrant entry of exogenous FOXO1 into the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Importantly,
in tumours overexpressing FOXO1, DR caused a greater fold reduction in tumour volume
(4.1-fold) than in tumours expressing GFP (2.3-fold) (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
Immunohistochemical analyses showed that upon DR, FOXO1 localized to the nucleus in

FOXO1-overexpressing as well as control tumours (Supplementary Fig. 4c), particularly in
areas that coincided with enhanced caspase-3 cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Under AL
conditions the number of apoptotic cells was slightly enhanced in FOXO1-overexpressing
tumours compared to the control tumours. However, the DR-induced apoptotic response
increased to a larger extent upon DR in FOXO1-overexpressing tumours than in control
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 4d). No significant changes in proliferation were detected
among the different tumours (data not shown). These findings are consistent with FOXO1
playing a key role in the anti-tumour effects of DR, but do not preclude the involvement of
other PI3K effectors, including other FOXO family members.

A PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer is resistant to DR

Author Manuscript

We next examined the effects of DR in two engineered mouse models of cancer. The first
model (Probasin-Cre; PTEN L/L) is driven by PTEN loss in the prostate and recapitulates
human prostate cancer progression31. The second (K-RASLA2; P53 LSL/ WT) is driven by
K-ras activation as well as p53 heterozygosity and leads to the development of lung
adenocarcinoma32,33. Compared to the AL condition, DR significantly reduced the size of
tumour nodules (42% decrease) in the lungs of 7 week-old K-RASLA2; P53 LSL/ WT mice
(Fig. 5a). Although the lung tumours were of similar pathological grade under both the AL
feeding and DR (Fig. 5b), DR strongly decreased the number of proliferating tumour cells
(4-fold; 12.5% to 3.1%; p = 8 × 10−8) without affecting the rates of apoptosis (Fig. 5c, d).

Author Manuscript

In the prostates of 11 week-old Probasin-Cre; PTEN L/L mice, DR did not have any
detectable effect on the extent or histological appearance of the prostate intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) (Fig. 5e) or on the activation levels of Akt (Fig. 5f). Indeed, neither the
proliferative, nor apoptotic indices of the PIN were affected by DR (Fig. 5g, h). Similar
results were obtained in the prostates of 7–8 week-old Probasin-Cre; PTEN L/L mice given
the same DR regimen (data not shown). Thus, consistent with the human tumour xenograft
studies, engineered mouse tumours without mutations that confer constitutive PI3K
signaling appear to be DR-sensitive while those with such mutations are DR-resistant.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Dietary restriction (DR) has long been known to suppress tumour growth in laboratory
rodents10. We find that genetic alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN can predict the response of
tumours to DR, classifying them into DR-sensitive and DR-resistant tumours. Our results
suggest that differential levels of PI3K activation in tumours contribute to their differential
sensitivities to DR. It is important to note that we have studied the effects of relatively shortterm DR on the growth of tumours at early stages of the tumorigenic process. Thus, at more
advanced tumour stages, signaling pathways other than PI3K may play key roles in
mediating the effects of DR.
It is interesting to consider which of the downstream effectors of PI3K may mediate the
responses of tumours to DR that we have observed. Attractive candidates are the FOXO
family of transcription factors that regulate proliferation and apoptosis. Reminiscent of the
cell type- and tissue microenvironment-dependent effects of the FOXO factors on

proliferation and apoptosis34, we find that DR causes strong suppression of proliferation in
the engineered mouse lung cancer model, while having a prominent pro-apoptotic effect in
the human tumour xenograft models. Upon DR, FOXO moves from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus only in the cells of DR-sensitive tumours and overexpression of FOXO sensitizes
tumours to the anti-growth effects of DR. These results suggest an important role for the
FOXO factors but do not exclude potential roles for other PI3K effectors. The activity of
signaling molecules that interact at multiple levels with the PI3K pathway, such as mTOR,
AMPK, and SIRT1, are likely to fine-tune the sensitivities of tumours to DR (see
Supplementary Discussion).

Author Manuscript

Our findings are consistent with the effects of DR on the growth of early tumours being the
result of both systemic changes in the host and signaling events intrinsic to the tumour.
These findings should allow for the prediction of the responsiveness of a specific tumour to
DR, based on a readily measurable molecular signature, namely the activation status of the
PI3K pathway in the tumour cells.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cell lines were obtained from the Karmanos Cancer Institute (MCF10DCIS.com), B.
Vogelstein (DLD-WT and DLD-Mut), M. M. Georgescu (U87-MG) and ATCC (all others)
and grown under conditions described by the providers. SW620 cell lines stably
overexpressing human FOXO1 or GFP were generated by infection with lentiviruses
expressing the corresponding cDNA. Cellular proliferation was measured using the XTT kit
(Roche). For immunoblotting, protein lysates were probed with Phospho-S473 Akt, Akt or
PTEN antibodies (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies). Immunohistochemistry detection
of PTEN, FOXO1 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies (1:100, Cell Signaling Technologies)
was performed on paraffin-embedded, sliced tumour sections according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. PI3K mutations E545K and H1047R were detected by sequencing
of two PIK3CA fragments amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from each cell
line. All animal studies and procedures were approved by the MIT Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Mouse xenografts were generated by injecting tumour cells
subcutaneously into male (female for breast cancer cell lines) or orthotopically in the fat
pads of female NOD/SCID mice. Five-week-old K-RASLA2; P53 Lox/Stop/Lox (LSL)/ WT
mice, obtained from the Jacks laboratory32,33 and five-week-old as well as 9-week-old
Probasin-Cre; PTEN Lox/Lox (L/L) 31 mice were used in the DR studies. DR was achieved
by providing individually caged mice a daily portion of a chow diet fortified with vitamins
and minerals amounting to 60% of the daily food intake of their ad-libitum-fed counterparts.
Mice were euthanized at the beginning of the light cycle, following retro-orbital blood
withdrawal. Tumours were harvested, measured and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed
in formalin. Plasma insulin and IGF-1 levels were determined by ELISA (CrystalChem and
Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, respectively). Data are presented as means ± s.e.m., and
significant P values (≤ 0.05) were obtained by performing non-paired, two-tailed Student’s t
tests to compare two groups.

METHODS
Cell lines
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, PC3 and SW620 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. SW620 cell lines stably overexpressing
human FOXO1 or GFP were generated by infection with lentiviruses expressing the
corresponding cDNA and selected for puromycin resistance (2µg/ml) for 7 days prior to
injection into mice. MCF10DCIS.com cell lines were from the Karmanos Cancer Institute
and grown in DMEM/F12 with 5% horse serum. The isogenic cell lines DLD-WT and DLDMut were from B. Vogelstein and cultured as described21. The doxycycline-inducible U87MG cell lines were provided by M. M. Georgescu and maintained as described30.
Proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

On day 0, cell lines were seeded in their appropriate media in four 96-well plates each, at a
density of 3000 (DLD-WT, DLD-Mut and SW620), 5000 (MCF10DCIS, PC3) or 7500
(MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and U87-MG) cells/well and all plates were incubated
overnight. On day 1, three assay plates (for days 3, 5 and 7) of each cell line were washed
once with DMEM in the absence of serum and their media were replaced with DMEM
supplemented with 0.1% FBS only or with 0.1% FBS and 12 different concentrations of
insulin (1, 10, 50, 100, 1000 and 10,000 ng/ml) or IGF-1 (0.5, 5, 25, 50, 100 and 500 ng/ml).
Six wells per media condition were used in each plate. The fourth plate from each cell line
was used as a baseline day 1 measurement of cell number without addition of the assay
media. The cell proliferation kit II (XTT, Roche) was used to measure cell number on days
1, 3, 5 and 7 of the assay.

Immunoblotting
Cells were rinsed once in ice-cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer containing 50mM
Hepes, pH 7.4, 40mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1.5mM orthovanadate, 50mM NaF, 10mM
pyrophosphate, 10mM glycerophosphate, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) and 1%
Triton-X-100. Tumour tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer supplemented with 1%
deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Proteins from total lysates were resolved by 8–12% SDSPAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described35 using antibodies for phospho-S473
Akt, Akt and PTEN (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology).
DNA sequencing

Author Manuscript

RNA was extracted and cDNA was prepared from all cell lines as previously described36.
Two fragments of the PIK3CA (NM_006218) were amplified by PCR that enclosed either
the E545K (nucleotide 1573–1996) or the H1047R (nucleotide 3213–3466) PI3K hot-spot
mutation21 using primer pairs PIK1-For/PIK3-Rev, or PIK5-For/PIK2-Rev, respectively.
PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C (PIK1For/PIK3-Rev) or 53 °C (PIK5-For/PIK2-Rev) for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s (PIK1-For/PIK3Rev) or 20 s (PIK5-For/PIK2-rev), followed by a final cycle of 68 °C for 10 min. The
(PIK1-For/PIK3-Rev) and (PIK5-For/PIK2-Rev) amplified fragments were then purified
and sequenced using PIK7-For and PIK2-Rev, respectively.

All animal studies and procedures were approved by the MIT Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Six- to eight-week-old NOD/SCID mice (from Jackson laboratory) were
used for generating all xenografts, with females for breast cancer and males for all other
cancer models. In subcutaneous xenografts, mice were injected at two sites in the dorsal
region, under isofluorane anesthesia with 100 µl / injection of tumour cell suspension in
Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) with 15% matrigel. In orthotopic
xenografts, mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, a ventral incision was made
in the skin and 25 µl of cell suspension in HBSS with 33% matrigel were injected into the
fourth pair of inguinal fat pads. Matrigel used in all experiments was phenol red-free and
growth factor-reduced (BD Biosciences). Appropriate tumour cell numbers were injected
depending on the tumour growth rates in vivo. For subcutaneous tumours xenografts: 0.25 ×
106 cells for DLD-Mut, 0.5 × 106 for PC3; 0.6 × 106 for DLD-WT; 1 × 106 for

Dietary Restriction (DR)

Author Manuscript

For a period of 3–4 days (20 days for U87-MG and orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenografts)
following injection of tumour cells, all mice were fed an ad-libitum (AL) irradiated rodent
chow diet (Prolab RMH 3000, 5P00) providing 3.46 kcal/g physiological fuel value, 26% of
which is from protein, 14% from fat and 60% from carbohydrates. All mice were then
individually caged and subdivided into an AL group and a 40% DR group. Weekly body
weights and daily AL food intake were recorded. Restricted mice received a daily afternoon
meal of a DR diet that amounted to 60% of the daily food intake of their AL counterparts.
The DR diet has similar consistency to the AL diet except that it is fortified with vitamins
and minerals (LabDiet, 5B6V) so as to prevent deficiency in these nutrients in the restricted
mice. For U87-MG xenografts, 0.2 mg/ml doxycycline was administered in the drinking
water 3 days prior to food restriction and was then replenished three times a week
throughout the experiment. DR was carried for 12–15 days (24 days for subcutaneous
MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-231). Five-week-old K-RASLA2; P53 LSL /WT mice (obtained
from the Jacks laboratory)32,33 and 9-week-old as well as five-week old Probasin-Cre;
PTEN L/L31 mice of mixed background were used in the DR studies.

Necropsy and plasma analyses

Author Manuscript

Mice were euthanized at the beginning of the light cycle following retro-orbital blood
withdrawal and plasma was prepared as described36. Plasma insulin and IGF-1were assayed
using kits from CrystalChem and Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, respectively. Tumours
were harvested, their dimensions (termed a, b and c) were measured with a caliper and
tumour volume estimated according to the ellipsoid formula: 4/3 × π × (a/2 × b/2 × c/2)37.
Tumours were then either immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in formalin for later
processing.
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Formalin-fixed tumours were embedded in paraffin and sections were immunostained
according to the manufacturer’s protocol using PTEN (1:100), FOXO1 (1:50) or cleaved
caspase-3 (1:100) antibodies, (Cell Signaling Technology). The latter staining was
performed using an automated stainer in the Histology Core Laboratory at MIT.
Quantification analysis was accomplished by measuring the ratios of cleaved caspase-3stained cells (visual count) over hematoxylin-stained cells (automated count using
CellProfiler program38,39) in an average of 9 pictures of 3 different tumours (1000 nuclei/
picture) for each particular xenograft/diet condition.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as means ± s.e.m. In comparing two groups, two-tailed non-paired
Student’s t test was performed and P ≤ 0.05 (unless otherwise stated) was considered
significant.
