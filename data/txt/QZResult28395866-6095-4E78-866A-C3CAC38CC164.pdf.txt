ABSTRACT
Most chemotherapeutic drugs exert their anti-tumor effects primarily by
triggering a final pathway leading to apoptosis. Noninvasive imaging of apoptotic
events in preclinical models would greatly facilitate the development of apoptosisinducing compounds and evaluation of their therapeutic efficacy. Here we employed a
cyclic firefly luciferase (cFluc) reporter to screen potential pro-apoptotic compounds
from a number of natural agents. We demonstrated that sanguinarine (SANG) could
induce apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in UM-SCC-22B head and neck
cancer cells. Moreover, SANG-induced apoptosis was associated with the generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)
and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signal pathways. After intravenous administration
with SANG in 22B-cFluc xenograft models, a dramatic increase of luminescence
signal can be detected as early as 48 h post-treatment, as revealed by longitudinal
bioluminescence imaging in vivo. Remarkable apoptotic cells reflected from ex vivo
TUNEL staining confirmed the imaging results. Importantly, SANG treatment caused
distinct tumor growth retardation in mice compared with the vehicle-treated group.
Taken together, our results showed that SANG is a candidate anti-tumor drug and
noninvasive imaging of apoptosis using cFluc reporter could provide a valuable tool
for drug development and therapeutic efficacy evaluation.

V [10, 11] or TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) [12] assays, have been widely employed to
detect apoptosis progress by taking advantage of the
characteristic biochemical changes occurring in apoptosis.
However, these methods usually require lysing or fixing of
cells. Importantly, they have serious shortcomings in their
inabilities to discriminate necrotic from apoptotic cells,
resulting in the failure of truly reflecting the intrinsically
complex apoptotic process [13–15]. Moreover, the
internucleosomal fragmentation is not always associated
with histologic evidence of apoptosis [16, 17]. Therefore,
to overcome these limitations, noninvasively real-time
monitoring apoptosis in living organisms would be a great
advance for better understanding of apoptotic process,

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is central to
regulate normal cell growth and development in all multicellular organism [1, 2]. The dysregulation of apoptosis
could ultimately result in a variety of disorders, including
autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and
tumors [3, 4]. Thus, stimulating tumor cell apoptosis is
a potential strategy for cancer drug discovery and anticancer therapy [5, 6]. In fact, a number of natural agents
have been shown to exert their anti-tumor effects via a
variety of apoptosis-inducing mechanisms in cancer cells
[7–9]. Several conventional approaches, such as Annexin

rapid screening of apoptosis-related drugs and early
evaluation of drug therapeutic efficiency [18].
To date, various imaging probes have been
developed to noninvasively monitor apoptosis using
different modality imaging techniques, including optical
imaging, radionuclide imaging, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and multiple-modality techniques
[19–21]. Most of the apoptosis probes were based on a
peptide sequence, DEVD (aspartic acid-glutamic acidvaline-aspartic acid), which can be specifically recognized
and cleaved by the apoptotic effector caspase-3 [22–27].
Caspase-3, one of the intracellular cysteine proteases, has
been identified as a pivotal mediator in the initiation and
propagation of apoptosis [28, 29]. However, due to the
low sensitivity, some of these probes are not well suitable
for real-time visualization of caspase-3 activation and
screening the candidate drugs for dysregulated apoptosis
in vivo. Recently Kanno A et al. and our group have
developed two novel apoptosis reporter probes, cyclic
firefly luciferase (cFluc) [30, 31] and cyclic HSV1-TK
(cTK) [32, 33], by fusing two fragments of DnaE inteins
to neighboring ends of luciferase or TK connected with
DEVD. Upon cells undergoing apoptosis stimulated
by exogenous drugs, caspase-3 is activated and cleaves
the genetically encoded cFluc or cTK, leading to the
restoration of luciferase or thymidine kinase activity that
can be detected in living organisms by bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) or positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging. The response of cFluc or cTK upon caspase-3
activation was extremely quick, suggesting a robust
tool for screening candidate compounds and monitoring
the dynamics of apoptotic process triggered by these
compounds.
In this study, given the easier manipulation and low
cost of BLI, we employed cFluc reporter probe to screen
potential apoptosis-inducing compounds from a number
of natural agents. We showed that sanguinarine (SANG),
a benzophenanthridine alkaloid derived from the root
of Sanguinaria Canadensis, could stimulate apoptosis
via activating the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in head and neck tumor cells and animal models. To
our best knowledge, it is the first study to noninvasively
monitor SANG-induced apoptosis process in vivo with
BLI techniques. Our data showed the potential of cFluc
reporter probe as a valuable tool for high-throughput
drug screening and anti-tumor therapeutic evaluation in
preclinical models.

cell line UM-SCC-22B. Upon cells undergoing apoptosis
stimulated by extrinsic drugs, caspase-3 would specifically
cleave the cyclic luciferase and result in the recovery of
luciferase activity that can be detected in animals by BLI
techniques (Figure 1). To validate the stable cell line,
we treated 22B-cFluc cells with doxorubicin (DOX), an
effective apoptosis inducer [34]. As expected, the DOX
treated cells resulted in significant increase of luciferase
signal compared with blank or DMSO treated groups,
confirming that cFluc is an effective reporter for sensing
cell apoptosis (Figure 2A).
To identify natural agents that induce cell apoptosis,
22B-cFluc cells were treated with 14 different natural
agents for 24 h, and the luciferase activities were then
measured. As shown in Figure 2B, one of the drugs,
SANG, induced the most fold increase of luciferase
intensity compared with DMSO treated group, suggesting
SANG has the potential to induce cell apoptosis.

Effects of SANG on cell viability and apoptosis
induction
To determine the effects of SANG on cell
viability, 22B-cFluc cells were stimulated with different
concentrations of SANG for 24 h, and then a CKK-8 assay
was performed. As shown in Figure 3A, the treatment
with SANG decreased the proliferation of 22B cells in a
dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we carried out further
experiments to investigate whether the inhibitory effect
of SANG on cell viability was due to apoptosis. First,
western blotting assay (Figure 3B) showed that SANG
treatment activated the expression of caspase-3, which
is believed to be a central effector for the initiation and
propagation of apoptosis [35]. Second, flow cytometry
analysis demonstrated that the percentage of Annexin
V-positive cells increased according to the concentration
increase of SANG used in cells (Figure 3C). Taken
together, these data suggest that SANG induces apoptosis
in 22B cancer cells.

In vitro real-time monitoring SANG-induced
apoptosis
To further explore the usefulness of cFluc reporter
in detecting apoptosis induced by SANG, 22B-cFluc
cells were treated with different amounts of SANG. As
shown in Figure 4A, an increase in luciferase activity
with increasing concentration of SANG was observed.
Meanwhile, the cytosolic extracts of 22B-cFluc cells
treated with different dose of SANG were measured
to detect cellular caspase-3 activity using Ac-DEVDpNA, which is a validated caspase-3 substrate [36]. It
is observed that the absorbance at 450 nm increased in a
dose-dependent manner, indicating increased caspase-3
activity stimulated by SANG (Figure 4B). In view of
the positive correlation between luciferase intensity and

To further investigate the efficacy of cFluc
reporter in monitoring apoptosis in real-time, 22B-cFluc
cells were treated with different concentrations of

SANG. After exposure to indicated concentration of
SANG for 4 h, the cells were washed and replaced with

cells was consistently increased and then decreased at
40 h. In contrast, the signal from 2 μM SANG treated
cells reached a peak at 30 h and then began to decrease
at later time point. Compared to 0.5 or 2 μM SANG
treated cells, the 4 μM SANG treated group showed
consistent increase of luciferase intensity with time

and reached the maximum at 24 h, then decreased
afterwards. The different apoptosis kinetics induced
by different concentration of SANG may be attributed
to the fact that the cells are more sensitive to a higher
concentration of SANG, resulting in achieving the peak
of luciferase activity at an earlier time point.

Generation of ROS is involved in SANG-induced
apoptosis

inhibition of caspase-3 activity (Figure 5D). Taken
together, these data suggest that ROS production is
involved in SANG-induced cell apoptosis.

It is suggested that the intracellular ROS generation
may be correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction and
apoptosis induction in various cell types [37]. To explore
whether the SANG-induced apoptosis was associated
with ROS, we therefore measured the intracellular ROS
production with the DCFH-DA fluorescence dye. As
shown in Figure 5A, the ROS production increased with
the increased concentration of SANG used in 22B cells.
However, prior treatment of the cells with a well-known
ROS antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), greatly
blocked the generation of ROS in the 4 μM SANG
treated 22B cells, and the blockage was time-dependent
(Figure 5B).
To further investigate whether SANG-induced
ROS generation was involved in apoptosis induction,
the cells were pretreated with different dose of NAC
and then co-incubated with SANG for further 24 h.
As shown in Figure 5C, blocking the ROS production
by NAC prevented the SANG-induced apoptosis,
reflected by the dose-dependent decreased of luciferase
activity. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of NAC on
the generation of ROS was correlated to a significant

SANG-induced apoptosis is associated with the
activation of JNK and NF-κB signal pathways
It is reported that the activation of cell signaling
pathways, such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK) or P38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (p38 MAPK), is involved in the regulation of cell
growth and cell death [38, 39]. Thus, to examine whether
these signal pathways were activated during SANGinduced apoptosis process, the cells were pretreated with
BAY11-7082, SP600125 or SB203850, which are specific
inhibitors of NF-κB, JNK or p38 MAPK signal pathways,
respectively. The cells were then co-incubated with SANG
for another 24 h. As shown in Figure 6A, the pretreatment
with BAY11-7082 or SP600125 significantly attenuated
the SANG-induced apoptosis, evidencing by the inhibition
of luciferase activity. In contrast, SB203850 had little
effect on the luciferase signal change comparing with the
cells treated with SANG alone. These results indicated
that NF-κB and JNK pathways were activated during the
apoptosis induced by SANG.

Figure 5: ROS production was involved in SANG-induced apoptosis. A. The cells were treated with different concentrations

of SANG for 1 h, and then incubated with 10 mM DCFH-DA for 30 min. The ROS production in the cells was determined by measuring
the OD values at excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/525 nm with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. B. The cells were treated with 4
μM SANG for 1 h, or they were pretreated with 20 mM NAC for 1 h and further co-incubated with 4 μM SANG for the indicated times.

activity. Data presented as mean ± SD for the three independent experiments. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. control.

To further validate the involvement of NF-κB and
JNK in SANG-induced apoptosis, the protein expression
of IκBα and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) in cells treated
with SANG were determined using western blotting assay.
As shown in Figure 6B, stimulation of 22B cells with
SANG resulted in the remarkably increased expression of
p-JNK and IκBα, confirming that the activation of NF-κB
and JNK was participated in SANG-mediated apoptosis
in 22B cells.

observed throughout the course of experiment. At 72 h
after treatment, the tumors were collected and subjected
to TUNEL staining for evaluating apoptosis. Compared
with the control tumors, the group treated with SANG
exhibited significantly more cell apoptosis, indicated by
the increased green signals from the sporadic apoptotic
cells (Figure 7C).
To further explore the anti-tumor efficacy of SANG
in vivo, the 22B-cFluc tumor bearing mice were treated
intravenously with SANG at 10 mg/kg every other day
throughout the experimental periods. As reflected by the
tumor growth curve (Figure 8A), the treated mice showed
response to SANG after 3 days and exhibited significant
tumor growth retardation over time compared with
control mice. After three weeks of treatment, the tumor
burdens in SANG treated mice were reduced by 60%
in comparison with that in control group, indicating the
strong therapeutic efficacy of SANG. Note that there was
a little body weight loss observed in both groups at the
end of the experiment, which may be due to the toxicity
of DMSO solvent towards the animals (Figure 8B). Taken
together, these data confirm that SANG could efficiently
induce apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition in vivo.

In vivo real-time imaging of SANG-induced
apoptosis and therapeutic efficacy
To evaluate the apoptosis induced by SANG in
vivo, 22B-cFluc cells were inoculated subcutaneously
into one flank of nude mice and xenograft models were
allowed to establish. Mice were treated intravenously with
10 mg/kg of SANG. At 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment,
bioluminescent imaging was performed after i.p. injection
of mice with 150 mg/kg of D-luciferin substrate. As shown
in Figure 7A and 7B, SANG treatment induced an obvious
increase of luminescent signal as early as 48 h after
initial treatment. A sustained BLI intensity increased was

DISCUSSION

connecting with respective domain of luciferase [22, 23].
Comparing with these reporter probes, the cFluc or cTK
reporters showed high sensitivity and free background
noise during apoptosis [30, 32], which was also evidenced
by our in vitro cellular results and in vivo imaging results
in this study.
It is generally considered that apoptosis is a dynamic
and complicated process and altered treatment even by the
same drug in different tumor types may induce apoptosis
that are associated with different signal pathways. Choi
et al. [48] reported that the JNK pathway was activated in
a ROS-dependent manner within half an hour of SANG
treatment in human bladder cancer cells. However, a
specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, pretreatment did not
attenuate the apoptosis induced by SANG, suggesting
that ROS-dependent JNK activation cannot mediate the
SANG-induced apoptosis in bladder caner cells. In another
study [49], the same research group demonstrated that
treatment of human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells with
SANG led to activation of p38MAPK and JNK pathways,
but the disruption of these two pathways by specific
inhibitors did not significantly prevent SANG-induced
apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. In contrast, in the present
study we found that the phosphorylation of JNK and
increased expression of IκBα were detectable following
SANG treatment in 22B human head and neck cancer
cells. Furthermore, the pro-apoptotic effects induced by
SANG was extremely blocked by the pretreatment with
BAY11-7082 or SP610025 but not SB203850 inhibitor,
suggesting that activation of NF-κB and JNK signal
pathways were involved in SANG-inducing apoptosis in
22B cells. We speculate that the inconsistences among
these reports are attributed to the different tumor types
used.
With the cFluc reporter genetically modified
human head and neck cancer cells, we successfully
real-time assessed the dynamics of SANG-induced
apoptosis in a noninvasive manner. Although the
light absorption and scattering by mammalian tissues
largely limit the usefulness of BLI techniques in deep
tissues, it is indeed an ideal tool for high-throughput
drug screening in preclinical setting. Firstly, BLI is
relatively cost effective, simple and short acquisition
time needed. Furthermore, BLI enables longitudinal
monitoring of disease progression within the same
animal, which would provide assistances to evaluate
the optimal time intervals for imaging with other
techniques including PET. It is noteworthy that
although BLI have proved effective in preclinical trials,
it is yet to be fully validated as useful tool in clinical
applications. Radionuclide reporter probes such as cTK
are more promising for visualizing apoptosis and drug
response in a clinical setting [32, 33]. Our future work
will proceed towards the clinical translation of the
cTK probe for apoptosis-related drug development and
therapeutic evaluation.

It is believed that most chemotherapeutic agents
inhibit tumor progression mainly by inducing a final
pathway that leads to apoptosis, and resistance to antitumor treatment is widely thought to associate with
deregulation of cell proliferation that enable apoptosis
[40–42]. A few chemotherapeutic drugs, including
doxorubicin and paclitaxel, are generally considered
as active agents in a wide range of human tumors.
However, the treatments are usually abeyant due to
the drug resistance and intolerable toxicity [43, 44].
Therefore, there is a continuing need to explore novel
anti-tumor drugs for overcoming these limitations. Natural
products are an abundant source for cancer treatment. A
large number of plant-derived drugs possess significant
anticancer activities and have been increasingly used
in cancer chemotherapy [45]. In the present study, we
showed the utilization of cFluc reporter to screen proapoptotic natural compounds and to noninvasively monitor
the dynamics of apoptotic process induced by a natural
agent SANG in 22B head and neck tumor models. Our
data demonstrated that SANG stimulated cell apoptosis in
a dose- and time-dependent manner and the induction of
apoptosis is involved in the generation of ROS as well as
activation of JNK and NF-κB signal pathways.
The natural alkaloid SANG, derived from the root
of Sanguinaria Canadensis, has been shown to exhibit
potent anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities as
well as apoptosis-inducing activities in various cancer
cells [46]. However, most of the results were concluded
from in vitro cellular assays, which could not provide
the kinetic patterns of apoptosis process induced by
SANG. Molecular imaging enables noninvasively realtime visualization of cellular function and the subsequent
molecular process in living subjects. Accordingly,
noninvasive imaging of apoptosis would greatly aid in the
verification of experimental therapeutics for drug screen
and development [18]. Reporter genes have emerged as
powerful imaging tools that can reflect the progression of
a specific molecular event at the cellular level [47]. To
date, several luciferase- or radionuclide-based reporter
genes have been developed to visualize and quantify
apoptosis in a noninvasive manner [22–25, 30, 32]. These
reporter systems mainly concentrated on generating
cells that stably expressing a modified reporter protein
separated by a DEVD sequence, which is specifically
cleaved by the caspase-3 protease. In these models, signal
production occurs until the cells undergo apoptosis, at
which time BLI or PET imaging could capture the signals.
However, a drawback in these fusion protein reporters is
the relatively large molecular size that would reduce the
transfection or transduction efficiency into host cells [24,
25]. In addition, as is the case with those split luciferase
reporters, the luminescence signal may be diminished
due to the insufficient interaction between peptides that

Chemical drugs

The cells were harvested and were lysed in RIPA
lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) at room
temperature for 10 min. The supernatants were collected
and the protein concentrations were determined using a
BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China).
Equal amounts of protein extracts (20 μg) were loaded
in the SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5%
nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, the transferred
membranes were incubated with anti-caspase-3, antiJNK, anti-p-JNK, anti-IκBα or anti-actin primary
antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated
with the IgG-HRP secondary antibody for another 1 h.
The immunoreactivity was detected using ECL detecting
instrument (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp). The
primary and secondary antibodies were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
The protein bands were quantified using Image J software
and normalized to the signal intensity of actin.

The 14 natural drugs (Tubeimoside I, Betulinic acid,
Ursolic acid, Neohesperidin, Sophocarpine, Diosmetin,
Dioscin, Amygdalin, Oleanic acid, solanesol, Sparteine,
Sanguinarine, Sclareolide, Harmine) and doxorubicin were
purchased from Sigma. The signal pathway inhibitors
BAY11-7082, LY294002 and SB203850 were purchased
from Beyotime Biotechnology, China.

Cell lines and transfection
The UM-SCC-22B cells were purchased from Cell
Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China)
and maintained in DMEM medium, which supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamine, 100
mg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen,
CA). In order to establish the stable cell lines that express
the cyclic firefly luciferase (cFluc), cFluc plasmid [30]
was transfected into 22B cells with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacture’s protocols.
After 24 h, the cells were changed with selective medium
containing 800 mg/mL G418 ((Invitrogen, CA)) every
3 days until clones were formatted. The cell clones were then
picked up in 24-well plates and treated with doxorubicin.
The luciferase activity of the clones was determined using
luminometer (T20/20, Promega). The selective positive cell
clone was identified and named as 22B-cFluc.

Flow cytometry analysis
The apoptosis of cells induced by SANG was
detected using an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection
Kit (BD Pharmingen, MI) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Briefly, the cells were harvested and washed
twice with PBS. Then the cells were suspended in 1 ml
annexin-V binding buffer, which contains 140 mM NaCl,
10 mM HEPES/NaOH and 2.5 mM CaCl2. The cells were
incubated with Annexin V-FITC at room temperature for
15 min. PI (5 μg/ml) was added and the apoptotic cells
were analyzed with a Accuri C6 flow cytometer (C6, BD
Pharmingen, MI). The C Flow Plus software was used to
determine the relative DNA content.

Firefly luciferase assay
To validate the cyclic reporter, 22B-cFluc cells
were seeded at a density of 3 × 105/ml in a 24-well plate
and treated with doxorubicin. 24 h later, D-luciferin was
added in each well at a final concentration of 150 mg/
ml, the cells were then lysed and the luciferase activity
was measured using luminometer (T20/20, Promega).
In the other experiments, the 22B-cFluc cells were
treated with different concentration of SANG or 14
different types of drugs at the final concentration of
4 mM for each drug.

In vitro caspase-3 activity assay
The caspase-3 activity was measured using a
caspase-3 activity assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, the cells treated by different concentrations of
SANG (0.5 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM, 4 μM) or control DMSO
were collected, washed and lysed in a lysis buffer for
30 min on ice. The supernatants were then collected by
centrifuging at 1,2000 rpm for 10 min. The Ac-DEVDpNA (2 mM) was added to each sample and incubated at
37°C for 1 h. The optical density (OD) of each sample
was finally quantified at a wavelength of 405 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The p-NA standard
was used to calibrate the caspase-3 activity of each sample.

Cell viability assay
The cell viability of SANG was determined by
CCK-8 assay using a cell counting kit-8 (Beyotime
Biotechnology, China) according to the manufacture’s
protocols. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (5 ×
103 cells/well) and treated with different concen­trations of
SANG (0.5 μM, 1 μMc, 2 μM, 4 μM) for 24 h. Then 10 ml
CKK-8 was added to each well for 4 h and the absorbance
at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader
(Synergy HT, Biotech). The optical density (OD) values
were determined to reflect the viable cell populations from
each well.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the
cells were seeded at 24-well plates and treated by different
concentrations of SANG or NAC for different periods of
time. The cells were added with 10 mM DCFH-DA and
incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The ROS production in
the cells was determined by measuring the OD values at
excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/525 nm using a
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).

to translate the unique caspase reporter cFluc into clinical
settings, this molecular probe will provide a valuable tool
for high-throughput screening of various pro-apoptotic or
anti-apoptotic drugs and for monitoring their therapeutic
efficacy.

In vivo animal studies
All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with the Guild for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and with animal protocols approved
by Xidian University. Xenografted tumor models were
prepared by injection of 1×107 22B-cFluc cells suspended
in PBS into nude mouse (n=6). After tumors reached a
volume of approximately 100 mm3, SANG (10 mg/kg)
was i.v. injected into mice. After injection for 24 h, 48 h
and 72 h, mice were given a single i.p. dose of 150 mg/kg
D-luciferin and bioluminescence imaging were performed
using a Xenogen Lumina II system. The signal intensity in
the region of interest was expressed as p/sec/cm2/sr using
the Living Image software 4.1 (Xenogen). For the antitumor therapy studies, one group of tumor-bearing mice
(n=6) received intravenously 10 mg/kg of SANG every
other day throughout the experimental period, while the
control group of mice (n=6) received DMSO only. Tumor
growth measurement was calculated as LW2/2, where
L indicates the long diameter and W indicates the short
diameter.
