ABSTRACT:
The serine threonine kinase Akt1 has been implicated in the control of cellular
metabolism, survival and growth. Herein, disruption of the ubiquitously expressed
member of the Akt family of genes, Akt1, in the mouse, demonstrates a requirement
for Akt1 in miRNA-mediated cellular apoptosis. The miR-17/20 cluster is known to
inhibit breast cancer cellular proliferation through G1/S cell cycle arrest via binding
to the cyclin D1 3’UTR. Here we show that miR-17/20 overexpression sensitizes
cells to apoptosis induced by either Doxorubicin or UV irradiation in MCF-7 cells via
Akt1. miR-17/20 mediates apoptosis via increased p53 expression which promotes
Akt degradation. Akt1-/- mammary epithelial cells which express Akt2 and Akt3
demonstrated increased apoptosis to DNA damaging agents. Akt1 deficiency abolished
the miR-17/20-mediated apoptosis. These results demonstrated a novel pathway
through which miR17/20 regulate p53 and Akt controlling breast cancer cell apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

specificity of the Akt1 isoforms is similar, although Akt1
is the predominant isoform expressed in most tissues.
Constitutive activation of Akt1 kinase occurs in human
cancer through deletion and mutation of the tumor
suppressor gene PTEN, the phosphatase that negatively
regulates Akt1, through amplification of the Akt1 genes,
or through amplification of the catalytic subunit of PI3
kinase (5-7). The pro-proliferative and prosurvival effects
induced by Akt1 kinase are conducted through regulation
of caspase 9, I B kinase , Bad, and induction of the GSK3/
cyclin D1 signaling pathways (reviewed in: (8, 9)).
ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor activation, which occurs
frequently in breast cancer, induces PI3K and Akt1 kinase
activity (10, 11). The ErbB2 oncogene is amplified in up
to 30% of human breast cancers and is associated with
poor patient prognosis in response to chemotherapeutic

The cell survival oncoprotein Akt1, also known as
protein kinase B (PKB), is frequently hyperactivated in
human cancers. Akt1 is recruited to the plasma membrane
in the presence of phosphoinositide triphosphate (PI3,4,5-P). Akt1 plays a central role in the ability of external
signals to promote cell survival by preventing cytochrome
c release from mitochondria (1-3) and maintaining
mitochondrial membrane integrity by increasing
hexokinase (HK) association with mitochondria (4).
In mammalian cells, activating growth factors and
oncogenes stimulate Akt1 kinase activity to promote antiapoptotic signaling (4). Three separate genes with high
sequence identity encode the major isoforms of Akt1/
PKB (Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, Akt3/PKBγ). Substrate

agents. ErbB2 induces Akt1 activity, cellular growth
and therapeutic resistance (12). The activation of ErbB2
is an early event in human breast cancer with ErbB2
overexpressed in up to 80% of primary ductal carcinoma
in situ lesions (13). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 2122 nucleotide molecules that regulate the stability or
translational efficiency of targeted messenger RNAs.
Derived from nuclear precursor RNAs, initial processing
occurs by the inter-nuclease Drosha to release premiRNA of 60-70 nucleotides in length from pri-miRNA.
Subsequent transport to the cytoplasm by exportin-5
results in processing by the inter-nuclease Dicer to
generate the ~22 nucleotide mature miRNA (14-16).The
base pairing interactions between miRNAs and their target
mRNAs, often within the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR)
of target genes, results in the degradation of target mRNAs
(17, 18) or inhibition of their translation (19). To date more
than 2,000 miRNAs have been identified or predicted
in humans (miRBase Sequence Database Version 20.0
released in Jun. 2013). It has been proposed that as each
vertebrate miRNA may bind to as many as 200 gene
targets, miRNAs potentially control the expression of
about one-third of human mRNAs (20).
Several independent lines of evidence support a role
for miRNAs in human cancer (21-25). miRNA encoding
genes are frequently located at fragile sites, and in minimal
regions of loss of heterozygosity, minimal regions of
amplification, and in common breakpoint regions involved
in cancers (26). Aberrant expression of miRNAs or
mutations of miRNA genes have been described in many
types of tumors. Let-7 abundance is reduced in several
cancers including lung cancer (27), and let-7 was reported
to regulate tumor growth by targeting the ras gene (28).
miR-15a and miR16-1 were deleted and/or down-regulated
in ~ 70% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(29). miR-15a/16-1 induced apoptosis by inhibiting BCL2 (30). The miR-34 family is an important component of
the p53 tumor suppressor network (25). The human miR17/20 cluster’s genomic location, chromosome 13q31,
correlates with loss of heterozygosity in a number of
different cancers including breast cancer (31, 32). The
expression and function of miRNA varies by cell type.
The miR-17/20 cluster functions as a tumor suppressor
in human breast cancer by decreasing AIB1 and cyclin
D1 expression (33, 34). In contrast, in both lung cancer
and lymphomas, expression of this miRNA cluster was
increased, enhancing cell growth (22, 35). The onset and
progression of tumorigenesis involves evasion of apoptotic
signals, sustained cellular proliferation and the ability to
promote tumor neoangiogenesis. As the same miRNA
performs different functions through distinct pathways
dependent on the tissue or cell type, it is important to
understand the mechanisms by which miRNA regulates
the cellular apoptosis and thereby tumorigenesis.

miR-17/20 sensitized stress
apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

signal-induced

Our previous studies demonstrated the suppression
of cellular proliferation in human breast cancer cells by
miR-17/20. In order to determine the potential role of miR17/20 in regulating breast cancer cell apoptosis, MCF-7
cells were transduced with a retrovirus encoding the miR17/20 cluster. The cells were treated either with 0.05 μM
doxorubicin for 24 hours or with UV radiation and then
analyzed for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Apoptotic cells
were increased in miR-17/20 overexpressing MCF-7 cells
compared to control cells. Thus, miR-17/20 increased
MCF-7 sensitivity to DNA damage inducing agents after
doxorubicin or UV radiation (Fig. 1A and Supplemental
Fig. S1).
	 In order to corroborate the effects of miR-17/20
on apoptosis, anti-miR-17 and anti-miR-20a were applied
to block the function of endogenous miR-17 and miR-20a.
In MCF-7 cells, doxorubicin-induced cellular apoptosis,
assessed by TUNEL analysis, was abolished by anti-miR
treatment in miR-17/20 transduced MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B).
	 In order to identify the mechanisms by which
miR-17/20 regulates cellular apoptosis, analysis was
conducted of apoptosis-regulating pathways and target
genes (p53, p57, Cyto C, Caspase 3, Caspase 9, Bax,
and PARP). The expression of p53 and p27KIP1 increased
in miR-17/20 transduced MCF-7 cells. p57 expression
was unchanged by miR-17/20 treatment (Fig. 1C).
Doxorubicin treatment of MCF-7 cells enhanced miR17/20 induction of p53 (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the
observation, transfection of MCF-7 cells with anti-miR-17
or anti-miR-20a decreased p53 expression (Fig. 1E).
The effect of miR-17/20 was next assessed in the
NAFA cell line which was derived from an ErbB2-induced
mouse mammary tumor. miR-17/20 transduction increased
the sensitivity of NAFA cells to doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL staining (Fig. 1F). The
induction of apoptosis in miR-17/20 transduced NAFA
cells was associated with induction of p27, Bax, p-γ-H2A,
caspase 9 and cleaved PARP (Fig. 1G and Supplementary
Figure S2). Similarly, miR-17/20 induced apoptosis in
MCF-7 cells was associated with induction of Bax, Cyto
C, Bcl-xs, caspase 3 and cleavage of caspase 9 and PARP
(Fig. 2A).

miR-17/20 increased MCF-7 cell sensitivity to
tamoxifen.
The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is the most commonly
used treatment for patients with estrogen-receptor α (ER)positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen resistance occurs in

transduced MCF-7 cells and control were treated with 15
uM tamoxifen up to 36 hours. The relative cell survival

was determined using the MTT assay. As shown in Figure
2B, miR-17/20 overexpression attenuated relative cell
survival in the presence of tamoxifen (Fig. 2B, C). MCF7 control cells showed sensitivity to 15 uM tamoxifen
after 36h treatment while miR-17/20 transduced MCF-7
cells showed sensitivity after 24 hours treatment when
compared to cells without tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 2C).
At both 24h and 35h timepoints, control MCF-7 cells
showed more resistance to tamoxifen than miR-17/20
transduced cells (Fig. 2C).

doxorubicin. The reduction in cell survival of miR17/20 transduced cells was most pronounced (~20%
vs. ~35%) after 72h of treatment (Fig. 3A). miR-17/20
overexpression decreased the IC50 of MCF-7 cells to

curve with 500 nM doxorubicin treatment demonstrated
significantly enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin to

	 miR-17/20 transduction was able to sensitize the
Akt1+/+ cells to doxorubicin treatment, but not Akt1-/- cells
(Fig. 4B, C). Western analysis showed that miR-17/20
overexpression promoted p53 expression in Akt1+/+ cells
rather than Akt1-/- cells (Fig. 4D). Notably, Akt1-/- cells

Akt1 is required for miR-17/20 sensitization
of breast tumor cells to doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis.
Akt and p53 both are important regulators of
stress signal-induced cellular apoptosis (36). miR17/20 sensitized the ErbB2-induced NAFA cell line
to apoptosis. Akt1 is required for the progression of
ErbB2-induced breast tumorigenesis in transgenic mice
(37). We investigated whether Akt1 is involved in the
miR-17/20 sensitized cellular apoptosis. We therefore
derived breast tumor cell lines from MMTV-ErbB2/
Akt1-/- and MMTV-ErbB2/Akt1+/+ litter mate control
mice and thereby assessed the role of Akt1 in miR-17/20
mediated apoptosis. The mammary tumor cell lines were
transduced with either miR-17/20 or control. Apoptosis
assays indicated more apoptotic cells in Akt1-/- tumor cells
than that in Akt1+/+ cells after doxorubicin treatment (Fig.
4A). In addition to doxorubicin, puromycin was applied to
Akt1+/+ and Akt1-/- breast tumor cells to analyze the induced
cellular apoptosis. As shown in supplementary Figure S3,
Akt1-/- cells were more sensitive to puromycin than Akt1+/+

showed much more p53 expression than Akt1+/+ cells (Fig.
4D), which is consistent with our observation of more
apoptotic cells in Akt1-/- cells. Interestingly, increased Akt2
and Akt3 expression was detected in Akt1-/- cells compared
to Akt1+/+ cells (Fig. 4E). Additional analysis on multiple
breast tumor samples from Akt1-/- mice also showed

kinase C, calmodulin TGF-α, map kinases including JNK
and p38 map kinase, and oxidative stress involving the
mitochondrial permeability transition (38)(Reviewed in
(39)). 10 uM tamoxifen treatment induces genotoxic stress
in MCF-7 cells via a DNA damage response through freeradical production (40).
Consistent with the role of the miR-17/20 in
growth inhibition, the human miR-17/20 cluster,
which is located on chromosome 13q31, undergoes
loss of heterozygosity in a number of malignancies,
including breast cancer. In transgenic mice, miR-17/20
overexpression reduced overall tissue growth resulting
in small organs (41). In breast cancer cells, the cell
cycle is controlled through a cyclin D1-miR-17/20 autoregulatory feedback loop (33). Consistent with a model
in which miRNA-17 retards cellular growth in transgenic
mice, these studies demonstrated miR-17/20 inhibits
cyclin D1 gene expression via a 3’ UTR binding site. The
cyclin D1 3’ UTR is spliced in the normal population
(41). The miR-17/20-mediated inhibition of breast
cancer cellular proliferation via cyclin D1 repression,
together with the finding that miR-17/20 inhibits breast
cancer cell invasiveness (42), is consistent with a model
in which miR-17/20 is a negative growth regulator in
breast cancer cells. In this regard, miR-17/20 levels were
reduced in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines and
node-positive breast cancer specimens (42). Furthermore,
cell conditioned media from miR-17/20 overexpressing
MCF-7 cells inhibited the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231
cells by inhibiting secretion of several cytokines and

DISCUSSION
The current studies demonstrated that miR-17/20
induces apoptosis in response to the DNA damaging agents
doxorubicin and tamoxifen. MiR-17/20 transduction of
MCF-7 cells induced p53 and apoptosis characterized by
induction of BAX, release of cytochrome C and induction
of Bcl-X(S). Using Akt1 knockout mammary epithelial
cells, and breast cancer derived cell lines from transgenic
mice, we demonstrated the induction of p53 by miR-17/20
required Akt1. Akt1 inhibited p53 abundance in cultured
mammary epithelial cells. These studies identify a novel
pathway by which the non-coding genome mediates
apoptosis in response to DNA damaging agents, and
thereby enhances sensitivity to drug treatment.
In the current studies, miR-17/20 enhanced
tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Addition of tamoxifen
induced apoptosis with a 4-fold increase in cellular
apoptosis at 24 hours. In prior studies, tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis was shown to involve the estrogen receptor
ERα and additional signaling kinases, including protein

plasminogen activators. In the current work we found the
apoptosis induction by miR-17/20 in breast cancer cells.
miR-17/20 overexpression induced the expression of p53,
Bax, Cyto C and caspases which are key components
of p53-mediated apoptosis pathway (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Figure S4).
In terms of same “seed” sequence shared by miR17 and miR-20a,1,220 conserved target genes for both
miR-17 and miR-20a are predicted by TargetScan tool, in
which quite a few genes are involved in cellular apoptosis
regulation including caspase 7, caspase 2, BCL2-like
11, et al. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) on the 1,220
predicted target genes revealed a cell death network
(Supplemental Figure S5) and a cellular apoptosis pathway
(Supplemental Figure S6).
Deletion of Akt1 abrogated both the inhibition of
cellular proliferation and the induction of apoptosis by
miR-17/20. In the current studies, Akt1 was required for
miR-17/20-mediated induction of p53 abundance. These
findings are consistent with prior observations that Akt1
stabilized p53 in response to DNA damaging agents.
Double-stranded DNA breaks induce cellular lesions that
may lead to chromosomal rearrangements and instability.
Defense mechanisms to maintain stability include cell
cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The doublestranded DNA breaks induced by DNA damaging agents,
including doxorubicin, as used in the current studies, are
recognized by large phosphatidylinositol 3 protein kinases,
including Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and DNAdependent Protein Kinases (DNA-PK) which sequentially
implement the DNA damage response. In resting cells
the levels of p53 protein are low due to the activity of
E3 ubiquitin ligases (MDM2, Pirh2, and COP1). Akt2 was
required for irradiation-induced p53 stabilization (43). In
mouse embryo fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, this DNAPKc/Akt/GSK3á/Mdm2 signaling pathway prevented
Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. In the current studies,
the Akt1-/- MEC cells expressed both Akt2 and Akt3,
indicating that Akt1 is necessary in mammary epithelial
cells for this signaling pathway.
