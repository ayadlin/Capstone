Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults
and carries a dismal prognosis despite aggressive, multimodal treatment regimens
involving maximal resection, radiochemotherapy, and maintenance chemotherapy.
Histologically, GBMs are characterized by a high degree of VEGF-mediated vascular
proliferation. In consequence, new targeted anti-angiogenic therapies, such as the
monoclonal anti‑VEGF‑A antibody bevacizumab, have proven effective in attenuating
tumor (neo)angiogenesis and were shown to possess therapeutic activity in several
phase II trials. However, the role of bevacizumab in the context of multimodal therapy
approaches appears to be rather complex. This review will give insights into current
concepts, limitations, and controversies regarding the molecular mechanisms and
the clinical benefits of bevacizumab treatment in combination with radio(chemo)
therapy - particularly in face of the results of recent phase III trials, which failed to
demonstrate convincing improvements in overall survival (OS).

Background

irradiation-induced DNA damage as well as the delivery
of chemotherapeutics [2, 6]. Among multiple factors
controlling the complex process of angiogenesis, vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its associated
signaling cascade are considered to be of central
importance [5, 7]. Glioma cells are a major source of
VEGF, and high levels of VEGF have been reported to
correlate with high-grade malignancy and poor prognosis
[8, 9]. Radiotherapy (RT) is a mainstay of GBM treatment
and is known to dramatically increase VEGF expression
by transactivating factors, including NFκB and p53 [10].
Accordingly, it was speculated that targeting VEGF might
enhance the efficacy of RT. Upon inhibition of VEGF
signaling the downstream effects (temporary increase in
perfusion, decrease in interstitial edema/hypertension as
well as permeability) should all support the efficacy of

GBMs are highly vascularized tumors that
critically depend on the generation of tumor-associated
blood vessels [1, 2]. They are characterized by a dense
network of highly disorganized, tortuous, large-diameter
vessels with increased basement membrane thickness [3,
4]. The pathological tumor vasculature is functionally
abnormal and leads to increased vessel permeability,
vasogenic edema and hemorrhages [5]. The resulting
rich capillary network may contribute to rapid tumor
growth and poor prognosis. As the vasculature in
GBMs is characterized by a highly disorganized vessel
architecture, this may also limit the efficacy of radioand chemotherapy by compromising blood flow, thereby
enhancing tumor hypoxia and impairing oxygen-mediated,

Therapeutic effects of BEV
and treatment resistance in
preclinical glioma models

concomitant RT [5, 11].
Currently, the most prominent VEGF targeting
drug is bevacizumab (BEV), a recombinant humanized
monoclonal antibody that binds to human VEGF-A.
Several groups have investigated the use of BEV with
an already proven efficacy in metastatic colon, breast,
and lung cancer for patients with recurrent malignant
gliomas [12, 13]. BEV was also tested in combination
with RT in recurrent GBM [14], or as upfront treatment
together with RT and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ)
administration [15, 16]. It proved to be a safe and feasible
treatment option. The mode of action was attributed to
scavenging mechanisms, which counteract irradiationinduced VEGF secretion by inactivating VEGF [17], thus
resulting in consecutive advantageous effects, including
reduction of vascular permeability and edema, improved
oxygenation as well as reduction of radiation necrosis [5,
18]. Furthermore, several phase II trials have documented
the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapies either alone or in
combination with irinotecan [19-25], etoposide [26,
27], nitrosourea [28], or other agents [29, 30]. However,
the initially reported promising response rates to BEV
treatment might be at least in part - attributed to imaging
limitations resulting from decelerated neoangiogenesis and
reduced vascular permeability, thus leading to an apparent
but debatable reduction in the contrast-enhancing tumor
volume [31, 32].
Recent prospective phase III trials (AVAglio &
RTOG 0825) were designed to prove the efficacy of TMZbased radiochemotherapy in combination with BEV as
first-line therapy for GBM. While the RTOG 0825 trial
failed to show significant benefits in terms of progressionfree (PFS) and overall survival (OS), the AVAglio study
demonstrated a significant prolongation of PFS by 4.4
months in the BEV arm. However, this PFS benefit did
not translate into an improvement in OS [33, 34]. In line
with this, several preclinical and clinical studies raised
the concern that BEV treatment might induce a more
invasive tumor phenotype, thereby potentially limiting
the efficacy of radiation therapy due to the stimulation
of tumor cell emigration out of the RT field [35-38].
Moreover, an increased incidence of neurocognitive
side effects was reported for the combination of RT and
BEV treatment and is currently attributed to VEGF’s
role as neuroprotector [39]. Overall, due to the general
limitations of the existing phase II/III trials, it remains
controversial whether the initial preclinical rationale to
combine anti-VEGF treatment and RT has to be regarded
as corroborated or disproven [33, 34], and this is not the
only important question in the field, which waits to be
resolved. Here, we aim at providing an overview of the
current knowledge, hypotheses, and discussions about
the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of BEV
treatment in combination with irradiation and their clinical
implications for the treatment of GBM patients.

Anti-angiogenic therapy targeting VEGF or its
receptors is considered to impact on glioma growth
through several mechanisms, some of which are only
poorly understood [40]. The initial hypothesis was
that anti-angiogenic therapy prunes tumor vessels and
reduces tumor blood perfusion, thereby starving the
tumor of oxygen and essential nutrients, resulting in
reduced tumor growth [41]. However, accumulating
evidence indicates that one therapeutic effect of antiVEGF treatment derives from transient normalization of
the functionally abnormal tumor vasculature, leading to
a reduction in edema and improved tumor oxygenation
[42]. Preclinical studies suggest that this time window
of normalization is important with regard to the schedule
of combination therapies. Winkler et al. hypothesized
that blockade of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) creates a
“normalization window”. Within this time window, the
combination with RT provides the best results of tumor
control, originating from a temporary increase in tumor
oxygenation, which is well known to enhance irradiationinduced DNA damage and thus irradiation-induced
tumor cell death. Mechanistically, vascular normalization
stimulated by VEGFR2 blockade emerges from increased
pericyte coverage of brain tumor vessels via up-regulation
of Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and degradation of the
pathologically thick basement membrane via activation
of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [43]. Dings et al.
described similar findings for BEV treatment and VEGF
inhibition [44]. Interestingly, a similar normalization
effect has been described for radiotherapy itself or in
combination with other treatment modalities [45, 46].
However, although the data on vascular normalization
appear very promising, so far they remain limited to
preclinical and extracerebral models.
In principle, the term “vascular normalization”
might be misleading as some tortuous, largediameter vessels will not immediately disappear upon
administration of BEV (if not already removed by prior
resection). But there is another reason, which supports the
notion that RT and BEV treatment can act synergistically.
The term “window of opportunity” as introduced by Jain
et al. appears to describe the physiological effects that can
be observed during RT and BEV treatment more precisely
[5]. It does not seem to be an anatomically evaluable effect
with less “disturbed” vessels, which turn “normal”, but
rather a functional one. Normalization upon anti-VEGF
treatment appears to be due to higher perfusion rates,
less vascular permeability, less interstitial edema and
hypertension, as well as less subsequent hypoxic burden.
This, in turn, may immediately enhance the efficacy of RT
and is from a kinetic point of view a short-term effect
[11, 47]. Importantly, the potential adverse effects of long2314

anti-angiogenic treatment still remain to be defined.
Meanwhile it is well acknowledged among physicians
and scientists in the neurooncological field that BEVtreated gliomas reveal a more hypoxic, more glycolytic,
and/or more invasive phenotype, although only limited
experimental evidence supporting this issue is available
[53]. This recycled statement mainly relies on cell culture
or preclinical animal models. Detailed analyses were
provided by Keunen and colleagues who characterized
the effects of anti-VEGF treatment in intracranial
glioblastoma xenografts [54]. In this study, a significant
reduction in the cerebral blood flow and the amount of
large and median-sized blood vessels upon anti-angiogenic
treatment was associated with a dramatic increase in
glioma cell invasion into the tumor-surrounding CNS.
The tumor tissue became strongly hypoxic as reflected by
an increase in lactate and alanine production paralleled
by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α).
These changes indicate that anti-angiogenic treatment
shifts energy production in glioma cells predominantly
towards anaerobic glycolysis - a finding, which is
further corroborated by the fact that glioma cells display
decreased numbers of mitochondria upon BEV treatment.
The metabolic switch towards anaerobic glycolysis
is most likely due to changes in the tumor vasculature,
since direct exposition of isolated glioma cells to BEV
did not induce considerable changes in the metabolic
profile [55]. Yet, these results have to be interpreted with
caution, since only one human glioma cell line was used.
The lack of detailed information about a metabolic switch
in human tissue inspired us to address this question in
human glioma cells and tissue samples together with an
international consortium of neurooncological colleagues
[56]. As previously reported in animal models, also
human glioma cells displayed increased lactate production
accompanied by reduced levels of metabolites necessary
for the functioning of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Along
this line, expression levels of glycolytic enzymes were
elevated upon BEV treatment suggesting a switch towards
anaerobic glycolytic metabolism. Immunohistochemical
analyses of post-BEV resection or autopsy samples
revealed increased lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A)
expression not only in perinecrotic areas where LDH-A
expression is commonly seen in treatment-naive samples
but also in large vital tumor parts or even in single glioma
cells diffusely infiltrating the surrounding CNS tissue. All
these findings clearly point towards a metabolic adaptation
process, which is not related to clonal selection of glioma
cell subsets. Meanwhile, in vivo imaging techniques
supporting an intratumoral metabolic switch upon antiangiogenic treatment have been developed [57, 58].
	 In summary, there seems to be a discordant
pattern: On the one hand, BEV treatment apparently
enhances radiosensitivity by reducing tumor hypoxia
during the vascular normalization phase, on the other hand
a switch towards anaerobic glycolysis has convincingly

term anti-VEGF treatment should not be confused with
these obviously positive short-term effects as proven by
preclinical trials [11, 43].
Apart from its impact on tumor vessel architecture
and function, it remains controversial whether or not
BEV possesses direct anti-tumor activity, and to date it
is unknown if there is a threshold dose or dose-response
relationship. We established an orthotopic mouse glioma
model, which allowed us to simultaneously study the
kinetics of morphological and functional vascular
changes, tumor growth, and viability of individual
tumor cells during the course of anti-VEGF therapy
within the same microscopic tumor region in real-time.
Notably, regression of gliomas occurred independently
of vascular regression, suggesting that high doses of
BEV have direct anti-cancer efficacy in vivo [48]. In line
with this, a recent study provided evidence that gliomas
expressing VEGFR2 comprise an aggressive subgroup
of tumors, which develop resistance against TMZ and
BEV treatment very early [49]. On the contrary, other
preclinical studies could not reproduce the beneficial
effects of anti-VEGF treatment on tumor growth control
and improved survival in mice bearing orthotopically
transplanted or autochthonous gliomas [50]. In this
report, the described increase in progression-free survival
times (PFS) in humans was interpreted as a decrease in
vasogenic edema by a stabilization of tumor-associated
brain microvessels and by a still controversially discussed
increase in invasiveness, which in turn might potentially
reduce the diagnosable local tumor mass, e.g. in eloquent
CNS areas. Although VEGFR2 is traditionally regarded
as an endothelial cell protein, there is accumulating
evidence suggesting that VEGFRs may be expressed by
cancer cells [49]. Hamerlik et al. proposed that VEGFR2
is preferentially expressed on the cell surface of CD133+
human glioma stem-like cells, whose viability, selfrenewal, and tumorigenicity rely at least in part on
signaling through the VEGF-VEGFR2-Neuropilin-1
(NRP1) axis. It was hypothesized that a limited impact
of BEV-mediated VEGF blockage may reflect ongoing
autocrine signaling through VEGF-VEGFR2-NRP1 [51].
If these findings can be directly transferred to human
patients is highly questionable, since we and others could
not corroborate the suitability of CD133 as a cancer stem
cell marker in human gliomas [52].

neuroradiological findings, which are associated with
anti-angiogenic therapy and have not been previously
observed under standard radiochemotherapeutic regimens,
fuel the still ongoing debate about pseudo-progression
and/or pseudo-response [69]. This dilemma might best be
resolved by detailed neuroimaging and neuropathological
analyses in a setting allowing for kinetic correlation of
MR changes and histopathology. Another option for
the exclusion or confirmation of a pseudo-response
after BEV treatment might be 18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine
positron emission tomography ([18F]FET-PET). Several
reports have described obvious characteristics following
BEV treatment, but so far no data on combined modality
approaches are available [70-72].

been reported. It remains to be elucidated which of these
mechanisms has higher relevance in clinical practice.

The changing neuroradiological
face
of
gliomas
upon
BEVtreatment
One of the major reasons for the negative regulatory
votum against BEV in the first line therapy of GBM is
the relative uncertainty of imaging criteria during BEV
treatment. The discrepancy between PFS prolongation
and lack of OS benefit was attributed to the reduced
permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) leading to
a delayed detection of tumor recurrence – a phenomenon
termed pseudo-response. Already in very early studies
applying BEV in the context of recurrent gliomas,
more than 75% of the patients showed at least a partial
neuroradiologically confirmed treatment response [59].
Surprisingly, with 27 weeks the OS was only marginally
longer than the PFS pointing towards disease stabilizing
and/or progression masking effects rather than sustained
long-term anti-tumor activity. A significant association
of radiographic responses and high VEGF expression
levels was observed, even though patient survival was
not prolonged [60]. Pioneering neuroradiological work on
BEV treatment in gliomas reported a significant reduction
in the edema-to-tumor volume and a relative decrease
in necrotic areas [61]. We could show that the contrastenhancing tumor volume and edema declined significantly
upon initiation of BEV treatment, whereas the noncontrast-enhancing tumor volume did initially not decrease
but increased strikingly at progression [62]. However,
these results should be interpreted with caution, since
magnetic resonance (MR)-based differentiation between
non-enhancing tumor volume and edema relies on signal
intensities only. Other MR studies revealed that elementary
MR parameters, such as the T1- and T2 relaxation times,
can assess treatment response and also progressive tumor
infiltration with higher sensitivity [58, 63, 64]. The relative
cerebral blood volume (rCBV) has also been identified as
an important neuroradiological parameter to predict the
time to progression (TTP) in BEV-treated GBM patients
[65]. In addition, we observed that T1-hyperintense lesions
with diffusion restriction were positively associated with
prolonged patient survival upon anti-angiogenic treatment
[66, 67]. Parallel computed tomography (CT) imaging
suggested the presence of calcifications in BEV-treated
GBMs, which could be confirmed by means of histological
analyses [67]. Meanwhile it became evident that more
than 50% of all GBM patients treated with BEV develop
similar imaging alterations, which seem to be predictors of
an anti-angiogenic treatment response. Although attempts
to categorize neuroradiological progression under antiangiogenic treatment have been initiated, so far no official
guidelines could be established [68].
In summary, the aforementioned novel

Current status of irradiation
and anti-angiogenic treatment:
Will the cards be reshuffled ?
The treatment of malignant brain tumors has been
subject to a variety of clinical studies combining RT with
BEV with or without TMZ [73]. In 2014, the results of two
large randomized trials on BEV in primary GBM treatment
have been published. In the AVAglio trial, combined
radiochemotherapy with TMZ according to the Stupp
regimen (EORTC 26981 - 22981 NCIC CE3 trial) [74, 75]
was compared to the same regimen in combination with
BEV. The median PFS in the BEV group exceeded that in
the placebo group (10.6 months vs. 6.2 months; HR 0.64;
95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, p<0.001). Yet, the overall survival
(OS) was not significantly different between both groups
(HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02, p=0.10), but improved
maintenance of baseline quality of life and performance
status were observed with BEV. Of note, the rate of
adverse events was also higher in the BEV arm [33]. In
the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,
the results of the similarly designed RTOG 0825 trial were
published. There was no significant difference in median
OS between both treatment arms (15.7 or 16.1 months,
respectively; HR for death in the BEV group 1.13). The
median PFS was longer in the BEV group (10.7 months vs.
7.3 months; HR 0.79), but the pre¬¬specified significance
level for PFS was not reached. In contrast to the AVAglio
trial, where an improved quality of life was reported for
the BEV group, the opposite if any change in the quality
of life and a possible deterioration in neurocognitive
performance was observed in the RTOG 0825 trial [34]. In
summary, both phase III trials failed to show prolongation
of OS by BEV-containing treatment regimens, whereas
significant and marginally significant PFS benefits were
described, and contradicting results were obtained when
evaluating quality of life or neurocognition (no data within
the AVAglio trial), respectively [33, 34].
The phase II GLARIUS trial explored the efficacy
of BEV plus irinotecan compared to standard TMZ in the
first-line radiochemotherapy of GBM patients with non2316

Oncotarget

methylated O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) promoter. In the BEV/irinotecan arm, PFS was
significantly prolonged from a median of 5.9 months
(95% CI 2.7-6.2 months) to 9.7 months (95% CI 8.710.5 months, p=0.0004; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.4-0.79).
Nevertheless, no prolongation of the median OS and no
improvement in the quality of life were observed [76].
In summary, two well-conducted randomized phase
III studies and one phase II trial could not demonstrate
significant OS benefits by adding BEV to standard
radiochemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed
GBM.
One might come to discordant conclusions when
considering the available clinical phase II/III results [33].
Apparently, there are improvements in terms of PFS,
but these might derive from neuroradiological pseudoresponses. Moreover, the failure to show benefits in OS
leaves little place for the notion of putative synergistic
interactions between BEV and RT – at least in the context
of radiochemotherapy. In contrast, the median OS in
the BEV groups was clearly prolonged as compared
to historical controls, and the substantial crossover,
which has taken place within the trials and renders them
statistically difficult to analyze, might account for the
failure to reach the defined endpoint of OS prolongation.
Therefore, longitudinal crossover correction analyses of
the GLARIUS trial are currently in preparation, and the
results are eagerly awaited. Given all these limitations, it
currently remains unclear whether BEV administration in
combination with radiochemotherapy can exert synergistic
effects and clinical efficacy for the first line treatment of
GBM patients. Clearly, treatment schedules as well as
patient selection should be reassessed in order to derive
more conclusive results in the future.
The decision of the EMA (European Medicines
Agency) against BEV for the treatment of newly
diagnosed GBM was based on the results of both RTOG
0825 and AVAglio. However, the observations of initial
attempts to use BEV in recurrent glioma appear promising
and inspired an ongoing second line chemotherapy trial
(EORTC26101, BEV + lomustine), which might lead
to the approval of BEV for the treatment of recurrent
malignant glioma. This trial is based on the efficacy of
BEV and lomustine within the BELOB phase II trial [77].
Accordingly, a reassessment in combination with RT
might be possible in future.

morphological and physiological changes in the tumor
were associated with prolonged PFS in several phase II/III
trials the OS remained virtually unchanged. Which are the
putative reasons for this and how should they be addressed
in the future?

Critical reassessment of the
vessel-normalization concept
and anti-tumoral effects of BEV
in the context of combinatory
treatment strategies
The concept of vascular normalization implies
increased pericyte coverage as well as reduced basement
membrane thickness of tumor vessels, and led to
the hypothesis that these changes could favor tumor
oxygenation, which in turn would improve treatment
effects and thus patient survival [43, 78]. Already in the
pioneering work of Winkler and colleagues the term
“normalization window” was introduced reflecting that
an optimal time window for RT in the context of antiangiogenic treatment does exist [43]. However, it appears
highly challenging to fine-tune the best moment of
vascular normalization for combined treatment modalities
in the clinical routine. From a neuropathological
perspective, it is also difficult to understand how large
glomeruloid vascular structures, once they have been
established in the glioblastoma micromilieu, should
undergo a normalization process, which could be exploited
by radiochemotherapeutic approaches. Moreover, our
intravital microscopy study revealed that regression
of gliomas during anti-angiogenic therapy can occur
independently of vascular normalization, suggesting that
the underlying molecular mechanisms are multifactorial
and comprise more aspects than vascular normalization
only [48]. Hence, it still remains to be determined in
detail if and by which means anti-angiogenic treatment
can set a favorable ground for radio- and/or chemotherapy.
This is of pivotal importance, since combined modality
approaches might also have negative additive effects. For
both irradiation and anti-angiogenic therapy, experimental
studies have shown enhanced glioma cell invasiveness,
and RT can also affect the tumor vasculature [79-82].
Accordingly, future research should aim at deciphering
the putative positive synergistic effects of anti-angiogenic
treatment and RT and particularly also their potentially
detrimental consequences for GBM patients as well as the
underlying mechanisms.

Future directions
We have learned from the treatment of high grade
gliomas with BEV in both preclinical models and clinical
settings that anti-angiogenic therapies considerably change
tumorbiological properties, including vascularization
and tumor cell metabolism. These effects can be clearly
demonstrated by means of neuroradiological and
neuro¬pathological analyses. Nevertheless, although the

across distinct expression signatures might translate
into differential responses to anti-VEGF therapy, patient
stratification in the RTOG 0825 trial was dichotomized
into favorable and unfavorable outcome based on this
9-gene panel. However, no prospectively defined subgroup
of patients exhibited selective survival benefits from the
early administration of BEV [34]. Preliminary molecular
subgroup analyses on the basis of a 10-gene predictor of
mesenchymal-subtype-associated genes warrants further
testing [93]. Pilot data from the AVAglio trial suggest
that the proneural molecular GBM subtype (tumors with
IDH mutations excluded) might respond better to BEV
treatment than the other three molecular subtypes [94].
In summary, for both phase III trials considerable
efforts have been undertaken to define patient subgroups
who would particularly profit from BEV treatment plus
radiochemotherapy. Different strategies were followed.
Whereas the RTOG 0825 consortium started with the
Colman signature and subsequently defined a 9-/10gene set of mesenchymal GBM [92], the AVAglio team
employed subtyping according to Philipps and Verhaak
and could show that for some GBM subgroups BEV
treatment was effective, while for others detrimental
effects could be observed [90, 94]. So far, these subgroup
analyses remain on an exploratory level, and the predictive
significance of the molecular genetic signatures has
to validated. Consequently, independent evaluation is
planned within the GLARIUS cohort, and the results are
awaited with great interest. Taken together, to date no
GBM subtype has been identified to be “advantageous”
when using radiochemotherapy plus BEV, and currently no
reliable a priori evaluation does exist in order to determine
whether or not a patient will profit from BEV therapy.
Independent cross-trial confirmation of putative predictive
biomarkers is lacking, and so their use in current clinical
practice has to be discouraged [41]. Further efforts are
required in order to examine the value of TCGA-based
transcriptional classification as well as other putative
biomarkers with the aim of increasing the likelihood of
successful of anti-angiogenic treatment.

treatment, and striking differences in response rates and
long-term tumor control have been observed. Biomarkers
able to identify patients, who would specifically benefit
from anti-angiogenic therapy in combination with
radiochemotherapy still remain an unmet need not only
in neurooncology [83, 84]. In this regard, baseline levels
and/or variation of numerous intratumoral or circulating
candidate biomarkers have been extensively explored.
However, so far their predictive values remain weak,
and they could rarely be confirmed among different
studies [85]. A recent report suggested that circulating
levels of VEGF-A are prognostic for the outcome of
metastatic colorectal, lung and renal cell cancer, but they
were not predictive for BEV-based treatment benefits
[86]. Elevated VEGF-expression in recurrent malignant
gliomas as determined by IHC, however, was associated
with increased response rates to BEV but did not predict
survival, whereas high expression of carbonic anhydrase
9 (CA9) was related to poor survival outcome [60]. Yet,
in the AVAglio trial pretreatment plasma concentrations of
VEGF and sVEGF did not show significant associations
with PFS or OS, respectively [87]. In the context of
BEV-treatment for recurrent GBM, increased baseline
numbers of CD109+ circulating endothelial cells (CECs)
identified a subgroup of patients with longer PFS and OS,
which also encompassed more long-term responders [88].
Additionally, high MMP2 plasma levels were reported
to be associated with treatment response and survival in
patients with recurrent GBM under BEV treatment but
not under cytotoxic chemotherapy alone [89]. Further
research and randomized clinical trials are clearly needed
in order to evaluate the predictive power of these potential
biomarkers in the future.
Molecular genetic advances have contributed to
a better understanding of GBM pathophysiology and
might have the potential for disease stratification. The
most recent, clinically relevant classification has been
provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium
(TCGA). On the basis of gene expression profiling
with respect to p53, epidermal growth factor (EGFR),
neurofibromin (NFI), platelet-derived growth factor
alpha (PDGFRA) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)
four distinct molecular subtypes of GBMs (proneural,
neural, classical, and mesenchymal) were defined [90].
Importantly, clear differences in prognosis were observed
for these molecular subtypes with proneural GBM
exhibiting relatively favorable prognosis – a finding
that had already been reported before [90, 91]. Colman
et al. further introduced a multigene predictor set of
9 genes associated with a mesenchymal (angiogenic)
GBM phenotype and glioma stem cell markers, which
appears to have considerable potential for optimizing
GBM therapy and for identifying novel therapeutic
approaches in order to specifically target GBMs that are
refractory to standard therapy [92]. Hypothesizing that the

Irradiation and anti-angiogenic
treatment: Brothers in arms or
unholy alliance?
The interaction between VEGF signaling and RT
has been addressed in several preclinical studies [43, 95100]. Irradiation reportedly stimulates the upregulation of
VEGF in different glioma cell lines and xenografts [17,
98], and interfering with VEGF signaling by neutralizing
antibodies has been shown to enhance the anti-tumor
effects of ionizing radiation more than additively [43, 95,
101]. Notably, scavenging VEGF with BEV increased
the sensitivity of both tumor and endothelial cells to
the cytotoxic effects of ionizing irradiation. Hence,
improved tumor control in glioma xenografts by combined

administration of BEV and RT was attributed to the
abrogation of irradiation-induced VEGF signaling and
better tumor oxygenation due to vascular normalization
[11, 43].
The clinical efficacy of BEV application in
combination with RT as assessed by PFS and OS is
currently being extensively discussed. However, one
aspect remains commonly disregarded in this context: The
beneficial impact of BEV on attenuating radiation-induced
cerebral necrosis. To our knowledge, there has been only
one small prospective randomized trial addressing this
issue, and it provided clear evidence for the successful
treatment of radiogenic brain necrosis with BEV [102].
This is of particular interest, since dose escalation has
been a relevant topic in the field of RT for GBM over
years. It has never definitely been proven that a doseresponse-relationship above 60 Gy does exist, and there
are different reasons why several clinical trials failed [103107]. Yet, the high frequency of local and/or in-field GBM
recurrence renders insufficient local tumor control the
most plausible explanation [108-110]. Tsien et al. showed
in a phase I trial that gradual dose escalation up to 84 Gy
is feasible with an acceptable risk of late central nervous
system toxicity. Unfortunately, no data on concomitant
TMZ administration are available, and overall patient
numbers were small [111]. BEV treatment could be a
valuable strategy in the context of dose escalation, since
the induction of radiation necrosis in the brain is a major
concern in this regard [112]. Administration of BEV
could be utilized in order to counteract the onset and/or
aggravation of radiogenic brain necrosis, and irradiation
doses could be increased with the aim of improving local
tumor control. The reasons why BEV can prevent radiation
necrosis are poorly understood. Hypotheses range from a
reduction in interstitial edema, a decrease in interstitial
hypertension to a reduction in the permeability of leaky
vasculature, and others. Notably, some of these also are
supposed to underlie the wanted synergistic interactions
with RT in terms of tumor control [18]. Individual case
reports underscore the dramatic effects of BEV when
treating symptomatic, radiation-induced cerebral necrosis
[113, 114]. Hence, it might be worth to consider increasing
the irradiation dose to achieve improved tumor control
and administering BEV for the protection of the normal
brain parenchyma – at least on a very careful and caseby-case basis. In such aggressive treatment regimens, the
potentially negative influences on neurocognition should
always be payed attention to and need to be properly
assessed.
The increased risk of radiation necrosis was an
initial concern when the concept of re-irradiation of
malignant glioma emerged. However, in recent years this
treatment option has been adopted as safe and effective
[115-121]. For recurrent malignant glioma, BEV was
repeatedly used in combination with re-irradiation. One
group tested the sequential administration of radiosurgery
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and BEV with favorable outcome [122]. Complementarily,
Gutin and co-workers determined the safety and activity
of RT and concomitant BEV treatment. Here, PFS after 6
months (PFS-6) reached 65% for the GBM cohort [14].
In a previous retrospective study on 30 patients (20 being
treated with BEV and 10 without BEV), we could show
that PFS-6 within the BEV-treated group was 72%, and
OS was significantly prolonged [123]. In a second study
with substantially longer follow-up and a higher patient
numbers, the significant post-recurrence survival (PRS)
benefit obtained by BEV application could be confirmed,
and a low incidence of side-effects was observed [124].
Along these lines, there is an ongoing RTOG 1205 trial,
which aims at evaluating improvements in OS for patients
with recurrent GBM receiving BEV and re-irradiation as
compared to patients receiving BEV alone. Other trials
employing BEV and re-irradiation also provided favorable
results [125-127].
One further concern about anti-angiogenic treatment
in the context of RT is an increased stimulation of glioma
cell migration and invasiveness. Results from preclinical
studies have shown that (perivascular) invasion increases
during anti-VEGF therapy and might thereby limit
therapeutic efficacy [50, 128-130]. Tumor cells within the
invasive margins of GBMs can escape anti-angiogenic
therapy and local irradiation, because they can migrate
into surrounding areas of normal brain parenchyma,
which are located outside the irradiation field and whose
intact blood-brain barrier prevents BEV from entering the
tissue. However, these tumor cells have been predicted
to be susceptible to irradiation-induced abrogation of
clonogenic survival providing a further rationale for
combining anti-angiogenic therapy with irradiation of the
tumor surrounding margins, yet at lower doses [99, 131].
Initial clinical reports revealed that anti-VEGF therapies
were associated with non-contrast-enhancing radiographic
tumor progression, which was interpreted as an increase in
tumor invasiveness [35]. Available clinical data, however,
are very heterogeneous, and the major studies do not
uniformly support the assumption that BEV treatment
induces invasive growth at time of recurrence [33, 36, 132,
133]. If a more invasive GBM phenotype emerged during
therapy, this should become obvious in a higher frequency
of out-of-field recurrences due to increased tumor cell
migration [134]. Although a numerically slightly higher
rate of diffuse progressions was observed in the BEV
arm of the AVAglio study, this did not significantly
affect OS. However, the initial growth pattern (diffuse
vs. non-diffuse) was per se prognostic. In patients who
had non-diffuse tumors at baseline, median OS was 20.1
(BEV arm) and 18.4 months (standard arm), whereas for
tumors with diffuse growth patterns at baseline, median
OS was 15.6 (BEV arm) and 16.2 months (standard arm),
respectively [38]. When examining the relapse patterns
in patients with recurrent malignant glioma under BEV
treatment in combination with re-irradiation, we observed
2319

mainly centrally located recurrences [135]. A second
argument commonly listed when discussing the potential
stimulation of glioma invasiveness under BEV treatment
is that in view of improved PFS and equal OS in the BEV
arms of AVAglio and RTOG 0825, post-PFS survival
apparently is decreased in comparison to non-BEV treated
patients. Yet, this issue is difficult to evaluate, since the
relevant crossover rates within both trials render them
statistically complex to analyze (31% within the AVAglio
trial, RTOG 0825 even higher). Crossover correction
analyses are required in order to address this concern
comprehensively.
Finally, a major caveat of BEV application in
combination with RT in GBM remains: detrimental
neurocognitive effects. Unfortunately, RTOG 0825 and
AVAglio, do not provide conclusive results in this regard.
From a physiological point of view, this hypothesis cannot
be declined, since VEGF is a relevant neuroprotector and
its targeting might give rise to possible negative side
effects of RT. Available literature on this topic delineates a
similar picture in animal models, where VEGF apart from
stimulating microvascular proliferation and angiogenesis
- enhances neuronal differentiation, protection, and

regeneration [39, 136]. Therefore, it is conceivable
to assume that VEGF blockade augments irradiationinduced neurological toxicity [137, 138]. Concerning
neurocognitive performance, the RTOG 0825 consortium,
in contrast to the AVAglio consortium, incorporated
formal neurocognitive testing in order to assess cognitive
performance. Intriguingly, adverse effects on processing
speed and executive functions in patients receiving BEV
as compared to patients in the standard arm were noted
[34].

Conclusions
Overall, it remains unclear how the therapeutic
alliance of RT and BEV application for GBM will develop.
In our opinion, there are several open questions, which
need to be addressed in the future.
Are there subgroups of patients who are specifically
eligible or not suitable for BEV/RT treatment?
Having predictive biomarkers would be highly
advisable, and a validation of already defined subgroups
is of utmost importance.
What are the molecular mechanisms of BEV-

Figure 1: Proposal of patient stratification for BEV treatment in GBM. For GBM patients with gross total resection standard
treatment including radiochemotherapy with TMZ is still considered to be the most promising therapy. The same applies for both completely
and partially resected GBMs with MGMT promoter methylation, since this subcohort shows a significant benefit from TMZ chemotherapy.
In contrast, patients with incompletely resected GBM in conjunction with a non-methylated MGMT promoter might considerably profit
from (hypo)fractionated (re‑)irradiation in combination with BEV treatment.

mediated radioprotection of normal brain parenchyma
and might dose-escalation make sense when detrimental
effects on the normal tissue can be avoided?
It is relevant to delineate in how far dose escalation
with concomitant BEV treatment is feasible.
After RT/BEV treatment, how long should
maintenance BEV therapy be performed?
Some of the adverse effects could be related to
sustained BEV treatment alone and not to the combined
RT/BEV regimen.
Clearly, future trials need to focus on patient
subgroups for whom real benefits in terms of PFS and
OS can be expected as depicted in Figure 1. Patients
with both primary GBM or recurrent malignant glioma
(pre-irradiated) should be considered. Out of these,
patients with gross total resection should be excluded,
since tortuous vessel formations, for which the combined
effects of BEV and RT might be particularly helpful, are
unlikely to be present. The same would apply to GBMs
with methylated MGMT promoter, since RT plus TMZ
alone is the treatment of choice in these cases, and there is
little probability that BEV can add relevant improvement
after two phase III trials without OS benefits. If a certain
molecular subgroup, such as the mesenchymal GBM type,
should be excluded continues to be unclear, and further
studies addressing this question are needed. The remaining
tumors will be the inoperable ones or the ones where only
subtotal resection is possible due to the involvement of
critical CNS structures. In these cases, dose escalation
with concomitant BEV treatment might be considered and
(hypo)fractionated re-irradiation might be a therapeutic
option. The optimal duration of subsequent maintenance
therapy with BEV remains yet to be determined, since it
has not been proven that a perpetuation exerts relevant
benefits and potential adverse side effects might be caused
by long-term BEV treatment per se [139].
One facet of BEV treatment, which is currently
moving into the focus of interest, and has not been
intensively discussed here, are the immunological
consequences of anti-angiogenic therapy. The tumor
microenvironment and particularly the tumor endothelium
appear to strongly impact on the regulation immune
mechanisms and thus contribute to the establishment of
an immunosuppressive milieu. VEGF has been attributed
an essential role in this regard. Accordingly, interfering
with VEGF function is known to have local as well as
systemic immunological effects, which - not only due to
the advent of immunotherapeutic approaches - certainly
will be further examined in future studies [140, 141].
