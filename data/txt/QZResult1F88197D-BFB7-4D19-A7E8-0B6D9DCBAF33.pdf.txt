Abstract
The AMPK-related kinase NUAK2 has been implicated in
melanoma growth and survival outcomes, but its therapeutic
utility has yet to be conﬁrmed. In this study, we show how
its genetic ampliﬁcation in PTEN-deﬁcient melanomas may
rationalize the use of CDK2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy.
Analysis of array-CGH data revealed that PTEN deﬁciency is
coupled tightly with genomic ampliﬁcation encompassing the
NUAK2 locus, a ﬁnding strengthened by immunohistochemical
evidence that phospho-Akt overexpression was correlated with
NUAK2 expression in clinical specimens of acral melanoma.
Functional studies in melanoma cells showed that inactivation
of the PI3K pathway upregulated p21 expression and reduced the

number of cells in S phase. NUAK2 silencing and inactivation of
the PI3K pathway efﬁciently controlled CDK2 expression, whereas CDK2 inactivation speciﬁcally abrogated the growth of
NUAK2-ampliﬁed and PTEN-deﬁcient melanoma cells. Immunohistochemical analyses conﬁrmed an association of CDK2
expression with NUAK2 ampliﬁcation and p-Akt expression in
melanomas. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK2 was
sufﬁcient to suppress the growth of NUAK2-ampliﬁed and
PTEN-deﬁcient melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our
results show how CDK2 blockade may offer a promising therapy
for genetically deﬁned melanomas, where NUAK2 is ampliﬁed
and PTEN is deleted. Cancer Res; 75(13); 2708–15. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

migration in melanoma cells (2, 5–14). The signiﬁcance of
NUAK2 in melanomagenesis is highlighted by the fact that high
expression of NUAK2 has an impact on the survival of patients
with acral melanomas, in addition to the fact that NUAK2
participates in the regulation of cell proliferation of melanomas
in general (12). On the other hand, synergistic effects of several
genomic aberrations are also quite important to facilitate
tumorigenesis of cancer cells such as that the PI3K pathway
participates in melanomagenesis (15, 16).
The elucidation of genomic aberrations, including mutations,
has progressed using systematic approaches (17). However,
detailed mechanisms controlling cell-cycle progression by
NUAK2 and additional genes remain to be elucidated. Analyses
of cell-cycle progression in NRAS-mutated and MITF-ampliﬁed
melanomas showed that control of the cell cycle is differently
regulated by CDKs in melanoma cells, where CDK4 is a key driver
in NRAS-mutant melanomas, whereas CDK2 has a pivotal role in
melanomas with high expression of MITF (18–20) Those results
imply that elucidation of mechanisms regulating the cell cycle by
different genomic aberrations should reveal the different impact
of CDKs on the cell cycle.
In melanomas, BRAF mutations have been identiﬁed as
activating mutations that facilitate melanomagenesis, and this
discovery accelerated molecular targeted therapies against melanomas using drugs such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib (1, 2).
However, BRAF mutations have diverse discrepancies among
subtypes of melanomas (21). Some subtypes of melanomas, such
as acral and mucosal melanomas, have low frequencies of BRAF
mutations and are speculated to respond poorly to those therapies

Recent advances in cancer genomics facilitate the elucidation
of aberrant downstream pathways in tumor cells with genomic
aberrations and pave the way to develop speciﬁc therapies for
novel oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in many types of
cancers (1–4). In melanomas, several genomic aberrations,
such as mutations, ampliﬁcations, and deletions in BRAF,
NRAS, INK4A, MITF, PREX2, GNAQ, and KIT, have been
reported, and recent analyses using array-CGH data also suggested that NUAK2, which resides at chromosome 1q32, is an
important gene that regulates cell-cycle progression and cell

targeting BRAF mutations. Molecular targeted therapies aimed
at genomic aberrations other than BRAF mutations should be
developed for the better management of patients with those
subtypes of melanomas.
In this study, we explore additional genomic aberrations and
downstream pathways of NUAK2 and demonstrate that NUAK2
and the PI3K pathway coordinately control CDK2. In addition, we
showed that CDK2 is an efﬁcient therapeutic target by abrogating
the growth of cutaneous melanomas.

Materials and Methods
Tumor specimens
We obtained 91 parafﬁn-embedded specimens of primary
melanomas from three institutions. This study was approved by
the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Research Committee,
the Osaka University Clinical Research Committee, and the Saitama Cancer Center Research Ethics Committee. Fifty-six tumors
were classiﬁed as acral melanomas and 35 as non-chronic suninduced damage (CSD) melanomas, but none was a CSD melanoma according to the deﬁnition by Curtin and colleagues (22).
Cell lines
Normal human melanocyte and melanoma cell lines were
cultured and maintained as previously described (23). C32,
A375, and Malme-3M melanoma cells were purchased from the
ATCC. SKMel28 and SKMel23 melanoma cells were kindly provided by the Surgery Branch, NCI/NIH (Bethesda, MD). SM2-1
melanoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. H. Murata (Shinshu
University, Matsumoto, Japan). The Mel2 melanoma cell line was
established from a lymph node metastasis of a 68-year-old
Japanese male acral melanoma patient in 1998, and the mel18
melanoma cell line was established from a lymph node metastasis
of a 51-year-old Japanese male acral melanoma patient in 1998 in
our laboratory, as described previously (24). C32, mel2, mel18,
and SM2-1 melanoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 C in a 5% CO2
incubator. All other melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM with
5% FBS. The original C32, A375, and Malme-3M melanoma cells
were short tandem repeat (STR) DNA proﬁled in 2012.
Vectors, siRNA transfection, and Lentiviral infection
SMARTpool siRNAs against CDK2 and PTEN were purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. Lentiviral vectors carrying shRNA
targeting NUAK2 (AAB66-F-6: AAACCCAGGGCTGCCTTGGAAAAG and AAB66-F-7: AAACCCAGGGCTGCCTTGGAAAAG)
and the empty vector were purchased from Open Biosystems in
the pLKO.1puro vector. For siRNA experiments, cells were seeded
at 3.0  105 cells/well in 6-well plates and were transfected either
with an siNT (non-targeting) or with an siRNA against CDK2 or
PTEN (SMARTpool siRNAs, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) at a concentration of 100 pmol/well using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All siRNA
experiments were performed in triplicate. Infection of Lentivirus
containing shRNA constructs with pLKO.1 against NUAK2 into
cells was performed as previously described (12).
In vitro assays
For cell number analyses using siRNA, cells were seeded at 3.0 
105 cells/well in 6-well plates in triplicate. Cell numbers were

www.aacrjournals.org

counted at days 0, 2, and4 after transfection of siRNA. For cell
number analyses treated with roscovitine, cells were seeded at 2.0
 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cell numbers were counted at
days 3, 5, and 7 after treatment with roscovitine.
For proliferation assays of C32 and SM-KT1 cells, cells were
seeded at 1.0  105 cells/well in 24-well plates in quadruplicate.
At 48 hours, cell proliferation was measured using the MTS assay
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Takara Bio).
For colony growth assays with roscovitine, cells were seeded at
1.0  105 cells/well (C32, mel2, and mel18) or 5.0  104 cells/
well (A375, SKMel28, and SKMel23) in 6-well plates in triplicate.
After treatment with roscovitine for 14 days, cells were ﬁxed and
stained with crystal violet; measurements were performed at an
optical density of 610 nm.
Cell-cycle proﬁle analyses were performed as previously
described (12). Cells were treated with LY294002 at 20 mmol/L
for 24 hours.
Animal model
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Keio University. Of note, 3  106 C32
melanoma cells, 3.0  106 SM2-1 melanoma cells, and 3.0  106
mel18 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into nude
mice (4 or 5 per group, as noted). Seven days after injection of
tumor cells, mice were orally treated with 2 mg/dose roscovitine
(every day for 10 days). Tumor sizes were then measured at day 10
of treatment.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (20).
Antibodies used included a rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho
(Ser473) Akt antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), a
rabbit polyclonal anti-NUAK2 antibody (1:1,000; Proteintech
Group), a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (1:1000;
Abcam), a rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK2 antibody (1:2,000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit monoclonal anti-CDK4 antibody
(1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), a mouse monoclonal antiCDK6 antibody (1:500; Abcam), a rabbit monoclonal anti-p21
antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), a rabbit monoclonal anti-p27 antibody (1:1,000; Abcam), a rabbit monoclonal
anti-Akt(pan) antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), and
a rabbit monoclonal anti-PTEN antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling
Technology).
Immunohistochemical analysis
IHC was performed as previously described (12). Antibodies
were used at the following dilutions: anti-phospho (Ser473)
Akt (1:25), anti-PTEN (1:100), anti-NUAK2 (1:100), anti-p27
(1:100), and anti-CDK2 (1:2,000). For immunostaining of
CDK2 and p27, staining was developed with a Vector VIP
Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories) in pigmented melanomas
or with a Vector DAB Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories) using
counterstaining in nonpigmented melanomas. Cells stained in
the nucleus and/or both the nucleus and the cytoplasm were
counted as positive, and cells that stained only in the cytoplasm
were counted as negative. Immunostaining of CDK2 was scored
from 0 to þ3 (0, 0 to 10%; þ1, 11% to 25%; þ2, 26% to 50%;
or þ3, 51% to 100%), depending on the percentages of cells in
a blind fashion by three observers. The basal expression group
(negative staining group) includes specimens with a 0 score,

and the overexpression group (positive staining group)
includes specimens with þ1, þ2, or þ3 scores.
IHC using ﬂuorescence was performed as previously described (12) using the anti-p21 antibody (1:100). Images were
captured using a Leica DMR B/D MLD ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica) and a Dage-MTI 3CCD 3-chip color video camera
(Dage-MTI).
Statistical analysis
For comparisons between two groups, P values were calculated
using two-tailed Student t tests. Repeated two-way ANOVA analysis was applied to check the effect of roscovitine on C32 and
mel18 cells. In all the experiments, differences were considered
statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2. The Fisher exact test was used to test the
relationship between NUAK2 expression and p-AKT (S473)
expression in acral melanoma and non-CSD patients. The differences of survival time among patients with different types of gene
expression were tested by the log-rank test. Kaplan–Meier curves
were performed in the R Survival package.

Results
Downstream pathways affected by NUAK2
To efﬁciently explore downstream targets that could suppress
the growth of NUAK2-ampliﬁed melanoma cells, we set out to
elucidate additional genomic changes and mechanisms that
would facilitate the identiﬁcation of targets in the downstream
pathway of NUAK2. We ﬁrst explored potential correlations
between NUAK2 ampliﬁcation and genetic aberrations of other
melanoma-related genes: CDKN2A deletion, CDK4 gain,
MDM2 gain, CCND1 gain, and PTEN deletion using a public
array database (series GSE2631). Biostatistical analysis showed
that only a deletion of PTEN correlated with the gain of "RP11243M13," which is the nearest clone to NUAK2 (P ¼ 0.0004),
in acral melanomas. To conﬁrm this, we used immunohistochemical analyses of clinical specimens to show that the
expression of NUAK2 and p-Akt (S473) has a signiﬁcant correlation (P < 0.001) in acral melanomas (Table 1; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2 and Supplementary Table S1). Kaplan–
Meier curves were used to show survival time differences
among patients with different types of gene expression, and
relapse-free survival time of patients with expression of both
NUAK2 and p-Akt (S473) was dramatically shorter than
patients with either NUAK2 or p-Akt alone (P ¼ 0.002) compared with overall survival time (P ¼ 0.072; Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Survival analyses were also applied
to data of non-CSD melanoma patients, but no signiﬁcant
differences were found among patients with different gene
expression types (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Those

expression of both NUAK2 and p-Akt (S473) was not different from those of
either NUAK2 or p-Akt (S473) alone (P ¼ 0.721). Log-rank test was used to
detect survival time differences among three groups of patients: (i) neither
NUAK2 nor p-Akt (S473) positive; (ii) either NUAK2 or p-Akt (S473) positive;
(iii) both NUAK2 and p-Akt (S473) positive. If we only compare groups 3 and 2
in acral melanomas, the P value is 0.003.

analyses led us to speculate that cooperation between both
the NUAK2 and PI3K pathways is critical to tumorigenesis and
that convergent points of those two pathways would be efﬁcient targets to suppress the growth of NUAK2-ampliﬁed
melanomas.
An initial study showed that NUAK2 participates in melanoma cell proliferation by controlling the cell cycle (12). A
previous in vivo study using C32 melanoma cells with or without
knockdown of NUAK2 showed that the tumor growth of C32
melanoma cells was signiﬁcantly suppressed by knockdown of
NUAK2 (12). In order to elucidate downstream pathways that
connect NUAK2 to the cell-cycle machinery, we focused on
examining the expression of genes in the mTOR, JNK, HIF,
cadherin, and Rho-Rock pathways using a lentiviral vector
containing shRNA targeting NUAK2 (shNUAK2; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Those analyses revealed that only mTOR is modulated
by the knockdown of NUAK2 (12). For further detailed analyses,
we used both NUAK2-ampliﬁed and PTEN-deﬁcient melanoma
cells as C32 melanoma cells (NUAK2: 3.94-fold) from non-CSD
melanomas and SM2-1 melanoma cells (NUAK2: 2.12-fold)
from acral melanomas, and we used mel18 melanoma cells

without ampliﬁcation of NUAK2 or deﬁciency of PTEN as a
control from acral melanomas (Supplementary Table S2). We
initially conﬁrmed that knockdown of NUAK2 in both C32
melanoma cells and SM2-1 melanoma cells reduced cell numbers (Fig. 2A), and the S-phase population was reduced by
modulating either the NUAK2 pathway, using shNUAK2,
and/or the PI3K pathway, using LY294002 (Fig. 2B). Although
the S-phase population of SM2-1 melanoma cells could be
examined only by modulating the PI3K pathway using
LY294002 due to massive apoptotic destruction of cells by
modulating the NUAK2 pathway (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S4), we then proceeded to examine the expression of genes
that control the cell-cycle machinery, such as CDK2, CDK4,
CDK6, p21 and p27. Knockdown of NUAK2 by shNUAK2
downregulated the expression of CDK2 and upregulated the
expression of p27. SM2-1 melanoma cells did not express both
p21 and p27 (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of the PI3K pathway by
LY294002 downregulated the expression of CDK2 and upregulated the expression of p21 (Fig. 3B). Immunohistochemical
analysis of p21 expression also showed that inhibition of the
PI3K pathway by LY294002 increased the percentage of p21-

positive cells from 63.7% to 92.3% (Supplementary Fig. S5),
and immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of p27 in
clinical specimens showed that 86% (6 of 7 cases) of primary
melanomas with high expression of both NUAK2 and p-Akt
express p27 (Supplementary Table S3). Knockdown of PTEN by
siPTEN slightly increased the expression of CDK2 in mel18
melanoma cells; however, the cell number was not affected
(Fig. 3C and D). In addition, the NUAK2 and PI3K pathways
were independently regulated by NUAK2 (Fig. 3E). From these
observations, we speculated that both the NUAK2 and PI3K
pathways control the expression of CDK2, increase the S-phase
population in the cell-cycle proﬁle, and increase the proliferation of both C32 and SM2-1 melanoma cells (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Therefore, we hypothesized that CDK2 might be an
efﬁcient target to suppress the proliferation of NUAK2-ampliﬁed
melanoma cells that are PI3K pathway activated.

Effect of roscovitine on melanoma growth
To inhibit CDK2 activity, we evaluated the efﬁcacy of a CDK
inhibitor (roscovitine, also known as seliciclib and CYC202)
that signiﬁcantly inhibits CDK1 and CDK2 but not CDK4 or
CDK6. The proliferation of C32 melanoma cells was inhibited
96.7% (P ¼ 0.011) by 5 mmol/L roscovitine, whereas only an
18.8% decrease (P ¼ 0.008) occurred in mel18 melanoma
cells at the same dose of roscovitine (Fig. 5A). Similarly, roscovitine at 5 mmol/L signiﬁcantly reduced the colony growth
of C32 melanoma cells, compared with mel18 melanoma
cells (Fig. 5B). Cell-cycle proﬁle analyses showed that the
S-phase population of C32 melanoma cells treated with roscovitine at 5 mmol/L was signiﬁcantly reduced from 6.9% to
1.8% (P < 0.001), but 25 mmol/L roscovitine was required
to achieve a similar effect on mel18 melanoma cells (Fig. 5C).
In other cell lines with different NUAK2 and PTEN status,
roscovitine had diverse effects, depending on the cell lines

siRNA SMARTpools targeting CDK2 (siCDK2), and used mel18
melanoma cells (without aberration of both NUAK2 and
PTEN) as a control (Supplementary Table S2). After conﬁrmation of the efﬁcient knockdown by siCDK2 in both of those
melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7), we evaluated cell
numbers at days 2 and 4. Knockdown of CDK2 dramatically
reduced the number of C32 and SM2-1 melanoma cells at day
4, whereas knockdown of CDK2 had no effect on the number
of mel18 melanoma cells (Fig. 4). Those results suggest that
CDK2 preferentially participates in regulating the cell-cycle
machinery in NUAK2-ampliﬁed C32 and SM2-1 melanoma
cells. Immunohistochemical analyses also showed a high percentage (35 in 43 cases; 81.40%) of expression of CDK2 in both
NUAK2 and p-Akt expressed melanomas (Supplementary
Fig. S8 and Supplementary Table S1). Taken together, we
postulated that CDK2 is a candidate target to inhibit the
proliferation of NUAK2-ampliﬁed melanoma cells.

A CDK inhibitor targeting CDK2 effectively suppresses the cell proliferation of NUAK2-ampliﬁed melanomas. A, sensitivity of C32 and mel18 melanoma cells to
roscovitine. Short-term cell number analyses showed that the growth of C32 cells is suppressed by roscovitine at a dose of 5 mmol/L or less. B, cell
proliferation assay showed that the growth of C32 cells is efﬁciently suppressed by roscovitine at 5 mmol/L compared with a slight suppression of the
growth of mel18 cells at the same dose. C, FACS analysis of the cell-cycle proﬁle of C32 and mel18 melanoma cells treated with roscovitine at 0, 5,
and 25 mmol/L. The S-phase population of C32 melanoma cells is signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with roscovitine at 5 mmol/L (top; n ¼ 3, P < 0.001), but
the S-phase population of mel18 melanoma cells is not changed by treatment of roscovitine at 5 mmol/L (bottom).

(Supplementary Fig. S9 and Supplementary Table S2). We then
assessed the effects of roscovitine on the proliferation of C32,
SM2-1, and mel18 melanoma cells in vivo using mice. Tumor
growth was signiﬁcantly suppressed in both C32 melanoma
cells (P ¼ 0.0053) and SM2-1 melanoma cells (P ¼ 0.0101)
compared with mel18 melanoma cells (P ¼ 0.2136; Fig. 6).
These in vitro and in vivo results indicate that treatment with a
low dose of roscovitine effectively suppresses the growth of
NUAK2-ampliﬁed melanoma cells.

Discussion
A wide variety of cancers have genomic aberrations of gains
and/or ampliﬁcation of the long arm of chromosome 1. In
melanomas, several candidate genes have been speculated as
oncogenes at the long arm of chromosome 1. Further, several

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer-related genes have been linked to copy-number increases
of chromosome 1q, including SETDB1 and MDM4. Analyses of
genomic aberrations at 1q in this study using array-CGH data
identiﬁed a minimal region at 1q32, which is signiﬁcantly
related with tumor thickness in acral melanomas, and show
that NUAK2 is a gene that promotes melanomagenesis at this
locus. We cannot rule out the possibility that other genes
participate in melanomagenesis in association with NUAK2 or
alone at 1q32. However, either SETDB1 or MDM4 have quite a
low possibility as the responsible gene at 1q32. SETDB1 resides
at 1q21.3, which is far away from 1q32. SETDB1 has been
identiﬁed as a gene related to BRAF mutation (V600E) (25), and
a genome-wide association study showed that 1q21.3 is a novel
melanoma susceptibility locus in an Australian cohort (26).
Those two previous reports suggest that SETDB1 is a gene that
participates in melanomagenesis in "non-CSD melanomas," not

in acral melanomas. The possibility that SETDB1 cooperates
with NUAK2 to confer tumorigenicity cannot be excluded,
because the long arm of chromosome 1 has two ampliﬁcation
sites of cent-1q21 and 1q32 in melanoma cells. However, the
possibility that SETDB1 is an acral melanoma oncogene at 1q32
is quite low. Regarding MDM4, our immunohistochemical
studies showed that the possibility of MDM4 as the responsible
gene at 1q32 was excluded. Although our initial studies exploring MDM4 as an acral melanoma oncogene from the CGH array
data and real-time PCR data revealed the possibility of MDM4 as
an oncogene at this locus, our intensive studies ruled out the
possibility of MDM4 as an oncogene by clear IHC data because
the expression of MDM4 did not correlate with tumor thickness
in clinical specimens of acral melanomas. MDM4 has been
speculated to participate in melanomagenesis, particularly in
non-CSD melanomas. A previous study of MDM4 expression in
melanomas showed almost identical data to our IHC data (27).
Thus, MDM4 can be excluded as an acral melanoma oncogene at
the 1q32 locus.
Control of the cell-cycle machinery has a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor growth of cancer cells. In
melanomas, genomic aberrations of melanoma cells have different impacts on the regulation of cell-cycle machinery by CDKs,
such as that CDK4 is a key driver in NRAS-mutant melanomas and
that CDK2 has a pivotal role in melanomas with high expression
of MITF (18–20). This study showed that NUAK2 controls CDKs
in melanoma cells, and that both the knockdown of NUAK2 and
inactivation of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 suppress the
expression of CDK2. In addition, knockdown of CDK2 using
siCDK2 efﬁciently reduced the cell number. Those results were
obtained using three melanoma cell lines (C32, SM2-1, and
mel18), in which the genomic status of NUAK2 and PTEN was
estimated using real-time PCR, and expression levels of either
mRNA and protein were estimated by real-time PCR and Western
blotting, respectively. We selected "roscovitine" as an inhibitor
targeting CDK2 in order to suppress the tumor growth of melanoma cells with NUAK2 ampliﬁcation. Although roscovitine has
an ability to inhibit several CDKs in addition to CDK2, the results
of the cell proliferation assay indicate that roscovitine can efﬁciently suppress the proliferation of NUAK2-ampliﬁed melanoma
cells, and the results of our animal model study are consistent with
that.

2714 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

In summary, this study demonstrates that CDK2 is an effective
molecular target for the treatment of NUAK2-ampliﬁed melanomas. The inhibition of CDK2 by roscovitine is a rational approach
to reduce cell proliferation and to delay tumor growth, and
provides a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cutaneous melanomas.
