ABSTRACT
The identification of new surrogate endpoints for advanced colorectal cancer
is becoming crucial and, along with drug development, it represents a research
field increasingly studied. Although overall survival (OS) remains the strongest
trial endpoint available, it requires larger sample size and longer periods of time for
an event to happen. Surrogate endpoints such as progression free survival (PFS)
or response rate (RR) may overcome these issues but, as such, they need to be
prospectively validated before replacing the real endpoints; moreover, they often
bear many other limitations. In this narrative review we initially discuss the role of
time-to-event endpoints, objective response and response rate as surrogates of OS
in the advanced colorectal cancer setting, discussing also how such measures are
influenced by the tumor assessment criteria currently employed. We then report recent
data published about early tumor shrinkage and deepness of response, which have
recently emerged as novel potential endpoint surrogates, discussing their strengths
and weaknesses and providing a critical comment. Despite being very compelling,
the role of such novel response measures is yet to be confirmed and their surrogacy
with OS still needs to be further investigated within larger and well-designed trials.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the remarkable survival improvements
achieved with modern therapies, unresectable metastatic
colorectal cancer (CRC) remains an incurable disease with
a 5-year survival rate of approximately 10% [1]. Because
of the availability of several active drugs and regimens [2],
the assessment of novel treatments may raise new
difficulties, including the following:
a) if the trial evaluates the effect on survival of a new
treatment given after one or more of such active
therapies have failed (second-line setting or later),
enrolled patients may be less likely to respond to the new

Furthermore, since the relatively marginal survival
benefits that are considered clinically worthwhile by the
communities of patients and physicians are narrow [3]
and the post-progression survival tends to increase [4],
the sample size of randomized trials designed for
evaluating new drugs in the metastatic setting is becoming
prohibitively large [5].
Overall survival (OS) has been traditionally
considered as the most important therapeutic objective for
patients with advanced CRC [6]. These issues, however,
could be partially overcome if OS was replaced as primary
trial endpoint by surrogate endpoints such as progression
free survival (PFS) or response rate (RR). These endpoints
would allow researchers to assess the beneficial effects
of a new treatment in less time, reducing the sample
size needed, and avoiding the confounding effects of
treatments administered after disease progression.
In this narrative review we discuss the evidence
in support and against the use of surrogate endpoints
in clinical trials in metastatic CRC. In particular, while
commenting on the value of early tumor shrinkage and
deepness of response compared with the role of objective
response, we discuss if the substitution of the objective
response with these novel parameters might replicate its
surrogacy.

endpoint. Unfortunately, while empirical criteria for
surrogate endpoint definition are still debated, clinical
decisions based on invalid surrogate endpoints may have
public health consequences [9–13].

Time-to-event endpoints as surrogates of
overall survival
Besides OS, other time-to-event endpoints such
as PFS and time-to-progression (TTP) may be useful
in later stages of drug development, providing valuable
information with the advantage of being unaffected by
subsequent therapies [6]. In the advanced CRC setting,
PFS was validated as a surrogate for OS by strong
evidence when using chemotherapy alone [14, 15].
An analysis conducted in 4,352 patients diagnosed with
advanced CRC and treated with chemotherapy in 13 trials
showed a correlation coefficient (R) between treatment
effects on PFS and on OS of 0.99 (95%CI, 0.94 to 1.04)
when all trials were considered. Moreover, the same
analysis showed that a hazard ratio (HR) of at least 0.77
in terms of PFS would predict a benefit in terms of OS
[14]. Based on these results, PFS was chosen as primary
endpoint in the majority of first-line randomized trials.
The same surrogacy, however, appeared to be less
relevant when combining chemotherapy with Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-inhibitors or Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)–inhibitors, although the
data are still unclear. A meta-analysis of 50 trials with
overall 22,736 patients showed a correlation within PFS
and OS of 0.52 in trials containing monoclonal antibodies
[16]. Notably, the analysis showed a strong correlation
in 7 cetuximab- or panitumumab-based trials including
1,335 patients (R 0.96), whereas the correlation within PFS
and OS was lower (R 0.45) in 11 bevacizumab-based trials
with a global number of 3,310 patients. Such findings were
recently confirmed also by Ciani’s meta-analysis which
showed that surrogacy relationships observed between PFS
and TTP vs. OS in selected settings may not apply across
other classes or lines of therapy [17].
The use of PFS as primary endpoint however has
some limitations, such as the timing of tumor assessment
and the difficulties related to the categorization of patients
without measurable disease. As a matter of fact, PFS needs
accurate monitoring of tumor assessment, and unaware
independent radiologists should revise the imaging.
Moreover, the time of disease progression detection
may depend on the reassessment time schedule. In fact,
estimates of PFS are highly dependent on the time in
which we look for progression. In a two-arm study, for
example, comparison of PFS across treatment arms was
often based on assessment intervals that differed across
arms [18]. Definition of PFS depends also on the date of
randomization. That information is relevant considering
that PFS interval is alternately calculated from the start
of maintenance therapy in some cases or from the start of
first-line treatment in others.

Definition of surrogate endpoint
A potential surrogate endpoint is a measure of
effect of a specific treatment that should correlate with
the real endpoint. It should also reliably anticipate the
effect of the treatment on the real endpoint; therefore,
it should be biologically associated with both the real
endpoint and the treatment. In any case, even if potential
surrogate endpoints fulfill all the above criteria, they
need to be appropriately (and prospectively) validated
before replacing the real endpoints. The validation of
a surrogate endpoint remains very challenging. As an
example, the role of pathological complete response
(pCR) as a surrogate endpoint for prediction of longterm clinical benefit in patients with breast cancer is still
largely debated. Even though patients with pCR have an
improved survival [7], a recent trial-based meta-regression
of randomized studies comparing different neoadjuvant
systemic treatments, showed that the therapeutic effect on
pCR accounts for only the 9% of the effect on long-term
prognosis [8].
As such, the observation that responding patients
live longer is not sufficient to establish that an increment
in the response rate always translates in an improved
survival.
The validation of a surrogate endpoint is both
disease- and treatment-specific and requires large
randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses of
randomized controlled trials. Of note, due to arithmetical
reasons, the effects of the treatment on the validated
endpoints are always greater than the effects on the real

As a consequence of the suboptimal role of PFS,
composite or alternative endpoints such as duration of
disease control or time to failure of the treatment strategy
have been recently proposed [19, 20]. For the time being,
however, the value of composite or alternative endpoints
is merely conceptual.

observed between the effects of the treatment on RR
and those on OS across different trials (meta-analytic
validation [13, 24]), RR can be safely accepted as
a surrogate primary endpoint in clinical trials [25].
The third aim represents an extension of the concept of
surrogacy since it implies that further benefits can be
obtained by prolonging the treatment.
Of note, the magnitude of clinical benefit not
only depends on the rate of response but also on disease
extension and anatomic location (e.g. visceral versus not
visceral responses [26]). Responding patients with liver
or lung metastases may have a greater clinical benefit
compared to responders with secondary nodal and bone
involvement [27, 28]. Therefore, it comes as no surprise
that the correlation between RR and OS tends to be weaker
in metastatic breast cancer, which is frequently associated
with bone, cutaneous or node metastases, compared with
the correlation observed in metastatic colorectal cancer,
which preferentially leads to visceral metastasis [28].
Overall, the relationship between OR and survival
in solid tumors and the potential role of response as a
surrogate of survival has great relevance. Nevertheless,
such issues have only been tackled in the last 15 years,
during which the methodological and statistical concerns
they involve have been addressed.

Objective response and response rate as
surrogate endpoints of overall survival
As every clinician would intuitively advocate,
it is reasonable to expect a better outcome in patients
who respond to treatment. Tumor response and clinical
benefit have always been considered closely associated
in most solid tumors, including advanced CRC [21].
This hypothesis was first confirmed by a meta-analysis
encompassing individual patient data from 3,791
metastatic CRC patients treated with fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy and enrolled in 25 randomized trials
[22]. The meta-analysis showed that tumor response was
a valid surrogate of the effect of fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy on survival, independently from other
clinical factors. However, the analysis also underlined
that a treatment lowering the odds of failure to respond
by 50% would be expected to decrease the odds of death
by only 6%, since the correlation was very low [22].
Considering all available randomized controlled trials
across different drug classes and lines of therapy, tumor
response should not be regarded as an acceptable surrogate
end point for OS [17].
The RR defines the proportion of patients with
tumor shrinkage of a predefined value and for a minimum
period of time. The RR is usually measured from the time
of initial response until documented tumor progression
and it directly reflects drug activity. It is typically used
as a primary endpoint in phase II trials, in which it
is sometimes coupled with the response duration. In
randomized phase III trials, RR is usually considered a
secondary endpoint.
Noteworthy, the objective response (OR) observed
in a patient can be used with 3 different aims:
a) as an indication that the tumor was sensitive to
the regimen administered;
b) as an indication of clinical benefit obtained
by the patient from the treatment in terms of
improved quality of life and, consequently, in
terms of prolonged life time;
c) as an indication that the treatment should be
continued because the patient is responding to it.
The first aim denotes the activity of the regimen,
and its associated statistics, the RR (i.e. the proportion of
responses) is commonly used to decide if that regimen
warrants further studies in patients with the same type
of tumor. The second aim qualifies OR as a potential
surrogate endpoint of survival. If its prognostic role is
shown to be independent of the treatment that induced
the response (Prentice criteria [23]) or a correlation is

Classical assessment of tumor response:
WHO and RECIST
Measuring the tumor response to a given treatment
is often challenging, although the problems may differ
from daily practice to clinical trials. In everyday clinical
practice, whether a treatment is deemed active or not is
based on several considerations, including subjective
judgment and arbitrary evaluations, more focused on
patient’s profile rather than on his/her metastatic lesions.
Conversely, in clinical trials objective and reproducible
criteria are required to assess and classify tumor response,
and usually the evaluation is based on the radiological
assessment of measurable/evaluable tumor lesions.
While in the historical World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria a bidimensional measurement of tumor
lesions was pursued [29], the Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria introduced the use of
unidimensional measures for overall evaluation of tumor
burden [30] (Table 1). In fact, based on the assumption
that the simple sum of the maximum diameters of
individual tumor is more linearly related to cell death
than the sum of the bidimensional products, the analysis
of data from 569 cancer patients have demonstrated that
the unidimensional measurement was a sufficient tool to
assess change in solid tumors [31]. Both the WHO and
RECIST criteria guidelines, conceived with the purpose
of creating a more objective, reproducible and comparable
tumor response assessment, were developed in the era of
cytotoxic agents. Subsequent versions of these criteria,
an effort to fine-tune the common language used by

researchers in a rapidly changing treatment landscape,
also had limitations. Although RECIST 1.1 criteria are
extensively applied in clinical trials [32], they suffer
from the significant inter-variability among readers [33],
the difficult evaluation of the margins of ill-defined or
irregular lesions, and the lack of objective evaluation of
non-measurable disease [34]. Moreover, RECIST criteria
do not consider the time dimension.

RECIST criteria cut-offs remain arbitrary, since
the 30% threshold in establishing reduction has no solid
anatomic or biological background and often requires
adaptation when measuring metabolic active lesions.
Furthermore, traditional RECIST criteria perform poorly
when evaluating the efficacy of cytostatic drugs, because
the real benefit is not captured from the variation of tumor
burden [35–37]. Additionally, specific target therapies
may induce increases in size in responding metastatic

lesions because of internal hemorrhage, necrosis or
myxoid degeneration [38], causing major interpretative
issues. Notable examples of this phenomenon have
been documented with the use of bevacizumab [39]
or regorafenib [40]. Accordingly, collaborative efforts
have already been made to evaluate more accurately the
morphological changes of the metastatic lesions [41, 42]
and to correlate the radiological changes with pathological
responses in those resected [40, 43].
The precise definition of pattern of response
has been further challenged with the introduction of
immunomodulatory molecules. Ipilimumab, for example,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

produces distinct patterns of response: regression of
baseline lesions with no new lesions, stable disease
followed by a slow, steady decline in tumor burden,
delayed response after an initial increase in tumor burden
and response after the appearance of new lesions. As for
the timing of tumor assessment, it is usually required at the
end of induction dosing period and at least 4 weeks later
(response confirmed) [44]. Ongoing trials testing PD-1/
PD-L1 inhibitors in gastrointestinal cancers [45] will most
certainly complicate the current landscape [46]. Notably,
immune-related response criteria are being used in trials
and clinical practice even if not prospectively validated yet.

Developments in the assessment of tumor
response: metabolic and biologic response

Hounsfield units (HU). According to these new criteria, a
decrease ≥10% in the sum of sizes together with a decrease
≥15% in the mean attenuation of target lesions measured
by CT with injection of contrast material accounts for a
partial response (PR), whereas progressive disease (PD)
is defined as a ≥ 10% increase in size not fulfilling the
PR criteria for density. However, both size and density
of liver lesions may be difficult to determine because
of devascularisation of the lesions during treatment,
especially in patients who underwent locoregional
treatment. The European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL) criteria take into account only the portion
of the lesion enhanced after injection during the arterial
phase (the viable portion) to assess the efficacy of focal
therapies. Recently, the combination of the RECIST
with the EASL criteria has led to the development of
the modified RECIST criteria, which evaluate only the
percentage change in the sum of the diameters of the
viable portions [58, 59].

To overcome some of the limits of the RECIST
criteria, functional [47, 48] or metabolic criteria, such
as the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Response
Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) [49] as well as
attenuation measurements reflecting tumor necrosis [43]
and measurement of the viable parts alone [50] have been
proposed.
Early changes in tumor metabolism have shown
to significantly predict long-term outcomes during
preoperative treatment of patients with liver metastases
from CRC [51]. In 33 patients treated with FOLFIRI
plus bevacizumab, between the first PET scan (obtained
before the beginning of treatment) and the second PET
scan (acquired after 1 cycle of chemotherapy in 31 patients
and after 2 cycles in 2) there was a notable decrease of all
the patient-based PET measures with a median change of
−33.9% (range, −78.3 to +54.0) for the highest SUV max.
After a median follow-up of 30 months, patients defined as
responders with PET outcome had significantly longer PFS
and OS than non-responders. Early response evaluated
by PET has shown to predict PFS and OS also in patients
with metastatic CRC receiving third-line cetuximab-based
therapy [52].
Standardization of methodology for PET-based
response evaluation is needed in order to compare results
achieved from different studies [53]. Recent studies have
suggested that an early assessment with PET/CT scan
for example as early as 2 weeks after chemotherapy, was
associated with the anatomic response and correlated with
survival. Such findings support further research to validate
the use of early PET response as a surrogate of long-term
outcome in patients with metastatic cancer [54].
Even though both RECIST and PERCIST criteria
seem to correlate with survival [55], the morphologic and
metabolic response agreement is poor [56].
Exploring similarities and differences between
metabolic and RECIST response might be a useful way
to implement understanding of tumor biology as well
as the treatment efficacy, especially after introduction
of new drugs such as bevacizumab and cetuximab. Of
note, differences were observed analyzing the correlation
between response rate and KRAS mutational status of
patients with metastatic CRC treated with irinotecan and
cetuximab. As a matter of fact, a large number of patients
harboring K-RAS mutation were found to have a metabolic
but not a clear morphologic treatment response, probably
due to a more sensitivity of PET/CT scan [54–56].
Since computer tomography (CT) scan enhancement
is related to the amount of blood perfusing the tumor, it
may be speculated that the attenuation in tumor density
observed during treatment can be attributed to tumor
devascularisation and necrosis. To evaluate the tumor
response, the Choi criteria [57] combine changes in
tumor size with the attenuation in density expressed in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

New response parameters: timing
It is reasonable to hypothesize an inverse
relationship between the time a tumor takes to shrink
when treated and its sensitivity to that specific treatment.
Moreover, it might be suggested that patients who respond
quickly to a treatment may experience better outcomes
than those with slower response or disease stabilization.
Although the evidence supporting such hypothesis is
scanty, the possibility that early tumor shrinkage (ETS)
becomes a new valuable parameter in clinical trials is
attractive.
This hypothesis has been already tested in the
breast cancer model. In the GeparTrio phase III study,
early tumor response was assessed after two cycles of
neoadjuvant treatment with docetaxel, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide. Overall, 22.2% of patients who
experienced an early response achieved pathological
complete response (pCR), compared with only 5.6%
of those who have no response after two cycles of
chemotherapy [60]. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of
7 neoadjuvant studies showed that response to the first 2 to
4 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy strongly correlated
with survival outcomes, especially in patients with high
aggressive tumors [61].
The definition of ETS, however, is not consistent
among different studies. Published data showed that
KRAS wild-type metastatic CRC patients who experienced
a relative decrease of tumor size >9.66% after 6 weeks
of cetuximab-based treatment had a significantly longer
median OS compared with all other patients (74.9 weeks
versus 30.6 weeks, p = 0.0000025); therefore, ETS might
be defined as the decrease in tumor size of at least 10% at
the very first radiological assessment since the beginning
of treatment [62].
To verify if faster tumor shrinkage may be used
as a prognostic factor, a retrospective analysis of 113
28721

Oncotarget

irinotecan-refractory patients enrolled in four clinical
trials (BOND, EVEREST, SALVAGE and BABEL) not
only showed that the decrease in tumor size was greater
in KRAS wild-type patients when compared to mutants
(mean relative change −13.73% versus +2.27%, p < 0.001),
but also that the rapid tumor shrinkage correlated with a
better outcome [62]. In particular, patients with a tumor
size decrease of at least 10% at the 6-week radiological
assessment had a median PFS of 36 weeks (95%CI
34.6–37.4) compared with 12 weeks (95%CI 22.9–39.7)
in patients who did not exhibit an early tumor response
( p < 0.001). Similarly, median OS was 65.9 weeks
(95%CI 41.3–90.4) in patients who had an early tumor
size reduction and 31.3 weeks (95%CI 22.9–39.7)
in those who did not. In the Cox regression analysis,
ETS was a strong predictor for survival (HR 0.42) [62].
In another retrospective study, radiological data of 329
patients enrolled in the BOND trial were reviewed to
verify if ETS of at least 10% correlated with RR and
survival parameters. In the univariate analysis an excellent
correlation between ETS and RR was reported ( p < 0.005).
Moreover, patients with ETS had a significantly longer TTP
(HR 0.22; 95%CI 0.17–0.32, p < 0.001) and longer median
OS (HR 0.24; 95%CI 0.20–0.43, p < 0.001). In multivariate
analysis, ETS was confirmed to be the strongest predictor
of TTP (HR 0.22, 95%CI 0.16–0.31, p < 0.001) and OS
(HR 0.21, 95%CI 0.14–0.32, p < 0.001) [63].
Similarly, a retrospective analysis of CRYSTAL
and OPUS trials showed a significant association
between ETS (in this case defined as an early shrinkage
of at least 20%) and PFS ( p = 0.027 for CRYSTAL
and p = 0.004 for OPUS), but not OS ( p = 0.573 and
p = 0.546, respectively) in patients exposed to cetuximab
[64]. It has been argued that the lack of association of
ETS with OS may be due to the crossover effect after
disease progression. In this analysis, tumor shrinkage was
more pronounced in KRAS wild-type patients receiving
chemotherapy plus cetuximab compared to those exposed
to chemotherapy alone. Moreover, ETS entailed longer
PFS in KRAS wild-type patients treated with cetuximab
compared to non-ETS (14.1 months vs. 7.3 months, HR
0.32, p < 0.001 in CRYSTAL; 11.9 months vs. 5.7 months,
HR 0.22, p < 0.001 in OPUS) and longer OS (30 months
vs. 18.6 months, HR 0.53 p < 0.01 in CRYSTAL; 26
months vs. 15.7 months, HR 0.43, p < 0.006 in OPUS).
Benefit derived from ETS was certainly smaller for
patients treated with irinotecan-based chemotherapy
alone and marginal for those treated with FOLFOX-4. In
summary, this retrospective analysis showed that early
tumor assessments might provide predictive information
for long-term outcome of metastatic CRC patients exposed
to first-line chemotherapy in combination with cetuximab.
Also, a different tumor volume algorithm was
developed to provide a better approximation of the real
tumor volume using both the longest and the longest
orthogonal diameters of a target lesion. Accordingly,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients treated with cetuximab plus either CAPIRI or
CAPOX who experienced at least 20% of tumor shrinkage
at 8 weeks had higher RR (82% versus 19%, p < 0.001),
longer median PFS (8.9 versus 4.7 months, p < 0.001)
and better OS (31.6 versus 15.8 months, p = 0.005) when
compared with non-responders [65]. Other confirmatory
analyses from trials enrolling metastatic CRC patients
treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy (FIRE-1,
CIOX, OPUS, and CRYSTAL trials) have been presented
[66]. Moreover, Mansmann and coll. demonstrated that
the tumor volume algorithm might be more accurate in
predicting individual patients’ PFS and OS than RECISTbased tumor assessments [67].
A large meta-analysis from the ARCAD database
including radiological data from 11,987 patients enrolled
on 15 randomized first-line phase III trials (with 8 trials
evaluating targeted therapies) assessed the correlation
between Early Objective Tumor Response (EOTR),
measured at 6, 8, or 12 weeks, and OS or PFS [68].
Median OS was significantly longer in patients with
EOTR at 6 weeks assessment compared to the others
(21.7 months versus 16.5 months, HR 0.64, 95%CI
0.58–0.70, p < 0.0001), regardless of the use of targeted
therapies (HR 0.68 versus HR 0.61). Accordingly, median
PFS was 8.4 months in patients with EOTR at 6 weeks
versus 7.0 months in patients without EOTR (HR 0.79,
95%CI 0.73–0.85, p < 0.0001). EOTR at 8 and 12 weeks
was also associated with longer survival outcomes. The
authors suggested that early response measured at 6, 8
or 12 weeks might be considered a strong independent
predictor for both OS and PFS.
The prognostic role of ETS when antiangiogenic
drugs are used upfront in combination with chemotherapy
has also been studied. In the TRIBE trial, 508 metastatic
CRC patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab
with either FOLFIRI or FOLFOXIRI for up to 12 cycles
[69]. Patients in the experimental arm achieved a
significantly longer PFS (12.1 months versus 9.7 months;
HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.64–0.93, p = 0.006) and a significant
increase in RR (65% versus 53%, p = 0.006). Recently,
441 patients were evaluated for ETS (shrinkage
cut-off  >20%) that was more frequently observed in
patients assigned to the FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab
arm (62.7% versus 51.9%, p = 0.025). Moreover, ETS
was associated with prolonged median PFS (17.1 months
versus 11.5 months, HR 0.65; 95%C, 0.49–0.86,
p = 0.030], and longer median OS [31.9 months versus
21.9 months, HR 0.63; 95%CI 0.48–0.83, p = 0.001] [70].
A pool-analysis of 21 trials including 16 phase III,
4 randomized phase II, and 1 non-randomized phase II
studies showed that patients with ETS had significantly
better outcomes in terms of PFS (HR 0.57, 95%CI
0.47–0.68, p < 0.001, heterogeneity I2 68%) and OS
(HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.53–0.64, p < 0.002, heterogeneity
I2 41%) compared with those patients with no ETS,
regardless of the biologic agent used in first-line treatment.

However, no correlation between ETS and OS was
found (R 0.37, 95%CI −0.31–0.78, p 0.28) and the
reliability of ETS as a potential surrogate endpoint was
not confirmed [71]. Recently, a secondary analysis of
a randomized trial investigating the role of cetuximab
combined with FOLFOX in 138 liver-limited KRAS
wild-type CRC patients [72] confirmed the impact of ETS
achieved at 8 weeks on clinical outcome [73].
In PEAK trial achievement of ≥ 30% versus < 30%
ETS at week 8 was associated with longer median PFS
(12.8 vs 9.7 months; HR: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.36–0.80];
p = 0.0019). Similar results were seen when combined data
were analyzed using the ≥20% ETS cut-off. Of note, more
patients treated with panitumumab versus bevacizumab
had ≥30% ETS at week 8 [74].
Data about the impact of ETS on PFS and OS in
patients exposed to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or
cetuximab are summarized in Table 2 [53–56, 61, 75, 76].
Although a number of studies suggest that ETS
has a potential value in CRC patients, the evaluation
of the prognostic role of ETS may be affected by at
least two methodological problems. Firstly, it is very

difficult to disentangle the role of ETS from the role of
response per se: if early responders are compared with
all remaining patients, the latter will include both late
responders and patients who never respond. Therefore, the
comparison should be limited to patients who eventually
respond, matching early complete responders to late
complete responders, and early partial responders to those
who experience a partial response later. However, it is
possible that some patients that partially respond early may
become complete responders at subsequent examinations,
further complicating the interpretation of the results.
Secondly, only comparisons strictly based on landmark
analyses are valid. In such analyses only the events
occurring after the last response assessment are considered.

New response parameters: extent
When using RECIST criteria, a tumor shrinkage that
exceeds 30% is defined as PR. In such scenario, both a
35% overall reduction in tumor size and a 95% decrease
of cancer burden would equally account for a response;
it is quite evident that RECIST criteria are not capable

of capturing the extent of tumor shrinkage, that might
be associated with a different prognosis. Deepness of
response (DoR) is another very interesting new measure
of activity used to explain the impact of different levels
of tumor shrinkage on survival. DoR, also called depth of
response, is defined as the percentage of tumor shrinkage,
in terms of longest diameter (LD) or calculated tumor
volume, observed at the nadir compared to baseline [77].
The deepest response point may occur anytime before
disease progression and does not need to be confirmed.
DoR may be intended as a continuous variable since the
tumor shrinkage may range from 0 to 100%. Alternatively,
DoR may be considered as an ordinal variable,
usually with five levels based on quintile distribution.
A comparison between DoR, ETS and objective response
characteristics is presented in Table 3.
From a clinical point of view, even if a maximal
tumor shrinkage is not the primary treatment purpose in
all cases of mCRC patients, a complete disease removal
after downsizing by chemotherapy may give the potential
of long-term survival or cure in potentially resectable
metastatic patients. Similarly, symptomatic patients
with aggressive or extensive disease may benefit from
a very active first-line treatment with a high likelihood
to induce disease regression in short time and produce
symptoms’ relief in patients presenting with greater tumor
burden. Conversely, older patients or those with major
comorbidities or with limited risk for rapid deterioration
may be considered for a less intense and forceful treatment
strategy. In advanced colorectal cancer setting, “the deeper
the response, the better the outcome” paradigm, although
intuitively acceptable, has not be fully substantiated. In
hematological diseases, a serum disease reduction of
> 90% is defined as a very good partial response (VGPR).
Extensive evidence supports the relationship between
achievements of VGPR after transplant with substantially
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prolonged survival in previously untreated myeloma
patients. This depth of response threshold not only has a
clear prognostic value [78, 79] but it also may be used as
a treatment guide [80]. The role of DoR as a predictor of
efficacy was first analyzed by revising radiologic data of
patients enrolled in CRYSTAL and OPUS trials. Results
supported a prognostic relationship between increased
DoR and longer survival post progression (PPS) in 841
patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic CRC treated
with oxaliplatin or irinotecan-based chemotherapy
regimens with or without cetuximab ( p < 0.0001 for
CRYSTAL and p < 0.005 for OPUS). In both trials,
the median DoR was higher in patients treated with
regimens containing cetuximab than in those treated with
chemotherapy alone (50.9% versus 33.3%, p < 0.0001 in
CRYSTAL; 57.9% versus 30.7%, p = 0.0008 in OPUS)
[77]. Data about DoR were recently reported also from
the PEAK study. Greater median DoR was observed with
mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab compared to mFOLFOX6
plus bevacizumab (65% [interquartile range {IQR}:
48–87%] vs 46% [IQR: 29–62%]; p = 0.0007) [74]. In the
TRIBE study, 484 out of 508 randomized patients were
evaluated to confirm whether DoR correlates with PFS and
OS. Although DoR was analyzed as a continuous variable,
the cut-off level used to determine a DoR was 38.9% and
corresponded to the median value of the tumor shrinkage.
DoR greater than 38.9% was more frequently observed in
patients assigned to the FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab
arm (58% versus 42%, p = 0.008). Moreover, a DoR
greater than the median value was associated with longer
PFS (13.1 months versus 9.3 months, HR 0.61, 95%CI
0.49–0.73, p < 0.0001] and OS [36.8 months versus 21.3
months; HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.35–0.58, p < 0.0001] [69].
These findings support the hypothesis that more profound
tumor shrinkage may have a positive impact on disease
outcome and may be a clinically relevant objective

independently from the conversion intent, delaying tumor
progression and eventually translating into significant
survival advantage. Recently, the importance of DoR has
been advocated to explain the results of FIRE-3 trial. In
this important phase III study, although RR and PFS were
similar in the two arms a significant survival increase was
unexpectedly reported in the group of patients assigned to
the cetuximab-containing arm [81]. A possible explanation
for this difference is provided by the Authors of the trial
themselves who propose a theoretical model in which
patients in the cetuximab arm have DoR greater than the
median value, thus requiring a longer period of time to
reach a lethal tumor burden (Figure 1). At present, the
possible relationship between DoR and tumor burden still
remains one of the major unsolved issue and this model
seems, at least in part, simplistic and questionable. Tumors
are a dynamic process composed of a heterogeneous
population of cells that are under continuous drug
selection pressure [82, 83]. In addition, this model
assumes that the tumor burden curves evolve similarly
after tumor progression in both treatment arms and does
not explain why median PFS values are not equally
modified. It is difficult to believe that factors such as the
impact of post-progression treatment, the development of
new lesions and patient’s existing or new comorbidities
do not influence post-progression survival [84]. DoR
evaluation inevitably depends on the time of tumor
assessment, and the exact nadir in terms of shrinkage
is unknown. Waterfall plots are vertical histograms in
which bars correspond to some degree of tumor growth
or shrinkage [85]. Waterfall plots are frequently used as
graphical illustrations to display the magnitude of each
individual patient’s response to a particular drug based on
a parameter, such as tumor burden. Although these graphic
models have rapidly garnered optimism because they may
simply and intuitively represent results for individual
patients, they are also subject to substantial variability,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

may be influenced by measurement errors, and should
be generated by experienced radiologist before being
interpreted in the context of clinical trials [86].

CONCLUSIONS
In this narrative review we have reported recent
data on the value of early tumor shrinkage and deepness
of response, and we have discussed how these response
measures have recently emerged as novel potential
surrogates in advanced stages of colorectal cancer.
Generally, patients with ETS achieve a rapid
decrease in tumor size at the very first radiological
assessment since commencing the treatment. DoR,
instead, is a measure of the width of the response,
which would enable to separate among patients
achieving response those with substantial tumor
shrinkage from those with smaller tumor burden
decrease. Similarly to objective response, ETS and
DoR have multiple potential applications. These novel
response parameters may indicate drug activity, may be
considered surrogate endpoints for survival in clinical
trials, may trace individual benefit in a single patient
or may serve as treatment guidance. ETS is evaluated
either as continuous or binary (≥20% vs <20%) variable
at a specific time-point. Similarly, DoR is considered
either as continuous or ordinal variable, with five
levels based on quintile distribution. Retrospective
radiological imaging review of patients enrolled in
phase III trials has suggested that these parameters may
correlate with improved clinical outcomes. Although
compelling, the actual role of ETS and DoR is yet to
be confirmed; moreover, since objective response, ETS
and DoR frequently include the same patients, it remains
uncertain whether their use might increase the objective
response surrogacy. Besides, their surrogacy with overall
survival should be further investigated within trials with

larger sample size and appropriate statistical analyses.
Interestingly, data from the TRIBE study suggested
that an early and more profound tumor shrinkage to
FOLFOXIRI and bevacizumab might consistently
correlate with both increased PFS and prolonged OS,
thus providing a springboard for future reasoning.
Although the evaluation of non-cytotoxic drugs may
complicate the scenario, these new parameters of
response deserve to be further studied as surrogate
endpoint in clinical trials, interim analyses of phase III
studies and trials with adaptive design.
