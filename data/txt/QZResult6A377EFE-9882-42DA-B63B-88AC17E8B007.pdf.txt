Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) suppress normal hematopoietic activity in part by
enabling a pathogenic inﬂammatory milieu in the bone marrow.
In this report, we show that elevation of angiopoietin-1 in
myelodysplastic CD34þ stem-like cells is associated with higher
risk disease and reduced overall survival in MDS and AML
patients. Increased angiopoietin-1 expression was associated with
a transcriptomic signature similar to known MDS/AML stem-like
cell proﬁles. In seeking a small-molecule inhibitor of this pathway, we discovered and validated pexmetinib (ARRY-614), an

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are generally incurable hematologic neoplasms
that are characterized by malignant clonal expansions in the bone
marrow. Because of the lack of curative conventional chemotherapies, there is a need to identify newer therapeutic agents that can
target malignant cell survival pathways. Most of the morbidity
and mortality experienced by these patients are due to low blood
counts (1). Cytopenias such as anemia, neutropenia, and throm1

inhibitor of the angiopoietin-1 receptor Tie-2, which was also
found to inhibit the proinﬂammatory kinase p38 MAPK (which
is overactivated in MDS). Pexmetinib inhibited leukemic proliferation, prevented activation of downstream effector kinases,
and abrogated the effects of TNFa on healthy hematopoietic
stem cells. Notably, treatment of primary MDS specimens with
this compound stimulated hematopoiesis. Our results provide
preclinical proof of concept for pexmetinib as a Tie-2/p38
MAPK dual inhibitor applicable to the treatment of MDS/AML.

bocytopenia lead to fatigue, immune deﬁciencies, and bleeding,
respectively, and are a major source of complications in this
patient population (2, 3). These cytopenias are in part due to
suppression of normal hematopoietic activity due to the inﬂammatory milieu that is seen in bone marrow. It has been shown that
various inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF, TGF, and IFNs are
overexpressed in the marrow microenvironment and lead to
suppression of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(HSPCs; ref. 4). Over the course of disease, the malignant cells that
are relatively resistant to these inﬂammatory myelosuppressive
cytokines expand, whereas the numbers of normal stem cell
clones gradually decrease. Thus, strategies to increase normal
hematopoietic activity would be useful in the resolution of
cytopenias experienced by patients with MDS and AML.
In this study, we have identiﬁed the angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1)/
TIE2 pathway as a novel therapeutic target in AML and MDS.
Angpt-1 is a cytokine that is implicated in vascular development
and angiogenesis and binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. In
murine studies, Tie2 has been shown to promote quiescence and
self-renewal in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC; ref. 5). HSCs
expressing Tie2 were shown to be quiescent and antiapoptotic,
and comprised a side-population of cells that adhered to osteoblasts in the bone marrow niche. Because leukemic cells and AML/
MDS–initiating stem cells are also associated with high rates of
self-renewal and associated with a differentiation block (6), we

investigated the role of Angpt-1/Tie2 pathway in these
malignancies.
We determined that Angpt-1 is overexpressed in MDS/AML
samples and that inhibition/knockdown of Tie2 can inhibit
leukemic proliferation and lead to enhanced hematopoietic
differentiation. We demonstrate the synthesis and validation of
a novel inhibitor of both Tie2 and p38 MAPK and show that
pexmetinib (ARRY-614) can lead to inhibition of malignant
cells while also reversing cytokine-induced suppression on
HSCs. The p38 MAPK is an evolutionary conserved serine–
threonine kinase, originally discovered as a stress-activated
kinase, that has now been shown to be involved in controlling
cell cycle or regulating apoptosis, with its effects being cell and
context speciﬁc (7). Our previous studies demonstrated that
myelosuppressive actions of TNFa, IFNs, and TGFb are regulated via activation of p38 MAPK (8–10). We demonstrated
that treatment of hematopoietic cells with small-molecule
inhibitors of p38 MAPK lead to a reversal of the growthinhibitory effects of these cytokines on hematopoietic cells.
These studies demonstrate the preclinical efﬁcacy of combined
inhibition of Tie2 and p38 MAPK by pexmetinib in MDS and
support ongoing efforts to test this in clinical trials in these
diseases.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples, cell lines, and reagents
Specimens were obtained from patients diagnosed with MDS
and AML after Institutional Review Board approval by the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The AML cell lines KG1
and CMK were obtained from ATCC and were grown in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cell line authentication was done by ATCC by short tandem
repeat proﬁling. ARRY-614 was obtained from Array BioPharma, dissolved in DMSO, and stored at 20 C at a concentration of 100 mmol/L.
Cell viability assay
Cell lines and primary samples were incubated at indicated
doses of TIE2/p38 inhibitor ARRY-614. Viability was assessed by
addition of CellTiter Blue (Promega) and measured via Fluostar
Omega Microplate reader (BMG Labtech).
siRNAs and nucleofection
For knockdown studies, siRNAs against TIE2 were purchased from Dharmacon. Nucleofection with AMAXA was
used for knockdown studies as performed previously (11).
Efﬁciency of Tie2 knockdown was measured by real-time PCR.
Clonogenic assays
For clonogenic assays, primary patient samples and healthy
controls were plated in methylcellulose (Stem Cell Technologies
H4435) in 35-mm dishes and incubated with the ARRY-614 at
indicated doses. Colonies were counted after 14 to 17 days in
culture. Clonogenic assays with siRNA-mediated Tie2 knockdown
were performed after nucelofection of primary human CD34þ
cells with speciﬁc siRNAs and controls, as in our previous studies
(8, 12). Hematopoietic cells were extracted for ﬂow cytometric
analysis by careful aspiration of the semi-liquid medium after 14
days. Cells from triplicate wells were pooled, washed three times
with ice-cold PBS, and stained with the following antibody-

ﬂuorophore conjugates: CD34–PE, CD45–PE-Cy7, CD14–PB,
CD11b–APC, glycophorin A–PE-Cy5, CD71–FITC.
Database and survival data
Gene expression data from 183 MDS CD34þ samples and 17
controls were obtained from GEO (GSE19429) (13). Data on 200
AML samples were obtained from TCGA (14). Multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazard testing was done using IPSS
scores as a variable for the MDS dataset. Multivariate analysis for
post day 200 survival using cytogenetics as a variable was done for
the AML TCGA dataset.
In vitro assays for determination of IC50
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and
HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells (ATCC) engineered
to express constitutively active Tie2 (HEK-Tie2) were used to
assess p38 and Tie2 phosphorylation in vitro. To create
HEK-Tie2 cells, a synthetic cDNA was generated (Blue Heron
Biotechnology) that directs the synthesis of a hybrid form of
the Tie2 receptor engineered to contain a FLAG epitope tag just
downstream of a prolactin signal peptide at the extreme amino
terminus of the polypeptide. In addition, this receptor construct was engineered with an arginine to tryptophan substitution at amino acid position 849, which confers constitutive
activation of the receptor. The cDNA was subcloned into the
retroviral vector pLNCX2 using the HindIII and NotI sites in the
polylinker and contains a doxycycline-inducible promoter.
HEK-Tie2 cells were treated with 1 mg/mL doxycycline 24 hours
prior to drug treatment to induce Tie2 expression, and
HUVECs were pretreated for 1 hour with 1 mg/mL anisomycin
or 0.1 mg/mL recombinant angpt-1 (R&D Systems #923-AN025) to activate p38 or Tie2, respectively. Cells were treated
with varying concentrations of pexmetinib for 2 hours (0.25%
BSA, 0.2% DMSO), lysed in RIPA buffer then subjected to
Western blot analysis. Effect on phosphorylation was detected
by near-infrared (NIR) ﬂuorescence using primary antibodies
directed to p-p38 (CST#9211s), pHsp27 (CST#2401s), pTie2
(CST#4226s), or pAkt (CST#4060) followed by infrared
labeled secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 680 donkey antirabbit (Invitrogen #A10043) or donkey anti-mouse IR800
(Rockland #610-732-124), normalized to GAPDH (Sigma
T6199) using LICOR Odyssey software. Data are presented
relative to DMSO-treated control.
Correction for protein binding
LPS-induced TNFa was determined in undiluted whole blood
(WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
matched donors (N ¼ 9 healthy human subjects). Blood was
collected by venipuncture into heparinized tubes (BD Biosciences, 367874) for Western blot samples and into cell preparation tubes (BD Biosciences, 362753) for PBMCs. PBMCs were
isolated according to manufacturer's directions and resuspended
at 1 million/mL in RPMI1640 supplemented with 2% heatinactivated FBS (HyClone). WB and PBMCs were preincubated
with varying concentrations of pexmetinib for 1 hour, 37 C, 5%
CO2 then stimulated with 100 ng/mL LPS (Escherichia coli K-235,
Sigma #L2018) for 16 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2. TNFa levels in the
cell-free supernatants were quantiﬁed by ELISA (R&D Systems,
DTA00C) as a measure of p-p38 inhibition.

Tie2 Inhibition in MDS and AML

In vivo assays for target inhibition of p-p38 and pTie2 in vivo
Na€ve male CD-1 mice (Charles River) or female nu/nu NCr
mice (Taconic Labs) inoculated with 5  106 HEK-Tie2 cells
subcutaneously near the axillary region on the right ﬂank were
utilized to assess the relationship between plasma concentration
and target inhibition in lung (p-p38) or tumor (p-p38 and pTie2).
To induce Tie2 expression in tumor-bearing animals, a single dose
of 30 mg/kg doxycycline in 5% sucrose was administered 16 hours
prior to administration of pexmetinib (amorphous-free base) as a
suspension in 1% CMC/0.02% SDS. All treatments were administered by oral gavage in a dosing volume of 10 mL/kg. At
predetermined time points, plasma was collected for analysis of
drug concentrations by LC/MS-MS and tissue (lung or tumor)
harvested for analysis of target inhibition by Western blot analysis. Lung and tumor tissue were homogenized (FastPrep) in RIPA
buffer then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Effect on phosphorylation was detected by NIR ﬂuorescence as above, normalized to GAPDH and data analyzed relative to vehicle-treated
control.

response to an inﬂammatory stimulus. A hallmark of this
response is production of TNFa, which is mediated by p38
pathway activation; thus, inhibition of TNFa provides a functional readout of p38 inhibition. Na€ve Swiss Webster mice were
orally administered increasing doses of pexmetinib as a single
agent 30 minutes prior to intraperitoneal challenge with 2 mg/kg
LPS (serotype 0127:B8; Sigma). Ninety minutes after LPS injection, WB was collected to process for serum and TNFa measured
by ELISA (#MTA00; R&D Systems).

Results
Angpt1 is overexpressed in MDS stem and progenitor cells and
is associated with worse prognosis in MDS and AML
We assessed the expression of angiopoietins in a large cohort of
MDS patient–derived bone marrow stem cells and compared it
with healthy controls. Angpt1 was found to be signiﬁcantly
overexpressed in MDS CD34þ HSPCs (n ¼ 183) when compared
with healthy controls (N ¼ 17; T-test, P < 0.05; Fig. 1A). In
addition, the receptor for Angpt1, Tie2, was also found to be
overexpressed in MDS HSPC samples when compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Because MDS is a heterogeneous collection of lowand high-risk disease subtypes, we next evaluated which pathologic subgroups had the highest expression of Angpt1. Angpt1

expression was found to be the highest in the refractory anemia
with excess of blasts (RAEB) subtype of MDS, that is associated
with the highest risk of transformation to AML (Fig. 1C; T-test, P <
0.05). Furthermore, when we divided the MDS cohort on the basis
of Apgpt1 expression using median expression value as a cutoff for
high and low expressors, we observed that percentage of leukemic
blast cells in the bone marrow was also signiﬁcantly higher in
patients with high Angpt1 expression (Fig. 1D; t test, P < 0.05).
Finally, we determined that high Angpt1 expressers had a significantly reduced overall survival with median survival of 2.6 years
versus 5.8 years for low expressers (log-rank P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 1E).
This association was signiﬁcant after multivariate analysis using
the IPSS score as a variable (P ¼ 0.004). In addition to MDS, we

also evaluated the relationship of overall survival with Angpt1
expression levels in a large AML cohort (TCGA, N ¼ 200; ref. 15).
Kaplan–Meier curves demonstrated reduced overall survival in
subjects with high Angpt1 expression (log-rank P ¼ 0.0009) that
was signiﬁcant after multivariate analysis using cytogenetics as a

Important functional pathways are dysregulated in MDS cases

Having demonstrated that MDS cases with higher Angpt1 in
HSPCs have a worse prognosis, we next wanted to determine
whether these cases also had a distinct molecular proﬁle. Gene

Knockdown of Tie2 inhibits proliferation in leukemic cells and leads to enhanced differentiation in healthy human CD34þ cells. A, speciﬁc knockdown of Tie2 with
two different siRNAs was achieved in leukemic KT-1 cell line as demonstrated by qRT-PCR (t test, P < 0.05). Proliferation of leukemic cells KT-1 and CMK was
assessed by MTT assay after transfection with TIE2 and control siRNAs. B, Tie2 knockdown led to decreased numbers of viable cells (t test, P < 0.05). C, speciﬁc
knockdown of TIE2 with siRNAs was achieved in primary healthy CD34þ cells as demonstrated by qRT-PCR (t test, P < 0.05). D, CD34þ cells transfected with
Tie2 and control siRNAs were grown in methylcellulose for 14 days and demonstrated increased erythroid colony formation (t test, P < 0.05). Colonies were
picked and analyzed for differentiation by multiparameter ﬂow cytometry. Increased erythroid differentiation was seen (higher glycophorin A positivity) after Tie2
knockdown. E, increased maturation of erythroid cells was also demonstrated (increased percentages of late erythroid) after speciﬁc knockdown of Tie2. Analysis of
myeloid and erythroid markers by FACS was performed on human CD34þ cells grown in methylcellulose colony assays. F and G, representative plots show increased
relative erythroid differentiation (glycophorin A positivity; F) and increase of mature erythroid cells (glycophorin A þve, CD71 ve; G) after TIE-2 knockdown.

low and high Angpt1 were compared and differentially
expressed transcripts were identiﬁed (FDR < 0.1; Supplementary Fig. S1A and Supplementary Table S1). We observed that
important functional pathways controlling cell cycle, hematopoiesis, cell signaling were selectively dysregulated in high
ANGPT-1 samples (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the gene signature
of high Angpt1 expressers was found to be signiﬁcantly similar
to known HSC and MDS/AML signatures (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Top three GSEA proﬁles that were similar to the
Angpt1-high gene signature included two stem cell signatures
and one related to the NUP98/HOX gene fusion that is seen
in MDS and AML (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 16). Next, we
tested whether the high Angpt-1 expression signature had
any overlap with known stem cell gene expression proﬁles.
Gene-set enrichment analysis with recently published preleukemic stem cell signatures (GSE10754 and GSE303774;
refs. 17, 18) revealed highly signiﬁcant enrichment, demonstrating that HSPCs from Angpt-1–high MDS patients have a
similar transcriptomic proﬁle to known leukemia-initiating
cell populations (Fig. 2B). Similarity to healthy stem cell

signature was also observed (Fig. 2B), suggesting that high
Angpt1 is associated with a distinct HSC-related molecular
signature characterized by dysregulation of many important
genetic pathways.
Knockdown of Tie2 inhibits proliferation in malignant
cells and leads to enhanced differentiation from healthy
human CD34þ cells
Because we saw overexpression of Angpt1 and its receptor
Tie2 in MDS/AML, we next wanted to assess the functional
signiﬁcance of this pathway in leukemic cells. Speciﬁc knockdown of Tie2 with siRNAs was achieved in leukemic cell lines
(Fig. 3A) and these cells were used for functional studies.
Proliferation of two different leukemic cell lines (KT-1 and
CMK) was assessed after transfection with Tie2 and control
siRNAs and demonstrated that Tie2 knockdown led to significantly decreased viability (Fig. 3B and C; t test, P < 0.05)
whereas no signiﬁcant inhibition was observed with knockdown of Angpt1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we wanted to
study the effects of Tie2 knockdown on normal human

primary healthy CD34þ cells (t test, P < 0.05; Fig. 3D) and
primary CD34þ stem cells transfected with Tie2 and control
siRNAs were grown in methylcellulose supplemented with
cytokines for 14 days. Increased erythroid colony formation
(blast forming unit- erythroid, BFU-E) was seen after Tie2
knockdown (t test, P < 0.05; Fig. 3E). Increased erythroid
differentiation was also demonstrated by FACS analysis done
on colonies that were selected and analyzed for erythroid
differentiation markers. We observed an increase in total percentage of erythroid cells (glycophorin A positivity; Fig. 3F),
along with increased maturation as evident by higher percentage of mature erythroid forms after Tie2 knockdown (Fig. 3G).
Discovery and synthesis of Tie2 inhibitor that also inhibits p38

A small-molecule orally bioavailable inhibitor of Tie2 was
synthesized (pexmetinib, ARRY-614) also known as 1-(3-(tertbutyl)-1-(p-tolyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3-(5-ﬂuoro-2-((1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)oxy)benzyl)urea (Fig. 4A; ref. 15). When
tested against a panel of 220 kinases, pexmetinib was found to be
highly potent against Tie2 and the p38 MAPK a and b (Fig. 4B). The
compound was also determined to be a type 2 kinase inhibitor that

4846 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

binds both p38 MAP kinase and Tie2 kinase in the "DFG-out"
conformation.
Next, we determined the efﬁcacy of inhibition using cell-based
systems including HUVEC stimulated with appropriate ligands
for p38 and Tie2 and HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells
(ATCC) engineered to express phosphorylated Tie2 (HEK-Tie2).
Cells were treated with varying concentrations of pexmetinib and
evaluated for efﬁcacy in inhibiting pTie2 and p-p38 MAPK directly
or proximally (e.g., pHsp27 for p38 or pAkt for Tie2). We
determined that pexmetinib was able to inhibit both kinases in
nanomolar ranges (Fig. 5A and B).
To predict the inhibition that could occur in clinical studies, it
was necessary to evaluate protein binding in human samples. To
do this, we used an LPS-stimulated TNFa production assay, which
provides a functional readout of p38 inhibition to provide an
accurate correction factor. WB and isolated PBMCs from matched
healthy subjects (N ¼ 9) were preincubated with varying concentrations of pexmetinib for 1 hour and then stimulated with
100 ng/mL LPS and assessed for TNFa levels. The IC50s for WB and
isolated PBMCs was 313  176 and 4.5  4.1 nmol/L, respectively, providing a human protein binding correction factor of
93X. On the basis of in vitro IC50 values corrected for protein
binding, the predicted plasma concentrations to achieve 50%

Tie2 Inhibition in MDS and AML

Figure 5.
Pexmetinib is a potent in vitro and in vivo inhibitor of p38 and Tie2. A, HEK-Tie2 cells express high basal levels of p-p38 and were induced to express
constitutively active pTie2 by 24-hour preincubation with doxycycline. After 2-hour treatment with varying concentrations of pexmetinib, samples were
immunoblotted for pTie2 and p-p38 then normalized to GAPDH. B, the IC50s for pTie2 and p-p38 inhibition in this mechanistic assay were 16 and 1 nmol/L,
respectively. Data were combined with results from other in vitro mechanistic models (Angpt-1 or anisomycin-stimulated HUVEC) as well as functional readouts
(LPS-induced TNFa release from human PBMCs) and corrected for human protein binding from HWB functional assays. C, the protein-corrected in vitro
IC50s were 2,282 and 172 nmol/L for Tie2 and p38, respectively. To test the prediction, in vivo IC50s were generated from mechanistic (Tie2 and p38 inhibition
in HEK-Tie2 xenografts) or functional (inhibition of LPS-induced TNFa release) murine models following a single oral dose of pexmetinib. D, the in vivo IC50s
were 2,066 nmol/L and 203 nmol/L for Tie2 and p38, respectively.

inhibition for pTie2 and p-p38 in human samples were 2,282 and
172 nmol/L, respectively.
Because of similar protein binding between mouse and human
plasma, we were able to test this prediction by performing murine
in vivo studies with HEK-Tie2 xenografts to assess the relationship
between plasma concentration and target inhibition in lung
(p-p38) or tumor (p-p38 and pTie2). Tie2 expression was induced
by doxycycline in tumor-bearing animals 16 hours prior to
administration of ARRY-614 (amorphous-free base) as a suspension in 1% CMC/0.02% SDS. At predetermined time points,
plasma was collected for analysis of drug concentrations by
LC/MS-MS and tissue (lung or tumor) harvested for analysis of
target inhibition by immunoblotting. In addition, we tested
functional inhibition of p-p38 by monitoring the inhibition of
LPS-induced TNFa in an in vivo model of endotoxemia. There was
good concordance between plasma concentrations required to
inhibit the p-p38 as assessed by immunoblotting and the functional readout of LPS-induced TNFa, so data for this target were
combined to generate an in vivo inhibitory value (Fig. 5C). We
determined that murine plasma concentrations required to
achieve 50% inhibition for pTie2 and p-p38 were 2,066 and

203 nmol/L, respectively, conﬁrming that our predictions from
protein binding–corrected in vitro inhibition were highly accurate.
ARRY-614 inhibits p38 MAPK, abrogates cytokine-mediated
myelosuppressive effects in hematopoietic cells, and can
stimulate MDS hematopoiesis
To determine the efﬁcacy of pexmetinib in human hematopoietic cells, leukemic KG1 cells were treated with TNFa
with and without pexmetinib for indicated times and immunoblotted for phospho/activated p38 MAPK. TNFa led to activation of p38 MAPK that was completely abrogated by pexmetinib
treatment (Fig. 6A). Downstream mediators of p38 MAPK,
MAPKAPK2, and EIF4E were also evaluated by immunoblotting
and pexmetinib was able to inhibit the activation of these
effector kinases after TNF exposure (Fig. 6B and C). To assess
the functional role of pexmetinib in human hematopoiesis,
primary CD34þ stem cells were grown in methylcellulose media
in the presence and absence of TNFa (5 ng/mL) and pexmetinib
(0.1 mmol/L). Erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-GM) colonies were assessed after 14 days and revealed that TNF
led myelosuppressive effects were signiﬁcantly reversed by

ARRY-614 abrogates cytokine-mediated myelosuppresive effects in hematopoietic cells, inhibits leukemic cell proliferation, and stimulates hematopoietic activity
in MDS. A, leukemic KG-1 cells were treated with TNFa (10 ng/mL) with and without ARRY-614 (10 mmol/L) for indicated times and immunoblotted for
phospho/activated p38 MAPK. B and C, downstream mediators of p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and EIF4E were also evaluated by immunoblotting. Human CD34þ cells
were grown in methylcellulose media in the presence and absence of TNFa (5 ng/mL) and ARRY-614 (0.1 mmol/L). Erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-GM)
colonies were assessed after 14 days. (N ¼ 4, t test). E and F, proliferation of leukemic cells KT-1 and KG-1 was assessed by MTT assay after treatment with
ARRY-614 (t test, P < 0.05). Primary MDS mononuclear cells (n ¼ 6) were grown in methylcellulose with and without ARRY-614. G, erythroid (BFU-E) and
myeloid (CFU-GM) colonies were evaluated after 14 days of culture. H, representative picture of colonies from one sample is shown.

pexmetinib treatment (Fig. 6D; N ¼ 4, t test, P < 0.05). Finally,
the effects of pexmetinib were assessed on leukemic cell proliferation and revealed the ability to signiﬁcantly inhibit proliferation in vitro for two different AML-derived cell lines (Fig. 6E and
F). Having established the efﬁcacy of pexmetinib in cell lines, we
next wanted to determine its effects on primary MDS samples.
Mononuclear cells were collected from ﬁve patients with a
variety of MDS subtypes (Supplementary Table S2). Treatment
with the pexmetinib resulted in an increase in erythroid (BFU-E)
and myeloid (CFU-GM) colony numbers in all the cases (Fig.
6G). An increase in the size of colonies was also seen demonstrating increased hematopoietic differentiation from these samples (Fig. 6F).

Discussion
MDS and AMLs are hematologic malignancies characterized
by malignant cell expansions coupled with ineffective hematopoiesis that results in reduced blood counts. We demonstrate
that the Angpt1/Tie2 pathway is overexpressed in MDS and is a
marker of adverse prognosis. We have also demonstrated previously that the p38 MAPK is overactivated in these diseases
and regulates the myelosuppressive effects of inhibitory cytokines in the marrow microenvironment. In this study, we have

4848 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

developed a novel clinically useful inhibitor of Tie2 that also
inhibits p38 MAPK. We demonstrate that combined blockade
of Tie2 and p38 MAP kinases by pexmetinib leads to inhibition
of malignant cell growth while stimulating hematopoietic
activity in MDS/AML cell lines and primary samples (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Our data implicate the Angpt1/Tie2 pathway as a novel
therapeutic target in AML and MDS. These myeloid malignancies are associated with disease-initiating stem cells that are not
eliminated by conventional therapies. We have demonstrated
that HSCs are aberrantly expanded in MDS/AML and can persist
during phenotypic remissions and can predict relapse. Because
approved therapies are frequently associated with refractory
and relapsed disease, novel therapeutic targets against such
preleukemic/MDS stem cells need to be identiﬁed for potentially curative strategies. Tie2 has been shown to regulate selfrenewal and promote symmetric cell division in murine healthy
HSCs (5) and our work also implicates this pathway in malignant myeloid neoplasms.
The p38 MAPK is also an attractive therapeutic target in MDS.
Although MDS can transform into leukemia, most of the morbidity experienced by these patients is due to chronically low
blood counts. Approved agents such as lenalidomide and conventional cytotoxic agents used to treat MDS have yielded some

Tie2 Inhibition in MDS and AML

encouraging results but are characterized by many adverse effects
including worsening cytopenias in the predominantly elderly
patient population. Thus, therapies aimed at reversing the bone
marrow failure and increasing the peripheral blood counts would
be advantageous in these patients. Our previous studies have
demonstrated overactivated signaling of p38 MAPK by myelosuppressive cytokines such as TNFa, TGFb, and interferons in
MDS HSCs (10, 19). Overactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway
promotes aberrant apoptosis of stem and progenitor cells in MDS
and leads to ineffective hematopoiesis. Thus, inhibition of p38
MAPK may be an attractive therapeutic strategy in combination
with an agent that targets malignant cell growth also. Our data
provide preclinical rationale for testing pexmetinib in trials in
MDS and AML.
