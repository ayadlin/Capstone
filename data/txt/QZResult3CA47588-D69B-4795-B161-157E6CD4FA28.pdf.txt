Abstract
The androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor belonging
to the family of nuclear receptors that mediate the action of
androgen. AR plays an important role in normal development
of the prostate, as well as in the progression of prostate cancer.
AR is regulated by several posttranslational modifications,
including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination.
In this study, we found that the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase
TRIM68, which is preferentially expressed in prostate cancer
cells, interacts with AR and enhances transcriptional activity of
the AR in the presence of dihydrotestosterone. We also found
that TRIM68 functionally interacts with TIP60 and p300, which
act as coactivators of AR, and synergizes in the transactivation
of AR. Overexpression of TRIM68 in prostate cancer cells
caused an increase in secretion of prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), one of the most reliable diagnostic markers for prostate
cancer, whereas knockdown of TRIM68 attenuated the secretion of PSA and inhibited cell growth and colony-forming
ability. Moreover, we showed that TRIM68 expression is significantly up-regulated in human prostate cancers compared
with the expression in adjacent normal tissues. These results
indicate that TRIM68 functions as a cofactor for AR-mediated
transcription and is likely to be a novel diagnostic tool and a
potentially therapeutic target for prostate cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy
and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in
the United States (1). Prostate cancer is a hormonally regulated
malignancy, and androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in
disease progression (2). One of the most troubling aspects of
prostate cancer progression is the conversion from an androgendependent state to an androgen ablation–resistant state, which,
at present, defies any effective treatment (3). In majority of endstage hormone-refractory tumors, AR continues to be expressed
and seems to be activated under androgen ablation conditions.
Elucidation of the mechanism of AR activation is essential for
understanding process of the prostate cancer progression and for
identifying possible targets for intervention (4). AR mediates
androgen action as a transcriptional factor in collaboration with a

number of coregulators. AR up-regulates or down-regulates target
gene expressions, depending on coactivators or corepressors (5, 6).
Furthermore, activities of AR and coregulators are regulated by
posttranslational modifications, such as methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (7–10). However, little is
known about the contribution of such processes to AR function.
Ubiquitination is a versatile posttranslational modification
mechanism used by eukaryotic cells. The ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway involves ubiquitin modification of substrates and sequential degradation by the proteasome (11). Ubiquitin conjugation
is catalyzed by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3; ref. 12). E3
is a scaffold protein that mediates between the ubiquitin-linked
E2 and the substrate. The resulting covalent ubiquitin ligations
form polyubiquitinated conjugates that are rapidly detected and
degraded by 26S proteasome (13). E3 is thought to be most directly
responsible for substrate recognition. E3 ubiquitin ligases thus
far identified include members of the homologous to E6-AP
carboxyl terminus (HECT), RING finger, and U-box protein families
(14–16).
TRIM68 is a member of the tripartite motif-containing protein
(TRIM) family defined by the presence of a common domain
structure composed of a RING finger, a B-box. and a coiled-coil
motif (17). In addition to these motifs, TRIM68 possesses a
carboxy-terminal PRY/SPRY domain. TRIM family proteins are
involved in a broad range of biological processes, and consistently,
their alterations result in diverse pathologic conditions, such as
genetic diseases, viral infection, and cancer development (18). It
has been reported that TRIM68 is one of the autoantigens associated with Sjögren’s syndrome and is a new diagnostic marker for
Sjögren’s syndrome (19). However, the function of TRIM68 has not
been elucidated. Recently, TRIM68 has also been shown to be
highly expressed in the prostate compared with its expression in
other normal tissues. TRIM21, which is structurally similar to
TRIM68 and is also one of the autoantigens associated with
Sjögren’s syndrome, has been found to bind DNA and has been
suggested to act as a transcription factor regulating gene expression (20, 21). TRIM21 has also been shown to be involved in cellular
proliferation and cell death (22). Given the highly prostate-specific
expression pattern of TRIM68 and the transcriptional function of
its related protein, we hypothesized that TRIM68 plays a role in
AR-dependent transcription.
In this study, we obtained evidence that TRIM68 is a novel ARinteracting protein and acts as a coactivator of AR, depending on
its ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous TRIM68 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) results in
suppression of the oncogenic properties of prostate cancer cells.
In addition, we found that TRIM68 is significantly up-regulated in
human prostate cancers, suggesting that TRIM68 is likely to be a
novel diagnostic tool for prostate cancer.

TRIM68 Regulates Androgen Receptor

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP-FGC, CWR22Rv1, and PC3
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. LNCaP and
CWR22Rv1 were maintained under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC in
RPMI 1640 (Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Life Technologies Bethesda Research Laboratories). PC3 and
HEK293T cell lines were cultured under the same conditions in DMEM
(Sigma) with 10% FBS.
Cloning of cDNAs and plasmid construction. Human TRIM68 cDNA
was amplified by PCR from HeLa cDNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). The
resulting fragment containing the human TRIM68 cDNA was ligated into
the pCR3 vector (Invitrogen) with a FLAG tag and into the pFastBacHT
vector (Invitrogen). Human AR cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Sobue
(Nagoya University). Deletion mutants of AR cDNA were generated by
PCR. Human TIP60 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Ikura (Tohoku
University).
Recombinant proteins, antibodies, and reagents. His-tagged TRIM68
was expressed in the Sf9 insect cell line using a baculovirus protein
expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant TRIM68 protein was used
as immunogen in rabbits. A rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIM68 antibody was
generated and then affinity-purified using a recombinant TRIM68-conjugated Sepharose 4B column. Other antibodies used were as follows: mouse
monoclonal anti-HA (HA.11/16B12, Covance Research Products), mouse
monoclonal anti-FLAG (M5, Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin
(P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti–prostate-specific
antigen (PSA; Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-AR (Santa Cruz), and
mouse monoclonal anti–a-tubulin (Zymed Laboratories). Dihydrotestosterone, dexamethasone, and 17h-estradiol were purchased from Sigma.
Ubiquitination assay. In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as
previously described (16). In brief, reaction mixtures containing 4 Ag of the
recombinant TRIM68 with 0.1 Ag recombinant E1 (Boston Biomedica), 1 Ag
recombinant E2s, 0.5 unit phosphocreatine kinase, 1 Ag ubiquitin (Sigma),
25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L ATP, 1 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.3 mmol/L DTT, and 1 mmol/L creatine phosphate were incubated
for 3 h at 30jC. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample
buffer containing 4% h-mercaptoethanol and heating at 95jC for 5 min.
Samples were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin and antiTRIM68 antibodies.
Transfection, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis.
HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After
48 h, the cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, leupeptin (10 Ag/mL),
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 Amol/L Na3VO4, 400 Amol/L
EDTA, 10 mmol/L NaF, and 10 mmol/L sodium PPi. The cell lysates were
centrifuged at 16,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and the resulting supernatant
was incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4jC. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia) that had been equilibrated with the same solution was
added to the mixture, and then the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4jC. The
resin was separated by centrifugation, washed five times with ice-cold lysis
buffer, and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis was
performed with primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Promega), and an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia).
Establishment of stable transfectants by using a retrovirus
expression system. Complementary DNAs were subcloned into pMX-puro
(kindly provided by T. Kitamura, Tokyo University), the resulting vectors
were used to transfect Plat A cells, and then recombinant retroviruses were
generated (23). LNCaP cells were infected with the recombinant retroviruses
and selected in medium containing puromycin (2 Ag/mL; Sigma).
RNAi. The pMX-puro II vector in which the U3 portion of the 3¶ long
terminal repeat was deleted was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kamura (Nagoya
University; ref. 24). The hairpin sequences specific for human TRIM68
mRNAs corresponded to nucleotides 329 to 349 (siTRIM68-1) and 796 to
816 (siTRIM68-2) of the respective coding regions. The hairpin sequences
specific for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP; Clontech) mRNA were
used as a control. Recombinant retroviruses were generated and used to

www.aacrjournals.org

infect LNCaP cells as described above. After selection in medium containing
puromycin (2 Ag/mL), the resulting cell lines were checked by immunoblot
analysis with anti-TRIM68 antibody.
Dual-luciferase assay. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1  105 per
well (LNCaP) or 5  104 per well (PC3 and CWR22Rv1) and incubated at
37jC with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase
(MMTV-Luc) reporter plasmid and the pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid
(Promega) were transfected with the TRIM68 expression vector into LNCaP
and CWR22Rv1 cells or with the AR expression vector into PC3 cells using
Fugene HD reagent (Roche). Estrogen-response element reporter plasmid
(ERE-Luc) was used for the estrogen receptor (ER)–luciferase assay.
Transfected cells were incubated in 10% charcoal–treated FBS (EquitechBio) medium for 48 h and then washed and treated with or without
10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone for 24 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
The luminescence was quantified with a luminometer (Promega).
PSA expression and secretion assays. LNCaP cell lines were seeded in
six-well plates and incubated in 10% charcoal–treated FBS medium for
48 h and then washed and treated with or without 10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone for 24 h. The cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting
with anti-PSA antibody. Cell culture media were collected and assayed for
PSA concentration by ELISA analysis using a TOSOH II PA monoclonal
immunoenzyme assay kit.
Cell proliferation assay. LNCaP cell lines were incubated in 10%
charcoal–treated FBS medium for 48 h and then plated into 96-well plates
at 5,000 per well in 100 AL medium. Cells were treated with 10 nmol/L
dihydrotestosterone and refed with fresh medium containing dihydrotestosterone every 2 d. MTS cell proliferation assay was performed using
CellTiter 96 one solution (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Colony formation assay in soft agar. LNCaP cells were plated at a
density of 1  104 cells in 60-mm dishes containing 0.4% top low-melting
agarose and 0.5% bottom low-melting agarose medium. Colonies with a
diameter of >0.1 mm were counted after 3 wk.
Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA
(3 Ag) isolated from various cell lines, human prostate cancers, and adjacent
normal tissues with the use of TRI Reagent (Sigma) was subjected to reverse
transcription with MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resulting
cDNA was subjected to real-time quantitative PCR by TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The assays were performed with a TRIM68-specific TaqMan probe and
primers (synthesized by Applied Biosystems) in an ABI-PRISM 7000
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). TATA box-binding protein (TBP) was selected as an internal control to normalize the expression
levels. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Human tissue samples. Tissues from 35 cases of primary prostate
cancer were surgically resected by radical prostatectomy. Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient before surgery. The excised
samples from tumor and adjacent normal tissues were obtained within
1 h after the operation. All excised tissues were immediately placed in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 80jC until further analysis. Samples were then
manually microdissected from frozen sections on microscope and histologically confirmed to be highly homogeneous cancer tissues by H&E staining
of step sections.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde
for 3 d and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded sections (3-Am
thick) were mounted on silane-treated slides. After drying overnight at
37jC, paraffin was removed from the sections with xylene, and they were
then rehydrated with a graded series of ethanol solutions. The tissues were
then subjected to immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to
TRIM68 (5 Ag/mL) by a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method
using an immunohistochemical detection kit (Vectastain Elite; Vector) and
diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (Wako) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively classified. Two
independent investigators reviewed and scored slides observed under a
microscope by categorizing staining intensity of characteristic staining cells
as negative, weak, medium, or strong (scored as 0–3). The final score was

obtained by multiplying the percentage of positive cells by the intensity
score with an estimated score range of 0 to 300.
Statistical analysis. We used the unpaired Student’s t test and the
Mann-Whitney U test to determine statistical significance of experimental
data.

Results
TRIM68 has a ubiquitin ligase activity and is predominantly
expressed in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. TRIM68 has a
RING finger domain at its NH2 terminus and belongs to the TRIM
family of proteins, some of which have been reported to be E3
ubiquitin ligases (18). To determine whether TRIM68 actually
mediates an E3 ligase activity, we generated recombinant TRIM68
protein by using a baculovirus expression system and performed an
in vitro ubiquitination assays with various combinations. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody revealed that
TRIM68 exhibits ubiquitination activity only in the presence of E1,
E2 (Ubc4), ubiquitin, ATP, and TRIM68 (Fig. 1A, top). The lack of
any of these components prevented autoubiquitination of TRIM68.
In addition, an in vitro ubiquitination assay using anti-TRIM68
antibody showed that TRIM68 has an autoubiquitination activity
(Fig. 1A, bottom). These findings indicate that TRIM68 is a bona
fide E3 ligase. To further investigate the region of TRIM68 responsible for ubiquitination, we generated a deletion mutant lacking a
RING finger domain (DRING) of TRIM68 and then performed an
in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 1B). The in vitro ubiquitination
assay showed that the deletion mutant has no E3 ligase activity,
indicating that the RING finger domain is indispensable for E3
ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM68.
To study the expression profile of TRIM68, we measured TRIM68
mRNA levels in various human cell lines of different origins by

using real-time quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR).
The gene expression of TRIM68 was found predominantly in the
prostate cancer cell line LNCaP compared with its expression in
other cell lines, including the prostate cancer cell lines CWR22Rv1
and PC3, B-cell lymphoma cell line Namalwa, embryonic kidney
cell line 293, breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7, uterine
epithelial carcinoma cell line HeLa, neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y, and hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (Fig. 1C). Next,
we compared the protein levels of TRIM68 by immunoblotting in
hormone-related cancer cell lines, including LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC3,
T47D, and MCF7. Consistent with the observed mRNA expression
pattern, TRIM68 protein was found to be abundantly expressed in
the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP compared with its expression
in other cell lines (Fig. 1D).
Interaction between TRIM68 and AR. Given that TRIM68 is
highly expressed in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell
line LNCaP, we hypothesized that TRIM68 is associated with
prostate cancer and particularly the AR signaling pathway. To
test the possibility, we verified interaction between endogenous
TRIM68 and AR in LNCaP cells by immunoprecipitation using
antibodies to TRIM68 and AR (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, to determine the domain of AR that interacts with TRIM68, deletion
mutants of AR were constructed for in vivo binding assays
(Fig. 2B). HA-tagged AR mutants and FLAG-tagged TRIM68 were
expressed in HEK293T cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to
immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The results
showed that AR-L, including the ligand-binding domain, was
coprecipitated with TRIM68 but AR-ND, including the aminoterminal domain and DNA-binding domain, was not, suggesting
that the ligand-binding domain is responsible for interaction with
TRIM68 (Fig. 2C).

immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Whole-cell lysates were also subjected to immunoblotting to confirm the expression of AR derivatives and
TRIM68. *, IgG heavy chain. D, interaction of TRIM68 with AR in the nucleus is enhanced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT ) treatment. LNCaP cells were incubated in 10%
charcoal–treated FBS medium for 48 h and then treated with or without 10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone for 24 h. Subcellular fractions were separated biochemically,
and then nuclear fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-AR antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-TRIM68 and anti-AR antibodies. Irrelevant IgG
was used as a control. A portion of the nuclear extracts corresponding to 3% of the input for immunoprecipitation was also subjected to immunoblotting to confirm the
expression levels of endogenous TRIM68 and AR in the nucleus.

Next, to confirm subcellular colocalization of TRIM68 and AR in
the nucleus, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay using
nuclear fractions of LNCaP cells treated or not treated with
dihydrotestosterone. The immunoprecipitation assay showed that
the nuclear interaction of TRIM68 with AR was enhanced by
dihydrotestosterone treatment, suggesting that TRIM68 serves as a
coregulator for androgen-dependent transcription (Fig. 2D).
TRIM68 enhances AR-mediated transcriptional activity.
Having shown coprecipitation and colocalization of TRIM68 and
AR, we next examined whether TRIM68 functionally affects ARmediated transcription. To examine the effect of TRIM68 on
AR-mediated transcriptional activity, we performed a luciferase
reporter assay using an MMTV promoter-driven luciferase construct (MMTV-Luc). A TRIM68 expression vector and MMTV-Luc
were transfected into LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, and luciferase
assays were then performed with and without dihydrotestosterone.
The luciferase assays showed that TRIM68 enhances androgendependent AR-mediated transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent
manner, whereas TRIM68DRING mutant, which lacks ubiquitin
ligase activity, showed a dominant negative effect, suggesting that
TRIM68 acts as a positive regulator for AR signaling and that
ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM68 is indispensable for AR transactivation (Fig. 3A).
To confirm the physiologic role of TRIM68 in AR-mediated
transcription, we used RNAi to knockdown endogenous TRIM68 in
LNCaP cells. Two different short interference RNAs (siRNA)
targeting TRIM68 were introduced into LNCaP cells by using a
retroviral infection system. RNAi treatment resulted in significant
silencing of TRIM68 at protein level in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B, left). To
examine the effect of the depletion of TRIM68 on AR-mediated
transcription, we performed a relative luciferase assay for AR signal
in LNCaP cells transfected with TRIM68 siRNA. The relative

www.aacrjournals.org

luciferase activities of cells transfected with TRIM68 siRNA were
decreased compared with those of cells transfected with the
control siRNA (Fig. 3B, right).
To determine whether the effect of TRIM68 is specific to ARmediated transcription, we transfected expression vectors encoding TRIM68 and wild-type AR, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or ER
into the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC3 and
performed luciferase reporter assays using each reporter system for
AR, GR, and ER. Luciferase assays showed that TRIM68 markedly
enhances AR-mediated transcription in PC3 cells transfected with
AR, whereas TRIM68 enhances GR-mediated transcription to a
lesser degree and has no effect on ER-mediated transcription
(Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that TRIM68 is a comparatively
specific coactivator for AR.
It has been reported that ubiquitin modification of substrates
and the sequential degradation by the proteasome is involved in
transcription activity of AR (25). To determine whether proteasome
activity is required for TRIM68-mediated transcriptional activity of
AR, we performed a luciferase assay for AR transactivation in the
presence or absence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. TRIM68
enhanced AR transactivation in the absence of MG132, whereas the
effect of TRIM68 was dramatically suppressed in the presence of
MG132, indicating that the proteasome activity is required for the
effect of TRIM68 on AR transcriptional activity (Fig. 3D).
TRIM68 cooperates with TIP60 and p300 to enhance ARmediated transcriptional activity. The activity of AR is regulated
by several posttranslational modifications. Previous studies have
shown that AR and coregulators are regulated by histone acetyltransferases, such as TIP60 and p300, to enhance AR transcriptional activity (9, 26). Therefore, we hypothesized that TRIM68
physically or functionally interacts with TIP60. To determine
whether TRIM68 physically interacts with TIP60, expression

vectors encoding FLAG-tagged TRIM68 and HA-tagged TIP60 were
transfected into HEK293T cells. The cell lysates were subjected to
immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, and then immunoblot
analysis was performed using anti-FLAG antibody. An in vivo

binding assay showed that TRIM68 specifically interacts with TIP60
(Fig. 4A). To further determine whether TRIM68 functionally
interacts with TIP60, we performed an AR transactivation assay.

Two different siRNAs targeting TRIM68 (siTRIM68-1 or siTRIM68-2) or targeting GFP (siGFP, used as a control) were introduced into LNCaP cells by a retrovirus
expression system. Knocked-down LNCaP cell lines with siTRIM68 were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-TRIM68 and anti–a-tubulin (an internal control)
antibodies (left). Knocked-down LNCaP cell lines with siTRIM68 were transfected with MMTV-Luc reporter vector. Cells were incubated in 10% charcoal–treated

vector. Transfected cells were incubated in 10% charcoal–treated FBS medium for 48 h and then treated with or without a cognate ligand (10 nmol/L
dihydrotestosterone, 10 nmol/L dexamethasone, or 10 nmol/L 17h-estradiol) for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Relative

TRIM68 Regulates Androgen Receptor

Figure 4. TRIM68 cooperates with TIP60 and p300 to enhance AR-mediated
transactivation. A, physical interaction between TRIM68 and TIP60.
Expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged TRIM68 and HA-tagged TIP60 were
transfected into HEK293T cells as indicated. After 48 h, cells were lysed
and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by
immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. Whole-cell lysates were
also subjected to immunoblotting to confirm the expression of TRIM68 and TIP60
(right ). B, TRIM68 cooperates with TIP60 or p300 to enhance AR-mediated
transactivation. LNCaP cells were cotransfected with expression vectors
encoding TIP60, p300, and TRIM68 with MMTV-Luc as a reporter. Transfected
cells were incubated in 10% charcoal–treated FBS medium for 48 h and then
treated with or without 10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone for 24 h. The cells were
then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Relative luciferase activities of
cells that had been transfected with an empty vector and then treated with
dihydrotestosterone were defined as 1. Columns, mean of values from three
independent experiments; bars, SD. *, statistically significant based on attaining
P’s of <0.05 (unpaired Student’s t test).

TIP60 and/or TRIM68 with MMTV-Luc as a reporter and treated
with dihydrotestosterone, and then luciferase assays were performed. TIP60 and TRIM68 individually enhanced AR-mediated
transactivation with dihydrotestosterone treatment, and the combination of TIP60 and TRIM68 markedly enhanced AR-mediated
transcriptional activity (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the combination of
another coactivator, p300, and TRIM68 also enhanced AR-mediated
transcriptional activity (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that
TRIM68 cooperates with coactivators, including TIP60 and p300,
for AR-mediated transactivation.
Effects of TRIM68 on the expression and secretion of PSA.
PSA is a secretory glycoprotein that acts as a serine protease and
exists exclusively in prostate epithelial cells (27). Serum PSA level is
usually increased in patients with prostate cancer (28). Because the
PSA gene contains an androgen-responsive element (ARE) and its
transcriptional level is regulated by AR, we hypothesized that
TRIM68 also affects the expression of PSA. LNCaP cells, which

www.aacrjournals.org

express AR and secrete PSA, were used for the PSA expression
and secretion assays. LNCaP cells stably expressing TRIM68 or
TRIM68DRING by a retroviral expression system were treated with
or without dihydrotestosterone, and then cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PSA antibody (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, cell culture supernatants were collected and assayed
for PSA concentration by ELISA analysis (Fig. 5B). TRIM68
increased both the expression and secretion of PSA by treatment
with dihydrotestosterone, whereas TRIM68DRING did not. To
confirm the relationship between TRIM68 and PSA production, we
used LNCaP cells transfected with TRIM68 siRNA and analyzed
the expression and secretion levels of PSA. Knockdown of TRIM68
decreased both the expression and secretion of PSA in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 5C and D). These findings suggest that TRIM68 contributes to
the expression and secretion of PSA in prostate cancer cells.
TRIM68 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer. Given
that TRIM68 modulates AR-mediated transcription, we hypothesized that TRIM68 affects androgen-dependent cell growth. An
MTS cell proliferation assay was performed to examine the effects
of TRIM68 on cell growth. Knockdown of TRIM68 significantly
inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells, whereas overexpression of
TRIM68 slightly increased the growth of LNCaP cells (Fig. 6A).
These results suggest that TRIM68 has a significant effect on the
androgen-dependent growth of LNCaP cells.
To examine the effect of TRIM68 on oncogenic phenotype in prostate cancer cells, we performed an anchorage-independent colony
formation assay in soft agar. Overexpression of TRIM68 marginally
increased colony-forming rate, whereas knockdown of TRIM68 significantly inhibited colony formation of LNCaP cells, indicating that
TRIM68 has a significant effect on the oncogenic properties of prostate cancer cells (Fig. 6B). These findings may indicate that TRIM68
is required for oncogenic properties of prostate cancer cells but is not
sufficient to enhance oncogenic phenotypes (Fig. 6A and B).
Considering the involvement of TRIM68 in prostate cancer cell
proliferation and PSA production, we hypothesized that TRIM68 is
aberrantly expressed in human prostate cancers. TRIM68 mRNA
levels of 35 cases of human prostate cancer and adjacent normal
tissue, which were surgically resected by radical prostatectomy in
patients with primary prostate cancer, were quantified by real-time
quantitative RT-PCR. TBP was selected as an internal control to
normalize the expression levels, because there are no known retropseudogenes for it and TBP is not differentially expressed in tumor
and normal prostate tissues (29, 30). Relative mRNA levels of
TRIM68 were significantly increased in the majority of human
prostate cancers compared with the levels in normal prostate
tissues (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05; Fig. 6C). These results
indicate that TRIM68 gene expression is up-regulated in human
prostate cancer.
Next, to examine the protein expression levels of TRIM68 in
human prostate cancers, prostate cancer tissues and adjacent
normal tissues simultaneously obtained from radical prostatectomy in patients with primary prostate cancer were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry using anti-TRIM68 antibody. TRIM68
staining in tissues was detected mainly in the nucleus of epithelial
cells, as observed in LNCaP cells treated with dihydrotestosterone.
TRIM68-expressing cells were more abundant in cancer tissues
than in normal tissues (Fig. 6D, a–f ). TRIM68 expression in the
benign sample group was low or absent (mean staining score, 91).
In cancer samples, on the other hand, TRIM68 exhibited mainly a
moderate or high level of expression (mean staining score, 220),
indicating that TRIM68 immunoreactivity was significantly higher

in cancer tissues than in benign tissues (Fig. 6D, g ). These findings
indicate that TRIM68 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer
and may serve as a significant marker protein for prostate cancer.

Discussion
Recent advances have indicated that AR-mediated transactivation is regulated by posttranslational modification, including
phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Ubiquitination
involves degradation of AR and coregulators, and ubiquitination
also has a nonproteolytic role in transcription (10). E3 ubiquitin
ligases should play an important role in the regulation of ARmediated transcriptional activity. However, only a few E3 ligases for
AR, coactivators, or corepressors have been identified.
Recently, AR NH2 terminal–interacting protein, also known as
p53-induced protein with a RING-H2 domain (PIRH2), has been
reported to interact with histone deacetylace 1 and promote its
degradation (31). In addition, E6-AP, a HECT type ubiquitin ligase,
has been shown to enhance the hormone-dependent transcriptional activity of AR (32). The coactivating function may result
from the ability of E6-AP to target nuclear receptor corepressor
(NcoR) for degradation (33). However, PIRH2 and E6-AP do not
display tissue-specific expression in prostate, and the effects are
not restricted to the regulation of AR activity.
The present study is the first study to provide evidence that
TRIM68, which is preferentially expressed in prostate cancer cells,

is a novel AR-interacting protein and acts as a coactivator of AR
depending on its ubiquitin ligase activity. TRIM68 possesses E3
ubiquitin ligase activity in collaboration with E2, including Ubc4
and UbcH5. TRIM68 physically associates with AR and enhances
the transcriptional potential of AR. Interaction of TRIM68 with
AR in the nucleus was further enhanced by dihydrotestosterone
treatment, indicating that TRIM68 behaves as a coregulator that
assembles into an AR-associated transcription factor complex.
Overexpression of TRIM68 enhanced AR-mediated transactivation
in various prostate cancer cell lines, whereas knockdown of
TRIM68 gene expression using RNAi caused suppression of ARmediated transactivation. These findings indicate that TRIM68 is
an intrinsic cofactor for AR activation in prostate cancer cells.
It has been reported that regulation of AR activity by ubiquitination is divided into two roles: a proteolytic role of AR and its
coregulators linked to proteasome machinery and a nonproteolytic
role without proteasome machinery (34, 35). We showed that the
proteasome activity is also required for the effect of TRIM68 on
AR-mediated transactivation. Therefore, coactivating function of
TRIM68 may be involved in the proteolytic role for AR or ARassociated proteins. However, TRIM68 could not directly ubiquitinate AR (data not shown). Hence, TRIM68 may ubiquitinate one
of the corepressors for AR-mediated transcription.
Cyclical recruitment of transcriptional coregulators is now an
established phenomenon that is intrinsic to transcriptional
activation by steroid receptors (36). However, few molecules that

Figure 6. TRIM68 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer. A, TRIM68 affects prostate cancer cell growth. LNCaP cell lines stably expressing TRIM68,
an empty vector (mock), siTRIM68, or siGFP were incubated in 10% charcoal–treated FBS medium for 48 h and then plated in 96-well plates (5,000 per well). Cells were
treated with 10 nmol/L dihydrotestosterone and refed with fresh medium containing dihydrotestosterone every 2 d. Relative cell number was assayed at various

identified. We showed that TRIM68 is associated with TIP60 and
p300, which act as coactivators of AR, and cooperates in enhancing
AR-mediated transcriptional activity. This raises the possibility that
TRIM68 assembles into an AR complex with coactivators, such as

TIP60 and p300, and ubiquitinate corepressors, leading to exchange
of corepressors for coactivators after ligand binding.
The PSA gene is known to contain an ARE, and its transcriptional level is regulated by AR and coregulators, including
TIP60 (37). We showed that TRIM68 increases both expression and

secretion of PSA in LNCaP cells, whereas knockdown of TRIM68
decreases both expression and secretion of PSA. Furthermore, we
showed that knockdown of TRIM68 significantly attenuates prostate cancer cell growth. These findings imply that TRIM68 does
play an important role in AR transcriptional complexes that regulate gene expression, including expression of the PSA gene, or in
cell proliferation.
We showed that TRIM68 is predominantly expressed in LNCaP
cells among various human cell lines, including sex hormone–
related prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Thus, we speculate
that effects of TRIM68 are restricted in prostate cancer cells and
are particularly involved in AR-mediated transcription. Furthermore, we showed by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative RT-PCR that TRIM68 expression is significantly up-regulated
in the majority of primary human prostate cancers compared with
its expression in adjacent normal prostate tissues. As observed in
LNCaP cells with dihydrotestosterone treatment, TRIM68 staining
was dominantly detected by immunohistochemistry in the nuclear
compartment in human prostate cancer tissues compared with the
staining in adjacent normal prostate tissues. These results indicate
the possibility that TRIM68 is a potential regulator for prostate
carcinogenesis and cancer development.
It has been reported that autoantibodies to TRIM68 are
frequently found in the sera of patients with Sjögren’s syndrome

(19). However, the clinical significance of these autoantibodies in
human cancers has not been investigated. Considering the overexpression of TRIM68 in prostate cancers, autoantibodies to TRIM68
may be found in the sera of patients with prostate cancer and could
be used as an additional diagnostic tool for prostate cancer.
We showed that TRIM68 is a positive modulator of transcriptional activity of AR. We suggest that ubiquitination activity of
TRIM68 regulates the functions of AR or corepressors critically
involved in proliferation, differentiation, or oncogenesis of prostate
epithelial cells. Thus, it is probably important to identify physiologic substrates of TRIM68 and pharmacologic inhibitors of
AR-associated ubiquitin ligases, including TRIM68 for establishing
novel therapeutic tools for advanced hormone refractory and
metastatic prostate cancer.
