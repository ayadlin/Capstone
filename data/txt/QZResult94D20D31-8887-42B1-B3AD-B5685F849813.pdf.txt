ABSTRACT
EGFR-targeted therapy is a key treatment approach in patients with RAS wildtype
metastatic colorectal cancers (CRC). Still, also RAS wildtype CRC may be resistant
to EGFR-targeted therapy, with few predictive markers available for improved
stratification of patients. Here, we investigated response of 7 CRC cell lines (Caco2, DLD1, HCT116, HT29, LS174T, RKO, SW480) to Cetuximab and correlated this to
NGS-based mutation profiles, EGFR promoter methylation and EGFR expression status
as well as to E-cadherin expression. Moreover, tissue specimens of primary and/or
recurrent tumors as well as liver and/or lung metastases of 25 CRC patients having
received Cetuximab and/or Panitumumab were examined for the same molecular
markers. In vitro and in situ analyses showed that EGFR promoter methylation and
EGFR expression as well as the MSI and or CIMP-type status did not guide treatment
responses. In fact, EGFR-targeted treatment responses were also observed in RAS exon
2 p.G13 mutated CRC cell lines or CRC cases and were further linked to PIK3CA exon
9 mutations. In contrast, non-response to EGFR-targeted treatment was associated
with ATM mutations and low E-cadherin expression. Moreover, down-regulation of
E-cadherin by siRNA in otherwise Cetuximab responding E-cadherin positive cells
abrogated their response. Hence, we here identify ATM and E-cadherin expression as
potential novel supportive predictive markers for EGFR-targeted therapy.

therapeutic option [2]. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), namely Cetuximab and Panitumumab, have been
approved for the metastatic situation. These therapeutic
mAbs bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR and
inhibit downstream signaling of the RAS/MAPK and
PI3K/AKT pathways, which promote (cancer) cell
proliferation, survival and growth. Resistance to EGFRtargeting mAbs exists in CRC patients, whose tumors
harbor an EGFR downstream activating KRAS or NRAS

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both
men and women [1]. Although death rates are declining
due to early detection programs, improved treatment
strategies for metastatic CRC are still emerging. Surgical
resection and/or chemotherapy based on capecitabine,
irinotecan, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin and
targeting drugs like bevacizumab are a current standard

mutation. Hence, RAS mutation testing is a routine
diagnostic molecular pathology pre-requisite for clinical
decision making on EGFR-targeted therapy, as laid out in
clinical guidelines [3]. Still, 40-60% of CRC patients with
RAS wild type tumors do not benefit from EGFR-targeted
mAbs [4] and predictive markers for this subgroup of
CRC patients are lacking. Since EGFR-targeted therapy is
mostly in combination with chemotherapy (e.g. FOLFOX
treatment regimen), not only EGFR-associated, but also
other cellular signaling pathways and processes may
confer resistance and define novel predictive markers.
Indeed, predictive markers further to RAS were
first suggested to be found within the EGFR downstream
signaling pathways, including alterations of - for example
- BRAF, PIK3CA and PTEN [5, 6]. Of these, PIK3CA
and associated kinases - as key regulators of the PI3K/
AKT pathway - are highly attractive predictive and, in
fact, also potentially actionable candidates: PIK3CA is a
proto-oncogene encoding phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), the signal inducer of the PI3K-AKT pathway and
is mutated in about 10-30% of CRC, mostly in sequence
hotspots in exons 9 and 20 [7, 8]. It is predictive for
inhibition by combined Dabrafenib/Trametinib treatment
[9] and is itself targetable by novel agents.
Nevertheless, predictive markers for CRC
patients scheduled for or undergoing EGFR-targeted
(chemotherapy-combined) therapy may also reside within
the cellular mechanisms of cell damage. As such, ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a serine/threonine protein
kinase belonging to the PI3K family. It functions as a key
mediator of DNA damage response and induces cell cycle
arrest [10]. Furthermore, inhibitors against ATM are in
preclinical development and a radiosensitizing effect
was reported, particularly in cells defective in p53 [11].
Both, ATM and TP53 are frequently mutated in cancers
of the colon and rectum [12], but their predictive value
for RAS wildtype CRC patients treated by EGFR-targeted
therapy in combination with chemotherapy still has to be
elucidated.
Irrespective of these “downstream” mechanisms of
treatment resistance and potential predictive markers, few
studies have (re-)evaluated alterations within the actual
target structure - EGFR - and/or its altered expression
or functionality. Hence, in contrast to the prediction of
treatment responses to HER2-targeted mAb therapy in
breast cancer [13], EGFR protein expression analysis
or its regulation at the DNA level are not in the focus of
treatment prediction of response to EGFR-targeted therapy
in CRC patients. Moreover, the role of crosstalk of EGFR
with other cellular pathways and/or induced EGFR bypass signaling via e.g. other membrane receptors [14]
remains unclear.
With the increasing knowledge about epigenetic
regulation of cancers, methylation of CpG sites within
promoter regions may be an attractive monitor of gene
repression and protein expression [15]. So far, few studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have addressed the role of EGFR methylation status as a
predictive marker for EGFR-targeted treatment responses
beyond the key predictive markers addressing gene
mutations and yielded conflicting results: Scartozzi [16]
described a better overall survival in patients without
EGFR promoter methylation, whereas Chiadini [17]
reported an improved response and overall survival in
patients with ≥10% EGFR methylation.
Protein expression and/or activity of EGFR thereby also response to EGFR-targeted therapies - may
also be regulated by other means, for example E-cadherin:
E-cadherin is a transmembrane protein, playing a role
in cell adhesion and the maintenance of epithelial cell
integrity, which is altered upon metastasis [18]. E-cadherin
is known to be lost in epithelial cancers during epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis [19],
such as in CRC [20] and non-small-cell lung cancers [21].
Interestingly, in an experimental model system, soluble
E-cadherin was induced by MMP9 activity and - in its
soluble form – was able to actually activate EGFR [22].
Thus, the observed “loss” of E-cadherin - as detected by
immunohistochemistry in most studies so far - may in
fact indicate the induction of a soluble E-cadherin form,
which interacts with and activates EGFR, thereby possibly
leading to treatment resistance. Indeed, correlation of
E-cadherin protein expression in CRC [23, 24], NSCLC
[25] and urothelial [26] cancer cells with response to
EGFR-targeted therapy showed that E-cadherin “loss”
(with possible induction of soluble E-cadherin) points
towards EGFR-targeted treatment resistance.
In the present study, we therefore assessed broad
mutation profiles, EGFR methylation and expression as
well as E-cadherin expression as predictive markers in
7 CRC cell lines treated by EGFR-targeted mAb in vitro
as well as in a cohort of 25 clinically RAS wildtype
CRC patients having been treated by EGFR-targeted
therapy. We identify mutations in DNA damage response
associated genes and E-cadherin expression as potential
supportive predictive markers for EGFR-targeted therapy
of RAS wildtype CRC.

RESULTS
Sensitivity of CRC cell lines to Cetuximab
To establish in vitro correlates for EGFR-targeted
therapy responses observed in CRC patients, we first
measured the effect of Cetuximab on cell viability of
seven colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. Of these, 3/7
cell lines are KRAS and NRAS wild type (Caco-2, HT29
and RKO) and 4/7 cell lines are KRAS mutated (DLD1,
HCT116, LS174T and SW480). In addition, 3/7 cell lines
are microsatellite stable (Caco-2, HT29, SW480) and 4/7
are microsatellite instable (DLD1, HCT116, LS174T,
RKO) [27]. For further molecular classification, CpG

revealed CIMP positivity for 4/7 cell lines (DLD1,
HCT116, HT29 and RKO) and CIMP negativity for 3/7
cell lines (Caco-2, LS174T and SW480).
As expected for mAb-based treatment in vitro, mere
incubation of CRC cells with different concentrations of
Cetuximab (0.1, 1, 10, 50 and 100 μg/ml) had almost no
effect on cell viability in any of the investigated CRC cell
lines. In this setting, the strongest response was a 20% loss
of cell viability in exclusively LS174T cells (Figure 1A).
We therefore next investigated the response of the
seven CRC cell lines to Cetuximab by antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [28, 29]. Indeed, upon coculture with increasing numbers of effector cells, three
distinct patterns of response to Cetuximab were observed
in the seven CRC cell lines (Figure 1B): Cetuximab was

most effective in DLD1 cells, followed by intermediate
responses in HT29, HCT116, LS174T and Caco-2 cells,
whereas RKO and SW480 cells were non-responsive to
Cetuximab treatment at all effector-target ratios. Thereby,
the cell line responses to Cetuximab were not directly
linked to RAS mutation status, with responding cells
either being RAS mutated (DLD1, HCT116, LS147T)
or not (Caco-2, HT29). Vice-versa, non-responding cells
were either RAS mutated (SW480) or not (RKO).
Hence, the selected CRC cell lines are a model for
EGFR-targeted treatment by mAbs in vitro and - as seen in
CRC patients - their RAS mutation status does not appear
to be the single predictive marker for treatment response
to EGFR-targeted mAb therapy.

Distinct mutation profiles occur in Cetuximab
responding and non-responding CRC cell lines

Hence, in addition to RAS status also EGFR
expression, closely regulated by DNA promoter
methylation in Caco-2 cells, does not directly guide the
responses of CRC cell lines to Cetuximab.

Screening for 46 additional genes to KRAS and
NRAS by targeted next generation sequencing next defined
additional oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes
related to the observed Cetuximab responses in vitro.
The number of mutated genes in the 7 cell lines
ranged from 4 (Caco-2) to 10 (DLD1) (Supplementary
Figure 1A). No significant mutation pattern correlating
with the cell lines’ response or non-response to Cetuximab
was detected. However, the resistant cell lines RKO
and SW480 both harbored an ATM mutation and no
mutations in those genes affected in the responding
and intermediate responding CRC cell lines (HNF1A,
SMAD4, SMO, ABL, CTNNB1, IDH1, NOTCH1,
STK11) (Supplementary Figure 1B). In addition, PIK3CA
exon 9 mutations (p.E545K, p.D549N) were detected
exclusively in responding DLD1 cells, whereas a PIK3CA
exon 20 mutation (p.H1047R) was present in intermediate
responding HCT116 and LS174T as well as in nonresponding RKO cell (Table 1).
Finally, all cell lines were screened for the recently
described EGFR exon 12 resistance mutation p.S492R,
described as occurring during EGFR-treatment [30] by
dideoxy sequencing. However, none of the cell lines was
positive for this mutation at base-line (Supplementary
Figure 1C).
Thus, broader mutation profiles or the number of
mutations does not alone define response of CRC cells to
Cetuximab in vitro.

E-cadherin protein expression differs in
Cetuximab responding and non-responding CRC
cell lines
Based on the hypothesis that E-cadherin expression
may influence EGFR-targeted treatment responses [24–
26], we next examined E-cadherin protein expression in
all seven CRC cell lines.
As seen by immunofluorescence staining using two
E-cadherin antibodies (Figure 3A), strong membranous
and in part cytoplasmic E-Cadherin was detectable in
DLD1 cells. HT29 and LS174T cells also showed marked
fully circular membranous E-cadherin expression, whilst
in Caco-2 and HCT116 E-cadherin expression was in part
non-membranous and more cytoplasmic in cells without
other cell contacts. In RKO and SW480 cells, weak
E-cadherin expression was seen. In the latter two cell
lines with weak E-cadherin expression as detected by the
first antibody (clone NCH-38, DakoCytomation/Agilent,
recognizes the 120 kD mature form and a 82kD (soluble)
fragment of E-cadherin), the second antibody (clone
24E10, Cell Signaling Technology, raised against P780 of
E-cadherin and stains cytoplasmic E-cadherin) revealed a
stronger E-cadherin expression, but predominantly in the
cytoplasm. The levels of E-cadherin protein expression
were confirmed by western blot analyses using the second
antibody, showing lower E-cadherin protein levels in
RKO and SW480 (Figure 3B). Moreover, whilst DLD1,
HCT116, LS174T and Caco-2 cells expressed both the
mature (120kDa) and immature (130kDa) E-cadherin
protein, this was not the case for HCT116, RKO and
SW480 cells.
To investigate soluble levels of E-cadherin, cell
culture supernatants of the 7 cell lines were additionally
examined by ELISA at 48 and 72 hours (Figure 3C).
Thereby, low levels of soluble E-cadherin were detected
in RKO and SW480 cells, whilst moderate soluble
E-cadherin levels with a slight increase at 72 hours of
cultivation were seen in ascending order in HCT116,
DLD1, HT29, Caco-2 and LS174T cells.
To further validate that E-cadherin levels have
an impact on the response of CRC cells to Cetuximab,
DLD1 exhibiting strong E-cadherin protein expression
were subjected to control- and E-cadherin-specific
siRNA treatment followed by analysis of antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 4A,
E-cadherin protein levels were down-regulated post 72h
of E-cadherin-specific siRNA treatment, particularly
regarding the loss of the 120kDa mature E-cadherin.
Moreover, in DLD1 cells treated by E-cadherin-specific
siRNA and Cetuximab, the cell cytotoxicity via ADCC

Regulation of EGFR expression by EGFR
promoter methylation
To correlate in vitro Cetuximab treatment responses
to potential alterations of the target structure, i.e. EGFR
itself, EGFR mRNA and protein expression as well as
EGFR promoter methylation were assessed in all seven
CRC cell lines (Figure 2).
Immunofluorescence revealed strong membranous
EGFR protein expression only in Caco-2 cells (Figure 2A).
Marginal, mainly cytoplasmic EGFR protein expression
was observed in HT29, LS174T and DLD1 cells, whereas
the HCT116, RKO and SW480 cells were EGFR negative.
These EGFR protein expression patterns correlated to
EGFR mRNA expression, which was highest in Caco-2
(13.21±3.85) cells, followed by HT29 (2.47±0.23), LS174T
(1.60±0.20), DLD1 (1.45±0.28), HCT116 (0.97±0.28), RKO
(0.34±0.04) and SW480 (0.04±0.02) cells (Figure 2B).
Finally, epigenetic regulation of EGFR expression
[31] was examined by EGFR promoter methylation
analysis via pyrosequencing. EGFR promoter methylation
was lowest in the strong EGFR expressing Caco-2 cells
(6.3%) and higher (range 60%-81%) in all other CRC cell
lines (Figure 2C).

The cohort of colorectal cancer patients
receiving EGFR-targeted therapy

was impaired by 2- to 5-fold as compared to DLD1 cells
treated by Cetuximab alone (Figure 4B). DLD1 cells
treated with E-cadherin-siRNA alone did not show any
significant cell cytotoxicity.
These data point towards a potential important role
of E-cadherin in response to Cetuximab in CRC cell lines,
since strong or weak membranous expression is associated
with responding or non-responding CRC cell lines and
since down-regulation of E-cadherin in responding DLD1
cells abrogates response to Cetuximab.

To translate the in vitro findings into a clinicopathological situation, a cohort of 25 CRC patients was
next investigated (Table 2). This included tissue specimen
based analyses of primary tumors in 24/25 (96%) and a
recurrent tumor in 1/25 (4%) of CRC cases as well as
further case-matched analysis of recurrent tumors (n=2,
derived from 2/25 CRC cases) and distant liver or lung

metastases (n=20, derived from 12/25 CRC cases). All
CRC patients had received EGFR-targeted therapy (n=13
Cetuximab; n=7 Panitumumab; n=5 Cetuximab and
Panitumumab). This was combined with chemotherapy
in 22/25 (88%) of cases. In three cases (#5, 15, 19)
EGFR-targeted therapy was given prior to resection of
the primary tumor (#5), recurrent tumor (#19) or liver
metastasis (#15). According to the guidelines for initially
only KRAS exon 2 and in recent years entire RAS [32]
testing, all cases were wildtype for all 25 CRC cases
at the time of clinical presentation. Diagnostic reports
(external: 2/25; internal: 23/25) of KRAS exon 2 or RAS
status were based on dideoxy sequencing in 24/25 CRC
cases and on next generation sequencing in 1/25 CRC
cases. For further molecular classification, microsatellite
instability (MSI) and CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP, Supplementary Figure 2) status was defined for
the 25 CRC cases. This revealed 1/25 (4%) MSI-positive
and 2/25 (8%) CIMP-positive CRC cases, with 1/25 (4%)
being MSI- and CIMP-positive. All clinico-pathological
(including clinical response criteria such as complete or
partial response, stable or progressive disease, survival)
and molecular (MSI, CIMP) data are given in Table 2.

tissue specimens from CRC patients treated by EGFRtargeted therapy.
First, the mutational load showed inter- and intrapatient variability (Figure 5A): The number of mutations
ranged from n=2 to n=97 mutations in 24 primary
tumors and 3 recurrent tumors at time of initial clinical
presentation, and from n=1 to n=86 mutations in 20 liver or
lung metastases. In case-matched metastases, the mutational
load was either maintained (1/12; 8.3% cases), increased
(6/12; 50% cases) or decreased (5/12; 41.7% cases).
Second, the most frequently mutated genes in all 47
analyzed tissue specimens were TP53 and APC, followed
by mutations in ATM, SMAD4, KDR, ErBB4, FBXW7
and others, including KRAS, NRAS and HRAS (Figure
5B). Focusing on genes coding for receptor tyrosine
kinases (including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2,
FGFR3, PDGFRA, KDR/”VEGFR”) and associated
genes of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways the
evaluation revealed mutations in EGFR in 25.5%, KRAS
in 38.3%, BRAF in 21.3%, PI3KCA in 27.7%, AKT in
10.6% and PTEN in 21.3.% of cases (Figure 6A). Of
these, all detected mutations in EGFR affect tyrosine
kinase domains or ligand binding domains and were found
widely distributed over EGFR exons 3,7,15,18,19,21
(Supplementary Table 1A). Since the recently described
EGFR exon 12 p.G465 and p.S492 Cetuximab resistance
mutations, described as occurring during EGFR-treatment
[33], were not covered by tNGS, these were further
determined by dideoxy sequencing. Neither EGFR exon
12 p.G465 nor p.S492 were mutated in the 25 CRC cases.
However, a known single-nucleotide polymorphism was
detected in EGFR intron 12/13 (dbSNP: rs1558544) in
7/25 CRC cases.
Finally, mutation profiles in EGFR signaling
pathways were analyzed in a case-specific manner
(Figure 6B; Supplementary Table 2): Within primary/
recurrent tumors, exclusive receptor tyrosine kinase or
RAS/MAPK mutations were observed in 6/25 (24%)
or 4/25 (16%) of cases, respectively. In contrast,
exclusive PI3K/AKT mutations were not detectable
in primary/recurrent tumors, whereby mostly PIK3CA
exon 9 and 20 mutations (Supplementary Figure 3,
Supplementary Table 3) were seen in combination
with other alterations. In 9/25 (36%) primary/recurrent
tumors, mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases, RAS/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT were present. In this setting,
the receptor tyrosine kinases, RAS/MAPK and PI3K/
AKT mutation profiles detected in the primary/recurrent
tumors diverged upon metastasis in 9/12 (75%) of
cases. Case-matched liver or lung metastases carried
only receptor tyrosine kinase or RAS/MAPK mutations
in 4/12 (16%) of cases and presented with mutations in
receptor tyrosine kinases, RAS/MAPK and PIK3CA/
AKT in 4/12 (16%) of cases.
These data show that complex mutation profiles may
influence the response to EGFR-targeted therapy in CRC
and possibly also the associated combination therapies.

RAS mutation profiling by targeted next
generation sequencing
To obtain a comprehensive and full picture of the
RAS status of CRC cases treated by EGFR-targeted
therapy at times when only KRAS exon 2 testing
was required, we performed targeted next generation
sequencing (tNGS), including all 24 primary tumors, 3
recurrent tumors and 20 distant liver or lung metastases.
The tNGS data underlines the necessity for
comprehensive RAS testing in CRCs. In total, 32 KRAS,
11 NRAS and 5 HRAS sequence variants were detected
in the 47 tissue specimens of the CRC cohort. Thereby,
8/25 CRC cases presented with RAS “hotspot” mutations,
which were maintained for case-matched tissue specimens
upon disease progression. These RAS mutations were
either in KRAS exon 2 previously undetected by dideoxy
sequencing (case #2), in NRAS exon 2 (case #1), in
KRAS/NRAS exon 3 (cases #7, #14, #16, #21, #23), in
HRAS exon 2 (case #22), or were other KRAS/NRAS
sequence variants documented in COSMIC without known
therapeutic relevance so far (case #2) (Table 3).
Hence, broader RAS testing and more sensitive
technologies, such as tNGS, improve detection of possible
K/N/HRAS resistance mutations for EGFR-targeted therapy.

Broad mutation profiling reveals a high
frequency of mutations in receptor tyrosine
kinases and genes of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/
AKT pathways
In addition to RAS mutations, tNGS sequencing
revealed novel insights into the mutation profile of the 47

Note that at time of treatment decision making and predictive testing, only KRAS exon 2 testing was performed, i.e.
not including KRAS codons 58 (case #16) and 61 (cases #7, #14, #21, #23) or NRAS exon 2 (case #1). For case #2,
dideoxy sequencing at that time did not detect the KRAS exon 2 mutation. HRAS testing (case #22) is still not included in
diagnostic RAS testing guidelines.

EGFR expression and EGFR promoter
methylation in CRC

Finally, EGFR protein expression was positive
(score >/=1) in 3/25 (12%) cases (#9, #16, #25). Case #9
only showed an EGFR expression of score 1 in one lung
metastasis; case #16 only showed an EGFR expression of
score 1 in the primary tumor; case #25 showed an EGFR
expression of score 3 for the primary tumor and one lung
metastasis (Figure 7). Further to this, EGFR expression was
heterogeneous resulting in a score of 0, but showing focal
EGFR membranous positive tumor cells even within the
same tumor glands (Figure 7, cases #8, #9).
Hence, indeed CRC rarely express high levels
of membranous EGFR protein, which are not directly
regulated by EGFR promoter methylation and mRNA
expression (Supplementary Figure 4).

To test whether in vitro observed EGFR expression
and its regulation by DNA methylation is also seen in
situ, EGFR promoter methylation, mRNA and protein
expression were analyzed in 24 primary tumors, 3
recurrent tumors and 17 distant liver or lung metastases.
(Figure 7, Table 4). EGFR promoter methylation analysis
was omitted from the 3 metastatic lesions of case #25,
which showed high EGFR mRNA and protein expression
due to an EGFR gene amplification.
As assessed by pyrosequencing of 3 CpG sites,
EGFR promoter methylation ranged from 3% to 64.3%
in primary tumors and from 1.3% to 56.3% in metastases
(Table 4).
The relative EGFR mRNA expression was generally
low upon comparison to a universal reference RNA (fold
change primary/recurrent tumors: 0.008 to 8.039; fold
change liver or lung metastases: 0 to 4.708). One case
(#25, gene amplification) showed a 78-fold increase of
EGFR mRNA expression in the primary tumor and an up
to 127-fold increase in the metastasis (Table 4).

E-cadherin protein expression correlates to

metastases for E-cadherin protein expression (Figure 8,
Table 5). As for the in vitro experiments above, this was
performed with two commercially available antibodies:
The first antibody (clone NCH-38, DakoCytomation/
Agilent) recognizes the 120 kD mature form and a 82kD
(soluble) fragment of E-cadherin. The second antibody
(clone 24E10, Cell Signaling Technology) recognizes
P780 of E-cadherin and stains cytoplasmic E-cadherin.
Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that
E-cadherin was expressed in all 25 CRC cases, with
E-cadherin expression in normal epithelia being high

(IRS score 12) in 15/25 cases and low (IRS score range
2 to 8) in 10/25 cases. E-cadherin protein expression
was mostly maintained in case-matched primary tumors
and metastases, except in three cases (#16, #17, #20)
with either higher (#17, #20) or lower (#16) IRS scores
for E-cadherin expression in metastases. Indeed, in 4/25
cases, primary tumors (#15, #20, #22) and liver (#15, #16)
metastases showed heterogeneous E-cadherin expression
as defined by the number of positive tumor cells (i.e.
scored for category “51-80%” positivity) (Table 5). There
was no case with complete E-cadherin negativity and

A matrix for response prediction to EGFRtargeted therapy in CRC

both used antibodies showed similar expression patterns
(Figure 8A). Nevertheless, in a single case with low
E-cadherin expression (#11, primary tumor), membranous
staining appeared to be more prominent by antibody 2 as
compared to antibody 1 (Figure 8A). Since entire tissue
specimen sections were used for immunohistochemical
staining, artefacts due to non-representative selected tissue
areas can be ruled out.
Finally, upon classification of primary tumors of
cases with clinical follow-up (n=17) into “E-cadherin
score <12” (n=8) versus “E-cadherin score=12” (n=9),
the median overall survival of E-cadherin strong positive
cases was better than in those cases with lower E-cadherin
expression (Figure 8B).

Of the generated data, RAS status, BRAF, PIK3CA,
ATM mutations as well as E-cadherin expression appeared
to correlate with responses of CRC cell lines and cases
to EGFR-targeted therapy. In order to provide a synopsis
of their predictive value, CRC cell lines and cases were
defined as responders, intermediate responders and nonresponders followed by integration of the key alterations
investigated. The classification was by the ADCC data
for cell lines (Figure 1) and by known clinical response
parameters of “partial/complete response”, “stable/
progressive disease” and survival data for CRC cases
(Table 2).

DISCUSSION

As depicted in Table 6 for primary tumors, the
MSI and CIMP status as well as EGFR expression are
not of predictive value in the present cohort. Similarly,
RAS mutations were actually present in responders,
intermediate responders and non-responders. The same
is true for BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in general.
However, when specifying PIK3CA mutations, the
responding cell line (DLD1) and CRC patients (#3, #8)
harbored the same PIK3CA exon 9 mutations, whereas
intermediate responders and non-responders carried the
same PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (HCT116, LS174T,
RKO cell lines, and recurrent tumor, primary tumor
or metastases of CRC cases #2, #14, #16). In contrast,
ATM mutations and E-cadherin expression appear to
stratify responders (ATM wildtype sequences and high
E-cadherin expression) from intermediate responders
and non-responders (ATM mutations and low E-cadherin
expression).

Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)
patients may include EGFR-targeted therapy if the
tumor does not harbor an activating downstream
RAS mutation. The monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody
(Cetuximab, Panitumumab) based therapies are hence
considered to be effective even without prior detection
of EGFR protein expression [34]. Still, even RAS
mutated CRCs may be responsive and vice-versa also
RAS wildtype CRCs may be resistant to EGFR-targeted
therapy. To elucidate potential mechanisms underlying
treatment responses to EGFR-targeted therapy, we
here comprehensively investigated 7 CRC cell lines
and tissue specimens of 25 CRC patients for putative
resistance mechanisms residing within the target (i.e.
EGFR), mutations of downstream signaling pathways or
in bypass receptor tyrosine kinases as well as E-cadherin
expression. Indeed, ATM and PIK3CA mutations as well
as E-cadherin expression may represent supplementary

showed intratumoral and intraglandular heterogeneity.

predictive markers for response to EGFR-targeted
therapy in CRC cell lines and patients.
As reported before [35–38], EGFR mRNA and
protein expression was low or undetectable in most of the
CRC cell lines and tissue specimens studied. If present,
EGFR protein expression was non-membranous. Only
one CRC case showed EGFR overexpression, most likely
explained by gene amplification [35], however this was
not related to EGFR-treatment response.
In CRC cell lines low EGFR expression correlated
to EGFR promoter methylation, but this was not the
case for CRC tissue specimens. A similar discrepancy
of EGFR promoter methylation and expression in CRC
tissue specimens was previously reported by Scartozzi et
al. [16] and Chiadini et al. [17]. In view of this, so far
EGFR methylation status [16, 17] or even genome-wide
methylation data [39] is controversially discussed as a
predictive marker for EGFR-targeted therapy.
Moreover, surprisingly EGFR protein expression
itself failed as predictive marker to EGFR-targeted
antibody-based therapy responses: For example, CRC
patients may respond to Cetuximab even without EGFR
expression [34] and - vice versa – CRC patients with
EGFR-positive tumors do not exhibit higher response rates
as compared to those CRC patients with EGFR-negative
tumors [40, 41]. Indeed, both our in vitro and in situ
analyses show that EGFR lacking tumor cells (e.g. DLD1)
may be responsive to EGFR inhibition. An explanation
for the positive response to EGFR-targeted inhibition
in EGFR-negative tumor cells in vitro or tumor tissue
specimens may be due to the dynamic nature of receptor
tyrosine kinases protein stability, shuttling between
cytosol and membrane as well as membranous anchoring
and cleavage. Hence, we confirm previous studies in that
EGFR (over)expression is not a feasible predictive marker
for EGFR-targeted therapy, quite in contrast to what is
seen for e.g. HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancers [42].
Furthermore, we did not detect the recently reported
EGFR “resistance” mutations in EGFR exon 12 (p.G465
or p.S492). However, these were reported to be absent in
KRAS wildtype tumors prior to EGFR-targeted therapy
[43, 44] and to emerge during EGFR-targeted treatment
[30, 33]. This underlines our finding of “baseline” EGFR
exon 12 wildtype sequences. Interestingly, 7 of 25
CRC cases carried a known EGFR SNP in intron 12/13
(rs1558544) but this did not correlate with EGFR-targeted
treatment response. The EGFR protein structure of this
EGFR variant remains unchanged according to AASsites
[45] and has been detected before in Gefitinib treated
lung adenocarcinoma patients without an association with
survival [46].
Thus, by next investigating the current predictive
marker RAS mutation status by targeted next generation
sequencing (tNGS), we identified RAS mutations in CRC
cell lines and tissue specimens of CRC patients treated by

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EGFR-targeted therapy. In fact, RAS mutations were seen
in both responding and non-responding CRC cell lines as
well as in CRC cases with long and short overall survival.
The responding cell line DLD1 and the intermediate
responding cell line HCT116 both carried a KRAS codon
p.G13 mutation, which was in fact reported previously as
being a “beneficial” mutation associated with Cetuximab
response by others before [47–49]. This RAS mutation
was not detected in the CRC cases. The CRC cases mostly
harbored a RAS exon 3 codon p.Q61 mutation, which at
the time of treatment of this retrospective CRC cohort
was not yet included into routine diagnostic and clinical
guidelines. Of the 8/25 patients with RAS mutations 5/8
showed progressive disease, for 2/8 no information about
response rate was available, further underlying the concept
of comprehensive RAS testing [7, 50]. However, RAS
testing alone cannot explain the poor response in other
CRC cases.
Hence, by tNGS we next screened for alterations
in genes coding for receptor tyrosine kinases, RAS/
MAPK and PIK3/AKT signaling pathways, which may
bypass EGFR inhibition by antibody-based therapies. We
detected alterations in RTK up to 59.6%, RAS/MAPK in
up to 38.3% and PIK3/AKT in up to 27.7%. No direct
correlation was found between these mutations and
response to EGFR-targeted therapy as evaluated by overall
survival. Indeed, combination of mutations in these downstream signaling pathways were shown to influence direct
(B)RAF inhibition [51, 52] rather than EGFR-targeted
therapy.
Of interest were the detected PIK3CA mutation
patterns. PIK3CA is frequently mutated in several solid
tumors [8] and mostly occur in PIK3CA exon 9 within the
coding region for the helical domain and exon 20 within
the coding region for the kinase domain [53], which was
also the case in our study (Supplementary Figure 4). The
PIK3CA exon 9 p.E545K as such leads to a change in
charge of the protein [53], whereas the PIK3CA p.H1047R
mutations results in constitutive activation [54]. Whilst
PIK3CA exon 9 mutation may be without gross functional
consequences, the activating exon 20 mutation may
result in resistance to up-stream EGFR-targeted therapy.
Indeed, the CRC cell line DLD1 responding to Cetuximab
exhibited two PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (p.E545K,
p.D549N), PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (p.H1047R) were
only observed in CRC cases with progressive disease
and short overall survival under EGFR-targeted therapy.
A direct predictive value of PIK3CA mutations for
Cetuximab resistance is still controversially discussed [55,
56], but PIK3CA mutations were reported by others to e.g.
also significantly correlate with lower progression free and
overall survival of CRC patients [7].
Besides direct EGFR signaling associated genes,
the most frequent mutations observed in CRC cell
lines and cases were ATM, SMAD4, KDR, ErBB4 and

FBXW7, as reported by others for CRC before [57, 58].
Indeed, SMAD4, ErBB4 and FBXW7 mutations appear
to confer treatment resistance to Cetuximab [5]. However,
this association was not seen in our study, with e.g.
SMAD4 (59), ErBB4 (39) and FBXW7 (38) mutations
being present in both EGFR-targeted therapy responders
and non-responders. In contrast, our study rather suggests
ATM mutations to be involved in treatment resistance to
Cetuximab. ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) belongs
to the PI3/PI4-kinase family, is able to form a complex
with EGFR [58], causes phosphorylation of AKT [59]
and was suggested as a therapeutic target in cancer [12].
The possible functional consequences of the here detected
ATM mutations in the EGFR pathway still need to be
elucidated, but are beyond the scope of this study.
Irrespective of the comprehensive analyses of
EGFR and mutations in associated signaling pathways,
other mechanisms may influence EGFR functionality and
its inhibition by therapeutic agents. As such, E-cadherin
plays a role in EGF receptor recruitment and activation
[59, 60]. Moreover, it was shown that cells loosing
E-cadherin are able to circumvent the classical EGFR
signaling and therefore acquire resistance to treatment with
antibodies against EGFR [24]. Finally, restoring E-cadherin
expression is postulated to increase the sensitivity to antiEGFR treatment [61]. Indeed, in our in vitro experiments
down-regulation of E-cadherin by siRNA in DLD1 cells
(high E-cadherin expressing cells, Cetuximab responders)
abrogated their response to Cetuximab. Moreover, two of
the non-responding CRC cell lines had only weak and/or
cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression, lacking the mature
E-cadherin protein. One hypothesis of how this E-cadherin
driven resistance mechanism may act, is that E-cadherin
is shed from the tumor cells in a soluble form, which – as
shown in in vitro model systems [22] – may then activate
EGFR promoting cell survival [62]. Our present data does
not directly confirm that E-cadherin cleavage and presence
of elevated levels of soluble E-cadherin are responsible for
Cetuximab resistance, but it clearly shows that dynamic
regulation of E-cadherin expression and intracellular
localization, respective E-cadherin maturity does have an
impact on CRC cells responses to Cetuximab. This was also
seen in situ, were we found 9/25 CRC cases which lacked
strong and complete membranous E-cadherin expression
in tumor cells. This is in part in accordance with a recent
study [23], which investigated 229 not therapy-preselected
CRC patients and only detected 4.3% of cases being
E-cadherin negative. Examining the precise dynamic nature
of E-cadherin expression and subcellular localization and/or
its cleavage and soluble form in formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded tissue specimens is currently technically not
possible. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrates that
a loss of E-cadherin expression is linked to EGFR-targeted
therapy non-responder CRC cell lines and cases.
In summary, our study comprehensively analyses
both CRC cell lines and tissue specimens for known
and novel putative predictive markers of EGFR-targeted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy responses and is the first to identify ATM
mutations and E-cadherin expression as potential novel
supportive predictive markers for EGFR-targeted therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
All cell lines (Caco-2, HT29, SW480, DLD1,
HCT116, LS174T, RKO) were cultured in a humidified
atmosphere (37°C, 5% CO2) in their corresponding medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies)
and 1% Glutamin (GE Healthcare). Caco-2, LS174T, RKO
and SW480 were cultured in DMEM, high glucose, DLD1
in RPMI, HCT116 and HT29 in McCoys 5A medium (all
Life Technologies). All CRC cell lines were screened for
mycoplasma contamination using Venor GeM Classic
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Minerva biolabs) and DNA
fingerprinting was performed for all seven cell lines at the
Leibniz Institute DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany.

Cell viability assay
The effect of Cetuximab (MerckSerono) on cell
proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines (Caco-2, HT29,
SW480, DLD1, HCT116, LS174T, RKO) was measured
using Cell titer 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay (MTS) (Promega). 2.0 – 3.5x103 cells/well were
seeded in triplicates on a 96 well plate and allowed to adhere
over night at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in
their corresponding medium. The cells were treated with
Cetuximab (0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100 μg/ml) and 0.9% NaCl
solution as control for 72h. Then, 20μl of MTS solution was
added and the absorbance was measured at 490nm with a
microplate reader (Tecan) after additional 2h incubation at
37°C. Proliferation was recorded as % of control.

Antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC)
The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay
was performed according to Fichter et al. [63]. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using
Pancoll lymphocyte separation medium (PAN-Biotech
GmbH). PBMCs were incubated with target cells (Caco2, HT29, SW480, DLD1, HCT116, LS174T, RKO) at
various effector-to-target ratios (1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, 1:10,
1:20, 1:40) in triplicates in medium alone or in medium
in the presence of 10μg/ml Cetuximab (MerckSerono).
After 4h, cytotoxicity was measured using the CytoTox
96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega).
The absorbance was recorded at 490nm using a 96-well
plate reader (Tecan). Percentage of cytotoxicity was
calculated using the following equation: %cytotoxicity =
(experimental - effector spontaneous - target spontaneous)
/ (target maximum - target spontaneous) x 100.

Down-regulation of E-cadherin by siRNA

metastases in 12/25 of cases were examined. 23/25 CRC
cases were previously tested for KRAS exon 2 mutations
at the Institute of Surgical Pathology, Medical Center –
University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. All patients
were treated with Cetuximab and/or Panitumumab, 22/25
received concurrent chemotherapy. All patients underwent
surgery at the Department of Surgery, Medical Center –
University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany between 2002
and 2014.
Tissue specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded (FFPE). Normal colonic epithelial cells were
derived from tissue blocks of the resection margin, whereas
primary tumors and metastases were derived from central
tumor mass.The use of tissue specimens was approved
by the local ethics institution (#251/04/07/09, #66/07
and #191/13 Ethik-Kommission, University of Freiburg,
Germany). The clinico-pathological characteristics of the
colorectal cancer patients are summarized in Table 2.

As adapted from the siRNA approach used by us
before [64] 1.7x105 DLD1 cells were transfected with
either 100nM E-cadherin siRNA (SMARTpool: si Genome
CDH1siRNA, GE Dharmacon) or Silencer negative
control siRNA, Thermo Fisher Scientific using Dharma
Fect2 Transfection Reagent, GE Dharmacon. Transfection
control was with DharmaFECT 2 Transfektion Reagent,
GE Dharmacon.
Cells were investigated at 72h post siRNA treatment
for E-cadherin protein levels by Western Blot and were
subjected to ADCC at 72h post siRNA treatment.

Immunofluorescence staining of
colorectal cancer cells
3x104cells/well were seeded onto a 24 well plate,
covered with sterile coverslides and allowed to adhere
overnight in their corresponding medium. Cells were
fixed in 2% formalin for 20 min at room temperature (RT),
permeabilized for 10 min at 4°C in 0.5% Triton-X100/
PBS, blocked for 1h at RT in 5% normal goat serum/0.3%
Triton-X100/PBS. E-cadherin antibody (1:200, clone
24E10, Cell signaling) and normal rabbit IgG isotype
control (Cell signaling) were incubated overnight at 4°C.
After removing the antibodies and washing with 1x PBS
the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG A488 (1:200)
was added and incubated for 1h in the dark. The cells were
washed again and were counterstained with vectashield
mounting medium with DAPI (vector laboratories).
Pictures were taken using a fluorescence microscope
(Axioplan 2 imaging with apotome system, Carl Zeiss).

Immunohistochemistry staining
Serial sections (2μM) of formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissues were used for EGFR and
E-cadherin staining. The tissue sections were incubated
at 37°C (EGFR) or 58°C (E-cadherin) overnight,
deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol
in decreasing concentrations (96%, 70%). After antigen
retrieval (EGFR: digestion with 0.05% proteinase K for
5min; E-cadherin NCH-38: pH6.1 buffer by pressure
cooker/sico for 2min; E-cadherin 24E10: pH6.1 buffer,
pressure cooker for 5 min), tissue sections were stained
with diluted antibodies to EGFR (mouse monoclonal,
clone H11, 1:500, 1 hr, DakoCytomation/Agilent) and to
two different antibodies E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal,
clone NCH-38, 1:1000, 30min, DakoCytomation/Agilent;
rabbit monoclonal, clone 24E10, 1:100, 30min, Cell
Signaling Technology,) followed by the Dako REAL
Detection System (alkaline phosphatase/RED, rabbit/
mouse, Dako) for EGFR and the EnVisionTM Flex System
for E-cadherin.
All steps were performed on an autostainer
(Dako). Scoring for EGFR was according to Fichter
et al. [63]. Score 0=negative expression/incomplete
membranous in ≤10% tumor cells, score 1=partial
membranous expression in >10%tumor cells, score
2=weak, but complete membranous expression in
>10% tumor cells and score 3=strong and complete
membranous expression in >10% tumor cells. Scoring
for E-cadherin was performed according to Kang et al.
[23], with an immunoreactive score (IRS) that combines
% immunopositive cells (0=0%, 1=<10%, 2=10-50%,
3=51-80%, 4>80%) with staining intensity (0=no
staining, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong) resulting
in overall IRS scores from 0-12. IHC stainings were
evaluated by two independend observers (ALG, LL).

Cell lysis and western blotting
Total protein lysates were prepared using Qproteome
Mammalian Protein Prep Kit (Qiagen). The following
antibodies were used for immunodetection: E-cadherin
(1:2000, clone 24E10, Cell signaling), β-Actin (1:5000,
Sigma Aldrich). Bands were quantified by using fusion
capt Advance FX7 software (Vilber).

Detection of soluble E-cadherin by ELISA
Soluble E-cadherin was measured in cell culture
supernatants using Quantikine ELISA (human E-cadherin
immunoassay, R&D Systems) according to the
manufacturer′s instructions. Cell culture supernatants of
seven colorectal cancer cell lines were harvested after 48h
and 72h. Three independent experiments were performed
and data given as mean +/- standard deviation.

Patients and tissue specimens
This study included 25 colorectal cancer patients, of
whom primary or recurrent tumors as well as liver or lung

(Qiagen). Three to five CpG sites were evaluated
per gene. A gene was classified as methylated, if the
difference in mean methylation between tumor and the
corresponding normal tissue was ≥ 19%. A case was
defined as CIMP positive, if ≥ 3/5 of analyzed CIMPrelated genes were methylated and CIMP negative
otherwise. EGFR methylation analysis of three CpG
sites was performed as above using the Hs_EGFR_02_
PM (PM00030569) PyroMark CpG assay (Qiagen).

Tumor cells were marked for all tissue specimens on
newly prepared hematoxylin-eosin sections by a qualified
pathologist (LL) for subsequent microdissection of tumor
cells under morphological control. Tissue slides were
deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol
in decreasing concentrations (100%, 90%, 70%, 50%),
briefly stained in hematoxylin and digested overnight.
DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue
Kit and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy FFPE Kit.
DNA and RNA of patient #25 were available from a
previous isolation using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE
Kit. Total DNA of cell lines was isolated using DNeasy
Blood &Tissue Kit and total RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Mini Kit. All isolation kits were from Qiagen and
isolations were according to manufacturer′s instructions.

Next generation sequencing
As reported by us before [69], DNA quality
was measured using FFPE QC kit and libraries were
prepared using the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel
(48 cancer related genes) (both Illumina). Quantity
and quality of libraries were examined using the
Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies)
and DNAs were pooled for sequencing on the MiSeq
(Illumina). Mutations, passing the filter, were listed
using VariantStudio (Illumina). Missense, stop gained
and frameshift mutations displaying read depth >100,
alt variant frequency >10 and occurring inside the gene
were incorporated in the study.

Microsatellite instability testing (MSI)
For MSI testing, a new multiplex PCR protocol was
established with modifications to a previous protocol [65].
In brief, 25-μl PCR multiplex fluorescent reaction mix
was composed of 1 x PCR buffer (Qiagen), 2mM MgCl2
(Qiagen), 0.4 mM dNTPs (ThermoFisher Scientific), TaqPolymerase 1.25 units (Qiagen) and primer sets FAM
or VIC-labeled in the following concentrations: 0.1μM
(Bat25-F-NED, Bat26-F-VIC, D2S123-F-VIC, D5S346FFAM), 0.2μM (Bat25-R, Bat26-R, D2S123-R, D5S346-R,
D17S250-F-FAM), 0.4μM (D17S250-R). 100ng normal
and tumor DNA were used for PCR, which was performed
in a Biometra Professional TRIO Thermocycler according
to cycling conditions of Berg et al [65]. Fluorescently
labeled PCR products were detected using ABI PRISM
3130xl Genetic Analyzer and GeneMapper 4.0 software
for data analysis.

EGFR mutation analysis by dideoxy sequencing
EGFR Exon 12 mutations at codon G465 and
S492 were analyzed using the following primers.
G465: For-5′-TTTCTCTTGCAGTCGTCAGC-3′, rev5′-TGCAGCTGTTTTCACCTCTG-3′. S492R: For-5′GTGCTATGCAAATACAATAAACTGG-3′ and rev5′GGACCCATTAGAACCAACTCC-3′ [43] 100 ng of
DNA were amplified using 20μM/primer in a first PCR.
The PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR
purification kit according to manufacturer′s instructions
(Qiagen) and a second cycle-PCR for sequencing was
performed. For dye terminator removal, DNA products
were cleaned up via DyeEx 2.0 Spin Kit (Qiagen)
and sequenced on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, United States).

CpG island methylator phenotype classification
and analysis of EGFR promoter methylation
For determination of CpG island methylator
phenotype (CIMP) and EGFR promoter methylation,
DNA was bisulfite converted using the EpiTect Fast
Bisulfite Conversion Kit, according to manufacturer′s
instructions (Qiagen). For each gene specific PCR
reaction, 20 ng of bisulfite converted DNA was used.
CIMP type definition was performed according to
modified protocols by Weisenberger et al. [66], Zlobec
et al. [67] and Ogino et al. [68]. Methylation of five
CIMP-related genes RUNX3, CACNA1G, EPM2AIP1/
MLH1, NEUROG1 and CRABP1 was measured
using the following PyroMark CpG assays: Hs_
RUNX3_08_PM (PM00000161), Hs_CACNA1G_02_
PM (PM00064736), Hs_EPM2AIP1/MLH1_01_PM
(PM00104832), Hs_NEUROG1_01_PM (PM00023632)
Hs_CRABP1_02_PM (PM00059605) (Qiagen). Data
was analyzed using the PyroMark Q24 Software
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EGFR mRNA expression
EGFR mRNA expression was measured by q-RT-PCR.
First, 750 ng RNA was transcribed in cDNA using M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, United States).
Next, cDNA was amplified with primers and probes for
EGFR (For-5′- GCCTCCAGAGGATGTTCAATAA-3′, rev5′-TGAGGGCAATGAGGACATAAC-3′, probe 5′-TGAG
GTGGTCCTTGGGAATTTGGA-3′) and the reference
gene TBP (for-5′-GCCCGAAACGCCGAATAT-3′, rev-5′-C
CGTGGTTCGTGGCTCTCT-3′, probe 5′-ATCCCAAGC
GGTTTGCTGCGG-3′) [70]. The analysis was performed on
a 7900HT fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
Relative expression of the genes of interest was calculated
using the 2-∆∆CT-method. [71, 72]. Besides unknown samples,
17186
