ABSTRACT
The β-galactoside α2-6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-I) is the principal
sialyltransferase responsible for the addition of α2-6-sialic acid to the termini N-glycans
on cell surface. Although ST6Gal-I in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutics
agents has been previously reported, the role of ST6Gal-I in clinical drug resistance of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not fully understood. In this study, we found that
knockdown of ST6Gal-I increased the sensitivity of hepatocarcinoma MHCC97-H cells
to docetaxel treatment by instigating the process of apoptosis. Silencing ST6Gal-I
expression decreased the survival rate of MHCC97-H cells after docetaxel treatment.
Importantly, ST6Gal-I silencing resulted in an increasing of phospho-p38, Bax, Bad,
cytochrome c and the cleaved caspase-9, 3 and PARP, while a decreasing of the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In addition, we found that p38 MAPK and caspase-3
inhibitors can reduce the enhanced apoptosis levels of MHCC97-H cells resulted by
either ST6Gal-I silencing or docetaxel treatment. Conversely, exogenous expression of
ST6Gal-I in hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells inhibited apoptotic cell death and prevented
docetaxel-induced apoptosis by inhibiting p38 MAPK mediated mitochondrialdependent pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that ST6Gal-I might play
a positive role in mediating the survival of human hepatocarcinoma cells and could
be a potential target for gene and antitumor drugs therapy.

The β-galactoside α2-6-sialyltransferase 1 ST6Gal-I
can catalyze the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-sialic
acid to the termini Galβ1-4GlcNAc units of N-glycans
[5]. ST6Gal-I is known to be highly expressed in multiple
types of cancer, including colorectal, ovarian, oral, breast,
epithelial and liver carcinomas [6–11], and its expression
has been positively correlated with adhesion, invasion and
metastasis in tumor cells [12–14]. Recently it has been
reported that ST6Gal-I mediates the sialylation of tumornecrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) and Fas receptors to
inhibit cell apoptosis, and plays a vital role in resistance to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer [15, 16, 7].
However, the relationship between ST6Gal-I and clinical
drug resistance of HCC still remains poorly understood.

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer (mainly hepatocellular carcinoma,
HCC) is the second most frequent cause of death from
cancer (745,000 deaths in 2012) in the world [1]. It is a
leading cancer in developing countries where 649,000 new
cases were estimated in 2012, especially in China (50% of
the total) [2]. Despite recent advances in chemotherapy
and surgical resection during the treatment of HCC, its
prognosis still remains poor due to tumors recurrence
and metastasis [3]. The frequency of chemotherapeutic
drugs resistance has inspired researchers to focus on new
molecular mechanisms which can be potentially involved
in the pathogenesis and treatment of HCC [4].

Docetaxel (DTX) is a semisynthetic analogue of
taxane, extracted from needles of European yew. It was
reported to be involved in the mechanisms inhibiting
microtubules disassembly as well as the enhancement of
tubulin polymerization [17, 18]. Docetaxel had shown
effective actions either alone or in combination with other
chemotherapeutic drugs during the treatment of various
types of cancer including prostate, ovarian, breast, nonsmall cell lung and liver cancers [19–23]. Taking the
fact that ST6Gal-I is significantly overexpressed in liver
cancer, and its important role in tumor cell apoptosis, we
aimed to determine whether its expression could impact
the sensitivity of hepatocarcinoma cells to docetaxel.
Nevertheless, due to the lack of specificity into tissues and
cells, the challenge lies into the pretreatment of docetaxelresistant advanced HCC [24].
In this study, we analyzed the role of ST6Gal-I
in the apoptosis and sensitivity of hepatocarcinoma
cells to docetaxel, and explored the possible molecular
mechanisms involved in the regulation of tumor cells
apoptosis and chemosensitivity. The results showed
that ST6Gal-I knockdown increased the sensitivity of
hepatocarcinoma MHCC97-H cells to docetaxel, and
ST6Gal-I overexpression inhibited the docetaxel-induced
apoptosis in Huh7 cells. In addtion, ST6Gal-I silencing
resulted in the activation of p38 MAPK signaling
pathway, while a decreasing of the anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-2. Conversely, ST6Gal-I overexpression in Huh7
cells inhibited p38 MAPK mediated mitochondrialdependent pathway. Together, this study indicates that
ST6Gal-I could modulates docetaxel sensitivity in
human hepatocarcinoma cells via the p38 MAPK/caspase
pathway, and might be a potential target for gene and
antitumor drugs therapy.

as compared to the control cells in the presence or absence
of docetaxel (Figure 1B). Furthermore, we observed more
marked morphological changes in ST6Gal-I knockdown
cells (Figure 1C). These results indicate that silencing
ST6Gal-I can increase the sensitivity of MHCC97-H cells
to docetaxel treatment.
To determine whether the enhanced apoptosis in
ST6Gal-I knockdown cells combined with docetaxel
treatment is reflected at the level of cell survival, we
performed a colorimetric cell viability (CCK8) assay.
We found that the ST6Gal-I knockdown cells were less
resistant to docetaxel than control cells when exposed
to different concentrations for 24h and 48h (Figure 1D).
These results suggest that ST6Gal-I knockdown leads
to reduced cell survival of MHCC97-H cells following
docetaxel treatment.

ST6Gal-I silencing sensitizes MHCC97-H
cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis through
potentiation of p38 MAPK mediated
mitochondrial-dependent pathway
To investigate the molecular events involved in
docetaxel-induced apoptosis, we checked the role of
ST6Gal-I knockdown in the activation of the caspase
cascade. The expression of cytochrome c and the cleaved
caspase-9, 3 and PARP were investigated by Western-blot
analysis. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, their expression
levels significantly increase in ST6Gal-I knockdown cells
either alone or in combination with docetaxel treatment.
Meanwhile, no apparent changes in the expression of
ST6Gal-I were observed after docetaxel treatment.
The role of caspases in the apoptotic cascade have
been linked to the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway
[25], we therefore examined the role of ST6Gal-I silencing
in this pathway. As shown in Figure 2C and 2D, there was
no significant difference in the p38 expression between
different groups. However, phosphorylated p38 (pp38)
expression was significantly increased in ST6Gal-I
knockdown cells, for both untreated and treated with
docetaxel. We also checked the expression of Bcl-2 family
proteins, and found that ST6Gal-I silencing induces a
decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 while the expression
of Bax and Bad increased significantly.
Together, these findings suggest that ST6Gal-I
silencing could enhanced docetaxel-induced apoptosis,
which might be attributed to the potentiation of p38
MAPK mediated mitochondrial-dependent pathway.

RESULTS
Silencing ST6Gal-I expression induces apoptosis
and enhances sensitivity of MHCC97-H cells to
docetaxel
To explore the potential role of ST6Gal-I in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells, we used shRNA to
silence the expression of ST6Gal-I in MHCC97-H cells
which have higher expression level of ST6Gal-I. The
knockdown efficiency was analyzed by RT-PCR, Westernblot and Lectin-blot assays. The results demonstrated that
ST6Gal-I-shRNA transfection in MHCC97-H significantly
decreased the expression of ST6Gal-I in mRNA, protein
and glycans levels (*P<0.05) (Figure 1Ai, Aii and Aiii).
Two stable knockdown cell lines and control
cells were treated with docetaxel to study the possible
functions of ST6Gal-I in modulating the apoptosis and
chemosensitivity in hepacellular carcinoma cells. Using
Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, we found that the apoptosis
rates of ST6Gal-I knockdown cells increased statistically

caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-CHO) before exposure to 0μM
or 50μM docetaxel. We found that in the presence or
absence of docetaxel, after treatment with SB203580, the
protein levels of pp38, proapoptotic members Bax and
Bad, cytochrome c, the cleaved caspase-9, 3 and PARP
were inhibited, while the expression of Bcl-2 increased

significantly. However, addition of Ac-DEVD-CHO only
decreased the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and
PARP, and there are no apparent changes observed in the
expression of ST6Gal-I and p38 (Figure 3). Therefore,
these findings provide more convincing information
about the downstream pathway underlining the ST6Gal-I
regulatory network.

ST6Gal-I overexpressed cells compared to control cells
either alone or in combination with docetaxel treatment
(Figures 5A and 5B). Meanwhile, there was no significant
difference in the ST6Gal-I expression after docetacel
treatment. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, pp38, Bax and

expression of ST6Gal-I could protect hepatocarcinoma
Huh7 cells from docetaxel-induced apoptosis. These
observations clearly indicate that the changes in ST6Gal-I
expression levels may consequently affect the biological
functions of tumor cells such as apoptosis and survival.
Many cellular stress signaling pathways have been
involved in the apoptosis machinery and most of them
are executed in an orderly manner. Among the different

molecular regulations, the caspase cascade represents
a key system. Our results have emphasized a regulatory
network where ST6Gal-I facilitates the docetaxel-induced
apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway with the
release of cytochrome c which in turn activates caspase-9
[28]. Consequently, caspase-9 affects the activation of
downstream caspase-3 which cleaves the target proteins
like PARP leading to DNA damage and cell death [29].

Bcl-2 family members are known to play an integral
role in the regulation of caspases activation and in
the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [30]. This might
explain the reason why the increasing levels of the proapoptotic proteins (Bad and Bax) and the decreasing level
of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) were observed in the
ST6Gal-I knockdown cells. Therefore, ST6Gal-I may be
a potential and valuable target for the clinical treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Docetaxel plays a vital role in the regulation of
Bcl-2 phosphorylation, which might through the action of
kinases in tumor cells [31]. Among the various kinases
pathway, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38
MAPK) plays a key role in signal transduction and other
cellular processes. Previous studies have reported that
p38 MAPK pathway participate in docetaxel-induced
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, and it may play both the
role of activator and effector for the caspase cascade [32,
33]. Here, we observed that knockdown/overexpression
of ST6Gal-I increase/decrease the p38 phosphorylation,
highlighting its instigating role in the modulation of the

apoptotic network through the p38 MAPK pathway.
In addition, theses finding were confirmed by using
SB203580 and Ac-DEVD-CHO inhibitors of the p38
MAPK pathway and caspase-3 respectively which induce
a decrease in the expression of the proteins localized in the
downstream of the different pathways.
Although not fully understood, the roles of α2,6
sialylation in cancer progression may be exerted by affecting
the structures of specific sialylated glycoproteins [34]. It has
been reported that β1 intergrin, CD45, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), TNFR1 and Fas death receptors are
the target proteins for ST6Gal-I [35-37, 15, 16]. ST6Gal-I
expression is well known to be modulated at the transcript
level and positively regulated by oncogenic ras [38, 39].
In spite of the fact that many proteins involved in the
regulation of ST6Gal-I transcription, the specific substrates
of ST6Gal-I and the information regarding how ST6Gal-I
is regulated by ras during docetaxel induced-apoptosis in
hepatocarcinoma cells still deserve further study.
In summary, ST6Gal-I is involved in the apoptosis
and survival of hepatocarcinoma cells by the modulation

of the primer pairs were as follows: for ST6Gal-I,
5′-AGCCCTTTTACATCCTCAAG-3′ (forward) and
5′-ATGATGATACCAAGCATCCC-3′ (reverse); for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
5′-CACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTC-3′ (forward)
and
5′-GACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAG-3′
(reverse). PCR reactions were incubated at 94°C for 3
min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 57°C for 40
s, 70°C for 50 s, and then a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. The amplified products were separated by agarose gel
electrophoresis on 2% gel and analyzed by BioImaging
systems (UVP, Labworks, ver. 4.6).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human hepatoma carcinoma cell line MHCC97-H
was purchased from Liver Cancer Institute (Zhongshan
Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China). Established
HCC cell line Huh7 was purchased from the Cell Bank
of CAS (Shanghai, China). Cells were maintained in
Dulborcco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)(Gibco)
and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Gibco). All cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Lectin blot analysis
Cell lysates containing 30ug of proteins were
subjected to 10 % sodiumdodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). One gel was subjected
to Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining and another
was transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membrane (Pall
Corporation). Then incubated with Biotin-labeled lectin
Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA, Vector, 1:2000) and
streptavidin-HRP (ZSGB-BIO, 1:4000) for 1h separately
at room temperature. The detection was performed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Advansta).
Densitometry of proteins was analyzed with Gel-Pro
software.

Construction of vectors and establishment of
stable transfectants
The CDS region of ST6Gal-I (1218 bp) was cloned
into the pcDNA3.1 (-) vector to construct pcDNA3.1/
ST6Gal-I. The sequences of the primer pairs were as
follows: Forward, 5′-GGGCCCATGATTCACACC
AACCTGAAG-3′ (Apa I); Reverse, 5′-CTCGAGG
CAGTGAATGGTCCGGAAGCC-3′ (Xho I). Short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) specific for ST6Gal-I (ST6Gal-I-shRNA)
and Negative Control-shRNA (NC-shRNA) were obtained
from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The sequences of
the short hairpin RNA were as follows, ST6Gal-I-shRNA:
5′-CACCGTACCAGAATCCGGATTATTTCAAGAGAA
TAATCCG GATTCTGGTACTTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-GATC
CAAAAAAGTACCAGAATCCGGATTATTCTCTTGA

CGTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTCAAGAGATTACGT
GACACGTTCGGAGAATTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-GAT
CCAAAAAATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTAATCTCTT
GACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAAC. Those shRNAs
were annealed and ligated into pGPU6 vector to generate
shRNA constructs (ST6Gal-I-shRNA, NC-shRNA). Cells
were transfected with the mixture of ST6Gal-I-shRNA
or NC-shRNA or pcDNA3.1/ST6Gal-I or pcDNA3.1
and Lipofectamine2000TM (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instraction. After 48h, the culture
medium was replaced with complete medium containing
800 mg/ml of G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) for selecting stably
transtected cells. Stable clones were isolated and expanded
for further studies.

Flow cytometry analysis for apoptosis
The apoptosis rate within each group of
hepatocarcinoma cells were determined by using flow
cytometry analysis with an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis
detection kit (Dojindo Laboratories). The cells were
prepared with certain concentration of docetaxel (SigmaAldrich) for 24 h, harvested, washed twice with cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 × 105 cells were
resuspended in 100 ul 1× Annexin-V Binding Solution,
and then incubated with Annexin V-FITC and PI solutions
at room temperature for 15 min in the darkness before the
addition of 400 ul 1× Annexin-V Binding Solution. The
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).

DAPI staining
Formation of condensed chromatin and apoptosis
bodies in hepatocarcinoma cells were quantified with
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining.
The cells were treated with certain concentration
of docetaxel for 24 h and fixed with chilled 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min.
The treated cells were then washed with cold PBS and
stained with DAPI solution for 3 min in the dark. After
washing with cold PBS, stained nuclei were imaged
by fluorenscence microscope (Olympus Corp). The
apoptotic ratio % = (apoptotic cells) / (total cells)× 100.

RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAiso
Reagent Plus (Takara), and complementary DNA (cDNA)
was synthesized using RT-PCR kit (Takara) according

Statistical analysis
The quantitative data were presented as mean ± SD
and experimental differences were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA and two-tailed Student’s t-test using SPSS 13.0
software. A value of P < 0.05 was considered as statistical
significant. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
