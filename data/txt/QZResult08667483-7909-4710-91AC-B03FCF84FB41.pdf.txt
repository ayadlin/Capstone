Abstract
The genetic changes and mechanisms underlying the progression of estrogen-dependent breast cancers to estrogenindependent, antiestrogen-resistant, and metastatic breast
cancers are unclear despite being a major problem in
endocrine therapy. To identify genes responsible for this
progression, we carried out a genetic screening by an enhanced
retroviral mutagen (ERM)–mediated random mutagenesis in
the estrogen-dependent T47D breast cancer cells. We found
that T47D cells contain only one p27kip1 (p27) allele coding
for the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. An ERM
insertion into the p27 locus of T47D cells disrupted the p27
gene and created estrogen-independent and antiestrogenresistant breast cancer cells that still maintained functional
estrogen receptors. Disruption of p27 in T47D cells resulted
in several changes, and most of these changes could be rescued
by p27 restoration. First, CDK2 activity was increased in the
absence of estrogen or in the presence of estrogen antagonists
tamoxifen or ICI 182780; second, amplified in breast cancer 1
(AIB1), a cancer overexpressed transcriptional coactivator,
was hyperphosphorylated, which made AIB1 a better coactivator for E2F1; and third, growth factor receptor binding
protein 2–associated binder 2 (Gab2) and Akt activity were
increased following E2F1 overactivation, leading to a significant enhancement of cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the p27-deficient cells, but not T47D control cells,
developed lung metastasis in an ovarian hormone–independent manner when they were i.v. injected into nude mice.
In sum, loss of p27 activated AIB1, E2F1, Gab2, and Akt; increased cell migration and invasion; caused antiestrogen
insensitivity; and promoted metastasis of breast cancer cells.
These findings suggest that p27 plays an essential role in
restriction of breast cancer progression. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
In estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, estrogen, through
estrogen receptor a (ERa), enhances c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression,
down-regulates p27, and activates cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK)-2 to promote G1-S transition (1, 2). Because most primary
breast cancers express ERa and require estrogen to grow, estrogen
antagonists and aromatase inhibitors such as tamoxifen and letrozole
are used to treat estrogen-dependent breast cancers (3–5). Although
these treatments are initially effective, acquired resistances are a

major problem. In most cases, development of drug resistance is not
due to a loss or mutation of ERa (4, 6).
Overexpression or activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
and Ras oncoproteins is common in cancers. Human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu overexpression happens in
20% to 30% breast cancers and correlates with more aggressive
cancer phenotypes and tamoxifen resistance (7, 8). Ras and RTKs
including HER2, insulin-like growth factor I receptor, and
epidermal growth factor receptor activate the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (9–12). This pathway plays a pivotal
role in cell survival, proliferation, motility, tumorigenesis, and
metastasis through phosphorylation and subsequent relocalization
of key regulatory molecules such as p27 (13–15).
In cell nucleus, p27 associates with cyclin E-CDK2 and inhibits Rb
hyperphosphorylation to keep cells in G1 phase (16). Mitogenic stimuli
cause p27 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, degradation, and translocation to the cytoplasm and increase cyclin E-CDK2 activity, leading
to G1-S transition through Rb phosphorylation and E2F activation
(16). In breast cancers overexpressing HER2, Akt phosphorylates p27
and keeps p27 in the cytoplasm, which precludes p27-induced G1
arrest (13–15). Therefore, both total p27 reduction and p27 exclusion
from the nucleus of breast cancer cells are associated with poor
prognosis and estrogen independence (16, 17). Down-regulation of
p27 also enhances MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth in the presence of
antiestrogens (18, 19). However, despite many studies correlating p27
levels and locations with tumorigenesis, the lack of p27 null mutation
in human tumors has made it difficult to understand the exact role of
p27 in breast cancer progression (20). Furthermore, the fact that
oncogene-induced mammary tumorigenesis is accelerated in p27+/
mice but suppressed in p27 / mice suggests a complex role of p27
in breast cancer (21).
E2F is the key transcriptional factor for cell cycle progression
(16). E2F1 interacts with amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), and
this interaction potentiates E2F1 target gene expression (22, 23).
AIB1 is a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and
other transcription factors including E2F1 (22, 24). AIB1 is
overexpressed in f60% of human breast tumors (25). Overexpression
of AIB1 in mouse mammary epithelium causes mammary carcinomas (26), whereas inactivation of AIB1 in mice suppresses oncogene
and carcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis (27, 28). These
findings indicate that AIB1 is an oncogene. AIB1 activity is not only
determined by its concentration but also regulated by phosphorylation (29). In addition, E2F1, through up-regulation of the adaptor
protein growth factor receptor binding protein 2–associated binder 2
(Gab2), strongly activates Akt (30), which promotes cell motility,
invasion, and cancer metastasis (31, 32). Thus, we hypothesize that
the serial events initiated by p27 inactivation may promote breast
cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.
In this study, we have done a genetic screening by using the
enhanced retroviral mutagen (ERM) system (33) and identified the

A Role of p27 in Breast Cancer Progression

Figure 1. Disruption of p27 in T47D cells causes loss of G1-S checkpoint and estrogen-independent growth. A, T47DtTA (tTA ) and T47DtTA/p27m (p27m ) cells
were cultured in medium containing BrdUrd and 10% FCS or 10% CSFCS. BrdUrd incorporation and DNA content per cell were analyzed by fluorescence labeling
and flow cytometry. Cell fractions (%) are indicated. Note the increase in G2-M fraction of T47DtTA/p27m cells cultured in medium with FCS and the unchanged
proliferation status of T47DtTA/p27m cells cultured in medium with CSFCS. B, the p27 gene structure and the insertional disruption of p27 by ERM. The first and second
exons of p27 and p27 protein are outlined. The ERM insertion site and the locations of four primers (P1–P4 ) used for PCR are indicated. White box, noncoding
regions; gray box, amino acid coding regions; SD, splice donor; stretched box, the ERM tag. CBD, cyclin binding domain; CDKBD, cyclin dependent kinase binding

presence of 523-bp P4/P3 product of the ERM allele in T47DtTA/p27m cells. The 474-bp P1/P2 products were amplified from exon 1 and served as a positive control
for the PCR. The ERM insertion was longer than 3 kb and thereby PCR using P1/P3 and Taq DNA polymerase was unable to amplify this long fragment in T47DtTA/p27m
cells. D, immunoblotting analyses with antibodies against p27 COOH terminus (a-C ; BD Transduction Lab) and p27 NH2 terminus (a-N ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

p27 loss-of-function clone. We show that p27 deficiency in T47D
cells causes estrogen-independent and antiestrogen-resistant
growth; stimulates AIB1 phosphorylation and its coactivator
activity for E2F1; promotes Akt activity, cell motility, and invasion;
and results in lung metastasis in ovariectomized nude mice
injected i.v. with these cells.

Materials and Methods
Retroviral infection. T47D cells (104) were infected with MSCV-Eco-zeo
and MSCV-SV-tTA viruses (multiplicity of infection, 10:1) and selected in
medium with 200 Ag/mL G418 (33). The surviving T47DtTA cells were
expanded to 107, transferred into six-well plates (5  105 per well), and
spin-infected with ERM retroviruses. Each of the three ERM retroviral
vectors carried an ERM promoter, an expression tag in one of the three
reading frames, and a splice donor (Fig. 1B; ref. 33). Two days after ERM
infection, cells were transferred to 100-mm dishes for a 30-day selection in
RPMI 1640 containing 10 Ag/mL insulin, 10% charcoal dextran–stripped
FCS (CSFCS), and 1 Ag/mL puromycin. For p27 expression, the COOHterminally poly-histidine–tagged p27 cDNA was taken from the pCMV-p27
plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Mong-Hong Lee, Department of Molecular
and Cellular Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX) and subcloned into the pQCXIH retroviral plasmid (BD

Biosciences). The pQCXIH-p27 retroviruses were produced in PT67 packaging cells.
Reverse transcription-PCR for identification of ERM-targeted genes.
Colonies were isolated and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 Ag/mL insulin
and 10% CSFCS. RNA was prepared and reverse transcribed with primer 5¶GCAAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATCCNNNN(G/C)ACG. PCR was done
using ERM-tag primer (5¶-ACCATGGGGAGCAGCAAGAGCAAACCAAAAGACCCCAGCCAACGC) and T7 primer. PCR products were sequenced and
GenBank was searched to identify ERM-targeted genes.
Cell cycle analysis, colony formation assay, immunochemical analyses,
kinase assay, transfection assay, and migration and invasion assays. These
assays were carried out by following standard methods as previously
described (28, 29, 34). For details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Tumor growth and experimental metastasis assays. Mouse protocols
were approved by Baylor College of Medicine Animal Care and Use and
Committee. For tumor growth in mammary glands, 8  106 cells were
mixed with Matrigel and injected into both fourth mammary fat pads of
ovariectomized athymic nude mice (35). Each type of cells was injected into
six mice without pellets and six mice with 60-day estradiol-releasing pellets
(1.7 mg/pellet from Innovative Research). Four weeks after injection,
tumors were excised for histology and immunohistochemistry. Other organs
including lung, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes were examined for
metastasis. For experimental metastasis, 106 cells were injected into the tail
lateral vein of ovariectomized nude mice. Three weeks after injection, their

lungs were examined for metastasis and processed for histology and

Results
Identification of estrogen-independent growth mutants.
T47D cells express ERa and depend on estrogen to grow and
survive. A genome-wide screening using ERM was used to identify
genes with gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations that
could make T47D cells survive in estrogen-free medium. To prepare
cells for ERM infection, T47D cells were first infected with MSCVEco-zeo viruses to express the mouse ecotropic receptor and with
MSCV-SV-tTA to express tTA tetracycline-off regulator. The
obtained stable T47DtTA cells were subsequently infected with
ERM and growth selected in estrogen-free medium. As expected,
no colonies were found from uninfected T47DtTA cells after culturing in the estrogen-free medium. In contrast, f150 colonies
formed from a total of 5 million ERM-infected T47DtTA cells in the
selection medium. Surviving colonies were isolated and the ERM-

targeted genes were identified in each clone with the use of reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) that amplified ERM expression tag
and its trapped 3¶ exon sequences (33). Of 15 clones analyzed, we
obtained 12 RNA sequences containing ERM tag. Each of the 12
clones only produced one ERM tag-fused RNA sequence, indicating
that each clone contains a single ERM integration. Among these
estrogen-independent growth mutants (EIGM), EIGM-1 was a lossof-function mutation for p27, which was characterized in this
study. The other 11 clones included 1 small GTPase (EIGM-2–
EIGM-4), 2 components of the Wnt signaling pathway (EIGM-5 and
EIGM-6), 1 transcription factor (EIGM-7), 1 Golgi protein (EIGM-8),
1 bone marrow stromal cell antigen (EIGM-9), 1 enolase (EIGM-10),
and 2 hypothetical proteins (EIGM-11 and EIGM-12).
Disruption of the single p27kip1 allele in T47D cells results
in estrogen-independent growth. The sequence of EIGM-1
matched the second exon of the p27 gene; thus, it was designated as
T47DtTA/p27m. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling assay confirmed
the estrogen-independent growth feature of T47DtTA/p27m cells. About

For growth assay (bottom ), T47DtTA, T47DtTA/p27m, and T47DtTA/p27m/+p27 cells (105 per well; n = 4) were cultured in medium containing 10% CSFCS overnight and
then changed to either medium containing 10% FCS and vehicle, 4-OH-tamoxifen, or ICI 182780 or medium with 10% CSFCS. Cells were cultured for 4 d before
harvesting and counted. Columns, mean fold increase in cell number; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA. C, photographs of crystal violet–stained

(E2 ), and ICI 182780 in estrogen-free medium. Note that the PRs were increased by estradiol treatment and reduced by ICI 182780 treatment in both types of
cells. Protein loading amounts were reflected by immunoblotting analysis of h-actin.

hypophosphorylated p130 (p130 ), and h-actin control.
For CDK2 kinase activity assay, the cyclin E-CDK2
complexes were immunoprecipitated with a cyclin E
antibody from equal amounts of cell lysates. CDK2
kinase activity was assayed by using [g-32P]ATP and
histone H1 as substrates. Relative band intensity
(Rel. Int. ) of the phosphorylated histone H1 in each
lane is indicated by setting the first lane as 1. For
immunoblotting analyses of the phosphorylated Rb
and p130, the ratios of hyperphosphorylated Rb and
pp130 to hypophosphorylated Rb and p130 are
indicated for each lane, respectively. Note that the
increases in hypophosphorylated Rb and p130
were observed only in T47DtTA cells but not in
T47DtTA/p27m cells after these cells were treated with
4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI 182780, and CSFCS.

93% T47DtTA parent cells cultured in the estrogen-free medium
were arrested at G1 and <0.3% cells were labeled with BrdUrd. In
contrast, only 66% T47DtTA/p27m cells cultured in the estrogen-free
medium were in G1 and as many as 8.6% T47DtTA/p27m cells were
labeled with BrdUrd, which were similar to T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m
cells cultured in the growth medium with complete serum (Fig. 1A).
The p27 gene contains two exons separated by a 511-bp intron.
Exons 1 and 2 encode for the NH2-terminal 158 and the COOHterminal 40 (159–198) amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 1B).
PCR and sequence analyses revealed that the ERM integration site
was between bp 174 and 175 of intron 1 (Fig. 1B and C). In the RTPCR product from T47DtTA/p27m cells, the ERM tag was fused inframe with the second exon of p27, indicating that the 337-bp
intron sequence between the splice donor site of the ERM tag and
the second exon of p27 was excised during RNA processing
(Fig. 1B). Accordingly, the inserted ERM promoter generated a
10-kDa protein that was recognized by antibodies against p27
COOH terminus and ERM tag, indicating that this fusion protein
contains ERM tag (62 amino acids) and the COOH-terminal
40 amino acids of p27 (p27-C40; Fig. 1D and data not shown). The
p27 NH2-terminal antibody recognized a smaller and less abundant
protein in T47DtTA/p27m cells than the full-length p27 in T47DtTA
cells (Fig. 1D). Because this smaller p27 protein was not detectable

www.aacrjournals.org

by the p27 COOH-terminal antibody and its apparent molecular
mass (f10 kDa) matched the predicted size translated from exon
1 and its extending intron sequence, we concluded that ERM
insertion in the p27 intron interfered the splicing between exons 1
and 2. This resulted in a truncated p27 protein with the NH2terminal 158 amino acids and the COOH-terminal 21 amino acids
encoded by the extended intron sequence before meeting the TAA
stop codon at 63 to 65 bp of intron 1 (Fig. 1B and D). This NH2terminal protein was designated as p27-N158. Interestingly, no
wild-type p27 allele and full-length p27 protein were detected in
T47DtTA/p27m cells by PCR and immunoblotting (Fig. 1C and D),
indicating that T47D cells only contain a single p27 wild-type allele
and T47DtTA/p27m cells only contain a disrupted p27 allele.
T47DtTA/p27m cells are resistant to antiestrogens although
they still express functional ERA. To test whether disruption of
p27 reduces the antiproliferative effects of antiestrogens, we
compared cell proliferation rates of T47DtTA/p27m cells and T47DtTA
cells treated with 4-OH-tamoxifen and ICI 182780 for 4 days. The
vehicle-treated T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells exhibited similar
S-phase fractions (f10%), whereas 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment
reduced the S-phase fraction of T47DtTA cells to f3%. However,
4-OH-tamoxifen treatment only slightly decreased the S-phase
fraction of T47DtTA/p27m cells to 7%. ICI 182780 treatment

diminished the S-phase fraction of T47DtTA cells to f3%, but only
partially reduced the S-phase fraction of T47DtTA/p27m cells to
f5.5%, indicating that T47DtTA/p27m cells were also less sensitive
than T47DtTA cells to ICI 182780 (Fig. 2A). Consistent results were
also obtained from cell growth of T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells
cultured in growth medium containing vehicle, 4-OH-tamoxifen, or
ICI 182780 and in estrogen-free medium with CSFCS (Fig. 2B). To
validate the specific role of p27 in these experiments, we restored
stable p27 expression in T47DtTA/p27m cells by retroviral infection.
The restored p27 was a poly-histidine–tagged bigger protein
compared with the endogenous p27 in T47DtTA cells (Fig. 2B).
Restoration of p27 in T47DtTA/p27m/+p27 cells rescued the growthinhibitory sensitivities of these cells to 4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI 182780,
and CSFCS (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that p27 function is
required for T47D cells to respond to the antiproliferative effects of
antiestrogens.
To examine the long-term effects of antiestrogens on T47DtTA/p27m
cell survival and growth, we compared the colony formation capability
of T47DtTA/p27m cells with that of T47DtTA cells over a 3-week
culture period. In growth medium, T47DtTA/p27m and T47DtTA cells
formed colonies equally well, giving f45 colonies/cm2. 4-OHTamoxifen treatment significantly reduced the density of colonies
formed from T47DtTA cells to 15 colonies/cm2. In contrast, 4-OH-

tamoxifen treatment did not significantly change the colony
formation capability of T47DtTA/p27m cells (Fig. 2C). ICI 182780
treatment profoundly reduced both the number and size of the
colonies formed from T47DtTA cells. However, ICI 182780 reduced only
the colony size of T47DtTA/p27m cells but not their total number of
colonies (Fig. 2C). These results show that T47DtTA/p27m cells are fully
resistant to 4-OH-tamoxifen and partially resistant to ICI 182780.
It is a possibility that loss of ERa causes breast cancer cells to
become insensitive to antiestrogens. However, immunoblotting
analysis revealed that ERa levels in T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells
were comparable. The estradiol-induced or ICI 182780–inhibited
transcriptions of PRA and PRB from the estrogen-responsive PR gene
also were comparable in these cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, the antiestrogen
resistance observed in T47DtTA/p27m cells is not due to a loss of ERa
expression or function.
The p27-N158 and p27-C40 proteins are loss-of-function
mutants. Most p27 immunoreactivity was detected in the nucleus
of T47DtTA cells by p27 NH2-terminal antibody, whereas the p27N158 immunoreactivity was detected in both cytoplasm and
nucleus of T47DtTA/p27m cells with the same antibody (Fig. 3A).
Immunoblotting analyses further identified p27 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of T47DtTA cells; on the contrary, the
mutant p27-N158 was mainly found in the cytoplasmic fraction of

Figure 4. p27 deficiency enhances AIB1 phosphorylation and increases the transcriptional activity of E2F1 and AIB1. A, T47DtTA/p27m cells have higher E2F1
activity compared with T47DtTA cells. E2F1 activity was measured by transfecting cells with an E2F1 luciferase reporter. Transfected cells were cultured in growth
medium containing vehicle, tamoxifen, and ICI 182780 or in medium with 10% CSFCS for 2 d. Transfection efficiency was normalized to h-galactosidase activity, which
was expressed by cotransfecting cells with the pRSV-h-gal vector. Data are presented by setting relative average luciferase activity in CSFCS-treated T47DtTA cells as
1 unit. B, immunoblotting analysis showing comparable AIB1 levels in T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells. Immunoblotting analysis of h-actin serves as a loading control.
C, p27 deficiency and 17h-estradiol (E2 ) enhance AIB1 phosphorylation. T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 17h-estradiol
for 1 h in medium with 10% CSFCS. Total AIB1 was immunoprecipitated with AIB1 antibody and then subjected to immunoblotting analysis with antibodies specific to
the phosphorylation sites as indicated. These antibodies were developed and affinity purified as described (29). Note that the total amount of precipitated AIB1 is
similar among groups but the different sites are differentially phosphorylated. D, mutation of specific phosphorylation sites impairs AIB1 coactivator activity for E2F1mediated target gene transcription. Cells were transfected with E2F1, E2F1-responsive luciferase reporter, and AIB1 or its mutants as indicated. Luciferase activity was
assayed as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean (n = 4; with the first column set as 1 unit); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA.

activity. Gab2 levels in T47DtTA, T47DtTA/p27m, and T47DtTA/p27m/+27 (+27) cells were assayed by immunoblotting. Total Akt and phosphorylated active Akt in these
cells were detected by immunoblotting with respective Akt antibody and phosphorylation site–specific antibody. Akt activity in T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells was
assayed using GSK-3h as substrate and the phosphorylated GSK-3h (p-GSK) was detected by immunoblotting with a phospho-GSK-3h–specific antibody. The h-actin
assay served as a loading control. B, measurement of cell migration. T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells were cultured on plates coated with fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN ),
collagen I (Col I ), or collagen IV (Col IV ), and cell migration was traced by using blue fluorescence beads. Individual cells (arrows ) were stained with rhodaminephalloidin. Dark areas indicate cell migration tracks. Cells migrated faster on fibronectin and collagen IV. C, measurement of migration areas. Cell migration tracks of
25 to 30 cells were analyzed by using NIH image software. Columns, average relative migration area; bars, SD. The migration areas of T47DtTA/p27m cells on all
coated matrices examined are significantly bigger compared with T47DtTA cells (P < 0.01, unpaired t test). D, cell invasion assay. The invasive capability of T47DtTA,
T47DtTA/p27m, and T47DtTA/p27m/+27 in the Matrigel was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD.

T47DtTA/p27m cells (Fig. 3B, top). The latter observation is
consistent with the absence of p27 nuclear localization sequence
(amino acids 159–169) in p27-N158 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate
that although p27-N158 contains the NH2-terminal domains for
binding cyclins and CDKs, it mainly stays in the cytoplasm and
does not function as a nuclear CDK inhibitor.
The nuclear p27 in T47DtTA cells was also detected by the p27
COOH-terminal antibody. Interestingly, the p27-C40, detected by the
same antibody, was mainly found in the cytoplasm of T47DtTA/p27m
cells, although weaker immunoreactivity was also detected in their
nuclei (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting analyses confirmed that p27-C40
was distributed in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of
T47DtTA/p27m cells (Fig. 3B, bottom). Because p27-C40 expression is
controlled by the tetracycline-off ERM promoter, we examined the
effect of p27-C40 on cell proliferation by treating cells with
tetracycline. The p27-C40 level was significantly reduced in
T47DtTA/p27m cells on tetracycline treatment (Fig. 3C). However,
the distribution of cell fractions in all proliferation phases,
determined by flow cytometry, was identical between vehicle- and
tetracycline-treated T47DtTA/p27m cells (data not shown). These
results indicate that change of p27-C40 concentration does not affect
cell proliferation.
p27 deficiency reduces the inhibitory effects of antiestrogens on CDK2 activity. In estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells,
antiestrogens induce p27, inhibit cyclin E-CDK2 activity, reduce Rb
and Rb-related p130 hyperphosphorylation, suppress E2F, and
arrest cell cycle at G1 (16). In T47DtTA cells, 4-OH-tamoxifen
induced a slight, and ICI 182780 and estrogen-free condition
induced a significant, p27 increase. In T47DtTA/p27m cells, these

www.aacrjournals.org

treatments failed to induce p27-N158 levels, suggesting that
antiestrogens or estrogen-free conditions do not induce p27
promoter activity in the estrogen-independent T47DtTA/p27m cells.
The level of p27-C40 was decreased when T47DtTA/p27m cells were
cultured in estrogen-free medium, due presumably to lower ERM
promoter activity under this culture condition (Fig. 3D and data now
shown). Cyclin E and CDK2 levels were identical between T47DtTA
and T47DtTA/p27m cells under all examined conditions (Fig. 3D).
To examine the effect of p27 mutation on the kinase activity of
cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, cyclin E was immunoprecipitated from
cell extracts with equal protein amount and the kinase activity of
precipitates was assayed using histone H1 as substrate. The cyclin
E–associated CDK2 kinase activity was reduced by 33% and 66%,
respectively, when T47DtTA cells were treated with 4-OHtamoxifen and ICI 182780. When T47DtTA cells were cultured in
estrogen-free medium, the cyclin E–associated CDK2 kinase
activity was reduced by 87%. In contrast, the cyclin E-CDK2
kinase activity in T47DtTA/p27m cells was not significantly reduced
with 4-OH-tamoxifen and only reduced by 37% and 57% with ICI
182780 and estrogen-free medium (Fig. 3D). In agreement with
the increase of CDK2 activity, the ratios of hyperphosphorylated
Rb to hypophosphorylated Rb were increased in T47DtTA/p27m
cells treated with 4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI 182780, and estrogen-free
medium compared with the ratios of hyperphosphorylated Rb to
hypophosphorylated Rb in T47DtTA cells receiving the same treatments (Fig. 3D). Similarly, the ratios of hyperphosphorylated p130 to
hypophosphorylated p130 in T47DtTA/p27m cells treated with 4-OHtamoxifen, ICI 182780, and estrogen-free medium were higher than
the ratios of hyperphosphorylated p130 to hypophosphorylated

p130 in T47DtTA cells (Fig. 3D). The increase in these ratios was
mainly due to the decrease in the hypophosphorylated inhibitory
forms of Rb and p130. These results indicate that p27 deficiency
desensitizes the inhibition of CDK2 activity by antiestrogens and
estrogen depletion, causing sustained hyperphosphorylation and
inactivation of tumor suppressors including hypophosphorylated
Rb and p130, even in the presence of antiestrogens or in the absence
of estrogen.
Loss of p27 stimulates AIB1 phosphorylation and E2F1
transcriptional activity. The elevated CDK2 activity is known to
activate E2F transcriptional activity, which plays an essential role in
G1-S transition of the cell cycle. To measure E2F1 activity, we
transfected T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells with an E2F1responsive luciferase reporter and measured the luciferase activity.
The reporter activity was f2-fold higher in T47DtTA/p27m cells
compared with T47DtTA cells when these cells were treated with
vehicle, 4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI 182780, or estrogen-free medium
(Fig. 4A). These results indicate that p27 deficiency significantly
stimulates E2F1 activity in T47DtTA/p27m cells.
AIB1 is a strong coactivator for E2F1 and plays an important role
in breast cancer proliferation and antiestrogen resistance (22, 23,
36, 37). Because AIB1 cellular concentration and phosphorylation
levels determine its coactivator activity, we assessed if p27
deficiency would alter AIB1 protein level and/or phosphorylation
status using specific antibodies detecting total AIB1 and its
individual phosphorylated sites known to be important for its
coactivator activity (29). Whereas total AIB1 remained unchanged
in T47DtTA/p27m cells compared with T47DtTA cells (Fig. 4B and C),
its phosphorylation levels on five of the six known sites, with the
exception of Ser543, were significantly enhanced in T47DtTA/p27m
cells, including phosphorylated Thr24 (pT24) and phosphorylated
Ser505 (pS505), pS857, pS860, and pS867 in the absence of estrogen
treatment (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, 17h-estradiol treatment stimulated the phosphorylation of these sites in T47DtTA cells but not in

T47DtTA/p27m cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the phosphorylation
levels of these sites induced by p27 deficiency are similar to the
levels induced by estrogen in T47DtTA cells.
Next, we analyzed the effect of each AIB1 phosphorylation site
on E2F1 reporter by comparing the coactivator activity of AIB1
with its mutants containing a threonine (T) or serine (S) to alanine
(A) mutation. These mutant and wild-type AIB1 vectors showed
similar expression levels in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells
were used because they gave a better efficiency than T47D cells
when multiple plasmids were cotransfected. Our experiments
showed that expression of E2F1 or AIB1 alone had limited
stimulation on E2F1 reporter activity, but coexpression of E2F1
and AIB1 robustly potentiated E2F reporter activity (Fig. 4D).
Expression of the T24A, S505A, S543A, and S860A AIB1 mutants
also coactivated E2F1 activity as wild-type AIB1 did. Nevertheless,
coactivator activities were partially impaired for the S867A mutant
and completely diminished for the S857A mutant (Fig. 4D). These
results suggest that phosphorylation on two of the six sites of AIB1
has a positive effect on E2F1-mediated transcription. Because
disruption of p27 increased the phosphorylation on five of the six
known sites including pS857 and pS867, the hyperphosphorylated
AIB1 in T47DtTA/p27m cells should serve as a stronger coactivator
for E2F1 compared with the hypophosphorylated AIB1 in T47DtTA
cells.
Disruption of p27 increases Akt activity. The adaptor protein
Gab2 is a direct E2F target (30). Indeed, Gab2 was significantly
increased in T47DtTA/p27m cells compared with T47DtTA cells;
restoration of p27 caused a reversible decrease in Gab2 in
T47DtTA/p27m/+27 cells (Fig. 5A). The E2F-induced Gab2 plays an
essential role in mediating E2F-dependent activation of the PI3K/
Akt signaling pathway in U-2OS osteosarcoma cells (30). To address
whether p27 deficiency–induced hyperactive E2F and overexpressed
Gab2 would also potentiate Akt activation in breast cancer cells,
we assayed total Akt and active Akt, the phospho-Ser473-Akt

A Role of p27 in Breast Cancer Progression

(pS473-Akt; ref. 38), by immunoblotting. The total Akt was
comparable in T47DtTA/p27m and T47DtTA cells (Fig. 5A). However,
the pS473-Akt was f3-fold higher in T47DtTA/p27m cells than in
T47DtTA cells. Restoration of p27 in T47DtTA/p27/+27 cells did not
change total Akt but decreased active Akt (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, Akt
protein immunopurified from T47DtTA/p27m cells showed higher
kinase activity than Akt from T47DtTA cells as determined by in vitro
kinase assays using glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3h as substrate
(ref. 39; Fig. 5A). These results show that inactivation of p27 in T47D
cells causes superactivation of Akt, probably by enhancing the
transcriptional capability of E2F.
Inactivation of p27 promotes cell mobility and invasion. The
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in cancer cell
motility, invasion, and metastasis (31, 32). To assess the effects of
p27 deficiency–triggered Akt activation on cell motility, we
measured the extent of individual cell migration on extracellular
matrix proteins by using blue fluorescent beads to determine the
track area cells had moved through in 18 h. On culture plates
coated with each of the four extracellular matrix proteins, the
track area of T47DtTA/p27m cells was significantly larger than the
track area of T47DtTA cells (Fig. 5B). Quantitative analysis of
the track areas revealed that T47DtTA/p27m cells migrated 2.1-, 4.6-,
4.5-, and 3-fold faster than T47DtTA cells on fibronectin-, laminin-,
collagen I–, and collagen IV–coated culture plates, respectively
(Fig. 5C). These results indicate that inactivation of p27 in T47D
cells remarkably promotes cell motility.
We also evaluated the capability of T47DtTA, T47DtTA/p27m, and
T47DtTA/p27m/+p27 cells to invade through the extracellular matrix
by using Matrigel Invasion Chambers. The average number of
T47DtTA/p27m cells that invaded through the Matrigel layer
increased >3-fold compared with T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m/+p27
cells (Fig. 5D ). These results indicate that p27 deficiency
significantly enhances the invasive capability of breast cancer cells.
T47DtTA/p27m and T47DtTA cells showed similar cell adhesion
capability on fibronectin-, laminin-, collagen I–, or collagen IV–
coated culture plates (data not shown). Immunoblotting and
immunocytochemistry revealed that the levels and distribution
patterns of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker for mammary
epithelial association (40), were similar between T47DtTA and
T47DtTA/p27m cells (data not shown). These results indicate that p27
deficiency does not alter E-cadherin expression and location as
well as mammary epithelial cell-cell interaction.
I.v. injection of p27-deficient T47DtTA/p27m cells induces lung
metastasis in ovariectomized nude mice. T47D cells are
estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cells, which can only
form nonmetastatic local tumors in ovariectomized nude mice
treated with estrogen (35). To test whether p27 deficiency in
estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells could promote tumor
formation in an ovarian hormone–independent manner, we
compared tumor development and progression of T47DtTA/p27m
cells with T47DtTA cells in ovariectomized nude mice. Both
T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells developed local tumors in the
mammary fat pats of all nude mice (n = 6) treated with estradiol
pellets, but failed to develop tumors in the mammary fat pads
of nude mice treated with placebo (Fig. 6A and data not shown).
Histologic examination revealed that T47DtTA tumors had a
smooth surface and a relatively tight cell-cell association (Fig. 6A).
In contrast, the edge of T47DtTA/p27m tumors frequently protruded
into the surrounding stromal tissues (Fig. 6A). These results
suggest that loss of p27 function may make T47DtTA/p27m tumors
more invasive.

www.aacrjournals.org

To address if the local tumors formed from T47DtTA/p27m cells
might develop systemic metastasis, we examined the lung and
other internal organs of mice bearing T47DtTA/p27m tumors in their
mammary fat pats. However, we did not find any metastasis that
developed in any secondary organs, suggesting that T47DtTA/p27m
tumors formed in the mammary gland are unable to accomplish
the entire process of distant metastasis.
To determine whether p27 deficiency–induced cellular alterations could potentiate metastasis of breast cancer cells after
intravasation, we compared the capability of T47DtTA/p27m cells
with that of T47DtTA cells to form metastatic tumors in the lung
using a well-established experimental metastasis method (41).
T47DtTA cells did not develop any tumors in the lung of
ovariectomized nude mice (n = 5) 3 weeks after injection i.v.
(Fig. 6C). In contrast, all of the seven ovariectomized nude mice
developed lung tumors 3 weeks after receiving T47DtTA/p27m cells
i.v. In these mice lacking ovarian steroids, many tumors were
visible on the lung surfaces, and big invasive tumors were observed
on lung sections (Fig. 6B and C). In these tumor cells, strong
immunoreactivity of p27-C40 was detected in the cytoplasm, which
was similar to that seen in T47DtTA/p27m cells in Fig. 3A. In
addition, the mammary epithelial marker K8 was also detected in
the lung tumor cells of nude mice injected with T47DtTA/p27m cells,
but not in the lung of nude mice injected with T47DtTA cells
(Fig. 6D), indicating that these metastatic tumors originated from
T47DtTA/p27m cells. These results show that loss of p27 in T47D
estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells is sufficient to permit
metastatic tumor formation in the lung in an ovarian hormone–
independent manner, once these tumor cells enter the circulation.

Discussion
Development of estrogen independence and tamoxifen resistance is a major problem in breast cancer endocrine therapy.
Characterization of the genetic changes responsible for the
transition from estrogen dependence to estrogen independence
and from tamoxifen responsiveness to tamoxifen resistance is
essential for understanding the mechanisms for this key step in
progression. In this study, we found that the estrogen-dependent
T47D cells contain only one p27 allele, suggesting that p27 is
already decreased in the original T47D tumor. Our genome-wide
screening using ERM identified the p27-deficient T47DtTA/p27m cells
that still express functional ERa but grow in an estrogenindependent manner and are fully resistant to tamoxifen. These
observations recapitulate the similar features of ERa-positive
breast cancers that progress from tamoxifen sensitive to tamoxifen
resistant and are consistent with an important role of p27
reduction and cytoplasmic retention in breast cancer initiation
and progression (13–15, 17–19). Because our results show that
disruption of p27 is sufficient to permit estrogen-dependent and
tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer cells to grow in the absence of
estrogen and in the presence of tamoxifen and that these growth
phenotypes can be rescued by p27 restoration, we conclude that
functional p27 is required for tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of
ERa-positive breast cancer growth.
T47DtTA/p27m cells also exhibited a partial resistance to ICI
182780 compared with T47DtTA cells. ICI 182780 only reduced
the size of T47DtTA/p27m cell colonies and inhibited 37% of CDK2
activity. Previous studies have shown that both p27 and p21cip1
can contribute to antiestrogen-mediated cell cycle arrest in
breast cancer cells (18). Our analyses also reveal that p21 is more

obviously induced by ICI 182780 in T47DtTA/p27m cells than in
T47DtTA cells and more cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 were
associated with p21cip1 in T47DtTA/p27m cells (data not shown).
Therefore, the partial ICI 182780 resistance of T47DtTA/p27m cells
may be accredited to the compensatory role of p21cip1 when p27
function is lost.
E2F1 transcriptional activity is significantly elevated in T47DtTA/
p27m
cells because p27 deficiency activates CDK2, leading to Rb
phosphorylation and E2F1 activation. Recently, AIB1 has been
identified as a major coactivator for E2F1; E2F1 interacts with
AIB1 NH2 terminus and recruits AIB1 to the promoter of E2F1
target gene (22). Other studies also have shown that growth
factors, cytokines, and estrogen can stimulate AIB1 phosphorylation at specific sites and AIB1 phosphorylation usually alters AIB1
coactivator activity for steroid receptors (29, 42). Nevertheless, the
mechanisms leading to AIB1 phosphorylation are complex and
many kinases including p38, InB kinases, extracellular signal–
regulated kinase, c-jun NH2-terminal kinase, and GSKs have been
shown to phosphorylate AIB1 (29). Because CDK2 and Akt are
stimulated in p27-deficient T47DtTA/p27 cells, these two kinases
might also play a role in AIB1 phosphorylation. Our data show
that loss of p27 in T47DtTA/p27m cells enhances AIB1 phosphorylation on five of the six mapped sites, and the phosphorylation
on four of these five sites was also enhanced by estrogen in
T47DtTA cells (Fig. 5C), suggesting that p27 deficiency causes an
AIB1 phosphorylation pattern similar to that caused by estrogen.
Importantly, mutation of two of these sites (S857 and S867) either
attenuated or diminished AIB1 coactivator activity for E2F1.
These results indicate that the phosphorylated AIB1 is a better
coactivator for E2F1. Thus, p27 deficiency–induced AIB1 phosphorylation further potentiates E2F1 target gene transcription
following CDK2 activation and Rb phosphorylation. This double
enhancement of E2F1 activity may play a crucial role in breast
cancer progression into estrogen independence and tamoxifen
resistance.
Intriguingly, T47DtTA/p27m cells can grow in estrogen-free
medium but are unable to develop tumors in the mammary fat
pads of ovariectomized nude mice with or without tamoxifen
treatment, suggesting that tumor formation in the mammary fat
pads in the absence of ovarian hormones is more difficult than cell
growth in estrogen-free medium for T47DtTA/p27m cells. With
estrogen replacement, both T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m cells
developed solid tumors in the mammary fat pads. Although
T47DtTA/p27m tumors are morphologically more invasive, both
T47DtTA and T47DtTA/p27m tumors formed in the mammary fat
pads are not metastatic, suggesting that p27 deficiency alone is not
sufficient for these tumor cells to progress into fully metastatic
cancer cells.
The next question is why T47DtTA/p27m cells lacking p27, but
not T47DtTA cells with p27, develop lung metastasis when
injected into the circulation of ovariectomized mice. To develop
lung metastasis, tumor cells, after intravasation or injection into
the circulation, must attach to the endothelium of small lung
vessels, migrate or invade through the vessel wall, and form
tumors in the lung (41). Our analyses show that T47DtTA and
T47DtTA/p27m cells have similar adhesion capability to extracellular matrix proteins, suggesting that p27 deficiency does not
change cell adhesion properties and the increase in T47DtTA/p27m
cell metastatic potential is unlikely due to the change of
endothelial attachment. On the other hand, cell migration and
invasion abilities are correlated with metastasis. Our data show

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

that p27 deficiency in T47DtTA/p27m cells dramatically promotes
their motility and invasiveness compared with T47DtTA cells.
Thus, p27 deficiency–induced increase in cell motility and
invasion may be responsible for the ability of T47DtTA/p27m cells
to develop lung metastasis.
The mechanisms for p27 deficiency–induced cell motility,
invasiveness, and lung metastasis may be very complex. We
showed that T47DtTA/p27m cells have an enhanced AIB1 phosphorylation, which makes AIB1 a stronger coactivator for E2F1.
Previous studies have established that E2F1 strongly activates
Akt through a direct up-regulation of Gab2 expression (30). In this
study, p27 deficiency in T47DtTA/p27m cells indeed increases E2F1
transcriptional activity, Gab2 protein, and Akt activation following
AIB1 phosphorylation. Akt plays a central role in cancer cell
motility, invasion, and metastasis (31, 32). Therefore, p27
deficiency–enhanced AIB1 phosphorylation may significantly
contribute to cell motility, invasion, and metastasis by activating
Akt. This interpretation is consistent with the lower Akt activity
and less lung metastasis of the mammary gland tumors induced by
oncogenes and carcinogens in AIB1-null mice compared with wildtype mice (27, 28).
Furthermore, it has been shown that overexpression of a p27
cytosolic mutant increases total Akt by inhibiting its turnover (43).
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the disrupted p27 fragments in
T47DtTA/p27m cells can play the same role that the full-length
cytosolic p27 mutant does because there is no change in total Akt
in T47DtTA/p27m cells. In addition, p27 deficiency may release its
direct inhibition on cell motility. Although p27 has been reported
as both an inhibitor and a stimulator of cell migration (44–47),
a recent article has suggested that the controversial observations
about the role of p27 in cell motility may be due to the type of cell
motility assayed (48). This study showed that p27 binds and
impairs the function of the microtubule-destabilizing protein
stathmin and thereby plays an inhibitory role in amoeboid cell
migration, a type of cell movement used by tumor cells in
tissues (48). Disruption of p27 in T47DtTA/p27m cells may impair
the direct inhibitory role of p27 in cell motility and tumor cell
metastasis. Finally, down-regulation of p27 causes an upregulation of G protein–coupled receptor 48 (GPR48), and
GPR48 can enhance cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis (49).
Therefore, multiple pathways may be involved in the p27
deficiency–induced increase in breast cancer cell motility,
invasiveness, and metastasis.
Although p27 null mutations are rare, f50% human tumors
exhibit decreased p27. The p27 reduction and cytoplasmic
mislocalization correlate with more aggressive phenotypes, including HER2/neu overexpression, high proliferating indices, active
invasive behavior, and high mortality (13–15, 50). These observations suggest that p27 abundance inversely correlates with breast
cancer progression. However, studies using transgenic mice
suggest that a threshold of p27 seems to be required for normal
mammary epithelial proliferation and mammary tumorigenesis
induced by oncoproteins. For example, p27+/ mice exhibit a faster
mammary epithelial growth and mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV)-neu–induced tumorigenesis, but p27 / mice exhibit a
delayed mammary gland morphogenesis and MMTV-neu–induced
tumorigenesis (21). Molecular analysis suggests that certain p27 is
required for stabilization of cyclin D1 and assembly and nuclear
translocation of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes. Thus, CDK4 in p27 /
mammary epithelial cells cannot be activated, which in turn
suppresses the neu-induced, cyclin D1-dependent mammary

epithelial transformation (21). Similarly, cyclin D1 is decreased and
CDK4 activity is reduced manyfold in our T47DtTA/p27m cells (data
not shown). However, T47DtTA/p27m cells exhibit comparable
proliferation as T47DtTA cells when cultured in growth medium.
These results indicate that T47DtTA/p27m cells are no longer
dependent on cyclin D1-CDK4 for survival and growth. Although
it is unknown whether the T47D parent tumor has acquired cyclin
D1-CDK4–independent growth, the increase in cyclin E-CDK2
activity after loss of p27 in T47DtTA/p27m cells is cyclin D1-CDK4
independent and should be responsible for the antiestrogen
insensitivity of these cells.
Based on this and previous studies discussed above, the effect of
p27 gene dosage on breast cancer is likely dependent on the
specific stages of tumor initiation and progression. It seems
reasonable to propose that p27 reduction in the mammary
epithelium and early stages of tumorigenesis may promote cell
proliferation and accelerate hormone-, oncoprotein-, and carcinogen-induced transformation while still maintaining cyclin D1

and CDK4 activity. Once these transformed cells acquire a cyclin
D1-CDK4–independent growth feature, a further reduction or loss
or mislocalization of p27 may facilitate breast tumor cells to
develop more aggressive cancer phenotypes including estrogenindependent growth, antiestrogen insensitivity, and metastasis.
During this process, p27 insufficiency– or p27 deficiency–induced
increase in AIB1, E2F1, Gab2, and Akt activities and decrease in p27
inhibitory role in cell motility may have a major contribution to
breast cancer progression.
