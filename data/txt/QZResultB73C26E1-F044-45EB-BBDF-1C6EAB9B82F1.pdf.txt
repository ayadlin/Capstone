BACKGROUND. Effective chemotherapy is lacking for most types of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children. Temozolomide, an agent with activity
against adult brain tumors, was investigated in children and adolescents with
recurrent CNS tumors.

METHODS. Temozolomide was administered orally as monthly 5-day courses at
doses of 200 mg/m2/d (patients with no prior craniospinal irradiation [CSI]) or
180 mg/m2/d (prior CSI). Patients with a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response
or stable disease (SD) could continue temozolomide for up to 12 cycles.

RESULTS. The cohort comprised 122 patients, including 113 with CNS tumors.
Median age was 11 years (range, 1–23 years). Among 104 evaluable patients with
CNS tumors, 5 PRs and 1 CR were observed. PRs occurred in 1 of 23 evaluable
patients with high-grade astrocytoma, 1 of 21 with low-grade astrocytoma, and 3
of 25 with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). The CR

entral nervous system (CNS) tumors represent
approximately 17% of all pediatric cancers and
are the most common solid tumors in children. Current treatment strategies afford overall survival rates
below 70% for the combined group of patients with
all types of CNS tumors.1 Worse outcomes are
observed for patients with high-grade astrocytomas,
brain-stem gliomas, and primitive neuroectodermal
tumors (PNET).1,2 Although surgery and radiotherapy
are used for many CNS tumors, chemotherapy
is now routinely used in the treatment of patients
with medulloblastomas, low-grade astrocytomas,
and germinomas.3 To further enhance survival, additional effective chemotherapeutic agents are needed
urgently.
Temozolomide is a second-generation member
of the imidazotetrazine class of alkylating agents
with activity against a broad spectrum of human
cancer cell lines and xenografts.4–6 In addition, temozolomide is widely distributed throughout the body
and penetrates the blood-brain barrier in animals
and humans.7–9 Interest in temozolomide as a chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of CNS tumors
was motivated by preclinical studies that showed activity against several subcutaneous and intracerebral
human brain tumor xenografts,10,11 as well as numerous phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in adults that demonstrated activity of temozolomide administered orally
for 5 days every 28 days at doses of 150–200 mg/
m2 per day against malignant astrocytomas and
gliomas.12–22
Prior phase 1 and 2 studies in children also supported the potential activity of temozolomide against
recurrent pediatric tumors of the central nervous system.20,23,24 In a Children’s Cancer Group phase 1
study of children with recurrent solid tumors, maximum tolerable doses (MTDs) of temozolomide for
those who had received or not received prior craniospinal radiation were 180 mg/m2/d for 5 days or
215 mg/m2/d for 5 days, respectively.20 In a United
Kingdom phase 1 trial, an MTD of 200 mg/m2/d for
5 days was reported for children with advanced
malignancies, including CNS tumors, who had not
received prior craniospinal radiation or nitrosourea.23
We conducted this Children’s Oncology Group phase
2 study of temozolomide in children and adolescents
with recurrent tumors of the central nervous system
to define its activity on the daily 35 days schedule.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligible patients were younger than 22 years of age
at original diagnosis and had recurrent or progressive

1543

CNS tumors that were measurable by radiographic or
histologic criteria, refractory to standard therapy,
and, with the exception of brain-stem tumors, histologically confirmed at initial diagnosis. Eligible
tumors included the 5 major classes of childhood
CNS tumors (high-grade astrocytoma, low-grade
astrocytoma, medulloblastoma/PNET, ependymoma,
and brain-stem glioma), as well as other CNS
tumors. Patients must not have received more than 2
prior chemotherapy regimens, must have fully recovered from all prior therapies, and must not have
received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy for at
least 2 weeks before study entry (6 weeks since nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Other eligibility criteria
included adequate functioning of the bone marrow,
kidneys, liver, lung, and CNS, determined as follows:
platelet count 100,000/mm3; neutrophil count
1000/mm3; serum creatinine 1.5 times normal, or
glomerular filtration rate 70 mL/min/1.73 m2; serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) 2.5 times normal; bilirubin
1.5 times normal; no dyspnea at rest; no exercise
intolerance; pulse oxymetry >94% for patients in
whom clinical indication was indicated; seizures
under good control; and no pre-existing CNS toxicity
greater than grade 2, except for grade 3 cerebellar
dysfunction. Patients must have had a life expectancy of at least 2 months, an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2,
and the ability to swallow capsules. Menstruating
females and those who were at least 13 years old had
to have negative pregnancy tests before enrollment
and had to agree to avoid becoming pregnant while
on study. Informed consent was provided by patients
or their legal guardians, and the protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at all participating centers. The study conformed to Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and National Cancer
Institute (NCI) guidelines for human subjects’ protection.

Study Design
This multicenter phase 2 study was designed to estimate level of activity, as defined by reduction in tumor size, of temozolomide against the major types of
childhood CNS tumors, when given for 5 consecutive
days. No dose escalations were allowed. Patients
were stratified according to their prior radiation
treatment. Patients who had prior craniospinal irradiation (CSI) were treated with daily doses of
180 mg/m2/d for 5 days, and those who had no prior
CSI were treated with daily doses of 200 mg/m2/d
for 5 days. Up to 11 subsequent courses were given
every 28 days to patients who showed clinical benefit

(SD, PR, or CR) after 2 courses and resolution of all
toxicities.
The following assessments were performed on
Day 0 of each treatment course, physical examination, laboratory parameters (complete blood count
[CBC], AST, ALT, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, and
creatinine), and adverse events. CBCs were also
taken weekly during the first course and on Day 21
of subsequent courses. Safety assessments were performed more often, if clinically indicated.
No concomitant cancer chemotherapy, immunomodulating agents, or radiotherapy were allowed, but
patients were given antibiotics, blood products,
antiemetics, and other supportive care as clinically
indicated. Cytokine support was not allowed, but
patients could be given corticosteroid therapy for
increased intracranial pressure, and they could
receive anticonvulsant therapy.

Evaluation of Response
Response was initially evaluated after the first 2
courses and then after every second course. Tumor
was measured in 2 perpendicular dimensions radiographically, and response was determined by comparison of the measurements of the same lesion at
the time of study entry and at follow-up. CR was
defined as the disappearance of all known lesions for
at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as a reduction of at
least 50% in the sums of the products of the largest
diameters of measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks.
SD was defined as a decrease of <50% reduction or
an increase of <25% in the sums of the products of
the largest diameters of measurable lesions, with no
appearance of new lesions. Finally, progressive disease was defined as a 25% increase in the sums of
the products of the largest diameters of measurable
lesions or the development of new lesions.
Study Drug
Temozolomide (Temodar, Schering-Plough Research
Institute, Kenilworth, NJ) was supplied as white opaque, preservative-free, hard gelatin capsules at
strengths of 250 mg, 100 mg, 20 mg, and 5 mg. All
patients received temozolomide orally for 5 consecutive days at the doses given above. Doses were
rounded to the nearest 5 mg. Temozolomide was
given after an overnight fast, with cessation of eating
for at least 2 hours after study drug administration.
Twenty-five percent reductions in doses were
required in patients with any grade 4 hematologic
toxicities or any grade 3 hematologic toxicities that
delayed treatment. On the basis of minimal nonhematological toxicities in the Children’s Oncology
Group (COG) phase 1 study,20 no dose modification

criteria for nonhematological toxicities were specified
in the study protocol.

Statistical Considerations
Response rates and confidence intervals were constructed according to the method of Chang and
O’Brien.12,18,19,21 A 2-stage design was used for
enrollment into each of the 5 major disease strata as
described here. For each stratum, 10 patients were to
be enrolled and evaluated. If there were no responses
in the first 10 patients, enrollment would be stopped,
and temozolomide would be declared inactive in that
stratum. If there were 7 or more responses in a stratum, enrollment would be stopped, and temozolomide would be declared active in that stratum. If 1
to 6 responses were observed, 10 more patients
would be enrolled. Each stratum was planned to
enroll a maximum of 20 patients considered evaluable for response. If 3 or more responses were
observed among the second cohort of 10 patients,
the drug would be declared effective. For each disease stratum, this design provided a 5% chance of
wrongly declaring temozolomide inactive if the true
response rate was 30% and a 7% chance of wrongly
declaring temozolomide active if the response rate
was 5%.

RESULTS
One hundred twenty-two subjects with recurrent
tumors were enrolled by member institutions of the
COG between January 1998 and November 1999. One
patient with a malignant meningioma was deemed
not eligible because of lack of measurable disease.
Demographic and disease characteristics are shown
in Table 1. Of the 121 enrolled and eligible patients,
113 had CNS tumors, the majority of which were cerebral PNET/medulloblastomas and high-grade or
low-grade astrocytomas. Eight enrolled patients had
other solid tumors during a short interval at the beginning of the study when enrollment was not limited to CNS tumors subjects. The majority of patients
were Caucasian and had been diagnosed at younger
than age 15 years; most had received prior radiotherapy, and approximately half were female. The median age of the cohort was 11 years (range, 1–23 years)
(Table 1).

Overall Response Data
Response data for the 113 eligible patients with CNS
tumors are shown in Table 2. Of the 113 patients,
104 were evaluable for response. Nine patients were
not considered evaluable for response because 1) the
patient was not eligible (1 patient); 2) the patient

occurred in the medulloblastoma/PNET stratum
(Table 2). Response data for each disease stratum are
described below. In addition, 35 (34%) of the 104
evaluable patients had periods of SD after 2 to 12
courses of temozolomide. A longer duration of SD
was particularly notable for patients with low-grade
astrocytoma (see below).

High-grade astrocytoma
Among 23 patients with high-grade astrocytoma, 8
had anaplastic astrocytoma, 4 had glioblastoma multiforme, and 11 had unspecified high-grade astrocytoma. All were evaluable for response. One patient
showed a PR. This patient, an 18-year-old boy with a
recurrent spinal cord anaplastic astrocytoma following surgery and radiotherapy, had a PR after his second course. His response was sustained through 6
additional courses, but he developed PD following
course 9. In addition, a transient response (77% tumor reduction) was noted in a 19-year-old girl with
high-grade astrocytoma after 2 courses, but the
required 4-week follow-up evaluation was not provided, and 6 weeks after the initial evaluation, she
experienced PD. Thus, temozolomide was not effective against high-grade astrocytoma. Notably, however, 7 (30%) patients had SD for at least 2 courses
before disease progression was observed: 3 patients
with anaplastic astrocytoma progressed after 4, 7,
and 8 courses; and 4 patients with high-grade astrocytoma progressed after 3, 5, 6, and 9 courses. All
patients with glioblastoma multiforme had disease
progression after 2 courses of temozolomide.

Low-grade astrocytoma
Twenty-one of the 22 patients with low-grade astrocytoma were evaluable for response. Among patients
with specific histological diagnoses reported, all but
1 were reported to have pilocytic astrocytoma,
including the patient who demonstrated a response.
This patient, a 20-year-old male, had a PR that was
observed after the third course. This response was
sustained through a fourth course, but his disease
progressed after the fifth course. No other responses
were observed; thus, temozolomide did not show activity in low-grade astrocytoma according to the protocol definition of efficacy. Nevertheless, the number
of patients with low-grade astrocytoma who had prolonged SD was striking: Nine (41%) patients maintained SD through 12 courses; 1 patient maintained
SD through 11 courses (the 12th course was not given
to this patient because of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia associated with an antiplatelet antibody
after the 11th course); and 2 patients maintained SD
through 10 courses. Two additional patients had SD
after 2 courses, but they progressed after 4 courses.
Medulloblastoma/PNET
Twenty-five of the 29 patients with medulloblastoma/PNET were evaluable for response. The overall
response rate was 16% and comprised 1 (4%) complete and 3 (12%) partial responses. The CR was
observed in a 3-year-old girl with medulloblastoma
after 4 courses; she subsequently developed PD. The
PRs were observed in a 14-year-old boy with PNET, a
2-year-old boy with medulloblastoma, and a 5-yearold girl with pineoblastoma. In the 14-year-old, the
PR was observed after 2 courses and was sustained
through a third course, but he progressed after the
fourth course. In the 2-year-old, the PR was observed
after 6 courses and was sustained until the end of
the 12th cycle, after which disease progression was
observed. In the 5-year-old, the PR was observed after the fourth course, which was sustained until she
had PD after the eighth course. One additional
patient, a 10-year-old boy, had a tumor reduction of
>90% after 2 courses, but he developed PD after
course 4. No evaluations of response were performed
between courses 2 and 4, thus the initial response
was not confirmed at 4 weeks and did not meet our
protocol criteria for response. Seven patients had SD
after 2 courses; 4 of these patients progressed after 4
courses, 2 progressed after 6 courses, and 1 progressed after 8 courses.
Ependymoma
Twelve of 14 patients with ependymoma were evaluable for response, and no responses were observed.

Moreover, only 5 patients had SD after the second
course, and all evaluable patients had disease progression by the end of the seventh course.

Brain-stem gliomas
Fifteen of the 16 patients with brain stem glioma
were evaluable for response. No responses were
observed, and only 6 patients had SD after 2 cycles.
All patients had progressive disease by the end of the
fifth cycle.
Other CNS tumors
Nine patients with other CNS tumors (4 with mixed
gliomas, 4 with oligodendroglioma, and 1 with an
optic glioma) were enrolled. One patient with an oligodendroglioma was not evaluable. All 8 evaluable
patients progressed, although 1 patient, a 2-year-old
girl with a mixed glioma, maintained SD through 12
courses.
Toxicities
Temozolomide was well tolerated by patients in this
study. Among the 121 eligible patients, 117 received
the first course, and 89 received more than 2 courses
(mean, 4 courses; median, 2 courses; range, 1–12
courses). During the first course of therapy, 25% of
patients had confirmed grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and 19% of patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (Table 3). Only 4% of patients had confirmed
grade 3 or 4 nausea, and only 3% of patients had
grade 3 or 4 vomiting during the first course. Other
nonhematologic toxicities observed during the first
course included grade 1 or 2 AST elevation in 2% of
patients, 1 or 2 ALT elevation in 3%, grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia in 1%, and grade 1 or 2 glucose abnormalities in 2%. No patterns of chronic toxicity emerged
with multiple courses (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In this COG phase 2 study of temozolomide in children with recurrent CNS tumors, we found temozolomide to be modestly active against medulloblastoma/
PNET but not against other major childhood CNS
tumors. However, approximately one-third of all
patients had prolonged periods of stable disease,
which was particularly pronounced in patients with
low-grade astrocytoma, with 12 of 51 (57%) patients
remaining stable through 10 to 12 courses. In addition,
we confirmed the previously reported favorable toxicity profile of temozolomide.12–28 In this study, the
most common toxicities were grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, occurring in 19% and 25% of
patients, respectively, consistent with previous find-

ings. Grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities occurred in 2% of subjects.
The published pediatric literature suggests differential effects of temozolomide for different types of
CNS tumors.20,23–28 Both the Children’s Cancer Group
and the United Kingdom European phase 1 studies
had anecdotal responses and prolonged stable disease in low-grade astrocytomas.20,23 Three partial
and 1 minor response were reported in a study of 13
patients with progressive low-grade glioma,26 and a
recent study of temozolomide in 30 children with

1547

recurrent low-grade astrocytoma showed >50% of
the children with prolonged disease stabilization.29
These results are quite similar to our findings. Varied
responses were reported in 4 studies of patients with
recurrent, advanced, or progressive high-grade glioma; 1 partial response was reported in 10 patients
with recurrent astrocytoma/glioma17; 4 responses
were reported in 34 patients with relapsed or progressive high-grade astrocytoma24; 5 responses (all
partial) were reported in 20 patients with recurrent
high-grade glioma28; and 2 responses (1 complete, 1
partial) were reported in 5 patients with advanced
high-grade astrocytoma who had not received prior
craniospinal irradiation or nitrosourea therapy.23 A
more recent phase 2 study of temozolomide in children and adolescents with recurrent high-grade
astrocytoma had a response rate of 12% (3 of 25),
and a subsequent study by the same group showed a
response rate of 20% among 20 total patients with
high-grade astrocytoma,28 and most responders in
this study had tumors with oligodendroglioma-like
features. Lower response rates were reported for
patients with newly diagnosed diffuse brainstem glioma,23–25,30 and PNET/medulloblastoma.20,27 Two
studies in adults17,31 that reported high response
rates to temozolomide enrolled a small number of
pediatric patients, but results for the pediatric
patients were not reported separately from the those
of the overall cohort. In a phase 2 study of temozolomide in children and adolescents with recurrent
high-grade astrocytoma and brain-stem glioma,24
responses were only seen in 3 (12%) of 25 with highgrade astrocytoma and in 1 (5%) of 18 with brainstem glioma. Taken together, our study and the literature suggest that temozolomide may be less effective in high-grade astrocytomas in children relative
to adults.
In contrast to the equivocal results observed in
children, numerous phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in
adults have demonstrated high activity of temozolomide administered as monthly 5-day courses of 150–
200 mg/m2 per day against malignant astrocytomas
and gliomas,12–19,21,22 although overall response rates
varied from 8% in a study of 138 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme14 to 61% (complete
response, 27%; partial response, 34%) in a study of
46 patients with progressive or recurrent low-grade
glioma, the majority of whom had not received prior
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.31 Although some of
these trials involved relatively small numbers of
patients, the phase 2 study that formed the basis for
marketing approval of temozolomide showed a
response rate of 35% (8% complete responses and
27% partial responses) among 162 patients with

recurrent diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma, or other gliomas,
with no relation between response and prior receipt
of chemotherapy.22 Similarly, a companion phase 2,
randomized, open-label study of temozolomide compared with procarbazine in 225 adults with glioblastoma multiforme at first relapse showed a
significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) for patients who received
temozolomide.32 Temozolomide has now become
widely accepted for the treatment of adults with
high-grade astrocytoma,33–35 and those whose
tumors have methylation of the O6 methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA-repair gene
promoter respond best.36,37 In this regard, children
appear to be similar.38 Only 1 study in adults has
reported a response in a patient with recurrent ependymoma; however, that response was sustained for
at least 2 years after stopping temozolomide.4
A possible factor contributing to the low level of
response observed in the current pediatric study was
the high level of pretreatment experienced by all
patients. Prior exposure to CCNU (lomustine), which
occurred in many of these subjects, may have predisposed these patients not to respond to temozolomide
because of similar host mechanisms of resistance for
both drugs. In vitro data support this hypothesis; in 1
study, 14 of 15 glioma cell lines resistant to CCNU did
not respond to temozolomide,5 and indeed, the single
patient with high-grade astrocytoma who responded
to temozolomide in the current study did not have
prior CCNU exposure. The overall low response rate
also could be due to a need for higher or more frequent dosing in children. The current monthly, 5-day
schedule used in most studies was based on preclinical studies as well as on phase 1 dose-finding studies.
The COG phase 1 study found maximum tolerable
doses of 180 mg/m2/d for 5 days and 200 mg/m2/d for
5 days in children with recurrent malignancies who
had or had not received prior craniospinal radiation,
respectively.20 A similar maximum tolerable dose of
215 mg/m2/d was reported for patients with recurrent
malignancies who had not received craniospinal
radiation or nitrosourea.23 Other schedules of temozolomide, including continuous daily temozolomide for
up to 7 weeks,4,39 and twice daily dosing for 5
days4,39,40 have also been studied. Comparison of
these schedules to the more traditional schedule will
be important in future studies.
The most striking results in the current study
were observed in the group of patients with PNET or
medulloblastoma, as noted above. Few other studies
of pediatric patients have included patients with
such tumors. In the previous COG phase 1 study of

temozolomide,20 the best response was observed in a
child with a recurrent supratentorial PNET, although
no other responses were observed among the other
11 patients with PNET/medulloblastoma in that
study. Similarly, Sterba et al.27 reported 2 complete
responses in patients with high-risk medulloblastomas who had progressed early after neurosurgery.
Taken together, these data suggest that temozolomide may warrant further study in a larger cohort of
patients with PNET/medulloblastoma, perhaps in
combination with other agents, such as platinumbased drugs, vincristine, nitrosoureas, and cyclophosphamide, which have demonstrated activity against
this tumor type.41 In addition, the high percentage of
patients with low-grade astrocytoma who achieved a
prolonged duration of stable disease suggests a possible role for temozolomide in cases where stable
disease may be medically meaningful.2
The current results must be interpreted in the
context of the use of temozolomide as a single agent.
As preclinical studies have suggested that temozolomide may be synergistic with radiotherapy,42 combinations with other drugs that use different
mechanisms of actions, such as inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II, should be pursued, although care
should be taken to ensure that doses and schedules
are based on preclinical data.43 In addition, preclinical data have suggested that O6-benzylguanine, a
substrate of O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase
that can abrogate the resistance to temozolomide
mediated by that enzyme, may be a particularly interesting agent for combination trials,44–46 and early clinical data are also encouraging.47
Finally, although adult studies with larger cohorts
have confirmed a high response to temozolomide for
both low-grade and high-grade astrocytomas and
other gliomas, the overall pediatric data, including
both published and current studies suggest that
temozolomide’s activity may be less robust in children. These observations underscore the need for
caution in extrapolating data from adults to children,
even for similar types of malignancies. In summary,
although objective response rates were low, the current data suggest that temozolomide may warrant
further study for treatment of children with medulloblastoma or other PNETs and that the drug also may
have a role in multidrug regimens for children with
low-grade astrocytoma.
