ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) patients receiving the androgen ablation therapy ultimately
develop recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within 1–3 years.
Treatment with caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) suppressed cell survival and
proliferation via induction of G1 or G2/M cell cycle arrest in LNCaP 104-R1, DU-145,
22Rv1, and C4–2 CRPC cells. CAPE treatment also inhibited soft agar colony formation
and retarded nude mice xenograft growth of LNCaP 104-R1 cells. We identified that
CAPE treatment significantly reduced protein abundance of Skp2, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk7,
Rb, phospho-Rb S807/811, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin H, E2F1, c-Myc, SGK, phosphop70S6kinase T421/S424, phospho-mTOR Ser2481, phospho-GSK3α Ser21, but induced
p21Cip1, p27Kip1, ATF4, cyclin E, p53, TRIB3, phospho-p53 (Ser6, Ser33, Ser46, Ser392),
phospho-p38 MAPK Thr180/Tyr182, Chk1, Chk2, phospho-ATM S1981, phospho-ATR
S428, and phospho-p90RSK Ser380. CAPE treatment decreased Skp2 and Akt1 protein
expression in LNCaP 104-R1 tumors as compared to control group. Overexpression
of Skp2, or siRNA knockdown of p21Cip1, p27Kip1, or p53 blocked suppressive effect of
CAPE treatment. Co-treatment of CAPE with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Bcl-2 inhibitor
ABT737 showed synergistic suppressive effects. Our finding suggested that CAPE
treatment induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in CRPC cells via regulation
of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1.

INTRODUCTION

prostate tumors recur following androgen deprivation [2,
15, 16].
Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a main
bioactive component extracted from honeybee hive
propolis. CAPE is a well known NF-κB inhibitor at
concentrations of 50 μM to 80 μM by preventing the
translocation of p65 unit of NF-κB and the binding
between NF-κB and DNA [17]. We previously
reported that CAPE dosage dependently suppressed the
proliferation of androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S and
AR-negative PC-3 cells [18, 19]. Administration of CAPE
by gavage significantly inhibited the tumor growth of
LNCaP and PC-3 xenografts in nude mice [18–20]. We
discovered that CAPE treatment inhibited cell growth and
induced G1 cell cycle arrest by suppressing c-Myc and
Akt-related protein signaling networks in LNCaP 104-S
and PC-3 cells [18–20]. However, the protein expression
profile and response to treatment of chemotherapy drugs or
kinase inhibitors was quite different between LNCaP 104R1 and LNCaP 104-S cells [21]. We therefore used LNCaP
104-R1 cells as well as other CRPC cell lines 22Rv1,
DU-145, and LNCaP C4–2 to determine the molecular
mechanisms lying underneath of the anticancer effects
of CAPE on CRPC cells. Micro-Western Array (MWA)
is an antibody-based modified reverse phase array allows
detecting protein expression level or phosphorylation
status change of 96–384 different antibodies in 6–15
samples simultaneously [22]. We used MWA to determine
the changes of signaling protein profile in LNCaP 104R1 cells being treated with CAPE. Our study suggested
that CAPE treatment can efficiently induced G1 or G2/M
cell cycle arrest, cellular and growth inhibition in CRPC
cells via inhibition of Skp2 as well as induction of p21Cip1,
p27Kip1, and p53 in CRPC cell lines. Our finding implied
that CAPE treatment might be a potential therapy for
patients with CRPC.

Prostate cancer is the second most frequently
diagnosed cancer of men and the fifth most common
cancer overall in the world. Incidence of prostate cancer
(PCa) is increasing steadily in almost all countries [1].
According to the statistics of Surveillance Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER) of National Cancer Institute,
more than 240,000 men were diagnosed with and more
than 28,000 men died of cancer of the prostate in 2012 in
United States. While surgery is often successful for organconfined PCa, androgen ablation therapy is the primary
treatment for metastatic PCa. However, most PCa patients
receiving the androgen ablation therapy will ultimately
develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within
1–3 years with a median overall survival time of 1–2
years after relapse [2, 3]. Currently, there is no effective
standard therapy for CRPC. Although chemotherapy is
usually applied for treatment of CRPC [4], these drugs
show little effect on prolonging survival [4]. Undesired
side effects of these chemotherapeutic agents include toxic
deaths, strokes, thrombosis, neutropenia, edema, dyspnea,
malaise, and fatigue [4]. Alternative therapies are therefore
in need for CRPC.
Androgen receptor (AR), an androgen-activated
transcription factor, belongs to the nuclear receptor
superfamily. AR plays essential roles in the development
of male sex organs and prostate tissues, maturation
of bones, and normal female fertility. AR signaling
is important for the development, progression, and
metastasis of PCa [5]. Increase in AR mRNA and
protein was observed in CRPC tumors compared to the
primary prostate tumors [6–11]. LNCaP is a commonly
used cell line established from a human lymph node
metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma [12], which
expresses AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA). We
have established LNCaP sublines mimic the progression
of PCa. An androgen-dependent clonal subline of the
LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line called LNCaP
104-S was subjected to long-term androgen deprivation
in order to model changes which occur in the PCa cells
in patient undergoing androgen-ablation therapy. LNCaP
104-S cells first underwent a G1 cell cycle arrest and
subsequently died [13, 14]. However, a small portion of
the cells survived and re-started to proliferate after about
40 passages (~half year) in androgen-depleted medium.
The surviving LNCaP 104-S cells gave rise to LNCaP 104R1 cells [13, 14]. Proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells is
androgen-independent but is repressed by physiological
concentration of androgens [13, 14]. During the transition
of LNCaP 104-S cells to LNCaP 104-R1, AR mRNA and
protein level increased dramatically. AR transcriptional
activity also increased by 20-fold during the progression
[13, 14]. Our LNCaP prostate cancer progression model
mimics the clinical situations in which AR-positive

RESULTS
CAPE treatment suppressed the proliferation
and survival of castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) cell lines
Treatment of CAPE (dissolved in ethanol) at 10–
40 μM for 96 h significantly reduced the cell number
of AR-rich androgen-independent LNCaP 104-R1 cells
dose-dependently as determined by light microscopy
(Supplementary Figure 1). The ethanol control did not
affect cell number of LNCaP 104-R1 cells as compared
to no treatment (data not shown). Examination using
fluorescent microscopy with Hoechst dye staining and
DAPI staining indicated that cell survival and proliferation
of commonly used CRPC cell lines, including LNCaP 104R1 (Figure 1), AR-positive 22Rv1 (Supplementary Figure
2), AR-negative DU-145 (Supplementary Figure 3), and

Figure 1: CAPE treatment for 96 h reduced cell proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells. DAPI staining and Hoechst dye-

staining of LNCaP 104-R1 cells being treated with increasing concentrations of CAPE for 96 h was used to monitor cell proliferation of
LNCaP 104-R1 cells using fluorescent microscope with magnification of 100X.

AR-positive LNCaP C4–2 cells (Supplementary Figure 4)
were all significantly suppressed by CAPE treatment dosedependently. The suppressive effects of CAPE on survival
of CRPC cells were further confirmed by MTT assay and
Hoechst 33258 96-well proliferation assay. MTT assay
and Hoechst 33258 proliferation assay indicated an IC50
of 16.5 μM and 18.9 μM, respectively, for CAPE to cause
growth inhibition on LNCaP 104-R1 cells (Figure 2A).
The growth inhibitory effect of CAPE was evident
within 24 hours of treatment but the suppressive effect
accumulated over time (Figure 2B). The IC50 of 24, 48,
72, and 96 h CAPE treatment on LNCaP 104-R1 cells was
64.0, 30.5, 20.5, and 18.0 μM, respectively. We compared
the sensitivity of LNCaP 104-R1 cells to CAPE treatment
with the four other CRPC cell lines. CAPE treatment
dosage-dependently suppressed the proliferation of
LNCaP 104-R1, LNCaP C4–2, 22Rv1, PC-3, and DU-145
cells (Figure 2C) with an IC50 of 18.9, 10.9, 19.1, 23.2, and
22.6 μM, respectively. CAPE treatment caused the CRPC
cells to proliferate slower. The doubling time of LNCaP
104-R1, LNCaP C4–2, 22Rv1, and DU-145 is 30.7, 37.4,
37.4, and 36.0 h, respectively. Under the treatment of
10 μM CAPE, the doubling time of these cells increased
to 47.5, 75.8, 106.8, and 40.5 h, respectively. When being
treated with 20 μM CAPE, the doubling time of LNCaP
104-R1 and DU-145 further extended to 68.6 and 44.2
h, respectively. We did not examine the doubling time of
LNCaP C4–2 and 22Rv1 under treatment of 20 μM CAPE,
as they proliferated too slow under this condition. Colony

formation assay revealed that treatment with 10 μM CAPE
reduced colony formation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells by 90%
while treatment with 20 μM CAPE completely blocked the
formation of LNCaP 104-R1 colonies (Figure 2D). These
results confirmed the anti-cancer effect of CAPE against
CRPC cells.

CAPE treatment induced G1 or G2 cell cycle
arrest in CRPC cells
Annexin V staining and TUNEL assay for LNCaP
104-R1, LNCaP C4–2, 22Rv1, and DU-145 cells did
not reveal any increase of apoptotic cells under CAPE
treatment (data not shown). Western blotting analysis
illustrated that protein expression of LC3-II and Beclin
was not altered by CAPE treatment (data not shown),
implying that autophagy probably did not happen in these
CRPC cells. Some of the LNCaP 104-R1 cells treated with
CAPE showed moderate positive β-galactosidase staining
(Supplementary Figure 5). However, the cell morphology
did not enlarge, suggesting that CAPE possibly caused
hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest or quiescence in 104-R1
cells, but not cell senescence (Supplementary Figure 5)
[23–25]. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a reduction
of cells in the S phase and G2/M phase but an increase
of cells in the G1 phase population in LNCaP 104-R1
cells under CAPE treatment (Figure 3A), suggesting that
CAPE caused G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP 104-R1 cells.
On the other hand, CAPE treatment reduced G1 phase

CRPC cells. (A) LNCaP 104-R1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CAPE for 96 h to determine suppressive effect of

CAPE on cell proliferation. Relative cell number was determined by either Hoechst 33258 fluorescence based-96 well proliferation assay
or by MTT assay. Relative cell number was normalized to cell number of control (no treatment). (B) LNCaP 104-R1 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of CAPE for 24, 48, 72, 96 h to investigate the suppressive effects of CAPE. Relative cell number was normalized

(C) LNCaP 104-R1, PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP C4–2, and 22Rv1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CAPE for 96 h to

(Figure 3D) cells, indicating that CAPE caused G2/M cell
cycle arrest in DU-145, C4–2, and 22Rv1 cells.

as compared to the control group (Figure 4B, 4C).
Although there was a trend that CAPE increased p53 and
p27Kip1 but decreased cyclin D1 in tumors, the difference
in protein abundance between control and treatment group
was not statistically significant (Figure 4C).

CAPE treatment retarded the growth of LNCaP
104-R1 xenograft in nude mice

CAPE treatment affected the expression
of proteins regulating cell survival, cell
proliferation, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage
checkpoint, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway

Administration of CAPE by gavage (10 mg/kg
body weight per day) for eight weeks resulted in 50%
reduction of tumor volume (Figure 4A), suggesting that
CAPE treatment retarded the growth of LNCaP 104R1 xenografts. CAPE treatment did not affect the body
weight of the mice (data not shown), which means that the
dosage used was not overtly toxic. CAPE gavage slowed
down the tumor growth of LNCaP 104-R1 cells, which
was consistent with our observation that CAPE treatment
induced cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. Western
blotting assay indicated that CAPE treatment reduced
protein expression of Skp2 and Akt1 in 104-R1 xenografts

As CAPE treatment reduced cell proliferation
and induced cell cycle arrest in CRPC cells, we used
Micro-Western Arrays (MWAs), a high-throughput
Western blotting assay [19, 22, 26], to determine how
proteins regulating cell proliferation, cell survival, and
cell cycle progression are affected by CAPE treatment.
CAPE treatment significantly decreased protein levels

phospho-p70S6kinase Thr421/Ser424, Skp2, p90RSK, and
NF-κB p65. Alternatively, CAPE treatment significantly
increased p53, phospho-p53 Ser392, phospho-p53 Ser33,
phospho-p53 S6, phospho-p53 Ser46, p27Kip1, mTOR,
CK1, GSK3α, CK2α, cyclin A, p38 MAPK, and p21Cip1
(Figure 5A, 5B).
Conventional Western blotting assay was then
used to confirm the changes of protein expression.
CAPE treatment affected proteins regulating cell cycle,
proliferation, survival, DNA damage check point, and
PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Expression of Cdk2,
phospho-Cdk2 Thr160, Cdk4, Cdk7, Skp2, c-Myc, Rb,
phospho-Rb Ser807/811, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin H,
and E2F1 proteins was significantly suppressed by CAPE
treatment (Figure 6A, 6B), while protein abundance
of cyclin E, p27Kip1, p21Cip1, p53, phospho-p53 Ser392,
phospho-p53 Ser33, phospho-p53 S6, phospho-p53 Ser46,
CHK1, CHK2, phospho-ATM Ser1981, phospho-ATR
Ser428, and ATF4 (Figure 6A, 6B) were significantly
induced by CAPE treatment.
The protein abundance of total Akt, Akt1, Akt2, and
phospho-Akt Ser473 was decreased by CAPE treatment
(Figure 7A, 7B). Additionally, CAPE treatment suppressed
the protein expression of PDK1, SGK, phospho-SGK
S255/T256, FAS, p70S6kinase, phospho-p70S6kinase
Thr421/Ser424, mTOR, phospho-mTOR Ser2481, and
phospho-GSK3α Ser21 (Figure 7A, 7B). Conversely,
CAPE treatment increased phospho-CREB Ser133,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phospho-p38 MAPK Thr180/Tyr182, and phosphop90RSK Ser380, Bax, CKIIα, and TRIB3.
Skp2, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p53 are proteins important
in regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression,
while Chk1, Chk2, ATM, and ATR are DNA damage
checkpoint proteins. Expression of these proteins was
significantly affected by CAPE treatment in LNCaP 104R1 cells (Figures 5–7). We therefore examined if CAPE
treatment also affected expression of these proteins in
22Rv1, LNCaP C4–2, and DU-145 cells. Similar to
LNCaP 104-R1 cells, Skp2 protein abundance in 22Rv1,
C4–2, and DU-145 cells was significantly suppressed by
CAPE treatment (Figure 8, Figure 9). On the other hand,
CAPE treatment induced expression of p21Cip1, p27Kip1,
p53, Chk1, Chk2, phospho-ATM Ser1981, and phosphoATR Ser428 in all four CRPC cell lines (Figures 8, 9).
The changes of these proteins may all contribute to the
inhibition of cell growth as well as induction of cell cycle
arrest in CRPC cells.

Overexpression of Skp2 rescued the suppressive
effect of CAPE on cell proliferation of 104-R1
cells
CAPE treatment caused 49%, 55%, and 65%
reduction of Skp2, c-Myc, and total Akt, respectively. To
determine if CAPE suppressed cell proliferation through
suppression of Skp2, c-Myc, or Akt, we overexpressed

Figure 4: CAPE suppressed tumor growth of LNCaP 104-R1 xenografts. (A) LNCaP 104-R1 cells were injected subcutaneously

into athymic mice to form tumors. After 14 weeks, the average tumor volume exceeded 150 mm3. The mice were then separated into control
group and CAPE treatment group. Control group contained 6 mice and 8 tumors, while CAPE treatment group contained 6 mice and 9
tumors. CAPE (10 mg/kg/day in sesame oil) or vehicle (sesame oil) was administered by gavage starting from 14th week after cancer
cell injection and was shown as 1st week for gavage in figure. Tumor volume and body weight of mice carrying 104-R1 xenografts were
measured weekly. Tumor volume was shown as volume plus standard error (SE). Mice body weight in two groups did not show significant
difference. (B) Protein expression of Skp2, p53, Akt1, p27Kip1, cyclin D1, and Rb in LNCaP 104-R1 tumors from control group or CAPE
treatment group was assayed with Western blotting assay. α-tubulin was used as loading control. (C) The average expression level of Skp2,
p53, Akt1, p27Kip1, cyclin D1, and Rb proteins in CAPE-treated LNCaP 104-R1 tumors was compared to those in tumors from control
group. Asterisk* represents statistically significant difference p < 0.05 between the two groups.

Skp2, c-Myc, and Akt1 in LNCaP 104-R1 cells. Akt1
over-expression slightly blocked the anti-proliferative
effect of CAPE (Figure 10A). Surprisingly, c-Myc
over-expression did not show any rescue effect (data
not shown). Overexpression of Skp2 in LNCaP 104R1 cells significantly blocked the suppressive effect of
CAPE treatment (Figure 10B). Flow cytometry analysis
indicated that CAPE treatment induced G1 cell cycle
arrest in control LNCaP 104-R1 cells but not LNCaP
104-R1 cells overexpressing Skp2 (Figure 10C). CAPE
treatment suppressed cyclin D1 and c-Myc in both control
and Skp2 overexpressing LNCaP 104-R1 cells (Figure
10D). However, the accumulation of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1
was 22% and 50% less, respectively, while abundance of
Cdk2 and phospho-Cdk2 Thr160 were either less or not
affected by CAPE in Skp2 overexpressing LNCaP 104-R1
cells as compared to the control LNCaP 104-R1 cells. The
lower endogenous level p27Kip1 in Skp2 overexpressing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LNCaP 104-R1 cells was consistent to the function of
Skp2 as Skp2 target p27Kip1 for degradation. Consequently,
reduction of Skp2, Cdk2, and phospho-Cdk2 Thr160, as
well as accumulation of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 were likely to
play essential roles in the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by
CAPE treatment in LNCaP 104-R1 cells.

Knockdown of p27Kip1, p21Cip1, or p53 rescued the
suppressive effect of CAPE on cell proliferation
of LNCaP 104-R1 cells
Besides Skp2, CAPE treatment induced protein
expression of p27Kip1, p21Cip1, and p53 in all CRPC cell lines.
We therefore determined if siRNA knockdown of p27Kip1,
p21Cip1, or p53 may rescue the growth inhibition of LNCaP
104-R1 cells induced by CAPE treatment. Indeed, siRNA
knockdown of p27Kip1 (Figure 11A), p21Cip1 (Figure 11B), or
p53 (Figure 11C) rescued the cell proliferation of LNCaP

additive suppressive effect on cell growth of LNCaP 104R1 cells. Indeed, combination of 2.5–10 μM CAPE with
1–5 μM LY294002 showed synergetic suppression on
cell growth of LNCaP 104-R1 cells (Figure 12A–12C).
Combination of higher dose of CAPE (20 or 40 μM)
with LY294002 only showed additive but not synergistic
suppressive effects. Expression of Bcl-2 in androgenindependent LNCaP 104-R1 cells is 65-fold higher that in
parental androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S cells at culture
condition [21]. Bcl-2 expression may protect LNCaP 104R1 cells from cell death under stress or drug treatment.
CAPE treatment slightly decreased the protein level of
Bcl-2 (Figure 7). We anticipated that co-treatment with
Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT737 will exhibit additive suppressive
effect. As shown in Figure 12D–12F, combined treatment
of CAPE with ABT737 demonstrated additive suppressive
effect while combination of low dose of ABT737 with
CAPE displayed synergetic suppressive effect.

Co-treatment of CAPE with LY294002 or ABT737
suppressed proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells
Synergistic effect implies the suppressive effect of
two drugs being treated together is greater than the sum
of their separate suppressive effect at the same doses.
Additive suppressive effect indicates that the combination
of two drugs produces an effect that is greater than the
effect of one of the drug. According to the fact that
phosphorylation of Akt was only slightly suppressed by
CAPE treatment and overexpression Akt1 only slightly
rescued the suppressive effect of CAPE treatment in
LNCaP 104-R1 cells, we hypothesized that co-treatment
of CAPE with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 will show

Clinical implication of p53 induction

therefore, administration of CAPE is a possible treatment
for CRPC. CAPE is distributed extensively into animal
tissues and is eliminated rapidly with a short half life [28].
Toxicology study revealed that i.p. injection of 10 mg/
kg of CAPE did not show any toxicity on liver or kidney
in mice study while i.p. injection of higher dose (20 and
30 mg/kg) CAPE caused mild dose-dependent toxicity
on liver and kidney [29]. CAPE treatment has also been
shown to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs and radiation treatment [30]. Therefore, treatment
with CAPE not only may suppress CRPC tumor growth
in patients but may also protect PCa patients from
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
The p53 protein is encoded by the Tp53 gene. The
p53 protein is a main regulator of the cell cycle arrest and
cellular senescence in response to short telomeres, DNA
damage, oncogenes, supraphysiological mitogenic signals,

Analysis of Oncomine database suggested that
PCa tumors expressed less Tp53 as compared to normal
prostate epithelial tissues (Figure 13A, 13B). Since
CAPE treatment significantly increased abundance of
p53 protein, CAPE treatment is thus a potential effective
therapy for PCa.

DISCUSSION
Our observations implied that CAPE treatment
at dosage 10–20 μM can effectively suppressed the
proliferation, survival, soft agar colony formation, and
tumor growth of CRPC cells via induction of G1 or
G2/M cell cycle arrest. The achievable physiological
concentration of CAPE in human serum is 17 μM [27],

and tumor suppressor gene overexpression [31]. The p53
protein is negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin-protein
ligase HDM2, which facilitates its degradation [32].
HDM2 is negatively regulated by the alternate-readingframe protein (ARF) [32]. The p53 protein establishes
the cell cycle arrest in part by inducing the expression
of p21Cip1 [32]. The ATR kinase is a key transducer of
genomic damage induced by oncogenes [33]. Activation
of ATR is sufficient to promote cell cycle arrest and,
if persistent, triggers p53-dependent but p16/ARFindependent senescence [34]. CAPE treatment can alter
redox state and induce DNA damage in cancer cells [35].
ATR is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase which is
the sensor for DNA damage [36–38]. ATR activates the
DNA damage checkpoint, which leads to cell cycle arrest
[33, 37, 38]. Persistent single-stranded DNA activates
ATR [33, 37, 38]. Activated ATR then phosphorylates
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Chk1, initiating a signal transduction cascade that
culminates in cell cycle arrest [33]. ATM (Ataxia
telangiectasia mutated) is a serine/threonine protein
kinase which is recruited and activated by DNA doublestrand breaks. It phosphorylates p53, Chk2, H2AX, and
other tumor suppressors, which initiates the activation of
the DNA damage checkpoint and leads to cell cycle arrest,
DNA repair or apoptosis, [39]. Upon DNA damage, ATM
autophosphorylates on residue Ser1981, stimulating the
dissociation of ATM dimmers and is therefore followed
by the release of active ATM monomers [40]. The ATMmediated DNA damage response consists of both the
rapid and the delayed response. ATM phosphorylates and
activates the effector kinase Chk2 [41, 42]. Activated
Chk2 then phosphorylates phosphatase CDC25A, which is
degraded and is unable to dephosphorylate Cdk2-Cyclin,
resulting in cell-cycle arrest [41, 42]. If the DSB can not

be repaired during this rapid response, ATM with then
phosphorylate MDM2 and p53 at Ser15 [41, 42]. p53 is
also phosphorylated by the effector kinase Chk2 [41, 42].
These phosphorylation finally lead to stabilization and
activation of p53 and subsequent transcription of several
p53 target genes including p21Cip1 and therefore induce
long-term cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis [41, 42]. Chk1 is
a serine/threonine protein kinase and is a key regulator
of genome stability, cell cycle, and cell survival [43].
Chk1 coordinates the DNA damage response [44]. Chk1
is regulated by ATR through phosphorylation. Activation
of Chk1 results in the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints,
cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or even apoptosis [44–46].
Activation of Chk1 holds the cell in the G2 phase until
ready to enter the mitotic phase. Chk1 is also essential for
the cell to enter S or M phase [45, 46]. Chk2, is a protein
kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage and is
involved in cell cycle arrest [47]. Activated Chk2 inhibits
Cdc5c phosphatase, prevents entry into mitosis phase,
stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53, and leads to
G1 cell cycle arrest [48]. CAPE treatment significantly
reduced protein abundance of Skp2 and induced protein
level and phosphorylation of p53, ATM, and ATR, as
well as the abundance of p21Cip1, p27Kip1, Chk1, and Chk2
protein in CRPC cells (Figures 6, 8, 9). These changes
may contribute to the induction of cell cycle arrest in
CRPC cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

As mentioned by Dr. Blagosklonny, cell cycle
arrest is not yet senescence [23, 24]. When the cell
cycle is arrested, an inappropriate growth-stimulation,
such as activation of mTOR, converts the cell cycle
arrest into cellular senescence [23, 24]. Properties of
cellular senescence include a large flat morphology,
SA-β-gal staining, feedback signal resistance, and loss
of regenerative potential [24]. According to the facts that
CRPC cells treated with CAPE did not show enlargement,
and CAPE treatment suppressed mTOR signaling related
proteins (Figure 7), only a portion of cells showed positive
SA-β-gal staining, and some cells still proliferate under
CAPE treatment, we believe that CAPE treatment induced
quiescence cell cycle arrest but not cellular senescence.
Hypoxia can increase content and functions of lysosomal,
which may display as moderate SA-β-Gal-staining in
cells [25]. In some cells, hypoxia can slow down cell
proliferation and cause cell cycle arrest [25]. Under
hypoxic conditions, cells are relatively small, whereas
senescent cells are large and flat [25]. Hypoxia-arrested
cells can resume proliferation when being placed under
normoxia [25]. We therefore believe that CAPE treatment
triggered hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest/quiescence in
LNCaP 104-R1 cells.

inducing the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase
(Cdk) inhibitors p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p57, p130, Tob1, and
FoxO1 [49–51]. Skp2 targets Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 by
phosphorylating p27Kip1 at T187 for ubiquitination and
degradation [52–54]. Both luminal and basal epithelial
cells in normal prostate exhibit very low Skp2 levels,
however, Skp2 levels increase dramatically in both
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PIN) and PCa [49,
55]. Up-regulation of Skp2 correlates to lower p27Kip
expression, higher Gleason score, more advanced
pathological stage, and recurrence in PCa patients
[55–57]. Up-regulation of Skp2 in PCa patient is an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

independent factor for prediction of higher risk of PCa
recurrence after surgery [55, 56]. Skp2 overexpression in
PCa cells stimulates PCa cell proliferation and increases
the tumorigenesis in xenograft tumor model [58]. Tissuespecific over-expression of Skp2 in prostate promotes
proliferation, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and low-grade
carcinoma in the prostate gland [59]. Deficiency of Skp2
in vivo triggers cellular senescence via up-regulation
of p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and ATF4, therefore suppresses the
development of PCa [60]. Skp2 was reported to cross-talk
with PI3K/Akt [61], AR [62], PTEN [55], and BRCA2
[63] signaling pathways in PCa cells. As a result, Skp2

and mild synergistic inhibition on proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells. Proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells treated with

increasing dosage (0, 5, 10, 20 μM) of LY294002 (A), combination of CAPE and LY294002 (B), ABT737 (D), and combination of CAPE
with ABT737 (E) was determined by 96-well proliferation assay. The ration of expected cell number/observed cell number of LNCaP
104-R1 cells treated with combination of CAPE and LY294002 (C) or combination of CAPE and ABT737 (F) was shown. The effect of
the combined treatment was determined by the ratio of expected cell number/observed cell number. For example, treatment of 104-R1
cells with 5 μM of ABT737 decreased the cell number to 69.2% and treatment with 104-R1 cells with 5 μM CAPE alone decreased the
cell number to 75.6%. The expected cell number of treatment combining 5 μM of ABT737 with 5 μM CAPE was 0.692 × 0.756 = 52.3%.
The actual observed cell number is 47.0%. The ratio of expected cell number/observed cell number is 0.523/0.470 = 1.1. Ratio larger
than one represents synergy of growth inhibition as the combined treatment of two drugs suppressed more cells than either drug alone.
If the observed cell number is less than the cell number being treated with any one of the drug alone, this indicates additive suppressive
effect of the combination treatment of the two drugs. For example, treatment of 104-R1 cells with 2.5 μM of LY294002 decreased the cell
number to 91.2%, while treatment with 104-R1 cells with 40 μM CAPE decreased the cell number to 14.5%. The combination of 2.5 μM

plays essential role in the development and progression
of human PCa [49]. Development of compounds targeting
Skp2 may be a useful strategy for the treatment of patients
with CRPC. We discovered that overexpression of Skp2
reduced the accumulation of p21Cip1and p27Kip1 as well
as lessen the decrease of Cdk2 and phospho-Cdk2 T160
caused by CAPE treatment (Figure 10). CAPE treatment
reduced protein expression of Skp2 but induced protein
abundance of p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p53, and ATF4 (Figures 4–6,
8, 9). Changes of these proteins may contribute to the
induction of cell cycle arrest in CRPC cells.
Cyclin A is a member of the cyclin family.
Transcription of cyclin A is tightly regulated and
synchronized with cell cycle progression by the
transcription factor E2F in a negative feedback loop
[64]. Both cyclin A and E2F were suppressed by CAPE
treatment (Figure 6). Cdk2 is a member of the cyclindependent kinase family of serine/threonine protein
kinases [65]. Complex of Cdk2 and cyclin A is required
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to progress through the S phase, while binding between
Cdk2-cyclin E is required for the transition of cells
from G1 to S phase [65]. Activation of Cdk2 complexes
requires phosphorylation of Thr160 on Cdk2 by Cdk7 and
cyclin H [66] as well as dephosphorylation of Thr14 and
Tyr15 on Cdk2 by cdc25 phosphatase. Although CAPE
treatment did not alter phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr
15 on Cdk2, it repressed phosphorylation of Thr160 on
Cdk2 (Figure 6), which will suppress the activity of Cdk2.
Skp2 is phosphorylated by Cdk2 at Ser64 [54] and by
Akt at Ser72 [67]. Phosphorylation of Ser64 and Ser72
on Skp2 regulates the stabilization of Skp2 by preventing
its association with APC/CCdh1 [51, 52, 54, 67]. Protein
abundance and phosphorylation of Cdk2 and Akt were
both declined by CAPE treatment (Figures 6, 7). CAPE
treatment may therefore reduce the stability of Skp2,
resulting in reduction of Skp2 protein abundance. Cdk4
is a serine/threonine protein kinase which is important
for cell cycle G1 phase progression [68]. The activity of

Cdk4 is controlled by CDK inhibitor p16INK4a. Cdk4 is
responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb)
[68]. CAPE treatment suppressed abundance of Cdk4,
Rb, and phosphor-Rb Ser807/811 (Figure 6). Complex
between Cyclin D and Cdk4 or Cdk6 are key player for
G1/S transition in cell cycle progression [69]. Expression
of cyclin D1 was significantly reduced by CAPE
treatment. As a result, CAPE treatment may interfere the
cell cycle progression and induced G1 or G2/M cell cycle
arrest by suppressing the protein abundance and activity
of Skp2, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk7, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin
H, E2F1, and c-Myc as well as by inducing p21Cip1 and
p27Kip1.
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein
is a negative regulator for PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
[70]. PTEN is frequently deleted or mutated in prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and PCa, giving rise
to elevation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
signaling [71, 72]. Up-regulation of PI3K/Akt activity is
associated with poor clinical outcome of PCa [72–78]. Akt
is a serine/threonine protein kinase with three isoforms, the
Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 [79, 80]. Two phosphorylation sites
on Akt, threonine 308 and serine 473, regulate activity of
Akt. Phosphorylation of Thr308 on Akt is activated by
PDK1 [81], while the phosphorylation of serine 473 on
Akt is activated by mTOR kinase, its associated protein
rector, and SIN1/MIP1 [82, 83]. Akt phosphorylation
level correlates with higher Gleason score [84, 85]. CAPE
treatment caused mild but dose-dependent repression
of Akt1, Akt2, as well as phosphorylation of Akt and
PDK1 (Figure 7). This explained why co-treatment of
(PI3K)-Akt inhibitor LY294002 showed synergistic
suppressive effect (Figure 12). The mammalian target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of rapamycin (mTOR) is also a serine/threonine protein
kinase [86, 87]. The mTOR protein is phosphorylated at
Ser2448 via the PI3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway and
autophosphorylated at Ser2481 [88, 89]. CAPE treatment
significantly suppressed the phospho-mTOR Ser2481 and
phospho-p70S6kinase, a downstream signaling protein of
mTOR pathway [90, 91], while caused a relatively mild
suppression on mTOR and phosphor-mTOR Ser2448
(Figure 7). As mTOR and p70 S6 kinase function as ATP
and amino acid homeostasis sensor, regulator protein
synthesis, balance nutrient uptake, and control cell
proliferation [92, 93], their inhibition caused by CAPE
treatment may interfere nutrient balance, protein synthesis,
and diminish cell proliferation in CRPC cells. TRIB3 is a
putative protein kinase and is induced by NF-κB [94, 95].
TRIB3 is a negative regulator of NF-κB and Akt1 [94, 95].
We observed that CAPE treatment significantly increased
protein level of TRIB3, which may contribute to inhibitory
roles of CAPE on NF-κB [17] and Akt1 (Figure 7).
Rb restricts cell cycle progression from the
G1 phase to S phase [96–98]. Rb binds and inhibits
transcription factors of the E2F family, which will result
in G1 cell cycle arrest [96–98]. Phosphorylation of Rb
is performed by cyclin D/Cdk4/Cdk6 and following by
cyclin E/Cdk2. Phosphorylation of Rb blocks its binding
to E2F and therefore allow the cells to progress from G1
phase to the S phase [96–98]. Rb remains phosphorylated
throughout S, G2, and M phases. It is very interesting
that we observed CAPE treated not only reduced the
protein expression of E2F1 and phospho-Rb Ser807/811,
but it also decreased the abundance of Rb. Previously,
researchers observed that chemotherapeutic drug honokiol
treatment induced G1 cell cycle arrest, growth inhibition,

and induction of p21Cip1 and p53 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells
[99]. Honokiol treatment significantly decreased in the
levels of total and phosphorylated Rb, which correlated
with the reduction of E2F1 transcriptional activity [99].
The authors concluded that honokiol treatment decreased
protein levels of Cdk4, cyclin D1, and Rb via induction of
proteasomal degradation [99]. We believe that CAPE also
induced proteasomal degradation of Rb, cyclin D1, and
Cdk4 in CRPC cells similar to honokiol as the response of
CRPC cells to CAPE treatment is very similar to that of
LNCaP cells being treated with honokiol.
Our observation suggested that inhibition of Skp2
and induction p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 was essential for
growth inhibition promoted by CAPE treatment in CRPC

cells. Not only did CAPE treatment suppressed Skp2
protein expression while increased protein abundance of
p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (Figures 8, 9), but overexpression
of Skp2 or siRNA knockdown of p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1
also partially blocked the suppressive effect of CAPE
on CRPC cells (Figures 10, 11). We summarize all the
signaling pathways being affected by CAPE treatment in
CRPC cells in Figure 14.
We noticed that some Micro-Western Array revealed
that CAPE treatment induced protein expression of
Cdk2, cyclin D1, cyclin A, and SGK (Figure 5), while
conventional Western blotting assay indicated that the
abundance of these proteins was reduced by CAPE
treatment (Figures 6, 7). According to our experience,

6699

Cell culture

there are approximately 5–20% inconsistency between
MWA and conventional Western blot. The inconsistency
is usually due to air bubbles affecting the image quality
during protein transfer, weak signaling of certain MWA
results, or cross-reactivity of certain antibodies. In
Figure 10, the signal of Cdk2 was very weak, while the
inconsistent results of SGK, cyclin A, and cyclin D1 may
be affected by cross-reactivity of antibodies. We suggested
that MWA can be used as a high-throughput screening tool
similar to gene microarray while conventional Western
blotting should be used to confirm the results as using RTPCR for gene array confirmation.
The IC50 of CAPE treatment for AR-positive
androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S cells was 0.68 μM
[19]. Compared to the parental LNCaP 104-S cells, 104R1 cells is 28 fold more resistant to CAPE treatment.
Under the culture condition, the protein abundance of
Skp2, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p53, total Akt, Akt1, Akt2, phosphoAkt S473, and phospho-Akt T308 are similar in 104-S and
104-R1 cells [21]. However, the protein level of Bcl-2 in
104-R1 cells is 65 fold higher than that in 104-S cells [21],
and CAPE treatment caused very little inhibition on Bcl-2
level (Figure 12). Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic oncoprotein.
Normal human prostate epithelial cells do not express the
bcl-2 protein [100]. Up-regulation of Bcl-2 is necessary
for the progression of LNCaP prostate cancer cells from an
androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent growth
stage [100, 101]. It is therefore very possible that high
expression level of Bcl-2 proteins allows 104-R1 cells
to be more resistant to CAPE treatment as compared to
104-S cells. In support of this hypothesis, co-treatment of
Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT737 with CAPE showed synergistic
suppressive effect (Figure 12), providing the rationale of
using CAPE in combination with Bcl-2 for treatment of
patients with CRPC.
We found that Tp53 gene level is lower in prostate
tumors as compared to normal prostate epithelial tissue
from Oncomine database analysis (Figure 13). Since
CAPE treatment significantly increased abundance of
p53 protein in CRPC cell lines, CAPE treatment may thus
benefit patients with advanced prostate cancers.

LNCaP 104-R1 cells were derived from parental
androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S cells, which were

were purchased from Bioresource Collection and Research
Center (Hsinchu city, Taiwan). PC-3, LNCaP C4–2,

CRPC cells were seeded in 8 well chamber slide at
a concentration of 1 × 104 per well and was allowed to

concentration of CAPE 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μM for 96
h. After 96 h, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed
with 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Cells were then
rinsed with PBS three times, each time for 5 min. After
the rinsing, the fixed cells were Incubated in blocking
buffer (5% BSA + 0.1% triton x-100 in PBS) overnight
under at 4°C. After the blocking, cells were rinsed with
PBS for three times, each time for 5 min. Finally, cells
were stained with diluted 1:4000 Hoechst (stock solution
10 mg/mL) or DAPI (5 mg/mL) for 15 min and should be
kept away from light exposure. Cells were then mounted
into the slide and microscope images were captured at
magnification of 100X.

Cell proliferation assay
LNCaP 104-R1 cells, PC-3, LNCaP C4–2, 22Rv1,
and DU-145 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 103

containing 10% CS-FBS with increasing concentration of
CAPE. Relative cell number was analyzed by measuring
the DNA content of cell lysates with the fluorescent dye
Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described
previously [18, 19, 26, 62]. All readouts were normalized

concentrations of CAPE for 96 h. Cell viability was
assessed by an MTT (3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2–5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay [103]. The amount of
formazan was determined by measuring the absorbance
at 560 nm using an Tecan GENios™ plate reader (Tecan
group Ltd, Männedorf, Switzerland) [103]. All results
were normalized to the average of the control condition in
each individual experiment. All experiments were repeated
three times. Each time ten wells were utilized for each
condition. The mean and standard deviation represented
the results from all 30 wells in the three experiments.

Soft agar colony formation assay
We suspended 8,000 LNCaP 104-R1 cells in 0.3%
low melting agarose (Lonza) with 10% CS-FBS in DMEM
medium and then layered on top of 3 ml of 0.5% low
melting agarose plus 10% CS-FBS in DMEM medium
in 6 cm dishes. Cells were allowed to grow at 37°C with
5% CO2 for 14 days. The plates were stained with 0.005%
crystal violet in 30% ethanol for 6 h.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)
Cell RNA was extracted from LNCaP 104-R1 cells
treated with ethanol (control), 10 μM, 20 μM or 40 μM
CAPE for 48 h by RNeasy Mini kit. Cell pellet was lysed
by Buffer RLT. The mRNA expression of Akt1, Akt2,
cyclin D, c-Myc and Skp2 p45 were assayed using SYBR
Green real-time PCR arrays. GAPDH was assayed as RNA
content loading control in each array. The transcript level
of selected genes was analyzed using the RT2 Profiler PCR
Array Data Analysis website (http://www.sabiosciences.
com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php) and normalized to GAPDH
levels [26].

Flow cytometric analysis
After 96 h of culture in the presence of different
concentrations of CAPE, cells were processed as
previously described [21, 26, 62]. Cell cycle profiles of
LNCaP 104-R1, DU-145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP C4–2 cells
were determined by flow cytometric analysis using a BD
Facscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Data was analyzed using ModFit LT software (Verity
Software House, Topsham, ME) as described [21, 26, 62].

Micro-western arrays
LNCaP 104-R1 cells were treated with 0, 10, 20,
or 40 μM CAPE for 96 h. Three biological replicates
of cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (240 mM Trisacetate, 1% SDS, 1% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0) with
DTT, protease inhibitors, and a cocktail of phosphatase
inhibitors. Micro-Western Arrays were performed to
measure protein expression and phosphorylation status
modification as previously described [22, 104]: Gel
fabrication. Glass casting plates (one measuring 14 × 27
cm, the other measuring 14 × 28 cm) were sprayed with
BlueSlick (Serva) and wiped thoroughly. Rubber spacers
were placed on three sides of the inner coated sides of the
glass plate. One rectangle of Netfix (Serva) was placed
on the glass plate on top of the spacers. The second glass
plate was placed on top with the coated surface facing
down. Twelve clamps were placed around the three
gasketed edges of the sandwich. Gel reagents: For 10%
acrylamide gel, we gently mixed 6 ml of 5× gel buffer
(1.2 M Tris-Acetate, adjust pH of Tris-base (Sigma) with
acetic acid (Fisher) to 6.9), 10 ml acrylamide (Ultrapure)
3.8% crosslinker (Fisher), 7.5 ml ddH2O, 6 ml Neat
glycerol, 300 μl 10% w/v SDS, 150 μl 10% APS, and 12
μl Ultrapure TEMED (Invitrogen). This is enough for 2
gels. A 30 ml syringe with a 19 gauge needle was used to

inject the gel mixtures. The sandwich was laid horizontally
for an hour. The gel was then removed from the bottom
glass plate. Microarraying: The lysates were spotted using
a noncontact microarrayer (GeSiM Nanoplotter 2.1E) with
active humidification. Z-height measurements were taken
before the print of each gel. The printing performance of
each tip was validated with a stroboscope before beginning
each microarray print. If printing was inconsistent, 200 μl
of 50% methanol–50% HCl was loaded into the tip and
dispensed three times using manual mode. The tips were
washed for 60 s using the wash/dry cycle and rechecked
with the stroboscope. MWAs were printed onto either one
or two gels per array run. Tip dispense height was held
at 1.5 mm above the gel surface while printing. Samples
were placed with the ladder in well A1 of a 384 well plate
and samples consecutively in A2–A7. Software NP2.15.46
was used. The TransferTipMultiSim04H9 (GeSiM) was
run using the transfer text and the workplate definition
file provided in Supplementary Note 3 as reported
previously [22, 104]. Odyssey protein ladder (LI-COR)
was printed in lane 1 at a 1:2 dilution in lysis buffer. After
print completion, the gel was subsequently rehydrated
for 5 min in the rehydration buffer described above with
gentle agitation. After rehydration, the gel was placed
onto the multiphor (GE Healthcare) for horizontal dry
electrophoresis. Horizontal dry electrophoresis: Samples
were separated by size using a multiphor (GE Healthcare).
The power supply was set at 350 V, 30 W and unlimited
amps. The lowest-molecular-weight ladder bands migrated
about 9 mm (the length of one well of a 96-well plate)
in 12 min. Transfer: After electrophoresis, the gel was
placed protein side down onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad)
premoistened in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 0.2 M
glycine (Fisher), 20% methanol (Sigma), pH 8.5). Filter
paper was placed on either side of the nitrocellulose and
gel, and was clamped in a transfer box cartridge. Bubbles
were pressed out with a roller. The gels were transferred
either at 0.8 A for 60 min or 0.15 A overnight at 4°C in
a Criterion transfer box (Bio-Rad) with plate electrode.
Blotting: Nitrocellulose was removed from the transfer
apparatus and washed for 5 min in TBS (without Tween
20) to remove methanol. The blots were blocked for 1
h in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR). The blot was
aligned on the gasket by placing the visible ladder on
the vertical lines and centering the ladder between the
horizontal lines. The gasket was clamped into the 96-well
isolation device, and primary antibodies were pipetted
into the appropriate wells, making sure that the membrane
remained wet during the process. The primary antibody
was diluted in pure Odyssey blocking buffer (without
Tween 20) overnight. We added 150 μl of diluted antibody
per well. After incubation, the wells were washed four
times with 200 μl of TBST per well using a multichannel
pipettor. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 680–conjugated
secondary (Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit and goat antimouse IR800-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(LI-COR) were diluted in 20% Odyssey blocking buffer,
80% TBS (without Tween 20). We added 150 μl of the
diluted secondary antibody to the appropriate well. After
incubation for an hour, the blot was washed three times
with 200 μl TBST while clamped in the gasketing device
(Arrayit). The blot was then removed from the gasket,
placed in a box top and washed for an additional 5 min
in TBST. For the fifth wash, TBS without Tween 20 was
used, washing for 5 min. The membrane was completely
dried using pressurized air and scanned using the LI-COR
Odyssey imager at 24 μm resolution and high quality
(using laser intensity 1.0 on the 700 nm channel, and using
laser intensity 2.0 on the 800 channel) settings. Analysis:
Scanned images were saved for analysis as 16-bit tiff
files. Genepix 8.0 (Molecular Devices) was used to record
the mean by drawing an equally sized circle around the
appropriately sized band for each sample. Appropriate size
was defined as within 10 kDa of the size as defined by the
antibody product sheet as measured in comparison to the
LI-COR ladder bands. All bands within this region that
were visible were recorded. Bands outside this region were
noted but the intensities were not recorded or analyzed.
The background fluorescence was recorded by placing
an equal sized circle in the blank space to the left of the
first sample (not covering sample or ladder space) and the
minimum value of this circle was recorded. Net intensity
was calculated by subtracting each sample intensity from
the background. To normalize sample concentration, the
net intensities were divided by a simple mean of the net
intensities for GAPDH, α-tubulin and β-actin calculated
separately for each array print. Fold change was calculated
as the ratio of each normalized net intensity to the net
intensity at the 0 min time point, minus one.

Protein overexpression
Ectopic expression of Akt1 and c-Myc was achieved
by infecting LNCaP 104-R1 cells with pSRα or pBabe
retroviruses carrying the cDNA of the indicated proteins,
respectively. Antibiotic-resistant (G418 and puromycin)
colonies were expanded and screened for increased
target protein expression by western blot analysis. For
Skp2 overexpression, LNCaP 104-R1 cells were infected
with pMV7 retrovirus containing Skp2 inserts that
was generated in ΦNX-Ampho packaging cells using
procedures described previously [14]. The ΦNX-Ampho
packaging cell line was provided by Garry Nolan of
Stanford University. Stably infected cells were selected
by G418. Cells infected with retrovirus carrying empty
vectors were used as controls.

siRNA knockdown of p53, p27Kip1 and p21Cip1
Human p53, p27Kip1, p21Cip1 antisense and randomly
scrambled sequence control were purchased from GE
Healthcare (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The
6702

Oncotarget

transfection procedure was performed using lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) according
to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. 40 nM RNA
were used for scramble, p53, p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 knockdown.

treatment was determined by the ratio of expected cell
number/observed cell number. For example, treatment
of 104-R1 cells with 5 μM of ABT737 decreased the
cell number to 69.2% and treatment with 104-R1 cells
with 5 μM CAPE alone decreased the cell number to
75.6%. The expected cell number of treatment combining
5 μM of ABT737 with 5 μM CAPE was 0.692 × 0.756
= 52.3%. The actual observed cell number is 47.0%.
The ratio of expected cell number/observed cell number
is 0.523/0.470 = 1.1. Ratio larger than one represents
synergy of growth inhibition as the combined treatment
of two drugs suppressed more cells than either drug alone.
If the observed cell number is less than the cell number
being treated with any one of the drug alone, this indicates
additive suppressive effect of the combination treatment of
the two drugs. For example, treatment of 104-R1 cells with
2.5 μM of LY294002 decreased the cell number to 91.2%,
while treatment with 104-R1 cells with 40 μM CAPE
decreased the cell number to 14.5%. The combination of
2.5 μM of LY294002 with 40 μM CAPE decreased the cell
number to 13.1%, then we called the combination of 2.5
μM of LY294002 with 40 μM CAPE exhibited additive
suppressive effects on LNCaP 104-R1 cells.

Cellular senescence assay
5 × 104 LNCaP 104R1 cells were seeded in each
well of 6-well plate with DMEM containing 10%
CS-FBS. 24 h after plating, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of CAPE. After an additional 96 h, cells
were washed with PBS and added 1 mL of Fixing Solution
per well (Millpore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). Following 15
min room temperature incubation, the cells were washed
twice with PBS and added 2 mL of senescence-associated
betagalactosidase (SA-β-gal) Detection Solution. After
incubating at 37°C without CO2 overnight, the cells were
washed twice with PBS and photo image of the cells were
taken with phase contrast microscopy or light microscopy.

Xenografts in athymic mice
Experiments involving mice were approved by
National Health Research Institutes Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (NHRI-IACUC-101115-A).
The study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
Male Balb/c nu/nu mice purchased from National
Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei city, Taiwan) at age 6–8
weeks of age were injected subcutaneously in both flanks
with 5 × 105 LNCaP 104-R1 cells suspended in 0.5 ml of
Matrigel (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and
were injected subcutaneously into athymic mice to form
tumors. After 14 weeks, the average tumor volume exceeded
150 mm3. The mice were then separated into control group
and CAPE treatment group. Control group contained 6
mice and 8 tumors, while CAPE treatment group contained
6 mice and 9 tumors. CAPE (10 mg/kg/day in sesame oil)
or vehicle (sesame oil) was administered by gavage starting
from 14th week after cancer cell injection. Tumor volume
and body weight of mice carrying 104-R1 xenografts was
measured weekly using calipers and volume was calculated
using the formula volume = length × width × height × 0.52
[62, 105–107]. Tumor samples for Western blotting assay
analysis were prepared from tissue homogenized in 2×
Laemmli buffer as previously described [14, 106].

Public domain data
Expression profile of Tp53 gene from Singh
prostate datasets was detected by reporter probe 1974_s_
at with Human Genome U95A-Av2 Array [108], which
contains 50 normal prostate gland samples and 52
prostate carcinoma samples. Expression profile of Tp53
gene from Tomlins prostate datasets was detected by
reporter probe IMAGE:24415 [109], which contains 21
normal prostate gland epithelial samples, 4 BPH (benign
prostatic hyperplasia), 12 PIN (prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia), and 30 prostate carcinoma samples. Data were
downloaded from Oncomine (http://www.oncomine.com)
without further processing.

Data analysis
Data are presented as the mean +/– SD of at least
three experiments or are representative of experiments
repeated at least three times. Student’s t-test (two-tailed,
unpaired) was used to evaluate the statistical significance
of results from the proliferation assay experiments.
A Microsoft Excel add-in program ED50V10 was used for
calculating half maximal effective concentration (EC50).

Combined treatment of CAPE with PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 or BCl-2 inhibitor ABT737

CONCLUSION

Proliferation of LNCaP 104-R1 cells treated with
combination of CAPE with LY294002 or CAPE with
ABT737 was determined by 96-well proliferation assay.
The relative cell number under combined treatment
was compared to that being treated with only CAPE,
LY294002, or ABT737 alone. The effect of the combined
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our finding suggested that treatment with CAPE
caused cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in CRPC cells
both in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of Skp2 and induction
p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. We believe that CAPE treatment may
be a novel and useful therapy for patient with CRPC.
