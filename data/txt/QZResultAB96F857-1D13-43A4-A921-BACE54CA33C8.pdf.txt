Abstract
Cancer stem cells are implicated in tumor progression, metastasis, and recurrence, although the exact
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the expression of cellular prion protein (PrPc,
PRNP) is positively correlated with an increased risk of metastasis in colorectal cancer. PrPc deﬁnes a
subpopulation of CD44-positive cancer stem cells that contributes to metastatic capacity. PrPcþCD44þ
colorectal cancer stem cells displayed high liver metastatic capability, unlike PrPcCD44þ stem cells, that
was inhibited by RNAi-mediated attenuation of PrPc. Notably, administration of PrPc monoclonal antibodies
signiﬁcantly inhibited tumorigenicity and metastasis of colorectal cancer stem cells in mouse models of
orthotopic metastasis. PrPc promoted epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the ERK2 (MAPK1)
pathway, thereby conferring high metastatic capacity. Our ﬁndings reveal the function of PrPc in regulating
EMT in cancer stem cells, and they identify PrPc as candidate therapeutic target in metastatic colorectal
cancer. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2682–94. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer is a major cause of mortality, and most human
cancer-related deaths are related to metastasis (1, 2). The
difﬁculty in diagnosing and therapeutically eliminating
metastasis is related to our limited understanding of the
molecules speciﬁcally expressed on the surface of metastatic
cancer cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that a subset
of cancer cells, operationally termed cancer stem cells (CSC)
or tumor-initiating cells, possesses enhanced ability to
regenerate tumors and survive anticancer therapies (3).
CSCs were ﬁrst identiﬁed in the hematopoietic system (4),

and have now been reported in most human solid tumors on
the basis of their functional properties (5–7). Colorectal
CSCs (CCSC) have been distinguished using CD44 or CD133
either alone (8–10), or combined with other markers, such as
EpCAM, CD166, CD29, CD24, LGR5 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1; refs. 11–13). Previous studies by ourselves
and other authors have shown that as few as 100 CD44þ
cancer cells isolated from patients were able to develop into
a heterogeneous tumor, and that spheroids derived from a
single CD44þ cancer cell could recapitulate the heterogeneous hierarchy of tumor cells (8, 14). These studies indicate
that CCSCs may trigger the formation of colorectal cancer
(CRC), and that CD44 is a functionally important surface
biomarker of CCSCs. Importantly, an antibody speciﬁc to
CD44 selectively eradicated leukemic stem cells in vivo by
altering the fate of leukemic stem cells (15). Monoclonal
antibodies targeting surface antigens speciﬁcally expressed
in CSCs offer a potentially powerful strategy to eliminate
CSCs with minimal toxicity. Besides CD44, monoclonal
antibodies targeting CD123 and CD47 have been reported
to eradicate leukemia stem cells (16).
Recent evidence suggests that CSCs may be endowed
with enhanced disseminating capacity enabling them to
invade neighboring tissues or metastasize to distant organs
(17–19). Although CD44 and some other adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin, could act as migration suppressors by restricting cancer cells to their primary sites (20),
these same molecules with certain modiﬁcations (e.g.,
splice variants of CD44) or in combination with other
adhesion molecules, such as CD26, may result in metastatic
phenotypes (21–24).

PrPcþ Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells

Cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a highly conserved glycoprotein present in all vertebrates and has the same protein
sequence as the scrapie prion protein (PrPsc), a pathogenic
factor in scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and kuru in human beings (25, 26). In addition
to the central involvement of PrPc in prion diseases, several
lines of evidence have intriguingly implicated PrPc in human
tumors including glioblastoma, breast, prostate, gastric and
colorectal cancers (CRC; 27). PrPc interacts homophilically
with itself or heterotypically with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as laminin and vitronectin, to
mediate cell adhesion (28). PrPc expression is required for
the self-renewal of CD34þ hematopoietic stem cells (29, 30).
However, despite tantalizing evidence linking PrPc to
human cancers, its physiologic function and exact role in
cancer development remain elusive. Here, we report that
high levels of PrPc expression (in PrPcþ cells) identify a
functionally distinct subpopulation of CD44þ CCSCs, which
contributes to CRC initiation and metastasis. Our ﬁndings
thus reveal hitherto-unknown roles of PrPc in CCSCs and
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suggest that
PrPc could provide a potential therapeutic target in metastatic CRCs.

Materials and Methods
Cells, animals, and samples
Fresh colon samples from patients with CRC and paired
normal subjects were collected from the tumor bank of
Beijing Cancer Hospital (Beijing, China), as approved by the
Research Ethics Board at the Beijing Institute for Cancer
Research. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed as
described previously (31, 32). The NCI-60 human tumor cell
line panel was kindly provided by Dr. Jacque Grassi (National
Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). SW480 and MDA-MB-231
cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection, authenticated using polyphasic (genotypic and
phenotypic) testing every 6 months, and cultured according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Human primary CRC
cells were isolated from patients and cultured in with
serum-free medium. All CCSCs were subcultured for fewer
than 20 passages. Four-week-old female nude mice (BALB/cnu/nu) and 5-week-old female Nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice were purchased from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing,
China), and all experiments were conducted under standard
conditions in accordance with the National and Institutional
regulations.
Tumorigenesis and metastasis in orthotopic xenograft
models
NOD/SCID mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and
the cecums were exteriorized by laparotomy. Various numbers
of CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þPrPc, CD44PrPcþ, and CD44PrPc
subpopulations freshly sorted from patients, or 50,000 DsRedlabeled PrPc overexpressing or knockdown CCSCs were
injected into the cecal wall. All the animals were monitored
for up to 80 to 100 days or until tumor-associated death
occurred. Primary tumors and metastasis were evaluated by

www.aacrjournals.org

a whole-body ﬂuorescence imaging system (In-Vivo FX PRO,
Carestream).

Results
The PrPc expression level is correlated with clinical and
pathologic features and outcomes in CRC patients
On the basis of our previous observations that CD44 is a
robust marker for CCSCs (14), we hypothesized that additional
factors may exist that are coexpressed with CD44 in the
promotion of migration and metastasis of CSCs. We therefore
compared gene expression in colorectal cancer, liver metastases, and normal tissues by cDNA array conducted in our lab.
In addition, we conducted a CD44 coexpression analysis from
Oncomine datasets (Ki_Colon, Koinuma_Colon, and Smith_
Colorectal_2 datasets; refs., 33–35). Interestingly, we found
that several genes were in fact coexpressed with CD44 and
upregulated in metastases; one of these genes was PRNP (data
not shown), which encodes PrPc.
To ﬁnd out whether PrPc and CD44 are associated with the
clinical and pathologic features, we carried out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in a TMA containing 309 colorectal
tumor specimens. CD44 and PrPc were found to be coexpressed in most of the tumors, especially in those that were
poorly differentiated (correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.73; Fig. 1A).
The PrPc expression level was signiﬁcantly higher in poorly
differentiated than in moderately and well-differentiated samples (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A), whereas
the level of CD44 was not associated with clinical stage (P ¼
0.143; Fig. 1A). This observation was supported by examining
multiple Oncomine cDNA microarray datasets, which revealed
that the PRNP mRNA expression levels were signiﬁcantly
elevated in high-grade and advanced-stage CRCs (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Importantly, the patients with CRC with the
highest PrPc expression were also found to have the poorest
prognosis, with a median survival of only 12 months (Fig. 1B),
which was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.0001) shorter than that of
patients whose primary tumor was PrPc-negative (median
survival >5 years).
CRC-related death is usually attributable to recurrence
and distant metastasis. Out of 309 specimens, there were 228
primary CRCs without metastasis versus 81 cases with
concurrent distant metastasis. Strikingly, we found that PrPc
was highly expressed in the primary tumors of the patients
with liver or lung metastasis (P ¼ 0.0007; Fig. 1C). Oncomine
cDNA microarray data analysis also showed a close correlation of the PrPc level with disease recurrence and early
patient death (Supplementary Fig. S1C). We also observed
that PrPc expression was most prominent at the interface
and invasion fronts of tumor nodules (identiﬁed by cytokeratin 20 staining; Fig. 1D), which may constitute a reservoir of
mobile CSCs (36). In the lymph nodes that had been invaded
by CRC cells, PrPcþ cells were also observed in vascular
invasions (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1D). In addition,
high levels of PrPc were present in CRC cells and could be
seen invading the tumor stroma (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these
data indicate that high PrPc expression is associated with
advanced clinical stages, increased metastatic risk, and
reduced patient survival.

NOTE: Indicated numbers (500, 2,000 and 10,000) of CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þPrPc, CD44PrPcþ, and CD44PrPc subpopulations
freshly isolated from CD45EpCAMþ CRC cells in 7 patients (i.e., case 24–30, Supplementary Table S1) were transplanted into cecal
wall of NOD/SCID mice. In 6 of 7 cases, xenograft tumors were regenerated (day 100). The incidence of tumor regeneration at the cecum
and the incidence of metastasis to the liver are shown.

cells in the CD45EpCAMþCD44þ population in patient tumors
(Fig. 2B), and the abundance of CD44þPrPcþ cells ranged from
0.02% to 10.83% (median 0.28%; Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Table S1). Interestingly, the subpopulation of CD44þPrPcþ cells
in the 6 patients with concomitant liver metastasis was significantly higher than that in the 25 primary CRC patients without
metastasis (3.19% vs. 0.79%, mean, P ¼ 0.03; Supplementary
Table S1). Furthermore, PrPc and CD44 were closely associated
in the NCI-60 human tumor cell line panel (correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.68; Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C).
We next asked whether PrPc is associated with CD44 in
contributing to CSC properties. The abilities to form anchorage-independent spheres/spheroids in vitro and to regenerate
serially transplantable xenograft tumors in immunodeﬁcient
mice are 2 of the hallmarks of CSCs (37). We therefore used
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify 4 subpopulations: CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þPrPc, CD44PrPcþ, and
CD44PrPc from patient tumors (Fig. 2B). The purity of each
subpopulation was more than 97%, as assessed by post-sort
FACS and ﬂuorescence microscopic analyses (data not shown).
As expected, CD44þPrPcþ CRC cells displayed signiﬁcantly
greater ability to form colonies compared with CD44þPrPc or
CD44PrPcþ cells (P ¼ 0.02 and P ¼ 0.007, respectively), whereas
CD44PrPc cancer cells failed to generate colonies (Fig. 2D).
To evaluate their tumorigenic potential, the CD44þPrPcþ,
CD44þPrPc, CD44PrPcþ, and CD44PrPc subpopulations
isolated from 9 patients (i.e., cases 22–30 and Supplementary
Table S1) were subcutaneously injected intoNOD/SCID mice.
As predicted by their clonogenicity data, xenograft tumors

2686

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

were generated from the CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þPrPc, and
CD44PrPcþ cells, but not from the CD44PrPc cells in 6 of
9 cases (Supplementary Table S2). In limited-dilution assays,
the CD44þPrPcþ cells displayed greater tumor-initiating
capacity than the other subpopulations (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Table S2). We frequently observed that tumor cells
had invaded the underlying muscle tissue in tumors regenerated from CD44þPrPcþ (but not in those regenerated from
CD44þPrPc) cells (Fig. 2E). To further test their self-renewal
capabilities in vivo, 100 CD44þPrPcþ cancer cells puriﬁed from
a ﬁrst-generation xenograft tumor were transplanted into
NOD/SCID mice. Our ﬁndings indicated that 8 of 9 transplantations grew secondary xenograft tumors that recapitulated
the phenotype of the original tumor, and even higher tumorigenic capacities were detected in the third transplantation
(Supplementary Fig. S2D and data not shown).
Similar tumor-initiating capacities were also observed in
nude mice. We isolated the 4 subpopulations prepuriﬁed from
CD45 tumor cells, and injected them subcutaneously into
nude mice (cases 1–11, Supplementary Table S1). Tumor
development was observed in 8 cases (Supplementary Fig.
S2E). Again, the CD44þPrPcþ CRC cells exhibited the greatest
tumor-initiating capacity (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S2).
As shown in Supplementary Figure S2E, the reconstituted
tumors were histologically heterogeneous. PrPc and CD44
coexpression was detected in only a minor subset of cells
in regenerated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2F–S2G), also
suggesting that the CD44þPrPcþ cells were capable of selfrenewal.

PrPcþ Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells

As in leukemic stem cells (15), knocking down CD44 in CRC
cells signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor regeneration (14). To investigate the role of PrPc in tumor initiation, we isolated primary
CRC cells from patients and cultured them in ultra-low attachment dishes without serum. Remarkably, PrPc knockdown in
the CRC cells also retarded tumor growth in nude mice,
although the inhibitory effect was slightly less apparent than
with CD44 knockdown (Fig. 2F). However, combined knockdown of both CD44 and PrPc completely abolished tumor
development (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data suggest that
the CD44þPrPcþ subpopulation of CRC cells does possess CSC
properties.
PrPcþ CSC is more metastatic
Because PrPc is highly expressed in metastatic tissues, we
attempted to ﬁnd out whether it contributes to metastasis
in CRC. To recapitulate human cancers with greater ﬁdelity,
we transplanted 500, 2,000 and 10,000 cells from each of the
CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þPrPc, CD44PrPcþ and CD44PrPc
subpopulations isolated from 7 patients (i.e., case 24–30,
Supplementary Table S1), into the cecal wall of NOD/SCID
mice (38). As shown in Table 1, 6 of the 7 patient-derived
CRC cells produced cecal tumors, which was consistent
with the results obtained from subcutaneously-implanted
tumor cells (Supplementary Table S2). The CD44þPrPcþ
cells clearly formed tumors with the greatest efﬁciency
(P < 0.01; Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Remarkably,
macroscopic and microscopic analysis revealed that liver
metastases were almost exclusively observed in the mice
implanted with PrPcþ cells (i.e., CD44þPrPcþ and CD44
PrPcþ; Fig. 3A–C; Table 1). Furthermore, semiquantitative
measurement of the metastatic area and the metastatic index
conﬁrmed that the tumors derived from PrPcþ CRC cells were
highly metastatic (Fig. 3D–E).
The spleen transplantation model is another commonly
used approach to test the proliferative and metastatic potential
of CSCs (39, 40). CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þPrPc, CD44PrPcþ, and
CD44PrPc subpopulations were sorted from the tumors of
10 patients (i.e., cases 12–21, Supplementary Table S1), and 500
cells from each subpopulation were then transplanted into the
spleen of nude mice. Similar to the results obtained using the
orthotopic model, liver metastasis occurred within 70 days in
28 of 30 cases of CD44þPrPcþ, 3 of 30 cases of CD44þPrPc, 15
of 30 cases of CD44PrPcþ, and 2 of 30 cases of CD44PrPc
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3B). These results suggest that
PrPcþ is intimately associated with the CRC liver metastasis.
Transwell analysis showed that CD44þPrPcþ cells displayed
about 16-fold greater migratory ability than CD44þPrPc cells
(Fig. 3F). Most of the migrating cells (84.25  3.14%) were found
to be PrPc-positive, versus only 1.25  0.22% of the nonmigrant

cells (Fig. 3G). Collectively, these observations imply that PrPc
is crucial for CCSC migration in vitro and for metastasis in vivo.
PrPc is functionally important for cell migration and
cancer metastasis
Because CSC is generally rare and it is difﬁcult to label and
trace its growth in animals, we generated a cell line of CD44þ
CCSCs isolated from a CRC patient. These cells have all the
characteristics of CSCs including constitutive expression of
CD44, and the capacity to form spheres and generate xenograft
tumors (14). The CCSCs were grown in ultra-low attachment
dishes without serum, and were subcultured once a week for
fewer than 20 passages. To investigate the unique role of PrPc
in metastasis, we used this cell line prelabeled with DsRed and
in which PrPc had either been knocked down by shRNAs or was
overexpressed via the pBABE-PURO retrovirus system. As
shown in Fig. 4A–C, PrPc knockdown strongly inhibited tumor
growth and liver metastasis as assessed by whole-body ﬂuorescence imaging and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining,
suggesting that PrPc play a central role in CSC metastasis. In
contrast, both tumor growth and liver metastasis were promoted by PrPc overexpression. Moreover, the level of PrPc
expression was correlated with the metastatic index (Fig. 4D).
Similar results were observed using the spleen metastasis
model (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). In addition, Transwell
migration assays revealed that the levels of PrPc correlated
with the migratory capacity of CCSCs (Fig. 4E). It is noteworthy
that the PrPc levels did not alter the cell-cycle proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Using CRC cells with CSC properties, we
were able to show that PrPc is functionally required for the
migration of CCSCs and contributes to CRC metastasis.

PrPc antibodies inhibit migration and metastasis
Surface markers unique to CSCs would provide ideal therapeutic targets on these cells, and indeed monoclonal antibodies have shown therapeutic efﬁcacy in both preclinical
tumor models and patients with cancer (41). We were therefore
interested in addressing the question of whether PrPc could be
used as a therapeutic target, in a manner similar to CD44 (15).
We generated several monoclonal antibodies against PrPc, out
of which we selected the IgG1 antibody. The speciﬁcity of the
antibodies was veriﬁed by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and
IHC staining (Supplementary Fig. S4E–S4G). The migration of
CD44þ CCSCs in vitro was strongly inhibited after they had
been treated with 1 mg/mL anti-PrPc antibodies. The inhibitory
effect obtained was greater than that associated with the antiCD44 antibody (1.7 fold). A combination of 1 mg/mL antiCD44 and 1 mg/mL anti-PrPc antibodies was able to inhibit
migration by up to approximately 80% (Fig. 4F); whereas PrPc

antibodies did not show any effect on cell migration in PrPc
knockdown cells (data not shown).
It was essential to ﬁnd out whether PrPc monoclonal antibodies can prevent CRC metastases in vivo. NOD/SCID mice
bearing orthotopic implantations of CCSCs were administered
200 mg antibodies intraperitoneally on a weekly basis. ELISA
analysis revealed that the concentration of anti-PrPc antibody
in the serum of tumor-bearing animals was maintained at 0.87
to 1 mg/mL (data not shown). The orthotopic and metastatic
tumors were monitored by whole-body ﬂuorescence imaging
every week and after 8 to 10 weeks the mice were sacriﬁced and
underwent pathology examinations. The presence of anti-PrPc
antibodies dramatically decreased tumorigenicity and liver
metastases (Fig. 4G), whereas their bodyweight did not
decrease (not shown). CCSCs precoated with anti-PrPc antibodies before orthotopic implantation produced a similar
inhibitory effect (Supplementary Fig. S4H).
To make sure that the observed metastasis-inhibiting effects
of anti-PrPc antibodies were not due to inhibition of primary
tumor growth, we preinoculated the CCSCs orthotopically into
the cecal wall for 3 weeks. Mice with equivalent tumors were
then grouped and injected with 100 or 200 mg antibodies
weekly. The results clearly showed that the anti-PrPc antibody
inhibited tumor growth and metastasis at the lower dosage
(100 mg/week) and eliminated tumor growth at higher dosage
(200 mg/week; Supplementary Fig. S4I).
PrPc promotes EMT in CCSCs
We consistently observed that the PrPc-overexpressing
CCSCs exhibited an elongated mesenchymal-like morphology,
whereas the PrPc knockdown cells were ﬂatter (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S4G). Also, PrPcþ CRC cells generated branching
colonies with loose cell–cell interaction (see Fig. 2D), characteristic of the EMT phenotype. This prompted us to investigate
whether PrPc promotes EMT, a known mechanism of CSC
migration and invasion. Cells undergoing EMT retain stem
cell functionality and form invasive front colonies (42). We ﬁrst
used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR; primers
shown in Supplementary Table S3) to measure several EMTrelated genes by manipulating PrPc levels. In PrPc overexpressing cells, mesenchymal genes such as N-cadherin and Twist
were signiﬁcantly upregulated, whereas E-cadherin, an epithelial
marker, was downregulated (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In addition, there were increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2
(MMP2) and MMP11 (Supplementary Fig. S5A), which may have
contributed to the metastasis observed in PrPc overexpressing
cells. In contrast, knockdown of PrPc resulted in a reversed
expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Western blot
analysis and double immunoﬂuorescence staining further conﬁrmed the correlation of PrPc with the expression of EMTrelated molecules (Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Twist is a key transcription factor regulating mesenchymal
cell fate, differentiation, and morphogenesis (43). Because PrPc
expression had been found to inﬂuence the expression of Twist
(Supplementary Fig. S5A), we reasoned that PrPc might regulate EMT via Twist. To test this, Twist was ectopically
expressed in CCSCs in which PrPc was stably knocked down
by shRNA. We observed that constitutively overexpressed

2692

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

Twist was indeed able to induce EMT in PrPc-knocked down
CCSCs, leading to increased levels of Snail and N-cadherin
(Fig. 5D). However, overexpression of PrPc in the Twist RNAi
cells was unable to restore EMT, probably because Snail and
N-cadherin expression was lower than in the parental cells
(Fig. 5D). Overall, we conclude that PrPc regulates the EMT
phenotype by modulating Twist.
Next, we used qRT-PCR to measure the mRNA levels of
Twist, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin in CD44þPrPcþ, CD44þ
PrPc, CD44PrPcþ, and CD44PrPc subpopulations of CRC
cells freshly puriﬁed from 6 patients. The results showed that
both Twist and N-cadherin were expressed at signiﬁcantly
higher levels in the PrPc-positive (i.e. CD44þPrPcþ and CD44
PrPcþ) CRC cells than in the PrPc subpopulations (Fig. 5E).
Furthermore, approximately 82% of N-cadherinþ cells were
also PrPcþ, whereas more than 93% of E-cadherinþ cells were
PrPc in CD45EpCAMþ CRC cells as analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 5F). These ﬁndings suggest that PrPc is positively
correlated with the mesenchymal properties of cells from CRC
patients.
Evidence that PrPc-induced EMT is ERK2 dependent
EMT is regulated by the TGF-b and ERK signaling pathways
(44). To understand the molecular mechanisms of PrPcinduced EMT, we ﬁrst assessed the activation of these 2
pathways (45). Knocking down PrPc seemed to result in a
reduction of both Phospho-smad2 and ERK1/2; however, overexpression of PrPc activated ERK1/2 but not smad2, suggesting
that ERK signaling may act downstream of PrPc (Fig. 6A). In
support of this, we found that U0126, an inhibitor of ERK
signaling, suppressed the expression of several EMT-associated molecules (Fig. 6B) as well as EMT itself, especially when
PrPc was overexpressed.
Laminin is a PrPc ligand (46), which, we reasoned, could
activate events occurring downstream of PrPc, such as EMT.
Laminin did enhance both ERK2 phosphorylation and the EMT
phenotype (Fig. 6C and D). Interestingly, PrPc antibody
blocked the laminin-induced ERK activation, EMT protein
expression and EMT morphology in a dose-dependent manner,
(Fig. 6C and D), probably via interference with the interaction
between laminin and its receptor PrPc. Immunoﬂuorescence
staining conﬁrmed that the anti-PrPc antibody attenuated the
laminin-induced N-cadherin expression (Fig. 6E). In addition,
Transwell migration assays revealed that U0126 blocked the
PrPc overexpression-induced migration, and that the anti-PrPc
antibody also attenuated laminin-enhanced migration (Fig.
6F). Our ﬁndings thus suggest that ERK2 signaling pathway is
involved in PrPc-induced EMT.

Discussion
It has been shown that CSCs contribute to both tumor
initiation and cancer metastasis in many tumor systems.
However, in most cases, the underlying mechanisms are not
well understood. In this study, we have identiﬁed a distinct
PrPcþ subpopulation in CD44þ CCSCs that displays enhanced
capacity to regenerate tumors. These results emphasize the
functionalities of PrPc as an "enrichment" factor for CCSC. Our
data show that PrPc is a novel CCSC biomarker, which, by itself,

PrPcþ Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells

functionally contributes to both CRC tumorigenicity and
metastasis. Interestingly, the PrPcþ CRC cells tend to localize
at the invasion fronts in patient tumors, are more mesenchymal, and behave like other cancer cells undergoing EMT,
properties that have probably given these cells a greater
capacity to disseminate and metastasize. These observations
indicate PrPc's role in regulating CCSC likely occurring
through its ability to promote EMT and the exact mechanism
warrants future investigations. In terms of the mechanism
involved, our work implies that PrPc may regulate EMT
through ERK2- and Twist-dependent signaling pathways.
Importantly, the interaction of PrPc with its ligand, laminin,
directly activates ERK2 signaling and promotes EMT. Therefore, conceptually, interference with PrPc expression/functions, the PrPc-laminin interaction or its downstream signaling
events, may be a promising avenue in developing new therapies
targeting PrPcþ CRC cell-mediated metastasis.
Previous work has shown that PrP1, a PrPc ortholog in the
zebra ﬁsh, regulates the stability of E-cadherin mediated cell
adhesion (47), suggesting that PrPc expression may endow the
cell with properties of EMT, which is a developmentally
conserved regulatory mechanism. In addition, PrPc-null
(PRNP0/0) cells display less migratory activity than PRNPþ/þ
cells (48). The more aggressive phenotype of PRNPþ/þ cells is
consistent with our observations that PrPc contributes to
CCSC migration. Recently, CD26þ CRC cells have also been
found to possess CSC properties, with greatly increased metastatic capacity, and, intriguingly, like PrPc, CD26 also functions as an adhesion molecule that binds to ECM (24). These
ﬁndings, together with our present study, strongly suggest that
the enhanced tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of CCSCs
are probably determined by the CSC-intrinsic expression of
functional molecules such as PrPc and CD26, which in turn
mediate the interactions of CSCs with their microenvironment.
Future work will attempt to elucidate the potential relationship between PrPcþ and CD26þ CCSCs.
Previous studies have shown that the expression of PrPc is
positively correlated with invasiveness and drug resistance in
both gastric and breast cancers (27, 49). In addition, Liao and
colleagues have reported that endoglin and PrPc are enriched
in mammosphere-initiating cells (50). Although PrPc has been
reported to be highly expressed in some CRCs (51), as far as we
are aware this is the ﬁrst report linking PrPc to CCSCs, and our
data help to explain how PrPc is associated with cancer
metastasis. The level of PrPc was inversely correlated with
patient survival, suggesting a potential prognostic value in
CRC. It has recently emerged that monoclonal antibodies

targeting surface molecules expressed in CSCs show powerful
therapeutic efﬁcacy by eliminating CSCs and leading to
tumor resolution (16). Our ﬁndings therefore have signiﬁcant
clinical implications, as PrPcþ CSCs may provide important
new targets for therapy in metastatic CRC. Indeed, PrPc
monoclonal antibodies display strong inhibitory effects on
CCSC tumorigenesis and metastasis in orthotopic xenograft
models, suggesting possible therapeutic applications in the
clinic. Overall, our ﬁndings throw new light on the mechanisms underlying CRC cell metastasis and are of clinical
importance for the design of therapeutic strategies for treating CRC.
