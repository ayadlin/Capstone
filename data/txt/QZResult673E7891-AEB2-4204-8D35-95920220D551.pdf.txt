Abstract
Compared with prostaglandin E2, which has an established role in cancer, the role of the COX metabolite
prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in chronic inﬂammation leading to tumorigenesis is uncertain. In this study, we
investigated the role of PGD2 in colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) using genetically modiﬁed
mice and an established model of inﬂammatory colon carcinogenesis. Systemic genetic deﬁciency in
hematopoietic PGD synthase (H-PGDS) aggravated colitis and accelerated tumor formation in a manner
associated with increased TNFa expression. Treatment with a TNFa receptor antagonist attenuated colitis
regardless of genotype. Histologic analysis revealed that inﬁltrated mast cells strongly expressed H-PGDS in
inﬂamed colons. Mast cell–speciﬁc H-PGDS deﬁciency also aggravated colitis and accelerated CAC. In
contrast, treatment with a PGD2 receptor agonist inhibited colitis and CAC. Together, our results identiﬁed
mast cell–derived PGD2 as an inhibitor of colitis and CAC, with implications for its potential use in preventing
or treating colon cancer. Cancer Res; 74(11); 3011–9. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the cause of death for 600 million
people per year in the world and patient numbers are still
increasing. Inherited factors and/or daily habits such as
smoking or alcohol consumption, as well as bacterial/viral
infections, cause bowel inﬂammation, the prolongation of
which leads to tumorigenesis. Epidemiologic studies showed
that patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a
predisposition for colorectal cancer and that the cancer risk
is highly correlated with the duration and severity of inﬂammation (1).
In the chronically inﬂamed colon, inﬁltration of various
types of immune cells such as macrophages, T lymphocytes,
and mast cells is consistently observed (2). These immune cells
produce a large quantity of inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins (PG) that further promote inﬂammation. In the mouse colorectal cancer model, TNFa and one
of the major prostaglandins, PGE2, induce tumorigenesis via an
aberrant activation of NF-kB or Wnt/b-catenin signaling in
epithelial cells (3, 4). Consistently, clinical studies have shown

that treatment with an anti-TNFa antibody or a COX inhibitor
is effective against the development of human colorectal
cancer (5, 6). However, each COX metabolite PG or TNFainduced cytokine possesses a pro- or an anti-inﬂammatory role
and acts coordinately to govern inﬂammatory responses,
eliminate foreign objects, and remodel tissues. Inhibitions of
these upstream signaling potentially cause broad and serious
side effects such as an increase in the susceptibility to infectious diseases or a loss of mucosal healing (7, 8). To develop a
better treatment with fewer side effects to control chronic
inﬂammation and subsequent tumorigenesis, it is indispensable to understand the pathophysiologic contribution of each
immunomodulating factor.
PGD2 is one PG produced by activation of COX and PGD
synthase. Mast cells, macrophages, and helper T (TH)2-type
lymphocytes are reported to express hematopoietic PGD
synthase (H-PGDS) and potentially produce PGD2. There is
controversy over the pathophysiologic roles of PGD2. Several
groups reported its pro-inﬂammatory properties, where PGD2
was shown to enhance the chemotactic activity of immune
cells and to accumulate them in inﬂamed sites, causing
the aggravation of OVA-induced asthma in mice or OVAinduced rhinitis in guinea pigs (9, 10). In contrast, other groups
reported that PGD2 exerted anti-inﬂammatory properties,
where it attenuated 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene–induced contact hypersensitivity and zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice
(11, 12). Our group also showed that PGD2 inhibits vascular
permeability and inﬂammation in acute lung inﬂammation
and implanted tumor models (13, 14). Thus, the role of PGD2
appears to vary with disease type and stage, and its contribution in chronic inﬂammation remains virtually unknown. It is
indispensable to identify what types of cells produce and
receive PGD2 in each disease model to understand its pathogenesis and develop a new therapeutic approach.

We focused here on the contribution of PGD2 in persistent
colitis and the subsequent development of colorectal cancer
and found that tissue-inﬁltrating mast cell–derived PGD2 has
anti-inﬂammatory and antitumorigenic effects.

Animals
H-PGDS–deﬁcient (H-PGDS/) mice on a C57BL/6J background were generated and bred as previously described (15).
Mast cell–deﬁcient mice (KitW-sh/W-sh) were kindly gifted by
RIKEN BRC. The animal care and treatments were performed
in accordance with the guidelines outlined within the Guide to
Animal Use and Care from The University of Tokyo (Tokyo,
Japan). All experimental procedures in this study were
approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the University of Tokyo (P11-576 and P08-258).
Colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer
Eight- to 10-week-old mice received a single injection of the
large intestine–speciﬁc carcinogen AOM [12 mg/kg body
weight, intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. Five days later, mice were
treated with DSS [2% (w/v) in drinking water ad libitum] for
4 days, followed by a 17-day-off period. This treatment cycle
was repeated three times (Fig. 1A). The body weight and
disease activity index (DAI) were measured twice a week. The
DAI was determined as follows: 0, normal stool; 1, soft but
formed; 2, very soft; 3, diarrhea; 4, dysenteric diarrhea. The
colon was excised at each time point and used for the experiments (Supplementary Table S1). In some experiments, mice
were injected with WP9QY (40 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or with
BW245C (150 mg/kg, i.p.) twice a day for each experimental
period (Figs. 3 and 7).
Measurement of urinary tetranor-PGDM
The urinary concentration of a degraded product of PGD2,
tetranor-PGDM, was measured as previously described (13).
Brieﬂy, the collected urine samples were mixed with HCl (to
give a ﬁnal pH of 3.0) and 5 ng of tetranor PGDM-d6 in ethanol
(pH 2.0) was added as an internal control. Then, the samples
were puriﬁed by solid-phase extraction and separated by highperformance liquid chromatography. An LCMS-TQ8030 triple-

quadruple tandem mass spectrometer (Shimadzu) was used
for the measurement. The results are expressed as nanogram of
tetranor-PGDM per milligram of creatinine.
Hematoxylin and eosin and chloroacetate esterase
staining
Colon tissue was ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours
and embedded in parafﬁn, which was then cut into 4-mm-thick
sections for each staining. To identify mast cells, chloroacetate
esterase (CAE) staining was performed using naphthol-AS-D
chloroacetate and counterstained with hematoxylin. The cell
number was counted under a microscope (Nikon ACT-1C for
DXM1200; Nikon) at 400-fold magniﬁcation in four randomly
selected ﬁelds.
Analysis of nuclear b-catenin level
Colon tissue was treated with a low-salt homogenizing
buffer containing 10 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 0.1
mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 0.5 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 3 mg/mL aprotinin,
3 mg/mL leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute and
homogenized. After centrifugation, the supernatant (cytosol
compartment) was removed. The pellet was treated with a
high-salt homogenizing buffer, made by adding 400 mmol/L
NaCl and 20 mmol/L HEPES to the other components of the
low-salt buffer, and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant (nuclear compartment) was collected. The protein
samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. The membranes were
labeled with mouse anti-histone H1 antibody (1:200) or mouse

anti-b-catenin antibody (1:1,000). After secondary antibody
labeling with goat anti-mouse IgG IRdye 800 antibody, the
bands were detected by an Odyssey system (LI-COR
Biosciences).
Reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA extraction was conducted using TRI reagent
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ﬁrst strand of
cDNA was reverse-transcribed using random 9-mer oligonucleotide primers and ReverTra Ace. Quantitative PCR was
performed on a LightCycler Nano system (Roche Diagnostics)
with Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG and speciﬁc
primers for each gene (Supplementary Table S2).
Immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn section. Deparfﬁnized 4-mm-thick sections
were incubated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
30 minutes and then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 15 minutes. Primary
antibody was treated overnight at 4 C. After washing, secondary antibody was treated for 3 hours, followed by reaction with an avidin–biotin peroxidase complex. After the
reaction, sections were treated with 0.02% 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution containing 0.033% hydrogen peroxide. Then, counterstaining by hematoxylin was
performed. The cell number was counted under a microscope (Nikon ACT-1C) at 400-fold magniﬁcation in four
randomly selected ﬁelds.
Cryosection. The ﬁxed colon was dehydrated in 30%
sucrose for 24 hours and then frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T.
Compound 4583 (Sakura Finetechnical Co. Ltd.). The 4-mmthick cryosection was incubated with 0.05% Triton X-100
and 3% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes. Then, the primary antibody
was treated overnight at 4 C. After washing, treatment with
secondary antibody for 3 hours was carried out. Nuclei were
labeled with DAPI (1 mg/mL) for 5 minutes. The images were
photographed using an Eclipse E800 ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon). The Gr-1–positive neutrophil or F4/80 macrophage number was counted at 400-fold magniﬁcation in four
randomly selected ﬁelds.
Bone marrow transplantation
Bone marrow cells were isolated from the humerus, femur,
and tibia of either H-PGDS/ or wild-type (WT) mice. Fiveweek-old recipient mice were subjected to 9 Gy of g-irradiation
and injected intravenously with 2.0  106 bone marrow cells.
Mice were used for experiments 6 weeks after reconstitution.
Then, AOM/DSS treatment was started.
Isolation and adoptive transfer of bone marrow–derived
mast cell
Bone marrow cells were obtained as described above. The
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 mg/mL of streptomycin,
125 ng/mL of amphotericin B, 100 mmol/L of 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/mL of recombinant mouse IL-3. Half of the
medium was changed twice a week. After a 4-week incubation,
more than 90% of the cells were stained positively with

toluidine blue. The cells cultured for 6 to 10 weeks were used
for bone marrow–derived mast cell (BMMC) injection. The 5week-old Kitw-sh/w-sh mice were pre-injected intravenously
with 5.0  106 BMMCs. At 6 weeks after pre-injection, the
mast cells were redistributed to the colon mucosa of the
Kitw-sh/w-sh mice. Then, AOM/DSS treatment was started. In
addition, 1.0  106 BMMCs were injected intravenously every 1
week after AOM treatment.
Flow cytometric analysis
Colon tissues were cut into pieces and incubated in RPMI1640 containing 2 mg/mL of collagenase and 0.3 mg/mL of
dispase for 60 minutes at 37 C. Digested tissues were resuspended in 30% Percoll solution and centrifuged for 15 minutes
at 1,300 rpm to remove undigested tissue. The resulting cell
pellet was washed and resuspended in staining medium (PBS
supplemented with 5% FBS) with ﬂuorochrome-conjugated
mAbs (1:100 each). After washing, ﬂuorescence intensities were
examined by ﬂow cytometry (BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer,
BD Biosciences). Colon-inﬁltrating neutrophils, macrophages,
and mast cells were identiﬁed as CD45þ Gr-1þ, CD45þ F4/80þ,
and CD45þ FceRIþ c-kitþ cells, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean  SEM. Survival curves
were evaluated by the log-rank test. The DAI was assessed by
the Mann–Whitney test for comparison between two groups
and by the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn post hoc test
for comparison between more than two groups. Other data
evaluations were conducted using the unpaired Student t test
for comparison between two groups and by one-way ANOVA,
followed by Tukey test for comparison between more than
two groups. P < 0.05 was regarded as signiﬁcant.

Results
Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase deﬁciency
exacerbates colitis
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that there was no signiﬁcant difference
in morphologic appearance of colon tissue between H-PGDS
na€ve (WT) and H-PGDS/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Few WT mice died with the AOM/DSS treatment, whereas
H-PGDS/ mice exhibited a lower survival rate. This was
obvious especially just after the second (days 21–25) or third
(days 42–46) treatments of DSS (Fig. 1B).
After each DSS treatment, H-PGDS/ but not WT mice
presented with signiﬁcant weight loss, and elevated DAI was
observed in both genotype (Fig. 1C and D). At each time point,
H-PGDS/ mice presented greater DAI scores than did WT
mice.
Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase deﬁciency
exacerbates colitis-associated colon cancer
After the third round of DSS treatment, tumor had formed in
the latter half of the colon in both lines of mice (day 49; Fig. 2A,
tumors are circled in black lines). Colon shortening is a
morphologic index of the severity of colitis. Colon length in
both WT and H-PGDS/ mice was signiﬁcantly decreased
after 3-cycle DSS treatment (Fig. 2B, at day 56). As expected,

H-PGDS/ mice, several tumors had formed by day 42 and
the tumor numbers increased toward the end of the study
(Fig. 2C). Of interest, the tumor sizes at day 56 in both mice
lines were comparable (WT: 1.97  0.12 mm; H-PGDS/ mice:
2.03  0.13 mm; n ¼ 6 each).
Given that PGD2 is produced in response to injurious stimuli
and is quickly metabolized in vivo (half-life: 1.5 minutes;
ref. 16), it is difﬁcult to accurately measure its content in
tissues. We previously showed that the urinary concentration
of a PGD2 metabolite, tetranor-PGDM, can be a stable index of
PGD2 production in tissues. AOM/DSS treatment signiﬁcantly
increased the excretion of tetranor-PGDM in WT mice urine
(Fig. 2D). In contrast, little tetranor-PGDM was detected in HPGDS/ mice even after the treatment. These observations
suggest that PGD2 is produced during the disease progression
and is dependent on H-PGDS activity.

the colon length of H-PGDS/ mice was about 15% shorter
than that of WT mice. In WT mice, a few tumors were detected only at the end point of treatment (day 56; Fig. 2C). In

stimulates carcinogenic signaling
Aberrant activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling is often
observed in patients with colitis-associated colon cancer
(CAC) and in CAC experimental models (17). Upon activation of Wnt signaling, b-catenin translocates into the nucleus and stimulates gene transcription, leading to carcinogenesis. Immunostaining showed that the DSS treatment stimulated nuclear translocation of b-catenin in colon epithelial
cells (day 56) and H-PGDS deﬁciency accelerated it (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In Western blotting, there were
no differences detected in the levels of nuclear b-catenin
protein in the colons of WT and H-PGDS/ at day 26
(n ¼ 5–7, data not shown). However, its level in the colons

of H-PGDS/ was about 1.5-fold higher than that in WT mice
at day 56 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Previous studies showed
that treatment with PGE2 accelerated the nuclear translocation of b-catenin in the human colon cancer cell line, LS-174T
(18). In contrast, treatment with PGD2 (1 mmol/L for 2 hours)
did not inﬂuence the nuclear b-catenin protein level in the
human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 (b-catenin expression; no
treatment, 0.57  0.15; PGD2, 0.51  0.07; n ¼ 6 each). Other
mediators hypersecreted under absence of H-PGDS are likely to
stimulate these signaling processes secondarily.
Hypermethylation of tumor-suppressed genes by DNA
methyltransferases (DNMT) is also implicated in carcinogenesis (19). There are three types of DNMTs, DNMT1, DNMT3a,
and DNMT3b, which contribute to inﬂammation-induced
carcinogenesis (20). As expected, the mRNA expressions of
these three genes in the H-PGDS/ colon were higher than
those of the WT colon on day 26 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
These results suggest that H-PGDS deﬁciency stimulates
tumor formation via stimulation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling
and DNMTs.
Increased secretion of TNFa worsens the colitis in
hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase–deﬁcient mice
After the second round of DSS treatment, the morphology of
the inﬂamed colon was examined. In WT mice, inﬁltration of
some immune cells into the lamina propria, damage of the epithelium, shortened crypts, and lack of epithelial cells were observed (Fig. 3A). H-PGDS deﬁciency worsened these manifestations
(the black arrow indicates the loss of epithelium and # shows the
immune cell inﬁltration; Fig. 3A). Next, mRNA expression levels
of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1b, TNFa, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and COX-2 were conﬁrmed
by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). AOM/DSS treatment
increased the mRNA expressions of these genes in inﬂamed colon
tissues of both lines of mice (at day 26). As expected, H-PGDS
deﬁciency elevated their expressions (for IL-1b, not signiﬁcant, P ¼ 0.13). In particular, the expression of TNFa in the
H-PGDS/ colon was elevated up to 4.2-fold that of WT.
TNFa signaling is crucial for AOM/DSS-induced colitis and
tumor formation (3). It is possible that PGD2 attenuates the
colitis and subsequent tumor formation by inhibiting TNFa
signaling. Next, we explored the effect of a TNFa receptor I
antagonist, WP9QY, on the colitis. Treatment with WP9QY (40
mg/kg s.c., twice a day) decreased the DAI at day 4 in both lines
of mice (Fig. 3D; in WT mice, the score was decreased but not
signiﬁcant, P ¼ 0.08). The scores for H-PGDS/ mice were
decreased to the similar level of WT mice. Consistently, histologic study revealed that WP9QY treatment ameliorated the
immune cell inﬁltration to the lamina propria or the inﬂammation-induced thickened muscularis mucosa in H-PGDS/
mice (day 4, Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the aggravated
inﬂammation observed under H-PGDS–deﬁcient condition is
partly through hyperactivation of the TNFa signaling.

deﬁciency aggravated the colitis (DAI, Fig. 4A; colon
length, Fig. 4B) and tumor formation (Fig. 4C) in WT mice,
and in contrast, hematopoietic lineage–speciﬁc reconstitution
of H-PGDS repressed the severe manifestations in H-PGDS/
mice.
We then attempted to identify H-PGDS–expressing cells.
Immunostaining showed that c-kit- or FceRI-positive mast
cells strongly expressed H-PGDS in the inﬂamed WT colon
(day 26, Fig. 5A and B). F4/80- or CD68-positive macrophages, CD4-positive T cells, CD8-positive T cells, and Gr-1–
positive neutrophils did not express H-PGDS (Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, c-kit–positive mast
cells and CD68-positive macrophages, but not Gr-1–positive
neutrophils, expressed TNFa, which elevated in the inﬂamed
H-PGDS/ colon (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The number of Gr-1–positive neutrophils, F4/80-positive
macrophages, and CAE-positive mast cells that inﬁltrated the
lamina propria and muscularis mucosa were signiﬁcantly
bigger in H-PGDS/ mice than that of WT mice (day 26, Fig.
5D and Supplementary Fig. S5), especially the mast cell inﬁltration, which increased to about 2.4-fold of WT by H-PGDS
deﬁciency. Similar observations were obtained in ﬂow cytometric analysis as well (day 4, Supplementary Fig. S5D).

contribution of mast cells to carcinogenesis. However,
Kitw-sh/w-sh mice, which lack mature mast cells because of
mutation in the c-kit gene (21), showed similar sensitivities
against AOM/DSS treatment as did mast cell na€ve WT mice
(DAI: Fig. 6B, days 4 and 25; tumor formation: Fig. 6C, day 56;
colon length: Fig. 6D, day 56). Reconstitution of the WT
mast cells did not inﬂuence these scores in Kitw-sh/w-sh mice.
In contrast, reconstitution of the H-PGDS/ mast cells
markedly increased DAI, decreased colon length, and stimulated carcinogenesis (Fig. 6B–D). These data provided
direct evidence that mast cell–derived PGD2 protects
against colitis and CAC.

DP signaling attenuates colitis and tumor formation
induced by AOM/DSS
Given that stimulation of the PGD2 receptor represents antiinﬂammatory reactions in acute lung inﬂammation and peritonitis (11, 14), it is possibly beneﬁcial against colitis and/or
CAC. Supporting this idea, treatment with a DP agonist,
BW245C (150 mg/kg i.p., twice a day), suppressed the DAI (Fig.
7B, days 6 and 27) and attenuated the tumor formation in both
lines of mice (Fig. 7C, day 56). Consistently, treatment with
BW245C attenuated the inﬁltration of immune cells (Fig. 7E,
day 27) and thickening of the mucosa (Fig. 7A). The TNFa

Discussion
We showed here that mast cell–derived PGD2 inhibits
chemical-induced colitis and CAC and that this anti-inﬂammatory property of PGD2 is at least partly due to its inhibitory
effect on TNFa-production.
Colorectal cancer often develops as a consequence of the
repeated remission and recurrence of inﬂammation in patients
with IBD. We used the mouse CAC model made by a single
injection of a large intestine–speciﬁc carcinogen (AOM) and
multiple injections of an enterocolitis-inducing chemical
(DSS). In this model, tumors were formed in the colic latter
half (Fig. 2A). This onset site is the same as that seen in patients
with chronic enterocolitis-associated colorectal cancer. There
are regional variations in the types of immune cells (22) and
bacterial ﬂora (23) found throughout the intestines, which are

both implicated in the pathogenesis of CAC. The latter half of
the colon may be more tumorigenic in terms of host defense
system and microbiota than the other parts.
Ever since epidemiologic studies showed that the inhibition
of COX-dependent PG synthesis is beneﬁcial against colitis/
CAC, PGs have been categorized in exacerbating factors. There
are several studies showing the pro-inﬂammatory and tumorigenic effects of a major prostaglandin, PGE2. The colon tissue
of patients with IBD contains a high level of PGE2. Administration of PGE2 worsened 2,4,6-trinirobenzene sulfonic acid
(TNBS)-induced colitis in mice (24) and stimulated the proliferative activity and survival maintenance of cancer cells in
the mouse AOM-treated colon cancer model (25). Another
prostaglandin, TXA2, enhanced aggravated colitis by enhancing esterase release from neutrophils in the Syrian hamster
TNBS-induced colitis model (26). In a colon carcinoma xenograft model, TXA2 induced tumor cell growth and angiogenesis
in the tumor sites (27). In contrast to these reports, we
identiﬁed here PGD2 as an anti-inﬂammatory and antitumorigenic factor in colitis/CAC. Thus, COX and its metabolites
appear to be related to tumor development through multiple
mechanisms.
Although mast cells have been emerged as a modulator of
tumor onset and growth, their contribution is still unclear.
Several studies suggested a correlation between the presence
of mast cells and a poor prognosis in human tumors, such as
lung cancer and pancreatic cancer (28, 29). Other studies
suggested a correlation between the presence of mast cells
and a good prognosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer (30,
31). Experimental studies also showed a controversial role of
mast cells in tumorigenesis. Mast cell deﬁciency (W/Wv mice)
decreased the susceptibility to intestinal tumorigenesis
induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine or H-Ras–induced skin carcinogenesis (32, 33). Other studies showed that mast cells
secrete a variety of tumor-promoting mediators, including
TNFa, PGE2, and IL-6 (34). In contrast, mast cells were
reported to induce tumor apoptosis in APCMin/þ mice (35).
Our data showed that mast cell deﬁciency did not inﬂuence the
severity of colitis/CAC (Fig. 6B–D). Similar observations were
obtained in DSS-induced colitis of mast cell–deﬁcient W/Wv
mice (36). Thus, the mast cell is assumed to possess both proand antitumorigenic properties and its contributions vary
according to the type and stage of tumor.
H-PGDS deﬁciency accelerated the inﬁltration of mast
cells as well as macrophages and neutrophils into the
inﬂamed colon (Fig. 5D), which is accompanied by abnormal
expressions of MCP-1 and TNFa (Fig. 3B). Both inﬁltrated
mast cells and macrophages expressed TNFa in the inﬂamed
colon (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). We previously
showed that MCP-1 was expressed mainly in inﬁltrated
macrophages in implanted tumor (13). Mast cell–derived
PGD2 may restrict abnormal production of these cytokines
by mast cell itself and macrophage, thus governing inﬂammatory responses. Further investigations are required to
clarify this point.
Successive treatment with the DP agonist attenuated colitis/
CAC (Fig. 7). Concordantly, there is a report showing that DP
agonism inhibited TNBS-induced colitis in the rat (37). DP

agonism stimulated IL-10 secretion from dendritic cells, which
is a well-known anti-inﬂammatory cytokine in colitis (38).
A degrading product of PGD2, 15d-PGJ2, also can diminish
colitis in mice and have antitumor effects by activating PPARg
or inhibiting NF-kB signaling (11, 39). PGD2 signaling may thus
interact with such anti-inﬂammatory signaling and control
colitis/CAC.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that mast cell–produced
PGD2 inhibited prolonged colitis and subsequent tumor formation by attenuating TNFa signaling. Our ﬁndings implicate
the therapeutic potential of enhancing the PGD2 signaling for
IBD and CAC.
