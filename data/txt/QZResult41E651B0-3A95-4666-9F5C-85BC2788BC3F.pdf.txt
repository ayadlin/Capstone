Abstract
Cdc25 dual specificity phosphatases positively regulate the cell
cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin complexes.
Of the three mammalian Cdc25 isoforms, Cdc25A is phosphorylated by genotoxic stress–activated Chk1 or Chk2, which
triggers its SCFB-TrCP–mediated degradation. However, the
roles of Cdc25B and Cdc25C in cell stress checkpoints remain
inconclusive. We herein report that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) induces the degradation of Cdc25B. Nongenotoxic stress
induced by anisomycin caused rapid degradation of Cdc25B as
well as Cdc25A. Cdc25B degradation was dependent mainly
on JNK and partially on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38). Accordingly, cotransfection with JNK1, JNK2, or p38 destabilized Cdc25B. In vitro kinase assays and site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the critical JNK and p38
phosphorylation site in Cdc25B was Ser101. Cdc25B with Ser101
mutated to alanine was refractory to anisomycin-induced degradation, and cells expressing such mutant Cdc25B proteins
were able to override the anisomycin-induced G2 arrest. These
results highlight the importance of a novel JNK/p38-Cdc25B
axis for a nongenotoxic stress–induced cell cycle checkpoint.

Introduction
Cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells requires the successive activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)cyclin complexes. Activation of CDK-cyclin complexes depends on
members of the Cdc25 dual specificity phosphatases. In mammalian cells, the Cdc25 family consists of Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and
Cdc25C. Although Cdc25C was the first member to be identified,
Cdc25A is now regarded as one of the major players in multiple
phases of cell cycle progression in mammalian somatic cells (1, 2).
Besides its well-known role in G1-S transition, Cdc25A is also
involved in the G2-M transition and chromosome condensation (1,
3, 4). Moreover, Cdc25A is also a well-known target of the DNA
damage checkpoint (2, 5). On genotoxic insults, Cdc25A is rapidly
phosphorylated by the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 followed
by SCFh-TrCP–mediated ubiquitinylation and degradation (2, 6).
In contrast to Cdc25A, the roles of Cdc25B and Cdc25C remain
elusive. Experiments with Cdc25B- or Cdc25C-knockout mice indi-

cate that these genes are dispensable not only for normal cell cycle
control but also for the DNA damage checkpoint (7, 8). The only
prominent phenotype is a defect in oocyte maturation in Cdc25Bdepleted female mice (9). However, several lines of evidence suggest
that Cdc25B is important for controlling CDK1-cyclin B activity at
the centrosome, where the kinase contributes to centrosome separation at prophase (4, 10). Chk1 is believed to down-regulate the
activity of Cdc25B until prophase (11, 12). The phosphorylation
of Cdc25B (Ser309 of Cdc25B1 or Ser323 in Cdc25B3) has also been
implicated in the function of Cdc25B in conjunction with 14-3-3
binding (13, 14). A mutation that abolishes the specific phosphorylation site causes Cdc25B to localize to the nucleus and enhances
its ability to abrogate DNA damage–induced G2 arrest (15, 16).
These results suggest that despite its nonessentiality in mouse
models, Cdc25B does play some role in the G2-M transition (14).
Stress stimuli that do not target genome DNA lead to the
activation of the so-called stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), including p38 MAPK (p38) and c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK; ref. 17). Recently, MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2)
has received attention for its ability to phosphorylate Cdc25B,
leading to 14-3-3 binding (18). MK2 is usually complexed with and
activated by p38 (18). Therefore, a fraction of p38 can be found to
coimmunoprecipitate with MK2, which could mislead one to believe that p38 phosphorylates substrates that are normally phosphorylated exclusively by MK2. The p38-MK2 cascade is, therefore,
believed to regulate cell cycle progression by controlling the stability and subcellular localization of Cdc25A and Cdc25B, respectively, when cells are exposed to genotoxic or nongenotoxic stress
(14, 18–20). JNK also phosphorylates and inactivates Cdc25C (21).
In addition, nuclear Cdc25B is exported to the cytoplasm on UV or
nongenotoxic stress by an unknown mechanism (22).
We previously reported that overexpression of 14-3-3 causes the
relocation of Cdc25B from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (13, 23, 24).
To delineate the role of the cytoplasmic export of Cdc25B, we
established HeLa cell lines that constitutively express Cdc25B and
investigated conditions that induce nuclear export of the phosphatase. We found that nongenotoxic stress, but not genotoxic cell
stress, induced loss of Cdc25B nuclear localization and that nongenotoxic stress was also an effective inducer of Cdc25B degradation. Moreover, we found that the stability of Cdc25B could be
controlled by JNK and p38. These data reveal a novel pathway
linking the stress response kinases to the G2-M cell cycle engine.

Cdc25B Degradation Triggered by JNK and p38MAPK
MKK6-activated p38a (both isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells)
were obtained from Upstate. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen.
The cDNAs and antibodies used in the experiments were described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell culture and plasmid transfection. HeLa cells were grown in
DMEM as previously described (13). Plasmids were transiently transfected
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell cycle synchronization was performed using the double thymidine block protocol. To obtain stable
Flag-tagged Cdc25B (F-Cdc25B)–expressing HeLa cells, we used 10 Ag/mL
blasticidin S (Invitrogen) for the selection of transformed cells. Established
Flag-Cdc25B–expressing HeLa cells were maintained with 2 Ag/mL blasticidin S.
Preparation of crude extracts, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assay. Crude extracts for the analysis of proteins followed
by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation were performed as described
previously (13). To detect endogenous Cdc25B, we subjected proteins that
had been immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Cdc25B antibodies to SDSPAGE, followed by immunoblotting. The Cdc25B protein was detected with
mouse monoclonal anti-Cdc25B antibody. The immunoprecipitates used for
the kinase assay were washed twice with buffer containing 100 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmol/L EGTA, and 20 mmol/L MgCl2. The samples were then incubated with the same buffer that was supplemented
with appropriate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion Cdc25B proteins,
1 mmol/L DTT, 200 Amol/L ATP, and [g-32P]ATP (1 ACi = 37 KBq; PerkinElmer). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30jC for 60 min and
subjected to SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity was detected using the Fuji BAS
system (Fujifilm).
Indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Indirect immunofluorescence of cells grown on glass coverslips was conducted as described
previously (13). Cells treated for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using ModFit software.
The Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 (phospho-S10-H3)–positive cells were
analyzed using CellQuest software.

Results
Nuclear localization of Cdc25B is lost following treatment of
cells with anisomycin but not with DNA-damaging agents.
Phosphorylation of Ser309 of Cdc25B1 followed by binding of 14-3-3
disrupts nuclear localization of Cdc25B (13). Ser309 can be phosphorylated by Chk1/2 and MK2 (18, 25, 26). To determine the types
of cellular stresses that induce nuclear export, we treated cells with
various chemicals and analyzed the subcellular localization of
Cdc25B. Given that an antibody that displayed high specificity
toward endogenous Cdc25B was not available commercially or in
house, we first established a HeLa cell–based cell line that constitutively expressed F-Cdc25B. No gross abnormality of cell growth
or morphology was discerned for F-Cdc25B–expressing cells, which
are hereafter called HeLa-W40 cells.
We treated HeLa-W40 cells with hydroxyurea, aphidicolin,
etoposide, or camptothecin, which activate either Chk1 or Chk2.
DNA damage induced by the chemicals was confirmed by assaying
for phosphorylated histone H2AX (g-H2AX; ref. 27). Cdc25B localized to the nucleus in cells with or without DNA damage or
replication arrest (Fig. 1A). We next investigated the possible involvement of the p38/MK2 pathways in this process. To activate
the p38/MK2 pathway, we treated the cells with anisomycin, which
activates p38 and JNK (28, 29). Treatment with anisomycin disrupted the nuclear localization of Cdc25B and promoted the redistribution of Cdc25B to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). These results
suggest that Cdc25B nuclear localization can be disrupted by stress
pathways other than those initiated by DNA damage.
To assess the possibility that the p38 pathway regulates Cdc25B,
we added the p38 inhibitor SB202190 to HeLa-W40 cells. Of interest

Figure 1. Nuclear localization of Cdc25B is maintained after DNA damage
but is disturbed by anisomycin treatment. A, HeLa-W40 cells were
treated with the indicated chemicals and Flag-Cdc25B and g-H2AX were
detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The nuclei were identified using
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The conditions for chemical treatment were
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. B, HeLa-W40 cells were
treated with 50 ng/mL anisomycin for 15 min and processed for indirect
immunofluorescence. C, HeLa-W40 cells were pretreated with the indicated
MAPK inhibitors for 1 h followed by anisomycin challenge. The cells were fixed,
and Flag-Cdc25B and nuclei were analyzed. The concentration for inhibitors
was as follows: SB202190, 20 Amol/L; SP600125, 20 Amol/L.

is that SB202190 exerted only a small effect on the anisomycininduced diffusion of Cdc25B (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the JNK inhibitor
SP600125 induced strong nuclear staining of Cdc25B under conditions of anisomycin stress. Furthermore, stronger nuclear signals
for Cdc25B were generated by simultaneous treatment with both
SB202190 and SP600125 than by treatment with SP600125 alone.
Inhibition of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK1) with U0126, thereby inhibiting the activation of
ERK1/2, did not prevent cytoplasmic diffusion of Cdc25B (data not
shown). Collectively, these data indicate that anisomycin-mediated
stress can disrupt nuclear localization of Cdc25B in a JNK-dependent
manner.
Cdc25B is degraded in cells treated with anisomycin or
sodium chloride but not with DNA-damaging agents. The signals
for F-Cdc25B faded in cells after long-term exposure to anisomycin
but not after treatment with DNA-damaging agents (data not
shown). These observations led us to analyze the level of F-Cdc25B
protein in HeLa-W40 cells treated with anisomycin and another

nongenotoxic reagent, sodium chloride (NaCl). We also examined
the levels of Cdc25A and Cdc25C to determine whether different cellular stresses affect members of this phosphatase family.
Genotoxic stress caused by exposure to hydroxyurea, aphidicolin,
etoposide, or camptothecin effectively induced Cdc25A degradation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of Cdc25B or Cdc25C was unaffected under the same conditions. Although neither anisomycin
nor NaCl activated Chk1 or Chk2, both Cdc25B and Cdc25A
were degraded (Fig. 2A). Cdc25A and Cdc25B decreased in a timedependent fashion after exposure to anisomycin (Fig. 2B). The
endogenous Cdc25B protein in parental HeLa cells was also degraded by anisomycin treatment but not by DNA-damaging agents
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The abundance of Cdc25C was not affected by any of the stimuli examined here. UV irradiation, which is
known to activate not only Chk1/2 but also p38/JNK, abrogated
nuclear localization of Cdc25B as reported (22) and induced Cdc25B
degradation (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
Although anisomycin inhibits protein synthesis (29), the more
rapid decline of Cdc25B in anisomycin-treated cells compared with
cycloheximide-treated cells suggested that degradation of Cdc25B
was specifically caused by anisomycin-induced stress and not by a
general inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 2C). More convincing
evidence was obtained when we examined the stability of Cdc25B
that contained mutations at the constitutive h-TrCP binding site
of 254DDGFVD259 (amino acid numbering is based on human
Cdc25B1; ref. 30). The site is responsible for the steady-state degradation of Cdc25B by a constitutive SCFh-TrCP–mediated ubiquitinproteasome pathway. We established a HeLa cell line expressing a
mutant Cdc25B that contained mutations at the h-TrCP binding
site (Cdc25BDAA, of which D255 and G256 were replaced by Ala).

Figure 2D shows that Cdc25BDAA was unstable after anisomycin
treatment. This indicates that the Cdc25B degradation was specific
to anisomycin treatment. Collectively, these data indicate that
anisomycin-induced stress, but not DNA damage–induced stress,
triggers a loss of nuclear localization and stability of Cdc25B.
Inhibition of JNK attenuates the degradation of Cdc25B by
anisomycin. To determine the role of p38 or JNK on the stability of
Cdc25A and Cdc25B, we treated HeLa cells with inhibitors of p38 or
JNK and analyzed the cellular proteins. The activation of p38a/h
was monitored as the slower migrating form of MK2, corresponding to phosphorylated MK2 (Fig. 3A); JNK activation was monitored using antibodies recognizing phospho-JNK1 or phospho–c-Jun.
We found that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 protected Cdc25B from
anisomycin-induced degradation (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8). A relatively
small but definite contribution of the p38 pathway to the degradation of Cdc25B was revealed by these experiments (Fig. 3A,
lanes 3–8). The MEK1 inhibitor U0126 again had no effect on the
stability of either Cdc25A or Cdc25B (data not shown). Time course
experiments further validated the critical role of JNK in regulating the degradation of Cdc25B (Fig. 3B). The stability of Cdc25C
was essentially unaffected by these inhibitors (Fig. 3A). Exactly
the same results were obtained with HeLa-W40 cells that expressed
F-Cdc25B (Supplementary Fig. S3A). JNK inhibitor also attenuated the NaCl-induced F-Cdc25B degradation (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Results shown in Fig. 3C indicate the correlation between
the degradation of Cdc25A/Cdc25B and activation of p38/JNK.
Anisomycin-, NaCl-, or UV-induced degradation of Cdc25B was
inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that the
anisomycin-induced degradation of Cdc25B is mediated by the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Supplementary Fig. S3C, 1, 2, and 3).

Cdc25B Degradation Triggered by JNK and p38MAPK

phorylate Cdc25B (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Likewise, recombinant
JNK1 could also phosphorylate Cdc25B (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
To identify the phosphorylation site(s) on Cdc25B, GST fusion
constructs of different fragments of Cdc25B were produced in
Escherichia coli and used as substrates for kinase assays. As shown
in Fig. 5A, JNK phosphorylation sites were present in the NH2terminal 175 amino acids. The same fragment was also phosphorylated by recombinant p38a (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Furthermore,
JNK and Cdc25B were able to form complex, which supports the
idea of Cdc25B being a JNK substrate [Supplementary Fig. S5A; the
loss of the complex formation in wild-type (WT) JNK with MKK7
suggests that JNK may dislodge after phosphorylation event]. The
importance of the NH2-terminal region was also supported by
the JNK-induced degradation of the construct containing green
fluorescent protein fused to the NH2-terminal 175 amino acid
fragment of Cdc25B (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Cdc25B/S101 is a candidate JNK phosphorylation site. To
identify JNK phosphorylation site(s), we first mutated all six candidate serine residues to alanine in six potential JNK substrate
SP sequences (and no TP) in N175-Cdc25B. The 6SA mutant was
refractory to JNK- or p38a-induced degradation (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). The coexpression of the individual SA mutant Cdc25B
with JNK indicated the importance of S101, followed by S103
(Fig. 5B). The importance of S101 and S103 was further supported

Figure 3. JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuates the anisomycin-induced Cdc25B

after anisomycin addition. SB, SB202190; SP, SP600125. B, HeLa cells were
treated with MAPK inhibitors, and the expression of proteins was determined at
the indicated time. C, HeLa-W40 cells were treated with anisomycin, and the
expression of protein was determined at the indicated time. Slower migrating
bands of c-Jun and MK2 represent phosphorylated forms of the proteins.

Results of indirect immunofluorescence also supported that the
instability of Cdc25B in anisomycin-treated cells was due to its
proteasome-dependent degradation (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
The coexpression of either JNK1 or JNK2 with MKK7 triggered
Cdc25B degradation (Fig. 4A). In addition, p38a was able to induce
Cdc25B degradation. Furthermore, the expression of kinase-dead
JNK1 and JNK2 stabilized Cdc25B (Fig. 4B), indicating dominantnegative effects. We further examined the contribution of MK2 to
Cdc25B degradation. In this experiment, we used the D316N mutant of p38a, which is unable to activate MK2 (31). As shown in
Fig. 4C, expression of p38aD316N induced the degradation of Cdc25B.
Taken together, these results suggest that JNK and p38 are integrally involved in Cdc25B degradation.
JNK phosphorylates Cdc25B. We found that bacterially expressed Cdc25B was phosphorylated by kinase-active JNK1 but not
by its kinase-dead form, indication that JNK1 can directly phos-

by the slower degradation rate of the Cdc25B protein with a double
mutation (S101/103A) compared with the mutants with a single
mutation (Fig. 5C, lanes 4, 6, and 8). Essentially the same results
were obtained when p38a was used as a kinase for the Cdc25B
mutants (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Taken together, these data
indicate that phosphorylation of Cdc25B at S101 and S103 by JNK
and p38 is important for degradation.
HeLa cells expressing the Cdc25B S101A mutant ignore
anisomycin-induced G2 arrest. We next examined the effects of
anisomycin on cell cycle progression, in particular during G2-M
phase, when Cdc25B peaks during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were
synchronized at G1-S and released into S phase. At 6 hours after
release, the cells were treated with anisomycin followed by monitoring of M-phase entry by detection of phospho-S10-H3. Cdc25B
and phospho-S10-H3 increased progressively in DMSO-treated cells

(Fig. 6A), but no phospho-S10-H3 was detected in anisomycintreated cells, indicating that anisomycin treatment inhibited
mitotic entry. In such cells, Cdc25B disappeared completely by
30 minutes after addition of anisomycin (Fig. 6A, lanes 7 and 8).
FACS analysis confirmed the induction of a G2 delay by anisomycin
treatment in synchronously or asynchronously growing HeLa cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7A).
To delineate the significance of Cdc25B S101 phosphorylation in
anisomycin-induced G2 arrest, we added anisomycin to asynchronously growing HeLa cells that constitutively express the nonphosphorylatable Cdc25B S101A mutant (HeLa-101-1). The results
shown in Fig. 6B indicate that the half-life of the S101A mutant
Cdc25B was twice as long as that of the WT after anisomycin
treatment (f35 minutes in S101A and f15 minutes in WT),
indicating that phosphorylation of S101 is essential for proper
degradation. Treatment of HeLa-101-1 with either NaCl or UV also
supported the idea that S101 is important for stress-induced
Cdc25B degradation (Supplementary Fig. S8A).
We next investigated whether the S101A mutant would exhibit
abrogation of anisomycin-induced G2 arrest. We used cell lines
expressing WT Cdc25B (W40) or S101A (101-1). The amount of
Cdc25B protein in W40 cells and that of 101-1 is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S7B. Asynchronously growing HeLa cells, W40
cells, and 101-1 cells were treated with 100 ng/mL anisomycin, and
the number of cells entering M phase during a 3-hour treatment
with anisomycin was determined by detecting phospho-S10-H3.
As shown in Fig. 6C, HeLa-101-1 cells exhibited resistance to
anisomycin-induced G2 retardation. Thus, cells expressing S101Amutated Cdc25B seem to be more resistant to anisomycin-induced
degradation and to recover more rapidly than WT Cdc25Bexpressing cells.
Collectively, HeLa cells expressing Cdc25B with a nonphosphorylatable mutation at the possible JNK target S101 residue were
more refractory to anisomycin-induced cell cycle retardation.

We report here for the first time that Cdc25B is targeted for
degradation in cells that are challenged with anisomycin or NaCl
and that the degradation of Cdc25B is mediated mainly by JNK. We
uncovered this phenomenon by using HeLa cells that constitutively
expressed recombinant Cdc25B. In our hands, commercially available antibodies did not properly recognize endogenous Cdc25B in
crude extracts by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation followed
by immunoblotting was necessary to detect endogenous Cdc25B.
Our experiments highlight the critical role of JNK in controlling
Cdc25B stability. A level of DNA damage that is sufficient for
activating Chk1/2 and Cdc25A degradation did not exert any effects on the stability of Cdc25B. Export of Cdc25B from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm is thought to be a mechanism of checkpoint response (18). However, Cdc25B did not follow this expected pattern
after DNA damage (Fig. 1A). We therefore suspect that Cdc25B
is not a primary target of the DNA damage checkpoint, although
we cannot exclude the possibility that its phosphatase activity is
directly repressed by a Chk1-dependent mechanism (32).
We showed that M-phase entry is delayed in HeLa cells treated
with anisomycin (Fig. 6). The G2 retardation observed in this situation is caused in part by the degradation of Cdc25A and Cdc25B.
Depletion of either Cdc25A or Cdc25B is insufficient for G2-phase
arrest, but the depletion of both Cdc25A and Cdc25B is necessary
for a more robust G2 arrest (4). Therefore, anisomycin-induced G2

Cdc25B Degradation Triggered by JNK and p38MAPK

Figure 6. The Cdc25B mutant is
refractory to anisomycin-induced G2
arrest. A, HeLa cells synchronized at G1-S
were released into the cell cycle for 6 h,
followed by the addition of anisomycin.
At the indicated times, the expression of
proteins was determined. B, HeLa-W40
or HeLa-101-1 cells were treated with
anisomycin, and the expression of the
proteins was determined at the indicated
time points after treatment. Bottom,
quantitative results. Typical results of three
independent experiments are shown.
C, asynchronously growing HeLa,
HeLa-W40, or HeLa-101-1 cells were
treated with 100 ng/mL anisomycin and
100 ng/mL nocodazole for 3 h. Cells were
collected, and the cells in M phase were
determined by detecting phospho-histone
H3-Ser10 by FACS. Columns, mean of
three independent experiments; bars,
SD. The percentage of mitotic cells in
asynchronous cells was as follows: HeLa,
2.76 F 0.27; W40, 3.57 F 0.13; 101-1,
3.61 F 0.14. D, a model of the induction
of Cdc25A and Cdc25B degradation after
nongenotoxic stress followed by G2 arrest.

retardation can be explained at least in part by the simultaneous
degradation of Cdc25A and Cdc25B (Fig. 2). Our results strongly
suggest the presence of a nongenotoxic stress–dependent cell cycle
checkpoint wherein Cdc25 phosphatases are degraded to downregulate CDK activity. This checkpoint is mediated by stressactivated MAPKs, including p38 and JNK, as depicted in Fig. 6D.
The proteasome inhibitor MG132 attenuated anisomycin-induced
Cdc25B degradation, which strongly suggests that Cdc25B is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Cdc25B is degraded
in the steady state by the SCFh-TrCP–mediated ubiquitinylation
mechanism. It is unlikely that phosphorylation of S101 stimulated
binding of SCFh-TrCP to the constitutive binding site, which is
located more than 100 amino acids downstream of S101. It is
necessary to identify the responsible ubiquitinylation system to
understand JNK-mediated Cdc25B degradation more precisely.
Several reports have indicated a correlation between the malignancy of tumors and the overexpression of Cdc25A and Cdc25B
(33, 34). Cdc25A and Cdc25B are oncogenic (35), and Cdc25A is a
main target of the DNA damage checkpoint (1, 2, 34). Assuming
that Cdc25B is a target of a nongenotoxic stress checkpoint, overexpression of Cdc25B may allow cells to become less sensitive to
intrinsically harmful cell stresses that do not directly compromise
genome integrity. Ignoring the detrimental stress signal, such as
NaCl-induced distortion of the cytoskeleton by hyperosmolarity or

anisomycin-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, may disrupt
the proper regulation of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis
during mitosis, which are well-known causative events of genome
instability (36).
In conclusion, we have shown that Cdc25B is targeted for JNKmediated degradation by cellular stress. The stress-induced
checkpoint is initiated by the activation of JNK and p38, which
phosphorylates Ser101 of Cdc25B. This results in the rapid degradation of Cdc25B and cell cycle arrest.
