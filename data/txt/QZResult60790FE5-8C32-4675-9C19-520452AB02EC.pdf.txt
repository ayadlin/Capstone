ABSTRACT
One of the properties of human breast cancer cells is cancer stemness, which
is characterized by self-renewal capability and drug resistance. Protein kinase D1
(PRKD1) functions as a key regulator of many cellular processes and is downregulated
in invasive breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that PRKD1 was upregulated in
MCF-7-ADR human breast cancer cells characterized by drug resistance. Additionally,
we discovered that PRKD1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-34a binding
to the PRKD1 3′-UTR. PRKD1 expression increased following performance of a
tumorsphere formation assay in MCF-7-ADR cells. We also found that reduction
of PRKD1 by ectopic miR-34a expression or PRKD1 siRNA treatment resulted
in suppressed self-renewal ability in breast cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we
confirmed that the PRKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101 reduced phosphorylated PKD/PKCμ,
leading to suppression of breast cancer stemness through GSK3/β-catenin signaling.
PRKD1 inhibition also influenced apoptosis initiation in MCF-7-ADR cells. Tumors from
nude mice treated with miR-34a or CRT0066101 showed suppressed tumor growth,
proliferation, and induced apoptosis. These results provide evidence that regulation
of PRKD1, a novel miR-34a target, contributes to overcoming cancer stemness and
drug resistance in human breast cancer.

previous studies reporting that ectopic expression of miR34c suppressed epithelial–mesenchymal transition and
reduced self-renewal capacity in BCSCs [8].
The serine/threonine-protein kinase D1 (PRKD1)
functions as diacylglycerol and protein kinase C (PKC)
effectors that mediate the actions of stimuli [9]. Processes
associated with protein kinase D (PKD)/PKCμ were
activated by two phosphorylation loops through PKCdependent phosphorylation (Ser744/Ser748) and PKCindependent autophosphorylation (Ser910) [10-13].
Therefore, PRKD1 is considered as a key regulator of
many cellular processes, including initiation of the NF-kB
signaling pathway, enhancement of cell cycle progression
and DNA synthesis, and regulation of other pathological
conditions [14-16].

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer
and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women
worldwide [1]. Despite efforts to improve patient survival
rates, problems associated with breast cancer therapy,
including cancer metastasis and drug resistance, remain [2,
3]. Tumors are organized with cancer stem cells (CSCs)
and non-tumorigenic cells forming a tumor mass [4]. CSCs
are considered the cause of tumors, cancer metastasis,
drug resistance, and cancer relapse [5]. Specifically, CSCs
in breast cancer (BCSC) display stem-cell properties and
are characterized by expression of the cell-surface marker
CD44+/CD24- [6]. Different miRNAs are involved in
the formation and regulation of human BCSCs [7], with

RESULTS

MicroRNA regulates apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and
angiogenesis in breast cancer. A key regulator of tumor
suppression, miR-34 is a direct transcriptional target of the
tumor suppressor p53, given that the miR-34a promoter
region contains a p53-binding site [17]. In breast cancer
studies, miR-34a played a role in preventing cell survival
by upregulating p53 post-irradiation after DNA had
been damaged [18]. Additionally, miR-34a promoted
cancer-cell apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2 and SIRT1 [19].
Therefore, miR-34a may be associated with targets that
induce breast cancer.
In this study, we found that overexpressed PRKD1
was inhibited by miR-34a in MCF-7-ADR cells.
Furthermore, PRKD1 activated the self-renewal capacity
in BCSCs through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)/βcatenin signaling, and contributed to the elimination of drug
resistance. These results suggest important roles for PRKD1,
a novel miR-34a target, in human breast cancer therapy.

miR-34a suppresses PRKD1 in
MCF-7-ADR cells
We evaluated PRKD1 expression in breast cancer cell
lines, including MCF-10A, MCF-7, ZR-75-1, MCF-7-ADR,
SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468. The results
indicated increased PRKD1 expression levels in MCF-7ADR cells (Figure 1A). We determined possible miRNAs
capable of regulating PRKD1 by using microRNA prediction
online databases [miRanda (http://www.microrna.org/
microrna/home.do) and TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.
org/)]. Given that miR-34 was a candidate regulator,
we determined PRKD1 mRNA expression and protein
translation levels following ectopic expression of miR-34a,
miR-34b, and miR-34c. Although miR-34a, miR-34b, and
miR-34c have the same seed sequence, the results indicated

that PKD/PKCμ was downregulated only by miR-34a
(Figure 1B). To confirm the miR-34a binds to the PRKD1
3′-UTR, we mutated the predicted miR-34a binding site
on the PRKD1 3′-UTR and inserted the mutated sequence
into a pGL3-control vector (Figure 1C). As shown in Figure
1C, overexpression of miR-34a inhibited the luciferase
activity of the PRKD1 wild-type sequence, but not that
of the mutants in MCF-7-ADR cells. We screened for the
levels of miR-34a expression in breast cancer cell lines, and
consistent with the results shown in Figure 1A, miR-34a was
downregulated in MCF-7-ADR cells. These results indicate
that miR-34a negatively regulates PRKD1 (Figure 1A).
Expression levels of miR-34b and miR-34c were also
detected, however, no significant downregulation of either
variant in MCF-7-ADR cells was observed (Supplementary
Figure 1A, 1B). These results suggest that PRKD1 is
downregulated by miR-34a in MCF-7-ADR cell lines.

higher in MCF-7-ADR mammospheres compared with
MCF-7 mammospheres (Supplementary Figure 5A, 5B).
To investigate the effects of PRKD1 knockdown in breast
cancer stemness, we performed a Tumorsphere formation
assay. PRKD1 knockdown by miR-34a precursors and
PRKD1 siRNA significantly decreased the number of
tumorspheres (>70 μm) relative to controls (Figure 2D).
Additionally, the BCSC population was determined
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with
staining for the BCSC markers CD44+/CD24-. The
CD44+/CD24- population (Q1) was reduced by PRKD1
knockdown (Figure 2E). Collectively, PRKD1 was capable
of regulating cancer stemness in MCF-7-ADR cells by
altering GSK3/β-catenin signaling.

PRKD1 stimulates breast cancer stemness
through GSK3/β-catenin signaling

The processes associated with PKD/PKCμ
phosphorylation were identified as two possible
activation pathways: protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent
phosphorylation (Ser744/Ser748) and autophosphorylation
(Ser916). For full activation, autophosphorylation
should occur immediately following PKC-dependent
phosphorylation [10, 11]. CRT0066101 is an inhibitor
that targets PKD autophosphorylation [16]. To determine
the role of PKD/PKCμ autophosphorylation, MCF-7ADR cells were treated with 1 μM or 5 μM CRT0066101.
Western blotting revealed that CRT0066101 inhibited
phosphorylation of PKD/PKCμ and GSK3/β-catenin in
MCF-7-ADR cells (Figure 3A). However, GSK3/β-catenin
signaling was not influenced by CRT0066101 treatment in
MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 6A). The number of
tumorspheres (>70 μm) following CRT0066101 treatment
(1 μM or 5 μM) decreased in a dose-dependent manner
relative to the control (Figure 3B). As expected, the
CD44+/CD24- population (Q1) also decreased following
treatment with 1 μM CRT0066101 (Figure 3C). These
results indicated that regulation of breast cancer stemness
is necessary for PKD/PKCμ autophosphorylation through
GSK3/β-catenin signaling.

Inhibition of PKD/PKCμ phosphorylation
reduces BCSC self-renewal capacity

To determine the effects of PRKD1 inhibition
on CSCs, MCF-7-ADR cells were transfected with
miR-34a precursors and PRKD1 siRNAs. Following
transfection, miR-34a expression levels increased and
PKD/PKCμ levels decreased relative to negative control
(Figure 2A). PRKD1 expression levels also decreased
following PRKD1 siRNA transfection as compared to
levels observed in association with transfection of control
siRNA. Interestingly, PKD/PKCμ levels also decreased
following PRKD1 siRNA transfection (Figure 2B). We
checked efficiency of three different PRKD1 siRNAs to
exclude unspecific effects and we selected PRKD1 siRNA
#1, which was shown high suppression of PRKD1 relative
with the others (Supplementary Figure 2).
PRKD1 phosphorylation of β-catenin at Thr112/
Thr120 could be critical for cell-cell adhesion in prostate
cancer cells [20]. Furthermore, a complex of CDC42,
PAR6, and PKCζ binds GSK3β and catalyzes the
phosphorylation of Ser9 to inhibit GSK3β [21]. In order
to associate PRKD1 with GSK3/β-catenin signaling, we
performed western blot analysis. The results showed
that reduction of PKD/PKCμ suppressed β-catenin
expression and GSK3α and GSKβ phosphorylation
(Figure 2A). These results were confirmed in control and
PRKD1 siRNA-treated cells (Figure 2B). In addition,
we confirmed that miR-34a expression levels were
decreased by altering GSK3/β-catenin signaling following
transfection with miR-34a inhibitors in MCF-7 cells, as a
control (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B).
PRKD1 expression and GSK3/β-catenin signaling
were upregulated in MCF-7-ADR cells exhibiting
tumorsphere formation (Figure 2C). Cancer stemness
markers such as OCT4 and SOX2 were highly expressed in
MCF-7-ADR cells in sphere status (Supplementary Figure
4A, 4B). Furthermore, we also observed the expression
of miR-34a was lower and the expression of PRKD1 was

PRKD1 restores drug-resistance
Previous reports showed that PKD/PKCμ is
involved in apoptosis through caspase-3 inhibition [22].
Therefore, we determined whether PRKD1 inhibition
activates apoptosis in MCF-7-ADR cells, resulting in
further reduction in breast cancer stemness. As shown in
Figure 4A, exposure of MCF-7-ADR cells to doxorubicin
(DOX) resulted in decreased cell survival rates in a dosedependent manner. Importantly, PRKD1 knockdown
intensified the level of cell death as compared to control.
To determine whether decreased cell survival was due
to apoptosis, we measured casapase-3 activation. The
results indicated that PRKD1 inhibition resulted in
higher caspase-3 activity relative to control. Furthermore,

caspase-3 activity relative to control cells treated with
DOX (Figure 4B). Additionally, PRKD1 inhibition
by 0.1–5 μM CRT0066101 decreased cell-viability
percentages in a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7-ADR

cells (Figure 4C), but cell viability rate was not relevant to
treatment of CRT0066101 in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
Figure 6B). CRT0066101-treated cells combined with
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis decreased cell viability
to a greater degree than CRT0066101 treatment only

(Figure 4D). We also performed annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) staining to confirm that PRKD1 knockdown
or inhibition of PKD/PKCμ phosphorylation enhanced
apoptosis. The results showed that apoptosis initiation in
miR-34a-precursor-treated, PRKD1 siRNA-treated, and
DOX-treated cells increased relative to that in controls.

Interestingly, the apoptosis levels increased following
CRT0066101 treatment of DOX-treated cells (Figure 4E).
Together, these data indicated that downregulated PRKD1
or inhibition of PKD/PKCμ autophosphorylation restored
drug-resistance in MCF-7-ADR cells.

Interestingly, PRKD1 expression exhibits different pattern
in various cancer cell types and displays dual functions as
an oncogene or tumor suppressor [24]. PRKD1 expression
is downregulated in invasive human breast tumors
as compared with normal breast tissue [25]. Similar
expression patterns were confirmed by microarray analysis
and invasive cellular models, such as SK-BR-3, T-47D,
and MDA-MB-231 [25, 26]. Furthermore, reversion of
PRKD1 promoter methylation blocks breast cancer cell
invasion and metastasis [27]. Our results showed that
patterns of PRKD1 expression increased drug resistance in
MCF-7-ADR cell lines. PRKD1 was highly expressed in
drug resistance cell lines including doxorubicin-resistance
MCF-7-ADR cells, tamoxifen-resistance LCC2 cells,
and tamoxifen and fluvestrance resistance LCC9 cells
(data were not shown). Therefore, we conclude PRKD1
expression is associated with drug resistance properties.
We investigated the expression of miR-34a and PRKD1
in TCGA data sets (Supplementary Figure 7A). Since
PRKD1 is highly expressed in drug-resistance breast
cancer cells, we couldn’t find the inverse correlation
between miR-34a and PRKD1 expression in TCGA
DB. We further confirmed overall survival according to
level of PRKD1 expression in TCGA clinical data sets
(Supplementary Figure 7B). This graph represents patients
with high PRKD1 expression had poor survival than those
with low expression. Although we couldn’t confirmed
that inverse correlation between miR-34a and PRKD1
expression in whole breast cancer samples, we derived
PRKD1 expression correlates with worse prognosis of

would repress tumor growth via apoptosis, we performed
a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) assay. The results revealed that miR34a-overexpressed tumors contained higher numbers of
apoptotic cells as compared to control tumors (Figure 5C).
To further evaluate the effects of PKD/PKCμ functional
inhibition, we orally treated mice with established tumors
in xenograft models of MCF-7-ADR cells with a dose of 65
mg/kg CRT0066101 daily for 4 weeks. The size of tumors
in mice treated with CRT0066101 decreased relative to
untreated controls (Figure 5D). As expected, the weight of
tumors from mice treated with CRT0066101 decreased as
compared to that of control tumors. CRT0066101 treatment
didn’t cause side effects such as remarkable signs of toxicity
and loss of weight in all the animals. (Figure 5E). Moreover,
downregulation of phosphorylated PKD/PKCμ through
GSK3/β-catenin signaling was also confirmed by western
blot analysis (Figure 5F). Finally, we performed TUNEL
assay and Ki-67 staining to confirm CRT0066101 enhanced
apoptosis and repressed proliferation. The results indicated
that CRT0066101 treated tumors were increased apoptosis
and decreased proliferation relative to controls (Figure 5G).
Altogether, PKCμ inhibition by miR-34a or CRT0066101
contributed to reduction of tumor growth through apoptosis
initiation in vivo.

DISCUSSION
PRKD1 is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
cell adhesion, invasion, and vesicle trafficking [23].

breast cancer patients. Furthermore, we confirmed that
downregulated PRKD1 altered apoptosis signaling.
Therefore, we suggest that PRKD1 may be a potential
option for the restoration of drug sensitivity in breast
cancer cells.
The microRNA miR-34a plays a key role in
suppressing tumor. Previous studies reported that miR34a inhibits CSC function in various cancer types,
including prostate cancer [28], pancreatic cancer [29],
medulloblastomas [30], and glioblastomas [31]. This
molecule also suppresses targets associated with the cell
cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis, while inhibiting
cancer-cell viability, cancer stemness, metastasis, and
chemoresistance [17]. Here, we confirmed that miR34a negatively regulates PRKD1 in MCF-7-ADR cells.
Additionally, we found that PRKD1 is a novel target
of miR-34a through its binding to the PRKD1 3′-UTR.
Furthermore, we established that miR-34a-PRKD1
interactions play a critical role in overcoming cancer
stemness and drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines.
Prior studies reported that PRKD1 phosphorylates
β-catenin at Thr112/Thr120 and that PRKD1
overexpression resulted in suppression of β-cateninmediated transcriptional activity [32]. Phosphorylation
of β-catenin is occurs through GSK3, which targets
β-catenin as part of the Wnt-signaling protein complex
[33]. Furthermore, GSK3β is a kinase involved in
prostate cancer stemness and migration through a Wntindependent mechanism [34]. In our study, we observed
that downregulated PRKD1 led to suppression of the selfrenewal capacity of BCSCs through alteration of GSK3/
β-catenin signaling. Therefore, these results indicate that
PRKD1 activates breast cancer stemness through GSK3/βcatenin signaling.
Harikumar et al. discovered CRT0066101 as a
specific inhibitor of all PKD isoforms [16], showing
that CRT0066101 blocks pancreatic cancer growth by
inhibiting PRKD1 autophosphorylation [16]. Here,
we confirmed that PRKD1 activation was blocked by
CRT0066101 treatment of breast cancer cell lines and
xenograft models. These results provide the first evidence
that CRT0066101 may constitute a potential therapeutic
agent for breast cancer patients.
In this study, we showed that PRKD1 overexpression
in MCF-7-ADR cell lines was negatively correlated with
miR-34a overexpression. We confirmed miR-34a binding
to the PRKD1 3′-UTR, resulting in suppression of cancer
stemness in BCSCs through the GSK3/β-catenin signaling
pathway. Furthermore, we reported that CRT0066101, a
known PRKD1 inhibitor, influenced reductions in BCSC
population and drug resistance through the GSK3/βcatenin signaling pathway (Figure 6). Furthermore,
we observed that ectopic expression of miR-34a and
CRT0066101 treatment prevented tumor growth in
xenograft models. In conclusion, PRKD1 is negatively
regulated by miR-34a, leading to suppression of cancer

stemness and drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines.
These findings provide evidence that PRKD1 is a key
molecule that activates breast cancer stemness and drug
resistance, and promotes it as a potential therapeutic target
in breast cancer.

Chemicals and reagents
CRT0066101 was purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA); the drug was resuspended
in autoclaved distilled water for in vivo studies. For
CRT0066101 treatment, MCF-7-ADR cells (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were
seeded and 0.1–10 μM CRT0066101 was added,
followed by incubation for 1 h. WST-8 was purchased
from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Farmingdale, NY, USA).
PRKD1 siRNA and scrambled siRNA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were transfected
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA).

Cell culture and transfection
The human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7, MCF7-ADR, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (American Type
Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Welgene, Daejeon, South
Korea) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Welgene) and 1% penicillin streptomycin in a
37°C humidified incubator under 5% CO2. MCF-7-ADR
cells were seeded on 10-cm plates in media lacking
antibiotics in preparation for RNAi transfection. After 24
h, the cells were transfected with PRKD1 siRNA using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the
cells were collected for western blot analysis or were
resuspended in mammosphere medium. For microRNA
transfection, MCF-7-ADR cells were seeded for 48 h with
miRNA precursors (miR-34a/b/c) using siPORT NeoFX
Transfection Agent (Ambion; Thermo Fisher, St. Louis,
MO, USA). The miRNA precursors and negative-control
precursors were also obtained from Thermo Fisher.

Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR)
The qRT-PCR was performed using a RG3000
instrument (Corbett Robotics, San Francisco, CA, USA)
with the SYBR Green-based procedure according to
manufacturer instructions. The ABI-7500 instrument
(Thermo Fisher) was used to assess PRKD1 expression
in various breast-cancer cell lines. All oligonucleotide
primers were designed using DNASTAR (Madison,
WI, USA). All qRT-PCR graphs were obtained using
comparative Ct (ΔΔCt).

HEK293T cells. The seed sequences of miR-34 from
PRKD1 were mutated using PCR-based methods and
the reporter constructs were verified by sequencing.
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 3′UTR reporter constructs (1.5 μg/well in 6-well plates)
and 15 nM of miR-34 family precursors (Ambion), using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The activity of 3′-UTR
reporter constructs was normalized to the activity of the
cotransfected pCMV-hRL (40 ng/well in 6-well plates,
Promega). After a 24-h incubation, cells were lysed using
1× passive lysis buffer and activity was measured using
the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) according to
manufacturer instructions.

Paraffin sectioned slides from control or miR34a overexpressed tumors and vehicle or CRT0066101
treated tumors were used. Slides were deparaffinized and
rehydrated in Histoclear (3-4 times), then passed through
a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) in order.
Antigen retrieval was performed by dipping the sections
into 0.01M citric acid solution (pH6.0) and boiling in
the microwave for 15mins. In case of TUNEL assay,
In situ cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche,
Indianapolis, USA) labeled apoptotic positive cells and
Ki-67 primary antibody (Vector Lab, USA) was applied
onto the section, and it was incubated in 4°C overnight.
Then, the slides were incubated with DAPI and secondary
antibody for 2h. Finally, mounted with mounting solution
(Dako) and images were captured with a confocal
microscope (Zeiss).

Tumorsphere formation assay (TSA)

Preparation of breast cancer xenografted mice

For the tumorsphere culture, cells (2000 cells/
mL) were cultured in suspension in serum-free DMEM/
F12 (welGENE) supplemented with 1% penicillin, B27
(1:50; Gibco; Thermo Fisher), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth
factor (Prospec, East Brunswick, NJ, USA), 5 mg/mL
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 0.4%
bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). After ~10 days,
plates were analyzed for tumorsphere formation and were
quantified using a microscope (Olympus IX71; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). For counting tumorspheres, MCF-7ADR cells were filtered through a 70-μm pore strainer
(BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) and then
quantified. CRT0066101 treatment was administered at
culture days 6 and 8.

All studies involving the use of nude mice were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Yonsei University Medical School (2015-0087) and
performed in specific pathogen-free facilities and under
conditions in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of YUMS. Mice were
inoculated subcutaneously with 1.5x106 MCF-7-ADR
cells into each flank under 150 μL of saline/zoletil/rompun
(7:1:1) anesthesia. Mice were randomized into groups (n =
6 per group), and treatment was started 10 days after tumor
implantation. CRT0066101 was administered to tumorbearing animals orally, five times a week for 4 weeks at
dose of 1.6mg/kg. From palpable tumor formation until
termination, tumor sizes were measured every 3 to 4 days
using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated with
the following formula: length × width2 × 0.5236. Mice
were sacrificed in a 7.5% CO2 chamber, and tumors were
harvested for immunohistochemistry and other analyses.
