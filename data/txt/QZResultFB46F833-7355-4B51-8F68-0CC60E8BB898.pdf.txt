ABSTRACT
MicroRNA contribute to tumor radiation resistance, which is an important
clinical problem, and thus we are interested in identifying and characterizing their
function. We demonstrate that miR-620 contributes to radiation resistance in cancer
cells by increasing proliferation, and decreasing the G2/M block. We identify the
hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)
(HPGD/15-PGDH) tumor suppressor gene as a direct miR-620 target, which results
in increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Furthermore, we show that siRNA
targeting of HPGD or administration of exogenous PGE2 recapitulates radioresistance.
Targeting of the EP2 receptor that responds to PGE2 using pharmacological or genetic
approaches, abrogates radioresistance. Tumor xenograft experiments confirm that
miR-620 increases proliferation and tumor radioresistance in vivo. Regulation of PGE2
levels via targeting of HPGD by miR-620 is an innovative manner by which a microRNA
can induce radiation resistance.

multiple target mRNA. Their expression is known to be
dysregulated in malignancies, and they are believed to
contribute towards the pathogenesis of cancer [5]. Indeed,
they can influence a broad range of cancer-related processes
including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis.
It is now known that miR are involved in the response of
tumor cells to radiotherapy (reviewed in [6] and [7]). Frank
Slack and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that miR
from the let-7 family could directly influence radiosensitivity
in C. elegans and cancer cells [8]. Dicer and Drosha, which
are essential enzymes involved in processing miR, are now
known to be involved in activation of the DNA damage
response (DDR) [9], further supporting the importance of
miR in mediating cellular response to ionizing radiation.
miR have been demonstrated to regulate radiosensitivity
through targeting essential components of the DDR such as

INTRODUCTION
Over 50% of cancer patients will receive radiotherapy
as part of their treatment. Despite delivery of a radical course
of radiotherapy, tumor recurrences can occur, due to cellular
mediators that promote radiation resistance [1], and this, in
turn, can result in a more aggressive phenotype including
increased proliferative capacity, nodal metastases, and poor
prognosis [2–4]. To address this important clinical problem, a
better understanding of the molecular mediators of resistance
is required. We investigate the role of microRNA (miR) as
mediators of tumor aggression and radiation resistance.
miR are short non-coding RNA that bind to the 3′
untranslated (UTR) region of mRNA, resulting in transcript
degradation or inhibition of protein translation. A single
miR may exhibit pleotropic effects due to regulation of

protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) [11], histone
variant H2AX [12], SNF2H [13], and the p53 (reviewed in
[14]), and BRCA1 tumor suppressors [15]. Additionally, miR
target critical survival pathways, such as the Akt [16, 17],
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and sphingosinephosphate 1 (S1P) signaling pathways [18]. Collectively,
this results in alteration of cellular radiosensitivity.
However, there are many additional miR that may influence
radiosensitivity and these remain to be characterized.
We have now investigated the function of miR-620 in
cancer radiation resistance and aggression. Only one paper
has investigated the role of miR-620 to date [19]. Zhao
et al., recently demonstrated that miR-620 is upregulated
in human lung adenocarcinoma, and targets the Glypican 5
(GPC5) tumor suppressor gene, which alters proliferation,
migration and invasion [19]. We now demonstrate that miR620 overexpression promotes a radioresistant phenotype in
a range of cancer cells, increases cellular proliferation and
deregulates the G2/M checkpoint following irradiation,
and enhances invasiveness. We discovered that miR-620
directly targets the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase
15-(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (HPGD/15PGDH) tumor suppressor gene. HPGD is a key enzyme that
inactivates prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a proinflammatory
lipid which promotes tumorigenesis [20, 21]. We show
for the first time that miR-620 downregulation of HPGD
promotes radioresistance. Additionally, we demonstrate that
PGE2 administration can induce cancer cell radioresistance,
and that knockdown of the EP2 receptor or pharmacological
inhibition with an EP2 antagonist can abrogate this.
Together, our research provides novel insights into
the role of miR-620 in promotion of cancer aggression and
radiation resistance, and highlights the relevance of PGE2
in radiation response.

different cancer cell types. To determine if this resistance
was due to an influence on cellular proliferation, we mock
irradiated and irradiated MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells
that were transiently transfected with miR-620 mimic or
control mimic and counted viable cells. miR-620 did not
significantly alter proliferation of mock irradiated MDAMB-231 (1.1 ± 0.1 (miR-620) versus 1.0 (control), p = ns) or
DU145 cells (1.1 ± 0.2 (miR-620) versus 1.0 (control), ns).
However, it significantly increased proliferation following a
6 Gy dose of ionizing radiation (IR), relative to control cells
(MDA-MB-231: 1.2 ± 0.1 (miR-620) versus 1.0 (control); p
< 0.05 and DU145: 1.7 ± 0.2 (miR-620) versus 1.0 (control),
p < 0.05) (Figure 2A). Consistent with this, we discovered
that the cell cycle profiles of MDA-MB-231 (G1 phase:
76.6 ± 2.2% (miR-620) versus 80.3% ± 3.2% (control), ns;
S phase: 8.1 ± 3.6% (miR-620) versus 5.7 ± 2.5% (control),
ns; G2/M phase: 15.2 ± 0.2% (miR-620) versus 13.8 ± 2.0%
(control), ns) and DU145 cells (G1 phase: 66.9 ± 1.5% (miR620) versus 68.1 ± 3.1% (control), ns; S phase: 8.6 ± 1.6%
(miR-620) versus 7.8 ± 1.8% (control), ns; G2/M phase:
24.5 ± 2.6% (miR-620) versus 23.9 ± 2.5% (control), ns)
were not altered by miR-620 mimic in mock irradiated cells.
However, 24 h after IR, the control MDA-MB-231 (G2/M
phase: 48.4 ± 1.4% (miR-620) versus 54.0 ± 2.2% (control),
p < 0.05) and DU145 cells (G2/M phase: 38.6 ± 8.6% (miR620) versus 51.3 ± 8.9% (control), p < 0.01) demonstrated an
accumulation of cells in G2/M, which was significantly less
in miR-620 transfected cells (Figure 2B). The extent of G2/M
deregulation was lower in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to
DU145 cells, however. Thus, increased expression of miR-620
induces radioresistance, increases proliferative capacity and
deregulation of the G2/M checkpoint following irradiation.

miR-620 increases cellular invasiveness
Increased invasiveness may promote metastatic
spread, and thus we assessed the influence of miR-620
on invasion using the Matrigel transwell assay. miR-620
overexpression significantly increased the invasiveness
of MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells (1.7 ± 0.2 (miR-620)
versus 1.0 (control); p < 0.05) and DU145 cells (2.2 ±
0.15 (miR-620) versus 1.0 (control); p < 0.05) (Figure 3).
Collectively, miR-620 can promote an aggressive
phenotype in both MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells by
increasing survival and proliferation following radiation
treatment, and enhancing invasive capacity.

RESULTS
miR-620 promotes increased survival,
proliferation and G2/M checkpoint deregulation
following irradiation
It is becoming evident that miR play an important
role in tumor radiation response. We assessed the influence
of a recently characterized miR-miR-620 (described in only
one publication to date [19]), on cancer radiation response
by transiently transfecting breast, prostate and pancreatic
cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, nontumorigenic MCF10A breast cells, 22RV1 and DU145
prostate cancer cells, PSN-1 and MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic
cancer cells) with a miR-620 mimic or a control mimic and
performing radiation clonogenic survival assays. All miR620 mimic transfected cell lines displayed increased radiation
resistance compared to control mimic transfected cells (as
indicated with increased radiation protection factors (RPF) in
Figure 1), demonstrating that this effect is conserved between

radiation resistance
To identify downstream effectors of miR-620
potentially mediating radioresistance, we performed in
silico target prediction using Targetscan Human release
6.0 [22]. Targetscan identified the tumor suppressor gene,
hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide) (HPGD/15-PGDH) as a putative

target of miR-620. HPGD is the key enzyme that
inactivates a number of bioactive lipids, and is also a
tumor suppressor [20]; its expression is reduced in a
range of human cancers relative to corresponding normal
tissue [23, 24 , 25]. HPGD catalyzes the degradation of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a bioactive eicosanoid that is
associated with tumor progression [26, 27]. Its substrate,
PGE2, has been previously demonstrated to provide
radioprotection for normal intestinal stem cells [28–30].
Thus, we were interested in determining whether miR620 targets HPGD, thereby increasing levels of PGE2 to
promote radioresistance.
Western blotting of lysates from MDA-MB-231 and
DU145 cells transfected with control or miR-620 mimic
established that HPGD was decreased at the protein level
(Figure 4A). We co-transfected a luciferase reporter vector
bearing the wildtype 3′UTR of HPGD into MDA-MB-231
or DU145 cells with control or miR-620 mimic. The
presence of miR-620 resulted in a significant reduction in
normalized luciferase units relative to control (MDA- MB231: 0.72 ± 0.03, p < 0.05; DU145: 0.83 ± 0.03, p < 0.05)
(Figure 4B). However, mutation of the predicted miR620 binding site reconstituted luciferase activity with no
significant difference relative to control (MDA-MB-231:
0.92 ± 0.04; DU145: 1.03 ± 0.01) (Figure 4B).
We next assayed cellular PGE2 levels (the key
substrate for HPGD), and discovered that miR-620 mimic
transfected cells have higher levels of PGE2 compared
to control cells (MDA-MB-231: 29.8 ± 2.1 (miR-620)
versus 16.0 ± 1.3 (control); p < 0.001; DU145: 38.4 ±
1.2 (miR-620) versus 29.7 ± 1.6 (control); p < 0.01)
(Figure 4C). Similarly, knockdown of HPGD with
siRNA increased PGE2 levels (MDA-MB-231: 62.7
± 4.6 (HPGD siRNA) versus 20.4 ± 1.7 (control); p <
0.001; DU145: 19.4 ± 2.8 (HPGD siRNA) versus 13.2
± 1.6 (control); p < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Knockdown of
HPGD increased radiation resistance in both MDAMB-231 and DU145 cells (Figure 4D); reduction of
HPGD protein levels were confirmed by western blotting
(Supplementary Figure 1). For MDA-MB-231 cells,
RPFs were similar between HPGD knockdown compared
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to miR-620 overexpression. However, for DU145 cells,
HPGD knockdown resulted in a slightly lower RPF
compared to miR-620 overexpression. Together, this
demonstrated that HPGD knockdown could phenocopy
the radioresistance seen in miR-620 overexpressing cells.
Similarly, treatment with exogenous PGE2 rendered cells
more resistant to radiation (MDA-MB-231: 0.097 ± 0.003
(PGE2) versus 0.041 ± 0.003 (vehicle); p < 0.001; DU145:
0.056 ± 0.004 (PGE2) versus 0.033 ± 0.002 (vehicle);
p < 0.01) (Figure 4E). PGE2 signaling occurs through E
Prostanoid (EP) receptors, and the EP2 receptor has been
demonstrated to mediate radiosensitivity of normal small
intestinal crypt cells [30]. Thus to determine whether the
EP2 receptor was responsible for the observed radiation
resistance induced by miR-620, we used siRNA to
knockdown the EP2 receptor (Supplementary Figure 2)
and performed radiation clonogenic survival assays in
MDA-MB-231 cells stably overexpressing miR-620 or
control miR (Figure 5). Knockdown of the EP2 receptor
promoted cancer cell radiosensitivity to a greater degree
in the miR-620 overexpressing cells relative to control
cells. Similarly, pharmacological antagonism of the EP2
receptor with AH-6809 was able to radiosensitize MDAMB-231 cells stably overexpressing control and miR620, with greater sensitization seen again in the miR-620
overexpressing cells (Figure 5). This indicated that the
EP2 receptor is an important intermediary for miR-620mediated radiation resistance.

subcutaneous tumors in athymic nude mice, followed
by irradiation of the tumors with an 8 Gy dose of
IR or mock IR (Figure 6A). The mock irradiated

tumor volumes based upon day 39 values, p < 0.05)
(Figure 6A). This provided in vivo evidence that miR620 overexpression renders tumor radioresistant.

essential to understanding this clinical problem. We
provide novel evidence that miR-620 can promote
radiation resistance in a range of cancer cells, including
those that are inherently more radioresistant (i.e.,
pancreatic cancer). Our research provides the first
link between miR regulation of PGE2 and radiation
resistance, which occurs through alteration of PGE2
levels via targeting of HPGD.
PGE2 can induce pleotropic tumorigenic effects
that include enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion,
and angiogenesis [31–33]. Signaling by PGE2 occurs
through four EP receptors, and their expression levels

are altered in cancer [34]. Additionally, since they are
coupled to different signaling pathways, their phenotypic
outcome (e.g., tumor progression or inhibition) can differ.
Expression of EP2 and EP4 receptors are elevated in
prostate cancer specimens compared to non-malignant
prostate [35, 36]. EP4 expression increases during
progression of prostate cancer from an androgen-sensitive
state to castrate-resistance [37], highlighting the distinct
phenotypic effects that these receptors can possess. The
use of aspirin (which inhibits cyclo-oxygenase 1 (COX1) and 2 (COX-2) production) has been associated with a
reduction in prostate cancer specific mortality in patients
treated with radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy [38].
Mechanistically, it has been demonstrated that the COX2 inhibitor, celecoxib, induces prostate cancer death
through the EP2 receptor [39]. In a murine model of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) driven mammary cancer, the EP1,
EP2, and EP4 receptors were upregulated in tumor tissue
[40]. Treatment of these tumors with celecoxib reduced
tumor growth and reduced microvessel density [40].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Similarly, Tian and Schiemann observed that loss of EP2
receptor reduced breast cancer growth, angiogenesis, and
metastases in an orthotopic mouse model [41].
Accumulating evidence in the literature supports the
overarching view that mechanisms resulting in increased
production and signaling from PGE2 promotes tumor
therapy resistance. Kurtova et al. recently reported that
chemotherapy can induce PGE2 release in bladder cancer,
and that this promotes cancer stem cell (CSC) repopulation
and treatment resistance [42]. They noted that the CSC
repopulation was blocked by a PGE2-neutralizing antibody
and celecoxib-mediated blockade of PGE2 signalling.
Although we have not specifically assayed for miR-620 and
HPGD effects on CSC frequency in our cancer cell models, it
is clear that miR-620 overexpression, HPGD knockdown or
PGE2 treatment can increase clonogenic survival following
irradiation. Clonogenic survival is the gold standard assay
for irradiation studies, and takes into account all modes of
cell death following irradiation including mitotic catastrophe,
terminal senescence, apoptosis and presumably the influence

Figure 7: Proposed model of miR-620 on cancer survival in response to radiation treatment. PGE2 is synthesized through

the action of COX1 and COX2 on arachidonic acid, followed by PGE synthase. This is counteracted by degradation of PGE2 by its major
catabolizing enzyme, HPGD. miR-620 specifically targets HPGD for degradation which results in increased PGE2 levels, and signaling
through the EP2 receptor promotes cancer cell survival.

of CSC repopulation. The Li laboratory demonstrated that
in irradiated tumors, activation of caspase 3 by apoptotic
tumor cells induces PGE2, which can stimulate the growth
of surviving tumor cells to repopulate the tumor [43]. PGE2
appears to have a conserved effect in radiation response,
since it increases hematopoietic stem cell survival after total
body irradiation [44].
PGE2 has been shown to promote prostate cancer
proliferation [39], and angiogenesis (via VEGF secretion) and
this also appears to be mediated primarily by the EP2 receptor
[32, 33]. We have now demonstrated that the EP2 receptor is
also important for promotion of radiation resistance by miR620, as its genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition can
radiosensitize cancer cells that overexpress miR-620. Thus,
our research adds to the importance of the EP2 receptor in
tumor progression and aggression, by demonstrating its role
in promotion of cancer cell survival following irradiation.
Together, our results provide support for a model whereby
miR-620 targets HPGD, resulting in accumulation of
HPGD’s substrate, PGE2, and signaling by PGE2 through the
EP2 receptor results in cancer radiation resistance (Figure 7).
Mohamed et al. demonstrated that elevated levels of the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein found in prostate cancer,
can decrease HPGD expression by binding to the HPGD
promoter, resulting in PGE2-dependent cancer proliferation
and invasion [45]. However, epigenetic mechanisms also play
an important role in regulation of HPGD expression. Thiel et
al., discovered that HPGD expression is downregulated in
gastric cancer, and provided evidence that this occurred partly
through promoter methylation [24]. Our findings indicate
that miR-targeting is another epigenetic mechanism that can
regulate HPGD expression. Indeed, Lu and colleagues also
recently demonstrated that HPGD is decreased by miR-21,
and that increased PGE2 promotes cholangiocarcinoma
growth [46]. In addition to regulation of PGE2 degradation
by HPGD, it is known that the generation of PGE2 is also
tightly regulated.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the
synthesis of prostaglandins from arachindonic acid, and is a
rate-limiting enzyme in PGE2 production. Not surprisingly,
COX-2 induction is associated with increased production
of PGE2 [47]. Analysis of data from the Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group (RTOG)-9202 trial which randomized
men with prostate cancer to short or long term androgendeprivation therapy, demonstrated that COX-2 expression
was associated with biochemical failure and distant metastasis
[48]. A more recent analysis of this trial data indicated that
high expression of COX-2 in prostate cancer, in combination
with three other genes (ki-67, MDM2 and p16), predicted for
an increased risk of developing distant metastases following
androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy [49]. In
addition to its utility as a prognostic biomarker, research
has also investigated COX-2 as a therapeutic target [50].
Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated proof-ofprinciple of COX-2 inhibition for enhancement of tumor
radiation response (reviewed in [51]). Several early phase
trials are investigating the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, as a
radiosensitizer in a range of malignancies including prostate
cancer [52], locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
[53], locally advanced cervical cancer [54], rectal cancer,
and recurrent head and neck cancer [55]. The acute toxicities
have generally been well-tolerated, although Herrera et al.
reported higher than expected late complications [54]. COX-2
inhibitors are also known to increase the risk of cardiovascular
events in patients [56], and thus this may limit their utility as
tumor radiosensitizers. We demonstrated that specific blockade
of the EP2 receptor has therapeutic efficacy in reversing
radioresistance, and thus the use of specific inhibitors of PGE2
signaling such as EP2 antagonists may be desirable, since they
may potentially limit or avoid side-effects seen with COX-2
inhibitors. Nevertheless, future investigations are needed to
establish the potential radiosensitization of critical normal
tissues (e.g., small intestine, spinal cord) by EP2 antagonists,
and thereby allow determination of the therapeutic ratio.

EP2 receptor antagonist

The post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2
by different miR has been well described by multiple
research groups (reviewed in [57]). In this context, these
miR would presumably exhibit a tumor inhibiting function
by downregulating PGE2 production. Our research adds a
new element of complexity, by demonstrating for the first
time, that miR-620 can target the major PGE2 catabolizing
enzyme, HPGD, and promote tumor radiation resistance.
Additionally, we provide evidence that pharmacological
antagonism of the EP2 receptor may be a useful
therapeutic strategy to enhance tumor radiation response.

pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MIAPaCa-2, PSN-1) cell lines
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC; VA, USA). Early passage cell lines were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with the
exception of PSN-1 which were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium, containing 4.5 g/L glucose (Invitrogen, Ontario,
Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Invitrogen, Ontario, Canada) and penicillin (100 U/mL) –
streptomycin (100 μg/mL) (Invitrogen, Ontario, Canada)
(hereafter referred to as 10% DMEM), and maintained
in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. MCF10A
immortalized human mammary epithelial cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Senthil Muthuswamy, and cultured in
DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen,
Ontario, Canada), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (20 ng/mL),
(Sigma-Aldrich, Ontario, Canada) hydrocortisone (0.5
mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Ontario, Canada), cholera toxin
(100 ng/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Ontario, Canada), insulin
(10 ug/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Ontario, Canada) and penicillinstreptomycin. Cell lines were passaged when they reached
approximately 80% confluency and were regularly tested
with MycoAlert (Lonza, Ontario, Canada) to ensure the
absence of mycoplasma contamination.

24 h after transient transfection of cells with miR620 or control mimic, cells were seeded in triplicate in
10% DMEM in 6-well plates and mock irradiated or
irradiated with a 6 Gy dose of IR 6 hr later. Four days
later, cells were trypsinized and total viable cell number
determined using the Countess automated cell counter
(Life Technologies, Ontario, Canada); cell numbers were
normalized relative to control cells.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were mock irradiated or irradiated with a 6 Gy
dose of IR, then 24 h later, cells were trypsinized, washed in
PBS and fixed in ice-cold 80% ethanol in Hank’s Buffered
Salt Solution (HBSS) (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.25
mM Na2HPO4, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM
MgSO4, 4.2 mM NaHCO3) for 30 min on ice. Fixed cells
were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS,
and resuspended in 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (SigmaAldrich, Ontario, Canada) with 0.6% NP-40 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, IL, USA) and 0.1 mg/mL RNAse A in HBSS for
30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then
collected by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and 20, 000
events captured on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, Ontario, Canada) and cell cycle profile
analyzed using FlowJo 10.0.4 (Tree Star Inc., OR, USA).

Transfection of microRNA mimics and siRNA

Radiation clonogenic survival assay

3 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well plates, then
16 h later, miScript miRNA miR-620 mimic or miRNA
control mimic (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) were
mixed with 6 μL of DharmaFECT transfection reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and DMEM as per
the manufacturer’s instructions, then added to 10% DMEM
for transfection of the cells. For siRNA transfections,
control and siRNA for HPGD or EP2 receptor (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA) were transiently transfected
into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Ontario,
Canada) as per manufacturer’s recommendations, and 24 h
later, radiation clonogenic survival assays (described below)
were performed on the transfected cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were seeded onto a six-well plate in 10% DMEM
in triplicate and mock irradiated (0 Gy) or irradiated with 2, 4,
or 6 Gy dose of IR, respectively. Then cells were placed in a
humidified CO2 incubator at 37oC to allow colonies to form.
Colonies were stained with crystal violet staining solution
(0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Ontario, Canada), 25%
methanol) and counted. Survival was expressed as the relative
plating efficiencies of the treated cells compared with that of
the mock-irradiated cells. The experiments were performed
three separate times. Radiation dose-response curves were
created by fitting the data to the linear-quadratic equation
S = e-αD−βD2 using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software
22447

Oncotarget

Inc, CA, USA), where S is the surviving fraction, α and β are
inactivation constants, and D is the dose in Gy. The area under
the curves (AUC) which represent the mean inactivation dose
(MID) were also calculated using GraphPad Prism. The
radiation protection factor (RPF) was calculated by dividing
the MID of the test cells by the MID of control cells.

25 μg of lysate was loaded per lane and proteins resolved
by 4%–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, wet-transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (EMD Millipore, MA,
USA), and the membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat
dry milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) (10
mM Tris-Base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20; pH 7.4)
for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific antibody
binding, followed by incubation with primary antibody in
5% milk in TBST overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation.
The membranes were washed three times for 10 min each
in TBST, then incubated in TBST at room temperature for
1 h, followed by three 10-min washes with TBST. Proteinantibody binding on the membranes was detected with the
use of enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus solution
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Quebec, Canada) followed
by exposure of the membranes to x-ray film (FujiFilm,
Ontario, Canada). Anti-HPGD antibody was purchased
from Sino Biological, China. Anti-β-actin antibody was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA.

Real-time quantitative PCR
For microRNA expression, total microRNA was
extracted from cells or tumors using the mirVana miRNA kit
(Invitrogen, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the miScript II
RT kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. The mature miR-620 expression level was
quantified through quantitative real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) and
miScript Primer Assay for SNORD61 and miR-620 (Qiagen,
Ontario, Canada) on the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR system
(Life Technologies, Ontario, Canada). For gene expression,
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen,
Ontario, Canada) and cDNA synthesized using Omniscript
RT kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. HPGD expression level was quantified through
quantitative real-time PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green
PCR kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada) on the StepOnePlus Realtime PCR system. For both microRNA and mRNA, expression
levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method via
StepOne Software (Life Technologies, Ontario, Canada),
and relative expression levels normalized to SNORD61 (for
microRNA) or GAPDH (for mRNA)). Primer sequences:
HPGD: forward 5′-TGCTTCAAAGCATGGCATAG-3′,
reverse 5′-AACAAAGCCTGGACAAATGG-3′.

Luciferase assay
For HPGD 3′UTR luciferase assays, cells were
transiently co-transfected with a HPGD 3′UTR luciferase
reporter plasmid or HPGD 3′UTR luciferase reporter
plasmid with mutations in the predicted miR-620 binding
site, pcDNA3 vector constitutively expressing Renilla
luciferase, and miScript miRNA miR-620 mimic or
control mimic. 24 h later, cells were processed for firefly
luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual
Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, WI, USA). To
normalize for transfection efficiency, the firefly luciferase
activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity.

Matrigel transwell invasion assay

PGE-2 assay

Cells were serum starved overnight (0.1% DMEM),
then 2 × 105 cells were seeded on top of 8 μm transwell
inserts (BD Biosciences, Ontario, Canada) with 0.1%
DMEM and pre-coated with Matrigel (Becton, Dickinson
and Company, Ontario, Canada); 10% DMEM was used as a
chemoattractant. After 24 h, cells that had invaded through the
Matrigel coated transwell inserts were fixed, stained by KwikDiff Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ontario, Canada) and
number of invading cells counted under 10 × using a Leica
DM LB2 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Ontario, Canada).

Cells were lysed in homogenization buffer, lysates
sonicated, and processed through a QIA Shredder
(Qiagen, Ontario, Canada). Lysate was then clarified by
centrifugation, total protein concentrations determined,
and PGE2 levels assayed using the Prosaglandin E2 EIA
kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Michiagan, USA) as per
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Tumor xenograft experiments
All experiments involving mice were performed
according to University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Research
Institute guidelines, using a peer-reviewed animal protocol.
Three million DU145-control and DU145-miR-620 cells
were mixed in a 1:1 (vol:vol) ratio with Growth Factor
Reduced Matrigel (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Ontario,
Canada), and the mixture was injected subcutaneously into
the right flanks of 6 to 7-week-old female athymic nude mice
(Harlan, Ontario, Canada). Tumor volume (in mm3) was
determined by caliper measurements performed every 3 to
4 days and calculated by using the modified ellipse formula

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoassay
precipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% (v/v)
Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Quebec, Canada)). Cell debris and insoluble
material were removed by centrifugation at 12, 000 g
at 4oC for 20 min. Following protein quantitation using
the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Ontario, Canada),

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

(volume = length × width2/2). When the xenograft tumor
volumes reached approximately 100 mm3, mice were
randomly assigned to mock IR or an 8 Gy dose of IR
delivered to the tumor, and tumor volumes determined every
3–4 days after IR. When tumor volumes reached three times
the starting volume (except for DU145-control irradiated
tumors; these tumors were harvested at day 48), the mice
were killed by cervical dislocation, and their tumors were
excised, cut in half, with one half placed in Tissue-Tek O.C.T.
compound (Fisher Scientific Co., Ottawa, Ontario) and stored
at −80°C until cryosectioning and the remaining half flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen.

The authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.

To quantitate tumor necrosis, cellular proliferation
and angiogenesis, five micron thick tumor sections
were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E),
anti-Ki-67 or anti-CD31 antibodies respectively (n = 3
tumors per group) as previously described [58]. Areas of
necrosis were delineated, quantitated and expressed as a
percentage of total tumor area. The percentage of Ki-67
positive nuclei were quantitated from 6 representative
fields. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by
finding tumor areas with the highest vascularity (hot
spots) on low magnification (5×), and in each hot spot,
CD31 positive microvessels were counted under high
magnification (20×), with a positive microvessel defined
as an endothelial cell or endothelial cell cluster that was
clearly separated from adjacent microvessels, tumor cells,
and other connective tissue elements.
