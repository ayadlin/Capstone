BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use has been associated with a decreased
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the effects of NSAID on clinical outcomes after CRC diagnosis are not well defined. The authors investigated the association between
prediagnosis NSAID use and mortality after CRC diagnosis among women in the California Teachers Study
cohort. METHODS: Women aged <85 years participating in the California Teachers Study, without a prior
CRC diagnosis at baseline (1995-1996), and who were diagnosed with CRC during follow-up through December 2005, were eligible for analysis of the association between prediagnosis NSAID use and mortality.
NSAID use (including aspirin and ibuprofen) was collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Cancer occurrence was identified through California Cancer Registry linkage. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression models were used to estimate hazards ratios (HR) for death and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Among 621 CRC patients who were identified, 64% reported no prediagnosis regular NSAID use, 17% reported use of 1 to 6 days/week, and 20% reported daily use. A duration of NSAID
use <5 years was reported by 17% of patients and a use of 5 years was reported by 18%. Regular prediagnosis NSAID use (1-3 days/week, 4-6 days/week, and daily) versus none was associated with improved
overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.95) and CRC-specific survival (HR, 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.84)
after adjustment for clinically relevant factors. Prediagnosis NSAID use 5 years (vs none) was found to be
associated with improved OS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.84) and CRC-specific survival (HR, 0.40; 95% CI,
0.23-0.71) in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: When used regularly or over a prolonged duration before
CRC diagnosis, NSAIDs are associated with decreased mortality among female CRC patients. Cancer

NSAIDs and Mortality After CRC Diagnosis/Zell et al

During the year 2007, an estimated 112,340 new
cases of colon cancer and 41,420 cases of rectal cancer
were diagnosed in the United States, making colorectal
cancer (CRC) the third most common cancer among
US men and women.1 A wide body of evidence links
use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
to a reduced risk of CRC. First, rodent models have
demonstrated that NSAIDs inhibit intestinal cancer development.2-8 Consistent with experimental data, clinical trial results involving patients with familial
adenomatous polyposis have demonstrated that the
NSAIDs sulindac,9-11 celecoxib,12 and rofecoxib13 prevent colorectal adenomas. Aspirin has been implicated
in the regression and prevention of premalignant colorectal adenomas in clinical trials,14,15 and various
NSAIDs have been associated with a reduced risk of
CRC in the vast majority of cohort and case-control
studies.16-23 In addition to these studies demonstrating
preventive effects on CRC risk, 2 important studies suggest that NSAID use after a diagnosis of CRC may
improve survival.24,25 In the male Health Professionals
Study, for example, aspirin was associated with a
decreased risk of CRC or adenoma, and also with a
decreased risk of advanced stage CRC and fatal CRC.24
However, to our knowledge, these reports are limited to
a cohort study of males, and an unpublished, secondary
analysis of clinical trial data restricted to stage III colon
cancer patients. Survival outcomes from key therapeutic
trials involving NSAIDs among CRC patients have not
to our knowledge been reported to date. Thus, a clear
determination of potential survival benefits associated
with NSAID use after CRC diagnosis has not been
established. By using data from women in the California Teachers Study (CTS) cohort, we investigated the
correlation between NSAIDs and mortality among
CRC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The CTS is a prospective cohort of current, recent, and
retired female public school teachers and administrators
who were members of the California State Teachers Retirement System at the time of study inception in 1995.26
Cohort members completed a detailed self-administered
Cancer

baseline questionnaire. A total of 133,479 women comprise
the CTS cohort. The CTS has been approved by the institutional review boards of the State of California, the University of Southern California, the University of California
at Irvine, the Northern California Cancer Center, and the
City of Hope National Medical Center.
To identify incident invasive colorectal cancers that
occurred during follow-up of the CTS, we first delineated
a cohort of eligible women. We excluded in a hierarchical
manner women who 1) moved out of the state or whose
history of invasive cancer during the follow-up period was
unknown (n ¼ 10,443), 2) were aged >85 years at baseline (n ¼ 1674), 3) had developed a prior malignancy (n
¼ 169); 4) lacked data regarding family history of CRC
(n ¼ 3844), and 5) lacked data concerning the frequency
of NSAID use (n ¼ 3106). The resulting cohort was comprised of 114,243 women.
Case Ascertainment and Follow-Up
Incident diagnoses of invasive carcinoma of the colon and
rectum (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology [ICD-O] topography codes C18.0-18.9, C19.9,
and C20.9) were identified through annual linkages with
the California Cancer Registry. The California Cancer
Registry also provided details regarding anatomic subsite
within the colorectum and extent of disease. As part of a
state mandate for cancer reporting, the California Cancer
Registry receives reports on >99% of all cancer diagnoses
occurring in California residents.27 Overall, 621 CTS participants considered eligible for analysis were diagnosed
with invasive colorectal carcinoma during follow-up: 427
with colon cancer, 173 with rectal cancer, and 21 with
large bowel cancer of unspecified site.
Follow-up was calculated from the date of diagnosis
of colorectal cancer to death, or the end of the follow-up
period on December 31, 2005. Treatment during the first
course of therapy was ascertained using available California Cancer Registry data describing receipt of surgical
resection and/or radiotherapy. Cause of death was
recorded according to the ICD-O criteria in effect at the
time of death.28
Assessment of Medication Use
The self-administered questionnaire asked ‘‘Have you
taken any of the following medications regularly (at least
5663

Original Article

once a week)?’’ Available options included 1) aspirin
(Anacin, Bufferin, or Excedrin) or 2) ibuprofen (Advil,
Motrin, or Nuprin). For positive responses, participants
indicated the average number of days per week (frequency) (1-3, 4-6, or 7) and the total duration of use in
number of years (<1, 1, 2, 3-4, 5-9, or 10). For the primary analyses, frequency of medication use was categorized into 2 categories: no use or regular use (1-3 days per
week, 4-6 days per week, or daily use). Duration was categorized as no use, duration <5 years, or duration 5
years. The reconstituted NSAID variables in the CTS
were used for all analyses, because these accounted for
combinations of aspirin and ibuprofen use.

Assessment of CRC Risk Factors
Family history of CRC was defined as having a firstdegree relative diagnosed with CRC (parent, sibling, or
child). Information regarding other potential CRC risk
factors was collected in the baseline questionnaire, including race/ethnicity; personal history or family history of
colorectal polyps; body mass index (BMI); recreational
physical activity; lifetime tobacco exposure; oral contraceptive use; hormone replacement use; years since last
mammogram or Papanicolaou smear; and total daily
intake of calcium, folate, fiber, iron, and energy (in
kilocalories).29

Statistical Analyses
We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
analyses to estimate the association between NSAID or aspirin-only use and overall mortality or CRC-specific mortality. All models included the categoric variable for
NSAID or aspirin-only use. Adjustment was made for variables known to predict survival in CRC: age, stage of disease at the time of presentation, disease site within the
colorectum (ie, colon or rectum), and family history of
CRC. Other potential confounders were not included in
models, because their inclusion did not change risk estimates by >5%. Local, regional, and advanced (ie, remote)
stages at presentation were categorized according to the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results summary
stage indicator when available.30 P values were not
adjusted for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses
5664

were performed using SAS statistical software (version
9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
NSAID Frequency Before CRC Diagnosis
Among the 621 CRC cases identified after formation of
the cohort, the observed median duration between baseline NSAID assessment and CRC diagnosis was 5.2
years (range, 0-10.1 years; mean duration, 5.2 years),
and the median follow-up duration after CRC diagnosis
was 2.8 years (range, 0-9.8 years; mean duration, 3.4
years). Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of
CRC cases in the CTS stratified by frequency of
NSAID use (no use vs regular use [defined as daily use,
use 4-6 times per week, or use 1-3 times per week]). As
can be seen in Table 1, these groups were similar across
most of the variables considered. Regular NSAID users
had a higher BMI than nonusers, and were more likely
to have undergone a recent mammogram. NSAID frequency usage and duration of NSAID use among CRC
cases are presented in Table 2. The majority (64%) of
cases did not use NSAIDs regularly, whereas 20% were
daily NSAID users. Among NSAID users, 39% (ie, 87
of 224 individuals) reported use for 10 years, and
50% (ie, 111 of 224 individuals) reported use for at
least 5 years.

Association Between NSAID Use and
CRC Survival
Cause of death analysis revealed that 222 (36%) of the
621 identified CRC cases died during the study period.
Of these 222 deaths, 145 (65%) were attributed to CRC.
Fifteen of the 222 deaths (6.8% of all deaths) were
because of heart disease.
The primary results are presented for analysis of
regular NSAID use compared with no regular NSAID
use. In the Cox models, after adjustment for age at diagnosis, family history of CRC in a first-degree relative,
disease site (colon or rectum), stage of disease at diagnosis, time from NSAID assessment to CRC diagnosis, and
treatment with surgery (yes/no), regular NSAID use was
found to be associated with a statistically significant
decreased risk of death compared with no regular

NSAID use (Table 3). For CRC-specific survival, the
hazards ratio (HR) was 0.58 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.40-0.84); for overall survival, the HR was
0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.95). Restricting analysis to colon
cancer cases, the multivariate relative hazards for regular
NSAID use versus no use revealed significant differences
in overall survival (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.97) and
CRC-specific survival (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90).
No significant differences were observed when the analysis was limited to patients with rectal cancer.
Results for CRC cases based on the duration of
NSAID use are presented in Table 4. Colorectal cancer
patients who reported using NSAIDs for at least 5 years
before diagnosis were found to have a statistically significant decreased risk of overall mortality after adjustment
for clinically relevant factors compared with those reporting no NSAID use (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.84). Similarly, a statistically significant decreased risk of CRC5666

specific mortality was observed in the multivariate analysis
for CRC patients reporting at least 5 years of NSAID use
before diagnosis compared with patients reporting no
NSAID use (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23-0.71). No statistically significant associations with overall or CRC-specific
mortality were observed for cases reporting <5 years duration of NSAID use compared with those reporting no
NSAID use. Among colon cancer patients, at least 5 years
duration of NSAID use before diagnosis was associated
with a significant reduction in CRC-specific mortality
(HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23-0.94), but not overall mortality
(HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.40-1.05). No significant differences were observed for subset analysis of NSAID duration
among rectal cancer patients. Time from NSAID assessment (at baseline) to CRC diagnosis was not found to be
significantly associated with mortality (data not shown).
Results shown in Tables 3 and 4 based on aspirin use
rather than all NSAIDs are consistent with the results for
all NSAID use.

DISCUSSION
In this analysis of women diagnosed with a first primary
invasive CRC after enrolling in the large CTS cohort, we
found that prediagnosis regular NSAID use and prolonged duration of NSAID use were independently associated with decreased overall mortality and CRC-specific
mortality. Prolonged NSAID duration (>5 years)
reported among women with subsequent diagnosis of
CRC was associated with a 50% (unadjusted) and 60%
(adjusted) lower risk of CRC-specific mortality. Aspirinonly survival effects were consistent with the effects
observed for NSAIDs. If confirmed in other studies, these

findings may have important implications for tertiary cancer prevention.
Because this was an analysis of prediagnosis NSAID
use, it is possible that the improvement in survival associated with NSAID use may be a consequence of prediagnosis NSAID use leading to the development of more
indolent, less aggressive cancers. Alternatively, prediagnosis NSAID use may simply reflect postdiagnosis NSAID
use, and potentially beneficial effects of NSAID use on
survival after CRC diagnosis. This is supported by data

regarding our surviving CRC patients, which indicated
that 82% who reported regular NSAID use in the prediagnosis questionnaire also reported regular NSAID use in a
later questionnaire that was completed in 2007 (data not
shown). Despite numerous studies reporting NSAID
effects on CRC risk, to the best of our knowledge only
limited data are available that describe NSAID effects on
survival among individuals with established colon or rectal cancer. In the male Health Professionals Study, aspirin
was associated with decreased risk of advanced stage CRC

and fatal CRC.24 In a prospective analysis of 803 stage III
colon cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (leucovorin-modulated 5-fluorouracil with or without
irinotecan), consistent aspirin use among 74 patients was
associated with statistically significant decreases in HRs
for disease recurrence and overall mortality.25 Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 overexpression is important in the progression of the colon adenoma-carcinoma sequence.31
Both the COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs have
been shown to induce apoptosis in colon cancer model
systems.3,4,32 Aspirin’s preventive effect on CRC carcinogenesis is limited to lowering the risk of COX-2–overexpressing tumors.33 A phase 1 clinical trial using celecoxib
in combination with leucovorin-modulated 5-fluorouracil
as treatment for advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma suggests that this regimen is safe and worthy of further investigation.34 Various NSAIDs have been used in phase 1, 2,
and 3 clinical trials in combination with either radiotherapy or chemotherapy for regional and metastatic colorectal cancer.34-36 However, the majority of these trials are
currently in progress, and survival outcomes are not yet
reported. COX-2 inhibitors have been described as
‘‘cotherapeutic agents’’ in the treatment of colorectal cancer,36 because of their primary effect of inhibiting tumor
growth rather than causing tumor regression.35,37 Therefore, incorporating COX-2 inhibitors or nonselective
NSAIDs into combination therapy with chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, other investigational chemopreventive
agents, or targeted therapies such as vascular endothelial
growth factor inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab) and epidermal
growth factor inhibitors (eg, cetuximab, panitumumab)
may prove beneficial.
NSAIDs exert their antiproliferative effects on colonic cells by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis through reversible binding to COX and through other mechanisms.
Aspirin has been noted to reduce the recurrence of adenomatous polyps in patients at moderate risk and with acceptable toxicity, but such is not the case for COX-2–
selective inhibitors. Several randomized trials have demonstrated that COX-2–selective NSAIDs result in a substantial reduction in adenoma recurrence, but at the cost
of significantly increased cardiovascular events.38,39 Thus,
COX-2–selective NSAIDs cannot be recommended routinely for CRC prevention. Whether similar adverse
results will be found with less selective NSAIDs awaits the
results of ongoing trials. In light of these data, the US Pre5668

ventive Services Task Force has recommended that, despite evidence of efficacy, NSAIDs are not warranted for
CRC prevention among average-risk individuals because
of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities.40 Of
note, only 6.8% of deaths in the current study were attributed to heart disease.
Family history itself was not found to be associated
with a decreased risk of overall mortality or CRC-specific
survival in the current study. Despite convincing evidence
that a family history of CRC is a risk factor for colorectal
polyps and cancer,41-44 conflicting reports have emerged
regarding the association of family history with survival
after CRC diagnosis. Consistent with our findings, a family history of CRC was not found to be associated with
survival after CRC diagnosis in the Melbourne CRC
cohort study45 or in a study from the Utah Population
Database.46 However, there is not a consensus on this
issue, because new studies have emerged demonstrating
survival benefits for colon cancer patients with a family
history of CRC compared with those without.47-50 It is
possible that unique cohort characteristics (ie, stage, sex,
ethnicity) and statistical power account for the different
observations concerning the effects of CRC family history
on survival after diagnosis of CRC.
The current study was based on a prospective study
design such that NSAID reporting predated CRC diagnosis, with cases accrued during a median cohort follow-up
of 10.1 years. Self-reported NSAID use was obtained
from the baseline questionnaire, whereas survival effects
may be more closely related to NSAID use after CRC diagnosis. Among our surviving CRC patients, we have
additional data regarding NSAID use obtained in 2007;
although 82% of those who reported using NSAIDs at
baseline continued their use, 38% of the nonusers from
the prediagnosis questionnaire reported regular NSAID
use in the later questionnaire. These subsequent NSAID
assessments were collected in the final year of follow-up
for mortality, meaning that deceased cases could not provide relevant data regarding NSAID use. Thus, we cannot
determine how changing patterns of NSAID use over
time influenced CRC mortality. We also recognize that
our findings could reflect effects of lead time bias if
NSAID use were associated with earlier diagnosis because
of early symptomatology (eg, rectal bleeding). Our analyses of rectal cancer were limited in sample size and therefore in the number of deaths occurring in this group,

resulting in low statistical power to detect effects of
NSAID use on survival. The study has several other important limitations, including a lack of information
regarding screening practices such as fecal occult blood
testing or the use of endoscopy (colonoscopy or flexible
sigmoidoscopy). It is recognized that screening may be
associated with NSAID use, and thus differences in
screening could theoretically explain the observed associations. In the current analysis, there were observed differences in the screening rates for mammograms but not
Papanicolaou smears between CRC patients reporting
regular NSAID use and those reporting no regular
NSAID use, but stage of CRC at diagnosis did not appear
to vary by NSAID use (Table 1). Detailed NSAID history
was not available, including information regarding the
specific type of NSAID and dosage, information regarding NSAIDs other than aspirin or ibuprofen, and information concerning current or former use. In addition, our
study was underpowered to investigate risk differences
based on tumor subsite location within the colon or
rectum.
The findings of the current study cannot support a
general recommendation for NSAID use as tertiary prevention of colorectal cancer among CRC patients. However, they do justify future validation studies to better
understand prediagnostic and postdiagnostic NSAID use
among CRC cases and underscore the importance of performing clinical trials of NSAID tertiary prevention in
CRC patients, such as those being planned in the cooperative group setting. These findings clearly suggest that prior
NSAID use patterns are an important variable to consider
when planning and interpreting future trials, and that
completed therapeutic trials demonstrating benefit may
need to revisit whether prior NSAID use patterns were
adequately addressed in the study design and analysis.
