BACKGROUND. Up-regulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression has been
shown in several tumors and is thought to represent an important endogenous
response to tumor progression. The authors aimed to verify the expression of
VDR and its clinical significance in histologically proven cholangiocarcinoma
(CCA).

able prognosis for CCA. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, an active metabolite of
vitamin D3, in the CCA cell lines with high expression of VDR significantly
reduced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect was not
demonstrated in the CCA cell lines that had lower VDR expression.

CONCLUSIONS. These data indicated an active role for VDR in mediating the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in CCA cell lines. VDR expression may constitute an important prerequisite for using vitamin D and/or its analogs in the
treatment of CCA. Investigation of a mechanism by which VDR and its ligand
mediate these processes is needed to provide the basis for the potential use of
this hormone and its derivatives in the prevention and treatment of CCA. Cancer

he active metabolite of vitamin D3—1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)—helps maintain mineral homeostasis and normal skeletal architecture. Apart from these calcium-related actions,
1,25(OH)2D3 is also recognized as a regulator of growth and differentiation of many tissues such as skin, muscle, and heart.1 The actions
of 1,25(OH)2D3 are mediated through vitamin D receptors (VDRs),
which belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor super
family. 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptors form a complex that binds to
vitamin D-responsive elements, and it either positively or negatively
affects transcription.2 The VDR ligand-binding domain acts as a molecular switch, because its interactions with corepressor or coactivator proteins are the central molecular events that trigger nuclear
vitamin D3 signaling.

An association among 1,25(OH)2D3, VDR, and
cancer has been recognized since epidemiological
studies indicated an inverse relation between levels
of vitamin D3 and risk of many types of cancer.3 In
addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 has been found to regulate differentiation and growth of several cultured human
cell lines.4,5 Moreover, the protective effects of
1,25(OH)2D3 against cancers are evident in neoplasms
of the colon, breast, prostate, and other sites.6,7
The physiological and pharmacological actions of
1,25(OH)2D3 in many pathologic conditions, along
with the detection of high VDR expression in target
cells, have signaled potential therapeutic applications
of VDR ligands for osteoporosis, dermatological indications, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and
cancers (ie, prostate, colon, breast, myelodysplasia,
leukemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,
and basal cell carcinoma). Consequently, many
1,25(OH)2D3 analogs with noncalcific actions have
been developed, with the goal of improving the biological profile of the natural hormone for its therapeutic application for antiproliferative, prodifferentiative,
and immunomodulatory effects.8,9
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant neoplasm arising from the biliary epithelium, either
within the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary tract.
Even though CCA is rare worldwide, the incidence
and mortality rates of CCA in the past 3 decades have
grown in the USA, the UK, Japan, and Australia.10,11
Because its prognosis is poor and effective therapy is
lacking, CCA is usually a fatal cancer. Therefore, novel
treatment strategies directed against this malignancy
constitute an urgent task.
Molecular alterations associated with CCA have
been made by using different high-throughput techniques.12,13 Exploiting select molecular targets that are
aberrantly expressed during carcinogenesis and metastasis of CCA is 1 approach being used to develop
specific chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies.
Accordingly, we first applied a comparative genomics
approach by using the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) database (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE).
A comparison of SAGE data of tissues obtained from
metastatic CCA and normal liver indicated that several genes are up-regulated in CCA tissues. We
focused on the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene (SAGE
tag: GAGAAACCCT) because 1,25(OH)2D3 has recently
been used in chemoprevention and therapeutics for
human tumors.8,9
Thus, the expression of VDR in tumor tissues was
investigated from 111 patients with histologically proven CCAs. The association of VDR expression and
clinical findings from patients, and the antiproliferative activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 on CCA cell lines, were

determined. Here, we show for the first time that
VDRs are aberrantly expressed during development
of CCA and that the expression of VDRs is a good
prognostic marker of CCA. Supplementation of
1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced proliferation of
CCA cells. In addition, the antiproliferative effects
of 1,25(OH)2D3 demonstrated in CCA cell lines were
mediated by VDR. These findings suggest that supplementation of 1,25(OH)2D3 or its analogs may be a
potential strategy for long-term control of tumor development and progression in CCA patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and Tissues
Paraffin-embedded liver tissues of patients with histologically proven CCA who underwent liver resection (n ¼ 111) were obtained from the specimen
bank of the Liver Fluke and Cholangiocarcinoma
Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen
University, Thailand. Informed consent was obtained
from each subject, and the Khon Kaen University
Ethics Committee for Human Research approved the
research protocol (HE 471214). Normal and hyperplastic/dysplastic biliary epithelia were examined
from the noncancerous portion of liver tissues
obtained from CCA patients. Tumor location
(n ¼ 99), tumor size (n ¼ 82), pTNM stage,14 and
histological grading (n ¼ 111) were evaluated by
reviewing medical charts and pathology records.
Cell Lines and Proliferation Assay
Four CCA cell lines, M139, M213, OCA17, and
KKU100, were established as described.15 Cells were
cultured in Ham F12 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin at 378C and 5% CO2.
CCA cells (3 3 103 cells/well) were plated in a
96-well culture plate for 24 hours. Media with various
concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, Mo) were added to a final volume of 100 lL
per well. Plates were incubated further for 72 hours,
and cell numbers were determined by using sulforhodamine B assay (SRB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Mo). Briefly, the culture medium was removed, 10%
cold trichloroacetic acid was added for 30 minutes at
room temperature, and subsequently washed 5 times
with deionized water. The plate was air dried, and
0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid was added for 30 minutes. Unbound dye was washed out 5 times with 1%
acetic acid. After air drying, SRB dye within cells was
solubilized with 200 lL of 10 mM unbuffered Trisbase solution. The plate was shaken for at least 10
minutes, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm

by using a microplate reader (Tecan Austria GmbH,
Salzburg, Austria).

Semiquantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The total RNA of the CCA cell line was extracted by
using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), and generated to cDNA by Ready to Go reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Single tube, semiquantitative, RT-PCR analysis was
used to determine mRNA expression levels of VDR
and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (The latter was used as an internal standard.) The number of PCR cycles was determined to
yield a linear range of PCR amplification products
for VDR and GAPDH. The following specific PCR primers for VDR and GAPDH mRNAs were used, VDR
forward primer, 50 -TGT CCT GGA CCT GTG GCA AC30 ; VDR reverse primer, 50 -AGG ACG ATC TGG GGA
GAC GA-30 and GAPDH forward primer 50 -AAT GCC
TCC TGC ACC ACC-30 ; reverse primer 50 -CTG TTG
AAG TCA GAG GAG AC-30 . The sizes of the generated
PCR products were 182 base pairs (bp) for the VDRs
and 416 bp for the GAPDH. The thermal cycle conditions for VDR and GAPDH included 1) denaturation
at 948C for 2 minutes; 2) 35 cycles of denaturation at
948C for 30 seconds; 3) annealing at 658C for 30 seconds; 4) extension at 688C for 1 minute; and, 5) a
final extension at 688C for 10 minutes (MBS satellite
0.2G Thermal cycler; Thermo Electron, Milford,
Mass). The PCR product (5 lL) was separated on
2.0% agarose gel. The intensity of each band was
quantified by using GelPro 32 (Media Cybernetics,
Bethesda, Md). Water was used as a negative control
instead of a cDNA product in order to reveal any
false-positive reactions.
Immunohistochemistry
VDR protein was detected on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections by using the standard immunohistochemistry technique. Briefly, deparaffinized
tissue sections were blocked with 3% H2O2 and nonimmune horse serum for 30 minutes. Afterward,
slides were heated in a boiling pressure in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 4 minutes. The slides were
allowed to react at room temperature overnight with
1:400 rat anti-VDR monoclonal antibody (Chemicon;
Temecula, Calif ). The slides were then incubated
with 1:100 goat antirat IgG (H1L) (Zymed Laboratories; San Francisco, Calif). The peroxidase activity
was observed by using diaminobenzidine tetrahydroxychloride solution (DAB; Dako; Glostrup, Denmark) as the substrate. The sections were

2499

counterstained with hematoxylin. The positive staining was eliminated when phosphate-buffered saline
was applied instead of the primary antibody. The
staining frequency of VDR was semiquantitatively
scored on the basis of the percentage of positive cells
as: 0 ¼ negative; 11 ¼ 1% to 25%; 21 ¼ 26–50%;
and 31>50%. In some analyses, the VDR expressions
of 11, 21, and 31 were summed as for cumulative
positive VDR expression.

Statistical Analysis
The analyses were performed by using SPSS 14.0 for
Windows Evaluation software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Ill). Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the association between VDR expression and clinical factors
of CCA patients. The cumulative survival after tumor
removal was calculated according to the KaplanMeier method, with a log-rank test. A multivariate
survival analysis was performed on parameters found
to be significant in univariate analysis by the Cox
proportional hazard regression model. P < .05 was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Of the 111 CCA patients examined, 78.37% were men
and the ratio of men to women was 3.6 to 1. The
median age of the CCA patients was 55 years (range,
29 to 73 years). In our series, peripheral CCA
(78.68%) was the major type, and most of the tumors
(87.70%) were at an advanced stage (ie, IVA or IVB).
Survival of each patient after surgery was recorded
until April 27, 2006. Ninety percent of the patients
died by the end of the follow-up period.
The operative procedures for all patients were
intended for cure; however, the pathology record
showed 58.5% (65 of 111) of cases were margin free.
In this series, 18.9% (21 of 111) of patients received
complete chemotherapy after surgery, and none of
the patients received postoperative radiotherapy.

Expression of VDR in Bile Duct Epithelia and CCA Tissue
VDR was rarely expressed in normal bile duct epithelia, and only 20% of normal bile ducts showed positive staining with low expression (Fig. 1a). In
contrast, VDR was expressed more frequently in precancerous (hyperplasia and dysplasia) biliary epithelial cells and CCA tissues than in normal bile duct
epithelia (P < .001) (Table 1). The frequency of positive staining of VDR was gradually increased in hyperplasia to dysplasia and CCA (Fig. 1b-d) (Table 1).
More than 74% of CCA tissues showed positive VDR
staining, 40% of which had highly expressed VDR. In
all cases, VDR was mostly detected in cytoplasm.

Correlation Between VDR Expression and
Clinicopathologic Features
By using a univariate analysis, the association of
VDR expression in CCA tissues with patients’ clinicopathology was determined. The expression of tissue
VDR had no association with age, sex, tumor type,
tumor stage, tumor size, or metastasis; however, it
was significantly correlated with histological grading
(Fig. 2). The proportion of patients with positive VDR
was significantly higher in those with papillary (15 of

Antiproliferative Activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 in CCA Cell Lines
In the current study, 4 human CCA cell lines—
namely M139, M213, KKU100, and OCA17—were
selected to assess the role of VDR in the antiproliferative activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 in CCA. VDR expression levels in CCA cell lines were determined by
semiquantitative PCR, using GAPDH as the internal
standard. VDR expression of cell line M213 was significantly higher than those of cell lines M139,
KKU100, and OCA17 (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4).
All cell lines were treated by different concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 days. 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly decreased proliferation of M139 and M213
(P < .05) in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5); by
comparison, the CCA cell lines KKU100 and OCA17
did not respond.

DISCUSSION
The aberrant expression of VDR during development
of CCA was addressed in this study through an immunohistochemical examination of VDR expression
in 111 CCA tissues. A higher expression of VDR was

plasia and CCA tissues: More than 74% of primary
CCA tissues overexpressed VDR. Up-regulation of
VDR has been reported also in primary tumor tissues
of breast,16 colon,17 and pancreatic cancers.18 High
expression of VDR in preneoplastic lesions—established tumors and lung metastases of MMTV-neu
transgenic mouse model of breast cancer—also have
been demonstrated.19 Aberrant expression of VDR in
hyperplastic and/or dysplastic biliary cells, as
reported in the present study, may be part of early
molecular events that were altered during malignant
formation of CCA. However, this observation is only
correlative; investigations into the molecular
mechanism(s), which dysregulates normal VDR signaling in CCA development, are needed. This may
generate opportunities for therapeutic intervention,
achieved through disruption of CCA tumorigenesis.
In the present study, there is no significant correlation of VDR expression with tumor size, tumor
stage, or metastasis. This suggests that VDR expression may not associate with tumor progression of
CCA. However, the expression of VDR in CCA tissues

is significantly correlated with histological type of
CCA. More than 80% of CCA patients with papillary
type and 90% of well differentiated type CCA had
positive VDR expression (Fig. 2). Both histological
types are known to possess good prognosis compared with poorly differentiated types.20,21 This observation implies that high expression of VDR may
correlate with good prognosis CCA. This postulation
may be supported by the fact that 1,25(OH)2D3, and
its potent analogs, can induce growth arrest and differentiation of some cancer cells.22,23 In the present
study, expression of VDR and postoperative chemotherapy were found to be independent prognostic
variables for better survival of CCA patients, regardless of histological type, tumor type, tumor stage,
and metastasis, (Table 2). Patients who were positive
for tumor VDR expression had significantly longer
survival than those who were not. A similar observation has also been reported for patients with colon
cancer24 and esophageal cancers.25
The antiproliferative activities of 1,25(OH)2D3
were determined in 4 CCA cell lines with high
(M139, M213) and low (OCA17, KKU100) expressions
of VDR. In a dose-dependent fashion, 1,25(OH)2D3
significantly suppressed growth of CCA cell lines
M139 and M213 although not in cell lines OCA17
and KKU100. Cells with higher numbers of VDR
tended to be more sensitive to the effect of
1,25(OH)2D3 on growth, in agreement with other
reports.18,26,27 The positive correlation between VDR
expression levels and the antiproliferative activity of
1,25(OH)2D3, as demonstrated in the current study,
also has been reported on several other cancer cell
lines.26 Transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells
with antisense VDR significantly reduced antiproliferative sensitivity28 to 1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast,29
transfection of VDR expression vector to HBL100, a
vitamin D resistant human breast epithelial cell line,
enhanced sensitivity of cells to the growth inhibitory
effect of 1,25(OH)2D3.
Vitamin D3 is a seco-steroid hormone that regulates calcium homeostasis within the body. It is also
recognized as a regulator of growth and differentiation of many tissues. Vitamin D3 exerts its activity
through both genomic and nongenomic pathways.
The genomic actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 are modulated
through the VDR. Most dividing cell types, normal
and malignant, can express VDR and respond to
1,25(OH)2D3. Significant antineoplastic activity of
1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown in preclinical models;
of which different mechanisms have been proposed
according to tumor models and experimental conditions. These include inhibition of proliferation associated with cell cycle arrest,23,30,31 differentiation,32,33

reduction invasiveness and angiogenesis,34,35 and stimulation of apoptosis.36 In the present study, cells
treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 induced apoptosis as
observed in CCA cell line M213.
In addition to genomic effects, vitamin D also
regulates a number of cytoplasmic signaling pathways, such as protein kinase; ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).37 These actions often
result in rapid changes in intracellular calcium and
activation or deactivation of a number of proteins,
which finally affect cellular growth, differentiation,
and apoptosis. Several studies, however, suggest that
VDR is required for expression of gene products
involved in nongenomic response. The exact role of
VDR in this action remains to be determined.
1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) and multiple analogs
with reduced calcific properties are under investigation in numerous cultured cell types26,38,39 and in
several in vivo animal models.40 Calcitriol, the principal biologically active ligand of VDR has been shown
to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in both in vitro
and in vivo models of a wide range of neoplasms.

Efficacy of calcitriol and its analogs on cancer prevention and therapy has been explored in prostate
cancer,41,42 colon cancer,43 and breast cancer.44
In the present study, the genomic action of vitamin D3 through VDR is emphasized. The association
of VDR expression in CCA tissue indicating a good
prognosis, together with the reduction of cell proliferation by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, suggest the possibility
of using vitamin D as an adjuvant therapy for CCA
patients who have high expression of VDR. However,
investigation of a mechanism by which VDR and its
ligand mediate these processes is needed to provide
the basis for the potential use of this hormone and its
derivatives in the prevention and treatment of CCA.
